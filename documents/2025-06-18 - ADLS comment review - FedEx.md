## Transcript
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Hey, Jerome.
**Ahuettl**: Hey.
**Ahuettl**: How's it going there?
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Good, good.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Hey, I'm not going to take up a ton of your time.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: I just wanted to get ahead of these comments.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: See, they still haven't finished their review, which is just unreal to me.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: And then they had a lot more comments than I expected.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Yeah, I'm in the truck right now.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: I'm actually at the Avon Project.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: So let me pull up project docs.
**Ahuettl**: Yep.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: And I'm gonna screenshot these and just send them to you.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Okay.
**Ahuettl**: Yep.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: It would let me log in.
**Ahuettl**: It seems like every project with Carmel is more work than it should be.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: But, I mean, they.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: They gave me.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: I have almost 25, so a lot of them are repetitive.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: But let me share my screen.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Okay.
**Ahuettl**: Yep.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: You see that?
**Ahuettl**: Yep.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Here it's saying, please add lintels above the four proposed windows.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Thank you.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: So what are they asking for there?
**Ahuettl**: I mean, it looks like they want a.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Like a limestone type.
**Ahuettl**: That's.
**Ahuettl**: To me, that looks like.
**Ahuettl**: I mean, that's what.
**Ahuettl**: What it looks like to me.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: So maybe what if we did like a soldier line and brick above them?
**Ahuettl**: Yeah.
**Ahuettl**: Is there anything else?
**Ahuettl**: I mean, we can get clarification on that.
**Ahuettl**: I mean, it just.
**Ahuettl**: So we kind of like do this hopefully once and you know, it.
**Ahuettl**: But I would say.
**Ahuettl**: I would say yes.
**Ahuettl**: Either.
**Ahuettl**: Either.
**Ahuettl**: Or whether it's a little cast stone band through there.
**Ahuettl**: So.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Yeah, they have this at four locations.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: 1, 2, 3, 4.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: So that's number one.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Please revise note three to read with a description for the new entrance design and materials.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Instead of the previous entrance canopy that mimicked the Harvest Market primary entrance.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: That's just as easy as putting a note in there.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah, I'll have to.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: This says, please revise dimensions to reflect new design.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: I thought it already did.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah, it should.
**Ahuettl**: Maybe we can add one right there, but.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah, we can.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: That's an easy fix, right?
**Ahuettl**: Yeah.
**Ahuettl**: I mean, we were using those for the openings.
**Ahuettl**: Really?
**Ahuettl**: I mean, everything else is on the plans.
**Ahuettl**: All right.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Yeah, same thing.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Please add or note the location of the future and second tenants signage.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Spandrel panel.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Sure.
**Ahuettl**: Yep.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Please add labels for materials shown at the new entrance canopies.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Easy enough.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: I know you call it out in like a cross section or something.
**Ahuettl**: Yep.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Same thing here with that signage.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Revise Note 3 to read for the description.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Okay.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: That's the same thing.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Revised dimensions.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: You got that?
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Lentils?
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: We got that.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Are any sconces Propose and.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: No, we're just proposing can lights.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Right.
**Ahuettl**: We had just the light.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Yeah.
**Ahuettl**: Just the recessed lights.
**Ahuettl**: But.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Yeah.
**Ahuettl**: So, I mean, are they.
**Ahuettl**: I feel like they're kind of getting at.
**Ahuettl**: They're asking for that without asking for it is what it kind of looks like.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: That's unreal.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: That would look weird.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: There's no.
**Ahuettl**: That's what I'm saying.
**Ahuettl**: Like, it seems weird that that would be a.
**Ahuettl**: Like.
**Ahuettl**: Well, if they're not on the drawings, why would you think that we're, you know, proposing them.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Flank the entrances or our recessed lights within the canopies?
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: The only proposed fixtures.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Just respond.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Recessed lights are the only.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: And if they want us to do it, then.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Okay.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: So she says this sign will not be perpet.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Sign will not be permitted.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Okay.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: For this three square foot.
**Ahuettl**: Was that.
**Ahuettl**: Was that just the grass?
**Ahuettl**: The.
**Ahuettl**: Like the window?
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: What am I.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Yeah, that's what it looks like.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: This is all signage stuff.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Staff does not believe these custom parking signs are needed.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: And so when I can respond, I'll just say, okay, we will remove.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Or something like that.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: This is more signage.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Okay.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Please identify where garbage will be picked up.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Just these guys.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Garbage is going to be picked up.
**Ahuettl**: Shoot.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: They actually kind of have a good point.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: It'd just be in the dumpsters out back, I would assume.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah, I'm gonna pull that.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah, it's a little bit of a walk.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Well, there's no walk along the side of the building.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah.
**Ahuettl**: I mean, where Neiman's is, that is all of their trash inside.
**Ahuettl**: Do they have like a.
**Ahuettl**: At their loading dock?
**Ahuettl**: I mean, is that.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Yeah, yeah.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah.
**Ahuettl**: Let me know what you think on.
**Ahuettl**: On how we respond to that one.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Yeah, I don't know what I think.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: I didn't think of that.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Please identify where garbage will be picked up.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Okay, so this one, reference 18.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Please provide context on the expected use of the vestibule and entry off trip.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: This will be used by employees and patrons.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: The answer to that is no.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: This is just for egress purposes only.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Because.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Aaa.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: AAA ways there.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: We don't want people coming in and out of there.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah, yeah.
**Ahuettl**: Just so they can both.
**Ahuettl**: So they can both have a shared exit.
**Ahuettl**: Yep.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: And that's in.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: In light of a fire or something.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah.
**Ahuettl**: Yep.
**Ahuettl**: Yep.
**Ahuettl**: That's an easy response.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Okay, here's a snow.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: There's signage one.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: We got that signage fix.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: That signage fix.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Please provide spandrel panel dimensions as outlined in red.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Maximum sign size is determined at 70% of spandrel panel height.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: At 85% of spandrel height.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Okay.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Easy Merchant square sign package requires sign to be flush mounted to building fascia.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: There will be on the spandrel panel for all the electrical.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Yes, there will be.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Okay.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: And then no comments.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: So would it be easier if I just gave you my login info?
**Ahuettl**: Either that or yeah, feel free to.
**Ahuettl**: I thought, like, when I've gotten these before, she's actually, I think just like.
**Ahuettl**: Like, copied and pasted them to me on other projects.
**Ahuettl**: But either that or you might be able to just PDF out that page.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Yeah, I'll try and get you something.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: But that's.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: That's what they have so far, so I can't imagine there being any other more crazy comments than that.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: So we just need to get these adjusted.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: I'll get an answer on the garbage and we'll go from there.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Okay?
**Ahuettl**: Yeah, yeah, these aren't.
**Ahuettl**: These aren't too bad.
**Ahuettl**: Let me know on the garbage and we'll get it.
**Ahuettl**: We'll get these back pretty quick.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Okay?
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: All right, man.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Appreciate it.
**Ahuettl**: Yep.
**Ahuettl**: Then when I get in there, I'll let you know if I have any other questions.
**Ahuettl**: And then did you see that text about.
**Ahuettl**: About the openings?
**Ahuettl**: Their structural engineer just asked if they were.
**Ahuettl**: If they were marked.
**Ahuettl**: He just wanted to see those in relation to the.
**Ahuettl**: Any of the joints.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: So I connected.
