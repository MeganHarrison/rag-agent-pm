## Transcript
**Jdawson**: Chapman.
**Speaker 1**: Good morning, sir.
**Jdawson**: You need a hug?
**Speaker 1**: Do I need a hug after what.
**Jdawson**: Your team lost last night?
**Speaker 1**: I was.
**Jdawson**: Andrew's so depressed.
**Jdawson**: He.
**Jdawson**: He hasn't got out of bed yet.
**Speaker 1**: I think it's Friday night, but.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I mean, they play tonight.
**Speaker 1**: They gotta win.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Speaker 1**: Sorry.
**Jdawson**: I'm eating breakfast.
**Speaker 1**: Let me go grab the cap to my coffee I left out there.
**Speaker 1**: All right.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: I'm all ears.
**Jdawson**: All right, so which of your jobs have you done a PSR on?
**Jdawson**: One of the newer ones.
**Speaker 1**: You could do.
**Speaker 1**: I mean, Ulta Dallas.
**Jdawson**: Like one with Job Planner, since that's what we're trying to do.
**Speaker 1**: I've never done.
**Speaker 1**: I haven't done one with Job Planner yet.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: June will be my first one with a bunch of Job Planner ones.
**Jdawson**: All right, well, let's just do one.
**Jdawson**: So Applied Engineering started this week, right?
**Speaker 1**: Well, today, technically.
**Jdawson**: Not.
**Speaker 1**: Not started.
**Speaker 1**: Alex is getting floor protection down.
**Speaker 1**: We're starting tomorrow.
**Speaker 1**: I got a bunch of Lois out, but I gotta get.
**Speaker 1**: I gotta get contracts out today.
**Jdawson**: So you could do.
**Speaker 1**: Do Neiman.
**Speaker 1**: Do Neiman.
**Jdawson**: Well, is Neiman starting.
**Jdawson**: When is Neiman starting?
**Speaker 1**: Whenever we get the permit we got.
**Speaker 1**: Guys, we started a little early today with running some electrical to get a head start.
**Jdawson**: So if you go into.
**Jdawson**: Just go into your folder and go into Applied and open up the PSR form.
**Jdawson**: The one I got on the screen?
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Start filling it out.
**Jdawson**: So basically like, do you have an updated.
**Jdawson**: Where's the latest proposal for this job?
**Jdawson**: For Applied Replied.
**Speaker 1**: It's there in the.
**Speaker 1**: It's Castle Creek four final.
**Jdawson**: What's this one?
**Speaker 1**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so you take this.
**Jdawson**: That form.
**Jdawson**: If you just save it in another screen and you fill all this out.
**Jdawson**: Obviously, what's your first month of work will be this month.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So it'd be June.
**Speaker 1**: Here, I'm opening it now.
**Speaker 1**: I see you're in it.
**Jdawson**: So, yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So this is June.
**Speaker 1**: And that would be June ends on the 30th.
**Jdawson**: How long does the job supposed to take?
**Speaker 1**: I have it.
**Speaker 1**: September 11th.
**Jdawson**: There you go.
**Jdawson**: Forms.
**Jdawson**: Good.
**Jdawson**: And then you set June comments.
**Jdawson**: So anything you want to talk about if these numbers don't look good, you put over here.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Jdawson**: There's all kinds of things here, but project name, that's obvious.
**Jdawson**: Project start date is today.
**Jdawson**: Your budget's 477,087.
**Speaker 1**: Original fee.
**Speaker 1**: What do we have there?
**Jdawson**: 212.
**Speaker 1**: What is it?
**Speaker 1**: 31.
**Jdawson**: 31,212.
**Jdawson**: Your insurance is 5,320.
**Jdawson**: Your current completion date is still 9 11.
**Jdawson**: Great.
**Jdawson**: Date, by the way.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Seriously.
**Jdawson**: Current budget hasn't changed.
**Speaker 1**: All right.
**Jdawson**: Budget 774-77087.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, not that much.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Current fee three one, two.
**Jdawson**: One, two.
**Jdawson**: One, two, two.
**Jdawson**: God damn it, dude.
**Speaker 1**: Fat fingers.
**Speaker 1**: 5320.
**Jdawson**: And of course, by the end of this month, maybe you get the buyout done.
**Jdawson**: You got a couple weeks, so you can update that.
**Jdawson**: But.
**Jdawson**: So now if we open up, I will open up Planner, engineering, first thing, contracts.
**Jdawson**: We're supposed to be starting this today and we don't have a contract created.
**Jdawson**: So that's a problem.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I put the budget in there on.
**Speaker 1**: On Friday.
**Speaker 1**: So they still haven't signed their contract, but they said they're signing it.
**Speaker 1**: So we're kind of.
**Speaker 1**: I'm kind of a little gun shy.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: That's not a line in here because you may want.
**Jdawson**: We may want to add that line just in case things like this where we're starting to work, we don't have a signed contract.
**Jdawson**: Not ideal, but.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: We seem to do that all the time.
**Speaker 1**: In an email they say we're approved for the 477.
**Speaker 1**: But I'm not going to let it get too out of hand.
**Speaker 1**: We're going to at least go get the temporary wall up and everything.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: And then go to commitments.
**Jdawson**: So we got everything in draft.
**Jdawson**: Who's starting today?
**Speaker 1**: No one is starting today.
**Speaker 1**: We're just.
**Speaker 1**: Alex is just getting floor protection down.
**Jdawson**: And these all been sent to the subs.
**Speaker 1**: I got Lois to them.
**Speaker 1**: But today I have to get one to deem into integrity.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so this report were happening today.
**Jdawson**: There's no open change orders and open pcos.
**Jdawson**: I don't.
**Jdawson**: And like sub change orders not funded.
**Jdawson**: If that.
**Jdawson**: What that means is if you wrote like a change order to a sub, but we don't have an owner change order.
**Jdawson**: No open RFIs.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Open submittals or how many total submittals do you have in here?
**Speaker 1**: I don't have any submittals yet for this project.
**Speaker 1**: Got about two weeks of demo.
**Jdawson**: Where's the submittal?
**Speaker 1**: Right there.
**Jdawson**: Right there.
**Jdawson**: So you haven't built a submittal log yet.
**Jdawson**: So that's another problem.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Jdawson**: So that's almost like all sub billing that'll come.
**Jdawson**: So job today cost.
**Jdawson**: If you look at your budget, you got $727 been spent already.
**Jdawson**: It just labor, I'm sure.
**Speaker 1**: No, I think it was like Dylan's computer.
**Jdawson**: Oh yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So I'm going to close this now.
**Jdawson**: Let's go look because you're watching Glenn these days.
**Jdawson**: So let's go to his last PSR M.
**Speaker 1**: S.A.
**Jdawson**: All right, so we started off with contract 7473.
**Jdawson**: It's increased to 7531 835.
**Jdawson**: It's current fee.
**Speaker 1**: 685,977.
**Jdawson**: And this is where did you get the message about setting up your job to make sure the markup is correct or you're going to have a nightmare.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Of doing budget modifications.
**Jdawson**: And a calculator is going to be wore out trying to figure out how much in each one it is because it's.
**Jdawson**: It's not.
**Jdawson**: I don't know if you underst.
**Jdawson**: Or if it makes sense when I sent that out, but it's putting the fee and insurance into the subs line is just a lump sum their cost plus our fee and insurance.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I haven't ran into that yet that.
**Speaker 1**: That problem yet.
**Speaker 1**: But aren't you.
**Speaker 1**: When you set up the job, you have to just put in.
**Jdawson**: Go to your.
**Jdawson**: Go to your.
**Jdawson**: Share your screen and open up your job planner and then we'll just create your owner's contract.
**Jdawson**: You don't have to fill everything in, but you can start it and get that fixed right off the bat.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So you go.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I've done it.
**Speaker 1**: I did it on.
**Speaker 1**: Just make sure I'm doing it the right way here.
**Jdawson**: Do it real quick.
**Jdawson**: Did you enter them as a contact already?
**Speaker 1**: They just sent us our W9.
**Speaker 1**: I'm not sure.
**Speaker 1**: I gotta follow up with accounting and make sure they added them.
**Jdawson**: Well, I don't think they're going to add contacts for you, but you can.
**Jdawson**: You can make a new contact.
**Jdawson**: Just put your.
**Jdawson**: You want to put.
**Jdawson**: If you have them like their accountant for the job and then their main contact or you can put all their contacts in there.
**Jdawson**: But you know, for the contract it only gives you two people I think to link to it.
**Speaker 1**: So it's important for as far as invoice contacts go.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: You have your one job contact and then an invoice contact definitely on your subcontractors.
**Jdawson**: They won't be able to bill through job planner.
**Jdawson**: Go here.
**Speaker 1**: I know, I know.
**Speaker 1**: I had them add them.
**Jdawson**: So if you go to your like the settings.
**Speaker 1**: Back in the project, you say.
**Jdawson**: Well, no, just the overall company settings is where you contacts.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So you go down to contacts.
**Jdawson**: Where is that?
**Jdawson**: Or maybe it's address book.
**Speaker 1**: I did notice this, Jesse, while I'm thinking of it, do you want.
**Speaker 1**: When we enter a daily Report in job planner.
**Jdawson**: It's.
**Speaker 1**: The owner is getting a notification because this west guy on this little hero sushi job sent me something.
**Speaker 1**: He's like, hey, am I supposed to be doing anything with this?
**Speaker 1**: I guess anytime.
**Speaker 1**: Alex was entering a.
**Speaker 1**: A daily report, it was sending it to the owner.
**Speaker 1**: Do you want the owner to see those daily reports?
**Jdawson**: No, you need to go.
**Jdawson**: We need to fix that on this.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: General settings.
**Jdawson**: So if you go to.
**Jdawson**: I think this is address book.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: This is user types.
**Speaker 1**: There we go.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So owners.
**Jdawson**: I think you just need to open them up.
**Speaker 1**: Permissions.
**Jdawson**: There we go.
**Speaker 1**: You don't want them to view the markup.
**Jdawson**: You don't.
**Jdawson**: Adding RFIs.
**Speaker 1**: We don't even need them to view RFIs, do we?
**Jdawson**: I mean, if they want to view them.
**Jdawson**: I don't.
**Jdawson**: It depends.
**Jdawson**: It's up to you.
**Speaker 1**: Punch list.
**Speaker 1**: They can't add.
**Speaker 1**: They can view the schedule, right?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Don't delete comments.
**Jdawson**: You can do submittals, contract change orders.
**Jdawson**: I don't know.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: On contracts they have access to, that's fine.
**Jdawson**: But edit schedule of values.
**Jdawson**: I wouldn't let them do that.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I'm not sure why they were able to see the daily reports.
**Jdawson**: But if you save this, it'll change it so they won't.
**Jdawson**: Cool.
**Speaker 1**: Well, anyway, back to the applied.
**Speaker 1**: Sorry, I was just thinking of that.
**Speaker 1**: It was on my notes to ask if you guys wanted to see it because Wes kept sending me this.
**Speaker 1**: He's like, hey, man, can't.
**Speaker 1**: What am I supposed to do with this?
**Speaker 1**: I was like, you're not supposed to do anything.
**Speaker 1**: Luckily, it was Smoke's job.
**Speaker 1**: New contract.
**Jdawson**: I guess.
**Speaker 1**: All right, what's going on?
**Jdawson**: Oh, nothing.
**Jdawson**: You're entering a new contact.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I'll fix all this later, but just for the purpose of learning.
**Jdawson**: So then you go to financial markups.
**Speaker 1**: Add markup insurance, and that's 1.25.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Jdawson**: I think he changed it at 1.35.
**Speaker 1**: 1.35 now.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Cost codes.
**Speaker 1**: This will go to insurance.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Speaker 1**: Expense.
**Jdawson**: And that is vertical.
**Speaker 1**: Vertical.
**Jdawson**: And apply to changes only.
**Jdawson**: That's it.
**Speaker 1**: Save that, then do a new one for fee.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: This is going to be.
**Speaker 1**: I think we're 10 on this job.
**Speaker 1**: We're not 10 or not.
**Jdawson**: We agreed to less than 10.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I think we were hungry for the job at the time when we, you know, been months ago, back in like November.
**Jdawson**: So if you go to your estimate, what is it for the proposal, like 7%, maybe?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, seven.
**Speaker 1**: Save it.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: There, that's done.
**Jdawson**: Now we can go back to.
**Jdawson**: Go back to the Westfield Collective.
**Jdawson**: Let's go through that PSR sa.
**Speaker 1**: Where is it as a whole?
**Speaker 1**: Right here.
**Jdawson**: Well, the SR 525.
**Jdawson**: It's that one with the date.
**Jdawson**: This one report.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So the contract went up by.
**Jdawson**: I guess we pull his budget and just see if these numbers line up.
**Speaker 1**: Shouldn't it be attached, you say, and pull it up on actual.
**Jdawson**: I usually go in and look at.
**Jdawson**: It's a little easier back there.
**Jdawson**: See, there's where.
**Jdawson**: You know, and that's where.
**Jdawson**: When I looked at it, like, I knew he had a problem.
**Jdawson**: So he artificially added in what his fee is, but there's a problem in his budget because it's still 679.
**Jdawson**: 389.
**Jdawson**: Not 685.
**Jdawson**: 977.
**Jdawson**: What do you look at?
**Jdawson**: The job planner.
**Jdawson**: Go down to fee.
**Speaker 1**: Mm.
**Jdawson**: And what on that job planner.
**Jdawson**: If you go back to that.
**Jdawson**: I don't know why, but go click on the budget code.
**Jdawson**: See that thing?
**Jdawson**: Go over.
**Speaker 1**: Which one?
**Jdawson**: Go over to the left a little bit.
**Jdawson**: Just click in that area and then it lines up the budget codes correctly.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I know.
**Speaker 1**: I.
**Speaker 1**: You have to do that every time.
**Speaker 1**: So, like.
**Jdawson**: No, but if you scroll to the bottom, all the way to the bottom.
**Jdawson**: Contractor fee.
**Jdawson**: Oh.
**Speaker 1**: It's still 679.
**Jdawson**: Because all that money is up in different budget codes.
**Speaker 1**: It's not directly going to this code.
**Jdawson**: Nope.
**Jdawson**: So all these change orders.
**Jdawson**: Now he's got to go in each line item that a sub had a change, that money went into their line Item and subtract 10%, 1.25%.
**Speaker 1**: That's annoying.
**Jdawson**: It's a giant clusterfuck.
**Jdawson**: So you imagine if you send a change order to 10 different subs, you're going to be doing 20 budget modifications.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, we don't want that.
**Speaker 1**: Can.
**Speaker 1**: Can we change it?
**Jdawson**: Change it?
**Jdawson**: I told them to fix it.
**Jdawson**: I said we would never in any universe not do that on every contract.
**Speaker 1**: So is this one.
**Speaker 1**: Is this.
**Jdawson**: So they wrote two contracts because they split the building up.
**Jdawson**: The volleyball now is owned by Katie.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And the other, the Mbev or whoever, they own the food court area.
**Jdawson**: So that's a little confusing with how they set it up.
**Jdawson**: He said it works.
**Jdawson**: There's one budget with two contracts.
**Jdawson**: So that.
**Speaker 1**: That makes sense.
**Speaker 1**: It's in there now.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: At first they said they couldn't change it.
**Jdawson**: I don't know if they went in and fixed it, but.
**Jdawson**: And with this as it doesn't let once a contract's executed.
**Jdawson**: You can't change any of that or if you wrote a change order I think maybe it's when you write up your first change order then it's too late to change that.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: But anyway so that's one thing you would review each time is the contractor fee.
**Jdawson**: They show match what's in the budget.
**Jdawson**: And he says his current insurance is 82,000.
**Jdawson**: Well that's.
**Speaker 1**: That's what I was going to say.
**Speaker 1**: The first thing I noticed is the contract amount increased but our insurance didn't again.
**Jdawson**: So he tried to.
**Jdawson**: I don't know if he projected all of the change order fee and insurance into fee but that 82,251 is what the budget says.
**Jdawson**: So maybe he just fixed.
**Jdawson**: I don't know if he tried to fixing.
**Jdawson**: I don't know what he did but so that has to get fixed his current unallocated cost and that's why I don't know it's 73 029.
**Jdawson**: But if he's moving money out of budget lines thinking it's extra but it's really our fee and insurance then he's moving again into the wrong line.
**Jdawson**: It should go into fee and insurance not unallocated cost.
**Jdawson**: So you need check on that.
**Jdawson**: Current owner contingency says 127 296.63 and his report says it's 131,601.
**Jdawson**: So that doesn't reflect a $4,000.
**Speaker 1**: I wish you could.
**Speaker 1**: There's a way to see bar perimeter.
**Speaker 1**: So he's got a note on what.
**Jdawson**: It was for here.
**Speaker 1**: It's just not showing up.
**Speaker 1**: Maybe that happened after the June date.
**Jdawson**: Well you shouldn't be using a budget modifications to move that anyways.
**Jdawson**: Like contingency should be a change.
**Jdawson**: Contingency has to be a change order and it'll show.
**Speaker 1**: It'll show as a zero dollar change order but the money will move.
**Jdawson**: Well practically it's like if you have a change order you have the subs cost and then you have a line that has a negative amount from the contingency code and then it makes it zero but then it moves the money automatically in there for you and there's a record of it like this.
**Jdawson**: I mean that's not the way to take contingency out.
**Jdawson**: So he needs to fix that.
**Speaker 1**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: Like if you go into the the change orders like is there any change order that mentions.
**Speaker 1**: What am I missing here?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, there's a plan revision fees for 123.
**Jdawson**: That's not it.
**Speaker 1**: I'm not seeing it.
**Jdawson**: Or 304.
**Jdawson**: There it is.
**Jdawson**: It's PCCR.
**Jdawson**: Open that one up.
**Jdawson**: Foundation perimeter.
**Speaker 1**: So he issued it to Merit and.
**Jdawson**: He didn't put two lines.
**Jdawson**: So if he had put two lines in there, it would move that money correctly, Right?
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, that makes sense.
**Jdawson**: So that's something else needs to get fixed.
**Jdawson**: Then we have remaining buyout.
**Jdawson**: So if you go back to his budget.
**Jdawson**: So, yes, calculator out if you wanted.
**Jdawson**: But if we go through here.
**Jdawson**: Vision 2.
**Jdawson**: Commitments are written for everything.
**Jdawson**: And you're.
**Speaker 1**: You're seeing that, but you're seeing that by looking at.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, if you look at the Commitments column, your projected of the Commitments column, if there's a commitment wrote to that, then it's.
**Jdawson**: It shows up what that commitment is in there.
**Jdawson**: So concrete revised budgets.
**Jdawson**: 524, 16.
**Jdawson**: He's got a commitment of 486.
**Jdawson**: So there's $34,000 extra in that budget.
**Jdawson**: Line item.
**Jdawson**: Is that because he still has to write a contract for something?
**Jdawson**: He hasn't bought something out.
**Jdawson**: Because if he's done and he's bought it out and he doesn't have any, or if you say, listen, I'm not sure, but I think I'm gonna have to do this or that.
**Jdawson**: So that's where that money is.
**Jdawson**: So it's either an unallocated cost that should be.
**Jdawson**: Or he needs to buy something else out.
**Speaker 1**: So that would either.
**Jdawson**: That would live here, that would enter more or.
**Speaker 1**: Or up here, one of the two.
**Jdawson**: It needs to be in one or the other.
**Jdawson**: If there's money out here.
**Jdawson**: And forecast to complete in a subcontractor code.
**Jdawson**: So masonry that commitments for all of those.
**Jdawson**: No forecast to complete metals.
**Jdawson**: There's 10,000 left in that.
**Jdawson**: Not sure what that's for.
**Jdawson**: Metal stairs.
**Jdawson**: That's got 4800 possibly.
**Jdawson**: I don't know what else is left to buy out there.
**Jdawson**: Decorative metal has some extra money.
**Jdawson**: Finished carpentry isn't bought out yet.
**Jdawson**: We know that.
**Jdawson**: There's no commitments written.
**Jdawson**: Looks like your ethis is bought out.
**Jdawson**: Fire stopping is a plug.
**Jdawson**: And so that's something I would expect to be just left open because who knows what.
**Jdawson**: We got a fire car or if we do elemental doors and frames.
**Jdawson**: Got that bought out.
**Jdawson**: The storefront isn't bought out.
**Jdawson**: Aluminum frames.
**Jdawson**: My budget's gone.
**Jdawson**: Overhead doors are good.
**Jdawson**: There's the storefront that's bought out.
**Jdawson**: So here's the framer.
**Jdawson**: He's supposed to get that bought out from Superior today.
**Jdawson**: So that's Open.
**Jdawson**: I'm gonna just add some of this up as we go through it.
**Jdawson**: You look at the other ones.
**Jdawson**: You tell me what you see.
**Jdawson**: Sorry.
**Speaker 1**: Kanden's texting to me out in Dallas.
**Speaker 1**: We were dealing with train issues all day Saturday.
**Speaker 1**: Where were we at if is good.
**Speaker 1**: You said fire stopping was a plug.
**Jdawson**: Number, I would imagine.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Speaker 1**: Openings.
**Speaker 1**: That's something there.
**Speaker 1**: Haven't bought the doors yet.
**Jdawson**: He's got the metal doors and he's got storefront.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, but this is all.
**Speaker 1**: I'm assuming this is all of our interior doors.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: What's.
**Jdawson**: Well, there's no commitment.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: For doors yet.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So that would be a part of that remaining buyout.
**Speaker 1**: Aluminum frames, no commitments there.
**Speaker 1**: Overhead doors.
**Jdawson**: Storefronts.
**Jdawson**: None of the specialties are bought out.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Speaker 1**: Still has all of his framing.
**Speaker 1**: Vision 9.
**Speaker 1**: Stills gotta be bought out.
**Jdawson**: Nothing.
**Jdawson**: Vision 10.
**Jdawson**: His casework isn't bought out yet.
**Speaker 1**: I buy his Knoxbox.
**Jdawson**: H vac.
**Speaker 1**: There's no elevator on this, is there?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, it's done.
**Jdawson**: That was the first thing we did.
**Speaker 1**: There is?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Landscaping's done.
**Speaker 1**: So I have 492 you cut out on there.
**Speaker 1**: Is there an elevator you cut out on there?
**Speaker 1**: Is there?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Division 14.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Elevators, conveying equipment.
**Speaker 1**: Well, I just didn't know.
**Speaker 1**: I thought they went away with it, but.
**Jdawson**: So when I add all the projected costs up, it comes to 892, 757.
**Jdawson**: So either ease.
**Jdawson**: He's got.
**Speaker 1**: You mean forecast to complete.
**Jdawson**: On the forecast to complete.
**Jdawson**: So either has more to buy out or he's got a bunch of internal.
**Jdawson**: He's got 70,000 in internal contingency still, and that's not a bad thing.
**Jdawson**: And I told him, never show everything in the beginning because you always want your unallocated cost to creep upward to the end of the job.
**Jdawson**: So it's not a bad thing.
**Jdawson**: That's just a question you would ask them.
**Jdawson**: Like you really have 821 left to buy out or do you have 892,000 to buy out?
**Jdawson**: Because if you do have 892 to buy out, then.
**Speaker 1**: Well, like I'm seeing this number down here.
**Speaker 1**: We have 961.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, that's contracted.
**Speaker 1**: I've got 2 million.
**Jdawson**: I know what that puts our fee and the architects fees and the contractor fee, like all of those come into that.
**Speaker 1**: Well, still, you know, let's say that that's a million.
**Speaker 1**: We're still at almost a million here.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, it's got our GCS in there too.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So all you would do you just want to go through the sub codes?
**Jdawson**: That's where your remaining buyout is going to be.
**Jdawson**: Unless it's like your cleaner, which in division one, general condition.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Jdawson**: So then he's got his projected profit which is different than the budget in job planner.
**Jdawson**: So that's another thing thick the fix.
**Speaker 1**: Well, shouldn't this be current projected profit?
**Speaker 1**: Shouldn't it be this plus unallocated cost?
**Jdawson**: No, that's because the unallocated cost isn't profit until the end of the job.
**Speaker 1**: So don't add those up until the end.
**Jdawson**: Nope, never.
**Jdawson**: Because I mean that's where people, if they manage a job right.
**Jdawson**: And the end of the job and that profit, you know, then when you know their bonuses and their performances, like that's where we can see how they do at the end of the job.
**Jdawson**: You know what did they actually increase it to.
**Speaker 1**: 67 open submittals.
**Speaker 1**: Damn.
**Jdawson**: So if you look and go to the submittal tab in here.
**Jdawson**: So he's got conveying system shown as submitted.
**Jdawson**: But like it's elevator finishes.
**Jdawson**: He's.
**Jdawson**: We told him to just be standard, but masonry not submitted.
**Jdawson**: Bike cracks, all the specialties.
**Jdawson**: He doesn't have contracts for H Vac.
**Jdawson**: That's concerning because they've been signed up.
**Jdawson**: Doors and windows, that's all been signed up.
**Jdawson**: Electrical nothing.
**Jdawson**: Plumbing nothing.
**Jdawson**: You know, it's due date.
**Jdawson**: Like all these are past a month almost now.
**Jdawson**: So that's a problem.
**Jdawson**: And I don't know what this means.
**Jdawson**: Closed icons, exterior improvements is closed.
**Jdawson**: Mean it's been closed.
**Speaker 1**: Would mean it's, you know, complete I would hope because the ad periods are already in.
**Jdawson**: Closed approved.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so let's see, what do we got here?
**Jdawson**: One filter this week we can filter new.
**Speaker 1**: See anything here?
**Jdawson**: We got 45 that haven't been submitted.
**Speaker 1**: Where are you seeing that number at, Jesse?
**Jdawson**: I just counted them up.
**Speaker 1**: Just that where it says new.
**Speaker 1**: Here all the ones that say new.
**Jdawson**: Well, new or submitted you can filter at the top of the screen.
**Jdawson**: And he's got three submitted, so he's only got 48 open submittals.
**Jdawson**: So he's saying 67.
**Jdawson**: But unless he's, you know, if his submittal log was set up correctly in the beginning to list everything he needs, then he's almost 20 better than he shows there.
**Jdawson**: And he went from 57 last month to 67 this month.
**Jdawson**: So I would, I would just.
**Jdawson**: You have to ask him what's going on here.
**Jdawson**: Doesn't make sense.
**Jdawson**: And the fact is sub billing, total month ending was 259job to date cost.
**Jdawson**: So if you go back to the budget here.
**Jdawson**: Direct cost.
**Speaker 1**: So I'm reading this as we're still owed 1.4 million on this project.
**Jdawson**: So we show actual amount of committed invoice.
**Jdawson**: Commitment.
**Jdawson**: Committed invoiced amount 721 invoiced.
**Jdawson**: And then all of our other direct costs and fee bill is 986.
**Speaker 1**: Can you view that by going to invoicing?
**Jdawson**: No, I look.
**Jdawson**: You look at the budget and it's got your line.
**Jdawson**: If you go all the way to the left.
**Speaker 1**: I got commitments.
**Jdawson**: And then you drop down to the bottom.
**Jdawson**: Let's go further to the left.
**Jdawson**: Scroll left.
**Jdawson**: Think you need to hit that little box at the top.
**Jdawson**: And what box?
**Jdawson**: Make it line up correctly.
**Jdawson**: The budget codes.
**Jdawson**: They're out of whack.
**Jdawson**: You know got.
**Speaker 1**: I got them.
**Speaker 1**: They're here 31.
**Jdawson**: So does it put the fee at the bottom?
**Jdawson**: That's what I'm saying.
**Jdawson**: If you hit.
**Jdawson**: But that budget code box Y.
**Jdawson**: There we go.
**Jdawson**: Scroll to the left.
**Speaker 1**: What am I missing here?
**Jdawson**: Are you scrolling?
**Speaker 1**: Invoice amount 721.
**Speaker 1**: Is this what you were looking at?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So if you scroll.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So if you look there like we build.
**Jdawson**: So we build.
**Speaker 1**: I don't have anything in here.
**Speaker 1**: And receive receivable invoices.
**Jdawson**: Show all.
**Jdawson**: There we go.
**Jdawson**: If you go to contract and then you looked at the.
**Jdawson**: See where is that?
**Speaker 1**: Come here.
**Speaker 1**: Invoices.
**Jdawson**: Invoices.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So these are all Those billings today.
**Jdawson**: 1148 416.
**Jdawson**: Those numbers a little different for some reason.
**Speaker 1**: Well it would be this for that contract and then he probably build for this one.
**Speaker 1**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: Well but it's not.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Speaker 1**: 202648.
**Jdawson**: But that doesn't add up to 14 23.
**Speaker 1**: Tell you here in just a second.
**Speaker 1**: Plus 11484167 8.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, you're right.
**Speaker 1**: That's 1 million 3.
**Speaker 1**: 1.351.
**Speaker 1**: He's showing 1 million 423.
**Jdawson**: He doesn't have any owner payments.
**Jdawson**: So we don't know like if we paid how much have we been paid?
**Jdawson**: That needs to be filled out and job to date cost.
**Jdawson**: So this obviously this is several weeks old.
**Jdawson**: But we're showing our job to date cost is 986,241.
**Jdawson**: And you see this up right at the bottom left corner.
**Jdawson**: That's like everything like all the billings and stuff, you know our fee, everything else has come into this job948.
**Jdawson**: Now the commitment invoices because that doesn't.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So you got two things coming in here.
**Jdawson**: Like all of our general condition costs don't come up in the committed invoiced amount.
**Speaker 1**: They come to the actual amount.
**Jdawson**: Right?
**Jdawson**: In the actual amount.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: But that also includes what we build for insurance and fee, which.
**Speaker 1**: So we've built 1.3 million and we've paid out 986,000 is how I'm seeing this.
**Jdawson**: Well, there's invoiced amount.
**Jdawson**: So that may be their invoice.
**Jdawson**: We haven't paid yet because of, you know, it's part of the following month's billing.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: For the following month's payment.
**Speaker 1**: And here it is.
**Jdawson**: Gc.
**Speaker 1**: Man, I hate how it does this.
**Speaker 1**: You got to click this every time to get them in the right order.
**Jdawson**: But the job due date cost is.
**Jdawson**: Should be that 986, 241 17.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Minus our fee and insurance.
**Speaker 1**: Well, those shouldn't show.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, those aren't showing up over here.
**Jdawson**: They do.
**Jdawson**: So we've the actual amount.
**Speaker 1**: I think the actual amount is just cost hitting it.
**Jdawson**: Oh, yeah.
**Jdawson**: It's not showing any.
**Jdawson**: So, yeah, that's actually the insurance is not in that.
**Jdawson**: So our actual cost today is 986, 241 17.
**Jdawson**: So when you think of how much we build for fee and insurance so far, you know, we're just.
**Jdawson**: We're not ahead hardly at all on this job in billing.
**Jdawson**: It's not the end of the world.
**Jdawson**: But Brandon likes to be overbilled.
**Speaker 1**: We'll see.
**Speaker 1**: So where am I missing this?
**Speaker 1**: Because to me, I see this as over, overbuilt.
**Speaker 1**: If we have.
**Speaker 1**: If we have this much, it is a little overbuilt.
**Speaker 1**: If we have this much fee and insurance, you know, to me that's.
**Speaker 1**: Hopefully we build for all of our insurance.
**Speaker 1**: Always build your insurance at the beginning, but, you know.
**Speaker 1**: So let's say that's seven.
**Speaker 1**: Would that be 760.
**Speaker 1**: 760,000.
**Speaker 1**: And if we're at 1.3, we've only got 986 in cost me.
**Speaker 1**: That's 400,000.
**Speaker 1**: We only have 400 more grand to go on it.
**Speaker 1**: That's rough math, but still.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, but so the job today cost, like that's not right.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: So maybe I didn't explain that.
**Jdawson**: But the job today cost should be all of our GCs.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Should be subs, Billings.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: The nine.
**Jdawson**: Well, yeah, see here though.
**Jdawson**: But that doesn't.
**Jdawson**: It does.
**Jdawson**: It does.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: So, yeah, that's it.
**Jdawson**: So I Know, like I said, this is in the middle of a month after this report was done two weeks ago.
**Jdawson**: So I don't know if that changed.
**Jdawson**: But when he did a snapshot.
**Jdawson**: Well we do know.
**Jdawson**: Look at the budget he printed out for this thing.
**Jdawson**: It's part of the report.
**Jdawson**: That's why it's important to do a PDF report.
**Speaker 1**: Scroll down here to actual amount.
**Speaker 1**: See that's.
**Speaker 1**: He didn't extend it.
**Jdawson**: What is that 411 in the one column you can see this is now 721.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, so maybe it was that back then.
**Jdawson**: I don't know.
**Speaker 1**: Subs just.
**Speaker 1**: We'll probably have to just wait until end of the month to see it, you know.
**Jdawson**: So that's pretty much in a nutshell.
**Jdawson**: Like I don't know if you can see, like if you just check off these things and look at what's in job planner, you can basically understand like we know he's got a problem with submittals.
**Jdawson**: You know, we got a problem with buyout and I know they had to finish drawings that were done later.
**Jdawson**: So you know, they didn't, you know, they're just now maybe able to do the finishes, you know, with the interior designer.
**Jdawson**: But you know, we got a problem with the fee and insurance, we got a problem with the change order for the contingency.
**Jdawson**: And those are things like you can fix them now, but you wait till the end of the job and you got all those things like that.
**Jdawson**: It's, it just becomes a mess.
**Jdawson**: So right, once a month you review it, check in and you have them fix it and then you get a good report.
**Jdawson**: And typically when they fix it once, then it either reminds them not to make the same mistake again or you know, you just get a lot easier report to run through and all the numbers line up.
**Jdawson**: Then you know, everything's good.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Jdawson**: And so Maybe he got 20 more submittals done too.
**Jdawson**: Since that report was done.
**Speaker 1**: He said he's been, he said he's been pounding him out.
**Speaker 1**: So.
**Jdawson**: So here's the, is the twenty thousand dollar bill or two hundred two thousand dollars billing.
**Jdawson**: And where's the other payout?
**Speaker 1**: Right here.
**Jdawson**: Payment 191.
**Jdawson**: 875.
**Jdawson**: What does it say build to date on this one?
**Jdawson**: 1,000,221, 221055.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Plus.
**Speaker 1**: Plus the 202.
**Jdawson**: 202 something.
**Jdawson**: See now that adds up to the 1423703.
**Jdawson**: But why does it, why is that number different?
**Jdawson**: Job planner?
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: I don't know.
**Speaker 1**: Let me Go back and look.
**Jdawson**: Invoices.
**Jdawson**: It's taking retainage out.
**Speaker 1**: On job.
**Jdawson**: Well, it's just showing the retainage instead of the total.
**Jdawson**: The grand total.
**Jdawson**: Well, now, are we getting retained held.
**Jdawson**: Wait, it says.
**Jdawson**: It does say the grand total.
**Jdawson**: 19 or.
**Jdawson**: No, that's the.
**Jdawson**: After retainers is the 191 side report.
**Speaker 1**: Are they holding retainage on us?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, so he's in.
**Speaker 1**: In his.
**Speaker 1**: He's not showing the.
**Speaker 1**: This includes retainage.
**Speaker 1**: That 1423703.
**Jdawson**: And that's fine as long as you understand that because all the subs get held retainage, all that affects us is on our little GCS and whatnot.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: Everything makes sense.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, it makes sense.
**Speaker 1**: I have Keba getting everything inputted for radial wave on and job planner right now.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: See, I sent.
**Jdawson**: So if you want to get with Keva, because he'll have to do PSRs for three jobs at the end of this or, you know, three jobs he needs to set up the first one.
**Speaker 1**: What are we having?
**Speaker 1**: So Kevin's going to be doing radio Avon radio.
**Jdawson**: Avon Radio Martinsville, and he's doing Uniqlo.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So I don't think we have a PSR for any of them.
**Jdawson**: Second.
**Jdawson**: Jason.
**Speaker 1**: Hey, what's up, man?
**Speaker 1**: Okay, can we shut the breaker off at the panel?
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, Go Kelly.
**Speaker 1**: Kelly texted me and she said, see you.
**Speaker 1**: All right, go.
**Speaker 1**: Kelly texted me and said she dropped the ball.
**Speaker 1**: So I'm.
**Speaker 1**: I'm working through it.
**Jdawson**: Sorry.
**Speaker 1**: I was going to call Jesse.
**Speaker 1**: So we're just gonna have to find it on the.
**Speaker 1**: On a breaker and shut it off.
**Speaker 1**: And then if we shut it off at the breaker, then her electrician will then wire it up when we're ready.
**Speaker 1**: Can you hear me?
**Speaker 1**: So if it's shut off at the breaker, then there's no problem disconnecting it, raising it, and then reconnecting.
**Speaker 1**: Is that.
**Speaker 1**: Is that right?
**Speaker 1**: I mean, I don't know where else you would disconnect it at, right?
**Speaker 1**: Are you.
**Speaker 1**: You're talking about the H Vac guy going ahead and disconnecting it?
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: I mean, that's the only place we can disconnect it is from the roof.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: I mean, we have to be.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: There.
**Speaker 1**: Let me.
**Speaker 1**: I'll try and look on the back end for them.
**Speaker 1**: But, I mean, they're going to be.
**Speaker 1**: They.
**Speaker 1**: They will.
**Speaker 1**: They'll be numbered.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Kelly was supposed to.
**Speaker 1**: She.
**Speaker 1**: See if she replied.
**Speaker 1**: She said, here we go.
**Speaker 1**: She said, yes.
**Speaker 1**: Sorry about that.
**Speaker 1**: Totally forgotten.
**Speaker 1**: So I'm gonna share this contact with you.
**Speaker 1**: Okay?
**Speaker 1**: Candon.
**Speaker 1**: I just sent you this Ricardo guy's number.
**Speaker 1**: If you want to give him a call.
**Speaker 1**: Let me know if you can't get a hold of him, okay?
**Speaker 1**: So let me know if you need anything, man.
**Speaker 1**: How's it going?
**Jdawson**: Good.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, Everybody's basically set up, ready to go.
**Speaker 1**: Just they're looking over everything one last time.
**Speaker 1**: I gotta get this power.
**Speaker 1**: All right, man.
**Speaker 1**: I just sent you Ricardo's number.
**Speaker 1**: See you.
