## Transcript
**Lhoran**: Good morning everyone.
**Jdawson**: Good morning.
**Bclymer**: Morning.
**Lhoran**: I know we're just a minute early.
**Tkussow**: So we'll give everyone a couple minutes to join.
**Lhoran**: Okay, I know we're a minute over.
**Lhoran**: AJ Is anyone else joining from your team or is most everyone in the same location with you?
**Jdawson**: No, just me and Jesse.
**Bclymer**: Okay, great.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bwertz**: Good morning everybody.
**Lhoran**: Good morning.
**Lhoran**: I think we're waiting on a couple applied people.
**Lhoran**: So like I said, we'll just give.
**Tkussow**: Them a few minutes to join.
**Lhoran**: I don't believe it looks like Dan and Mark from applied are not joining today.
**Lhoran**: So it looks like it's just Ted and Lauren who are to be joining.
**Bclymer**: From the applied group.
**Mlehman**: Brad W.S.
**Mlehman**: is on the phone.
**Lhoran**: Oh, hi Brad.
**Tkussow**: Good morning.
**Mlehman**: Lauren may be late.
**Mlehman**: He was at and I'm not sure about Ted.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Lhoran**: Are you.
**Lhoran**: Are you okay if we start with Alam or we can.
**Lhoran**: I'm happy to wait a few minutes.
**Lhoran**: Totally up to you.
**Mlehman**: Probably just stay on time if you want to just get going.
**Tkussow**: Okay, sounds great.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Lhoran**: So I am sharing my screen.
**Lhoran**: The goal today is we're going to do a page turn of the construction documents that were sent to you on 3 31.
**Lhoran**: We will capture all revisions and issue a construction set out to you.
**Lhoran**: These have been submitted to state for permitting.
**Lhoran**: So AJ has been in the loop on that and has the number for their reference and he will be handling the city.
**Lhoran**: And then we're also going to be reviewing the finishes that were dropped off today by Emma.
**Lhoran**: I have a digital design development presentation to share and I can also send you that at the end of the meeting with any revisions or follow ups from that.
**Lhoran**: So depending on the length of revisions.
**Tkussow**: Oh, there's Lauren.
**Tkussow**: I'll admit him and then I can't say those things again.
**Lhoran**: Good morning, Lauren.
**Bwertz**: Hello.
**Bwertz**: Hello.
**Lhoran**: I was just telling the group our our goals for today's meeting.
**Lhoran**: And the agenda is.
**Lhoran**: Let's see who else from your team was joining.
**Lhoran**: Possibly Ted.
**Lhoran**: Do you want us to wait for.
**Tkussow**: Him, Lauren, or go ahead and get started?
**Bwertz**: I'm not sure there should be somebody in the conference room.
**Bwertz**: So Brad, I think you said you're in the conference rooms.
**Bwertz**: Was Ted in the office today or is he out and about?
**Mlehman**: He had his headset on earlier so he might be in a call.
**Mlehman**: So we'll just think it's just gonna be you and I.
**Bwertz**: Okay.
**Bwertz**: Looks like I should probably hop on my computer.
**Bwertz**: So keep talking.
**Bwertz**: I'm in my car, but I'll fire up my computer real quick so I can follow along on the.
**Bwertz**: On the screen.
**Bwertz**: So no Again, I apologize.
**Bwertz**: I was on vacation last week and I thought Dan had today open, so that's why I picked it.
**Bwertz**: It looked like the majority of principals were open, but he's out on vacation and.
**Bwertz**: And I have not had time to review the documents.
**Bwertz**: So I do apologize and look at this for from blind.
**Bwertz**: But I mean that's a good thing.
**Bwertz**: You can walk me through and tell me the story.
**Tkussow**: Well, that's.
**Tkussow**: I.
**Tkussow**: And I agree.
**Lhoran**: I think some fresh eyes would be good.
**Lhoran**: So you're going to see some of this for the first time, which is totally fine.
**Lhoran**: So I was telling the group the goal of today's meeting is we're going to conduct a page turn of the documents that were sent to you on 3 31, capture all those revisions and issue a construction set out to the Alito group.
**Lhoran**: These were already permitted, so the permit set was sent into the state so that we can hopefully in the.
**Lhoran**: In the week it's taken, you know, for us to get the review set up, we are going to hopefully capture that time at the state permitting and then at the time that those are released by the state, then AJ can go ahead and get those into the city.
**Lhoran**: We're also going to be reviewing the design development package, the digital version, and Emma dropped off most of the finishes to you today that we could get on time for the meeting.
**Lhoran**: All others we can send to you at a later date.
**Lhoran**: So we'll review that as well if time allows.
**Lhoran**: And then any revisions that we have, we'll go ahead and get those captured here by the end of the week.
**Tkussow**: And like I said, issue that construction set so the Alito group can get going.
**Lhoran**: If there's anything else that we need to discuss today, we'll make the time for it or we can set up a future meeting or if Dan or Merck have questions and need a review or like I said, at a later.
**Tkussow**: Date, we can do that as well.
**Lhoran**: Okay, we're going to go ahead and get started.
**Lhoran**: So some of these pages I'm going to skip over just because they're just a part of having in our construction documents for permitting.
**Lhoran**: So we have our cover sheet which has some general construction information, our accessibility sheet for some ADA compliancy and rules and regulations for construction.
**Lhoran**: We have our wall types which a couple of these I can reference us back to as we get onto our floor plan, our life safety plan.
**Lhoran**: Again, this is for state permitting to.
**Tkussow**: Show exiting through your space and your new expansion.
**Lhoran**: And then we'll start on our demo page here.
**Lhoran**: So I'M going to try to split this view so that everyone can see the keynotes and then see the drawings for reference.
**Lhoran**: I know these are big pages sometimes if you are on a laptop on a small screen.
**Lhoran**: So I'm going to do my best not to give anyone motion sickness as.
**Tkussow**: I zoom around here on the pages.
**Lhoran**: So your demo plan consists of everything that's going to be removed from that expansion suite.
**Lhoran**: So a lot of this is casework.
**Lhoran**: So for Keynote 1, which you see here at the top of your screen and then highlighted in several places across the plan, are noting to remove any existing casework and cap any plumbing, if any existing as required.
**Lhoran**: And then if any of those walls are going to stay, none of them do, but they just accept this, you know, corridor wall here.
**Lhoran**: They're just going to patch and make.
**Tkussow**: That ready for new construction.
**Lhoran**: Keynote two is saying that the existing base cabinets in your space in your break room, so that keynote's here, all of those are going to remain along with the appliances.
**Lhoran**: They're going to clean and repair as required to make like new.
**Lhoran**: And then they're going to remove that existing counter and prep again for a new counter in that same location.
**Lhoran**: So the intent is for the new to match that existing size in relation to that new countertop.
**Lhoran**: We are going to do a new sink that is Keynote 3.
**Lhoran**: So they're going to remove the existing sink.
**Lhoran**: And then I have highlighted here we had a note for garbage disposal.
**Lhoran**: Is that existing or do you have one in your space now?
**Lhoran**: Because if so, we'll go back with.
**Tkussow**: A new garbage disposal as well.
**Bwertz**: We have an existing one.
**Lhoran**: Okay, so we're going to ask them to remove that existing sink and garbage disposal and prep for new in that exact same location.
**Lhoran**: And so I'll show you on the floor plan and I have the image.
**Tkussow**: Of the sink pulled up what that will look like.
**Lhoran**: Okay.
**Lhoran**: Keynote 4 Is that a lot of your existing finishes are to remain.
**Lhoran**: So because we're kind of bleeding into some of your existing, you know, space on this side.
**Lhoran**: That's just noting that anything that's kind of outside of our demo scope, all of those finishes need to remain so.
**Tkussow**: That we are being cohesive with what's going back.
**Lhoran**: Your Keynote 5 is for existing casework in the this coat room up front here to remain that we actually already had plan on the space plan.
**Lhoran**: It worked out that the existing is.
**Tkussow**: There, so we're going to ask them to keep that.
**Lhoran**: And then your Keynote 6 for your demo plan, get a new color here.
**Lhoran**: Is that all Existing plotter equipment and furniture kind of located in this area on your plan is to remain.
**Lhoran**: If that has changed since we've last spoke, I know kind of that and the library locations were kind of up for discussion.
**Lhoran**: If that's changed, we can change it on the plan, but we just want to make sure that they're protecting that equipment.
**Lhoran**: There's not any kind of demo or anything going over there, but we just.
**Tkussow**: Want to make sure that that's going to remain.
**Tkussow**: Okay.
**Lhoran**: Any questions on demo?
**Lhoran**: All right, moving on to your demo rcp.
**Lhoran**: Not many keynotes here because the demo plan is pretty self explanatory for the goal and what we're trying to achieve.
**Lhoran**: So upon our field verification, we're showing anything, everything that's going to be removed and then we'll show on your new RCP what's going back with new finishes.
**Lhoran**: I think as I mentioned before when we were kind of going through the pricing guideline and just where your role lies and your, your preference on the MEP system.
**Lhoran**: Our drawings are pretty general in nature.
**Tkussow**: And we'll, we'll talk about that when.
**Lhoran**: We get to the RCP and where.
**Tkussow**: You all can fit in with the Alito group on, on that construction.
**Lhoran**: So all of this is going to be coming out to work with your new layout again, which I'll show you.
**Tkussow**: On your RCP plan.
**Lhoran**: Okay, so moving to your floor plan here, I'll go through, like I said, the keynotes again and then we can talk about any questions that the group has.
**Lhoran**: But please feel free to stop me in the meantime if you have any questions.
**Lhoran**: Keynote one is to provide a new fire reset semi recessed fire extinguisher and these two locations I've highlighted on your plan, one of them is already existing and then our new one that we have located on the right side here, this is the best location for being out of the way and being out of the way of furniture and everything like that.
**Tkussow**: So it's kind of on this back reception wall and that's Keynote 1.
**Lhoran**: Keynote 2 is to provide blocking for your wall mounted TV that's going to be in your large conference room.
**Lhoran**: Did you have any other locations where you needed blocking?
**Lhoran**: I do have for Keynote 7 that.
**Tkussow**: I need to move these down here.
**Lhoran**: That your signage, if you have a location for that and if that needs blocking, we can add a keynote for that and we can kind of discuss where you plan to put that as we go along.
**Lhoran**: But any other TV locations or blocking requirements that we should be aware of.
**Bwertz**: Besides the cabinets I don't think so.
**Bwertz**: For the fire extinguisher location.
**Bwertz**: And again I remember there being discussion of that wall where you got that shown almost a half wall, full wall or get rid of the wall.
**Bwertz**: Can that extinguisher just slide to the south and kind of in that niche?
**Bwertz**: Yeah, exactly.
**Lhoran**: Absolutely.
**Lhoran**: Yep, we can do that.
**Lhoran**: And maybe it's that we're putting it on this wall.
**Bwertz**: Yep, that's where I'd put it at.
**Bwertz**: Just because I assume again we may end up rounding that wall off if we end up not putting that wall in at all.
**Bwertz**: So sure.
**Lhoran**: Yep.
**Lhoran**: Absolutely.
**Lhoran**: And let us know where you land on that or if that's something that's decided with the Alito group in the field.
**Lhoran**: And we can adjust anything accordingly.
**Lhoran**: But as we go through the plan, there shouldn't be anything that hinders that that wall from either existing being a.
**Tkussow**: Half wall or a full height wall.
**Lhoran**: Okay.
**Lhoran**: So Keynote 3 is to provide new plastic laminate countertop.
**Lhoran**: This is in your break room.
**Lhoran**: And then I will show you those finishes on the design development when we get to there.
**Lhoran**: This is, we have a note.
**Lhoran**: So we followed the design the pricing guideline package that we had did previously with you all in the note that talks about having new backsplash above your countertop.
**Lhoran**: We felt like that was a good addition with keeping the existing casework.
**Lhoran**: And then since you are putting new counter that's a good time to do that.
**Lhoran**: So again we'll, we'll talk about those.
**Lhoran**: So your plastic laminate countertop is going to have no side or backsplash.
**Lhoran**: It's going to have that, that wall tile in that location.
**Lhoran**: So we'll, we'll talk about that when.
**Tkussow**: We get to the design development as well.
**Lhoran**: So you do have an under counter refrigerator which is Keynote 4.
**Lhoran**: So that's just calling out to the contractor that you do have a new appliance location in your conference room and we will show power for that on.
**Tkussow**: Your power and data plan.
**Lhoran**: Keynote 5 and this is a location and if you need this is up for discussion during for this area in your new storage room kind of loaded located on the back of your reception desk here we have along this bottom wall for the contractor to provide new 18 inch deep heavy duty adjustable white melamine shelves on KV standards and brackets so that you can adj asking for five shelves per closet.
**Lhoran**: Is that something that you all need in this area?
**Lhoran**: Would that be helpful to you or.
**Tkussow**: Do you have other plans for this storage room?
**Bwertz**: I think it'd be helpful.
**Bwertz**: I mean we're losing that once.
**Bwertz**: Well, I guess that's a good question.
**Bwertz**: I don't even know if we need shelving.
**Bwertz**: I guess we haven't thought about what needs to go there.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bwertz**: Today there's a cart.
**Bwertz**: You know the shelf.
**Bwertz**: Sorry, the storage room we have now that sits behind reception has a cart and has packing package supplies in there.
**Bwertz**: And there's kind of one shelf that they use.
**Bwertz**: But I don't know if we need all the shelving at the moment.
**Bwertz**: But I'll let Brad or Ted chime in if I'm missing something.
**Bwertz**: What do we do with this?
**Mlehman**: The old storage room.
**Bwertz**: It just took down the one that's behind reception?
**Mlehman**: No, the one Brad rees in.
**Bwertz**: Oh, well, then, yeah, we've got.
**Bwertz**: I guess we have shelving for that ourselves.
**Bwertz**: We don't.
**Bwertz**: We wouldn't need additional shelving built in.
**Tkussow**: Okay, we can remove that.
**Mlehman**: I mean, did we get rid of them or do we put them somewhere?
**Mlehman**: I haven't noticed.
**Bwertz**: Brad did not get rid of them.
**Bwertz**: He's hanging on to him.
**Bwertz**: Yeah, the.
**Bwertz**: The storage racks.
**Bwertz**: He still has them somewhere.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Lhoran**: Okay, that's no problem.
**Lhoran**: We have it in there just as kind of our standard when we see those storage rooms.
**Lhoran**: So we can go ahead and remove.
**Tkussow**: That from our plan here.
**Lhoran**: So do you need blocking then for that new shelf that you're bringing in or is that freestanding?
**Bwertz**: It's freestanding.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay, sounds good.
**Lhoran**: Okay.
**Lhoran**: Our Keynote 6, which is located in your break room, is to provide, as we talked about before, a new sink and garbage disposal and faucet in this location.
**Lhoran**: Those specs are noted on your keynote here.
**Lhoran**: But I went ahead and I pulled up those specifications so you can see them.
**Lhoran**: This is a.
**Lhoran**: This is our sync spec.
**Lhoran**: We'll change this to a surface mounted since you are going back with plastic laminate countertop here.
**Lhoran**: So it would be a single basin large.
**Lhoran**: This is just a pretty standard 25 inch wide, 18 inch deep, 9 inch deep ball, depending on what you have now.
**Lhoran**: If you're used to having a split bowl, we can do that.
**Lhoran**: We've just seen clients lean a little bit more towards this direction.
**Lhoran**: As far as new sinks.
**Lhoran**: Any preference there?
**Bwertz**: We just have one sink now.
**Bwertz**: I haven't heard anybody complain.
**Bwertz**: I think the holes in the center, it'd be again, I'm picturing they're just going to pull out the old garbage holes and put a new one in just so they're not having to rework all the piping underneath the sink.
**Bwertz**: It'd be ideal if it could land in the same location.
**Lhoran**: Sure.
**Lhoran**: Okay, we can adjust that.
**Lhoran**: I'll make that note after I review the faucet with you.
**Lhoran**: This is the faucet spec.
**Lhoran**: It is a Moen faucet with a pull down handle and adjustable spray kitchen faucet.
**Lhoran**: It's just our standard high kitchen arch and we have it in the stainless steel finish.
**Bclymer**: Any objections there?
**Bwertz**: Yeah, no questions.
**Bwertz**: Seems to match what we have, which is fine.
**Bwertz**: Yep.
**Lhoran**: Okay, so we'll have a note here.
**Lhoran**: We'll do drop down or land with.
**Bclymer**: Center.
**Jdawson**: And Brad and Lauren, real quick, a couple of these items.
**Jdawson**: We're gonna have to adjust our pricing like we didn't include for a new sink.
**Jdawson**: It's not going to change it a ton.
**Jdawson**: And we do have that $50,000 contingency built in.
**Jdawson**: But just keep that in mind.
**Jdawson**: I'm making a little list.
**Jdawson**: I already have it.
**Jdawson**: And I'll, I'll shoot that off to you guys when we're done here.
**Lhoran**: Anybody who goes, go ahead.
**Bwertz**: Yeah, A.J.
**Bwertz**: if you can send us a list of those items that you didn't include.
**Bwertz**: Let it just be nice for us to know again, if the plan was, if your thought was to reuse the bowl, then maybe we just figure out what the cost is.
**Bwertz**: Same thing with, with the backsplash.
**Bwertz**: When I, when I heard that again, didn't dive into it, I was going we're really doing tile backsplash back here.
**Bwertz**: But I don't know if that was included or not.
**Bwertz**: So just, yeah, keep.
**Bwertz**: Give us a list that'd be good for us to review.
**Jdawson**: Yep, I will.
**Jdawson**: I'll shoot it in a follow up email after this.
**Lhoran**: And if any of these things you decide to do a ve option for those or to remove, just let us know.
**Lhoran**: Again, we're following kind of.
**Lhoran**: I know we had some ve that was done after the fact and some plan changes.
**Lhoran**: We were just following the pricing guideline that was sent previously if that was the document that pricing was taken from.
**Tkussow**: So just totally let us know how we can revise these for you.
**Lhoran**: Okay.
**Lhoran**: And then Keynote 7 is tenant provided shelving unit.
**Lhoran**: So this is in your mail and copy that mail location that's shown here.
**Lhoran**: So if that fits the needs for applied and if that's something that they can provide, since it is that kind of that that mail unit, that's what.
**Tkussow**: We have noted for for them to coordinate with the Alito group.
**Bwertz**: Yep, that's fine.
**Bwertz**: We've got it in.
**Bwertz**: Now we just need to store it someplace and then pop it in there when we're ready.
**Bclymer**: Great.
**Lhoran**: And then signage location.
**Lhoran**: So from existing pictures, it looks like it's kind of standoff or adhesive letters to the wall.
**Lhoran**: That typically doesn't require any blocking in the wall.
**Lhoran**: But if you plan for something greater than that in your reception area, of course we can note it.
**Lhoran**: Now, I was assuming that your signage would probably go on this wall just for visibility.
**Lhoran**: As you're looking through the door with your reception desk.
**Lhoran**: Is there a different location you'd like that or something we can note for you if needed?
**Bwertz**: I'm good with that.
**Bwertz**: Unless Ted or Brad having a common space.
**Bwertz**: That was kind of my thoughts back behind it.
**Bwertz**: Just make sure.
**Bwertz**: And I didn't measure it.
**Bwertz**: I just want to make sure that door doesn't swing into it.
**Bwertz**: If it does, we probably just need to move the door a little further south.
**Dmiles**: Yeah, it looks good to me where it is there where you're suggesting it.
**Bclymer**: Okay, great.
**Lhoran**: If you want to let us know that existing sign size.
**Lhoran**: If you're reusing existing, we can drop.
**Tkussow**: That in and show you for reference what that would look like your peak area.
**Mlehman**: What just for scale, is that about five, six there?
**Bclymer**: Let's measure.
**Lhoran**: So you have over eight feet, and I'm not really measuring from corner to corner.
**Lhoran**: Thinking if you kind of center it, you can either center it on the opening, or if you want to center it where the door won't interfere with it, you have about 8ft, 7 inches.
**Tkussow**: Less or minus.
**Lhoran**: And our scales at an eighth of an inch.
**Mlehman**: So it looks like.
**Mlehman**: It looks like it's about six feet, maybe.
**Tkussow**: Okay, great.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Lhoran**: All right.
**Lhoran**: So we won't note any blocking for that then.
**Tkussow**: We just wanted to make sure we.
**Lhoran**: Have all those areas covered.
**Lhoran**: One thing, in addition to the TV location, your conference room.
**Lhoran**: Do you have a plan?
**Lhoran**: Do you have a planned location, or do you need a location for a.
**Tkussow**: TV in your reception?
**Dmiles**: It's not a bad idea.
**Bwertz**: I'm going to say no, we don't have one now, Ted.
**Bwertz**: And that's.
**Bwertz**: I'm refreshed that we have one in the break room.
**Bwertz**: We used to have that rolling slide about news of applied that hasn't been updated since before.
**Bwertz**: COVID Covid.
**Bwertz**: So if you got a monitor, it means we got to maintain it.
**Bwertz**: We got to put something on it, and.
**Lhoran**: Sure.
**Dmiles**: Yeah.
**Dmiles**: But if you want to put blocking in the wall just in case we do something.
**Dmiles**: I don't know.
**Lhoran**: Yep.
**Lhoran**: Totally up to you.
**Lhoran**: It's easier, I would say, to apply the blocking.
**Lhoran**: Now.
**Lhoran**: The wall, though, is existing.
**Lhoran**: So that would mean tearing into the existing wall.
**Bwertz**: I would say probably not.
**Bwertz**: I guess I'll say no, just because if we're going to put them on there, we're also put power and some kind of a B and some other stuff.
**Bwertz**: So we have to cut it in and do all that stuff.
**Bwertz**: So we'll just.
**Dmiles**: Yeah, let's not tear it.
**Dmiles**: Let's not tear into an existing wall.
**Dmiles**: Just keep it.
**Dmiles**: Yeah.
**Dmiles**: Like it is.
**Bclymer**: Sounds good.
**Lhoran**: Not a problem.
**Tkussow**: Just wanted to triple check while we're talking about it.
**Lhoran**: So a couple things from our general notes.
**Lhoran**: All of your wall types, other than this new corridor wall which is shown here, are going to be C3S walls.
**Lhoran**: Meaning that.
**Tkussow**: And I'll kind of show you on our plan here.
**Lhoran**: Here's the C3S type.
**Lhoran**: So this is a wall that goes to the underside of your ceiling with a stud of 3 and 5, 8.
**Lhoran**: So your finished partition width is around 5 inches.
**Lhoran**: That is for every wall like I said, other than this corridor wall.
**Lhoran**: So meaning in kind of all areas shown, it would go just to the ceiling above, not to the deck.
**Lhoran**: So a D3s wall, same wall thickness, but goes to the deck above.
**Lhoran**: Do you need that kind of sound insulation or protection kind of between this conference room here?
**Bwertz**: Yes, we'd like to take that to the deck with the soundproofing currently today it ends at the deck and you can hear, you know, pretty clear outside the room.
**Lhoran**: Okay, we'll add that to these walls.
**Lhoran**: And then we will add.
**Lhoran**: I see we're missing a note for.
**Lhoran**: To confirm that your existing wall on this side, the new tenant side, is a D3S wall.
**Lhoran**: We'll add a note to double check.
**Tkussow**: That that wall goes to deck as.
**Bclymer**: Well for soundproof all of these.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Lhoran**: Any other walls that I could be.
**Lhoran**: Should be noted or concerned about.
**Lhoran**: I think these were the ones that obviously were the most.
**Tkussow**: We don't want any sound to leak through in those.
**Lhoran**: In those areas.
**Dmiles**: I don't know.
**Dmiles**: This is another curve ball.
**Dmiles**: But I could see doing a locking on the east wall.
**Dmiles**: The college conference to put a TV on that wall rather than the short wall, put it on the long wall.
**Lhoran**: Okay.
**Lhoran**: Yeah.
**Lhoran**: Your table right now.
**Dmiles**: I'm just throwing that out there.
**Lhoran**: Yeah, for sure.
**Lhoran**: Your table now, as we have noted, kind of runs.
**Lhoran**: This is size.
**Tkussow**: I'm just kind of giving you general.
**Lhoran**: Location is running like this.
**Lhoran**: So we can keep this location and add one on this wall or two on this wall.
**Lhoran**: It's totally up to you all.
**Lhoran**: Or we can remove it here and Lay it out here.
**Tkussow**: It's.
**Lhoran**: It's totally dependent upon what you're used to and how we can, you know.
**Tkussow**: Better modify that for you.
**Dmiles**: It's be easier to see if it was over on that wall.
**Dmiles**: I don't.
**Dmiles**: I don't know what the recommendations are for layout.
**Bwertz**: Maybe.
**Dmiles**: Lauren, you've done conference room layouts and stuff with TVs and stuff.
**Dmiles**: It just right now with.
**Dmiles**: With the, you know, the short.
**Dmiles**: On the short end like that, it gets hard to see at the far end.
**Lhoran**: Absolutely.
**Lhoran**: And you just have to think that there are some people sitting on this side of the table whose backs would be the.
**Lhoran**: The tv, you know, on this side.
**Lhoran**: So just something to consider.
**Lhoran**: It is a really long.
**Lhoran**: It's a pretty long table, so I understand that comment.
**Lhoran**: You're kind of bobbing heads as you're, you know, looking from this side down.
**Lhoran**: Does it benefit you to have two TVs maybe here side by side?
**Tkussow**: Again, I don't know what your existing.
**Lhoran**: Presentation system is like or if that's something you want to adapt for a.
**Tkussow**: Larger room or just a large conference room.
**Bwertz**: I think the one TV location is fine there at the south.
**Bwertz**: And then.
**Bwertz**: Yeah, if you want to put in.
**Bwertz**: Yeah, I haven't thought about that.
**Bwertz**: I hear what you're saying, because it is.
**Bwertz**: If you're sitting the back end, it's hard to see.
**Bwertz**: But again, if we're putting blocking in for a monitor there on the right side, we're gonna have to power and AV and everything else, too.
**Bwertz**: Yeah.
**Dmiles**: I can see the value here.
**Dmiles**: That we could talk about offline, maybe.
**Lhoran**: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Bwertz**: Let us figure that out.
**Bwertz**: Because the other question I've got, where you've got, you know, does that just go in the.
**Bwertz**: In between the mail room and the conference room?
**Bwertz**: We're already screwing with that new wall.
**Tkussow**: Yeah.
**Bwertz**: I mean, so I'm kind of wondering is.
**Bwertz**: I think there's value there.
**Bwertz**: Ted.
**Bwertz**: It just makes you wonder from a cost analysis.
**Bwertz**: Something else.
**Bwertz**: Since we're not really messing with that existing wall.
**Bwertz**: Does it go on?
**Bwertz**: But then again, I don't know if I like it there either, because as.
**Bwertz**: As everyone walks in, how many shoulders are going to bump into that tv?
**Lhoran**: Well, and I would say you're kind of, you know, when they're on this side and you're looking across the table, you're bought.
**Lhoran**: You're dodging heads to kind of see those TVs.
**Lhoran**: You're going to have an obstruction.
**Lhoran**: However it looks.
**Lhoran**: I would say just dodging quantity of people in the room.
**Lhoran**: So it's whatever you all are comfortable with and used to and how you want to adjust.
**Tkussow**: So I'm happy to document it however you prefer.
**Dmiles**: Yeah, let's have a meeting to talk about.
**Dmiles**: Separate meeting.
**Lhoran**: Yep.
**Lhoran**: I'm just going to put.
**Lhoran**: Then I'm going to remove these just for now.
**Lhoran**: As we're updating the drawings, we'll know what we know for sure.
**Lhoran**: And I'm going to have a.
**Lhoran**: Just, just.
**Tkussow**: Just to say that you all are going to confirm.
**Bclymer**: That sounds good.
**Lhoran**: Okay.
**Lhoran**: Last thing in the general notes that I wanted to bring to everyone's attention is we have that all appliances are going to be provided by Applied.
**Lhoran**: Currently that's just the new undercounter refrigerator.
**Tkussow**: Located in the large conference room.
**Lhoran**: Are you okay to spec those and.
**Tkussow**: Source those yourselves or would you prefer the GC have that in their scope?
**Bwertz**: I think we can do that.
**Bwertz**: We've got one now that'll be demoed out, so we just need to again, unplug it and store it somewhere and then we'll just, you know, put it back into this new location.
**Tkussow**: Okay, sounds great.
**Lhoran**: Okay, that's everything for the floor plan.
**Lhoran**: Again, that's just kind of general overall of what's going to happen in construction.
**Lhoran**: So we're going to get further into these pages with some more specifications.
**Lhoran**: But any questions or comments that I could have missed here?
**Dmiles**: I'm good, I'm good.
**Lhoran**: Next page is just the dimension plan.
**Lhoran**: Nothing that I feel like we need to call out specifically here.
**Tkussow**: So I'm going to go ahead and go to the next page.
**Lhoran**: So this is your RCP plan.
**Lhoran**: I did go ahead and send this CAD file over to Mark.
**Lhoran**: He had requested it, I think, for your reference and how you plan to do mep.
**Lhoran**: So again, for reference, our MEP for permitting follows this really simper simple mechanical diffuser relocation diagram here with some general notes that help us get through state permitting.
**Lhoran**: If you have further specification that you want to go through with Alito, I think we've talked about it in the past, but just go ahead and proceed with them on.
**Lhoran**: On any drawings that you all prefer to do that.
**Lhoran**: We just don't like to include them here because to require a stamp, it just.
**Lhoran**: It takes a little bit longer at this state, so.
**Tkussow**: And it's not required for your project.
**Lhoran**: So as we're looking at that, just know that again, ours is general and layout.
**Tkussow**: So we'll just lean on you all.
**Lhoran**: If you want to change anything that we've noted.
**Lhoran**: Okay, so let's go through the Keynotes again for here.
**Lhoran**: So we are working and you can kind of see the bleed over into some of your existing areas.
**Lhoran**: So keynote one, which you'll see kind of sprinkled throughout the plan is noting that there's no ceiling work in several of these areas.
**Lhoran**: So you'll see that in your break room in this smaller room here, kind of in this open office area.
**Lhoran**: So these notes are are sprinkled throughout for reference.
**Bwertz**: Can I ask for one?
**Bwertz**: Nevermind, never mind.
**Bwertz**: Nope, you're good.
**Lhoran**: For reference.
**Lhoran**: This is the legend of what you're seeing on the plan.
**Lhoran**: So anything in this light gray is out of contract scope.
**Lhoran**: Anything in the white area is in scope.
**Lhoran**: Our gypsum board or plot or drywall ceiling is noted in this kind of spec hatch here.
**Lhoran**: And any exposed deck ceiling is just kind of that bright white.
**Tkussow**: And most of that is existing.
**Lhoran**: You do have some existing 2 by 4 ceiling grid and tile and kind of these clouds over the desk here.
**Lhoran**: And then we're showing new that's going to align and match with existing kind of as you see, the light gray is existing, the dark black being new.
**Lhoran**: That's the layout of how that's going to work together.
**Lhoran**: So I can walk you through those.
**Tkussow**: Notes a little bit.
**Lhoran**: And then we do have switching shown on the ceiling with lighting.
**Tkussow**: And I'll talk about those lighting specs with you.
**Tkussow**: Those exist over here.
**Lhoran**: Gonna try.
**Lhoran**: I know it's kind of hard with so much information.
**Lhoran**: I'm gonna try to get everything shown on a page, but if I don't.
**Tkussow**: I apologize for moving around quickly.
**Lhoran**: Okay, so like I said, some of those areas are not gonna be touched.
**Lhoran**: So that's Keynote 1 on your plan.
**Lhoran**: Keynote 2 is new switching in this location.
**Lhoran**: So we're providing you kind of that overall switch here, thinking that this is accessible from reception.
**Lhoran**: So this is going to be controlling your open area and open office light.
**Tkussow**: Fixtures and that will be located on this side here.
**Lhoran**: So they'll run that in conjunction with.
**Tkussow**: Any other switchings you have like on this side of the plan.
**Lhoran**: Keynote three is new ceiling grid and tile.
**Lhoran**: Like I noted, that's going to align with the existing.
**Lhoran**: In this new open office area, we have that shown at the existing height to match in a line which is 8 foot 6 just for reference.
**Tkussow**: And that's off the finished floor.
**Lhoran**: And then that ceiling tile again is going to match existing.
**Lhoran**: So that HCT1 new acoustical ceiling is.
**Tkussow**: Going to match that existing.
**Lhoran**: So Keynote 4, this is to help that transition between exposed and grid and tile.
**Lhoran**: So Keynote 4, which is located here and these two kind of longer areas.
**Tkussow**: I apologize for the overlap there, but.
**Lhoran**: This is to where the ceiling grid and tile is.
**Lhoran**: A is adjacent from the exposed ceiling areas to provide the axiom trim along that edge to match the same style.
**Tkussow**: And size is what's going on over here.
**Tkussow**: So again, we're just trying to make sure that.
**Bclymer**: Oops.
**Lhoran**: We're trying to make sure that all.
**Tkussow**: Of those finishes visually look identical so.
**Lhoran**: That we're not seeing a big what would be visual change.
**Tkussow**: And new to existing.
**Lhoran**: Keynote five is in this area with that new reception double glass entry door is to provide a bulkhead with support as required for the new entry system door.
**Lhoran**: And we just want to make sure that this matches the building standard and.
**Tkussow**: Aligns with what they do elsewhere throughout the building.
**Lhoran**: Again, we just want to make that cohesive throughout.
**Lhoran**: Keynote 6 is for new pendants over your reception desk.
**Lhoran**: Again, we were following pricing guidelines where these allowances were shown.
**Lhoran**: So we'll.
**Lhoran**: I'll show you what those look like.
**Tkussow**: On the design development if you proceed to move forward with accent lighting in that location.
**Lhoran**: And then Keynote 7 is for the exposed edge of drywall in some of your transition areas between the drywall, ceiling and ceiling tile is that to be finished and go to the underside of Act 1.
**Tkussow**: So again, just trying to make that finish as clean as possible in those locations.
**Lhoran**: So unless noted otherwise, we're going to have that same grid and tile again match that new that existing height of 8, 6.
**Lhoran**: We did do a full.
**Lhoran**: Emma did a full field verification of your space, which included those existing conditions.
**Tkussow**: So we just want to make sure.
**Lhoran**: That all of that aligns and then all of your.
**Lhoran**: I'm going through the general notes here.
**Lhoran**: All of your switching and face plate devices are to match existing again to.
**Tkussow**: Make that as cohesive as possible.
**Bwertz**: Your conference room, where you're talking about switching, can you move that to the other side of the door?
**Bwertz**: So it's on the latch side, not the hinge side?
**Bwertz**: Is it not possible on.
**Lhoran**: You want me to put it on this side?
**Lhoran**: Yes, yes, we will see.
**Lhoran**: So like right now that you're saying because the door opens this way.
**Bwertz**: Yep.
**Lhoran**: Yes.
**Lhoran**: Let me see if we have.
**Lhoran**: We should have enough wall space there.
**Tkussow**: We'll just double check on that.
**Bwertz**: If not.
**Bwertz**: I was gonna say move that wall too.
**Bwertz**: You know, move that little notch wall two feet south, we'll lose a little bit of counter space or a foot south or something.
**Bwertz**: Whatever's got to be done.
**Bclymer**: Okay, perfect.
**Lhoran**: So we can stay on conference room while we're talking about it.
**Lhoran**: So for your conference room ceiling, again, we are following the pricing guideline description of how we plan to do these ceilings.
**Lhoran**: And I know we talked about this and did kind of a visual representation.
**Tkussow**: During the pricing guideline exercise.
**Lhoran**: So we have a bulkhead in that drywall that's going to be painted just general.
**Lhoran**: It's just your general overall wall color, which is just white.
**Lhoran**: We have four recessed linears that are running the length here to help provide lighting to your table underneath.
**Lhoran**: So these are going to be recessed up into the drywall.
**Lhoran**: Because your ceiling Height in here is 8, 4, we're not raising anything above what we know existing ceiling heights to be, just in case the equipment above the ceiling doesn't allow for it to go higher.
**Lhoran**: So with that not low, but lower ceiling height of 8, 4, we think recess is going to be best here.
**Lhoran**: Not to disrupt any presentation equipment.
**Lhoran**: We do have these four on dimmers.
**Lhoran**: And then all the can lights that are supporting lighting around your space and over this casework here is also on a dimmer and on their own switch.
**Lhoran**: So for presentation purposes, you can adjust.
**Tkussow**: That to your liking.
**Tkussow**: And then that surround ceiling, as you can see, is that act 2x4 ceiling shown here.
**Lhoran**: So you do have a small change in ceiling height.
**Lhoran**: So you'll have a change of ceiling height from the 86 to the 8 4.
**Tkussow**: So that bulkhead is dropped down just slightly there.
**Lhoran**: Any questions for that conference room?
**Tkussow**: And then we'll jump over to reception in other areas so you can see it.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Lhoran**: For your reception, we have, again, following pricing guidelines, we have dry and I think some exercises we did after thereafter and some communication, we have drywall ceiling at 8ft 4 inches noted in your reception area with can lights.
**Lhoran**: These are all these can lights are on dimmers.
**Lhoran**: And then your pendant lights or accent lighting over your reception desk is also.
**Tkussow**: On a dimmer and switch separately.
**Lhoran**: And then your mail room follows just a general layout of the Act 1 ceiling to help provide lighting in this area.
**Lhoran**: And then you do have one light with one switch.
**Lhoran**: These are both just these.
**Lhoran**: None of these switches are on dimmers.
**Lhoran**: These are just your.
**Tkussow**: Your general occupancy sensor on this storage room and this mail room.
**Lhoran**: Any questions there?
**Lhoran**: Okay, if there's nothing else for the ceiling, we'll go ahead and move along.
**Lhoran**: Power data.
**Lhoran**: Okay, so for power and data, we are following just some general information we have about your furniture to determine these locations and then overall accessible locations throughout your office.
**Lhoran**: So because from our Field verification.
**Lhoran**: We do have noted anything existing is in this light gray color with an E above it.
**Lhoran**: Anything new is going to be noted in the dark black line with no indicator of that it is existing or that E above it.
**Lhoran**: I'll start on this side of the plan just to help us go from page to page.
**Lhoran**: So keynote one, which I have a red box here for us to talk about the requirements for your tv, but that's to provide electrical for your tv.
**Lhoran**: We have those noted as a duplex and data at 60 inches off the finished floor.
**Lhoran**: Sometimes we have people who do duplex data.
**Lhoran**: HDMI or just duplex and HDMI or a quad or, you know, there's a combination there.
**Lhoran**: Do you know the requirements for your TV that will be going in this location.
**Bwertz**: Today?
**Bwertz**: What we do is we've got kind of a pathway between the TV and where the computer sits.
**Bwertz**: And likely, given that we've got that counter space, I guess I haven't thought about this.
**Bwertz**: We probably don't have room for another table.
**Bwertz**: Well, we've got a small credenza.
**Bwertz**: So I guess if there's room for a small credenza similar like we have now, we really just need kind of a pathway between behind the TV and that computer.
**Bwertz**: That way, the.
**Bwertz**: And then we'll route the HDMI cable, whatever is needed between the two.
**Lhoran**: Okay, so we need to add an HDMI then to your TV location.
**Bwertz**: Well, I.
**Bwertz**: I think pathway, I think is the correct term.
**Bwertz**: I don't know if I do hdmi, but a pathway, I think between where the.
**Bwertz**: Yes.
**Lhoran**: Well, when I hear pathway, I think the TV requires, still requires an HDMI hookup.
**Lhoran**: Is that correct, or are you saying that you would just do a plug.
**Tkussow**: Into your tv, not so much through the wall.
**Bwertz**: So basically from behind the tv, there'd be a pathway from that TV over to where the credenza sits.
**Bwertz**: And then we'll route an HDMI cable behind the TV to where the PC is going to sit.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So, Lauren, would you want us to put some conduit in the wall, make a raceway for you guys to pull that cord?
**Bwertz**: Okay, perfect.
**Lhoran**: All right, we'll do conduit for hdmi.
**Bwertz**: And then again, I'm wondering, I think it looks at where you've got the existing receptacle and the data jack.
**Bwertz**: I wonder if that should move to the far corner.
**Bwertz**: Thinking that again, I know you guys were in their office taking pictures.
**Bwertz**: I don't remember how big that little credenza is that the computer sits in, but I'm thinking It probably wants to be in the bottom right corner versus the bottom left.
**Bwertz**: Just because that and the refrigerator door opening might fight each other if we don't put it opposite existing.
**Mlehman**: You ought to just leave it.
**Mlehman**: Just add another one.
**Lhoran**: Yes, we will.
**Lhoran**: We won't demo that power because in conference rooms generally more power is better.
**Lhoran**: So we'll leave that existing duplex outlet that's shown.
**Lhoran**: We'll relocate the new data location over to this wall with a new outlet as well.
**Tkussow**: Is this the location you were thinking, Lauren?
**Bwertz**: Yeah.
**Bwertz**: Somewhere there should work.
**Bwertz**: Yeah, as far in that corner as possible.
**Bwertz**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bwertz**: Sorry.
**Bwertz**: What'd you say, Brad?
**Bwertz**: Didn't hear you right on the new wall section.
**Mlehman**: That's perfect.
**Lhoran**: It's great how that works out.
**Lhoran**: Do you need a data hookup for your television?
**Lhoran**: I know that's a little.
**Lhoran**: Getting a little bit dated now with.
**Tkussow**: So much streaming technology.
**Tkussow**: If not, we can have that removed and just do the duplex with a conduit for hdmi.
**Bwertz**: I don't know.
**Bwertz**: I mean, I know we definitely.
**Bwertz**: The data there where the credenza where your error is pointing at.
**Bwertz**: I mean, we don't use anything streaming wise.
**Bwertz**: We're not, you know, we don't have Hulu on or anything like that during normal times.
**Bwertz**: So.
**Bwertz**: No, I'm going to say we probably don't need data behind the TV if we've got that conduit.
**Bclymer**: Oh, go ahead and remove that then.
**Lhoran**: And then, just to reiterate, we do this at 60 inches off the finished floor.
**Lhoran**: So that's 60 inches to the middle of the back of your TV.
**Lhoran**: That's pretty standard.
**Lhoran**: If you have a different height, obviously.
**Tkussow**: We can adjust that accordingly.
**Bwertz**: I think that sounds okay, Brad.
**Bwertz**: If you got a tape measure, I mean, again, there's one behind the.
**Bwertz**: The existing ones.
**Bwertz**: Whatever.
**Bwertz**: Whatever we have now works.
**Bwertz**: Great.
**Lhoran**: Okay.
**Lhoran**: Do you plan to relocate that existing television?
**Mlehman**: Well, we may have to.
**Mlehman**: Yeah, 60 inches is fine.
**Mlehman**: That's what it is today.
**Bclymer**: Great.
**Bclymer**: Perfect.
**Bwertz**: Again, haven't talked about relocating it.
**Bwertz**: I think let's assume that it will be and if not, then we'll.
**Bwertz**: We'll have to buy a new one.
**Lhoran**: Okay.
**Lhoran**: Yep, no problem.
**Lhoran**: Okay, so sticking in this conference room, we'll just hit these room by room.
**Lhoran**: We have noted your keynote4 as to provide a floor core which will provide a duplex and data hookup location in the floor for your conference room table.
**Lhoran**: Is that a requirement that your table has now, is there power in the table and would you like to keep that?
**Bwertz**: Our current table does not have power in it.
**Bwertz**: So we need some ability to.
**Bwertz**: Sorry, start.
**Bwertz**: Start with floor box.
**Bwertz**: I don't think we need data in there.
**Bwertz**: Most people who have their laptops who've got WI fi, so I don't think we need data at the table.
**Bclymer**: Okay, great.
**Lhoran**: HDMI maybe.
**Mlehman**: It's a long way to run your.
**Bwertz**: Good question.
**Lhoran**: Okay, well, just say that you can confirm.
**Lhoran**: And again, we don't have to know this right now.
**Lhoran**: So if these are things that.
**Lhoran**: If you set up weekly construction calls or anything like that with the Alito group, you know, that can be up.
**Tkussow**: For discussion later as well.
**Dmiles**: So if it's HDMI there, then you could hook your laptop into the monitor, Correct?
**Bwertz**: Yeah.
**Bwertz**: And again, it'd be something similar.
**Bwertz**: We'd probably just route a conduit from the back behind the monitor all the way to that floor box.
**Bwertz**: That way it's a continuous cable from one to the other versus what we do now, which is we've got an HDMI cable just kind of sits behind the computer, and then someone plugs in that first seat.
**Bwertz**: So it's probably not a bad idea.
**Bwertz**: Just hadn't thought about it.
**Lhoran**: Yeah, that's okay.
**Lhoran**: I would say that now is a good time.
**Lhoran**: Just think about if there are any inefficiencies in your streaming system as you get into a conference room.
**Lhoran**: We can plan those new power locations or HDMI locations pretty well planned out to, you know, to work better so.
**Tkussow**: We can again work through that in the future.
**Lhoran**: Okay, so for your large conference room, we have power location for the undercounter refrigerator.
**Lhoran**: And then we have two.
**Lhoran**: Yes.
**Bwertz**: Sorry.
**Bwertz**: Go back to the conference table.
**Bwertz**: So our current.
**Bwertz**: You.
**Bwertz**: I think you asked.
**Bwertz**: Our current table does not have power at the.
**Bwertz**: In the.
**Bwertz**: On the tabletop.
**Bwertz**: So we would need somehow or somebody to cut in some.
**Bwertz**: Some receptacles that can then plug into the floor box.
**Bwertz**: I don't know.
**Lhoran**: Are you doing any new furniture with a previous furniture group that you all have used for your open office?
**Bwertz**: Talking the cubicles.
**Lhoran**: Mm.
**Bwertz**: We'll probably do that, I guess, for the conference.
**Bwertz**: Our assumption was the conference room table.
**Bwertz**: We just reuse what we've got and move it over there.
**Bwertz**: Yes.
**Lhoran**: The reason I was asking is because sometimes that's the service that they can.
**Tkussow**: Add on to your scope of work.
**Bwertz**: Okay.
**Lhoran**: Just because they do that a lot in tables that don't have power, if they order something in or they do a special system.
**Lhoran**: So whoever you are working with for furniture, I would just go ahead and tag that conference room.
**Lhoran**: You know, they can drill into your plastic laminate or wood or whatever that is.
**Lhoran**: Typically, that's something that they can do.
**Tkussow**: So I would.
**Lhoran**: I would ask them to do it first before maybe general construction, just because.
**Tkussow**: That'S their specialty for furniture.
**Bwertz**: Okay, sounds good.
**Bwertz**: Thank you.
**Lhoran**: Yeah, of course.
**Mlehman**: Might want two floor boxes, Lauren.
**Mlehman**: Just because the way these pedestals are, there's.
**Mlehman**: There's three of them, and they're in the center.
**Mlehman**: There's three tables.
**Bwertz**: Nah, Brad, don't do that.
**Bwertz**: That costs money.
**Bwertz**: What you do is you come up one, you come up one, and then you daisy chain under the table is what you do.
**Bwertz**: That's a lot.
**Lhoran**: Yeah, I would say.
**Tkussow**: I would say in that instance, with.
**Lhoran**: Such a long table, a daisy chain is typical for underneath there.
**Lhoran**: And again, the furniture vendor can help.
**Tkussow**: Do some cord management for you as well.
**Lhoran**: But if you want to add one, now's the time.
**Tkussow**: Okay.
**Lhoran**: So again, working through your large conference room, we have two outlets above the counter here, above this casework.
**Lhoran**: Just general outlets.
**Lhoran**: If you have coffee machine or other requirements or, you know, we've talked about people having computers, whatever that is.
**Lhoran**: And then we have just general power access on each of the walls.
**Lhoran**: We do not have any power on the existing core and shell because adding.
**Tkussow**: Power to the shell can be really expensive.
**Lhoran**: So if you needed one on this north side, we can probably pull it down from this column here.
**Lhoran**: But it feels like you have enough.
**Tkussow**: Power in this room, generally speaking.
**Lhoran**: Okay, we'll go to your mail and copy next.
**Lhoran**: So our Keynote 2 talks about confirming this dedicated outlet and this data location for your copier slash printer here.
**Lhoran**: So Alito can work with that with you.
**Lhoran**: And then in this L shaped casework, and we'll review casework, we have two convenience outlets above the counter, and we have one data location.
**Lhoran**: And on this side, same thing.
**Tkussow**: Two convenience outlets above the counter and one data location.
**Lhoran**: Anything else we should note for this mail and copy room?
**Lhoran**: Okay, reception and storage.
**Lhoran**: So we have pulled here from the storage wall a location for a duplex and data hookup for the person sitting at your reception desk.
**Lhoran**: And we could provide some grommet holes in the top for easy hookup to their equipment.
**Lhoran**: We have a general outlet here on this wall.
**Tkussow**: If you choose not to do it, totally fine.
**Lhoran**: You have another existing one on this side.
**Lhoran**: And then we have one general outlet in your storage room.
**Lhoran**: If you do need any power hookups.
**Bclymer**: There.
**Lhoran**: In your library and open office.
**Lhoran**: Again, anything you see in this light gray is already existing.
**Lhoran**: And then we have shown three new power.
**Lhoran**: These are actually Junction boxes for furniture and data locations.
**Lhoran**: Assuming these are the best places for.
**Tkussow**: You to hook up furniture.
**Lhoran**: And this is noted when we did.
**Tkussow**: Space plan and furniture kind of layout.
**Bwertz**: Plan previously for that new three you've got there.
**Bwertz**: And the.
**Bwertz**: Yep.
**Bwertz**: I guess I can't really know.
**Bwertz**: Is that from above.
**Bwertz**: The one that's on the furthest north.
**Bwertz**: Not that one.
**Bwertz**: That one.
**Lhoran**: This one.
**Bwertz**: Yeah.
**Bwertz**: I'm guessing that'll be a pain in the butt to try and get it through the glass there.
**Bwertz**: So today what we do, we just have it coming through overhead into cubicles.
**Bwertz**: So I gotta believe that's got.
**Bwertz**: Yeah.
**Bwertz**: Power pole.
**Bwertz**: Thank you.
**Bwertz**: That's what I was looking for.
**Lhoran**: Yeah, for sure.
**Lhoran**: We can change that to a powerful location.
**Lhoran**: Do you have that closest to the window line or maybe hanging out further on this side towards the end?
**Bwertz**: We have it closest to the window line.
**Bclymer**: Okay, they'll change that.
**Lhoran**: And then that keynote three is that that furniture?
**Lhoran**: That furniture system and equipment.
**Lhoran**: They're going to coordinate Alito will those.
**Tkussow**: Exact requirements with your furniture vendor on what power is required there.
**Lhoran**: We just don't note it at this time in case that's a change later.
**Tkussow**: We don't want to be the record holder for furniture power.
**Tkussow**: We just want to give general location.
**Bwertz**: That's fine.
**Bwertz**: I think that should work for general locations.
**Bwertz**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Lhoran**: Moving into your break room.
**Lhoran**: So all of this is existing power.
**Lhoran**: All of that's going to remain on your island.
**Lhoran**: We had there was a request to have power located there.
**Tkussow**: So I think the Alita group did.
**Lhoran**: Price out adding kind of floor power as required for this casework.
**Lhoran**: We have an outlet shown on each side.
**Lhoran**: Thinking that that's best probably for hookup unless you have a preferred or a different location that you'd like for those or a different use that we're unaware of.
**Lhoran**: But right now we have two outlets.
**Tkussow**: At 32 inches off the finished floor on your island.
**Bwertz**: I think that works.
**Bwertz**: I just would ask make sure that's on a new circuit, not on other stuff.
**Bwertz**: And the whole reason is because we kind of do kind of chili cook offs or soup stuff and we're trying to figure out how to get that stuff there.
**Bwertz**: So I ideally, I guess we'll need.
**Lhoran**: To make these dedicated for you.
**Bwertz**: Yeah.
**Tkussow**: Okay.
**Tkussow**: We can do that.
**Bclymer**: Doable.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Lhoran**: That is all of power.
**Lhoran**: Again, you have a lot of existing power in here.
**Lhoran**: That's already noted on the plan.
**Lhoran**: Anything else that I should be aware of?
**Lhoran**: I know your signage isn't.
**Tkussow**: It's not backlit so no requirements there we only have your one television here.
**Lhoran**: And depending on if you add more.
**Tkussow**: In this conference room, of course we can adapt that.
**Tkussow**: But anything else that I should note?
**Bwertz**: I don't think so.
**Bwertz**: Then your sign made me think about our current sign.
**Bwertz**: We've got a wall wash light that sits in front of it.
**Bwertz**: I probably should have looked at that on the sealant reflected ceiling plan, make sure there's some kind of.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, we can do that.
**Lhoran**: We'll add a wall washer and then we'll get an exact.
**Tkussow**: Probably like a six foot length.
**Tkussow**: If your sign is close to six foot here.
**Bclymer**: Great.
**Lhoran**: Good call.
**Lhoran**: We'll remove that can light or shift.
**Tkussow**: It down just to balance out that.
**Bclymer**: Light a little bit.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Dmiles**: Would it make sense for in the break room for those end on the island to make those quads rather than just duplex?
**Bwertz**: That's probably a better idea than using the power strips like we do now.
**Bwertz**: Yes.
**Lhoran**: Oh, yeah, let's not use a power strip anymore.
**Lhoran**: We can upgrade that.
**Tkussow**: Okay, we can do that for sure.
**Dmiles**: As far as existing, there is a TV in there right now to the.
**Dmiles**: On the north wall.
**Lhoran**: Yes.
**Dmiles**: So it must have some power over there.
**Dmiles**: There's a PC in the corner.
**Dmiles**: I don't know if we keep all that or not, but.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Lhoran**: Yeah, for sure, we can talk about that.
**Mlehman**: Well, they're not taking it out.
**Lhoran**: It's just.
**Mlehman**: They just don't have it show.
**Bwertz**: Yeah.
**Dmiles**: Existing to remain.
**Lhoran**: Yep.
**Lhoran**: Okay.
**Lhoran**: All right, we're going to move to your door schedule, which is really short and sweet.
**Lhoran**: So we'll go through this pretty quickly.
**Lhoran**: So just general notes for here is that the doors, the intent is for all doors to match existing standard size, style, which species and stain throughout your existing side.
**Lhoran**: So they're going to reuse existing from demolition where possible and then provide new.
**Tkussow**: As required again to match that existing.
**Lhoran**: Same intent for frames and hardware.
**Lhoran**: So we just want to make sure.
**Tkussow**: That all of that is working well and cohesive with your existing layout.
**Lhoran**: So we'll go line by line through your doors.
**Lhoran**: So reception door, I'll increase that line.
**Lhoran**: I think this area, your reception door, this is new.
**Lhoran**: This is a D3 door which if you can see down here, this is that elevation for that, for that door.
**Lhoran**: So this is going to be your building standard kind of double glass entry door system.
**Lhoran**: So on Keynote 2 here we are just confirming.
**Tkussow**: We want them to confirm with building order, with building owner, the exact finish, style, hardware requirements, all of that.
**Tkussow**: So we want to make sure that matches the building existing and I guess the Only.
**Bwertz**: And I'm not sure what the building system is, but I remember doing this seven years ago, we moved in.
**Bwertz**: I think the hardware might be a little different, but I want to double check our current hardware.
**Bwertz**: We've got the lock where you can stand at a reasonable height and lock the doors versus having to bend down and lock it in the floor.
**Bwertz**: We'd like to keep that.
**Bwertz**: I really don't want people having to bend over to turn a lock at the floor.
**Lhoran**: Sure, absolutely.
**Lhoran**: I will.
**Lhoran**: I will put that on you all to confirm with the landlord and owner.
**Lhoran**: Just based upon if that requirement can.
**Tkussow**: Be duplicated in this location.
**Tkussow**: I would assume so, but since that's the working relationship there, I think it'd be best to be communicated that way.
**Tkussow**: If you agree.
**Bwertz**: Let me put the note down.
**Bwertz**: But yeah, my assumption, whatever we have now, I want to match that.
**Bwertz**: I guess that's.
**Bwertz**: That's where I'm going at with this.
**Tkussow**: Okay, that makes sense.
**Lhoran**: Alito, anything you need from us from that remark from Lauren at all?
**Jdawson**: No, I just.
**Jdawson**: I would like to.
**Jdawson**: If you could connect us with the landlord so when we do start construction, we can just keep.
**Jdawson**: Keep them in the loop on everything going on.
**Jdawson**: I send out weekly reports.
**Tkussow**: Okay, great.
**Jdawson**: So, yeah, yeah.
**Lhoran**: And all of that, like I said, if it's anything related to landlord, you know, corridor scope, you know, all of that needs to be communicated with them directly.
**Lhoran**: We don't like to be the middleman.
**Tkussow**: On that just because again, that working relationship is typically between tenant and contractor, and it's generally a little bit outside of our scope.
**Lhoran**: If we need to jump in, of.
**Tkussow**: Course, for documentation or anything else, we can help with that, convey design intent, but we prefer that communication to go.
**Lhoran**: Through you, if you agree.
**Jdawson**: Yep, that'd be great.
**Jdawson**: And do you have that door type?
**Jdawson**: I.
**Jdawson**: I have a bunch of pictures of it, but I wasn't sure.
**Jdawson**: No, I know the manufacturer.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Lhoran**: I can find out.
**Lhoran**: Yeah, And I would ask because again, depending on if they have something different on a different floor or if they've changed standards at all, just to confirm with them, they probably have that standard.
**Tkussow**: In a building standards folder for them.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, just connect me with them and.
**Jdawson**: And I'll ask the questions.
**Lhoran**: Okay.
**Lhoran**: I think we haven't talked to the landlord directly, so since our contracts through Applied Engineering.
**Tkussow**: So I would either reach out to Houston or maybe Lauren can get you connected.
**Bwertz**: Awesome.
**Jdawson**: I can reach out to Houston.
**Lhoran**: So your coat closet, which is located in reception here, that is existing and all that.
**Tkussow**: We plan to stay existing since it.
**Lhoran**: Works at that location, storage 302, which is this new storage room.
**Lhoran**: That door is to be a D1 door.
**Lhoran**: So that's just a solid door slab with a single use frame.
**Lhoran**: And we have a storeroom lock set on that.
**Lhoran**: Thinking that that would.
**Lhoran**: That room would be locked in reception.
**Lhoran**: Should I change that or is that applicable to this location?
**Tkussow**: Lauren?
**Bwertz**: No, it doesn't need a store.
**Bwertz**: It doesn't need to have a lock on it.
**Bwertz**: And then do you recall on the demo plan how big the door is to our current storage room that we're losing?
**Bwertz**: Again, I'm trying to remember how.
**Bwertz**: I feel like it's 3.0door, but again, I just want to confirm that because we again will probably end up sliding a cart into that new storage space.
**Bclymer**: Let's double check.
**Lhoran**: Looks like a 3O door to me.
**Lhoran**: Or is it a little bit bigger?
**Lhoran**: We'll confirm that and double check that we're going back with the exact same.
**Tkussow**: Size if that's preferred.
**Lhoran**: Hey, Lydia.
**Lhoran**: We can double check our survey, but.
**Tkussow**: The door you're just looking at looks like 4ft in the Archicad file.
**Bclymer**: Perfect.
**Lhoran**: Thank you.
**Bwertz**: Sarah, I want to make sure you're looking at the right spot because I think.
**Bclymer**: Oh, sure.
**Bwertz**: Sorry, Rosa.
**Bwertz**: I was muting.
**Bwertz**: And also I'm like, wait a second.
**Bclymer**: That's okay.
**Bwertz**: Myself.
**Lhoran**: That's rcp.
**Tkussow**: One second.
**Bclymer**: There we go.
**Bwertz**: I'm to the left here.
**Bwertz**: Yep.
**Bwertz**: That down a little bit.
**Bwertz**: That's the conference room.
**Bwertz**: Go down right there.
**Lhoran**: This one?
**Bwertz**: Whatever.
**Bwertz**: Yeah, Whatever size door that is, the cart fits through that door opening.
**Bwertz**: Barely.
**Bwertz**: I just want to make sure our door is the new door for that space is the same.
**Bwertz**: Same width.
**Lhoran**: Yep.
**Lhoran**: Three zero.
**Bclymer**: Okay, perfect.
**Lhoran**: Okay, so we'll just do a standard then a passage set lock for that or just a passage set for that door with no lock.
**Tkussow**: And you said it didn't need a lock.
**Lhoran**: Does that suffice?
**Tkussow**: I guess for that location, that should be fine.
**Bwertz**: And then you know, the existing for that closet door.
**Bwertz**: I don't recall what kind of wood that is.
**Bwertz**: Does that make the same wood stain everything else as the rest of our space or is it different?
**Bclymer**: We'll.
**Lhoran**: We'll flip through and confirm it should.
**Lhoran**: It should match throughout.
**Lhoran**: But we'll.
**Tkussow**: We'll triple check on that for you.
**Bwertz**: Okay.
**Lhoran**: Okay.
**Lhoran**: I know we're pressed for time.
**Lhoran**: Is there anyone who needs to jump off right at noon here?
**Dmiles**: I'm okay to continue.
**Tkussow**: Great.
**Lhoran**: Keep pressing.
**Lhoran**: All right, so your conference room door.
**Lhoran**: That is a D2 door.
**Lhoran**: So that's a.
**Lhoran**: A wood door with a glass kit insert.
**Lhoran**: And then we do show a side light on that door.
**Lhoran**: It's a.
**Lhoran**: We'll clean this up here we have a side light shown on.
**Lhoran**: On that side again to allow light to come through and just to kind of upgrade that conference room a little bit.
**Lhoran**: Our remark one, which is not located on your remark schedule here is to provide frost film on that door inside light.
**Lhoran**: The exact design is to be determined.
**Lhoran**: We're assuming it's a 75 glass coverage.
**Lhoran**: So thinking if you are, you know, applying a film, you know, maybe it's through the center or across the whole thing.
**Tkussow**: You know, we can confirm design on that.
**Lhoran**: And then we are going to do an upgraded push pull bar pool, a 24 inch brush stainless.
**Lhoran**: It will look something like this.
**Lhoran**: Again, just to dress up that door.
**Bwertz**: A little bit, can we just have a regular latch?
**Bwertz**: I guess.
**Bwertz**: How does that bar pole work with latching?
**Lhoran**: So this is a.
**Lhoran**: It's got a push pull, it's got a closer on it and then it has a hold open.
**Bwertz**: So that seems way too fancy.
**Bwertz**: We're just used to.
**Bwertz**: Let's just simplify it and kind of what we got now with just a regular latch, if we want it closed, we can make sure it's latch closed.
**Bwertz**: Have a conversation, leave it open.
**Bwertz**: We just leave it open.
**Bclymer**: Perfect.
**Lhoran**: Totally fine with that.
**Bclymer**: We'll remove this guy here.
**Lhoran**: We'll remove the part about your purple here.
**Lhoran**: Okay.
**Lhoran**: And then for your break room, we're adding a new door.
**Lhoran**: So on this side here we go back up here.
**Lhoran**: This break room door is going to be a D2 door.
**Lhoran**: So it's going to have that glass kit insert and it's going to have that standard frame around it.
**Lhoran**: And then we have a passage set noted on this door.
**Lhoran**: So similar comment to your conference room.
**Lhoran**: You can open it, you can close it, you can leave it open.
**Tkussow**: Totally up to you all on that.
**Bwertz**: Okay.
**Bwertz**: Yep, that's fine.
**Bwertz**: Ted, remind me when we all meet internally.
**Bwertz**: I forgot we're adding a door.
**Bwertz**: It wasn't where we're going to add a door to the.
**Bwertz**: To the break room.
**Bwertz**: I thought we're trying to do minimal there so it may just be me not paying attention.
**Dmiles**: Yeah, I had mentioned adding a just.
**Dmiles**: Just for the noise of that room, I guess.
**Dmiles**: Or if we do do anything in.
**Bwertz**: There, I mean, I guess I'm again internally.
**Bwertz**: Just how often is that door really going to be closed?
**Bwertz**: I guess is my thought.
**Lhoran**: Yep, let us know we can adapt.
**Tkussow**: How we need to.
**Lhoran**: Okay, so we're going to go through your casework now.
**Lhoran**: So pulling it up on this big screen so we can see it best, we're going to start in your mail and copy.
**Lhoran**: So for reference, we are looking at this wall here with that male unit shown on it.
**Lhoran**: So we have noted below that you're going to have 3 foot by 24 inch deep lower cabinets.
**Lhoran**: The layout that we have shown is you have a pull out double bin waste drawer here.
**Lhoran**: And then on the opposite side you have a three drawer stack.
**Lhoran**: And then below you have double door openings with a single drawer above.
**Lhoran**: You have a two foot break between the counter and the upper cabinets above.
**Lhoran**: And then these are 3 foot high, 12 inch deep upper cabinets.
**Lhoran**: And we've kind of reflected that layout to the mirror on, on both sides for that.
**Dmiles**: Which one was this again?
**Lhoran**: This is this area.
**Dmiles**: Okay.
**Lhoran**: Any comments, sir?
**Bwertz**: Yeah, let me.
**Bwertz**: Yeah, I don't know any of the drawers on the right.
**Bwertz**: I'll have to go back through and see what we have in our current mail room.
**Bwertz**: I don't think we have any drawers, period.
**Lhoran**: Okay.
**Lhoran**: And this is something too where if you all are still reviewing a couple things internally and you want to go stand in the break room with these drawings or whatever it might be, definitely.
**Tkussow**: Feel free to do that.
**Lhoran**: So we can remove the drawers and.
**Tkussow**: Just do doors as well.
**Bwertz**: Yeah, let's sit and find out what we have.
**Bwertz**: And because again, would we even use it?
**Bwertz**: I'm also trying to wrap my mind around, I think it's a neat idea to hide the trash can.
**Bwertz**: The other part of me is like, will anybody know it's there?
**Lhoran**: We typically have people label it as a, as a waste drawer.
**Lhoran**: And it is nice in a room where you don't have a lot of available other wall space to kind of keep that inside of casework.
**Lhoran**: And since it is a double bin, you can layer them as trash and recycling or whatever that might be.
**Lhoran**: So just something to think about when you're thinking about space and layout.
**Lhoran**: Okay, moving to this side of the plan here.
**Lhoran**: So here we have shown again those 3 foot high, 24 inch deep lower casework pieces.
**Lhoran**: And then kind of mirroring that on top, trying to as much with layout the upper cabinets.
**Lhoran**: Again we're in this corner here.
**Lhoran**: So on this is the copier side, which you can see here, general layout.
**Tkussow**: That matches the other side as well.
**Lhoran**: And we can, like I said, if you don't have any drawers, we can.
**Tkussow**: Let you confirm drawers and all that as well.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Lhoran**: In your large conference room.
**Lhoran**: This is that new casework going here with your undercounter refrigerator, we have these at 3ft high.
**Lhoran**: We'll have an opening here for your undercounter refrigerator.
**Lhoran**: We'll have a filler panel on this side just to frame that out.
**Lhoran**: We have double doors with drawers above and then again that pull out waste bin located on the side closest to the door.
**Lhoran**: Here we have no upper shelves.
**Lhoran**: Typically we see this used as more of like a built in furniture piece.
**Tkussow**: So that's not something we typically see.
**Lhoran**: But we can definitely add it if you need it.
**Dmiles**: Those waste and recycling.
**Lhoran**: Well, it's just a double bin drawer so you can put it to however you feel.
**Lhoran**: So that drawer just pulls out and you have two bins inside of it.
**Lhoran**: There's no grommets or anything in the counter above just to help with cost.
**Lhoran**: So you can label those how you prefer.
**Lhoran**: Okay, I'm going to head over to your island.
**Lhoran**: So this one needs a little bit of discussion just because of the request for I believe five seats at the island and just our clearances that we have around it.
**Tkussow**: So I'm actually going to go to our dimension plan to talk about this one.
**Lhoran**: So you can see here, it's pretty tight as we're showing it with the size.
**Lhoran**: So it's 10ft overall.
**Lhoran**: Asking for five seats.
**Lhoran**: Typically we plan 2ft of width per person.
**Lhoran**: That's how we got to that 10ft requirement.
**Lhoran**: If you want to open up this a little bit, we could adjust that to a four person seated island and then we would, you know, shrink this down to 8ft.
**Lhoran**: That would help open up these walkways a little bit.
**Lhoran**: For reference, the cabinets are on this side and the stools are on this side.
**Lhoran**: So as you're seeing it looking towards my arrow, you have the double door with drawers.
**Lhoran**: Drawers.
**Lhoran**: You have that pull out waste bin and then you have that same door.
**Tkussow**: And drawer mirrored on the opposite side.
**Tkussow**: And your outlets are shown on these ends.
**Lhoran**: This is at a standard counter height.
**Lhoran**: So standard counter stools will fit under not bar stools.
**Lhoran**: So just keep that in mind as you're looking at it from a profile view.
**Lhoran**: Again, you have that cabinet doors on the front.
**Lhoran**: You have a one foot overhang on.
**Tkussow**: This side and your stools would sit on that side.
**Lhoran**: Any comments there?
**Mlehman**: How tall did you say that was?
**Lhoran**: It's three feet.
**Lhoran**: So yep.
**Tkussow**: So counter height.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Lhoran**: On the back side.
**Lhoran**: So this is the stool side.
**Lhoran**: So you would have, you know, those, those counter stools sitting underneath here we have a plastic laminate that wraps the back side of that, just to help.
**Tkussow**: With scuffs and kicking and all of that.
**Lhoran**: Okay, so we're going to move to your reception desk.
**Lhoran**: So this one actually I'm going to.
**Bclymer**: Split the view and show our double layout here.
**Lhoran**: So this is the overall layout of your reception desk on this side.
**Lhoran**: So you can see that pretty easily.
**Lhoran**: So we'll start from the front view.
**Lhoran**: So this is view nine.
**Lhoran**: So this is when you walk into reception, this is the first thing you're going to see.
**Lhoran**: So our design intent here.
**Lhoran**: I know we didn't have a previous conversation about this.
**Lhoran**: We're just kind of not going back with what you have existing.
**Lhoran**: But following similar design intent, we have a.
**Lhoran**: And it might be easier to show intent with this section cut here.
**Lhoran**: We have a half wall that's being wrapped in a quartz up the top partially around.
**Lhoran**: So you can see that quartz pieces.
**Lhoran**: This thicker piece shown here.
**Lhoran**: And then we have a work surface on the opposite side.
**Lhoran**: So again, this is as you're coming in the door, you see this side.
**Lhoran**: This is the work surface side where you would have someone sit in a chair.
**Lhoran**: We have that at 2 foot 6 or 30 inches off the ground, which is a typical work surface height.
**Lhoran**: And then you have that quartz piece that's shown here that's coming over the top for your transaction counter and kind.
**Tkussow**: Of wrapping the back.
**Lhoran**: So as you think about that looking at the front, you can see that layout here.
**Lhoran**: And then your desk does.
**Lhoran**: Your reception desk does angle.
**Lhoran**: So we're going to follow.
**Lhoran**: We have that quartz wrap again going partially around.
**Lhoran**: We're going to wrap that and have it viewed aj dropped off.
**Lhoran**: We're gonna.
**Lhoran**: This is viewing this side now.
**Lhoran**: So we have that quartz wrap, that partial wall clad and a plastic laminate and then a base below if required.
**Lhoran**: And we'll talk about that on the design development.
**Lhoran**: Your pendant lights, which these are only shown for reference.
**Lhoran**: These are not the actual light fixtures.
**Lhoran**: This is being shown on this portion.
**Lhoran**: Again, as you're, you know, walking in and seeing that reception desk on the back side here.
**Lhoran**: So this is view 11.
**Lhoran**: This is viewing this side.
**Lhoran**: We have that work surface and then the quartz transaction top that drops down and then open space below.
**Lhoran**: Viewing it from view 12.
**Lhoran**: Similar layouts.
**Lhoran**: You have a part partial transaction top here and then this is open beyond.
**Lhoran**: So thinking someone who's sitting here, their monitors would probably be something like this, not to scale, but just to show you for reference.
**Lhoran**: And then that's that section view to convey what our construction method is preferred on that.
**Lhoran**: Any questions?
**Lhoran**: I know.
**Lhoran**: We'll talk about the finishes as we go.
**Lhoran**: For your reception desk.
**Lhoran**: Any questions for that?
**Mlehman**: So the actual on that we've highlighted the quartz wrap on that one arrow that goes down to the actual desk.
**Mlehman**: Is that quartz for the desk?
**Lhoran**: That should be a plastic laminate.
**Lhoran**: That just might be a quartz edge.
**Lhoran**: We'll have that as plastic laminate.
**Tkussow**: Sorry, that's our mistake.
**Lhoran**: And if it's helpful, that's that little.
**Mlehman**: Color sample you gave.
**Mlehman**: It's just a solid color.
**Lhoran**: Yep.
**Lhoran**: I can show you.
**Lhoran**: I'll go ahead and pull up the design development on the adjacent screen so you can see.
**Tkussow**: What our intent is.
**Lhoran**: So these are finishes.
**Lhoran**: Not.
**Lhoran**: This is not a true representation of the elevation.
**Lhoran**: The elevation is shown on this side of my screen.
**Lhoran**: But that's that quartz top.
**Lhoran**: That's the plastic laminate that is below.
**Lhoran**: So here.
**Lhoran**: And then this is the desk counter.
**Tkussow**: In a plastic laminate.
**Bwertz**: I think again what we'll review it.
**Bwertz**: Probably in charge.
**Bwertz**: My gut thoughts on this originally is especially in this view.
**Bwertz**: I don't know why we wouldn't just take the cords to the wall versus dropping it down there.
**Bwertz**: I mean, if I'm thinking if someone's working there, their monitors are there.
**Bwertz**: How messy is that?
**Bwertz**: Going to look at that opening versus just taking it to the wall.
**Bwertz**: Sure.
**Bwertz**: On a kind of same thing.
**Bwertz**: Maybe I'm just being too much of a miser.
**Bwertz**: Sorry.
**Bwertz**: Let me know when you're done with this one.
**Bwertz**: The other view where Brad was asking about the courts and yet where it wraps back around.
**Bwertz**: If you can zoom in.
**Bwertz**: Wrapping at the top makes sense.
**Bwertz**: Wrapping down the back.
**Bwertz**: I'm trying to figure out what is the cost of that versus no one's going to see it.
**Bwertz**: It's going to be behind monitors.
**Bwertz**: It's going to be behind.
**Bwertz**: If it's just as easy to kind of stop it at a.
**Bwertz**: At the top and not drop it down that I just trying to.
**Lhoran**: Yep, we'll probably have it.
**Lhoran**: It'll overhang a little bit just to help with that transaction time and that transition between.
**Lhoran**: But we can stop it there.
**Bwertz**: Overhead makes sense.
**Bwertz**: But against one of those.
**Bwertz**: Where are we paying for courts?
**Bwertz**: When.
**Bwertz**: Sure.
**Bwertz**: When no one's gonna see it.
**Lhoran**: Yeah.
**Lhoran**: And our thought there was just.
**Lhoran**: If you look at it from a floor plan view, you really see you actually have people going to the back of your reception desk, which is a little bit different from other projects we've done.
**Lhoran**: So you do have people kind of, you know, working their way to a conference room behind the person sitting at reception versus, you know, there being more of a, you know, a wall here and no one goes back there.
**Lhoran**: So that was our only intent is to make all sides of that more of a, you know, higher level finish.
**Lhoran**: But I totally understand what you mean.
**Tkussow**: It being behind, you know, computers.
**Tkussow**: So we can definitely remove that and.
**Bwertz**: Then that view right there.
**Bwertz**: I know that, I know it's not this a section cut at the very end of it, but is the end of the decks desk going to have like a.
**Bwertz**: I'll call it a modesty panel or something else that.
**Bwertz**: That hangs down there?
**Lhoran**: Oh, we can add that for sure.
**Lhoran**: Like on this side.
**Bwertz**: Yeah.
**Bwertz**: Again, I'm just picturing, again, I'm not sure what.
**Bwertz**: I haven't seen what Kristen stores there, but I gotta imagine, you know, I don't know if her purse sits on the floor or something else, but at least kind of gives an ability to.
**Bwertz**: To put stuff there without, you know, everybody looking at it.
**Lhoran**: So, of course, one of the questions I had for you all is we don't show.
**Lhoran**: Have any storage shown in this space.
**Lhoran**: Sometimes for clients, if they're not doing it through like a mobile pedestal or furniture on the area you're talking about.
**Lhoran**: So if we extend this quartz all the way over on the front side and then we do your modesty panel below.
**Lhoran**: Sometimes we have people do what's called a box.
**Lhoran**: Box file.
**Lhoran**: So they'll have kind of a box and then they'll.
**Lhoran**: Or they'll have a box on top which is two sets of drawers, you know, split evenly.
**Bwertz**: Let us see what Kristen has.
**Bwertz**: Yeah, let's see what Kristen has.
**Bwertz**: Now, I don't recall that being there, but again, I don't spend all the time behind there and also want to look and see because I think she also has like an in out box or something out like a mailbox thing that she sets on the desk area where the top isn't.
**Bwertz**: So it kind of makes me wonder, that waterfall, do we stop it a little shorter to provide.
**Bwertz**: Again, I'd like to get her input as to how she uses that even though it's hers.
**Lhoran**: Yeah.
**Bwertz**: It's still also used for other things.
**Lhoran**: Of course.
**Tkussow**: We.
**Lhoran**: We typically like to include the people who actually sit at that desk and use it most often because we want to get all their requirements in this construction phase and not an afterthought.
**Lhoran**: So definitely let us know or if we need to jump in on that.
**Tkussow**: Conversation, we're happy to conduct that meeting as well.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Lhoran**: Anything else related to reception desk and Then if not, we'll jump over to.
**Tkussow**: Our finishes and design development.
**Bclymer**: Okay, we'll go ahead and hop over here.
**Lhoran**: Okay.
**Lhoran**: So as most of you know, Emma dropped off some finishes today.
**Lhoran**: So what we're going to be talking about, you should have most of them.
**Lhoran**: The ones that are remaining or that are coming, we'll get those to you as soon as they're to us and we review them.
**Lhoran**: All of the finishes, which I'm going to send you in this digital presentation, including lighting, are all linked so that you can click on each of these pictures and see the product in greater detail.
**Lhoran**: We typically find the design development package.
**Lhoran**: While it's great to see the images and everything on one page, sometimes it's helpful to kind of zoom through those.
**Tkussow**: Install shots or look at the product details.
**Lhoran**: So for your reception, our design intent here is to have that darker plastic laminate below with the quartz shown above.
**Lhoran**: This quartz is really pretty, and I believe Emma dropped that sample off.
**Lhoran**: And if not, we'll get it to.
**Tkussow**: You as soon as possible.
**Lhoran**: It has a blue undertone, which we think helps helps with incorporating some branding and just some overall, we call this personality.
**Lhoran**: So to have something with some larger grain on it is going to show.
**Tkussow**: Really well in your reception area.
**Lhoran**: Lighting above, we have three pendant lights shown kind of in this more architectural style.
**Lhoran**: These are not to scale.
**Lhoran**: This is just to show intent here.
**Tkussow**: And I have those pulled up to see.
**Lhoran**: These are in a black finish.
**Lhoran**: And again, these are just to add an accent and to dress up kind of your reception desk area.
**Lhoran**: Any of this, you.
**Lhoran**: I know because this is the first time you're seeing some of this.
**Lhoran**: You're welcome to review and then we can update at a later time.
**Bwertz**: Yeah, well, we'll review.
**Bwertz**: My.
**Bwertz**: My first gut thought is no, just because we have the applied logo behind it.
**Bwertz**: And so I guess I don't know how low those are going to go, but it kind of defeats the purpose of having a logo behind the.
**Tkussow**: Sure.
**Bwertz**: Behind the reception.
**Bwertz**: If you got to look through the lights.
**Lhoran**: Yeah.
**Lhoran**: We'll let you confirm on those.
**Lhoran**: These are not very big.
**Lhoran**: Again, these are more pendant, so I would imagine if they're sitting smaller, you know, they're like.
**Tkussow**: Right.
**Lhoran**: Justified, you know, in that corner.
**Lhoran**: So because your sign sits further back, if we're thinking about it on plan view back on this wall, it's not directly, you know, those lights aren't directly in the.
**Lhoran**: In the way there.
**Lhoran**: So definitely something you can talk about internally and then decide.
**Lhoran**: Not a problem.
**Lhoran**: To wait on those for your lvt, we're working with some coordinating colors of what you have existing.
**Lhoran**: We like this one because you can kind of see it has a little bit of a stylized detail in it with this kind of metallic piece at an angle, which we thought was really interesting and kind of dressed up your reception and compared to your other open office area.
**Lhoran**: So just something to, again, just give a little bit of character to your reception area.
**Lhoran**: And then we have an accent wall covering shown just to help bring some of those darker colors in which I know you have in your existing space.
**Lhoran**: One of the things that of course you can talk about is a location for that your reception is really open and has a lot of transitions between other rooms without closed doors.
**Lhoran**: So depending on where you want to put that, maybe that only goes on this signage wall.
**Lhoran**: You know, you have a couple options for that.
**Lhoran**: So we can talk about that once.
**Tkussow**: You all review the finishes.
**Lhoran**: And if we need to make those changes or have a later meeting after you kind of digest the design development.
**Tkussow**: We can talk about that as well.
**Mlehman**: That wall covering, that's different than the wall covering sample that you sent over.
**Lhoran**: We sent you two.
**Lhoran**: So you should have one for your conference room, and then you should have one for reception.
**Lhoran**: And I can let Emma comment.
**Dmacari**: Yeah, I'll pop in real quick.
**Dmacari**: That is one of the finishes that we were unable to get at the time.
**Dmacari**: So the wall covering finish that you were seeing right now is going in the conference room, and as soon as we get that other wall covering, I will swing by and drop that off for you.
**Mlehman**: Okay, well, that explains it.
**Lhoran**: So those are for you to review again with your existing finishes in your space to digest those changes and what that would be.
**Lhoran**: We are, you will not hurt our feelings.
**Lhoran**: We're open to constructive criticism on how to change these and make them better for you so you don't have to love them right away, but it's just something for you to see in person and to help, you know, look at.
**Tkussow**: That with your existing finishes.
**Lhoran**: So I would say after you guys review those internally, maybe we're.
**Lhoran**: I can follow up after this meeting.
**Lhoran**: We can have an action item to set a meeting to review how those.
**Tkussow**: Finishes were perceived in your new space.
**Lhoran**: For your conference room.
**Lhoran**: We are showing a carpet tile that has a slight geometric pattern.
**Lhoran**: And again, you can click these product images and see some install shots of those to help convey the install versus just one install image.
**Lhoran**: These do come in some other colors if you want to do incorporate colors.
**Lhoran**: But for your wall coverings, this has a slight Blue slate, blue undertone with the geometric pattern on top in a smaller format.
**Lhoran**: And you can kind of click it to see it here.
**Lhoran**: We thought this was would be really nice on your TV wall.
**Lhoran**: So if you're looking at the floor plan, I would run this across the whole thing just to kind of dress up that.
**Lhoran**: That front wall in your conference room slightly.
**Lhoran**: And again, all of these are following the product, the pricing guidelines that we put forth for you previously.
**Lhoran**: For the casework for your conference room, we have that darker plastic laminate and the plastic laminate countertop.
**Lhoran**: This lower plastic laminate matches your reception desk.
**Lhoran**: So helping pull and tie those darker finishes together.
**Lhoran**: And then this plastic laminate countertop here has just a little bit more color variation and kind of a stone pattern to it, which you can see.
**Lhoran**: So just again, to dress up that area a little bit for you.
**Lhoran**: And then a general paint throughout the.
**Tkussow**: Rest of your conference room.
**Lhoran**: And as a reminder, your lighting is all recessed and can lights for your break room, we have just an image of an existing flooring.
**Lhoran**: It's for reference only.
**Lhoran**: It's not the exact product similar to your casework below.
**Lhoran**: So this is just to help convey colors and design intent across working with existing and new.
**Lhoran**: Your new countertop is again, that kind of plastic laminate textured stone look just to kind of help pull some other colors and patterns other than a wood that is like your floor, your casework.
**Lhoran**: We want that to be a little bit different.
**Lhoran**: For your plastic laminate island and countertop.
**Lhoran**: We think it's best if we do this in a solid gray below so that we are not trying to match back as close as we can to your existing casework and look like we missed, we think that would just feel off.
**Lhoran**: So doing it in this solid gray color, but with the same plastic laminate countertop from your existing casework that we're redoing for a new countertop, pulling it in here, those will help tie those pieces together and make them look cohesive without matching identically for your tile backsplash.
**Lhoran**: Again, optional.
**Lhoran**: So you can review that and you can click on the link to look at install images of that as well.
**Mlehman**: How high up does the backsplash go?
**Lhoran**: It will go from.
**Lhoran**: If you're looking at your elevation.
**Lhoran**: This is just an example.
**Lhoran**: So say this was your kitchen.
**Lhoran**: It would go from your lower cabinets to your upper cabinets.
**Lhoran**: So it would cover this area.
**Mlehman**: The two feet.
**Mlehman**: Okay.
**Lhoran**: And yours might not be two feet.
**Lhoran**: Again, this is in the mail and copy.
**Tkussow**: So this is just.
**Tkussow**: I'm showing it to you for reference.
**Lhoran**: Yours might be 18 inches or 19 inches, but that would be the intent there.
**Lhoran**: Okay, moving on to mail and copy.
**Lhoran**: So we're going to pull that same LVT from your reception into the mail and copy area to make that a seamless transition between those two areas.
**Lhoran**: Again, since it's not a door and it's more of an open walkway, the casework below, we think it'd be nice to do this gray plastic with this plastic laminate countertop.
**Lhoran**: We are leaving.
**Lhoran**: You can.
**Lhoran**: I think you can tell by the design intent.
**Lhoran**: We're leaving these dark wood tones kind of dressed up in your reception and your conference room for those areas.
**Lhoran**: And then the other areas that are more general use are this gray plastic laminate.
**Lhoran**: And then Emma dropped this off today and actually verified while she was on site, if for some reason Alito cannot find the existing carpet tile that runs in your open office in this area and they can't pull it through here.
**Lhoran**: We found a good alternate option that we have linked if we need to.
**Tkussow**: Do new carpet if the original spec isn't found.
**Tkussow**: So that's the reason for this page.
**Lhoran**: Okay, that's the end of our design development.
**Lhoran**: So I think we've covered everything on my meeting agenda today.
**Lhoran**: Are there any questions that I can help answer?
**Lhoran**: Now, I know the applied team still needs to get together and review some things and talk about some items, but overall, are there any questions I can help answer while we're all together?
**Dmiles**: I don't have any other questions.
**Dmiles**: Thanks for the running us through it so nicely.
**Lhoran**: Oh, absolutely.
**Lhoran**: Well, I know it's.
**Lhoran**: I know it can be a little.
**Tkussow**: Maybe not boring, but not the most.
**Lhoran**: Riveting part, you know, flipping through all the pages.
**Lhoran**: But it's good for all of us to kind of talk through design and construction intent now so that we can get a most finished document over to the leader group so that they can.
**Tkussow**: Use that for further construction.
**Lhoran**: So definitely beneficial.
**Lhoran**: But I know there still needs to be some review on other people's ends, so this can be a edited document as.
**Lhoran**: As needed.
**Bwertz**: Yeah.
**Mlehman**: Appreciate that.
**Mlehman**: Did a good job.
**Lhoran**: Thank you.
**Lhoran**: Okay, well, to wrap it up in summary, we will do the revisions that we have noted today that we have direct direction on, and we will make sure that all of those are captured on our end.
**Lhoran**: There are a couple things that, again, the applied team is looking through, so we will wait to issue a final construction set until we have more information on that.
**Lhoran**: Just because we have found in the past to have multiple drawings with dates dates floating out on site can cause some confusion.
**Lhoran**: So the intent is we're going to get all of those revisions captured at one time.
**Lhoran**: We'll let you all review the design development.
**Lhoran**: And again, if we need to set up Lauren or Brad or whoever, when whoever from applied, if it's Mark and Dan, need to be looped in on this when they get back from vacation in a week or so.
**Lhoran**: If we need to set up a future meeting to talk about that, Emma and I are welcome to come out to you or come to our office.
**Lhoran**: Whatever would be most helpful for that.
**Dmiles**: Okay.
**Lhoran**: Okay.
**Lhoran**: Well, if there's nothing else, I appreciate everyone's time and attention and reviewing and we'll work on those revisions and I will send out just some follow up items and things we need from everyone in order to get these going.
**Lhoran**: And if it's helpful, I'm more than welcome to send our redline set too just so that you can see follow up items.
**Lhoran**: But I'll try to make a list.
**Tkussow**: Of those for everyone.
**Tkussow**: Great.
**Dmiles**: Thank you.
**Lhoran**: Okay, well, thank you everyone.
**Lhoran**: Have a great day.
**Bwertz**: Thank you.
**Jdawson**: Thanks guys.
**Tkussow**: Bye.
