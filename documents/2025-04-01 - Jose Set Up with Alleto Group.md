## Transcript
**Jmendez**: Should I join if.
**Fnjie**: I don't know if she wants to join.
**Accounting**: I mean, me, should I join or only Fatima?
**Jmendez**: No, you should.
**Fnjie**: I mean, he's a new accountant person, so I'm pretty sure he has questions with you guys.
**Jmendez**: Brandon is also joining.
**Accounting**: Okay, okay.
**Jmendez**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: So, hi, Fatima, you're there.
**Fnjie**: And I think we're missing Jose.
**Fnjie**: So Jose is a new accountant person.
**Jmendez**: Okay.
**Jmendez**: So I'm not sure if, to be honest with you ladies, I don't know if there's like an onboarding type of thing.
**Jmendez**: I don't know if he has to go to some of the platforms you use or anything.
**Jmendez**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: So not sure.
**Jmendez**: So I just know that he wants to introduce the team like you guys.
**Jmendez**: You know, like, Fatima is a controller accountant.
**Fnjie**: And then Fritz is also doing.
**Fnjie**: Also from accounting, too.
**Jmendez**: And then Brandon, I think he's going to let him know exactly what he has to do because to be honest with you, I have no idea.
**Jmendez**: We just want to introduce a team so he has an idea like who needs to reach out or et cetera.
**Jmendez**: And then Fatima, after this call, I'll call you right away.

**Bclymer**: Are you trying to call him from this meeting?
**Fnjie**: So, yeah, so he needs to join.
**Jmendez**: But I don't have a phone to.

**Fnjie**: I think I am.
**Fnjie**: I'm texting him right now.
**Fnjie**: I'm seeing you guys too, just to make sure.
**Fnjie**: But I don't know.
**Fnjie**: One second.
**Fnjie**: How can I.
**Bclymer**: And he's the Same time zone as you, right?
**Fnjie**: I think so, yeah.
**Jmendez**: Okay.
**Jmendez**: If I'm not wrong, he's from El Salvador.
**Jmendez**: I think so, yeah.
**Jmendez**: Or I don't know if he's from Argentina.
**Fnjie**: We'll check.
**Jmendez**: We'll check.
**Fnjie**: But he accepted it, so.
**Fnjie**: Okay, one second.
**Fnjie**: I'm starting to make sure that I can't share peace.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: Let's see.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: I send it to him.
**Jmendez**: We'll see, though, if he doesn't connect.
**Fnjie**: Well, I mean.
**Jmendez**: Sa.
**Fnjie**: Okay, guys, five minutes more.
**Fnjie**: If not, I'll just schedule, I think.
**Jmendez**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Or just send us a message if he responds, and I can.
**Bclymer**: We can hop back on.
**Bclymer**: I have a little bit of time before I hop on my next meeting, so.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, or I can I.
**Bclymer**: For another four minutes and see if he shows up.
**Jmendez**: Yeah.
**Jmendez**: If you want to talk to me during the meeting before he joins about what you wanted to talk or.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, that's fine.
**Bclymer**: So for the payroll, the spreadsheet, since you're already dealing with Angela and the girls, do you want us to just let you know when the timesheet is ready and you just send it to them?
**Bclymer**: That way they deal with one person.
**Jmendez**: Yeah, you can send to me if you want to, and then what I can do is just copy you just to make sure you guys are also, you know, like, on the.
**Jmendez**: I know you guys are super busy with other clients, but just to make sure that you are also, you know, like, we did send that.
**Jmendez**: You know, like, accounting did send it.
**Jmendez**: So.
**Jmendez**: Yeah, if you want to send them to me on.
**Jmendez**: Yeah, whenever you have them ready, I will send them right away to Angela.
**Jmendez**: And then that's it.
**Jmendez**: And.
**Jmendez**: And, yeah, and then that'll be to units.
**Bclymer**: And then I know.
**Jmendez**: And then I know we have payroll.
**Jmendez**: Yeah.
**Jmendez**: I mean, Angela is the best one.
**Jmendez**: And then you can send it to Rita, too.
**Jmendez**: So I'm just gonna CC you ladies.
**Jmendez**: So you are also on the.
**Jmendez**: Look.
**Jmendez**: That's it?
**Jmendez**: Just to make sure everything is fine.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: Because last time Fritz sent a message to Angela, we.
**Bclymer**: We never got a response.
**Bclymer**: So maybe she's not used to seeing that.
**Bclymer**: That email.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Jmendez**: Gotcha.
**Jmendez**: Makes sense.
**Jmendez**: Okay.
**Jmendez**: Don't worry about it.
**Jmendez**: So send.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jmendez**: And then we'll just make sure that everybody is receiving their right amount.
**Fnjie**: Yeah.
**Jmendez**: Okay.
**Jmendez**: Perfect.
**Jmendez**: Fatima.
**Jmendez**: Thank you for that.
**Accounting**: And also, Maria, we are already working with the timesheet and the notion.
**Jmendez**: Right.
**Accounting**: Because Brandon had told me yesterday that he will not be approving the spreadsheet.
**Accounting**: We will be implementing the notion.
**Jmendez**: Yes.
**Jmendez**: So I know that from the timesheets you guys are using from the spreadsheet.
**Jmendez**: It's going to be Notion.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Jmendez**: That's what Brandon wants like to have the time sheets and notion.
**Jmendez**: So what we can do after.
**Jmendez**: What we can do after that once that's set up.
**Jmendez**: So the thing is that I've been as writing Megan about it and I think you also sent an email, Fritzy, to Megan, but we haven't received any response yet.
**Jmendez**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: Yes.
**Jmendez**: So I'm just trying to reach out to her to see if she can once that set it up, just enter it on Notion again, let me know is ready and then I will download the timesheet on Notion as a spreadsheet and I send it to Angela and.
**Bclymer**: Send it to them.
**Bclymer**: Okay, that sounds good.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: That way Brandon approves it in Notion.
**Fnjie**: Yeah.
**Jmendez**: But that's still taking time.
**Jmendez**: So I'll let you know if Megan can help us with that.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Jmendez**: Because she hasn't respond yet, so.
**Jmendez**: And that's going to take time because it's for each employee, right?
**Accounting**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Jmendez**: But it's.
**Jmendez**: It's just.
**Bclymer**: It's not a lot of employees and.
**Accounting**: The template is the same.
**Accounting**: The same format?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, the same format.
**Accounting**: It's just that you have that drop down of the project and then.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: She just needs to add the project list and just everybody, everybody's template is the same.
**Jmendez**: Oh, okay.
**Jmendez**: Makes sense.
**Jmendez**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: If she can do it, I'll try.
**Jmendez**: To set it up but fast with Notion.
**Fnjie**: So.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah, I think if she can do it, they can start using it.
**Bclymer**: Using it by the end of the week.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Jmendez**: And I think actually you don't have to do it.
**Jmendez**: I mean if the timesheets are on Notion, the guys can actually set it up.
**Fnjie**: Right?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, well, well, I think Megan will set it up and then assign it, assign it to them.
**Bclymer**: That way they go in every week, they do their timesheet just like the credit card.
**Bclymer**: They have it assigned to them already.
**Bclymer**: They enter the code in, they enter the timesheet.
**Jmendez**: Okay, perfect.
**Jmendez**: Yeah.
**Jmendez**: Okay, well I'll check with you ladies if she was able to.
**Jmendez**: Okay.
**Jmendez**: This guy didn't connect, so.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jmendez**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, we'll just hop off.
**Jmendez**: Just.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, just shoot me a message if he responds and if we need to get back on.
**Jmendez**: I think we need to reschedule, but.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Jmendez**: Okay, I'll let you know.
**Jmendez**: Guys, thank you so much for your time for joining ladies.
**Jmendez**: I appreciate that so much.
**Accounting**: Thank you.
**Bclymer**: Bye Bye.
**Bclymer**: Thank you.
**Accounting**: Get awesome.
