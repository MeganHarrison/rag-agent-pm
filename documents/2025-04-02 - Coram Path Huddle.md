## Transcript
**Whall**: Hey, Willie, can you hear me?
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I can.
**Speaker 1**: How are you?
**Whall**: Good, good.
**Whall**: Hey, I'm in the truck right now.
**Whall**: I'm getting ready to pull into my office.
**Speaker 1**: Is it okay?
**Whall**: I'm gonna.
**Whall**: I'm gonna hop off and hop back on in like two minutes.
**Speaker 1**: Yep.
**Speaker 1**: That's good with Here.
**Speaker 1**: Good here.
**Whall**: All right.
**Whall**: Sw.
**Whall**: Okay.
**Whall**: Can you hear me, Willie?
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, yeah.
**Whall**: How are you doing?
**Speaker 1**: Pretty well.
**Speaker 1**: How are you?
**Whall**: Good.
**Whall**: Good.
**Whall**: So Coram deo, it's been a long, long time coming for them.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, yeah, it's been a process.
**Whall**: I've been.
**Whall**: I've been working with them on and off for.
**Whall**: Since even I was at my old company.
**Whall**: So it's been.
**Whall**: It's been five to six years.
**Whall**: You know, originally we had been looking at building a new building, looking for a plot of land, and they found the.
**Whall**: The portion in Carmel and they were going to do a big remodel and, you know, funding didn't end up the way they thought it would be.
**Whall**: So on and so forth.
**Whall**: So that being said, I'm not sure.
**Whall**: So did.
**Whall**: Who did you work with to get the.
**Whall**: This first path design done at Coramdale?
**Whall**: Do you remember?
**Speaker 1**: The first person was Matthew.
**Speaker 1**: Matthew Simpson or something.
**Speaker 1**: Samson or something like that at.
**Speaker 1**: At Coram Deo at Coramdeo.
**Whall**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Which he apparently is not there anymore.
**Whall**: I don't think he is.
**Whall**: No.
**Speaker 1**: Rich Taylor is how I first got the introduction to him.
**Whall**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: And then.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So then I worked with Matthew Simpson or Samson, and we didn't do.
**Speaker 1**: There's no design.
**Speaker 1**: We.
**Speaker 1**: We did some survey work.
**Whall**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Well, actually, I will.
**Speaker 1**: I'll take that back.
**Speaker 1**: The lines that were shown on there, we pulled the plat or pulled the.
**Speaker 1**: What we could find, and then we just drew back in over GIS lines.
**Whall**: Okay.
**Whall**: For Rideway, is that this right here that I'm looking at?
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Whall**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Yep.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: And this was just.
**Speaker 1**: This was thrown together to get them a special use variance.
**Whall**: Right.
**Speaker 1**: And they had to show that they were building path around the.
**Speaker 1**: Well, the two sides shown and then sidewalk on 117th or whatever that is down.
**Whall**: Yeah, right here.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So that was done again to get their special use variants.
**Speaker 1**: But we didn't go out and do any design on the path itself.
**Speaker 1**: And we didn't shoot Topo or Right.
**Speaker 1**: Grade out the path at all.
**Speaker 1**: It was just a 2D site plan for them.
**Whall**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: So then.
**Speaker 1**: Then they went silent for a long time.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: We didn't.
**Speaker 1**: I thought the thing was dead, honestly.
**Speaker 1**: And then what.
**Speaker 1**: What's her name?
**Speaker 1**: Susan.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Then Susan reached back out not that long ago and said hey, planning.
**Speaker 1**: Said we got to get our path build or so many, so much of our path built.
**Whall**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: In a certain amount.
**Speaker 1**: Oh yeah.
**Speaker 1**: John Crabtree had talked to him as well.
**Whall**: Cool.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Whall**: So, so here's my understanding and I, I spoke with the city with a couple people so they got approved for this variant.
**Whall**: So essentially they can do it in three parts.
**Whall**: They can do.
**Whall**: And it's my understanding after communication with them that you know, this would be part, part one, part two, part three.
**Whall**: It doesn't really matter.
**Whall**: It's just these are the dates they have to have them complete by.
**Whall**: And so four twenty four hundred and twenty five foot along one seventeen that'd be this concrete as you know.
**Whall**: And then this portion and then this portion.
**Speaker 1**: So.
**Whall**: I'm under contract to do this for them and included in my price I have like a surveying number and hopefully enough to basically use that money for you guys.
**Whall**: The issue is Willie and that's why I want to hop on a call.
**Whall**: They don't have any money so if we have to go do a bunch more design like they can't, they can't afford it essentially outside of what.
**Whall**: And so when I, that's why I was, I asked the city if this would be sufficient and they, so they say I have an email that this should be fine as long as we pull the right permits.
**Whall**: Right.
**Whall**: And so I guess what I was saying is I have money for you to come in and do the surveying and do what work you need.
**Whall**: I just, we need to figure out exactly what more we need, I guess.
**Whall**: And that's.
**Whall**: I was curious what, what you've worked in Carmel more than I have.
**Whall**: So yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So I chatted with, with Brad Pease who's yeah, we do a ton of work up there, but I chat with Brad, Brad Peas not, not too long ago.
**Whall**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Told them the same thing that with time constraints and, and, and just finances on the project or whatever that them doing the traditional route of doing a design, getting it approved and then bidding it out or whatever to a contract, I'm like they just don't have the time to do that.
**Speaker 1**: And this is kind of before I guess I knew what, where you guys were fully involved or not.
**Whall**: Right.
**Speaker 1**: And, and so they went back and thought about it and, and Brad said he's like well I'm okay with doing a design build but since it's going to be in a ride away, you know, he wants to feel comfortable with, with either who's doing it and we went, this is on the heels of, we've done a couple, couple million dollar design, build trail projects for them here recently.
**Whall**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: That went pretty well.
**Speaker 1**: So I said well you know, we can, we can be out there and we can help lay it out and, and do, do some of the layout, follow the standards that I know they're going to want to adhere to and all that stuff.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Speaker 1**: And then just do, do some, do some inspection.
**Speaker 1**: And and he said that that was, that was, they were good with that.
**Whall**: So, so, so is it like.
**Whall**: I know every municipality is different, but does Carmel not come and do their own inspection or they just have a third party do it or they do both.
**Speaker 1**: So we do a ton of inspection for them.
**Whall**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: They do have their own inspection for, for private site development work.
**Speaker 1**: But it's just they, they're, you know, they run, they run back and forth.
**Speaker 1**: So what they would probably do is work on the site if you're doing parking lots and that kind of stuff.
**Speaker 1**: They would have one of their internal inspectors come out and check it out.
**Whall**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: But otherwise most of the stuff done in the right away they have consultants do a lot of their inspection.
**Whall**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Public works right away improvements.
**Speaker 1**: So.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, so what we had talked to Susan about was and then the other thing that comes into play here is Brad did confirm to me and then I pass this along to Susan is that he would want the right away because right now there's not sufficient right away.
**Speaker 1**: There needs to be right away dedication on college and on Congressional.
**Whall**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: So the fully thoroughfare.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Speaker 1**: The fully developed thoroughfare right away has to be dedicated.
**Speaker 1**: So we did go back and find there's two different surveys because there's two parcels on the property.
**Whall**: Uhhuh.
**Speaker 1**: We did find Alta surveys.
**Speaker 1**: We, we did some research and we found Alta surveys for both of them.
**Speaker 1**: Boundary surveys.
**Speaker 1**: So we have largely what we need.
**Speaker 1**: But we would, we would need survey wise we would need to go back out and pick up some property corners so we can tie the survey down to the property and then we need to do some class and descriptions for the right of way dedication.
**Whall**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Then.
**Speaker 1**: Then the sit between the city and corm Deo.
**Speaker 1**: Well, or the land owner, the leaser, they would put the front end documents together and get the right away dedication transferred over to city.
**Speaker 1**: We would then have enough survey work also done that we could stake out the right away for you guys.
**Whall**: Okay, cool.
**Whall**: So you could do the staking for me too?
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Whall**: Yeah.
**Whall**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: I assume that we just really needed right away stakes put out and then we would go out there with you.
**Speaker 1**: Pretty minimal time commitment.
**Speaker 1**: But go out there with you and.
**Speaker 1**: And lay it out and.
**Speaker 1**: Because there are going to be.
**Speaker 1**: You know I looked around and I told Susan like we didn't.
**Speaker 1**: You know this, this site plan wasn't prepared based on topo survey.
**Speaker 1**: If you look on Street View I'm like there's utilities, there's you know there's some hydrants, there's some.
**Speaker 1**: It's some stuff that you're gonna have to work around.
**Speaker 1**: Yep.
**Speaker 1**: So anyway.
**Speaker 1**: So that's kind of the process that we were expecting.
**Speaker 1**: But yeah.
**Speaker 1**: She told me the same thing that you know they don't have a lot of money.
**Whall**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So what I had anticipated I need to go back.
**Speaker 1**: I think it was between survey and then there's Pl.
**Speaker 1**: We got a couple different plats of descriptions that we have to do.
**Whall**: Huh.
**Speaker 1**: For the right of way docs.
**Speaker 1**: And then I was allotting like 10 grand or something like that for just staking right away laying out path with you a couple weeks of part time running out and doing some inspection as well of the work that you guys do and all that.
**Whall**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: I think I had like 15,000 maybe total between the survey, the right of way plastic descriptions.
**Speaker 1**: The yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Now again if that's part of it though was like how far are you going to construct?
**Speaker 1**: Because I didn't know how much I plan on constructing and how far go.
**Speaker 1**: And how long is that?
**Speaker 1**: Is that a week versus 30 days?
**Speaker 1**: If it's a week then we don't have as much time probably on the inspection.
**Speaker 1**: So that can go down a little bit.
**Speaker 1**: It's just right.
**Speaker 1**: I didn't have a lot of knowns yet.
**Whall**: Right.
**Whall**: Right.
**Whall**: Yeah.
**Whall**: They asked me to kind of meet with you and just like they don't know what they're doing.
**Whall**: Right.
**Whall**: I'm a builder.
**Whall**: I really.
**Whall**: And then so we're a design build company and I, I just told him, I said I'll meet with Willie, see where he's at on his pricing and then.
**Whall**: And then come of show you where I'm at on what I plugged.
**Whall**: So for my three parts.
**Whall**: So let me pull this up here.
**Speaker 1**: Path.
**Whall**: So they had 90 grand basically allocated this, this, this see which one is this?
**Whall**: So this is the 810 foot along North College and my pricing came in at 87886 and then here is.
**Whall**: Here is the 600 foot on congressional and this one does include for we have to do.
**Whall**: I guess from what I saw here we have to have an ADA ramp.
**Speaker 1**: Right?
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Whall**: So, so I included for the ADA ramps on that one.
**Whall**: So.
**Whall**: So really this first phase we're either going to do this or this and I think we do this because they, they can't really afford right now doing these heavy duty drives.
**Whall**: Ea and what I included for.
**Whall**: For surveying is tell you here.
**Whall**: And this is a budget number.
**Whall**: So basically I was hoping that with this.
**Whall**: So I have 5,000 in there for this one.
**Whall**: This is the wrong one which I know it wasn't going to be enough.
**Whall**: I.
**Whall**: I figured around 15 to 20k across all three of them basically really is what I plugged.
**Whall**: And so it's, it's.
**Whall**: It's more a matter of what do we need to get the design across the finish line and then, and then the three parts of it basically three mobs.
**Whall**: Right.
**Whall**: So this year, next year and the following year.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So that's.
**Whall**: And I may be a little light.
**Whall**: So we have like a couple thousand to work with I guess to.
**Whall**: To get it across the finish line.
**Whall**: But yeah, yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So yeah so I guess where I would be at is.
**Speaker 1**: Okay and I can get you this broken down here.
**Speaker 1**: My survey manager's out this week.
**Speaker 1**: But here's what it is, you know to go out there do the field work to pick up the property corners and such so that we can tie down the existing boundary surveys that we can reestablish the boundary surveys that are there so that we can do the right of way class and descriptions.
**Speaker 1**: And here's what it is to do the right of way passing descriptions and those would be hard number.
**Speaker 1**: And then here's what it is for.
**Speaker 1**: Here's an estimated budget for right away staking.
**Speaker 1**: Because part of it is like do you want to.
**Speaker 1**: Well we would only stake out I guess one phase of the right of way or one portion of the right away staking right now instead of staking the entire property because that's going to be I guess over three years worth or two years worth of construction.
**Speaker 1**: So right.
**Speaker 1**: We could.
**Speaker 1**: Here's what it would be.
**Speaker 1**: This is you know, one trip, one day staking.
**Speaker 1**: So this is what it would be to stake out this right away.
**Speaker 1**: Here's what.
**Speaker 1**: And then here's what.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah what is your time to do like this phase.
**Speaker 1**: And then we.
**Speaker 1**: I can give you like here's my.
**Speaker 1**: Our estimated budget for layout with you guys, construction layout to work with you in the field to do that to coordinate with the utility if we have to to coordinate with the city to you know, do that Kind of stuff.
**Whall**: I basically had one week of.
**Whall**: Of.
**Whall**: And I'm probably pretty light on this.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Whall**: You know, the dumpsters are for.
**Whall**: For cutting out asphalt on them wherever.
**Whall**: And then I had just have like a week for one of my project managers on it.
**Whall**: So 40 hours basically allocated.
**Whall**: And that's per phase.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: All right.
**Speaker 1**: And that's kind of what.
**Speaker 1**: One of our.
**Speaker 1**: One of my guys that does a bunch of the work up there for us, inspection wise, was like.
**Speaker 1**: He was like, man, this should be like a week, you know?
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So, I mean, I can get you a more refined number based on that.
**Speaker 1**: Of like.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, here's what.
**Speaker 1**: Now that I know.
**Speaker 1**: So your hope would be to do this stuff on College Avenue?
**Whall**: I think so.
**Whall**: I mean, it's either the stuff on college or.
**Whall**: Oops, sorry.
**Whall**: Yeah, it's either gonna be.
**Whall**: I, I think.
**Whall**: I think we need to do the stuff on college.
**Whall**: Yeah.
**Whall**: Because I don't want to have to do this concrete, and concrete's expensive.
**Whall**: Now.
**Whall**: I, I only went to two different guys.
**Whall**: I think we can get that number lower, and I've told them that.
**Whall**: But their biggest fears, they just need to get a portion of it done.
**Whall**: So the asphalt's the easiest one.
**Whall**: You know, this.
**Whall**: This portion here, we're just tying in.
**Whall**: Right.
**Whall**: And then, you know, I'll have a guy in a skid steer out there a day cutting everything out, getting it to grade, and then we'll come in with stone and paver and just be done.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Whall**: So.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, no, I agree that.
**Speaker 1**: That college is probably the easiest of the path construction.
**Speaker 1**: Unfortunately, the most beneficial would be Congressional.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Speaker 1**: To tie.
**Speaker 1**: Tie in the dry.
**Speaker 1**: You know, kids bike into school or whatever gets them to the parking lot and all that.
**Speaker 1**: I mean, it would, it would be more beneficial.
**Speaker 1**: But I, I agree.
**Speaker 1**: We were going to.
**Speaker 1**: And I don't know if Curtis has or not.
**Speaker 1**: We were going to stop because again, those drive approaches.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, that was.
**Speaker 1**: I.
**Speaker 1**: That was just by looking at street view and everything.
**Speaker 1**: And I don't know if the existing is ADA compliant.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Speaker 1**: That was one of the concerns.
**Whall**: I don't think they are.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So that was kind of why we have to reconstruct that anyway.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Speaker 1**: So I agree that's going to be more expensive and more time consuming.
**Speaker 1**: So.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, well, so what I'm.
**Whall**: So give me the price for, for what we talked about.
**Whall**: And I definitely going to need your help, like getting through with the city.
**Whall**: And if they're more comfortable knowing that you guys are involved in the project, that, that, that Would help a lot because I've only talked with.
**Whall**: I'm on a thread with Mike Hollenbaugh, Caleb Warner and John Thomas, and then Angie Khan.
**Whall**: So.
**Whall**: And that's just because their names were on the letters.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So, yeah, John's your stormwater guy, and Caleb's the right away permits guy and Mike.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Mike's the director of planning and Angie's the planner.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Whall**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, so Brad Pease is a guy that I've been talking to because he's the.
**Speaker 1**: Which he's relatively new city engineer there.
**Speaker 1**: They, you know, they control that right away construction and they.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, so that's kind of why I talked to him.
**Speaker 1**: And again, a lot of this was.
**Speaker 1**: I.
**Speaker 1**: I wasn't sure.
**Speaker 1**: You know, Susan called of the blue, started asking us like, so what do I need to do to design this?
**Speaker 1**: And I was like, well, okay, we need to fit it in our schedule.
**Speaker 1**: We got to do.
**Speaker 1**: And then she was like, well, we got $90,000 and we have to have it built by.
**Speaker 1**: I thought she told me June or something.
**Speaker 1**: And I was like, well, August 1st.
**Whall**: Is our date, so we definitely need to get rolling on it.
**Whall**: But okay.
**Whall**: I'm doing some interior stuff for him too.
**Whall**: I'm gonna go out there and look probably next week or something.
**Whall**: I told him that you and I were gonna huddle today and get a game plan for moving forward, but they're definitely.
**Whall**: Yeah, they.
**Whall**: They called in a.
**Whall**: They definitely need some guidance from us.
**Whall**: So.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, that.
**Whall**: That being said, I told him I.
**Whall**: I'd get with you.
**Whall**: We'd be on the team.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Whall**: Working together to get this done.
**Whall**: I just told him I can handle all the contracting.
**Whall**: That way we're paying you, right, Instead of them paying you, Willie.
**Whall**: But like I said, I'm not pretty open book with these guys, so you feel free to send me your proposal with them attached to it, as well.
**Whall**: But.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I will.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: What you'll see for me is a number for.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, sorry, survey.
**Speaker 1**: I would.
**Speaker 1**: I would plan on survey and our right away engineering.
**Speaker 1**: The plastic descriptions being like lump sum.
**Speaker 1**: Here's what they are per each, you know, description or whatever.
**Speaker 1**: Here's what it is for the survey work.
**Speaker 1**: And then right away.
**Speaker 1**: Or construction staking right away.
**Speaker 1**: Staking would be like, here's.
**Speaker 1**: Here's our rates.
**Whall**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Here's our estimated budget to stake out this right away over here.
**Speaker 1**: And, you know, it's a day, right.
**Speaker 1**: Or something like that.
**Speaker 1**: And you know, with drive time and stuff.
**Speaker 1**: So.
**Speaker 1**: So that will be like an estimated Budget and then the same thing with the, you know, kind of a layout part time, part time inspection with you guys working with you guys in the field, say.
**Speaker 1**: Yep.
**Speaker 1**: Hold it here.
**Speaker 1**: No move up here, grade this down, you know, that kind of stuff.
**Speaker 1**: Work with you and then again some time to talk to the city and that kind of stuff.
**Speaker 1**: And it's only a week.
**Speaker 1**: Here's what our, we think our time is, but again, it's just if you need more or less, you know, it could fluctuate a little bit.
**Speaker 1**: So.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, but that's what I'll.
**Speaker 1**: That's what you'll be getting from me.
**Whall**: Super helpful.
**Whall**: Yeah, I know they'll be excited to actually get some stuff done.
**Whall**: They've been, it's been a.
**Whall**: Yeah, they've had a lot of turnover too.
**Whall**: And, and now Dave Cyl, their headmaster, is gone.
**Speaker 1**: So they have.
**Whall**: So Jason's the new headmaster.
**Whall**: He's a great dude and they're just ready to, to quit talking about it and just start getting it done, so.
**Speaker 1**: Getting it done.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, Y.
**Speaker 1**: No, I can, I can appreciate that.
**Speaker 1**: Well, and that's.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: I wondered if, you know, with each, like each one of these phases, is it going to be kind of the same way where they're only going to have so much money to.
**Whall**: Well, so I gave him a price.
**Whall**: So I'm, I'm like at 88, 000 for this one, 87 for this one including an ADA ramp.
**Whall**: And I'm sorry, this is all the concrete one.
**Whall**: All in all it's around, you know, 300, 000 now.
**Whall**: If we were able to do it all at once, that number would go down.
**Whall**: But I have, you know, three mobes in there and so on and so forth.
**Whall**: So it's.
**Whall**: Yeah, I don't know what, I don't know what the funding is going to look like.
**Whall**: They, they have high hopes for next year, but we'll, we'll see.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Well, hopefully they, hopefully they can handle it so that they grow and fundraise and all that.
**Whall**: Okay.
**Whall**: Unfortunately, they don't really have a choice.
**Whall**: They have to get the path stuff done.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Whall**: Or their variance is going to go.
**Whall**: Go away.
**Speaker 1**: So go away.
**Speaker 1**: Which is.
**Speaker 1**: No, no good.
**Speaker 1**: I will if.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: If you can give me a minute.
**Speaker 1**: So like I said, our survey manager's out.
**Speaker 1**: I want to get the number from him on the survey.
**Speaker 1**: So is Monday or, you know, beginning of next week all right?
**Whall**: Monday's fine.
**Whall**: I think that we're just gearing up to start this, you know, school's out in May.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Whall**: Into May.
**Whall**: So if we.
**Whall**: If we can do this anytime in June, I think we're good.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: All right.
**Speaker 1**: All righty.
**Speaker 1**: And then as far as.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, as far as the proposal.
**Whall**: Do.
**Speaker 1**: You want me to title that to you?
**Speaker 1**: So everything will go through you guys?
**Whall**: That.
**Whall**: That's fine.
**Whall**: That's fine.
**Whall**: Yep.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: All right, sir.
**Whall**: Alrighty.
**Whall**: Willie, I appreciate it.
**Speaker 1**: Hey, no problem.
**Speaker 1**: And, yeah, you'll see something for me early next week.
**Whall**: Yeah, that works.
**Speaker 1**: I appreciate it.
**Speaker 1**: All right.
**Whall**: See you, man.
**Whall**: Yeah, nice to meet you.
**Speaker 1**: You as well.
**Whall**: By.
