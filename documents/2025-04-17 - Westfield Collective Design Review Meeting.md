## Transcript
**Bclymer**: They barely do when you get up.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: On this outside plate, there's like three of them.
**Bclymer**: Two outside, one does go to the final latch and one does the.
**Bclymer**: So you're going to use bar flat instead of.
**Jdawson**: Skin.
**Jdawson**: Is last couple of guys on here.
**Nbigler**: What are we doing?
**Jdawson**: I was just on the phone with Nick.
**Jdawson**: I'm trying to get him.
**Jdawson**: Get him on.
**Jdawson**: On this call.
**Jdawson**: And then Joe from jqol, it's the last person we're waiting on, I think here.
**Nbigler**: Okay, well, let's go ahead and they could be on the phone or whatever.
**Nbigler**: Like, let's, you know, what's.
**Nbigler**: What are we starting with first?
**Jdawson**: Like, is there starting with civil?
**Jdawson**: But Ashton's gone anyways.
**Jdawson**: So Civil Citizens has a sanitary permitting.
**Jdawson**: They've approved the stamp drawings.
**Jdawson**: Waiting on the admin team to send us a link.
**Jdawson**: And for some reason they take up to 14 business days to send a link for payment.
**Jdawson**: And so we were waiting to start sanitary until we get that permit.
**Jdawson**: Here's Joe here.
**Jdawson**: Citizens Water and Gas is still under review.
**Jdawson**: Ashton sent back the last three comments that they had.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: Was it Tuesday?
**Jdawson**: So once they review, it'll go through the same process.
**Jdawson**: Go through the admin department so we can pay for that and start with our water and gas.
**Jdawson**: And then I is complete.
**Jdawson**: Ashton's waiting on them to send him their permit.
**Jdawson**: Structural design is the main topic for our meeting today.
**Jdawson**: So essentially we got ag peers coming up on the 28th, so two Mondays from now, and they need their submittals back and approved by next Wednesday.
**Jdawson**: So in order to do that, we need to address the additional columns that are in the Barco Prudence shop drawings, steel shop drawings, find out if they're going to remain, if they're going to shift, and then address the added footers and ag peers.
**Jdawson**: So, Joe, you're on here.
**Jdawson**: I have the submittal ready from CNC that I was going to send you guys today.
**Jdawson**: I don't know if that's you or Jerrica that wants to look at it, but I would say you've done everything per the current foundation.
**Jdawson**: Settle.
**Jdawson**: It doesn't seem like anything there is going to shift.
**Jdawson**: It would just be possibly adding a few columns and if so, would you guys just be able to mark that up and send it back to them so they can get their submittal approval back on time?
**Awoodhams**: Yeah, I believe that's right.
**Awoodhams**: Send that to me and copy Jerrica and we'll just get that.
**Awoodhams**: We'll get any additional whatever.
**Awoodhams**: Just compare what we've got with what they're sending, we'll mark it up and just send it back.
**Awoodhams**: It sounds like.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Nick advised that his detailers and, and stuff, they're in today, they're out tomorrow for good Friday and they'd be back in Monday.
**Jdawson**: So it's realistically Monday, maybe Tuesday morning before they would be able to, you know, make changes on the mezzanine and the column locations and check the reactions to see if we need to keep, keep the column at the beer.
**Jdawson**: At the beer wall.
**Jdawson**: You know, that's one that was a clash that wasn't added.
**Jdawson**: So the, the drawings coming back Tuesday morning would just give you guys that last couple things to, to be able to, to put in there to get back to CNC by Wednesday.
**Jdawson**: So that's the, that's the.
**Bclymer**: Wait a minute for.
**Nbigler**: Let me understand this.
**Nbigler**: We have columns that were not shown on our, our drawings originally.
**Nbigler**: We got random columns that were thrown in there.
**Nbigler**: I assume it's probably because they were behind and I was on their ass to rush and it's a mistake.
**Nbigler**: What I don't understand is why we would be looking and saying, oh well, the columns might have to remain.
**Gdesmit**: Yeah, can you hear me?
**Nbigler**: Yes, Nick, we can hear you.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Gdesmit**: Yeah.
**Gdesmit**: So I talked to Varco Prudent about it and their project coordinator said, I am not sure exactly why those columns were added.
**Gdesmit**: We're gonna figure it out.
**Gdesmit**: That was the response I got.
**Nbigler**: Where, where is the.
**Nbigler**: Glenn, where is the shop drawings at that we're referencing from.
**Nbigler**: From Varco Prudent or, you know, Nick, whatever.
**Nbigler**: Do we have them saved in a folder or are they on.
**Jdawson**: Oh, oh, on our computer?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah, it's in, it's in the permit set of drawings and it'll be unstructural.
**Nbigler**: Okay.
**Nbigler**: Is it a job planner or how are we distributed these?
**Jdawson**: I have not put, I've not put these steel drawings in the job planner yet.
**Jdawson**: I don't.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, they are in Job planner.
**Gdesmit**: Can we pull up that sheet that Jeff had marked up?
**Gdesmit**: It's probably the easiest one maybe to look at.
**Nbigler**: Yeah.
**Nbigler**: Where's that sheet live?
**Jdawson**: That's under permit set and just at the bottom of the folders as clash markups.
**Nbigler**: Gotcha.
**Nbigler**: Okay.
**Gdesmit**: Alright.
**Gdesmit**: So the beer wall, right?
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: So this is the beer wall at the D3 column is the one that was added here.
**Jdawson**: So this is our first window, second window, third window of the kitchen, of the, of the kitchens.
**Jdawson**: And then here's our beer wall, here's our bathrooms.
**Gdesmit**: And then I have to figure out what Varco Pruden did on the other side of the mezzanine on line B.
**Gdesmit**: And if that has to do with supporting the stair, even though they say the stair is self supporting or why those two columns were added and why they're off center.
**Gdesmit**: So.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jdawson**: So I have the stair supplier, you know, you know, support the legs and we want them to be at the, in at the front of the landing, closest to the front door.
**Jdawson**: And then there's a reception desk kind of tucking in under there.
**Jdawson**: So these, these columns aren't supposed to be here at all.
**Gdesmit**: Have you defined what the load is that we need to take on that landing?
**Gdesmit**: Or sorry, not on the landing, but on the top where our slab starts.
**Jdawson**: Where the stairs connect.
**Gdesmit**: Yeah.
**Gdesmit**: Where they actually attach to the mezzanine.
**Gdesmit**: Do we know what load needs to be accounted for?
**Jdawson**: I, I don't.
**Jdawson**: I can ask.
**Jdawson**: But again, there's, there's being self support and we'll have a thickened slab here at the bottom.
**Jdawson**: And then we'll have the two support legs at the landing.
**Jdawson**: At the front of the landing.
**Jdawson**: Weld them to the.
**Gdesmit**: So they are self supported.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Angle.
**Jdawson**: No load, no load.
**Awoodhams**: Well, it sounds like if they're connecting to the mezzanine, there will be a load.
**Gdesmit**: I mean, that has to be something, right?
**Nbigler**: Well, I think what, what we're saying is.
**Nbigler**: And this is what you need, we'll get with our stair guy to confirm because if they're saying it's self supporting, then that means the down force load may not be a reaction.
**Nbigler**: Now you're going to have a load on the x axis, essentially because it's going to be moving in some direction.
**Nbigler**: Now I imagine that load is, is very small, but there would be some load.
**Nbigler**: I just would, I would think that if, I mean, because essentially that's cantilevered out, I would think it has some downforce load.
**Nbigler**: So we will confirm that right after this call and get.
**Nbigler**: And look at that and see exactly what that is.
**Nbigler**: Because it's.
**Nbigler**: I'm sure it has a little bit.
**Gdesmit**: Yeah.
**Nbigler**: Load on there.
**Bclymer**: Sure.
**Gdesmit**: I'm sure the first questions, you know, hey, can we eliminate those columns?
**Gdesmit**: They're gonna say, okay, hey, how much is that stair gonna weigh?
**Gdesmit**: What's the force on that beam?
**Nbigler**: Right.
**Nbigler**: Because.
**Nbigler**: Because essentially that stair, it has about halfway up two columns.
**Bclymer**: Sure.
**Nbigler**: And so it's just a matter of like, is that accounting for, I guess, you know, essentially a cantilever out.
**Gdesmit**: Okay, Glenn.
**Awoodhams**: I doubt they would be accounting for that.
**Nbigler**: Right.
**Nbigler**: I, I would agree with you, Joe.
**Nbigler**: That's why I think.
**Awoodhams**: Is the stair.
**Awoodhams**: Is the underside of the stair going to be exposed or will it be enclosed exposed?
**Awoodhams**: Okay.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah, I.
**Awoodhams**: I'll bet dollars to dirt they're planning on connecting that to the mezzanine because they're going to need that to help.
**Awoodhams**: They're going to need the mezzanine to help stable stabilize the stairs as well.
**Awoodhams**: So it'll take some gravity load and it'll take some kind of stability load.
**Awoodhams**: So they need to just verify that.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah, yeah.
**Gdesmit**: And then do we know the width?
**Gdesmit**: Glenn, didn't you say it got narrower?
**Jdawson**: No, these are eight feet, actually.
**Gdesmit**: Eight feet wide, centered in the opening.
**Gdesmit**: Right?
**Nbigler**: Correct, Correct.
**Nbigler**: Zoom in right there.
**Nbigler**: There's your.
**Nbigler**: You just missed your detail.
**Ashton**: If you look at the actual.
**Ashton**: That's the other one.
**Ashton**: Go back one more.
**Ashton**: The stringer to stringer.
**Nbigler**: Right there.
**Nbigler**: Enlarged.
**Nbigler**: Zoom in.
**Nbigler**: So eight and a half is inside and outside is three inch.
**Nbigler**: Three inch.
**Nbigler**: Eight, two and a half.
**Nbigler**: Yeah.
**Gdesmit**: So that's the dimension I need to use.
**Gdesmit**: 8 foot 2 and a half centered.
**Gdesmit**: So stairs are not self supporting.
**Gdesmit**: And you guys are going to define the load that I need to assume.
**Gdesmit**: Yes, as soon as you can.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Nbigler**: All right.
**Gdesmit**: Please make that happen.
**Gdesmit**: That would be very helpful as I talk to vp.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we're gonna do that all on all the stairs then, not just these mezzanine.
**Jdawson**: Right?
**Nbigler**: Yeah, well, the, The.
**Nbigler**: The other stairs, I, I believe are an issue as far as load.
**Nbigler**: He's already accounting for that.
**Gdesmit**: Well, it says self supporting on the one next to line 15.
**Nbigler**: Yeah, yeah, but you've got a column, column, column, column, column.
**Nbigler**: So it.
**Nbigler**: You've got.
**Nbigler**: The issue is with the one inside is we want to eliminate those two columns outside.
**Nbigler**: Those columns all look fine.
**Nbigler**: Correct, Jeff, it's just a matter of the location.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Ashton**: I mean, if those columns are needed to support the beam framing, then I don't see how we can get rid of them.
**Ashton**: Right.
**Gdesmit**: Yeah.
**Ashton**: Yeah.
**Ashton**: The only problem here was where the.
**Ashton**: The outer.
**Ashton**: That beam 36.
**Ashton**: That was.
**Jdawson**: Jeff, do you want to share your screen?
**Jdawson**: That, that little.
**Jdawson**: That clash view that you were showing us the other day?
**Ashton**: Yeah, give me a second.
**Ashton**: I gotta get it.
**Nbigler**: Yeah, the.
**Nbigler**: The beam 56, 55, 54, 53 is the ones.
**Nbigler**: And then, you know, column D3 all around there is.
**Nbigler**: Not sure why that would be there.
**Gdesmit**: Because we had to create the opening for the actual stair.
**Gdesmit**: So you have to do that and frame it out of all beams.
**Gdesmit**: And those beams need to stop with columns, you know, catching them.
**Ashton**: Right.
**Jdawson**: It's Just not wide.
**Jdawson**: This opening is just not wide enough to fit the stairs.
**Jdawson**: You'll see with Jeff show.
**Jdawson**: So we either need to.
**Ashton**: Yeah, here we go.
**Jdawson**: Pull these back.
**Ashton**: Yeah.
**Ashton**: So originally, this stair was farther in, and there was, like, a section of, you know, metal and.
**Ashton**: Or basically the stair opening was cut out of the slab.
**Ashton**: And when we discussed kind of how this opening worked, our understanding was that we didn't want to do that detail.
**Ashton**: And so we pulled it all the way to the outside so that we could eliminate this extra piece.
**Ashton**: So I guess what we just need to determine is with the rest of the columns here that are holding up the rest of this framing, can this go away?
**Ashton**: Can this be pulled back to here?
**Ashton**: And if not, that's fine, but we just need to move the stair in one foot two.
**Ashton**: Two.
**Ashton**: That's.
**Ashton**: That was our dimension.
**Ashton**: It was a little over one foot one.
**Ashton**: And we're like, okay, we don't want to miss it.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Ashton**: So we'll just move it in one foot two.
**Ashton**: So the stringer would clear this.
**Bclymer**: Beautiful.
**Gdesmit**: The opening size is correct.
**Gdesmit**: It just needs to shift over 1 foot 2 or 1 foot 2 narrow.
**Ashton**: Yeah, it.
**Ashton**: The opening size, like, all the, like.
**Ashton**: Well, I guess, no, the opening size isn't correct because there's.
**Ashton**: There's no, you know, there's no concrete on.
**Ashton**: On this edge.
**Ashton**: Right.
**Ashton**: This is just an extra piece of steel.
**Ashton**: So the opening would need to move that far in so that the stringer would clear this the way that it's drawn.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Ashton**: Now, this railing is aligned with this railing.
**Ashton**: Right.
**Ashton**: So it's, you know, so we just move it in, and it would.
**Ashton**: It would jog.
**Ashton**: If I go back to.
**Ashton**: Go ahead and share that markup again, Glenn.
**Ashton**: So what we were saying was is that if, you know, if that being 36, has to remain, then beam 56, 54, 53.
**Ashton**: Right.
**Ashton**: The ones that are framing out the stair opening, all those can.
**Ashton**: They just need to all get shifted over.
**Ashton**: Right.
**Ashton**: So it would affect beam 15.
**Ashton**: 15A and 53 would all change in length.
**Ashton**: Right.
**Ashton**: 15 would get shorter by, you know, 14 inches, and the other ones would grow.
**Ashton**: So.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay, I follow you.
**Ashton**: While we're looking at that real quick.
**Ashton**: I don't know if, you know, if we're going through this and kind of shifting stuff over, if there's the option on that stair to take beam 54.
**Bclymer**: Sorry.
**Ashton**: If you zoom back here, make sure.
**Ashton**: Yeah.
**Ashton**: Beam 54.
**Ashton**: Well, I guess you have to have something to hold the slab edge up.
**Ashton**: So I take it back.
**Ashton**: I was I was trying to figure out a way to get rid of that D3 column at the bottom of the staircase.
**Ashton**: But we got to have something coming across to hold the slap edge anyway, so.
**Ashton**: Right, we get it.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Ashton**: I mean, I guess the only thing you could do, Nick, is if we wanted to get rid of beam 53, you could pull beam 54 all the way down to column line L, and they're just not.
**Ashton**: Or that small section of slab.
**Bclymer**: Sorry, can't hear.
**Gdesmit**: So you're saying.
**Ashton**: Right, yeah, you can just get rid of that small section of slab there, and we'll just put the.
**Ashton**: We'll just modify the railing.
**Gdesmit**: So would it be easier just to eliminate beam 53?
**Ashton**: Yeah, that's the question.
**Ashton**: If you eliminate 53, then you can eliminate the column that's.
**Ashton**: That's attached to it and just run 54 all the way down and tee it into 11.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Nbigler**: Yeah, that would.
**Nbigler**: That would be ideal.
**Ashton**: It'd be cleaner, and it would get rid of the column at the bottom of the stairs.
**Nbigler**: Be way more cooler if you did that, Nick.
**Gdesmit**: I love being cool.
**Gdesmit**: I'm gonna see what I can do first.
**Nbigler**: Time for everything.
**Gdesmit**: Yeah, I know.
**Gdesmit**: All right, we got that one.
**Jdawson**: We talked about this one on the phone just a minute ago, Nick.
**Jdawson**: But yeah, with these stairs pretty much level with here.
**Jdawson**: And so this needs to be.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Gdesmit**: So right now, my total dimension.
**Gdesmit**: Can you scroll over to the left a little bit?
**Gdesmit**: Is 28 foot nine.
**Gdesmit**: Nine.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Gdesmit**: What does that need to be?
**Gdesmit**: It needs to be closer to what, like 23.
**Ashton**: I'm looking right now.
**Ashton**: Hold on.
**Bclymer**: Let's see.
**Ashton**: This is the right.
**Bclymer**: Which one is.
**Ashton**: Okay, so this the back set of.
**Ashton**: Wait a minute.
**Ashton**: I'm gonna look at the wrong thing here.
**Ashton**: So the back column, the one.
**Ashton**: Oh, yeah.
**Ashton**: You're looking at it there.
**Ashton**: Right.
**Ashton**: So the column that's in the back, the one that's in the middle of that mezzanine is on column line L.
**Ashton**: Right.
**Ashton**: So, yeah, so that D4 there, that's 11 foot 7 off.
**Ashton**: That's column line L.
**Ashton**: That's correct.
**Ashton**: So then if I do a dimension from there to the center line of the next one, it's 9 foot 11.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: It's about 10ft.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Gdesmit**: So you want that to be 9ft instead of 10ft.
**Ashton**: Well, always zoom out, though.
**Ashton**: Something's up.
**Nbigler**: That's.
**Nbigler**: That.
**Nbigler**: Doesn't that math?
**Nbigler**: Doesn't math.
**Ashton**: Yeah, no, I know.
**Ashton**: That's what I'm looking at.
**Ashton**: Go to the right where that other beam is.
**Ashton**: I guess what I'm Trying to figure out is why.
**Gdesmit**: Okay, so the whole dimension of the mezzanine out there is 22 foot eight currently.
**Gdesmit**: Right.
**Gdesmit**: That's from the volleyball building line out to line M or M1.
**Bclymer**: Right?
**Ashton**: No, that's.
**Ashton**: That's where the issue is.
**Ashton**: Oh, wait, you're.
**Ashton**: Are you talking about from which column line?
**Ashton**: If you're going from K or are you going from L?
**Gdesmit**: It's not really L.
**Gdesmit**: Gosh.
**Gdesmit**: It's not showing very well.
**Nbigler**: L.
**Nbigler**: L.1.
**Gdesmit**: Yeah, kind of L 0.1.
**Gdesmit**: The volleyball building.
**Gdesmit**: You know where the framed opening is there, 6 foot 4.
**Gdesmit**: There's.
**Gdesmit**: Oh, yeah.
**Gdesmit**: So right now, VP has it shown that the whole width is 22 foot 8.
**Gdesmit**: But you want that trunk to what?
**Ashton**: No, what I'm saying is I'm trying to figure out why there's.
**Ashton**: Why we're missing the steel framing.
**Ashton**: Like, they shouldn't be in a line like that.
**Ashton**: 28, nine.
**Ashton**: Okay, something.
**Ashton**: Let me pull that up, Gwen, and I'll.
**Ashton**: So I can kind of annotate what I'm seeing here.
**Ashton**: Hold on.
**Ashton**: That.
**Nbigler**: Because that d.
**Nbigler**: Let's see.
**Nbigler**: M1, L6.
**Ashton**: Here.
**Ashton**: Too many things going on the screen.
**Ashton**: Okay, so the issue that.
**Ashton**: That I'm seeing and I'm trying to figure out something is.
**Ashton**: Is up here.
**Ashton**: Right?
**Ashton**: Because from L to m.
**Ashton**: Right.
**Ashton**: Is 15.
**Ashton**: 9.
**Ashton**: That's correct.
**Ashton**: So this outer beam is the edge of the mezzanine as it comes across.
**Ashton**: But when we get to this point, the mezzanine comes back and then comes across because the stair is out here.
**Bclymer**: Correct.
**Ashton**: So what I'm.
**Ashton**: What we're not seeing is we're not seeing that jog right here.
**Ashton**: And what I think the issue is, okay, this.
**Ashton**: This wall right here should be back here at K.
**Ashton**: I think it was just drawn incorrectly.
**Ashton**: Right.
**Ashton**: So this whole set of items should actually be back here.
**Ashton**: Get that jog.
**Ashton**: So you're right.
**Ashton**: These distances.
**Ashton**: This 11 foot 7 and 10 foot are correct.
**Ashton**: But this 11 foot 7 should be from K, not whatever this line is.
**Ashton**: Right.
**Ashton**: Because these columns for the volleyball are on K.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Ashton**: We don't even have a k point one.
**Ashton**: So that's what the issue is.
**Ashton**: The dimensions are correct.
**Ashton**: It's just drawn in the wrong spot.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Ashton**: I'm assuming that this is not from the 3D.
**Ashton**: This is a 2D.
**Ashton**: Was this.
**Ashton**: Is this done in CAD or how does VP do these?
**Gdesmit**: I'm not sure.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Ashton**: So, yeah, so these two dimensions are correct.
**Ashton**: It's just that the 11, 7 is taken from K, not from this.
**Ashton**: Whatever this other Arbitrary line is here.
**Nbigler**: Is there, is there a way, Nick, I know that.
**Nbigler**: I mean, you're a functioning alcoholic salesman.
**Nbigler**: Is there a way that we can get on a call with the designer for whoever's doing the thing for Varco Pruden and then that way we can walk through this and you know, you can even be on the call.
**Nbigler**: Like we'll all get beers after.
**Nbigler**: It'll be great.
**Gdesmit**: Right?
**Gdesmit**: Well, I feel like that might need to happen for sure because I explain it really well, but that is really confusing how they have everything shown.
**Gdesmit**: They clearly say line K is the building line of the volleyball building.
**Ashton**: But yeah, these AR1s are not in the right spot.
**Gdesmit**: No.
**Nbigler**: Yeah, yeah, that should all bump that.
**Nbigler**: That, that L9, you know, should basically be like five foot off of M.
**Nbigler**: Yeah, yeah.
**Ashton**: All this should be right here.
**Nbigler**: So.
**Nbigler**: Yeah.
**Nbigler**: Is there a way that, you know, we can get that set up, Nick?
**Nbigler**: I mean, and.
**Nbigler**: Because that's what, what's going to run through all this.
**Nbigler**: Like, you know, we're kind of just saying stuff and then you've got you relying on you to go message it back to them and that it's just inefficient.
**Gdesmit**: Understood.
**Nbigler**: So is that something you're confident we can do or we need to walk through all this still?
**Gdesmit**: No, I think that we need to get off this, you know, not do it in this meeting and we will make it happen.
**Nbigler**: Okay, great.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Nbigler**: Okay, so let's, let's get that set up as soon as we can.
**Nbigler**: Yeah.
**Nbigler**: You know, Joe, do you.
**Nbigler**: Do you.
**Nbigler**: Or Jerrica, I think would probably be wise for you guys to be on the call or you do you agree?
**Awoodhams**: Yeah, I'm happy to sit in on that.
**Bclymer**: Sure.
**Nbigler**: Okay.
**Nbigler**: Appreciate it.
**Nbigler**: Yeah.
**Nbigler**: And then we'll.
**Nbigler**: We'll give everybody else their time back.
**Nbigler**: So what's.
**Nbigler**: What's next on the design agenda here, Glenn?
**Jdawson**: Next we got just elevator shop drawings are.
**Jdawson**: I'm going to send a revised one in.
**Jdawson**: Jerrica has anchor rods and the current elevator shops, they had a different.
**Jdawson**: They had an incorrect floor to floor travel.
**Jdawson**: So you guys should get some updated shops.
**Jdawson**: She was going to review all those simultaneously.
**Jdawson**: Last thing really, Joe, is we're trying to just determine the soil bearing pressure.
**Jdawson**: We sent an email to you, but I was hoping we can just get an answer on.
**Jdawson**: That's what I called you about earlier too.
**Jdawson**: So we're putting in the AG piers.
**Jdawson**: We're at the point right now where the soil is pretty wet out there.
**Jdawson**: So we had some proctoring done and Did a proof roll and we're determining if we're going to till it up and let it dry or lime stabilize.
**Jdawson**: And we're wondering if that's really required, necessary, considering we're putting AG peers under everything, grade beams and footers.
**Nbigler**: So Joe, to be specific, what the question is is, you know, the.
**Nbigler**: We had alt woods had come out there and the guy was just like stabilized, which that's just a buzzword, but in reality, if we go and we till 16 inches down or whatever the pad, then by the time we excavate to put in the grade beam and the footers, all that stabilized dirt is gone.
**Nbigler**: And so trying to figure out if that's necessary, especially since we're going to have aggregate piers down there below each footer.
**Awoodhams**: Right.
**Awoodhams**: So it sounds like to me, for workability, it sounds like to me the stabilization would be a workability during construction, like to maintain the site to keep it where you guys can get on it and do what you need to do.
**Awoodhams**: The what will support the building are the aggregate piers under the foundations.
**Awoodhams**: Right.
**Awoodhams**: So that you know how that sequence works.
**Awoodhams**: Whether the building pad is brought up and it's stabilized and then Geo Peer or whoever ends up putting in the aggregate piers comes in and drills down, rams those things in.
**Awoodhams**: And then you guys excavate the bottom of footing and then pour everything back up or if that's a different sequence.
**Awoodhams**: You know, I'm not sure the sequencing.
**Awoodhams**: It sounds like the sequencing.
**Nbigler**: The sequencing is going to be.
**Nbigler**: So we're gonna, we're gonna.
**Nbigler**: We're gonna leave the pad like at.
**Nbigler**: Let's use the volleyball.
**Nbigler**: Both buildings, the.
**Nbigler**: The at finish, you know, what.
**Nbigler**: What finished grade is supposed to be.
**Nbigler**: Now we know that we're going to excavate the volleyball later because we got to put the sand in.
**Nbigler**: But what we want to do is the concrete sub is going to use dirt as the forms.
**Nbigler**: And so sure, the Ag Pier guys will go down and they'll, you know, get it to whatever it needs to be.
**Nbigler**: And then when we excavate, you know, we'll just cut it off to where it's at the base of our footer.
**Awoodhams**: Right?
**Awoodhams**: Well, it sounds like to me, and that's what I would anticipate.
**Awoodhams**: It sounds like to me, the stabilization would be more of keeping the site, keeping site workable, like from a construction equipment standpoint and all that is what it sounds like from Alton Woodsig, because people do stabilize that sometimes they'll put down rock.
**Awoodhams**: But you're right, if you're going to come in and stabilize it, depending on how deep that is.
**Awoodhams**: And I don't know if it was cement stabilization or lime or what, but, I mean, that stuff can get pretty hard.
**Awoodhams**: It'll keep the site workable, whether or not.
**Awoodhams**: Whether or not it's necessary.
**Awoodhams**: It's not necessary for the building because the rammed aggregate piers are what's supporting the foundation.
**Nbigler**: Okay.
**Nbigler**: That was the biggest thing.
**Nbigler**: We'll.
**Nbigler**: We'll figure out the workability and how to get on it.
**Nbigler**: I just wanted to know from a structural standpoint, because the Alt woods guy, that doesn't.
**Nbigler**: Again, he didn't look at the drawings.
**Nbigler**: He doesn't know.
**Nbigler**: He's just like, it's Indiana.
**Nbigler**: It's old farm ground.
**Nbigler**: Stabilize it.
**Awoodhams**: Right?
**Ashton**: Yeah.
**Awoodhams**: And that's nine times out of ten, that's what.
**Awoodhams**: That's what folks will do.
**Awoodhams**: They'll either come in and stabilize it or they'll put a buttload of rock down to be able to keep the site workable.
**Awoodhams**: And they'll work through that to get down to the foundations or whatever.
**Awoodhams**: So it's just.
**Awoodhams**: That's.
**Awoodhams**: I mean, how you guys need and to function on the site, what you guys need to do to keep that workable, whether it's stabilization, additional rock or whatever, that is not a part of it.
**Awoodhams**: If we have rammed aggregate.
**Awoodhams**: Beers.
**Gdesmit**: Gotcha.
**Nbigler**: Yeah, we'll figure out the constructability part.
**Nbigler**: I just want to make sure we didn't need it for the structure.
**Ashton**: Yeah, no.
**Awoodhams**: And then I do have one quick question while I've got the floor.
**Ashton**: Just.
**Awoodhams**: Just so that I'm clear on the meeting with Varco Pruden and how that ties in with, like, the GEO peer stuff.
**Awoodhams**: Right.
**Awoodhams**: Or the rammed aggregate Peers are the piers.
**Awoodhams**: Is CNC the peer supplier?
**Awoodhams**: Is that.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Awoodhams**: Okay, great.
**Awoodhams**: All right, so then it's a little more clear.
**Awoodhams**: So this meeting with Arco Prudent will establish.
**Awoodhams**: We're going to kind of try to clarify and eliminate these conflicts or clashes and get their stuff lined out.
**Nbigler**: Correct.
**Awoodhams**: And we'll mark up our foundation plan to address that so we can quickly get that to CNC so that they can turn around the rammed aggregate submittal.
**Awoodhams**: Is that correct?
**Awoodhams**: That's the process.
**Jdawson**: I already have the submittal that I'm going to send you.
**Jdawson**: So everything is per your current foundation drawings.
**Jdawson**: They already kind of had it ready based on what we already discussed.
**Jdawson**: And then they just made a quick adjustment based on you guys updated CAD files the other day.
**Jdawson**: And now the only thing in question is, yeah, the.
**Jdawson**: Are we adding these Columns are they, you know, location and then we add.
**Nbigler**: Those are the foundation drawings that we have.
**Nbigler**: Do they match the architecturals or do they match Nick's drawings?
**Awoodhams**: The pre engineered metal building is what we match.
**Awoodhams**: Right now we've got thickened slabs and pads and stuff where we noted columns on the last anchor bolt layout.
**Awoodhams**: Anchor bolt column layout from Varco Prudent.
**Nbigler**: Okay.
**Awoodhams**: All right, so.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah, so we just need.
**Awoodhams**: It sounds like with that CNC submittal and pending, pending this meeting with Arco Prudent.
**Awoodhams**: We just need to coordinate how we mark up CNC's drawings.
**Awoodhams**: Right.
**Nbigler**: Correct.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Awoodhams**: Okay.
**Awoodhams**: Very good.
**Awoodhams**: Thank you.
**Jdawson**: For thick and slab at the.
**Jdawson**: At the top of the stairs.
**Jdawson**: These two columns are at the top of the stairs right here, which should actually be more like right here.
**Jdawson**: You're calling for a thickened slab on those stairs as well.
**Jdawson**: On the posts on the legs of the stairs, not just the base.
**Jdawson**: This is.
**Jdawson**: Sorry, this is the mezzanine and this is the mezzanine stair here.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah, that's correct.
**Awoodhams**: We had a thickened slab at the base and then thickened slabs or.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah.
**Awoodhams**: Foundation or for what we took to be post supporting the stairs.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Awoodhams**: So that there would be some planning for something there.
**Awoodhams**: Whether they're the stair people's posts at the landing or whether they're.
**Awoodhams**: I, I mean, I couldn't tell if there were columns at the, you know, wherever we thought there was a column, a load coming down to the slab, we put a thick and slab for those stairs.
**Bclymer**: Got it.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Ashton**: Yeah, I see where you're getting at, Brandon, because those, those two extra columns that are plan north.
**Ashton**: Right.
**Ashton**: Those would.
**Ashton**: Those aggregate peers would go away if we can get rid of them.
**Nbigler**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Which ones, Jeff?
**Jdawson**: Sorry.
**Ashton**: The two, the two that we wanted to eliminate up top that were like halfway between.
**Ashton**: In between, like at L.6.
**Ashton**: Those on.
**Ashton**: On either side.
**Ashton**: Those are the ones that, that we had crossed out in ours and said that we hadn't planned on.
**Ashton**: On those two columns.
**Jdawson**: Like these two here.
**Ashton**: Now the ones that are on the other side.
**Ashton**: Yeah, that one and the one on the opposite end side of the building.
**Nbigler**: All right, Nick or Glenn.
**Nbigler**: What.
**Nbigler**: What else is on the design engineer.
**Jdawson**: That was it.
**Jdawson**: We already discussed.
**Jdawson**: Jeff showed us clashes.
**Jdawson**: And Jeff, did you want to show the other clashes?
**Jdawson**: We had like some other stuff.
**Jdawson**: The, the overhead doors going through the joists was one.
**Jdawson**: We needed to kind of determine the height of those joists.
**Ashton**: Well, I think that that's only a clash right now because we don't have the full Depth list.
**Ashton**: So I guess.
**Ashton**: Nick, is there a possibility to get the full list of the joy steps so we can make sure that we don't have a clash at the overhead doors?
**Ashton**: Because right now we just use the.
**Ashton**: The 26 inch depth, which is what it said was, you know, max depth everywhere.
**Nbigler**: We max that out to have clearance.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Ashton**: So I guess we just need to know what all of the joy steps are, not just the worst case scenario.
**Ashton**: So we can make sure that we have enough clearance for the overhead doors because we know that they're going to be smaller.
**Ashton**: But until we know exactly what the depth is, we can't verify that.
**Ashton**: Think you're muted if you're trying to talk.
**Nbigler**: What I heard him say is.
**Nbigler**: Yes, he'll get us that.
**Gdesmit**: Yes, I will give you that.
**Gdesmit**: Okay.
**Gdesmit**: The max depth is going to be between line L and J.
**Gdesmit**: It's the biggest space.
**Ashton**: Right.
**Gdesmit**: But you're Talking more along 13.9 where the spacing is shorter.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Ashton**: So essentially the.
**Ashton**: Obviously it's basically anywhere where we have an overhead door.
**Ashton**: Right.
**Ashton**: So like the ones that we need to know are in between A and B and like A and B.
**Ashton**: B and D and F and J.
**Nbigler**: No, it's B.
**Jdawson**: B and D.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: There's a store here.
**Gdesmit**: Stay that way.
**Ashton**: Yeah, but we have the two doors out up front too.
**Ashton**: So like between A and B.
**Ashton**: Yeah.
**Ashton**: Then B and D and then F and J.
**Ashton**: Those are the depths that.
**Jdawson**: Oh, A and B.
**Jdawson**: This way.
**Jdawson**: Got it.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Ashton**: Yep.
**Gdesmit**: And you're requesting that between 12 and 10.
**Gdesmit**: You're requesting that the depth is not 26 inches.
**Gdesmit**: You need it to be at what?
**Ashton**: For it to work?
**Ashton**: Oh, well, I mean, based on the structural, you know, whatever they need to be.
**Ashton**: We just need to know what's the minimum depth that you guys can use in a large hoist in those locations.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Well, also, I mean, Jeff, we know that the doors that we called were 10, 10 foot.
**Jdawson**: So the track is at what, whatever 10 foot or 10 foot two.
**Jdawson**: The bottom of the joist needs to be above that.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Otherwise we have to make smaller doors.
**Ashton**: We raised everything up.
**Ashton**: Right.
**Ashton**: So if we had.
**Nbigler**: Yeah, we raised everything up to have that clearance.
**Ashton**: Yeah.
**Ashton**: I gotta do some mental math here.
**Ashton**: 12 6.
**Ashton**: So the joist bearing is a 12 2.
**Ashton**: So that means we have.
**Ashton**: I mean, we have 26.
**Ashton**: Right.
**Ashton**: Which is what we.
**Ashton**: So if we could get them to 20 inches, Nick, I think that that would be.
**Ashton**: That would give us, you know, six inches of clearance for the track and the do Glenn and hopefully that's enough.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: One thing, Jeff, when you were showing us the other day, we did the walk.
**Jdawson**: We went from the ice cream bar to the wine bar, and we looked at this garage door.
**Jdawson**: You had the joists running that way there.
**Jdawson**: But on the structural drawings says the joists run north, south.
**Ashton**: I'll go back and look at our model.
**Ashton**: They should be.
**Ashton**: They.
**Ashton**: They all should be right.
**Ashton**: I'll have to go back in and look.
**Ashton**: And if they're not, I'll make sure that they're turned.
**Jdawson**: Well, Jeff, we know they should be right, but so if they were going this way, you know, north, south, like it says on the mezzanine plan here.
**Ashton**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: Bardo is running this direction.
**Jdawson**: So in that case, we would just need to make sure the doors are between those joists.
**Jdawson**: But then it would affect these ones here because it would run in that way.
**Nbigler**: Those doors won't be between those joists.
**Nbigler**: Those joists are going to be like four foot or something.
**Ashton**: Yeah.
**Ashton**: They're two foot on center, so.
**Nbigler**: Two foot.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Ashton**: It doesn't really matter from a visual standpoint.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Here.
**Jdawson**: But I just wanted to point that out.
**Jdawson**: When you were showing the other day, it looked like you're.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we were looking at this door.
**Jdawson**: I think you had the choice.
**Jdawson**: Running the wrong way.
**Ashton**: Okay.
**Nbigler**: All right, what's.
**Nbigler**: What's next on our list here, Glenn?
**Jdawson**: Yep, I think that's it.
**Jdawson**: Gas and electric loads.
**Jdawson**: Deem is demon here.
**Jdawson**: They don't need to say anything.
**Jdawson**: Alex, Micah, how you guys doing?
**Jdawson**: Listening in team.
**Jdawson**: Do you need anything else at this point from Duke?
**Brhoades**: Not from Duke.
**Brhoades**: We're all good on that.
**Brhoades**: I think one thing that we were trying to figure out was how we're exactly going to mount the light fixtures on the second level.
**Brhoades**: I think we just need a detail of how the.
**Brhoades**: How the roof works.
**Jdawson**: Are you talking about the wall packs or.
**Brhoades**: No, I'm talking about, like, all the pendant or the.
**Brhoades**: The like, cylinders.
**Brhoades**: All the cans that we have up there.
**Brhoades**: Is there.
**Brhoades**: Is there, like, trusses or.
**Awoodhams**: Or.
**Ashton**: Yeah, there's.
**Ashton**: There's gerts up there and.
**Ashton**: Okay, I'm assuming you guys are just gonna have to use, like, completely blanking.
**Brhoades**: Like a pendant.
**Ashton**: Now.
**Ashton**: What's the un.
**Awoodhams**: Unistrut.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Ashton**: Thank you.
**Ashton**: Like, my mind went completely blank.
**Ashton**: Yeah.
**Ashton**: So, yeah, I think it's just gonna have to be unistrud that's attached to the.
**Ashton**: To the steel that's supporting the.
**Ashton**: The roof.
**Ashton**: And then all the lights are going to have to be attached to the unistrad.
**Brhoades**: Okay.
**Brhoades**: Okay, I'll get with Brennan.
**Brhoades**: I don't think.
**Nbigler**: Brennan is not on here.
**Brhoades**: I'll get with Brennan.
**Bclymer**: He.
**Brhoades**: He asked me that question and I said that's a really good question.
**Brhoades**: So we'll plan on that then.
**Jdawson**: Alex, do you know when.
**Jdawson**: When the trans transformer is supposed to be ready to go on site?
**Jdawson**: Something they have to order?
**Awoodhams**: I.
**Nbigler**: That.
**Brhoades**: I'm not sure.
**Brhoades**: I.
**Brhoades**: I know it's not a concern or anything, so.
**Brhoades**: So.
**Bclymer**: Okay, cool.
**Jdawson**: Last thing on the agenda is design deliverables.
**Jdawson**: We have most everything in.
**Jdawson**: So last couple things we are looking for.
**Jdawson**: Structural steel permit set was submitted.
**Jdawson**: Did that go to state yet?
**Jdawson**: Jeff or Nick?
**Jdawson**: I don't.
**Jdawson**: Whoever was going to send that and attach it to our cdr.
**Ashton**: Yeah, so the, The.
**Ashton**: The structural drawings that Nick sent are on the state portal.
**Ashton**: So right now.
**Ashton**: And I.
**Ashton**: Brandon, I think Dylan has been emailing you about it, but the last thing that is needed from a state standpoint, and I think Nick, you emailed about it this morning, is the final determination for the inspecting.
**Ashton**: The inspecting engineer for the PE&B drawings.
**Ashton**: And Joe, I don't know if you're looped in on that, but I guess.
**Ashton**: Brandon, I know that Jerrica and Dylan were discussing that with you.
**Nbigler**: Me?
**Ashton**: Yes.
**Nbigler**: I don't know squat about that.
**Nbigler**: You sure?
**Nbigler**: Somebody said something to me.
**Nbigler**: Let me sure it wasn't a different handsome guy.
**Gdesmit**: It wasn't me.
**Nbigler**: See what you did there, Nick?
**Ashton**: So I don't want to.
**Ashton**: Since Dylan's not on the call, I don't want to put words in his mouth, but he said that he had sent.
**Ashton**: He had talked to someone at Alito about their position last week.
**Ashton**: Was that.
**Ashton**: Glenn, was that you or was that branded about, you know, signing off on the metal cdr?
**Ashton**: Right.
**Ashton**: And apparently that had been discussed when they originally set up the scope of the project.
**Ashton**: That's just not in there.
**Nbigler**: Yeah, no, it's.
**Nbigler**: I agree it's not in their scope.
**Nbigler**: Nick's engineer should be signing that because they're the one that engineered it.
**Nbigler**: And then the foundations are what are in JQOL's stuff.
**Nbigler**: So I haven't talked to anybody since, but I know that's not right.
**Nbigler**: So I guess.
**Nbigler**: Are we having an issue with Varco's engineer signing this?
**Jdawson**: Nick?
**Gdesmit**: Yeah, they don't sign that in the state of Indiana.
**Nbigler**: So they're not licensed engineers in the state of Indiana.
**Gdesmit**: They are licensed engineers.
**Gdesmit**: Above that form or above that line, they fill out their Indiana license, engineer number, all that information.
**Gdesmit**: The person who designs the Foundations that support the metal building.
**Gdesmit**: That is what the state of Indiana wants to see on that green line.
**Gdesmit**: This is not the first project where this confusion has happened.
**Gdesmit**: I talked to Glenn about that.
**Gdesmit**: I know I probably alluded to that in emails.
**Gdesmit**: If I ordered fifth.
**Nbigler**: Joe, does that make sense to you?
**Nbigler**: This is, you know, I'm not, I'm not gonna act like I, I know this is new to me.
**Bclymer**: Sure.
**Awoodhams**: No, it's, I don't know that the state of Indiana requires the foundation.
**Awoodhams**: I mean, we would go out and do the inspection certainly for the foundation and stuff like that.
**Awoodhams**: But it's not also unsurprising that a pre engineered metal building manufacturer doesn't want to do the inspection.
**Awoodhams**: So whether it's their policy not to do it or whatever, that's something that I think we could do.
**Awoodhams**: I mean, we'd certainly do it for our foundation.
**Awoodhams**: Right.
**Nbigler**: Well, and the way I understand, I understand it from what Nick just said, and maybe I'm interpreting this incorrect, is it's not that Farco doesn't want to do it or can't do it or whatever, it's that the state, this application is not requesting them, they're requesting the foundation engineer.
**Nbigler**: Is that, am I misinterpreting that?
**Awoodhams**: Have our foundation.
**Awoodhams**: Was our foundation a part of this middle then or was that the steel.
**Nbigler**: Package for the state design release?
**Awoodhams**: Yeah.
**Gdesmit**: My, the way I understand it is that, no, this has nothing to do with the foundation.
**Gdesmit**: The person who basically sets the criteria for the metal building.
**Gdesmit**: You know, this isn't like, hey jqol, we are supplying steel and it's this size.
**Gdesmit**: You need to come out and inspect it.
**Gdesmit**: That's not what this line is saying.
**Gdesmit**: What this line is saying is, you know, you guys determine the occupancy, the wind speed, the building criteria.
**Gdesmit**: It's our job to size the steel based on that.
**Gdesmit**: But the person signing this form is the structural engineer who has been designing the foundations based on our reactions.
**Gdesmit**: It's not Varco prudent escaping any type of liability or hey, you need to go out and inspect this.
**Gdesmit**: I have, personally, I've never seen anyone go out and inspect our steel because they've signed this form or they.
**Nbigler**: Yeah, Joe, if you know the way that that's described sounds accurate because you guys designed the footers and everything for uplift, wind shear, all that stuff is tied to that.
**Nbigler**: That, that Right.
**Nbigler**: Makes sense to me.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah, we'll, we'll go out and we'll do, you know, certainly our inspections and stuff like that.
**Awoodhams**: I'll I'll verify with Dylan.
**Awoodhams**: I feel like there may have been an email sent out, but I'll have to get with.
**Awoodhams**: I'll have to verify that with Dylan and see what exactly the deal is.
**Awoodhams**: Well, certainly if we're due inspections, we'll.
**Awoodhams**: I mean, we've always done our inspections, so it's not that we're not going to do it for this.
**Jdawson**: So the email's pulled up on the screen right now here, Joe, if you want to see it.
**Awoodhams**: O.
**Awoodhams**: Oh, okay.
**Awoodhams**: Well, I'll have to get with Dylan because I'm kind of driving right now, and it's really small on my phone.
**Nbigler**: Yeah, we'll definitely get it worked out and then.
**Nbigler**: Yeah, let's look again.
**Nbigler**: It doesn't seem like.
**Nbigler**: I think what Dylan is thinking is that you guys have to come out and inspect steel and everything.
**Nbigler**: And from what I understand, you know, from this meeting, it's more along the lines of signing the engineer saying, hey, you know, you know, everything is designed to the standards, you know, based off my engineering requirements.
**Awoodhams**: Right.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah, we'll take a look at that and see what's.
**Awoodhams**: See.
**Awoodhams**: See what the deal is there.
**Awoodhams**: And Jeff, so for that cdr, Marco Pruden filled that out with the exception of the designated inspecting representative.
**Awoodhams**: Is that what I'm understanding?
**Gdesmit**: No, they're.
**Gdesmit**: They're waiting for you guys to sign the green line above the green line, and then once you do that, you send it to us because they've had people not.
**Gdesmit**: I'm not accusing anybody of this, but in the history, in the past, a lot of people will just say same as above.
**Gdesmit**: And that's.
**Gdesmit**: I don't know.
**Gdesmit**: So it's their, like, requirement that that's signed.
**Nbigler**: Oh, yeah, you can't vp.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Awoodhams**: Oh, the inspecting professional.
**Gdesmit**: Yeah.
**Ashton**: Correct.
**Ashton**: Okay.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah, no, the state won't.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah.
**Awoodhams**: Indiana won't let you do same as above.
**Nbigler**: That.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah, that won't fly.
**Awoodhams**: It needs to be filled out by somebody.
**Gdesmit**: So that's.
**Awoodhams**: I'm.
**Awoodhams**: I'm catching up here a little bit.
**Awoodhams**: But yeah, we'll.
**Awoodhams**: We'll get that worked out and I'll get back with you guys.
**Gdesmit**: Yep.
**Gdesmit**: Thanks.
**Gdesmit**: Let me know if you have any other questions, too.
**Bclymer**: Sure.
**Jdawson**: Cool.
**Jdawson**: Jeff, so you submitted your permit architectural, and you submitted the mechanical and plumbing when you did your initial CDR or acdr.
**Jdawson**: We have.
**Ashton**: Correct.
**Ashton**: I've uploaded Micah's.
**Ashton**: I've uploaded ours.
**Ashton**: I uploaded the ones from Nick that are the actual steel shops, and the foundation ones were uploaded a while back when the early foundation release was okay, so everything is up there, including.
**Jdawson**: What about electrical?
**Ashton**: Yeah, that one that was from.
**Ashton**: Well, no, Micah didn't do electrical, did he?
**Ashton**: No, Dean, but I'm pretty sure.
**Ashton**: Dean.
**Ashton**: I sent the number to Dean, so I think they did their own.
**Brhoades**: Yeah, we were submitting it on our own.
**Brhoades**: I think the permit lady.
**Brhoades**: I think she's getting done with it today.
**Ashton**: Cool.
**Jdawson**: Just send me a.
**Jdawson**: Send me a copy of that whenever you're done with it.
**Ashton**: Yep.
**Ashton**: And all the com check.
**Ashton**: Com check and the envelope.
**Ashton**: Com check are also up there.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So the.
**Jdawson**: You'll.
**Jdawson**: You'll just tag it onto our existing cdr, right?
**Bclymer**: Y.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Do you need that number, Alex?
**Brhoades**: Jeff already gave it to us.
**Jdawson**: Okay, perfect.
**Jdawson**: All right, just let me know when that's submitted so I can mark it down.
**Jdawson**: But that's.
**Jdawson**: It's not.
**Jdawson**: That's the last one we're waiting on getting submitted.
**Jdawson**: Is that right, Jeff?
**Ashton**: Correct.
**Ashton**: And then, Joe, what I'll do is I'll email you and fire suppression.
**Ashton**: Yeah, Joe, I'll email you a CDR application that has the rest of it filled out so you can finalize and sign the rest of it.
**Ashton**: And then I'll forward that on to Nick.
**Ashton**: You.
**Brhoades**: You can mark it as electrical as submitted.
**Brhoades**: The permit woman poked her head in during this meeting, and she just asked if it was new construction, so she's.
**Brhoades**: She's probably done with it now.
**Nbigler**: Anything else?
**Jdawson**: I think that that's the end of the agenda unless anybody else has anything to add.
**Jdawson**: Nope.
**Nbigler**: Nick, let's try to get that.
**Nbigler**: Schedule the asap.
**Nbigler**: Glenn, figure out the loads so that we have the answers for them.
**Nbigler**: For the stairs.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I shot him an email already, actually.
**Jdawson**: Hold up.
**Jdawson**: We won't have those until we were finished detailing.
**Jdawson**: And have our engineer do the calcs for this project normally six to eight weeks from now.
**Nbigler**: Well, that dog just ain't gonna hunt.
**Nbigler**: Get him on the phone.
**Nbigler**: We'll figure it out.
**Nbigler**: Thank you.
**Bclymer**: Bye.
