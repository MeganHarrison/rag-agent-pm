**Adam**: Sa.
**Adam**: Hey, Blake, how are we doing?
**Adam**: Good.
**Adam**: How are you?
**Adam**: Good.
**Adam**: Is Brennan well?
**Adam**: Blake, we got demo going full swing on this one.
**Adam**: Would you like to pop by sometime when it's all emptied out, or.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, that'd be great.
**Ataylor**: That was gonna be.
**Ataylor**: Our next question is when you guys think it will be to the point where 1.
**Ataylor**: When we can start.
**Ataylor**: When you think our portion would start, but also when would be a good time to see it?
**Ataylor**: Because obviously mid demo, it can be hard to get eyes on everything.
**Adam**: Yeah.
**Adam**: So I think by the end of this week, we'll be done with demo.
**Adam**: I'll have flooring demo starting as soon as all the walls and ceilings are gone.
**Adam**: So probably be a good time Monday, Tuesday, next week to swing by while flooring is getting pulled up.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, that's perfect.
**Ataylor**: Does it matter what day?
**Ataylor**: Like, do I need to schedule that?
**Adam**: I mean, I'll be there, so just.
**Adam**: I'll give you a shout out.
**Ataylor**: I have a.
**Ataylor**: I have 11 o' clock on Thursday.
**Ataylor**: Sorry, Thursday on Monday, and then I'm open on the first as well.
**Ataylor**: Either of those days work.
**Adam**: Okay, let me give you shout Friday, give you kind of a update on where we're at with things and go from there.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: And then what about.
**Ataylor**: How familiar are you with Job Planner?
**Adam**: I mean, I've gotten used to it pretty quickly.
**Ataylor**: Because it was not letting me.
**Ataylor**: I'm going to see if it works, but I was not able to see anything inside this job for in Job Planner.
**Adam**: Okay, let me get with AJ on that.
**Adam**: It might be like a permissions thing that he needs to change for you.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, let me see.
**Ataylor**: Like, I just, like, you know, if I click on one of those, like, daily reports just to open.
**Ataylor**: Just says that this doesn't exist.
**Ataylor**: All right, let me see.
**Adam**: Can you see drawings or anything?
**Adam**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: And I've.
**Ataylor**: I've had to, like.
**Ataylor**: I mean, we've used Job Planner for other stuff, so I shouldn't have to, like, create a new username and login for this job, correct?
**Adam**: I would assume not.
**Adam**: I think it's just your email and whatever password you chose.
**Adam**: I'll ask A.J.
**Adam**: about that.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, I'm gonna.
**Ataylor**: Let me see while I have you.
**Ataylor**: Real quick, if I can.
**Ataylor**: Let me back in.
**Adam**: Savannah.
**Adam**: Brian.
**Ataylor**: All right, so.
**Ataylor**: Okay, it's working now, so maybe it was just.
**Ataylor**: Maybe just I had to wait for something.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, I can see the drawings.
**Ataylor**: I.
**Ataylor**: I don't have the contract yet, though.
**Ataylor**: Is that in commitments for me now?
**Ataylor**: There it is.
**Ataylor**: So when I click on this contract, it says subcontract sd, whatever the numbers.
**Adam**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: It shows like, you know, sprinkler contract, but then I don't see anything like, do you need me to go in here and like, put schedule values or anything like that?
**Ataylor**: Or is this just.
**Adam**: No, that'll be us.
**Adam**: I just.
**Adam**: Hey, Siri, call A.J.
**Adam**: taylor.
**Ataylor**: Calling A.J.
**Ataylor**: taylor.
**Ataylor**: Work.
**Ataylor**: And then the grand total on my end showed zero dollars.
**Adam**: Yep.
**Adam**: And he could be having a baby right now.
**Ataylor**: Yes, very true.
**Adam**: Your call has been forwarded to it.
**Ataylor**: I did text him about the contract this morning.
**Ataylor**: I didn't get a response, so that could very well be the case.
**Adam**: Yeah, I was on the phone with him earlier and he was like, I gotta.
**Adam**: I gotta hang up.
**Adam**: Baby could be on the way.
**Ataylor**: All right.
**Ataylor**: Oh, there you go.
**Ataylor**: Well, maybe.
**Ataylor**: Maybe we'll find out later.
**Adam**: That was.
**Adam**: That.
**Adam**: That one earlier was a false alarm.
**Adam**: But he's like, yeah, it's any second now.
**Ataylor**: Okay, well, no worries.
**Ataylor**: I mean, I see that the contract is in there.
**Ataylor**: I just.
**Ataylor**: It just shows zero.
**Ataylor**: And I don't see like any of our captions.
**Ataylor**: If I need to upload something, I can do that as well.
**Adam**: Okay.
**Adam**: I mean, what.
**Adam**: You need the contract and then you need to get the drawings and then submit and all that stuff.
**Adam**: So.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, I mean, I'm getting your ball rolling.
**Ataylor**: So, I mean, I'm gonna.
**Ataylor**: I mean, obviously I'm proceeding as if we already have physical contracts since it's all set up in there.
**Adam**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: But at some point, my accounting department will ask for it, so I know it's more of just a to do item, I guess I'm going to keep working on getting everything submitted and all that, regardless.
**Ataylor**: And that shouldn't be an issue.
**Ataylor**: I mean, it's just had relocate, so it should be a pretty quick turnaround.
**Adam**: Good deal.
**Adam**: Everybody else I've kind of reached out to separately on here, my electricians, my H Vac guy, my flooring guy stopped by.
**Adam**: My framer was there, my demo crew was there.
**Adam**: So.
**Ataylor**: Okay, so.
**Ataylor**: So what?
**Ataylor**: What after demo?
**Ataylor**: What's.
**Ataylor**: What's timeline?
**Adam**: Here, let me share my screen.
**Adam**: Can you.
**Adam**: In.
**Adam**: In job planner, can you see the schedule?
**Ataylor**: I can go to schedule.
**Ataylor**: Task list is blank.
**Ataylor**: Calendar is blank.
**Ataylor**: Timeline is also blank.
**Adam**: Here's kind of where we're.
**Adam**: Can you see my screen?
**Ataylor**: Okay, perfect.
**Ataylor**: So similar time frame with the Neiman just kind of that 7, 8 range for start.
**Adam**: Yeah, But Neiman is still waiting on permit, so that one's going to push you back.
**Ataylor**: Got it.
**Ataylor**: That's okay.
**Ataylor**: That's Part of it, unfortunately.
**Ataylor**: All right, perfect.
**Ataylor**: So I made it.
**Ataylor**: I.
**Ataylor**: I'll make a note.
**Ataylor**: Seven, eight, start for this.
**Ataylor**: And on this one, permits are good.
**Ataylor**: Like, it's ready to roll.
**Adam**: Yeah, we're.
**Adam**: We're full steam on this one.
**Ataylor**: Perfect.
**Ataylor**: I'm.
**Ataylor**: I'm gonna follow back up when I get off this call with you.
**Ataylor**: I'll follow back up with our designer on this, because this one will be a little bit more cut and dry.
**Ataylor**: Just adding plexus.
**Adam**: Okay.
**Adam**: Oh, here's A.J.
**Adam**: everything good?
**Adam**: Everything's good.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: Sorry, I was talking with JP when you called.
**Adam**: You're good in this meeting with.
**Adam**: I mean, I.
**Adam**: I reached out to everybody else basically before this, but Blake's on here right now.
**Adam**: Need to get a contract over to him or applied.
**Adam**: Yeah, it's in there, ready to go.
**Ataylor**: I just need to send it, so.
**Adam**: Okay.
**Adam**: I'll PDF it and shoot it over.
**Ataylor**: Here for my computer in a little.
**Adam**: Yeah, he gave you thumbs up, so.
**Ataylor**: Perfect.
**Ataylor**: All right.
**Adam**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: All right, well, we have the owner meeting here at two o' clock, so.
**Adam**: I know.
**Adam**: I'm at foundation right now, sitting in the parking lot on this call, about to head back that way.
**Adam**: Okay.
**Adam**: All right, ma' am.
**Adam**: All right, see you.
**Ataylor**: Bye.
**Adam**: All right, there you go.
**Adam**: There's your answer.
**Ataylor**: Perfect.
**Ataylor**: Good to go.
**Ataylor**: I'm going to get this rolling on my end.
**Ataylor**: Any questions on this project for us?
**Adam**: I'm sure there will be.
**Adam**: Off the top of my head right now, though.
**Ataylor**: Go ahead.
**Ataylor**: The only thing that I want to like specifically look at and ask you on Monday or Tuesday is because in the.
**Ataylor**: In the space, not every space is being renovated.
**Ataylor**: Correct.
**Ataylor**: Are they wanting to match the new sprinkler heads to the old?
**Adam**: Yep.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Adam**: I think that's the smart way to go about it.
**Ataylor**: I think that's safe.
**Ataylor**: I mean, some people don't care as long as, like, they're the same color or whatever.
**Ataylor**: But I always like to ask, because when we go to order material, that will decide where I order them from.
**Adam**: Yep.
**Adam**: And how many?
**Adam**: Because how many do you have to have in a headbox, minimum?
**Ataylor**: Well, that will depend on the building and the way the system is set up, because they probably have existing head boxes.
**Ataylor**: And so if we use the same one, we may not even have to add any in the head box because they're the same head, which is usually why we try to go that route that way in a renovation that's already set up that way.
**Ataylor**: Now, if the head box is empty, obviously, we can get additional.
**Adam**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: But it should.
**Ataylor**: Their head box should already be set up and then we won't obviously pull from the headbox.
**Ataylor**: We'll just install new and leave those there.
**Adam**: Yep.
**Adam**: Perfect.
**Adam**: Alrighty.
**Ataylor**: Well, we're good to go on that.
**Ataylor**: I will.
**Ataylor**: I'll get rolling and as soon as I get my drawing back, I'll send it over to you guys for approval and then we'll take it from there.
**Adam**: All right, Good deal.
**Ataylor**: Great.
**Ataylor**: Appreciate it.
**Adam**: All right, thanks, Blake.
**Ataylor**: Later.
**Adam**: Yeah.
