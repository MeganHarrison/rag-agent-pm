## Transcript
**Bclymer**: Nice to meet you, Jesse.
**Chris.query**: You as well.
**Christian.mcdonald**: The awesome thing is he lives right there in Phoenix, so.
**Bclymer**: Oh, now I feel bad.
**Bclymer**: We're talking change your number fast.
**Christian.mcdonald**: Yeah, he can get to the job site pretty quick.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: We.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Perfect.
**Bclymer**: All right, so I think we.
**Bclymer**: It's.
**Bclymer**: We got me, Jared, and then Jordan Harris is part of the project management team.
**Bclymer**: So her and I will now be tag teaming this project just due to the overall size of this thing.
**Bclymer**: So you'll see her jumping in on a lot of these calls moving forward.
**Bclymer**: So it's a quick update.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: There.
**Bclymer**: There's Hermes.
**Christian.mcdonald**: There's Hermes.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: Yeah, there you go.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: I'm here.
**Jennifer.patterson**: How are you?
**Christian.mcdonald**: Hey, Hermes, how we doing?
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: You guys ready to go?
**Christian.mcdonald**: I believe so, yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so I got what I was telling you guys earlier.
**Bclymer**: So we got the design elements from the architects.
**Bclymer**: But here about five minutes ago, we did make some small changes to the break rooms.
**Bclymer**: Basically the two satellite break rooms on the north and south end.
**Bclymer**: We took these.
**Bclymer**: These small break areas and basically jutted them out, or, sorry, this way out.
**Bclymer**: Like, I don't know.
**Bclymer**: What do you think, Hermes?
**Bclymer**: 15ft?
**Bclymer**: Something like that?
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Yeah, I would say so.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So she's making the changes now to the design and should have it back to us.
**Bclymer**: She said she'll have them back this evening.
**Bclymer**: So if that's the case, I'll put them in the Dropbox and send an update out to everybody.
**Bclymer**: But in terms of overall design, the latest files that I've added this afternoon, there are no additional changes that I'm aware of, so we should be locked in.
**Bclymer**: My feedback to the SIVA team is today's the day.
**Bclymer**: Like, if there are going to be any more changes, we need to get them in today.
**Bclymer**: I don't want to continue to send 35 different iterations of this drawing.
**Bclymer**: So we're trying to lock everything down.
**Bclymer**: Jared is working to finalize the electrical locations and drops in his file.
**Bclymer**: And what else do you have, Jared, in your files that you're working towards?
**Jordan.harris**: So I have all the equipment on the floor.
**Jordan.harris**: All that's defined.
**Jordan.harris**: It's really the office.
**Jordan.harris**: That's the last thing that I need to do.
**Jordan.harris**: There are some minor tweaks to the racking and stuff, but it's nothing that has to be integrated into this.
**Jordan.harris**: The.
**Jordan.harris**: The key thing for me right now is, is to get the office area specked out for the power distribution, and then we can do some cleanup work on the rest of it.
**Jordan.harris**: But I do need Lisa to get those drawings back to us.
**Jennifer.patterson**: Okay.
**Jordan.harris**: Before I can finish.
**Jordan.harris**: Finish it.
**Christian.mcdonald**: You've been adding all this up as you go.
**Christian.mcdonald**: Do you know how many amps it's going to require at this point?
**Jordan.harris**: I, I have it in the table, so.
**Jordan.harris**: But it's not, it's.
**Jordan.harris**: It's really the breaker size that's, that's specked out.
**Jordan.harris**: So I don't know if that's the accurate way to go about adding it up.
**Jordan.harris**: Right.
**Jordan.harris**: I guess you can back into it.
**Christian.mcdonald**: But either way, there's only so many breakers that will fit in a panel.
**Christian.mcdonald**: So if they're larger, sometimes you need to get everything out of it.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: But you can add another soup panel.
**Chris.query**: Yeah, I mean you can add a sub panel that takes a breaker away from wherever it's feeding from.
**Bclymer**: So we'll try to get that defined, you know, between today and Monday.
**Bclymer**: Jesse, so you guys have everything you need in that regard.
**Chris.query**: Christian, you know, on your detail, three down there, you've got a bathroom in the middle of your break room.
**Bclymer**: Where are we at?
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Right here.
**Jennifer.patterson**: Bottom right?
**Jordan.harris**: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Jordan.harris**: She.
**Jordan.harris**: She laid that office area over is actually.
**Jordan.harris**: I don't even think it's that, that, that.
**Jordan.harris**: Well, maybe that one is.
**Jordan.harris**: But either way, she didn't take out the old.
**Jordan.harris**: The original or the existing.
**Bclymer**: Oh, well, yeah, she.
**Bclymer**: She got it on this, this last call we were just on.
**Bclymer**: So I'll get it fixed.
**Bclymer**: Brandon, we're actually going to see if y' all can actually install that.
**Bclymer**: A bathroom and a break room at the same time.
**Chris.query**: Yeah, honestly, that way you don't waste any time.
**Chris.query**: Like people can get.
**Chris.query**: Get it all done.
**Bclymer**: Exactly, exactly.
**Bclymer**: That's the private dining room.
**Chris.query**: That's the private dining room.
**Bclymer**: Great dining.
**Bclymer**: I will say the only thing out of the call that we just had is we did add, I think in this main break room we had a 6.6Stack microwaves.
**Bclymer**: We increased that to 24.24Total microwaves in that main break room.
**Bclymer**: Offset in all.
**Bclymer**: All corners.
**Bclymer**: So six in a corner, basically.
**Bclymer**: So that.
**Bclymer**: That was one of the changes to the electrical elements for that area.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: There's going to be another change.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Well finish there that on the entrance on the turn styles.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: I mean, Robert sent a new drawing.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: So now there's no.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: There's going to be empty space.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: There's going to be walls in between the turnstiles, the middle section with the door.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: So some additional work that is.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: No, that wasn't in describe in the scope of work.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: So that will be an additional item there.
**Chris.query**: You're gonna do dry like hard walls between the turnstiles yeah.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: On the, by the doors.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: When you see the middle door, Christian.
**Chris.query**: What'S the, what's the driver behind that?
**Hermes.rodriguez**: That was security.
**Bclymer**: Cost, I believe, Brandon, for the fencing that we would typically use for our buildings, I think it's pretty expensive in comparison.
**Bclymer**: And the ADA door itself.
**Bclymer**: So we would do drywall and a standard steel door instead of an ADA door or not an ADA door.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, an 88 door.
**Chris.query**: That's what you said when you say an ADA door.
**Chris.query**: Like so typically, like I, you can, I would think, like, I don't know, just think about pricing.
**Chris.query**: Right.
**Chris.query**: Because we're gonna, you know, everybody put stuff on paper, but when you talk about a 40 foot deck, we're going to put a wall in there.
**Chris.query**: Then, you know, like, see, we got to have a header or something we got to tie off.
**Chris.query**: It's just something to look at.
**Chris.query**: Like, you know, it's as far as cost goes because the, the farther you got to stretch things like you know, a header or something, it's, you know.
**Christian.mcdonald**: Sticking it up, talking.
**Christian.mcdonald**: Are you only running, are you running the wall all the way up or just to above the styles?
**Christian.mcdonald**: Just past the turnstiles.
**Christian.mcdonald**: Okay.
**Chris.query**: Yeah, yeah.
**Chris.query**: I mean, that's what you guys want.
**Chris.query**: Drywall, it's just.
**Chris.query**: That's fine.
**Chris.query**: We just typically see fencing.
**Chris.query**: That's the only reason I say that.
**Bclymer**: That's typically what we do.
**Bclymer**: But this drawing that Hermes has got up is our typical install solution.
**Bclymer**: I, I don't know what the terminology is for that door, but I know that's one of the driving factors for the cost.
**Bclymer**: You know, as it costs me a.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Really very expensive door.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: That's what he said.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: We want just a metal door, probably with a sleeve flap on the side, so for safety, but.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: Okay.
**Christian.mcdonald**: Just panic hardware on a whole metal door.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Yeah.
**Jennifer.patterson**: Hey, guys.
**Jennifer.patterson**: Sorry for being late.
**Chris.query**: It's okay, Bill.
**Chris.query**: It's only five o' clock on a Friday, but we'll wait.
**Jennifer.patterson**: It's been crazy today.
**Bclymer**: All right, so let me, let me throw this back up on the screen.
**Bclymer**: So, Jesse, that's really the main changes that we've made over the past 24 hours that I'll get back to you.
**Bclymer**: At least from an office layout and design only changes.
**Bclymer**: We did add double doors in this main security entrance instead of one steel door.
**Bclymer**: So we do want to put two doubles coming into the main building.
**Bclymer**: And it's right there by that riser pipe or that riser pipes right in front of it.
**Bclymer**: So we'd have to look to see what we need to do.
**Bclymer**: In that area.
**Christian.mcdonald**: Okay.
**Christian.mcdonald**: Well, we.
**Christian.mcdonald**: I don't know which way we're shifting it.
**Christian.mcdonald**: That's a standpipe for the.
**Chris.query**: Like an ftc.
**Bclymer**: I think if you shift it the other way, the tilt wall seam is right there.
**Chris.query**: Yeah, that's okay.
**Chris.query**: I mean, you can reinforce.
**Chris.query**: We can put a header in that and reinforce it.
**Chris.query**: It's easier to do that than to move the sprinkler.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: We would go off whatever else.
**Bclymer**: Best recommendation being for that one, I think.
**Christian.mcdonald**: And then if we can.
**Christian.mcdonald**: And I know the electrical drawings, if you finish them up, they'll clarify a lot of things.
**Christian.mcdonald**: But just looking through the.
**Christian.mcdonald**: Going through your basically scopes of different work.
**Christian.mcdonald**: Like, are we just going to go off the drawings?
**Christian.mcdonald**: I just want to know how much of that we're going to stick to on the pricing.
**Christian.mcdonald**: And then.
**Chris.query**: Yeah.
**Chris.query**: Jared, do you.
**Bclymer**: Do you mind pulling up your file since you have it in CAD and we can move around on it pretty quick?
**Jordan.harris**: Sure.
**Bclymer**: And then from a, from a pricing perspective, Bill, since.
**Bclymer**: Since you're on the call, I know I haven't been a part of all the discussions from a prioritization aspect, but what has been your feedback to the group on how you want to divvy.
**Chris.query**: This up.
**Bclymer**: Overall bid package for everything and then prioritize the key items out of it?
**Jennifer.patterson**: Who are you directing that to?
**Chris.query**: You?
**Jennifer.patterson**: Yeah, it needs.
**Jennifer.patterson**: It needs to go to.
**Jennifer.patterson**: To, to Hermes here.
**Jennifer.patterson**: But.
**Jennifer.patterson**: Yeah, but I can help.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: So you ask the question again.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: I did cut off a little bit on my.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: On my ends.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So how do you guys want to prioritize these key items that Jesse, Brandon and the team need to go out and quote?
**Bclymer**: Because these guys will need to know what we're kind of chasing after here.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: From the office standpoint or, or electrical or anything else.
**Chris.query**: I guess.
**Bclymer**: Bill, what's.
**Bclymer**: What's been discussed in.
**Bclymer**: In the discussions with Alito?
**Bclymer**: Is it the whole package?
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Yeah.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: I mean, the only thing I would break down will be the LED lighting.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Bill, correct me if I'm wrong.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: I mean, what I want to do it is, you know, give me all the infrastructure as one normal quote.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Right.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: And then the lighting, the LED lighting, like a different.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Like a second scope of work, like a.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Like a different project because.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Because lighting probably gonna.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Gonna be ahead of the.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: The construction work because rocking and schedule on permitting.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: So I think lighting would be completely separate than just the.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: The construction scope of work.
**Jennifer.patterson**: So.
**Jennifer.patterson**: Hey, Brandon, what are you and Jesse's thoughts on this?
**Jennifer.patterson**: We think when we look at the critical path here, the lighting element, because of the timing of the other construction is most important.
**Jennifer.patterson**: So that's why I think Hermes is suggesting we try to deliver a much more advanced proposal for lighting that peels that out of this with the balance being, you know, being the, the balance of the, of the building or the balance of the scope.
**Jennifer.patterson**: What, what are your, what are your guys thoughts on that?
**Chris.query**: Yeah, I mean Bill, like we talked about to obviously with.
**Chris.query**: When you're doing your racking.
**Chris.query**: Yes.
**Chris.query**: I mean you've got to get that lighting ordered.
**Chris.query**: I mean immediately to try to hit that date.
**Chris.query**: And then the other thing that, to look at the other long lead items out outside of.
**Chris.query**: If we have to add any electrical gear, which we're hoping we don't, it's going to be your dock equipment.
**Jennifer.patterson**: Yeah.
**Jennifer.patterson**: And I think we still need to sort that out.
**Jennifer.patterson**: We don't want to piecemeal this together, but let me ask this question and Hermes, please jump in.
**Jennifer.patterson**: But what happens if we try?
**Jennifer.patterson**: I mean like, how fast could you guys give us a.
**Jennifer.patterson**: A firm bid on lighting relative to, you know, full installation?
**Jennifer.patterson**: You know, full installation, lighting panels, breakers, everything that would be associated to bring that.
**Jennifer.patterson**: Bring that live as a package.
**Jennifer.patterson**: And again, we want to separate all this out.
**Jennifer.patterson**: But is that something that you.
**Jennifer.patterson**: That you could say, hey, we could give you something by Tuesday of next week on that particular element.
**Chris.query**: Yeah, we could, we could do a takeoff and get you, you know, some numbers by, you know, early next week.
**Chris.query**: You know, to, to be able to get the lighting going.
**Chris.query**: I think I.
**Chris.query**: I'm sure there's some Deltas in here still that we have just because some of the stuff the vendors we just won't have the, they just won't give us the pricing that quick.
**Chris.query**: And so.
**Chris.query**: But Jesse and I know enough.
**Chris.query**: We do this enough to where we'll.
**Chris.query**: Our team will, you know, put together an estimate based off of what the quantities are and everything and get you guys similar like when I sent you, you know, whatever this week, you know, for what that's going to, you know, be.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: We'll just.
**Chris.query**: If you guys have a lighting plan, we'll tighten it up because I mean I just, I just did a takeoff myself.
**Chris.query**: Yeah.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Beyond so interrupted you Brandon.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: And this.
**Chris.query**: It was.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Something was brought up to me today.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: The emergency lights, I think is the.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: I think there's a new code.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: They have to be dedicated circuit and I think they're not.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Can you please validate that as part of the design?
**Chris.query**: The, the emergency lights have to be a dedicated circuit.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Yes.
**Chris.query**: Yeah, you'll have emergency lighting in, in the, in each aisle.
**Chris.query**: You'll have to have.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: I think they're not on the dedicated circuit right now.
**Chris.query**: They're, they're, they're not on identicating circuit.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: That's what I was told.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Can you check and validate that information?
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Because that would change cost.
**Chris.query**: Yeah, we'll, we'll look at it and I don't, I mean, I'll look.
**Chris.query**: Maybe that's a local thing or something.
**Chris.query**: I mean, I, I mean, you have to run essentially two circuits down an.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Aisle that, you know, how old is the building?
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Like 10 years old, 7 years old?
**Jarrod.kimmey**: Yeah.
**Chris.query**: So typically what, those, those emerge like emergency lights are just battery backup.
**Chris.query**: Like you don't have a separate circuit.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: I mean, I'm not talking about.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: I think the emergency light.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: The, the light.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: LED lighting on the building.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: The emergency lights, unless they have a.
**Christian.mcdonald**: Generator, which they don't, there's not going to be another circuit.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Yeah, because I was told the emergency light, I mean, I'm not talking about emergency line, the rocking emergency, the LED emergency lights.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: So I think I was told that they have to be in a dedicated circuit and they're not.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: But I think that is a new code, so we may change it.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: We have to bring the building up to code, right?
**Chris.query**: Yeah, you would have to bring the building up to code, but again, we'll look into it.
**Chris.query**: That would be a very new and odd thing to require is dedicated circuitry for us because it's not emergency.
**Chris.query**: I mean, emergency lights just means they have a battery backup and so to say, oh, we have a dedicated circuit for the emergency lights like that, but we don't have a generator.
**Chris.query**: That doesn't make sense.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: That's what I mean.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: It's understood and communicated in the wrong way.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: But just validate all, you know, that information, I guess.
**Chris.query**: Yeah, we will.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Yeah, we get more details.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: I will get additional details about it and then I'll let you know.
**Jennifer.patterson**: Okay, so, so yeah, I think it would be good to check that, but I, I mean, Brandon, I fully agree with you.
**Jennifer.patterson**: I mean, I think that would typically be the case what you described and, and then if so, Hermes, let's talk about this.
**Jennifer.patterson**: If we want to, to get Brandon and them to give us the full lighting package, which would be, you know, the VNA aisles, you know, the rest of the, the docs and, you know, exit signs, could that all be folded into this scope that, that we're talking about?
**Jennifer.patterson**: Brandon, do you see any problem with that or do you need more detail from us to provide that?
**Jennifer.patterson**: And I Think part of that also is are we in a position to reuse some of the existing lighting in the building for perhaps the docks or something like that?
**Chris.query**: Well, I don't think there is much existing lighting that you can reuse because there is a dark warehouse.
**Chris.query**: So from my understanding, Jesse, there's not a lot of lights we could reuse, is there?
**Jennifer.patterson**: And I didn't get the opportunity to go there.
**Jennifer.patterson**: So I'm really talking without the appropriate background.
**Jennifer.patterson**: So if that's the case, that's fine.
**Jennifer.patterson**: It's just a question.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Yeah, I mean, you're not able to use like a 16 conduits or like material.
**Christian.mcdonald**: Well, if they happen to fall in the right spot.
**Christian.mcdonald**: But you know, this rack layout, we'd have to overlay it with where the lights are.
**Chris.query**: Now what we're, what we're talking about, guys, is pennywise and pound foolish.
**Chris.query**: Like the amount of cost savings that you would have by us trying to go and reuse the 30 lights or whatever it is is not worth your time.
**Chris.query**: You guys need speed right now.
**Jennifer.patterson**: Yeah, so, so, so, hey, Brandon, you guys are coming from a better position of information and intelligence there.
**Jennifer.patterson**: So let's, let's negate, let's negate that question.
**Jennifer.patterson**: I, I did not know we were that bare in the building.
**Jennifer.patterson**: So let's just forget that then.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: Okay.
**Chris.query**: But so yeah, to answer your.
**Jennifer.patterson**: Question as far as comment.
**Chris.query**: Yeah, yeah, so answer your question as far as that.
**Chris.query**: So, yes, so we can price up the lighting and the exit signs and everything.
**Chris.query**: I like.
**Chris.query**: And just based off of numbers because we don't have a photometric or anything yet.
**Chris.query**: And I don't know necessarily if I could turn one around by Tuesday.
**Chris.query**: What I can do is, you know, essentially just lay it out based off of 30 foot candles at, you know, 3 foot average or whatever, like, which is what's typical.
**Chris.query**: And we're just going to space it accordingly and you know, you're.
**Chris.query**: Again, it's.
**Chris.query**: If we have, let's call it whatever, a thousand lights, you know, whether that's, you know, seven in one aisle or 10 in one hour or whatever, like the light count and the length of wire, all that stuff can, can adjust like, but it's the total that we're really looking for.
**Bclymer**: Got it.
**Jennifer.patterson**: Okay, makes sense.
**Chris.query**: What's the question?
**Chris.query**: What is the blue racking?
**Chris.query**: Because I didn't know whenever I was doing the original lighting layout.
**Chris.query**: Is that VNA or is that, is that Totes and boxes?
**Chris.query**: What is that?
**Jennifer.patterson**: It's, it's, it's racking.
**Jennifer.patterson**: That is Going to support carton.
**Jennifer.patterson**: It's, it's carton pick versus palette.
**Jennifer.patterson**: So think of it the same way.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: Gotcha.
**Chris.query**: That's all right.
**Chris.query**: I still need to do, do stuff in those aisles.
**Chris.query**: Okay.
**Jennifer.patterson**: Yes.
**Chris.query**: Perfect then.
**Chris.query**: Yeah, yeah, we can give a number.
**Chris.query**: And then the biggest thing on the speed bays bill is do you guys have any idea like is it task lighting or do you just need the average 30 foot candles?
**Jennifer.patterson**: Hey Chris, any.
**Jennifer.patterson**: Chris, I saw you join.
**Jennifer.patterson**: Any comment on that?
**Jennifer.patterson**: I mean typically, I don't want to start changing criteria, but typically on our, on our docks or inbound and outbound, are we just typically doing 30 foot candles?
**Jennifer.patterson**: Are we bumping that up?
**Steven.howen**: I think we should bump that up to 44 candles.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: That's what I read.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: 40.
**Jennifer.patterson**: Okay, then let's go with that criteria.
**Jennifer.patterson**: Let's go with 40.
**Jennifer.patterson**: And then we would use task lighting for inside as an example for inside the truck itself.
**Jennifer.patterson**: But, but that's a separate.
**Chris.query**: So yeah, that's a dock light.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: But that is.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Let me, Jesse, that you were there.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: I mean the amount of lighting on the docks I think is good enough right now.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: You got the two, two, two rows on high bay on the, on the north side and this.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Well, I didn't remember the north side of the building.
**Bclymer**: It'll be pretty dark when you feel that building up with rack even on the front docks.
**Steven.howen**: Yeah, that's why I think we really need the photometrics.
**Steven.howen**: But that area as well.
**Steven.howen**: And we can use, we can use some of the existing lighting, you know, we can add on to the docks, you know, what we remove out in the racking area.
**Jennifer.patterson**: So we were talking about that Chris, A minute ago I brought that comment up and you know, Jesse and them were saying that the amount of lighting in the building right now is so then that it's almost not worth trying to repurpose that the material.
**Steven.howen**: I mean, so the lighting we take down, the existing lighting that we take down, you know, where the racking's at, we can move some of that to the, to the dock.
**Chris.query**: I wasn't, I wasn't exactly clear like, like taking those existing lights down.
**Chris.query**: We'll do that while we're up there.
**Chris.query**: But what we were talking about is like trying to, to, to reuse them in the racking and stuff.
**Chris.query**: That's not necessarily worth it.
**Chris.query**: But we can get in there and take them down and then when we do another area like the bays or whatever, then we'll throw those up.
**Chris.query**: But we wouldn't reuse them in the racking area.
**Jennifer.patterson**: Yeah.
**Jennifer.patterson**: I think we fail.
**Jennifer.patterson**: I think I, Well, I think we, we just had some miscommunication there.
**Jennifer.patterson**: So.
**Jennifer.patterson**: Yes, I wasn't implying to reuse them within the racking area or within where they sit today.
**Jennifer.patterson**: I was really saying, hey, do we just go ahead and take those down and use those to add lighting along the dock?
**Jennifer.patterson**: That was what I was really driving at.
**Jennifer.patterson**: Yeah.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: And.
**Chris.query**: Yes, absolutely.
**Jennifer.patterson**: Okay, perfect.
**Chris.query**: So 30 foot, 30 foot candles in the racking.
**Chris.query**: 40 foot candles at the speed base.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: Correct.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: Okay.
**Jennifer.patterson**: And.
**Jennifer.patterson**: And when you think about the speed base, you know, it's.
**Jennifer.patterson**: Yeah, no, I, I guess I was just saying on the speed base, you know, I, I think to the west and the east, for example, on the north side, you know, whatever we need to put there in that, in that space between the, in the speed bay between the wall and the racking.
**Jennifer.patterson**: It's pretty thin there.
**Jennifer.patterson**: It's, it's not like we were going to be doing a lot of activity.
**Jennifer.patterson**: The predominance is really, you know, in the area where we have all the dock area associated with the sorters.
**Jennifer.patterson**: And in between that.
**Jennifer.patterson**: Yeah, yeah.
**Chris.query**: The good, the good thing is, Bill, like, you know, we're going to start doing the racking lighting first and the speed based stuff will be later.
**Chris.query**: So we can, you know, we'll again, we'll give a, you know, a total ballpark number, but by the time we get the actual photometric study and it's like, all right, hey, we got to add whatever, 10 more lights per bay then, you know, we shouldn't have even started that work yet.
**Jennifer.patterson**: Great, perfect.
**Jennifer.patterson**: Now that makes sense.
**Jennifer.patterson**: Brandon.
**Chris.query**: Yeah.
**Chris.query**: The biggest thing is what you guys need from my understanding, and I would agree with, is that we got to say, hey guys, you are, you know, whatever, it's a million dollars for this lights, you know, and we're within 10%.
**Chris.query**: And then that way you get the bulk order going and you know, it's in three weeks from now.
**Chris.query**: It's like how we actually need to be at 50 foot candles or whatever.
**Chris.query**: It's not a big deal.
**Chris.query**: We can order it because you've got at least the main stuff coming to stay on schedule.
**Jennifer.patterson**: Yeah.
**Jennifer.patterson**: And also, and I know maybe we could have done, maybe put more detail and I don't know how Hermes called this out, but I would also put 40 foot candles perhaps where we have the sorter.
**Jennifer.patterson**: So where it comes, where it comes.
**Chris.query**: From 23 and 36 or 38.
**Jennifer.patterson**: Yeah.
**Jennifer.patterson**: So.
**Jennifer.patterson**: So can you, can you show that?
**Jennifer.patterson**: No, no, no.
**Jennifer.patterson**: So, so we're saying the speed Bay.
**Jennifer.patterson**: Yes.
**Jennifer.patterson**: But then where we make the turn and go 90 down that area.
**Jennifer.patterson**: Yeah.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: Yep.
**Chris.query**: I'm with you, Chris.
**Jennifer.patterson**: Do you agree with that or.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: Yes.
**Steven.howen**: Yeah, I think we need 40 there as well.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Yeah, but remember, also, you're going to add probably be as fans around there.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: All right.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: I mean, even with trying to get the solution for the H vac, but I'm assuming that we probably would be ending having HVLs fencing in around that area.
**Jennifer.patterson**: Yeah, we'll just set up to do the overlay for the HVLS with regard to that and the lighting.
**Chris.query**: Yeah, again, that'll, like, we don't have to know that right now.
**Chris.query**: Like, we just know we have it and we'll adjust locations as needed.
**Jennifer.patterson**: Yep.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: All right.
**Chris.query**: Okay, so to recap here, so Jesse and I and the team will throw together real quick numbers for the lighting so that we can get that done.
**Chris.query**: You know, the.
**Chris.query**: The lighting package, exit signs, all that stuff.
**Chris.query**: So that stuff gets rolling, you know, to.
**Chris.query**: To be lined up with your racking.
**Chris.query**: What about the rest of it?
**Chris.query**: When do we have to.
**Chris.query**: Like, what.
**Chris.query**: Like, I know I saw RFP said July 2nd.
**Chris.query**: We know that that is probably a little late.
**Chris.query**: Like, when.
**Chris.query**: Like, what do we want to do to get the entire thing put together to get moving, you know, so that we're in for permits, long lead items, like, the whole project gets progressing.
**Jennifer.patterson**: So.
**Jennifer.patterson**: So, Brandon, let me ask you this.
**Jennifer.patterson**: What do you think if we didn't set a time and you could work this as fast as you could, what would that.
**Jennifer.patterson**: What do you think is possible there?
**Chris.query**: I'm gonna say, if you didn't give me a time and you just said, brandon, we need a number.
**Chris.query**: We need to get this thing built, I would be confident by the end of next week.
**Chris.query**: Now, Jesse and the other teammates can tell me that that's not feasible oil, but I think that we can do that.
**Chris.query**: Jesse, would you agree?
**Christian.mcdonald**: Yeah, I think we can.
**Chris.query**: Yeah.
**Chris.query**: I mean, we'll do, you know, again, all the takeoffs and everything, and we've already.
**Chris.query**: Again, we started preemptively getting numbers this week.
**Chris.query**: So, you know, I'm confident in us, you know, throwing it together, especially knowing that, I mean, you guys, you got to get moving on this thing because you're out of time.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: The concern here is the lighting.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Yeah.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: The GC can take a little bit longer, and it's.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: I mean, of course, if we count everything by the end of next week, that would be great, but I think the challenge here would be lighting.
**Jennifer.patterson**: Yeah.
**Chris.query**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I mean, so.
**Jennifer.patterson**: So Hermes let's go with this.
**Jennifer.patterson**: Let's go with this criteria.
**Jennifer.patterson**: Let's.
**Jennifer.patterson**: Let's let them provide us a proposal for lighting by end of day Tuesday.
**Jennifer.patterson**: And then if they can give us a balance or they can put that as a line item that they've already quoted into their proposal for the, you know, for the entire requirement that you have outlined by end of week, I think that that is very reasonable, don't you?
**Hermes.rodriguez**: No, no, I agree.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: That would be great.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: Yeah.
**Jennifer.patterson**: So, Brandon, I would say let's work that criteria and then I think, you know, we ceba, if we, as you get into this when, you know, you have, you know, RFIs or questions or something that you need for us to help respond to, to bring clarity to.
**Jennifer.patterson**: We will make the time next week to support that.
**Chris.query**: Yeah, I mean, yeah, we're gonna.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: I will be on site on Tuesday morning, so if you need me to take any additional pictures or any additional information, since I will be in the building, just let me know.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: Yep.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: Yeah.
**Chris.query**: Well, I said, bill, we'll get everything put together and everything and we'll, you know, make some assumptions as needed and clarify it.
**Chris.query**: But, you know, the biggest thing is we're going to get you, you know, to 90% of what you need, and that way, you know, you guys can get moving.
**Christian.mcdonald**: And do you have.
**Christian.mcdonald**: Will we get those electrical drawings that you got, like today or Monday?
**Jordan.harris**: Yeah, I mean, I can share the.
**Jordan.harris**: All the equipment on the floor that.
**Jordan.harris**: That is finished.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: I don't think what we're adding would be a lot of impact for them, but go ahead.
**Jordan.harris**: Yeah, I'm just, I, like I said, I'm.
**Jordan.harris**: I'm waiting for the changes for the office area.
**Jordan.harris**: I'm going to start.
**Jordan.harris**: I still have work to do on that, but I can, I could take what I have on paper now and send you that and then whatever minor changes we have associated.
**Jordan.harris**: When she gets her revisions done, I mean, we can give an update on Monday, but I, I don't think it'll be major.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Yeah.
**Jordan.harris**: In terms.
**Jordan.harris**: Most of its outlets and, you know, things for the, for the break areas in the offices.
**Jordan.harris**: Right.
**Jordan.harris**: And that.
**Jordan.harris**: That's it.
**Chris.query**: Yeah, I'd say, I'd say, you know, you know, if, if, if you got your electrical friends already done and they're coming out Monday.
**Jennifer.patterson**: Great.
**Chris.query**: Soon then.
**Chris.query**: But I'd say we press like, freeze in time, you know, with whatever you got, because anything else that you.
**Chris.query**: Oh, the door needs to move to the left.
**Chris.query**: Like, none of that stuff is going to be big enough to make a difference.
**Chris.query**: Like that's all minor things we can take care of after the fact.
**Chris.query**: The biggest thing is the overall scope, getting the, you know, the budget number and getting moving.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Yeah.
**Jennifer.patterson**: I would say then if.
**Jennifer.patterson**: Hey, Jared, based on that, do you want to send a copy over and, and Hermes?
**Jennifer.patterson**: Are you good with that?
**Jordan.harris**: Yeah, I mean, that's fine.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: When the changes list are gonna make, it's not gonna be big different.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: If Gerald can send that now.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Hey.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Yeah, I'm okay.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Yeah, I mean, okay, just going to be this just at the end, it's going to match up.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: It's going to be the same.
**Jennifer.patterson**: So.
**Jennifer.patterson**: So let's do this.
**Jennifer.patterson**: Jared, Contract the changes that, that occur after this, we go ahead and let Jared send this over.
**Jennifer.patterson**: That way we can expedite the, you know, the process.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Yeah, I mean, we're adding some kind of microwave, expanding the office a little bit more electrical.
**Jordan.harris**: Yeah, I mean, the only thing with the office is, is I don't have, I don't have them documented yet in the break areas.
**Jordan.harris**: That's the only thing that I, I need to do.
**Chris.query**: Bill, we'll just add it.
**Chris.query**: We'll add a line item for construction contingency for things like this.
**Jordan.harris**: All right.
**Jennifer.patterson**: Yeah, that'll be that, that'll be fine.
**Jennifer.patterson**: Just add a contingency or an allowance or something.
**Chris.query**: Yeah, yeah, easy enough.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: Okay.
**Jennifer.patterson**: Okay.
**Jordan.harris**: All right, I'll.
**Jordan.harris**: You know the same Dropbox that I used last week?
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Yes.
**Jordan.harris**: All right, good deal.
**Christian.mcdonald**: And then do you have the, the fencing for the.
**Christian.mcdonald**: In the parking lot?
**Christian.mcdonald**: Is that close?
**Hermes.rodriguez**: On the parking lot?
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Can you, can you go over that what you have?
**Jordan.harris**: I mean, I have the original.
**Chris.query**: But.
**Jordan.harris**: You know, there's, there's.
**Jordan.harris**: Well, you've been there, right?
**Jordan.harris**: So I don't, I don't have what security wants modified, documented on this.
**Jordan.harris**: So we can send whatever Robert provided.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Ah, we got a call this morning and they want to do it at least there's no here.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: They're gonna have it in the middle, but it's.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: No, it's.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Well, it's gonna be same power.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Doesn't matter.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: It's.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: I don't think it's gonna be in the same spot that what he was discussed early this week.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: I think it's gonna be in a different spot, but it's still the same.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Same.
**Jordan.harris**: So is Lisa documenting that?
**Hermes.rodriguez**: I'm sorry?
**Jordan.harris**: Is Lisa documenting that?
**Hermes.rodriguez**: No, that was coming from Robert on that.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So let me step in real quick.
**Bclymer**: So, Jesse, we'll.
**Bclymer**: We'll have the exterior fencing drawings and the guard shack by Monday of Next week, Lisa is coming.
**Bclymer**: Capturing the architect is capturing the guard shack.
**Bclymer**: We're just working with our security team to spec out their requirements for that area and all the fencing around the building.
**Bclymer**: So we'll have it on Monday.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Okay, so more changes to come.
**Chris.query**: So.
**Chris.query**: So Nelson is doing.
**Chris.query**: It looks like full permanent architectural drawings or are they just doing conceptuals?
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Just.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Just get ready, dude.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: I mean, I'm beating.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Also in the.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: In the beat package will be.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: You would do an MEPs.
**Chris.query**: Okay, so we're so in my number, we're going to include full design as well, correct?
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Yeah, full engineering.
**Chris.query**: Okay, great.
**Christian.mcdonald**: And there was talk about like the total of new doc levelers, dock locks, seals and all that is.
**Christian.mcdonald**: Is it 56?
**Hermes.rodriguez**: I got it off to 60.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: 60.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: I think I put in the big package.
**Christian.mcdonald**: Okay, so just go with 60.
**Jennifer.patterson**: Is it 60 or 61?
**Jennifer.patterson**: What.
**Jennifer.patterson**: What was the final.
**Jennifer.patterson**: Is that what you have in there, Hermes?
**Jennifer.patterson**: 60.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: I had a 60 because we were not finalizing.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: But if you're gonna be an additional one, then you were like another 20.
**Jordan.harris**: It's 61 in total.
**Jordan.harris**: There's five levelers that we can repurpose and reuse given where they're currently at.
**Jordan.harris**: So, you know, right now the number is 61.
**Jordan.harris**: 56 have to be installed, but.
**Jordan.harris**: And then we would have to move some fans and this and that and then install new as well.
**Jordan.harris**: But I think that Hermes, I sent you that.
**Jordan.harris**: That breakdown, correct?
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Yeah.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Well, you put in the chat.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Yeah, I took a.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: You know, I.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Save it.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: Okay.
**Christian.mcdonald**: And when you repurpose the ones we're infilling those spots.
**Jordan.harris**: No, no, no.
**Jordan.harris**: They're in the right location.
**Jordan.harris**: They're right on.
**Jordan.harris**: They're on the right doors.
**Jordan.harris**: That's how we don't have to do any.
**Jordan.harris**: Any change.
**Christian.mcdonald**: Just add in the locks and seals and all that.
**Jordan.harris**: Yep.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Yeah.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Because there's nothing outside.
**Christian.mcdonald**: And does that.
**Christian.mcdonald**: Do you have a drawing now that pinpoints all these locations.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Darrell?
**Jordan.harris**: Yeah, they.
**Jordan.harris**: It's on this.
**Jordan.harris**: It's documented here.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: Okay.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: So Darrell, can you.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: I know you.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Are you putting that on the.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: In the.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: In the folder?
**Jordan.harris**: Yeah.
**Jordan.harris**: Well, so I.
**Jordan.harris**: I'm going to put it.
**Jordan.harris**: I think the way I sent it to these guys originally is I created a Dropbox account and that's what I.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Used to send it because I Dropboxing teams or.
**Jordan.harris**: No, no, no, no, no.
**Jordan.harris**: This is just a Dropbox because I couldn't get the.
**Jordan.harris**: The SharePoint to.
**Jordan.harris**: I couldn't send the invite to him.
**Jordan.harris**: It wouldn't allow it said I did not have permissions.
**Jordan.harris**: So that's how I sent the file to him.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: And you send me a link to that.
**Jordan.harris**: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Jordan.harris**: I.
**Jordan.harris**: I can invite you.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Please.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: Yeah.
**Christian.mcdonald**: And did you find out any more info on any landlord requirements or owner requirements for that equipment?
**Hermes.rodriguez**: What do you mean?
**Hermes.rodriguez**: For the dock equipment?
**Christian.mcdonald**: As far as the brand or style.
**Christian.mcdonald**: Yes.
**Jennifer.patterson**: Is the.
**Jennifer.patterson**: The landlord or property owner dictating something on that?
**Jennifer.patterson**: Hermes.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: No.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: I mean, because we were also looking on costs from other vendors and all Jesse's.
**Chris.query**: All Jesse's looking for is that for instance, if you've got blue Giant there.
**Chris.query**: Now do we have to stick with that or can we just use, you know, whatever is readily available and most cost effective?
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Whatever is available.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: I mean, the requirements.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: Okay.
**Jennifer.patterson**: I don't think there's enough there that we have to follow the protocol.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: They're just running out of, I don't know, probably over 200 doors.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: 400 doors.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: Okay, perfect.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Whatever works.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: I guess I meet the requirements.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: So we were looking for the duct levelers, duct seal bumpers, restraints for the trailer, communication lights, the yellow fence combo with the light.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: Yep.
**Chris.query**: Dock fan, dock lights.
**Chris.query**: Yep.
**Chris.query**: All that.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: Yep.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Yeah.
**Steven.howen**: But do you want to match the current dock fans with the existing.
**Steven.howen**: Since we've already used those.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: I would like to match for the one that we have that.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: The system right there.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Yes.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: Okay.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Just give us the most cost efficient that you make.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: It works.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: I guess.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: I mean, it's not numbers.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: I don't have that.
**Christian.mcdonald**: I took some pictures of them.
**Christian.mcdonald**: So I'll just send them to our people or scoping it.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Become blue or white or whatever color it is.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: I mean they just do the work.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: That's what we really care you.
**Chris.query**: Yeah, we're.
**Chris.query**: We'll get you a number.
**Chris.query**: Again, some of these finishing details aren't going to drive cost right now.
**Chris.query**: Like what?
**Chris.query**: You know, in three weeks from now, if it's like, hey, they got to be.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: If.
**Chris.query**: Yeah, you know.
**Chris.query**: Yeah, just yellow.
**Chris.query**: Doc.
**Chris.query**: Doc light.
**Chris.query**: It's not a big deal.
**Chris.query**: In three weeks from now, we got to change it then to a different blue.
**Chris.query**: Whatever.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: We'll.
**Chris.query**: We'll figure that out.
**Chris.query**: The biggest thing is you need a total number.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: That's right.
**Bclymer**: Brandon, when.
**Bclymer**: When we look at the timing of this, this project specific to the lighting.
**Bclymer**: What's your feel or gut on just overall install timeline?
**Bclymer**: Like say business award, happened next Friday or something like that.
**Bclymer**: How long would it take until lighting starts going in?
**Chris.query**: I mean, when.
**Chris.query**: When do you guys start racking again?
**Chris.query**: Is it in July?
**Jennifer.patterson**: 7-14-14.
**Jennifer.patterson**: Yeah, somewhere.
**Jennifer.patterson**: So I few days to that.
**Chris.query**: Yeah, I would try to start with it as soon as I can.
**Chris.query**: The biggest thing is getting it.
**Chris.query**: So I'd have to see like if we can expedite, you know, a hundred of them or something like that.
**Chris.query**: That's the, that's the biggest challenge.
**Chris.query**: So we would, we would plan on mobilizing and getting guys there, you know, right around whenever you're starting that racking.
**Chris.query**: Assuming that we get released in time.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: Okay.
**Jennifer.patterson**: So Brandon, I would think that, you know, you guys start formulating, you know, whatever questions you guys have again, we'll be glad to reconvene.
**Jennifer.patterson**: Specifically, let's, you know, we'll focus on the lighting first.
**Jennifer.patterson**: Any questions you have specific to that?
**Jennifer.patterson**: Yeah, yeah.
**Chris.query**: I mean, we'll, we'll get that put together and we'll obviously.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: You know, the.
**Chris.query**: Design and permitting is going to be something that we'll, we'll have to see, you know, how fast we can get it.
**Chris.query**: And I mean, we'll find a way to start getting lights, you know, roughed in and hung.
**Chris.query**: I mean we've got some flexibility with it being inside an existing warehouse.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: Right.
**Christian.mcdonald**: And then can you, I'm stalking the Jen, about the two different little forklift, the two manufacturers you're looking at to give us.
**Christian.mcdonald**: Can we get some cut sheets from both of them and then, you know, because there's like 5amp difference in the draw on those to try and figure out the price difference between those two.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: That's an open item right now.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Christian.
**Bclymer**: Right, we got them.
**Bclymer**: I'll send them to you.
**Bclymer**: Jesse.
**Bclymer**: The only thing, the only call out that I would make and Bill jump in if I'm wrong.
**Bclymer**: But we're still trying to work on if how we're going to split that out from a quantity perspective and if that's really the route we're going to go at this point, we're waiting on some additional feedback, but I can get you to cut sheets at least.
**Bclymer**: Jesse.
**Chris.query**: So if you don't know if there's a draw difference and you don't know the number, what I would suggest is we assume the worst and carry in price based off of using the one that draws more.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: We thought with the 35amps or 32.
**Chris.query**: Yeah.
**Chris.query**: So you need a 35amp breaker.
**Jennifer.patterson**: So 35amp breaker would be the, the high side.
**Jennifer.patterson**: But again, I'm, I'm a little bit concerned.
**Jennifer.patterson**: Why don't we do this?
**Jennifer.patterson**: You know, we'll send you those.
**Jennifer.patterson**: Let's wait and send the cut sheets on Monday.
**Jennifer.patterson**: Christian, I, we Need to have I think a little bit more conversation.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: Because.
**Christian.mcdonald**: There was also talk about, you know, use one.
**Christian.mcdonald**: Then we got to do epoxy flooring and exhaust fans because they got temp, you know.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: I would just go with the 35 the worst case scenario because then you end up getting the lithium batteries.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Then it's gonna be 35 even.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: It's gonna be sooner or later.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, we can review it offline.
**Bclymer**: Bill, I don't mind waiting till Monday.
**Bclymer**: That's fine.
**Chris.query**: Perfect.
**Chris.query**: Jesse, any other questions?
**Christian.mcdonald**: No, I think that's it.
**Christian.mcdonald**: The H vac.
**Christian.mcdonald**: As far as like we would be adding some for the employee area in the front.
**Christian.mcdonald**: And then is each of these or some of these bathrooms.
**Christian.mcdonald**: They're.
**Christian.mcdonald**: They're not getting conditioned and it would just be the break rooms.
**Christian.mcdonald**: The added.
**Chris.query**: Basically.
**Chris.query**: Yeah, I'd say probably everything that's got a demising wall essential.
**Chris.query**: Bill, anything from your SIBA team?
**Chris.query**: Anything else you guys need for us or.
**Jennifer.patterson**: I mean, Hermes.
**Jennifer.patterson**: Are you Hermes?
**Jennifer.patterson**: Are you good?
**Hermes.rodriguez**: I'm good.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: I mean like I say, you need any, any additional information, pictures or anything?
**Hermes.rodriguez**: I'll be on site on Tuesday morning.
**Christian.mcdonald**: I think to target with John, like getting your new IT closet built is something he said needs to happen right away.
**Christian.mcdonald**: Should we put that in with the electrical?
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Yes.
**Christian.mcdonald**: With the lights?
**Christian.mcdonald**: Yes, immediately.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Well, that would be part of the GC but no, leave it something the normal GC work.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: Okay.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: I mean that was just a 12 by 12 to 12 by 10 room with like four quads or something like that.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: It's not really something really big.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: You know, a lot of scope of work for them.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: They have it just a normal room.
**Christian.mcdonald**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: I mean just the caveat to that is the only call out I'll make is we really need that room probably by 1st of August because I got a terminated connection in there pretty quick.
**Bclymer**: So we can light up the building, start testing.
**Chris.query**: I mean timeline is going to be your guys biggest thing because like, you know, we're going to turn around in numbers, you know, and get as fast as we can.
**Chris.query**: But the biggest thing is, you know, to get released and get drawings done.
**Chris.query**: You know, to get.
**Chris.query**: To get stuff moving, you know, by some of these timelines is it's advantageous to.
**Chris.query**: To get in as fast as possible.
**Chris.query**: That's quick.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: We can do these on the MDF room, put it as a alternate cost on the side.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: So then we know.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Because I don't want to start mixing stuff between GC and now Elliot on the lighting.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: So we want to break it down into different scope of work and then, you know, get confused between quotes or like proposals.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: So, you know, you can put it as a option or at least to give me cost.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Just see, just at the end we say, okay, we go to Alito.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Then I say, oh, okay, now you can add this in the LED lighting and then I know you can go ahead and add it to your, to your permit.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: So that's what I think.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: What I need to know is the cost.
**Chris.query**: Okay, that's what we'll do.
**Chris.query**: Hermes, when do you.
**Chris.query**: So we get.
