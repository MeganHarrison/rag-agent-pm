## Transcript
**Sclevenger**: Today you look very tall.
**Cmortensen**: Do I look tall?
**Cmortensen**: There we go.
**Cmortensen**: Look at me next to the building.
**Cmortensen**: I'm not that tall.
**Sclevenger**: Well, still from that distance, you're about halfway up on the building.
**Cmortensen**: There we go.
**Cmortensen**: That's awesome.
**Cmortensen**: The first time anyone said I look tall.
**Sclevenger**: Are you not.
**Cmortensen**: 5, 10?
**Cmortensen**: Average.
**Cmortensen**: Very average.
**Sclevenger**: Same here.
**Cmortensen**: Shortest in my family, though.
**Cmortensen**: My brothers are both 6, 1, 6 2.
**Cmortensen**: My dad's over 6 foot, so I'm the.
**Cmortensen**: I'm the runt of the litter.
**Sclevenger**: Yeah.
**Sclevenger**: Oh, that's all right.
**Cmortensen**: Here.
**Cmortensen**: Guessing Sean's gonna jump on.
**Cmortensen**: Right.
**Cmortensen**: I can ask and give her a couple minutes.
**Cmortensen**: Hey, Sean.
**Cmortensen**: Can everybody hear me?
**Cmortensen**: Okay?
**Bclymer**: See, I cannot.
**Bclymer**: Let me see if it's.
**Bclymer**: Oh, I'll try it.
**Cmortensen**: I can hear you.
**Cmortensen**: Can you hear me now?
**Bclymer**: Yes, now I can hear you.
**Bclymer**: It was on my end.
**Cmortensen**: Okay, perfect.
**Cmortensen**: Okay, guys, so we started to save a little time.
**Cmortensen**: We started with our electricians there.
**Cmortensen**: Running pipe.
**Cmortensen**: Okay.
**Cmortensen**: Just so we could get a heads up.
**Cmortensen**: Carmel still has not issued my permit.
**Cmortensen**: Obviously, I started.
**Cmortensen**: So there's still four more people I see in the portal that need to review this amendment.
**Cmortensen**: And a little frustrating because it's more of a matter of them checking a box than anything.
**Cmortensen**: They just are the city and they can do what they want.
**Cmortensen**: So we're at their mercy there.
**Cmortensen**: However, I did start looking at comments from one of the plan reviewers, and a lot of them are minor.
**Cmortensen**: It's like they want us to add a lintel over the window for an architectural feature, which is fine.
**Cmortensen**: And then they want us to.
**Cmortensen**: They asked if we were adding sconces on either side of the entrance doors.
**Cmortensen**: So little minor details like that comment and correct.
**Cmortensen**: And the second round of review, Christina's telling me they don't take very long on it.
**Cmortensen**: So as soon as they get the final four people to add their comments, then it opens the portal for me to respond.
**Cmortensen**: So I met with the architect yesterday, and he's already working on making a couple of those changes.
**Cmortensen**: So as soon as they open that portal, I can submit.
**Cmortensen**: And then from there, it's just them saying, yep, responded to.
**Cmortensen**: Or we're good with that and hopefully I'll get a permit.
**Cmortensen**: We're going to try and do as much as we can up until that moment, but I will not be cutting openings, obviously, until we receive that permit.
**Cmortensen**: There was one comment that raised a very good question by them, and that was, what is FedEx going to do with their trash?
**Cmortensen**: And I don't have an answer for them.
**Bclymer**: So I know we looked into that at one time, at least on our end.
**Bclymer**: Let me, let me check with Grant who handles all of that here.
**Bclymer**: And.
**Bclymer**: Or they may be using our trash, I don't know.
**Cmortensen**: So if they are using your trash, which would make the most sense, the next question is how do they get their trash there?
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Cmortensen**: Which is, which is something we didn't think of because AAA way there's no sidewalk, so they can't go out that back door.
**Cmortensen**: I can look into maybe seeing what that would remember we have that little bit of contingency in there for this specific situation.
**Cmortensen**: The only other way.
**Cmortensen**: And, and we'll put our heads together.
**Cmortensen**: I'm going to ask Jesse what he thinks and Alex.
**Cmortensen**: And I'm open to any suggestions you guys have, but I know we have freezers along that wall, so we can't go there.
**Cmortensen**: The only thing would be cutting a hole somewhere in the demising wall and creating a common area for someone to essentially wheel a trash cart to the back.
**Sclevenger**: Yeah, we don't have a, we don't have a.
**Sclevenger**: And it's a compactor there inside our receiving room.
**Cmortensen**: Right.
**Sclevenger**: And a cardboard baler is all back in the receiving room.
**Cmortensen**: Right.
**Cmortensen**: So now when you empty your trash cans, I'm assuming you have dumpsters out back and you know, weekly, bi weekly, someone comes and.
**Sclevenger**: I don't think there is a dumpster outside.
**Sclevenger**: It's just that that compactor that all our trash goes in from the inside.
**Sclevenger**: We don't have an outside dumpster there to my knowledge.
**Cmortensen**: Okay, well, Alex, Alex is on here if you don't mind doing a little investigating, seeing what you, what you think when you're on site.
**Cmortensen**: And I'll try and swing by this weekend as well, guys and look at a Google Earth and see if we can't come up with any ideas.
**Cmortensen**: But we, we do have to respond to that comment with, with a logical solution with the hopes that they'll say yeah, that's okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I'll check with Grant also.
**Bclymer**: He'll.
**Bclymer**: I know that was discussed at one point and see what came up there.
**Cmortensen**: Okay.
**Cmortensen**: Yeah, I'm not sure what you, what you guys spoke with FedEx about too, and it obviously that.
**Bclymer**: Well, I'm not sure that anything went back to FedEx.
**Bclymer**: I'll have to ask him.
**Cmortensen**: Ultimately, you guys are the, are the landlord so they'll do what they have to, but we'll, we'll just, we need to be ready with a response here.
**Cmortensen**: So let's try and come up with a solution.
**Cmortensen**: Give the weekend to kind of think about it and then maybe reconvene Monday and see what the.
**Cmortensen**: See what we think is the best option and then we can respond.
**Cmortensen**: Assuming they opened the portal by end of day tomorrow for me to respond to their comments.
**Cmortensen**: That's.
**Cmortensen**: That's the only.
**Cmortensen**: That's the only one I foresee causing issues.
**Cmortensen**: All the other ones are piddly stuff that we're going to take care of with the architect just changing some notes.
**Cmortensen**: But the trash one was the biggest one I wanted to review with you guys.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Cmortensen**: Okay.
**Cmortensen**: So from a scheduling standpoint, we have everybody lined up at the drop of the drop of the hat to just hop on cutting these openings.
**Cmortensen**: Alex has been keeping the subs updated.
**Cmortensen**: As soon as we.
**Cmortensen**: We have that, we'll.
**Cmortensen**: We'll get going.
**Cmortensen**: I think this.
**Cmortensen**: This wall is going to go up pretty quick.
**Cmortensen**: And with the confirmations that.
**Cmortensen**: That FedEx is going to go ahead and just pull their own permit, I.
**Cmortensen**: I'm still confident of being done in that first week of September.
**Cmortensen**: But FedEx also took a long time to get me their updated sign stuff and I made them pretty aware of that.
**Cmortensen**: So as far as handing it over the 1st of September, I cautioned James a little bit at that.
**Cmortensen**: And I just want to let you guys know I'm trying to stay ahead of that to get.
**Cmortensen**: To give us as much time as possible.
**Cmortensen**: So I know that was agreed on in the lease.
**Cmortensen**: So I just want to let you guys know that I'd rather push it back a week maybe and then with the hopes of, you know, finishing early and giving them.
**Cmortensen**: Giving them something there.
**Sclevenger**: Okay.
**Cmortensen**: Any questions for me?
**Sclevenger**: I don't have any.
**Bclymer**: None for me.
**Cmortensen**: Okay.
**Cmortensen**: Jesse, you got anything?
**Ahuettl**: No, I'm good.
**Ahuettl**: I'm good.
**Ahuettl**: Happy to see this thing get going.
**Cmortensen**: Yeah, me too.
**Cmortensen**: Me too.
**Cmortensen**: So I.
**Cmortensen**: We're pushing hard, guys.
**Cmortensen**: We're trying to get as much done as possible to ahead of time without Caramel being able to sniff us out.
**Cmortensen**: So.
**Cmortensen**: Alrighty.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, sounds great.
**Sclevenger**: Sean, can you stay on a minute after?
**Sclevenger**: Yeah.
**Sclevenger**: I need to talk to you about some other stuff.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Sclevenger**: All right.
**Cmortensen**: Okay, guys.
**Cmortensen**: And you have my cell phone, so give me a call if anything pops up.
**Cmortensen**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: Thank you very much, you guys.
**Ahuettl**: I was going to shut off this fireflies.
**Ahuettl**: It keeps on recording the meeting, so.
**Bclymer**: Oh, okay.
**Sclevenger**: I can call her if it's a thing.
**Sclevenger**: Jesse.
**Ahuettl**: Well, let me see if I can do this for you.
**Ahuettl**: I've done it where I forgot it on for like hours and it sends out the transcript.
**Ahuettl**: I'm saying.
**Cmortensen**: I'm like, oh, boy.
**Ahuettl**: I cuss too much for this to be on.
**Ahuettl**: I don't know how to shut this thing off.
**Ahuettl**: Here, let me see here.
**Ahuettl**: Fireflies.
