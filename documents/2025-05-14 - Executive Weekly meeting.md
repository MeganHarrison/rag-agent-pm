## Transcript
**Bclymer**: Eight.
**Speaker 1**: Hi, can you hear me?
**Bclymer**: I can.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: So I was checking the magazine thing.
**Speaker 1**: I think it's too expensive, to be honest.
**Speaker 1**: For what we're just, you know, just a logo plate new.
**Speaker 1**: I mean, without the logo placement, it's just like almost 5k.
**Speaker 1**: So I think it's too much.
**Speaker 1**: So I don't think we're just.
**Speaker 1**: I mean, and I look at it and it seems like they also are.
**Speaker 1**: I mean, they're probably sending to a lot of partners, so that's okay.
**Speaker 1**: But I don't think we need to participate.
**Speaker 1**: We have three magazines.
**Speaker 1**: I really follow up with them, just asking them for, you know, outcome and input and what's happening in metrics.
**Speaker 1**: So I'll keep you posted on that.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: For merchandising, waiting on Tyler to give me the update on the estimating time so we can start ordering some for the St.
**Speaker 1**: Pete office, Arkansas, I think was already sent by Andrew.
**Speaker 1**: So that's done.
**Speaker 1**: What else is done in terms of everything?
**Speaker 1**: He's already sent all the emails, payroll, background check, everything is done on his site.
**Speaker 1**: So that's good.
**Speaker 1**: And then what else I have is here.
**Speaker 1**: What happened?
**Speaker 1**: Okay, so you send it to the event on June.
**Speaker 1**: So we're waiting on their adding us to in the insurance part.
**Speaker 1**: So that's good.
**Speaker 1**: And then what else?
**Speaker 1**: Did you receive the cards from Florida yesterday?
**Bclymer**: The.
**Bclymer**: For the office?
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, but the person came like, is Ashley okay?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, good.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, that's good.
**Speaker 1**: So that's done.
**Speaker 1**: And then.
**Speaker 1**: Yep.
**Speaker 1**: I think we're ready for my side.
**Bclymer**: For.
**Bclymer**: So let's, let's get some.
**Bclymer**: Some poos ordered from that guy for down here.
**Bclymer**: And then so we'll do the.
**Bclymer**: So I don't know if we.
**Bclymer**: I don't know if we have in our.
**Bclymer**: In our policy about like clothing or anything, but if we.
**Bclymer**: If we don't, let's.
**Bclymer**: Let's create something.
**Bclymer**: So every new employee I want to, you know, gets three Polos.
**Bclymer**: And then you'll get three Polos every year.
**Speaker 1**: And then each year.
**Speaker 1**: Is there anything else you want to give?
**Speaker 1**: Like cups that.
**Speaker 1**: You were talking about yeti cups and USB drives?
**Speaker 1**: No, no.
**Bclymer**: I mean the USB drives are for closeout documents to give to clients.
**Bclymer**: And then the cups and stuff.
**Bclymer**: I was just asking to have some at the offices, but that's not super important.
**Bclymer**: It's not something that we need to.
**Bclymer**: Need to do.
**Bclymer**: All right, perfect.
**Bclymer**: Do you know, so in.
**Bclymer**: In our notion here, so we have two types of transactions that get coded through this.
**Bclymer**: Credit card transactions and direct Costs where companies send us an invoice and it gets coded.
**Bclymer**: Okay, where in here can I find the direct cost?
**Bclymer**: The invoices, not the credit cards like the invoices do.
**Speaker 1**: You know, not to be honest with you, I know there was something that Fritz actually wanted to have some here notion.
**Speaker 1**: One second.
**Speaker 1**: So here is an accounting Costco.
**Bclymer**: I think it's pending invoices is what it is.
**Speaker 1**: Pending invoices.
**Bclymer**: It's accounting pending invoices.
**Speaker 1**: And you need the.
**Speaker 1**: Not the invoice.
**Speaker 1**: What do you need exactly?
**Speaker 1**: The Costco.
**Bclymer**: No, it's.
**Bclymer**: I just wanted to know where the.
**Bclymer**: I just found it.
**Bclymer**: I just wanted to know where this was at.
**Bclymer**: That's.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, that's exactly what I wanted to know.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: It's probably a million question, but I don't know.
**Speaker 1**: Ending.
**Speaker 1**: No.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, everything is coming here.
**Speaker 1**: No.
**Bclymer**: And then.
**Bclymer**: And then.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, so.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: And then.
**Bclymer**: So you probably want to make a.
**Bclymer**: You know.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: If we don't have a database yet for the.
**Bclymer**: Who's the project manager associated with each job, you know, we need to.
**Bclymer**: Need to have that connected.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Speaker 1**: So.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Because we have only.
**Speaker 1**: Jesse.
**Speaker 1**: Jesse.
**Speaker 1**: Jesse.
**Speaker 1**: Alex.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, well, I'll check that.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, now you remind me.
**Speaker 1**: I think they were asking something about people.
**Speaker 1**: Work people or people ready.
**Speaker 1**: So I think Fritzi wanted to know if you.
**Speaker 1**: If we have invoices from them.
**Speaker 1**: So we check.
**Speaker 1**: And you have never received some invoices from them.
**Speaker 1**: So it seems that the employees are paying with their card or we are paying with your card.
**Bclymer**: I mean, that shouldn't be the norm.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so I guess figure out who's doing that and everything.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So I'll check your emails and everything.
**Speaker 1**: We never receive an invoice like a specific invoice.
**Speaker 1**: So I think Fritzi asked them for actual invoices to you.
**Speaker 1**: So we'll check.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: And for this.
**Speaker 1**: For notion.
**Speaker 1**: I'll check because I have no idea what these invoices.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: What else you need for me?
**Speaker 1**: What else?
**Speaker 1**: I'm working on.
**Bclymer**: That's kind of the biggest stuff, I think.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: No, I already talked to payroll because they didn't add some truck allowances and the phone allowance to Mike to John Parsons.
**Speaker 1**: So now they have to pay next week.
**Speaker 1**: So I make sure with Angela just to make sure that every employee.
**Speaker 1**: Not every employee, but every time I send the offer letters, those are the ones that it should be automatically added to the portal.
**Speaker 1**: So we're working on that.
**Speaker 1**: So that's good.
**Speaker 1**: And then.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, just making sure he will receive that next paycheck.
**Speaker 1**: So that's good.
**Speaker 1**: And then, yeah, everything is ready with the Stampede office.
**Speaker 1**: Don't forget.
**Speaker 1**: I'm pretty sure they send you something as well to set up rooms and conferences and everything.
**Bclymer**: Oh, I don't know if I.
**Bclymer**: I don't have it.
**Bclymer**: I mean.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, I have it.
**Speaker 1**: So whenever you guys need it, I already set it up.
**Speaker 1**: So if you guys need a room or anything, let me know so I can go and select and click and schedule for us.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: We have to pay for that?
**Speaker 1**: No, that's part of the listing.
**Bclymer**: No, that's good.
**Speaker 1**: And then also working on the design for the listing.
**Speaker 1**: So everything was sent, so they just need to update it.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: Well, yeah, why don't you order, like, I'd say like 10.
