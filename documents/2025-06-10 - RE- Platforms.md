## Transcript
**Jdawson**: Good morning, everybody.
**Jpkennedy**: Morning, J.P.
**Jpkennedy**: good morning.
**Crusin**: Good morning.
**Jdawson**: So say good morning.
**Jdawson**: Jesse left.
**Jdawson**: What the heck is that?
**Jdawson**: Just leaves right away.
**Jpkennedy**: I had to shut my door.
**Jpkennedy**: It's an echo in here with all of us in the office.
**Jdawson**: No worries.
**Jdawson**: All right, so we got a sketch for the.
**Jdawson**: Our mysterious platforms.
**Crusin**: Yes, we do.
**Crusin**: Share my screen.
**Crusin**: All right, so I guess the first question would be.
**Crusin**: So we.
**Crusin**: We have scaled from these rectangles and it's giving us 20 by 8.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: That would be the.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, the measurements.
**Crusin**: So we have the platform itself Right here is 20 and 8 in width.
**Crusin**: So the question was with the staircase, if we could go beyond that or make this smaller and bring this staircase in a little more.
**Jdawson**: So the.
**Jdawson**: Sorry.
**Jdawson**: So the.
**Jdawson**: The surface of the platform is 20 by 8, right?
**Crusin**: Correct.
**Jdawson**: And what are you saying we need.
**Jdawson**: We want to do with the stairs?
**Crusin**: So I guess the question was, if.
**Crusin**: So the staircase goes beyond that 20.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Because of the range.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay, gotcha.
**Crusin**: Is that okay or.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I don't know that.
**Jdawson**: That.
**Jdawson**: I mean.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, the plaque.
**Jdawson**: Because there's, as you can see on the drawing.
**Jdawson**: I mean, there's a little bit of space there.
**Crusin**: Right.
**Jdawson**: I mean, so we were just thinking of.
**Jdawson**: But it's a good point.
**Jdawson**: I can confirm that.
**Jdawson**: But yeah, because it's not.
**Jdawson**: I mean, there's space around it.
**Jdawson**: Right?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we want to.
**Jdawson**: Want to be cognizant of, you know, equipment moving around and all that stuff.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So you're saying the.
**Jdawson**: It'll come out.
**Jdawson**: How much further out does the.
**Jdawson**: Do the stairs come?
**Crusin**: So we have.
**Crusin**: Right now we have it at 3ft extra.
**Crusin**: And we were thinking if we could even do a ladder or something.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Crusin**: Just to try to save some space.
**Crusin**: We had something like this, for example.
**Crusin**: It could you just have a ladder or.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, okay.
**Jdawson**: And.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, and we have.
**Jdawson**: And they.
**Jdawson**: They just did this Sunday night and just said this is just an FYI.
**Jdawson**: They had down at one of our other sites, they're bringing up guardrail and stuff like that.
**Jdawson**: And they had.
**Jdawson**: They had some.
**Jdawson**: They had some platforms, but they were more.
**Jdawson**: I shouldn't say they're platforms.
**Jdawson**: There are more of those walkways that go over conveyors.
**Jdawson**: So that had stairs up and then a little steel platform and then, you know, stairs down the other side.
**Jdawson**: They have some of those stairs that they thought they might be able to use.
**Jdawson**: But I said, you know, if we're just going to be building this, it may be, you know, just be easier to integrate the stairs in with the build versus.
**Jdawson**: All right, we're going to give you the stairs and you build around them, so to speak.
**Jdawson**: But yeah, so I think those.
**Jdawson**: I have to take a look at those stairs and see what the pitch on those were because they may.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I'll see if I can get a picture of those.
**Jdawson**: So we have to figure out the stairs and the other question I have for my team is do they need like.
**Jdawson**: So this is great.
**Jdawson**: First of all, I appreciate it.
**Jdawson**: You know, do they want accessibility from both sides?
**Crusin**: Gotcha.
**Jdawson**: Would they want to set a stair similar on the other side?
**Jdawson**: So, right.
**Jdawson**: So I guess we need, you know, do we need two sets of stairs?
**Jdawson**: That's one question.
**Jdawson**: And that is it.
**Crusin**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: If the stairs come out three feet past the platform and I gotta get, I gotta get measurements on the existing stairs because I don't know if they're steeper and would be easier to integrate.
**Jdawson**: I mean, I don't think it would be a problem using them and fastening them to the structure.
**Jdawson**: But I also think it'll look a little kludgy because they're like the yellow steel stairs that you use on conveyance platform.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: But I'll get the measurement on those existing stairs that.
**Jdawson**: And see what they would look like.
**Jdawson**: And then the third part I see, I'm assuming the, the, the uprights there at the, at the, the pla.
**Jdawson**: At the, I guess.
**Jdawson**: What do we call the counter?
**Jdawson**: We'll call it the counter are for TVs, right?
**Jdawson**: So.
**Crusin**: Yes.
**Crusin**: So I think this, this platform is for.
**Crusin**: I think for Latchat.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Crusin**: And then this would be, I guess it would depend where you guys would set up the TV.
**Crusin**: But these could act as blocking for mounting.
**Crusin**: The TV's on.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So I have to figure out like my assumption was.
**Jdawson**: And again, I gotta determine this.
**Jdawson**: And that's.
**Jdawson**: This was one of the things I was like, guys, what.
**Jdawson**: What do you mean by poles for mounting?
**Jdawson**: I mean, we're not just gonna, you know, sort of a pole.
**Jdawson**: I mean, and it really is like these are observation platforms.
**Jdawson**: So you have what is standing height?
**Jdawson**: Like what, you got 16ft high, right?
**Jdawson**: So what height are those TVs?
**Jdawson**: Like, I guess my concern would be, you know, can we still observe the floor for all the TVs blocking the view?
**Jdawson**: You know what I mean?
**Jdawson**: So, yeah, so what.
**Jdawson**: What height do you think they would be right now?
**Crusin**: I think we have these at.
**Jdawson**: Approximately.
**Jdawson**: It's fine.
**Jdawson**: I mean.
**Crusin**: I guess that could, it could change depending on how you guys would.
**Jpkennedy**: You know what size these TVs are, JP?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that's what I have down is what size are the TVs, which they won't know.
**Jdawson**: And, and you know, what height do we need?
**Crusin**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, because I was also part of it was.
**Jdawson**: I was originally thought maybe they're coming down, you know, like, you know, they're, they're taking a, you know, a pole and mounting it to the joists and dropping them right from the ceiling.
**Jdawson**: Because, you know, I thought mounting them to.
**Jdawson**: You got to be careful.
**Jdawson**: Like, what are these, what are the sizes of the.
**Jdawson**: Are these like four by four posts?
**Crusin**: Correct?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So they're decent.
**Jdawson**: They're substantial.
**Jdawson**: So I mean, you know, from a weight standpoint, I don't think, you know, obviously built to hold the TVs, but it's really like, how, how high would they be up?
**Jdawson**: So what, I'm sorry, what did you say was that kind of that viewing area in there?
**Jpkennedy**: So if you're.
**Jpkennedy**: Yeah, if you're six foot to the platform and the top of that is 10 foot up, say you got a 32 inch monitor.
**Jpkennedy**: You know, the bottom of that monitor is going to be about 8 foot.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jpkennedy**: Off the deck.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: It's a curious thing.
**Jdawson**: I just don't.
**Jdawson**: I didn't know.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I know.
**Jdawson**: This is.
**Jdawson**: I understand why I put them there.
**Jdawson**: And that's one of my questions for my folks.
**Jdawson**: Like, are they.
**Jdawson**: You know, so it's.
**Jdawson**: So Basically, if you're 6 foot, you can see through there to the floor, but if you're, if you're taller, you may, you may be blocked.
**Crusin**: Right.
**Crusin**: I mean, I guess another option would be to have one of these running up top here, four by four.
**Crusin**: And we don't have to have these blocking.
**Crusin**: And we can just hang the TVs from here.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Like just have them from the top.
**Crusin**: Right.
**Crusin**: They can just attach and coming down.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, because, I mean, there's not going to be a lot of weight, I don't think.
**Jdawson**: But let me.
**Jdawson**: All right, so that's good.
**Jdawson**: So let me give us some of the workers.
**Jdawson**: Because they kept saying, can we just mock something up?
**Jdawson**: I said, well, and they meant like physically.
**Jdawson**: And I said, well, no, we don't want to just start mocking something up and then tearing shit down.
**Jdawson**: This is not, you know, so, jp.
**Adelgado**: The, the deal is somebody would be, somebody would be standing there Speaking and the TVs are behind them, correct?
**Jdawson**: Well, yeah, that's what I got to get.
**Jdawson**: Like, is this, you know, can we just turn it around then?
**Jdawson**: Like, are the monitors supposed to be.
**Jdawson**: That's one of my questions.
**Jdawson**: Would Be are the monitors, you know, because if you look at the other way, obviously there's no obstruction.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: You can see the floor.
**Jdawson**: And would the monitors.
**Jdawson**: Is it okay that I would say the monitors are behind them in this, in this and they're, they can look out the other, you know, other side, but they wouldn't necessarily, you know, have 360 view.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: So that's what I got to get.
**Jdawson**: Like what are they, what are they really observing?
**Jdawson**: And you know, if we orient the, orientate these towards the right way, then that's fine.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, let me.
**Jdawson**: I'll get this morning.
**Adelgado**: One thing you, one thing you could look at is doing a.
**Adelgado**: Basically like a cantilever.
**Adelgado**: So like on one, you know, the one of the right side, for instance, you could have that to where that TV can swing and then swing out so it's mounted to like a unistrut or something.
**Adelgado**: And then that way you could move it in or out if, if you need a 360 degree view.
**Adelgado**: Right.
**Adelgado**: So if you're, if you're facing forward, it's right behind you, but you want to face backwards.
**Adelgado**: Then that TV would swing out and then would face the opposite direction.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Now I guess you're saying.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, so there's ways to do this.
**Jdawson**: I just got to get a little more detail from them.
**Jdawson**: And that's why I told them the best thing to do is just get a drawing so we can, I mean the platform I think is pretty.
**Jdawson**: I mean we're good.
**Jdawson**: I don't think there should be much change there.
**Jdawson**: It's just really how we mount these TVs and, and what the, you know, what their size is and like do they need 360 view or not?
**Jdawson**: So I will pose those questions to our ops team this morning and then.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, and then we can get their feedback and adjust and then, you know, get you get cost on and get you to go ahead and start building.
**Jdawson**: Because I gotta get.
**Jdawson**: Like I mentioned with the, with the schedule notes I had last night, I gotta.
**Jdawson**: They seem to be.
**Jdawson**: This seems to be our COO's pet child.
**Jdawson**: So I don't know how quickly he's gonna want them so.
**Jdawson**: Or at least see one of them.
**Jdawson**: Right?
**Jdawson**: At least get one of them built.
**Jdawson**: So anyway, let's get the design done first.
**Jdawson**: We need to know whether we need two sets of stairs.
**Jdawson**: We need to know if the current stairs coming out three feet past the platform is okay.
**Jdawson**: What do the stairs coming from our other site look like if we wanted to integrate them, size of TV's height of the mounting and do they need a 360 view of the floor?
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: All right, cool.
**Jdawson**: No, this is great.
**Jdawson**: I appreciate the effort here because they were all like, oh, we gotta.
**Jdawson**: They were trying to build us out of scrap, scrap platform steel that we had.
**Jdawson**: And I said, Jesus, gonna start, you know, welding.
**Jdawson**: And I said, why don't we just like build a deck?
**Jdawson**: I said, shouldn't be.
**Jdawson**: But it shouldn't be that big a deal.
**Jdawson**: Get some pressure treated drywood, plywood and four by fours and freaking build a platform.
**Jdawson**: It's, you know.
**Jdawson**: Anyway, we don't need to over over engineer these things, but obviously they need to be safe, so.
**Jdawson**: And neat code.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: Okay, can you send this to me?
**Crusin**: Yes.
**Crusin**: I'll send you some different views with the screenshots of mine.
**Jpkennedy**: Yeah.
**Jpkennedy**: But I would get rid of those bottom three pieces of wood that cross that other side.
**Jpkennedy**: There's just no need for all them.
**Jpkennedy**: These TVs, like I say they don't weigh anything anymore.
**Crusin**: Yeah.
**Jpkennedy**: And you could actually mount them directly to one of those posts that's sticking up.
**Jpkennedy**: So you're getting rid of all that.
**Jpkennedy**: What they'll think is blocking the view.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that might just be the thing if we, you know, you have that.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: And I'll just confirm like are the TVs behind them?
**Jdawson**: Are they standing there at that platform and is the platform height or.
**Jdawson**: I'm sorry, the.
**Jdawson**: I'll say the.
**Jdawson**: The counter.
**Jdawson**: I'll call that the counter.
**Jdawson**: So what is the counter height there for or.
**Jdawson**: No, it doesn't have.
**Jdawson**: What is the counter height there?
**Crusin**: This one?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Is that like standing or sitting?
**Crusin**: Sitting.
**Jdawson**: So you know, I need to confirm counter height because I think, you know.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I don't know if these people are sitting up there.
**Jdawson**: Okay, that's fine.
**Jdawson**: Let's put it that way.
**Jdawson**: I just got to confirm, you know, I wasn't sure if they're standing or sitting, so I guess.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I mean are they just sitting there monitoring like traffic control and then they have their monitors above them, you know, so.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: No, that.
**Jdawson**: That looks good.
**Jdawson**: And I'm.
**Jdawson**: And it's just like I said, this is just out of.
**Jdawson**: What's the material?
**Jdawson**: You know, we have retro treated wood and anything.
**Jdawson**: Any other specific materials or like laminate or anything like that on top of the.
**Jdawson**: I don't care.
**Jdawson**: I'm just curious what other materials you're using.
**Jpkennedy**: I think we were just figuring plywood for the deck and then we can get, you know, a pre manufactured like laminate countertop.
**Jpkennedy**: Like a bar with top to put up along that back side with brackets to hold it up.
**Jpkennedy**: And then just the backsplash too may be too high.
**Jpkennedy**: I figured you only want like a 4 inch probably backsplash to keep stuff from knocking over.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, you could probably.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Have that.
**Jdawson**: Really whatever that is that six inches or.
**Jdawson**: I said one foot right now that's at one foot.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I mean it wouldn't need to be any more than six inches or four.
**Jdawson**: Really.
**Jdawson**: Four inches probably.
**Crusin**: Right, okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I would just do make that change.
**Jdawson**: So just so we leave that.
**Jdawson**: Because I have a sense they're going to want to be able to see around and whether the front is where the TVs are or the front is the other direction.
**Jdawson**: Like I'm kind of thinking that that front there is where it's going to be facing the floor.
**Jdawson**: You know what I mean?
**Jdawson**: Facing the center of the floor.
**Jdawson**: So then they can sit there, observe.
**Jdawson**: They can look up and see their monitors with metrics.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that's what I'm kind of thinking.
**Jdawson**: So I just need to make sure orientation is the other question.
**Crusin**: Right.
**Crusin**: Yeah.
**Crusin**: I was thinking if they could have just, just the TVs here and maybe this platform could be here facing the other way.
**Crusin**: Oh.
**Crusin**: Or if they want them all in.
**Jpkennedy**: The same one thing too.
**Jpkennedy**: Jp, when you talk to them, if the space, you know, for the traffic or the lifts and stuff like those stairs could be on the front instead of on the sides.
**Crusin**: Right, right.
**Jpkennedy**: You know, if the 8 foot dimension going to 11 makes more sense than the 20 foot dimension going to 23 foot.
**Jpkennedy**: That's the easy thing especially, you know, they'll just stick frame all this on site.
**Jpkennedy**: So that's an easy move when they decide what works best for you.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, no, we could, I'm sure we'll figure out.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: With the, you know, how the stairs can, can integrate best without any, you know, any obstruction.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I mean, yeah, just yeah.
**Jdawson**: Make those couple modifications.
**Jdawson**: You can send them to send that to me and I'll get their feedback.
**Jdawson**: So we don't, you know, go trying to recreate the wheel here and they have certain, you know, certain specs they haven't informed us of yet.
**Jdawson**: I don't want to try and do try and figure out every permutation.
**Jdawson**: Let us give them more.
**Jdawson**: We need more information on it, but I think a little bit more we can get it, get it handled.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jpkennedy**: All right, sounds good.
**Jdawson**: All right, excellent.
**Jdawson**: Thank you.
**Jdawson**: Appreciate the effort.
**Jdawson**: And yeah, send me some this morning I'll get it to them.
**Jdawson**: We'll get some hopefully feedback by tomorrow and maybe we can discuss it while we're on site as well.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jpkennedy**: Okay, now, did you have time, JP to go over the new scope and those drawings for Avon showing?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I got like five minutes.
**Jpkennedy**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, so there's not a lot I haven't.
**Jdawson**: I'll get the cat to you today.
**Jdawson**: There's really.
**Jdawson**: What they did was I highlighted on the scope that there were.
**Jdawson**: There were already.
**Jdawson**: We had already put in a couple workstations in the case sort area.
**Jdawson**: Let me just share my screen while I'm doing it.
**Jdawson**: So that's the wrong one.
**Jdawson**: Where's the drawing?
**Jdawson**: Drawing, drawing, drawing.
**Jdawson**: Right up there.
**Jdawson**: No, where did I just have it.
**Jdawson**: Let me find it again.
**Jdawson**: And where do I.
**Jdawson**: Oh, okay.
**Jdawson**: Added up.
**Jdawson**: Now we're gone.
**Jdawson**: Where's that PDF from the other day?
**Jdawson**: That's the cad.
**Jdawson**: There we go.
**Jdawson**: All right, now I can share.
**Jdawson**: I don't share that.
**Jdawson**: There we go.
**Crusin**: All right.
**Jdawson**: Share the right screen.
**Jdawson**: There we go.
**Jdawson**: All right, so this is the.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, like I said, I'll get you the cat.
**Jdawson**: But basically what they did was you had a.
**Jdawson**: Originally the drawing only went to this transfer lane was only the Amazon part.
**Crusin**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: They added in the changes to little sleepies.
**Jdawson**: So this is the entire.
**Jdawson**: You know, this is sort of the end state of the entire facility now.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: So what the scope had was.
**Jdawson**: I'd already sent you that.
**Jdawson**: We were adding a workstation here and a workstation here.
**Jdawson**: But we hadn't shown it on a drawing.
**Jdawson**: She just put it on the drawing.
**Jdawson**: So you.
**Jdawson**: It's in the scope.
**Jdawson**: And now you can see there's a drop here and a drop here for a workstation.
**Jdawson**: And then the same thing goes for these two stations up here.
**Jdawson**: The upper left, they're the B2B stations just right on the demising wall there.
**Jdawson**: So those were already added to the scope of work.
**Jdawson**: They're now just actually shown on the drawing.
**Jdawson**: Nothing else has really changed.
**Jdawson**: I did send you the.
**Jdawson**: They want to add, I guess, dock locks and fans to dock doors up here.
**Jdawson**: So I sent you that change because they need to have more.
**Jdawson**: More outbound doors there.
**Jdawson**: So I mean, that's really what the drawing was about.
**Jdawson**: Getting us an overall drawing and then showing those few extra workstations that were not included.
**Jdawson**: All the rest of this stuff, none of the pit changes.
**Jdawson**: I am going to go over there is the bathroom trailers and then the temporary break room is here.
**Jdawson**: I'm going to go over that this week while I'm on site with our ops team.
**Jdawson**: So it'll be a little more electrical.
**Jdawson**: We're also going to need you guys to get.
**Jdawson**: Do some fencing, internal fencing here, get a sub to do that to build this.
**Jdawson**: We.
**Jdawson**: I think we have the materials coming in from another site to basically build this fencing area as well as this current fence line goes straight down.
**Jdawson**: We're jogging it out and repurposing some of the fencing and, you know, kind of reconfigured to make it a little wider for people to come in and out.
**Jdawson**: But this fence line is going to.
**Jdawson**: Existing fence line is going to change.
**Jdawson**: There's some.
**Jdawson**: Some fencing that we need.
**Jdawson**: I'll get you a drawing and we can talk about, you know, what that would look like.
**Jdawson**: So there's more odds and ends that we don't.
**Jdawson**: Typically what's happened is typically I would have, you know, our facilities people on site just take care of this.
**Jdawson**: But I.
**Jdawson**: We.
**Jdawson**: We've had organizational changes and we basically have one facility guy for the whole building.
**Jdawson**: So he can't.
**Jdawson**: He can't handle, you know, projects essentially.
**Jdawson**: He doesn't have time to do that.
**Jdawson**: So we're just gonna have you guys do it.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: Because you can just hire a fencing contractor and get it done, and then I don't have to manage every freaking thing.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, so I'll send you a drawing.
**Jdawson**: So there'll be a little fencing work that needs to be done.
**Jdawson**: Not a major deal.
**Jdawson**: I'll get the timing when that needs to be done.
**Jdawson**: But yeah, that was all change was really okay.
**Jpkennedy**: And then real quick, so we got all the equipment ordered, we got the.
**Jpkennedy**: The approved bumpers ordered, and we got like, what else.
**Jpkennedy**: What do we need to put in the initial PO because we're still kind of.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that's fine.
**Jdawson**: I would base it on that.
**Jdawson**: That latest scope of work I sent you.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: As far as your initial cost.
**Jpkennedy**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: Just base it on that version three, I think that was sent you.
**Jdawson**: I'm just saying that you, you know, here.
**Jdawson**: So what I would do would be, I make sure.
**Jdawson**: I mean, it's.
**Jdawson**: It's basically the dock doors and then the.
**Jdawson**: The electrical.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Is the main.
**Jdawson**: Two main pieces of that.
**Jdawson**: So I would like to just see, you know, separation, like, you know, dockdoor costs, you know, that themselves and then.
**Jdawson**: Then all the electrical work.
**Jdawson**: But other than that, I would just include that scope document as what you're basing it on to keep it.
**Jdawson**: Keep it fairly simple.
**Jdawson**: And then as we add stuff, whether.
**Crusin**: It'S.
**Jdawson**: Other stuff for little sleepies or the fencing or I think they want.
**Jdawson**: Gonna want some guardrail up somewhere.
**Jdawson**: I forget.
**Jdawson**: But I still have some.
**Jdawson**: Like I said, I have to confirm.
**Jdawson**: Are, you know, are you furnishing and installing it or are you just installing what we have?
**Jdawson**: And then, you know, if we're providing the materials, you know, your sub is gonna want to take a look at what.
**Jdawson**: What we're providing before they provide pricing.
**Jdawson**: So anyway, yeah, there's probably some.
**Jdawson**: Like I said, there's some fencing and some guardrail and there's going to be other odds and ends, but we'll just handle them as kind of like change orders or, you know, individual, you know, projects.
**Jdawson**: But you can use just that scope document as the baseline just so I can get some cost because I know we had the 30.
**Jdawson**: The 30 initial dock doors.
**Jdawson**: So what would be helpful too is what the.
**Jdawson**: You have the cost for the 30 initial, which we had a budget number in for the additional 20 to 22 lights, fans and power.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: To all that.
**Jdawson**: I need that as a separate line item because that obviously was not in our original budget.
**Jpkennedy**: These chargers for the.
**Jdawson**: And then.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, and then we had 10 pit chargers.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, so you can include.
**Jdawson**: All right, I want it all included.
**Jdawson**: But then, you know, as a line on the 10 pit chargers are X the feed.
**Jdawson**: And then adding 28 is another.
**Jdawson**: So I can say to them, look, you know, we originally, when we went out for sort of budget pricing, this is where we were thinking you added 20.
**Jdawson**: Some dock door locations with dock locks, fans and power.
**Jdawson**: You added 28 new PIT charging stations, you know, just so I can explain to them, you know, why the cost is going to be higher than they thought.
**Jdawson**: I mean, the workstations, I don't, I don't even know if we, we.
**Jdawson**: If we plugged in a number or what we did for budget.
**Jdawson**: But, you know, there's essentially 101 workstations or something like that.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, like I said, you can just base it on that scope of work and.
**Jpkennedy**: Okay, yeah, we'll.
**Jpkennedy**: We'll analyze it, break it out.
**Jpkennedy**: So the initial cost, you know, how much was added, if it's the same scope or if it's a new scope all together, how much that is.
**Crusin**: I don't.
**Jpkennedy**: And we'll get that over to you as soon as possible.
**Jdawson**: Perfect.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: All right, cool.
**Jdawson**: Thank you, guys.
**Jdawson**: I will be.
**Jdawson**: I'll be talking to you, I'm sure, later today or definitely tomorrow.
**Jdawson**: So thanks.
**Jpkennedy**: You bet.
**Jpkennedy**: Thanks.
**Jdawson**: All right, have a good one.
**Jdawson**: See you.
**Jdawson**: Thank you.
**Crusin**: Waiting.
