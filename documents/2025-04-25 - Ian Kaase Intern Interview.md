## Transcript
**Bclymer**: Went to Ball State and he first was majoring as a teacher.
**Bclymer**: And he's like, I have seen how much teachers made him.
**Bclymer**: Like, wait a minute, I need to do something else.
**Bclymer**: So, yeah, got into that.
**Bclymer**: But, like, it's good because, like, we need to reach out.
**Bclymer**: I mean, I've worked for large GCs most of my career, and the best ones is always a intern or co ops.
**Bclymer**: Back in the day, we called them.
**Bclymer**: And it's interesting.
**Bclymer**: I've, you know, I was a superintendent for a long time and then I switched to project management, the PM side, and did that too.
**Bclymer**: And all these field engineers that.
**Bclymer**: And co ops that work for me are all vice presidents and, you know, senior leaders of companies.
**Bclymer**: You know, it's just a great way to learn, you know.
**Bclymer**: And I was at a company, MJ Harris, and the, you know, the internship there, they had a lot of people from Auburn because Auburn University has a big construction management program.
**Bclymer**: And I don't know.
**Bclymer**: What year are you in?
**Ijkaase**: I'm a junior.
**Bclymer**: Your junior.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And like, they would start, you know, freshmen, you know, they would do four internships and so they'd spend first one in the field.
**Bclymer**: Next one they'd be in the office working and estimating.
**Bclymer**: The next one they would go work with a pm and then they do one more in the field just because it's, you know, the, the best construction managers.
**Bclymer**: You know, you got to know what you're building before you can be really a PM and buy the materials and write the subcontracts to know, like, what the subs are doing and, you know, the materials they need to buy it.
**Bclymer**: So that's a good thing, that it's just a good thing to learn.
**Bclymer**: And so it'll be good, like the amount of information you can earn.
**Bclymer**: You know, we have several projects going on that you could go in, you know, in the field and you know, also in, you know, in the office, we can get some time where you can spend with the guys doing the estimating, you know, with the project managers.
**Bclymer**: And it's a lot of good experience, paid experience.
**Bclymer**: So I, I don't know.
**Bclymer**: What kind of rate were you looking at hourly?
**Ijkaase**: I honestly am just looking for the experience.
**Ijkaase**: I'm not really worried about that.
**Ijkaase**: As long as it pays for my gas, I'm good.
**Bclymer**: Oh, yeah, no, it does that.
**Bclymer**: I think.
**Bclymer**: I'm thinking it was 18 an hour that we had, I believe, set up for that, so.
**Ijkaase**: Gotcha.
**Ijkaase**: I actually took a, like in one of my classes right now.
**Ijkaase**: We're doing takeoffs and estimating.
**Ijkaase**: And I got to do that in one of my classes is just like a lab.
**Ijkaase**: And it was a lot of fun.
**Ijkaase**: I'm excited to learn a little bit more.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: I mean, there's a certain amount of takeoff, especially if we're just shooting budgets to people.
**Bclymer**: You gotta do some of that.
**Bclymer**: In most of our work we have subcontractors, you know, we, you know, it's a good thing.
**Bclymer**: I like the fact you're.
**Bclymer**: Are you somewhat proficient with cad?
**Ijkaase**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Revit.
**Bclymer**: And you know, our estimator that works for us, you know, we have two architects that work for us as well that, you know, a lot of our clients will just come to us say, hey, here's the space I have.
**Bclymer**: What can I build here?
**Bclymer**: Yesterday the guy sent me a.
**Bclymer**: Basically a sales brochure from like, it's a piece of.
**Bclymer**: It's a lot piece of real estate.
**Bclymer**: And he's like, I want to build our own office.
**Bclymer**: And then like a strip mall, like four more offices.
**Bclymer**: So I send that to our architect.
**Bclymer**: He draws it up, we tell him how much you want to spend and then you can figure out what kind of finishes you do.
**Bclymer**: And you kind of.
**Bclymer**: You basically design it.
**Bclymer**: We're design, build.
**Bclymer**: So we're designing to their budget for what they want.
**Bclymer**: And you know, it's just a.
**Bclymer**: It's a great thing.
**Bclymer**: I mean, we, our clients love us.
**Bclymer**: So it's a, it's a good thing.
**Bclymer**: But yeah, you'll be able to, you know, get a good feel for a lot of different things here over the summer.
**Bclymer**: And like, what is your, what is your.
**Bclymer**: The timing of that?
**Ijkaase**: So I'm basically good to start whenever.
**Ijkaase**: So I get outta class May 9th and then so like that following Monday, I think it's the 12th, I could be good to start.
**Ijkaase**: And then I do actually I'm going on a, like a study abroad faculty led trip over the summer from May 26 to June 11.
**Ijkaase**: So I wouldn't be able to work in that time span.
**Ijkaase**: But then after that I'd be good till like August 15th, I think.
**Bclymer**: Is it like.
**Bclymer**: So June 12th to the.
**Bclymer**: I don't know what the dates are.
**Bclymer**: Is that like a Sunday or something?
**Ijkaase**: I think that's like a Friday.

**Ijkaase**: I'm sure I can check.
**Bclymer**: 26 is a Monday.
**Bclymer**: The 11th, it's a Wednesday.
**Bclymer**: 11th Wednesday.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And then you go back to school.
**Bclymer**: July, I think August 15th or August.
**Ijkaase**: Somewhere around there.
**Ijkaase**: I'm not exactly sure.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And do you have like living Accommodations in Indianapolis.
**Ijkaase**: Yeah, I.
**Ijkaase**: So my family has a house in Peru, so I'd probably just drive from there every day.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: And, like, how did you find us?
**Ijkaase**: So my girlfriend, her grandpa has, like, a.
**Ijkaase**: A foreign business, and he's really good friends with a guy named Lots Pinier.
**Ijkaase**: And so he said he recommended this company for me and.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Ijkaase**: Supplied online.
**Bclymer**: Who does?
**Bclymer**: Like, what's the name of the company?
**Ijkaase**: Say it again.
**Bclymer**: The flooring company is.
**Ijkaase**: Oh, it's called Shillings.
**Ijkaase**: It's in South Bend.
**Ijkaase**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: I don't.
**Bclymer**: I haven't worked with them before, but.
**Ijkaase**: Yeah, he just recommended it.
**Ijkaase**: This was a really good company.
**Ijkaase**: I think he knows the president, Brandon.
**Ijkaase**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, Brandon started this.
**Bclymer**: I've known Brandon for over 10 years.
**Bclymer**: We worked together for a general contractor in Florida.
**Bclymer**: That's where I live.
**Bclymer**: I live in Clearwater, Florida.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: We got an office in St.
**Bclymer**: Pete, and we worked together like 10 years ago.
**Bclymer**: He is actually my assistant, PM and just became good friends and he started his business three years ago, and I joined him about a year ago.
**Bclymer**: Got to be the right time.
**Bclymer**: So, like, we're just blowing up, like, in the last year.
**Bclymer**: It's crazy, all the stuff we're getting.
**Bclymer**: So it's exciting stuff here, but yeah, it's a great, you know, because that's what we're looking for.
**Bclymer**: You, you know, do an internship in the summer when you get out of school, you got a job waiting for you.
**Ijkaase**: So do you do a lot of commercial work in Florida, too?
**Ijkaase**: Like, I noticed that a lot of them were like, factories and stuff near Indy.
**Bclymer**: But yeah, we do do healthcare commercial.
**Bclymer**: We don't really do residential work other than, like, we're doing, you know, meeting with a developer here next week.
**Bclymer**: We've been doing a proposal for town homes.
**Bclymer**: So if it's multi family, we'll do that.
**Bclymer**: But, like, single homes is not really our thing.
**Bclymer**: But yeah, all commercial.
**Bclymer**: Brandon does a lot of work with warehouse.
**Bclymer**: You know, that is kind of where he got started was doing that.
**Bclymer**: We do that all over the country.
**Bclymer**: And, you know, in.
**Bclymer**: In Indiana, Goodwill is a giant, you know, a very big client of ours.
**Bclymer**: We've got like four or five jobs going on with them.
**Bclymer**: We build their Excel center schools, and in Bloomington, we're doing a.
**Bclymer**: One of their retail stores.
**Bclymer**: Right now we're finishing up an Excel center in Bartholomew County.
**Bclymer**: That's Columbus, Indiana.
**Bclymer**: Hopefully we'll get our final inspection passed today and get that one done.
**Bclymer**: But yeah, they.
**Bclymer**: We're their favorite contractor, so it's just like constant steady work with them.
**Bclymer**: We're doing.
**Bclymer**: We have a client, we're building the Westfield Collective.
**Bclymer**: That's probably a job you'll get to go to and spend some time in the field.
**Bclymer**: It's there in Westfield, just north of Indy, and it's a indoor volleyball court.
**Bclymer**: They've got ext.
**Bclymer**: Outdoor volleyball courts, and then it's bars and restaurants, like, next to it.
**Bclymer**: It's a really cool concept.
**Bclymer**: And they have projects we're also doing in Georgia and one of them in Florida here.
**Bclymer**: So they've been.
**Bclymer**: We are also looking at something in Kentucky for them.
**Bclymer**: It's.
**Bclymer**: There's just stuff all over the place, you know, and, you know, as we grow, grow, we're just hiring, hiring to keep up with all the projects we're getting.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: And if, you know, anyone else at your school that's in that program is looking for a place, I mean.
**Ijkaase**: Yeah, I might have a few friends that might need an internship.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I mean, definitely.
**Bclymer**: We want to get it started, like, especially at schools where, you know, every year we get at least, you know, one student wants to come and do the internship in the summer and, you know, as we get that going and then they can spend each summer here.
**Bclymer**: It's very helpful.
**Bclymer**: You learn the process and that's most of it.
**Bclymer**: Like, you know, the GCs do things differently, you know, I've found.
**Bclymer**: But there's really only one.
**Bclymer**: What I would say is correct way to do things because, you know, you can, you know, some of them don't do very good reporting and they don't do, you know, much accounting of, you know, the.
**Bclymer**: The status of their jobs and, you know, the status of the construction.
**Bclymer**: That's what becomes a problem for companies, why they.
**Bclymer**: They don't make it or they don't grow.
**Bclymer**: So that's what we have is a very good set of systems in place here.
**Bclymer**: And it's just learning how things go.
**Bclymer**: But construction's not.
**Bclymer**: It's not rocket science.
**Bclymer**: So that's why I'm in it, I guess.
**Bclymer**: But it's.
**Bclymer**: It's a very good industry to be in.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, so that's good.
**Bclymer**: Like, I mean, everything sounds good.
**Bclymer**: Like, you're hired.
**Bclymer**: I can send you an offer letter and I'll just put in there about, you know, your start date, you said, was May 12th.
**Ijkaase**: Yeah.
**Ijkaase**: Double check that.
**Ijkaase**: That's a Monday.
**Ijkaase**: But yeah, May 12th works out.
**Bclymer**: May 12th.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: The 12th through the 26th, you know, so basically two weeks.
**Ijkaase**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: To the 23rd, and then you're gone until the 11th.
**Bclymer**: So you're going to give up your, your water park duties this summer.
**Bclymer**: I've seen that on your resume.
**Bclymer**: You did that every year.
**Ijkaase**: Yeah, so I was a canoe guide, so I would take like, can't, like so it's at camp, but I would take like these kids out and like last year I went into Canada every other week fishing with them, and it was a lot of fun.
**Ijkaase**: But I need to get an internship.
**Ijkaase**: I'm looking forward to the experience, so.
**Bclymer**: Heck, yeah.
**Bclymer**: Well, I'm a big fisherman down here in Florida.
**Bclymer**: Go offshore.
**Ijkaase**: Thanks.
**Bclymer**: I have a boat that we go 80, 100 miles offshore sometimes to go fishing and just catch so much.
**Bclymer**: I just love it.
**Bclymer**: Grouper and snapper and, you know, mahi mahi.
**Bclymer**: And there's just so much stuff you can catch out there.
**Bclymer**: It's.
**Bclymer**: It's a lot of fun.
**Ijkaase**: Yeah, I haven't gotten to fish in the ocean yet, but I'm really looking forward to the day I get to, so.
**Bclymer**: Oh, yeah.
**Bclymer**: Do your next internship.
**Bclymer**: Well, I guess so.
**Bclymer**: You're going to be a.
**Bclymer**: You're a junior now and next year is your last year.
**Ijkaase**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Work and maybe by then, if you want to relocate to Florida, just move on down here.
**Bclymer**: But it's addictive, I can tell you that.
**Ijkaase**: Yeah, I get that.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So that's good.
**Bclymer**: So I'll put that in.
**Bclymer**: I'll get you an offer letter sent over.
**Bclymer**: Be the 12th through the 20s, 20th, I think 23rd.
**Bclymer**: 23rd and then the 12th through the August 18th.
**Ijkaase**: Works well for me.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: Looking forward to it.
**Ijkaase**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: You'll be our recruiter for that.
**Bclymer**: Your college there for sure.
**Bclymer**: Like a lot of.
**Bclymer**: I don't know if they have the job fairs or things like that, but a lot of construction companies will actually have a booth set up and.
**Ijkaase**: Yeah, we have a few of them.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Ijkaase**: Not very many construction companies come to them.
**Ijkaase**: It's mostly just like local to Terra home, so.
**Bclymer**: Oh, really?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I hear you.
**Bclymer**: Good.
**Bclymer**: Well, sounds good.
**Bclymer**: Looking forward to it.
**Bclymer**: Anything else you want to know about us?
**Bclymer**: I mean, where our office there is.
**Bclymer**: And I'm not from Indianapolis, so I've been there a hundred times.
**Bclymer**: I usually come up to Indiana every couple weeks, but it's northern part of Indianapolis.
**Ijkaase**: Yeah, I saw that.
**Ijkaase**: Like Southern fishers.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So that's good.
**Bclymer**: We'll get you.
**Bclymer**: We'll get you lined up.
**Bclymer**: Great.
**Ijkaase**: Well, I appreciate it.
**Ijkaase**: Thank you for your time.
**Bclymer**: All right, thanks, Ian.
**Ijkaase**: Bye.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, we'll see you.
