## Transcript
**Ataylor**: These.
**Rthompson**: What do you say?
**Rthompson**: Yeah, they need eight quads at every one of these, and then four duplexes for TVs.
**Rthompson**: They want four quads on this side, four quads on this side, and then four collections for TVs.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, that's what Kevin said.
**Speaker 2**: I'm telling you what JP told me.
**Speaker 2**: So.
**Rthompson**: Okay.
**Speaker 2**: Ultimately, he.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Rthompson**: I.
**Speaker 2**: All I can tell you is we only need one circuit for TVs, and.
**Speaker 2**: And one circuit for.
**Speaker 2**: For them to hook up a power strip, too.
**Ataylor**: For.
**Speaker 2**: It's just charging laptops, and then we'll have the RFDS on there, which is technically CO2.
**Rthompson**: So.
**Rthompson**: Yeah, if they're just doing laptops, then I mean, we could still do, like four quads, but just.
**Rthompson**: I mean, really, all this could be on one circuit.
**Speaker 2**: And that's fine if we can just give them one circuit.
**Speaker 2**: Let's do it.
**Rthompson**: Yeah.
**Rthompson**: I mean, you could charge a buttload.
**Speaker 2**: Of laptops with one circuit and plug in TVs.
**Rthompson**: Yeah.
**Rthompson**: I mean, a laptop charger, like, my.
**Rthompson**: Mine's only, like, 180 watts.
**Ataylor**: All right.
**Rthompson**: Which is.
**Rthompson**: That's.
**Rthompson**: That's one receptacle and a half amps.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, it's one and a half amps.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Rthompson**: Well, yes.
**Rthompson**: I mean.
**Speaker 2**: Well, then let's do.
**Speaker 2**: Let's do those on one circuit and then the RFD on another.
**Rthompson**: The.
**Rthompson**: What'd you say?
**Speaker 2**: Whatever the scanners are.
**Rthompson**: Oh.
**Rthompson**: So.
**Rthompson**: Yeah, I don't even.
**Rthompson**: I don't even know where those are at, to be honest with you.
**Speaker 2**: I think they're at each.
**Speaker 2**: Each command center.
**Rthompson**: Oh, are they?
**Speaker 2**: Yep.
**Rthompson**: Then, okay, how many is there?
**Speaker 2**: Just be one quad at each command center for them.
**Rthompson**: And what are they?
**Speaker 2**: There's scanners for checking in stuff and checking it out, I think.
**Rthompson**: Okay, so if we.
**Rthompson**: If we was to split each command center into two circuits, you know, that would.
**Rthompson**: I mean, if it's just a scanner, it's nothing more than the laptop power, essentially.
**Ataylor**: Can I ask a silly question?
**Rthompson**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: Is.
**Ataylor**: Is Alex with you?
**Ataylor**: Brennan?
**Rthompson**: Is Alex.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Rthompson**: No.
**Ataylor**: Okay, can we just get, like, the.
**Ataylor**: My silly question is, do we have some metals on the equipment that's getting installed at these locations and we can just run the numbers and make sure we're good?
**Ataylor**: I mean, if we know there's scanners or, you know, laptop chargers or whatever going at these workstations, we could just plug the.
**Ataylor**: The actual numbers in and make sure we're right.
**Speaker 2**: I.
**Speaker 2**: I just want to do.
**Speaker 2**: I.
**Speaker 2**: I get what you're saying, Robert.
**Speaker 2**: Especially so we don't have to go back and we want to give them.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, yeah, I'm just, I'm just going off of what he sends me.
**Speaker 2**: So like RF charging stations provide 120amp.
**Speaker 2**: That's all it needs.
**Speaker 2**: 120amp.
**Speaker 2**: 120 volt.
**Speaker 2**: 20 volt circuit with quad receptor receptacle to each charging cage.
**Speaker 2**: These charging cage is, are going to be at each command center.
**Speaker 2**: So there's four of those.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Rthompson**: The TVs don't take hardly any power.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Rthompson**: And I mean, I know my laptop charger is 180 watts.
**Speaker 2**: So here's one.
**Speaker 2**: He, he.
**Speaker 2**: We have, we have too many dedicated circuits on this CO1.
**Speaker 2**: And so what, what I'm after is with this.
**Speaker 2**: And can I share my screen real quick?
**Rthompson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: With this change order, can we cover four of these?
**Speaker 2**: Right.
**Speaker 2**: And then we have 19 time clocks at five locations.
**Speaker 2**: So it's going to be basically 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 more dedicated.
**Speaker 2**: So nine dedicated circuits essentially.
**Rthompson**: Okay, so you want to deduct.
**Speaker 2**: From.
**Rthompson**: You want to deduct.
**Rthompson**: We got 16 circuits at command centers.
**Rthompson**: We need to reduce that down to probably 8 and then add all the 19 time costs and RFP.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, you're telling me that the TVs and charging laptops can be on one circuit, right?
**Speaker 2**: Or do you want to be safe and call it two circuits?
**Rthompson**: So like in a house you can do.
**Rthompson**: It's 180 blocks per receptacle in a house.
**Rthompson**: So you can put 13 on a circuit.
**Rthompson**: 12 or 13.
**Rthompson**: So yeah, I'm saying for the command centers we could do.
**Rthompson**: Yeah, we could do all that on one circuit per command center.
**Speaker 2**: Right.
**Speaker 2**: And then we'll add another circuit for the RF chargers.
**Speaker 2**: So that covers it.
**Speaker 2**: So that's eight right there, right?
**Rthompson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: And then that leaves us eight left.
**Speaker 2**: And this one's basically five.
**Speaker 2**: I'm saying.
**Speaker 2**: So I mean, we're covered five locations.
**Speaker 2**: I mean you could run three, three time clocks on one dedic dedicated circuit.
**Ataylor**: Right.
**Speaker 2**: One quad, plug them all in.
**Rthompson**: Yeah.
**Rthompson**: So the only, the only catch will.
**Ataylor**: Be.
**Rthompson**: I need to look and see where these columns are at.
**Rthompson**: Because if we gotta run like a, you know, several hundred feet, we might have to run like a big feeder, you know, like a number six or something for those circuits.
**Rthompson**: But I mean, it's not gonna be nothing crazy.
**Speaker 2**: What, five grand?
**Rthompson**: Probably.
**Speaker 2**: Unless then I'll just, I'll just add five grand onto your number.
**Speaker 2**: I'm trying to get rid of the paperwork.
**Speaker 2**: I mean, because we gave it an allowance.
**Speaker 2**: I know we've reused some whips and it all.
**Speaker 2**: And like, I don't want to waste the time of having to add it up.
**Speaker 2**: I think you guys are going to come out ahead, to be honest with you.
**Speaker 2**: And I owe that to you for trying to scrimp, scrimp your number down.
**Speaker 2**: I mean, we, we had to cut 100, and because of the partnership, we're like, all right, we're going to cut our fee.
**Speaker 2**: I can't even believe Brandon did it.
**Speaker 2**: We gave him.
**Speaker 2**: I mean, hell, I'll just show you guys because usually I'll pad numbers, but look at this.
**Rthompson**: Well, he told me he had to shake 140,000.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, we ate 140 grand.
**Speaker 2**: This was my price to them.
**Speaker 2**: I mean, I got low GCS, right?
**Speaker 2**: I put a little money on yours for GCS.
**Speaker 2**: Like 16,000, I think, was your original.
**Speaker 2**: It was like, I think you were at like 6 and some change, right?
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, I put 16, like 470.
**Speaker 2**: That, that basically covers an extra three weeks of my time in a superintendent's.
**Speaker 2**: And then all of these are hack costs.
**Speaker 2**: And then our fee was, you know, 106.
**Speaker 2**: That's 10 on top of my total cost.
**Speaker 2**: And then we gave them 140 grand.
**Speaker 2**: We're basically doing this for free.
**Speaker 2**: Just, just so you guys know.
**Speaker 2**: I'm not asking you to do it for free.
**Speaker 2**: You got people to answer to.
**Speaker 2**: But we want to do all the Amazons across the nation.
**Speaker 2**: That's kind of where we came at it.
**Speaker 2**: So out of doing that, we got a meeting with, with the COO of radio, which is huge for us.
**Rthompson**: Well, and listen, if you guys chase all nation.
**Rthompson**: We're trying to do.
**Speaker 2**: So what you say?
**Speaker 2**: I'm sorry, you cut out.
**Rthompson**: I said, if you're, if you're chasing Amazon across the nation, we're trying to go with you.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, no, I know.
**Speaker 2**: So that's why I'm like, if I can tell them that this stuff is covered in this one, that would, that would help me out a lot because like I said, I'm.
**Speaker 2**: I know more paperwork's coming, but this would save just the hassle.
**Speaker 2**: I still got to get you guys a freaking contract.
**Speaker 2**: So that's what I want to get done today.
**Rthompson**: Okay, well, listen, we're.
**Rthompson**: We're also going to combine some of the walkie jacks.
**Rthompson**: We had dedicated circuits to all them.
**Rthompson**: So we're going to combine some of.
**Rthompson**: I think we can do two per circuit now.
**Rthompson**: We know.
**Rthompson**: So, yeah, I mean, I, I think we'll, we'll be able to work it out.
**Speaker 2**: All right, well, I really appreciate it.
**Rthompson**: Yep.
**Rthompson**: Let me get Woody looped in to get our drawings to match what we talked about, and then we'll get them out to the guys and hopefully they haven't started on any of that yet.
**Ataylor**: They haven't.
**Ataylor**: Not this stuff, I don't think.
**Ataylor**: I talked to Wayne about getting on the EV charger, so he's on that.
**Ataylor**: He's still doing the drops.
**Speaker 2**: I just made this and sent this to J.P.
**Speaker 2**: okay.
**Speaker 2**: So, like, this is like a.
**Speaker 2**: Original workstation drops.
**Speaker 2**: I know we may have one or two.
**Speaker 2**: Right.
**Speaker 2**: You know, EV truck chargers.
**Speaker 2**: William told me it take them three to four days, so I got that getting done next week.
**Ataylor**: Longer than that.
**Ataylor**: It's gonna take longer than three or four days, is it?
**Ataylor**: I think so.
**Ataylor**: To get the breakers installed, we gotta shut the gear down, we gotta pull the feeders, terminate them.
**Ataylor**: I mean, maybe he'll surprise me, but I.
**Ataylor**: I mean, I would have plugged 10 days in there myself, but that's just me.
**Speaker 2**: I got eight.
**Speaker 2**: I got you finishing Monday.
**Speaker 2**: He wanted it done by 7:3.
**Speaker 2**: I said, no, we'll be done.
**Speaker 2**: I'm sending him this.
**Speaker 2**: We're done Monday.
**Speaker 2**: So, I mean, it'll.
**Ataylor**: And we're off on Friday, right?
**Ataylor**: So.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, I hope so.
**Speaker 2**: I hope so.
**Ataylor**: I know you're a ball buster, man.
**Speaker 2**: Nah, man, I'm.
**Speaker 2**: I'm.
**Speaker 2**: I got Friday blanked out, dude.
**Speaker 2**: We're good.
**Ataylor**: But, yeah, it's going to be, you know, we're on it now.
**Ataylor**: I talked to him.
**Ataylor**: I said get, you know, jump on the EV chargers.
**Ataylor**: But I would be.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, I would be surprised if it's done by next Thursday.
**Speaker 2**: Well, bust his balls on it.
**Speaker 2**: And I got pit chargers.
**Speaker 2**: I gave you 14 days for pit chargers.
**Speaker 2**: That's like you guys are going to be done before then.
**Ataylor**: Oh, we still got to get the panels and up, right, Brandon.
**Speaker 2**: I got it starting.
**Speaker 2**: I got it starting Monday.
**Speaker 2**: I gave you 14 days.
**Ataylor**: That's working panels.
**Ataylor**: Brennan, those pit chargers need those two new panels.
**Rthompson**: The big chargers.
**Rthompson**: The same with the walkie jacks and the.
**Speaker 2**: No, that's a part of CO1.
**Ataylor**: Pit Chargers are the 28.
**Ataylor**: There's 23 on one side, five on the other.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, those are for the forklifts.
**Rthompson**: For the.
**Rthompson**: For the big chargers.
**Rthompson**: We got to put 400amp manuals in.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, I know.
**Ataylor**: That's what I'm telling AJ.
**Ataylor**: Like, we got a panel to put in.
**Ataylor**: We got to feed it out of the gear.
**Ataylor**: We got to run all the pipe.
**Ataylor**: I mean, that's.
**Ataylor**: There's a Lot of work there.
**Speaker 2**: I mean, that's 14 working days.
**Speaker 2**: That's three.
**Speaker 2**: That's pretty much three weeks starting on Monday.
**Ataylor**: I get it.
**Ataylor**: Just being honest.
**Ataylor**: You told me.
**Ataylor**: He told me to be honest with you.
**Ataylor**: I'm just like.
**Speaker 2**: I've seen.
**Speaker 2**: I've seen.
**Ataylor**: I would have to put six guys over there, two guys on the service would take eight days, probably, to mount the panel, the disconnect, put the breaker in, pipe it into the switch gear, schedule the shutdown, pull the feeders, terminate everything, get the panel done.
**Ataylor**: Then I would have two guys piping up the pit, chargers on the wall, getting all the pipe up and the plugs installed and the wire down.
**Ataylor**: Then I would have a crew of guys pulling MC from the wire way up in the ceiling across for probably six or seven days.
**Ataylor**: So, yeah, I'm not saying it can't be done.
**Ataylor**: I just.
**Ataylor**: I'm trying to balance what you want done and the manpower we have on site, you know, like, we're gonna be on it, man.
**Ataylor**: I just.
**Ataylor**: You know, there's a shutdown with the switch gear.
**Ataylor**: It's probably gonna have to happen on a weekend, and it's just a little bit of.
**Ataylor**: I gotta get that panel.
**Ataylor**: Is that panel ordered?
**Ataylor**: Brennan.
**Speaker 2**: Y' all better have that conversation offline.
**Speaker 2**: If it's an answer, I don't want to hear.
**Ataylor**: You're breaking up, Brennan.
**Ataylor**: I don't know.
**Ataylor**: And where you're at in the portal or something.
**Rthompson**: You guys hear me now?
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Rthompson**: So the shutdowns.
**Rthompson**: We need to talk about that.
**Ataylor**: I mean, I'm gonna be on site tomorrow.
**Ataylor**: We need to look at them all because we got galore.
**Speaker 2**: So I'm gonna send this to you guys.
**Speaker 2**: These are our.
**Speaker 2**: Our dates.
**Speaker 2**: We gotta try to hit.
**Speaker 2**: All right?
**Speaker 2**: That way it's all on paper.
**Speaker 2**: And like I said, I'm out of pocket tomorrow, but next week.
**Rthompson**: I'll.
**Speaker 2**: I'll put my.
**Speaker 2**: I know how to put conduit in.
**Ataylor**: Oh, we got you, aj.
**Ataylor**: I'm just.
**Ataylor**: I'm just kind of thinking through the numbers you're throwing at us.
**Ataylor**: I just.
**Ataylor**: We're on it.
**Ataylor**: I just.
**Ataylor**: We're fine, man.
**Ataylor**: Don't.
**Ataylor**: Don't worry.
**Ataylor**: We're gonna do a good job.
**Ataylor**: I just.
**Ataylor**: Some things I need and some shutdowns and stuff.
**Ataylor**: We need to get all this done, so.
**Ataylor**: But, yeah, we're.
**Ataylor**: We're here and we're committed.
**Ataylor**: We're not gonna.
**Ataylor**: We're not gonna drop the ball.
**Ataylor**: I just.
**Ataylor**: I might need a day or two.
**Speaker 2**: I know.
**Speaker 2**: I know.
**Speaker 2**: You won't Are they gonna crucify us.
**Rthompson**: If we miss a date?
**Speaker 2**: Are they gonna.
**Speaker 2**: I mean, I.
**Speaker 2**: I'm gonna get crucified.
**Speaker 2**: Okay, that's.
**Speaker 2**: That's all I can tell you.
**Ataylor**: So when are they bringing the pit charger equipment so we can wire it in?
**Speaker 2**: It starts arriving 77.
**Rthompson**: Well, Robert, I think we're just doing 480 twist locks, so they can.
**Ataylor**: We are, but, I mean, we got.
**Ataylor**: I know, but it's just like getting it done, you know, and then are they going to be bolting it down in our way?
**Ataylor**: That's the other thing.
**Ataylor**: You know, I don't want to work over them, so.
**Rthompson**: Well, all right.
**Rthompson**: So, A.J.
**Rthompson**: can I share my screen for a minute?
**Rthompson**: Because I have a question.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, I'm just sending you that schedule.
**Rthompson**: Never mind.
**Rthompson**: Oh, for these guys here.
**Rthompson**: What.
**Rthompson**: What are we mounting all these to?
**Rthompson**: Is there a guardrail?
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, yeah, guardrail's getting installed.
**Rthompson**: When's that going to be installed?
**Ataylor**: Why?
**Ataylor**: What are those?
**Ataylor**: Oh, those are those new pallet jacket things.
**Rthompson**: They're.
**Rthompson**: They call them walkie.
**Ataylor**: So.
**Ataylor**: So.
**Ataylor**: So we need to do SO drops, right?
**Speaker 2**: Well.
**Rthompson**: Well, could do.
**Speaker 2**: You could do like, a couple SO drops onto the.
**Speaker 2**: And then run.
**Speaker 2**: Run pipe on the.
**Rthompson**: So Robert, me and William were talking about maybe, like, if there's guardrail we mount, we do like, a pipe drop with, you know, however many circuits, and then mount strut to the guardrail with conduit and boxes running down.
**Speaker 2**: I mean, you can.
**Speaker 2**: You can mount your.
**Speaker 2**: Your conduit right to the guardrail.
**Rthompson**: Hey, Robert, what do you think?
**Ataylor**: I think you do MC in the deck and drop.
**Ataylor**: So core down and be done with it.
**Ataylor**: You prefab everything and you go up there and hang it and be done.
**Speaker 2**: But you don't want them.
**Speaker 2**: You don't want them flopping around.
**Ataylor**: For.
**Rthompson**: Every one of these.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, the whole building's full of SO cord.
**Speaker 2**: I.
**Speaker 2**: I think so I got a little mom and pop electrician doing locust chargers at Brownsburg.
**Speaker 2**: And the only reason I did that, guys, is because you guys are covered up.
**Speaker 2**: And this is, like, it's not much work, right?
**Speaker 2**: They needed, like, four locust chargers done.
**Speaker 2**: And.
**Speaker 2**: Or it was like 10, and.
**Ataylor**: We.
**Speaker 2**: Did an so drop.
**Speaker 2**: You could put, like, four on one circuit for these or three on one circuit.
**Speaker 2**: So we did an so drop down.
**Speaker 2**: Down to the guardrail, and then we.
**Speaker 2**: We mounted basically rubber so with boxes on it.
**Speaker 2**: We're gonna mount the boxes to.
**Speaker 2**: To the guardrail, and then that's how we have our NEMA plugs on There.
**Speaker 2**: I mean, it's like.
**Speaker 2**: I don't think you need one for every single one.
**Speaker 2**: That's.
**Speaker 2**: That's a lot.
**Speaker 2**: But I'll let you guys do it how you want.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, I would put a quad, you know, for every two.
**Ataylor**: So I'd have 1, 2, 3, 4.
**Ataylor**: I'd have like eight core drops on one side and 1, 2, 3, 4 on the other.
**Ataylor**: Okay, we'll figure it out.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, it's not a big deal.
**Ataylor**: We're on it.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, I say that to say I'm okay with the.
**Speaker 2**: The.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, I don't think we need 25 drops right there, though.
**Rthompson**: Well, that's what I'm trying to.
**Rthompson**: Is if we could.
**Rthompson**: I don't know.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, that's.
**Speaker 2**: That's a part of CO1, though.
**Speaker 2**: So, like.
**Rthompson**: Yeah, that's what I was telling you.
**Rthompson**: We're going to combine these.
**Rthompson**: We can put.
**Rthompson**: Instead of having 15, 17, 19, 15, and 17, we're going to combine to one circuit.
**Rthompson**: 19, 21.
**Rthompson**: We're going to make one circuit.
**Speaker 2**: Yep.
**Ataylor**: So we'll have half the circuits.
**Rthompson**: Yeah, essentially, we'll have half the circuits, so.
**Rthompson**: So some of that.
**Rthompson**: That credit will go towards CO2.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, I think we're.
**Speaker 2**: We're covered.
**Speaker 2**: I'm gonna tell them we're covered.
**Speaker 2**: Okay.
**Speaker 2**: All right.
**Rthompson**: So we all good?
**Speaker 2**: I think we're good, man.
**Speaker 2**: Are you guys good?
**Speaker 2**: I appreciate you.
**Ataylor**: Yep.
**Ataylor**: Good.
**Ataylor**: All right.
**Speaker 2**: Don't call me tomorrow, please, because I'm.
**Speaker 2**: I have a bad habit of answering my phone no matter what, and my wife will kill me.
**Ataylor**: Be in the moment, man.
**Ataylor**: Be in the moment.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: 4:00am we have an induction scheduled.
**Rthompson**: Is it your first?
**Speaker 2**: Yep.
**Speaker 2**: Baby boy.
**Rthompson**: Buddy.
**Speaker 2**: I won't be on site, but Alex will be there, like, next week.
**Speaker 2**: I'll.
**Speaker 2**: I mean, I.
**Speaker 2**: There's only so much I can do, right?
**Speaker 2**: I'll be working from home, obviously, but just call me if anything comes up, okay?
**Ataylor**: Yep.
**Ataylor**: We're good.
**Ataylor**: All right, buddy.
**Rthompson**: I'm gonna call you every day.
**Speaker 2**: That's fine.
**Speaker 2**: And I'm just gonna put.
**Speaker 2**: I'm just gonna put the phone in the baby's ear, and you'll just hear a baby crying.
**Rthompson**: See you, dude.
**Speaker 2**: See you.
