## Transcript
**Kmass**: Some dates and some durations to some of this stuff and then kind of go from there.
**Rcarmen**: I'll try to give you what I can.
**Kmass**: Yep, understood.
**Kmass**: So you're able to see my schedule here?
**Rcarmen**: Yes.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Kmass**: All right.
**Kmass**: So after talking to Tony a little bit and you as well, looks like he's going to have some people out on site on the 16th, correct?
**Rcarmen**: Yep.
**Rcarmen**: Just to mark where all the demo is going to go.
**Kmass**: Yep.
**Kmass**: And then your email stated that the demo crew would be on site before 6:23 to start going after the door openings, correct?
**Rcarmen**: Yep.
**Kmass**: All right.
**Kmass**: Dock door material.
**Kmass**: Now, I know, like the doors obviously, and getting those openings closed up.
**Kmass**: Tony had said around 6:30 would be when the door material would be starting to arise.
**Rcarmen**: Okay.
**Rcarmen**: Yeah.
**Rcarmen**: Now is that the actual doors themselves?
**Kmass**: I do not know.
**Kmass**: He gave us about a six week lead time starting on, I think it was May 26th.
**Kmass**: He had placed an order on some stuff.
**Rcarmen**: Yeah.
**Kmass**: So that's kind of where that date comes from.
**Kmass**: 6:30.
**Kmass**: And he wasn't able to tell us exactly what was coming or this or that.
**Rcarmen**: Okay.
**Rcarmen**: Okay.
**Rcarmen**: I don't know when we're cutting the doors open, I mean, we're going to put some sort of, you know, a blank wood or board in there to just enclose them.
**Kmass**: Gotcha.
**Speaker 2**: Okay.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Kmass**: So that's something you guys will do is actually close those openings up until you get the actual door itself.
**Rcarmen**: Until the doors are ready to be installed.
**Rcarmen**: Yeah.
**Kmass**: Okay, perfect.
**Kmass**: And correct me if I'm wrong, but you.
**Kmass**: The plan is that by the.
**Kmass**: Sounds busy.
**Kmass**: You guys are going to go after or go after the door openings.
**Kmass**: Get those cut open, get some of those cut open and then follow back.
**Kmass**: Once you get the door material, then start slapping indoors.
**Kmass**: Then at the same time have that demo crew do the pits.
**Rcarmen**: Yeah, yeah.
**Rcarmen**: They'll probably start.
**Rcarmen**: I don't know, it'll be a day or two probably after they start the doors.
**Rcarmen**: Yeah.
**Rcarmen**: Just so they're not in the way of each other.
**Rcarmen**: And then start digging the pits out.
**Kmass**: Gotcha.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Kmass**: So if we kind of start installing those doors around 6:30, I put you guys on, I guess.
**Kmass**: How long do you think it's going to take them to knock out those.
**Kmass**: Those 30 door openings.
**Rcarmen**: 30 doors?
**Rcarmen**: That just the demo side of it.
**Kmass**: Yeah.
**Rcarmen**: Honestly, I don't know.
**Rcarmen**: I'd like to think they could do a couple a day.
**Rcarmen**: Yeah.
**Rcarmen**: Then it's a matter of putting in the framework and everything after that.
**Kmass**: Yeah.
**Kmass**: So I got you down for 15 days just to do the demo, which Would be just knocking out the opening and I guess somewhat getting that prepped and ready for the doors to go back in.
**Rcarmen**: Yeah, yeah.
**Rcarmen**: Weather contingent.
**Rcarmen**: Yeah, I'd say that should be about right.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Kmass**: All right, we'll leave it at that.
**Kmass**: The protection, I basically put it five days, but that's just going to be kind of tagging along with every opening that you guys get opened, I'm assuming.
**Kmass**: So I'll probably switch that around in probably like 10 days.
**Kmass**: Although it probably wouldn't take you very long to get them up and closed up.
**Kmass**: I could be wrong.
**Rcarmen**: Yeah, yeah.
**Rcarmen**: See the temp door?
**Rcarmen**: Yeah.
**Kmass**: All right.
**Kmass**: Then we got you for the material arriving around the 30th and then installing the doors.
**Kmass**: I got about 10 days for that.
**Rcarmen**: And that's on 30 doors.
**Rcarmen**: Yeah.
**Rcarmen**: Okay.
**Kmass**: Leave it.
**Kmass**: Or you think you want a couple extra days knowing that we gotta be.
**Kmass**: This is kind of our dock door completion date right here.
**Kmass**: We're looking around 9:15.
**Speaker 2**: I think you're muted.
**Speaker 2**: Brian.
**Speaker 2**: I can't hear you.
**Speaker 2**: You're still mute.
**Speaker 2**: Oh, she's gonna try to come back in, I assume.
**Kmass**: Yeah.
**Rcarmen**: Can you hear me?
**Rcarmen**: I'm not sure what happened.
**Rcarmen**: I hit a button and it logged me out completely.
**Rcarmen**: Sorry about that.
**Kmass**: No worries.
**Rcarmen**: So, yeah, the door install.
**Rcarmen**: From talking to Tony this morning, I think the door company, midwest door is looking to start either the first week of July.
**Rcarmen**: Obviously that's holiday week as well.
**Rcarmen**: So it may push off into the second week of July.
**Rcarmen**: But if you're.
**Rcarmen**: Look, if you're looking for doors installed by 9:15, I would say that we're fine with that.
**Kmass**: Yeah.
**Kmass**: Yep.
**Kmass**: So I'm just going to throw a seventh of July that bumps us to there.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Kmass**: Gives us about seven day gap in there.
**Kmass**: Just make a note real quick.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Kmass**: All right.
**Kmass**: So now down to the demo of the dock leveler pit.
**Kmass**: I kind of put 15 days in there.
**Kmass**: Again, similar to the demo of the doors.
**Kmass**: Not sure if that's going to take you more time or not.
**Rcarmen**: Well, if we're just digging the pits out because there's kind of a couple steps that go with that.
**Rcarmen**: When you got to dig the pit out, then you.
**Rcarmen**: You put the pit leveler or the.
**Rcarmen**: Not the leveler, but the pit tub in and then re pour back around it.
**Rcarmen**: So I.
**Rcarmen**: It might take a couple extra days.
**Kmass**: Got you.
**Kmass**: Yeah.
**Kmass**: So I have just for the demo of the.
**Kmass**: The actual opening.
**Kmass**: So then if you come down here, I got obviously the embedded tub kits.
**Kmass**: So that's a little bit further down and I Had that kind of jumping in between your demo dates.
**Kmass**: So if, like, if you guys are demo one.
**Kmass**: One pit, Are you going to demo all the pits and then come back, you think?
**Kmass**: Are you going to demo a couple of.
**Kmass**: Then get the actual levelers in or two separate crews?
**Rcarmen**: It'll be one crew that does the whole thing, and we can do it, you know, really however you want us to do it.
**Rcarmen**: We can put the tubs in at the same time that we dig the pit, or we can dig all the pits out and then come back around and put the tubs in.
**Kmass**: Gotcha.
**Rcarmen**: Or do 10.
**Rcarmen**: Do 10.
**Rcarmen**: 10 and 10.
**Kmass**: Right.
**Speaker 2**: So is the.
**Speaker 2**: Is it the same crew that cut the concrete out, that put the tarp in?
**Rcarmen**: Yes.
**Speaker 2**: Okay.
**Rcarmen**: Yep.
**Kmass**: So you got one crew that's doing all the demo, then also all the insole.
**Kmass**: Same guys?
**Rcarmen**: Yep, yep.
**Rcarmen**: Everything that.
**Rcarmen**: Yeah, yeah.
**Rcarmen**: The concrete company, they do a great deal of work for us with that, with door openings and pit cutouts.
**Rcarmen**: And pretty much what they do is they'll dig the whole pit out, put a tub in, and then pour the concrete back around it, and then we let it sit for a few days, and then we'll come back around and put a leveler in.
**Kmass**: Gotcha.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Kmass**: All right.
**Kmass**: So you're thinking a few more days?
**Kmass**: Well, demo.
**Kmass**: I only have 15 days, maybe.
**Kmass**: Maybe What I'll do is combined the demo plus the kind of make it.
**Kmass**: Make it all one thing so we're not so broke out here.
**Rcarmen**: Yeah, yeah, I think that would work.
**Kmass**: So anything that's got to do with the levelers are just going to be one line.
**Kmass**: I know.
**Kmass**: Anything that has to do with the doors will be one line item.
**Kmass**: The dock lovers will go up with those.
**Kmass**: So you're thinking how many days you think you need for it to complete the 30 total dock levelers?
**Kmass**: You think like 20 days?
**Kmass**: 25 days.
**Rcarmen**: Well, let's see.
**Rcarmen**: I'm figuring we can do about two to three a day, so I should know the math on that.
**Rcarmen**: But.
**Speaker 2**: Just to be safe, maybe 20 days?
**Kmass**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, yeah.
**Speaker 2**: If we do 10 a day.
**Speaker 2**: Would go faster doing 15 a day, though.
**Speaker 2**: Sorry, three a day or something?
**Rcarmen**: Yes, about three a day.
**Rcarmen**: So is that 10 days?
**Kmass**: Oh, you said you can do three a day at 10.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Kmass**: Right.
**Speaker 2**: So make it 15 days.
**Kmass**: Yeah, leave it at 15.
**Rcarmen**: Yeah, that works for me.
**Kmass**: Yeah.
**Kmass**: Gives you some wiggle room there.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Kmass**: Vehicle restraints.
**Rcarmen**: Restraints.
**Rcarmen**: If I'm being conservative, I'd say about five a day.
**Rcarmen**: I think we can probably do more, but just be conservative.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Rcarmen**: Is that the.
**Rcarmen**: Just the 30 at the new locations, not the 20 that you just added?
**Kmass**: Right.
**Kmass**: Exactly.
**Rcarmen**: Okay.
**Kmass**: So correct me.
**Kmass**: You said five a day.
**Rcarmen**: Roughly.
**Rcarmen**: Five a day.
**Rcarmen**: Yeah.
**Rcarmen**: Yeah.
**Rcarmen**: I want to say we could probably do more, but I would.
**Rcarmen**: I would feel good with, you know, seven to 10 days.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Speaker 2**: So that 10 days, would that include the extras that got added or.
**Rcarmen**: No, No.
**Rcarmen**: I mean, if we did, if we're able to do five a day, that's really six days to get all 30 of them installed.
**Rcarmen**: And I'm just giving myself some wiggle room there.
**Kmass**: Yep.
**Speaker 2**: So if we make it 15 days, would that include all of it, including the additional?
**Rcarmen**: We could probably do that, yeah.
**Speaker 2**: Okay.
**Rcarmen**: Include the additional 20.
**Kmass**: Yep.
**Kmass**: So we'll put you at 15 days for that.
**Kmass**: Golf levelers are going to go up with 15.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Kmass**: I don't know how you want to break this stuff down.
**Kmass**: Like the communication lights, dock seals, dock controllers, fan light combo, the.
**Rcarmen**: The red, green communication lights, those are the lights that go on the outside of the building for the truck communication.
**Rcarmen**: Those are generally done with the electrician or by the electrician when he's wired everything together.
**Rcarmen**: So he'll install those as well as any communication lights that go inside the building as well as the control box.
**Speaker 2**: So with those, do you guys determine where they get located or the electricity?
**Rcarmen**: We can assist with that.
**Rcarmen**: We've got plenty of drawings and kind of schematics that we get from Power Amp.
**Rcarmen**: They kind of know where they should go on the building.
**Rcarmen**: And I mean, I know we supplied that before to electricians just to know where to put them.
**Kmass**: Yeah, gotcha.
**Kmass**: Yeah, but would you guys mount the boxes?
**Rcarmen**: We would not know.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Rcarmen**: Generally, I mean, we could.
**Rcarmen**: Generally, it's, you know, we let the electrician decide that because they're the ones wiring everything up.
**Rcarmen**: So how it works best for them doing the wiring is why we let them determine.
**Kmass**: Gotcha.
**Rcarmen**: We can give them drawings from Power Amp from the manufacturer to kind of tell for the outside communication where they should go.
**Kmass**: Gotcha.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Kmass**: And then so same thing with fan and light combos.
**Kmass**: Or was that something you guys would mount and just plug in?
**Kmass**: Like.
**Rcarmen**: I was trying to think on that one earlier when I was looking at it.
**Rcarmen**: I mean, we.
**Rcarmen**: Yeah, I want to say that's electrician as well, because like I said, they've got the.
**Rcarmen**: They're the ones that have to wire it all up.
**Rcarmen**: And these are probably just plug ins, but based on the length of the cord and everything, they kind of determine where it is.
**Rcarmen**: And the customers Got a little bit of say in that as well as to how high up they want those.
**Kmass**: Good.
**Kmass**: Gotcha.
**Rcarmen**: There shouldn't be much time at all to get them installed.
**Kmass**: All right, so this will probably go to electrician as well.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Kmass**: So it's coming in the 23rd.
**Kmass**: Start demoing.
**Kmass**: I'll mess around with these dates a little bit, but durations look pretty good.
**Kmass**: You think 15 days to do the demo of the doors.
**Kmass**: Door openings.
**Rcarmen**: Yep.
**Kmass**: Doors.
**Kmass**: Will you agree to about 10 days to get all of them in?
**Rcarmen**: Yeah, yeah.
**Rcarmen**: And probably want to confirm that with the door guys, but I think that sounds right.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Rcarmen**: And that basically allows them, you know, what's that tenant?
**Rcarmen**: What is that, three a day?
**Rcarmen**: Yeah.
**Kmass**: Yep, yep.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Kmass**: Demo only tops 15 days for the dock levelers, overhead doors.
**Kmass**: 10 days.
**Kmass**: So did we say 15 days to take care of all the dock leveler stuff or just for pits?
**Rcarmen**: I think it was both, actually.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Rcarmen**: It'd be.
**Rcarmen**: Yeah.
**Kmass**: So 15 days for stuff here.
**Kmass**: Dock seals.
**Kmass**: I know that's right before.
**Rcarmen**: Yeah.
**Rcarmen**: And that'll probably come after we do the.
**Rcarmen**: The leveler install.
**Kmass**: Right?
**Rcarmen**: Yeah.
**Rcarmen**: These will be going on, you know, a clean wall.
**Rcarmen**: Are these tilt walls?
**Kmass**: Yes, I believe they are.
**Rcarmen**: So we should be able to do probably three a day on those.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Speaker 2**: 10 days.
**Kmass**: Yeah, 10 days there.
**Kmass**: This is the old electrician.
**Kmass**: All right, I think we got it.
**Rcarmen**: Okay.
**Rcarmen**: And on those seals, has it been confirmed if.
**Rcarmen**: If we're providing the seals or are those coming from Fairborn?
**Kmass**: So.
**Speaker 2**: Right now it is.
**Speaker 2**: It's in the hands of the.
**Speaker 2**: The owner.
**Speaker 2**: And we keep hearing that they're really picky, so they want everything to match.
**Speaker 2**: So we did send them pricing for Fairhorn and the one that you guys submitted, and we told them if you guys want to go with Fair one, this is how much it's going to cost.
**Speaker 2**: It's going to cost more.
**Speaker 2**: But they have not gotten back to us.
**Speaker 2**: I think we'll get an answer.
**Speaker 2**: And so on that note, I see Tony sent us an updated code.
**Speaker 2**: So if you can break out.
**Speaker 2**: He did tell me the number to do install.
**Speaker 2**: I think he said three.
**Speaker 2**: 46, 50 cents for each door.
**Speaker 2**: So for each back seal.
**Speaker 2**: And if you guys can add that to or separate that and send us that code for just install.
**Speaker 2**: And he also mentioned that you guys might have to charge for offloading the truck.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, if we are doing.
**Speaker 2**: If we are going with Fair one, if you can send us those two pricing just in case, if they go.
**Speaker 2**: So we are ready to.
**Speaker 2**: To go.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Rcarmen**: Yep.
**Rcarmen**: I work on that for you.
**Rcarmen**: And yeah, we need to write Fairborn.
**Rcarmen**: The way that we get our seals in, they all come palletized, so they're real simple just to use fork truck, just take them right off the truck.
**Rcarmen**: Fairborn sends everything individual and have to be hand pulled off and stacked.
**Rcarmen**: So it is.
**Rcarmen**: It's a lot more time consuming.
**Speaker 2**: Gotcha.
**Rcarmen**: Good.
**Kmass**: All right.
**Kmass**: I think I got everything I need.
**Kmass**: Kevin, how about you?
**Speaker 2**: I think I'm good here too.
**Rcarmen**: Okay, great.
**Rcarmen**: Great.
**Kmass**: All right.
**Speaker 2**: And if you guys.
**Speaker 2**: If you guys get any shipment updates, you can let us know so we can possibly update the chart.
**Rcarmen**: Yeah, you got it.
**Rcarmen**: Absolutely.
**Speaker 2**: Okay.
**Kmass**: And Tony, he's out this whole week, right?
**Rcarmen**: He's out this whole week, yeah.
**Rcarmen**: Like I said, I've been able to reach out to him through text and get some answers and some help from him.
**Rcarmen**: So if anything need be, I.
**Rcarmen**: I can certainly do that.
**Kmass**: Okay, sounds good.
**Kmass**: We'll.
**Kmass**: We'll bug you if you need you.
**Rcarmen**: All right, no worries.
**Kmass**: I think we got what we need for now and appreciate your time, sir.
**Rcarmen**: No worries.
**Rcarmen**: Thank you, guys.
**Rcarmen**: I appreciate it.
**Speaker 2**: Thank you, Ryan.
**Rcarmen**: You bet.
**Rcarmen**: Thanks.
