## Transcript
**Ataylor**: Doing.
**Ataylor**: I'm gonna try and get my headphones on here.
**Ataylor**: I can hear a little better.
**Bclymer**: Jp, can you hear us?
**Crusin**: I can't hear you.
**Crusin**: Hold on, hold on.
**Crusin**: Can you hear me?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, now we can.
**Crusin**: So are you at the site, aj?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, he is.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Can you hear me okay?
**Ataylor**: Right now?
**Crusin**: Yeah, you're good?
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: I was just connecting my headphones.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, I'm here.
**Ataylor**: Electricians are here, tracing, and we're going to get ready to demo some lights here that we're moving over to the little sleepies area.
**Ataylor**: I was going to ask you, jp, before we got started, I talked to your maintenance guy.
**Ataylor**: Our lists aren't showing up till later.
**Ataylor**: Is it okay he said, with your approval, if we use his lift he has here?
**Crusin**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Crusin**: Yeah.
**Crusin**: You talked to Bug?
**Ataylor**: I did talk to Bug.
**Ataylor**: He said that I would have to clear it with safety.
**Ataylor**: And I said, what if I clear it with jp?
**Bclymer**: He said, that's perfect.
**Crusin**: Yeah, we're good.
**Crusin**: Awesome.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Crusin**: All right.
**Crusin**: I know we only have a limited time, so I've got a little bit to cover.
**Crusin**: So I wanted to start with the project you're at now.
**Crusin**: Avon, Amazon, Indy2, whatever we're calling it, the set of few questions.
**Crusin**: So before I send this in for the P.O.
**Crusin**: i was going through and I get the original price, blah, blah, blah.
**Crusin**: Added the dock restraints and fan lights, then the electrical, and then.
**Crusin**: And you did add the detail at the bottom.
**Crusin**: The question I had was in.
**Ataylor**: I got it pulled up here, too.
**Crusin**: Jake Beans.
**Crusin**: Yeah.
**Crusin**: Some of the electrical.
**Crusin**: So there was a lot under electrical.
**Crusin**: There's demo.
**Crusin**: Existing three power drops.
**Crusin**: What.
**Crusin**: I'm not sure exactly what that refers to.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, I know it was in our original budget that we had sent you, and so I got with Jesse on those, and it was a little unclear.
**Ataylor**: It was entered more as a budget.
**Ataylor**: So I just know.
**Crusin**: Yeah.
**Crusin**: The existing power drops that were.
**Crusin**: There's more than three.
**Ataylor**: Right.
**Crusin**: And we're just reusing.
**Crusin**: So either you can.
**Crusin**: I mean, when I.
**Crusin**: So you can see there, there's.
**Crusin**: There's been workstations, you know, so there's a bunch of drops.
**Crusin**: There's probably, oh, you know, 50 drops.
**Ataylor**: Right.
**Crusin**: That are existing.
**Crusin**: They're to be reused as need, you know, as needed.
**Crusin**: Right.
**Crusin**: And if it's any.
**Crusin**: If none of them, you know, they're obviously hanging down.
**Crusin**: If you don't need to use any of them.
**Crusin**: The expectation was you just coiled them up at the joists.
**Crusin**: So there's really.
**Crusin**: I don't expect you to pull back, you know, drops Back to a panel.
**Crusin**: Unless you need to.
**Crusin**: Unless you need, you know, the room in the panel.
**Crusin**: So it's really.
**Crusin**: The three caught me off guard.
**Crusin**: It's really demo power drops as required.
**Crusin**: Reuse or reuse or demo.
**Crusin**: Right.
**Crusin**: It's way more than three, Right?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: If you, if you look at alternate number two.
**Ataylor**: So what I did, I just took our original.
**Ataylor**: Right.
**Ataylor**: And then.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, if you go to alternate number two, you can see the added electrical we have covered to date.
**Ataylor**: And if you go to number two includes workstation drops as follows.
**Ataylor**: We have existing drops to be repurposed and relocated.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Crusin**: Yeah, I just didn't.
**Crusin**: I just didn't.
**Crusin**: Yeah, so the.
**Crusin**: Yeah, I just didn't know if you guys had three drops you were specifically demoing and I didn't know about it.
**Crusin**: So.
**Crusin**: Okay.
**Crusin**: So that takes.
**Crusin**: That's.
**Crusin**: That's really sort of a non.
**Crusin**: You know, that's really no big deal.
**Crusin**: And then the other one in that same electrical, and this came from the original Too was line 7 includes five 12 volt receptacles at overhead door.
**Crusin**: I don't know what is that for?
**Jdawson**: Remember you had those mobile conveyors.
**Jdawson**: I think you got rid.
**Jdawson**: You didn't.
**Jdawson**: You're not going to use anymore.
**Jdawson**: We were going to add plugs like in between the doors.
**Crusin**: Yeah, okay.
**Crusin**: Yeah, that's no longer in scope.
**Crusin**: So that's fine.
**Crusin**: I know that's part of that.
**Crusin**: Yeah, I mean the 12 volt got me because I'm like.
**Crusin**: Because they were more than 12 volt, but whatever.
**Crusin**: So they're the.
**Crusin**: I think that's a typo.
**Crusin**: I think.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, probably 120 volt.
**Crusin**: Yeah, that's what I thought.
**Crusin**: So.
**Crusin**: But they're not.
**Crusin**: Yeah, they're no longer in scope.
**Crusin**: Okay.
**Crusin**: I'm not concerned.
**Crusin**: I just wanted to make sure we weren't doing anything I didn't know up there.
**Crusin**: So that takes care of that.
**Crusin**: So those basically first two items are really not part of the scope anymore.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Crusin**: And I saw you had.
**Crusin**: Moving down, you had the alternate one adding the dock restraints and fan like combos which is fine with power.
**Crusin**: There was an additional ad.
**Crusin**: So we had the, the you know, original 30 new.
**Crusin**: Then we added.
**Crusin**: Then we added these 21 and 20.
**Crusin**: And then we also added dock locks and fans.
**Crusin**: I.
**Crusin**: It's in.
**Crusin**: I, I sent a revised SOW probably over a week ago for doors 258 and 259 existing doors.
**Crusin**: So we actually need two more sets of dock locks and fans.
**Crusin**: You can add that in a.
**Crusin**: You know, in A change order or whatever.
**Crusin**: That's fine.
**Crusin**: You don't have to do all this.
**Crusin**: But I just wanted to make sure as we.
**Crusin**: Technically, we.
**Crusin**: We need the.
**Crusin**: We need 22 addition, 23 and 23.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: I.
**Jdawson**: I saw Candon had sent out notification to our sub to get those ordered, correct.
**Crusin**: Kevin.
**Jdawson**: You'Re on mute.
**Jdawson**: Kevin.
**Jpkennedy**: Yes, they are ordered.
**Crusin**: Yeah, I just wanted to make sure they were coming with, you know, you know, whatever.
**Crusin**: Yeah, obviously it's two more.
**Crusin**: It's only dock lights and fans and dock restraints, but, yeah, I wanted to make sure we had them on the order.
**Crusin**: Okay.
**Crusin**: So they've been ordered, and you can.
**Crusin**: You can, you know, whatever the cost is.
**Crusin**: Just give me a change order for that then.
**Crusin**: What was the other.
**Crusin**: We got the pit chargers, the EV chargers.
**Crusin**: They're all there.
**Crusin**: Baylights.
**Crusin**: Oh, yeah.
**Crusin**: In the alternate ad for the electrical, you have 18 high bait lights.
**Crusin**: Relocation.
**Crusin**: We also have to.
**Crusin**: We also have to relocate those end of the aisle exit signs as needed.
**Crusin**: I don't know how many there'll be.
**Crusin**: I don't know when that racking will be up over a little sleepy's, but, you know, you got probably 30 exit signs combined.
**Crusin**: So those need to be here on.
**Ataylor**: This north side of the building, right?
**Crusin**: Yeah.
**Crusin**: You can see them right there.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, yeah, I see them.
**Crusin**: Okay, so easy enough.
**Crusin**: So they need to be whatever the.
**Crusin**: The racking plan is there on the cad.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Crusin**: For little sleepies.
**Crusin**: So you take whatever you need for those rack aisles and then demo the rest.
**Ataylor**: Yep.
**Crusin**: Okay.
**Crusin**: All right.
**Crusin**: So we are.
**Ataylor**: We are relocating those to the little sleepy side, correct?
**Crusin**: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Crusin**: So the reload the exit sites and then looking at.
**Crusin**: And I know we had that sort of.
**Crusin**: You know, there's been several iterations of the scope, so I just wanted to.
**Crusin**: Where's my thing here?
**Crusin**: We also had.
**Crusin**: So the latest revision, which I assume will be a change order for, was the one where we're adding guardrail.
**Crusin**: We're adding, you know, electrical to the break room, the fencing.
**Crusin**: I'm assuming there'll be a change order for all, you know, another change order coming for all that.
**Crusin**: Correct.
**Crusin**: Based upon.
**Crusin**: So this is just the bulk scope.
**Crusin**: Right.
**Crusin**: Cost.
**Crusin**: The doors and workstations, essentially.
**Crusin**: Right, Correct.
**Jpkennedy**: Yes.
**Jpkennedy**: The.
**Jpkennedy**: The guard rails and also the epoxy flooring would be added later.
**Crusin**: Okay.
**Crusin**: Guardrail's epoxy floor.
**Crusin**: Yeah.
**Crusin**: Because there's.
**Jpkennedy**: And the fence.
**Jpkennedy**: Yep.
**Crusin**: And the fencing.
**Crusin**: And there's, you know, the electrical for the appliances in the.
**Crusin**: In the cage.
**Crusin**: Break room.
**Crusin**: Yeah.
**Crusin**: Okay.
**Crusin**: Yeah.
**Crusin**: So that's that's coming and that's fine.
**Crusin**: The one thing.
**Jdawson**: Command stations.
**Crusin**: Yeah, so that was two things.
**Crusin**: So there's.
**Crusin**: I'm looking here.
**Crusin**: I'm just trying to pull this sucker.
**Crusin**: That was version.
**Crusin**: Because I'm on like version six here.
**Crusin**: Here we go.
**Crusin**: So dock doors, we covered all that.
**Crusin**: Pit chargers were good.
**Crusin**: Workstations, blah, blah, blah.
**Crusin**: We got the little sleepy stuff.
**Crusin**: Yeah.
**Crusin**: So.
**Crusin**: And you got the.
**Crusin**: The McP relocation.
**Crusin**: The two things that were missing were the command centers.
**Crusin**: So there's two 20amp drops.
**Crusin**: So I'm assuming that'll be in the change order.
**Crusin**: Plus the command centers themselves, whatever the cost is to build them.
**Crusin**: Right.
**Crusin**: And then I still need.
**Crusin**: On the drawing that we're shown two metal detectors at the existing security entrance, we're basically doubling.
**Crusin**: As you move that fence, widen that area, we're adding two metal detectors.
**Crusin**: So power for those metal detectors, there's existing power there.
**Crusin**: I'm pretty sure we can just extend that and power those detectors.
**Crusin**: I don't think they're, you know, very heavy on draw.
**Crusin**: But once we.
**Crusin**: Once we move the fence and set those metal detectors in, we'll need power to that.
**Crusin**: So you can include that in the change as well.
**Ataylor**: I'm sorry, my WI fi went out.
**Ataylor**: I'm on the guest WI fi now.
**Bclymer**: What.
**Ataylor**: What did I miss?
**Ataylor**: What do I need to add here?
**Crusin**: Yeah, so there's two.
**Crusin**: Two additional metal detectors where you come in the employee entrance.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Crusin**: Right.
**Crusin**: That fencing is going to get widened out.
**Crusin**: That's part of the change order.
**Crusin**: Right.
**Crusin**: You guys are going to get going to widen that out and two more metal detectors are going to be put there.
**Crusin**: So power to those two metal detectors, need that done and added to the change order.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Crusin**: As well, as Jesse already mentioned, the command centers themselves, so.
**Crusin**: Yeah, and that's.
**Crusin**: That's pretty much it.
**Crusin**: I think we got all the scope covered.
**Crusin**: You can add a couple of those items to the pending change order with all the fencing and guardrails.
**Crusin**: And.
**Crusin**: And there was a.
**Crusin**: And Kevin, we went over the additional 120v charging stations over down on the south side there as well.
**Crusin**: So.
**Crusin**: Yeah, I just want to make sure we capture all that in a change order and, you know, get that pricing to us.
**Ataylor**: Then we also need the mezzanine pricing too, right?
**Crusin**: Yep.
**Jpkennedy**: The mezzanine, that's the viewing platform.
**Crusin**: Yeah.
**Crusin**: You're calling a mezzanine.
**Crusin**: We're just calling it a viewing platform.
**Crusin**: It's really.
**Crusin**: Yeah, yeah.
**Crusin**: Command centers, viewing platform, they're the same.
**Crusin**: Yeah, yeah.
**Crusin**: So the Intent there.
**Crusin**: Yeah, obviously the sketch is approved.
**Crusin**: Want to get what it costs per and then at least the cost on the build.
**Crusin**: Right.
**Crusin**: And then for now I wanted to get a little idea of what these costs are.
**Crusin**: Then there's, you know, pedal cost.
**Crusin**: They may trim down the four locations to two, I have a feeling.
**Crusin**: But yeah.
**Crusin**: So if I can get that, you know, general at least a budget cost on what it's going to take to build that platform, then obviously you have the electrical drops too.
**Crusin**: So that would be great on that one.
**Crusin**: And I think you can, you can.
**Jpkennedy**: Add the epoxy floor into that too.
**Bclymer**: Mm.
**Crusin**: No, wait, I thought you're throwing in it for free.
**Crusin**: No, for 30 something.
**Jdawson**: And are we.
**Jdawson**: Was there any question on the, the, the electric chargers for the trucks, like they're both going on the one side, Correct?
**Crusin**: I don't know if there was a question.
**Crusin**: I.
**Crusin**: Hold on.
**Jdawson**: Maybe it was cabba you to the electrician on their current drawing.
**Jdawson**: They put one on each side of the building.
**Jpkennedy**: I think that was a comment from jp they didn't understand if.
**Jpkennedy**: Because you mentioned they have, they have shown electric charges on outbound and inbound.
**Crusin**: Oh, that's the ev, the, the yard chargers, right?
**Crusin**: Yeah.
**Crusin**: Okay.
**Crusin**: So yeah, there's just two on the inbound.
**Crusin**: They had to tell you to your point, it went from like two on each side to then one and one.
**Crusin**: And then they said, no, we just want two on the inbound side.
**Crusin**: So yeah, there's still two chargers, but on the print had to be changed.
**Crusin**: The permit plan had to be changed just to show them both in the same location on the inbound side.
**Jpkennedy**: Okay.
**Crusin**: So yeah, and I don't have.
**Crusin**: I'm waiting for the date for when YMX is the vendor we're using.
**Crusin**: Once they give me a date for when those chargers will be arriving, we can, you know, schedule them.
**Crusin**: But for right now, I have no idea when they'll be there.
**Crusin**: So I'm assuming in the next two to three weeks or so.
**Crusin**: But it's just my assumption there.
**Crusin**: But yeah, there's quite a bit of space available on an inbound side.
**Crusin**: Right.
**Crusin**: Right behind where the receiving office.
**Crusin**: There's a receiving office inside there and there's, you know, obviously no dock doors are ever going to be used there.
**Crusin**: So there's quite a bit of space right there and that's.
**Crusin**: I believe they have the feeds coming from the little sleepy's gear that's a little, a little north of that on the west wall.
**Crusin**: So I think it's pretty convenient location.
**Crusin**: Too.
**Crusin**: It's not a long run, you know, considering they're 130amp 3 phase feeds that shows on there.
**Crusin**: JP.
**Jpkennedy**: Alex was on site yesterday and I think they came up with their own demo and installation sequence, but I told them that you guys might want it differently.
**Jpkennedy**: So if you guys do decide how you want us to do it.
**Crusin**: Yeah, send me what you guys would prefer to do.
**Crusin**: I'm there tomorrow.
**Crusin**: I'll walk with the site director and we'll, we'll, if I get it by, you know, sometime tomorrow, I'll go over that with him, see if he has any heartburn over it or if he has a preferred, you know, sequence.
**Crusin**: Like, we'll want to know.
**Crusin**: We'll want to know down to, you know, door numbers, like.
**Crusin**: Right, right.
**Jpkennedy**: Okay.
**Crusin**: Right, so.
**Crusin**: Or at least, hey, we're starting on the outbound side, you know, and going north.
**Crusin**: What, you know, whatever it is, right towards the rising wall.
**Crusin**: Whatever you guys want to, whatever it is, just send me as much detail on that.
**Crusin**: We'll, we'll confirm it or give you, you know, some feedback and then that way you can have your, your, you know, sequence and schedule all ready to go once stuff starts coming in.
**Jpkennedy**: Okay.
**Crusin**: Okay.
**Crusin**: I think that's pretty much it on the Amazon piece, so I'm pretty clear on that.
**Crusin**: So I guess I can, you know, based on the rest of the stuff going into change order, I'll submit this for the po.
**Crusin**: The rest of stuff will be taken care of.
**Crusin**: And then I wanted to go over real quickly the AMEX piece in Martinsville.
**Crusin**: I got that quote from AJ as well.
**Crusin**: So that's the There we go.
**Crusin**: MX globe.
**Crusin**: So on that one, I'm assuming.
**Crusin**: Well, first of all, I know aj, you sent me like a little blurb on what, what the fencings, you know, the cage is going to look like.
**Crusin**: But I really do need like a quick little sketch of what, you know, what it's going to, you know, a visual for them to give a thumbs up to.
**Crusin**: So as soon as we can get that.
**Crusin**: Yeah, as soon as we get that, you know, don't have to be, you know, super fancy, but I need something just at least like an elevation that shows, you know, what, what the, you know, what it's going to look like.
**Crusin**: Because it sounds like to me, you know, you have, you're still going up, you're going all the way up to the joist.
**Crusin**: Right, right.
**Crusin**: With fencing, but you're building a, you know, like a four foot wall first and then going all the way up to the joists, Is that correct with the cage?
**Ataylor**: No.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Ataylor**: So I gave you the ad.
**Ataylor**: So right now it's just, you know, low gauge 6 inch metal studs.
**Ataylor**: So essentially building a demising wall.
**Ataylor**: But instead of drywall, we're attaching that.
**Ataylor**: That chicken wire.
**Ataylor**: It's not chicken wire.
**Ataylor**: It's a lot more sturdier than chicken wire.
**Ataylor**: That welded wire roll.
**Ataylor**: And then I gave you the ad.
**Ataylor**: If you wanted to put that T111 and get it finished on that bottom four foot, it was an extra, you know, like I think nine grand in material.
**Ataylor**: So I didn't know if that was the look that you were going for.
**Ataylor**: And we can go ahead and adjust it accordingly.
**Crusin**: Yeah.
**Crusin**: What I don't know is what the look is.
**Crusin**: Right.
**Crusin**: I mean because having trouble visualizing what your.
**Crusin**: What your what we're doing.
**Crusin**: Right.
**Jpkennedy**: So we can send you a quick sketch.
**Crusin**: Yeah, just send me something I can look at because I'm gonna have to explain this to them.
**Crusin**: Yeah, send me a quick sketch.
**Crusin**: So that's the first thing of, you know what the down and because it looks like in here division is Division 13, the cage and all that.
**Crusin**: Is that the 138K?
**Crusin**: Is that what it's coming out to on the Amex stuff?
**Ataylor**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Crusin**: So the down and dirty version is 138.
**Crusin**: And then if we wanted to add that, whatever you said that covering, then it's another nine and material plus installation.
**Bclymer**: Correct.
**Crusin**: Okay.
**Crusin**: Because I, I have a feeling they're still even going to be shocked with 138.
**Crusin**: So show me what the 138 represents.
**Bclymer**: When are they not going to be shocked about a price?
**Crusin**: No, they're not.
**Crusin**: They're not.
**Crusin**: Never.
**Crusin**: I mean first of all, it's Virginia.
**Crusin**: They're used.
**Crusin**: They're used to doing everything with, you know.
**Crusin**: Yeah.
**Crusin**: So.
**Crusin**: But I just need to show.
**Crusin**: So that's.
**Crusin**: Okay.
**Crusin**: So 138 is.
**Crusin**: I get a sketch on that and then honestly if they, if they want to have somebody else build it, they can find somebody else to build it.
**Crusin**: I don't care.
**Crusin**: But then we have.
**Crusin**: The only other question I had the damn cage was because you got all the openings all hardware.
**Crusin**: Oh, was that an electrical Sue And I know you got the first install for the room for this new server room.
**Crusin**: All that.
**Crusin**: Oh, was the line items 13 and 14 under electrical.
**Crusin**: The.
**Crusin**: The relocation of the Amex UPS units and the Eaton Powerwall units.
**Crusin**: That's redundant.
**Crusin**: Just an FYI.
**Ataylor**: Are they the same thing?
**Crusin**: They're the same thing.
**Crusin**: I Just gave you.
**Ataylor**: Two different names.
**Crusin**: Eaton Powerwalls.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Crusin**: They're existing, right?
**Crusin**: Obviously to relocate them, the electrician is going to have to take a look and you know, I assume you got sort of some budget in there to do that, but it's not four, it's just two.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Crusin**: So yeah.
**Ataylor**: Any, anything else on this jp?
**Ataylor**: I just want to make sure we captured all the scope.
**Crusin**: Yeah, no, everything else is good.
**Ataylor**: And I went ahead and included for that new generator.
**Ataylor**: It's just way easier that way.
**Ataylor**: And the existing generator that's there is just huge compared to what you guys need.
**Crusin**: Yeah.
**Crusin**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: And then notice too I included for a contingency here.
**Crusin**: Yes, I did.
**Crusin**: 27K, man.
**Ataylor**: Oh, it's.
**Ataylor**: It's 5%.
**Crusin**: I know.
**Crusin**: Yeah, yeah.
**Crusin**: So yeah, I'm, I'll get this through them.
**Crusin**: Just give me a sketch.
**Crusin**: I like, I don't even know what they had in the budget for all this.
**Crusin**: I'm sure it's more than they wanted to spend, but I'll go through with them.
**Crusin**: What can I get?
**Crusin**: The other thing is, I'm just trying to make sure I can.
**Crusin**: So I understand the electrical, the whole server room deal.
**Crusin**: Can I get like a round number on what it's cost, you know, breakout number on that?
**Crusin**: So I can say, look, the fencing itself is 138, the server rooms 100k, whatever it is.
**Crusin**: Right, Just so.
**Crusin**: Because I'm gonna have, you know, then obviously the electrical and all that, but just it doesn't have to be in the quote but just, just send me a note saying hey, the, you know, all the fit up of that server room, the electrical and fire suppression and all that.
**Crusin**: Because that's a really nice to have and we should have.
**Crusin**: But if there's somewhere to cut, that might be some of the stuff they cut.
**Crusin**: So I'm just trying to anticipate their questions, that's all.
**Crusin**: So just give me a round number what that server room extension and fit out is.
**Crusin**: All right?
**Crusin**: And I will try and sell it.
**Crusin**: And then of course there'll be, there's really no, you know, set timing on this.
**Crusin**: Of course there'll be the whole demo cost for, you know, the freezer and now obviously the generator.
**Crusin**: You know, that kind of stuff will want to.
**Crusin**: They'll have to be a demoscope too that we can solidify.
**Crusin**: But obviously the most important thing is to get Timex up and running.
**Crusin**: And then I'm trying to confirm if we're actually moving Godiva as well from that, that building over to building one.
**Crusin**: Because if we do move Godiva as well, that will be additional scope related to.
**Crusin**: We'll have to build a demising wall and basically upgrade the H vac so that it stays at 65 degrees within that Demizu space, you know, demise space for Godiva.
**Crusin**: So there could be some more stuff coming.
**Crusin**: I just don't have it.
**Crusin**: We just have to focus on amex.
**Crusin**: That's most important right now.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Crusin**: All right.
**Crusin**: Yeah, give me that stuff.
**Crusin**: Yeah, the sketch, the breakout of the.
**Crusin**: The whatchamacallit, the breakout room.
**Crusin**: Server room.
**Crusin**: Yeah, that'll be great.
**Crusin**: And then you can keep your.
**Crusin**: Your four UPS units in your price.
**Jdawson**: Do you want that updated demo number as well?
**Crusin**: Yeah, you might as well give me that if you have it.
**Crusin**: And I'll.
**Crusin**: I'll.
**Crusin**: I'll go over that with them.
**Crusin**: But you know, because now, you know, there's.
**Crusin**: Like I said, I know about the freezer and that was a big part of it.
**Crusin**: And then now if we're not going to be reusing that generator, we'll have to not only demo that lean to that's there covering it, but also.
**Crusin**: Well, you know what?
**Crusin**: Let me.
**Crusin**: Yeah, don't want that done.
**Crusin**: We'll have to demo that generator too.
**Crusin**: So need a number on that or two to take that out and save it off.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Crusin**: All right.
**Crusin**: All right, that's it.
**Crusin**: I get jumped to other calls, but yeah.
**Crusin**: And then.
**Crusin**: Oh, the only other thing is aj right the third project, so over there at Brownsburg, so.
**Ataylor**: So yeah, jp, I.
**Ataylor**: I have the electrical pricing.
**Ataylor**: I know that's ones we got to move quick on that.
**Bclymer**: I'll.
**Ataylor**: I'll pull that together.
**Ataylor**: I'm waiting on the install price for that guardrail, but I know that's minor compared to the electrical, so let me pull that together and shoot that over to you today.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Crusin**: Yeah, because I want to get that approved so we can get them in there.
**Crusin**: Yeah, that's.
**Crusin**: That's like a couple weeks.
**Crusin**: You know, that's their preferences.
**Crusin**: Have it done by the end of the month.
**Crusin**: And I told them, well, you know, we'll do what we can, but again, it's not a lot, but we need to get it scheduled.
**Crusin**: Right.
**Crusin**: So get it approved and scheduled.
**Crusin**: So.
**Crusin**: Yeah, send me that as soon as you have it.
**Crusin**: Now get them to approve it.
**Crusin**: And yeah, the guardrail piece, it is what, you know, can't be that much.
**Crusin**: Right.
**Jpkennedy**: So just to confirm, jp, the guardrail is just this line here.
**Jpkennedy**: Not the ones out here.
**Jpkennedy**: It's just this line.
**Crusin**: Let me get back to the window.
**Crusin**: So we're back to Avon, right?
**Crusin**: Yeah.
**Jpkennedy**: No, this is.
**Crusin**: Or.
**Crusin**: Okay.
**Crusin**: Yeah.
**Crusin**: Sorry.
**Crusin**: Locust Charters.
**Crusin**: Sorry.
**Crusin**: Yes.
**Crusin**: Yeah, that's it.
**Jpkennedy**: Okay.
**Crusin**: That's the guardrail where the chargers back up to.
**Crusin**: And, you know, I.
**Crusin**: I think we were putting the outlets on the chargers.
**Crusin**: I know.
**Crusin**: I think that's what we did before that.
**Crusin**: I mean, the outlets on the guardrail, like, running.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, we'll.
**Ataylor**: We'll mount the outlets on the guardrail, and then your Locust guys come in and plug into those.
**Crusin**: Yeah.
**Crusin**: Yeah.
**Crusin**: So that's it.
**Crusin**: That's the only guardrail.
**Crusin**: I mean, you can.
**Crusin**: You can.
**Crusin**: You know, that's a day two, guys.
**Crusin**: You're done.
**Crusin**: You know, it's not that big a deal.
**Crusin**: Yep.
**Crusin**: All right.
**Crusin**: I gotta run.
**Crusin**: Thank you.
**Jpkennedy**: All right.
