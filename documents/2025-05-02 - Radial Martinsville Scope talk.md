## Transcript
**Jdawson**: Sa.
**Mparsons**: They tested they proof of the pad.
**Mparsons**: All right, Andrew, I'm off the call with Brandon.
**Mparsons**: Are we still waiting for Jesse?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I texted him.
**Jdawson**: I'll try calling him real quick.
**Mparsons**: All right, so what is.
**Mparsons**: What is the difference?
**Mparsons**: Family office, airport.
**Mparsons**: Nice.
**Mparsons**: Mike.
**Jdawson**: Jesse dropped his phone, so we're gonna have to do it through speakerphone, so.
**Jdawson**: Okay, get him here.
**Jdawson**: But Jesse, if you were able to see, I'm gonna just pull up the aerial view and the surrounding area so you can.
**Jdawson**: Mike can see it, but we're gonna use a really.
**Jdawson**: The main thing is this red outline here.
**Jdawson**: This cold storage facility is completely getting torn down.
**Jdawson**: It's connected to the main warehouse with this vestibule here.
**Jdawson**: So that vestibule will come out as well.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And then that.
**Jdawson**: That opening that is left will just get framed back to match the existing warehouse.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: We're not 100% sure how it all looks inside cold storage.
**Jdawson**: To my knowledge, any of the racking and whatnot in there will be taken out by others.
**Jdawson**: But I mean, I got sprinkler, Sprinkler guys lined up, electricians, H Vac guys, some demo crews that are all going to look and see what's kind of what all is in there and help put their pricing together for us once they know what it all looks like.
**Jdawson**: So, you know, sprinkler lines need to be cut and cap.
**Jdawson**: Plumbing needs cut and cap.
**Jdawson**: Any of that refrigerant that's in there needs to be taken out.
**Jdawson**: Then once they tear out the building and vestibule, they're just going to grade that.
**Jdawson**: It.
**Jdawson**: Grade that land.
**Jdawson**: But stone down and connect that into the existing parking lot here that you see there'll be sidewalls.
**Mparsons**: Got it, Got it.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Mike, are you able to hear Jesse?
**Mparsons**: No, I can't hear him at all.
**Mparsons**: No.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: So what he was saying is that the cold storage here, whatever the land used to be where they built that up.
**Jdawson**: So was it grass, was it parking lot, was there loading docks, whatever that that area was, we're going to put it back to its original condition.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: Plans had any demolition?
**Jdawson**: No.
**Jdawson**: The drawings I've looked at.
**Jdawson**: I'll look.
**Jdawson**: I can look again.
**Jdawson**: But yeah, so that all that all comes out and then whatever it used to be before, we'll put it back to its original shape.
**Jdawson**: And then there were some additional scope items that came through from JP or client.
**Jdawson**: Mike, I forwarded that over to you up.
**Jdawson**: So not only involves demo freezer at building two, but also move.
**Jdawson**: Moving a client from building two to Building one.
**Jdawson**: So in building one, the new building they're in, they're wanting to make modifications to the existing server room.
**Jdawson**: They want.
**Jdawson**: And then here's bullet points of everything they're wanting in there.
**Jdawson**: So mini split AC unit, two 20amp dedicated circuits, two 15amp dedicated circuits.
**Jdawson**: They want finish drywall and insulation in that room.
**Jdawson**: And then they're going to want a new fire suppression system there.
**Jdawson**: There's client move piece is shown in the attached drawing.
**Jdawson**: We would need to provide power to workstations.
**Jdawson**: So I believe it shows the workstations in the drawings.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So like here there's 32.
**Jdawson**: 32 workstations.
**Jdawson**: 6 laser printers.
**Jdawson**: Choose your two other printers.
**Jdawson**: 8, 8 total printers.
**Jdawson**: 11.
**Jdawson**: We'll need power for those.
**Jdawson**: And then these 32 workstations.
**Jdawson**: And it shows the printers here left and the printers on the right.
**Jdawson**: I'm not exactly sure how these buildings.
**Jdawson**: Which building is what.
**Jdawson**: Like which one's one or two.
**Jdawson**: Doesn't say in that drawing.
**Jdawson**: I have street view here.
**Jdawson**: I'm guessing it'd be this.
**Jdawson**: This would be building two.
**Jdawson**: They're moving over to building one is my.
**Jdawson**: I guess.
**Mparsons**: All right.
**Jdawson**: But JP will be there to show you what that area looks like.
**Jdawson**: And so you can take the attrition.
**Jdawson**: Any framers that can do the drywall and carpenters in there.
**Jdawson**: H Vac guy.
**Jdawson**: Not.
**Jdawson**: Not a ton of scope items really the gist of it.
**Jdawson**: So there's in the job folder, plenty of drawings.
**Jdawson**: Anything in red was.
**Jdawson**: Jesse had added notes into.
**Jdawson**: Can use those as a reference.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So you can look through all these, help you learn kind of how the job is and whatnot.
**Jdawson**: But other than that, it's really about all the information I have.
**Jdawson**: I do have actually one other thing.
**Jdawson**: There's a.
**Jdawson**: You go to the estimate folder for this job.
**Jdawson**: I have all the sub.
**Jdawson**: All the subs that are coming by with all their contact information and then that calendar.
**Jdawson**: Go ahead, Jesse.
**Mparsons**: Did we do that?
**Jdawson**: They have every.
**Jdawson**: They have everything other than the inside work.
**Jdawson**: The like added scope that we just.
**Jdawson**: That we were sent.
**Mparsons**: Seeing those is you get a way to print them out.
**Mparsons**: So when he's walking through.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Mparsons**: You also go and look at everything that's on those lists.
**Mparsons**: Make sure we take a look at it.
**Mparsons**: Nothing's crazy.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Let me make sure.
**Jdawson**: Trying to remember if I made those radial scope sheets.
**Jdawson**: Yes, it looks like.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jdawson**: I had this all made.
**Jdawson**: So these.
**Jdawson**: Mike, if you.
**Jdawson**: It's easier to kind of walk around with the subs and having these scope sheets for each Division, so they kind of know what's going on.
**Jdawson**: You can show them the areas and to make sure.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: That they.
**Jdawson**: They account for everything in their estimates and know what they're getting into.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: You know, if it's got 10 volts holding it up or five bolts holding it up, or you need a aerial boom lift to get to it, versus a step ladder, like, those are all the things we just want to have look through it.
**Mparsons**: How are they going to get rid of all this stuff?
**Mparsons**: What are we building back with under the paving?
**Mparsons**: All those things?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we're able to hear any of that, Mike.
**Mparsons**: This was a cell a little bit in and out.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: So.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, you're just making sure the subs.
**Jdawson**: No, what they're.
**Jdawson**: What they're looking at, what to look at, and what is needed to get the work done.
**Mparsons**: All right, so this.
**Jdawson**: Do you have access to a printer?
**Mparsons**: No.
**Mparsons**: I mean, no, but, you know, I could figure it out.
**Mparsons**: But I should get these scope sheets printed out.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I'm sure there's a Kinko's close by or something like that or some sort of print shop.
**Mparsons**: All right.
**Mparsons**: Yeah, I can get these scope sheets printed out.
**Jdawson**: Or you can.
**Jdawson**: Or you can even email them out to the subs.
**Jdawson**: So they have them beforehand.
**Jdawson**: Tell them to print them out and bring them.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Knowing subcontractors, half of them will probably forget to do that, so that's all I got.
**Mparsons**: You have your company card?
**Mparsons**: Does Mike have his company.
**Jdawson**: No, I got.
**Jdawson**: I got it right here.
**Jdawson**: And you send it to him.
