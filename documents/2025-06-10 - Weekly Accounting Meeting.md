## Transcript
**Accounting**: Why do you have it then?
**Bclymer**: I don't.
**Bclymer**: They made us download it.
**Bclymer**: I think we were just testing it out and.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: All right, what do we got?
**Bclymer**: The missing Fritzy and Jesse.
**Accounting**: Well, I mean, Jesse's, you know, he'll jump in if he can, but is Fritzi out today or what?
**Bclymer**: Think she's here.
**Bclymer**: There she is.
**Fnjie**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: Great.
**Accounting**: All right, let's dive in.
**Accounting**: So I'm tracking on those three jobs.
**Accounting**: Jose, can you.
**Accounting**: Can you send me what co costs got coded to those three jobs?
**Fnjie**: Oh, me, Right.
**Accounting**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: Oh, aren't you the one that responded?
**Accounting**: Or who.
**Accounting**: Who's doing that?
**Accounting**: Oh, I'm sorry.
**Accounting**: No, no.
**Accounting**: Can you.
**Accounting**: Fritzi, can you send me the.
**Accounting**: What costs are being allocated to those jobs?
**Bclymer**: You're on mute.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, the one that I sent.
**Accounting**: Right.
**Jdawson**: That is not sync yet in.
**Accounting**: It's.
**Accounting**: It's just.
**Accounting**: It's just 25, 108.
**Accounting**: Alex put hours to it.
**Jdawson**: Yes, yes.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, so far, that's the cost.
**Accounting**: All right, send me what?
**Accounting**: Okay, so.
**Accounting**: But do.
**Accounting**: We don't.
**Accounting**: So we don't have costs for 114 and 113 or we do.
**Jdawson**: We don't have yet.
**Accounting**: Okay, so then why were you saying you listed.
**Accounting**: You said.
**Accounting**: You said that Tremont and then the.
**Accounting**: And then 11 3, 14 are not acumatica.
**Accounting**: Just.
**Accounting**: Is there a reason we said that 11314 aren't there or what?
**Jdawson**: I was just checking the job in Job Planner.
**Jdawson**: I was comparing it in a formatica.
**Accounting**: Gotcha.
**Accounting**: Okay, great.
**Accounting**: So, yeah, so send me that.
**Accounting**: That timesheet that Alex has for the one code instant to 108.
**Accounting**: I want to see what that is.
**Accounting**: That doesn't make sense.
**Accounting**: I must have missed that.
**Accounting**: And then.
**Accounting**: So the jobs are created in Job Planner, they're just not synced over to Acumatica.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Accounting**: Do you guys know how to do that?
**Bclymer**: No, I don't.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Accounting**: All right, so what we're going to do is we're going to.
**Accounting**: We're going to.
**Accounting**: I will do a video after this call, and I will.
**Accounting**: I will tr.
**Accounting**: I will do 25, 113, and I will show you guys how to sync that.
**Accounting**: And then.
**Accounting**: So, Fritzi, either you or Joseph, you know, both of you need to do it, but you need to figure out, you know, I don't know who's got what capacity of like.
**Accounting**: Okay, you know.
**Accounting**: You know, Jose, it's going to.
**Accounting**: On you to make sure that as jobs get created in Job Planner, they get kicked over, so Maria is usually on the front end.
**Accounting**: A lot of times of seeing when jobs go from estimating to projects.
**Accounting**: And so when that happens and it gets created in Job Planner, then it's like, all right, hey, it's in Job Planner now.
**Accounting**: And then you'll see here.
**Accounting**: Now we have to push it over to Acumatica.
**Accounting**: And then that way it's in there.
**Accounting**: And so then it probably makes sense, I guess, with Jose, because then if Jose does it, because you can check on the back end to make sure that the project tasks and all that stuff is correct so the budgets will end up syncing correctly.
**Accounting**: Okay, so I'll do a video to show you guys how to do that.
**Accounting**: And, Fritzi, it's important for you to know how to do it as well.
**Accounting**: Okay, cool.
**Accounting**: What else?
**Bclymer**: Jesse had requested a credit card for Keva.
**Bclymer**: Not sure if that's something you do, Brandon, or that's something you want us to do.
**Accounting**: That's something I do.
**Accounting**: So, Maria, remind me.
**Accounting**: I want to show you how to do this so that you can go in and add people to the account.
**Accounting**: So I'll show you how to do it.
**Accounting**: So I'll get on call with you and show you how to do it.
**Accounting**: The biggest thing for you is I don't think there's a way.
**Accounting**: I'll have to look and see if I can.
**Accounting**: I don't think I can set you up as, like, your own independent user because you don't have a Social Security number.
**Justin**: I do have one, but we can use.
**Justin**: I do have one.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: In the United States.
**Bclymer**: United States, yeah.
**Accounting**: Okay, then maybe it'll work.
**Accounting**: We'll give it a shot.
**Justin**: Yeah, we'll try.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: Okay, so wait, so then that means I could technically get you a credit card?
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: Oh, you're.
**Justin**: Sorry, I'm switching a little bit.
**Jdawson**: I just lost it for a second.
**Accounting**: You're getting a credit card and you gotta code it.
**Accounting**: Yeah.
**Fnjie**: Great.
**Accounting**: Yep.
**Accounting**: That's awesome.
**Accounting**: That's.
**Accounting**: That's perfect.
**Accounting**: You're going to be the new Alido credit card.
**Accounting**: So all of our, like, subscriptions and all that stuff that's on mine to where I have 9,000 damn things to transact now.
**Accounting**: Doesn't have to be on me anymore.
**Accounting**: And so that's good.
**Accounting**: So then I can actually separate what I spend money on versus what the company spends money on.
**Accounting**: And then two, then we can hone in a little bit closer on, because I know we have a bunch of subscriptions and stuff that we don't use.
**Accounting**: And so I've had it on my list to start cutting Things off to try to lower that burden a little bit.
**Accounting**: And then, you know, we'll work with, you know, you and the accounting team, you know.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Accounting**: What gets coded to where and how we do that.
**Justin**: Okay, sounds good.
**Accounting**: So perfect.
**Justin**: Okay, cool.
**Accounting**: All right, so let's see here.
**Accounting**: If I go into our notion here.
**Accounting**: All right, so if I look at accounting.
**Accounting**: So you know, one thing we talked about was creating a accounting calendar so that of like when things are due.
**Accounting**: Where are we at on that?
**Justin**: So we just talked with Fritzi.
**Justin**: If you go to accounting and you scroll down, can you see what it says?
**Justin**: Monthly payments.
**Justin**: And then you can.
**Justin**: Can you see the calendar?
**Accounting**: Yeah, I see a calendar.
**Accounting**: I see rent is the only thing on here.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Justin**: So we were just start working on it with Fritzi.
**Justin**: We just had the call.
**Justin**: So I was just explaining her how to add everything, you know, day by day and then how to create the reminders.
**Justin**: So right now we just added the rent and then Fritzi just let me know, you know, if we want to what, what other things, you know, add in terms for the insurance, basements and everything, other things that you guys also need to use.
**Justin**: So if you see the calendar, you just go, you know, day by day and then see what is missing.
**Accounting**: So do you guys remember, you know, whatever A few weeks ago, a month ago, whatever it was, I went over how to use chat GPT to help you to.
**Accounting**: To learn programs.
**Accounting**: So, so for it's as you're like, I don't know how to use notion, I don't know how to do this calendar.
**Accounting**: If you understand your outcome, right?
**Accounting**: Like here's the outcome that I want.
**Accounting**: And if you just go to ChatGPT and say, hey, here's the outcome I want, right?
**Accounting**: I'm trying to use this program, I don't know how to do it.
**Accounting**: And then all you have to do, like I do this every day.
**Accounting**: Take a screenshot, upload it, here's where I'm at, tell me next steps and it will do it for you.
**Accounting**: That's a great way to.
**Accounting**: To problem solve on your own.
**Accounting**: So it doesn't take a meeting and three people and a big time suck.
**Accounting**: Right?
**Accounting**: If you can learn how to self learn like that and use.
**Accounting**: Use that, you know, as a.
**Accounting**: It just takes practice, you know that's going to be a huge shift for you, right?
**Accounting**: Because that's huge.
**Accounting**: Because right now, you know, I just sold some more work and we're going.
**Accounting**: We're going to get even more busy.
**Accounting**: And so I'm at the position like, okay, like, can these guys learn and become better and I just give them raises or do I have to hire more people?
**Accounting**: Right, Because I would much rather pay you guys more and not hire another person.
**Accounting**: But I have to know that you can grow and improve and grow with the company.
**Accounting**: Make sense?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Fnjie**: Yes.
**Accounting**: And so, yeah, you guys should, if you don't have ChatGPT accounts, like, they're free, go on, use your, you know, lido thingy and you can sign up.
**Accounting**: So, okay, so looks like we're working on the calendar.
**Accounting**: So the biggest thing is like, again, like, it's like, you know, when, when are things like, okay, so every, you know, whatever Thursday is our check run.
**Accounting**: Every, you know, this day is the day that we're, we're pulling.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Accounting**: This is the day that our credit card statement comes in.
**Accounting**: This is when all credit card, you know, coding is due from the previous month.
**Accounting**: Right.
**Accounting**: Like all, like, we should have all those kind of dates in there so that we know what should be going in.
**Accounting**: So people know the standard.
**Accounting**: Right?
**Accounting**: They know what they're going to be held to.
**Accounting**: Because even right now, I don't know when our credit card statement comes out.
**Accounting**: Like, I have no idea.
**Accounting**: You know, and so it's important to know that.
**Accounting**: And then again, we can put.
**Accounting**: Publish that.
**Accounting**: Everybody gets it.
**Accounting**: They know what's up.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Brandon, I have an invoice from AJ that is charged to Farza Data, and I don't see that in the project.
**Accounting**: So you have an invoice that is charged there, but you don't see it appearing or what.
**Jdawson**: What exactly you mean that project for.
**Accounting**: You don't see the project?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, 2424 105.
**Jdawson**: You don't see it where in Akomatica.
**Bclymer**: 4105.
**Accounting**: So let's take a gander here.
**Jdawson**: It's not also in.
**Jdawson**: I think it's in Pro Core.
**Jdawson**: It should be in Pro Cor, right?
**Accounting**: Yeah, I know it's in.
**Accounting**: I know it's in procore.
**Accounting**: But we've, we've built.
**Accounting**: I mean, we, we got paid by them for that job.
**Bclymer**: I don't see it on my whip either.
**Bclymer**: What is, what is the name of the job?
**Jdawson**: Forza Data.
**Bclymer**: Oh, Forza.
**Bclymer**: Forza.
**Bclymer**: I have it as 24 01A.
**Bclymer**: I think something happened and the number changed.
**Accounting**: Yeah, it's because it was issued and then they canceled the job.
**Accounting**: Yeah, 2401A, right there is the job.
**Accounting**: Yeah, I see it.
**Accounting**: Temporary project code for Forza.
**Accounting**: Yeah, so just throw it in that.
**Bclymer**: But we, we have that job as completed in 2024 on the WIP.
**Bclymer**: What's the invoice for?
**Accounting**: No, no, no.
**Accounting**: I.
**Accounting**: There's.
**Accounting**: There's multiple.
**Accounting**: There's multiple Forza jobs.
**Accounting**: Are you talking about.
**Accounting**: Are you sure you're not talking about the.
**Accounting**: The previous one?
**Bclymer**: No, I'm talking about 24.01A.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: We had it marked as completed on the WIP, so.
**Accounting**: Sure it was.
**Accounting**: What's the invoice for, Fritz?
**Jdawson**: Dispenser Engineering.
**Accounting**: Oh, it's a change.
**Accounting**: Yeah, they're okay.
**Accounting**: How much is it for?
**Bclymer**: How much?
**Jdawson**: 1132.
**Accounting**: AJ what's this $5,000 bill from Spencer for four is up.
**Jdawson**: It's 1000.
**Accounting**: 1001.
**Accounting**: I mean, 1000.
**Accounting**: 1000 to get through comments with the city.
**Accounting**: Added from.
**Accounting**: In from the city.
**Accounting**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: Remember when I called you and asked, hey, who?
**Accounting**: And I checked to see if we're covered on it.
**Accounting**: We're covered on it.
**Accounting**: So I told him just to get it done.
**Accounting**: And gotcha.
**Accounting**: And this should be the last thing, right?
**Accounting**: Okay, perfect.
**Accounting**: I mean, I'm gonna fight Mike on anything else after that.
**Accounting**: They sent me a bill.
**Accounting**: I sent it to him.
**Accounting**: I said, hey, you gonna pay?
**Accounting**: Yeah, I think we should be done.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Accounting**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: So just code that to the design.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So 240-10-0801A01E.
**Justin**: We should.
**Bclymer**: Brendan, do you think it.
**Bclymer**: We should create a prior year.
**Bclymer**: Prior year closed jobs?
**Bclymer**: I have a lot of clients who do that, like one prior year.
**Bclymer**: So prior year, closed jobs.
**Bclymer**: Because, for example, this job we have closed out on the Whip on the 2020, 2024 financials.
**Bclymer**: So you shouldn't have any cost.
**Bclymer**: Any cost.
**Bclymer**: Hitting it in 2025.
**Bclymer**: So if we have a prior year closed job and you get an invoice like this, a random invoice, you can just charge them there, and at the end of the year, you can decide, do I want to distribute this cost to my, you know, the current jobs that I have?
**Accounting**: Why does it matter that we've already quote, unquote, closed the job for tax purposes?
**Bclymer**: If they show it as.
**Bclymer**: As completed in the prior year, you shouldn't have any cost to it in the current year because on their side, they've already marked it as complete.
**Accounting**: So how does this hurt me tax wise?
**Bclymer**: I'm not a tax expert.
**Accounting**: I'm not sure in your opinion or if you don't think it does, you're just saying that we've closed the books and.
**Accounting**: And we don't want to hit anything because the books are closed.
**Accounting**: That's different.
**Accounting**: That's.
**Accounting**: That's you, this accounting brain talking.
**Accounting**: Me as business owner thinking, why does that matter?
**Bclymer**: Right?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So how it.
**Bclymer**: Why it matters is in 2025, we.
**Bclymer**: We will have this job that says, okay, we have.
**Bclymer**: We have $1000 in.
**Bclymer**: We have $1000 in, like, expenses, but that job is already done with.
**Bclymer**: So I don't know if you remember how AAD had us move a lot of things last year.
**Bclymer**: Okay, it was booked.
**Bclymer**: It was booked in 2024.
**Bclymer**: But did you.
**Accounting**: So let me.
**Accounting**: Let me tell you what I think I understand.
**Accounting**: You tell me this is correct.
**Accounting**: My understanding is if we do that, it's going to skew the books and make it to where our numbers aren't as accurate currently, because everything stacks.
**Accounting**: Is that.
**Accounting**: Yes.
**Accounting**: Okay, I understand what you're saying.
**Accounting**: So with that being said, like, I know that our books are going to be way more clean in 2025, so just take that.
**Accounting**: And do we have like, a general cost of work overhead or something like that?
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: I can give her a code to charge.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Accounting**: To where we code.
**Accounting**: That's that.
**Accounting**: I brought that job in anyway, so nobody's getting commission on it.
**Accounting**: So just hit overhead.
**Bclymer**: I'll send you a code for today.
**Jdawson**: Also, Brandon, you sent an invoice Anytime out house.
**Jdawson**: Are we going to pay it through check?
**Accounting**: I sent an invoice about what you.
**Jdawson**: Forwarded an invoice for in anytime outhouse.
**Accounting**: Anytime outhouse.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: I.
**Accounting**: I don't.
**Accounting**: I don't know.
**Accounting**: What's it for?
**Accounting**: Like, more than likely standard toilet.
**Accounting**: Okay, so what.
**Accounting**: What?
**Accounting**: That's a direct cost.
**Accounting**: So does it?
**Accounting**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Are we going to pay this?
**Accounting**: What?
**Accounting**: Does it reference a job?
**Accounting**: Has it been coded?
**Jdawson**: It's just site.
**Jdawson**: 700E 181st Street, Westfield.
**Accounting**: Okay, so.
**Accounting**: So that.
**Accounting**: Hold on one second.
**Fnjie**: So.
**Accounting**: So just like anything else, right?
**Accounting**: A lot of times things get emailed to me just because my company.
**Accounting**: Whatever.
**Accounting**: Things always get emailed to me.
**Accounting**: I'm just simply sending that to you because that is a direct cost that comes in, and now it needs to go through the proper channels.
**Accounting**: So you reading that address to me, blah, blah, blah.
**Accounting**: Westfield tells me that is the Westfield Collective job, which then needs to go and get coded right.
**Accounting**: By the project manager, Glenn, for processing.
**Accounting**: Okay, got me.
**Jdawson**: Sure.
**Bclymer**: Do you have a.
**Bclymer**: If I.
**Bclymer**: If I was to prepare a job list, will you be able to give us the addresses for each job?
**Bclymer**: I think that'll help.
**Bclymer**: Account in a lot for when invoices are received.
**Accounting**: Maria, can you Take care of that.
**Jdawson**: Yes, of course.
**Justin**: Let me know.
**Accounting**: They're all.
**Accounting**: They're all in Job Planner, so we can like.
**Accounting**: You should be able to go into like.
**Accounting**: Again, like once jobs are set up in Acumatica, you go into projects.
**Accounting**: I think it's got an option to where you can add a job site address, you know, for.
**Accounting**: For the project, if I'm not mistaken.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Accounting**: Somewhere in there.
**Accounting**: Yeah, addresses, it looks like.
**Accounting**: Yep, they got a.
**Accounting**: Yeah, project address.
**Accounting**: Yeah, it's got the.
**Accounting**: It's got addresses in here.
**Accounting**: Like if I go into projects right now in Acumatica and let's just look at Westfield, which is.
**Accounting**: Was it 24.
**Accounting**: What job numbers?
**Accounting**: Westfield.
**Bclymer**: 2411 5.
**Accounting**: Yeah, yeah, it's got addresses.
**Accounting**: 7:50 East 181st.
**Accounting**: Is that the right address?
**Accounting**: Is that what with that, with that, what that Bill said?
**Jdawson**: Fritzi, 780.
**Accounting**: Yeah, this is 750 East 181st.
**Accounting**: That's Westfield Collector.
**Accounting**: What was the address that you said?
**Jdawson**: 700E 181st Street.
**Accounting**: 700E.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: Okay, so it's just.
**Accounting**: Yeah, same thing, same job.
**Jdawson**: Where can we find the address?
**Bclymer**: Is.
**Jdawson**: Is it in the project?
**Accounting**: So if you come in here, I'll show you real quick.
**Accounting**: So you can, you can a.
**Accounting**: You can go into Job Planner and like look it up.
**Accounting**: So if you come into Job Planner.
**Accounting**: So like here's right here.
**Accounting**: So 24,115700.
**Accounting**: So all I do is I just click this drop down menu and that shows the.
**Accounting**: The address in Job Planner.
**Accounting**: Now if I want to do it in Acumatica, if I go into construction projects and then I look at my 24115 and then I click all the way to the right and I go to.
**Accounting**: Let's see here.
**Accounting**: Where's it?
**Accounting**: Oh, address is right there.
**Accounting**: 750 East 181st.
**Accounting**: Got it.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Accounting**: All right, so.
**Accounting**: All right, so complete.
**Accounting**: Complete.
**Accounting**: So what's.
**Accounting**: So I'm looking at the issues that we have.
**Accounting**: So we.
**Accounting**: We've only got a few issues, it looks like.
**Accounting**: And they're both solved.
**Accounting**: Yes.
**Accounting**: No.
**Accounting**: Maybe.
**Bclymer**: Accounting, tracking.
**Accounting**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yes, they both solved.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Accounting**: Are you guys.
**Accounting**: I'm as, you know, procore, we're getting some of those errors with syncing.
**Accounting**: Are you guys taking care of those as I'm forwarding to you?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I think we have two errors currently.
**Jdawson**: So the one that I sent to AJ it's not syncing because they released the written age together with the invoice.
**Jdawson**: So I think we need to have Two line items for that.
**Jdawson**: So I have already forwarded.
**Accounting**: As we get these issues again, let's put them in here.
**Accounting**: So we're tracking this so that we know what, what's open and what's not open, right?
**Jdawson**: Mm, yeah.
**Accounting**: Then that way you can track on next steps, what's holding you up, what needs to happen, all that stuff.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Accounting**: All right.
**Accounting**: What other questions or comments do you guys have?
**Accounting**: What do you need from me.
**Justin**: With.
**Jdawson**: Regards to the issue that we have in Job Planner in relation to the duplicate of vendors?
**Jdawson**: I get a response.
**Jdawson**: Job Planner, it says that we can avoid that by.
**Jdawson**: I remember the email, Fatima, that we can toggle the user type.
**Jdawson**: Like, what is that?
**Jdawson**: The permission permission.
**Jdawson**: So I just think, would it be possible that we will not give permission the project Manager to create the vendor in Job Planner?
**Bclymer**: Yes, that's what, that's what the point was, to just have.
**Bclymer**: Find a way to take, take that permission away from them.
**Bclymer**: So they have to come to Accounting if they need a vendor created.
**Accounting**: So Maria, you can go in there and update the permission templates, you know, and take that permission off.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Accounting**: And then one thing, one question that we talked about with that was like, okay, yes, they, they cannot create a vendor, but can they still add a user?
**Bclymer**: A user?
**Bclymer**: What do you mean?
**Bclymer**: Or add a.
**Accounting**: So like, so for instance, if somebody was going to add a Lido group to their own job later, they would, you know, go up to accounting and say, okay, hey, we're gonna, you know, add Alito Group as a company.
**Accounting**: Okay, great.
**Accounting**: And then they might say, like, then the, the PMs, like, oh, I need to add Maria as, you know, as an accountant.
**Accounting**: Oh, well, I gotta add Brandon as a project manager.
**Accounting**: I gotta add Jose as a superintendent.
**Accounting**: Like, do they have to go back to Accounting to add all those people?
**Accounting**: Or is there a way?
**Accounting**: Like in Procore?
**Accounting**: Like a procore, they can't add vendors, but they can go in and add users to vendors.
**Bclymer**: Okay, I'll look into that.
**Accounting**: Because that would be way too big of a bottleneck if you guys have to add every user.
**Justin**: Last tested, Fatima, let you know, once, I mean, change the template from project managers on Job Planner, that they cannot create a vendor.
**Justin**: And then let's test it out if they can create a member.
**Accounting**: Okay, well, I would ask the question to job pointer first because.
**Accounting**: Okay, last thing.
**Accounting**: If you go and change all these permissions and people can't fucking do anything, it's going to cause an issue.
**Justin**: So you have the contact from your planet, right, Fatima?
**Justin**: Or you Want me to do?
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Justin**: Can you CC me on it, please?
**Accounting**: Perfect.
**Justin**: Can you CC me on it just to make sure?
**Accounting**: Okay, cool.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Accounting**: What else we got.
**Bclymer**: On my end, I might have a few questions for you as I'm working on the wipe, you know, the whip through April.
**Bclymer**: But when I get to that, I'll.
**Bclymer**: I'll send you a message on teams.
**Accounting**: Okay, perfect.
**Accounting**: Jose, got anything?
**Fnjie**: No, not on my end.
**Fnjie**: Brandon.
**Accounting**: Yeah, Fritz?
**Jdawson**: I have payroll allocation.
**Jdawson**: I already sent that one to Jesse.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I think it's a budget related notification that you are getting.
**Jdawson**: Are we.
**Jdawson**: I was asking if are we good to post that one.
**Jdawson**: Which one it's for?
**Jdawson**: We have unique law and applied engineering.
**Accounting**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: What do you mean?
**Accounting**: Like you're asking if you could post cost to it?
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Accounting**: Yeah, they should be synced.
**Accounting**: Are they not synced?
**Jdawson**: Actually, we have not posted yet because we are getting that notification.
**Jdawson**: I believe there was no budget for that particular Costco.
**Jdawson**: That's why we're getting that.
**Accounting**: Just because there's not a.
**Accounting**: I mean, just because there's not a budget line item, you should still be able to post it.
**Accounting**: It just automatically adds that line item to the budget in job planner.
**Accounting**: It's not letting you post it.
**Jdawson**: We can still post it.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, we can post it, but we decided a few weeks ago that because we were getting so many errors, people saying this is hitting my budget.
**Bclymer**: I don't have a budget for it.
**Bclymer**: We decided whenever we get that error message in acumatica, send it back to the project manager and say, hey, this is not on your budget.
**Bclymer**: Do you still want us to proceed and post it?
**Bclymer**: Because it will create it in job Planner.
**Accounting**: Gotcha.
**Accounting**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Accounting**: All right, cool.
**Accounting**: Anything else?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that's.
**Justin**: I need.
**Justin**: I need your 2022 tax returns, Brandon, to send to Daniel.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Accounting**: Yeah, I gotta.
**Justin**: I send everything.
**Justin**: Just missing that.
**Justin**: But that's another thing.
**Justin**: And then my personal company.
**Justin**: Your personal.
**Justin**: And then Fritz, if you need anything for notion.
**Justin**: So I just show you how to create the reminders on the calendar.
**Justin**: I know sometimes can be hectic.
**Justin**: It's fine, just let me know.
**Justin**: But just go ahead and play with it.
**Justin**: Set the reminders for you, for Jose.
**Justin**: You can tag them.
**Justin**: Everybody is a notion.
**Justin**: Like you can find everybody there.
**Justin**: So just tag them.
**Justin**: And then if you need for example, Jose or Fatima, they're there as well.
**Justin**: Just add them to the calendar and play with it.
**Justin**: Okay?
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Sure.
**Jdawson**: Thank you.
**Accounting**: Of course.
**Accounting**: Well, Fritz, send me that timesheet for Alex that you need me to look at and change for the one that he's coding to Tremont.
**Jdawson**: I sent a snapshot in the teams.
**Accounting**: All right, cool.
**Accounting**: Thank you.
**Accounting**: See you.
