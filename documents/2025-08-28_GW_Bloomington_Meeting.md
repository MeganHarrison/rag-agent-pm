## Transcript

**Nick Jepson:**
You're at the airport? 

**Jesse Remillard:**
No, I'm at the Goodwill. 

**Nick Jepson:**
Okay. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Y' all want to start with situation with the trench drain? 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Yeah, we can start wherever you want, Jack. We just. Let's run through that email list. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Okay. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
And make sure that we got everything covered. 

**Jack Curtin:**
My screen. So actual Word document. So. All right. So completed. Completed. Everything from up here is all completed. So overhead door install that's not scheduled quite yet. An exact date. We were waiting on price and United has given that they are to mobilize tomorrow. But then all we have right now is to complete scope of work to take a week to a week and a half. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Oh, sorry. 

**Jack Curtin:**
All right. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Whatever I pulled this morning, just heard. 

**Jack Curtin:**
United's concrete sub to then schedule mobilize so soon we should have overhead door installation. Ideally it would be great if I could get it on the 5th, that Friday right before they need to start using that area so that I could on Friday. On Friday take the. Take the board off. So sometime next week is when I'm looking to get garage door here to set the dock leveler in place and set the overhead door all together at once. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
And Nick or Jack? What you asked earlier. 

**Jack Curtin:**
And Nick might. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Know this answer about that door having an impact on the tco. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Oh, yes, the donation entry door. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Weren't you asking about the overhead door too? 

**Jack Curtin:**
No, no, I was just talking about the door. The power sliding doors at the donation entry. The doors. The overhead rolling door at the dock door shouldn't have any impact on the tco. Given we're not going to include that in the tco. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
I would guess that front, that exterior door at the canopy is going to have an impact on tco. Do you know that answer, Nick? 

**Nick Jepson:**
Is it not working? 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Yeah, it's not. It's not energized yet. Jack, you have the answer on that? 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yeah, they're door equipment. The subcontractor for diamond glass is coming out tomorrow to power power up both doors. 

**Nick Jepson:**
Okay, so we should be fine then. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Well, around the exterior of the door there's. On the left side, there's about almost a 3 inch gap that I'm going to cover up with some flashing. And then at the top and on the right side, the framing up against the block needs to be caulked with. Given how large the gap is on the left side. Do you think it's going to affect a TCO at all for some reason to have a gap that large next to the door? Like if. I don't know if they were good, if they were to try to say that it's not safe. Maybe. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
I don't think it's going to have an impact. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Okay. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
The door functioning, I think will, though. 

**Nick Jepson:**
Yeah. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yes. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
And then like we were talking about, we got to make sure that caulk and flash gets installed around the door so the masons can wash that block around it. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Totally, totally. Yeah. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
So that's one thing to keep an eye on the timing of. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yeah, let's flashing and caulking around the donation entry. David at Diamond Glass have guaranteed that they will complete this by no later than September 5th. 5th. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
And does that tie with the mason schedule? 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yeah, Mason will still be out here all next week. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Okay. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yeah. So then I'll just have the mason wash it that following Monday, which is the eighth. But another side note on that topic is, Nick, the plans called for asphalt underneath the canopy. We made the change on the fly to concrete to accommodate the foundation situation. But we never stated if we wanted the concrete sealed or not. 

**Nick Jepson:**
I would say no, since we didn't have anything for that. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Okay. 

**Nick Jepson:**
We weren't planning on doing that. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Do we see any issues by September 8th washing off that block that I don't know, staining the slab at all? Do we see any issues? 

**Jesse Remillard:**
No, that it shouldn't matter because I talked to the mason and the cleaner he plans to use does. He said does not stain anything. There's two different cleaning options they have for a solvent and one stains, one doesn't. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Oh, okay. Perfect. All right. So yeah, definitely the one that doesn't stain. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
I would definitely double check when they go to do it though. 

**Jack Curtin:**
All right. Definitely. All right. So yes. Kind of jumping around here. All right. Back overhead door install sometime next week. Once the concrete guy mobilizes on site tomorrow, we'll be able to then coordinate a little bit even more intense on exactly. Like how he gets into Friday, you know, by Friday at 2. We should kind of. Kind of be able to he get a feel of exactly, you know, when I can get the leveler in and when I. When they come out here to set the leveler. I'll have garage door company plan to do both set the leveler and install the overhead door. So it's all in one trip, saw, cut, remove. That's all completed, Completed. Completed. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Sorry. We got to get that. The one I emailed you about all the bollards. 

**Jack Curtin:**
What's that? 

**Jesse Remillard:**
We got to get that updated. What you're looking at with the bollards. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yeah, I have. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
We gotta core the ones by the canopy. We gotta put the flush or the surface mount ones in and then we got those other ones at the loaded dock. And then we. I don't think there was a line on there for installing the inlet protection. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yeah. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
And then we need delivery and install dates for the trench drain at the dock. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yeah. What do we want to do about. Nick? What. What type of design? Do you have a spec sheet yet on what kind of drain we. We're gonna use or. 

**Nick Jepson:**
No, I've been working on. Working on getting numbers together for the pricing that United Excavating. God, I've been working on that today. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
I can't imagine there's much of a lead time on a trend strain. So paperwork wise from your perspective, Nick, that you could definitely have priorities over it and we can still get this handled in time to get it on time. 

**Nick Jepson:**
Yeah. 

**Jack Curtin:**
What's. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Yeah, I mean, I would shoot for close the business tomorrow to decide on a spec. 

**Nick Jepson:**
Okay. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Because then I. I can look at it after you pick it because I. I'm three hours behind you. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Okay. 

**Nick Jepson:**
Yeah. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
So I'll just go through the details and make sure that we can get it to fit. 

**Nick Jepson:**
Yep. Yeah, we'll. We'll do that. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Yeah. That's a mess back there, that opening for the drain cover. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Oh, yeah. Big town. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
So, yeah, I was talking to Jack on site that the most important thing is just being out, talking to everybody, making sure that we're hitting these dates we need to. On this schedule we're looking at. 

**Nick Jepson:**
Yeah. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Because if something doesn't happen when it needs to happen, it's going to have a domino effect. 

**Nick Jepson:**
Yeah. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
And then. Art, what's our demo day? 

**Jack Curtin:**
Say that again. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
What is our demo day? 

**Jack Curtin:**
That we have one yet. Nick, do we. 

**Nick Jepson:**
I know there's. We need to order the. The valves for the utility vault, and now those are a couple weeks out. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Is that going to. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Oh, yeah, we select. 

**Nick Jepson:**
Yeah. I mean, we. We have. We haven't ordered the awnings yet either. And those are like five, six weeks out once we order them. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Yeah. But I'm guessing there's going to be a bunch of downtime, so nobody's going to be in Bloomington. 

**Nick Jepson:**
Yeah. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Yeah. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Are both of those line items the city vault and the awnings, those are going to affect getting our C.O. right? 

**Nick Jepson:**
Yeah. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yeah. Can they open up for sale and have a operational building on a tco? 

**Nick Jepson:**
They should be able to. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Yeah, that shouldn't be a problem. 

**Nick Jepson:**
Yeah. But before they get like the final CEO, they want to see all that stuff. The vault in the awnings. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Okay. Just adding awning delivery and mobilization starting for volt work, so we can get answers on those two as well. All right, do we have the valves. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
And everything we need for that, Nick? 

**Nick Jepson:**
The valves? No, I have a submittal. I just need to review it and then they can order it. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Okay. Is that on your radar to get through that? 

**Nick Jepson:**
Yeah, yeah, that's one of the things. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Yeah. Put Jack on the mobilization to start the vault. Just put a note about the pending submittal. Pending submittal review. And then, Nick. So, you know, Rick came out here and we met with him and got all his pay app stuff squared away. So he showed us what he thinks his balance is going to be, and he's typing it all up and sending it to you. Okay. So I'm not sure how you want to see it, so you may want to email him in the meantime, but he's planning to send a pay app, a Revised Pay App 3, and then a Pay App 4 for retainage. Okay, so can we process two pay apps in one month? 

**Nick Jepson:**
Yeah, we can. Yeah. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Okay. I just didn't know how that needed to look from our end. 

**Nick Jepson:**
Yeah. What we're trying to do is go over what United Excavating wants to get paid versus how much has left. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Jack, if you're at the desk, it's sitting there on top of the plans. But I think it said his final bill on Pay Act 3 was going to be 54K. 

**Nick Jepson:**
Yeah. Which lots of that he hasn't done. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
What's that? 

**Nick Jepson:**
Lots of that that he was billing this month. He. He hasn't done. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Yeah, he. And he went through and explained everything that he has and has it done. So you just need to confirm it against the pay. His last pay up and actual. And then one thing we want to keep in mind is he's going to have a hit. I think it's like three or four grand for fixing that conduit that he hit coming from. 

**Nick Jepson:**
Oh, yeah, yeah, I forgot about that. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Okay. And then we also. If there's going to be any more shit we're going to hit him with, we're going to have to address that as well. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yeah. Nick, if you want to review that with me again, regarding how much, like for the doctor, how much he's trying to bill us for there, because if they're really the only thing he could bill us for because we already paid him on a change order for the demo, so all he really did back there was demo, and that was the $9,500 change order. And then whatever we paying him for the rebar. But other than that, he hasn't. I don't, I don't. I haven't seen how much of a percentage he's trying to pay, but that's something that I, I'll. That I'll work out with you. He did demo some more of the pavement at the Canopy before United came in. He did take out another chunk of that, but if he's trying to pay like over 50% at the dock door, that's where I would come in and say, no, that's, that's not the case. If he thinks that because he's. He's. He did all that demo over there, that, that signifies him being able to build 50%. That's not the case because that's why we had a whole 9, 500 change. 

**Nick Jepson:**
Okay. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Yeah, let's just. Let's the three of us go through that one when we get that information. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yeah, for sure. Nick, do you. On that EFIS pad underneath the windows that we had to add, do we want that dignity blue or do we want that gray? 

**Nick Jepson:**
I need to do a markup and send it to Goodwill and see what they want. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Okay, let me ask you this. If so, the, the real kicker that I would hate for us to miss our. Or us fail our TCO is, is for this city of Bloomington planning department. I've never worked with a planning department on a TCO before, but they're basically asking only for three things, and that's the installation of required public and internal sidewalk improvements, installation of parking areas, surface and stripe, including installation of upright ADA signage. ADA signage is at handicap signage? 

**Nick Jepson:**
Yeah. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Okay, so I look back in the drawings to see if there's anything designated an exact handicap spot on the. In this new parking lot. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Okay. 

**Jack Curtin:**
The third one is safe ingress and egress. All construction material, equipment, debris are removed. The only thing I'm concerned about is all the masonry's things over in the back, north west corner of the building over by the ADA ramp. They have their lay down area over there. Could y' all speak to experience? Jesse, could you speak to experience? Like what you think as far as that being like an unsafe area if we want to like fence around like their scaffolding so they don't try to say like, employees may get up underneath there. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
What. What area again? 

**Jack Curtin:**
The mason's lay down area over by that handicap ramp. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Oh, in the back? 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yeah. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
No, I think. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Sorry, go ahead. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
I think that's gonna be fine. 

**Jack Curtin:**
You think so? 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Yeah, I mean, we'll take a look at it after this meeting, but they're tucked in that back corner pretty nicely. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yeah. I'm just worried about if Joy and Jennifer and the planning to cut for department when they come out and walk, are they going to try to build a scenario in their head like, oh, what if an employee comes walking out the back of this ramp and wants to go out in the back alley for, I don't know, for a smoke and then, you know, they get up underneath the scaffolding because it's not blocked off or, you know, I'm thinking that they may want us to put a fence around their little scaffolding area because they may try. Because in their thing about a safe ingress and egress, I guess that back area being an egress location, all construction material, equipment and debris has to be removed and all that stuff is still back there. Trying to think of a way to how to like, make it safe. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Do they need that door? 

**Jack Curtin:**
It'd be a question for Andrew on why that door is there if it's just for like unloading, loading purposes, like rolling things in and out of the building or. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Yeah, that's. I would check that because. 

**Jack Curtin:**
I'm talking about what. Pull up the drawing. So I'll give you exact. It's the one that. Where we reached back out to Robert and said, hey, actually, can you. It's. 

**Nick Jepson:**
The one at the ADA ramp, you're saying? 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yes, the one at the ADA ramp. E08 to be exact. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
I would think it's fine to ask him to close that door until the masons are done because there's really. You can't really. I mean, I think that's more. More or less an ADA access. Yeah, isn't it? Because that's. That corner on that ramp is too tight to turn with it. One of those Goodwill bins. 

**Nick Jepson:**
Yeah, it shows it on the. On the life safety plan. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Clear exit path. So they're going to want that open then. 

**Nick Jepson:**
Yeah. 

**Jack Curtin:**
And I know that the fire marshal is going to expect some sort of striping around that area so that goodwill doesn't stack any bins around that door. I gotta get. That's something that. When we had like a courtesy walk with the fire marshal, he did bring that up. Striping. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
How much time are we looking at? 

**Jack Curtin:**
A week or what for that back area? 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Because the masons are only going to be here through next week. Right. 

**Jack Curtin:**
That's what he said. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
What? 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yeah, that's what. That's what he said. That's what Chris said was another week. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Yeah. So it's only four. It's only going to be Four days. Yeah. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Maybe I can make, like, a side note saying that the. There'd be some sort of conversation that Employees. Yeah, I don't. I don't know. I mean, I feel like they. They could be really big sticklers about it or they could work. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Who's they? 

**Jack Curtin:**
The city of Planning department. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Yeah, with the. 

**Jack Curtin:**
With the Masons material being out. Out there. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Let's talk to him after this call. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Okay. Should I get some pictures ready, too? 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Wouldn't hurt. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yeah. So that I could speak on, like, so that. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Just. Just so you guys know, I can barely hear anything. There's somebody right outside this door with an impact. Oh, geez. Yeah, I can't go anywhere for quiet here. 

**Jack Curtin:**
No, I know. Trust me. I'm. At most meetings I go out to. I'm in the car right now. It's the only area of quietness. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Yeah. I'm sitting here with my phone plugged in. It died. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yeah, it's. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
My laptop's not far behind it. 

**Jack Curtin:**
I miss having a project with a Conex. Too small to have one of those. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Are we comfortable with that? The activities and everything we need to do moving forward to button this up strong and then next. So, you know, I talked to Jack. We're going to work on an email to send everyone to stay off that asphalt. 

**Nick Jepson:**
Yes. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
So they told me Sunday would be ideal to not have anybody drive on it. So if we can get away with holding our schedule and not having anybody on that tomorrow, that's going to be a great cure because Monday's a holiday. 

**Nick Jepson:**
Right. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
And then everybody just needs to know they have to be. Their vehicle has to be moving to turn tires on that for. Till we're out of here. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
We definitely want to avoid lifts being on that, because the way they turn those tires, they're going to chew it all up. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Amen. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Okay. We all good? 

**Nick Jepson:**
Yeah, I am. All right. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Thank you. What's that? 

**Nick Jepson:**
All right. Just said I'll catch up with you. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
When you get back in. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Okay. 

**Nick Jepson:**
All right. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
See you guys.
