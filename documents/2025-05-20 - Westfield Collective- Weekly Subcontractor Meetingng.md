## Transcript
**Ctragesser**: Should I do a status for Dean on when you discuss with him?
**Ctragesser**: We'll come out here and start there.
**Ijkaase**: He's on right now.
**Ctragesser**: Was it just when we get the permit?
**Kpeters**: Yeah.
**Ijkaase**: What do you say, Brennan B.
**Ijkaase**: How's it going?
**Kpeters**: Good, how are you?
**Ijkaase**: Oh, sitting out here watching it be 70 and sunny.
**Kpeters**: Probably soupy mess, isn't it?
**Ijkaase**: Yeah.
**Kpeters**: How did the past week or so ago they get cut down to grade.
**Ijkaase**: Pads cut to grade, sanitary's all in.
**Ijkaase**: Storms all in.
**Ijkaase**: They've got to do some finish grading out here on the parking lot.
**Ijkaase**: Their dozer decided to blow its turbo last early last week, so they just got it fixed yesterday.
**Ijkaase**: And of course today we get, you know, liquid sunshine out here.
**Kpeters**: No.
**Ijkaase**: So I'm hoping United can get back in here and get everything kept to grade.
**Ijkaase**: That way you guys can start your underground for your light poles.
**Ijkaase**: Get those ran.
**Kpeters**: Okay.
**Ijkaase**: You know, you guys are going to have an issue.
**Ijkaase**: Your power when you.
**Ijkaase**: When you bring your primary in, it's coming from the west side or south side of the road.
**Ijkaase**: Right.
**Kpeters**: From the south side of the road.
**Kpeters**: Now, the easement, I guess there's a medium voltage line along the side of the road.
**Kpeters**: So we're just coming to the easement like whatever it is 20ft off the road or something like that.
**Ijkaase**: On this side.
**Ijkaase**: On the north side.
**Ijkaase**: I thought all the powers on the south side of the road, because I know the power right now feeding this panel out here comes from the south.
**Ijkaase**: The transformers over there.
**Kpeters**: Step.
**Kpeters**: Let me go next door and step into Woody's office.
**Kpeters**: He met the guy out there, not me.
**Ijkaase**: Oh, okay.
**Kpeters**: Well, never mind.
**Kpeters**: He just left.
**Kpeters**: All been confirmed, but that's why I remember him saying that it ran on the north side.
**Ijkaase**: Of 181st.
**Ijkaase**: Yeah, that would be awesome if it does.
**Ijkaase**: I was just wondering because we've got a main gas line that runs literally right on the edge of 181st on the north side.
**Ijkaase**: And it's Center Point Energy's gas line.
**Ijkaase**: And they do not play well with others.
**Kpeters**: Okay.
**Ijkaase**: 71, do you have any idea when they're going to start that.
**Kpeters**: For the primary?
**Ijkaase**: Yeah.
**Kpeters**: I mean, really is.
**Kpeters**: I think as soon as you tell me that they're all good with the dirt, we can come in.
**Kpeters**: Okay.
**Ijkaase**: I'm going to push the dirt guys to hopefully get this dirt done by end of next week.
**Ijkaase**: So I would say the week of Memorial Day week, you guys could be out here.
**Kpeters**: There's an existing easement on the north side.
**Kpeters**: I see right where the gas line goes.
**Ctragesser**: Chad, if you want to pull up the meeting and we've got the agenda in there.
**Ctragesser**: Alrighty, so go through.
**Ctragesser**: Start with the water main tab edit, go to the next note, whatever we discuss.
**Ctragesser**: Okay.
**Ijkaase**: Thanks.
**Ctragesser**: Chance.
**Ctragesser**: Yes.
**Ijkaase**: Nice to meet you.
**Kpeters**: Can you just watch over the shoulder.
**Ijkaase**: Make sure I don't miss.
**Kpeters**: What's that for the nodes?
**Ijkaase**: Yeah, let me make sure I don't see.
**Ijkaase**: There's fireflies in this too.
**Ctragesser**: So.
**Ijkaase**: Okay, you guys go back and we'll catch everything.
**Ijkaase**: This should be in this meeting.
**Ijkaase**: All right, so we got Brennan here.
**Ijkaase**: We've got chance with Howard Co.
**Ijkaase**: And the job trailer.
**Ijkaase**: And we've also got Kagan Peters with Merit in the job trailer.
**Ijkaase**: We're missing our dirt guy today.
**Ijkaase**: Let's go over this really quick so everybody can go back and enjoy the wonderful day we've got going weather wise.
**Ijkaase**: Right now we're working on the water main.
**Ijkaase**: We've got United starting as soon as this rain stops.
**Ijkaase**: Starting at the building and getting the water line off of the property.
**Ijkaase**: We still have to do a encroachment permit.
**Ijkaase**: It's been filed with Center Point Energy Group.
**Ijkaase**: We're just still waiting to hear back from them so we can bore underneath their gas line to tap into the water on the other side of 181st street electrical service.
**Ijkaase**: Once the pad is cut to grade, you guys can come in.
**Ijkaase**: So we're shooting right now for the week and Memorial Day weather dependent, of course, sanitary is installed.
**Ijkaase**: It's closed out.
**Ijkaase**: They set the grease interceptor yesterday.
**Ijkaase**: United's working on cutting the parking lot in so we can do a proof roll.
**Ijkaase**: Ag peers are beginning this Thursday.
**Ijkaase**: Merit will mobilize in here.
**Ijkaase**: Also the week of Memorial Day.
**Ijkaase**: Right now we also have foundations scheduled to start June 3rd.
**Ijkaase**: What's your duration on the foundations for this building, Kagan?
**Ijkaase**: I think right now we have plugged in two weeks for them.
**Ijkaase**: Two weeks.
**Ijkaase**: Okay.
**Ijkaase**: Spoils for your perimeter just cast outside the building.
**Ijkaase**: Interior column pads just skid, steer them out and we'll have a location, a spot where you guys just, you know, stock them.
**Kpeters**: Okay.
**Ijkaase**: Concrete washout is on site for you right up here.
**Ijkaase**: Anything needs is needed on it.
**Ijkaase**: Like if you need a new one, you can come in, ask me or Andrew or Ian and any one of us can just swap it out on our apps.
**Ijkaase**: Perfect.
**Ijkaase**: What is your duration, Brennan?
**Ijkaase**: You're thinking on the primary power and then also light poles.
**Kpeters**: I think we'll have it.
**Kpeters**: We can have it all week.
**Ijkaase**: All in a week.
**Ijkaase**: Five days for them on that.
**Ijkaase**: Okay, so after Merit gets done with the foundations.
**Ijkaase**: Merit is actually going to roll their guys right into the parking lot, start doing curbs and everything.
**Ijkaase**: So I just need to make sure we've got your light pole bases in before they get going on that.
**Kpeters**: Yeah.
**Kpeters**: So what we'll probably do is get all of our conduit in, and then we like to do the light poles after the curbs just to prevent any whoopsies on the elevation.
**Ijkaase**: No, that's fine.
**Ijkaase**: That's fine.
**Ijkaase**: Just when we do that, just let's.
**Ijkaase**: Let's be very mindful of the curbs.
**Ijkaase**: That.
**Ijkaase**: That way Merit's not out here.
**Ijkaase**: Done them twice.
**Kpeters**: No, yeah, I get it.
**Ijkaase**: Let's see.
**Ijkaase**: Sanitary is done.
**Kpeters**: You have control points, right?
**Ijkaase**: Yes, we have all the control points.
**Ijkaase**: Yes.
**Ijkaase**: Okay, so.
**Ijkaase**: So I still need those.
**Ijkaase**: I'll have Ian, our intern, he.
**Ijkaase**: He'll often email those to Brennan.
**Ijkaase**: You want them emailed to you, Brennan, or do you want them emailed to that Robert guy?
**Kpeters**: If you could email him to me.
**Kpeters**: He's out of town right now.
**Ijkaase**: Okay.
**Ijkaase**: And so, Brennan.
**Ctragesser**: Kagan.
**Ijkaase**: You won't need the control points, will you?
**Ijkaase**: No, not really.
**Ijkaase**: Or surveyor may, but.
**Ijkaase**: Because I'm gonna have him come out and grid the lot before we get on it.
**Ijkaase**: But as long as the perimeter staking is good, we should be fine.
**Ijkaase**: So can you email those to Brennan with Dean and Kagan with Merit after this meeting?
**Kpeters**: Okay.
**Ijkaase**: And then if you need.
**Ijkaase**: If you do need them, just ask me and he can get them to you.
**Ijkaase**: Okay.
**Ijkaase**: Is there anything else you're needing on our end, Brennan?
**Kpeters**: Yeah, real quick.
**Kpeters**: I'm looking at the civil set.
**Kpeters**: I just want to see what this is going to do to us.
**Ctragesser**: Let me try.
**Kpeters**: I'm trying to get a measurement here off of.
**Kpeters**: Off the driveway.
**Kpeters**: See where that gas goes.
**Kpeters**: Because it looks like they got our gas, our communications, and our power all going, like, to the same spot.
**Kpeters**: And I see that there.
**Ijkaase**: So they've got gas running basically right.
**Ijkaase**: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 spots to the west of that curb island.
**Ijkaase**: And you've got your power coming in right there also.
**Kpeters**: Yeah, I'm getting to see how far it is off the drive.
**Ijkaase**: There's your transformer.
**Ijkaase**: So it looks like we got about 15ft between the center of your transformer and that gas line.
**Kpeters**: Well, what about out by the road, though?
**Kpeters**: Because that's where they're.
**Kpeters**: They're going to have to tap in.
**Ijkaase**: Can you see my screen?
**Ijkaase**: Whereabouts are they making that tap?
**Kpeters**: I'm showing the gas, like, 135ft off the drive and the power.
**Kpeters**: Oh, that means I gotta go under the gas line.
**Ijkaase**: Are you talking about the existing gas line or the new gas line?
**Ijkaase**: New gas line, yeah, you'll have to go under it.
**Ijkaase**: It's not in yet.
**Kpeters**: But.
**Ijkaase**: And I can tell you this, so it.
**Ijkaase**: Where it taps into the gas line out there by the road, that existing gas line that it's teeing into is only about 32 inches down from the road.
**Kpeters**: Okay.
**Ijkaase**: New gas service, I believe right now it's scheduled roughly for mid Jews.
**Ijkaase**: So I mean, honestly, if you got in before them, you know, you, you know, you just got to be deeper than them.
**Ijkaase**: At least then you're not digging.
**Ijkaase**: Digging through where there's gas line being ran.
**Kpeters**: Yeah, you see my screen?
**Ijkaase**: No, I cannot.
**Ijkaase**: Hold on a second.
**Ijkaase**: Yeah, I see it now.
**Kpeters**: Never mind.
**Kpeters**: I'm going need.
**Kpeters**: That's water this back to just delete it.
**Kpeters**: Try this again.
**Kpeters**: Gas is like 70.
**Kpeters**: So yeah, we'll be, we'll be fine on gas.
**Kpeters**: It's the water, but we'll go over top of the water.
**Kpeters**: How deep's the water?
**Ijkaase**: 54 inches?
**Kpeters**: Yeah, we'll go over the top of it.
**Kpeters**: So.
**Ijkaase**: So you're gonna bring your gas line in.
**Ijkaase**: You, you wouldn't just run straight north to that transformer after you pass the gas line?
**Kpeters**: Yeah, essentially like so right here you got our transformer.
**Kpeters**: We're just, we're gonna run a conduit virtually straight south to the road.
**Kpeters**: And then utility is gonna.
**Kpeters**: From that point.
**Kpeters**: I don't know if they're gonna put a tap box in or they're gonna do an underground tab or they're gonna splice it.
**Kpeters**: Essentially right here.
**Ijkaase**: Okay.
**Ijkaase**: Yeah.
**Ijkaase**: So you'll have to cross the storm and that water line, you'll be crossing the water line that runs out to the hydrant in that island.
**Kpeters**: Okay.
**Kpeters**: Storms probably.
**Kpeters**: It's pretty deep too, right?
**Ijkaase**: Storm there.
**Ijkaase**: I'll have to check on the elevation there because that actually is coming up.
**Ijkaase**: So that may not be as deep as what we think there.
**Ijkaase**: I'll have to check into that one for you.
**Ijkaase**: That's structure 608.
**Kpeters**: Okay.
**Ijkaase**: Okay.
**Ijkaase**: Anything else?
**Ijkaase**: Are we waiting on anything from you guys?
**Ijkaase**: Glenn, do you know if we're waiting on anything from game on your end?
**Ctragesser**: I don't, I don't, I don't have anything that I'm waiting on specifically for many subs right now.
**Ctragesser**: We're working through rebar shops and other than that, as soon as we get this ilp, we'll get, get going to Underground electric.
**Ctragesser**: I don't know if I missed deemed.
**Ctragesser**: Did you guys have anything further scheduled for the transformer to.
**Ctragesser**: To arrive on site?
**Ctragesser**: Merit is going to do the transformer pad on this one.
**Ctragesser**: So we just need to coordinate, you know, coordinate location, final location and everything with you guys.
**Ctragesser**: Since you're not pouring it.
**Ctragesser**: When.
**Ctragesser**: When do you expect the transformer to be out here to.
**Ctragesser**: To set that?
**Ctragesser**: Just a rough estimate.
**Kpeters**: When he.
**Kpeters**: Woody met him out there.
**Kpeters**: I think that they said that they had transformers in stock, so really it'll be just a matter of.
**Kpeters**: Once we get the panel, the main distribution panel in and the pads poured, conduits all done, I think they'll come out.
**Kpeters**: Hook it up right away.
**Ctragesser**: Okay.
**Ctragesser**: So hoping or on pace to get our CVR here around the.
**Ctragesser**: What do we say Chad, the 20 or the third today?
**Ijkaase**: Yeah.
**Ijkaase**: Yeah.
**Ctragesser**: So the week of this, the week of the second or the week after that would be about the time we'd have you guys out here starting your underground primary secondaries, light pole bases and stuff like that.
**Ctragesser**: So is that, is that what you're tracking?
**Kpeters**: Yeah.
**Ctragesser**: Okay.
**Ctragesser**: Yeah, that's.
**Ctragesser**: That's all I had about the transformer.
**Ctragesser**: I think everything else is covered right now.
**Ijkaase**: Okay.
**Ijkaase**: Chance, you're a month out still, so really nothing for you.
**Ijkaase**: You don't need anything from us, do you?
**Ijkaase**: Just we need to find out did we swap the paving on the path to the 12 mil.
**Ijkaase**: I.
**Ijkaase**: Yeah, I need to get with Alec to make sure that there's an answer on that one.
**Ijkaase**: And then the only other thing that I can think staking prior to us being here, typically what we like to do is we like to use, you know, a sub for the staking, get all the perimeter in and if we have to use our in house guys to touch some things up or add a couple that have been knocked out, that's what we, we would like.
**Ijkaase**: So maybe just some prep staking before we get in.
**Kpeters**: Okay.
**Ijkaase**: And I can give you information on that one, on what these are.
**Ijkaase**: Okay.
**Ijkaase**: And then Kagan with anything from.
**Ijkaase**: For you.
**Ijkaase**: You need anything from us.
**Ijkaase**: You've got all your submittals now.
**Ijkaase**: You've got concrete shops are already in, we've gone over those.
**Ijkaase**: I'm working on just fixing the detail.
**Kpeters**: For the volleyball perimeter.
**Ijkaase**: And I'll just need roof shops or just improve some mills come back.
**Ijkaase**: I haven't seen them come back yet.
**Ijkaase**: I don't have any concerns about anything.
**Kpeters**: Coming back, rejected or revised that I've.
**Ijkaase**: Already submitted to you.
**Ijkaase**: We need to get you the volleyball Court sleeves.
**Ijkaase**: Yes, we do.
**Ijkaase**: Okay, so Alito will contact Katie and coordinate the volleyball sleeves, getting them out here.
**Ijkaase**: So that way when you guys are in there, you can get all that done all at once instead of having to make multiple trips in there.
**Ijkaase**: All right, I think that's.
**Ctragesser**: Ian, make sure you capture that on your notes as an action item for.
**Ctragesser**: For today.
**Ijkaase**: Andrew, anything bad?
**Ijkaase**: Ian, good.
**Ijkaase**: Glenn?
**Ctragesser**: That's it.
**Ijkaase**: All right, thank you, guys.
**Ijkaase**: Chad, hold up.
**Ijkaase**: What you got, Brennan?
**Kpeters**: I.
**Kpeters**: I was supposed to send you guys a markup where to put styrofoam in the service condos.
**Kpeters**: Come in before they pour the thin wall or.
**Ijkaase**: Okay.
**Kpeters**: Whatever it is.
**Ijkaase**: Yep.
**Ijkaase**: Markup on that yet.
**Kpeters**: Be the best one to mark that up on mine or the actual foundation?
**Ijkaase**: I would probably say on the actual foundation plan.
**Kpeters**: Okay.
**Ijkaase**: I just.
**Ijkaase**: Yeah, I would mark it up on there and then I'll just coordinate that with merit.
**Ijkaase**: All right, the other thing, are you guys grounding to the foundation at all?
**Kpeters**: Yeah, we gotta hit.
**Kpeters**: Good, Good point.
**Kpeters**: We gotta hit two pieces of rebar in the footers 20ft apart.
**Kpeters**: So if they could leave us a little.
**Kpeters**: Okay.
**Ijkaase**: So a couple pieces taken out probably next week.
**Ijkaase**: Monday or.
**Ijkaase**: No, probably on Tuesday.
**Ijkaase**: I'll give you a call and.
**Ijkaase**: Because I'll know merit schedule better then.
**Ijkaase**: That way when they're digging and they're putting bar in right behind, you can send somebody out and you know, because they're gonna.
**Ijkaase**: You guys are gonna dig.
**Ijkaase**: What?
**Ijkaase**: Start digging the morning.
**Ijkaase**: You're gonna dig all day, have inspection at probably 1, 2 maybe, and then.
**Ijkaase**: And then pour at 3.
**Ijkaase**: So, I mean, that gives you at least a good three, four hour window.
**Ijkaase**: Brennan, to get that in.
**Ijkaase**: Will that work?
**Kpeters**: Just need, like when they do their rebar, if they could just bend a 90 on one of them and have it sticking out outside.
**Kpeters**: I don't know if they're.
**Kpeters**: Are they doing like.
**Kpeters**: Are they forming or just pouring in the dirt?
**Ijkaase**: No, they're firming.
**Ijkaase**: They're forming.
**Ijkaase**: No earth, thankfully.
**Kpeters**: Yeah.
**Kpeters**: So I mean, really, if.
**Kpeters**: As long as we know where that piece of rebar sticking out is, we can dig and find it later.
**Ijkaase**: Okay.
**Kpeters**: And then we'll cad weld onto it.
**Ijkaase**: Okay.
**Ijkaase**: And you need two locations on that.
**Kpeters**: Yeah, 20ft apart within the vicinity of the electric service.
**Kpeters**: I'll mark something up and send it to you.
**Ijkaase**: Perfect.
**Ctragesser**: All right.
**Ijkaase**: And you said 20ft apart?
**Kpeters**: Yep.
**Ijkaase**: All right, sounds good.
**Ijkaase**: Anything else?
**Ijkaase**: Anything else, Bryn?
**Kpeters**: Good.
**Ijkaase**: Okay, thank you, guys.
**Kpeters**: Thank you.
**Ijkaase**: Sam.
