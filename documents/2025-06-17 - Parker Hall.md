## Transcript
**Bclymer**: Nine or ten, I think.
**Bclymer**: I think estimated and even helped project manage it back then.
**Bclymer**: And no, I don't think the building has had any upgrade whatsoever since that point in time.
**Parkerh**: Yeah, when I started with mj.
**Bclymer**: I.
**Parkerh**: Pull up and it's like it's a bunch of trailers because back at the old, you know, Bobby's house and, and it was like a house with a bunch of mobile like trailers like tied together.
**Parkerh**: And that was the office.
**Bclymer**: But I, I was not on board yet then.
**Bclymer**: But I've seen different images and stories over the un I feel like I'm familiar with it.
**Parkerh**: Yep, it was the good old days.
**Parkerh**: Danny Banks, is he still around?
**Parkerh**: He's there in Birmingham.
**Bclymer**: We still do work for Danny.
**Parkerh**: That's awesome.
**Bclymer**: He's still around.
**Parkerh**: Yeah, he was.
**Parkerh**: I was scared to death of that guy when I first started.
**Bclymer**: Sure, I was too.
**Parkerh**: That's awesome.
**Parkerh**: Well, I'm glad Jim introduced us.
**Parkerh**: I'm waiting for Brandon to join.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, well, just seeing your face, I feel like we probably shook hands at some point, you know, a lifetime ago.
**Bclymer**: But.
**Bclymer**: But I agree.
**Bclymer**: I appreciate Jim reconnecting us.
**Parkerh**: What jobs were you on back in the day?
**Parkerh**: I was there until.
**Parkerh**: I think I finished that proper blow.
**Parkerh**: Well, I did Poplar Bluff, then I went to.
**Parkerh**: Went to.
**Parkerh**: Is it Jefferson City or.
**Parkerh**: No, somewhere near Birmingham.
**Parkerh**: I did the.
**Parkerh**: Jeff.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah, I know that job was a tough one.
**Bclymer**: So just to give you a brief history on me, I mean, I worked for a little small contractor in Montgomery like through college, and then I moved up here to work for brass field.
**Bclymer**: So most of my field time was with that small company.
**Bclymer**: And then I was on site with Brassfield a couple years, really eager to get on the road.
**Bclymer**: And I won't bore you with my.
**Bclymer**: My personal story, but every project I was on was in downtown Birmingham and MJ recruited me, I ended up shifting into healthcare.
**Bclymer**: Healthcare division in Brashville.
**Bclymer**: And MJ recruited me.
**Bclymer**: The opening was in pre con.
**Bclymer**: It's not what I wanted to do, but I got pretty good at it pretty quickly and I've been here 18.
**Parkerh**: Years now, so that's awesome.
**Bclymer**: So I never really was in the field for MJ, but I do feel like, you know, over those 18 years being pretty hand in hand.
**Bclymer**: And I'm gonna tell you, I don't know what you remember, but you know, between me and Matt hall and no, no relation.
**Parkerh**: By the way, I was gonna say is that call, tell Matt he's your daddy.
**Bclymer**: Now.
**Bclymer**: I've made.
**Bclymer**: I've been Matt's Daddy time or two.
**Bclymer**: You know, me and Matt hall and Adam and Zena, we have a new, newer guy that wasn't here when you were here.
**Bclymer**: His name is Rob Harris.
**Bclymer**: No relation to the Harrisons.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, we worked really, really hard to make this a better place.
**Bclymer**: And I think it's night and day from what it.
**Bclymer**: What it used to be, so.
**Bclymer**: Been pretty happy with where we've gotten to.
**Parkerh**: Oh yeah, I've always liked Matt.
**Parkerh**: He was one of my favorite people to work with there.
**Parkerh**: Adam and Xena was a co op for me back in the day on.
**Parkerh**: Back in the day in Phoenix City, Alabama.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, that was a Head south job.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So I actually did leave for about two years.
**Bclymer**: I left like 11 and 12 to help start a little startup company that sold out and then Mike was begging me to come back, but.
**Bclymer**: So I really wasn't involved on pop or bluff.
**Bclymer**: I was on the mob stuff there at the end.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, but that midfield, you know, I feel like every job I at least had my hands on at some point.
**Bclymer**: You know what I mean?
**Bclymer**: I remember all the jobs, so.
**Parkerh**: I remember like your name's very familiar.
**Parkerh**: Even though I don't know that we got to work directly together.
**Parkerh**: But yeah, I'm sure there was probably.
**Bclymer**: Several layers in between us at those.
**Bclymer**: In those days, you know what I mean?
**Bclymer**: But who.
**Bclymer**: Give me, give me a little background.
**Bclymer**: Is somebody else joining you?
**Bclymer**: Said yeah.
**Parkerh**: So Brandon, he's just finishing up a call.
**Parkerh**: Just messaged me.
**Parkerh**: He'll get on here as soon as he's off.
**Parkerh**: So, you know, a lot of the MJ guys went over to d' Angelo's diamond, you know, like Eric Bracken's over there, Jason Sane went over there, Reggie Morgan went over there, Bruce Young went over there.
**Parkerh**: So I was in Puerto Rico because when I left MJ Harris at that Jeff City that time, the Jefferson county project, I went to Puerto Rico and I helped.
**Parkerh**: I was one of the PM's building the mall of San Juan.
**Parkerh**: So I lived there for like a year and a half and you know, this was like a 247 million dollar project as a.
**Parkerh**: Just a gigantic mall there.
**Bclymer**: And.
**Parkerh**: You know, I was the last person there the mall had opened, you know, and so I.
**Parkerh**: They had me working nights and I hated that, you know, because they were adding escalators in there.
**Parkerh**: And so I decided I wanted to.
**Parkerh**: I always loved Florida and it just happened.
**Parkerh**: I was flying back and Nick Pear, which is crazy, I met him in Puerto Rico.
**Parkerh**: He was on an MJ Harris job.
**Parkerh**: I think there Maybe it was dangerous.
**Bclymer**: He was a pop of bluff.
**Parkerh**: Yeah.
**Parkerh**: Nick was a popular bluff.
**Parkerh**: Yeah.
**Parkerh**: And so I met him there and then I was flying back and Jason saying I met him in the airport and he's like, hey, you should join us.
**Parkerh**: And so I went in and you know, I've known Reggie.
**Parkerh**: He was the PM on a project and down in Florida they sent me down to that was screwed up to help out on.
**Parkerh**: So I got to know Reggie.
**Parkerh**: And so it was easy going over there.
**Parkerh**: I knew half the people at Danza's diamond.
**Parkerh**: So they stuck me with 4 health.
**Parkerh**: Like I had a hospital tower expansion, vertical expansion, renovating another hospital, three stories building, a four story or addition to a hospital in Miami, and a complete ed renovation at another hospital.
**Parkerh**: And I had two APMs that sucked.
**Parkerh**: And so the one quit.
**Parkerh**: And I interviewed Brandon and he became in as my APM and we worked together there at DeAngelos diamond for several years.
**Parkerh**: And you know, he left to join a startup company and, you know, we always kept in touch with friends.
**Parkerh**: And so then he started his own company three years ago and was always wanting me to join him.
**Parkerh**: And he based it out of Indianapolis is where he started.
**Parkerh**: And that because he's from Indiana.
**Parkerh**: And then I finished up a condo project in Clearwater.
**Parkerh**: It was about a year ago that I joined Brandon.
**Parkerh**: So here's Brandon right now.
**Speaker 2**: Oh, talk about a pain in the ass.
**Parkerh**: Yeah, that day.
**Parkerh**: Yeah.
**Parkerh**: So this is Brandon.
**Parkerh**: Brandon, this Parker Hall.
**Parkerh**: We were just catching up.
**Parkerh**: You know, he.
**Parkerh**: We crossed paths at MJ Harris a little bit.
**Parkerh**: You know, we were in kind of different.
**Parkerh**: Different areas of the world for him at the time.
**Parkerh**: But he's been there for 18 years.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Speaker 2**: Nice.
**Parkerh**: Yeah, I was just telling him a little bit about how we met and how you started your company three years ago.
**Parkerh**: So been here in a year and everything is just blowing up.
**Parkerh**: So literally.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: We just can't build anything.
**Speaker 2**: Right.
**Speaker 2**: They're just blowing it up.
**Bclymer**: So forgive me, I'm probably a little under prepared.
**Bclymer**: Jim Parker is a long time, you know, friend in the industry.
**Bclymer**: That's who hooked us up here.
**Bclymer**: But really, outside of a five minute conversation with Jim, you know, I haven't.
**Bclymer**: I haven't really researched you guys.
**Bclymer**: Tell me, what's the name of the firm?
**Speaker 2**: Alito.
**Speaker 2**: A L L E A T O.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And you're based where?
**Speaker 2**: We have an office in Tampa area and then one in Indy.
**Bclymer**: Gotcha.
**Bclymer**: We've got a couple of projects going on in Indy right now.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: What?
**Bclymer**: The client is Acadia Acadia.
**Speaker 2**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So we're doing a couple with Acadia, and then we're looking at a.
**Bclymer**: Another rehab client to do one in Kokomo just up the.
**Bclymer**: Up the street.
**Bclymer**: We, you know, We've been in 38 states over the years, so I don't know, probably done four or five in Indianapolis over the years, but those two going on Indy right now.
**Bclymer**: I was messing with one of the young guys on the site last night, how he's been trying to get into Game 6 of the NBA.
**Bclymer**: He said he couldn't get tickets.
**Speaker 2**: Oh, yeah, yeah.
**Speaker 2**: There.
**Speaker 2**: I haven't even looked at them, but I'm sure they're pricey.
**Speaker 2**: I.
**Speaker 2**: I took a client to game three, you know, which I don't even like basketball, but it was so fun, right?
**Speaker 2**: So, yeah, it's.
**Speaker 2**: It's crazy.
**Speaker 2**: Especially tonight.
**Speaker 2**: Or is it tonight or.
**Speaker 2**: I don't know what night.
**Bclymer**: I don't know.
**Bclymer**: I feel like they take a night off, so I guess it'll be more night.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, yeah.
**Speaker 2**: Because it was in Oklahoma.
**Speaker 2**: I know that.
**Speaker 2**: So it'll be nuts because they lost the other night.
**Speaker 2**: So this is like winter.
**Speaker 2**: Winter.
**Bclymer**: You're done, right?
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: So I'm not surprised.
**Speaker 2**: It's sold out.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: What, what kind of markets have y' all been in?
**Bclymer**: What kind of projects and, and what projects are we specifically talking about today?
**Speaker 2**: So we've got, you know, we do decent amount of industrial, and then we've got Aspire Health.
**Speaker 2**: We've been building a portfolio with them.
**Speaker 2**: So we just started working with them like, what, almost a year ago.
**Speaker 2**: Maybe Jesse or something like that.
**Parkerh**: Yep.
**Parkerh**: Aspire Health here in Florida.
**Speaker 2**: So that relationship's growing.
**Speaker 2**: You know, I mean, I'd say that honestly the biggest thing that we run into is like, we just, like we, we get so busy, we don't have a ton of time to even go out and prospect.
**Speaker 2**: You know, we've got, you know, we just got a 40 million dollar, you know, hotel deal in, in Fort Whitworth, you know, Savannah area that we're starting designs on.
**Speaker 2**: Then we, you know, we've got this big development down in Fort Myers.
**Speaker 2**: It's 1.2 billion.
**Speaker 2**: So working on getting that thing, you know, that's taking up a lot of my time and Jesse's get working on getting that thing finalized on all the numbers and everything, you know, hoping to get that deal, you know, closed and inked, you know, by November would be great.
**Speaker 2**: So.
**Speaker 2**: And that's a bit, you know, it's couple condos, retail component, a marina so it's got a bunch of different aspects to it.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: And then your general commercial and TI stuff.
**Bclymer**: Okay, how, how can I help?
**Parkerh**: Well, what we need is like help in the estimating department because we like, you know, now it's kind of.
**Parkerh**: We had an estimated that was working for us, you know, they were remote and it just wasn't really much of a help.
**Parkerh**: So it ends up falling on US and our PMs and project engineers.
**Parkerh**: And we're trying to get these, you know, get these either budgets or actual quotes put together.
**Parkerh**: So that's what we need.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: If you're getting up into billion dollar projects, that's pretty hard to focus on that and managing other projects as well, you know.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so you currently don't have any precondition dedicated people on staff?
**Parkerh**: Nope, nope.
**Parkerh**: And think about like this brand.
**Parkerh**: You know, Alito's been around for three years and like that growth is like, you know, that's what we're like.
**Parkerh**: Just in the last year, it's, it's crazy.
**Parkerh**: All the work that we're getting just almost handed to us that, you know, now we gotta, you know, we've hired a lot of people to perform the jobs, but you know, now the next step is we gotta get that pre construction department.
**Parkerh**: Got to get the, someone to get these estimates together.
**Bclymer**: Just for context, do you mind if I asked how many employees you're at right now.
**Speaker 2**: Jesse?
**Speaker 2**: How many we have?
**Speaker 2**: 20, 22, something like that.
**Parkerh**: Yeah.
**Parkerh**: Total.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: The biggest thing, you know, Parker, like when I built this company in most construction they're all like get to work low margins, but you do a bunch of it.
**Speaker 2**: I don't agree with that.
**Speaker 2**: And so we work off of a lot higher margins.
**Speaker 2**: Like, you know, we just did a project in Pennsylvania at 45%.
**Speaker 2**: You know, what kind of what, what.
**Bclymer**: Market sector is that?
**Speaker 2**: Industrial.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I do, I do see industrial getting higher margins.
**Bclymer**: 45% pretty.
**Bclymer**: That's a pretty big lick.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, I mean, and you know, we, so we, we, we do this.
**Speaker 2**: Basically.
**Speaker 2**: It's.
**Speaker 2**: I created a niche market for so mhe material handling equipment in, in warehouses.
**Speaker 2**: So we work with integrators and do all the, you know, infrastructure that's needed to run that.
**Speaker 2**: So you might build a, a warehouse, you know, the, and like, so the office build out maybe whatever, three, four million dollars, you know, to build your office pods around it.
**Speaker 2**: But the MHE is 65, 70 million.
**Speaker 2**: Right.
**Speaker 2**: It's the engineering there pulls from a different pool of money.
**Speaker 2**: And so it's not like when you're dealing with the construction Manager, they're like, 5% is the most we pay.
**Speaker 2**: Like, no, these guys are like, can you get it done?
**Speaker 2**: Yes, here's my number.
**Speaker 2**: So that's.
**Speaker 2**: That's allowed us to, you know, not have to sit there and scrape.
**Speaker 2**: You know, we pretty particular about who we work with.
**Speaker 2**: I mean, we, you know, with.
**Speaker 2**: When he was the valor, we talked with him.
**Speaker 2**: He was trying to throw this condo and then a.
**Speaker 2**: Like a big tower and everything and, you know, basically, you know, trying to bully us.
**Speaker 2**: And I was like, we don't need you.
**Speaker 2**: So, no, you know, this is our number.
**Speaker 2**: This is what we need to make.
**Speaker 2**: And if that's not your cup of tea, no worries.
**Speaker 2**: Somebody else will do it.
**Speaker 2**: Right.
**Speaker 2**: You know, so, yeah, I mean, margins and, you know, having adequate numbers are important.
**Speaker 2**: That's why we're very particular about who we.
**Bclymer**: We pick.
**Speaker 2**: Like, I mean, that.
**Speaker 2**: That hotel's got 10 on it.
**Parkerh**: That's what's different too.
**Parkerh**: Like, we don't go search the bid list or the project list coming out, and you just bid against 10 other subs.
**Parkerh**: Like, we got return, you know, repeat clients that just like, here's the job.
**Parkerh**: So a lot of these things are simply.
**Parkerh**: Put us a budget together and we give it to them and then we do the work.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Sounds like y' all built some pretty good relationships there.
**Bclymer**: That's hard work to get.
**Bclymer**: Or at least has been in my career.
**Bclymer**: We've done a lot.
**Bclymer**: A lot of good stuff, you know what I mean?
**Bclymer**: Which we're good at.
**Bclymer**: Pays the bills, keeps the cash flow where we need it, but I hear you.
**Bclymer**: So what are y' all looking for?
**Bclymer**: Y' all.
**Bclymer**: Y' all looking to make a hire?
**Bclymer**: Y' all looking for some consulting?
**Bclymer**: How can I help?
**Speaker 2**: So, you know, you know, we're definitely open to ideas, I guess.
**Speaker 2**: You know, part of the question and thought is what are you looking for, if anything, for that matter?
**Speaker 2**: For me, Correct.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I'm probably not looking to make a move, if that's the question.
**Bclymer**: I have.
**Bclymer**: I started years ago a little side business where I have consulted for some local real estate developers, commercial developers, and through that side business, I mean, I actually acted as their rep several times, did some budgeting, managed some of the construction, or consulted on the management of the construction.
**Bclymer**: I don't do that a lot anymore because, one, I have way too much responsibility here, and two, I got three kids in elementary school, and I think my wife was pregnant with my second one or my second one born and I was working every night and every weekend, you know, trying to make some money on the side.
**Bclymer**: I definitely have some skills there that could benefit you from a, from a consulting standpoint.
**Bclymer**: But when we're talking about projects of this size, you know, that's a big deal.
**Bclymer**: You know, if we're talking quick, high level budgets, needing somebody, my expertise, expertise.
**Bclymer**: And I could absolutely do some, some on the side consulting temporarily to y' all get, you know, where you need to be.
**Bclymer**: So that's, that's, that's kind of one avenue.
**Bclymer**: Another avenue would be actually offering pre construction services through MJ Harris, which we have also done.
**Bclymer**: We don't do it a ton.
**Bclymer**: We normally would do that with our clients that we're building for, but we have done it a few times where somebody needed some consulting.
**Bclymer**: And you know that, that's when you get into, I'm having to assign a team to it.
**Bclymer**: And we got some pretty sizable billable hours to actually put together, you know, actual numbers at CD or whatever level that's needed.
**Bclymer**: And of course, if we were to go that route, you know, it'd be me and Robbie Egan.
**Bclymer**: Robbie Egan is the, the final decision maker on, on what we pursue.
**Bclymer**: It's usually me, them making those decisions together.
**Bclymer**: But yeah, I don't know if any of that sounds like it would be helpful to you guys or not.
**Bclymer**: You let me know.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, yeah.
**Parkerh**: I mean, Jesse, so when you say, you know, doing the consulting, would that be like we'd send you.
**Parkerh**: You know, a lot of times we'll get basically a scope of work written out in a plan.
**Parkerh**: Let's say it's a warehouse and they're like, we want these certain things done and these things added that you would be able to throw that in and just get us a working budget for it based on.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So what I'd probably do is I'd quote you a review at whatever level of documents that you wanted.
**Bclymer**: Sdd, cd.
**Bclymer**: I would prepare a in house budget myself to prepare against.
**Bclymer**: But then I would essentially just be reviewing whatever estimate, you know, y' all came up with, just as a, as a coach, you know, just let me take a look.
**Bclymer**: Same as I would do with my team here.
**Bclymer**: When I've got an estimator who's working on something, you know, I want to review it and make sure there's no mistakes, you know.
**Bclymer**: So yes, I would help put together some of those high level budgets, but no, I would not be leading your final estimates.
**Bclymer**: Right, you'd be putting your own estimates together with my Consultant.
**Bclymer**: I just don't have the time.
**Bclymer**: I don't have the manpower to do anything more on my own.
**Bclymer**: The MJ Harris Avenue, you know, we, it would, it would be an invoice job.
**Bclymer**: But you have my team working on actually putting the number together, which again, we have done that before.
**Bclymer**: I don't know if I've ever done it for another contractor.
**Bclymer**: That way things might be a little messy just with who's sending out what and making what phone calls.
**Bclymer**: You know what I mean?
**Bclymer**: We'd have to think through that sort of thing.
**Speaker 2**: Right?
**Bclymer**: Especially if there's avenues where we may ever compete against one another.
**Parkerh**: Right?
**Parkerh**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Parkerh**: I was hoping you'd say, listen, I, this place, I'm ready to quit.
**Bclymer**: Well, there are some days I do say that.
**Speaker 2**: No, there's days I say.
**Bclymer**: I mean, I'm in on the equity piece now and got a pretty big role.
**Bclymer**: I, I, I'm not going to reveal everything, but I will say there's a timetable that if things aren't going like I want them to go that day, we'll get here.
**Bclymer**: But I'm in a pretty good spot right this minute to where I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna shake it up until it's time.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Speaker 2**: Makes sense.
**Parkerh**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I'm also not really interested in relocating either, if that was part of the deal.
**Bclymer**: I heard you say you had somebody remote.
**Bclymer**: That's not a long term solution in my opinion.
**Bclymer**: You need a real pre.
**Bclymer**: Kind leader.
**Bclymer**: And I'll be honest with you, I lead business development and marketing under my wing too.
**Bclymer**: So a lot of my time is actually spent building those relationships like y' all were talking about and then also guiding our PRECON department and our business development.
**Bclymer**: But I don't, I don't think I'd be the guy that you're looking for to chain to a desk and turn out a bunch of estimates at this, at this point.
**Bclymer**: I can train, I can, I can lead a bunch of people doing that.
**Bclymer**: But hell, these software is the day I gotta let them use the softwares.
**Bclymer**: You know what I mean?
**Bclymer**: They kind of passed me by a little bit.
**Bclymer**: I mean, I have to explain it to them.
**Bclymer**: They don't know what they're doing, but they can run the programs better than I can run.
**Parkerh**: What do you guys use?
**Bclymer**: We currently.
**Bclymer**: So forever we used ost, which I remember I was at Brassfield still doing takeoffs by hand when OSD came out and I was blown away.
**Speaker 2**: On screen.
**Speaker 2**: Still prevalent.
**Speaker 2**: I mean, they're still using.
**Bclymer**: Well, it is And I'll tell you, I'm giving away free advice here about three or four years ago and we've grown a lot in the last 10 years to where we're getting a lot of projects in here that are 70, 80, $150 million.
**Bclymer**: And these drawing packages were getting so cumbersome in the OST software.
**Bclymer**: And OST rolled out a, or I say it's ost Construct Connect or whoever bought them.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Rolled out a cloud based program.
**Bclymer**: It's called, I think it's called Construct Connect, Takeoff.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Which is basically ost.
**Bclymer**: Same stuff with cloud, it's web based, cloud based.
**Bclymer**: And it operates kind of like Pro Core.
**Bclymer**: So you can addendize all those.
**Bclymer**: Then you know, you'll get an addendum of 300 freaking drawings.
**Bclymer**: And used to be you have to manually stick them in there just like we stuck manually stick them in the drawing sets on the job site.
**Bclymer**: You know what I mean?
**Bclymer**: But now it just, it's just, it saves a lot of time on the estimator to use that software.
**Bclymer**: So we switched to that a couple of years ago and then we use the old school timberline for the estimates which I was an absolute guru in that program for a long, long time.
**Bclymer**: And eventually I think we'll have to switch away from it.
**Bclymer**: It's gotten, it's gotten outdated.
**Bclymer**: But we currently still use Timber.
**Parkerh**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: What about you?
**Bclymer**: We.
**Speaker 2**: So we just started using Job Planner.
**Speaker 2**: We're testing out there, estimating stuff and then you Building Connected.
**Speaker 2**: You know, I, you know, we tested out a few kind of in the market.
**Speaker 2**: There's so many, you know, trying to see what's got the maximum flexibility but also gets the job done.
**Speaker 2**: I like, we liked Building Connected.
**Speaker 2**: They changed their pricing model to be like what procore does where they bill you off percent, which is like.
**Speaker 2**: I'm like, what do you mean?
**Speaker 2**: Like that means that I could go get estimates and we not win the job and I'm paying for it.
**Speaker 2**: That's ridiculous.
**Bclymer**: I agree.
**Parkerh**: Yep.
**Speaker 2**: So yeah, so we're, we're definitely open.
**Speaker 2**: I mean again, we're trying to other things.
**Speaker 2**: So just, you know that that pricing model is just stupid.
**Bclymer**: I agree.
**Bclymer**: Pro Core too.
**Bclymer**: You got to state your volume before you acquired all the volume.
**Bclymer**: And then if you do more, you got to pay them more but do less, they don't give you a rebate.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, exactly.
**Speaker 2**: That's why like we said, we dropped procore because it's just ridiculous and went with Job Planner, you know, and it's, it's A fraction of the cost.
**Speaker 2**: Right.
**Parkerh**: So, yeah, they're close to copying everything on Procore.
**Parkerh**: So it'll be just like Procore.
**Bclymer**: Like, it's just like cable providers, you know what I mean?
**Bclymer**: They suck in.
**Bclymer**: And then once you're.
**Bclymer**: Once you're comfortable in doing it, then they can jack the price up.
**Bclymer**: So now you got to go back over the other one.
**Bclymer**: It's a pain in the ass to whichever they have.
**Speaker 2**: Well, that's why people still use Timberline.
**Speaker 2**: You know, I'm not such in my.
**Bclymer**: Accounting software, but Timberline, I mean, it's cost almost nothing.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, probably.
**Bclymer**: We don't get very good service, and there's no good updates to it.
**Speaker 2**: Right.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: All right, well, y' all.
**Bclymer**: Y' all.
**Bclymer**: I mean, I was very happy to make the.
**Bclymer**: Make the introduction here.
**Bclymer**: I mean, y' all tell me if.
**Bclymer**: If I can be of help at all.
**Parkerh**: Yeah, no, it was good.
**Parkerh**: Good to talk to you again and catch up and, like, let's have to see if, you know, we just got to figure this out, how we're going to get this estimating running a little better, so.
**Bclymer**: Well, I know hiring has been difficult since COVID Really.
**Bclymer**: And I.
**Bclymer**: I'm not trying to say this just because I'm on the pre.
**Bclymer**: Con side of things.
**Bclymer**: Before you got on Brandon, I started in the field.
**Bclymer**: Never thought I would ever be doing what I'm doing today, but that's just how my career progressed.
**Bclymer**: But as hard as it is to find a good superintendent and good pm, I think it's even harder to find a good estimator.
**Bclymer**: I have had a freaking headhunter looking for senior estimated for about a year, and it's not easy.
**Speaker 2**: Nope, It's.
**Speaker 2**: It's amazing.
**Speaker 2**: It's.
**Speaker 2**: I don't know, you know, what the difference is.
**Speaker 2**: And, you know, I mean, I guess, you know, when I think about it, hell, when, you know, when we were younger in the trenches, there's plenty of people who didn't know what the hell they were doing either, so maybe it's just we see it now because we're on the.
**Speaker 2**: On the other end on the leadership side, so.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, I don't know.
**Bclymer**: All right, well, Jesse, you got my cell phone number.
**Parkerh**: I got it.
**Parkerh**: I appreciate that.
**Parkerh**: We'll keep in touch and we'll see you.
**Bclymer**: If I can just be a friend of the industry and give any advice, if I can help.
**Bclymer**: Help a little more formally, you know, whatever.
**Bclymer**: Give me a shot.
**Bclymer**: For sure.
**Speaker 2**: Appreciate it, Parker.
**Parkerh**: Yeah.
**Parkerh**: All right.
**Parkerh**: Take care.
**Bclymer**: Of.
