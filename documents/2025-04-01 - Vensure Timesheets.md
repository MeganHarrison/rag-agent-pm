**Jason.scaduto**: Make sure you take vitamin C.
**Jason.scaduto**: It helps.
**Accounting**: Yes, I know.
**Accounting**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: The thing is that I'm breastfeeding, and I know that's good.
**Jmendez**: But the thing is, I also want to be, like, you know, very cautious with it because I'm super anti.
**Jmendez**: You know, like.
**Accounting**: How do you call the, like, medicine?
**Accounting**: I know vitamin C.
**Accounting**: A lot of medicine, you know, But I'm kind of like, oh, I just want everything so natural.
**Jmendez**: I know.
**Jason.scaduto**: Then orange juice, I guess.
**Accounting**: I know exactly.
**Accounting**: That's exactly what I took this morning, so.
**Jmendez**: You're right, Rita.
**Jmendez**: Yeah.
**Jmendez**: That's what I did.
**Jason.scaduto**: How old is your daughter?
**Accounting**: She's four months.

**Jmendez**: We're waiting for our people, so.
**Jason.scaduto**: And I'm waiting for Jason, too.
**Fnjie**: It.
**Fnjie**: Hello.
**Fnjie**: Good morning.
**Kirk.davis**: Everybody.
**Fnjie**: Hi, guys.
**Accounting**: Good morning.
**Accounting**: Hi, Brianna.
**Accounting**: Hi, Jason.
**Fnjie**: How are you?
**Fnjie**: I'm good.
**Fnjie**: Pretty.
**Accounting**: Is Fatima joining?
**Fnjie**: Oh, there you go.
**Accounting**: That's the girl in media that's there.
**Fnjie**: She's.
**Accounting**: Who else are we waiting on?
**Jmendez**: Okay.
**Accounting**: Hi, Fatima.
**Accounting**: Can you hear us?
**Brianna.isenberg**: Yes, I can.
**Jmendez**: Good morning.
**Accounting**: Okay, awesome.
**Accounting**: I don't know if we're waiting for more people.
**Accounting**: Jason, do you know or.
**Kirk.davis**: I don't believe so.
**Accounting**: Okay, so I think we can go ahead and start.
**Fnjie**: Probably for sure.
**Accounting**: Okay, Fatima, so the idea of this meeting is just to understand about the time sheets.
**Accounting**: How is the process, especially for, you know, the payroll thing.
**Accounting**: So if you can open your Venture platform and just go through it.
**Jmendez**: So we, you know, like, are sure.
**Accounting**: How are we doing the timesheet?
**Accounting**: How can we add the meal allowances?
**Accounting**: How are we doing?
**Accounting**: Also, I know PTO is good in terms with Rihanna, but also, you know, mail allowances and all the stuff.
**Accounting**: Like, how do you have your timesheets and how we can reflect them on Venture.
**Fnjie**: Please.
**Fnjie**: Yeah.
**Brianna.isenberg**: Thank you, guys for organizing this meeting.
**Brianna.isenberg**: I think that's where the miscommunication Was.
**Brianna.isenberg**: I don't do anything with the timesheets.
**Fnjie**: Exactly.
**Brianna.isenberg**: So we need to source the content.
**Brianna.isenberg**: So I don't know who's getting the timesheets to Venture.
**Brianna.isenberg**: I don't know how they get into Venture.
**Accounting**: I'm not sure.
**Accounting**: Oh, Fritzi, are we ever.
**Accounting**: Nonsense.
**Accounting**: And any timesheets.
**Accounting**: Okay, so how can we start.
**Accounting**: Angela, how can we start sending you the timesheets to you?
**I-jieh.hsu**: Okay, let's start with what the timesheets are.
**I-jieh.hsu**: So are we sending physical timesheets, like handwritten timesheets, or are we doing an upload into the system?
**I-jieh.hsu**: Let's start there.
**I-jieh.hsu**: Let's start with what.
**I-jieh.hsu**: What we're needing here.
**Fnjie**: We.
**Brianna.isenberg**: We have timesheets on a spreadsheet.
**Brianna.isenberg**: They enter their time on a spreadsheet.
**Brianna.isenberg**: So how are you guys getting it now?
**Brianna.isenberg**: Do you know how it's getting into Venture?
**I-jieh.hsu**: We don't.
**Fnjie**: We don't.
**I-jieh.hsu**: We don't get it.
**I-jieh.hsu**: We don't get it.
**I-jieh.hsu**: So right now what's happening is you have set hours that are in the system.
**Fnjie**: Okay?
**I-jieh.hsu**: For everyone.
**I-jieh.hsu**: Everyone has 80 hours unless there's something different.
**I-jieh.hsu**: So what happens is, if you're needing us to do any type of manipulation, then I.
**I-jieh.hsu**: I need to have that so that we can.
**I-jieh.hsu**: We can get that entered.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**I-jieh.hsu**: And, you know, for everybody's sake, I don't think maybe that was.
**I-jieh.hsu**: That portion of the payroll maybe was not communicated as to who gets what and how it's actually getting entered.
**I-jieh.hsu**: So let's.
**I-jieh.hsu**: We got a fresh start now.
**I-jieh.hsu**: So let's just kind of take it from here and everybody can kind of be on the same page.
**Angela.thompson**: Angela, wait, can you back me up on here?
**Angela.thompson**: So are they on a time clock?
**I-jieh.hsu**: I have no idea.
**I-jieh.hsu**: I have no idea of their internal process.
**Brianna.isenberg**: No, there is no time clock.
**Brianna.isenberg**: They just.
**Brianna.isenberg**: Okay, weekly, they're 40 hours.
**Angela.thompson**: It's.
**Brianna.isenberg**: It's all project managers and the project team.
**Brianna.isenberg**: All of us.
**Brianna.isenberg**: All, you know, the rest of us are outsourced.
**Brianna.isenberg**: So our companies get paid via ap.
**Kirk.davis**: Yeah.
**Kirk.davis**: So.
**Kirk.davis**: So my understanding is this, you know, again, just to recap, I think as Angela said, you know, everybody on your staff.
**Kirk.davis**: I think it's only 11 employees right in this shelf.
**Kirk.davis**: So theoretically, it's not that much manipulation that needs to happen.
**Kirk.davis**: Everybody gets a 40 hour salary.
**Kirk.davis**: Am I correct in saying that?
**I-jieh.hsu**: 80.
**I-jieh.hsu**: I think it's 80s.
**Brianna.isenberg**: Two weeks.
**I-jieh.hsu**: Yeah, two weeks.
**Kirk.davis**: Okay.
**Kirk.davis**: Every two weeks they get 80 hours.
**Kirk.davis**: Right?
**Kirk.davis**: What needs to be manipulated, mostly.
**Kirk.davis**: And correct me if I'm wrong.
**Kirk.davis**: Very.
**Kirk.davis**: Is it Fatima or Fatima?
**Fnjie**: Fatima.
**Kirk.davis**: Okay, correct me if I'm wrong, but things like the meal sip, ins, excuse me, and PTO and all that other stuff is kind of what needs to be populated in our system.
**Kirk.davis**: Am I correct in saying that?
**Fnjie**: Yes, that is correct.
**Kirk.davis**: Okay.
**Kirk.davis**: So theoretically, this is pretty easy.
**Kirk.davis**: We could do that multitude of ways.
**Kirk.davis**: You know, preferred method.
**Kirk.davis**: It sounds like you have a timesheet that is being handled by an accounting team that you guys either outsource or use internally.
**Kirk.davis**: I don't know what your relationship there is, but if we could get a hold of that timesheet on a bi weekly basis.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Kirk.davis**: That's the simplest thing.
**Kirk.davis**: Right.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Kirk.davis**: And then depending on how it's formatted, we could either upload it, which is obviously preferred.
**Kirk.davis**: That is something we might need to manipulate if need be.
**Kirk.davis**: But we're talking about 11 employees.
**Kirk.davis**: So if it needs to be hand keyed on our end or anything like that, then we can certainly hand key that.
**Kirk.davis**: But ultimately we just need that sheet, whatever it is, Excel documents forwarded to Angela and her team so that we can enter it on a bi weekly basis.
**Kirk.davis**: And our system works in such a way that, you know, as long as it's set up correctly, everything will just fire off, you know, correctly when, when we put it in.
**Angela.thompson**: So how has it been working now for this time?
**Angela.thompson**: Like, I'm, I'm confused at all these, like, what was the issues that the me.
**Angela.thompson**: Whatever you guys said.
**Angela.thompson**: So if everyone's set up, is everyone set up for the 86.67 bi weekly automatically on the timesheet?
**Kirk.davis**: 80 bi weekly.
**Kirk.davis**: I'm just looking at the timesheet.
**Kirk.davis**: That's why we're having this call.
**Kirk.davis**: Jennifer.
**Kirk.davis**: There was a serious break in communication.
**Kirk.davis**: Right.
**Kirk.davis**: The clients, obviously Alito was frustrated because, you know, payrolls were, you know, in their mind, inaccurate.
**Kirk.davis**: And we're sitting on our side, they're saying, you know, we don't know what's inaccurate.
**Kirk.davis**: Right.
**Kirk.davis**: Like we're putting in all the information that we, we have.
**Kirk.davis**: So the reason for this call is just kind of you cut through all that.
**Kirk.davis**: But to make sure that Alito sends us all the information and hopefully, you know, have be this.
**Kirk.davis**: Be the starting point with, with their team so that we could train them up on, you know, our process, our system, all that fun stuff.
**Angela.thompson**: Okay, so right now I'm in here.
**Angela.thompson**: So Jack, Glenn and Megan all don't have 80 hours automatically, correct?
**Kirk.davis**: I don't know.
**Angela.thompson**: Yeah, I'm in here.
**Angela.thompson**: So everyone else has automatically set 80 hours.
**Accounting**: So probably because those are new employees that we set up on the venture platform.
**Accounting**: So that's exactly why they don't have it yet.
**Jmendez**: The hours set up.
**Accounting**: So Jack, it's a new employee.
**Accounting**: He just started last week on the 24th.
**Fnjie**: Sorry.
**Accounting**: And then Megan also start probably I think on the 17th if I'm not wrong.
**Accounting**: So that's why we need to set.
**Jmendez**: Them up as well.
**Angela.thompson**: Now they're.
**Angela.thompson**: They started for the first payroll, correct.
**Angela.thompson**: So their pay period.
**Angela.thompson**: So they should get a full 80 based off their hire date.
**Angela.thompson**: Like I just want to make sure that's how you guys are paying them.
**Angela.thompson**: Like, or should there be a different, like a prorated hours amount?
**Angela.thompson**: So I don't want to set them up with 80.
**Angela.thompson**: And since they're new, it would, you know, throw them off since they didn't really work that full 80.
**Angela.thompson**: If that makes sense.
**Accounting**: Yeah, it does.
**Accounting**: So I mean, for that I need to ask Brandon, but I think is there a way for us to set that up?
**Accounting**: Jennifer, is it?
**Jmendez**: Yeah.
**Angela.thompson**: No, no, no.
**Angela.thompson**: I can show you how to do that.
**Fnjie**: Yes.
**Angela.thompson**: It's just a simple click.
**Angela.thompson**: Like when you hire them, it's going to auto and then there's a little click mark that says auto timesheet, where it's going to tell you it's going to.
**Angela.thompson**: You're going to click the little box.
**Angela.thompson**: I can actually, if you want, if you're okay with me sharing my screen.
**Accounting**: Yes, of course.
**Fnjie**: Go ahead.
**Angela.thompson**: Hang on one sec.
**Angela.thompson**: Let me know when you guys can see it.
**Jmendez**: We can see it now.
**Angela.thompson**: Okay, so do you see how everyone's got 80, 80, and here's where Jack has nothing.
**Angela.thompson**: Here's where Glenn has nothing, and this is Megan that has nothing.
**Angela.thompson**: So when you guys enter the payroll, you guys don't enter it here.
**Angela.thompson**: Correct.
**Angela.thompson**: You just assume that.
**Fnjie**: No.
**Brianna.isenberg**: Yeah, we are not entering it here.
**Brianna.isenberg**: Got it?
**Brianna.isenberg**: We weren't.
**Fnjie**: Yes.
**Angela.thompson**: Okay, so if I'm going to go to employee details, I'm going to pull up Jack.
**Angela.thompson**: So let's look at Jack.
**Angela.thompson**: Jack, curtain.
**Angela.thompson**: Right.
**Angela.thompson**: So you're going to go to the pay tab over here and you're going to see where it says auto accept time sheet.
**Angela.thompson**: He's got the 80 hours.
**Angela.thompson**: We just want to move it to the timesheet.
**Angela.thompson**: So what you're going to do is just click this box and click save.
**Angela.thompson**: So then when you go into your timesheet, he should show up here.
**Angela.thompson**: I might have to refresh my screen.
**Angela.thompson**: Yeah, I'll have to refresh, but he should show here now, 80 hours on your end.
**Angela.thompson**: When we refresh the timesheet.
**Fnjie**: You have.
**I-jieh.hsu**: To put the amount of hours in now.
**Angela.thompson**: I do.
**Angela.thompson**: It won't.
**I-jieh.hsu**: Yeah.
**I-jieh.hsu**: Well, on the profile, on the next.
**I-jieh.hsu**: Just that one little extra thing.
**I-jieh.hsu**: You just.
**I-jieh.hsu**: Yeah, there you go.
**Angela.thompson**: Just put it on the next time.
**Kirk.davis**: Sheet, Jennifer, because this.
**Kirk.davis**: Everything happens when the time sheet is generated, so.
**Kirk.davis**: Right.
**Kirk.davis**: Because this one was already generated.
**Kirk.davis**: It won't just like.
**Angela.thompson**: I got it.
**Kirk.davis**: Change what's already in there.
**I-jieh.hsu**: Yeah.
**Angela.thompson**: So for now, is that.
**Angela.thompson**: Is that how it looks?
**Accounting**: Fatima?
**Accounting**: We don't have that set up on the timesheets you guys are working on.
**Accounting**: If it's 80 or not.
**Brianna.isenberg**: The timesheets we have is just an Excel.
**Brianna.isenberg**: Excel sheet that they key in the hours, the weekly hours, every week.
**Brianna.isenberg**: So every week it'll just be 40 or whatever hours they.
**Brianna.isenberg**: They work.
**Brianna.isenberg**: If they started in the.
**Brianna.isenberg**: I guess everybody would start on a Monday, usually.
**Brianna.isenberg**: So every week it'll just be the 40 hours.
**Angela.thompson**: Well, your pay period runs 323 to 4 5.
**Angela.thompson**: So that's a Sunday through.
**Kirk.davis**: Saturday.
**Angela.thompson**: Friday.
**Kirk.davis**: Miss it.
**Kirk.davis**: A Saturday there.
**Brianna.isenberg**: 3:23 to 4:5.
**Angela.thompson**: Sunday through Saturday.
**Brianna.isenberg**: Yeah.
**Brianna.isenberg**: So they work.
**Brianna.isenberg**: Yeah.
**Brianna.isenberg**: Monday through Friday.
**Angela.thompson**: Got it.
**Angela.thompson**: Got it.
**Fnjie**: Yeah.
**Kirk.davis**: So, yeah.
**Kirk.davis**: I mean, again, this is a pretty.
**Kirk.davis**: You know, I don't want to oversimplify things.
**Kirk.davis**: You know, 11 employees, pretty much all of them are salaried employees.
**Kirk.davis**: It's a pretty easy payroll that, again, the big disconnect was, you know, the alito, Maria, Fatima and her team were.
**Kirk.davis**: You know, we kept seeing timesheet, and on our end, it's like, okay, they're entering the timesheet, but we're not seeing it.
**Kirk.davis**: You know, timesheet was obviously the Excel document that they're talking about.
**Angela.thompson**: So I got you.
**Angela.thompson**: I got you.
**Angela.thompson**: So they never really did anything with our screen.
**Kirk.davis**: Correct.
**Brianna.isenberg**: Yeah.
**Kirk.davis**: And that was the confusion.
**Kirk.davis**: You know, Angela's kind of sitting there over there, pulling out her hair like there's nothing in the timesheet.
**Kirk.davis**: Right.
**Angela.thompson**: I got it, but I got it.
**Kirk.davis**: You know, we didn't know that they had their own separate team working on a timesheet.
**Kirk.davis**: So the.
**Kirk.davis**: The.
**Kirk.davis**: The options here for Maria, Fatima, anybody else on this call is.
**Kirk.davis**: I mean, again, it's a pretty easy payroll.
**Kirk.davis**: You could continue to.
**Kirk.davis**: Or you could coordinate with your accounting team and say, hey, yo, you need to send this Excel sheet to.
**Kirk.davis**: Yo.
**Kirk.davis**: Whoever on our team, Angela and her team.
**Kirk.davis**: Or we could train them up.
**Kirk.davis**: We could give them access, depending on what you guys want, we can give them access to our timesheet, and they can just enter everything directly into the Prism system.
**Kirk.davis**: They can eliminate their Excel document at that point if they needed to.
**Kirk.davis**: And you know, it's a one stop shop for you guys.
**Kirk.davis**: That's the beauty of our system.
**Accounting**: Sorry to interrupt you, Jason.
**Jmendez**: That's.
**Accounting**: I think that's exactly what if we can avoid like having multiple steps and just one step directly to payroll will be easier.
**Accounting**: So Fatima, how easy is for you guys to send the timesheet or to go to venture to Prisma platform and.
**Jmendez**: Set up the timesheet?
**Brianna.isenberg**: I would prefer to just keep using the spreadsheet because Brenda has to approve it and then once Brandon approves it, then we can send it over to Angelo's team because they have reimbursements and you know, meal stipends and all that on the, on the, on the timesheet.
**Brianna.isenberg**: So yeah, I don't want them entering it into Prism.
**Brianna.isenberg**: We will continue using the spreadsheet and just, just give us a deadline as to when you gotta have it.
**Brianna.isenberg**: I will communicate that to Brandon.
**Brianna.isenberg**: We'll make sure that he has it approved.
**Brianna.isenberg**: That will give us enough, enough time to kind of, you know, make any adjustments on our end if anything needs needs to be changed and we'll give it back to you by a certain deadline.
**Brianna.isenberg**: Just let us know when you gotta have it every week and we'll make sure you have it already approved.
**Kirk.davis**: So.
**Kirk.davis**: So typically our deadline is two days before pay date.
**Kirk.davis**: That's when we like to have payroll finalized.
**Kirk.davis**: Again, this is a pretty easy payroll and again I'm saying that, and I don't want to oversimplify it, but it really is in terms of like what we're seeing.
**Kirk.davis**: So theoretically, if your payroll.
**Kirk.davis**: Not theoretically, realistically, if your payroll is on a Friday, if you give this to us on Wednesday morning, we are very confident that we can have this done by Wednesday afternoon, probably mid morning, to be honest with you.
**Kirk.davis**: But you know that.
**Kirk.davis**: Would they approve it?
**Kirk.davis**: Oh good.
**Angela.thompson**: Do we give it back to them to approve?
**Angela.thompson**: Okay, fine.
**Angela.thompson**: They're going to send us this file.
**Angela.thompson**: Angela is going to take the take the Excel sheet import or like obviously enter it.
**Angela.thompson**: However, then are we going to give it back to them to have them review it before we even finalize?
**Angela.thompson**: Correct.
**Angela.thompson**: I got you.
**Kirk.davis**: They are using, they are using the approval in our system.
**Kirk.davis**: I thought.
**Kirk.davis**: Maria, were you the one actually approving?
**Kirk.davis**: I'm in your system right now.
**Accounting**: Yes, it's me or random, the ones that we approve.
**Accounting**: So when Angela and Martin I think send the reports, what we want to see also is, you know, like what.
**Jmendez**: Are they going to get?
**Accounting**: So that was Also the issue on this barrel.
**Accounting**: So we saw, for example, AG was saying that total pay 4,000 something.
**Accounting**: And then the next morning he texted me and he's like, I just got 27.
**Jmendez**: And I'm like, what do you mean?
**Accounting**: Like, that's not what we saw on the reports.
**Accounting**: So.
**Accounting**: And that's what I keep bugging Angela and thank you, Angela, for picking my calls for all the time, you know, answering my emails at whatever time.
**Accounting**: So I'm all the time asking Angela, like.
**Accounting**: And I ask her, like, is this what they're going to get?
**Accounting**: So that was the issue as well.
**Accounting**: So we want to make sure if the reports can actually also mention this is what they're gonna get.
**Accounting**: That's what we need just to see.
**Jmendez**: Okay.
**Accounting**: Because it's easier for us as well to go and approve it and make sure that they are receiving their regular earnings, you know, and if something has changed, well, we need to know what happened, for example, with the bonus with Jesse.
**Accounting**: If Angela didn't explain it to me, I was like, well, hold on, I'm not going to prove anything because it's too much.
**Accounting**: So Angela took the time to explain it to me to make sense.
**Accounting**: So that's what we need, you know, for sure.
**I-jieh.hsu**: And Maria, just to be.
**I-jieh.hsu**: Just to be clear, you're not able to go online to approve.
**I-jieh.hsu**: I think that I am.
**I-jieh.hsu**: Think.
**I-jieh.hsu**: Oh, you are.
**I-jieh.hsu**: Okay.
**Accounting**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: So I can go to the Prisma platform and then go to.
**I-jieh.hsu**: Okay, I wanted to make sure.
**Accounting**: And then flag it, you know, like grab it and then.
**Accounting**: Yeah, so once I grab it, I'll.
**Jmendez**: Check it out and then.
**I-jieh.hsu**: Yeah, perfect.
**Kirk.davis**: So.
**Kirk.davis**: So, Maria, this brings up a good conversation and I think we're going to, you know, continue these conversations because there's obviously a learning opportunity here for everybody.
**Kirk.davis**: I know that you had mentioned that you.
**Kirk.davis**: Well, one of the things Brandon said in our call yesterday is that there's a lot of back and forth.
**Kirk.davis**: Right.
**Kirk.davis**: And that's certainly the truth given the situation that we have right now.
**Kirk.davis**: I know that Angela and her team are sending you the reporting.
**Kirk.davis**: You know, we go in, we calculate, we do all the stuff on our side so that it looks like, hey, your reports are ready for you.
**Kirk.davis**: Within our system, that's actually something you could do, you know, immediately, right off the bat, even before you're about to finalize the payroll.
**Kirk.davis**: And I'm going to share my screen real quick because it's.
**Accounting**: Okay, Go ahead.
**Fnjie**: Thank you.
**Kirk.davis**: Yeah, so this is your shell.
**Kirk.davis**: It's going to look a little different from.
**Kirk.davis**: For you Because I'm obviously on the service provider side of things.
**Kirk.davis**: But if you go into something here called I know when you go into your payroll approval, this screen should look familiar to you.
**Kirk.davis**: Typically when there's a payroll about to be run, and I don't know why there's not one in there, but when there's a payroll about to be run, you'll see like all the information here.
**Kirk.davis**: And then there's also going to be a drop down here with all the reports.
**Accounting**: Those reports, each employee, right?
**Kirk.davis**: You could get it for each employee.
**Kirk.davis**: You could get your payroll register, you could get your check journal, you could get your invoice, your potential invoice within there.
**Kirk.davis**: There's, I think 12 different reports that you could pull within there.
**Kirk.davis**: And those are the exact same reports that we have on our side that we're literally just saving as a PDF and sending to you.
**Kirk.davis**: So to eliminate that back and forth, you know, as you're going into your payroll approval, you could just pull those reports yourself, right?
**Kirk.davis**: And I don't know if that's something that you want.
**Kirk.davis**: You could convert them into PDF, etc.
**Kirk.davis**: Kind of thinks that there's not a payroll in here.
**Kirk.davis**: That I could say, oh, probably because it's not calculated, right?
**Kirk.davis**: Payroll.
**Kirk.davis**: What is it?
**Kirk.davis**: I could spell.
**Kirk.davis**: That'd be awesome.
**Kirk.davis**: Calculate payroll.
**Kirk.davis**: Is it process payroll?
**Kirk.davis**: Sorry, I'm out of the day to day a lot with this kind of stuff.
**Kirk.davis**: Process payroll.
**Kirk.davis**: This is a similar screen.
**Kirk.davis**: This is what we see on our end.
**Kirk.davis**: Again, it's a similar screen.
**Kirk.davis**: I'm just pulling this up so you can see like all the reports that you're going to have here.
**Kirk.davis**: You have your payroll summary.
**Kirk.davis**: And again, this is just a view.
**Kirk.davis**: So if you wanted to see your payroll summary, it would all be in here.
**Kirk.davis**: There's nothing to summarize right now.
**Kirk.davis**: Employees and payroll and then your review.
**Kirk.davis**: This is all the reports that you're going to have access to.
**Angela.thompson**: The best one, if you want to go for, you could do a payroll voucher if you want to look individually.
**Angela.thompson**: But I always tell everyone, like my favorite is the gross to net.
**Angela.thompson**: That's going to show you exactly what's going to be listed on the check.
**Angela.thompson**: It's going to show you deductions, it's going to show you everything, what that employee is going to get on their voucher.
**Angela.thompson**: That's one of my favorite ones to run.
**Brianna.isenberg**: Okay.
**Jmendez**: So to be honest with you, so.
**Accounting**: I receive a lot of emails and.
**Jmendez**: When Angela send me an email, I always check it out because I know it's related to payroll.
**Accounting**: So if we can.
**Jmendez**: I know there's a notification from the PRISMA platform saying payroll is ready for approved.
**Jmendez**: So sometimes when I go there, it says payroll is not pending or something like that.
**Accounting**: So I'm not sure if it's something.
**Jmendez**: From the system or if.
**Accounting**: I mean, because the moment I get.
**Jmendez**: A notification, I immediately go to the platform and I think I sent a screenshot to Angela.
**Jmendez**: It says payroll is not pending or something.
**Jmendez**: I think they were working on it.
**Jmendez**: So I'm not sure exactly which one should I pay attention to.
**Jmendez**: Like, which will be the alarm, you.
**Fnjie**: Know, for the notification.
**Kirk.davis**: That could happen.
**Kirk.davis**: That could.
**Kirk.davis**: I mean, that that email is certainly your alarm to go in and look what I'm going to guess is happening.
**Kirk.davis**: And I'm not, you know, part of the process here, but what I'm going to guess is happening is somebody calculated it and said, oh, shoot, I forgot to do something, right, and then probably pulled the payroll back and then needed to recalculate it.
**Kirk.davis**: So if you're going in pretty quickly, there's.
**Kirk.davis**: There's a chance that somebody said, oh, you know, I forgot to put in this stipend, or, you know, I forgot to put in, you know, the salary for this in person.
**Kirk.davis**: So if you went in and you saw that it was pending, you know, that certainly is possible, but we'll work on our end to ensure that we're not calculating unless we're 100% sure that it's, you know, fully, you know, populated.
**Kirk.davis**: So that going forward, once you get that email, that is your indicator to go in, pull the reports, do what you need to do to approve, and we'll go from there.
**Accounting**: Okay, sounds good.
**Accounting**: So I.
**Accounting**: I don't have a problem.
**Jmendez**: With the notification, to be honest.
**Jmendez**: The moment I see it, immediately I go to Prisma to make sure.
**Accounting**: So if anything, we can leave it.
**Jmendez**: Like that, Angela, so you don't have like, you know, double steps to just send me again the reports and everything.
**Jmendez**: And if I see anything I don't understand something that I need explanation for or anything, I will bother you, as always, just to make sure everybody's receiving what, you know, what they need.
**Jmendez**: So I will do that.
**Accounting**: So that's okay.
**Jmendez**: You can eliminate that step.
**Jmendez**: And then, so just to recap, some of the things that we need to do is just Accounting needs to send you the timesheets every two weeks, right, for the payment.
**Accounting**: So, Fatima, can we make sure that.
**Jmendez**: I'm also succeeded on that?
**Jmendez**: Angela, too?
**Jmendez**: I don't know, Jason.
**Jmendez**: If you want to be part of it or just.
**Jmendez**: What, with Angela?
**Kirk.davis**: No, Angela would be fine.
**Kirk.davis**: Okay, perfect.
**Kirk.davis**: I don't know if you.
**Fnjie**: So she.
**Kirk.davis**: Excuse me.
**Kirk.davis**: Anytime I get on a call, I get hoarse.
**Kirk.davis**: I apologize.
**Jmendez**: It's okay.
**Kirk.davis**: For the time being, can you also include Rita on those emails?
**Fnjie**: Of course.
**Kirk.davis**: Not that we don't have full confidence in Angela, just in case Angela's out or whatever, you know, she'll be able to kind of direct.
**Fnjie**: Sounds good.
**Jmendez**: Okay, so we'll copy Rita.
**Jmendez**: And then I think we were talking also.
**Jmendez**: Yeah, so that's on the payroll side.
**Jmendez**: I think we're covered on that side.
**Jmendez**: Just timesheets.
**Jmendez**: And then I'll just go ahead ahead and make sure everything is fine with the notification email.
**Accounting**: Now, I know we were talking also.
**Jmendez**: Yesterday to have some weekly meetings or monthly meetings related to, you know, venture in general.
**Jmendez**: So I don't know if that's with Rihanna.
**Accounting**: I suppose that's why she's here.
**Jmendez**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: So I don't know if you want.
**Jmendez**: To set up and Rihanna, you can.
**Angela.thompson**: Put me on there too.
**Ed.ballinger**: Okay.
**Ed.ballinger**: Yeah, we can schedule some time.
**Ed.ballinger**: We can go over, you know, maybe pulling different reports or just more system training or any other, you know, things that come up day to day that we could kind of work through and discuss.
**Ed.ballinger**: And we can start weekly if that's what you want to do, and then taper to monthly if.
**Ed.ballinger**: If we need to, or just whatever you think you need, I'm available and I'm here to support you guys.
**Angela.thompson**: We also have training too.
**Angela.thompson**: Brianna can send you.
**Angela.thompson**: We have training client training videos.
**Angela.thompson**: So this way, like, if you ever want to just watch some of those before our call or whatever, get a handle of, you know, maybe that'll help too, because I know they're pretty.
**Angela.thompson**: They're pretty easy flow type of videos clients can utilize and watch on how things are processed or where to go to get reports, things like that.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Jmendez**: Okay.
**Accounting**: So Brianna, if you want next payroll is when?
**Accounting**: Sorry, not this.
**Accounting**: The next Friday.
**Angela.thompson**: Right, the 14th.
**Angela.thompson**: Let me see.
**Accounting**: 11Th.
**Accounting**: So Brianna, can we set it up probably on that week, next week, just.
**Jmendez**: To make sure we have everything running before sending everything to Angela and make.
**Accounting**: Sure we have that and then from.
**Jmendez**: There we'll see, you know, sometimes maybe in the meeting we don't have.
**Jmendez**: We have only one question to question.
**Jmendez**: So I think we can do it monthly since then or bi weekly.
**Accounting**: So if you can send a meeting.
**Jmendez**: You can also invite Fatima and also accounting team.
**Jmendez**: So everybody you know is on the same page.
**Jmendez**: And we're making sure everything is set up.
**Jmendez**: So that'll be.
**Jmendez**: I think that's it, to be honest.
**Ed.ballinger**: Okay.
**Ed.ballinger**: Did you want to schedule the meeting for that Friday or the day before?
**Accounting**: I can schedule.
**Jmendez**: It's okay.
**Accounting**: I can schedule it.
**Jmendez**: I will also send Brandon's, you know, email so he can be there as well.
**Jmendez**: I'm sure he will have questions too, so I'll set it up for us.
**Jmendez**: Okay?
**Ed.ballinger**: Okay, sounds good.
**Accounting**: Okay, perfect.
**Accounting**: Jason, are we missing something else from yesterday or.
**Fnjie**: I think we're covered.
**Kirk.davis**: No, I did do.
**Kirk.davis**: I was able to research a couple of the concerns obviously Brandon had.
**Kirk.davis**: Okay.
**Kirk.davis**: And I will be sending a recap email of my conversation with my team internally just to kind of explain a few of the things, the nuances that I know that you know don't really mean.
**Kirk.davis**: Like the reasoning behind it doesn't really matter to you.
**Kirk.davis**: I mean, you guys just obviously want this to be, you know, a smooth process going forward and we certainly commit to that.
**Kirk.davis**: But just so you kind of have the full disclosure of what happens, particularly in the HSA and.
**Kirk.davis**: Okay, perfect.
**Kirk.davis**: We'll send that.
**Kirk.davis**: I'll send that over.
**Accounting**: Don't worry.
**Accounting**: Thank you, Jason, for sending that.
**Fnjie**: Actually, that's good.
**Jmendez**: So we can have.
**Jmendez**: Also, everybody's in the same page.
**Jmendez**: That's important.
**Kirk.davis**: Yep, exactly.
**Accounting**: Okay, perfect.
**Accounting**: So, guys, thank you so much for that.
**Accounting**: I'm going to set up the meeting with you, Brianna, and then Angela, thank you so much for your help.
**Accounting**: I know you're always available and I'll keep bothering you if anything.
**Accounting**: Okay, thank you, Jennifer.
**Accounting**: Thank you, Rita.
**Accounting**: I'll make sure.
**Accounting**: I'm going to CC you on the.
**Accounting**: In the emails with Angela.
**Accounting**: And thank you, Jason, for also, you know, be part of this.
**Kirk.davis**: Of course.
**Kirk.davis**: Thank you.
