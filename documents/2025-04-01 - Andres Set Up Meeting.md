**Adelgado**: Hi guys.
**Adelgado**: Good morning.
**Bclymer**: Morning.
**Bclymer**: Maria, can you hear me?
**Adelgado**: Sorry, I'm a little bit sick.
**Adelgado**: So that's why you won't see me.
**Adelgado**: But welcome Andres to a little group.
**Adelgado**: Yes, I have set up, I have set up everything with you related to your bluebeam account and everything.
**Adelgado**: So you should be able to go to.
**Adelgado**: And I know you mentioned that you need.
**Adelgado**: You don't have CAD in your computer in your laptop.
**Adelgado**: So, so we are just going to.
**Adelgado**: So we're gonna.
**Adelgado**: We need to share a Brandon's login access JSC to Andre.
**Adelgado**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Now does Andre have a Alito email?
**Adelgado**: Everything is already set up already.
**Adelgado**: I think you.
**Adelgado**: Are you still able to use that one already, the little one?
**Mcalcetero**: Yes, I have set up my email.
**Adelgado**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: I didn't have any like the email he was responding to.
**Bclymer**: That's the one I put on the meeting invite just because I didn't, I didn't know if that was set up.
**Bclymer**: So from now on I'll start doing that.
**Bclymer**: So we have.
**Adelgado**: Yeah, so that's set up.
**Adelgado**: And then Jesse, let me know if you guys need anything else in terms of setting up everything.
**Adelgado**: I know you want to go with Andre to, you know, talk about everything that he needs to do.
**Adelgado**: So just let me know, I'm here.
**Adelgado**: Just I'm going to leave you two guys to go ahead and then if you need me to jump back back to the call, just let me know.
**Bclymer**: Okay, Maria, when you say set up.
**Bclymer**: So Andreas, you already, you.
**Bclymer**: You're able to access our job files like the estimating folder?
**Adelgado**: Yeah.
**Adelgado**: So he should be able to get everything since he already downloaded the his account and he has access to teams and everything.
**Adelgado**: So the only thing that he needs to go to do is just use OneDrive connected to, you know, his Microsoft account.
**Adelgado**: He can do it online.
**Adelgado**: That's the way I do it.
**Adelgado**: Or if you can do it like if you want to download it locally to your computer.
**Adelgado**: But that's up to you to be honest.
**Adelgado**: So you just need to go to your Microsoft and then go to OneDrive and then just check all the folders that we have there.
**Bclymer**: Okay, Maria, if you don't mind, I had to cut the meeting short with, with Ken, but can you teams call him?
**Bclymer**: So we're on a teams meeting.
**Speaker 3**: So Ken finish.
**Adelgado**: Ken.
**Adelgado**: Ken Sent me a message yesterday.
**Adelgado**: He was already connected to teams right now.
**Bclymer**: We had our meeting this morning, but I didn't get to go through Notion or set up his blue beam.
**Adelgado**: If you could set up, but I can.
**Adelgado**: His blue beam is already set up for Maria.
**Speaker 3**: He's saying just walking through and make sure it's working on everything.
**Adelgado**: Sure, but.
**Adelgado**: So do you want me to.
**Adelgado**: Do you want me to go to the Bluebeam account or what are you going to do, Jesse?
**Speaker 3**: So what?
**Speaker 3**: So call, call Ken, do a screen share, walk through, make sure he can open his notion and show him how it works.
**Speaker 3**: Walk through, make sure you open up his Bluebeam, make sure it works, walk through everything and make sure it all.
**Adelgado**: Works okay with Ken.
**Adelgado**: Okay, so I'm gonna set up a time with him to do that.
**Bclymer**: That's fine.
**Bclymer**: He should be available now.
**Bclymer**: I just got off the call with him.
**Adelgado**: Okay, so let me then call him and then just go ahead and do that with him.
**Adelgado**: And again, if you guys need me to set up something else, just let me know and then I will set up for Andres as well.
**Speaker 3**: Okay, so one thing here.
**Speaker 3**: Andres, are you like.
**Speaker 3**: So Maria, you.
**Speaker 3**: You're able to call the States and everything?
**Speaker 3**: Andres, are you able to do that?
**Mcalcetero**: Yes, I will, I will do it.
**Speaker 3**: You're able to make calls?
**Mcalcetero**: Yes.
**Speaker 3**: Okay, good.
**Bclymer**: People can call you on the same number.
**Bclymer**: It's like a.
**Bclymer**: A U.S.
**Bclymer**: number.
**Mcalcetero**: I have a Mexican number, but I could be receive calls, whatever.
**Speaker 3**: Maria, how does that work with you?
**Adelgado**: So the thing is that I have an international phone number with AT&T and I kept it when I was in United States.
**Adelgado**: So I kept my phone, my personal phone with the international number.
**Adelgado**: So that's how it worked because I have an AT&T account and I'm using it through Colombia.
**Adelgado**: So that's what I have in America.
**Adelgado**: American number.
**Speaker 3**: So how do we do that for Andres?
**Adelgado**: So not sure if we.
**Adelgado**: I mean, I remember my dad wanted to do it too.
**Adelgado**: I think we can actually set up.
**Adelgado**: I.
**Adelgado**: Let me try to find a provider numbers international because I know there are some of them that they can give you an international number and then you can have it, you can add it, you know, to your phone.
**Adelgado**: Okay, perfect.
**Adelgado**: So we can try to check.
**Adelgado**: Let me try to find that.
**Adelgado**: I don't think AT and T does it because I know my dad wants to do that too and they didn't want it like to do it since outside, but.
**Adelgado**: But I'll check.
**Adelgado**: I know there are some providers for that.
**Speaker 3**: Okay, so like do we need to add like a line to the company, Verizon plan or so we can do that.
**Adelgado**: We can add a line, an international line, and then what we can do is just set up that line to Andres.
**Adelgado**: So actually, if you want me, I can contact Verizon and just ask them how we can do that, just to have an international line for, for Andres and maybe for Jose as well.
**Adelgado**: Because I don't, I don't know if he already has an international number.
**Speaker 3**: Jose doesn't need a phone number.
**Speaker 3**: He'll.
**Speaker 3**: He'll handle like Fritz and everybody else.
**Speaker 3**: Like, he's not going to get direct calls like Andre's.
**Speaker 3**: Well, the thing is with Andres is he's going to be talking to subcontractors and everything, so people need to call him like it's a us number.
**Adelgado**: Exactly.
**Adelgado**: So let me go ahead.
**Adelgado**: I'll check with Verizon if they can add a line, international line to it and how much it'll cost and how to set it up.
**Adelgado**: Okay.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: How much do you pay for your.
**Speaker 3**: Your.
**Speaker 3**: Because like, I text you.
**Adelgado**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: And like, it's like it's normal.
**Speaker 3**: Like, how, how much do you pay for that?
**Adelgado**: So I paid $80 for that monthly.
**Speaker 3**: So I imagine we, I guess, somehow could do the same for.
**Speaker 3**: Because, I mean, when I call.
**Speaker 3**: Rings normal.
**Adelgado**: Yes.
**Adelgado**: Correct.
**Adelgado**: Yeah, you call me and then they call you or we text via the SMS and everything.
**Adelgado**: So.
**Adelgado**: Yeah, I can ask Verison.
**Adelgado**: To be honest, I just kept my number from at&t.
**Adelgado**: So.
**Speaker 3**: Okay.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, maybe.
**Speaker 3**: I don't know if voiceover IP is, is better or like, you know, what, what the best way is.
**Adelgado**: Actually, actually there's also like, something that we can do online, but I'll check the providers and I'll share them with you.
**Adelgado**: I'm sure there are, like, different ones, not only like Verizon or AT&T.
**Bclymer**: So, Andres, are you on the same eastern time zone as us?
**Bclymer**: Is it 8:22 there?
**Mcalcetero**: Series 6:22.
**Mcalcetero**: 6:22.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Speaker 3**: Is Mountain time.
**Mcalcetero**: Yes, and I'm fine with that.
**Speaker 3**: Do you, do you have Verizon or who.
**Speaker 3**: Do you have?
**Speaker 3**: Who's your phone carrier down there here?
**Mcalcetero**: AT&T.
**Speaker 3**: Do they have Verizon down?
**Adelgado**: I think AT&T can set it up as well from Mexico.
**Adelgado**: I think so.
**Adelgado**: I don't think it's going to be a problem.
**Adelgado**: We can check.
**Adelgado**: Let me just check.
**Speaker 3**: All right.
**Speaker 3**: Maria?
**Speaker 3**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: Figure that out, please.
**Adelgado**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Andre, are you able to share your screen with us so we can see what you got set up so far?
**Bclymer**: Should be up in the top right corner.
**Bclymer**: There's a share button.
**Bclymer**: And then you just select which screen.
**Bclymer**: If you have multiple screens, you want to share.
**Speaker 3**: It out.
**Bclymer**: There you go.
**Speaker 3**: Do you have two monitors?
**Speaker 3**: Just scoot that to the side.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so then when you log into your Microsoft 365, what does that look like?
**Mcalcetero**: Okay, well, here, the email and I got.
**Bclymer**: I'm trying to see how you get to the one drive.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay.
**Speaker 3**: Oh, you're on a Mac.
**Mcalcetero**: Yes, I will need to.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay, thank you.
**Mcalcetero**: Thank you.
**Bclymer**: So, and if you go into the web browser on the Mac, does it.
**Speaker 3**: Well, you'd have to use probably Google, I think.
**Speaker 3**: How do you use Safari?
**Speaker 3**: It's.
**Bclymer**: And you got your login from Maria for your Microsoft.
**Speaker 3**: Can you read English?
**Mcalcetero**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: So are you logged in to your Alito?
**Mcalcetero**: Exactly.
**Bclymer**: And then maybe we have to share.
**Bclymer**: We have to share these folders with him, Brandon.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: Well, Maria, didn't you already get that set up?
**Adelgado**: Wait, but I did.
**Adelgado**: I did.
**Adelgado**: I mean, once he uses his OneDrive, he should be able to access it.
**Speaker 3**: Well, you gotta.
**Speaker 3**: Did you ask.
**Speaker 3**: You have to ask him.
**Speaker 3**: You have to add him as a person.
**Speaker 3**: Here, I'll do it real quick.
**Adelgado**: Yeah, on one drive.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Adelgado**: Well, let me check.
**Adelgado**: Okay, one second.
**Speaker 3**: Well, no, I mean, you have to add them to the folders.
**Adelgado**: Oh.
**Bclymer**: So I just can.
**Bclymer**: This morning I shared the 2025, the 2024, and then the estimated folders, and then he was able to.
**Bclymer**: They would come up on his files.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, they're there.
**Speaker 3**: What's.
**Speaker 3**: What's your.
**Speaker 3**: What's your email Ad.
**Speaker 3**: What?
**Bclymer**: Adelgado.
**Bclymer**: There it is.
**Bclymer**: Boom.
**Speaker 3**: There you go.
**Speaker 3**: He needs Jesse estimating and then all the job folders, right?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I think just 24, 25 and estimating.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Speaker 3**: All right.
**Speaker 3**: So if you go in.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, there you go.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: There we go.
**Speaker 3**: Maria, I'm removing Dylan from all these because she's still on there for some reason.
**Adelgado**: Wait, on one, right?
**Adelgado**: Yeah, I'll check it out because I deleted yesterday from those, but I'll check.
**Adelgado**: And also from Beam.
**Adelgado**: So.
**Adelgado**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So if you go in that folder, Andres, and you scroll down, you know, these are go.
**Bclymer**: Like when we get a job that an owner approaches us on, we create a folder in here.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: From a template, like all the way the top.
**Bclymer**: If you click in administrative and you open on that, and then the folder template.
**Bclymer**: If you open that folder up, number four.
**Bclymer**: Like, we'll take this and we'll just click and copy that, and then we'll make a folder in the main one, you don't have to do that.
**Bclymer**: And then we, Then we.
**Bclymer**: Well, you don't need to do that right now, but.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: If you go back to the estimating the main folder for estimating.
**Bclymer**: So these jobs, like the first ones, like this Goodwill Sloan Reroof, that's one we'd like you to work on today.
**Bclymer**: It's a.
**Bclymer**: If you open up that folder.
**Bclymer**: We've only got one.
**Bclymer**: No, the 25 0325.
**Bclymer**: It's called goodwill Sloan Reroof.
**Bclymer**: It's a pretty simple job here.
**Bclymer**: They just want us.
**Bclymer**: It's a project we completed last year and the building they're in, they want to put a new roof over their area.
**Bclymer**: So in these folders, like mostly it's the drawings.
**Bclymer**: Specifications are typically nothing that we ever get.
**Bclymer**: But this job, you know, there's no drawings.
**Bclymer**: It's just a building.
**Bclymer**: We know where it is.
**Bclymer**: But if you look, you know, permits, it doesn't really apply to you.
**Bclymer**: Estimate is something we'll go over that you fill out.
**Bclymer**: Once we get pricing, the proposal is what we send to the owner.
**Bclymer**: Once we've compiled the pricing and those things we.
**Bclymer**: There's nothing in there currently.
**Bclymer**: Bid response is where we save.
**Bclymer**: If you open the bid response folder number six.
**Bclymer**: So this is where seven thermal and moisture protection.
**Bclymer**: That's.
**Bclymer**: It's just a re roof job.
**Bclymer**: So if you open that folder, we'll see if Andrew saved the quote in there.
**Bclymer**: And Andrew is a project engineer who helps with estimating for us to open up folder seven.
**Bclymer**: So that's a quote we received.
**Bclymer**: It's a bit of a roof currently.
**Bclymer**: And they want, you know, this particular roofer only does TPO roofing.
**Bclymer**: So they gave us a price.
**Bclymer**: If you scroll down and they actually added a drawing, I believe it should be attached to this.
**Bclymer**: Is there only two pages here?
**Mcalcetero**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Okay, let me find.
**Bclymer**: Forward you an email.
**Bclymer**: Put your email one more time.
**Bclymer**: Yes, There we go.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: So I just sent you an email where he's.
**Bclymer**: He put in an aerial of the, the area roof we're talking about.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So they're.
**Bclymer**: They occupy that portion of the building.
**Bclymer**: And so this roof has little mini parapet walls that run across it.
**Bclymer**: So you're able to stop and start, you know, the TPO roof.
**Bclymer**: And then on the other side of that little parapet wall, it's going to be the Bitumas roof.
**Bclymer**: And then they just split the two at the cap.
**Bclymer**: But the problem is there's one small area.
**Bclymer**: Go back to that picture that he's calling an alternative.
**Bclymer**: That one there.
**Bclymer**: There's no wall to stop and start, so you can't just put TPO there.
**Bclymer**: You would have to, you know, his alternate is to build a curb in that spot and then split the roof off there.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So if you look at his proposal and you can save.
**Bclymer**: I would save this aerial.
**Bclymer**: You know, you can save it to your computer, convert it to a PDF and then save it in the folder.
**Bclymer**: You can save it as a picture in there, just as more documents to back up the alternate.
**Bclymer**: So what we need to do is you get on Building Connected, find some more roofing subs, and I will bring our.
**Bclymer**: Our subcontractor, like directory.
**Bclymer**: Like, have we set that up really?
**Bclymer**: Or do we access a list of all the subs we used in the past?
**Speaker 3**: No, I mean, I, I don't have a directory or anything.
**Speaker 3**: It's, it's.
**Speaker 3**: I mean, if anything, I'd go into, you know, past jobs on Building Connected or whatever.
**Speaker 3**: I.
**Speaker 3**: I don't know how we would necessarily set that up.
**Speaker 3**: Maybe that's something Andres can figure out.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Andreas, you could, you know, we can give you access to like, all the job folders and you can go through and just go to the estimate folder, you know, and we've updated a lot in the last year where we're trying to, you know, be more specific, putting proposals by trade in that folder and then you can look and see.
**Bclymer**: But in this case, by Building Connected would be the best way to go is, you know, go to Indianapolis Market and look for roofers that.
**Bclymer**: Okay, that can do it.
**Bclymer**: And you know, the, the scope of work.
**Bclymer**: Like, you can look at his quote, his quote, you know, you know, he's got to go around each of the existing rooftop units.
**Bclymer**: He's gonna, you know, roof over.
**Bclymer**: You know, they had some rooftop units on there that were removed at some point.
**Bclymer**: So there's just a box that's a leak.
**Bclymer**: So they're removing anything that's unused.
**Bclymer**: They're reflashing to all the existing pipe stands.
**Bclymer**: We need to make sure that they provide an option to actually lift up the rtus and bring the roofing over.
**Bclymer**: I think he was just pricing it as counter flashing at the curbs.
**Bclymer**: So all those things that, you know, you think of when you re roof a building, you know, those are the things that.
**Bclymer**: And we started to.
**Bclymer**: When we do our estimates.
**Bclymer**: And I'll pull one up here to.
**Bclymer**: If you go into the estimating folder, go back to the, the overall folder.
**Bclymer**: One more that if you click up if you go up to the.
**Bclymer**: It says alita group estimating 2503.
**Bclymer**: If you just click on the estimating, it'll take you to the.
**Bclymer**: Go over to the left a little bit.
**Bclymer**: Click on that one.
**Bclymer**: So if you scroll down.
**Bclymer**: So this is another project we'll have you working on.
**Bclymer**: We're waiting on some More information, but 25 0313.
**Bclymer**: Goodwill Foundations.
**Bclymer**: See that folder?
**Bclymer**: Open that up.
**Bclymer**: And if you go into estimate number four.
**Bclymer**: And then you go goodwill Foundations, estimate.
**Bclymer**: Let's see.
**Bclymer**: So these are scope sheets.
**Bclymer**: So I just talked with Andrew and we basically, we write down all the things for each trade.
**Bclymer**: This one's for abatement.
**Bclymer**: I think Glenn went in and updated and added this yesterday.
**Bclymer**: But there's demo, there's abatement metals.
**Bclymer**: Like, okay, all of these.
**Bclymer**: All of these tabs were basically writing the work.
**Bclymer**: We want that sub to bid.
**Bclymer**: And then basically they'll return this.
**Bclymer**: You just email this to them.
**Bclymer**: And then they re.
**Bclymer**: When they return this particular sheet, they can put if they have it or not.
**Bclymer**: And then they may not price everything individually, but you'll get an outdoor.
**Bclymer**: You know, they'll give you their number.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: You know, and in this particular job, if you go to.
**Bclymer**: And that's something that we're looking, like, for you to help us with.
**Bclymer**: If you go back to the folder, like for this job, the Goodwill Foundations.
**Bclymer**: Well, don't open the attachment.
**Bclymer**: If you go back to the Goodwill, like up in the.
**Bclymer**: Right there.
**Speaker 3**: Jesse, do you need me for anything else?
**Speaker 3**: I gotta get ready for this next meeting.
**Bclymer**: I think we're good.
**Speaker 3**: All right, Andres, Maria is going to get you the whole number things set up.
**Speaker 3**: Nice to meet you.
**Mcalcetero**: Nice to meet you.
**Speaker 3**: On teams.
**Speaker 3**: Jesse's said great things about you, so looking forward to it.
**Mcalcetero**: Perfect.
**Mcalcetero**: Thank you very much.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Mcalcetero**: See it?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: Let me know if you need anything.
**Adelgado**: I'm just going to go ahead and call Ken just to make sure he has everything set up.
**Adelgado**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: Thank you.
**Adelgado**: Thank you, Jesse.
**Adelgado**: Welcome.
**Mcalcetero**: Bye.
**Adelgado**: Bye.
**Mcalcetero**: Thank you.
**Mcalcetero**: Bye.
**Bclymer**: So if you go to the drawing folder here, Andres.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay.
**Mcalcetero**: Drawing.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Like, some of these.
**Bclymer**: On certain jobs, because we go through so many revisions as we go through the design process, because we.
**Bclymer**: Almost all of our jobs, we hire the architects and engineers or we have our, you know, subcontractors, like the electrician, a lot of times will do their own design.
**Bclymer**: That's for permit.
**Bclymer**: So but in these drawings, you know, and every time I get a drawing update, I will label it with the date received just so I Know what's the latest.
**Bclymer**: So you see here the.
**Bclymer**: The 2503, 28.
**Bclymer**: That's the latest drawing we have for this.
**Bclymer**: So if you open that.
**Bclymer**: If you open that drawing up and this started, you know, I went to the site, they had a sales brochure basically from.
**Bclymer**: From the leasing company.
**Bclymer**: And I just took that and I marked it up.
**Bclymer**: So maybe like Matt might be the first thing we look at.
**Bclymer**: But this drawing was created by an architect that works for us, you know, just remotely.
**Bclymer**: And then they drew this up from what I had made as comments.
**Bclymer**: So if you go back to the folder now, if you can open this in a separate screen so you can go back to it.
**Mcalcetero**: This one?
**Bclymer**: Well, if you go.
**Bclymer**: I guess it's DD drawings.
**Bclymer**: Okay, go to that folder.
**Bclymer**: See, see here.
**Mcalcetero**: This is the last one.
**Mcalcetero**: Now, well, the foundations.
**Bclymer**: Glenn changed this drawing around a little bit.
**Bclymer**: Let me look online here.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay.
**Mcalcetero**: Yesterday I tried to use Bluebeam and do you know how to.
**Mcalcetero**: How could I use it on Mac or.
**Mcalcetero**: I will need to buy a new computer.
**Bclymer**: No, this is your Blue Beam I'm seeing.
**Bclymer**: Well, let's see.
**Bclymer**: What does Blue Beam look like when you open it up?
**Mcalcetero**: Well, it's just.
**Bclymer**: You have to get an app to view it.
**Mcalcetero**: Nope, I just.
**Bclymer**: Because you should be.
**Bclymer**: We paid for a Bluebeam account for you.
**Bclymer**: That Maria, I thought she set that up for you.
**Mcalcetero**: Yes, she.
**Bclymer**: So if you log.
**Bclymer**: If you go back to that screen where it says log in.
**Mcalcetero**: Uhhuh.
**Bclymer**: You click on go.
**Bclymer**: No, go to log.
**Bclymer**: Oh.
**Bclymer**: It gives you these options.
**Bclymer**: Let's see Cloud.
**Bclymer**: See if.
**Mcalcetero**: So I could see the projects here.
**Mcalcetero**: No, I don't know.
**Bclymer**: Well, one drive.
**Mcalcetero**: Well, I just need to add all the.
**Bclymer**: So when you click on those files, they won't open.
**Bclymer**: If you click on that PDF document in there.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Does it not open up?
**Bclymer**: Well, not in here, but here.
**Bclymer**: If you double click one of those.
**Bclymer**: Go down and double click one of those.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So this was just a markup of the drawing that we had done to change a few things.
**Bclymer**: But it doesn't let you edit.
**Mcalcetero**: I need access to this edit.
**Bclymer**: So you have Bluebeam on your.
**Bclymer**: Com or it doesn't download your computer because it's Apple.
**Mcalcetero**: I think I need to have.
**Mcalcetero**: Well, the software is review.
**Mcalcetero**: No, but I can't download it.
**Mcalcetero**: But I will investigate how to.
**Mcalcetero**: How could I download just Blue Beam?
**Mcalcetero**: But it's now or write app.
