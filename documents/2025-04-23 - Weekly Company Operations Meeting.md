## Transcript
**Bclymer**: Hi, guys.
**Jdawson**: Hi.
**Bclymer**: I think it's just me saying Jesse and I think Brandon is not joining today either because he's in another meeting.
**Bclymer**: So I think we're waiting on Jesse.
**Bclymer**: Only Nick as well.
**Bclymer**: There it is.
**Bclymer**: And that's it.
**Ataylor**: Since 1230.
**Njepson**: That's vitamin D, dude.
**Njepson**: That's what the sun is though.
**Bclymer**: Okay, guys, are we ready?
**Bclymer**: I think it's missing Nick, but we can start the meeting so we're not behind.
**Bclymer**: So Jesse, Uniqlo, how was the meeting today?
**Jdawson**: It was okay, I guess.
**Jdawson**: Their attorney is kind of a something else.
**Jdawson**: But we're going to respond to them and get that going.
**Jdawson**: I sent the electrical change, the drawings that were changed to beam electric, get them to price up.
**Jdawson**: It wasn't big, but we need to, we need to write subcontracts for plumbing and electrical and all the fire sprinkler.
**Njepson**: Hey, Jesse, who.
**Njepson**: Who are you?
**Njepson**: Who's going to be the super on that job?
**Jdawson**: Mike.
**Njepson**: Mike will be okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, he'll be right there in Burnville.
**Jdawson**: It's two hour drive so he can go back and forth between them and handle it.
**Njepson**: How much more Burnville do we have to.
**Njepson**: Do.
**Gducharme**: We have like maybe, I don't know, four weeks maybe.
**Gducharme**: I mean, I'm trying to condense it.
**Gducharme**: We're going to look at doing some acceleration and see if the owner will pay for it.
**Gducharme**: But you know, four to six weeks.
**Njepson**: Let me work out perfect Dane, because if you're just now writing subcontracts, we may not start Uniqlo Right.
**Njepson**: For six weeks.
**Njepson**: Anyway.
**Jdawson**: They want us there about June.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, he wants us there in June, which we'll see what happens.
**Njepson**: Cool.
**Jdawson**: I was gonna have, you know, depending on Bloomington if we can get past the permit, which I still need to dive into that today.
**Jdawson**: But next week possibly have Jack because we have never been in that facility and it'd be good to have them go in and actually verify where everything is.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, all the sprinklers, lines and the electrical panels and then actually field dimension with the building sizes to make sure they got that right on the drawings too.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Something here that we need to change.
**Bclymer**: Jesse, falling structure project is still not started.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, it's not started.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: The design release, I think, I don't know.
**Jdawson**: Brandon, are you going to release sprinkler anyways to get going?
**Jdawson**: I believe they have been.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, I already released.
**Gducharme**: I already released sprinkler design.
**Gducharme**: I should have the fabrication drawings done by Friday.
**Gducharme**: So I should have the new head count and footage today, you know, this evening Maybe.
**Gducharme**: And then so I'm gonna send that out to get some updated pricing for sprinkler based off of that.
**Gducharme**: And then, you know, we just need to get pricing for the electrical from deem and then I want to.
**Gducharme**: I'd like to submit a change before I execute their contract since it's.
**Gducharme**: You know, there's a bunch of bullshit in there with change orders that I don't want to have to abide to.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: AJ Restaurant build out crate.
**Bclymer**: No update.
**Njepson**: No update there.

**Gducharme**: Crazy games.
**Njepson**: No, I don't have this.
**Njepson**: This is a different one.
**Njepson**: Brandon.
**Gducharme**: Oh, gotcha.
**Njepson**: That's.
**Njepson**: This is just a little restaurant.
**Njepson**: You want me to get closeout documents for the.

**Njepson**: Well, it's.
**Njepson**: It's covered under the crate.

**Bclymer**: Okay, so that's good.
**Bclymer**: Goodwill treatment.
**Bclymer**: So this is Brandon and Jesse, if I'm around.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So we're just waiting on them to confirm the final design.
**Jdawson**: Nick's going to follow.
**Jdawson**: And you can put Nick as the PM on this now.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: On the design you said.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: And you said the owner, but I want the project manager to be Nick, so let me do.
**Bclymer**: Move inside.
**Bclymer**: Oh, here is.
**Bclymer**: He's still the project manager, so that's good.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Poor collective.
**Bclymer**: This is Brandon.
**Jdawson**: So that I don't know what they need from us at this point.
**Jdawson**: Brandon.
**Jdawson**: It sounds like from our last meeting, you know.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Gducharme**: The only thing that we need is.
**Gducharme**: Which I.
**Gducharme**: I don't know if you want to, I guess make a separate project now for the hotel down there.
**Gducharme**: But they just need a, you know, a site plan, a loose site plan and rendering, like just a footprint plan and rendering for the hotel.
**Gducharme**: That's the main thing.
**Gducharme**: And then it's still just if they.
**Jdawson**: Want us to combine showing the volleyball court and the hotel.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, they want to see him.
**Gducharme**: They want to see him work.
**Gducharme**: They want to see like the transition working together.
**Gducharme**: So like trails, things like that.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so you want me to add as a new task and we'll get.
**Jdawson**: Andres, you could possibly.
**Jdawson**: I don't know how quick we got to get that turned around, but.
**Gducharme**: Okay, a couple weeks.
**Jdawson**: Hey, Andres, I'll show you the details and they sent us a video of the overall site plan there which we'll just have to piece some stuff together and get our get our bearings on that.
**Adelgado**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: We're officially hotel hoteliers.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So Andres, you want me to add you here as well so you can follow up?
**Adelgado**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So let me just put here so you can just.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Seminole Collective Jesse that's.
**Jdawson**: We're waiting on the city for information and direction on who's building their volleyball court.
**Jdawson**: We sent them that.
**Jdawson**: We sent them a drawing showing the.
**Jdawson**: There's basically two parcels they want to create one for the container area and one for the volleyball area because one will belong to the city.
**Jdawson**: So we sent that to them last week and then they're also.
**Jdawson**: That said in three weeks we'll receive a survey of the area we're developing.
**Jdawson**: So then we'll know the drainage.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so nothing here still.
**Bclymer**: Everything is in progress.
**Bclymer**: Correct the estimate, the containers hub, the design team, pricing still in progress?
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: AJ Applied Engineer office role model.
**Njepson**: Yep.
**Njepson**: So yeah, my update.
**Njepson**: So still waiting on CDs.
**Njepson**: They.
**Njepson**: They followed up with the apply team and I haven't seen a reply yet so I, I've sent it out to.
**Njepson**: To Subs to confirm some pricing.
**Njepson**: From what we have so far, pricing has actually gone down.
**Njepson**: So that's a good thing.
**Njepson**: More money in our pocket.
**Njepson**: Met with Superior last week.
**Njepson**: I did talk with Mark Lehman about figuring out when they're going to have an MEP plan for me.
**Njepson**: He said they're currently working on them but he still hasn't sent them out yet.
**Njepson**: So buyouts in progress.
**Njepson**: I'll.
**Njepson**: Once we have a final contract amount, I'll put a contract together for it much it.
**Bclymer**: Okay, thank you then.
**Bclymer**: Bill Theater, this is you.
**Njepson**: Yeah, I met with Bill on site last week.
**Njepson**: He wants to add the loft that we had originally talked about.
**Njepson**: So job just got bigger and now I gotta.
**Njepson**: We're trying to find like a residential architect potentially or, or someone that would want to do it like on the side.
**Njepson**: I haven't, I haven't found one yet so I'll probably work on that next week.
**Gducharme**: Why don't you just use like a normal architect?
**Gducharme**: Why are you going out of the way to find somebody who's cheaper?
**Njepson**: Not cheaper, but I don't think.
**Gducharme**: I.
**Njepson**: Mean, I don't know, I haven't really called around but I don't think like a studio access who works on billion dollar jobs would want to draw up adding a loft, you know, above an.
**Gducharme**: Old theater what about dkgr?
**Ataylor**: That's.
**Njepson**: That's not a bad idea.
**Njepson**: Yeah, I'm using.
**Njepson**: They've been responding well on Neiman, so I was thinking like maybe a Mitch Design, because they do arc.
**Njepson**: They do houses too.
**Gducharme**: I would ask both.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Neiman Holding, FedEx.
**Njepson**: AJ yeah, so I just found out they're not going to add the second entrance, so I.
**Njepson**: We had a price increase when I went to buy out the steel, and so I'm waiting for that to come back.
**Njepson**: As far as changing our contract amount, I did submit to the city of Carmel for permits.
**Njepson**: They won't even look at it until we get our CDR back.
**Njepson**: We just submitted two weeks, so we should receive that CDR any minute now.
**Njepson**: I'm on the email list so that we.
**Njepson**: We paid for the fees early last week, so just waiting to get that pricing in and then I'll be able to finalize a contract amount.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Everything is.
**Bclymer**: Some of the things are in progress.
**Bclymer**: Is that correct?
**Njepson**: Yep, that's all correct.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Aspires and Lucy, this is Nick.
**Bclymer**: I don't know if he's on the call.
**Speaker 6**: Yeah, that's just close out documents and final billing.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Which will be this month, right, Nick?
**Speaker 6**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Brandon Cormark, exotech.
**Gducharme**: Still waiting on the fire alarm to get done by arco and then I need to.
**Gducharme**: I just need to final bill and send them the change order.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Glenn.
**Bclymer**: Westfield Collective.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Gducharme**: Riveting.
**Ataylor**: I can't find your window.
**Ataylor**: I'm just gonna have to pull mine up.
**Ataylor**: Hold on.
**Ataylor**: All right.
**Ataylor**: Westfield Collective Stormline is all the way through the volleyball courts.
**Ataylor**: Currently, citizens just approved our water plan set and I got stamped of those.
**Ataylor**: Now the water and gas are now at the admin office bidding there for up to 14 business days just so they can send me a link to pay to get our actual permit.
**Ataylor**: Not kidding.
**Ataylor**: The pad was still pretty wet, but they did start trucking in dirt today.
**Ataylor**: You know, start building the pad tomorrow and hopefully it holds off Friday long enough so they can finish it out.
**Ataylor**: JQOL has confirmed today that they will have the shop drawings back to me today.
**Ataylor**: So I'm waiting for those to show up here in the email so I can get those over to cnc.
**Ataylor**: As of now, we are still scheduled to begin AG peers next week, even though we are planning on getting some more weather here this weekend.
**Ataylor**: As long as we can get that pad up then should be okay to start on Monday.
**Ataylor**: Steel foundation coordination stuff.
**Ataylor**: We got an answer back from lemass, so they pretty much were able to fix all the column locations that were messed up or added.
**Ataylor**: They did end up keeping two on the outside patio.
**Ataylor**: So JQOL will mark those up in their submittal response to CNC and they can keep going.
**Ataylor**: I spoke with Merit today, got them the updated permit set or the updated foundation set so they can finalize their estimate.
**Ataylor**: The guy who was our estimator, Brent, is no longer with them, so Wayne was taken over and he wanted to have a chance to get familiar with the estimate and review it.
**Ataylor**: I explained to him the only two things that were added were those two columns.
**Ataylor**: Otherwise the price was already given to us based on their VE suggestions, which were all accepted.
**Ataylor**: So I don't know how much he's going to charge those two columns, but we were at 496,000, I think, so should hopefully stay under 500 and be done.
**Ataylor**: And I'll get the buyout done with those guys.
**Ataylor**: Done with the drain tile, done with the reconstructing of the drain line, which is just our RCP line off of the farm property.
**Ataylor**: We're getting to get back filled and take our sweet fence down and wrap it up and get off of his property at the end of the week here.
**Ataylor**: I got a few commitments left to right, mostly the finishes up in the air.
**Ataylor**: Brandon, I did speak with Eli.
**Ataylor**: He's going to get us a, a cost and a timeline together.
**Ataylor**: He did.
**Ataylor**: He asked how, how long, what his time frame was to get us updated finishes if he were to take over.
**Ataylor**: I told him quickly, but other than that I didn't have a time.
**Gducharme**: When's he, when's he going to get us a proposal?
**Ataylor**: I think, I think by tomorrow.
**Ataylor**: I just spoke, I just got off the phone about 30 minutes ago.
**Ataylor**: This is a plan basically just to give him the models from Access that we have now and he'll have essentially a canvas that's already framed for him to select finishes and all that stuff.
**Ataylor**: He has some questions.
**Gducharme**: We're going to give him.
**Ataylor**: We're.
**Gducharme**: We're going to give him everything that we have, you know, and then, you know, see what it is.
**Gducharme**: So he can give us a number for doing the interior design and then he can give another line item.
**Gducharme**: So saying that what FF&E costs, so he can just break it out, you.
**Ataylor**: Know, that he provides the actual FF&E material too.
**Ataylor**: Right.
**Ataylor**: Not just the design of it.
**Ataylor**: That's a, that's something he does offer.
**Ataylor**: I told him to add it as an alternate, but that's what he does.
**Gducharme**: That's fine.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Yep.
**Ataylor**: So he's working on that.
**Ataylor**: He had some questions kind of about like the booths and stuff.
**Ataylor**: Are those gonna be millwork?
**Ataylor**: And I told him what we had discussed more.
**Ataylor**: So it was like basically table and chair style stuff that you can move in and move out.
**Ataylor**: Nothing's gonna be mounted to the floors or anything.
**Ataylor**: Is that still, that's still accurate?
**Ataylor**: Is.
**Ataylor**: Does he, I mean he, he knows what he put in Liberty, so he can.
**Gducharme**: Let's just get a proposal before we ask a zillion questions.
**Gducharme**: Because I can sit here and answer all questions.
**Gducharme**: Well, tell them to be like, just dude, give us a line item to do it all.
**Gducharme**: Like say like I want.
**Gducharme**: Here's a line item for the interior.
**Gducharme**: Here's a full line item for the design for the FF and E.
**Gducharme**: Here's a full line item for providing it if you want to.
**Gducharme**: But I need the design numbers.
**Gducharme**: That's what I really care about.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, he wants to provide all three through this five.
**Gducharme**: But it, it's a moot point if he's like, oh, it's going to cost me $400,000 to design it.
**Gducharme**: Like we have to know that.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, the.
**Ataylor**: Well again, if he has to design the millwork and all that versus just choose furniture that we're going to move in and is able to move, that's a cost difference.
**Ataylor**: That's why I'm trying.
**Ataylor**: That's, that's, that's why I'm asking this question.
**Gducharme**: I mean the only millwork are, is the, the bars and the restrooms.
**Gducharme**: Like, you know, there's not a bunch of millwork like the FF&E, which is furniture is going to be its own line item.
**Gducharme**: Like I don't care about that.
**Gducharme**: I want the interior design stuff.
**Gducharme**: So that millwork.
**Gducharme**: Yes, the casework and everything like that.
**Gducharme**: It's, you know, the bar's not going to change much.
**Gducharme**: Like if he's like, if he thinks it is, like he's wrong.
**Gducharme**: Like there's not a lot you can change on it.
**Ataylor**: No, not the bars again.
**Ataylor**: Mostly like the booths because they show like U shaped booths, you know.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, yeah.
**Gducharme**: The boot.
**Gducharme**: The booths are furniture.
**Gducharme**: So.
**Gducharme**: Yes.
**Gducharme**: I don't, I don't care.
**Ataylor**: Got it.
**Ataylor**: What else?
**Ataylor**: Idem permit.
**Ataylor**: There's that.
**Ataylor**: That's getting sent to Ashton again sanitary and water with citizens.
**Ataylor**: Right now.
**Ataylor**: All we have to do is get the link to pay and we'll have our permits for them.
**Ataylor**: The platting is in progress right now.
**Ataylor**: The attorneys and Ashton have filed their first round of whatever they needed to file for, for Combining the two parcels.
**Ataylor**: So we're on the move.
**Ataylor**: With that good weather tomorrow.
**Ataylor**: Hopefully good weather on Friday, at least for a little while.
**Ataylor**: So we can get this pad built up.
**Ataylor**: And didn't end up needing to do any type of stabilization or till so finishes again.
**Ataylor**: I still have that left to buy out.
**Ataylor**: We'll see how long it takes Eli to come back and then everybody can finish up their final estimates with.
**Ataylor**: With the finish schedule once they get it.
**Ataylor**: Did you hear the answer about the traction additive and everything, Brandon, from the email?
**Ataylor**: Did you recall you asked why.
**Gducharme**: No.
**Gducharme**: Are you.
**Gducharme**: What do you mean did I hear the email about the traction?
**Ataylor**: Did you read the email?
**Ataylor**: The response was because it's a restaurant and there's grease and stuff on the floor that Tyler recommended that we do.
**Ataylor**: That's the application that we would do for.
**Ataylor**: For the kitchen, restaurant, bar areas.
**Ataylor**: There would be a traction additive.
**Ataylor**: And then the densifier is the sealer.
**Ataylor**: It's the type of sealer.
**Ataylor**: It was a densifier so that we're getting the getting sealed anyways.
**Ataylor**: So it's really just a traction additive.
**Ataylor**: Again, I got an estimate for 36 grand and estimate for 12.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: And the traction additive is recommended or code.
**Ataylor**: It's recommended because.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: Is there.
**Gducharme**: Is there another way to get traction without applying that in that.
**Gducharme**: For instance, a lot of times you see rubber mats behind bars.
**Ataylor**: Yes.
**Ataylor**: They could be responsible to put their own rubber bar river mats down.
**Gducharme**: Okay, great.
**Ataylor**: Suggest the steel concrete.
**Ataylor**: No traction additive.
**Gducharme**: Correct.
**Gducharme**: We're going to do steel concrete.
**Gducharme**: Now you can get a number to do the steel traction additive in the actual kitchen spaces and behind the bar.
**Gducharme**: We definitely don't need it everywhere.
**Gducharme**: But if you want to get a number for just those specific spots and then we can put that in front of the owner and say, hey, do you want to do traction additive or do you just want to do bar mats?
**Gducharme**: Or what is your.
**Gducharme**: What do you want to do?
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Something else going from here.
**Adelgado**: I'm just gonna.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, pretty much.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, Brandon, Pretty much half the price is the traction additive.
**Ataylor**: It's 65 for the sealed concrete and 58 for the traction additive.
**Ataylor**: So I can figure that out based on the square footage.
**Ataylor**: It's basically two bucks a square foot, essentially.
**Ataylor**: So we knocked that down to a thousand square feet instead of be a.
**Ataylor**: We had a couple hundred bucks instead of 5,800 bucks.
**Ataylor**: Is that worth still going to the owner about or should we just go ahead and do the do that?
**Gducharme**: We're not going to go ahead and do it without.
**Gducharme**: We don't even know if the owner wants to do it, so.
**Gducharme**: No, get me a number, and then we'll put it in front of them.
**Gducharme**: Again, we don't like.
**Gducharme**: For all we know, they don't want it.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: That'S it then for Westfield Collective.
**Ataylor**: Their job is the Goodwill Foundation.
**Ataylor**: Oh, sorry.
**Ataylor**: Never mind.
**Bclymer**: No, it's okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, so I think the next one is Goodwill Corp.
**Bclymer**: So this is.
**Speaker 6**: That's in for permitting.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Still, permit is in progress, correct?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Speaker 6**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Jesse, Siva Consulting or Brandon.
**Gducharme**: I mean, that's Burnville.
**Gducharme**: I mean, so this is Mike.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Gducharme**: Siva Consulting building is Burnville.
**Gducharme**: I don't know.
**Gducharme**: I guess we have two jobs set up.
**Gducharme**: Is that what I'm seeing?
**Jdawson**: I think we were talking about Uniqlo.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Gducharme**: So Burnville is.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, I mean, it's finalizing the schedule and, you know, just getting it done at this point.
**Bclymer**: And then I already add Mike.
**Bclymer**: Okay, perfect.
**Bclymer**: Goodwill Bloomington.
**Bclymer**: This is Nick.
**Speaker 6**: Yeah, Bloomington also.
**Speaker 6**: We're waiting on the permit.
**Jdawson**: Nick, what happened?
**Jdawson**: Like, did Brian get another response after he talked to them?
**Speaker 6**: Brian talked to him on the phone, and then he followed up with an email.
**Speaker 6**: And the city never responded to the email.
**Speaker 6**: I saw the developers or the owner of the building, they.
**Speaker 6**: They responded to the email this afternoon.
**Speaker 6**: So hopefully the city says something.
**Jdawson**: The developer responded.
**Jdawson**: And what did he say?
**Speaker 6**: He.
**Speaker 6**: He just.
**Speaker 6**: He replied to that email chain saying that he.
**Speaker 6**: He's doing his best on the easement.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Aspire Newport.
**Bclymer**: Richie, this is Jesse.
**Bclymer**: If I'm wrong, Nick, that's you.
**Speaker 6**: Yeah, that's the same thing.
**Speaker 6**: Closeout documents and final billing this month.

**Njepson**: Brandon and Jesse, we talked about this on Monday before I left for Dallas.

**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Nick, Goodwill bird.

**Jdawson**: They Want us to add two more lights and two more strobes in the bathrooms and more door signage and then they want Goodwill to have their signage done as well.
**Gducharme**: Wait, after they said this is the.
**Gducharme**: The comments, they're adding more?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, well, their follow up inspection and they added more stuff.
**Jdawson**: You know.

**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Ag Cratescape.
**Njepson**: Yeah, so we got the windows put in today.
**Njepson**: Getting everything closed up, tidying up the stone and really the big, big thing on my radar is trying to get this proof roll done.
**Njepson**: So other than that we're tracking it being done and out of there.
**Bclymer**: Okay, perfect.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Njepson**: The only thing I guess Brandon dropped, but he was asking me about close out docs, which I have them all there in the folder.
**Njepson**: I'll just have to get one from Diamond Glass now that they're done today and then I'll be all done with those.
**Jdawson**: So the windows fit?
**Njepson**: Yeah, yeah, they look good.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Njepson**: I was leaving this morning, Jesse, and they.
**Njepson**: They were finishing up the trim around them and stuff.

**Njepson**: We put a.
**Njepson**: An email together, you know, before everything happens with the welding each night, tracking prevailing wind and mitigation and all that.
**Njepson**: And Ulta was super pleased with it.
**Njepson**: So all is good there.
**Njepson**: We're set to have the OPEX done next week.
**Njepson**: I did get a PO for moving these RTUs, so I gotta buy that out, figure out how we can source them in time.
**Njepson**: But other than that, all is good.
**Njepson**: Can you scroll down, Maria?
**Njepson**: I want to see what other tasks I'm going to make sure I marked all the tasks correctly.
**Adelgado**: Okay.

**Bclymer**: And then I think they're asking for other things.
**Bclymer**: Brandon, Fatima just sent one of the truck lease agreement from 2024, but I think they need 2023, so I'm not sure if you have that.
**Jdawson**: The accountants need it not.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, for some reason as needed.
**Bclymer**: So yeah, they need.
**Bclymer**: They want to see the all truck allowances or vehicle.
**Bclymer**: Not allowances.
**Bclymer**: Sorry.
**Bclymer**: All the lease agreements that we have for the trucks.
**Bclymer**: So Fatima sent to the 2024, but we still need the 2023, so we need to find it.

**Ataylor**: I got the abatement started today.
**Ataylor**: They'll be done probably by maybe next Wednesday.

**Ataylor**: However, I just.
**Jdawson**: Hold on.
**Jdawson**: So we got to get this pricing together, which is supposed to be done right now.
**Jdawson**: All we're doing is the abatement, and then that's fun.
**Jdawson**: When Andres gets that.
**Jdawson**: Him and Andrew are working on that.
**Jdawson**: They get that pricing back by Wednesday, we gotta trim it down till we want to get to around 250 on our final price.
**Jdawson**: So we'll see where that is, and then we'll send the price in, and then we can release everyone once we get a full contract amount that works for them.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Emily from Shot replied a few minutes ago or sometime today.
**Ataylor**: And so basically, it's going to take her a week to do the code compliance part of the estimate and send it to us for approval for the design, and then it'll take her three weeks to put together a permanent set of drawings.
**Ataylor**: So a month once we get.
**Ataylor**: Really go ahead.

**Njepson**: I got.
**Njepson**: I got two other jobs from Houston that he's gonna be sending our way here, so.

**Jdawson**: You know, they're showing us building 600 condos, but I don't know that there's a market for 600 condos there or how long that would take to sell things like that.

**Njepson**: So I was able to connect with Ashton.
**Njepson**: Learned a little bit more of the site.
**Njepson**: I'm glad that we spoke because we will have to add an aqua swirl and we kind of walk through our layout.
**Njepson**: We are able to reuse the aggregate.
**Njepson**: So I just need to see if we realistically can get to 750.
**Njepson**: If we can't, then that job will go away.
**Bclymer**: Okay, Great clip.
**Bclymer**: Function Plaza.
**Bclymer**: Easy.

**Njepson**: I need to send an updated contract over to Corm.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so this is not started, correct?
**Njepson**: It is not started, but needs to be done here this week because it is now it will be an active job.
**Njepson**: They've asked me to send them a contract.
**Njepson**: So.
**Bclymer**: Awesome.
**Bclymer**: Greatly sounds like pleasant.
**Njepson**: I got the landlord work letter.
**Njepson**: So I'll coordinate and price accordingly with the shell general contractor.

**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: Yeah, sorry, I was about to go tell them to mute themselves.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Njepson**: Yep.
**Njepson**: I sent the markup out to the plumbing subs.
**Njepson**: I'm just waiting on the Updated pricing and then that, that should be a job.
**Njepson**: I know they're working on getting the approval for the original budget so they can get us released.
**Bclymer**: No tasks so far, correct?
**Njepson**: Okay, yeah, no, I'm glad you mentioned that.
**Njepson**: So I try, I've been trying to add tasks onto this and I think it's just creating empty tasks because the job does not populate in there.
**Njepson**: So I think you got to work it out on.
**Njepson**: On Notion's back end.
**Njepson**: So if you go to, to new.
**Njepson**: New.
**Njepson**: Yep.
**Njepson**: Type it in there.
**Njepson**: New task here.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: See all those, see all those blank ones?
**Njepson**: Task, task, task.
**Njepson**: I think that's from me.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Njepson**: Because there's nothing it.
**Njepson**: And then when you go to the project to active Maria.
**Njepson**: So I was trying to search for the project to add it, but Bella Canvas does not pop up there.
**Bclymer**: Gotcha.
**Bclymer**: All right, I'll figure it out.
**Njepson**: But yeah, I think the mix up happened when you know, it was an active job and then we moved it to back down to estimating and.
**Njepson**: Or pausing.
**Bclymer**: So usually all we do is just, just like click it here and then, you know, like that's what we move it right to the.
**Bclymer**: For example in this case the, you see maybe for example this one that says what was it a project?
**Bclymer**: No, the name was estimate.
**Bclymer**: So we were supposed to move it to the estimating.
**Bclymer**: What you see the ones that said estimating.
**Bclymer**: So we move it just like that.
**Bclymer**: But my question to you is, did you had previously tasks on this one?
**Njepson**: I.
**Njepson**: I think I did previously have tasks on it, yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so I'll check it out because maybe you know what happens.
**Bclymer**: Sometimes they are on the trash your task.
**Bclymer**: Sometimes you see this one.
**Bclymer**: So sometimes the tasks are going to trash every time we move into a new database.
**Bclymer**: So let me check them out if, if not I'll just, you know, make sure everything is there.
**Njepson**: Yep.
**Njepson**: Yeah, I was trying to add tasks, but it's fine.
**Njepson**: I mean I, I write it in the updates.
**Bclymer**: Thank you, AJ and final one.
**Bclymer**: Morning Yard.
**Bclymer**: This is Brandon, Jesse.
**Jdawson**: Andrew Drees.
**Jdawson**: I think you got some container pricing on that.
**Adelgado**: Exactly.
**Adelgado**: Yes, I have a quote about that.
**Jdawson**: But that was simply just an empty container that wasn't priced to make it into a restaurant.
**Bclymer**: Okay, is the estimates that startup estimates are still not started or is this in progress?
**Bclymer**: It's in progress.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Well, it's.
**Jdawson**: We're kind of too waiting on the owner.
**Jdawson**: We asked them about that and they're like we're just not ready to select a contractor yet.
**Jdawson**: But I think we're trying to put together a number.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So I'll leave it as not started yet.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Something else you guys want to add to the estimated part or your current current jobs?

**Jdawson**: We went over that today to make up a floor plan.
**Jdawson**: Go ahead.
**Jdawson**: And Andres and Nick, you guys can give her an up down of what we're doing.
**Speaker 6**: We did the a rough layout today, and Andres, he.
**Speaker 6**: He's gonna.
**Speaker 6**: He's gonna drop walls with like actual dimensions.
**Adelgado**: Yeah, exactly.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Something else that we need to add?
**Njepson**: No.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Everybody good?
**Bclymer**: Any other projects?
**Bclymer**: So, aj, I think your problem because, you know, I just added this one and it's creating already like the task.
**Bclymer**: So what I want to do.
**Bclymer**: I'll check yours.
**Bclymer**: It's okay.
**Bclymer**: I know what's the problem.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Go ahead.
**Njepson**: Is it something I can fix?
**Bclymer**: You know what I will do is just.
**Bclymer**: This is Bella Chemist.
**Bclymer**: So what I want to do is just try to create a new one, actually, because when I create a new one, it actually has all the template of the estimate.
**Bclymer**: I think yours was like a, you know, like a copy paste thing.
**Bclymer**: So we never paste these ones.
**Bclymer**: So I'm just going to go ahead and create a new one and then I'll let you know if it works.
**Bclymer**: If not, I'll just try to ask Megan.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Njepson**: Okay, Sounds good.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
