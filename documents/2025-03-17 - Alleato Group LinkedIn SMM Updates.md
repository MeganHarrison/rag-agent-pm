## Transcript
**Victoria**: Thank you.
**Victoria**: Happy St Patrick's Day to you, too.
**Bclymer**: Are you doing anything fun?
**Bclymer**: No one really does anything for this holiday.
**Victoria**: No, definitely not.
**Victoria**: I feel like we're.
**Victoria**: We're way too lame to do anything fun.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I mean, it's not really a holiday you really do things for anyway.
**Victoria**: It's just so weird that it's on a Monday, I guess.
**Bclymer**: I know, I know.
**Bclymer**: Anything would be done over the weekend, I guess.
**Victoria**: I was thinking about it, and I was like, well, it'd be fun to be in college right now, because FSU had their spring break last week, and today is, like, the first day of classes.
**Victoria**: And I was like, well, if you came back from spring break to a holiday, that would be fun.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, that would definitely be fun.
**Victoria**: And Sammy also had spring break last week, and Alyssa, she goes to fsu, so that's why I was thinking about it.
**Bclymer**: Oh, good, good, good.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Victoria**: Not because I'm, like, dreaming of college or anything.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: Colby has this thing called Dog Head, which is.
**Bclymer**: I don't know why it's called that, but for St.
**Bclymer**: Patrick's Day weekend, they stay up, like, 24 hours and watch the sunrise on the steps, you know, so.
**Bclymer**: And you're also supposed to swallow a goldfish, which people don't do.
**Bclymer**: People do do.
**Bclymer**: Gross.
**Victoria**: That's crazy.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I never did it, but.
**Bclymer**: Well.
**Victoria**: Annika, did I ever send you a CCC bag?
**Victoria**: I couldn't remember.
**Bclymer**: Yes, yes, yes, I have it.
**Bclymer**: It's actually my dance.
**Bclymer**: Oh, okay.
**Bclymer**: Perfect.
**Bclymer**: Perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect.
**Victoria**: Just double checking.
**Victoria**: I'm sending out Shelby's, and I had to order more, and I was like, well, let me just ask Annika because I can't keep life straight anymore, but.
**Bclymer**: Okay, I'm glad.
**Bclymer**: No, no, no.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah, I got mine.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: All good.
**Bclymer**: All good.
**Bclymer**: How.
**Bclymer**: How is Ariel going?
**Victoria**: It's going good.
**Victoria**: I have my performance down.
**Victoria**: I would send it to you, but there's a.
**Victoria**: Like, I'll have to tell you an article about it, but it's going really good.
**Victoria**: Thank you for asking.
**Bclymer**: Sure.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: It's coming up, right?
**Bclymer**: April something.
**Victoria**: Yes, April something.
**Victoria**: The fourth.
**Victoria**: No, the eighth.
**Victoria**: It's, like, the first weekend of April.
**Bclymer**: Oh, okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: The eighth is when I get my tonsils out, so I think that's a Tuesday, so it's probably, like.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Victoria**: No, no, it's right before your tonsils.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, let's see, let's see.
**Bclymer**: I think it'll be a fairly quick call today.
**Bclymer**: Just gonna go over.
**Bclymer**: Oh, here.
**Bclymer**: Brandon's here.
**Bclymer**: Brandon.
**Bclymer**: Hi.
**Bclymer**: Brandon.
**Jdawson**: Hey.
**Jdawson**: How are you?
**Bclymer**: Good.
**Bclymer**: How are you?
**Jdawson**: Good, Good.
**Mcalcetero**: And again on that one.
**Bclymer**: Can you hear us?
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Can you hear us?
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: I can.
**Jdawson**: Can you hear me?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I can hear you.
**Bclymer**: Okay, great.
**Bclymer**: Are we going to be joined by Maria, a couple other people, or is it just us today?
**Jdawson**: I don't know.
**Jdawson**: Let's just roll with it.
**Jdawson**: We're tight on schedules.
**Bclymer**: Oh, here's Maria.
**Bclymer**: I'm gonna let her in.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So we can start with just connecting on the drone.
**Bclymer**: So is that still possible to get done this month?
**Mcalcetero**: It is.
**Bclymer**: I know that we had one in mind.
**Jdawson**: Is that.
**Jdawson**: What project are we going to do?
**Bclymer**: What.
**Bclymer**: What.
**Jdawson**: What project were we going to do for the drone footage?
**Bclymer**: I don't know if I can remember the project.
**Bclymer**: It was one of AJ's.
**Bclymer**: I'd have to look back.
**Jdawson**: Oh, it was.
**Jdawson**: It was.
**Jdawson**: It was all the.
**Jdawson**: It was all the Crate one.
**Bclymer**: That's what it was.
**Jdawson**: What the footage was.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, it was the time lapse and the video drone footage for Crate.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And we have those.
**Jdawson**: Aj, are we gonna be able to get that footage?
**Bclymer**: I just gotta take it out of the trailer.
**Jdawson**: Yes, he's.
**Jdawson**: He'll get it that way.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And he has the.
**Bclymer**: The questions.
**Bclymer**: I.
**Bclymer**: I've sent them before.
**Bclymer**: I could send them again.
**Bclymer**: Like the prompts for something on camera.
**Bclymer**: He should have them.
**Mcalcetero**: Good.
**Jdawson**: If not, Maria, just please track that and make sure that we get it done.
**Bclymer**: Perfect.
**Bclymer**: You mean for so.
**Bclymer**: Or.
**Ataylor**: Or what's.
**Jdawson**: Whatever.
**Jdawson**: Whatever questions she's talking about that need to be answered.
**Jdawson**: Oh, just so.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: But those are for aj, too.
**Ataylor**: I think so.
**Ataylor**: Right, Anika?
**Ataylor**: Is that what you are?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: In terms of.
**Jdawson**: Figure that out.
**Jdawson**: Put it in notion.
**Jdawson**: Make sure he knows.
**Ataylor**: Oh, I'll forward to ag.
**Ataylor**: You have to do it, period.
**Ataylor**: Okay, good.
**Bclymer**: Okay, great.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so I want to go over the newsletter.
**Mcalcetero**: All right.
**Mcalcetero**: Thanks, man.
**Bclymer**: Here's easier way to preview it.
**Bclymer**: Like this.
**Bclymer**: So everything on here is editable.
**Bclymer**: We like what we don't like.
**Bclymer**: The images would change out each month along with the copy.
**Bclymer**: But these are.
**Bclymer**: This is the content we already went over in a design format.
**Bclymer**: I'm still thinking about these.
**Jdawson**: Will these.
**Jdawson**: Will these newsletters also be blog posts?
**Bclymer**: You mean on LinkedIn.
**Jdawson**: Or a website or something like that to where it helps our SEO?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Victoria**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I mean, we can absolutely post.
**Bclymer**: One of the things we could do is write, like, a blog post that the newsletter links to directly to the site each time so that there's not the whole newsletter on the site.
**Bclymer**: That's definitely an option, because we do have a section for articles that points to elsewhere.
**Bclymer**: So we can always just create our own articles and then.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, and then we could put some of the content, like in a newsletter section on the site.
**Bclymer**: That would definitely work.
**Jdawson**: All right, perfect.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so I'll talk to Maria about getting that situated.
**Bclymer**: And then this is again, you've seen this content before with the list.
**Bclymer**: I still need the list.
**Bclymer**: Leads list from AJ Whenever he has a chance, send that over and that'll help us build a the campaign and the recipients in mailchimp.
**Bclymer**: You're looking for like a list of an email list?
**Bclymer**: Like an email list?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, like a spreadsheet of contacts that I can upload to mailchimp.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so who is a leader group?
**Bclymer**: See this before.
**Bclymer**: This is a build buzz section.
**Bclymer**: This is one option.
**Bclymer**: There's.
**Bclymer**: This is.
**Bclymer**: I was looking for something fairly recent.
**Bclymer**: So this is from February, like the end of February.
**Bclymer**: And it's a Dallas Builders take on design build partnerships.
**Bclymer**: It's just something that's a little bit more national than regional.
**Bclymer**: If you wanted something a little more regional, I could dig a little further, but I wasn't finding a lot of like Indiana, Florida or like Utah based design builders at this moment.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I like national.
**Bclymer**: Okay, great.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, so that's just kind of a broader scope.
**Bclymer**: People are talking about design build all over the country.
**Bclymer**: This is the project feature for the Excel Center.
**Bclymer**: And then there's a CTA to call Brandon.
**Bclymer**: If you click on this, it brings up your phone number.
**Bclymer**: And then this is an inspo of the month.
**Bclymer**: A.
**Jdawson**: That should.
**Jdawson**: That should probably say like call, call Oedo today.
**Jdawson**: I don't know if I should just say me.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Oh, yeah, I'll change that.
**Bclymer**: I'll make it say Paul Alito.
**Ataylor**: And then like, can we make this branded?
**Ataylor**: Like a color wise, like with a little colors type of thing?
**Ataylor**: It looks.
**Ataylor**: I mean, it's like an orange, like gray, like type of thing.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: I can change the colors of the buttons to be more.
**Ataylor**: More like our brand.
**Ataylor**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Thank you.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: Same with this one.
**Bclymer**: I was thinking about putting it as orange, but I wasn't sure if it was too orange.
**Bclymer**: So I can get like your opinion on that.
**Bclymer**: I also can bring in the color in other places.
**Bclymer**: We can absolutely do that.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, you're right.
**Bclymer**: It's right.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, let's.
**Jdawson**: Let's stick to the.
**Jdawson**: Let's stick to the brand guideline as much as we can.
**Bclymer**: Perfect.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And then so inspo the month, little quote, no CTA there and then inviting people to respond, respond to the email, asking them what they'd like to see to kind of, you know, get some interaction there.
**Bclymer**: And that's all we have for the sections.
**Bclymer**: Is there any other thing that's come up that you might want to include in sort of like monthly outreach?
**Ataylor**: What about the Westfield thing for April?
**Ataylor**: I mean, I know it's for March, but we can take like coming up or coming soon.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, some project announcements.
**Bclymer**: Sure.
**Bclymer**: What?
**Bclymer**: Can you give me some details either now or just email Maria.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, because I mean, it's going to be a grand opening and there's going to be the Chamber of commerce there and they already send emails, invites to magazines, local news too.
**Ataylor**: So they already sent the email.
**Ataylor**: So it'll be good just to let them know, like we have another grand opening, so it will be good.
**Ataylor**: So, yeah, I can, I can give you.
**Jdawson**: It's a.
**Victoria**: It's a.
**Jdawson**: It's a.
**Jdawson**: Maria, it's a groundbreaking, not grand opening.
**Ataylor**: Sorry, groundbreaking.
**Ataylor**: So we can, you know, we can talk about it part.
**Ataylor**: As up as part of the newsletter.
**Bclymer**: Okay, perfect.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I can put a coming soon section towards the bottom probably.
**Bclymer**: Okay, great.
**Bclymer**: If we.
**Bclymer**: I will get these little changes made and add some more brand.
**Bclymer**: Make sure it's a brand guidelines and the colors all set.
**Bclymer**: And then as soon as we get that list, we can hopefully send it out this week.
**Bclymer**: Be a great week to send it out for this month.
**Bclymer**: And then we can plan to set to send them like the second to last week of each month or the last week of each month, whatever you prefer.
**Bclymer**: And we're good to go here.
**Bclymer**: Back to the agenda.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So that we want to go over April concepts a bit.
**Bclymer**: There's like two posts that are ready for final review and see and then like so this week you can see April 1st is ready for review.
**Bclymer**: And then these are concepts that we want to talk about and make sure that we have everything you want to feature in April up here.
**Bclymer**: So there's from the real project videos that Maria has sent, we have the Ulta beauty project along with the how to address your problems video and the work life balance video.
**Bclymer**: This is a slot for the drone video.
**Bclymer**: Once we get that from AJ and I'll put it together, obviously.
**Bclymer**: So let's go to this post.
**Bclymer**: This is six tips to boost your design build.
**Bclymer**: And so again, all of these are changeable.
**Bclymer**: These are just some ideas.
**Ataylor**: And so can you sum up a little bit?
**Ataylor**: Sorry, we want to read the.
**Bclymer**: I know it's tiny.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So the Options for now are collaborate from day one, make decisions faster, prioritize cost certainty, build with efficiency, mitigate risk, and focus on results.
**Bclymer**: Initial reactions to those six tips.
**Jdawson**: Number three, needs to change.
**Jdawson**: Okay, Prioritize cost certainty.
**Jdawson**: It doesn't.
**Jdawson**: That's not something that anybody would say.
**Bclymer**: Okay, okay.
**Bclymer**: So instead of prioritized cost certainty, we could say, like, prioritize, like budget.
**Bclymer**: Like I know you were talking about before how, like you put your budget all in the beginning and like, do things early, like forms and different things.
**Bclymer**: So you're not surprised by.
**Jdawson**: So it would be designed to a budget and then make, make, make decisions faster.
**Jdawson**: That opens the door for a negative connotation.
**Jdawson**: Because if I'm reading that and I'm like, it's not always good to make decisions faster.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: You don't want to rush into a decision.
**Jdawson**: Like, you know what that would be is streamlined decision making.
**Bclymer**: Okay, gotcha.
**Ataylor**: What about focus on results?
**Ataylor**: I mean, it's good, but I don't know if it's more like focus on the process, like to make it right during the process.
**Ataylor**: But it's good though.
**Ataylor**: I mean, I'm just like, so, so.
**Jdawson**: When you say focus on the results, when everyone is invested in the outcome, you get a build that's on time, on budget and built.
**Jdawson**: Right?
**Jdawson**: So everybody's focused on the end result.
**Jdawson**: But what you're saying there is everybody's pulling on the rope in the same direction.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so you would rather say everyone pull on the rope in the same direction, something to that extent.
**Jdawson**: That's the idea.
**Jdawson**: Like, like, is that like, with this, it's like, hey, instead of everybody pointing fingers, saying, well, it wasn't my fault, it's the architect's fault, and it's, oh, it's his fault because he didn't have this, and blah, blah.
**Jdawson**: No, no, we're all coming together.
**Jdawson**: We're on the same team.
**Jdawson**: You know, pulled on the rope in the same direction.
**Jdawson**: There is no pointing fingers.
**Jdawson**: Blah, blah.
**Jdawson**: Like that is the what's beautiful about this delivery method.
**Bclymer**: Okay, Yeah, I can make that.
**Jdawson**: And then when you say build with efficiency.
**Jdawson**: So design instructions happen simultaneously, shaving months off your schedule or if your timeline.
**Jdawson**: So what that is is speed to market.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Because carrying costs for builds are what?
**Jdawson**: Today's interest rates are killer.
**Jdawson**: So if you could shave off months, then your debt carry cost goes down.
**Jdawson**: So what we call that is speed to market.
**Bclymer**: Gotcha.
**Bclymer**: Okay, perfect.
**Jdawson**: So mitigate risk.
**Jdawson**: A single point of accountability.
**Jdawson**: Delay.
**Ataylor**: He's breaking up, right?
**Jdawson**: Costly rework.
**Ataylor**: Wait, guys, you have white connection.
**Ataylor**: Brandon.
**Jdawson**: Probably need to grab that entire one.
**Jdawson**: I can kind of hear.
**Bclymer**: That'S fine.
**Bclymer**: We can cut it.
**Bclymer**: And so instead we can do five tips or what would be another tip that you would recommend?
**Bclymer**: Or I can come up with something.
**Bclymer**: If you have something on top of your head.
**Ataylor**: I think that's fine just how you have it.
**Jdawson**: Let's see what five looks like.
**Bclymer**: Sorry, I'm not following exactly what was said because I think that the breaking of kind of changed some things for number five.
**Bclymer**: You want to describe it?
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: And see how five tips looks.
**Jdawson**: Correct?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Gotcha, gotcha.
**Bclymer**: Okay, that sounds good.
**Bclymer**: Okay, perfect.
**Bclymer**: So just make this a little smaller.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So those edits will be ready for our call in two weeks.
**Bclymer**: I mean, it's going to be simple edits, but when we have the rest of the content ready for April.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So those are the two that we want to just get ready for the first week of April.
**Bclymer**: I am avoiding posting on April 1 for now.
**Bclymer**: Unless you wanted to do some sort of joke other than that.
**Bclymer**: Like, I don't see why we would want to post something serious on April 1st, but if you have a burning desire to participate in April Fool's Day, let me know and then see.
**Bclymer**: Oh, great.
**Bclymer**: And then just these.
**Bclymer**: So industry insight.
**Bclymer**: I'll pull that.
**Bclymer**: And so that should just be a graphic, a CEO quote.
**Bclymer**: Again, I will come up with something based on you said before.
**Bclymer**: Unless you have.
**Bclymer**: And from your videos, unless you.
**Bclymer**: Again, all of these are.
**Bclymer**: Unless you have something like, oh, I definitely want to say that.
**Bclymer**: I definitely want to get there.
**Bclymer**: That in there.
**Bclymer**: And then I'm sure between you and.
**Jdawson**: Maria, between you and Maria, there's enough video of me saying stuff.
**Jdawson**: You can come up with something.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, exactly.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Common design build myths.
**Bclymer**: I will get these.
**Bclymer**: I mean, actually you can really speak to these off the top of your head too.
**Bclymer**: Or is there anything that comes to mind when you think of common design build myths?
**Jdawson**: It's more expensive, more risky.
**Bclymer**: Honestly, like three is enough.
**Bclymer**: Slower.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Anything you guys think of.
**Jdawson**: You know, I guess you could do April for April Fool's post.
**Jdawson**: You could do something like, you know, three myths of design.
**Jdawson**: It costs more and it's more risky.
**Jdawson**: April Fools.
**Jdawson**: Not really.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: This actually would work for April Fool's Day.
**Bclymer**: I like that idea.
**Jdawson**: But then again, we also.
**Jdawson**: People may read that out of context, so we probably don't want to do that.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So I'll think about some options there that where it can would not be confusing.
**Jdawson**: We could do Like a post of like a dog as our new superintendent.
**Jdawson**: This is Charles, our new superintendent.
**Jdawson**: That's my dog.
**Ataylor**: Exactly.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so send me a picture of your dog.
**Bclymer**: I'll come up with a cute new hire post.
**Ataylor**: But we should do something like, because.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: He doesn't have bow ties.
**Jdawson**: Like.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, yeah, we should do like because he.
**Ataylor**: Labor shortages or something.
**Ataylor**: Like now Charles is in charge, you know, like, because something.
**Ataylor**: Something like that.
**Jdawson**: There you go.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay, perfect.
**Bclymer**: So yeah, Brandon, if you.
**Bclymer**: Or Maria if you want to send picture of dog.
**Bclymer**: That's perfect.
**Ataylor**: I have one video of Brandon, but I think if you have more pictures of your dog will be great.
**Ataylor**: Like a more.
**Ataylor**: Because they can photoshop it.
**Ataylor**: You know, something cool like employee of the month.
**Ataylor**: I don't know.
**Ataylor**: Something like that or something.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that's good.
**Ataylor**: Victoria.
**Jdawson**: Failing out of doggy daycare is now need superintendent.
**Bclymer**: Perfect.
**Bclymer**: That's great.
**Bclymer**: So we have something there and then we can move some things around or if we don't want one of these.
**Bclymer**: Or three.
**Bclymer**: So for 22nd we have a poll which I think is a great way to get some more engagement with LinkedIn.
**Bclymer**: So that's going to be what's your biggest construction challenge.
**Bclymer**: So that's really.
**Bclymer**: We'd come up with three things that people can choose from and like multiple choice.
**Bclymer**: So for that one specifically, what would you say is the top three things that your clients come to you?
**Bclymer**: I was having like a problem with or challenge.
**Jdawson**: Delays.
**Jdawson**: Delays, cost change orders, change orders or cost overruns.
**Jdawson**: The one you could say cost overruns.
**Jdawson**: Delays, cost overruns.
**Bclymer**: I mean, that's enough for.
**Jdawson**: And then you could do, you could do it.
**Jdawson**: You could do like.
**Jdawson**: Well, change orders and cost over are the same thing.
**Bclymer**: Oh, okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So you can do like delays, you know, change over, crossover runs, leaving the office on time.
**Ataylor**: Deadlines.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jdawson**: The joke is because like, like, you know, that's the hardest part.
**Jdawson**: You're not going to get out on time.
**Bclymer**: Ah, gotcha.
**Bclymer**: I gotcha, gotcha.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, but I like that work life balance.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that's.
**Jdawson**: That's good too.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Is that.
**Bclymer**: Perfect?
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And then the drone video, I can send over those prompts again for AJ when he speaks on camera, whenever he does that this month.
**Bclymer**: And then this work life balance video is just again, one of the ones from Maria's database or not database, you know what I mean?
**Bclymer**: The bunch of stuff she has.
**Bclymer**: So that's it that we can get.
**Bclymer**: Get to go over today.
**Bclymer**: Pretty simple.
**Bclymer**: And then we'll go over the Rest of the April content.
**Bclymer**: Next time.
**Bclymer**: The next call is in two weeks from today, so just March 31st.
**Bclymer**: The other thing is, do we have any update on approval for continuing with case studies from Cratescapes or Bar?
**Jdawson**: What do you mean?
**Jdawson**: What are we supposed to be doing?
**Jdawson**: Did we.
**Jdawson**: Goodwill responded on theirs, right?
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So Goodwill said we could move forward with the case study.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Didn't we send that to him?
**Bclymer**: Maria?
**Jdawson**: And he said, sure, yeah.
**Ataylor**: So Stephanie was a person in charge, but she said, I mean, she's like, coming on enough.
**Ataylor**: But she said it's not a problem.
**Ataylor**: So if you want to attack them.
**Ataylor**: Because that was my question.
**Ataylor**: If you want to use them, we can just go ahead with our Nanika for Goodwill too.
**Ataylor**: And we can tag them.
**Ataylor**: Make sure we do.
**Ataylor**: Because that's what we were asking.
**Ataylor**: And they were like, yeah, sure, go ahead.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so they're also okay to be tagged on socials?
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Yes, let's tag them.
**Ataylor**: And I uploaded, updated some videos of.
**Ataylor**: For you as well from Alex of Cormark Atlanta.
**Ataylor**: So that's already on social media.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, so that's good.
**Ataylor**: And then we need to have.
**Ataylor**: Oh, well, but this is happening later from the Westfield thing.
**Ataylor**: We'll have photos and everything for you, so you can post it on April two about that day.
**Bclymer**: Okay, great.
**Bclymer**: Westfield and.
**Bclymer**: Okay, perfect.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Is there anything else you have on your, you know, schedule that you want to talk about.
**Jdawson**: Me?
**Bclymer**: Anyone?
**Bclymer**: Anyone has any topic that they'd like to discuss before we end?
**Ataylor**: No, I think we're good.
**Jdawson**: That's Maria's department.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, no, I think we're good.
**Ataylor**: And again, Anika, if you need me, always send me an email.
**Ataylor**: You know, I'm ready to send you everything in terms of videos.
**Ataylor**: And for April Fool's Day, I will send you the.
**Ataylor**: The video I have from Charles.
**Ataylor**: But Brandon, if you have like the actual photo cars, like.
**Ataylor**: How do you say that in front?
**Ataylor**: Will be better in.
**Ataylor**: Other than that, I'll keep you posted.
**Ataylor**: Related to other things coming up, but other than that, we're good.
**Bclymer**: Okay, perfect.
**Jdawson**: Sounds good.
**Jdawson**: Thanks, guys.
**Ataylor**: How is the office, aj?
**Ataylor**: Is it looking okay?
**Ataylor**: The CO working space?
**Speaker 5**: Yeah, it's good.
**Speaker 5**: It's good.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: And the Internet, it's kind of like some sometimes, right?
**Ataylor**: So.
**Ataylor**: So I can let Samantha know if you want.
**Ataylor**: If you guys want to.
**Speaker 5**: Yeah, I mean, it hasn't been too bad.
**Speaker 5**: I think it's just because we're all on the same meeting in the same room.
**Mcalcetero**: Maybe that.
**Bclymer**: That's okay.
**Speaker 5**: That's a issue, but video slows it down.
**Speaker 5**: But I think in the future, when we do it, we should just have, like, one person connect to the tv, and then you can just see the whole room.
**Ataylor**: Okay, Let me know if you guys need anything.
**Ataylor**: Lexi told me that you guys can enter whatever food you want and what water.
**Ataylor**: And it's okay.
**Ataylor**: So just feel free to do that.
**Ataylor**: And you have actually the biggest room, so that's good.
**Speaker 5**: It's awesome.
**Speaker 5**: Yeah, no, I appreciate it.
**Ataylor**: Okay, tomorrow you guys have a visit to an office, so I'm going to send you that, guys, so you can go ahead and check it out from 4:30pm to 5:00pm okay?
**Ataylor**: So I'm going to show going to send meetings to everybody.
**Ataylor**: So you guys are booked.
**Speaker 5**: Okay, perfect.
**Speaker 5**: Thank you.
**Ataylor**: Bye.
**Bclymer**: Bye.
