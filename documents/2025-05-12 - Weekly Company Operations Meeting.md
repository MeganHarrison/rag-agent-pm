**Bclymer**: So if you click on.
**Bclymer**: See where it says job?
**Bclymer**: Maria to the left.

**Ataylor**: So it's got a P24 on it.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Now.
**Bclymer**: Now we can go in sequential order.
**Bclymer**: So ulta Dallas.
**Adelgado**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: A.J.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, old Dallas is.
**Gducharme**: It's good.
**Gducharme**: We're just have electricians on site this week.
**Gducharme**: So we finished the OPEC system.
**Gducharme**: Haven't had leaks for the past week and they're done and out of there.
**Gducharme**: They won't come back until the domatic platform gets done or the infill gets done.
**Gducharme**: Other than just electricians on site.
**Ataylor**: We'Re.
**Gducharme**: Doing a side conversion for those RTUs that I had gotten a PO for.
**Gducharme**: And Kelly told me she wants us to use Rogers.
**Gducharme**: So I'm just waiting on Rogers to get me a price back.
**Gducharme**: They're going on site tomorrow at 9am and once I get that be able.
**Njepson**: To start doing that work.
**Bclymer**: Okay, what about.
**Bclymer**: So looking at this budget in here, Jose, you need to get with AJ and go through this budget because we've got two budget codes showing up.
**Bclymer**: You've got kind of the same thing that's happening with Job.
**Ataylor**: That one.
**Bclymer**: So please get in there and look at that one.
**Gducharme**: Which you're talking about the Ulta Dallas.
**Gducharme**: Right.
**Gducharme**: If you remember, we.
**Gducharme**: Holy smokes.
**Gducharme**: It's most of all gotten it.
**Gducharme**: So I think the issue is, Jose, this job was back.
**Gducharme**: I mean it's two years ago.
**Gducharme**: This is when we were using sub jobs, Brandon.
**Gducharme**: So I think yeah.
**Gducharme**: Are getting coded to a non sub job.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So these should still be able to be moved.
**Bclymer**: Like they we had it zeroed out.
**Bclymer**: It shouldn't be doing that still.
**Bclymer**: So let's.
**Bclymer**: Right, Jose, please look into that.
**Njepson**: Okay, that's red.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, I had it zeroed out last week.
**Gducharme**: I know that.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Gducharme**: I'll get with Jose and we'll fix it because yeah.
**Bclymer**: Say it looks like like all your direct costs are going up to that.
**Bclymer**: That section.
**Gducharme**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Which is skewing all the numbers.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: Yes, please jump into that.
**Bclymer**: Get that taken care of, Jose.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: What else on Ulta Dallas?
**Gducharme**: That's all I got.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: When are we going to be done with that thing?
**Gducharme**: It's a good question.
**Gducharme**: As far as.
**Gducharme**: So the go live is in August.
**Gducharme**: As far as our scope goes, you know, right now we're at the mercy of UNARCO getting all their their stuff done so we can come in and finish.
**Gducharme**: But at most, Brandon, I think we.
**Ataylor**: Have a.
**Gducharme**: Two weeks left of sprinkler and, and two weeks left of electrical and then we have to tie in the OPEC system to the fire alarm and our scope is fulfilled there.
**Gducharme**: They did ask me to get them pricing on switching out demod lighting now, so.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so our base contract route, we can be done by the end of May.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, we won't be because we're like I said, like sprinklers pulled off.
**Gducharme**: We're waiting for UNARCO to get done.
**Bclymer**: What do you mean?
**Bclymer**: You narco done with what?
**Gducharme**: They have to finish the platform and finish the infill between C and D mods.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And we don't know when they're going to finish that.
**Gducharme**: I haven't gotten an update.
**Gducharme**: We'll see on Wednesday in our vendor meeting.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: 24101 create escapes.
**Adelgado**: AJ Yep.
**Gducharme**: Just have the front path to get completed.
**Gducharme**: I sent photos to Weston on the PD corrections.
**Gducharme**: Once we get that done, we'll be out of there.
**Gducharme**: Brandon, you had mentioned maybe wanting to get some USB devices to send to put our closeout docs on.
**Gducharme**: Is that something that you want me to wait on or can I go ahead and just pick up a.
**Bclymer**: Go ahead and pick up a USB drive.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Do you have all the closeouts?
**Gducharme**: Still waiting on on Providence, but everybody else though.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, I gotta organize them, but I will when I put them on the usb.
**Gducharme**: So I'll pick one up and I'll have that done here tomorrow.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: What about the check?
**Gducharme**: I, I, I Asked Weston when I could pick it up today.
**Gducharme**: I emailed him, so we'll see what he says.
**Bclymer**: I thought he had already said that he would tell the girls you could pick it up.
**Gducharme**: I.
**Gducharme**: I had to send him the pictures, which I sent to him.
**Bclymer**: Did you just send him those today?
**Bclymer**: I guess.
**Gducharme**: Or I sent him this morning.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Didn't we finish it up last week?
**Gducharme**: We finished it Friday.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Nick Goodwill.
**Ataylor**: Bart Goodwill.
**Jmendez**: Bart Goodwill signed the change order today for the additional items they requested during the punch block.
**Jmendez**: So now we can order.
**Jmendez**: Order the material and then schedule Alex for final day day.
**Bclymer**: So is that this right here, this pricing additional request?
**Bclymer**: That's already done, yeah.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Make sure that we go in and update these prior to the meeting if we could, please.
**Jmendez**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So closing documents, you're working on that?
**Jmendez**: Yeah, I sent an email this morning saying that everyone's pay is on.
**Jmendez**: On hold until they turn in their closeout documents.
**Jmendez**: So some of them started coming in today and hopefully they'll start coming in.
**Bclymer**: And we'll make sure they have the, you know, you give them the right date and everything and update your log.
**Bclymer**: Anything else on bart?
**Bclymer**: No.
**Bclymer**: So they released this.
**Bclymer**: What do you think?
**Bclymer**: So now that we've got to, we gotta do extra work.
**Bclymer**: Do we have a timeline on how long that's going to take us or anything?
**Jmendez**: It depends how long it takes to get the door hardware.
**Jmendez**: That, that's.
**Jmendez**: That'll be the longest lead item.
**Bclymer**: Okay, well, let's figure that out so that we can get a projection.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Anything else?
**Jmendez**: No.
**Bclymer**: Memphis Cold Storage, Phase one.

**Gducharme**: Oh, phase.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, we moved the panel last week.
**Gducharme**: Waiting on the window to come in.
**Gducharme**: I need to send them a bill for the final amount of contingency we used for that work.
**Bclymer**: You have your closeout documents?
**Bclymer**: Already done.
**Gducharme**: Are you wanting me to do closeout documents for phase one?
**Gducharme**: Because they're kind of all together.
**Gducharme**: I just have.
**Gducharme**: I just have Mid South.
**Gducharme**: I'm happy to get that warranty work to put together.
**Bclymer**: I'd probably go ahead and get it from them just to be safe.
**Gducharme**: All right, I'll put that as a task.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, all this guard shack work has been, you know, additional in the last couple weeks, so.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Anything else?
**Gducharme**: Nope.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Spire, Newport, Richey.
**Jmendez**: That one.
**Jmendez**: We just need to turn in our proposal for the cab, the canopy work.
**Bclymer**: Do we have that ready?
**Jmendez**: Yeah, we just needed to need to turn it in.
**Bclymer**: So it's all built and ready to.
**Jmendez**: Be sent the estimates put together.
**Jmendez**: We just need to do a final review and then turn it in.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right, why don't you go ahead and get that and then you and I will review it.
**Ataylor**: Then.
**Bclymer**: Make sure we put a task in there to turn in proposal for canopy work.
**Bclymer**: Anything else, Nick?
**Jmendez**: No, just billing this month and that's it.
**Bclymer**: Billing for the month of May or billing for the month of April?
**Jmendez**: For the month of May.
**Bclymer**: Okay, we're got time on that.
**Bclymer**: It's only the 12th, so.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Goodwill Bloomington.
**Bclymer**: How'd the pre con go?
**Jmendez**: It went fine there.
**Jmendez**: We're good to proceed.
**Bclymer**: Awesome.
**Gducharme**: Nick, I have this.
**Gducharme**: I have this check here in a little.
**Gducharme**: I'll swing by FedEx on my way home and I'll overnight it.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: So the project start early subs that's done, right?
**Ataylor**: All.
**Jmendez**: All the contracts are created.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: What are these tasks down here for?
**Bclymer**: So the permits approved.
**Bclymer**: That can be done.
**Bclymer**: What about this?
**Bclymer**: Fire sprinkler height, Final drawing set show.
**Bclymer**: Fire sprinkler riser.
**Bclymer**: What are these three items down here?
**Jmendez**: Fire sprinkler riser.
**Jmendez**: The.
**Jmendez**: That wasn't required for the permit.
**Jmendez**: So that's something we'll.
**Jmendez**: We'll add when we submit our next drawing set.
**Bclymer**: Okay, what about the other two?
**Bclymer**: Sprinkler height and drawing set.
**Jmendez**: So the final drawing set, I guess is probably the one we submitted to the city.
**Jmendez**: So that.
**Jmendez**: That one's done.
**Jmendez**: Fire sprinkler height.
**Jmendez**: I'm not sure if we.
**Jmendez**: We have an exact height for that.
**Bclymer**: What exactly is it?
**Bclymer**: You mean like what.
**Bclymer**: What height?
**Jmendez**: The heads are on Party City.
**Jmendez**: They.
**Jmendez**: They want the fire sprinklers raised so they.
**Jmendez**: They can.
**Jmendez**: They have more storage space.
**Jmendez**: So we're.
**Jmendez**: We're raising them as high as we can.
**Bclymer**: Okay, and so you just don't know how high that could be yet.
**Jmendez**: Yeah, I.
**Jmendez**: I haven't gone over that with Siemens yet.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Make sure that you assign these items to Nick, please.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: Siva building.
**Bclymer**: So we just had our inspection today passed.
**Bclymer**: So the only item we have open is waiting on release for fire alarm work.
**Bclymer**: And then we'll be pricing up phase two whenever that comes out, hopefully in the next month or so.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: Goodwill office curb cut.
**Bclymer**: Nick?
**Jmendez**: Yeah, it's under review by the city right now.
**Jmendez**: They had a couple comments last week regarding the.
**Jmendez**: The one way drive sources, the two ways, and we responded to that and they added someone new to review it.
**Jmendez**: So that person's looking at it right now.
**Bclymer**: Any idea when we think we might hear something back.
**Jmendez**: No, I'm not sure.
**Ataylor**: Good.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: Westfield Collective.
**Bclymer**: Glenn?
**Gducharme**: Yes.
**Njepson**: I just put an update in there today.
**Njepson**: We had some design updates with the garage doors and the bathrooms, the added bathroom.
**Njepson**: So I sent the instructions out on Friday after around noon to the design team to get going on that.
**Njepson**: Katie chose the bathroom laying out that she wanted to go with and MEPs are working on putting that together.
**Njepson**: The platting was needs to be sent to the owners at By Ashton in snail mail to get them to sign and notarize it.
**Njepson**: He is waiting on Katie or Mike to let them know who's going to sign that, where it needs to go.
**Njepson**: And then ILP city planner said that everything looked good on our ilp.
**Njepson**: They're just waiting for the CDR at this point, but we have completed everything for IOP according to them at this point.
**Bclymer**: And.
**Njepson**: Working on the kitchen design change order in progress for the pricing that I have.
**Bclymer**: What about this kitchen specs and middles?
**Njepson**: Kitchen specs?
**Njepson**: Middles is just a reminder to myself that Daniel sent those in and there's there and I have them in here.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: When are you getting your dumpster gate numbers in?
**Njepson**: I have three guys bidding on it right now into the week they're due.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: Lynn, have you sent anything to Capital City Fence on that?
**Njepson**: Yeah, Capital Good Shepherd Fencing.
**Gducharme**: I was just curious because they did a good job.
**Njepson**: So Rice, Reese.
**Bclymer**: What about.
**Bclymer**: So when are we supposed to get our drawings done so that we can get our wall types from Jeff?
**Njepson**: Our structural steel drawings are do on this Friday and then Jeff's IFC set would be next Friday the 23rd.
**Bclymer**: Okay, let's make sure that we are tracking that in here somewhere.
**Njepson**: So we clearly know right here design dates.
**Njepson**: Tracking design dates.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Njepson**: Structural drawings.
**Njepson**: 5, 16 and then CDR is the last two items to check.
**Njepson**: I cannot freaking remember how to make that checklist.
**Njepson**: The box checklist on the side.
**Bclymer**: Down at the bottom.
**Njepson**: Yeah, well, like when you make a list like open up, open up Maria.
**Njepson**: Tracking design dates there at the bottom.
**Ataylor**: Let me.
**Bclymer**: Let me tell you what to do, Glenn.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, this is what I do.
**Bclymer**: Press print screen on your computer, take a screenshot, paste it into chat GBT and ask the question of how to do it.
**Bclymer**: And it'll walk you right through it.
**Bclymer**: How I taught myself code.
**Ataylor**: Good.
**Bclymer**: Anything else on Collective?
**Njepson**: Just that gas issue, the gas encroachment.
**Njepson**: I got the survey sent off to center Point gas today and that was the last thing they needed.
**Njepson**: They basically needed a profile of where the Gas line and water encroachment would happen.
**Njepson**: So it's under their review.
**Njepson**: They said it could take up to six weeks, but they're going to work with us in the meantime.
**Njepson**: We are going to move forward with ag peers and our foundation and get the parking lot graded out and see how that lays, see if we can get it to pass a proof roll.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Njepson**: If we can get that water line done anytime soon, we are here kind of preparing for in case the gas company says they have to move that gas line or bury it deeper, then at least we can get the elevation, get our water tap done because we know we have to be two feet below.
**Njepson**: So hopefully we can get that done and then we can get our gas line put in across the parking lot and just stub it up so we can move forward with our binder and everything in the parking lot.
**Njepson**: While we're waiting on that, what's going.
**Bclymer**: On with this issue with United saying that they are going to trench across the road versus doing a bore.
**Ataylor**: So they're act pothole but they're not trenching?
**Njepson**: Yeah, I don't, I don't think, I.
**Ataylor**: Don'T think that's pothole because the force minutes to make sure the ground or anything up.
**Njepson**: Are you talking about when they were coming out to, to pothole and look for the other structures that were in the road?
**Bclymer**: Well, I mean, so when I.
**Bclymer**: Somebody told me that United was saying that they were going to trench to run that line across the road to tie in versus doing four pits and boring underneath.
**Bclymer**: Now, potholing is what is in combination typically with boring.
**Bclymer**: Because what you'll do is you'll come out, they'll say, okay, you've got all this shit everywhere and then you'll take a vac truck and you'll pothole to find the actual depth of said pipe so that when you bore it, you know you can avoid it.
**Bclymer**: So are they going to do the bore still and they're just potholing to find existing utilities or.
**Njepson**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: How are they crossing the road to tie in that.
**Njepson**: Yes, that is the plan to do the bore, but we still.
**Njepson**: That's what the gas encroachment is also for too.
**Njepson**: So we need to at least be 24 inches below.
**Njepson**: But there's also apparently two storm or suit or sanitary structures out there in the road and they're in the vicinity of where our bore pit is going to come across the road right now.
**Njepson**: So they're out.
**Njepson**: That's what they were going to go out there and pothole and they weren't going to trench the road exit, but they were going to go out there and have to cut into the asphalt and pothole and locate the depths and where the elevations and where those are at to make sure that we're not going to run right into it when we start crossing the road with our board pit.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Njepson**: Or if we are, we can go under it.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Anything else on Westfield?
**Njepson**: Nothing.
**Njepson**: Nothing pressing that we're not.
**Bclymer**: Are you able to.
**Bclymer**: Are you guys able to get that time lapse camera mounted up somewhere, like on a high pole somewhere?
**Bclymer**: Because right now where it's at on the trailer, it's not going to see.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: When we.
**Njepson**: We're getting ready to move the trailer to the corner here, and then we could probably put a 2x4 or something on the outside and get it up higher.
**Bclymer**: I would say.
**Bclymer**: I would probably.
**Bclymer**: You could probably just go to use the volleyball fence and stub something up there.
**Bclymer**: Especially since it's already got power.
**Bclymer**: You can run extension cord down to somewhere.
**Bclymer**: It's got a light pole that you could do something with.
**Bclymer**: I would say we could do the.
**Njepson**: Light pole out there if you.
**Njepson**: Yeah, the northeast corner.
**Bclymer**: That way.
**Bclymer**: It's sturdy.
**Bclymer**: It's got power.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Just a thought.
**Njepson**: All right, well, Chad heard you.
**Ataylor**: He's.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: Applied Engineering office remodel AJ Yep.
**Gducharme**: We are meeting with them on Thursday to go over final construction documents and scope.
**Bclymer**: Is the CDR submitted?
**Gducharme**: CDR has been submitted.
**Gducharme**: They haven't sent me an approved one yet.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Building owner, property manager, contact info.
**Bclymer**: Do we have that?
**Gducharme**: I do not have it yet.
**Gducharme**: I have reached out to Houston.
**Gducharme**: I haven't followed up with him yet, so I'll follow up with him.
**Gducharme**: I was trying to get access last week.
**Bclymer**: But he would not hook you up with that.
**Ataylor**: Huh.
**Bclymer**: Can the applied folks not hook you up with that contact?
**Gducharme**: They.
**Gducharme**: They probably could.
**Gducharme**: Houston has been the one I've been asking to get access to the site.
**Gducharme**: He's a busy guy.
**Gducharme**: I know, but, you know, I'm gonna have to start that contact with the owner just so they can be involved in all the updates, so.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, plus I'd like to.
**Gducharme**: I'd like to get on the owner's contact list.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, maybe.
**Bclymer**: Maybe something to, you know, again, like you said, Houston's very, very busy.
**Bclymer**: Hard to get a hold of it.
**Bclymer**: May be worth, you know, asking the client, the tenant.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Budget.
**Bclymer**: Obviously you're waiting on the final numbers.
**Ataylor**: Yep.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, I'll enter that in.
**Gducharme**: Job planner.
**Bclymer**: What about this?
**Gducharme**: I just really need to wait to see what hap.
**Gducharme**: What comes of this Thursday meeting.
**Bclymer**: Is this create ads list and price based on 47 meeting complete?
**Gducharme**: That is complete, yes.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Job Planner got it set up?
**Gducharme**: I don't have it in Job Planner yet.
**Gducharme**: No.
**Bclymer**: Send contract to apply.
**Bclymer**: Haven't done that yet either, I take it?
**Gducharme**: Nope.
**Gducharme**: No, I go in and update.
**Gducharme**: So if it's not started, I haven't touched it yet.
**Bclymer**: All right, cool.
**Bclymer**: That job number is wrong too.
**Bclymer**: For Applied Engineering, it should be 125.
**Bclymer**: 105, yep.
**Bclymer**: All right then.
**Bclymer**: Core marks.
**Bclymer**: Done.
**Bclymer**: I just need to get the change order made.
**Bclymer**: Keep in mind that's one of those where the budget's showing wrong.
**Bclymer**: So you need to fix that, Jose.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Aspire Saint Lucie.
**Jmendez**: I just need to verify that we got the final payment, but other than that, we're done.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So you just have one thing.
**Bclymer**: So verify final payment from client.
**Jmendez**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so that's the only task on that one.
**Bclymer**: Maria, please put that on there.
**Adelgado**: Which one?
**Bclymer**: For Aspire St Lucie, the only open task is verify final payment and then close out documents.
**Bclymer**: Have you already done that, Nick?
**Jmendez**: Yeah, I have the closeout documents.
**Bclymer**: Okay, you got them all on a file and organized?
**Jmendez**: Yeah, they're in the folder.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right, so Neiman Holdings.
**Bclymer**: So where are we at on that one?
**Gducharme**: Yep, I logged into my portal today.
**Gducharme**: No news from Carmel on the permit yet.
**Gducharme**: Just waiting on on comments back from them.
**Gducharme**: We've begun the buyout.
**Gducharme**: I have to review all of the contracts.
**Gducharme**: We can start receiving submittals.
**Gducharme**: So we'll get those logged in Job Planner.
**Bclymer**: What?
**Bclymer**: Wait, what's left on buy up?
**Gducharme**: Got.
**Gducharme**: Gotta send them.
**Gducharme**: Send the contracts out.
**Gducharme**: They're all in there in Job Planner.
**Gducharme**: Just need to approve them and send them.
**Bclymer**: Can you get those out this week?
**Gducharme**: Oh, yeah, I was supposed to have it done last week, so.
**Ataylor**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: I got drawing adjustments from DKGR.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, he is currently putting the FedEx scope onto a set for us to include.
**Gducharme**: I went ahead and submitted what we had, but that just had our one line and our landlord work.
**Bclymer**: Okay, when's he supposed to have those updated?
**Gducharme**: Good question.
**Gducharme**: I've been talking to him about other stuff.
**Gducharme**: I haven't.
**Gducharme**: I haven't followed up with him on that.
**Bclymer**: Follow up with him if you could, please.
**Gducharme**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Anything else on Neon?
**Ataylor**: Nope.
**Gducharme**: We.
**Gducharme**: I haven't heard back on the owner contract and we talked about that earlier, so I'll follow up with with Shan and Corey and make sure they don't have any questions.
**Bclymer**: Okay, we're gonna make sure we have a task on there and get on our contract signed.
**Gducharme**: I'll add it right now.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: Danville Theater.
**Gducharme**: Yes, I am waiting on a structural price so we don't have to get a CDR for this work.
**Gducharme**: We will have to submit electrical and plumbing drawings, mainly electrical.
**Gducharme**: And then Bill has talked with the guy who is the one who issues the permit.
**Gducharme**: So I think we'll be able to get a permit fairly quickly.
**Gducharme**: But DKGR is on board for drawing this up for me.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: Once I get a price, I'm.
**Gducharme**: I'm gonna.
**Gducharme**: I'm gonna have to have Bill bite off the design first, and then I'll put money in there for our time and coordination, but having a hard time finding a framer that can price it up without something on paper.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: What about.
**Bclymer**: So that's a reprice for addition of loft.
**Bclymer**: That's where you got to get this up on paper.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, just.
**Gducharme**: Just a floor plan.
**Gducharme**: And I got to know what joist that we have.
**Gducharme**: Have to install there above for that loft.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: What about W9?
**Bclymer**: Do we get one from him?
**Gducharme**: I have not got a W9 from him yet.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So what are the next steps on this?
**Gducharme**: Get approved for the design and, you know, spend 5 to 7k on getting a structural engineer involved and figuring out exactly what size joists we need.
**Gducharme**: And then I can lock in some pricing.
**Bclymer**: What's the.
**Bclymer**: What's the time?
**Bclymer**: I guess you just got to submit a proposal to Bill for the design.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, that's my.
**Gducharme**: That's my plan this week.
**Bclymer**: All right, so let's.
**Bclymer**: Maria, put a task on there.
**Bclymer**: So submit design proposal.
**Bclymer**: And then when do you think you do that?
**Gducharme**: I'll get something to them this week.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: You both are typing the same thing.
**Bclymer**: That's okay.
**Gducharme**: Sorry, Maria.
**Gducharme**: I'll let you do it.
**Adelgado**: It's okay.
**Adelgado**: Proposal.
**Adelgado**: When?
**Adelgado**: I put high priority on that, too.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.

**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: So that's still in a holding pattern.
**Bclymer**: We still have not heard back from the city on what they're doing, so no real movement there.
**Bclymer**: Port Collective.
**Bclymer**: Andres, how you coming on the drawing today?
**Jdawson**: I will send you today the drawing.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: That's kind of the biggest thing.
**Bclymer**: And then, Marie, we need a task for the Georgia GC license.
**Bclymer**: Start tracking on where we're at on that Collective.

**Adelgado**: So this is your right, Andres.
**Bclymer**: Updated estimate, not drawings.
**Bclymer**: When do you have those numbers due, Andres?
**Jdawson**: I think so the next Monday.
**Bclymer**: Next Monday.

**Ataylor**: I don't.
**Gducharme**: Have you chatted with him recently?
**Bclymer**: No, not about.
**Bclymer**: Not about the job.
**Gducharme**: Okay, well, I'm assuming it's still a thing.
**Gducharme**: I know that they're going through an audit.

**Gducharme**: In our weekly meeting, so I.
**Gducharme**: I don't know.
**Gducharme**: I don't know how hard to press.
**Gducharme**: I know that the electricians were blowing me up, saying that we may lose some.
**Gducharme**: Some line, some, like, part in the queue from mlgw.
**Gducharme**: And then I responded, and they said we should be okay for a little.
**Gducharme**: So I'll bring up tomorrow if we meet.
**Gducharme**: I'll bring up some urgency there.
**Gducharme**: Do we know where we're at with our side of the license?
**Bclymer**: We're finishing up the audit.
**Bclymer**: Should be done in the next day or two, so.
**Gducharme**: That's awesome.
**Gducharme**: That's awesome.
**Gducharme**: Well, we don't have to go in front of the board for that, do we?
**Bclymer**: No.
**Gducharme**: That'D be huge.
**Gducharme**: So I can start pushing on it here in a couple weeks?

**Gducharme**: Well, I got everybody lined up.
**Gducharme**: Everybody's ready to start the work.
**Gducharme**: Pricing's there.

**Gducharme**: Yes.
**Gducharme**: I sent our updated price in for that and I should get approval because they were pushing, which I was able to notice the bus that we have.
**Gducharme**: And so once we get that budget and they're okay with.
**Gducharme**: With numbers, I'll start to buy out with that one and the one that's just about two miles down the road out there in Springfield.
**Gducharme**: So.
**Bclymer**: Okay, what about.

**Bclymer**: We checked into that.
**Gducharme**: I checked into it.
**Gducharme**: Yep.

**Bclymer**: So we have our fixed pricing in.
**Gducharme**: No, that's what I need.
**Gducharme**: I need to send it out for hard pricing and lock in subs.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: What are you going to have that do by?
**Gducharme**: I won't have it do until from subs.
**Gducharme**: Middle of next week.

**Gducharme**: Team on site last week.
**Gducharme**: They sent us digital files.
**Gducharme**: I played around with the layout a little bit this weekend.
**Gducharme**: But Andreas, when you get a little less covered, you and I should get together and come up with some ideas to see how many parking spots we can fit on there.
**Gducharme**: I mean, it's going to be hard to get more than 22.
**Gducharme**: Brandon.
**Gducharme**: I was just playing around with boxes.
**Gducharme**: You can see my notes if you.
**Gducharme**: If you look in the drawings there.

**Bclymer**: So that can get changed up.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, perfect.
**Bclymer**: Great clips, Madison.
**Gducharme**: I sent them a budget for that.
**Gducharme**: So they're not gonna like the price because I, you know, I put in our.
**Gducharme**: Our travel time there, but at least gives, you know, helps them out.
**Gducharme**: Didn't take me long.
**Bclymer**: So did you confirm the GC requirements?
**Gducharme**: I didn't confirm any GC requirements yet and I told them that in the email.
**Gducharme**: I said I'm still waiting to figure that out, but this should be something to help them keep moving the deal along, which is the ultimate goal.
**Bclymer**: About this R D group.
**Gducharme**: That'S paused.
**Gducharme**: I don't.
**Gducharme**: I don't know how you can not show the paused ones.
**Gducharme**: That's the deal with Houston Below Applied Engineering.

**Adelgado**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: That.
**Gducharme**: That job's de.

**Bclymer**: When do you have numbers coming back from the subs?
**Jdawson**: Okay, I will check that.
**Bclymer**: That was a question.
**Jdawson**: No, I didn't check this project.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right, so Maria put a task in there for Andres to confirm or get updated pricing from subs.
**Bclymer**: So put that due on Thursday.
**Bclymer**: And so find out what.
**Bclymer**: What they're looking at and then you can come in here and update when you should be getting those.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Oh, Goodwill foundations, Glenn.
**Njepson**: We got the pricing and budget for them and split out some costs they could pay out of two different buckets.
**Njepson**: We sent that pricing back on Wednesday, followed up with them today, and they were not ready to move forward yet.
**Njepson**: It says standby, Jake.
**Bclymer**: So the estimate's done, correct?
**Ataylor**: Mm.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And then a shot permit set.
**Ataylor**: Do we have that?
**Njepson**: No, we're not.
**Njepson**: We're not releasing them until Goodwill gives.
**Njepson**: Confirms that they're going to move forward with the project.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And Then finish drawing from walk.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Assuming that that's already done.
**Njepson**: Yeah, yeah, that's probably.
**Njepson**: That's probably done at this point.
**Bclymer**: Goodwill Sloan re Roof turning.
**Bclymer**: Roofing numbers.
**Bclymer**: Andres, did we get our roofing numbers?

**Gducharme**: Yeah, I chatted with Jake actually today.
**Gducharme**: So he's sent the deal to Longhorn.
**Gducharme**: He's moving forward with it.
**Gducharme**: So they have a real estate committee with corporate and he's going to wait until June.
**Gducharme**: I think 20th is when they get together.
**Gducharme**: And if they approve the deal, then he's full bore.
**Jmendez**: So.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, we just.
**Gducharme**: When the time comes, you know, it's on the back burner.
**Gducharme**: But we gotta try to get in in his number and it's our job, so.
**Bclymer**: Well, once they accept the deal, they're going through with the job no matter what.
**Bclymer**: So if the guy has to make 900, 000 instead of a million, he's not going to lose the job.
**Gducharme**: I.
**Gducharme**: I know he's going through with it no matter what, but I think we'll have some.
**Gducharme**: Like.
**Gducharme**: He'll.
**Gducharme**: He'll then get with Ashton and actually start putting some documents together.
**Gducharme**: He'll get a geotech done and we'll have some more clarification on what we actually need to do when we demo that.
