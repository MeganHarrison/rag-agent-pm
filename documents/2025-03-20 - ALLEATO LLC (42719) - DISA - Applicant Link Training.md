## Transcript
**Mcalcetero**: Foreign.
**Mcalcetero**: Let's just wait for Brandon to join because unfortunately I cannot log into the other.
**Mcalcetero**: You go.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Are you guys able to see my screen?
**Mcalcetero**: Yes.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay.
**Mcalcetero**: Oh, but this is from Venture.
**Mcalcetero**: Oh, nice.
**Mcalcetero**: So.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay, go ahead.
**Bclymer**: No.
**Bclymer**: Do you have any questions or anything?
**Mcalcetero**: No, no.
**Mcalcetero**: I was thinking that.
**Mcalcetero**: I was thinking if we are going to do the background checks, we can do it from the Venture application.
**Mcalcetero**: Or it has to be with disa or is it already connected there?
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: So it has the capability of doing the single sign on through Prism.
**Bclymer**: I noticed that your email in Prism is different than the one that DISA has.
**Mcalcetero**: Yes.
**Mcalcetero**: Connected with Brian.
**Mcalcetero**: Because I couldn't log into DISA because I'm in Colombia.
**Mcalcetero**: So that's why.
**Bclymer**: Oh.
**Bclymer**: So I'm wondering if they'll let you.
**Bclymer**: But.
**Bclymer**: But both your email in Prism is different so they're not going to be able to sync together.
**Bclymer**: But if you have that capability or if you, if both emails match, then you could go ahead and.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Do it that way as well.
**Mcalcetero**: What do you mean?
**Speaker 2**: Are you saying her email in prison.
**Bclymer**: Is different than the one in Visa in the DISA account?
**Speaker 2**: Okay, so this is my email.
**Mcalcetero**: Correct.
**Speaker 2**: Okay, that's fine.
**Speaker 2**: So she can, she can log in under my account.
**Mcalcetero**: Correct.
**Mcalcetero**: So what I can do is instead of using login to priest with my credentials, I can use Brandon's credentials and go ahead and do the background checks.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Or you could have.
**Bclymer**: You.
**Bclymer**: Would you be able to go into your own account?
**Bclymer**: I think you can.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah.
**Mcalcetero**: I tried to log into Disa but because it says the link doesn't work internationally so I couldn't log in with the process.
**Mcalcetero**: That's why.
**Mcalcetero**: But we can check that later.
**Mcalcetero**: It's okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, the setup process.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, it won't let you.
**Bclymer**: But I don't know if you're.
**Bclymer**: Once you're set up, if, if you could.
**Mcalcetero**: Gotcha.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: But if you were to be in Prism, you could go into my employees here and then HR View and then there's Scrim Check.
**Bclymer**: It used to formally be known as scrimcheck but now it's called.
**Bclymer**: Now it's called disa.
**Bclymer**: Or you can go into the search bar and go ahead and click on it and it'll take you straight to it.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So on the dashboard you could go ahead and move the boxes around.
**Bclymer**: Any updates that DISA might have, they'll be right.
**Bclymer**: Here are your orders for the month, week, year, they're all going to be listed here.
**Bclymer**: If you wanted to do a quick order, you could go to the Create Applicant Link request and go in here, pick your packages, whichever package you want and then go and make your order.
**Bclymer**: We usually go into on the left hand side.
**Bclymer**: If you go down to Applicant Link or you go to Create request and have you thought of what packages you're.
**Bclymer**: What package?
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, I think it was suggested number 10 or 3.
**Mcalcetero**: I think there's like 3.
**Mcalcetero**: It's like even like cheaper with just a $6 plus something else different.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so you'll go ahead and pick package 10.
**Bclymer**: Are you guys doing any direct screens or just background screens?
**Speaker 2**: Background.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay, can we do one with you already?
**Mcalcetero**: Rosa, we have two employees coming soon and maybe it will be nice to check if we can do it with one already.
**Mcalcetero**: Like we can.
**Mcalcetero**: Can we just order the pac?
**Bclymer**: You can.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so then I'm going to go ahead and just pick a three for now forms.
**Bclymer**: And the reason why we use the Applicant link is to be in compliance and make sure that the DISA usually has the most up to date compliance consent forms or authorization forms that the candidate will need to fill out.
**Bclymer**: That's why we always have.
**Bclymer**: That's why we always use the Applicant link.
**Bclymer**: You could go ahead and modify this to how many days you want.
**Bclymer**: It's default for seven days.
**Bclymer**: You could go ahead and add a note here and all you need is a first, last name email address of the candidate.
**Bclymer**: Not a lot of clients, but some will go ahead and put them in the prison system before they run their screenings.
**Bclymer**: You have the capability to go ahead and import the data from Prism over here on the right hand side, upper right hand side.
**Bclymer**: And then you could go ahead and search for the candidate or go ahead and scroll down to where their name is and then you would just import it and then it would put their information here.
**Bclymer**: Gotcha.
**Bclymer**: But if you don't have that, then all you need is first name, last name and their email address.
**Bclymer**: You could also go ahead and send them an email, I mean sorry, a text.
**Bclymer**: And if you have their number, you could go ahead and add it here, but if not, then a email is required.
**Bclymer**: Okay, perfect.
**Bclymer**: If if you're gonna go ahead and place the order for the same, the same type of package for the all.
**Bclymer**: Like let's say you have five or how you mentioned you have two.
**Bclymer**: You could go here and add it instead of going back and forth and doing the same first step over, you can go ahead and add it here.
**Bclymer**: Once you go ahead and you don't have to worry about anything with the billing part and then just agree to the terms and conditions and submit.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so that's all you need.
**Bclymer**: They'll go ahead and get the link.
**Bclymer**: They get a notification, I think every 24 hours.
**Bclymer**: Whoever placed the order will get a notification.
**Bclymer**: Once the candidate completes their order, I mean there are consent forms and then once the screening is complete, the report is complete.
**Mcalcetero**: Once the consent forms are completed, we receive a notification on Prism, on Prisma or where this.
**Bclymer**: In an email.
**Bclymer**: You'll receive an email notification if anything.
**Mcalcetero**: Looks suspicious or anything like they didn't.
**Mcalcetero**: I mean they complete the consent forms and everything.
**Mcalcetero**: But for, I don't know, let's say for example, criminal background.
**Mcalcetero**: So will the platform let us know about it or how can we.
**Bclymer**: Yes, well, it would just let you know that the report's complete.
**Bclymer**: And then you would go in here, let me go ahead and just finish this little part right here.
**Bclymer**: So if you go to the left hand side, go to View request, all your orders are going to be right here that you placed.
**Bclymer**: It's not going to generate the order ID yet until the candidate completes the their consent forms.
**Bclymer**: Once it does, you could go ahead and click on it and it'll have a list.
**Bclymer**: But before I go into that view, orders, let's say the candidate says for some reason there was a typo on their email or anything like that, you could go ahead and remove the candidate or if they decide not to move forward, you could go ahead and remove it or it just expires, extend the expiration date or reset the email in case they didn't receive it for some reason.
**Bclymer**: You could go ahead and reset the email and then I'm going to go ahead and click on View.
**Bclymer**: So this is what they're going to be receiving with your company's name here and then their deadline.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so once they complete their consent forms, you could go into screenings, view orders and then.
**Bclymer**: So any yellows is going to be that they're still pending, they're still processing.
**Bclymer**: If I scroll down, it's going to show you real time here, what the status is for each thing.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: C means green.
**Bclymer**: It's clear.
**Bclymer**: Everything came out right.
**Bclymer**: And if you see any cues or reds that's questionable, that's a questionable result.
**Bclymer**: I'm going to go ahead and click on this one.
**Bclymer**: So this one, their Social Security number was.
**Bclymer**: Something was wrong.
**Bclymer**: Either they don't have a lot of residential history.
**Bclymer**: Depending on how old the candidate is, if they're like an 18 year old or 19 year old, you know, and they live with their parents, they might not have that.
**Bclymer**: That Residential history.
**Bclymer**: But let me go ahead and click on.
**Bclymer**: I was going to check on another example but let me go into the actual report so you're able to see it.
**Bclymer**: So this is what's going to, this is going to show the report here.
**Bclymer**: All the consent forms are going to be down here.
**Bclymer**: This one was in a set up that way but other consent forms were to be on the bottom here.
**Bclymer**: And then what was ran and then let's say for example, if they're taking a long time for results to come in, you could email us and we could notify disa or you could go in here and go into the contact customer and then either ask them any questions that you might have on a report or status update or ETA and then they usually respond within an hour.
**Bclymer**: They're pretty quick about that.
**Bclymer**: You mentioned about a questionable report.
**Bclymer**: Another feature that this has is the adverse action and this is just like letting them know that you don't want to move forward, you know, based on their results and it'll list the, you know, any criminal record that they have or anything like that.
**Bclymer**: Let me just click on one of them and this is.
**Bclymer**: And you could go ahead and trigger this and it gives them about five days and then they'll send them the letter saying that you regret to inform that you know, you're not going to moving forward with your employment.
**Mcalcetero**: So Rosa, that's for example, those parameters are coming from us or that's like a default that they're going to receive if any.
**Bclymer**: No, that.
**Bclymer**: That's.
**Bclymer**: You would have to initiate the abras action for it.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: For.
**Bclymer**: For the candidate to receive it.
**Bclymer**: But that, yeah, that all would depend on, you know, looking at the results and then seeing if you want to move forward with them or not.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay, makes sense.
**Bclymer**: So the average action and the support thing, I think those are the two main things that I wanted to share with you besides print the report.
**Bclymer**: You could go ahead and print it here or download it it and then save it into their profile in Prism or you know, save it in their file if you have a.
**Bclymer**: For that particular candidate.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah.
**Mcalcetero**: Folder.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And that it's it, that's.
**Bclymer**: It's very user friendly and like I mentioned, like all you need is the first last name of the candidate and their email address.
**Bclymer**: And if they want or if you want you could go ahead and also at their mobile number.
**Mcalcetero**: So this is already active.
**Mcalcetero**: Right.
**Mcalcetero**: So if I just want to go ahead right now to Prisma and just go ahead and send it to our new coming employees, we'll Be good to go.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: If you want, you can log in and I could walk you through it.
**Bclymer**: I could stop sharing my screen.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, we can do that.
**Mcalcetero**: Brandon, do you want to stay?
**Mcalcetero**: I don't think you need to stay.
**Mcalcetero**: I can just do it with the Rosa.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, you do it.
**Speaker 2**: The only question I had is we.
**Speaker 2**: We only pay.
**Speaker 2**: We pay per person, right?
**Mcalcetero**: Yes.
**Mcalcetero**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Cool.
**Bclymer**: Thank you.
**Mcalcetero**: So just so you know, we're sending this to criminal checks right now to Jack and Ken.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay.
**Mcalcetero**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: And then another.
**Bclymer**: Another thing that I wanted to mention about the billing is you'll get it, like, at the beginning of the, you know, the.
**Bclymer**: The next month for any services that you have in March.
**Bclymer**: You'll get billed in your payroll invoice the first week of April.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Mcalcetero**: Perfect.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay, Brandon, you can leave.
**Mcalcetero**: Thank you.
**Mcalcetero**: I'm just gonna move on with Ross.
**Mcalcetero**: Thank you.
**Mcalcetero**: So let me.
**Mcalcetero**: You know, so I'm just gonna go ahead and share my screen with you.
**Mcalcetero**: So let's do it together really quick.
**Mcalcetero**: I'm actually a quick learner.
**Mcalcetero**: I just want to make sure I'm doing it right because this is important.
**Mcalcetero**: So let me share my screen.
**Mcalcetero**: And since I have access to one second first.
**Mcalcetero**: If I have access to that, to cream check.
**Mcalcetero**: If not all that's right away information.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay.
**Mcalcetero**: So you said it's under my employees.
**Mcalcetero**: And then frame check.
**Mcalcetero**: One second.
**Mcalcetero**: I don't think I'm gonna have it.
**Mcalcetero**: So.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah.
**Mcalcetero**: Oh, no, I do have it.
**Mcalcetero**: Frame check.
**Mcalcetero**: HR view.
**Mcalcetero**: One second again, I'm not sure in my screen, but let me check window.
**Mcalcetero**: It's one.
**Mcalcetero**: I think it's loading.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And right now.
**Bclymer**: I requested them in this morning for the IT team to go ahead and have TMB to be able to.
**Bclymer**: It's not going to let you.
**Bclymer**: I think it's.
**Bclymer**: Oh, well, yeah, go ahead and see if you could go in there.
**Mcalcetero**: I don't think I can.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: No, not yet.
**Bclymer**: Mine is still showing like a blue white screen because it needs to open up that access, so I'm waiting on them.
**Bclymer**: So once you're.
**Bclymer**: And it's showing a blue screen also because I think your email address on your account.
**Bclymer**: I don't think it's.
**Bclymer**: I thought I.
**Bclymer**: I thought I was.
**Mcalcetero**: Well, no, it's random.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So that might need to be if.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, he might have.
**Bclymer**: I might need to request you your own.
**Mcalcetero**: Well, I can log into Hayes.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Mcalcetero**: I just need his password and then that's able.
**Mcalcetero**: Let me see if you can have it right now.
**Mcalcetero**: Send me a range for password and Send the code to email so I can access it.
**Mcalcetero**: One second, girls.
**Mcalcetero**: I will see.
**Mcalcetero**: I think.
**Mcalcetero**: I think probably it's going to be like.
**Bclymer**: I don't see Brandon as one of the users for.
**Mcalcetero**: Oh no, he's like.
**Mcalcetero**: He should actually have like everything.
**Bclymer**: Okay, let me go ahead and share my screen real quick.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, go ahead.
**Bclymer**: So I have Dustin, Daniel or any of these his.
**Mcalcetero**: Interesting.
**Mcalcetero**: So let me think.
**Mcalcetero**: So this has sent us an email, but let me check something.
**Bclymer**: I'm sorry.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So I'm gonna have to go to another.
**Mcalcetero**: We are excited to have you on board.
**Mcalcetero**: On team on board.
**Mcalcetero**: To log in and get a star visit the iFish client portal.
**Mcalcetero**: You want to use your username and password you created during account registration.
**Mcalcetero**: You'll find your iFage welcome or attached.
**Mcalcetero**: So if I go to iFage.com I can do it by.
**Mcalcetero**: By like right there.
**Mcalcetero**: But the idea will be to have actually like you said, to have connection with Prism.
**Mcalcetero**: Prisma.
**Mcalcetero**: Prism with Prisma.
**Mcalcetero**: Because it'll be actually faster and easier for us just to go to Prisma.
**Mcalcetero**: And then it seems that he register like he's.
**Mcalcetero**: I mean we received the registration letter.
**Bclymer**: From D.
**Bclymer**: Yes, but let me go into.
**Bclymer**: Where are you?
**Bclymer**: There you are, Sonia.
**Bclymer**: See it has.
**Bclymer**: It has your email address.
**Mcalcetero**: Sonia.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So this email needs to match security.
**Bclymer**: Oh, I had to log in.
**Bclymer**: I had to go into a different.
**Mcalcetero**: Gotcha.
**Bclymer**: Going to user.
**Bclymer**: So once it is able to open up the access into both systems.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, I see.
**Bclymer**: Because I mean this email needs to.
**Bclymer**: They need a match.
**Bclymer**: So this email needs to match with this email and then once they.
**Mcalcetero**: So they're not matching.
**Mcalcetero**: Right.
**Mcalcetero**: Because this one is at the insurance.
**Bclymer**: And it was Gmail and the other one's your personal email.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So if you want to go ahead but if you don't want to go ahead and change anything, just leave it the way it is.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: You would have to go into Brandon's and then go into it that way.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay.
**Mcalcetero**: You can just reply to me.
**Mcalcetero**: So let me just go ahead and try to.
**Mcalcetero**: Let's try it.
**Mcalcetero**: Maybe.
**Mcalcetero**: Maybe he's connected on Venture.
**Mcalcetero**: I don't know if I have to do something.
**Bclymer**: I don't know because I didn't see him in the security list.
**Bclymer**: But that, that'll mean we can't.
**Bclymer**: We can't add him like April.
**Bclymer**: I could get with April and have him.
**Mcalcetero**: How can we.
**Mcalcetero**: How can we add them?
**Mcalcetero**: Like, because it's supposed to be there.
**Bclymer**: I could check with April and ask her.
**Bclymer**: She's your.
**Bclymer**: Is it payroll?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: She's your payroll rep.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, One second.
**Mcalcetero**: So we have Glimmer the clever is a username.
**Mcalcetero**: One second.
**Mcalcetero**: So, okay, so email to send security code.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay, so I'm, I'm logging to Venture.
**Mcalcetero**: Let's see.
**Mcalcetero**: To prison Prisma.
**Mcalcetero**: We'll see if we can, you know, get access to.
**Bclymer**: It should bring up like a blue white screen.
**Bclymer**: It would say Prism customer options are invalid.
**Bclymer**: But that's just because I'm waiting for it to.
**Mcalcetero**: But let's see if that happens because actually, I mean, if he used his same email.
**Mcalcetero**: Because we always use our email.
**Mcalcetero**: So cream check.
**Mcalcetero**: Right, so this is Cream check.
**Mcalcetero**: It's logging.
**Mcalcetero**: No, it is.
**Mcalcetero**: We're already there.
**Mcalcetero**: One second.
**Mcalcetero**: So let me share with you.
**Mcalcetero**: Window and then.
**Bclymer**: Oh, good.
**Mcalcetero**: So we're here.
**Mcalcetero**: You see from the camera.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, so that's good.
**Mcalcetero**: That's awesome.
**Mcalcetero**: So why would it.
**Bclymer**: Anyway, maybe I have to refresh my.
**Bclymer**: I think because I submitted it this morning, so it's okay.
**Mcalcetero**: All right, so we're gonna have two people coming.
**Mcalcetero**: But the thing is, is it preferable to send them the criminal background to their personal emails or the company?
**Mcalcetero**: But that's the thing, though.
**Mcalcetero**: I mean the idea will be send it out before they come to the to work.
**Mcalcetero**: So, okay, so you said we're gonna do applicant link.
**Mcalcetero**: Right.
**Mcalcetero**: And then create request.
**Mcalcetero**: And then you say we have to go to package.
**Mcalcetero**: We're gonna choose package number three.
**Mcalcetero**: Multi count.
**Bclymer**: It's gonna be.
**Mcalcetero**: And then you said seven days until expire.
**Mcalcetero**: And we're gonna say like, hi, this is.
**Mcalcetero**: Oh, please complete this background screening.
**Mcalcetero**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: You could put any comment you want.
**Bclymer**: But it's also going to do that template that I showed you.
**Bclymer**: It's still going to have that information.
**Mcalcetero**: We don't need it.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so that's if you wanted to add something.
**Mcalcetero**: Gotcha.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay.
**Mcalcetero**: Default template.
**Mcalcetero**: Right?
**Mcalcetero**: We leave it like that.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Mcalcetero**: And then the first name, you said that I need to add another applicant.
**Mcalcetero**: So first name will be.
**Mcalcetero**: This is Jack Corking.
**Mcalcetero**: And then the email address.
**Mcalcetero**: Well, I have to send it to your personal.
**Mcalcetero**: So let me send this to Jack.
**Mcalcetero**: Jack Courting.
**Bclymer**: Jesus Christ.
**Bclymer**: And if you have it like saved on your somewhere, you could just copy and paste it.
**Bclymer**: That's usually what I do because some people's emails are so long and I know typing in at Gmail or email.
**Mcalcetero**: Ken Johnson.
**Mcalcetero**: And then let me just add Ken right now here.
**Mcalcetero**: And then we're going to go see Skip.
**Mcalcetero**: I can.
**Mcalcetero**: This is his email.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay, so we have these two phone number.
**Mcalcetero**: We don't need it right now.
**Mcalcetero**: Sentiment.
**Mcalcetero**: We don't need to Barkel.
**Mcalcetero**: And then create applicant link request.
**Mcalcetero**: I agree.
**Bclymer**: Gonna agree.
**Bclymer**: And then send.
**Bclymer**: And if you go over to the to view request.
**Bclymer**: View requests on the left, they're right there.
**Bclymer**: And if you scroll over to the right a little bit more then you're gonna.
**Bclymer**: You could go ahead and do.
**Bclymer**: Do any changes to that order to that where.
**Bclymer**: Sorry, that link.
**Bclymer**: If you scroll the little bar.
**Bclymer**: The little scroll bar over to the right hand side.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: You can move it over.
**Mcalcetero**: Which one?
**Bclymer**: This one on the bottom.
**Mcalcetero**: Oh, quick order.
**Mcalcetero**: This one.
**Bclymer**: No, no, on the, on the bottom where the, where the bar is where you can move it over to the right.
**Mcalcetero**: I don't see it.
**Mcalcetero**: I'm sorry.
**Mcalcetero**: So I was here.
**Bclymer**: That dark bar on the bottom.
**Mcalcetero**: The dark.
**Mcalcetero**: Oh, this one.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: So sorry.
**Mcalcetero**: Makes sense.
**Bclymer**: Then over on the options, you could go ahead and resend it or anything like that.
**Mcalcetero**: Gotcha.
**Bclymer**: You could click on that and do that and then once they complete it then it'll be an order ID and then you could go into screenings on the left hand side.
**Mcalcetero**: Yes.
**Mcalcetero**: And then check view orders and then make sure like the ID will be created here.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Once they complete those forms, they'll be right there.
**Bclymer**: Everything.
**Bclymer**: And then you could click on in it and it'll be all the status will be real time.
**Mcalcetero**: Awesome.
**Mcalcetero**: And then if for payment and everything.
**Mcalcetero**: Because we're already.
**Mcalcetero**: How do you call it?
**Mcalcetero**: We already did like a package we already requested is already added right.
**Mcalcetero**: To.
**Mcalcetero**: For the next.
**Mcalcetero**: You said for the next payment.
**Mcalcetero**: I mean for the next.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: You're not going to get charged if, if you.
**Bclymer**: If they canceled, like let's say they didn't move forward with completing their consent forms.
**Bclymer**: It's not going to charge you unless the report is ran.
**Bclymer**: Then it will.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so for that package three is going to be 21.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay.
**Mcalcetero**: And then outburst action.
**Mcalcetero**: Because nobody has already submitted everything once I can create one.
**Mcalcetero**: Right?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So if you go back into.
**Bclymer**: It would be in the actual screening order in the actual report on the right hand side on the bottom there's going to be a little square that says average action.
**Bclymer**: And that would send it to that particular candidate.
**Mcalcetero**: Average action.
**Mcalcetero**: And then.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay here.
**Bclymer**: No, it's going to like it's going to be inside the report like in the report one.
**Mcalcetero**: Oh, I see.
**Mcalcetero**: So it should be on the viewers candidates.
**Bclymer**: On.
**Bclymer**: On the candidates.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, on the.
**Bclymer**: Let me, let me, let me, let me go ahead.
**Mcalcetero**: Of course, go ahead.
**Mcalcetero**: Thank you, Rosa.
**Bclymer**: Let me go ahead and Sign out of this one because it's gonna.
**Bclymer**: I'm glad you were able to get in there.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Mcalcetero**: Because yeah, we.
**Mcalcetero**: When you said that I was like he always use his email.
**Mcalcetero**: So I was like, I'm sure he's connected.
**Bclymer**: So here's the pending place this week.
**Bclymer**: I'm just gonna go.
**Bclymer**: So here's one, right?
**Mcalcetero**: That's right.
**Bclymer**: Oh, it's still pending.
**Bclymer**: So in the.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, so that way it would.
**Bclymer**: You'll just scroll down to ever section.
**Bclymer**: I don't.
**Bclymer**: Oh, maybe because this was not complete.
**Bclymer**: Let me go into a completed one.
**Mcalcetero**: Or maybe the questionable ones.
**Mcalcetero**: Maybe if you need to take an action.
**Mcalcetero**: Or.
**Bclymer**: Let me just go into a completed one and then it would be right here.
**Bclymer**: Our section.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, because I think it's a request.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So you could just click on it and it's going to list here, this little section right here, the items that first, you know, if there's criminal report it's.
**Bclymer**: They're all going to be listed here and then you just click off each one and then just proceed with.
**Bclymer**: Why isn't it letting me.
**Mcalcetero**: So the advert, the adverse action would already tell them the notice that the company want to move forward.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay, so that's.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay, makes sense.
**Bclymer**: Let me go into one that's already sent.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So yes.
**Bclymer**: And they'll have the list of the.
**Bclymer**: The.
**Bclymer**: The report, the reasons why.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, because I think if you go into view, see these are the ones that were ran.
**Bclymer**: I think whenever you go into average action, these are going to be the ones that you've sent.
**Mcalcetero**: Makes sense.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so yeah, just going to the actual report.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay, perfect.
**Mcalcetero**: Rosa, thank you so much.
**Mcalcetero**: That was super easy for me to understand and to go through.
**Mcalcetero**: So now I know from each new employee I'm just going to connect it to that and then send it out.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay, thank you so much.
**Bclymer**: I had a quick question.
**Bclymer**: If you wanted to save the report, like for example, if this one you wanted to download it and save it, do you know how would you want to save it into the employee's profile in Prism.
**Mcalcetero**: No, to be honest, we have like a personal folder for each of our employees under OneDrive.
**Mcalcetero**: So I prefer to download those documents because if somebody for example lose the access on Prisma or anything.
**Mcalcetero**: So at least the documents are still in the OneDrive.
**Mcalcetero**: So it already.
**Mcalcetero**: I mean the HR people can see it.
**Mcalcetero**: So yeah, we don't want it there, to be honest.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Mcalcetero**: But thank you so much.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Because I was going to just show you like where to go and stuff.
**Mcalcetero**: But yeah, but the thing.
**Mcalcetero**: And I was thinking about that, too, and I was thinking, since I'm sending them to their personal emails, it won't be connected to their corporate email on Prisma.
**Mcalcetero**: So I was like, no, it's fine.
**Mcalcetero**: Let's just download.
**Mcalcetero**: Exactly.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Mcalcetero**: Thank you, Rosa.
**Mcalcetero**: Have a wonderful.
**Mcalcetero**: Have a good day.
**Mcalcetero**: Bye.
