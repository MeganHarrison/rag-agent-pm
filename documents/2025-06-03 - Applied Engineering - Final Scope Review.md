## Transcript
**Dmiles**: Good morning.
**Mlehman**: Good morning.
**Dmiles**: How are you doing?
**Mlehman**: Doing well, thanks.
**Mlehman**: I think there's one more joining us.
**Mlehman**: Appreciate you getting scheduled to us.
**Dmiles**: Yeah, yeah, there's a.
**Dmiles**: I threw it together pretty quick.
**Dmiles**: There's.
**Dmiles**: There's a couple flaws in there I'm noticing, but we'll.
**Dmiles**: After today, this gives you a general idea.
**Dmiles**: I'm.
**Dmiles**: I'm expecting three months, and I'll lock in some inspection dates.
**Dmiles**: And there's a little issue with a little bit of the logic after going through it.
**Dmiles**: But in general, this.
**Dmiles**: This gives you a good idea.
**Mlehman**: It does.
**Mlehman**: So, yeah.
**Mlehman**: Completion around.
**Mlehman**: Yeah.
**Mlehman**: Just right at three months.
**Mlehman**: September 11th start.
**Mlehman**: Six.
**Mlehman**: Nine.
**Dmiles**: Yeah.
**Dmiles**: So I have.
**Dmiles**: I have.
**Dmiles**: I have six days of mobilization.
**Dmiles**: That seems like a lot, but that gives me time.
**Dmiles**: I'm putting our contract together, but that gives me time to put my subcontracts and get those out the door and get guys lined up.
**Dmiles**: So really, we're two weeks from starting, so I'm thinking like the week of the 16th is when we would start.
**Mlehman**: Okay, that's good to know.
**Mlehman**: What we've been doing here is we cleared out the library.
**Mlehman**: There's a wall of shelves and books right.
**Mlehman**: On one of the demo walls.
**Mlehman**: We.
**Mlehman**: We've boxed that up and cleared that out.
**Mlehman**: And then we have next Tuesday, the big conference room getting taken out and stored.
**Mlehman**: So we are making moves here to get, you know, the space cleared up for you.
**Mlehman**: Perfect.
**Mlehman**: That demo starting on the 17th is fine.
**Mlehman**: We will be ready by then.
**Dmiles**: Yeah.
**Dmiles**: So that first day, we'll.
**Lhoran**: We'll.
**Dmiles**: We'll fill in those doors or those.
**Dmiles**: Those openings.
**Dmiles**: Yeah, we'll be out of your hair.
**Dmiles**: And.
**Dmiles**: And the way I have the logic on.
**Dmiles**: On this is we'll get everything done, and then the last thing we'll do is remove that protection wall.
**Dmiles**: And then we'll have some time.
**Dmiles**: We'll put zip wall up or something where we have to tie in the finishes.
**Dmiles**: So that's the axiom.
**Dmiles**: Trim on the ceiling, flooring, and then patching where we remove that wall, and then we should be good to go.
**Dmiles**: We'll take down the zip wall and do our final inspection.
**Mlehman**: Okay.
**Mlehman**: The window coming out for demo.
**Mlehman**: Have you cleared that with the landlord yet?
**Dmiles**: I have not cleared it with the landlord yet.
**Dmiles**: I reached out to her last week.
**Dmiles**: I spoke with Houston, too.
**Dmiles**: Kind of like priority number one for me is.
**Dmiles**: Is getting with her to get everything set up.
**Dmiles**: Alex is going to be our super on it, so I wanted to get him involved with the conversation and meet her.
**Dmiles**: And so we'll we'll get all that handled here now that we're ramping up.
**Mlehman**: Okay.
**Mlehman**: Do you see our comment about the controls?
**Mlehman**: We're gonna have DDC controls.
**Mlehman**: There's no way to tie into pneumatic.
**Mlehman**: So.
**Dmiles**: Yeah, there was some confusion on that and I want to make sure I pull up my notes here.
**Dmiles**: So I want to make sure I have this scope right and I can and I, I think I do now after that, that email.
**Dmiles**: So base bid is we're providing and installing a new VAV FPVAV and then we're removing the pneumatic thermostats.
**Dmiles**: So that's 14 of those and then we're installing 14 DDC thermostats on the existing VAV boxes.
**Dmiles**: Is that correct?
**Mlehman**: Yeah, I've got Dave Marshall on to talk about that.
**Mlehman**: So Dave, if you want to add your ideas.
**Lhoran**: Yeah.
**Lhoran**: For the 14, we would be replacing the thermostat and the controller on the VAV box.
**Lhoran**: So rather than having the pneumatic actuator on the box, we would have a new DDC actuator that would tie to that thermostat.
**Lhoran**: So there is some work above the ceiling in the base bid for those remaining boxes.
**Dmiles**: Okay.
**Dmiles**: And then I think where we messed up.
**Dmiles**: So for the alternate we would be basically replacing.
**Dmiles**: Can you describe that a little better to me so I make sure that we have it covered because I know, I know there's going to be more added to that cost for the, for the ad I gave you guys because I don't believe we included for standalone DDC controllers.
**Lhoran**: Okay.
**Lhoran**: Yeah.
**Lhoran**: So in the alternate, instead of retrofitting those 14 boxes with new controls, we would be replacing those 14 boxes and probably the easiest way to do that would be to buy those with the controllers on the boxes and the thermostats.
**Lhoran**: You can get those packaged together.
**Lhoran**: But yeah, the alternate would be to replace all 14 of those along with the controls.
**Dmiles**: So I counted 17.
**Dmiles**: Dave, is that count wrong?
**Lhoran**: 17 existing.
**Lhoran**: Right.
**Lhoran**: I think there's 19 altogether.
**Lhoran**: So I'm not sure where the 14 came from before.
**Lhoran**: For the base bid should be the same number in, in both.
**Lhoran**: So two new and 17 existing.
**Lhoran**: And then in the alternate there's 19 new.
**Dmiles**: Let me, I'll double check my counts.
**Dmiles**: I'll get with my mechanical contractor and we'll let you know what.
**Dmiles**: I should have that today for you.
**Dmiles**: What the added cost would be for after hours work.
**Dmiles**: Dan, and then, and then define this alternate cost a little bit better for you guys.
**Mlehman**: That sounds good.
**Mlehman**: I, I forget what the count was of existing.
**Mlehman**: I think it was like 13 boxes.
**Mlehman**: Maybe I, I should pull up the drawing here.
**Dmiles**: See, I got it right here.
**Mlehman**: Okay.
**Mlehman**: Yeah, I just wanted to.
**Mlehman**: And then there was I think four in the, in the expansion area.
**Mlehman**: The four in the expansion areas.
**Mlehman**: You know, certainly is, could happen anytime.
**Mlehman**: Normal working hours.
**Mlehman**: I wanted an alternate price for the 13 that are, you know, existing or whatever that town is as an after hours replacement.
**Mlehman**: Just to know, you know, is it worth the premium, you know, to do that and not, you know, bothering the engineers that are working.
**Dmarshall**: Right.
**Dmiles**: Okay, well let me, like I said, let me get with my mechanical contractor and we'll, we'll fix this ad alternate and update it for you guys.
**Dmiles**: And then I'll also give a separate line item for, for the after hours work for that.
**Mlehman**: Okay, that'd be good.
**Mlehman**: Who, who are you using for mechanical?
**Dmiles**: So, so I got pricing from three different guys.
**Mlehman**: Okay.
**Mlehman**: I'm.
**Dmiles**: Right now I'm working with, with DE and Swift Air.
**Dmiles**: So deciding between those two.
**Mlehman**: Okay.
**Dmiles**: So it's my understanding that Swift Air, they do the maintenance on your guys space.
**Dmiles**: Is that correct, Mark?
**Bclymer**: Do you know, I would say North Mechanical has been here more.
**Dmiles**: Have they?
**Dmiles**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, well, I'm not sure that we're that impressed with North Mechanical, but I think, I think that's who's been in here.
**Bclymer**: At least that's who Castle Creek used to call or not Castle Creek Zeller when they had them.
**Bclymer**: So I don't, I don't know who the new folks are.
**Lhoran**: Did the original work.
**Dmiles**: Okay, that's, that's where we got them from.
**Dmiles**: I've worked with both of them, so I'm, I'm just trying to get you guys the best price right now.
**Dmiles**: So we'll fix these alternates.
**Dmiles**: And then their base bid was just about the same.
**Dmiles**: And so it's really going to come down to who has the better pricing on the alternate.
**Dmiles**: And then we'll go from there.
**Mlehman**: Excellent.
**Mlehman**: And then have you selected EC yet?
**Dmiles**: Your electrical dean will be our electrical contractor?
**Dmiles**: Yes.
**Mlehman**: Okay.
**Dmiles**: Then we have a, a demo company, a separate demo company.
**Dmiles**: They come in and they just knock everything out for us.
**Dmiles**: And then our framing, drywall, insulation, that's a company called Superior who we have a great relationship with.
**Dmiles**: And then flooring market ready and we have our painters as well.
**Dmiles**: So.
**Mlehman**: On the electrical scope we talked about doing.
**Mlehman**: Mark, is it just the data and.
**Mlehman**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: We, we have a data price, but I think you guys included some ring and string stuff in there for wall items.
**Bclymer**: Is that correct?
**Bclymer**: A.J.
**Bclymer**: yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yep, that's what I thought.
**Dmiles**: We'll have ringing strings in the walls and then we'll put that conduit in the floor to your conference room for them.
**Dmiles**: And I think there was one other location we may have to do in the conference room over here.
**Bclymer**: There's a couple there, one behind the TV and then over in that corner next to the tv.
**Dmarshall**: Right.
**Dmiles**: So.
**Dmiles**: Yeah, we'll get all this.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: The mail room has some data jack that are in wall.
**Bclymer**: Anywhere where there's a wall jack.
**Bclymer**: Probably need a ring, some string.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Dmiles**: Yep, we'll have all that for you.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Mlehman**: And then was there a raceway between the TV in the conference room to the corner, a conduit or something?
**Bclymer**: Yes, there was like a 2 inch conduit between boxes there.
**Bclymer**: I think that was included as I recall.
**Dmiles**: Yep.
**Dmiles**: Anything.
**Dmiles**: Anything that has to do with.
**Dmiles**: With a pathway for you to pull your data.
**Dmiles**: We.
**Dmiles**: We have got it.
**Mlehman**: Good.
**Dmiles**: Now let me be clear.
**Dmiles**: Anything in the walls, it's just a string, right?
**Dmiles**: We're not actually putting conduit in the wall.
**Dmiles**: The only conduit will be in this area.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, the conduit I think was between TV and that other beta jack location and then the one for the floor box to.
**Bclymer**: I believe so.
**Dmiles**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: The rest of them would just be.
**Bclymer**: They.
**Bclymer**: They wouldn't have to be.
**Bclymer**: As long as there's a capability of, you know, we're not dealing with a wall that has insulation in it or something to try and pull data cable down.
**Mlehman**: What about fire alarm scope?
**Dmiles**: So Dean will do the fire alarm as well.
**Mlehman**: 100%.
**Mlehman**: Not just rough ins.
**Mlehman**: Okay.
**Dmarshall**: Nope.
**Dmiles**: They'll do it.
**Dmiles**: And then we'll.
**Dmiles**: We'll get with.
**Dmiles**: I know there's a.
**Dmiles**: It's a Siemens panel.
**Dmiles**: I'm not sure who the monitoring company is, but I work with property management and we get it programmed and all that.
**Mlehman**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Hey, Dan.
**Mlehman**: Mark.
**Bclymer**: Was there programming or anything required for any of the H VAC controls?
**Lhoran**: No, they'll be standalone, they'll be pre programmed.
**Lhoran**: We're not tying them together into a.
**Lhoran**: Into a central location or anything.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And that's for if we just update the controls or if they're full, if it's a full replacement.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Dmiles**: Right.
**Mlehman**: Yeah.
**Mlehman**: The.
**Mlehman**: The alternate.
**Mlehman**: If we take the alternate, we.
**Mlehman**: We're going to get the DDC controls pre mounted by price at.
**Mlehman**: You know, at.
**Mlehman**: At the manufacturer as opposed to mounting them in the field.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: I just noticed within pricing that was programming included or bms type that.
**Bclymer**: So I just want to make sure.
**Dmiles**: Yeah, we were under the assumption there is no BMS for this, for this area.
**Mlehman**: So yeah, it'll be standalone, so we're not tying back to anything.
**Mlehman**: Basically, the thermostat and the box and the controls are, you know, one standalone system.
**Dmiles**: You, Dan, you had mentioned a potential lactation room.
**Dmiles**: Have you had any more conversations with parallel on that or.
**Mlehman**: Yeah, if you want to scroll to the left or you know, corner.
**Dmiles**: Up here.
**Mlehman**: Well, yeah, let's see.
**Mlehman**: We'd have to find the existing floor plan.
**Bclymer**: There you go.
**Mlehman**: There you go.
**Mlehman**: That phone room right there.
**Dmiles**: Okay.
**Mlehman**: That's the only scope you'll have there.
**Mlehman**: We're going to just put a table in there and a refrigerator.
**Mlehman**: But that, that door, which is, you know, one of those pocket doors or whatever you want to call it, it's, it's got glass and it's, you know, it's clear we need to replace that door so the woman has privacy.
**Mlehman**: So the door replacement with, with a latch, something to lock it.
**Mlehman**: Okay.
**Mlehman**: Is the added scope for you.
**Dmiles**: Easy enough?
**Mlehman**: So add that as well to your final pricing.
**Mlehman**: Let's see what else you're going to get me.
**Mlehman**: Some alternate pricing for some for those existing boxes.
**Mlehman**: After hours you're going to update the controls and perhaps he already had it.
**Mlehman**: I don't, I don't know that we're changing much, but we, we, we want a DDC controller anyway and the, when you originally bid this, so I don't know, he de.
**Mlehman**: Might have it picked up already.
**Mlehman**: I, I just don't know.
**Dmiles**: I, I, I called them.
**Dmiles**: They, they did not.
**Dmiles**: So.
**Dmiles**: Okay, so they're, they're currently working on that, so is Swift Air.
**Mlehman**: Okay.
**Dmiles**: And I should have something here mid morning end of the day.
**Mlehman**: Okay, sounds good.
**Bclymer**: Well, you got everything, you had everything set up for COI for Castle Creek, right?
**Dmiles**: Yeah, I, I've reached out to Property Management.
**Dmiles**: Like I said, Alex is going to be our super, so I want him involved in a lot of this.
**Dmiles**: And so we'll, we'll go out there, we'll meet property management and we'll get everything squared away with them.
**Dmiles**: We did receive our permit.
**Dmiles**: Okay, we're not waiting on that anymore.
**Mlehman**: Okay.
**Dmiles**: Yeah, I logged into the portal yesterday afternoon and, and it's issued quickest.
**Dmiles**: I've gotten one issued in an indie in a long time, so.
**Dmiles**: That's awesome.
**Mlehman**: Really good.
**Dmiles**: We'll, we'll get that pulled and really it's just a matter of me putting a contract together here today, sending that to you guys so we can that going for your review and then we're ready to rock and roll here in two weeks.
**Mlehman**: Okay, good.
**Mlehman**: I agree with the comment.
**Mlehman**: I'm meeting with the property manager just to walk through the window coming down.
**Mlehman**: They might want you to pad the elevator possibly.
**Mlehman**: We see that pretty often when they're doing rentals here.
**Mlehman**: One of the elevators padded?
**Mlehman**: I can't think of much more to that unless there's after hours work.
**Mlehman**: The building does lock down, so you would have to have, you know, some card access or you'll have to work through that.
**Mlehman**: You know, in terms of any after hours work.
**Dmiles**: Yep.
**Dmiles**: Yeah.
**Dmiles**: I'm not sure when the building opens, but we'll, we'll get all that figured out because I know in our demo guys and our framers, they're going to want to start pretty early.
**Dmiles**: So definitely before 7am we'll be in there.
**Bclymer**: I think it's 6:30.
**Dmiles**: 6:30?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: We don't have to use cards anymore.
**Bclymer**: I don't believe after 6:30 we don't.
**Dmiles**: Have a ton of walls here.
**Dmiles**: But when we do build walls we like to.
**Dmiles**: Property management typically will make us shoot that track down before 7am because the people below will not like us.
**Mlehman**: Totally agree with that.
**Mlehman**: Mark or Dave, can you think of anything else we should add to this conversation?
**Lhoran**: Anything we need to talk about for.
**Mlehman**: The.
**Lhoran**: Server room unit and access to the building?
**Mlehman**: Definitely talk about that.
**Mlehman**: So it's to the right there where server.
**Mlehman**: Yeah.
**Lhoran**: We'Re on the demo plan.
**Lhoran**: But if you go to the new plan, it'll show that.
**Mlehman**: Computer.
**Lhoran**: There's a wall manage unit in the server room.
**Lhoran**: And then refrigerant piping that goes up through that plumbing chase to the, to the roof.
**Lhoran**: And then a drain that goes around to the.
**Lhoran**: Yep, there you go.
**Lhoran**: And then a drain that goes around to the mop sink there.
**Lhoran**: So I assume we'll have to get some access onto the floor above to run that through there.
**Lhoran**: And that'll have to be coordinated with the building owner.
**Dmiles**: Yeah, yeah.
**Dmiles**: And before, before we really mobilize and start demo, Alex and I will run around to all the other tenants and leave our cards and introduce ourselves, let them know that we're starting here in a week or so and make sure we show face.
**Dmiles**: That way if there is, you know, heaven forbid, a complaint or something, they call us first and don't bother you guys so we can get it taken care of.
**Mlehman**: Good.
**Dmiles**: And as far as submittals go, I'm going to be sending everything to parallel.
**Dmiles**: Definitely from an architectural standpoint, And I'll send anything mechanically to you guys as well.
**Dmiles**: That way you're.
**Dmiles**: You're in the loop because you know better.
**Mlehman**: Yeah, I appreciate that.
**Lhoran**: The only other piece of that is timing.
**Lhoran**: We want to make sure that we've got that unit up and running before we take that diffuser out that's serving that room now because that's an active server room and we want to make sure we keep cooling in there.
**Lhoran**: But that box eventually moves and serves a new.
**Lhoran**: It serves the existing storage room.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Lhoran**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Did you.
**Bclymer**: Did you locate that, Dave, with the optimal spot in there on the wall?
**Lhoran**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay, good.
**Bclymer**: Does Brad need to be moving anything for them to install that or.
**Lhoran**: Yeah, that's a good question.
**Lhoran**: I wouldn't think so, but we may want to cover up when we're working in there.
**Lhoran**: So that'd be a good thing to consult with Brad on, because we're gonna, you know, we'll be drilling some holes through the wall and having some dust from that.
**Bclymer**: Aj, I just think that.
**Bclymer**: And Brad's gonna be gone.
**Bclymer**: When's he.
**Bclymer**: A lot of June or, Or in July or something.
**Dmiles**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Just.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Making us aware maybe a week before you want to do that work.
**Bclymer**: And then we can figure out if we have to move stuff and I.
**Lhoran**: Can walk Brad through the location of that and at least give him a heads up on what's going in there.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, exactly.
**Mlehman**: That's worthwhile.
**Dmiles**: Yeah.
**Mlehman**: You know, some of these, this, these equipment items will want to.
**Mlehman**: You'll want to get those submittals pretty quick against three months is a pretty fast turnaround.
**Mlehman**: And you know, we might not even have some of this equipment, so we'll want to get this done order right away.
**Dmiles**: Yeah, definitely.
**Mlehman**: I'll.
**Dmiles**: I'll go ahead and get Lois out today.
**Dmiles**: So.
**Dmiles**: Submittals rolling.
**Dmiles**: The biggest thing is I need to get that you get with Swift Air and with deemed to make sure I have that best alternate price, get that to you guys.
**Dmiles**: And then from there I can make a decision on who I'm using.
**Dmiles**: And you know, they obviously want the work.
**Dmiles**: So I'll.
**Dmiles**: I'll get a submittal right away here this week for you guys.
**Dmiles**: And then in regards to the schedule, guys, I.
**Dmiles**: I send a.
**Dmiles**: We update the schedule weekly and then I send a two week look ahead out pretty regularly.
**Dmiles**: So I'll make sure you guys get that every week and you can have an idea of what's going on in the next two weeks.
**Dmiles**: And then I send a weekly report as well.
**Dmiles**: So between those three things, hopefully there's plenty of communication on our end to let you guys know what's going on in the future.
**Mlehman**: Excellent.
**Mlehman**: Okay, well, we'll look look for that contract today or tomorrow.
**Mlehman**: And.
**Mlehman**: And the final pricing.
**Mlehman**: We owe you decision on the.
**Mlehman**: The alternates.
**Mlehman**: So we'll go work through those this week once we see that final pricing and, you know, we'll ready to be ready to go on the 17th.
**Dmiles**: Sounds like a plan.
**Mlehman**: Well, thanks.
**Dmiles**: C.J.
**Dmiles**: jesse, you got anything?
**Mlehman**: Shoot.
**Dmarshall**: Nothing.
**Dmarshall**: Looking forward to working with you guys and getting this thing knocked out for you.
**Mlehman**: Appreciate it.
**Dmiles**: Alrighty, guys.
**Dmiles**: Have a good one.
**Bclymer**: Thank you.
**Dmarshall**: Thanks.
**Mlehman**: Thank you.
**Dmarshall**: Bye.
