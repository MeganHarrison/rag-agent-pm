## Transcript
**Bschwartz**: It's.
**Bcritzman**: It's Al's AI that takes meeting minutes.
**Bcritzman**: It's really cool trying to get our company to inherit something like that.
**Bryan.wagar**: I think you were showing me the other day.
**Bcritzman**: Yeah, dude, it's amazing.
**Bcritzman**: Hey, Brian.
**Ken.mathewson**: Hey, man.
**Ken.mathewson**: How's it going?
**Bcritzman**: It's going.
**Bcritzman**: It's going.
**Bcritzman**: How's little man feeling?
**Ken.mathewson**: Better now.
**Ken.mathewson**: I've got what he's got, so.
**Bcritzman**: Oh, no.
**Ken.mathewson**: Yep, that's how it works.
**Bcritzman**: That's the one thing I'm not excited about.
**Ken.mathewson**: Yeah, they're little petri dishes.
**Ken.mathewson**: Enjoy.
**Bryan.wagar**: Ahmed, you want to give Brian the good news?
**Bcritzman**: So, Brian, we've been coordinating with Exotech past few days, and we.
**Bcritzman**: We received some updated backgrounds, and the only effects were the exit signs because they changed where the doors were.
**Bcritzman**: So we updated the backgrounds accordingly.
**Bcritzman**: And then they came back this morning again or in the afternoon and said that it's updated again.
**Bcritzman**: So we revised them another time, but again, it's only updates to exit signs.
**Bcritzman**: So I don't know if that's impacts your drawings at all or not, but we're planning on issuing backgrounds during this call to everyone with.
**Bcritzman**: With the updated sheets and whatnot.
**Ken.mathewson**: That's.
**Ken.mathewson**: That's good news, Ben.
**Bcritzman**: No, no, that's the bad news.
**Ken.mathewson**: Okay, what's the good news?
**Bryan.wagar**: No, I don't know if there's any good news is.
**Bcritzman**: The good news is I just switched to Geico, so I saved 15% on my quarantines.
**Ken.mathewson**: The good news is I stayed at Holiday Inn Express last night, so I have an expert.
**David.leddy**: Oh, no.
**David.leddy**: Oh, no.
**Bryan.wagar**: That does not sound.
**Bryan.wagar**: It's the only change.
**Bryan.wagar**: I don't know how you guys are setting up your drawings.
**Bryan.wagar**: Are you guys using, like, Xrefs with the background?
**Bcritzman**: I think they're using Revit.
**Bryan.wagar**: Oh, you're on Revit.
**Ken.mathewson**: Yeah, we're using Revit.
**Ken.mathewson**: So we'll just take the clean backgrounds and relink them into our Revit models.
**Bryan.wagar**: Does it help you if we just give you, like, our background file?
**Bryan.wagar**: You don't really need the sheets files at that point then, Right?
**Bryan.wagar**: Because you kind of just need the location of where the doors are.
**Ken.mathewson**: Yeah, we.
**Ken.mathewson**: We don't necessarily need your sheets.
**Ken.mathewson**: We just need the.
**Ken.mathewson**: The XREF that you guys are using for the building and that.
**Bryan.wagar**: Our XPR plan?
**Race.kangas**: Yep.
**Race.kangas**: Okay.
**Bcritzman**: The PR plan that shows the site and everything then?
**Bryan.wagar**: Well, it'll show the building and then the location of the sky pod within the building.
**David.leddy**: Correct.
**Bcritzman**: All right.
**Race.kangas**: Yeah.
**Bryan.wagar**: So, but they don't need like our a 100 and a 300.
**Bryan.wagar**: This way it'll be like, easier for them.
**Bryan.wagar**: There'll be a later file.
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay, I can.
**Bryan.wagar**: I can do that.
**Bryan.wagar**: Once Exotech confirms we're in the correct location, I will get that file over to you.
**Ken.mathewson**: Sounds good.
**Ken.mathewson**: I thought the good news was that we were.
**Ken.mathewson**: We were pushing the permit date again.
**Bcritzman**: No staying.
**Ken.mathewson**: Sorry, no.
**Bcritzman**: Exotech's going to be able to turn over the backgrounds the same day as Henderson.
**Bcritzman**: So it worked out all right.
**Ken.mathewson**: I will continue putting in my sign and seal reminder for my Erson.
**Ken.mathewson**: I did.
**Ken.mathewson**: I did get plotting kind of figured out.
**Ken.mathewson**: Ahmed.
**Ken.mathewson**: So we.
**Ken.mathewson**: I don't know if this is the same company that you guys use, but there's an arc just across around the corner from our New York office.
**Ken.mathewson**: So we're gonna sign and seal digitally on our end, and then I'll ship them to this arc to have them plot.
**Ken.mathewson**: And then someone from our office will pick up and deliver them to your office.
**Bcritzman**: That company also delivers like, walks them over to our office all the time, just so you're aware.
**Ken.mathewson**: Okay, well, so when you go on.
**Bcritzman**: The link that the website, when they ask you like what.
**Bcritzman**: What's like to give them a.
**Bcritzman**: Like a blurb, this many sets, 36 by 48.
**Bcritzman**: You tell them the sheet size and you also give them the address.
**Bcritzman**: They'll charge you for the ship, for the shipment, and it gives you the option for like over and you have to say overnight or like same day delivery when they.
**Bcritzman**: When you send it.
**Ken.mathewson**: Okay, yeah, I'll look.
**Ken.mathewson**: I'll look into that.
**Ken.mathewson**: Maybe we can just have them delivered straight to you guys.
**Ken.mathewson**: I have never plotted like this or it's been a long time since I've plotted hard copies like this.
**Bcritzman**: Yeah, we were doing it through Covid using that.
**Bcritzman**: That interface when everyone was working from home.
**Bcritzman**: So it was.
**Bcritzman**: It was really clutch.
**David.leddy**: Hey, Joe.
**Bschwartz**: Yep.
**Bcritzman**: We're going to be sending the backgrounds imposed and whatnot onto our like full site background.
**Bcritzman**: And if you could just confirm it that everything looks good, we'll.
**Bcritzman**: We'll let Aliato kind of start using them as well as Henderson and the rest of the team.
**Bschwartz**: No, that's fine.
**Bschwartz**: I'll get my engineer to look at it as soon as I see him.
**Bcritzman**: And we're going to send you a PDF so then you don't have to open the DWG itself.
**Bcritzman**: Like if you need to just see it from there, everything is all together.
**Bschwartz**: Yeah, they'll be able to take care of it.
**Bcritzman**: Thanks.
**Bschwartz**: Sir, I also.
**Bschwartz**: I also wanted to clarify.
**Bschwartz**: I did talk with my engineering team that applied for these pe, the PE stamps.
**Bschwartz**: And you know, I'm told as far as permitting goes there, the PE is for low balance, you know, loads and seismic and things of that nature.
**Bschwartz**: Adding in a gate on a fence is not going to hold up getting any kind of permits.
**Bschwartz**: They have to go through a great deal of work to.
**Bschwartz**: To redo these if there's a caveat that needs to be made and amend that says, hey, doors were added here and here.
**Bschwartz**: But adding.
**Bschwartz**: Adding doors on the gate is not going to change any of the calculations that the PE actually checks for and stamps.
**Bcritzman**: So is there an issue with the drawings that are going out?
**Bschwartz**: No, I'm saying I told you that we added the two doors and then I sent you the stamp drawings, and then it sounded like you wanted me to get them restamped, and I.
**Bschwartz**: I don't think that's necessary.
**Bcritzman**: Okay, so we'll submit whatever you're going to send out, and we'll.
**Bcritzman**: We'll see if there's any objections.
**Bcritzman**: But if there are, we understand why.
**Bcritzman**: If there aren't, we're good to go.
**Bschwartz**: Benjamin has them.
**Bschwartz**: It's in the email.
**Bschwartz**: There was two links.
**Bschwartz**: I finally got this.
**Bschwartz**: I don't know why I was having such issues with Dropbox today, but one was the DWG file that y'all needed, and then the other file had all three stamped drawings there.
**Bcritzman**: So those.
**Bcritzman**: So those three drawings we can zip up and send out to Brandon.
**David.leddy**: Correct.
**Bcritzman**: Got it.
**Bcritzman**: Okay, perfect.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, the links work perfect.
**Bschwartz**: Thank you for verifying quickly, Benjamin.
**Bryan.wagar**: No problem.
**Bschwartz**: I apologize for the issues that's happened today.
**Bryan.wagar**: It's all good.
**Bryan.wagar**: I'm going to be sending that email shortly with the link for the cads.
**Bcritzman**: So we're going to send.
**Bcritzman**: And Brandon's plotting for exotech, right, John?
**Bcritzman**: He's plotting your drawings and everything for the submission.
**Bschwartz**: Yes, that's what he was saying yesterday.
**Bcritzman**: Okay.
**Bcritzman**: All right, perfect.
**Bcritzman**: Well, Yusuke, do you have anything you want to go over?
**Bcritzman**: I know we kind of covered a lot of topics yesterday, especially with schedule and whatnot, but is there anything at this time that you want to go over?
**David.leddy**: How about the electrical drop?
**David.leddy**: I understand that we can like revised after we fix the drop location.
**Bcritzman**: That's later when they start construction.
**David.leddy**: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
**David.leddy**: And also we haven't fixed the actual location yet because we.
**David.leddy**: We haven't finished study phase.
**David.leddy**: What's they called?
**David.leddy**: Correct.
**Bschwartz**: Yep.
**Bschwartz**: So that is on.
**Bschwartz**: That is on us.
**David.leddy**: Yeah.
**David.leddy**: So we have to fix after the study phase finalized.
**David.leddy**: So I understand that, but like Ahmed didn't we talk about like, what which, like drop location is showing what kind of drop is for.
**David.leddy**: Let's do that.
**David.leddy**: Skype.
**Bcritzman**: I gotcha.
**David.leddy**: Yeah.
**Bcritzman**: So, Luther and Brian, if you guys mind sharing your drawing on the screen.
**Bcritzman**: The electrical drawing specifically.
**Bcritzman**: What you suit case trying to determine is where are all these electrical drops happening as they relate to the tagging on the sheets?
**Bcritzman**: Because we do see, like there's a T1, T2, T3 tag, and then when you go to the schedule, it says tel.
**Bcritzman**: So we're not sure if they kind of are the same.
**Bcritzman**: And maybe there's just like an extra letter that was missing or added.
**Bcritzman**: But if you can just share on screen how many drops are occurring and where they're occurring.
**Race.kangas**: Yep.
**Ken.mathewson**: Let me pull up drawings.
**Bcritzman**: I figured that it was the TE is for the transformers, and that's where all the drops really occur.
**Bcritzman**: I counted about 10.
**Ken.mathewson**: You're talking about these?
**Bcritzman**: Yes.
**Bcritzman**: But if you go to the plan, I think they're tagged in the plan itself.
**Bcritzman**: You know why Bluebeam does that where it doesn't let you load that tab that you just had open?
**Ken.mathewson**: I don't know.
**Ken.mathewson**: It frustrates the heck out of me sometimes.
**Ken.mathewson**: All right, so we should have HE one, which is the main new panel being added at the back of the system.
**Ken.mathewson**: Then TE1 LE1 right here at the the corner of these restrooms office block.
**Ken.mathewson**: I'm gonna jump down around a little bit just to go in order.
**Bcritzman**: Yeah.
**David.leddy**: Overall plan is better to understand.
**Race.kangas**: There we go.
**Race.kangas**: Okay.
**Race.kangas**: Yeah.
**Ken.mathewson**: Te 1, Le 1, Te 2, Te 3, Te 4, Te 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
**Ken.mathewson**: 9 and 10.
**Bcritzman**: Was right.
**Bcritzman**: Wow, I read them right.
**Bcritzman**: Sweet.
**Bcritzman**: So that's 10 drops.
**Bcritzman**: Yusuke, even though I know the presentation that was sent in, the email from Exotech just talks about the immediate transformer drops along our Sky Pods, but there are some along the perimeter that are occurring as well.
**Bcritzman**: And by the.
**Bcritzman**: By the desk stations, the workstations.
**Ken.mathewson**: So.
**Ken.mathewson**: And the reason, Suzuki, the reason for that.
**Ken.mathewson**: The reason for that is your HE1 panel is at 480 volts.
**Ken.mathewson**: 482.77.
**Ken.mathewson**: The Skypod Skypath system is at 400 volts.
**Ken.mathewson**: And there were eight drops for that.
**Ken.mathewson**: So that's TE2 through T.
**Ken.mathewson**: Well, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 6, 7, 8 and 10 are all your Skypod Skypath drops.
**David.leddy**: And then that's for exotic system.
**David.leddy**: Okay?
**Race.kangas**: Yep, yep.
**Ken.mathewson**: And then there's also some 120 volt 2.8volt loads associated with the Skypads Skypath system and all Your workstations will all need 120 volt power.
**Ken.mathewson**: And that's what LE1, TE1, LE1 and TE9.
**Ken.mathewson**: LE9 will serve is anything that's at 208, 120.
**Bcritzman**: And what does.
**Bcritzman**: Where is the compressor power being dragged from?
**Ken.mathewson**: That should be from HE one, I believe.
**Ken.mathewson**: Yeah.
**Race.kangas**: Yep.
**Ken.mathewson**: So compressors will be pulled directly from HE one.
**Bcritzman**: And where is that one located in plan?
**Ken.mathewson**: Up here at the north.
**Ken.mathewson**: It's.
**Ken.mathewson**: It's a long run, but.
**David.leddy**: It should be dropping the south near the.
**Ken.mathewson**: The panel is up here.
**Ken.mathewson**: And they'll feed across to the.
**Ken.mathewson**: The air compressor drops around there.
**Race.kangas**: Yep.
**Ken.mathewson**: And I think that should be show.
**Race.kangas**: Yep.
**Ken.mathewson**: Here.
**Ken.mathewson**: So there's your compressors and we've got some disconnect switches for the power to those and then some.
**Ken.mathewson**: A general convenience receptacle too.
**David.leddy**: Like kind of switch gears there too.
**Ken.mathewson**: These two.
**Ken.mathewson**: Yeah, they're disconnect switches, so.
**David.leddy**: Disconnect switches?
**Ken.mathewson**: Yeah, it's kind of switch gear.
**Ken.mathewson**: Not.
**Ken.mathewson**: Not switch gear.
**Ken.mathewson**: It's.
**Ken.mathewson**: It's a small.
**Ken.mathewson**: It'll probably be.
**Ken.mathewson**: It'll probably be like 6 to 8 inches wide by probably 10 or 12 inches tall.
**Ken.mathewson**: And it has a little handle on the side that allows you to disconnect power from that panel at the back when you need to service that equipment.
**Bschwartz**: All right.
**Bschwartz**: All right.
**Bschwartz**: Right.
**Ken.mathewson**: And that's just a code requirement to have that disconnect switch in line.
**Ken.mathewson**: So.
**David.leddy**: Okay.
**David.leddy**: Okay.
**David.leddy**: Is it.
**David.leddy**: No problem.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Sorry about.
**Joseph.burdzy**: For Skypod and Skype pass.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Could you say that again?
**Joseph.burdzy**: Which one is for Skype and Skype path?
**Ken.mathewson**: The e2, e3, e4, e5, e2, e4 is the.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Skyport.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Full Skyport for Rocket station, correct?
**Race.kangas**: Yeah.
**Ken.mathewson**: E2 and E5 are the sky path on the north side.
**Ken.mathewson**: And then I believe E8 and E10 are the sky path on the south side.
**Ken.mathewson**: And then E3, E4, E6 and E7 are the sky Pod drops.
**David.leddy**: Okay.
**David.leddy**: And Brian, where is the power for the workstation comes from?
**Ken.mathewson**: Those will be fed out of either Le1te1 or Le9te9, depending on what side of the system they're on.
**David.leddy**: So we have to run that.
**David.leddy**: Run some like extension like cable to the workstation, something like that.
**Ken.mathewson**: The contractor should install a branch circuit from that panel and drop it at the workstations.
**David.leddy**: So.
**Ken.mathewson**: Yeah, you.
**Ken.mathewson**: You guys won't have to run anything.
**David.leddy**: Okay.
**David.leddy**: Okay.
**David.leddy**: So contractor will be run.
**David.leddy**: Run on the seal to.
**David.leddy**: From TE9 to left and right and drop down to the exact way we want.
**Race.kangas**: Yep.
**David.leddy**: And also in the top side TE1 2.
**Race.kangas**: Yep.
**Ken.mathewson**: Yeah.
**Ken.mathewson**: They'll run out to probably this column line and then over to your two work your two workstation locations with power.
**David.leddy**: Okay.
**David.leddy**: And how do the contractor know where.
**Ken.mathewson**: To drop for workstation that would be on these plans?
**Ken.mathewson**: So we've got those.
**Ken.mathewson**: We've got those devices shown with a home run and that dictates to them which panel they should pull.
**Ken.mathewson**: That panel and circuit.
**Ken.mathewson**: They should pull those.
**Ken.mathewson**: Those feeders or those branch circuits from.
**David.leddy**: Okay.
**David.leddy**: LE9 comes to this location.
**David.leddy**: LE9.
**David.leddy**: So this houser part that.
**Ken.mathewson**: That's the south one.
**Ken.mathewson**: Yep.
**Ken.mathewson**: So we're okay.
**Ken.mathewson**: South 1 KJ 29.
**Ken.mathewson**: So that's.
**Ken.mathewson**: Yeah, that's this workstation here.
**David.leddy**: Okay.
**David.leddy**: Okay.
**David.leddy**: Drop will become from Le9.
**David.leddy**: So in the other section drawing.
**Race.kangas**: Yep.
**David.leddy**: Okay.
**David.leddy**: And how like how much of the outlets we have for each.
**David.leddy**: Each drop is shown in like this like two times two for.
**Ken.mathewson**: For power.
**Ken.mathewson**: So each one of these is a quad.
**Ken.mathewson**: So it's got four different plugins in it.
**Ken.mathewson**: So you've got one quad for two desks here and one quad for two desks here.
**Ken.mathewson**: I think that's what we had agreed upon.
**Ken.mathewson**: Right Ahmed?
**Bschwartz**: Yeah.
**Bcritzman**: John, Min and Yusuke were the ones.
**David.leddy**: That kind of dictated the reduction total total eight.
**Ken.mathewson**: A total of.
**Ken.mathewson**: Yeah.
**Ken.mathewson**: You can plug in a total of eight devices at those stations.
**David.leddy**: Okay.
**David.leddy**: Can you.
**David.leddy**: Can you go to over overall?
**Race.kangas**: Yep.
**David.leddy**: So Joseph, do you remember where the QPS totes comes from?
**David.leddy**: So we have to use the printer at the point where QPS totes goes.
**David.leddy**: And.
**Bschwartz**: QPS are in the bottom right, bottom left of the sky pods, bottom.
**David.leddy**: Left and bottom right.
**David.leddy**: So it means to the right of that.
**Bschwartz**: That's.
**Bschwartz**: That's a maintenance.
**Bschwartz**: So on the right side.
**Bschwartz**: Yeah.
**Bschwartz**: That little square right there is basically going to be your.
**Bschwartz**: That area exchangers are.
**David.leddy**: So we have to bring some power there for the printer around there.
**David.leddy**: In that case, we have to extend our code from working station.
**Race.kangas**: We.
**Ken.mathewson**: We.
**Ken.mathewson**: We can either extend power over to these locations from the workstations or we can pull a brand new branch circuit from this set of panels or this panel and transformer to these locations.
**David.leddy**: And if I see the section drawing, it is not dropped yet.
**David.leddy**: So we have to add.
**David.leddy**: Add on the section drawing if we want it to drop there.
**Race.kangas**: Yeah.
**David.leddy**: Right.
**Race.kangas**: Yep.
**Ken.mathewson**: That's.
**Ken.mathewson**: That's some of that third party equipment coordination that's going to need to be to happen after the out to permit sets issued.
**Ken.mathewson**: But if, if there's.
**Ken.mathewson**: I mean we've got power designated in this panel.
**Ken.mathewson**: We've got enough Capacity and room in the panel for additional loads.
**Ken.mathewson**: So if, if there's something not shown on the drawings currently and we need to issue a revision to include that, we've got the capacity to be able to add those.
**David.leddy**: So sorry again.
**David.leddy**: What is about the third party kind of thing?
**David.leddy**: We, we have to coordinate with third party like vendors or something to.
**Ken.mathewson**: No, I'm using the word third party because that's just what Exotech had used.
**Ken.mathewson**: Third party equipment.
**David.leddy**: Third party equipment.
**David.leddy**: Wow.
**David.leddy**: Okay, okay.
**David.leddy**: Third party equipment.
**Ken.mathewson**: Okay, so we've got the Sky Pod and the Sky Pass already already shown on there.
**Ken.mathewson**: Those are covered.
**Ken.mathewson**: We've got, we've got loads in, in the panels.
**Ken.mathewson**: We've got all this, the rest of this equipment accounted for in our loads.
**Ken.mathewson**: We just don't know the exact locations of them, but we've got it accounted for our load.
**Ken.mathewson**: So once we know exactly where that equipment's going to fall, we can put that on our plans so it's more clear to the contractor where that load is going to be going to fall within the system.
**Ken.mathewson**: And then same thing with those printers.
**Ken.mathewson**: If we need to add printers, add power for printers in a couple of locations, we should still have additional capacity on those panels to be able to handle a few extra loads.
**David.leddy**: Joe, this labeler, carton, erector carton, sealers, RFID tunnel, those kind of third party equipments.
**David.leddy**: Power served from the main power cabinet.
**David.leddy**: Isn't it like do contractor have to drop it to.
**David.leddy**: The exact locations are going to come.
**Bschwartz**: Off of the sky.
**Bschwartz**: Five ones.
**Bschwartz**: That's what Sky Path actually.
**Bschwartz**: What?
**Bschwartz**: That's actually.
**Bschwartz**: Yeah, the Sky Path.
**Bschwartz**: That's what we're actually finishing up right now.
**Bschwartz**: So yes, in the initial proposal, just like you have and everything's laid out is we need eight drops, four for the Sky Pod, for, for the Sky Path.
**Bschwartz**: But we are, you know, the Sky Pods are going to stay the same.
**Bschwartz**: They just might move.
**Bschwartz**: One of them I think is going to move from the north to the south and we'll have three Sky Path drops on the bottom and one Sky Path on the top.
**Bschwartz**: But the number of the drops that you're paying for doesn't change.
**Bschwartz**: It's just the location of where it's going to go.
**David.leddy**: Okay, so if we wanted to add another job, that is for our operation equipment, that's the part we wanted to.
**David.leddy**: Yeah, add it.
**David.leddy**: So.
**David.leddy**: So Brian, can you go back to overall plan again?
**David.leddy**: So Ahmed, do you remember that we talked about like we need to add some but we can do anything, right?
**David.leddy**: We can just Run through the working station.
**David.leddy**: Or we can just drop it directly to the qps.
**David.leddy**: QPS totes.
**David.leddy**: Location of the printer, printer of the GPS toads location.
**Bcritzman**: I.
**Bcritzman**: I am not sure.
**Bcritzman**: But you can.
**Bcritzman**: But at the same time you're going to have wires.
**Bcritzman**: You're saying you want to plug at the workstations and extend it all the way to that green hatched area?
**David.leddy**: Yeah, something like that.
**David.leddy**: Yeah.
**David.leddy**: Or directly drop to the green hatch near the green hatched area.
**Bcritzman**: Well, 11 is free.
**Bcritzman**: 11 costs money.
**Bcritzman**: So.
**Bcritzman**: So like if we have to drop, I'm pretty sure that's going to be caught a little.
**Bcritzman**: That's gonna.
**Bcritzman**: That's gonna add a little bit of cost.
**Bcritzman**: But maybe, maybe not a lot.
**Bcritzman**: You know, like we need to just speak with Brandon and see if they're able to pull from that cabinet that we have spare switches and just you know, drop them where we need to.
**Bcritzman**: So then it's a clean solution.
**Bcritzman**: I used your terminology, Joe.
**Ken.mathewson**: Yep.
**Ken.mathewson**: My recommendation would not to.
**Ken.mathewson**: Would be to not run an extension cord.
**Bcritzman**: No.
**Ken.mathewson**: From the workstation to the.
**Ken.mathewson**: The printers.
**Ken.mathewson**: I'm actually pretty sure that's a code violation, so.
**Ken.mathewson**: Really?
**Ken.mathewson**: Yeah.
**Ken.mathewson**: Extension cords are not a.
**Ken.mathewson**: Not considered a permanent solution per the code.
**Bschwartz**: Yeah.
**Ken.mathewson**: So you.
**Ken.mathewson**: You can't.
**Ken.mathewson**: You're not supposed to have permanent fixtures.
**Ken.mathewson**: Permanent equipment fed by an extension cord.
**Bcritzman**: I learned that the hard way two years ago.
**Bcritzman**: Not gonna lie.
**Bcritzman**: I did it in a residential house and wasn't a smart move.
**David.leddy**: Okay.
**David.leddy**: Ahmed, do you have any like latest like I forgot which document shows the latest cable drugs drops for like networking.
**Bcritzman**: We don't have that.
**Bcritzman**: That's by Damien Network is all by Damien.
**David.leddy**: Yeah, that's by Damien.
**David.leddy**: Yes.
**David.leddy**: Yeah, but the power supply should be supplied by contractor side.
**David.leddy**: They will.
**David.leddy**: They'll pull down the network cable.
**David.leddy**: But the power supply cable is from.
**David.leddy**: Is for.
**David.leddy**: Is on us.
**Ken.mathewson**: Are you talking for the workstations?
**David.leddy**: Yeah, workstations.
**David.leddy**: And also we need some like.
**Bcritzman**: Let me.
**David.leddy**: Let me find.
**Bcritzman**: Is this for your IDF cabinets as well?
**David.leddy**: IDF cabinets as well?
**Bschwartz**: Yes.
**Bcritzman**: No, I don't think we.
**Bcritzman**: I don't think we've discussed adding power for that.
**David.leddy**: Joseph, do you remember that discussed about like running the cable under the conveyor is possible or impossible for power supply to the printer near the qps?
**Bschwartz**: Yeah, with power supply you have.
**Bschwartz**: You have to get an outlet there.
**Bschwartz**: You're not going to want to run and pull that kind of cable on.
**Bschwartz**: On the conveyors and stuff.
**Bschwartz**: It's.
**Bcritzman**: It's.
**Bschwartz**: It's not going to look pretty and you really Want to professionally and get a.
**Bschwartz**: Get a 120 outlet out there?
**David.leddy**: Yeah, yeah.
**David.leddy**: Okay, let me.
**David.leddy**: I got.
**David.leddy**: I got the information.
**David.leddy**: Let me share my screen.
**David.leddy**: I always felt this is the one.
**David.leddy**: So the yellow triangle is for PC station printer 8 etc for the power drop.
**David.leddy**: And also we need some.
**David.leddy**: This yellow triangle too.
**David.leddy**: Remember this one?
**Bschwartz**: No, I.
**Bschwartz**: I remember this drawing.
**Bschwartz**: I just.
**Bschwartz**: I'm not.
**Bschwartz**: I'm not sure where.
**Bschwartz**: Where you want to.
**Bschwartz**: Where we're wanting to get this.
**David.leddy**: This yellow one.
**David.leddy**: This.
**David.leddy**: This part.
**Bschwartz**: We wanted to confirm C Station printers number of locations.
**David.leddy**: Yeah, we.
**David.leddy**: We confirmed that there is a drop for this working station.
**David.leddy**: But we also requested this part.
**David.leddy**: The yellow part here.
**Bcritzman**: When was this requested?
**David.leddy**: Like.
**David.leddy**: Like first.
**David.leddy**: First in the kickoff meeting too?
**Bcritzman**: No, no, it's okay.
**Bcritzman**: So after the kickoff meeting, drawings were issued.
**Bcritzman**: So we sent you a client review set on the 15th, and then we sent you another set on February 1st.
**Bcritzman**: This was never brought up.
**Bcritzman**: And then if anything, when you and I and John Min were talking about data supply, we reduced the data supply together and the power requirements.
**Bcritzman**: So this is new.
**Bcritzman**: This is new information at this time.
**David.leddy**: No, no, it's not.
**David.leddy**: Okay, let me confirm.
**David.leddy**: I think we discussed several times for this one, especially inbound.
**David.leddy**: Outbound for.
**David.leddy**: You know, we discussed that we have to come from this one director here by extension code or like drop in directly.
**David.leddy**: We discussed this one.
**David.leddy**: Like we.
**David.leddy**: We talk with Joseph and Ahmed for like run the cable under the conveyor is like possible or not.
**David.leddy**: Blah, blah, blah.
**Bcritzman**: That just.
**Bcritzman**: That just happened today.
**Bcritzman**: We just did this today.
**Bcritzman**: Just saying.
**David.leddy**: No, no, no.
**Bcritzman**: I would have put this in the background.
**Bcritzman**: You suke from day one.
**Bcritzman**: But this was.
**Bcritzman**: This was not conveyed to us.
**Bcritzman**: And then on the client review set, you and I and John Min got on the call together and we started talking about the data.
**Bcritzman**: And even Damien was on the call.
**Bcritzman**: There was multiple people on the call.
**David.leddy**: Damien is for this one.
**Bcritzman**: So Damien is supplying these drops.
**David.leddy**: This is for.
**David.leddy**: This is.
**David.leddy**: Yeah, Damien will be dropping network cable, but not the power supply cable.
**Ken.mathewson**: Yasuke, this says network drop locations.
**David.leddy**: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
**David.leddy**: Let me confirm as Damien again, but.
**Ken.mathewson**: Which I think is in alignment with.
**Ken.mathewson**: Yeah, this is in alignment with what we're showing.
**Ken.mathewson**: As far as network drops at the workstations.
**Ken.mathewson**: We've got two at each workstation which aligns with that yellow triangle.
**David.leddy**: This is.
**David.leddy**: This is network drop.
**David.leddy**: But how about the power drop?
**David.leddy**: I.
**David.leddy**: I forgot.
**David.leddy**: What.
**David.leddy**: What should we do for this one power supply?
**David.leddy**: So Ahmed, we haven't discussed the power supply for this like printer around.
**David.leddy**: Around the sky.
**David.leddy**: Pot Skypath conveyor around here?
**Bcritzman**: No, because that's what we asked previously when I told you that the Daifuku in your current warehouse has outlets mounted to the fence area.
**Bcritzman**: And I remember bringing this up and saying, do we need convenience outlets for the bots?
**Bcritzman**: And then we said, oh no, it's not like the daifuku.
**Bcritzman**: We don't need any outlets along the perimeter.
**Bcritzman**: That's what, that's what I recall.
**David.leddy**: Is it?
**Bcritzman**: So if we need to add them, we can add them, but this is a change.
**Bcritzman**: That's all it is.
**Bcritzman**: But I don't urge that we update the drawings right now.
**Bcritzman**: So then we continue targeting the 417 date.
**Bcritzman**: And then once we are done with permit, we issue a bulletin for Aliato and the team to be aware that this is where the these occur.
**David.leddy**: So right now, Brian, right now we don't have any powers for the printers in this yellow triangle location around the conveyor, correct?
**Ken.mathewson**: Yeah.
**Ken.mathewson**: We weren't aware that you guys needed power there.
**Ken.mathewson**: I think.
**Ken.mathewson**: I think we'd heard about printers once previously, but we never got final locations or confirmation of how much power was needed, so.
**Bcritzman**: But John Min said that the printers would be by the workstations and that's why there's two ports at each station.
**David.leddy**: You mean around the table desks?
**Bcritzman**: Correct?
**Bcritzman**: Yeah.
**Bcritzman**: So if you move the printers there, you still have those extra ones at each side because you have two and two.
**Ken.mathewson**: But.
**David.leddy**: Okay, okay, but Ahmed, haven't you discussed like previously with Damien that about like, how many, like the height of the debt like desk located here and how many outlets you need with things like you.
**David.leddy**: You send some kind of like message or discussion to Damien before.
**Bcritzman**: No, no, we were just talking about the workstations you took because you were helping me figure out what kind of outlet you need.
**Bcritzman**: Whether you were going to go with a LeGrand or just a basic quad, which is what John Min stated.
**David.leddy**: Or was it about this one?
**David.leddy**: This station?
**Bcritzman**: No, it was just those.
**Bcritzman**: Yes, we only had a call about those.
**David.leddy**: Okay.
**David.leddy**: Yeah, all right, all right.
**David.leddy**: But I.
**David.leddy**: I started remembering that some kind of question is pending on Damien.
**David.leddy**: Is there any?
**Bcritzman**: No.
**Bcritzman**: Last.
**Bcritzman**: Last thing I know from you all is that the IDF closets that are currently in conflict with, let's say the GU area and the current area that we're working.
**Bcritzman**: Working in are going to be relocated in the beginning of April.
**Bcritzman**: So they should be gone at this time.
**Bcritzman**: And we don't have any conflicts where you install them is whatever you do.
**Bcritzman**: You guys said you're going to do it maybe in May, maybe also at the end of April.
**Bcritzman**: So I'm not sure if you, that that's something that you said you guys were going to deliver solely on fast retail and like the IT folks.
**David.leddy**: Yeah, it's about like IDF part is it's kind of different topic we discussed last time.
**Bschwartz**: So.
**David.leddy**: So we are like we don't have any power for this one right now.
**David.leddy**: Okay, okay, Let me confirm Ms.
**David.leddy**: Damien.
**Bcritzman**: And keep in mind though like the, the span to the, the EL9 panel, it's not far.
**David.leddy**: Which one?
**Bcritzman**: The panel where you can get, get power for these items and create the drop downs.
**Bcritzman**: Yeah, for all of them.
**Bcritzman**: Yeah, for all this whole entire row.
**Bcritzman**: The panel is planned south like two column bays below.
**David.leddy**: Oh yeah.
**David.leddy**: And I, I also remember that if we could use this power cabinet for the location of pulling out the power for here.
**David.leddy**: Joseph, do you remember that?
**David.leddy**: Do, do you remember that we asked that for the power supply for this location.
**David.leddy**: Can we use your cabinets power a little bit for this printer?
**Bschwartz**: We're gonna have to consult with the electrician.
**Bschwartz**: We need to have that conversation.
**Bschwartz**: We need to set up a different call.
**Bschwartz**: I, I, I don't know of if it's a good idea for the customer to be you pulling out of our, you know, electrical cabinets.
**Bschwartz**: That is dedicated for the Sky Pod system.
**Bschwartz**: I don't, I'm, I'm not familiar with that.
**Bschwartz**: If we need to go deeper into that, we need to set something different up so I can get some experts on here to say what we can and can't use.
**Bschwartz**: From what I know, everything that we request is basically dedicated for the system.
**Bschwartz**: Therefore it's, you know, our responsibility to maintain it.
**David.leddy**: Okay, okay.
**David.leddy**: Yeah, but I remember that we discussed this one before.
**David.leddy**: Ahmed, do you remember the conclusion for this one?
**Bcritzman**: I do not recall this conversation.
**Bcritzman**: You suka, if anything, this might have been a breakout call with just Exotech.
**David.leddy**: No, no, no.
**David.leddy**: Within this meeting, as I remember.
**David.leddy**: Brian, do you.
**Bcritzman**: Oh, in the beginning of the call you mean?
**Bcritzman**: Yeah, you were asking if we can pull from there, but I don't think anyone confirmed yet.
**Bcritzman**: And Exotech needs to be able to confirm that because it's there.
**Bcritzman**: It's their panel at the end of the day.
**Bcritzman**: So we need to make sure that it doesn't harm any of their metering or if they're tracking certain power consumptions.
**Bcritzman**: It might play a little.
**Bcritzman**: That's why he's saying he needs to speak to others.
**Bcritzman**: But prior to giving you a solid answer.
**David.leddy**: Yeah, January or somewhere.
**Bschwartz**: Yeah, but we request Power based on the equipment that we're installing.
**Bschwartz**: You know, we're not.
**Bschwartz**: If you're gonna start using outlets.
**Bschwartz**: And again, I'm not an electrical engineer of, you know how to break off what we're requesting to smaller amounts and things of that, so.
**David.leddy**: Okay, okay, okay.
**David.leddy**: I, I understand you don't have any.
**David.leddy**: Like, you need to check with electricians, but.
**David.leddy**: Yeah.
**Ken.mathewson**: I wouldn't recommend going down that path anyway.
**Ken.mathewson**: When you start mixing loads like that, it.
**Ken.mathewson**: It just opens up the potential for.
**Ken.mathewson**: For greater failures.
**Ken.mathewson**: You're talking about adding a print, an outlet for printers to a, to a panel that controls your whole system.
**Ken.mathewson**: If something happens in that outlet that, that causes a fault and takes down the whole system.
**Ken.mathewson**: Instead of just having an outage with your printer, you've taken down half of your Skypod system.
**Ken.mathewson**: So it's.
**Ken.mathewson**: It's probably best that those printer drops get pulled from that panel that, that we've designated for that power and not from Skypod stuff or exotect stuff.
**Ken.mathewson**: Excuse me.
**Ken.mathewson**: Okay.
**David.leddy**: So I think we haven't finalized the power feed for this location yet, so we have to think about how to do it.
**David.leddy**: This one.
**Race.kangas**: Yeah.
**Ken.mathewson**: If you can get us those power requirements like Ahmed said, we won't be able to get them in the out to permit set, but we can issue a bulletin afterwards for Aliato, and it should.
**Ken.mathewson**: It'll probably be a little bit of an adder, but it won't be a huge cost addition.
**Ken.mathewson**: But I think we've got a number of solutions that, that would work to.
**Ken.mathewson**: To add some additional outlets for those printers.
**Bcritzman**: But again, it raises a big question still that we never discussed.
**Bcritzman**: How can we mount the outlets to the sides of the conveyor if we're not allowed to connect to it?
**Bcritzman**: So where would these outlets reside?
**Bschwartz**: I mean, you, you can always drill into the, you know, to mount them to the legs of the conveyor.
**Bschwartz**: I mean, you just can't run it.
**Bschwartz**: We don't, we don't prefer that you run it through the conveyor.
**Bcritzman**: Got it.
**Race.kangas**: But.
**Bcritzman**: So it can have a.
**Bcritzman**: The drops down and then it's just the boxes.
**Bschwartz**: You can mount it wherever you want.
**Bschwartz**: We're not worried about the mounting.
**Bschwartz**: We just don't want the, the, the electric to be, you know, ran along.
**Bcritzman**: Yeah, I gotcha.
**Ken.mathewson**: Even if mounting to the, the structure of the.
**Ken.mathewson**: The conveyor wasn't an option, we could.
**Ken.mathewson**: The EC could provide a small unistrut frame and just mount up the back box and the receptacle to that underneath a.
**Ken.mathewson**: In a desk or, or a Table or whatever the printer is going to sit on.
**Bcritzman**: Sure.
**Bcritzman**: All right, so then on the next weekly poll which will be set up by Aliato, what we'll do is, is let them know that, you know, there is a forthcoming bulletin that's just going to provide power to these conveyors and then we'll see how that pans out and we'll try to get that out the door before they start mobilizing.
**Bcritzman**: So then we keep everything fluid Yusuka.
**Bcritzman**: Anything else you want to go over.
**David.leddy**: I need to discuss with Damian first.
**David.leddy**: And let me come back to you.
**David.leddy**: For the cable drop the printers around the conveyor in the south park.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Currently the Skype power supply is north, sideways 2 and the south side is 2.
**Joseph.burdzy**: My understanding is correct.
**Ken.mathewson**: Can you repeat your question?
**Ken.mathewson**: I didn't catch that.
**Ken.mathewson**: I'm sorry.
**Joseph.burdzy**: For Skypus power supply, no side is two, south side is two.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Is this correct?
**Race.kangas**: Yep.
**Ken.mathewson**: Right now we've got two sky pods on the north, stucco, two sky pods on the south and same thing with the sky path.
**Ken.mathewson**: Two south, two north.
**Bschwartz**: Yeah, that's how it was originally designed.
**Bschwartz**: Mind?
**Joseph.burdzy**: Yeah, yeah.
**Bschwartz**: We will go over that again I think definitely when you guys come.
**Bschwartz**: But I think that we found a more efficient way to use it and maybe move one of those to the south.
**Bschwartz**: So we'll have three on the south, 200 or one on the top, but it'll still be the same number of drops.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Same number, but maybe the wire rings will change.
**Bryan.wagar**: Right, so correct.
**Bschwartz**: And that was for, I think that was for E stop as well to make it a little easier based on how you wanted it set up.
**Joseph.burdzy**: So this is another discussion point.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Right.
**Joseph.burdzy**: We need to.
**Bschwartz**: Power dimensioning is one of the main, main topics of our discussion Tuesday and Wednesday of next week.
**Ken.mathewson**: Joe, when will that information be available where that drops moving?
**Bschwartz**: I'm hoping by the end of next week we'll at least know where it's going to be.
**Bschwartz**: And we should know.
**Bschwartz**: I know at the Moment we're doing 400 at every location, but I think, I think one of them may, one or two of them might jump to 480.
**Bschwartz**: But we're getting clarification on that right now.
**Ken.mathewson**: Okay.
**Ken.mathewson**: Yeah, that's information we'll need to know.
**Bschwartz**: Right.
**Ken.mathewson**: Number, number one, if we're moving locations, since we're, we're dropping those step down transformers in certain locations.
**Ken.mathewson**: So if we need to move one of those and if, if, if some of those drops are changing from 400 volt to 480 volt, that actually will save fast Retail a little bit of money because we can feed those directly out of those panels instead of providing a step down transformer.
**David.leddy**: Yeah.
**Bschwartz**: And that's what we're trying to do.
**Bschwartz**: We're trying to figure out if it is.
**Bschwartz**: If it is possible.
**Bschwartz**: We've been working with our vendors on their equipment to see if they can handle it.
**Bschwartz**: And you know, we all.
**Bschwartz**: We know that is the simplest way.
**Race.kangas**: Let's.
**Race.kangas**: Let's just switch them all to 480.
**Ken.mathewson**: Joe.
**Ken.mathewson**: Make it easy on everybody.
**David.leddy**: I wish.
**Bschwartz**: I wish.
**Ken.mathewson**: Ahmed.
**Ken.mathewson**: That's something we'll track for that.
**Ken.mathewson**: That bulletin as well.
**Ken.mathewson**: So we'll need to pass that along to Aliato next week.
**Bcritzman**: Yeah, I think.
**Bcritzman**: I think you, Suke and Joe.
**Bcritzman**: Whenever that information is somewhat ready, let's hop on a call the entire team.
**Bcritzman**: Show us exactly what we need to get done.
**Bcritzman**: We will update it.
**Bcritzman**: We'll issue the bulletin and then we'll see how that all pans out with Alato.
**David.leddy**: Can you just hang on for a second after everybody.
**Bcritzman**: Do you have any other questions for the rest of the team though at this time?
**Bcritzman**: Yusuke.
**Joseph.burdzy**: 1 question and 4 work station.
**David.leddy**: There are.
**Joseph.burdzy**: There are drop point.
**David.leddy**: Can you repeat that one more time?
**Joseph.burdzy**: For.
**Joseph.burdzy**: For workstation.
**Ken.mathewson**: There are.
**Joseph.burdzy**: On the drop point of power supply.
**Bcritzman**: Yes, there is.
**Bcritzman**: There's on each side of the workstation.
**Bcritzman**: So you have two facing each other.
**Bcritzman**: Each side will.
**Bcritzman**: Well, one side will have a drop down of a quad and data.
**Bcritzman**: Right Brian?
**Joseph.burdzy**: Same.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Same Drop point is the same as the Skypass drop point.
**Race.kangas**: Yeah.
**Ken.mathewson**: Each.
**Ken.mathewson**: Each pair of desks will have a quad and two data outlets.
**Bcritzman**: And we would do the same thing as soon as we just understand at the sky path area where those exact drops will happen and then we can reflect that.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Point for workstation.
**Joseph.burdzy**: But there is no point for printer.
**Race.kangas**: If.
**Ken.mathewson**: If the print.
**Ken.mathewson**: If we were looking at Yasuke's drawing that he was sharing previously.
**Ken.mathewson**: If those printers are going to be located at the end of those conveyors in those four locations.
**Ken.mathewson**: Correct.
**Ken.mathewson**: There is no power currently in those locations.
**Ken.mathewson**: For printers we've got.
**Ken.mathewson**: We've got a quad which is four.
**Ken.mathewson**: Four plugins and a data drop for each pair of those tables Desk workstations at the four corners.
**Ken.mathewson**: But there's no power currently at the four larger triangles within the skypath system at the south end.
**David.leddy**: Okay.
**David.leddy**: Brian, how did you get the information for the power drop location for the station?
**David.leddy**: For location of the station.
**Ken.mathewson**: That was through coordination with Ahmed and yourself on what the power requirements were for each workstation.
**Bcritzman**: So when we had to call With John.
**Bcritzman**: When we had the call with John, we updated the backgrounds and we sent it to everyone.
**David.leddy**: John means John Min.
**Bcritzman**: Correct.
**Bcritzman**: It was myself, you and John Min.
**Bcritzman**: And we discussed the reduction from two quads at each desk because we had even convenience outlets for employees to be able to plug their iPhones.
**Bcritzman**: And then you guys said we don't really need to provide that for them.
**Bcritzman**: So then we reduced.
**David.leddy**: You mean in the first time we had this 4G but we'd reduced.
**Bcritzman**: No, no, we never had.
**Bcritzman**: We never showed those.
**Bcritzman**: However, Henderson shows them for the skypath, but there's no power associated for them.
**Bcritzman**: So like we don't have any power for the printers that it will serve.
**David.leddy**: Okay, that's the situation.
**David.leddy**: I understand, but what kind of document for issue?
**David.leddy**: This one.
**Ken.mathewson**: Right.
**Ken.mathewson**: We.
**Ken.mathewson**: I haven't seen this document.
**Ken.mathewson**: Isuk.
**Ken.mathewson**: The.
**Ken.mathewson**: The information we got was via the backgrounds that Ahmed put together and email conversations, call conversations with John Min.
**David.leddy**: Okay.
**David.leddy**: Okay.
**David.leddy**: So Brian Henderson didn't see any kind of document for this one?
**Ken.mathewson**: No, I.
**Ken.mathewson**: This is the first time seeing of this document.
**David.leddy**: Okay.
**David.leddy**: Okay.
**David.leddy**: Okay.
**David.leddy**: So you got the information just from Ahmed for the location of the cable drop?
**Race.kangas**: Yep.
**Ken.mathewson**: Ahmed and John Min.
**David.leddy**: Okay.
**Joseph.burdzy**: To discuss internally first.
**David.leddy**: Okay.
**Ken.mathewson**: While we're still here, Luther, are you still tracking for tomorrow for those fire production racking updates?
**Brian.hammond**: Didn't have my microphone down.
**Brian.hammond**: Yeah, I'm still tracking tomorrow.
**Brian.hammond**: It won't be early in the day, it'll be closer to the end of the day.
**Brian.hammond**: But I should have just a not 100% completed drawing, but a drawing to reflect the updated the racking updates.
**Race.kangas**: Yep.
**Ken.mathewson**: So Ahmed, we'll.
**Ken.mathewson**: We'll share that by most likely end of day tomorrow.
**Ken.mathewson**: Like an 80% progress set for Aliato with those cardboard tote racks updated for their pricing.
**Ken.mathewson**: Awesome.
**Ken.mathewson**: And then Luther and our team will work continue to work next week towards the out to permit set on Thursday.
**Bcritzman**: Sounds good.
**Bcritzman**: Yukita and Yusuke, is there anything else that we want to go over on this call while we have the entire team?
**David.leddy**: No, actually we wanted to talk about fire alarm before, but we already fixed a way forward that we for Eliato to coordinate our fire vendors with.
**David.leddy**: Yeah, I saw.
**Bcritzman**: I saw the vendor email and the relay is there, so we're good there.
**Bcritzman**: When it comes to a fire alarm is triggered, the SkyPods shut down.
**David.leddy**: Yeah, so they already include like allowance for coordination of fire alarm tabling relay system.
**David.leddy**: So.
**David.leddy**: Yeah, I'm not worrying about that right now.
**David.leddy**: So I'm clear with that one.
**David.leddy**: So I don't have any other confirmation.
**Bcritzman**: Okay.
**Bcritzman**: Yukita, anything on your end?
**Joseph.burdzy**: I'm okay, thank you.
**Bcritzman**: Brian.
**Bcritzman**: Luther, anything on your end?
**Ken.mathewson**: Joe, has there been any contact with Atlas Copco yet on those compressors?
**Bschwartz**: No, that's also something that we're finishing up the compressor.
**Bschwartz**: Just.
**Bschwartz**: It's because we're going back and forth with who we're going to use as our vendor on the shipping labels.
**Bschwartz**: The original person we were going to use did require air and to be honest, the new one that we have just got quoted actually doesn't require any air.
**Bschwartz**: So that would change how big we would need the compressors.
**Bschwartz**: So we should be finally finalizing that soon.
**Ken.mathewson**: Okay, yeah, as long as they're getting smaller and not bigger, yeah, I don't have concerns.
**Bcritzman**: All right.
**Bcritzman**: Aaron, anything on your end?
**David.leddy**: No, there's nothing on our end.
**Bcritzman**: All right, well, thank you everyone.
**Ken.mathewson**: Thanks, everyone.
**Bcritzman**: Thank you.
**Brian.hammond**: Bye.
**David.leddy**: Thank you.
**David.leddy**: You Wiktasado Amoika tpg.
