## Transcript

**Joseph BURDZY:**
Sign up sheet just to get your information so that we can cut pos for you. 

**Kebba Mass:**
Gotcha. Okay. Hey, Ahmed. 

**NAKANISHI Yusuke[FRJP:GSCM Global Logistics Support(Warehouse Development)](‰∏≠Ë•ø ÈõÑ‰∫Æ):**
Hey, Kamal. 

**Kebba Mass:**
All right, I guess we can get started. 

**Mike Parsons:**
All right, Keba. Yeah, I can jump into the job site updates. Last week the Exotech racking installation kicked off and they got up to the. They got halted at 21 upright standing. Yesterday we were able to come in behind them with our fire sprinkler team, install the sprinkler pipe on all three levels up to where the racking ends. The electrical team, they began the process. 

**Elkarrimy, Ahmed:**
For. 

**Mike Parsons:**
Running those switches for the lights. And then today they just received the wire for the the. From the change order that they needed. 

**NAKANISHI Yusuke[FRJP:GSCM Global Logistics Support(Warehouse Development)](‰∏≠Ë•ø ÈõÑ‰∫Æ):**
To. 

**Mike Parsons:**
Finish running those feeders for the transformers. Last week, on Thursday, we had the special inspection with cross check inspections. Working with Ahmed to get that completed. I think that's all I have for on site right now. Unless Exotech has anything to add. 

**Joseph BURDZY:**
No, I think you got it all. We are kind of in a pause today due to some of the lengths of the uprights being different from the last patches that we had. But our quality person is out there right now. I believe the plan right now is going to be to reset the. To reset the. The tables where they assemble everything and move forward with standing up rack tomorrow. 

**NAKANISHI Yusuke[FRJP:GSCM Global Logistics Support(Warehouse Development)](‰∏≠Ë•ø ÈõÑ‰∫Æ):**
Okay. 

**Kebba Mass:**
All right. Guess that that clarifies what we had. 

**NAKANISHI Yusuke[FRJP:GSCM Global Logistics Support(Warehouse Development)](‰∏≠Ë•ø ÈõÑ‰∫Æ):**
Here for the schedule. 

**Kebba Mass:**
So Joe, you guys would be putting up more operates starting tomorrow, you say? 

**NAKANISHI Yusuke[FRJP:GSCM Global Logistics Support(Warehouse Development)](‰∏≠Ë•ø ÈõÑ‰∫Æ):**
Correct. 

**Kebba Mass:**
Okay. All right. On the open items. Ah, I don't know if yesterday you were supposed to send us those drawings. I don't know if you guys haven't ready to distribute the CB1 drawings. 

**Elkarrimy, Ahmed:**
Yeah, they were issued yesterday, but they were. Yeah, Ben sent them. 

**Kebba Mass:**
I don't think I was on that email. 

**Joseph BURDZY:**
Check. 

**Elkarrimy, Ahmed:**
Yes, you are not on it, but the rest of the Aliato team is on it. But we'll definitely loop you in right now. 

**Kebba Mass:**
Okay. 

**Elkarrimy, Ahmed:**
Sorry about that. 

**Kebba Mass:**
All right. All right. So for the air compressor pricing, Joe, we sent you guys our. The pricing that we received from Exotype. Sorry, from Henderson. 

**NAKANISHI Yusuke[FRJP:GSCM Global Logistics Support(Warehouse Development)](‰∏≠Ë•ø ÈõÑ‰∫Æ):**
Yep. 

**Joseph BURDZY:**
No, I'm reviewing it. I'm reviewing it with the team. We're going over a few things and then we'll. We'll definitely move forward. Probably move forward with it. I just need a couple more people to say. Okay. And just to clarify it, I know Brandon said yes to everything, but you will be pulling the permit and getting it stamped as well, just to make sure. 

**Kebba Mass:**
Yes, that's my understanding. Correct me if I'm wrong, Brian. 

**Bryan Wagar:**
No, that should be correct. 

**Elkarrimy, Ahmed:**
How much? 

**Joseph BURDZY:**
Just curious. How much do permits usually run with these kind of things. 

**NAKANISHI Yusuke[FRJP:GSCM Global Logistics Support(Warehouse Development)](‰∏≠Ë•ø ÈõÑ‰∫Æ):**
That. 

**Bryan Wagar:**
That I'm not sure about. We'd have to check with. We'd have to have Aliato check with the jurisdiction. 

**Kebba Mass:**
Yeah, I can. I can find that out tomorrow. Reach out to the building department. 

**NAKANISHI Yusuke[FRJP:GSCM Global Logistics Support(Warehouse Development)](‰∏≠Ë•ø ÈõÑ‰∫Æ):**
Okay. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Honestly, we already have a plumbing permit, so this will be just a revision to the drawings and just increase the scope. So they may want to charge just a little bit of money for the cost of work, which they base it on, but I don't see it being that much. 

**NAKANISHI Yusuke[FRJP:GSCM Global Logistics Support(Warehouse Development)](‰∏≠Ë•ø ÈõÑ‰∫Æ):**
Joe, Joe, do you remember there's a yellow line around the air compressor? Yep. Can we place the air compressor within the yellow line? Is that possible? 

**Joseph BURDZY:**
That's the plan. 

**Kebba Mass:**
Okay. 

**NAKANISHI Yusuke[FRJP:GSCM Global Logistics Support(Warehouse Development)](‰∏≠Ë•ø ÈõÑ‰∫Æ):**
Okay. Okay. How about the location of the bollards? It's possible to hopefully. 

**Joseph BURDZY:**
I mean, let's. Let's get this design first and then we could talk about bollards. 

**NAKANISHI Yusuke[FRJP:GSCM Global Logistics Support(Warehouse Development)](‰∏≠Ë•ø ÈõÑ‰∫Æ):**
Okay, but. But the location of the air compressor within the yellow line, right? 

**Joseph BURDZY:**
Yeah, that's. That's the idea at this moment is to keep it within that box. 

**NAKANISHI Yusuke[FRJP:GSCM Global Logistics Support(Warehouse Development)](‰∏≠Ë•ø ÈõÑ‰∫Æ):**
Okay. Okay. Okay. 

**Elkarrimy, Ahmed:**
Because that's. 

**Joseph BURDZY:**
That's where the drain is anyways. That's where it has to go. And I'm fingers crossed that this air compressor is not going to be larger than that yellow box because that's a. That's a good amount of space. 

**NAKANISHI Yusuke[FRJP:GSCM Global Logistics Support(Warehouse Development)](‰∏≠Ë•ø ÈõÑ‰∫Æ):**
Okay. 

**Kebba Mass:**
All right. On billing, we. We sent the July billing after revising the insurance change order, which is now approved. So either tonight or tomorrow, Kevin will send over the billing for August. And Joe, as you mentioned, so once we receive the W9 and the PO, we're going to send out the billing for that change order. 

**Joseph BURDZY:**
For the electrical change order, I just sent over the W9 just a minute ago. And Brandon, I believe, has to fill out a form for us to get you uploaded into the system and then we can cut a PO for you. So as soon as we get that back, we can. We can place something. 

**Kebba Mass:**
Sounds good. I'll talk to Brandon about that tomorrow. Maybe I can fill it out. 

**NAKANISHI Yusuke[FRJP:GSCM Global Logistics Support(Warehouse Development)](‰∏≠Ë•ø ÈõÑ‰∫Æ):**
Send. 

**Kebba Mass:**
Send it out. Send it back to you guys. So on the submittals, we just started the. We restarted the process for the electrical change order, so electrical submittals and probably by Friday we will have that uploaded on Job Planner for Henderson and TPG to review. And for the anchor bowls, we. I just uploaded those on Job Planner and it's waiting for AUE to review. And that's all for now. If anyone have any comments, questions. 

**Elkarrimy, Ahmed:**
Yeah, let me jump in for a little Bit. So I was on site today, and I walked with Mike, Yusuke, and the exotech team. It was a very good walkthrough. So I'll start with the inspection report, and then we'll dive into certain things that we just need to check on while we're on site. 

**NAKANISHI Yusuke[FRJP:GSCM Global Logistics Support(Warehouse Development)](‰∏≠Ë•ø ÈõÑ‰∫Æ):**
Great. 

**Elkarrimy, Ahmed:**
So inspections wise, the. When I spoke to Christopher from Crosscheck, he had no issues with the means and methods, but he wanted to just make sure that structural engineering reviews some sort of a submittal that shows that this is the way that we're installing it. This is the size of the bolts. This is the size of everything, which I think he outlines every little piece that was used. Aaron, as well, in that inspection report. If you do load it up, it does tell you exactly how the team on site built the anchor bolts for the racks. So this will kind of help you. Also, while you're reviewing this upcoming submittal for the anchor bolts conduit attachment. I know me and Mike and Yusuke spoke about this. You guys are ordering another, like one of those anchors for the wall, for the wall connections. And then when we call in our next inspection, we'll demonstrate that means and methods of connecting it. Right now, the last item is the slab edge work that's by the. By the drain. So there's a detail that's on the structural drawings, I believe, that basically says that when you add the rebar, there needs to be an epoxy connection between the two pieces that are sticking out of the slab that were put into the edge, the slab edge. So he believes that the way that it was done is somewhat not the right way to be done. So I know Aaron. I spoke to John Armour about this in the morning, and I asked him to issue an RFI to have you guys review this a little more in depth, just to determine if we need to rip that concrete out and do the work correctly or if this is something that can be accepted based off of slab on grade. And I don't believe there was rebar previously. So I just wanted to just see what. What you guys think is the best path forward for this. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Ahmed, can you say that first part? I missed it. 

**NAKANISHI Yusuke[FRJP:GSCM Global Logistics Support(Warehouse Development)](‰∏≠Ë•ø ÈõÑ‰∫Æ):**
What. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
What is the inspector saying is wrong because we're taking an unreinforced slab and simply dowling into it. 

**NAKANISHI Yusuke[FRJP:GSCM Global Logistics Support(Warehouse Development)](‰∏≠Ë•ø ÈõÑ‰∫Æ):**
Yeah, what we. 

**Elkarrimy, Ahmed:**
I'll explain it. I'll explain it. Watch. Because like I did, I argued with him on the phone a little bit, and then he was like, no, it might cave in. And honestly, I think Aaron, or if John Armor is On the call, they can chime in about it more. But basically, where's. 

**NAKANISHI Yusuke[FRJP:GSCM Global Logistics Support(Warehouse Development)](‰∏≠Ë•ø ÈõÑ‰∫Æ):**
Where's my tools? Can I use tools here? 

**Elkarrimy, Ahmed:**
If this is your slab edge. 

**NAKANISHI Yusuke[FRJP:GSCM Global Logistics Support(Warehouse Development)](‰∏≠Ë•ø ÈõÑ‰∫Æ):**
Or. 

**Elkarrimy, Ahmed:**
Your trench, I'm sorry. And you added. You doweled in from this side only to this much, and then you dialed from this much over here, and then you infilled with concrete. The concern is that all of this is going to cave down. Cave down, and then there's going to be an indentation in the concrete in couple of years. So no way. Usually. What usually happens is that they connect them together to create a sturdy surface before you pour back. So I just want you guys to issue the RFI and let's have a ue review it to see if the way that it was done is acceptable or if the connection needs to happen to avoid that caving of the slab. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Well, that would be like saying the entire slab's going to cave because there's no rebar in it. 

**Elkarrimy, Ahmed:**
Yes. But when you take out. When you take out slab from a non reinforced concrete slab, when you tie it back in, the earth can take it down if it's not reinforced correctly, that just that L shape will go down the rest of your. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
This is from the inside. 

**Elkarrimy, Ahmed:**
Yeah, this is per the structural engineer. So I just want you guys to issue it formally and let's have them review it and see if the way that it was installed is acceptable or not. That's what Crosscheck wants to hear from Aue if it is or not. But having a conversation with Aue high level, he did not see that this is the proper means and methods for the installation. 

**NAKANISHI Yusuke[FRJP:GSCM Global Logistics Support(Warehouse Development)](‰∏≠Ë•ø ÈõÑ‰∫Æ):**
Okay. Okay. 

**Elkarrimy, Ahmed:**
So that was transition rebar. We talked about the anchor bolts, the lights. So when we were on site. 

**Mike Parsons:**
Yeah, man. 

**Elkarrimy, Ahmed:**
Yeah, sorry. 

**Mike Parsons:**
I bet. Yeah. I walked the site afterwards with Sean again and verified those light locations. And yeah, I. I'm gonna get them straightened out and I got you. 

**NAKANISHI Yusuke[FRJP:GSCM Global Logistics Support(Warehouse Development)](‰∏≠Ë•ø ÈõÑ‰∫Æ):**
Yeah. Okay. Just. 

**Elkarrimy, Ahmed:**
I just needed to say for the team here, but it's all good. 

**NAKANISHI Yusuke[FRJP:GSCM Global Logistics Support(Warehouse Development)](‰∏≠Ë•ø ÈõÑ‰∫Æ):**
Yeah. So. 

**Elkarrimy, Ahmed:**
So the lights will just shift accordingly. We have a nice slow week here, so I think we can definitely get that done as soon as possible. So I don't see an issue with that. 

**NAKANISHI Yusuke[FRJP:GSCM Global Logistics Support(Warehouse Development)](‰∏≠Ë•ø ÈõÑ‰∫Æ):**
Right. Okay. 

**Elkarrimy, Ahmed:**
And then, Yusuke, regarding our conversation about Henderson's visit to the site, do you still think it's necessary at this time or should we hold off until like we actually have more rack movement and more sprinkler scope installed? 

**NAKANISHI Yusuke[FRJP:GSCM Global Logistics Support(Warehouse Development)](‰∏≠Ë•ø ÈõÑ‰∫Æ):**
Yeah, we can hold on till a little bit more construction progress. 

**Bryan Wagar:**
Is okay. Are you good with late November, early December still. 

**NAKANISHI Yusuke[FRJP:GSCM Global Logistics Support(Warehouse Development)](‰∏≠Ë•ø ÈõÑ‰∫Æ):**
Yeah, something like that. Yeah. Okay. 

**Bryan Wagar:**
Yeah, I think that's probably going to be our best time period for that first. First visit. Assuming that construction stays on schedule, that'll put us out there somewhere around the time of System B being completed and a little ahead of System A being started. So I think that's the best opportunity for us to get out there and make the most efficient use of our visit. 

**Kebba Mass:**
Yes. 

**NAKANISHI Yusuke[FRJP:GSCM Global Logistics Support(Warehouse Development)](‰∏≠Ë•ø ÈõÑ‰∫Æ):**
Yes. Okay. Okay. 

**Kebba Mass:**
All right. Any other questions or comments? 

**NAKANISHI Yusuke[FRJP:GSCM Global Logistics Support(Warehouse Development)](‰∏≠Ë•ø ÈõÑ‰∫Æ):**
No. You're okay with the schedule? Have you. Have you already talked to Alieto about schedule updates or if any. 

**Elkarrimy, Ahmed:**
Regarding. 

**Joseph BURDZY:**
We talked about it while I was out there. If it would be an issue switching and going from almost finishing, because it's a different kind of sprinkler that goes in the 500. 500 racking and. And starting the other Skypod and then going back once the equipment comes in. So I don't think that'll be an issue. I will give Mike and Keba and team well ahead to let them know what the plan is so that. Because I know you order the piping, you know, a couple weeks in advance, but as of now, yes, we are going to pivot. Come. Come later in October, but we are trying to get those dates pulled in for the. The other racking to just keep the old schedule. 

**NAKANISHI Yusuke[FRJP:GSCM Global Logistics Support(Warehouse Development)](‰∏≠Ë•ø ÈõÑ‰∫Æ):**
Okay. 

**Joseph BURDZY:**
So it's a small pivot, two aisles, so it shouldn't. Shouldn't be too much of a nuisance. 

**Kebba Mass:**
Anything else? 

**NAKANISHI Yusuke[FRJP:GSCM Global Logistics Support(Warehouse Development)](‰∏≠Ë•ø ÈõÑ‰∫Æ):**
You seek it? I think I'm good. 

**Kebba Mass:**
All right, Ahmed. 

**Elkarrimy, Ahmed:**
I'm good on my end. Thank you, guys. 

**NAKANISHI Yusuke[FRJP:GSCM Global Logistics Support(Warehouse Development)](‰∏≠Ë•ø ÈõÑ‰∫Æ):**
Okay, both face. 

**Kebba Mass:**
No more comments. We'll cut it off here. 

**Elkarrimy, Ahmed:**
Thank you, guys. 

**NAKANISHI Yusuke[FRJP:GSCM Global Logistics Support(Warehouse Development)](‰∏≠Ë•ø ÈõÑ‰∫Æ):**
Thanks, everybody. 

**Kebba Mass:**
Thank you. 

**Bryan Wagar:**
Thanks, everyone. 

**NAKANISHI Yusuke[FRJP:GSCM Global Logistics Support(Warehouse Development)](‰∏≠Ë•ø ÈõÑ‰∫Æ):**
Appreciate it. Thank you.
