**Bclymer**: I was like, jesus, yeah, where you at?
**Jimparker8101977**: I mean, that kind of hair.
**Jimparker8101977**: Jesse, how can you attract a 20 something year old girl?
**Bclymer**: Those days are over, I'm afraid.
**Bclymer**: Unless I go to Colombia, then it's not a problem anymore.
**Jimparker8101977**: So, Brandon, Jesse and I have worked or worked around each other for many, many years.
**Jimparker8101977**: And yeah, he was.
**Jimparker8101977**: He was going to Russia to go find a wife on one of the trips.
**Bclymer**: That was Latvia, by the way.
**Bclymer**: We lost you, Jim.
**Jimparker8101977**: Oh, sorry.
**Jimparker8101977**: Yeah, yeah, just an interesting.
**Jimparker8101977**: That was Lafia.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Oh, she's the hottest chick I've ever seen in my life.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I bet.
**Bclymer**: I bet.
**Bclymer**: Where are you at right now?
**Bclymer**: You walking around job site or what?
**Jimparker8101977**: I'm, you know, not as.
**Bclymer**: You'Re breaking.
**Jimparker8101977**: Up as good as you guys, you know, sitting there with office.
**Jimparker8101977**: I don't have an office.
**Bclymer**: Hey, Jim, you're breaking up a little bit.
**Jimparker8101977**: Y there.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jimparker8101977**: Jesse, can you hear me?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, we can hear you kind of.
**Bclymer**: You're breaking up pretty bad.
**Jimparker8101977**: Now.
**Bclymer**: We've lost you.
**Jimparker8101977**: I've got y' all now.
**Jimparker8101977**: This is weird.
**Jimparker8101977**: Usually I have really good calls.
**Jimparker8101977**: Okay, great.
**Bclymer**: Can you hear us now?
**Jimparker8101977**: Yeah, I got y' all now.
**Bclymer**: Where'd you say you are?
**Bclymer**: We didn't hear you.
**Jimparker8101977**: All right, so what's going on, guys?
**Jimparker8101977**: I'm in Greenville.
**Jimparker8101977**: Oh, my goodness.
**Jimparker8101977**: Yeah, I work remotely for Layton right now.
**Jimparker8101977**: And I'm in the middle of going to do whatever I need to do for my wife.
**Bclymer**: Nice area.
**Jimparker8101977**: I know it's ridiculous some days.
**Jimparker8101977**: So I hear that y' all planted a bunch of work, Brandon.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah, we actually.
**Bclymer**: We just had another call today with Siba Logistics is one of our clients.
**Bclymer**: So they've got a new building that they're wanting to move into in Phoenix, Arizona area.
**Bclymer**: So, yeah, they called me yesterday as soon as I got off the plane and like, hey, we need to get moving on this building.
**Bclymer**: You know, blah, blah.
**Bclymer**: So, yeah, we've let me, you know, good little job and then we've got, you know, Paradise Isles.
**Bclymer**: That text me about that loi here earlier today, actually.
**Bclymer**: So, yeah, we've been.
**Bclymer**: We've been fortunate.
**Bclymer**: You know, we're steady growth and I mean, really, I'd say the biggest handicap to our growth is the fact that, you know, keep getting pulled into the operations.
**Bclymer**: You know, it's.
**Bclymer**: It's.
**Bclymer**: I mean, I can't remember the last time I really did business development.
**Bclymer**: It's not often.
**Jimparker8101977**: It sounds like Your operations ability speaks for itself.
**Jimparker8101977**: And you're getting repeat clients.
**Jimparker8101977**: They're just handing you the work hand over fist.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah, I mean we, we always get repeat clients.
**Bclymer**: I mean we, you know, I drive a really, really hard standard, you know, with the guys and making sure that hey, like we over deliver, right.
**Bclymer**: We're not, we're not like everybody else in reactive.
**Jimparker8101977**: Well, you have one of the hardest working men that I know on your right hand side right there.
**Jimparker8101977**: Jesse.
**Bclymer**: You know Nick.
**Bclymer**: How does he.
**Bclymer**: No, I, I know it.
**Bclymer**: I mean I remember I used to work for Jesse.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, work for Jesse.
**Bclymer**: And we'd sit there and you know, I, I was like always like, oh, I gotta be my boss in the office.
**Bclymer**: And this comes in the next day.
**Bclymer**: Nope, earlier than me.
**Bclymer**: And like then I'm like, next thing you know it's like we're getting there at like 5:45.
**Bclymer**: I'm like, what are we doing?
**Bclymer**: Why are we doing this?
**Jimparker8101977**: Oh, he was listening to Italian, trying to learn how to speak Italian whenever I was there and he was beating me to work.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: No it's, it's great.
**Bclymer**: You know, Jesse's been almost a year now.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, almost a year.
**Bclymer**: Like it's crazy how much we grown in the last year.
**Jimparker8101977**: So Brandon, what is your volume right now?
**Jimparker8101977**: I mean you doing like 40, 50 right now.
**Bclymer**: I mean what we say we're gonna do, I mean depending on obviously like for instance, like we've got like you know, one ten million dollar job that should be started by now, but now it might be a month later.
**Bclymer**: So depending on when the billing cycles end, you know, in the calendar year, I would expect us to do somewhere between minimum, I'd say 20 this year to high end of 40.
**Jimparker8101977**: That's still.
**Jimparker8101977**: And how many guys do you have there besides Jesse?
**Jimparker8101977**: I know he operates as like 10 guys, but still.
**Bclymer**: So as far as ops go, like, so we have one project engineer, one APM, three PMs, five supers, one estimator, and then me and Jesse.
**Bclymer**: So you know, whatever, 12, 12 guys I guess on the ops.
**Jimparker8101977**: And then are you staffing these jobs yourself with your own manpower too?
**Jimparker8101977**: Because I know y' all do a good bit of fire sprinkler and some other random trade stuff.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, so the like first the sprinkler division, the way that we do that is I've kind of carved out a little niche because we, we don't do like any, like we wouldn't do a sprinkler in an office.
**Bclymer**: Like we only do it for like ASRs systems, which is automatic robotic automatic retrieval sorting systems.
**Bclymer**: Like, are you familiar with that at all?
**Jimparker8101977**: Basically, that's the stuff that you did at Lilly, at Rogers over there.
**Bclymer**: Oh, for Pratt Whitney.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yes, yes, exactly.
**Jimparker8101977**: And so high end stuff.
**Bclymer**: Yes, yes.
**Bclymer**: And so, so we've carved out a niche in that market.
**Bclymer**: And so we like, we'll design it.
**Bclymer**: I have a designer and so we'll design it and then I will source.
**Jimparker8101977**: The.
**Bclymer**: Material from whatever fabricator and so we'll provide the material and then we'll hire a local sprinkler company.
**Bclymer**: We'll send out a guy superintendent as well, but we'll hire local manpower.
**Bclymer**: And it, I mean it tends to work out really well because as you probably know, one of the biggest issues with subcontractors is cash flow.
**Bclymer**: And when I tell them like, no, no drawings are done and I'm buying all the material, I just need your manpower, I mean they, they jump at it.
**Jimparker8101977**: Well, that's amazing because we just, we have a hard time with that because we have, you know, we're competing against Turner and all these other big.
**Jimparker8101977**: And they're buying the material too for them, but then they're, they're doubling up on the fees and everything for that material.
**Jimparker8101977**: You know, like air handlers or switch gear, yada, yada, yada.
**Jimparker8101977**: Turner's buying all that stuff and making a profit on the turn too.
**Jimparker8101977**: But some of these larger contractors are kind of don't like that mentality sometimes.
**Jimparker8101977**: But the sprinkler guys for sure, they love that piece because that's the hardest thing for them to do is to get it fabricated and on site and everything else.
**Bclymer**: Yep, yep.
**Bclymer**: And so I mean we make, I mean that stuff, we make, I mean, great margins on that.
**Bclymer**: I mean we've got one right now where the sprinkler portion of work is like 2.3 million ish and our costs are like 114 maybe.
**Jimparker8101977**: That sounds like awful margins.
**Bclymer**: Your two and a half percent is pretty attractive, Jim, that you guys charge.
**Bclymer**: But yeah, no, I get you on.
**Jimparker8101977**: The back side when we go to Vegas and put that on red.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jimparker8101977**: Subs.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: No, that's one thing that it like we, our margins for the, for the size of company, like the revenue that we do are I'd say a little bit, you know, pretty good.
**Bclymer**: Amount above average.
**Bclymer**: I, I'm very like particular about not just doing work to do work.
**Bclymer**: That's part of the reason why we also run lean.
**Bclymer**: We use a lot of, you know, either offshore help or AI, whatever kind of technology we can do to keep overhead low, you know, has really helped us grow.
**Bclymer**: And again, I'm really big on protecting and growing the margin everywhere you can get.
**Bclymer**: And that niche infrastructure piece has really helped too, because some of these projects will make 40% on.
**Jimparker8101977**: I've only dreamed of 40%.
**Jimparker8101977**: I mean, my biggest one I've ever done was 35% and was a hard bid job.
**Jimparker8101977**: And I had two numbers and we sat in the parking lot and figured out nobody was building a job except for us.
**Jimparker8101977**: We gave them the.
**Jimparker8101977**: The big number.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, no, I mean, you know, the.
**Bclymer**: We just did a sprinkler project in Burnville and it's like 1.1 million, I think at the end of the day, because we kind of up some stuff, but I think we'll be at, I don't know, half a million or so, you know, 40, maybe 400 grand on the profit.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, something like that.
**Bclymer**: It took about what, six, eight weeks?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, it was quick, too.
**Bclymer**: It's not like you're around for a couple years to get something built.
**Jimparker8101977**: And that's the whole thing is, I mean, you've got it figured out, Brandon.
**Jimparker8101977**: I mean, why are you wanting to go into bigger construction now?
**Bclymer**: Well, so I'm a firm believer in diversification, you know, so it.
**Bclymer**: Plus I love building things.
**Bclymer**: You know what, When I'm doing a sprinkler for an ASR system like at Pratt Whitney, right?
**Bclymer**: Like, that's not sexy.
**Bclymer**: Like, I don't like it, but it's good money.
**Bclymer**: Like that.
**Bclymer**: That's Pratt Whitney job.
**Bclymer**: You know, again, I think we made 35, 40% on it probably, you know, and so maybe not.
**Bclymer**: Maybe we did 30 on that one because I think I gave a discount.
**Bclymer**: So, yeah, I mean, I'm gonna keep growing that division because it is so profitable and it allows us, for instance, like this building that we just got today, this ground up warehouse that Jesse Whitney looked at.
**Bclymer**: Like I told him, I said, let's go skinny on this because, you know, I want to.
**Bclymer**: It's a referral from another client.
**Bclymer**: Like I want to get in there.
**Bclymer**: And because we have other things, it allows us to do that.
**Bclymer**: Like we don't always have to, you know, be super, super big on everything.
**Bclymer**: We can take, you know, some chips off the table and allow us to grow different divisions.
**Bclymer**: So if something slows down, we've always got different things to do.
**Bclymer**: To do.
**Jimparker8101977**: Well, that's just, that's super cool, Brandon.
**Jimparker8101977**: And I just, I'm very proud of what You've done.
**Jimparker8101977**: And Jesse just speaks highly of you and it's, I mean, he doesn't do that often, by the way.
**Jimparker8101977**: And he hates working for people that he.
**Jimparker8101977**: Were, he, they were working for him.
**Jimparker8101977**: Like he fucking hates talking to me because he knows I'm his boss.
**Jimparker8101977**: Motherfucker.
**Bclymer**: That's right.
**Jimparker8101977**: He wants to right the ship and me to be, you know, working for him again.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So I obviously co workers, Jim.
**Bclymer**: That's all.
**Jimparker8101977**: Yeah, right.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jimparker8101977**: I remember days.
**Bclymer**: He'S gonna, he's gonna, he's gonna get you in.
**Bclymer**: And then all of a sudden MJ Harris, Mike Harris was always a superintendent, so in that company, the superintendents were always in charge.
**Bclymer**: Oh, yeah.
**Jimparker8101977**: Yes.
**Jimparker8101977**: Yeah.
**Jimparker8101977**: I was his little beaten boy.
**Jimparker8101977**: But I don't know, I'm, I'm excited to hear more about what you got.
**Jimparker8101977**: And Jesse says that you've won, y' all won a ton of work and that's what you're looking for me for.
**Jimparker8101977**: I do have references and I have people that I can bring with me, have other staff and superintendents and yada, yada, yada that can help you grow.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I mean, and that's, you know, that's kind of, you know what, you know what?
**Bclymer**: I was talking to Jesse and we were like, all right, we probably need to bring in, you know, some senior level guys.
**Bclymer**: And you know, we thought about you, you know, kind of, that's what our thought is.
**Bclymer**: So, you know, in reality, kind of what we're looking at is, is, you know, if you, you know, you coming in, you know, as a VP and, and pretty much everybody kind of reports to you and Jesse, it'll, you know, have to transition.
**Bclymer**: Obviously it's going to take some, I think, a little time to, you know, compared to what you're used to, where you're using, doing 600 million dollar jobs versus now, it's like, all right, now there's, you know, whatever 25 jobs and they're, you know, between a million and, you know, 12 million or whatever, at least until Paradise Isle starts, which, I mean, that won't break ground for that poor collective is 30 million.
**Bclymer**: Oh, yeah, yeah, I guess that's.
**Bclymer**: We're getting an loi Monday.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, well, or maybe today.
**Bclymer**: He said today.
**Bclymer**: Or Monday.
**Bclymer**: They said Monday at the latest.
**Bclymer**: So, yeah, I mean, there, I guess there are some, some bigger jobs, but I guess also again, like, you know, there are some small jobs like, yeah, uniqlo is only 3 million, you know, 3.3.
**Bclymer**: But granted, we're making a million on It.
**Jimparker8101977**: You know, but, Brandon, that's where.
**Jimparker8101977**: I mean, I hate to tell you, but my career has been based on smaller projects.
**Jimparker8101977**: When I was at NJ, I was running 22 jobs at once as the project manager and turning 22 pay apps, yada, yada, yada.
**Jimparker8101977**: And turning them quick, too.
**Jimparker8101977**: So I'm familiar with that from my MJ days.
**Jimparker8101977**: Right now at Leighton, I'm running like, seven jobs.
**Jimparker8101977**: Maybe.
**Jimparker8101977**: Maybe it's more than that, but it's around almost $3 billion worth of work that I've got.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, that's awesome.
**Jimparker8101977**: It is, but it's also.
**Jimparker8101977**: It comes with a whole bunch.
**Jimparker8101977**: I'm more of a HR person than I am with construction.
**Jimparker8101977**: It's fucking.
**Jimparker8101977**: This guy talked to me like that.
**Jimparker8101977**: That guy called me this so and so, told me to make prints, and I don't want to make prints.
**Jimparker8101977**: And just like, oh, my God, it's so dramatic.
**Jimparker8101977**: And I don't feel like that Jesse brings that kind of people to the table.
**Jimparker8101977**: My personal opinion.
**Bclymer**: No, they don't last long here.
**Bclymer**: If that's their.
**Bclymer**: If that's their type.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I mean, it's.
**Bclymer**: I mean, I am not a nice person.
**Bclymer**: Like, I mean, like, they're, you know, like, again, like, some of these things, like.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I mean, if these guys, you know, for whatever reason are up, I will be in their ass so fast.
**Bclymer**: So, like, yeah, I mean, we were here really clear.
**Bclymer**: Like, you know, this is like, we're here to make money, not friends.
**Bclymer**: Like, get your shit done and you'll enjoy it here.
**Jimparker8101977**: Yeah, I already have enough friends.
**Bclymer**: Exactly.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So, I mean, what's.
**Bclymer**: I guess part of my thought is, like, what are your goals?
**Bclymer**: Like, what do you want to be?
**Bclymer**: Because the biggest thing like that I told Jesse is, like, I want to make sure if Jim comes over, like, he's fully bought in, he understands what we're doing, what we're trying to build here.
**Bclymer**: Last thing I want is for somebody to come over and be like, ah, what do you mean?
**Bclymer**: You don't have this operating procedure or whatever?
**Jimparker8101977**: Well.
**Jimparker8101977**: Oh, that's.
**Jimparker8101977**: I mean, what's the program that y' all run?
**Jimparker8101977**: Y' all running?
**Jimparker8101977**: Jesse told me.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, we just.
**Bclymer**: We just switched from Procore to job planner.
**Jimparker8101977**: Okay.
**Jimparker8101977**: Well, we're running this shit called cmic, and it's like, crap.
**Jimparker8101977**: Made in Canada.
**Jimparker8101977**: It's a piece of shit.
**Jimparker8101977**: And we got away from Bluebeam.
**Jimparker8101977**: Or not Bluebeam.
**Jimparker8101977**: Excuse me, but M360 for all of our stuff for our field guys.
**Jimparker8101977**: And we're now using Construct pm.
**Jimparker8101977**: And it's a piece of shit too.
**Jimparker8101977**: So some of those softwares out there are way better.
**Jimparker8101977**: So y' all are running, I guess.
**Jimparker8101977**: Is that better than Procore?
**Bclymer**: No, it's.
**Bclymer**: It's a copycat of Procore.
**Bclymer**: It's.
**Bclymer**: But they still got some, Some bugs, right, that they're working through.
**Bclymer**: And.
**Bclymer**: But I mean, the, the cost is just a fraction.
**Bclymer**: Like, It's.
**Bclymer**: It's like 10 grand, you know, and we've got a bunch of customization and stuff like that that we're working, like having them implement and whatnot.
**Bclymer**: So it's.
**Bclymer**: It, you know, for, for the, the.
**Bclymer**: For what you get.
**Bclymer**: The price is definitely worth it, I would say.
**Jimparker8101977**: And then you are loading the plans in there and yada, yada, yada, too.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, like I said, it's.
**Bclymer**: It's literally a copycat.
**Bclymer**: Of pro course.
**Bclymer**: Just.
**Bclymer**: They, like, they just have bugs because it's a.
**Bclymer**: Our policy and procedure book is 10 pages long.
**Bclymer**: So if you can digest all of that, you know.
**Jimparker8101977**: Well, I'm going to tell you also, I'm running all this big work and it's been eons since I've loaded anything into any of these softwares to make them run too.
**Jimparker8101977**: So I, I feel like I'm a dinosaur some days whenever I'm around some of these younger children who do all the grunt work that I don't usually do.
**Jimparker8101977**: So is that something that y' all would expect me to be able to do too, is to teach them how to use your software?
**Bclymer**: I mean, no, I mean, they.
**Bclymer**: I mean, I wouldn't expect you to be able to.
**Bclymer**: I don't expect you uploading or anything.
**Bclymer**: I would expect you to know how it works and understand it.
**Jimparker8101977**: Yes, I could do that.
**Jimparker8101977**: But I'm just saying it's like.
**Bclymer**: But like, would I expect you to upload plans?
**Bclymer**: No, I don't think I've actually ever uploaded plans to jump later.
**Bclymer**: I've done it just to see how it works.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: But it's pretty easy.
**Bclymer**: It's.
**Jimparker8101977**: But, but that's the whole thing.
**Jimparker8101977**: Like, the first job I'd be part of, I would want to do all that grunt work to see how it worked so I could tell someone else how to do it.
**Jimparker8101977**: But it's still.
**Jimparker8101977**: I'm a little bit nervous if you would depend on me doing that.
**Bclymer**: No, I wouldn't.
**Bclymer**: Again, I wouldn't expect you.
**Bclymer**: I mean, the biggest thing is that, like.
**Bclymer**: So right now, I mean, Jesse and I are the, the two people that know the most about construction.
**Bclymer**: Like Any and all questions always come to us, like, and we just need to get some more high caliber people in here to really grow because again, like, you know, I, I'm pretty decent at sales, you know, but I've gotten out of it because we've got.
**Bclymer**: I don't have any time to go do any business development because I'm constantly being drug into, you know, projects.
**Bclymer**: And then even, even Jesse now too, is the same.
**Bclymer**: And so it's like, we need to bring in some other higher level people if we really want to keep growing and expanding.
**Bclymer**: You know, we've got, you know, a couple good developers that we work with and, you know, we struggle to get numbers out the door because we just, like, half the time are just so bogged down.
**Jimparker8101977**: Well, I've got, you know, I've got access to estimators and all.
**Jimparker8101977**: I got access to all kind of things just with my, you know, Rolodex of friends.
**Jimparker8101977**: And then.
**Jimparker8101977**: So, Brandon, what's your theory on construction and client relations and like that?
**Jimparker8101977**: Like, what's your theory?
**Jimparker8101977**: Like, you gonna do the right thing every time?
**Jimparker8101977**: Or what's the.
**Jimparker8101977**: Or is the mighty dollar what you chase?
**Jimparker8101977**: I mean, what's your.
**Bclymer**: Oh, no.
**Bclymer**: I mean, I have a.
**Bclymer**: I always say people before profits.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I'm a firm believer that, you know, the relationship will pay over time.
**Bclymer**: Like, just will.
**Bclymer**: As an example.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, Goodwill.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, prime example.
**Bclymer**: So Goodwill is one of our clients.
**Bclymer**: I mean.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I mean, we, you know, we make good money off them.
**Bclymer**: But for instance, like, their VP called me and he's like, hey, we need to redo our own space there where their construction facilities group is out of.
**Bclymer**: And, you know, so I said, all right, well, we'll do it for free, you know, so, you know, and we, I mean, we get back a lot and everything, but at the end of the day, like, you know, if we're wrong, we're wrong.
**Bclymer**: Like, it is what it is.
**Bclymer**: Like, we make mistakes and I'm, you know, I go out and say, hey, we made, we made a mistake.
**Bclymer**: Here it is, you know, we, we know we own it, but.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I mean, we don't.
**Bclymer**: Like, we like to pick who we work with.
**Bclymer**: We don't just go work for anybody.
**Bclymer**: And the reason for that is obviously the relationship.
**Bclymer**: Right?
**Bclymer**: Like, life is too short not to enjoy what you do.
**Bclymer**: Like, and so we don't like to work for, you know, and so that makes it a lot more enjoyable because they work for that.
**Bclymer**: Like, we had one job where our estimate messed up and the elevator line Item didn't carry down to the total.
**Bclymer**: And so I called the owner.
**Bclymer**: I was like, look, here it is.
**Bclymer**: I was like, this did not calculate.
**Bclymer**: I was like, now I will honor our price.
**Bclymer**: I was like, but I tell you right now, we didn't have this.
**Bclymer**: It didn't calculate.
**Bclymer**: And here's the error.
**Bclymer**: And he was like, nope, add it in.
**Bclymer**: I was like, okay, thank you.
**Jimparker8101977**: So, so I mean that's stand up 100 and that, you know, you're taking the fall for whoever that up too.
**Jimparker8101977**: And you stood behind him and just.
**Jimparker8101977**: That's the right thing to do.
**Jimparker8101977**: Who.
**Jimparker8101977**: Who it up, Jesse?
**Jimparker8101977**: There's no way in hell that much he doesn't fuck up.
**Bclymer**: It's.
**Bclymer**: We got rid of the canned that estimate sheet.
**Bclymer**: I'll put it on that.
**Bclymer**: We did have it.
**Bclymer**: We had a shitty estimate sheet.
**Bclymer**: And so we, we like.
**Bclymer**: Because it happened again just recently.
**Bclymer**: And I was like, done.
**Bclymer**: I was like, so we just made a new one like right there.
**Jimparker8101977**: We.
**Jimparker8101977**: So just on Monday we turned in a proposal for 80 million dollar hotel or whatever.
**Jimparker8101977**: And so estimator turned in the fucking numbers and the BD guy sent in the proposal, but he didn't let the ops guys look at it.
**Jimparker8101977**: He just sent it in, didn't even copy the ops guys.
**Jimparker8101977**: Yeah, the plumbing number ended up to be 600,000 instead of 6 million.
**Jimparker8101977**: The damn estimator fucking didn't fat finger the zeros and $1.5 million problem.
**Jimparker8101977**: Luckily they let us fix it.
**Jimparker8101977**: But who knows if we'll even get the job because of that stupid.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jimparker8101977**: So that's what happens to the best of us.
**Bclymer**: Oh yeah.
**Bclymer**: Well, that's the thing.
**Bclymer**: Like, you know, we have all these jobs going on and you know, myself and Brandon physically can't be in all of them.
**Bclymer**: So that's why we also need someone else that can get into those meetings and stop our guys from saying stuff they shouldn't or you know, the owner meetings and things like that.
**Jimparker8101977**: Okay.
**Jimparker8101977**: And then I mean, Brandon, what.
**Jimparker8101977**: Do you have any questions for me?
**Jimparker8101977**: Like, I mean, you got any.
**Jimparker8101977**: I mean I am a.
**Jimparker8101977**: I'll just tell you too.
**Jimparker8101977**: But not like Jesse.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I mean, you know, as far as like, you know, qualifications or anything.
**Bclymer**: Like, I don't really have any questions for that.
**Bclymer**: I, I trust Jesse.
**Bclymer**: He does all the hiring.
**Bclymer**: You know, my job is just to get the work and make sure that, you know, he has the, the tools and resources he needs to do everything.
**Bclymer**: You know.
**Bclymer**: The biggest thing that I.
**Bclymer**: My questions for you is like what Are your goals?
**Bclymer**: You know, what do you want to do?
**Bclymer**: Like, what attracts you to this other than the good looking guys here?
**Jimparker8101977**: I mean, I see that the, the camera's focused on you, which is you're way better looking than Jesse by far.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I'm not sure.
**Jimparker8101977**: And it is, it is Pride month, so I'm just saying.
**Jimparker8101977**: But.
**Jimparker8101977**: So right now I'm 46 years old and I have no clue what the I want to do when I grow up, you know, I have no clue.
**Jimparker8101977**: All I know is I want to make a ton of money and work with my friends and that's what I want to do in my career.
**Jimparker8101977**: I'm, you know, I don't like being fucking told what to do and any of that shit.
**Jimparker8101977**: I like to have free will and be able to operate the way that I feel is fit.
**Jimparker8101977**: So that's what, what I think and what I'm looking for is I'm looking to make a shit ton of money, work with a bunch of my buddies and make all this, you know, go from there.
**Bclymer**: How much is a shit ton of money?
**Jimparker8101977**: I don't have a clue.
**Jimparker8101977**: I don't even know what a shit ton of money is.
**Jimparker8101977**: I'm still up in the air on that.
**Bclymer**: I know you don't know, but if you did know, what would you say?
**Jimparker8101977**: So right now, like six or seven hundred thousand dollars is what I would think would be a shit ton of money.
**Jimparker8101977**: So that's like my next level at Layton is VP and I've won a shit ton of work and I've done a really good job and I'm about to be there.
**Jimparker8101977**: And that's supposedly in the realm of.
**Bclymer**: Possibilities, is you getting promoted to VP up there.
**Jimparker8101977**: Yeah, vp.
**Jimparker8101977**: And that's kind of, you know, they make probably about 250, 300, but then their bonus structure puts them around 600.
**Bclymer**: And so I guess if, if you're about ready to get that promotion, why are you looking to leave?
**Jimparker8101977**: I don't know if I'm looking to leave.
**Jimparker8101977**: I just wanted to hear what y' all had to say and I want to see what you have.
**Jimparker8101977**: I'm, I'm interested.
**Jimparker8101977**: But again, it's.
**Jimparker8101977**: They've promoted some people that shouldn't have been promoted, in my opinion.
**Jimparker8101977**: And it's just frustrating if, you know, I might be stuck in this role as a PX for the rest of my life.
**Jimparker8101977**: I have no clue what they're really thinking.
**Jimparker8101977**: They don't tell me.
**Jimparker8101977**: They really do like me in operations doing operational work and focused on keeping Them safe and making money.
**Jimparker8101977**: Because that's what I do.
**Jimparker8101977**: I make money and I keep us out of trouble.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jimparker8101977**: But I really don't know what they.
**Jimparker8101977**: They're thinking for me, but in my opinion, I should be promoted.
**Bclymer**: Well, that's the only thing that matters.
**Bclymer**: I thought that for years.
**Jimparker8101977**: Yeah.
**Jimparker8101977**: Yeah.
**Jimparker8101977**: Well, Jesse, you got passed over more times than not times.
**Bclymer**: And I think anyone else I know.
**Bclymer**: I mean, I was a PM Two years ago, three years ago.
**Jimparker8101977**: Yeah.
**Jimparker8101977**: I just thought it was comical that you were working for Lance.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I mean, so as far as, like, you know, the best way to make money in construction or really any business is sales.
**Bclymer**: So, you know, as you.
**Bclymer**: If you're able to bring in work, you know, just like, you know, Jesse or anybody else, like, you know, that's when you.
**Bclymer**: You start to get the.
**Bclymer**: The rewards.
**Bclymer**: Right?
**Bclymer**: Because at the end of the day, if we don't sell anything, nobody, Nobody works.
**Bclymer**: So, you know, from my understanding, you know, just in what Jesse's told me, like, so if you can even get us indoors, right, Like, I, you know, again, I'm pretty good sales guy.
**Bclymer**: Like, I.
**Bclymer**: Pretty good client facing.
**Bclymer**: And so, like, a great asset for Jesse is that, you know, he has got a black book of people that, you know, he knows, like half of the.
**Bclymer**: Half the battle in sales is just getting the contact, right.
**Bclymer**: And so once we get in the door, then it works out really well.
**Bclymer**: So that's, you know, that's huge.
**Bclymer**: You know, if that's something you can do.
**Bclymer**: If you're saying you're, you know, you're doing all these, Winning all this work and, you know, selling all this work for Leighton, that's massive.
**Jimparker8101977**: Yeah, well, I have a Rolodex.
**Jimparker8101977**: I have a Rolodex of employees.
**Jimparker8101977**: I've got a Rolodex of subcontractors across the country.
**Jimparker8101977**: I can pick up the phone and 500 people will show up on top of you.
**Jimparker8101977**: It's.
**Jimparker8101977**: It's incredible.
**Jimparker8101977**: Like, so, you know, we did hurricane work last year.
**Jimparker8101977**: You know, I turned 90, $96 million in three months is what I turned on.
**Jimparker8101977**: One job.
**Jimparker8101977**: It was that Largo hospital that we.
**Jimparker8101977**: We basically gutted the CEP and rebuilt it along with other stuff.
**Jimparker8101977**: And, you know, it was because of my relationships and my name is.
**Jimparker8101977**: When we got that job and we made a shit pile of money and it was crazy.
**Bclymer**: That's huge.
**Bclymer**: See right there?
**Bclymer**: Right next door?
**Jimparker8101977**: Yeah.
**Jimparker8101977**: Margot Hospital.
**Jimparker8101977**: Yeah, I have those contacts.
**Jimparker8101977**: I also have them in Texas.
**Jimparker8101977**: I've got them everywhere.
**Jimparker8101977**: But it Just depends on what market and what niche you want to go to.
**Jimparker8101977**: And you know, what you've already got right now.
**Jimparker8101977**: You know the thing about these big box jobs, they never have their, their vendors for like Amazon and all the rest of them, they're so far behind and can't keep up and it's, it's miserable with their vendors and if we could become one of their vendors, I mean, we would just crush it.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I agree.
**Jimparker8101977**: So I don't know, it's just the sky's the limit as always.
**Jimparker8101977**: I mean there's a niche for everybody.
**Jimparker8101977**: I mean, Jesse's gonna go sell boat hitches or something.
**Bclymer**: That's right.
**Bclymer**: The loan launcher.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So, you know, so what my thought and like what I would do is because you live in.
**Bclymer**: Is it Greenville?
**Jimparker8101977**: Yeah, I live in Greenville, South Carolina.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And so obviously you work remote and you know, we've got a couple offices.
**Bclymer**: You know, eventually, you know, I'd love to because like Charlotte is close to you, right?
**Jimparker8101977**: It's about an hour 15 hour and 20.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So like I think opening up an office in Charlotte could be like a really good, good thing for us.
**Bclymer**: You know, right now we Indy Tampa and then my next one I wanted to look at was Nashville and then Houston, but I know Charlotte is growing a lot as well.
**Jimparker8101977**: Can I talk to you about Houston?
**Jimparker8101977**: So you know, I've got a $2.5 billion job in Houston.
**Jimparker8101977**: So it's three 36 story patient towers.
**Jimparker8101977**: Fucking huge.
**Jimparker8101977**: And then we got a seven story linear accelerator deal going on.
**Jimparker8101977**: We haven't started.
**Jimparker8101977**: We're still in pre con on it, but the market in Houston is saturated with GCS.
**Jimparker8101977**: We just turned in a proposal for a $20 million job and there was 12 other proposers.
**Jimparker8101977**: So it was.
**Jimparker8101977**: I don't know, I don't know if I'd want to go to Houston.
**Bclymer**: It's a well again, so it just that.
**Bclymer**: So when I initially started this, this was my growth plan was Indy, Tampa, Nashville, Houston, Atlanta over the course of 10 years.
**Bclymer**: But there's a reason for that.
**Bclymer**: So Tampa is because the entire west coast of Florida I think is going to be built out just like the east coast.
**Bclymer**: So that's primary Nashville.
**Bclymer**: It's because it's the healthier capital of the world.
**Bclymer**: So it's important to have those relationships with those guys.
**Bclymer**: Houston is because there's talks now it looks like it may have stalled, but at the time they were going to widen the locks in the Panama Canal.
**Bclymer**: And so then that means that instead of Sitting off the coast of LA for 60 days.
**Bclymer**: Cargo ships would go through the canal for two weeks and offload in Houston.
**Bclymer**: So the warehouse boom would be out of this world in Houston.
**Bclymer**: Cheaper ground, easier to build, no taxes.
**Bclymer**: So that, that was the attraction there.
**Bclymer**: And then Atlanta, just in general is a growing area.
**Bclymer**: It's really, you know, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina.
**Bclymer**: Those three states are rapid growth.
**Bclymer**: So yeah, so it's, you know, Houston was a far reach.
**Bclymer**: There's no.
**Bclymer**: Again, things change.
**Jimparker8101977**: I mean, you've got a great idea and it's just, I mean, it's a great idea.
**Jimparker8101977**: I mean, you got it.
**Jimparker8101977**: You definitely have a good theory on everything.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jimparker8101977**: There's another niche that's going on is the data center world.
**Jimparker8101977**: I mean, it is freaking sick.
**Bclymer**: Absolutely.
**Jimparker8101977**: We have won, I think $6 billion worth of data center work.
**Jimparker8101977**: And our org chart.
**Jimparker8101977**: There's this gentleman named tbd.
**Jimparker8101977**: He is like the star of every org chart we have in the data center world.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, he's a real go getter.
**Jimparker8101977**: He is.
**Jimparker8101977**: And the problem with him is that means that we're understaffed and we don't have manpower to staff these jobs.
**Jimparker8101977**: And the problem is you're going to staff with a bunch of bozo the fucking clowns to do this work and then it's going to be trade partners that we could be or you could be that just come out of the blue just to save their ass.
**Jimparker8101977**: That just freaking soak it with money.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
**Bclymer**: There's definitely a lot of opportunity in different facets, for sure.
**Bclymer**: So, you know, one thing like you talk about, like, you know, attracting all these, you know, people, project managers, whatnot would they, like, I don't know, like, are they out of Nashville?
**Bclymer**: Like, what office do these guys work out of?
**Jimparker8101977**: So I've got buddies in Florida.
**Jimparker8101977**: I've got them in Arizona, I've got them Nashville, Birmingham, Texas.
**Jimparker8101977**: I've got them all over the country.
**Jimparker8101977**: Just depends on what you want to do or where you want to go.
**Bclymer**: Are they, are they on jobs or remote or do you have offices?
**Jimparker8101977**: So.
**Jimparker8101977**: So I've got a couple of estimators.
**Jimparker8101977**: So my estimators.
**Jimparker8101977**: And he's in South Florida and then I've got one in Birmingham.
**Jimparker8101977**: And then there's a senior PM that I have in Phoenix.
**Jimparker8101977**: He's the one that was talking about the multifamily work on top of Costco's, which was, it's out west.
**Jimparker8101977**: I.
**Jimparker8101977**: That was.
**Jimparker8101977**: Blew my mind that that was even a idea that.
**Jimparker8101977**: But in Atlanta, there's A Costco that's the center tenant of a multi family like deal.
**Jimparker8101977**: Like there's tons of apartments around a Costco, which was just crazy.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And so I guess as far as like, you know, project managers, you know, I guess what I'm asking is like, are they all working remote or on jobs or like do you guys have people work out offices?
**Jimparker8101977**: So depends on what the job is and how large it is.
**Jimparker8101977**: So my $160 million job that I want in Savannah, project management will be on site.
**Jimparker8101977**: My one in Houston, all the project managers will be on site.
**Jimparker8101977**: My one, I've got a $60 million job going on in Dallas, project manager on site.
**Jimparker8101977**: I've got an 80 and a $35 million job going also in Houston.
**Jimparker8101977**: But my project manager is remote.
**Jimparker8101977**: They're actually working out of the office in Houston.
**Jimparker8101977**: And it just depends on the project, the project size and what the requirement is of the job.
**Jimparker8101977**: Like we gonna be moving fast, we're gonna be moving slow.
**Jimparker8101977**: You know, is this a quick burn?
**Jimparker8101977**: Is it a three month or a two month job?
**Jimparker8101977**: I mean, it just depends on what's going on.
**Bclymer**: So because my, my theory and what I like to see, I think that having, you know, especially when you talk about project managers, APMs, all that kind of stuff like, you know, being in the office or if a job site.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: But if, let's say that, you know, we don't have, we don't have a bunch of $120 million jobs, so we don't have, you know, a six trailer office.
**Bclymer**: And so right now like having those people in the office I think is hugely valuable just through osmosis.
**Bclymer**: So they can they hear us talk, they pick up on what's going on.
**Bclymer**: We can hear them and coach them and train them and help them.
**Bclymer**: So any of these, you know, PMS or lower guys that, you know, if you would attract or talk to them, do you think that they would relocate to either India or Tampa area to work out of one of those offices or these guys, all, you know, wherever they live is where they stay.
**Jimparker8101977**: I'm not exactly sure.
**Jimparker8101977**: I mean, it's just depends on, you know, you know, money talks and all that stuff.
**Jimparker8101977**: I have no clue what they would do.
**Jimparker8101977**: I haven't approached any of them.
**Jimparker8101977**: But I know Jesse was talking about a job in Phoenix coming up and you know, that senior PM would definitely be there for Phoenix to be on site.
**Jimparker8101977**: It was a volleyball.
**Bclymer**: Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: I don't know what's going on with that project, but I Mean, Yeah, that wouldn't.
**Bclymer**: If it kicks.
**Bclymer**: I mean, they're still arguing.
**Bclymer**: So we got the.
**Bclymer**: The Phoenix or the.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I think.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah, that one today.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jimparker8101977**: But Brandon, you have a great point is, you know, the culture in the office is important for sure.
**Jimparker8101977**: And, you know, if everybody's in the office, everything works well.
**Jimparker8101977**: But in construction, those offices are great, but lots and lots of people are either traveling to the job site or on the job site or for this meeting.
**Jimparker8101977**: And that meeting and office space is kind of a.
**Jimparker8101977**: It just depends on the day to day for who's there in the office.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: I mean, obviously, if.
**Bclymer**: When I say office, like if you've got a big project and you have an office on the job site, then that's the same thing.
**Bclymer**: When I.
**Bclymer**: You know, just people working, you know, especially when you're growing in your career, I think working at home is more of a detriment than being around people who are.
**Bclymer**: We.
**Jimparker8101977**: We're not a fan of the remote working at all.
**Jimparker8101977**: At Leighton, like, I'm the only one in the company who has even like negotiated that shit everybody else has demanded.
**Jimparker8101977**: Be that on the site or at one of our offices.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: How many.
**Bclymer**: How many offices does Leighton have?
**Bclymer**: I know you have the Nashville one, but we have.
**Jimparker8101977**: We're opening one up in Tampa right now.
**Jimparker8101977**: We've got one in Nashville, we've got one in Boise, we have one in Salt lake, we've got three in Hawaii.
**Jimparker8101977**: I mean, three in California, two in Hawaii.
**Jimparker8101977**: And then we're part of 19 other general contractors in a big, huge group.
**Jimparker8101977**: We have four in Texas, Houston, San Antonio, Austin and Dallas.
**Jimparker8101977**: It's a.
**Jimparker8101977**: We do about.
**Jimparker8101977**: Last year we did 4.4 billion as Layton as our.
**Jimparker8101977**: The company that we're a part of, we did 11.3 billion.
**Bclymer**: What do you mean the company you're part of, like Layton's own by somebody else?
**Jimparker8101977**: Yeah, we're part of this company called STO Building Group, which puts us around like number six on the scale of GCS in the country or in the world.
**Bclymer**: So STO is just a private equity firm that bought up a bunch of GCS and did a conglomerate.
**Jimparker8101977**: That's it.
**Jimparker8101977**: That's it.
**Jimparker8101977**: That's it.
**Jimparker8101977**: Nobody actually works for STO that does anything, in my opinion.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, no, it's just a roll up and then they, you know, leverage it.
**Bclymer**: Sidney PE always does.
**Jimparker8101977**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Great.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, so what, I guess, kind of, what questions do you have, you know, for me or what?
**Bclymer**: Can I guess?
**Bclymer**: What are your thoughts?
**Jimparker8101977**: I Just wonder like, I mean, what's the timing and what's the realness of the job in Savannah and the one in Coral Gables and all that stuff?
**Bclymer**: Cape Coral.
**Bclymer**: Okay, Coral.
**Jimparker8101977**: Cape Coral.
**Jimparker8101977**: Sorry.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, the Paradise Isles.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So, I mean, the, the Port Wentworth, you know, Savannah, it's.
**Bclymer**: Port Wentworth is where it actually is, is.
**Bclymer**: I mean, literally they texted me today, said we'll either get the OI today or actually here it is.
**Jimparker8101977**: Oh, shit.
**Bclymer**: He just, he just texted me right now and says, yeah, he goes, the city's scared that we're going to pull out.
**Bclymer**: Like they promised they're going to get us the LOI Monday at the latest.
**Bclymer**: So, yeah, that, that's, I mean, I'm 95 sure that's gonna hit.
**Bclymer**: Obviously, there's always a chance.
**Bclymer**: But yeah, Paradise Isles.
**Bclymer**: I have a meeting on Monday with that group.
**Bclymer**: See how that goes.
**Bclymer**: I think it'll go well.
**Bclymer**: I mean, they, they, we've had very good interest in that one, but that wouldn't, I mean, we wouldn't break ground for a year, maybe two, something like that.
**Bclymer**: I don't know how, how long the design would take.
**Jimparker8101977**: Maybe a year and a half for Paradise Isles.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jimparker8101977**: Okay.
**Jimparker8101977**: And then Savannah would start, what, next year?
**Jimparker8101977**: Probably mid year or something.
**Bclymer**: I mean, they, they sooner the better.
**Bclymer**: They want to see the stuff.
**Bclymer**: I mean, like, as soon as we can get design and stuff done.
**Bclymer**: I mean, my goal would be to be able to be here for permit in four months.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So, you know, that would, I would expect that one to start, you know, ideally tail end of this year.
**Jimparker8101977**: Well, yeah, so we have a beach house in Buford which is an hour from Savannah.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: I built, I built a Compass health rehab hospital there.
**Jimparker8101977**: Is that the one that fell down?
**Bclymer**: No, no, that was the one that it burnt down because there's a electrical short.
**Bclymer**: Really?
**Jimparker8101977**: No.
**Bclymer**: They forgot to put a roof on Jim, and somehow it just kept leaking.
**Bclymer**: So I abandoned the site.
**Jimparker8101977**: You know that Jesse did one earnest help that had asbestos in the planters.
**Jimparker8101977**: So.
**Jimparker8101977**: Just saying, you get cancer just for being on site if there's a breeze blowing.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: So those, those, those projects again, like, again, I definitely, you know, Savannah, I have full confidence in.
**Bclymer**: And again, I, I, I can tell you this much.
**Bclymer**: I am like, when I first, like when they first approached us about Paradise Isles, I gave it like a 10% chance.
**Bclymer**: I was like, there's no way.
**Bclymer**: Blah, blah, blah, like now it's like, okay, wow, this is like, you know, like 80, like it's really actually Going through, which just, it's great.
**Bclymer**: It's just, it's hard to believe, right?
**Bclymer**: Like, you know, three, three and a half years in to be looking at, you know, a billion dollars in work.
**Bclymer**: Like.
**Jimparker8101977**: Yeah, but.
**Jimparker8101977**: And it's also scary, too, because you're like, how am I gonna pull this off?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I mean, you know, I always, I have a saying, you know, find a way to make it happen.
**Bclymer**: And so I always, you know, that's, you know, we'll find a way to make it happen.
**Bclymer**: Like, period.
**Bclymer**: Like, it doesn't scare me.
**Jimparker8101977**: Dope.
**Jimparker8101977**: Well, yeah, definitely interested and see what happens in the future and see what y' all think, where I would fit.
**Bclymer**: So, I mean, yeah, like, even I said right now, I mean, we're, we're actively looking, and I think Jesse and I are both aligned.
**Bclymer**: Like, we would love to bring you over.
**Bclymer**: You know, I, I guess I, Maybe I misunderstood or I was under the impression that you were, you were interested in coming over and this was more.
**Jimparker8101977**: Oh, no, I'm.
**Jimparker8101977**: I'm interested in coming over, but, dude, it's a huge jump.
**Jimparker8101977**: It's a risk out this world.
**Jimparker8101977**: I have, you know, I have the golden ticket.
**Jimparker8101977**: Nine years now.
**Jimparker8101977**: So.
**Jimparker8101977**: I worked for MJ for about 16 years.
**Jimparker8101977**: And I worked for Layton for nine.
**Jimparker8101977**: About to be 10 here soon.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I mean, I, I, I totally understand and, and agree with you wholeheartedly.
**Bclymer**: Like, you know, it is a, it is a risk.
**Bclymer**: And the safe play is to stay at Leighton.
**Jimparker8101977**: I know.
**Jimparker8101977**: To be freaking pigeonholed for the rest of my life, potentially.
**Jimparker8101977**: Or not.
**Jimparker8101977**: Who knows?
**Bclymer**: I mean, the good news is, at your age, it can't be that much longer.
**Bclymer**: You should hear the stuff I get.
**Bclymer**: Wow.
**Jimparker8101977**: Wow.
**Jimparker8101977**: Jesse.
**Jimparker8101977**: You know, Jesse and I share the same birthday, too, so at least you could.
**Bclymer**: You only like, eight, you know, what, 1843, like.
**Bclymer**: Oh, you meant the day.
**Bclymer**: Oh, I thought the year.
**Bclymer**: Jim, this is how much I, I want you to join us.
**Bclymer**: I will give up until you get to your 600, 000, you can have any bonus idea because you get to that plateau.
**Jimparker8101977**: I mean, it's a pipe dream, as always, but it's a, you know, who knows?
**Jimparker8101977**: I mean, I'm very interested in continuing the conversation.
**Jimparker8101977**: I'm very interested in helping you.
**Jimparker8101977**: I really want to know where I would fit in your role, to see what I could do.
**Bclymer**: I mean, so here's the thing.
**Bclymer**: I can tell you this.
**Bclymer**: Like, $600,000 a year, like, I look at that and I.
**Bclymer**: That's very attainable.
**Bclymer**: Like, I Believe that.
**Bclymer**: Like so the way that, that, you know, we compensate, if you bring it work, you, you get a piece of what that work makes like the commission on that.
**Bclymer**: So you know, after salary and bonuses, like again, like you're not going to make $600,000 salary day one.
**Bclymer**: But you know, when you, when you, when you bring in stuff like, like I, I firmly like part of the reason this company exists is because of my last firm.
**Bclymer**: I was a VP and my last year there I brought in like 20 million, you know, with a net profit of like a little over two.
**Bclymer**: And my bonus was, I don't know, 35, 40 grand, you know, like ridiculous.
**Jimparker8101977**: Like, yeah, it's the same thing with me.
**Jimparker8101977**: You know, I did that 96 million dollar job, right.
**Jimparker8101977**: My bonus on that was 15k just for that job.
**Jimparker8101977**: And then I brought in like 450 million here in the last couple of months and I'll see just my standard 40k bonus, you know, so my standard bonus is like 40k and then I get another one if I really go out of the way.
**Jimparker8101977**: So, so we do, we do.
**Bclymer**: If you know, somebody, you know, brings in work or whatever in the company, then they get 10 of the profit of the job.
**Jimparker8101977**: Cool.
**Jimparker8101977**: So did Jesse bring in the billion dollar job?
**Bclymer**: No, I didn't.
**Jimparker8101977**: Damn.
**Jimparker8101977**: That's Jesse right there.
**Bclymer**: But he did get the, the Aspire stuff.
**Bclymer**: That'll be, you know, that'll be some good commission.
**Bclymer**: Plus Jesse's a partner in the firm, so.
**Jimparker8101977**: So what is his percentage of the firm?
**Jimparker8101977**: Is he like a 5% shareholder or what's the.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yep, 5.
**Jimparker8101977**: And who owns the rust?
**Bclymer**: I do.
**Jimparker8101977**: Who is Brandon?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jimparker8101977**: So I take it Jesse doesn't have much authority to bump you if, for that 5% or does he?
**Bclymer**: What do you mean to bump me?
**Jimparker8101977**: Like if y' all disagree on how to do business, like if there's a disagreement.
**Bclymer**: What I mean, so it's pretty easy.
**Bclymer**: I mean, yeah, I guess not.
**Jimparker8101977**: But I mean just the one day it happens.
**Jimparker8101977**: Like, you say you should paint the wall green and Jesse says brown and you know.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I mean if, if that's the case then, then yeah, I mean obviously we would, it would be green.
**Bclymer**: But like really the thing is, so Jesse handles, you know, ops, like, you know, that's, you know, so I, you know, I, I, I get with him.
**Bclymer**: What do you want to do?
**Bclymer**: How do you do it?
**Bclymer**: Like, and he's right.
**Bclymer**: I mean, we do think alike.
**Bclymer**: Like we're very much on the same page about what things should be Done.
**Bclymer**: And, you know, I defer to him on.
**Bclymer**: On most decisions, especially when it comes to what should be done in the field, who should do what, how it should be ran.
**Bclymer**: Like, at the end of the day, he has, you know, more construction knowledge than I do, you know, and vice versa, you know, as far as sales, customer acquisition, like, relations, you know, he.
**Bclymer**: He defers to me.
**Bclymer**: Like, I'm good at that.
**Bclymer**: Like, that's.
**Bclymer**: That's.
**Bclymer**: We each have our strengths.
**Jimparker8101977**: So y' all know each other's strengths and weaknesses and y' all understand.
**Jimparker8101977**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I mean, that's.
**Jimparker8101977**: Sorry to ask the weird question of like that, but I was just wondering.
**Bclymer**: I mean, no, it's like some people, because I don't give a.
**Bclymer**: About colors or my desks or my chair or my truck or, like, I don't care about any of those things.
**Bclymer**: I just like things being built correctly and people making the right decisions when they're in charge of a job site.
**Bclymer**: That's all I care about, you know, And I don't.
**Bclymer**: I don't want to get.
**Bclymer**: You know, it's a relief to me when you have people that can just handle things and you don't have to babysit them.
**Bclymer**: I don't want to babysit.
**Bclymer**: I don't want to over watch and analyze what everyone does because that's.
**Bclymer**: I don't like doing that, you know.
**Jimparker8101977**: Well, the whole.
**Jimparker8101977**: Yeah.
**Jimparker8101977**: You hire somebody for a role, they should do their job.
**Jimparker8101977**: You didn't hire them for not that role.
**Jimparker8101977**: Like, you hired a superintendent to build a job.
**Jimparker8101977**: Build job.
**Jimparker8101977**: You hired a project manager to do the paperwork and make sure you get paid and billing and everything else.
**Jimparker8101977**: They should be able to do that.
**Jimparker8101977**: And if they can't see it, you know, it's easy and.
**Jimparker8101977**: Sounds like y' all have got yalls roles picked out between the two, y' all.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I'd say that.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So, Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I mean, you know, that's.
**Bclymer**: That's kind of the.
**Bclymer**: The role that we would see and that we would.
**Bclymer**: We would like you to fill, if you're interested.
**Jimparker8101977**: Is the operations side, too and halfway selling.
**Jimparker8101977**: If I could figure out some sales.
**Bclymer**: Ask the question again.
**Jimparker8101977**: Running operations.
**Jimparker8101977**: Running operations.
**Jimparker8101977**: Okay, perfect.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: But I mean, by all means, like, again, I didn't realize.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jimparker8101977**: Or.
**Bclymer**: Or really, again, it's like.
**Bclymer**: Like with Jesse, like, it's the introduction, you know, and then.
**Bclymer**: And then, you know, it's.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I could, you know, go to, you know, obviously go to the meetings, do that stuff.
**Bclymer**: Like, that's.
**Bclymer**: I don't expect people, I mean it's great but I don't expect people to 100 go in and you know, here you go and like the, you know, job is sold and they ran everything like you know, I like to give Brandon here's my contact, I introduce them, get to know him and then I let Brandon do all the sales stuff because that's not my, my, that's not my thing.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Jimparker8101977**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Was is that.
**Bclymer**: I guess are you.
**Jimparker8101977**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: That more interested in, in this, in the sales than the ops?
**Jimparker8101977**: Hell hell no.
**Jimparker8101977**: I'm more interested in operations I don't have.
**Jimparker8101977**: I mean I go to interviews and presentations all the time.
**Jimparker8101977**: I mean they're wonderful.
**Jimparker8101977**: I love doing that.
**Jimparker8101977**: But.
**Jimparker8101977**: And scheming how to put together an RFP and all that stuff.
**Jimparker8101977**: I love doing it and I love working the numbers to make sure that we win and you know, all that stuff.
**Jimparker8101977**: I think it's great because at the end of the day if you don't sell the work and if you don't, you know, scheme out the, the proposals properly, you're not going to get the contract.
**Jimparker8101977**: And if you don't get the contract, you're not going to make the money.
**Jimparker8101977**: And that's a, a lot of people don't understand that like you got to get the contract to make the money, otherwise you're just practicing.
**Jimparker8101977**: And I'm not too old to practice.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, certainly.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: We don't do, I mean really many RFPs or anything like that.
**Bclymer**: I mean all of our stuff is typically just negotiation.
**Jimparker8101977**: Yeah.
**Jimparker8101977**: We consider an RFP presentation, proposal, pursuit situation, negotiated work too.
**Jimparker8101977**: But because you know, you're not hard bidding it, you're still half ass negotiating it.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah, I get that.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: What other I guess questions or thoughts do you have?
**Jimparker8101977**: I don't know, I just wonder what the timing is that y' all are looking for this role and what start in two weeks and what you would expect my day to day to be if I did go this way.
**Bclymer**: I'll let you answer that.
**Jimparker8101977**: I mean that's.
**Bclymer**: I try to talk to all the guys if I can.
**Bclymer**: I don't get through all of them.
**Bclymer**: Every day I have we call it a PSR like a monthly report that the PMs all do on our jobs.
**Bclymer**: You know, just make sure they get those in each month.
**Bclymer**: They get all their billings in each month.
**Bclymer**: You know, I help, you know, because our PMs work with the estimator, you know, we're putting together budget numbers so I get involved in that, you know, These are all things that I'm doing that I'm looking for, you like to help me out with and then eventually just take it over.
**Jimparker8101977**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And that's good.
**Jimparker8101977**: Yeah.
**Jimparker8101977**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, it's just running everything from, you know, estimate the estimating team through jobs closed out, talking with the guys, making sure they're getting things done and then answering their questions.
**Jimparker8101977**: You know, they all.
**Bclymer**: You get a few phone calls a day from the guys, you know, are just unsure about things.
**Bclymer**: So I think you're probably a better teacher than me.
**Bclymer**: It's not my strong point either, but.
**Jimparker8101977**: Okay, so basically what I do already, right?
**Bclymer**: Just keep doing what you're doing.
**Bclymer**: Except.
**Bclymer**: Except none of that HR that you're talking about.
**Bclymer**: No hr.
**Jimparker8101977**: All right, I know, I know.
**Jimparker8101977**: You know, Warm and fuzzy over there.
**Jimparker8101977**: Love you.
**Jimparker8101977**: Love you.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Here's what's funny is we got this client, Uniqlo, and they sent us the contract and it's the, it's like, you know, they could come on the site and one of their employees could hit one of our people over the head and we'd still be at fault.
**Bclymer**: That type of.
**Bclymer**: So Brandon marks it up, sent it back to them.
**Bclymer**: They're like, well, no, no, we have to have a meeting.
**Bclymer**: We're going to get our attorney.
**Bclymer**: They're like, okay.
**Bclymer**: And so we show up and they're like, well, where's your attorney?
**Bclymer**: We're like, we don't have one.
**Bclymer**: We don't, like, we don't need one.
**Bclymer**: We don't have any use for one.
**Bclymer**: And their, their attorney's like, well, I'm not, I can't talk unless I speak to your council.
**Bclymer**: We're like, we are our own council.
**Bclymer**: So just say what you got to say.
**Bclymer**: We'll tell you what, what we agree to or don't agree to.
**Bclymer**: And they just can't get that.
**Bclymer**: They don't understand it.
**Bclymer**: Every time I would say something, the attorney would be like, are you guys okay with that?
**Bclymer**: I was like, why would I pay somebody a thousand dollars an hour to do that when they're just going to turn around and ask me?
**Jimparker8101977**: Yeah, I've had, I've got attorney or general counsel for all laytons playing phone tag with me right now today for a question that I should be able to answer myself.
**Jimparker8101977**: But I've got to verify that general counsel agrees with my.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah, no, thank you.
**Bclymer**: No.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, well, so, yeah, as far as the day to day role, you know, that's kind of.
**Bclymer**: And as far as when, you know, when we're looking to, you know, fill this position is, you know, I'd say right away.
**Bclymer**: I mean, again, we're, you know, wanting to, to pull the trigger and get moving.
**Bclymer**: I.
**Bclymer**: It's, you know, we have, like Jesse said, we do have a lot of stuff like that's either hitting or already hit and it just, it doesn't stop.
**Bclymer**: Like, I mean, what do we land?
**Bclymer**: 20 million this week?
**Bclymer**: Like, you know.
**Jimparker8101977**: Okay, yeah, well, all right.
**Jimparker8101977**: Just, I guess, I mean, the role sounds.
**Jimparker8101977**: I can do that role all day, so that's not a challenge for me.
**Bclymer**: So what are your thoughts?
**Bclymer**: I guess.
**Bclymer**: What, what is your, like, you know, is this like, when would you want to leave or do you want to wait and see if you get promoted?
**Bclymer**: Like.
**Jimparker8101977**: I mean, I have no clue that it'll ever happen.
**Jimparker8101977**: I don't really.
**Jimparker8101977**: I mean, right now I'm running so much work, it makes my head spin.
**Jimparker8101977**: And, you know, I just say, because.
**Bclymer**: You know, the second you turn your resignation, and then they'll offer you that or they'll promise it to you, like in six months.
**Jimparker8101977**: I don't believe they will.
**Jimparker8101977**: I have no clue what they'll do.
**Jimparker8101977**: I don't really care.
**Jimparker8101977**: I just, you know, I'm just always scared about longevity because, you know, my next move is like, whenever I left mj, I thought the move from MJ to Layton was my, you know, into my career.
**Jimparker8101977**: I was going to work there forever.
**Jimparker8101977**: And yeah, I don't know what's going to go on.
**Jimparker8101977**: So that's what I'm looking for is, you know, I'm not looking for a fucking job or I got a job.
**Jimparker8101977**: I'm looking for a career and a path for success and, you know, basically to push me toward retirement, you know, eventually.
**Bclymer**: I mean, I can tell you this, like, I understand the, obviously the safety and security aspect of it, you know, going From a, whatever 11 billion dollar year revenue company to, you know, much smaller firm.
**Bclymer**: And I can't, I can't really say anything to qualm your fears on that.
**Bclymer**: The only thing I will say, and this is the same kind of thing that I told Jesse when he had the same reservations about coming over, is that if things get worse to worse, right?
**Bclymer**: Like all of a sudden the economy goes down, blah, blah, blah, and we got to stop, okay?
**Bclymer**: We're chipping people away, whatever.
**Bclymer**: Like it might get down to just me and him, you know, or me, him and you, or whatever.
**Bclymer**: And I am supremely confident that if, hell, if it was just the three of us and we do $4 million a year in work, you know, at a 1020 margin, something like that.
**Bclymer**: Like, we'll find a way to stay afloat and make the money and keep growing like I am.
**Bclymer**: I have zero worries about us ever not making it.
**Bclymer**: Like, if something happens, it may get lean, but we'll, we'll get through it.
**Jimparker8101977**: Yeah, I just, you know, it's just the scare factor.
**Jimparker8101977**: Totally the only thing I got.
**Bclymer**: Totally.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Because, I mean, I, I, I have, Trust me.
**Bclymer**: You know, when I look at our payroll, you know, that scares me because I'm like, man, all these people depend on me.
**Bclymer**: Like, I gotta get it, I gotta deliver, you know, So I, I totally get it.
**Jimparker8101977**: All right.
**Jimparker8101977**: Well, yeah, so I guess.
**Bclymer**: So let's, I guess we'll send you an offer letter.
**Jimparker8101977**: Sorry, my earbud finally died.
**Jimparker8101977**: So what do y' all think?
**Jimparker8101977**: When.
**Jimparker8101977**: What would the offer look like?
**Bclymer**: Or.
**Jimparker8101977**: All that.
**Bclymer**: You there?
**Jimparker8101977**: Yeah, I'm here.
**Jimparker8101977**: What would the office look like?
**Jimparker8101977**: I mean, do y' all need to sit back and think and put something together?
**Bclymer**: And you said your salary was 200?
**Jimparker8101977**: Yeah, my base is 200.
**Jimparker8101977**: I get a 60 a year bonus, then a truck, 401k insurance, all that crap.
**Jimparker8101977**: And then I have like $40,000 worth of company stock right now also that I would leave behind.
**Bclymer**: It's not vested after nine years.
**Jimparker8101977**: No.
**Jimparker8101977**: So what happens is our stock vest every three years, and I've pulled out everything that I've.
**Jimparker8101977**: That is not vested on already.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jimparker8101977**: Smart.
**Bclymer**: Is it latent national or publicly traded?
**Jimparker8101977**: No, they're not.
**Jimparker8101977**: So.
**Bclymer**: Oh, so you can just cash it out and they'll give you cash for it?
**Jimparker8101977**: Yeah.
**Jimparker8101977**: So I got, we got bought in 19, and I had like 6,500 shares of Layton at that time.
**Jimparker8101977**: They gave me about $400,000 for like 60% of that stock in cash, and the rest vested in, you know, three years.
**Jimparker8101977**: And those three years has been up.
**Jimparker8101977**: I pulled that out.
**Jimparker8101977**: And then they give me a couple of bonuses that have RSUs in them, which I can't pull out until they best.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I mean, I wouldn't go anywhere I'd hold on to that 40,000 if I were you.
**Jimparker8101977**: 40,000 is not enough.
**Jimparker8101977**: That's chump change, I think is what we're talking about.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: I mean, I, as far as offer goes, I, I, Whatever you think.
**Bclymer**: I thought you already, I thought you guys already had an offer.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, like if he'd agree to come.
**Jimparker8101977**: Aboard for that.
**Bclymer**: Plus, you know, the opportunity to get the, you know, the other bonuses on commissions and like how we do.
**Bclymer**: That's the other thing.
**Bclymer**: Like you're going to be the third in line person at this company.
**Bclymer**: So you know all those, you know, performance and metrics that I don't know, I mean, do.
**Jimparker8101977**: Well.
**Bclymer**: What was after your.
**Bclymer**: Is it was a.
**Bclymer**: After your first month or second month.
**Bclymer**: Three months.
**Bclymer**: After three months you had like 55 or 60,000 in bonuses or something like that?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, 50 grand.
**Bclymer**: 60 grand last year, something like that.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: For three months.
**Jimparker8101977**: For what reason?
**Jimparker8101977**: Just job completion or what's the just value?
**Bclymer**: You know, like the, the big one was, you know, just at the end, you know, just a piece of how good we did, you know, I can't remember.
**Bclymer**: I can't remember off top of my head.
**Bclymer**: I think one of them was, you know, a part of a job bonus.
**Bclymer**: I think 10 grand or something like that.
**Bclymer**: Another one was just after your first month, just the, the value, like here's another ten grand or something like that.
**Bclymer**: I.
**Bclymer**: I don't recall exactly what they all refer to.
**Bclymer**: One was for the.
**Bclymer**: I got my NASCALA test.
**Bclymer**: That was this year.
**Bclymer**: That was this year, though.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, he passed his nasca.
**Bclymer**: And so we were, we had a company meeting and we had this, we had this project engineer that's been doing really well and just was coming in and like, really overworking.
**Bclymer**: We wanted to highlight that.
**Bclymer**: And so I was like, oh.
**Bclymer**: I was like, why don't I.
**Bclymer**: I was like, I was like, I'll just get a thousand dollars cash, you know, and I'll get in there and like did the meeting and like, you know, give it to him right there, you know, and so, you know, you know, hey, you know, Andrew, whatever, you give it to him.
**Bclymer**: And I was like, oh, we got another one.
**Bclymer**: And then I set down $10,000 cash in front of Jesse for passing the test.
**Jimparker8101977**: Nice.
**Bclymer**: And then he had to fly back with it.
**Bclymer**: Oh my God.
**Bclymer**: I'm putting it in the bank in 800 increments to keep from getting flagged.
**Jimparker8101977**: That's funny.
**Bclymer**: But then that project engineer, he called in sick that day.
**Bclymer**: Oh yeah, Andrew.
**Jimparker8101977**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Never calls in the one day.
**Bclymer**: Good kid, though.
**Jimparker8101977**: That's funny.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So you tell us, what do you need?
**Jimparker8101977**: I don't.
**Jimparker8101977**: Yeah, I don't know what I need.
**Jimparker8101977**: I just don't know.
**Jimparker8101977**: I just, I don't know.
**Jimparker8101977**: I'm still trying to figure out what I want to do when I grow up.
**Bclymer**: I know you don't know, but if you did know, what would you say?
**Jimparker8101977**: Yeah, I would think the base of like 260 and then bonuses after that.
**Jimparker8101977**: So, you know, because bonuses are always based upon feelings and all this other bullshit.
**Jimparker8101977**: Yeah, Latent.
**Jimparker8101977**: They're based on if you're in the boys club or not.
**Bclymer**: Well, like mj, when I think did that poplar block job made him almost $7 million.
**Jimparker8101977**: Well, they had sent us based on feelings too.
**Bclymer**: Well, they set aside.
**Bclymer**: It was in my budget.
**Bclymer**: That was $700,000 for bonuses.
**Bclymer**: I got 20 grand.
**Jimparker8101977**: So I wasn't even on that job.
**Jimparker8101977**: And I got 20 grand that year too.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, exactly.
**Bclymer**: You're welcome.
**Bclymer**: But some of the field engineers, they were there working the whole time, day and night.
**Bclymer**: Some one of them got like 1500 bucks.
**Jimparker8101977**: I was like, what the.
**Jimparker8101977**: But that was the first bonus that MJ had paid out in three years too.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, damn.
**Jimparker8101977**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: That was a tough time, man.
**Bclymer**: I couldn't get a job.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So, I mean, I guess it sounds like what I'm hearing at least.
**Bclymer**: You know, 260 is pretty much.
**Bclymer**: That's what you make right now, correct?
**Jimparker8101977**: That's what I make with bonuses right now.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: And so you want to essentially guarantee salary of 260.
**Bclymer**: You know, that way you're matching what you could potentially make it.
**Bclymer**: Leighton.
**Jimparker8101977**: Yes.
**Jimparker8101977**: What I would make it Layton.
**Jimparker8101977**: Plus, you know, hopefully I would be compensated on top of that with bonuses.
**Bclymer**: Is 260 guaranteed at Leighton?
**Jimparker8101977**: Only 200 is guaranteed.
**Jimparker8101977**: The 60 is performance based or feeling based or whatever the hell you want to call it.
**Bclymer**: And so they gave you a $60,000 bonus last year?
**Jimparker8101977**: Correct.
**Bclymer**: Gotcha.
**Bclymer**: And is that every year you've gotten that or is that just last year?
**Jimparker8101977**: So the year before I got a $46,000 bonus.
**Jimparker8101977**: And it's just, you know, just depends on feelings and all this other shit and how the company did as a whole and if we all, you know, all that crap.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah, I mean, I get that.
**Bclymer**: You know, I remember, you know, working at again other companies and it was all based on feelings, you know, that's part of the reason I left because I wanted to get rewarded based off merit.
**Bclymer**: That's.
**Bclymer**: I mean, Jesse, I are both the same way.
**Bclymer**: We hated that about like Dangerous diamond is that we'd be sitting there kicking ass and not getting rewarded for it.
**Jimparker8101977**: So I understand that cheerleader, that was your balls.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, they.
**Bclymer**: Convicted swindler.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I think.
**Bclymer**: What's his name?
**Bclymer**: Jason Zane.
**Bclymer**: Jason Zane.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I don't know.
**Bclymer**: I mean, you know, 260 is a tall order.
**Bclymer**: Would that be like 200 salary and then just guaranteed 60 at the end of the year.
**Bclymer**: Standard bonus, plus whatever you get.
**Jimparker8101977**: Well, I would.
**Jimparker8101977**: What I would want is I would want my base to be 260, and then I would want bonuses on top of that.
**Jimparker8101977**: But y' all talk it over, whatever y' all want to do.
**Jimparker8101977**: You know, I have no clue what is going on.
**Jimparker8101977**: And I just, you know, I for sure could help with Yalls jobs right now.
**Jimparker8101977**: Savannah for sure.
**Jimparker8101977**: That's right there near my house and everything else.
**Jimparker8101977**: And easily staffed.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I mean, yeah, I mean, definitely for.
**Bclymer**: For 260, you know, 300,000.
**Bclymer**: 350.
**Bclymer**: There's a lot of guys that come in there around that.
**Jimparker8101977**: Yeah, well, yeah, exactly, Mike.
**Jimparker8101977**: That's fine.
**Bclymer**: Y' all, my thought, you know, is, you know, like, you know, just like, you know, Jesse, there has to be a little, little buy in, you know, because again, like when you're building something, right, like, sure, you can go out and you can pay for talent and overpay and get bodies and whatnot.
**Bclymer**: But what I want to create and what we want to create is a culture of like, hey, I'm in this.
**Bclymer**: Like, we're in this together.
**Bclymer**: You know, that's why I like to.
**Bclymer**: Again, like, I can see where you've been and been passed over and not gotten the promotions, not gotten the raises.
**Bclymer**: You know, that might, you know, be a fear in your head.
**Bclymer**: And I don't really know what I can do to ease that.
**Bclymer**: Besides, obviously, you know, you know Jesse, and trust Jesse, from my understanding, and he can tell you how it's been in just a year here.
**Bclymer**: But that would be my thing, is that, you know, my understanding of Jesse was like, okay, he wants, you know, to match his base and, and be able to make more than what he's making now.
**Bclymer**: And I was like, yeah, I mean, I don't see any reason why he can't, you know, at a minimum bonus, $100,000.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: You know, so it's like his first year.
**Bclymer**: There's no reason he can't bring home 300 all day.
**Bclymer**: And then that's not counting if you did, you know, bring in work or whatever.
**Bclymer**: Like, that's where you start to make the commission.
**Bclymer**: Then also that's, you know, how you get a piece of the company.
**Bclymer**: Right?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, because I set this thing up to.
**Bclymer**: There's a reason it doesn't say climber construction.
**Bclymer**: You know, I set this up to be, you know, given back to the.
**Bclymer**: The people who help build it.
**Jimparker8101977**: Yeah.
**Jimparker8101977**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So, yeah, I mean, is.
**Bclymer**: Is.
**Bclymer**: I mean, if you know, 260 is like your hard number like for base salary.
**Bclymer**: Like that's going to be hard to come up on that.
**Bclymer**: You know, we want you, but we also, we want you to want to be here, right?
**Jimparker8101977**: Well, I am.
**Jimparker8101977**: I'm at a, you know, top 10 general contractor.
**Jimparker8101977**: I'm highly respected.
**Jimparker8101977**: I have lots of Runway already what I have right now and I am.
**Jimparker8101977**: It's just a very, it's, it's hard for me to come to grips of leaving that for what I'm making now without a, you know, without a bump and to leave 40k on the table on top of that.
**Jimparker8101977**: So it's just, it's hard for me to come to grips with leaving to go the 40K.
**Bclymer**: Let's, I mean, we can make that a signing bonus.
**Bclymer**: Look, let's not get fed up over $40,000.
**Jimparker8101977**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: You know, that's not a big deal.
**Bclymer**: But I, I guess.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Is that the bottom line Is base of 260 or nothing?
**Jimparker8101977**: I don't know.
**Jimparker8101977**: I'm still, I'm not closing the door on it at all.
**Jimparker8101977**: I, I mean this is just all new to me, Brandon.
**Jimparker8101977**: And I mean, I'm just, I mean, I'm glad that Jesse's got me in front of you and everything else and we're talking about this, but I just, I'm still like, it's very early in my head for me to be wanting to close the deal with y' all already and I'm just, I'm just very nervous.
**Bclymer**: No, I get it.
**Bclymer**: I understand.
**Bclymer**: Well, yeah, if you want to take some time, talk it over, you know, with the people in your head and your wife.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, whatever.
**Jimparker8101977**: Exactly.
**Jimparker8101977**: So you're basically offering 200 with a 40k signing bonus and potential bonus structure that we don't know yet.
**Bclymer**: I mean, I think that's, that's, that's really close.
**Bclymer**: You know, I don't wanna, I'm not gonna sit here and say like, oh, it's, it's that or nothing.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: But I can tell you like, you know, coming up to a base of 260 probably is going to happen like.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: You know, again, I think that like again what Jesse's told me about you and like, you know, you seem like the, the same kind of guys that we are.
**Bclymer**: Like I, I love you, part of the team, you know, but I also, you know, what people to be bought in to this.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Like.
**Jimparker8101977**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So that's where.
**Jimparker8101977**: Brandon, I get it.
**Jimparker8101977**: I get everything you're saying.
**Jimparker8101977**: I mean, if this was my company.
**Jimparker8101977**: This is exactly what I would want, too.
**Jimparker8101977**: I want people that are committed to me to do the job, to come bust their ass for me every day.
**Jimparker8101977**: I get it.
**Jimparker8101977**: And, you know, I completely understand what you're looking for, so just give me some time to think about it.
**Bclymer**: Certainly.
**Bclymer**: When do you.
**Bclymer**: I guess, do you want to.
**Bclymer**: When do you want to reach back out, or.
**Bclymer**: What are your thoughts?
**Jimparker8101977**: Let me.
**Jimparker8101977**: I'll think over the weekend and talk to my wife and everything, and we'll see what we want to do.
**Bclymer**: Okay, sounds good.
**Bclymer**: You got any other questions?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, no, I think joining us, Jim, it's that I can see that, like, the way this company's growing and being your career and just being in charge of, like, you'll be in charge of what you do and everyone else in the company.
**Bclymer**: I mean, that's.
**Jimparker8101977**: Brandon's got muscles on his forehead.
**Jimparker8101977**: And, Jesse, I don't think we can really.
**Bclymer**: I mean, that's Botox, Jim.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I'm actually 84, so.
**Jimparker8101977**: Probably born in 84.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I'm not that old.
**Bclymer**: Come on.
**Jimparker8101977**: All right, cool.
**Jimparker8101977**: Well, y' all have a good day.
**Jimparker8101977**: Thanks for the talk.
**Jimparker8101977**: Appreciate your stomp.
