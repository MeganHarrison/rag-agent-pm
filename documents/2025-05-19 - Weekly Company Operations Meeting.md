**Jdawson**: No one on site this week, so not many updates here.
**Jdawson**: We're gonna do a curb adapter.
**Jdawson**: Been fighting with this Rogers mechanical guy to get his price lower.
**Jdawson**: So he really wants to sell 2 new RTUs.
**Jdawson**: And 300k for 2 RTUs is way too much.
**Jdawson**: So we're going to do a curb adapter, hopefully raise those two existing RTUs, and then come out the side for our duct work.
**Jdawson**: Other than that, we won't be on site for a while.
**Jdawson**: It sounds like they're having delays on material delivery.
**Jdawson**: So once the C and D infill is done and the dematic platform is done, we'll go in and finish the rest of our scope.

**Adelgado**: This is Nick, too.
**Adelgado**: Is Nick back?
**Jmendez**: Yeah, I'm on here.
**Adelgado**: Oh, hi, Nick.
**Adelgado**: How are you?
**Adelgado**: So Goodwill Corp.
**Adelgado**: Office scarp code.
**Jmendez**: Yeah, we're submitting for a driveway permit.
**Adelgado**: Submitting for a driveway.
**Jmendez**: Driveway permit.
**Adelgado**: Like this?
**Gducharme**: Yes.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: Is it still in progress?
**Adelgado**: Additional permits, scheduled work with paving and striping.
**Adelgado**: Is it still not started?
**Jmendez**: Not.
**Jmendez**: Not until we get our permit.
**Adelgado**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: Status of subcontracts is done, so we don't need the done thing.
**Adelgado**: So.
**Adelgado**: Okay, so this is good.
**Ataylor**: Nick, have you talked to the fence guy there lately?
**Jmendez**: It's a fence guy hired by Goodwill.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, he is, but we've trying to coordinate that a little bit, but I would just call him.
**Ataylor**: So I don't think we've talked to him since to let him know the, like the city approved all the plans.
**Ataylor**: You know, we're just waiting on a driveway permit before we can shut down the sidewalk.
**Jmendez**: Have been.
**Jmendez**: Take down the fence.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: Well, I'd have him just finish everything he's got to finish.
**Ataylor**: Just tell him everything's approved and since he's not blocking a sidewalk, he can do whatever he needs to finish up.
**Jmendez**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: His work.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: Move on, Glenn.
**Adelgado**: Westfield Collective.
**Ataylor**: Your microphone's off.
**Kmass**: Sorry.
**Njepson**: We got some movement on drawings today.
**Njepson**: We got the mechanical and plumbing set from Spencer earlier today.
**Njepson**: Structural from Jerrica.
**Njepson**: Was supposed to be in on Friday.
**Njepson**: Told it did not come in.
**Njepson**: They're expecting it today now.
**Njepson**: And Jeff will upload that to state deem so they can get us their updated set on Wednesday.
**Njepson**: By Wednesday.
**Njepson**: And we will have everything updated for CDR at that point, obviously, with the exception of the fire alarm and the sprinkler fire suppression system, other holdups right now is just a new service and application.
**Njepson**: New service application and encroachment permit to Center Point Gas.
**Njepson**: Spoke with Brandon this morning.
**Njepson**: Came up with a plan to go ahead and start trying to get our water line in out to the first bore pit.
**Njepson**: We did not discuss during that meeting about the new gas service coming in, which is in the same boat as having to come across the parking lot.
**Njepson**: So right now, if they get.
**Njepson**: Get that in, in the, you know, three or four weeks that they have left, they'll still be a week before our asphalt that Chad has scheduled.
**Njepson**: So trying to thread that needle, I'm hoping that we don't have an extensive amount of work to do with the gas line out there from center point on the gas main.
**Njepson**: I mean, aside from that, once the rest of the CDR gets put in, we'll have, we'll have it uploaded to the ilp, to the Westfield website and then they can finish out their review.
**Njepson**: They did say they'll issue us a permit for whatever they have reviewed and whatever we have a CDR for.
**Njepson**: So at this time, we have the foundations.
**Njepson**: Mylars Platting was sent signed today.
**Njepson**: Say again, Jose.
**Ataylor**: So we have a foundation permit right now.
**Njepson**: We have the CDR release.
**Njepson**: I don't have any permit from ILP yet.
**Njepson**: They are.
**Njepson**: So it went through city.
**Njepson**: The city planning review.
**Njepson**: It's still with Ryan Collingwood at the city as of Friday.
**Njepson**: Ashton and Katie met there this morning to sign, notarize and record the plaque.
**Ataylor**: But my question is like.
**Ataylor**: And we want to start foundations in two weeks, so any past this week and not getting a permit is a problem.
**Njepson**: We need, we need the permit by, I think the 20, the second or third.
**Ataylor**: I know, but you don't want to wait till the last minute to get your.
**Njepson**: We're not waiting.
**Njepson**: We've been, we've been pushing.
**Njepson**: This isn't new.
**Njepson**: This is just an update.
**Njepson**: The last step really was getting those mylars notarized so the plaque could be recorded, which we've been working on for about eight or nine weeks.
**Njepson**: So that was finally finished up this morning.
**Njepson**: Everything that they need to review our building permit has been submitted.
**Njepson**: So it's right now with the city planner and once it goes to the building commissioner, that's when we'll get our ILP issued.
**Njepson**: And he said that he would issue whatever we had ready to go.
**Njepson**: So right now we have foundations.
**Njepson**: So they'll release us on foundations to at least keep us moving.
**Ataylor**: When is that, though?
**Njepson**: Well, they told us 10 days, which was supposed to be the 15th.
**Njepson**: And then on Friday, he.
**Njepson**: He is in.
**Njepson**: Ryan Collingwood, who is the city planner, said he doesn't have any issues with the stuff we made for changes on the PUD for the exterior.
**Njepson**: He is going to say that we have to do a rooftop mechanical screen around the RTU that we have up there.
**Njepson**: We're going to have to add that.
**Njepson**: And he says provide this modification so I can update the elevation sheet once we get reviewing on those documents in the coming week.
**Kmass**: Weeks.
**Njepson**: So.
**Ataylor**: All right, well, that can be a whole thing to those windscreens, especially like, evidently a tornado winds come through Friday and your structure.
**Ataylor**: So you need to get that worked out quick with the steel guy, Nick, to Make sure they don't have to add anything to support that frame of whatever that is.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Njepson**: So other than that they've, they've been sitting on our ILP waiting.
**Njepson**: Since they didn't have the planning, they wouldn't start reviewing.
**Njepson**: Since that's done today, they will start reviewing in the coming week weeks.
**Njepson**: So I mean as long as we get our permit by, you know, next Friday, the following Monday, we'll be, we'll be good.
**Njepson**: The rebar is about, about two weeks out, so I'm trying to get him released by tomorrow.
**Njepson**: I just got the full set of rebar for the whole building just now.
**Njepson**: Chad's giving him another look over and then we'll get him released.
**Ataylor**: Do you have windscreen on here or.
**Ataylor**: Sorry, Equipment screens is one of your points down here that needs to be.
**Njepson**: On?
**Njepson**: No, it's not on here yet.
**Njepson**: You're talking about the tasks under a task.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, yeah.
**Adelgado**: You want me to add it Glenn or.
**Njepson**: No, I me to add it.
**Adelgado**: Okay, perfect.
**Adelgado**: Go ahead and edit.
**Adelgado**: Okay, thank you Glenn.
**Adelgado**: Cormark, Jesse or Brandon.
**Adelgado**: I see is random here.
**Kmass**: Yeah, I'm on here.
**Adelgado**: Okay, good.
**Kmass**: Still don't have any fire alarm.
**Kmass**: I don't know what's going on with that damn thing.
**Kmass**: Nick, did that Seven Hills chick get back to you yet?
**Kmass**: Please?
**Jmendez**: Yeah, I wasn't able to fix it so I reached out to job planner support.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Kmass**: Gotcha.
**Kmass**: All right, so yeah, no, no, no change there.
**Kmass**: It's the same status.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: Nick spires on Lucy.
**Jmendez**: We're just waiting on the final payment.
**Adelgado**: Still waiting on.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: And then we don't have nothing here.
**Gducharme**: Okay, perfect.
**Adelgado**: AJ Neiman holding FedEx.
**Adelgado**: You're muted if you're talking.
**Adelgado**: I just cannot see you guys.
**Jdawson**: Yep, one second.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, so we got the fully executed contract.
**Jdawson**: I began releasing subs.
**Jdawson**: I gotta finish the buyout here.
**Jdawson**: The city came back with comments.
**Jdawson**: They're making us change the look of the insurance.
**Jdawson**: So I've been talking with Jerome this morning.
**Jdawson**: He's the architect and expect to have those changes here by the end of the day.
**Jdawson**: What we're going to do, she sent us an email and she wants us to match actually the other entrance that's on the other side, not the one with the big awning.
**Jdawson**: I'm not sure if it's on the other side or not.
**Jdawson**: She sent us a picture here.
**Jdawson**: Actually Jerome just sent me some changes so I actually think the cost is going to go lower.
**Ataylor**: It's.
**Jdawson**: It's hopefully going to offset but essentially it's just Going to be a, a build out with like a little flat roof on top, so we'll see.
**Jdawson**: I got to start repricing that.
**Njepson**: But.
**Jdawson**: I'm tracking on it.
**Jdawson**: So we're still tracking on a June start.
**Jdawson**: It's kind of the last piece of the puzzle.
**Jdawson**: We got guys gearing up for starting here in June, so I got.
**Adelgado**: Okay, thank you, AJ Danville Theater.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: So part of my conversations with Jerome, I'm still waiting on a structural price so I can get the owner to bite off a piece of design before we start actually doing the work.
**Jdawson**: Until then, I'm not going to spend much time on it, so I want to make sure that he's willing to pay 10 grand up front to go about it the right way and then we'll go from there.
**Adelgado**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: Applied Engineer office remodel.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: Met with them for a while on Thursday.
**Jdawson**: We got the final construction documents.
**Jdawson**: I've sent those out to the subs to to finalize their pricing.
**Jdawson**: Asked for final cost by the end of the week.
**Jdawson**: I already have a couple of them in.
**Jdawson**: I gotta start getting everything set up in job planner.
**Jdawson**: So I told applied I would have them updated pricing by the end of the week and then we can get them a contract over once we reach an agreement, start that process.
**Jdawson**: I don't have the CDR from Lydia, actually, she just sent it to us.
**Jdawson**: So now I can, I can submit for our Indianapolis permit and attach that.
**Jdawson**: That's all I got there.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: And everything is scheduled here.
**Adelgado**: So this submit to city of Indy for permits today, is that still accurate?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that's what I'm just about to do.
**Adelgado**: Okay, good.
**Adelgado**: Awesome.
**Adelgado**: Seminole Collective, this is Jesse.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, so we're, we should be released with the next city meeting.

**Ataylor**: Sent off to our civil engineer today.
**Ataylor**: He's going to give us the acreage of the parcel that Collective will use for their container complex and then that job will move forward.
**Ataylor**: As soon as the city gets the agreement with Collective, we'll get released and get the design going.
**Adelgado**: Okay.

**Ataylor**: That was done by the city.
**Adelgado**: This is done.
**Adelgado**: Okay.

**Adelgado**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: So I'll leave this here.
**Adelgado**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: Thank you, Jesse.

**Ataylor**: And he's.
**Kmass**: He's not.
**Kmass**: I.
**Kmass**: I didn't release him.
**Kmass**: I just said that would be next step.
**Kmass**: So, Mike, you know, we just need to.
**Kmass**: I guess maybe I'll call Kim and you get a price and ask Mike be it.
**Kmass**: Do you want us to go ahead and start on this or.
**Kmass**: Because I think he's still waiting on official sign off from the city.
**Kmass**: If memory serves me correct, that's what he said, I think earlier today.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Kmass**: Yeah, that's what he said.
**Ataylor**: The elevation, so.
**Kmass**: No, that's what he said.
**Kmass**: Yeah.
**Kmass**: So he said he was going to call them after you and I got off the phone with him earlier.
**Kmass**: So we're just waiting on him to.
**Kmass**: To get the sign off on the city and then that way we can.
**Kmass**: You know, he knows that it's locked in and he's.
**Kmass**: He's okay to spend money at that point.
**Adelgado**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: And Jesse, this is so the license now that I have you here, so.
**Adelgado**: Oh, you told me that you don't have.
**Adelgado**: I mean, it won't give you access to do the other business law exam once we get the permit correct.
**Adelgado**: The.
**Adelgado**: The permit.
**Adelgado**: The application.
**Adelgado**: The application correct.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: So I.
**Ataylor**: I have some documents, some originals signed in the office there in St.
**Ataylor**: Pete.
**Ataylor**: We got to just put together with the packet if everything else is ready.
**Adelgado**: I already took everything.
**Adelgado**: Yes, I already check everything, and we're just missing some signatures from you and some people that notarized the doc.
**Adelgado**: That's it.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: Okay, so we'll get back to that so we can start moving with that.
**Adelgado**: Okay, good.
**Adelgado**: Goodwill Tremont, this is Brandon and Jesse probably.
**Adelgado**: Or Nick.

**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: And again, Brandon, we're gonna.
**Ataylor**: Are we gonna give that to you just give to Jared?

**Adelgado**: You said 23rd.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: Perfect.
**Adelgado**: Uniqlo or unique.
**Adelgado**: How do you call it, Jesse?
**Adelgado**: Uniqilo.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: Wrong.
**Adelgado**: You go.
**Adelgado**: I like.
**Adelgado**: I like that one better.
**Adelgado**: Go ahead.
**Kmass**: So yeah, I say yeah, we like.
**Kmass**: Kevin, I don't know if you.
**Kmass**: Have you gotten.
**Kmass**: We got to pump these submittals out like, you know, tomorrow.
**Kmass**: Like they got it.
**Kmass**: Like, we gotta get them all processed.
**Ataylor**: Did you.
**Kmass**: Were you able to get the submittals built at least in job planner?
**Bclymer**: No, I just got access to job planner now.
**Bclymer**: So on the submittal end, we are working on putting together the submittals for the five sprinklers and for plumbing.
**Bclymer**: We just send it back to the.
**Bclymer**: To the contractor because it needs to be revised and sent back to us.
**Bclymer**: And for the fencing, we are still waiting on pricing for that eight foot fence.
**Kmass**: He's got the pricing.
**Kmass**: We wouldn't do a submittal on the fencing.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Kmass**: And as far as the plumbing, why'd you send it back?
**Bclymer**: So Kendra was telling me that he looked at it and they have realized there was some.
**Bclymer**: Some of the floor drain was not matching what was on the drawing.
**Bclymer**: So he sent it back for.
**Bclymer**: For it to be revised.
**Bclymer**: And so he sent an email out this morning to the contractor.
**Bclymer**: He said they are looking at it and they'll get back to us today.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Now when it comes to the electrical, like we.
**Ataylor**: There's some, you know, they accepted a ve to it.
**Ataylor**: So if it doesn't match the drawings, it can be an equal.
**Ataylor**: So when you're reviewing that, we can look at that.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: After you've looked through it, if you see anything that's different or you got a question on, let's look at it first.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Kmass**: Yeah.
**Kmass**: When you go into the job file, you go into owner and you look at loi letter of intent.
**Kmass**: That clarification is the bible.
**Kmass**: It overrules the drawings.
**Bclymer**: Okay.

**Jdawson**: Like, they're going through a government audit.
**Jdawson**: I can't.
**Jdawson**: I can't approve you on any work.
**Jdawson**: So I don't know what that does with our timeline.
**Jdawson**: I'll look into it.
**Jdawson**: And he may just be wanting to start because when I told him about it, he goes, oh, well, I hope it's nothing like my tax audit.
**Jdawson**: So I was like, okay.
**Jdawson**: So he's either joking or.
**Ataylor**: Or whatever.
**Kmass**: Yeah, I just texted Steve, so we'll see what he says.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I know Steve took our weekly call off, so.

**Jdawson**: I have two guys that are kind of truck slamming.
**Jdawson**: Joe's pricing up some of the interior demo that they're asking me to do.
**Jdawson**: Like, hope to have that here in the next couple of days.
**Jdawson**: All the contracts have been written for the path sent out, so it's all bought out.
**Jdawson**: So working through the right of way documents and then just kind of waiting until June when we can start.
**Adelgado**: Okay, thank you, AJ and internal project.
**Adelgado**: We need to change this.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: Estimating.
**Jdawson**: Jesse and Brandon, you don't think I need to do like mixed designs or anything?
**Jdawson**: I'm getting it all inspected by the city.
**Jdawson**: Just an asphalt path?
**Kmass**: Yeah.
**Kmass**: If the city's inspecting it, you should have a mixed design because they're going to say they're going to have a certain HMA that that asphalt has to be.
**Kmass**: So.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I was.
**Jdawson**: I mean, I figured for the concrete walk and the ADA ramps, but I'll make sure I get one for this.
**Kmass**: Yeah.
**Kmass**: If it's city owned and see, I mean, you know.
**Kmass**: Yeah.
**Kmass**: Cover your basis.
**Jdawson**: I was just trying to think of what submittals I would need for it.
**Kmass**: Yeah, I mean you'll.
**Kmass**: You'll need obviously your concrete mixed designs and Then you'll want any of your signage.
**Kmass**: Right.
**Kmass**: Here's all the ADA signage.
**Kmass**: And then you'll have your submittals for the asphalt.
**Kmass**: So you'll.
**Kmass**: You should.
**Kmass**: Again, whoever they're buying it from, the plant will have some.
**Kmass**: You know, hey, here's what we're providing.
**Jdawson**: I'll get one.
**Jdawson**: I did.
**Jdawson**: There's no concrete with this first phase.
**Jdawson**: Just 800 foot of path.
**Jdawson**: Geogrid.
**Kmass**: Yeah, you want to submit the geogrid too?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we'll see what.
**Jdawson**: See what the city says too, if they want anything more than that.
**Jdawson**: Okay, great clips.
**Jdawson**: Sunshine and Sunset.
**Jdawson**: I.
**Jdawson**: I need to.
**Jdawson**: I created the jobs in building connected.
**Jdawson**: Alex was helping me with that.
**Jdawson**: We built the packages.
**Jdawson**: I just got to send it out.
**Jdawson**: These aren't going to happen until July, maybe August.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Adelgado**: Okay.
**Kmass**: Are you gonna be able to.
**Kmass**: Are you gonna be able to hold the pricing?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I mean we're not buying.
**Jdawson**: It's all great clips.
**Jdawson**: Material is bought.
**Jdawson**: The only thing that's up in the air is the.
**Jdawson**: Is the RTU for the landlord portion.
**Jdawson**: And until I pick an H vac sub, you know, I'll cross that bridge when I get to it.
**Jdawson**: But that's why I do.
**Jdawson**: I do need to get my pricing locked in.
**Jdawson**: It's changed a couple times and now that it's gearing up, it needs to get done.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Adelgado**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: Same for Sunset.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So these are both less than a mile away from each other on the same.
**Jdawson**: On the same street.
**Jdawson**: And so the.
**Jdawson**: The plan is to use the same subs on both of them and do them at the same time.
**Adelgado**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: All right.
**Adelgado**: So.
**Adelgado**: Stungate orthodontist.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, Andres, I put a task in here this week.

**Kmass**: They're throwing a fit about it trying to get this thing.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: Madison.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I sent that budget into them.
**Jdawson**: We don't really have to do anything.
**Jdawson**: Kind of did our part.
**Jdawson**: So I'll continue to follow up.

**Jdawson**: Did look online for their GC requirements.
**Jdawson**: No requirements.
**Jdawson**: It's.
**Jdawson**: It's actually not Madison.

**Jdawson**: Jesse, he had sent something last week.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, he didn't.
**Ataylor**: He.
**Ataylor**: He just said he didn't have all the answers on it yet, so just need to meet, go through it.
**Ataylor**: But they.
**Ataylor**: They're adding this work to move an American Express like a gift card processing center from one building to the other.
**Adelgado**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: Thank you, Jesse.
**Adelgado**: Goodwill Foundation.
**Adelgado**: So you said this is a project now, correct?
**Ataylor**: Yep.
**Adelgado**: I work now.
**Adelgado**: Okay, so we'll move it.
**Adelgado**: So you said it's 25?
**Adelgado**: 111.
**Ataylor**: Yes.
**Adelgado**: Okay, I'll change it.
**Adelgado**: Something else here.
**Adelgado**: This is.
**Adelgado**: This is Andres and Glenn.
**Ataylor**: It's all Glenn now.
**Adelgado**: Mm.
**Njepson**: Jesse, are you having Andrew still be on this one or are we just keeping him on collective only from now?
**Njepson**: Did you tell.
**Njepson**: Did you tell them to stop to get.
**Ataylor**: This should just be you.
**Ataylor**: You should just type that.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Just get it bought out.
**Njepson**: Yeah, I just didn't know if you wanted him to stay involved.
**Njepson**: I sent over the stuff you asked me to.
**Njepson**: Jesse.
**Njepson**: Clarifications updated and broken out for the owners.
**Njepson**: Sent that off this morning.
**Njepson**: Updated the pricing, updated the budget.
**Njepson**: Emily didn't.
**Njepson**: Was too busy to reach out to me today I guess.
**Njepson**: So we're going to meet tomorrow morning.
**Njepson**: I'm sorry, tomorrow afternoon about 1:30 to discuss that stuff we talked about with the door and everything in the bathroom downstairs.
**Njepson**: And then she is giving me a date of 5:28.
**Njepson**: So this is next Wednesday that she'll have a plan set ready for us to do a review, give her comments so she could turn around comments the next day and then file the permit on the 29th or 30th.
**Ataylor**: All right.
**Adelgado**: Thank you, Glenn.
**Adelgado**: G.W.
**Adelgado**: andres.
**Ataylor**: That's done.
**Ataylor**: We sent it in.
**Ataylor**: So we'll just wait to hear back from the owner.
**Adelgado**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: Turner Town Homes.
**Adelgado**: Andres, also the same.
**Adelgado**: Waiting to get back to you.
**Ataylor**: This again.
**Ataylor**: We're just waiting on the owner to respond if they want to move forward or not.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: Siva Doctors and flooring.
**Adelgado**: Andres.
**Ataylor**: So that one is.
**Ataylor**: That's now a job.
**Ataylor**: Okay, we need to make that.
**Ataylor**: We haven't.
**Ataylor**: It'll just be whatever the next number is.
**Kmass**: We got a P.O.
**Kmass**: from.
**Ataylor**: Well, we don't have a P.O.
**Ataylor**: but they told us to proceed with it.
**Kmass**: I thought Stephen did.
**Kmass**: Chris.
**Kmass**: Query.
**Ataylor**: Okay, then we haven't been released, but on that one, we need to.
**Ataylor**: 113 is goodwill.
**Ataylor**: Noblesville.
**Ataylor**: We should.
**Ataylor**: That shouldn't be a job yet.
**Kmass**: Goodwill Novasville.
**Ataylor**: Someone put it in the folder here.
**Ataylor**: 20, 25 jobs.
**Ataylor**: Some.
**Kmass**: I mean, it's.
**Kmass**: You could probably leave it there.
**Kmass**: It's going to go through.
**Gducharme**: Who.
**Kmass**: Who did that?
**Kmass**: Who created that?
**Kmass**: Nick, was that you?
**Kmass**: Yeah.
**Jmendez**: You wanted to see the drawings?
**Jmendez**: I guess I should have looked at the estimating folder.
**Kmass**: Yeah.
**Kmass**: So is.
**Kmass**: Is that all that's in there, is just the drawings?
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Kmass**: All right, why don't you go ahead and.
**Kmass**: And delete that folder and go into the estimating and drop the drawings in there.
**Kmass**: So if anybody ever creates a job.
**Kmass**: Okay, we never go in and create a new folder.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Kmass**: You just simply take the estimating folder, move it to the job folder, and then rename it into the actual title.
**Kmass**: Does that make sense?
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Adelgado**: Okay, so what will be the number, Jesse?
**Adelgado**: 25.
**Kmass**: We don't worry about it.
**Ataylor**: It's.
**Kmass**: It.
**Kmass**: He's gonna.
**Kmass**: It's not actually created.
**Kmass**: He's going to delete it.
**Kmass**: It's going to stay in estimating, you know, until we get a, you know, confirmation that, hey, here's the P.O.
**Kmass**: right?
**Kmass**: We don't have a.
**Kmass**: Right now.
**Kmass**: We don't have a number until we have a.
**Kmass**: Hey, you're good to go for X.
**Kmass**: It really doesn't exist.
**Kmass**: Like, unless it's.
**Kmass**: Unless it's something like, you know, some of these, you know, jobs with, like, the collectives, where they're gonna, you know, get us an LOI and release for design.
**Kmass**: Then it's like, all right, we got actual, you know, real costs.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Kmass**: Jesse.
**Kmass**: Agree with that.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, I agree.
**Ataylor**: I think we just, myself included, put some things in the 2025 job folder that hadn't been fully released yet.
**Gducharme**: So.
**Adelgado**: Okay, so leave it there.
**Adelgado**: Gpc, Harrisburg.
**Adelgado**: Brandon.
**Kmass**: I'm trying to get the guy Sam on the phone to confirm and basically sell that job to him.
**Kmass**: So that's kind of the big thing.
**Adelgado**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: Siva perfume store.
**Adelgado**: Same.
**Adelgado**: Brandon.
**Kmass**: We haven't got a PO or anything on that, so, you know, still waiting.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: Demo.
**Adelgado**: AJ.
**Kmass**: You'Re muted.
**Kmass**: AJ, once again.
**Ataylor**: AJ, you're muted.
**Gducharme**: A.J.
**Kmass**: You'Re still muted.
**Kmass**: A.J.
**Jdawson**: Can you hear me now?
**Kmass**: Yes.
**Kmass**: When you click that microphone button, it makes you go off mute.
**Jdawson**: I didn't think you guys wanted to hear my burps.
**Kmass**: We don't want to hear you in general, but we're forced to.
**Jdawson**: No update.
**Kmass**: Wow.
**Jdawson**: Last week in June, they're going in front of the real estate committee.
**Jdawson**: So for now, I keep it on there.
**Jdawson**: It's definitely a job.
**Kmass**: It just.
**Adelgado**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Not worth our time right now.
**Adelgado**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: High tech in this strawman, Brandon.
**Kmass**: I mean, that's a.
**Kmass**: That's a Siva job.
**Kmass**: I'm, you know, confident it'll come our way.
**Kmass**: It's just waiting on them.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: Radial Avon, this is Jesse and Andres.
**Kmass**: Well, we got a loi today.
**Adelgado**: Thanks.
**Jdawson**: How much did that end up coming out to be?
**Jdawson**: How many dock doors?
**Kmass**: 30 dock doors.
**Kmass**: So we need to.
**Kmass**: We need to price up this Dr.
**Kmass**: Geek plus stuff, Jesse.
**Kmass**: Right.
**Kmass**: Price up to geek.
**Kmass**: Geek Plus.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, we got this.
**Ataylor**: Well, we got to figure out a little more details.
**Ataylor**: Unless.
**Ataylor**: Do they expect us to know from her email what she wants done or we need to go back to the site, and we shouldn't have to go back.
**Kmass**: We shouldn't have to go back to the site considering we did all that work.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Is that.
**Jdawson**: Is that the same building?
**Kmass**: Yeah, basically, yeah.
**Kmass**: All the Geek plus stuff that we did, they want to take hell out.
**Jdawson**: They want to take it all out.
**Kmass**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So the robots don't work?
**Kmass**: No, they do.
**Kmass**: They just have a new tenant.
**Ataylor**: Oh, damn.
**Kmass**: So, yeah, so we need to price up that.
**Ataylor**: So that's something we can just send to Brennan and say, hey, price up this electrical work.
**Gducharme**: Correct.
**Kmass**: Yeah, probably want to.
**Kmass**: I'll probably have to call him since him and I did that, kind of.
**Ataylor**: Go through it together.
**Kmass**: But so, like.
**Kmass**: So for task, Maria put, you know, pricing for Geek plus or B plus.
**Gducharme**: Geek.
**Kmass**: G.
**Kmass**: Geek plus.
**Adelgado**: Like this?
**Kmass**: Yep.
**Kmass**: Yep.

**Jdawson**: Hopefully you're able to give that To Mike Coleman.
**Kmass**: It's not what?
**Kmass**: Different manufacturer.
**Ataylor**: Ah, so it's actually doc subcontractor or doctor.
**Adelgado**: You're telling me that.
**Adelgado**: Is it wrong?
**Ataylor**: Yeah, it's.
**Ataylor**: It's doc dock and then door.
**Adelgado**: Doctor.
**Adelgado**: Yeah, there you go.
**Ataylor**: It's Brandon's doctor.

**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: Perfect.
**Adelgado**: You say create the job as well, Jesse.
**Adelgado**: Or is it.
**Adelgado**: That's enough here.
**Ataylor**: But we just need to assign a project manager.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: Next.
**Jdawson**: One.
**Adelgado**: Part of this aisle.
**Adelgado**: This is Brandon and Jesse.
**Kmass**: I mean, that's.
**Kmass**: We already did our meeting with that guy.
**Kmass**: Yeah.
**Kmass**: I mean, it's just waiting on.

**Kmass**: Did who.
**Kmass**: Who drew up that?
**Kmass**: Is that Andres that did that?
**Ataylor**: Yeah, yeah.
**Adelgado**: So in progress.
**Adelgado**: And floor plan.
**Adelgado**: But the floor plan is done, correct?
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Gducharme**: Okay, good.
**Adelgado**: So we don't need this.
**Adelgado**: Let me just filter this.
**Adelgado**: Okay, good.
**Adelgado**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: Ulta Beauty, Fresno.
**Adelgado**: Andres and Jesse.
**Gducharme**: Tomorrow we could check the.
**Ataylor**: I don't know if we got any more info on what they want to do there.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, Say.
**Kmass**: Yeah, I mean, that's.
**Kmass**: Walter is.
**Kmass**: You know, he said he was going to send it.
**Kmass**: Send me the drawings.
**Kmass**: He hasn't sent him yet.
**Kmass**: So I.
**Kmass**: I will follow up again.
**Kmass**: But I also.
**Kmass**: I don't know.
**Kmass**: I'm torn.
**Kmass**: Like, part of me, like, says, okay, I'll follow up.
**Kmass**: But then I'm also worried that he'll do.
**Kmass**: Oh, here you go.
**Kmass**: And then we have nobody to do it right.
**Ataylor**: Through all the licensing out in California.
**Jdawson**: Is that what your.
**Jdawson**: Is that what your issue is, Brandon?
**Jdawson**: The licensing?
**Kmass**: No.
**Kmass**: I mean, no, I'm not worried about that.
**Kmass**: Especially because, you know, assuming, like, first of all, they recognize nascar.
**Kmass**: I'm not too worried about that.
**Kmass**: And secondly, if he.
**Kmass**: If it.
**Kmass**: Look, what he said to me was he wants to do the air conditioning, like what we did in Greenwood.
**Kmass**: And so, I mean, we.
**Kmass**: We don't really.
**Kmass**: I mean, hvc.
**Kmass**: Guy would do that.
**Kmass**: I mean, we don't really even have to pull a license, per se.
**Kmass**: Now I'm saying that without knowing, you know, I'm not built in California, so I don't know per se, but that's just my, My thoughts.
**Jdawson**: Be nice to get our foot in the door out there.
**Kmass**: I mean, this isn't exactly the foot in the door project, you know, just replacing a bunch of RTUs or adding new ones.
**Kmass**: But maybe, I mean, you know, now I think about it, that's going to have seismic, so, you know, that's going to have to go in.
**Kmass**: Structurally, everything's going to be.
**Jdawson**: We did in Dallas.
**Jdawson**: We should, we should price that up because I think we can make some money on it.
**Kmass**: Did I, did you.
**Kmass**: Did I say we weren't.
**Jdawson**: That.
**Jdawson**: You said you were.
**Jdawson**: You weren't gonna maybe follow up with them?
**Kmass**: Yeah, I said.
**Kmass**: Because, like, not that we're not gonna do it, just if I press him right now, I'm worried that.
**Kmass**: Okay, here you go.
**Kmass**: Can you give me number two weeks?
**Kmass**: Like, you know.
**Kmass**: No.
**Kmass**: Like, you know, you don't have any time to do it.
**Kmass**: Like, it's not that I'm not wanting to do the job.
**Kmass**: It's.
**Kmass**: It's a catch 22.
**Kmass**: Right.
**Kmass**: Want to miss it.
**Kmass**: But I also, you know, we have, you know, so much going on right now.
**Kmass**: I don't know what we would do, but I've got it on my list, literally.
**Kmass**: I was going to email, you know, respond to his last email and just follow up.
**Kmass**: I mean, what do you.
**Kmass**: I mean.
**Kmass**: Yeah, Jesse, what do you think?
**Kmass**: I mean, you know, as far as licensing and whatnot.
**Kmass**: I mean, we haven't even looked, I guess.
**Kmass**: Maria, do you want to put that on your task list?
**Kmass**: Like, look into what goes into getting that California license.
**Kmass**: It should just be a business and law, but see what all documents we have to do.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, let's check with that specific municipality.
**Ataylor**: What do they require and.
**Adelgado**: Okay, I'll check.
**Adelgado**: Yeah, we'll see.
**Adelgado**: Okay, perfect.
**Adelgado**: Tampa office building.
**Adelgado**: Andres and Jesse.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, Tomorrow we could check the drone.
**Kmass**: Say that again.
**Ataylor**: He got back to you.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: So that's the drawing with a third office building.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, I have finalized that.
**Gducharme**: We could check it tomorrow morning.
**Gducharme**: Now.
**Ataylor**: What'D he say to you last week, Brandon?
**Kmass**: He just said that he wanted to get a, you know, if we could give him a square foot number for the office and, you know, he wanted to see about putting a third office building there.
**Kmass**: And then he wanted to make sure that we were good on the parking numbers.
**Ataylor**: So Andres, if you just.
**Ataylor**: I mean, as long as we exceed or match the number of spaces that the other two office buildings have proportionately, like that many times three.
**Ataylor**: Just make sure that fits and then we should be fine.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: Perfect.
**Adelgado**: And last one.
**Adelgado**: 1320 or.
**Adelgado**: Yeah, for Market the mice.
**Adelgado**: AJ Andres.
**Gducharme**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: So I sent that budget to him last week.
**Jdawson**: No update at this time.
**Jdawson**: He said that they're just waiting to hear what their tenant wants to do and they'll be in touch very soon.
**Ataylor**: What is that project about?
**Jdawson**: It's a.
**Jdawson**: This property manager reach out to me.
**Njepson**: Through a referral.
**Jdawson**: They.
**Jdawson**: He.
**Jdawson**: They're based out of Kentucky.
**Jdawson**: They own a bunch of these strip malls.
**Jdawson**: Basically, they have one tenant that has too much space and they want to reduce their space.
**Jdawson**: And so we have to.
**Gducharme**: They.
**Jdawson**: They busted this demising wall down or put poke throughs through it.
**Jdawson**: Well, now they want to fill it in, rent the other side out, and then remodel that.
**Jdawson**: So it's not a huge job at first, but there's more work to come from.
**Jdawson**: Would take.
**Jdawson**: It would take one truck Slamming Joe.
**Jdawson**: You just got to fill it.
**Jdawson**: I bet a painter could do it.
**Jdawson**: Honestly, fill in the holes.
**Jdawson**: We got to move a little bit of sprinkler, maybe a diffuser or two.
**Jdawson**: But I just sent him, you know, back a napkin budget, so he's seeing if the numbers make sense and how the tenant wants to proceed.
**Adelgado**: Okay, perfect.
**Adelgado**: Something else here, guys, that we need to add.
