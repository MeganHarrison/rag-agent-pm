## Transcript
**Acannon**: Justin.
**Jremillard**: Hey, Chris.
**Chris.query**: You guys are gonna love us.
**Jdawson**: Oh, okay.
**Chris.query**: I'm telling you that's a good way.
**Jdawson**: To start the conversation, I suppose.
**Chris.query**: Just I'm telling you, like you guys are gonna be like, this is gonna save us because right now you have a power problem.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, well, I think first things first, once Hermes gets on here, we'll, I think the lighting is probably the first topic we'll cover and then we can go into the, the battery solution that you guys sent some documentation on once that's over with.
**Chris.query**: See, look at that.
**Chris.query**: Bill is in awe right now.
**Chris.query**: That's, he's like, oh my gosh, this is such a good thing.
**Acannon**: Absolutely.
**William.twickler**: Okay.
**William.twickler**: Hermes on.
**Jdawson**: Okay, I think everybody's here.
**Jdawson**: So Hermes, if you want to go ahead and I guess we'll talk about the lighting first.
**William.twickler**: Well, yeah, I mean we were calling and probably I would turn over this more to Bill.
**William.twickler**: Bill, some of the question about the proposal and also the, the, the type of lighting and all fixtures and also the amount of panels that is a detail in the proposal.
**William.twickler**: So I think that was more some of the question that we were having thinking the amount of panels, you know, is that a.
**William.twickler**: We thought it was kind of a lot of amount of panels that would be installed for lighting.
**William.twickler**: But Bill, probably a bit better turn it off to you.
**William.twickler**: You got all, you have all the details.
**Acannon**: Yeah.
**Acannon**: Hey, I'm going to let Chris.
**Acannon**: Chris, Chris kind of like has been studying this.
**Acannon**: I'm going to let Chris kind of talk to it.
**Acannon**: But I think those are the two topics.
**Acannon**: The specific fixtures themselves and then the, you know, how we're distributing the electric and the, the number of panels that are being suggested here.
**Acannon**: So Chris, you want to kind of start adding some context to that place.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Yeah.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: So Brandon, in your, in your proposal or Jesse, whichever one put that together, you got 13, 400amp additional panels just for the lighting.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: What's, what's your reasoning for that?
**Chris.query**: So that's just a base calculation I did based on the area like spaced out evenly.
**Chris.query**: It's not, again, we have to do an actual electrical drawing study and to figure out it may be a little bit less.
**Chris.query**: But remember those panel sizes, those are not 480, those are 120.
**Chris.query**: So as far as the amount of power used, it's.
**Chris.query**: It's more like 700 or to a thousand.
**Chris.query**: Yeah.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: So why would we go with 120 vs 277?
**Hermes.rodriguez**: That's one increases the load and then you got to have step down transformers for each one of those panels.
**Chris.query**: We're Going to have a, we're going to have a step down transformer to step down from the 480 down to the 277, 120.
**Chris.query**: Either way, like, no matter what, we're going to step down and feed all those panels.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Well, you don't have to step down if you use 480, 277, you just get directly from your main gear.
**Chris.query**: But to run that kind, I mean.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: You'Re gonna pull this one, you're gonna pull a lot more load.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: You're gonna double over, you know, double your load if you go 120.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: And then the other issue is there's not enough main panels to feed 13 additional 400amp panels because currently you only have three 800amp panels in the building.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Now we've got, we can add additional four more, you know, 800, which we're gonna have to anyway for batteries, you know, chargers and stuff.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: To me, it just doesn't make sense to, to go with 120.
**Chris.query**: No, and, and, and yeah, that's, you know, I'm not gonna act like I'm an electrical engineer, Chris.
**Chris.query**: And, and you are, you are exactly right.
**Chris.query**: Like, so whenever I did this, whatever, a week and a half ago, like, we were just, I was just trying to figure it out and go, okay, what do we need to feed this?
**Chris.query**: And I was doing a, you know, a budget to get it together before we even had any pricing.
**Chris.query**: But now, you know, we actually got, you know, pricing in and we understand what it is.
**Chris.query**: So whether we, we go 120 or 277, we've backed into the power number.
**Chris.query**: And you know, I'll, I can get with the electrical engineer, you know, that we have on this now.
**Chris.query**: And I'm sure that he's like, yeah, Brandon, we're not going to do 120.
**Chris.query**: You're an idiot.
**Chris.query**: So either way, like, you are correct, like we are going to do, you know, probably 277 and stretch it out versus having step down and all those panels.
**Chris.query**: That's just, that's just me backing into a number based off of what you guys needed in three days.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: And technically a 400amp panel, if you dedicate it to all single phase lighting, that panel is actually good for 1200amps.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: So each phase is good for 400.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Now if you start with three phase equipment, that takes it down and I.
**Chris.query**: Think we can actually stretch it out a little bit more based off of what I'm here now.
**Chris.query**: You got me.
**Acannon**: Yeah.
**Chris.query**: So what I was saying was we know that this is not going to be a hundred percent burning.
**Chris.query**: They're all based off of motion.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Yeah.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: You know, with, with this business and you know, it's going to be.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: There's going to be a lot of trucks in those aisles.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: So those lights are going to stay on quite a bit.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: I mean, there's going to be a lot of movement in there to keep them on.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: So I would say probably any given time, you're probably going to have 75, 80 of your fixtures on, it's my guess.
**Chris.query**: Chrissy there.
**Chris.query**: Yeah, yeah.
**Chris.query**: I mean, I can't hear me.
**Chris.query**: Hear anybody.
**Jremillard**: Can you hear us, Brandon?
**Jremillard**: We can hear you on and off.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Bill, can you hear me?
**Acannon**: Yeah, Chris, I can hear you.
**Acannon**: I've heard everything you've said.
**Jremillard**: Okay, now, Chris, we'll get.
**Jremillard**: I'm sure we'll be fine.
**Jremillard**: The electrician, I confirmed this morning 700amp total we would require for the warehouse lights.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Just 700amps?
**Jremillard**: That's what he told me.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: For the warehouse lighting.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Well, if you've got 22, 60 pictures, what's a, what's the lumens on those and what's the wattage equal?
**Jremillard**: These say they're 70% lumen.
**Jremillard**: They're.
**Jremillard**: See, I can share my screen here.
**Chris.query**: Did you get the cut correct, Chris?
**Chris.query**: Yeah, I sent it to him.
**Chris.query**: Yeah, Chris, got it.
**Chris.query**: And so, so, so go to the next page, Jesse.
**Chris.query**: So, Chris, this is what I based it off of, you know, when I initially did this.
**Chris.query**: But like in the last week researching it, I've got some lights that we can.
**Chris.query**: It looks like I can get sooner.
**Chris.query**: So we probably won't go with this, this same brand.
**Chris.query**: We'll probably go with a different brand just based off of when I talked to Bill and Hermes, you know, whatever, two days ago or something like that in their timeline.
**Chris.query**: As far as, you know, I think, you know, we're talking about the second week of July coming in and laying out.
**Chris.query**: So we'll probably end up switching, I think, just because these are six weeks and I think I can get the other ones in almost four.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Okay.
**Acannon**: So let me add this.
**Acannon**: So we're.
**Acannon**: So we're trying to get, we're very serious about this.
**Acannon**: We're trying to get more comfortable with your design, you know, and I know perhaps you don't have the design fully finalized right now, but we want to make sure that.
**Acannon**: Going back to our original objective, our original objective is to have 30 foot candles in the aisles and 40 foot candles at the inbound and outbound dock.
**Acannon**: So we want to make sure that Whatever you're doing here, you know, supports that and that, you know, again, some of the, some of the questions that Chris had, you know, kind of links back to that.
**Acannon**: What's the most efficient way to run, run all this so that we're comfortable with, you know, with the technical part of the, of this approach.
**Acannon**: I guess that's really kind of where we are right now.
**Chris.query**: And so, you know, I can, I'm.
**Acannon**: Not used to, I can tell you this, Bill, I'm not used to 120 volts to, you know, most, most everything I've seen in warehouses always been 277.
**Acannon**: And if it was just used for calculation, but that's one thing.
**Acannon**: But I guess I'm just, we're just trying to be 100% comfortable with what you got here.
**Chris.query**: So Bill, I can tell you again, this is me doing calculations off three days and I am by no means an electrical engineer or even the smartest person on this call for that matter.
**Acannon**: So.
**Chris.query**: But I can guarantee you that we are going to meet your 30 foot candles and 40 foot candles and their perspective areas per their design parameters.
**Chris.query**: Like now again, if that's, I said 2200 light 60, just so you knew my calcs.
**Chris.query**: But like what, what maybe is, it's going to be 2000 lights at a higher lumen, whatever it is, but the end of the day we are going to match exactly what you need.
**Chris.query**: I've already got the photometrics and work.
**Chris.query**: Hopefully I'll have it by tomorrow finished.
**Chris.query**: But we already know that like we are going to meet exactly what it is.
**Chris.query**: And if for some reason, let's say I'm wrong, which just happened in time or two, and it cost me 300,000 extra dollars, then I will eat that and make sure that you have exactly what you need.
**Jremillard**: Yes, I would agree though they're going to end up being 277 volt lights.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: But you had mentioned, Jesse, that the total load would be 700amps.
**Jremillard**: That's what we got from our electrician this morning.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: I can't because if you convert 60,000 lumens to watts, that's 675 watts.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: So that's on 277, that's still over two amps per fixture.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: And if you have 2260, that's almost 5,000, 5,000amps right here.
**Chris.query**: So take that, take that, take that 2200 number of light fixtures.
**Chris.query**: Disregard that.
**Chris.query**: All we're doing, like what, what he did when he did the calculation, he backed into the foot candle requirement.
**Chris.query**: So I I backed it.
**Chris.query**: I said, here's the numbers I did, here's my calps.
**Chris.query**: What Jesse's referring to is when they went in and said, all right, here you're going, we're going to use, you know, higher lumen fixtures or different fixtures, more spread out to get this foot candle.
**Chris.query**: Like, you know, I, I based that off of other projects that we did that were like this and backed into the number to figure out what that lighting looked like.
**Chris.query**: And then in the last week, as we've gone through design and trying to refine it, it's like, all right, here's what we are actually going to do.
**Chris.query**: So that's how that number changes as far as lighting, electrical amps needed.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: But I have to look at what you're proposing.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: I mean, to move forward, we gotta, we gotta know all the details.
**Chris.query**: Yeah.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: And it's gonna change.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: We need to know that as well.
**Chris.query**: So, so what if, if you would like, we can change it and just say, hey, we are going to meet 30 foot candles in the aisles and 40 foot candles in the highlighted yellow area, which is what we, we, we tried to do here on this drawing.
**Chris.query**: And we can adjust that and say, you know, forget about the, the number of lights, we are going to meet your requirement, which is what we're doing.
**Chris.query**: Would that help?
**William.twickler**: Well, basically, what's going to happen after the electrical engineer finalize the design?
**William.twickler**: Then you're going to really know for sure the changes and even could be, or more fixtures, or less fixtures or more panels.
**William.twickler**: Less panels.
**William.twickler**: And then like you said, I mean, what, really, you know, what it matters for us just to meet the food candle.
**William.twickler**: We will find out if the changes whenever the electrical engineer finalize the design.
**Chris.query**: Correct.
**Chris.query**: Yeah.
**Chris.query**: I'm not going to sit here and pretend like I'm an electrical engineer.
**Chris.query**: But what I can guarantee you is that you are going to get your specifications met.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Yeah, but my concern, Brandon, is, you know, 13 panels, even if you come back and say we're going to install 10 panels, 400amp panels, we don't have the power right now to feed those panels.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: So then you could come back and say, well, now we got to add two more 800amp panels to feed the 400amps.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Does that make sense?
**Chris.query**: Yes, I understand.
**Chris.query**: And as far as your lighting goes, like, you have the power required.
**Chris.query**: Like, again, I, I, I apologize for the confusion I caused by putting in my calculations.
**Chris.query**: This is why engineers are, are useful no matter how, what, what we think at times, because they are going to tell us exactly what we need which you were right.
**Chris.query**: It is going to be less.
**Chris.query**: It's going to be 277, not 120.
**Chris.query**: So yes, we will back back into that and you know, we can even again revise it and put in there like, you know, we expect to take you know, whatever 700 or a thousand, whatever that actual number is of 480.
**Chris.query**: And if you want to see how we get to that calculation, we're happy to show you that calculation as well, Chris.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Yeah, I mean, I think we'll need, we'll need to see that because again, I'm not looking just at the lighting.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: I am this call, but I am looking down the road for, you know, we're gonna need power for the battery chargers.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: We're gonna need additional power for conveyor.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: You know, if we use up all the power now, I mean, we've got to have the additional 800, you know, the panels in there.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Yeah, I mean we're gonna, we're gonna push that 6,000amp that we get from the utility now.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: We're going to push that and probably use all that.
**Chris.query**: Yeah.
**Chris.query**: And you're, you're, you're exactly right.
**Chris.query**: Like we.
**Chris.query**: With our, with your current design parameters and everything, your battery chargers are going to take up an enormous amount of that capacity.
**Chris.query**: Which is, is why we were, you know, from day one started researching and figuring out, all right, how can we reduce this to where we can make this entire thing work with the power that they have at the building.
**Chris.query**: Because bringing a new service and it's just the time frame for that is not going to work for you guys.
**Chris.query**: And so that's why we, so that's why we came like again, you know, to Jesse's credit, like, you know, he really bird dogged this to make sure that we found a solution that we believe will work for you guys and not only save you from having to add another service, but save you on your, you know, forklift side to where you don't have to instead of having whatever it is, 40 chargers only, you know, 20 or whatever.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Okay, well, that was what my main question, why, you know, looking at 120 versus 277.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Because you're going to cut your.
**Chris.query**: Yeah, Chris, that, that is just me being wrong flat out.
**Chris.query**: So that is, that is me doing a calculation to get you guys a quick budget and just not, not putting the right voltage on there.
**Chris.query**: So there's, there's nothing else on that.
**Chris.query**: I don't.
**Chris.query**: So I just, I just messed up.
**Jremillard**: We got this recorded on Fireflies too.
**Jremillard**: So we can reference it anytime.
**Chris.query**: Make sure you send it out to send it out to everybody.
**Chris.query**: It's recorded.
**Chris.query**: Brandon admitted he just messed up.
**Chris.query**: But I can tell you that, you know, we have, you know, now that I've had a week to work on this, like we know that we've got the, like we're going to be able to meet the 30 foot candle and 40 foot candle requirements that you need.
**Chris.query**: So we can pull out, you know, whatever panels or lighting numbers and we can just say, hey, we are going to meet this and this and these two are going to take whatever that is.
**Chris.query**: 750 volts of 480, blah, blah.
**Chris.query**: We can spell that out.
**Chris.query**: Say here's the calculation for us to get to that so that you feel, you know, comfortable and you know exactly what we're thinking and make sure that, you know, you agree with it.
**Acannon**: So, so, so, so Brandon, let me ask you this.
**Acannon**: If we gave you guys till tomorrow morning, is it possible to come to us with a little more detail that makes us feel more comfortable besides just saying, hey, we're going to meet this.
**Acannon**: I mean, I guess, I mean, I appreciate you saying that and taking responsibility.
**Acannon**: At the same time, we want to make sure that there's no gaps here, that, that, that everything will, you know, will work.
**Chris.query**: Yeah.
**Chris.query**: If you, yeah, we can, we can go in and spell that out and you know, send it to you so it's, it's in writing so that everybody's on the same page.
**William.twickler**: Can you, can you bring like some kind of electrical engineer or electrician who can kind of, you know, give us more detail like Bill said, But at least from you guys, you bring a lot of somebody else with a lot of more expertise, then he can just give a lot of more detail and really more discretion explanation or you know, what he think about it?
**Chris.query**: Yeah, we're going to pull the exact information from our, from our oxcorposal like, like Jesse said, you know, we just got the confirmation for this, I think what, yesterday morning or maybe last night or something like that?
**Chris.query**: Exactly.
**Chris.query**: Like, hey, this is how many amps this is going to take.
**Chris.query**: So yes, we can spell that out and it, we have all the information straight from the, the electrical engineer and then that way you guys know exactly how it looks.
**Acannon**: Yeah, I think, I think it would be good if the, if, if.
**Chris.query**: We.
**Jremillard**: Can either get a, get Bill you a drawing showing, hey, here's the panels.
**Jremillard**: Basically, here's the panels.
**Jremillard**: They're feeding this many lights on each one and, and that'll will get something like that from the electrician.
**Acannon**: Chris, how would you feel about that?
**Acannon**: But I also think it would be good to know what the fixture is that is going to be used here.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Yeah, I think we need the specs on that.
**Chris.query**: Yeah, I'll get you a cut sheet on the other.
**Chris.query**: On the other fixture.
**Chris.query**: Yeah, I just.
**Chris.query**: The, the other fixture came about literally yesterday as once we talked in our meeting, Bill and Hermes, you know, I went to work trying to say, all right, what can we do?
**Chris.query**: Like, what else can I get that meets these specs but I can get sooner?
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Hey, Brandon, also in your quote under exclusions and clarifications on line three, it says lighting is figured to provide 30 lumens in the rack areas and 40 lumens in the speed banks.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Did you mean foot candles there?
**Chris.query**: Yeah, yes, sorry.
**Chris.query**: It should be foot candles.
**Chris.query**: Yes, you're correct.
**Acannon**: It should be.
**Acannon**: That's what we would absolutely like to see.
**Acannon**: That expressed in foot candles.
**Acannon**: Correct.
**Chris.query**: Yeah, that's, that's fine.
**Chris.query**: That's just a typo error.
**Chris.query**: Yes, it is book candles.
**Chris.query**: So you just.
**Chris.query**: We'll, we'll.
**Chris.query**: We'll say FC average, right?
**Chris.query**: Hey, yeah, 30.
**Chris.query**: 30 and.
**Chris.query**: 30 and 40 lumens would.
**Chris.query**: I mean, you need a flashlight to walk around.
**Chris.query**: So.
**Chris.query**: Yeah, so we'll, we'll get it adjusted so that it meets it and we'll, we'll spell it all out.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Yeah, I mean, we, we'd really just like to see the exact scope of work that, you know, we're going to get.
**Chris.query**: Yeah, I, I totally understand what you're saying, Chris.
**Acannon**: You know, again, so let me ask you this.
**Acannon**: You were saying that the photometrics are in process.
**Acannon**: I mean, how quick do you expect to see those?
**Acannon**: You said tomorrow.
**Acannon**: I mean, is that tomorrow morning or.
**Chris.query**: They're building it today.
**Chris.query**: So I'll call them after this to see, hey, like, can you push this out, you know, and see if I can get it, you know, before noon tomorrow or so?
**Chris.query**: But yes, and we.
**Chris.query**: Pushing them to knock it out.
**Acannon**: Okay.
**Chris.query**: So just so that we're on the same page for the lighting.
**Chris.query**: So we'll go ahead and adjust the verbiage so it matches the specs.
**Chris.query**: You know, I'll grab the photometric and we'll give clarity on.
**Chris.query**: Here's the light fixture that we're thinking, you know, and here's how we're calculating the power usage.
**Acannon**: And one comment.
**Acannon**: I know, Chris, you had brought this up.
**Acannon**: We've got in.
**Acannon**: We've got some existing panels there, correct?
**Acannon**: I mean, are you using Any of those existing panels, or are you just going to use new panels?
**Chris.query**: Talk about the existing panels that feed those warehouse lights right now.
**Chris.query**: Yeah, I mean, we would feed out of them for the.
**Chris.query**: The lights that.
**Chris.query**: That fit right there.
**Chris.query**: So kind of like what we talked about, if we were to repurpose those lights for that first section.
**Chris.query**: It just really.
**Chris.query**: Part of it depends on where you guys are going to start your racking.
**Chris.query**: Right.
**Chris.query**: If you're going to start it right next to that, then that.
**Chris.query**: That works out great.
**Chris.query**: If you're not, you know, it doesn't make sense to.
**Chris.query**: To use that panel for.
**Chris.query**: For that we would readjust.
**Acannon**: Right.
**Acannon**: But I don't think.
**Acannon**: Correct me if I'm wrong, those lights that we have in there now wouldn't support the VNA area.
**Acannon**: Is that correct?
**Hermes.rodriguez**: That's correct, Bill.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: They're not.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: They're not a narrow aisle fixture.
**Chris.query**: Yeah, we would use too much lighting.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: On that top level.
**Chris.query**: I think we would use them in the speed bays.
**Acannon**: Yes.
**Acannon**: Correct.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Yeah, correct.
**Chris.query**: Because that speed bay area is going to be starting to be used right away.
**Chris.query**: Correct?
**Acannon**: Yes.
**Chris.query**: Yeah.
**Acannon**: One thing I would say, too, so.
**Jremillard**: So.
**Acannon**: And Jared, correct me if I'm wrong, but, Brandon, one of the questions that you had.
**Acannon**: I think you were.
**Acannon**: You had mentioned this yesterday about.
**Acannon**: With your photometrics and all that.
**Acannon**: I mean, you're asking about how high the racking is.
**Chris.query**: Yeah, 36 or 40.
**Acannon**: So the pallet racking uprights are 36, and the case racking is 37.
**Chris.query**: Okay, so.
**Chris.query**: So top of product is 36 to 37.
**Chris.query**: Correct.
**Acannon**: Is that.
**Acannon**: Is that correct, Jared?
**Jdawson**: I believe it's going to extend higher than 36ft.
**Jdawson**: Let me get to the actual.
**Jdawson**: Let me open the drawing.
**Jdawson**: I'll get you the dimensions here in a second.
**Acannon**: I know that's what the uprights are.
**Acannon**: I don't know about the pallets.
**Acannon**: I mean, about the material.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, it's.
**Jdawson**: Bill, it's going to go higher.
**Jdawson**: Just give me a moment.
**Jdawson**: I'll pull it up.
**Chris.query**: Yeah.
**Chris.query**: If you can let us know exactly what that is, then we'll just.
**Chris.query**: We just need to adjust it, obviously, because if you have a palette that's going to go at a.
**Chris.query**: Let's call it 39, you know, whatever that is, then we can't get the lighting coverage.
**Chris.query**: So I just want to make sure we're accurate in the photometric.
**Acannon**: And this is all going to be LED lighting.
**Acannon**: Is that correct?
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Yep.
**Chris.query**: Yeah, that's pretty much what you always use anymore.
**Acannon**: Exactly.
**Acannon**: No, no.
**Acannon**: Just asking for clarity.
**Chris.query**: Yeah.
**Chris.query**: They'll all be led motion sensor, and then you'll have battery backups on the emergency one.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Brandon, do you plan on removing all the current circuits?
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Are you going to leave those in place and just.
**Chris.query**: We'll reuse what we can.
**Chris.query**: That's going to have to be really a.
**Chris.query**: Probably a field decision based off of what we can reuse where the racking lays out.
**Chris.query**: I mean, we're going to try to reuse everything that we can.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Well, currently, the way it's set up, so the distribution panels are on the north side of the building, and each row is on one circuit.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: So it feeds all the way across the building on one circuit.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: So the issue is, if you take it out, you've got your receiving and shipping docks that are still fed from those circuits.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: So I don't know, you want to leave those and then cap them off where you take the fixtures down and feed the shipping and receiving docs off of that circuit and then put a new circuit in for the.
**Chris.query**: Yeah, I mean, if we can reuse.
**Chris.query**: If we throw a junction and reuse it, then we will.
**Acannon**: Okay.
**Chris.query**: Like, those are too spaced out for what your racking is, right.
**Chris.query**: Chris, any.
**Chris.query**: Anything else you need for us to provide clarity on for the lighting?
**Hermes.rodriguez**: No, I think I'm good.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Just, you know, as long as we get that correct scope of work.
**Chris.query**: Yeah, I said we'll revise it to match the specs so that you guys are clear on that.
**Acannon**: I got it.
**Acannon**: Yeah, go ahead.
**William.twickler**: Yeah, I want to add something else that way, you know, about it.
**William.twickler**: If we award the project to you guys and also say would be a different GC to do the remaining of the work, for instance, there have to be some coordination about the electrical design because of course, I'm adding infrastructure, I'm adding offices, I'm adding a lot of stuff in there.
**William.twickler**: So they have to get a coordination about which panels they're going to use.
**William.twickler**: So just to be aware.
**Chris.query**: Yeah.
**Chris.query**: If you award, you know, one scope to us and another scope to others, obviously you're talking about two different permits, two different designs.
**Chris.query**: Yeah, there would definitely be a lot of coordination.
**Chris.query**: Is that something that you guys are leaning towards?
**Jdawson**: We don't.
**William.twickler**: Honestly, we don't know yet because I don't have any of the other bits.
**William.twickler**: Proposals yet.
**Chris.query**: Yeah, yeah.
**Chris.query**: I mean, obviously we're, you know, we're thinking that we would, you know, do the entire thing because that's going to be the most efficient way to do it.
**Chris.query**: So that's definitely something that it be some coordination because permitting alone is where you're going to run into issues with the city.
**Jremillard**: Andrew got in touch with one of the architects that's pricing it, and it can take you three months to get a permit from the Goodyear unless you got some contacts and expedited.
**Jremillard**: So, you know, and we're looking at three weeks minimum to get the design done.
**Jremillard**: I'm sorry.
**Jremillard**: Go ahead.
**William.twickler**: I would just talk because the city is growing so much and so fast, sometimes it could be a little of a challenge.
**William.twickler**: But, you know, that would be something that we take into consideration to other, like a expediter, at least.
**William.twickler**: I was able to contact someone already from the city.
**William.twickler**: Her name is Lucy Rodriguez.
**William.twickler**: And I think I have.
**William.twickler**: Someone is looking for me who's one of the, you know, senior managers or in the office.
**William.twickler**: So I'm trying to get some contact to see if they can help us out, too.
**Chris.query**: Yeah, yeah.
**Chris.query**: We, again, plan on getting in there and pushing, Meeting with the building officials to see what we can do to push through.
**Chris.query**: And also, you know, fortunately, a lot of this stuff, even when you talk about the warehouse charging, all that stuff, like, there's a lot of things that we'll do before a permit is issued that we can tie in with everything else.
**Chris.query**: I mean, until you have to have an inspection, like an end wall, that's really when.
**Chris.query**: When you're permitting things.
**Chris.query**: So the way that we price this and looked at this is we're.
**Chris.query**: We're going to phase it and say, all right, we're going to get drawings out that are bare minimum to get us a permit, continue to design our detailed set with all the finishes and, you know, finite detail.
**Chris.query**: So we have a construction set.
**Chris.query**: But the biggest thing is expediting that permit as soon as possible to keep you guys rolling so that come September, you know, you have your go live that you need.
**Jdawson**: Hey, so I did find the information on the elevations for the racking.
**Jdawson**: So the selective racking, the top of the upper level beam will be 408 inches.
**Jdawson**: The plan would be to put pellets that are no higher than 4ft up there.
**Jdawson**: So you're at 456 inches in the selective racking.
**Jdawson**: In a.
**Jdawson**: Worst case, when there's material in that upper location.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so 38ft and then you're 37 with the case racking.
**Jdawson**: They were not.
**Jdawson**: I mean, they could extend above that.
**Jdawson**: But as a rule, based on the location, size, I don't think we'll extend above the top of the beam based on the way it's configured.
**Chris.query**: Okay, so, yeah, you're talking 37, 38.
**Chris.query**: So, yep, we, we projected 36.
**Chris.query**: So we're right in, right in there where we need to be.
**Chris.query**: It's.
**Acannon**: Okay.
**Chris.query**: So, yeah, one thing too.
**Chris.query**: So, so now we've gone through the lighting.
**Chris.query**: Are you guys interested in, in this load sharing, battery stuff to eliminate chargers or are you guys setting that?
**Hermes.rodriguez**: I think we'd be open to that.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Take a look at it.
**Jdawson**: You know, my initial answer is yeah, it's worth looking at, but there's going to have to be a valid business case to move forward with it.
**Jdawson**: So if you can help us understand the solution and you know, what you see as potential, you know, ROI on this, then, you know, we can take the conversation from there.
**Chris.query**: Yeah, so I'll let Jesse dive into the details a little bit.
**Chris.query**: But as far as the business case goes, the numbers just on a construction standpoint, you know, we're looking that we could save at least a half a million on electrical just by, you know, adjusting the amount of chargers.
**Chris.query**: And then, you know, as far as on the mhe side of things, based off of this, you should be able to reduce your total number of forklifts by 25 to 50%.
**Chris.query**: I can't necessarily quantify that.
**Chris.query**: I don't know how much you guys are paying for lease or purchase, but I imagine that would be a savings on that.
**Jdawson**: So help me understand that a little bit more.
**Jdawson**: How do you see being able to get rid of those?
**Jdawson**: I mean, they're all going to be needed for peak operations.
**Jremillard**: So, so, and I can just, I can share this.
**Acannon**: I mean, I think, hey, correct me if I'm wrong, Jared, but all the forklifts require operation.
**Acannon**: The reason we went to lithium ion is to get extended charging from them.
**Acannon**: And so it's not that we're going to be swapping, you know, swapping batteries on a, you know, to keep, keep them running throughout the day.
**Acannon**: It doesn't mean that, I don't know, we just need to see what this is.
**Acannon**: But I mean, all the forklifts are required for operation that we have.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: So.
**Chris.query**: Yeah, you're saying that yet they all have to be running at the same time.
**Chris.query**: Are you running a 24 hour shift during peak?
**Jdawson**: No.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Right now all the calculations are based on 16 to eight hour shifts, seven days.
**Acannon**: Yeah.
**Chris.query**: You're charging everything during downtime?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Chris.query**: Okay.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Yes, well, not just during downtime, but so they're going to be opportunity chargers.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: So they'll charge them during breaks and launches and things like that as well.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: That's when they're going to charge Them probably the most gotcha during that time.
**Chris.query**: Okay, Jesse, you want to go through some of these specs with these guys.
**Jremillard**: I can show you a video.
**Jremillard**: Just you can like, see what this thing looks like.
**Jremillard**: So it has like, this is a, a robotic arm that actually swaps the battery out.
**Jremillard**: The lift operator just pulls up here, puts it in park, puts park brake on, and the whole process takes less than three minutes.
**Jremillard**: And this thing, you know, it's got all the cameras on it.
**Jremillard**: It scans the piece of equipment, knows the battery that goes in there, yanks it out, puts it into this rack that, you know, the racks that's constantly charging these batteries, and swaps it out with the fully charged one.
**Jremillard**: They fully, you know, you know, the batteries are all connected by the Bluetooth or whatever, so they monitor the charge that's in all the batteries and all the units all the time.
**Jremillard**: So it only, it recalls them lifts when the battery's down, you know, when it's getting too low, and then it'll have them come over and swap the battery out.
**Jremillard**: So the lifts will be used like, you know, at all times until they're ready to get, you know, the battery swapped out of it.
**Chris.query**: So one of the biggest things with this is the, the saving of power.
**Chris.query**: Right?
**Chris.query**: Using this now?
**Jremillard**: Yeah, they were looking at it.
**Jremillard**: They had an electrical engineer on there, and he looked at, you know, all the equipment that you have listed on your, you know, mhe drawing, and he said it would take over 4,000amps just to power that up their charging stage.
**Jremillard**: So they would have four racks of the battery chargers that three to four.
**Jremillard**: They, they didn't know for sure.
**Jremillard**: So that would only then they take like each of these racks requires 250amp service.
**Jremillard**: So they're saying like all of your equipment there that they could charge.
**Jremillard**: I think they mentioned, like the wire guide systems would be.
**Jremillard**: The only thing that they wouldn't swap a battery out on would be fed by a total of a thousand amps.
**Acannon**: How much, how much power?
**Acannon**: How much, how many amps do we think we're requiring right now for battery for, for the charging?
**Acannon**: Do, do you guys have an idea?
**Chris.query**: You mean with your current layout?
**Acannon**: Yes.
**Chris.query**: Jesse, what is that around they thought it was.
**Jremillard**: Oh, they said just the pickers would be 2,000amps, and they figured 4,000amps for everything.
**Acannon**: When you say everything, you mean for all charging or for the 126.
**Jremillard**: Charging stations?
**Acannon**: For the 126, was it going to be 2,000 or 4,000?
**Jremillard**: 4,000.
**Jdawson**: So right now, I think with the current counts, there's like 99 that have to be on a 25amp breaker.
**Jdawson**: The VNAs have to be on a 35amp breaker.
**Jdawson**: And then the tuggers and the, and pellet jacks and rider pellet jacks.
**Jdawson**: There's 14 between the two at 15amps.
**Jdawson**: So I don't think that gets.
**Jdawson**: Even though you're looking at the, the size of the breaker, I don't think that gets us to 4,000, does it?
**Jremillard**: I was just, it was a quick meeting with them and they threw that number out.
**Jremillard**: Now, I know unlike the, you know, the qualifications that ask for all of them to be 35amp, you know, we, we just, you know, put on our list, you know, the lower voltages.
**Jdawson**: But yeah, and I think with the revised, you know, when we, I think that may have been the case when we were initially looking at young Heinrich, and I think we've settled on Raymond, so the requirements shouldn't be that high is sort of my point.
**Jdawson**: I don't think we're near 4,000amps.
**Acannon**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: I don't, I don't know if it matters, but like, you know, for.
**Jremillard**: If you're getting the new units and they're not here in time and you have, you know, rentals coming in beforehand, they said also, like, you have this battery system and they can run them in any lift there is.
**Jremillard**: They said they've tested them in all the different lifts.
**Jremillard**: So I know there was concern about, like, lead acid battery lifts.
**Jremillard**: And they say they can convert, you know, their batteries or somehow convert and be used and even a lift that uses lead acid batteries.
**Jremillard**: So.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, and that's no longer a concern either.
**Jdawson**: We're currently at, I think there's availability for everything that we would need at this point in time.
**Jdawson**: And once again, going back, just looking at the breakers, I, you know, adding all that up for the 126, I see 3,000, 140.
**Jdawson**: Just based on the.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, based on the breaker.
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Chris.query**: And.
**Chris.query**: And again, this is by no means are we going to sit here and act like we are mhe experts.
**Chris.query**: When we look at any project.
**Chris.query**: We don't just say, oh, well, we're going to do bricks and sticks.
**Chris.query**: Like, our job, as far as I see it, this company sees it, is to make you, as the owner, successful and as profitable as possible.
**Chris.query**: And so this is just a way that we were looking at.
**Chris.query**: All right.
**Chris.query**: How can we solve their issue?
**Chris.query**: You know, and this is a, an option.
**Chris.query**: Right.
**Chris.query**: Maybe it's not feasible.
**Chris.query**: Right.
**Chris.query**: As things Change.
**Chris.query**: But we want to make sure we put it in front of you.
**Jdawson**: Well, yeah, and I, my opinion is, you know, with the overall scope of work for the building, if we run into a problem, we're going to have to add service.
**Jdawson**: You know, maybe the cost of this might, the cost of that activity and adding that additional service, maybe that pushes us towards something like this.
**Jdawson**: So, you know, I don't know if there's, you know, what that does, that number does to the overall calculation as to whether or not we need a new service.
**Jdawson**: But if, you know, y' all can give us some insight on that, that would be helpful in a determination as to whether or not we further you dissect this and look at it as an option.
**Chris.query**: Yeah, we can.
**Chris.query**: Knowing those, those that, that information with the updated requirements, we can plug that in and see what that does to your current capacity versus what you need is.
**Jremillard**: Do you Chris, like.
**Jremillard**: And one other thing, like I don't know if you do you purchase the lifts and the, the batteries, do you lease them?
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: Release because they offer the option instead of buying their system, they'll lease it to you as well.
**Jremillard**: And that's where they, you know, if you're buying all these batteries versus the cost of this, you know, their system, if you purchased it outright, it would between they just rough figure between 1 million and 2 million.
**Jremillard**: We all, we think we can save a half a million on the electrical costs of wiring up all those things.
**Jremillard**: You know, you don't have to purchase or rent a charger.
**Jremillard**: You wouldn't have to rent or purchase a battery.
**Jremillard**: And that becomes part of the system.
**Jremillard**: So you know, that cost savings, you know, they've, you know, have this brochure I sent.
**Jremillard**: They, you know, they're claiming it change.
**Jremillard**: You know, it saves an efficiency.
**Jremillard**: You know, if you look at the warehouse space, you know, you don't have to have these big areas blocked out for charging stations either because these lifts can be put anywhere in the warehouse because they're, you know, they don't have to get hooked up to a charger at any point.
**Chris.query**: So you know, and like, like we said we'll, we'll look at again with see what the loading does.
**Chris.query**: Right.
**Chris.query**: That's something that we're going to engineer out.
**Chris.query**: And then also we're looking at, let's say that, you know, it is close or something like that.
**Chris.query**: What can we do load sharing wise to try to distribute some of that load for the charger.
**Chris.query**: So again, we'll fine tune some of this.
**Chris.query**: We just wanted to Put this on your radar.
**Acannon**: We can discuss it internally.
**Acannon**: I think, you know, here's the issue.
**Acannon**: This project has so many twists and turns to it.
**Acannon**: You know, I'm, you know, this is not a known thing for us and you know, that, that's kind of where the, like, the immediate concern would be.
**Acannon**: I mean, again, I think we have the details here from you guys.
**Acannon**: We can talk about it offline, you guys can study it a little bit more based on what, what Chris is suggesting.
**Acannon**: And then we can, we can, you know, maybe tomorrow we can give you some feedback, you know, in a follow up note or in a, you know, if we're going to have a secondary call.
**Chris.query**: Yeah, certainly, like I said, we'll, we'll, we'll get, you know, updates on all the electrical and again, maybe it's, maybe we can squeeze out what you have there.
**Chris.query**: We're just constantly looking at options.
**Acannon**: Yep.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Okay, cool.
**Acannon**: So want to handle, so, so going back to the first part of our conversation, how do we want to handle this for tomorrow?
**Acannon**: Are you guys going to put all this detail in a note to us in the morning or do we want to have a follow up call along with that?
**Chris.query**: Or I mean, the lighting or.
**Acannon**: Yeah, for the lighting.
**Acannon**: So we are rapidly trying to get to a decision here and we're trying to be very comfortable with your details.
**Acannon**: We, you know, if you guys weren't, if we weren't like very serious about you right now, we wouldn't be spending this time kind of like, you know, going through it.
**Acannon**: So hopefully that shows you the seriousness that we have here.
**Chris.query**: Totally, totally agree.
**Chris.query**: So, yeah, so we'll go back, we'll get everything updated and sent out and you know, we should, should be able to have you something tomorrow in writing.
**Chris.query**: We can follow up the call if you like, you know, whatever questions, but I think we have the gist of it and we'll send it out and obviously if you need something else or you want clarity, we're happy to jump on a phone call.
**Acannon**: Okay.
**Acannon**: Yeah, I mean, is this something.
**Acannon**: Could, could we put a target out there of the, you know, trying to get this done by lunch tomorrow?
**Acannon**: Is that fair?
**Chris.query**: Jesse?
**Jremillard**: Yeah, let me, we'll put that as the target.
**Jremillard**: I need to make some calls after our meeting here and, and then we'll let you know if that is good or not good.
**Jremillard**: But we'll plan on it by noon.
**Acannon**: Yeah, we.
**Acannon**: Again, Jesse, everything we can do here just because time is not in our favor right now.
**Chris.query**: Oh, yeah, Bill, what are we looking at?
**Chris.query**: You know, I know Hermes said that, which I, I didn't realize you guys didn't have other numbers in.
**Chris.query**: What are we looking at as far as release for the entire package?
**Chris.query**: The, the entire base plus the lighting.
**Acannon**: So, so think about it this way.
**Acannon**: We're, we're.
**Acannon**: Our, our plan is just to release the lighting immediately.
**Acannon**: I mean, I think part of this is, you know, again, dependent upon, you know, what you guys share back with us and our comfort level.
**Acannon**: The second I would say on the remainder, it would be later next week.
**Acannon**: But we don't want to hold and wait on, you know, we don't want to wait and hold on.
**Acannon**: On that.
**Acannon**: If, if that makes sense.
**Acannon**: We, we need to get the lighting moving.
**Jremillard**: So are you wanting us to only try and submit for permit on the lights then?
**Jremillard**: Because we don't start that immediately.
**Jremillard**: Right?
**Jremillard**: You know, the same.
**Chris.query**: I mean, we'll, we'll start, we'll, we'll start that.
**Chris.query**: But I mean, I don't think we should submit just based off the lighting if you guys haven't picked on, on the base.
**Chris.query**: Because my fear, Bill, honestly, if we do that and then let's say you come back and like Hermes, like, oh, we're going with ABC Builders, not Alito now.
**Chris.query**: It's trying to get a mess to get two permits and everything.
**Chris.query**: Like, I, I would hate to constrict you.
**Chris.query**: I would say we, you know, if you release this, we get the lights ordered and move forward and get everything going.
**Chris.query**: Because I mean, realistically, we're going to start working there before we have a permit.
**Chris.query**: And you know, it's.
**Chris.query**: If it does go, you know, another way for whatever reason, then we'll just have to figure out how do we work through that and transfer that and find a, a line of delineation or something like that to somehow get two different permits on it.
**Chris.query**: Ideally, I think that, you know, we can work through to figure out what works for the budget via it around and get this thing moving so that we don't have to deal with that constraint.
**Acannon**: Understood.
**Acannon**: Sorry, don't take my silences.
**Acannon**: I'm just trying to think about this.
**Acannon**: How soon?
**Acannon**: Let me ask you this.
**Acannon**: Let's say we awarded you this and tomorrow.
**Acannon**: Let's just say tomorrow because we need to get this information.
**Acannon**: How soon would you be trying to submit for a permit.
**Chris.query**: For the entire project?
**Acannon**: For the lighting?
**Chris.query**: I mean, for the lighting.
**Chris.query**: You know, you.
**Chris.query**: It's, it's tied to the, to the base thing.
**Chris.query**: Because in reality, let's say that if we had the whole project, we Would order the lighting, start getting all that stuff installed, you know, get our drawings submitted, you know, in July in for permit start framing.
**Chris.query**: And then our first inspection that we have, they're going to come in and as soon as that permits them check all that and they're going to come in and see, you know, 30, 40, 50% of the lighting done because we don't have to have a rough in and then a final.
**Chris.query**: Because you can see it all.
**Acannon**: Understood that.
**Acannon**: So, so, so let me ask.
**Acannon**: So I'm trying to, I'm trying to ask this question this way.
**Acannon**: If we awarded you this, but then it took another week to decide if you were going to get the whole package or not, would.
**Acannon**: So that we could.
**Acannon**: What, what would that do for permitting?
**Acannon**: Would you be trying to submit a permit specifically for lighting next week or would it be later than that?
**Chris.query**: So we wouldn't be submitting a permitting, a permit just for the lighting, like say you release tomorrow.
**Chris.query**: We wouldn't.
**Chris.query**: Like, that wouldn't make sense.
**Chris.query**: Because if we did that and let's say you went with somebody else.
**Acannon**: Yep.
**Chris.query**: It would cause an issue.
**Chris.query**: So I like us waiting a week to see what you decide on does not kill you on the production of the lighting in the warehouse.
**Acannon**: That's kind of my question.
**Chris.query**: No, we would, we would keep moving forward.
**Chris.query**: At the end of the day, like, we are supremely confident in, in what we bring.
**Chris.query**: Like, you know, we're really the cheapest, always the best.
**Chris.query**: Like, that is what we preach and that is what we live by.
**Chris.query**: So, like, we're going to keep moving, assuming that the, like, we're going to do the entire thing and get you taken care of.
**Chris.query**: Because at the end of the day, what I care about is you being operational in September.
**Chris.query**: And so we're going to keep moving and if it changes, we'll figure it out.
**Acannon**: Yeah, so in Chris or Jared, please, guys, jump in here.
**Acannon**: But the.
**Acannon**: My question is we would not be holding up anything if it took us another, you know, the balance of next week to make a decision on the bigger picture.
**Acannon**: Is that a fair statement with regard if we released lighting, we would not be interfering with that.
**Acannon**: Now this building already has, you know, we're getting ready to go in and do all these upfits.
**Acannon**: But the building already has, you know, an occupancy for the building.
**Acannon**: So it's not as though the building.
**Jdawson**: Is.
**Acannon**: Does not have certain elements already in it and it's not already under an occupancy.
**Acannon**: So I mean, right now what we, what we're not sure about.
**Acannon**: And, you know, you're answering the question a certain way is if we have specific scope and we issue a permit, you know, could you have two different permits or is it going to require one permit?
**Acannon**: It's not as though this building is in initial construction.
**Acannon**: So I don't know.
**Acannon**: Just trying to.
**Chris.query**: Yeah.
**Acannon**: Through that, if that makes sense.
**Chris.query**: Yeah.
**Chris.query**: And so typically, and I'm not saying this is like, we've worked through it different times, but when you start to pull multiple general building permits on the same building, that's when municipalities start to be like, no, I can't have multiple of general building permits on the same building.
**Chris.query**: That's where they start to.
**Chris.query**: To start to ask questions and start to get like, nope, we don't do that.
**Chris.query**: Now, again, we've worked through it on.
**Chris.query**: On different times, said, well, here we're going to break this up and this up, and here's a timeline.
**Chris.query**: But that is, that is a grace, not a rule.
**Chris.query**: And so I want to be clear about that.
**Chris.query**: Like, I'm not saying it can't be done, but I also don't want you to say, like, oh, we can definitely do this, because I cannot guarantee that.
**Acannon**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Acannon**: Let's just keep moving this as fast as we can.
**Acannon**: We.
**Acannon**: We understand some of the.
**Acannon**: The key points that you're calling out, and it is something that we have had, you know, some discussion on.
**Chris.query**: Gotcha.
**Chris.query**: But yes.
**Chris.query**: So we'll.
**Chris.query**: We'll get this revised and sit to you guys and, and to answer your question, like, understanding what it takes for you guys to be operational with the lighting and trying to get a hold of the racking, like, you know, we're going to keep moving.
**Chris.query**: If you have to take, you know, the first week, you know, July or whatever to.
**Chris.query**: To decide on that, then that's fine.
**Chris.query**: My.
**Chris.query**: My one request for you would be like, hey, if.
**Chris.query**: If there's something you need us to adjust on the base proposal to make this thing work, then let's talk through that.
**Acannon**: Okay, let me ask this question, Jared.
**Acannon**: Have we provided.
**Acannon**: It seems like we maybe have.
**Acannon**: I know that we made this change with Raymond.
**Acannon**: Does Brandon and them have those new figures?
**Acannon**: And maybe it's not important at this stage, but the new figures on the charging.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I thought we reviewed the current requirements for the chargers that Jordan and Christian had provided, but maybe we did not.
**Jdawson**: But nonetheless, I can send the updated drawing I've got by vehicle or mhe type.
**Jdawson**: I have the breakers broken out on the power distribution plan, so you can take a look at that.
**Jdawson**: And I think that'll give you, you know, it'll be apples to apples in terms of what I'm looking at, what you're looking at.
**Jdawson**: But I did, I did change it last, towards the end of last week.
**Jdawson**: So we'll certainly get that out to you today.
**Jdawson**: I'll put it in the Dropbox, the new drawing.
**Chris.query**: Perfect.
**Chris.query**: Appreciate that.
**Acannon**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: And when you guys are looking at.
**Jremillard**: Or Chris, you're looking at it, you know, and I just looked at the one line drawing.
**Jremillard**: The existing drawings, if they're correct, you know, they've got, you know, there's two 3000amp services.
**Jremillard**: One has an 800amp and a 200amp panel coming off of it, and the other one has just a 200amp panel off of that.
**Jremillard**: Like is the correct way to figure it is that we have 4800amps available to use or is there less than that for everything we're adding?
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Well, we got to figure out what the lighting's going to draw.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: And, and I notice here on, on this sheet here, it shows current power available, but then you got current charging design, which I think that's equal to what current chargers are now.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: That 3140.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, I changed it when you said that.
**Jdawson**: Okay, but, but here's the thing.
**Acannon**: We have, you know, we have full access to all the, all the power that is available in the building is our power.
**Acannon**: So granted, the offices are already wired to an extent.
**Acannon**: They are taking up X amount of power.
**Acannon**: There's already a little bit lighting, there's various things like that, all that power, you know, all of the two 3000amp services are available for this project.
**Acannon**: It's just what is already in use in the building versus what is available and needs additional panels and so forth.
**Acannon**: Does that make sense?
**Jremillard**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jremillard**: That's why I just don't know, like if we got, you know, the ac, the additional ac, all the other office lighting, there's some other charging, some other things.
**Jremillard**: The, like all the dock equipment, I don't know how much that totals up to.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: So going to be pushing at 6000amp service.
**Chris.query**: Yeah, definitely.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I think, I think no matter what.
**Chris.query**: Whether it's the battery changer or load sharing, there's something we're going to have to do to lower the usage.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I think some of the panels that are already in the building, like, you know, one of them is fitting a charging area that Home Depot had set up for mhe.
**Jdawson**: I mean that stuff is going to be used for charging mhes where it's at today.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: So those panels can either be, you know, reused, moved, you know, whatever I think an office area is going to go or an extension to the office area or break room will go where those panels are today.
**Jdawson**: And all the infrastructure that's on the floor is going to have to come out.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: So you, I think you have a lot more available than 4800.
**Jdawson**: Just based on how some of that is, is currently distributed and set up in the building right now, a lot of it's not going to be needed.
**Chris.query**: So, you know, would it be safe.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: To say currently there's 2,400amps in the building available?
**Hermes.rodriguez**: There's three.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: There's three 800amp panels in the building, but we can add up to five more, but we have to bring them in from the switch gear.
**Chris.query**: So, yeah, we'll.
**Chris.query**: We'll base it off of the, the, you know, because you've got two 3000amp transformers feeding, you know, is it, is it, it's two 3000amp MDPs, correct?
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Yes.
**Chris.query**: Yeah.
**Chris.query**: So, so we'll, we'll base it off of 6,000 and then just redistribute appropriately based off of the new design requirements.
**Chris.query**: Does that sound accurate?
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Yes.
**Chris.query**: Okay, so that, that's the, that's the position we'll take.
**Chris.query**: We'll kind of forget and just act like we're going to, you know, rewire and assume that, hey, we've got 6,000amps.
**Chris.query**: You know, we're going to use whatever 5,600 of it.
**Chris.query**: You know, you got 400 left and we're going to use all 6,000.
**Chris.query**: But we'll, we'll say, hey, we are going to be right at the wire, you know, or we're going to have a little bit extra.
**Chris.query**: Or, hey, we're going to have to figure out how to shed 200.
**Acannon**: Yeah, I mean, the bottom line is we, there is no way we can add more service to the building.
**Chris.query**: And.
**Acannon**: You know, like, like we're saying it's almost like the existing panels.
**Acannon**: We need to see what is active and what's not.
**Acannon**: So Home Depot is not, you know, they had charging in there.
**Acannon**: Those chargers are gone.
**Acannon**: I'm assuming they're gone.
**Acannon**: We're not using them.
**Acannon**: And so all those circuits are available, you know, within the building as they exist today.
**Acannon**: Versus I have to bring.
**Acannon**: Chris, tell me if you disagree.
**Acannon**: Versus I have to bring all new circuits in for everything that we're going to, to put in this.
**Acannon**: If there's some circuits there that are unused, they can be used.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Right, Yeah.
**Jremillard**: And one thing before I forget, like for us to expedite our design, have we got some CAD drawings like the existing space plan?
**Jremillard**: Well, the space plan or like the, you know, is there any of the original.
**Jremillard**: We got the PDFs of the as built.
**Jremillard**: But does anyone have access to the CAD files of those?
**Jremillard**: Because if we were doing the full build out, that would be.
**Jremillard**: That would be a big time saver for whoever designer we would bring on.
**Jdawson**: I have not seen any.
**Jdawson**: I mean we have some CAD drawings with building, but you know, if you get into the PDFs, the structural, the architectural drawings, I've noticed seen the CADS for those, if that's what you're looking for.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: Is that something Hermes, maybe you can.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I think it would be the best point of contact for sure.
**Jdawson**: I think the other call out, you know, in terms of the drawing, you know, we've settled on dock equipment that was identified on the layout, but the power requirements were.
**Jdawson**: Weren't not there.
**Jdawson**: They may not have been on the copy that you got, but I believe they were at least the dock location, the dock pit levelers, communication lights, dock locks or dock restraints, that's all added there.
**Jdawson**: And I.
**Jdawson**: And if you look on the layout tab, the power is spelled out for, for those as well based on the spec sheets.
**Jdawson**: So I'll put that in the box here in a little bit.
**Chris.query**: Okay, awesome.
**Jremillard**: And that, you'll put the, that'll be a CAD file too.
**Chris.query**: I will give you, I'll give you.
**Jdawson**: The CAD file in, in the, the Dropbox.
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Hey Jared, are we gonna, are we gonna relocate those six big ass fans and then add additional fans on the docks?
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Because I just hope will work anywhere.
**Jdawson**: So those are on the layout on the, on the.
**Jdawson**: I believe on the power distribution I show removing those and relocating.
**Jdawson**: And then, you know, I currently have a total of 35, you know, but you know, 30 new and then five that would be reused.
**Jdawson**: You know, we're looking at that as our, you know, cooling solution for the site.
**Jdawson**: And so we're getting pricing for those today.
**Jdawson**: So there is power requirement for the 35 that will be in place as shown on the drawing.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Okay, but that includes the big ass fans as well?
**Jdawson**: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.
**Jdawson**: That's what I'm referencing.
**Jdawson**: I think we.
**Jdawson**: It's a 483 phase 10amp circuit I think is what the requirement was.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: But then the 30 fans that are currently on the docks, because we want to locate those.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Those are also on the drawing on the distribution.
**Jdawson**: It Shows where they're at and it spells out which dock doors we need to relocate them to.
**Jdawson**: And then there are going to be 31 new fan packages that will be installed on the remainder of the dock doors that we'll be using for the operation.
**Jdawson**: And those are also spelled out.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: So was that in your quote, Brandon?
**Hermes.rodriguez**: For the electrical for those?
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: And there's 61 dot clocks.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Jremillard**: So those are.
**Jremillard**: And those.
**Jremillard**: What, what's the amperage on them?
**Jdawson**: Let me look.
**Jdawson**: My computer moves at the speed of mud.
**Chris.query**: It's usually how it works.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, lucky me.
**Jdawson**: I'm flying.
**Jdawson**: And you know, it's horrible because I'm trying to go and update like the, the rolls and the, and the bay numbering on the layout and.
**Jdawson**: Oh, that's been a long process.
**Jdawson**: Okay, that's not the right tab.
**Jdawson**: Sorry.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so the dock locks, where are you?
**Jdawson**: Oh, I put that on the layout tab.
**Jdawson**: Sorry.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so the restraints 120, 20amp circuit.
**Jdawson**: I think you can share multiple packages on one circuit.
**Jdawson**: See 3.1 FLA per restraint system.
**Jdawson**: And then the turbo fans, the new fans, 3.3amps.
**Jdawson**: So that's for the 31.
**Jdawson**: And then the existing fans that would need to be relocated, the FLA is 4.8amps on those.
**Jdawson**: So that's all spelled out on the layout tab.
**Jdawson**: So you'll get that in a minute.
**Jdawson**: And.
**Jremillard**: If we were matching the existing, why would that be different?
**Jdawson**: I wonder for which ones.
**Jremillard**: For the fan light combo.
**Jdawson**: Well, so the, the trailer fan light combo for what's there already has a higher rating and the ones that were specced out are different manufacturer, different brand, you know, all that good stuff.
**Jdawson**: So it's two different manufacturers fan models and the current requirements are different.
**Jdawson**: So that's, I think that answer, I think that's why to answer your question.
**Jremillard**: And then Bill mentioned some conveying systems.
**Jremillard**: Like do you have a overall idea of how much that all is going to require?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, there's two panels.
**Jdawson**: They're spelled out on the power distribution and they are.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: 60Amplays.
**Jdawson**: No, they're 200amp.
**Jdawson**: They're going to feed all the, the flex conveyor and the air compressor is all going to be fed out of that panel.
**Jdawson**: So it'll be 483 phase 200amps.
**Jdawson**: And there's two compare systems.
**Chris.query**: Two 200amp 42.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, 480 volt, three phase 200amp circuits.
**Jdawson**: And then I think the other major thing that probably wasn't on what you initially received and it's.
**Jdawson**: I Don't know.
**Jdawson**: It's not really major.
**Jdawson**: But they're in the MDF room.
**Jdawson**: That's on the drawing.
**Jdawson**: It's on the northwest side of the building.
**Jdawson**: They're going to have a split AC unit in there.
**Jdawson**: And you know, that's a two way, one phase, 25amp circuit.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: We would probably want that to be redone, wouldn't we, Jarrett?
**Hermes.rodriguez**: We probably want two units.
**Jdawson**: You know, I mean, honestly, they didn't.
**Jdawson**: I don't think I spelled it out one way or the other, but that would make sense.
**Jdawson**: Especially given the ambient temperature in Arizona.
**Jdawson**: Right?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: I would bump that up to two because of Burnville.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: That's what we did.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: We put two.
**Jdawson**: Did you?
**Jdawson**: So.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: All right.
**Chris.query**: I will modify that.
**Jremillard**: And we just did a guess like that.
**Jremillard**: We're adding a 25 ton RTU for each of the new office break room spaces.
**Jdawson**: I am not 100% on that.
**Jdawson**: I've.
**Jdawson**: I didn't know how they sized them.
**Jdawson**: But if someone from our side gave you that, then that would.
**Jdawson**: Sure, that's.
**Chris.query**: Yeah.
**Chris.query**: I mean, I.
**Chris.query**: I think we would definitely, you know, as we get into design, I mean, we'll do an actual load calculation based off of this many bodies.
**Chris.query**: You know, what kind of temperature we want to achieve based off of what's inside.
**Chris.query**: But I.
**Chris.query**: I think, yes, you're correct.
**Chris.query**: Is, you know, it was just.
**Chris.query**: Let's put something there to get a benchmark that we.
**Chris.query**: We believe will cover it.
**Chris.query**: So that's how the 25 tons came out.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that's fine.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So I will save this and send it your way.
**Jremillard**: All right.
**Jremillard**: Sounds good.
**Chris.query**: Perfect.
**Chris.query**: We'll get to work and then.
**Chris.query**: Yeah, Chris will get you everything.
**Chris.query**: And if there's any other questions or anything you need, just feel free to reach out.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Sounds good.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Thanks, guys.
**Jdawson**: Have a good.
**Jdawson**: Have a good day.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Take care.
**Jdawson**: Bye.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Sam.
**Hermes.rodriguez**: Sa.
