## Transcript
**Bclymer**: Sam.
**Jdawson**: Hey, Brandon.
**Bclymer**: Hey, Cabot, you there?
**Bclymer**: I can't see you.
**Jdawson**: Oh, my camera is.
**Jdawson**: Hold on.
**Jdawson**: I need to turn off AutoCAD.
**Bclymer**: And down.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Kmass**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: I'm gonna go join Jesse in the other room.
**Bclymer**: All right, Sam, you're muted.
**Kmass**: There we go.
**Kmass**: All right.
**Kmass**: So, Keba, welcome.
**Jdawson**: Thank you.
**Kmass**: Go through this here again.
**Kmass**: We just had lunch, but yes, seems like you're doing well.
**Kmass**: Everything's going well.
**Kmass**: So first one on here was, do you feel you're being compensated appropriately?
**Kmass**: He said yes.
**Kmass**: So, I mean, you just started too, so.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Kmass**: Just getting going.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Kmass**: Have you made any costly mistakes?
**Kmass**: If so, what were they?
**Kmass**: He said no.
**Kmass**: Again, we're just getting started.
**Kmass**: And, you know, we.
**Kmass**: The costly mistakes, you know, we.
**Kmass**: We do, like, want everyone to maximize their bonus.
**Kmass**: So, you know, it's important that, you know, we tell all the supers they need to make sure they're communicating with the project managers, go over the budget, go over the scopes of work.
**Kmass**: Because them asking someone to do something that's in someone else's scope or, you know, not managing the subs like those change orders and back charges that we can't get rid of, they, you know, that's what costs jobs and creeps into the profit, or it allows job to have a better profit than expected.
**Kmass**: And that's where we can maximize the bonuses we can give out.
**Kmass**: But being cognizant, you know, when you do make a mistake and you remember it, you don't make it again.
**Kmass**: So.
**Kmass**: So we encourage everyone to do.
**Kmass**: Have you done things above and beyond your position to save, make the company money?
**Kmass**: If so, what are they?
**Kmass**: Search for lower cost material sources to increase profit.
**Kmass**: So, I mean, that's a good thing to do.
**Kmass**: But again, as a pm, like, that's really your, you know, your job is to, you know, buy jobs out, get things done.
**Kmass**: So, you know, we keeps popping up.
**Kmass**: You know, we're more looking like, what do you do?
**Kmass**: You know, if you go and read your.
**Kmass**: Maybe read the project manager job description.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Kmass**: Things you're supposed to be doing.
**Kmass**: So like, those are just standard things the PM does.
**Kmass**: So when you think of things over and above, it would be, you know, is it, you know, new checklists or procedures or ways to get more bids or ways, you know, ways to be more efficient.
**Kmass**: Those are things like when you think of anything you can do that is a better practice or a new way to do things that helps everyone out, those are the things we're always looking for.
**Kmass**: And that's works into promotions and everything else.
**Kmass**: People that are taking the lead on that.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I mean, you know, increasing profit and finding different sources of material, that's, that's expected.
**Bclymer**: So I mean that's, you know, if, if that was extra, then what do we pay you for?
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Kmass**: Yep.
**Kmass**: And things are doing well.
**Kmass**: One thing I do think that goes above and be, you know, you know, the ability that you have with CAD and you know, helping out with the radio, Avon, doing those drawings for them and you know, being efficient at it because if it took you all day long and you couldn't do anything else but draw, then you wouldn't be doing your p.
**Kmass**: So it's, it's good that you're good at it.
**Kmass**: And like those drawings help them make their mind up.
**Kmass**: You know, they went from wanting a full mock up build or something to, you know, looking at the drawing you did and they can make a decision.
**Kmass**: So it's definitely helpful.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I mean I think one thing is you, you know, you, you seem to have a pretty good work ethic.
**Bclymer**: You know, I know that you just need to, you know, come in early, stay late, like now.
**Bclymer**: You know, I think your efficiency probably is not where it should be.
**Bclymer**: But you know, you're making up for that with working hard, which is always appreciative.
**Kmass**: Yeah.
**Kmass**: And you know, we can look at some things like getting things just done and out the door.
**Kmass**: You know, sometimes we think too much almost on certain things and instead of just making a decision and go.
**Kmass**: But I do appreciate you here every morning.
**Kmass**: Usually you're here before me, which I.
**Kmass**: That's good.
**Kmass**: Where can you improve?
**Kmass**: Be more proficient in job planner and scheduling.
**Kmass**: So you know that, you know, the job planner.
**Kmass**: I don't know how to use everything in it.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Kmass**: You know, something that just takes time and learning how the thing works.
**Kmass**: So that's good scheduling.
**Kmass**: You know, as you work with different superintendents, you know, they'll help you see how the sequence of job goes.
**Kmass**: And by being involved in making sure you're looking at the schedule updates that the super is putting out.
**Kmass**: And it's just something you learn over time.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Kmass**: Of building and different jobs are different.
**Kmass**: So.
**Kmass**: But just having confidence like, like Brandt made a note is just, you know, if you're confident you can do something and you just proceed with like I'm going to figure this out.
**Kmass**: It's not more than I can handle.
**Kmass**: Like that confidence will help you become more proficient in those things too.
**Kmass**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I mean when you, when you talk about successful project managers or anybody.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: It's problem Solving critical thinking, that is the real skill, because there's all kinds of things that, you know, new technologies, new systems that come out in construction, and we would be fools, you know, to think that we know it all.
**Bclymer**: However, I have confidence in myself, Jesse, many of us, that no matter what comes down, we can find a way to do it, right?
**Bclymer**: We will do the research, we will figure it out, we will learn it and find a way to do it.
**Bclymer**: And that's the confidence piece that I'm talking about, is having the confidence in yourself to know that.
**Bclymer**: All right, Even if I've never done this before, I know that I'm going to leave no rock unturned, and I'm going to get this thing done and.
**Bclymer**: And be proficient.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Bclymer**: I think some of it, it seems like, is, you know, again, I.
**Bclymer**: It just.
**Bclymer**: You get unsure of yourself.
**Bclymer**: Is that.
**Bclymer**: Is that accurate in.
**Jdawson**: Sometimes?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: But I mean, I like when it comes to Job Planner, so I'm usually pretty good at, like, treating myself.
**Jdawson**: These programs, I try to do the same with Job Planner.
**Jdawson**: They don't have anything, especially on YouTube.
**Jdawson**: I guess they have.
**Bclymer**: They have training videos on YouTube.
**Jdawson**: When I check, they have like, two, three, three.
**Kmass**: Their website.
**Bclymer**: Email.
**Bclymer**: Email, email support.
**Bclymer**: Ask them for a link.
**Bclymer**: They have a bunch of videos.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: What I was doing is I was looking at training videos on Proco, which they had a lot on YouTube.
**Jdawson**: So I was trying to transfer knowledge from.
**Jdawson**: From that.
**Jdawson**: So I'm trying to figure it out.
**Jdawson**: But, yeah, that's a good idea.
**Jdawson**: I can reach out to them and ask.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, they have.
**Bclymer**: They have training videos.
**Bclymer**: Um, so, yeah, I mean, it's not just.
**Bclymer**: Again, I don't know Job planner that well, you know, Right.
**Bclymer**: Like, I know how to build, though.
**Bclymer**: Like, I can figure it out.
**Bclymer**: I'll ask support.
**Bclymer**: I'll do whatever.
**Bclymer**: But, you know, just in general, right?
**Bclymer**: Like, you know, for you to grow.
**Bclymer**: I mean, part of that, you know, confidence also is going to be with knowing something, right?
**Bclymer**: Like knowing the job like the back of your hand, knowing where materials are at and submittals and, like, just knowing, right.
**Bclymer**: Like, where you're like, if I come and ask you a question or Jesse comes ask you a question, you just know it.
**Bclymer**: If I'm like, hey, man, you know, how many panels are we adding at Uniqlo?
**Bclymer**: You know, like, three, you know, one 480 and two, two 120s.
**Bclymer**: Like, okay, great.
**Bclymer**: Like, that's huge, right?
**Bclymer**: That's not hard for you to know.
**Bclymer**: You've gone through those submittals.
**Bclymer**: You should know that.
**Bclymer**: Right, right.
**Kmass**: The next one, what do you like your manager does?
**Kmass**: Communication, guidance and training.
**Kmass**: The next one, where can your manager improve more?
**Kmass**: Training session.
**Kmass**: Training sessions.
**Kmass**: Just ask and elaborate.
**Kmass**: Like what kind of topics?
**Kmass**: Like what would you.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I think most of these was about job planner.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: But I, I did after this, I did talk, I did have a session with AJ and we went through a lot of the, the processes and procedures.
**Bclymer**: Well, and use Nick too.
**Bclymer**: I mean he's very well versed in it.
**Bclymer**: Like you know, use, use those resources.
**Bclymer**: It doesn't always have to be Jesse and I.
**Bclymer**: Right, right.
**Bclymer**: Like there's, there's a whole company of people that are good at different things and you can use those different resources and again, like, you know, particular job plan.
**Bclymer**: Like I know they, I have some training videos.
**Bclymer**: Like you just email them, ask them, you know, ask the question.
**Bclymer**: That's, that's part of the thing is you got to ask the question.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah, you're.
**Jdawson**: I think Nick actually has been really helpful.
**Kmass**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: It's, yeah, he's the next thing.
**Jdawson**: I just step in and ask him.
**Kmass**: Questions and just like it's Good you're using YouTube.
**Kmass**: Like you can self teach yourself a lot of things by just looking it up on the Internet and gaining more knowledge on different topics.
**Kmass**: So but that's something like, you know, we're probably, you know, we need to start doing some more company meetings where we just get together and review certain, certain things and how we do them just to refresh everybody and get everyone talking to each other.
**Kmass**: So something we'll work on.
**Kmass**: Where do you want to be in 5 years?
**Kmass**: High level management position.
**Kmass**: So you know, on this subject, you know, we get varied responses but really you'd want to like our first goal should be to be if we're a PM or we're a super, we're going to be the best or the most qualified PM there is or the best superintendent there is.
**Kmass**: Because like if you want to move on and manage other PMs or the supers, if you're not the best at it or you know, have got everything figured out right.
**Kmass**: Like how do you move on to the next position?
**Kmass**: So our first goal should always be like, I want to be the best PM and then learn, you know, as I learn all the other phases of construction and the estimating and the, you know, the field and schedules and all those things, then all right, now we're ready to be managing like whole departments.
**Kmass**: But we had to, you know, master our own, master our own craft Craft.
**Kmass**: That's the word first.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I mean, Kevin, you're a assistant project manager, and so to say you want to be an operations manager in five years, that's a, you know, that's a very, very tall order.
**Bclymer**: Like, you know, you got to think like, you're going to be here for a year, you know, and Uniqlo will just be getting done, right.
**Bclymer**: So, you know, you've got that project, you know, maybe you run one more, you know, then you're looking at, you know, ideally, if you can show that you can run, you know, a project essentially, you know, the full way through without me or Jesse holding your hand, you know, or somebody else.
**Bclymer**: And that's going to tell us, okay, now he can, he can be a project manager, right?
**Bclymer**: And then you've got to, you know, run some jobs and get, you know, get good at project management.
**Bclymer**: I mean, if you were an operations manager, you know.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: You know, and you're in charge of $200 million in work, you know, like, I mean, can you say that you have enough knowledge to manage that in five years?
**Bclymer**: Probably not.
**Bclymer**: You know, that's like, I mean, you gotta think pro.
**Bclymer**: Big enough projects like that wouldn't even be done before that time frame.
**Bclymer**: So, you know, like, like Jesse said, like, focus on, like, I'm going to be the very best at what I am right now, you know, and then just step up like that, that will come.
**Bclymer**: But you have to look right now and say, I'm going to be the very best.
**Bclymer**: Because if you sit there and just think like, oh, well, in five years I want to be up here, like, you're just going to let yourself down.
**Bclymer**: It's okay to have dreams and aspirations, but one of those should be, I'm going to be the very best at what I do right now, today.
**Jdawson**: Makes sense.
**Kmass**: Yeah.
**Kmass**: See?
**Kmass**: How can I help you get there?
**Kmass**: Present opportunities on our challenges to get me there.
**Kmass**: So definitely, like, and again, me and Brandon are both same way.
**Kmass**: And it's with everybody is like, if, if you have everything handled, you're given now, because right now you've got Uniqlo and radial Avon and radial Amex.
**Kmass**: Like, could you come to us today and say, I'm bored because I don't have anything to do.
**Kmass**: I got everything covered.
**Kmass**: All my submittals are done, all my subcontracts are bought out.
**Kmass**: You know, the superintendent's got everything he needs on that job site.
**Kmass**: Everything's scopes covered, materials are on the way.
**Kmass**: Like, then, like, you know, when you can show, like, Hey, I can knock these things out or the three jobs isn't too much, then yeah, we'll definitely give you more, more work and more things to cover.
**Kmass**: Because we for sure we got too much going on right now that we can, you know, we're trying to cover a lot of things that typically would be handed off to a PM or estimator.
**Kmass**: So I mean, we want everyone to, to get there.
**Kmass**: But like, when you get to that point, then definitely let us know, like, hey, I've got this handled, you know, but we don't want to overwork people or give them too much and then they fail and, or, you know, all of the jobs suffer.
**Kmass**: And, you know, those are the things that end up costing us more and causing more problems.
**Bclymer**: The only thing worse than messing up one job is messing up multiple jobs.
**Bclymer**: So until you have that, like, you know, like uniquely like I get in there, Procurement log's not up to date.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Our biggest scope sprinkler.
**Bclymer**: I don't see it on there.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Like, I can't give you anything else.
**Bclymer**: Like, you know, that's a, a great project.
**Bclymer**: That's, you know, infrastructure.
**Bclymer**: That's a high margin job.
**Bclymer**: Like, you know, it's not complex.
**Bclymer**: Like, that thing should be perfect.
**Kmass**: Is there a reason we don't have that?
**Jdawson**: Well, we were waiting on the final approval for the submittals.
**Jdawson**: So yesterday and this morning we, we got.
**Jdawson**: Yesterday we had.
**Bclymer**: Kevin, I'm gonna, I'm gonna try to stay calm right now.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, write this down.
**Bclymer**: I will, I will get you this book.
**Bclymer**: I want you to read it.
**Bclymer**: It's called Extreme Ownership.
**Jdawson**: Extreme Ownership.
**Bclymer**: Extreme Ownership by Jocko Loe.
**Bclymer**: Because what you're doing right now is pushing blame and saying, oh, well, we were waiting on this, this and this.
**Bclymer**: Like, no, you could have that.
**Bclymer**: You don't even have the list on there.
**Bclymer**: You could have.
**Bclymer**: We know all the components.
**Bclymer**: You know, when do we need it on site?
**Bclymer**: What's the lead time?
**Bclymer**: That is it like you need to take ownership and say it's not done because I didn't get it done.
**Bclymer**: It's not anything to do with the submittal process or anything like that.
**Bclymer**: Like, that log can be done before submittals are approved.
**Jdawson**: True.
**Kmass**: Yeah.
**Kmass**: And that's, you know, it goes back to again, like if you want to be the manager of other people, like, we want people that are going to expect like that submittal should have.
**Kmass**: Smittel log should be done like immediately on a job.
**Kmass**: Like, you should know exactly all the materials you need.
**Kmass**: Relatively almost everything you need should be listed on there as if not for anything but a reminder that you're missing.
**Kmass**: But you should have a schedule for the job already.
**Kmass**: So you put the schedule, you know, when the materials are due.
**Kmass**: You should have talked to all the subs by then to see what the lead times are and then you can back into the date where I need a submittal by this date because I know it's going to take me two weeks to get the thing approved and it's going to take him four weeks to get the material and I need it by now.
**Kmass**: And you want to give yourself a couple week grace period so it's not showing up at the last second.
**Kmass**: Like those have to be done right off the bat.
**Kmass**: Because like when you're doing that and then it's time to have someone be the management over other people.
**Kmass**: We're going to look to you if you're the one that always hammered all that stuff in on your jobs and always had it done.
**Bclymer**: Like, that's one thing.
**Bclymer**: Like, you know, I, I comment about, you know, I don't talk to Nick that much.
**Bclymer**: Well, part of the reason I don't talk to him that much is because when I ask him questions, he's got it.
**Bclymer**: He's either working on it or he's got it.
**Bclymer**: He's got something like handled.
**Bclymer**: And so I'm like, all right, great.
**Bclymer**: I don't have to worry about it.
**Bclymer**: And that's why I can, you know, give all these goodwill jobs to Nick and know that he's going to take care of it and get it done.
**Bclymer**: He might need some guidance on certain things, but he can do 80% of it and allow Jesse and I to go focus on other things.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Kmass**: So that's it.
**Kmass**: We'll present you the opportunities when got everything handled that you got, that you're working on.
**Kmass**: You asked about what's your favorite current AI tool?
**Kmass**: How does it help you?
**Kmass**: So mine is still a calculator, so I'll let Brandon answer this one.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I mean, I usually said I use ChatGPT daily.
**Bclymer**: I have it on my, my home screen, on my phone, you know, literally.
**Bclymer**: I mean, example today I had to go get blood, you know, and I was, I was asking it like, how do I lower my cortisol levels?
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: I have a higher cortisol levels, which is your stress hormone, you know, and I was like, what are things I can do to lower that?
**Bclymer**: You know, just.
**Bclymer**: And it's like, you know, I talked to it and it's like, here, you want me to give you a plan of daily things you can do to try to help lower that.
**Bclymer**: You know, I, I use it literally all the time.
**Bclymer**: Calculations, like if, if there's checklists that I want to, you know, fill out that I'm not sure of, you know, I'll toss a, you know, drawings in there, schedule, ask it questions about that and have it help me.
**Bclymer**: You know, it's, it's really just a great sounding board that I use for anything.
**Bclymer**: And there's a ton of AIs out there.
**Bclymer**: I wish that I had more time to just go and explore them and see how, you know, we could utilize them more and more in business.
**Bclymer**: Unfortunately, I don't have that luxury right now.
**Jdawson**: You said that you, you were able to put in drawings.
**Jdawson**: Do you put them in a JPEG form or PDF or.
**Jdawson**: It can take anything.
**Bclymer**: It just depends.
**Bclymer**: I mean, it can read, it can read all the files.
**Bclymer**: It just depends on the size of the file, Right?
**Bclymer**: So if you, if you, if you drop in, you know, a full sheet, set of sheets, like it's going to be too big of a file.
**Bclymer**: And so instead what I will do is if I have a question on certain things, a lot of times I'll take a screenshot and put it in there and use that.
**Bclymer**: I mean, when I'm doing stuff on different programs, for instance, I was messing around one weekend working on creating an AI for Alito.
**Bclymer**: Well, that means I have to use code.
**Bclymer**: So all I did was I created a project in ChatGPT and said, I want to create an Alito AI.
**Bclymer**: Give me the steps.
**Bclymer**: And it would say, all right, do this, this and this.
**Bclymer**: And I would go to the screen, take a screenshot, say, here's what I'm saying.
**Bclymer**: What do I click?
**Bclymer**: You know, and it just gives me step by step.
**Bclymer**: And I do that with tons of stuff.
**Bclymer**: You know, I constantly take a screenshot.
**Bclymer**: I mean, I fixed my, my fridge door at my house the other day because it wasn't ceiling, right?
**Bclymer**: And I'm like, here.
**Bclymer**: And I took a couple pictures.
**Bclymer**: It was like, how do I fix this?
**Bclymer**: And it's like, oh, you know, take this and, you know, lift the door up and screw this, blah, blah.
**Bclymer**: Oh, great fix.
**Kmass**: Now you have like your AI account.
**Kmass**: Is that for everybody?
**Bclymer**: The ChatGPT one?
**Kmass**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yes, everybody has the professional.
**Bclymer**: I'll send you another invite.
**Kmass**: Have you got on?
**Jdawson**: I just asked last week.
**Jdawson**: She sent it to me this, this week.
**Kmass**: So you have it.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Kmass**: I mean, yeah, I have it.
**Kmass**: So.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, everybody has it.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Jdawson**: Great.
**Bclymer**: What other questions do you have?
**Jdawson**: I think that's, that's it for now.
**Jdawson**: Hey, look, I appreciate the feedbacks and I'll make sure I implement all of them.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I mean, you know, again the, you know, we wouldn't tell you anything, you know, we wouldn't put any time into you if we didn't think it was worth it.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Bclymer**: So anything that we tell you, like, hey, this is where you're lacking, this is where you need to improve, it's because we think that you're actually worth it.
**Bclymer**: You know, other, you know, other people don't care as much, don't spend near as much time because we know that it's not worth the investment.
**Bclymer**: Jesse and I, you know, again we're, we both are very hard workers.
**Bclymer**: Like we, we set the standard, you know, we lead by example.
**Bclymer**: And I can tell you one thing, like, you know, that for to move up, like knowledge is going to get there.
**Bclymer**: Like we don't expect everybody to know what we know.
**Bclymer**: Day one.
**Bclymer**: Hard work is something we can't teach.
**Bclymer**: And so by coming in, putting the hours, hard work, like learning, you know, constant never ending improvement.
**Bclymer**: Can I C A N I.
**Bclymer**: And as long as you're getting 1% better each day, imagine how much that's going to add up over a year, five years, right?
**Bclymer**: You're going to be leaps and bounds.
**Bclymer**: I mean even you're driving to work.
**Bclymer**: You know, you can listen to different educational stuff, you know, whether it be audiobooks or you know, some, you know, something about some construction method on YouTube or whatever.
**Bclymer**: But if you're constantly building out your knowledge base, it'll pay huge dividends.
**Bclymer**: And then, you know, when we talk about promoting people, you know, a big thing that Jesse and I look for are guys like us that are going to set the standard.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Because Jesse and I, you know, we don't want to be the first in and the last out all the time.
**Bclymer**: And frankly we shouldn't have to be.
**Bclymer**: We own the company.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Like we need other people to set up and set that standard.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: And that's what we look for.
**Jdawson**: Got it.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I agree with just, even just getting exposure to new things.
**Jdawson**: I have not really worked on fire sprinklers to this detail before and also electrical.
**Jdawson**: So the more I'm getting exposed to, the more I'm actually I'm learning.
**Jdawson**: So every day is some new improvements.
**Kmass**: That's like things that, you know, I learn a lot by submittal review.
**Kmass**: So like you force them to get you the submittals and then you.
**Kmass**: You're comparing the material they're submitting with what's on the drawings.
**Kmass**: And that'll help you understand, like, okay, I understand.
**Kmass**: This is this panel and these are the breaker sizes and everything matches.
**Kmass**: Same thing with the sprinkler pipe.
**Kmass**: And, you know, they got all the parts and pieces.
**Kmass**: And that's where you learn it, you know, is one way, you know, like Brandon said, there's all kinds of YouTube videos and everything.
**Kmass**: Just look up whatever sprinkler system we're putting in or the racking systems, which, I mean, I still don't know a whole lot about the automatic racking systems.
**Kmass**: I'm learning it.
**Kmass**: But, you know, those things, those are things you can do on your own.
**Kmass**: And then when Brandon asks, you was talking about something, and if he hears you chime in and talk, you know, educated about whatever system that you're actually putting in, then he's like, well, here's something.
**Kmass**: Okay, I stopped worrying about this.
**Kmass**: I got people working for me that know what they're doing and know what they're putting in.
**Kmass**: So those are all things you can do.
**Kmass**: And I don't know how your other company was, but there's a lot of companies, like, we're running this company just like the Laytons and the Brassfield and Gories and like the big companies, like, these are the processes they have this, you know, worked for them.
**Kmass**: I know, like, what those are.
**Kmass**: So, you know, if some of these things are new and simply the, like, how things are working, like, we didn't invent this.
**Kmass**: You know, we just used our knowledge from working for other companies and we try to take the most efficient.
**Kmass**: Sometimes they do things that aren't efficient, don't make sense.
**Kmass**: But the ones that are efficient and create success on a job, those are the ones we implement.
**Kmass**: So, you know, it's.
**Kmass**: I tried to write up all the, you know, policies and procedures and, you know, should get into that to just try and cover all the bases.
**Kmass**: But, you know, if you have access to those, which you should.
**Kmass**: I don't know if you've seen them.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, he gets them in his welcome email.
**Bclymer**: They all do.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Kmass**: So just read through those and like those, those are steps on what each person does to make a job successful and make sure everything's covered, then if you don't understand some of them, yeah, I'm here.
**Kmass**: Just ask me.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: You know, you can always, like, you're free to innovate.
**Bclymer**: We're not rigid.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Like, we want innovation, you know, so, like, don't be scared to bring new ideas.
**Bclymer**: And hey, I made this checklist because this seems to happen or like something.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Like you can do things like that and it's appreciative because chances are if it's helpful for you, it's probably helpful for other people.
**Jdawson**: Right?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So don't, don't get stuck in the.
**Bclymer**: In that.
**Bclymer**: That.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: I mean again, feel free to innovate.
**Bclymer**: Think outside the box.
**Jdawson**: Sounds good.
**Jdawson**: I was speaking to Ahmed this morning.
**Jdawson**: So he, this is by Unico.
**Jdawson**: He wanted us to.
**Jdawson**: To write our change order for the panels and the new transformers and whatever the cost would be for any delay.
**Jdawson**: And he wants us to.
**Jdawson**: I think they, he said they're discussing it if.
**Jdawson**: I think they agreed that we should be sending the exchange order to Exotech instead of.
**Bclymer**: I mean it's not.
**Kmass**: Well, we don't have a contract with Exotech so.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, we don't send our change orders to Exotech.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: They can, they can figure out what they want to do.
**Bclymer**: Like you know, they can do deductive.
**Kmass**: Change order from their contract with Exotech, but.
**Jdawson**: Gotcha.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Kmass**: Yeah.
**Kmass**: Do we have all that pricing with Tim?
**Jdawson**: We do have both pricing and there's CS02 that Joseph was saying was missing.
**Jdawson**: So he sent me information on that and I just forwarded it to.
**Jdawson**: To Tim and he's going to add.
**Kmass**: That to the pricing for what, what was missing?
**Jdawson**: It's.
**Jdawson**: It's one of their systems.
**Jdawson**: I think they have CS01, 2 and 3.
**Jdawson**: And he said on the drawing, the latest drawing that they sent us on one of the transformers at the bottom was missing.
**Jdawson**: So he said we needed to add that and sent it to Tim yesterday.
**Jdawson**: He said he doesn't know how big that is.
**Jdawson**: So I spoke with Joseph this morning and he sent it to me.
**Jdawson**: I forwarded it to Temp.
**Jdawson**: His hadn't that surprising.
**Bclymer**: So one thing that just like is when people just constantly forward emails like that's just paper pushing.
**Bclymer**: So like take the five minutes to read it and craft a new email to the sub or whoever it is that you're writing because just getting in a habit of forwarding stuff.
**Bclymer**: A, you're not actually fully reading it and taking it in.
**Bclymer**: B, there's always a chance that whoever you're forwarding into just goes around you and then talks directly with a client or whatever or vice versa.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: We want to make sure that, you know, the information is being presented in the way we want it presented.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: And that you're understanding that like, that's like.
**Bclymer**: I've always, like, handwritten contracts instead of copy and paste, just simply so that it's ingrained.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: So it's the same thing with this kind of stuff.
**Bclymer**: I will rewrite, you know, different emails and stuff, you know, if engineer sends instructions, and I will rewrite it in.
**Bclymer**: In my tone, so I understand it, and so I have a conceptual knowledge versus just being like, boom.
**Jdawson**: Got it.
**Kmass**: Okay, well, we need to review that.
**Kmass**: Yeah, get that change order ready, but we need to get that out because they've been asking for that since last Friday.
**Kmass**: I thought we were first turning that in.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, we need to get that in today before the meeting.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Get it in today.
**Bclymer**: That way they have time to review it and whatnot, because the moment that we keep dragging our feet, then they're not gonna.
**Bclymer**: You.
**Bclymer**: They're going to start telling us that it's our fault because we're delaying it.
**Jdawson**: All right, let me go talk to Tim and have you finalized and send it.
**Kmass**: Yeah, just don't plug a number in there.
**Kmass**: You should know they just price the million square foot warehouse in an hour for us, so.
**Jdawson**: Right, right.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Took Brennan to help out.
**Kmass**: Yeah.
**Kmass**: Tell Tim you're gonna have to call Brandon and get him to help out if he can't get that to you.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: Okay, thank you.
**Kmass**: All right, deal.
**Bclymer**: Okay, Scott, thank you.
