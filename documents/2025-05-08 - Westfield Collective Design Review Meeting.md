## Transcript
**Bclymer**: Is Jeff okay?
**Bclymer**: Jeff's on here.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: All right, we'll get the structural stuff out of the way real quick here.
**Bclymer**: Jerrica just returned to the AG Pierce submittal.
**Bclymer**: So those guys are good to go.
**Bclymer**: Jerrica, we had a mezzanine reinforcement plan for the second floor.
**Bclymer**: And then did you see what I was talking about with the cut sheets?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, so I had a question about that one.
**Jdawson**: I have the RFI open if that's helpful, but we're referencing a different sheet.
**Jdawson**: S 501, not 500.
**Jdawson**: So I think that we're.
**Jdawson**: We're okay in that respect, but we can talk further offline if we need to.
**Bclymer**: As far as like those ones that I cut out, you see, you were calling out two on S501.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And the snipers of S500.
**Bclymer**: Okay, I see, I see, I see.
**Bclymer**: I messed up that.
**Nbigler**: Huh.
**Nbigler**: And then Glenn, I.
**Nbigler**: Jerrica sent me the question about the insulation.
**Nbigler**: So minimum insulation for first slab and what's listed in the com check.
**Nbigler**: So it's R12.
**Nbigler**: That is two feet below finished.
**Nbigler**: The finished slab.
**Nbigler**: So essentially a two foot strip.
**Nbigler**: R12 should be a two inch ISO.
**Nbigler**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah, we went, we, we figured that and went ahead and went, Went, went for that.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: Okay, we are good.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so cut sheets are good.
**Bclymer**: Mezzanine reinforcement plan.
**Bclymer**: Jerk.
**Bclymer**: And we talked about that.
**Bclymer**: Are you, are you working on that or.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we're working on that one.
**Bclymer**: Okay, cool.
**Bclymer**: Brings us to Nick.
**Bclymer**: So we discussed doing the joist depths.
**Bclymer**: He said that he can get the.
**Bclymer**: So the joy steps right now, Jeff, are going to be 26 inches everywhere.
**Bclymer**: They could get those areas down to 20 inches in those bays.
**Bclymer**: But there have been added costs.
**Bclymer**: So we'd like to propose doing eight foot doors and putting like a storefront above it, like a header.
**Bclymer**: So we just essentially put a storefront in there that matches these mullions.
**Bclymer**: Or it'd be an eight foot door.
**Bclymer**: So it'd pretty much take this whole.
**Nbigler**: This whole top panel there.
**Nbigler**: Yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: So that would be a storefront to match this.
**Bclymer**: So we wouldn't have.
**Bclymer**: We shouldn't have an issue with the pud.
**Bclymer**: Rather than taking this out, we don't want to get rid of this garage door.
**Bclymer**: We talked about putting a storefront in or making this like a fixed door so it doesn't open.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: So we don't have an issue with the PUD part of it.
**Bclymer**: But they do want to keep the garage doors if we can.
**Bclymer**: So going to an eight foot door, we won't have to adjust any of the joists.
**Nbigler**: Yeah.
**Nbigler**: I think the only problem with that is.
**Nbigler**: Right.
**Nbigler**: So that's a fairly wide opening.
**Nbigler**: So like what you'd have to frame in there like Jericho.
**Nbigler**: I don't know from a.
**Nbigler**: I mean that's a 12 foot wide opening.
**Nbigler**: I mean, how big would the box header from a exterior stud have to be?
**Nbigler**: I mean, by the time you get the box header in there above the door, you're essentially going to be left with nothing for storefront.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I don't have a good feel for the size that it would need to.
**Nbigler**: Be, but I mean, it's probably at least eight, if not deeper than that.
**Jdawson**: Probably.
**Jdawson**: It's a wide opening.
**Nbigler**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: An eight inch wide header.
**Nbigler**: Eight inch tall.
**Nbigler**: Yeah.
**Nbigler**: So at least eight, but it could be more than that.
**Nbigler**: Right.
**Nbigler**: So by the time you're left, you're left with, you know, a 12 to 14 inch piece of glass and 5, 5 of that is taken up by the frame.
**Nbigler**: So that just doesn't seem very.
**Nbigler**: It just seems like kind of a.
**Nbigler**: A, a waste by the time you get all that in to have this tiny little strip.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: We're just trying to think of how to make sure that the PUD doesn't have an issue with us changing this, you know, and not get to.
**Bclymer**: Not get rid of the doors completely.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Nbigler**: Yeah.
**Nbigler**: Has, has that been brought up with as.
**Nbigler**: I mean, you're right.
**Nbigler**: I hate to go back to them and ask the question for fear of what the answer is, but I mean, it might be something where we have to go back and talk to them about doing it.
**Nbigler**: Like on this side.
**Nbigler**: I don't think it matters.
**Nbigler**: Right here you lower it to eight.
**Nbigler**: It.
**Nbigler**: I mean, it doesn't, I don't think it, it affects the design at all.
**Nbigler**: I mean, I'd argue that it doesn't on the north as well.
**Nbigler**: We just enlarged that portion of the EFIs kind of accent piece.
**Nbigler**: Just make that deeper.
**Bclymer**: Wait on the north of the south.
**Nbigler**: I'm sorry, on the, on the south.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I mean, and that's.
**Bclymer**: That would be the other option if as you know, that was, that was our initial option.
**Bclymer**: But then, you know, trying to appease the PUD ahead of time, we kind of thought to ask that question.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Nbigler**: I mean, do you want me to reach out to Ryan and just propose it and see what he thinks?
**Bclymer**: Is that your contact with.
**Bclymer**: At the PD or.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, somebody.
**Bclymer**: Okay, yeah, that would help.
**Awoodhams**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: See what kind of, see what kind of guidance because, you know, we could also, I mean, we haven't asked the question about eliminating these as garage doors, but there is an option to just make them a fixed door or a storefront that.
**Bclymer**: That makes it look the same, and they're just not functional doors.
**Nbigler**: Yeah, I guess have.
**Nbigler**: What's the owner's preference?
**Nbigler**: Right.
**Nbigler**: Because I can.
**Nbigler**: I can have and see which.
**Nbigler**: What was it.
**Nbigler**: Sorry.
**Bclymer**: To have the doors to keep the.
**Nbigler**: Have the garage doors.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Awoodhams**: Okay.
**Nbigler**: So that would be.
**Nbigler**: Option one would be keep the garage doors, lower them to eight, increase that ES panel.
**Nbigler**: And if they're like.
**Nbigler**: No, the opening has to, say, the exact same size.
**Nbigler**: It can't shrink.
**Nbigler**: Then option two would be turning it into storefront.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Nbigler**: Or.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Or just a.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, a fixed door.
**Bclymer**: So it still has the same look because they had the, you know, 1, 2, 3, 4 doors across the front.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Nbigler**: Oh, you're saying leave it as a garage door in.
**Nbigler**: In construction, but it just doesn't open.
**Bclymer**: Correct.
**Nbigler**: Gotcha.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So, I mean, I don't.
**Bclymer**: I don't foresee them being that stringent on us about it, but.
**Nbigler**: Yeah.
**Awoodhams**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: But I don't know.
**Bclymer**: And the other thing.
**Bclymer**: And we talked, and Nick had some implications with this.
**Bclymer**: If we continue this masonry that has implication with the steel and then obviously, the grade beam that we didn't put there for that masonry.
**Nbigler**: Mm.
**Bclymer**: So at this point, we're pretty far along to back this up.
**Bclymer**: What do we think about just taking the wood here and making the exterior of all that some wood?
**Bclymer**: Both bathrooms are wood or wood.
**Nbigler**: I mean, I think that that's at least consistent with.
**Nbigler**: With what we're showing.
**Nbigler**: Right.
**Nbigler**: So obviously.
**Nbigler**: So in that case, then we wouldn't need a grade beam.
**Nbigler**: We still would need to pour a small section of foundation wall, but it's just metal studs on top of it.
**Nbigler**: It's.
**Nbigler**: It's.
**Nbigler**: It's not bearing the weight of stone.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Awoodhams**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right, so let's plan.
**Bclymer**: Let's plan for that.
**Bclymer**: For that bathroom.
**Bclymer**: Do you have the bathroom layout?
**Nbigler**: Yeah.
**Nbigler**: Do we.
**Nbigler**: Do we want to take a look at them?
**Bclymer**: Yes, please.
**Awoodhams**: All right.
**Nbigler**: So essentially have two options.
**Nbigler**: So this would be the first option.
**Nbigler**: And obviously ignore that this is block, because.
**Nbigler**: Yeah.
**Nbigler**: So the first option is two completely separate.
**Nbigler**: So men's and women's with two fixtures a piece, single sink.
**Nbigler**: So these openings would obviously both be new.
**Nbigler**: And then based on the size, we can't get the double door to this side of the beam.
**Nbigler**: So it would have to go to the other side of that column.
**Nbigler**: In reality, I would probably propose, if we have to move it, we just move it over to the center.
**Nbigler**: Because if we look at the actual first floor construction for that area, right.
**Nbigler**: It would.
**Nbigler**: It would line up so that it's actually in between the two courts equally.
**Nbigler**: So that, that feels more logical as far as, like it being at the corner of one of the courts.
**Nbigler**: Right.
**Nbigler**: So if this is your.
**Nbigler**: Your extra space for it to just line up there, if we're going to have to move it regardless.
**Nbigler**: Right.
**Nbigler**: So this is option one.
**Nbigler**: You get two fixtures a piece.
**Nbigler**: Option two is less fixtures, but the difference here is it's less square footage.
**Nbigler**: You're getting a single on each side, a single unisex on each side, but you keep the existing door opening where it's at and don't move it.
**Nbigler**: And then essentially you make this kind of like a vestibule.
**Nbigler**: And this is just another.
**Nbigler**: This is just a hollow metal, full white door set that goes to the outside.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Nbigler**: The other thing you could do is if you didn't, you wouldn't.
**Nbigler**: Because of the.
**Nbigler**: Let's see.
**Nbigler**: Trying to think of the square footage.
**Nbigler**: I think we still need these doors regardless.
**Nbigler**: I'd have to double check.
**Nbigler**: We may be able to just get rid of these doors and just leave the opening.
**Nbigler**: But the thought here was we don't create another opening.
**Nbigler**: We don't modify the steel framing for this opening.
**Nbigler**: That's already in VP's model.
**Nbigler**: But you just.
**Gdesmit**: That's just the girt.
**Bclymer**: It's okay to, to change these at this point.
**Awoodhams**: Okay.
**Nbigler**: So I don't know if you want me to put these both on a quick 11 by 17 and I can send them over to you guys and you guys can review with the owner group.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah, that's perfect.
**Bclymer**: We'll do that.
**Bclymer**: Do it that way.
**Nbigler**: I tried to fit.
**Nbigler**: If we, if, if we wanted to get two unisex on each side, we don't have the width to come out to here, so it would have to.
**Nbigler**: It would have to pop out farther.
**Nbigler**: So I didn't do that as an, as an option.
**Bclymer**: The two unisex bathrooms.
**Nbigler**: So what I was looking at was if, if I got four unisex ones in, I couldn't do that with this wall aligned.
**Nbigler**: It wouldn't fit.
**Nbigler**: Or the other option was I was trying to get two unisex on this side and not do this portion over here at all.
**Nbigler**: Right.
**Nbigler**: Just have like an extra corridor that would go back to it.
**Nbigler**: But we didn't have enough space north to south.
**Bclymer**: Either way, even if we shifted the, shifted the door, we wouldn't have enough north to south room.
**Nbigler**: No, we don't have enough space north to south to get to side by side.
**Nbigler**: So I don't know if there's a.
**Nbigler**: The other thing that I would just be.
**Nbigler**: It would just go to the bottom of the mezzanine.
**Awoodhams**: Okay.
**Nbigler**: Yeah.
**Nbigler**: So we would just.
**Nbigler**: We'd have to show a new detail where we essentially spray foam the bottom of the mezzanine in this area above the ceiling, and then we'd drop an act ceiling in.
**Nbigler**: In.
**Nbigler**: In here as well.
**Ashton**: Sounds good to me.
**Nbigler**: Glenn.
**Nbigler**: The other one that I looked at but it wouldn't work was we had talked about trying to keep this opening and essentially do like a little, you know, vestibule area and then go to each side, and we just don't have enough room.
**Nbigler**: The.
**Nbigler**: The most efficient way to do it because we're doing wall mount or wall hung toilets, is to keep these back to back as opposed to having them here and here.
**Nbigler**: And we just.
**Nbigler**: We were kind of running out of room with that door anyway, so.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Without looking too deep into the plans, Micah, would that.
**Bclymer**: I mean, would we.
**Bclymer**: Would we be able to tie into one of the sanitary lines from here and go under these footers and tie in to the sanitary line that's on the south line, south of the building?
**Bclymer**: Is that elevation.
**Bclymer**: I mean, is that drop going to be.
**Bclymer**: Is that going to line up?
**Bclymer**: Would this lateral over to the other bathroom?
**Gdesmit**: I mean, I.
**Gdesmit**: I don't know of hand.
**Gdesmit**: I mean.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Gdesmit**: I mean, we can set the.
**Gdesmit**: We said the depth we come in out there, I think almost as deep as we want.
**Gdesmit**: It kind of depends on the best routing.
**Gdesmit**: Is it good to go all the way across the beach volleyball court and tie in outside the building, or is it better to, you know, turn it somehow and come into the kitchen area and tie in?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So I'm curious about, because we have, you know, 18 inches of sand on.
**Bclymer**: On, you know, the south side of this wall here.
**Bclymer**: A sanitary line under there.
**Bclymer**: I guess I gotta check.
**Bclymer**: We'd have to check the invert on.
**Gdesmit**: What it is deep.
**Gdesmit**: We're gonna.
**Gdesmit**: How deep we set it or where we set it on the far side of the building.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Gdesmit**: But yeah, there's 18 inches there.
**Gdesmit**: I mean, we got to be that deep no matter what.
**Bclymer**: Right?
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Gdesmit**: So we're gonna be.
**Gdesmit**: We'd probably be below the other pipes than to start with.
**Gdesmit**: So it almost might be better to coordinate going straight across the same volleyball court and tying in where we come into the building.
**Gdesmit**: Almost just making sure it's deep enough.
**Bclymer**: It's.
**Bclymer**: So the sanitary invert where the grease trap is at 900 and the top of slabs at 904.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: So we'll be able to get deep enough.
**Nbigler**: All right, well, I.
**Nbigler**: Glenn, I will get both these on an 11 by 17 and sent over to you here this afternoon so you guys can talk to the owner group.
**Bclymer**: Perfect.
**Bclymer**: All right, we talked about those.
**Bclymer**: As far as this goes, obviously, we're.
**Bclymer**: Like I said, we're getting ready to get concrete in the ground here soon, so just need to kind of get pricing from you guys on the design fee and get the change order out to the owner so we can keep.
**Bclymer**: Keep them moving.
**Bclymer**: So we'll get your decision back on the bathroom as soon as we can, Jeff.
**Bclymer**: Last thing, I guess, is the air curtains I have.
**Bclymer**: Those are missing from the architectural and the electrical plans.
**Bclymer**: So these air curtains that we're putting over all the garage door openings, now that we're changing the height, we'll do the.
**Bclymer**: I believe we're going to go with the eight foot door.
**Bclymer**: That's pretty much the only option at this point.
**Bclymer**: Do we have room for these to fit, Jeff?
**Bclymer**: Do we have.
**Nbigler**: I.
**Nbigler**: That's.
**Nbigler**: It's the first time I've heard of the air curtains being mentioned.
**Bclymer**: Really.
**Nbigler**: I mean, from a H VAC standpoint, and because they're not primary entrances and exits, you don't.
**Nbigler**: I mean, Micah, correct me if I'm wrong, you don't technically need them.
**Gdesmit**: No, I think they probably just want them for.
**Gdesmit**: In the middle of summer to kind of make a bug.
**Gdesmit**: Yeah, a bug zone and a comfort zone to keep.
**Nbigler**: Correct.
**Gdesmit**: The hot air out and the bugs out.
**Nbigler**: Yep, yep.
**Nbigler**: No, I.
**Nbigler**: I completely understand that, but.
**Nbigler**: Yeah, Glenn, this is the first time that I'm hearing that anybody's brought it up as far as I'm aware.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Nbigler**: So I think we'd have to look at that again from a section, if there's a spec for one that you guys have looked at.
**Nbigler**: And then we got to compare that against the new opening height plus the clearance for it and the garage door.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I.
**Bclymer**: I can't imagine it's more than the two feet that we're going to have, but I don't know.
**Bclymer**: Freaking garage door.
**Bclymer**: 16 inches that we didn't think of.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Nbigler**: Yeah, yeah.
**Nbigler**: Well, yeah, I mean, if it's.
**Nbigler**: If we're lowing it, if we're lowering it to eight.
**Nbigler**: Right.
**Nbigler**: So we're essentially getting.
**Bclymer**: The top, the above, the top of the joist or the Bottom of the joist will be 10ft at that point.
**Nbigler**: Yeah.
**Nbigler**: So you really only have six, six, six inches of clearance above there.
**Nbigler**: Right.
**Nbigler**: Depending on where you put it.
**Nbigler**: Right.
**Nbigler**: You could put it far enough in that it's not directly above the coil, the actual spring coil.
**Nbigler**: Right.
**Nbigler**: Because I know that that's what's taking up the space kind of directly attached to the outside wall.
**Nbigler**: So if it was, you know, a foot, you know, back beyond that, then you get a little bit more clearance because then you just have to clear the track which isn't as high.
**Nbigler**: But again, we have to see a cut sheet for it so we can kind of compare based on the actual cut sheet from the, from the door.
**Bclymer**: All right, I will.
**Bclymer**: I'll see what Jesse had.
**Ashton**: I would ask David Biddle.
**Ashton**: I mean he's.
**Ashton**: If he has any type of, you know, alternate heights for tracks, I think maybe you can request.
**Ashton**: Have you talked to him about that, Glenn?
**Ashton**: I know he's on vacation and.
**Ashton**: But available in the mornings.
**Ashton**: I talked to him yesterday.
**Ashton**: Just curious if he has anything else as we're continuing the conversation to see if he could do, you know, something that doesn't require that much of a.
**Ashton**: Much of headroom?
**Nbigler**: I don't know.
**Bclymer**: I mean I've been doing research on this ever since it was a 16 inch and I mean I found you can, you can do some type of custom track that I can get like two or three inches out of.
**Bclymer**: But I mean we'd still need a very minimum of 12 inches.
**Bclymer**: Even if, even if we found something like that that would work.
**Nbigler**: Okay.
**Ashton**: So that means nine foot doors would be.
**Ashton**: You could do it if we, if we took the price increase to do 20 inch deep joists.
**Bclymer**: We're not.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I don't.
**Bclymer**: We're not going to do that.
**Ashton**: Okay, gotcha.
**Bclymer**: So no, we're not going to do that at this point.
**Bclymer**: We're going to figure out a way to make these doors work and make it look appropriate.
**Bclymer**: And the last thing was kind of the, the air curtains and it's not, you know, it's not just that to like.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Mounts.
**Bclymer**: It mounts there.
**Bclymer**: So you need to say well if it mounts there we need more clearance.
**Bclymer**: Can we do, you know, just one of those 20 inch joists, you know where it was goes along the wall there on the, on the west wall.
**Bclymer**: So on the north wall or on the south wal.
**Bclymer**: Those are joists are running this way, you know.
**Bclymer**: And this is our door here.
**Bclymer**: We have, we have this, this space up here to use.
**Bclymer**: I don't know what exactly that space is, but we would have that here on this side, but we would not have it here where your joists would be running right along this wall.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right, well, we need to keep working on this further, but as far as everybody else goes, I think we've covered all the other stuff.
**Bclymer**: We know that this bathroom is getting added.
**Bclymer**: We'll get you an answer on which layout we want to do.
**Bclymer**: We can get going on MEPs and get started on that process.
**Bclymer**: Does anybody else have anything else that they need for any questions that they had or anything they're waiting on from?
**Brhoades**: I have a question on the.
**Brhoades**: The FF and E.
**Brhoades**: We don't have power in the floor for any of those booths or anything.
**Brhoades**: I don't know if that's something that is going to be needed.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Brhoades**: How is their FF&E selected?
**Bclymer**: They.
**Bclymer**: They decided this week to go with the architect or the interior design firm that did their Liberty location because they had.
**Bclymer**: They had all the stuff and they bought like, they bought the FF&E and all the design through them directly, I guess.
**Bclymer**: So as far as we've been directed, it's all.
**Bclymer**: It's all post installed stuff, stuff that can be moved.
**Bclymer**: And no, I wasn't given any direction of anything staying permanent or having outlets or anything like that.
**Bclymer**: So Eli is the guy's name.
**Bclymer**: I assume he'll probably get involved in this design here at some point for the.
**Bclymer**: For the finishes.
**Bclymer**: So I will put that on the agenda and give him a question for you for anything that.
**Bclymer**: And then we'll update with the air curtains and the.
**Bclymer**: And the floor boxes, if there are going to be any.
**Brhoades**: Yeah, I only bring it up because of the lights that were on the.
**Brhoades**: The ones in Liberty.
**Brhoades**: Those.
**Brhoades**: Those are like, mounted on the furniture, so power would have to come from below.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I remember seeing that.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: I know what you're talking about.
**Bclymer**: Okay, I will get that question out.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: Anybody else?
**Bclymer**: Cool.
**Bclymer**: Eight minutes early.
**Bclymer**: Thanks, guys.
**Awoodhams**: Yep.
**Awoodhams**: But.
**Ashton**: Thank you.
