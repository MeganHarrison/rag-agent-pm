## Transcript
**Acannon**: Hey, Jesse.
**Jremillard**: Hey, man.
**Jremillard**: I joined in the old one and it got in.
**Acannon**: Oh yeah.
**Acannon**: I.
**Acannon**: I guess I could have started the old one then.
**Acannon**: That might be too easy.
**Acannon**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: I didn't know if you saw it on down in the corner.
**Jremillard**: I never see that.
**Jremillard**: That pops up in the corner for teams.
**Acannon**: Oh, yeah.
**Jremillard**: Do you know what time zone this owner is in?
**Acannon**: They're think Dallas.
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: So it's four o' clock there.
**Acannon**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: I don't know that we're going to get them a budget number by an hour.
**Acannon**: Well, that's.
**Acannon**: We just need to say they're going to get it tonight sometime or what we're thinking.
**Acannon**: That's why I was.
**Acannon**: I'll roll through this with you.
**Acannon**: So we've plugged like 560 for demo and pour back of the docs since we don't have a number back yet with that.
**Acannon**: And we just plug demo for the new entrance concrete.
**Acannon**: Can you share that?
**Acannon**: Yeah, that would help, wouldn't it?
**Jremillard**: Thank you.
**Acannon**: Okay.
**Acannon**: Can you see it?
**Jremillard**: Yep.
**Acannon**: Yeah.
**Acannon**: So we got the demo there.
**Acannon**: Demo.
**Acannon**: The lights, we'll just put.
**Acannon**: Well, no, that's.
**Acannon**: They got all those lights so should be an electric number.
**Acannon**: But let's just say they're gonna spend 40 grand demo those concrete.
**Acannon**: He's got that in his plumbing number and then pour back between the two.
**Acannon**: Should be fine.
**Acannon**: And I just put 35 in there for any missed patching of floors.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: And I should have at least one dock number back by day's end.
**Acannon**: Okay.
**Acannon**: These a pacific time and I just, you know, we get to it.
**Acannon**: I plugged in the dude's number that did get it to us.
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Acannon**: For metals.
**Acannon**: I just figured $200 a square foot and plug the bollards and I just put an extra 45 grand in there for whatever.
**Acannon**: I don't know what you think of that.
**Jremillard**: I think that's pretty fair.
**Jremillard**: What is 931200 to Bollard?
**Jremillard**: Yeah, I think that's pretty fair.
**Acannon**: Yeah.
**Acannon**: This is 3, 4 foot, 200 linear foot.
**Speaker 2**: What kind of bollards are they?
**Speaker 2**: Sounds kind of hot.
**Acannon**: Not as steel bollards, but they're gonna have to go core hole set them.
**Acannon**: I mean the bollards will cost 500 bucks a piece to buy anymore for the material.
**Jremillard**: 200 and I think almost 50 for the poly sleeve.
**Acannon**: Yeah.
**Acannon**: So that's where we just got to get to the end number because we're like 6 million now.
**Acannon**: We just need electrical and H vac plywood.
**Speaker 2**: Do we need the a roofing budget?
**Acannon**: Still I put.
**Acannon**: I just plugged some numbers in.
**Acannon**: So I plugged in buck 50 a foot for the wall and ceiling insulation.
**Acannon**: H vac curves.
**Acannon**: I just put 5,000 a piece.
**Acannon**: Figured on four rooftop units, max plumbing vents.
**Acannon**: They should only go through the roof five times.
**Acannon**: Maybe we have four.
**Acannon**: Some of the back to back bathrooms should be just one vent going up.
**Acannon**: Then walk pads.
**Acannon**: If we circle these units and they're 40ft, go 10 foot around 1 times 4, then I just plug 10 grand for sealants in case we got to touch anything up.
**Acannon**: What do you think about that for the roofing number, Jesse?
**Jremillard**: I think it looks fine.
**Jremillard**: I just want the walk path.
**Jremillard**: Do you think 10 bucks is cheap nowadays?
**Acannon**: Is it?
**Jremillard**: I think it's low a little bit.
**Jremillard**: Maybe safer.
**Acannon**: Right.
**Speaker 2**: Make it certain we all get a bonus.
**Jremillard**: I think that saves for the.
**Jremillard**: I think we're good on the Friday budget Number.
**Jremillard**: Call that I just texted you then, Andrew.
**Speaker 2**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, I think that looks fair.
**Jremillard**: That curb number, is that just for the roofer or is that for the curb?
**Acannon**: Just the roofer.
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: So that curb cost is rolled into the H vac.
**Acannon**: It should be okay.
**Acannon**: Should be.
**Acannon**: And for doors, I just figured between doors and hardware, 1250 a door for the interior.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Acannon**: Is that what you're seeing in Phoenix?
**Jremillard**: I think that's pretty good.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Acannon**: It's tough.
**Acannon**: I'm just plug in guessing.
**Acannon**: There's nine interior storefronts and then four side lights.
**Acannon**: I think they spec them for the offices only.
**Jremillard**: There's aluminum storefront in here.
**Acannon**: The view windows.
**Acannon**: Because like.
**Jremillard**: Oh, those lights.
**Jremillard**: The site.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, the full lights or whatever they are.
**Acannon**: Well, they asked for side lights, I thought.
**Acannon**: But then if you look at.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: The view windows are the big full light.
**Jremillard**: Just the polymetal glass.
**Jremillard**: Right.
**Jremillard**: Or aluminum glass.
**Acannon**: Yeah.
**Acannon**: Like here and here.
**Acannon**: And here's one.
**Acannon**: I don't think they're full height, but they'll be just like a.
**Acannon**: Yeah, up in the wall above the counter here.
**Acannon**: Same thing here.
**Jremillard**: So those right now in Phoenix at least, and I think more of a national level are like 60 to 90 days lead time once you pay for the order.
**Acannon**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: So we'll just want to keep that in mind on those.
**Acannon**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: And I'm putting in storefronts right now down here.
**Jremillard**: So if we need to get a quick number for that, the guy who's picking up all the extras is the one doing it for me on the other job.
**Jremillard**: So.
**Acannon**: Okay.
**Acannon**: Well, this is on the high end of storefront for there.
**Acannon**: So I hope since they're not very big.
**Acannon**: That's should be.
**Acannon**: It's not impact or anything.
**Acannon**: Okay.
**Acannon**: And then finishes.
**Acannon**: So I just threw 250 in there for drywall framing and hanging.
**Acannon**: 75 for finishing paint.
**Acannon**: But then I also have epoxy paint in the bathrooms.
**Acannon**: Acoustic ceiling tile, base flooring.
**Acannon**: It's going to be.
**Acannon**: There's not a whole lot of carpet tile because it's only the offices.
**Acannon**: Everything else is going to be ceiling in there.
**Jremillard**: So.
**Acannon**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: What's.
**Jremillard**: What's bollard paint for?
**Acannon**: Just to paint the bollards.
**Jremillard**: Are we doing poly sleeves or paint?
**Acannon**: I was gonna figure out painting.
**Acannon**: I guess I don't know what the difference is with the poly sleeves, but I spent 100 bucks each in there to paint them.
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Speaker 2**: I would guess a poly sleeve can be too much.
**Speaker 2**: Could should be around 100 bucks.
**Jremillard**: Right on uline for a 6 inch by 56 inch normal old smoothie.
**Jremillard**: All is 45 bucks.
**Acannon**: Okay, that covers us.
**Jremillard**: Case.
**Acannon**: Touch up at the dock.
**Acannon**: You know, when they cut the dock leveler, if they have to touch up the paint around them, I figured 250 a pop.
**Acannon**: And then just a prime and paint touch up and a top out.
**Acannon**: Like those existing walls.
**Acannon**: I'm not sure.
**Speaker 2**: Does that.
**Speaker 2**: What do we call it, that security.
**Speaker 2**: Little security office thing.
**Speaker 2**: Does that come pre painted and everything?
**Speaker 2**: We have to do any finish work to that?
**Jremillard**: Yeah, they'll probably.
**Jremillard**: Those won't come finished on the inside at all.
**Acannon**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: So that'll just be like your regular old garden shed you're building out.
**Acannon**: So we'll need to do some finishes in there.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, probably drywall.
**Jremillard**: And then they usually just have a plywood floor.
**Acannon**: Okay.
**Speaker 2**: We're doing nothing to the exterior walls on the outside.
**Jremillard**: Probably just a coat of paint.
**Jremillard**: The concrete floor sealer, is that.
**Jremillard**: Is this just regular sealer?
**Jremillard**: Is it like Ashford?
**Acannon**: I was just figuring what I have $2 a square foot.
**Acannon**: And honestly, like all of this concrete's, you know, that polished concrete in there.
**Acannon**: I don't think we're gonna do the most of it.
**Acannon**: And so it's more of a.
**Acannon**: We'll put a coat of sealer on it to make them feel better.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Acannon**: I mean just looking at it, you know, looking at these numbers, if you look at the drawing, does it feel right?
**Acannon**: That's what I do.
**Speaker 2**: Feelings.
**Acannon**: Feelings.
**Acannon**: Because you know, I guess you're building a.
**Acannon**: We're building a 9,000 square foot house without a roof.
**Acannon**: So let's see here.
**Acannon**: Signage.
**Acannon**: I put 2500 for that, but that should be just some Door signs.
**Acannon**: I didn't change.
**Acannon**: Toilet accessories, bathroom partitions.
**Acannon**: This is based on just the last job we did up here in Indy.
**Acannon**: I don't know if they're that much different down there, but.
**Jremillard**: It'S the cost stuff is weird between regions.
**Jremillard**: I don't even know what lockers would price out at down here, but if that.
**Jremillard**: Those are usually like national vendor type items, so I would think it's pretty consistent.
**Acannon**: Yeah.
**Acannon**: Okay.
**Acannon**: These are all that one guy's quote contact equipment.
**Acannon**: That's all the true number cabinets.
**Acannon**: Figured $700 a linear foot for them, 300 bucks a linear foot for the quartz.
**Acannon**: Just doing a quick takeoff.
**Acannon**: It's like 158 linear foot of cabinets in here.
**Acannon**: I'm guessing that's what market means.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: Like all their casework for their break room.
**Acannon**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Acannon**: Looking at it, you think that sounds about right?
**Jremillard**: Yeah, I think that's for the casework end.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: Bathrooms.
**Speaker 2**: Did we get those?
**Acannon**: There's only.
**Acannon**: They just got wall hung sinks.
**Jremillard**: The partitions are going to rack up a little cost.
**Jremillard**: Oh, that's what they want.
**Speaker 2**: Bathroom finishes.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: This grab bars captured for the ADA stall.
**Acannon**: Yeah.
**Acannon**: So that's where I put in $2,000 a bathroom for specialties.
**Acannon**: Oh, that's plenty.
**Acannon**: And then the partitions, you know, there's.
**Acannon**: You look at it, you got these two sets of partitions in here.
**Acannon**: You got these two sets in here.
**Acannon**: And then each of these has same setup.
**Acannon**: So 1, 2, 3 or 2, 4, 6, 8.
**Acannon**: Eight bathrooms.
**Acannon**: So we're 19.
**Jremillard**: I think there's 19 partitions.
**Jremillard**: Okay, I'm just going.
**Jremillard**: Partitions.
**Acannon**: So 19 partitions.
**Jremillard**: I think I'd have to count them to make sure.
**Jremillard**: But I was just trying to keep up.
**Jremillard**: But I think that's what it is.
**Acannon**: Oh, here.
**Acannon**: Sorry, too fast.
**Acannon**: T screens.
**Acannon**: Do they count?
**Jremillard**: I didn't count those.
**Acannon**: So based on 19 of them we got.
**Acannon**: I mean that would.
**Acannon**: Individual partitions make them a little over $2,000 a stall.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, because they go ahead.
**Speaker 2**: Are they doing electric hand dryers or what are we pricing there that in your toilet.
**Acannon**: I'm sure it's paper.
**Acannon**: Imagine having 100 employees waiting around to dry their hands off.
**Speaker 2**: I guess I.
**Speaker 2**: This is my first warehouse project, so I gotta put that hat on.
**Acannon**: Oh, I.
**Acannon**: I'm not an expert on this, but my mind would tell me that.
**Acannon**: I don't know, Jesse.
**Acannon**: I don't know if you know, there's any rhyme or reason to that, but.
**Jremillard**: No to what?
**Speaker 2**: Just thinking of anything we could have missed.
**Jremillard**: Oh, well, we're not doing the foot wash room or the prayer room, so don't gotta include that.
**Acannon**: Oh yeah, the eastbound arrow.
**Acannon**: Okay, let's get through this.
**Acannon**: So dock equipment, furnishings, vanities.
**Acannon**: There is none.
**Acannon**: Take that out.
**Jremillard**: There's no kind of table or anything in their bigger bathrooms.
**Acannon**: A wall hung.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Acannon**: Water fountains there and like this mother's first aid that's got.
**Acannon**: I figured that is just a counter.
**Acannon**: That'll be drop in sink, baby changing station.
**Acannon**: Oh, I think this is where they go.
**Acannon**: They milk themselves in these places.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, it's like the little pod in the airport that was Jesse's house.
**Acannon**: Got milk rooms now.
**Acannon**: You've been in a bunch of them.
**Acannon**: I can't believe you don't know it.
**Jremillard**: I got pictures of the ones in the airports.
**Jremillard**: Those things are fascinating.
**Acannon**: Oh, that took me a second.
**Acannon**: You're like, was it Jim Carrey and me, myself and Irene pops down on that chick.
**Acannon**: Okay, so temp TCO, fencing.
**Acannon**: I put 50,000 in there, you know, for.
**Acannon**: You know that.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Acannon**: In between your inspections.
**Jremillard**: Plastic and fence panel spot.
**Acannon**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: Empty co.
**Jremillard**: Do we need ceiling kite barrier there, Dino?
**Acannon**: I wouldn't think so.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, if we could just get away with fence panels right there with a gate on each end, that'd be perfect.
**Acannon**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: I didn't know how they'd be with working at heights.
**Acannon**: Oh yeah, I don't think that matters.
**Acannon**: I think it's more.
**Acannon**: Well, I don't know.
**Acannon**: You know, the inspectors are better than me, but it'd only be something the building inspector would.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, and I did check down here and I got it.
**Jremillard**: I got a no on that.
**Acannon**: Oh, really?
**Jremillard**: Well, they said they didn't.
**Jremillard**: Didn't think the inspectors would care.
**Acannon**: Okay, yeah, maybe Amazon.
**Acannon**: But if they want us to put up something taller than we're like.
**Acannon**: Okay, it's this much.
**Acannon**: It's this many dollars.
**Acannon**: Yep.
**Acannon**: But.
**Acannon**: And then the maintenance cage, we priced several of these out recently.
**Acannon**: I think $300 a linear foot is pretty good number.
**Acannon**: It looks like it's a 20 by 20 cage.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, I think that's a very good number.
**Acannon**: Okay.
**Acannon**: Fire suppression.
**Acannon**: I just figured $5 a square foot based on reinter ceilings and just put $10,000 in there extra.
**Jremillard**: Is there a permit cost line on this?
**Acannon**: There's not.
**Acannon**: We'll probably exclude permit costs.
**Acannon**: Just we don't know what they are.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Acannon**: I mean if you look at this like as a sprinkler company, they should have.
**Acannon**: I mean they should be able to just come in and branch off of the lines above there, drop down some heads.
**Speaker 2**: Unless you got to move the entire sprinkler system.
**Acannon**: No, because they'll leave all the uprights up top.
**Acannon**: They just drop down a line to feed all this spray.
**Speaker 2**: They're at the top of the joists.
**Acannon**: You think that's good, Jesse?
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: I'm assuming that sprinkler guy is going to want to join in on the site visit.
**Jremillard**: If you get a hold of Andrew.
**Acannon**: Which one?
**Speaker 2**: What was his name?
**Jremillard**: I don't remember.
**Jremillard**: It's.
**Jremillard**: It's in there.
**Speaker 2**: Oh, I think it's Eric.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, Eric.
**Jremillard**: Eric.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Acannon**: I guess, like he was the.
**Speaker 2**: Only one who didn't answer, but his email and everything was there, so we're good.
**Speaker 2**: But he was in a meeting.
**Jremillard**: He said, oh, yeah, he's gonna want to go.
**Acannon**: All right, we'll go seven here then.
**Acannon**: Oh, I.
**Acannon**: Sometimes I don't think about the fact they got to do all the Off a lift.
**Acannon**: So it's going to be twice as expensive anyways.
**Jremillard**: And I have a cheap company down here that just rents lifts.
**Acannon**: Okay.
**Acannon**: Okay.
**Acannon**: Plumbing.
**Acannon**: We got that 400 number.
**Acannon**: I put 30 in there for whatever fixtures.
**Acannon**: So the H vac.
**Acannon**: Did you get any?
**Jremillard**: Well, that's.
**Jremillard**: That's 400.
**Jremillard**: I just didn't put the zeros.
**Jremillard**: I added bathrooms, plumbing number.
**Acannon**: Oh, yeah, it says 400,000.
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: I just didn't put the cents, so it looks like it's 40, but that means.
**Jremillard**: I was talking about that email.
**Jremillard**: He said 380 to 4, but I just put it at 4 for the budget.
**Acannon**: Huh.
**Acannon**: I just put that in there.
**Acannon**: We'll see how.
**Acannon**: I just put all these things.
**Acannon**: I wrote internal next to them.
**Acannon**: If we're trying to build up, you know, once we get the H Vac and electric in there.
**Acannon**: So you're saying you didn't get a price H vac?
**Jremillard**: Not yet.
**Acannon**: Okay, so then mini split.
**Acannon**: We'll say that's.
**Acannon**: Let's say that's $10,000 H vac.
**Acannon**: The offices that.
**Jremillard**: We figure that's one RTU, right?
**Acannon**: One per.
**Acannon**: So we got three offices.
**Acannon**: Three offices.
**Acannon**: 30% more.
**Jremillard**: How many tons are these ones?
**Acannon**: If we figure, I mean, it's 4,000 square feet.
**Acannon**: We're dropping a ceiling and insulating it.
**Acannon**: So it's not like it's trying to do a whole warehouse.
**Acannon**: I would think 10, 20.
**Acannon**: 10 or 15 ton.
**Acannon**: So let's say 75,000 per office for the ductwork, roof, curb.
**Acannon**: Wait.
**Acannon**: 220.
**Acannon**: There's no BAS.
**Acannon**: I don't know.
**Acannon**: We'll put a Number in there for it.
**Acannon**: Big ass fan.
**Acannon**: So the electrician.
**Acannon**: What are those big ass fans.
**Acannon**: They're like 10 grand a piece, aren't they?
**Acannon**: They're pretty expensive.
**Speaker 2**: We got some for Westfield Collective.
**Acannon**: I can't remember.
**Jremillard**: Hey guys, for the eighth a big eight footer.
**Jremillard**: It's saying like four grand ten foot.
**Acannon**: Four grand ten foot.
**Acannon**: And these, the ones that were in There were like 20s, weren't they?
**Jremillard**: Yeah, I think they were bigger than that.
**Jremillard**: They were huge.
**Acannon**: So 10 grand a piece is $200,000 worth of f.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, they don't give you any pricing.
**Jremillard**: On the big ass fan website, get a quote.
**Speaker 2**: Who would have thought?
**Speaker 2**: I was trying to find.
**Acannon**: So this just lighting power to new offices.
**Acannon**: Say they're going to spend 45 per office.
**Jremillard**: Oh, those giant ones are five grand for five grand?
**Jremillard**: Yeah, for an 18 foot.
**Acannon**: Okay, so if you figure six grand.
**Acannon**: Yes fans.
**Acannon**: What's that?
**Jremillard**: I just thinking of putting a 16 in my entryway.
**Acannon**: Hard MDF room.
**Acannon**: See, we got $10,000 in that one.
**Acannon**: Low voltage raceways.
**Speaker 2**: 24 foot fan is 8,500.
**Acannon**: Check.
**Acannon**: Power added panels.
**Acannon**: Talking 400,000 power.
**Acannon**: Discover the golf cart charger Equipment chargers.
**Acannon**: We got.
**Acannon**: We have.
**Acannon**: There's a total of 121.
**Acannon**: Is that it?
**Jremillard**: Equipment chargers?
**Acannon**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: Where in the are.
**Jremillard**: Where are those things?
**Acannon**: It's on that sheet.
**Jremillard**: That electrical addendum Right on the latest.
**Acannon**: It's new, see.
**Acannon**: Yeah, the 617 set.
**Acannon**: MHE update layout.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, that's what I'm on.
**Jremillard**: It's not loading the bottoms of them so I can't see what it is.
**Acannon**: Oh no, it's doc Equipment.
**Jremillard**: Dock equipment.
**Acannon**: Oh no, no, it's not there.
**Acannon**: I'm sorry.
**Acannon**: Let's see what sheet mhe charging stations.
**Acannon**: There's so it's the one called MVF room detail, but it's got those, and there's 57 and 69.
**Acannon**: There's actually 126 of these things.
**Jremillard**: What page are you on?
**Jremillard**: Equipment charging detail and quantity.
**Acannon**: No, it's the 618 set.
**Acannon**: MDF room power updated to plans.
**Acannon**: That's actually that she has.
**Jremillard**: Oh, okay, I see it.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, this is the one that wouldn't load for me.
**Jremillard**: I must have just had to open it again.
**Acannon**: I tried to flip these pages right when I uploaded them and it wouldn't let me.
**Acannon**: Andrew, can you fix that?
**Speaker 2**: I was cleaning up my voicemail.
**Speaker 2**: My inbox was full.
**Speaker 2**: Say that again.
**Acannon**: I said when I uploaded these I tried to flip them the right way.
**Acannon**: It let me do One of them, but it wouldn't let me flip the other one, so that's why they're cockeyed.
**Speaker 2**: Which set is that?
**Jremillard**: The addendum?
**Acannon**: The 6:18 set.
**Speaker 2**: You want them all to look like the first one?
**Acannon**: Well, I want to be able to not my head over and look at my.
**Acannon**: To read it.
**Acannon**: Yeah.
**Acannon**: Brandon.
**Speaker 2**: Brandon just turns his head like this and reads it.
**Speaker 2**: You ever notice he'll just turn his head completely?
**Acannon**: Yeah, well, he's a weirdo.
**Acannon**: So we're normal.
**Acannon**: There's no more normal people in this earth than me and Jesse too.
**Speaker 2**: You just flip them.
**Acannon**: How the hell do you do that?
**Acannon**: Fire alarm mods.
**Acannon**: We'll say 45,000.
**Acannon**: Put that in there.
**Acannon**: Plug add panel.
**Acannon**: So if you look at when they went in and it's here.
**Acannon**: So they went in here.
**Acannon**: And I went in at one point and just looked what was existing.
**Acannon**: And this was a panel, a drawing that came out where they were going to add all these panels to power all this up.
**Acannon**: They were putting in 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 existing 12 on that 1, 14, 15, 23, 20, 26 panels.
**Acannon**: But they were mostly for like bunch of H vac.
**Acannon**: You know, this.
**Acannon**: These are the panel schedules for those new panels.
**Acannon**: Bunch of RTUs.
**Acannon**: It never happened.
**Acannon**: So.
**Acannon**: So I'm wondering.
**Acannon**: 26 panels.
**Jremillard**: So that's.
**Jremillard**: That's all those stations around the warehouse with just the conduits to plug the panels in, right?
**Acannon**: I think probably.
**Acannon**: Yeah, maybe that's a good point.
**Acannon**: I didn't check.
**Acannon**: I have to go back and check that.
**Acannon**: But if we're the 26 panels.
**Speaker 2**: Jesse, did you say you're hoping.
**Speaker 2**: Hoping to do the sitewalk Tuesday or Wednesday next week?
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: And I'm gonna take pictures of every square inch of this place.
**Speaker 2**: Is that Tuesday or Wednesday?
**Jremillard**: It's gonna be one of the other Brandons checking with Bill.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Acannon**: Nicole Brandon.
**Acannon**: He's on the call sequence, is he?
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, if A.J.
**Speaker 2**: convinced him to come out.
**Acannon**: Those two lazy.
**Speaker 2**: They don't want it like we do.
**Acannon**: Yeah, I disagree.
**Acannon**: They definitely do want it.
**Acannon**: Hey.
**Acannon**: So we weren't able to get a H VAC number or an electrician's number.
**Acannon**: The one electrician that Jesse was talking to, I don't think he unders like, the guy just wasn't pricing stuff.
**Acannon**: A little crazy.
**Acannon**: So his local electrician, he's waiting for him to get back, but, you know, plugging in.
**Acannon**: So to go to the numbers we did get.
**Acannon**: So we got a dock equipment number.
**Acannon**: We got.
**Acannon**: I'll put you on speaker here.
**Speaker 2**: What about, what about as far as.
**Acannon**: When will we have those numbers?
**Acannon**: Like, can I tell Bill I'll have it Monday?
**Acannon**: What do you think, Jesse?
**Jremillard**: So we, the, the numbers we want to get budget numbers from the subs are basically the MEPs.
**Acannon**: Yeah, because I've even, We've gone through here and just plugged some numbers for everything.
**Acannon**: We're at 10 million.
**Acannon**: So are these guys going to give us numbers on Monday?
**Acannon**: Well, that's the thing, Jesse.
**Acannon**: What's your feeling?
**Acannon**: You think he's supposed to get a.
**Acannon**: Several of them come in this afternoon?
**Acannon**: Obviously the three o' clock.
**Acannon**: Yeah, it's two o' clock there.
**Acannon**: Go ahead, Jesse.
**Jremillard**: Just for the budget numbers, I can push to get them on Monday.
**Jremillard**: As far as I don't really have anything meeting wise Monday, so I could probably put a lot of time into pounding them.
**Acannon**: I mean the thing is I just, I gotta know.
**Acannon**: Yeah, I gotta like I can't.
**Acannon**: I don't want to sell him Monday and then like, oh, we're pushing and then I'm calling him again on Monday.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, well, I hear you.
**Acannon**: Can we call some of these guys and be like, listen, like we were.
**Speaker 2**: Supposed to have this thing.
**Acannon**: I understand the miscommunication.
**Acannon**: Are you going to be able to get me a number on Monday?
**Acannon**: I need a no assessment.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, that's kind of what I'm waiting for.
**Jremillard**: Callbacks from everyone for right now.
**Jremillard**: I've already made the rounds this afternoon, so.
**Jremillard**: All right, so getting all those calls back with the NEP.
**Acannon**: Peace, Paul.
**Acannon**: Jesse, we're a kin.
**Acannon**: 10 million, 141.
**Acannon**: Does that include the electrical that I already submitted or no?
**Acannon**: Yeah, that includes the 2 million lighting number you had.
**Acannon**: Okay, so.
**Acannon**: All right, well, you had, I guess, yeah, if you can.
**Acannon**: You know, I don't want to, I don't want to call Bill and tell him anything until I have the information.
**Acannon**: So if you can make some calls and see if these guys can commit to a Monday number, that would be helpful.
**Acannon**: Yep.
**Acannon**: All right.
**Acannon**: All right, Appreciate it, guys.
**Acannon**: All right.
**Acannon**: Yep.
**Jremillard**: Thank you.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, I'll push for budget numbers for Monday.
**Jremillard**: So can I just go through the list real quick and clarify exactly which ones I need to push?
**Acannon**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: So electrical lighting package?
**Acannon**: Well, it's electrical.
**Jremillard**: Or do they want the whole thing?
**Acannon**: Well, we just like a general idea of like you're.
**Acannon**: It's 126 chargers.
**Acannon**: We're wiring up, we're providing, you know, new panels.
**Acannon**: It's so tough to get to get that.
**Acannon**: But it's just a general number.
**Acannon**: 126 chargers, power and outlets to the three new offices and you know, and the lights.
**Acannon**: And if we can get that.
**Acannon**: We can.
**Acannon**: I'm sure we can.
**Acannon**: We would be fine.
**Jremillard**: And then we want the H Vac.
**Acannon**: H vac?
**Acannon**: Yep.
**Jremillard**: And then we already got the plumbing, so that one's good.
**Acannon**: Plumbing's good.
**Acannon**: Fire suppression, I feel good.
**Jremillard**: We want framing, right?
**Acannon**: Yeah, if we can get his framing number.
**Acannon**: I mean, I.
**Acannon**: I can't believe it would cost more than 250 to do that.
**Jremillard**: No, I think that's a good number.
**Acannon**: And the finisher, it's not a whole lot because they don't have to finish any of the wall above the ceiling.
**Acannon**: And nothing on the warehouse side.
**Acannon**: It's just drywall.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: Because they're just putting act up.
**Jremillard**: Right.
**Acannon**: So.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, run the paint and hang the grid.
**Acannon**: Yeah.
**Acannon**: Up to nine foot, you're done.
**Acannon**: You know, the carpet, we're good with that.
**Acannon**: You know, all these finishes will be fine.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, just the big stuff, but it's.
**Acannon**: The big MEP stuff.
**Acannon**: And doors, we're fine with that.
**Acannon**: We can make that work.
**Acannon**: 81,000 to do two doors.
**Acannon**: You know, the roofer, it'd be great if he gets us a number, but $50,000 to.
**Acannon**: Well, 40,000 to put some roof curbs in.
**Acannon**: We should be good.
**Acannon**: Would.
**Acannon**: I don't care about the railings.
**Acannon**: Would be nice to have a number, but.
**Acannon**: And, but again, I'm comfortable.
**Acannon**: That's something you can.
**Acannon**: We can check that plug by Monday.
**Acannon**: We'll get that done.
**Jremillard**: Andrew.
**Jremillard**: Sorry.
**Speaker 2**: Yes, sir.
**Jremillard**: Can you check with that roofer that's getting back to you after his meeting and that metal rail guy and just see if they can get you some budget numbers by noon Pacific on Monday or 10 or whatever you want to call it because it's only quarter to three here.
**Jremillard**: So this side of the US Is still trickling out for the week.
**Speaker 2**: Roof, roofer and rail.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, it should just be a generic foot.
**Jremillard**: Almost like a foot price from each of them.
**Acannon**: Exactly.
**Speaker 2**: That's just based off their what's on their scope sheet.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, I mean a square foot.
**Jremillard**: Square foot of walk path, however big those curbs are, price per curb to tie the roof into them.
**Acannon**: Yeah, just tell them you can go off of this.
**Acannon**: Say I need 160 linear foot of walk pad and I'm roofing in four 20 ton rooftop units.
**Speaker 2**: It was 160 linear square feet.
**Speaker 2**: And what roof, what roof pad?
**Acannon**: 160 linear foot of roof walk pad.
**Speaker 2**: And then there was something else you said, Jesse.
**Acannon**: We just tell them we're putting four 20 ton RTUs in and five plumbing vents.
**Acannon**: And then we got the one data sleeve for the telco room.
**Acannon**: Forgot about that.
**Acannon**: I think there's only going to be four vents.
**Acannon**: So.
**Acannon**: So Jesse, is there like if.
**Acannon**: Are you able to get the H VAC and electrical do you need.
**Jremillard**: I should be able to get that.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: It's a hard day of the week to try to guess with people.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, because they're all bailing for the weekend.
**Jremillard**: But I mean Monday noon is kind of a big ask.
**Jremillard**: But it's just budget numbers.
**Acannon**: Exactly.
**Acannon**: Tell them.
**Acannon**: I'm not even going to hold you to this.
**Acannon**: I just want to.
**Acannon**: A budget like you can finalize it in the next day because I'm going to take your number and add 20% to it.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, H vac.
**Jremillard**: I should be easy because I just sent this out to Bel Air Mechanical who's a big one framing.
**Jremillard**: I'm supposed to talk to Matt and Fred today.
**Jremillard**: And then that electrical.
**Jremillard**: That might be kind of a tough one.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, I try.
**Jremillard**: I tried to call Dan and I sent him a text and I haven't heard back from him.
**Jremillard**: So he may be gone to wherever people go on the weekends.
**Jremillard**: Here.
**Acannon**: You want to set it up for like I can get on the call too if you think it would help to have us both on there answer anything or if you got it.
**Acannon**: I don't want to get in there and confuse things either.
**Speaker 2**: We want all bids by what, next Friday?
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: I've been telling people close the Business Pacific next Friday.
**Speaker 2**: 27Th.
**Acannon**: That we're.
**Acannon**: We're going in early to get.
**Acannon**: To get the thing so we can just get it approved and then they won't even look for that last date.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, that's part of the reason I'm trying to get.
**Jremillard**: Let me see what his name was.
**Jremillard**: Where is he?
**Jremillard**: Oh, Daniel Bobbin.
**Acannon**: The Mr.
**Acannon**: Bobbitt.
**Jremillard**: I couldn't think of anything at the time to send back about that.
**Speaker 2**: Where are we doing railing at?
**Jremillard**: I don't remember.
**Acannon**: 200 a foot.
**Acannon**: $200 a linear foot is like a thousand.
**Acannon**: It's all on this estimate sheet here.
**Speaker 2**: Do we need.
**Speaker 2**: So we're good on railing budget.
**Acannon**: I mean if you.
**Acannon**: He's already got a guy lined up for you, you can just ask him to confirm and just say listen, it's $200 a linear foot.
**Acannon**: A good price to supply and install a metal railing on the inside of a building when it's a Thousand linear foot of it.
**Jremillard**: I'm gonna share another one with you, Andrew.
**Jremillard**: Duffy's kind of a nut bag, but he's good at doing metal shit.
**Speaker 2**: Duffy, Grease monkey repair.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: Believe it or not, he's like a fucking high end custom fence guy.
**Jremillard**: Because there's the group of them that go to all the people's houses in Scottsdale.
**Jremillard**: So.
**Jremillard**: And I think, Andrew, that Switch might be able to spit out a fast budget number for the electrical.
**Jremillard**: And I think Hawkeye is going to tell you that they're booked out till December or something crazy.
**Jremillard**: So they're not even going to be worth talking to, but it's worth checking.
**Speaker 2**: So Hawkeye and Switch, we want to see if they can get a budget number by Monday.
**Jremillard**: I would see with them.
**Jremillard**: I.
**Jremillard**: Switch is probably going to back out when you tell them how soon it's going to start, but.
**Jremillard**: Or Hawkeye will.
**Jremillard**: But I bet you Switch will do it.
**Jremillard**: And then do we need to address anything with the engineering end on this estimate right now, Jesse, we're just gonna.
**Acannon**: We're gonna have to like, architecturally, we're just.
**Acannon**: We'll throw a.
**Acannon**: Like.
**Acannon**: I'll just plug some numbers in here.
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Acannon**: Attack.
**Acannon**: Because again, this is simple shit.
**Acannon**: So let's say I should have something.
**Jremillard**: Back from Kevin on that today, too.
**Acannon**: Okay?
**Jremillard**: And I got two more firms.
**Jremillard**: I'm waiting for contact info for.
**Acannon**: 500,000 for electrical engineering.
**Acannon**: A joke.
**Acannon**: Our sprinkler, it's going to be in there now.
**Acannon**: We can get that sprinkler done for 10 grand.
**Acannon**: Hello?
**Acannon**: Yeah.
**Acannon**: Thank you.
**Acannon**: Oh, no, I'll keep that.
**Acannon**: Thanks.
**Acannon**: Thank you.
**Acannon**: Okay, so then do you want to.
**Acannon**: You want to make those calls and then call me back and then we'll let Bill know, like.
**Acannon**: Or let Brandon will let Bill know.
**Acannon**: If you think we can get it Monday.
**Acannon**: What's your feelings?
**Acannon**: What's your gut feeling, Jesse?
**Jremillard**: I think it's a.
**Jremillard**: It's a stretch, but for what little.
**Jremillard**: We need budget.
**Jremillard**: Budget numbers for as long as we communicate it to them the right way, I think we can pull it off.
**Acannon**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: It's just important they know when they call.
**Jremillard**: When do you call, Andrew?
**Jremillard**: That it's budget numbers.
**Jremillard**: It's for a budget, not a hard bid.
**Jremillard**: And the hard bids are next week because they're going to overthink it and try to get all crazy with it.
**Speaker 2**: Yes, I've had them do that a couple times.
**Speaker 2**: The dot com did that to me there.
**Acannon**: Yeah, we only like, dude, it's a budget number.
**Acannon**: I know.
**Speaker 2**: He's like, you're gonna hold us accountable and all this stuff.
**Speaker 2**: And I'm like, no.
**Speaker 2**: Or not.
**Acannon**: Yeah, no.
**Acannon**: But I won't call you back when I get the job.
**Acannon**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: But I.
**Speaker 2**: I do have a dinner here at 7:30.
**Speaker 2**: It's almost six my time, so I'm gonna hop off and try to get all this done because I still got.
**Acannon**: Emails to jumping on the couch.
**Speaker 2**: Oh, it's my roommate's damn cat that won't leave me alone.
**Jremillard**: You're having good luck on Grindr in Indianapolis.
**Acannon**: God damn it.
**Speaker 2**: It's the best.
**Acannon**: Okay, so we'll.
**Acannon**: We'll say we're going to be good.
**Acannon**: Like, and.
**Acannon**: And what?
**Acannon**: I'm thinking, like, we just.
**Acannon**: We got a job out in New Jersey.
**Acannon**: Deem Electric went out there.
**Acannon**: We're adding a 1200amp service, couple panels, step down transformers.
**Acannon**: The service, they got to run all.
**Acannon**: You know, they're running halfway across this warehouse to get to the electrical room.
**Acannon**: And, you know, they had some lighting work and some other things.
**Acannon**: They were about 600,000.
**Acannon**: So if I figure the 1200amp service and some panels, if we can figure 600,000 for one, there's only, you know, we only got room for two maybe, or three of these because, you know, we got two, 3,000amp services, and they both have 800amp panels coming off of them.
**Acannon**: So, like, we're down to 4.
**Acannon**: So that's 2.4 million.
**Acannon**: In my mind, we could get Dean to do it, and then.
**Jremillard**: Is there any reason he can't crank us out a budget number?
**Acannon**: I may call him.
**Jremillard**: That might be the quickest option for a budget number.
**Jremillard**: At least we have a parameter and something to put on here that we know we'll get in time.
**Jremillard**: I'll still push for the other ones, but.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, might be good just to do.
**Acannon**: But that's where I'm thinking, if you tell these guys I have.
**Acannon**: I want two 1200amp panels or say three.
**Acannon**: Three 1200amps.
**Acannon**: 3600 max is out three of them.
**Jremillard**: Three 12s and three sixes.
**Acannon**: So three 1200amp panels fed from the main gear room.
**Acannon**: And they're going to feed.
**Acannon**: Say, I don't know what you get out of those.
**Acannon**: Yeah, so then we get.
**Jremillard**: 57.
**Acannon**: Yeah, I would say.
**Acannon**: And then figure seven sub panels out of those to feed each equipment.
**Jremillard**: So three 1200, 27, six hundreds, and 20.
**Acannon**: Well, like 400amp panels.
**Acannon**: Like 400amp are usually easier to get.
**Acannon**: So they would feed three 400amp panels out of those.
**Acannon**: And then.
**Acannon**: Yeah, so we have nine 400amp panels, three 1200amp services.
**Acannon**: Just as a general, like a.
**Acannon**: Like a goat, like a start point.
**Acannon**: And then I gotta.
**Acannon**: I'm gonna have to call that, that charging guy, the guy that does the load sharing and then see out of there.
**Speaker 2**: The.
**Speaker 2**: I just called the roofer.
**Speaker 2**: He's at a trade show and won't be back till Monday.
**Speaker 2**: So he's not going to be able to give us anything that quickly.
**Acannon**: Okay.
**Speaker 2**: Daniel, bop it.
**Speaker 2**: I thought he was the railing guy.
**Speaker 2**: He's like, I do roofing.
**Jremillard**: I'm like, oh well he told me he does metal work.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, no I don't.
**Speaker 2**: I asked if he did rail and he said no.
**Jremillard**: I know that Duffy does.
**Jremillard**: Real.
**Acannon**: Duffy.
**Acannon**: Jesus.
**Acannon**: Okay.
**Acannon**: All right, well let's do it and we'll do it.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, I'll text you if I'm able to get any of these people on the phone and they have any questions that are better for it to try to loop you in on.
**Jremillard**: But yeah, I'll just keep pushing to try to get these guys to give us something.
**Acannon**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: And it's three o' clock here, so I got two more business hours and then I'll shoot you guys an email and let you know where I landed.
**Acannon**: All right, awesome.
**Acannon**: I appreciate you, Jesse.
**Jremillard**: Likewise.
**Jremillard**: Thank you guys.
**Acannon**: Thanks.
**Acannon**: We'll see.
**Acannon**: Andrew, go have your dinner with your grinder.
**Acannon**: You're muted.
**Speaker 2**: Duffy.
**Speaker 2**: Duffy said they've done a little bit of railing in the past, but not enough to be able to there.
**Speaker 2**: I can ask Chat GPT.
**Jremillard**: It's done whole pools for me.
**Acannon**: Well here I can tell you right now.
**Acannon**: Let's see.
**Acannon**: Average.
**Jremillard**: This is just this chain link or this fancy fence.
**Acannon**: The site fence will be just chain link.
**Acannon**: Yeah, chain link.
**Jremillard**: So that's what we're trying to find an installer is chain link.
**Acannon**: No.
**Acannon**: Well, we'll need a fence installed for the outside, but inside it's just a guardrail.
**Acannon**: It's a metal.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Acannon**: Yeah, yeah.
**Acannon**: So interior metal guard.
**Acannon**: So 40 to 250 per linear foot.
**Acannon**: We go in at 200, we can get that done all day.
**Speaker 2**: This is stainless steel or aluminum?
**Speaker 2**: Aluminum, high end, corrosion resistant.
**Speaker 2**: 200 to $350.
**Acannon**: That's the top.
**Acannon**: But we want steel.
**Acannon**: If there's.
**Acannon**: We're gonna paint it up, we ought to put a paint number on that too.
**Acannon**: Then I would think they'd want to paint it yellow or something.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, they're probably gonna want all this safety yellow caution yellow.
**Acannon**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: Standard painted steel commercial grade shot.
**Speaker 2**: Welded 90 to 140 custom architectural painted steel, 150 to 220.
**Speaker 2**: Painted tube steel handrail, 120 to 180.
**Acannon**: There we go.
**Acannon**: See, we're going to pick up a little money.
**Acannon**: Okay.
**Speaker 2**: Okay, so that just leaves I just need to call the two electrical companies and then I'll send out the emails to the other subs that I added in Job Planner.
**Acannon**: That's it.
**Speaker 2**: Unless I'm forgetting something.
**Speaker 2**: Oh, I got a guy who's gonna hopefully give me architects in the area.
**Acannon**: Need to fix this somehow so that current set doesn't show all those new drawings.
**Acannon**: I don't know what the fuck's going on there, but they're gonna think that's the current set.
**Jremillard**: Oh, how the original drawings some made it into the set folder?
**Acannon**: Well, yeah, there's, there's like it says current set and this doesn't say anything about existing plans.
**Acannon**: Then you gotta go all the way to the bottom to get to the new drawings first.
**Acannon**: Need to fix that, Andrew.
**Acannon**: Somehow make them not the current set or manage versions.
**Acannon**: At the top it says listing building.
**Speaker 2**: Drawings issued on my screen shows and click on it says current set.
**Speaker 2**: And then it says addendum and it says DD1.
**Speaker 2**: Then existing building at the.
**Speaker 2**: All at the top.
**Jremillard**: Oh, in the drop down at the.
**Speaker 2**: End, the existing building drawings issued 06.18, 2017.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, somehow they made it into the current set folder on mine.
**Jremillard**: Tooth.
**Jremillard**: That's when I texted you last night and I was like, Is it actually 225 pages?
**Acannon**: Yeah.
**Acannon**: And this issued on date.
**Acannon**: Maybe we change that to manage version Edit.
**Acannon**: No, cancel.
**Speaker 2**: Oh, now I see.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: 10, 17, 17.
**Jremillard**: Is that.
**Acannon**: Issued on date?
**Acannon**: June 2017.
**Acannon**: You got it on there?
**Acannon**: Close.
**Jremillard**: I don't.
**Acannon**: But it says issued on 6, 7.
**Speaker 2**: I didn't make that current set one though.
**Speaker 2**: I just did DD1 and existing building drawings.
**Speaker 2**: Does Job Planner do that?
**Speaker 2**: That like combines them all?
**Jremillard**: No, when I mail people the link, it's in different folders like it is at the top on this.
**Jremillard**: But they're all in the same same current set folder.
**Acannon**: Well, because I guess it's the.
**Acannon**: There's only that version of that drawing, but I don't know.
**Acannon**: Well, we can look at that.
**Acannon**: We're not going to figure that out tonight.
**Acannon**: And you guys, I know you got.
**Acannon**: You're running out of time out there to get in touch with people, so.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, I got to get some calls going.
**Acannon**: So we'll, we'll be fine.
**Acannon**: I'm confident we'll be good.
**Acannon**: So appreciate all your help.
**Jremillard**: Thank you, guys.
**Acannon**: Yep.
**Acannon**: We'll see you.
**Jremillard**: See you.
