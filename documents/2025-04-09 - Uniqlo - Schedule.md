## Transcript
**Bclymer**: Hey, Joe.
**Jdawson**: Hey, Jesse.
**Bclymer**: Hey.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Hey, Jesse.
**Jdawson**: Jesse, are we waiting for Brandon?
**Joseph.burdzy**: I just talked to him a couple minutes ago, so he should be me.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Send him a message.
**Jdawson**: Oh, here he is.
**Bclymer**: Here it is.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Brandon.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Hey, Brandon, can you hear us?
**Joseph.burdzy**: Is his microphone mute?
**Joseph.burdzy**: Muted?
**Jdawson**: It shows that it is muted.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Okay, send him a message.
**Jdawson**: Oh, he just dropped and he's coming back in.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Brandon, I actually heard you.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Brandon, you able to hear us?
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Yeah, I can.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yusuke, are you there?
**John.min**: Yup, I'm here.
**Jdawson**: Okay, perfect.
**Jdawson**: All right, I guess we can get started.
**Jdawson**: I think the purpose of this call is to kind of establish our start date, mobilization date based off of acquiring permits.
**Jdawson**: So Brandon, I'll kind of let you and Jesse take the reins on the call.
**Jdawson**: I know that the client requested some specific.
**Jdawson**: Some specific dates.
**Jdawson**: So we're trying to aim currently for shipping three sign and sealed sets to the DOB on the 18th.
**Jdawson**: And this gives you the opportunity to schedule someone to be by at the DOB on the 21st.
**Jdawson**: So it'll be overnighted on Friday.
**Jdawson**: It should be there by Saturday.
**Jdawson**: So when you go in on Monday on the 21st, if possible, that.
**Jdawson**: That's when you'll see that the sets there and they'll assign a permit number and allow you guys to file the permits.
**Jdawson**: And then basically the clock starts ticking for the review, which is typically two to three weeks.
**Jdawson**: But they.
**Jdawson**: Based off of the plans examiner and the relationship we built over the past few months, they're able to turn around permits within four days to one week.
**Jdawson**: So we're.
**Jdawson**: We have.
**Jdawson**: We have some flexibility, but as long as all the information is obviously accurate, signed and sealed with all the calculations.
**Jdawson**: Now between.
**Jdawson**: I'm sorry, but just between the issuance.
**Jdawson**: So between 418 or 421 and gathering permits, Yusuke wanted us to try to crank out as many shop drawings as possible.
**Jdawson**: This way, when we start mobilization mid May, we would be able to hit the ground running right away.
**Jdawson**: I'm sorry, Joe, go ahead.
**Bclymer**: No, I just wanted to comment on the.
**Bclymer**: On the.
**Bclymer**: The drawings.
**Bclymer**: So I expect them back this week.
**Bclymer**: To be honest.
**Bclymer**: The thing about it is the.
**Bclymer**: I can't.
**Bclymer**: I have to go through my engineer.
**Bclymer**: But they.
**Bclymer**: They.
**Bclymer**: He's never mailed them.
**Bclymer**: Like, if I send you the, the.
**Bclymer**: The official stamped PDFs, are you able to print these out?
**Bclymer**: I mean, they're.
**Bclymer**: They are sealed.
**Bclymer**: You know, like you can't change them.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Yeah, we can print them out.
**Daisuke.mine**: I mean, as long as.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Which.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: I.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: I mean, Jesse, I know you talked to Eileen at the city.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: They're okay with that.
**Daisuke.mine**: It doesn't have to be a wet stamp.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: It does not have to be a wet stamp, but it just needs.
**Jdawson**: So we did electronic sign and seal and we plotted.
**Jdawson**: That's what I.
**Jdawson**: To the dob.
**Jdawson**: And they said, yeah, that's completely fine.
**Bclymer**: I expect.
**Bclymer**: I expect to have those PDFs to you this week.
**Jdawson**: So can we still plot and ship over, or do you want to send still a link over to the Aliato team and then they'll print it?
**Bclymer**: I.
**Bclymer**: I don't think it matters who prints it.
**Bclymer**: It doesn't matter to us.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And they're.
**Bclymer**: They're.
**Bclymer**: They're.
**Bclymer**: They're signed and PE stamped and like, whoever wants to print them out and take them wherever they need be.
**Bclymer**: I mean, I could.
**Bclymer**: I could distribute it to whoever is needed, but I was promised we'd have them back this week.
**Bclymer**: As far as mailing them and stuff, this is a local, smaller guy who team who does this, but I don't.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I don't think they have the huge printers to, you know, go over all of that and get that all out and roll it up and send it out.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Yeah, we'll.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: We'll just print it that way we're.
**Daisuke.mine**: Not waiting and then get lost in the mail and just.
**Jdawson**: All right, so then on the 21st, Brandon, your team will have Exotex set printed with their calculations, and then we'll have everything shipped directly to the dob.
**Jdawson**: Or do you want me to ship them directly to you and then you just kind of walk them in?
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: I mean, what it will probably do.
**Daisuke.mine**: Since we're doing it, we have another one of these systems right here in Burnville, Pennsylvania, that we're out here doing right now.
**Daisuke.mine**: So the 21st, Jesse, I'm thinking that we just send them to Jack and have Jack take them.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Yeah, that's pretty close to buy there, so we can do that.
**Daisuke.mine**: Yeah.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So, Ahmed, we'll send you the address.
**Daisuke.mine**: For the hotel that our guy has.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: And then just shift from there, and.
**Daisuke.mine**: Then we'll take care.
**Bclymer**: Awesome.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: All right, so.
**Jdawson**: So those are the.
**Jdawson**: The primary dates that Yusuke is really trying to hit when it comes to starting and shop drawings and mobilization.
**Jdawson**: So given this information, I don't know how quick it is for.
**Jdawson**: For you.
**Jdawson**: For you, Brandon, and the team to kind of whip up a construction schedule based off of that.
**Daisuke.mine**: So.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So yeah, we can.
**Daisuke.mine**: I mean, we can work on the schedule.
**Daisuke.mine**: The biggest driver for all of this is the Exotech system, because we can get drawings, you know, approved in three.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Weeks and be ready to start in June.
**Daisuke.mine**: But if they're not standing up rack and until September, you know, we're going.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: To be well ahead of them and.
**Daisuke.mine**: Just kind of sitting there.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So, you know, the biggest driver is.
**Daisuke.mine**: The longest duration, which is that racking install.
**Daisuke.mine**: So really taking that duration and that and then building on the front and back side of that is where we have to start.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And that's, and that's why I wanted to have this call definitely to, to discuss those dates as of this moment.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, like you said, the two big drivers are, are actually three drivers are going to be one.
**Bclymer**: I don't know if you guys are aware of the, the move in the warehouse for the sublease that's going to be on Uniqlo's scope.
**Bclymer**: They, they are taking up some space of where we will be building rack.
**Bclymer**: So we do need to get that moved.
**Bclymer**: And then step two is definitely going to be the floor remed.
**Bclymer**: And then step three, of course start bringing in the racking and putting it up.
**Bclymer**: And then I know you have other scope sprinkled into there as well as far as, you know, pulling power and water and things of that nature.
**Bclymer**: So I just, I wanted us to kind of get a tentative plan together.
**Bclymer**: I know we do have a little room here, but I want to make sure that we're all aware that it is going to be, you know, we need two, we need like a week for the survey and then we need, you know, another two to three weeks with the floor remediation, depending on what the, how the survey comes back.
**Bclymer**: So I want to make sure we're not getting in each other's way.
**Daisuke.mine**: What's your, I can't remember.
**Daisuke.mine**: Joe, what's your ff?
**Bclymer**: I, I don't, I, I, that's going to be an engineer question like I don't have in front of me.
**Bclymer**: But they're, they're coming out, they're coming out to quote, I believe we wanna, the current schedule is to have Cogri.
**Bclymer**: Who's gonna be doing it.
**Bclymer**: They're gonna be, they're gonna be out there.
**Bclymer**: We're planning for like the first week of May is, that's right.
**Bclymer**: Is okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: That's when they're, that's when they're gonna.
**Daisuke.mine**: Survey it or that's when they're going to survey.
**Bclymer**: That's their survey.
**Daisuke.mine**: So if they are surveying the first week of May, let's say that May.
**Bclymer**: 5.
**Joseph.burdzy**: When you say floor mitigation, so are they Changing some of the rack legs or are they actually coming in and try to fix the floor?
**Bclymer**: No, they're.
**Bclymer**: They're grinding and making the floor flat.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Yeah, they'll grind off the first, the.
**Daisuke.mine**: Top 2 inches and then come in and make it like.
**Daisuke.mine**: Like, I think they need like, like 80, 85 FFL Miller or something.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Like.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Okay.
**Daisuke.mine**: So, Joe, so yeah, we're gonna say May 5th survey.
**Daisuke.mine**: When are you thinking grinding?
**Daisuke.mine**: Is that the first week of June or is.
**Bclymer**: Okay, were you thinking June or sooner?
**John.min**: I'm thinking within June and then like within June before starting Iraq installation at.
**John.min**: At the latest, but I'm thinking mid.
**John.min**: Within June.
**Bclymer**: Rack rack is not starting until August.
**Daisuke.mine**: What's your actual data right now?
**Bclymer**: Right now, the first delivery date is for August 1st.
**Daisuke.mine**: August 1st.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So you're going to shake it out.
**Daisuke.mine**: You're going to start standing up on the 11th, correct.
**Bclymer**: We hope.
**Bclymer**: We hope within the first four days to start standing.
**Bclymer**: You know, start standing, some racking.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Okay.
**Daisuke.mine**: And then, so I say like, and then, Joe, is there anything that you're waiting on design wise?
**Bclymer**: Design wise?
**Bclymer**: I, I don't.
**Bclymer**: I mean, we're not, we're not waiting anything on anything.
**Bclymer**: We're kind of waiting to see if you guys do anything from us, to be honest.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Yeah, I mean, we'll.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: We always just, you know, we're going.
**Daisuke.mine**: To take your, your flattened drawings and, and everything and put our fabrication on together.
**Daisuke.mine**: I just wanted to make sure that your stuff is already in production so that these dates were very solid.
**Bclymer**: Oh, yeah, no, we're.
**Bclymer**: We're ordered.
**Bclymer**: We're ahead of our lead time.
**Bclymer**: So, you know, pending that.
**Bclymer**: There's no.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: You better be careful about saying that, Joe.
**Bclymer**: I'm knocking on.
**Bclymer**: I'm knocking on wood now.
**Bclymer**: Trust me, I, I know it.
**Bclymer**: I know it.
**Bclymer**: But as of now, you know, this is, this is the schedule that we're looking at.
**Joseph.burdzy**: So.
**Daisuke.mine**: So suddenly a boat just sank in the Pacific.
**Bclymer**: Well, the good news is I think we're getting it.
**Bclymer**: We're.
**Bclymer**: We're going to be.
**Bclymer**: We're going to start sourcing local.
**Bclymer**: So that's, that's good news.
**Daisuke.mine**: Everybody's going to have to.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Daisuke.mine**: So, all right, so you're standing.
**Daisuke.mine**: We're going to start standing up on the 11th.
**Daisuke.mine**: What is your duration?
**Daisuke.mine**: The first module.
**Daisuke.mine**: Call it a.
**Bclymer**: We're going.
**Bclymer**: And I don't know, can everybody see my screen if we just want to run through this real quick?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I can see Just, just so everybody can get a look at as what we're.
**Bclymer**: What we're talking about here.
**Bclymer**: I have.
**Bclymer**: Sorry, I have an alarm going off here, and I don't know what it is.
**Bclymer**: Sorry about that.
**Bclymer**: So here's the Skypod system laying out in there.
**Bclymer**: This is kind of just a brief overview of.
**Bclymer**: We wanted to start Sky.
**Bclymer**: You know, of course, Skypod A, Skypod B.
**Bclymer**: We want to start from the top, right to left and then down.
**Bclymer**: So this is kind of going to be the installation sequence as we're doing one complete one, move over to two, start doing the conveyor up top and then finish up, you know.
**Bclymer**: And this is kind of going to be jumbled around just a little bit, as you see later.
**Bclymer**: But we do have some leeway with the.
**Bclymer**: With the end of it.
**Bclymer**: So to start off, I put these in basically two week spans.
**Bclymer**: August 4th to the 15th, obviously, we're going to be bringing in.
**Bclymer**: That's something else I wanted to bring up to start.
**Bclymer**: All equipment will be unloaded.
**Bclymer**: There's docks on the north and the south, but we're only going to be unloading from the north to start.
**Bclymer**: We want to unload from the north gate pretty much as much as possible until we get this first row done on the second rack.
**Bclymer**: And we have to come in from the south.
**Bclymer**: Like, we want that to be just the.
**Bclymer**: Because they're gonna keep.
**Bclymer**: Uniglo is keeping the area down below as a walkway.
**Bclymer**: And once we start unloading from the south dock, we're gonna have to stop traffic and maybe do a little reorganization there.
**Bclymer**: So I try to make this as simple as possible.
**Bclymer**: Every two weeks, how many racks we can get done.
**Bclymer**: We're looking at roughly three rows a week.
**Bclymer**: Sorry, two rows a week.
**Bclymer**: So in the first two.
**Bclymer**: First two weeks, we're looking at three rows.
**Bclymer**: One week.
**Bclymer**: You know, one week of unloading, or I'm misspoke speaking here.
**Bclymer**: First two weeks, we hope to have three rows up.
**Bclymer**: Second two weeks, three rows up.
**Bclymer**: Just start.
**Bclymer**: Start slow, and then we hope to be.
**Bclymer**: Get up to two rows a week.
**Bclymer**: That's.
**Bclymer**: That's.
**Bclymer**: That's the sweet spot.
**Daisuke.mine**: So what's the total duration?
**Bclymer**: Total duration for racking until March of next year.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: That's.
**Daisuke.mine**: That's both of them.
**Daisuke.mine**: Or that's.
**Daisuke.mine**: That's.
**Bclymer**: That's.
**Bclymer**: That's both of them.
**Daisuke.mine**: What's the.
**Daisuke.mine**: What's the personal ones?
**Bclymer**: Sorry, you're breaking up.
**Bclymer**: Say that again.
**Daisuke.mine**: So what about the first one?
**Bclymer**: More time.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Daisuke.mine**: Brandon, when is the first one supposed to finish?
**Daisuke.mine**: The first rack section?
**Bclymer**: The first rack we're looking at.
**Daisuke.mine**: Yeah, the entire first.
**Bclymer**: First week of November 7th immediately start immediately.
**Bclymer**: Start on the next rack.
**Bclymer**: Of course, I broke some of these down.
**Bclymer**: I know we have holidays coming up, so I gave a little leeway here.
**Bclymer**: This one's only one week and so that's.
**Daisuke.mine**: You said March, what, 16th.
**Bclymer**: Till the end to the beginning of March.
**Bclymer**: So the racking gets done.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, the racking gets done right here.
**Bclymer**: Basically March 1st, you can mark and then we still have others here.
**Bclymer**: But that.
**Bclymer**: That has nothing to do with the sprinklers or anything.
**Bclymer**: This is all our scope.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Yeah.
**Daisuke.mine**: So that's the driver V1, that's March.
**Daisuke.mine**: Okay.
**Daisuke.mine**: Then you have all your commissioning and stuff.
**Daisuke.mine**: Can you send me this, by the way?
**Bclymer**: Yes, yes, absolutely.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Do you commissioning in here?
**Bclymer**: No, I don't have my commissioning built into here.
**Bclymer**: That is going to be actually on.
**Bclymer**: That will be on the Microsoft project that I have.
**Bclymer**: But I wanted to get any additional dates from you that I can add into this, so we can all be, you know, so I'll at least have one completely complete schedule that we're all kind of at least going off of.
**Daisuke.mine**: Yeah, no, I agree.
**Daisuke.mine**: So, yeah, so if you do send me those two pieces, we'll input all of our data.
**Daisuke.mine**: So looking at, you know, obviously sprinkler for our duration, I mean, we'll be able to hit basically when you're done at the first one and starting on the second one, it won't be any issue for us to hit that timeline.
**Daisuke.mine**: And then in reality, second one.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: It.
**Daisuke.mine**: Must be done by May.
**Bclymer**: March.
**Jdawson**: March 1st.
**Daisuke.mine**: No, that's when you're done.
**Daisuke.mine**: The whole project's not gonna be done March.
**Bclymer**: Oh, yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: No, the whole project will be done until.
**Bclymer**: Yes, much later.
**Bclymer**: So our ending.
**Bclymer**: Our ending date is going to be.
**Bclymer**: I mean, our Go live.
**Bclymer**: I don't have the commissioning.
**Bclymer**: This is just simply an install that I put together here.
**Bclymer**: But yes, our commissioning, our official provisional acceptance, which is the first Go live, is going to be November 22nd.
**Daisuke.mine**: Of the 20.
**Bclymer**: I'm sorry, what am I looking at here?
**Bclymer**: This is June, July, August, August, August 23, 2026.
**Daisuke.mine**: Yeah, you sent me a contract, some more done in May.
**Bclymer**: So installation.
**Bclymer**: Installation will be done in May.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Yeah, but.
**Daisuke.mine**: But we still have obviously, commissioning, testing, all that stuff.
**Daisuke.mine**: So go live is August 23rd.
**Daisuke.mine**: So we need to go back from that.
**Daisuke.mine**: And, you know, in reality, I mean, we can knock one of these out 10 weeks.
**Bclymer**: We'll definitely be commissioning Skypod B before.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Yes, yeah, yeah.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: As soon as we're done there, you guys are going to bounce back.
**Daisuke.mine**: Yes, yeah, so I'm just thinking like so if we get started in, in the second, March, April, May to knock that regularize so that be June also simultaneously be working on all the conveyor, doing that the only thing.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So then what we'll do is we.
**Daisuke.mine**: Need to build back.
**Daisuke.mine**: Jesse and I will build this into your schedule.
**Daisuke.mine**: Joe and I'll tie it in so we'll, we'll pull in the stuff that we have to do which is going to be the lighting.
**Daisuke.mine**: The plumbing realistically can, can go at the same time as everything else.
**Daisuke.mine**: It's really just the lighting that has to go in the area where you're going to be going.
**Daisuke.mine**: And so if you're not standing up until August, probably going to be starting power I would say in July.
**Daisuke.mine**: Jesse, what do you think?
**Daisuke.mine**: I would think like July 1st.
**Joseph.burdzy**: We also, we also have beads and those transformers, they're kind of out in those areas so would want them to get started.
**Joseph.burdzy**: And you're saying that start up in August?
**Joseph.burdzy**: Yeah, maybe like even in June if we could get started.
**Joseph.burdzy**: They can like once they get in there plus with the price, materials and everything, they want to just get in there, get all that, the main conduits installed and in there just so they can, you know, procure them immediately and get that work done.
**Daisuke.mine**: At least get it on site in our lay down area.
**Daisuke.mine**: Hey Joe.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Yeah.
**Daisuke.mine**: Don't get mad at me, but let's just say because it's more memco that possibly.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Cool.
**Bclymer**: Say that again.
**Bclymer**: Brandon.
**Bclymer**: I'm having a hard time.
**Bclymer**: It might be me, I don't know.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, you keep cutting in and out.
**John.min**: Can hear correctly?
**John.min**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Not exactly.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Can you hear me better now?
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Hello?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, that's better.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Okay, cool.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: I said, I said Joe, don't shoot me.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: But what about additional manpower?
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Is that at all on the, on the radar at all to increase the or decrease the duration of the racking standup?
**Bclymer**: I, it, it's something of course in the back of our minds but you know, with how the schedule was laid out, it's.
**Bclymer**: I, I can't even if we finish sooner, we don't want to have a lull of.
**Bclymer**: We don't have commissioners available to commission the project.
**Bclymer**: And then also as you were saying earlier, racking is, is not always accurate when they're going to deliver, you know, so we don't want to kind of over promise and you know, if we have two crews out there and no equipment, we're kind of shooting ourselves in the foot.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Yeah, no, I just wanted to pose the question so we'll just.
**Bclymer**: If we fall.
**Bclymer**: If we fall behind, of course, but.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Oh, yeah, if you fall behind, all of a sudden you.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: All of a sudden, three crews free up.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Yeah.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: It's crazy.
**Bclymer**: It's a very.
**Bclymer**: It is a generous schedule.
**Bclymer**: And, you know, we are.
**Bclymer**: We are trying to do our best to save kind of that.
**Bclymer**: That buffer that we do have, because, you know, maybe we can take some extra time during the holidays or something.
**Bclymer**: I don't know.
**Bclymer**: But we definitely want to get it done.
**Bclymer**: It's just a matter of, you know, getting a lot of this equipment over, and that's.
**Bclymer**: It's been quite the challenge lately.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Yeah, no, I get that.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: All right, well, so, I mean, those are the important dates.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Like, we've got that locked in so, you know, we can build off of that schedule.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Jesse, do you have any questions for Joe or anything?
**Joseph.burdzy**: I think I'm good.
**Joseph.burdzy**: I just need to, like, we got all the dates.
**Joseph.burdzy**: We'll just put our activities and get them scheduled in.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Yeah, so we'll.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: We'll put our activities in there and get that baked in and all into one, one seamless schedule.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Joe, send us the PowerPoint in your schedule so we can see all that.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: And then we'll insert and tie everything together and have a master schedule for everybody.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Okay.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: ZK do you have any questions?
**John.min**: Yeah, Joe, thank you for explaining the installation of sprinkler part.
**John.min**: But I also want to confirm not only for the sprinkler part, but to the sprinkler.
**John.min**: Like, we have to do some works before starting the rackings.
**John.min**: Installation of the racking.
**John.min**: Right.
**John.min**: For example, putting the electrical cable to the Skypod area.
**John.min**: And also we have to build some.
**John.min**: Right.
**John.min**: Like riser to Skypod area.
**John.min**: We have to do such work before starting rack installation.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Yeah, so that's what.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So the electrical part is what Jesse was talking about.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Our guys will probably get in there in, like, June time frame.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: As far as this, as far as the sprinkler, we'll run those mains overhead and stuff as.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: As it gets closer.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: We won't actually build the riser assembly until the end of it, like you will.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: It will come down and build that last.
**John.min**: Oh, so riser will be done at last.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Yeah, the riser assembly, which is the part on the wall that you see now, the main, what's called what we call bulk pipe, we'll get in there and run that early.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So, like, for instance, you know, as.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: As they're standing up that rack.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So let's say, I mean, probably three or four weeks before they finish the racking, we will go in there and start running our bulk main, which is what feeds the entire system from the pump room.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Now there's a couple overhead lines that, that, that go overhead.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Now we don't want to put those in before because it's too, it's too close and you know, accidents happen and we don't want Joe's guys to hit that pipe.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: And so our pipe is on the edge of their rack.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: And so we always come in with that.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: At.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: After they stand their rack up, we come with our overheads.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: The bulk will run like at the same time, but our bulk will run way faster than what they stand up rack.
**John.min**: Okay, so understand.
**John.min**: So how about what.
**John.min**: We have to finish adding the light before rack starts, right?
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Yeah.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So that's part of that electrical package that Jesse referenced.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: It'll be in like, call it July time frame, June time frame.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: We'll get in there and we'll do whatever lighting demo and everything that we have to do.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: And then we'll, we'll get in.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: And so that's where.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: When it, when it comes to the actual new lights that go in those aisles, that's where it takes a lot of coordination between Joe's guys and our guys.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Because even though the drawing may say one thing, whenever they get out there and lay out this racking there, it may, something may, may land on a control joint or, you know, a columns wonky or something.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: And so they may adjust that rack 3, 4 inches, whichever way to make it work.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: And then they'll lay the whole thing out from there.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: And so we have to, we want to wait until they're ready to lay it out so that our lights line up.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So that'll be done simultaneously.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: We'll work with them.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: They'll lay it out and then we'll snap.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: As soon as they snap their lines, we'll go in there and we'll snap all our lights to where they go before rack starts.
**John.min**: Right?
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: They'll start, they'll be, there's.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: When they start racking, like there's a little, there's some prep work.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Basically that first week when they're shaking that stuff out, his foreman will lay out the rack.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: He'll lay lines on.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: When he lays that out, that's when we'll be doing the lighting stuff and we'll be ahead of them.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: We'll be, you know, three rows ahead of them.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: They'll never catch us.
**John.min**: Okay.
**John.min**: Okay.
**John.min**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yuk.
**Bclymer**: I don't, I don't know if we've ever really gone over that part.
**Bclymer**: But the week before we start the racking, or it might even be the week that everything starts getting delivered, somebody's going to come out and mark up the floors.
**Bclymer**: So they're going to come out there with their robot system and literally draw where all the anchors are going to be.
**Bclymer**: So, you know, once, once it's laid out on the floor, that's where we're going to be and that's where, where Brandon's team can, can really see without just going off of, you know, laser lines that.
**Bclymer**: Where everything is going to be.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Yeah.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Zuki.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: The one thing that people, you know, if you don't build buildings, you don't realize nothing, and I mean nothing is ever exactly what the drawing shows.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So we've done this enough times to where we know exactly what to do, to where we're not going back and redoing it, because you would be pissed.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Is if we hang those lights and it's 4 inches off center and you're like, this looks terrible.
**John.min**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Okay, Joe, I had a quick question about the fire alarm.
**Jdawson**: In an event there is a fire and the alarm in the building goes off, does the Skypod system turn down?
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Yeah.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So there's two contactors that land in his main control panel.
**Jdawson**: Got it.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Which actually, you'll have two.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: You'll have two control panels, right, Joe?
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Two individual.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Two independent ones.
**Bclymer**: Yes, because we have two.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, two sky pods.
**Bclymer**: There'll be two control panels.
**Bclymer**: That's something we were actually discussing yesterday.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Yeah, it'll be like, it'll be four, like four relays.
**Bclymer**: Is that, is that something, is that a wire that you're pulling or is that something we need to get the fire department to do or the, whoever manages the fire?
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: I'd have to look at what our.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: I know we put, I think we put an allowance in there for fire alarm because I know it has to be done.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So unless, unless for some reason, you know, if, if the UNICO team has a certain fire alarm vendor, maybe they have a contract or something, we put an allowance, I think, in our, in our, in our proposal for it.
**Bclymer**: And those are just, those are just copper lines, right?
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Not copper.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: It's a fire alarm relay line.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So it's a low, it's a low voltage line.
**John.min**: So Brandon, is, is it okay, I share you the information of our, like, fire alarm bender to you and.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Yeah, certainly.
**John.min**: Control by yourself.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Yeah, certainly.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Yep.
**John.min**: I'll inform you later.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And, and while, and while we're on the topic of power and stuff.
**Bclymer**: I know.
**Bclymer**: Again, we had a call yesterday kind of just going over a few things and I know there was some confusion, Yuzuk, with the electrical.
**Bclymer**: Just.
**Bclymer**: Just to be clear, we do have this designed for eight.
**Bclymer**: Eight drops, just like you have here.
**Bclymer**: Yes, right.
**Bclymer**: They.
**Bclymer**: They are going to be.
**Bclymer**: They aren't actually the sky Pod ones.
**Bclymer**: The triangles are going to be in the same spot.
**Bclymer**: But we are just.
**Bclymer**: The diagram probably looked different yesterday because.
**Bclymer**: Because based on how the team wants.
**Bclymer**: Basically based on how the team wants the emergency stop set up and things, this had to be moved around just a little bit.
**Bclymer**: It's still the same number of drops.
**Bclymer**: But we won't help.
**Bclymer**: We won't have the exact look the exact locations until the.
**Bclymer**: Until the studies is complete.
**John.min**: So when will be the finishing date of the study phase?
**Jdawson**: May.
**John.min**: Okay.
**John.min**: So, Ahmed, what should we do for this one?
**John.min**: Actually, our design drawing is based on this drop location, right?
**Jdawson**: I'm not.
**Jdawson**: I'm not following.
**Jdawson**: What do you mean?
**John.min**: Like, we are doing our design based on this location.
**John.min**: This drop power drop location.
**Jdawson**: We're not showing any drop locations.
**Jdawson**: Everything is coordinated based off of the architecturals.
**Jdawson**: So if things need to shift left and right a few feet or a few inches, I'm not sure how that is impactful.
**Jdawson**: We received the final layout and we incorporated the exact background.
**Jdawson**: Joe.
**Jdawson**: So then we're not really trying to finagle with stretching the fencing and whatnot.
**Jdawson**: So we're complementing exactly what is shown now from Exotic's latest layout, where the transformers fall that is going to be shown on Henderson's and Exotic's plans.
**Jdawson**: Now, Joe, dropdowns wise, I see that we're looking at a.
**Jdawson**: At a screenshot that's just based off of the sky path and the Skypod area.
**Jdawson**: Is there any other deep downs that are happening for the transform?
**Jdawson**: I'm sorry, for the compressor.
**Jdawson**: Any other drop downs that are going to be happening?
**Jdawson**: Because the impression there's only eight, but I believe there's more than eight because I'm looking at the engineering drawings and I see a bunch of TE1s and TE2s and they seem to be drop downs.
**Bclymer**: So yes, there's definitely going to need to be power and by the compressor.
**Bclymer**: Yes, this is just for the sky path.
**Bclymer**: This is just for our requirements of what we need for the actual system.
**Bclymer**: And this does not have.
**Bclymer**: This does not show where, you know, you do need power.
**Bclymer**: That's going to be by the.
**Bclymer**: Obviously by the compressors and then in.
**Bclymer**: And I'm definitely.
**Bclymer**: I'M not an engine.
**Bclymer**: Not electrical enough to savvy to talk on that.
**Bclymer**: But these are the only spots where we're going to need the power handed off from.
**Jdawson**: As it relates to the Skypath and the skypods only.
**Bclymer**: Correct.
**Jdawson**: And so this is only.
**Bclymer**: Pull from there.
**Jdawson**: Got it.
**Jdawson**: So, Yusuke, this is.
**Jdawson**: This image that you have on the screen is only for the Skypod.
**Jdawson**: And Skypath does not revolve around what's happening along the perimeters for those drop down.
**John.min**: Yeah, yeah, I understand it.
**John.min**: But as I see from Joe Joe's screen yesterday, there is like numbers of drops are kind of different.
**John.min**: Like for example, the Norse conveyor drop was only one, but south conveyor drop was three.
**John.min**: So I was confused.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, so.
**Bclymer**: So what we did is we.
**Bclymer**: We.
**Bclymer**: We were able to use all the power, put it into one location on the top, and then we wanted to utilize that and bring it to the bottom again.
**Bclymer**: The four for the Sky Pod are.
**Bclymer**: These are pretty much set in stone.
**Bclymer**: The ones that go that are for the Sky Path power boxes.
**Jdawson**: They're.
**Bclymer**: They're still kind of.
**Bclymer**: We do need four of them.
**Bclymer**: They're just.
**Bclymer**: They're not.
**Bclymer**: We don't have the final resting place of them yet.
**John.min**: Okay, but we have to drop there for the table, right?
**John.min**: We don't have to.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Well, no, the table drops that you're talking about are the workstations, right, Yuzuk?
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Is that what you're talking about?
**John.min**: No, the blue one in the screen.
**John.min**: The blue dots.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, those will be boxes.
**John.min**: So we have to fix those location, isn't it?
**John.min**: Before going to do or something?
**John.min**: No, we don't.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: They can adjust.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: I mean, you can.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So in our.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: In Henderson's drawings, they're going to show locations, right?
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So everybody says, hey, this is what our plan is.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: However, during the course of construction, if we have to adjust something, it's simply a revision.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So we adjust it, and then we'll submit those changes to the city as a revision.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: It's not like one.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: It's not like once we submit it, it's set in stone.
**John.min**: Okay.
**John.min**: Okay.
**John.min**: So we can just incorporate those changes after we submit to dob, correct?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, towards the end of Suitcase.
**Jdawson**: So then we can.
**Jdawson**: So at the end of the project, we can submit the PAA sets to the dob.
**John.min**: Okay.
**John.min**: Okay.
**John.min**: And then those updates will be fixed in May, right?
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Joe better have them before then.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I'll have them.
**Bclymer**: I'll have them by the end of this month.
**Bclymer**: Month?
**Bclymer**: I'm hoping to have them sooner.
**John.min**: Okay.
**John.min**: Okay.
**John.min**: Then we have to revise the drawing and submit to DOB again?
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: No, we're gonna go ahead.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, but it doesn't affect your permit, you suke, if that's what you're worried about, you'll have your permits like right now.
**Jdawson**: Whatever we're going into with dob, that gets you the, the go ahead to start the work.
**Jdawson**: If there's anything that shifts a little bit here and there, like exit signs or the transformer locations, whatever it is, we can adjust that accordingly in the field, ensure that it's compliant.
**Jdawson**: And then at the end of the project, when we're ready to before ready to be ready to sign off, we'll file a PAA right away and get that all approved and documented.
**John.min**: Okay.
**John.min**: Okay.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: What other questions do you have?
**John.min**: Yeah, let me just summarize the overall schedule.
**John.min**: The first one, sublease move like we fixed, we already fixed the sublease move and they were moving and they're like keeping our Skybot area before, like within April.
**John.min**: So we can start floor survey from May 1st and then we can like do some flow remediation within June.
**John.min**: We didn't exactly fix the schedule for remediation yet, but within June and between those floor survey and floor remediation you can.
**John.min**: No, no, wait.
**John.min**: After finishing the floor survey, Eliato could start work.
**John.min**: For example, electric cable pulling, putting the cable from electrical house work and such kind of work we have to do before rack installation starts.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Yes, we'll start some, some electrical work probably in June, July, time frame, whatever makes makes the most sense.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Duration wise and material wise.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: We obviously have to get through some submittals and things like that.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So you know, May is going to be a little, little tough to get that done.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: We still have to get contracts and everything and get stuff ordered, submittal process, you know, whatnot.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So you know, I think June, mid June to July is a more realistic timeframe because that electrical work is going to be going on concurrently anyway with, with the racking.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: The only real driver.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Like if you look at our critical path dates, that's going to be getting the lighting done in the aisles, which is going to follow as soon as Joe's guys lay everything out.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Then we're going to have to get the lighting up above the racking and then the main critical path item from there is going to be standing up the rack and then the sprinkler falling behind that.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: And then the same thing with the other one.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: All the other items are, you know, can, can float back and forth because those durations, the racking and sprinkler are so long, everything else can fit in between.
**John.min**: Okay, but for cable pulling, we have to do before that, right?
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: No, no.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So our, our, our cables, can we.
**John.min**: Do that in, in parallel?
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Yes, we can do that in parallel because the only overhead work is just that lighting that's going to go there.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: And so we'll get that lighting and stuff done.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: But all of your mains, all the, all the main distribution panel that feed his, his stuff that feed his distribution that can be pulled concurrently because his control panels are going to be sitting outside the systems anyway.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So we can access it at any time.
**John.min**: How can we like minimize the cable route to dump before rock starts?
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So yeah, so we'll, we're gonna, I mean we're gonna take the most cost effective route there is possible.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: That's, that's because we don't want to spend any more money.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So we're going to take the most cost effective route.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So that's what Jesse was talking about.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: We may get in there early to pull some stuff overhead.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: I don't have that answer for you right there.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: I mean that's what our team will work out.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: But have no fear, we're going to, you know, pull the shortest, most cost effective distance for, for us.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: And whether that's going to be before the racking starts or concurrently, we'll figure that out.
**John.min**: Okay.
**John.min**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**John.min**: All right.
**John.min**: So.
**John.min**: Okay, I understand.
**John.min**: So Joe, are you, are you preparing some schedule based on the Microsoft project?
**John.min**: Right.
**John.min**: Is it possible to like put some into the like Share share folder or something?
**John.min**: And everybody.
**Bclymer**: Brandon and I are going to put something together.
**Bclymer**: I'm gonna, I'm gonna tidy up mine and then I'm gonna send it to them.
**Bclymer**: I have.
**Bclymer**: We work on a web based.
**Bclymer**: It's different for us internally here, so it takes me a little effort to export it and then once I get it back from Brandon, I have to incorporate it back into my.
**Bclymer**: It's.
**Bclymer**: I, I don't want to SharePoint to where it can be edited all over, but I do think there can definitely be a weekly, you know, schedule talk and things like that.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Yeah, well, yeah, Yuzuki will, you know, we'll, we'll work hand in hand with Joe.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: We've, we've done this enough with these guys.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So we'll put all our stuff into, into the master schedule and we'll have it.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: And so then we'll just.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: As we have these weekly meetings, here's the update here where things are sitting and so you'll be able to see where everything lands.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: It'll show your critical path, which is what drives your actual schedule.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: And so everything will be nice and neat.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: It's just that we have to come in and now input our data into Joe's.
**John.min**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**John.min**: So we can, we can have some like, weekly.
**John.min**: Weekly wise schedule.
**John.min**: Not weekly wise.
**John.min**: Like, we can have like, latest schedule once a week.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Yeah.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So you'll see exactly what's updated and you'll have your look ahead, any kind of issues.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So we'll, we'll have a standing call every week where we're going through things and see, hey, like, if anything's slipping, what is it, how do we make it up, what issues, what open items, everything like that.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So that's what we'll cover in these calls every week.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: And so, but you know, Joe, Joe's team and our team, we work hand in hand to make sure that everybody's on the same page.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: And we're all, you know, getting this thing done as efficiently as possible.
**John.min**: Okay.
**John.min**: Okay.
**John.min**: And I want to know the sequence of this work.
**John.min**: So Joe, can you share those PowerPoint slide to Brandon?
**John.min**: And Brandon, can you add some, like, prep work before?
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Yeah.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So Joe will.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Joe will share all the slides and everything.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: And so we'll get all our stuff figured out and then we'll have our, we'll have our site logistics plan.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: And then so we'll have our, our, our things, like whatever our tasks are in the schedule.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So you can say, okay, here we go.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Like in June, they're going to be running power here, and then and July, they're going to be doing this and so on and so forth.
**John.min**: Okay.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: And Yuzuki, like, you know, this is a.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: We're gonna be doing this for a year together.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: We're gonna know each other pretty well.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: If there's certain things that you want to see, especially because you, you.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: We all have bosses.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Right.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: And if there's like, hey, this.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: I need to see something this way because I got a report or whatever you want to do, just let us know and Joe and I will make sure it happens.
**John.min**: Okay.
**John.min**: Okay.
**John.min**: Thank you very much.
**John.min**: Okay.
**John.min**: I'm good.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Okay, great.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: I'm at.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Anything else?
**Bclymer**: No, I think we're good.
**Jdawson**: We're all going to aim for the 17th to ship out.
**Jdawson**: So we'll ship out Aue Henderson's and TPG's drawings directly to whatever address Jesse or you are going to send us.
**Jdawson**: And then Joe is going to send out three sign and sealed exotic drawings along with their calculations.
**Jdawson**: And then we submit hopefully by the 21st.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Yep.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: And then Joe, make sure I know you sent some emails, but just make sure that you send me the latest flattened DWG file.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So whatever that the comment said, that we're going with the latest DWG file.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: I know that you were working on some stuff for the.
**Jdawson**: I got you Joe, I got you.
**Jdawson**: So I'm going to send it to you.
**Jdawson**: I'm sorry Joe, we're going to send it to you just to confirm that we plugged in exactly in the right location.
**Jdawson**: Once you confirm it, it'll have PDF in progress.
**Jdawson**: PDFs for you, Brandon, as well as the DWGs with the entire site on.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Okay, great.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: And then, and then I'm assuming Henderson is finishing up their design this week, right?
**Jdawson**: Correct?
**Jdawson**: Yes, they should be done by the 17th and they should have everything shipped over to TPG's office by the 18th.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Okay, cool.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: That way they send me that, we'll review it, make sure there's no nothing glaring and then we'll go.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Oh Yuzuke, one thing I need to ask you.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Are you going to have.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So you obviously this is a FM project.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: You're insured by FM Global, correct?
**John.min**: For the sprinkler, right?
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: No, no, FM Global is insurance company.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So FM.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Yeah, so FM Global is an insurance company.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So FM Global 8:34 which is the guideline for ASRs sprinkler is just a standard that people follow.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: But your insurance company.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So a lot of times when we like for instance we're another job, one of these we're doing right now, the insurance company, this is for civil logistics.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So their insurance company does a review of a new building and it's like an audit to see what their insurance rate is.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So are you guys going to do that for your building?
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Because if so we need to make sure we get that insurance person's buy in because they're going to make certain recommendations and then they're going to say if you follow this recommendation, your insurance rate is this and if you don't it's this.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: And so you need to make a business decision because if they're like well if you add, you know, this, this and this, it'll save you this much.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: And then we're going to be like, well if you do that it's going to cost this.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So what decision do you want to make?
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So it's important that if you're going to have insurance review for this site, we know that early so we can figure out what their requirements are going to be and we can say here's the cost difference and Then they can tell you here's what you'll save and you can make a decision.
**John.min**: But we are following FM Global 8 dash what?
**Jdawson**: 30.
**John.min**: 30 something.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So FM 834 is just a guideline by FM Global.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: But what I'm saying is oftentimes with these new buildings or anything like that, whatever the client is that's taking that building when they get insurance, like when you're adding all this stuff, all this racking, your insurance rate is going to change.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So depending on who you have insurance with, a lot of times they'll come in and they'll say, hey, here's what we recommend and if we follow these recommendations, here is your rate.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: If you do not follow these recommendations, here's your rate.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So just because we're following FM guidelines, which is again a guideline like not a code, like it's still.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: It's just very important that if you are going to have an insurance survey, you want to get them on board early and have them review the drawings to make sure that they don't have any issues.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Because last thing you want to do is get to the end of the job and then they do an insurance survey and say, oh well wait, we wanted this, this and this.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: And now you're going to pay this for insurance.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So again, maybe you're not doing it.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: It's just something that is common with these builds.
**John.min**: Okay, but we, we can't change any like sprinkler or any like sprinkler design based on their comment as.
**John.min**: Because we are, we have to stick with FM Global 8 34.
**Bclymer**: Right?
**Jdawson**: Well, is that, is that what you've signed up for, Yusuke?
**Jdawson**: It's all based off of what you, what you're getting covered for.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Yeah, so.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So yeah, 8:34 is the guideline and if that's what you want to stick with.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: But like for instance, your insurance company, they may say like, okay, you followed your current Design which meets 8:34.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Your insurance is a million dollars a year.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: However, if you change to these heads, it's going to be a half a million dollars a year.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Like that's what I'm talking about.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Like the code doesn't matter.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: It's just more along the lines of what they're going to say insurance rate wise.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: And so it's just important for you as a business to say like, hey, we might spend a little bit more Cap X right now because our insurance rate over the next 10 years is going to go down by 10 or 20%.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Maybe.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: I have no idea.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Or maybe you're not doing a survey, but typically they're going to do an audit.
**John.min**: Okay, so you're proposing us to like get our audit before starting the construction.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: I'm not necessarily proposing you to do anything.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Again if this isn't on your radar, no problems.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: It's just a lot of times whenever you, you add products like this or you have a new building, then you have to get, you know, insurance and your insurance is going to want to look at all these things.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: They're going to want to review the drawings and they're going to say, well, we want to see this, this and this or whatever.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Or they may say it's perfectly fine, but my only caution is, is that if you wait till the end, then they may say, well, we really want to see this for XYZ reason and it could just save you money.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Or maybe it doesn't save you money, but it's worth the exercise because again, we've done this a time or two and I'm.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: And it's worth having their buy in now because they may have something small and stupid like, you know, oh, well, we want to see a fire department connection line on the exterior.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Like, okay, like who knows?
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: But it's just, it's important to have their, their feedback if you're, if you can do that, that.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: And that's why I asked who your insurance company was.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Which.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: This building is probably an FM Global building, I would say, but maybe not.
**John.min**: Yeah, yeah, it is.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Yeah.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So, so you have an FM Global rep and so you can reach out to them or whoever it is in your risk management department and I can walk you through this another time.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So nobody has a.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Listen to this.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: I know it's, it's nobody else's issue, but I've, I've helped a lot of clients through this, so I can help walk you through that, reaching out to your FM Global rep and say, hey, we're doing this system.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Can we get your blessing on what we're doing?
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Because we submit our drawings to the city and they're going to say, yep, it meets code.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Okay.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: But your insurance doesn't review it until you send it to them.
**John.min**: Okay.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So if you got more questions, let me know.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: I don't want to keep rambling on.
**Jdawson**: Brandon, just really quick, when we start shop drawings, what, what interface are we using?
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So we use Job Planner.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Are you familiar with that?
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: No, I'm not, but I'll figure it.
**Jdawson**: Out once you send me.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: It's, it's just like Procore, except cheaper.
**Jdawson**: Really?
**Jdawson**: What, what's it Called.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Called Job Planner.
**Jdawson**: Job Planner.
**Jdawson**: Got it.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Yeah.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: I'll send you.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: I'll send you a link for it.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And whenever you get that set up, just send out the invite to myself and, And.
**Jdawson**: And Ben.
**Jdawson**: But does it allow you to.
**Jdawson**: Where If.
**Jdawson**: If I review it, it goes.
**Jdawson**: It goes to the next discipline, or if Ben uses it, it goes to the next discipline, or does it have to go through.
**Jdawson**: If Ben uploads it, then I have to still review it.
**Jdawson**: Does it do that?
**Jdawson**: Tedious.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: It's just like Procore, where, like, I can set the progression.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So if, like, you know, submitter, review, review or whatever it is.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So we.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: We set the progression.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Perfect.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Jdawson**: I don't have any more questions, man.
**Jdawson**: This is perfect.
**Bclymer**: Thank you.

**John.min**: Did you say the goal live is August 23rd?
**Bclymer**: The Go Live is.
**John.min**: Wasn't it July?
**Bclymer**: Well, everything got pushed back one month because of the signing.
**John.min**: Also originally it was July 23rd, but because of the contract pushed one month later.
**John.min**: So it became August 23rd.
**Bclymer**: Correct.
**John.min**: Okay.
**John.min**: Okay.
**John.min**: I got message from minus on that.
**John.min**: He.

**Bclymer**: It shouldn't have been because they're.
**Bclymer**: They're in the notes here.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, this has been sent out quite a few times.
**Bclymer**: I'll put this in the chat.
**Bclymer**: So this is on all the notes, when I would send it and what we talked about originally.
**Bclymer**: We can go over the dates again, but provisional accepted.
**Bclymer**: Provisional acceptance.
**Bclymer**: Basically, when we start going live.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Is.
**Bclymer**: You know, the contract signed was.
**Bclymer**: The date in the contract was July 23rd.
**Bclymer**: And due to the contract being signed a month later, later than expected, every date was pushed out 30 days.
**John.min**: Okay, so does that.
**Bclymer**: Does that mean we can't pull it in a little bit if we get Ahead of schedule, by all means.
**Bclymer**: But I do want to.
**Bclymer**: I.
**Bclymer**: I do want to, like, set the precedent that we are looking at the 24th of August.

**Bclymer**: But.
**Bclymer**: And then when, when it was explained, it wasn't a concern at all.
**Bclymer**: It was just Ahmed saw something on the drawings that looked like something.
