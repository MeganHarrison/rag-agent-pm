## Transcript
**Ataylor**: Sa.
**Ataylor**: Hey, good afternoon, everyone.
**Brhoades**: Good afternoon.
**Ataylor**: We still waiting on some people to join.
**Ataylor**: Definitely wait on Eric.
**Ataylor**: Let's give it a few minutes.
**Brhoades**: Hey, Matt, I think Eric is on vacation.
**Brhoades**: He has a PTO day today.
**Brhoades**: Yeah, just checked it shows on his calendar and he's on pto.
**Brhoades**: So.
**Ataylor**: Sorry, I was on mute.
**Ataylor**: Are we waiting on anyone from the deem side?
**Ataylor**: Should AJ be on the call?
**Ataylor**: Oh, there it is.
**Ataylor**: Never mind.
**Dworsham**: Hey, guys.
**Dworsham**: Sorry I'm late.
**Ataylor**: Hey, Jay.
**Ataylor**: No problem.
**Ataylor**: All right, Anyone else that we need?
**Ataylor**: I think you said William.
**Ataylor**: I think that's how you pronounce his name.
**Ataylor**: Is your foreman.
**Ataylor**: Should he be on the call?
**Dworsham**: I.
**Dworsham**: I can get with William or Brennan.
**Dworsham**: Brennan and Robert.
**Ataylor**: Will.
**Dworsham**: So everybody's here.
**Dworsham**: I think that needs to be okay.
**Ataylor**: All right.
**Ataylor**: Sounds good.
**Ataylor**: Well, I mean, we're doing this thing tomorrow.
**Ataylor**: I want to talk about some timing.
**Ataylor**: So, first of all, Carrie is going to be the lead from our mechanical side.
**Ataylor**: So we're going to have a forklift on site and a scissor lift just in case we need it for some of our demo.
**Ataylor**: And we are good to start.
**Ataylor**: Radial said they will let us have it at about 2:30pm so that'll give us some extra time.
**Ataylor**: So does that work for you guys to start a little bit earlier?
**Ataylor**: I know last time we talked, we were talking about, like, 5:00pm.
**Dworsham**: Yeah.
**Dworsham**: I mean, we're gonna have guys on site, right, Robert?
**Dworsham**: So we can.
**Esetka**: Yeah, we'll.
**Esetka**: We'll be ready to unhook the power and then start disconnecting wires as soon as you guys tell us.
**Esetka**: Go.
**Ataylor**: Okay, cool.
**Ataylor**: How's the theater coming along for the new location?
**Esetka**: We have it piped up out of the panel, the box set.
**Esetka**: We're pulling the cable over now, so we'll have it in place probably sometime Saturday morning.
**Ataylor**: Beautiful.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: All right.
**Ataylor**: That sounds good.
**Ataylor**: Donnie, anything from your side that we need to double check before we shut this thing off?
**Brhoades**: Nothing I can think of.
**Brhoades**: I went over stuff with Eric yesterday.
**Brhoades**: Kim and I had a meeting, and looks like we're all good to go.
**Brhoades**: We stood up with the right version of PLC code.
**Brhoades**: It has copy of the drawings that I got when I was out there.
**Kriebe**: And now we went through them, and.
**Brhoades**: This part should be pretty easy.
**Brhoades**: I mean, it's.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Brhoades**: Disconnect everything from where it was and put it back where.
**Kriebe**: Where it used to be, so.
**Ataylor**: Right.
**Brhoades**: The question I have is, from the inside, do y' all have, like, what kind of labeling.
**Brhoades**: What kind of labels do y' all have for putting back on the wires.
**Esetka**: We'Ll just use a panda, like a Pandua type label or Brady labeler where.
**Brhoades**: You do it and then it has like a little wraparound self laminating style.
**Esetka**: I don't know exactly what they have out there, but we can get, I mean, if you can tell me now what you prefer, we can try to get it on site.
**Brhoades**: The existing ones are the kind where you print them out and then they have, they wrap around and have laminate, something like that.
**Kriebe**: Okay.
**Esetka**: Hey, one thing I'd like to make sure we have covered.
**Esetka**: Are you guys removing the control panel?
**Esetka**: Right, so we're going to unhook it.
**Esetka**: I think last week on the call I told you guys you're welcome to borrow a forklift if you needed.
**Esetka**: But yeah, I'm just making sure we're not going to have people there to move the cabinet.
**Esetka**: So you guys have that coverage.
**Dworsham**: Yep.
**Ataylor**: So Carrie's team will do that.
**Ataylor**: So we'll have our own forklift on site just in case.
**Ataylor**: And we're gonna, Carrie's gonna be there to do the rest of the demo.
**Ataylor**: Like the, to demo the, those legs that are still standing and help with some of the conduit demo.
**Ataylor**: Once you guys, you know, have us shut down and all that.
**Ataylor**: I mean, it'll be probably a collaborative effort to get that conduit down.
**Ataylor**: And then there's an incline still that we got to take out.
**Ataylor**: So we'll have our own equipment there, both forklift and scissor lift.
**Ataylor**: And we'll move the panel as well.
**Esetka**: Yeah, so we know where the breaker is feeding the panel.
**Esetka**: So I mean, it's going to be pretty quick work to get the, the breaker shut off and locked out.
**Esetka**: And then we'll, you know, I, I would, you know, venture to say a half hour we have the power out of there and then I don't know how many wires are landed in there like inputs and outputs, but I mean, what is there going to be?
**Esetka**: Maybe 100 wires we're talking about.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, something like that.
**Brhoades**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: And biggest thing is just to make sure you document very well on where everything is.
**Ataylor**: And I mean, maybe you don't even, I don't know.
**Ataylor**: How do you, how are you guys.
**Esetka**: Going to do it?
**Ataylor**: Are you going to cut wires and leave them terminated and label them on the other side of the cut or what's the plan?
**Esetka**: Yeah, I figured what we would do is open the panel, take, you know, a thousand pictures of everything, get it, you know, pictures, pictures, pictures.
**Esetka**: And then just unlay the wires, not cut Anything, not do anything with, you know, labeling.
**Esetka**: Just basically unland them and then, you know, gently get them out of the cabinet.
**Esetka**: So I don't know.
**Esetka**: I guess I don't know exactly what that pipe looks like going into the cabinet.
**Esetka**: If there's enough room where we just loosen the connector and we can pull the connector out, pull the lock ring off or something, and slide the pipe out and pull the wire out.
**Esetka**: Basically just get it out and let it hang there until the cabinets moved, and then we can start, I think, working.
**Esetka**: We're going to have to slide the pipe.
**Esetka**: So my plan was to slide the pipe all the way off the wire as we demo and work it back to where the new cabinet's going to have, you know, a thousand feet of wire hanging there.
**Esetka**: And then we just get the correct length, cut them then, and label them one at a time.
**Esetka**: So kind of get an idea of where the cabin is going to be, have a team there, have them all sitting there where they don't get knotted up, and then get, you know, maybe cut them 20ft longer than they need to be and re identify them one at a time.
**Esetka**: And then that's probably going to take all day, I imagine Saturday, and I figured Sunday, or maybe sometime Saturday, get a couple guys, you know, piping back up towards our box and mountain the box and all that stuff.
**Esetka**: So, yeah, obviously you guys have done this before, too, but it's going to take, you know, do part A, then we can do part B.
**Esetka**: So.
**Esetka**: But yeah, on the labeling, I just figured leave it intact till we get it all worked back to the new location, trim it up once we have, you know, verification exactly where the panel is going to sit, and then one at a time, just re identify stuff.
**Brhoades**: Yeah, yeah, back into the panel, cut it to length, the label on.
**Brhoades**: Yeah, yeah.
**Esetka**: So how long do you guys need to terminate?
**Esetka**: I mean, you guys are terminating, is that right?
**Esetka**: You guys are re terminating everything or.
**Esetka**: We're re terminating everything, I think y' all were reterminating.
**Brhoades**: Yeah, yeah.
**Esetka**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, we won't have any electricians there, so you guys re terminate everything and make it look pretty.
**Esetka**: So.
**Esetka**: Yeah, so we need to be done the wire back.
**Esetka**: So, A.J.
**Esetka**: i mean, we're going to be there late Saturday, I imagine.
**Esetka**: You know, we're going to work a late, late day.
**Esetka**: So I guess everybody's aware of that.
**Dworsham**: Yeah, well, we have Sunday, I think.
**Brhoades**: Yeah, but we don't want to have.
**Dworsham**: To have guys work Sunday if we don't have to.
**Esetka**: Well, no, we're gonna have To.
**Esetka**: I mean, I think Sunday we need to have everything ready to start terminating and then you still have startup and testing, right?
**Esetka**: I mean, all that has to happen.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Esetka**: So you guys probably need four to six hours just to start up and test everything.
**Ataylor**: Probably.
**Ataylor**: And make sure everything's landed in the right spot, nothing's loose and all that.
**Ataylor**: Because you almost have to like redo auto checkout and make sure everything's still plugged in the right spot and all that good stuff.
**Esetka**: Yeah.
**Esetka**: So we need to be done by noon Sunday, I think, you know, with everything on our end, you guys have time to.
**Esetka**: So yeah, it's.
**Esetka**: It's a, it's a big, big amount of work in a short amount of time.
**Esetka**: So.
**Ataylor**: Yes, it is.
**Ataylor**: And they tried to take Sunday and say it needed to be running by end of day on Saturday.
**Ataylor**: And we're like, no, sorry, we're not gonna sign up for that.
**Brhoades**: Yeah.
**Brhoades**: So then what's committed to is they, they're going to be picking packages on the side and go ahead and packing them.
**Brhoades**: And then once everything's back up and running and we start doing our testing, they're going to have a bunch of lot like I think they're sitting, going to 10,000 packaging or something crazy.
**Brhoades**: And they're going to start just throwing them on the line and that's how we'll start them in testing.
**Brhoades**: You know, once we.
**Brhoades**: Once we bump motors and all that good stuff.
**Brhoades**: So they're doing some checkout then.
**Brhoades**: Yeah, they'll activate radio actually runs in.
**Kriebe**: Production on Sunday end of the day.
**Esetka**: Okay.
**Esetka**: So yeah, we're gonna, we're gonna, you know, I'll tell our guys and we'll have five guys on site.
**Esetka**: So I think we'll be a little overstaffed, just, you know, better safe than sorry kind of situation.
**Esetka**: But yeah, I mean, we're gonna be, we're gonna need every minute we have, for sure.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, I think, I think so as well.
**Brhoades**: And our guys there, he'll be working, waiting for all that happens.
**Brhoades**: But by all means, if I mentioned to him, like anything, he can jump in and help speed it along.
**Kriebe**: You know, he jumps in.
**Brhoades**: He does that.
**Esetka**: So much appreciated.
**Esetka**: So who do we update throughout the weekend or is everybody going to kind of be good with what we're doing and we just all assume that it all works?
**Esetka**: Monday, when we show up, we'll have Eric there from.
**Ataylor**: So Eric will be.
**Dworsham**: Guys keep me, keep me in the loop and I can update jp.
**Dworsham**: Okay.
**Brhoades**: Robert.
**Esetka**: Yeah.
**Esetka**: So I really feel like our milestones.
**Esetka**: I Just, you know, I feel like we need to have all the wire back in the cabinet Saturday before we leave.
**Esetka**: That would give us five or six hours Sunday morning to get everything re terminated and give these guys time to do validation.
**Ataylor**: That'll work for us.
**Esetka**: So.
**Esetka**: Yeah.
**Esetka**: So, aj, Just so you know, like, that's.
**Esetka**: That's gonna be our good, no good, you know, kind of situation is, you know, but I feel like if we don't have everything back in that cabinet bolted back down and the wire all back in there ready to terminate, then we're kind of behind where we need to be, so.
**Dworsham**: Yep.
**Ataylor**: And if that's the case, I mean, I'll ask Eric to keep me updated over the weekend as well, so we can just over communicate with customer.
**Esetka**: All right.
**Dworsham**: The biggest thing is, is by Saturday night, letting them know if it's going to happen or not.
**Esetka**: I guess.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, I mean, we'll.
**Ataylor**: We'll keep them updated.
**Brhoades**: I.
**Ataylor**: If all goes according to plan, then you won't have any issues.
**Ataylor**: But I mean, you guys will have five guys, we'll have four.
**Ataylor**: So we're gonna have plenty of people, plenty of hands.
**Ataylor**: So I think we'll be able to get them.
**Esetka**: Yeah, I guess for us, the big thing, just so I'll make sure we communicate this guy.
**Esetka**: I just need to make sure we're able to slide all that pipe off them wires.
**Esetka**: So we're gonna have to work it all the way back, you know, or maybe we can slide it back and pull.
**Esetka**: Pull it out halfway and then slide the other half or something like that, but I just can't.
**Esetka**: I don't think I can get in a situation where we cut all the wires and then.
**Esetka**: And then slide.
**Esetka**: You know, the pipe just comes off freely.
**Brhoades**: Yeah.
**Esetka**: I think we're gonna slide this piece of pipe off the wire and leave all the labels intact.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: Well, Carrie is on this call, so just work together on that when.
**Ataylor**: When you guys are getting started.
**Ataylor**: And Carrie, just don't keep in mind and tell the rest of the crew, don't cut any of the wires in that conduit going to the right side there.
**Ataylor**: Just leave it intact and let the electricians handle that part.
**Brhoades**: Yeah.
**Brhoades**: The hope would be that once you pull a couple conduit, like a couple wires out the conduit, then you should be able to pull a lot more.
**Brhoades**: Yeah.
**Brhoades**: Because of the wire labels, they won't go through.
**Kriebe**: Then.
**Brhoades**: I've had before where I just had to cut the label off, like cut the end off of one wire, pull that one out and relabel it immediately, and then it plays up enough space.
**Kriebe**: To just pull up and coil up the.
**Brhoades**: Everything from that conduit.
**Esetka**: Yep, 100%.
**Esetka**: Yeah.
**Esetka**: Because they're all going to be boogered up and curled and twisted, so.
**Brhoades**: Yep, that's all the spot.
**Esetka**: All right, well, it sounds like we got the right people.
**Esetka**: Our guys are familiar with this work.
**Esetka**: Our guys that are going to be there are going to be.
**Esetka**: You know, this isn't their first time doing something like this, so they'll be well equipped to do the job, so.
**Esetka**: Yep, I'll make sure.
**Esetka**: I just.
**Esetka**: Yeah, we'll communicate with Williams.
**Esetka**: We'll be there to help as well.
**Esetka**: We have, like I said, a couple extra people that probably have some downtime, so anything we can do to help with stuff that, you know, I don't want.
**Esetka**: Like, maybe not our task, but we'll do whatever to get this done, so we'll be there, ready to go.
**Esetka**: And I guess, do we.
**Esetka**: Are we throwing all this pipe away, aj, Are we throwing in a dumpster that's coming down?
**Esetka**: Do we have a plan for that?
**Dworsham**: I mean, if you want to reuse it and save yourself some money on other places, I'm.
**Dworsham**: I'm cool with that.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Esetka**: Okay.
**Esetka**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: Giving it to you guys because most of it's straight pipe that you can use somewhere else.
**Esetka**: Okay.
**Esetka**: At the end of the day, we'll move it over to our area.
**Esetka**: I just don't.
**Esetka**: I'll make sure it's all cleaned up before we leave Sunday, so.
**Brhoades**: Yeah.
**Brhoades**: Plus all the LBs and all the other, you know, connectors that split.
**Brhoades**: Bit of money worth of stuff when.
**Kriebe**: It'S all said and done.
**Brhoades**: So those things.
**Brhoades**: Throw it in a dumpster.
**Esetka**: Cool.
**Esetka**: All right.
**Esetka**: I think we're good on our end.
**Esetka**: Brennan, are you good?
**Dworsham**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: Sounds like you guys got a pretty.
**Esetka**: Good plan all figured out, so.
**Ataylor**: All right, cool.
**Ataylor**: Sounds good.
**Ataylor**: Well, if you need anything, just let me know.
**Esetka**: All right, thanks, guys.
**Ataylor**: All right, thank you.
