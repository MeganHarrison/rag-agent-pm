## Transcript
**Njepson**: Foreign.
**Njepson**: What's up, Andrew?
**Njepson**: Hey, Jesse, got Griffin on here.
**Jdawson**: Nice.
**Njepson**: Griffin, can you hear us?
**Gkelly**: Yes, sir, I can hear you.
**Njepson**: I don't know.
**Njepson**: Do we have anyone else joining?
**Jdawson**: Andrew, I.
**Jdawson**: Griffin did I see Greg was coming down to the site, so he might either call in or he, he.
**Gkelly**: He should be jumping on here in a minute.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Gkelly**: He wanted to be on this, so.
**Jdawson**: Perfect.
**Jdawson**: And then Jeff with the HVC guy, he's on his way here on the road, so he's unable to join the electricians.
**Jdawson**: I gave them an invite.
**Jdawson**: They're gonna get on Adam the painter.
**Jdawson**: I sent him an invite.
**Jdawson**: Let me see if he got it.
**Jdawson**: Adam, the painter will be on in a second.
**Jdawson**: He's walking out of store.
**Adam**: Hey, can you guys hear me?
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Njepson**: Yeah, we can hear you, Nick.
**Brhoades**: Yeah, I can hear you.
**Njepson**: So I don't know if you can see.
**Njepson**: I shared my screen, which I just put the schedule up here.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: So we could look at it in real time.
**Njepson**: And we get.
**Njepson**: So right here we had hanging drywall, finishing on the 18th, finishing drywall starting on the 18th.
**Njepson**: Door frame install installation.
**Njepson**: I didn't see any door frames installed.
**Jdawson**: Door frames are in.
**Njepson**: Are they all in?
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Njepson**: And prime and first coat was supposed to start Tuesday.
**Njepson**: That's in.
**Njepson**: So this here is what we need to figure out how this is going to work.
**Njepson**: You said the S M was on Andrew?
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: Adam just joined.
**Ahuettl**: Yep, I'm here.
**Njepson**: So I guess, Griffin, tell us where you guys are at and like, which areas are done as of today.
**Njepson**: You know which ones are left and you know what direction.
**Gkelly**: So right now we are working on getting the.
**Gkelly**: What used to be the pool area and working our way around into the classrooms getting that finished up.
**Gkelly**: We should have a good amount of that pool area sanded tomorrow and ready for paint on Monday.
**Gkelly**: So, yeah, the daycare, the bathroom, the whole back area that splits the two spaces up is all ready for paint.
**Ahuettl**: Okay.
**Njepson**: All right.
**Njepson**: And Then today's the 7th.
**Njepson**: Like, when are they done?
**Gkelly**: Right now we're looking at probably finishing up the majority of it, middle of next week.
**Gkelly**: And then, you know, we'll have some loose ends, kind of some touch up things on the existing walls.
**Gkelly**: That will take us probably till Friday.
**Njepson**: But the painter will be released in all areas.
**Njepson**: What day?
**Gkelly**: I would say probably Wednesday.
**Gkelly**: We should have a good amount of it ready for him.
**Brhoades**: If I had to guess from being down there the other day, the existing bulkhead that is so gnarly.
**Brhoades**: And then the wall that is towards, like the vestibule that existing Wall was really, really bad up high.
**Brhoades**: So that's the area that there's no ceiling.
**Brhoades**: If I had to guess, that's probably what's going to lag behind because that was in just horrendous shape.
**Gkelly**: Yes.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Ahuettl**: And that's the area, guys, that still has a bunch of electrical and pipes and stuff to be moved so that we can paint all the way up to the ceiling and paint the deck as well, is what I'm understanding that's going to be.
**Ahuettl**: That's on my schedule to do very last as far as painting goes.
**Brhoades**: Yeah.
**Brhoades**: Which I think we still have some of that going on because there were some pipes in a room that somebody had down.
**Brhoades**: Well, I know there was two rooms.
**Brhoades**: The room that you guys approved the walls to go to the deck, that room, there was some low pipes and then the room next to it that have to move up.
**Brhoades**: So I mean, there's going to be things like that that lag behind.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Njepson**: Now the.
**Njepson**: You know, for whatever reason, there was low voltage wires left in the wall.
**Njepson**: And it's just at this point, unless you say differently, I told Andrew to just.
**Njepson**: Maybe Andrew already did it.
**Njepson**: But the only thing.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I already moved them up.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: Because like we don't know where they go or what they feed because they just loop around from the existing back into the existing.
**Njepson**: So we're going to have to have some patching done of those walls, but at least they're up, out of the way.
**Njepson**: The guy can put his grid in.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: If that's better to just do it that way we've got that wall on the end.
**Njepson**: That's just lack coordination on our part to make sure all these, you know that those drawing changes came on out, but they weren't clouded.
**Njepson**: I get it.
**Njepson**: But seeing that a ceiling is going to die into an empty space, we should have caught that.
**Njepson**: But how long will that take to get that framed up there?
**Brhoades**: You got a couple days in framing it and hanging it.
**Brhoades**: You probably got three days if we can turn right around.
**Brhoades**: I just got to get him some help down there for that.
**Njepson**: Okay, so this puts you out to the 3:10 Wednesdays.
**Njepson**: What day is Wednesday?
**Njepson**: The 12th.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Brhoades**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: Okay, this epoxy, is that going to have to move?
**Njepson**: Epoxy in the daycare bathrooms, like.
**Ahuettl**: Floors or walls?
**Ahuettl**: Sorry?
**Njepson**: Epoxy on the floors.
**Ahuettl**: That one's not me.
**Njepson**: Oh, you're not doing that.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Njepson**: But the painting of the walls is done.
**Njepson**: I see the ceiling grid on the walls.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: And the.
**Njepson**: The ceiling grid is.
**Njepson**: Is that in.
**Njepson**: In the bathrooms.
**Njepson**: So he should be able to still do his thing.
**Gkelly**: Yeah, the grid is in.
**Gkelly**: In the bathrooms right now.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: I know Jeff with CNS needs to get in there too, so he'll be on site in a bit.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Njepson**: Alex, when was our turnover day where we had to.
**Njepson**: Because we committed to them to get in.
**Njepson**: I should have checked that for you.
**Njepson**: Let's see here.
**Ahuettl**: 418.
**Njepson**: Yeah, because right now this is pushing us out and they got.
**Njepson**: I mean they are all set to go with classes says 422.
**Njepson**: But so for painting, S M is going to be out there.
**Njepson**: The casework we got that following.
**Njepson**: That's just a set date.
**Njepson**: Looks like that's not tied to anything.
**Griffinkelly**: Correct.
**Njepson**: That's just that date ceiling grid that's going to come in.
**Njepson**: When do they plan on being done with ceiling grid then the painter, if he gets finished by the 13th.
**Ahuettl**: We'Ll.
**Brhoades**: Just keep following them.
**Brhoades**: I mean for each area that he does, we'll just follow him right behind it.
**Brhoades**: So you can figure there's about 600 square feet, 6 to 800 square feet a day is what a crew can do.
**Njepson**: Okay, well, maybe that was too much.
**Njepson**: Here we got diamond glass, 324.
**Njepson**: Is that confirmed?
**Jdawson**: Give them a call.
**Jdawson**: I've been meaning to call them today.
**Griffinkelly**: Yes, that's confirmed.
**Njepson**: Then you had out to 319 for ceiling borders.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Njepson**: I don't know why this.
**Njepson**: I don't know how this thing was tied together, but I mean this pulls back our date in.
**Njepson**: If you're done with the ceiling starting ceiling borders by the 19th.
**Njepson**: I don't know.
**Njepson**: Is there anything stopping them guys from doing that anyways?
**Brhoades**: Doing borders?
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: Or is that the same crew?
**Brhoades**: No, I mean we can put a couple extra guys in there to do borders behind them.
**Brhoades**: So.
**Njepson**: We got deem on here.
**Njepson**: We got lighting going in on the 19th.
**Jdawson**: They've gotten some lights put in already.
**Njepson**: Some devices, they're following them through.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Griffinkelly**: Yeah, they're following the grid.
**Njepson**: Okay, so I just want to see on here.
**Njepson**: Is there anything.
**Njepson**: It's going to get held up.
**Njepson**: If the painter follows Glenmark, it's done by the 13th.
**Njepson**: Well, no, that's the 13th is the day after.
**Njepson**: And how many more days?
**Njepson**: You know, if you're following them around painting, once they're done with their drywall, do you need a couple more days to get it painted?
**Ahuettl**: They.
**Ahuettl**: I got two guys down there now, they're priming and they drop back.
**Ahuettl**: They try to prime ahead and drop back and start Finish coating.
**Ahuettl**: So like with all of those like we started in the, in the bathrooms the daycare is done.
**Ahuettl**: The electrical room to the west of the bathrooms are done.
**Ahuettl**: The two office and the classroom or whatever that might be to the far left of that is all first coded.
**Ahuettl**: And he was running down in priming hallways yesterday.
**Ahuettl**: Got next thing we got to do is we got to drop back and spray all those door casings.
**Ahuettl**: So that's kind of my, my big thing.
**Ahuettl**: And then once we get the door casing sprayed then we're going to jump into the daycare as much as we can and try and for about need about two days to do to finish all the doctor as fast as the drywall is getting sanded I got my guys are right behind them priming them and then when they catch up to the, to the sanders they're dropping back and first coat and walls.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Njepson**: And these door.
**Njepson**: You're just putting pot like painters plastic to protect the walls when you're spraying in there.
**Ahuettl**: When on the, on the.
**Ahuettl**: In the daycare.
**Njepson**: Yeah, in the daycare area the walls.
**Ahuettl**: Are just first coated only so nothing's finished yet.
**Ahuettl**: And we will stand those up in the middle of the room and spray the doors.
**Ahuettl**: They won't be against the walls or anything like that.
**Ahuettl**: But yeah, if there's anything close enough, if anything is close enough, we can, we can protect the walls but we still have to go back through.
**Ahuettl**: They have to do dry or the drywallers got to do a touch up and then we still have to do prime and or prime the touch up spots and then do a final coat.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Njepson**: All right.
**Njepson**: Well, I mean honestly there's room could be picked up with a lot of these things.
**Njepson**: Ceiling grid going in quicker than anticipated.
**Njepson**: So.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Njepson**: Yeah, just that whole.
**Njepson**: These dates here have moved out a lot but it looks like all these other things can move up.
**Brhoades**: So when are your transom window frames coming in, Jesse?
**Brhoades**: And are those welded frame?
**Brhoades**: Are those a knockdown frame?
**Griffinkelly**: They are knockdowns and they're set to arrive at Central Indiana hardware on Wednesday this coming week.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Njepson**: Was there an activity in here for putting them in?
**Njepson**: There is not.
**Njepson**: They're coming in on what date?
**Griffinkelly**: The 12th.
**Griffinkelly**: Wednesday.
**Griffinkelly**: The 12th.
**Brhoades**: Okay, so are you guys picking those up or are you waiting for central to ship them?
**Ahuettl**: They'll bring them.
**Griffinkelly**: They'll bring him down along with the door frame for classroom or office.
**Griffinkelly**: 119.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Brhoades**: So is that coming down on the 17th I assume then the 12th.
**Brhoades**: Oh, it is coming to the job on the 12th.
**Griffinkelly**: Yeah, they're gonna get it and drive it right down.
**Brhoades**: Okay.
**Brhoades**: All right.
**Brhoades**: Because we'll need to get those transom windows in the frames in because that's.
**Brhoades**: They'll ding up the walls and stuff going around it and then we'll have to touch that up.
**Brhoades**: So getting them in there, that just guarantee to scrape the wall up.
**Griffinkelly**: Yep.
**Njepson**: What is that two day activity?
**Brhoades**: Probably just depending on how.
**Brhoades**: How easy they go in.
**Brhoades**: I mean some.
**Brhoades**: Sometimes they go in real easy, sometimes you can fight them.
**Brhoades**: It just depends on what you guys bought and what they buy.
**Njepson**: Okay, now we got that glass.
**Njepson**: When's that coming here for those transom windows?
**Njepson**: You know that Nick, once it's installed.
**Adam**: He'S going to come and measure and then he makes them pretty quick.
**Njepson**: Yeah, we tried to that other windows like an inch bigger than the one that got broke that's coming out or did they look at that?
**Njepson**: Just speaking of windows for the one that got broke.
**Adam**: Yeah, diamond glass looked at that and I think they're pricing it.
**Njepson**: They can't reuse existing.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Existing is too big and it's too thick.
**Njepson**: All right.
**Njepson**: All right then.
**Njepson**: So.
**Njepson**: So we're on the same page here.
**Njepson**: We got finish and drywall finishing by Wednesday.
**Njepson**: Other than you think maybe a couple of those areas that have it existing drywall, that's bad.
**Njepson**: The door frames done priming and painting by the 17th is what we're trying for.
**Njepson**: Finish that casework still on ceiling grid.
**Njepson**: Finish up.
**Njepson**: Should almost finish same date as the painting.
**Njepson**: There's everything's tied to this.
**Brhoades**: Yeah, we'll just, we'll keep following them as.
**Brhoades**: As they go.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Njepson**: All right, well I'll get this in a PDF and send it out to everybody.
**Njepson**: And I appreciate you getting on this call getting all this cleared up.
**Njepson**: Does anyone have any questions or see something else that needs to be added?
**Jdawson**: I think for direction of where we're going to move is starting in that entry vestibule.
**Jdawson**: We'll paint throughout there through the hallways, around into the main areas.
**Jdawson**: Ceiling grid will fall that way and then move on into the classrooms.
**Griffinkelly**: Correct.
**Jdawson**: So determine classrooms you want to start and go from there.
**Jdawson**: Other than that, I don't have anything.
**Ahuettl**: Are all those lighting fixtures out of the vestibule or is that.
**Ahuettl**: Are we still.
**Jdawson**: They're still.
**Jdawson**: They're still in there as of now.
**Ahuettl**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: That can be a ending spot with the.
**Jdawson**: The area, the dry fall paint and everything's going.
**Ahuettl**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Of course, as more lights go in like that, that area will open up.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: On the demo that's one thing that, you know, there's some.
**Njepson**: Still some stuff hanging down in the exposed ceiling areas.
**Njepson**: Greg, was that part of your.
**Njepson**: I didn't look, but should your guys have taken all that stuff down during the demo?
**Brhoades**: If it's wall stuff, yes.
**Njepson**: Like ceiling wires, tie wires and things like that?
**Brhoades**: Yeah, we can go through and clip those out.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Griffinkelly**: Anything left I'll get taken care of on Friday next week.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Njepson**: And when were you planning on doing that paint, Adam?
**Ahuettl**: The dry fall?
**Njepson**: Yes.
**Ahuettl**: I just need a.
**Ahuettl**: All I need is one day and I just need a heads up.
**Ahuettl**: A couple days heads up and I'll have the materials there.
**Ahuettl**: I just need to know when all that stuff gets once it's done and ready to go, so.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Ahuettl**: Like I said, we'll be down there.
**Ahuettl**: I mean, we're going to be down there probably for all of next week and then we'll still be, you know, got the doors to do and then I.
**Ahuettl**: I don't know if I missed it, but are we still like, scheduled to start the final code on the 26th?
**Ahuettl**: Is that still on the schedule?
**Njepson**: Yeah, it's.
**Njepson**: Well, it's showing the 25th right now, but.
**Ahuettl**: Okay.
**Njepson**: So.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah, that's not a big either way.
**Ahuettl**: Any, you know, whatever it is through there is fine.
**Ahuettl**: Just make sure I didn't miss any move.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Njepson**: You just need to paint that first, though, before you do your final.
**Njepson**: Paint the ceiling.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah, yeah, we need to ceiling first before we do the final in just that area.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Griffinkelly**: Yeah, Siemens will be back down to get the sprinkler in that area taken care of as well before dry fall.
**Njepson**: Yeah, they just.
**Njepson**: I need to push this out a little because they have you finish and final paint after the case works in.
**Njepson**: Get a day to touch that up.
**Njepson**: All right, well, if there's nothing else, thanks everybody for joining.
**Njepson**: Appreciate it.
**Jdawson**: Thanks, guys.
**Ahuettl**: Thank you.
