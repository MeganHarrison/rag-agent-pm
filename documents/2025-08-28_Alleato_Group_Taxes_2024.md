## Transcript

**Fatima Njie:**
Jesse, can you hear us? 

**Justin Atneyel:**
I can. How you doing, Maria? 

**Justin Atneyel:**
Oh, good. 

**Fatima Njie:**
And you? 

**Justin Atneyel:**
I am doing well. Hey, Brandon. Hey. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
What's up? 

**Justin Atneyel:**
How you doing? 

**Justin Atneyel:**
How are you? Good. Good. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
So I got some updates for you guys. I've been doing some interviewing, and. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
We. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
Got a quote back from. We got a quote back from Baker Tilly. We got a quote back from Cohen. Resinick and I just met from the tax partner yesterday from mgo, and he said he's going to have a proposal out to us this week as well. However, I am concerned about getting our tax returns done for 2024. And I just want to meet with you, Brandon and Maria to see, like, what CBIZ has done and has not done. Like, do we know if they've filed an extension for 24? I assume they have. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
Yep. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah, I know. So Caleb texted me, I don't know, I think this week, maybe asking me about the docs. So he. He sent me. I gotta look and see what his list is. But I said, yeah, I said, let's go. What do you need? I said, send me a list of what you need. So, yeah, we just send those documents and he can, you know, they can do 20, 24. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
Okay. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
Brandon, do you know what CBIS charges you for your business returns? 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Not off the top of my head. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
Okay. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
I'd have to go look at the last year's receipts. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
Okay. Hey, Fatima, can you do that? 

**Justin Atneyel:**
Yeah. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
So, Brandon, I really like the MGO tax partner. He just seems like a more progressive guy that understands real estate and construction really deeply. And I explained to them, you know, your K1 situations and minority interest and the other entities, your personal picture, as best as I know it. And then the business side, I really enjoyed talking to him. The Cohen guy is really good too. I'm not as huge a fan. And Baker Tilly, I don't want to talk to them anymore since they became Baker Tilly because their fees are egregious and it just doesn't add up to me. So I am pushing for mgo. I just want to see a proposal for what they want. Every single firm is very, very. Is very, very. They're pushing on doing the personal with the Alito return because it involves your minority K1s and kind of the whole picture if they want to be able to do tax planning and strategy. Are you okay with that, Brandon? 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah, that's fine. And we haven't even got a damn. You know, I saw Maria email the other day. Like, it's like pulling teeth for some of these people to get us Proposals. It's ridiculous. So, yeah, we'll just put it all together and go from there. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
Yeah, I mean, you understand, man, how, how like, yeah, these firms are. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
I mean, it blows my mind. It's like, you know, every time I talk to somebody and they're like, oh, it's, you know, $100,000, you know, is that in your ballpark? I'm like, yeah. But then push ups his job and I can't get a damn proposal. Like, what's going on? 

**Justin Atneyel:**
Yeah, well, the, the different firms are just getting acquired and then their sales teams have become like. It's just the back and forth between the actual tax partners and the sales teams is so disconnected. But I'm going to wait for this MGO and then I will make a suggestion, Brandon. Then you tell me if you want to interview all of them. We can interview all of them. 24 will be behind us if CBIS files, which will make me a lot more comfortable. And we're going to have a long term partner here that is going to help us. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah, that'd be good. And I don't, I think 24 is the last year for top choice properties. Can we dissolve that? So that's good. So we don't have to worry about that in 25. And then. Yeah. The only other thing is there's no Boundaries Consulting, which is just a holding company. So it's a very simple thing. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
And what is your ownership and no boundaries percentage? 

**Brandon Clymer:**
100%. It's all mine. It's literally just a holding company. So like for instance, like, like, so for instance, I just, I just sold this company called Spartan Radar out in California. I literally just got an email five minutes ago about the payouts. So like no Boundaries Consulting holds the ownership in that company, you know, and then I, I can't remember what other ones I'd have to go look. But like some, like, like there's like some like, basically a lot of my real estate stuff. Like, so the apartments and like there's like an Airbnb portfolio thing that I own part of, you know, all that. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
Stuff and it's all owned by no Boundaries. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
Okay. Yep. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah. So like for instance, you know, like I got one apartment building in Indianapolis area and that one's on the market now. Right. But the, the owner is not Brandon Clymer. It's no Boundaries. Like the only thing that, that I own underneath my thing is like Alito, I think Arc Edge, the solar company, I filled that out as me owning directly. Basically anything that's an operating business that I'm doing something in actively working in like Arc Edge Alito, then I have it to me. Anything that's a passive, it typically is going to go to a holding company. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
Okay. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
And do you own 100% of Arc Edge? 

**Brandon Clymer:**
No, no, I just own 10% of that one. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
Okay. Okay. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
So you will be getting a K1 from Arc Edge and somebody else is handling the accounting and they report a K1 to us, correct? 

**Justin Atneyel:**
Yep. Okay. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
And so. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
Okay, perfect. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
So they would be doing the no Limits LLC return as well, right? 

**Brandon Clymer:**
No batteries? No. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
Yeah. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yes. Yeah, they fucking better because I got on their ass. We said Violet two years ago. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
Okay, okay. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
Perfect. We have. Okay, I have the interview with MGO or the proposal interview with mgo. I'll review that. I want to make sure I have all the proper data points they were giving. They were given a 23 return which should have no boundaries in that return. Right, Brandon? 

**Brandon Clymer:**
That's the. That's the one that CBIZ messed up and didn't file. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
Damn it. Okay. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
I've been. I've been getting proposed off the 23. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
I mean, that's fine. I mean, we're. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
It's a. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Again, it's. It's minuscule. Right? Like the. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
The. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
You know, that's. If that's a 30% shift in their number, then it's. That's ridiculous. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
Okay. I just didn't want to piss you off. Ye know, I want to make sure. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Again, it's a very simple return. There's no active, you know, movement. Really. So again, that should be. I mean, hell, if I needed to, I could fill that out through, you know, whatever. The online tax thing, you know, TurboTax. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
Okay. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
All right, cool. As long as you're good with that, I'll. I'll get empty. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah, the biggest thing is, you know, the biggest thing is. Is my personal in Alito. Right? Those are the. Those. That's the lion's share of everything. You know, these other little piddly things are minor. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
Yeah, yeah. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
I mean, no Boundaries has a flow through. There's flow through income coming in there. Right. Brandon, are you. Are you taking distributions from the company? 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah. So no Boundaries will. I mean, as I get stuff, you know, it takes it, but like, there's just not a lot of movement. Right. So like. Like 23, you know, I don't know how much movement there was. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
It. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
You know, I got again, quarterly distributions, a few of them, but, you know, nothing major. Right. And then 24, you know, I think I got. I might have a little bit more Because I think I either 24 or 25. I can't remember when I, we had a first tranche sell for Spartan. But yeah, again it's, it's. You're talking, you know, six transactions or whatever a year at best. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
Okay, yeah, perfect. All right, man. Well, I'll get that all started with MGO and then I'll give you my input. And then if you would like to hold an interview with any of them, you let me know. Otherwise I'll, I'll give you my thoughts. Anything else, Brandon, on your side, brother, that you want to go over or anything like that? 

**Brandon Clymer:**
You know, that's the biggest thing I'm looking at insurance options. I've got. I met with this, I can't remember the name of this company. Basically it's like a self insured thing. I don't know how to explain it. So one of my friends that I met through Tony, you know, they, they, they, they had a construction company. They did it. So anyway, I'm just trying to look at that because the way that they are, you know, evaluating us is ridiculous in, in the insurance market. Like, you know, they're, they're saying that if, if somebody walks on site, they're a fucking carpenter. Like, it's like, no, like that's not. Like we don't, we don't work. Like, we're not picking up hammers and stuff. And so yeah, that, that's annoying. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
So one of my first roles was I was a fractional CFO for a company called Woodich that was bought by Hub. And I know a gentleman, I know the owner, Bill Woodich, and I know Rob Welborn who's a construction insurance broker. Like a brother to me. Like I know his kids. I'm happy. Like he will, he is the best insurance person I know for construction. If you would like to have a convo with them, I can absolutely make an introduction. He cares. Like he'll probably fly out there and see you. He's very, very relationship driven. If you would like, I'm happy to intro you. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah, yeah. If you want to sit, you know, see if he's interested, you know, and just Fatima and the team, they have all of our insurance documents, you know, so you send it all to him and he can take a look at it. But yeah, I'm definitely looking at some different options, which I like. The, you know, the thought of the, A lot of big companies do the self insured thing. It gives a little bit more flexibility, you know, especially with being able to use the, the premiums as an investment tool like normal insurance companies do. So once I get that information as well, I'll share that with you because I again, I don't know ton about it. I asked for more info, what it looks like, cost, things like that. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
Of course, send it over. I'll take a look at it, man. And then I'll get an email out to Rob Welborn initially. I'll do it with Rob, Maria, and Fatima because he's going to ask for a bunch of docs and stuff. I'll let them look at that and then I'll make an intro to you if he feels like he can provide value. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Okay, perfect. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
Cool. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
Anything else, Brandon? 

**Fatima Njie:**
Yeah, sounds good. Whatever you need. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
Okay. 

**Fatima Njie:**
Are we expecting any more insurance invoices, Brandon, or is that it? 

**Brandon Clymer:**
I don't know. I hope we don't have. 

**Fatima Njie:**
I feel like I see a new one every. Every week. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah, I know. Yeah, I hope. I mean, you know, I hope not, but, you know, before long it's going to be a new year and so I'm assuming we'll have a brand new round of them. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
Okay. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
Maria, I'm going to send an email with Rob cc'd in that and I'm going to ask that you attach all relevant policies for Alito Workers Comp General. I don't know what else you have, epli, whatever that is, and I'll holistically look at all of them with Rob for you. Brandon. He's an absolute animal. So he'll look through all these things and situate us. I'm sure he will. So, Maria, I'll send that email out right after this call. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
Okay? 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Did you. Justin, have you got a chance to. 

**Fatima Njie:**
Thank you. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Have you gotten a chance to look at the latest whip July? 

**Justin Atneyel:**
Yeah, yeah, I did. Fatima sent it to me. She sent the prelim out to me on Monday and I reviewed it. Yeah, I didn't like what June was coming out to be and I had a lot of questions. I think that prompted Fatima to sit with Jesse again and rerun through everything and it seemed like there was some pro course situation. I am feeling a lot more comfortable with the WIP now for July. Why do you ask other than did I review it? Do you have any. Anything there that we're gonna sit down and meet and review? I'm hoping pretty soon here. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
I mean, I. I don't have an agenda of. Why it's more along the lines of I don't. You know, I've seen two whips now. You know, July and. Or whatever. June, like I, you know, I look at it and I'm like, okay, how much money are we supposedly making? Right. Like, so I'm more along the lines of what is your thoughts? You know, do we, did we, do we have a. Like I'm in accounting. Fatima, do we have it saved somewhere? Where are we saving these at? 

**Fatima Njie:**
No, I haven't saved it yet. I'll create an accountant folder and put it in there once Justin reviews July and we finalized. And I'll drop both of them in there. I'll drop June in there for you. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
I'll make time with Fatima today, Brandon, to do a more thorough run through of the WIP and give my input as well. And I'll attach that. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
Okay. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah, yeah. If we can again, more along the lines of, you know, I want to better understand it and speak the language. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
Of course, of course. 

**Fatima Njie:**
I've been having regular with meetings with Jesse to review them. Do you want to be included in those? 

**Brandon Clymer:**
I mean, I, I mean, I, I don't know. I'll. I'll look at some of the recordings. I'm assuming you're just going through and saying, well, where's this project at in this? Correct. Like you're doing more accuracy, right? 

**Fatima Njie:**
Yeah, yeah. And. And his, he's kind of asking questions also. How, how do we determine, you know, the over. Under. Basically what all the numbers mean? 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah, let's. Why don't you and Justin, like I said, get you there and look at it and then, you know, I'll review it, you know, whenever we have our, whenever I, we have our next get together, Justin. And then if I feel that I, you know, I need to be in those meetings or something, then I will. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
Okay, sounds good. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
Yeah, we, we like the meetings with Jesse, right, Fatima? Because that's. Yeah, I poke holes in the whip because I don't like how things look and Fatima does better than I do, honestly. And then I don't accept it until Jesse comes in and actually reviews every single line item. So. Yeah, I don't want to publish a number without having confidence that they're true and correct. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
So I think that's good. Just, you know, Jesse's working really hard to get me out of operations and focus more just on, you know, sales, marketing, you know, more back of house stuff. And he's really trying to take over all the, all the op stuff. So. Yeah, I mean I, I could look in that but you know, out of an abundance of caution, if I get in that meeting, then I'm going to take over and he's Going to be a bystander. And, you know, I'm gonna. I'm gonna be like, what's going on here? What's going. And next thing I know, it's. I'm in the weeds. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
Yeah. 

**Fatima Njie:**
I would say the job planner jobs are fine. It was just altered Atlas and Procore. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
Yeah. 

**Fatima Njie:**
Not pulling in correct numbers from into Ikea Medica from, like, you know, 2023. But I think once. I think Ulta is good now. I kind of made AJ do some work last week. I think we're good as far as job planning goes. But I did mention. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah, he was. He was bitching, and I'm like, you understand? I don't give a. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
Do it. 

**Fatima Njie:**
Yeah, I. I hit it. I. I could tell that he didn't like it, but, you know, he. He's like, he had to do it. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
But now the team is making. The team is making me do all this stuff like, oh, oh, your job. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
Oh, okay. Yeah. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah. 

**Fatima Njie:**
But I did recommend to just say that now that we are on track, I think for August, we are on track. Everything is good to go to where we can have whips in, like, a timely manner. I think he probably needs to review it with. With, like, the PMs, just to kind of show them, okay, this is where we are. Are you missing anything? Because. And. And I think that's one thing they struggle with understanding, too. Just not just having the commitment out there, you know, I need more than that. If the job has been done, we need to build, you know, the sub invoice. Just having the commitment does not give me anything on the web. It's still going to show that you don't have enough cost. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
So part of that is. Part of that is those PSRs, you know, which, again, him and I were actually talking about that last night. Like, so, like, you know, the PSRs have already started coming in this month, and they're dialed in more accurate, like. And so our thought is within the next month or two, you know, probably we'll just say two months. These guys have enough practice and honed in to where it's. It's correct. You know, they know how to. To do it. And then that PSR directly feeds into the WIP so that, you know, I see the whole picture. 

**Fatima Njie:**
Yeah. Yeah. I think we're definitely heading in the right direction with the project team. As far as accounting goes. I've been kind of, you know, just taking a backseat a little bit. I see when you ask them questions, I, you know, let them answer until I have to jump in, but I think they've been doing a, you know, really good job at like, you know, trying to chase stuff and really understand what's, what's happening. Yeah, I'm, I'm here, I'm seeing it. I'm not ignoring. I'm just kind of, you know, letting them take, take the first step to answering the questions. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
You know, from six months ago, it's, it's night and day again. Like the, the automation, you know, of all the costs and credit cards is huge. Right. And so, you know, it's, it's like, you know, we had the, the one issue with whatever those costs are. It's like, well, yeah, six months ago, that was every other week, you know, and so to have that once is good and then, you know, now is all right. Just like I said to you, you. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
Know, earlier. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
You know, okay, like, what's the next thing that we automate? Right? Because really trying to pull things in because the quicker that it's like we automate stuff, then that means A, we reduce errors and B, we get the numbers faster. And the sooner we get those, the sooner we can make adjustments. So, you know, even again with the WIP and stuff, you know, eventually getting to a point where instead of you or whoever hand typing everything, we. Where is this feeding from? And let's get it all the feed in there and populate. Right? 

**Fatima Njie:**
Yeah, yeah. And. And we did a lot of, you know, like automating that stuff in July just to kind of see how well the information and how accurate the information is. Acumatica. And so we'll kind of watch it for the next few months. It's, you know, we automated the July 1, but we still have to kind of go back and check, make sure everything is kind of fitting from and to where it needs to go. So I'm hoping in the next month or so we'll get it to where we just run the reports, you know, download it in there and then everything pulls from where it needs to be. I like Job Planner, though, and I like how it's feeding into Acumatica. Procore, on the other hand, it just wasn't communicating properly. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah. Which is why we, you know, bigger reason why we left. And I think we only have, you know, Ulta Dallas is the only one on Pro Core still. Yeah, that'll be done. You know, I think very soon. I'll have to look and see, but it definitely is almost done. I just, I just got off a sales call. We've got another one in Fresno, same thing. So, you know, at least that would be cleaner in California. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
Yep. Yeah. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
So we'll go in. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
Let me know if you're ever there. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah, I mean, I'm sure I, I will fly out there at some point, but yeah, we'll, we'll. We'll go in and do air conditioning and the whole thing and then we'll go in and do a whole, you know, the same automation stuff and everything. And so. Yeah, we'll, we'll be, it will be. I'll be out there a little bit. You know, we're waiting on our, we're waiting on our license to come through. I know Maria's following up on that all the time. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
The California gc. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
Yep. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
That's going to be a lot easier, right? 

**Justin Atneyel:**
Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Oh, yeah. No, it's. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
We, we. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah, we don't. I think the only other one there was another one that asked for financials, which we already had, so we just submitted it. Which. Yeah, you know, we did. I don't know if I told you this, but we went through all that work and everything and you know, we were, we were released to, to go on this, you know, that 10 million dollar. That job and RFK pulled the ticket literally just randomly, like they canceled the meeting and, and pulled the project like. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
Wow. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
So that whole phase one, all that stuff, I mean, you know, huge waste of money, you know, by the government. Yeah. You know, and for us, Right. Like it's like, you know, 250,000 of sunk costs essentially. Which. It is what it is. Right. So I mean, you know, I. Going back, I probably would have done the same exact thing because there was no indication it wasn't going to go through. Right. I mean, hell, they released on design and everything, so. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
Wow. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
Can you capture any of those costs or. No, there's just zero there. They're not going to do. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
Yeah. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
I mean, as far as like the cost that we did to get the licensing. No, I can't capture any of that. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
Yeah, yeah. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
You know, I, you know, I requested like 100,000 to cover my design, but yeah, all the other stuff is just lost. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
Well, look, having audit financial is amazing. I'm telling you, long term, that's huge. Because now if we want to re audit financials, I love if MGO does our tax two men, because then we're in. I'm already in with aod, by the way. I already went and had lunch with them. Like I said, we're set for audits there because he is clearing a lot for us. So I'm feeling good there. But Yeah, I don't think it's a full waste because that sets you up for success. And then down the line having honored financials is huge. And the speed. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah, it is what it is, right. Sucks, but it's not. Again, it's good to have a license in Tennessee in general. We would have gotten one anyway. Now it would have been, you know, nice not to. If we would have been applying and doing it now versus, you know, back then probably would have been a little smoother and not to pay the expedited, you know, fees but again, I wouldn't have done anything different. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
Yeah. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
Hey Brandon, one last thing I wanted to tell you. I have a agentic AI partner that I'm working with out in Germany now that has. They're doing agentic AI workflows. They like. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
Agentic. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
Yeah, that's a new term in AI. Basically they use this application called N8N where they're tying together a language learning model or voice AI. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
It's N8N right? 

**Justin Atneyel:**
N8N. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah, yeah, I'm familiar with it. 

**Fatima Njie:**
Yeah. I was going to say Brandon is the AI guy. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
I would not, you know, saying I may be the A guy here at my company, but definitely not. I mean I am self taught too. 

**Fatima Njie:**
Self taught. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Trying to learn as much as I can. Literally. I'm like, I'm trying to do, I'm on Lindy AI working on doing automations in. In that it's, it's very similar. It's a no code, right Nan? You got to do some, a little bit of coding. You know, Lindy AI is no code platform, but yes. Anyway. Sorry, you were saying you were working with somebody? 

**Justin Atneyel:**
Yeah, I'm partnering with him actually. He's going to be doing AI automations internally for us, but then externally as well. He's created a AI construction voice program basically where people can communicate like change orders or changes on a job that automatically get fed to the project management and like upload those changes. And so I'm telling you that one because I'll share those with you as I discover them. And then his name is Liam. He's a German dude, very, very intelligent. I'm planning on bringing that arm on for Loom. I actually got Loom AI where we're going to start to do free discoveries for our clients and start to implement workflows. For example, like real time WIP reporting updates and like the financial package stuff. So I'm going to update you on that as it's breaking through in the next like 30 days. And if we see that there is a workflow or if there's something that's going to benefit you, I obviously will have a disclosure and making sure that you're okay with it, but I plan on starting to utilize that. And then if you're looking to use them, you can do that as well. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah, I mean, one of the things that you know is, I mean, you know, I tasked Maria and Ashley in our office, you know, to, you know, hey, I want you to go out this week and I want you to explore different AIs and tell me what you think that we can use. And you know, just if you can think to automate, you know, just as little as 10 or 15 or 20% of whatever it is that you do, that just frees you up to everything. So it's Yes, I again, that's why I harping on the team is so much about what can we automate next. Right. And that's not even AI, right. That's just pure automation. And when we started about AI being able to, I was meeting with some AI people about like, all right, so how can I get an entire brain? Right? So all of our meetings are recorded and so it's like, here's what's going on in, in each project in Notion and syncing it with Job Planner and you know, being able to talk. And then that way you could be asking the AI like, what am I forgetting? What is this like? And use it as a second brain to help people. So yeah, I think it's definitely the future. And as much as we can get in it and learn it and use it, I think it's going to pay massive dividends. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
Yeah. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
Where I'm doing that internally too, man. Crazy. But I'll keep you updated on what goes on there. Like I'll be implementing things that are front facing for you. And then if you're like, hey, you know, I'll show you the voice AI tool that they created for construction too. If you think it's interesting or cool, let me know. There's a lot we can do there. I think it would be very beneficial for me and you to meet at one point too, Brandon. I know I've said that before but like, think you're doing really cool things. I'm in the construction space doing accounting and you know, it will be literally the heartbeat for me to hear things from you directly on challenges and things that we can do better. So maybe when you're in Fresno, just literally hit me up, I'll catch a flight and come over there. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
So certainly. Yeah, for sure. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
Cool. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Well, yeah, let me know what, you know what? 

**Justin Atneyel:**
You're. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
What, you're working on that stuff, you know, I was excited to learn that stuff. And then let me know when you guys take a look at that stuff and we'll kind of go for there. I think I'm meeting tomorrow with somebody from your team. Claudine or something. 

**Fatima Njie:**
Yeah, Claudine. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
Yep. So. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
Oh, she's doing a tune in or check in. Fatima. 

**Fatima Njie:**
Yes, check in. And to finally try to get him on a fixed fee billing. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
Ah, I see. 

**Fatima Njie:**
Fixed fee. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
Yeah. Okay. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
All right, well, let me know what you think, Brandon, after the call. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
Okay? 

**Justin Atneyel:**
I don't get too deep into that, but whatever they think works. If you like it, great. If you don't, tell me. All right, man, I'll keep you updated on the taxes, financial report. I'll get to you today with feedback, and then I'll get that all updated to you. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Okay, sounds good. Thanks, guys. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
Everybody have a good one. 

**Fatima Njie:**
All right. Thank you. Thank you. 

**Justin Atneyel:**
It.
