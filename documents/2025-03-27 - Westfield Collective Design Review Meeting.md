## Transcript
**Bclymer**: Good morning, guys.
**Bclymer**: Let me get this last guy on here from the kitchen design.
**Bclymer**: We'll get started.
**Jdawson**: Well.
**Bclymer**: There we go.
**Bclymer**: Morning, Bo.
**Jdawson**: Morning.
**Bclymer**: All right, got you on here.
**Bclymer**: All right, this is our weekly design coordination meeting.
**Bclymer**: We have all the design team, architects, MEPs, our pre engineered metal building, as well as a project management team on.
**Bclymer**: I invited Bo to help us figure out these duct locations of sizing.
**Bclymer**: Is Nick on here?
**Bclymer**: There he is.
**Bclymer**: Or Nick.
**Bclymer**: All right, we'll get started here with civil drawings.
**Bclymer**: Ashton has sent over his stamp set and we are just waiting on.
**Bclymer**: And still send us back their stamp set so we can get it printed and sent over to them for our pre con to get scheduled.
**Bclymer**: Ashton, that invoice that they're referring to, who pays that?
**Nbigler**: Whoever wants to.
**Nbigler**: And it can be.
**Nbigler**: Can be a leto.
**Nbigler**: It can be the owner.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: I just.
**Bclymer**: I didn't know if they sent it to you through the portal or.
**Bclymer**: Or anything because I haven't seen an invoice come to me.
**Nbigler**: No, it'll be part of the approval documents.
**Nbigler**: When they send back the stamp plans, it'll include the invoice as well, some other forms that will need to be filled out.
**Nbigler**: But yeah, then who.
**Nbigler**: Whoever.
**Nbigler**: Doesn't matter who pays it, as long as it gets paid.
**Awoodhams**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: I emailed and called John this again today to try and get a status on getting me that stamp set.
**Bclymer**: Do you have any.
**Bclymer**: Any way to get a hold of them and try and push that so we can get it today?
**Nbigler**: I don't, unfortunately.
**Nbigler**: I wish I did.
**Bclymer**: Me too.
**Bclymer**: All right, well, the owner's finishing out their bond.
**Bclymer**: That should be done today.
**Bclymer**: And so this is the last.
**Bclymer**: Last thing, last two things we're waiting on.
**Bclymer**: And then I have the note here for the.
**Bclymer**: The load information for the gas.
**Bclymer**: Micah, are we closer to get that, getting that wrapped up for.
**Bclymer**: For Ashton to send.
**Gdesmit**: The gas?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, the gas loads.
**Gdesmit**: Yeah, I can share that.
**Gdesmit**: Unless.
**Gdesmit**: Well, no, not until we get to make up our units, so, no, not until we get all the final kitchen stuff.
**Awoodhams**: Okay.
**Ashton**: Do we not have the makeup air unit specs yet?
**Ashton**: Glenn?
**Bclymer**: I'm not sure if that's what was sent yesterday.
**Brhoades**: That.
**Brhoades**: That was sent yesterday?
**Bclymer**: Yes, that is what was sent yesterday.
**Bclymer**: Mike, let me see if Michael was on that email.
**Bclymer**: He was not.
**Bclymer**: Mike, I'm going to send that over to you now.
**Jdawson**: Okay?
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: Structural foundation.
**Bclymer**: No, no update on that.
**Bclymer**: CNC is working through their submittals and we'll edit those at the very end when we get the final reactions and the final foundation Plan from jqol.
**Bclymer**: Do you have anything other than that Jerrica that you're in need of from us?
**Bclymer**: No, I don't believe so.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: MEP Design.
**Bclymer**: All right, so, Nick, like I said, I have BO on here.
**Bclymer**: We are looking for the beam and girder layout at the mezzanine to figure out how much space we have and where to run that ducting across the corridor, up through the mezzanine and out the back of the closet.
**Bclymer**: Do you have.
**Bclymer**: Do you have anything from.
**Bclymer**: From your design team that's gotten that far?
**Bclymer**: Nick?
**Bclymer**: Nick, are you on?
**Bclymer**: Okay, come back to him.
**Bclymer**: Captivaire is looking for the CAD files, the interior elevations.
**Bclymer**: Jeff, do you have anything updated for them to get that we talked about yesterday?
**Jfield**: Yeah, I mean, from a elevation standpoint, they would just want to see what an elevation or a section cut through that back hallway.
**Jfield**: Right.
**Jfield**: And then one of the indoor beach volleyball area, essentially the west wall of that space.
**Bclymer**: Correct?
**Brhoades**: Yeah.
**Jfield**: Okay.
**Jfield**: Yeah.
**Jfield**: Let me.
**Jfield**: Let me cut a section for both of those areas and I'll just put them in a PDF and send them over.
**Jfield**: And you guys can use those as a.
**Jfield**: As a markup.
**Bclymer**: Well, we'll be able to get a.
**Jfield**: A DWG actually, of the elevation of it.
**Brhoades**: Yes.
**Jfield**: Yes.
**Brhoades**: Okay, thank you.
**Awoodhams**: Yep.
**Tom**: Can you guys hear me now?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jfield**: There he is.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Tom**: I don't know what.
**Tom**: I was talking for a long time.
**Tom**: I wasn't ignoring you guys, so.
**Tom**: My bad.
**Ashton**: There's that little mute button on there.
**Tom**: Dude, it wasn't muted.
**Tom**: That was the strange part.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Ashton**: So, Nick, we have a challenge here with this duck because, like, with the insulation, this grease duct is 20 inches in diameter.
**Tom**: Sure.
**Ashton**: And so unless we know.
**Ashton**: Is it a girder trust that runs north to south at those columns, and then the bar joists go east to west.
**Tom**: Right.
**Tom**: So, you know, the.
**Tom**: The layout that I originally was sent a long time ago would be bar joist running north and south.
**Tom**: I don't know why that would change.
**Tom**: I will find out.
**Tom**: I mean, that's.
**Tom**: This is.
**Tom**: What everyone's waiting for is the mezzanine plan and, you know, the mezzanine confirmation drawings.
**Tom**: So I'm trying my hardest.
**Tom**: It's going to be.
**Tom**: I mean, when design is done is when that will be given to us, which should be next week.
**Ashton**: Because, Jeff, like, there's only, you know, and those trusses are probably going to be 1 foot 6.
**Ashton**: What do you think they're going to be, Nick?
**Tom**: Our rafters?
**Ashton**: Yeah, the.
**Ashton**: Well, the floor joist under the floor.
**Tom**: Joists.
**Ashton**: Bar Choice, whatever.
**Tom**: Yeah.
**Tom**: So I think people up.
**Tom**: What I had.
**Tom**: I sent this to Brandon a long.
**Ashton**: Time ago because, Jeff, I'm thinking we may have to run both the grease duct and the fresh air through that closet to.
**Ashton**: To be able to get up and then go through the wall with the grease ducts, you know, above that floor assembly to get into the volleyball area.
**Ashton**: Because there's not.
**Ashton**: You're not going to have enough ceiling height or room to get that definitely underneath those bar joists.
**Jfield**: And we're at 12, 6.
**Jfield**: The ceiling is at 9.
**Jfield**: I think we talked.
**Jfield**: You know, they wouldn't be more than maybe 18 inches deep.
**Tom**: Yeah, correct.
**Jfield**: So, I mean, we got two feet, but is that not enough?
**Jfield**: I mean.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that.
**Jfield**: That may be.
**Jfield**: I mean, that still doesn't have to be at 9.
**Jfield**: In the hallway, it could be at 8.
**Ashton**: But the.
**Ashton**: So the hood.
**Ashton**: And then you think he's got to turn an elbow.
**Ashton**: So.
**Ashton**: Yeah, that's going to raise it up another four inches, probably minimum.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah, yeah.
**Ashton**: And there's a hood.
**Ashton**: It goes above the ceiling a couple inches.
**Ashton**: Is anyone from Captivair?
**Cordellm**: The hood itself will be hung at 104, I believe.
**Cordellm**: Yeah, 104 with enclosed wrappers that were enclosed around the drop ceiling inside the space, the stalls.
**Ashton**: Okay, so it'll be below.
**Ashton**: A little bit below.
**Ashton**: Okay, well, that helps.
**Ashton**: But, like, if we got three foot between the ceiling and the bottom of the deck, you got a foot and a half.
**Ashton**: Unless the joists are only a foot.
**Tom**: I thought that.
**Tom**: Jeff, do you recall what the Bar Joyce death was?
**Tom**: I thought they said it was like 24 or 28K.
**Tom**: Joyce.
**Jfield**: I don't.
**Jfield**: I don't know if it was ever fully decided.
**Jfield**: Right.
**Tom**: I mean, that's still obviously.
**Bclymer**: What we're.
**Tom**: Trying to figure out, but I'm pretty sure that's what they had told us in a meeting.
**Tom**: And I see, you know, this was.
**Tom**: This was original that we've got.
**Tom**: Are you talking, like, on the north end?
**Tom**: You're looking at the beam depths?
**Tom**: I see some W21s and some W24s that were called for originally, but that's when the whole mezzanine was beans, which we've changed to bar joy since then.
**Tom**: So that's what I have as far as, like, the beam.
**Tom**: The mezzanine beam depths.
**Ashton**: And they're running north to south.
**Tom**: So for us, beams are running east to west.
**Tom**: And it looks like the bar joist then would run north and south.
**Ashton**: Okay.
**Ashton**: So unless we could fit through a web, which I don't know which is.
**Tom**: Possible, but that's probably not ideal.
**Tom**: I don't know.
**Tom**: I don't think 20 inches or 20 inch diameter, that's a lot.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Tom**: But the point is, you're trying to run up as close as possible to a corner of where all the beams are coming together with a bar joist.
**Tom**: It could be, you know, two to three feet away from that.
**Tom**: Right.
**Tom**: That's the whole desire.
**Ashton**: Well, we got two issues.
**Ashton**: We got the fresh air coming down, and then we got the grease dirt needing to go horizontal at some point and then up.
**Ashton**: So we would be crossing.
**Ashton**: If your bar joists are running north to south, we would have to cross through them or under them to go east.
**Ashton**: So there's where our height limitations on level on the first floor, you know, they got to go through them or it's got to fit under them.
**Ashton**: And if you're saying they're 20 or 24s, there's no room.
**Tom**: Yeah, yeah.
**Tom**: Let me.
**Tom**: So basically, I'm asking for information, but you can't get it to me because I haven't given you the mezzanine layout, Right?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Ashton**: If I just had a layout of the direction of all your structure, and then we got the heights, and if we had the heights of.
**Ashton**: Of those bar joists, then we would know.
**Ashton**: You know, I just.
**Jdawson**: I don't know.
**Ashton**: We can't fit underneath it.
**Ashton**: I just don't think that's possible.
**Ashton**: And that's why I'm saying, you know, the only option would be go up through the mezzanine deck with both of them and then turn and come out into the volleyball court to go up with the grease.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Ashton**: Where we don't have any structure in.
**Bclymer**: Our way, is there?
**Tom**: What's the rush on this?
**Tom**: Am I the one rushing this question in this issue, or we just don't.
**Ashton**: Want to have to figure this out later?
**Tom**: Yeah, I.
**Tom**: I know.
**Tom**: So, you know, I don't know everything.
**Tom**: But what I can tell you is, you know, when you order metal building, Marco, Prudence, got their own stuff that they're designing and sizing.
**Tom**: And then the mezzanine is, you know, coming from new millennium.
**Tom**: So the beams are going to be from Varco.
**Tom**: The bar joists are going to be a buyout item.
**Tom**: So those.
**Tom**: There is some flexibility there, you know what I mean, as opposed to, like, changing the height of the overall building.
**Tom**: So I feel like I'm gonna get off this call, talk to Varco, and just say, hey, when are we gonna have this information, and when do we have to get you the boxed out dimension around columns like.
**Ashton**: And this may, you know, can they not just simply set a metal frame like you would typically do for an opening through a slab on deck?
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Ashton**: I mean that can really.
**Ashton**: As long as it can span across and hit a couple joists.
**Tom**: Correct, Correct.
**Tom**: So we've got the sizing and we don't think that's going to change.
**Bclymer**: It shouldn't.
**Brhoades**: Unless demand changes.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Ashton**: And it looks like all your fans are the same size curb other than the dishwasher curb.
**Ashton**: It's a little smaller.
**Brhoades**: I.
**Brhoades**: I believe so.
**Cordellm**: Yeah, that's correct.
**Ashton**: Okay.
**Ashton**: I think it was like a 19 by 19 inch curve, 23 by 23.2.
**Cordellm**: Square on those and 19 and a half on the dish.
**Tom**: For those roof curbs.
**Tom**: Or is this just the opening size in the, in the mezzanine deck?
**Ashton**: It has the spec for the curves.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Ashton**: And is that a finish dimension or does that allow for roofing?
**Ashton**: And in this case it's metal.
**Ashton**: Is that like the finished dimension of where any cladding they put on that curb?
**Cordellm**: So basically there's 3 inch flanges on each side of those curbs.
**Cordellm**: So basically we'll spot the curbs and then if they have to do flashing, they can over top of the flange.
**Ashton**: Because like the curbs for our rooftop units, Nick is actually fabricating them out of his metal building product.
**Ashton**: So they're not even.
**Ashton**: They're not providing a curve.
**Ashton**: So is this correct?
**Ashton**: Different?
**Cordellm**: These will be different.
**Cordellm**: We'll need.
**Cordellm**: I think this is a standing seam roof.
**Cordellm**: Correct, Correct.
**Cordellm**: So we'll need the specs on.
**Cordellm**: On that standing seam roof and then we can order those curbs accordingly to match the.
**Cordellm**: The roof itself.
**Tom**: So you're gonna order the roof curbs, but you want me to install it?
**Cordellm**: So are the ins like the mechanical installer walls set the curbs?
**Cordellm**: We'll just need a roofer to do any type of flashing or anything like that that's needed.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Tom**: So this.
**Tom**: I'm gonna let Alito group make the decision.
**Ashton**: You know, Nick, all I see you providing is a metal frame to support so that they can just set the curb down on that similar to like a floor slab penetration so that there's a frame there that they can attach the curb to.
**Tom**: Yeah, I mean that's one way to do it.
**Tom**: Or we can do both.
**Tom**: And it's our warranty, it's our roof.
**Tom**: We provide the roof curve based on their unit information.
**Tom**: It can go either way.
**Tom**: I would say typically it goes better if I as the Roofer supply the roof curb.
**Tom**: Not trying to, you know.
**Cordellm**: Are you talking about the exhaust fans as well and makeup error?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Tom**: I mean, I don't know what all you need or what the plan is, but right now there's four units that are going on the roof.
**Tom**: I am providing any framing needed.
**Tom**: I'm providing any subframing needed.
**Tom**: And got the loading in my building.
**Tom**: And I'm supplying and installing the roof curb.
**Tom**: Then they set down their units in it.
**Jdawson**: Gotcha.
**Ashton**: So is there anything special about these curbs that they couldn't be?
**Ashton**: Something he that Nick fabricates and installs for you?
**Ashton**: As long as the outside dimension matches the dimension on your spec, Correct?
**Cordellm**: Yes.
**Cordellm**: If he wants.
**Cordellm**: If he wants to provide the curbs and we can just take the.
**Cordellm**: The curbs out.
**Cordellm**: But they would just have to match the specs that show on the drawings themselves.
**Jdawson**: Sure.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Tom**: Like I said, it can go either way.
**Tom**: I just.
**Tom**: Yeah.
**Tom**: As the roofer and is the guy who's already doing the steel for the purlins and the roof framing, typically we see it going best to have the whole responsibility of the roof, you know, under our umbrella.
**Cordellm**: That makes sense.
**Tom**: Because if there's a roof leak, they're going to call me.
**Tom**: Even though you installed the roof curb.
**Tom**: You know what I mean?
**Tom**: Because I'm the roofer.
**Ashton**: I didn't see the makeup air units in there.
**Ashton**: Did I miss something or is that something you haven't sent yet?
**Cordellm**: They should be on the cash drones there.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Brhoades**: There's three.
**Brhoades**: Three.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Ashton**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Ashton**: I just didn't open it.
**Ashton**: My fault.
**Bclymer**: In this here that you sent Bo, right?
**Brhoades**: Yes.
**Cordellm**: It starts on sheet 15.
**Cordellm**: You might have different drawings than me.
**Cordellm**: Go back one more sheet.
**Cordellm**: Hey buddy.
**Cordellm**: Remember what sheet they're on?
**Cordellm**: There we go.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: They're.
**Cordellm**: They're.
**Brhoades**: They're spread out because they're associated with stalls installs.
**Cordellm**: Okay, gotcha.
**Bclymer**: If you have a pulled up, you can wanna share your screen.
**Bclymer**: Direct you to it.
**Bclymer**: That way don't spend most time looking through.
**Ashton**: They're all the same size unit though.
**Ashton**: For the makeup air.
**Cordellm**: Correct.
**Ashton**: How do we want to set.
**Ashton**: Can we locate those on the roof right now or do we gotta figure out this ducting first?
**Cordellm**: I would figure out the unit.
**Tom**: We zoom in a little bit.
**Jdawson**: Oh, okay.
**Tom**: Do you know how much the whole assembly weighs?
**Cordellm**: The actual makeup airway is around £484.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Cordellm**: But I would figure to figure out your duck routing first because we'll have to be 10ft away from that exhaust air for these makeup errors.
**Cordellm**: And then if you want to, we can also assist in that.
**Cordellm**: If you want to just find your duck routing, we can also review and give you guys, like, best solutions as where we can put these makeup errors as well.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Ashton**: And then as far as, like, is it at every turn you have to put a clean out in and does that take up more space or is that simply a duct door?
**Cordellm**: Yeah, it's basically just a dock door.
**Cordellm**: It won't take up any more space than the other grease duct itself.
**Ashton**: And can these.
**Ashton**: They have to be accessible.
**Ashton**: Would they be.
**Ashton**: Can they be on the bottom or do they have to be on the side or top?
**Cordellm**: They would have to be on.
**Cordellm**: On the.
**Cordellm**: The top or the side.
**Cordellm**: So if it goes to.
**Cordellm**: If you're doing like a 90 would be on the side.
**Cordellm**: We were the top.
**Cordellm**: We would just angle it up a little bit just so the grease just slopes back to the hood.
**Ashton**: All right, well, Nick will.
**Ashton**: As soon as you get that structure input to us, we'll get to work on that.
**Tom**: Yeah, that sounds good.
**Tom**: And then if you could just forward me all the stuff on that roof curb, that makeup unit that we were just looking at, I would appreciate it.
**Cordellm**: Hey, Bo, can you.
**Cordellm**: Is it possible just to send just the curb specs to him so he doesn't have to look at 15 drawings?
**Cordellm**: Would you rather.
**Brhoades**: Yeah, I can.
**Brhoades**: Nick, I.
**Brhoades**: I can get that prepared.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Tom**: They know I'm challenged.
**Tom**: I need just1.1 PDF sheet right.
**Tom**: To my email.
**Cordellm**: We can do that.
**Cordellm**: We can do that for you.
**Bclymer**: I'm gonna shoot that over right now.
**Bclymer**: Just the two that you sent me yesterday, Bo.
**Cordellm**: Just so it's easier on you to get all the measurements you need.
**Bclymer**: Anybody else need this?
**Bclymer**: That wasn't on it.
**Bclymer**: Jeff was on it.
**Bclymer**: Daniel?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Nick, you were on this email.
**Bclymer**: This is what you're looking for, right?
**Bclymer**: What we just had up?
**Tom**: Yes.
**Awoodhams**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I'll send it to you again.
**Bclymer**: So I was at the top, but you were on that email yesterday at 4:00 from Bow Fetters.
**Tom**: Yeah, sorry.
**Tom**: I.
**Tom**: I saw all the dimensions below.
**Tom**: I didn't realize that there's another roof curve in it as well.
**Bclymer**: You and Micah.
**Tom**: All right, thank you.
**Bclymer**: Speaking of Micah, do you have any update on the grease interceptor sizing?
**Bclymer**: There's a thousand gallon.
**Bclymer**: Gonna do it for us?
**Gdesmit**: I don't really yet.
**Gdesmit**: I was kind of waiting on.
**Gdesmit**: I mean, I have this.
**Gdesmit**: Some of the kitchen stuff, but for make sure it was approved.
**Gdesmit**: And the rough ends kind of on the kitchen, too, so.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: The owner did approve the.
**Bclymer**: The layout, the kitchen layout for the equipment and as well as the new walls and everything.
**Bclymer**: If you didn't.
**Bclymer**: If you didn't get that info, it was approved yesterday or the day before.
**Gdesmit**: Okay, yeah, I have all that.
**Gdesmit**: Daniel sent me the plan, so I've it all incorporated.
**Gdesmit**: I really just need to make sure we're all on the same page with what needs to be supplied where.
**Gdesmit**: So I don't know when the rough in drawings will be ready.
**Mcordray**: Same same for electrical.
**Bclymer**: Dean has the open ticket with Duke.
**Bclymer**: Last week you had working with John Schultz from Duke, submitting requests to him and is there anything updated from.
**Bclymer**: From Duke on our transformer?
**Mcordray**: I got him the load sheet and they've.
**Mcordray**: They've sent over the cost and yeah, I mean we're pretty much good to go with Duke.
**Bclymer**: Now do we need anything from them?
**Bclymer**: Do we need like an approval sheet or permit or anything like that?
**Bclymer**: What do we get in writing for that approval or for the order to, to get them out there?
**Mcordray**: I know that John Schultz had asked who he should send the bill to and I think I left the question up for Brandon and I.
**Mcordray**: I don't recall if he responded or not.
**Bclymer**: If it was recent, probably not.
**Bclymer**: He's at a.
**Bclymer**: He's in Africa this week.
**Ashton**: Africa?
**Mcordray**: Holy.
**Mcordray**: It was.
**Mcordray**: It was late last week, I think.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I think he left Thursday.
**Ashton**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Do you want to resend that over to Jesse and I?
**Mcordray**: Yeah, I can do that.
**Awoodhams**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And that was from John needing to know who's who the billing goes through.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: How does that usually go?
**Bclymer**: Does that usually go to the contractors that fall under teams design?
**Mcordray**: I.
**Mcordray**: I don't actually know.
**Mcordray**: I'd have to talk to Brandon about that, who is also actually on vacation this week.
**Mcordray**: So.
**Bclymer**: You'Ll just forward that over to me.
**Bclymer**: Alex?
**Mcordray**: Yep, doing it right now.
**Bclymer**: All right, next up, architectural design.
**Bclymer**: So the RGBW lighting is no longer being considered.
**Bclymer**: They didn't want to do that in the bars or the volleyball area at all.
**Bclymer**: And they don't want to.
**Bclymer**: They don't even want to pre wire for it at this time.
**Bclymer**: So we'll remove that.
**Bclymer**: I sent an email to Andrew and Mandy as well this morning, let them know.
**Bclymer**: Should have erased that.
**Bclymer**: We're done with the pricing there.
**Bclymer**: Kitchen sizing and layout was approved, as I just mentioned, and Jeff has been working on some rendering so we discussed yesterday.
**Bclymer**: He's going to add some, some stuff into the exterior renderings to, to give it the finishes, the masonry and everything.
**Bclymer**: We just kind of had a white Box version for the angle.
**Bclymer**: So working on getting those three renderings for the exterior for a groundbreaking.
**Bclymer**: And then the owner was requesting some interior renderings as well from the meeting that we had here at the office with Kathy, the interior designer, to just kind of get a visual on what we had discussed that day of changing the contrast, the infills and the bar and everything to give it more.
**Jfield**: Yeah, I'm going through and making sure that we have Approved to the 4.8.
**Bclymer**: Sorry, go ahead, Jeff.
**Jfield**: Yeah, I'm going through and we're making sure that we have everything updated on the interior one.
**Jfield**: So we can send him just some, some interior kind of test shots so that he can confirm that they still like the direction.
**Jfield**: And then we're working on the rest of the entourage, you know, landscaping and kind of populating the rest of those renderings of the three test shots that we sent on Wednesday.
**Jfield**: So.
**Jdawson**: Did.
**Bclymer**: You said.
**Bclymer**: You said you'd have those today or tomorrow for the exteriors?
**Jfield**: I'm hoping end of the day today, but we'll, we'll see how it goes.
**Jfield**: I gotta touch base with our guy who's working on him currently.
**Bclymer**: Say this week.
**Bclymer**: I'm sure I can get those things printed out in time.
**Bclymer**: Diamond Glass Works is going to get some samples of the black anodized.
**Bclymer**: They're going to probably bring it to you today, or I'll run and grab it and bring it over to your office today, Jeff.
**Bclymer**: Well, and I asked Pro Door to go ahead and leave their sample on at your office so that you can compare them.
**Bclymer**: I asked them, you know, if they were going to do which sheen they were going to do, and they didn't, they didn't have any alternates.
**Bclymer**: Black anodized.
**Bclymer**: It's just black anodized.
**Bclymer**: It says metallic, but it's not flat or gloss or satin, so.
**Bclymer**: Correct.
**Jfield**: Yeah, I mean, if, if they, I mean, I mean, I don't need to see a black anodized sample.
**Jfield**: I mean, anything that we're calling out as black anodized, I have an expectation of what it'll look like.
**Jfield**: I think, you know, going back to the doors again, I, I'm fully leaving that up to you guys on which way you want it to be spec'd.
**Jfield**: Like I said, if the cost was equal, then I think we just call it out as black anodized.
**Jfield**: But if it's a significant savings from a, unlike the overhead doors to do them powder coated instead of anodized, then I have no problem with, with that and the sample that he Brought over.
**Jfield**: I'm assuming everything is coming from.
**Jfield**: From pro door systems?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: The overhead doors and the counter shutters will.
**Bclymer**: So he's talking to the color cards for the coil doors for the counter shutters.
**Bclymer**: And then you have arco prudence color samples too.
**Bclymer**: So I did match off of that.
**Bclymer**: And then if we want.
**Bclymer**: If you want any physical samples beyond that, then he'll order those from there.
**Jdawson**: But he had a.
**Bclymer**: He had a swatch to run by, and he was gonna drop that off when he picked up the sample and asked him to hold off until I spoke with you about diamond getting you the sample.
**Bclymer**: So if you're good with the black anodized, like I said, the cost was significantly less by about, you know, 30 grand.
**Jfield**: So to go painted.
**Jfield**: Correct.
**Bclymer**: To go with the matte black from pro door system versus.
**Jfield**: Yeah, I talked to David yesterday.
**Jfield**: He's going to swing by today, and we're going to take a look at the VP samples to compare them against the coiling.
**Jfield**: But, yeah, other than that, I'm good with the painted over door, the painted overhead door sample, and I'm good with the anodized aluminum for the storefronts, so I don't need to see anything else beyond what I have for those.
**Bclymer**: Okay, you're talking about Dave Biddle.
**Bclymer**: All right, I'll stop.
**Bclymer**: I'll stop diamond from bringing you those and just give them the approval.
**Bclymer**: All right, last thing here.
**Bclymer**: The stair pans and railing.
**Bclymer**: Nick had given us an estimate for them, and we are.
**Bclymer**: It was kind of out of budget, so we're currently working through getting some bids for stairs and railings.
**Bclymer**: I spoke with the owner, Mike, yesterday.
**Bclymer**: They had requested the vertical infill, but the pricing that I'm getting back, we had priced it more for a cable railing style, and they priced it and pretty much hit.
**Bclymer**: Hit our budget.
**Bclymer**: So they did not price out the vertical or the mesh.
**Bclymer**: So the owners still want to see that and see the pricing and determine if they want to do an ad for the vertical infill.
**Bclymer**: So I'm working through getting that.
**Bclymer**: Some of the outfits will deliver them or, sorry, fab them, bring them, and then.
**Bclymer**: And install them.
**Bclymer**: Some of them just deliver them, and we would have Le Master do the install.
**Bclymer**: So I'm kind of getting both options.
**Bclymer**: Nick, are your guys.
**Bclymer**: Do they have the equipment ability to do stairs and railings?
**Bclymer**: Are they kind of structural guys?
**Tom**: Yes, we do.
**Tom**: I will not be hurt if you do not have my guys do that.
**Tom**: It's not a big deal.
**Tom**: Yeah, I mean, looking at our schedule, I'd say if you can find somebody and it makes sense for you to get a package, that's fine.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: I'm looking at all options.
**Bclymer**: I mean like I said, some of them will fathom and ship them to us and some of them, some of them just do stairs, some of them just do railing, some of them do it all and install.
**Bclymer**: So looking at all the options, but I just want to know if you, you were an option for the install at least.
**Jdawson**: Yep, we are.
**Tom**: So just let me know if and when you want that price and all that good stuff and we'll go from there.
**Bclymer**: We'll do I just cover the cable vertical infill or the possibly the mesh like at the Liberty location.
**Bclymer**: From those plans, last thing on this would be the exterior posts.
**Bclymer**: So the plan would be to have them send us.
**Bclymer**: Well send us enough posts to go around the exterior patio and we'll, we'll install them on site and have them pre drilled so we give them the call outs for how we want those boards spaced and how we want them mounted.
**Bclymer**: And though it doesn't sit over 1 inch by 2 inch wide pre drilled railings for us to mount the wood to the 2 inch so we'd have enough room to, to butt up the ends.
**Bclymer**: Do you think that would be enough, Nick and or Jeff, for the wood system you have going on the wood design you have going on the exterior railings.
**Bclymer**: I think two inches.
**Jfield**: I think that's more than enough.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, there's one inch more than enough because they were one by ones that didn't seem like it'd be enough to put not.
**Jfield**: I think, I think two by one.
**Jfield**: That way we can get enough space from the end of the board.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah, yeah.
**Tom**: I mean we're just going to supply the, the poor stop toe kick angle.
**Tom**: So as long as Jerrican knows, you know, how much it weighs, you know, I'm assuming that quarter inch, six inch leg and then you know, once, once we get the mezzanine information from vp then she can give the final, you know, blessing on all measurements of that angle and we'll give you that price because we still haven't given you that price yet for the pour stop.
**Tom**: Yeah, right.
**Bclymer**: Are we talking about doing a 6 inch pour stop on the exterior patio as well or is that just going to be flush?
**Tom**: I think that was the plan.
**Tom**: Unless, you know, it's obviously subject to change.
**Tom**: If you guys want to, it can be done however way you want it to.
**Jdawson**: Right?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I just, I know we Were talking about the mezzanine and having that took that, that kick in there, a toe kick and yeah, it should be.
**Jfield**: The same inside to weld to.
**Bclymer**: But I don't know about the outside.
**Bclymer**: Jeff, do you.
**Jfield**: I mean, yeah, so I would say was.
**Jfield**: Is that it it from the inside one?
**Jfield**: I would think that we would not want the lip on the outside because it will catch water.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So then we'd have a 4 inch pour stop.
**Bclymer**: Is that enough, is that enough length to weld it 4 inches versus 6 inches for that exterior rail?
**Jfield**: That's a Jericho question.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, that.
**Bclymer**: That should be fine.
**Bclymer**: Four inches versus six.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: What, what kind of time frame would it, would it take for you to get.
**Bclymer**: Get the.
**Bclymer**: I guess the cut sheet or the assembly cut of the pre drilled locations for the wood railings.
**Bclymer**: We're going with two by sixes or two by fours.
**Bclymer**: Remind me.
**Jfield**: It'D be a one by four material.
**Nbigler**: One by.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so there's one by four.
**Bclymer**: And Jeff, would that be.
**Bclymer**: Would that be part of your final plans that you give out or is that.
**Bclymer**: Would that be a.
**Jfield**: Correct.
**Bclymer**: It'll be in there.
**Jdawson**: That.
**Jfield**: Yep.
**Jfield**: Correct.
**Bclymer**: I think that's about it.
**Bclymer**: The design, deliverables, nothing has changed as far as I'm aware.
**Bclymer**: We're still working through getting our permitting, trying to push dirt by next Tuesday.
**Bclymer**: Either way, we do have our groundbreaking scheduled Next Friday the 4th at 11am if anybody would like to come and participate in that.
**Bclymer**: We'll have a tent set up and some media and chamber of commerce and mayor's office, do some photos, do some pictures with the gold shovels.
**Tom**: What time is that on Friday?
**Bclymer**: It'll be 11am next Friday the fourth on site.
**Bclymer**: So our goal is to mobilize on Tuesday, move the pad, get the silt fence up and get a path, a walking path from the YMCA parking lot.
**Bclymer**: We're intending to be able to set up parking for the groundbreaking on site at this time.
**Bclymer**: And if there's overflow parking, we'll park in the YMCA parking lot across the street.
**Bclymer**: We'll have a little wood chip mulch path from the parking lot over to the site and then our construction fence will go up the following the following week after United has some time to get all the trees out of there and get us room to put the fence in inside the silt fence.
**Bclymer**: If there's no other dates that are changed from our design deliverables, then that will wrap up our meeting today.
**Mcordray**: I, I would like electrical to be lumped into the structural and what you have labeled as MEP for 411 because we.
**Mcordray**: We still don't have the kitchen electrical rough ins and we still don't have the lighting design finalized.
**Mcordray**: And with spring break we're down a couple people, so.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so you'll take that that week after Jeff has a set done on Friday next week.
**Bclymer**: Take that following week to finish up.
**Mcordray**: Yeah.
**Mcordray**: For electrical.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Ashton**: When you say you don't have the kitchen design, you just don't have them done, but you have all the information you need to complete.
**Mcordray**: No, we.
**Mcordray**: We need the like rough in locations in the kitchen equipment schedule with the power requirements listed on the schedule.
**Ashton**: So the current schedule we have just calls out what the equipment is, but it doesn't give you the voltage.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Mcordray**: Yeah, it just says like dishwasher or.
**Mcordray**: But yeah, it doesn't.
**Mcordray**: It doesn't have power requirements on it.
**Mcordray**: And I.
**Mcordray**: My understanding is that they're in the process of creating those drawings, but I haven't.
**Mcordray**: I didn't hear when we might receive that.
**Ashton**: We have someone on here that can answer that question.
**Mcordray**: So I think that the plumbing guy was waiting for that too.
**Gdesmit**: Yeah, I am.
**Gdesmit**: Alex.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, whoever's.
**Ashton**: If you're trying to talk here must be muted.
**Ashton**: We have anyone on here from kitchen equipment?
**Bclymer**: Well, Daniel is with the kitchen equipment.
**Bclymer**: He's not on here, Bo.
**Bclymer**: And who's the other guy?
**Bclymer**: Who's up?
**Bclymer**: Who's on here?
**Brhoades**: Yeah, sorry.
**Brhoades**: Yeah, Austin hopped off.
**Brhoades**: I'm as far as the.
**Brhoades**: The kitchen equipment.
**Brhoades**: I can't really help you with that.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Cordellm**: We can.
**Bclymer**: I can send an email to Daniel and Alex and Micah.
**Ashton**: Was Daniel on earlier?
**Ashton**: And he dropped off.
**Bclymer**: He's out of the office.
**Bclymer**: He was not on the meeting at all today.
**Ashton**: Let's give him a call when this is over with.
**Ashton**: Get a hold of him.
**Bclymer**: Structural enemy key.
**Bclymer**: You'll have the design done by the week out.
**Bclymer**: So the 11th, is that.
**Bclymer**: Is that when you are able to upload to state?
**Bclymer**: Is that when you're planning or is that when it comes to us for review?
**Gdesmit**: Well, my goal was Next Thursday the 3rd, because if not, then I gotta find somebody to handle it because I will be gone for a week.
**Gdesmit**: But that all depends on Daniel getting us the drawings.
**Bclymer**: Oh, didn't you just ask for the extra week for the 11th?
**Jdawson**: That.
**Mcordray**: That was me.
**Bclymer**: That was Alex.
**Ashton**: Okay, so that's the.
**Mcordray**: The line.
**Mcordray**: You have deem drawings that.
**Mcordray**: That would be 4:11.
**Mcordray**: Dean's just doing electrical.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Jdawson**: I thought.
**Bclymer**: I thought Mike had asked that.
**Bclymer**: Sorry.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Mcordray**: Yeah, it would be more accurate to say M and P instead of M.
**Mcordray**: Well, I guess you can lump it all together now since we're.
**Mcordray**: And then you can just delete the deem line.
**Bclymer**: You guys submit it to stay under the CDR that Jeff files, right?
**Mcordray**: We can, yeah.
**Bclymer**: And is that.
**Bclymer**: Is that on 411 or is that the following week?
**Mcordray**: I mean, it just depends on when we get the kitchen information, really, but, yeah, that.
**Mcordray**: That's what we'll plan on.
**Awoodhams**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: All that looks accurate, then.
**Mcordray**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Well, actually, Spencer would be for.
**Bclymer**: No, Spencer said 442.
**Gdesmit**: That's my goal.
**Gdesmit**: 43 to send stuff to Jeff and.
**Gdesmit**: And he can file it with his if we're all done.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Gdesmit**: If not, I can see who can work on it that next week, but.
**Gdesmit**: But that's going to be tough.
**Bclymer**: All right, anchor, bolt and base plate drawings from Nick by next Friday to send to Jerrica for approval.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: All right, anybody else have anything for the design meeting today?
**Mcordray**: No, sir.
**Bclymer**: Hey, guys, thank you for your time.
**Bclymer**: Thanks for jumping on with us, Bo.
**Tom**: You guys.
**Bclymer**: Thank you, guys.
**Jfield**: Thanks.
