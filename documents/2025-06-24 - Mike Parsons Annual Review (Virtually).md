## Transcript
**Bclymer**: And you're tracking the schedule every day to see where we're at.
**Jdawson**: Right, Right.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: But.
**Bclymer**: Well, it's been good working with you so far.
**Bclymer**: I don't think I.
**Bclymer**: I still haven't met and had a chance to meet you in person.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, but Brandon, did you get down there?
**Mparsons**: Yeah, I met him whenever I went up there to do that contract negotiation meeting.
**Bclymer**: Oh, that's right.
**Bclymer**: Okay, well, eventually, I will get.
**Bclymer**: I have to get up there.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: I look forward to it.
**Bclymer**: Now that my daughter's working, she's, like, too busy for me anymore, so maybe I'll just have to go surprise visit her.
**Mparsons**: Perfect stalker parent.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I'm like, this morning talking to her, I'm like, why come?
**Bclymer**: She's like, I'm 30.
**Bclymer**: I'm almost 30 years old with everything.
**Bclymer**: It's like, okay, fine.
**Bclymer**: Crushes me.
**Bclymer**: That's like, the only thing I got.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I'm dealing with that, with some of the.
**Jdawson**: Some of the FaceTime calls back home.
**Jdawson**: Some.
**Jdawson**: Sometimes the toddler's just not in the mood, you know?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Mparsons**: Just wait another 300 years, you'll be Jesse's age and you have the same thing.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, it's like a.
**Bclymer**: It's like a circle.
**Bclymer**: It goes from they don't really care about talking to you right back to it.
**Bclymer**: But I guess it's my fault.
**Bclymer**: I never call my parents anyways.
**Bclymer**: Says, do you feel like you're being compensated appropriately?
**Bclymer**: You said, yes, I feel I'm being compensated fairly.
**Bclymer**: Additionally, the support and resources provided by Alito enhance the overall value of my compensation package.
**Bclymer**: So that's good.
**Bclymer**: What other things do you look at when you say resources, like stays, flights.
**Jdawson**: Home, you know, accommodations, those kind of things.
**Jdawson**: The major benefit, for sure.
**Mparsons**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I'm sorry, this is Kyle, but.
**Bclymer**: Kyle Henderson.
**Bclymer**: Let's see.
**Bclymer**: Hey, Kyle.
**Bclymer**: Pretty good.
**Bclymer**: Is this something, I guess, urgent or.
**Bclymer**: I just stepped out of a meeting here.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: So we'll go ahead and keep going.
**Mparsons**: I just muted him, so.
**Mparsons**: Yeah.
**Mparsons**: So the resources and stuff, as far as going home, you think that's adequate?
**Jdawson**: For sure.
**Jdawson**: For sure.
**Jdawson**: Very happy with it.
**Mparsons**: Good.
**Mparsons**: Good.
**Mparsons**: Yeah, I know it's.
**Mparsons**: It's hard being on the road.
**Mparsons**: Were you a traveler before?
**Jdawson**: I was a few years ago, but then I didn't have.
**Jdawson**: I didn't have a kid I didn't have, so I wasn't really too concerned about going home.
**Jdawson**: And their.
**Jdawson**: Their policy was once a month, and if you wanted to.
**Jdawson**: If you wanted to skip it, then you can get a.
**Jdawson**: You know, a bonus Which I usually opted for at the time.
**Mparsons**: What.
**Mparsons**: How old's your kid?
**Jdawson**: Two and a half.
**Mparsons**: Two and a half.
**Bclymer**: Nice.
**Mparsons**: Did you just have one or.
**Jdawson**: Yep, just the one.
**Mparsons**: Nice.
**Mparsons**: Have you made any costly mistakes?
**Mparsons**: If so, what were they traveling?
**Mparsons**: Such as going home without proper communication and receiving a hefty airport parking bill?
**Mparsons**: Yeah, I mean, I'd say that's the biggest thing.
**Mparsons**: I mean that's just, you know, day one stuff like, you know, it part of, you know, we give everybody in the company a credit card.
**Mparsons**: You know, we're, we're pretty liberal with it, but with that comes responsibility.
**Mparsons**: Right.
**Mparsons**: You have to treat it as if it was as your own money.
**Mparsons**: Right.
**Mparsons**: I mean, like, because at the end of the day, some of that stuff is like, you know, it's like, you know, whatever, $1200 for parking, like, what are we doing?
**Mparsons**: You know?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jdawson**: And then in addition to that, as far as actually on the job in Burnville, there was the sprinkler heads and the extra amount of screws that I ordered that didn't.
**Jdawson**: We didn't need that much.
**Jdawson**: But I still have.
**Jdawson**: But still that's.
**Jdawson**: That's something to learn from.
**Mparsons**: Yeah.
**Mparsons**: I mean, you know, that sprinkler head thing, I mean, those jobs are not hard.
**Mparsons**: You're watching one, two subs max.
**Mparsons**: Like, you know, there's should be no reason you can't go out there physically.
**Mparsons**: I mean, you could count that in 30 minutes and know exactly how many we had.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Verify it.
**Mparsons**: I mean, there's the, the biggest thing is like, you know, we have some of these jobs where there's not much going on.
**Mparsons**: Some just like Uniqlo.
**Mparsons**: Right.
**Mparsons**: We've got four subs.
**Mparsons**: Right.
**Mparsons**: Like that should be perfect.
**Jdawson**: Right?
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: And with any job, like when we look at costly mistakes, like everything adds up.
**Bclymer**: When.
**Bclymer**: If we're not watching the subs and we're not documenting things that we end up having to pay for at the end of the job when things get damaged or, you know, and especially like the sub damages something.
**Bclymer**: If you immediately take photos, you send it to their pm, you copy everybody, they know it's a problem versus if we don't say anything about it three months later, like, well, your guys did this two months ago.
**Bclymer**: They're like, whatever.
**Bclymer**: They don't remember it or something like that.
**Bclymer**: And then we end up paying for it.
**Bclymer**: So that's how you can help.
**Bclymer**: And just real quick, Brandon, just because Kyle says he may have to drive to the job site or something, he asked if the 12 inch row spacers are required for the permit.
**Mparsons**: Kyle who?
**Bclymer**: Kyle with Zion.
**Mparsons**: He said which job?
**Bclymer**: That job in Arkansas that he had US permit.
**Mparsons**: Oh, he's asking what now?
**Bclymer**: He asked if the rope, the 12 inch row spacers are required as part of the permit inspection.
**Bclymer**: I guess.
**Mparsons**: 12 inch row spacers.
**Mparsons**: I have no idea what he's talking about.
**Mparsons**: What's a row spacer?
**Bclymer**: I don't know either.
**Mparsons**: Just tell them to text me and I'll.
**Mparsons**: I'll get with them on it.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: Sorry.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: So yeah, that's, that's good.
**Bclymer**: Watching out for the jobs money.
**Bclymer**: And that's your bonus.
**Bclymer**: Like at the end of the day, you know, you get with the pm.
**Bclymer**: You should be talking to, to Keva.
**Bclymer**: Knowing what your budget is, knowing what the subs budgets are, knowing their scopes of work so that you know, you're not directing them to do things that they think is an ad or someone other sub has.
**Bclymer**: And then at the end of the job, when you look at how it, you know, did you gain money, did you lose money?
**Bclymer**: That all plays into the bonus you get at the end of the year.
**Jdawson**: Gotcha.
**Bclymer**: So have you done things above and beyond your position to say, make the company money?
**Bclymer**: If so, what were they?
**Bclymer**: So I haven't yet made or saved money directly, but I'm actively learning new tasks to enhance my future contributions, particularly in the pre construction role.
**Bclymer**: So that's good.
**Bclymer**: And what we tell everybody is, you know, read your job description, what is the superintendent supposed to be doing?
**Bclymer**: And then when you're doing things like added to that, like coming up with, you know, checklists or different things that you do that maybe aren't listed or known and then you can share those things that will help us be more efficient as a company or help other, other people in your same role or things you can do to help the pm, you know.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, those are the things you can do that over and above.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Jdawson**: Gotcha.
**Bclymer**: What are you doing?
**Bclymer**: Well, I believe I'm doing well in communicating with site personnel and clients in addition to this.
**Bclymer**: Team collaboration and proactive learning are two areas I feel I've done well with and have given myself something to build on.
**Bclymer**: So that's good.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I mean, keeping the client happy.
**Bclymer**: Like you're the face they see, you know, 90% of the time, you know, we're in meetings and that.
**Bclymer**: But you want to definitely, you know, earn their trust.
**Bclymer**: And I know as a superintendent and pm, when I was on jobs, the owners would want to give us more work because I was on the job.
**Bclymer**: It wasn't the company.
**Bclymer**: You know, people buy into the people.
**Bclymer**: So it's good.
**Jdawson**: Up here with Unico.
**Jdawson**: I've been.
**Jdawson**: Ever since I got here, I've been making it a point to try to get off on a good note with the security up here.
**Jdawson**: Just proactively.
**Jdawson**: Like the Cobry team, who wasn't technically our sub, but they weren't, they weren't listening to them.
**Jdawson**: They kept going around the wrong way, not checking in with security.
**Jdawson**: So this constant communication with them and just.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, just trying to.
**Bclymer**: Your role in that is important.
**Bclymer**: One of the things that we went back and forth with on the contract with Uniqlo and their lawyer was like wanting us to have complete control and liability for our subs and what they do in there.
**Bclymer**: And we're just like, well, there's only to a certain extent we.
**Bclymer**: If they bring a gun in and start shooting, like, we can't have control over that.
**Bclymer**: But things like you're saying getting on their ass when they're going in the wrong spot or not checking in, like, those are something we definitely have control of.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: And if they're not listening to you, you follow up with their PM or get Keva or AJ to get involved and make sure they're.
**Bclymer**: They're listening to what you're saying.
**Jdawson**: Gotcha.
**Bclymer**: Where can you improve?
**Bclymer**: Improve my documentation skills.
**Bclymer**: Documenting all communications through the project, giving clear deadlines when requesting tasks.
**Bclymer**: Need to continue gaining technical knowledge.
**Bclymer**: This will be something I'm always striving to improve.
**Bclymer**: So is this.
**Bclymer**: Is it just like everything on the computer?
**Bclymer**: Job planner, what are these things you're mentioning?
**Jdawson**: Documenting, like all conversations had with anybody involved in the project.
**Jdawson**: Not necessarily Job planner, but my own documentation in addition to that question.
**Jdawson**: Knowing when is the good.
**Jdawson**: When is the right time and just how much detail to add into certain things.
**Jdawson**: Like, I know we talked yesterday about the weekly report from last week.
**Jdawson**: Like, you know, it didn't need quite that much detail on certain things.
**Jdawson**: And this morning, my email back to you.
**Jdawson**: Suke could have used more detail.
**Jdawson**: So just.
**Jdawson**: And like in Burnville, talked to Brandon about it.
**Jdawson**: But like when the inspector came out, I pointed out the concerns that Siva had with the head spacing and Brandon pointed out to me like, he would have done it.
**Jdawson**: He wouldn't have pointed those things out.
**Jdawson**: He would have waited.
**Jdawson**: See if he said anything.
**Jdawson**: If he said we're good, which he.
**Jdawson**: He wouldn't have said anything.
**Jdawson**: I.
**Jdawson**: I know for sure.
**Jdawson**: So that's something.
**Jdawson**: That's something else.
**Jdawson**: To improve on is just knowing when exactly more detail is needed and less detail is needed.
**Mparsons**: Yeah.
**Mparsons**: Big thing is understanding your audience.
**Mparsons**: Right.
**Mparsons**: That's what we're talking about here.
**Mparsons**: Yeah, you know, obviously like, you know, an inspector, like, hey, like, do you think these things are wrong?
**Mparsons**: Like it's like that's more homework in school, you know.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Mparsons**: And so, yeah, that's good that you know that one thing on here, like documenting.
**Mparsons**: Right.
**Mparsons**: So when you have those like on site meetings, you know, one thing that I always do is as I'm walking or I'm, you know, meeting with whoever it is, clients especially, like I will just simply put my phone on voice memo and record the entire thing.
**Mparsons**: And then you can, then you can take that and you can put it in chat, gbt, have it, transcribe it, whatever.
**Mparsons**: There's a ton of stuff you can do to help do that.
**Mparsons**: And then that way you have.
**Mparsons**: Okay, this is what's agreed to, especially on this project.
**Mparsons**: As you can already see, they have short memories like, oh, I don't remember that.
**Mparsons**: It's like, that's why it's important to be very diligent.
**Mparsons**: Like things that are requested needs to be recorded, like, because we, we will get screwed on it.
**Mparsons**: I'm telling you.
**Jdawson**: I got you.
**Mparsons**: Have you done a six week look ahead yet?
**Jdawson**: I have not.
**Mparsons**: Do you know how.
**Jdawson**: Not exactly or how are you referring it to?
**Mparsons**: So a six week look ahead schedule, it's more than just taking a snip of the next six weeks on the schedule.
**Mparsons**: It's the lazy way of doing it that anybody can do.
**Mparsons**: What a six week look ahead is very detailed of what's going to happen each day with each sub.
**Mparsons**: And that way you're looking at it and saying, okay, like, are my submittals, Do I have this stuff?
**Mparsons**: Where's this material?
**Mparsons**: Like, it's a really like granular, you know, schedule that you put together.
**Mparsons**: A lot of people use Excel or whatever.
**Mparsons**: If you just, you know, if you, if you do a little research in Google, you know, and use the Internet and say, hey, like what's a, what's a commercial construction?
**Mparsons**: Six week look ahead.
**Mparsons**: Like use the tools that you have.
**Jdawson**: Okay, I got you.
**Bclymer**: And you can.
**Bclymer**: Do you use Microsoft Project.
**Bclymer**: Have you learned how to use that?
**Jdawson**: No, I used it briefly in Burn Bill, but I can look into that and get more proficient at that as well.
**Bclymer**: Because you could make, you know, you can use Excel like Brandon said, but if you want to practice, you can just make little micro schedules, your own and you can learn how to create with that.
**Bclymer**: If that's too much, if it's too cumbersome, you need to do an Excel that's pretty easy.
**Jdawson**: You can't but projects.
**Bclymer**: One other thing, like when you're communicating with the client, you know, they're expecting us to be in control and know all the answers really.
**Bclymer**: So we're unsure about something or when something's going to happen.
**Bclymer**: I would never, never put that in a report.
**Bclymer**: Or okay, any communication, you either say I'm coordinating this with the sub or we had this worked out, we'll follow up with the details or something like that.
**Bclymer**: But never say like we're working on it.
**Jdawson**: Got it.
**Bclymer**: Just doesn't sound right to when they hear it.
**Jdawson**: Understood.
**Bclymer**: Next one was what do you like that your manager does?
**Bclymer**: I appreciate my manager checks in both my well being and the project's progress.
**Bclymer**: It's appreciated.
**Bclymer**: It's appreciated.
**Bclymer**: They also consider my time to visit family.
**Bclymer**: Most importantly, they're always available for help and advice.
**Mparsons**: Must be talking about you.
**Bclymer**: I try.
**Bclymer**: I don't call, I don't get you every morning, but I try.
**Bclymer**: I try to get through the list on my way to work here.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: What time do you normally get there?
**Bclymer**: You know?
**Jdawson**: Seven.
**Bclymer**: Seven, okay.
**Mparsons**: What time are the guys showing up?
**Jdawson**: Dean, that just got here?
**Jdawson**: It's gonna be seven going forward, you.
**Mparsons**: Should be showing up before them.
**Jdawson**: Gotcha.
**Mparsons**: You know, I mean like really like what?
**Mparsons**: You know, a good superintendent is going to show up and he's going to already, you know, have it, you know, walk through and know what needs to get done, you know, and have a plan.
**Mparsons**: That way as these guys are coming in, you're already familiar with what needs to happen and you're directing them, you know, from the get go versus you showing up same time as them and then walking around and you know, familiarizing it and then coming and be after they've already started and be, oh wait a minute, go do this right.
**Mparsons**: Like you, like you are the director and so you every day, here's what we got, here's what we should be doing.
**Mparsons**: You know, yesterday this got done.
**Mparsons**: We got to get this.
**Mparsons**: Like you should know that at the back of your hand.
**Jdawson**: Gotcha.
**Bclymer**: Next one.
**Bclymer**: Where can you manage your improve?
**Bclymer**: I don't have any notable ways my manager can improve.
**Bclymer**: And so one thing, this question two means like, you know, where could you use extra help or what would help you progress and be better?
**Bclymer**: Is there, you know, is it more check ins?
**Bclymer**: Is it?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I mean I appreciate the, the Check ins and then you know, when I have something come up and then when I get feedback from either of you, it's obviously a big help.
**Jdawson**: Like in Burn Bill, Brandon pointed out multiple times just stuff that he would have done and, and I can note that going forward and learn from it.
**Mparsons**: Do you, you know what the 131 rule is?
**Jdawson**: No.
**Mparsons**: So the first one, you have a problem, okay.
**Mparsons**: You have three possible solutions.
**Mparsons**: My recommendation.
**Mparsons**: So instead of coming to whoever your supervisor is with just a problem and just putting another problem on our plates, you should come be like, here's what's got going on, here's our options, here's what I think we should do.
**Jdawson**: What was that last one?
**Jdawson**: Problem, Possible solutions.
**Mparsons**: So it's the problem, you know, possible solutions and then which one you recommend.
**Jdawson**: Okay, got it.
**Bclymer**: The next one.
**Bclymer**: Where do you want to be in five years?
**Bclymer**: So I appreciate this that you said in five years I aim to be in a leadership role, whether that be as a more seasoned superintendent or in project management.
**Bclymer**: I also hope to have expanded my technical expertise and played a significant role in completing innovative and successful, successful projects.
**Bclymer**: So, you know, it's, we should all want to be like the best at what we do before we move on, really.
**Bclymer**: Because you're a so so superintendent, then you become a so so PM and you're going to be a so so Senior PM or however you advance.
**Bclymer**: So it's good to always want to be the best in your business at what you do and learn the other things as you go along.
**Bclymer**: When you have time, you know you're going to be reviewing pay apps with sub pay apps with the pm, making sure they're correct.
**Bclymer**: You can review the owner billing, you can, you know, the schedules, like all those things are, you know, you can get into job planner, you know, doing RFIs.
**Bclymer**: I always did them myself as a superintendent.
**Bclymer**: Those are things you can get out the door and work with your PM on, make sure they're sent out and responded to.
**Bclymer**: So all those things you can learn those other skills and then, you know, everyone can transition into another field of the contractor world.
**Bclymer**: But being the best at what you're doing currently should be everyone's goal.
**Jdawson**: So yeah, for sure, just keep, just keep getting better and better.
**Jdawson**: Keep learning.
**Bclymer**: Next one, how can I help you get there?
**Bclymer**: In addition to encouraging my involvement in challenging projects, regular feedback and guidance would be invaluable in helping me refine my skills.
**Bclymer**: So yeah, hopefully every time we talk, you know, I usually like talking about the job.
**Bclymer**: What's going on and things to be looking for.
**Bclymer**: Brandon's the same way.
**Bclymer**: He's very proactive and getting with teams and, you know, sometimes I don't think about it as much of like just telling people how to do their job, but it's just from, you know, just giving them my experience.
**Bclymer**: Just because when I was there, I didn't really want anyone telling me what to do.
**Bclymer**: But, you know, it's, it's, it's something that definitely I'll work on.
**Bclymer**: I give more feedback.
**Jdawson**: Sure appreciate that.
**Bclymer**: What do you want to ask me that you haven't yet?
**Bclymer**: You don't have any looming questions and you're pleased with your experience, so that's good.
**Bclymer**: Well, we got like, when does the full time work we got going on?
**Bclymer**: When does that.
**Bclymer**: Where's the first break in that?
**Jdawson**: The first break.
**Bclymer**: You got electricians in there.
**Bclymer**: When do they.
**Bclymer**: When do we have a lag in activities on our end?
**Jdawson**: It's going to be the July 4th weekend.
**Bclymer**: But does it start back up the week after or like what is.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that, that follow that following Monday.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: You got your trip home already set up?
**Jdawson**: I haven't, I haven't booked it or anything, but that's what I'm looking at right now because I need to see exactly if they're gonna be looking to work on the third or is that a travel day back for them?
**Jdawson**: So I'll have that planned out here soon.
**Jdawson**: I know starting in August.
**Jdawson**: That's when we have.
**Jdawson**: That's when, you know, we have rack installation going and fire sprinkler.
**Jdawson**: So I mean, that's when we're going to have a lot more people on.
**Bclymer**: Site and then that sprinkler work goes on to when?
**Mparsons**: I mean, twice.
**Mparsons**: It'll go.
**Mparsons**: Yeah, it'll go on to the end of the project.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we're looking at having the first plan B completed by the new year.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: I'm just thinking more like I don't know the schedule that well.
**Bclymer**: Is there a couple weeks in between where we don't have while we're waiting on the racking to go up?
**Bclymer**: Is all I'm thinking is where we plan on.
**Bclymer**: If you need to help out with another job, it'd be helpful if we got plenty of notice on when those times are or.
**Bclymer**: And Brandon, I don't think you plan on having him there when we don't have subs working if it's just the owner's sub.
**Mparsons**: Correct.
**Mparsons**: We just need to, you know, figure out that schedule and, you know, adjust what we can adjust.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: I'm meeting with Kevin later today, but I'll.
**Jdawson**: I'll be in communication with him and get that nailed down and communicate that to you guys.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Because if we have thing, you know, if this radio American Express goes, you know, that may not be full time.
**Bclymer**: And so it'd be something where, if you do, if it works out, you could be up there for a week and in between the other time.
**Bclymer**: So I would just get that.
**Bclymer**: Get something preliminary on there so we know what that would look like.
**Jdawson**: Okay, Understood.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: But overall, we're glad you're with us and you definitely, like, we don't have anyone, like, just to go up there and do these things.
**Bclymer**: So it's appreciated that, you know, the different people like different things.
**Bclymer**: So it's good to have someone on board that enjoys being out there and getting things done.
**Jdawson**: Likewise.
**Jdawson**: I've enjoyed.
**Jdawson**: I've enjoyed it, and I look looking forward to the future.
**Mparsons**: Yeah, definitely think you have more potential.
**Mparsons**: So just keep learning, growing, you know, remember, like, work on getting 1% better every day.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yes, sir.
**Bclymer**: That's one thing, you know, Brand has mentioned before.
**Bclymer**: Like, you know, each construction project's a little bit different, a little bit new, and some are drastically different and new.
**Bclymer**: So any of the types of construction you haven't been on before, you know, YouTube videos, whatever, online, just looking all that up and, you know, learning on your own different methods and means and.
**Bclymer**: And sequences of construction, because then when we do land those jobs, you know, you'd be able to step right in and not be just going in blind, you know, and as you learn more and more, really, construction is maybe different types of materials, but it's kind of the same process you get into and how you do it.
**Bclymer**: So the more you learn, the easier it'll be to take that new job with new kinks and wrinkles in it and you can figure out, so.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Good deal.
**Jdawson**: Mike, thank you very much.
**Bclymer**: Thank you.
**Bclymer**: We'll see.
