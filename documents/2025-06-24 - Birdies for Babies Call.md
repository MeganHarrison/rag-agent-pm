**Aalarson03**: It's not as special.
**Aalarson03**: No.
**Aalarson03**: But I get our company, they give us the day off, and so it's like one of our holidays.
**Aalarson03**: So that's always nice that I don't have to go see the office.
**Gstrati16**: That's awesome.
**Ataylor**: That is a really cool perk.
**Aalarson03**: Yeah, it's.
**Eawente**: It's.
**Aalarson03**: It seems so simple, but it's so great.
**Ataylor**: It's the simple things for, like, you know, employee retention.

**Aalarson03**: I just texted Liz.
**Aalarson03**: I'm like, his note takers here.
**Aalarson03**: But why isn't AJ here?

**Ataylor**: It's crazy.
**Eawente**: What is it like?
**Eawente**: It, basically, it takes notes with what we're saying and he just can read it later.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, it's like.
**Esherrill2018**: What an asshole that he can't just show up on his own, but at least he cares enough.
**Ataylor**: To read the notes for later, you know?
**Ataylor**: It's like taking minutes of a meeting.
**Eawente**: AJ's our secretary now.
**Eawente**: I guess Steve should be getting on.

**Eawente**: I Think.
**Eawente**: And then Tony and Aaron just emailed.
**Eawente**: They're stuck in another meeting.

**Lani.johnston1**: I just don't.
**Lani.johnston1**: I'm not hungry anymore.
**Lani.johnston1**: When you get old like me, you don't like, you don't really eat like you used to.
**Eawente**: I'm getting old and I'm just eating more.
**Lani.johnston1**: No, I just don't.
**Lani.johnston1**: I drink more, but that's because I have a wife and kids that drive me crazy sometimes.
**Esherrill2018**: How is it possible that you drink more?
**Lani.johnston1**: Oh, God.
**Lani.johnston1**: Hey, have you ever.
**Lani.johnston1**: This is what I did this one time to Kristen and she'll like, I'll never do it again, but I'll do it to you.
**Lani.johnston1**: You know this.
**Lani.johnston1**: Know your role.
**Lani.johnston1**: Shut your mouth.
**Esherrill2018**: I.
**Esherrill2018**: I wouldn't do that to your wife again if I were you.
**Lani.johnston1**: Nor would I.
**Lani.johnston1**: I'll never do it again.
**Lani.johnston1**: It was a funny joke, but she didn't think it was funny at the time.
**Esherrill2018**: And I'll give you one.
**Esherrill2018**: I'll give you one time too.
**Esherrill2018**: No.
**Lani.johnston1**: Yeah.
**Lani.johnston1**: I'll do it to you whenever I want.
**Lani.johnston1**: I don't care about you, trader.
**Lani.johnston1**: I love you, buddy, but that's it.
**Esherrill2018**: Hey, are you playing golf in this outing, by the way?
**Lani.johnston1**: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Lani.johnston1**: I'm.
**Lani.johnston1**: I'm.
**Lani.johnston1**: I am.
**Lani.johnston1**: I have.
**Lani.johnston1**: I normally play with McGregor and he can't come down.
**Lani.johnston1**: I normally play with my son, so I normally play with my brother McGregor and then my son, if he can play.
**Lani.johnston1**: But Carter's having his tonsils and an Amoids or androids, I don't know what they're called.
**Lani.johnston1**: Something out on adenoids.
**Lani.johnston1**: That's what they're all.
**Lani.johnston1**: Thanks, Anna.
**Lani.johnston1**: So he's having surgery on the 7th, so he can't play.
**Lani.johnston1**: My brother's got member guest at Bridgewater so he can't play.
**Lani.johnston1**: And so now I'm.
**Lani.johnston1**: I'm.
**Lani.johnston1**: I'll have a foursome, but I'm.
**Lani.johnston1**: I have a foursome.
**Lani.johnston1**: I'm not worried about it.
**Lani.johnston1**: Put me in.
**Lani.johnston1**: Sign me up.
**Laurenwakefield**: I'll just ask the Parkers.
**Laurenwakefield**: Steve, because we still have to get them signed up too.
**Laurenwakefield**: But they all told.
**Lani.johnston1**: I saw a couple of them are signed up.
**Laurenwakefield**: Are they okay?
**Lani.johnston1**: Yeah.
**Lani.johnston1**: I just played an outing on Saturday with Cade and Stacy Parker and then I've got a buddy that was wanting to put a.
**Lani.johnston1**: Force them together.
**Lani.johnston1**: So we'll.
**Lani.johnston1**: We'll have a.
**Lani.johnston1**: We'll have a group if not two groups still to put in.
**Lani.johnston1**: But all my guys this year.
**Lani.johnston1**: I don't know if it Just because we moved up the date or what, but all my guys are.
**Lani.johnston1**: They're.
**Lani.johnston1**: I'm striking out right now.
**Eawente**: Sorry.
**Eawente**: We're at 108.
**Lani.johnston1**: We'll get to.
**Lani.johnston1**: We'll get to 144 easy.
**Lani.johnston1**: We still got three weeks.
**Lani.johnston1**: Everybody signs up the last couple of weeks.
**Lani.johnston1**: So we'll get there.
**Lani.johnston1**: Ain't no thing but a chicken wing.
**Eawente**: All right, on that note, let's get started.
**Lani.johnston1**: Yeah, let's get started.
**Lani.johnston1**: Because my dinner party still moved to the back of my house, so it's.
**Eawente**: I'm not even gonna ask.
**Eawente**: I was gonna say, how is the back of your house?
**Lani.johnston1**: But it's awesome.
**Lani.johnston1**: You need to come down and check it out.
**Lani.johnston1**: We redid it this year.
**Esherrill2018**: Really?
**Eawente**: I'm at the construction zone next door.
**Eawente**: How you feeling?
**Lani.johnston1**: Don't get me going.
**Eawente**: I know.
**Eawente**: All right, all right.
**Lani.johnston1**: That he just pissed me off again.
**Lani.johnston1**: He's killed half my.
**Lani.johnston1**: I just.
**Lani.johnston1**: You don't kill that dude.
**Lani.johnston1**: Excuse my language.
**Lani.johnston1**: Oh, I don't like my next door neighbor at all right now.
**Lani.johnston1**: But anyway, let's go, let's go.
**Eawente**: Currently, we are at 108 golfers, 27 foursomes.
**Eawente**: We, like Steve said, none of my.
**Eawente**: Nobody we know has signed up.
**Eawente**: Just so you know.
**Eawente**: So sorry.
**Eawente**: We've got people, we're getting people.
**Eawente**: But yeah, we will hit 144, no problem.
**Eawente**: Um, so keep in mind, if there are people that are like, dying again, they need to sign up because we have.
**Eawente**: We will have to shut it off if it gets that many golfers.
**Eawente**: 34 reception guests, I think is what I have.
**Eawente**: Same thing.
**Eawente**: I don't think we'll have to shut that off.
**Eawente**: Last year we did with Liz and AJ I think it was like 2:20, I want to say.
**Eawente**: And we were like, at capacity.
**Eawente**: Like, we don't have space.
**Eawente**: Just that many people, but we should be good.
**Eawente**: I know you had some questions about start times, so we can run through those real quick.
**Eawente**: Reception start time, 6ish.
**Eawente**: Like, people can get there if they want.
**Eawente**: Like, open bar will start.
**Eawente**: That's what time we started last year.
**Eawente**: The program itself probably won't start to like six or so.
**Eawente**: Sorry.
**Eawente**: Around seven, probably.
**Eawente**: And all that's pending, like, how long golf takes.
**Eawente**: So obviously if we have two foursomes on every single hole, it may take.
**Lani.johnston1**: A little bit longer.
**Eawente**: We'll try to keep the speed and the pace of play going, but it'll kind of fluctuate a little bit.
**Ataylor**: I'm hoping.
**Eawente**: Anna, are you good?
**Ataylor**: So, heck, yeah.
**Lani.johnston1**: You will.
**Lani.johnston1**: If you got 108 right now, you'll, You're, I mean, you're only, you're.
**Lani.johnston1**: Do the math.
**Lani.johnston1**: I mean, you're 30 something players off.
**Lani.johnston1**: Nicole's got a couple foursomes.
**Lani.johnston1**: I, I, I'll have a foursome or two and then you'll have some friends, like last minute signups.
**Lani.johnston1**: Sorry to cut you off, Nicole, but you'll.
**Lani.johnston1**: You'll get two groups.
**Lani.johnston1**: You'll get there.
**Laurenwakefield**: Yeah, we have at least two foursomes as well.
**Laurenwakefield**: Minimum.
**Lani.johnston1**: I mean, so right there you got two, that's 12, that's 16, maybe 22 players.
**Lani.johnston1**: You, I mean, you got, you got players coming.
**Eawente**: Yeah, you guys are in a great spot.
**Lani.johnston1**: Actually.
**Lani.johnston1**: Put me down.
**Lani.johnston1**: Just sign me up and I'll.
**Lani.johnston1**: I'll give you my credit card later so I don't lose my spot.
**Esherrill2018**: That's not the way it works, son.
**Eawente**: My husband said, Liz, you were very nice to wait to sign people up because he said, and you snooze, you lose.
**Eawente**: I'm like, sir, you're not even signed up.
**Eawente**: So yeah, I will.
**Eawente**: I'll just sign up.
**Eawente**: I can pay for you, Steve.
**Eawente**: I'll just sign up.
**Lani.johnston1**: No, no, I can pay for it.
**Laurenwakefield**: I.
**Ataylor**: Don't worry.
**Lani.johnston1**: I'm not worried about the money.
**Lani.johnston1**: I'm just trying to.
**Eawente**: Alright, moving on.
**Lani.johnston1**: Don't do that.
**Lani.johnston1**: I'll just.
**Lani.johnston1**: I'll sign up tomorrow.
**Lani.johnston1**: I'll do that tomorrow.
**Eawente**: Perfect.
**Eawente**: Right job.
**Eawente**: Anna, are you good with checking people in?
**Aalarson03**: Yes.
**Aalarson03**: Remind me what time.
**Eawente**: Okay.
**Eawente**: 10:00am Great.
**Eawente**: How do you feel about.
**Eawente**: How many people.
**Eawente**: How many people do you need?
**Aalarson03**: Maybe one.
**Eawente**: Okay.
**Aalarson03**: So aren't we putting polos on cards?
**Eawente**: Well, so we have.
**Aalarson03**: Actually.
**Eawente**: Yeah, we have bags.
**Eawente**: So they got bags and like little tea kind of sets.
**Eawente**: I think they are something donated and we have like some coupons and some.
**Eawente**: Whatever that people have sent us.
**Eawente**: They're on there.
**Eawente**: So we.
**Eawente**: We'll just have everything in bags.
**Ataylor**: I was gonna say I only got.
**Ataylor**: I only got like 120 of those.
**Ataylor**: Should I be asking them for.
**Ataylor**: You know, I don't know.
**Ataylor**: Like.
**Lani.johnston1**: What?
**Ataylor**: I can't do math.
**Eawente**: Really quick.
**Lani.johnston1**: More.
**Esherrill2018**: 144.
**Eawente**: You got 120.
**Eawente**: Yeah.
**Eawente**: So you need 24 more.
**Eawente**: Okay, if they can send more, then yes.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, perfect.
**Lani.johnston1**: If they can, great.
**Lani.johnston1**: If not, then anybody that's involved with Birdies for babies doesn't need one.
**Lani.johnston1**: Yeah, just right.
**Lani.johnston1**: Like I'm just gonna make that executive decision.
**Lani.johnston1**: Sorry, Nicole.
**Laurenwakefield**: Exactly, that's what I was gonna say.
**Laurenwakefield**: Like AJ doesn't need one.
**Laurenwakefield**: His.
**Lani.johnston1**: I don't need one.
**Laurenwakefield**: Our family's fine.
**Eawente**: I'm just.
**Eawente**: I'm gonna interrupt everybody for ease.
**Eawente**: I need everything to be the same.
**Eawente**: Thank you.
**Lani.johnston1**: There you go.
**Eawente**: If it's not.
**Eawente**: If it's not an orange bag, that's fine.
**Aalarson03**: But.
**Eawente**: It'S got to be Labeled, because otherwise it's going to be a shit show.
**Eawente**: So my plan, hopefully, if this works for Todd, is to get the shirts the night before, and I will have labels for everybody, and every single bag will have a label on it, and their shirt will go in the label.
**Eawente**: That way, we're not worried about exchanging shirts.
**Eawente**: We don't have to thumb through things.
**Eawente**: Here's your bag.
**Eawente**: Thanks for coming.
**Eawente**: Have a great day.
**Lani.johnston1**: Yep.
**Ataylor**: Perfect.
**Eawente**: Everything has to be in a bag.
**Aalarson03**: Yeah.
**Aalarson03**: And so if that's how it is, Nicole, I'm.
**Aalarson03**: I only need one person, and if you need me to find that person, I totally can.
**Aalarson03**: That's on issue.
**Aalarson03**: And then if you need help with organizing the shirts into the bags the night before, I can help with that as well.
**Aalarson03**: Just let me know.
**Eawente**: I think Lonnie's good.
**Aalarson03**: You will be having a child, Liz.
**Eawente**: Yeah.
**Laurenwakefield**: But we'll have, like, a solid week or two before, which is not what we were expecting.
**Aalarson03**: Yeah, but I didn't expect to be in the hospital for a week, so.
**Eawente**: No.
**Aalarson03**: You get, like, some grace.
**Lani.johnston1**: I was gonna say section.
**Eawente**: Is it a scheduled C section?
**Eawente**: No.
**Eawente**: Did you tell me that it's not.
**Laurenwakefield**: Hoping, Not a C section.
**Laurenwakefield**: Okay.
**Eawente**: I was gonna say because, girl, you need to rest.
**Ataylor**: We will happily do that as well.
**Ataylor**: The night before.
**Eawente**: Yeah.
**Eawente**: I'll keep you posted.
**Eawente**: Are you raising your hand?
**Esherrill2018**: I am.
**Esherrill2018**: Yes.
**Eawente**: I like this new rule.
**Esherrill2018**: That's how you do it, right, Anna?
**Esherrill2018**: On teams.
**Aalarson03**: Not at our company, but I love it.
**Eawente**: All right.
**Eawente**: What winter are you going to throw at me?
**Esherrill2018**: I am not going to be in.
**Esherrill2018**: I'm not going to be in the night before.
**Esherrill2018**: I have an outing on Thursday, so.
**Esherrill2018**: I could ship boxes, though.
**Eawente**: Do you want to do that, or do you want to just wait till.
**Eawente**: What time would be there Friday start time.
**Eawente**: Will you ship boxes?
**Esherrill2018**: I think it'll be easier for me to ship.
**Esherrill2018**: So you guys will have them in.
**Lani.johnston1**: Advance if you want to ship.
**Lani.johnston1**: And if Nicole's okay with it, she can ship them to my house and I can load all the boxes up in the bed of my truck.
**Eawente**: That was nice of you to ask.
**Eawente**: I'm gonna put them in bags before we take the boxes to the thing so you can pick them up from my house and take them.
**Lani.johnston1**: Whatever works perfect.
**Lani.johnston1**: Yeah.
**Eawente**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: What do the.
**Ataylor**: Real quick.
**Ataylor**: Todd, I was just curious about this.
**Ataylor**: What do the sweatshirts look like?
**Ataylor**: Do they have the Birdies for Babies emblem?
**Esherrill2018**: Yeah, they're.
**Esherrill2018**: The Birdies for Babies is on the.
**Esherrill2018**: On the sleeve.
**Esherrill2018**: Let me.
**Esherrill2018**: Let me go.
**Esherrill2018**: I've been meaning to send a picture, but I ordered them so long ago, I don't know where.
**Esherrill2018**: I'm gonna go.
**Esherrill2018**: Grab mine real quick and then I'll just hold it up so you guys can see.
**Esherrill2018**: So continue.
**Lani.johnston1**: Sorry.
**Ataylor**: I feel like I'm derailing us quite a bit.
**Ataylor**: I apologize.
**Lani.johnston1**: No, you're.
**Eawente**: You're fine.
**Eawente**: So it's up to you about the bags.
**Eawente**: I'll leave it.
**Eawente**: I don't care.
**Eawente**: But if not, I can get 25.
**Eawente**: I don't even care.
**Eawente**: I mean, if it's Birdies for babies, it's Target bags, whatever.
**Eawente**: It won't be Target bags.
**Eawente**: If you know me.
**Eawente**: It's not gonna be Target bags, but.
**Ataylor**: Everybody can let you know.
**Eawente**: And then we'll do some sort of alphabetical.
**Eawente**: Easy for you to access Anna, and literally just pull.
**Eawente**: And it's going to be the same thing.
**Eawente**: We have hello Fund again.
**Eawente**: So we have a lot more phone numbers this year than we did last year.
**Eawente**: So we're going to try to push for them to get their credit cards and stuff on file ahead of time as much as we can.
**Eawente**: Last year, I feel like there was something with the lists.
**Eawente**: It was hard to find people or cross people off or something, but I don't remember why.
**Eawente**: Was it.
**Eawente**: What would be helpful?
**Eawente**: Does it need to be an alphabetical order with.
**Eawente**: Or what was.
**Eawente**: I feel like the line said she couldn't figure.
**Eawente**: Like it was thumbing through and it was chaotic or something.
**Aalarson03**: I think it's maybe sometimes when they, like sub, they're like, oh, so and so couldn't be there.
**Aalarson03**: Like they give their name and it's like, oh, wait, like who are.
**Aalarson03**: Who actually signed up.
**Aalarson03**: So I don't think how you had it necessarily was an issue.
**Aalarson03**: So I think having the team captain or who they're with is helpful.
**Esherrill2018**: But you'll.
**Esherrill2018**: You'll have an alphabetical list and a pairings list.
**Esherrill2018**: So if they're subbing in for somebody, it'll say what whole number they're on.
**Esherrill2018**: You can go to the pairings and say, okay, you're playing with this guy.
**Esherrill2018**: And then.
**Esherrill2018**: And that's a replacement.
**Eawente**: Yeah.
**Aalarson03**: No, an issue.
**Eawente**: Okay.
**Aalarson03**: Do you need us to bring.
**Aalarson03**: Or me to bring my computer again?
**Eawente**: Yeah.
**Eawente**: And your little usb.
**Eawente**: Huh.
**Aalarson03**: Huh.
**Aalarson03**: Okay.
**Eawente**: I think told me only one card reader worked last year or something.
**Eawente**: So I'll have to mess with those and see.
**Laurenwakefield**: Okay.
**Eawente**: And I'll just order another one.
**Eawente**: If for some reason didn't work.
**Aalarson03**: But is.
**Aalarson03**: Remind me, is Lonnie.
**Aalarson03**: Did you say she's not able to come this year?
**Eawente**: No, she is.
**Eawente**: Jeff's not able to play, but she's.
**Eawente**: I'm pretty sure she said she'd be able to come.
**Eawente**: She just texted me the other day.
**Aalarson03**: Is she doing registration or do you need me to find someone?
**Eawente**: I think I'll ask her again.
**Eawente**: No, she said I'll be there all day, so.
**Eawente**: Yeah, she should be good.
**Aalarson03**: Okay.
**Eawente**: You took into it like you did last year, that'd be great.
**Eawente**: Steve, launcher.
**Laurenwakefield**: Okay.
**Eawente**: And she's good with the partner?
**Lani.johnston1**: Yeah, she's looking forward to it.
**Eawente**: Okay, perfect.
**Eawente**: Awesome.
**Eawente**: And then the other volunteers, we need two separate people and you guys have a ton of volunteers that signed up.
**Eawente**: But just, just to think about it.
**Eawente**: You can shoot me names later if you're like, okay, these people would be good.
**Eawente**: The two types of ticket sales, we like to keep them separate just because it's separate pots.
**Eawente**: So raffle and like 50, 50 raffle.
**Eawente**: And then the prize raffle.
**Eawente**: So whoever you think would be good, like tickets, outgoing, personable, like getting people to buy tickets would be great.
**Eawente**: Those two people need to obviously be there in the morning around 10:30.
**Eawente**: They'll prep and we'll go through with them.
**Eawente**: What, they do that for that and then same people, if possible.
**Eawente**: Since they already know how to do it, we'd like them to do it at the reception as well.
**Eawente**: Just like at the beginning they can be seated during like program and dinner.
**Eawente**: But like before things start, if they could, they can be committed to do that too.
**Eawente**: That'd be great.
**Eawente**: Yeah.
**Eawente**: And then I do need somebody like really fun.
**Eawente**: So Jenna and Russ did this last year.
**Eawente**: They were a past couple and she is like the most out there person ever.
**Eawente**: She's amazing.
**Eawente**: She's just like, you just can't say no to this girl.
**Eawente**: So we need somebody just like her.
**Eawente**: Get it?
**Eawente**: So they will be there all day long.
**Eawente**: If they can bring a tent, that'd be great.
**Eawente**: If not, I.
**Eawente**: I have one.
**Eawente**: I think somewhere we can do like a pop up tent.
**Eawente**: I bring like a fan, water, things like that.
**Eawente**: And they'll basically just be monitoring to hit it, to get hit.
**Eawente**: You hit it, you get it.
**Eawente**: So the collecting money for that and then obviously regulating, you know, you hit something, you get it, you don't, you're out of luck, sort of.
**Eawente**: And that will be all day.
**Eawente**: So around 11 o' clock probably would be start time.
**Eawente**: They'll be responsible for putting like all the bottles out and stuff like that too.
**Eawente**: And we can go more detail once we know who you have Too.
**Eawente**: But think about those people so that we can just cross that off.
**Eawente**: Everybody else can just be floaters.
**Aalarson03**: Okay.
**Eawente**: We don't obviously need a ton of people and I know you have a ton of people that were, are interested in helping.
**Eawente**: Obviously we won't say no, but those are like the main people that we need.
**Eawente**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: How many floaters?
**Eawente**: I mean, it's more so for like if somebody's like, no, I am volunteering and I don't want to like, I have to be here.
**Eawente**: Like, I really don't need anybody else.
**Lani.johnston1**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Okay, got it.
**Gstrati16**: We just, we, we have some family members that are like, I don't golf, but I want to be there.
**Gstrati16**: And we're like, we really appreciate it, but we really don't need you to come until dinner.
**Gstrati16**: So we just wanted to like.
**Eawente**: Okay, cool.
**Laurenwakefield**: Yeah.
**Eawente**: The first hour or first two.
**Eawente**: Two hours like before basically is like the only time.
**Eawente**: And then other than that there's literally like nothing.
**Eawente**: I don't say nothing.
**Eawente**: Like it'll be nice to have like a hand or two, but yeah, Lonnie and you know, other people that will be there all day too.
**Eawente**: So.
**Eawente**: Got it.
**Eawente**: Cool.
**Eawente**: What were you gonna say, Liz?
**Laurenwakefield**: I was gonna say too, like something to keep in mind last year because we like had a lot of like we were basically full with all the golf carts were being used.
**Laurenwakefield**: I think Nicole maybe had like one golf cart just in case.
**Laurenwakefield**: But like even that like not all the time.
**Laurenwakefield**: So just to like set your volunteers expectations or like your guys' like Gina, I don't know if you're playing but like last year like I couldn't like really ride around.
**Laurenwakefield**: There was like maybe one or two times I got to drop in.
**Laurenwakefield**: But just so you know, like at least last year we did not have like a cart to go around and like.
**Eawente**: Yeah, got it.
**Eawente**: Yeah, we'll have like she said, we'll have one or two assuming everybody assuming it's full.
**Eawente**: But like we need those for like Tito's.
**Eawente**: If they run an ice, they're going to call me and say, hey, I need ice.
**Eawente**: So you have to run out and help them.
**Eawente**: Same thing with the launcher.
**Eawente**: If they need like the people that are on the holes, if they need things, we just have to be, be able to help them.
**Eawente**: So that's the reasoning behind that.
**Eawente**: And we just can't control how many golf carts, unfortunately that's the course of that.
**Eawente**: So.
**Eawente**: Yeah.
**Esherrill2018**: Do you want, do you want to check with Aaron on rental carts, see how much they are?
**Eawente**: Oh, I could do you Want me to do that?
**Esherrill2018**: Yes.
**Ataylor**: See?
**Esherrill2018**: See how much they be.
**Eawente**: Okay.
**Esherrill2018**: It might be.
**Esherrill2018**: It might be worth it.
**Esherrill2018**: Just so we have enough.
**Esherrill2018**: So we, the volunteers have them and then you guys having to run around that type of thing.
**Eawente**: Okay.
**Eawente**: Okay.
**Eawente**: You don't have any.
**Eawente**: Nobody's asked you sponsor wise to set up at a hole.
**Eawente**: Correct?
**Eawente**: Correct.
**Eawente**: Okay.
**Eawente**: And that's fine.
**Ataylor**: There might be one.
**Ataylor**: My buddy Oscar, who's with Indie Solar, maybe will want to.
**Ataylor**: He's also playing, so I don't know.
**Gstrati16**: Something of anything.
**Eawente**: Like.
**Eawente**: I don't think he would be at the hole.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, I'll check with him.
**Eawente**: Okay.
**Eawente**: I'm just asking because they'll typically be like, okay, can we get a table or can we get a tent or whatever.
**Eawente**: They have to bring all their own stuff.
**Eawente**: Like one table available and it'll go to Tito's and I'll probably have to.
**Eawente**: I'll probably bring more tables.
**Eawente**: I think we had to do that last year, right, Liz?
**Eawente**: Bring more tables for something.
**Eawente**: Yeah, yep.
**Eawente**: So anybody that wants to set up.
**Eawente**: It's.
**Eawente**: That's fine.
**Eawente**: They can do that let us know ahead of time so we can make sure they're on a poll that's not crazy far away or that's, you know, not shared or something.
**Eawente**: But they'll have to bring all their own stuff.
**Aalarson03**: If it is just a fire.
**Aalarson03**: Could they put that in the bag, Nicole, or.
**Aalarson03**: Yeah, that's not part of the sponsorship level.
**Gstrati16**: Yeah, that's a good idea.
**Lani.johnston1**: Yeah.
**Aalarson03**: Okay.
**Aalarson03**: It just could be.
**Aalarson03**: At ease.
**Gstrati16**: Yeah, that's a good idea.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, that would be good.
**Ataylor**: Let us know about the rental carts because I.
**Ataylor**: I definitely think it would be nice for like G to have one to run around and say hi to everybody that day.
**Gstrati16**: But I don't need one.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, yeah.
**Eawente**: Yep.
**Eawente**: I'll keep you posted there.
**Eawente**: What else, Todd?
**Eawente**: Do you need any logos?
**Eawente**: Do you have all the logos?
**Esherrill2018**: I think we do.
**Esherrill2018**: I'll double check.
**Esherrill2018**: Yeah, I'll double check, but I think we do.
**Eawente**: Okay.
**Eawente**: And then I gotta double check on signs.
**Eawente**: I think I have one welcome sign because all of them were custom last year.
**Eawente**: So, I mean, are you doing.
**Esherrill2018**: Let me know what you need outside of sponsorship signs.
**Esherrill2018**: I'll probably get that going here soon because I'll be.
**Esherrill2018**: I'll be in Orlando all week next week for volleyball.
**Eawente**: Okay.
**Gstrati16**: My sister's there actually.
**Lani.johnston1**: Yeah.
**Esherrill2018**: Anyone who plays volleyball is going to be there this month.
**Gstrati16**: So she's there right now.
**Esherrill2018**: Yep.
**Eawente**: And then the only sponsorships that need to pay.
**Eawente**: Did you.
**Eawente**: Is Tito's.
**Eawente**: And then Drew Schroeder for Matchlink.
**Eawente**: Is that correct?
**Esherrill2018**: Yeah, correct.
**Eawente**: Okay.
**Eawente**: Okay.
**Eawente**: Whoa.
**Eawente**: What did I do?
**Esherrill2018**: That was.
**Esherrill2018**: That was me.
**Esherrill2018**: Can you see that?
**Esherrill2018**: Pull over.
**Lani.johnston1**: That's it.
**Aalarson03**: Oh, you have our screen over it.
**Lani.johnston1**: Share.
**Esherrill2018**: You can see that or.
**Esherrill2018**: No, no, you have the.
**Eawente**: What do you need?
**Eawente**: Do you want to say hi?
**Eawente**: She's been, like, sitting over here.
**Eawente**: Gems, come say hi.
**Gstrati16**: There it is.
**Esherrill2018**: That work?
**Lani.johnston1**: Yep.
**Esherrill2018**: Yeah, that's.
**Esherrill2018**: So that's the hoodie for the guys.
**Esherrill2018**: And then the girls have a navy jacket.
**Esherrill2018**: They're both Adidas.
**Esherrill2018**: And then I don't know if you'll be able to see this.
**Esherrill2018**: This is the sleeve, and it's got the Bertie Gervais logo on the sleeve.
**Ataylor**: Oh, that's cool.
**Eawente**: That's awesome.
**Ataylor**: Very cool.
**Esherrill2018**: So it's like.
**Esherrill2018**: It's not real.
**Esherrill2018**: Like, it doesn't stand out too much, but it's there.
**Eawente**: Oh, sorry.
**Eawente**: We showed me again.
**Eawente**: I was looking in the wrong spot.
**Esherrill2018**: Oh, the logo.
**Eawente**: I thought I was looking over here.
**Esherrill2018**: It's.
**Eawente**: Oh, nice.
**Eawente**: Yeah.
**Aalarson03**: Cool.
**Lani.johnston1**: Yeah, that'd be great.
**Esherrill2018**: I wore it.
**Esherrill2018**: I wore it to volleyball this past weekend and got, like, three random people come up to me and say they liked it.
**Esherrill2018**: Where'd I get it?
**Ataylor**: Very nice.
**Eawente**: Nice.
**Lani.johnston1**: Yeah, I'm a fan.
**Lani.johnston1**: Stacy Parker wore last year's pineapple shirt to the.
**Lani.johnston1**: The last outing I was in on Saturday.
**Eawente**: He did?
**Lani.johnston1**: Yeah.
**Eawente**: Love it.
**Lani.johnston1**: Yeah, it's good.

**Lani.johnston1**: No, I'm getting ready for a nine night.
**Lani.johnston1**: You should be getting ready for a nine night, huh?
**Lani.johnston1**: You look like you're all showered up and cleaned up and ready to go to bed.
**Lani.johnston1**: Gonna hang out with mom and dad for a little bit.
**Lani.johnston1**: Yeah.
**Lani.johnston1**: You get more beautiful every time I see you.
**Eawente**: Thank you.
**Aalarson03**: So cute.
**Lani.johnston1**: She's the best.
**Eawente**: What else?
**Eawente**: What other questions do you guys have?
**Eawente**: Anything that came up.
**Ataylor**: I think we're in good shape.
**Ataylor**: I mean, it'll just be getting you the next, like, smaller wave of donation items.
**Ataylor**: But if we're coming over the night before to, like, help pack bags, then we can bring it then or earlier, so.
**Ataylor**: And we can Communicate about that.
**Eawente**: Perfect for you guys that don't know we are going to do hello find again.
**Eawente**: So everything will be online.
**Eawente**: So if somebody doesn't make it and same thing.
**Eawente**: QR code link we.
**Eawente**: You can send that out to people.
**Ataylor**: Make sure you order cluster truck this week.
**Ataylor**: I know a lot of you live outside the zone.
**Ataylor**: Pickup is an option though.
**Eawente**: I think I'm gonna send it to.
**Lani.johnston1**: What is the zone for Clustertruck.
**Esherrill2018**: It's.
**Ataylor**: It runs from Fountain Square up until like I think it's like 146th street in Carmel.
**Eawente**: It's like just.
**Eawente**: Yeah.
**Eawente**: Our house is just above it.
**Lani.johnston1**: You can always afford 10 blocks north.
**Ataylor**: I was gonna say you can always order delivery and meet your driver at like a gas station right at the fringe of the zone.
**Lani.johnston1**: Dude, I love clustertruck.
**Lani.johnston1**: When I.
**Lani.johnston1**: When I worked downtown it was.
**Lani.johnston1**: It's the best.
**Lani.johnston1**: It's awesome.
**Lani.johnston1**: I love it.
**Gstrati16**: We eat it way too often.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, true.
**Lani.johnston1**: What's super convenient?
**Lani.johnston1**: Why wouldn't he.
**Lani.johnston1**: Not exactly.
**Gstrati16**: The discount is too hard to say.
**Gstrati16**: No.
**Lani.johnston1**: Yeah.
**Lani.johnston1**: And it's good food.
**Lani.johnston1**: Awesome.
**Lani.johnston1**: I love cluster truck.
**Eawente**: Awesome.
**Eawente**: What else, Todd.
**Esherrill2018**: How are we at?
**Esherrill2018**: Are we good with golf course?
**Esherrill2018**: Aaron's good with everything.
**Esherrill2018**: Do we need to just give him an update on things or check in on food and beverage?
**Eawente**: I just emailed them today.
**Lani.johnston1**: Okay.
**Eawente**: Waiting to get back.
**Eawente**: Yeah.
**Eawente**: I requested a new menu.
**Eawente**: I asked a couple things.
**Eawente**: They have somebody that wants to donate kind of like an appetizer grazing station.
**Eawente**: So ask about that.
**Eawente**: And then.
**Gstrati16**: Oh, Nicole.
**Gstrati16**: She actually said she was just going to do a gift certificate just to make things easier.
**Gstrati16**: And I said perfect.
**Eawente**: Perfect.
**Eawente**: Yeah.
**Gstrati16**: I was going to text you but then I was like, well, I'll see her at 8.
**Gstrati16**: So I'll just tell her that.
**Eawente**: Okay.
**Eawente**: Awesome.
**Eawente**: That works.
**Eawente**: Yeah.
**Eawente**: So I'll keep you posted in a loop there.
**Esherrill2018**: I'll probably again so that it's not last minute and I'm not coming in the day before.
**Esherrill2018**: I'll probably ship the signs to the course so Aaron has them and can get them out whenever he wants to in the morning.
**Esherrill2018**: I'll just bring the A frames with me.
**Esherrill2018**: So the bigger signs that need the A frames which are usually all in and around the clubhouse anyways.
**Esherrill2018**: We could just set those up as soon as I get there.
**Eawente**: Okay, perfect.
**Eawente**: Same whole assignments for like ketozzle set up.
**Eawente**: You have those from last year still?
**Esherrill2018**: Yeah, we'll go through that and I'll send Aaron the whole spreadsheet with where the signs go and who's going to be on what hole and all that good stuff.
**Aalarson03**: Okay.
**Eawente**: Perfect.
**Esherrill2018**: And then contest wise, we'll probably just do all the same contest and then.
**Esherrill2018**: Did we just get gift cards from the pro shop for prizes last year?
**Eawente**: No, I did Dick's last year.
**Esherrill2018**: Dick's.
**Esherrill2018**: Okay.
**Esherrill2018**: Yeah.
**Eawente**: Only because out of town guests, people that.
**Eawente**: I mean.
**Lani.johnston1**: Yeah.
**Esherrill2018**: No, that's great.
**Eawente**: Yeah.
**Lani.johnston1**: You guys want to.
**Lani.johnston1**: You want to see the most prestigious award you can get?
**Eawente**: You got last year last.
**Lani.johnston1**: My group got dead ass last.
**Esherrill2018**: Which outing is that one?
**Lani.johnston1**: Birdies for Babies last year.
**Esherrill2018**: I didn't know that.
**Eawente**: Yeah, I didn't either.
**Eawente**: I think you stole it from somebody.
**Esherrill2018**: Yeah, I know you.
**Esherrill2018**: No way.
**Esherrill2018**: You did.
**Lani.johnston1**: No, I'm pretty sure it was McGregor and I, and you figure out what McGregor and I were doing together and.
**Esherrill2018**: Yeah, yeah.
**Esherrill2018**: You tried to influence my playing partners at the same time.
**Lani.johnston1**: We did, actually, one of them.
**Esherrill2018**: Yeah, I know.
**Lani.johnston1**: He was done on the second hole.
**Eawente**: Before you get too far into this conversation.
**Lani.johnston1**: I know.
**Lani.johnston1**: That's what I'm saying.
**Eawente**: Virgin ears here.
**Lani.johnston1**: I know.
**Lani.johnston1**: That's what I'm saying.
**Esherrill2018**: You really were cracking them up, Steve.
**Lani.johnston1**: Well, we did well, Finished last.
**Lani.johnston1**: I got the pickleball paddle show for it.
**Eawente**: Have you used it as the question?
**Lani.johnston1**: My son took it to college.
**Lani.johnston1**: It was.
**Lani.johnston1**: He took it to college and used it.
**Lani.johnston1**: Yeah.
**Lani.johnston1**: Yeah.
**Esherrill2018**: Nicole, are you planning on trying to open auction early or just day of so that people can go online and look before the outing or just day of the outing?
**Eawente**: We can open it early.
**Esherrill2018**: It's up to you.
**Esherrill2018**: So if you do open it early, I can send a message out through the system to all the golfers and everything, which they will get one as well, with kind of a run a show agenda.
**Esherrill2018**: Just so you guys know, you know what's going on that day.
**Esherrill2018**: We'll recognize our sponsors in the.
**Esherrill2018**: In the message and all that stuff, but yeah, if we have a link to the auction that's ready to go, we can send that.
**Esherrill2018**: People can start taking a look and bidding early.
**Eawente**: Perfect.
**Eawente**: Yeah, I can do that.
**Eawente**: Yep.
**Laurenwakefield**: I was also gonna say, Nicole, I'm still waiting to hear about the Ritz.
**Laurenwakefield**: Do you still need desserts?
**Eawente**: Oh, I.
**Eawente**: I asked.
**Eawente**: Yeah, today, and I said.
**Eawente**: I already said that they would.
**Eawente**: If we get them, that it will be from them, so.
**Laurenwakefield**: Okay.
**Laurenwakefield**: Yes.
**Laurenwakefield**: I need to follow up with them again.
**Eawente**: Okay, perfect.
**Laurenwakefield**: And we can.
**Laurenwakefield**: If you want to put us, like, on the volunteer thing, we can pick those up and bring them the day off.
**Eawente**: Okay.
**Lani.johnston1**: Keep.
**Aalarson03**: Keep us his backup.
**Aalarson03**: Yeah, put us as backup.
**Gstrati16**: We can also do it too.
**Ataylor**: So if the Ritz says no, at the very worst case, I can have cluster truck donate cookies or something like that.
**Ataylor**: So.
**Laurenwakefield**: Okay.
**Eawente**: Yeah, it just has to be from like, what is it, Liz?
**Eawente**: Just a registered bakery or something.
**Laurenwakefield**: Is that what verified kitchen?
**Laurenwakefield**: Yes, I think with like the.
**Laurenwakefield**: Yeah, like, you know how you guys have like certificates or whatever to like show that.
**Laurenwakefield**: Yeah, it's like verified.
**Laurenwakefield**: It can't just be like, from your mom's kitchen.
**Eawente**: Yep.
**Ataylor**: I can confirm that.
**Ataylor**: Clustertruck is a verified kitchen.
**Eawente**: Yes.
**Lani.johnston1**: It's not a good verified kitchen.
**Lani.johnston1**: Everything I had there is great.
**Ataylor**: The cookies are just okay.
**Ataylor**: I won't lie.
**Ataylor**: But, you know, it's something.
**Lani.johnston1**: So after people have enough beverages, they don't care if it's good, bad, or indifferent.
**Laurenwakefield**: I will say though, the desserts last year were really good.
**Laurenwakefield**: Like, all of our guests loved them because they actually, like, tasted good and looked cute.
**Eawente**: I know.
**Eawente**: What are we going to do since we don't have pineapples?
**Laurenwakefield**: Yeah.
**Gstrati16**: What.
**Laurenwakefield**: What is the theme?
**Laurenwakefield**: Is there a theme?
**Eawente**: No theme.
**Laurenwakefield**: So if you had a preference.
**Laurenwakefield**: Because they will want us to say like, what we want, it makes it easier for them.
**Laurenwakefield**: Like what.
**Laurenwakefield**: What would you want on the.
**Laurenwakefield**: Or you can just text me.

**Laurenwakefield**: Golf themed.
**Ataylor**: I think that's something.
**Eawente**: Yeah, whatever.
**Laurenwakefield**: Okay.
**Eawente**: I feel like I'm good.
**Eawente**: I feel like we're in a great spot.
**Eawente**: Anybody need anything from me?
**Eawente**: Any.
**Eawente**: Any reach outs, any follow ups, any pickups, anything?
**Ataylor**: Not at the moment, no.
**Ataylor**: If you guys have any golf course, you know, contacts, trying to collect more foursome donations.
**Ataylor**: So that would be the big thing.
**Eawente**: Let's send me one from Sagamore, right?
**Eawente**: Yeah.
**Laurenwakefield**: Sagamore still has not gotten back to us.
**Eawente**: Golf Club of Indiana.
**Eawente**: Is that a personal contact or is that just a pro on there?
**Eawente**: That's a personal.
**Laurenwakefield**: Personal contact, yes.
**Laurenwakefield**: AJ's dad was on the board.
**Laurenwakefield**: Well, was on the board, I guess isn't anymore, but I was gonna ask Jeff Rubenstein again.
**Laurenwakefield**: I can reach out to him.
**Eawente**: Okay.
**Eawente**: I have chat.
**Eawente**: Well, I don't have them in hand, but more than likely I need text.
**Eawente**: Betsy.
**Eawente**: I should have chat.
**Eawente**: I'm in Holiday Farms.
**Laurenwakefield**: Awesome.
**Laurenwakefield**: And then I also have your Colts items.
**Laurenwakefield**: Guys.
**Laurenwakefield**: They're at my brother's house right now, but it's.
**Laurenwakefield**: I have three different things.
**Laurenwakefield**: So they're like.
**Laurenwakefield**: I think last year there was like a signed football sign, helmet and.
**Eawente**: Jersey.
**Laurenwakefield**: Was it a jersey?
**Laurenwakefield**: Okay.
**Laurenwakefield**: Yes.
**Laurenwakefield**: I think I Have, like, similar to last year items, but, like, I'm not all sure who the signatures are.
**Gstrati16**: Sounds good.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: Thank you very, very much.
**Laurenwakefield**: Oh, yeah.
**Ataylor**: I'm dying to know who the signatures are from.
**Ataylor**: So if you do find out, one.
**Laurenwakefield**: Of them is Jonathan Taylor.
**Laurenwakefield**: I think we have Jonathan Taylor.
**Laurenwakefield**: I think Pittman.
**Laurenwakefield**: And then the third, I.
**Laurenwakefield**: I'm not sure if it's Anthony Richardson or not, so people have really mixed reviews on him, so not sure if that'll go.
**Ataylor**: For a lot, but that one.
**Ataylor**: That one will go home with me.
**Esherrill2018**: Then.
**Ataylor**: Here.
**Eawente**: Evan's just gonna literally take every single prize there.
**Eawente**: He's.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, no, we.
**Ataylor**: We definitely.
**Ataylor**: I definitely cater to him.
**Ataylor**: Catered to my own interests, so we'll see how that goes.
**Eawente**: Todd, will you bring a shirt stand just in case it is a jersey?
**Eawente**: You told me last year you were like, I can bring a shirt jersey.
**Esherrill2018**: Yeah, I can do that.
**Eawente**: Thank you.
**Esherrill2018**: Might want to just remind me, potentially, the week before.
**Esherrill2018**: Steve, what was that.
**Esherrill2018**: What was that thing that you got donated by your buddy?
**Esherrill2018**: Like, that big, bright light or whatever?
**Lani.johnston1**: That was my brother.
**Esherrill2018**: You gonna get that again?
**Esherrill2018**: Another one?
**Lani.johnston1**: I've tried.
**Lani.johnston1**: He.
**Lani.johnston1**: He got rid of his shop, so he, like, he did a.
**Lani.johnston1**: He's.
**Lani.johnston1**: I don't know that he sold any of his business, but he sold his warehouse, so he, like, he's.
**Lani.johnston1**: He sold off all of his inventory, and so now he's simply a manufacturer's rep.
**Lani.johnston1**: He doesn't have any, like, no samples or anything.
**Lani.johnston1**: Like, the ladder, the bright light, the wheelbarrow that Nicole is like, none of this is gonna like.
**Lani.johnston1**: This is great, guys.
**Lani.johnston1**: Thank you so much.
**Lani.johnston1**: Like, why would you do that?
**Lani.johnston1**: And then it went for the most money.
**Lani.johnston1**: Like, it.
**Eawente**: And then it does.
**Eawente**: It goes for, like, thousands of dollars.
**Lani.johnston1**: Yeah, it did.
**Esherrill2018**: It did.
**Lani.johnston1**: It's all good stuff.
**Lani.johnston1**: But I'll ask him again, see if we can get anything, but I'll ask him again.
**Eawente**: Thank you.
**Lani.johnston1**: He's kind of stiffened me on rounds of golf at Bridgewater this year anyway, so he's.
**Lani.johnston1**: He.
**Lani.johnston1**: I think he owes me a favor.
**Eawente**: Cool.
**Lani.johnston1**: But I have asked.
**Lani.johnston1**: I've asked all the guys that used to give me signing jerseys.
**Lani.johnston1**: They're out.
**Lani.johnston1**: They don't have anything to donate.
**Lani.johnston1**: Yeah, I'm striking out right now.
**Lani.johnston1**: I'm striking out on golfers because it's.
**Lani.johnston1**: Whatever it is.
**Lani.johnston1**: For whatever reason, I'm striking out.
**Lani.johnston1**: It has a lot to do with.
**Lani.johnston1**: I've been super busy, and this is the first call I've been able to make.
