## Transcript
**Jremillard**: You know, moving forward, you know, from a.
**Jremillard**: From an occupancy standpoint.
**Jremillard**: So you guys, if September's the.
**Jremillard**: The occupancy is that when is the.
**Acannon**: Well, that's not the full project.
**Acannon**: That.
**Acannon**: That would be for them.
**Acannon**: Like, we're going to build it from the west to the east.
**Acannon**: And that's what I was talking about, you know, on the west side.
**Acannon**: And let me pull this drawing up.
**Acannon**: They, you know, they split all the charging stations, some on the east, some on the west.
**Acannon**: And so just find the right drawing here.
**Jdawson**: Hey, what's.
**Jdawson**: What's going on?
**Acannon**: Gentlemen, how you doing?
**Evin.sisemore**: Yeah, Jesse, this is this TJ, our director of sales.
**Jremillard**: Their VPs.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, he's our big guy.
**Acannon**: All right, Nice to meet you, tj.
**Jdawson**: I jump on late, too.
**Jdawson**: I'm project engineer for Alito.
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Acannon**: Andrew.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I was going to say we can do a quick round introductions and kind of get the meat and potatoes of it all.
**Acannon**: Yeah.
**Acannon**: So I'm with.
**Acannon**: I'm Jesse.
**Acannon**: I'm with Alito.
**Acannon**: We're the design build contractor.
**Acannon**: You know, we're trying to give them a solution to not having the power they probably need, which I haven't really even.
**Tj.shelters**: So.
**Jdawson**: So on the call, we have Matt Bowen, who is our director of sales West.
**Jdawson**: Greg's one of our senior territory managers.
**Jdawson**: Justin Knutski actually works on a critical side, so solar energy storage and backup generation is his specialty.
**Jdawson**: Evan Sizemore is our senior director of sales enablement and also an ex business owner.
**Jdawson**: Concentric has acquired a lot of independent businesses, so Evan's got a lot of experience.
**Jdawson**: And then Jason, who runs our marketing leads team, he's the one that sent us to you.
**Jdawson**: So if you've got a whole group here that we can talk through.
**Jdawson**: And I tried accessing the plan hub but was unsuccessful.
**Jdawson**: I think you're going to show us that.
**Jdawson**: And I also have a presentation that's not anything.
**Jdawson**: I'll call it firm, but it'll give you an overview, kind of guide us on that conversation a little bit.
**Acannon**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So where do you guys want to start?
**Jdawson**: Let me ask you that.
**Acannon**: I guess I'll start and just show you the project plan and then the.
**Acannon**: The reason I made the contact was to provide a hopefully a less, you know, if we don't have to run as much power over there and we can get by with the power that's available to us in the building to run all these charging stations for the material handling equipment.
**Acannon**: That's the.
**Acannon**: That's the problem I have right now.
**Jdawson**: What's what type of power are they going to use?
**Jdawson**: Is it lead, acid or lithium?
**Acannon**: Lithium is what they want to go with, but they're running into problems with the lead time on the permanent lifts being lithium.
**Acannon**: One company has led, which is a whole nightmare and I think, you know, that's one of their options.
**Acannon**: So.
**Acannon**: And then the other option is having lithium, you know, rentals to go with, to start with.
**Acannon**: So at this point, you know, I don't know exactly how that's going to be, but they'll have lithium for sure as the permanent lifts in the space.
**Jdawson**: And where is the physical location?
**Jdawson**: I think I read it.
**Jdawson**: Where's the physical.
**Jdawson**: Physical location of the building?
**Acannon**: Okay, it's at 16155 West Elwood Street.
**Acannon**: It's in Goodyear, Arizona.
**Jremillard**: And you are working on behalf of the.
**Jremillard**: That's still a dirt lot, according to what we have.
**Jremillard**: You're working on behalf of the tenant, who or not the tenant, but the, the third party group that's managing the Amazon piece.
**Tj.shelters**: Yeah.
**Acannon**: So CEVA Logistics is the company we're working for.
**Acannon**: All right, I'm almost there.
**Acannon**: See here.
**Greg.brandt**: And is Siva working for Amazon?
**Greg.brandt**: Is that.
**Acannon**: They are.
**Acannon**: I think they are leasing the space to Amazon or.
**Acannon**: I don't know how that works on logistics companies, but they're preparing this warehouse for them and then they'll be renting it.
**Acannon**: I believe Home Depot owns the warehouse.
**Jdawson**: Oh, the complexities.
**Acannon**: I know.
**Jdawson**: So as you pull that up, since you looked at the powerhive system, what, what do you want to walk through there?
**Jdawson**: So it's going to alleviate everything you just talked about.
**Jdawson**: You're.
**Jdawson**: You don't need to run the infrastructure with our system.
**Jdawson**: So it's in one area, just under 700 square feet total.
**Jdawson**: To power the whole fleet, you need three drops if we fully rack out, which is three cabinets.
**Jdawson**: But they're all in one area.
**Jdawson**: So that's one major benefit and why people deploy is it's construction savings and then it's not a lot of space savings as well.
**Jdawson**: And then you don't have the peak power consumption with lithium.
**Jdawson**: So you know, you're going to have these forklifts spread out in the facility.
**Jdawson**: As you're showing, they're expected to charge on brakes that's going to consume a lot of, a lot of electricity all at one time.
**Jdawson**: And I don't know what the infrastructure of the building is.
**Jdawson**: That's something we'd have to figure out with you if it's capable of doing that.
**Jdawson**: You know, do you need A transformer upgrade, breaker, upgrades.
**Jdawson**: Those would be the questions we'd ask.
**Acannon**: Yeah, so you know, our electricians, we have multiple ones looking at it right now.
**Acannon**: You know, if I understand you correct, they would break, provide the electrical panels and the circuits and then they just feed.
**Acannon**: Do they just feed your piece of equipment that then feeds all the chargers or how does that work?
**Jdawson**: Correct.
**Jdawson**: They would put the drops down and we would tie in.
**Tj.shelters**: Okay.
**Acannon**: I'm gonna.
**Acannon**: This is the plan.
**Acannon**: Hub, I was talking.
**Greg.brandt**: Do you know how many lifts are at this facility?
**Acannon**: Yeah, I'll open that up here in second here.
**Justin.kutniewski**: Evan, they had I think 69 chargers on one side and like 56 on the other side of the building.
**Justin.kutniewski**: And I think, I think we're maybe making the assumption they're roughly one to one.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, well there'll be a lot of, a lot of details we'll have to work through that aren't that cumbersome.
**Jdawson**: So I don't want to sound like it has to be a long process, but the size of the battery, voltage of the battery, you know, voltages by truck.
**Jdawson**: So that's what I'm going to work through.
**Acannon**: This here is one of the plans that's in there.
**Acannon**: I just did a blow up of it.
**Acannon**: So they got 83 order pickers or 25amp.
**Acannon**: It's got 15 or 10 tuggers, they're only 15amp.
**Acannon**: 14 reaches 25amps, 13 swing reach 35amps.
**Acannon**: Three of the rider jacks, 15amp and three stand up forklifts.
**Acannon**: 25amps.
**Acannon**: So that totals one hundred and twenty six.
**Evin.sisemore**: Yeah, a few thousand amps alone on the order pickers prior.
**Acannon**: So that's, you know.
**Acannon**: And this is on the east side of the building, this is on the west and the west is the one we'd want to do first.
**Tj.shelters**: Okay.
**Acannon**: So you're saying like if you fed them all individually it's 2000amps.
**Evin.sisemore**: But yeah, just on the order pickers alone, 2000amps are required to run those chargers.
**Jdawson**: But with your system based on this.
**Acannon**: Yeah, but we'll have in your system then we only need how many amps?
**Evin.sisemore**: It's 250amp drop for each rack.
**Jdawson**: So three drives.
**Jdawson**: So three.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, three of those would be three 250amp drops total to run all those lifts, the swing reaches we'll have to work through.
**Jdawson**: Typically those are wire guided and dedicated to an area.
**Jdawson**: So those potentially may stay one for one depending.
**Jdawson**: We do have a customer that deployed the system with swing reach trucks.
**Jdawson**: We told them the same thing.
**Jdawson**: Hey, look, typically the customers just leave those one for one because they're bigger and hard to drive.
**Jdawson**: They don't want them to leave an area.
**Jdawson**: Customers still wanted to do it and they've been very successful doing it.
**Jdawson**: So it's very possible.
**Jdawson**: But I'll share over you if you don't mind.
**Acannon**: Sure.
**Jdawson**: And so we were.
**Jdawson**: Well, we always ask upfront what's important to you really?
**Jdawson**: You have a constraint issue and I think we've kind of identified that is you have a space issue and you have an electrification issue.
**Speaker 7**: Right.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: And you know, I'm not just going to show the PowerPoint and go slide by slide.
**Jdawson**: I want to be more of a conversation.
**Jdawson**: I do want to come back to the benefits of the system, including energy consumption, which I'm sure we'll talk through.
**Jdawson**: These are actual data points from customers that have deployed the system so that it's real.
**Jdawson**: But I wanted to show you an overview of the system and kind of what it looks like.
**Jdawson**: So we call these the cabinets.
**Jdawson**: So this is a different design.
**Jdawson**: We call it our narrow design.
**Jdawson**: So you can have a horseshoe type design as shown here.
**Jdawson**: Max capacity of the system technically is three cabinets because the arm can only move so fast to access three.
**Jdawson**: We have a customer that deployed a fourth cabinet because they wanted less cycle throughput on the power.
**Jdawson**: They wanted to potentially last a little longer.
**Jdawson**: But you just, you know, throughput.
**Jdawson**: The system can't get to all cabinets if you change the battery every two and a half, three minutes.
**Jdawson**: So the overall concept of the system is it's the first system that's ever deployed power to the customer at their fingertips when they need it.
**Jdawson**: And then without the electrical infrastructure and or the peak demand that lithium asks for today.
**Jdawson**: So it is a lithium based system.
**Jdawson**: And what we've done is we've separated the power from that counterweight.
**Jdawson**: So if you think about it, you know, when we started developing the system and you think electrification of cars, people don't want to go to an electric car because they worry about having to stop and plug in on a long road trip.
**Jdawson**: Well, if you stopped at the gas station, went and got your Slurpee, and by the time you walk back, the battery dropped out of the car and a fully new battery was put back in the car in the same amount of time it took you to fill your gas tank up, I think people would love it.
**Jdawson**: That's inherently what the system does.
**Speaker 7**: Right.
**Jdawson**: The operator pulls up into the operator alley and I can show you a video of it.
**Jdawson**: They push a button on the side, the arm engages with the truck, pulls the battery out, puts it in a charging station, grabs a refresh battery, puts it in the truck.
**Jdawson**: Our average reload time across all systems I think is like 2 minutes and 20 seconds.
**Jdawson**: So we call it a three minute reload by the time an operator gets off the truck and gets back on.
**Jdawson**: The other major benefit is when you deploy a one for one system.
**Jdawson**: We talked about the energy demand, but if a battery goes down, that means the truck's out of service.
**Jdawson**: If a charger's down, that means that truck's out of service.
**Jdawson**: So customers still oversize their fleets because they don't want down equipment.
**Jdawson**: You don't have that with the system.
**Jdawson**: If the charger's down or a battery's down that nobody knows we do, we get notified, we got to come fix it.
**Jdawson**: But when the operator pushes that button, they get a battery.
**Jdawson**: Another major event.
**Jdawson**: Go ahead.
**Acannon**: Does this work with any kind of lift or is it a specific brand or type of.
**Jdawson**: That's probably one of the biggest benefits is that it fits all lifts and it also provides flexibility.
**Jdawson**: So if you have beige trucks or red trucks, they all have a battery box.
**Jdawson**: And if you deploy a lead acid battery or one for one lithium, that battery box has a size, then you put the lithium in it.
**Jdawson**: And that lithium battery fits that type of battery compartment.
**Jdawson**: If you want to switch trucks or switch your fleet or change, you got to buy a new battery at the end of the day.
**Jdawson**: And now the lithium batteries are supposed to and do outlast the forklift chassis.
**Jdawson**: So now the chassis life cycle is going to be over.
**Jdawson**: When they go to refresh that chassis, they have to buy the same chassis size because the battery they bought fits it.
**Jdawson**: With this system you don't have to do that.
**Jdawson**: The cradle, what we call the cradle here, the cradle is configurable.
**Jdawson**: So if you have a 36 volt fleet.
**Jdawson**: So I don't know if the the order pickers are 36 or 24 volt.
**Jdawson**: With the amount that they have, my guess is they're going to be 36 volt, probably higher throughput.
**Jdawson**: So you have 36 volt stock pickers and if you have 36 volt reach trucks and 36 volt stand ups, the 36 volt battery in the system fits in all three.
**Jdawson**: We just changed the configuration of that cradle.
**Jdawson**: And if they ever wanted to reconfigure their trucks or scale up, it's no problem.
**Speaker 7**: Right.
**Jdawson**: The voltage of the battery is there for them to pick from.
**Jdawson**: You know, tuggers may be 24 volt and let's just say the order pickers are 24 volt.
**Jdawson**: That 24 volt battery will go with both the tuggers and the order pickers.
**Acannon**: Interesting.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, it's a lot to digest in a short amount of time.
**Jdawson**: So that's why I wanted to be very exploratory and again I'm happy to show you the video at any time if you want to watch it.
**Acannon**: So you're saying that they may be over figured on the amount of lifts they actually need because of the charging.
**Jdawson**: Very good.
**Jdawson**: Typically, you know we have an industry insights.
**Jdawson**: I hit it here.
**Jdawson**: But 76% of fleets are oversized and that is an industry study.
**Jdawson**: That is a, that is a factual thing that we've we encountered every day.
**Jdawson**: One, but two, it's, you know, posted by all the major magazines There's a, there's a ton of other benefits to the system.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: From a safety perspective you don't have operators touching anything anymore.
**Jdawson**: People love that.
**Jdawson**: Operators love it.
**Jdawson**: And then the biggest benefit we see financially is productivity to the customer.
**Jdawson**: We get that question a ton.
**Jdawson**: We're going to opportunity charge operators take breaks anyways.
**Jdawson**: How am I gaining productivity by using the system?
**Jdawson**: There is still downtime when it comes to power.
**Jdawson**: Whether the battery's out of service, chargers out of service and or the operator compliance piece they're supposed to plug it in.
**Jdawson**: They don't always.
**Jdawson**: I've seen operators plug chargers into trucks.
**Jdawson**: They have to walk to and from break rooms.
**Acannon**: Right.
**Jdawson**: That 15 minute break isn't firm.
**Jdawson**: There's hours wasted outside of that per operator.
**Jdawson**: And we do all those studies with our customers.
**Jdawson**: Every customer we've deployed and has seen at minimum 5% more throughput in their facility which hits their P and L right.
**Jdawson**: Some see more.
**Jdawson**: And that is what this chart on the right is.
**Jdawson**: It is on the left side of the chart and I'm going to use this piece here where they overlap.
**Jdawson**: That's the day we installed the Power Hive.
**Jdawson**: So the orange is the percent of time or hours spent in the battery changing area because they track it.
**Jdawson**: So this is what their productivity look like.
**Jdawson**: The green line is time spent doing work.
**Jdawson**: The day we installed the Power Hive you can see time spent in the battery room changing batteries because they did change lead acid batteries significantly dropped and then their productivity spiked and then it's kind of flattened with an initial, you know, it's got a small curve.
**Jdawson**: You're going to get so much more throughput.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: But their operators are Spending more time doing work than they ever have in the past.
**Jdawson**: The other side of this facility actually has one for one lithium and they want to replace it because of all the issues that they're having with one for one lithium that we just walked through.
**Jdawson**: And then this is the electrical consumption and savings.
**Jdawson**: So I don't know the rules in Arizona.
**Jdawson**: This is a lead acid versus lithium comparison.
**Jdawson**: So you can see they reduced and they metered it.
**Jdawson**: So physical meter on their, their charging area, they reduce their consumption 65% and they see the cost savings of 27,000.
**Jdawson**: This is a Pennsylvania based customer.
**Jdawson**: They actually pay for peak demand.
**Jdawson**: So that's 27,000 on the base rate.
**Jdawson**: But they actually pay peak on the other side for lithium.
**Jdawson**: I don't know if Arizona has that or not, but we have deployed lithium in customers in a one for one setting.
**Jdawson**: They reduce electrical consumption around 30% the number.
**Jdawson**: But they end up paying more for the power because they're paying on the peak demand.
**Jdawson**: And you eliminate with that system, we don't recharge the battery over a three to four hour period.
**Jdawson**: We don't have to charge it in a 15 minute window.
**Greg.brandt**: And I'll say I've been in the industry, I don't know, probably 15 years.
**Greg.brandt**: And for the last 15 years our goal has been trying to get customers to a one to one scenario.
**Greg.brandt**: And what we've really been finding out in the last five years is every time our customer goes to plug into charge or an operator forgets to charge, that equals downtime and it's no productivity for the customer.
**Greg.brandt**: So that's really one of the biggest problems that we were trying to solve with the Hive.
**Greg.brandt**: And I inserted a snippet into the chat that y' all can look at.
**Greg.brandt**: But the Hive has all real time data where we can go on and see how often your swap the customer swapping, how hard they're running if they're prematurely swapping.
**Greg.brandt**: A lot of customers who swap batteries, they're used to swapping before their shift comes so they don't have to do it during.
**Greg.brandt**: So we can regulate all of that.
**Greg.brandt**: But we had a customer that they had 12 rental batteries or rental, rental trucks and batteries because they really, they ended up having it because they always had downtime because of battery issues, maintenance issues.
**Greg.brandt**: So whenever we did our first 90 day review with the customer after getting the Hive in there, we showed them this report and they had 12 trucks that were used less than four hours a day and they had an additional eight trucks that were used less than two hours a day.
**Greg.brandt**: And the first thing the customer said was crap.
**Greg.brandt**: We need to turn all these rentals in because the data doesn't lie.
**Greg.brandt**: And you know, they're not even using those trucks.
**Greg.brandt**: So they had trucks that they were swapping a battery every two weeks.
**Greg.brandt**: So it's really cool seeing that and just being able to take the customer out of, you know, having to charge batteries and make sure their power is up altogether.
**Acannon**: Do you have like all of this stuff you're going to send me or email me?
**Jdawson**: I can, absolutely.
**Jdawson**: And that's the question.
**Jdawson**: Look, this is a pretty unique situation that we've got here, which is fun.
**Jdawson**: We've got a tight window, right?
**Jdawson**: You've got some constraints in the building.
**Jdawson**: You've got to figure it out fast.
**Jdawson**: We can, we can, we can hit deadlines.
**Jdawson**: We have to move extremely fast.
**Acannon**: And the good cost of this thing.
**Jdawson**: So the, the cost of the system is going to be, I would say, depending on the electrical infrastructure cost.
**Jdawson**: If you haven't run drops.
**Jdawson**: So when we see a customer go from battery changing to lithium, they have to run all those drops.
**Jdawson**: Like you're talking about our system, one to one is cheaper because we don't have that infrastructure cost and the lithium is still a lithium battery.
**Jdawson**: So the cost comparison is very similar, if not more beneficial.
**Jdawson**: If you talk just batteries and chargers, right?
**Jdawson**: Because yes, we have the arm and cabinets, but we don't have to run the infrastructure.
**Acannon**: That's what makes us more cost with your system.
**Acannon**: They wouldn't have to buy any battery chargers, any batteries or the batteries that come when they purchase their lip, they're going to get the battery and then you just charge it.
**Jdawson**: No, they, they would buy.
**Jdawson**: So our battery fits in our system.
**Jdawson**: We can't take their battery because we've separated that.
**Jdawson**: So when I say so, if you, if you buy, if you get a quote from a one for one lithium provider, any of them, right.
**Jdawson**: And you have to.
**Jdawson**: The cost of the infrastructure for the drawing that you just showed us and then I quoted you with our system, which includes everything, the batteries, the cradles, the robot arm, the cabinets and the infrastructure, we're going to show savings to the customer just on that.
**Jdawson**: The real savings in truth is the other things we just went through, the true savings on electricity, the fact that they absolutely will move more product and then we can talk through the space savings.
**Speaker 7**: Right.
**Jdawson**: I know they're going to park the truck somewhere, but you're still a five by eight area because you've got to put a stand and A pogo and the truck's got to come park.
**Jdawson**: You don't have to do that anymore.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: So they can technically those two charging areas, they can rack out, they can floor stack.
**Jdawson**: And if they utilize that space, now you're talking inventory.
**Jdawson**: What's the cost of a pallet?
**Jdawson**: How many turns?
**Jdawson**: Some people utilize that, some don't, but that's, that's a real savings to a customer.
**Speaker 7**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Warehouse space is expensive.
**Jremillard**: Just real quick Andrew, from your perspective, you can actually redesign the floor plan.
**Jremillard**: You can optimize by putting this anywhere you'd like to put it.
**Jremillard**: So if you look at the workflow of your forklifts, it doesn't have to be on one end or the other.
**Jremillard**: It could be centralized, it could be close to the break room, it could be anywhere that the flow of traffic is more prevalent.
**Acannon**: Yeah, because they have three.
**Acannon**: You're saying they would need three of them is what you're thinking by looking at this amount of.
**Acannon**: If they even need this many.
**Jdawson**: So they, it would be one arm, just one arm.
**Jdawson**: So one spot.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Three cabinets, one spot.
**Jdawson**: Now what we do is to ensure, but based upon the information you gave me, I'm highly confident it's one arm.
**Jdawson**: And that's again the benefit of the system.
**Jdawson**: We would ask you know, the end user the question about throughput, unless it was extremely high throughput and order pickers again that typically reach trucks, you can get some kilowatts consumed in a shift.
**Jdawson**: Order pickers because of the way they operate.
**Jdawson**: They don't consume as much kilowatt hours as a full blown reach truck going 400 plus inches.
**Jdawson**: So this system easily will do.
**Jdawson**: One arm will do this system.
**Jdawson**: We've got 180 trucks on one arm and one of our customers, but they have a big 24 volt class 3 fleet that they use it on.
**Jdawson**: And 24 volt product doesn't consume as many amps as again as a reach truck.
**Jdawson**: So they can cycle a lot of trucks on a certain amount of batteries in the system.
**Jdawson**: So one arm would suit the bill most likely.
**Jdawson**: But how do you want it?
**Jdawson**: So there, there's a lot to digest here.
**Acannon**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And I don't want to, yeah, I don't want to sound salesy but everything you're going through this system hits.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, it's in the field, it works.
**Jdawson**: You've got siva and an end user involved.
**Jdawson**: How do you want to navigate that and who, who in, in the decision making process.
**Jdawson**: If you say yes, who's going to do it?
**Speaker 7**: Right.
**Acannon**: Yeah.
**Acannon**: I need to, if you can send me this info, I'll set up a meeting with, you know the, the rep I was talking with on site because she was talking about the different options for their, the lifts.
**Acannon**: They haven't decided which one they're using yet.
**Acannon**: I don't think that was a week ago, you know, because they were weighing the cost of that.
**Acannon**: But this makes a, this will make a big difference if it, if it saves us having to rough in all that electrical need all that electrical plus before they order all their lifts, then in their material, hand and equipment, we get that coordinated.
**Acannon**: So in this, like these batteries, your batteries, like how are they?
**Acannon**: Are they spec?
**Acannon**: You said they weren't specific to any type of equipment.
**Acannon**: But like whatever they bought or brought in, if it was a lithium, if it was a lithium lift, you could put your battery in it.
**Jdawson**: Correct.
**Acannon**: It works no matter what it is for any lithium lift.
**Jdawson**: Correct.
**Jdawson**: We are, we are in all the major brands today deployed.
**Greg.brandt**: Okay, well, let me have to be a lithium.
**Greg.brandt**: It could be a lead acid that we can burn over to lithium as well.
**Jdawson**: Pretty much.
**Acannon**: It could be a lead acid lift and you can put a lithium battery in it.
**Acannon**: Really.
**Greg.brandt**: Majority of our customers that we install that already have their forklifts there.
**Greg.brandt**: They are lead acid, but then newer they can order, you know, the lithium package.
**Acannon**: Okay, so you're saying certain ones they can convert to lithium, but some they can't.
**Jdawson**: Well, the, the lit.
**Jdawson**: So the truth about a lift truck is it's seeking voltage, right.
**Jdawson**: In amperage.
**Jdawson**: So if it reads, if it reads it from the battery and it can draw it, it's gonna, it's gonna run.
**Jdawson**: So that's what the, the lithium quote, unquote, lithium lift versus lead acid lift.
**Jdawson**: It's about conforming into their, the BDI of the forklift, right.
**Jdawson**: It's, it's a discharge indicator.
**Jdawson**: We have an external discharge indicator, right.
**Jdawson**: That runs and then the battery itself from a battery management system, we actually control the forklift.
**Speaker 7**: Right.
**Jdawson**: So if the battery gets to a certain level and the operator's not complying when the, when the lift, when the battery sees low voltage from the lift, it'll actually stop the lift.
**Jdawson**: So it's not going to stop the lift when it's driving full speed or razoring or lowering a pallet.
**Jdawson**: But when it comes to a low state of voltage, it will stop.
**Jdawson**: The lift operator can re key it and we can set those parameters to anything we want.
**Jdawson**: But at the end of the day, if you got down to 12% state of charge.
**Jdawson**: You better go back.
**Jdawson**: Because we keep the battery between 10 and 90%.
**Jdawson**: We don't charge it to 100.
**Speaker 7**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Because if you really.
**Jdawson**: I know it's lithium and everybody loves it, it's still a battery.
**Jdawson**: And if you've got an iPhone and you download the latest software, you can control how your iPhone charges.
**Jdawson**: They recommend that you don't charge your iPhone to 100%.
**Jdawson**: They want you to charge it to 90 because it extends the life of your battery.
**Jdawson**: Energy flows really freely in a lithium battery till it gets to 90%.
**Jdawson**: Then that space is jammed up and it takes a lot more to shove that energy in.
**Speaker 7**: Right.
**Jdawson**: And then if you go too flow below, too far below a state of charge, it can also hurt the health.
**Jdawson**: So we're keeping the battery in that sweet spot for longevity.
**Acannon**: Okay.
**Acannon**: All right, well, let me get to work on this.
**Acannon**: I think I understand enough.
**Acannon**: And for.
**Acannon**: To power up, you're saying we only need one of these, and that only needs, like, how much?
**Acannon**: How much?
**Acannon**: Like what size?
**Evin.sisemore**: It's one 250amp drop per rack.
**Evin.sisemore**: So seven on your system?
**Tj.shelters**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Maybe three, four racks.
**Jremillard**: Hey, Jesse, let me ask about.
**Jdawson**: Is.
**Jremillard**: Is the decision maker, is it Amazon.
**Acannon**: Or is it Seba Siva?
**Jremillard**: It would be Siba who actually buys it.
**Jremillard**: Yes, because I, I just, I know from experience, Amazon, if, if new technologies are being put into an Amazon operation, there's a whole slew of things we need to expect from Amazon engineering, things like that, because they don't just deploy new technology without testing it first.
**Jremillard**: So I don't know if you need to dig deeper into that or if we can just rely on just the Ceba connection.
**Acannon**: Well, I'll explain that to her.
**Acannon**: And I mean, they're the ones that will be buying the battery system.
**Acannon**: I'll have to get you in touch with her as well.
**Jremillard**: So is there an Amazon site manager at this location during construction by chance.
**Acannon**: That I don't know.
**Acannon**: We're not dealing with Amazon.
**Jdawson**: We'll let.
**Tj.shelters**: Jesse, let you.
**Jdawson**: We'll let you navigate that.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: I mean, at the end of the day, you've got to go have a conversation and you'll.
**Jdawson**: You'll guide us there as to what it is.
**Jdawson**: So you're.
**Jdawson**: I think what you're asking is we will, once if they're interested, which we really hope they are, we'll get the.
**Jdawson**: We'll get more specifics on the forklifts and their assumed usage.
**Jdawson**: We'll then be able to answer the approximate amount of battery.
**Jdawson**: So obviously you have to have a battery in every truck.
**Jdawson**: So the 83 plus the 10, plus the 14, I think there's a few more in there.
**Jdawson**: So all those trucks will have a battery in it right?
**Jdawson**: In the system, based upon throughput, we typically see about, per truck, 1.15 batteries.
**Jdawson**: Because when people talk about battery changing, they think of lead, which is two batteries to one truck or three batteries to one truck.
**Jdawson**: You know, we're no more than 1.2 batteries per truck.
**Jdawson**: These three cabinets house 34 spares total.
**Jdawson**: And again, we're running 180 trucks on those 34.
**Jdawson**: And we have multiple voltages inside of the racks.
**Jdawson**: So when you pull in the arm scans the code and there's some cameras.
**Jdawson**: So on the cradle there's actually a.
**Jdawson**: It's not a qr, it's a DM code they call it.
**Jdawson**: So when the operator pulls in, the cameras pick up that DM code, it identifies what battery it needs by voltage.
**Jdawson**: So they just pull in.
**Jdawson**: If it's 24, it knows it.
**Jdawson**: If it's 36, it knows it.
**Jdawson**: And then on.
**Jdawson**: The operators and owners always want to know the performance of the truck.
**Jdawson**: So when that battery goes into the cradle, we're downloading the information and it gives us to it by how that truck performed.
**Jdawson**: Right?
**Jdawson**: So it could have three batteries in it in a day.
**Jdawson**: But that cradle is what we report out onto so we can actually tell the customer how the truck operated, how many amps was consumed by that truck.
**Jdawson**: And we put truck numbers and names and people want to know in certain areas, are my people doing the right amount of work?
**Jdawson**: The system tells you all that.
**Jdawson**: We have a whole data package on the back end that comes with the system, so the customer gets a dashboard and can see all of that.
**Jdawson**: So again, there's a lot to go through.
**Jdawson**: It's pretty cool.
**Jdawson**: If you cut us a PO today, which I know you can't, September timeline.
**Jdawson**: It's about where we're at from a lead time perspective.
**Jdawson**: Three to six months depending.
**Jdawson**: But we install in a new facility, we'll have you up run earning in about three days deployed.
**Jdawson**: So it's not a.
**Jdawson**: An overwhelmingly tough thing to do.
**Acannon**: And cost like what is just a ballpark.
**Acannon**: Obviously it's.
**Jdawson**: You're going to be between a million, 2, probably.
**Acannon**: 0.2 million, no 1 and 2 million.
**Greg.brandt**: Gotta look at more than just the initial cost because the productivity that you'll get back, I mean, you're going to see an astronomical savings.
**Acannon**: But that 1.2 million includes your equipment and all the batteries.
**Tj.shelters**: Yeah.
**Evin.sisemore**: Plus the guarantee guaranteed for seven years, seven year warranty.
**Greg.brandt**: If a battery goes down, if a charger goes down, everything is included in that.
**Greg.brandt**: We just fix it or replace it.
**Greg.brandt**: It comes with around the clock service which I, I know from working at other SIVA locations that's one of their biggest issues when batteries go down as their truck is completely down for.
**Acannon**: Yeah, yeah.
**Evin.sisemore**: That's one thing we didn't.
**Evin.sisemore**: Yeah, sorry Jesse.
**Evin.sisemore**: One thing we didn't hit on was the guaranteed.
**Evin.sisemore**: It's a, it's an encompass of our guaranteed power program.
**Evin.sisemore**: So that's full maintenance, all inclusive.
**Greg.brandt**: For eight years.
**Acannon**: And you said that it'll always have like two batteries for every lift.
**Acannon**: So there's always at least one.
**Jdawson**: Well, there's a spare battery for every lift.
**Jdawson**: There's not two.
**Jdawson**: That's right.
**Jdawson**: And if you look at, I mean let them lithium batteries can run you 20, 20 grand.
**Jdawson**: 30ish grand, 25 depending on the size.
**Jdawson**: You've got over 100 batteries.
**Jdawson**: They're, they're too many on a project.
**Jdawson**: I mean that's, that's kind of the way you got to look at it.
**Jdawson**: And we're going to be in that exact same ballpark.
**Jdawson**: And the point I make to all the customers that ask that I know it's new, it's fanc, got a robot arm.
**Jdawson**: You're not going to pay 2x more, you're not going to pay 50% more than the system that you're going to deploy.
**Jdawson**: In the situation that, that these folks are in because of the infrastructure, they'll actually be able to save some money.
**Acannon**: But what happens on that robot arm doesn't work.
**Jdawson**: Great question.
**Jdawson**: So we have a little walkie stacker that can manually go into the racks and get batteries.
**Jdawson**: I'm knocking on wood here.
**Jdawson**: We're 99.9% uptime for the systems that have been deployed, which we have quite a few deployed.
**Jdawson**: We're deploying about one to two a month every month.
**Jdawson**: And we've had very little disruption with the arm.
**Jdawson**: The issues we've had aren't necessarily robot arm related.
**Jdawson**: I'll call it more software and or environmental disruption.
**Jdawson**: So as an example, if you've got an older truck and facility, we did they park but that parking brake doesn't engage correctly.
**Jdawson**: When we remove the battery, the truck will inch forward, right.
**Jdawson**: Quarter inch, half inch.
**Jdawson**: So when it goes to put the battery back in that truck, it bogs it up.
**Jdawson**: There's a teach pendant with the system and so we educate the customer on how to use that teach bend in these situations.
**Jdawson**: They can quick.
**Jdawson**: It's like a gaming controller.
**Jdawson**: They quickly move.
**Jdawson**: They can put the battery back in the truck.
**Jdawson**: Once they move the arm back into the cell, they can go do a reset and it gets to running.
**Speaker 7**: Right.
**Jdawson**: So we educate the customers.
**Jdawson**: That's like some of the small things that we see from a software perspective, but we don't see that very often, which is amazing.
**Acannon**: And how long has this system been in operation?
**Acannon**: Like have you had these being in use?
**Jdawson**: Gosh, I guess we're going on five years now.
**Jdawson**: So we tested the system for two pre launch.
**Jdawson**: So we designed the system, engineered it and physically deployed it inside of customers in all environments, including cold storage and freezer applications.
**Jdawson**: Because when we launched the product, everybody, you go to promoter or Modex and there's new technology.
**Jdawson**: People want to go buy it, but you can't just get it.
**Jdawson**: There's always a catch.
**Jdawson**: And that's not who we wanted to be.
**Jdawson**: So we vetted that system out fully for two years and now we.
**Jdawson**: Gosh, almost two and a half years since we've launched.
**Jdawson**: I think We've got over 15, 16 systems in today.
**Jdawson**: Maybe more than that now.
**Jdawson**: I lost track.
**Jdawson**: I used to have a counter in my head, but we've got a reload counter on our website.
**Jdawson**: But yeah, it's been out for a lot of years.
**Greg.brandt**: Okay, over 150,000 swapped.
**Jdawson**: Probably like 175,000 now.
**Jdawson**: So just it goes fast.
**Jdawson**: The counter is going fast today.
**Acannon**: 175, 000 what reloads physical batteries.
**Acannon**: And you said there's a manual thing that they can use if that robot arm goes out to get the batteries off and in.
**Jdawson**: Correct.
**Jdawson**: And we, we've been through because you listen, Steve is going to have all these questions.
**Jdawson**: We're not scared to talk through the system.
**Jdawson**: We're not scared to have them talk to our existing customer base.
**Jdawson**: I'm hoping one day that goes away.
**Jdawson**: But everybody wants to go see it.
**Jdawson**: We don't let people into our other customers unless they're very serious about buying.
**Jdawson**: But our customers will let them in.
**Jdawson**: They'll take the phone calls.
**Jdawson**: We had a customer come to promat sit and did a talk.
**Jdawson**: I can send you all that.
**Jdawson**: The videos of us talking through it.
**Jdawson**: They've done all kinds of marketing and promotion material that we've got for that too.
**Jdawson**: So I can tell you the system works.
**Jdawson**: It's the best power system that the customer could deploy.
**Jdawson**: They don't know it yet.
**Acannon**: This is what hold On a second.
**Acannon**: Okay.
**Acannon**: Yeah.
**Acannon**: I mean, it looks like a pretty, pretty awesome system.
**Acannon**: So.
**Acannon**: And when you have like, what if, like, could we still put in three or four charging stations and are there lifts still able to plug in if they want to, or it has to be charged by this thing.
**Jdawson**: So I'm going to say yes with an asterisk.
**Jdawson**: So we actually have a scenario today that we are opportunity charging.
**Jdawson**: They're gonna.
**Jdawson**: The Hives installed, they're gonna go to use the Hive.
**Jdawson**: In the interim, we had to do some opportunity charging.
**Jdawson**: So they've engineered that.
**Jdawson**: I've got to double check if.
**Jdawson**: If that's going to be fully deployable on every system or if that's a special because the cradle today only sends energy one one way from the battery to the truck.
**Jdawson**: Now, obviously in this scenario, we got the cradle to take energy back into the battery, so we are able to do that.
**Jdawson**: I just got to confirm if we're going to do that with every deployable system.
**Jdawson**: But if they wanted to do that, we could absolutely do that.
**Jdawson**: And then the swing reaches will have to be discussed.
**Speaker 7**: Right.
**Jdawson**: What is the voltage?
**Jdawson**: We don't have an 80 volt option.
**Jdawson**: So if they're 80 volt swing reaches, they're going to have to go one for one on the 80 volts and we have lithium options for that.
**Jdawson**: If they're 48.
**Jdawson**: We can do it in the high, but we would really want to talk with Siva through that just to understand and make sure.
**Jdawson**: I'm sure they're going to want to talk to us anyhow.
**Jdawson**: But again, if, when they have all these questions, you can tell them that we're very confident we've got a customer base, they can talk to them.
**Jdawson**: Hell, they can fly somewhere and we can show the system if we want.
**Jdawson**: So I could deploy a demo there if they wanted me to.
**Jdawson**: We have a demo that's currently deployed.
**Jdawson**: We're going to pick it up soon.
**Jdawson**: But we come into a customer facility, we'll drop that demo.
**Jdawson**: They have it installed in two days and they can run it.
**Acannon**: Interesting.
**Acannon**: All right, and one last time, and I've asked this a couple times, to power your system.
**Acannon**: That would feed these units would take about 750amps.
**Acannon**: Correct?
**Tj.shelters**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Maximum.
**Greg.brandt**: We might need a fifth, a fourth one, which would be a net digital 250, most likely three.
**Acannon**: So 1,000amp max, worst case.
**Tj.shelters**: Correct.
**Tj.shelters**: Okay.
**Acannon**: And.
**Evin.sisemore**: 600 square feet.
**Evin.sisemore**: Six hundred and twenty square foot area.
**Acannon**: And you're estimating these.
**Acannon**: These would take over 2000 if we conventionally Just fed individual chargers.
**Evin.sisemore**: That's what appears just the order pickers alone, you know, based off 25amp.
**Evin.sisemore**: 25amp breaker for each.
**Evin.sisemore**: For each order picker.
**Tj.shelters**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: That's just the breaker size.
**Jdawson**: It's not consumption.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Acannon**: I think they're like 21 or 2amps.
**Jdawson**: Jesse, in the, in the, in the.
**Justin.kutniewski**: Numbers you shared in the initial outreach, if I added that up, you would need around 4,000amps.
**Acannon**: Yeah.
**Justin.kutniewski**: So this would be a.
**Justin.kutniewski**: Consider considerably less on two sides of the building.
**Greg.brandt**: Going to be even more.
**Acannon**: The lithium takes.
**Greg.brandt**: The customer goes.
**Greg.brandt**: Yeah, if the customer goes lithium, which I thought you said they were looking at, it would be even more.
**Jdawson**: Show them the char.
**Tj.shelters**: Okay.
**Acannon**: Yeah.
**Acannon**: If you look at their drawings like, you know, they just said provide us 126 to 35amp spots.
**Acannon**: Even though they don't need, you know, it's oversized, but I think when they send out their.
**Acannon**: Their rfp, it was, you know, maybe worst case for everything.
**Jdawson**: That would make it even worse.
**Jdawson**: It again, it depends on the kilowatt hour capacity of the battery.
**Jdawson**: The 2025 scares me.
**Jdawson**: Lead acid, it wouldn't.
**Jdawson**: But you got a 40% or more start rate on the lithium.
**Jdawson**: And that's where it gets tricky.
**Jdawson**: With lithium, one for one because I can sell you a smaller battery that's cheaper and I can charge it faster, but now I need more energy on demand, which is a bigger breaker.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Or I can sell you a bigger battery with lesser charge.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: I have to pump so much energy in with lesser breaker.
**Jdawson**: But now we're more expensive so that there's.
**Jdawson**: As we get into one for one deals, we've got to walk through all of that.
**Jdawson**: So if you got a thousand ampere hour battery, a typical fast charge rate is 40%.
**Jdawson**: Well, in lithium you're gonna.
**Jdawson**: You may go more than that.
**Jdawson**: Some people charge it a full 1C, which is supposed to be a thousand amps or so.
**Jdawson**: That's.
**Jdawson**: That's a big breaker on each one of those.
**Jdawson**: So when we got.
**Jdawson**: I'm not the electrical engineer on staff.
**Jdawson**: His name's Antonio.
**Jdawson**: We have a few others.
**Jdawson**: So when those electricity conversation comes up, we'll have those folks on the call and they.
**Jdawson**: Y' all can talk electrical.
**Evin.sisemore**: I.
**Evin.sisemore**: I apologize, I may have missed it, but is there a reason why this.
**Speaker 7**: The.
**Evin.sisemore**: The two charging stations will be set on both two sides of the buildings.
**Acannon**: Is it honestly probably maybe space or space.
**Acannon**: Space and electrical, I would imagine.
**Speaker 7**: Availability.
**Evin.sisemore**: Okay.
**Acannon**: Just how they have a plan.
**Acannon**: But like you say, if they don't Even, like, all that space now can become racks.
**Speaker 7**: Yeah.
**Acannon**: Because they don't need.
**Acannon**: I guess they park them wherever they park them, but.
**Speaker 7**: Right.
**Jremillard**: And, Jesse, you've won this bid.
**Jremillard**: I mean, you guys are actually in construction now on the site.
**Acannon**: We're supposed to start the lighting portion in two weeks.
**Jdawson**: So just before we break, I'll show you this.
**Jdawson**: You can see the video, just so you know.
**Jdawson**: Then I'll walk you through it.
**Jdawson**: That's the operator pulling into the operator alley.
**Jdawson**: He just went.
**Jdawson**: He pushed the button.
**Jdawson**: The robot arm's going to take the battery out and put a new one in.
**Jdawson**: You can see these light curtains that come across the operator alley.
**Jdawson**: That's for safety.
**Jdawson**: So when the system's engaged, nobody can walk in.
**Jdawson**: And that's the only two openings to the system.
**Jdawson**: So if somebody were to break that light curtain, robot arm's going to stop.
**Jdawson**: Once that impediment's cleared, they push the button again, and the robot arm picks up right where it left off.
**Jdawson**: Where the button is, where you see that operator standing, there's a presence pad.
**Jdawson**: Operator has to physically be standing on that pad.
**Jdawson**: If they get off the pad within five seconds, the arm's going to stop.
**Speaker 7**: Right.
**Jdawson**: If an operator tries to sit on the truck and have his buddy push the button, the camera at the end of arm will sense that and won't engage.
**Jdawson**: There's cameras and sensors all inside the cell.
**Jdawson**: So if you break inside the cell, there's a light curtain on the.
**Jdawson**: On the inside of the cell, which I'll show you here, right across here.
**Jdawson**: If you walk past that, the system will engage, and you actually have to physically do a safety reset on the system, which is just a push of the button.
**Jdawson**: It just takes longer for the robot to recalibrate itself, and it monitors itself at all times.
**Jdawson**: So, I mean, the system is very well designed, engineered that checks every box for the customer, and they're going to have a ton of questions.
**Jdawson**: So happy to have a call with them.
**Jdawson**: If you can get initial interest, whatever you need from us to get to them, you let us know.
**Acannon**: Yeah.
**Acannon**: Okay.
**Acannon**: Yeah, I'm gonna make a call as soon as we get off the line here and.
**Acannon**: And set something up.
**Jdawson**: Of course, you've got the.
**Jdawson**: You found it on the.
**Jdawson**: On the Internet.
**Jdawson**: So I'm sure they'll.
**Jdawson**: They'll go look it up as well.
**Jdawson**: And I can.
**Acannon**: Well, if you send me, email me all this information, that would be half the battle.
**Acannon**: I don't try to.
**Acannon**: I'm not the best explainer, so be Better if I had this stuff here.
**Jdawson**: And we have a, we have a little ROI app.
**Jdawson**: We do some pretty intense calculations with the customer to show them any, any of the metrics that we talk through.
**Jdawson**: Electricity savings, productivity savings, space savings, uptime and maintenance savings.
**Jdawson**: At the end of the day, we've got all that that we can walk through the customer.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Acannon**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: All right, well, we'll send this over.
**Greg.brandt**: To you, Jesse, we'd be happy to meet with you and Siva as well.
**Greg.brandt**: We have a relationship with Siva.
**Greg.brandt**: Do you work with Ashley Young by any chance?
**Acannon**: No, guy named Bill.
**Acannon**: Okay, main contact over there.
**Acannon**: And then so Jennifer, I think she's the infrastructure person for that.
**Acannon**: So I was going to get in touch with her and talk her through it.
**Greg.brandt**: Well, just let us know if you want us to help walk through this.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, for sure.
**Acannon**: I mean, I'll talk to her and especially if she's never seen this before, then I'm sure she'll be interested because I know the lifts and the batteries and all that that they're buying was an issue.
**Acannon**: So this may solve that issue.
**Acannon**: It solves my power issue.
**Tj.shelters**: Yeah.
**Greg.brandt**: And one, one last thing just to add, our largest customers are reoccurring customers.
**Greg.brandt**: So once they go into a facility, they're like, which one can you do next?
**Greg.brandt**: And really our largest, they're one of the largest food service companies.
**Greg.brandt**: They have started doing it in all of their new facilities because they've learned that it saved them like multi hundred thousand dollars in electrical infrastructure just alone.
**Jdawson**: On all their internal.
**Jdawson**: And they're very mature.
**Jdawson**: Buying Oregon, I'm certain cbis too, and their internal calculations for savings and they turn them in on every order.
**Jdawson**: They say, they say, they say about $600,000 in a new building by deploying it.
**Jdawson**: We fought with them on that because that's actually.
**Jdawson**: It's more.
**Jdawson**: And he goes, I know, I know, but this is the way we have to calculate it.
**Jdawson**: And now it's, it's not even a physical ROI for us anymore because we don't have to spend the money.
**Jdawson**: So now it just sits as we didn't spend the money, not we saved the money.
**Jdawson**: It's actually about $1.2 million because the building footprint's different and the infrastructure is less.
**Jdawson**: So go ahead.
**Acannon**: Could, could you send me like a one line drawing of what it.
**Acannon**: What's needed to power up your system?
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Acannon**: Because that'll help me with my electricians pricing it too because I can show them then I can price the difference between.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Acannon**: Wiring up all these chargers and wiring up your system.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: The customer.
**Jdawson**: Evan just referenced my.
**Jdawson**: My favorite thing about them is they have a mission.
**Jdawson**: They want to be bigger than Cisco.
**Jdawson**: So it's not Cisco.
**Jdawson**: That's not the customer.
**Jdawson**: And they're doing everything in their power to be better than Cisco.
**Jdawson**: That's why they're deploying this system and others, because the throughput we talk through is real.
**Jdawson**: They're 10 to 12 better than Cisco because they have it.
**Jdawson**: That's the way they think about it.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: So they're scaling the system very fast because that's who they want to be.
**Jdawson**: Which I think is a pretty unique story.
**Jdawson**: And it's a good marketing pitch for us too, so.
**Jdawson**: Love it.
**Acannon**: So it's good.
**Acannon**: I like it.
**Acannon**: Like the three months though.
**Acannon**: Like we'd be, you know, Alex, you know, they're all under the gun for this, so.
**Speaker 7**: Right.
**Acannon**: Like dialing in that.
**Acannon**: Because there's a big difference between three and six months.
**Jdawson**: Here's the best part.
**Jdawson**: Our system's not hard.
**Jdawson**: I mean, it's 750amps.
**Jdawson**: It's three cabinets.
**Jdawson**: If they decided to add a fourth, you would add one more 250amp.
**Jdawson**: All the other stuff that comes with your infrastructure, we don't need it.
**Jdawson**: We just got to get the batteries on order.
**Jdawson**: That's the long pole in the tent.
**Jdawson**: The rest of the system, hell, I could have deployed in probably two.
**Jdawson**: That's gonna be the battery inventory.
**Acannon**: And they may only need half of like they would only need half of these anyways, you know, in end of September.
**Acannon**: And then, you know, as we finish more of the racking and more of the.
**Acannon**: The build out, you know, it finish up a couple months later.
**Acannon**: So even if you get some of the stuff, you know, if it's not a problem to get half the batteries here in three months and the rest and four or five.
**Acannon**: You know.
**Greg.brandt**: We can also help coordinate any.
**Greg.brandt**: I mean we're a power company, so we handle everything from backup critical ups, solar ess, all the way to forklift batteries.
**Greg.brandt**: We have to hive.
**Greg.brandt**: But we also do lead acid, you know, standard lithium 1:1.
**Greg.brandt**: So if we need to help get them by, you know, if they need trucks in two weeks, we can also help coordinate that.
**Jdawson**: And diesel, diesel gensets and natural gas gen sets.
**Jdawson**: If you guys have those on site, we service, maintain and sell those.
**Jdawson**: That's Justin's Balliwick.
**Acannon**: So for whatever reason, there's no generator and they don't want one.
**Acannon**: So I guess.
**Jdawson**: But when you lose power, call me they'll need one.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Can't charge your hive without power.
**Jdawson**: Well, I think.
**Jdawson**: I think we've.
