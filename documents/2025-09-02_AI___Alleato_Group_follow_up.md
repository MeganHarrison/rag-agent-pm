## Transcript

**Maria Calcetero:**
Hello. Hi, Ashley. How are you? Good. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Can you see me? 

**Maria Calcetero:**
No, I cannot. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Okay. I think, I think it will. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Okay. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Yay. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Hello. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Happy Monday. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
How was your weekend? Good. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
It was good, but it was like so calming. It was so nice now. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Yeah. Did you enjoy your holiday? 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Yeah, yeah, it was just like I got to sleep in, got to do everything I would do on Sunday. It was my sister's birthday, so it was nice. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Yeah. Yeah. That's good. Okay, perfect. So let's see. So did you get the chance to review those? I actually had a comparison chart between those and you know like the pricing wise and everything. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
I didn't follow up with the pricing completely. I've just done the free trial a little bit. I did motion and the quill bill. I didn't explore too much on Merlin, but I really like motion just because it connects with a lot. It connects with like notion. It could really look in your emails. It gives you like suggestions. So you won't even really need quill bill if we use motion. And I know, I know some, I know it's a little pricey with some like packages they have, but I think it's really worth it because it can. It just like connects with motion and it like organizes everything. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
So now we're, you know, in our company. How can we use it? Like you know what should be like an option to use motion with? Like for what? For accounting, for marketing. For our what? Marketing is different but from our side for how facilitate the life of everybody. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
I explored it like just for like myself and then I also did a lot of like research with chat, GBT and Google for motion as well. And I looked up examples and I watched a little bit of videos on how motion works and here are like some jotted notes. Let me just share my screen so you guys can see. So these are my, these are my notes really fast. This is just a motion. So it kind of, it kind of shows you how. It pretty much like my favorite thing was like tracking statistics because it connects with your outlook. So it tracks like all of the tasks you put in Outlook or even Notion. And it just puts all the data together to make like a little chart and everything. But I think everybody in the office could use it. And then I think there are some options for marketing but I didn't deep dive into that. So for example, like when I pasted a draft email, it rephrased it. So like, so for example like quill belt, Quill bot. Sorry, Quillbot doesn't it like offers some. It offers pretty much like what Motion would do. So we wouldn't even need Quillbot. It's just like, that's just addition because it's free. But Motion offers pretty much everything. Like it's like literally your own AI assistant. And instead of manually tracking statistics, making like to do lists, it even. It even tracks, I believe your meetings sometimes with Notion. So I think that's really great. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Okay, so that's good. But if you track the meeting, is it like different from Fireflies or. I mean, Motion offers more than just the transcript of the meetings, correct? 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Yeah, yeah, it offers more in the way of like, it will actually, I think Fire, it's very similar to Fireflies because if you go back to study and review and Fireflies, it gives you like the, the highlighted points, what's important, what you need to do, what the other person needed to do. From like a discussion. Emotion pretty much does the same thing. It just keeps it all in one place. So it keeps everything all in one place from like, just like all your information. Instead of having to go to Fireflies and review it all, it kind of like transcripts it to this location. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Gotcha. Okay, and what was the other one? Motion and Quillbot. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
It was Quillbot, which is the. It's just the tool that like this. It's this thing. So it pretty much just checks your grammar, gives you recommendation if you want to rephrase anything. This is the free one. The premium gives you better and more options. And it's fairly cheap as well. This is what it looks like. And then Merlin, I didn't get to deep dive into for productive AI tools. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
And Merlin. Do you remember what we said about Merlin? It was more about. I think it's more for organization. I think it is. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
I. I don't remember Merlin too much. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Okay. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
I don't think it was AI. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
So based on your experience, it'll be worth it to have Motion or not? 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
I think it would be worth it to have Motion. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Okay, so that's you. Brandon is here, correct? I don't see. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Yeah, yeah, I see. Brandon, just yourself. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
I'm sorry, Brandon, do you have questions for Motion for the. That one. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Well, so let's think about what our end goal is. Right? So the whole point of using an AI is to eliminate repetitive tasks and essentially make us more efficient and save money, therefore increase bottom line. So right now you looked at motion and it's got some built in stuff. My question is, all that stuff that you looked at, did you look at and say, all right, well what does Notions AI do? Are we even using Notion to the full extent, what else can it do that we're not doing? Just looking at stuff. For instance, I just googled real quick motion versus Notion. Right. To see exactly what the differences are. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Right. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
You know, so it's, you know, different things and then is there other AIs that you can do? You know? You know, it looks like, you know, the, you know, based off of what I'm reading this, you know, business dive.com, motion versus notion. You know, it's given. It's given notion a 4.7, I think in motion of 4.1, just off the. What it's showing. I mean, they both have extensive integrations. Notion's more cost effective. It looks like notes, project management templates, AI. So, like, Notion has AI writing assistant, just like Motion. It looks like AI note taking as well. You know, auto scheduling, meetings, task management, project management, team collaboration, AI notetaker, AI docs, AI employees. You know, so looking at that, right? So it's like, okay, like, Motion offers all these things. Are any of them really that good? You know, because you can have a bunch of buzzwords, but what do they actually do? Right? So, like, you know, did you. Did you sign up and actually try Motion? Because I know AJ uses Motion, you know, because we looked at. We looked at Motion two and a half years ago when we were looking at Motion versus Notion, and basically what we found was that Motion is not as flexible. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Yeah. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
I didn't get to compare it to Notion, so that's definitely something I need to consider and do my own research on as well, because I wasn't. I didn't even know that. Like, I just don't know too much about Notions AI addition to, like, what we use on the daily. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
What does AJ say about motion? 

**Brandon Clymer:**
What? 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
What does AJ say about motion? 

**Brandon Clymer:**
I don't know. I mean, you have to ask aj. You know? You know, but like, when you're. When you're talking about, like, coming in and completely replacing one product with another, that, you know, the whole company runs out, we really need to make sure that we do all of our homework. Because right now what you're doing is you're suggesting something when you have not done the research or know all the information. And so therefore I'm like, well, I can't trust that recommendation because you don't know all the facts about it. You know, so when you were looking at things to automate, I would encourage you to. Instead of looking at such a big thing like that, like changing something that we used for Multiple different facets make it more granular, right? So like for instance, one thing that you know, that I'm working on is, you know, is building a sales pipeline, right? Because right now we don't have a formal sales process, it's just me. Now I could build that out and say, all right, I'm going to look at our entire company sales process and build something out. Well, now we've got, okay, we've got different customer avatars, we've got different lead generation sources and then we've got different funnels for different, you know, infrastructure sprinkler, you know, we've got owner operators ti like we've got a vast. That's a very big undertaking, right? Just like climbing Mount Everest is very big. But if you just say, all right, well I'm just going to take the first step and say I'm going to make it to that ledge there, that's way more attainable. So for me, right? So instead of doing that, I'll say, all right, I'm not going to focus on the entire company, I'm going to focus on one division vision, which is just our ASRs sprinkler division. And then I'm going to go one step further and say, okay, all I want to do is just find an AI that can go out and generate leads. Just go out and scrape different websites of companies like high tech, like Zion, like gpc, like all the our current clients go through scrape websites, find me contact information of key people. Like if I can just solve that one thing, then that's one thing that could do it. And Now I have 500 leads and then I can say, all right, now I need to find a way to reach out to them without me having to call them. So how can I solve that? And that's when you start to build a system to take away actual tasks, right? Instead of going in and saying I'm going to learn this big massive thing that does all these things and we're going to reinvent the wheel and it's going to take, you know, six to 18 months to implement because Notion has taken two years to get to where we're at. You know, I mean it's these big project management, these are big massive things, right? And so again, look at very granular, right? What is one small thing, you know that, that, that you can do, right? Like so, like, like I mentioned last week, just going in and looking at ChatGPT agent, you know, what is this? And again, like there's a ton of other things like when you look at Motion, the first thing I, when I, whenever you're showing me this and I'm looking at it and it's like, okay, like, you know, this, you know, AI work workplace. Like it's got these tasks and all that stuff. Like, all right, that's pretty cool. Like, and it looks cool. How can I find, you know, the things that I actually want? Like for instance, Motion offers an AI executive assistant, a sales rep, customer support, marketing, you know, AI research, all these other things. Like, okay, well we probably don't need all of those. We don't need a project manager. You know, we don't use, you know, support specialists, sales, like all these kind of things. We don't use, you know, like what is things that could be cool. All right, well they've got this AI executive assistant. How does that work? Maybe I could look at something simple, right? You know, or like, hey, I want to get into marketing, right? So maybe I'd look at, how can I automate marketing? Like something as simple as. Again, like I talked about last week was there's ways that you can automate and say, all right, hey, this is going to go out and find the top rated posts that are getting the most traction in this, that and the other, and then take those posts, put them into a notion template under marketing, and then it can take those, put them and repurpose them into a lito blog post or this, that and the other. Now you're starting to create a system of something that can actually be automated. Right. To, to do things. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
So for the marketing site, we have another one that is called Jasper AI. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
What did you say? Hold on a second, hold on. Ashley, what were you going to ask? 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Oh, I just said I just got it. Like I got your complete vision on everything. So now I'm just like processing how to move forward. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah, I mean, again, the vision is to, to automate things that allow you to focus on things that you want to focus on and be in your zone of genius. Right. And to do that, it's much easier to start with the small things. Right. You just think that's anything in life. Right. If you say I want to, I want to run a marathon, you don't start off running a marathon. You say, I'm going to run a mile, you know, and then build up from there. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Yeah. Small steps. Okay, perfect. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
What, what else did you have? Ashley? 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Ashley, you also got Quill bit. Quill book. That's the one you're using, correct? 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Yeah, that's the one I use. Just like on the Side for like grammar, for like any emails, word documents, just because it like focuses on all of the corrections. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
And so, so if I go into Alito Group, where are we like putting this information? 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
I just have it in a Word document that I could put into our Alito group OneDrive for all of us to access. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah. So like, if we look at, you know, you know, like I'm, you know, I'm coming in here, I go to resources, I look at AI tools to review, you know, that's got. I'm not sure who filled this out. It looks like August 26, Maria and Ashley, please review is what I tagged you guys in. Did you guys see that? 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Yes. I tagged you from your account. I tag us from your account. So that's. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah. So like, you know, this is where we're, you know, looking at. Right. So it's. You got motion, stuff like that. So, you know, you can add all these things in here and kind of what they do and links and whatnot so we can start to track it. So, you know, what's this? It looks like, you know, Jasper, you have. Is approved. So what's, what's. I've heard of Jasper. What is it exactly? 

**Maria Calcetero:**
No, so this is just like a test that we were doing with Ashley just to show her how to add like, you know, the tabs. The tab, the table and everything in Notion. But to be honest with you, I think to have like a better organization, we need to create like a little database. Not just like this one, just the database itself, just to create the link and then approve, not approve or in review, et cetera. But the thing is, so Ashley was reviewing the productivity one for the teams in general and I was reviewing the marketing one. So that's why we have those first. But then. So Ashley, so my question to you also was like, based on what Brandon said, you're using it but you don't think it's worth it or not for the team based on your experience, because you have been using it for a while. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
I think it's beneficial just because it's on like Google, it's on Word, it's on Microsoft360. So I think it's like it's a little something, like it just changes something little, which is great. But if I can look into Notion and see like if Notion has an AI tool that we could use for like at least our emails, so we don't have to use Quill Bot, that would be, I think more beneficial because it seems like Motion and Notion have like very similar. They have very similar tools. So I feel like if Motion has it, Notion definitely has it. I just have to figure out how to connect it to Outlook. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yep. And so like with your Quill thing, whatever that is, you know, one thing, any, any time you look at a. Some sort of software AI, whatever, and you're like, oh, this is cool, one of the first things I would do is say, what are some other alternatives to Quill? And be like, all right, here it is. Right. And again, you can, you could. Did you get the. You should have gotten an invite to ChatGPT, correct? 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Yeah, I have it. Yeah, I have it saved. I use it every day. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah. So you can go in there and even ask it that question. Right. You know, and ChatGPT can help. You know, hey, what are what. Here's what I'm looking for. What are AIs that I can check out? Please provide me with links and you can go check them out. Makes it so much easier. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Right. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
And so again, looking at that, it would be key because when you just look at, oh, this thing helps me with my grammar. Well. And I don't look at anything else, for all you know, it's really crappy. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Yeah. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
You know what I mean? So, like, at the end of the day, right, like, making an educated decision comes down to knowledge. Because when you have one choice, you have no choice. Two choices is a dilemma. Three options is an actual choice, you know, and so you want to make sure that you look at other options and see what's out there and actually educate yourself. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Noted. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
So that's on the productivity side, right. We don't have. The other one was Marilyn, but we couldn't get a chance to test that one. Correct. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Correct. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
And then from the marketing side, we did have one that is called Jasper AI. The competitor is called Copy AI. And they actually, they are really good in terms of marketing. For example, if you want to create content or blog post or everything, they kind of like ask you for your website. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
So you said it's. So I see Jasper. And what was the other one? 

**Maria Calcetero:**
That was a. Compare the competitor. A competitor, but it's not there. It's called Copy AI AI. So if you go to their main dashboard, you will see that it says a complete marketing dashboard and setup. So for a blog post agent, for an email campaign agent, Instagram post agent. So everything in just one place related to marketing. And I remember you wanted, you know. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
To have everything like this is Jasper. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
This is Copy AI. Why? Because Jasper AI is expensive. Jasper is good in terms of it's Similar to Copy AI. It's a little bit. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Are you looking at Copy AI right now? Can you show us what you're looking at? 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Yes, I am. So if we go to. This is Copy AI. So if you see, for example, you're always on marketing team, so you will have blog post agent, email campaign agent, Instagram post agents, you can create a lot of things and kind of like that's personalize it from you what you're looking for. So I've heard some reviews, copy AI vs Jasper AI, which I couldn't pass because obviously we need to pay the pro. But Jasper AI is similar to that one. What happened is just that this one is a little bit more pro than Copy AI, but it's similar and usually what they have is they have everything in here. So you can do content creation for marketing, for example, test and visual, especially for SEO tools. For landing pages that we need to create on the website. They check plagiarism checker. But I check on some of the reviews that this is not completely accurate. Like sometimes they do have plagiarism, so we might need to be careful of that. They do, for example, have agents specifically for Instagram. So if I want to create a specific post for a little group on Instagram, they can go through our Instagram, read through it and kind of like understand the way we want to communicate and then they just create post based on that, which I think is really cool. So this is from Jasper. Again, Copy AI is the same, but Jasper is kind of like the pro version and Copy AI is like the mild version in the middle. So Jasper is, as you can see is like 69 per month. Copy AI didn't get the chance to see this, the pricing, but I can check it out later. But they do. I will start with Copy AI because the platform is actually more friendly than Jasper and they have everything here as well. So that's on the marketing side that I will suggest we should start looking into if we want to start, you know, having everything in house rather than outsource it. You know, the marketing thing. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
So, so again, so one thing I would do, right, so you know, you can go into ChatGPT, you know, with our premium, and you can create a project. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Okay, okay. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
And so you can create that project and say it's like, all right, so it's, it's whatever, AI, whatever you want to call it or marketing or whatever, it doesn't really matter. And so then that way everything, you can feed it documents and everything and it lives in that entire project. You can start different chats that represent different things and it all talks to each other. And so one thing I would do is say, all right, hey, here's what my goal is. I want to, like, I'm trying to think of ways to automate things in our business. Like, I want to start with something like marketing and being able to say, all right, so here, like, what are some options? How could I set up a workflow using different systems and AIs to be able to go out and create posts, blah, blah, blah, and then break that up into simple steps to be like, all right, like, you know, instead of creating a whole system, how can I just start to alleviate one thing? Right? So how can I go out and like I talked about, like, what's the starter? Like, how can it go out and find who it is that like, that is getting good engagement and how do we copy that? Or how do I create, you know, a customer avatar or like something, but start to ask it and help it explore ideas with you of how would I set this up? And then it's like, all right, so what are some ways, what are some different tools, you know, whether it be AI or systems or whatever, that can do this one little thing, right, this one task, you know, to be able to get me that data that I'm looking for and populate it into notion or whatever, right? You know, a sheet of some short of sort for me to track, you know, and then, you know, look at stuff like that. And then when you start to look at those options and how that works, you can look at like, all right, like, let's build a system, you know, using these. And it's like, all right, well, we can do this with three of them. Or maybe Copy AI can just do it all at one. But is the quality the same? What does it look like? A lot of this is just learning and seeing what works and trying it. But again, instead of making it into such a big, oh, we're going to do this one big thing, condense it into just simple steps and utilize the existing AI to help you to streamline that. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Yes. So one good thing also, I mean that I can check ask chatgpt is they have like integrations with Copy AI and as you can see here that you were mentioning workflows, so they can help us create it too. But then, yeah, let me. You're right. Let's just check first with Chat GPT creating the project and then how can, how can we. Because I mean, the goal is, for example, asking ChatGPT. We need to create content at least once every mean every day. For example, at least one post every day. You know, based on our previews, Instagram post based on our website, based on our blogs. Just create those workflows for us and then like you said, kind of, kind of like connected to notion and then from there we'll handle it. The publishing and scheduling, which is again. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Like if you give it your end goal. The end goal is to. For our marketing to create authority, show subject matter expertise. Like how are some. What are some things that we can do? Right? Like, you know, is that like, do we have to. Is it, you know, taking. Doing different questions and interviews, you know, with myself that we take and we cut up and it uses it into different formats. You know, it's also, you know, you know, taking stuff that is very like engaged online and then repurposing it, adding our own spin. Like there's a lot of different options to look at and see how that works. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Mm. Okay. We'll integrate it with ChatGPT. That's. Yeah, that's true. So this was one Jasper versus copy AI, which I personally think copy is more friendly and Jasper is just too much for what we're looking for. I mean at the end if it has like the integration for ChatGPT, we can definitely check that out as well. But I will start with ChatGPT like you mentioned and then we'll see copy AI. The other ones was midjourney, which is. I have used it in the past, which is amazing for image creation. But I don't think it's worth for us right now in terms of creating like or paying for the, for the design of those images because we don't use it. We can have in house photos. We can have, you know, like even from the events that we have blog posts. I mean I don't think you necessarily to pay for midjourney in order to have like a specific image for our industry. I don't think so. It's good. It's really cool. It's very nice. It has a lot of engagement. But I don't think obviously in the past, but it's because it was a very specific topic that you cannot find everywhere. But with Alito Group, I'm pretty sure we can have photos of the projects. We have content, so I don't think we need it midjourney. The next one was this script which. That's the one you suggested, right, Brandon? We check it out. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah, I mean I can't remember what it does, but I know we have. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
A thing so it does the audio editing and transcription. So if you want to talk about. If you're recording yourself saying go to homepage, go here. So actually, you know, the. The AI kind of like follows what you're trying to explain and then you kind of like create a nice explanatory video or tutorials for other people. So that's good. I think it's good. You've used it in the past and I think we can use it. One second, please give me one second. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Overall, while Maria's gone, I will go ahead and do more research just to have more data and so we can talk more about like our options and what we can use and just. I'll just focus on one thing at a time instead of like multiple divisions. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Okay? 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Yep. Sorry. My daughter was just crying and I was scared about nothing happening. Anyway, so checking on the script. So you use it random but you keep it as a free trial, Correct. It's just for you, not as a company one. Correct. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah, I mean, I think I've used it once. Like I don't use it. I can't remember what I think. I was just exploring stuff and tried it. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Yeah. So we can use it for free as here. We want like one hour transcript. If it's beyond that, we have to pay. But other than that we can use it in terms of tutorials. I think that most people that will be beneficial with this one will be accounting. If we want to use it for Job Planner, Procore or just kind of like go here, go there. We can use it for them or for you guys, which are, you know, like kind of like creating tutorials and everything for the other people. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
That's also like Scribe does that or you know, guide and things like that. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Yes. So yeah, I mean it's free. We can use it for one hour transcription, which I think it's enough beyond that, I don't think or maybe in the future, but right now I think it's okay. We can add it as a, you know, another tool for the people to use it. Like you said, like you already sent to everybody. Use it for your own projects, even for clients. You know, if you want to send it to a client. Here is for example in, I don't know, maybe in the weekly reviews or something. You can find here these. And then we are trying to work on here. So we can maybe try to do that with the clients. Try and kind of like ask the guys to implement it there right now. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
What about this Pictionary thing? 

**Maria Calcetero:**
What Pictionary thing? 

**Brandon Clymer:**
I don't know it's on the list. Pictionary AI. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Pictionary AI. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Are you looking at notion? 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Oh, Picture AI. I think we decided not to go with that one because it was similar to midjourney. So we just skip it from Picture AI to Elements Envato. So Envato is really good for pictures for, you know, if you want like a transparent image or icons or things like that. They're really good for that. Elements Envato, which is good. We can have it for free too. It's not like we need to pay right now. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah, I mean I was just looking at, you know again, I'd have to play around with Pictory but I mean like it says like text to generate video in minutes and turn any URL into a video. I mean it looks like it's got some cool things. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Yeah. So. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Oh wait, wait. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
This is different from that one. This is a way to create professional video for everyone. I think you've suggested this one too. Picture AI. You did? Yeah. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Oh, that might have been from that event. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Yeah, from the audio. Yes. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
That one looks pretty cool. I would check it out. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Okay, we can check that out too. Oh yeah, that was it. For the marketing. You're right. For content markers just for the videos and everything. And then elements in butter. I don't think we need. It is free but we don't need to have like every time icons or like posting images, you know again, specific image that we might need. No, we have content already so we can use what we have but kind of like use it for better content and everything. Okay. But so we can check. So I'll do two things from the marketing side. So picture which we never check and then ChatGPT Connected to copy AI or Jasper or kind of like see from the projects that we can create from ChatGPT. So we can start with those two and then. Ash, you want to start? You said like one by one. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
What was that last part? One by one. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
You said. You said you want to start just based on divisions instead of. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Yeah. So I was just going to look at the productivity again for the AI and just get more research and get kind of like compare like competitors and everything regarding the ones we already looked at such as motion and look more into notion as well. Just because I want to see. I just want to compare them more and do some more deep dive research. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Okay. Yeah, sounds good. So again. So I'll just send out again and then. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah, somebody needs to create a better table or something that we can be putting all this stuff in we'll have. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
A better database to track and everything. Okay, so we'll do that in a minute. So. You know what, Ash? So we should just have everything. All the notes and everything that we have from the words document in notions once we have the database. So specific notes for this one and then pricing and then approve. So you. You all. You want to do it? You want me to do it? You want to start like create a notion or just let me know. Up to you. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Okay. Or you want to put together look in the startingpad. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Yeah. I want to make you feel more comfortable in notion too, so you don't feel. You're not scared of creating databases or anything. So let's do it. It won't take longer. Databases is very fast to do on notion. So we'll do it and then we'll start add from there and then I'll set up another meeting so we can have like another review of the ones we are deciding. Okay? 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Okay, Sounds good. Thank you, Maria. Thank you, Brandon. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Sounds good. See it. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Thank you.
