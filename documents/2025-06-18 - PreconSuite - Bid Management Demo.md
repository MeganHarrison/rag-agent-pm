## Transcript
**Bclymer**: Good fit and can meet all of the.
**Bclymer**: This meeting is being recorded your guys needs.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, we're general contractor nationally just looking at bidding software.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And do you guys have subs nationally or, or.
**Mcalcetero**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Way to.
**Bclymer**: To manage that.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so we do have a directory as well that you can pull in additional contacts.
**Bclymer**: Contractors across the US and Canada.
**Mcalcetero**: Cool.
**Mcalcetero**: Let's take a look.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So, so yeah, basically our software.
**Bclymer**: This is the big calendar.
**Bclymer**: Any job that you currently have, just put it on the calendar.
**Bclymer**: You can create templates or just copy a project if it's from a, you know, similar area or scope of work.
**Bclymer**: Here's the preferred bidders that I always like that I always use or maybe nationwide suppliers.
**Bclymer**: You can just check the trades or uncheck the trades.
**Bclymer**: You don't need to put in a new project name and a bid date.
**Bclymer**: You can copy over bid forms.
**Bclymer**: We have a leveling module as well if you wanted to use that.
**Bclymer**: But this is the body of the email the invitation a bit that goes out to your, your subs.
**Bclymer**: Just copy and paste whatever you want them to see on the invite.
**Bclymer**: You can make it a public project which will share it with subs from our directory.
**Mcalcetero**: So go to.
**Mcalcetero**: Go to your bid forms.
**Mcalcetero**: Sure.
**Mcalcetero**: It's on the left there.
**Mcalcetero**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So, so each trade or, or bid package that you create, you can pull in templated questions or line items for each.
**Mcalcetero**: Like for instance, if you click into, into this job.
**Mcalcetero**: Right, so go back to your.
**Mcalcetero**: Where it says Jason or whatever the name of it is.
**Mcalcetero**: And so.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, so.
**Bclymer**: Oh, the, the, the, that project specifically was.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah, this one.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Mcalcetero**: Jason tunnel.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah.
**Mcalcetero**: So in this.
**Mcalcetero**: All right, so in, in your.
**Mcalcetero**: Jason Tunnel.
**Mcalcetero**: So bidders by trade.
**Mcalcetero**: So are you like, are you able to split it up?
**Mcalcetero**: Like you've got code which I guess that's CSI code.
**Mcalcetero**: Is that what you're thinking?
**Mcalcetero**: Like can you split it up by you know, 03 Castle Place Concrete and like then 8, 9, 10.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, so, so you can break it up however you'd like.
**Bclymer**: So these, this is by trade.
**Bclymer**: And your, the way that your system is organized is determined just by however you guys want it to be set up.
**Bclymer**: So we have a lot of heavy highway civil companies who don't use CSI codes.
**Bclymer**: They'll just use, you know, aggregates, list them all alphabetically.
**Bclymer**: But you can customize the code, the trade and then ultimately how you select and organize your bidders list.
**Bclymer**: If you wanted to break and say you have all of your concrete guys, you know, wherever they are.
**Bclymer**: Here.
**Bclymer**: And if you wanted them all to fill out the same concrete bid form, you basically create a bid package that has, you know, anybody that's within these trades will get this invitation to bid with this bid date and they can have their own, you know, bid form that they could fill out.
**Mcalcetero**: So is there a way, for instance, like if you go to so ads click add a big package.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Admin package.
**Mcalcetero**: Yep, yep.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay.
**Mcalcetero**: And so, so let's just say dock equipment, you know.
**Mcalcetero**: All right.
**Mcalcetero**: And then.
**Mcalcetero**: So that's the bid package name.
**Mcalcetero**: And so you're going to select a trade.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Mcalcetero**: So basically go down to 11.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: You could add in whatever trades you want basically to see that bid package.
**Bclymer**: Here's my.
**Mcalcetero**: And then, so is there like.
**Mcalcetero**: So when you go to add.
**Mcalcetero**: Right.
**Mcalcetero**: So we've got all this now, you know, let's say, you know, whatever this project's in Oklahoma.
**Mcalcetero**: And when you go to invite bidders, can you pick who you're inviting or does it just send it to everybody in the area?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So from here I, I would go to select bidders and you can choose a number of different ways.
**Bclymer**: Now from here, basically what we would do is take your sub list, import it into your system so that you have everybody in here.
**Mcalcetero**: Let's say there's.
**Mcalcetero**: There's no sub list.
**Mcalcetero**: Let's say again, this is in Oklahoma.
**Mcalcetero**: We've never worked there.
**Mcalcetero**: So I've got to find companies that do this.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So basically you go to the, go to our directory.
**Bclymer**: So that way you get there just search pipeline directory.
**Bclymer**: You type in a zip code and the radius that you want to pull from, hit next and then go down to whatever trades you need and then hit next.
**Bclymer**: The queries are database and then you can import those companies into your system.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, but that doesn't, I mean looking at this like location, it doesn't tell me or is this.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay, so rapid grading is the name.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Company name where they're located.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: If they match any of the kind of filtered will like affiliate.
**Mcalcetero**: So I've got to import that.
**Mcalcetero**: And like if you import it, you import it and then I go like it'll only pull from these people like in the other window once.
**Bclymer**: So once you import this company, then they'll be searched.
**Bclymer**: Then they're in your database.
**Bclymer**: That's your data.
**Bclymer**: You can use it to continue to invite people to know anything.
**Mcalcetero**: So, so then can I not just, you know, because we have jobs all over the country, so wouldn't I just, I guess import every single sub there is, and then when I have again, I'm building this dock equipment package, I just go into to that and pick, you know, who I want or something or.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, basically, I mean, you're, you're basically just selecting by trade and you don't even, you don't need to use bid packages.
**Bclymer**: Bid packages.
**Bclymer**: Basically, if you, if you have a custom scope of work, you want to limit plan room visibility for each of these or like combine multiple trades to have one bid form.
**Bclymer**: But the way that most people do it is just go to select bidders by trade.
**Bclymer**: Here's a list of all the companies in your database.
**Bclymer**: Now let's filter it down to within 100 miles of the project and then, and then just import the trades that you need for each, for, for this job.
**Bclymer**: And then sl.
**Mcalcetero**: But if I, if I say that I wanted to, like, you know, you've got 52 for asphalt, right?
**Mcalcetero**: Well, say I don't, I don't want to invite 52.
**Mcalcetero**: Right.
**Mcalcetero**: Like, can I not just go in there and select five out of the 52?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, absolutely.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: And, and there's a couple different ways you can do it.
**Bclymer**: I mean, by trade, individually go into your asphalt and just unhighlight the star or just highlight the star of the companies you want to add.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: You can sort by any of these columns, but this will list out all the companies in your database within that trade using any filters that you want.
**Mcalcetero**: And what about if I want to, you know, say somebody isn't in the database and I want to invite them to this bid package?
**Mcalcetero**: You know, like, I got their email.
**Mcalcetero**: How do I do that?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, so just click the plus button here.
**Bclymer**: Create company and just put in a new company.
**Bclymer**: The name and email address is really all you need.
**Mcalcetero**: And then will it tell me if there's already a duplicate?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah, it'll pop up and say, no, a company already exists.
**Bclymer**: Go to the record and then you, you know, put in the trade update and then to projects invite, here's a list of all the current jobs you guys have bidding.
**Bclymer**: So you could add them to all the current projects that you guys have or just the one that in that area.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Mcalcetero**: And so what does bid leveling look like?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, leveling.
**Bclymer**: So on the bid form, if I choose like this, this form here.
**Bclymer**: So if I go in and create a new bid form, let's see if I, I've added one for this project.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Basically you can create templates for each trade or group of trades.
**Bclymer**: It'll say, okay, hey, do you want to start from scratch, do you want to import or use a template?
**Bclymer**: And so if I had a template for each of these, I could click in and see.
**Bclymer**: Okay, here's the basic templated bid form that I have for these trades along with any questions that you want to ask.
**Bclymer**: It's like a project checklist or date the drawings, you know, where, where that they're bidding on or from or how many dentists they've seen.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: General acknowledgments.
**Bclymer**: And then you, but you can edit these forms to show whatever questions that you want.
**Bclymer**: And so you can also import from Excel.
**Mcalcetero**: But when I say bid leveling, like so for instance, you know, like it should show their bid and their numbers of different line items.
**Mcalcetero**: And I can click on and off like, yeah, alternates, things like that.
**Bclymer**: Yep, yep.
**Bclymer**: So this is what it would look like after it's submitted.
**Bclymer**: You got your, your companies up top, their numbers that they submitted.
**Bclymer**: Anything in yellow is overridden or like a plug number, they're excluding it.
**Bclymer**: Or if you negotiated down.
**Bclymer**: And then underneath, basically there's, there's alternates and you probably wouldn't maybe not have as much text here, but you got your total bids plus any overrides and then any alternates that you can toggle on or off.
**Bclymer**: And then that total bid adjusted with overrides in alternates down at the bottom.
**Bclymer**: So it'll kind of rank them low to high, left to right.
**Mcalcetero**: Then.
**Mcalcetero**: So how much customization does this thing have?
**Bclymer**: It's fully customizable.
**Bclymer**: Any question?
**Bclymer**: Everything on the left is, is a custom question that, that we created on this bid form.
**Mcalcetero**: Gotcha.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay, and then as far as like, for this, you know, this entire, what did this used to be called?
**Mcalcetero**: Something else.
**Mcalcetero**: Is this in like, did you guys change names?
**Bclymer**: We.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, a couple years ago we changed names from Pipeline Suite to Pre Con Suite.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Mcalcetero**: All right, is, is, is, is ice.
**Mcalcetero**: Did you guys buy I square foot too?
**Mcalcetero**: Or is that.
**Bclymer**: No, no, two, two separate companies.
**Bclymer**: We just changed the name.
**Bclymer**: Just better describe kind of what, what all we offer.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay.
**Mcalcetero**: All right.
**Mcalcetero**: And then so if, is there an open API for this program?
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Open API.
**Bclymer**: What, what other softwares are you guys using?
**Bclymer**: Because we do have some built out integrations with procore.
**Bclymer**: We don't.
**Bclymer**: No, not with Job Planner, just basically just with procore and HCSS pre built.
**Bclymer**: But we do have an open API.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay, all right.
**Mcalcetero**: And then so what are your rates?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, pricing is based on number of users that you guys need to have access 150amonth for the first user, 50 for each additional.
**Bclymer**: And then the only other add ons are bid forms and the pre.
**Bclymer**: Qual.
**Bclymer**: And then we have a, like an email cleanup service as well if you needed that.
**Mcalcetero**: What's an email cleanup service?
**Bclymer**: Basically, access to a team of callers that will call any bounced email that you guys have, find the new contact, keep your, your database up to date.
**Mcalcetero**: Oh, gotcha.
**Mcalcetero**: Gotcha.
**Mcalcetero**: And so the, the 150.
**Mcalcetero**: And then it's another.
**Mcalcetero**: Where's the bid forms at?
**Bclymer**: That's this right here.
**Mcalcetero**: So that's 300amonth per user.
**Bclymer**: Just, just 150 total for the company for the bid forms.
**Mcalcetero**: Oh, so it's.
**Mcalcetero**: So it's 150amonth for the bid forms.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Mcalcetero**: And then it's.
**Mcalcetero**: And then It's.
**Mcalcetero**: You said 150 for the first user, the 50 each additional.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Mcalcetero**: Is that for nationwide?
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Basically, I mean there's no limit on the number of projects or where you can send your invites, anything like that.
**Bclymer**: How many projects do you guys, I mean are you, are you bidding on in, in any given month or per year?
**Mcalcetero**: 100 a year maybe.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And, and all over.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So yeah, the one thing I would say is that the, I mean our directory is a.
**Bclymer**: Like you got to import each company one at a time.
**Mcalcetero**: We can't mass import.
**Bclymer**: No.
**Mcalcetero**: Oh, that's stupid.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So I, and, and honestly I don't know if if based on the volume you guys are doing and, and kind of the approach nationwide that we would be the best fit for that.
**Bclymer**: Just I think.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, basically like it's.
**Bclymer**: If you're looking for more kind of a, kind of a mass approach, a company like Building Connected might be a better suited option to be completely honest.
**Mcalcetero**: Gotcha.
**Mcalcetero**: What about Construct Connect?
**Mcalcetero**: Do you know anything about them?
**Bclymer**: I, I'm not as familiar with Construct Connect or how they.
**Bclymer**: Their approach is, but that, yeah, I'm not, not 100.
**Mcalcetero**: Sure.
**Mcalcetero**: Gotcha.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay, cool.
**Mcalcetero**: I, I appreciate the honesty.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Appreciate your time.
**Bclymer**: And yeah, if you have any more questions, just let me know.
**Mcalcetero**: Awesome.
**Mcalcetero**: Thanks man.
**Mcalcetero**: See you.
