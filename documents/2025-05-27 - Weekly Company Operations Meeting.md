**Bclymer**: Just waiting on the final payment from the owner.
**Gducharme**: So just so everyone knows, we in our meeting today with the accounting team, I've asked them to kind of take the lead in helping us meet all of our accounting dates.
**Gducharme**: Like they're going to notify you on the 25th, make sure you've got all your sub billings approved and processed.
**Gducharme**: And then they're going to notify you by the first to make sure if you haven't turned in the owner's billing, you know, then they're going to notify you again that our PSRs are getting in by no later than the 5th of the following month.
**Gducharme**: And then they're also going to check in on payments from owners and just let everyone know, you know, if we're not getting paid in a timely manner so that we can all follow up and make sure all those things happen.
**Bclymer**: Oh, you can put.
**Bclymer**: There's an inspection for this project.
**Adelgado**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: You want it as a task or just as a comment?
**Bclymer**: It can be a task.
**Gducharme**: The life safety plans, do we get them paid for Nick, so that he can.
**Bclymer**: I don't think we.
**Bclymer**: We paid for them.
**Gducharme**: So we need to get that paid because this inspections on the 6th, I think of June and they need that stamped plan by then, so.
**Gducharme**: And if we have anyone.
**Adelgado**: When do you want this due date to be?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, you can put today.
**Adelgado**: Today.

**Adelgado**: Okay, perfect.
**Gducharme**: But the inspection, Nick, is on the 6th, is it not?
**Bclymer**: I believe so.
**Gducharme**: So do you know, has the invoice been sent to accounting to pay for the life safety plans?
**Gducharme**: Because we can't get the stamp set.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I'll do that right now.

**Adelgado**: Siva Consulting sees Brandon.
**Adelgado**: Jesse.
**Gducharme**: So Brandon sent him the invoices.
**Gducharme**: Copies of them again.
**Gducharme**: They're claiming it's some glitch in the system.
**Adelgado**: So he has to send them.

**Adelgado**: Oh, okay.
**Adelgado**: Okay, Gotcha.
**Adelgado**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: So it's not a task.
**Adelgado**: So it's just.
**Adelgado**: Okay, so let me just change this.
**Adelgado**: So you were waiting on it?
**Gducharme**: Yeah, it's the payments.
**Adelgado**: Okay, perfect.
**Adelgado**: This is Nick, Goodwill Corp office.
**Bclymer**: That we're renewing our.
**Bclymer**: Our general contractor license in Indianapolis.
**Bclymer**: We're waiting to hear back from the city on if it's approved.
**Bclymer**: Agent aj, I think was making a payment today.
**Gducharme**: Did you talk to A.J.
**Gducharme**: today about that, Nick?
**Bclymer**: No, but A.J.
**Bclymer**: sent an email asking about the status, and then the city responded saying they need payment.
**Gducharme**: So can we pay with the card?
**Bclymer**: That I'm not sure.
**Gducharme**: Message aj.
**Adelgado**: Okay, I'll get back to that one, Jesse, once you get a response.
**Adelgado**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: Glenn Westfield Collective.
**Ataylor**: My notes are updated in here.
**Ataylor**: Whoops.
**Ataylor**: So I got a update from Ryan as a city today.
**Gducharme**: Is.
**Ataylor**: Is Brandon on here?
**Ataylor**: We were talking about this earlier.
**Ataylor**: Now, we should have our platting done hopefully by the end of the week.
**Ataylor**: All of our part is done.
**Ataylor**: It's with them to combine the parcels and do the final signature.
**Ataylor**: So the building permit is under review with the building department.
**Ataylor**: Now it's past the zoning and Ryan's portion of it, so it's in the final phase.
**Ataylor**: So once the planning is done and the CDR comes in, we should be good to go.
**Ataylor**: They're saying the week of 6, 9, but potentially the end of next week.
**Ataylor**: I paid some CDR fees today, so whenever, hopefully, that releases that design so I can get the CDRs here by the end of the week.
**Ataylor**: I got an update on the gas service for the new gas line, but not the encroachment.
**Ataylor**: So the gas service for the new line would be ready probably in about two weeks.
**Ataylor**: The week of the 9th, it'll probably be ready to be installed, pending the encroachment permit and all that stuff.
**Ataylor**: And I am currently still working through with the Surveyor and the encroachment division of Centerpoint to get.
**Ataylor**: To get that dealt with and get our water line installed.
**Gducharme**: What is that whole, like, what is the delay?
**Gducharme**: I know Glenn was talking about that last week, but, like, how long does that expect to take?
**Ataylor**: The encroachment?
**Gducharme**: Whatever it takes so that we can be released to get our water line installed.
**Ataylor**: It's four to six weeks from the time they received everything.
**Ataylor**: And I am still waiting on an answer, if that clock has even started, because our surveyors, Miller surveying and the review department at Centerpoint have been going back and forth with.
**Ataylor**: With submitting what they need.
**Ataylor**: And so Nathan.
**Ataylor**: I spoke with Nathan at Miller.
**Ataylor**: He said he would get another risk.
**Ataylor**: We gotta.
**Ataylor**: We got something back from them Friday morning, so he's gonna respond to them by the end of the day before he leaves and get.
**Ataylor**: And get back with them for the last kind of last question that they.
**Ataylor**: That they had back and forth.
**Gducharme**: Why is topping out, sir?
**Gducharme**: Oh, not starting?
**Ataylor**: That's just.
**Ataylor**: That's just a placeholder.
**Ataylor**: We'll schedule that when we have a better date, when we're gonna be there.
**Ataylor**: I guess we probably.
**Ataylor**: We probably are close to close to setting the date now.
**Ataylor**: Really want to get this permit and get off the ground before we start counting our chickens.
**Adelgado**: Okay, let's move on.
**Gducharme**: Interior design.
**Gducharme**: Is that on there?
**Gducharme**: Did you already talk about that?
**Gducharme**: Like, when are we getting that.
**Ataylor**: Interior design?
**Gducharme**: The drawings.
**Ataylor**: Let me see.
**Ataylor**: Which one are you referring to?
**Ataylor**: The IFC drawings or Eli's drawings?
**Ataylor**: The new.
**Gducharme**: The new drawings we have.
**Gducharme**: So we can't finish buying out any of our interior finishes.
**Ataylor**: I mean, okay, yes, probably by.
**Ataylor**: If not by the end of the week, by the end of Monday, because the steel drawings were several days late.
**Ataylor**: And then we had the holiday weekend, so Jeff didn't get those steel drawings to even start until the end of Thursday.
**Ataylor**: So he said he'll get it wrapped up hopefully by the end of the week, if not by the end of Monday.
**Ataylor**: And that'll be his IFC set.
**Ataylor**: His models have gone or will go.
**Ataylor**: I think he's got to clean them up with all the notes and send a fresh set of revit model over to Eli so that he can do his modeling for interior design and FF&E and.
**Ataylor**: And final finishes.
**Ataylor**: So that will be a 3D model.
**Gducharme**: We're gonna have drawings by Monday.
**Gducharme**: We can buy it out.
**Gducharme**: And then the next two weeks from then, then we're done with all contracts.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, as long as everything's in those.
**Ataylor**: In those drawings that we need to finish out, I guess.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: I'm looking at countertops, the mechanical screen in the enclosure, concrete finishes and doors.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, all these finishes have been selected by the owner or they're going to propose something and then we've got to go through that selection process.
**Ataylor**: They have approved or already selected several things.
**Ataylor**: Tile, I think the corrugated metal for the bars.
**Ataylor**: As far as selecting everything else, I think it's going to be mostly on.
**Ataylor**: On the Eli side of it from damn good interiors.
**Ataylor**: The guy who did the.
**Ataylor**: The Liberty location, he's gonna have all the FF and E and all the stuff that's going to be owner selections, you know what I mean?
**Gducharme**: Okay, so right.
**Gducharme**: Commitments.
**Gducharme**: That date's already passed.
**Gducharme**: So now the new date is two weeks from Monday.
**Gducharme**: So I would change that to whatever that is.
**Gducharme**: Like all these dates where it says in progress and we're way past it.
**Ataylor**: Okay, Yeah, I can go clean up those dates.
**Ataylor**: I haven't been messing with the dates on here.
**Ataylor**: I've been using this as more of a.
**Ataylor**: Just like a checklist.
**Ataylor**: But yeah, I can update these dates.
**Gducharme**: We can't prioritize anything or.
**Gducharme**: No, we're late early or anything if we don't keep the dates updated.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, I'll get them updated right now.
**Adelgado**: Thank you.
**Adelgado**: Glenn, Cormark, Brandon, Jesse.
**Gducharme**: There's no update on that.
**Adelgado**: Spires and Lucy, Nick.
**Bclymer**: We're waiting on the final owner payment.
**Adelgado**: This is in progress, Correct.
**Gducharme**: So, Nick, is that billed for final payment retainage and it was billed when and when's it due?
**Gducharme**: Just put that due date on there when it should have been paid.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: This is aj this is AJ this is AJ this is Ugency.
**Adelgado**: I think.
**Gducharme**: So.
**Gducharme**: We received the Topo survey today from the city and we sent the city our acreage use for the proposed volleyball and container areas last week.
**Adelgado**: You send the what, Jesse?
**Adelgado**: The acres.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, the A C R E A G E.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.

**Adelgado**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: There you go.
**Gducharme**: For the containers and volleyball area.
**Adelgado**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: Don't forget also to do this is still in progress, correct?
**Adelgado**: All these things?
**Gducharme**: Yeah, we haven't started any of those.
**Gducharme**: Still.
**Gducharme**: We have not been released for design yet.
**Adelgado**: Okay, sounds good, Jesse.
**Adelgado**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: Poor collective Jesse.
**Gducharme**: Brendan, we had a meeting last or.
**Gducharme**: No, we sent them the.
**Gducharme**: The site plan last week.
**Gducharme**: They're going to give that to the city, get approval and then when we get released we'll have to do elevation drawings for the hotel.
**Gducharme**: One thing we need to do is we need to modify the current layout so it works better having the hotel and the.
**Adelgado**: Do they.
**Adelgado**: For the modifi Modification.
**Gducharme**: I'd say by.
**Gducharme**: It's going to end up being like Wednesday next week probably.
**Adelgado**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: This GC license is done, correct, Jesse?
**Adelgado**: I mean, we just need to send it out.
**Adelgado**: So it's still in progress, correct?
**Gducharme**: Yeah, just put it tomorrow.
**Gducharme**: It'll be sent by tomorrow.
**Gducharme**: It's got to print it out.
**Adelgado**: Let me change you as the owner.
**Adelgado**: You and I.
**Adelgado**: And then tomorrow it has to be.
**Adelgado**: And this is five priorities.
**Adelgado**: Okay, perfect.
**Adelgado**: Something else.
**Adelgado**: Jesse.
**Gducharme**: I think that's it for that.
**Adelgado**: Perfect.

**Adelgado**: Yeah.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, this is really Nick's.

**Bclymer**: We're going to turn in an updated or we're going to turn in our estimate this week.
**Gducharme**: You're going to add tasks for getting the design pricing, Nick.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Adelgado**: Too late for the design price.
**Bclymer**: That'll probably be by the end of next week.
**Bclymer**: Well, I guess we need that for our estimates.
**Bclymer**: So probably this week.
**Gducharme**: If we don't get it all back.
**Gducharme**: Nick.
**Gducharme**: Which I think those guys are pretty quick about getting us a price for that.
**Gducharme**: We'll have to just tell them we're working on the design price in case we have to permit it.
**Gducharme**: Well, we know we're gonna have to permit it, but.
**Adelgado**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: Jesse.
**Adelgado**: Unique kilo.

**Gducharme**: But Kevin's on here.

**Adelgado**: Kevin, how is the project going right now?
**Jdawson**: We have just sent out all of the subcontracts and we're waiting for submittals to be approved.
**Jdawson**: They were all sent out by this morning and some of the materials were ordered.
**Jdawson**: All of the electric materials were ordered.
**Jdawson**: And we are waiting for shipment and delivery.
**Jdawson**: And same for the fencing material that is also ordered.
**Gducharme**: You see, we got a new start date of 6:2.
**Jdawson**: Correct.
**Jdawson**: Yes, that's.
**Gducharme**: Did you get the fence guy the new plan today?
**Gducharme**: Because now he's gone back and forth between the original plan and the.
**Gducharme**: I didn't think about that.
**Gducharme**: We need to check.
**Jdawson**: We just finished the.
**Jdawson**: The presentation.
**Jdawson**: We just finished updating it, so.
**Gducharme**: But have you given the fence subcontractor what we have to build?
**Gducharme**: Because I think you just sent him that new plan.
**Gducharme**: So just make sure he's not confused when he shows up and what he's making.
**Jdawson**: Gotcha.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I think he already ordered the material based on the original, which we are going back to right now.
**Gducharme**: And he knows that we're Going back to it.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: Something that you want to add here, Kevin?
**Adelgado**: Like a task or anything?
**Adelgado**: Or is it good right now?
**Adelgado**: Don't forget to add also due dates here for this.

**Ataylor**: Goodwill Foundations is going through a plan review tomorrow with the owners.
**Ataylor**: Should have a permit hopefully by the end of next week.
**Ataylor**: And we will get started the following week.

**Gducharme**: Is that meeting tomorrow or.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, there's tomorrow.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, it's tomorrow.
**Ataylor**: There's a short week.
**Ataylor**: I thought.
**Gducharme**: I thought it was Thursday.
**Ataylor**: It's tomorrow at 2pm 2.
**Gducharme**: I have jury due to dairy duty tomorrow, so I may not make that meeting.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: It's the first time in my life I've ever had to do that.
**Bclymer**: I just got a notice this week for jury duty.
**Gducharme**: That's crazy.
**Ataylor**: We had like four people in the OAC injury duty this week.
**Ataylor**: And next somebody two weeks.
**Gducharme**: All I know is they're guilty.
**Gducharme**: So it should be a quick case.
**Adelgado**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: Perfect radial even.
**Adelgado**: This is who?
**Adelgado**: Brandon.
**Adelgado**: Jesse.
**Gducharme**: So this is going to be Kevin.
**Adelgado**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: So let me add you here, Kevin.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: I need to start the submittal process for this one and enter it in Project Planner.
**Jdawson**: Actually, Jesse, if you can show me.
**Jdawson**: Because right now we don't have a job folder for this.
**Jdawson**: You need to move everything from estimating to 2025 jobs.
**Gducharme**: So there's a process for that in our.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: Which I can go over with you, but it's also in our policies and procedures.
**Gducharme**: There's one on that.
**Gducharme**: I don't know if you've looked at any of those, but.
**Jdawson**: I do remember looking through it.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Gducharme**: So we.
**Gducharme**: You never create a new folder.
**Gducharme**: You simply cut and paste that folder from the estimating drive to the 2025 jobs.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: So that.
**Gducharme**: Because otherwise things get duplicated and saved in two different places.
**Gducharme**: So either at the end of the day or just make sure everyone's logged out of the folder so it doesn't not let you move the whole thing.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Gducharme**: And then you have to just create the job in Job Planner.
**Gducharme**: You pick the next available job number and that's what it'll be called.
**Gducharme**: And then you gotta let accounting know.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: That's created as well.
**Gducharme**: So they save that number.
**Adelgado**: Yep.
**Adelgado**: And don't forget to add your due dates here.
**Adelgado**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: When this is done okay.
**Adelgado**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: I think we're done with the corporate products now, moving forward to estimating.
**Adelgado**: So Jesse and Andres, this is aj.

**Gducharme**: We had a meeting last week with the landowner and Mike and they asked.
**Gducharme**: We changed the layout a little bit from the site plan that was just done.
**Gducharme**: I think we got it late last Friday based off our meeting with them.

**Gducharme**: No, it's not, because.
**Jmendez**: No.
**Gducharme**: You know you're working on that drawing for the fence, right?
**Gducharme**: So this they added, you can put in here at our last meeting.
**Gducharme**: That was the one we were talking about on the 19th, so we met after that.
**Gducharme**: Those are the meeting minutes I just sent to you, Keva.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, so we.
**Gducharme**: They added in this American Express move.
**Gducharme**: So we got that scope finalized from the meeting where Kev is working on a drawing for the fence so we can get it priced accurately.
**Gducharme**: The fence and the surround, and there's a generator.
**Gducharme**: We got a price.
**Gducharme**: I know Mike has gotten the electrician and he's gotten in touch with the plan Ops guy to get some photos of the panels and whatnot to help us get that price.
**Gducharme**: So, Andres, you'll have to reach out to that electrician that Mike's been talking to make sure he's got what he needs.
