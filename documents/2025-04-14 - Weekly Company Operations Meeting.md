**Adelgado**: Quick question on all of these.
**Adelgado**: When I go to notion and I go to projects, mine are now broken out differently than what I'm seeing on your screen.
**Adelgado**: Mine show like.
**Adelgado**: It's got like a.
**Adelgado**: I don't know how to describe it.
**Adelgado**: It's got a current projects phase and an estimating phase.
**Ataylor**: Maybe it's your view.
**Ataylor**: It's okay.
**Ataylor**: 1.
**Ataylor**: If you want, you can show me your view and then we can fix it.
**Ataylor**: Because what we did with Megan was just to have one database for Current ones and then at the bottom, another database for decimated ones.
**Bclymer**: I had the same problem, but I.
**Bclymer**: You click on the one that's just projects and then scroll down.
**Bclymer**: The estimating is at the bottom for you also.
**Ataylor**: Maybe.
**Ataylor**: Which ones are you looking at?
**Ataylor**: Are you looking at these ones?
**Ataylor**: Aj so if you just went to estimating.
**Adelgado**: I went to Alito Group and then I went.
**Adelgado**: And then under project manage.
**Adelgado**: So I went to the home screen.
**Ataylor**: Yes.
**Adelgado**: Then if I click on projects.
**Ataylor**: Yes.
**Adelgado**: Yeah.
**Adelgado**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: So that's the.
**Adelgado**: What?
**Adelgado**: That's what I'm seeing it as.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, that's okay.
**Ataylor**: Why?
**Ataylor**: Because we have different databases.
**Adelgado**: It all updates in the same space though, right?
**Ataylor**: Yes, everything is in the same space.
**Ataylor**: So the current ones are here and estimating ones are below.
**Ataylor**: We needed to create two different databases with Megan, so that's why we did.
**Ataylor**: But everything is here.
**Adelgado**: Don't work right now.
**Adelgado**: The Bella Canvas Maryland one pops up in like current projects.
**Bclymer**: That.

**Speaker 6**: I was going to.
**Speaker 6**: I don't know what this means because I got an email from I believe item to Katie, the owner and it had a cc'd on it and it.
**Speaker 6**: And it was basically saying here, here's a link to the portal where, where your permit is or something like that.
**Speaker 6**: And then it says it asked for a wet ink signature but I don't know what, I don't know what that's for.

**Ataylor**: I don't know why is the moving.
**Ataylor**: It should go.
**Adelgado**: You don't have to worry about it now.
**Adelgado**: It's just something to look into.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, I'll check it out.
**Ataylor**: I'll put it after this one.
**Ataylor**: Because now the phase for these ones are to do's but the status should be also estimating.
**Ataylor**: Okay, I'll move it.
**Ataylor**: Don't worry.
**Ataylor**: I'll make sure to move.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: This one, this is Andres.
**Ataylor**: This is yours, correct?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: Okay, so how are we doing on this one?
**Ataylor**: Anything to update here?
**Ataylor**: Jesse, you added something proposal sent to Siva.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, we sent that.
**Bclymer**: So on Friday.
**Ataylor**: Okay, so that's estimated.

**Adelgado**: What did I put in here for an update?
**Adelgado**: Yeah, so he met with the client.
**Adelgado**: I haven't had any news.
**Adelgado**: So I marked the breakdown is done and then I.
**Adelgado**: I'll follow up with him here by the end of the week and see where he's at.
**Gducharme**: Awesome.
**Ataylor**: Andres GW slowing.
**Ataylor**: Sloane reroof.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I have sent a mode for good request this week.
**Jdawson**: I will follow up and I hope Wednesday have these.
**Jdawson**: These bits to the subs.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Turner Townhomes.
**Ataylor**: This is Jesse.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, so we had a meeting today, but it got moved till tomorrow.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, with the realtor.
**Bclymer**: And then at some point this week we'll meet with the developer.
**Bclymer**: Andreas is working on just square footage takeoff so we know what they're working with.
**Bclymer**: I've got calls into site sub.
**Bclymer**: I got concrete number, masonry numbers coming tomorrow.
**Bclymer**: And then we'll have our drywall, framing, painting, stucco.
**Bclymer**: Should have those numbers tomorrow.
**Bclymer**: And then we'll just have to fill in the rest of the rest of the scopes once we meet with Regina and know the finishes they she would sell.
**Ataylor**: Awesome.
**Ataylor**: This estimate is still not stuttered.
**Ataylor**: It's in progress.
**Bclymer**: It's in progress.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: Perfect.
**Ataylor**: Goodwill Foundation.
**Ataylor**: This is Andres and Glenn as well.
**Ataylor**: This is Glenn.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So Glenn gave me the abatement bid this morning.
**Bclymer**: I sent that off to Andrew with goodwill and then we just kind of.
**Bclymer**: I went in and just plugged some numbers for all the different things into our estimate and to give Andrew molder idea of the cost.
**Bclymer**: So he's going to talk to Joel, not.
**Bclymer**: Not Joel.
**Bclymer**: Talk to Jared and see if the price is too high, too low, what they Think of it.
**Bclymer**: And then we'll get there.
**Bclymer**: We can finish up the estimate.
**Bclymer**: You know the estimate now though, when you talk to the subs.
**Bclymer**: We know what we're going to abate at this point.
**Bclymer**: So you should be able to finalize like who's going to electrician or drywall guy who's going to cut all the drywall.
**Bclymer**: I think the drywall guy prefers to cut it just so it's cut to where he can patch it back easily.
**Bclymer**: So things like that.
**Bclymer**: Andrew or Andreas and Glenn.
**Bclymer**: We can finish up that estimate now.
**Bclymer**: Should be able to.
**Bclymer**: There's only two things missing.
**Bclymer**: Framing and the electrician and those exterior columns which I think the frame rule is going to do.
**Bclymer**: And then we can wrap that thing up.
**Ataylor**: Okay, sounds good.
