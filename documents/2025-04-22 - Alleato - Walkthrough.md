## Transcript
**Bclymer**: Hi.
**Bclymer**: Brandon in Florida, I see.
**Justin**: Yep.
**Justin**: Driving from a meeting.
**Bclymer**: Okay, nice.
**Bclymer**: How many minutes do you have?
**Justin**: I don't know.
**Justin**: Probably a lot less than you have scheduled.
**Bclymer**: All right, sounds good.
**Bclymer**: So let's get to the point.
**Bclymer**: Oh, we don't have Justin or Fatima yet.
**Justin**: That's okay.
**Justin**: I'm sure that I could answer the questions.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: All right, so since you're driving, let's.
**Bclymer**: Let's talk about this narratively.
**Bclymer**: All right, so for the jobs that we have in 2024, right.
**Bclymer**: We're seeing that the margins are inconsistent.
**Bclymer**: Some margins are showing 90 plus percent, other margins are showing negative.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: And so it's kind of all across the board.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And Brandon, you're still with me.
**Justin**: Yeah, I just.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: And so while we.
**Bclymer**: Obviously we.
**Bclymer**: As we talked and discussed, while we don't necessarily need a 2023 web schedule, obviously we don't have that.
**Bclymer**: We prepare that and everything.
**Bclymer**: We need 24 to be.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And so right now what we're seeing is like, for example, on Ulta Dallas, our revenues are through the roof, but our cost is very minimal, showing like 95% gross margin.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Justin**: I mean, that's because we.
**Justin**: That's because we front loaded.
**Justin**: I mean, that job's still going on.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: And so because we front loaded, some of that cost really should have been in 2024, should have been an asset, if you will, in 23, and should have been a cost in 24.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: And so that's why we wanted to go by each job and see exactly what the story is behind it so that we can fix the 24 schedule.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: And so, Kevin, if you can pull up the WIP on the screen, Brandon's not going to be able to look at numbers right now, but we can talk about each one.
**Bclymer**: All right, so Ulta Dallas is the first one.
**Bclymer**: So we.
**Bclymer**: It looks like we put in a lot of money cost wise in order to get this job going in 23, but we spent minimal in 24.
**Bclymer**: Does that sound right?
**Justin**: Yeah, I mean, so what they did was phase two didn't even, like, was delayed.
**Justin**: It was supposed to start in 24.
**Justin**: They delayed it.
**Justin**: It just started in 25.
**Justin**: So we didn't really do anything in 24.
**Justin**: Like, we had a little bit of, like, welding, but that was it.
**Bclymer**: Okay, that's.
**Bclymer**: This is good.
**Bclymer**: This is good.
**Bclymer**: So in 23 and 24, nothing was really done in terms of construction and services.
**Justin**: Yeah, 23, we had what's.
**Justin**: I mean, it's a phase job.
**Justin**: So 23, we had phase one, which was like the, like the mezzanine and some welding which is kind of just, it's just, it's work done, but it's not as high value as what phase two is, which has both the pick modules and two more mezzanine.
**Justin**: So just, it's just more work.
**Justin**: I front loaded the billings on it all because whenever they said that oh well, old is going to put a pause on it, I went ahead and build everything out ahead so that if they said, oh, we're not going to finish phase two, then I was still going to make a profit.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: But for now we, we only have 150 in billings through the end of 24, whereas our cost is almost 800k.
**Justin**: Yeah, because again, we, we kicked the can down the road because we were doing cash accounting in 23 and so I wanted some cost to hit and offset that.
**Bclymer**: But.
**Justin**: Yes, that's right.
**Justin**: We haven't had much, but we didn't build much in 24 at all because really everything was billing in the rears like the work was finished at the end of 23.
**Justin**: For phase one.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay, how much was phase one in terms of contract?
**Bclymer**: Probably.
**Justin**: Probably contract like what we paid out.
**Bclymer**: How much, how much that client is supposed to pay you for phase one?
**Justin**: I don't know.
**Justin**: My scheduled value is probably around a million bucks.
**Bclymer**: Okay, but you're saying phase one is complete.
**Justin**: Oh, yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so we do have a million.
**Bclymer**: About 900k recognized through today.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Now from looking at 23 to.
**Bclymer**: Compared to 24, how much work percentage wise, highest high level estimate.
**Bclymer**: Did you complete a phase one?
**Bclymer**: In 23?
**Justin**: In 23 we've completed 90% of phase one.
**Bclymer**: In 23.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so in 24, around 10% was.
**Bclymer**: The rest of it was done.
**Bclymer**: For phase one.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, for phase one.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So right now, Fatima, I'm looking at the WIP schedule.
**Bclymer**: The WIP schedule is saying the complete opposite.
**Bclymer**: So we'll need to, we'll need to fix.
**Bclymer**: Fix that.
**Bclymer**: Okay, that's good.
**Bclymer**: And you estimated around a 12 profit on Ulta Dallas just in total?
**Justin**: Yeah, yeah, that's probably about accurate.
**Justin**: And we might get 15.
**Justin**: It depends on what we like.
**Justin**: There's penny change orders and stuff out there, but we'll see.
**Bclymer**: Sure, sure.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, no, I mean ballpark 1215.
**Bclymer**: It's around that.
**Bclymer**: Around that area, right?
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so Fatima, we'll need to, we'll need to fix that for sure because obviously it's out of balance.
**Bclymer**: And so how many more minutes do you got Brandon?
**Bclymer**: I just want to make sure.
**Bclymer**: I'm cognizant of your time.
**Justin**: Yeah, let's just keep rifling through it.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so Crate Escapes is a disaster.
**Bclymer**: I can see that.
**Bclymer**: All right, so tell me more about Crate Escapes.
**Bclymer**: It looks like you frontloaded a lot in 23, but didn't really start in 24.
**Justin**: No, I think you're.
**Justin**: No, it would have.
**Justin**: We didn't build anything until 24.
**Bclymer**: Now forget about billings for a second.
**Bclymer**: Let's just talk about when we started construction and work.
**Justin**: Yeah, that started in, like, May or June of 24.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So is that kind of the same story across Lakeshore and Goodwill?
**Justin**: Which Goodwill?
**Bclymer**: Goodwill Bart.
**Justin**: Goodwill Bart.
**Justin**: Phase one started in.
**Justin**: It would have been, like, August of 24, and then phase two kicked off in, like, January, maybe December 24th.
**Bclymer**: December 24th.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so.
**Bclymer**: All right, let me just do.
**Justin**: Lakeshore would have started May or June.
**Justin**: July of 24, and finished in, like, September 24th.
**Justin**: Yes, September 24th.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So Fatima, kind of the same with these crates.
**Bclymer**: Crate escapes, Lakeshore Goodwill, Bart.
**Bclymer**: None of this really started in.
**Bclymer**: In 23.
**Bclymer**: So any cost that was there in 23, those are all assets cost in excess of billings.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: We never.
**Bclymer**: We never started billing them in 20 until 24.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: I guess.
**Fnjie**: Is there a disconnect?
**Fnjie**: Maybe it's because it's just GNA stuff, and maybe it's not even applied for this job or that's why I'm just kind of curious of why there's activity in 2023.
**Justin**: Yeah, I mean, it very well could.
**Bclymer**: Have just talked a little bit about it.
**Justin**: Could have just, like, it could have just been shifting costs that didn't get coded right in 23, like, to those.
**Justin**: To those things.
**Justin**: That's the only thing I can think of that.
**Justin**: That it would have done, especially if you talk about, like, Lakeshore, you know, because that was such a high margin job.
**Justin**: You know, it's very, very reasonable.
**Justin**: This.
**Justin**: And things would get buried there.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so that's.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: So let me just take one by one again.
**Bclymer**: So freight escapes, obviously a disaster.
**Bclymer**: We're looking at a 2% margin, if anything.
**Justin**: Yeah, I mean, that's it.
**Justin**: Generous.
**Bclymer**: Oh, okay.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: So that we were going to ask you about how you're estimating these costs and how things look like in the pipeline.
**Bclymer**: So the issue.
**Justin**: The issue with that one is, is a project manager just dropped.
**Justin**: Completely dropped the ball.
**Justin**: Made changes that were not approved by the PUD which then we had to go back and change and correct at my dime because he up and.
**Justin**: And so.
**Justin**: And plus he just.
**Justin**: He just did a shitty job.
**Justin**: I mean, there's no way, no way around it.
**Justin**: You just.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, no, it happens.
**Bclymer**: Shit happens.
**Bclymer**: I get it.
**Bclymer**: So when we're looking at trade escapes.
**Bclymer**: Kevin, can you go to the left?
**Bclymer**: All the way to the left.
**Bclymer**: All right, so we had estimated we're going to incur a cost of about 2.5 million.
**Bclymer**: Maybe.
**Bclymer**: Fatima, if you can touch base with Brandon and see where this is all going to land.
**Bclymer**: When all said and done, if we need to revise that estimate, it'll.
**Justin**: It'll be a break even right around there.
**Justin**: Like what.
**Justin**: I mean, I'm.
**Justin**: I'm projecting like at the.
**Justin**: When at the end of the day when we actually apply labor costs and everything to it, it's going to be a, you know, a few percent loss I paid to build their building.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so would you be to cons, on a conservative basis, would you say a 5% loss net?
**Justin**: Yeah, that would be the maximum.
**Justin**: I, I would say it's probably closer to 2, but yeah, 5%.
**Justin**: You could put that just to be safe.
**Bclymer**: So maybe.
**Bclymer**: Fatima, let's, let's, let's get that to be corrected.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, this is really good.
**Bclymer**: So let us know if you, if you think the.
**Bclymer**: These margins are going to be significantly off.
**Bclymer**: Significantly off.
**Bclymer**: It's going to be close.
**Bclymer**: Great.
**Bclymer**: All right, so let's go going back to Lakeshore.
**Bclymer**: What did we pay up front in 23 on Lakeshore?
**Justin**: Nothing.
**Justin**: I mean that job started and ended in 24.
**Bclymer**: Started and ended in 24.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: We still see it in progress on this schedule.
**Justin**: It's not.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so Fatima, let's look into this one.
**Bclymer**: This was a start and finish in 24, which would make it easier because we know how much cost has been incurred since the job is done.
**Mcalcetero**: So what if we have some activity like invoices in 20?
**Justin**: Yeah, the only.
**Justin**: Yeah, yeah, that's, that's just like for instance, like there's a.
**Justin**: There was an ever poor invoice, ever par.
**Justin**: Invoice where they were just very slow to invoice us and I was refusing to pay until they sent us the final invoices.
**Justin**: That's the only reason it would be showing open is if some of those checks hadn't cleared because they finally just sent us the final invoice, whatever, I don't know, maybe a month ago.
**Justin**: So that's maybe why it's showing is open.
**Justin**: But in reality, all the work was done in 24.
**Justin**: It's just the generator company was taking forever to bill us, so there was.
**Bclymer**: An administrative delay on their end, which is.
**Bclymer**: Yes, which is fine.
**Bclymer**: But for Fatima, for purposes of this audit, we need to show it as completely done.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And all revenue should have been recognized in 24, correct?
**Justin**: Yeah, we got fully paid in 24.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: That was.
**Bclymer**: That was Lakeshore.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Ealnaslah**: Sorry.
**Ealnaslah**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Sorry.
**Ealnaslah**: Tim, for the discussion, would you mind if we record the sessions so it will help us to go back and check in in case we miss anything during the discussion?
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Justin**: I should have fireflies on here, right?
**Justin**: Maria, Are they not on the chat?
**Justin**: They usually are.
**Justin**: Yeah, we got fireflies.
**Justin**: Yeah, they're here.
**Justin**: Send it to you.
**Asupit**: Plus yes, they're connected.
**Justin**: Yeah, so we'll send you guys.
**Justin**: Yeah, Maria, make sure you send in the recording, please.
**Asupit**: Okay, I will.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so that's Alta Dallas, crate escapes.
**Bclymer**: Lakeshore.
**Bclymer**: Lakeshore again, started and finished in 24.
**Bclymer**: Goodwill Bart.
**Justin**: Brandon started in, like I said, October.
**Justin**: Phase one.
**Justin**: We should be done Friday.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: October of 24.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Goodwill, Bart, October of 24.
**Bclymer**: So we have.
**Bclymer**: For some reason we have costs in 23.
**Justin**: Yeah, again, we shouldn't.
**Justin**: But I mean, unless stuff just got pushed there because it didn't get coded.
**Justin**: And I probably would just like code the somewhere like, you know, because we had taxes or whatever, we had to close books.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right, so we'll.
**Bclymer**: We'll.
**Bclymer**: Fatima will have to fix that, please.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay.
**Justin**: Cart cold storage, phase one started in October 24th.
**Justin**: Carpool storage, it started in the.
**Justin**: In October of 24.
**Justin**: Phase one did probably like August, September time frame.
**Justin**: We just are finishing up with that phase here.
**Justin**: You know, ideally this month.
**Justin**: We should be getting final invoices and paid either this month or next month.
**Justin**: And then phase two will start.
**Justin**: Well, that's why we need to get this audit done because that's the 10 million dollar phase two that we have.
**Bclymer**: To get our car cold is the Tennessee one.
**Justin**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Okay, understood.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so phase one should be done shortly, you're saying?
**Justin**: Yeah, I mean, it's pretty much done.
**Justin**: I think they had like a couple change orders they added, but it's for all purposes done.
**Justin**: I just.
**Justin**: I think we're waiting on final payment of like 160 or 70,000.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: So it looks like something was just coded to 23, but we really didn't have any costs or anything in 23 for car cold.
**Justin**: Yeah, now that may have been a mistake because we did have another cart Memphis project in 23.
**Justin**: That was a different project.
**Justin**: It would have been called Cart Memphis.
**Justin**: So that could be a clerical error, it sounds like.
**Bclymer**: And we're budgeting around 20% for that one.
**Bclymer**: Is that right?
**Justin**: Including phase two or just phase one?
**Bclymer**: The whole.
**Bclymer**: The whole job.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Justin**: I mean, we'll see.
**Justin**: What I mean.
**Justin**: Because.
**Justin**: Yeah, I mean, it'll probably.
**Justin**: Honestly, it'll probably be less than that because all of this audit and stuff, I'm going to have to go to that job.
**Justin**: And so after $150,000 or whatever this takes, then it'll probably be at 15%.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So, Fatima, let's visit the column S margin there that we're expecting and the cost.
**Bclymer**: All right, excellent.
**Bclymer**: Zion started in 24, so I don't see any issues there, but we're budgeting 63%.
**Bclymer**: Does that sound right?
**Justin**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Oh, those are.
**Bclymer**: Those are small numbers.
**Bclymer**: Anyway.
**Bclymer**: Westfield, we're looking at around 12.
**Bclymer**: Profit.
**Justin**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Started in 24.
**Justin**: Yeah, we incurred some costs.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Justin**: Yeah, because we started some design in 24.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so you did start services in 24?
**Justin**: Yeah, we started the design in 24.
**Justin**: Like, the upfront design probably started in, like, I don't know, November, December, time frame.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: The next couple are quit or small, so I'm going to go through them real quick.
**Bclymer**: Goodwill Bloomington for 24.
**Bclymer**: Then it seemed like there was much going on.
**Justin**: Nope, it's just some upfront design stuff, and it's really just now started kicking off.
**Bclymer**: Okay, perfect.
**Bclymer**: Goodwill Curb or Goodwill Curb.
**Bclymer**: Cat.
**Justin**: Yeah, that's just a small parking lot stop that we were doing as a favor.
**Justin**: There's.
**Justin**: The only cost is a little bit of design stuff and.
**Justin**: And some permanent costs in the 24, 34 sound, right?
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Justin**: Yeah, there's not so much to it.
**Bclymer**: Perfect.
**Bclymer**: Core mark.
**Justin**: 10% core mark.
**Justin**: Which one?
**Bclymer**: Or mark Atlanta?
**Justin**: No, that should have been.
**Justin**: Well, I guess we haven't got the final numbers and everything on that, so it might.
**Justin**: It might finalize.
**Justin**: I was hoping we'd be at 20, but 5, but I know we put.
**Justin**: I put some.
**Justin**: Some cost there, so 10 is probably accurate at the end of the day.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: For the next few, it looks like all of them were basically done by the end of 23, but I'll.
**Bclymer**: I'll let you comment.
**Bclymer**: So Radial M.D.
**Bclymer**: yep.
**Bclymer**: Cooper Road.
**Justin**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Hers and Gers.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Specter Vegas.
**Justin**: I mean, it was done in 23.
**Justin**: It was really done.
**Justin**: Like, I'd say it.
**Justin**: I think our turnover day was like, December 23rd, but they.
**Justin**: We went back and like, they had.
**Justin**: Hey, like, over the next year, they want Us to keep adding stuff.
**Justin**: So we had a little bit of billions and stuff.
**Justin**: Like it maybe equal less than 100 grand in 24.
**Justin**: So for all purposes, the main project was done, and they would just have this little piddly stuff that.
**Justin**: I mean, I was gonna.
**Justin**: I was put 100 margin on it.
**Justin**: So I'm like, if you guys want me to do it, I'll do it, but it's gonna cost you.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right, fair enough.
**Bclymer**: So, yeah, it looks like there was a little bit in the beginning of 24 to do for Spectre.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Cart, Memphis, that was.
**Justin**: Yeah, the first car.
**Justin**: So, yes, that was all in 23.
**Bclymer**: Brennan, Pittsburgh.
**Justin**: Oh, yeah, that.
**Justin**: That one didn't really go through.
**Justin**: But the little stuff that we did do was.
**Justin**: Was 23.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So, Fatima, like we said earlier this morning, I think except Spectre Vegas, a lot of this should be just flush through 23.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: The following were jobs that we started.
**Bclymer**: It looks like started in 23, but you'll.
**Bclymer**: You want to.
**Justin**: You.
**Bclymer**: We want to verify with you.
**Bclymer**: And completed in 24.
**Bclymer**: Zion Prep.
**Justin**: Yeah, I think that.
**Justin**: I'm trying to think when we finished that one, that would have been like March probably.
**Justin**: We finished that 24.
**Justin**: So, yeah, I think I.
**Justin**: I had design costs at the end of 20.
**Justin**: At the end of the year.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: When did you start, though?
**Bclymer**: Did you start in 23?
**Justin**: Well, yeah, the design would have started in 23.
**Justin**: Construction would have been in 24.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Justin**: So, yeah, it's all one project.
**Justin**: So technically, as far as financials go, you know, you could say it started in 23 and ended in 24.
**Bclymer**: Got it.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So, Fatima, same story as maybe create escapes Lakeshore, Goodwill, Cart, Cold.
**Bclymer**: These guys.
**Bclymer**: We had costs in 23, but we didn't really start in 24 until 24.
**Justin**: Correct.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So this.
**Bclymer**: This is probably likely going to be just booked as an.
**Bclymer**: An asset.
**Bclymer**: And most of these costs got to go in 24.
**Bclymer**: Got it.
**Bclymer**: Goodwill, Excel.
**Justin**: Brandon, that was.
**Bclymer**: When did you start?
**Justin**: We didn't start that one until.
**Justin**: That was all 24.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Justin**: Starting in 24.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Justin**: So because we started like into February or beginning of March, something like that, it got done right around school time.
**Bclymer**: Got it.
**Bclymer**: Wesleyan office.
**Justin**: Same thing.
**Justin**: It's all 24.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: All right, so a lot of these are going to be assets.
**Bclymer**: Fatima, for 23 and then.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Cost in 24.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: This is really good.
**Bclymer**: Thank you.
**Bclymer**: Let's go.
**Bclymer**: We got a few more left.
**Bclymer**: Core Mark, which one doesn't say.
**Justin**: What's the.
**Justin**: What's the number.
**Bclymer**: Revenue go to the left, Kevin.
**Bclymer**: Total contract at least was 305.
**Justin**: That was revenue.
**Bclymer**: That's total contract.
**Bclymer**: Total revenue was around the same.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Justin**: Yeah, that's Cormark, Oklahoma City.
**Mcalcetero**: So that would have been job number 24107.
**Justin**: Yeah, that's that.
**Justin**: Yeah, that's OKC.
**Justin**: So that's.
**Justin**: That was all done in 24.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: When did you start?
**Justin**: Everything started in 24.
**Justin**: We might have done some design in the end of 23, but I pretty sure everything started and finished in 24.
**Justin**: I know.
**Justin**: Construction wise, it did.
**Justin**: I don't even think design started until 24.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, Fatima, we gotta look at this one too because we're recognizing all the revenue in 23.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And this one's out of balance as well.
**Bclymer**: So this, this likely so.
**Bclymer**: Sorry, say that again, Brandon.
**Bclymer**: So you started and finished in 24.
**Justin**: Yeah, yeah.
**Justin**: Because if it's got a 24 code, 24, 107.
**Justin**: It's definitely a 24.
**Justin**: All 24 jobs.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right, that's interesting.
**Bclymer**: That's interesting because this one and seven.
**Bclymer**: Memphis, Memphis, Siva Memphis have all of the revenue going in 23.
**Justin**: Siva Memphis would be 23.
**Justin**: It's 23 something.
**Justin**: Right.
**Justin**: Code.
**Bclymer**: Oh, you're right.
**Bclymer**: Sorry, yeah, 23, 102.
**Bclymer**: You're right.
**Justin**: Yeah, it's all 23.
**Bclymer**: So that started and finished in 23.
**Justin**: Yep.
**Justin**: It.
**Justin**: Technically, I think I started doing design at 22 or something like that.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Justin**: So no, I, Yeah, it started in 23.
**Justin**: God, I'm losing track of my ears.
**Justin**: What year did I go to, Tony?
**Justin**: Yeah, I started in 23 and I, I know we finished on 23.
**Justin**: We might have had some billing stuff because there was like an insurance claim that, that drug it out into 24.
**Justin**: But I think we, we even got all that settled in the whole year.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Pretty sure right now for some reason we have costs spilling into 24.
**Justin**: Yeah, that's where.
**Justin**: So again, like we had.
**Justin**: There was the insurance damage claim.
**Justin**: So I basically I had to pay out some damage and then I got paid by the sub back for that.
**Justin**: So that's that cost at maybe $173,000.
**Justin**: That spilled over, but that's about it.
**Bclymer**: Got it.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And that was, that was, that was subcontractor's fault.
**Justin**: Yeah, yeah.
**Justin**: So basically I paid Siva and the sub paid me.
**Bclymer**: Got it.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, those are the two.
**Bclymer**: Which ones?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, Core Mark and Siva are the ones that all the revenue was recognized in 23.
**Bclymer**: But we had some additional costs because of these probably insurance issues in 24, which caused us to have this cost.
**Bclymer**: But at the end of the day, for all intensive purposes, you guys, before this insurance issue came up, you guys were essentially done in 23.
**Justin**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah.
**Mcalcetero**: Just a note on.
**Mcalcetero**: On Callmark.
**Mcalcetero**: That was a mistake on my end.
**Mcalcetero**: It was billed in 25, not 23.
**Justin**: Well, there's a different.
**Justin**: There's a different.
**Justin**: There's another core mark.
**Justin**: So there's, there's core mark, Georgia.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Justin**: Which is what, what you're billing.
**Justin**: What's built now, the one that we just finished.
**Justin**: And there's Cormar, that was SLC Core Mark, Salt Lake City, which was in 24.
**Mcalcetero**: Do you know the job number for the core mark in Georgia?
**Justin**: 101, maybe.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Mcalcetero**: 25101.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay.
**Mcalcetero**: That right there.
**Justin**: I think I, I, I something.
**Justin**: I think it's 25101.
**Justin**: Yeah, that's it.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And then Cormar, 24107.
**Bclymer**: That, that's salt Lake City.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: All right, perfect.
**Bclymer**: We talked about seven Memphis and Radial Avion.
**Justin**: That would have started in beginning of 24, January 24, and finished same year.
**Bclymer**: Construction services, all that started in 24.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Interesting.
**Bclymer**: We had Billings.
**Justin**: What's the, what's the job number?
**Bclymer**: 23106.
**Justin**: Okay, then I'm sorry, it started in January of 23.
**Justin**: I tried to go off memory, but whatever the job number is, if you tell me the job number, I can tell you exactly what it is.
**Justin**: So it started right at the beginning of 23 and finished in 23.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Started and finished in 23.
**Bclymer**: Correct.
**Justin**: That one.
**Bclymer**: That one's an interesting one.
**Bclymer**: So let's, let's take note of that.
**Bclymer**: And Fatima, let's look into that.
**Justin**: Are you having, Are you showing some of it starting in 22?
**Justin**: Man?
**Bclymer**: No, we're, we're seeing, it's, we're seeing revenue and cost in 23 and 24.
**Justin**: Cost.
**Justin**: Do you see cost in 24?
**Justin**: Yeah, I think what that was is.
**Justin**: So when we went to pull a permit for Crate Escapes, there was like a little bill, like a $2,000 bill that where whenever we transfer the electric account over to Radial, there was a gap and they didn't pay it and we didn't.
**Justin**: So it's sitting there.
**Justin**: So Duke made us pay that to get our.
**Justin**: To be able to open an account for Crate Escapes.
**Bclymer**: That's, I mean, the cost is really minimal.
**Bclymer**: But if we're saying it started and finished essentially in 23, then Fatima, all of this should be in 23.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Especially since it's a 23106 code.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: 23 111.
**Bclymer**: Cart Hebron.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Justin**: Ohio.
**Justin**: That would have been finished same year, I believe.
**Bclymer**: Started and finished in 23.
**Justin**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Nothing was in 24.
**Bclymer**: No services, no construction, nothing.
**Justin**: Some costs may have bled over, but pretty sure we were done by the end of the year.
**Bclymer**: Right, but you guys packed up and you guys went home by the end of the year of 23?
**Justin**: Yep.
**Fnjie**: Quick question.
**Fnjie**: When you say costs spilled over, is it cost that occurred during the year and then after that you just got the invoice later on, let's say, like a month later or.
**Justin**: Correct.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Justin**: So it just.
**Justin**: It just for whatever.
**Justin**: Like, so either retainage or, like, just a vendor, you know, the build that I don't bill is for 30 days and blah, blah, blah.
**Bclymer**: So, like.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: So it sounds like we might have cut off where a Fatima might have to look at year end 2024, to see if there's any invoices that spilled over from 2025 that applies to 2024.
**Fnjie**: So it seems like we have a cutoff, I guess, item that we have to resolve.
**Fnjie**: And then you did mention something about retainage we didn't really see retain.
**Fnjie**: Correct me if I'm wrong, Kevin, Was there any, like, retainage account from, like, is it.
**Justin**: No retainage?
**Justin**: It's all ap.
**Justin**: There's some.
**Justin**: Some owners hold retainage on us.
**Fnjie**: Correct.
**Justin**: It's rare.
**Justin**: But you're probably just.
**Justin**: Because the way our accounting system will show it is it shows that retainage is essentially money gone and paid out.
**Justin**: That's the only thing I can think of.
**Justin**: Like.
**Mcalcetero**: It'S not included in the ap.
**Mcalcetero**: There's no AP retainage.
**Mcalcetero**: Gl.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: But it's included in the AP though.
**Fnjie**: Right.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Ealnaslah**: All right, Then do we.
**Ealnaslah**: Do we have the retainers for AR as well, Fatima?
**Bclymer**: No, no, I think.
**Bclymer**: Brandon.
**Justin**: There's no.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Justin**: So, yeah, it's rare that clients hold retainage on us.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Cart Hebron is all started and completed in 23.
**Bclymer**: So same issue.
**Bclymer**: Fatima there.
**Bclymer**: Macomb Group, Indianapolis, 23, 113.
**Justin**: Yeah, that started.
**Justin**: It started at the end of 23 with design, but finished in 24 or.
**Justin**: Yeah, I would have finished in.
**Justin**: In the beginning of 24.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So, I mean, you guys basically started and finished in 24.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Justin**: There wasn't.
**Justin**: I mean, again, maybe some design costs, but not much.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: So this one looks fine.
**Bclymer**: Four zone.
**Justin**: That would have been 24 through and through.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: That looks right as well.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right, excellent.
**Bclymer**: Any questions, team, on these different jobs, before we go into our walkthrough, what.
**Mcalcetero**: About the, the comprom?
**Mcalcetero**: Was that a part of any job?
**Bclymer**: Which one?
**Justin**: Would you say that again?
**Mcalcetero**: You broke up Comp Pro.
**Mcalcetero**: It seems like it was a PO.
**Mcalcetero**: It wasn't related to anything.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Ealnaslah**: Which has $15,000.
**Justin**: What is it?
**Justin**: Pro.
**Justin**: What?
**Mcalcetero**: Pump Pro- McComb.
**Mcalcetero**: There was $15,000 billed in 2024.
**Justin**: Oh, that's maybe an insurance thing.
**Justin**: I think they had like a break in or something.
**Mcalcetero**: What job was that related to?
**Mcalcetero**: Do you know.
**Justin**: Was it by itself from McComb?
**Justin**: It would have been the same bill.
**Justin**: It would have been that same building.
**Bclymer**: So is it, I think what Fatima is asking, is it, is it related to Macomb Group?
**Bclymer**: Indianapolis?
**Justin**: Yeah, yeah, Same building, same ownership.
**Justin**: Yeah, I think we just had to do the landlord or something.
**Bclymer**: So Fatima, do you want to include that and then the code?
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, that will include it.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: So what I, what I'll need.
**Bclymer**: What I'll need you guys to do, Fatima and Brandon is Fatima, once you go through and update these for, you know, what actually happened when services started, etc, then Brandon, I need you to look at this and, and, and bless it for us because we're going to use this and we're going to, we're going to assume it's correct as we go through and test it.
**Justin**: Okay?
**Bclymer**: All right, so super important.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: How many more minutes do you have?
**Justin**: Let's just keep rifling through it.
**Justin**: I'm sitting in traffic.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right, so let's go through our walkthrough questions.
**Bclymer**: So as the team prepares those.
**Bclymer**: Brandon, give us a high level of what you do.
**Bclymer**: And I don't know if you do this with Jesse or somebody else, but how you budget out your jobs.
**Bclymer**: Just give us the high level.
**Bclymer**: What do you do to get as accurate as possible estimate?
**Justin**: So the client tells us what they want done.
**Justin**: We define the scope into different trades.
**Justin**: And then from there we go out and get numbers from subcontractors for how much it costs to do said work.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so you gather subcontractor estimates.
**Bclymer**: What about like materials and all that stuff?
**Justin**: There's a little they pro.
**Justin**: They.
**Justin**: They buy their, their own material.
**Justin**: So when they give us a number, it's a furnishing install.
**Bclymer**: Oh, okay.
**Bclymer**: I think we see, I see costs of materials on our, on our piano.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Justin**: So you'll see that a lot on crate escapes because that project manager thought he could save money and go buy.
**Justin**: And then would be missing.
**Justin**: And that's why that job's losing money.
**Bclymer**: So most of that material is related to crates.
**Justin**: Correct.
**Justin**: And that was a.
**Justin**: You know, we got a nice talking to about how stupid that is.
**Bclymer**: And that hopefully is a one off issue.
**Justin**: Oh, it'll never happen again.
**Justin**: I'm not.
**Justin**: I'll be out of business if I pay to build people's buildings.
**Bclymer**: Understood.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: So you go out, you, hey, subcontractor, give us your estimate, give us your quote, etc.
**Bclymer**: You gather all of that and you put together your estimate plus the markup.
**Justin**: Correct.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right, let's go into the specifics.
**Bclymer**: Go ahead.
**Bclymer**: Adrian or Kevin, whoever's.
**Bclymer**: Let's just do.
**Bclymer**: Let's just start with the revenue and the contract stuff.
**Bclymer**: We'll do the rest later.
**Bclymer**: Or if you want to start from the top, go ahead.
**Evliao**: You.
**Bclymer**: Both of you guys are muted.
**Ealnaslah**: Oh, okay.
**Ealnaslah**: So this is the first question for the cash resist process.
**Ealnaslah**: So who is the responsible for the initiating, the initiating and the sending the customer invoice in each month?
**Bclymer**: That's the project manager.
**Ealnaslah**: That's the project manager.
**Ealnaslah**: And then are invoices reviewed or approved before being sent to the clients by CEO?
**Ealnaslah**: Okay, so do we approve this invoice by email or do we have like particular way to approve that?
**Justin**: I just open it up and look at it.
**Justin**: And didn't just say good to go.
**Justin**: You know, it's.
**Justin**: They all sit in the file.
**Justin**: Like they all sit in the job files.
**Justin**: We're not a big enough company.
**Justin**: Like, I just yell at the office next to me.
**Ealnaslah**: Okay.
**Ealnaslah**: Okay.
**Ealnaslah**: We checked this invoice through that procore, right?
**Justin**: Yes, procore.
**Justin**: And now we're switching to job planner.
**Justin**: But job.
**Ealnaslah**: Okay, got it.
**Ealnaslah**: So is there a segregation of the duties between the person who received the payments and the ones who perform the bank reconciliation?
**Ealnaslah**: I guess bank reconciliation should be performed by our accountants from the Philippines, Right?
**Justin**: What was the question exactly?
**Justin**: Are you asking?
**Justin**: There's a difference between the person who receives.
**Ealnaslah**: Yeah.
**Justin**: Payment versus the person who reconciles it.
**Ealnaslah**: Yes.
**Justin**: Yeah, I receive the payment and accounting reconciles it.
**Ealnaslah**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Hey, Justin just joined.
**Bclymer**: How you doing, Justin?
**Evliao**: I'm good.
**Evliao**: Sorry about that.
**Evliao**: I saw Maria's email that we're doing it tomorrow and then I saw that you guys joined this.
**Evliao**: I got a read notification so I jumped right in.
**Bclymer**: So no worries.
**Bclymer**: We're.
**Bclymer**: We just want to get this done as soon as practical.
**Bclymer**: Thank you for joining.
**Bclymer**: So just.
**Bclymer**: We just went over the whip schedule with Brandon by job.
**Bclymer**: By by line.
**Bclymer**: And so he gave us a little bit more color and background on when things actually started and when things actually ended.
**Bclymer**: So Fatima is going to be revising the 24 Whip schedule to reflect that, running any adjustments through whether.
**Bclymer**: Whether it's 23 or 24.
**Bclymer**: She's going to share that with Brandon.
**Bclymer**: When she's all done.
**Bclymer**: Brandon's going to say yep, this looks good.
**Bclymer**: Before we start on it.
**Bclymer**: Makes sense.
**Evliao**: Okay.
**Evliao**: Yep, makes sense.
**Evliao**: Great.
**Bclymer**: Perfect.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: Sorry Kevin.
**Bclymer**: Let's keep going.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Ealnaslah**: So a question for us.
**Ealnaslah**: Are there controls?
**Ealnaslah**: Controls to verify that cash receipts applied in the acumatica match actual bank deposits.
**Justin**: We don't take cash.
**Bclymer**: There's no cash.
**Bclymer**: So I'll check.
**Ealnaslah**: It's all cash.
**Ealnaslah**: Okay, so what controls are in place to detect and prevent intercepted deposits or manual posting errors or non issue noted.
**Ealnaslah**: As of now.
**Justin**: The money is deposited directly into my account or it's a written check.
**Justin**: So as far as if there's an interception, it's on the bank side of things and Chase has their own shit for that.
**Fnjie**: And then one thing to add to that.
**Fnjie**: Who has direct access to your banks?
**Fnjie**: Is it just you?
**Justin**: Just me.
**Bclymer**: All right, next.
**Ealnaslah**: Yep.
**Ealnaslah**: So are there any independent reviews or exceptions reports generated to the.
**Ealnaslah**: I guess this is just Brandon.
**Evliao**: No.
**Evliao**: Right.
**Ealnaslah**: Okay.
**Evliao**: Of cash entries, there is no cache, so.
**Ealnaslah**: Okay, no cache.
**Bclymer**: And the second one?
**Bclymer**: No cache.
**Bclymer**: Kevin.
**Ealnaslah**: It's just no cache.
**Ealnaslah**: Yeah.
**Evliao**: Okay, Brandon, we're stating this.
**Evliao**: You haven't deposited cash into the bank account right before from a client or anything?
**Justin**: No, we've never been paid cash, Leslie.
**Ealnaslah**: So the next questions are more like how do we.
**Ealnaslah**: How do we accept this contract?
**Justin**: All right, so here, I'll just, I'll explain it to you.
**Justin**: All right, listen.
**Justin**: So how does the company receive evaluate bid invitation?
**Justin**: So we work basically off referral.
**Justin**: We don't do bid invitations.
**Justin**: Ours are negotiated jobs.
**Justin**: So a company says, hey, I want to build a building.
**Justin**: My budget's $10 million and we're going to design to that budget.
**Justin**: Okay, who prepares the project cost estimate.
**Justin**: So that's going to be a team.
**Justin**: So it'll include myself, the vp, Jesse.
**Justin**: You know the depends on the big.
**Justin**: You know how big the jobs are.
**Justin**: Smaller ti job, a PM might prepare it and then they're going to give it to me or Jesse to review.
**Justin**: How is the final pricing or proposal reviewed and approved prior to client submission?
**Justin**: I look at every single one who typically identifies the need for CO and how is this communicated?
**Justin**: So that's what we pay project managers to Do.
**Justin**: So if a client says I want to add a second story, that would be a change order.
**Justin**: If for some reason, oh hey, we forgot, you know, to add money for this sidewalk at the cost, that's something that is on us and we'll eat that.
**Justin**: Who's responsible for entering change orders in Procore?
**Justin**: PM was approval workflow for change orders in procore.
**Justin**: I'm assuming you mean for the owner.
**Justin**: Then that would be what's called a pco.
**Justin**: Potential change order is submitted to the owner and you know an OAC, which is a weekly owner, architect, contractors, meeting owner says yep, that's good.
**Justin**: And then it gets applied to a prime contract change order which is then billed in whatever month we do that work.
**Justin**: Is there periodic process to Sync Pro Core CEOs with accounting?
**Justin**: It automatically syncs as they're put in.
**Justin**: Who's responsible for calculating or reviewing the percentage of completion and revenue recognized each month?
**Justin**: Is there documented review and sign off.
**Justin**: So the revenue percentage.
**Justin**: So the billing is done based off of completion.
**Justin**: So you know, the subs will bill us and then you know, we look at make sure that their, their numbers are correct based off of what they've done.
**Justin**: And then our, you know, PM is billing based off of progress.
**Justin**: So like we're 30% done of with concrete.
**Justin**: We're going to build 30% of our schedule values for concrete.
**Justin**: And then every month all the PM's submit was called a PSR Project Status Report to Jesse and myself and we review to look at everything, make sure that nothing's upside down, we're cash flow positive on all the jobs.
**Justin**: Who sends the bill to the customer?
**Justin**: Is it by sent by email?
**Justin**: Yes, it's sent by email.
**Justin**: It kind of depends on the job and the relationship.
**Justin**: Usually a lot of times it's the project manager and they'll cc myself and Jesse on it.
**Justin**: Some jobs I'll send it just because it's a relationship thing.
**Justin**: How do you verify that billing aligns with field progress?
**Justin**: I already told you that.
**Justin**: How are subcontractor costs tracked and marked progress invoices?
**Justin**: Our subcontractor cost tracked and matched to progress.
**Justin**: If invoices are delayed again, we bill based.
**Justin**: I don't care if my subs don't bill me that month.
**Justin**: If we've done the work, I'm billing for it and then I'll just take that money, stick it into a money market account to make a little bit and then when they bill me next month I'll pay them.
**Justin**: Are the original budgets locked after approval can be Modify them during the project.
**Justin**: No, they're locked.
**Justin**: Unless they're synced, they can't be unlocked.
**Justin**: How do you monitor differences between estimated actual billing?
**Justin**: We have an over underlying item that goes in so you have your original budget and then your cost of date and it'll tell you if you're over under the budget is your oversight.
**Justin**: Client calls PSR review documented.
**Justin**: Can you provide sample reports or notes?
**Justin**: All of our calls have no Fireflies note takers in them.
**Justin**: So I mean that's the oversight.
**Justin**: If, if I can't make it to a meeting my fireflies guys there and I can look at it at the end of the day, you know, we can't micromanage everybody.
**Justin**: There's a reason that, I mean look at create escapes.
**Justin**: That's why it's fucked up.
**Justin**: You know, people make mistakes.
**Justin**: We're human.
**Justin**: You have to learn from it and grow.
**Justin**: How do you monitor discrepancy between PSR and actual results?
**Justin**: Like gross margin erosion?
**Justin**: Part of the PSR has got the actual data, you know, from the actual program.
**Justin**: So they'll fill out all the information.
**Justin**: It's really.
**Justin**: Then you go down two pages and I can see the budget and it says here's the actual cost and if it doesn't match then I'll ask them what the hell they're doing.
**Justin**: Yeah, PSR also every month it'll show the gain or loss of fee as that fluctuates.
**Justin**: What is process for the final drive?
**Justin**: Closeout, rec style, total bill first total earned.
**Justin**: I mean that's not really, that's going to be billed concurrently.
**Justin**: That's not really a process.
**Justin**: That's just normal billing.
**Fnjie**: So it sounds like Brandon, you do kind of like a very high level monthly review.
**Fnjie**: Is that true?
**Fnjie**: Yes, like frequency.
**Fnjie**: Could we just get a package example of what your I guess project managers provides you in that monthly basis any month will do just so we can kind of see that process.
**Justin**: Maria, jump into Goodwill, Bart and grab the PSRs, the latest PSR from that job and shoot it to him please.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Justin**: Next question.
**Bclymer**: Looks like that was.
**Bclymer**: Those were the main ones.
**Bclymer**: That was really good.
**Bclymer**: What else we got Team.
**Ealnaslah**: Few open items.
**Bclymer**: We talked about with Fatima this morning.
**Evliao**: Yeah, yeah, Maria knows about those.
**Evliao**: The sock one report that you're requesting from your old payroll provider.
**Justin**: Brandon, I, I sent you guys the expense that, that, that spreadsheet.
**Justin**: Did nobody get it or are we.
**Bclymer**: Talking about the stock report number four?
**Justin**: Oh, stock One report from payroll provided.
**Justin**: What is that?
**Justin**: Maria, do you know what they're talking about?
**Evliao**: You're muted, Maria.
**Evliao**: Yeah, it's the.
**Evliao**: It's the SOC1 report from your prior payroll provider.
**Evliao**: I think Maria's working on that.
**Evliao**: Right, Maria?
**Justin**: For the what, 2024?
**Evliao**: Yeah, the SOC1 report.
**Justin**: 2024.
**Justin**: 2025.
**Bclymer**: 4.
**Bclymer**: Everything is 24.
**Justin**: Okay, yeah, well, we'll get it from Worksmart.
**Justin**: So Maria, just send an email to Worksmart from my email asking them for the SOC one.
**Justin**: 2024.
**Asupit**: Yeah, I think.
**Asupit**: I think they send you something.
**Asupit**: I'll check it out and then explain it to you.
**Bclymer**: All right, thanks.
**Evliao**: And then the expense flux, Brandon, I think they need more on that on top of the email you sent them.
**Bclymer**: Right?
**Evliao**: Yeah, I'll let you talk through that.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, There was just a couple specific expenses we wanted to look at, Brandon.
**Bclymer**: We just wanted to see why things changed up or down during 24 compared to 23.
**Justin**: So, I mean, you know, education is.
**Justin**: I mean, that's just more like I go to Tony Robbins, I go to Strategic Coach, I go to different conferences.
**Justin**: Like, all that stuff gets put in education, travel.
**Justin**: I mean, as we grow, like, we.
**Justin**: More people travel, we have more guys, like, so car rentals, flights, hotels, like, all that stuff goes into travel.
**Justin**: So instead, you know, in 23, we had three people.
**Justin**: At 24, we had 10.
**Justin**: So that expense goes up.
**Evliao**: It went down, Brandon.
**Justin**: It's probably just not all captured.
**Justin**: I mean, it's probably.
**Bclymer**: What.
**Bclymer**: What was that?
**Justin**: It's probably just not.
**Justin**: Not all captured yet from 24, I would imagine, like, or maybe it did go down and we just did better.
**Justin**: But I doubt.
**Bclymer**: Could be.
**Fnjie**: Might be maybe included in some of the costs.
**Fnjie**: Erroneously or correctly, maybe.
**Evliao**: But you want to look at the trial.
**Evliao**: You want to look at the.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, I.
**Mcalcetero**: I think some items got job coded and some didn't.
**Justin**: Oh, oh.
**Justin**: So that you're saying when you say travel, Fatima, that's not the travel cost code.
**Mcalcetero**: This is.
**Mcalcetero**: This is the overhead.
**Justin**: Oh.
**Justin**: Oh, yeah.
**Justin**: Oh, that's.
**Justin**: Oh.
**Mcalcetero**: The reason amongst the jobs.
**Bclymer**: Right, okay.
**Justin**: Yeah, yeah.
**Justin**: The reason it went down is because I got anal and said everything needs to be coded to jobs for travel.
**Justin**: Before, it was just getting coded to overhead and I couldn't job cost correctly.
**Justin**: So.
**Justin**: So the reason that stuff's changed is because I'm trying to get really, really like guys be like, no, everything should be coded to jobs.
**Evliao**: Cool.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I thought this was any of this.
**Bclymer**: So should any of this 186k and travel in 24, should it be in.
**Bclymer**: In cost of goods sold somewhere?
**Justin**: It.
**Justin**: It should.
**Justin**: I mean, I.
**Justin**: I'D have to look at what all and.
**Justin**: And tails in that.
**Justin**: I mean, there's.
**Justin**: Obviously there's a chance some of it is, but then some of my.
**Justin**: My stuff, like I'll travel and I'll kick it to overhead.
**Justin**: Like so, I mean, possibly, but I had to go look at every single transaction and be like, oh, wait, no, that was actually a flight for XYZ job.
**Justin**: Like, you know, is.
**Justin**: I guess my question is, like, if we leave it where it is, is that going to prevent us from getting a license?
**Bclymer**: No, we just want to make sure your gross margin is.
**Bclymer**: Is correct.
**Justin**: Yeah, I mean, I'm fine with leaving it there.
**Justin**: And if it makes our gross margin look less, then I don't care, to be honest, unless it.
**Justin**: Unless it prevents me from getting the license.
**Justin**: I really don't care.
**Justin**: Like, that's all I got.
**Justin**: I could care less.
**Bclymer**: Let me ask it.
**Bclymer**: Let me ask the question in a different way.
**Bclymer**: The 186k, you obviously don't have all the detail in front of you, but would you say most of it is related to jobs or is most of it related to you going to a conference?
**Justin**: I'd say a lot of it's probably.
**Bclymer**: Related to me traveling for job purposes or for.
**Justin**: For.
**Justin**: For conferences, job purses, you know, me flying to wherever.
**Evliao**: Business development.
**Justin**: Business development.
**Justin**: Yeah, whatever.
**Justin**: Like, I.
**Justin**: That number doesn't shock me.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so it's probably is not.
**Bclymer**: Most of it is not related to a specific job site that you actually have to visit.
**Justin**: Correct.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so it's fine wherever where it is.
**Bclymer**: That's good.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: Same thing with.
**Bclymer**: With education.
**Bclymer**: You went to a lot more in 24 than to 20 compared to 23.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: That's the only one on here that I see that actually increased.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Shop supplies, Nothing.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, but 89k and 23.
**Justin**: Yeah, I mean, we bought.
**Justin**: We buy vehicles, supplies.
**Justin**: Like I just.
**Justin**: We started acquiring more stuff as needed.
**Justin**: Like just more people, more things.
**Evliao**: Hold on, Brandon.
**Evliao**: Fatima, can you look at the shop supplies in 23 GL and see what was being coded there?
**Evliao**: That's probably something being coded elsewhere now.
**Evliao**: And we're not using the shop supplies GL in 24 before we were even here.
**Evliao**: So we can look at that AOD and let you know on that one.
**Bclymer**: Sure.
**Bclymer**: No worries.
**Evliao**: Or.
**Evliao**: Or I.
**Evliao**: What I assume happened here, which is probably going to be right, is that we started properly cost coding in 24 and those shop supplies actually probably had some job allocations to them and they were properly allocated in 24.
**Evliao**: But Fatima can you confirm that?
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, yeah, that's what happened.
**Mcalcetero**: When we coded a lot of the credit cards, we were hitting the cost of goods sold instead of just the overhead for the job related items.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So it's just expenses were there probably or just reclassed or put in a different section of the P and L.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**Evliao**: Plum was basically hired, but because like we are trying.
**Evliao**: Well, Brandon's trying to legitimize the businesses proper capture of job costing and gross profit.
**Evliao**: And in 23, what it seems like was being done is there was less emphasis on that.
**Evliao**: So they would put something on their shop supplies that was job related that shouldn't be on your shop supplies.
**Evliao**: So effective in 24, we just have more stringent controls on job costing and especially in 25.
**Evliao**: So that's the, that's the story on, on the, on those items.
**Fnjie**: Okay, same thing with depreciation though.
**Fnjie**: Is it, is it because of vehicles that you're using for the job now it's being reclassed to the actual jobs or what is the depreciation related to?
**Mcalcetero**: For some reason there were a lot of depreciation.
**Mcalcetero**: There was a lot of items in depreciation in prior years that should not have been there.
**Mcalcetero**: So we just made sure that the proper items got allocated there in, in 2024.
**Mcalcetero**: And yeah, those, those were trucks.
**Mcalcetero**: One, one vehicle, I believe.
**Evliao**: Okay, well, remember, remember guys, in 23, I'm assuming due to cash basis filings that they accelerated the depreciation of that item.
**Evliao**: And it was a car in 2013, in 24, probably we didn't purchase a car.
**Evliao**: So that's, that's probably where the discrepancy happened here in the books between 23 and 24.
**Evliao**: Does that make sense?
**Bclymer**: And that's fine.
**Bclymer**: So do we need to, do we need to put.
**Bclymer**: Let's see, I'm looking at 23.
**Bclymer**: Oh, it's fully depreciated in 23.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**Fnjie**: So that's what he's trying to say.
**Fnjie**: I think he bought a new vehicle in 2024 and then the accelerated depreciation.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so if we fully depreciated that in 23, we should, we should probably depreciate it over whatever five years for financial statement and gap purposes.
**Justin**: So we bought.
**Justin**: Yeah, we bought, we bought 1 in 23.
**Justin**: And I think 2 and 24.
**Bclymer**: 1 and 23 and 2 and 4.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Fnjie**: So footnote, footnote disclosure.
**Fnjie**: We need to correct for it based on the useful life.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I don't, I don't know if Justin or Fatima, you guys can put together a schedule with, like, proper useful life.
**Justin**: We can't.
**Justin**: We can't do a 101 set.
**Justin**: What is it, like 179D accelerating.
**Bclymer**: So 179.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Evliao**: You can do it for tax purposes, Brandon.
**Evliao**: Yeah, but when we're looking at, like, a gap accrual financial, which is what we're submitting for, AI to do an audit.
**Evliao**: AI, you just want an.
**Evliao**: You just want a schedule showing what was purchased, its useful life, and what the depreciation would be in 23 and 24 based on that.
**Evliao**: Is that good?
**Evliao**: If we send that to you?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And if it's, you know, if it's big, if it's a big enough difference, then we'll probably have to book the adjustment in 24 or 23.
**Evliao**: Okay.
**Evliao**: Fatima, can we get a schedule for him on that for those three vehicles, 2 and 24?
**Evliao**: 1 and 23.
**Evliao**: And then aad you let us know if you want us just to make a year end 24, adjusting entry to depreciation or whatever you want.
**Bclymer**: Okay?
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Sounds good.
**Bclymer**: Excellent.
**Bclymer**: What else?
**Bclymer**: Guys, this is good.
**Bclymer**: Do we have any leases?
**Bclymer**: Brandon?
**Justin**: Any vehicle leases?
**Bclymer**: No.
**Bclymer**: Office leases?
**Justin**: Yeah, we.
**Justin**: We lease our office in Indy, and we just are gonna be leasing a new off.
**Justin**: New place starting on May 1st in St.
**Justin**: Pete.
**Evliao**: And 24.
**Evliao**: Brendan.
**Justin**: 24 released.
**Justin**: I mean, we started leasing that office in Indianapolis, and it would have been 23.
**Bclymer**: And how long does that lease go for?
**Justin**: How much do we pay a month in that lease?
**Bclymer**: No, no.
**Bclymer**: How long is it?
**Evliao**: The term?
**Bclymer**: The term?
**Justin**: Oh, it's 60 months starting.
**Justin**: And it would have been started like August of 23, I think.
**Bclymer**: Oh, wow.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And the reason why we asked for that is.
**Bclymer**: So, Justin, Fatima, using accounting terms, there should technically be that asset and liability for leases on the balance sheet.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Fnjie**: Under AAC842.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: I don't know if there's any options to extend.
**Justin**: I don't.
**Justin**: I don't know.
**Justin**: I'd have to.
**Justin**: We probably have an option to extend for a few years, but I don't know.
**Justin**: I'm not worried about it.
**Justin**: I mean, nobody's moving into this place.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, that's fine.
**Bclymer**: We can just.
**Bclymer**: So Brandon doesn't.
**Bclymer**: For now.
**Bclymer**: You're not intending to renew, right?
**Justin**: Correct.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So let's just keep it simple, Adrian, and say it's just a 60 months, and then.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: If we can get the one for May20, 25 again, just for subsequent event disclosure purposes.
**Bclymer**: We're not going to do anything with it.
**Bclymer**: We're just gonna disclose that the company entered into a new lease subsequently.
**Justin**: Yeah, Maria, S.
**Justin**: You need the lease?
**Justin**: Maria can send it to you.
**Asupit**: I need both leases for the.
**Asupit**: For the 2025.
**Justin**: Yeah, for the one that we just signed for St.
**Justin**: Pete.
**Justin**: Sending that.
**Asupit**: Yeah, I can send them to.
**Justin**: I'll try to find the least.
**Justin**: I'll try to find the original one.
**Asupit**: From finding the Nepalese one, and I can send the Florida one.
**Mcalcetero**: Maria, can you CCS when you send it, please?
**Asupit**: Of course.
**Asupit**: Thank you.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, we'll see.
**Bclymer**: We'll see if it's big enough to record an adjustment on the balance sheet or.
**Bclymer**: Or.
**Justin**: I don't know.
**Bclymer**: How much are we paying per month on the.
**Bclymer**: On the Indie Pro Indie Office.
**Justin**: Like 22,000, 2100, something like that?
**Bclymer**: 2100 or 21,000.
**Justin**: 2100 per month?
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So it's going to be around 126k for the whole five years.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Maybe we can pass on it.
**Bclymer**: We'll see.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, send it over, please.
**Bclymer**: Excellent.
**Bclymer**: What else we got?
**Ealnaslah**: That will be all.
**Bclymer**: So we got.
**Bclymer**: We need SOC reports for that payroll company, and you need a SOC report for Procore, right?
**Justin**: Yes.
**Justin**: What's the SOC report from Procore look like?
**Justin**: What is soc.
**Justin**: What's stand for that?
**Bclymer**: That's like, you know, their.
**Bclymer**: Their.
**Bclymer**: Their controls or processes and everything.
**Bclymer**: They.
**Bclymer**: They get actually independent CPA to look at that.
**Bclymer**: So if it's available, we'll get it.
**Bclymer**: If not, no worries.
**Bclymer**: That usually your representative at Procore has access to it and they'll send it over.
**Justin**: Or requested, but they're not very good.
**Justin**: That's why we're dropping them.
**Justin**: So I wouldn't get your hopes up.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, it's not going to hold up the audit.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Evliao**: And.
**Evliao**: And we went over potential finish date and everything with Brandon as well.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So Maria had asked earlier.
**Bclymer**: So we're still on.
**Bclymer**: On track to finish mid May, Brandon, and hopefully before.
**Bclymer**: We're trying to target the 9th instead of the 14th, but we really need all this whip stuff to be cleared up.
**Justin**: Okay, what can we do?
**Justin**: Can we add another person to improve upon that?
**Bclymer**: We have, actually.
**Bclymer**: We have.
**Bclymer**: So as long as we.
**Bclymer**: As long as that WIP schedule and everything, the next version that we get looks good, then we're smooth sailing from there.
**Bclymer**: But we really need this stuff to be cleaned up.
**Justin**: All right, so.
**Evliao**: And when are we doing just version, Fatima?
**Evliao**: We're working on that.
**Evliao**: You're muted.
**Mcalcetero**: Yes, I'll start working on it after this meeting.
**Evliao**: Okay.
**Justin**: All right, Maria, make sure that if Justin or Fatima or anybody needs me for something, like, get them a window, block out some time on my schedule for me to walk through some stuff with them so that we can get this done really quick.
**Asupit**: Yes, I will.
**Asupit**: And then just to confirm, so I'm going to send you the recording to everybody of the Fireflies.
**Asupit**: Just think, I've already asked the person for the 2024 payroll, so I'll keep you posted on that.
**Asupit**: And then also, Brandon, I'll send you something, so just confirm with me so we can send them to them as well.
**Justin**: Okay?
**Justin**: Okay, cool.
**Bclymer**: Excellent.
**Bclymer**: Much appreciated, Brandon.
**Bclymer**: Safe drive.
**Justin**: All right, thanks, guys.
**Bclymer**: Okay, bye.
**Justin**: Thank you, guys.
