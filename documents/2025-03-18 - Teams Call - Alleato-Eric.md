## Transcript
**Bclymer**: Foreign.
**Bclymer**: Hey.
**Eric.haught**: Hey guys.
**Eric.haught**: How's it going?
**Eric.haught**: Very good, very good.
**Eric.haught**: How you guys doing?
**Bclymer**: Well, I'm down here, I'm down here in Tampa seeing how we do things.
**Eric.haught**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: It's been fun so far.
**Bclymer**: Sure, sure.
**Bclymer**: I noticed on your email, I didn't know when we had met in Dallas, I know you were meeting with Chase.
**Bclymer**: Right, guys, with Chase Bank.
**Bclymer**: Obviously on your email it's cbre.
**Bclymer**: So how does that relationship work?
**Eric.haught**: Yeah, so, right, the guys I was with were my clients, my friends I consider.
**Eric.haught**: But essentially, right, we are a contractor for JPMorgan Chase.
**Eric.haught**: So, right.
**Eric.haught**: We act in principle on their behalf.
**Eric.haught**: So that's the relationship.
**Eric.haught**: So they've contracted CBRE to do facility maintenance for Florida to Ohio and West.
**Eric.haught**: Right.
**Eric.haught**: We're kind of outside of the east, the New York area.
**Eric.haught**: That's another partner of theirs.
**Eric.haught**: So what I do is, right, I do infrastructure projects for their commercial office buildings there.
**Eric.haught**: You know, I mean, from an operations center to a call center to any of that.
**Eric.haught**: So we do, you know, like I said at that, that night, it's like, oh, well, we manage projects.
**Eric.haught**: That guy Chris is not managing projects anymore.
**Eric.haught**: He's coming to me to manage those projects for him and then he's governing me and right.
**Eric.haught**: We're presenting, you know, funding requests to him.
**Eric.haught**: So that's how that works.
**Bclymer**: When you say infrastructure, are you just talking like underground utilities to new buildings or what exactly do you mean?
**Eric.haught**: Yeah, so it's existing buildings, right?
**Eric.haught**: That, that we are, we currently manage under, under our contract.
**Eric.haught**: So, Right, we have 100 North Tampa.
**Eric.haught**: Right.
**Eric.haught**: There's a couple floors there.
**Eric.haught**: We do projects there.
**Eric.haught**: There is a place out in, it's called Highland Manor.
**Eric.haught**: It's out there off of MLK and I75.
**Eric.haught**: And then today I'm over by the airport site called Fountain Square.
**Eric.haught**: So what we do is, right, H vac roofs for facades, electrical ups.
**Eric.haught**: We really don't provide new services to two buildings.
**Eric.haught**: Right.
**Eric.haught**: That's just kind of outside of our scope of work.
**Eric.haught**: If there is a tenant improvement or something that requires that, typically there's another, another department within JPMorgan Chase that handles that type of, those type of projects.
**Bclymer**: Gotcha.
**Bclymer**: So you guys are mainly geared at facility maintenance projects and, and services.
**Eric.haught**: Yep.
**Eric.haught**: Lifestyle.
**Eric.haught**: Lifestyle.
**Eric.haught**: Life cycle refreshes on, you know, all the building infrastructure.
**Eric.haught**: I mean, we do elevators and a number of other things too.
**Eric.haught**: So it's awesome.
**Bclymer**: So it's.
**Bclymer**: Is Chase your full time client or do you have others?
**Eric.haught**: Yeah, Chase is my full time client.
**Eric.haught**: I have seven people, seven project Managers that work under me.
**Eric.haught**: I just opened another position.
**Eric.haught**: So I'll have eight project managers.
**Eric.haught**: Right.
**Eric.haught**: I have there.
**Eric.haught**: I got Ohio, one's in Ohio right now, one's in Indiana, one's in Illinois for having somebody that reports to me in Florida, two in Texas and one in California.
**Bclymer**: So that's awesome.
**Bclymer**: I mean, we bank with Chase, so makes it nice.
**Eric.haught**: Oh, go ahead.
**Bclymer**: No, I was just saying one thing we had talked about, Eric, is, you know, we have, we have an indie office.
**Bclymer**: We recently opened our Tampa office in, in September.
**Bclymer**: But the thing we're really good at one is our speed to marketing too.
**Bclymer**: The fact that we travel so well and so a lot of our clients are repeat clients because they know that they can use us in pretty much every state needed.
**Bclymer**: And so I thought it would be cool to get you and Brandon together because Brandon lives part time down here and to see maybe where we can help you.
**Bclymer**: See, I didn't know if you use GCS a lot or how.
**Eric.haught**: Yeah, absolutely.
**Bclymer**: Your jobs usually go.
**Eric.haught**: Absolutely, we use gcs.
**Eric.haught**: Right.
**Eric.haught**: I mean some of the larger infrastructure projects, I mean some, like a train or somebody like that, they may give us a turnkey solution, but their markups might tend to be a little higher.
**Eric.haught**: Right.
**Eric.haught**: Or right.
**Eric.haught**: You know, there's, there's some, some other things there that a GC can do.
**Eric.haught**: Right.
**Eric.haught**: And pivot a little bit better for us to align with our, you know, our approved budget.
**Eric.haught**: So yeah, by all means, we, we need GCs.
**Eric.haught**: We need, we need more GCs.
**Eric.haught**: Yeah, absolutely.
**Bclymer**: So when you guys do these projects, let's say you had a infrastructure project in Tampa, for instance, for Chase Call Center.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: So you're going to go in and change out all the RTUs and put in a new BAS system.
**Bclymer**: So you would go out and bid that out to.
**Bclymer**: I would think you would use a straight H VAC company in lieu of actually hiring out a gc.
**Eric.haught**: Yeah, I mean, it's going to be project by project basis.
**Eric.haught**: Right.
**Eric.haught**: We have a generator project in Orlando, so.
**Eric.haught**: Right.
**Eric.haught**: We're getting, we have a GC involved in that.
**Eric.haught**: Right.
**Eric.haught**: They're going to run the electrical, they're going to procure the generator.
**Eric.haught**: Right.
**Eric.haught**: They're going to have civil, they're going to have, you know, probably some storm water items.
**Eric.haught**: Right.
**Eric.haught**: They're also going to have to, you know, modify interior, interior rooms to fit the new ATS units and, and that type of stuff.
**Eric.haught**: So.
**Eric.haught**: Yeah, yeah, it's like project by project.
**Eric.haught**: I don't have like a, a cookie cutter project that I implement throughout, you know.
**Eric.haught**: Right.
**Eric.haught**: I've.
**Eric.haught**: We have.
**Eric.haught**: We have a change out of a generator in Tempe, Arizona.
**Eric.haught**: We're just going to you know Caterpillar, the local Caterpillar company to help us out with that.
**Eric.haught**: So it kind of all go ahead.
**Bclymer**: What are some of the things.
**Bclymer**: You know just my thought is with obviously Chase is a very big reputable client.
**Bclymer**: I would expect that any of the GCs that you worked with in the past, if there if any size and scale they would be like hey, we'll go do this stuff for you all over the country.
**Bclymer**: It's.
**Bclymer**: Is that a thing that you do or what limits that.
**Eric.haught**: Brandon?
**Eric.haught**: Mainly they're local, right.
**Eric.haught**: They're local resources that we use in each market is how it happens.
**Eric.haught**: We would love to have a kind of a one GC fits all and right.
**Eric.haught**: Be able to move that across, you know work with them across the country.
**Eric.haught**: There was a company out of Atlanta, we tried that.
**Eric.haught**: It didn't.
**Eric.haught**: They.
**Eric.haught**: They just couldn't move fast enough for us and right.
**Eric.haught**: Get out there.
**Eric.haught**: So we over committed to them and we, we slipped on a couple projects with them so we don't do business.
**Bclymer**: With them any longer outside of a emergency situation.
**Bclymer**: What is your Runway time of like hey, I've got something coming up in six months or do you.
**Bclymer**: Is it like hey, it's always coming a week, you know, next week.
**Eric.haught**: No, no, no, no, no.
**Eric.haught**: So what we typically have is right we develop a capital plan and really get into the weeds of all the projects the year prior.
**Eric.haught**: So we're kind of in that time frame.
**Eric.haught**: It's due to Chase by June.
**Eric.haught**: So that essentially solidifies the all the capital projects for the following year which would be like 2026.
**Eric.haught**: So then, then at that point there's some stuff we can do, right.
**Eric.haught**: We can do some design work in the like 2025.
**Eric.haught**: But what happened with this is they vote we over committed to them.
**Eric.haught**: So we had just say we had 10 projects to them and they couldn't cover.
**Eric.haught**: They couldn't get to the sites.
**Eric.haught**: They couldn't man.
**Eric.haught**: You know.
**Eric.haught**: Yeah.
**Eric.haught**: So then it was we're going to delay out where this isn't going to work.
**Eric.haught**: You know we have to you know, prioritize things for us.
**Eric.haught**: Those are the conversations that we can't have.
**Eric.haught**: We need somebody that can, you know be able to move and shake and if they got to bring people on board temporarily or do whatever they have to do.
**Eric.haught**: Right.
**Eric.haught**: We got to get the work done as initially prom premise as part of Our funding request.
**Eric.haught**: So right when we go in for funding, we're also talking about schedule dates, any kind of anticipated lead times.
**Eric.haught**: Now, tariffs is a big, big item that we're talking about.
**Eric.haught**: So, yeah, we are.
**Eric.haught**: We, you know, that.
**Eric.haught**: That's where we're at.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, that's.
**Bclymer**: That's valuable information.
**Bclymer**: So what kind of questions do you have for.
**Bclymer**: For us?
**Bclymer**: I.
**Bclymer**: I'm not sure what you and AJ kind of went over, but yeah, we haven't talked.
**Eric.haught**: Talked a lot.
**Eric.haught**: So, I mean, what, what is your guys's, you know, typical projects look like?
**Eric.haught**: Do you guys do infrastructure projects?
**Eric.haught**: Building envelope projects?
**Eric.haught**: How can, how could you help, you know, my business?
**Bclymer**: So we have, you know, I'd say two parent divisions.
**Bclymer**: And so our straight design build is going to be your traditional.
**Bclymer**: And then you have sectors inside of there.
**Bclymer**: So whether that be a warehouse, a.
**Bclymer**: A restaurant, office building, school, something like that, it's got to fit in that, that envelope.
**Bclymer**: And then we actually have an infrastructure division.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: And really what that is, is so in warehousing, when you do a pick module or any kind of robotic movements, so when, you know, your, your wife goes and orders something on Amazon, a robot grabs it and does it.
**Bclymer**: Well, there's a ton of power, sprinkler, lighting, life safety structure, everything that goes in that.
**Bclymer**: So we have a part of our company that just does that.
**Bclymer**: And so wherever that's it in the country, we'll go do a structure projects.
**Bclymer**: I think, you know, right now, one in Dallas, just finished one in Georgia.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Pennsylvania, New Jersey.
**Bclymer**: I was, I was telling you though, about the Dallas one briefly.
**Eric.haught**: Right.
**Bclymer**: That's why I was in Dallas, was going to see that project.
**Bclymer**: And that one was for Ulta Beauty.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Eric.haught**: And that was one of their kind of fulfillment centers or something you guys were in.
**Bclymer**: Yes, Ulta Beauty has three fulfillment centers.
**Bclymer**: They have one in Greenwood, Dallas, and then one in Fresno.
**Bclymer**: So they're going through this big change with adding automation and doing this.
**Bclymer**: And so we did their Greenwood one, we'll do their Dallas one, and then we'll do their Fresno one next.
**Eric.haught**: Okay, what is, how many projects do you typically complete a year, would you say, on average?
**Bclymer**: I mean, we're growing a lot.
**Bclymer**: I mean, I'd say this year, I mean, because the big projects, like some projects will take a year and a half, right.
**Bclymer**: And so these infrastructure projects particularly might take two months or something like that, and we'll do 10 of them right now or so.
**Eric.haught**: Okay.
**Eric.haught**: Okay.
**Eric.haught**: The reason why I ask, right, we do 150 projects with my team a year.
**Eric.haught**: So, yeah, it would be full.
**Bclymer**: It would be foolish for me to come in and, hey, give me all your jobs because, hey, I, I only want to work with people that I like.
**Bclymer**: And the first kiss is always the hardest.
**Bclymer**: And so, you know, understanding how we work, does this fit?
**Bclymer**: Is it great?
**Bclymer**: Does, you know, you know, do we mesh together?
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Life's too short for people you don't like.
**Bclymer**: And also you as a, you know, as an intelligent owner, operator, you don't want all yours in one basket, so you're going to want some other relationships.
**Eric.haught**: So.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I would not want to do that, but, you know, happy to definitely take a look at some stuff and see what makes sense.
**Bclymer**: Also, you have to think about depending on the state licensing comes into play, right?
**Bclymer**: So, like, if you're like, hey, Brandon, I got a job in New York.
**Bclymer**: I got.
**Bclymer**: Architect called me yesterday about all this New York stuff and I just said, no, like, I just don't want to go to New York, period.
**Eric.haught**: I don't blame you.
**Eric.haught**: I don't want that hassle.
**Eric.haught**: Right.
**Eric.haught**: We have projects in California and we have to deal with it.
**Eric.haught**: So it's, it's tough.
**Eric.haught**: Right.
**Eric.haught**: We're going through a number of projects out there where they're requirements are a little over, over the top, in my opinion, so.
**Bclymer**: I agree.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So as far as, you know, what you guys have on, on the table, I don't know if you're, you're saying stuff for six months out or is it all next year?
**Eric.haught**: Oh, no, we still have a large plan to work through this year.
**Eric.haught**: You know, I think we still have 105 projects to get approved.
**Eric.haught**: So some of those have some design dollars to them.
**Eric.haught**: Some engineers have, you know, looked at them kind of, you know, gave us some conceptual ideas and we're vetting through approvals on that.
**Eric.haught**: But yeah, we have a book, a large book of work we're still working through.
**Eric.haught**: What.
**Eric.haught**: What would be your strongest markets, Brandon?
**Eric.haught**: What would you say?
**Eric.haught**: Would it be Tampa?
**Eric.haught**: Would it, you know, because that's where if I would.
**Eric.haught**: Would do.
**Eric.haught**: Want to see, get.
**Eric.haught**: Get a number from you, right, On a certain project and understand how this relationship could grow.
**Eric.haught**: What would be a good market to do that?
**Eric.haught**: Would it be Dallas?
**Eric.haught**: Would it be Tampa?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, so right now I would say, you know, Florida.
**Bclymer**: I mean, Tampa would be great, but Florida in general is, Is a market.
**Bclymer**: I mean, we have stuff on the east coast and the west coast and whatnot.
**Bclymer**: So Florida.
**Bclymer**: And if it's better just because nobody has to drive, which is always nice.
**Bclymer**: Indiana, we have office there as well.
**Bclymer**: And then.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I mean, we have, I think, one project going on.
**Bclymer**: Dallas.
**Bclymer**: We're gonna start another one.
**Bclymer**: So we're.
**Bclymer**: We're very keen in that environment as well.
**Bclymer**: So those are three of them that I would say that are pretty easy, especially Indiana and Florida, because we've got home bases there.
**Eric.haught**: Okay.
**Eric.haught**: Yeah.
**Eric.haught**: We don't have a lot of buildings in Indiana, obviously.
**Eric.haught**: There's.
**Eric.haught**: It's called Indy West Ops right there by the airport.
**Eric.haught**: But other than that, I don't.
**Eric.haught**: I really don't think there's much that.
**Eric.haught**: On the commercial side, there might be a retail bank branch at every corner, but that's not my team.
**Eric.haught**: Right.
**Eric.haught**: My team's doing the larger commercial office buildings, so.
**Eric.haught**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Stuff in the Tampa area.
**Eric.haught**: I need to look at what we have.
**Eric.haught**: But, yeah, we do have several projects in the.
**Eric.haught**: In the.
**Eric.haught**: In the Tampa area.
**Eric.haught**: I know we're.
**Eric.haught**: We're utilizing a GC on.
**Eric.haught**: On one project right now.
**Eric.haught**: Just had a conversation with them today.
**Eric.haught**: That's why I'm on site.
**Eric.haught**: So, you know, let's.
**Eric.haught**: Let me.
**Eric.haught**: Let me look at the plan and see what.
**Eric.haught**: Which project managers assigned to it and, you know.
**Eric.haught**: You know, put you guys in touch and see if it makes sense.
**Bclymer**: Certainly.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: And.
**Bclymer**: And I'm not sure if AJ Took you, but.
**Bclymer**: So we.
**Bclymer**: We're design build.
**Bclymer**: So we.
**Bclymer**: We often.
**Bclymer**: Nine times out of 10, we'll do the design and the build concurrently.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Eric.haught**: Got it.
**Eric.haught**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: No, happy to take a look at some stuff.
**Bclymer**: And then, you know, how does.
**Bclymer**: I guess, do you guys do the contract, or are you just basically saying, here's who we're using and.
**Bclymer**: And Chase is cutting a po.
**Bclymer**: What's the typical delivery method?
**Eric.haught**: Yeah, so it's principal.
**Eric.haught**: So you'd have a contract with CBRE and you'd get a CBRE poo right on CBRE paper.
**Bclymer**: Gotcha.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Eric.haught**: Yeah.
**Eric.haught**: Now, I'll just.
**Eric.haught**: I'll just say this, right?
**Eric.haught**: You'll see it in my email signature.
**Eric.haught**: You can, you know, see it throughout some publications with cbre, but CBRE did purchase Turner and Townsend.
**Eric.haught**: I'm not sure if you're aware of them, but that's a kind of like a global project management company.
**Eric.haught**: So we are in.
**Eric.haught**: Currently transitioning over to that.
**Eric.haught**: To that company.
**Eric.haught**: We'll be the largest project management company in the world.
**Eric.haught**: So that's.
**Eric.haught**: It's exciting time for.
**Eric.haught**: For us, for sure.
**Bclymer**: Global domination.
**Eric.haught**: Yes.
**Eric.haught**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I saw.
**Bclymer**: I saw.
**Bclymer**: I saw an article about that recently.
**Bclymer**: I've seen a couple CBRE project managers I've worked with in the area for emails already.
**Eric.haught**: So, yeah, yeah, we're, we're on this account.
**Eric.haught**: We're currently co branded.
**Eric.haught**: So you'll see, you know, CBRE and Turner and Townsend, but eventually that.
**Eric.haught**: Right.
**Eric.haught**: That'll go to their, you know, Hallmark, you know, Turner and Townsend branding, you know, full suite.
**Eric.haught**: So.
**Bclymer**: Awesome.
**Eric.haught**: Yeah.
**Eric.haught**: So, yeah, let me, let me peel through the, the plan.
**Eric.haught**: Let me see what, what projects make sense.
**Eric.haught**: I'll circle back.
**Eric.haught**: I do have your guys's email from, from this meeting invite.
**Eric.haught**: I'll circle back and we'll kind of go from there.
**Bclymer**: Awesome.
**Bclymer**: Thanks, Eric.
**Eric.haught**: Okay, thanks, guys.
**Eric.haught**: We'll be in touch.
