## Transcript
**Ataylor**: Hey, AJ yes, sir?
**Ataylor**: Are you a little bitter that your ex coach might win the national championship?
**Jdawson**: Are you.
**Jdawson**: You're talking.
**Jdawson**: Yes, I am.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And I'm especially bitter because if Nil would have been around 10 years ago, we wouldn't have lost him 15 years ago.
**Ataylor**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Which is a bit ridiculous.
**Jdawson**: And I'm not a.
**Jdawson**: If, If I'm not a huge fan of our new coach either, but we'll see.
**Ataylor**: Is that the guy from West Virginia?
**Ataylor**: Is that who they hired?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, de.
**Jdawson**: So we'll see.
**Jdawson**: But should be a good final four.
**Ataylor**: You see the kid for Florida that doesn't get to play because he's 7 9?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, he.
**Jdawson**: He's too tall.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Can you imagine being 7 9?
**Jdawson**: No, I can't imagine being 6 foot.
**Ataylor**: I'd like to imagine being 5 10.
**Jdawson**: You.
**Bclymer**: Me, both.
**Jdawson**: How has everything been, Eric?
**Jdawson**: Have you guys heard much from the government?
**Ataylor**: No, we just got back our.
**Ataylor**: All of our SOPs and work instructions and all of that stuff from our consultants.
**Ataylor**: So we're about ready to resubmit.
**Ataylor**: They're having some technical writers review it for.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, okay.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: People that hopefully will catch the little things that the government's going to come in there and catch.
**Jdawson**: But a nitpick.
**Ataylor**: Nitpick.
**Ataylor**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Well, Delta United.
**Jdawson**: I got a text from Doug, so he's on his way out there to.
**Jdawson**: He's looking at three things.
**Jdawson**: The guard rail, the cutting in the doors as we just talked about, And.
**Jdawson**: Or cutting in the windows and setting that permanently.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, I know Bobby's worried about the setting.
**Jdawson**: I know he is.
**Jdawson**: Why?
**Jdawson**: And I told him not to bother you about it because if you bother you every day.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, it's not a bother.
**Jdawson**: I know, but it's not.
**Jdawson**: He needs to be bothering Mitch.
**Jdawson**: There's a.
**Jdawson**: What's the word?
**Jdawson**: He doesn't need to be bothering you.
**Jdawson**: That's all.
**Jdawson**: But that being said, I told them to make sure they.
**Jdawson**: They went through and triple checked all of our conduits that we ran up above the ceiling to make sure that they aren't resting on anything.
**Ataylor**: So.
**Jdawson**: So Bobby has stuff to be doing.
**Jdawson**: That way we just leave no doubt with our friend Shane.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And as soon as I get that letter, I'll.
**Jdawson**: I'll send it to Steve and then we should be done with his review.
**Jdawson**: So anybody want to call Steve and see if he's going to join?
**Jdawson**: Oh, there he is.
**Bclymer**: He's on the call.
**Jdawson**: What's up, Steve?
**Jdawson**: I didn't see you joined.
**Speaker 3**: I'm here.
**Jdawson**: How we doing?
**Jdawson**: Sir.
**Speaker 3**: Good.
**Speaker 3**: How are you?
**Jdawson**: Hanging in there.
**Speaker 3**: What's new?
**Jdawson**: Oh, just getting a couple things done for your guard shack.
**Jdawson**: Other than that we're.
**Jdawson**: We're ready to rock and roll as soon as I get that.
**Jdawson**: That, that letter.
**Jdawson**: And the structural engineer just replied to me and said he was working on it.
**Jdawson**: I'll send that to you, Steve.
**Jdawson**: And that should accomplish all Shane's comments.
**Speaker 3**: For now.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: Cool.
**Speaker 3**: And then I did pass on basically a breakdown cost of all the different categories and just a description of you know what each category was to real op because we're I think pretty close to signing a lease renewal and getting some ti dollars from them to.
**Speaker 3**: They're kind of looking at, you know, what they would be willing to cover and what they wouldn't.
**Speaker 3**: Okay.
**Speaker 3**: Categories like you know, probably H vac, probably electrical transformer stuff but you know, not some of the other stuff I imagine.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Do you timeline wise what do you foresee?
**Speaker 3**: I don't know.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 3**: If I told you anything it probably sure it would be wrong.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I think the plan just so we're on the same page so we have all of our drawings done.
**Jdawson**: Obviously we would want to submit to Shane before we submit it to the city.
**Ataylor**: Right.
**Jdawson**: That way he doesn't get on us for.
**Jdawson**: For noticing our submission to the city for permits is predates our submission to him.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, I mean I do.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: So I do think we're probably ready to send it to him.
**Speaker 3**: I guess the only thing is that I would like to if we could have this stuff finalized for this structural engineering comments so that I could send.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, let's necessarily.
**Speaker 3**: Let's send.
**Bclymer**: Let's do it in order because rushing it's just going to piss him off.
**Bclymer**: So let's just for sure.
**Bclymer**: Let's just for sure do you introduction a row and just do it straight as an arrow.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, yeah.
**Speaker 3**: Ideally I would like to say, you know, we're done with phase one now here's on to phase two stuff kind of.
**Bclymer**: Yep, exactly.
**Bclymer**: Close one out and be done with it.
**Jdawson**: Well, sweet.
**Jdawson**: It's kind of.
**Jdawson**: I don't really have much updates besides that.
**Jdawson**: You guys have anything for me?
**Ataylor**: The only thing I have, and I'm not asking you to do this yet, I'm just asking about the possibility mid south put a lot of equipment and supplies in that little storage room back there.
**Ataylor**: You know what I'm talking about the.
**Jdawson**: North where our panels are for the.
**Jdawson**: The bore we did for the guard.
**Jdawson**: Jack.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: Not asking this yet, but it may be coming to a time when I need them to clear that stuff out, if that's possible.
**Jdawson**: You just.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I mean, you just let me know when.
**Jdawson**: At first, we thought we'd be there for a while, so they're.
**Jdawson**: They're.
**Jdawson**: I actually spoke with Mitch about that last time I was on site, so he just said whenever you want us to pull it off, we can.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Keep you up to date if I need it.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: Call me, shoot me a text.
**Jdawson**: I'll get them on it.
**Ataylor**: All right.
**Jdawson**: Steve, anything?
**Speaker 3**: I'm good.
**Speaker 3**: Appreciate it.
**Jdawson**: Alrighty, guys.
**Jdawson**: Have a good day, all right?
