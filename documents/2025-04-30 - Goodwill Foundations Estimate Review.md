## Transcript
**Adelgado**: Board choice space.
**Adelgado**: So this number here, Glenn, for this line item for installation board.
**Gducharme**: Mm.
**Adelgado**: Is that what JL has here.
**Gducharme**: Or.
**Adelgado**: Is that just regular insulation for the walls that get framed and whatnot?
**Jdawson**: Why do they have bad insulation at all?
**Adelgado**: So that's just not even needed.
**Jdawson**: I don't think so.
**Jdawson**: Where.
**Jdawson**: Let me go and find.
**Jdawson**: So I guess install rigid board over sill insulation and paint black to match ceiling.
**Jdawson**: So, yeah, this isn't the window sill.
**Jdawson**: This is the.
**Adelgado**: That's not needed.
**Adelgado**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: This is like the floor sill of this.
**Jdawson**: Of the next floor up.
**Jdawson**: So he's.
**Jdawson**: He's actually referring to, like, the header of the wall.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Adelgado**: So it's extra.
**Adelgado**: We don't need.
**Jdawson**: No, we need it.
**Jdawson**: I'm just going to bust out a picture and show you.
**Adelgado**: It's for, like, sound and whatnot, right?
**Jdawson**: Well, no, it's thermal insulation.
**Adelgado**: All right, whatever.
**Jdawson**: This will work.
**Jdawson**: So we would put it in between the.
**Jdawson**: In between these floor joists and we paint all of this black.
**Jdawson**: We'll put a piece of crown molding up there to just kind of make a transition.
**Adelgado**: And it's only going at the end.
**Adelgado**: Caps.
**Adelgado**: Like the end of that joist.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, in.
**Jdawson**: In.
**Jdawson**: In here.
**Jdawson**: It'll go in the end because we already have channel.
**Jdawson**: No, it's not.
**Jdawson**: No, no.
**Jdawson**: It's just going here.
**Jdawson**: And.
**Jdawson**: And then we have this bad insulation.
**Jdawson**: That's the way I understood it from provided, though.
**Jdawson**: That's not 1500.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: There shouldn't be any bad installation.
**Jdawson**: Do you see any insulation on the drawings, Andres?
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Did you see any insulation, bat insulation on the drawings?
**Gducharme**: I don't think so.
**Jdawson**: I mean, it would only be on an exterior wall.
**Jdawson**: We're not taking out any of those exterior walls.
**Jdawson**: See anything about that?
**Jdawson**: Insulation?
**Adelgado**: Install rigid installation.
**Adelgado**: Yeah, you saw that, Glenn.
**Adelgado**: Paint black.
**Jdawson**: Where are you looking at?
**Adelgado**: General note 6.
**Adelgado**: That's what you were reading, though, earlier, where it said install rigid board.
**Adelgado**: Install rigid insulation board to cover all sill insulation.
**Adelgado**: Paint black.
**Adelgado**: Ceiling structure.
**Jdawson**: That was off of the scope.
**Jdawson**: Is that called the scope?
**Jdawson**: The scope sheet.
**Jdawson**: Scope sheet.
**Jdawson**: Look at the general notes.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Paint all ceiling exposed black.
**Jdawson**: Installing a crown rule at the top of the walls.
**Jdawson**: There we go.
**Jdawson**: Install rigid insulation board to cover all sill insulation.
**Jdawson**: Paint black with ceiling structure.
**Adelgado**: Is that.
**Adelgado**: Yeah.
**Adelgado**: So six on here?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: General note six.
**Jdawson**: Oh, yeah.
**Jdawson**: On the.
**Jdawson**: On the first floor.
**Jdawson**: On the lower level floor.
**Jdawson**: It does not say the same thing for the second floor.
**Jdawson**: But I thought he said we're doing that on the second floor, too.
**Jdawson**: I don't know why we wouldn't.
**Jdawson**: It's in the same condition.
**Gducharme**: SA.
**Adelgado**: Just have to clarify that.
**Adelgado**: Jesse.
**Adelgado**: All right, let's keep getting these numbers put in.
**Gducharme**: SA.
**Adelgado**: Is JL Doing the cedar columns?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, they picked up everything besides MEPs and the sealed concrete.
**Jdawson**: Polished concrete downstairs.
**Adelgado**: Why do they have wood framing?
**Jdawson**: Who?
**Adelgado**: Jail should be metal framing.
**Adelgado**: Right?
**Jdawson**: Wood framing.
**Adelgado**: Column framing.
**Adelgado**: Oh, is that.
**Adelgado**: Is there wood framing?
**Adelgado**: Are they talking about the cedar columns?
**Adelgado**: It says column framing labor.
**Adelgado**: Column prep labor.
**Adelgado**: Then it says floor joists.
**Adelgado**: Interior.
**Adelgado**: Yeah.
**Adelgado**: Interior wood framing labor to frame interior wood walls.
**Adelgado**: Note 5.
**Jdawson**: Reframe wall 6 inch for plumbing, stack relocation and fill door opening.
**Adelgado**: These are.
**Jdawson**: I mean, these are wood walls in here.
**Jdawson**: They're not metal.
**Adelgado**: Are we going to want to keep it wood framed?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I mean, we're not doing a whole lot of frame.
**Jdawson**: We're just topping out a couple of these walls.
**Adelgado**: See?
**Jdawson**: No refinery.
**Jdawson**: Reframe six inch.
**Jdawson**: That's.
**Jdawson**: That's going to be on the first floor only.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: We're building that new wall so we can reroute the plumbing up there for 6 inch plumbing.
**Adelgado**: They have the floor joist installed, but they only have two.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Adelgado**: Change that to four.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that's what it was originally.
**Jdawson**: But it needs to be four.
**Jdawson**: It's not a big deal.
**Jdawson**: It's like a hundred dollars difference in lumber.
**Jdawson**: They're not gonna fool me.
