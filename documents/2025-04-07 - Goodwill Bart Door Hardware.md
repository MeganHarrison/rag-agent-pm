## Transcript
**Whitemanb**: We doing Andrew?
**Gkelly**: Yeah, we're, we're just waiting on Glenn Mark right now.
**Whitemanb**: Did you invite from Glenmark?
**Gkelly**: Yeah, yeah, I think Griffin accepted.
**Whitemanb**: Shout to him right now.
**Gkelly**: Hey Griffin.
**Griffinkelly**: Yes sir.
**Gkelly**: Hey, how's it going?
**Griffinkelly**: Good, how are you doing?
**Acannon**: Good.
**Gkelly**: So we just wanted to talk about the missing hardware and I guess there were some light kits that came up were missing.
**Gkelly**: So were these turned over to Glenmark or how was the transition process?
**Griffinkelly**: Well, yeah, basically we got the doors, the light kits came with the doors and then after that the painters took them I guess so they could paint them.
**Griffinkelly**: We never unpackaged them.
**Griffinkelly**: We left them all where they, you know, originally were with the doors.
**Griffinkelly**: And so I don't, I don't know what happened to the light kits exactly.
**Griffinkelly**: I, I wasn't aware we were missing any.
**Whitemanb**: Good amount.
**Gkelly**: Do you take inventory of them when you get them, Griffin?
**Griffinkelly**: We didn't, we didn't take an inventory for those just because normally we don't deal with that.
**Griffinkelly**: We take inventory of, you know, like the doors, the hardware, make sure we've got everything.
**Griffinkelly**: But we, we never really messed with those side lights at all really.
**Griffinkelly**: They, they came with the doors on that pallet and we just, you know, left them in that daycare room and the painters had had a hold of them when they needed them.
**Acannon**: Okay.
**Gkelly**: And so the, the missing hardware.
**Gkelly**: I, I guess there's some missing hardware for some doors.
**Griffinkelly**: Yeah, there was, we were missing, it was kind of weird.
**Griffinkelly**: We were just missing a single piece of the hardware for the double doors by the vestibule.
**Griffinkelly**: On one.
**Gkelly**: It's just one piece.
**Griffinkelly**: Yeah, I, it's.
**Griffinkelly**: I, I couldn't really explain it over the phone.
**Griffinkelly**: I'd have to send you a picture.
**Griffinkelly**: But inside the mechanism of the latching mechanism there was a piece to screw the COVID plate on.
**Griffinkelly**: It had some like pre drilled machined holes in it so we could screw the COVID plate on, on one of the mechanisms.
**Griffinkelly**: It came already attached like it normally would on the other side.
**Griffinkelly**: It wasn't in the box, it wasn't attached to it or anything.
**Gkelly**: Could you send us an email of, with the information on that hardware, Griffin?
**Griffinkelly**: Yeah, I can send it to you.
**Griffinkelly**: I'm, I'm about 10 minutes away from that job right now, but I'm gonna head there here in a bit and I can send you a picture of that.
**Griffinkelly**: And then on the same door we were missing a singular piece of the spacer kit that they sent.
**Griffinkelly**: You know, it's kind of hard to explain over the phone, but I could Send you a picture of that as well when I get there.
**Acannon**: Okay.
**Gkelly**: Yeah, because we, we have the final next Tuesday, so if you, you can get us that information and then Brad, if you could place the order for that.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, I can definitely do that.
**Jcurtin**: I don't know if you still have the installation instructions.
**Jcurtin**: It'd probably just be easier to say, hey, I'm missing this piece and circle it.
**Griffinkelly**: Yeah, I could, I could take a look at it.
**Griffinkelly**: I, I could see if we still got that paper to make it a little easier for you.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, that'd be fantastic.
**Gkelly**: Okay.
**Gkelly**: And how hard is it to get those light kits, Brad?
**Jcurtin**: We supplied stock kits, I believe, so we, we should have some in stock.
**Jcurtin**: I just have to check the inventory.
**Acannon**: Okay.
**Gkelly**: And how many are we missing, Andrew?
**Whitemanb**: Let me pull up my notes.
**Whitemanb**: Is there's either 11 or 7, which is a big difference.
**Gkelly**: Okay.
**Gkelly**: We, we, we should.
**Gkelly**: Griffin, if you, if you can inventory every time you get the, the hardware from cih, because I know for Bloomington you're, you're also going to be doing the doors for that.
**Gkelly**: So it, that would probably help make sure we don't run into this issue in the future.
**Griffinkelly**: Yes, sir.
**Griffinkelly**: Yeah.
**Whitemanb**: 11 frames or 11 light kits.
**Acannon**: Okay.
**Acannon**: I believe set.
**Griffinkelly**: Seven.
**Acannon**: Seven glass.
**Whitemanb**: Yeah, seven pieces.
**Whitemanb**: Yeah, but that's through.
**Griffinkelly**: Yeah.
**Acannon**: Okay.
**Gkelly**: So yeah, if, if you could get us that info today, Griffin, and then we'll get that sent to Brad and we can get that stuff ordered.
**Gkelly**: So we should be.
**Jcurtin**: Those window kits are the full light kits.
**Whitemanb**: What was that?
**Jcurtin**: The, the window kits.
**Jcurtin**: That's a full light kit, is that right?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah.
**Whitemanb**: Or no, not full.
**Whitemanb**: It's just like the small, small window.
**Whitemanb**: I'll send you a picture.
**Jcurtin**: The narrow light like a 6 by 25 or something like that.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Acannon**: Okay.
**Gkelly**: Okay, I think we're good on this issue then.
**Gkelly**: Unless someone has anything to add.
**Whitemanb**: I would just say whenever we can get lead time and dates.
**Whitemanb**: Yeah, be good to know with it being close to being done next week.
**Acannon**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Griffinkelly**: I can shoot that email over to you here probably before 10 o'clock.
**Griffinkelly**: I'll have it to you.
**Griffinkelly**: So.
**Acannon**: Okay, perfect.
**Gkelly**: All right.
**Jcurtin**: That'd be fantastic.
**Jcurtin**: And then give me just a second here real quick and I can let you know what I have in stock for light kits.
**Acannon**: Perfect.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Whitemanb**: And if, obviously if anyone has any questions should have my number and Nick's number.
**Whitemanb**: So.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: So if we're looking at just like this could be a 4 by 25 visible light.
**Jcurtin**: It's the narrow light and I have to go back and check the project, but we got 30 of them in.
**Gkelly**: Stock so.
**Jcurtin**: You probably quickest ways come, come grab them.
**Whitemanb**: Yeah, yeah, we're not far from you guys, so yeah, let's confirm that size and then if we can pick them up tomorrow or today, just let us know.
**Acannon**: Okay?
**Acannon**: Yeah, we can do that.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Jcurtin**: And then just let me know on those that just missing hardware.
**Jcurtin**: Just let me know what pieces those are and we can figure out what's the quickest way to get those in.
**Whitemanb**: Awesome.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Gkelly**: Brad, where are you guys located?
**Whitemanb**: Nick, they're right by our shop or by our office.
**Gkelly**: By our office.
**Gkelly**: So maybe, maybe I could pick them up today.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, we're at 96 and 69.
**Jcurtin**: Where are you guys located?
**Whitemanb**: We're right, right behind Twin Peaks.
**Jcurtin**: Okay, sure.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, we're just a little bit north of you on Corporation Drive there.
**Gkelly**: Okay.
**Gkelly**: After this meeting, could it, could I stop by there and then I can bring them to, to buy it?
**Jcurtin**: Certainly.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: Let me just double check.
