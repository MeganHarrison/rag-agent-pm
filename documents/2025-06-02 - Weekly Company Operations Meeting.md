**Bclymer**: The.
**Bclymer**: The.
**Bclymer**: The one above it.
**Bclymer**: That was additional pricing for firearm, not sprinklers.

**Bclymer**: Oh, yeah, they're gonna do.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, they're.
**Bclymer**: They're gonna do a.

**Bclymer**: Like, that's.
**Bclymer**: Again, months from now.
**Bclymer**: Three months from now.
**Bclymer**: Before we.
**Bclymer**: They don't even have the racking design yet.
**Adelgado**: All right, let's do August 8th.
**Adelgado**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: And then priority will be probably low.
**Adelgado**: Medium.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Adelgado**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: This is Nick, Goodwill Corp.
**Adelgado**: Office.
**Gducharme**: I spoke to the engineer today.
**Gducharme**: The city is requiring a bunch of extra permits, so who's just looking at that?
**Gducharme**: And he's going to get back to me.
**Adelgado**: Okay, this is June 2nd.
**Adelgado**: June 2nd.
**Adelgado**: We should change these two.
**Adelgado**: So schedule work with paving.
**Adelgado**: Paving.
**Adelgado**: This should be where.
**Adelgado**: What day.
**Gducharme**: Do these a month from now?
**Adelgado**: Okay, let's do July 7th.
**Adelgado**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: The line is here.
**Jmendez**: Yes.
**Adelgado**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: Westfield Collective.
**Jmendez**: Westfield Collective.
**Jmendez**: We got our full CDR on Friday.
**Jmendez**: Working on getting the.
**Jmendez**: I put the acronym in there.
**Jmendez**: Now I can't remember what it is.
**Jmendez**: The road impact fees.
**Jmendez**: Road impact fee assessment.
**Bclymer**: Listen, that is.
**Jmendez**: So I got that.
**Jmendez**: I sent that over to Mike and Katie to see if they want to pay for it or do a change order because it's 370 some thousand dollars.
**Jmendez**: Still waiting on the auditor to combine parcel IDs.
**Jmendez**: He hadn't as of about lunchtime.
**Jmendez**: Other than that, AG Pierce just got finished up or are being finished up.
**Jmendez**: Fence got taken down.
**Jmendez**: And from what Chad was saying out there, Katie was reaching out to her fencing company and they were planning on moving it in.
**Jmendez**: So maybe they knew they put it out too far.
**Jmendez**: But at this point it doesn't seem like it's going to cost us to move their fence in.
**Bclymer**: So next week we're planning on having foundations going in, correct?
**Jmendez**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Is that still looking possible or.
**Jmendez**: It is, yeah.
**Jmendez**: Yeah.
**Jmendez**: I don't, I don't know what day our permit will be ready, but everything, everything seems to be flowing in the right direction.
**Bclymer**: Okay, and then did.
**Bclymer**: Did we cross reference and double check the AG peer drawings in our latest and greatest foundation drawings and architectural pre injured metal building.
**Bclymer**: Did we go out and actually pull tape to confirm all that stuff?
**Jmendez**: Anything different than what you had Chad do this morning?
**Jmendez**: I don't.
**Jmendez**: He's not on here, so I don't know what else he did in addition to what he went and checked this morning.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so that did get done.
**Bclymer**: And did it match and.
**Jmendez**: Yes.
**Jmendez**: Yeah, he ran.
**Jmendez**: He ran a couple lines from B to C.
**Jmendez**: Then I think he went over to the north northwest corner and did one horizontally and so they lined up.
**Jmendez**: So.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so what is some of this like brain tile bond?
**Bclymer**: Like all that kind of.
**Bclymer**: Is that done or kitchen equipment?
**Jmendez**: I just finished the kitchen equipment submittals today.
**Jmendez**: I just got the last of the kitchen change order.
**Jmendez**: Actually that's not true.
**Jmendez**: I'm still waiting on one more price each for the bathroom and the change order for the kitchen.
**Jmendez**: The drain tile bond.
**Jmendez**: I am waiting for them to come out and do their inspection design dates is the IFC is the last thing I'm waiting for there.
**Jmendez**: Ilp obviously you know about that center point.
**Jmendez**: The encroachment permit and the new service both are in motion right now.
**Bclymer**: Did Jeff send his drawings?
**Jmendez**: No, he said he'd have them.
**Jmendez**: He texted me a little bit ago saying that he have a full packet coming this evening.
**Jmendez**: Taking longer to pick up the last red lines to compile than estimated.
**Jmendez**: We'll have 100 today though.
**Jmendez**: And no extra charges from him for the design of the kitchen or the added bathroom.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, no, can't get it.
**Bclymer**: Can't hit a deadline.
**Bclymer**: Save his life.
**Bclymer**: I was ready for that conversation, trust me.
**Jmendez**: Do you want to know where we're at with the bathroom?
**Jmendez**: Does it matter?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I mean, I guess, you know, where's the price?
**Bclymer**: I guess we're still getting pricing.
**Jmendez**: You said right I mean, I know what it's going to be based on price.
**Jmendez**: I'm just waiting on them to send a formal estimate back.
**Jmendez**: It'll be a little less when we're at 75, 000 with our fees and everything in there.
**Jmendez**: Okay, kitchen is done.
**Jmendez**: Dean gave me a change order, but didn't have it broken out really well.
**Jmendez**: So they're gonna.
**Jmendez**: He's gonna break it back out and send it over to me.
**Jmendez**: Can you guys confirm whether we were supposed to have white strip lighting underneath the bar?
**Jmendez**: I gave them a.
**Jmendez**: A price to add all those LED lightings and RGBW lightings.
**Jmendez**: But did you guys have that in the design intent to have, like, the.
**Jmendez**: Just the regular white strip lighting at the.
**Jmendez**: At the bars?
**Bclymer**: You come out, like at the.
**Bclymer**: The.
**Bclymer**: The bar where the first and second floor people are sitting?
**Jmendez**: Yeah.
**Jmendez**: All the bars?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jmendez**: It could be under the.
**Jmendez**: It would be underneath the bar.
**Jmendez**: The bar top.
**Bclymer**: No, I mean, we.
**Bclymer**: I mean, is that a request that came from Mike or what?
**Jmendez**: It was a request when we did our meeting here in the office that day, and I got pricing for the LEDs and the strip lighting, and they decided, no, we're not going to do that.
**Jmendez**: It was almost $200,000 for all that.
**Jmendez**: They decided, we're not going to do that.
**Jmendez**: But Deem still has it in there, and they only had white lighting.
**Jmendez**: So my question was, was white lighting always a part of the bars?
**Jmendez**: From the beginning with you guys?
**Jmendez**: And, and I had just asked him to switch to the RGB lights because I.
**Jmendez**: I didn't think that was the case.
**Jmendez**: But they still had it on their pricing.
**Jmendez**: So if that's not the case, they need to take that off from their change order.
**Bclymer**: So this change order from Deem, you're asking, should they have this added lighting in it or not?
**Jmendez**: Yeah.
**Jmendez**: Was that.
**Jmendez**: Was that supposed to be part of what you.
**Jmendez**: What you guys talked about with the lighting in the beginning?
**Bclymer**: Not to my knowledge.
**Bclymer**: I mean, I didn't.
**Bclymer**: Unless it's something that Mike said they want to have under bar lighting.
**Bclymer**: That's the first I've heard of it.
**Jmendez**: Okay, then.
**Jmendez**: No.
**Jmendez**: All right, so then, yeah, all I need him is the change order for the kitchen.
**Jmendez**: I gotta change order for everybody else for the bathroom.
**Jmendez**: Jail was gonna give me some final pricing on the tile and the paint.
**Jmendez**: They didn't give it to me, but I plugged in the numbers.
**Jmendez**: So based on what I knew they would be.
**Bclymer**: Before you do those change orders, make sure that you get with either Jesse or myself to Walk through all that?
**Jmendez**: Yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: Well you said jl so is J like jails doing.
**Bclymer**: Did you award them a scope?
**Bclymer**: What are they doing?
**Jmendez**: I haven't but they're.
**Jmendez**: They're the lower ones on the price and they have.
**Jmendez**: I mean it's.
**Jmendez**: It's, you know, acoustic tile, insulation, drywall, the bathroom partitions and the tile wall.
**Bclymer**: So what about the framing?
**Jmendez**: And the framing?
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Exterior and interior, it's just.
**Jmendez**: Well, yeah.
**Jmendez**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Yes.
**Jmendez**: At the doors.
**Bclymer**: Walk through that.
**Bclymer**: Scope those proposals with Jesse before you award that please because that's.
**Bclymer**: There's a lot of finite details that can be missed there.
**Jmendez**: Good.
**Adelgado**: Thank you, Glenn.
**Adelgado**: Nick Siva, Dog dorps and flooring.
**Ataylor**: Wait a minute.
**Bclymer**: What job is this?
**Adelgado**: 25.
**Adelgado**: I'm not sure what job number is Nick.
**Adelgado**: Do you know I didn't.
**Gducharme**: I didn't think.
**Gducharme**: This is my child.
**Adelgado**: It says.
**Bclymer**: Current but it doesn't have a job number.
**Bclymer**: So that's not right.
**Adelgado**: So it should be an estimating.
**Adelgado**: Yeah, this actually should be.
**Adelgado**: Why is it move here?
**Adelgado**: I don't know.
**Adelgado**: Let's move it.
**Adelgado**: Just a minute.

**Bclymer**: I still have to do that.
**Bclymer**: God damn it.
**Bclymer**: Can somebody learn how to do these infrastructure jobs so I don't have to be a project manager anymore?
**Bclymer**: That would be a huge help.
**Ataylor**: Cab is on his way.
**Ataylor**: What do you need a change order?
**Ataylor**: You can write it.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, it's a change order for some added valves or some.
**Bclymer**: That Alex estimated and didn't actually get the whole estimates and now we're losing money.
**Bclymer**: Whatever.
**Bclymer**: So yes, I still need to do that.
**Bclymer**: It's on my list of never ending shit.
**Bclymer**: You need to learn this so that you can do this stuff.

**Adelgado**: Okay, thank you.
**Adelgado**: JC Random for Collective.

**Bclymer**: Who's going to do that?
**Ataylor**: The guy we're going to hire tomorrow.

**Adelgado**: Okay, perfect.
**Adelgado**: Nick Goodwill.
**Adelgado**: Tremond.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Gducharme**: This morning me and Andres reviewed the estimate.
**Gducharme**: We need to get pricing for the columns on the mezzanine and a few other small things and then it'll be ready.
**Bclymer**: What's it looking at right now, cost wise?
**Gducharme**: What was the total address?
**Njepson**: Let me check.
**Adelgado**: But is the estimate still not started or.
**Adelgado**: Andres, check it out.
**Gducharme**: It's in progress.
**Adelgado**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: And design price.
**Adelgado**: Let's put this for here as well.
**Njepson**: The total cost is 200,000.
**Bclymer**: That gold plated drywall.
**Bclymer**: What the.
**Bclymer**: All right, well, we got to look at that.
**Adelgado**: Eva Uniqlo.
**Kmass**: Yes.
**Kmass**: So we have.
**Kmass**: We mobilized today and the fence guys are there.
**Kmass**: They have 50% done and by tomorrow they should be all done.
**Kmass**: The submittals are being reviewed right now.
**Kmass**: We.
**Kmass**: We received the five sprinklers, the five sprinkler submittals back today and they were missing one one of the cut sheets.
**Kmass**: So that was sent back to them today.
**Kmass**: And.
**Bclymer**: Wait a minute.
**Bclymer**: We're missing what we are missing the.
**Kmass**: The switch valves from the fire sprinkler submittals.
**Bclymer**: Control valve.
**Kmass**: They call it a switch valve.
**Bclymer**: And is that something that is the reviewer sent back Correct.
**Kmass**: And we send it back to the subcontractor.
**Kmass**: And they.
**Kmass**: They sent back the.
**Kmass**: The cut sheet that was missing.
**Kmass**: And the permits we are still waiting on, I guess DOB and for change orders.
**Kmass**: I'm still looking through the drawings that we.
**Kmass**: The updated drawings that we received from the architect.
**Kmass**: I should finish that by today and possibly send it.
**Kmass**: Update everything on Job Planner tomorrow morning.
**Bclymer**: Where are we at on the change order for the.
**Bclymer**: What is the sand separator and the heads?
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Kmass**: That was.
**Kmass**: That was sent out last week.
**Bclymer**: Both of them?
**Kmass**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: How much was the sprinkler one that you did?
**Kmass**: Let me look through it.
**Bclymer**: SA yeah.
**Bclymer**: You didn't do one for sprinkler.
**Bclymer**: You have plumbing, piping and electrical on here.
**Kmass**: Oh, for the sprinkler.
**Kmass**: Are you talking about the.
**Kmass**: Because we were supposed to have one for added supports on the.
**Kmass**: On the ceiling, but that is not anymore since we're not doing six inch horizontals.
**Bclymer**: No, I'm.
**Bclymer**: It was for all the extra heads that they've got added.
**Bclymer**: If you look at that area on plan South.
**Bclymer**: So we'll go.
**Bclymer**: I'll go through it with you.
**Adelgado**: Okay, perfect.
**Adelgado**: So.
**Adelgado**: And this is Brendan still.
**Adelgado**: Okay, let's move on.
**Adelgado**: So this.
**Adelgado**: I don't see that.
**Adelgado**: This is AJ and this is Glenn Goodwill Foundations.
**Jmendez**: I'm expecting drawings back for that one today too for the permit set.
**Jmendez**: And we're ready to start next week.
**Jmendez**: There are schedule sent out.
**Jmendez**: All the contracts are out and being reviewed and expecting two of them or all of them back today?
**Jmendez**: At least two of them.
**Jmendez**: That's it.
**Jmendez**: Alex is going to be on that one starting next week.
**Bclymer**: Jesse, did you review this change order before Cava sent it out?
**Ataylor**: The one for.
**Ataylor**: We did.
**Ataylor**: The one that included the fence to add it or.
**Ataylor**: No, the fence.
**Ataylor**: The.
**Ataylor**: The plumbing included the difference.
**Ataylor**: We were short in the contract.
**Ataylor**: And then the ad for the oil water separator.
**Ataylor**: And then the other was.
**Bclymer**: Well, because the change request in here that's written calls out a cost for plumbing of 17,005 to 5.
**Bclymer**: And then the revenue is the same.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, because we already marked that up by like $9,000 to cover the underlying estimate.
**Bclymer**: Does that mean that the cost is not actually 17,525?
**Jdawson**: Correct.
**Ataylor**: The cost is.
**Ataylor**: Well, we got to write them a chain.
**Ataylor**: Well, no, the cost is actually like 9,000.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So we need to get with Kava and teach him how to write this up the correct way.
**Bclymer**: So you guys, whenever you do these changes in Job Planner, you go to the change request.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: In your Cost column is what we're paying the sub.
**Bclymer**: In the revenue column is what we're billing the owner.
**Bclymer**: Now, in times like this or other times where we're like, hey, you need to.
**Bclymer**: To.
**Bclymer**: To bake some numbers in there, then you have to go in and say, like when you click into the line item there that you're entering, you want to say manual entry.
**Bclymer**: And that allows you to put in a revenue of whatever you want, regardless of what the cost is.
**Bclymer**: Because right now, basically, if you were to process this, then we would be writing the sub an extra nine grand for this change.
**Bclymer**: So you always want to double check, check that to make sure it's accurate.
**Adelgado**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: When I already went Corindale, this is aj but this.
**Bclymer**: So Kava, you need to make a note.
**Bclymer**: This needs to be adjusted.
**Bclymer**: And because we've already written a change order to the owner, we'll have to figure out how we back in to change this to what it should be.
**Kmass**: All right.
**Adelgado**: Do you want to talk about the other projects?
**Adelgado**: Radial Martinsville.
**Kmass**: Yes.
**Kmass**: So last week we.
**Kmass**: We sent out updated drawings for the project.
**Kmass**: We added details showing how we are putting together the cage, and we sent it out for updated pricing from subcontractors.
**Kmass**: So Mike is going to be on site on Thursday and he's meeting with some of the subcontractors and they will be taking a look at the electrical stuff so they can get us pricing and candy.
**Kmass**: Andres and I, we are working on updating the scope for.
**Kmass**: For the project.
**Bclymer**: Have you.
**Ataylor**: Excuse me?
**Ataylor**: Have you talked to any of the fence subs to get a general idea of what this cage is going to cost?
**Kmass**: Andres, I don't know if you receive any.
**Kmass**: Any replies on the emails you send out this morning?
**Njepson**: No, not yet.
**Njepson**: I don't have any price of the cage.
**Bclymer**: Andres, when you call or when you send out these invites, are you following up with the phone call?
**Njepson**: Exactly.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And for all the subs people not answering or are you just, you know.
**Njepson**: The most of the time?
**Njepson**: He answered me, but I will follow up with another email and then I will call him.
**Ataylor**: And have you looked up any, like, online just to get a sense of what the materials are going to cost?
**Kmass**: I can do that with you, Andreas.
**Kmass**: After this, we can take a quick look on materials.
**Kmass**: I know it's mostly the welded material, the mess and angles that we're using.
**Kmass**: You can get quick pricing on those.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: We need to change this one, Andres, for FedEx cage pricing.
**Adelgado**: This is still June today, so change it for what date?
**Adelgado**: Friday.
**Adelgado**: Still not Started.
**Adelgado**: So we can change it maybe later.
**Adelgado**: Let's do 20.
**Adelgado**: So we give him.
**Adelgado**: What's one?
**Kmass**: Why does it say FedEx?
**Kmass**: Is it Amex?
**Ataylor**: Yeah, it should set American Express.
**Adelgado**: Okay.
**Kmass**: So you can change those to in progress.
**Adelgado**: This one.
**Adelgado**: Submittals in progress.
**Kmass**: No, the.
**Kmass**: The Amex page.
**Kmass**: Pricing.
**Bclymer**: Perfect.
**Adelgado**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: Thank you, Keva.
**Adelgado**: And your last one, Radial Avon.
**Kmass**: So for this one, we have sent out submittals for all the door stuff and we have approval on all of them but the door seals.
**Kmass**: And I have.
**Kmass**: I'm looking at getting the material directly from the manufacturer.
**Kmass**: And I.
**Kmass**: I talked to someone last week and, and this morning as well, and I sent him a picture of the existing material and the dimensions.
**Kmass**: So they are currently working on that.
**Kmass**: Hopefully they will get something to me tomorrow morning.
**Bclymer**: What's the issue on the dock seals?
**Kmass**: They wanted us to.
**Kmass**: So JP what's on site?
**Ataylor**: Like, JP called me and said the landlord doesn't want two different types of equipment at the loading dock doors.
**Ataylor**: And so we explained to them they were basically the same thing, but they just got a different name on it.
**Ataylor**: And so we, we just.
**Ataylor**: I said we'd follow up and see if it's going to be more or less that the same guy that was going to provide them will install them if we buy them.
**Ataylor**: So we're just getting a price to see what it.
**Ataylor**: Because they can't.
**Ataylor**: They don't have an agreement with that vendor.
**Ataylor**: Evidently they've had a beef in the past and they don't work together anymore.
**Ataylor**: So Kevin reached out to them.
**Ataylor**: They will sell direct to us.
**Ataylor**: We'll just see how much they are and then he'll install them and then the landlord will be happy make sure.

**Jdawson**: But I messed up on my.
**Jdawson**: For some reason I doubled up when I pulled the budget over to my contract.
**Jdawson**: So I'm working through that right now.
**Jdawson**: It says our contract amount is a million two when it's actually half that.
**Jdawson**: So I'll fix that and get that bill sent out for the design.

**Bclymer**: How many casework numbers did you get?
**Jdawson**: 3.
**Bclymer**: Is Midwest the one that we've used on other stuff that they can't hit a deadline to save their life?
**Jdawson**: No, no, they did.
**Jdawson**: Midwest did our office.
**Jdawson**: It's the only job we've ever done with them.
**Jdawson**: They did great.
**Bclymer**: And then you've got team on here twice.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I plugged their H vac numbers.
**Bclymer**: And then plumbing from McCurdy Plumbing.
**Jdawson**: McCurdy.
**Jdawson**: But it's that Scope is just an ad assuming we find out what alternates they're going to add tomorrow morning.
**Jdawson**: But right now the only plumbing scope is demo and cap and old sync.
**Jdawson**: So I sent them a price.
**Jdawson**: After repricing everything I took the contingency out of there.
**Jdawson**: I just kept a 15.
**Jdawson**: We had a $50,000 contingency.
**Jdawson**: I.
**Jdawson**: I bumped it down to 15 to make that number look good.
**Jdawson**: But on the buyout because I had sent them like a deduct of like 75 grand back when we were working on this new layout.
**Jdawson**: But we picked up.
**Jdawson**: I would have to go back and look at the estimate.
**Jdawson**: But we picked up quite a bit of money when I got everything repriced.
**Jdawson**: So that's a good thing.
**Jdawson**: Contract amount is less but we're making more money.
**Bclymer**: Is Apex the company that broke off from.

**Bclymer**: What about payment?
**Jdawson**: They're not asking for like any money down or anything.
**Jdawson**: They're.
**Jdawson**: I think they're good.
**Njepson**: Okay, now.
**Jdawson**: Now granted our.
**Jdawson**: Our contract for Neiman's is 20 grand.
**Jdawson**: So it's not like a tiny one compared to projects we have been buying glass on.

**Jdawson**: And that's why I was like, would you be okay?
**Jdawson**: Let's say he says no, do a contract.
**Jdawson**: If I wrote some legal jargon, I'm.
**Bclymer**: Fine with doing a P.O.
**Bclymer**: but if he's like, no, I want a contract and you know, we have a contract, use it.

**Bclymer**: But I don't want to spend a bunch of time and manpower energy, you know, like what's the, you know.
