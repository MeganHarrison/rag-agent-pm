## Transcript
**Bclymer**: Morning.
**Bclymer**: So what's up, Eli?
**Jdawson**: How we doing?
**Nbigler**: Good.
**Bclymer**: Over your right shoulder is a spot to be right.
**Jdawson**: Got the coffee bar and the all the liquor setup.
**Jdawson**: You accumulate a lot of bottles over the years when you have a couple bars and restaurants.
**Jdawson**: I don't even touch this stuff just for guests.
**Bclymer**: Chad and I could do some damage over there.
**Jdawson**: What's your spirit of choice?
**Bclymer**: Whiskey.
**Jdawson**: Whiskey.
**Jdawson**: If I'm drinking, it's usually tequila.
**Jdawson**: Reposado, man.
**Nbigler**: Good man.
**Bclymer**: Jeff.
**Bclymer**: Not on here.
**Jdawson**: You're in the new office.
**Nbigler**: Oh.
**Jdawson**: Can'T.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, now I can.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Everyone, this is Melissa and Kenzie.
**Jdawson**: They're at our new office, which is a disaster right now.
**Jdawson**: I couldn't make it in a time.
**Awoodhams**: Organize it soon.
**Jdawson**: What's that?
**Awoodhams**: We'll organize it soon.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we'll get there.
**Gdesmit**: New office is exciting.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, super exciting.
**Jdawson**: We just moved yesterday.
**Jdawson**: It's just a disaster.
**Jdawson**: We need furniture.
**Jdawson**: They gave us three desks that are all completely different.
**Gdesmit**: Perfect how you draw it up.
**Jdawson**: Just like.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that's a good look for a design firm.
**Gdesmit**: Hopefully it's not from ikea.
**Gdesmit**: Take you six days.
**Bclymer**: Honestly?
**Jdawson**: Honestly, I think I'd prefer it's from IKEA at this point.
**Nbigler**: Who else we waiting on?
**Bclymer**: Glenn?
**Bclymer**: Jeff, but he's not on this invite.
**Bclymer**: It appears he's been on it like he's a standing member, so I don't know why.
**Gdesmit**: Yeah, I didn't take anybody off.
**Bclymer**: He didn't.
**Bclymer**: He's just not on.
**Bclymer**: I didn't say he declined or anything.
**Bclymer**: Jerrica declined, which would have been fine if she had gotten me what needed yesterday when it was due.
**Bclymer**: We'll get started.
**Bclymer**: See ya.
**Bclymer**: All right, let's be quick.
**Bclymer**: Do we have anybody from Lee Master?
**Bclymer**: No, it's nobody from team.
**Jdawson**: So who is everybody here?
**Jdawson**: I'm here from Dean.
**Bclymer**: Alex.
**Bclymer**: How you doing?
**Nbigler**: All right.
**Nbigler**: All right.
**Bclymer**: I didn't recognize your name.
**Bclymer**: I thought Alex Woody was on the T.
**Bclymer**: I didn't realize that you were deemed.
**Nbigler**: All right, are.
**Bclymer**: Are you responsible for any of the pricing?
**Bclymer**: No, sir.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right, then.
**Bclymer**: Let's get going with what we have.
**Bclymer**: Did Jeff send you the models that you needed yet, Eli?
**Jdawson**: No, I signed some documentation and let me look through my emails to see if anything came in this morning.
**Jdawson**: No, nothing yet.
**Jdawson**: So it seems like he's still just purging his model.
**Jdawson**: So he's gonna send that to me once.
**Jdawson**: Once I get it.
**Jdawson**: I mean, we're gonna start cooking, so.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we'll move quickly once I have what we need.
**Nbigler**: Okay.
**Nbigler**: All right.
**Bclymer**: I guess While I have you guys here, since this nobody else is here, I can get some answers from you, hopefully.
**Nbigler**: Perfect.
**Bclymer**: Let's look at a couple things in question.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: All right, the bulkheads around these bars.
**Bclymer**: One, two, three.
**Bclymer**: We got the other bar upstairs.
**Bclymer**: Do you intend to put tile on those?
**Bclymer**: We had talked about doing tile.
**Jdawson**: Not on the bulkheads.
**Jdawson**: We'll do tile on the actual bars, but we're not going to do any tile or anything overhead, I don't think, at least.
**Bclymer**: So the bars or the bar bottoms they had selected just like a corrugated metal.
**Bclymer**: And I don't know if this is.
**Bclymer**: This could.
**Bclymer**: This could change based on you being involved now.
**Bclymer**: But, yeah, when we did our original design intent meeting, it was like a corrugated metal.
**Bclymer**: Maybe just like a rolled metal galvanized on the bottom of the bars and then up top on the bulkheads.
**Bclymer**: We obviously could have done the metal.
**Bclymer**: The drywall tile.
**Bclymer**: Somebody brought up doing tile on the bulkheads.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: The.
**Bclymer**: This is what we have for rendering so far.
**Bclymer**: Let me see how.
**Bclymer**: How it showed.
**Bclymer**: So here's like the wine bar and coffee bar.
**Bclymer**: So all of that back wall will be tile.
**Bclymer**: We have this corrugated metal around here.
**Bclymer**: And then up here, it's obviously just right now drywall.
**Bclymer**: But that would either be this or tile.
**Bclymer**: And then same thing with the ice cream bar over here.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I'd probably rather keep the tile off the top, only because they're going to do a ton of signage, most likely like we did in the existing space.
**Jdawson**: Also, we have Shosugi Bon up there.
**Jdawson**: That was our.
**Jdawson**: Our finishing, but I don't think we're going to be doing that in this space.
**Jdawson**: It's gonna.
**Bclymer**: What was that last thing?
**Jdawson**: It's called Shosugi Bond.
**Jdawson**: It's that Japanese, like, style of charred wood.
**Jdawson**: So that's what we're doing up there in Liberty Collective.
**Jdawson**: So I don't think we're doing that here unless we can figure out how to work the budget in.
**Jdawson**: We have a tiled bar front.
**Jdawson**: We don't have metal.
**Jdawson**: But honestly, like, it's hard for me to tell you what we're gonna do because I really, I.
**Jdawson**: In my head, I know what we're gonna do, but we.
**Jdawson**: We need to price it out and make sure it works within the budget parameters that is being provided for this project.
**Jdawson**: So that's why, like, once I get the model, we're going to materialize, we're going to do takeoffs, we're going to do our budget really fast to make sure that we're operating within your guidelines.
**Jdawson**: So I don't know exactly what we're doing yet.
**Bclymer**: So from our budget standpoint, it would be beneficial to not tile all those bulkheads, obviously.
**Bclymer**: And then probably this, this metal wrap around here would be the most cost effective way.
**Bclymer**: We're gonna have to tile the ice cream and the wine bar.
**Bclymer**: I don't think the other two bars get tile anywhere.
**Ashton**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: But the bathroom wet walls would be the only other areas to get tile.
**Ashton**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And it seems like these bathrooms are smaller than what we have in the other one.
**Jdawson**: It's a cool setup.
**Jdawson**: I like it.
**Bclymer**: There's a beer wall that's gonna be on this wall here.
**Jdawson**: Oh, the beer wall is going there.
**Bclymer**: The beer walls going here.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So we made this.
**Bclymer**: We made this wall wider.
**Bclymer**: We had to add a column right here.
**Bclymer**: But we made this wall wider and moved this column over so we could fit.
**Bclymer**: I don't remember.
**Bclymer**: I want to see maybe the 30.
**Bclymer**: 30 taps or something like that.
**Bclymer**: And then charge by the ounce.
**Bclymer**: Is that what you guys.
**Bclymer**: Did you do that?
**Bclymer**: Liberty too?
**Jdawson**: I think we have 24.
**Jdawson**: Mel, do you remember?
**Bclymer**: But something like that.
**Ashton**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Where are your access panels for all that?
**Jdawson**: Is it just going to be fit right into the wall or are you building out anything in front of it?
**Bclymer**: So this is the wall here.
**Nbigler**: Cool.
**Bclymer**: There'll be.
**Bclymer**: Actually that column's not going to the ceiling.
**Bclymer**: There's just another column there that'll hit hide in that wall.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, you wrap around here, go into the bathroom, and then that wall like I said would be 6 or 8 inch wall.
**Bclymer**: I don't remember what this, what we set that at.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: We have 30.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah, I think two of them were for water.
**Bclymer**: I don't know.
**Bclymer**: I don't the final answer, but okay.
**Bclymer**: I thought I'll figure it out hearing that, but maybe not.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Okay, now what about.
**Bclymer**: What about the.
**Bclymer**: So you'll set.
**Bclymer**: You'll kind of take this floor plan and put your FF&E boots and all that stuff and place it.
**Jdawson**: Well, I thought that there was already a floor plan that I'm working with.
**Bclymer**: Well, this is the floor plan.
**Bclymer**: But I mean how.
**Jdawson**: I mean the furniture plan.
**Jdawson**: Furniture plan.
**Jdawson**: Isn't there there a page that has a big furniture layout?
**Jdawson**: I'm pretty sure I saw one.
**Bclymer**: If you did, it would have been like a preliminary one way way many revisions ago when we only had a few pages.
**Bclymer**: I don't believe that we have anything like that now.
**Jdawson**: I'll probably start with that and just see what makes the most sense with the assets that we have because the less have to remake and refine, the better, and it'll just help us move a lot quicker.
**Nbigler**: So.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, it's one of the first pages, I think.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, it's all right.
**Bclymer**: I think you're right.
**Jdawson**: I just saw it.
**Jdawson**: I just saw it.
**Bclymer**: Ah, the life safety plan.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Ashton**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So we're probably going to start with some version of this and then.
**Jdawson**: And then play with that.
**Jdawson**: You know, I'm assuming this got approved at some point.
**Jdawson**: So we'll play with our own measurements and the things that we know that we designed and brought over, like from our Chinese vendors.
**Jdawson**: This way we don't have to redesign anything, but we'll.
**Jdawson**: We'll start here and work from there.
**Nbigler**: Perfect.
**Ashton**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Seriously, once I get this model, you're.
**Jdawson**: You're going to be really happy with how quickly we can move?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I, My, my concern right now really is, I guess, mainly the electrical, because they're gonna.
**Bclymer**: They need to get that added into their plan.
**Bclymer**: There's really not going to be anything else that.
**Bclymer**: That messes with.
**Bclymer**: But if we have to do floor boxes, any of that type of stuff, I need to.
**Bclymer**: I need to know that we might.
**Jdawson**: Just need a few.
**Jdawson**: And again, if we're, if we're doing a lot more like freestanding furniture that can all be cleared out versus, you know, in the Liberty Collective space, we did a lot of stuff that's like permanent, like we don' Move stuff.
**Jdawson**: That's why we did so many floor boxes over there for, for different lighting elements.
**Jdawson**: If we're not doing as much of that, we have a lot more flexibility to keep that out of our electrical plant.
**Bclymer**: Would you be intending to put power around the mezzanine?
**Bclymer**: This is the second floor, so would there be power around?
**Jdawson**: Ideally, I, I personally like that from a function standpoint and as like a customer not being able to.
**Jdawson**: Or being able to quickly find a power source for a phone.
**Jdawson**: I mean, this is going to be a daytime operation as well, and I'm assuming that they're going to want people working here during the day.
**Jdawson**: That's what the intent was for Liberty Collective.
**Jdawson**: So that's why we really did prioritize making ample power available throughout the space.
**Jdawson**: So again, once we get into it, we're going to really figure it out.
**Bclymer**: So then all the stuff in the middle, below the open mezzanine, would.
**Bclymer**: You'd either have to get a floor box because there's nothing for a ceiling power to drop down.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, so we'll figure that out.
**Bclymer**: There's nothing there yeah, exactly.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so where.
**Bclymer**: Where we're gonna run the power through the slab here or underneath the mezzanine and pop up through the slab, probably, and then just put a box every eight or ten feet or something.
**Bclymer**: Receptacle.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And we can.
**Jdawson**: We can do a quick electrical plan once we.
**Jdawson**: We get in here, and advice like give that to the electrical team to advise on where we would like power, but they'll tell us what's possible.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so I guess as you're designed, as you talk with Mike, and just this obviously will be a change order for all this electrical.
**Bclymer**: So just as long as he's aware, you know, hey, if we're adding.
**Bclymer**: No problem, 200.
**Bclymer**: 200 of these versus 100 or whatever.
**Nbigler**: If he's.
**Bclymer**: If he's concerned about the cost implications for that portion of it, that's fine.
**Jdawson**: And if we have to cut it back, we'll say.
**Jdawson**: We'll go every other.
**Jdawson**: Or something like that.
**Jdawson**: We'll figure it out to.
**Jdawson**: To make it work, everybody.
**Bclymer**: Okay, So I saw you sent me some of the.
**Bclymer**: What do you call these, bankets.
**Bclymer**: They have those.
**Jdawson**: Those are just sofas.
**Bclymer**: Oh, these are just sofas?
**Ashton**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Do we have any bank ads in this?
**Jdawson**: We do.
**Jdawson**: I saw on one of those other plans that you had there.
**Jdawson**: So, I mean, those are boots there.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, here we go.
**Jdawson**: There's boots.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so you see where it says A2,226 right below where you're.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, this area.
**Jdawson**: So those are banquets, these up here, right?
**Jdawson**: No, no, no.
**Jdawson**: Below.
**Jdawson**: So where it's.
**Jdawson**: Yes, those are banquettes.
**Jdawson**: And then if you look above the first box that you drew, that's it.
**Jdawson**: Based on what I'm understanding, this is drawn as you have three boots on the top, and below that is banquettes right there.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: All right, so if those are going to get power that would need.
**Bclymer**: We'd have to run that in the slab.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: But I think.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I think you'll have.
**Bclymer**: If you have that stuff more.
**Bclymer**: More quickly, then.
**Ashton**: Yeah, well.
**Nbigler**: Perfect.
**Ashton**: Yeah, that's.
**Jdawson**: That's not a problem.
**Nbigler**: We'll get.
**Jdawson**: We'll get on that first.
**Bclymer**: Chad, am I missing anything as far as getting the sequence and getting.
**Bclymer**: Getting the design here from.
**Bclymer**: From Eli, Chad had to step out.
**Gdesmit**: When he comes back in, I will mention something to him.
**Bclymer**: Jesse's on here.
**Bclymer**: Do you have any input on.
**Bclymer**: On any of this, Jesse?
**Brhoades**: Well, definitely.
**Brhoades**: If you're roughing in the slab, you need that like, you know, within a week.
**Brhoades**: I don't know what your time frame is on that layout.
**Jdawson**: Well, I'm just waiting on files.
**Jdawson**: If I get files, we can crank.
**Nbigler**: Okay.
**Brhoades**: And that's the CAD files of this drawing.
**Jdawson**: I'd like CAD files of everything, ideally.
**Jdawson**: And then we're waiting for.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, and then if we're.
**Jdawson**: For all of our visualization, we're waiting on a revit file to be purged so that we can have a shell to work with, which will help us with all of our takeoffs and all of our visualization.
**Brhoades**: Okay, and what is.
**Brhoades**: Does Jeff have both, or is everything his in one of the other?
**Brhoades**: Glenn.
**Nbigler**: He.
**Bclymer**: He has it, but what he means by purging is there's notes and tags all over their model so that he's got to go and make a.
**Bclymer**: Make a version of that that takes all those internal tags and notes and stuff that they were using for their design so that Eli can have a fresh model.
**Bclymer**: Because eli only does 3D models off of it.
**Bclymer**: That's why you need.
**Bclymer**: What the.
**Bclymer**: Is it revit for you?
**Jdawson**: We.
**Jdawson**: We don't use revit, but we.
**Ashton**: We.
**Jdawson**: We take it and we put it into SketchUp, and that's how we do all of our visualization for our designs.
**Ashton**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: You're not talking about it mixed up.
**Bclymer**: Which ones do which.
**Brhoades**: The entire set of drawing.
**Brhoades**: You don't need the entire set of drawings.
**Brhoades**: You just need the floor.
**Jdawson**: I mean, I don't need, like, little section cuts of wall finishes or.
**Nbigler**: Or walls.
**Bclymer**: Wall.
**Jdawson**: I don't know.
**Jdawson**: Anatomy of a wall.
**Jdawson**: I just need, like, to understand, okay, where is the power currently?
**Jdawson**: Where is the lighting currently?
**Jdawson**: An H VAC plan and a plumbing plan are always helpful just so I can understand where everything is.
**Jdawson**: It helps me understand the anatomy of the building, but that's.
**Jdawson**: That's all that I need.
**Jdawson**: I don't need all of your code analysis and whatnot.
**Brhoades**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, Jeff.
**Bclymer**: Jeff was working on that.
**Brhoades**: And when is he gonna have that done?
**Bclymer**: He said yesterday, and I was expecting him to be on this meeting today.
**Brhoades**: So can you send him a message and ask him where he's at?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I just tried to invite him to this meeting while we were on it.
**Bclymer**: He's not on the invite for some reason, but he always has been.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Brhoades**: Are you doing anything?
**Brhoades**: Are you also doing stuff on the patios?
**Jdawson**: Are you talking to me?
**Jdawson**: Sorry.
**Brhoades**: Yeah, the design.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Brhoades**: Anything out of the patio?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we'll do.
**Jdawson**: We'll do furniture layout, and if there's any specific light.
**Jdawson**: Like, we didn't do any particularly specific lighting out there, but we did furniture Layout and selection.
**Bclymer**: Are you jumping on the design coordinates?
**Bclymer**: Meeting.
**Brhoades**: Okay.
**Ashton**: Yeah.
**Brhoades**: And then have you seen all, like, we've selected some of the exterior finishes.
**Brhoades**: They got the.
**Brhoades**: The split face block, and I think.
**Jdawson**: We need to assume that we haven't seen anything.
**Jdawson**: I've seen some of the older renderings and I saw some exterior renderings, but.
**Nbigler**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay, cool.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, this looks great.
**Jdawson**: Oh, that's what you're doing there.
**Nbigler**: Okay, cool.
**Jdawson**: I like these arches a lot more.
**Bclymer**: Up in these EFIs arches here.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, these are.
**Jdawson**: I like this type of arch versus the one that we did at the other space.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, this looks great, guys.
**Bclymer**: It's gonna be pretty cool.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we're excited to sink our teeth into it.
**Jdawson**: Do you guys have plans for the new bathrooms?
**Bclymer**: Yep, they're.
**Bclymer**: They're in here.
**Bclymer**: Do you.
**Bclymer**: Do you not have this set of plans at all?
**Bclymer**: Hila.
**Jdawson**: I don't think so.
**Jdawson**: The last set of plans that I looked at, there were no.
**Jdawson**: Like, we had met with Katie about the ibeach space, and there were no bathrooms in those drawings.
**Nbigler**: Oh, okay.
**Jdawson**: There they are.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So we added them here.
**Bclymer**: We tucked them into this corner.
**Nbigler**: Cool.
**Bclymer**: And then we moved the door over here, added two doors.
**Bclymer**: This looks great, guys.
**Jdawson**: And can you pan down?
**Jdawson**: She had mentioned.
**Jdawson**: Melissa, help me out here.
**Jdawson**: She had mentioned something about there being a big covered patio down there a little further.
**Bclymer**: No, all the patio wraps the north and the west side.
**Bclymer**: All of that is patio.
**Bclymer**: So this.
**Bclymer**: This staircase is open.
**Bclymer**: So the patio kind of jigs over here.
**Bclymer**: Let me.
**Bclymer**: Let's.
**Bclymer**: I can show you back on the elevation.
**Jdawson**: That'd be great.
**Awoodhams**: Remember Katie saying was it was on the north end.
**Jdawson**: Oh, okay.
**Jdawson**: Because she's.
**Ashton**: What?
**Jdawson**: She's having us design stuff on the south side.
**Brhoades**: There's only the little.
**Bclymer**: All we have is this little pat awning and doors right here.
**Bclymer**: But there's not going to be any room for.
**Bclymer**: For anything right there.
**Jdawson**: All right, I gotta connect with her again.
**Jdawson**: And because she was pointing out, she's like, we're trying to do all this stuff over here.
**Jdawson**: And I was like, okay, I.
**Jdawson**: There was nothing on the drawing.
**Jdawson**: So I was like, all right, just tell me what.
**Jdawson**: What you're trying to do.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I mean, this.
**Bclymer**: We got our underground.
**Bclymer**: We'll have our transformer box sitting.
**Bclymer**: This is that door.
**Bclymer**: We were just looking at our grease trap.
**Bclymer**: And some clean outs are going to be right here.
**Bclymer**: I think there's four.
**Bclymer**: Four clean outs.
**Bclymer**: And then we have our trans.
**Bclymer**: Our transformer here.
**Bclymer**: Everything else is.
**Jdawson**: What is she trying to put here.
**Bclymer**: I don't.
**Bclymer**: I don't know, because this is all.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I haven't seen a lot of this stuff.
**Bclymer**: It's turf, grass, and some trees out here as well, is what it's going to be.
**Jdawson**: Oh, it's.
**Nbigler**: Oh.
**Jdawson**: I mean, maybe she's just trying to put some like.
**Jdawson**: Like Adirondacks or something out here for people to chill.
**Jdawson**: I don't know.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, this is what.
**Bclymer**: Whatever you're saying is the first I've heard about it.
**Bclymer**: We.
**Bclymer**: I've had no.
**Bclymer**: I have no plans to do anything on the south side as far as a patio or anything like that goes.
**Awoodhams**: I don't remember anything on the south.
**Awoodhams**: So we will look at our meeting notes from Katie and we'll talk to.
**Ashton**: Okay.
**Awoodhams**: We're not missing anything, but I have.
**Bclymer**: A question I can send you.
**Bclymer**: I mean, this is the civil plans with the landscaping plan on it.
**Jdawson**: That would be awesome.
**Ashton**: Please send us.
**Bclymer**: And send you everything.
**Jdawson**: Anything and everything you can send us just helps us get a better.
**Jdawson**: I mean, we're coming into this so late, so anything you could send us is going to help us out.
**Bclymer**: All right, I have.
**Bclymer**: I have everything.
**Bclymer**: So I'll send you all of them.
**Bclymer**: I know the IFC set is going to be updated and he'll get you the model, but I have everything.
**Bclymer**: Otherwise, I do not have CAD drawings for any of the MEPs.
**Bclymer**: No, I don't have that.
**Bclymer**: Do you need those?
**Bclymer**: I can request.
**Jdawson**: I mean, it would be really helpful just so that we can work right over them.
**Bclymer**: Do you want to make sure that.
**Jdawson**: There are no discrepancies?
**Bclymer**: What is the word that I ask for?
**Bclymer**: Just ask them for their models.
**Jdawson**: You can.
**Jdawson**: You can ask for the CAD file.
**Jdawson**: You can ask for a dwg.
**Jdawson**: Mel, do you have anything else you'd want to potentially ask for?
**Awoodhams**: No, I think the.
**Awoodhams**: I think just the MEP CAD files are fine.
**Ashton**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Awoodhams**: And then that life safety plan that's on this one would be very helpful, the CAD plan for that.
**Awoodhams**: Because then we can kind of work around the furniture that's there and see what the sizing is and make sure that.
**Awoodhams**: But that's still the plan.
**Jdawson**: Cool.
**Bclymer**: You turn your mic up, Melissa couldn't hear you very well.
**Awoodhams**: Oh, sorry.
**Awoodhams**: Can you hear me better now?
**Jdawson**: I don't know.
**Bclymer**: Eli probably came with a headphones in, but yeah, I don't.
**Nbigler**: Oh, good.
**Jdawson**: And we could also get a little email out and just say, hey, this is exactly what we're looking for, if that helps.
**Nbigler**: No, I'll.
**Bclymer**: I'll send an email with all of this, and I'll CC okay the correct people and get them to reply each with their.
**Bclymer**: With their CAD files to that.
**Jdawson**: All right, thank you.
**Bclymer**: But I'll send you all the drawings at least.
**Jdawson**: That would be great.
**Awoodhams**: Can you hear me better now, by chance?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, actually, I think it sounds better.
**Bclymer**: Not.
**Bclymer**: Not really.
**Jdawson**: Not for you.
**Nbigler**: No.
**Brhoades**: Just.
**Brhoades**: Just pretend you've known Glenn for like, six months, and everything you say, well, you'll be yelling at him, so.
**Gdesmit**: Got it.
**Awoodhams**: Can you hear me now?
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: There we go.
**Bclymer**: Okay, none of this has anything to do with you guys.
**Bclymer**: Design deliverables.
**Bclymer**: I guess I should probably add you guys on here now.
**Nbigler**: Okay.
**Nbigler**: All right.
**Bclymer**: Assuming you have your models by the end of the week, from Jeff that he told you he'd get you this week.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, if we can get them tomorrow, that'd be amazing because we could start on those probably Monday, Tuesday, and just start cranking because next week.
**Jdawson**: Let's look at this.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we can block out some big chunks of time for this next week to really get caught up.
**Nbigler**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: When.
**Bclymer**: What Next week is the second week of the second.
**Nbigler**: What.
**Bclymer**: What would be the delivery deliverable date that you guys would have your.
**Bclymer**: Your drawings down back to us?
**Jdawson**: I mean, we can definitely get to, you know, the electrical box layout.
**Jdawson**: I'll have to get that approved by Mike, but that'll be pretty quick for us.
**Jdawson**: And I can have that submitted to you by the end of the week next week.
**Jdawson**: That's the only real thing that would be holding anything up currently.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Because once we get through that layout, we can go in and start populating this model and start doing our design work within there.
**Jdawson**: And then we can begin our elevations, our takeoffs, and make sure that we're aligned.
**Jdawson**: That'll probably be the following week.
**Bclymer**: Oh, so just want just two weeks to do all of this?
**Jdawson**: Not all of it, but that's just how I'm getting.
**Jdawson**: That's my quick timeline.
**Jdawson**: I'm seeing that you guys want this done by the end of June.
**Bclymer**: I mean, I.
**Bclymer**: I just heard two weeks, so I'm good with that.
**Jdawson**: No, you didn't hear two weeks.
**Jdawson**: Get out of here, Glenn.
**Jdawson**: No, I saw.
**Jdawson**: I.
**Jdawson**: If you guys are trying to get design wrapped up by the end of June, I think that that's fair.
**Jdawson**: We'll have some level of deliverables in two weeks for everybody to discuss.
**Jdawson**: And then from there, it's tweaking, revising, and dialing it in for end of June.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so if I put the 26th that is giving you.
**Bclymer**: That's giving you next week.
**Bclymer**: That's four weeks.
**Nbigler**: That's.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah, give us four weeks.
**Jdawson**: Let's see how we get.
**Bclymer**: Get there with the electricals and then three more weeks.
**Bclymer**: That's the 26.
**Bclymer**: That'll be this meeting in four weeks or five weeks or whenever that is.
**Nbigler**: All right.
**Bclymer**: Five.
**Bclymer**: 26 is the date.
**Bclymer**: We'll track for that.
**Nbigler**: I don't.
**Bclymer**: I don't foresee that being an issue, especially if we can check in at the two week mark and kind of.
**Jdawson**: That's what I'm saying.
**Bclymer**: Figure out where some of those finishes are going, because that.
**Bclymer**: That's really all I need for to.
**Bclymer**: To finish my buyout.
**Bclymer**: And hopefully the IFC drawings are supposed to call that out, but if we're going to change that, you know, put tile from here, you know, the bulkheads and not.
**Bclymer**: And put it down low and take the metal out and that changes afterwards, that's going to have implications on.
**Bclymer**: On me for getting this contract, getting all.
**Jdawson**: For sure.
**Bclymer**: So these finishes are kind of the last thing I have to do.
**Bclymer**: And everybody's been working with us and pricing it as we go and as the design develops so they're ready to.
**Bclymer**: We're ready to contract and start getting stuff ordered quickly.
**Nbigler**: Awesome.
**Ashton**: Yeah, we.
**Jdawson**: We don't want to hold you up.
**Jdawson**: So the quicker we get what we need, the quicker we can get you what you need.
**Nbigler**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right, well, we'll keep going.
**Bclymer**: Electrical is priority, and other than that, I think we're good.
**Bclymer**: I know you have a.
**Bclymer**: 30 minutes is what I told you.
**Bclymer**: These things usually take.
**Bclymer**: So we'll cut it off and.
**Bclymer**: Good.
**Bclymer**: Jesse, you got anything else that we need to hit today?
**Bclymer**: Eli?
**Bclymer**: I'm good.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right, guys.
**Bclymer**: Thanks for your time.
**Bclymer**: Eli, you're still a point of contact.
**Bclymer**: You passing this off to these quiet girls?
**Jdawson**: No, it's.
**Jdawson**: It's just me.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Nbigler**: All right.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Jdawson**: Make sure that.
**Jdawson**: That Kenzie and Melissa are included on all communication, though.
**Jdawson**: But I am the appointment.
**Nbigler**: All right.
**Bclymer**: I need their.
**Bclymer**: I saw you send them an email, but I didn't get their email address.
**Ashton**: All right.
**Jdawson**: I added them to the.
**Jdawson**: To the invite as well, but mine is e damn good interior, Melissa is m at damn good interiors, and Kenzie is K at damn good interiors.
**Jdawson**: Easy enough.
**Bclymer**: I'll put you guys in job planner and get you access to job planner too.
**Jdawson**: All right, awesome.
**Jdawson**: Thank you.
**Brhoades**: Eli, where are you guys based out of?
**Jdawson**: We're in Denver.
**Brhoades**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And so request to move these back a little bit, you know.
**Brhoades**: Ah, I gotcha.
**Brhoades**: Yeah we got one client that's from Japan so they want their meetings to start at 5:30 in the afternoon.
**Brhoades**: It's.
**Brhoades**: It's crazy.
**Jdawson**: That's not even the afternoon, that's the evening man.
**Jdawson**: Like yeah, outside of business hours.
**Brhoades**: Yeah I think it's like their mornings or something.
**Brhoades**: I don't know probably yeah.
**Bclymer**: God.
**Awoodhams**: Still work at a Japanese company and so the only time we could have meetings with them is late at night.
**Jdawson**: Oh brutal.
**Brhoades**: But they make us do saki shots before we get started so I don't mind that.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, no that sounds like a great way to kick off a meeting.
**Jdawson**: The Japanese are just better at everything.
**Jdawson**: That's how it goes.
**Jdawson**: They understand.
**Bclymer**: Yeah who was the other?
**Bclymer**: Who was it Milton Bliss and was it Kenzie?
**Jdawson**: Kenzie.
**Brhoades**: All right, excellent.
**Brhoades**: Thanks everybody.
**Nbigler**: Thank you guys.
**Jdawson**: All right thank you everyone.
**Gdesmit**: Talk soon.
**Bclymer**: See you.
