## Transcript
**Ataylor**: Hey, guys.
**Jdawson**: Howdy.
**Jdawson**: Howdy.
**Bclymer**: I'm traveling, so I don't really have anything.
**Bclymer**: So, I mean, if you.
**Bclymer**: You guys can talk through whatever you want to talk through, but I'm probably just gonna drop.
**Bclymer**: But I was at least just hopping on to tell you that the only.
**Jdawson**: Only thing I have is I just received notice and I forwarded to you Steve and Steve that Alito is coming on Thursday to inspect the roof.
**Jdawson**: Or not.
**Jdawson**: Alito.
**Jdawson**: I'm sorry.
**Speaker 3**: Real.
**Jdawson**: Real ops.
**Ataylor**: Okay, cool.
**Bclymer**: Sound.
**Speaker 3**: Should we complain to him about the leaks?
**Jdawson**: Well, that's what.
**Jdawson**: That's what we'll do when they're here.
**Bclymer**: All right, I'm gonna hop.
**Ataylor**: I'll catch up with you guys.
**Jdawson**: Well, Jesse, I really don't have anything.
**Speaker 4**: Hey, sorry, Eric.
**Speaker 4**: I was muted there, so we don't have.
**Speaker 4**: AJ's not in here.
**Speaker 4**: Okay.
**Speaker 4**: I thought AJ was in here.
**Speaker 4**: Was there anything you need from us?
**Speaker 4**: I know AJ said that the fence.
**Speaker 4**: They were finishing up the gate.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, you know, the.
**Jdawson**: The gate.
**Speaker 5**: Hey, sorry, guys.
**Speaker 5**: I had to.
**Speaker 5**: I was talking to Mid south, actually, just now, so I don't think we.
**Jdawson**: Have any issues with the gate.
**Jdawson**: You know, we haven't moved forward with anything with the truck gate guard shack, so, you know, I haven't seen any.
**Jdawson**: I never ran into.
**Jdawson**: Nobody announced themselves to me, AJ as a.
**Jdawson**: As the handyman or the.
**Jdawson**: The dude that was going to cut a window into it.
**Speaker 5**: Yeah, so they were.
**Speaker 5**: They.
**Speaker 5**: They said it permanently yesterday, Eric.
**Jdawson**: They did?
**Speaker 5**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: It'd be nice whenever they.
**Jdawson**: Anybody does something, like let Steve or I know so we could I.
**Speaker 5**: On.
**Speaker 5**: On our.
**Speaker 5**: I'm sorry.
**Speaker 5**: On our call last week, I.
**Speaker 5**: I had mentioned that they were going to come by to do it, so that's.
**Speaker 5**: Yeah, I'll make sure I get it in writing.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Just which day.
**Jdawson**: It'd be nice that we could have known they were here.
**Speaker 5**: Well, yeah, I'll.
**Speaker 5**: I'll make sure I put it in writing for you.
**Speaker 5**: That way, it's.
**Speaker 4**: I mean, don't they.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, but I mean, like.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, they should have to check.
**Jdawson**: And I.
**Jdawson**: And I.
**Jdawson**: To be honest, I'm going to bark at the guard about this, but.
**Speaker 5**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Like, the guard should let us know that they're here, but.
**Jdawson**: They should.
**Jdawson**: Maybe that's the solution.
**Jdawson**: I just will tell the guard no vendors or.
**Speaker 6**: The solution is that.
**Speaker 6**: That we'll make sure to update you anytime somebody's on site.
**Speaker 6**: So, I mean, AJ can send a text to you or Steve or whoever, just to be clear.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And I'll make sure the Guards don't let people just through the gate.
**Jdawson**: That's on them, too.
**Speaker 5**: Yeah, I apologize there.
**Speaker 5**: So.
**Speaker 5**: So they did set it permanently.
**Speaker 5**: Mid south will be there in the morning to finish up.
**Speaker 5**: As far as the cutting the window in.
**Speaker 5**: Eric, I.
**Speaker 5**: I need any specs you have on that guard shack because those.
**Speaker 5**: Those windows they have are specially built for the guard shack.
**Speaker 5**: So if you can send me that, I'll get with the manufacturer and we'll get a window ordered and cut it in.
**Jdawson**: I don't know if any.
**Jdawson**: What spec.
**Jdawson**: I don't have any specs.
**Jdawson**: Like, I don't.
**Speaker 5**: Do you know who.
**Speaker 5**: Who ordered it?
**Jdawson**: I.
**Jdawson**: Well, reach out to Fisher, but.
**Speaker 5**: Okay.
**Speaker 3**: Don order that guard shack.
**Speaker 3**: Somehow or another.
**Speaker 3**: I remember her saying she ordered it.
**Speaker 5**: It's either him or I thought Todd maybe.
**Jdawson**: You know what?
**Jdawson**: I'll reach out to Todd.
**Jdawson**: That's probably a better.
**Speaker 5**: And I'm.
**Jdawson**: Guard sack's been here for a couple of years, so it's long before I was born on the cart.
**Speaker 5**: Right.
**Speaker 5**: I'm happy to reach out to Todd myself and ask him for it because if we order the window through whoever the guard shack manufacturer is, that would be much easier.
**Speaker 5**: So we'll get that ordered and we'll.
**Speaker 5**: And we'll have Doug's guys cut it in.
**Speaker 3**: I'll go out there and check inside the guard.
**Speaker 3**: Check and see if I can see any labels or a model number or anything.
**Speaker 3**: I'll let you know, A.J.
**Speaker 5**: All right, thanks, Steve.
**Speaker 4**: So the electricians, they run, they finish with their power out to it.
**Speaker 5**: They'll finish tomorrow, Jesse.
**Speaker 5**: Or tomorrow or Thursday.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, I think they were just waiting on the.
**Speaker 3**: To be set in its final spot.
**Speaker 3**: And they just had the short distance to connect it to the.
**Speaker 3**: To the guard shack.
**Speaker 5**: Yep.
**Speaker 5**: Yeah, everything's ran.
**Speaker 5**: We were just waiting to get it set permanently.
**Jdawson**: Good.
**Jdawson**: Eric.
**Speaker 5**: The only other open item I have is.
**Speaker 5**: Is the guardrail.
**Speaker 5**: I'm going to send you a submittal for it.
**Speaker 5**: They're supposed to have it to me today, so I spoke with Doug this morning, and I'll.
**Speaker 5**: I'll send you a submittal to make sure it's what you want, and then they'll get it ordered and probably installed next week.
**Speaker 5**: Okay, perfect.
**Speaker 4**: So how's the coolers running these days?
**Jdawson**: They're still running and we haven't had any change.
**Jdawson**: We're seeing a little bit of increase in the temperature of them from, you know, we're running into a little bit more heat and humidity as the day is getting warmer.
**Jdawson**: I would say humidity, you Know, in general.
**Speaker 4**: What is the temps there lately?
**Jdawson**: Well, today it's a little chilly, but last week we.
**Jdawson**: We were in the 70s, and it was humid.
**Jdawson**: We had all those.
**Jdawson**: Those storms that, you know, we got.
**Jdawson**: I think we got 11 inches of rain in four days.
**Speaker 4**: Geez.
**Jdawson**: I don't know if that made it all the way up to Indiana.
**Jdawson**: Indiana.
**Speaker 6**: But.
**Speaker 4**: Yeah.
**Speaker 4**: So you could notice a difference in the amount of condensate coming out of them.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Where we didn't see much all winter, but now it seems to be a little more on the floor.
**Speaker 4**: Yep.
**Speaker 4**: I don't know, AJ Is there anything else?
**Speaker 4**: Was.
**Speaker 4**: Was Steve gonna.
**Speaker 4**: Fisher.
**Speaker 4**: Was he joined in today or.
**Speaker 4**: He's not.
**Speaker 5**: No.
**Speaker 5**: I know where.
**Speaker 5**: Where we left it last week is.
**Speaker 5**: You know, they've.
**Speaker 5**: They've taken our proposal and submitted it as a part of the package with real op to see how much ti dollars they're gonna get.
**Speaker 5**: So once we know that, we'll get our release.
**Speaker 5**: That's all I got.
**Speaker 4**: Right.
**Speaker 4**: Is there anything you guys need from us?
**Speaker 3**: No.
**Speaker 3**: I'll text your or met.
**Speaker 3**: I'll send an email to you, AJ about when I find out there.
**Speaker 3**: That shack.
**Speaker 5**: Yeah.
**Speaker 5**: Yeah, that works.
**Speaker 5**: I know.
**Speaker 5**: I know.
**Speaker 5**: Doug looked in there and.
**Speaker 5**: And he couldn't find anything.
**Speaker 3**: Okay.
**Speaker 5**: But I'll, like.
**Speaker 5**: I'll shoot.
**Speaker 5**: I'll shoot Todd a text and ask him to send me the.
**Speaker 5**: The specs on it, and I'll.
**Speaker 5**: I'll call the.
**Speaker 5**: The company and order a window.
**Speaker 3**: The windows are only.
**Speaker 3**: I think the walls are only like 2 inches thick or an inch and a half thick.
**Speaker 5**: Correct.
**Speaker 5**: Yeah.
**Speaker 5**: So if they don't sell windows individually, I'll have to find something that will fit that wall thickness.
**Speaker 3**: Well, you can.
**Speaker 3**: You can.
**Speaker 3**: You can get a window, an aluminum window that just mounts from the outside.
**Speaker 3**: Surface mount window.
**Speaker 3**: I don't know what we'll do about the nastiness of the cut.
**Speaker 3**: From the inside.
**Speaker 5**: We can put some sort of coping or like a.
**Speaker 5**: Yeah, just get some.
**Speaker 3**: Bent sheet metal and go around it.
**Speaker 5**: Yeah, we'll figure something out.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: Probably could do it with drip edge.
**Speaker 5**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: Maybe like brick molding.
**Speaker 3**: Drip edge brick with that stuff they put.
**Speaker 3**: They call it Z molding or something like that.
**Speaker 5**: Z flash.
**Speaker 3**: Z flashing.
**Speaker 3**: That's it.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, we'll.
**Speaker 5**: We'll come up with something.
**Speaker 3**: All right, well, I'll see you fellas.
**Speaker 5**: All right, thanks, guys.
**Ataylor**: Thanks.
**Speaker 4**: All right, thanks.
