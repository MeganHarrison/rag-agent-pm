**Ehillyer**: So we're infilling these finish plan fo6.
**Ehillyer**: I think that's the plywood.
**Mcordray**: So on the on e200 page there at the top, it talks about existing cardboard crusher power to be relocated.

**Ehillyer**: So on the.
**Ehillyer**: So just open up the sitewalk plan.
**Ehillyer**: We'll go through it and compare everything that went on here.
**Ehillyer**: So this swap in the break room office.
**Ehillyer**: And reducing the office dimension.
**Ehillyer**: We, you know, used to have this, but that column was out here in the middle of the room.
**Ehillyer**: So architecture has picked it up.
**Ehillyer**: And this will be your office now, Andrew.
**Ehillyer**: And you, you wanted this counter like an L.
**Ehillyer**: Like this.
**Jriddle**: Yeah, that works.
**Shoff**: Okay.
**Ehillyer**: And it looks like they just made this.
**Ehillyer**: A little break room.
**Ehillyer**: Sink with the upper cabinets here and then vending and refrigerator over here.
**Ehillyer**: Does that look right to you or usually they're.
**Jriddle**: That'll be on the same wall as the sink.
**Ehillyer**: Okay.
**Jriddle**: The vending and refrigerator.
**Ehillyer**: This one will move.
**Ehillyer**: Move it between and face them all out.
**Jriddle**: Yep.
**Ehillyer**: It's good.
**Ehillyer**: It gives you a nice big break room.
**Ehillyer**: Then this will have an ice maker in it.
**Jriddle**: Nope, just a fridge.
**Ehillyer**: Well, not just bridge.
**Shoff**: Okay.
**Ehillyer**: And if we look here at the plumbing update, they've got the office over here now the sink here.
**Ehillyer**: So we'll have the same comment.
**Shoff**: But.
**Ehillyer**: It shouldn't affect these guys just electrically.
**Ehillyer**: Where is that Electrical updates.
**Ehillyer**: Make sure they put the power for that fridge.
**Ehillyer**: Get that moved over.
**Ehillyer**: But the electrical.
**Ehillyer**: They updated it too.
**Ehillyer**: They got some outlets.
**Ehillyer**: Looks like here above counter.
**Ehillyer**: Is that the way you wanted them?
**Jriddle**: Yep.
**Jriddle**: That looks good.
**Ehillyer**: Two of them enough?
**Jriddle**: Yep.
**Ehillyer**: That should be fine here.
**Jriddle**: Yep.
**Shoff**: Okay.
**Ehillyer**: And then just the two outlets on the wall in the break room.
**Jriddle**: Yeah, that'll be fun.
**Ehillyer**: I believe this is the power to your time clock.
**Jriddle**: Correct.
**Shoff**: Okay.
**Jriddle**: Is there a different data plan or is that going to have all the data on there as well?
**Ehillyer**: I believe.
**Ehillyer**: Let's see.
**Ehillyer**: Yeah, it would be on here.
**Jriddle**: We add them to all the receptacles by the countertops and the offices.
**Shoff**: Okay.
**Ehillyer**: Because they showed the data here.
**Ehillyer**: We got power data.
**Ehillyer**: Power data.
**Ehillyer**: So just some in here.
**Ehillyer**: Is this like a tv?
**Ehillyer**: I'm guessing.
**Jriddle**: No.
**Jriddle**: I don't know what that is actually.
**Ehillyer**: Lasting that.
**Ehillyer**: You don't plan on putting a monitor or wall TV?
**Jriddle**: We don't need one at.
**Jriddle**: Especially at 60 inches.
**Shoff**: Okay.
**Ehillyer**: We got just one power outlet back here in the dock.
**Ehillyer**: Got that up 60 inches.
**Jriddle**: Can you put that on the wall with the door open?
**Jriddle**: Yeah.
**Jriddle**: They'll use that for a swinging light.
**Ehillyer**: But the height is.
**Ehillyer**: Is good.
**Jriddle**: Yeah, it's fine.
**Ehillyer**: I show these here.
**Ehillyer**: But this.
**Ehillyer**: Is this not correct.
**Ehillyer**: All these panels are inside the closet?
**Jriddle**: Yeah.
**Ehillyer**: So let's get rid of that.
**Mcordray**: This 42 inches too.
**Mcordray**: On the markups, it says we'll.
**Mcordray**: It's got an arrow pointing it saying will not be needed for it.
**Mcordray**: Room on the markups?
**Ehillyer**: Yeah.
**Shoff**: Okay.
**Ehillyer**: We all know this roof access ladder moved.
**Ehillyer**: Which architecture?
**Ehillyer**: It's kind of.
**Ehillyer**: Don't show it.
**Ehillyer**: We had the water heater platform right over here, you know, up off the floor.
**Ehillyer**: So we'll just coordinate those two locations.
**Ehillyer**: All right.
**Ehillyer**: I don't know, Andrew.
**Ehillyer**: Is it easier for you just to go back and forth between what we marked up and then.
**Shoff**: Okay.
**Ehillyer**: So that was our first page here.
**Ehillyer**: And then we had remove exit doors at entrance, if possible.
**Ehillyer**: Yeah, we did that.
**Ehillyer**: So we show these here now inside.
**Ehillyer**: I just pulled a note here.
**Ehillyer**: Actually didn't call out the walls to be full height on the inside that I could see.
**Ehillyer**: So we'll make sure they do that on the demo plan.
**Ehillyer**: They got the.
**Ehillyer**: And show the demo of it.
**Ehillyer**: And then notes to fix the ethos 16.
**Ehillyer**: Putting the new.
**Ehillyer**: This.
**Ehillyer**: We're.
**Ehillyer**: We're redoing the epis where the signage was.
**Ehillyer**: And that metal panel.
**Ehillyer**: We're getting rid of all that.
**Ehillyer**: Oh, we got that moved in taking out the heater and the lights and all that.
**Ehillyer**: That was in there before.
**Ehillyer**: New plan at the vestibule.
**Ehillyer**: They got a little background noise there that isn't cleaned up yet.
**Ehillyer**: And then put two new lights in that vestibule.
**Ehillyer**: We gotta clean this up.
**Shoff**: Okay.
**Ehillyer**: That was that Note.
**Ehillyer**: We had 4x4 angle painted safety or no remove parking.
**Ehillyer**: So here they show them they're X and out all these parking spaces.
**Shoff**: On.
**Ehillyer**: The new civil plan.
**Ehillyer**: Then the new plan.
**Ehillyer**: Here's your new striping plan.
**Ehillyer**: Get rid of all these.
**Ehillyer**: And this too is the new location of the canopy.
**Ehillyer**: Pushback used to be closer to here.
**Ehillyer**: Next we had 4x4 angle painted safety yellow.
**Ehillyer**: The new plan, it's got this A22 note that's on the CMU.
**Ehillyer**: That's.
**Ehillyer**: Let's see.
**Ehillyer**: Structural.
**Ehillyer**: I seen that note.
**Ehillyer**: I think we always had that in the back everywhere.
**Ehillyer**: So that really doesn't affect what we're doing elsewhere.
**Ehillyer**: But we got all these infill and then we put on there.
**Ehillyer**: You know, like we talk when we.
**Ehillyer**: We were there.
**Ehillyer**: Everywhere there's everywhere.
**Ehillyer**: There's the plywood we're going to.
**Ehillyer**: Or these areas here were already infilled where openings used to be.
**Ehillyer**: Those will be plywood as well.
**Ehillyer**: Answer fo6 4x4 angle.
**Ehillyer**: Save the yellow.
**Ehillyer**: They've got that around the entirety of this room.
**Ehillyer**: I don't imagine it's just out in this room.
**Ehillyer**: You don't need it inside the vestibule.
**Jriddle**: Right?
**Jriddle**: Just on the outside of it.
**Ehillyer**: Okay, I got it everywhere.
**Ehillyer**: They don't show it back in.
**Ehillyer**: Back around these offices.
**Ehillyer**: Let's see.
**Ehillyer**: It ends at this door.
**Ehillyer**: Is that.
**Ehillyer**: Does it need to be on these?
**Jriddle**: Yeah, I don't think it needs to be on there.
**Jriddle**: We used to put it on there, but it became more of a tripping hazard than a.
**Jriddle**: Yeah.
**Shoff**: Okay.
**Ehillyer**: Other note here.
**Ehillyer**: L shaped countertops and offices.
**Ehillyer**: We've changed the layout a little bit.
**Ehillyer**: But you've got L here.
**Ehillyer**: L here.
**Jriddle**: Yep, looks good.
**Shoff**: Okay.
**Ehillyer**: Both vestibule electric heaters here.
**Ehillyer**: Demo plan D24.
**Ehillyer**: Two existing heaters, lights and ceiling in those areas.
**Ehillyer**: So that's all been removed.
**Ehillyer**: That air curtain above donation door right there.
**Ehillyer**: We got the power for the air curtain and then we got that covered.
**Ehillyer**: We got the I.
**Ehillyer**: We got the air curtain in there.
**Ehillyer**: Blue sales floor, black room.
**Ehillyer**: Light switches to back room by office lighting plan.
**Ehillyer**: Here's all the switches.
**Ehillyer**: Now.
**Jriddle**: Can we put those on contactors and only have one switch for sales and one for backroom?
**Shoff**: Okay.
**Ehillyer**: Guess that's Not a word.
**Jriddle**: Yeah, every time I type it too.
**Jriddle**: Doesn't like it.
**Ehillyer**: And do that.
**Ehillyer**: Next comment was remove back room occupancy sensor for lights and add switch by door.
**Ehillyer**: So none of the.
**Ehillyer**: We don't have occupancy sensors back here anymore.
**Ehillyer**: That'll be.
**Ehillyer**: That'll be that one switch that controls all these back here.
**Ehillyer**: Yep, same thing.
**Shoff**: Okay.
**Ehillyer**: That'Ll do these lights as well.
**Ehillyer**: Add three floor.
**Ehillyer**: See drawing.
**Jriddle**: I did give those to you, right?
**Jriddle**: I don't remember if I.
**Ehillyer**: You did.
**Ehillyer**: So we had this one here, this one here, and this one here.
**Shoff**: Perfect.
**Ehillyer**: Right.
**Ehillyer**: Then we have at night lights to sales floor.

**Mcordray**: Are those light blue ones?
**Shoff**: Okay.
**Ehillyer**: Night light.
**Ehillyer**: Night light.
**Ehillyer**: Is that enough, Andrew?
**Jriddle**: Yep, that looks good.
**Ehillyer**: Those three can.
**Ehillyer**: All right.
**Ehillyer**: Next we had have lights in truck dock on photocell.
**Ehillyer**: Here's the photo cell.
**Ehillyer**: These lights control these two here.
**Ehillyer**: Is that.
**Jriddle**: Yeah, it should be fine.
**Ehillyer**: I'm not sure why they're laid out like that.
**Shoff**: But.
**Ehillyer**: I guess all their other lines are straight.
**Ehillyer**: So they just left those straight.
**Shoff**: Okay.
**Ehillyer**: All right.
**Ehillyer**: So takes care of those notes.
**Ehillyer**: We've marked up the ones that doesn't look like they've got here this sheet.
**Ehillyer**: You know, we were looking at doing a platform and all that, but we've removed shut.
**Ehillyer**: Cut this wall as close as we could to these conduits.
**Ehillyer**: Move the ceiling back.
**Ehillyer**: That's the new plate.
**Ehillyer**: You know, we're demoing this wall on the demo plan.
**Ehillyer**: New plan.
**Ehillyer**: This.
**Ehillyer**: She just didn't put the new ladder location on there.
**Ehillyer**: But make sure she adds that we added a note.
**Ehillyer**: Get rid of that electrical.
**Ehillyer**: They should have been power abandoned ahead.
**Ehillyer**: Make sure they note that demo is already mostly done.
**Ehillyer**: Got that.
**Ehillyer**: We noted they took out like they already had this wall out.
**Ehillyer**: They already had all these cabinets here out.
**Ehillyer**: All these cabinets out.
**Ehillyer**: Took them off the drawings.
**Ehillyer**: We got the new location of the door shifting.
**Ehillyer**: It used to be over here.
**Ehillyer**: We were demoing this way.
**Ehillyer**: We'll move the canopy, move the door opening.
**Ehillyer**: All of that now on here.
**Ehillyer**: Door used to be here.
**Ehillyer**: We were coming this way.
**Ehillyer**: Now we're bringing it over here.
**Ehillyer**: It's fixing all these demo notes.
**Ehillyer**: They got all that fixed.
**Ehillyer**: Noted here to receive plywood columns, the patch and skim and walls.
**Ehillyer**: They.
**Ehillyer**: They've already done a lot of that.
**Ehillyer**: Looks like they just pulled it off.
**Ehillyer**: Put new on.
**Ehillyer**: It was easier.
**Ehillyer**: All this demo here and we still had to take all this out.
**Ehillyer**: These walls.
**Ehillyer**: Stoops security gates took them out.
**Ehillyer**: Seen the node on the heaters before.
**Ehillyer**: We don't need that for egress.
**Ehillyer**: So it stayed coming out.
**Ehillyer**: Showed it coming out here.
**Ehillyer**: Then we're going to infill with a split faced.
**Ehillyer**: We got the new, you know the new room.
**Ehillyer**: We got that all shown where it goes to.
**Ehillyer**: I don't know that it matters that they.
**Ehillyer**: But they did put the vestibule back in.
**Ehillyer**: We took that out.
**Ehillyer**: All these adjustments were made.
**Ehillyer**: Move the canopy south.
**Ehillyer**: They made that comment.
**Ehillyer**: See here on the civil.
**Ehillyer**: They extended this down for moving the canopy.
**Ehillyer**: We're taking out a little more sidewalk and tying all this back in.
**Ehillyer**: Remove the parking spaces we looked at earlier.
**Ehillyer**: Shifted the canopy.
**Ehillyer**: Got rid of that vestibule.
**Ehillyer**: Shifted south.
**Ehillyer**: Same thing.
**Ehillyer**: Civil got all this updated the new location there.
**Ehillyer**: Grade elevation plans.
**Ehillyer**: They got these updated canopy.
**Ehillyer**: Moving on the structural plan.
**Ehillyer**: See here we got this canopy moved down feet.
**Ehillyer**: So that's coordinated.
**Ehillyer**: Moving the canopy down.
**Ehillyer**: Said here moving got all this move down it just changed that one linnel at the dock entrance.
**Ehillyer**: Changed it to an angle or we're cutting the new door in since it's just a veneer.
**Ehillyer**: Nicholas.
**Ehillyer**: Have to see.
**Shoff**: Two.
**Ehillyer**: It looks like they didn't move.
**Ehillyer**: Make sure they note that all these things move the canopy.
**Ehillyer**: We talked about switch these rooms around.
**Ehillyer**: We talked about infill of the cmu.
**Ehillyer**: We've got that on there now.
**Ehillyer**: So this note framed underside of deck.
**Ehillyer**: That's one they didn't get on there yet.
**Ehillyer**: Countertops are changed L shape.
**Ehillyer**: Got that ceiling grid.
**Ehillyer**: It's got the two strong two by two ceiling grid.
**Ehillyer**: Restroom donation vestibule.
**Ehillyer**: It's drywall or.
**Ehillyer**: No, 11 foot off ceiling.
**Jriddle**: Can you make that two by four instead?
**Ehillyer**: Yeah.
**Jriddle**: For.
**Jriddle**: For everything.
**Ehillyer**: And it's a nine foot height.
**Ehillyer**: Good.
**Jriddle**: Nine foot in like offices.
**Jriddle**: What to say restrooms.
**Jriddle**: Yep, that's right.
**Ehillyer**: Okay.
**Shoff**: Okay.
**Ehillyer**: And then back here concrete one.
**Ehillyer**: That's the polished concrete.
**Ehillyer**: Decided to put everywhere just to make cleaning easier.
**Ehillyer**: So that's all these areas.
**Ehillyer**: That was our original budget.
**Ehillyer**: So we just left it in there.
**Shoff**: Okay.
**Ehillyer**: She didn't get the dry.
**Ehillyer**: She left the drywall wrap in there.
**Ehillyer**: So we just put a note on this sheet just to paint the steel for these existing out in the sales area.
**Ehillyer**: That's what you wanted right Andrew?
**Jriddle**: Yep, that's correct.
**Shoff**: Okay.
**Ehillyer**: They looked at the door clearances that everything's fine.
**Ehillyer**: Bird out the wall.
**Ehillyer**: They got this wall for it out now.
**Ehillyer**: Yeah, I believe that that's already framed.
**Ehillyer**: So as soon as we get a permit we're going to rough it in and drywall this Thing pretty quick.
**Jriddle**: Oh yeah.
**Ehillyer**: All right.
**Ehillyer**: See we made this room as small as possible.
**Ehillyer**: That's been done.
**Ehillyer**: Sit right there.
**Ehillyer**: That's really the original wall layout that we went with.
**Ehillyer**: So should be fine in there.
**Ehillyer**: We've moved the slider in.
**Ehillyer**: That's done.
**Ehillyer**: We got the metal angle in everywhere.
**Ehillyer**: That's on Move the vestibule down to here from up here.
**Ehillyer**: And Nick would be running this thing but he's on site today so he's a little.
**Ehillyer**: It challenged this one here and we move this over.
**Ehillyer**: Yeah.
**Ehillyer**: We've done this modification doing here.
**Ehillyer**: We did that swap on those rooms plumbing drawings.
**Ehillyer**: See why didn't.
**Ehillyer**: I don't know.
**Ehillyer**: I thought they sent us the.
**Ehillyer**: We're missing the plumbing drawing.
**Shoff**: For the.
**Ehillyer**: Drains but I know they've got it.
**Ehillyer**: P201 I didn't see in that folder H vac one putting conditioned air back here in the loading dock area.
**Ehillyer**: So that came off of this unit here to run that duct.
**Ehillyer**: Here's the new sanitary Moving the break room and office and said the wrong.
**Ehillyer**: Too many things open now.
**Ehillyer**: So we've got the plumbing drawing for the drains and the water.
**Ehillyer**: Another comment that we addressed with the city and we sent back in.
**Ehillyer**: They wanted to know where the backflow preventer was.
**Ehillyer**: So they put it back here and added that note to relocate existing backflow preventer.
**Ehillyer**: We get that done and then showed they just wanted to see where all this stuff was coming and then note ones to relocate the supply.
**Ehillyer**: So it's over here right now they just have to cut the floor and cut the floor to get it over into that room.
**Ehillyer**: So we got that all addressed.
**Ehillyer**: We got the donation vestibule moved back in.
**Ehillyer**: Fix all this ethus.
**Ehillyer**: Repair that when we take it out.
**Ehillyer**: Here's the data ductwork we looked at in that other area that came off of here and supplied back in here.
**Ehillyer**: This remove this existing heater.
**Ehillyer**: See I think after we discussed that this might get coal back here.
**Ehillyer**: So we.
**Ehillyer**: It was a relatively new unit.
**Ehillyer**: So we're just going to relocate it over here.
**Jriddle**: Yep.
**Jriddle**: That's what I remember.
**Ehillyer**: So that's.
**Ehillyer**: We got that addressed and then this one goes away.
**Ehillyer**: That was over here.
**Ehillyer**: So instead of raising we're going to delete this one.
**Ehillyer**: Fire sprinkler is design.
**Ehillyer**: We got the.
**Ehillyer**: You know we got them raising all this piping up as high as possible.
**Ehillyer**: Looks like it'll be easier to just move it up near or in the bar joist.
**Ehillyer**: So that's been addressed.
**Ehillyer**: And then removing the electric heater.
**Ehillyer**: We Took it off of our new drawings.
**Ehillyer**: No unit heater out here now or in this vestibule.
**Ehillyer**: Took it out.
**Ehillyer**: They're showing the air curtain in there now.
**Ehillyer**: We added.
**Ehillyer**: They needed to put the.
**Ehillyer**: Now they got these notes.
**Jriddle**: Does it show where the thermostat.
**Jriddle**: All the thermostats go?
**Ehillyer**: I think we had them all remote thermostats back here.
**Jriddle**: Perfect.
**Ehillyer**: With temperature sensors.
**Shoff**: Yeah.
**Shoff**: Yep.
**Ehillyer**: Got that.
**Ehillyer**: I think they had them there before.
**Ehillyer**: Yeah.
**Jriddle**: Okay.
**Ehillyer**: This note 2.
**Ehillyer**: Relocate existing thermostat to location shown and then furnish install remote temp sensor.
**Ehillyer**: So we got that addressed and think that's it on this page.
**Ehillyer**: This is one we still need to modify on the architecturals.
**Ehillyer**: This phasing plan towards just the vestibule.
**Ehillyer**: Make sure we get that.
**Ehillyer**: And again, like we talked, once we get our permit, then we'll submit a revision.
**Ehillyer**: So it doesn't hold our permit up at that.
**Ehillyer**: Making that change.
**Ehillyer**: These were.
**Ehillyer**: It's a little different.
**Ehillyer**: Is.
**Jriddle**: Yeah, it's fine, I think.
**Ehillyer**: Well, maybe not.
**Ehillyer**: Yeah, that's right where they show them.
**Ehillyer**: Was there any specific dimensions to these that we'd want to put on there?
**Ehillyer**: Or is it a general.
**Jriddle**: So I'd say not really.
**Jriddle**: Just kind of in those areas.
**Jriddle**: And then a foot off the wall.
**Jriddle**: Because that'll be underneath our.
**Jriddle**: Our racking.
**Ehillyer**: We had 10 inches on there.
**Jriddle**: No, that's fine.
**Ehillyer**: Is that fine?
**Ehillyer**: Okay.
**Jriddle**: Yeah, that's fine.
**Shoff**: Okay.
**Ehillyer**: All right, System.
**Ehillyer**: Got that.
**Ehillyer**: I missed this exit sign here.
**Ehillyer**: We need to add that here.
**Jriddle**: Oh, where are the egress.
**Jriddle**: Are they on the walls?
**Ehillyer**: Let's see.
**Ehillyer**: They're on these columns.
**Jriddle**: Okay.
**Ehillyer**: And then they're on the exterior walls here, here, and like kind of on the perimeter.
**Ehillyer**: And then these down the middle.
**Jriddle**: Can we have them off the walls on the sales floor?
**Jriddle**: Because we have our marketing graphics that'll go up there and it kind of gets in the way of that stuff.
**Jriddle**: So maybe two on each side of the column.
**Ehillyer**: Or they could be hung down from the bar joist.
**Ehillyer**: Possibly.
**Ehillyer**: Let's see what kind of height they need to be.
**Jriddle**: Yeah.
**Jriddle**: The.
**Jriddle**: Trying to remember how tall the bug is.
**Jriddle**: Pretty tall, right?
**Ehillyer**: Yeah, it's like 22ft somewhere around there.
**Jriddle**: Yeah.
**Jriddle**: First option would be just like one on each side of the columns.
**Ehillyer**: Okay.
**Jriddle**: If that's enough for what's needed.
**Ehillyer**: And that's all walls here.
**Jriddle**: Yep.
**Ehillyer**: This goes away.
**Shoff**: Also.
**Ehillyer**: They had the exit.
**Shoff**: Okay.
**Ehillyer**: That.
**Shoff**: Okay.
**Ehillyer**: Anything else on the lighting here, Andrew?
**Jriddle**: No, looks good.
**Shoff**: Okay.
**Ehillyer**: Got all these dimensions.
**Ehillyer**: I think these are all coordinated with your drawings for all this goes.
**Ehillyer**: We got rid of any outlets outside of this area back here.
**Ehillyer**: Just have the two behind here.
**Ehillyer**: That's it.
**Ehillyer**: That's good for you, Andrew.
**Jriddle**: Yep, that's good.
**Shoff**: Okay.
**Ehillyer**: Those are the three night lights.
**Ehillyer**: Move the switches.
**Ehillyer**: Got rid of the occupancy sensors.
**Ehillyer**: Change this light layout photocell we added back there.
**Ehillyer**: We added the dock leveler.
**Ehillyer**: Rough in relocate power to the dock level IT room.
**Ehillyer**: It's got the plywood backboard extending to deck.
**Ehillyer**: We got plywood extending to deck in the IT room.
**Jriddle**: I don't know if we need that.
**Ehillyer**: People try to break into your IT closet.
**Shoff**: Yeah.
**Ehillyer**: So just eight foot tall in here.
**Jriddle**: Yeah, that's fine.
**Shoff**: Okay.
**Ehillyer**: I think our ceiling's nine foot.
**Ehillyer**: You want it fully up to the ceiling or.
**Ehillyer**: I guess that would probably look the best and the best available.
**Shoff**: Okay.
**Ehillyer**: You got the notes on the ethos patch it vestibule.
**Ehillyer**: Got all that.
**Ehillyer**: Picked up everything on this sheet.
**Ehillyer**: And we just.
**Ehillyer**: We sent these for info.
**Ehillyer**: They were all the drawings you made up.
**Ehillyer**: We got the conveyor receptacles.
**Jriddle**: Yep.
**Ehillyer**: Got all these in here now.
**Ehillyer**: Two, three, four of them.
**Ehillyer**: He's showing four over here.
**Ehillyer**: Two, three, four at 108 power and data power down at 108 others down here.
**Ehillyer**: All right, got that.
**Ehillyer**: And then these are our boxes here.
**Ehillyer**: Coming out.
**Ehillyer**: The wall showed 8 inch, but we put in 10 inch.
**Ehillyer**: I guess as long as it's out there, it's gonna be out of the underneath it.
**Ehillyer**: Yeah, we got this is the cash wrap.
**Ehillyer**: 2 inch between conduits.
**Jriddle**: We three conduits.
**Jriddle**: 2, 2 inch, one 1 inch.
**Jriddle**: The 1 inch will be for the microphone cable.
**Jriddle**: But that'll still be in line with the 2 inch.
**Ehillyer**: See?
**Jriddle**: But I think it's on.
**Jriddle**: I think it's in the detail.
**Ehillyer**: So he just had 22 inch.
**Ehillyer**: We need to add a 1 inch.
**Jriddle**: Yeah, yeah.
**Ehillyer**: What was that for, Andrew?
**Jriddle**: That's just for the microphone cables.
**Jriddle**: We used to have interference with them when they were in the data one.
**Jriddle**: So we separated them.
**Shoff**: Okay.
**Ehillyer**: That's just stubbed up above ceiling like in this wall over here.
**Shoff**: Yeah.
**Ehillyer**: All right, so we got that.
**Ehillyer**: And then these dimensions will lay that out.
**Ehillyer**: And then this base.
**Ehillyer**: Did we ever.
**Shoff**: See.
**Ehillyer**: It was a toe kick four and a half inches and then that three inch trough.
**Ehillyer**: Well, this is good.
**Ehillyer**: We had that note on there before and they didn't pick it up.
**Ehillyer**: It looks like.
**Jriddle**: Yeah, that's why we do this.
**Ehillyer**: That's right.
**Ehillyer**: Can't trust anyone anymore.
**Ehillyer**: To all the design team, I'm just Kidding.
**Ehillyer**: I'm kidding.
**Ehillyer**: If you're on here.
**Shoff**: Okay.
**Ehillyer**: And then that swap we've got done.
**Ehillyer**: Sanitary riser change that putting the sync over here.
**Ehillyer**: We got all that changed.
**Shoff**: Okay.
**Ehillyer**: And then that was it.
**Ehillyer**: Is there anything you're concerned, Andrew, with that you want to look at the new plans?
**Jriddle**: No, I think it looks all pretty good.
**Shoff**: Okay.
**Ehillyer**: Well, today's the day.
**Ehillyer**: We should hear back from the city if they finish on the lower end of their design review.
**Jriddle**: Yeah.
**Ehillyer**: This meeting today at 2.
**Jriddle**: Yeah.
**Ehillyer**: So the.
**Ehillyer**: Is Sandy Pizzo.
**Ehillyer**: Does she work for you or she.
**Jriddle**: No, that's.
**Jriddle**: So it's a meeting with.
**Jriddle**: I guess it'll be our real estate person and then the landlord.
**Shoff**: Okay.
**Jriddle**: I think they're just gonna make sure they know exactly what we're asking.
**Ehillyer**: Okay.
**Ehillyer**: Should I.
**Ehillyer**: Or do you think you need to be on.
**Jriddle**: Yep.
**Ehillyer**: Okay.
**Ehillyer**: I'll forward this to Brian over there and see if he can join.
**Shoff**: Okay.
**Shoff**: Okay.
**Ehillyer**: Write myself a note here.
**Ehillyer**: And you know, we sent them the revisions and told them like we don't have the updated easement yet, but we addressed all their other comments on here.
**Ehillyer**: And just to show you the civil.
**Ehillyer**: So we put.
**Ehillyer**: And the electrical too.
**Ehillyer**: So they picked up right here to panel C.
**Ehillyer**: So they picked up this route so we can.
**Ehillyer**: We don't have to take up any more pavement.
**Ehillyer**: I'll just run it along the back side of that wall to this circuit for the sump pump.
**Shoff**: Perfect.
**Ehillyer**: And then civil is it on this sheet.
**Ehillyer**: So they got the electrical shown coming out.
**Ehillyer**: And then we'll put the sump pump in the vault.
**Ehillyer**: And then we'll just discharge it through the face of the curb here so we can bury it pretty shallow.
**Ehillyer**: And then the plumbing here.
**Ehillyer**: Maybe that was that one extra sheet they updated there.
**Ehillyer**: Here, it's on here to the watering sump pump.
**Ehillyer**: So they specked out the pump we'll put in there.
**Ehillyer**: They got that added.
**Ehillyer**: So that resolved.
**Ehillyer**: Should resolve their comments.
**Ehillyer**: And then we're going to just have our masonry contractor and we'll pour a little foundation and just build this out of CMU so we can extend on to their existing vault and then.
**Ehillyer**: And get the space we need.
**Ehillyer**: And then we'll have our current contractor.
**Ehillyer**: Since we didn't have any utilities work, we're going to have to hire, you know, get another utility contractor to actually do the work to move that existing backflow preventer around.
**Ehillyer**: So Nick's working on getting that.
**Ehillyer**: And then we'll just.
**Ehillyer**: It's a.
**Ehillyer**: Can't think of the name of the product right now, but they sell a.
**Ehillyer**: It's like a cementitious product.
**Ehillyer**: You can just trowel onto the surface as a waterproofing that.
**Ehillyer**: We'll have that all handled.
**Jriddle**: Sounds good.
**Shoff**: Yep.
**Ehillyer**: So think civil wise.
**Ehillyer**: That's it.
**Ehillyer**: You know, the canopy move.
**Ehillyer**: Biggest thing they had to do.
**Ehillyer**: And we adjusted these stairs out the back.
**Ehillyer**: They were actually.
**Ehillyer**: It's like a 41 inch.
**Ehillyer**: We drilled a hole through the wall and so those stairs got a little bit bigger.
**Ehillyer**: You know, just.
**Ehillyer**: We're trying to do it based off the elevations and looked like it was the last, but it.
**Ehillyer**: We thought it was like 28 inches, but they'll just stick out a little more than before.
**Jriddle**: Okay.
**Ehillyer**: Other than that.
**Ehillyer**: And then.
**Ehillyer**: Yeah.
**Ehillyer**: We'd already moved that electrical room.
**Ehillyer**: I think that's gives you a nice wide turn.
**Ehillyer**: People pull a semi through there now.
**Jriddle**: Yeah, they'll probably try.
**Shoff**: Yep.
**Ehillyer**: Well, all right.
**Ehillyer**: Is there anything else?
**Jriddle**: Nope.
**Jriddle**: I think it looks good.
**Ehillyer**: Kate, you've been on here.
**Ehillyer**: I don't know if there's anything you want to add.
**Jriddle**: Nope, I don't think so.
**Shoff**: Okay.
**Ehillyer**: Looks like Jared might have dropped off, but I think we're good.
**Ehillyer**: Have you met Jack yet, Andrew?
**Jriddle**: I don't think I've met Jack in person yet.
**Jriddle**: Did I?
**Jriddle**: If I did, I don't remember.
**Mcordray**: No, not yet.
**Mcordray**: I.
**Mcordray**: I did.
**Mcordray**: I did see you.
**Mcordray**: I did see you walking with a couple people from Goodwill over at Goodwill.
**Mcordray**: Bart, when I was helping.
**Ehillyer**: I get a chance to talk to you.
**Jriddle**: Ah.
**Ehillyer**: Yeah.
**Jriddle**: Well, I'm sure I'll meet you in person eventually.
**Mcordray**: Amen.
**Ehillyer**: It's a little bit of.
**Ehillyer**: Jack's got to go out of town for a week or so and Alex will come over in case we get the permit.
**Ehillyer**: You know, if that happens, then he'll.
**Ehillyer**: You know, because Bart's about to wrap up and then Jack will be back a couple week or two.
**Ehillyer**: Be back on site and get this thing going.
**Shoff**: Sure.
**Jriddle**: Sounds good.
**Shoff**: After.
**Ehillyer**: After this.
**Shoff**: So.
**Shoff**: Yeah.
**Ehillyer**: Are you headed there today?
**Jriddle**: Yep.
**Ehillyer**: All right, cool.
**Jriddle**: Bring the dishwasher too.
**Ehillyer**: Oh, sweet.
**Ehillyer**: How's that fit?
**Ehillyer**: How did that fit in your vehicle?
**Jriddle**: It's right there.
**Ehillyer**: Is that.
**Ehillyer**: You put that in your Tesla.
**Ehillyer**: That.
**Ehillyer**: It reminds me when I was young, I first moved to Florida.
**Ehillyer**: I had this old.
**Ehillyer**: I mean, it was rough Pontiac Sunbird convertible.
**Ehillyer**: And I was working for this guy we were re roofing and so I would put the top down and then lay the plywood over the top of the back of my car to haul it around.
**Jriddle**: It was.
**Jriddle**: That's funny.
**Ehillyer**: It's the first cyber truck.
**Jriddle**: There you go.
**Ehillyer**: So a good deal.
**Ehillyer**: Make sure those guys take it out super careful for you.
**Jriddle**: Yeah, I'll charge you for all the scratches.
**Ehillyer**: Yeah, you should send the bill to Alex, please.
**Jriddle**: There you go.
**Ehillyer**: Just tell them.
**Ehillyer**: Listen, I.
**Ehillyer**: Jesse said he asked you to come pick this up.
**Ehillyer**: I am pissed.
**Ehillyer**: He's refused.
**Ehillyer**: All right, well, good deal, Andrew.
**Ehillyer**: Let us know if you need anything else.
**Ehillyer**: We got.
**Ehillyer**: We finally got to the bottom of the remediation.
**Ehillyer**: Not to change subjects, but for.
**Ehillyer**: For foundations.
**Ehillyer**: And so it looks like, you know, the whole asbestos drywall thing was only like a couple old walls that were taken out anyways.
**Ehillyer**: So they'll take those out, but it shouldn't affect us, I don't think, for cutting the other.
**Ehillyer**: And then the only place the lead paint was was in a wall that's coming out that wanted the ground floor near the entry double.
**Ehillyer**: So we can just have them strip the paint off the.
**Ehillyer**: The trim looks like where it was mostly.
**Ehillyer**: And then a couple doors had it on it.
**Ehillyer**: And then the railings.
**Ehillyer**: So we can have them get rid of all that.
**Ehillyer**: They'll have to take up the floor in the vestibules and the stairs because that mastic that's under the other stuff is also under that.
**Ehillyer**: Okay, so if we do that, do you.
**Ehillyer**: What kind of floor would you want put back in there?
**Jriddle**: Is that on.
**Jriddle**: Is it just the.
**Jriddle**: The bottom floor?
**Ehillyer**: Well, if.
**Ehillyer**: If you want to get rid of asbestos in the space, we would have to take that floor up because it was put down, it looks like, with asbestos mastic.
**Jriddle**: No, I think as far as the other ones.
**Jriddle**: The second.
**Shoff**: First.
**Jriddle**: Second story, whatever you want to call those top two stories, I think we just cover it with.
**Jriddle**: With the flooring.
**Ehillyer**: Okay, so if we want to cover that, then we could also encapsulate that trim with the correct paint.
**Ehillyer**: That can encapsulate lead.
**Jriddle**: Yeah, I think that'd be fine.
**Ehillyer**: You want to do that?
**Ehillyer**: Okay.
**Shoff**: Yeah.
**Ehillyer**: Okay.
**Ehillyer**: I'll let Glenn know.
**Ehillyer**: Okay.
**Ehillyer**: And then they found, like, that mold thing on it.
**Ehillyer**: I think it was just some drywall in certain areas looked like it was maybe bad.
**Ehillyer**: So they may take some of that out, get rid of that problem.
**Ehillyer**: So.
**Ehillyer**: All right, well, we'll get that updated then.
**Ehillyer**: We should be getting all those numbers in here.
**Ehillyer**: I would say early next week, and then we'll.
**Jriddle**: Sounds good.
**Jriddle**: So the asbestos wasn't actually in all the walls.
**Jriddle**: It was just.
**Ehillyer**: It doesn't appear so.
**Shoff**: Yeah.
**Ehillyer**: And when they said the minus 1% means it's.
**Ehillyer**: It's kind of crazy where it's not considered asbestos, but OSHA still makes you do all these things, right, if it's anything under zero.
**Ehillyer**: So, you know, that's kind of tricky, but.
**Shoff**: Okay.
**Ehillyer**: We'll get.
**Ehillyer**: Get the abatement guys to get us around that.
**Ehillyer**: All right?
**Jriddle**: Sounds good.
**Ehillyer**: All right, thanks.
**Ehillyer**: We'll see you.
**Ehillyer**: See you.
