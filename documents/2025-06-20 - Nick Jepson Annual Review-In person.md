**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Howdy.
**Bclymer**: Hey, what's up?
**Jdawson**: Can't hear you.
**Bclymer**: Can you hear us?
**Bclymer**: Brandon?
**Bclymer**: Can you hear us?
**Bclymer**: I got the volume turned up.
**Bclymer**: Are you able to hear us, Brandon?
**Bclymer**: Oh, let me.
**Bclymer**: Oh, it's the speaker.
**Jdawson**: I got you.
**Bclymer**: I got it.
**Jdawson**: Yep, you're good.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Jdawson**: Well, Nick, nice knowing you.
**Jdawson**: Good luck in your endeavors.
**Jdawson**: Joke.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: So Nick got your questionnaire here.
**Bclymer**: See?
**Bclymer**: So feel like being compensated appropriately?
**Bclymer**: You said yes, so.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Sure you're happy with it?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: The Bloomington permit, some of that's just the cities the way they are, but biggest thing now is we got to get that stupid curb cut permit somehow.
**Bclymer**: Gotta get that.
**Bclymer**: But yeah, I think you've done a good job.
**Bclymer**: You know, in my mind you've got a lot of.
**Bclymer**: Got a lot of work you try to manage.
**Bclymer**: So I think you're.
**Bclymer**: I can't really think of anything that I have a problem with anyways.
**Bclymer**: Brandon.
**Jdawson**: No, I think that like I said, you seem to be doing, doing well.
**Jdawson**: You know, you do what you're asked to do.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I think the biggest thing, you know, when I read through this is, you know, like, what do you want to do?
**Jdawson**: Right?
**Jdawson**: Like, you know, I think you said you want to be a, you know, a senior project manager, you know.
**Bclymer**: No, he said he wanted to keep on being pm.
**Jdawson**: Gotcha.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, but just see larger projects, I think that's great.
**Jdawson**: The biggest thing I would say, you know, to grow, you know, in that is, you know, work on, work on skills outside of just processing paperwork, right?
**Jdawson**: So like talk about like growing as an individual, you know, that's just going to help you in your career immensely and your life, right?
**Jdawson**: So if you think about like, where are your weak points, you know, like, and then how do you exercise that muscle to get better at whatever those are.
**Bclymer**: You know, your temper and you're going off on subs all the time and you gotta work on that, Nick.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, but I mean that's all part of becoming more well rounded, right?
**Jdawson**: So if you think of your skills and attributes as a wheel, right, and you're really good as others, but then maybe you've got one that not as good, then that wheel is going to bump, bump, bump every time.
**Jdawson**: And so just thinking about like, okay, like where can I improve, right?
**Jdawson**: Like, what do you think some of your weak points are?
**Bclymer**: Maybe get better at communicating with clients, forming relationships, I guess.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so, so one, one thing to think about too, right?
**Jdawson**: So like when you say like get better, right?
**Jdawson**: That's a hard Thing to measure because, like, get better, okay?
**Jdawson**: That's like saying, get more money.
**Jdawson**: All right, here's a dollar.
**Jdawson**: You know, got more money, right?
**Jdawson**: And so what does that look like?
**Jdawson**: If you ask yourself a better question, okay, like, how can I become more personable?
**Jdawson**: Or how can I build more rapport with clients Instantly, like, start to think about those things and ask those questions, and that's going to help you to do that, you know, because at the end of the day, it's relationships, right?
**Jdawson**: Like, to really get great.
**Jdawson**: Like, you know, you're pretty good at the building side of stuff, you know, and if you can get on the other side of stuff, it's really going to take you farther.
**Jdawson**: Especially, you know, I'd say one way to.
**Jdawson**: To really work on that, you know, is like, not.
**Jdawson**: Not just thinking with the clients, but in general creating relationships, like, with other people, right?
**Jdawson**: So think about, like, mentoring Keva or Candon or any of those guys that you work with, like, Jack, all those guys, like, take it upon yourself, you know, to teach and learn and say, hey, you know, you're really doing this great.
**Jdawson**: Like, you know, like, starting to get personable instead of so transactional.
**Bclymer**: I got it.
**Bclymer**: I got a whole list of jokes you can learn.
**Bclymer**: Nick, that breaks the ice already.
**Jdawson**: Don't do any of those.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So, I mean, that's like, sometimes you think you just call clients when it's only, like, related to something, but it's good to just call.
**Bclymer**: Like, call Andrew Molder.
**Bclymer**: He likes you.
**Bclymer**: So you just call him.
**Bclymer**: Like, hey, is there anything going on that we're not taking care of or something we can help out with or see what he's doing, Things like that, making those calls talked about above and beyond your position.
**Bclymer**: Keep your clients happy.
**Bclymer**: Try to minimize, subcontract, change orders.
**Bclymer**: I appreciate that.
**Bclymer**: I've heard you and seen you do that for us on the Goodwill.
**Bclymer**: You don't just take their numbers and you negotiate them down and things like that.
**Bclymer**: So that's good.
**Jdawson**: So you know one thing, you know, so you know, what have you done above and beyond your position?
**Jdawson**: Like, all those things that you.
**Jdawson**: You wrote, that's.
**Jdawson**: That is your position, right?
**Jdawson**: That's.
**Jdawson**: That is what you're there to do, and you do a good job at it, right?
**Jdawson**: So when you think about, like, what can you do above and beyond?
**Jdawson**: Like, so think about in a broader scheme, right?
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: As far as, you know, Alito, like, where we're growing, what we're doing, what we're lacking, right?
**Jdawson**: So if you start to think about, like, what are we missing?
**Jdawson**: What are we needing?
**Jdawson**: Right?
**Jdawson**: So how can you innovate and help make us better and in turn make everybody better?
**Jdawson**: So maybe that's stuff like, you know, a different checklist or SOP or like anything like that that we're missing.
**Jdawson**: Like, that's the kind of stuff that's immensely valuable.
**Jdawson**: Prime example.
**Jdawson**: This morning, Andrew Cannon was like, hey, Brandon, like, you know, we take drone videos every week.
**Jdawson**: You know, know, what do you think about us putting a link to the video from that week on the weekly report that clients can, can watch?
**Jdawson**: I was like, that's a great idea.
**Jdawson**: Thank you.
**Jdawson**: Like, yeah, get with Maria.
**Jdawson**: Get something put together.
**Jdawson**: Like, that's a great thing.
**Jdawson**: You know, so things like that, those ideas, that's how we, we grow and get better and innovate.
**Bclymer**: Hey, I, I understand.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And I mean, the, the, the whole point, like what I'm trying to get across to you is it's okay for you to try new things and like, you know, you are, you know, a valuable part of this team and you're, you're developing into a leader.
**Jdawson**: And so, you know, don't be scared to step outside of the norm and say, all right, well, how, what can we do different?
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: How can we differentiate ourselves from other builders?
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Like, what can we really do to meet our clients needs before they ask us?
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Things like that.
**Bclymer**: I don't try to think of stuff.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: It's just anything that.
**Bclymer**: Two things that you think would make your life easier.
**Bclymer**: I mean, we do things a certain way here, kind of, and if there's better ways to do them, by all means figure it out and then teach everyone else how to do it.
**Bclymer**: That way, if we look at it and agree it's a good thing to do.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Absolutely.
**Bclymer**: Okay, well, the job's been all profitable.
**Bclymer**: That's good.
**Bclymer**: We should be doing final.
**Bclymer**: Final psr, really, for those.
**Bclymer**: We can close out most of the old aspire jobs and BART should be done.
**Bclymer**: So you can, you can, we can do a comparison, see how they did.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: That is good.
**Bclymer**: You're very mindful on the budget and money, so appreciate that.
**Bclymer**: Job planner.
**Bclymer**: Now, this was a comment Brandon made.
**Bclymer**: You know, if stuff doesn't work or it's not easy, like they can fix things for you or if it doesn't work, like Procore.
**Bclymer**: So it helps us because, you know, I just, when it becomes a problem, I see it because I'm not using it every day.
**Bclymer**: But if you see things that they can make easier Just send it.
**Bclymer**: You know, you talk to us and say, hey, this will work better this way.
**Bclymer**: And then send it to them and have them fix it for you.
**Bclymer**: Okay?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jdawson**: Don't be shy about, you know, sending in those support tickets with those guys.
**Bclymer**: No, I do all the time.
**Jdawson**: This number six doesn't make sense.
**Bclymer**: It doesn't really.
**Bclymer**: Well, he understands my.
**Bclymer**: Can interpolate it.
**Jdawson**: You misspelled my name.
**Jdawson**: Nick.
**Jdawson**: That's good.
**Jdawson**: Just be careful what he teaches you.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I talk about fish.
**Bclymer**: He's pretty good at that now.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So here's a.
**Jdawson**: So working management.
**Jdawson**: Trustee's overseeing a lot of projects, so it doesn't always have time to answer every question.
**Jdawson**: So one thing I would tell you as you grow, right?
**Jdawson**: So you have to get to a point where you are the one answering and solving the questions.
**Jdawson**: And when you do have a question, right?
**Jdawson**: Like we all do.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: I mean, Jesse asked me stuff.
**Jdawson**: I asked Jesse stuff like that Happens.
**Jdawson**: Follow the 1 3, 1 rule, right?
**Jdawson**: So one problem, three possible solutions.
**Jdawson**: Your recommendation?
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: So if you come to Jesse or myself or anybody with that structure, hey, here's the issue.
**Jdawson**: Here's the three possible options we have.
**Jdawson**: I would suggest we go with number two, or whatever that is.
**Jdawson**: Then that's much easier for him to say, yes, no, maybe, or whatever.
**Jdawson**: But that takes off a lot of the burden instead of just coming and saying, hey, I got a problem.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I haven't heard that before.
**Bclymer**: 131.
**Bclymer**: So that makes sense.
**Jdawson**: And that's the same thing with the people that you're over, Right?
**Jdawson**: Like, so, like, if a superintendent, you know, comes to you with an issue, you know, again, preach it throughout, everybody.
**Jdawson**: Hey, guys, you know, 1, 3, 1.
**Jdawson**: What is your problem?
**Jdawson**: What are the three possible solutions?
**Jdawson**: Which one do you suggest?
**Jdawson**: You know, don't just come to me and add another problem on my list for me to solve for you.
**Jdawson**: Like, that's not.
**Jdawson**: Like, we're all critical thinkers here.
**Bclymer**: And it's going to help, too, Like Jesse, you know, he's not really technically on board till July 14, I think, but, you know, there'll be more people in our company that have the same experience or more than we do.
**Bclymer**: And so we're going to have, you know, more people to bounce ideas around on their questions too, so.
**Bclymer**: Mm.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Where do you want to be in five years?
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: So bigger projects.
**Jdawson**: So one thing, Nick, I.
**Jdawson**: I guess I would ask.
**Jdawson**: How do you.
**Jdawson**: Like, we can't always guarantee that there's a bigger project right there in you know, Clearwater or whatever.
**Jdawson**: Like a lot of times, you know, especially when you talk about a bigger project, it's got to have an on site pm.
**Jdawson**: You know, it's not a ti that you can manage three of them, you know.
**Jdawson**: So, like, in order to do that, are you open to, to relocating to a job.
**Bclymer**: Maybe in Florida, but.
**Bclymer**: Or somewhere along the coast?
**Bclymer**: I would.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Just, I mean, again, I, I'm fine with that.
**Jdawson**: Just keep, again, keep in mind that.
**Jdawson**: And we can't guarantee there's always going to be a big job for you to go to right there.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Jdawson**: And so, you know, if we've got a big job, you know, that's in, you know, some shitty state, like Nebraska.
**Bclymer**: You know, I wouldn't even go there.
**Bclymer**: I don't know if I would go there.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So, yeah.
**Jdawson**: So just obviously be cognizant of that.
**Jdawson**: Like, obviously we want you to, you know, get on bigger jobs and stuff like that.
**Jdawson**: Like, you know, maybe I think Paradise Isle might be a good one, but that's not going to be for, you know, a year.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I understand.
**Bclymer**: But now that you can have a loan launcher, the coastline's everywhere.
**Bclymer**: Nick.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: How can I help you get there?
**Jdawson**: I think getting experience over time will help.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, absolutely.
**Jdawson**: And again, like, you know, we'll do our best to, to meet your requests as far as, you know, bigger job and, you know, next to a coast.
**Jdawson**: I just, you know, know, want you to be cognizant of.
**Jdawson**: Like, I, I can't guarantee that.
**Jdawson**: Go ahead, Jesse.
**Bclymer**: There's some good stuff coming up.
**Bclymer**: Like, you know, I talked to, you know, that warehouse project.
**Bclymer**: I called the guy Marion actually answered the phone, but he's over in Europe and just told him, like, hey, your design is really not very good that you're starting with and we'd like to look at it, get rid of all this water under the building and, you know, make it better.
**Bclymer**: And he's like, oh, that sounds great.
**Bclymer**: You know, just work on it.
**Bclymer**: So I think that is a very promising project.
**Bclymer**: And you know, the.
**Bclymer**: Brian, we're still going back and forth on those houses.
**Bclymer**: So, like, we want to build like a job base here in Tampa, St.
**Bclymer**: Pete, this area, you know, with all the Aspire projects, we just turned that in.
**Bclymer**: It was like 80.
**Bclymer**: A little over 80,000 for that drywall and trust repair.
**Bclymer**: I mean, it's so just the cost of it, we figured three weeks full time at Camden and a week in.
**Bclymer**: Nick.
**Bclymer**: Be buried a quarter of a week in my time and then in the Sub lines, but.
**Bclymer**: So it's just hard to mark up a bunch of money on that.
**Bclymer**: But we got everything covered.
**Bclymer**: We should make seven to ten grand.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, something like that on it.
**Bclymer**: I'll leave ten somewhere around.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I sent it to Ronnie.
**Bclymer**: Just told him I'd call him after.
**Bclymer**: Or Nick sent it to Ronnie rather than.
**Bclymer**: But those are, like, relationships that it's going to be, like, very soon.
**Bclymer**: Like, you're the one that's going to call them and talk to them and work out the deals and, you know, that can be your client.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, absolutely.
**Jdawson**: I mean, there's no guarantee we'll get paid, but.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: Wait.
**Bclymer**: One thing Ronnie told me is, you know, he's like.
**Bclymer**: I said, I don't know how we're talking about it, but he's like, I just want you guys to do it because we trust you and, you know, we like you guys.
**Bclymer**: So it's good.
**Jdawson**: That's huge.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Jdawson**: One of the best comments you can get.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Any other questions, Nick?
**Bclymer**: No, No, I don't have anything.
**Jdawson**: Okay, perfect.
**Jdawson**: Well, I think.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, like I said, you know, it's been six months now.
**Jdawson**: I mean, we're.
**Jdawson**: We're happy with where you're going or, you know, we think you've got a good trajectory of growth, you know.
**Jdawson**: So I say keep doing what you're doing to finish the year strong.
**Jdawson**: You know, you're on track for, I would say, a great, you know, bonus.
**Jdawson**: Jesse, would you agree?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, absolutely.
**Bclymer**: I mean, I would hope you could max out your bonus this year.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, appreciate that.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Perfect.
**Jdawson**: Awesome.
**Jdawson**: Well, thank you so much.
**Jdawson**: Appreciate it.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Thanks.
**Bclymer**: Hey, Brandon.
**Jdawson**: Yeah?
**Bclymer**: Did Maria check with Camden?
**Bclymer**: Like, I know he's leaving Dallas today, but about what?
**Bclymer**: Well, his reviews in 30 minutes.
**Jdawson**: Oh, I don't know.
**Jdawson**: I have to ask her.
**Bclymer**: I need to ask her why she's screwing around with my lunchtime.
**Jdawson**: I know, right?
**Bclymer**: What the.
**Jdawson**: Right, that's what I was thinking.
**Bclymer**: I'm gonna have to have her talk to her about that.
**Bclymer**: I don't know if that was because of your schedule or what.
**Jdawson**: No, it's not.
**Jdawson**: I was like, what the.
**Jdawson**: Like, why am I busy at noon, but not one.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so I'll check with Candid.
**Bclymer**: I'll let you know.
**Jdawson**: Just so you know, we got.
**Jdawson**: I just got a call.
**Jdawson**: We got the Harrisburg job.
**Bclymer**: You said that was two point something.
**Bclymer**: I thought it was only like $200,000.
**Bclymer**: Sprinkler.
**Jdawson**: No, 2.4.
**Bclymer**: And when does that start?
**Jdawson**: Mid October.
**Bclymer**: Mid October.
**Bclymer**: That's.
**Jdawson**: Pennsylvania.
**Bclymer**: In Pennsylvania.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Well, if that's the case, do we want to talk to this Alec guy?
**Bclymer**: Maybe he's the.
**Bclymer**: He's the warehouse guy.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, maybe.
**Jdawson**: I mean, you know, it's definitely something I think we could bring in.
**Jdawson**: I mean, I've got, you know, I've got six weeks of PM, 12 weeks of super.
**Jdawson**: You know, I got 12 weeks to travel, 12 weeks of truck at 500.
**Jdawson**: I mean, our GCS on it are 102,000.
**Jdawson**: And then we've got, you know, another hundred extra for design because I got a design only 30 grand.
**Jdawson**: I.
**Jdawson**: I told him it was 145.
**Jdawson**: And then we've got, you know, 221.
**Jdawson**: So we'll make.
**Jdawson**: Right now we're at 323, 321, you know, @ just, you know, what we should make profit wise.
**Jdawson**: And then as far as the.
**Jdawson**: We should have another half a million or so on the sprinkler number.
**Bclymer**: So I was thinking, you know, with him, you know, he said he's from Indianapolis, so he could almost be a.
**Bclymer**: Run some stuff up there and you know, for.
**Bclymer**: And it all depends like what cuts loose the next couple weeks because of, you know, if the crate thing or cart.
**Bclymer**: If cart goes, Goodyear goes.
**Bclymer**: Then at that point do we need.
**Bclymer**: If we're going to let AJ try to more manage people than some of smaller stuff, or do we want to just plug him into the warehouse type projects?
**Jdawson**: I don't know.
**Jdawson**: I think it.
**Jdawson**: I mean, because you got to think.
**Jdawson**: I mean this.
**Jdawson**: This job won't start until October anyway.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, so I didn't.
**Bclymer**: I keep not sharing this with you.
**Bclymer**: Let me.
**Bclymer**: I'll just save this and the.
**Bclymer**: And I already have it saved.
**Bclymer**: So if you go to the executive folder and Manpower.
**Jdawson**: All right, I gotta call my mom.
**Jdawson**: She.
**Jdawson**: Call me real quick.
**Bclymer**: How's your dad?
**Bclymer**: Is he all right or.
**Bclymer**: What's happening with that cancer?
**Jdawson**: Don't know.
**Jdawson**: I haven't.
**Jdawson**: I haven't talked to my dad in years, so I don't.
**Jdawson**: I don't even know.
**Jdawson**: I don't number or anything really.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: All right, well.
**Bclymer**: All right, well, I'll let you know about Canon.
**Bclymer**: Otherwise I'll see you here in a few minutes.
