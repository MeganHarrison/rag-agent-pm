## Transcript
**Rthompson**: It.
**Zach**: Sa.
**Zach**: All right, we'll go ahead and get started since Kagan's on and we just got done meeting with Le Master out here on site.
**Zach**: So just running through the agenda really quick.
**Zach**: United is actually mobilizing in right now as we speak.
**Zach**: They're going to fix the building pad, roll everything, and then build us our stone path like we've talked about.
**Zach**: So, Kagan, that will also be.
**Zach**: You'll be able to use that when you guys start foundations.
**Zach**: Have we have any update, Glenn, on the water tap?
**Rthompson**: No.
**Zach**: No update.
**Zach**: Okay, so like I said, they're also AG peers.
**Zach**: Start next week.
**Zach**: And we'll also be cutting the parking lot degrade this week after they get done fixing the pad and stone and putting that road in.
**Zach**: And then we'll move the.
**Zach**: Then we'll move the job site trailer after that.
**Zach**: Let's see, Dean will begin underground electrical and everything after the parking lot's cut to grade.
**Zach**: So we're looking for Dean possibly mid next week.
**Zach**: Foundations are now starting on the 20 or 9 June.
**Zach**: You're still good with that, Kagan?
**Ikaase**: Yeah, I'm still good with that.
**Zach**: And when's rebar supposed to hit?
**Ikaase**: I have them fabbing now.
**Ikaase**: Starting.
**Ikaase**: Still waiting for the final field use drawings for that revised grade beam that we had around the perimeter.
**Ikaase**: I know it's not really a great beam, but they're finalizing that up.
**Ikaase**: I need to hit them up today, see when those drawings will be here.
**Ikaase**: But they.
**Ikaase**: They already started in fab, so I'll see if they can't be delivering Bar on Tuesday.
**Ikaase**: Just so our guys have a day to mobilize in on the 9th.
**Ikaase**: Still got to figure that out with Tim.
**Ikaase**: Not figured out, but just the whole sequencing of it all.
**Ikaase**: But they're.
**Ikaase**: They're moving with it.
**Zach**: Okay.
**Zach**: And Bar, you're saying he's going to hit the 10th?
**Ikaase**: That's what I have right now.
**Ikaase**: It's them hitting the 10th.
**Ikaase**: I don't know if we're going to be mobilizing Friday before the 9th or if we're actually moving in on the 9th.
**Ikaase**: That's what I need clarification from my field guys.
**Ikaase**: Okay.
**Zach**: You don't have any outstanding submittals, do you?
**Zach**: Not.
**Ikaase**: Not right now.
**Ikaase**: I know I did get an email from Andrew last week.
**Ikaase**: I sent followed back up.
**Ikaase**: Just waiting for that clarification.
**Ikaase**: You guys said sealer.
**Ikaase**: Just want to make sure that we're talking about the dissipating cure.
**Ikaase**: Yep.
**Ikaase**: Or because I know your interior slabs are sealed.
**Ikaase**: I don't believe I from.
**Ikaase**: I was under the impression that you guys are having like gray rock come in or somebody of the sort doing the actual final seal on your slab.
**Zach**: They'll come in and they'll densify.
**Zach**: Yes.
**Ikaase**: Okay.
**Ikaase**: Yeah.
**Ikaase**: So the only thing I need is just to make sure that all our dissipating cure is compatible with what they're going to come in and use this with their densifier.
**Ikaase**: That's all I need from them.
**Ikaase**: Other than that I have a cure and seal for the exterior that I can submit to you guys.
**Ikaase**: And that's the acrylic base that you and I had talked about.
**Zach**: For the exterior?
**Zach**: Yes.
**Ikaase**: Yeah.
**Ikaase**: For the.
**Ikaase**: For the exterior.
**Ikaase**: Covered patio on the grade and up on the metal deck.
**Rthompson**: Perfect.
**Ikaase**: But I do have that I can send you guys once I get back to the office this morning.
**Zach**: Okay, that's perfect.
**Zach**: Lee Masters.
**Zach**: Actually, they're dropping off your anchor bolts right now.
**Zach**: We're getting those unloaded for you.
**Zach**: I'll have those up here by the job site trailer.
**Zach**: So you'll just have to make your templates and you'll be good to go there.
**Zach**: They literally just arrived this morning.
**Zach**: Sequence of the building, like we've talked about.
**Zach**: We're going to start on the south of the collective and progress north.
**Zach**: And then we'll go from where the volleyball and the collective meet and we'll go from west to east.
**Zach**: And that's the same sequence that we're going to do the steel and also.
**Zach**: That work for you?
**Ikaase**: That works, yeah.
**Ikaase**: That's.
**Ikaase**: That's what we originally talked about.
**Ikaase**: And just want to make sure that that's.
**Ikaase**: That we're all still following that same path.
**Ikaase**: So that works for us.
**Zach**: And then just for inspections, you can come in and have either myself or Andrew call them in.
**Zach**: We can set those up for you.
**Zach**: Just give us a good heads up, you know, hopefully not 10 minutes before you want inspection.
**Zach**: Just try to catch us the day before.
**Zach**: So are you thinking that first week you're going to want an inspection every day once you start digging.
**Ikaase**: So.
**Ikaase**: Yeah.
**Ikaase**: So if we mobilize out Monday and we start digging, we'll want that first inspection Tuesday, and more than likely we'll.
**Ikaase**: We'll want one every day just to keep.
**Ikaase**: Keep in front of our.
**Zach**: You said every day you're going to want inspection.
**Ikaase**: Yeah, yeah, I want to get out there, get our stuff there Friday, start digging first thing Monday, and then we'll probably have an inspection even starting Monday.
**Ikaase**: But I'll.
**Ikaase**: Claire, I'll get with Tim and our superintendent Vicente, and see if that.
**Ikaase**: If that's feasible for us.
**Ikaase**: More than likely, we'll start the inspections on Tuesday.
**Zach**: But I'll.
**Ikaase**: I'll.
**Ikaase**: I'll get that confirmation ahead of time here if we want one Monday afternoon or not.
**Zach**: Okay.
**Zach**: And then you'll also follow up with them and see what time of the day they want their inspection for.
**Zach**: I'm going to guess probably one o' clock or two o' clock, the latest.
**Ikaase**: Right?
**Ikaase**: Yeah.
**Zach**: Okay.
**Zach**: So we do have steel package showing up on 69.
**Zach**: It's going to be staged east of the building pad.
**Zach**: It will take up a good amount of area, so just be aware of that.
**Zach**: Also, with your staging for you, I'm assuming you're gonna probably want the rebar.
**Ikaase**: Up on the pad more than likely.
**Zach**: Okay, that'll work.
**Zach**: Because like I said, we're gonna build you a stone road in there.
**Zach**: So that'll be easy enough.
**Zach**: You guys can drive it right up there and you guys can stage it right on the building pad.
**Ikaase**: Yeah, that'll work.
**Zach**: Okay.
**Zach**: You need anything else out of us or are you good on our end?
**Ikaase**: I think I'm good right now.
**Rthompson**: I just.
**Zach**: Got anything for him?
**Rthompson**: Yeah, I just got updated structural drawings here a few minutes ago with that.
**Zach**: Perfect.
**Rthompson**: With that little bathroom area.
**Rthompson**: So I'm gonna send you over that.
**Zach**: You're gonna send those out?
**Rthompson**: Yeah, I'll email it to you.
**Rthompson**: Do you need a.
**Rthompson**: Do you need.
**Rthompson**: Do you use CAD files, Kagan?
**Ikaase**: Yes.
**Ikaase**: Yeah, we do use CAD files.
**Ikaase**: So if she has the updated CAD file sent over to you already.
**Rthompson**: No, I was just that over to.
**Ikaase**: Me, that'd be fantastic.
**Rthompson**: She just sent the PDF.
**Ikaase**: Okay.
**Ikaase**: Yeah.
**Ikaase**: If you can request that CAD file, an updated CAD file from her, that would.
**Ikaase**: That'd be great.
**Rthompson**: Will do.
**Zach**: Are you going to update job planner, Glenn?
**Rthompson**: What?
**Rthompson**: The drawings?
**Zach**: Yes.
**Rthompson**: Yeah, I'm gonna throw.
**Rthompson**: I'll throw them in there.
**Rthompson**: Or Andrew can.
**Rthompson**: Andrew, you want to throw those in there?
**Rthompson**: Upload.
**Rthompson**: Upload those steel drawings.
**Rthompson**: Structural steel drawing or the foundation drawing?
**Rthompson**: Sorry, just the.
**Rthompson**: It's 11 pages.
**Zach**: Okay.
**Zach**: So besides that, I think that's all I've got for this week.
**Zach**: Any.
**Zach**: Glenn, you got anything else?
**Rthompson**: No, we just have Kagan on here, so.
**Rthompson**: No, I'm good.
**Rthompson**: I'll send you that here in a minute.
**Rthompson**: Kagan.
**Zach**: Appreciate it.
**Zach**: Yep.
**Ikaase**: I don't have anything for you guys, so if you need anything, just give me a holler.
**Zach**: I say, Lee Master.
**Zach**: Like I said, they're on site.
**Zach**: They didn't anything out to see they're.
**Zach**: They're still good to hit the 23rd, so we just need to make sure.
**Ikaase**: Foundations are all done by then.
**Ikaase**: Sounds good.
**Zach**: All right.
**Zach**: Andrew, anything to add?
**Ikaase**: All right.
**Zach**: All right.
**Zach**: See you guys.
**Rthompson**: See you.
**Ikaase**: Thank you.
