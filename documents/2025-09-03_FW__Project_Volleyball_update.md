## Short Summary
The meeting covered key developments regarding an economic impact study initiated by Downs and Saint Germain, which has been cleared for sole source approval and aims to provide visitor insights. Contract red lines submitted by Mike are currently under review by the county attorney, with specifics on revenue sharing awaited. Positive discussions have been held surrounding operational mechanics for revenue sharing, utilizing the Department of Revenue as a model. A target deadline of November 18th was set for the agreement approval at the BCC meeting. Florida state statutes necessitate competitive bidding for the construction of a volleyball facility and parking on county property, which will be designed by a private developer in collaboration with county designers. The city of Sanford is responsible for overseeing parking requirements, and a meeting with city officials will be scheduled. The evaluation of the RFP will prioritize qualifications over cost, and endorsements from national governing bodies will aid in contractor selection. Initial complaints are expected for the popular facilities, with confirmed interest from organizations like USA Volleyball and NCAA for event programming. The economic impact study will be expedited, typically taking 8 weeks for completion, with the next update scheduled for October 1st.

## Transcript

**Rick Durr:**
Hey. 

**Cunha, Gui:**
Hey, can everyone hear me? 

**Steve Bishop:**
Hey, how we doing man? 

**Cunha, Gui:**
Perfect. All's good. All's good. 

**Steve Bishop:**
Everyone else hiding or did not get hair and makeup? What's going on? 

**Cunha, Gui:**
No. 

**Kurt Esser:**
Mute, but listening in. 

**Cunha, Gui:**
So this is going to be more of an update call here. Spoke to Mike. You were see he's flying in from out of the country so he won't. Mike won't be on the call today and Christian is not expected on the call as well. So. So as an update here for the whole team, the economic impact study has cleared sole source. It has already begun. Thank you so much Steve for the info. That info has been relayed to Downs and Saint Germain. They do our visitor study there. The contract red lines have already been submitted by Mike and then reviewed by the county attorney's office. There was a couple of next steps that we're looking at that we require from Mike regarding the rev share and, and the payment amount. So we're awaiting that info from Mike. He's currently reviewing it. The rev share very positive. What we're looking at now is more of the operation of the rev share more so than the actual amount of the rev share. So Mike knows we're looking at Department of Revenue to be the verification model. So he understands the, the receipts component of that. He said no big deal. He's looking at the, the, the rev share, the, the year end amount of the rev share that he projected. He's looking at taking that amount X and then reverse engineering what that would be tied to Department of Revenue. He did describe hege. I'm going to write in Department of Revenue. We do have to submit monthly so we'll write in based on the percentage of that receipt. He said he doesn't foresee that being an issue at all. So we're looking at lump sum there. We are also looking at the, the possible cost of not just a volleyball facility but also parking and looking at what can be some options to fund that. One of the pieces, and this mainly for Brandon that we did get clarification on from the attorney is when it comes to volleyball and or parking per Florida state statute that will have to go out to bid for the standard procurement process on those two. So anything that stays, when we looked at the site plan, anything that stays within the county will have to go through the state statute on procurement on that. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
And so just as far as design and everything goes. So you guys will send a RFP out for design as well and then you'll do design drawings and then do that or how does that work? 

**Cunha, Gui:**
So, Rick, I don't know if you can speak on some of the details on that to actually volleyball. 

**Rick Durr:**
For those, we have continuing services agreements for the design side of things that if we needed to pull from those, we could. So we wouldn't have to put out a separate rfp. It's going to be, from what I understand, it's more for the construction where we got to submit and have folks submit bids for the construction of the facility. So that way we're going through all of the procurement standards that way in order to get a contractor under contract within those ordinances. But the design side of things, I do not believe. And again, I'm going to put an asterisk next to that. We should be able to pull those from already standing contracts that we've already gone through procurement on. We've got probably about a dozen of those things. 

**Steve Bishop:**
So. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Okay, so then we essentially, in the private side, the stuff that is not the public land, so we would go ahead and do our design and everything and then say, all right, here's our design, and then you guys will take that and build off of it. So, you know, as far as, hey, our storm is going down this way, it ends here. You're going to pick up and take it. 

**Rick Durr:**
Exactly, exactly. Yeah. Essentially, we're bound on our county's property to abide by those particular rules and regulations. On top of that, I don't see it as a problem of interfacing between the two. Not a problem. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Gotcha. Yeah. So as far as order of operations, we have to get our design, at least the conceptual or schematic design done so that your designers can then pick up off of it and go from there. 

**Cunha, Gui:**
Yep. 

**Rick Durr:**
And put the whole thing. 

**Cunha, Gui:**
Yeah. Then. 

**Rick Durr:**
Then show the whole thing together. So. And then. And then be able to put the whole thing out to bid in terms of construction. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Well, so they'll show. So just so I understand, the part that you're putting out to bid for construction is the volleyball area and the parking area. The stuff is not going up to bid. Yeah. So in reality, it would be, you know, our, you know, our design, everything, and then it would just be a bid for these other two sides. 

**Cunha, Gui:**
Yep. Correct. Yeah. The county. The county. 

**Rick Durr:**
Yeah. The quote unquote, public part of the facility. Yes. 

**Cunha, Gui:**
Yeah, Gotcha. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Okay, so then, yeah, essentially it would be two permits, everything. 

**Cunha, Gui:**
Yep. And when you touched on permitting, just to give you a heads up, we did a review with our development services director, and he confirmed that parking and all that would be the requirements would be with the City of Sanford. So we do have. Looking to schedule an initial meeting. Right now we have a request with their economic development director with Brady and the development services director, Eileen Henson out at City of Sanford, just to see what the parking requirements would be to assist in that possible estimate of. Of that part of the project, that specific parcel. And from a calendar standpoint, we are still anticipating currently the November 18th BCC meeting to have this agreement on the agenda there. Mike has been very clear that that's his expectation. That message has been relayed throughout the county that November 18th is the deadline that we're working off of. Okay. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
And so that parking meeting, essentially what that is, is you guys will meet with the county to say, hey, this is our parcel that we're putting the parking on. How much are you going to require and make sure that that fits in that county parcel. 

**Cunha, Gui:**
Yes. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Or I should. Yeah, city. You understand what I'm saying? 

**Cunha, Gui:**
So. So there's the computer. It's county owned, but the permitting, that's city. So yes, the public parcel and city. Yeah, public. There you go. The public parcels. Yeah. 

**Rick Durr:**
I mean, honestly, we, we developed the, the sports complex right adjacent to it. We had to do the exact same thing. So it was in the city, but we had to go through their, their development standards to do so. So. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Gotcha. 

**Rick Durr:**
Same steps here. Perfect. 

**Steve Bishop:**
Can we talk about the volleyball portion of this project with respect to the, the build out of the courts? Who, who do you. We. We have a preferred company. They just built courts at Lake Sumter State College. How would we be able to participate in that selection process? You can't just have some guy who builds playgrounds all of a sudden decide to low bid international level, same volleyball complex, and then we have to come in and try and solve all of that. How do we get in front of that? 

**Cunha, Gui:**
Rick, do you want to discuss on the RFP process and the bids? Because I know on our side it's not always the lowest bid that's selected. 

**Rick Durr:**
On and it's actually not on our side as well. So we would put together, we would have to put together a scope of services that made it very clear on number one is not just based on being able to perform the work, but then based on the qualifications as well. So we could put in any kind of requirement that we needed that says you would have had to have built, you know, X number of courts to this number of standards to. And then be able to show that you've done this work before and have the capability to do so so that we're not getting, like you said, I don't want to any of my facilities. I don't want that either. So we want to make sure that we get the folks that have the best on the table and it's not going to be based low bid. We can structure the evaluation so that price is be a part of it, but qualifications and a demonstration and being able to hold to a schedule and meet our specs can be the majority of the, the qualification points that go into the, the evaluation. So we've got a lot of flexibility in that regard to make sure that we get the quality product that we're all looking for and that it's not just based upon whoever comes in lower. 

**Steve Bishop:**
All right. And is there any leverage or room here for there to be a requirement to get an endorsement from the national governing body of the sport with respect to work performed? Because that will, that'll just streamline this whole process because there's only a couple companies we would give an endorsement to. 

**Rick Durr:**
Sure. I don't see why we couldn't include that in the list of requirements. So, so when it, when it comes time to put that piece together, we're going to want all that information from you, including who you've used before specifically. Because what we can do is have our purchasing folks reach out to them on the side and go, hey, when this RFP comes out, all you got to do is go to this link, make sure that you're on the list, we'll send it to you automatically and you can guarantee that they're going to get that information. 

**Steve Bishop:**
Yeah, I don't mind if a couple of the what I would call approved companies bid on it. I don't have an issue with that, but it just makes me nervous. Like the last time we built the international level competition venue, the county turned it over to us. We built it and so I knew it was right because I had a, I had the project manager out there every day and I went out there once a week during the build to make sure that everything was appropriate to be able to host, you know, high level events. So. And I don't, I don't know what my schedule will be and I don't know what the timeline is going to look like if this happens in the spring months heading into June. I'm on the road a lot. The fall, I'll have a little bit more time to be on site and be hands on. And so I'm certainly willing to offer help. And I know Kristen on Kurt's team there, she was on board with Me when we did the Lake county project. So we can offer some help and support. But that helps a lot, Rick. And when we get to that point, I'd be glad to give you whatever information you need so that I just don't want us to get a bunch of bids from people who built a court in their backyard and now all of a sudden they want to make a business out of this. 

**Rick Durr:**
No, no. And agreed, we don't either. And Steve, from that standpoint, we want to make sure that we've got the facility that's going to be able to attract the kind of tournaments that you're exactly what you're talking about. And without that, then we got nothing. So we want to make sure that we, whatever it is we build is going to be built to that spec so that we're bringing in the big ones. I mean, otherwise we're sand in a hole all day long and it's not going to get us. 

**Steve Bishop:**
Yeah, and the amount of concrete in the base because we put so much tension on those poles for high level events that you know, if you don't do it right within a couple of years, your poles look like this. They don't look like this anymore. And you can't fix that without digging it all out and redoing it. 

**Rick Durr:**
Yeah, no thanks. Not interested. Yeah. 

**Cunha, Gui:**
Another piece of quality control for you, Steve, on top of including it in the scope of work where it can be a disqualifier, then if they, they do not have those certain parameters is you're, you're, you're looking to utilize tourist development tax dollars for this project. When you utilize TDT now you have to have events that are returning TDT back to the hotels. So that's the thing. If you put a poor quality of playing surface in whatever sport and you utilize TDT in that project and it's not returning any type of economic impact based on room nights, that becomes a major issues to our hotel, a major issue to our hoteliers that are currently not just paying TDT but are also paying an assessment on the tourism Improvement District. So our phones are ringing off the hook on, hey, we're paying the assessment. There's a board, there's now a TID board and TDC board. So the hoteliers are more vocal now than ever. So at this point, yeah, we making sure the facility is generating these large scale events on a continuous basis and reinvestment to make sure that these events continue to grow and come back. Yeah, that, that's a top priority for us. 

**Steve Bishop:**
Perfect. All very helpful. Didn't mean to belabor that too far, but I just wanted to raise the flag now while it was a discussion item. Thank you. 

**Rick Durr:**
Absolutely. 

**Kurt Esser:**
Hey, this is Kurt. Can you guys hear me okay? 

**Cunha, Gui:**
Yep, all is good, Kurt. 

**Kurt Esser:**
And you know, Steve's been around this and a similar project for my education. Are you guys or will the Danny Trosset's team work with us to secure new inventory, new items, new tournaments and events? Will you look to us to create our own programming? And who's going to maintain the courts? Will that be the park staff? 

**Cunha, Gui:**
Sorry for those questions. 

**Kurt Esser:**
I just want to. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
No, no, no. 

**Cunha, Gui:**
It's the same balance that we have over at Boomba. So there is a very strong partnership between tourism, business development side that Danny's division manager over where marketing and sales is mainly our priority on that function. Operations, day of events, that goes on the parks and rec side. And that's why we're actually housed in the same facility out at Bomba, in the same building out there. So Danny and Chris and Dave are business development. We see this very similarly to what we have at Boomba, where USA Volleyball can look at bringing in multiple events. We do know FHSAA has shown interest. Sports Commission has been very interested. Ncaa, njcaa, naia, all the acronyms are very, very interested as well in this project. So on the business development side, for us, it's creating that calendar, but also understanding the local use of the complex as well. There's a balance that will create. If it's similar to Bombo, which I think rolling out all new complexes, we end up with. The volatility kind of goes away as the years come around. The first year we do have, you know, sometimes there's residents and tournaments, they butt heads and someone complains and all. It was the exact same thing with Boomba. So as the years go by, we. If we're building a complex that's enviable, that many people want to use, you're going to get complaints. What I tell the commissioners when we have that conversation is you show me a complex that doesn't have anyone complaining, then I'll show you an empty complex. So if it's a complex people want to use, be ready, because you're not going to have both. Show me the county that has Kumbaya that everyone comes and says, hey, visitors and residents love the complex alike and all of them work together in the programming schedule. That does not happen. And we know that with time, with the system we have in place, we were able to navigate that, but we will. All parks and rec tourism, sports business development side USA Volleyball. We will be working very closely together on that, that, that sand complex. 

**Kurt Esser:**
Very good. I just, you know, I, I understand being a, you know, tenant holder or you know, somebody that utilized the softball complex both locally, regionally with the njca. It was a good mix and you're right after year one, two or three, once you start to see where your dead spots are, then you can develop local programming around those bigger. 

**Cunha, Gui:**
Yeah, I would not set the expectation that this will be built and everyone is going to be happy and it's, it's going to be to perfection. I've yet, I've yet to see a new complex accomplish that feat. So if there's demand, there's likely going to be someone's feelings hurt that are left out of certain dates that they wanted. That happens all the time. 

**Steve Bishop:**
And then question on that which we can tackle a different day and maybe with Danny without being too far into the weeds here because this really gets into the idea of lead times and event acquisition. So from Kurt's point of view and I talked to Kristen this morning, you know, they need a, they need a ramp up or a lead time to go out and bid on events and they can't bid on events until they have a venue to bid on them with. So every, every season, quote unquote season that we don't have sand on the ground is another cycle that delays bringing in the big ones. 

**Cunha, Gui:**
So I'm glad you touched on it, Steve, and so did Kurt. A couple of missing contacts in this call and I think once we, we get the agreement finalized at this point, that, at that I think Danny and a representative from Go Sports, Elizabeth Calderelli, she's the one that manages all our bids to the NCAA and jca, all the acronyms that those would be the next two that would be added on to this call and conversation. I think, I would think sooner rather than later. Before we get into the business development discussion there, which is predominant, what they're going to focus on. We just want to make sure we finalize these last two remaining points on the agreement. A lot of positivity. Risk manager reviewed the agreement already provided the new insurance requirements. Not a large lift by any means. The meeting to review the red lines, I believe, I mean Rick and Michael, I'm not going to be overly optimistic, but it was better than what I thought. And when I say that, I mean the meeting led to the next meeting. It wasn't dead on arrival. 

**Rick Durr:**
Yeah, absolutely. That's a good way to put it. I Think it. I think it went better. It's smoother than I would have ever expected. And you're right, it led to the next step here, so. Which is why we're still. Why we're still on the call. 

**Steve Bishop:**
I'm glad. I was hoping this wasn't gonna face plant somewhere. 

**Cunha, Gui:**
Yeah. So the economic impact study, it usually takes eight weeks. We're trying to shorten it as much as possible down. St. Germain does a good job. So as soon as we get that data, that'll be reviewed internally. And then on this call we do anticipate there being another estimate or two coming forth from Christian side. Christian said he's putting them together. And there's one final piece from Michael on. From Mike Ewers on the contract on the. The amount that he is comfortable with. So long term lease lengthwise was an issue there. So a lot of points of agreement at that point, but still shooting for November 18th. And see, I believe our next meeting here just to give everyone an update. Leave our next. 

**Steve Bishop:**
What's the time of the November 18th meeting? Sorry, it would likely. 

**Cunha, Gui:**
Rick, do you think this is going on consent or what do you think? 

**Rick Durr:**
Even if it doesn't, it'd be right after consent. So it would be in the morning. It's not. It wouldn't. I don't believe would require a formal public. Public hearing. So that's. Those are the afternoon meetings. So it should be in the morning. 

**Cunha, Gui:**
Yeah, yeah. 

**Steve Bishop:**
So that's a 9 o' clock start. 

**Cunha, Gui:**
Normally 9:30, 9:30 start. 

**Rick Durr:**
Yeah. 

**Steve Bishop:**
All right. Yeah, I'm gonna try and put that on my schedule. I wouldn't mind. Wouldn't mind being there to show support. So. 

**Cunha, Gui:**
Yeah. Cool. Perfect. And we'll keep the updates. Does everyone. Just a question. I know this a quick meeting. Do we want to have another Update on the 17th? Our next meeting scheduled is Sept.17th. I do not foresee the agreement or the study being done then. So I was. I was going to remove that meeting unless someone would like to keep it on the calendar there. 

**Steve Bishop:**
Yeah, I'm fine. If we don't have anything pressing, let's give everyone back some time. 

**Rick Durr:**
Otherwise, Guy, it looks like the following meeting after that would be October 1st, so instead of two weeks, it'd be in four weeks. 

**Cunha, Gui:**
Yeah, so that should be. Yeah, there should be an update on that one for sure. Yeah. Very good. 

**Steve Bishop:**
All right. See if you. Did you guys have any questions on the document I sent over to you this morning? I'd reviewed that with Kurt and his team. Obviously very conservative, but I Wanted to give you something that we could get comfortable with coming out of the gates. 

**Cunha, Gui:**
So it may. And this all depends on county attorney's office because this is an economic development agreement, state statute 125045 that we're utilizing the economic impact may get. The study may get added on as an exhibit. I do not know for sure. So the fact the numbers that you gave there being conservative in the case that this gets added on as an exhibit, it does make it a public record. So at that point it's very good that you were conservative on there because you're. The benchmark there at the current site is a sand distribution like facility. Ish. Yeah. So you're not. You're not benchmarking against any current facility that's generating any economic impact. 

**Steve Bishop:**
Yeah. No, this is fresh start by detail. Yeah. 

**Cunha, Gui:**
It was refreshing. I will tell you that. Steve, every time that we get a new project coming in, it's always like, look, you're going to bring us. It's a brand new event. We're going to bring half a million people from Japan here and they're going to spend all the money. Yeah. Seminole county will be Dubai by the time we end the agree. That's usually what we get. So when you send over to me and you're like, look, hey, this is. I know for a fact these are good numbers. These are numbers I stand by. It's very refreshing to see, to be honest with you. 

**Steve Bishop:**
Very good. Well, thanks to Kurt and Kristen this morning. We. We did a little review on this to make sure we were all comfortable, but I think it feels pretty good. 

**Cunha, Gui:**
Cool. Perfect. All right, sounds like a plan. I'll give everyone September 17th back and then we'll be ready for October 1st. 

**Steve Bishop:**
Appreciate everyone's work on this. Thank you. 

**Rick Durr:**
Thank you everybody. 

**Cunha, Gui:**
Appreciate it. Thank you.
