## Transcript
**Brian.schubert**: Hey, Brian.
**Brian.schubert**: How are you?
**Crusin**: Good.
**Crusin**: How about you?
**Brian.schubert**: Thank you.
**Crusin**: So, I apologize.
**Crusin**: We meant to send that to you yesterday.
**Crusin**: We had that done.
**Crusin**: And the life safety stuff, I just want to go over a couple quick, quick things before we submit to the state.
**Crusin**: That's okay.
**Brian.schubert**: Yes, that's okay.
**Crusin**: Okay.
**Crusin**: On other projects, do you have like a pick unit as part of this or is it just kind of the shelf storage?
**Crusin**: The high, you know, the high density storage stuff?
**Crusin**: Is there like a pick unit that's part of the.
**Crusin**: This part of the project?
**Crusin**: You egress through it.
**Crusin**: Like it has levels and everything.
**Brian.schubert**: That I'm not too sure about.
**Brian.schubert**: I can.
**Crusin**: We can show you an example of another project.
**Crusin**: Hold on one second.
**Crusin**: So this, this QCR screen there.
**Brian.schubert**: This.
**Crusin**: Is our project that we did for you guys in.
**Crusin**: I think this might be in Greenwood and the state, it had one of these pick units.
**Crusin**: The state had us do these sections through it so they could see how you egress through it.
**Crusin**: So I wasn't sure if this had one of those or not.
**Crusin**: It may not.
**Brian.schubert**: Okay.
**Brian.schubert**: I know they do have racking in there.
**Brian.schubert**: I can.
**Crusin**: The rack is the racking spine because you ingress that grade these things.
**Crusin**: There's like people on different levels.
**Brian.schubert**: I see.
**Brian.schubert**: I don't think.
**Brian.schubert**: I think so.
**Crusin**: My name's Candon.
**Crusin**: I don't believe they do have a picmod in this radio building.
**Crusin**: Perfect.
**Crusin**: Okay, perfect.
**Crusin**: I think we're, you know, all we got to do is hold on one second.
**Crusin**: We'll walk in.
**Crusin**: Life safety plan.
**Speaker 2**: Yes, we've dropped in the plan that you all had sent over.
**Speaker 2**: What we weren't sure is that there was any scope on the north.
**Speaker 2**: On the north side that we needed to also incorporate.
**Brian.schubert**: Right now we do not.
**Brian.schubert**: But looking at this, it does look like.
**Brian.schubert**: Because we just received updated drawings and I think there might be a little more information than what you guys have from that center.
**Brian.schubert**: That arrow that comes down in towards the center of the building.
**Brian.schubert**: I think towards a little bit of.
**Brian.schubert**: Right on it.
**Brian.schubert**: There is more information.
**Brian.schubert**: I'm going to share that CAD file with you guys and the PDF of it.
**Crusin**: Yeah, you send that over.
**Crusin**: We'll get that put in and we'll.
**Crusin**: That's not a big deal.
**Crusin**: We get that done.
**Brian.schubert**: Okay.
**Crusin**: And then we can.
**Crusin**: We have the application ready, I believe.
**Speaker 2**: Right.
**Speaker 2**: I'll have to check, but we'll get that over.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, we'll get that over to you for signatures today.
**Crusin**: Is there any.
**Crusin**: Is there any electrical scope or anything?
**Crusin**: We have the drawing.
**Speaker 2**: We don't have Dean drawings yet.
**Crusin**: Okay.
**Crusin**: Once we have the electrical drawings, we'll be ready to submit.
**Brian.schubert**: Okay.
**Brian.schubert**: Yeah.
**Brian.schubert**: Yeah.
**Brian.schubert**: The electrician is working on the electrical drawings now.
**Brian.schubert**: They said they might have it to us by Friday or latest Monday.
**Crusin**: Okay.
**Brian.schubert**: Yeah.
**Crusin**: Are you.
**Crusin**: Are you working with.
**Crusin**: Who are you working with?
**Crusin**: The Dean Bradshaw Spychance Alice.
**Crusin**: Okay.
**Crusin**: I might see if I can get them to get us out a little quicker so we get this submitted.
**Crusin**: But as soon as we have that, we'll package it up, update our index and shoot it over the state.
**Crusin**: The city.
**Speaker 2**: Is that Alex Woodham?
**Brian.schubert**: Yes.
**Speaker 2**: He's good.
**Crusin**: So, yeah, so we're.
**Crusin**: I mean, I think we're good to.
**Speaker 2**: Go on our end.
**Brian.schubert**: Okay.
**Speaker 2**: When we get their drawings, we'll update.
**Speaker 2**: We'll update the index.
**Speaker 2**: Just include all of their.
**Speaker 2**: Their drawings and then of course slip those in.
**Brian.schubert**: Gotcha.
**Brian.schubert**: And how long is the process normally after you guys send in to the city?
**Crusin**: The city is very fast.
**Crusin**: We file expedited with that.
**Crusin**: The state is 15 business days minimum.
**Brian.schubert**: Gotcha.
**Brian.schubert**: All right.
**Crusin**: Hey, unless you want to say it again.
**Crusin**: I would else would have been expedited $5,000 fee with the state, which I think is probably don't need to do unless you're in a real time crunch.
**Brian.schubert**: Five grand you said is for.
**Crusin**: To expedite it with the state.
**Crusin**: Yeah.
**Crusin**: Yeah, I think it's 48 hours.
**Brian.schubert**: Gotcha.
**Brian.schubert**: Okay.
**Brian.schubert**: I don't think.
**Speaker 2**: We might for the.
**Crusin**: That state release without review.
**Crusin**: So maybe those.
**Crusin**: Those were the only questions that I would have with you is how you wanted us to submit it.
**Crusin**: The expedited with the city is.
**Crusin**: Is basically $450.
**Crusin**: So we do that every time.
**Crusin**: And then we don't usually get the state issue requests to expedite it.
**Brian.schubert**: Okay.
**Brian.schubert**: I'm gonna have to ask Jesse about that, what he thinks.
**Crusin**: Okay.
**Crusin**: Yeah, yeah, no problem.
**Crusin**: I mean, you can let us know the day we submit.
**Crusin**: You know what I'm saying?
**Crusin**: So you've got some time until we get the Dean drawings.
**Brian.schubert**: Okay.
**Brian.schubert**: Yeah.
**Brian.schubert**: So I just sent you in the chat here just sent the latest CAD drawings that we have.
**Crusin**: We got them.
**Brian.schubert**: Okay.
**Speaker 2**: Download.
**Crusin**: Can you.
**Speaker 2**: For some reason those are not downloaded.
**Speaker 2**: Can you just email those to me?
**Brian.schubert**: Yes, I can do that on that.
**Speaker 2**: Last one from the last email I sent from Jerome.
**Crusin**: Hit them in the directory.
**Brian.schubert**: Sa.
**Brian.schubert**: Okay, I'm gonna have to find a way to share it because it's too big to attach to the email.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, let me know if you need.
**Speaker 2**: I can send like a Dropbox folder.
**Speaker 2**: I think you might be able to drop it in or something like that if you need.
**Speaker 2**: If you need a spot.
**Brian.schubert**: Okay.
**Brian.schubert**: Yeah, that would actually help if you could do that.
**Brian.schubert**: Okay.
**Crusin**: So if you guys want, what we could do is touch base on Friday, just make sure our part's all good.
**Crusin**: We'll see if we got everything from demons.
**Crusin**: I think we should be good to submit.
**Brian.schubert**: Okay.
**Brian.schubert**: Yeah, that's.
**Brian.schubert**: That's a good idea.
**Brian.schubert**: We can do that.
**Crusin**: Yeah.
