## Transcript
**Aelkarrimy**: Good afternoon, good morning to those where the sun rises.
**Bclymer**: Good afternoon and good night.
**Aelkarrimy**: See here.
**Aelkarrimy**: Is there anybody we're waiting on?
**Aelkarrimy**: Doesn't look like it.
**Aelkarrimy**: We got Yuzuke, Kevin, Joe.
**Aelkarrimy**: I think everybody else, right?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I think, I think we got everybody.
**Aelkarrimy**: All right, great.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay, so quick update.
**Aelkarrimy**: So the city is still not finished reviewing drawings.
**Aelkarrimy**: Our reviewer Scott was on vacation and the other guy was out.
**Aelkarrimy**: Scott was back today.
**Aelkarrimy**: Eileen said that she was going to put it in front of them.
**Aelkarrimy**: So we'll, we'll follow up again, you know, tomorrow and Friday to see what the status is and see if they've got a chance to look at that.
**Aelkarrimy**: And that's it.
**Aelkarrimy**: So the submittals, you know, already collected a bunch of submittals.
**Aelkarrimy**: Ahmed, I think you were going to send a, send a note, you know, after this meeting or something like that on who needs to get what submittals so that we can push those out to you guys.
**Bclymer**: Yep, I'm on it right now, actually, as we speak.
**Bclymer**: So Brian and Aaron.
**Bclymer**: I don't think John's on.
**Bclymer**: So Aaron, what we're planning on doing is just issuing a quick email.
**Bclymer**: This is to just set up the flow for shop drawings.
**Bclymer**: So I just need to understand the contact information like an email and first and last name just so that I can provide it to Brandon and he can set up the shop drawing disbursement flow.
**Bclymer**: So I'll, I'll set up an email.
**Bclymer**: If you guys can just respond with the personnel that are supposed to receive shop drawings and if there's any certain sequence that you guys have for tpg, we're just.
**Bclymer**: It's either myself or Ben who receives it.
**Bclymer**: Whoever uploads it, it's good to go for the next party.
**Bclymer**: So I'll put all of that into the email.
**Jdawson**: Okay, sounds good.
**Jdawson**: And on our side, you can just send it to me and.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I'll review it usually, but I will respond to it via email as well.
**Kevin.ly**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: So.
**Bclymer**: Joe, this is also for you, just so you're aware.
**Bclymer**: Is there, are there any shop drawings that need to go to Exotech?
**Bclymer**: I believe, like the fire suppression system still needs to be reviewed by them.
**Bclymer**: Right?
**Aelkarrimy**: Are you talking about our submittals?
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Aelkarrimy**: No, they, they won't check anything.
**Aelkarrimy**: All, you know, they, they provide.
**Aelkarrimy**: Basically they give us saying, here's the bracket we're providing, here's the holes.
**Aelkarrimy**: And then that's just.
**Aelkarrimy**: We buy our U bolts to match and the pipe and everything.
**Mparsons**: Yeah, we've, we've went over that.
**Mparsons**: And Brian thank you for.
**Mparsons**: He sent over the, the design and we just, I just requested it for our, basically for our documentation.
**Mparsons**: That's all.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: So okay, that's the update on the submittals view process.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yazuke looking at your.
**Aelkarrimy**: I'll share my screen.
**Aelkarrimy**: So this drawing for your.
**Aelkarrimy**: Your questions.
**Aelkarrimy**: So first off, we can run this project however you would like.
**Aelkarrimy**: If you want me to, to do something at a certain time or whatever out of order, we can do that.
**Aelkarrimy**: Keep in mind there's going to be costs associated with us doing stuff in a less efficient way.
**Aelkarrimy**: But if there's something that you want done, a certain reason, whatever it is, then we're happy to, to do that.
**Aelkarrimy**: Just keep in mind that we set these things up to run efficiently and if we have to go do things that are not the most efficient way is going to add cost.
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay.
**Bryan.wagar**: So it will be cost if you try to achieve this schedule, like to bring some of the work ahead.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah, if we've got to accelerate material deliveries or again if we have to do things out of order.
**Aelkarrimy**: You know, some of this stuff, it's, it all depends on, on this right here.
**Aelkarrimy**: Right.
**Aelkarrimy**: Everything builds on this schedule concurrently off of this date.
**Aelkarrimy**: Right.
**Aelkarrimy**: So we haven't gotten a permit yet.
**Aelkarrimy**: We're still, you know, that's all that we were, we were told it was going to be a week, it's now been three and it doesn't look it's going to be this week.
**Aelkarrimy**: So this is already going to push back.
**Aelkarrimy**: But if you want us to get in there and cut the floor and do some of this stuff before we have the permit or maybe before we're ready, we can do that.
**Aelkarrimy**: It's just different things out of order are going to have cost impacts and I can't quantify that just yet based off of this.
**Aelkarrimy**: Now if you tell me, Brandon, no matter what, tell me what it's going to cost to do this, then I'll get that priced up.
**Bryan.wagar**: I'm not asking you to start the work before the permit.
**Bryan.wagar**: So.
**Bclymer**: What he also means is like for example, when you and I were discussing we wanted to move the installation of the HE1 panel and the new panels earlier than line item.
**Bclymer**: I believe it was line item.
**Mparsons**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So what he's saying is that right now this schedule is developed in a way where it's sequential and they have a flow.
**Bclymer**: They have a game plan that's devised.
**Kevin.ly**: That doesn't cause conflicts on site.
**Bclymer**: But if you decide to say I want to move this scope up, there might be conflicts with other dates that might push those dates out.
**Bclymer**: And it would also incur a cost for him to get those subs on sooner rather than later.
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay, for example, which part is cost is not cost effectively, effectively.
**Aelkarrimy**: Which format?
**Bryan.wagar**: Comic.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay, so like this right here.
**Aelkarrimy**: So you want to.
**Aelkarrimy**: You said earlier than item nine, finish scope by 6:26.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: So.
**Aelkarrimy**: So that right there.
**Aelkarrimy**: So we don't have, we don't have these panels and we don't have any these feeders or anything yet.
**Aelkarrimy**: Now we could rush delivery and probably get them.
**Aelkarrimy**: And then we would need to crew up because if you look at the durations here, that's 30 days.
**Aelkarrimy**: So you would want us to get this done by 6:26.
**Aelkarrimy**: We're assuming that we'll get a, if we get a permit next week, then that puts us right up against that.
**Aelkarrimy**: We'd have to crew up to try to get that done to meet that date.
**Aelkarrimy**: You would have to accelerate the schedule to meet that date to do it.
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay, so how about not finishing on June 26th but start in first week of June?
**Aelkarrimy**: Is that possible to start these two items?
**Aelkarrimy**: Specifically the 17.
**Bryan.wagar**: We can start 18 after finishing 17.
**Aelkarrimy**: So, so the new feeders for MP NPD to he one starting on.
**Aelkarrimy**: On six.
**Aelkarrimy**: You said six one.
**Bryan.wagar**: First week.
**Bryan.wagar**: So six.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Week of June 2nd.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yes, June 2nd.
**Aelkarrimy**: It just depends.
**Aelkarrimy**: I mean so if you're looking at your calendar here, right, so we again, we don't have a permit.
**Aelkarrimy**: So you're talking about, you know, let's say we get it end of next week.
**Aelkarrimy**: They haven't even started review yet.
**Aelkarrimy**: But let's say we get the end of next week.
**Aelkarrimy**: You want us on site running that stuff in a week later.
**Aelkarrimy**: Now that means that we've got to pull everybody up and say, hey, drop what you're doing and get out here and do this.
**Aelkarrimy**: Because everybody gets scheduled.
**Aelkarrimy**: That's why we have this two week lag time from when we get our permit to mobilization.
**Aelkarrimy**: So we get a permit.
**Aelkarrimy**: Like, all right guys, let's get on the schedule.
**Aelkarrimy**: Let's mobilize, get started.
**Aelkarrimy**: Instead it's like, hey guys, drop what you're doing.
**Aelkarrimy**: Come over here and do this.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So you cannot like say come.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: You got to say anything to your subs before getting the permit.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah, we, we talk to our subs.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yes, but if I tell them, hey guys, get on the schedule to start two weeks from now, like okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: And then all of a sudden the permit doesn't come, then they, they had us slotted for that.
**Aelkarrimy**: We got guys there and now they're going home.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: If we cannot get the permit.
**Bryan.wagar**: Before.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Starting work right from June, that's worse.
**Aelkarrimy**: Correct.
**Aelkarrimy**: Correct.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah, We.
**Aelkarrimy**: We don't have the permit.
**Aelkarrimy**: And unless we get that, we.
**Aelkarrimy**: We can't.
**Aelkarrimy**: We can't start.
**Aelkarrimy**: And right now it looks like.
**Aelkarrimy**: It looks like, you know, if they got on and got the permit now, we would be starting essentially at the beginning of June.
**Bschwartz**: Brandon, question from my end.
**Bschwartz**: This is Brian from Henderson.
**Bschwartz**: Do you have submittals from your electrician already for those feeders?
**Bschwartz**: Do they have that stuff in?
**Bschwartz**: Because, I mean, if we're talking starting 6.1.
**Bschwartz**: UCK, we haven't even reviewed submittals.
**Bschwartz**: They still have to procure those feeders, the conduit, all that stuff.
**Bschwartz**: It's.
**Bschwartz**: That's a very accelerated schedule.
**Aelkarrimy**: So to answer your question, Brian, yes, we do have the submittals.
**Aelkarrimy**: That's what I had asked amid earlier.
**Aelkarrimy**: Who do I send these to?
**Aelkarrimy**: So we'll send those to you.
**Aelkarrimy**: As far as the lead time, I don't have that off the top of my head.
**Aelkarrimy**: Assuming that everything's approved, you know, we'll get it.
**Aelkarrimy**: But I.
**Aelkarrimy**: I can tell you right now it's not two weeks.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay, I understand.
**Bryan.wagar**: So, yeah, I will request you to do number 17 from first week of June, but please keep this schedule.
**Bryan.wagar**: So this schedule is realistic, right?
**Aelkarrimy**: Yes.
**Aelkarrimy**: And this is the.
**Aelkarrimy**: This is the most efficient way to do it.
**Aelkarrimy**: That's how we set these things up.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: And so may I ask, is there a reason you want this done the first week of June?
**Bryan.wagar**: Oh, this is because I'm going to visit the warehouse at site in early in June and what I wanted to see directly in my.
**Bryan.wagar**: In my eyes.
**Bryan.wagar**: So that's that.
**Bryan.wagar**: That's the reason I ask you.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: Do you know what.
**Aelkarrimy**: What day you're.
**Aelkarrimy**: You land here in the states and get on site.
**Bryan.wagar**: As of now, end of May to end of May to.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Like first week of June.
**Bryan.wagar**: Like that's.
**Aelkarrimy**: That's when you'll arrive six.
**Bryan.wagar**: Now arriving 26 or 27 and leaving five or six in June of June.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay, gotcha.
**Aelkarrimy**: So is it.
**Aelkarrimy**: Is it.
**Aelkarrimy**: Is it just that you want to see work or is there something about specifically this exact task?
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, if I could see exact task, it will be good.
**Aelkarrimy**: But Yuzuki, may I ask, you know, so this, this task right here.
**Aelkarrimy**: So.
**Aelkarrimy**: So new feeders.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: Do you actually know what.
**Aelkarrimy**: What that task is.
**Bryan.wagar**: Like bringing some panels and installing to where it should be?
**Aelkarrimy**: No.
**Aelkarrimy**: No.
**Aelkarrimy**: So this task are the feeders.
**Aelkarrimy**: So what that is, is.
**Aelkarrimy**: That's the metal pipe that's going to be going overhead along the edge of the building that we're going to run from the existing electrical room to the other, you know, panels that are going to drop now.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay, that.
**Aelkarrimy**: That's what feeders are like.
**Aelkarrimy**: That's all we're talking about is what is going to feed the panel.
**Aelkarrimy**: So that's why.
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay, so cable installation, cabling installation.
**Aelkarrimy**: So pulling the wire.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay, so that, that won't happen, I don't know, for a couple months probably.
**Aelkarrimy**: So we'll.
**Aelkarrimy**: We'll run all the conduit first and everything and set that.
**Aelkarrimy**: We set the panels, hook it together, and then we'll.
**Aelkarrimy**: We'll pull this wire like it's a big pool.
**Aelkarrimy**: They'll have a big tugger.
**Aelkarrimy**: And that.
**Aelkarrimy**: That'll happen.
**Aelkarrimy**: Now we won't have that wire, we won't install that until all that conduit and stuff is.
**Aelkarrimy**: Is installed.
**Aelkarrimy**: And frankly, you wouldn't see anything anyway because it's in a conduit.
**Aelkarrimy**: Like you wouldn't see wire getting pulled through it.
**Bclymer**: One sec.
**Bclymer**: One.
**Bclymer**: One quick question, Brandon.
**Bclymer**: And I think this will summarize you Suk's decision.
**Kevin.ly**: Once he hears this response.
**Bclymer**: If we were to accelerate the schedule to get these feeders and MDP panel and he won connect feeders like run and whatnot to 6:1, is that going to incur a cost?
**Bclymer**: Is this going to be a change order?
**Aelkarrimy**: Absolutely.
**Bclymer**: So, Yusuke, given that information that if we were to accelerate the schedule to 6:1, it would be a change order, are you okay with the change order at this time?
**Bclymer**: Do you want to see what that change order looks like, or do you.
**Aelkarrimy**: Not want to explore the change?
**Bryan.wagar**: I don't.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I don't want to have them change order so you can keep as it is, but if there's no changer, then you can accelerate.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I want to ask.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah, I understand.
**Aelkarrimy**: So anything that we can do that is not going to cost, you know, incur cost or, or make things out of order, then obviously we're going to try to help out and do that as much as we can.
**Aelkarrimy**: Now if you just want to be on site and, and see construction going on, then we can make sure you get some good pictures.
**Aelkarrimy**: And keep in mind we're going to have site supervision there.
**Aelkarrimy**: Mike's going to be there every day taking videos and pictures, and you're going to get all of those.
**Aelkarrimy**: So you're going to see exactly what's going on so you can report to your higher UPS and they can say, here's exactly what's going on, we know what it is, and you'll be fully abreast of the situation.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay, Got it.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: Any other questions?
**Aelkarrimy**: Is okay on the schedule here?
**Bclymer**: Are we still on schedule for the fence installation on 520?
**Aelkarrimy**: No, I mean we're gonna kick that, but I mean this.
**Aelkarrimy**: Do you not want to keep.
**Aelkarrimy**: Kick this back?
**Aelkarrimy**: This says 528.
**Aelkarrimy**: I presume that's something with operations or is that.
**Aelkarrimy**: Is there a reason?
**Bclymer**: I'm so sorry.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: So Yusuke, did you want the.
**Bclymer**: The fence to be installed on 5 28?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah, that will be my request.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yes.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Is that possible?
**Bryan.wagar**: It will affect you over a schedule.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Or the change orders or.
**Aelkarrimy**: No, that.
**Aelkarrimy**: That won't affect anything.
**Aelkarrimy**: I mean, keep in mind, you know, we were going to have to push that back anyway because we haven't got a permit yet.
**Aelkarrimy**: And so 520, we would have been there next week, which we're not going to have anything that there.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yes.
**Aelkarrimy**: So.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: So yeah, so that's not going to affect anything that material.
**Aelkarrimy**: It's not.
**Aelkarrimy**: We've already got it.
**Aelkarrimy**: It's in stock.
**Aelkarrimy**: It's not a big deal.
**Aelkarrimy**: So yeah, that's going to be pushed back.
**Aelkarrimy**: You know, when you're there, they'll.
**Aelkarrimy**: They'll probably be installing that.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay, I understand.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And which part will be affected by not getting permit?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: We have to update this schedule based on the permit received dates, right?
**Aelkarrimy**: Correct?
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah.
**Aelkarrimy**: So what?
**Aelkarrimy**: So, so I can update it every day, but it's kind of useless because we have no idea what we're doing.
**Aelkarrimy**: I'll.
**Aelkarrimy**: I'll update it real quick, you know, after this to project out.
**Aelkarrimy**: And so we'll say that we get permit now.
**Aelkarrimy**: I don't know.
**Aelkarrimy**: We'll say in the next week, the 23rd.
**Aelkarrimy**: And so that'll.
**Aelkarrimy**: That'll kick all of this logic, you know, these tasks down to reflect us getting that permit on that date.
**Bclymer**: Now Brandon, would.
**Bclymer**: Would we be able to pick up some pace during construction to kind of maintain that end date?
**Aelkarrimy**: As far as like are we able to.
**Aelkarrimy**: To decrease durations?
**Bclymer**: Like if things.
**Bclymer**: So certain things that are inflated, like 20 days or 40 days or 60 days or 70 days.
**Bclymer**: Would we be able.
**Bclymer**: Do you foresee us like down the line maybe being able to reduce those days?
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah, so.
**Aelkarrimy**: So like this 20 day item right here you're talking about.
**Aelkarrimy**: So yes, this feeder, it may.
**Aelkarrimy**: Maybe it takes us 15 days, you know, but maybe it takes us 25.
**Aelkarrimy**: Either way, it actually doesn't matter because the red items are actually what push your schedule out.
**Aelkarrimy**: These are what's called critical path, meaning that if these move, if this date, if this one right here moves like so if Joe is like, hey man, you know, tariffs, blah, blah, blah, we can't get, you know, racking because it's held up at customs.
**Aelkarrimy**: And so instead of starting at 8 4, he starts on 9 4.
**Aelkarrimy**: A whole month later, then that would push the entire project back a month because that is critical path.
**Aelkarrimy**: That's a day for day loss.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Gotcha.
**Mparsons**: Let's not just blame it.
**Mparsons**: Let's not blame it on Joe here.
**Aelkarrimy**: No, no, that was just.
**Aelkarrimy**: It's.
**Aelkarrimy**: We're just.
**Aelkarrimy**: We're just illustrating how important you are.
**Aelkarrimy**: Joe.
**Mparsons**: I got you.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, Brandon, I'm just gonna share my screen for a sec, just while we're at the topic of the fence.
**Bclymer**: So, Yusuke, I inputted the new background from exotic and Basically I have 19ft, 3 and 5 8th of an inch.
**Bclymer**: Are you saying that you want us to like, make, like leave a, like install like our fence 10ft away, or are we just butting up like we said to the existing fence?
**Bryan.wagar**: No, no, no.
**Bryan.wagar**: I mean, we're not using that white part because it is inside the construction fence, right?
**Bclymer**: Correct.
**Bryan.wagar**: So we are not using this one for our operation.
**Bryan.wagar**: We're not going into the construction fence inside.
**Bryan.wagar**: So we want the space outside of the construction face, which is left part.
**Bryan.wagar**: Like you said 15ft.
**Bryan.wagar**: Can you go to the left?
**Bryan.wagar**: That is.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, but what's going to happen here?
**Bclymer**: So you're saying you want something here to reduce this distance to 15ft.
**Bclymer**: But what is this piece?
**Bclymer**: Is this fencing?
**Bryan.wagar**: We're not putting any fences right there.
**Bryan.wagar**: We have a, you know, sublease fences, and that's it.
**Bryan.wagar**: We're not putting any construction fence.
**Aelkarrimy**: We're just tying into that.
**Aelkarrimy**: That fence.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: So that's what I'm showing right now.
**Bclymer**: So I, I, I.
**Bclymer**: Because Joe had the footprint of the subleased area right here.
**Bclymer**: So we put that in there.
**Bclymer**: And what we did was just add our fence around it.
**Bclymer**: But we saw that he was able to give us like from his survey, it was 19ft and 3 5,8 of an inch distance from fence.
**Aelkarrimy**: Keep in mind our pipes are 20, 21 foot sticks.
**Aelkarrimy**: So we're gonna need that space.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Aelkarrimy**: On the ends of the aisles.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: So this is.
**Bclymer**: This is.
**Bryan.wagar**: We're not going to the right side.
**Bclymer**: This is the right side.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, we're not touching that one because we're.
**Bryan.wagar**: It's not affecting to our operation.
**Bryan.wagar**: I'm talking about the left side.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yes, yes, yes.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I'm talking about the left side.
**Bclymer**: You want this to be 10ft?
**Bryan.wagar**: No, no, this is inside the construction phase.
**Bryan.wagar**: So we want the outside of the construction phase to keep 10ft.
**Aelkarrimy**: Gotcha.
**Aelkarrimy**: So you want to most.
**Aelkarrimy**: You want to move the construction fence instead of 15ft.
**Aelkarrimy**: And I think he wants that to be like 18 or 20, whatever that may be.
**Aelkarrimy**: Correct.
**Bryan.wagar**: This 15ft to like 10 or 12 or less.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Bryan.wagar**: You want to keep outside.
**Bryan.wagar**: Outside of the fence space.
**Kevin.ly**: I think he wants clear between the columns and the, and the fence.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah.
**Bryan.wagar**: Column and the fence.
**Bryan.wagar**: Right there.
**Bryan.wagar**: Those two.
**Bclymer**: Yes, I still, I.
**Bclymer**: I did, I did keep a nice distance for you.
**Bclymer**: Like you still have, I believe like 5ft or 10ft here all the way through between columns and then it's open in between.
**Bclymer**: But I mean, if you want to reduce it.
**Bclymer**: Joe, is there any concerns with us reducing this to 10ft?
**Mparsons**: I mean, Brandon, what's your thoughts here?
**Mparsons**: Because we are going to have to get forklift.
**Aelkarrimy**: I know.
**Mparsons**: And yeah, that's because that you're asking is going to go up before the sky pot is done being built.
**Mparsons**: So we will still have possibly some, you know, either it's piping or either it's racking.
**Mparsons**: You know, things are going to be stored up in that northern area and then traveled by forklift all the way down it.
**Mparsons**: I mean, 10ft gets kind of gets really tight.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah.
**Aelkarrimy**: It gives you no space.
**Aelkarrimy**: And think about not only with you standing up your racking heading that way, you know, if they're going to be setting it from right to left, like when they back up, that forklift for that rack is going to be issue.
**Aelkarrimy**: And then with us, you know, we have to feed that pipe, you know, from that end.
**Aelkarrimy**: And our pipes are going to be 20 foot long.
**Aelkarrimy**: I mean, 10 foot gives us no room to work through.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, I got that.
**Bryan.wagar**: But the first priority is not like making our normal operation effect.
**Bryan.wagar**: So it will be affecting to our, you know, operation in operation.
**Bryan.wagar**: In our warehouse.
**Bryan.wagar**: The forklifts have to be go through using this route to go the opposite side of the warehouse.
**Bschwartz**: Ahmed.
**Bschwartz**: The.
**Bschwartz**: The hatched area with the diagonal hatching, that's the Daifuku system, right?
**Bclymer**: I believe so, yes.
**Bschwartz**: So Yusuke, you've got 20ish feet between the Daifuku system and that column line to maintain your operations.
**Mparsons**: That's.
**Mparsons**: That's racking that part.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, that's the racking part, yeah.
**Bryan.wagar**: So we cannot go through just Part.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah, the gray is racking.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, some kind of racking, shelves, storage area.
**Bschwartz**: Oh, okay.
**Bschwartz**: My.
**Bschwartz**: My apologies.
**Bschwartz**: I didn't realize I was racking.
**Bclymer**: No, but the racking is the dashed line.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah, the racking's the dashed line.
**Bclymer**: This is just a not in contract area, so that's why it's a gray hatch.
**Bclymer**: But these are the, the actual like perimeters of the of like the Daifuku itself, like the daifuku conveyors to the column.
**Bclymer**: So you do have a distance there?
**Bryan.wagar**: No, no we don't.
**Bclymer**: Oh, you're saying like up here you guys have man the manual racks before the Daifuku like coming like down here?
**Bryan.wagar**: Some kind of.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, the manual racking.
**Bryan.wagar**: We moved some kind of, you know, storage kind of item with shelves and racks from this, you know, construction area to, you know, great hatch area.
**Bryan.wagar**: So we are kind of follow Suke.
**Bclymer**: So just keep in mind your request is going to impede a lot of issues here for the Aliato team and the exotic team.
**Bclymer**: If this is reduced to 10ft now you're limiting everything to have to go from one side of the space to the other.
**Bclymer**: And then it's going to be a challenge for them to really try to get overhead pipes over the ten foot fence in order to turn the pipe and get it through each of these aisles as needed.
**Bclymer**: So it's, it's going to.
**Bclymer**: It's not, it's not going to help us with production and maintaining schedule is what I'm hearing from everybody.
**Bryan.wagar**: No, I'm asking this like long time ago.
**Bryan.wagar**: So.
**Aelkarrimy**: Hey Yazuke.
**Mparsons**: Yep.
**Aelkarrimy**: What if we can we make that fence eight foot?
**Aelkarrimy**: Because then our first level is it.
**Aelkarrimy**: That gives us some wiggle room to, to be above the fence line with our pipes.
**Bryan.wagar**: Eight column two fence.
**Aelkarrimy**: No, no.
**Aelkarrimy**: Can we make the fence height eight foot instead of ten?
**Bryan.wagar**: I'm not sure.
**Bryan.wagar**: I have to confirm with our team because our team 10ft is appropriate height or the security point of view as.
**Aelkarrimy**: Far as security meaning like somebody climbing it or.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yes, something like that.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yes.
**Bryan.wagar**: Safety and security point of view.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So Yusuke, please try to confirm if eight foot fencing is acceptable is number one.
**Bclymer**: And then from there we'll attack if there's an issue with the ten foot.
**Bclymer**: Brandon, let us know what are the implications because I know that the logistics plan that was issued showed the 15ft.
**Bclymer**: So the 10 foot is a new request from last week's call.
**Bclymer**: So we'll try to accommodate if possible.
**Bclymer**: But let us know you Suke, if we can drop the side of the fence to be 8ft rather than 10ft.
**Bclymer**: This way it allows them to still complement what your warehouse needs and at the same time, construction needs.
**Bclymer**: So we need some wiggle room there and then.
**Bryan.wagar**: Sorry, I'm not asking this like from last week, by the way, when did.
**Bclymer**: You ask it, Suka?
**Bclymer**: Because I don't have any.
**Bclymer**: Any correspondence that says, hey, I want 10ft on this side.
**Bclymer**: This was all new.
**Bclymer**: The logistics plan that we ironed out together that was issued to Brandon and his team showed 15 foot on both sides.
**Bclymer**: But regardless, if you send me that email, I'll try to speak with Eliado and we'll see what we can do here.
**Bclymer**: But I don't.
**Bclymer**: I don't recall ten foot on this side.
**Bclymer**: So for now, please see if you can accommodate eight feet.
**Bclymer**: Just speak to the department, whoever you need to speak to to see if we can drop this down to 8ft.
**Bclymer**: This way, if we reduce to 10ft, it doesn't affect the first run of piping that needs to span through the shelving.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And then Joe, I sent you the backgrounds back.
**Bclymer**: Basically I cleaned it up with things I don't need and the extra lines, but I maintained all of the dimensions that I saw in your dwg.
**Bclymer**: So if you can just confirm so we can continue just adding the requirements for to the backgrounds, that would be great.
**Mparsons**: No, I was.
**Mparsons**: I.
**Mparsons**: I replied back that.
**Mparsons**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Oh, you did?
**Mparsons**: I'm sorry, My drawing.
**Mparsons**: I did it during like right at the beginning.
**Mparsons**: But what we show is 19ft from that fencing.
**Mparsons**: And yeah, I mean, you have it on the center line, which is the.
**Mparsons**: Which is the expansion joint.
**Mparsons**: And yeah, you're showing exactly what we're showing.
**Bclymer**: Excellent.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so then the next topic is for Yusuke, what I need from you, you took is the convenience outlets.
**Bclymer**: So if you use page three and four, it'll be useful for you because they're enlarged plans.
**Bclymer**: Per my discussions with Exotech, the printers are not really an Exotech product to be.
**Bclymer**: To really be specified here.
**Bclymer**: So right now we don't know where those printers fall within this area.
**Bclymer**: So whenever you can, just please send me a markup of where they plan on dropping within this area and then we'll accommodate.
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay.
**Bryan.wagar**: For the power printer, right?
**Bclymer**: Correct.
**Bclymer**: Correct.
**Bclymer**: Unless.
**Bclymer**: Unless this is something, Yousuke, that I wanted to also clarify.
**Bclymer**: Myself and Joe were talking and he was saying the labelers power is already accommodated through Exotech for the labelers.
**Bclymer**: So were you mistaking the labelers for printers?
**Bclymer**: Or are these like secondary things that need to Print like a secondary component.
**Bryan.wagar**: I'm not talking labor is a printer.
**Bryan.wagar**: It's separate one.
**Bclymer**: Got it.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Just wanted to confirm in case if there was any confusion there.
**Bclymer**: Okay, awesome.
**Bclymer**: And then the last thing.
**Bclymer**: All right, we already discussed the fence.
**Bclymer**: All right, I'll turn it back to you, Brendan.
**Bclymer**: But I think I covered just that email that I needed to go through.
**Aelkarrimy**: Perfect.
**Aelkarrimy**: So, yeah, so we'll look at that.
**Aelkarrimy**: You know, obviously we don't want to interrupt your operation is okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: We want you guys to be operational and profitable.
**Aelkarrimy**: So if you can look at that, let us know kind of what flexibility we have, you know, on the fence, that'd be helpful.
**Aelkarrimy**: And then obviously, with Mike's out there, we'll measure, you know, figure out what we need as far as aisle way to where you guys can get your forklifts and we can get our stuff in there with Joe's team.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay, thank you.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Vomit.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Have you sent me the cat file for the layouts?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I wanted to, you know, measure the fence to column.
**Bclymer**: It's in that link that I sent Joe on the bottom.
**Bclymer**: You could just download it from there.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, it's all there.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: You sent it yesterday.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Today.
**Bclymer**: No, like this.
**Mparsons**: Today.
**Bclymer**: Today, when I sent the schedule and the drawings to everybody.
**Bclymer**: To you and Joe, like six hours ago.
**Mparsons**: Yeah, I'm sending it again.
**Bryan.wagar**: Music.
**Aelkarrimy**: That's all I have.
**Aelkarrimy**: So, yeah, shoot us the engineer designer who gets what?
**Aelkarrimy**: Ahmed.
**Aelkarrimy**: And then we'll get that stuff pushed out to you guys and that way we can start sourcing materials and we'll.
**Aelkarrimy**: I'll.
**Aelkarrimy**: I'll update the schedule to reflect a permit date of next Friday being issued.
**Aelkarrimy**: That way everything can kick out and you can see what that looks like.
**Aelkarrimy**: Zuke, any questions?
**Bryan.wagar**: How can I see which part will.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Affected by the date of the received dates of the permit?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah, I can see the arrow part.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yep.
**Aelkarrimy**: So I'll show you here real quick.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah, so.
**Aelkarrimy**: So if you look here, right.
**Aelkarrimy**: So.
**Aelkarrimy**: So this is our permit review.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: So you can see the.
**Aelkarrimy**: The permit review.
**Aelkarrimy**: And then that arrow goes there to site mobilization, tip, fence install.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: And then everything builds off of that all the way down.
**Aelkarrimy**: Right.
**Aelkarrimy**: So our.
**Aelkarrimy**: Our four survey for remediation.
**Aelkarrimy**: All that is connected, all these arrows and goes down.
**Bryan.wagar**: All right.
**Bryan.wagar**: Right.
**Bryan.wagar**: I can see arrow for which item will be affected by permit dates.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yep, yep.
**Aelkarrimy**: So yeah, pretty much everything is going to.
**Aelkarrimy**: To kick back besides this, this four survey stuff, because that's not that.
**Aelkarrimy**: That's all done.
**Aelkarrimy**: That doesn't really affect the permit.
**Aelkarrimy**: That's why you see that?
**Aelkarrimy**: This way.
**Aelkarrimy**: But everything else that takes a trade license, which is mechanical, electrical, plumbing, all that stuff would be connected to that permit being issued.
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay.
**Bryan.wagar**: But some of the item can be perceived like, can prepare previously.
**Aelkarrimy**: Correct.
**Aelkarrimy**: Right, Like.
**Aelkarrimy**: So you're.
**Aelkarrimy**: You're for remediation?
**Aelkarrimy**: That.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, that part too.
**Aelkarrimy**: That can go.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yep.
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: Any other questions?
**Bryan.wagar**: Thank you.
**Aelkarrimy**: Kevin, you have any questions?
**Aelkarrimy**: No, nothing for me.
**Aelkarrimy**: Awesome.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay, thanks guys.
**Aelkarrimy**: Have a good week.
**Aelkarrimy**: And we'll.
**Aelkarrimy**: We'll talk next Wednesday.
**Bschwartz**: Hey, sorry.
**Bryan.wagar**: Thank you.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Thank you.
**Bryan.wagar**: For.
**Bryan.wagar**: Joseph.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yes, Joseph, can you hold up?
**Mparsons**: Yeah, I was gonna say the same thing.
**Aelkarrimy**: Oh, sorry.
**Aelkarrimy**: What'd you need, Joe?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Nothing.
**Aelkarrimy**: I was gonna talk to you.
**Mparsons**: Zuka, tell them to hang on for a minute.
**Aelkarrimy**: Oh, okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: Perfect.
**Bschwartz**: Yeah, I wasn't sure if we wanted to discuss the.
**Bschwartz**: The site visits.
**Bclymer**: Oh, it is a good idea to discuss the site visits because I know that you kind of need to elaborate on like how we're help, like the cost effectiveness and so.
**Bclymer**: So Yusuke, what you.
**Bclymer**: What you and I discussed when it came to the site visits for Henderson vs.
**Bclymer**: TPG, Brian reviewed the areas that.
**Bclymer**: The points that you and I kind of went through and we said, hey, this makes sense for Henderson to go to.
**Bclymer**: So I sent the request to Henderson, but Brian came back with, you know, yes, we can do this, but it's kind of wasteful for you because it's going to be costly.
**Bclymer**: So they believe that there's ways that they can help you save on the costs for the site visits.
**Bclymer**: So Brian, I'll let you kind of just walk it through.
**Bschwartz**: Yeah, sorry.
**Bschwartz**: I'm trying to find that.
**Bschwartz**: That schedule that you had sent me.
**Bschwartz**: But essentially, Zuke, instead of coming out for both the FHIR main and the system, the system B at separate times, we would just come out once that B system is complete and we'll be able to review the mains and the system B install at the same time.
**Bschwartz**: And then similarly, instead of having a separate system, a trip and a final punch trip, we would just review the system A installation at the time of our.
**Bschwartz**: Our final, final punch for fire.
**Bschwartz**: Yeah, I think that was mainly.
**Bschwartz**: I think we're.
**Bschwartz**: We're fine with the added mid construction visit on the MEP side though.
**Bschwartz**: Does that make sense?
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay, I'm not sure.
**Bryan.wagar**: How.
**Bryan.wagar**: How do we add to the schedule for Henderson's visit?
**Bryan.wagar**: Like five times?
**Bschwartz**: Yeah, so there.
**Bschwartz**: I think.
**Bschwartz**: I think it was five total visits that you were requesting.
**Bschwartz**: We already have one included in our original proposal, so it would be four.
**Bschwartz**: Four additional ones.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Bryan.wagar**: Additional Four.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: One is planned in the last, like the final inspection.
**Bschwartz**: Yeah, we have all the construction.
**Bschwartz**: Yep.
**Bschwartz**: We have been planned for the end of construction to do a final punch walk.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Bryan.wagar**: And you're saying that.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: That That's.
**Bryan.wagar**: That's enough or it should be as.
**Bschwartz**: Several times or I'm saying.
**Bschwartz**: So the final we can use to cover original.
**Bryan.wagar**: Original cost, right?
**Bschwartz**: Yeah, the final under the.
**Bschwartz**: Is included under the original cost.
**Bschwartz**: And then.
**Bschwartz**: Okay, if.
**Bschwartz**: If you want us to be out there an additional time, we can do a mid construction visit for both FIRE and MEP instead of doing five, the four additional visits.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So I mean, two additional.
**Bschwartz**: It would just be.
**Bschwartz**: Well, it either be two additional or it'd be one additional for two people.
**Bschwartz**: But yeah, either way you want to look at it.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Bschwartz**: Sorry, I can't find that PDF.
**Bschwartz**: Ahmed, do you have that handy?
**Bclymer**: I think so.
**Bclymer**: I.
**Bclymer**: I don't have a PDF.
**Bclymer**: Oh, oh, that PDF.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: One second.
**Bclymer**: Schedules.
**Kevin.ly**: Uniqlo, schedules construction.
**Kevin.ly**: It's kind of based off of the old one, so.
**Bschwartz**: Oh, I found it.
**Bschwartz**: Nevermind.
**Bryan.wagar**: It's.
**Bclymer**: It's still.
**Bschwartz**: You got to.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Kevin.ly**: So from the coordination.
**Kevin.ly**: So the open circles is site visits for Henderson, and those closed circles are for tpg.
**Kevin.ly**: So over here we have that you want Henderson to be on site and like in between these dates for the fire sprinkler main feeds, the runs.
**Bclymer**: And.
**Kevin.ly**: Then you have them again for the installation of the power, for the power of the air compressor, and then for detailing of Skypod B and then detailing of Skypod A.
**Kevin.ly**: And then there's a final visit for both consultants, us and Henderson.
**Bschwartz**: So Yasuke, we would take.
**Bschwartz**: We would take 22 and we'd combine it with 31 and then we take 37 and combine it with the final visit.
**Bschwartz**: And that would cut down on the number of times.
**Kevin.ly**: So it would be a total of three visits, right, Brian?
**Bschwartz**: Yeah.
**Bschwartz**: And.
**Bschwartz**: And we can even combine 28 and 22 and 31 at the same time too.
**Bschwartz**: 28 will be MEP only.
**Bschwartz**: And then 22 and 31 are fire, so we'd have to have separate people for that.
**Bschwartz**: But we could do all.
**Bschwartz**: All three of those at the same time, make one visit and then send two people out again at the end of the project for a final visit and just do it in two as well.
**Kevin.ly**: Now Brian, you don't think that maybe there should be one as like just in case if there's a problem on site or something that needs like our attention on site.
**Kevin.ly**: So like for tpg, what I did, instead of just Having the three that.
**Bclymer**: Are required, I.
**Bclymer**: I added eight.
**Kevin.ly**: Just in case if you suke during.
**Bclymer**: The year asks, hey, I need you.
**Kevin.ly**: To go to site and take a look at something.
**Kevin.ly**: We can still kind of go there.
**Bschwartz**: I can.
**Bschwartz**: I can put an alt in our.
**Bschwartz**: Our proposal for an emergency visit if you want.
**Bschwartz**: Just.
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah, yeah, I think just to play it safe, we should have one extra.
**Bschwartz**: Just combining.
**Bschwartz**: Sorry, just combining Those work for you in that manner.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, I think.
**Bryan.wagar**: But as Ahmed said, we want to put some kind of emergency visit just in case.
**Bschwartz**: Yeah, I'll.
**Bschwartz**: I'll.
**Bschwartz**: I'll combine 22, 28 and 31.
**Bschwartz**: So we'll send two people out mid construction, probably after system B is installed.
**Bschwartz**: That'll give us a chance to review all the MEP items, the fire sprinkler mains and the system B install.
**Bschwartz**: And then we'll send someone out.
**Bschwartz**: We'll send two people out at the.
**Bschwartz**: At the end for the final.
**Bschwartz**: And we'll review pretty much everything at that point.
**Bschwartz**: And then I'll also include an additional visit just in case something comes up.
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay, I understand it.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Can you.
**Bryan.wagar**: Can you give us the proposal for two options?
**Bryan.wagar**: One is the original our request one, and the second one is your proposal one is combining some of the items that.
**Bschwartz**: Yep.
**Bryan.wagar**: In those ways.
**Bryan.wagar**: Emergency visit.
**Bschwartz**: Yep.
**Bschwartz**: Okay.
**Bschwartz**: Yeah, I'll do that.
**Kevin.ly**: Thanks, Brian.
**Bclymer**: I'm also just.
**Kevin.ly**: Just so you know, I'm sending an email right now to the Aliato team with the represent representatives for shop drawings.
**Kevin.ly**: And I just highlighted the area where I just want you to add Henderson's representatives.
**Bschwartz**: Okay.
**Kevin.ly**: And then you should be good to go there.
**Bschwartz**: Yep.
**Kevin.ly**: And then Yusuke, one last item.
**Kevin.ly**: I sent you the proposals for the special inspection agencies.
**Bclymer**: I sent you originals.
**Bclymer**: And then the negotiation.
**Bclymer**: I'm sorry, what cross check is that?
**Bclymer**: I sent you cross check and I sent you Damani.
**Bclymer**: And I'm still waiting for Turkon.
**Kevin.ly**: But you have the originals from both of those from those two agencies.
**Kevin.ly**: And then what I was able to negotiate with the two.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Bryan.wagar**: I haven't seen your email yet, but which one is the cheapest?
**Bclymer**: They're both.
**Bclymer**: They're both expensive is what I'm pissed about.
**Kevin.ly**: And they're both about $12,000.
**Kevin.ly**: So I'm.
**Kevin.ly**: I'm hoping that Terracon is much cheaper because they're in the heart of Jersey, so it's easier.
**Kevin.ly**: So I will still try to attack and get one of those proposals from them.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: All right, thanks.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Thank you.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Kevin.ly**: Okay.
**Kevin.ly**: All right, we'll let you guys be.
**Kevin.ly**: Thank you guys.
**Kevin.ly**: So much.
**Bschwartz**: Thanks, everyone.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Thank you.
**Bryan.wagar**: Joseph.
**Bryan.wagar**: I just wanted to ask you the, the overall schedule.
**Mparsons**: Yep.
**Bryan.wagar**: As of now.
**Mparsons**: Correct.
**Bryan.wagar**: Is it possible to send it right now or.
**Jdawson**: You.
**Mparsons**: You should have.
**Mparsons**: You don't have to like cleat clean.
**Mparsons**: No, you haven't.
**Mparsons**: You have.
**Bryan.wagar**: Oh, yeah, I have it.
**Bryan.wagar**: Oh, really?
**Mparsons**: Yeah.
**Mparsons**: And did you see that.
**Mparsons**: The meeting.
**Mparsons**: Did you see the meeting in 15 minutes?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: You emailed me.
**Mparsons**: Yep.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Oh, this is.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: This is the same schedule as Aliato.
**Mparsons**: Let me see.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: We're.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: No, no, no.
**Aelkarrimy**: You.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: You send it me.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: 15.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Oh, okay, okay, okay, I got it.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I got it.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: You send it both.
**Mparsons**: Yeah, well, yeah, well, I forwarded it because we were talking.
**Mparsons**: I forward.
**Mparsons**: You sent you Ahmed's email so you can get the.
**Mparsons**: The drawing.
**Mparsons**: But yeah, the one right before that has the Excel document that I showed you the other week.
**Mparsons**: And then it also has the Ms.
**Mparsons**: Project schedule as of today.
**Mparsons**: And I, and I.
**Mparsons**: And I added in all of Aliato stuff as well, so they're all linked together.
**Mparsons**: Oh, and then I didn't see if.
**Mparsons**: I didn't see you accepted at all.
**Mparsons**: But there is a call in 15 minutes to go over your floor with Cokery.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yep, yep, yep.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I know.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: I just want.
**Mparsons**: I want to make sure you saw that because it's.
**Mparsons**: It's a very important phone call.
**Mparsons**: There's a lot of information.
**Mparsons**: We've been going back and forth this entire week to get a better solution.
**Mparsons**: I'm going to let them do a little more explaining than me because we've been really picking apart our environmental specs to try to get the cheapest option for you.
**Mparsons**: So we have kind of a plan.
**Mparsons**: It's not the greatest news.
**Mparsons**: I do want to warn you, it's not the best news.
**Mparsons**: It will keep schedule.
**Mparsons**: That's the good news.
**Mparsons**: But it is going to require the team to be.
**Mparsons**: To do another survey.
**Mparsons**: It's even.
**Mparsons**: It's going to be a longer survey and longer.
**Mparsons**: Well, it'll be like three days instead of a day and a half.
**Mparsons**: But it will.
**Aelkarrimy**: It will have.
**Mparsons**: Yeah, well, not.
**Mparsons**: They did the friction test today.
**Aelkarrimy**: I don't.
**Mparsons**: We don't have the results yet, but they are out doing the.
**Mparsons**: We'll better explain it.
**Mparsons**: Basically, their initial survey, they did the rows.
**Mparsons**: They use a profiler graph.
**Mparsons**: They can see how the rack feet are going to be.
**Mparsons**: The big concern is that you have a lot of big dips in this floor and that causes.
**Mparsons**: Okay, yeah, it causes a really big concern.
**Mparsons**: We have.
**Mparsons**: They have something that they can show you as well.
**Mparsons**: A big graph here.
**Mparsons**: But I wanted to.
**Mparsons**: And if you had a couple minutes I, I'd like if we can do our meeting so we don't have to do our meeting later at 7.
**Mparsons**: Was it 7:30?
**Mparsons**: That kind of be best.
**Mparsons**: But I can show you a few things real quick.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: So this is, this is a map of your floor.
**Mparsons**: This is what was in the initial proposal without the yellow marks.
**Mparsons**: So in, in reviewing the documentation for.
**Mparsons**: Let me pull it up for your requirements.
**Mparsons**: The profile of graph covers this.
**Mparsons**: So this is in between the racking and this is you know, vertical and horizontal.
**Mparsons**: So their profiler graph gets set to these parameters.
**Mparsons**: They walk down the aisle, they can make sure that everything is under 4 millimeters on an aisle.
**Mparsons**: What they can't do with this profile graph is determine requirement number 21.
**Mparsons**: The altitude shall be maximum of 20 millimeters every 10 meters for all rack surface.
**Mparsons**: Now for a traditional floor, this really isn't hard to get get.
**Mparsons**: You know normally you see this, you know this is, this is a big change in elevation.
**Bryan.wagar**: So 20 mm every 10 meter.
**Mparsons**: Okay, correct.
**Mparsons**: So this chart and I just put, I just pasted it into fix this that I had open.
**Mparsons**: But this chart shows these only per three meter, right?
**Mparsons**: Yeah.
**Mparsons**: So these numbers are in a three meter grid.
**Mparsons**: So every three meters they took measurements just to get this.
**Mparsons**: So you can see the undulation of the floor.
**Mparsons**: So as you can see here, negative 22 and over here 6.
**Mparsons**: So again every 3 is pretty much, we can call it 10 meters.
**Mparsons**: It's about, it's 9 meter 9 meters.
**Mparsons**: But everywhere that's yellow has hey, from here to here or from here to here or here it's more than 20.
**Mparsons**: So what's happening is they know, okay, somewhere in this area it needs to be lowered in this box.
**Mparsons**: But because it's a three meter grid, they don't know exactly where.
**Mparsons**: So what they're proposing and I'll let them go more into it in a couple minutes, but what they're proposing is to come back out.
**Mparsons**: It will be another charge.
**Mparsons**: But they're, but they said they're willing to come back out if it can just be added to the remediation.
**Mparsons**: So basically right now when this first came out, they basically said with this dip and you know how tall it goes from about 18, 12, 10 all the way down to 22.
**Mparsons**: The first immediate recommendation is to just screed the floor.
**Mparsons**: They said this, this actually is not a great floor by any means because of how low it dips in these spots, especially here.
**Mparsons**: As well too.
**Mparsons**: Their initial is a let's screed.
**Mparsons**: Well, screening is for this amount of space is anywhere between probably $600,000 and $750,000, which I know you said there is a tight budget for this.
**Mparsons**: So this week we've been saying, hey, okay, what other options do we have?
**Mparsons**: What else can we do?
**Mparsons**: Let's pick apart our, basically our environmental specs and see how we can avoid doing a screed.
**Mparsons**: So at this moment, what screed means grinding.
**Mparsons**: Screed means laying a new floor over like topping slab.
**Mparsons**: Yes.
**Mparsons**: So what they do is they come and.
**Mparsons**: And the thing is it's done very quickly, but all the cost is in the material.
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay.
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: So, yeah, what happens is they would board this up.
**Mparsons**: I think they would board it up and then they would come in with the liquid.
**Mparsons**: Yep.
**Mparsons**: They would just pour it.
**Mparsons**: Yep.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: They pour it.
**Mparsons**: It lay flat and then you're, you know, you're perfectly flat.
**Mparsons**: So the recommend.
**Mparsons**: The recommendation.
**Mparsons**: Yeah, the recommendation that they're giving us right now that we're kind of like, all right, our, our only other option is to come back out.
**Mparsons**: They already said they have a team that they can send out on Monday.
**Mparsons**: They can have two guys out on Monday.
**Mparsons**: And instead of a three meter grid like this, they're going to do a one meter grid.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Mparsons**: And that's what's going to minimize.
**Bryan.wagar**: Minimize the.
**Mparsons**: Yes.
**Mparsons**: They're going to go every one meter and take a measurement so they can figure out exactly where the areas are that they need to grind so that they can keep it.
**Mparsons**: Keep it flat.
**Mparsons**: Because what happens is we have these.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I don't know if I have it open.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I hope I do.
**Mparsons**: Yes, I do.
**Mparsons**: Perfect.
**Mparsons**: So we have our rows and the issue is they can't tell.
**Mparsons**: They can tell like, hey, I need to grind here on this side.
**Mparsons**: So obviously, like when you zoom in, this is right side and left side.
**Mparsons**: So they know this is higher than this side.
**Mparsons**: So that has to be to make this level for the racking.
**Mparsons**: What they can't tell is they can't tell if the elevation from here goes to high over here.
**Mparsons**: So that would be the 1 meter grid to make sure that they know exactly where all these high points are, that they can grind this whole floor to make sure that it is level.
**Mparsons**: Because the issue is once you put up all this racking, if it leans, it's that that's what causes.
**Mparsons**: And then you can't.
**Mparsons**: And then it'll buckle.
**Mparsons**: And that's why the environmental specs, you Know that's why it's not possible to.
**Bryan.wagar**: Absorb those differences by the rack.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Like putting some shim plates under the base plate or something.
**Mparsons**: They do that in the back, they do that here on these back feet.
**Mparsons**: But the front feet because the robot has to engage on both sides.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: So if you shim one of these on the front when the robot engages, it'll be here, it'll be on like you know, peg one, but on here it'll be on peg negative one.
**Mparsons**: And then it will be uneven as it climbs.
**Mparsons**: So basically these, these half the front.
**Mparsons**: That's why all, that's why the level litness is very important is the front feet lay flat on the ground, the back can adjust.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: So we are going to go over that.
**Mparsons**: Other than that, is there anything else you want to go over with me?
**Mparsons**: Yuzuka and maybe we can, we can scratch the.
**Mparsons**: The later call today.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay, But Joe, you shared the specification from exotic to colgreen, right?
**Mparsons**: Correct, correct.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So 20 said 20 mm within 10 meter is also included in our instruction to Calgary.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And their report doesn't.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Doesn't show like.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Well that's those requirement is not those requirements could not you know, check by their report is.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Is that the Calgary sport in my understanding.
**Mparsons**: So what Kogre is saying is hey, we did it in a 3 meter span.
**Mparsons**: Like if all these numbers, if we, if you didn't have these highlighted numbers, these in basically in.
**Mparsons**: In orange.
**Mparsons**: If you didn't have these super low spots and some of these other ones like the 13s.
**Mparsons**: This floor, we would say this floor is fine.
**Mparsons**: It never has a 20 millimeter difference which a 20 million.
**Mparsons**: I mean to be honest, a 20 millimeter difference according to Kogary is.
**Mparsons**: It's hard to come by and I don't know when this floor was laid.
**Mparsons**: I don't know how long ago it was.
**Mparsons**: Like how do you know how old the building is?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: But I think they have to prepare to, you know, understand that.
**Mparsons**: I mean this, this is, this is an attempt to not have to scream like we're trying to make it so we can grind because grinding takes longer but it is much, much cheaper.
**Bryan.wagar**: And this is, this is again to.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Reduce the area which we have to grind.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So that's.
**Mparsons**: They're not trying to reduce the area we have to grind.
**Mparsons**: They're trying to figure out the exact area that does need to be ground so that they can give an accurate quote and do this accurately based on this findings.
**Mparsons**: Their initial.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah but they have to do that.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: In the first time Isn't.
**Mparsons**: Yes and no.
**Mparsons**: Yes and yes and no.
**Mparsons**: Basically they're, they're right now they're saying screed the floor.
**Mparsons**: So their recommendation is hey, we did our survey.
**Mparsons**: This is the undulation is more than 20 meters.
**Mparsons**: 20 millimeters.
**Mparsons**: They can see that their recommendation is the screed the floor.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Oh my God.
**Mparsons**: Okay, option two is to do a more in depth survey.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Come and survey again.
**Mparsons**: Come and survey again on a 1 meter grid instead of 3 meters.
**Mparsons**: And they can better find hopefully find the spots that can be ground and then they can get a cheaper quote than screedy.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: But in the worst case they come survey again and they request us again for screening.
**Mparsons**: That's worst case.
**Mparsons**: Yes.
**Mparsons**: I mean you can ask their, their, their confidence level that they can avoid screening.
**Mparsons**: But yeah, a 3 meter grid, they can tell that it does drop over 20 millimeters.
**Mparsons**: Within 10 millimeter.
**Mparsons**: Within 10 meters.
**Mparsons**: They can see it, it does it within 9 meters.
**Mparsons**: So their recommendation is if you don't, if you want to attempt and try to avoid screening they'd have to do a more in depth survey to accurately know hey, we can grind here and grind here and grind here and make all the specs meet.
**Bryan.wagar**: I got this.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I understand the situation.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: So I'm gonna let them talk a little more.
**Mparsons**: Let's hop on that other call in two minutes.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: And they'll, they can better answer some questions for you.
**Bryan.wagar**: All right.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Is there like technicians, like engineers for robots coming?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Because this is related to the robots, right?
**Mparsons**: This is related to the racking and the robots turbos.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I think we have to ask you for absorbing by your side too in several portion.
**Mparsons**: And that like we can.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Make like very perfect floor, you know.
**Mparsons**: We know but that, and that's why the 20 millimeters.
**Mparsons**: I mean that it is a big difference.
**Mparsons**: I mean most floors and you can let them tell you like most floors are not does not have that kind of undulation in it.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Join emm.
**Mparsons**: But let's, let's jump over to that one.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: We'll continue this conversation.
**Bryan.wagar**: Right?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Correct.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
