## Overview
- Goodwill Bloomington project review by accounting lacked Ashley's previous notes, impacting billing accuracy.
- Project Status Report (PSR) system now in use, replacing Procore; monthly submissions critical for project managers like AJ and Nick.
- Change order reviews allow budget manipulation without altering overall contract amount; important for project financial management.
- Current sync date essential for accurate data display; open change events and PCCOs must be verified with Job Planner.
- Sub billing totals must match PSR figures to avoid cash flow discrepancies, as seen with $251,690 in approved subcontractor pay apps.
- Cash flow management emphasized; job-to-date costs shouldn‚Äôt exceed the previous month's billing to prevent negative cash flow.
- Illustrative example showed $44,000 job-to-date cost vs. $31,000 billing leading to a $12,000 negative cash flow until next payment.
- New tracking fields added to Excel to improve efficiency, including current fee, insurance, contingency, and job costs.
- Future process expansion to include tracking for RFIs and submittals, enhancing project oversight.
- Ashley to practice on 2-3 projects for familiarization before Jessie‚Äôs accuracy review, improving the workflow.

## Short Summary
The meeting reviewed the Goodwill Bloomington project, highlighting the absence of Ashley's previous notes which affected billing accuracy. The Project Status Report (PSR) system has replaced Procore, requiring monthly submissions from project managers like AJ and Nick to ensure financial transparency. Change order reviews were discussed as a method for budget manipulation without changing the overall contract amount, which is crucial for financial management. The importance of syncing current data was emphasized, particularly verifying open change events with the Job Planner. To avoid cash flow issues, sub billing totals must align with PSR figures, as demonstrated by the $251,690 in approved subcontractor pay applications. Effective cash flow management is critical, with job costs needing to remain under the previous month's billing, illustrated by a $12,000 negative cash flow example. New tracking fields in Excel aim to enhance efficiency, with future expansions planned to include RFIs and submittals. Ashley will practice on several projects to prepare for Jessie‚Äôs accuracy review.

## Meeting Gist
The meeting focused on the Goodwill Bloomington project review and introduced new tracking systems for better financial management.

## Key Points (Shorthand)
üëã **Meeting Setup & Initial Context** (02:44 - 05:20)
Meeting began with casual greetings and discussion about Jesse's rescheduled huddle for Uniqlo project.
Ashley shared her screen to review billing numbers and invoices, noting that Goodwill Bloomington project appeared to have been reviewed by accounting with her previous notes removed.
üìä **Introduction to PSR System** (09:08 - 13:25)
Jesse introduced the Project Status Report (PSR) system located in executive folder structure, explaining these are monthly reports submitted by project managers like AJ and Nick.
PSR contains critical project data including: Project Name, projected start/completion dates, contract budget, original fee, and original insurance.
System uses Job Planner software instead of previous Procore system, causing terminology differences between 'change events' vs 'change requests'. 
üìã **Contract and Budget Verification Process** (13:25 - 17:53)
Demonstrated Neiman Foods project example showing contract verification process using schedule of values: insurance ($6,919), contingency ($10,000), contractor fee ($50,744).
Explained change order review process where $0 total change orders can still move money within budget categories without changing overall contract amount.
Budget tracking focuses on revised budget columns showing changes in: contract fees, contingency amounts, unallocated costs, and insurance.
üîÑ **Critical Sync and Data Validation** (18:12 - 21:02)
Emphasized importance of sync date being current or close to review date to ensure accurate data display.
Reviewed open change events and PCCOs (Project Change Control Orders) requiring verification against Job Planner reports.
üí∞ **Billing Reconciliation Process** (21:11 - 26:33)
Explained sub billing total verification process comparing PSR figures to Job Planner approved invoices, using example of $251,690 in approved subcontractor pay apps.
Clarified that job cost to date from project budget should be used for comparison, including all GC costs (labor, dumpsters, project management).
Described cash flow management principle where job-to-date costs should never exceed previous month's billing to avoid negative cash flow situations.
‚è≥ **Payment Timing and Cash Flow Management** (24:45 - 27:29)
Explained typical one-month payment lag where costs incurred in current month are covered by previous month's billing.
Used example showing $44,000 job-to-date cost vs $31,000 May billing, resulting in $12,000 negative cash flow until July payment.
Discussed positive cash flow example where July billing of $360,000 covered only $142,000 in costs, creating $200,000 positive position.
üìà **Excel Worksheet Enhancement** (28:47 - 34:21)
Jesse guided Ashley through adding new tracking fields to existing Excel worksheet including: current fee, current insurance, current contingency, current profit, sub billing total, job to date costs, open PCCOs, and open change requests.
Established workflow where Ashley will populate Job Planner data into Excel sheet, allowing Jesse to quickly compare against PSR submissions for efficient review process.
üîÆ **Future Expansion Plans** (34:08 - 35:06)
Mentioned future addition of open RFIs and open submittals tracking to the review process.
Ashley committed to practicing on 2-3 projects before requesting Jesse's review for accuracy verification.


## Bullet Points Summary
üíº Goodwill Project Review: Ashley‚Äôs previous notes were missing, affecting billing accuracy for the Goodwill Bloomington project.
üìä New PSR System: The Project Status Report system is now in use, requiring monthly updates from project managers.
üí∞ Change Order Reviews: Change order reviews allow budget adjustments without affecting the overall contract amount.
üîÑ Cash Flow Management: Maintaining cash flow is crucial; job costs must not exceed last month's billing.
üìà Improved Tracking: New Excel fields added for better tracking of project costs and future expansions planned.

## Transcript

**Jesse Dawson:**
Hello, Ashley. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Hello, Jesse. I was wondering when you were going to join. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
How's the weather there today? 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Yeah, I forgot about your huddle. How did that go? 

**Jesse Dawson:**
They reprogrammed it till two. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Oh, okay, that sounds good. Which project is it on? 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Uniqlo. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Okay. Okay, let me go ahead and share my screen. Okay, perfect. And then I have your head right here. Okay. So what exactly did you want to review on this? So I went ahead and I looked at the numbers. I looked at the numbers for the owner, billings and the sub. Did you want me to go ahead and make more notes of things that we have to review? Like, for example, this number or so all the information is inserted and accurate, but I just want to make sure I'm on the same page as, like, what you need done. Should we go with one at a time? This is Goodwill Bloomington. Though, when we reviewed yesterday, it looks as if they reviewed it themselves. Like accounting, because I left two notes right here and they're gone. And now it says. And now it says, just this one is under review. Did you want me to look on any invoicing? Let me know. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
We're not approving that invoice. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
This one. Right. McKay's in son. The Bloomington. This is Mint. Yeah, it just still says under review. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Sorry, one second. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
No, you're all good right now. I'm just going through them, making sure everything looks good. What are you looking at right now? The invoicing. Jesse, are you frozen? 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Oh, I'm typing here. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Okay. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Okay. All right, so now, so if you. I'm going to show you a couple things here. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Okay. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
And this. Do you have access to this file folder here? 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Yes, I said I should have access to it. Let me go ahead and look at it at the same time as you. Show me your screen. Yeah, because it literally just says executive. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Just executive. Yeah, that's the one. And then inside of it, do you see this folder? 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
The psr? 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Yes. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Yeah, I usually see it. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Okay. And then inside that, there's this folder. And this is for the month. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Oh, July and August. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
So you go on this folder. I'm slowly. I got to get through all of these. But when I review one I created in here, and that's what I review and markup. So, Neiman, this one here is the one I currently have open. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Oh, that's what you were looking at. These are the sub invoices. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
This is called a psr, which stands for Project Status Report. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Right. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Okay, that makes sense. Each project, when they started, they'd fill in this information here, which is Project Name, projected start date, projected completion date, contract, budget and original fee. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Okay. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Okay. Yeah then. So all these things are what we're tracking. So the first time of the job and I thought it should have original insurance too. Not sure why that I thought that line was up there. Yeah. So he deleted a line here for some reason, but it should have original fee, original insurance. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Here in the August 2025 Applied Engineering. So this is what you edit. So this is what, this is what eventually I will help you edit. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
So. Well, what I don't, I don't need you to really edit it, but you're going to make me a cheat sheet to allow me to review all these in like lickety split. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Okay. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Because currently. So I will take. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Because you don't. To like save you on time because you don't have the time to go look at it and do this. It just takes too much time and you already have a lot on your plate. So my job would just to be look at the. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Well, let me walk it through you to show you what I need, if that makes sense. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Yes. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
So I'm just explaining to you what is on this report and then I'll go through the information I look at to compare to this to see if it's right. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Got it? Okay, sounds good. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
So yeah, so here it's contract, budget, original fee, and then original insurance should be on here. So then I go to. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
And these are what all the guys, these are the PSRs, they submit. So AJ, Nick, everybody who has their project submits this by the end of. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
The week and each month. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Oh yeah. At the end of each month. Yes. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Yep. So. So this is Neiman Foods in Job Planner. This is Neiman Foods here. So in Job Planner, first thing on there like. And once it's. Once the first one's done, it is what it is. But this is the contract for Neiman's. You know where the contracts are, right? 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Yes. Yeah. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
So in this schedule of values for this contract tells you insurance was 69 19, contingency was 10,000 and the contractor fee was 50,000 5,744. So all those are. Yeah, the insurance is. Right. So these are the things that from here down that I'll go look and just look at to confirm. So as of this date he's saying the contract amount hasn't changed and the current fee hasn't changed. So back here you look at, you can look at this. But change orders here, there's two of them, $0. So if there's two change orders, doesn't matter. How many there are. But if it's $0 is the total of the grand total, then this is. Right. Contract amount has stayed the same. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Got it. And will they be adding amounts to those change orders? I am trying to understand why they're there. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Well, they're there because he did a couple things. You can either. Let's see where we at here. In this case, you open up this change order, you look at its schedule of values. There's deducts and adds in between the two. It equals zero. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Got it. Got it. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
So you can have a change order that costs zero, but it's simply moving money within the budget. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Oh, got it. Got it. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Okay. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
And that's where it shows you. Okay. Got it. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Yeah. If you open it up, if you're curious, that's where it is. So back to this thing. So that's all that's. You know, you're just checking contract amounts. Right. Fees. Right. Insurance is. Right. And you look at that. This is in the budget. That's one of the big things you look at. You look at down here at the end. You can see this column here. Revised budget. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Yeah. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
So it hasn't changed contract fees. The same contingency has gone down. Unallocated costs has gone up. And insurance is the same. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Yeah. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
So those numbers, you just look at those. That matches. Unallocated cost is this much, 19,000. Contingencies down to 4,400. Remaining buyout is just something which I don't want to get into that detail, but right. The. And then current projected profits, the same right there. So. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Right. Okay. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Like those are all things. Like you can just check on a spreadsheet when you go in, when you look at these budgets. And then one other important thing is this sync date. It has to be synced. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Okay. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
To. To be correct, or else it just doesn't show everything. So you want to make sure this sync is the day you're looking at it or close to it. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Right? Yeah. Like, make sure it's not too far. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
So. So we got all those. And then next item here, where is it? There's open change events, not in a pco. So in this case, I printed out open change events. He's got one here. But actually all the change orders are. These are change requests from the report approved. I mean, there's no oops. So change is here. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
And these, these green boxes are your edits. Like your comments. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Just comments. Yeah. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
And then after your comments, they review it and they fix it. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Oh, they're gonna have to fix it the following month. Typically, unless you can get the comments out before the last day of the month. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Yeah, which. Which is a little unlikely. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
I have to fix it the next month. But. So this here, like where you find that information though, is this change request. I need to change that worksheet. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
But what do you mean change that worksheet? 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Because it says. It says cell. Because I was used to Procore is change events instead of change requests and job Planner. It's the same thing, but next things open PCOS and pccos. This here. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
What. What does CE stand for? 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Change event. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Okay. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
And change request is the same thing. It's just different between Job Planner and Procore. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Oh, okay. Okay. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
So we don't use Procore anymore. So that's why it's got the old terminology there. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Makes sense. Makes sense. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
So back to this. So this, the other thing that you'll be checking is sub billing, total month ending showing. So this is all of the subcontractors billings to us. So if you go here to the invoicing, it's got approved. This is like payable invoices. That's our subcontractor pay apps. The total approves 251, 690, 140. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
So that number should be the number that is on the psr. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Yes. So right here should equal that. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Okay. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Job cost to date is. No, that's not accurate. Because job planner, like the number that you can. You'll be checking for me is in the budget. This number here. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Oh, okay. It won't be on the last sheet you just showed me. It won't be the receivable pay apps. It will be the budget. This is project budget, grand total at the bottom. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Actual amount. Yeah, that bottom total. Because that includes all of our internal GC costs, labor dumpsters, all of that stuff. Project manager, super, all these things. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Okay. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
And then it total totals up that with the sub billings that I haven't got to figure out if they. They're showing the previous month or this month. I'm not sure why. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
But why is it like such a grand difference then? 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Well, I think because this should reflect the payments we've already made to our subcontractors. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Oh, okay. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Because like we should. Because you're trying to figure out, if you look at these numbers, like job to date cost is everything we paid out. And you take that what we paid out and you know that like, hey, the previous month's billing has covered everything. Because like when they build 360, if this price over here, like if this job planner cost today is more than 360, then you got a problem. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Oh, I understand. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
It should never be above that because like we're supposed to get paid, you know, everything's kind of like a month behind on getting paid. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Makes sense. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Like this was like job today cost. We had 44,000 here. Well, we only built 31,000 in May. So by the time we get paid at the end of July, you know, even if we get that payment, we've spent $12,000 more than we collected. Does that make sense? 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Yeah, it's totally making sense because this is. We're looking at May and July. You're pretty much informing me that the payments get. They fall like a month behind. But that's normal because. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Yeah. So like when we submit a billing at the end of this month, it gets paid the end of this month. So whatever's in this box by the end of this month has to be covered. But whatever was billed in this month. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Oh, okay, okay, Now I get it. Okay. So that number will always be greater than the total month ending because it needs to be enough to cover the cost. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Right. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Okay, got it, got it. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
So. Well, things happen. Sometimes costs get in there that we didn't anticipate. There's not much you can do that but make up for it the next month. But you just don't want every single job being that way. Or we're. We're. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Yeah, or else. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Loading all of this cost throughout the job. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Wait, what was that last part? You would drop the job. Drop the job. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
We're. We're floating, I call it. Which means we're paying, we should get ahead and we're not cash negative on jobs. So. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Right. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
You just always need to over bill. So he took care of that this next month. Like in July, he billed 360 per job planner. At the end of August, we've really only spent 142. So that means we're 200,000 positive. So that's a good thing as long as we get paid. But in this case we also haven't been paid, so. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Right. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
But they're FedExing a check, I guess today to us, so that's good. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Oh, okay. Okay. I think I heard about this amount then earlier today. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Yeah, so what I'm saying, like when you're looking for the numbers, you're looking for the job to date cost, you're looking at the total sub billing, which we went to, where you find those two. And then you'll just verify the owner's billing, which is in this invoicing tab. Receivable invoices is the invoice that we send to the owner. And you just look up here. Here's the amount. 464-05-9973. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Perfect. Okay, sounds great. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
So that's where. When I look at, you know, this Excel file that you have. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
There'S four. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Which I'll stop sharing, and you can share. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Which one is. There we go. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
So even if, like, you add this. You can add this to the bottom of, you know, the bottom of this worksheet where you're just. You're checking on, like, under balance. If you put current fee. Like, you can just type these in. Go over to the far left. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Wait, what do you. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
All the way to the left, period. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Okay. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Go down below balance. Go below balance. See the last line? There you go. Now just start writing these in. Put original fee, and then you put original insurance. Or I'm sorry, not original. These are current. That's all I'm tracking is current. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Okay. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
And then current fee. Change the original to current. Like line 21. Line 21. There you go. All right. Then you go current contingency. Okay. So you got current fee in there twice. So go up to that. After current insurance, next one should be current contingency. Okay. And then current profit. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
And you have this all memorized in your head. Are you reading it from somewhere? 

**Jesse Dawson:**
No, I'm reading it off of what we. Just that same PSR we were looking at. I'm just telling you which boxes. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Okay. I thought you were just. You had it all memorized. I wouldn't be surprised if it's all in your head. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
And then sub billing total. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Okay. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
And then job to date costs, and then we already have the owner billing up top. But if it's easier for you to just fill all these in, you can do so. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Okay. Wait, go on. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Yeah. I mean, the current owner building, you already got it in the line up there, so that's fine. So. So if you. You can look back through the video, see where we found these things, right. From Job Planner. And then you just. If you just fill those in for each of the projects, then I can just. All I gotta do is open this worksheet, open up their PSR, and compare it. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Oh, okay. Sounds good. That now I understand how, like, this is all, like, beneficial to you. Because I thought I was like. Because I knew. Now I know, like, what you do with all the numbers and all this information. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Yeah. Just me having to go through each job and open all those things up and. And see what it is, then. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Yeah. Okay. So with every job, like, you know how I added and double checked that all of the jobs had the owner billing column and all of the numbers were accurate. So now with every job, you want me to double check the fact that what is on their psr. And obviously you don't have to even. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Look at the psr. All you got to do is find your information from job planner. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Perfect. Okay. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
And I guess put on there on below job today cost add one for open for owner change orders. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Oh, okay. Open for owner change order. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
You put open PCCOs and then open change requests. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Did I just put CR or change request is fine. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
CR is fine. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Okay. PCCO is something. Some change request. What was it again? It was the project. Okay. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
So. And then we'll eventually get into it. You know, open RFIs, open submittals, which we can look at that later, but. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Okay. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Okay. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Yeah, I'm just taking notes. Awesome. Okay, sounds good, Dusty. I'll go ahead and work on this for a while. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
There you go. Yeah, once you get. That's how you. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Yeah. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Get the. No Job planner. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Yeah, I think once I. I'm already familiar and pretty comfortable with it, but I feel like once I go ahead and. Wait, let me go ahead and Once I go ahead and, like, do at least like two or three projects, I think I'll get the hang of it. And then I'll just go by fast. It's just the amount of like, Let me do 1, 2. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
It's the same thing over and over. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Yeah, but just check in. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Just checking it is good. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Okay, Sounds good. Yeah. After probably a few projects, I'll go ahead and ask for like, your review to make sure I'm doing everything accurate. And then I'll just. And then I think the rest will go by really fast. Thank you, Jesse. Thank you so much. All right, bye.
