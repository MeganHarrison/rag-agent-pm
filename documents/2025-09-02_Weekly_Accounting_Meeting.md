Hey, Jesse, how are you? 

**Jose Mendez:**
Hi, Jason. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Say, I need to pull some invoices where we paid for permit things on Roebling Homes so I can bill them today. Did Nick send a billing for Roebling Homes? 

**Maria Calcetero:**

**Fatima Njie:**
Okay. What is the job number? 

**Jesse Dawson:**
It's 25, 121. 

**Fatima Njie:**
25, 121. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Show anything? We've already been paid by them. I thought. 

**Fatima Njie:**
This will be the owner villain, right? 

**Jose Mendez:**
Yeah. What the hell? 

**Fatima Njie:**
Two of them in Japan. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Why is. How can that. 

**Fatima Njie:**
For August, he build 21,100 on one of them. But I remember I saw two, so let me check out. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Yeah, there's. There's two billings on the job. The one on my men. Now I need to find out why we got two. 

**Fatima Njie:**
Okay, well, there are two. Two jobs. Let me share my screen. One of them has nothing. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Okay. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
So I'm going to delete that one. 

**Fatima Njie:**
Okay. And the second one has. It has two receivable invoices. One for July, one for August. Hello. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
So there's receivables charged to one and then. Or one of them has nothing at all in it. 

**Fatima Njie:**
Yes. 

**Jose Mendez:**
Okay. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
That's the one I need to delete. 

**Fatima Njie:**
That's the one you deleted. Okay. Yeah. The second one I'm looking at has two. Two receivable invoices. One for $14,900, the other one for 15,400. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Because I just need to find the invoices, anything we paid for permits on that and get that submitted today. 

**Fatima Njie:**
Okay. Again, I'll look in acumen. We could look at acumen for that. 25, 121. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Are you guys already in what part of. For this. For. 

**Fatima Njie:**
Oh, no, we were talking about something different. He had. He had another question about a job in philanthropy. So. Yeah, you can go ahead and start from the top. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Yeah, no, it's okay. You can start. So current budget is status outstanding invoices and receivables. All good on the part. 

**Fatima Njie:**
Yes, I realize that looks like Fritzi is not available. So I sent you the AP and AR agent. I just. I emailed it to you not too long ago. But the outstanding invoice is unreceivable. We can't hear You. You're muted. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Who's muted? 

**Fatima Njie:**
Okay. Yeah. Maria, I sent you the AP&AR agent. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Yes, I'm seeing. 

**Fatima Njie:**
I want to pull those up and share it. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Oh, so let me go ahead once again. So let me share the screen. One second. Yeah, we're looking at those. So this is number one, correct? 

**Fatima Njie:**
Yes, that's the AR agent. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Wait, but let me download this, because if we don't download and they won't loop. Good region save AP agent. So wait for the OMG to open. It doesn't matter. 

**Fatima Njie:**
It doesn't matter. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Okay, so AP aging to Jesse and Brandon. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Go to the bottom. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
All the way to the bottom. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yep. Here. Okay, I'm confused here. How this says 4 million. My. When I go into notion and I look at my cash flow analysis, it says 7.4. 

**Fatima Njie:**
I think the cash flow analysis is that the one she updated last week on Friday. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah. And I know we didn't get paid $3 million. 

**Fatima Njie:**
See. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Our AR is 7.8 million. Whatever this is is wrong. This is AP United Excavating United Rentals. This is not AR aging. This is the AP aging. This is the wrong spreadsheet. 

**Fatima Njie:**
Yeah, this is the ap. AP agent. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Yes. 

**Fatima Njie:**
Maria, can you open the AR agent? 

**Maria Calcetero:**
So, okay, so. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Now let's go to the bottom. 

**Fatima Njie:**
Yep. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
One sec. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Okay. All right. So nothing's really changed. We got 400,000 added, which. But we haven't been paid. Okay. All right. 

**Fatima Njie:**
As far as AR goes, do you want us to chase anything or is that on the PM side, or do you want us to start stepping in. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
I mean, the things that we are owed, you know, I mean, or you know, from a few clients. Now, as far as Aspire and stuff goes, you know, keep. Can keep hitting up their, you know, Aspires Accounting, you know, Neiman sent us a check, you know, via FedEx. So it should be here, I think, by Wednesday, tomorrow then. Those are really the only ones that are I'm worried about. I mean, you know, I'm talking with ibeach. I mean, you know, they're not going to pay us till next week, it looks like. And it's not even going to be the full mount. And then radio should pay us this week, they said. But, I mean, they're, you know, a few days late. They're not months. So one thing I'd like for you to see is I'd like to see a responsibility matrix created showing, you know, what are all the, you know, tasks for accounting, you know, so it's like, you know, who is doing the credit Card entries, you know, or it's like, all right, you know, we're processing the, you know, owner pay at like all those things that whatever all those tasks are, who's doing them, you know, so it's like here's everything that we got and here's who responsible, either Fritzi or Jose. Right. So that we could see all that and so know who's doing what. 

**Jose Mendez:**
Okay, for credit card, we downloaded all the Transaction as of August 31st today to be coded in notion. But it's. Yeah, the last August transaction that we have pending for coding. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Okay, so what? So go back to the. You can get out of this. Maria, go back to the main sheet. So what is the current last up to date entered for credit card transactions? 

**Jose Mendez:**
July, but we have some approved. Approved transaction that we can. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
July what? 

**Jose Mendez:**
Let me see. We have a few. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
So what I'm looking for, and this is what I brought up on the last call is we should have a note in here, right, that says all, you know, credit card transactions have been coded and synced with Acumatica through July 1, July 8, whatever that date is. Like boom. We are, you know, everything through this date is complete and put into acumatica. 

**Jose Mendez:**
Okay. Yeah, but I can tell you that all the Transaction as of July 31 is closed and uploaded into akumatica yet. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Okay. So as of the end, July 31, everything is synced and incorrect. 

**Jose Mendez:**
Yes. And we are working on August transaction. But it's working. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah. All right. And then as far as everything accounts payable wise, what is that through for. 

**Fatima Njie:**
Accounts payable? So as of July, everything accounting related is done. That's why we were able to send you the financials. So right now August just ended. Jose is working on making sure all the credit cards are coded and entered and also accounts payable, all the subcontract billings are being entered and synced. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Right. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Okay, what's next is payroll and compliance updates, Jose. 

**Jose Mendez:**
Yeah, well, working on August and for credit card. Yeah, but this should be completed next week because I need to review that. All the coding should be completed this week. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Okay. And timesheets are synced through what date. 

**Jose Mendez:**
Timesheets as of July because we have the payroll for pay date August 15th. We have submitted last week on Friday to Jesse for his review. But that is for pay date August 15th and we are working on a pay date August 29th, but still working, just being. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Okay, so payday August 1st, that is all entered and synced into acumatica. 

**Jose Mendez:**
Yes, and sync it. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
All right. And then for payday, the 15th you. You're just waiting on Jesse to approve something. 

**Jose Mendez:**
Yeah, but we just submitted on Friday. Yes, but yes, that's okay. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
And, and then that can be synced. 

**Jose Mendez:**
Yeah. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Did you say. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Do you send that to me Friday? 

**Jose Mendez:**
Yes. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Okay. Yeah. Okay. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Okay. On the payroll side from my end. So everything is good. We're already. Ian is going to receive more payments since the last week, but that's done. Ashley is already included on that one. So that's good. Everything is running smoothly on the payroll side with the. With Ventures. So that's okay. Akumatica guys, pending transactions issues or delays. Jose, you mentioned you have a tracking on Notion. 

**Jose Mendez:**
Yeah, but tracking on Notion. We have one in progress for. Let me see, let me see. For Google Bloomington but is fixed on our end by the waiting for Kristen and her team. It. Her team? Yeah, IT department for deleting the zero outlines. But just waiting. It should be completed today. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Okay. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Okay. And then you mentioned credit card transactions in Notion. That's good. Calendar. Is everything updated in the calendar from Notion? 

**Jose Mendez:**
Yes. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Okay. Timesheets also you just talked about it. Any other check ins that you guys need from Brandon or Jesse, Any other documents, insurance, everything. I saw that you will be the payment Fatima for the wc. 

**Fatima Njie:**
Yes, the payment was made. But Brandon, I wanted to confirm the policy period because I noticed that the invoice said September 23, September 2023 to September 2024. Is that correct? I confirmed. I sent an email to Sarah and she said that was correct. But I just wanted to confirm with you if that is correct. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
I don't know, you might want to send an email to Corey and Lisa and ask them. But I mean I don't understand why we're paying for last year. 

**Fatima Njie:**
Yeah, that's what it said. 2023 to 2024. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
That's. 

**Fatima Njie:**
She said. Yes, it's correct. And then when I kept asking then she said okay, you might want to check with the policy people. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah, I would say like reach out to, you know, include Corey and Lisa on that and let's ask in that question. 

**Fatima Njie:**
Okay. Yeah, but it is paid so they won't be canceling anything. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Okay. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Jose, something that you need from Brandon or Jesse to check in any documents, signature, something that you guys need? 

**Jose Mendez:**
Oh no, only that we just submitted by email the tax information that was requested through teams today. Yeah. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Okay. And then again, you know, for this meeting next week, I want to see instead of sending a bunch of different emails, you know, to Jesse and I like, I want to see one package. It's like all right. Here's all this stuff. And that agenda should not be the same every week. It should be like, okay, you know, just what I. The questions that I asked. Like, all right, we are synced through these dates for these pay items. You know, here's what we're on. Receivables, right? Like, all these. This information should be filled out and done ahead of time and on that sheet so that we can read it and not sit there and ask these questions and go through it, you know, because we have no time to download it or ask anything. 

**Jose Mendez:**
Okay? 

**Brandon Clymer:**
So come next Monday, I expect to see that in my and Jesse's email box. 

**Jose Mendez:**
Okay. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
All right. 

**Fatima Njie:**
Yep. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Sounds good. We'll just create, probably, like, I'm thinking, so we. Guys can. We can edit everything on the document or we can do it on the chat, guys. Okay, I'll come up with something. 

**Fatima Njie:**
Maybe on Mondays, Maria, have a separate meeting with accounting where we can all discuss all these items and have the agenda reviewed, and then you can send that out in preparation for Tuesday. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
So what we can do is, instead of the accounting team, but Jesse and Brandon, we have the other one, the separate one. So we can just send everything there. And then I just can ask you guys, hey, let's fill out everything, you know, from the agenda, edit agenda, and then send it on Monday and the new agenda, also send it before the meeting. Sounds good. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Again, all these documents and everything should all be one file. I don't want to open up nine different files. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
No, it has to be like, a zip folder or something. 

**Fatima Njie:**
Yeah. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
All right. See you. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Okay. Makes sense. Thank you, guys. 

**Jose Mendez:**
Thank you. Yeah.
