**Bclymer**: Yeah, we submitted what we need to submit.
**Bclymer**: Now we're just waiting on the city.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay, Bloomington.
**Njepson**: And on that nick, can you call up the fence guy, make sure and then see if he's somehow we got to get him to order his fence because it's going to take him six to eight weeks to get his fence but push it out even further.
**Njepson**: So.
**Njepson**: Or call and ask him like just tell them we're not changing anything.
**Njepson**: Like see if we can get that thing ordered.
**Bclymer**: And that fence contractor is hired by Goodwill, right?
**Njepson**: Yeah, but we talk to him all the time.
**Njepson**: He's should have his contact info.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay.
**Mcalcetero**: Goodwill, Bloomington.
**Njepson**: That we're just.
**Njepson**: That's where I've been all day long.
**Njepson**: So go ahead.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, that's permitting where we have most.
**Bclymer**: The most of the buyout at this point.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay.
**Mcalcetero**: So nothing from an item on.
**Njepson**: Do you have an item on there open for the permit issues?
**Njepson**: Getting those resolved.
**Njepson**: Each of the ones they asked us to do.
**Bclymer**: You can make one responding to permit comments.
**Njepson**: Four specific.
**Njepson**: There's four like four specific things I think on their nick that they wanted us to do that was changing our scope of work.
**Njepson**: I would just.
**Njepson**: Again, it's just to track all these things we got to keep a track on.
**Njepson**: Like and you really should be the one that going in there and you add those things like hermit.
**Njepson**: Main comments.
**Njepson**: Tried to call Brian with Kimberly Horn today and did.
**Njepson**: He didn't answer.
**Njepson**: I sent him a message but I just want to see what he thinks because we couldn't get in that bolt to see what size it is because they're.
**Njepson**: They're very specific on it that we got to put in os&y valves and if they don't fit then we got to replace the whole thing.
**Njepson**: So it ended up costing some money.
**Njepson**: And then we looked at the water.
**Njepson**: That other comment was about the, you know, the water service work comes in and something we didn't address.
**Njepson**: You can't even tell where it is now, but it looks like it comes up like 8 foot away from the wall.
**Njepson**: It comes up where the existing mop sink is.
**Njepson**: Now we're gonna have to.
**Njepson**: That's another thing we'd have to revise on the drawings is rerouting that under the slab so it's not coming up in the middle of the room back there.
**Njepson**: Those are the two big things they.
**Njepson**: They got on there.
**Njepson**: Another one was for the fire sprinkler riser not shown here.
**Mcalcetero**: Fire sprinkler hide is still not started.
**Mcalcetero**: So should we change that in progress or.
**Mcalcetero**: Still waiting on that one.
**Mcalcetero**: Nick.
**Mcalcetero**: On the fire sprinkler.
**Bclymer**: I think they wanted us to show the sprinkler riser, which is a separate item.
**Mcalcetero**: Where.
**Mcalcetero**: So do you want me to add it as a task or.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, as a task.
**Mcalcetero**: So what is the task again?

**Ataylor**: I mean, let's see where you are.
**Ataylor**: So starting at the top.
**Ataylor**: Kitchen, that's for me.
**Ataylor**: Reviews, I need cnc Redline contract and some testing bids I need to review with Jesse tomorrow or Wednesday when he has some time.
**Ataylor**: Currently working on getting some stair rail pricing.
**Ataylor**: I've gotten a little bit of headway on that so far.
**Ataylor**: Come on, why don't you scroll?
**Ataylor**: Stay Rail pricing.
**Ataylor**: I got one estimate back so far and with some options.
**Ataylor**: I'm waiting.
**Ataylor**: I still have two or three more people I'm waiting on.
**Ataylor**: Bids on gas turned off.
**Njepson**: That's.
**Ataylor**: I'm dealing.
**Ataylor**: I'm waiting on.
**Ataylor**: We gotta wait for the permit, but that's just a note for Ashton to make sure we get that addressed.
**Ataylor**: With the gas company working on getting one more bid for our traffic control stuff.
**Ataylor**: The existing well is going to be terminated on Monday.
**Ataylor**: Construction fencing will start either maybe next Friday or the following Monday after a groundbreaking ceremony, depending on what day we actually get started.
**Ataylor**: Ryan needs about at least three days to get the site cleared enough for us to come and put our construction fence up.
**Ataylor**: Site trailers being delivered next Thursday.
**Njepson**: What is the what is the contingent on us starting?
**Njepson**: Like, what is that at this point?
**Ataylor**: Yeah, gosh.
**Ataylor**: Basically Ashton sent back all of the comments and then got confirmation today that everything was resolved.
**Ataylor**: And so all we're waiting on is John Rankin from the City to confirm.
**Ataylor**: Yes, go ahead and send the stamp set.
**Ataylor**: Ashton, send the stamp set, they will stamp it and then I need to get the stamp set printed and brought over to the Westfield office for our Inspector Carlton.
**Ataylor**: And then the owners need to finish their bond.
**Ataylor**: So those are the last two things I'm waiting on.
**Ataylor**: Is John to answer the question?
**Ataylor**: Yes, we're good.
**Ataylor**: Which Michael Pierce already confirmed that we're good.
**Ataylor**: So he has to issue it to Ashton Stamp, get it to Westfield Stamp, and then owners need the bond.
**Ataylor**: Once the stamp set and the bond is done, then we can get our pre con scheduled.
**Ataylor**: So I've talked with Katie twice today.
**Ataylor**: They're working through the bond stuff and we have been trying to get a hold of John Rankin from the City relentlessly and can't get a hold of him today.
**Ataylor**: I've sent him an email, called him twice, Ashton replied, sent him everything from Michael Pierce and that.
**Ataylor**: I mean, that guy just screwed stuff up and burned us for another two days.
**Ataylor**: Right now is.
**Ataylor**: Is what's happening, actually, another three days because it's almost 4:00 and he still hasn't answered.
**Ataylor**: It's really frustrating.
**Njepson**: But he's.
**Njepson**: His answering it will get us released.
**Ataylor**: His.
**Ataylor**: His answer is, is.
**Ataylor**: Let me get back into it.
**Ataylor**: Permits.
**Ataylor**: The review was returned yesterday.
**Ataylor**: I let him know.
**Ataylor**: Hey, John, Ashton replied to the correspondence and showed you the comments that were already addressed by Michael Pierce.
**Ataylor**: Is there anything else you need from us?
**Ataylor**: He hasn't responded to me and he hasn't responded to Ashton.
**Ataylor**: Ashton's supposed to send me the updated plan set or keep me in the loop as soon as he does, because they.
**Ataylor**: They contact him through the portal, the Westfield portal.
**Ataylor**: So they don't.
**Ataylor**: They don't email us back.
**Ataylor**: It goes to the submitter.
**Ataylor**: So I asked him for a time frame now that he's got everything and he's not.
**Ataylor**: He hasn't answered since Friday.
**Ataylor**: Okay, so we don't need to get a tent permit though.
**Ataylor**: But we are.
**Ataylor**: I mean, I'm pushing, man.
**Ataylor**: There's nothing.
**Ataylor**: I can't get a hold of the guy, I can't get him to.
**Ataylor**: All he has to do is say, yes, I was wrong.
**Ataylor**: Go ahead and send me the stamp set.
**Ataylor**: Oh, here it is.
**Ataylor**: So is the light at the entrance, which was already addressed for the photometric plan.
**Ataylor**: They sent back comments.
**Ataylor**: Ashton replied.
**Ataylor**: John and Michael.
**Ataylor**: See the response below.
**Ataylor**: We already just decided this.
**Ataylor**: It's not a private driver, residential, blah blah.
**Ataylor**: The plat is not holding up the permit.
**Ataylor**: He issued the permit.
**Ataylor**: Essentially the platting is coming later.
**Ataylor**: Michael Pierce confirmed per my previous comments, no light's going to be required.
**Ataylor**: Let's reduce the easement.
**Ataylor**: And Ashton said thank you.
**Ataylor**: Here is a comment that was addressed.
**Ataylor**: Platting will need to be after the fact.
**Ataylor**: John, I owe you a stamped plans.
**Ataylor**: So you can place the public work stamp on them.
**Ataylor**: Correct.
**Ataylor**: And he's waiting for John to give him the go ahead.
**Ataylor**: That was at 10am this morning.
**Ataylor**: So I guess I called him twice.
**Ataylor**: I've emailed him to follow up.
**Ataylor**: Ashton's emailed him.
**Ataylor**: I spoke with Carlton earlier.
**Ataylor**: Our.
**Ataylor**: Our inspector.

**Ataylor**: And then on vendor space C, we shifted the door to the south.
**Ataylor**: The south part of that little vendor space so it's not right next to that column so that they can get equipment in and out of there more easily.
**Ataylor**: Other than that, I think you have already seen the other changes.
**Ataylor**: So take a look at this and shoot me an email back and just confirm that this is good to go.
**Ataylor**: Thank you.
**Mcalcetero**: Sa it.
**Ataylor**: Did you call over with?
**Ataylor**: All right.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: Your.
**Ataylor**: Your operations meeting.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, I thought it started like at 4.
**Ataylor**: Sorry, 3:30 that noon.
**Ataylor**: No, because wasn't it like an hour and a half the last time or something?
**Ataylor**: First time it was over two hours.
**Ataylor**: But it's not supposed to be like that.
**Ataylor**: We just go through every.
**Ataylor**: Every job on notion.
**Ataylor**: That's all we do.
**Ataylor**: So make sure everything's updated.
**Ataylor**: Brandon even want it?
**Ataylor**: No.
**Ataylor**: Who was you?
**Ataylor**: Nick, the ops team and just me.
**Ataylor**: Nick, Maria, Jesse and Brandon.
**Ataylor**: A.J.
**Ataylor**: no.
**Ataylor**: No A.J.
**Ataylor**: no Brandon.
**Ataylor**: So yeah, I guess there's just Nick and I them.
**Ataylor**: What is this?
**Ataylor**: So what Seal concrete.
**Ataylor**: I have basic design.
**Ataylor**: I dropped off the section.
**Ataylor**: The sample is black.
**Ataylor**: The sample card with the colors has the matte black.
**Ataylor**: What are you talking about?
**Ataylor**: Not sure.
**Ataylor**: Door guy.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, but why is he.
**Ataylor**: What is he.
**Ataylor**: Why is he responding to this?
**Ataylor**: I am.
**Ataylor**: That I don't know.
**Ataylor**: Oh, I thought the wind is wicked out there, dude.
**Ataylor**: See you in the morning.
**Ataylor**: No, where are you going?
**Ataylor**: They're not going to be there till 9.
**Ataylor**: Is being forwarded to make run and get the sign tomorrow morning 9 to 10.
**Ataylor**: Might as well wait till you get the prints.
**Ataylor**: You can.
**Ataylor**: We can print them out.
**Ataylor**: Really?
**Ataylor**: Anywhere.
**Ataylor**: Where is Repro Graphics around here?
**Ataylor**: Right?
**Ataylor**: Well, the one I've got to go to is down by Gillette's or Summit's office.
**Ataylor**: Summer or Gillette.
**Ataylor**: Gillette, that's right.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: It's on that.
**Ataylor**: Oh, there's Jesse.
**Ataylor**: It's on that.
**Ataylor**: The.
**Ataylor**: That weird name of that street.
**Ataylor**: Is it the actual show up?
**Ataylor**: I guess not.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, it is.
**Ataylor**: So do we have the final civil Rolling jet.
**Ataylor**: No.
**Ataylor**: What's he gotta adjust now?
**Ataylor**: Nothing.
**Ataylor**: It's that idiot John that this all up.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, but I mean, so we do have the final ones that will be the approved ones, right?
**Ataylor**: I mean, they will, but they still need to be stamped.
**Ataylor**: They need to be stamped by the city and then I can.
**Ataylor**: He hasn't stamped them yet, Ashton.
**Ataylor**: No, he hasn't stamped him because John hasn't responded to him.
**Ataylor**: Even though I don't know what he's waiting on because we have an email from Michael Peters saying it's good to go.
**Ataylor**: Thank you, Michael.
**Ataylor**: As.
**Ataylor**: Let's see.
**Ataylor**: John, I believe I owe you a stamp plan.
**Ataylor**: So you can place the WPWD stamp on them.
**Ataylor**: Correct.
**Ataylor**: No answer.
**Ataylor**: Just.
**Ataylor**: Ashton, just send it, man.
**Ataylor**: Like.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, I can't.
**Ataylor**: I can't do anything more.
**Ataylor**: Like everybody knows that we're trying to push this through and it's like nobody's.
**Ataylor**: Nobody's following up on anything.
**Ataylor**: See?
**Ataylor**: From old Castle Big and mash code.
**Ataylor**: Please call with any questions.
**Ataylor**: Katie's at the front door.
**Ataylor**: Hey.
**Ataylor**: Holy.
**Ataylor**: 109 gram.
**Ataylor**: 5,500 square feet of 4 inch CMU veneer from consumers.
**Ataylor**: Approximately 5,000 blocks for building and dumpster.
**Ataylor**: 12 inch regular block for dumpster.
**Ataylor**: I told you no 80s.
**Ataylor**: An 8 inch walls of corn stream.
**Ataylor**: It's flashing.
**Ataylor**: Okay, I don't.
**Ataylor**: This is not what I asked for.
**Ataylor**: Hades.
**Ataylor**: Come here.
**Ataylor**: Dude.
**Ataylor**: That's the problem with the undesigned build that.
**Ataylor**: Well, I gave him all the information and he comes back at 5500 square feet.
**Ataylor**: Our estimate was only accounting for like 2500 square feet.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, 2500 square feet.
**Ataylor**: But it also had faux stone.
**Ataylor**: But then that is zero figured 12 inch regular block for the dumpster foundation and 8 inch for the walls with 4 inch veneer on exterior.
**Ataylor**: I told you that it's all 8 inch block.
**Ataylor**: Really?
**Ataylor**: That's it.
**Ataylor**: Are they filling it?
**Ataylor**: What's it?
**Ataylor**: Huh?
**Ataylor**: What's it.
**Ataylor**: What does that mean?
**Ataylor**: What are you saying?
**Ataylor**: Are they actually filling the blocks?
**Ataylor**: Grounding them solid?
**Ataylor**: I think so.
**Ataylor**: Just call for it.
**Ataylor**: Split face.
**Ataylor**: 12 inch by 8 inch grout.
**Ataylor**: Solid.
**Ataylor**: 12 inch by 8 inch by 16 inch.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, but we're not.
**Ataylor**: We're just doing the 8 inch block.
**Ataylor**: You're just doing 8 by 8 by 16.
**Ataylor**: Yes, 8 inch, not 8 foot.
**Mcalcetero**: SA.
**Ataylor**: Consumers Country Blend.
**Ataylor**: Country blend is the color he's asking.
**Ataylor**: Figure 5,500 square feet of 4 inch CMU veneer from consumers figured 12 inch regular block for the dumpster foundation.
**Ataylor**: So that means basically Bringing up out of the ground, let's say 12 inch block here.
**Ataylor**: And then when he gets to this course here, they'd go to 8 inch.
**Ataylor**: Why?
**Ataylor**: Well, because then you're getting a 4 inch veneer on the outside.
**Ataylor**: Literally.
**Ataylor**: Whoever wanted what.
**Ataylor**: We're not doing a veneer.
**Ataylor**: Whoever put the quote together did not know what the hell they were doing.
**Ataylor**: But where does the veneer come from?
**Ataylor**: Does none of this says veneer?
**Ataylor**: Nope.
**Ataylor**: What's that note?
**Ataylor**: City approved dumpster gate.
**Ataylor**: That's nothing.
**Ataylor**: So I'll join it.
**Ataylor**: Bond beam.
**Ataylor**: We do have to do bonding, sir.
**Ataylor**: We.
**Ataylor**: The whole thing doesn't get grab solid.
**Ataylor**: It's just.
**Ataylor**: It's just the reinforced cells, right?
**Ataylor**: Not normally.
**Ataylor**: Well, normally you should have reinforcement every.
**Ataylor**: You do reinforcement every four feet?
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: Horizontal.
**Ataylor**: That's a 16 inch on the center.
**Ataylor**: Where's our interior?
**Ataylor**: Where's our.
**Ataylor**: And then you'll have a bond beam about six foot.
**Ataylor**: And then at the top.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: The vertical only would go up every four feet.
**Ataylor**: You don't fill every.
**Ataylor**: Every cell you fill.
**Ataylor**: When you have vertical rebar, you fill those cells with.
**Ataylor**: That's what the rebar is for.
**Ataylor**: Split face CMU bond beam.
**Ataylor**: Two number fours, continuous grout.
**Ataylor**: Solid, solid at 40.
**Ataylor**: There it is at 48 on center.
**Ataylor**: So you grab it here, here, here, here.
**Ataylor**: No, that's saying these are 48 inch on center.
**Ataylor**: Right?
**Ataylor**: This is.
**Ataylor**: Well, so this is four foot up.
**Ataylor**: That's eight foot up.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, but the 48 on center is.
**Ataylor**: Is going this way.
**Ataylor**: You put one here, four feet over, and those are sticking it up.
**Ataylor**: What do you.
**Ataylor**: What's.
**Ataylor**: What are you calling 4ft on center then where else is there 4ft?
**Ataylor**: You can't go this way.
**Ataylor**: Can't go up and down.
**Ataylor**: We have a horizontal.
**Ataylor**: That's talking about your bond.
**Ataylor**: You're seeing bond beam bonding real solid at 48 inches on center.
**Ataylor**: That's for horizontal reinforcement.
**Ataylor**: What's at 48 on center then?
**Ataylor**: This is.
**Ataylor**: And then that is.
**Ataylor**: Oh, up here.
**Ataylor**: Height.
**Ataylor**: Yes.
**Ataylor**: Basically you'll have a bond.
**Ataylor**: Where's our vertical reinforcement then?
**Ataylor**: Well, they.
**Ataylor**: They put horizontal joint reinforcement at 16, but I think I should say vertical.
**Ataylor**: Well, that's every reinforcement.
**Ataylor**: That's every course.
**Ataylor**: That's this.
**Ataylor**: That ladder, that little mesh like welded wire fabric.
**Ataylor**: The ladder they put on top of every course.
**Ataylor**: That's what that is.
**Ataylor**: Zoom out.
**Ataylor**: Nope, it doesn't say there.
**Ataylor**: Your vertical reinforcement is going to match whatever your foundation reinforcement is, which is four feet on the center.
**Ataylor**: So there's always be every four feet coming Up.
**Ataylor**: Why isn't it.
**Ataylor**: Why doesn't it call this out?
**Ataylor**: Because normally you go to a schedule and that's where it gives it to you.
**Ataylor**: Nothing calls out anything on this plan set because nothing is scheduled.
**Ataylor**: So if you go to your str, it should be on your structural morning.
**Ataylor**: You want to fight?
**Ataylor**: That dog does not like little kids.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, little kids go walk in my front door.
**Ataylor**: I thought that dog was going out.
**Ataylor**: It doesn't say here either.
**Ataylor**: Chad.
**Ataylor**: What the man, Jesse.
**Ataylor**: When we do.
**Ataylor**: Here it is.
**Ataylor**: This is it right here.
**Ataylor**: Typical reinforcing at the walls.
**Ataylor**: Vertical reinforcement per CMU schedule.
**Ataylor**: It still doesn't call out the distances.
**Ataylor**: But these are typically every 48 inches, right Jesse?
**Ataylor**: Depends on where vertical looking.
**Ataylor**: Because of this doesn't call out any vertical reinforcement.
**Ataylor**: Well, it shows if it doesn't call every 40 inch.
**Ataylor**: What are all the notes should tell you?
**Njepson**: Go to the cmu.
**Ataylor**: Go see me.
**Njepson**: What the.
**Njepson**: The spec sheet from the structural drawings.
**Njepson**: It'll tell you unless noted otherwise.
**Njepson**: Minimum four foot spacing or something like.
**Ataylor**: There'S your vertical bars where for openings that interrupt two or more regular space.
**Ataylor**: Vertical bars provide additional two.
**Ataylor**: So that's like if you've got a door eight inches off the door, that first cell.
**Ataylor**: You add an extra bar there.
**Ataylor**: We're looking for this distance between all.
**Njepson**: So go to the spec sheet on the structural drawings.
**Ataylor**: Masonry.
**Njepson**: There max and vertical reinforcing shall be at number five.
**Njepson**: At 48 inch on center.
**Ataylor**: Full height unless noted otherwise.
**Ataylor**: Wall vertical over 5.
**Ataylor**: 48.
**Ataylor**: There you go.
**Ataylor**: There it is.
**Ataylor**: 48 inches.
**Ataylor**: There it is.
**Ataylor**: All right.
**Ataylor**: No, I'm gonna drop off the car.
**Ataylor**: There isn't near all.
**Ataylor**: Pick up the sign tomorrow.
**Ataylor**: I'll go out there.
**Ataylor**: You want me to wait on the sign till we read?
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: I mean you might as well wait and go get it all at once.
**Ataylor**: So.
**Ataylor**: And let's see what else we got going.
**Ataylor**: I need to see if they got the other two sheds moved yet.
**Ataylor**: I'm assuming they're out of there and then.
**Ataylor**: Or they.
**Ataylor**: They were going to disconnect the power that existed that we were going to move for them.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, I think it's already.
**Ataylor**: It's already should already be disconnected.
**Ataylor**: I'm guessing they would have disconnected it when they disconnected the other two.
**Ataylor**: Well, they were supposed to go and pick that one up.
**Ataylor**: Was there.
**Ataylor**: There was power run into the metal shed, right?
**Ataylor**: That we're going to move or.
**Ataylor**: No, no.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: No, there was.
**Ataylor**: I don't think there was power.
**Ataylor**: The one that they sold that somebody was Coming to get Jesse.
**Ataylor**: When you.
**Ataylor**: When you did your takeoff for masonry, did the masonry change a significant amount?
**Ataylor**: Because we had 2500 square feet, and this guy's bidding over 5, 000 square feet.
**Ataylor**: Is that.
**Ataylor**: I'm bidding 5500 square feet.
**Ataylor**: So I'm about to do a takeoff and measure it out, but, I mean, that's not even close.
**Ataylor**: Do you recall when you did the.
**Ataylor**: Has it came up more?
**Ataylor**: Think it's changed since we've been here, dude.
**Ataylor**: Now, since we've been here, I think.
**Njepson**: We had mason wall and we had brick veneer because initially I thought in the front was a masonry veneer instead.
**Ataylor**: Of a split face.
**Ataylor**: That we're doing now.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, yeah.
**Njepson**: You have a budget for masonry veneer.
**Ataylor**: It was just all n.
**Ataylor**: It was just.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, it was pretty much just masonry.
**Ataylor**: 107,000.
**Njepson**: What is this quote?
**Ataylor**: How much is this?
**Ataylor**: This guy is like at 110, but I don't think he's quoting it right.
**Ataylor**: This is the lesson.
**Ataylor**: What was your other quote at 1 for 76 and 1 for 88.
**Ataylor**: There you go.
**Ataylor**: I'd say he's over quoting you.
**Ataylor**: You told me I needed to get more quotes.
**Njepson**: Oh, well, this is perfect.
**Njepson**: Now you know, he's the guy.
**Ataylor**: Now you don't have to get any more quotes.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: All right.
**Ataylor**: We came in for office supplies out there.
**Ataylor**: Our budget was 1500.
**Ataylor**: Right.
**Ataylor**: At 1390.
**Njepson**: Office supplies.
**Njepson**: Well, buying that much paper right off the bat.
**Ataylor**: No, no, just, you know, whiteboard, monitors, things like that.
**Ataylor**: Stuff like that.
**Ataylor**: Chairs, table.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, that was just price and everything.
**Njepson**: Off Amazon budget does mean too.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: During the job.
**Njepson**: But I'm saying use the whole budget up just for the chairs.
**Ataylor**: But I did put in their printer because I both have a printer on site.
**Ataylor**: And it's like.
**Ataylor**: Well, do we just.
**Ataylor**: Sure.
**Ataylor**: So I mean, do we technically take.
**Ataylor**: You know, we buy a printer.
**Ataylor**: We take that out of the furnace budget.
**Ataylor**: Right.
**Ataylor**: That would help us because I250 because I couldn't find one that would do 11 by 17 unless you got in the length of three and something stopping the fast printer scanner didn't mind.
**Ataylor**: Just a printer, you know, that would do a love by set of things.
**Ataylor**: They still made those.
**Ataylor**: When was the last time you sent a packs?
**Ataylor**: 19.
**Ataylor**: What?
**Ataylor**: 94.
**Njepson**: An actual fax machine.
**Ataylor**: All right.
**Njepson**: See you tomorrow.
**Njepson**: Which things did you say you wanted to look at?
**Ataylor**: Oh, the cnc.
**Ataylor**: They owe all of this stuff that we need to review for contract.
**Njepson**: CNC doing what back?
**Ataylor**: Pierce.
**Ataylor**: They.
**Ataylor**: They have a whole legal team that does their contract review and they also need a redacted, redacted copy of the prime contract.
**Ataylor**: And then the.
**Njepson**: Huh, what are they not like.
**Ataylor**: I printed this out so you know, I could just kind of sit down and go over it.
**Ataylor**: Something.
**Njepson**: No, what's it say?
**Njepson**: Well, are you right in the middle of something?
**Ataylor**: I'm in the middle of something.
**Ataylor**: Trying to focus on this right now.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: I gotta go to park and what tomorrow they go first thing in the.
**Njepson**: Morning and I come back.
**Ataylor**: It's not, it's not pressing.
**Ataylor**: I mean they're, they're, they're good, they're working on their submittals.
**Ataylor**: This contract language is just some stuff we need to figure out.
**Ataylor**: And then the, the testing.
**Ataylor**: Honestly, we'll get more information when we do our pre con.
**Ataylor**: What testing they're going to require.
**Ataylor**: Unless you already know, such as proof rolls, concrete testing, compaction testing, all these.
**Ataylor**: So I got a rate sheet and then I got two bids, one for 10,000, one for like 40 some thousand.
**Ataylor**: And so you know, obviously 40,000 were giving us all these tests, so I, I don't think that we're going to need all these.
**Ataylor**: But I also, I don't know if you're going to know until we have that pre con anyways.
**Ataylor**: Right.
**Njepson**: Density test, proof roll test.
**Njepson**: And you get the cubic yards of concrete, they're bigger than a horn.
**Njepson**: And how many pores that'll tell you how many times come out.
**Ataylor**: I mean do they have to test the site?
**Ataylor**: Concrete.
**Njepson**: Herbs, they'll typically take the test curve.
**Ataylor**: So that would be four trips.
**Ataylor**: That would have the foundation slab on deck, slab on grade.
**Njepson**: Well it's not four trips like it's a set of cylinders.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, yeah.
**Njepson**: And then like each day pour, you gotta do it.
**Njepson**: So you talk to your guys.
**Njepson**: How many pours is he gonna make?
**Njepson**: Sounds like you want supporting foundations.
**Ataylor**: Foundation of monolithic slab on deck, one slab on grade one.
**Njepson**: He's gonna like the spread footings.
**Njepson**: I can't believe you pour everything in one day.
**Njepson**: It's just too much to keep open, especially if you're dirt form and stuff.
**Njepson**: So I'm, I would guess they'd have three, maybe four pores foundations.
**Ataylor**: These, that, that would no longer be a monolithic pore then, would it?
**Ataylor**: No, but you got all the spread.
**Njepson**: Footings in the middle and you got the perimeter foundations.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, it's got those foundations through the middle.
**Ataylor**: No, I know, I know what they have.
**Ataylor**: I'm just my question, if, if they don't pour it all at once.
**Ataylor**: Does it Then it's no longer a monolithic foundation, right?
**Njepson**: It is, but you just have to.
**Njepson**: And there's just lapping and there's areas wherever you.
**Njepson**: You know, you put a cold joint in at a certain spot and then for the next day keep going on.
**Njepson**: It's pointing.
**Njepson**: Think when it means monolithic.
**Njepson**: You wanted to pour the.
**Njepson**: What would have been a stem wall with the actual foundation.
**Njepson**: Set up corn on foundation and then come back.
**Njepson**: Do you know how you can change your cursor color?
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: Would you change it to bright green three times greater?
**Ataylor**: Yeah, I used to have mine as green.
**Ataylor**: Green's my favorite.
**Ataylor**: Did we do a standard AIA contract with the for our prime.
**Ataylor**: I know but is that.
**Ataylor**: Is that the AIA contractor is a different.
**Ataylor**: The elevator company is asking is the prime contract a standard aia?
**Ataylor**: Because our subcontract says that they're bound to the prime contract stuff as well.
**Ataylor**: I don't money I don't have to give it to them.
**Ataylor**: They just need to know is it a standard AI Is that the form?
**Ataylor**: Is that the format we use all.
**Njepson**: Subcontracts.
**Ataylor**: They do have to redact pricing and numbers.
**Njepson**: You don't want to see the numbers or anything like special to us.
**Njepson**: But typically standard contract just price.
**Ataylor**: The format that we use is a contract direct.
**Ataylor**: We write it down.
**Njepson**: Well it's not.
**Njepson**: We didn't pay AIA to use their contract.
**Njepson**: But we b.
**Ataylor**: Such.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Njepson**: It's still.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Njepson**: Then Brandon responded at all about that actual.
**Njepson**: Is that copy that's executed by the owner in our Pullman?
**Ataylor**: I believe so.
**Ataylor**: See, it would be under proposal prime contract Westfield Collective from 312 and then revision one.
**Ataylor**: Wait, prime contract.
**Ataylor**: Revision one, Westfield.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: I mean the contract's in here.
**Ataylor**: I don't.
**Ataylor**: I don't know if this is assigned.
**Ataylor**: It's not signed by anybody.
**Ataylor**: Owner pay up PO Reports.
**Ataylor**: Do we put it under our owner folder usually or do we put it under our proposal pos okay.
**Ataylor**: All right.
**Ataylor**: Prime contract from 311.
**Ataylor**: Also not signed.
**Njepson**: Sent you that email.
**Njepson**: The third thing.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Njepson**: And then the invoice you might just did it for you and sent me a copy of it.
**Njepson**: Just means you say that's okay.
**Njepson**: It's the second one.
**Njepson**: I did the 140 last month.
**Njepson**: Wanted to do whatever you want.
**Njepson**: It's obviously they're gone.
**Njepson**: Your girl will split it up.
**Njepson**: I did one.
**Njepson**: Nick did one.
**Njepson**: She does one.
**Njepson**: Just spread it so he has the drawing, he has the loads that the beam was carrying reference that final thing with.
**Njepson**: He said it was about multifamily residential.
**Njepson**: The old people's reservation.
**Ataylor**: It's just.
**Njepson**: It's a multip.
**Njepson**: So that's.
**Njepson**: Although it's not.
**Njepson**: Oh.
**Njepson**: I mean, it's really about the building.
**Ataylor**: Structure.
**Njepson**: So that's always referencing.
**Njepson**: Who gives a shit.
**Ataylor**: If he just.
**Njepson**: Calls it at this facility?
**Ataylor**: That's.
**Njepson**: It does not call out what it.
**Ataylor**: Is.
**Njepson**: At this facility.
**Njepson**: The loans and bones.
**Njepson**: You already said it's fine.
**Njepson**: Just get rid of that.
**Njepson**: Okay, so get that letter.
**Njepson**: We're all fabric.
**Njepson**: And then you guys take it out.
**Njepson**: We'll send it in before.
**Njepson**: Before he takes it out.
**Njepson**: And send my letter to the engineer.
**Njepson**: At this point, it doesn't matter because.
