## Transcript
**Rthompson**: The white utility man, right?
**Rthompson**: Yeah, we got.
**Rthompson**: So we gotta get entrance back up, dude.
**Rthompson**: I don't know if anybody else is going to jump on.
**Rthompson**: So let's just go ahead and get this started so that way you guys can get moving.
**Rthompson**: Ryan, update on water lines.
**Rthompson**: It looks like you're going to be able to do those here in the next two to three weeks.
**Zach**: Good deal.
**Zach**: What are we waiting on at this point?
**Rthompson**: That encroachment permit from Centerpoint Energy Group.
**Zach**: So they're fine with everything now?
**Zach**: They're just writing the permit or.
**Rthompson**: Glenn, go ahead and give an update on that.
**Ikaase**: They went through the engineering and didn't have any comments or issues with it.
**Ikaase**: So now it's going through their approval process, which they said takes up to two weeks, but plan.
**Ikaase**: Plan for three.
**Ikaase**: So that started last week.
**Zach**: Okay.
**Zach**: This week?
**Ikaase**: Yeah, yeah.
**Ikaase**: So yeah.
**Zach**: I think right now I have.
**Zach**: I have it scheduled for Chris to come back in there and do it on the 23rd, I believe is what I had scheduled.
**Rthompson**: Okay.
**Rthompson**: Two weeks plus.
**Rthompson**: Yeah.
**Zach**: So I think that put us right in.
**Zach**: Right in line with what you're saying here.
**Ikaase**: Yeah, I just keep a.
**Ikaase**: I would keep something on the back burner too, just.
**Ikaase**: Just in case they did.
**Ikaase**: They did tell us two weeks, maybe three to be safe.
**Ikaase**: So.
**Zach**: Yeah, I really worked well to get them there that 23rd, but obviously nothing you can do about it.
**Ikaase**: I'm pushing on them and the whole.
**Rthompson**: Ryan, you're concerned about them possibly making us move the A cell, D cell, Lane City, Westfield said that's not happening.
**Rthompson**: It's going to go right where it's at.
**Rthompson**: And so the center points just have to get over it.
**Zach**: Oh, as far as I cover on it.
**Zach**: Yeah, yeah.
**Zach**: You talked to Carlton.
**Rthompson**: Talked to Carlton.
**Rthompson**: I talked to Hunter.
**Rthompson**: I talked to their boss.
**Rthompson**: I talked about everybody about it.
**Rthompson**: So.
**Rthompson**: Because Hunter and their main boss, they were out yesterday and they're like, did you guys get your water tap done?
**Rthompson**: I said no.
**Rthompson**: So I walked them through the whole dilemma and you know, our dirt guy, he's afraid they're gonna do this or they're gonna do this or make us do this.
**Rthompson**: I said nope.
**Rthompson**: So they try to do any of that, we'll put an end to that.
**Rthompson**: So.
**Zach**: Yeah.
**Rthompson**: So site work, you guys have got pretty much everything cut to pad right now for the building area or for the parking lot.
**Rthompson**: We already both know the results on that.
**Rthompson**: You're working on getting a line price to us by Friday.
**Rthompson**: Yes.
**Zach**: Which we'll have it probably today.
**Zach**: One question I had Is when.
**Zach**: When do you guys moving that trailer or where are you going to move that thing to?
**Zach**: The one you're in?
**Rthompson**: Southeast corner, in that green space over there.
**Zach**: Okay.
**Rthompson**: Which I asked the city about that yesterday.
**Rthompson**: They said, no, you're fine to do that.
**Rthompson**: So that gets it out of the parking lot for you and for merit, so that way they can get curbs in.
**Zach**: So the plan is to stabilize everything in the parking lot.
**Zach**: Do you want me to go up into the A D line?
**Zach**: Up into.
**Zach**: I guess we can't really.
**Zach**: Well, I guess.
**Zach**: When do we want to stabilize?
**Rthompson**: We're going to stabilize once we get all the steel up off the ground.
**Rthompson**: Because steel's coming in the next week or so.
**Rthompson**: So we're going to have a shit ton of steel down.
**Zach**: Yeah.
**Rthompson**: And once I get all the steel up, that means water lines in, gas lines in.
**Rthompson**: Pretty much everything underground is in electricals.
**Rthompson**: They're putting their underground stuff into this week, like running from their light poles and everything.
**Rthompson**: They're stubbing all that up this week.
**Rthompson**: So then once all that's in, dude, it's.
**Rthompson**: We're going to let the powers to be, which are above my pay grade, make the decision of what we're doing.
**Rthompson**: But according to our boss and a meeting we just had, he said no, we're going to be lime stabilizing it.
**Zach**: We will be most likely.
**Rthompson**: Right.
**Rthompson**: Well, that tester with Alt woods said nine out of every 10 in this area in Westfield, you just.
**Rthompson**: Nine out of every 10 is lined.
**Zach**: Nine out of 10 jobs that we do are live.
**Rthompson**: Yeah, that's the soil.
**Rthompson**: He said you just.
**Rthompson**: The soil's too.
**Rthompson**: Too much plasticity.
**Zach**: Yeah.
**Rthompson**: So Kagan, you guys are starting out here today, Stoning.
**Brhoades**: Yeah.
**Brhoades**: So our guys out there stoning today.
**Brhoades**: We got our rebar delivery between 8:30 and 9:00 clock.
**Brhoades**: So we'll get that unloaded, shook out, finish tomorrow.
**Brhoades**: Stoning the pad because I think it's roughly 400 ton of stone.
**Rthompson**: I think you're right.
**Brhoades**: Yeah.
**Brhoades**: It's somewhere north of 400 ton.
**Brhoades**: To get that.
**Brhoades**: Just the building pad done.
**Rthompson**: Not.
**Brhoades**: Not including the patio area.
**Rthompson**: Yeah.
**Brhoades**: And then layout coming tomorrow, late morning after we get it stoned up.
**Brhoades**: So he has an area to go off of.
**Brhoades**: So we're not crushing hubs.
**Zach**: Lats.
**Ikaase**: For the volleyball court.
**Ikaase**: The owner wants to do a slight layout change in there, I think.
**Ikaase**: Chad, we talked about this with them last week and they want to make the 10, 10ft on the north side.
**Ikaase**: They're going to put turf down.
**Ikaase**: So when you walk in, you have like a, you know, they could put chairs and stuff down there that aren't in the sand.
**Ikaase**: So as of now, the plan, we'll get it, we'll lay it out and figure out where, where it goes probably just on, on site.
**Ikaase**: And then when you guys cut, cut it out, we'll just leave kind of like a shelf on the north 10ft so that we can put the turf down and then we'll fill, fill the rest of it with sand.
**Ikaase**: So Chad, Katie's getting figuring out if they're going to do the large or the small size court right now.
**Ikaase**: And that'll set, that'll set the poles and then that'll determine how far south they shift it to center.
**Ikaase**: And then if they're going to shift it shift all the courts east to center.
**Ikaase**: So that way when you walk out of the bar restaurant into there, you're not walking right onto a court and they may want to do turf around that.
**Ikaase**: So there's a little two or three foot walkway coming out of there.
**Ikaase**: So we'll just, we'll discuss that.
**Ikaase**: But that'll be part.
**Ikaase**: Just when we cut it out.
**Zach**: I was gonna win that.
**Zach**: So your, your ag peer is in that court.
**Zach**: Right.
**Zach**: So what about grading over there?
**Zach**: Is merit going to handle that as far as the sand and all that goes right up in there where the.
**Rthompson**: Porch is the sand?
**Rthompson**: No, the sand is on the owner.
**Rthompson**: Well, he'll move it in with the skid steer.
**Zach**: Well, I know, but you're in the sand right now.
**Zach**: Right?
**Zach**: So correct as far as moving all that sand out of there.
**Rthompson**: Oh, that little bit.
**Rthompson**: No, we, we've already.
**Rthompson**: He actually he pulled a bunch of that back.
**Rthompson**: That's only, you're only in there about a foot, Ryan.
**Rthompson**: Yeah, yeah, it's not as bad as what everybody thought.
**Rthompson**: It's only probably a foot inside the actual existing chain link fence.
**Rthompson**: Like 10 minutes.
**Rthompson**: What's your duration on when you guys will be done with foundations?
**Rthompson**: Kaden?
**Brhoades**: Right now it's looking like two weeks for foundations.
**Brhoades**: Well, and also too, do you guys have how's your steel?
**Brhoades**: One thing I forgot to ask is what's your crane plan?
**Brhoades**: Where are you guys?
**Brhoades**: Are they going to be setting anything from inside that sand area or inside the building that we need to leave out part of that like grade beam or anything?
**Rthompson**: They're getting us a pick plan right now.
**Rthompson**: Okay, I know he's starting on the southwest corner and then going to work north and then from the volleyball where the volleyball and the restaurant area.
**Rthompson**: Meet up.
**Rthompson**: We're going west to east.
**Rthompson**: So that area down here of the volleyball area will be the last area they set, which is how I also told Tim to do your guys's footers to start down there.
**Rthompson**: That way we can come this way, and that.
**Rthompson**: That concrete has more time to cure.
**Rthompson**: Okay.
**Brhoades**: Yeah, and that's.
**Brhoades**: That's what I think we've planned on since the start.
**Rthompson**: Anything else you need out of us?
**Rthompson**: Kagan, anchor bolts are here on site urgently.
**Rthompson**: I say anchor bolts are here on site for you.
**Rthompson**: Okay.
**Brhoades**: Yeah, those.
**Brhoades**: Those were all there a couple weeks ago.
**Rthompson**: Right.
**Rthompson**: So everything last week, I think, or the week before.
**Brhoades**: Okay.
**Rthompson**: Ryan?
**Zach**: Yeah.
**Rthompson**: You good?
**Zach**: I'm good.
**Rthompson**: Glenn, you got anything else to add?
**Ikaase**: That's it.
**Ikaase**: Thanks, guys.
**Rthompson**: All right.
**Rthompson**: See you, guys.
**Brhoades**: Thank you.
