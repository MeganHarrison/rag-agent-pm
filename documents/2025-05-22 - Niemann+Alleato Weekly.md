## Transcript
**Sclevenger**: Hey.
**Sclevenger**: Hey, Corey.
**Cmortensen**: Hey, Jay.
**Sclevenger**: How you doing?
**Cmortensen**: Not too bad.
**Cmortensen**: Yourself?
**Sclevenger**: Hanging in there.
**Sclevenger**: It's like, I don't know, Memorial Weekend, you know, we got the race here in INDY and it's 52 degrees.
**Sclevenger**: That's not normal.
**Cmortensen**: Right.
**Cmortensen**: I know.
**Cmortensen**: We're cool here, too.
**Sclevenger**: You said that you're in Iowa.
**Sclevenger**: Was.
**Sclevenger**: It wasn't Iowa.
**Sclevenger**: It was Colorado.
**Cmortensen**: Well, from Colorado.
**Sclevenger**: Originally from Colorado.
**Sclevenger**: That's right.
**Cmortensen**: I live in northeast Missouri now.
**Sclevenger**: Okay.
**Cmortensen**: But Quint Neiman's are based out of Quincy, Illinois.
**Sclevenger**: Yeah, I remember.
**Sclevenger**: I.
**Sclevenger**: I knew that.
**Sclevenger**: I think I had already told you, but, you know, I had committed to play baseball at University of Quincy.
**Cmortensen**: Yep, yep, I remember you telling me that.
**Sclevenger**: So I.
**Sclevenger**: I really like the town there.
**Cmortensen**: Did you come play?
**Sclevenger**: I didn't know.
**Sclevenger**: I ended up hanging up the cleats and just going to iu.
**Cmortensen**: I've been to a couple games.
**Cmortensen**: My son, he didn't play college football, but he.
**Cmortensen**: He played on that field a couple times.
**Cmortensen**: And then we went and watched the.
**Cmortensen**: Or not that field.
**Cmortensen**: We went and watched the Quincy Gems.
**Cmortensen**: I guess it would be minor league.
**Sclevenger**: I didn't know they had a minor league team.
**Cmortensen**: I don't know if it's like a farm team or.
**Cmortensen**: I don't know.
**Sclevenger**: Well, okay.
**Sclevenger**: Do you know if Sean's gonna be joining?
**Cmortensen**: I would hope so.
**Sclevenger**: We give it a couple minutes and then we'll get going.
**Sclevenger**: I'm not sure if Brandon or Jesse or Alex will be on.
**Sclevenger**: I like to send out.
**Sclevenger**: I.
**Sclevenger**: I sent you out an agenda, like.
**Sclevenger**: Yeah, 30 minutes ago.
**Sclevenger**: I like to send that out a little earlier.
**Sclevenger**: I just got around to it, though, so I'll also send out some recap, you know, with meeting minutes.
**Sclevenger**: And then I have a specialty little AI note taker here that I have joined the meetings, and it takes notes for us as well, so.
**Cmortensen**: Nice.
**Cmortensen**: I just sent Sean a text, so we'll see if she jumps on here.
**Cmortensen**: I haven't heard from her yet this morning, which is not uncommon, but.
**Sclevenger**: Here she is.
**Sclevenger**: Hey, Sean.
**Cmortensen**: Are you on mute?
**Cmortensen**: Sean?
**Cmortensen**: We can't hear you real well.
**Sclevenger**: It's a little.
**Sclevenger**: A little scratchy.
**Cmortensen**: Yeah, we can tell you're talking, but we can't understand what you're saying.
**Sclevenger**: Do you want me to go ahead and get going, Sean?
**Sclevenger**: And then you can call Corey or call into me and we can.
**Sclevenger**: We can do it that way.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, go ahead.
**Sclevenger**: Oh, there you are.
**Bclymer**: Okay, There you are.
**Sclevenger**: Perfect.
**Bclymer**: Oh, okay.
**Sclevenger**: Nice.
**Sclevenger**: Okay, I'll get rolling here then.
**Sclevenger**: So first.
**Sclevenger**: First thing on the agenda, obviously, is this permitting, I'm not going to call it a snag because I think we got on it pretty early.
**Sclevenger**: Corey, I know we talked.
**Sclevenger**: I think it was early last week or I forget when exactly, but we came up with a solution that the city likes a look of the exterior.
**Sclevenger**: Did you have a chance to look at those drawings?
**Sclevenger**: I had sent that rendering.
**Sclevenger**: I'll pull it up here.
**Sclevenger**: It's okay.
**Sclevenger**: So let me, let me backtrack.
**Sclevenger**: So we, we submitted for our permit.
**Sclevenger**: They responded, yes, you do need an ADLS amendment.
**Sclevenger**: ADLS stands for architecture, Design, Lighting, Landscaping and signage.
**Sclevenger**: So basically, anytime you are upgrading or potentially changing the exterior, Carmel has a say because they care so much about what their city looks like, essentially on what they want that to look like.
**Sclevenger**: So we had that awning, that very nice awning planned.
**Sclevenger**: And they said, no, we don't want you to do an awning.
**Sclevenger**: We want you to make it more inviting, a little more architecturally pretty.
**Sclevenger**: And so they, they want us to match essentially, this portion of the entrance.
**Bclymer**: AJ can they, can they demand that?
**Bclymer**: I mean, they can ask us, but can they require that?
**Bclymer**: I mean, obviously, we've talked about we have no more money.
**Sclevenger**: Right.
**Bclymer**: We've already signed the agreement with FedEx.
**Sclevenger**: Yeah.
**Sclevenger**: So unfortunately, we are at their mercy.
**Sclevenger**: I can fight them as, as much as I want.
**Sclevenger**: And, and we did push back on a couple of their requests.
**Sclevenger**: They had requested more glass at the entrance.
**Sclevenger**: We met them in the middle.
**Sclevenger**: And I'll be honest with you, as far as the money goes, I'm actually, I'm working on pricing this up, but I'm confident we may actually be able to give you some of that money back.
**Sclevenger**: Now, don't hold me to it, but I had requested the being had a steel increase of like 12k, I think it was, and we were splitting that.
**Sclevenger**: I, I mean, I know I'm pretty sure I'm gonna be able to give that back to you.
**Sclevenger**: So it's, it's, it's almost a positive because that, that awning was pretty expensive that we were putting in there.
**Sclevenger**: But yeah, they, they.
**Sclevenger**: It's hard to describe, unfortunately, we are at their, at their mercy or they just won't give us a permit.
**Sclevenger**: And without a permit, we can't start the project here in June and get them in by.
**Sclevenger**: I think it's September 1st is our date.
**Sclevenger**: Is that right, Sean?
**Bclymer**: Something like that, yeah.
**Sclevenger**: That allows for FedEx to come in and set up all of their equipment and their finishes, and then they can open.
**Sclevenger**: I think November 1st was their open date, Is that right?
**Bclymer**: That was.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Their goal.
**Bclymer**: You're right.
**Sclevenger**: Okay.
**Cmortensen**: Yeah, the goal.
**Cmortensen**: I think the goal was, the ultimate goal was to be done with our portion September 1st.
**Cmortensen**: I think the way, I think the way the lease reads, Sean, is like there, there was a drop dead date of like October 1st or something.
**Cmortensen**: And then they needed, they needed to be open by November.
**Cmortensen**: I don't.
**Cmortensen**: That's just going off of memory.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Cmortensen**: But I do know that we're supposed to, we're supposed to turn it over to them September 1st.
**Cmortensen**: But then I think it says somewhere in the lease there that it after.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, we've got a kind of a.
**Cmortensen**: Grace period after a grace period there, I think until October.
**Cmortensen**: And then I think the lease even said that we would start getting fined or something so much.
**Sclevenger**: Oh really?
**Cmortensen**: I'd have to read it.
**Cmortensen**: But.
**Cmortensen**: And I.
**Sclevenger**: Well, I'm.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, anyway, let's.
**Sclevenger**: I'm confident being that September 1st date is what I'm.
**Sclevenger**: I'm gearing up for.
**Sclevenger**: I mean I'm confident in that date.
**Sclevenger**: So let me, let me read through these comments for you guys.
**Sclevenger**: So here's what she had said.
**Sclevenger**: She said discuss with their staff.
**Sclevenger**: They want to enhance the entrance feature for these tenant spaces.
**Sclevenger**: So here's their feedback.
**Sclevenger**: They gave us four bullet points.
**Sclevenger**: Additional storefront windows surrounding the double doors.
**Sclevenger**: Taller and more robust massing of entry feature.
**Sclevenger**: So which to me is.
**Sclevenger**: It's kind of a catch all.
**Sclevenger**: They just didn't like the look of the awning.
**Sclevenger**: Remove the pitch, reflect a flat design to complement the other entrance that I just showed you.
**Sclevenger**: And then build up the columns with masonry to match the other entrance as well.
**Sclevenger**: The red flag for me where there potentially could be an increased cost is this comment that she said right here.
**Cmortensen**: Yeah.
**Cmortensen**: The extra entrance, correct?
**Sclevenger**: Yes, all that.
**Sclevenger**: And so I responded.
**Sclevenger**: So we submitted everything for the.
**Sclevenger**: This amendment.
**Sclevenger**: We submitted our drawings, our renderings.
**Sclevenger**: And I said in my email to her, let me see if I can pull it up here.
**Sclevenger**: I don't want to.
**Sclevenger**: Christina, Jesse.
**Sclevenger**: Yeah.
**Sclevenger**: So I told her we got everything uploaded.
**Sclevenger**: Please know as of now, there's no plan in our scope to move forward with the other tenant work, just the FedEx work.
**Sclevenger**: We just wanted to get it drawn up and then if they find another tenant down the way, we have a plan in place.
**Sclevenger**: This is Martha's future work on our construction documents.
**Sclevenger**: So I kind of left it at that.
**Sclevenger**: I'm gonna wait to see what she responds to that.
**Sclevenger**: Okay.
**Sclevenger**: Because obviously we didn't include for the other entrance.
**Sclevenger**: And they shouldn't.
**Sclevenger**: I.
**Sclevenger**: I will fight them on that.
**Sclevenger**: They should not make us have to put that in because what if we never find another tenant is what I'll tell her.
**Sclevenger**: It's like, then it's just empty storefront.
**Sclevenger**: And Caramel doesn't want that.
**Cmortensen**: Right.
**Sclevenger**: So I'm gonna.
**Sclevenger**: I'm gonna fight tooth and nail on that.
**Sclevenger**: Okay.
**Sclevenger**: That being said, here is what we mocked up for and what she said.
**Sclevenger**: This is an acceptable look.
**Sclevenger**: And the way we'll build this.
**Sclevenger**: And not to go too in depth.
**Sclevenger**: Essentially, we're going to pour column footings, which we already had included for the original awning, and we're going to frame this out of metal studs.
**Cmortensen**: Yep.
**Sclevenger**: Okay.
**Sclevenger**: And then we'll just have some ceiling joists here, and we'll do a flat TPO roof.
**Sclevenger**: And it's only what I have here.
**Sclevenger**: Only 65 square foot of roof.
**Sclevenger**: Okay.
**Sclevenger**: And then we'll have a little cricket with a downspout over here and some metal coping on top.
**Sclevenger**: And we'll do, like, a thin brick masonry veneer to match.
**Sclevenger**: And that's kind of how I foresee it being being built.
**Sclevenger**: So there's really no structural integrity, like bulking up needed for this.
**Sclevenger**: It's not supporting anything.
**Sclevenger**: You know, we may have to beef up these footers to support the masonry.
**Sclevenger**: But other than that, I'm.
**Sclevenger**: I'm confident in the offset of costs just with putting some ballpark numbers to it.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Sclevenger**: So I know we have.
**Sclevenger**: We still have that $10,000 contingency.
**Sclevenger**: I don't want to use it, so I'm working hard so my framer is going to be able to frame it.
**Sclevenger**: Contacted a few masons.
**Sclevenger**: I already got a roofer on pricing this up, and so I've requested, obviously, memorial weekends coming up.
**Sclevenger**: So next week I'll have.
**Sclevenger**: So we'll be meeting Thursday next week.
**Sclevenger**: I'll have numbers for you guys.
**Sclevenger**: Okay.
**Sclevenger**: And I should have a response from Christina on that second entrance.
**Sclevenger**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Well, we'll have to obviously get FedEx's approval.
**Bclymer**: Unless that's something you've.
**Bclymer**: I'm assuming you haven't gone that route.
**Bclymer**: Unless you have.
**Sclevenger**: I.
**Sclevenger**: I have not.
**Sclevenger**: I work for you guys, so I don't want.
**Sclevenger**: I.
**Sclevenger**: I'm not going to reach out to them unless you guys want me to.
**Sclevenger**: And I'm happy to facilitate that discussion, but unfortunately, we don't really.
**Sclevenger**: We don't have a choice.
**Sclevenger**: The city can do what they want.
**Sclevenger**: So either they want the space or they don't.
**Sclevenger**: And I, you know, I don't want to obviously present that ultimatum to him because we.
**Sclevenger**: You guys want them to occupy the space.
**Sclevenger**: So it's like we're.
**Sclevenger**: We're at Carmel's Mercy.
**Sclevenger**: They get to control what the exterior of these buildings look like.
**Sclevenger**: They can't control what the interior looks like, but they can on the exterior.
**Cmortensen**: I agree with you, aj.
**Cmortensen**: I can see that type of entrance being, the way you're building it, being a little bit less than that awning that we had.
**Cmortensen**: Can you.
**Cmortensen**: I guess I would.
**Cmortensen**: I would.
**Cmortensen**: Can you send us that?
**Cmortensen**: Sean, do you want to propose that to FedEx like AJ said?
**Cmortensen**: And I'm familiar with the City of Carnival because we did the Harvest Market, and they are the most difficult city we've worked in to this to the.
**Cmortensen**: To date.
**Bclymer**: Okay?
**Cmortensen**: They.
**Cmortensen**: They're sticklers.
**Cmortensen**: They're right down to the freaking.
**Cmortensen**: How many bike racks we had to have.
**Cmortensen**: They have a bike.
**Cmortensen**: They have a bike rack inspector.
**Cmortensen**: That's his job.
**Sclevenger**: Look, they made me put this on the plans for future.
**Sclevenger**: Show the relocated bike racks.
**Sclevenger**: So we also show the relocated flagpole.
**Cmortensen**: Well, we show that, but there.
**Cmortensen**: There's another one.
**Cmortensen**: I mean, we don't want to relocate that right now.
**Sclevenger**: No, no, no.
**Sclevenger**: I'm.
**Sclevenger**: Like I said, I'm fighting, like, I will fight them on that other entrance, like, because there's no tenant, so it makes sense.
**Cmortensen**: Who's to say we won't?
**Cmortensen**: I mean, if you're fighting it, who's to say we.
**Cmortensen**: We won't expand our grocery store?
**Cmortensen**: I mean, that's just.
**Cmortensen**: It'll never happen, Sean.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Sclevenger**: And now I'm sitting here like.
**Sclevenger**: I'm like, well, fine, I'll just take it off the plans, you know?
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Sclevenger**: Call it Neiman Storage.
**Cmortensen**: Right.
**Sclevenger**: So.
**Bclymer**: And how far did that bump out?
**Sclevenger**: It's.
**Sclevenger**: It's roughly.
**Sclevenger**: I could tell you here.
**Sclevenger**: Three and a half foot.
**Bclymer**: Oh, that's all.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Sclevenger**: Yeah, yeah.
**Sclevenger**: Like I said, they're just wanting to know.
**Sclevenger**: They call it an architectural feature.
**Sclevenger**: So just something to split up that.
**Sclevenger**: Because right now it's just like brick.
**Sclevenger**: Flat brick.
**Sclevenger**: Right, right.
**Sclevenger**: With a new entrance.
**Sclevenger**: They want it to be more inviting.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Sclevenger**: Yeah.
**Cmortensen**: If you could.
**Cmortensen**: If you could send us that.
**Cmortensen**: Yeah, I'm sure.
**Cmortensen**: I'm sure Jerry and Rich would like to see it.
**Cmortensen**: I know Jerry was concerned.
**Cmortensen**: Jerry was the one that kind of said.
**Cmortensen**: Gave his approval on the other awning on our side, Sean.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Cmortensen**: Because it is our building.
**Cmortensen**: We do care what it looks like, for sure.
**Sclevenger**: I don't.
**Cmortensen**: I see this being more cost effective.
**Cmortensen**: And I like, I like it better myself than the metal awning.
**Cmortensen**: And like you said, we're under the mercy of the city, but cost is huge.
**Cmortensen**: Can't go up.
**Sclevenger**: Yeah, yeah.
**Sclevenger**: So I'm.
**Sclevenger**: To me, you know, I was working with my architect, and I kind of presented this solution with him to Christina, because to me, this is the most cost effective way to make the city happy.
**Sclevenger**: At the same time, protect our wallets.
**Sclevenger**: And I even told Christina that.
**Sclevenger**: I was like, we can't.
**Sclevenger**: We can't spend any more money or the deal is going to go away, is what I told her.
**Sclevenger**: And thankfully she was.
**Sclevenger**: She's been really cool to work with.
**Sclevenger**: She was receptive to that.
**Sclevenger**: So, you know, we have some increased glass costs here for adding this transom, but I'm not, you know, I'm confident and when I get these numbers back, this, this offsetting or being the same, so.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So sorry.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, we'll go to work on our end for approvals if you can get us that cost back and let us know how that comes out.
**Sclevenger**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Because I'm sure that will be a stipulation on Rich's part.
**Sclevenger**: Yeah, I'm, I'm moving forward as if this is the route we're going, guys, just to not lose any time in permitting.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Sclevenger**: But then my goal, next Thursday, I'll have these costs for our meeting.
**Sclevenger**: That's my kind of line in the sand.
**Sclevenger**: Hopefully before then.
**Cmortensen**: Yeah, just as soon as get them.
**Cmortensen**: We wouldn't have to necessarily wait for this meeting if you get them sooner than that.
**Sclevenger**: Right.
**Cmortensen**: I'll be traveling most of next week, but.
**Sclevenger**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay, good enough.
**Sclevenger**: So we'll put a pin in that.
**Sclevenger**: I'll keep you guys informed on what she responds to the second entrance, and we'll just keep.
**Sclevenger**: Keep chugging along.
**Sclevenger**: I did send these to you yesterday afternoon or evening.
**Sclevenger**: All of those documents, let me see.
**Cmortensen**: Are they in your.
**Cmortensen**: Your email yesterday?
**Sclevenger**: They're in my email yesterday, yep.
**Sclevenger**: So you can use those with.
**Sclevenger**: With FedEx.
**Sclevenger**: And like I said, if you need me to help facilitate that, I'm happy to chime in.
**Cmortensen**: Yeah, we've got it.
**Cmortensen**: I didn't open them.
**Cmortensen**: I've got it.
**Cmortensen**: Sean, do you have them?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I've been looking at it.
**Sclevenger**: Okay, good, good.
**Sclevenger**: We email issues sometimes.
**Sclevenger**: I just want to make sure that.
**Sclevenger**: That you got it.
**Sclevenger**: Okay.
**Sclevenger**: All right, moving on here to just a couple pre con things.
**Sclevenger**: First one is for our mobilization.
**Sclevenger**: You know, we're gonna have a dumpster there on site for guys to throw trash in, etc.
**Sclevenger**: When we cut these openings in the pre cast, there's going to be some concrete dumpsters needed.
**Sclevenger**: And then you obviously don't want the guys using your toilets there.
**Sclevenger**: So we're going to have a porter pot and I.
**Sclevenger**: I put a little attachment here for us.
**Sclevenger**: This was my suggestion on where we put it.
**Sclevenger**: I've noticed when I've showed up, not a ton of people park right here.
**Sclevenger**: Sometimes it's.
**Sclevenger**: It's employees.
**Sclevenger**: I think that's where I usually park.
**Sclevenger**: But what we do, we'd cone off.
**Sclevenger**: Probably need four spaces for a dumpster, another space for the toilet, and then, you know, one or two spaces for that truck to be able to back in and pick the dumpster up.
**Sclevenger**: Is this an okay area or do you want me to bring it farther down south?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, Corey, I don't know.
**Bclymer**: Do you have an idea?
**Cmortensen**: I think that's the.
**Cmortensen**: Well, from a timing standpoint too, for your construction guys, you don't want to get it too far away.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Cmortensen**: And there's a ton of parking in that parking lot.
**Cmortensen**: So I would think that that's fine being right there.
**Sclevenger**: Yeah.
**Sclevenger**: And eventually, you know, FedEx sign vendor will be putting signs up here is what we've submitted for.
**Bclymer**: That's right.
**Sclevenger**: So kind of blocks that off.
**Sclevenger**: When that happens, I always instruct my guys to park farther away.
**Sclevenger**: So they'll probably park down here as to stay out of the way and then they'll not to jump forward too much.
**Sclevenger**: But as far as our plan goes, we'll be cutting the openings and then filling them with plywood because we don't want this nice new storefront to get damaged.
**Sclevenger**: So the storefront will come in, you know, weeks after and we'll make like a temporary door.
**Sclevenger**: And so that way.
**Sclevenger**: Right now, the only access is this over here.
**Sclevenger**: And this is a fire alarm door.
**Sclevenger**: So we want to just be coming in and out of the front here.
**Sclevenger**: That's how we can get our material in.
**Sclevenger**: That's how we get any trash out.
**Sclevenger**: And that way we're not having to walk all the way through and around the main entrance.
**Sclevenger**: You know, we're going to be staying out of that area.
**Cmortensen**: I think that's a good location for it.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I agree.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I forgot we'd already blocked that off for FedEx.
**Bclymer**: So that works for me.
**Sclevenger**: Okay.
**Sclevenger**: Awesome working times.
**Sclevenger**: When does the site usually open?
**Sclevenger**: Obviously, this will probably only matter at the beginning, I would think, but we usually we have some guys start at 6am but we're usually everybody's on site starting around 7am and then cutting out around 4, 4:30.
**Sclevenger**: Is that okay?
**Cmortensen**: Yeah, I think there are store director there.
**Cmortensen**: He usually gets.
**Cmortensen**: I think the store opens at.
**Cmortensen**: Our store opens at 7.
**Sclevenger**: Okay.
**Cmortensen**: And then our store director is usually there by 6:30 or so.
**Sclevenger**: Okay.
**Cmortensen**: Have you, have you come in, communicated some with him?
**Cmortensen**: Somebody has because.
**Cmortensen**: Have you met Sean?
**Sclevenger**: I haven't.
**Sclevenger**: I've met some people obviously because they've seen me snooping around a little.
**Sclevenger**: I've gotten with and I, I forget her name and I'll remember it as soon as I see her.
**Sclevenger**: But there, there's a lady at the customer service area.
**Sclevenger**: You know when you walk in that entrance and you go to your left and anytime I'm like hey, do you mind letting me in?
**Sclevenger**: And so I, I started to build a little rapport with her.
**Sclevenger**: And then I've seen guys walking around and obviously I make sure I like have a tape measure or something on me so they know what I'm here about.
**Sclevenger**: And I did introduce to myself to a couple guys.
**Sclevenger**: It would have been, this would have been back in November probably though.
**Sclevenger**: So if you could get me some information on like a site contact and then I'll, I'll start that introduction.
**Sclevenger**: I'll get my superintendent with him.
**Sclevenger**: And then all we'll need is just like a, a master key that we'll keep that way in case we need to get into.
**Sclevenger**: Well, we're gonna have to get into the electrical room.
**Sclevenger**: That's the only area where we would need a master key for really.
**Sclevenger**: And then obviously that one side door that goes into that storage area.
**Bclymer**: Well, you need, do you think you'll need a master key outside of the hours of 7 to 4:30 or 6:30 to 4:30?
**Bclymer**: Because I could see there'd be.
**Bclymer**: Corey, maybe you can tell me otherwise.
**Cmortensen**: Maybe.
**Bclymer**: You guys always do this?
**Cmortensen**: No, we do not.
**Cmortensen**: This is kind of a different, different deal.
**Sclevenger**: Yeah, I mean typically, you know, the only people that have it is, is me and my superintendent.
**Sclevenger**: We don't share it.
**Sclevenger**: You know, if we have to keep it on a lockbox, we do.
**Sclevenger**: But we're, we're there in the morning letting guys in.
**Sclevenger**: And the biggest thing is sometimes, you know, if like when we're cutting these openings, it's going to be loud.
**Sclevenger**: We're going to want to start like 6am early, early, early.
**Sclevenger**: And we're gonna have to get inside the building and we don't want any, anybody on your end, you know, to have to be there for that.
**Cmortensen**: So.
**Sclevenger**: Just.
**Sclevenger**: You can.
**Sclevenger**: We don't need it yet, but if you want to powwow with your team, see if we can't get a key to the space, like I said, it'd just be me and my superintendent with it.
**Sclevenger**: You know, we have a lockbox.
**Sclevenger**: We have supervision on this project, so.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, we'll have to run that past security and see how.
**Bclymer**: What their thoughts are.
**Sclevenger**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Sclevenger**: So I usually tell people working times, you know, 6am to 6pm That 12 hour window is when we plan to work.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Cmortensen**: Sean, do you want to get with Keith and Rick and.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah, and I can also get him.
**Bclymer**: Sean's contact there.
**Sclevenger**: Yeah, if you can get me contact information too, because I want to just introduce myself, introduce Alex, pass my card around.
**Sclevenger**: That way if.
**Sclevenger**: In case anything happens, you know, heaven forbid, someone can.
**Sclevenger**: Can call me.
**Sclevenger**: And they don't have to necessarily bother you guys because there'll be instances.
**Sclevenger**: Whoever you're.
**Sclevenger**: Do you have like a building maintenance guy?
**Bclymer**: No, not on site.
**Sclevenger**: Okay.
**Sclevenger**: Well, I just know there's a lot of refrigeration there and so.
**Bclymer**: Oh, I get.
**Bclymer**: I wasn't really laughing at you.
**Bclymer**: It's laughing at the company, so.
**Sclevenger**: Yeah.
**Cmortensen**: Oh, yeah.
**Sclevenger**: No, it's all.
**Sclevenger**: It's all good.
**Sclevenger**: Okay.
**Sclevenger**: Because, you know, we'll have to.
**Sclevenger**: When we do our sprinkler system and do our fire alarm, we have to put the building in test mode and let your monitoring company know.
**Sclevenger**: Hey, you know, we're working on it and we'll.
**Sclevenger**: We handle all of that, but we have a site contact.
**Sclevenger**: I need to let him know before we do that, obviously.
**Bclymer**: Right, right.
**Bclymer**: Sean would be able to help you there.
**Sclevenger**: Okay, perfect.
**Sclevenger**: Okay, so that.
**Sclevenger**: That covers our mobilization then.
**Sclevenger**: Any questions or.
**Cmortensen**: I don't have any.
**Bclymer**: I don't.
**Sclevenger**: Awesome.
**Sclevenger**: All right, final thing I have for us to just briefly go through, and I touched on it a little, is our construction schedule.
**Sclevenger**: I will share this with you guys.
**Sclevenger**: This is my preliminary schedule as of now.
**Sclevenger**: So right now we're in the city of Carmel review.
**Sclevenger**: I'm hoping to have that back by June 4th.
**Sclevenger**: Once.
**Sclevenger**: Once we receive those permits here on June 5th, which this may.
**Sclevenger**: This is probably going to bleed a little bit, but I have some.
**Sclevenger**: Some contingency built in here with my mobilization.
**Sclevenger**: Another week in contingency with that.
**Sclevenger**: So we'll mobilize and I'm demoing the existing lights and.
**Sclevenger**: And starting our saw cut for the doors.
**Sclevenger**: Middle of June.
**Sclevenger**: Okay.
**Sclevenger**: And.
**Sclevenger**: And then we'll move on.
**Sclevenger**: You know, while we're doing that Little bit of exterior work.
**Sclevenger**: We can start a little bit on the interior.
**Sclevenger**: We'll get those plywood panels up.
**Sclevenger**: And then I have our final inspection happening Thursday, 8.
**Sclevenger**: 28 with.
**Sclevenger**: With the turnover date to FedEx on September one.
**Cmortensen**: You think that that 28th final inspection gives you enough time?
**Cmortensen**: Because there will be things.
**Cmortensen**: We had a hell of a time when they were inspecting our harvest market and we cut it right down to the wire on our open date.
**Sclevenger**: Are you saying Carmel, the city of Carmel, inspectors?
**Sclevenger**: Yeah, yeah.
**Sclevenger**: I mean, with this scope, it's a big wall, but we're building essentially one wall.
**Sclevenger**: Right.
**Sclevenger**: And there's really not a ton of electrical.
**Sclevenger**: What I'm saying is.
**Sclevenger**: And I, I may need to delete that final inspection portion because I submitted FedEx's electrical drawing with my set.
**Sclevenger**: Okay.
**Sclevenger**: So I don't think we can actually close the permit out for occupancy until FedEx is able to put their fixtures in.
**Sclevenger**: And then my electricians come in behind and do the electrical.
**Sclevenger**: So that, that's something that I want to cover in a meeting with them.
**Sclevenger**: So this is, I should say, turn over to FedEx.
**Sclevenger**: That way they can start moving in, installing their, their flooring, doing their painting, etc, because I, I'll be honest with you, I've never done.
**Sclevenger**: A lot of times we just do the construction for the tenant.
**Sclevenger**: Right.
**Sclevenger**: And so this one's a little odd that they're under my permit, but it's kind of uncharted territory.
**Sclevenger**: I've been on the other end with like Great Clips franchises.
**Sclevenger**: So that's.
**Sclevenger**: That's the most recent one I did.
**Cmortensen**: Yeah, I see there.
**Cmortensen**: Yeah, I see.
**Cmortensen**: I see what you're getting at though.
**Cmortensen**: That 28 is just turn over to them that.
**Cmortensen**: I mean, there might be.
**Cmortensen**: There's going to be some final inspections before they can open.
**Sclevenger**: Right.
**Sclevenger**: I don't know.
**Sclevenger**: In Carmel.
**Sclevenger**: I'd have to jog my memory if they have to get like a certain.
**Sclevenger**: I mean, they, they have other FedExes in Carmel.
**Sclevenger**: So.
**Sclevenger**: So sometimes there's like a certain business occupancy you have to do.
**Sclevenger**: And this, this right here is a little fluid.
**Sclevenger**: We will be done with our scope by 9.
**Sclevenger**: 1.
**Sclevenger**: For them to do their thing.
**Sclevenger**: That's my target date.
**Sclevenger**: I think we will have to come in and then do some electrical with.
**Sclevenger**: Once they get their equipment installed.
**Cmortensen**: Right.
**Sclevenger**: So what I'll do is I'll actually adjust this.
**Sclevenger**: I'm kind of thinking out loud now, now that we've talked about it, I'll adjust this to to add some lag in there to show.
**Sclevenger**: Okay.
**Sclevenger**: You know, landlord scope, done.
**Sclevenger**: 9:1 and then FedEx electrical, and then I'll put final inspection and we can share this with FedEx in a meeting and, and kind of get their.
**Sclevenger**: Their two cents.
**Cmortensen**: Sounds good.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Sclevenger**: Okay.
**Sclevenger**: Well, it's 10:30.
**Sclevenger**: I like to make these kind of short and sweet as much as possible.
**Sclevenger**: Obviously, we have a lot to get through right now in this initial one, but I know your guys time is valuable.
**Sclevenger**: So you guys have any questions for me?
**Bclymer**: I do not.
**Bclymer**: Do we want to add FedEx?
**Bclymer**: Well, I'll let you decide when you want FedEx to have that conversation with them where.
**Bclymer**: Okay, I'm good.
**Sclevenger**: What, what I would like to do, you know, I'm going to keep our weekly huddle, just us, and then maybe do a BI weekly with FedEx.
**Sclevenger**: I know I had responded and mentioned doing a meeting and I think even Nissing wanted to be involved.
**Sclevenger**: I'm going to leave that up to you guys.
**Sclevenger**: You know, they can maybe be involved with the FedEx portion just because I know they were part of the deal.
**Sclevenger**: But I'm thinking maybe bi weekly with them and, and I want to be that liaison for you guys.
**Sclevenger**: So you're welcome to be there.
**Sclevenger**: You know, if you can't make it, I'm.
**Sclevenger**: I'm happy to handle that, that, that meeting for you guys.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I mean, that works with me.
**Bclymer**: We'll talk internally about knee sinks involved.
**Bclymer**: Sometimes you just get too many parties.
**Bclymer**: But I'll have to see what how Rich feels about that.
**Sclevenger**: Well, I'll be, you know, leading that meeting and guiding it.
**Sclevenger**: And, and so.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Sclevenger**: And it's.
**Sclevenger**: It's merely just so we can have one time huddle.
**Sclevenger**: Hey, here's where we're at, guys.
**Sclevenger**: We're tracking on September 1st.
**Sclevenger**: Here's what I need from you because now we're actually pulling their sign permit for them.
**Sclevenger**: So there is some conversation that has to go on with their sign vendor.
**Sclevenger**: And, and I'm not sure if that's.
**Sclevenger**: I'm not sure it's necessary to have that weekly.
**Sclevenger**: I think we do it bi weekly.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Cmortensen**: I agree.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Sclevenger**: I get.
**Sclevenger**: So I have so many weekly meetings.
**Sclevenger**: Nice to do a bi weekly one.
**Cmortensen**: I'm in the same boat.
**Cmortensen**: It's hard to get anything done for all the meetings.
**Sclevenger**: They are necessary, though, so they are.
**Sclevenger**: Okay, well, I got my marching orders.
**Sclevenger**: If I'll get these meeting notes typed up and we'll go from there.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Sounds good to me.
**Sclevenger**: Yep.
**Sclevenger**: It was nice to, to meet you guys and a face to the name and hopefully here soon.
**Sclevenger**: We'll get to grab lunch or something.
**Sclevenger**: You guys just let me know when you're in town, okay?
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: I will get back to you with Rich.
**Bclymer**: Hopefully very soon.
**Sclevenger**: Yep.
**Sclevenger**: All righty, guys.
**Bclymer**: Okay, thank you.
**Bclymer**: Bye.
**Cmortensen**: Thanks.
