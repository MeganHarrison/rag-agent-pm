## Transcript
**Aelkarrimy**: Hey, Jesse, how you doing?
**Bclymer**: Good, Mike.
**Bclymer**: What's up?
**Jdawson**: What's going on?
**Bclymer**: Just working.
**Bclymer**: My favorite thing to do.
**Bclymer**: Hey, Ahmed, you able to hear me?
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah, I can hear you.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Everyone went silent, so I didn't know if my screen locked up again or what.
**Mparsons**: No, no.
**Bclymer**: Stuff's been acting up.
**Bclymer**: Are we waiting on someone or.
**Kevin.ly**: I think we're still waiting on Yusuke to join me.
**Kevin.ly**: Just quick message.
**Kevin.ly**: Try calling him one more time just to see.
**Bclymer**: So is it earlier or later over there?
**Kevin.ly**: It's earlier.
**Jdawson**: It's like 6:30 in the morning.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: But our office starts at 7 o' clock in Japan, so it's not that early.
**Bclymer**: I gotcha.
**Kevin.ly**: Could have asked this call to be early in the morning, but now you know why I did not.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, well, so I guess there's a little pain on both sides.
**Bclymer**: You got to get extra early.
**Bclymer**: We stay a little late.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I sent him a chat as well, but I don't see him as active on teams.
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah, I tried to recall.
**Mparsons**: Yeah, we can.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Get started for the non change order related.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: That's okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Let's see.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Once he joins, we can get the change order for.
**Bclymer**: Kevin.
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah, I'll let you guys take it from here.
**Kevin.ly**: We'll go through the meeting minutes and then hopefully Isuke would join by then.
**Kevin.ly**: And then we could go through the change order.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: You gonna share your screen?
**Mparsons**: Yeah, just gonna start with updates on the test site.
**Mparsons**: Mike, if you want to talk about what's happening right now on the job site.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah.
**Aelkarrimy**: So we're progressing on the lights this week.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yesterday we finished the relocation of the lights in plan A and today we started the installation of the new lights in plan B.
**Aelkarrimy**: And that should be wrapped up by the end of this week.
**Aelkarrimy**: So we're a little ahead of schedule on the on the lights.
**Aelkarrimy**: Otherwise that's all that's going on on site right now.
**Bclymer**: We're not seeing your screen.
**Bclymer**: Keba, you sharing the meeting?
**Mparsons**: Some reason I'm seeing just blank white.
**Bclymer**: Teams has been.
**Bclymer**: We've had troubles with it this week.
**Bclymer**: Like try to share your screen and just doesn't show anything.
**Mparsons**: Yeah.
**Mparsons**: Is it up now?
**Mparsons**: You guys see it?
**Bclymer**: Nope.
**Bclymer**: Just log out and log back in.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: I'm gonna.
**Kevin.ly**: Jobs matter daily report.
**Kevin.ly**: You guys want me to share it?
**Kevin.ly**: I can.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Well, he's gonna log back in.
**Bclymer**: Sometimes that's all it takes.
**Bclymer**: And then it works.
**Bclymer**: There we go.
**Bclymer**: You're muted, Kevin.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: So the slow remediation was also done last weekend.
**Mparsons**: And like Mike said, the high day lighter being Installed and possibly finishing by the end of this week.
**Mparsons**: So the change orders.
**Mparsons**: I guess we'll talk about that when we see the join this.
**Mparsons**: Oh, is the IRC with us now?
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: And on the schedule too.
**Mparsons**: So we are moving along as planned, but there would be possible delays depending on where, what direction we are going with the new transformers or if we are sticking with the ones we originally priced.
**Bclymer**: It's kind of a double edged sword because to prevent having four extra 45 KVA transformers we don't need, he was able to stop two of them at the factory before they shot him out the door.
**Bclymer**: So we just need to make a decision on that as quick as possible.
**Bclymer**: And if we're going back to the, you know, needing three of them, we'll have to finish making one.
**Bclymer**: Or if we go back to the original, then they got to make two.
**Kevin.ly**: Jesse, did we gather like a timeline for either of these paths?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, it's.
**Bclymer**: Well, the new transfer, what are they?
**Bclymer**: Six to eight weeks, Kevin?
**Mparsons**: Correct.
**Mparsons**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And then on the schedule we were going to install them when Mike?
**Mparsons**: I think the final connection was September.
**Mparsons**: I think 14th for plan B and plan A is in October.
**Mparsons**: That's what we have in the schedule.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So six to eight weeks from now is when like if we make like we made a decision today, where does that put us?
**Bclymer**: So it's possible.
**Jdawson**: We'll see.
**Mparsons**: Yeah.
**Mparsons**: If, if, if we are able to get even early next week, if we're able to complete an order by then, we should be able to get them in in time.
**Bclymer**: Still be on schedule.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Mparsons**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Kevin.ly**: And this is the case for either like the, the smaller ones or the bigger ones, right?
**Mparsons**: Correct.
**Kevin.ly**: Perfect.
**Kevin.ly**: Okay, so we're good there.
**Kevin.ly**: All right, so hopefully after we're done with the meeting minutes, Cody has some good news for us and then we'll, we'll figure out which path we need to go through.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Kevin.ly**: Kevin and Mike, did you guys issue a revised schedule by any chance?
**Mparsons**: No, not yet.
**Mparsons**: So a lot of the things that we are thinking about changing would depend on the transformers.
**Mparsons**: Otherwise.
**Mparsons**: I mean we did finish the relocation of the lights.
**Mparsons**: We did finish that ahead of schedule.
**Mparsons**: And we were able to start the installation of the new high day light.
**Mparsons**: And that also might be.
**Mparsons**: It's ahead of, ahead of schedule.
**Bclymer**: And our plumber, he's got the, he has his, you know, the sand oil separator and everything ordered.
**Bclymer**: So as soon as it gets in, he'll be on site doing his install as well.
**Kevin.ly**: Gotcha.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: Yes.
**Mparsons**: So in terms of billing we are planning on billing for the materials that we have on site and the work that is completed for now, including some general conditions and project management town sending that out for next billing and whatever change order is approved before then.
**Kevin.ly**: Right now, Cody, Brian and Joe, do we.
**Kevin.ly**: Guys.
**Kevin.ly**: Do you guys want to go over what we found out this week regarding the transformers and all that?
**Kevin.ly**: Like has everything been confirmed, the KVAs and all that information?
**Jdawson**: So what's happening here?
**Kevin.ly**: We're le.
**Jdawson**: We're definitely leaning towards removing the transformers.
**Jdawson**: We just were looking for.
**Mparsons**: A little.
**Jdawson**: More clarity from a few vendors if they can.
**Jdawson**: I mean it's not a matter of if.
**Jdawson**: If it can be done.
**Jdawson**: It's a matter of if they do it or we have to have our electrician do it.
**Jdawson**: Our one of our people is coming back next week that should be able to help clarify some of this to give us the stamp that says that that's okay.
**Jdawson**: There's a bigger issue that has to do with their actual boxes, with the cardboard boxes on what kind of boxes we go with.
**Jdawson**: Those came in actually today.
**Jdawson**: So we have been doing a lot of testing with it and there should be a decision made by the end of the week or the end of next week on what direction we're going to go in.
**Jdawson**: So, you know, there's two different ways.
**Jdawson**: There's one that is going to say, hey, keep everything as it is.
**Jdawson**: And then we can proceed with either our two options that we have here in the change orders or B B would swap different equipment.
**Jdawson**: It wouldn't change where the drops are, but we would be using different machines because we would be going with litting machines instead of boxes with flaps.
**Jdawson**: And honestly I think it would bring the power down.
**Jdawson**: I think the plan that we have right now is at the max.
**Jdawson**: We will never go over that.
**Kevin.ly**: So that's good news.
**Jdawson**: But we would.
**Jdawson**: If we're going with plan B to change the boxes, it's definitely going.
**Jdawson**: We're definitely going to hit that delay period for sure because that decision and figuring out the new machines won't come quickly by any means.
**Jdawson**: So we're really trying to stick with the plan that we have in place.
**Jdawson**: We're running a lot of tests on the demo system we have here in the office.
**Jdawson**: It's.
**Mparsons**: We're.
**Jdawson**: We're teetering.
**Jdawson**: You know, the results of the testing is basically teetering on 50 50.
**Jdawson**: So we have to wait for the actual team that's in New Jersey at the site for Uniqlo.
**Jdawson**: They're in Europe right now, which would be Utah San and Minae San, and they kind of are the decision makers in this as well.
**Jdawson**: So they get back next week, and we hope to have a lot more information by this call next week.
**Bclymer**: And Joe, what does that.
**Bclymer**: What does that mean?
**Bclymer**: I guess broadly, what you're saying is the.
**Jdawson**: Probably what I'm saying.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, what I'm saying is these boxes.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: And I don't want to go into the complete issues that we're having with them, but the Uniqlo likes to use these boxes that have flaps.
**Jdawson**: Our system cannot have free flying flaps because it could run into the rails or something like that.
**Jdawson**: So they have to have these little tabs on them.
**Bclymer**: What?
**Jdawson**: Well, for their largest box, the tabs create a giant problem when you try to fold them down.
**Jdawson**: And if we have to change the boxes that are used, that changes the machinery that not only erects the boxes, but also closes the boxes.
**Bryan.wagar**: All right.
**Jdawson**: Go ahead.
**Kevin.ly**: I think.
**Kevin.ly**: I think someone spoke by accident, Joe.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Okay, that's fine.
**Jdawson**: Just to keep everybody informed.
**Jdawson**: Yes, if we have to change the boxes, it will change the machinery on the outbound area.
**Jdawson**: It will not change where all the drops are, as we said.
**Jdawson**: But yes, the power requirements would change and they would possibly drop, which is why I said last.
**Jdawson**: Last week or the week before, let's get these change orders quoted.
**Jdawson**: But let's.
**Jdawson**: We are not going to be ordering or changing anything as of yet.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so what.
**Jdawson**: So there's two decisions.
**Jdawson**: There's one, what boxes are we going with?
**Jdawson**: And then that affects the second one, which is, do we go with either of these change orders, or do we have to go with a third option that we don't even know what it is yet?
**Kevin.ly**: And if we go with that option where we don't know where it is yet, does that mean we are on pause just until this is ironed out for.
**Jdawson**: That means we are paused on electrical for the outbound area.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Kevin.ly**: But the power for the SkyPods remain the same and we keep running everything the same way.
**Jdawson**: Everything that's Skypod and north of the Skypod will be the same.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Okay, can you.
**Kevin.ly**: The other option would be going with either of those change orders and sticking to the same old plan if they stick to the older boxes that you guys have accounted for.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Jdawson**: And.
**Jdawson**: And that's kind of.
**Jdawson**: And that's kind of our.
**Jdawson**: Why we don't want to return anything just yet or order anything new or do any of that.
**Jdawson**: Because.
**Jdawson**: Because if we go with this, if we go with the third option, the unknown option, it could very well drop, you know, because we're going to be using less machinery, but it's larger machinery, but it will drop the power.
**Jdawson**: So honestly, we're kind of.
**Jdawson**: We're up in the air on what has to happen, but it very well could end up being.
**Jdawson**: We can use the stuff we ordered from the very beginning and we can avoid all of this.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Bclymer**: And that's like maybe a week away from getting results.
**Jdawson**: Looking at a week, probably two weeks, to be honest.
**Kevin.ly**: Okay, we come back.
**Kevin.ly**: You said next week.
**Jdawson**: When do you know the team comes back next week?
**Jdawson**: Monday.
**Jdawson**: We have calls with them on Wednesday.
**Jdawson**: We'll probably talk to them before that.
**Jdawson**: There's also a steering call with the leadership teams from Exotech and Uniqlo on Thursday before the 4th.
**Jdawson**: So that's kind of, you know, the, all those, all those meetings are just to decide on the first part.
**Jdawson**: What kind of boxes are we going to go with then?
**Jdawson**: Step two, power is decided based on which box we go with.
**Kevin.ly**: Now, now, Joe, based on our call last week with this option where we, where we came up with the.
**Kevin.ly**: The new.
**Kevin.ly**: The new option with the transformers.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Kevin.ly**: Did we confirm the information that that would work if they stick to those boxes?
**Kevin.ly**: Let's say, hypothetically, Uniqlo says let's stick to those boxes that work with our current system.
**Kevin.ly**: Are we okay with that option from last, Cody?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, Cody, do we have confirmation that that will work or do we still need to get confirmation from one of the vendors?
**Bschwartz**: So in terms of the confirmation from the vendors, we still need to get some.
**Bschwartz**: But even then, we still have the option of just doing it through the transformers ourselves.
**Bschwartz**: I think the only overarching thing that we had that I needed to get back to you guys on was just letting you know if any of the KVAs or anything like that changed.
**Bschwartz**: And I went ahead and I went through the calculations and the KVAs wouldn't change.
**Bschwartz**: So, like, all the wires would still be following the accurate data that we gave earlier.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So we're not confirmed just yet that the cheaper option will work, but we're 98% there.
**Jdawson**: So in terms of keeping this, this call a little shorter and not going over when we start talking about this change order, I suggest we.
**Jdawson**: We probably just talk about the smaller one because I have some questions as well.
**Kevin.ly**: But regardless, if we say we have a direction on the ninth by the.
**Kevin.ly**: Well, you said your calls are on Thursday, though.
**Jdawson**: Wednesday and Thursday.
**Kevin.ly**: Wednesday And Thursday the 16th, let's call it, then we would have a direction by the 16th would be great.
**Kevin.ly**: This way Eliato would know by July 16th whether they should order what they need to order.
**Kevin.ly**: And six weeks from there, we're looking at August 27th.
**Kevin.ly**: What date, Kemba, did you say you need to install?
**Kevin.ly**: Start the installation of Transformers.
**Jdawson**: Transformers.
**Jdawson**: One of them on Plan A says September 4th and the other says October.
**Jdawson**: October.
**Jdawson**: Can't find the other one.
**Jdawson**: October 2nd.
**Kevin.ly**: So, Jesse, I think just so the electrician is aware, just give him a heads up that we would try to have a finalized direction hopefully by July 16th, worst case scenario, end of that week.
**Kevin.ly**: And then it's like, would.
**Kevin.ly**: Would it stick to six, six to eight weeks from there.
**Kevin.ly**: And if they could do six weeks, it would be great.
**Kevin.ly**: I don't know if you.
**Kevin.ly**: If you guys can ask them that, but that we are definitely going to go with either of those options.
**Kevin.ly**: But we will give them a final direction by that date.
**Bclymer**: And you said one side can.
**Bclymer**: Joe, do you mind just circling on a map or on a plan?
**Bclymer**: Everything that don't matter what decisions made on these boxes, this is going to stay this way.
**Bclymer**: And at least then you know we're not holding up on everything if we don't have to.
**Jdawson**: Say that one more time.
**Bclymer**: Jesse, you were saying the.
**Bclymer**: I think you said that the inbound will remain the same no matter what.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Jdawson**: Can you show that?
**Jdawson**: Can you show that?
**Bschwartz**: Yeah, let me pull up.
**Bschwartz**: I was looking for the exact drawing that was sent last time, and I couldn't find that one.
**Bschwartz**: But I do have the one that I shared last time.
**Bschwartz**: So I'll reshare my screen with that drawing.
**Bclymer**: One second.
**Bschwartz**: Can you guys see it?
**Kevin.ly**: Yep.
**Bschwartz**: Okay.
**Bschwartz**: Yeah.
**Bschwartz**: So the.
**Bschwartz**: The three up here where my mouse currently is.
**Bschwartz**: So the two in the red and then the one in the black, these would be staying the same.
**Bschwartz**: And then the two in the red at the bottom would be staying the same.
**Bschwartz**: But the three at the bottom is what could end up changing.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, if you can just circle those and.
**Bclymer**: Or call them out and send it to everybody.
**Bclymer**: Okay then.
**Bclymer**: Because if there's no reason holding that stuff up, then we can definitely at least get that limit we're waiting on.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bschwartz**: Yeah, I can get a drawing put together.
**Bschwartz**: I'll find the original one and I'll make some new edits to it because like I said, this was the one that I made some edits to.
**Bschwartz**: But I'll send something over for sure.
**Bclymer**: All right, thank you.
**Kevin.ly**: And Keba, did we.
**Kevin.ly**: Did we ask regarding any restocking fees?
**Kevin.ly**: What's that really going to look like if we were to go with the.
**Mparsons**: Other option, as far as the transformers, there are some that were already ordered that we cannot return and electrician has those and the two that were canceled, they didn't even ship, so there was no fee associated with those.
**Mparsons**: But if we were to, I guess whatever he was able to cancel, he canceled.
**Mparsons**: But what he has now he cannot send back.
**Kevin.ly**: Can you confirm what we have in stock?
**Kevin.ly**: Those two.
**Kevin.ly**: Specifically those two units.
**Kevin.ly**: This way the team is aware that we need to try to work around hopefully trying to maintain them rather than losing these two.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Kevin.ly**: And just make sure Exotech and Henderson are on that email.
**Kevin.ly**: Just so then when we have a final decision on the 16th, we take a look at what we have as an inventory before we make that decision.
**Mparsons**: Gotcha.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Kevin.ly**: And then I guess lastly, Kevin, if you can walk us through the change orders.
**Kevin.ly**: I see the three attachments but I just want you to kind of just walk us through the two options.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: I would go into, go through this email from Joseph but address the questions.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: So this one, just like I explained.
**Mparsons**: So two of them were.
**Bclymer**: They were able to just.
**Bclymer**: Can you share your screen to show the change order and then just go through each line and say what it, what it means?
**Bclymer**: No, the change order Keba.
**Kevin.ly**: Or 2.
**Bclymer**: So this is the one where we don't install the high, you know, the 125 KVA transformers.
**Bclymer**: We simply run higher amp bridge feeders to those locations.
**Mparsons**: Yes.
**Mparsons**: So the credit here is for two transformers that we are able to stop from shipping and the other two were already shipped so we can't return them.
**Mparsons**: And so we already have those so we can get credit for that.
**Kevin.ly**: So this, so this 879-3168, that is for upsizing the cabling without the transformer, right?
**Bclymer**: Correct.
**Kevin.ly**: Okay.
**Kevin.ly**: And so this was option 2A.
**Bclymer**: And I did like there was some other changes on the drawings.
**Bclymer**: Electrician had called out and he put everything in.
**Bclymer**: He didn't break it up.
**Bclymer**: So that's why they were on here.
**Bclymer**: And you know, I know some of Joe's questions were what do these have to do with his, you know, his scope?
**Bclymer**: So those are something we'll have to break out.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Jesse, I.
**Jdawson**: And I know I saw it and I didn't want to include everybody on just my questions personally from, from Exotech.
**Jdawson**: But obviously this change order has stuff that, you know, was.
**Jdawson**: Is not just, is not just Exotech involvement here.
**Jdawson**: So just to let you know too.
**Jdawson**: And I'm sure Kevin on the Call can.
**Jdawson**: Can confirm that after working with Uniglo for, you know, I'm sure Ahmed can confirm too, knowing that they're definitely going to request that each of these be broken down.
**Jdawson**: If we.
**Jdawson**: If we can do that.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And there's no delay fees in here.
**Bclymer**: That was.
**Bclymer**: That was.
**Bclymer**: Think he was just writing that.
**Bclymer**: It's possible if, you know, decisions weren't made in time.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: Like that.
**Mparsons**: No, we get it.
**Bclymer**: Go away.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: Okay, let's keep going.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: So.
**Mparsons**: And this one is for.
**Mparsons**: This is part of the.
**Mparsons**: The addendum 1 drawings that you received from.
**Mparsons**: From Ahmed.
**Mparsons**: So there were five drops that were added to the drawing that were not in the original.
**Mparsons**: So we.
**Mparsons**: I guess we can break that as well if needed.
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah.
**Kevin.ly**: But kebab, keep in mind that we purchased a certain amount of drops.
**Mparsons**: Correct.
**Kevin.ly**: And then we just relocated some of them.
**Kevin.ly**: So I definitely want to see how much you're going to charge for that partial relocation because it's not that big of a relocate.
**Kevin.ly**: But I know that we had, I believe, 17 or 16 outlets in the bid.
**Kevin.ly**: In the bid document.
**Mparsons**: Right.
**Mparsons**: Yeah, I think some of it was.
**Mparsons**: I think if I remember correctly, you were saying because of the distance, he had to add more.
**Mparsons**: More cables and stuff.
**Mparsons**: So get that also added to the cost.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Kevin.ly**: So definitely break it out.
**Kevin.ly**: We definitely need to see like how the linear feet that you're purchasing, how much it costs per square foot and then the final total.
**Kevin.ly**: Just so that we understand that that sum.
**Mparsons**: Gotcha.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: And so these are leaders associated with the relocation of some of the transformers.
**Kevin.ly**: Fire for data conduits.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So, you know, I'm not an electrician.
**Jdawson**: I don't.
**Jdawson**: I don't know what this means, but how.
**Jdawson**: How does this.
**Jdawson**: Brian, maybe you can help or.
**Jdawson**: Sorry.
**Bclymer**: So, yeah, so when the.
**Bclymer**: The 75 KVA feeds are not big enough to handle the 125amp load.
**Bclymer**: So they're just.
**Bclymer**: They've already ordered.
**Bclymer**: You know, they had all this wire ordered previously.
**Bclymer**: It's all cut to length and it's whatever size set of that run.
**Bclymer**: So this is just an upsizing and a reorder of that wire to the new size required.
**Bclymer**: I can look at the drawing like they had.
**Jdawson**: I thought we weren't going to need to order any new wire.
**Bclymer**: No, the.
**Bclymer**: The wire that was sized there wasn't size big enough.
**Bclymer**: So we'll confirm that.
**Bclymer**: Like you said, we'll break it down, give you like, you know, the linear foot of the change of what changed in the wire sizes so that it that's something like two we can mark up on a drawing.
**Bclymer**: That would better explain all this and attach it.
**Bclymer**: And then, you know, the breakers that were in there were 75amp breakers, I believe, previously.
**Bclymer**: And so they've changed them to 125.
**Bclymer**: And all that stuff ordered with the panel is, you know, you'll have extra 75amp breakers.
**Jdawson**: The only.
**Jdawson**: The only question I have from that is install a lot of this.
**Jdawson**: We shouldn't.
**Jdawson**: I.
**Jdawson**: I would think we shouldn't have any.
**Jdawson**: There shouldn't be, like, provide an install.
**Jdawson**: There shouldn't be any install cost.
**Jdawson**: This should be all material, correct.
**Bclymer**: Most of it.
**Bclymer**: The one thing, like, you know, sometimes they're parallel runs to get that capacity.
**Bclymer**: So instead of just one conduit, they're running across the ceiling.
**Bclymer**: They get it.
**Bclymer**: They're adding additional installation costs from that perspective.
**Bclymer**: So we'll verify all that, too, and give you the details on it.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: The four fire alarm conduits, is that not.
**Bclymer**: So that would be something related to the building.
**Bclymer**: So we'll get that broke out and show on a plan, whatever was changed.
**Bclymer**: But I wouldn't think that has anything to do with your.
**Bclymer**: The transformer issue, Ahmed.
**Jdawson**: Is that a separate conversation that you all have been having?
**Cheryl.green**: No.
**Jdawson**: I'm not even sure.
**Kevin.ly**: Brian, is this something that's new.
**Cheryl.green**: In terms of fire alarm.
**Cheryl.green**: We don't have any fire alarm scope on Henderson's drawings.
**Cheryl.green**: The data conduits would.
**Cheryl.green**: I mean, could potentially be the ones for.
**Cheryl.green**: No, because you guys already have those accounted for for the five desks and the light item two above that.
**Cheryl.green**: So I don't have anything that's adding four fire alarm and four data conduits.
**Bclymer**: Well, I think it'll be better.
**Bclymer**: And I know Kev was just trying to rush to get these things out, but we're gonna.
**Bclymer**: We just need to add the drawing backup of, you know, the.
**Bclymer**: The change that was related to each of these things, and we'll get that added, and that'll help.
**Kevin.ly**: And a more detailed breakdown, Jesse.
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah, and more like a little more detailed breakdowns because, like Joe said, the installation of power and whatnot, like that was already.
**Kevin.ly**: It should be in the scope.
**Kevin.ly**: So I'm not sure why we're being charged again for installing power.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Kevin.ly**: Okay.
**Kevin.ly**: Kevin, you want to go through 2B?
**Mparsons**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: What about.
**Jdawson**: Well, go back.
**Jdawson**: Go back to the other one.
**Jdawson**: Just real quick, what you just had pulled up the pneumatic.
**Jdawson**: The power for pneumatic box, was that not on the.
**Jdawson**: The.
**Jdawson**: The bids on the.
**Mparsons**: Yeah, sure.
**Mparsons**: This Is this is another one, my own, that we just.
**Mparsons**: I just included everything that.
**Mparsons**: That was on the drawing that Cody was sharing earlier.
**Mparsons**: Correct.
**Jdawson**: But we always should have had a power drop for the pneumatic power box.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I'm looking at.
**Bclymer**: I was looking at that just briefly for the meeting.
**Bclymer**: And all I could tell other than, you know, because they had the two compressors, they were over kind of in the middle of the floor and it showed a box over back by the bathrooms.
**Bclymer**: So I'll have to get.
**Bclymer**: I'll have to get in that and see if it.
**Bclymer**: It then again is just a relocation of where they're having to run the power to because it's coming all the way across the warehouse to the backside and instead of stopping in the middle of the floor, it's going to the exterior wall.
**Bclymer**: So that.
**Bclymer**: That's another thing we'll mark up on the drawings and just see if it's really something that.
**Bclymer**: And give us.
**Kevin.ly**: Was that something that we were supposed to show on our drawings or no?
**Cheryl.green**: Which pneumatic power box is this?
**Cheryl.green**: Is this for the compressors?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, for the compressors is what I would think.
**Jdawson**: That's what I'm assuming that is.
**Cheryl.green**: We.
**Cheryl.green**: We already had those on our drawings from day one.
**Cheryl.green**: So.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, we'll look at that again.
**Bclymer**: We'll look at all these and get them back to you.
**Bclymer**: You'll.
**Bclymer**: We'll send it all out tomorrow.
**Kevin.ly**: And then if the fire alarm scope that was noted there is the relay connection for the Skypods.
**Kevin.ly**: I spoke with Brandon on this one.
**Kevin.ly**: He told me, like that's typical, that he knows that the Skypod always has a relay to the fire alarm.
**Kevin.ly**: So that was always.
**Kevin.ly**: That was discussed between Brandon and myself on that one.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: So this is the option B where we are getting the new transformers.
**Mparsons**: Yeah, we already talked about, but we're going to have to upgrade some of the feeders to go with the 112 transformers.
**Cheryl.green**: What are the 400amp feeders for though?
**Mparsons**: That.
**Mparsons**: Yeah, that is to go with size transformers.
**Cheryl.green**: 112.5 KVA transformers should be 175amps, not 400.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Cheryl.green**: I think that was on the.
**Cheryl.green**: What, the updated one line that we sent you guys.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: We'll get with Demo Net.
**Mparsons**: Okay, so these lines we already talked about from the other lines.
**Mparsons**: So we'll look into all of that and mark them up.
**Bclymer**: All right, so yeah, we'll get these all clarified and back to everyone tomorrow.
**Kevin.ly**: There's.
**Kevin.ly**: There's another attachment on the email Keba where it shows the plumbing piping and the electrical distribution.
**Kevin.ly**: Added oil water separator and added outlets per revised drawings.
**Bclymer**: Those were things that were added on the permit set after, you know, we'd done our pricing.
**Bclymer**: And then they added the oil water separator, and then they.
**Bclymer**: We had some.
**Bclymer**: Well, we'll send the drawings along with that too.
**Bclymer**: Where they added some outlets was in that time frame between final pricing and the permit drawings.
**Kevin.ly**: Brian, did we receive the oil separator information after we went out the permit.
**Cheryl.green**: I'm looking for that right now.
**Bclymer**: Well, no, it was with the permit drawings.
**Bclymer**: What I'm saying is we did it and then.
**Kevin.ly**: Oh, the bid set.
**Bclymer**: Those changes from the bid set to the permit set.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And the permits that, you know, the added outlets.
**Bclymer**: I just recall it was something.
**Bclymer**: It was like a plan that was marked up like in that same time frame.
**Bclymer**: Now, I don't know if maybe we got to check too, on, you know, those added data outlets and make sure that this isn't the same thing too.
**Bclymer**: That's why we're going to mark a set of drawings up and then we'll have it all cleared.
**Kevin.ly**: Existing sanitary pipe, sewage, ejector field verified, exact piping location, GPN pump.
**Kevin.ly**: The.
**Cheryl.green**: The oil water separator was added after the bid set, but I don't see any outlets that were added between the bid, the final bid set and the outer permit set.
**Bclymer**: So, I'm sorry, I think those extra.
**Bryan.wagar**: Outlets were captured in the initial bid.
**Bclymer**: Right, Ahmed?
**Kevin.ly**: They were in the bid documents.
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah.
**Kevin.ly**: So like in the Excel sheet that we circulated to all contractors that included, I believe.
**Kevin.ly**: Let me open it up.
**Kevin.ly**: I think it was like 18.
**Kevin.ly**: 18 outlets.
**Kevin.ly**: We knew where we were planning for the desks, but we just did not know where we're planning for the printers.
**Kevin.ly**: And that came a little late from Uniqlo.
**Kevin.ly**: Where did we do this GC bidding?
**Kevin.ly**: Projector, Ahmed.
**Bryan.wagar**: I also think we had extra outlets during the bid set.
**Bryan.wagar**: We had extra outlets at the desks and that permit, those were taken off.
**Bryan.wagar**: So I think those extra outlets were included in the initial bid.
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah, no, I understand.
**Kevin.ly**: But then we relocated some of them because we wanted.
**Kevin.ly**: John Mid wanted to save on putting too many outlets by each workstation because the plan was to put the printers there, but then eventually we started splitting the printers.
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah.
**Kevin.ly**: So I see here it shows general conditions, plumbing, electrical.
**Kevin.ly**: We got Furnish and install 16 quad drops with so core drops at workstations.
**Kevin.ly**: So the change order should really just reflect relocating them.
**Kevin.ly**: And then we downsize them from quads to duplexes in the addendum.
**Kevin.ly**: So should be a little bit of a net before we make an order on that.
**Bclymer**: Like I said, we'll get.
**Bclymer**: We just need to mark up the drawings we had, the information we had, and then we'll get all these things sent back to everybody tomorrow.
**Kevin.ly**: I don't have anything else to really bring up right now.
**Kevin.ly**: Joe Keba, Jesse, Brian, floor is yours.
**Kevin.ly**: Really, if you guys have anything you want to bring up.
**Bclymer**: I can't think of anything.
**Bclymer**: I don't think we had any other issues.
**Bclymer**: We have any open submittals or anything like that?
**Bclymer**: Are we all good on that?
**Mparsons**: Ahmed?
**Mparsons**: I sent you one submittal package yesterday that your spanoff.
**Mparsons**: I think Anderson authorities approved.
**Kevin.ly**: The fires.
**Kevin.ly**: Are you talking about the fire sprinkler one?
**Mparsons**: Correct.
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah, that one is.
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah, that one was uploaded on Job Planner yesterday.
**Mparsons**: Oh, you did?
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah, yeah.
**Mparsons**: All right.
**Mparsons**: So as soon as we, you know, we are going to send back all of the markers and change orders and as soon as we have an idea which direction we are going, we can re update the submittals for the electrical and we will send that back out and move on from there.
**Kevin.ly**: And Kevin, just don't forget to send out that email with what transformers we purchased and we have currently in stock.
**Mparsons**: Yeah, yeah.
**Kevin.ly**: All right.
**Kevin.ly**: And hopefully we'll have a direction by July 16th.
**Kevin.ly**: Fingers crossed.
**Kevin.ly**: And I think we're good.
**Bclymer**: Well, I'm actually a unbox flap guy, so hopefully it goes that way.
**Jdawson**: Appreciate it, Justin.
**Bclymer**: All right, you all have a good one.
**Jdawson**: Thank you.
**Bclymer**: Thanks, everybody.
**Kevin.ly**: Take care.
**Mparsons**: Thank you.
**Jdawson**: Good night.
**Aelkarrimy**: Thank you.
