**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**Fnjie**: But next time please, whenever you upload it, please tag us like whatever, whoever in the smartshoot please tag us to so that we can get notified.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Justin**: So you don't get notified when you just upload.
**Fnjie**: No, otherwise we wouldn't know that something is uploaded to the smartsheet.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Justin**: I think I commented.
**Justin**: I responded in a comment, but I didn't tag anybody.
**Fnjie**: Yeah, yeah, you have to tag.
**Justin**: I have to tag.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: Yeah.
**Justin**: Okay, good to know.
**Justin**: Yeah, because I updated it.
**Justin**: I uploaded all yesterday.
**Justin**: That's why when I saw the email it's like, wait a minute, I sent it.
**Fnjie**: Yeah, because we come up with those open Items around like 3:30 and then we had the team discussions and then right after that we just send those items right away.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: Yeah, that's why.
**Justin**: Yeah, that's why.
**Justin**: Yeah, yeah, I think it was around 5:00.
**Justin**: Yeah, it was right around that time that I sent it.
**Asupit**: Yeah, yeah.
**Asupit**: Hey, can you guys hear me?
**Fnjie**: I just.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Kjin**: How you guys doing?
**Fnjie**: Good, good.
**Fnjie**: How are you?
**Kjin**: Good.
**Justin**: How are you?
**Asupit**: Hello everybody.
**Bclymer**: Hello.
**Asupit**: All right, are we waiting for anybody?
**Asupit**: Is Brandon Joy?
**Mcalcetero**: He has to join.
**Mcalcetero**: I'll text him.
**Asupit**: There we go.
**Asupit**: Excellent.
**Asupit**: Hi Brandon.
**Bclymer**: Welcome.
**Bclymer**: What's up?
**Asupit**: All right, so let's.
**Asupit**: Let's go through or.
**Asupit**: Fatima, Justin, or do you wanted to talk about something specific before we go through the open items that we sent yesterday?
**Asupit**: We can do that first.
**Kjin**: I don't have anything specific.
**Justin**: Yeah, I don't either.
**Justin**: We can just go through the list and address them.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Asupit**: All right, let's go through the open items and knock them out.
**Fnjie**: Yeah.
**Fnjie**: Let me share my screen.
**Fnjie**: Yes, the first one is 2023 bank record.
**Fnjie**: Fatima, we do receive.
**Fnjie**: We do receive your response on the 2023 bank recon yesterday.
**Fnjie**: But I guess the reconciliation is the between book balance and then the state bank statement balance and then we do expect to see the variance of that between those two documents.
**Fnjie**: Supposed to be like around 50k.
**Fnjie**: I don't remember exact variance but it's supposed to be 50k.
**Fnjie**: And then we do.
**Fnjie**: We should the detailed listings that makes that cause that variance.
**Fnjie**: But yeah, in your provided wallpaper we couldn't locate those variants.
**Fnjie**: So could you, could you please double confirm?
**Justin**: Yeah, I.
**Justin**: I'm looking at the reconciliation again.
**Justin**: So I'll send you an update on that.
**Fnjie**: Yeah, I remember you start you Started with the balance from the bank statements, but we didn't see that.
**Fnjie**: How did it.
**Fnjie**: How do.
**Fnjie**: How do we get to the book balance from the bank statement balance?
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Justin**: Yeah, I'll look at that.
**Justin**: The report I updated, I believe was the reconciliation report from the accounting system.
**Justin**: But yeah, I was looking at it.
**Justin**: I'll send you an update.
**Fnjie**: Yes.
**Asupit**: So Kevin, to summarize what you're saying, you're not able to see the outstanding checks and the DIT in the reconciliation.
**Asupit**: Is that right?
**Fnjie**: Yeah, we.
**Fnjie**: We do have this outstanding check and DIT in the recon.
**Fnjie**: In the recon work paper.
**Fnjie**: But I don't see how they get to the.
**Fnjie**: Their book balance.
**Justin**: It seems like it's not.
**Justin**: Not tying out.
**Justin**: I'm not.
**Justin**: I'm not sure what happened with the reconciliation.
**Justin**: They were able to reach the book.
**Justin**: I mean the bank balance.
**Justin**: But for some reason the outstanding checks.
**Justin**: Checks that were outstanding at the time, when you deduct those, it doesn't.
**Justin**: It doesn't tie to the book.
**Justin**: Book balance.
**Fnjie**: Yeah.
**Fnjie**: And then the variance is over our trivial.
**Fnjie**: That's why we.
**Fnjie**: We are following up with the.
**Fnjie**: Fatima.
**Kjin**: So I guess the question is the amount is 59,000.
**Kjin**: I know you're per book balance is 255k but what we receive in the confirmation is 315k.
**Kjin**: So basically what you're reporting is lower in your book.
**Kjin**: In an audit standpoint, 59K.
**Kjin**: We're thinking it's basically an outstanding check.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Kjin**: I think that's just the confirmation to see if it's really a sounding check.
**Kjin**: And it's only 59k because you're.
**Kjin**: We already confirmed 315,000 and your book balance is 255.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Kjin**: So just really.
**Kjin**: Just letting us.
**Kjin**: Letting us know that.
**Kjin**: Okay.
**Kjin**: It is just an outstanding check.
**Justin**: It is outstanding checks.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Kjin**: Yeah.
**Kjin**: So it's not a big item point from our perspective, I believe because we already had a confirmation.
**Kjin**: That's 315 and your book balance is 255,000.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Kjin**: So just confirm to us that it's an outstanding check and then we can move forward.
**Evliao**: Outstanding check.
**Asupit**: So you said 315 and 255 is.
**Asupit**: Is the.
**Asupit**: So 60k is.
**Asupit**: That's what we're talking about.
**Kjin**: Yep.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Justin**: It's about 59.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Asupit**: Yeah.
**Asupit**: I mean Fatima, if you can figure it out in 5 minutes, great.
**Asupit**: If not MGO.
**Asupit**: We can pass on that.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Justin**: I mean there.
**Justin**: There are outstanding checks, but I.
**Justin**: I have to look at.
**Justin**: If you guys want me to give you exactly what Checks are outstanding.
**Justin**: That amount.
**Justin**: That equal to that amount, then I have to spend more time looking at it.
**Justin**: But yeah, they are outstanding checks.
**Asupit**: Five minutes.
**Asupit**: If we can't figure out five minutes, M.G.
**Asupit**: i'll put a pje in the rep letter.
**Bclymer**: Sure.
**Evliao**: What's a pje mean?
**Asupit**: Past Journal entry.
**Asupit**: Meaning it was not small that we can completely pass on it in the sense that we don't bring it to your attention, but we pass on it by bringing it to your attention.
**Asupit**: Gotcha.
**Justin**: I looked at all these things, so will it be easier if I just go through because I have my notes on each item.
**Justin**: Would that be easier?
**Asupit**: Yes.
**Fnjie**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Kjin**: Yeah.
**Justin**: All right.
**Justin**: So for the WIP schedule, I uploaded that yesterday.
**Justin**: Well, Kevin let me know that I have to tag you guys for you to see it.
**Justin**: So, you know, my bad.
**Justin**: I thought I made a comment, but clearly it didn't notify anybody.
**Justin**: So the WIP schedule is in there.
**Justin**: The PPE roll forward is already.
**Justin**: Is also in there.
**Justin**: I updated the schedule.
**Justin**: I uploaded a schedule.
**Justin**: Let me know if I'm missing anything.
**Fnjie**: Fatima, did you uploaded the adjustment for draft entry?
**Justin**: I didn't upload the adjusting entry, but I did adjust it.
**Justin**: I can pull the adjusting entry and upload it.
**Fnjie**: Yeah, because we need to post that entries on our end to be on the same page.
**Fnjie**: To be the same.
**Evliao**: Hey, guys.
**Evliao**: Hey.
**Evliao**: Real quick.
**Evliao**: Do you need anything from me?
**Asupit**: Maybe not.
**Evliao**: If so, let's shift to that because I got other meetings and stuff.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Justin**: I.
**Justin**: I think the only thing they would need from you is the cash entry, the approval for the 155k.
**Asupit**: Okay.
**Justin**: For the Capital One Capital One payment.
**Justin**: They're looking for your approval and we don't have a written approval.
**Evliao**: So how you're saying like how do we approve.
**Evliao**: Like how do I approve the payments?
**Asupit**: Not how, but if you have anything that you documented when you paid the credit card.
**Evliao**: It's just.
**Evliao**: I mean, I can get on Capital One.
**Evliao**: It's just automatically.
**Evliao**: I just go in there and pay it.
**Evliao**: Does it every month.
**Asupit**: Yeah.
**Asupit**: So there's nothing.
**Asupit**: There's nothing there.
**Asupit**: Mgo, he's the one who has full access to that account.
**Evliao**: Yeah, I'm.
**Evliao**: I'm the only one that has access to it.
**Evliao**: Everybody else, like, they can just download statements.
**Evliao**: I'm the only one that can actually do anything.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Asupit**: All right.
**Asupit**: So I just.
**Kjin**: I just.
**Evliao**: I just go in there and it's on automatic payment and.
**Evliao**: Or sometimes I'll do a.
**Evliao**: If it's high like that, I'll do.
**Asupit**: A payment intermittently Is that what you're looking for, Kevin?
**Fnjie**: Yes.
**Fnjie**: For the cash disbursement?
**Fnjie**: Yes.
**Asupit**: Okay.
**Evliao**: And that goes with any and all credit cards?
**Evliao**: Like, every check is signed by me.
**Evliao**: All credit cards are paid.
**Evliao**: I'm the only one that has access to bank any money.
**Asupit**: Yeah, right.
**Fnjie**: We were just documented.
**Fnjie**: Yep.
**Asupit**: What else do we need from Brandon?
**Evliao**: I gotta call this guy back.
**Evliao**: Thanks.
**Asupit**: Okay.
**Asupit**: Thanks, Brent.
**Fnjie**: Thank you.
**Justin**: Okay, we can go back to the top.
**Justin**: Yeah, I'll.
**Justin**: I'll book.
**Justin**: I'll send you the adjusting entries.
**Justin**: Or if you'd like, I can also upload the updated 2023, you know, trial balance.
**Justin**: I can do both.
**Fnjie**: So do we only have the adjustment for the PPE for the 2023 balance or.
**Fnjie**: You adjusted the balance for a couple of GL accounts for 2023.
**Justin**: I adjusted the balance for the PPE and I also adjusted the cost.
**Fnjie**: Adjusted the cost?
**Justin**: Yeah, the cost for, you know, some of the WIP items.
**Fnjie**: Oh.
**Fnjie**: So if that is the case, it's better for us to receive the updated TB for 2023.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: And then we start from there.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Justin**: I may have updated it already.
**Justin**: I'll double check and send you a note.
**Fnjie**: We received trial balance for 2024 twice.
**Fnjie**: I guess that's why you probably didn't upload the 2023 TV.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: Yeah.
**Asupit**: Yeah.
**Asupit**: 2023 absolutely should have changed because of all the WIP stuff and depreciation and all that stuff.
**Fnjie**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Justin**: Since we have so many files in there, would it be easier if I just email it to you or just.
**Justin**: Just drop it in there?
**Fnjie**: We'd like to track our status through the smartsheet, so it's better for us to receive through the smartsheet.
**Asupit**: Thank you, Fatima.
**Asupit**: You can always delete what's old if you think it's not useful.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Justin**: So those for the selections.
**Justin**: Yes, selections.
**Justin**: Those were imported into the accounting system from Procore in the first one was imported in January 2024.
**Justin**: And the date that the subcontractor and the project manager have there is January 2024.
**Justin**: But when I look back at the invoice, it does say that it does have a December.
**Justin**: December 2023.
**Fnjie**: Oh, sorry.
**Justin**: I think it's actually.
**Justin**: It actually says December 2023.
**Justin**: Yes, and there was an email trail.
**Justin**: They sent the invoice.
**Justin**: I don't know why it never got booked, but it looked like it wasn't recognized until January 2024.
**Justin**: Okay, so the.
**Justin**: To answer your question, the liability was not reported in 2023.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Kjin**: So one thing Is.
**Kjin**: Is this where you guys corrected this already based on your new WIP schedule?
**Justin**: It's probably corrected already, depending on the job.
**Justin**: 24, 104, 4104 was still pending in 2024, so.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Justin**: May have been corrected already.
**Kjin**: So if it was corrected and we can kind of see the proof, this would not be like a selection then.
**Kjin**: Really?
**Kjin**: Just because we have corrected what's called wip schedules.
**Justin**: Yes, 2414 4.
**Asupit**: So I think what Adrian is asking is we got to make sure it's in our 2023 cost.
**Asupit**: Yeah, yeah.
**Asupit**: Either.
**Asupit**: Either as cost on the P.
**Asupit**: L or cost in excess of billings on the balance sheet.
**Asupit**: One way or another, it's in 2023.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Asupit**: I think that's what you're asking, right?
**Kjin**: Yeah, basically.
**Kjin**: And if that's fine, and that's not an.
**Kjin**: Not an error just because we already corrected the.
**Kjin**: The WHIP schedule.
**Kjin**: And how many selections do we have for SFL testing already?
**Kjin**: It should be sufficient enough.
**Kjin**: Right.
**Kjin**: We just remove this as selection then because it's been corrected.
**Fnjie**: Yeah, we can remove it.
**Fnjie**: We didn't run the sampling for the selections.
**Kjin**: That's fine.
**Asupit**: Well, actually, when was it actually paid?
**Asupit**: When did the money go out?
**Asupit**: That's the purpose here.
**Justin**: It went out in January 2024.
**Asupit**: Okay.
**Asupit**: Yeah.
**Asupit**: So MGO, keep it as a selection and show that it was properly accrued in 23.
**Kjin**: In 2023.
**Kjin**: Yeah, that's true.
**Kjin**: We can use that as a selection for our 2023 SFUO testing.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Asupit**: Yep.
**Justin**: Same for the pre.
**Justin**: Same for the next one.
**Kjin**: Okay.
**Kjin**: So we just.
**Kjin**: You just have to provide us the support that it is included now in the cost schedule.
**Bclymer**: Oh.
**Asupit**: When we get the detail of the cost, this selection should be in there.
**Kjin**: It should be, yes.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Asupit**: So that's what we're going to do, Fatima, when we look at the revised WIP and the revised cost, it's obviously going to agree to the GL.
**Asupit**: We're going to make sure these two are in that population of cost for 2023, whatever year we're talking.
**Asupit**: Yeah.
**Asupit**: For the.
**Asupit**: It looks like for the first one for 2023.
**Asupit**: Is the second one related to 24?
**Fnjie**: Yes.
**Asupit**: Yeah.
**Asupit**: So we'd make sure it's in the 24 cost pool.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Justin**: So the only issue I can see is for the accrual of the prior year invoices.
**Justin**: It's a lump sum.
**Justin**: We didn't go back and accrue per invoice, if that makes sense for each job.
**Asupit**: Explain that.
**Asupit**: Sorry.
**Asupit**: One more time.
**Justin**: So if let's say there was cost that needed to be accrued to the.
**Justin**: The prior year.
**Asupit**: Yeah.
**Justin**: It's not going to show the amount per line per invoice.
**Asupit**: Okay, but you.
**Asupit**: You what, you recorded it as like.
**Justin**: A batch, Like a lump sum?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Asupit**: Okay, but the detail behind that lump sum is somewhere.
**Asupit**: Right?
**Asupit**: Like that number came from where the lump sum entry.
**Justin**: The lump sum entry came?
**Justin**: I guess.
**Justin**: Yeah, we can pull it.
**Justin**: But it might.
**Justin**: It's going to say 2024.
**Justin**: It's going to say the current year.
**Asupit**: It says 2024.
**Asupit**: But in actuality, you recorded it in 23.
**Asupit**: Right.
**Justin**: The invoice said 2023, but it got recorded in 2024.
**Asupit**: Okay.
**Asupit**: So we didn't go back in and true it up for 23.
**Justin**: So that's what I'm saying.
**Justin**: When I did the WIP adjustment, I didn't go back and accrue invoice by invoice because there was a lot of things that needed to be moved.
**Justin**: So the evidence of what makes up the lump sum, we have that, but the backup will say the month it was booked in, not what it got accrued in.
**Kjin**: Oh, okay.
**Kjin**: So the system, you saw the detail and then you just posted the.
**Kjin**: Is there any backup or any proof of that that will tie up to that lump sum?
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Kjin**: And then that will then trace to this invoice?
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Asupit**: Okay, let's just take.
**Asupit**: Let's just take the first one as an example.
**Asupit**: 16,000.
**Asupit**: Right.
**Asupit**: That clearly was related to 2023.
**Asupit**: Correct.
**Asupit**: It was recorded in 24, but it was.
**Asupit**: It was.
**Asupit**: It's related in 23.
**Asupit**: Correct.
**Justin**: Based on the.
**Justin**: Based on the invoice.
**Justin**: Yes.
**Justin**: So.
**Justin**: And.
**Justin**: And a lot of times what happens with these subs is they can invoice for an amount and date the amount, date the invoice, like 2023 or.
**Justin**: Oh, whatever month they invoiced it.
**Justin**: But if the PM feels like this work was completed in another month, then they'll pay it in that month.
**Justin**: So this may be a situation where I go back and confirm with the pm, but based on what I'm seeing in the system, the invoice said 2023, but it was processed and paid in 2024.
**Asupit**: Okay, very, very good.
**Asupit**: But for purposes of the WIP schedule and the cost, this should have been in.
**Asupit**: It should have been recorded in 20.
**Asupit**: It was paid in 24, but it should have been recorded in 23.
**Asupit**: Was that the case or no?
**Asupit**: What was that?
**Asupit**: Sorry?
**Justin**: Based on the invoice.
**Justin**: Yes.
**Asupit**: Okay.
**Kjin**: I think what she's Saying is that some.
**Kjin**: Some instances is where the PM would think they might have invoiced it in 2023, but the actual service or cost is 2024.
**Kjin**: Is that what you're trying to say, Fatima?
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Justin**: I will have to go back to the project manager and confirm.
**Justin**: Did they do this work in 2023 or 2024?
**Justin**: Because I don't have that detail.
**Justin**: I'm not sure.
**Justin**: But based on the invoice, the Invoice was dated 2023.
**Kjin**: So Kevin was in the services.
**Kjin**: Was there any kind of like services or any detail that says work done in 2023 or work done in 2024?
**Fnjie**: In the invoice it shows the period and then the period states that that is the period for the December 2023.
**Fnjie**: Let me double check.
**Fnjie**: We do have the invoice here.
**Justin**: Yeah, this one actually says January 2023, but it was paid in January 2024.
**Asupit**: A year later.
**Justin**: A year later.
**Kjin**: Sales order date 1 6, 2023.
**Kjin**: So that's a sales order date, customer PO date.
**Kjin**: So that's PO.
**Kjin**: So we don't know when the work is done.
**Kjin**: Scroll down invoice for work complete.
**Asupit**: I mean, we've got.
**Asupit**: So.
**Asupit**: So one thing at a time.
**Asupit**: So one for sure.
**Asupit**: This is a 2023 transaction, correct now?
**Asupit**: Correct.
**Asupit**: 2023.
**Asupit**: Clearly it says.
**Justin**: Yeah, it says 20 2023.
**Asupit**: Okay.
**Asupit**: So for 2023, from a whip schedule perspective, it was E.
**Asupit**: It should either be an asset under cost and excess of billings or it should be in cost on the P and L.
**Kjin**: Yeah, scroll down more.
**Asupit**: I still don't see the 16,000 Kevin is in.
**Fnjie**: Oh, if we.
**Fnjie**: Yeah, there's a 13 and then there's a combination of.
**Asupit**: Yeah, okay.
**Asupit**: And then this one is also.
**Asupit**: Yeah, 2023.
**Kjin**: January 2020.
**Asupit**: So I know it was paid in 24.
**Asupit**: So under.
**Asupit**: So from an accrual perspective, I'm not too concerned right now about when it was paid, but I need to make sure it's somewhere in 2023, either on the asset or it's in cost on the piano.
**Asupit**: So that's what we're going to be doing is we're going to looking at 2023 and making sure that is complete and making our selections from there.
**Asupit**: And that's why we're like, okay, yeah, we got a Siemens invoice.
**Asupit**: So we've already got one selection, which is great.
**Asupit**: That's if it's in 2023 already, that makes sense.
**Asupit**: Medina.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Asupit**: Okay, so from what you've done from a WIPs standpoint, is this to be found in 2023 somewhere?
**Justin**: I think so, yes.
**Justin**: I have to double check.
**Asupit**: Okay, so MGO team, when we request the cost detail.
**Asupit**: You guys with me.
**Asupit**: When you request their cost detail for 23, whether it's the cost per the P L or cost on the asset side of the balance sheet, we have to see this in that detail.
**Asupit**: And then, yes, it will be part of our selection, which we've already tested.
**Asupit**: So we already got one out of the way, but it has to be in 2023.
**Fnjie**: Yeah.
**Kjin**: So one thing is, we're not testing 2023 in detail, so we just have to see that it's included in the system.
**Asupit**: Right, but if it's on the balance sheet in 2023, that's part of our scope opening check.
**Kjin**: Because I don't think there's a significant contract asset account from last year.
**Asupit**: Oh, I don't know what it is.
**Kjin**: Yeah, it's zero.
**Kjin**: Cost in excess of billings is zero.
**Kjin**: So the question is, should this be part.
**Kjin**: Should we have a cost in excess of billings?
**Asupit**: Hold up one second.
**Asupit**: We have zero cost cost asset in 2023.
**Justin**: No, for the old trial balance.
**Justin**: We do.
**Justin**: I haven't updated the new trial balance yet.
**Asupit**: Oh, yeah, I was gonna.
**Asupit**: Yes, I was gonna say new trial balance.
**Asupit**: We absolutely should.
**Asupit**: So fatigue is going to be uploading that a little later, it sounds like too.
**Kjin**: Yeah.
**Kjin**: So then we should be able to trace it to there or the population of a cost of a contract, which we're not testing, but we just had to make sure that it's included in 2023 in that cost contract.
**Asupit**: That's right.
**Asupit**: Yeah.
**Asupit**: 2023 should absolutely have that asset on the books now.
**Asupit**: And once you request the detail, ngo, we should see even.
**Asupit**: We'll get the detail.
**Asupit**: There's probably going to be a lump sum entry.
**Asupit**: Then we get the lump sum entry detail.
**Asupit**: So, Fatima, I don't know if there's a way to do that for us.
**Asupit**: If not, we'll just have to point it out and you can.
**Asupit**: We can request it separately.
**Asupit**: Okay, well, we'll need to go down to the transaction level, the invoice level, for our selections.
**Asupit**: Okay, so if we see a lump sum entry, that's fine, but we need to get the detail behind that in order to make selections from that underlying detail.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Asupit**: Okay, now this is good because this is.
**Asupit**: This is exactly what we're going to be doing when we're testing the wiper reporter.
**Asupit**: All right, what else?
**Fnjie**: And then the next.
**Fnjie**: The second sample from the SFOL which is for 2024.
**Fnjie**: We will request the job cost details to see if this one is properly recorded under the cost of 2024.
**Asupit**: Same.
**Asupit**: Same logic.
**Asupit**: Right?
**Justin**: Same thing.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Asupit**: Yep.
**Asupit**: What else we got?
**Fnjie**: Yeah, equity.
**Fnjie**: Yeah.
**Fnjie**: Just want to know the nature of this account.
**Fnjie**: 1810.
**Fnjie**: We booked it under the asset shareholder receivable.
**Fnjie**: We have zero balance, but in the prior year we have 220.
**Fnjie**: I'm not sure if this number balance is updated from your updated 2023 TV.
**Justin**: Yes, it is.
**Justin**: It's now zero.
**Fnjie**: It's now.
**Fnjie**: It's all zero.
**Fnjie**: Right?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Kjin**: Where'd you move that actually?
**Kjin**: What was it?
**Justin**: We recorded it as an.
**Justin**: As an expense because they were all expenses that got booked in there.
**Kjin**: Oh, okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Kjin**: So there was no, I guess, distributions from.
**Fnjie**: Brandon in 2024.
**Fnjie**: We have.
**Justin**: They have, yeah.
**Justin**: In 2024.
**Kjin**: I just want to make sure that's not like a distribution from him then from.
**Kjin**: In 2023.
**Kjin**: 2023.
**Fnjie**: Fatima, could you clarify?
**Fnjie**: We don't have the distribution during the 2023.
**Justin**: No.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Justin**: I don't.
**Justin**: I didn't see any.
**Justin**: Any in there.
**Justin**: They were all expenses.
**Justin**: And I believe we discussed this in the last meeting, right?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Asupit**: I'm sorry, say that last part again, Fatima.
**Justin**: No, I.
**Justin**: I believe we went.
**Justin**: Went through the detail of that share shareholder account and there was no, there were no distributions in there.
**Justin**: They were all expenses.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Kjin**: Okay, so I guess we can remove that and then we just have to import the new last prior year.
**Fnjie**: Yeah.
**Asupit**: As expected.
**Asupit**: Very good.
**Fnjie**: Yeah.
**Fnjie**: And then the revenue.
**Fnjie**: Yeah, we do receive the.
**Fnjie**: And then.
**Fnjie**: Yeah, so expense.
**Fnjie**: So we have the zero balance under the shop supplies while we have the 88,000 under 2023.
**Fnjie**: So this question arise from our flux analysis.
**Fnjie**: And then Fatima, I remember you said we need to figure out where we book this shop supplies in 2024.
**Justin**: Shop supplies.
**Fnjie**: Yeah.
**Fnjie**: So I can show you our trial balance.
**Fnjie**: So this is the one in the prior year.
**Fnjie**: We have 89, almost 90k.
**Fnjie**: But we have the 0 balance for 24.
**Asupit**: I think they said they started to code those to jobs.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Asupit**: So that's why.
**Asupit**: And we're not concerned about two jobs.
**Asupit**: Yeah, for 23, we're not concerned about the P.
**Asupit**: L.
**Asupit**: It's all flushed through.
**Asupit**: So that, that would be the explanation.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: As well as those travel expenses.
**Fnjie**: Right.
**Fnjie**: Because I remember they.
**Fnjie**: Those travel expenses they coded to the cost each job.
**Fnjie**: That's why we have significant decrease in the 2024.
**Fnjie**: I guess.
**Kjin**: Didn't Brandon have like an explanation a little bit on that one maybe they didn't do much.
**Kjin**: His travel.
**Asupit**: Yeah, I think his travel was related to like BD stuff.
**Asupit**: Administrative stuff.
**Asupit**: That's why you see Travel 309 4K.
**Asupit**: Is that your question?
**Fnjie**: No.
**Fnjie**: We know the travel expense is allocated to the each job.
**Fnjie**: So I just want to know if just this shop supplies we have the same situations.
**Asupit**: Okay.
**Asupit**: Shop supplies for 2024 has been coded the jobs.
**Asupit**: That's why this year.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: Yep.
**Fnjie**: You can just document it.
**Asupit**: And then depreciation should have changed.
**Asupit**: And they updated fixed assets.
**Fnjie**: Yes.
**Asupit**: And then the 155 we talked about, right?
**Fnjie**: Yes, just a document.
**Fnjie**: And then.
**Fnjie**: So this is the supporting documents request for our cache Resist walkthrough.
**Fnjie**: Fatima.
**Fnjie**: Yeah.
**Fnjie**: We requested the backups for our samples.
**Justin**: I uploaded those.
**Fnjie**: Yeah.
**Fnjie**: And then.
**Fnjie**: So I remember you uploaded the invoice.
**Fnjie**: Right.
**Fnjie**: And then I don't see any like approval procedures in the supporting documents.
**Fnjie**: So I guess I since they have.
**Fnjie**: There's only like Brandon have the access to all the bank accounts.
**Fnjie**: And then we can just documented this as well.
**Asupit**: This is for money coming in, right?
**Justin**: This.
**Justin**: This was an AR invoice.
**Justin**: Invoices issued, you know, the customer.
**Justin**: Customer pays it.
**Fnjie**: Yeah.
**Justin**: And I show where the money came into the bank account.
**Justin**: I attached the invoice.
**Justin**: I showed.
**Justin**: Showed the money deposited on the statement.
**Kjin**: And is this through check or is it through wire?
**Kjin**: Why is it through wire?
**Justin**: It was a wire.
**Kjin**: Yeah, yeah, that's.
**Kjin**: That's fine.
**Kjin**: It's probably through their system, right?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Kjin**: Set up the.
**Kjin**: And it's money coming in.
**Kjin**: So we know who the customer is.
**Kjin**: I guess based on the system construction, Excel, center, school.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Kjin**: Okay.
**Kjin**: And the idea is, is that who does the AR changes reduction and then the journal entries afterwards for the cash receipts.
**Justin**: The idea is what.
**Justin**: Do you mind.
**Justin**: Do you mind repeating that again?
**Kjin**: Who books the journal entries for reducing the ar?
**Justin**: The accountant does.
**Justin**: So once we receive the payment, they enter the cash receipts into the system.
**Kjin**: Okay.
**Kjin**: Yeah.
**Kjin**: It's like a daily process that you guys do this.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Justin**: Whenever money is received.
**Kjin**: Okay.
**Speaker 7**: Yeah.
**Kjin**: And when you say accountant, is it the Philippines?
**Kjin**: The Philip.
**Justin**: Yes.
**Kjin**: Okay.
**Kjin**: So Philippines have access to only read access to the only read access.
**Kjin**: Yeah.
**Kjin**: And they see it probably every day.
**Kjin**: They see like a receipt comes through and they just book it into the system.
**Kjin**: They.
**Kjin**: How do they identify the specific client by just the.
**Kjin**: I'm sure it's through that.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Justin**: Usually it will say.
**Justin**: Or sometimes if you see a deposit come in, you know, they might break it up.
**Justin**: But if you add it up, it'll match an expected receipt.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Justin**: And Normally the.
**Justin**: The PMs will say, hey, we are expecting this amount from this job.
**Justin**: And then we'll just be.
**Justin**: Or they'll just be on the lookout for it.
**Kjin**: Okay.
**Kjin**: And they posted in.
**Kjin**: Sorry, what Was the accounting system?
**Justin**: Acumatica.
**Kjin**: Acumatica, yes.
**Kjin**: And then procord.
**Kjin**: Is it automatic?
**Justin**: It's what?
**Kjin**: Automatic, like the payments and the billings.
**Kjin**: And once this gets paid.
**Justin**: It does, yeah.
**Justin**: Once it gets paid, the information is synced back back to procore, showing it.
**Asupit**: Okay.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Justin**: If it's not, we manually.
**Justin**: There's been times where we've had sync issues, so we manually go into procore and market as paid with the payment information.
**Kjin**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: Yep.
**Fnjie**: And then.
**Fnjie**: So we decided to perform the payroll walkthrough since we are not able to obtain the second report for the payroll provider.
**Fnjie**: Yes.
**Fnjie**: Well, Adrian, do you want to set up a separate meeting with the Brandon to go through payroll walkthroughs?
**Fnjie**: Or maybe we can do it with Fatima.
**Kjin**: Do we have a narrative of the payroll process?
**Fnjie**: We do have, but it's a simple paragraph.
**Kjin**: Okay, open that up.
**Kjin**: Let's see what that looks like.
**Kjin**: So then it's possible we might just do the walkthrough tomorrow.
**Fnjie**: This one.
**Kjin**: But now we can just kind of talk about what we need to kind of look at.
**Asupit**: And what we need.
**Asupit**: What's our selection for.
**Asupit**: For this.
**Kjin**: So the question is, in audit procedures, would you want to do a sampling calculator or would just a walkthrough be sufficient?
**Kjin**: And then do a.
**Kjin**: What's called a payroll reconciliation?
**Asupit**: Yeah, the reconciliation will be sufficient for the 941s, but, yeah, we'll look.
**Asupit**: What I want to do is just because they don't have a SOC report, pick a couple that we get their.
**Asupit**: Say, their offer letters for.
**Kjin**: I was thinking of doing one payroll register and one hiring and one termination.
**Kjin**: Would that be.
**Kjin**: Or would you want.
**Asupit**: Okay, perfect.
**Kjin**: And that's what we're gonna do in the walkthrough.
**Kjin**: And then we can kind of punt it to.
**Asupit**: That's more than enough.
**Asupit**: So.
**Asupit**: So what.
**Asupit**: What the walkthrough will cover is basically something that shows Brandon has approved that payroll for that period.
**Asupit**: I don't know, Maria.
**Asupit**: Does he have anything that he physically says, okay, I've approved payroll for this month or these days.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, so we have a lot of different approved.
**Mcalcetero**: You know, like a different.
**Mcalcetero**: Every time they send us something, we approve the payroll.
**Mcalcetero**: So I asked the company, you know, I was talking to, and they said they can do it.
**Mcalcetero**: But it's going to take a long time.
**Mcalcetero**: And since you said you, you were right, it's a small company so they are not going to do the soccer.
**Mcalcetero**: So we have.
**Mcalcetero**: Every time they send payrolls, we have the approved ones.
**Mcalcetero**: But.
**Mcalcetero**: But the thing is that, the thing is that is an.
**Mcalcetero**: It's another company previously you.
**Mcalcetero**: They're trying to help it.
**Mcalcetero**: But I don't know if I can help you with approval like a, like an entire document or what else.
**Justin**: Yes, I think he is talking about internal approvals.
**Justin**: Right?
**Asupit**: Internal approvals, Maria?
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, I do the approvals.
**Mcalcetero**: I do the approvals for this year.
**Mcalcetero**: The previous one I think is Brandon or I don't know, Fatima, who did the approval.
**Justin**: Yeah, Brandon.
**Justin**: So payroll, the guys enter their time sheets, accounting processes payroll and they send to Brandon to approve.
**Justin**: So yes, there should be approvals.
**Justin**: It might be a team approval saying approved.
**Justin**: You know, payroll is approved.
**Justin**: But yes, yes.
**Kjin**: And it's.
**Kjin**: Is it bi weekly?
**Justin**: Yes, yes.
**Kjin**: So one thing that we're going to do is just randomly select one bi weekly pay register and just do a walkthrough.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Kjin**: And then ultimately I guess we can choose one.
**Asupit**: I think we just go with the.
**Asupit**: I just go.
**Asupit**: We go with the assumption that there's not anything physical showing it because obviously, you know, things are very informal at that time.
**Kjin**: In 2024 though, I think I'm pretty sure there is a pair register that or for them to kind of like accept the payment to go through.
**Kjin**: Because what I'm hearing is Brandon accepts all payments.
**Kjin**: Right.
**Justin**: In 2024, I'm not sure.
**Justin**: I think this current payroll company is more formal than Worksmart was.
**Mcalcetero**: So we can, we can actually check.
**Mcalcetero**: Let me ask Brandon if he has, you know, like approval if he remembers or anything.
**Mcalcetero**: But that's true.
**Mcalcetero**: I mean in the previous year it was very informal.
**Mcalcetero**: Informal.
**Mcalcetero**: This year this part company is more formal and it's more.
**Asupit**: So let me ask Brandon right now.
**Asupit**: 20.
**Asupit**: So we're, we're just concerned with 2024.
**Asupit**: So on the, at the end of the day, MGO get like Adrian said, one payroll register and then get an offer letter for one hire.
**Asupit**: I doubt there's any going to be anything formal on a termination and that's it.
**Asupit**: We're.
**Kjin**: Yeah.
**Kjin**: So just provide us any hiring documentation that you have for one person this year and for terminations.
**Kjin**: Let us know if there's any terminations that happen this year and provide us the.
**Kjin**: Any kind of.
**Asupit**: This year.
**Asupit**: Meaning 2024 this year.
**Justin**: Meaning 24.
**Kjin**: Yes, 2024.
**Kjin**: And then we'll choose a payroll register.
**Asupit**: Maria, do you know what payroll register means?
**Asupit**: Because we've received Excel workshops, we can ask.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, I can always ask the person helping us.
**Mcalcetero**: You know, whatever you guys need, just let me know.
**Asupit**: And then who has access to the.
**Asupit**: Who has access to Work Smart?
**Mcalcetero**: Only Brandon.
**Mcalcetero**: I don't have access to it.
**Asupit**: Oh, okay.
**Mcalcetero**: I only have access to this payroll, not the previous one.
**Mcalcetero**: So Amanda is the person who is helping us with work.
**Mcalcetero**: So everything you want, like, you know, like payroll register, everything, just let me know and I'll ask Amanda.
**Asupit**: Who's Amanda?
**Mcalcetero**: Amanda is a person that is our account manager for Work Smart.
**Asupit**: Oh, okay.
**Mcalcetero**: So that was the one that says if you want to talk to her or another person in terms of, you know.
**Asupit**: Yeah, so we don't need any.
**Asupit**: We don't need the company.
**Asupit**: We don't need Work Smart to give us anything.
**Asupit**: If Brandon still has his login, he should be able to download.
**Asupit**: Download.
**Mcalcetero**: So I just text him and he said, I'm pretty sure I will have delete them.
**Mcalcetero**: I'm sure.
**Mcalcetero**: There was just a button in the portal I click and approved on.
**Mcalcetero**: So probably there's like a history of approvals in the portal.
**Asupit**: Okay.
**Asupit**: I mean, this guy, he's the only one here, guys.
**Asupit**: So there's not like a full system and cycle that they have to go through every two weeks.
**Asupit**: So let's just get what we need from a documentation perspective and go with the.
**Asupit**: Go with the fact that Brandon approved everything and then we're done.
**Kjin**: Yeah, you can just give us any November pay register.
**Kjin**: I think that's fine.
**Mcalcetero**: November.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, Paid register.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay, so it should be like a.
**Asupit**: P.
**Asupit**: It should be like a PDF where it has everybody's salary or everybody's payout.
**Asupit**: For that?
**Kjin**: Yeah, for that.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay, let me text her right now and.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay, I'll just give you.
**Mcalcetero**: I'll just text her.
**Mcalcetero**: But I'm pretty sure it's a history.
**Asupit**: Brandon can get it from Worksmart.
**Asupit**: He can just download it from Worksmart.
**Mcalcetero**: Yes and no, because last time we were trying.
**Mcalcetero**: I was trying to log in with his Worksmart login and it says that he was declined because of unused.
**Mcalcetero**: So Amanda has to set it up again for certain days.
**Mcalcetero**: And then like, you know, she's kind of like.
**Mcalcetero**: How do you say, like, determine helping us on this.
**Mcalcetero**: She's a middleman helping us to get these things.
**Justin**: Let me see what I can find.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, yeah, I remember you also worked on.
**Fnjie**: Yeah, yeah, Then Agent, should you also obtain the.
**Fnjie**: Those snapshot of Those approval page that Brandon made in the, in the payroll provider.
**Fnjie**: No, no, no.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Fnjie**: Yep.
**Fnjie**: That will be all for today.
**Kjin**: So one thing that I want to mention, now that we have the full WIP schedule, and I know that we're trying to clear up all these a little bit easier sections, but the biggest piece is the WIP schedule and the ar.
**Kjin**: Now our next step is once we recalculate the WHIP schedule, tie it to our tv, everything looks good.
**Kjin**: Right.
**Kjin**: We're gonna make selections and then provide you with confirmations for either Brandon or if it's Maria, to sign.
**Kjin**: Pretty sure it's gonna be Brandon.
**Kjin**: And we're going to send it out to the third party.
**Kjin**: It's called Customers.
**Kjin**: We're going to confirm the contract amount, we're going to confirm the billings to date and all that sort of important construction accounting information.
**Kjin**: And then after that, also we're going to make selections within our contract costs.
**Kjin**: So then hopefully we can get those by you today.
**Kjin**: Not only the confirmations for the contracts and the ar, but also our selections for the costs.
**Kjin**: And that's where I think we needed a quick turnaround because for confirmations, we don't know how long it will take for them to respond because we're.
**Asupit**: Brandon is going to be on top of them, so they're going to respond pretty quickly.
**Kjin**: Okay.
**Asupit**: From a confirmation perspective.
**Asupit**: But it's the selections, the invoices and all that that we're going to be looking at that we need.
**Asupit**: Fatima, I mean, if you can do it within 24 hours, that would be appreciated.
**Kjin**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: How.
**Justin**: How many selections are we to.
**Asupit**: Is going to be around 80.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Asupit**: Yeah, let me, let me, let me put a disclaimer on top of that or a caveat based off of the old width.
**Asupit**: So we'll see how it looks like now.
**Asupit**: And maybe, maybe less, maybe more.
**Asupit**: I'm not sure.
**Asupit**: We gotta look at it first.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay, guys, so Brandon, just text me.
**Mcalcetero**: I don't.
**Mcalcetero**: I'm pretty sure there's not, like he said, like a record of the approvals.
**Mcalcetero**: If they need.
**Mcalcetero**: If I need to sign something, if he needs to sign something saying I approve them, we can do that.
**Asupit**: Let's get the November 2024 payroll register and we're done.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Kjin**: And all the other, like, hiring.
**Kjin**: One hiring and one termination for the year, that should be fine.
**Kjin**: All right.
**Kjin**: Yeah, so I think we're progressing.
**Kjin**: We're trying to wrap up all these other sections, but like I said, the biggest one is AR and wip.
**Kjin**: So we're going to proceed with that, providing your selections by today and confirmation so we can send that out as soon as possible.
**Asupit**: Is this the new one right here, Kevin?
**Fnjie**: Yes.
**Fnjie**: Yes, this is a new one.
**Kjin**: I don't think we have.
**Kjin**: Do we have any initial questions for now?
**Kjin**: I think the gross margin seems pretty fine.
**Kjin**: I guess some projects are not doing that well, but we saw that they were pretty close to being completed.
**Kjin**: 90 something percent.
**Fnjie**: Yeah.
**Asupit**: Yeah.
**Asupit**: Crate is the only one we know that was unfortunate and will be a loss.
**Kjin**: Yeah.
**Asupit**: The other one.
**Fnjie**: And then there's one more loss too.
**Kjin**: But not that big.
**Kjin**: So other than that, I think.
**Asupit**: And our, our gross margins in column AE and ak, are they relatively consistent with column U?
**Asupit**: Hopefully.
**Kjin**: Right.
**Kjin**: Seems like what he said was pretty accurate.
**Asupit**: Some of them are exact.
**Asupit**: Wow.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Asupit**: Yeah.
**Asupit**: I mean, from a quick skim through this, it looks a lot better.
**Fnjie**: Yeah.
**Fnjie**: Fatima, I will let you know once we select, once we make a selection for this revenue and then we will go further and move forward and request those job cost details for our selections.
**Fnjie**: And then we will make further selections for those job costs.
**Bclymer**: Okay, sounds good.
**Asupit**: So after, after doing this, Fatima, there's no longer a need for a WIP adjustment, right?
**Justin**: For 2024?
**Justin**: No, no, because I.
**Justin**: I reported the.
**Justin**: The whip adjustment.
**Asupit**: Okay, so.
**Asupit**: So total revenues is 10.5 million on the new trial balance, right?
**Kjin**: Yes, should be.
**Asupit**: And that's it.
**Asupit**: Okay.
**Asupit**: So mgo, go back and check our materiality.
**Asupit**: I don't know what it was when we first did it, but go back and check materiality.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Kjin**: I don't think it.
**Kjin**: I think it's pretty similar, actually.
**Asupit**: You don't need to do it right now.
**Kjin**: You don't want to show it now.
**Kjin**: Yeah.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Kjin**: If anything, if it's not a material change, we don't have.
**Kjin**: We just have to document it.
**Fnjie**: Cool.
**Kjin**: Any other last questions?
**Kjin**: Kevin, from you.
**Fnjie**: Yeah.
**Fnjie**: Asian.
**Fnjie**: I.
**Fnjie**: I remember we wanted to know with the.
**Fnjie**: Fatima, that how they book their over and under and over billings for a journal entry perspective.
**Fnjie**: Because the variant, the difference between over and under, we booked to the revenue.
**Kjin**: There's no variance anymore now it's just.
**Fnjie**: We do have the variance.
**Fnjie**: We do have the variance, but I just want to make sure.
**Fnjie**: When we book the Underbuilding.
**Fnjie**: Right.
**Fnjie**: I guess we should book debit under billing and then the credit revenue.
**Justin**: So we book over.
**Justin**: So it's one.
**Justin**: One general entry and this is not.
**Justin**: Can you look at the original file I uploaded?
**Justin**: It has the general entry right under it.
**Justin**: And it wasn't this.
**Fnjie**: It is no this is.
**Fnjie**: This is the.
**Fnjie**: This is the one created by myself.
**Fnjie**: I just want to make sure if this is the journal entry the company book to record over and under.
**Justin**: Yeah, Let me share my screen real quick.
**Fnjie**: Yep.
**Justin**: So the entry we book depending on, you know, if we need to increase, increase or decrease the asset, we only see your.
**Asupit**: Your team Swatima.
**Asupit**: We don't see.
**Justin**: Oh, I'm sorry.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Justin**: So the entry we book depending on whether we need to increase or decrease the asset will just be one.
**Justin**: One general entry.
**Justin**: So prior to this final adjustment, the asset was 938,000.
**Justin**: We need to increase it to 1.4 million.
**Justin**: So we debited the asset.
**Justin**: We needed to.
**Justin**: To decrease the liability.
**Justin**: So we debited the liability and the different.
**Justin**: We booked to a WIP adjustment, gl, which is under revenue.
**Kjin**: So it's a.
**Kjin**: You do book it on revenue.
**Kjin**: So revenues, it's 10 million plus a plus another account of 536.
**Kjin**: Right?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Justin**: Revenue was.
**Kjin**: 10 million.
**Justin**: Revenue was 9.
**Justin**: 9.
**Justin**: 9.2 million.
**Justin**: And the overall whip adjustment is the sum of these two.
**Justin**: We had already booked this, so we just booked an extra amount to make it equal.
**Justin**: So these two, plus the nine million that was actually nine millions in AR makes up the 10.5 million.
**Kjin**: 4900.
**Asupit**: So.
**Asupit**: So revenue is 10.5 plus the WIP adjustment.
**Asupit**: No revenue includes the WIP adjustment.
**Justin**: Includes the WIP adjustment.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Kjin**: Oh, okay.
**Justin**: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Justin**: The AR invoices win.
**Asupit**: Right?
**Bclymer**: Excellent.
**Justin**: 9.2 million if you add the whip adjustment.
**Justin**: We've made several adjustments to get to this, you know, to get the whip.
**Justin**: Right.
**Justin**: If you add the, you know, the total whip adjustment to the.
**Justin**: To the 9.2 million, it gives you the earned revenue of 10.5.
**Kjin**: Okay.
**Asupit**: Yep.
**Kjin**: Okay, that makes.
**Kjin**: Yeah, that makes sense.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Justin**: So I guess, Kevin, to answer your question, we can book the over, you know, over villains and under villains, you know, like, separately, but it'll be.
**Asupit**: And Brandon reviewed this, right?
**Justin**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Asupit**: And then.
**Asupit**: All right, so the column W and X are 2024 assets and liabilities.
**Asupit**: What about 23?
**Asupit**: Do we have 23 on here?
**Asupit**: That's a different one.
**Justin**: We don't have 23 on.
**Justin**: On here.
**Asupit**: Okay.
**Justin**: And I.
**Justin**: I didn't record the full because for 2023, there were a lot of.
**Justin**: A lot of other jobs that were completed in 2023, whether they started in 22 or ended in, you know, started in 23.
**Justin**: So I.
**Justin**: I did not go through to do all that detail because that means I would have had to do 22 and all of that.
**Justin**: So.
**Justin**: But to the jobs that were on the 2024 WIP that he noted as completed in 2023.
**Asupit**: Yep.
**Justin**: We did book the.
**Justin**: The over and under in 2023.
**Asupit**: Okay.
**Asupit**: Yeah.
**Asupit**: And that.
**Asupit**: And that's fine.
**Asupit**: Anything that finished in 2030, I'm not concerned about.
**Justin**: Yeah, so we removed those from here.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Asupit**: So in 23, we do have an over.
**Asupit**: Under asset and liability.
**Justin**: Yes.
**Asupit**: All right.
**Asupit**: Yep.
**Asupit**: So that.
**Asupit**: Depending on how big that can you show.
**Asupit**: Can you share that real quick?
**Asupit**: Fatima?
**Asupit**: Trying to squeeze as much information from you as possible.
**Asupit**: Sorry.
**Bclymer**: It's okay.
**Justin**: Right here.
**Asupit**: 1.1.
**Justin**: Yeah, 1.1.
**Justin**: And the liability is about.
**Asupit**: The debit balance.
**Kjin**: 433.
**Asupit**: Interesting.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Kjin**: Credit.
**Kjin**: 433.
**Kjin**: Ending balance.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Kjin**: You're saying this is for 2023, right?
**Justin**: Yes.
**Kjin**: Okay.
**Asupit**: Okay.
**Asupit**: That seems.
**Asupit**: That seems off, right?
**Asupit**: It shouldn't be a debit balance.
**Asupit**: Should be a net credit.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Justin**: I'll pull up the detail.
**Justin**: Because there were some jobs that had.
**Justin**: That had billings in 2024 that.
**Justin**: He said the work ended in 2023, so we had to.
**Justin**: No, they had billings in 2023, and I think he said the work started in 2024.
**Asupit**: Okay.
**Asupit**: Yeah.
**Justin**: So we had to reverse it, basically, you know, remove it from 2024.
**Justin**: I have to look at the.
**Justin**: The.
**Justin**: The detail.
**Asupit**: Okay.
**Asupit**: Yeah, that would.
**Asupit**: That would be good.
**Asupit**: Because ultimately, at the end of the day, we can't have a debit balance and liabilities.
**Asupit**: It's either an asset or that.
**Asupit**: That has to be money that came in before they started the work, before they earned it.
**Asupit**: That's what the liability would be.
**Kjin**: Yeah, it's like deferred revenues.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Justin**: So he's.
**Justin**: I think he was saying that they were billed.
**Justin**: They had revenue in 2024.
**Justin**: So he was saying that they.
**Justin**: The work ended in 20, in 2023.
**Justin**: So we had to reverse out the 2024 revenue and actually move it to 2023.
**Asupit**: You move the revenue from 24 to 23, correct?
**Justin**: Yes.
**Justin**: Yes.
**Justin**: Because he's saying that they ended the work was completed in 2020.
**Justin**: 23, but they built in 2024.
**Asupit**: They build in 24.
**Asupit**: So that.
**Asupit**: That 433.
**Asupit**: And for 2023 purposes, that 2023 should be cost in excess of billings because they did not bill it yet in 23.
**Asupit**: They build it in 24.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Justin**: So it needs to go to the cost.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Asupit**: It needs.
**Asupit**: And yeah, so basically this needs to be now reclassed into the asset cost.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Asupit**: And then so what?
**Asupit**: And then this is going to be zero.
**Asupit**: So what that's telling me is in 2023 they never build anything in advance.
**Asupit**: When it becomes zero, there were no billings in advance.
**Kjin**: That kind of makes sense because it's, it's what he said is that he did a lot of pre.
**Kjin**: I guess pre designs, prepayments.
**Kjin**: Right.
**Kjin**: So they haven't build them.
**Asupit**: No, that was, that was a subcontractor that built them up front.
**Asupit**: Okay, that was a subcontractor.
**Asupit**: But as far as Aliado, maybe can you confirm that?
**Asupit**: So we can make this.
**Asupit**: Fatima, if you can make this reclass and then if you can confirm with Brandon or Jesse that after everything is said and done, it seems like for 2023 we never build in advance for any of our jobs.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Asupit**: Subcontractors may have, but we didn't to our customers.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Justin**: And I guess, and, and I guess one thing to remember also is like we, we only even if they had built.
**Justin**: Well, yeah, because some of the jobs that ended in 2023, some of the jobs that didn't make it to 2024 would have been billed out and cost all balanced out in 2023.
**Asupit**: One more time please.
**Justin**: So if a job ended in 2023, they wouldn't and didn't bill anything in 2024.
**Justin**: Those wouldn't count because they'll just be zero.
**Justin**: There wouldn't be any overbilling.
**Asupit**: Oh yeah.
**Kjin**: Should be completed.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**Asupit**: Overbills when you bill in advance of doing any work.
**Kjin**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Asupit**: But you're saying the service was all done in 23.
**Kjin**: 2023.
**Asupit**: So that should be.
**Justin**: I.
**Justin**: I think I may have had it backwards.
**Justin**: This should have gone to the cost in excess.
**Justin**: They should have gone to the asset.
**Justin**: And maybe the other one, the other one should have gone to the liability, the other entry.
**Justin**: So I think I have it backwards.
**Kjin**: I think make sure double check if your equity, since you're making all these changes.
**Kjin**: Right.
**Kjin**: Make sure your equity and retained earnings roll forward.
**Kjin**: If not, then these possibly are just like expenses.
**Kjin**: I'm not sure.
**Kjin**: But just double check.
**Kjin**: If there is a big difference of the retained earnings roll forwarding or equity roll forward, then it's probably because of this account.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Justin**: I think it's this account.
**Kjin**: Yeah.
**Kjin**: Because the cash, it can't be cash because we're really close to our cash confirmation.
**Kjin**: So it has to be like an expense.
**Kjin**: So double check because it is a big under billing amount like 1.1 plus 433,000.
**Kjin**: It's like 1.5 million which we didn't even have last year.
**Kjin**: And I guess that's something that we have to kind of decide how we're going to get comfortable with that amount, but make sure that the equity rolls as well.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Justin**: I think I remember the Ulta Dallas just alone had 700 and something.
**Justin**: Thousand.
**Justin**: Yeah, just that one alone was.
**Justin**: Was pretty big.
**Kjin**: Yeah.
**Asupit**: Yeah, yeah, you're right.
**Asupit**: And that's like.
**Asupit**: That's what I was thought in the beginning.
**Asupit**: This 433 needs to be in the asset.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Asupit**: And then just double con, double, triple confirm with Brandon that they did not bill in advance in 23.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Asupit**: And if he says yes, that justifies the zero balance after you do the reclass.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Asupit**: If he says no, we actually build in advance for this job.
**Asupit**: This job, this job code.
**Asupit**: Then we need to revisit and see where our over billing or what our overbilling should be.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Asupit**: And if you can do that.
**Asupit**: Sorry.
**Asupit**: If you can do that as soon as practical.
**Asupit**: We really want to get on top of our selections.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Asupit**: Thank you, Fatima.
**Justin**: All right, not a problem.
**Justin**: I'll.
**Justin**: Yeah, I'll update this and get it back to you guys.
**Asupit**: Thank you so much.
**Justin**: All right.
**Justin**: No problem.
**Asupit**: All right, take care.
**Asupit**: Talk soon.
**Justin**: All right, bye.
**Bclymer**: Bye.
**Bclymer**: Okay, bye.
**Bclymer**: Sa.
