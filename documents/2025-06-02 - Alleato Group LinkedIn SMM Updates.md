**Victoria**: Yeah, it's okay.
**Victoria**: Let's just start with without him, and we'll see if we need, you know, clarification or anything.
**Ataylor**: Sure, absolutely.
**Ataylor**: Okay, so this is calendar.
**Ataylor**: So a quick month overview.
**Ataylor**: We've got content to look over for the whole month.
**Ataylor**: I've edited together the Meet the Millers video and the intern video.
**Ataylor**: I love that you guys are.
**Victoria**: That was so funny.
**Victoria**: They were just recording and recording again.
**Victoria**: And so aj, Just so you know, there was field team did like a parody of the We Are the Millers movie.
**Victoria**: You know, when they're like, yeah, you're getting paid.
**Victoria**: Are you getting paid?
**Victoria**: So the intern was like, are you guys getting paid?
**Victoria**: So that was funny.
**Victoria**: So I add different videos.
**Victoria**: They did.
**Victoria**: So just let me know, Anika, if we need to do something.
**Victoria**: But they were excited for that too.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, no, I, I, I put it together best I could with what we had.
**Ataylor**: Mostly there's.
**Ataylor**: They weren't really in frame most of the time.
**Victoria**: I know.
**Victoria**: And the first one, they were out of frame, and I was like, no way, guys.
**Bclymer**: That sounds.
**Bclymer**: That sounds like a bunch of construction guys trying to film some social media content.
**Victoria**: Ugly.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Victoria**: But you know what?
**Victoria**: Chad should be an actor.
**Victoria**: Chad just came in and started, like, talking and saying, like, are you guys really.
**Victoria**: And I Was like, wow.
**Victoria**: Like, he was like on point.
**Victoria**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: That's funny.
**Victoria**: Yeah, he was.
**Ataylor**: He was the.
**Ataylor**: The main guy, I'm assuming.
**Ataylor**: I didn't know their names, but the guy came to the door.
**Victoria**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: So, I mean, we could even start there if we wanted.
**Ataylor**: But why don't we start on the beginning of June just to.
**Ataylor**: To start the beginning.
**Ataylor**: Let's go down.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: So this is the infographic why 3 PL leaders build with Alito.
**Ataylor**: This information I've gotten off of the site.
**Ataylor**: Another thing I want to clarify is I've noticed there are changes to the site actively happening.
**Victoria**: Yes.
**Ataylor**: Ready to be linked to or do we want to wait to link to the site and then with this information, is it correct?
**Ataylor**: I got it off the site maybe a week and a half ago, so I don't know if anything's been updated, but it would probably need a closer look.
**Ataylor**: I know it's kind of small.
**Victoria**: Yeah, yeah.
**Ataylor**: If you're.
**Bclymer**: If you're pulling from the website, I already know Brandon's going to want to change whatever, probably when it comes to the content.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Victoria**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, this is.
**Ataylor**: I know it's a new page, so I don't know when it was updated, but yeah, we'll take a closer here.
**Victoria**: As we were running.
**Victoria**: If he doesn't join for this one, Anika, I'll just forward the exact thing, you know, like the infographic for him to review right away.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, it'd probably.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, but this is new.
**Victoria**: Yeah, you're right.
**Victoria**: We updated the website with Megan, I think a week ago, so.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Right.
**Ataylor**: So I mean, this is.
**Ataylor**: This is the information that I used and I'll send all of this to.
**Ataylor**: To you both so that he can take it like a closer look at it because it's hard to read up the screen anyway.
**Ataylor**: Okay, this is a Brandon quote.
**Ataylor**: That was.
**Victoria**: You're showing us still the website, so can you.
**Victoria**: Oh, yeah, that's good.
**Victoria**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: This is a branding quote.
**Ataylor**: Be urgent early.
**Ataylor**: And then the.
**Victoria**: That was good.
**Victoria**: That was during a conversation he has with somebody talking about a project.
**Victoria**: And he came out with.
**Victoria**: I don't know what happened to him that day, but he was just like saying so many good words and I was like.
**Victoria**: So he was like, should we using it for marketing?
**Victoria**: I'm like, yeah, so we just had like 15 or something that I send and then we kind of like narrow it down for the ones that we like.
**Victoria**: So that's a yes for sure.
**Victoria**: He liked that.
**Victoria**: So perfect.
**Ataylor**: Okay, that's looking good.
**Ataylor**: Okay, now we can Pop into the Neatha Miller's video.
**Victoria**: Yeah, I want to see that.
**Ataylor**: We'll see how it goes with sharing it like this.
**Ataylor**: And then if not, I'm gonna create this link that I can send in the chat.
**Ataylor**: But here, let me know if you can hear it and if it's.
**Ataylor**: It might be a little blocked, like scratchy, you know, over the.
**Ataylor**: Over zoom.
**Victoria**: Okay.
**Victoria**: The plumbing.
**Victoria**: What's wrong with you?
**Victoria**: This dang weather's killing us.
**Victoria**: Ah, we'll be fine.
**Victoria**: We'll be fine.
**Victoria**: This project's got a deadline, dude.
**Victoria**: I'm not going to lose $500,000 just cuz Ian has got another boo boo.
**Victoria**: 500 grand.
**Victoria**: I'm only getting paid.
**Bclymer**: 300 guys are getting paid.
**Victoria**: That's a good one.
**Victoria**: So I have another video of Chad.
**Victoria**: I don't know if you saw it on the folder I did with Chad.
**Victoria**: Yeah, so the one in the door, you know, like he was at the door and then the intern, Ian was another.
**Victoria**: He was a minute with another video.
**Victoria**: So that's up to you.
**Victoria**: Whatever you feel comfortable with.
**Victoria**: But you didn't like that one.
**Ataylor**: The one with that one.
**Ataylor**: Oh, so okay, I see what you mean.
**Ataylor**: So that would have been like a separate take.
**Victoria**: Yes.
**Victoria**: So do you have the folder there so I can show you?
**Ataylor**: So I put the all together because like for consistency, they weren't standing in the same places.
**Ataylor**: So when you watched, you would have been like, how did they get there?
**Ataylor**: But with the other two, I didn't think about putting those two together and not using any of these videos.
**Victoria**: Let me see how it goes.
**Victoria**: Yeah, we have.
**Ataylor**: Okay, I do have the.
**Ataylor**: How do I get to it?
**Ataylor**: I've got to go to my email, which is fine.
**Ataylor**: It's right here.
**Victoria**: Yeah, if not I can share my screen.
**Victoria**: Don't worry.
**Ataylor**: No, it's okay.
**Ataylor**: I've got it.
**Ataylor**: Right.
**Victoria**: Okay, perfect.
**Ataylor**: Okay, so let's see.
**Victoria**: So check the.
**Victoria**: Yeah, I think it's that one.
**Victoria**: No, that's an old one.
**Victoria**: So.
**Ataylor**: Oh, did my screen stop sharing?
**Ataylor**: I think I did.
**Victoria**: Let's.
**Ataylor**: I'm just gonna share this window and then.
**Ataylor**: Okay, so.
**Victoria**: That'S the other one.
**Victoria**: So you already have that.
**Victoria**: So I think it's chats.
**Victoria**: That's the one, I think.
**Victoria**: Yeah.
**Victoria**: So that's another.
**Victoria**: So he was actually.
**Victoria**: Yeah, like talking there with Andrew.
**Victoria**: But I don't know if you saw Andrew in the.
**Victoria**: The tape.
**Victoria**: That's the thing.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, so yeah, he's not in it.
**Victoria**: But that's.
**Ataylor**: I mean like if you thought we should just do this one.
**Ataylor**: And then.
**Victoria**: Yeah, we jump to the other part.
**Victoria**: And then if you saw the first one.
**Victoria**: Yeah, that's the intern Ian saying, no, that is.
**Victoria**: Which one did I share?
**Ataylor**: There's one where it comes to the door.
**Victoria**: That's the one.
**Victoria**: Yeah, that's the one.
**Victoria**: Yeah.
**Victoria**: But it doesn't make sense because now out of frame is Andrew.
**Victoria**: So we lost Andrew.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, we lost Andrew.
**Ataylor**: And then this door is already open, and then we don't see them.
**Victoria**: So like.
**Victoria**: So maybe you know what we can do because we don't see chat.
**Victoria**: Maybe I know he's entering.
**Victoria**: So maybe just a little frame of him entering the door and that's it.
**Victoria**: You know when in the first video when he's just like slamming the door, like very angry or something.
**Victoria**: Maybe we can grab that part.
**Victoria**: That part when he's just like, with the door and then you just.
**Victoria**: Cause right away for him walking.
**Victoria**: I don't know if it's possible.
**Victoria**: I'm just, you know, just trying to see if maybe we can add a little frame of chat.
**Victoria**: I know, I know.
**Ataylor**: I was thinking that too.
**Ataylor**: I tried to get this frame in, but the.
**Ataylor**: Just the consistency of where he was standing and looking.
**Victoria**: Yeah, maybe you're right.
**Ataylor**: Because we have him walking in the door, and then it's just that we don't have any of him speaking.
**Victoria**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: Because he comes in really nicely here, but then you.
**Ataylor**: You just can't see him.
**Ataylor**: And then say, I know this guy here.
**Bclymer**: When is this post scheduled to go out?
**Ataylor**: This is.
**Victoria**: June.
**Victoria**: I can't ask him to do it again.
**Victoria**: Yeah, that's fine.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I was gonna say just have them.
**Victoria**: Yeah.
**Victoria**: Because they will, like, chat on it too.
**Victoria**: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Ataylor**: Try to.
**Ataylor**: I liked what they did a lot with the multiple angles here.
**Ataylor**: They had a camera, like two cameras.
**Ataylor**: If they can just make sure that they are it like on video when they're talking, then we'll be in a good spot.
**Victoria**: When is it a schedule?
**Victoria**: June.
**Ataylor**: We can move it.
**Ataylor**: But it's June 10th right now.
**Victoria**: June what?
**Ataylor**: S tenth?
**Victoria**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: We could move.
**Victoria**: Let me text them right now.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: If you want, they can see this video of how what they did came together.
**Ataylor**: And then they could be like, oh, I see that I'm not in frame.
**Victoria**: Yeah.
**Victoria**: Did you.
**Victoria**: You share the link to the chat right here?
**Ataylor**: I haven't shared.
**Victoria**: Oh, no, you didn't.
**Victoria**: Can you share it on the chat?
**Victoria**: I can show them.
**Victoria**: Like, guys, we love these one.
**Victoria**: But if police chat can be.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, you can see, like, in frame.
**Ataylor**: What's what's going wrong, guys?
**Bclymer**: I.
**Bclymer**: I have to drop for like 15 minutes to run in.
**Ataylor**: Sure thing.
**Ataylor**: All right.
**Ataylor**: Okay, let's see.
**Ataylor**: Okay, so in the chat.
**Victoria**: Right now, as this is the.
**Victoria**: This video, like to re.
**Victoria**: How do you say that?
**Victoria**: React.
**Victoria**: Redo, redo.
**Victoria**: We would like to reach you.
**Victoria**: Can we make sure we can see chat.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, see both.
**Ataylor**: See everyone's faces.
**Victoria**: We can see chat.
**Ataylor**: And then also, like.
**Victoria**: See.
**Victoria**: Hopefully they have time.
**Victoria**: Let's see.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Victoria**: Okay, perfect.
**Ataylor**: So that's good.
**Victoria**: So I'll just give you.
**Victoria**: Send you an update soon.
**Ataylor**: Okay, thank you.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, that's perfect.
**Ataylor**: The other thing that I need from you guys is Jose, Fatima's and Kiva.
**Victoria**: I think I already have.
**Victoria**: You already have Jose.
**Victoria**: You already have Fatima on the folder.
**Victoria**: It's missing Keva.
**Victoria**: Let me add it right now.
**Ataylor**: Okay, gotcha.
**Ataylor**: And then is.
**Ataylor**: I just have to search for it.
**Victoria**: His photo.
**Victoria**: His photo was.
**Victoria**: He sent it to me.
**Victoria**: Oh.
**Victoria**: The requested information.
**Victoria**: What is his photo?
**Victoria**: Send me a pic.
**Victoria**: I'm sure.
**Victoria**: Oh, there it is.
**Victoria**: I got you.
**Victoria**: So save image us.
**Victoria**: This is Kev and he is assistant project manager.
**Ataylor**: Oh, I see Kevin here.
**Victoria**: You see fat.
**Victoria**: Oh, perfect.
**Victoria**: He's there already.
**Victoria**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: Let me see the Fatima.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Victoria**: So Fatima is there.
**Ataylor**: We've got all three of them.
**Ataylor**: Is there anybody else?
**Victoria**: Is Jose better?
**Ataylor**: Yes, it is better.
**Ataylor**: It's clearer.
**Ataylor**: It's bigger.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, it's okay.
**Victoria**: Awesome.
**Ataylor**: No problem.
**Victoria**: So you have them there?
**Victoria**: Yeah, we just need to crop the background a little bit, but other than that, it's good.
**Victoria**: Well, I'll.
**Ataylor**: I'll remove the background, I think.
**Victoria**: All right, good.
**Ataylor**: I remove the background and all see?
**Ataylor**: Perfect on this one because it's just a fake guy, but nice.
**Ataylor**: So that looks good.
**Victoria**: So that's good.
**Victoria**: Yep, I saw that too.
**Victoria**: I love those.
**Victoria**: I don't have any comments, to be honest.
**Victoria**: I don't know if Brandon will have.
**Ataylor**: Asynchronously too.
**Ataylor**: I just go in the dock and make comments or changes.
**Ataylor**: Totally fine.
**Victoria**: Yeah.
**Victoria**: Okay.
**Victoria**: I think it's good.
**Victoria**: Maybe we should put at the end.
**Victoria**: That's why a leader group or something like that.
**Victoria**: When did we build this?
**Ataylor**: I'm not sure.
**Ataylor**: It's on the site, so you can see.
**Victoria**: Oh, I see.
**Victoria**: Oh, you're right.
**Victoria**: Can you go back to your project?
**Victoria**: I think we have more, right?
**Ataylor**: Oh, yeah, we absolutely do.
**Victoria**: Yeah.
**Victoria**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: So I pulled from here.
**Victoria**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: And Serena by the sea is the other one.
**Ataylor**: That.
**Victoria**: Yeah.
**Victoria**: Okay, perfect.
**Victoria**: That makes sense.
**Victoria**: Yeah.
**Victoria**: Maybe we can put at the end something related to that's.
**Victoria**: Why a little group isn't.
**Victoria**: Is.
**Victoria**: You know, or.
**Victoria**: I don't know if it's a number one, but that's why people chose us.
**Victoria**: Or because we deliver on time.
**Victoria**: Something like that.
**Victoria**: You know, something about.
**Victoria**: About us.
**Victoria**: Because that's good that you're talking about the project, but at the end, like, why they should pick us.
**Victoria**: No.
**Ataylor**: Okay, great.
**Ataylor**: Okay, let's see.
**Victoria**: I love that one too.
**Victoria**: That's good.
**Ataylor**: Oh, yeah, this is a longer one, but we start with.
**Victoria**: Yep.
**Ataylor**: Vision, and then these guys.
**Victoria**: Okay, so you have random review it.
**Victoria**: I'll ask him to go to this thing right now and review it.
**Victoria**: So don't worry.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, yeah, no worries.
**Ataylor**: You can.
**Ataylor**: It's totally fine if he wants to review.
**Victoria**: Sounds good.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: Okay, let's see.
**Ataylor**: And then here's the intern video.
**Victoria**: Oh, yeah.
**Victoria**: Let me see how it goes.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, this.
**Ataylor**: This one worked really well.
**Ataylor**: Okay, ready?
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Victoria**: Maybe that's video is a little bit repetitive for the first one, so maybe we can finish with him talking, you know, like, go back again to his face talking, and that's it.
**Victoria**: But that's awesome.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, that's.
**Ataylor**: That's okay.
**Victoria**: Yeah, that's.
**Victoria**: But the other one is perfect.
**Victoria**: I think it's good.
**Victoria**: Yeah.
**Victoria**: He was super happy to do the video, and that's why I asked for different, you know, things for him doing.
**Victoria**: Not just talking, but actually he working.
**Ataylor**: So.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Victoria**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: Oh, my gosh.
**Ataylor**: It was great with all these shots of him doing things.
**Ataylor**: Perfect addition.
**Victoria**: That's good.
**Victoria**: Awesome.
**Victoria**: We just need to change that little clip.
**Victoria**: That's good too.
**Victoria**: That's a good to go.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Victoria**: Yep.
**Victoria**: That's another.
**Victoria**: Yeah, that's another one from the things that I sent you.
**Victoria**: Right?
**Victoria**: That's good.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Victoria**: And then Serena.
**Victoria**: See, that's good.
**Victoria**: I love it.
**Victoria**: Yeah.
**Victoria**: We design.
**Victoria**: Yeah.
**Victoria**: Don't forget always at the end.
**Victoria**: Why a little.
**Victoria**: You know, that's why a little group is.
**Victoria**: Maybe we can.
**Victoria**: We should come up with a slogan or something like, you know, instead of your.
**Victoria**: Or we can say that's why we are your partners from the grown up.
**Victoria**: Something like that, you know?
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Victoria**: Yeah.
**Victoria**: She lose that one?
**Ataylor**: Okay, I'll workshop that.
**Ataylor**: That's perfect.
**Ataylor**: And then this is another video we're hoping to film if get it together and it's by the end of the month.
**Ataylor**: We could even push it to July if we need more time.
**Ataylor**: But it would be a day in the life of a project manager or field manager.
**Ataylor**: So these are the exact shots that we would need.
**Ataylor**: And then.
**Ataylor**: So there's pretty much everything that the team would need to film it here.
**Ataylor**: And then we kind of see what we come up with.
**Victoria**: Okay, so project managers.
**Victoria**: So we have A.J.
**Victoria**: we have Nick, we have.
**Victoria**: I don't think Glenn is going to do it.
**Victoria**: He said he's not that comfortable doing videos with the camera.
**Victoria**: And I was like, okay, it's fine if you don't feel comfortable.
**Victoria**: That's okay.
**Bclymer**: Nick's not comfortable either.
**Victoria**: Nick is not going to do it.
**Victoria**: So you'll do it.
**Bclymer**: I do project management for us, but I would.
**Bclymer**: I can definitely.
**Bclymer**: If you guys need something, I know.
**Victoria**: You will because you're actually good with the camera and actually didn't know, but you're a good chef, aj.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: You didn't know that?
**Bclymer**: Oh, yeah, that's.
**Victoria**: I didn't know that.
**Victoria**: I was looking at the deal.
**Victoria**: You know, I have a little group page, and then I saw that you have a page for cooking.
**Victoria**: I was, no way.
**Victoria**: And I saw that.
**Victoria**: I was like, oh, my gosh, he's so good.
**Bclymer**: I do all the cooking.
**Bclymer**: I used to take cooking glasses.
**Victoria**: Oh, wow, that was really good.
**Victoria**: Yeah, we should push that pitch too, you know, that's really good.
**Victoria**: Anyway, so.
**Victoria**: I know.
**Victoria**: I know AJ will do something.
**Victoria**: And you know who wants to do something that he's more comfortable?
**Victoria**: Jack.
**Victoria**: So Jack, he told me that he was going to purchase a selfie stick, so he kind of wants to for him.
**Victoria**: He really enjoyed doing videos and he sent you another one.
**Victoria**: So I think I sent you an email with another videos from Westfield Connect.
**Victoria**: Westfield and Bloomington.
**Victoria**: So I'll ask Jack if he would like to, because he's comfortable with that.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Victoria**: And maybe Andrew.
**Victoria**: Andrew also likes to, you know, Andrew.
**Bclymer**: Andrew can do it.
**Victoria**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Alex.
**Victoria**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: If you tell him what to do, would do it.
**Victoria**: Maybe.
**Victoria**: Yeah, we'll test with Alex.
**Victoria**: I'm for sure know that AJ and Andrew will.
**Victoria**: Will do it and maybe Jack.
**Victoria**: But I know he will.
**Victoria**: And then.
**Victoria**: So Jack is a superintendent.
**Victoria**: So you know the difference.
**Victoria**: Yeah.
**Victoria**: So Jack is a superintendent.
**Victoria**: Aj, you know, is a project manager.
**Victoria**: And also your other thing.
**Victoria**: Right.
**Victoria**: You have two titles.
**Bclymer**: I'm.
**Bclymer**: I'm a project executive.
**Bclymer**: We just are light on project.
**Bclymer**: Yes, we're just light on project managers right now.
**Victoria**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Victoria**: So.
**Bclymer**: And you know, I manage projects too.
**Victoria**: So you can put a project executive, because AJ is project executive, and then Andrew is project engineer.
**Victoria**: Just so.
**Victoria**: So you probably will have these three, Andrew, you know, project engineer, project executive, and superintendent.
**Victoria**: So the life of these three.
**Victoria**: And maybe we can post them in different, you know, and then if you want other type of videos, I send you Westfield drone footage.
**Victoria**: That was really good.
**Victoria**: And Wilmington video that Jack sent, and I send you a little caption to it, so we can use that one as well if, you know, part of the.
**Victoria**: Of the calendar.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, that sounds good.
**Ataylor**: Do you want to include Alex on this list or.
**Victoria**: Yeah, you can put Alex Sensitive, and he's also.
**Victoria**: He is indeed a project manager.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Alex is not.
**Bclymer**: Alex is a superintendent.
**Victoria**: Oh, you're right.
**Victoria**: Sorry.
**Victoria**: You're so right.
**Victoria**: I keep always.
**Victoria**: Yeah.
**Victoria**: Alex is superintendent.
**Victoria**: I don't.
**Victoria**: I don't think Kendall will do it.
**Victoria**: I don't think Mike.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I'm not sure if Mike would do it.
**Victoria**: I'm not sure about Keva, to be honest.
**Victoria**: He's assistant project manager, but I'm not sure.
**Bclymer**: He's new.
**Bclymer**: Give him a couple.
**Bclymer**: Give him a couple of months.
**Victoria**: I agree with you.
**Victoria**: Yeah.
**Victoria**: I don't think he will be, you know, like.
**Victoria**: Yeah.
**Victoria**: Yeah.
**Victoria**: Okay, so we'll try with those four.
**Victoria**: Okay.
**Victoria**: But.
**Victoria**: I know.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, I think that sounds good.
**Victoria**: Those three, for sure.
**Ataylor**: Okay, great.
**Ataylor**: Well, yeah, so this would work for all of those role.
**Ataylor**: So anyone wants to.
**Victoria**: So let me.
**Victoria**: Let me send that to them and then also to AJ Because I know he might forget.
**Victoria**: So I'll send it to him.
**Ataylor**: Okay, great.
**Ataylor**: Well, that is.
