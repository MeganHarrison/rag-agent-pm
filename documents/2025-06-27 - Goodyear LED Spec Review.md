## Transcript
**William.twickler**: Sa.
**Chris.query**: Hey, guys.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: Hey, Bill.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: How are you?
**Bclymer**: Hey, Bill.
**Chris.query**: Good, good, good, good.
**Chris.query**: Jesse, thanks for kind of, you know.
**Chris.query**: I know, I know.
**Chris.query**: We just kind of threw this down, so.
**Chris.query**: We appreciate you guys jumping, being able to jump on.
**Bclymer**: Hey, no problem.
**Bclymer**: And I revised that.
**Bclymer**: Brandon called me and you know, just to take out, you know, and I just figured like, you know, we plan on like a month of time just setting up, and then if we did all the rest of the work, it would just.
**Bclymer**: All the, you know, labor and expenses we'd have would just flow into the rest of the job.
**Bclymer**: So that's all that is just the difference of now for lights.
**Bclymer**: We tying up a couple people for the next five months while they're putting lights in, you know.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: Yeah.
**Chris.query**: So does this.
**Chris.query**: Does this take us back to where we were.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Chris.query**: Previously.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Chris.query**: So our last quote mimics this or the first quote we got.
**Chris.query**: Does it mimic it?
**Chris.query**: I haven't tried to compare everything.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: This will be the same as the original lighting quote.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: You can see.
**Bclymer**: Well, it's off by $5 because when I redid it, you know, and pulled the.
**Bclymer**: The scope out of, you know, the overall number is.
**Bclymer**: So when we sent that, you had us break it out of that.
**Bclymer**: And it's $5 difference.
**Bclymer**: That's just the calculations in the spreadsheet.
**Bclymer**: And that would take me a half a day to figure out where that's at.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Chris.query**: Yeah, I don't think we need it.
**Chris.query**: We're not worried about $5.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: When you subtract like from our overall number, you subtract this number.
**Bclymer**: That's the difference.
**William.twickler**: Are you saying.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: I'm not following you on that because I was trying to find the email.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: But if this is regarding the now, the cost is 2.3.
**Bclymer**: No, no, it's.
**Bclymer**: It's back.
**Bclymer**: It's the one I just sent.
**Bclymer**: It's revision three.
**William.twickler**: Okay.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: No, I have revision too.
**Bclymer**: Hold on.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I just said maybe 10 minutes ago.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: Okay, I see now.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: 2.078.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: So.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: So what we need.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: Okay, now we will need to add the $211,000.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: You don't get the whole boss's scope of work, the lighting and the.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: And the GC work.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I'm just saying, like, you know, we're gonna tie up a couple people for that.
**Bclymer**: A super and a pm.
**Bclymer**: And if now they.
**Bclymer**: They're.
**Bclymer**: They've got to spend time on there for the next five months just running the lighting versus being able to run the whole job.
**Bclymer**: That's the only reason for that.
**Bclymer**: And Again, it's just a quick swag of the time.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: Okay.
**Chris.query**: Just bear with me one second.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: So those 211,000 will be the general requirements?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, it be including.
**Bclymer**: Because I think, you know, all of our permitting, you know, the cost to spend time and do that.
**Bclymer**: A lot of that's in the original.
**Chris.query**: So.
**Chris.query**: So, Jesse, help me bridge this.
**Chris.query**: Okay, so we had a quote back on.
**Bclymer**: The 17th, okay.
**Chris.query**: In that quote we had a price of 2 million 8, 9, 6, 8.
**Chris.query**: And in the scope of work, it's indicating 2260 high bay lights, 13 400amp panels, 604 exit signs, etc.
**Bclymer**: The only difference is the general conditions because that was just a quote for the lights.
**Bclymer**: If you notice, it didn't have any GCs in it.
**Bclymer**: So that's the only difference between this quote and that.
**Bclymer**: And we just took all that out.
**Bclymer**: We talked to the electrician, clarified, you know, what they need.
**Bclymer**: And so we just got rid of all the, the numbers and the panels.
**Bclymer**: It'll be 277 volt lighting and maybe four, maybe five panels they made just to spread them out to lessen all the runs to the lighting circuits.
**Bclymer**: It's based on.
**Bclymer**: I know for sure there are two.
**Bclymer**: I think they.
**Bclymer**: I believe there's three 800amp panels in there currently.
**Bclymer**: So we're figuring on coming out of.
**William.twickler**: Those.
**Bclymer**: To feed our new panels and then maybe using some of the available circuits and some of the other panels are there possibly, but we don't need to.
**Chris.query**: Okay.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: So that's why you took all that information from there.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, it's just, it's confusing and it's like, you know, we got the photometric plan in there too.
**Bclymer**: They knocked that out quick.
**Bclymer**: You know, I looked and there's a couple dark spots that aren't there, but that's just a matter to me.
**Bclymer**: It maybe it's just not computing right, but the coverage is there and they can add a few extra lights if they need to, if a spot needs it.
**Bclymer**: But for the most part it's got you where you need to be.
**William.twickler**: Jesse, have you determined the total load of the lighting?
**William.twickler**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So there he said 950 will get it.
**Bclymer**: And you look.
**Bclymer**: What.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: 150,000 ounce?
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: 950amps.
**William.twickler**: I'm concerned with that number, Jesse.
**William.twickler**: I think it's going to pull more than that because.
**William.twickler**: Yeah, I mean, are you still going with the 2260 fixtures?
**Bclymer**: No, there won't be that many, I don't think.
**Bclymer**: Well, maybe.
**William.twickler**: I think we need to determine because, you know, My concern is, yes, we do have three 800amp panels available, but you know, there's other things that's fed off of that right now.
**William.twickler**: There's, you know, one of those feeds the office area, which it doesn't pull that much load granted.
**William.twickler**: But yeah, the other two in the warehouse, you know, there's, there's a couple other panels that's feeding the restroom space and stuff in the warehouse like that.
**William.twickler**: Yeah, we, we just got to figure out because we can't burn up all three of those panels or if we do, we've got a.
**William.twickler**: We've got to set some more, you know, larger distribution distribution panels, like maybe the, some more 800amp.
**Bclymer**: Well, I have no doubt we're going to be adding more 800amp.
**Bclymer**: Like we're going to have to take every single thing coming out of the.
**Bclymer**: Those main switch gear and put an 800amp panel in the building on them.
**Bclymer**: Because, you know, I'm adding up, you know, some of all the things we talked about yesterday.
**Bclymer**: I got a truer number on your equipment from our sub and I was.
**Bclymer**: I can share here.
**William.twickler**: Yeah, I mean, eventually we're going to have to set, we're going to have to use everything out of those switch gears.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**William.twickler**: We're going to have to set probably five more 800amp panels, you know, for the battery chargers and things like that.
**William.twickler**: But I just don't see.
**William.twickler**: Because looking at your specs on your lighting, the 60,000 lumens, they pull 421 watts.
**William.twickler**: So that's an amp, amp and a half a piece roughly.
**William.twickler**: Even, Even if you bring it down to 2,000 fixtures, you know, that's, that's what, 3,000amps.
**William.twickler**: And that doesn't include the additional lighting that's on the receipt and shipping docks.
**Bclymer**: So his, and I'm not electrician, but here's what my electrician said.
**Bclymer**: He said I was low.
**Bclymer**: On average, it's closer to 950.
**Bclymer**: They'll be on occupancy sensors which can be set to turn off as low as 15 seconds.
**Bclymer**: We usually do five minutes and calculate that with a 60% demand factor, which brings it down to 570amps continuously.
**William.twickler**: Yeah, but those lights are good.
**William.twickler**: Those lights are going to be on quite a bit, you know, quite a bit because those aisles are going to be occupying those aisles.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, all the time.
**William.twickler**: It's going to be a busy site.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay, well, and we can dial into that, you know, more that, you know, they, they got us this photo metric plan in a day so now we can have time to digest that.
**Bclymer**: And, and I can, you know, their engineer, like if we get released today, he's going to have a permit drawing ready to be submitted Tuesday of next week.
**Bclymer**: Which talking with them too.
**Bclymer**: They do a lot of work in Phoenix and we have to pull what's called a at risk permit or they won't do it.
**Bclymer**: Because they don't.
**Bclymer**: These inspectors will tear you up if you're working without a permit.
**Bclymer**: So we can't do like we were just going to work and wait till we get a permit.
**Bclymer**: And that permit takes about two weeks to get.
**Bclymer**: So that would push us out to the start date where we want to be, you know, best case.
**Chris.query**: With the.
**Bclymer**: Two weeks to get that permit.
**William.twickler**: So in your quote it says that.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: Go ahead, Chris.
**William.twickler**: If, if released, if, if we would release this to you this week.
**William.twickler**: The permit drawings will be completed on July 1st or end of July or 1st of August.
**Bclymer**: And that was referring to the full like the full project permits like for all the interior build out and the full scope, but electrically we will have a drawing ready to go Tuesday of next week to apply for that at risk permit.
**Bclymer**: And that only allows them to run conduits and set boxes and pull wire, things like that while they're reviewing it, the rest of it.
**William.twickler**: So once awarded the project, if you would get the project, you would have electrical designs.
**William.twickler**: Right.
**William.twickler**: You would have your electrical engineer.
**Bclymer**: They do.
**Bclymer**: Dean does it for us all the time.
**Bclymer**: Really.
**Bclymer**: Every project we've done, they do the permit set ever done with them.
**Bclymer**: I should say.
**William.twickler**: So.
**William.twickler**: Also it said that you would, you know, mobilize when the rack project starts.
**William.twickler**: I mean, I think I would recommend going in like a week ahead of them to start removing fixtures from circuits because you know, they start putting the racking up, you could have racking underneath those rows and it's going to take more, more time to.
**William.twickler**: And difficulty getting to those, those fixtures.
**Bclymer**: Exactly.
**Bclymer**: And that's why our timing wise we're hoping like that's two weeks is the 14th, which is a week before rack starts.
**Bclymer**: If we could get them in there by then and we can get that permit by then.
**Bclymer**: If we can get the permit in two weeks, it kind of works out that we're.
**Bclymer**: We're in there prior to them getting started.
**William.twickler**: Yeah.
**William.twickler**: And they're going to be staging racking in different areas of the building.
**William.twickler**: We need Maitland to show us where that's going to happen.
**William.twickler**: So you can kind of work around that as well.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**William.twickler**: With that amount of racking, it's going to take up a lot of square footage.
**Bclymer**: Speaking of the.
**Bclymer**: How soon, you know, we had Jesse out there, like are you close to signing the lease so that he could get access like every day to go over there and start, you know, getting better as built of everything to coordinate.
**Bclymer**: How difficult will that be?
**Chris.query**: I think, yeah, Hermes.
**Chris.query**: I think we can answer that question better on Monday.
**Chris.query**: Do you agree with that?
**Jarrod.kimmey**: Yeah, I do.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: I know for sure they haven't signed the.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: I don't know if they haven't signed the contract with Amundsen, but I know from the lease standpoint they haven't signed the lease yet.
**Chris.query**: Yeah, yeah.
**Chris.query**: They're both being done like almost concurrently.
**Chris.query**: We're waiting, I mean it could be any hour that we get the final signature from Amazon and as soon as that happens, then that occurs.
**Chris.query**: So I mean, yeah, I think Jesse, we can, I mean we can unders.
**Chris.query**: We, we would know better on Monday regarding that point.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay, thank.
**Bclymer**: So yeah, back on this power.
**Bclymer**: Trying to put all this in here, we got house of 4 RTUs.
**Bclymer**: I was going to be minimum, probably it'll be 75 at least or maybe 100amp.
**Bclymer**: It's probably going to be 100amp.
**Bclymer**: I would just be safe.
**Bclymer**: We got your conveyor panels.
**Bclymer**: I mean we're at 5,000amps right now.
**Bclymer**: And that's what, what you call is a low end on the, on the lighting.
**Chris.query**: So, so correct me if I'm wrong, but we Basically we've got 3000amps for charging.
**Chris.query**: Right.
**Bclymer**: It was, they figured for the 25amps, 24, 75 tuggers 250 is it the big ass fans, they're 10amps a piece.
**Bclymer**: Your lighting fan lights at 3.3amps a piece.
**Bclymer**: Dock lights at 3amps a piece.
**Bclymer**: Conveyor panels, we had two of them, 400amps, you get a couple mini splits.
**Bclymer**: We got a guard shack power, four RTUs.
**Chris.query**: The sort of.
**William.twickler**: I think you're missing some, I think you're missing some forklifts.
**William.twickler**: I think there's, there's 13 swing reach trucks at 35amps.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Here swing reach.
**Bclymer**: How many of those?
**Bclymer**: Those?
**Bclymer**: 14.
**Jdawson**: 13.
**Bclymer**: 13.
**Bclymer**: 13.
**Bclymer**: So 35.
**Bclymer**: 455.
**William.twickler**: And keep in mind there's, there's house panels too that you know, they feed like the parking lot lighting and things like that.
**Bclymer**: Exactly.
**Bclymer**: I meant to look at that.
**William.twickler**: I mean that's probably not a big load, but there is a lot of lighting outside.
**Bclymer**: We got the existing office, got the new office microwaves and that's why, like, I think it would be good if you, if you just had a conversation with those, you know, that company that has the, you know, the battery system for the lifts.
**Bclymer**: Because, like, that's the only way I see us, like having any power at all is by somehow being able to use that.
**Bclymer**: And I know you're, it'd be something you could get in front of Amazon because they're going to want to look and see how this, this type of system works.
**Bclymer**: But.
**William.twickler**: Yeah, I'm not familiar with that system at all.
**William.twickler**: That's the first time I'd seen that system.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, they, and it's, you know, they, according to them, they, they developed it five years ago, tested it for two and a half years and they've been installing them in warehouses for the last two and a half years.
**Bclymer**: So, you know, it's probably, I understand you haven't heard them, but that's again, like you would.
**Bclymer**: I'm not saying they're the everything.
**Bclymer**: It's a matter of just looking into them because, you know, I just found out about them Monday.
**Bclymer**: So it would be a matter of just researching how that works.
**Bclymer**: But like, they had customers that you can contact and they love it because it, you know, it's just more efficient.
**Bclymer**: Now, I don't know if you'd want to put, you know, I don't know how these lifts are used where you'd want one, you know, a way for them to swap a battery out on either side.
**Bclymer**: Or we could, I don't know how hard it would be to re.
**Bclymer**: Redo the layout a little bit to put the, the battery swap station in the middle.
**Bclymer**: It would be more, you know, less time for people going all the way across the warehouse from one side to the other.
**Bclymer**: But, you know, it doesn't, you, like I said, it doesn't matter where you park the lifts anymore.
**Bclymer**: It's simply they just drive by this thing and grab a new battery.
**Chris.query**: Yeah.
**Chris.query**: So we, you know, maybe we can talk about that a little bit more next week.
**Chris.query**: I mean, I will tell you this, this facility is going to move so much material.
**Chris.query**: I just hate to get into a.
**Chris.query**: Adding a piece of automation that we're not, you know, we haven't used before and expecting that to be our silver bullet for Amazon.
**Chris.query**: I mean, I'm just, my initial thought is I'm just very concerned about, you know, thinking about that.
**William.twickler**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Well, one thing, you know, you know, you could think of it this way because we got a problem, like we don't have enough power.
**Bclymer**: So, you know, you could have it as like the difference.
**Bclymer**: Like if, if they want to put, you know, the forklifts and, you know, maybe we got enough power available to do 30 forklift charging stations and it's a combo of that and this system to maybe alleviate the full load of everything else.
**Bclymer**: Like, you know, it's not like you're.
**Bclymer**: I don't know if that would help.
**Bclymer**: Like, you could have their old backup plan that the most we could do with it or even, you know, I don't know how to, to get over that time frame of putting in a new service.
**Bclymer**: To fully power this up the way that is, you know, is going to take months.
**Chris.query**: Yeah, I can, I can tell you I can't.
**Chris.query**: Our challenge is going to be figuring out for this group, figuring out how to make 6,000amps work.
**Chris.query**: Because I can tell you that the hurdles to time and cost to get more power in the building is, is just not going to.
**Chris.query**: To work.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Do you know if.
**Bclymer**: When we talked the other day, you said that they actually.
**Bclymer**: They have 99 forklifts.
**Bclymer**: Say there's going to be 99 people on a forklift every day running that.
**Bclymer**: And they count on charging them during breaks and lunchtime to keep them from running out of juice throughout the day.
**Bclymer**: Wow.
**William.twickler**: Yep.
**William.twickler**: I mean, very seldom you're going to have 126 forklifts charging at the same time because, you know, they'll, they'll go to break.
**William.twickler**: Some people are gonna, they're not gonna plug them in because they're gonna.
**William.twickler**: So they'll be sporadic.
**William.twickler**: When they charge them, it's during, it's during the off hours, like probably after the second shift when everybody leaves, they're going to pull them in, you know, the charging stations and plug them in.
**William.twickler**: Then on weekends as well, which I know we were working some weekends, but.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: How long would you say it takes.
**William.twickler**: A forklift to fully charge the lithium ion?
**William.twickler**: Depending on the level the charge, they're pretty quick.
**William.twickler**: But when they charge, they charge.
**William.twickler**: You know, they're not like a lead acid.
**William.twickler**: Lead acid.
**William.twickler**: When you plug it in, it starts out a full charge and then it trickles down through that eight hours.
**William.twickler**: So you pull less load.
**William.twickler**: You know, the longer you go, you know, it starts charging the battery so you're pulling less load.
**William.twickler**: But with the lithium ion, the charger charges at the same level until the battery's charged.
**William.twickler**: Kind of like your phone, you know, you plug it in and I think it's three hours.
**William.twickler**: It's probably a two to three hour charging time on Those.
**Bclymer**: Well, I'm going to do some more.
**Bclymer**: I'm going to do some more digging, you know, because I do know just from experience with, you know, the car chargers are similar amperage, you know, and I put in systems before that takes one 60amp circuit, feeds four chargers and it may charge them all at 25% till they're all charged up, you know, but allows you to also use less power.
**Bclymer**: And especially if they're not going to be all charging at the same time, then that would be a perfect system because, you know, if there's only one plug to it, it's going to get 100 of that power, you know.
**Bclymer**: You know, it's in a group of four.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Chris.query**: Hey, guys, I'll be right back.
**Chris.query**: Keep on talking.
**Bclymer**: So I'll find that.
**Bclymer**: I just, I got to keep looking and get the right person for that there.
**William.twickler**: Well, another thing to keep in mind, the 126 lifts are required during peak season, which I think Jared is at from like November through December.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, there's a couple peak cycles.
**Jdawson**: I think the one that we'll see will be, I want to say the March time frame and then maybe somewhat in November.
**Jdawson**: But those are the two that we can see based on the forecast that have been provided.
**William.twickler**: So really we're only getting 70 trucks.
**William.twickler**: We're going to lease 70 trucks.
**William.twickler**: And then the other remainder are rentals, right?
**William.twickler**: During peak season?
**Jdawson**: No, I think they're leasing everything.
**William.twickler**: Oh, they're going to go with all of them.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Chris.query**: I believe.
**Jdawson**: I believe so, yes.
**William.twickler**: You know, we may only be using, you know, eight, nine months out of the year.
**William.twickler**: We may only be using 70, 80 trucks.
**William.twickler**: The others may be just parked, you know, if it's not peak season.
**William.twickler**: So I don't know if operations can work with, you know, with the operators to schedule their charges.
**William.twickler**: You know what I'm saying?
**William.twickler**: I mean, it's kind of hard to do that because you're depending on the operators.
**Bclymer**: Well, we can too bring in a.
**William.twickler**: That may be something that we can look at as well.
**Bclymer**: If it's only during certain times.
**Bclymer**: We could bring a generator in too.
**Bclymer**: They make the, you know, we put them on other jobs there.
**Bclymer**: It's basically a generator with a giant battery in it.
**Bclymer**: And the generator only runs when the battery gets drained down.
**Bclymer**: But it's great for things like that where, you know, there's a.
**Bclymer**: Not always a constant load or a max steady load.
**Bclymer**: It doesn't really matter when anything's hooked to it.
**Bclymer**: And then it cuts down a lot on your fuel.
**Bclymer**: Costs.
**Bclymer**: But we could bring one of those in.
**Bclymer**: If we run out of power, and it's only for peak season until we get a new service brought to the building.
**Bclymer**: We could bring one of those in and that would.
**Bclymer**: I mean, we just size that to power however many you wanted to run.
**William.twickler**: Yeah, that's probably a big cost to do that.
**Bclymer**: Not really.
**Bclymer**: It's a rental.
**Bclymer**: So the, the setup, you know, it just depends on the size of the generator.
**Bclymer**: But, you know, you're just renting.
**Bclymer**: Renting it.
**Bclymer**: They said the, you know, the spider boxes or however you want to distribute it into the building.
**Bclymer**: You know, if we found a place where they were parking all the units would be too bad.
**Bclymer**: But I think, you know, you're talking in a month, say $50,000 a month or or so to run one of those units.
**William.twickler**: Well, then you got the cost of all the setup, of all the electrical stuff transfer switches and things like that in the building.
**William.twickler**: You have to.
**William.twickler**: Because you gotta re.
**William.twickler**: You know, you got to connect it to utility power.
**William.twickler**: Then you'd have to disconnect it, connect it to generator power.
**Bclymer**: Well, I'm saying it like.
**Bclymer**: We just simply won't have these plugs hooked up because.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**William.twickler**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So you're, you know, we don't have.
**William.twickler**: Power from the panel.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, these would be set up to, you know, and, you know, the generator, they ran all kinds of.
**Bclymer**: I'm sure I could find a cord end that would go.
**Bclymer**: So they could just plug it right into your.
**Bclymer**: Whatever the charger is on it is.
**Jdawson**: Is there a way to.
**Jdawson**: To get the, the, the current, you know, how much.
**Jdawson**: How much amperage we're.
**Jdawson**: We're currently using in that building right now.
**Bclymer**: I'm sure the power company could look at it like a bill.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I'm just, I'm.
**Jdawson**: I'm thinking.
**Jdawson**: Because that'll tell us maybe what we're going to have to go and try to shave back, you know.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**William.twickler**: I mean, right now it's probably.
**William.twickler**: I'm not sure if that'd be good information, Jared, because they're not that.
**William.twickler**: I don't know when the last time that building's been occupied, but.
**William.twickler**: Yeah, there's just not much in there.
**William.twickler**: The lights have been off.
**William.twickler**: So to get a good reading on that.
**William.twickler**: I don't, I don't know if that would.
**William.twickler**: Because it'd be pretty low, probably.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I, you know, I'm just thinking out loud.
**Jdawson**: Then at least we would know what we're dealing with in terms of the total requirement for the building and how Close we are to six or how much we're over.
**Chris.query**: Well, I think also we're probably going to build a.
**Chris.query**: Maybe to some extent, put some diversity, you know, factor on this that might, you know, help us a little bit.
**Chris.query**: I mean, I think we're just.
**Chris.query**: We're not putting any diversity here, but there's probably still things we've missed here as well.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I mean, and that'll help.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Getting Jesse in there and he can walk that building again and just make sure we're not overlooking something.
**Bclymer**: And I.
**Bclymer**: And I just.
**Bclymer**: I got started on this late, so I didn't put everything that's in, you know, your design, and I can help and do that and see what that adds up to.
**Bclymer**: But if I could find, like, you know, again, I don't if they're okay with that, you know, having.
**Bclymer**: Having like three or four chargers at the, you know, link to one circuit and share that power like that is.
**Bclymer**: That will get us where we need to be, too.
**Chris.query**: Yeah.
**Chris.query**: Hey, Jesse, for a minute.
**Chris.query**: I mean, Chris.
**Chris.query**: Chris and the whole team here.
**Chris.query**: Do we have any more technical questions for Jesse at the moment or.
**Chris.query**: I have some other questions I want to ask him, but I want to.
**Chris.query**: I don't want to, like, jump around.
**William.twickler**: No, I don't.
**William.twickler**: I'm good.
**Bclymer**: Go ahead.
**Chris.query**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Chris.query**: So, Jesse, I'm just going back to the pricing.
**Chris.query**: So, you know, I think on 617, we got this price, and it had.
**Chris.query**: It was 2,008,000, and it included all the stuff I shared.
**Chris.query**: It did not have any general conditions.
**Chris.query**: But then today we got a price.
**Chris.query**: We're at 2,078,000.
**Chris.query**: And it has an adder for the exit signs, whereas the other one.
**Chris.query**: It was included.
**Bclymer**: Well, no, that.
**Bclymer**: That adders only, because there was a comment made, I don't remember where it came from, that maybe we have to provide dedicated power to the emergency lights.
**Bclymer**: And so we just said if they're going to require that.
**Bclymer**: We haven't heard of that before, but here's an adder for that if that comes in.
**Chris.query**: So does that mean that that line item is only applicable, that option, if a dedicated circuit is required versus if it's not.
**Chris.query**: It's inclusive.
**Bclymer**: Correct.
**Bclymer**: It's included.
**Bclymer**: If we go to the building department, they say, no, you got to run all those exit lights on a dedicated circuit instead of, you know, typically your lights are right there and they just run a whip over.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And it's on the same circuit as all the lights.
**Bclymer**: So that's the adder if they tell.
**Bclymer**: No, you Got to wire those dedicated to their own circuit exit lights, then they would.
**Bclymer**: That's what they figured it would cost.
**Chris.query**: Okay, got it.
**Bclymer**: Got it.
**Chris.query**: Okay.
**Chris.query**: Okay.
**Chris.query**: That was my.
**Chris.query**: That, that helped to clarify that point for me.
**Chris.query**: Thanks.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: Oh, right now including everything will be.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: Do you say, was it 2.2 or the last one?
**Bclymer**: 2.078.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: Ah, because you read 2.0.
**Chris.query**: Okay, so.
**Chris.query**: So, so Hermes, where we are, it's 2 million 78.
**Chris.query**: If we need dedicated circuits for the exit signs, then it's another 98,000.
**Chris.query**: If we don't need dedicated circuits, then it's included in the 2 million 78.
**Chris.query**: And then if we only award Alito the portion of the just the lighting, then they're saying now that they're going to add 211,000 to it.
**Chris.query**: If we award them for the entire project, then the 211,000 would not be added.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: It would go away and then it would just be the whole thing.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Chris.query**: Okay.
**Chris.query**: I think this is what we needed, Jesse, to get clarity.
**Chris.query**: But I want to make sure that the rest of the team has all their questions.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Chris.query**: Answered.
**Bclymer**: And I got your plans, Jared.
**Bclymer**: Appreciate that.
**Bclymer**: I did want to confirm like at one point there was expanded bathrooms up at the MDF room kind of by it.
**Bclymer**: But there's existing bathrooms there.
**Bclymer**: So the current plan you sent those existing bathrooms just stay.
**Bclymer**: We're not adding that set of bathrooms.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: All right.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: Are you talking on north side or south side?
**Bclymer**: They're on the north side where the, you know, where the MDF room is.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: Yeah, well, all the.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: All the system bathrooms will stay there.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: We're no demoing any assistant bathrooms.
**Bclymer**: Okay, Well, I was just saying like there was that one type of plan.
**Bclymer**: I think maybe that was the bathroom set that wasn't coming up on the as built or something.
**Bclymer**: So you were just adding a bathroom there probably.
**Bclymer**: And then once you.
**Bclymer**: Once that existing was shown, then they just deleted that one.
**Bclymer**: But it was just a question.
**Bclymer**: I just wanted to confirm.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: I mean, I can.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: I got the autocad drawing open.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: If you want to.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: I can share.
**Chris.query**: Okay.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: This is the.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: This is the office complex and bathrooms on the north side.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And then the.
**Bclymer**: The new.
**Bclymer**: Your it closet room.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: Yeah, it's gonna be.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: It's gonna be.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: I think the MDF now is going to be changed somewhere here because we found out in the DMARC room is the first.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: This is the first.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: It is the first one.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: I think now the MDF is going to be somewhere.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: I think.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that's exactly, exactly where it's going to be.
**Bclymer**: Hey, Jared, do you like Hermes?
**Bclymer**: Do you have the.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that's a little bit older, right?
**Jdawson**: It's not.
**Jdawson**: It's not updated with a number of things.
**Jdawson**: But in terms of that restroom, I believe that's Dr.
**Jdawson**: 1 39.
**Jdawson**: And I'm opening my drawing real quick.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: I kind of.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: I can look for the other one, but I was just using it for something for the offices.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: But yeah, the new.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: The new MDF is gonna be in this location right here.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: Right there by the.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: The first electrical room.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So then at the other electrical room, then there is a new bathroom or.
**Bclymer**: No, that's just the.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: This was going to be the cage.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: You see, this won't be here.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: And this cage.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: This is all it will.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: It will move to the southeast corner.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And in its place is currently.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: See, these will be.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: Will be gone and these two.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: So still stay the way it is.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: There's no office or restroom there.
**Jdawson**: The office is by column lines 31, 32 and 33.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Up on the other end.
**Jdawson**: Just real quick for you, that is.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So Doc, where.
**Jdawson**: He's showing the restroom on the west side.
**Jdawson**: That drawing was wrong.
**Jdawson**: The restroom is physically over to the east.
**Jdawson**: One more dock door.
**Jdawson**: So that's.
**Jdawson**: The drawing that you have reflects what's physically in place.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: Think about this.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: Right here.
**Jdawson**: No, sir, on the other side.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: On here.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I think it's the one.
**Bclymer**: The electrical room on the east.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: Yeah, this is the electrical room of the east.
**Bclymer**: That's one on the east.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, go to the.
**Jdawson**: The west side is where I'm talking.
**Jdawson**: You're talking about that.
**Jdawson**: That restroom right there is physically over to the east.
**Jdawson**: One dock door.
**William.twickler**: Yeah.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: Is to be here and here.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So that's, that's.
**Jdawson**: I think the difference.
**Jdawson**: The other difference you're seeing in the drawing.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So it's not new.
**Jdawson**: It just.
**Jdawson**: It was in the wrong spot to begin with.
**William.twickler**: Hey, Bill, I think another thing we need to consider or find out from the landlord is the fire pump, because.
**William.twickler**: Yeah, that fire pump is probably 150 to 200amp.
**William.twickler**: Yeah, sometimes they run it off, you know, utility service or sometimes they'll bypass it.
**William.twickler**: But we need to find out if it's on the utility service because they.
**Bclymer**: Should be checking out or they make it.
**William.twickler**: If they run that at once a week like they're supposed to, it's going to pull pretty big load.
**Chris.query**: 100%.
**Chris.query**: Yeah.
**Chris.query**: Great call.
**Chris.query**: Yeah.
**Chris.query**: Okay.
**Chris.query**: I think if we don't have anything else.
**Bclymer**: One thing I did, you know, I don't know how we're adding all this employee parking in that lot.
**Bclymer**: You know, a lot of times parking lots will have a minimum candela of or, you know, minimum amount of lighting they need out there.
**Bclymer**: And that's something that we just need to put on the list of things to check and take.
**Bclymer**: I don't know what's out there, if that's adequate.
**Bclymer**: If it was just a big open turnaround.
**William.twickler**: There's lighting there.
**William.twickler**: I don't know if it's.
**William.twickler**: Usually parking lots are one foot candle stand.
**Chris.query**: Okay.
**William.twickler**: But there's a couple on the building.
**William.twickler**: Then there's a couple light poles out by that retention pond.
**Bclymer**: Okay, okay, maybe good then.
**Bclymer**: And then just last thing.
**Bclymer**: You know, some architects are more scared of this city permit than others, but we're definitely going to have to do some expediting on that end when it comes time to get the full permit for sure.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: Is that part of the $2 million including Expediter?
**Bclymer**: No, I think for electrical we can.
**Bclymer**: Well, again, like, you know, the electrician in the past, they pull what's called a at risk permit that they allows them to start their electrical work early.
**Bclymer**: So, you know, we can get started on that.
**Bclymer**: And then I just, I need to get in there and just see what the expedited fees cost, if that's an option.
**Bclymer**: Or then again, maybe where you can go in with the leverage of you bringing 500 jobs to their city in the next three months if they'll get you a permit.
**Bclymer**: And that can do a lot, but that usually takes someone going into the head of the department and making that.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: Case you got expedited fee that sometimes the city allow you to pay more, more, and they just kind of speed up the process.
**Jarrod.kimmey**: And I was talking more about to hire an expediter who really kind of have some kind of relationship already with the city and trying to get it, you know, process faster.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I've used expediters.
**Bclymer**: They've never really saved me any time.
**Bclymer**: They're more for saving the headache of managing the building departments.
**Bclymer**: You know, in other jurisdictions though, we expedite.
**Bclymer**: You know, they all love money.
**Bclymer**: And you pay them in Indiana, you pay them $5,000, you get a permit in a week.
**Bclymer**: And so we'll just have to see, you know, what are the, what is their ransom cost here in Arizona for it?
**William.twickler**: But you can start the demo of the lighting without the permit, right?
**Bclymer**: We have to have that at risk permit before we can do anything.
**Bclymer**: Okay, Yep.
**Bclymer**: But again, we'll, you know, once we get Released, we'll be able to be more involved with the city knowing that.
**Bclymer**: And again, we don't want to confuse things for them with 10 different people, tell them they got a job, you know, whoever is actually doing it, so.
**William.twickler**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And you know, now we got past this first rush.
**Bclymer**: I need to see.
**Bclymer**: I mean, we were still going to look and see what the time and cost of adding a service or you think we're going to have to just design this to not add a service or does that depend if, like you end up signing a 20 year lease for this building, then you'd want to add more service?
**Chris.query**: Yeah, that's the thing we don't have.
**Chris.query**: We have a short lease here.
**Chris.query**: I mean, short in our, in our view, you know, in.
**Chris.query**: So as a result of that, you know, trying, if, if we were going into this for 20 years, that's a different situation.
**Chris.query**: Could we be in it for 20 years?
**Chris.query**: Possibly.
**Chris.query**: But, you know, right now there's no, no commitment at that kind of level.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Jeff Bezos is signing his life away this weekend and he won't sign up for 20 years with you guys.
**Chris.query**: Yep, exactly.
**Chris.query**: What else, guys?
**Jarrod.kimmey**: I don't have anything else.
**Chris.query**: Okay, Jesse, I think we're good for the moment.
**Chris.query**: We may have a few more questions if you don't mind.
**Chris.query**: Maybe you can drop.
**Chris.query**: We probably have some things we need to.
**Chris.query**: We need to kind of like discuss internal.
**Chris.query**: If that's all right.
**Chris.query**: And.
**Bclymer**: Do you want me to.
**Bclymer**: It's getting late here.
**Bclymer**: Do you want me to tell the electrician.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Hit the ground running Monday with your permit drawings or.
**Chris.query**: I mean, I mean, we will circle back with you.
**Chris.query**: I mean, don't.
**Chris.query**: I'm not expecting that you're going to hear back from us still today.
**Chris.query**: It's so late.
**Chris.query**: But, you know, we'll circle back first thing Monday morning with you on some direction.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Chris.query**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: Appreciate it.
**Chris.query**: All right.
**Chris.query**: Thank you.
**Chris.query**: Appreciate all the work here.
**William.twickler**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: No problem.
**Bclymer**: Thanks, guys.
**Bclymer**: We'll see it.
**Chris.query**: Absolutely.
**Chris.query**: Hey, guys, let's.
**Chris.query**: I'm going to drop.
**Chris.query**: Let's drop in.
**Chris.query**: We'll set.
**Chris.query**: I'll send another meeting notice out because.
**Chris.query**: Let's just do that.
**Chris.query**: Thanks.
**William.twickler**: Okay.
