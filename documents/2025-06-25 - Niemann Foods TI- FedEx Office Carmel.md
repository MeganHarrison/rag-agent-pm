## Transcript
**Ataylor**: Sa Adriana.
**Blake.schneider**: Good morning, Alex.
**Ataylor**: How you doing?
**Blake.schneider**: I'm good.
**Blake.schneider**: How are you doing today?
**Ataylor**: I'm good.
**Ataylor**: I'm here right now.
**Blake.schneider**: Nice.
**Blake.schneider**: Nice.
**Blake.schneider**: It's still waiting on a permit.
**Ataylor**: Yep.
**Ataylor**: Okay, sure are.
**Ataylor**: I know AJ was getting comments back and Arch was responding to some of them, so there's at least some movement going on.
**Blake.schneider**: Nice.
**Blake.schneider**: Will AJ be on the call today?
**Ataylor**: I'm not sure.
**Ataylor**: I know he was out in Brownsburg with you guys this morning and then headed to Avon.
**Ataylor**: I know we need to get you the data tie in location.
**Blake.schneider**: Yes.
**Blake.schneider**: Yep, exactly.
**Blake.schneider**: So we're looking for our data tie in point and then I know we were.
**Blake.schneider**: We asked an RFI about the shut shutting down of the main gear, so we want to coordinate that and we were going to see when can we shut down, who needs to be made aware, etc.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: So I'll get with Sean and then AJ can get with the higher ups.
**Ataylor**: Sean's the store manager.
**Ataylor**: That's who I've been dealing with.
**Ataylor**: But yeah, we'll definitely need to coordinate.
**Blake.schneider**: Yeah, that sounds good.
**Ataylor**: Food and all that stuff, so.
**Blake.schneider**: Yes, sir.
**Blake.schneider**: The other.
**Blake.schneider**: The other two questions that I had kind of directed towards.
**Blake.schneider**: Towards AJ is I know he mentioned that the FedEx electricians are going to be taking on some of this scope of work, and I was hoping we could get a scope sheet from them so we know exactly where our scope ends and theirs begins.
**Ataylor**: Yes.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, we were gonna be.
**Ataylor**: We were gonna come in after and hook up their equipment, but now we're just doing junction boxes and they'll come hook into it, so.
**Blake.schneider**: Yep.
**Blake.schneider**: Yep.
**Blake.schneider**: And then the last thing.
**Blake.schneider**: I think most of our submittals are approved.
**Blake.schneider**: We're just still waiting on fire alarm.
**Blake.schneider**: But as soon as we get the okay on that, we'll get that ordered.
**Blake.schneider**: It's not a lot.
**Blake.schneider**: It was just a few devices.
**Brianj**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: I can't imagine it being too much.
**Ataylor**: It's not a big space.
**Blake.schneider**: Correct.
**Blake.schneider**: And there's existing already as well.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: Do you need any information on the panel or the monitoring company?
**Blake.schneider**: No.
**Blake.schneider**: Nope.
**Blake.schneider**: I think we got Adco, I believe.
**Blake.schneider**: Yeah.
**Blake.schneider**: It's their system in there.
**Ataylor**: I've worked with them before.
**Ataylor**: Blake, are you in here?
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: How's it going?
**Ataylor**: It's going.
**Ataylor**: How are you?
**Jdawson**: Not too bad.
**Ataylor**: You still need the riser detail?
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: Riser detail.
**Jdawson**: Or as built it should.
**Jdawson**: It would be on as built if you had existing sprinkler drawings, but if not, I need riser detail, you know, and.
**Jdawson**: And location of where that riser's at.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: There's some old drawings sitting over in one of the corners.
**Ataylor**: I'll take a look at those here in a second.
**Brianj**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Hopefully there's some.
**Jdawson**: If I need to swing by there, I can get all the riser detail, pipe sizes, all that for existing if needed.
**Ataylor**: Just.
**Jdawson**: I just need to know when I can get over there.
**Ataylor**: Okay, I'm here right now, so I'll head in and get those pictures for you.
**Jdawson**: Copy that.
**Ataylor**: And then for applied, I know you're.
**Ataylor**: You're needing those CAD drawings I got with AJ on that, so.
**Jdawson**: Okay, perfect.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: And then.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, say same thing.
**Jdawson**: If we have as built for that, that'd be helpful to know what, you know, existing outlet size and stuff we're working with for adding flexes and things like that.
**Ataylor**: You're late, Tim.
**Brianj**: Because teams is dumb.
**Brianj**: They don't.
**Brianj**: The app doesn't work on my phone.
**Brianj**: Very good.
**Ataylor**: Oh, you're fine.
**Ataylor**: Well, you missed everything.
**Ataylor**: That joint I just talked about said we get the data, tie in point and then waiting on fire alarm.
**Ataylor**: Where are you at right now, Tim?
**Ataylor**: Are you going to be by here at all today?
**Brianj**: Probably a little later in the day.
**Ataylor**: Okay, I'm here now.
**Ataylor**: So see how the guys are doing if they need anything.
**Ataylor**: Still waiting on the permit, but there is movement going on.
**Ataylor**: And just so everybody else knows, I got the steel for the doors and windows that'll be here Friday.
**Ataylor**: They're going to deliver it, and then we'll get it installed.
**Ataylor**: And then as soon as we get the okay with the permit, we're going to start cutting openings.
**Ataylor**: This one's short and sweet.
**Ataylor**: Everybody else I've kind of spoken to on the side.
**Ataylor**: Anybody else got anything for me?
**Brianj**: Everyone else, as in Joanna and I as Joanna Blake.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Brianj**: Oh, okay.
**Ataylor**: My frame.
**Ataylor**: My framer, he's ready to go as soon as we get the openings cut.
**Ataylor**: Plumber's good to go.
**Ataylor**: H Vac is good to go.
**Ataylor**: Roofer is good to go.
**Ataylor**: Steel guy's good to go, and my concrete cutter is good to go, so.
**Brianj**: Well.
**Ataylor**: I'll leave it at that for this week.
**Ataylor**: Thanks, Alex.
**Ataylor**: Thanks, everybody.
**Brianj**: Bye.
**Ataylor**: Bye.
