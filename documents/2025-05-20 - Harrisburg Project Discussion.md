## Transcript
**Sam_uhlman**: Hello.
**Speaker 1**: Hey, Sam, how are you?
**Sam_uhlman**: I'm good.
**Sam_uhlman**: How are you guys doing?
**Speaker 1**: Doing well, doing well.
**Speaker 1**: Glad to see both sporting the Nike pillows.
**Sam_uhlman**: Yeah, it's good.
**Sam_uhlman**: Oh, so this is a, this is an AI note taker.
**Sam_uhlman**: I like that, man.
**Speaker 1**: I tell you what, it's a game changer.
**Speaker 1**: Like it allows you to be present during meetings and I mean literally.
**Speaker 1**: I actually just had, it was funny, I had a, a client reach out to me today, actually said, hey, why don't you guys have anybody on site?
**Speaker 1**: And I said, because you asked us to push back two weeks.
**Speaker 1**: Like what?
**Speaker 1**: I said, hear the notes.
**Speaker 1**: You said it right?
**Speaker 1**: We talked about it last week.
**Sam_uhlman**: That's awesome.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Sam_uhlman**: Fireflies.
**Sam_uhlman**: You may have inspired me to, to look into some of this stuff.
**Sam_uhlman**: You know, it's, it's start utilizing AI or get swallowed by it.
**Sam_uhlman**: One of the two.
**Speaker 1**: In, in five years there will be two types of businesses.
**Speaker 1**: Those that utilize AI and those that are out of business.
**Sam_uhlman**: Yeah.
**Sam_uhlman**: Yep.
**Speaker 1**: So yeah, you can check out, you know, so I, you know, we use Fireflies, you know, for our whole company.
**Speaker 1**: Everybody has it.
**Speaker 1**: But you can use like Otter is another one.
**Speaker 1**: Read those.
**Speaker 1**: Both pretty good.
**Speaker 1**: So.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, yeah, read AI and Otter.
**Speaker 1**: AI are two popular ones.
**Sam_uhlman**: Otter spirit spelled like the animal.
**Speaker 1**: Ott.
**Speaker 1**: Yep.
**Sam_uhlman**: Okay, I'm gonna check that out.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, and it's, it's super powerful.
**Speaker 1**: Like, so I've got this, we've got this development down in Mesa, Arizona and the, you know, our, our development partner, he said, hey, would you take the lead on this?
**Speaker 1**: Like, and we kind of had, we had a call, you know, kind of going over all the details of what they want.
**Speaker 1**: This, that and the other.
**Speaker 1**: And so I took that transcript, put it into ChatGPT and it had it make me call notes of key points.
**Sam_uhlman**: Yeah.
**Sam_uhlman**: That's awesome.
**Sam_uhlman**: That's awesome.
**Sam_uhlman**: Well, I know I'll, I'll get things kicked off here with kind of the reason for reaching out.
**Sam_uhlman**: And what I'd like to do is kind of, kind of get an idea for what scope your company could help us out with as of right now.
**Sam_uhlman**: You know, we work with the Harrington group to provide us with essentially the hazardous materials reports for our sites.
**Sam_uhlman**: And along with that comes the construction requirements that they deem necessary in order to handle our goods in the way that we expect them to.
**Speaker 1**: So their, their code analysis, they give you a write up that says boom, boom, boom.
**Speaker 1**: Right, exactly.
**Sam_uhlman**: It's like, you know, fire rated walls up to one hour drop ceiling, this type of fire suppression, et cetera, where you Know, we, we've been lacking on the speed side.
**Sam_uhlman**: I mean given I've only been here three months.
**Sam_uhlman**: So from what I can tell in my broader activation team, I'm the oldest of the, of the group of four, you know, so we're moving at a rap.
**Speaker 1**: You don't look that old.
**Speaker 1**: You look at my age.
**Sam_uhlman**: Yeah.
**Sam_uhlman**: Or, sorry, I'm the most tenured of the four.
**Speaker 1**: Gotcha.
**Speaker 1**: Gotcha.
**Sam_uhlman**: I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm in contention for the oldest in age.
**Sam_uhlman**: But you know, but that being said, you know, from, from my three months of experience, we're moving a little too slow on the HAZMAT side.
**Sam_uhlman**: And I think a lot of that comes from the reservations of trying to allocate a HAZMAT aerosol solution that involves this high robotic like AMR system.
**Sam_uhlman**: Yeah.
**Sam_uhlman**: And so it will not even, you know, not the broader ASR, ASRs, more just like we're really just thinking like shelf movers and, and just bots that come in and pick things up and take it out and that's it.
**Speaker 1**: Like a geek plus system or something.
**Sam_uhlman**: Yeah, exactly.
**Sam_uhlman**: So it's that it's your brightpick is someone else that we work with that we coordinate with on that.
**Sam_uhlman**: But anyway, what I can share with you is kind of a broad overview of what we're looking to do.
**Sam_uhlman**: And what I'd like to understand is if you're, if your team could fill in that scope with construction requirements or you know, seeking transparency as well.
**Sam_uhlman**: If this is something like, hey, this hasn't been done before, you know, kind of scares me away or you know, other design levers that we can pull to make it functional.
**Sam_uhlman**: So let me, let me pull up at least a layout here so you can see what we're, what we're talking about.
**Sam_uhlman**: Now does your, your Fireflies note taker here, does it take like screen grabs as well?
**Speaker 1**: It's recording the whole thing so you can watch the whole video.
**Sam_uhlman**: Oh, okay.
**Sam_uhlman**: Got it.
**Speaker 1**: Yep.
**Sam_uhlman**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Sam_uhlman**: Video cautious with what I share.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, video is super powerful.
**Speaker 1**: We, you know, I do like we.
**Speaker 1**: Another thing I, we use loom a lot, which is like a video recording.
**Speaker 1**: And so I'll do a screen share and I'll explain like proposals or like drawings and all that stuff and send it to clients or whoever.
**Speaker 1**: Like whoever.
**Speaker 1**: It just beats the hell out of an email with screenshots.
**Sam_uhlman**: Yeah.
**Sam_uhlman**: Yeah, man, you're selling me more and more, you know, Don.
**Speaker 1**: Ya.
**Sam_uhlman**: Okay, so without, you know, exposing too much of our design here, so what we're looking at is the warehouse space where up here is an office area.
**Sam_uhlman**: This is a maintenance cage.
**Sam_uhlman**: This is your robotic, you know, ASRs stuff.
**Sam_uhlman**: Well, sorry, this wouldn't really be ASRs as much as it would be just like AMRS and like Shelf Movers.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Sam_uhlman**: And then the same.
**Sam_uhlman**: What's that?
**Speaker 1**: I said, yeah, they look like just bins or two.
**Speaker 1**: They're not.
**Speaker 1**: It's not convincing for ASR.
**Sam_uhlman**: Yeah.
**Sam_uhlman**: So more like your Geek plus Kiva Brightpick style.
**Sam_uhlman**: And so the intent would be to have that same thing in what you see here.
**Sam_uhlman**: Here we go.
**Sam_uhlman**: Some aerosol storage in this cage.
**Sam_uhlman**: And then here's your 15,000 square foot hazmat room.
**Sam_uhlman**: The aerosol cage would be about 4,000.
**Sam_uhlman**: So that's where we're situated inside the building.
**Sam_uhlman**: I'm now going to bring up, for what it's worth, a more realistic kind of layout of what that could look like here.
**Sam_uhlman**: See, there we go.
**Sam_uhlman**: So zooming into just that aerosol and the Hazmat space.
**Sam_uhlman**: This is more or less what I would expect the pod layout to look like.
**Sam_uhlman**: It's a little more dense than what you saw on the screen, just utilizing the perimeter.
**Sam_uhlman**: But so.
**Sam_uhlman**: And here's where I think, like the Harrington group kind of gets held up, is asking a lot more questions on like, what do these robots, like, what are they rated for?
**Sam_uhlman**: Like, the types of questions that aren't even really just about storage anymore.
**Sam_uhlman**: And so I guess first question is like, have you.
**Sam_uhlman**: Have you guys provided anything like this in the past?
**Speaker 1**: So we've done a ton of the storage arrangements that you're talking about where you've got full high aerosol fencing and then you've got your Hazmat storage.
**Speaker 1**: I've never.
**Speaker 1**: I'm trying to think.
**Speaker 1**: I say never.
**Speaker 1**: I mean, I've done so many of these, I have to try to remember.
**Speaker 1**: I'm not sure if I've ever done one with a Geek plus system inside it.
**Speaker 1**: I think it's typically always been static rack.
**Sam_uhlman**: Okay.
**Sam_uhlman**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: How tall are those?
**Speaker 1**: Eight foot, six foot.
**Sam_uhlman**: Yeah, I'd say eight foot max.
**Sam_uhlman**: You know, we haven't really even defined that.
**Sam_uhlman**: Let me see if I have this.
**Sam_uhlman**: Perfect.
**Sam_uhlman**: All right, so this is what we're looking at.
**Speaker 1**: Back, back to that.
**Speaker 1**: To that.
**Speaker 1**: Hazmat is your operation.
**Speaker 1**: Well, the.
**Speaker 1**: With those robots, take those outside that door.
**Sam_uhlman**: So that, that's one of kind of the.
**Sam_uhlman**: The main questions on at hand here is do they need to be completely isolated?
**Sam_uhlman**: I.
**Sam_uhlman**: I think if they need to be completely isolated, you know that that requires additional workstations, isolated bots, isolated chargers.
**Sam_uhlman**: It may squish the need to have this be automated.
**Sam_uhlman**: It may push us more towards a manual solution.
**Speaker 1**: So traditionally, and this is, I'm, I, I don't think I've designed one of these personally that I can remember, but I can tell you what I would do and what I think the municipality would want.
**Speaker 1**: So, typically, any automation in a warehouse operation, the biggest thing is that, like when you have conveyors, ASRs, any of that stuff, if you, if there's a fire somewhere, they want it to shut down when the alarm trips.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Because that means that the, you know, otherwise you've got a tote that's on fire that gets picked and moved and it just spreads it.
**Speaker 1**: So having the robots going in and out, I don't think would be an issue.
**Speaker 1**: I mean, think about if you had a conveyor that went through there and then you just have a fire shutter.
**Speaker 1**: And so in case of fire, conveyor stops, fire shutter drops.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, but the biggest thing is you have to have, I would say probably those robots somehow tied in to where they drop the firearm, which I think Geek plus has that with their control panel to where it's just a contact and it will immediately do a stop.
**Sam_uhlman**: Yeah, yeah.
**Sam_uhlman**: And we've already started talking about that with, you know, one of the AMR providers for, for another site that we're doing is what does the fire plan look like?
**Sam_uhlman**: And to your point, it's like we're developing that standard or that game plan now.
**Sam_uhlman**: We like, we want all bots out of any walkways, out of any aisles, so that if someone is in there, you know, even though it's a small percentage, you know, probability that someone's even in there during an event like that, they can get out.
**Speaker 1**: So do you have.
**Speaker 1**: So this is obviously this area it's not meant for people to be in.
**Speaker 1**: Correct.
**Sam_uhlman**: It would not be.
**Speaker 1**: So the one thing I would say that and I.
**Speaker 1**: Unless you had a certain geofence, which that's not what it's going to look like if you go to your other one.
**Speaker 1**: That, that's your layout.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Speaker 1**: Because this one doesn't show up as the walls.
**Sam_uhlman**: This would say that one more time because it's in the corner of the building.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Speaker 1**: But I mean, the layout that you showed me before had the totes along the wall.
**Speaker 1**: That doesn't.
**Sam_uhlman**: Oh, I see.
**Sam_uhlman**: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Sam_uhlman**: Let me pull up.
**Speaker 1**: Which, I mean, is it going to be that one or is it that one?
**Sam_uhlman**: This is More the kind of pod layout I would envision.
**Sam_uhlman**: There's a small gap between the red.
**Speaker 1**: Measurements of those corridors there.
**Sam_uhlman**: Let's see if I can zoom in.
**Speaker 1**: Should be at the.
**Speaker 1**: But, yeah, there you go.
**Sam_uhlman**: Five foot six.
**Speaker 1**: Seven.
**Speaker 1**: Five, six, seven.
**Speaker 1**: Scroll down a little bit.
**Sam_uhlman**: Five foot six is the most narrow.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I mean, I would.
**Speaker 1**: I, I think that you, you.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, that's good.
**Speaker 1**: So my thought was if I like dealing with these.
**Speaker 1**: So we did a.
**Speaker 1**: An adverb system that was similar to this earlier this year.
**Speaker 1**: Taylor.
**Speaker 1**: Last year.
**Speaker 1**: This year.
**Speaker 1**: Anyway.
**Speaker 1**: And the biggest thing was they had a big open robot area outside the ASRs.
**Speaker 1**: And so anytime that somebody went in there for maintenance, they basically had to like, do a shutdown so the robots didn't move.
**Speaker 1**: And we had to have like an operational and everything like that.
**Speaker 1**: I would suspect, and that they would want the same thing for this.
**Speaker 1**: So the robots can be moving and everything, but anytime that somebody is going to go in a person, they have to.
**Speaker 1**: They can't be moving because if something happens, they could be blocked in.
**Speaker 1**: I think that's where you.
**Speaker 1**: That's.
**Speaker 1**: I think that's where you would get a lot of pushback.
**Speaker 1**: So you'd have to have a.
**Speaker 1**: Hey, you know, this is.
**Speaker 1**: Anytime that a maintenance staff come in here, you know, these robots are shut down.
**Sam_uhlman**: Yeah.
**Sam_uhlman**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: I think that would be a sticking point and I would go ahead and have an operation typed up, showing like, you know, pictures, and here's the operation for maintenance so that it's, you know.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, submit that with the packet.
**Sam_uhlman**: Okay.
**Sam_uhlman**: And what about, like, from a storage perspective?
**Sam_uhlman**: I wouldn't, I wouldn't envision this being any different than like a manual static shelf.
**Sam_uhlman**: And obviously, because we're keeping it, you know, level one only, you know, eight feet maximum, we'll call it.
**Sam_uhlman**: You know, you can obviously do the drop ceiling, whatever you would require in that space.
**Sam_uhlman**: And, and we, we have flexibility to even design the pod solution, you know, however we want to design that as well.
**Sam_uhlman**: The product is kind of what we see in the, like, any kind of like, proposal.
**Sam_uhlman**: Like these can be metal.
**Sam_uhlman**: We can have drainage holes.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, you'll definitely, you'll definitely have to have adequately vented, perforated.
**Speaker 1**: Now, is any of the stuff that you're storing in there?
**Speaker 1**: Is it flammable liquid or what is it?
**Speaker 1**: Exactly.
**Sam_uhlman**: Yeah.
**Sam_uhlman**: So that's where.
**Sam_uhlman**: If you look at our summary table here, it, you know, it would not include combustible liquids.
**Sam_uhlman**: Class 3B.
**Speaker 1**: What we're really looking at, 128,000 gallons.
**Sam_uhlman**: 128,000 gallons.
**Sam_uhlman**: But that would not be in the hazmat area.
**Sam_uhlman**: Those are things that would be, could be stored over in like the High Bay area.
**Sam_uhlman**: We'll have baffling and fire suppression.
**Sam_uhlman**: Well, I guess we can get more to that in a minute here.
**Sam_uhlman**: Anything that you see kind of labeled as has over here, you know, we've got rust treatment, sealants, waxes, polishes, tire cleaners, things of that nature.
**Sam_uhlman**: Adhesive.
**Sam_uhlman**: That's class 3B.
**Sam_uhlman**: I guess I, I listed some of these things of Class 3B, which to my understanding, we can have out in the main area.
**Sam_uhlman**: We're just limited to overall quantities.
**Sam_uhlman**: But there are some flammable things in here, you know, like freon fusee, engine flush, fuel conditioner.
**Sam_uhlman**: So all the cleaners, that type of thing.
**Speaker 1**: So, but you're not going to have any of that liquid in that storage room.
**Sam_uhlman**: So all if it does not say 3B, it would be in this Hazmat storage room.
**Sam_uhlman**: So, like all of these items right here, I'll, I'll kind of highlight to give you a better idea here.
**Sam_uhlman**: So, like, that would be in the storage room that we'd look to have in there.
**Sam_uhlman**: Engine flush.
**Sam_uhlman**: Have you, have you all this stuff, right?
**Speaker 1**: And so you obviously know what's, you know, what's water missable and what's not and everything.
**Sam_uhlman**: So what, what additional info would we need here?
**Speaker 1**: So one, couple things.
**Speaker 1**: And, and again, typically it's always static wreck.
**Speaker 1**: You don't have this issue.
**Speaker 1**: The only thing I would see with having liquid now I'm looking at what the containers are.
**Speaker 1**: They're all metal and plastic.
**Speaker 1**: So it may not be a big deal, but right now, the shelving that you just showed me does not have any vertical barriers.
**Speaker 1**: And so those robots moving, if I'm a fire marshal, I'm saying, what if they hit each other and they knock over now you've just spilled hazardous liquid on the floor.
**Speaker 1**: And so, okay, that, that would be a, I think a concern that I would have if I were a fire marshal looking at this now, the rebuttal might be like, dude, they're plastic containers.
**Speaker 1**: It's like, all right, well, have you done a fall test at 8 foot to see what that does?
**Speaker 1**: Right?
**Speaker 1**: Because I mean, can it, can a plastic container crack at 8 foot?
**Speaker 1**: You know, you know, 10.9 GS, it's going what, 10 mile an hour when it hit something like that?
**Speaker 1**: Like.
**Sam_uhlman**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: But that would be my thought there, because that's moving and there obviously, you know, that's the risk of the accidents.
**Sam_uhlman**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: You know, even if it's as simple as simple as like bungee cords or something around it, I think would be something that you would need to have to, to prevent that.
**Speaker 1**: That would be, that would just be.
**Speaker 1**: I'm not saying it is, but that would be an objection that I would expect to see in that operation.
**Sam_uhlman**: Yeah.
**Sam_uhlman**: Okay, that's, that's good feedback.
**Speaker 1**: And then so, and then your, your code analysis team should have already done this.
**Speaker 1**: So when you talk about flammable hazardous liquids, there's stuff that's missable and not you aware of that.
**Sam_uhlman**: Assume no.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: So water missile means that it mixes with the water and versus like oil like it sits on top.
**Sam_uhlman**: Got it.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, so that's a big deal because if there is a fire in there, how do you fight?
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Sam_uhlman**: Is what is water going to put it out?
**Sam_uhlman**: Basically?
**Speaker 1**: Not, not so much that it's, that is, if it's on fire and we put water in it, is it just mixing in there or is it all floating on top?
**Speaker 1**: And then so you're going to look at a phone system and so what we've done before in the past, like we, we did one of these.
**Speaker 1**: I did one of these.
**Speaker 1**: Now granted it was static rack and we actually, we built a three hour fire barrier basically match the exterior wall and actually removed the sprinkler system and put a leak detection system in because water on it wouldn't do any good.
**Speaker 1**: It's better for it to just sit there and then it's isolated to that one spot.
**Speaker 1**: Versus like if you had, you know, water pulling up and then oil is on fire on top of it, spreading around everywhere.
**Sam_uhlman**: Got it.
**Sam_uhlman**: And you're, what type of, what type of detection system was that?
**Speaker 1**: It's just a week.
**Speaker 1**: I don't, I don't, I don't remember the brand.
**Speaker 1**: But it's elite detection system.
**Speaker 1**: So, so elite detection system is.
**Speaker 1**: I mean it's exactly what it sounds like.
**Speaker 1**: So it's just, you know, if you know, something hits over a certain, you know, surface area, it triggers an alarm, you know, drops it and ties into the alarm system to, you know, call the fire marshal or the fire.
**Speaker 1**: I'm not saying you have to have a leak detection system in this one.
**Speaker 1**: I, I don't know the, I don't know the makeup of what you got.
**Speaker 1**: Just in the little bit that I read, I think you have oil, right?
**Sam_uhlman**: Like we've got a.
**Sam_uhlman**: Well actually, yeah.
**Sam_uhlman**: Of some variety.
**Sam_uhlman**: We should like motor oil and things like that could go like in the High Bay area.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: You see you got motor oil all high bay.
**Speaker 1**: High bay.
**Speaker 1**: High bay.
**Sam_uhlman**: Yeah.
**Sam_uhlman**: But it's like oil additive, fuel additives.
**Sam_uhlman**: So I mean, yeah, there's going to be oils in here.
**Speaker 1**: And so the thing is like, and, and this is where it gets out of my expertise a little bit.
**Speaker 1**: And you know, I just have, obviously just looking at this here, it, it also comes down to the amounts and you know, again, your, your code people should look at that and say, oh wait, we're under this threshold, so you're fine.
**Sam_uhlman**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: But in theory, the only difference with this room and setup versus any other one is that you're doing robots that move shelving versus static rack.
**Sam_uhlman**: Right.
**Speaker 1**: As far as that goes, those two things, you know, that it, it like you know, three things really.
**Speaker 1**: It shuts down in case of alarm of some sort.
**Sam_uhlman**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: I would, I would think that you probably need to have something that prevents like in case they crash, like prevents containers falling on the floor and breaking.
**Speaker 1**: And then a plan for when maintenance staff go in there that you know, the robots can't move or whatever that, that lockout tag out fail proof system is.
**Sam_uhlman**: Yeah, okay.
**Sam_uhlman**: Okay.
**Sam_uhlman**: And now basically, I mean, I can't.
**Speaker 1**: Point to a code or anything for any of those three.
**Speaker 1**: I'm simply speaking from my expertise in the industry and what I would see a fire marshal asking the question, because remember these guys, at the end of the day the HJ can, can go above and beyond and the only, you know, if he says, hey, I want xyz, you either comply or you go appeal to the state fire marshal.
**Speaker 1**: You know.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, typically you're going to apply unless it's just crazy.
**Speaker 1**: But those, if he asked for those three things, I don't think any of those are unreasonable by any means.
**Sam_uhlman**: Yeah.
**Sam_uhlman**: Okay.
**Sam_uhlman**: The other question is, do you, looking at this type of solution, do you, do you believe it needs to be isolated from the rest of the site?
**Speaker 1**: The hazardous room?
**Sam_uhlman**: Yeah.
**Sam_uhlman**: Like as in could we share bots and like do we need to have separate, you know, stations to stock and pick from this area and keep everything contained within this area?
**Sam_uhlman**: Or can we have those bots, the same bots that allow you to shift over to this one.
**Sam_uhlman**: The same bots that, you know, allow you to pick and stock from outside your robotic field over here could be utilized.
**Sam_uhlman**: Those same bots to go through a dedicated kind of bottom bot, access way into this hazmat space, pick up a shelf, bring it out, have them pick from it, then go put it back.
**Speaker 1**: So the bots interchanging.
**Speaker 1**: I don't see an issue.
**Speaker 1**: What I hear, what I equate that to, is you have two options in any warehouse operation.
**Speaker 1**: Do it by man, you know, person, or do it by robot.
**Speaker 1**: There's the only two options you have, automation or manual.
**Speaker 1**: If it were manual, you would have a person go in there, grab a product, go out to where it is, and, hey, I ordered motor oil and fuel additive and this and this.
**Speaker 1**: Put it all together, put in a box, ship it, or you're sending it to a store, whatever it is that you do.
**Speaker 1**: But either way, it would go out of that room, into an area and then off to the next thing.
**Speaker 1**: A robot is doing the same thing, in my opinion.
**Speaker 1**: So if I were, you know, if we were working on this and, you know, I'm meeting with the city, this, that's how I would present it.
**Speaker 1**: Like all robots do are replace manpower.
**Speaker 1**: It's the exact same operation whether I walk in there and get it or a robot does.
**Speaker 1**: And so as long as they're not taking that and dropping it outside and it stays there, it shouldn't be an issue.
**Speaker 1**: They're just picking up a shelf, saying, here you go, and then taking it back in there.
**Speaker 1**: I mean, just like I would do.
**Sam_uhlman**: Okay, yeah, I, I mean, I.
**Sam_uhlman**: For what it's worth, you're thinking about it like the exact same way that we are.
**Sam_uhlman**: You know, we're trying to compare it to the manual alternative.
**Sam_uhlman**: What is your.
**Sam_uhlman**: I know all hjs kind of treat some of this stuff differently.
**Sam_uhlman**: Looking at this site, which is, I believe it's Manchester, Pennsylvania, but it's outside of Harrisburg.
**Sam_uhlman**: What, what is our confidence level that we could get something like this through the eyes of the local jurisdiction?
**Sam_uhlman**: And then what is.
**Sam_uhlman**: You know, obviously if we have to fall back to a manual solution, it looks quite a bit different.
**Sam_uhlman**: There's a longer lead time on some of the materials that we would look to.
**Sam_uhlman**: To get.
**Sam_uhlman**: So I'm, I'm trying to think in terms of like a plan B.
**Sam_uhlman**: If the HJ doesn't see it that way, you know, and be like, no, we just can't allow this.
**Sam_uhlman**: How quickly could we know that?
**Speaker 1**: Hold on, I'm getting on the website.
**Speaker 1**: And is it Manchester Borough?
**Sam_uhlman**: Let me see.
**Speaker 1**: Here we go.
**Speaker 1**: Building permits, Town of Manchester, Pennsylvania.
**Sam_uhlman**: Sorry, it's, it's.
**Sam_uhlman**: My apologies.
**Sam_uhlman**: Not Manchester, it's Mannheim.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, okay.
**Speaker 1**: That's why I was having such a hard time.
**Speaker 1**: M A n what?
**Sam_uhlman**: M A n H E I M.
**Speaker 1**: Manheim Township.
**Sam_uhlman**: That's it.
**Speaker 1**: Sorry, bear with me.
**Sam_uhlman**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: So there's a lot of municipalities in that area and Pennsylvania that they use third party reviewers and I'm trying to see if they use the same one that they used in.
**Speaker 1**: We did we doing a job in Burnville and.
**Sam_uhlman**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: We just, we did one in Allentown and Easton and it was all the same one.
**Speaker 1**: So I'm just double checking.
**Sam_uhlman**: Yeah.
**Sam_uhlman**: Nice.
**Speaker 1**: All right, so it looks like they, they do do their own.
**Speaker 1**: They not, they don't outsource it.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So as far as getting it through the city, I mean, so you're asking me how, like how far down the road you have to go before you have an answer?
**Sam_uhlman**: Yeah, like if, if we said, I mean as of right now.
**Sam_uhlman**: Right.
**Sam_uhlman**: Like our design direction is, you know, we want this whole hazmat area and aerosol cage to be automated.
**Sam_uhlman**: Right.
**Sam_uhlman**: In the event that we don't get that cleared through the AHJ or if the fire marshal has issues with it where then, you know, it no longer makes sense to automate it.
**Sam_uhlman**: The manual solution looks quite a bit different.
**Sam_uhlman**: You know, I'd look to go a little bit higher with the solution, you know, in, in the form of racking.
**Sam_uhlman**: Yeah.
**Sam_uhlman**: You know, maybe not a, not a multiple level pic mod per se, but kind of like your library style shelving and high bay pallet rack.
**Speaker 1**: And so I'm assuming that you need the answer so you know what to order.
**Sam_uhlman**: Exactly.
**Sam_uhlman**: It's like I don't want to get down to, you know, three months before this building goes live and then we figure out, you know, hey, this, the, the fire marshal has, you know, severe issues with this because then by that point, like, I assume like the, I mean the construction of the room for starters, you know, it's like we would want it taller in a manual solution, your fire suppression system.
**Speaker 1**: What do you mean the room's gonna, I mean whether either one you do, you're gonna have the same, same size.
**Sam_uhlman**: Room, including like a drop ceiling.
**Speaker 1**: Why would you do a drop ceiling?
**Sam_uhlman**: If we have to, I would assume that we would want better because this is a 40 foot clear building and like to get to 8 foot tall pods, I assume we'd have to drop, drop a ceiling or drop some sort of suppression.
**Speaker 1**: I, I, you're 8 foot, so you got 32ft.
**Speaker 1**: I can't, I'd have to look and see what the, I can't, I can't remember if it's 20ft or 30ft of space that you can have between the heads.
**Speaker 1**: So you might have to.
**Speaker 1**: You might not have to.
**Speaker 1**: I don't know.
**Sam_uhlman**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: I mean a 40 foot clear building.
**Speaker 1**: Those have like K 25.2s ESFR system.
**Speaker 1**: I mean it's going to put out some juice.
**Sam_uhlman**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, so maybe I, I don't know off the top of my head, I would need to double check that.
**Speaker 1**: But yeah, I mean, so to answer your question, I mean when, when do you need to, to know, buy in order so you can order your material and get like when do you need to be operational?
**Speaker 1**: Do you have a go live date?
**Sam_uhlman**: Yeah, operational would be, let's see.
**Sam_uhlman**: So I mean we're talking November of next year.
**Speaker 1**: Oh.
**Sam_uhlman**: But in terms of.
**Sam_uhlman**: Yes, we've got time.
**Sam_uhlman**: But really what we're up against right now is, you know, we're currently trying to sign the lease for this building.
**Sam_uhlman**: We're trying to go out for permitting like as soon as we get the lease signed.
**Sam_uhlman**: And so it's when it's the permitting aspect that I'm chasing right now.
**Speaker 1**: When you get the lease signed later.
**Sam_uhlman**: This month, say that, let's assume late.
**Speaker 1**: June you have an loi.
**Sam_uhlman**: We've got the loi.
**Sam_uhlman**: I mean that was, that was done earlier in January.
**Speaker 1**: I mean, I guess my thought would be, I mean, have you guys spent any money on a code analysis yet?
**Sam_uhlman**: We've, I mean we've got Harrington Group kind of involved in it, but like I said, I'd be willing to pay for an additional party to do it faster.
**Speaker 1**: I, so I, I'll be honest, I am not a code specialist.
**Speaker 1**: I couldn't do what they do.
**Speaker 1**: I'm not an engineer.
**Speaker 1**: I know I was, you know, a stamp.
**Speaker 1**: Those guys are highly, highly special.
**Speaker 1**: I could figure it out, but you don't want that.
**Speaker 1**: You need somebody who's going to look at it.
**Speaker 1**: Exactly.
**Speaker 1**: So yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Now I could, you know, recommend some people that we work with.
**Speaker 1**: But as far as me actually doing that code analysis and saying yeah, you can have this much volume, everything it, you know, we, we stick to what we're really good at.
**Speaker 1**: And I'm not going to act like we're, that's something that we do every day.
**Sam_uhlman**: So what is it?
**Sam_uhlman**: What kind of, what, what is the kind of all inclusive scope from you guys?
**Speaker 1**: So, so our company, so we're, we're a commercial design build firm.
**Speaker 1**: So we build these warehouses from the ground up and inside and out all the way across the country with that.
**Speaker 1**: What we've done is we kind of created a niche market where we come in and do all the Infrastructure for all the mhe.
**Speaker 1**: So that's why high tech, we've worked with them on a ton of these buildings where a tenant like yourself comes in and oftentimes when you have a MHE solution integrator, like a high tech, they come in and they're going to give you your, you know, this many picks an hour and they're going to heal your numbers and everything, but they're going to say, look, you got to take care of getting us power sometimes permits reinforcement sprinkler anything and everything that we don't do, which means it usually falls to a facility guy or somebody who doesn't do it every day.
**Speaker 1**: And then they get somebody but then nobody's pushing them.
**Speaker 1**: They don't know what they don't know.
**Speaker 1**: And so then they delay the integrator and then in turn delays the project and pisses off the CEO because he doesn't care.
**Speaker 1**: He just wants his good live date.
**Speaker 1**: So what we do is we've paired with them and do exactly everything that they don't and drive the schedule.
**Sam_uhlman**: Got it.
**Speaker 1**: And so we also, the reason I know so much about sprinklers because we brought that in house.
**Speaker 1**: So we just, we were doing so many of these that it just made sense and so we just, we brought it in house.
**Sam_uhlman**: Okay.
**Sam_uhlman**: And so I know, I mean starting from what point, what point where for the, for the sprinklers, like is, is it like in, in terms of like a tote ASRs.
**Sam_uhlman**: Right.
**Sam_uhlman**: So let's, let's take the high tech solution that they provide via high.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Sam_uhlman**: Is it the same, you know, sprinkler solution across the board, you know, 12ft between, between sprinkler lines, every, you know, three to four shelves or whatever it is.
**Speaker 1**: So when you talk about an ASRs system that follows what's called 834.
**Speaker 1**: So it's FM Global Factory Mutual 834 that is the governing body for ASRs solutions.
**Speaker 1**: And typically they're the ones that are insurance stuff anyway.
**Speaker 1**: So with that you have these tables that dictate so for instance for your.
**Speaker 1**: For high particularly so they might, I think the one that they did was like a bigger head but it was 15ft versus you can use like a, sometimes a smaller head and you'll do every 10.
**Speaker 1**: And it really just depends on several factors.
**Speaker 1**: So what a, like what the tote type is, is it cardboard, is it a tray, is it open top adequately vented plastic.
**Speaker 1**: So you, you basically go through these tables and this is, and this is what we do and so like, so like your, your, your Harrisburg job, like high tech reached out to me and said, here's, it's this tall, the building's this tall.
**Speaker 1**: And here's the layout of the racking.
**Speaker 1**: And we said here you go, here's your number, here's your design.
**Speaker 1**: That's, that's all we need.
**Speaker 1**: Got it.
**Sam_uhlman**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: And, and so yeah, so we, we, we do a ton of those ASRs systems.
**Speaker 1**: We've done.
**Speaker 1**: I don't know how many.
**Speaker 1**: I mean we've got three I think going on right now.
**Sam_uhlman**: Okay, got it.
**Sam_uhlman**: So I guess on, on that note, you know, I'm definitely interested in working with you guys on the fire suppression within like the Toad ASRs.
**Sam_uhlman**: You know, it sounds like you guys have plenty of experience in that, you know, you know how to, you know, essentially make it seamless with the Toad ASRs.
**Sam_uhlman**: Right.
**Sam_uhlman**: And keep any sort of cube loss to a minimum.
**Sam_uhlman**: So that I know we want.
**Speaker 1**: What do you mean?
**Sam_uhlman**: Yeah, exactly.
**Sam_uhlman**: There you go.
**Sam_uhlman**: Whereas like, I don't want to trust my like the GC on this site to do that.
**Sam_uhlman**: You know, so I, I know we have some work together here on this next site.
**Sam_uhlman**: I'm trying to figure out where I may be able to speed things up on the, on the HAZMAT side.
**Speaker 1**: So typically what we like and if you've already awarded it, we would come in a lot of times and we do the entire thing.
**Speaker 1**: So your office, build out, build your walls.
**Speaker 1**: I mean we do the whole design and build nuts and bolts because.
**Sam_uhlman**: Including like new offices and things like that.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, we, we again, we, we build these buildings from the ground up and all the build out and everything.
**Speaker 1**: So we're, we're, we're a commercial design builder.
**Speaker 1**: We have our license, I mean in I don't know, like 12 or 14 states, something like that.
**Sam_uhlman**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: So yeah, we're, we're, we're literally, I mean, you know, I came up building hospitals.
**Speaker 1**: Like we're builders.
**Speaker 1**: We just brought in this infrastructure piece because.
**Sam_uhlman**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: I mean we, we were working with so many clients and they were just like, this is a disaster, please help us.
**Speaker 1**: And we're like, okay, well you know, we'll stick around and do it.
**Speaker 1**: Because everybody else just typically you're like, okay, here's your office, here's this piece.
**Sam_uhlman**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: And it's, and then you've got to worry about different permit transitions.
**Speaker 1**: It's a nightmare.
**Speaker 1**: And so we just do it all from the beginning.
**Speaker 1**: It all gets permitted.
**Speaker 1**: It's seamless.
**Speaker 1**: I mean, cool.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, it's I mean, I don't know.
**Speaker 1**: It's, it's what we do.
**Speaker 1**: It's.
**Speaker 1**: I mean, as you can tell, like this.
**Speaker 1**: So like for you, like what I would do what, you know, my opinion.
**Speaker 1**: And again, feel free to use whoever you want.
**Speaker 1**: I don't, you know, doesn't bother me.
**Speaker 1**: I'm happy to help.
**Speaker 1**: I'm a nerd on this stuff.
**Speaker 1**: So Scott Little is the fire chief.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: But they also have a fire code analysis.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: And so that's Donald and Greg.
**Speaker 1**: We'll say Donald's this chief.
**Speaker 1**: So the first thing that I would do is get your report through your, your code compliance company.
**Sam_uhlman**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: And then from there you already have a layout of what it is.
**Speaker 1**: You have that report and everything.
**Speaker 1**: And then, you know, in that report they're going to say this, you know, this is the protection system you have to use for each one of these.
**Speaker 1**: Blah, blah, that's easy.
**Speaker 1**: And then, so get that.
**Speaker 1**: And then what I would do is I will call and get a meeting set with these guys.
**Speaker 1**: Like, I don't know, as soon as they can get this thing done, like in three weeks, go in there, sit down with them, explain the system, you know, go through whatever questions they have, make sure that they, you know, feel comfortable and that they don't have anything on it.
**Speaker 1**: And then that's going to tell you, I mean, you'll know in five minutes what they think.
**Speaker 1**: Like, you know, whether it's oh yeah, it's not a big deal or oh, it is.
**Speaker 1**: Like, I mean, you know, I would also look and see what other warehouses are in the area.
**Speaker 1**: So I know how much exposure they have.
**Speaker 1**: Because some municipalities will walk into, they've never seen one before.
**Speaker 1**: They have no idea.
**Speaker 1**: And so there's a lot of education.
**Speaker 1**: Other ones are like, seen it a thousand times, let's go.
**Sam_uhlman**: Got it.
**Speaker 1**: So that's why like, okay, so Burnville, that we're doing right now, he's never seen one.
**Speaker 1**: We're explaining to him all the components.
**Sam_uhlman**: Got it.
**Sam_uhlman**: Okay.
**Sam_uhlman**: Okay, that's, that's helpful.
**Speaker 1**: Because your, your life safety is going to, you need to make sure that like in the design.
**Speaker 1**: So like when you do the design, right, so in a warehouse you have a 400 foot travel distance that you can do.
**Speaker 1**: And so looking at that and explaining that because again, if I'm, if I'm a reviewer and I see all these robots moving around and they're going through a travel path and I'm like, well, if there's a fire and they're all staggered through here.
**Speaker 1**: How does somebody get out?
**Speaker 1**: Right?
**Speaker 1**: And so we need to think about a couple of those things as if they're going to respond to them and just have, you know, rebuttals and everything already built in.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, here's our.
**Speaker 1**: Here's how it happens.
**Speaker 1**: Here's the contingency.
**Speaker 1**: Like, maybe it's something like, you know, I mean, I'd have to pull up your drawing, but if you have a designated, like, you know, oh, we're gonna have to have a trial path here.
**Speaker 1**: You probably would have like either a rail system, like just the little three inch rails, that's a walk, dedicated walkway with maybe like just one like, crossing section, like if they were crossing railroad tracks and then that.
**Speaker 1**: Then you could be like, hey, here's the exit, blah, blah, blah, something like that.
**Speaker 1**: But again, we, we can think through that.
**Speaker 1**: But that's just off the top of my head.
**Speaker 1**: Some things that.
**Speaker 1**: If you can come in here, like, we can come in here, back here's how we're solving all these issues.
**Speaker 1**: They're gonna push it right through.
**Sam_uhlman**: Yeah.
**Sam_uhlman**: Okay.
**Sam_uhlman**: Okay.
**Sam_uhlman**: I'm trying to figure out who's the.
**Speaker 1**: Landlord on this building.
**Sam_uhlman**: Who's the what?
**Speaker 1**: Landlord on the landlord.
**Sam_uhlman**: Panatoni.
**Sam_uhlman**: You worked with Panettone before?
**Speaker 1**: I don't think so.
**Speaker 1**: Trying to think of if they'd been on any of the buildings we've done.
**Speaker 1**: I can't remember.
**Sam_uhlman**: I can't remember if they.
**Speaker 1**: I can't remember if they did the Allentown one or not.
**Speaker 1**: It was three years ago, but I know it's in the same area.
**Sam_uhlman**: Got it.
**Sam_uhlman**: Okay.
**Sam_uhlman**: I'm trying to figure out if there's anything else I don't know that I can preemptively get ahead of.
**Speaker 1**: Who's your GC that you got?
**Speaker 1**: Are you just having somebody from the landlord.
**Sam_uhlman**: Someone from the landlord would ultimately do that for us.
**Sam_uhlman**: I'm trying to figure out like, kind of what you said, right?
**Sam_uhlman**: Like the.
**Sam_uhlman**: Getting a meeting with the fire code analysis group.
**Sam_uhlman**: If anyone does that in the interest of, Of GPC here or if we're, you know, if that's, if that falls on GPC specifically.
**Speaker 1**: No, I mean, I would do it for.
**Speaker 1**: If, if we were on this program, I'd do it for you.
**Sam_uhlman**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: I mean, you, I mean, no offense, you don't do this for a living, like.
**Sam_uhlman**: Yeah, I don't want to do it.
**Sam_uhlman**: I.
**Sam_uhlman**: I may not be compelling enough.
**Speaker 1**: No, you, you.
**Speaker 1**: I, I would again if.
**Speaker 1**: If you don't.
**Speaker 1**: If we don't do this, like you need to have somebody that speaks the language.
**Speaker 1**: Now it's, you know, we're fortunate and what makes us successful is because we speak both languages.
**Sam_uhlman**: Wait, so if, if we get like Harrington group to just do the code compliance piece and from that perspective I'm like, I believe it would just be, you know, here's your maximum allowable quantity of just a report of that.
**Sam_uhlman**: Right.
**Sam_uhlman**: But there's no, no sort of construction details required.
**Sam_uhlman**: Like it would just be the amount of goods in the system or does that tie into.
**Speaker 1**: Well, their report will say, it'll give you all the quantities and then it'll, it'll say like aerosol max.
**Speaker 1**: They'll cite the code and it'll say max height of 30ft.
**Speaker 1**: I'm trying to remember we just did one of these for civil logistics.
**Speaker 1**: And so I'm trying to remember all the, all the stuff.
**Speaker 1**: But like that's exactly what they did.
**Speaker 1**: They say, hey Brandon, here's the report.
**Sam_uhlman**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: You know, give us, give us a design and a cost for everything we have to do.
**Speaker 1**: And so that's going to say, hey, you've got a max storage height in the aerosol of 30ft.
**Speaker 1**: And you know, you've got, you know, two R rated wall around your HAZMAT area.
**Speaker 1**: You know, it's going to site again nfpa, blah, blah, blah.
**Speaker 1**: Like it'll give you two options.
**Speaker 1**: Like typically like the aerosol ones, like you can do 30ft, you know, in fence or I think you could do like staggered.
**Speaker 1**: I can't remember.
**Speaker 1**: There's a couple different options, but that'll be in their standard report.
**Speaker 1**: Like they'll, they'll have got it.
**Sam_uhlman**: Okay, I, I think talking through this.
**Sam_uhlman**: First of all, this has been very helpful.
**Sam_uhlman**: Talking through this.
**Speaker 1**: I'll even see the recording.
**Sam_uhlman**: Yeah, I'd love to see it.
**Sam_uhlman**: Talking through this.
**Sam_uhlman**: It doesn't sound like there's any.
**Sam_uhlman**: It sounds like we kind of have to keep going with the Harrington group to get through just the code part.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, you just need again, a, a code.
**Speaker 1**: It's just a code study.
**Sam_uhlman**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Which is, is what they do now as far as walking through and getting it approved.
**Speaker 1**: Like I would not encourage you to use them at all.
**Sam_uhlman**: No, we, we don't anticipate that.
**Sam_uhlman**: It, it sounds like we would look to get you guys involved as soon as we have that HAZMAT report.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: I mean, and even usually a lot of times we're, you know, because they're going to have calls asking questions and usually we're in on those calls to Again, bridge the language barrier.
**Sam_uhlman**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Because they're going to say all this engineering stuff and then I'm going to turn around and say what he means is how fast do the robots go.
**Sam_uhlman**: Got it.
**Speaker 1**: So in your guys lease you have TI dollars.
**Sam_uhlman**: Yep.
**Speaker 1**: So do you, you get a control who you award it to or do you have to use OGC and pay that fee?
**Sam_uhlman**: We don't, we don't have to lump everything in with the.
**Sam_uhlman**: Well, I don't think about it.
**Sam_uhlman**: Let me get back to you on that one.
**Sam_uhlman**: I don't know what we're tied to using within the GC and what we're not.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, because that would be, that's how we got started in this is that, I mean the landlord.
**Speaker 1**: GC works as a landlord, you know.
**Sam_uhlman**: Right.
**Speaker 1**: Period.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Speaker 1**: And so instead, hey, I'll, I'll take the TI dollars and hire my own guy.
**Speaker 1**: You know, it doesn't cost 400 to screen light bulb.
**Sam_uhlman**: Yeah, yeah.
**Sam_uhlman**: Okay, let me, I'm gonna dig into that one because obviously if, if you're more in our interest and not of the landlord interest, then that could be of benefit to us.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, absolutely.
**Speaker 1**: And again, just the seamless transition.
**Speaker 1**: So, but yeah, so again if, if Harrington Group can turn the report around, you know, within a few weeks or a month, you know, that's, that's pretty good.
**Speaker 1**: I don't know what their timing is.
**Speaker 1**: If, if not like I said, we've got, you know, I've got different coded code people that we work with around the country.
**Speaker 1**: So you know, if, if they're telling you it's going to be a long time, then we can look at, you know, teaming up and doing it quicker.
**Speaker 1**: Again, I'm not gonna do the study, I'm just gonna drive the timeline.
**Sam_uhlman**: Got it, got it.
**Sam_uhlman**: Any say, anyone that comes with a high recommendation in the Pennsylvania area.
**Speaker 1**: I'd have to go look at, I need to go look at the report that I did for that SIBA one.
**Speaker 1**: It was pretty, it was pretty good.
**Speaker 1**: They did a good job.
**Speaker 1**: But yeah, I can, I, I can look at a couple of them trying to think who, who did Easton, Pennsylvania?
**Speaker 1**: I don't know.
**Speaker 1**: Too many different vendors.
**Sam_uhlman**: Let me know, Think about it and see if, if, if there is one you would highly recommend.
**Sam_uhlman**: I may be wanting to, to reach out and just get a timeline perspective here, but trying to move quickly in an area that doesn't seem to want to move quickly.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, it's annoying, trust me.
**Sam_uhlman**: Yeah.
**Sam_uhlman**: Okay, well thank you.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, for sure.
**Speaker 1**: And then so do you Guys, where I didn't see where is your ASR is going to go in this building?
**Sam_uhlman**: Yeah, we didn't really get over to that area of it.
**Speaker 1**: I got another five minutes if, if you do.
**Sam_uhlman**: Yeah, I think I do as well.
**Sam_uhlman**: Let's see.
**Sam_uhlman**: It's kind of my top priority at the moment.
**Sam_uhlman**: It's, it's like over in this side here.
**Speaker 1**: There it is.
**Sam_uhlman**: So there's the ASRs, here's our high bay racking.
**Speaker 1**: Is that a shuttle sorter?
**Speaker 1**: No, it's not.
**Speaker 1**: It's the high pit.
**Sam_uhlman**: Yeah.
**Sam_uhlman**: It's just your tote based y solution.
**Speaker 1**: Yep.
**Sam_uhlman**: So that's what we got.
**Sam_uhlman**: I, I, I just need to figure out from a, if, if Harrington's kind of pushing towards us to just go with a manual solution here is really what it comes down to.
**Sam_uhlman**: You know, it's, and that's my fear is that I, they are obviously feeling a lot more confident with it if we isolate it from the rest of the building.
**Speaker 1**: I, I mean again, like I would be interested to have that conversation like in, you know, I may not be an engineer, but I read the codes a lot and I don't know where there's anything that says that a robot cannot move hazardous material.
**Speaker 1**: This, this type.
**Sam_uhlman**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Like I, I, I don't, I don't think it exists.
**Speaker 1**: And that's where I just think it comes down to a conversation.
**Sam_uhlman**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So yeah, I would be, I would be very interested just to hear what they say because I, I think again, I think this is very doable.
**Speaker 1**: You know, again, maybe there's something that is in there that says, hey, you know, you can't do this because XYZ then.
**Sam_uhlman**: Okay, well that's where I'm trying to bridge a gap here because as the, as the folks that are reading through the code, I don't know why all of a sudden we're talking about robots and spills in this area when that seems to be to me more like, hey, let's talk about storage and more general operating procedures.
**Sam_uhlman**: Like this is no different than a manual solution when it comes to transporting it.
**Sam_uhlman**: Besides the point that like an employee can see something that we just need to make sure that we accommodate via automation in some capacity.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, yeah.
**Speaker 1**: As far as the, as far as the storage component, again, it doesn't switch from anything else.
**Sam_uhlman**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: You know, any other static rack, it's just a matter of, of those robots moving.
**Speaker 1**: But again, I think that the risk that you have right of it, you know, it'll shut down in case of alarm and you know, again, and they may not even bring it us, but I would be preemptive about it tipping.
**Speaker 1**: You know, how do you prevent, prevent an easy, you know, fall, you know, that would be something I, I would, I would look at.
**Sam_uhlman**: Okay, okay, let me, let me follow up on a couple of these.
**Sam_uhlman**: And then like I said, I anticipate working with you guys on this site.
**Sam_uhlman**: To what extent I think we'll need to, we'll need to iron out.
**Sam_uhlman**: But I know we'll be working, working with you guys on this site, certainly.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So you, if you guys close, I mean, if you guys.
**Speaker 1**: End of June, you close, it's going to take you.
**Speaker 1**: If you don't start drawings till then, assuming that you have somebody push it, you'll get drawings inside of three months.
**Speaker 1**: Puts you at September.
**Speaker 1**: Assuming that, you know, you go with us, you'd already have material on the way, so you would start right away.
**Speaker 1**: I mean, you could easily get done well before November.
**Sam_uhlman**: Yeah, yeah, we got, we have nothing but time.
**Sam_uhlman**: Well, in November, keep in mind, like the Go live is November of next year.
**Speaker 1**: That's what I'm saying.
**Speaker 1**: Like you can easily get them.
**Speaker 1**: And I mean, I, I would think that you would want to go live in August, do a, like a practice before peak.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Sam_uhlman**: Yep.
**Speaker 1**: You know, nobody wants to go live on Black Friday.
**Sam_uhlman**: Agreed.
**Sam_uhlman**: Agreed.
**Sam_uhlman**: Yeah, November never works out.
**Sam_uhlman**: I come from Amazon and Walmart.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Sam_uhlman**: And so, yeah, we've tried a number.
**Speaker 1**: Of times, but I, so we, we do a lot with like radio and like Cart and you know, guys like that and radial.
**Speaker 1**: I mean every time they'll, they'll sign a lease and be like, hey, we gotta, we gotta be ready for, for peak.
**Speaker 1**: You know, it's like, dude, that's in four months.
**Speaker 1**: Like we gotta be operational.
**Speaker 1**: We're gonna have 2, 000 people in here picking.
**Speaker 1**: You couldn't, you couldn't just wait?
**Speaker 1**: Couldn't just wait.
**Sam_uhlman**: Takes a lot to steer a battleship, you know.
**Speaker 1**: Really does.
**Speaker 1**: Really does.
**Speaker 1**: So cool, man.
**Speaker 1**: Well, yeah, enjoyed it.
**Speaker 1**: Like I said, I'm a, I'm a nerd of this kind of stuff.
**Speaker 1**: So.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I love to, you know, be a part of this one and walk it all the way through.
**Speaker 1**: That way you can have a good experience versus pulling the rest of that hair out.
**Sam_uhlman**: Absolutely.
**Sam_uhlman**: Absolutely.
**Sam_uhlman**: Okay, well, and I may, you know, as we look to stand up, however, what we call our activation engineering team, that's what we're doing here.
**Sam_uhlman**: We're basically my team of four people.
**Sam_uhlman**: You know, I've got two Peers and a senior director above me that is overseeing, taking the design from the concept stage.
**Sam_uhlman**: We're going through firm engineering, through boots on the ground, physical installation of this stuff, and we're figuring this out as we go.
**Sam_uhlman**: So a lot of this is.
**Sam_uhlman**: Is new to the company, you know, new to us in places that we have not experienced in the past.
**Sam_uhlman**: And so I, I may, you know, we, we may be talking in the near future about what that scope could look like to make sure that there are no gaps.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So are you guys.
**Speaker 1**: Is your company just growing or did you used to outsource it?
**Speaker 1**: Now you're bringing it in.
**Speaker 1**: How did you do fulfillment before?
**Sam_uhlman**: Yeah, we are, we are growing and we are building up a new supply chain.
**Sam_uhlman**: So there's plenty of work on the horizon.
**Sam_uhlman**: This is a.
**Sam_uhlman**: We're building something new.
**Sam_uhlman**: Processes that did not previously exist.
**Speaker 1**: What's.
**Speaker 1**: And so I, I looked up obviously a little bit about gpc.
**Speaker 1**: I just kind of saw his automotive supplies.
**Speaker 1**: Is it, Is it just that you're.
**Speaker 1**: What's the new system or process?
**Sam_uhlman**: I mean, it's.
**Sam_uhlman**: It's basically, you know, a supply chain that's been around several decades and we've got a couple of folks coming in with, you know, experience at Walmart, Amazon, Target.
**Sam_uhlman**: We're just enhancing our supply chain network.
**Sam_uhlman**: So that's really.
**Speaker 1**: Basically.
**Speaker 1**: It sounds like when I, When I came from doing hospitals and you know, like in construction, you know, it's like a pyramid in hospitals.
**Speaker 1**: Creme de la creme.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Speaker 1**: You can't go from building a house to bed tower, surgical center, nothing like that.
**Sam_uhlman**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Very easy to go down.
**Speaker 1**: And so I, I remember when I did my first warehouse, you know, I was like, you know, I all of a sudden came in, I was like, you know, bring all those different kinds of things to that industry.
**Speaker 1**: And it's.
**Speaker 1**: I mean, that's why we're so good at this.
**Sam_uhlman**: Yeah.
**Sam_uhlman**: Yeah.
**Sam_uhlman**: It's like your standards have been up here.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I mean, we have a, we have a saying at our company.
**Sam_uhlman**: It's called be urgent early like that.
**Sam_uhlman**: I'm a fan of that.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, that's.
**Speaker 1**: I always.
**Speaker 1**: Every single time, like push every chance you can get.
**Speaker 1**: You know, you're not here to make friends.
**Speaker 1**: We're here to make money.
**Speaker 1**: And time is money.
**Sam_uhlman**: Yeah, I, I like the, the urgency.
**Sam_uhlman**: That's a.
**Sam_uhlman**: It's a lot easier to claw.
**Sam_uhlman**: Claw back timeline later, you know.
**Speaker 1**: Exactly.
**Sam_uhlman**: I mean, because call that timeline now.
**Speaker 1**: Than it is if you, if you say, oh, it'll.
**Speaker 1**: And you let this, this, this.
**Speaker 1**: You know, and you see all this stuff, that's not what screws you.
**Speaker 1**: It's the thing you don't see coming that sideswipes you and then the whole train is at the trimock.
**Speaker 1**: Whereas if you're just, if you're, if you're pedal the metal from the get go and that thing comes, you can adjust, you can move, you can be nimble, you can.
**Speaker 1**: It doesn't kill you.
**Sam_uhlman**: Yep.
**Sam_uhlman**: Right on.
**Sam_uhlman**: All right, thank you for your time.
**Sam_uhlman**: Let me.
**Sam_uhlman**: I'm gonna follow up on a couple of these items and then we'll be in touch.
**Sam_uhlman**: Like I said, I, I know we have at least some scope to work work with you guys on sooner than later.
**Sam_uhlman**: I, I may see if, see if, if you can help me out with kind of a all inclusive scope.
**Sam_uhlman**: What that would look like almost like a la carte style if you will.
**Sam_uhlman**: And then we can, we can figure out what that, what that holistic scope looks like to be successful here.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I think so.
**Speaker 1**: When Radial did this, they had their big gear up in like 2019.
**Speaker 1**: I don't know.
**Speaker 1**: Do you know Radial is Bevos company, they're a fulfillment company.
**Sam_uhlman**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: You know, they're, they're, it's owned by the Belgian post office.
**Speaker 1**: They're here.
**Speaker 1**: They, you know, pretty good s.
**Speaker 1**: Anyway, they did this big ramp up 2019, 2021.
**Speaker 1**: And we did the same thing where we did a program like programming so that every single site we had, all right, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
**Speaker 1**: So you hit the ground running.
**Speaker 1**: It was all already set up.
**Speaker 1**: The designs were good.
**Speaker 1**: Like we just would wash and repeat like and just got it to where it was a well oiled machine.
**Sam_uhlman**: Awesome.
**Sam_uhlman**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Which I mean again, these systems are all the same.
**Speaker 1**: It's just your little tweaks here and there and I mean it's just like Amazon, right?
**Speaker 1**: Or Walmart.
**Speaker 1**: It's the same thing.
**Speaker 1**: That's what we do on the construction side.
**Sam_uhlman**: Yeah, that's, that's great.
**Sam_uhlman**: You know, you don't have a, like a sample proposal that you could share with me, do you?
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Like, like for a job like this?
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Hold on a second.
**Sam_uhlman**: It doesn't have to be right now, but I'd love to, to see it if you can.
**Sam_uhlman**: If you have one.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, you know, show me that.
**Speaker 1**: Like a.
**Speaker 1**: Talk about like one for a different company in the past.
**Speaker 1**: Right?
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Speaker 1**: It's.
**Speaker 1**: I'll.
**Speaker 1**: I can send one to you.
**Speaker 1**: It's pretty.
**Speaker 1**: Again, very simple.
**Speaker 1**: It's follows the divisional format and I'll put a little video together for you and explain it to you how it works.
**Sam_uhlman**: Awesome.
**Speaker 1**: So.
**Sam_uhlman**: Okay.
**Sam_uhlman**: Yeah.
**Sam_uhlman**: Okay.
**Sam_uhlman**: Well, thank you.
**Sam_uhlman**: I got to hop here, but Brandon and we'll be talking soon.
**Speaker 1**: Sure.
**Speaker 1**: See you, Sam.
**Sam_uhlman**: All right.
**Sam_uhlman**: See you.
**Sam_uhlman**: Bye.
**Speaker 1**: Bye.
