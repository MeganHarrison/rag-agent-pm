## Transcript
**Ataylor**: It sa.
**Blake.schneider**: Hey, Blake, can you hear me?
**Blake.schneider**: Yes, I can.
**Ataylor**: Okay, so do you have everything that you need from us?
**Ataylor**: I know AJ Sent to the CAD drawings.
**Blake.schneider**: Yep.
**Blake.schneider**: We.
**Blake.schneider**: Our designers working on the drawing right now.
**Blake.schneider**: Once that's done, we'll send that over to you guys for approval.
**Blake.schneider**: If that gets, you know, once that gets approved, then we'll get state submittal and all that situation.
**Blake.schneider**: I mean, I don't think it's going to be anything crazy.
**Blake.schneider**: So, you know, as soon as you guys give us approval, we'll.
**Blake.schneider**: We'll order all the material right then and there.
**Blake.schneider**: That way we already have the material ready to go, and then we'll get the permits and everything that we need for the project.
**Ataylor**: Sweet, because we're gearing up to start that one next week.
**Ataylor**: Still working through a few things.
**Ataylor**: I gotta get my structural steel guy lagging behind a little bit.
**Ataylor**: I gotta reinforce all the openings before I cut them.
**Ataylor**: So getting into the building is a little tricky without those being cut open.
**Ataylor**: There is one door, but I don't know how easy it will be to get a lift through it to get into our space to start working.
**Blake.schneider**: Yeah.
**Blake.schneider**: Is there.
**Ataylor**: Hp?
**Blake.schneider**: Is there access through, like a back entrance or something that we could bring a lift into?
**Ataylor**: No, there's only one side door.
**Ataylor**: And, I mean, it's just a small 307 outdoor.
**Blake.schneider**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: I really need to get the front.
**Ataylor**: I need to get the front entry cut open.
**Blake.schneider**: Yeah.
**Blake.schneider**: Start next week.
**Blake.schneider**: Is that just.
**Blake.schneider**: You're saying in general for the whole project, or you want us on site next week?
**Ataylor**: Just in general for the whole project.
**Blake.schneider**: Okay, perfect.
**Ataylor**: And then as far as logic goes, like, I want to get.
**Ataylor**: I have it set up on this video right now.
**Blake.schneider**: Look.
**Ataylor**: I have you guys in there running overhead stuff before everybody while I'm pulling this up.
**Ataylor**: Do you have somebody at that sushi place for that?
**Blake.schneider**: Yep, my guys are on site right now.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: They have everything that they need to get into the room.
**Ataylor**: All right.
**Blake.schneider**: They're already working on it.
**Ataylor**: Beautiful.
**Ataylor**: Can you please just let me know when they're finished up so I can.
**Blake.schneider**: Absolutely.
**Ataylor**: Have a radio?
**Ataylor**: Avon, you guys dig underneath the mezzan.
**Ataylor**: Openings will be on the 1/5.
**Ataylor**: Basically, you should be able to get into there.
**Blake.schneider**: What was that date again?
**Ataylor**: I have.
**Ataylor**: I have.
**Ataylor**: Starting on July 8th.
**Blake.schneider**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: I got 10 days, 10 working days in there for you.
**Ataylor**: Is that enough?
**Blake.schneider**: I think that'll be all right.
**Ataylor**: Actually, I got H vac going before you.
**Ataylor**: This pod.
**Ataylor**: If you're 9 foot 6 ceilings.
**Ataylor**: What's your elevation?
**Blake.schneider**: For your.
**Ataylor**: Your pipe, you're just gonna do drops.
**Blake.schneider**: We can be.
**Blake.schneider**: We can be flexible with it.
**Blake.schneider**: We're going to use six foot flexes.
**Blake.schneider**: So we, you know, we'll try to get that, you know, the small, the smaller pipe that will kind of hang above the drop ceiling.
**Blake.schneider**: We'll probably try to keep that like two feet above the drop ceiling, but we could go as low as a foot above.
**Blake.schneider**: We need to.
**Ataylor**: Big deal.
**Ataylor**: I've kind of reached out to all the other subs individually, so I don't know how many people are going to jump into this, but I'm glad you did.
**Ataylor**: We can discuss it.
**Ataylor**: But if there's anything else you need for me.
**Ataylor**: You have another.
**Blake.schneider**: Yeah, no, that's.
**Blake.schneider**: I'm.
**Blake.schneider**: We're pretty squared away on it.
**Blake.schneider**: Once.
**Blake.schneider**: Once I get that drawing, we'll have all the elevations on there.
**Blake.schneider**: So, you know, we can talk through it then if we need to make adjustments to help out other trades.
**Blake.schneider**: But I think, yeah, there's gonna be a lot of space to put stuff above.
**Ataylor**: Oh, yeah.
**Ataylor**: Well, that ceiling is huge.
**Ataylor**: So, I mean, it's just making sure that you and H Vac pick an elevation and run with it so there's not heads on it.
**Blake.schneider**: Yeah, we should be good to go.
**Ataylor**: All right, well, let me know when they're done up in Fishers.
**Ataylor**: I'll talk to you later.
**Blake.schneider**: All right, sounds good.
**Ataylor**: All right.
