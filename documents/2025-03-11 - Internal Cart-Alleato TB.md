## Transcript
**Ataylor**: Hey, guys.
**Jdawson**: Driving in a truck, so if it gets too loud, just let me know.
**Ataylor**: All good.
**Ataylor**: Can hear you good now.
**Bclymer**: Hello.
**Ataylor**: Hey, A.J.
**Bclymer**: How you doing, sir?
**Ataylor**: Pretty well.
**Bclymer**: No, Brandon spoke with you this morning and I sent you the proposal with the scope as well of all of our design drawings.
**Bclymer**: And I know you probably haven't had a chance to digest everything yet, so I was just gonna briefly go through it if that's okay with you or.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, let's do it.
**Bclymer**: Hold up here.
**Speaker 3**: Share my screen.
**Bclymer**: Alrighty.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Speaker 4**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So our concrete went down a tad.
**Bclymer**: Metals went up.
**Bclymer**: A little bit of roofing in there for each RTU opening stayed the same.
**Bclymer**: Finishes for the drop ceiling stayed the same.
**Bclymer**: Our fire suppression actually went down.
**Bclymer**: I was able to get two more prices for that.
**Bclymer**: And then plumbing, we kept some money in there for the condensate, tying that to a sanitary and then our H vac.
**Jdawson**: And that's for the rooftop units?
**Bclymer**: Yep, for the rooftop units.
**Bclymer**: And then that is our locked in H vac for.
**Bclymer**: For 20 units.
**Bclymer**: And then electrical, we took out 40.
**Bclymer**: Took out 40 freezers.
**Bclymer**: We're going to still run all of our raceways for them.
**Bclymer**: And then we're only doing three generators.
**Bclymer**: And then for the fourth transformer, that's what our H VAC will be on.
**Bclymer**: And then exterior improvements stayed the same, so.
**Bclymer**: Nope, we don't have any contingency in here anymore, Steve, as the H vac ate up all that in the steel reinforcement.
**Bclymer**: So that's a very quick rundown.
**Bclymer**: We're pretty detailed in our clarifications.
**Bclymer**: If you read through it as to what's included with each division.
**Bclymer**: You've seen these before.
**Speaker 4**: So.
**Speaker 4**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: What, what, what questions do you have?
**Ataylor**: Not really a ton.
**Ataylor**: I mean, kind of, you know, we've been talking about a lot, so.
**Ataylor**: Definitely in line with what I was expecting.
**Ataylor**: I guess maybe the one question I have is like, we definitely feel like this has everything that we reasonably think Shane wants or needs to submit to him, you know, to get feedback before you start.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah, I mean, I.
**Bclymer**: I've gone through these pretty thoroughly.
**Bclymer**: We caught a couple snags and I've asked the electrician to change those.
**Bclymer**: Steve, we already got the updated mechanicals back.
**Bclymer**: That's why I didn't send them out Friday.
**Bclymer**: And I think.
**Bclymer**: I think before you send them to Shane, I would really like Jesse to comb through it one time a little bit more and then.
**Bclymer**: And then Brandon, if he wants to, but I.
**Bclymer**: I'm comfortable with sending what we have to Shane right now.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, I mean, I'm gonna get just feedback from like, Joe and stuff before, you know, I just want to make sure that we have internal alignment on everything before I open that can of worm and, and send it to Shane, so.
**Bclymer**: For sure.
**Ataylor**: And yeah.
**Jdawson**: Thanks, Steve.
**Jdawson**: That still having work on as an actual design for that.
**Jdawson**: The H VAC drains, that would be the only thing that we don't have a drawing for that we're installing.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: But we.
**Bclymer**: What we have, what we what, what we had him throw in there, Steve, is a note.
**Bclymer**: There's a particular note in here that, that.
**Speaker 4**: Oh, where is it?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, right here.
**Bclymer**: Node 8.
**Bclymer**: New condensate piping for new RTU.
**Bclymer**: The new condensate state piping to be CPVC, yada, yada, yada.
**Bclymer**: And basically it says route to the nearest approved drain.
**Bclymer**: So, And Steve, Craig, you may be able to answer this for me.
**Bclymer**: Those 15 existing units in that space, are they currently tied into a condensate drain?
**Ataylor**: Is what tied into a condensate drain?
**Bclymer**: Those existing.
**Jdawson**: Is it on the roof or is it going to a sanitary store for.
**Ataylor**: The existing AC units?
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, they are.
**Speaker 3**: They have condensate drains.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Speaker 4**: Okay, so.
**Bclymer**: So, Steve, most likely we'll just tie into what those are already tied into.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, they're going like to the bathroom drains and.
**Speaker 4**: Yep.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, I think for what we're adding it.
**Ataylor**: That seems very doable.
**Speaker 4**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And, and I assumed that because I know Mechanical systems was in there doing all that work last year.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: Not in that warehouse, though.
**Ataylor**: They were working in like.
**Speaker 4**: Okay.
**Speaker 3**: Which is building eight.
**Speaker 4**: Yep.
**Speaker 4**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So that may take just a little more.
**Bclymer**: More digging, but I, I, I would hope that this, this note.
**Bclymer**: And honestly, I don't know at this point with Shane what.
**Bclymer**: But I would hope that that would be sufficient for him, but it may not be.
**Speaker 3**: Y'all, y'all prepare yourself for him to come back with a big list.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, well, we're trying our best to not have that.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, we.
**Speaker 3**: I don't think he's that kind of guy.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: We had a meeting, Shane, with our internal legal team.
**Ataylor**: And, and they talked to the real op legal team, and they basically said as long as you get permits and the work is permitted and you give us notice and tell us what you're doing.
**Ataylor**: If the local jurisdiction signs off on our permit, that we did all the work the way that it's supposed to, Shane can't do anything.
**Bclymer**: Well, that's helpful.
**Ataylor**: So, you know, I think that's what we're really going to push.
**Ataylor**: And like, you Know he's gonna probably and complain.
**Ataylor**: But we're just gonna say talk to your lawyers.
**Ataylor**: We don't give a.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Because otherwise, you know, he could just ask for a million and one things that are above and beyond.
**Ataylor**: And you know, we're just, you know, we're not made of money.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: And at the end of the day, you know, we're want to provide a safe space and we are getting it all permitted, so you shouldn't have an issue with that.
**Bclymer**: And we're making the building much better for them.
**Speaker 4**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: So the only kind of gray area where we are going to have to work with real op is is that new roof that's going over sea.
**Bclymer**: Have they started that yet?
**Speaker 3**: They're halfway finished.
**Speaker 4**: Okay.
**Speaker 3**: That's going to be a mess, taking out all that and putting new in it.
**Speaker 3**: Just, you know, they probably should have waited put the roof in when they were finished, honestly.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I mean, timeline, obviously they couldn't do that.
**Bclymer**: But I'm okay.
**Bclymer**: I mean, I.
**Bclymer**: I feel better.
**Bclymer**: I don't know, Jesse, if you agree with.
**Bclymer**: With flashing in new curbs on a new roof versus that old thing.
**Bclymer**: Because then they could blame us for a lot.
**Speaker 4**: Yeah.
**Speaker 4**: It'll be.
**Jdawson**: It'll be nicer to tie into a new roof because then every league around it becomes your fault.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: I.
**Speaker 3**: I hope that they finish this roof before y'all start with a good enough period of time that we can say, hey, it's leaking here.
**Speaker 3**: You need and got all the leaks fixed.
**Speaker 4**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: So we know we got a good roof to start with.
**Bclymer**: Well, time timeline wise, I mean.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, we won't be.
**Bclymer**: We're a few months out to setting all of these curbs, so.
**Speaker 3**: Well, they're taking their sweet time to put these roofs on.
**Speaker 4**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Well, there again, if they're going to replace it and we could get it done before they got done, then, you know, that would be good too.
**Jdawson**: They could just roof up to our new curbs, so.
**Jdawson**: But I don't know what's on there now that might affect, you know, what we flash up the sides of the curbs so that it would just match the new roof.
**Jdawson**: I don't know.
**Jdawson**: We'd have to look and see.
**Speaker 3**: I think AJ says TPO on and it.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, it's a standard.
**Bclymer**: That's what I based our pricing off of.
**Bclymer**: Was TPO 45 mil?
**Speaker 4**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I don't know.
**Bclymer**: I don't know the exact mill, Steve.
**Bclymer**: It'll either be 35 or 45.
**Speaker 3**: Well, usually it's 60s.
**Speaker 3**: The.
**Speaker 3**: The good stuff, but they put in 45 on there.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I remember Shane mentioning something around 45, but off the top of my head I'm not sure.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, they went with the thin stuff.
**Speaker 4**: So.
**Bclymer**: Steve, obviously I, I'm not 100% sure your timeline.
**Bclymer**: I know when we spoke last week that I think the government was showing up this week.
**Bclymer**: Is that correct?
**Ataylor**: Not at Memphis, but no, they are tomorrow.
**Ataylor**: Oh, nice.
**Ataylor**: Oh, is that for that.
**Ataylor**: Are they doing that transfer this week?
**Speaker 4**: Yes, they're picking up the Marburg.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: But yeah, they're.
**Ataylor**: The visit that I was telling you about, AJ is at two of our other facilities and it's with like our, our head point of contact that as far as we understand, is the one that kind of makes decisions about like us, you know, moving forward and different things like that.
**Ataylor**: So we, we're hoping that, you know, at the conclusion of this week we'll have better time frame and such kind of narrow down.
**Bclymer**: Well, okay, so I've released them on, on the long lead items as you know, so it's just let me know so I can start getting this ordered.
**Bclymer**: Because I mean, our, our.
**Bclymer**: I just spoke with Train and we're, we're exploring other options, but I mean we're going to be 20 weeks on these units, so that, that's being conservative.
**Bclymer**: But I, I would, I would estimate, you know, 16 weeks to meet in the middle.
**Speaker 4**: So.
**Bclymer**: That puts us in, you know, middle of summer, setting them all.
**Bclymer**: And we'll set him with a, with a helicopter.
**Speaker 4**: Yep.
**Speaker 3**: You should be able to reach building C with a crane.
**Bclymer**: I had one of my H VAC guys out there and he, he thought that some of it was going to be iffy getting to that far south end of C.
**Bclymer**: Steve.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: These are, these are pretty big units to be a really big crane.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay, well, as far as.
**Bclymer**: Go ahead, Steve.
**Ataylor**: I mean, I'm pretty good.
**Ataylor**: What, what, you know, we need, I think, you know, balls in our court will get you guys some feedback as quickly as possible.
**Speaker 4**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Just.
**Bclymer**: Quick side update, Eric.
**Bclymer**: We got our locates done.
**Bclymer**: I know you sent me that, that photo of the gate hitting our gate.
**Bclymer**: I know we talked about that potentially happening.
**Bclymer**: So what I'm having them do is figure out a solution to put a stop on that gate that swings.
**Bclymer**: He's supposed to get back to me today.
**Speaker 3**: Hey, J.
**Bclymer**: And, and so we can have that arm miss because it's a very wide drive in.
**Bclymer**: So we're coming up with a couple solutions for that and we wanted to reuse that existing conduit and raceway for the.
**Bclymer**: For the power.
**Bclymer**: That's why we use that pad.
**Speaker 4**: If they just move that arm like two inches.
**Speaker 4**: Yeah, I know it would work.
**Speaker 4**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So there's.
**Speaker 3**: There's room on that pad.
**Speaker 3**: There's room on that pad to move.
**Speaker 4**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: I mean, you could move it 4 to 6 inches over and.
**Speaker 3**: And it will miss the gate.
**Speaker 4**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So, yeah, the only issue is they put their loops in and I kind of got on them for.
**Bclymer**: I thought they were doing that on Monday and they.
**Bclymer**: I guess they just.
**Bclymer**: They had a really quick day over the weekend and were able to get it done.
**Bclymer**: So I'll.
**Bclymer**: We're working through that.
**Bclymer**: Solution locates have been called.
**Bclymer**: I'll zero in on a bore date for you.
**Bclymer**: So we'll board for that guard shack and we'll be up and running here.
**Speaker 3**: Mitch was here yesterday.
**Speaker 3**: The electrician.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, he was walking.
**Speaker 3**: I think he said they're getting ready to board pretty quick.
**Speaker 3**: I think.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, within the week.
**Bclymer**: He just doesn't know an exact day for me, so.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: They just want.
**Bclymer**: They want to be able to run all that power and knock it out at once.
**Speaker 4**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Anything else for me?
**Ataylor**: I'm good.
**Ataylor**: Appreciate it.
**Bclymer**: All righty, guys.
**Bclymer**: Have a good one.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Ataylor**: Appreciate you guys.
**Ataylor**: Thanks.
