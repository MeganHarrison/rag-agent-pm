**Kbreig**: Sa.
**Speaker 1**: Hey, Kelly, how's it going?
**Kbreig**: Good, good.
**Kbreig**: I'm in the car right now, so sorry if here's some road noise.
**Speaker 1**: All good.
**Kbreig**: Okay, so real quick.
**Kbreig**: I met with Charles and Matt yesterday, so real for.
**Kbreig**: And Rogers, of course.
**Kbreig**: And our plan is.
**Kbreig**: Is the week of the 16th is what we're gearing up for.
**Kbreig**: So we have to lock in our.
**Kbreig**: Our crane and that'll set the tone, but it's really only going to take.
**Kbreig**: So the roofing is going to take a day, and they'll do it at the same time we install these curbs.
**Kbreig**: And then there's probably two or three days after that and we'll be done.
**Kbreig**: So if we can start on Monday or Tuesday, we'll be done that week.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: So roofing will take one day.
**Speaker 1**: Everything can be completed.
**Kbreig**: You want me to give you like a day one and then.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, yeah.
**Kbreig**: So day one is lift rtu, install curb adapter.
**Kbreig**: And that same.
**Kbreig**: That same day, we will cut the roof for our new curbs and we'll do our roof flashing on those curbs.
**Kbreig**: That's day one.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, pause.
**Speaker 1**: Is there any impact to operations inside the building during this?
**Speaker 1**: No, no impact to operations.
**Kbreig**: Okay, day two.
**Kbreig**: I'm sorry.
**Speaker 1**: You're good.
**Speaker 1**: Hold on.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, day two.
**Kbreig**: Day two will start running our ductwork on the roof.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Kbreig**: No impact to operations.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Kbreig**: And then that'll.
**Kbreig**: I would say make that day day three as well, just to add a buffer.
**Kbreig**: No impact to operations.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Kbreig**: And then day.
**Kbreig**: Day four, we will then be inside installing those four way diffusers.
**Speaker 1**: Installing the diffusers.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, got it.
**Speaker 1**: That being said, a couple of.
**Speaker 1**: Well, that's kind of nice because it's just the ductwork and diffusers.
**Speaker 1**: We won't need to change any power or like BMS hookups, will we?
**Kbreig**: No.
**Kbreig**: So Rogers will handle the bms.
**Kbreig**: I did want to talk to you about electrical.
**Kbreig**: So I have.
**Kbreig**: Okay, we will.
**Kbreig**: We will have to put a junction box there and basically extend that line potentially to reconnect it.
**Kbreig**: Because imagine we're basically raising these units up in place so they might sit higher.
**Kbreig**: So we can do that adapter.
**Kbreig**: And so would.
**Kbreig**: Do you want to use your electricity for that or do you.
**Kbreig**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: And he can be on site because I already had a P.O.
**Speaker 1**: out to him for when he had a disconnect.
**Speaker 1**: What did he have to do with that?
**Speaker 1**: He had to assist with like the disconnection for the original diffuser.
**Speaker 1**: So.
**Kbreig**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: I already have a PO out for him, so it's just easier.
**Speaker 1**: But I can have him Connect with you on day four for that.
**Speaker 1**: If that's when that work needs to happen.
**Speaker 1**: Or if you want me to have him connect on day three, that's fine too.
**Kbreig**: Yeah.
**Kbreig**: If you just want to.
**Kbreig**: If you don't mind like putting your email together.
**Kbreig**: That way I have.
**Kbreig**: And I can just fill them in and that way you don't have to mess around.
**Kbreig**: Mess around with it.
**Kbreig**: Obviously I'll be.
**Kbreig**: We'll be talking daily, but yeah, just.
**Kbreig**: We'll just start that thread now and then.
**Kbreig**: Yeah, other than that, we're gonna be.
**Kbreig**: We're gonna be out of there.
**Kbreig**: And I'm glad you guys went with this option, Kelly, because this is the cleanest and the easiest, like.
**Kbreig**: Well, no welding involved.
**Kbreig**: No, no, no.
**Speaker 1**: For sure.
**Kbreig**: It's great.
**Speaker 1**: Well, and it's kind of perfect because that's the week I'll be on site too, so that's great.
**Kbreig**: Oh, even better.
**Kbreig**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, so then do we know.
**Speaker 1**: Has Rogers given you or is that like, where.
**Speaker 1**: Where are these new diffusers going?
**Kbreig**: Yeah, so I requested from Charles yesterday morning to get.
**Kbreig**: We're going to mark up a drawing.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, thank you.
**Speaker 1**: And then get me.
**Kbreig**: And get it back to you.
**Kbreig**: Yeah, I was, I.
**Kbreig**: I was hoping to have it before this meeting.
**Kbreig**: I haven't been able to bump them yet.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Kbreig**: H vac went out at my house and, oh, my wife is 30, 36 weeks pregnant.
**Kbreig**: So I'm like, I've been making calls.
**Speaker 1**: Figure it out.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: To make that work.
**Speaker 1**: That's right.
**Kbreig**: Yeah.
**Kbreig**: Seriously.
**Speaker 1**: So right now, too?
**Kbreig**: It is.
**Kbreig**: Yeah, it is.
**Kbreig**: That being said, I haven't had a chance to connect with them and follow up with them, but I will.
**Kbreig**: And I'll hopefully have that to you today.
**Kbreig**: But yeah, we're just going to mark up a drawing so they know.
**Kbreig**: Kind of general idea on that day four where our lists are going to be.
**Speaker 1**: That's what I was getting at.
**Kbreig**: Yeah, it's minimal.
**Speaker 1**: Like minimal impact compared to everything else we've done.
**Speaker 1**: Very minimal.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, cool.
**Kbreig**: Correct.
**Speaker 1**: Good deal.
**Kbreig**: Does that help?
**Speaker 1**: Yep, this helps.
**Speaker 1**: This gives me what I needed.
**Speaker 1**: I will send this back to operations and then, yeah, once we get a drawing marked up, please send that to me to make sure we're aligned and there's no changes needed and we'll be good to go.
**Kbreig**: Sweet.
**Kbreig**: And I'll let you know when we lock in that crane date.
**Kbreig**: You know, it's a really.
**Kbreig**: It's a really, really big crane.
**Kbreig**: So there will be some.
**Kbreig**: We're going to have to coordinate.
**Kbreig**: Like, hey, we're going to be at this.
**Kbreig**: Like what?
**Kbreig**: Dock door.
**Kbreig**: We need to be exactly, etc.
**Kbreig**: So exactly.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Kbreig**: That's the only other coordination that has to happen that could impact.
**Speaker 1**: We can figure that out.
**Speaker 1**: I think that's an easy one to navigate.
**Kbreig**: Sweet.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Kbreig**: Okay, cool.
**Speaker 1**: Sounds good.
**Kbreig**: Talk to you later.
**Speaker 1**: Thanks, A.J.
