## Transcript
**Skrumenacker**: Hey Justin.
**Jkimmich**: Hey, how are you doing?
**Skrumenacker**: Good, good, good.
**Skrumenacker**: Waiting for Steve to join us here.
**Jkimmich**: Right.
**Skrumenacker**: Let's talk to Brandon.
**Skrumenacker**: So I got a few answers here for you.
**Jkimmich**: Good.
**Skrumenacker**: I don't know if that's a lot, but he was talking about 150 people for the restaurant.
**Jkimmich**: I don't know if that's okay.
**Skrumenacker**: Seems like too many or what.
**Skrumenacker**: So I'd imagine we'd have one elevator go up to the roof and service that area in the restaurant and then another elevator that would just service the the floors.
**Jkimmich**: So would you have the same elevator serve the hotel and the restaurant and then a separate one for the condo?
**Skrumenacker**: No, he said they'll have everything.
**Skrumenacker**: Everything will be shared.
**Jkimmich**: Okay.
**Skrumenacker**: This.
**Skrumenacker**: So they won't have separate anything.
**Skrumenacker**: Hey, Steve.
**Speaker 2**: Hey guys, how are you?
**Jkimmich**: Hey.
**Skrumenacker**: Good.
**Jkimmich**: Nice meeting Steve.
**Skrumenacker**: You too, Justin.
**Skrumenacker**: Justin is Image Smith architect.
**Skrumenacker**: So we're looking to him to the architectural design.
**Skrumenacker**: So Steve is with dci.
**Skrumenacker**: They did some work for us up in Pennsylvania, had a project up there.
**Skrumenacker**: So checking floors is a lot.
**Skrumenacker**: Not as fun as building a hotel, so.
**Speaker 2**: Absolutely, you're right.
**Skrumenacker**: But hey, that's a good.
**Skrumenacker**: Like that same client, we're looking at a project out in Arizona.
**Skrumenacker**: It's a warehouse that they're.
**Skrumenacker**: It's like a million square foot warehouse that they're getting ready for Amazon.
**Jkimmich**: Oh wow.
**Speaker 2**: That they're, they're building.
**Speaker 2**: They're just doing fit out on an existing.
**Skrumenacker**: It's an existing building, but we got to go in.
**Speaker 2**: Okay.
**Skrumenacker**: Like it's, there's not even lights in half the three quarters of the building.
**Skrumenacker**: So a lot of work.
**Speaker 2**: Other conveying systems and everything.
**Speaker 2**: Do you guys do that or does Amazon do that themselves?
**Skrumenacker**: Yeah, we don't do that.
**Skrumenacker**: Yeah, there's companies that do the conveying systems, but we do the interact sprinkler piping and then like we're building offices and break rooms and powered all their material handling equipment, whatnot.
**Skrumenacker**: So.
**Speaker 2**: Gotcha.
**Speaker 2**: Okay.
**Skrumenacker**: So yeah, so yeah, just looking at the project.
**Skrumenacker**: That's why I would ask Justin to join too so we could talk.
**Skrumenacker**: I got a few more details, but I just wanted you guys to talk too about, you know, when we do go to design this, what's the best, most efficient structure and, and thinking about that, you know, once we get, we got to get them all the pricing for the design to get released.
**Skrumenacker**: So.
**Jkimmich**: Yep.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, I think I mentioned in my email to you, I mean I think as long as the code will allow it, which I assume it will for three story that you know Wood frame is typically the cheapest way to build something like that.
**Speaker 2**: But if you're trying to do the pool, I think you said, Jesse, up on the third floor level, you know, you're certainly not going to want to support that on wood framing.
**Speaker 2**: So I think doing that on steel and concrete and then, you know, whether it's wood bearing walls or wood supported by steel around that, for the rest of the hotel, it's going to be the best approach, probably the most economical, again, as long as the code allows it.
**Speaker 2**: So that, that's sort of how I was envisioning it.
**Speaker 2**: But a lot of it depends, as I said in my email, I think, on just the configuration of it, you know.
**Jkimmich**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: What's the configuration of rooms and, you know, the ground floor lobbies and amenity spaces and that type of thing.
**Speaker 2**: So.
**Jkimmich**: So Jesse, I thought you had mentioned three stories of hotel plus condo above that, plus restaurant above that.
**Jkimmich**: So how.
**Jkimmich**: I guess how many units and how high is that driving us?
**Skrumenacker**: So if it's 60 units, like, and 50 of them are hotel and we just do 10 condos.
**Jkimmich**: Oh, okay.
**Skrumenacker**: You know, and they're like 1800 square feet or so.
**Skrumenacker**: Condos.
**Skrumenacker**: We were trying to get it in three floors.
**Skrumenacker**: And then the rooftop being the restaurant and bar.
**Skrumenacker**: Restaurant, pool area.
**Jkimmich**: Okay.
**Speaker 2**: So are you talking, Jesse, the.
**Speaker 2**: So three levels of units.
**Speaker 2**: I'll say three floors of units and then the, the pool and a bar, restaurant on the roof, like open.
**Jkimmich**: On the roof, like the fourth floor, basically.
**Skrumenacker**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: Okay.
**Speaker 2**: Okay.
**Speaker 2**: That was not.
**Speaker 2**: That's not how I'd understood it, but okay, that makes a lot more sense.
**Speaker 2**: But still, you know, still wouldn't change, I think how you'd have to support the, the pool up there.
**Speaker 2**: I think you'd still need some sort of.
**Jkimmich**: So you don't have concrete.
**Jkimmich**: Concrete deck and then steel columns to support that concrete deck.
**Speaker 2**: I would think so.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: Just because you could then isolate it to the pool area.
**Speaker 2**: I mean, you could do.
**Speaker 2**: Even if you have a rooftop bar or restaurant or whatever, you could still do that in wood framing.
**Speaker 2**: Just designed for floor loading and you know, what pavers or whatever you had on top of that.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, but I just think I feel like supporting the.
**Speaker 2**: The pool on.
**Speaker 2**: On wood framing is.
**Jkimmich**: No, that's not a good idea.
**Jkimmich**: So you would do.
**Jkimmich**: You'd have those columns come all the way through and just have the wood framing come up to that deck, maybe?
**Speaker 2**: I would think so.
**Jkimmich**: And yeah, I would love to be able to see that concrete go.
**Jkimmich**: The rest of the roof deck just because of water.
**Jkimmich**: Water intrusion potentials with the, with the walkable service up there.
**Skrumenacker**: Well, one thing too is like opposed to that is somewhat close to the coast and I don't know what the wind loads are and the design are for that there.
**Skrumenacker**: Thinking too of like I think in a hotel like each, each room is, you know, it's a rated compartment, is it not in between room to room.
**Skrumenacker**: So like there.
**Skrumenacker**: I don't know, you know the difference between like even Justin, you mentioned the system like Epicor.
**Skrumenacker**: I don't know how that expensive that is.
**Skrumenacker**: I don't know Steve, if you worked with that before.
**Skrumenacker**: So you know, maybe if we did a masonry like block construction that would support maybe we have concrete floors on each floor with masonry.
**Skrumenacker**: You know, Justin also brought up.
**Skrumenacker**: I don't know if he ever worked with the, the ifc, you know, with the concrete with Styrofoam.
**Jkimmich**: Yeah, yeah.
**Skrumenacker**: I don't know.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, we're doing a project right now with that.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: Yep.
**Jkimmich**: But I guess my concern about have the bearing wall like if you had the same floor plan all the way up, I think that works pretty well those standard hotel.
**Jkimmich**: But if we're switching the top floor to be condo now, which is going to be larger units, more open floor plans and what your bays are for your hotel guest rooms, that that changes it up a little bit.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: I mean I think if you could keep your Carter walls consistent and then just vary your unit to unit walls, you know that would be great.
**Speaker 2**: And I, and I like the idea Justin of doing a.
**Speaker 2**: Or of doing like masonry walls and either Epicor.
**Speaker 2**: There's names escaping me.
**Speaker 2**: There's another kind of long span deck system that you can use.
**Speaker 2**: There's concrete plank.
**Speaker 2**: You know, I mean that's a tried and true sort of system.
**Speaker 2**: And certainly you could do any of.
**Jkimmich**: Those.
**Speaker 2**: With the pool.
**Speaker 2**: You know they're not.
**Speaker 2**: They would be good approaches for the pool because you can just design for whatever those loads are.
**Jkimmich**: So you'd be okay doing the pool on the, on the masonry bearing walls?
**Speaker 2**: Sure.
**Jkimmich**: Let me know.
**Jkimmich**: Oh, okay.
**Jkimmich**: I wasn't sure if that was going to be a good solution or not.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, no, I think that would be fine.
**Speaker 2**: I'm just, I would be more concerned about obviously the load, the weight of the pool, but also the, you know, moisture.
**Jkimmich**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: As try as you might to get it watertight, it's.
**Speaker 2**: There's always the potential for something and you certainly don't want that little bit of leaking starting to compromise your structure immediately once it hits the Wood it will, but not with.
**Speaker 2**: Not with something else.
**Speaker 2**: So.
**Speaker 2**: But yeah, one of those is.
**Speaker 2**: Would certainly be a good solution and can, you know, can be designed for whatever loads you need it to.
**Speaker 2**: For the pool or for the roof deck.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: There's other systems too, that Jesse, that you could.
**Speaker 2**: That you could look at.
**Speaker 2**: They're not.
**Speaker 2**: I mean, again, wood is going to be the most economical, I think, you know, a masonry bearing wall or even frankly metal stud bearing wall with concrete plank or the Epicore with the other deck system that I'm thinking of.
**Speaker 2**: You know, those are.
**Speaker 2**: That's an option too and would give you the ability to potentially like panelize the metal stud walls and prefab them, set them on site.
**Speaker 2**: You know, we've done that as well for.
**Speaker 2**: For up to, you know, we've done that up to seven or eight stories.
**Speaker 2**: I think a little bit more economical, a little bit quicker construction than masonry and get you that a little more durability than the.
**Speaker 2**: Than the wood as well.
**Skrumenacker**: Okay.
**Jkimmich**: Do you have a concrete floor with the panelized metal wall?
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, the Epicore would work with that or the.
**Speaker 2**: Sorry, I'm going to try and find what that.
**Speaker 2**: The name of that concrete is.
**Speaker 2**: It's driving me nuts.
**Speaker 2**: But it's just like the Epicore.
**Speaker 2**: It's like a deep deck.
**Speaker 2**: I think their deck is.
**Speaker 2**: They have one that's four and a half inches thick.
**Speaker 2**: They have one that's eight inches thick.
**Speaker 2**: And it just gives you the ability to span further without having to shore it.
**Speaker 2**: But it works with steel, it works with masonry, it works with metal stud bearing walls.
**Speaker 2**: So they're.
**Speaker 2**: Both of them are really just a replacement or an alternate to concrete plank, which would also work for it.
**Speaker 2**: So.
**Skrumenacker**: Is there any.
**Skrumenacker**: Is it like a lightweight concrete you use with that system?
**Jkimmich**: No, that is lightweight Epicore.
**Speaker 2**: No, it's not lightweight with the Epicore.
**Jkimmich**: Yeah, that's standard, I think.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Jkimmich**: The other thing too, I've heard stories of moisture getting into the hollow core pores and causing problems too.
**Jkimmich**: So this would.
**Jkimmich**: That that system could potentially eliminate that concern.
**Speaker 2**: Right, right, right.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: For the pool.
**Speaker 2**: I mean, certainly exterior.
**Speaker 2**: Any type of exterior conditions, we wouldn't do concrete plank.
**Speaker 2**: It's called com slab is the other.
**Speaker 2**: The other system.
**Speaker 2**: CO M Slab.
**Speaker 2**: Again, it's the same sort of deck and poured concrete as the Epicore.
**Skrumenacker**: Okay.
**Skrumenacker**: And you found the most.
**Skrumenacker**: The cost efficient is the metal stud comboed with a Epicore system or something.
**Speaker 2**: More so than maybe.
**Speaker 2**: And again, much quicker to.
**Speaker 2**: Much quicker to.
**Speaker 2**: To.
**Speaker 2**: To install because you could Like I said, you could prefab them, panelize them, and ship them onto the site with openings and you know, just pre made panels.
**Speaker 2**: And then so it's really like a, like a set.
**Speaker 2**: You know, you set, you set the walls, you set a floor, you set the walls, you set a floor.
**Jkimmich**: Do they do the shop drawings for you for that panel system or how do you need to set it up as a design package from our side, like you and I, how do we get that to them?
**Speaker 2**: I mean, typically we would.
**Speaker 2**: I don't know what you see, Justin.
**Speaker 2**: A lot of times we like our metal stud design would end up being what we delegated design, where the, you know, the, the carpentry contractor, metal sled contractor would hire an engineer to do that.
**Speaker 2**: That design.
**Speaker 2**: Truthfully, we, we do that because whether we design it or don't design it, they design it.
**Speaker 2**: So we started saying, well, let's save ourselves some time and not design it and then check their design and fight with them about the design.
**Speaker 2**: So we could certainly do the design.
**Speaker 2**: Jesse, as long as, as lays, as long as your contractor understands we did the design and they're not going to redesign it, you know, but so we typically, Justin would design the members and then the, the sub would just basically go to whoever they're buying it from.
**Speaker 2**: They or some of the subs themselves will prefabricate the panels with whatever the studs that are designed are.
**Jkimmich**: Okay.
**Jkimmich**: So they, they work out some modularity.
**Jkimmich**: They work out what works for them.
**Jkimmich**: Okay, Right.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, it's really just a, becomes just a stud layout thing more than, you know, the design of the studs and the tracks and everything.
**Speaker 2**: Right, got it.
**Speaker 2**: Right, yep.
**Skrumenacker**: And does that work?
**Skrumenacker**: If we make like the first floor, we want to have like 14 foot to the deck, say just so that the entry lobby and all that can have high ceilings and whatnot.
**Skrumenacker**: That works.
**Skrumenacker**: So works with that system.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Speaker 2**: And oftentimes you have a, you know, you'd have some elements of structural steel like I said at the, at the lobby or at the amenity space or, or a breakfast bars, you know, some, something like that, where you don't want the bearing walls, you'd have some pieces of structural steel there.
**Speaker 2**: And upon the configuration, sometimes they'll build that structural steel into their panels, you know, depending on where it is.
**Speaker 2**: Obviously if it's just in an open space, that's not in a panel, but, but that all becomes, you know, just say however you want to procure the various packages.
**Skrumenacker**: Okay.
**Skrumenacker**: And then when it Comes to like we're talking for yet on like if we figured for 150 person max capacity of the restaurant that's on the roof, does that like then that design for all that added load goes all the way down to the, to the wall.
**Speaker 2**: Through the walls, correct?
**Speaker 2**: Yep.
**Skrumenacker**: Okay.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: But at three story it's not, you know, you could probably get away with 6 inch walls from a capacity standpoint.
**Speaker 2**: And I say it that way because for example, if you wanted to use an 8 inch concrete plank, like a prefab precast concrete plank, the clearances that they want for like or tolerances, I should say for their erection, they would really want an 8 inch wall thickness to sit it on because they need, I think it's like two and a half inches of bearing on each side.
**Speaker 2**: So if you figure it's two and a half and two and a half and they all have an inch clear with the, with the six inch stud, it sometimes it, it gets a little bit tight for them to make a 6 inch stud work.
**Speaker 2**: So I know they prefer an 8 inch stud, but generally from a loading standpoint you could probably make a 6 inch stud work.
**Skrumenacker**: Okay.
**Skrumenacker**: All right.
**Speaker 2**: But yeah, that might be, that might be a good approach.
**Speaker 2**: Again, it's probably not as economical as just wood frame construction throughout, but to me it accommodates a lot more of what the building is.
**Speaker 2**: And frankly if it's condos, it's.
**Speaker 2**: I don't know.
**Speaker 2**: To me it's a better product for a condo as well.
**Jkimmich**: So.
**Jkimmich**: Yeah.
**Skrumenacker**: And then at the roof level would we be able to.
**Skrumenacker**: Then I'm envisioning you'd have really two different deck heights up there.
**Skrumenacker**: You'd have the restaurant floor level.
**Skrumenacker**: And then everything else on your amenity deck is depressed for your waterproofing and your, your tile or whatever else goes out there.
**Skrumenacker**: And that would just be a matter of the layout of the walls below to do that offset.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, they would just step the height of the walls.
**Speaker 2**: Right, right.
**Jkimmich**: And then the pool, I would imagine, because we do have units below, you'd probably kind of step up for the pool on top of that deck.
**Jkimmich**: Have a built up pool deck?
**Jkimmich**: More or less.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, I was thinking the same thing too.
**Speaker 2**: Is it a.
**Speaker 2**: You know, sometimes you'll drop the, down the pool down into the roof and you just walk right into it like a, like a typical on gray pool.
**Speaker 2**: But oftentimes on the roof you do it.
**Speaker 2**: So you're stepping up to it.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, that would certainly be simpler in this application.
**Skrumenacker**: Well, there again if we have Say, you know, you got to say 14 for level one and then the roof or the level three, you'd have to put like a 12 foot ceiling at least.
**Skrumenacker**: So if you're dropping your pool structure down three foot or whatever, you make that up there somehow where you get at least maybe there's eight foot ceilings across there in that area and still allow for, you know, some of these are like a penthouse type condo that's on that floor that.
**Jkimmich**: Yeah.
**Skrumenacker**: The higher ceilings and other spots.
**Jkimmich**: Yeah.
**Jkimmich**: I would think with the top level being condos, you'd want it all to have maybe 10 foot ceilings, 9 to 10 foot.
**Jkimmich**: Probably dropping that pool down.
**Jkimmich**: You've got the pool, the pool structure and then any secondary because pools leak.
**Jkimmich**: So you want to have something else under there and then just the, the infrastructure of that, the pipes and whatnot.
**Jkimmich**: So you'd be under the pool, you'd be, you know, limited.
**Jkimmich**: But then the other units could have even higher ceilings, which if it's a too small of a space, it may not make sense anyway to go more than that.
**Jkimmich**: But you've got.
**Jkimmich**: It just seems like it would be simpler from a waterproofing standpoint too.
**Jkimmich**: You have your flat concrete deck and then you come up and you could landscape that nice.
**Jkimmich**: You could create some built in benches and seating.
**Jkimmich**: You could do something nice up there still without it feeling like, oh, there's a big gray wall of China here, what's up there, you know, because it's not going to be that deep any, but it does give some additional separation and allows for nice ceilings throughout the whole of the condo floor.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, yeah, I would agree with you.
**Speaker 2**: And frankly, Jesse, not to, not to be a sort of a Debbie Downer, but you know, condos are generally pretty litigious.
**Speaker 2**: So I think we want to try and, you know, we would probably want to take the safest approach to not having water leaking because those condo associations are generally, you know, if you talk to, you know, your, your.
**Speaker 2**: Well, for us, our, you know, insurance people, they're like, nope, you know, you need to, you need to be very careful with your agreements for condos.
**Speaker 2**: So.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: Something we should all be mindful of.
**Jkimmich**: Yeah, yeah.
**Skrumenacker**: It almost.
**Skrumenacker**: Yeah.
**Skrumenacker**: Last two big projects I did were condos.
**Skrumenacker**: So all about waterproofing.
**Skrumenacker**: Litigious things.
**Speaker 2**: Yes, yes, yes.
**Speaker 2**: Yep.
**Speaker 2**: Yep.
**Skrumenacker**: It's a nightmare.
**Skrumenacker**: The last one, we put the pool above sections of the parking deck and it's still.
**Skrumenacker**: It was, it was a problem.
**Speaker 2**: Really.
**Skrumenacker**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: So.
**Skrumenacker**: Okay.
**Jkimmich**: Yeah.
**Skrumenacker**: Is there anything else?
**Skrumenacker**: I just want to like anything you Know if you guys like just to coordinate because we're just breaking the surface here of getting started and you know, getting on the same mindset in the beginning's very important.
**Skrumenacker**: And you know, we don't have as much information for you guys as we should, but you know, hopefully it's enough to get.
**Skrumenacker**: I mean, I got your price, Steve, so Justin, you can get me here as soon as possible.
**Skrumenacker**: That's just what we need to get released and.
**Jkimmich**: Yep.
**Jkimmich**: So I'm seeing.
**Jkimmich**: We'll grab MEP interiors and waterproofing.
**Jkimmich**: And I'm seeing it.
**Jkimmich**: A four story building, first floor is going to have your lobby and you said probably a breakfast area.
**Jkimmich**: Is that just gonna be like a warming kind of kitchen on the first floor for breakfast?
**Skrumenacker**: I'm sure, yeah.
**Skrumenacker**: Whatever they do not like a full.
**Jkimmich**: Full restaurant.
**Jkimmich**: Just a warming.
**Jkimmich**: Okay.
**Skrumenacker**: And then I'll probably have a coffee shop down there too.
**Jkimmich**: Okay.
**Jkimmich**: Like a, like a, like a, like a public coffee shop or just like a coffee area for a hotel.
**Skrumenacker**: I mean they're gonna have out in the food court, there's a coffee shop that they plan for.
**Skrumenacker**: So forget that.
**Skrumenacker**: If they want that, we'll just, we'll add that later.
**Jkimmich**: Okay.
**Jkimmich**: And then we've got two.
**Jkimmich**: Two floors of hotel.
**Jkimmich**: We'll look at the standards in terms of split and.
**Jkimmich**: And typology.
**Jkimmich**: 10 condos on the top floor, about 1800 square feet.
**Jkimmich**: And then your restaurant above for 150 people have some outdoor space.
**Jkimmich**: Your pool, spa also, or no spot.
**Skrumenacker**: I don't think though.
**Skrumenacker**: Or like a hot tub, you mean?
**Jkimmich**: Right.
**Skrumenacker**: They probably would want one.
**Skrumenacker**: I think it gets cold in Georgia once in a while.
**Jkimmich**: Nice hot tub on cold Georgia night.
**Jkimmich**: I feel like that should be a country song.
**Jkimmich**: I don't know.
**Speaker 2**: I'm sure it is.
**Jkimmich**: They will be soon.
**Speaker 2**: About beer and jeans too.
**Speaker 2**: Somebody in jeans.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: And.
**Jkimmich**: Okay.
**Jkimmich**: I think that gives me what I'm looking for for now.
**Jkimmich**: If I have any other questions, I'll let you know.
**Jkimmich**: But I'll break it out across services and, and the design phases.
**Skrumenacker**: It sounds like.
**Speaker 2**: Just so I'm clear.
**Speaker 2**: I'm sorry, that.
**Speaker 2**: So we have the.
**Speaker 2**: You said there's a restaurant at the.
**Speaker 2**: What I guess would be the fourth floor level.
**Speaker 2**: Right.
**Speaker 2**: And that's like partial footprint, but enclosed.
**Speaker 2**: Right.
**Speaker 2**: We're not talking about an open air.
**Speaker 2**: Okay.
**Skrumenacker**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: And then the amenity pool and whatever roof deck on the rest of it.
**Speaker 2**: Gotcha.
**Speaker 2**: Okay.
**Skrumenacker**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: And I, you know, you said that 1800 square foot for 10 condos.
**Speaker 2**: But the, the Site plan you had sent it was like 11, 11 7, 11,700 square foot footprint.
**Speaker 2**: So obviously half of the.
**Skrumenacker**: And maybe that works too.
**Skrumenacker**: Or if we're worried about height is half of it.
**Skrumenacker**: That's condos is on the side with tall ceilings.
**Skrumenacker**: And the half with hotels, it can be lower ceilings would be where the pool is.
**Skrumenacker**: Then we wouldn't worry about the water as much being over top of condos.
**Jkimmich**: So not taking up the whole, whole floor.
**Jkimmich**: So I guess like what Steve's saying, if we take that 11,000 square foot that showed on the site plan and.
**Skrumenacker**: Is that what it ends up being?
**Jkimmich**: 11,710.
**Jkimmich**: So if I just for giggle said 15 efficiency or 85 of that, saying the rest of it's whatever space, divide that by 10.
**Jkimmich**: It's only 995 square feet per condo.
**Jkimmich**: So we have five condos or higher.
**Skrumenacker**: Do we have enough room in this building like maybe to do all this?
**Jkimmich**: I don't know.
**Jkimmich**: I haven't started.
**Jkimmich**: I just now heard what your program was.
**Jkimmich**: So I haven't started looking at it all.
**Jkimmich**: But just thinking 10 condos, 1800 square feet, that was an easy look.
**Jkimmich**: But if you were to go let's say 11, 7, 10 times two floors and let's say you take out the lobby and the other stuff.
**Jkimmich**: So maybe it's instead of 85, let's just call it 70%.
**Jkimmich**: That's only 16,000 square feet.
**Jkimmich**: So if you divide that by, I don't know, an average of, I don't know, 325 square feet or small thing.
**Jkimmich**: Yeah, you're 50.
**Jkimmich**: But that's again just rough numbers because of how you're going to lay it out.
**Skrumenacker**: Okay, let me see something here.
**Jkimmich**: So I think the, the 50 hotel rooms probably closer to working.
**Jkimmich**: Are you.
**Jkimmich**: Do you know if they want a, a linen shoot?
**Jkimmich**: Do they have laundry on site or they do valet and they just take it down in their bins.
**Skrumenacker**: Yeah, they just use carts.
**Jkimmich**: Okay.
**Skrumenacker**: For that.
**Jkimmich**: And then.
**Jkimmich**: And no trash chute for the condo or restaurant.
**Skrumenacker**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: No.
**Skrumenacker**: Yeah, we just, we wouldn't put a trash chute in.
**Skrumenacker**: Yeah.
**Skrumenacker**: So maybe we need to go one more floor to get.
**Jkimmich**: Yeah.
**Jkimmich**: If you want the 10 condos or.
**Skrumenacker**: Increase the footprint just a little bit to get.
**Skrumenacker**: So you would need.
**Jkimmich**: So if you had 1800 square feet times 10 times 1.15 for efficiency, you need about 20,000 square feet.
**Jkimmich**: So that's more than a little bit on one floor.
**Skrumenacker**: Well, let me.
**Skrumenacker**: Yeah.
**Jkimmich**: Probably solve your.
**Jkimmich**: Yeah, you probably solve your problem.
**Jkimmich**: If you go up another floor, does that, would that change anything we just talked about, Steve, in terms of bearing and load and systems.
**Speaker 2**: Okay.
**Speaker 2**: Makes it, it probably makes it.
**Speaker 2**: You know, you're starting to veer away from wood being more economical.
**Speaker 2**: Probably.
**Jkimmich**: Yeah.
**Jkimmich**: And the taller you go now you've got rated exterior walls and things of that nature too to keep in mind.
**Jkimmich**: That have to be addressed in some fashion.
**Skrumenacker**: Right, Right.
**Skrumenacker**: Is it after four levels or what's the height?
**Jkimmich**: Depends on the construction type.
**Jkimmich**: Let me look real quick.
**Speaker 2**: And the, and the height of the building.
**Speaker 2**: Right.
**Speaker 2**: I think I forget what the height.
**Jkimmich**: Is, but.
**Speaker 2**: Certainly not over five stories as wood.
**Speaker 2**: Depending upon the square footage.
**Speaker 2**: I think it's probably, it's.
**Speaker 2**: It can be forced at times.
**Skrumenacker**: I'm just a little prejudiced.
**Skrumenacker**: I don't like wood construction, so.
**Jkimmich**: Yeah, I agree.
**Skrumenacker**: It's okay.
**Skrumenacker**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Jkimmich**: Yep.
**Skrumenacker**: Although, did you see.
**Skrumenacker**: I seen something on LinkedIn.
**Skrumenacker**: They said these engineers at, I don't know, some college, they've.
**Skrumenacker**: They have this wood engineer, like some treatment they put in it.
**Skrumenacker**: They said it's five times stronger than steel.
**Speaker 2**: Oh, really?
**Skrumenacker**: Wood?
**Skrumenacker**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: I hadn't heard that.
**Jkimmich**: I saw something, honestly, I think I saw that same kind of thing.
**Jkimmich**: Oh, man.
**Speaker 2**: Guys, I apologize.
**Speaker 2**: I have to.
**Speaker 2**: I have somebody waiting for me for a 3:30 meeting.
**Speaker 2**: But you're good.
**Speaker 2**: So should we just assume same foot?
**Speaker 2**: Do you want us to do that or you want to confirm and, and just let me know.
**Skrumenacker**: I would take another floor because this doesn't sound like.
**Skrumenacker**: Because each like a hotel tow room.
**Skrumenacker**: Is it 3 to 400 square foot is like a minimum?
**Jkimmich**: It depends.
**Jkimmich**: I mean if you're 12 foot by 20 foot, let's say it's 240 square feet.
**Jkimmich**: So you're probably between 250, 300 on a standard like smaller.
**Jkimmich**: I don't know what their, what the reverb standards are, but 300, we'll look into that.
**Skrumenacker**: Okay.
**Skrumenacker**: That would get us.
**Skrumenacker**: Okay, so we can fit all the hotels in at 300 square feet because you put some on level one.
**Skrumenacker**: Some.
**Jkimmich**: Yeah.
**Jkimmich**: The rest would be on level two.
**Jkimmich**: And level three is going to be.
**Jkimmich**: Three and four now are going to be condo and then five is going to be your restaurant and pool.
**Speaker 2**: Justin, you're figuring that same square footage though, right?
**Speaker 2**: The footprint?
**Speaker 2**: I should say for now.
**Jkimmich**: For now I'm going to say, I think to get something moving, put some guardrails up, describe it and we'll keep the same footprint and we'll, we'll just add another floor on yeah.
**Speaker 2**: Floor plus the restaurant above.
**Jkimmich**: Right.
**Jkimmich**: So now it's a five story instead of a four story.
**Skrumenacker**: Yep.
**Speaker 2**: Okay, perfect.
**Speaker 2**: So, Jesse, I'll revise our.
**Speaker 2**: Our number and.
**Speaker 2**: And get that to you based on that.
**Speaker 2**: So.
**Skrumenacker**: Okay.
**Skrumenacker**: All right.
**Skrumenacker**: Thanks, Steve.
**Speaker 2**: Thanks, guys.
**Jkimmich**: Jess.
**Jkimmich**: Thanks, guys.
**Speaker 2**: Nice meeting you.
**Speaker 2**: Take care.
**Jkimmich**: Take care.
