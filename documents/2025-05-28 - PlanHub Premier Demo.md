## Transcript
**Mmoro**: So it's okay.
**Mcalcetero**: All good?
**Speaker 2**: Very good.
**Mmoro**: Yes, very good.
**Speaker 2**: I was a stay.
**Speaker 2**: I was a stay at home dad for many years.
**Speaker 2**: So I did the two girls and a boy.
**Mcalcetero**: Oh, exactly.
**Mcalcetero**: Well, you know what it is.
**Speaker 2**: I do for sure.
**Mcalcetero**: Awesome.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay, guys, so this is for Plan Hop, Correct.
**Mcalcetero**: I was stalking you on the website.
**Mmoro**: Yeah, we get that a lot.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, I'm just kind of like intrigued of, you know, what is the plan and everything.
**Mcalcetero**: I know you guys wanted to, you know, show this to Brandon.
**Mcalcetero**: So definitely I'm just going to talk to him about this and the team in general.
**Mcalcetero**: So let's just start with it.
**Mmoro**: Sure.
**Mmoro**: I'll go ahead and jump into it.
**Mmoro**: Matt, are you going to stay on?
**Speaker 2**: I'll just stand for a little bit.
**Speaker 2**: I do have another meeting.
**Speaker 2**: But Maria, I'm always available.
**Speaker 2**: And that's the one good thing about Plan Hub too is you do have live people that you can reach all the time.
**Speaker 2**: And we're always here for you.
**Mcalcetero**: Awesome.
**Mcalcetero**: Thank you, Mari.
**Mcalcetero**: Thank you so much.
**Mmoro**: Yeah, you, you literally have somebody you can text at any time.
**Mmoro**: You'll get a response, which is nice to have.
**Mmoro**: O.
**Mmoro**: So Plan Hub, you guys are general contractors, correct?
**Mmoro**: The company?
**Mcalcetero**: Correct, correct.
**Mmoro**: Really, it's just to kind of start from the beginning, right?
**Mmoro**: It's really kind of twofold when it comes to gcs, right.
**Mmoro**: We have a vast network of subcontractors that have signed up.
**Mmoro**: That was kind of the core of where we started.
**Mmoro**: And you on the GC side, we, you know, you can communicate with them as far as you can post jobs to get to them.
**Mmoro**: You can look them up directly.
**Mmoro**: They have all their pre qual information in there, right.
**Mmoro**: They're all self registers, they're all signed up.
**Mmoro**: And that's a, that was kind of the core component when we started, right?
**Mmoro**: It's just finding a great easy way to connect you with subcontractors.
**Mmoro**: It's grown beyond that right, over the years as we grew, you know, the product required us to add new things the GCs were requesting.
**Mmoro**: So there's a takeoff software, right?
**Mmoro**: There's, there's bid leveling and more of, you know, ability to really manage the bids and, you know, create a quote and send it to owners and that sort of thing.
**Mmoro**: And then there's the leads aspect is probably the other big part of it.
**Mmoro**: I don't know if that's part of the main interest, but it's, you know, it's, it's, it's unique.
**Mmoro**: It's, you know, it's a set of leads that we only sell to general contractors.
**Mmoro**: We don't sell them to anybody else.
**Mmoro**: We sell these to subcontractors.
**Mmoro**: But those come from you, right?
**Mmoro**: You would go on there, you would post a project, that's what we sell them.
**Mmoro**: But these, they're.
**Mmoro**: It's all private work based, you know, we get them to you as early in the process as we can to try to help you connect with these owners and architects, developers as early as possible.
**Mcalcetero**: Wonderful.
**Mmoro**: Yeah.
**Mmoro**: Is that.
**Mmoro**: What type of work do y' all do typically?
**Mcalcetero**: So, you know, probably like one Hub is.
**Mcalcetero**: And actually I just have a question.
**Mcalcetero**: So we usually use a platform for Job Planner.
**Mcalcetero**: I don't know if you're familiar with it.
**Mcalcetero**: And also Procore.
**Mcalcetero**: So those different applications are the one that we are getting, you know, so concepts and everything.
**Mcalcetero**: And we are actually connecting them to, you know, to our main platform.
**Mcalcetero**: So what we do is, you know, we just do the commercial construction and then the idea is just, for example, we have a project we just put on your planner and then we just start organizing everything.
**Mcalcetero**: We use Notion as well as one of the applications to have everything organized.
**Mcalcetero**: And then one.
**Mmoro**: Yeah, sorry, you have a lot of softwares.
**Mcalcetero**: Yes.
**Mcalcetero**: And then once it's there.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, yeah.
**Mcalcetero**: And obviously, you know, Brandon and the company is very improv, the automation type of thing.
**Mcalcetero**: We kind of like, like the programs and the platforms that can help us move faster and you know, help us with not doing the, the heavy work all the time so we can actually move forward with different projects.
**Mcalcetero**: So once the project is on Job Planner, we just start implementing, you know, what do we need and organization and everything.
**Mcalcetero**: And then we just start.
**Mcalcetero**: Look, we have an estimator that actually starts searching for the SOPs to, you know, for the type of work.
**Mcalcetero**: So I was looking at your platform and do you have like an actual demo of, you know, of the Plan Hub?
**Mcalcetero**: I would love to see that.
**Mmoro**: Yeah, I was going to show it to you.
**Mcalcetero**: Thank you, Steve.
**Mmoro**: I just wanted to give you a review in the first place.
**Mmoro**: So where do you think we fit into that kind of software bundle?
**Mmoro**: Are you looking to potentially replace some of the systems you already use?
**Mcalcetero**: So right now.
**Mcalcetero**: So Job Planner and Procore, they actually work pretty well.
**Mcalcetero**: I know we have some issues sometimes with Job Planner.
**Mcalcetero**: So maybe Plan Hub will be one of the options that we can, you know, doing Setup Planner or we can actually integrate both.
**Mcalcetero**: You were talking that we can connect with other general contractors as well.
**Mcalcetero**: So, you know, that'll be actually really cool to do.
**Mcalcetero**: And then Yeah, I mean, if we can actually use one hub for another type of thing, like you were saying, you were saying that you sell, you know, the lids and everything.
**Mcalcetero**: So that's awesome.
**Mcalcetero**: We can actually see that as well.
**Mcalcetero**: So.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, I mean, I just am interested, you know, and to see also how we can fit it and if it's, if it's really good to replace one of the platforms, I mean, it'll be good to do that as well.
**Mcalcetero**: So.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay, we can always check.
**Mmoro**: Let's do it.
**Mmoro**: So I'm going to start with the leads portion because logically, right.
**Mmoro**: Leads come first, so I'll do that.
**Mmoro**: Is it just Indiana you guys typically build in?
**Mcalcetero**: So we are nationwide, but right now our main office is Indiana and another office is in Florida, but we are nationwide, so we actually do construction all United States.
**Mcalcetero**: But let's, let's just use Indiana as an example.
**Mmoro**: So I'm set to Indiana.
**Mmoro**: You can see my screen.
**Mmoro**: Okay.
**Mmoro**: Correct.
**Mcalcetero**: Yes, sorry.
**Mcalcetero**: Yes, I can see your screen.
**Mmoro**: Okay.
**Mmoro**: Indiana.
**Mmoro**: I'm also going to put on budgeting and planning because those are the newest ones that don't have DCS on them yet.
**Mmoro**: And then private work, because that's 98% of it anyway.
**Mmoro**: That's kind of my general starting point.
**Mmoro**: Within that, there's 318 leads in the state of Indiana.
**Mmoro**: Okay.
**Mmoro**: So the Spreadwood Apartments one.
**Mmoro**: Let's see here.
**Mmoro**: So preliminary plat request, planning and zoning meeting.
**Mmoro**: Okay.
**Mmoro**: It's a one to $10 million job.
**Mmoro**: It's new construction.
**Mmoro**: They don't have the GC yet.
**Mmoro**: Typically they negotiate their work up front.
**Mmoro**: There's the organization and then there's Greg, your developer and your civil engineer.
**Mmoro**: Structure wise, that's a pretty typical lead you're going to see on here.
**Mmoro**: It's limited information.
**Mmoro**: Because the information is limited.
**Mmoro**: It's very early in the process.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay.
**Mmoro**: And we provide the contacts and you essentially reach out directly from here, talk to them about the project.
**Mmoro**: Right.
**Mmoro**: It's.
**Mmoro**: It's very straightforward.
**Mmoro**: You know, sometimes I frame it as we're working as, you know, a leg of your business development to a point.
**Mmoro**: Right.
**Mmoro**: We go out, we find the projects, we bring them back to you, and then you reach out from there.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay.
**Mmoro**: So you're also able.
**Mmoro**: Pretty much everything down here is also what you can filter by.
**Mmoro**: Right.
**Mmoro**: There's seven or eight filters up here.
**Mmoro**: You can do specific building types, project types, as far as new construction or renovation.
**Mmoro**: You know, project value is a popular one.
**Mmoro**: If you want to aim for any specific ones, those, anything you want Me to narrow it down within those.
**Mcalcetero**: So I see the value construct.
**Mcalcetero**: Can you click on construction type?
**Mcalcetero**: What type of.
**Mmoro**: No, it's just, that's just really the.
**Mcalcetero**: Oh just a commercial residential.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay, gotcha.
**Mcalcetero**: Traders.
**Mcalcetero**: No, I mean so let's, let's set an example.
**Mcalcetero**: So for example, you, you mentioned Redwood requirements at Franklin.
**Mcalcetero**: So now that we have these, you said I can connect with the civil engineer, the developer and then move forward with them.
**Mmoro**: Correct.
**Mmoro**: So this is pretty much as far as we get you as far as the you know, getting started with the project.
**Mmoro**: Right.
**Mmoro**: We give you the contacts, you take it out from there, you have that discussion directly with them.
**Mmoro**: Now once.
**Mmoro**: Right.
**Mmoro**: You and Greg agree on.
**Mmoro**: Yes, you know, we'll let you bid on this project or they send you plans or however they do it.
**Mmoro**: Then we kind of come back into the process if you'd like us to as far as the subcontractors go.
**Mmoro**: So.
**Mcalcetero**: Gotcha.
**Mcalcetero**: And then once.
**Mcalcetero**: So for example I have.
**Mcalcetero**: With the contact with Greg.
**Mcalcetero**: Right, you said.
**Mcalcetero**: And then once I have.
**Mcalcetero**: You said that you sell these leads, correct?
**Mmoro**: Yes ma' am.
**Mmoro**: It's part of the paid membership.
**Mmoro**: Yeah.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay, so we'll just click on pricing later.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay, sounds good.
**Mmoro**: Yeah.
**Mmoro**: And then for the subcontractor piece, right there's this.
**Mmoro**: We only sell this nationwide, so that's kind of nice for you.
**Mmoro**: There's 342,000 of them nationwide companies.
**Mmoro**: Every single one of them you'll see in here is self registered.
**Mmoro**: They all came to Plan Hub at some point and signed up on their own accord.
**Mmoro**: What's your zip code there?
**Mcalcetero**: 46250.
**Mmoro**: To give you an example, within 50 miles of you there is 2,464 subcontractors.
**Mmoro**: They're sorted by most active.
**Mmoro**: So the ones that are using Plan Hub the most will automatically float to the top.
**Mmoro**: You know, you can then narrow it down by electrical, plumbing, that sort of thing.
**Mmoro**: And this is the most direct way to get to them.
**Mmoro**: Right.
**Mmoro**: If you needed like a one off, you know, electrician or plumber, whatever it may be, you could go right into the directory, look them up.
**Mmoro**: Take Intercom Electric here I can see there.
**Mmoro**: Okay.
**Mmoro**: They've got a pre qual form filled out.
**Mmoro**: They're paying for Plan Hub.
**Mmoro**: They're insured, bonded license, non union.
**Mmoro**: When I click on them, it'll give me a little more information about it as far as regions they work in.
**Mmoro**: You know, it'll have their pre qual form in here.
**Mmoro**: It'll have all of their users in Here pretty much every piece of information they've ever put in Plan Hub you will have access to.
**Mmoro**: But then that's the most direct way.
**Mmoro**: But it's not really the most efficient way.
**Mmoro**: We also give you the ability to post projects similar to Pro course posting system.
**Mmoro**: I'm not really familiar with the other software.
**Mmoro**: Yeah, but we do, we do get a lot of people that use us in conjunction with procore because you know, procore doesn't do really a great job as far as finding you new people to work with.
**Mmoro**: It's very good at sending to the people you already know.
**Mmoro**: So if you had a new project and you wanted to find new subcontractors, you would simply click on post a project.
**Mmoro**: It does give you the option for public or private.
**Mmoro**: Private would be more of like a procore setup.
**Mmoro**: It's people, it's very controlled environment.
**Mmoro**: You're only inviting subs you already know and already have the contact info for.
**Mmoro**: Right.
**Mmoro**: Public's the one that's going to actually match it against our database.
**Mmoro**: It's going to take the zip code and the trades you tell us you need bids for and invite anyone in our subcontractor network that matches that criteria.
**Mmoro**: From there it's a really simple four step process.
**Mmoro**: Name, address, zip code, dates you need the bids by and construction type.
**Mmoro**: There's five of them that's broken down the next step and then from there, right, status wise there's only two that are ever really used.
**Mmoro**: GC and sub bidding.
**Mmoro**: It's saying, right, there's multiple GCs, GC awarded.
**Mmoro**: It's already your project.
**Mmoro**: You're just looking for subs project type.
**Mmoro**: You can do multiples here.
**Mmoro**: So you can do new construction and demolition and then project building use.
**Mmoro**: This is based on me picking commercial in the first step.
**Mmoro**: So it's all the commercial and there is a.
**Mmoro**: Right, a free version of this.
**Mmoro**: The leads are always going to be part of the paid service.
**Mmoro**: It's just kind of an add on.
**Mmoro**: But then there is.
**Mmoro**: You do have the ability to post jobs for free anywhere in the country and it will find you subcontractors.
**Mmoro**: I'll get so correct.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay, so let's say I post this project public and then the subcontract will see this project and then they will apply to this project or how does it work?
**Mmoro**: Correct?
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, they apply for it.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay, gotcha.
**Mcalcetero**: So they said I want to work for this project.
**Mmoro**: Correct.
**Mmoro**: So if you click here's your trades.
**Mmoro**: Right.
**Mmoro**: If you click tile roof, any subcontractor that's in our directory.
**Mmoro**: That said, I do tile roof and I work in that zip code, gets an invite.
**Mmoro**: But then that invite, they'll be able to click on it, go in the project, see your plans, and then you can sell you their bidding.
**Mmoro**: They can send you a bid directly through Plan Hub if they want to.
**Mmoro**: They can send your RFIs whatever they want to do, or they can.
**Mmoro**: They'll have your emails and phone numbers.
**Mmoro**: They can just contact you directly if they want to.
**Mcalcetero**: Gotcha.
**Mcalcetero**: So you guys are the facilitators between, you know, the SOPs and the project.
**Mmoro**: It's almost like a construction style.
**Mmoro**: LinkedIn.
**Mcalcetero**: Gotcha.
**Mcalcetero**: So.
**Mcalcetero**: So the company and the SOP, the SOPs, they need to be part of Blondhop.
**Mmoro**: Correct.
**Mmoro**: To see your plans.
**Mmoro**: Yes.
**Mmoro**: You can't invite them.
**Mcalcetero**: Gotcha.
**Mmoro**: But then to actually see the plans, they'll have to register.
**Mmoro**: Now, anytime you put a Right subs do pay for the membership, they would buy, like, you know, the state of Indiana as far as getting GCs.
**Mmoro**: But you do have the ability to add your subs to the director or to your kind of internal directory.
**Mmoro**: One benefit of that is it makes it so they never have to pay for your projects.
**Mcalcetero**: Gotcha.
**Mmoro**: Right.
**Mmoro**: It doesn't really make any sense.
**Mmoro**: Since you already have their contact info, you could just email them.
**Mmoro**: So.
**Mcalcetero**: Gotcha.
**Mcalcetero**: So you were.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, so you were saying there's a free version of this and the difference with the paid one.
**Mcalcetero**: Which.
**Mcalcetero**: What is the difference?
**Mcalcetero**: What are the difference?
**Mcalcetero**: The main ones.
**Mmoro**: Okay, so with the.
**Mmoro**: The best way to explain it is kind of with the limitations of the free one.
**Mmoro**: So a free one, you can post projects anywhere in the country.
**Mmoro**: It'll, you know, take the trades and locations and send out the invites to really the same subs that would.
**Mmoro**: But the paid one difference is with the free one, posting a project is really the only way to get to them.
**Mmoro**: Right.
**Mmoro**: You won't have the ability to look them up in this directory, so you can't contact them directly.
**Mmoro**: And then also you kind of have to wait until they view your project.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay.
**Mmoro**: Before you can reach out to them.
**Mmoro**: Yeah.
**Mmoro**: The Pro version pretty much eliminates those limitations.
**Mmoro**: Right.
**Mmoro**: You have access to the directory and then you have access to every sub you invited.
**Mmoro**: Those are the two key differences.
**Mmoro**: There's some other bells and whistles to go with it.
**Mmoro**: And then the version above that includes the lead section that I showed you and any other states you want to add there.
**Mcalcetero**: Gotcha.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay.
**Mcalcetero**: And then.
**Mcalcetero**: So here is just a communication between the SOPs and the projects and Then from there we'll just, you know, work on paper documents by, you know, between the SOP in the company.
**Mcalcetero**: Correct, Correct.
**Mmoro**: This is the Active.
**Mmoro**: So this is kind of the after, after you post it, activity and status tracking.
**Mmoro**: It'll default to the ones that have viewed it.
**Mmoro**: And then you can then narrow that down however you want and either message them through Plan Hub or break them down or, you know, you'll have their contact info here.
**Mmoro**: Obviously, one thing that I tell people to do a lot, this is only available with the paid one, but.
**Mmoro**: Right, but the paid one, you had this option where you can send it to every sub that received the invite.
**Mmoro**: I tell people send them a lot of those messages, even if it's a simple, you know.
**Mmoro**: Have you had a chance to look at this project yet?
**Mmoro**: Because every time you do it, 50 new subs that didn't do it already will go in there and view it.
**Mcalcetero**: Gotcha.
**Mmoro**: Free one.
**Mmoro**: Honestly, that's probably the biggest advantage of the upgrade.
**Mmoro**: Free one, you're kind of limited to this one.
**Mmoro**: They have to have viewed your project first to get any kind of updates from you.
**Mmoro**: Yeah.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay.
**Mcalcetero**: And then I see that you have something that is called the bits and the documents.
**Mcalcetero**: All the documents and the bits there is just what the.
**Mcalcetero**: So document.
**Mcalcetero**: Oh, gotcha.
**Mmoro**: This is what you uploaded in the.
**Mmoro**: In the project when you sent it out.
**Mcalcetero**: Oh, okay.
**Mcalcetero**: Makes sense.
**Mcalcetero**: Got it.
**Mmoro**: Yeah.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay.
**Mcalcetero**: So, okay.
**Mcalcetero**: And then price wise, how much are we talking?
**Mmoro**: With the paid version, the base price for just the pro one that doesn't have any leads is 3,000 a year.
**Mmoro**: Okay, I'll throw it in there.
**Mmoro**: We do have a Memorial Day promo running through Friday for 30% off.
**Mmoro**: So that brings it to 2100.
**Mmoro**: And then the one above that is the premiere, which is 4,000 a year.
**Mmoro**: Now, the only thing that could get that premiere kind of pricey is if y' all wanted the lead finder and, you know, beyond Indiana, because with the leads, Right, it doesn't matter where it is.
**Mmoro**: With the subs, it doesn't matter where it is.
**Mmoro**: Like, when you buy that Pro version, you have access to the subs nationwide.
**Mmoro**: There's no kind of geographical restriction, but with the leads, it's done by region.
**Mmoro**: Most regions are states.
**Mmoro**: So.
**Mmoro**: Okay, just to give you an example, there's that promo.
**Mmoro**: Here's this Premiere one.
**Mcalcetero**: Do you guys have a mobile version of this or it's just a desktop one?
**Mmoro**: No, there's an app, too.
**Mcalcetero**: There's an app, okay.
**Mmoro**: Yes, ma' am.
**Mmoro**: Right.
**Mmoro**: So Indiana will be Your lead region and would be included.
**Mmoro**: And the price would be 4,000 a year as you add states to it.
**Mcalcetero**: Right.
**Mmoro**: The first ones, the first one's 1249, the second one 749.
**Mmoro**: The third one's 600 and then they kind of stay at 600.
**Mcalcetero**: Gotcha.
**Mmoro**: Most.
**Mmoro**: Most lead regions are states like Florida and stuff is split up.
**Mmoro**: Texas is too, just because there's so many of them.
**Mmoro**: But yeah, and if y' all were really interested in like a nationwide package, we would put that together.
**Mmoro**: It would be less than adding them all up individually.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, because I was thinking we do actually have, you know, a lot of projects nationwide, so, you know, adding them one by one, it will be obviously even more expensive.
**Mmoro**: I think it works out to like 58, 000 a year if you do them individually.
**Mmoro**: Average price for the nationwide is more around 20.
**Mcalcetero**: 20,000.
**Mcalcetero**: Gotcha.
**Mmoro**: Yeah.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay, perfect.
**Mcalcetero**: So, well, you know, procure and you just mentioned, you know, like how good prokor is when people already talk to not finding people.
**Mcalcetero**: So how many people actually use PlanHub, like in general, like.
**Mcalcetero**: Like companies like us?
**Mmoro**: Well, there's three.
**Mmoro**: Oh.
**Mmoro**: There's 3,000 GCs every month to post projects with us.
**Mcalcetero**: Wow.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay.
**Mmoro**: Subs you saw, it's around the 350,000 active user mark.
**Mmoro**: Yeah, we're doing okay.
**Mmoro**: A lot of people use us, you know, in variety of ways.
**Mmoro**: Like some just use us as kind of what, you know, as like a procore farming system, which is fine.
**Mmoro**: Right.
**Mmoro**: They post projects, trying to just connect with new subs and then they eventually take them, vet them and put them into their procore system.
**Mmoro**: Or it really does have the capability to replace procore completely from a pre construction standpoint.
**Mmoro**: It doesn't do any project management stuff.
**Mcalcetero**: Gotcha.
**Mmoro**: So yeah.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay.
**Mcalcetero**: Stephen, is there a free trial that we can use with this?
**Mcalcetero**: I want Brandon and the team to take a look to these and you know, they are actually the ones who are finding the SOPs and everything.
**Mcalcetero**: So is it a free trial that we can have?
**Mcalcetero**: Should we go with the free version?
**Mmoro**: There's the free version as far as the finding subcontractor piece.
**Mmoro**: That'll give you a great idea of what kind of response you're going to get.
**Mmoro**: Generally it's at least twice the response.
**Mmoro**: So if you get right 20 bids, you can roughly count on 40 for the.
**Mmoro**: For the Premiere or the Pro one.
**Mcalcetero**: Gotcha.
**Mmoro**: The least.
**Mmoro**: There really is no trial, you know, just because it's protected data and it's, you know, long term.
**Mmoro**: Solution and that kind of.
**Mcalcetero**: Got it.
**Mmoro**: But we can.
**Mmoro**: Yeah, makes sense across that bridge when we get there.
**Mmoro**: Yeah.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay.
**Mcalcetero**: No, this is awesome.
**Mcalcetero**: Let me just.
**Mcalcetero**: I want the team to, you know, be able to play with it and feel comfortable.
**Mcalcetero**: And obviously they are the ones who are every day using Job Planner and Pro Kernel.
**Mcalcetero**: So I'm gonna.
**Mcalcetero**: I'm going to find.
**Mcalcetero**: I have here your page, actually.
**Mcalcetero**: So I'm just gonna go and send them this to try the free version.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay.
**Mcalcetero**: And then I'll just share this.
**Mmoro**: Would you like me to send you an email?
**Mmoro**: You can kind of forward along.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, if you can send me.
**Mcalcetero**: Can you actually give me an email with a summary of, you know, I know exactly what you guys are, but the differences between the, you know, pay version and the free version.
**Mcalcetero**: So I can share also with random.
**Mcalcetero**: And while the team are playing with it, we can actually come up if it's a right solution for us or if it can be a, you know, tool to replace with another tool.
**Mmoro**: Right.
**Mmoro**: Yeah.
**Mmoro**: And let me know if they would like a quick Zoom demo like this.
**Mmoro**: Happy to do any, you know, a group thing.
**Mcalcetero**: Yes, of course.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, I have your email, so that's good.
**Mcalcetero**: I think I received your email from.
**Mcalcetero**: One second.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, I have it here.
**Mcalcetero**: So I'll just reach out to you if anything.
**Mcalcetero**: But just let us.
**Mcalcetero**: Let me.
**Mcalcetero**: Give me some time just for the team so we can have time to play.
**Mmoro**: Absolutely.
