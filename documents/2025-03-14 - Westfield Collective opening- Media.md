**Calbright**: Okay, so who accepted this one?
**Calbright**: So one second.
**Calbright**: Hi, guys.
**Calbright**: Hi, Courtney.
**Calbright**: Hi.
**5connerkids**: How's it going?
**Calbright**: Good.
**Calbright**: Everything good?
**5connerkids**: Good.
**Calbright**: How are you?
**Calbright**: Everything good.
**Calbright**: So I think I'm waiting for Katie.
**Calbright**: Hi, Glenn.
**Calbright**: Hi, guys.
**Calbright**: So I just invited the guys from Alito.
**5connerkids**: I know.
**Calbright**: Yeah, yeah.
**Calbright**: Just to make sure if they have some ideas and everything, just to organize everything.
**Calbright**: I think we're just waiting for k.
**Calbright**: For Katie, so.
**Calbright**: One second.
**Calbright**: So she actually.
**Calbright**: Yes, you did accept it.
**Calbright**: Okay.
**Calbright**: We can move forward if you want.
**Calbright**: So we don't, you know, just like I want.
**Calbright**: We just have to.
**Calbright**: Let's just wait for two minutes just to see if she connects, and otherwise we'll just start.
**5connerkids**: No, that is.
**5connerkids**: That works for me.
**5connerkids**: How are you all doing today?
**Calbright**: Well, good.
**Calbright**: So I'm actually in Colombia and it's a very sunny but rainy, so.
**5connerkids**: Oh, nice.
**5connerkids**: Yeah, it's sunny here.
**5connerkids**: Thank goodness.
**5connerkids**: The weather is obviously not as great here, but still today is better.
**Calbright**: Good.
**Calbright**: And then, Glenn, you're in Indianapolis, right?
**Gducharme**: Yeah, we're in Indianapolis.
**Calbright**: Oh, okay, good.
**Calbright**: And then.
**Calbright**: Perfect.
**Calbright**: Let's see.
**Gducharme**: Do you come out here, Maria, to Indianapolis?
**Calbright**: No, I haven't.
**Calbright**: So I used.
**Calbright**: So I've been in Minnesota for three years, actually, doing my master's degree, and then in San Francisco, but never in Indianapolis.
**Calbright**: I had to go.
**5connerkids**: Yeah, we.
**5connerkids**: I mean, it's.
**5connerkids**: It's nice.
**5connerkids**: I mean, it's growing like crazy.
**5connerkids**: So I would usually not be like, you know, it's like a really fun place always to go.
**5connerkids**: Like all the exciting, you know, beaches and stuff that we have.
**5connerkids**: Yeah.
**5connerkids**: Just kidding.
**Calbright**: Okay, so let's just go ahead and just keep talking about this.
**Calbright**: Anyway, I just let Katie know.
**Calbright**: Okay.
**Calbright**: So, Courtney, first of all, thank you for joining.
**Calbright**: So what we want to do is just to have, like.
**Calbright**: I know Brandon and the team wants to have the chamber of commerce connected there.
**Calbright**: Once the happening is opening.
**Calbright**: The opening is the grand opening.
**Calbright**: This is going to be April for.
**Calbright**: Right, Glenn, at 11:00am so probably it's gonna be around one hour, one hour and a half.
**Calbright**: So how can we coordinate?
**Calbright**: You were telling us, or I think Katie told us that the mayor won't be able to join.
**Calbright**: But how can you know who can join?
**Calbright**: How do we can in contact with the local news and everything to just invite people?
**Calbright**: So how can we do that?
**5connerkids**: So.
**5connerkids**: Yes.
**5connerkids**: So right.
**5connerkids**: Correct.
**5connerkids**: Mayor will not be able to attend.
**5connerkids**: If he's not able to attend, we certainly try to get somebody on his behalf.
**5connerkids**: So whether it's chief of staff or it's another council member, typically I start with Danielle Kerry Tolan, who's chief of staff, or Patrick Tam, who's president of the council.
**Calbright**: Okay.
**5connerkids**: The other counselors are great, but, you know, I'm trying to get you like, you know, closer to mayor, if you will.
**5connerkids**: So what we do essentially is pretty standard.
**5connerkids**: We will invite all the council members, we invite our board of directors.
**5connerkids**: We're also the Downtown Westfield association, so we can include those directors as well.
**5connerkids**: And then we have like our media partners, all the city department heads.
**5connerkids**: So we are the ones that kind of just facilitate that to make it easier.
**5connerkids**: So just kind of all them and then they trickle it down to people who might be interested in attending.
**5connerkids**: As far as like formatting and stuff.
**5connerkids**: We're open to what you want to do.
**5connerkids**: Everybody has a different vision in mind, if you will.
**5connerkids**: And since it's a groundbreaking, I love that you already have your hard hat on because that's what we would ask if you can bring that we want to have, of course, the shovels and then the hard hats.
**5connerkids**: It always makes sense if it's yours because it's.
**5connerkids**: I mean, hello, it's branding.
**5connerkids**: So we also don't have them just laying around, but we do have extra shovels if needed.
**5connerkids**: But yeah, I say a few words typically mayor, so in this case it would be whoever's in his place and then whoever from the team wants to speak.
**5connerkids**: So.
**5connerkids**: And I'm just there to make sure that everybody's in the right place at the right time so that you don't have to do that.
**Calbright**: Okay.
**Calbright**: So Glenn in chat.
**Calbright**: Who's gonna talk?
**Calbright**: Brandon probably wanted to say something or you guys or what are you having mind for that?
**Calbright**: Because I know.
**Calbright**: Yeah, go ahead looking.
**Gducharme**: Katie is not on this invite.
**Calbright**: She was.
**Calbright**: She actually accepted it.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Calbright**: Yeah, she actually sent it on behalf of call somebody.
**Calbright**: Yeah, she shared with somebody.
**Calbright**: Yeah, instead of that one.
**Gducharme**: All right.
**Gducharme**: Sorry, I was just looking.
**Gducharme**: Usually it says not on that's okay.
**Calbright**: Or something, but I can actually give her later.
**Calbright**: You know, like we can always have a catch up after this.
**Calbright**: So.
**Calbright**: Yes, because I know you guys wanted like just, you know, probably random wants to talk and then do the grand opening and probably you guys want the ribbon and all the stuff and the cutting or.
**Calbright**: Right.
**Calbright**: And then probably from your side also from the chamber of.
**Calbright**: You know, we want to talk and everything.
**Calbright**: And then from my side, actually, I mean what I would like to help you guys with too is the journalist type of part.
**Calbright**: You know, if you already have like the local news corny that you can Connect me with or I don't know if you have something in mind.
**Calbright**: I can try to find it on my own.
**Calbright**: But just to have that at least, I don't know, maybe one local news to go there and just talk about it.
**5connerkids**: That's from yet we already include on that invite.
**5connerkids**: We include Current and Westfield.
**5connerkids**: We try to stick local.
**5connerkids**: Certainly there's other media partners that can come out, but we just find that those local ones are really going to be more.
**5connerkids**: More reliable because I mean other things pop up.
**5connerkids**: So we have Current in Westfield.
**5connerkids**: We have Westfield magazine.
**5connerkids**: He's also Town Post.
**5connerkids**: So Carmel, Noblesville, all those other surrounding areas.
**5connerkids**: He's actually on my board of director.
**5connerkids**: His name is Brandon Bolt.
**5connerkids**: So he has Westfield Magaz.
**5connerkids**: So he's on that.
**5connerkids**: And then we also have Hamilton county reporter.
**Calbright**: Oh, perfect.
**Calbright**: That's wonderful.
**Calbright**: So if everybody's gonna be in the invite.
**Calbright**: So okay.
**Calbright**: And then.
**Calbright**: So Glenn, you were asking Katie for what?
**Calbright**: Just sue for organization in terms of how you guys are going to organize, everybody going there or why.
**Gducharme**: I.
**Gducharme**: I thought Brandon and Katie were on this.
**Gducharme**: Were on this.
**Calbright**: No, no, no.
**Calbright**: Just as just Katie was in the meeting but she invited somebody on her behalf and Brandon.
**Calbright**: No, because we just need to coordinate everything and then I'll just let him know.
**Calbright**: So.
**5connerkids**: Yeah.
**5connerkids**: And I, to be fair, I talked to Katie already too.
**Calbright**: Oh, perfect.
**5connerkids**: Because we work with them.
**5connerkids**: They're a partner of ours.
**5connerkids**: And so we kind of talked about it and then she had made this introduction with Maria just to make sure that you guys are on the same page too.
**5connerkids**: So.
**Calbright**: Correct.
**5connerkids**: Yeah.
**Gducharme**: So for coordination for parking, we probably would want to coordinate.
**Gducharme**: Parking will be.
**Gducharme**: It'll be the fourth.
**Gducharme**: So we're.
**Gducharme**: We're going to start on the first and that's pushing dirt and basically kind of getting the pad set up so we can put our trailer and you know, equipment area.
**Gducharme**: But there won't be.
**Gducharme**: There will be a lot of parking on the site at that point.
**Gducharme**: We could grade out an area to have a dirt parking lot or something for the, for the day.
**Gducharme**: Maybe Chad.
**Gducharme**: Or we could.
**Gducharme**: We could.
**Gducharme**: How many, how many people would you expect to show up?
**5connerkids**: So from our end, because we'll also send that out to the membership as well.
**5connerkids**: I tell people give or take because things pop up.
**5connerkids**: But like give or take, you're probably going to say 20 on our end between councils or council members, board of directors.
**5connerkids**: Yeah, there's a lot of them.
**5connerkids**: So that's kind of where that is.
**5connerkids**: But like openings tend to get more obviously so I say just take 20 and add it to whomever you're inviting to between, you know, again, our invite, our calendar invite to all the council members and them, and then we blast out to the whole membership, which is a large number, but again, 20 is.
**Gducharme**: So to plan for 40 or so people, 30 vehicles.
**Gducharme**: And then whoever, you know, it's not the mayor, but whoever the vip, you know, people, if you will, make sure we have a parking, you know, on site for them.
**Gducharme**: What do you think, Chad, about having.
**Gducharme**: Having a part, a port part of that?
**Gducharme**: We'll have all that.
**Gducharme**: The existing parking lot would be.
**Gducharme**: Honestly, it'd be fine.
**Ctragesser**: Well, it'll probably be scraped by then.
**Gducharme**: But we can make it to make our path.
**Ctragesser**: We'll make, we'll make temporary parking site.
**Gducharme**: Yes.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Ctragesser**: Yeah, we'll have temporary parking with the stones.
**Ctragesser**: So that way everybody has easy access.
**5connerkids**: Yeah, well, and the good news is, is like I was like trying to see if I could like see from above, like what it, what it looks like because I'm over there.
**5connerkids**: But like where exactly it's at because people are used to it for these groundbreakings.
**5connerkids**: Like we're just like wherever we can go.
**5connerkids**: So they're used to that also too.
**5connerkids**: You know, obviously our partnership with the city and then the police officers.
**5connerkids**: So like we technically can get away with parking on like a side of a road if we need to.
**5connerkids**: But yes, ideally we have something outside that.
**Gducharme**: So here's the location here.
**5connerkids**: Okay, perfect.
**Gducharme**: The new YMCA in green.
**Gducharme**: Yep, yep.
**Gducharme**: So we have a house next to us and then this is the existing lot that will, that we'll work with here.
**5connerkids**: Yeah, so I see.
**5connerkids**: Yeah.
**5connerkids**: Because the Grand Park Boulevard, obviously that's going to be.
**5connerkids**: That's a, that's busy, busy.
**5connerkids**: But.
**Gducharme**: So there is an entrance.
**Gducharme**: You know, there's not an accelerate sell lane or return lane or anything yet.
**Gducharme**: We will be putting that in part of this.
**Gducharme**: But for now I guess what we'll do is we'll.
**Gducharme**: This is on Friday.
**Gducharme**: On Thursday we're getting our trailers and stuff set up and that is going to be down in the southeast corner.
**Gducharme**: So yeah, Chad will take some of this, build our pad and then we'll leave enough parking here for.
**Gducharme**: And if there's overflow, then they can come over to the parking here.
**Gducharme**: Honestly, they can park off, off to the side here in this dirt also.
**5connerkids**: Perfect.
**5connerkids**: Yep, that's great.
**Gducharme**: But yeah, we'll, we'll leave this open and then we'll have a graded up area for us to build a little dirt.
**Gducharme**: Box.
**5connerkids**: Well, and again, too.
**5connerkids**: It's great because we'll just include that in the invite for people to, like, you know, any little, like, tidbits like that, just so that they know to dress accordingly is really the big thing.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, I'll.
**Gducharme**: Let me do.
**Gducharme**: I'll take a screenshot of this, and I'll send a markup to us so you can send to people.
**Gducharme**: So they.
**5connerkids**: That'll be great.
**5connerkids**: That'll be great.
**5connerkids**: So, yeah.
**5connerkids**: And then, I mean, again, everything else is kind of really on what you.
**5connerkids**: What you want to do.
**5connerkids**: Some people.
**5connerkids**: I was, like, trying to think of the date.
**5connerkids**: Like, some people want to do tens in case the weather's bad.
**5connerkids**: Like, we just, you know, because some people do actually just cancel it, but I'm assuming you don't want to do that, so just kind of thinking about those things.
**5connerkids**: If you want to talk outside.
**5connerkids**: What we do, we try to keep it short and sweet, but again, it's.
**5connerkids**: It's your event, so we're just there to help facilitate it.
**5connerkids**: Just know if it's gonna be a long time, then some people do chairs and tent.
**5connerkids**: But also, you don't need to go crazy if you don't want to.
**5connerkids**: Snacks and whatever.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Gducharme**: For 40.
**Gducharme**: For 40 people.
**Gducharme**: And I know that the owners are schmoozers, so there you go.
**5connerkids**: Yeah, no, listen, that's great.
**Gducharme**: I didn't even think of that.
**5connerkids**: Yeah, no, yeah.
**5connerkids**: Ten, like.
**5connerkids**: And we're doing Sun King today at four.
**5connerkids**: And honestly, they.
**5connerkids**: I think, well, they got rid of the tent because it's, like, on Jersey Street.
**5connerkids**: It's, like, very windy where it's at, so they're not even do it.
**5connerkids**: And it's looking good so far.
**5connerkids**: Knock on wood.
**5connerkids**: But.
**5connerkids**: And we have, like, a speaker system that we can bring.
**5connerkids**: I just need to pull power from somewhere.
**Gducharme**: We will have power set up by Friday.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**5connerkids**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: Close.
**Gducharme**: Close to that.
**Ctragesser**: Right, Right.
**Gducharme**: Actually right out that area.
**Gducharme**: Our trailer.
**Gducharme**: We'll do it.
**Gducharme**: We'll do it close to our trailer.
**Gducharme**: That's where the gravel and stuff will be.
**5connerkids**: So do you definitely want us to bring that speaker system, then?
**Gducharme**: Say again?
**5connerkids**: Do you want me to bring that speaker system then, so you don't have to worry about that?
**Gducharme**: I mean, I'm not gonna.
**Gducharme**: I'm gonna say no to free work.
**Gducharme**: Bring it on.
**5connerkids**: One last thing for you.
**5connerkids**: I'm like, great.
**5connerkids**: Yeah.
**5connerkids**: Listen, I should probably try to encourage people.
**5connerkids**: I don't know.
**5connerkids**: It's.
**5connerkids**: It's not like this massive thing, but it also is too, so it does the trick, we're always, like, lugging out, but no, it works.
**5connerkids**: So we can bring it.
**Gducharme**: The ones up on stands or something.
**5connerkids**: Well, so I was trying to think, can we.
**5connerkids**: We.
**5connerkids**: The stands.
**5connerkids**: I don't think we've used the last two.
**Gducharme**: And.
**5connerkids**: Sorry, we're.
**5connerkids**: We're in the same office.
**5connerkids**: It's a very tiny office, but I don't think this.
**5connerkids**: The stands are somewhere.
**5connerkids**: So we just put them on the ground.
**Gducharme**: Just on the ground.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, that's fine.
**5connerkids**: Yeah.
**Gducharme**: All right.
**Gducharme**: What are you.
**Gducharme**: I heard you're bringing the tent and snacks, too.
**5connerkids**: We'll bring the change that I.
**5connerkids**: You know what?
**5connerkids**: I think you missed misheard that.
**5connerkids**: No, what I can do for you is I can set you up with people who we work with who are awesome.
**5connerkids**: That's.
**5connerkids**: That's typically like, we.
**5connerkids**: We work with Becky the Baxter a lot here in town.
**5connerkids**: Like, we like to support local as much as we can, but certainly go whichever route.
**5connerkids**: But she is like this new stamping machine that I'm obsessed with, so you can, like, put logos on it and stuff.
**5connerkids**: Cookies.
**5connerkids**: So that's always a neat one and it's affordable.
**5connerkids**: Just tell her Courtney sent you and she'll give you the discount.
**Gducharme**: What does she do?
**Gducharme**: Is she an event coordinator?
**Gducharme**: Is she a.
**5connerkids**: No, she.
**5connerkids**: It's.
**5connerkids**: She's Becky the baker, so she owns a bakery here in downtown Wesfield.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Calbright**: Oh, that's nice.
**Calbright**: Yeah.
**Calbright**: If you can introduce this Courtney.
**Calbright**: So we can actually.
**Calbright**: Just give us an email or everything to introduce me and then I just connect with everybody so we have everything.
**Calbright**: Everybody in the same place.
**Calbright**: So that'll be great.
**Calbright**: Yeah.
**5connerkids**: When you send the markup, I'll.
**5connerkids**: I'll just send her number.
**5connerkids**: Truly.
**5connerkids**: That's it.
**5connerkids**: Just again, say Courtney from the chamber sent me and she'll.
**5connerkids**: She'll do it.
**Calbright**: She can.
**5connerkids**: I just.
**5connerkids**: She's so great.
**5connerkids**: We've worked with her for years.
**5connerkids**: But, yeah, like, those are some great ideas.
**5connerkids**: Some people do, like, champagne, some people just do water.
**5connerkids**: Like, again, totally up to you.
**Calbright**: Yeah, just.
**Calbright**: Just give us the options and then we can actually, you know, everything I can after this.
**Calbright**: I will just give it a little brief to Brandon in case.
**Calbright**: If he wants to add something.
**Calbright**: But I know the guys here going and shouted, you know, the person in charge, so that's good.
**Calbright**: And then, yeah, so once that send out, please send that to us.
**Calbright**: And also copying Katie, because I noticed that she actually accepted the meeting, but she couldn' Join, so.
**Calbright**: So she's also on, you know, on the.
**Calbright**: On the invite, on the Loop.
**5connerkids**: Yep.
**5connerkids**: Great.
**5connerkids**: That for sure.
**5connerkids**: And then again, just the, the big thing is again, just letting me know as we get closer who, who's speaking.
**5connerkids**: So I know who I have to introduce.
**5connerkids**: But sometimes then I'll introduce somebody and then it just goes down the line and they can, you know, just knowing those speakers and then how many shovels and hard hats that you want?
**5connerkids**: So traditionally I do like key staff members.
**5connerkids**: Like we have, you know.
**5connerkids**: Well, again, not mayor in this case, but like whoever's in mayor's position and just a couple people.
**5connerkids**: If we have too many people, then we'll just like circulate them out and just get as many as we can.
**5connerkids**: So thinking about that number is again, just helpful for how many shovels and how many hard hats we need.
**Gducharme**: I would say eight.
**5connerkids**: That's pretty standard.
**5connerkids**: Yep.
**5connerkids**: Eight to ten.
**5connerkids**: It's pretty safe.
**Gducharme**: We have hard hats here.
**5connerkids**: Okay, that's great.
**Gducharme**: We should have some extra ones here.
**Gducharme**: You guys have the shovels, though?
**5connerkids**: So we do not.
**5connerkids**: We only have six shovels because we really were not going to do it.
**5connerkids**: And a lot of most times that whoever is working on the project has shovels.
**5connerkids**: But I have six if you need to supplement.
**5connerkids**: Whatever.
**Gducharme**: I'm just curious what you.
**Gducharme**: Because that was on your list, but you're just, you're just.
**Ctragesser**: Glenn, you may want to get with A.J.
**Ctragesser**: glenn, I think we have shovels in the either storage unit or job trailer from Creative State.
**Gducharme**: My question was, Courtney, are you just going through kind of a checklist of things that we should.
**Gducharme**: That we.
**5connerkids**: Yeah.
**Gducharme**: Not stuff that you're providing.
**5connerkids**: Yeah, stuff that.
**5connerkids**: Well, stuff that you like.
**5connerkids**: What we need from you is again, speaker names.
**5connerkids**: Yes.
**5connerkids**: Hard hats, shovels.
**Calbright**: Yeah.
**5connerkids**: I always just tell you too, this is what we have.
**5connerkids**: Should you need extras.
**5connerkids**: Yeah, I'm trying to think.
**5connerkids**: What else.
**Gducharme**: Do you have a.
**Gducharme**: Have a good event coordinating company that could do either.
**Gducharme**: At least come set up the tent and then come back and do the tear down.
**5connerkids**: Yes, I, I, and I could put that.
**5connerkids**: I use a classic party rental.
**Gducharme**: A classic.
**5connerkids**: A classic party rental.
**5connerkids**: Yep.
**5connerkids**: They do a lot of our events, so, yeah, they're great.
**5connerkids**: And if you needed like again, 10 or something, I don't know.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, I think that's who I used last time at the, my last groundbreaking.
**Gducharme**: Somebody like that.
**Gducharme**: They came in a truck, they set up their tents, the poles, the tents.
**Gducharme**: And I don't know if they did all the snacks or we just went to Costco or something like that.
**5connerkids**: But Costco is always a great option, frankly, because Again, I tell people you spend what you want to spend, but like it's not going to be this huge crowd unless you're bringing in this huge crowd.
**5connerkids**: It's, you know, kind of that select group that we have.
**5connerkids**: And I just don't want you to waste your money unless you really want to.
**Gducharme**: Plastic party rental.
**Gducharme**: They're not there.
**Gducharme**: They would not do it.
**Gducharme**: They did not do any food or anything like that.
**Gducharme**: They're just the.
**Gducharme**: No equipment.
**5connerkids**: That would be great.
**5connerkids**: I could like one stop shop with that.
**Gducharme**: No, that'd be cool.
**Gducharme**: Local bakery.
**Gducharme**: That's a good idea for.
**5connerkids**: Yeah, well, and again, because I love.
**5connerkids**: Because she'll just put your logos on it too.
**5connerkids**: And that's just really.
**5connerkids**: It's.
**5connerkids**: It's a nice touch for sure.
**5connerkids**: And then the only other thing, Maria, you mentioned the ribbon.
**5connerkids**: So we actually don't bring ribbons to the groundbreaking solely because that will do a ribbon cutting ceremony once the grand opening happens.
**5connerkids**: So really all we do here is just turn dirt and take a picture.
**Calbright**: Okay.
**5connerkids**: So unless you want to.
**5connerkids**: But yeah, yeah, I don't know.
**Calbright**: I mean we did it with one project, so that's.
**Calbright**: I mean we can actually ask if you guys want it.
**Calbright**: Like crazy.
**Calbright**: I know we did it with one project, so it was a brief on cutting and everything.
**Calbright**: But it's up to you guys also, what do you want for that?
**Calbright**: So we can get back to you on that in case they want it.
**5connerkids**: Yeah, if you want it, let me know.
**5connerkids**: But I again, traditionally it's done that way because it's like, yay, let's cut the ribbon and walk inside.
**5connerkids**: But yeah, I'll defer to you guys.
**5connerkids**: We have enough ribbon.
**5connerkids**: We do enough of these, so if you need it, just let me know.
**Calbright**: Sounds good.
**5connerkids**: Good.
**Calbright**: Okay.
**Calbright**: Something else that you guys think we need.
**Calbright**: I just, I was just calling Katie just to see and she's not available.
**Calbright**: So everything that all the items we can just, you know, send them on an email and just make sure everybody's on the loop.
**Calbright**: So yeah, I mean that was actually it.
**Calbright**: And then.
**Calbright**: Yeah, Courtney, just if you can give us also the emails, you know, from the people from the.
**Calbright**: The local restaurant with the cookies, that would be great.
**Calbright**: So we can maybe head it as an option and then from the magazine and everybody who is copy there will be awesome to have it there as well.
**5connerkids**: Yeah, they're.
**5connerkids**: They go out on our invite, but yeah, if you need them.
**5connerkids**: But we'll just already be inviting them again.
**5connerkids**: So.
**5connerkids**: Yeah.
**Calbright**: When are you going to send these invites, Courtney?
**5connerkids**: So Once we actually.
**5connerkids**: Let me just look at my calendar, I'm like, did we even already.
**5connerkids**: Typically we send out that hold on calendars as soon as I hear back from the city.
**5connerkids**: Okay, what was it like?
**5connerkids**: What was the date here?
**5connerkids**: No, we'll.
**5connerkids**: We'll need to add that, but we'll.
**5connerkids**: We'll get that taken care of.
**5connerkids**: So.
**5connerkids**: Yeah, we'll put a hold.
**5connerkids**: Do we.
**5connerkids**: Never mind.
**5connerkids**: Haley said we sent it yesterday.
**Calbright**: Oh, good.
**Calbright**: Awesome.
**Calbright**: That's wonderful.
**5connerkids**: So great.
**Calbright**: Okay, see, this is great.
**Calbright**: So if you receive like some responsive accepting and everything, just let us know.
**Calbright**: So we are actually knowing who is actually going from the invites.
**5connerkids**: So we'll 100% do that.
**5connerkids**: I'm just fully transparent people, especially with council members and things like that.
**5connerkids**: I send it, they accept, and I almost just take it with a grain of salt and still stick with that 20 number because.
**5connerkids**: Okay, who accepts and who comes or who declines and who comes is never.
**5connerkids**: They never match.
**Calbright**: Gotcha.
**Calbright**: Okay.
**5connerkids**: So I would love to be say that it's reliable.
**5connerkids**: We're actually currently as a team working on how we can do that.
**5connerkids**: But again, I get that people have busy schedules, so it's.
**5connerkids**: It's a great thing.
**5connerkids**: It's fine.
**5connerkids**: But it's more of like if something pops up, they.
**Calbright**: Okay, that's good.
**Calbright**: Something else.
**Calbright**: Glenn or Shadow.
**Calbright**: You think it's important for that data we need to coordinate with Kearney before we just move forward with everything.
**Gducharme**: No, yeah, we're ready.
**Gducharme**: I mean, we're ready to move forward.
**Gducharme**: I'll.
**Gducharme**: I'll.
**Gducharme**: We'll get this a rough mock up of where.
**Gducharme**: Where everything's going to go on this blow up that I sent.
**Gducharme**: I'll email that out here in a little bit.
**Calbright**: Yes, thank you.
**Calbright**: And then let's talk to Brandon if he wants to speak or if you want to talk or who can be the speaker.
**Calbright**: You know, we can ask him.
**Gducharme**: You're coordinating all this, Maria, I think we'll just bring a project.
**Calbright**: I think I can pick you in chat.
**Gducharme**: You can.
**Calbright**: Brandon always speaks, which is okay.
**Calbright**: But if you guys want to do it, you know, the actual will be great too.
**5connerkids**: Yeah, again.
**5connerkids**: And I.
**5connerkids**: I can know the day of.
**5connerkids**: Truly, it doesn't matter.
**5connerkids**: I just don't want to butcher names, so.
**5connerkids**: And we show up early just to make sure there's nothing we can assist with.
**5connerkids**: But.
**5connerkids**: Yeah, I just don't want to like.
**5connerkids**: Yeah.
**5connerkids**: And you come on up and speak.
**Calbright**: Well, you can tell them.
**Calbright**: Just force them, Courtney.
**Calbright**: You know they're mad.
**Calbright**: You can for them, right?
**Calbright**: Glenn, come here and talk.
**Gducharme**: Great speakers come with a microphone, right?
**5connerkids**: Yes.
**Gducharme**: It's not just for music before and after.
**5connerkids**: I wish, you know, we've done music before.
**5connerkids**: It's not the greatest, but.
**5connerkids**: Yeah, yeah, this thing has seen its days.
**5connerkids**: But.
**5connerkids**: But that's why we're out in dirt with it.
**5connerkids**: So, you know, but yeah, well.
**5connerkids**: And you guys have my information, so if there are any other questions.
**5connerkids**: But again, on our end, we.
**5connerkids**: We try to make it as easy as possible.
**5connerkids**: That's why we have a structure and we're happy to go outside of it, but it just, like, makes sense because then we.
**5connerkids**: You don't have to worry about who's where at what time.
**5connerkids**: If we get those tents there, we get the parking ready, we'll try to bring the people to show up and be there.
**Calbright**: Awesome.
**Calbright**: That's awesome.
**Calbright**: Yeah.
**Calbright**: And our team is going as well, so that's good.
**Calbright**: Okay, perfect.
**Calbright**: So just waiting for Glenn to send the email, and then after that, we're just gonna have it from there.
**Calbright**: And it's just looping everybody, Glenn.
**Calbright**: So everybody is on the same page.
**Calbright**: Also, if you want to look, Brandon, I'll just talk to him on the phone and ask him if he wants to.
**Calbright**: I will prefer you guys, but I'll just ask him if he wants to talk, and then other than that, we'll keep you on the loop.
**Calbright**: And thank you, Courtney, for this.
**Calbright**: I'll just try to call Katie later and just let her know if she needs anything.
**Calbright**: Maybe I can, you know, maybe she can jump on the email as well and just write anything.
**5connerkids**: Okay.
**Calbright**: But thank you so much for your help, and thank you guys for joining in for your ideas.
**Calbright**: All right, ready for the day?
**Calbright**: Thank you.
**5connerkids**: Yes, us too.
**5connerkids**: Us too.
**5connerkids**: Thank you, guys.
**5connerkids**: Bye.
**Calbright**: Okay, bye.
