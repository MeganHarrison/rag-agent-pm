## Transcript
**Jdawson**: Jesse?
**Jdawson**: Jesse, are you there?
**Jdawson**: You're muted if you are.
**Emilydudley**: Hey, Stacy, can you hear me?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Jesse, can you hear us?
**Emilydudley**: I can.
**Jdawson**: Perfect.
**Emilydudley**: Well, I'm driving in a truck, so it might be a little loud, but here.
**Jdawson**: Alrighty, no worries.
**Jdawson**: Well, then we can just turn our cameras off then, since you're driving while.
**Jdawson**: Well, thanks for taking the time to chat with me today.
**Jdawson**: I have my manager, Emily, here on the call as well.
**Jdawson**: But how's your week been going?
**Emilydudley**: Busy and very busy.
**Jdawson**: Busy.
**Jdawson**: I can appreciate that.
**Jdawson**: I really, really appreciate, you know, taking the time and, you know, having Glenn, you know, shoot over that info, that intro for me.
**Jdawson**: So appreciate that from Glenn.
**Jdawson**: Any fun plans coming up this weekend?
**Emilydudley**: Just work.
**Emilydudley**: All we did, though, is work.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: Feel that for sure.
**Jdawson**: What projects are you guys working on right now?
**Emilydudley**: I don't know.
**Emilydudley**: They're all over the place.
**Emilydudley**: I mean, I couldn't list them all off the top of my head, but, you know, we just.
**Emilydudley**: We got projects in every phase of estimating to middle of them to getting ready to start, so.
**Jdawson**: Yep, for sure.
**Jdawson**: I feel that that's what we're hearing all the time in construction.
**Jdawson**: Everyone's building right now, especially in Indy.
**Jdawson**: Well, want to say thank you again for taking the time to chat with me.
**Jdawson**: What I want to do today is, you know, learn a little more about Alito, more than what's just on your website, kind of go through what you guys are currently doing for recru and share with you how I can be a resource and possibly, you know, help fill the roles that Glenn had mentioned.
**Jdawson**: How does that sound to you?
**Cgoodin**: Good.
**Emilydudley**: And I would just like to, you know, I've had a lot of discussions with Brandon, and we spent time yesterday talking about it just because of the frustration level of, you know, we tried to use five different recruiting firms.
**Emilydudley**: Some recruiting firms he paid up front, and we've not made one hire from any of that.
**Emilydudley**: And we're getting like, the ones that do send them, they're like sending either unqualified or like, just.
**Emilydudley**: It's not been a good experience.
**Emilydudley**: So what I would like to do is just, you know, as a.
**Emilydudley**: As the person that I have to review all these resumes and make the hire for the person.
**Emilydudley**: If we could find someone that could actually find what we're looking for, number one, and, you know, not waste our time or your time by sending us, you know, we need a recruiter that, like, that's the person we're looking for and send us that.
**Emilydudley**: And then if you don't think you can find, you know, those people for us, then, you know, it's a waste of your time.
**Emilydudley**: So, you know, we're, we're not a giant company, but we were expanding quickly and our projects are expanding quickly as well.
**Emilydudley**: But you know, right now we're not looking for someone with, you know, 30 years of experience and has done giant projects because, you know, at this time, you know, I wouldn't want to scare them off if they come on board and be like, well, you know, here's a, yeah, two million dollar job and here's, you know, you know, 50 or $500,000 job.
**Emilydudley**: And then we're coming up, we got a 10 million dollar job.
**Emilydudley**: Like we're looking for that.
**Emilydudley**: Like a younger person, ideally six years or so of experience that wants to join a company that is expanding, that they can make a name for themselves.
**Emilydudley**: They work hard, they understand, you know, I don't want to have to teach someone day one how to do everything on there.
**Emilydudley**: So they need a certain knowledge of that.
**Emilydudley**: And you know, they, they're someone that's done commercial construction for a general contractor.
**Emilydudley**: You know, we're not, you know, that's the type person we're looking for.
**Emilydudley**: And yeah, we would hire that person tomorrow unless they were asking for $200,000.
**Cgoodin**: Salary, you know, or something.
**Emilydudley**: Just crazy ridiculous over what, you know, what their, what the rate is for.
**Emilydudley**: I would think a person like that, 110, 120 max for salary, you know, I don't know if that's out of the world these days or what.
**Emilydudley**: People are coming look for you for it.
**Emilydudley**: Like that's the people we want.
**Emilydudley**: Superintendents and PMs, you know, maybe super with more experience, depending on some of the larger work we have coming up for that.
**Emilydudley**: But, you know, that's what we're looking for and that's not what we're getting from anybody.
**Emilydudley**: And it seems like it's almost, it's why even bother with it, you know.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, of course.
**Emilydudley**: The results we want.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, of course.
**Jdawson**: I can, I can definitely understand, you know, the frustration with that just a little bit, you know, about Michael Page and my team.
**Jdawson**: I'm a team.
**Jdawson**: We're a part of a team of seven people.
**Jdawson**: We only recruit construction professionals in Indianapolis and they're only doing commercial construction ground up with a general contractor.
**Jdawson**: So, you know, hopefully that alleviates your concern with, you know, us not sending you, you know, qualified candidates and you know, having to go through that, going through this process with us, having me hear more about your company, what you guys are looking for specifically in each of the can.
**Jdawson**: In each of the roles really, you know, helps us tailor our.
**Jdawson**: Tailor your experience with us because we want to be a partner to you guys and we want to make sure that we're finding you qualified candidates.
**Jdawson**: So that's why we're taking this time today.
**Jdawson**: As you know, I was trying to work with Glenn.
**Jdawson**: Glenn is what was one of the candidates that I was, you know, pitching jobs to as well.
**Jdawson**: And you guys just nabbed him up right before I could get them.
**Jdawson**: But, yeah, that's just a perfect example of, like, I was working with a candidate that you guys did hire.
**Jdawson**: So I hope that shows that, you know, we can definitely prove ourselves within the market and hopefully, you know, find those qualified people for you.
**Jdawson**: And going off the salary as well, I definitely think that is market standard, that 110 to 120 right now, for sure.
**Jdawson**: And I can definitely send you our salary survey as well.
**Jdawson**: We take a talent trends kind of guide every year that shows the salaries that candidates have or what they're looking for and stuff like that.
**Jdawson**: So I can definitely shoot that over to you after this meeting as well, if you'd like.
**Emilydudley**: Okay, fine.
**Jdawson**: All right, perfect.
**Jdawson**: Well, just kind of really want to run through with you, you know, about you, about the company and what really sets you apart from your competitors and what your hiring process is.
**Jdawson**: And then I can, you know, go into the roles themselves because I know Glenn listed off like five, I believe.
**Jdawson**: And we can definitely walk through our contract as well on and going off of you saying that you've paid some recruiters up front.
**Jdawson**: We don't work that way.
**Jdawson**: We're not a retainer.
**Jdawson**: We are on contingent.
**Jdawson**: So you only pay us when you hire one of our candidates.
**Jdawson**: Perfect.
**Jdawson**: Well, how long have you been with Alita?
**Emilydudley**: A little over a year right around here.
**Emilydudley**: But I've known Brandon for 12 years probably, and we've been friends and just finally a good time for me to join.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: How.
**Jdawson**: How did you meet Brandon?
**Emilydudley**: We worked together.
**Emilydudley**: He was actually my assistant PM at the Angelus Diamond.
**Emilydudley**: It's a company down in Florida.
**Emilydudley**: And so he came on board and helped me a lot.
**Emilydudley**: It was really good and got to be friends from that.
**Jdawson**: Amazing.
**Jdawson**: What part.
**Jdawson**: Are you still living in Florida?
**Jdawson**: Are you in Indy now?
**Emilydudley**: Yeah, I live in Clearwater, Florida.
**Emilydudley**: We have an office down there, too.
**Jdawson**: Really?
**Jdawson**: I am actually originally from Orlando.
**Jdawson**: I spent 25 years down there.
**Jdawson**: I've got a good bit of friends in The Clearwater, Tampa, St.
**Jdawson**: Pete beach area.
**Emilydudley**: Yeah.
**Emilydudley**: I love it.
**Emilydudley**: I'm not moving to Indiana, I can tell you that.
**Jdawson**: I believe you.
**Jdawson**: This was my.
**Jdawson**: We're actually based out of Chicago, but I only recruit for Indianapolis construction professionals.
**Jdawson**: This is my first winter in Chicago and being a Floridian, I made up in my head it was going to be way worse than it was.
**Jdawson**: I'm kind of glad that I did that because it made it better.
**Jdawson**: But definitely, you know, I'm looking forward to getting back in the sun and getting some sand between my toes.
**Emilydudley**: Yeah, I don't know as bad this year.
**Emilydudley**: I come up to India every two weeks, basically, and it's freezing and I can't.
**Emilydudley**: I can't handle this weather.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I feel that.
**Jdawson**: I totally feel that.
**Jdawson**: And what are your responsibilities, you know, as vice president at Alito?
**Emilydudley**: I manage all of the people the company and hire people.
**Jdawson**: Okay, perfect.
**Jdawson**: And what is your guys like, average project size right now?
**Emilydudley**: I would say, I don't know, they probably average out to about 3 million.
**Jdawson**: Perfect.
**Jdawson**: What projects?
**Jdawson**: You know, I noticed on your website that you guys had done some high rises in Clearwater and some healthcare and industrial here in Indy.
**Jdawson**: What types of projects are you guys breaking into now?
**Emilydudley**: We're like have stuff coming up in Florida that is condos and hospitality places there.
**Emilydudley**: Indy, same thing.
**Emilydudley**: Building the Westfield Collective is a big indoor volleyball bars and restaurant facility.
**Emilydudley**: And we do a lot of projects for Goodwill, their, their charter schools and their retail centers.
**Jdawson**: Perfect.
**Emilydudley**: A lot of warehouse, warehouse work, you know, the big giant, but the robotic.
**Emilydudley**: I mean, that's why we need a fire sprinkler pm, because we do a lot of the fire sprinkler systems that integrate with all of the automated storage and racking systems.
**Jdawson**: Interesting.
**Jdawson**: I thought it's very niche.
**Jdawson**: It seems like, you know, buyers, buyer sprinklers, stuff like that.
**Emilydudley**: Yeah, just something that nobody really knows how to do it.
**Emilydudley**: And so Brandon's an expert on it and found a niche in that.
**Emilydudley**: So we do them all over the country.
**Jdawson**: All right, cool.
**Jdawson**: Well, I'll definitely make sure that, you know, when we're talking to candidates, let's see that.
**Emilydudley**: That is a person of all the other candidates.
**Emilydudley**: Yeah, GC experience.
**Emilydudley**: But if there's someone that works at a fire sprinkler company and like he's an expert in that field, like we can teach him the rest.
**Emilydudley**: As long as he's like a PM or you know, designer for fire sprinkler systems, someone that works for fire sprinkler company that would be a candidate for that position.
**Jdawson**: Okay, cool.
**Jdawson**: That's, that's great for me to know.
**Jdawson**: That's definitely something that we can, you know, tailor our search to and make sure that, you know, we're asking those candidates, you have this experience.
**Jdawson**: So that's really good.
**Jdawson**: That way I won't send you over candidates that don't.
**Jdawson**: And with that, what would you say your guys is like annual revenue is right now?
**Emilydudley**: Well, last year was like 12 May and this year I think we're going to push 20.
**Emilydudley**: The growth.
**Emilydudley**: I see no end to it as long as we could keep enough people on board.
**Emilydudley**: So Grant is out selling and we're building.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, of course.
**Jdawson**: I mean, that's, that's a huge jump.
**Jdawson**: And looks like the.
**Jdawson**: You guys have only been around since 2022, right?
**Emilydudley**: Yeah, three years.
**Jdawson**: Three years, yeah.
**Jdawson**: That's.
**Jdawson**: That, that's a good chunk of revenue for only being three years in the business.
**Jdawson**: How many people do you guys have over there.
**Emilydudley**: Total?
**Emilydudley**: Like 10 to 12.
**Jdawson**: That, that is a good chunk of revenue for only 10 to 12 people to be working on.
**Jdawson**: So definitely can understand, you know, the wanting to add, add on and bring on more people and really help you guys grow and continue to jump up over 20 million.
**Jdawson**: So that makes total sense to me.
**Jdawson**: And with those 10 to 20 people, I mean, 10 to 12 people, how many are project managers?
**Emilydudley**: We have basically four, six.
**Emilydudley**: You count me and Brandon because we still have to jump in and help with it.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, perfect.
**Jdawson**: And how many supers?
**Emilydudley**: Four superintendents and we got cows.
**Emilydudley**: Yeah, basically assistant.
**Emilydudley**: That helps us out with everything.
**Jdawson**: Okay, and are your supers?
**Jdawson**: I know you guys are nation national.
**Jdawson**: Do your supers travel nationwide for the projects?
**Emilydudley**: Two of them do.
**Jdawson**: Two of them travel.
**Jdawson**: Okay, perfect.
**Jdawson**: And I noticed that when Glenn was talking, Glenn sent that email, he mentioned pre con manager and estimator.
**Jdawson**: That's another role that you guys are looking to bring on as well.
**Emilydudley**: I hired a Pete, an estimator, but he doesn't start for a couple weeks.
**Emilydudley**: But I think we, we have one estimator coming up for him.
**Jdawson**: Okay, all right, good to know.
**Jdawson**: Well, what do you think really sets you guys apart from your competitors?
**Jdawson**: And who do you think your main competitors would.
**Emilydudley**: I don't know.
**Emilydudley**: I don't know that many GCs in Indiana just getting started in Florida, so I couldn't tell you that.
**Emilydudley**: But I can tell you as far as compensation and bonuses, like the bonus aspect of it, other companies talk about it and it actually phase out at the end of the year.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah, of course.
**Jdawson**: That's Definitely, you know, a great selling point.
**Jdawson**: And, you know, if I were, when I'm pitching Alito to candidates, how would you like me to sell you guys?
**Emilydudley**: We just want, like, people that are motivated, come someplace, you know, work hard and make a name for themselves and enjoy the growth of the company because it's going to grow.
**Emilydudley**: His goal is to be a billion dollar a year company, which is a gigantic thing, but that's, he's going to get there.
**Emilydudley**: And even if, like, you set your goal and you only hit 75% of it, that's still a big company.
**Emilydudley**: And so we're looking for the people that want to join something.
**Emilydudley**: And you know, you start with 10 people.
**Emilydudley**: When you get to 200 people, you're on the top 10.
**Emilydudley**: That started everything, made it grow.
**Emilydudley**: So that's what they have to be is, I know right off the bat, like, and we don't, you know, we're not big enough that you can get lost in the crowd here.
**Emilydudley**: So if you think you're gonna come and work and you know, things will slide or you don't have to uphold your end and things that you're given or asked to do, then not the place to come, it's just, but it's, it's a rewarding job if you do your job.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, of course, I think that's, you know, really intuitive in the market right now, especially if you're looking for people, you know, with those six years of experience, they're a little bit on that younger side having, you know, that mentality that they can grow up and be a part of something that's going to become a billion dollar company.
**Jdawson**: I definitely think that is a great selling point.
**Jdawson**: And with that, you know, we can really help you with your competitors as well.
**Jdawson**: I know you said you don't know a lot about the general contractors in Indy and you guys are just starting to tap into that market.
**Jdawson**: But we've been established in the Indianapolis market recruiting construction professionals for over seven years.
**Jdawson**: So we can provide you with insights on candidates, market trends, what the competitors are doing, what profiles the competitors are seeing.
**Jdawson**: We work with over 75 general contractors in Indianapolis and you'll be seeing, you know, candidates that they're also interested in as well.
**Jdawson**: So you kind of have the opportunity to see who those companies are bringing on and maybe.
**Jdawson**: Oh, that's someone I want to see as well.
**Emilydudley**: Yeah, I mean, that may be helpful.
**Emilydudley**: Brandon's been, he's from Indiana, so he's been here his whole life on and off.
**Emilydudley**: And so he knows the local area.
**Emilydudley**: Well, you know, Glenn and myself and obvious us guys in Florida, that's not our.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Emilydudley**: Where we have a lot of experience.
**Emilydudley**: But.
**Jdawson**: Are you guys looking to bring on people as well in Florida or just in the Indy office?
**Emilydudley**: Probably not immediately, but in the next six to eight months, I would say we're going to need to hire in Florida.
**Jdawson**: Well, perfect.
**Jdawson**: I'm glad you're chatting with us then because Michael Page is nationwide as well.
**Jdawson**: We do have our teams that only recruit in certain markets.
**Jdawson**: So I'm in Indianapolis construction.
**Jdawson**: We have a Florida based team who knows Florida in the insides and outs.
**Jdawson**: And you know, I'm also from Florida, so know a good bit, got friends in construction who are, you know, construction managers and stuff like that over there as well.
**Jdawson**: So yeah, definitely think that, you know, we'd be a really successful partner with you guys.
**Jdawson**: And really, you know, I'm looking forward to helping you guys.
**Jdawson**: Filled out both offices.
**Emilydudley**: All right, so what are your, what are your rates?
**Emilydudley**: What do you charge for your service?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, so with our contract it is 30% of the candidate's first year guaranteed salary.
**Jdawson**: Then it's with 15 day pay terms.
**Jdawson**: If the payment is due 15 days after their start and the guarantee period is 60 days.
**Jdawson**: So let's say the candidate doesn't work out, you fire them within this first 60 days or you, or they quit within the first 60 days, we will replace them.
**Emilydudley**: All right, I can just tell you typically Brandon doesn't like anything more than 30 days because that takes 30 days to figure out if someone is, you know, who they say they are.
**Jdawson**: Anyways, when you say Brandon doesn't want to do, it's a 60 day guarantee period.
**Jdawson**: So you've got 60 days to figure out if that person's going to work out or not.
**Jdawson**: So we're giving you more time.
**Jdawson**: Are you saying you want to make it less?
**Emilydudley**: Yeah, no, I'm saying like he has to pay you in 15 days when he has no idea the person he's paying for is worth it or not.
**Jdawson**: Right, right, right.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: That's why we offer the free replacement so that, you know, you pay, you pay in the first 15 days.
**Jdawson**: They don't work out, we will replace them for free.
**Emilydudley**: Okay, I'll pass it along to him and let him know, see what he says.
**Jdawson**: All right, perfect.
**Jdawson**: Well, would I know how does all of that really like sound to you?
**Jdawson**: The 30%, the 15 days and 60 day guarantee?
**Emilydudley**: I mean it's, I've seen 20% and then 30%.
**Emilydudley**: So the the.
**Emilydudley**: I don't know what the guarantee is.
**Emilydudley**: Like, you guarantee you'll replace them.
**Emilydudley**: What if it takes six months to find a replacement?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, Emily, she's well versed in this, so she's going to jump in and, you know, talk a little bit more about the contract as well.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: Hey, Jesse.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, Go for it.
**Emilydudley**: I was just saying, like, we've got.
**Emilydudley**: We've hired five recruiters and we haven't hired anyone from them.
**Emilydudley**: So that's what I mean BY like, it's 60 days.
**Emilydudley**: Like, you know.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah.
**Emilydudley**: That's why I just don't know.
**Emilydudley**: What's the difference?
**Emilydudley**: Like it.
**Emilydudley**: What if you've never found someone to replace it?
**Emilydudley**: Like, what do we do?
**Speaker 3**: No, those are great questions.
**Speaker 3**: And with that, I do want to see the recruiters that you have previously worked with in the past.
**Speaker 3**: Are those.
**Speaker 3**: Is it permanent placements, is it contract placements or what?
**Speaker 3**: What have those other recruiters looks like.
**Emilydudley**: That'S for a permanent hire.
**Emilydudley**: That's what you.
**Speaker 3**: Okay.
**Speaker 3**: Yep, yep.
**Speaker 3**: Is it a direct hire or is it a situation where they are technically an employee with the recruiter for X amount of time?
**Speaker 3**: Direct.
**Speaker 3**: Okay, cool.
**Speaker 3**: So no, we're direct hire as well.
**Speaker 3**: Like Stacy mentioned earlier, we are going to be contingent.
**Speaker 3**: So you will only pay if you like a candidate enough to bring him or her onto the team.
**Speaker 3**: So our services are the interview process, you know, the market research in terms of like who's interviewing with your competitors, salary guide, market trends research.
**Speaker 3**: All of that is free of cost for our partners.
**Speaker 3**: What the fee is on our side of things is going to be our established network.
**Speaker 3**: So sorry, like Stacey was saying, we have a team of seven.
**Speaker 3**: My team, every day, all day, we are calling construction professionals in the Indianapolis market, all within the commercial general contracting space.
**Speaker 3**: So with that part of the fees is also paying for that network that we have established over the past seven years.
**Speaker 3**: On top of that, like other recruiters will not only be.
**Speaker 3**: Are not.
**Speaker 3**: They're not specialized in localized.
**Speaker 3**: So they will be recruiting for jobs over in Indianapolis.
**Speaker 3**: They will be recruiting for jobs over in Ohio, in New York, maybe in South Carolina.
**Speaker 3**: And while a lot of them are also construction recruiters, they will also be recruiting for maybe an architect, maybe a mechanical engineer, maybe a project manager or a traveling superintendent.
**Speaker 3**: So they just have a broader cast and a broader net on that side of things.
**Speaker 3**: Whereas our team, we are strictly doing project managers, superintendents and pre construction managers at all levels in the Indianapolis market.
**Speaker 3**: So we really are the more specialized and the more localized because of that the guarantee period, if a candidate does not work out, you let us know.
**Speaker 3**: Typically, we know if it's not going to work out before either the candidate departs the business, whether that's on your side or on theirs.
**Speaker 3**: And we will already get a search going with that.
**Speaker 3**: You also have a lot of other competitors in the Indianapolis market that we partner with.
**Speaker 3**: So odds are we are already looking for maybe a commercial pm.
**Speaker 3**: So we already have someone on that search and we will just prioritize, you know, you guys on that.
**Speaker 3**: So we are still finding candidates and we are getting that.
**Speaker 3**: That candidate replaced there.
**Speaker 3**: How is all of that sounding?
**Cgoodin**: I understand, you know, I understand how that works.
**Cgoodin**: So, you know, it's finding the right person makes that all, like, not even mean anything.
**Cgoodin**: It is what it is to find place that fill that position.
**Speaker 3**: Right?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: Okay.
**Emilydudley**: Yeah, that's it.
**Emilydudley**: I mean, yeah.
**Speaker 3**: But then I was going to say, if for some reason we're unable to find a candidate and maybe say you were on a PM search, we hire a pm.
**Speaker 3**: The PM is there, doesn't end up working out.
**Speaker 3**: And then instead of that, you're like, no, we actually can move some things around internally.
**Speaker 3**: We're looking for a superintendent.
**Speaker 3**: We can be flexible on that side.
**Speaker 3**: And then we can also offer a prorated credit if it's gone too long where it's like we aren't.
**Speaker 3**: We aren't finding the right talent.
**Speaker 3**: And those credits can be used for any replacement on that side of things and do not expire.
**Emilydudley**: Okay.
**Speaker 3**: But after this.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, after this, Stacy can send over our just agreement so you can share that with Brandon.
**Speaker 3**: And if you guys do have any questions, after reviewing more than happy to jump on a phone call with you guys and kind of walk through it there.
**Speaker 3**: But I do want to say, like, we are contingent and then we are also going to be the best recruiters in the Indianapolis space just because we are specialized, localized and with our, you know, larger team on that side.
**Emilydudley**: Okay.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah.
**Emilydudley**: All right.
**Jdawson**: Well, with all that, what do you expect out of us as a recruitment partner?
**Cgoodin**: Just, you know, that's to find that that specialized person not send us a bunch of resumes that match what we're looking for.
**Cgoodin**: And, you know, that's really the main things.
**Cgoodin**: Like.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, no, that makes, that makes total sense to me.
**Jdawson**: Just a little bit about our process is whenever I'm chatting with a candidate who's interested in hopping on the market and looking at new opportunities, I spend 45 minutes to an hour chatting with them, learning about their work history, making sure.
**Jdawson**: You know, if I'm talking to a project manager making sure that they have that fire and sprinkler experience and you know, they're within what you guys are looking for.
**Jdawson**: I spend that hour through their job history, figure out why they've made certain job changes and really why they're looking for new opportunity and go through their compensation because I don't want to send you any candidates that are well outside your range as well.
**Jdawson**: So that's just a little bit about, you know, our process and you know, we, throughout the process as well, we're going to try to make sure that if you guys ever do get an offer out to a candidate, that that offer is going to be accepted by the candidate.
**Jdawson**: We're managing their expectations throughout and we are serving you guys as a client.
**Jdawson**: So we're making sure that they are interested in you guys and it has mutual interest together there.
**Jdawson**: Okay, perfect.
**Jdawson**: Well, I know you mentioned the project manager role in a superintendent role.
**Jdawson**: Is it how many supers, how many project managers and are there any other roles as well?
**Cgoodin**: No, that's it right now.
**Jdawson**: How many, how many PMs and supers do you guys need?
**Cgoodin**: I would say one of each.
**Jdawson**: One of each.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And I noticed you're looking.
**Jdawson**: Are you looking for six years for both of them?
**Cgoodin**: I would prefer that.
**Emilydudley**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And what are some, you know, must haves for that besides the fire and sprinkler system experience?
**Jdawson**: What are some must haves for that?
**Emilydudley**: Project manager for the fire sprinkler pm.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Cgoodin**: It'S mostly that, you know, obviously if they're PM in that they know how to use the computer and Microsoft 365 and you know, just be good on the computer and you know, if they're.
**Cgoodin**: That's why I'm assuming the best route would be maybe someone from a fire sprinkler company is they would know about pricing for, you know, the components of a sprinkler system and know the general codes that apply to sprinklers so that.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Cgoodin**: You know, make those determinations of when we get a job.
**Cgoodin**: They could be able.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: That makes that make.
**Jdawson**: Are you still there?
**Cgoodin**: Yeah, sorry.
**Jdawson**: No worries.
**Jdawson**: What softwares are you guys using?
**Cgoodin**: Well, we have CAD and you know, then just everything on the Microsoft 365.
**Jdawson**: That work perfect and that salary range is 110 to 120.
**Cgoodin**: Yeah.
**Cgoodin**: Depending on their experience and.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, perfect.
**Jdawson**: Well, what about what are your must haves for that superintendent.
**Cgoodin**: Ground up experience is valuable.
**Cgoodin**: If they have any health care experience that's valuable.
**Cgoodin**: They've used construction programs like Procore.
**Cgoodin**: We're using Procore and Job Planner.
**Cgoodin**: So it really just knowing how those programs work.
**Jdawson**: Cool.
**Jdawson**: And with these positions, what you know, personality would really fit in with your guys's culture.
**Cgoodin**: We're pretty laid back and you can't have a thick skin to work here.
**Cgoodin**: We're pretty, we don't have an HR person which is a good thing.
**Cgoodin**: So they're uptight or easily offended is probably not the right place to be.
**Cgoodin**: But it's construction so I would hope they're not that way.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, perfect.
**Jdawson**: I it, I understand.
**Jdawson**: I mean there's some companies out there, you know, who call it a good boys club.
**Jdawson**: They're not a frat.
**Jdawson**: They're not a frat.
**Jdawson**: But you know, it kind of, kind of goes that way.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I don't, I totally understand that and definitely can appreciate that.
**Cgoodin**: Tell you too is like we are a merit based company.
**Cgoodin**: As in there's no favoritism here.
**Cgoodin**: There's no like anyone who joins here is going to be promoted based on what they do and they don't have to worry about coming in.
**Cgoodin**: And we don't play favorites.
**Cgoodin**: Like it's simply, you know, everyone's equally has the ability to get his head as far as they want in this company.
**Cgoodin**: And so that's a definitely our, our company policy is that's how people go places here.
**Cgoodin**: So if they're joining up, they can go as far as they want.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I definitely think that's a great selling point for me to share with candidates.
**Jdawson**: You know, our company here at Michael Page also set up pretty similarly.
**Jdawson**: No one really plays favorites and that's what I appreciate so much about being here.
**Jdawson**: So I appreciate that, you know, you guys have that same atmosphere as well.
**Jdawson**: So do you have, you know, any thoughts or questions about our conversation today?
**Cgoodin**: No, it's all pretty straightforward.
**Jdawson**: Perfect.
**Jdawson**: Well, I can shoot you.
**Jdawson**: I'll shoot you over an email with our contract as well as our salary guide and then once we get that contract back and sign, I can get a hop on the search and based on, you know, what you're looking for, I do think I do have a few candidates who I think would, you know, be someone that you're might be interested in with mostly on the superintendent side would need to go back and double check with the candidates and make sure that you know, they have that fire sprinkler system.
**Jdawson**: But hopefully, you know, if we get that contract back, we can send you over, you know, qualified candidates here.
**Jdawson**: Shortly.
**Jdawson**: When do you think you'd have that contract back to me?
**Cgoodin**: I don't know.
**Cgoodin**: I have to review with Brandon.
**Cgoodin**: I'll look at it.
**Cgoodin**: We'll talk this evening.
**Cgoodin**: And you know, there's this fire sprinkler pm and I know I also needed just a regular project manager.
**Jdawson**: Okay, writing that down.
**Jdawson**: Okay, perfect.
**Jdawson**: Well, I'll shoot you over that email.
**Jdawson**: And when can I give you a call Tomorrow?
**Cgoodin**: I'd have to look at my calendar, but you can send me a text and I'll let you know what time works.
**Jdawson**: Okay, perfect.
**Jdawson**: All righty.
**Cgoodin**: Well, I'll get the regular PM is almost a higher priority than the fire sprinkler one right now, so.
**Jdawson**: Okay, perfect.
**Jdawson**: I am making note of that.
**Jdawson**: And once I get that contract back, I hopefully will have a candidate that sits with you guys.
**Jdawson**: Looking for.
**Cgoodin**: And do you, when you talk to PMs, do most of them have some experience helping with estimating?
**Cgoodin**: Like.
**Jdawson**: That is a great question.
**Jdawson**: Yes, it is very often that we do.
**Jdawson**: I was just working with a candidate who did.
**Jdawson**: We also work with pre construction managers and estimators, which is a kind of a separate position, but some candidates.
**Jdawson**: Yes, they do.
**Jdawson**: It's kind of, you know, change orders typically.
**Jdawson**: You know, typically conceptual bids and takeoffs is what they're doing.
**Cgoodin**: Because we don't like, we're not big enough to have just someone solely doing pre construction.
**Cgoodin**: So like the PMs are involved in that.
**Cgoodin**: You know, we got this estimator coming on soon that should be doing the.
**Cgoodin**: The daily estimating chores.
**Cgoodin**: But when it comes to that number is finally ready to go together, that PN needs to be able to look at it and provide input to make sure.
**Cgoodin**: Hey, he's looked at the drawings.
**Cgoodin**: And.
**Jdawson**: So do all of your project managers also estimate they assist with it?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, they assist with it.
**Jdawson**: Okay, perfect.
**Jdawson**: And I have another question.
**Jdawson**: Oh, with that superintendent, is this a traveling superintendent?
**Cgoodin**: This could probably be local.
**Jdawson**: Local, okay.
**Cgoodin**: Or, you know, some.
**Cgoodin**: Some of the traveling is simply going somewhere, especially on these sprinkler jobs for a week or every other week or something like that.
**Cgoodin**: And then while they're working out of here as well.
**Cgoodin**: So.
**Cgoodin**: But really we a super for Indianapolis.
**Cgoodin**: It's going to do projects here.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, of course.
**Jdawson**: Well, that's just the reason I asked that question, because Michael Page is nationwide.
**Jdawson**: If you ever do need a traveler, our teams, you know, send us travelers in our inbox as well who are, you know, looking for new opportunities to also travel nationwide.
**Jdawson**: So if that need is ever there, you've got all of our offices finding traveling superintendents for you.
**Jdawson**: Okay, perfect.
**Jdawson**: Well, I will get that email sent over to you with our contract.
**Jdawson**: Do you want me to cc Brandon on it?
**Cgoodin**: Yeah, you can.
**Jdawson**: Okay, perfect.
**Jdawson**: Alrighty.
**Jdawson**: Well, I'll get that sent over to you and follow up with you tomorrow.
