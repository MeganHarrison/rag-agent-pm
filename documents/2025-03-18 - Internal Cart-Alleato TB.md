**Jdawson**: How's everybody doing?
**Jdawson**: Good.
**Jdawson**: How are you?
**Jdawson**: Good.
**Ataylor**: I don't know.
**Jdawson**: How did the government meeting go last week?
**Ataylor**: It was good.
**Ataylor**: We honestly didn't really get a whole ton of information on timing, so I don't really have a whole lot in terms of updates.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: We got some feedback on the audit stuff that we were working through that we have some more stuff to work through.
**Ataylor**: So right now that's kind of the major focus to just get some more of this documentation.
**Ataylor**: What did he say?
**Ataylor**: Did you sound hungover from Promat?
**Ataylor**: No, I'm not at Promat.
**Ataylor**: Office looks cool, though.
**Ataylor**: Is that your office?
**Ataylor**: Did you in the back?
**Jdawson**: I'm down in Tampa visiting the guys.
**Ataylor**: Nice.
**Ataylor**: Did give real op the all the stuff.
**Ataylor**: They actually reached out and I, they asked for a bunch more documentation and I just told them that our lawyers talk to their lawyers and here's the approval of the permit being closed.
**Ataylor**: So we consider this matter closed on our end and it's been several days and have not heard anything back.
**Ataylor**: So I think, you know, no news so far is good news.
**Ataylor**: Knock on wood.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: They were requesting more information on the permit.
**Ataylor**: Well, he just was just pushing on all that stuff about like the, the deck and structural stuff and supports, and I just told him we're not giving him any of that.
**Ataylor**: Good.
**Jdawson**: No, you go ahead.
**Ataylor**: Sorry, that's really all I got.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Mitch, I got one.
**Bclymer**: Mitch just called and said the covers on the arms at the gates have keys and he's going to need access to it in order to wire them.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, he, he, he texted me.
**Jdawson**: So I'll get those to him.
**Jdawson**: Mike wants to not left him, so I, I, I wanted him to leave him with you, Eric.
**Jdawson**: So that's why Mitch probably asked.
**Jdawson**: So that's, that's news to me.
**Jdawson**: So I, I'll get to the bottom of it and get him squared away.
**Jdawson**: I know they caught the concrete cut up and so the boring guy should show up tomorrow.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Tomorrow is what we're thinking.
**Jdawson**: He didn't give an exact day, but will be bored and have power to them this week and we'll be done.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: When, when you hear that we're having people, whatever, just let me know what date because like, I never know.
