## Transcript
**Speaker 9999**: Okay.
**Speaker 9999**: Yeah, I was a Dell account manager.
**Speaker 9999**: I was the one who kind of brought Dell to Emit.
**Dworsham**: Yeah.
**Esetka**: You guys did a lot of work in Austin and as well, Lebanon.
**Esetka**: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Esetka**: I've been to both those sites, so I did a lot.
**Dworsham**: Before he joined.
**Ataylor**: Gus was saying he's known David Darst since, like, 2006, so I'm surprised you guys didn't cross paths before.
**Ataylor**: We probably did.
**Ataylor**: I remember we probably did.
**Dworsham**: We did a few projects at the Gap.
**Esetka**: We did some projects a couple of other places.
**Esetka**: We did one for Carhartt a couple of years ago.
**Esetka**: So if you were doing them, I'm out of Austin, so if you were doing more stuff out of Nashville, that could be why.
**Dworsham**: Okay.
**Dworsham**: All right.
**Dworsham**: Well, it's.
**Esetka**: It's nice to meet you guys virtually here.
**Esetka**: Appreciate it.
**Esetka**: This is Alicia.
**Esetka**: I don't know if you guys probably know Alicia a lot more than I, you know, you know me.
**Esetka**: So Alicia is leading the project 3D, but we wanted to get this call to align on the main control panel for next week.
**Esetka**: There were talks as far as timeline and so forth.
**Esetka**: I want to make sure, from our perspective, we're aware of the downtime, the details that are going to impact operation, so we can mitigate any risk to the business.
**Esetka**: So I think, first of all, before we start, do we have everyone needed on the call?
**Esetka**: So I know I have a couple of people here on my side sitting with me in the room.
**Esetka**: J.P. and Paula.
**Esetka**: Hello.
**Esetka**: Sitting in the room here.
**Ataylor**: It's just me and Donnie right now.
**Ataylor**: I invited Eric.
**Ataylor**: So Eric is the controls engineer.
**Ataylor**: He's actually going to be there this weekend.
**Ataylor**: I don't know if he accepted, but we can go ahead and get started with Adam.
**Ataylor**: I also invited AJ for Molito.
**Ataylor**: He's working with the team, and I don't know if you accept it either, but we.
**Ataylor**: We can get going with just me and Donnie.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Esetka**: So I don't know if you guys have a detailed schedule.
**Esetka**: Maybe you can start with that one.
**Esetka**: Just to kind of get the team all up to speed on the same page as far as schedule, but as far as What I'm aware of is that it's.
**Esetka**: The MCP move is going to happen the week of the 28th.
**Esetka**: We want to go through those details.
**Esetka**: You know, the cutoff time, the winter time, we're coming back and so forth, the risks, all the details.
**Esetka**: So whatever you can share just to get us up to speed, that would be a good start here.
**Ataylor**: So we are going to.
**Ataylor**: I'm talking With Alicia yesterday or the day before or whatever, we are going to basically turn the panel off as soon as we can on the 27th, which is Friday.
**Ataylor**: So she said.
**Ataylor**: There's Eric.
**Ataylor**: So she said we should be able to get started probably around 4 or 5pm Something like that.
**Ataylor**: Is that, is that so we can, we can start you a little early.
**Esetka**: Josh, are you on Joshua, he's the facility director, he told me we can, we can start at 2:30.
**Esetka**: So they're going to try, they're.
**Esetka**: They're going to shoot for 2:30, but at 2:30 you can start the work.
**Ataylor**: Okay, let me, let me make it 2:30pm on 27.
**Ataylor**: Got it.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, yeah.
**Ataylor**: Every hour we can get confirming.
**Ataylor**: Policy is confirming.
**Esetka**: She needs to do something with it.
**Esetka**: But as a placeholder.
**Esetka**: Yes, I mean that's.
**Esetka**: Let's shoot for 230 if something moves up or down and we'll give you a heads up.
**Esetka**: Yeah, I think, I think what Paul is mentioning is we need probably like half an hour.
**Esetka**: Our.
**Esetka**: IT wants to shut down the workstations associated with that are being powered before we turn and make sure we turn everything down, cut them.
**Esetka**: Right.
**Esetka**: Yeah.
**Esetka**: Need a half hour buffer for it to.
**Esetka**: Yeah.
**Esetka**: So let's say 230 to 3.
**Esetka**: But we will confirm.
**Esetka**: Yeah.
**Esetka**: Okay.
**Esetka**: Okay, that's fine.
**Esetka**: We'll have some guys driving up from Nashville from the chemical team.
**Ataylor**: Electricians are local obviously, so that's, that's fine.
**Ataylor**: We'll get there a little bit early to make sure everything's good to go.
**Ataylor**: Eric, I don't know if you joined soon enough, but the plan for radial to shut up the panel is roughly around 2:30 on, on Friday the 27th.
**Ataylor**: That work for you?
**Ataylor**: Drive up that morning and be there kind of for the shutdown with the electricians.
**Esetka**: All right, you're on mute.
**Esetka**: All right.
**Ataylor**: I'm gonna take silence as a yes, but we can go ahead and move on.
**Ataylor**: I don't know if he's on a call or something, but yeah, that'll work.
**Ataylor**: So yeah, you have the.
**Esetka**: Sorry, but you have the rest.
**Esetka**: So eventually operation is planning to go back up on Sunday the.
**Esetka**: At 6:30 or 7:00 clock on Sunday.
**Esetka**: Yeah, so, but.
**Esetka**: So we have this time between the time we said on Friday until Sunday morning.
**Esetka**: You can arrange your teams and you know, supporting cast work any way you see fit between those periods.
**Esetka**: But this is the time that's available for now.
**Esetka**: So Sunday morning.
**Ataylor**: I think it's gonna be a problem.
**Ataylor**: We are planning on having all of Sunday to work and bringing it up Monday morning, talking with Dean.
**Ataylor**: I think it's gonna be quite a stretch to do the panel move, repo all the wires, redo the conduit, work all that stuff and get it back up and going in a day and a half.
**Ataylor**: I think that's gonna be really tight.
**Ataylor**: Is it one crew who's working on this one?
**Esetka**: I mean, what can we do to use Saturday, you know, being a full day off?
**Esetka**: Is there anything we can do?
**Esetka**: Add resources to help us, you know, come back on Sunday?
**Esetka**: I mean, we could check.
**Ataylor**: That's going to be a change in my opinion.
**Ataylor**: Donnie, what's, what's your comfort level with trying to do this move in a day and a half?
**Ataylor**: I think.
**Dworsham**: I mean the original plan was to do it all day, like you said, all day.
**Dworsham**: We were originally, we weren't talking about Fridays, we were just talking about Saturday, Sunday.
**Dworsham**: And that was already going to be like full day.
**Dworsham**: Full like basically happened till Monday morning.
**Dworsham**: So.
**Dworsham**: But we were.
**Dworsham**: The plan was to finish up by a decent hour on Sunday.
**Dworsham**: I think it starts getting to be where, yeah, we'd have to even see if the electricians are available for that or not.
**Dworsham**: And yeah, that's a big change when you have a, a two day period and you lose one day, you're.
**Dworsham**: I mean, you lost 50 of your work time.
**Dworsham**: So that becomes.
**Dworsham**: Yeah, we'll have to have some, which we did some of Friday, of course.
**Dworsham**: But yeah, it doesn't leave a lot of room for any contingency.
**Esetka**: You know, it's just a sorter that will be down.
**Esetka**: Right.
**Mmcdowell**: Like we'll be able to pack.
**Mmcdowell**: We just have to manually sort or sideline it until Monday when it's running.
**Dworsham**: Well, it's, it's just, it's not the, it's the conveyor.
**Dworsham**: That's the ground conveyor and all that will be down.
**Dworsham**: Right, right, right.
**Dworsham**: But like it's not like they can't pack still.
**Mmcdowell**: You know, it's not like the whole like the power's down for the building.
**Mmcdowell**: So like we don't even have any pickups on Sunday.
**Mmcdowell**: Right, Gus?
**Mmcdowell**: So like, I mean, I know it's not ideal, but we could just put them in Game Lords.
**Mmcdowell**: Correct.
**Esetka**: So I understand, but I want to make sure like, you know, we don't push beyond what's not available.
**Esetka**: I mean, so, you know, so I don't expedite, I don't know what it is, so.
**Esetka**: But Right, so let's see what's so.
**Esetka**: But to Alicia's Point packing stations and all other functions are available during this time.
**Esetka**: Is that correct or incorrect assumptions?
**Esetka**: Yeah, yeah, we're just powering the conveyor down.
**Ataylor**: So yeah, just.
**Esetka**: The conveyor will not be operational during this period.
**Esetka**: You can do whatever around the conveyor.
**Esetka**: Worst case scenario.
**Esetka**: Worst case scenario.
**Esetka**: I know they're planning to have 10,000 units and I think the average is like three.
**Esetka**: So that's call it, you know, 3,000 orders.
**Esetka**: I want to make sure if.
**Esetka**: And we're still going to try to shoot for it being available on Sunday.
**Esetka**: But I'm just trying to put all the contingencies in place to support this project.
**Esetka**: So we can pack, we can process orders, but we cannot put anything on the conveyor during that period.
**Esetka**: That's what I heard you guys say.
**Esetka**: Correct?
**Esetka**: Correct.
**Esetka**: That is correct.
**Esetka**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: And we will get it operational as fast as we can, but I don't want to commit to getting it running first thing Sunday morning just in case, you know, there's a slight issue, you know, oh, this wire got cut or whatever or we're having issues getting it back up and running.
**Ataylor**: We need a little bit of contingency time to, you know, leave room for some troubleshooting just in case something.
**Ataylor**: Something happens.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Esetka**: Now, now the plan is on Monday morning that conveyor line will be back up.
**Esetka**: So that induct to disorder should be back on with no issues.
**Esetka**: I know there's a new induct being set up, but inducted disorder on that original line should be working and it should be no issues on Monday morning.
**Esetka**: I'm assuming if we stay with this plan.
**Esetka**: Yes, that is, that is, that will be tested before we leave on Sunday and then we'd have somebody there Monday morning to.
**Dworsham**: During startup.
**Dworsham**: So go ahead.
**Esetka**: I'm sorry, so it's JP.
**Esetka**: So I'm just.
**Esetka**: I know AJ's there and Dean's going to be involved.
**Esetka**: So there's a couple like.
**Esetka**: So for this move, I'm just trying to think of a simplistic things task.
**Esetka**: What, what are the tasks and what if anything can be done prior to, to alleviate some of this issue and then what, you know, can't be done until after the panel's set and in place.
**Esetka**: Right.
**Esetka**: So the first thing is obviously we have to disconnect the panel, power it down and then move it.
**Esetka**: Right.
**Esetka**: So we know the new location.
**Esetka**: We're good.
**Esetka**: Then we're going to extend the panel feed right to the new location right there.
**Esetka**: We can do, we can do that.
**Esetka**: I'm just, let me just go kind of go through.
**Esetka**: Right.
**Esetka**: So that has to be done right.
**Esetka**: Regardless, you know, that maybe it could be done before, but so that has to be done right.
**Esetka**: So now we have the new panel.
**Esetka**: It's new place.
**Esetka**: The new.
**Esetka**: The new power feed is there.
**Esetka**: Right.
**Esetka**: And then obviously we have to connect, I guess now reconnect everything for the existing convey.
**Esetka**: Right, Right.
**Esetka**: So that's another task.
**Esetka**: Right?
**Esetka**: Reconnect, Connect it to that panel, Right?
**Esetka**: Yes.
**Dworsham**: And then what's.
**Esetka**: What's left after that?
**Esetka**: The remaining demo.
**Ataylor**: So for this project, what's remaining after that is.
**Dworsham**: Then we powered it.
**Dworsham**: We powered a panel back on and test where we start everything back up.
**Dworsham**: See that everything runs flag photo eyes, you know, to make it stop, and then hit reset buttons and test it through its.
**Dworsham**: Plug it through some.
**Esetka**: Some testing, which, you know, obviously you need to do.
**Esetka**: As far as the physical work, you know, it's mainly cutting the feed, extending the feed, moving the panel, reconnecting the feed.
**Esetka**: Right.
**Esetka**: And then reconnect and connecting, you know, from the existing conveyor to the.
**Esetka**: Reconnecting that part, right?
**Esetka**: Yeah.
**Esetka**: And actually that's the part I was jumping in earlier.
**Dworsham**: The feed they're going to work on in advance.
**Dworsham**: So the new.
**Dworsham**: So the feed will be coming.
**Dworsham**: It won't.
**Dworsham**: They're not extending the feed.
**Dworsham**: That feed comes from the far end away.
**Dworsham**: So they're running a new feed, a new feed from the other side of the building that'll be sitting there waiting.
**Dworsham**: Okay, so new feed.
**Dworsham**: Fine.
**Dworsham**: That's.
**Esetka**: That's perfectly fine.
**Esetka**: So, yeah, new feed.
**Esetka**: But that should all be in the area, right?
**Esetka**: Yes.
**Esetka**: Yeah, the plan is to have that done.
**Dworsham**: Like they do it, you know, during the week, next week, and get it sitting there waiting.
**Dworsham**: Yeah, so it's waiting.
**Esetka**: Then we disconnect the old feed and we'll demo that as needed.
**Esetka**: But, you know, that's no time frame.
**Esetka**: Just disconnect it, turn the breaker off, disconnect it.
**Esetka**: Then you guys move the panel, put it in its new place, and then we got to wait for the.
**Esetka**: Then the next step.
**Esetka**: Right.
**Esetka**: Then I guess you have to do all the connections for the existing conveyor, blah, blah, blah.
**Esetka**: And then we connect and power it up.
**Esetka**: Yes.
**Dworsham**: And since all the wiring is getting shorter, the ideas, they'll go past that curve.
**Dworsham**: It's the curve for that, for what used to be the Geek plus line, the area where the panel is going to be.
**Dworsham**: They'll pull it apart there and have all the wires there.
**Dworsham**: Like they'll pull them all out the conduit and have Them waiting there and then they move the panel, connect it to that conduit and feed all those wires back in and literally just trim them to length and land them back on the same terminals they were on before and put a new wire label.
**Dworsham**: So.
**Dworsham**: Yeah.
**Esetka**: So I guess the day.
**Esetka**: So I'm just trying to think and I'm.
**Esetka**: I'm not.
**Esetka**: You know, you guys know the business better than I do.
**Esetka**: But if we have the power feed run next week, we have.
**Esetka**: The panel is going to move Friday night.
**Esetka**: Right.
**Esetka**: So that's going to be moved and set.
**Esetka**: Right.
**Esetka**: We'll have.
**Esetka**: The new power feed is waiting to be connected.
**Esetka**: You'll have pre work done where you're waiting can connect.
**Esetka**: You do final work and connect into that panel starting I'm assuming on Saturday.
**Esetka**: Right.
**Esetka**: So we're saying Saturday it's going to take or Saturday and Sunday.
**Esetka**: And I know there's a testing so we'll leave it out.
**Esetka**: But just the physical work.
**Esetka**: Are you going to be able to get it all?
**Esetka**: So it's Saturday, the day you're getting everything hooked up and then you need time for testing and you're leaving a little leeway for issues or is it because it doesn't feel like it's two days worth of electrical work?
**Esetka**: Right.
**Esetka**: It's quite a few.
**Dworsham**: So there's quite a few wires that get pulled out and put back in and re landed and it just takes time to pull them back all back in and.
**Dworsham**: And reconnecting all the.
**Dworsham**: Reconnect them all.
**Ataylor**: And yeah, hopefully we are going to do it in a way where you don't have to re bend much pipe, but there's probably going to be a little bit.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Esetka**: You can't put six guys on that because you can't have six guys terminating them.
**Esetka**: No.
**Esetka**: Yeah.
**Esetka**: Too many guests in the kitchen.
**Dworsham**: That's the fun part is you.
**Dworsham**: When you're.
**Dworsham**: You could have people work out on conduit, but until you get the conduit, you have a few people probably work on it till you get that set up and run into the panel.
**Dworsham**: You start running the wires back in, then it just becomes like two.
**Dworsham**: Only two.
**Dworsham**: Like a couple guys can be working at the same time.
**Dworsham**: One who's feeding wire ones who's pulling them.
**Dworsham**: And then it's hard to get more than one person in front of a panel to.
**Dworsham**: You know, if you have two door.
**Dworsham**: Like it's two door panels.
**Dworsham**: So you might have one guy on each side, but most of it happens in the right side door.
**Dworsham**: So you literally just have one person in there doing it.
**Dworsham**: You can't cram another person in.
**Dworsham**: Yeah, I just want to be able to.
**Dworsham**: Yeah, yeah, I understand.
**Esetka**: I just want to be able to.
**Esetka**: Because we're gonna have to explain, you know, because you know, there's testing, there's, you know, it's, it's not nine women, a baby in a month.
**Esetka**: Right, right.
**Esetka**: Of, you know, you can't, you can't have multiple people terminating the same control panel at the same time possible.
**Esetka**: So the pre work, can we get some of that done?
**Esetka**: Yeah, I guess what would make us feel better maybe a little bit is and it doesn't have to be exact but since we have a little time is like, all right, here's the date of all.
**Esetka**: Here's the dates we're going to do pre work, these tasks.
**Esetka**: And so, you know, next week we're going to do X, Y and Z.
**Esetka**: This is all going to be done Saturday we're going to be doing the final, you know, final conduit wire pulling start terminal, you know, start termination.
**Esetka**: Sunday we're finishing.
**Esetka**: Like we just need to be able to present to our folks like this is why it's taking this time and why we can't just, you know, compress it or reduce it with more resources.
**Esetka**: You know what I'm saying?
**Esetka**: Yeah.
**Esetka**: And the other comment I would say to your point, JP is I don't want to leave test for Monday.
**Esetka**: We, we will have product available to throw on the conveyor, you know, Sunday, I mean for, for from whatever they generate.
**Esetka**: So assuming we can buy time for Sunday again, I'm going to.
**Esetka**: I invited operation but they weren't able to join.
**Esetka**: But assuming we can put product to the side, we can test anything we want on Sunday after you guys are done.
**Esetka**: We can throw on as many packages as you want, you know, to, to, to test it.
**Esetka**: So I'd like not to test anything on Monday unless we have to.
**Esetka**: I'd like to have this wrapped up on Monday so I mean on Sunday night.
**Esetka**: So if that's possible.
**Esetka**: Yeah.
**Esetka**: Yes.
**Esetka**: The plan was to test on Sunday.
**Dworsham**: The reason I'm the Monday is just production support.
**Dworsham**: So basically you've already tested it, but you still have someone in sight just in case some weird scenario pops up that didn't come up during testing that somebody's right there to just jump on it.
**Dworsham**: You know, if all goes according to plan, then we won't be doing anything on Monday.
**Ataylor**: We'll just be sitting there hanging out.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, okay.
**Esetka**: And just for perspective on this, like if they can't run it Sunday.
**Mmcdowell**: Right.
**Mmcdowell**: Like you said, 3,000 orders.
**Mmcdowell**: I mean, I don't know what the capacity is on this order, but our slow sorter and Buford is 60 per minute.
**Mmcdowell**: I mean, that's one hour of packages, you know, so, like, they can throw that on Monday morning.
**Mmcdowell**: It's not a huge amount to sideline and either manually sort or throw on the conveyor, you know, once it's running.
**Mmcdowell**: Because like we said, it's not picking up Sunday anyway.
**Mmcdowell**: So that makes Pops feel a little better, like it's not a huge disruption.
**Mmcdowell**: Right.
**Ataylor**: And if we get done early on Sunday and everything's working according to plan, then we'll turn it over early.
**Ataylor**: But, yeah, I just don't want to commit to getting it.
**Ataylor**: Alicia.
**Esetka**: It's about two hours worth of order sortation on that line, so.
**Esetka**: Well, yeah, so, I mean, if we.
**Esetka**: I work with Joshua to see if we can have someone come in early or even on Sunday after we.
**Esetka**: They finish the work to throw on, I'll be here on that Sunday.
**Esetka**: So whatever we need to kind of get it out of the way, we will.
**Esetka**: We will work through that.
**Esetka**: So.
**Esetka**: But it's about two hours.
**Esetka**: Looking at the capacity, it's two hours worth of work to be thrown on the line.
**Esetka**: So is there no pre work that you could do during the week that then cuts back and reduces the amount of work, gets ahead of things that you're not doing it on Friday night?
**Esetka**: Only the feeder, only the power feed.
**Ataylor**: Everything else is powered up.
**Dworsham**: You can't disconnect the wires to right now because they're actually operating the equipment.
**Dworsham**: So it's literally disconnecting all those wires inside the panel.
**Dworsham**: Got it.
**Dworsham**: And moving the panel and reconnecting it further down onto the same conduit, just a couple hundred feet down.
**Dworsham**: So.
**Dworsham**: No, unfortunately not so.
**Esetka**: And there's no data in there that we need to worry about giving you data on the other end.
**Esetka**: When it moves, it's just electric.
**Esetka**: Yeah, yeah.
**Esetka**: There's the.
**Dworsham**: The only quote unquote data is the line has a couple Ethernet cables, but they just become a lot shorter.
**Dworsham**: So then they just get pulled back and rerouted with the wiring because there's a.
**Dworsham**: There's some VFDs on the curves, so.
**Dworsham**: But they just get run.
**Dworsham**: You know, we'll make sure our guys also have some Ethernet cable on site and a crimper.
**Dworsham**: So if a Ethernet cable got damaged, it's easy enough to run a new one or repair.
**Dworsham**: Yeah.
**Dworsham**: One other question.
**Esetka**: I know everyone we have Here from Storage Solution.
**Esetka**: We don't have anyone from Deems Electric.
**Esetka**: I could be wrong but how can we confirm all the stuff with them to make sure they're aligned and we have 100% solid plan here.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, I talked to him yesterday.
**Ataylor**: I mean I'll take care of it but so far nothing deviates from that plan.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Esetka**: So I own talking to Joshua here on this.
**Esetka**: Taking the line, the, the conveyor line.
**Esetka**: Is there anything else we needed to kind of COVID in here?
**Esetka**: And I'd like, I mean to JP's point, if you can send us a detailed line item plan as far as what's going to happen.
**Esetka**: You know, a test plan per day.
**Esetka**: Right.
**Esetka**: And the relative timing you think just so everybody can say, all right this, this is a three hour job determining.
**Esetka**: It's six hours, whatever it is.
**Esetka**: Just we need to kind of.
**Esetka**: We need to show why the operation needs to be shut down is what we're getting at.
**Esetka**: Right.
**Esetka**: So.
**Esetka**: Or why they have to deviate from their standard Sunday.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, I mean I can, I can estimate that's not going to be very accurate just to be blunt.
**Ataylor**: I'm not going to have the electricians try to throw something together.
**Ataylor**: But if everything goes according to plan we'd be done by end of day Saturday.
**Ataylor**: But it doesn't leave any room for any testing or any, any issues basically.
**Ataylor**: So all we're looking for is round numbers and estimate.
**Esetka**: We're, we're not holding it to you but we, we need to, we need to have the operation prepared that their, their Sunday is going to be disrupted and.
**Esetka**: Yeah.
**Esetka**: You know.
**Esetka**: Yeah Matt, as far as day work hours and stuff.
**Esetka**: So Friday evening you guys, let's say we stick with the plan.
**Esetka**: It's 2:30, 3:00, you guys are on from a security perspective and having someone else here.
**Esetka**: What should we plan on?
**Esetka**: Like you guys are here till when and the same thing for Saturday and Sunday.
**Esetka**: Can, can you let us know what you guys need just to make sure we have the right team here in place?
**Ataylor**: Yeah, let me double check the team on what their land hours are going to be.
**Ataylor**: Probably around 8ish for Friday night.
**Ataylor**: Saturday I would assume 7am and probably working 12 hour day.
**Ataylor**: Okay, so I'll double check and I'll choose with the schedule.
**Esetka**: Yeah, that would be good but what I heard already to call it 2:30 till 8 on Friday.
**Esetka**: Start Saturday 12 hours from 7 or 8 o' clock Sunday, whatever is needed.
**Esetka**: But it's going to be similar starting at 7 or 8 o' clock.
**Esetka**: Until we're done.
**Esetka**: Yeah.
**Esetka**: Okay.
**Esetka**: Yes.
**Mmcdowell**: They have 247 security there too, so it won't be an issue.
**Mmcdowell**: Okay.
**Esetka**: Yeah, the only.
**Esetka**: The only thing, Alicia, just from a IT support and ESS and so forth.
**Esetka**: We just need to align with those guys just to make sure they're on standby, you know, in case anything is needed from their side.
**Esetka**: Yep.
**Esetka**: Okay.
**Esetka**: Anything else?
**Esetka**: Anyone?
**Esetka**: Good.
**Ataylor**: For my side, I think.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Esetka**: In with having tentative proposed, like, installations dates.
**Mmcdowell**: I know that was tbd.
**Mmcdowell**: I was curious.
**Mmcdowell**: So we're actually roughly outlined.
**Ataylor**: We're going to keep our mechanical crew there until the third.
**Ataylor**: So we'll do most of the install.
**Ataylor**: Then we might even do the mechanical cut in, since that conveyor where that curve needs to cut in, I don't believe it needs to be running.
**Ataylor**: But then we will still need to schedule the controls cut in, you know, update the hmi, update the drawings and all that stuff.
**Ataylor**: But hopefully we can have the physical conveyor mechanically installed by the end of the week on the third.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Mmcdowell**: And no concerns on having the controls piece done before, like, end of August, right?
**Mmcdowell**: I think late August they have a sale or maybe it's early September.
**Mmcdowell**: No, that's just.
**Mmcdowell**: Okay.
**Esetka**: Are we good?
**Esetka**: Gus, Anything else?
**Esetka**: No, not from my side.
**Esetka**: I think we're good.
**Esetka**: Sounds good.
**Esetka**: Matthew, gonna follow up with some detail, hopefully.
**Esetka**: Maybe you can provide that by tomorrow.
**Esetka**: Yeah, I'll connect with OBS here after this call just to make sure we're aligned and, you know, hopefully we can make this happen.
**Esetka**: Cool.
**Esetka**: All right, sounds good.
**Esetka**: Thanks, everyone.
**Esetka**: Appreciate it, guys.
**Esetka**: Thank you.
**Esetka**: Thank you.
