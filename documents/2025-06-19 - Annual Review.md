## Transcript
**Ataylor**: They call those guys.
**Ataylor**: They were.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I don't remember.
**Bclymer**: I know you.
**Bclymer**: Where is this at dangerous diamond.
**Ataylor**: DeAngelis and so field supervisor or something like that?
**Bclymer**: Some.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, like operations manager.
**Ataylor**: They were like over all the supers and the job sites.
**Ataylor**: And he, you know, he was a field engineer on one of my projects previously.
**Ataylor**: So I told him, I said, nick, like, you got this title.
**Ataylor**: You're supposed to come overview jobs and help the teams or guide them or direct them.
**Ataylor**: I said, but how many ground ups have you done from start to finish as the person in charge?
**Ataylor**: And he said, I don't think he did one.
**Ataylor**: He came in midway on one.
**Ataylor**: I said, so, you know, good for you.
**Ataylor**: You got the title.
**Ataylor**: I said, well, you're not going to come to my job and tell me anything about like anything that's going on out here just because, all right, you haven't had the experience.
**Ataylor**: And I said, unless you do like three of them of different types and different areas and different subs, how are you even going to know what these guys are going through?
**Ataylor**: Because you had nothing to base it on.
**Ataylor**: So.
**Ataylor**: And that's all I'm saying is like, we want you to like, gain that experience, which, you know, it's tough just where we're at there's.
**Ataylor**: It's not like you're just going to be a PM now for five years or three years.
**Ataylor**: So that's why you just gotta get all the information you can and lead as a team member almost with these guys you're with, because you're learning as they are learning.
**Ataylor**: But 100, as long as you're in with everything that's going on and you understand it, like, you can learn and then just grow into that role and then you're actually, hey, I am project exec because I know what I'm doing, I know what these guys are doing and going through and you can help lead and guide them.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I think that's a big part.
**Bclymer**: Like, I know I don't have the experience.
**Bclymer**: I want the experience.
**Bclymer**: Right?
**Bclymer**: I want it, I want it all.
**Bclymer**: But I do think, you know, you said lead.
**Bclymer**: Like, I do think I have those qualities to be more of a lead.
**Bclymer**: I mean, I do a lot more than project management.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: I can estimate.
**Bclymer**: I can clearly, you know, I can talk to clients and at least try to bring in work.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: I don't have all the time in the world to do that.
**Bclymer**: It's probably gonna get less.
**Bclymer**: Like, I'm gonna have to figure out how I want because that's ultimately Where I'm gonna be at more on the front end of things and not in the weeds.
**Bclymer**: So I, you know, there's, I think there's ways to be a project exec without the experience and that's more like in a leadership role and you know, getting a lot better at knowing when to not have the answers.
**Bclymer**: Right?
**Bclymer**: That's what gets you in trouble.
**Bclymer**: So I mean, I, you know, I record all my meetings and I, I probably need to go through, just have Maria, which that would take hours, but like watch every media and watch how many times I say, what does that mean?
**Bclymer**: Right?
**Bclymer**: Like, or what is that right?
**Bclymer**: You know, like, I mean, it's constantly, you know, I'm not ashamed, like, I don't care, you know, I, I, you know, there's no shame in that.
**Bclymer**: Like, the worst part is about anything, like hell.
**Bclymer**: I call yesterday with Uniqlo, right, that engineer, you know, I was on mute, but he, he had said something, oh yeah, this will work, blah, blah.
**Bclymer**: And then three minutes later he goes, oh, actually I just ran a calc.
**Bclymer**: That won't work.
**Bclymer**: Like, why are you saying that isn't like, act like.
**Bclymer**: And then I'm sitting there, like I said, I literally go, I said, what a dumbass.
**Bclymer**: Right?
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Like, come on.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And that's the, that's the last thing you want to do.
**Bclymer**: So, so I, I'm ready.
**Bclymer**: Like, I think I have the qualities from a leadership role and being able to, to lead without all the answers and lean on the people that do know.
**Bclymer**: So yeah, I don't have the ground up experience and the only way I'm going to get that is by keeping just living, I guess, letting the years go by so well.
**Bclymer**: Like, well, which sucks because I know I can do it, but.
**Ataylor**: Well, you don't know when we get a, you know, ground up job or whatever, like if you're the manager, then you can't just, you know, you need to take the time now like when they get a submittal for the structure, the foundations that, you know, now it's behooves you to go in and even wait till it gets reviewed by the engineers or whoever or the PM on site that's got that experience.
**Ataylor**: And then just look at the things they mark up and look at the things they look at.
**Ataylor**: Like that's how you can gain experience without actually having, you know, being there.
**Ataylor**: And then like you say, like just being supportive of the things that they do need.
**Ataylor**: You know, if they're looking for help or they're looking for someone making Answers like, that's how you can.
**Ataylor**: People get over the fact that I know more than this person.
**Ataylor**: What are they doing when you can actually help, you know, lighten their load somehow with however you help with the management or dealing with owners or getting them answers, things like that.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: So I'm ready, man.
**Bclymer**: I've been learning so much.
**Bclymer**: It's been great.
**Bclymer**: So I can't, like, imagine me three years ago when you first got me.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: I mean, you had him at hello.
**Bclymer**: Still struggle with being on time.
**Bclymer**: Oh, that's changed.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Whatever.
**Bclymer**: First time we went somewhere.
**Bclymer**: When was that?
**Bclymer**: When we fly out.
**Bclymer**: Oh, yeah.
**Bclymer**: That's tough.
**Bclymer**: Have you heard that story?
**Bclymer**: We talk, tell it later.
**Bclymer**: But I was late to the flight.
**Bclymer**: I was the last person on the flight.
**Bclymer**: Popped a tire on the way.
**Bclymer**: And I'd done Brandon like, what, just a couple weeks.
**Bclymer**: He's like, all right.
**Bclymer**: First flight, I was meeting radial guys.
**Bclymer**: I told him to leave it on the side of the road.
**Bclymer**: I was gonna pick him up.
**Bclymer**: And I did.
**Ataylor**: Nice.
**Bclymer**: Literally, I was like, where are you?
**Bclymer**: He's like, I'm.
**Bclymer**: I'm at whatever.
**Bclymer**: I said, all right, I'm turning around.
**Bclymer**: I'm gonna come get you.
**Bclymer**: For the record, was going to be Brandon there, but he had done this before.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I.
**Bclymer**: I mean, I know exactly what I'm doing, so.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: All right.
**Ataylor**: Costly mistakes.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: PUD changes at Crate.
**Ataylor**: So obviously, sometimes things go wrong, so.
**Ataylor**: But like this, when you look at just procedures and these are things you'd learn, and, like, that's a good learning experience.
**Ataylor**: If you're running a job and you got guys on it, you're checking that they're not changing things and they're having things documented.
**Ataylor**: That's the big thing.
**Ataylor**: I know we went over, you know, going back to PSRs.
**Ataylor**: I mean, that knowing how to look at them and knowing how to cross check the information that goes with them, it allows you to help people know they got a problem when they don't think they got a problem, because that's going to happen.
**Bclymer**: I mean.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: The organizational part is, you know, I mean, like, it's.
**Bclymer**: You know, I.
**Bclymer**: Going back to that specific job, like, I.
**Bclymer**: I got.
**Bclymer**: I couldn't even, like, what the are we building?
**Bclymer**: Like, because nothing is organized.
**Bclymer**: The right drawings aren't in there.
**Bclymer**: I have no fucking idea.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: What is what.
**Bclymer**: The drawings on site are not what's built.
**Bclymer**: It's like, what is going on here.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: You know, which is why we paid Crate to build their building.
**Bclymer**: You know, like, I mean, that's the.
**Bclymer**: You know, that's the biggest thing.
**Bclymer**: It's like.
**Bclymer**: Like, it's.
**Bclymer**: I.
**Bclymer**: You know, it's just like, if you think about it, like, that's like, the worst thing you can do is get to a point where you're literally paying them.
**Bclymer**: Like, that's what we did.
**Bclymer**: Like, hey, let me give you money for your building.
**Bclymer**: Like, that's exactly what we did.
**Bclymer**: It's.
**Bclymer**: I mean, like, that's a.
**Bclymer**: It's a.
**Bclymer**: You know, I know that you.
**Bclymer**: I mean, my reasoning was, because we weren't going to build the building if we.
**Bclymer**: Because they have the money.
**Bclymer**: Well, but the thing is, I mean, we had a plan submitted with costs and everything, and they were trying to get stuff down, so the numbers were in there.
**Bclymer**: Either the.
**Bclymer**: Either, like, and we.
**Bclymer**: From my understanding, you said, all right, well, we can save money if we just delete these and put it elsewhere or whatever that is.
**Bclymer**: But the drawings that were submitted that we had numbers on, like, that was in the budget, like, that was there.
**Bclymer**: Like, we were gonna make 5% or whatever that was on the job based off of that.
**Bclymer**: Instead, you know, we changed it.
**Bclymer**: It ended up costing us, you know, 15, 20 grand lost.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: You know, so, I mean, we.
**Bclymer**: Not only.
**Bclymer**: We didn't make anything, we lost money on the job.
**Bclymer**: Like, literally, when I was going through the audit, I had to explain this to them because they were like, I don't understand.
**Bclymer**: How does that happen?
**Bclymer**: Like.
**Bclymer**: And they're like, well, is he gone?
**Bclymer**: Is he fired?
**Bclymer**: Like, And I'm like, no, he's still here.
**Bclymer**: Like, I fucking.
**Bclymer**: Literally.
**Bclymer**: I mean, like, that's how big of a thing it is.
**Bclymer**: And so, you know, I know that you think, like, you got to be like, oh, I'm not vp and I'm not this and I'm not that, but I'm like, you know what?
**Bclymer**: Like, the fact that you're not fired should tell you a lot, because that's how highly I think of you.
**Bclymer**: If anybody else did this, they would have been gone.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Like.
**Bclymer**: And so, like, you have to take that into account is like, that's how much I see in you.
**Bclymer**: The fact that I'm like, all right, I'm gonna take this and say, all right, this is a great learning experience for him, and he's going to.
**Bclymer**: To get better and, you know, pay dividends down the road.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I mean, I have no doubt it'll pay dividends for you.
**Bclymer**: So I.
**Bclymer**: You know, I wasn't.
**Bclymer**: I know my reasoning, why I did it.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Why I Did the things.
**Bclymer**: I don't have any doubt.
**Bclymer**: It came.
**Bclymer**: It came to a head when we had to.
**Bclymer**: We had to get it done.
**Bclymer**: If we would have two weeks to figure it out, it probably would have been a little different.
**Bclymer**: Like, the shutters weren't up.
**Bclymer**: So you mean it was like, well, there's no shutters here.
**Bclymer**: I was like, yeah, you're not wrong.
**Bclymer**: You know, and then submit for the stone.
**Bclymer**: We could have figured out the stone eight weeks prior.
**Bclymer**: The thing is, so, again, I know that none of this is done about malice.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Like, it was.
**Bclymer**: It was a mistake.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Like, in the mistakes that you made.
**Bclymer**: Just like, whenever we told you early on, dude, you need to press these guys, you need to be urgent early, because I'm telling you, things are gonna happen, which they did.
**Bclymer**: The water, all these things that, like, piled up, and then next thing you know, we're right.
**Bclymer**: Like, that's exactly what we talk about.
**Bclymer**: And the reason we say that is because we've both done it before.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: You know, we've been 26 and, you know, made mistakes, and we've seen mistakes happen.
**Bclymer**: Like, and that's the experience part.
**Bclymer**: Like, you talk about being a project executive, like, knowing that stuff.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Like, and that's.
**Bclymer**: That's where you have to.
**Bclymer**: To get to a point.
**Bclymer**: Like, as we build these bigger buildings, like, it's got to be done, you know, by the book.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And that's something I'm really trying to focus on.
**Bclymer**: And I know they're for these little jobs even just to be above and beyond with submittals and all that stuff, and they start ramping up.
**Ataylor**: So, like.
**Bclymer**: I know.
**Bclymer**: I know I am.
**Bclymer**: Shit.
**Ataylor**: The biggest point, aj is I know we didn't have.
**Ataylor**: You were running that as the PM of the job, and we didn't have a senior PM or project exec that was.
**Ataylor**: That was keeping an eye on what you were doing or what the job was doing.
**Ataylor**: That's what we have to have, is when we got all this work, we got to have someone that is actually checking what that PM is doing on that job.
**Ataylor**: Because if that would have been in.
**Ataylor**: It's my fault.
**Ataylor**: I could have been doing a better job of checking on it all the time.
**Ataylor**: But then, like, you got someone that's actually looking at the big picture and saying, like, what are you doing?
**Ataylor**: Like, I don't see any of your submittals, and what do you change the stone and you.
**Ataylor**: You don't have shutters bought and you change the windows.
**Ataylor**: And so that's what the second set of eyes we need to be, you know, someone else has to be looking at each job because if it's only the people running the job, you.
**Ataylor**: You get tunnel vision.
**Ataylor**: Or you, you know, you just.
**Ataylor**: You don't think of certain things that protect the company from someone taking that job down.
**Ataylor**: That's just one person or a team that's on there.
**Ataylor**: So, like now you got this experience from that job going south, but now you would know what to look at when a job comes up, that you're just looking at what the people are managing.
**Ataylor**: And that's what you have to demonstrate is, you know, all the jobs that are under your watch, whether it's you doing it or someone else, that all these things are taken care of.
**Ataylor**: You know, Smittles, subcontracts.
**Ataylor**: Like all those things are done and out the door early.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I mean, I don't think we.
**Bclymer**: I harp, I mention it in the next, you know, the next question.
**Bclymer**: I know it doesn't seem like it, but I really do, especially after that, like, I understand it's not my money at the end of, you know, it's.
**Bclymer**: It's Brandon's money.
**Bclymer**: It's your money as a partner, Jesse, at the end of the day.
**Bclymer**: And it's like, it's embarrassing and it definitely won't happen again.
**Bclymer**: So, like, I appreciate the space to learn the hard way.
**Bclymer**: So, I mean, we got some cool jobs in the pipeline because of it.
**Bclymer**: Because they.
**Bclymer**: They do sing our praises.
**Bclymer**: They do.
**Bclymer**: They do like us a lot.
**Bclymer**: Crate does.
**Bclymer**: And.
**Bclymer**: And so that's the only thing that I.
**Bclymer**: It helped me sleep at night there for a while.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I mean, like.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, that's like me going in there.
**Bclymer**: Like the, the morning that you called me, we had the issue of not passing.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: That's exactly why I did what I did and said, all right, let me call the city and go give them cash.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: You know, to get this thing over the.
**Bclymer**: Because again, our reputation.
**Bclymer**: We're going to keep our promise.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: It would have been a nightmare.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Had I not done that.
**Bclymer**: And then there's no way it would have got done.
**Bclymer**: And then they would not be seeing how prices.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: And just take, you know, thinking of that, too.
**Ataylor**: Every job we take, every job, you turn numbers in or you watch people turn numbers in.
**Ataylor**: Need to take an extra look at, like, is this really helping us out?
**Ataylor**: Are we covered?
**Ataylor**: Is it going to make us money?
**Ataylor**: Are we doing this for nothing?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: You got to think about, like, margin.
**Bclymer**: Like.
**Bclymer**: Like, for instance, that.
**Bclymer**: That Arkansas job, designer job.
**Bclymer**: Like, I marked that up a hundred percent.
**Bclymer**: A little bit more than a hundred percent.
**Bclymer**: You know, I think it cost us like, maybe with time calculated, 15 grand, right?
**Bclymer**: You think we charged them 50, right.
**Bclymer**: You know, like, and again, that's because I wouldn't do that for anybody.
**Bclymer**: But Zion has given us good projects where we make great margins.
**Bclymer**: You know, I mean, shit, LAKESHORE, we made 40%.
**Bclymer**: You know, all these ASR systems will make 30 to 50.
**Bclymer**: Like, you know, but taking like small jobs where we have no margin in it, like, is more of a risk, you know, like, you know, you've gotta, you've gotta look at that.
**Bclymer**: Like, I understand.
**Bclymer**: Like, you know, oh, I want to get work and I want to, you know, build up my, you know.
**Bclymer**: Well, we were, yeah, we were puckered at the beginning, but we were also gung ho about getting our first round up.
**Bclymer**: So in hindsight I wish that we would have been like, there's no way we can do like, we.
**Bclymer**: I'm not talking about Crate, I'm talking about just in general, like any of the other ti's or stuff that you look at, right?
**Bclymer**: You're like, like, oh, like taking time to go do this remodel for a office.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Like, I get it.
**Bclymer**: Like all those brokers and stuff, like, you know, trying to get that stuff and they don't, they don't have, you know, whatever.
**Bclymer**: Like, you know, it's a, it's a tough game.
**Bclymer**: You're doing what everybody else is doing.
**Bclymer**: That's why I was like, alright, like, if you took the time, right, and you just landed one client in six months, that is a real job compared to the time, you know, all these little things with whatever broker.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, like, you would, you would not only make more money, you'd be happier.
**Bclymer**: Like, and it puts you in a different category.
**Bclymer**: That's why I always talk about being a sniper.
**Bclymer**: You know, don't go after the Jeff Humphreys of the world, right?
**Bclymer**: Not worth our time.
**Bclymer**: No, not at all.
**Bclymer**: Like, we don't, you know, they don't see the value that we bring.
**Bclymer**: Like, that's why, like, you will get the collective guys like ibex.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I say collective, it's ibex.
**Bclymer**: Like, they like us because they see the value.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, right.
**Bclymer**: And Mike, when he first, when he first looked, when I first gave the proposal on the collective, he was like, what's your mark?
**Bclymer**: He's like, what's your market?
**Bclymer**: I said 10 plus insurance.
**Bclymer**: And B.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, he's like, yeah, I just let the site Sit there.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And now that is set.
**Bclymer**: Like, so, for instance, the hotel.
**Bclymer**: 10%.
**Bclymer**: That's $4 million.
**Bclymer**: Or, you know, Paradise Isles.
**Bclymer**: I'll do five because it's 1.2 billion.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: You know, but still, that's not half bad, right?
**Bclymer**: That's 50, $60 million in her pocket.
**Bclymer**: Some people aren't getting close to 5% on some of those jobs.
**Bclymer**: No, I mean, Leighton, you know What, Jim?
**Bclymer**: Say 600 million at the Amazon at two and a half.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, that's it.
**Ataylor**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Now, granted, Leighton, they make their money.
**Bclymer**: You know, their GCs are swollen as.
**Bclymer**: You know, their GCs are probably 20 of the job.
**Bclymer**: You know, so they'll make money other ways.
**Bclymer**: But my point is, like, if we can.
**Bclymer**: The higher margin we can make on work, the better it is, because if we do a billion dollars but we're at a 2% margin, the risk is out of this world.
**Bclymer**: I'd much rather do a half a billion dollars at a 12% margin or whatever that is.
**Bclymer**: That's what we got to look at.
**Bclymer**: Now, again, there's strategic things that we'll do to get our foot in the door.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: You know, but that's a.
**Bclymer**: Again, that's a business decision that we have to make.
**Bclymer**: But that should not.
**Bclymer**: Like, the standard should be, you know, if we're.
**Bclymer**: If it's a small job or whatever.
**Bclymer**: Like, if it's, you know, under a hundred thousand dollars, like, there better be a damn good reason that we're even going after it.
**Bclymer**: I agree.
**Bclymer**: But that's why, like, on that call with, you know, what's his name with the bank, I told him, I think I said, half a million and lower isn't really our forte.
**Bclymer**: It's not now, which is easy, you know, if you set the standard early, like you said, Makes all those conversations after the fact, like.
**Bclymer**: Like, Radial doesn't even balk when I send them.
**Bclymer**: Like, I break out the fee in the GCs because they're just like, that's how much it costs to use us.
**Bclymer**: Like.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And they're.
**Bclymer**: And that's what JP Was saying.
**Bclymer**: He's like, I tell these guys, like, especially for these things, I don't bid it out because you're gonna handle it, and I can.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Because, yeah, we probably.
**Bclymer**: Probably pay a lot more, but it doesn't matter.
**Bclymer**: I mean, not even a lot more.
**Bclymer**: For seven years, I've delivered for them, and, you know, in the first two or three, like, they bid me out and we win.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: You know, and that's.
**Bclymer**: That's the trust building.
**Bclymer**: Like I want to get to that.
**Bclymer**: Like that's why I'm like, you know, Siva, I understand.
**Bclymer**: Like right now they're bidding us out.
**Bclymer**: It's annoying because they said we need this tomorrow and then here's a budget number and now all of a sudden they want us to sharpen the pencil to, to go against other people.
**Bclymer**: But whatever.
**Ataylor**: Yep.
**Ataylor**: The next was what are you doing?
**Ataylor**: Well and your attitude has gotten better.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So I can expound.
**Bclymer**: I mean you got to think.
**Bclymer**: I just felt like as we grew, like I had to especially after the crate stuff.
**Bclymer**: Like I felt like I was just fighting to get back in your guys good graces.
**Bclymer**: So you know, bringing people on and wanting to, you know, for a lot.
**Bclymer**: For two years I was involved in everything and every decision and then realizing, you know, one, you don't know it all to, you know, Brandon's got a business to run, he's trying to grow it and three, you know, just leave no doubt and do the best that you can do.
**Bclymer**: And you know, it all fall into place, which I know that.
**Bclymer**: So it's just hard because it was, it was just you and me for so long.
**Bclymer**: Change is hard.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And so that's the biggest thing I think like, you know, especially in the last six months, I'm more excited about, you know, pumped Jesse that you're here to help and you know, able to be that more of a mentor and you know, help Brandon in a lot of things because I don't know, than anything.
**Bclymer**: So it's, it's exciting to see where we're going.
**Bclymer**: I just want to keep showing my worth and realizing that to you guys that you know, I don't want to be, I want to be an ops my whole life.
**Bclymer**: It's not what my personality is geared towards.
**Bclymer**: So I want to be in the room with you guys leading and bringing in work.
**Bclymer**: So I have an interest.
**Bclymer**: That's why I went and got my real estate license for the development stuff for the ibex stuff for all of that.
**Bclymer**: And I just gotta keep learning.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: But you also have to think too like, like I hate like all of 28 now.
**Bclymer**: I don't want to keep having to do half a million dollar Neiman jobs.
**Bclymer**: You know, I want to work on bringing in the big ones.
**Bclymer**: That's my goal and you know, hopefully you'll continue to give me and I'm so appreciative that freedom to be able to chase that because if I didn't have it, I, you know, find somewhere else which would be a hard place to find.
**Bclymer**: But I've been fortunate enough to be at small companies, my last three companies, where I was able to learn, you know, directly under the owners.
**Bclymer**: And so that's more experience than most 28 year olds get.
**Bclymer**: And I realize that.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: And you have to think, too.
**Bclymer**: Like, you talk about being in these different meetings and whatnot.
**Bclymer**: Like, you know, I messing.
**Bclymer**: Jesse's not in every single meeting with me.
**Bclymer**: I just want to learn, like, how to navigate the conversations because I know I have the talk to do it.
**Bclymer**: So that's it.
**Bclymer**: And you are in this.
**Bclymer**: You know, you're in the ones that you can be in.
**Ataylor**: Right?
**Bclymer**: But like, and I record every meeting, so it's not like you can't get on there and fucking watch it, right?
**Bclymer**: Record it or see exactly how to do it, but you can't sit here and get upset because you're not in every single meeting.
**Bclymer**: That's a waste of time, waste of energy.
**Bclymer**: I know.
**Bclymer**: I'm just saying that's how it was for two and a half years.
**Bclymer**: And I loved.
**Bclymer**: I soaked it in.
**Bclymer**: I love learning.
**Bclymer**: I love being involved in bringing in the work.
**Bclymer**: And then obviously hired Jesse knows 10 times more than me.
**Bclymer**: And these other end, it's like, had to do less of that.
**Bclymer**: And that's.
**Bclymer**: It's a change.
**Bclymer**: So that's part of it.
**Bclymer**: That's why I think of all the things I'm.
**Bclymer**: I'm realizing that and I'm just waking up trying to produce.
**Ataylor**: AJ the worst thing we could do is put you in everything and on everything, and then you don't manage anything well.
**Ataylor**: And that is part of our strategy is we're not gonna, you know, you always say, I got time, I got time.
**Ataylor**: But, like, if you said that every time we dump something else on you, then, you know, something's gonna struggle or something's gonna just fall behind.
**Ataylor**: So that's why, you know, we want to make sure, like, you always.
**Ataylor**: You need to be just level with.
**Ataylor**: This is like, no, I am maxed out.
**Ataylor**: I can't take anything more.
**Ataylor**: Because, like, right now you say that, and I tried to put more on you and more on you, and, like, you got to be open with us.
**Ataylor**: And like, okay, this is about all I can handle right now.
**Ataylor**: That's not a knock on anybody.
**Ataylor**: But the people that always say yes, and then they fall behind, Then they just look bad.
**Ataylor**: So, you know.
**Bclymer**: You guys know where I want to be in five years.
**Bclymer**: So just whatever that timeline is, that's what I'm that's what I'm working towards.
**Bclymer**: So that, that helps to know, you know, I need to grow and be better at where I'm at.
**Bclymer**: But I'm going to always be wanting more.
**Bclymer**: This is how I'm built.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I mean, there's, there's no, like, obviously we all want more.
**Bclymer**: I want more.
**Bclymer**: Jesse wants whatever he wants more.
**Bclymer**: Like, but it's also like, you know, I would love to get, you know, more work, but I'm also cognizant of if I went out there and just said, all right, I'm gonna pound the pavement and fucking try to bring in, you know, more work right now.
**Bclymer**: Like, we don't have the capacity to run it, you know, at this juncture in time.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Like, so again, we're getting to that point now.
**Bclymer**: Like, like right now I'm saying, like, we feel like maybe it's just up in Indy where we got, you know, a bunch of guys everywhere, but looking in the future, like we were talking about yesterday, we're gonna need work for guys.
**Bclymer**: So it's like it's just been doing this, I feel like, for so long.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I mean, yes.
**Bclymer**: And that's, trust me, that's.
**Bclymer**: It sucks as things get delayed and whatnot.
**Bclymer**: But the whole point of that is.
**Ataylor**: Like, well, that's what the, the duration of these jobs we're looking at getting now, like George is going to be a year and a half, you know, Unique close.
**Ataylor**: A year long project.
**Ataylor**: So those are the ones we land.
**Ataylor**: That, that evens your company out because now you've got stuff that's always filling in all the gaps.
**Ataylor**: Whereas, you know, that's why I was doing that schedule today.
**Ataylor**: You know, these six month projects, they stop and start.
**Ataylor**: That's where you got to really either have a, you know, because if we didn't have all the guys we had right now, we'd be in a world of hurt because we, you know, we don't have enough coverage.
**Ataylor**: But you know, when you get the bigger, longer jobs and when it's slow, you can send the guys at least to those jobs instead of, you know, now currently, when jobs are done until something starts, they're sitting around helping out really not being as productive as what they're being paid for.
**Ataylor**: So that'll change.
**Bclymer**: I didn't know Unique was a year long.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I mean, should it be a year long?
**Bclymer**: It's just because the racking is taking so long to install.
**Bclymer**: It's just.
**Bclymer**: No, I mean, you could do it quicker, but your exotech has one crew on it.
**Bclymer**: There's not so much we can do.
**Bclymer**: All right, where can you.
**Ataylor**: Where can you improve communication with clients?
**Ataylor**: That is good.
**Ataylor**: You know, just also, like today, I mean, Brandon are probably scatterbrained all day because we do it, but we check our mail, and when we see things like that email from the structural and, you know, the architect for Avon, like, you gotta at least check in that stuff, because if it sits there for a day or two and the people working under you don't really understand what they should be doing, then they can lead that down the wrong path and take time and money.
**Ataylor**: So I.
**Ataylor**: I would make sure.
**Ataylor**: If you're not.
**Ataylor**: You're making sure you get through your email every day a couple times, and make sure you just briefly hit them, and if you need to go back to it later, mark it on red or something.
**Ataylor**: But, like, that's how you can prevent a lot of issues from spiraling.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I have a lot to learn.
**Bclymer**: I mean, especially stepping more into a management role.
**Bclymer**: Like, I've never had an apm, like, tell.
**Bclymer**: You know what I mean?
**Bclymer**: I've never had that.
**Bclymer**: I've had, you know, superintendents and maybe a project engineer or two, but so it's new to me.
**Bclymer**: So learning how to.
**Bclymer**: Which I know you struggle with, right?
**Bclymer**: And I say, you're, like, learning how to trust, like, that Kev is gonna call the guy about the permit.
**Bclymer**: You know what I mean?
**Bclymer**: It's like I'm learning it firsthand.
**Bclymer**: I like it.
**Bclymer**: It's.
**Bclymer**: It's.
**Bclymer**: But it takes that.
**Bclymer**: Verify experience.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I mean.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I can't tell you, like.
**Bclymer**: Cause I know I could do it quicker.
**Bclymer**: Like, I was about to just stop by Avon and just say, hey, what do I have to do for this permit?
**Bclymer**: And I was like, you know, Kevin was gonna call.
**Bclymer**: He said he would.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, it is.
**Bclymer**: It's constantly falling up.
**Bclymer**: But if you saw me just do good.
**Bclymer**: Where the fuck's that masonry at?
**Bclymer**: Like, yeah, you know, like, I always say, like, you know, like, we're paid on a result thing.
**Bclymer**: And it's like, if I got to come, like, come down and, like, constantly ask questions, like, that's annoying.
**Bclymer**: Like, I.
**Bclymer**: You know, I'll talk about Nick, right?
**Bclymer**: Like, so I hardly ever check in with Nick, because every time I do, he's on it, right?
**Bclymer**: And that's.
**Bclymer**: That's great.
**Bclymer**: I don't have to worry about it.
**Bclymer**: That's.
**Bclymer**: I can.
**Bclymer**: I can.
**Bclymer**: I know I can throw good little projects at him, you know, and he can get it taken Care of and the clients happy.
**Bclymer**: And then I'll.
**Bclymer**: I can do the customer relation.
**Bclymer**: He's making sure shit's getting done.
**Bclymer**: That's great.
**Bclymer**: Right, right.
**Bclymer**: Like, I want that with, you know, with you and Glenn and everybody else, right?
**Bclymer**: Like, you know, I don't like to have to be constantly thinking for everybody.
**Bclymer**: Like, and so that's a.
**Bclymer**: That's a big thing.
**Bclymer**: Like, if you're gonna have people underneath you, you've gotta set the standard, right?
**Bclymer**: For sure.
**Bclymer**: Like, that's like, you know, talk about, like, man, like, you know, cart is so demanding and radio so demanding and all this stuff.
**Bclymer**: And it's like, you know, they.
**Bclymer**: They just like you.
**Bclymer**: It's like.
**Bclymer**: Well, the reason is, is because I was very diligent and still am about being attentive to their needs.
**Bclymer**: And.
**Bclymer**: And that's why we get $3 million at work, no questions asked, thrown at us to go do, right?
**Bclymer**: You know, I mean, that's 25% margin.
**Bclymer**: Exactly.
**Bclymer**: Like, that's the thing.
**Bclymer**: Like, that's what.
**Bclymer**: Like that's what we have to, you know, that's what we have to do.
**Bclymer**: And so, you know, you've got to get better at that.
**Bclymer**: You know, one thing, like, for me, like, working at.
**Bclymer**: Where can you improve?
**Bclymer**: Like, stop bitching.
**Bclymer**: That is like, if you can't, you can't, like, sit here and think about what I don't have, because it's just going to breed negative emotions all the time.
**Bclymer**: Like, you talk about this thing with.
**Bclymer**: Oh, well, we wouldn't have collect if it wasn't for me, right?
**Bclymer**: And like, when I think about that, I'm like, okay, like, where does that end?
**Bclymer**: At what point does that end?
**Bclymer**: Like, because, okay, we got Crate.
**Bclymer**: Megan talked to Katie.
**Bclymer**: Katie called me.
**Bclymer**: Like, you know, we have a meet.
**Bclymer**: All right, so then that means, like, I meet Paul, who through ibex, right?
**Bclymer**: And if Paul introduces me to somebody else, right Then, okay, well, that wouldn't happen if it wasn't for Craig.
**Bclymer**: Like, how far down the line does it go?
**Bclymer**: Because we think about like, this happened because of this.
**Bclymer**: Well, shit, I mean, had I never worked for Jesse a decade ago or whatever, we wouldn't be here, you know.
**Bclymer**: So, I mean, like, how far down do you expect something to go?
**Bclymer**: Like, that's a real question.
**Bclymer**: Because I want to crush this thing that you have, saying, like, oh, that's mine.
**Bclymer**: I should be, you know, running that.
**Bclymer**: Like, I don't.
**Bclymer**: We don't need to talk.
**Bclymer**: Talk about that right now.
**Ataylor**: Now that you mention it, I would like A finder's fee on every job you've done since you've been in existence.
**Ataylor**: Now that you put it like that.
**Bclymer**: It'S more of a.
**Bclymer**: I don't want to talk about it right now.
**Bclymer**: And that's not the place.
**Bclymer**: I'm at a good place for it, Brandon, because you do sometimes, like, you're a confident guy, and you.
**Bclymer**: A lot of time, you're like, well, I did this and I did that, and I did that.
**Bclymer**: I'm like, well, hey, man, there's been a lot of people that have helped you get here, and I feel the love from you.
**Bclymer**: So I'm not saying no.
**Bclymer**: But to say that we didn't get Collective from Crate, that's crazy, because you would have if I hadn't made that call.
**Bclymer**: If, If Liz hadn't had said, aj, hey, Meg's doing this, and I hadn't made that call.
**Bclymer**: Like, I, I, I know you helped a lot, but I sold a lot of that job for Crate.
**Bclymer**: I did now turned out to be an absolute shit show.
**Bclymer**: So that's why I'm done.
**Bclymer**: Like, I don't want to talk about anymore, but we would not have, like, I.
**Bclymer**: Because she's saying our praises with our service.
**Bclymer**: Because you stepped in.
**Bclymer**: Because the whole time I've done nothing but bend over backward and work.
**Bclymer**: I work nine Saturday and Sundays in a row to get them in on that January day.
**Bclymer**: I put myself in that situation because I didn't push it back.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: So that's why I don't want to talk like, it's fine.
**Bclymer**: I know.
**Bclymer**: I know my worth.
**Bclymer**: I know where, like, to not sit, to say that I have nothing to do with it, you know, that's more where I'm like, well, that's kind of shitty.
**Bclymer**: Well, this is like this thing.
**Bclymer**: We were growing this together for the longest time until Jesse joined us in June, it was just you and me.
**Bclymer**: Well, so this thing, like, just, it festers.
**Bclymer**: And what I want to do is, like, kill the monster when it's small and try to figure out, like, it's what it is, because it's still like, Like, I'm not saying that I'm not grateful for you doing the best you could and caring about the client.
**Bclymer**: Getting our first ground up.
**Bclymer**: Absolutely, yes.
**Bclymer**: Very grateful for that.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Like, absolutely.
**Bclymer**: Like, but I also, like, need you to understand, like, just like you said, it takes a team.
**Bclymer**: Like, you know, it's not like you, you know, Katie called us, and it's like, here you go.
**Bclymer**: Like, that's not how that Worked.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Like, just like anybody else who recommends us because they've worked with us.
**Bclymer**: Like, that's like, for instance, GPC Harrisburg.
**Bclymer**: Like, they were recommended to us because of working with high tech.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Oh, these are the guys that, you know, do it well.
**Bclymer**: Like, that's going to happen organically because we do good work.
**Bclymer**: Like, that's part of it.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Hey, I'm.
**Bclymer**: I'm good.
**Bclymer**: We're good.
**Bclymer**: I'm not.
**Bclymer**: I get it.
**Bclymer**: So it's not festering anymore.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: I would like a chance to work on more of that stuff, but that's just because I want the experience.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And.
**Bclymer**: And there is.
**Bclymer**: So it's more of a.
**Bclymer**: It's more.
**Bclymer**: I'm at the point with.
**Bclymer**: In my life having this baby.
**Bclymer**: Like, Like, I'm.
**Bclymer**: It's more of a motivation for me to bring in my own.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I mean, that's all it is.
**Bclymer**: And you will, like, again, you will, like.
**Bclymer**: I know.
**Bclymer**: It's also like, first of all, we don't have anything else, really.
**Bclymer**: Like, the hotel just got released.
**Bclymer**: I don't even have design pricing back to work on it.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: And not only that, that's in fucking Georgia now.
**Bclymer**: There's one project that I brought up to Mike the other this week that is here in Indy that he's very interested in.
**Bclymer**: Like, that would be a great one for you.
**Bclymer**: It's a fucking golf course that we would demo anyway, so you could go out there and fuck around on acting like a st.
**Bclymer**: I.
**Bclymer**: I'm not.
**Bclymer**: Dude.
**Bclymer**: I'm at a good place with it, granted.
**Bclymer**: I'm super thankful.
**Bclymer**: Like, I.
**Bclymer**: I promise you.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: It's.
**Bclymer**: It's.
**Bclymer**: It's nipped in the bud.
**Bclymer**: Promise.
**Bclymer**: I think a lot of it came to you from feeling so bad about Crate.
**Bclymer**: Trying to make up for it.
**Bclymer**: I mean, that's where a lot of it comes.
**Bclymer**: That makes sense.
**Bclymer**: So it's.
**Bclymer**: It's good, man.
**Bclymer**: I'm excited.
**Bclymer**: I'm excited.
**Bclymer**: So we shouldn't have to talk about it anymore.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: But no, when I'm asking about these jobs, it comes from a place of, like, wanting just to help.
**Bclymer**: I get it.
**Bclymer**: And so that's.
**Bclymer**: And that's.
**Bclymer**: I got a lot of maturity to do in a lot of.
**Bclymer**: In a lot of ways.
**Bclymer**: That's probably one of them.
**Bclymer**: But it's also like, it's probably never going to change.
**Bclymer**: Just be patient with me.
**Bclymer**: And I appreciate it.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: What do you like about your manager or that your manager does you set the work tone or set the tone for work ethic that is.
**Bclymer**: Well, I.
**Bclymer**: I was thinking of both of you in this, so I know which one.
**Bclymer**: So there's no one that works harder than you guys.
**Bclymer**: And that's something that I say unmatched because I.
**Bclymer**: I know I work hard and I put in a lot of hours, like a lot of us do, but you guys are always putting in more, so.
**Bclymer**: Well, it's not about the hours, right?
**Bclymer**: Like, it's.
**Bclymer**: It's.
**Bclymer**: It's what's getting done.
**Bclymer**: You can, you know, you can run on all day and not go anywhere.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Like, you're expelling energy, but it's not any good.
**Bclymer**: It's all.
**Bclymer**: It's about efficiencies, especially as you grow, like, you have to become more and more efficient.
**Bclymer**: That's part of the experience standpoint, right?
**Bclymer**: That's part of, like, you know, me or Jesse.
**Bclymer**: Like, you know, we've seen so many different projects and drawings and stuff.
**Bclymer**: We can look at a drawing for five minutes and then walk around and be like, wait a minute.
**Bclymer**: And like, look on site and understand and see stuff.
**Bclymer**: Like, that's experience.
**Bclymer**: Like, that's just.
**Bclymer**: Again, that's hours and hours of studying drawings and seeing countless, countless iterations of them.
**Bclymer**: Like, that's.
**Bclymer**: That's why, like, again, back when we were, you know.
**Bclymer**: Well, probably not him, because he's so funny old.
**Bclymer**: Back when I was, you know, working for, you know, you know, I was digging into those drawings all the time, constantly.
**Bclymer**: Always had my iPad out, like, looking at stuff like reading spec books, just trying to learn as much as possible.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So that now, you know, whatever decade or so later, like, I.
**Bclymer**: Well versed.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: So you want more trust.
**Bclymer**: So I didn't know I thought of a better word for this.
**Bclymer**: I think it was two nights ago and I was thinking of this and I forgot what it was.
**Bclymer**: So trust isn't the right word.
**Bclymer**: I think it's more of what we talked about, and I'm learning firsthand now how tough that is of, like, maybe micromanaging.
**Bclymer**: I don't know what the right word is, but that's.
**Ataylor**: It's all up to you, aj.
**Ataylor**: Like, we give you these jobs now, so Avon and Martinsville, now you're managing people, managing work.
**Ataylor**: And when we never hear a peep from the owner, or we're not saying, why isn't someone responding to their question, or why are they texting me?
**Ataylor**: Because they're not getting info.
**Ataylor**: Like, that's how you get trust.
**Ataylor**: Because, you know, if it's all being handled for a year, and then a year later, some client texts us.
**Ataylor**: We're like, well, he don't let that happen.
**Ataylor**: So let me figure out what the problem is.
**Ataylor**: And we're not going to be like, well, God damn, now I gotta get involved in this again.
**Ataylor**: So.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I get it.
**Bclymer**: I.
**Bclymer**: I totally get that.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: But I had to put something down.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I don't like being micromanaged, and I think I'm doing a good job.
**Bclymer**: I just need you guys to be frank when it's like, aj, you're not doing a good job.
**Bclymer**: Like, you did it with me with Cart, with the design back in February.
**Bclymer**: Like, hey, man, reply.
**Bclymer**: I was like, you're right.
**Bclymer**: All right, so radio is a perfect opportunity to prove that.
**Bclymer**: Well, like, it's.
**Bclymer**: And it's the little things, right?
**Bclymer**: Like, for instance, like, you know, we look at.
**Bclymer**: Like, how many times are you say, I'll have this and it's not done?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, right.
**Bclymer**: Like churchyard.
**Bclymer**: That hasn't come through.
**Bclymer**: Like, I had to the other day.
**Bclymer**: I was like, where are the contracts and submittals for applied?
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Why are those not in there?
**Bclymer**: Like, they were supposed to already be done.
**Bclymer**: Like.
**Bclymer**: And so, like, I look at these little things, and then I also go back to the thing of where you're constantly asking for more stuff, and I'm like, well, fuck, man.
**Bclymer**: Like, why don't you get these things done?
**Bclymer**: You know, And.
**Bclymer**: And then.
**Bclymer**: Then you can definitely do it.
**Bclymer**: But, like, when you tell me, like, I need more, and then I look at the stuff that should be done and it's not done, I'm like, why am I giving you more?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I mean, I hear you.
**Bclymer**: I'm not gonna.
**Bclymer**: Church yards.
**Bclymer**: Like, I'll get it done.
**Bclymer**: But that was.
**Bclymer**: I hopped in there, you know, early last week after we hired Andre.
**Bclymer**: So I.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, but in our.
**Bclymer**: In our meeting on Monday, right, You said, I'll have it done tomorrow, you know?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: That's the kind of thing where it's like, you know, I'm not.
**Bclymer**: I'm not.
**Bclymer**: I'm.
**Bclymer**: I need to be better about committing the days, that's for sure.
**Bclymer**: You got to deliver, and you have to be.
**Bclymer**: Unless I know I'm going to deliver, which I'm not going to do that anymore.
**Bclymer**: But I.
**Bclymer**: I think I have a pulse on when things need to get done.
**Bclymer**: And I'm trying to be better about, like.
**Bclymer**: Like yesterday, JP was like, will you give me that breakdown?
**Bclymer**: And I was like, I will.
**Bclymer**: But I didn't say, I'll have it to you by the End of the day.
**Bclymer**: Because, like, I may not have it to him by the end of the day.
**Bclymer**: So I'm trying to get a lot better at that.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I mean, you know, setting expectations and stuff.
**Bclymer**: Because that's what everybody reports, right?
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: All the way up the chain.
**Bclymer**: Like, that's, that's what every, all these.
**Bclymer**: Everybody reports to somebody and they have to tell their boss, well, it's going to be done by this day.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Like, because they're basing it off of what we said.
**Bclymer**: Just like everybody says that.
**Bclymer**: Like, that's why I'm a big trust but verify guy, because people say things and then if you just take what they say and then you miss it, you look like a dumbass.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: It kills trust, not only with your superiors, but with clients, things like that.
**Bclymer**: You know, Like I, you know, I put on here, like the book Extreme Ownership.
**Bclymer**: Like, there's a.
**Bclymer**: I can't remember what chapter is maybe four or something like that.
**Bclymer**: Talks about leading up the chain of command.
**Bclymer**: Like, and again, if you haven't read it, read that.
**Bclymer**: Because he's like his, you know, one of his.
**Bclymer**: One of his two years, whatever, was like, man, these guys never let us go on missions, you know, talking about his command.
**Bclymer**: He's like, well, we just have to over deliver and build that trust.
**Bclymer**: And so initially it was all these little details, very blah, blah, until they built that trust.
**Bclymer**: And once they built that trust, it's like they could submit for any mission and it would be approved.
**Bclymer**: It's the same thing here.
**Bclymer**: Like, you've got to do all those little things and build that trust.
**Bclymer**: And then it's like, all right, yeah, he's got it.
**Bclymer**: And we.
**Bclymer**: I don't have to worry.
**Bclymer**: I don't have to check in.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, it's the same thing with, with you.
**Bclymer**: Like, with, with Kevin.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Like, you know, yesterday when we were on that call with Uniqlo, like, and Kevin was looking, the right drawings were in the file or something like that.
**Bclymer**: Like, I was about to be irate because I was gonna be like, what the fuck, man?
**Bclymer**: Like, you can't, you can't have an organized drawing file.
**Bclymer**: Like, how hard is that?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, like, and that's little things like that that you just gotta do the right way.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So I go back to the Leave no doubt.
**Bclymer**: And that's my goal in the next coming months, get through the summer.
**Bclymer**: Leave no doubt.
**Bclymer**: And that's what I tell other guys.
**Bclymer**: That's what my, my own father's always told me.
**Bclymer**: And it's the truth.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Ataylor**: All right, where do you want to be in five years?
**Bclymer**: Oh this, this list could have gone.
**Bclymer**: I could have had 10 items on.
**Ataylor**: Okay, I don't see golfing anywhere on here.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, golf is not on there.
**Bclymer**: House on a golf course.
**Bclymer**: I mean this all has to do with work so.
**Ataylor**: Well, I don't not in charge of the ownership but you know, running the indie office managing accountants and all the other folks in the that are working under you in this office, ground up development experience.
**Ataylor**: Like all those things can be had for sure in five years.
**Ataylor**: And again that's where you, you know, you get the trust of the people you're working with.
**Ataylor**: And that'll come.
**Ataylor**: I mean when I'm thinking like when I ran a job as either superintendent or the project manager, like I never like if my senior PM was coming to visit, he was just coming to have a beer and go to lunch.
**Ataylor**: Like I never had someone come to help really help with the job at all.
**Ataylor**: And I was the one that was get sent to the jobs that were up because the people weren't doing it right and then I'd have to straighten it out.
**Ataylor**: So like that when you become that person is like a detriment to me because maybe that's why they never wanted to promote me because they liked having their fix it guy just run around and do for him.
**Ataylor**: But that's the person like you get to be that person because that.
**Ataylor**: That make me happier than anything.
**Ataylor**: My check in was.
**Ataylor**: Let's go have a beer and grab lunch.
**Ataylor**: You know, is everything good on the job?
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: You can tell it when you're not having problems with subs and the owner's happy.
**Ataylor**: Like there's really, you know, the people managing for you have got things under control.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I mean the.
**Bclymer**: You know what I would say like, you know and you mentioned up here about like what does your manager do?
**Bclymer**: Well right.
**Bclymer**: Like to do these things.
**Bclymer**: Think about like all right, well what.
**Bclymer**: What did these guys do that I need to do?
**Bclymer**: Like you talk about you know, unmatched work ethic.
**Bclymer**: You know, it's like one thing I can, I can tell you is again not saying that you don't have valid reasons, but you are gone more than anybody else consistently for whatever it may be.
**Bclymer**: Like literally like and I into to look at it, I actually started to record it.
**Bclymer**: Like I actually put together.
**Bclymer**: Sure I fucking see it.
**Bclymer**: I tracked it for like I think a month.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: To see what it was that you're.
**Bclymer**: You're gone time and I can't remember that it was like 20%, you know, of the days you had left for something, you know, out of a month or something like that.
**Bclymer**: Like, but I mean, do you.
**Bclymer**: I mean, you have to realize that, right?
**Bclymer**: Like, I mean, I.
**Bclymer**: I would love to see the log.
**Bclymer**: I mean, I know.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I enjoy that freedom.
**Bclymer**: Now.
**Bclymer**: I also know that if I have to get something done, like, you know, I'm on my computer nightly, I'm waking up early if I need to, like, it gets.
**Bclymer**: It gets done.
**Bclymer**: I'm here early when I need to be.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, it gets, like, forget the, like, any of that.
**Bclymer**: Right?
**Bclymer**: Like, what I'm talking about is, like, you again, leading by example.
**Bclymer**: Like, one of the biggest things that you.
**Bclymer**: You compliment him and I honor is work ethic, indeed, by example.
**Bclymer**: Like, that's 100% what we did.
**Bclymer**: Like, I don't want to be here first in, last out, like, every fucking day.
**Bclymer**: Like.
**Bclymer**: Like, you have to be like, I've done.
**Bclymer**: But I.
**Bclymer**: I have to set the tone, you know, to do it.
**Bclymer**: Like now.
**Bclymer**: Like, my goal is that it gets to a point where, you know, this office, the other offices are running and there's somebody else setting that tone, that expectation, you know.
**Bclymer**: But if I'm not In here at 7, nobody is.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: And I'm not saying that's forever, but, I mean, you know, I've been doing it for 15 years.
**Bclymer**: I want to keep doing it.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I mean, I.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, but, like, that's.
**Bclymer**: That's the thing.
**Bclymer**: Like, I get it that, like, I think it's.
**Bclymer**: It's crazy that you guys think that.
**Bclymer**: Like, it just.
**Bclymer**: If you're in at 6:45 and leave at 5, like, you can be there, but a lot of time, like, yeah, we can agree to disagree on that, I think, because I could show up at 6:45 every day, beat you in and leave.
**Bclymer**: And that, yeah, that's gonna set a tone, but you also have to get shit done.
**Bclymer**: Like, if you.
**Bclymer**: Like when guys come, like, it's like 4 o' clock and they're leaving.
**Bclymer**: I'm like, you got everything done.
**Bclymer**: Like, if they do, then they should be allowed to go.
**Bclymer**: And they are.
**Bclymer**: There's never once when I know, sit here.
**Bclymer**: Now, what typically is shit's not done.
**Bclymer**: I can hear you there.
**Bclymer**: I hear you there.
**Bclymer**: Like, like, by all means, I.
**Bclymer**: I'll think of one.
**Bclymer**: One time particular.
**Bclymer**: I was working for Jesse.
**Bclymer**: I'd been working for him for, I don't know, two months maybe or a month or something like, that wasn't that long.
**Bclymer**: It was Friday Night, it was six something.
**Bclymer**: We were the only two in the office, per usual.
**Bclymer**: And you know, I was kind of sitting there like, because we shared an office, you know, just kind of like.
**Bclymer**: And he could tell I was just, you know, not doing anything right.
**Bclymer**: And he's like, is this change?
**Bclymer**: We're done?
**Bclymer**: I said, yeah, your tactic box, like, box is like a thing that we had.
**Bclymer**: Like, it's like, he's like, is this done?
**Bclymer**: It's like, yeah, your tactic box ready for your room?
**Bclymer**: Is this done?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, tactic box ready for you, like, and he listed off like four, five, six things, you know, and he's like, well, let's go get a beer, you know.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, you told me that.
**Bclymer**: And like, and like that, that's the one, you know, the one time, right?
**Bclymer**: Then we finally, you know, set down and it's like, hey man, I'm not a fucking retard like everybody else that you've learned with, like, so at what point does that stop though?
**Bclymer**: Because there's all like, ask Liz, she's obviously gonna advocate for me, but I'm literally always working.
**Bclymer**: So at what point then are you, is everything done?
**Bclymer**: Because if that's the case, then I could show up and this is just talking for future guys we hire.
**Bclymer**: Like, I'm learning here.
**Bclymer**: I'm genuinely asking, like, I could show up at 6:45, take a 30 minute lunch, leave at 5 every day and like, I would always have shit to do.
**Bclymer**: Yes, there's always stuff like to be doing.
**Bclymer**: I would say a good rule of thumb, right, is if you just look at the commitments that you've made, are those all on track, right?
**Bclymer**: Are all your, you know, am I on track or on my emails, is there anything that I, you know, said that needed to get done that is not done?
**Bclymer**: Right, that's, that's the thing.
**Bclymer**: Like a prime example when I was at Peterson and I came on and they, they, I was running my first projects, coming from building hospitals to fucking warehouse.
**Bclymer**: Like, I'd be, I'd be at the pool by 2 o' clock because I was like, this is so goddamn easy.
**Bclymer**: Like I have 10 subs, they're all there.
**Bclymer**: One at a time.
**Bclymer**: I, you know, would visit the jobs, you know, all my submittals, the 30 of them there were, were all done.
**Bclymer**: Kapps were done.
**Bclymer**: Budget was right, like, because it was, it was a cakewalk compared to working for HCA where we have 76 change events.
**Bclymer**: And like, I'm constantly doing it.
**Bclymer**: Like, you know, there I'm working, you know, I Get to the job around 5:30, you know, work until 7.
**Bclymer**: Like, yeah, it never ended right.
**Bclymer**: Like, but that's the difference is when you two actually start to say, oh wow, okay, I've got all this shit done.
**Bclymer**: It's, it's marching to like a steady drum.
**Bclymer**: That's, that's the point.
**Bclymer**: But I don't think you could say that right now that all your stuff is marching steady and there's no issues.
**Bclymer**: Everything's caught up.
**Bclymer**: Am I wrong?
**Ataylor**: That's where it's.
**Ataylor**: When you talk about staying every day, what I try to do is.
**Ataylor**: It's an example would be like applied engineering contracts and submittals.
**Ataylor**: Like that would be one thing that, hey, my job's starting and I don't have this done.
**Ataylor**: So I'm going to stay today.
**Ataylor**: I may.
**Ataylor**: I could have left at 5 and said I was done, but now I'm gonna stay till six and knock this out so it's not on my plate tomorrow and it's done.
**Ataylor**: Like that's the importance of right?
**Ataylor**: You know, it's not staying every day, but seems like we got stuff every day that comes up like that.
**Ataylor**: And that's the stuff I try to get done in that time and stay at least to get so I'm not totally behind.
**Bclymer**: The next day I write a little thing, a little sticky note.
**Bclymer**: Like every day goals.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, three to five things.
**Bclymer**: Goals of things I have to fucking get done today.
**Bclymer**: Because I realize, you know, especially as we've been growing and I, you know, so much that comes my way, if I'm reactive all the time, like I just won't get stuff done.
**Bclymer**: You know, Part of the reason I like to get in know, early is not only does it set the tone, but I know that when people start working, shit's going to happen.
**Bclymer**: And then I would get derailed.
**Bclymer**: And so, you know, coming in, I've got these things I gotta get done and I check it off, blah, blah, blah, and I'm like, great, I got something done.
**Bclymer**: But the.
**Bclymer**: Then the other thing, like, you know, there's one thing to come in early, but like again, like you always like, it seems like very.
**Bclymer**: And that's why I had to write it down a spreadsheet or, you know, I actually did a chatgpt attendance tracker.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Because again, like, it's like, I get it, life happens.
**Bclymer**: And I'm not saying anything that you have is, you know, inexcusable, but I'm just like, damn, dude.
**Bclymer**: Like you do have, for whatever reason, a lot of stuff that Seems to happen that for whatever reason, you have to go.
**Bclymer**: Well, let's just start there.
**Bclymer**: One, I'm not making it up.
**Bclymer**: I know you're not making it up.
**Bclymer**: And two, I think I've proven that I'll get my work done.
**Bclymer**: Like, I stay late when I need to.
**Bclymer**: I mean, shit, last time you were here, I stay until 6:30.
**Bclymer**: I don't know what more happened.
**Bclymer**: The worst thing, like, what I'm talking about is to, like, if you're going to be a leader, you have to be present.
**Bclymer**: I understand.
**Bclymer**: And if you're telling me, aj, we're ready for you to start doing that, like, I know it shouldn't change things, but, yeah, it does change your mindset when it's like, okay, no, I have to make sure I'm here because they are relying on me to be in this management role.
**Bclymer**: For six months.
**Bclymer**: It was you and Jesse just.
**Bclymer**: Well, so what you're saying is like, Brandon, promote me and then I'll start.
**Bclymer**: I'm not saying that.
**Bclymer**: But at the same time, I.
**Bclymer**: Duly noted.
**Bclymer**: Like, this ended there.
**Bclymer**: Duly noted.
**Bclymer**: I.
**Bclymer**: I know I stay and I work my tail off and I work late nights and I am up in the morning.
**Bclymer**: I know that I may not be in the office by 6:45 or 6:47am and leave right at 5 because I'm not a freaking robot.
**Bclymer**: And I don't want to be a robot.
**Bclymer**: And I don't want guys working for me to feel like they have to like being a robot.
**Bclymer**: It's.
**Bclymer**: I'm not saying that you need to be a robot by any means.
**Bclymer**: Right?
**Bclymer**: All I'm saying is like, that if you, if you're going to be here and like, you know, even with, with, you know, now you've got a kid coming up, I'm like, man, like, if you're just like working from home, like, that is not as valuable, especially in this.
**Bclymer**: Like that.
**Bclymer**: Like, for me, like, you know, I'm in the office every day.
**Bclymer**: Whether it's just, you know, me or somebody else, doesn't matter.
**Bclymer**: Like, part of that is that to be able to just organically teach people, like, to be here.
**Bclymer**: Like, and that's where I'm talking about, like, that leadership role.
**Bclymer**: Like, even, you know, like, you can ask Jesse, like some of these other.
**Bclymer**: Like when we look at hiring, you know, like a new person, like a senior person, like the other Jesse or like Jim, I'm like, well, where are they going to work at?
**Bclymer**: Like, I don't like the remote thing.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Like, I'm not saying it can't be done, but at this company, like, that's one thing.
**Bclymer**: I'm like, the remote thing.
**Bclymer**: I do not think this is my goal.
**Bclymer**: I don't doubt that Jesse can work remote.
**Bclymer**: I can work remote, and we will be just as productive as if we were in here.
**Bclymer**: Brandon, I worked remote with you for a whole year.
**Bclymer**: I understand that.
**Bclymer**: And I'm not saying you.
**Bclymer**: You.
**Bclymer**: I'm not saying you aren't productive working remote.
**Bclymer**: What I'm saying is I'm not asked in.
**Bclymer**: To work remote is like, being present is huge.
**Bclymer**: Is important in a leadership role.
**Bclymer**: I hear you.
**Bclymer**: Like, like, that's why we have an actual office space in Tampa and here.
**Bclymer**: Like, because it's important to have that cohesion.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: So the other thing, like, you know, when.
**Bclymer**: When I read through this, like, some of the things that.
**Bclymer**: In ownership, running in the office, like, what do you, like, do you want to be in a business development role?
**Bclymer**: I think that my skills are more geared towards that.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: I know for a fact they are, but, I mean, I'm okay with that.
**Bclymer**: I just.
**Bclymer**: What I want to figure out is what is it that you feel like you're best at and that you'll enjoy, like, to get you to be in your zone of genius?
**Bclymer**: I enjoy it.
**Bclymer**: I enjoy it all.
**Bclymer**: I don't know.
**Bclymer**: I would turn around and say, like, what do you want me to do?
**Bclymer**: Me?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I want.
**Bclymer**: You want me to just sit there and be a project manager?
**Bclymer**: And then it's like, okay, well, then maybe we talk about something different.
**Bclymer**: I mean, I don't think that, like, you clearly don't need me to bring in work.
**Bclymer**: I know everybody bring it to work.
**Bclymer**: Well, okay, well, then if that's something that's important to you, then okay, that's what I know I can do that.
**Bclymer**: That's why I asked, like, would you rather be in just a business development role?
**Bclymer**: You can never be just business development.
**Bclymer**: Like, no, I wouldn't.
**Bclymer**: Because those guys don't do anything but shake hands and go to cigar bars.
**Bclymer**: Like, that's not what.
**Bclymer**: That's not what I want to do.
**Bclymer**: I like.
**Bclymer**: I like what I'm doing.
**Bclymer**: I want to be in a leadership role.
**Bclymer**: I think that if you're a project executive, well, those guys are actually bringing in work in my eyes.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Or they're.
**Bclymer**: They're trying.
**Bclymer**: They're trying to bring the.
**Bclymer**: Build a business like this, you know?
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: When you.
**Bclymer**: When you get out of ops, it's.
**Bclymer**: It's start bringing in sales and that's, that's what I wanted.
**Bclymer**: That's what, that's what I was trying to explain here.
**Bclymer**: It's like, yeah, more on the front end of things because I think I have that skill.
**Bclymer**: I know I have that skill.
**Bclymer**: I mean, like, you did, you did like, you know, and I think I even commented to Jesse about Stonegate.
**Bclymer**: Like, you did a really good job.
**Bclymer**: Whenever we were out there walking, you know, about keeping your mouth shut and literally, I mean, that's a real thing.
**Bclymer**: Like keeping your mouth shut and like letting me do it and learning and doing it.
**Bclymer**: Not trying to talk, just to say something and be relevant.
**Bclymer**: Like, that's a, that's a huge thing.
**Bclymer**: I can't tell you.
**Bclymer**: We were walking one time with Russ Moss Aventura and you know, they were, you know, they were talking.
**Bclymer**: I was walking with them.
**Bclymer**: I was.
**Bclymer**: Little note.
**Bclymer**: And I remember I said something, you know, in like, just to, you know, I shouldn't have said anything just to fucking, you know, stay relevant.
**Bclymer**: Jesse looks at me, goes, brandon, shut the fuck up.
**Bclymer**: No, I.
**Bclymer**: And I, that's my.
**Bclymer**: Yes, sir.
**Bclymer**: That's, that's a hundred percent a maturity thing.
**Bclymer**: Like, I had that issue when I was solely business development.
**Bclymer**: That is a solely maturity thing to try and stay relevant.
**Bclymer**: Like, oh, I know stuff too.
**Bclymer**: So I don't know.
**Bclymer**: It's okay to not know because I do know my skill is in the, the connections and the people.
**Bclymer**: That's.
**Bclymer**: Yes, you're very good at instantly building rapport with people instantly.
**Bclymer**: And so I, I would like to lean into that more.
**Bclymer**: But I, I want the experience in, in project management.
**Bclymer**: Look, guys, when I'm five years from now, ten years from now, I know with more experience, I'm going to be an absolute weapon.
**Bclymer**: I agree.
**Bclymer**: That's why.
**Bclymer**: So I'm, I'm learning.
**Bclymer**: That's why I say my attitude change to like me.
**Bclymer**: I need guidance on like, where I have the.
**Bclymer**: That's what I want to do.
**Bclymer**: But I'm also okay with, okay, no agent.
**Bclymer**: We really need you to be a project manager right now and run these jobs.
**Bclymer**: Like, okay, I hate the paperwork.
**Bclymer**: I hate it.
**Bclymer**: Not fun.
**Bclymer**: I can do it.
**Bclymer**: Nobody likes.
**Bclymer**: Don't want to do it.
**Bclymer**: Splash.
**Bclymer**: Nobody likes like applied Engineering.
**Bclymer**: Like, I was like, dude, I can sit here and just pound out these contracts and submittals.
**Bclymer**: Like, I don't find any joy in that.
**Bclymer**: Jesse, do you find joy in that?
**Ataylor**: Structural submittals.
**Ataylor**: I like looking at them now and then, but not really.
**Ataylor**: But the fact is, like, if it doesn't get done.
**Ataylor**: You don't like doing it, how's it gonna get done?
**Bclymer**: You're right.
**Ataylor**: And then when you got a PM working under you and he doesn't have his submittals done, what are you gonna say?
**Ataylor**: Yeah, I remember those two.
**Ataylor**: I'd shit them, put them in the corner and never did them either.
**Ataylor**: Are you gonna be like, listen, it's your job.
**Ataylor**: You gotta move that.
**Ataylor**: We get a job to get these submittals done and, and the job bought out.
**Ataylor**: That's what our, that's the tone we need to set with people or else we're gonna be babysitting them the whole time.
**Bclymer**: And I'm gonna, I'm doing my best and I'm going to over prove to you I'm plenty capable of it.
**Bclymer**: So that's my goal.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I mean, good.
**Ataylor**: Hey, we got this to crow Plan Hub thing at 2.
**Ataylor**: How important is that?
**Bclymer**: What?
**Ataylor**: Brandon, the Plan Hub meeting.
**Bclymer**: What Plan Hub meeting?
**Ataylor**: Maria is on there telling us how Plan Hub works.
**Bclymer**: Oh, do we need to tell them to give, Tell them we'll be, give us 10 minutes for a meeting.
**Bclymer**: Right now?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, we got, we got one.
**Bclymer**: We got one more to do.
**Bclymer**: How come we get there?
**Ataylor**: All right?
**Bclymer**: Because I don't, I don't have any more questions.
**Bclymer**: They're trying to sell us.
**Bclymer**: They can wait.
**Bclymer**: I don't have any more questions.
**Bclymer**: She spotted an hour.
**Bclymer**: Anyway, we're only going to need 15 minutes.
**Bclymer**: So how can you help me get there?
**Bclymer**: I.
**Bclymer**: I think if you guys, I say inclusion on the front end of projects and you, you harped on that, like, meaning.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I want, I want to be able to see how, I love seeing how you navigate conversations and I think that we would make a great team and bringing in work here in the next couple years.
**Bclymer**: So I just need to know how you like things to be sold.
**Bclymer**: Because I can sell that.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I mean, and that's the biggest thing is like, and again, I.
**Bclymer**: Everything is always recorded and you're in a lot of the meetings, you know, of how things are.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: And that's why, you know, I'll meet with you and always, you know, I always try to help and teach and everything I did.
**Bclymer**: That's why I said, hey, like, here's a tactic.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Hey, are you guys, you know, do you guys ever take outside investors for your developments?
**Bclymer**: That's a great way to get in at least a conversation started with a developer because you're not asking them from work, you're offering them to help Grow their business.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: And it's a way different light that's reframing it.
**Bclymer**: Your status is up here now.
**Bclymer**: Oh, he's an investor versus he's a builder.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: And so it's just like the seven level selling stuff.
**Bclymer**: Like that's, I, I follow a lot of that.
**Bclymer**: Jeremy, you know, in, in as far as inclusion on the front end projects, I mean, you are.
**Bclymer**: But again, that goes back to the I can't be there and everything.
**Bclymer**: I know nothing would get done.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I think we harped on a lot of these.
**Bclymer**: Like, number two, the trust and putting me in tough situation.
**Bclymer**: Like, I, I said that is like, I am a sink or swim guy.
**Bclymer**: Just talk to him.
**Bclymer**: Oh.
**Bclymer**: Like, I know I'm a, I'm a sink or swim guy.
**Bclymer**: Like, I, I, I need more.
**Bclymer**: And I know that takes a lot of like, okay, we need to see, you know, you got to see what the risk is.
**Bclymer**: And just that's how I learned.
**Bclymer**: That's how I've always learned.
**Bclymer**: I mean, I didn't go to college for this stuff.
**Bclymer**: You don't learn anything.
**Bclymer**: Well, you know what I mean though?
**Bclymer**: Like, I learned from getting put in situation, being like, all right, like when I joined you, I was like, I had ran like three jobs at a time or job, you know, if that.
**Bclymer**: And I was superintending construction manager and they were all an id.
**Bclymer**: Like, I was like, just, you're like, just do it a lot of time.
**Bclymer**: And I fired from the hip on some of it and we, we made some of it work.
**Bclymer**: So that's how I learned best a lot of the time.
**Bclymer**: And so, so keep doing that.
**Bclymer**: One thing I would say, like, instead of the fire from the hip standpoint, like anytime, like, you know, and I do this all the time.
**Bclymer**: I don't know how something works or whatever.
**Bclymer**: Like, especially as I'm dealing with some of this front end stuff that I've never done and I don't know how to do it.
**Bclymer**: Like, I'll go look it up and see and teach myself.
**Bclymer**: Not just like, make an assumption.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Like, that's going to get you in trouble.
**Bclymer**: And like when you talk about the sink or swim thing, like, it costs you money.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Like, you know, if I was like, Here you go, A.J.
**Bclymer**: go run this $40 million hotel.
**Bclymer**: And I got to say, sink or swim.
**Bclymer**: If you sink, we all sink.
**Bclymer**: That's why I was trying to describe it before.
**Bclymer**: Like, I'm, I'm, I was hammering out thoughts here.
**Bclymer**: I was saying that's how I learned is by putting me in tough situations.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: That's how I learned best.
**Bclymer**: That's what I was trying to say with that.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And then number three, this, this comes back to hiring more help from me, meaning like that way I can grow and learn and how to, how to delegate.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: And also more is geared towards like the one, like I've always told you, like, I want to be in the room with you guys and, and to do that is to get people to help me run the jobs.
**Bclymer**: And then I can, I should be able to do it all.
**Bclymer**: I know you had to, but I should.
**Bclymer**: If I could get more help, man, I know I could reach that 10 million mark.
**Bclymer**: Well, that's, that's my goal.
**Bclymer**: And that is the ultimate all.
**Bclymer**: I, I had it.
**Bclymer**: I probably shouldn't have this up in front of people.
**Bclymer**: I mean, that's, that's fine.
**Bclymer**: The biggest thing though, with that, like, I can't give you more help because I'm not confident that like, again, right now, if they're not doing something, yeah, it's the same shit you don't do.
**Bclymer**: And so how are you going to hold them accountable?
**Bclymer**: I hear that.
**Bclymer**: That's the thing.
**Bclymer**: Like, that's why, you know, I was like, okay, you know, run applied, run Neiman and do it by the book.
**Bclymer**: Correct, Right.
**Bclymer**: Like that.
**Bclymer**: So I can see like, okay, like he can actually do it.
**Bclymer**: Because again, you, you say, oh, I've done that.
**Bclymer**: I know how to do it.
**Bclymer**: Like, well, since you've been employed here, you have not.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And that's the thing where it's like, I have to know that you can do it.
**Bclymer**: Because, sure, some of these little jobs and ti's like, yeah, we don't fucking need submittals on half the shit.
**Bclymer**: It doesn't matter.
**Bclymer**: But to run a big job, you gotta have all that stuff.
**Bclymer**: I'm learning.
**Bclymer**: I know that now and I'm gonna do it.
**Bclymer**: And so we'll just see in a couple months.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
**Bclymer**: That's, that's, that's my goal, right?
**Bclymer**: Is that you take this to say, okay, like, I'm going to re.
**Bclymer**: Order my priorities and say, if I want to get here, here's the things I have to do.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, that's my problem too.
**Bclymer**: I'm always, My dad always used to get on me too.
**Bclymer**: And you like, I'm a dreamer and you get stuck in the tyranny of how.
**Bclymer**: And then it's like, quit thinking over here, get this done.
**Bclymer**: And then you can think up There.
**Bclymer**: First step first.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And like I said, I know I can do this stuff, but it's like, I'm thinking of that over there.
**Bclymer**: I'm like, man, I got it.
**Bclymer**: But yeah, I mean it, dude.
**Bclymer**: It's again, like, it's the same thing.
**Bclymer**: Like, I, I want to do all the, all these big jobs.
**Bclymer**: I Wish we had 10 grownups.
**Bclymer**: Right?
**Bclymer**: Like, you know, I, I, I'm constantly, you know, trying to, to grow this and do this.
**Bclymer**: But I understand too, that we have to have it happen over time.
**Bclymer**: Like, I want it tomorrow.
**Bclymer**: You know.
**Bclymer**: Trust me.
**Bclymer**: I built.
**Bclymer**: You know, I hate it whenever we don't get buildings that I got to build.
**Bclymer**: Well, I'm super thankful.
**Bclymer**: We've been through so much and we're going to continue.
**Bclymer**: And I just, I know I'm an emotional, passionate guy.
**Bclymer**: And the bitching, I only bitch to you a lot.
**Bclymer**: That's because you're also a friend too.
**Bclymer**: And I know you're trying to step more into a role of a boss.
**Bclymer**: I've noticed that.
**Bclymer**: And just know that I don't bitch to the other guys.
**Bclymer**: I get it.
**Bclymer**: But it's also like, like, you know, like when you're, when you're coming in and, you know, bitching about whatever, it's just like, I don't need another thing to deal with.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: I agree.
**Bclymer**: Like, you know, it's, it's the same thing that I tell half these other people.
**Bclymer**: Like 1, 3, 1.
**Bclymer**: Like, what's the problem?
**Bclymer**: Give me three options.
**Bclymer**: And what do you suggest?
**Bclymer**: That's, that's what I want to see.
**Bclymer**: Like, yeah, I can't.
**Bclymer**: You know, when people, I'm just like, are you.
**Bclymer**: Like, it pisses me off.
**Bclymer**: I don't think I come to you with problems too much anymore besides the great one.
**Bclymer**: I try not to come to you with anything.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I mean, it's.
**Bclymer**: Again, that's the rule you instilled in me a long time ago is, okay, here's what I would do, but here's the situation.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I mean, again, that's fine to come and ask an opinion.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Like, but you just gotta, obviously that's problem solving is what are my options.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Okay, man.
**Bclymer**: So you're, I looked it up.
**Bclymer**: You're at 107.
**Bclymer**: So bump me up to 110.
**Bclymer**: 5.
**Bclymer**: So a little over.
**Bclymer**: I think there's like 4% raise or whatever.
**Bclymer**: Take anything you give me, dude.
**Bclymer**: Thank you.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: So obviously in July when that payroll hits, you know, one thing, like, you know that I, I always do is called Can I C a N I.
**Bclymer**: Constant and never ending improvement.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Like, you know, so if you say, like, you know, what can I do today to get 1% better?
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Like that's going to compound, you know, over a year, over two years, whatever, it's going to make you 10 times better.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, well, you just keep at it, so.
**Bclymer**: Got a lot of stuff coming up, a lot of stuff to do.
**Bclymer**: I appreciate it.
