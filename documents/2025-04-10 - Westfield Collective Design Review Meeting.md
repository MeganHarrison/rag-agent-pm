## Transcript
**Bclymer**: Job site.
**Jdawson**: It's good.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, no, it's going good.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Morning, guys.
**Bclymer**: Morning.
**Nbigler**: Morning.
**Jdawson**: So we are underway out there on site.
**Jdawson**: We got mobilized out there this week.
**Jdawson**: We have ag peers coming in on the 28th, and other than that, we'll be doing some Stormline and building up the pad in the meantime.
**Jdawson**: So I think Ashton's still on vacation.
**Jdawson**: I know Mike is on vacation this week.
**Jdawson**: I don't think anything for him is going to affect anybody here.
**Jdawson**: So we'll move on past civil structural drawings.
**Jdawson**: So Nick had sent over the reactions of the anchor bolt drawings on Tuesday.
**Jdawson**: Jerrica got those.
**Jdawson**: Nick, we're curious where the.
**Jdawson**: When.
**Jdawson**: Where's the actual drawings of the building?
**Awoodhams**: Yeah, the permit drawings come out typically one week, one to two weeks after the anchor rod drawings before construction reactions.
**Awoodhams**: And for this project, we've been told that we can expect those by the end of the day on Friday is what we were told this week.
**Nbigler**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Those will be 4, 11.
**Jdawson**: And then, Jerrica, you said you needed a week to get your updated foundation plans and everything for the ag peer guys to con to start going with their shop drawing.
**Jdawson**: So does that put you out to next Tuesday, Wednesday, before you can get that back to us?
**Gdesmit**: Yes, it does.
**Gdesmit**: We're working on it now, and we'll try to get it sooner, but that's a realistic time frame.
**Bclymer**: Nick, I'm assuming that that includes the mezzanine framing as well for that Friday timeline.
**Awoodhams**: That is correct.
**Awoodhams**: That's what I was told by the project manager.
**Awoodhams**: Yep.
**Nbigler**: Perfect.
**Awoodhams**: Okay, thank you, guys.
**Awoodhams**: Sorry about the delay.
**Awoodhams**: That was not impressive.
**Awoodhams**: I was very frustrated, and I can only imagine what that did to Jerrica and Jeff.
**Awoodhams**: So I apologize.
**Awoodhams**: And we were trying our best.
**Awoodhams**: Somebody had, like, a personal family emergency, which those things happen, you know, whether it's a small company or big company.
**Awoodhams**: And it crushed their schedule.
**Awoodhams**: I don't like hearing about surprises at the end of the day when I'm supposed to be expecting drawings.
**Awoodhams**: So that's what happened.
**Awoodhams**: Just so everyone gets the story from me.
**Jdawson**: All right, well, yeah, so it's a couple days.
**Jdawson**: We can.
**Jdawson**: We can.
**Jdawson**: We can deal with that.
**Jdawson**: But, yeah, it's a snowball effect one way or another for us, this whole design team, and you guys internally, and it's all good.
**Jdawson**: We'll keep moving forward.
**Jdawson**: Anchor rod drawings were also sent over to Jericho, but I did put in just an actual submittal through job Planner and tagged you on that.
**Jdawson**: So whenever you get a chance.
**Nbigler**: As.
**Jdawson**: Long as that's gonna shoot that back.
**Jdawson**: Do you have to stamp off on the elevator shop drawings?
**Jdawson**: I sent you this, so that's the middle.
**Jdawson**: But I don't, I don't know if you have to or not.
**Gdesmit**: I would like to take a look at it, and I can do that as we're working on the foundations as well, just to verify everything's been incorporated and so we can, I can have that returned by the time we send out our drawings, if that works.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that would be fine.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: You, you, you just.
**Jdawson**: I just have those two in your court right now.
**Gdesmit**: Okay, sounds good.
**Gdesmit**: And then, Nick, I did have a question for you in your email with the reactions and anchor bolts, the next paragraph says something about me signing off as the design inspecting professional.
**Gdesmit**: And I just had a question about that.
**Gdesmit**: Since I didn't design the building, I don't know how I could be the design inspecting professional.
**Gdesmit**: So that might be a different conversation outside of this meeting, but just wanted to verify what exactly you meant there.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah.
**Awoodhams**: So on the building permit for the state of Indiana, the person who designs the foundations, this building actually sits on signs that line.
**Awoodhams**: So it's never been a part of the metal building person or their engineer's signature on that line.
**Awoodhams**: So I probably ordered 60 buildings and 60 times the structural engineer signs that line.
**Awoodhams**: And it feels like, oh, well, I don't size the steel.
**Awoodhams**: Well, that's not what the, what that line is actually trying to communicate to the state.
**Awoodhams**: It's that you're the person that's putting all the pieces of the puzzle together.
**Awoodhams**: And that is how it's been explained to me.
**Awoodhams**: So anytime I supply a building, I put that on our bid confirmation and communicate that to my, you know, general contractor.
**Ashton**: I would say that you're not the.
**Awoodhams**: First person to ask this question, as you can imagine.
**Gdesmit**: Yeah.
**Awoodhams**: But every time it's been described like, no, no metal building company signs that for the state of Indiana.
**Awoodhams**: It's not like they're skirting out of any type of responsibility.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, because they're.
**Ashton**: That's not the.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah, we size the steel, but it's all based on your parameters and your building criteria.
**Gdesmit**: Yeah, I absolutely get that.
**Gdesmit**: Alito will reach out separately on that item and kind of talk through that a little bit more.
**Gdesmit**: So just heads up on that.
**Ashton**: Sure, not a problem.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: We have.
**Jdawson**: Do we have anybody from the plumbing?
**Jdawson**: Okay, that part of this.
**Jdawson**: Jerrica, here, we're.
**Nbigler**: There we go.
**Jdawson**: All right, part of this here, Jerrica, this is.
**Jdawson**: We're looking at the grease trap right here outside.
**Jdawson**: Just Outside the building, we're putting in ag piers, and I believe we have, like, a one to one ratio where we need to.
**Jdawson**: We need to be that far off before we dig.
**Jdawson**: Dig something.
**Jdawson**: Is it.
**Jdawson**: Is it.
**Jdawson**: Is it 1 to 1?
**Jdawson**: 1?
**Jdawson**: Is it 2 to 1?
**Jdawson**: As far as locating this grease trap, we're just kind of concerned with getting close to this footer.
**Jdawson**: We're going to have, I think, some ag peers going along our grade beam, too.
**Gdesmit**: Sure.
**Gdesmit**: How deep is it?
**Jdawson**: It'll be about nine feet.
**Gdesmit**: Oh, okay.
**Gdesmit**: Let me review the geotech report and see what their recommendation is.
**Gdesmit**: Two to one is the safe answer, but they might recommend something a little bit different.
**Gdesmit**: So let me look at that, and I'll get back to you.
**Jdawson**: That would be coming two feet out for every one foot we go down.
**Nbigler**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: So we'd have to be at 9ft.
**Jdawson**: We'd have to be 18ft away from.
**Nbigler**: The building.
**Jdawson**: Or 18ft away from the footers.
**Jdawson**: That's not good.
**Jdawson**: That puts us way out here.
**Gdesmit**: Yeah.
**Gdesmit**: Also, we can put.
**Gdesmit**: I would imagine it's from the bottom of our footing, so it wouldn't have to be quite that far away.
**Gdesmit**: Not from grade, but from the bottom of our footing.
**Brhoades**: So.
**Gdesmit**: For the zone of influence to apply.
**Gdesmit**: Let me look into this a little bit closer, and I'll get back to you.
**Nbigler**: Okay.
**Jfield**: I can.
**Jdawson**: I can figure out.
**Jdawson**: Ask the ag peer guys, too, as they're designing it, and let them know we're going to get this thing in the ground with the site.
**Jdawson**: Guys.
**Gdesmit**: Yeah, sure.
**Jdawson**: All right, Jeff, we're up to you got some updated interior elevations coming to the owner this week, correct?
**Nbigler**: Yep, yep.
**Bclymer**: We're working through getting all the rest of the color and everything applied to those based on the discussion.
**Bclymer**: So like I told Brandon, we will send those on Friday, and then we can either review them Monday, or we can review them Tuesday at the oac.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: When.
**Jdawson**: And was this Friday also the finished schedule, or is that next Friday for you guys?
**Bclymer**: Well, I'd like to review, like.
**Nbigler**: Yeah, we'll.
**Bclymer**: We'll have the finished schedule that we can go through all the materials with.
**Nbigler**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And then, you know, if they have any changes or anything, obviously we'll get that updated for the.
**Bclymer**: For the final set that we send out that has all the mezzanine, you know, the actual, like, section details and everything attached to it as well.
**Nbigler**: All right.
**Jdawson**: So you guys are closing in on that final.
**Jdawson**: Yep, I found.
**Jdawson**: Okay, perfect.
**Jdawson**: Dave Biddle sent you over an email yesterday just letting you know that they had mailed you.
**Jdawson**: The counter shutter selection, physical sample.
**Jdawson**: So I'll, I'll create a submittal with that just like I did the CMU and the other stuff.
**Jdawson**: You, you sent me a picture for the metal panels in the cmu.
**Jdawson**: So if you, if you want to do the same thing, whichever one you select, I'll create a submittal through it and track it.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Jdawson**: That way.
**Jdawson**: That hasn't arrived to you yet?
**Bclymer**: It has not, not that I am aware of.
**Nbigler**: All right.
**Jdawson**: The awnings, before we get further than that.
**Jdawson**: As far as color samples, the awnings, you had called out for them to match the adjacent panel.
**Jdawson**: So you, you're not intending for these to be anodized.
**Jdawson**: Black anodized.
**Jdawson**: See?
**Jdawson**: Get back to it real quick.
**Jdawson**: It was on the elevation plan.
**Nbigler**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I think when we initially had.
**Brhoades**: Number.
**Jdawson**: Five refinish aluminum cannon color to match MP3.
**Nbigler**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So MP3 is the dark color.
**Jdawson**: So they would be black, cool ebony.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: I don't have to do.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, they don't have to do a custom color.
**Bclymer**: If it wants to be a black powder coat or black anodized.
**Bclymer**: Whichever one you guys prefer from a cost standpoint as final.
**Bclymer**: Guys.
**Jdawson**: All right then as far as splitting the building.
**Jdawson**: So they are going to split the building.
**Jdawson**: We're going to condo it out.
**Jdawson**: I think we discussed putting the designating that wall as a one hour rated.
**Jdawson**: I didn't look at this.
**Jdawson**: Was that done on this, on this set of plans, Jeff?
**Bclymer**: It's in there.
**Bclymer**: Did they have any?
**Bclymer**: When I talked to Brandon on the phone last week, we were going to put it in there, but because we were going to upload an additional set at the end of next week, he thought it might be good to hold off just in case they actually made a decision between now and then.
**Jdawson**: Oh, I thought your recommendation was to go ahead and just mark it off as that because it's the same assembly.
**Jdawson**: It's just needs.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, correct.
**Bclymer**: And if, if, if, if it gets to that point next week when we re upload the set for the state for the one they're actually going to review because we got to wait till we have the structural drawings to upload anyway.
**Bclymer**: I can always go in and just fix that one sheet.
**Bclymer**: If we just want to put it in there for the time being, it's not a big deal.
**Bclymer**: I'll just re upload the packet to this state.
**Nbigler**: All right.
**Jdawson**: Without looking too, too much into the masonry.
**Jdawson**: These.
**Jdawson**: These are just all a bunch of walls, right?
**Jdawson**: Correct.
**Jdawson**: That's just 15 masonry walls here.
**Bclymer**: No no, yeah, that's just all the steel and masonry wall types just with all the detail on it.
**Jdawson**: All right, so a couple things that are in question right now.
**Jdawson**: It'll kind of, I guess, depend on the financing, on how the.
**Jdawson**: They split it up.
**Jdawson**: Permitting wise, we're moving forward at this time with how we've designed the building for all.
**Jdawson**: All that weren't on the conversation earlier this week about that.
**Jdawson**: And then once we get through permitting at that point, if we're going to go back and make a revision to add a bathroom or rerun water or do anything that is extra and required for splitting these buildings, we'll do that as one revision to the.
**Jdawson**: To the permit set at that time.
**Jdawson**: So kind of right now the idea is putting.
**Brhoades**: Jeff, we don't really want to change anything until after we get a permit.
**Jdawson**: Right?
**Nbigler**: Yeah, agreed.
**Jdawson**: Kind of their idea right now is adding if.
**Jdawson**: If.
**Jdawson**: If we split.
**Jdawson**: Splitting these up, if they require us to add a bathroom, we would pull.
**Jdawson**: Pull one in right here.
**Jdawson**: Shift this door.
**Bclymer**: That corner.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, shift this door over.
**Jdawson**: And then the two.
**Jdawson**: The two doors to go in would be there into the bathroom from the inside.
**Jdawson**: Then we just have a, you know, men and women's half or whatever.
**Jdawson**: We're gonna do something like that.
**Jdawson**: And that way we could, without messing with the pud, we'd be able to just bring this masonry out.
**Nbigler**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So that's.
**Jdawson**: That's what we're looking at doing if we do that.
**Jdawson**: And then, of course, we've already discussed metering out the G and the water.
**Jdawson**: That was that for that MEP design.
**Jdawson**: Nothing yet for the ducting, I guess.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: I don't have Mike on here anyways.
**Jdawson**: DE drawings are also due by the end of the week.
**Jdawson**: Do we have DE on here?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I'm here.
**Jdawson**: We're.
**Jfield**: We're still on track for that.
**Jfield**: I have one question about the kitchen equipment, about whether or not we want the power to be in the floor or if it can come from the ceiling for the equipment that's in the middle spaces.
**Jfield**: I think Daniel said he was going to get with the owner to confirm.
**Nbigler**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I remember that.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Daniel didn't jump on here.
**Jfield**: I'll follow up with them, but otherwise we're good.
**Nbigler**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Gas and electric loads.
**Jdawson**: You guys got your stuff with Duke in motion, Tell.
**Jdawson**: So tell me, do they provide the primary and or secondary?
**Jdawson**: Because this is.
**Jdawson**: This is ours on site here.
**Jdawson**: Does Duke provide this one also?
**Jfield**: Sorry, say that again.
**Jdawson**: So you.
**Jdawson**: We have our primary and our secondary transformer.
**Jdawson**: So this is Our secondary here on site.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jfield**: And that's, that's the only one that is necessary.
**Brhoades**: There's only one transformer, Glenn.
**Brhoades**: That's it.
**Nbigler**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: I thought we were putting a primary out here and then running into our.
**Brhoades**: Transfer, your sleeves will go from the power on off site to that transformer.
**Brhoades**: Primary sleeves.
**Brhoades**: That's it.
**Nbigler**: Okay.
**Brhoades**: I don't.
**Jdawson**: I, I for some reason was thinking we're having two transformers.
**Jdawson**: All right, that helps.
**Jfield**: We have two services.
**Jfield**: We're.
**Jfield**: We're splitting one service off for the volleyball building and then one for the restaurant building.
**Ashton**: Yeah.
**Jfield**: One transformer.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so you, you, Are you doing that now or are you going to wait until we.
**Jdawson**: You're not doing that now, right?
**Jdawson**: Because that's not.
**Jdawson**: So we don't have that in the plans.
**Jdawson**: We'll.
**Jdawson**: We'll go back and add the extra metering for the gas, electrical, any water sanitary that has to go to those bathrooms.
**Jdawson**: Anything like that will get, will get added once they give us the final go ahead at this time, we're moving forward with the plans as.
**Jfield**: Okay, yeah, I can get that changed.
**Jfield**: Yeah.
**Nbigler**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Well, do you agree, Jeff?
**Jdawson**: We'll keep, keep that, keep it the way it is now.
**Jdawson**: We'll go back and split it later.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: What I'm going to do, Jesse, because I think you're right, if we don't think they're going to have that decision made in the next.
**Bclymer**: By the time we were to upload.
**Bclymer**: I'll just go ahead and make that change now and I'll re upload that packet to the state so it's in there and we can just cover our bases with it.
**Jdawson**: I mean, the decision is made that they are going to condo out the buildings.
**Brhoades**: So like, is everyone's drawings done at this point to be submitted for permit minus the structural that we're missing?
**Jdawson**: Deem is due tomorrow, but Mike has already turned in mechanical plumbing and then Jeff has the architectural.
**Jdawson**: So those three have already been submitted.
**Jdawson**: So we have.
**Brhoades**: All the drawings are done and going to be submitted based on what we have now.
**Brhoades**: We're not going to change one discipline or two for the new change and put it in there.
**Brhoades**: It'll just be confusing.
**Brhoades**: So right now, like we know what we're going to change for the revision set.
**Brhoades**: We just need to get finished with what we have now based on the current design so we can get them submitted.
**Nbigler**: Correct.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I don't.
**Jdawson**: The plumbers didn't.
**Jdawson**: Didn't separate theirs out either at that time yet, did they?
**Nbigler**: I don't Think so.
**Jdawson**: Okay, we'll get that gas standpipe terminated out there with center point.
**Jdawson**: And then Ashton was helping work on that.
**Jdawson**: We got that handed off to us.
**Jdawson**: I think that's about it.
**Jdawson**: So design deliverables.
**Jdawson**: Here's where we were at.
**Jdawson**: And then as stuff has started coming in, we'll track it down here.
**Jdawson**: So last week we had mechanical and plumbing set show up on Thursday.
**Jdawson**: We ended up getting the architectural set sent over and also submitted on Tuesday the 8th, as well as the metal building stuff showed up on Tuesday the 8th.
**Jdawson**: Got electrical set tomorrow, structural set next.
**Jdawson**: What's that?
**Jdawson**: Wednesday?
**Jdawson**: Tuesday or Wednesday.
**Jdawson**: So I put the 16th on that now.
**Brhoades**: Hey, Jeff, one thing.
**Brhoades**: Just a quick look at your drawings.
**Brhoades**: I didn't see on the roof plan any of the grease ducts or makeup error.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, it's because we don't have those physically in our model.
**Nbigler**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Because it's all CAD stuff from the other sheets.
**Bclymer**: I mean, we can.
**Bclymer**: If we get a base file for those, we can add them to the roof plan, but just from a state submittal set.
**Bclymer**: I don't know if that's correct.
**Brhoades**: Okay.
**Brhoades**: They're not going to see it on the mechanical or do they even look at anything?
**Bclymer**: To be honest with you, as of lately, I don't really know.
**Bclymer**: I think really the only thing that they look at is the life safety plan.
**Bclymer**: And make sure that the square footage that you have on the COVID matches what you filed for so they can make sure you pay the correct fee.
**Brhoades**: Yeah.
**Brhoades**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Jesse, what were you're talking about?
**Jdawson**: The RTUs here or the exhaust fence?
**Brhoades**: We have two makeup air units and we got five exhaust fans.
**Brhoades**: Yeah, they go along this curve.
**Brhoades**: They're just not there.
**Brhoades**: So.
**Brhoades**: Okay, that's my question.
**Brhoades**: But if it's not needed for the state approval, then.
**Brhoades**: But it's currently on all the MEP drawings.
**Brhoades**: I guess.
**Nbigler**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I mean, and that's the other thing too.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: They'll look at the MEP drawings and see that we usually don't have each piece of mechanical equipment shown in the architectural roof plan or, like, individual, like, vents and those sorts of things.
**Bclymer**: So I don't think it's a critical issue at all.
**Brhoades**: Is the mechanical set part of this, Glenn?
**Jdawson**: No.
**Jdawson**: So I'm looking at the freaking plumbing set.
**Jdawson**: Sorry, I didn't realize I didn't have the other one pulled up.
**Jdawson**: This is all hood drawings.
**Nbigler**: Okay.
**Brhoades**: So we kept all the ducks on this side.
**Brhoades**: So that's where.
**Brhoades**: And Nick, you said you're going to have us the actual structure drawings Friday?
**Ashton**: Yeah, by the end of the day on Friday is what we were told.
**Ashton**: We were told that Monday and then confirmed on Tuesday.
**Awoodhams**: And.
**Jdawson**: Hold on, here they go.
**Jdawson**: Jesse, they do go through the wall on the second floor.
**Brhoades**: Okay.
**Ashton**: The only thing that you're gonna see in my permit drawings that we've worked through with Marco Pruden is that on the Volleyball Building, they noticed that the peaks weren't gonna line up properly, the peak height, because the widths of the buildings are different.
**Ashton**: And what we decided to do to make it look cleaner and a cleaner detail between the buildings is the volleyball roof pitch is like closer, like 0.93 instead of a 112 pitch.
**Ashton**: It's not going to change any of the reactions.
**Ashton**: We've confirmed that Jerrica.
**Ashton**: And it's going to help all the heights and the peak line up at the same time.
**Brhoades**: Go back to that architectural roof plan so we can look at it.
**Brhoades**: When you say same.
**Nbigler**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: But it was.
**Brhoades**: Looks like it was always dying into midway into the other one.
**Awoodhams**: Correct.
**Ashton**: But the height of it.
**Ashton**: And our President Brandt, he was on the phone with Varco Pruden.
**Ashton**: He's here and can kind of describe the difference in what Varco Pruden, what they saw that was going to potentially be a difficult detail.
**Tom**: So basically the roof pitch at 112 on the volleyball building, the height of the peak was going to be about 6 inches above the peak height on the dining hall.
**Ashton**: So that was going to be nasty right there.
**Jfield**: That's.
**Tom**: That's.
**Tom**: If you actually run the numbers and do the calculations.
**Tom**: That depiction that you're showing there is not accurate to what the actual dimensions are when you run the pitches of each location.
**Tom**: And so in order to keep it at the same height so the peaks are the same and there's not an awkward 6 inch difference where the two roofs come together.
**Tom**: We simply lowered the pitch on the Volleyball Building to a point nine two or whatever it is instead of one in order to make that match and make it a cleaner detail and a.
**Brhoades**: Cleaner look is that almost puts the.
**Brhoades**: I don't know if these rooftops are located per mechanical, but now you got a valley almost.
**Brhoades**: I don't know, maybe it's far enough away.
**Jdawson**: He's saying this doesn't show exactly where it is.
**Jdawson**: Does the bridge tie in right now to the same.
**Jdawson**: Does it tie it here now, Brent?
**Jdawson**: Yes, Correct.
**Tom**: So the two peaks will meet.
**Nbigler**: Okay, right there.
**Nbigler**: Nick.
**Bclymer**: I'm assuming that the updated IFC model will display that.
**Ashton**: Yeah, we already.
**Ashton**: I think we made that decision on Monday.
**Nbigler**: Yep.
**Ashton**: There you go.
**Jdawson**: Correct.
**Brhoades**: Okay, Gotcha works.
**Ashton**: Yeah, I mean, we're probably going to want to consider those lines as we go through the roof and up, you know, the mezzanine columns for final placement of where the roof curves need to be.
**Ashton**: You know.
**Jdawson**: We'Re looking at putting them.
**Jdawson**: That chase right there goes right up that wall.
**Jdawson**: So these are going to be right here.
**Jdawson**: Those make up air units.
**Jdawson**: Roughly.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Ashton**: But they're small roof curbs.
**Ashton**: Like the actual opening is what.
**Jdawson**: I don't remember.
**Jdawson**: They're not big.
**Jdawson**: Weren't they like two by two or something like that?
**Ashton**: They run up the column in the mezzanine, and.
**Jdawson**: These are the ones go.
**Ashton**: Through the roof on the other side, maybe on the volleyball roof or instead of in the valley.
**Brhoades**: Well, I think you got.
**Brhoades**: You're showing them a little too far out.
**Brhoades**: They're going to be.
**Brhoades**: They should be fine.
