## Transcript
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Are you getting in this accounting meeting?
**Fnjie**: Sorry, Jesse.
**Bclymer**: Hello, Maria.
**Fnjie**: Hi.
**Bclymer**: Hello, Fatima.
**Accounting**: Jesse.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Accounting**: Where are you located, Jesse?
**Accounting**: Are you in Florida or in Indiana?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, St.
**Bclymer**: Pete.
**Bclymer**: Can't you see the big old like palm tree?
**Accounting**: Oh, yeah, I do see the palm trees now.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Fnjie**: Okay, guys, Brandon is here.
**Fnjie**: Any updates, you guys, for accounting, Something that we need?
**Accounting**: Maria, I have a list I want to send to you.
**Accounting**: A list of items that Justin needs, Brandon's information.
**Accounting**: List of items he needs on Brandon stuff.
**Accounting**: So I'll.
**Accounting**: I'll send you that.
**Accounting**: As far as accounting goes, Brandon, I think there was a little bit of a miscommunication in the email Jose sent this morning about Megan or to Megan.
**Accounting**: We had.
**Accounting**: We had some.
**Accounting**: It was about the notion.
**Accounting**: Notion.
**Accounting**: Notion transactions.
**Accounting**: The ready to export tab was showing as imported.
**Accounting**: It was only showing imported, like uncoated transactions.
**Accounting**: So he was trying to ask Megan if she can fix that and have it showing approved.
**Accounting**: But we figured that out.
**Accounting**: We fixed it.
**Jdawson**: Good deal.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: All right, I have something.
**Jdawson**: What's it gonna take to get our damn insurance paid to where it doesn't get canceled again?
**Jdawson**: Because this happens all the time.
**Justin**: Brandon, just to clear with that insurance, I haven't received that statement that Lisa has sent.
**Justin**: That is the latest one, the one that we are paying the other one, the 599, every month.
**Justin**: That was the last statement.
**Justin**: So the one that Lisa sent is a new statement that was due last May 27, which I didn't receive.
**Justin**: We just received when he.
**Justin**: When she sent it just June 3rd.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so today is June 3rd.
**Jdawson**: So the.
**Jdawson**: You don't have it or you do have it?
**Justin**: I have already process it.
**Jdawson**: Okay, well, we have.
**Jdawson**: We continue to keep getting our insurance policies canceled.
**Jdawson**: And I don't understand why.
**Jdawson**: Like, what do we have to do?
**Jdawson**: Like, pay these things in full for the year.
**Jdawson**: Put a reminder, save it somewhere.
**Jdawson**: I don't care what system you guys all have to work out, but there should be no reason why our insurance gets canceled.
**Jdawson**: Like, do you guys understand that if something were to happen and our policy is canceled, we will go out of business?
**Jdawson**: Like everybody on, like, you guys have to figure this out.
**Jdawson**: Like, this, this can't happen.
**Jdawson**: It's not like we can't afford it.
**Jdawson**: Like, this has to be paid.
**Jdawson**: Like, and it has to be paid promptly.
**Jdawson**: Like, I don't care if you got a certain reminder to call them every quarter to figure it out to confirm that, you know, hey, make sure there's nothing to do, whatever it takes.
**Jdawson**: But it just can't happen again.
**Jdawson**: Like, we will go out of business.
**Jdawson**: We are flirting with disaster.
**Accounting**: Can we pay the whole year?
**Accounting**: Are you okay with just paying the whole year?
**Jdawson**: Absolutely.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Do it every single time.
**Accounting**: We're doing with a lot of our clients, we just pay the whole year a year out and then we just allocated every month.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Accounting**: So that may be literally.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: I've made that emphatically clear.
**Jdawson**: To pay it every year.
**Jdawson**: We don't even have to allocate it because we have a 1.25% insurance rate that we put on every single job.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Accounting**: Oh, by allocation, just on the accountant side just to show the monthly insurance expense.
**Accounting**: So we pay the whole year in one month and then every month we expense it out.
**Accounting**: So that's fine.
**Jdawson**: I want to make sure that every single one of our policies gets paid a year out and they cannot lapse again.
**Jdawson**: Like, this just can't happen.
**Justin**: Should I buy the check that I prepared today?
**Justin**: That is for 13,000 only.
**Justin**: The Jew on last May 27th.
**Accounting**: No, just leave that one.
**Accounting**: Leave, leave that one.
**Accounting**: That one can, can go out.
**Accounting**: We'll, we'll make an additional entry for the remaining months on the policy.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we need, Yeah, I mean, we need to get this.
**Jdawson**: I mean, because right now it's cancelled.
**Jdawson**: I mean, you know, we're.
**Jdawson**: When we got work going on, like, we need to get this active immediately.
**Jdawson**: Like, I, I mean, we printed a check.
**Jdawson**: Is there a way to, to, to pay this direct today instead of waiting for that check to hit them?
**Jdawson**: I mean, that's a week of processing.
**Accounting**: If they.
**Accounting**: I mean, I'll, I'll call Lisa.
**Accounting**: If they can accept, accept a W.
**Accounting**: We can process a W out of, out of the bank account.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I mean, usually you could pay it, pay it with an E check or something like.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I mean this, you know, they've got a, a billing here, Cincinnati billing at.
**Jdawson**: @ sin fin.
**Jdawson**: Like you can email them or call them or something.
**Jdawson**: But.
**Jdawson**: But yeah, get it re paid and reinstated and then, and then, yeah, pay the, you know, whatever.
**Jdawson**: The 72,000 for the year and let's.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah, like 100.
**Jdawson**: I mean, this is.
**Jdawson**: Again, this is a big deal.
**Accounting**: So are those the only, the only two policies?
**Jdawson**: No, we have other policies.
**Jdawson**: We should have a.
**Jdawson**: Maria, you have a list of all our policies?
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Fnjie**: See, everything else in notion, we have all the policies listed there.
**Jdawson**: So go through and double check all of our policies and I mean, like, what.
**Jdawson**: Get them all paid to where they're up, you know, paid for the whole year and then Set reminders, whatever it is to be.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: Like when this is going to be due every quarter or whatever that is to where we don't miss this.
**Jdawson**: I mean I.
**Jdawson**: I can't.
**Jdawson**: I can't tell you enough like what destroys construction companies.
**Jdawson**: And this is it.
**Fnjie**: Links also accounting for the insurances.
**Fnjie**: They are.
**Fnjie**: They also have reminders but I'm just gonna send that to you guys.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Accounting**: The reminders are coming in Notion.
**Fnjie**: Yes, the reminders are coming in Notion and they're tagging accounting.
**Fnjie**: I'll send the links to you.
**Jdawson**: Set up.
**Jdawson**: Set up like a calendar thing like just like we would have on any other counter invite.
**Jdawson**: Like make it.
**Jdawson**: Make it stupid proof like a calendar reminder every quarter.
**Jdawson**: Put notes in there.
**Jdawson**: Whatever it takes so that this is front of mind.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: Jose, how are we doing on the reconciliation?
**Jmendez**: We have working in live and we have I think around 80% complete because we had to before with the OFX form but now we have fixed it and I have made the upload into acumatica and just waiting and confirmation for Ashley from Ashley and related to what I can see the transaction to be matched.
**Jmendez**: That is only the point that is pending.
**Jmendez**: But I think once this should be fixed we could get the.
**Jmendez**: The whole process.
**Jdawson**: And what are we waiting for to get that fixed exactly?
**Jmendez**: Oh yeah, I need to confirmation from Ashley because maybe something we are missing.
**Jmendez**: But we'll wait for.
**Jmendez**: I will hear it again because I sent.
**Jmendez**: I sent her an email just to review the upload.
**Jmendez**: Maybe something is missing.
**Jmendez**: But that is the point at this moment.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: So you're waiting on her to respond.
**Jdawson**: So moving forward, Jose, like if we're going back and forth like that like.
**Jdawson**: Like this.
**Jdawson**: Try to just set up a teams meeting and walk through it together if you.
**Jdawson**: It may be easier.
**Jmendez**: Yeah, okay.
**Jmendez**: Yeah, right.
**Jmendez**: You are right.
**Accounting**: And just to go ahead, I was gonna give you an update on our end for the month.
**Accounting**: Month end stuff we were missing.
**Accounting**: We started reconciling.
**Accounting**: There were a couple of missing transactions in Notion from the time we started importing which was the beginning of.
**Accounting**: Of the year.
**Accounting**: Those have been added and tagged to the approvers.
**Accounting**: I am.
**Accounting**: I'm sending some stuff back because it has.
**Accounting**: I have a bunch of transactions that have job codes but no.
**Accounting**: No cost codes.
**Accounting**: So we can't export those.
**Jdawson**: So we have a non project code and so I don't know.
**Jdawson**: I'll have to look.
**Jdawson**: Maria, like look in our database.
**Jdawson**: So we should.
**Jdawson**: In the Notion database there should be where it has right now it pulls from the jobs.
**Jdawson**: Should be able to add something that says non project code.
**Jdawson**: That's what we have in Acumatica.
**Jdawson**: So for instance, like certain things are not going to have it.
**Jdawson**: Like for instance a lot of that furniture and all that stuff that we bought for the Tampa office.
**Jdawson**: I mean at some point like some of that stuff is like we're not going to code it through a job.
**Jdawson**: It's just going to hit so it can hit overhead as a non project code.
**Jdawson**: Just like office supplies for here or indie or wherever.
**Jdawson**: So go into notion if you would and add that non project code so it matches what's in Acumatica so that it can export accordingly.
**Jdawson**: And make sure you work with Jose on that so that you guys are on the same page.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Accounting**: 25 101, that is the new job, right?
**Accounting**: That is uniqlo.
**Jdawson**: I mean 25101.
**Jdawson**: I don't know what job that is.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: I said 105.
**Accounting**: Oh, 25.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Accounting**: A bunch here that have 25.
**Jdawson**: 25101 is core mark.
**Accounting**: It's core mark.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, 25105 is applied engineering.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Accounting**: So 25101.
**Accounting**: There's a bunch of items in here charged to 25101 with no Costcod.
**Accounting**: So those are the ones I'm sending back.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, those are, those are my.
**Jdawson**: That's my fault.
**Jdawson**: I just, I.
**Jdawson**: I ran out of time.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: I was, I was going through coding a bunch of stuff and so.
**Jdawson**: Yes, that's fine.
**Jdawson**: I will get those coded.
**Accounting**: That's fine.
**Accounting**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Any other questions for me.
**Justin**: Regarding the payroll related sync to Job Planner?
**Justin**: It's already sorted out.
**Justin**: So I matched.
**Justin**: Yeah, I matched the cost that has been posted in Akumatica vs job planner.
**Justin**: So it's now matching.
**Justin**: And another one is relating to the vendor that has been created from the Job Planner to Acumatica.
**Justin**: We still have of those vendors that I've sent, it duplicates the vendor that we have already added in Akumatica and then the commitment is synced to that vendor.
**Justin**: So I am already working with Job Planner and then we will be deleting some of the commitments that has been synced with a new vendor and then we are correcting it.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So you're saying we've got people are entering them and we're getting duplicates.
**Justin**: Yes, yes.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Now a lot of times you can link like those and combine it.
**Jdawson**: Can you not do that?
**Justin**: Usually what happened is it when they are syncing a commitment, I think it created A new vendor, which remember Fatima, that we have that vendor code.
**Justin**: The number.
**Justin**: The number.
**Accounting**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: When it creates a new vendor in Job Planner it sends it to Acumatica and creates a new vendor in Acumatica too.
**Accounting**: So we it's unable to sync, sync, sync the two.
**Accounting**: So I think Job Planner can do it on their end and just delete the one that automatically created out of job planning.
**Jdawson**: How do we prevent that from happening in the future?
**Accounting**: They just have to email us when they have a new vendor.
**Accounting**: I think rather than trying to set it up on their own.
**Jdawson**: That's a lot.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Justin**: What I was thinking is maybe we can send the list of the vendor because I think when they are approving the commitment in a job planner, they have to enter the vendor code.
**Justin**: I think that's their option.
**Justin**: So when they do not know the vendor code, they just input or they created new coding for that.
**Jdawson**: What if we do this?
**Jdawson**: What if we.
**Jdawson**: If there was a way to lock Job Planner to where you cannot set up a new vendor.
**Jdawson**: You can only, it can only pull from Acumatica new new vendor.
**Jdawson**: Then they email accounting and say hey, ABC contracting needs set up.
**Jdawson**: Here's their W9.
**Jdawson**: And then exactly like what we do with Procore.
**Justin**: Yeah, we'll ask Kristen regarding that one.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, let's see if we can do that.
**Jdawson**: Like, like they like new vendors.
**Jdawson**: New companies can only come from Acumatica.
**Jdawson**: But as far as adding people contacts to companies, you they can still do that.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So put that on your list.
**Jdawson**: Reach out to Job Planner.
**Jdawson**: Let's see what that option is.
**Jdawson**: And if they say no, then let them know, here's our issue.
**Jdawson**: How do we prevent this and see what they can come up with.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Anything else.
**Accounting**: Jesse?
**Accounting**: Regarding that invoice for cybercoders, I think the issue, the issue accountant is having is like the, the cost code is related to payroll.
**Accounting**: So it has a account code linked, linked to the.
**Accounting**: The budget.
**Accounting**: So when accountant tries to process the invoice as an expense, Acumatica is giving us an error because the job code, the cost code you provided is the project management code which should only have, you know, payroll related items.
**Accounting**: This is not payroll.
**Bclymer**: Which job?
**Accounting**: 25, 105, I believe.
**Jdawson**: Let me double check.
**Accounting**: Is it 25, 105?
**Jdawson**: No, that's, that's a party engineering.
**Jdawson**: It's, it's the.
**Jdawson**: It's probably going to Uniqlo for Keva.
**Bclymer**: Yes, it was 25 105.
**Bclymer**: You know, I just allocate an hour of my time a day or Whatever.
**Bclymer**: For my overall time.
**Jdawson**: She's talking about the cyber coders invoice.
**Jdawson**: The $17,000, because that.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, so that's an expense.
**Bclymer**: And we only have the labor code, so we'll just need to create a expense code, I guess.
**Accounting**: Expense code?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, Project manager.
**Jdawson**: Okay, well, or.
**Jdawson**: Or I would say, I think we have a.
**Jdawson**: Another cost code you could put it for under, like, recruitment or fees or something.
**Jdawson**: But.
**Jmendez**: I just.
**Jdawson**: I think if you code it to the PM line item, it's.
**Jdawson**: I mean, it's gonna.
**Jdawson**: We know what it is, I guess, but it's gonna skew it quite a bit.
**Accounting**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: All right, what else we got?
**Jdawson**: Anything?
**Accounting**: That's it for me.
**Accounting**: Unless anybody else has anything for me.
**Justin**: That's all for the end.
**Jmendez**: Yeah.
**Jmendez**: Yeah, me too.
**Fnjie**: Okay, I'm gonna call you.
**Fnjie**: I'm gonna call you soon so we can set up that no code on Notion.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: For no code related to no projects.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: I was looking at some of the codes.
**Fnjie**: There's already some of them.
**Fnjie**: Sorry.
**Jdawson**: Non project code is what it is.
**Fnjie**: Non project codes.
**Fnjie**: Yeah, there's already one call.
**Fnjie**: Office supplies and everything.
**Fnjie**: But just go through.
**Fnjie**: We'll go through those.
**Fnjie**: And then Fatima and Fritz, I send you the.
**Fnjie**: All the insurance policies that we have in Notion, so.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Accounting**: There you go.
**Fnjie**: Let me know if you guys need anything else, okay?
**Fnjie**: All right.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Accounting**: All right.
**Accounting**: Thank you.
**Fnjie**: Thank you, guys.
**Jmendez**: Okay.
**Jmendez**: Thank you.
**Jdawson**: Thanks.
**Accounting**: Thank you.
