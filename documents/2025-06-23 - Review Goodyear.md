## Transcript
**Acannon**: So I'm trying to push him right now.
**Acannon**: And then the other framer gave me the labor and he's giving me the material.
**Acannon**: He just said hang on and he's going to send it back any minute.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Acannon**: And then I just forwarded you all the MEP numbers I got.
**Acannon**: I haven't had a chance to look at any of them yet.
**Acannon**: I just wanted to get them to you.
**Bclymer**: Well, what in the world his H Vac number was like $3.7 million for.
**Acannon**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Was he.
**Bclymer**: Was he pricing the work on the, like the new drawings, putting roof units everywhere?
**Acannon**: I think he was pricing off of the ex.
**Acannon**: The old drawings?
**Acannon**: Well, yeah, I mean, I was talking through everything with him on the phone.
**Acannon**: It sounded like he had everything figured out.
**Acannon**: And apparently Henry wasn't getting that information.
**Acannon**: Okay, so I can probably get a quick per RTU price because we're only doing what, four or five?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, four, maybe five, max.
**Bclymer**: One, two.
**Bclymer**: Really?
**Bclymer**: Four, probably.
**Bclymer**: Well, I looked at his plumbing number.
**Bclymer**: It's double what the other guy's number is.
**Acannon**: I saw that too.
**Bclymer**: Like everything along the line is lighting.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, 600 gram more like what was he provide?
**Bclymer**: Like, does he.
**Bclymer**: So his two numbers here.
**Acannon**: And then there's too many splits.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, one mini split.
**Acannon**: Oh, just the one for the guard shack.
**Bclymer**: Oh, two.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, you're right.
**Bclymer**: Guard shack and then the IT closet.
**Acannon**: And those are 25 tons.
**Acannon**: RTUS.
**Acannon**: Don't remember where I saw that spec.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I think we were just guessing 20 tons.
**Jremillard**: I thought we were going a little.
**Bclymer**: Smaller, like 20 ton.
**Bclymer**: So he's thinking it's 2400 for bay lights.
**Bclymer**: We were guessing 2200.
**Acannon**: And I think he was trying to follow the existing lighting layout conduit.
**Bclymer**: So he's got two quotes here.
**Bclymer**: This refrigeration.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Breakdown for the lighting installation.
**Bclymer**: So he's got one here that says 2400 4K lights, 202x2 LED lights in the remodeled office areas.
**Bclymer**: He's got this 4.6 million.
**Acannon**: Yeah, I'm looking at the same one.
**Bclymer**: Then he's got another one.
**Bclymer**: It says.
**Acannon**: The charging station.
**Bclymer**: Charging stations and big ass fans.
**Bclymer**: Installation, conveyor system and control panels.
**Bclymer**: Scrubber Power Connections 2.9.
**Bclymer**: And then for the dock stations, 1.862.
**Bclymer**: Do you have the estimate pulled up, Jesse?
**Acannon**: Yeah.
**Acannon**: You're still on the second one, right?
**Acannon**: The charging station one?
**Acannon**: Yeah, yeah, I think I'm where you're at on it down to the scope of work.
**Bclymer**: Well, I mean the, you know, our full estimate, the one we're gonna that we're filling out.
**Acannon**: Huh?
**Bclymer**: This is the only electrician we got or.
**Bclymer**: Andrew, did those other two guys give you any feedback?
**Jremillard**: Are we talking about Switch and Hawkeye?
**Jremillard**: Yeah, they never answered.
**Jremillard**: I haven't been able to call them today.
**Acannon**: I have a feeling Hawkeye is going to be out just because of scheduling.
**Bclymer**: But if can.
**Bclymer**: Can.
**Bclymer**: Jesse, can you pull up our Excel spreadsheet for the estimate?
**Acannon**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And share it.
**Bclymer**: Can you call him up about the H Vac and just tell them, hey, this is just.
**Bclymer**: I just need four rooftop units.
**Bclymer**: Four 20 ton rooftop units.
**Acannon**: Yeah, I already got that written down.
**Acannon**: And then the too many splits.
**Bclymer**: But do you want to call him now and then he can look at that while we're going through the rest of this?
**Acannon**: Yep.
**Acannon**: I'll just shoot him a text.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Sa.
**Bclymer**: They got a pile of steel outside.
**Bclymer**: Andrew.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, it's been a.
**Jremillard**: It's been a day getting delivered though.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, well, you're just lucky it's not a muddy muck hole out there.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, 96 out right now.
**Bclymer**: That's nothing, Cassidy.
**Bclymer**: It's probably 115 where you're at.
**Acannon**: It's only 92.
**Acannon**: Zero today.
**Bclymer**: Really?
**Acannon**: But it's only 11:30.
**Acannon**: Wait till 2:00.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, I'll take the non humid and thick heat.
**Jremillard**: 115.
**Jremillard**: Still 115.
**Jremillard**: But yeah, our UV got up to 11 today.
**Bclymer**: What?
**Jremillard**: Because we bombed those sons of.
**Acannon**: Yeah, they didn't around over the weekend.
**Acannon**: It was warheads on foreheads.
**Bclymer**: Oh, I know.
**Bclymer**: What a glorious day.
**Bclymer**: What's funny is I'm watching the news and it's like just in some.
**Bclymer**: Whatever B2 bombers just took off.
**Bclymer**: They're headed to Guam somewhere five minutes later.
**Bclymer**: Well, they just confirmed they bombed the shit out of Iran.
**Bclymer**: That is so cool.
**Bclymer**: Like fool all those people, they dropped.
**Acannon**: 14 of those 15,000 pounders.
**Jremillard**: Oh, they just got six of them.
**Jremillard**: They just shot six police ballistic missiles that are are at a American base in Qatar and none of them.
**Jremillard**: And none of them hit.
**Jremillard**: And they said they just wanted to have the last punch essentially in the fight.
**Jremillard**: And they don't want to drag us along.
**Acannon**: I have a feeling they're gonna be a glass nation pretty quick.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: Trump just needs to send a picture of the dude's house to him guy.
**Acannon**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Acannon**: So I got Heath working on that and then I got the two framers.
**Acannon**: The guy who's dragging his feet is the guy who's giving the drywall and paint numbers on top of his framing number.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So if we can start at the top.
**Bclymer**: We'll just run through these all real quick.
**Bclymer**: So we know the demo concrete for new docs.
**Bclymer**: We got the guys.
**Acannon**: Yeah, they're working on that.
**Bclymer**: But he put it in his quote, pretty sure.
**Acannon**: Oh, for the demo.
**Acannon**: Yeah, the new concrete is what's coming in on it.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So like that now goes down instead of 280.
**Bclymer**: If we put 180 in there, we'd have plenty of extras.
**Bclymer**: Use like 98 I think.
**Acannon**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And then pour back.
**Bclymer**: He's getting to us.
**Acannon**: Yep.
**Acannon**: They're all supposed to be including that.
**Jremillard**: Were those verbal numbers or did he send that in a document?
**Acannon**: That was on a document.
**Bclymer**: It's in his quote.
**Bclymer**: Look at his latest quote.
**Acannon**: Thursday or Friday.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: I said see it.
**Jremillard**: I haven't seen it yet and it's not in a folder.
**Jremillard**: So I'll get that put in the folder now.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: You never saw the email or what.
**Jremillard**: Email?
**Bclymer**: Well, he copied you on it, so I'm gonna forward it to you right now.
**Acannon**: Andrew, that download of the drive also failed.
**Jremillard**: I don't remember it taking that long.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, we just need to do like a hour long get.
**Jremillard**: Have a meeting of just going back over your computer because we never got to do that.
**Acannon**: Yeah, that's fine.
**Acannon**: It'll just have to be a little later in the week.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, that works better for me.
**Bclymer**: Where's his quote?
**Bclymer**: Someone sent one that had the concrete in there.
**Acannon**: Was it Freddy Blankenships or Jeff?
**Acannon**: Ditto, I think was the guy who sent it.
**Acannon**: But he sent it to my.
**Acannon**: He sent it to my college email.
**Acannon**: So I haven't had time to forward it.
**Acannon**: I just saw that like an hour or two ago.
**Acannon**: And then just so you know, I put in for next Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday off.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so.
**Acannon**: If I get it, that'll help.
**Bclymer**: Here it is.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I just sent it to you and me, Andrew.
**Jremillard**: Now that you say the name Jesse, I remember seeing that Jeff guy.
**Bclymer**: There's 91,245 for the demo.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so then concrete.
**Bclymer**: Let's see how much that comes in at.
**Jremillard**: This estimate since he has demo in it.
**Jremillard**: Do you want me to say, do you want me to create or save this in multiple divisions of that bid response folder?
**Jremillard**: Or do you just want it in the equipment?
**Bclymer**: Just put it in the.
**Bclymer**: Put it in the equipment.
**Bclymer**: Put just in the title put includes demo concrete or something.
**Acannon**: Then Jesse, I wanted to ask you for some of this smaller stuff, you know, like the Division 10 type stuff.
**Acannon**: Are we pushing hard to get bidders for that to Submit this Friday or do we have a little more time on those ones since we're using budget numbers?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, we're gonna have a little more.
**Acannon**: Time, but I still want to keep them on track as if we're trying to get hard bids this week just to keep them from not being too far behind.
**Acannon**: But yeah.
**Bclymer**: So who for concrete, have you.
**Bclymer**: Who have we reached out for a.
**Acannon**: Concrete number for the docs?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Acannon**: Freddie Blankenship, Boyd and that Jeff.
**Acannon**: Ditto, guys.
**Bclymer**: Okay, if you want to scroll down, there is.
**Bclymer**: Is the Freddy and his team going to price up the railing?
**Acannon**: Yeah, they're supposed to be.
**Acannon**: And then I also got budget numbers from the miscellaneous guy.
**Acannon**: He put 115 per lineal foot of that guardrail.
**Bclymer**: Oh, but there's not two.
**Bclymer**: Why'd we put 200ft?
**Bclymer**: There's 886.
**Acannon**: That's the.
**Acannon**: That's the one they bumped up to 1034.
**Acannon**: I think you just have 200 per lineal foot.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, that's what we came up with on what, Friday evening.
**Bclymer**: Oh, yeah.
**Bclymer**: And you're saying a guy quoted it at 115?
**Acannon**: Yeah.
**Acannon**: And that's basic, like industrial guardrail.
**Bclymer**: By the time we paint it.
**Bclymer**: So that's a good budget.
**Acannon**: So you want me to Change this to 115 or leave it?
**Bclymer**: We had painting the guardrail, I think in finishes that way.
**Acannon**: I think so.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: I would.
**Bclymer**: I'd go like 150 if he's got 115.
**Jremillard**: You have Ballard paint.
**Jremillard**: I don't see paint and paint.
**Acannon**: It's.
**Acannon**: There's a touchup loading docks.
**Acannon**: Touch up painted new loading docks.
**Acannon**: Is that where you captured it?
**Jremillard**: I think that was just the dry there.
**Jremillard**: The walls around once they're cutting in.
**Acannon**: Oh, gotcha.
**Bclymer**: So we'll have.
**Bclymer**: We'll have $40 a foot almost to paint it.
**Acannon**: And yeah, I'll double check with them.
**Acannon**: But I told him assume caution.
**Acannon**: Yellow.
**Bclymer**: He's going to provide it in yellow.
**Acannon**: That's what I just told him to assume for a budget number.
**Bclymer**: So his 115including providing it painted already?
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Acannon**: And I'll double check.
**Acannon**: I'll send you guys this.
**Acannon**: So you have it.
**Acannon**: And then we also.
**Acannon**: How did we end up with.
**Acannon**: Where is that?
**Acannon**: Never mind.
**Acannon**: It's got railing's existing storefront.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So 1034ft of that at 150 would be 155,100 instead of the 26 eight.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So woods, there's nothing there.
**Bclymer**: Really?
**Bclymer**: That's fine insulation.
**Bclymer**: The roofer fence sealants Those are all should be.
**Jremillard**: Brandon asked if we only had two electricians listed on the sub list.
**Jremillard**: Looking at this.
**Bclymer**: What's that, Francis?
**Jremillard**: Do we only have the two electricians listed on the sub list?
**Acannon**: Looking at this, I think Dan Amarzo's backed out.
**Acannon**: So then it would be the one.
**Acannon**: The number we just got and then Switch or Hawkeye if you can get a hold of them.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Are you listing Switch and Hawkeye on there so we know which other ones we've contacted?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Acannon**: For the ones I'm adding on there, I'm putting them on when I make contact with them.
**Bclymer**: Okay, well, it looked better on our end if we listed them and then.
**Bclymer**: Okay, call, put in no response or whatever.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, I got it right now.
**Acannon**: Thank you.
**Acannon**: And then the other one.
**Acannon**: That's a no.
**Acannon**: Is that Diamondback Plumbing?
**Bclymer**: Okay, so you the framer that did give you a number?
**Bclymer**: He just had.
**Bclymer**: He didn't have the right size walls?
**Acannon**: No, he gave 18k for 180 lineal feet.
**Acannon**: So he's at 100 bucks millennial foot to framing.
**Acannon**: But I think he's wrong.
**Acannon**: But the guy who's spitting the outer number is that big national framer, so he should be.
**Bclymer**: Was he getting that?
**Acannon**: He's supposed to be texting it to me anytime.
**Acannon**: He texted me $25 for labor and then he said he.
**Acannon**: He was getting me the material number.
**Acannon**: He's just going to assume Doug fur for the wood.
**Bclymer**: Well, they're going to frame this in metal inside the warehouse.
**Bclymer**: Aren't.
**Acannon**: That's one thing I didn't have time to check.
**Acannon**: I was just gonna let him bid it at.
**Bclymer**: I mean, if these walls are 40 foot tall.
**Acannon**: Yeah, there is.
**Acannon**: Where's that?
**Acannon**: Which.
**Acannon**: What's the name of that plan that shows those big tall walls?
**Bclymer**: Well, enlarged office plans.
**Bclymer**: Office plans and new bathrooms.
**Bclymer**: So it's on the.
**Bclymer**: The bid.
**Bclymer**: Like their bidder instructions is where they talked about the wall.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Full height.
**Acannon**: Is that this thing?
**Acannon**: This is.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So if you go to like in these descriptions of work for the existing offices training room interior goes 6 inches above grid.
**Bclymer**: That's existing.
**Bclymer**: Go down to the next one.
**Bclymer**: That's MDF room.
**Acannon**: Then it just goes into the specs.
**Bclymer**: Where's the.
**Bclymer**: Where's the section on the new offices entrance complex?
**Bclymer**: So this is where it says perimeter office wall separating the warehouse and the office will be full height and extend to the bottom of the building roof deck.
**Bclymer**: We finished drywall without paint on the exterior facing side of the wall and above the acoustic ceiling grid on the inside of all these wall.
**Bclymer**: So it's just finished drywall, floor to deck, exterior and interior.
**Acannon**: Where is that?
**Speaker 3**: So.
**Acannon**: That wall they're talking about, the new one that goes to the ceiling in the warehouse, is that going to be right here?
**Bclymer**: Well, now they're saying.
**Bclymer**: Because they said on the existing offices, but we're adding this.
**Bclymer**: You see that interior wall they're adding to make a training room.
**Acannon**: Yeah, right here.
**Bclymer**: No, to the left.
**Bclymer**: To the left.
**Bclymer**: Go left.
**Bclymer**: Like see where they say there's a portable partition?
**Bclymer**: Go, go.
**Bclymer**: No, go.
**Bclymer**: Remember where we walked in the building?
**Acannon**: Yeah.
**Acannon**: I'm trying to put that.
**Bclymer**: You see that?
**Acannon**: Yeah, Right here, Right here.
**Bclymer**: So these walls here just go six inch above ceiling.
**Acannon**: Yeah, these ones.
**Bclymer**: So then if you scroll down that like the.
**Bclymer**: The women's restroom wall, the front of the janitor closet, then going around where the water fountains are, and then going over, across the double doors, around the mother's first aid, over to the dojo room and then towards the back like that is that wall's full height to deck.
**Bclymer**: And then the interior walls are just six inch above ceiling.
**Bclymer**: Again, the bathrooms.
**Acannon**: And so this is just basically.
**Acannon**: This is where that existing room juts out into the warehouse.
**Acannon**: And then this is going to be a new wall that just basically runs the south length of the warehouse and encapsulates that area that's there now in the warehouse into office space.
**Bclymer**: Well, yeah, there's nothing there right now because the wall that.
**Bclymer**: Where those panels were and stuff.
**Acannon**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Is the same wall.
**Bclymer**: We're just building this out.
**Acannon**: Yeah.
**Acannon**: Because right.
**Acannon**: Right here is where we looked at those two conduits that were sticking hanging down.
**Acannon**: There's nothing coming out of them.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Acannon**: Okay.
**Acannon**: And then this is going to be their usual Amazon turn style thingy that they go into the factory area and.
**Bclymer**: We just build infill drywall partition in between there.
**Acannon**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Little turnstiles.
**Acannon**: So really this dojo room east wall is going to be the tall one.
**Acannon**: And then this.
**Bclymer**: Well, they said all perimeter walls if you read that description in their scope.
**Bclymer**: So the entrance complex.
**Bclymer**: So that's this whole complex perimeter.
**Bclymer**: Office walls separating the warehouse and the office will be full height and extend to the bottom of the building roof deck.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: And share my screen here.
**Bclymer**: This goes like.
**Acannon**: Oh, so the green walls are the tall ones.
**Bclymer**: Oh, and they added this.
**Bclymer**: Well, not the green, but just.
**Bclymer**: Just those.
**Acannon**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: That separates the warehouse.
**Bclymer**: Everything else inside of here is just six inches above ceiling.
**Acannon**: Yeah, just the red.
**Acannon**: What you outlined in red is the tall stuff.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Jremillard**: Makes Sense walled it off.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**Acannon**: That's okay.
**Bclymer**: So that.
**Bclymer**: You know.
**Bclymer**: Let's see here.
**Jremillard**: So these electricians need to have their prices backed by wind that I'm reaching out to.
**Acannon**: Our dumpers Friday budget dumpers if they can get them.
**Acannon**: But do you know what time Brandon told the owner?
**Bclymer**: We told him today.
**Bclymer**: We get him a budget.
**Acannon**: Okay.
**Acannon**: No specific time.
**Bclymer**: So Brandon had a meeting at 2:30.
**Bclymer**: That's why I told him we'd get with him after.
**Bclymer**: But wait.
**Jremillard**: I'm reaching out to these three electricians to get us a budget for this whole project by today.
**Bclymer**: But like the budget they're giving us.
**Bclymer**: Is it based on.
**Bclymer**: Are we.
**Bclymer**: Have we clearly given them the scope of work we're looking for?
**Bclymer**: The scope sheet you sent to them.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Jremillard**: These three that I'm reaching out to today have not received anything.
**Bclymer**: But all the ones we've already sent it to, they had the scope sheet.
**Bclymer**: So they knew what their scope was.
**Bclymer**: Correct.
**Jremillard**: Everyone else should have received everything.
**Jremillard**: Correct.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: Hawkeye and Switch.
**Jremillard**: We called on Friday but that was like 6:30 6:45.
**Jremillard**: Our time.
**Jremillard**: And switch had closed at 4:30.
**Jremillard**: And the other one I couldn't get a hold of.
**Jremillard**: That would have been Hawkeye.
**Bclymer**: And they haven't.
**Bclymer**: You haven't called them today?
**Jremillard**: I really have not had a second with what all has been going on site today.
**Bclymer**: Okay, we'll switch back to you.
**Bclymer**: Jesse, let's just go through this and see what the electrical number we have.
**Bclymer**: Which we already know.
**Bclymer**: This plumbing's double what we got another price for.
**Bclymer**: But.
**Acannon**: You want me to share it again?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah, please.
**Bclymer**: So our floor sealer.
**Bclymer**: We're good.
**Bclymer**: That guy's price was a buck fifty.
**Acannon**: You want to leave it at two on here?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And then we had our bath partitions.
**Bclymer**: These are 53 288.
**Bclymer**: What do we have in there?
**Bclymer**: You bump that up 55.
**Bclymer**: 55.
**Bclymer**: 55.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Really very good.
**Bclymer**: What do we have in every chain link fence?
**Jremillard**: We're saying the partitions are almost 2,900 a piece.
**Bclymer**: Keep going down.
**Bclymer**: We got it down in site work.
**Bclymer**: Exterior improvements.
**Bclymer**: Guard check.
**Bclymer**: We had 10.
**Bclymer**: He's at 9500.
**Bclymer**: Parking lot fence.
**Acannon**: He's high on that guard check.
**Acannon**: Because our number I think included the mini split and this budget number.
**Bclymer**: But he didn't include a mini split in it.
**Acannon**: No, that's getting captured in the H Vac.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And then on this plan, trying to find.
**Bclymer**: I had done a.
**Bclymer**: Just a layout of that parking area.
**Bclymer**: See where I saved it.
**Acannon**: I got it.
**Speaker 3**: Hey Andrew, will you.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: Mute yourself and call those electricians real quick.
**Jremillard**: Yeah but so I just want to make sure.
**Jremillard**: I understand.
**Jremillard**: So we want budget numbers for the whole project back by end of day today on.
**Jremillard**: That's what we're wanting out of them.
**Speaker 3**: I mean that's not going to happen.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, that's why I was.
**Jremillard**: I asked.
**Speaker 3**: I mean just call them and see if they've looked.
**Speaker 3**: I mean because you have they.
**Speaker 3**: Have you talked to them before or is anybody.
**Jremillard**: No, the first time those two that I brought up we were talking about late.
**Jremillard**: Late on Friday and they didn't answer.
**Bclymer**: 6:13 folder call me.
**Speaker 3**: Just see how soon they can, you know what they can do to get us numbers back.
**Speaker 3**: How soon they can get it.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: Budget or bid?
**Speaker 3**: Both.
**Speaker 3**: I mean at this point.
**Speaker 3**: Bid, you know because we've already been.
**Speaker 3**: We're gonna have to turn this budget in.
**Speaker 3**: I mean Bill's already texting me.
**Bclymer**: Shoot.
**Bclymer**: His install chain link fence.
**Bclymer**: Was that for the temporary fence on the inside?
**Acannon**: That's for the permanent.
**Bclymer**: Permanent.
**Bclymer**: 30 bucks a foot is all.
**Bclymer**: And that's in the parking lot.
**Acannon**: Yeah.
**Acannon**: For the chain link fence on what you're looking at on my screen.
**Bclymer**: Here's when I got.
**Bclymer**: It's only 200ft.
**Bclymer**: That other gate shown as is that is existing.
**Bclymer**: So that scale, can that be right?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So I mean we had 150 in there but with the gates we 20.
**Bclymer**: I mean if we have 40,000 in our fence budget that's probably plenty.
**Bclymer**: Employee lot fence.
**Bclymer**: Just change that to 40.
**Acannon**: 40K.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: And if we go up to electrical.
**Bclymer**: So this guy for his equipment chargers.
**Bclymer**: Chargers stock electrical.
**Acannon**: 2.98.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, 2.98.
**Bclymer**: He's got the gas fans, lighting's 2.6.
**Bclymer**: Dedicated circuit for various equipment.
**Bclymer**: He's got in his light number.
**Bclymer**: He had all the lights for the offices to which you didn't have Brandon.
**Bclymer**: I think he had 200 fixtures.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, mine was just.
**Speaker 3**: Just the racking area.
**Bclymer**: Just the racking.
**Bclymer**: So he has all pan and so the 400.
**Bclymer**: Like we can change this if we're using his numbers right now.
**Bclymer**: Jesse, go ahead and put for lighting.
**Bclymer**: Open it up here.
**Bclymer**: So he sent.
**Bclymer**: He sent you the 2.6 and then he said.
**Bclymer**: Then he sent another quote.
**Bclymer**: We said the lighting is 4.6.
**Bclymer**: Or did he.
**Bclymer**: Did he send the other one in writing?
**Acannon**: Which, which one are you looking at?
**Acannon**: That's 4.6.
**Acannon**: I see 4.8.
**Bclymer**: Well it's the one he sent today.
**Acannon**: Oh okay.
**Acannon**: I'm on the one from 9:05am.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so he sent you an early one for 2.6.
**Bclymer**: Maybe this typos.
**Bclymer**: That's retarded.
**Bclymer**: And be like $2,000 a light.
**Acannon**: Yeah.
**Acannon**: I think he's got the rest of these lines captured in this number underneath the charging stations for 1.8.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So there's the 1.8 and the 2.95.
**Bclymer**: That includes all power equipment chargers, power to new office scrubber, golf cart, trash compactor, big ass fans.
**Bclymer**: It's got a wire guided line and drivers for mdf, dedicated breakers sa.
**Bclymer**: So I would just change this like change the lighting to 2.6, change the equipment chargers to 2.985 and then power to the remaining 1.862.
**Acannon**: And that's basically.
**Bclymer**: Everything.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, it'll just be included in that number.
**Acannon**: And then what?
**Acannon**: 1.862.
**Bclymer**: 1.862.
**Acannon**: And then these are all zeroed out then.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And who was the other H vac guy you had?
**Acannon**: Bel Air and Diamond Mechanical.
**Acannon**: And there was I think one other one.
**Bclymer**: And so those guys, they know we just need four rooftop units.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And they're going to get you something today.
**Bclymer**: Still trying.
**Acannon**: Yeah, I just, I just talked to Bel air guy about 20 minutes before we got on this call.
**Acannon**: He's going to call me back.
**Acannon**: He's on his way to the office.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And Brandon, your number for the lighting alone was 2.
**Bclymer**: Where is that?
**Speaker 3**: 2, 4.
**Speaker 3**: I think.
**Bclymer**: 2.4.
**Bclymer**: So that, I mean that makes sense.
**Bclymer**: The other 400,000 or no 200,000 would be the office lighting.
**Bclymer**: If you go to the summary page, Jesse.
**Bclymer**: Brandon, this in the total, you know, it's got 600,000 in contingency, 1.3 million in fee.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, it is that.
**Bclymer**: Would you want to leave the contingency in there or get rid of that?
**Speaker 3**: I mean, I say we leave it in there.
**Speaker 3**: I mean it's stated so I mean it's, you know, they can always, you know, take it out.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And one thing, I can't get this guy to call me back.
**Bclymer**: You know the load sharing rep to see how much that would save on the equipment chargers.
**Bclymer**: Such a crap shoe.
**Bclymer**: Because we got, you know, it's.
**Bclymer**: There's Hermes.
**Bclymer**: Hold on a second.
**Bclymer**: Hey, Hermes.
**Bclymer**: Pretty good.
**Bclymer**: You staying cool wherever you are?
**Bclymer**: Oh, yeah.
**Bclymer**: That's for sure.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, right.
**Bclymer**: The ocean breeze.
**Bclymer**: That's right.
**Bclymer**: Okay, one second.
**Bclymer**: I say I want to call.
**Bclymer**: Call with Jesse.
**Bclymer**: Jesse, what time Wednesday would you want to go there so Hermes can line it up with the broker to let you in?
**Acannon**: I I would think early afternoon would be a good time for everybody to be able to make it there.
**Bclymer**: Okay, early afternoon, like one o' clock.
**Acannon**: Perfect.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, all the existing electrical, things like that.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay, sounds good.
**Bclymer**: Appreciate it.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: Okay, perfect.
**Bclymer**: I appreciate it.
**Bclymer**: Thank you.
**Bclymer**: You bet.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Bye.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, he said Wednesday at 1.
**Bclymer**: He says they're signing the lease Wednesday, so.
**Bclymer**: Okay, but he didn't know what time that was going to be yet.
**Acannon**: Is he going to confirm one with you or.
**Acannon**: We, we know we're good for that.
**Bclymer**: Now he's going to shoot it off to the real estate person.
**Bclymer**: So only if they, if they say they can't do it at that time, he said he'd call or email them.
**Bclymer**: Call us, let us know.
**Acannon**: Yeah, as soon as we get confirmation, we're good.
**Acannon**: I'll just send out the invite to all the subs that want to go.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, he said plan on it.
**Acannon**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So I don't know if you scroll up a little just so you can look at the overall budget here, Brandon, but we put 120 in there for design.
**Speaker 3**: Did that, did that architect get back to us?
**Acannon**: Which one?
**Acannon**: The one Vlmk Blmk is supposed to be getting back to me today.
**Acannon**: And then I talked to the other one that I got on Friday this morning and he backed out.
**Speaker 3**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: The exterior improvements, the 117, that's for striping the lot.
**Bclymer**: Basically putting up a hundred or 200 foot of fence with a gate.
**Acannon**: Sorry, what's that?
**Bclymer**: I'm just explaining, Brandon.
**Bclymer**: Kind of a summary of what's in here.
**Bclymer**: So Division 32 is that fence the gate and restrake the parking lot.
**Bclymer**: Okay, scroll up.
**Bclymer**: H vac.
**Bclymer**: Like all we're doing is providing an H vac to the new office spaces.
**Bclymer**: Figuring 4, 20, 25 ton units.
**Bclymer**: The steel should be there, we got the roofing.
**Bclymer**: We put five grand a curb in the roofing number.
**Speaker 3**: What about this seven and a half million dollar electrical number?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, so that's, that's the pricing we got in.
**Bclymer**: So that's includes the lighting, the office power, the microwaves, the.
**Bclymer**: All the other charging equipment that they requested.
**Bclymer**: Now I didn't see on his proposal, he doesn't mention panels.
**Bclymer**: He's got all the dock equipment, all of the, all of the other things listed on the.
**Bclymer**: What they needed.
**Bclymer**: But he doesn't specifically mention added panels.
**Jremillard**: Hawkeye and switch.
**Jremillard**: They're going to be a while.
**Jremillard**: I, I wasn't able to get a hold of anyone, but I talked to Brennan, he's gonna.
**Jremillard**: He can get us a square footage number based on other projects they've done.
**Jremillard**: He can do an electrical.
**Jremillard**: And then he's going to try to get us an H VAC square foot number as well by the end of the day.
**Bclymer**: And he knows it's only the square footage of the office spaces.
**Jremillard**: All I told him was.
**Jremillard**: I see.
**Jremillard**: What.
**Jremillard**: I told him what the area of the.
**Jremillard**: The first floor square footage was.
**Jremillard**: He asked how big the building was.
**Bclymer**: Well, then he's going to think you're putting AC everywhere.
**Bclymer**: It's only the offices.
**Bclymer**: Who's.
**Speaker 3**: Who's Salmon Electric?
**Speaker 3**: Is this the Vegas company?
**Acannon**: Salmon Electric.
**Speaker 3**: S A L M O N Electric contractors.
**Speaker 3**: Aaron Neuberger.
**Acannon**: I don't know who that is.
**Bclymer**: I don't either.
**Speaker 3**: They downloaded the files.
**Jremillard**: Is that from the billing connected thing?
**Jremillard**: Is that the.
**Jremillard**: Is that where they downloaded it?
**Speaker 3**: Yep.
**Jremillard**: I'm.
**Speaker 3**: I'm typing in some companies here that have dialed it.
**Speaker 3**: Call this.
**Speaker 3**: Go into that file.
**Speaker 3**: Go to RM.
**Speaker 3**: You'll see.
**Speaker 3**: I put RMJ Electric.
**Speaker 3**: They downloaded the files on 18.
**Speaker 3**: They've had two people view it, so give them a shot if you would, please, Andrew.
**Jremillard**: Is that in OneDrive?
**Speaker 3**: It's in the.
**Speaker 3**: I'm typing it in right now.
**Speaker 3**: Into the.
**Speaker 3**: Into the Excel sheet.
**Speaker 3**: He doesn't have a number, so you'll have to.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: You have to see if I can buy a phone number for him.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: You set the.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: Let me get all this stuff sent to Brennan, too, so he can get started on that.
**Bclymer**: I'll call them right away.
**Speaker 3**: Okay.
**Acannon**: 35 a foot on framing.
**Acannon**: Jesse.
**Bclymer**: On what?
**Acannon**: Framing.
**Bclymer**: $30 a linear foot.
**Acannon**: Okay, 35.
**Bclymer**: 35.
**Bclymer**: Is that from which.
**Bclymer**: Which blue horseshoe?
**Bclymer**: Brandon, when you're talking about who's looked at it, that's that new estimating platform we're looking at.
**Speaker 3**: Plan.
**Speaker 3**: Plan Hub.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, Plan Hu.
**Bclymer**: It.
**Bclymer**: Our weekly operations meeting just started.
**Jremillard**: So Brad will need what those addendum drawings as well.
**Jremillard**: That's in Job Planner It.
**Bclymer**: Just send in the.
**Bclymer**: The addendum drawings, the scope sheet.
**Jremillard**: And the DD1 set.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I mean, we'll need a.
**Bclymer**: We just need to.
**Bclymer**: I wish I.
**Bclymer**: I can call him and talk him through it so he knows exactly what the price.
**Jremillard**: That addendum only has three pages, right?
**Bclymer**: So everything that we've got is in those two folders for drawings.
**Speaker 3**: Jesse.
**Speaker 3**: I'll just have.
**Speaker 3**: I'll have Maria move the meeting to tomorrow so we can get this done.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: We have the 618 addendum.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Updates.
**Bclymer**: So that's the DD1C.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: Andrew, did you get.
**Bclymer**: You send that?
**Bclymer**: You sent that to Brennan?
**Jremillard**: Yeah, it's loading in right now.
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: It's a full drawing set to load, so someone could respond to that email with it.
**Jremillard**: I sent them through Job Planner, but we can't get it there.
**Jremillard**: Everything else is about to be done.
**Bclymer**: Loading.
**Bclymer**: Did you send him an email or he sent you one?
**Jremillard**: I'm sending him one right now, but I couldn't get the drawings to attach to the email.
**Jremillard**: I got it in Job Planner to send to him, but not the email or he has them at least.
**Bclymer**: SA.
**Jremillard**: Brandon, I got a number for RMJ Electric.
**Jremillard**: Did you call them?
**Speaker 3**: I haven't called him, so go ahead.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: It looks like they're a home.
**Jremillard**: Oh, no, it says industrial on the website.
**Speaker 3**: So I guess, you know, Jesse, you know, I mean, how do we feel about, you know, this.
**Speaker 3**: This number, I mean, and I mean, it seems.
**Speaker 3**: I mean, I always hope that we could get the electrical cover for that, you know, seven and a half easily.
**Speaker 3**: Is everything else, you know, pretty much.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I think this.
**Bclymer**: The guy, Jesse, the guy that priced that electrical, and he talked to him directly about the fact that there's 2,3000amp services.
**Bclymer**: There's the panels that are there.
**Bclymer**: His number includes providing the new panels.
**Acannon**: I did talk to him.
**Acannon**: Yeah.
**Acannon**: Originally, when I talked to him, he knew about the existing electrical.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Acannon**: So the one thing I haven't had time to do yet is look at those quotes he sent this morning I forwarded to you.
**Acannon**: So I guess that would fall into qualifying them as making sure he knows to include all that stuff that it is included.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I mean, it's.
**Bclymer**: It's an awful lot of money.
**Acannon**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So that'd be the only thing like everything else, I mean, I think are good numbers.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Speaker 3**: Well, as long as we have, you know, it clarified then, I mean, that's.
**Speaker 3**: That protects us.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So we need to.
**Speaker 3**: We actually get more numbers than just obviously this one number.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Well, I think.
**Bclymer**: Are we telling Bill, like, you know, we're trying to get a budget for you, and then we're trying to finalize and get everyone dialed in by the end of the week.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, I mean, I'm.
**Speaker 3**: I'm telling him, here's your.
**Speaker 3**: Here's your budget.
**Speaker 3**: I said, you know, my intent is that we're.
**Speaker 3**: We're going to get more numbers in and be able to bring this down a little bit.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: I mean, we got 454,000 in general conditions.
**Speaker 3**: Just need to make sure to.
**Speaker 3**: You update the project Information.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, you know, and we figured on the floors, you know, we were going to do carpet squares in the offices and everything else was sealed concrete.
**Bclymer**: So we'll clarify that.
**Bclymer**: They had like a vinyl luxury tile in the break room.
**Jremillard**: Can't look at anything till tomorrow.
**Jremillard**: Their entire estimating department's out and there's no one else there that can tell me anything.
**Speaker 3**: Okay.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, I mean, we just need to, you know, make sure you got people actually looking at it.
**Bclymer**: She tried to attach Andrew.
**Speaker 3**: It says with bid notes, just share the link.
**Jremillard**: That's what I was.
**Jremillard**: That's what I was trying to do, but it wouldn't even load in the email.
**Bclymer**: Let me try.
**Jremillard**: We just upgraded the WI fi here too.
**Jremillard**: It's still not able to.
**Bclymer**: Okay, see here, so I can start working on this, our clarifications.
**Bclymer**: Okay, I'll start typing that up.
**Bclymer**: Jesse, if you would just follow up with that electrician.
**Bclymer**: Jesse, just.
**Jremillard**: Dawson, can I sit in with you while you do that so I can zero down or become more familiar with all that stuff that's going on at this project?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, you can.
**Bclymer**: It's basically taken from his.
**Jremillard**: Word doc.
**Bclymer**: Well, we're taking his PDF of Scope and then we're clarifying what we're including.
**Bclymer**: So I'll just be going through those two.
**Bclymer**: Is there anyone else we need to that we can call at this point?
**Jremillard**: I'm going to call.
**Jremillard**: I can try calling back.
**Jremillard**: It was either Hawkeye or Twitch.
**Jremillard**: They just said their estimators were out for a while.
**Jremillard**: So I can try calling them back here in an hour so see if they come back they office.
**Jremillard**: But Vernon said he would get back to us.
**Jremillard**: But I can still try them if that's helpful.
**Acannon**: I just got texted that I got to go into the office for a 2 o' clock meeting with an owner.
**Acannon**: So that'll tie me up for a little while, but I'll get a hold of Heath before I go and get back to you.
**Bclymer**: Good.
**Acannon**: Andrew, can you send out an invite for the site meeting at one o' clock on Wednesday?
**Jremillard**: Yes.
**Jremillard**: Do we know who's all attending that?
**Jremillard**: I don't know the list there.
**Acannon**: Yeah, it's the ones in the email I sent Jesse, but you might as well just put everyone on there and then I can go through it with you once you got them all in there if you want, but.
**Acannon**: Okay, it's pretty much going to be everyone.
**Jremillard**: That was 1pm on said Wednesday or Tuesday.
**Jremillard**: Wednesday.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Acannon**: And then I'll block my calendar off on the other place for the whole Afternoon so I can be there with everybody.
**Speaker 3**: Perfect.
**Speaker 3**: All right, I'm gonna try to call some of these subs and see if we get some people looking at it.
**Bclymer**: Good.
**Acannon**: Thank you.
**Acannon**: And then, Jesse, I'll email you an update at the end of the day again.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: What time, Brandon, are you wanting to turn this into to Bill?
**Jremillard**: He just jumped off.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right, well, just text me when you get done with that meeting, Jesse, and.
**Acannon**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Let you know where we're at.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Or give me a call.
**Acannon**: Is Bill in Texas?
**Bclymer**: I'm not sure where he's at.
**Bclymer**: I think he's east coast maybe.
**Acannon**: Okay.
**Acannon**: Because that's going to plan on when we send it to him time wise.
**Acannon**: If 5 o' clock here is 8 o' clock there.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, it's already 4 o' clock.
**Bclymer**: So let me get to typing on this thing.
**Acannon**: Okay, I'll get a hold of Heath right now and then I'll text you when I get out that meeting.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right, see you, Jesse.
**Acannon**: Thanks, guys.
**Jremillard**: I'll hang on with you for a little bit.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: I'm gonna go look at those foundation footers that just got poured and I'll be right back in so three minutes.
**Jremillard**: Wow.
**Jremillard**: Been a heck of a past week and a half for us.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: One more steel clipper.
**Bclymer**: What happened?
**Bclymer**: One more delivery?
**Jremillard**: Yeah, we're just waiting on one more truck.
**Bclymer**: A lot of steel.
**Bclymer**: They get their crane set up?
**Jremillard**: Yeah, it was delivered.
**Jremillard**: Are you in the clarifications template?
**Bclymer**: Okay, so let's get this here, make.
**Jremillard**: It this title, address and everything for you.
**Bclymer**: You're working on the estimate now.
**Jremillard**: The.
**Jremillard**: On the clarifications template that's on our.
**Jremillard**: It still says third shot pickleball caramel.
**Jremillard**: So I'm just going to get that and address cleaned up.
**Jremillard**: Watching stuff.
**Bclymer**: Up here.
**Bclymer**: Demo.
**Jremillard**: Are you reading the bid package for some.
**Jremillard**: Could be your bid package for subcontractors.
**Jremillard**: Reading through that and then I guess there's probably multiple things we're looking at.
**Bclymer**: I'm just looking through our quote first.
**Jremillard**: Demos.
**Jremillard**: Concrete for plumbing.
**Jremillard**: They don't put any of the lighting in this.
**Jremillard**: Right.
**Jremillard**: Because they wanted the lighting separate.
**Bclymer**: What are you saying?
**Jremillard**: Didn't they.
**Jremillard**: Didn't they want the lighting package completely separate from this?
**Jremillard**: Is that right?
**Jremillard**: So we won't put any of the light demo.
**Bclymer**: We had light demo in there.
**Jremillard**: I thought Hermes was adamant about not having lights.
**Bclymer**: How many bollards are on the latest plan?
**Bclymer**: How many dock levelers and how many bollards are on the latest plan?
**Bclymer**: You could look at that that latest set of drawings, they give all these quantities Sa did you find the doc leveler info looking for.
**Jremillard**: Is that in the addendum set in.
**Bclymer**: The addendum, there's a chart on a drawing.
**Bclymer**: I think it's called equipment.
**Bclymer**: And shows you the quantities of guardrail, the dock lights, the dock levelers, the bollards.
**Jremillard**: 70 bollards protect fire risers.
**Bclymer**: So you got to add all of that.
**Jremillard**: You never see in this document.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, that's the first time I'm seeing this.
**Jremillard**: What am I adding up?
**Jremillard**: I only see one line with where it talks about volume dollars.
**Bclymer**: What's that?
**Jremillard**: You said you you wanted me to add something up.
**Bclymer**: Well, it should tell you on there 78.
**Bclymer**: The total.
**Bclymer**: It gives you the total.
**Bclymer**: Like share with me what you're looking at.
**Jremillard**: It says 70.
**Jremillard**: 70 bollards under building exterior specs provide and install $70 to protect fire risers.
**Bclymer**: Show me what you share with your me your screen.
**Bclymer**: No, you got to open the plans up.
**Bclymer**: The addendum drawings.
**Bclymer**: It's on one of those sheets.
**Bclymer**: It's one of those three drawings.
**Bclymer**: Is it not opening?
**Jremillard**: No, it's not synced.
**Bclymer**: S.A.
**Bclymer**: see here.
**Bclymer**: So right here, bollards.
**Bclymer**: Three inch bollards for risers.
**Bclymer**: Quantity 11.
**Bclymer**: It says nine sets of seven.
**Bclymer**: One set of three, one set of four.
**Bclymer**: One riser in south driver entrance.
**Bclymer**: This is number six.
**Jremillard**: That's.
**Bclymer**: So there's a six.
**Jremillard**: Top left line column.
**Jremillard**: Line four.
**Bclymer**: Six.
**Bclymer**: There's ones around there.
**Bclymer**: So that's what I'm saying is like I think he's just a little off on this.
**Bclymer**: But if you take this, nine times seven is 63.
**Bclymer**: Plus three is 70.
**Bclymer**: Plus four is 74.
**Bclymer**: Plus one is 75.
**Jremillard**: That's 71 total.
**Jremillard**: You did your math wrong.
**Bclymer**: Nine times seven is 63.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Plus three plus three.
**Bclymer**: 66.
**Bclymer**: Plus four.
**Jremillard**: 70.
**Bclymer**: Plus one.
**Jremillard**: 71.
**Jremillard**: You added.
**Jremillard**: You went from 63 to 70.
**Bclymer**: So there's 71.
**Bclymer**: 71.
**Bclymer**: 71 in Pollards.
**Bclymer**: So on that same sheet says existing pit levelers, 22 existing trailer fans, 30 new pit levelers, 56.
**Bclymer**: So we have 56 new dock levelers.
**Bclymer**: Demo for new plumbing connections.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: Then to email Heath piles the info on the needed panels.
**Bclymer**: What?
**Jremillard**: Jesse asked if I can email Heath the info on the needed panels.
**Bclymer**: Info on the needed panels?
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Well, so we can send them the existing drawings.
**Bclymer**: Like just send them the sheet with the existing electrical one line, which is sa.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: You're saying there's a panel.
**Jremillard**: Oh, I think I found it.
**Bclymer**: Just need to see which one of these is it.
**Bclymer**: So yeah, this is E601E002.
**Bclymer**: These are the two existing switch gear.
**Bclymer**: Oh no, that's new.
**Bclymer**: Sorry.
**Jremillard**: As I said, that's not an existing.
**Jremillard**: I think it's E601.
**Jremillard**: I just can't get the page to.
**Bclymer**: Mode.
**Jremillard**: Panel wall HP1 panel WA HHP1 panel.
**Jremillard**: Eahhp.
**Jremillard**: By chance.
**Bclymer**: E.
**Jremillard**: Is E601.
**Bclymer**: Well E501 is the one line drawing shows existing.
**Bclymer**: E501 and 502 are the two existing one lines.
**Bclymer**: And then E601 E602.
**Bclymer**: 601 and 602 are the existing panels.
**Jremillard**: I will send them 501.
**Jremillard**: 502.
**Bclymer**: 601.
**Jremillard**: 602.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: You guys doing all right out there?
**Jremillard**: Oh, it's cooking.
**Jremillard**: It's hot out there.
**Jremillard**: It's hot.
**Jremillard**: Better than rain.
**Jremillard**: I wouldn't mind some rain right now.
**Jremillard**: We don't use that word anymore on this site.
**Bclymer**: Well, hopefully.
**Bclymer**: What did that scope letter say about side lights and their bidders instructions?
**Bclymer**: Which doors get the side lights?
**Bclymer**: Know.
**Jremillard**: I know.
**Jremillard**: I just read that.
**Jremillard**: Guessing it's office.
**Jremillard**: I think it was offices.
**Jremillard**: I want to be able to see into the office that needed them as well.
**Bclymer**: Huh.
**Jremillard**: Is that in the addendum?
**Bclymer**: Well, it should be in the instructions.
**Bclymer**: The bidders.
**Bclymer**: I'll share the screen.
**Jremillard**: All these documents are very confused on the purpose of each one.
**Bclymer**: There's only two folders.
**Bclymer**: We got drawings.
**Bclymer**: First set of plans we had.
**Jremillard**: First.
**Jremillard**: It's the first one, right?
**Jremillard**: The 6.
**Jremillard**: 7 with bid notes.
**Jremillard**: There's two other with bid notes.
**Jremillard**: Oh, reduced 1 and 2.
**Jremillard**: I'm going to get rid of those.
**Jremillard**: Just make it confusing.
**Bclymer**: Goodyear bid package.
**Bclymer**: My conference room doors are to receive sidelights.
**Bclymer**: So we have.
**Bclymer**: How many conference rooms do we have?
**Bclymer**: If you're looking at the drawings, just look at them in job planner.
**Bclymer**: They pop right up.
**Jremillard**: Everything is slow right now.
**Bclymer**: The Iranians, it's their.
**Jremillard**: It's so funny.
**Jremillard**: They shot 14 rockets at us, 13 we intercepted and one they didn't even go after because it wasn't even going to come close to us.
**Bclymer**: What were they shooting?
**Jremillard**: Them at our military bases overseas.
**Bclymer**: Really?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Those people.
**Jremillard**: Iran government told us they were doing.
**Bclymer**: It.
**Jremillard**: Which I don't understand.
**Jremillard**: There are office plans and new bathrooms.
**Jremillard**: Or do I want overall.
**Bclymer**: How many conference rooms are there?
**Jremillard**: See one account one.
**Bclymer**: This one.
**Jremillard**: I'm looking at the enlarged office plan and I see one conference room.
**Jremillard**: But is this not considered an office or a conference room?
**Bclymer**: I'LL scroll in.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: See how they drew in a little side light at that door?
**Jremillard**: Yeah, right here.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And then is there any other conference rooms in there?
**Bclymer**: Just look at.
**Bclymer**: So there's two doors going into that room.
**Jremillard**: Isn't that a closet though?
**Bclymer**: Is that an existing door?
**Bclymer**: That's not a new door though.
**Bclymer**: Only the black wall is a new wall.
**Jremillard**: This is a sidelight here.
**Bclymer**: And then down below.
**Bclymer**: So is that two total?
**Jremillard**: That'd be three.
**Bclymer**: That's an existing door.
**Bclymer**: Is the wall white or is it black?
**Jremillard**: So one here, two here and.
**Bclymer**: Are you even listening to me?
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: Black is new, white is.
**Jremillard**: Is existing.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so there's two so far.
**Jremillard**: Correct.
**Bclymer**: Now go on to the other new office areas.
**Bclymer**: Do any of them have a little side light on?
**Bclymer**: Are you moving around?
**Bclymer**: I can hear you, but your page isn't moving.
**Jremillard**: My page is what?
**Bclymer**: Your page isn't moving if you're scrolling around trying to find more office doors.
**Jremillard**: I wasn't scrolling.
**Jremillard**: So only if it's black, it's new.
**Speaker 3**: It's just.
**Jremillard**: This is going to sound very dumb, but I want to make sure I completely understand this.
**Jremillard**: This left side here, this is the entire floor plan.
**Jremillard**: Everything to.
**Jremillard**: Or I guess till here is the entire floor plan.
**Jremillard**: Everything to the right is just zoomed in.
**Bclymer**: Or is this.
**Jremillard**: That is still.
**Bclymer**: No, there's.
**Bclymer**: Look at them.
**Bclymer**: Look at.
**Bclymer**: When they describe.
**Bclymer**: You got one, you got two, you got three, four, five and six.
**Bclymer**: There's six.
**Bclymer**: There's six different blow ups there.
**Bclymer**: Add.
**Jremillard**: I just count two.
**Bclymer**: God dang it.
**Bclymer**: All right, I gotta go into this annual review.
**Bclymer**: So anyways, you take a stab at it.
**Bclymer**: Go into this Word document and just on the finishes list, the new dry over new MDF room.
**Bclymer**: All right, I'm gonna have to go.
**Bclymer**: I'll be right back.
**Jremillard**: I'll take a stab.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
