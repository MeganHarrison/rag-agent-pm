## Transcript
**Bclymer**: But you don't have like your system can't remove the nitrates.
**Bclymer**: One second, Glenn.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Sorry about that.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, that's civil contractor.
**Bclymer**: And the storm capture for that warehouse job.
**Gducharme**: Oh, yeah, they're just called a little.
**Bclymer**: Longer than I thought.
**Bclymer**: Getting us a solution.
**Bclymer**: What's happening, Glenn?
**Bclymer**: You look so happy.
**Gducharme**: It's my first review.
**Gducharme**: I don't think I've ever done one of these before.
**Gducharme**: Moving the arm and so you've never had a review?
**Gducharme**: Probably.
**Gducharme**: They don't do them.
**Gducharme**: Well, they were doing.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, I mean, they were doing them.
**Gducharme**: I didn't do mine.
**Gducharme**: I left at that.
**Gducharme**: At that time when they were all going on at the end of the year last year.
**Gducharme**: Gotcha.
**Bclymer**: Well, Brandon knows the army lingo, so I can let him like bring that something.
**Gducharme**: You sure do march good.
**Bclymer**: All right, so for every question you get wrong, we're gonna have you drop and do 20.
**Bclymer**: Are you ready?
**Gducharme**: I can do that.
**Gducharme**: Can you?
**Gducharme**: No, I probably can't.
**Gducharme**: Back in the day, maybe it's 10 questions on here.
**Gducharme**: 200 push ups.
**Bclymer**: A lot.
**Bclymer**: My teacher in school, I was not very good student and they told me I could do whatever I wanted if I could do, I don't know, 300 pushups or 400 pushups in the period of the classroom.
**Bclymer**: And then from then on, I could just do whatever I wanted.
**Bclymer**: So I practiced push ups every night.
**Bclymer**: And I could do it.
**Bclymer**: I could do like 400 push ups in an hour.
**Gducharme**: Damn.
**Bclymer**: It gets tough after you do like if you do sets of 50, and then after you do a couple of those, it's a struggle, but.
**Bclymer**: And then he reneged and said it didn't matter.
**Bclymer**: I had to pay attention in class anyways.
**Gducharme**: What an.
**Bclymer**: But you got in shape at least, right?
**Bclymer**: Okay, so number one, do you feel like you're being compensated appropriately?
**Bclymer**: You said yes.
**Bclymer**: He said, I'm only running one project.
**Bclymer**: But that's not true.
**Bclymer**: You got Bloomington or foundations as well.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, like anything, bigger projects, more experience, you'll make more money.
**Bclymer**: Number two is, have you made any costly mistakes?
**Bclymer**: If so, what are they?
**Bclymer**: You said no getting all questions and budget allocations prior to making decisions.
**Bclymer**: That's good.
**Bclymer**: Number three, have you done things above and beyond your position to save, make the money, company money?
**Bclymer**: If so, what were they?
**Bclymer**: He said no.
**Bclymer**: Aside from finding all the extra money possible during buyout, I have managed money within my role.
**Bclymer**: So yeah, I mean the project manager, that's 50% of your job at least, is the financial well being of a project.
**Bclymer**: So everything you do to getting.
**Bclymer**: Getting things bought out early is, you know, the biggest thing you can do, and that will translate into a good job.
**Bclymer**: So what are you doing?
**Bclymer**: Well, learning and implementing the processes at Alito, managing buyout and finding money.
**Gducharme**: Where are we at on buyout for Westfield?
**Gducharme**: I have a couple things left.
**Gducharme**: There's superiors.
**Gducharme**: That's contract out today.
**Gducharme**: That knocks out framing, drywall, and acoustic tile.
**Gducharme**: I need to finalize painting, and I need J and L.
**Gducharme**: I've been going back and forth with them, just trying to get their scope dialed in.
**Gducharme**: Midwest design was really expensive on everything.
**Gducharme**: So at this point, I'm planning on just getting with jail and working out the final prices on the last of the things in the bathroom accessories on the Yankee painting.
**Gducharme**: I have.
**Gducharme**: I have a few bids, but again, they're not really accurate because they are accounting for things that aren't.
**Gducharme**: So I had to do kind of a scope review and send them back their estimate with markups and say we need to correct it to this.
**Gducharme**: So I have S and M, AAC and then J painting and he's as well.
**Gducharme**: But I don't know if they're gonna get interested in time.
**Gducharme**: They said they needed a couple weeks, so I didn't have that.
**Gducharme**: Excuse me, sir.
**Gducharme**: Weeks ago.
**Gducharme**: What's SNM look like?
**Gducharme**: Usually they're pretty good.
**Gducharme**: They're.
**Gducharme**: They're like 130,000.
**Gducharme**: But again, he had painting a lot of stuff that wasn't called for.
**Gducharme**: Like all of the deck, the mezzanine deck, which he wouldn't paint that.
**Gducharme**: Whoever doesn't spray insulation would end up painting that.
**Gducharme**: A lot of the drywall, like all the kitchens that got taken out, tile instead of paint.
**Gducharme**: So none of that's paint.
**Gducharme**: Half the commissary is not paint.
**Gducharme**: It's frp.
**Gducharme**: So just.
**Gducharme**: Just a lot of things like that.
**Gducharme**: And then one of the.
**Gducharme**: One of the guys at JL didn't have any of the metal or steel on their estimate.
**Gducharme**: So just going through each of these estimates and marking up this is wrong.
**Gducharme**: So do you think we can have buyout done this week?
**Gducharme**: I don't know about all of it, but probably the majority of it, the odds and ends, things like the air curtains.
**Gducharme**: I'm still trying to figure out how we can get those back to closer within our budget.
**Gducharme**: How much are those?
**Gducharme**: 70.
**Gducharme**: $70,000 per.
**Gducharme**: No total.
**Gducharme**: But we only had 21,000 built in.
**Gducharme**: And that was just.
**Gducharme**: We had planned to buy some, but the ones that.
**Gducharme**: The ones that are going to be required for these.
**Gducharme**: But how big they are are, you know, over, over twice the cost of what we have budgeted just for material.
**Gducharme**: So just the units for five years.
**Gducharme**: We have seven budgets for five units is 44 grand.
**Gducharme**: We had seven budgeted at 21,000.
**Gducharme**: So we're way off on that.
**Gducharme**: Unless we can find something that.
**Gducharme**: Are we just doing the air curtains in the food area?
**Gducharme**: Yeah, yeah.
**Gducharme**: One of them will be an ad from the design.
**Gducharme**: I'll get a little bit of money back on that.
**Bclymer**: But like did they get bigger?
**Bclymer**: Did the openings get bigger?
**Bclymer**: Why you say the ones that are, are required?
**Gducharme**: We just plugged a number when we estimated it.
**Gducharme**: Jesse at like I want to say.
**Bclymer**: We put like 15 per that they were like 3500 each or something because like that was online.
**Bclymer**: We had a 10 foot door.
**Bclymer**: So we got a 10 foot air curtain or 11 foot air curtain and they were $3,500.
**Bclymer**: So like what is it that we have?
**Gducharme**: A 12 foot door.
**Gducharme**: So it's now an 11 and a half foot unit to fit in between the tracks.
**Gducharme**: And one that big has an extra blower motor in it.
**Gducharme**: There's a couple other things that are just larger that that he was saying can we get two?
**Gducharme**: I asked him about that.
**Gducharme**: To do two five footers.
**Gducharme**: He was going to look into that.
**Gducharme**: But cost cost wise it'll probably end up being the same to mount two of them.
**Gducharme**: But what about what Jesse was saying?
**Gducharme**: He found some online.
**Gducharme**: There were 3, 500.
**Gducharme**: He said we may have.
**Gducharme**: But he's like you said for a ten foot door that was under a nine foot span.
**Gducharme**: And now this is going up to an 11.
**Gducharme**: It's like 134 inches, 136 inches across.
**Gducharme**: But even if we give it two of the small ones like what he found online, that would be 7,000 each each door.
**Bclymer**: So we're still, we're still twice because.
**Gducharme**: We only have 3,000 each opening.
**Gducharme**: Oh, okay.
**Gducharme**: So we deleted three openings and added one.
**Gducharme**: That one will go to change order.
**Gducharme**: I did write to put the labor of those into fights contract.
**Gducharme**: They sent me a change order for 71,000.
**Gducharme**: I kicked it back and said hey, this is in your contract.
**Gducharme**: I'm going to buy the units.
**Gducharme**: But you know this line on your contract says you guys are installing them and they never replied.
**Gducharme**: So at this point I'm just trying to.
**Gducharme**: They wanted 70,000 to install them.
**Gducharme**: I'm buying these.
**Gducharme**: Your contract says you're gonna, you're gonna buy them or you're gonna install them.
**Gducharme**: They'll be provided by others.
**Gducharme**: That's what they're line.
**Gducharme**: Line 18 of their contract says so.
**Bclymer**: Well, okay, just so we started out, the drawings had five overhead doors going outside.
**Bclymer**: Is that correct?
**Gducharme**: Seven.
**Bclymer**: There was seven overhead doors?
**Gducharme**: Totally three.
**Gducharme**: Three in the volleyball and four in the, in the bar.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, but there's no food in the volleyball.
**Bclymer**: Why are we putting them on the volleyball?
**Gducharme**: We're not.
**Gducharme**: But in your estimate you had seven times 3,000 to equal 21,000.
**Gducharme**: So you had accounted for all seven doors in your estimate for the air curtains.
**Gducharme**: That's where I'm getting that from.
**Bclymer**: Okay, well, we wouldn't have put them on the volleyball side.
**Bclymer**: I don't know where that came from.
**Bclymer**: But you know, if it was a small like 3 footer at the door, they wouldn't do that unless they propped them open.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: And so then you went and looked online and found an air curtain for the size door we needed or did you just ask the sub to go price me up in Eric?
**Gducharme**: Both.
**Gducharme**: I went, I looked online and then I went to Craig Escapes and looked to see what they had.
**Gducharme**: And then I looked up one of the.
**Gducharme**: I think the door contractor, David Biddle sent me burners products.
**Gducharme**: She.
**Gducharme**: So I went through that and found a size that would fit within what we needed.
**Gducharme**: I sent that out and the guy who did the ones at Crate Forests sent me back his estimate saying that his estimate was like 64,000 purchase the five of them.
**Gducharme**: When I asked him why it was so expensive and that was his answer was because it has an extra blower motor.
**Gducharme**: These are like fit.
**Gducharme**: That size is quite a big unit.
**Gducharme**: So twice, twice as much as the cost of the ones we did at Great Escapes.
**Gducharme**: Well, that's, he's looking to see what he lets for me.
**Gducharme**: We'll, we'll table that.
**Gducharme**: We'll, we'll dive into that after that.
**Gducharme**: Let's stay on task for your review here.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: Where can you improve?
**Bclymer**: You said estimating adopting the design build mentality and dictating direction to the design team.
**Gducharme**: So going back to Ford real quick.
**Gducharme**: Jesse, so what, what you said was managing by out finding money.
**Gducharme**: You know, what are you doing?
**Gducharme**: Well, I would, I would say the biggest thing is probably with time like what I mean once we have a job it should be bought in within.
**Gducharme**: Bought out within a month.
**Gducharme**: You know we are.
**Gducharme**: Where are we at three months in on this Westfield now.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, yeah.
**Gducharme**: So I mean like some of this stuff, some of this stuff should.
**Gducharme**: I would think you bought out like now.
**Gducharme**: I understand some things, you know like our interiors, whatnot.
**Gducharme**: We didn't have drawings, but just a general rule of thumb.
**Gducharme**: I don't know if you communicate that to you, but like, we expect a job to be bought out within a month of us getting it.
**Gducharme**: So, yeah, part of that is probably like, I don't know if we gave you that expectation, but just so you know, like, for instance, like the next project that you get, like, that's what we want to see because, you know, for financials.
**Gducharme**: Right.
**Gducharme**: Like a.
**Gducharme**: Know where our gaps are early so we can make up for it and, you know, be for us projecting cash flow and all the bigger things in the company, it's important for us to know within a, you know, reasonable amount of certainty where that job is.
**Bclymer**: I mean, every time I talk about getting a job and buying out, it's a month.
**Bclymer**: That's it should always be our goal.
**Gducharme**: And Jesse, maybe it's a no for us, you know, when we'll bring it up in our next company meeting.
**Gducharme**: But let's make a note to get Maria and add that expectation in the SOPs.
**Gducharme**: If it's not there yet.
**Bclymer**: I'm pretty sure it's there.
**Bclymer**: When is the last time you read the PM job description, Glenn?
**Gducharme**: When we handed it out during our last company house meeting, I took notes on it and I used it for my PSRs for the next two or three months.
**Gducharme**: You know, uniform added, but yeah, I mean, I have, I don't know, 22 or so subcontracts out the rest for Westfield or all the stuff that we've been waiting on.
**Gducharme**: Now we're waiting on Eli at this point for a few things, but he's given me enough guidance to, to pass down, to try to get just.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, as, as we grow and as you get people, you know, that are going to start working for you, you know, apm, things like that, you're going to have these same expectations and make sure that they deliver upon it as well.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And if you're wanting someone else to do something, you got to be able to prove that you could, you're able to do it.
**Bclymer**: Or else how do you judge what they're doing?
**Bclymer**: I know it's possible because I've done it multiple times.
**Bclymer**: So it's just something you put yourself, your own little schedule of buyout and you knock it out.
**Bclymer**: At least, you know, one good thing is you can write all your scopes.
**Bclymer**: You don't have to wait.
**Bclymer**: Like if there is some things missing in the design, you know, 90% of what's in there or not so that whenever you get that final bit of information you need now, it's not another week goes by, you know, before you issue that subcontract so well.
**Gducharme**: So part of it too is I have all of the money that I was able to add up from painting and the wood and the casework and finishes and add all that up, and then I have to start divvying out $800,000 in basically interior finishes.
**Gducharme**: And so I got to divvy that out and make sure that I can get all of that done within that money.
**Gducharme**: Because if I take any of these estimates, they're all more than that individually or right up or right up against it.
**Gducharme**: And they're not accounting for everything.
**Bclymer**: But does it mean we're not doing the job if there's not?
**Gducharme**: No, it means that I, I'm not.
**Gducharme**: I would, I didn't want to buy anything out that I was still waiting on numbers on, especially for something like J and L when they did framing and did everything.
**Gducharme**: I could have bought that out two months ago, but it would have cost us, you know, maybe 100 plus thousand dollars based on where the numbers are coming in.
**Gducharme**: Yet now by not shopping it and making sure I got other numbers.
**Gducharme**: So, yeah, typically, like, I, I, I don't really like bulking things up like that in one contract for a couple of reasons.
**Gducharme**: One, you know, like J, now they probably don't so perform all that.
**Gducharme**: They're subbing some of it out, so now we're just paying markup on whatever it is that they're marking up.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Gducharme**: And then two, if you have a bunch of stuff in one person's contract like that, then if they falter, you're really screwed because it takes so much of it.
**Gducharme**: So, you know, it can be easier and it's great because it's just one phone call and blah, blah, blah.
**Gducharme**: But you also have to look at the risk side of things.
**Gducharme**: Right?
**Gducharme**: Yeah, you said that earlier.
**Gducharme**: So I, I stopped even entertaining that and started splitting it.
**Gducharme**: I started asking for different subs to come in.
**Gducharme**: I got some other subs to come in and bid on everything.
**Gducharme**: And it's, and it's great for creating those relationships with other people.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Gducharme**: Estimating is probably something I never really have had to do.
**Gducharme**: Estimating and just even doing these change orders, getting pricing together for the bathroom, going through three or four iterations of that, and just, that's just not something I'm used to having to go back and consider.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, seems easy.
**Gducharme**: But the, the biggest thing I would Say with, at least for me, with estimating and most good estimators, I think, and Jesse can, you know, comment on this as well, is you're essentially building a project in your brain.
**Gducharme**: Right.
**Gducharme**: You know, you're going through and building it in your mind and going through with all your scopes.
**Gducharme**: Like, for me, like.
**Gducharme**: Like when I do something, I'll be like, all right, I need this.
**Gducharme**: And I'll just, literally just write jot down, like, what all my scopes would be and so that I can cross reference and check it.
**Gducharme**: Right.
**Gducharme**: And so that's.
**Gducharme**: That's usually what makes a good estimators.
**Gducharme**: They're able to build it in their mind.
**Bclymer**: And we have tools to help you with that.
**Bclymer**: There's the, you know, we have the scope sheets that you build along with your estimate, and you just type in there all the things you want them to do.
**Bclymer**: And then a lot of times, like, if you just send plans to a sub and not have a scope sheet attached to it, then they waste half their time trying to figure out what it is they want.
**Bclymer**: You want them to bid.
**Bclymer**: But if you have that clearly defined form, it's easy because then they go in and that's the only thing they're looking for.
**Gducharme**: Yep.
**Gducharme**: Remember, ambiguity is the enemy of construction.
**Gducharme**: You know what that means?
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Gducharme**: Too much information.
**Gducharme**: No, no.
**Gducharme**: Ambiguity is lack of information.
**Gducharme**: So whenever, like, you just send them a drawing and say, give me a number.
**Gducharme**: That's very ambiguous.
**Gducharme**: Right.
**Gducharme**: A number for what?
**Gducharme**: Right.
**Gducharme**: But if you say, here, I need you to give me a number to paint these four walls, you know, this is going to be a hard ceiling.
**Gducharme**: Do it.
**Gducharme**: Blah, blah, blah, whatever.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, I've been doing that as scope reviews with everybody.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, but what is on the front end?
**Gducharme**: On the front end.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Gducharme**: When you, when you.
**Gducharme**: Because again, like, these guys.
**Gducharme**: Think about it.
**Gducharme**: When you're a subcontractor, like, you might get 10 bid invites and win one.
**Gducharme**: Right.
**Gducharme**: And so they're.
**Gducharme**: They're constantly scrambling.
**Gducharme**: So the easier we can make it for them to look at something, the more advantageous they're going to be to give us a number and a good number at that.
**Gducharme**: Because instead of them, you know, rifling through it and like, whatever, and just throwing a number at it, if it's.
**Gducharme**: If it's more detailed and easier for them, then they can get a little bit more aggressive.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And as we, you know, then you've also, you've basically written your scope of work and it's done for you.
**Bclymer**: So then when you, you Just open up that sheet and you write your scope work to the sub, add in whatever additional things you want to add in there.
**Bclymer**: But it's, that's the whole thought process is.
**Bclymer**: It's such a process of having to go from an estimate to a job to a subcontracts with the minimal amount of rework and rethinking and all of that because you, you got to do it in the front end anyways to do your estimate.
**Gducharme**: Right.
**Bclymer**: And get.
**Bclymer**: Just like you said, If I got 10s, you know, jobs thrown at me, I would.
**Bclymer**: Human nature, you want to just knock out the easiest one, the quickest one first.
**Bclymer**: And, and that's what, you know, you'll get better, better reaction times from the subs.
**Bclymer**: But, you know, then your job, the next job, the pm, if it's not the estimator, he already has the scopes, you know, written for him as well.
**Bclymer**: So anyways.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, so I think again, you know, what you wrote here, adopting the design, you know, build mentality to change direction, design team.
**Gducharme**: You know, I got my note on here was I agree with everything you put on here.
**Gducharme**: You know, applying the 1, 31 rule, you know, is critical, especially, you know, not only for us, but again, you're going to want that same thing apply according to you.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, right.
**Gducharme**: That's important because it's like our most valuable thing that we have is our ability to problem solve and think critically.
**Gducharme**: Right.
**Gducharme**: And so if you constantly hit the easy button, you know, me or Jesse, you're never going to grow.
**Gducharme**: Right.
**Gducharme**: And so you want to make sure, like, how can I grow?
**Gducharme**: How can I be the best version?
**Gducharme**: How can I be excellent at my craft?
**Gducharme**: Anything, Jesse?
**Bclymer**: No, that.
**Bclymer**: Agreed.
**Bclymer**: I mean, and just you know, one thing, like I would work on simplifying, you know, when you're asking a question or you're answering a question, like.
**Gducharme**: It'S.
**Bclymer**: Almost less is more.
**Bclymer**: It's like just if you, you just have a quick, to the point, you know, I don't have a lot of time.
**Bclymer**: So having a big explanation why this is this or that, it's more important you just come to us, say, here's the problem, this didn't work.
**Bclymer**: This is what I want to do.
**Bclymer**: Like, honestly, like listening to reasons why this didn't work or that didn't work or I'm not done or whatever.
**Bclymer**: Like, you know, that's, that's, to me, it's wasting time.
**Bclymer**: It's like, what is the problem?
**Bclymer**: What is the solution?
**Bclymer**: And you know, you'll, you'll save Yourself a lot of time.
**Bclymer**: You'll save us time because, you know, a lot of that background stuff doesn't really matter because it's, you know, that's just how life is.
**Bclymer**: There's all kinds of stumbling blocks along the way.
**Bclymer**: So just when you come to us with a problem or a solution, just simplify it, you know, break it down into here's the problem, here's what we can do to fix it, and then just forget about leaving all the explanations in there because, you know, it doesn't, doesn't really matter to me because I know happens just the quickest way we can get it resolved.
**Gducharme**: You ever heard the acronym kiss?
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: All right, so next was what do you, like your manager does?
**Bclymer**: She said you said, gives direction, leads me to complete it.
**Bclymer**: Always answers the why when I have questions.
**Bclymer**: Remains calm when helping to solve issues or when teaching.
**Bclymer**: So you must be talking about Brandon.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, yeah.
**Gducharme**: No, I, I, I question a lot.
**Gducharme**: Like, I question you a lot.
**Gducharme**: Not questioning you, but questioning why so that I understand.
**Gducharme**: I know, I know that you're usually, you know, knowledgeable and everything that I've come to you and asked so far.
**Gducharme**: So I'm not, I don't ever try to not make it come across like I'm questioning, questioning why we're doing it, but why we're doing it so that I know for, for future or I mean, just something that just can't wrap my head around seeing it that I haven't seen in person or on the ground.
**Gducharme**: So.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, but yeah, you, you were, you're typically pretty good about letting me ask my, letting me ask my question and figure out what's confusing me and then explaining, explaining it.
**Gducharme**: Even though you might have already given me my answer by then, sometimes the answer is still, like, I can relate.
**Gducharme**: Relay that answer, but I still don't understand that doesn't do me any good.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, well, I'll try to be better.
**Bclymer**: I'm usually if I've had a couple beers, then I'll.
**Bclymer**: I'm more open to talking, so.
**Gducharme**: So usually by 8am he's solid.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: The 131 rule.
**Bclymer**: One beer every three minutes for one hour.
**Bclymer**: Good to go.
**Gducharme**: That's funny.
**Bclymer**: Well, there's anything else we can help you with, definitely.
**Bclymer**: We just want you to keep growing.
**Bclymer**: Next seven.
**Bclymer**: Working your manager improve.
**Bclymer**: I don't have any input on this.
**Bclymer**: Why is that?
**Bclymer**: I mean, it's not like you're telling us how to be better.
**Bclymer**: It's just how do we be better at helping you or managing what you're doing like that was.
**Bclymer**: That's what this means.
**Gducharme**: No, I know I don't.
**Gducharme**: You guys have both been able, been available and answered questions that I've had and I don't have anything to input on to input on that.
**Gducharme**: I don't think you guys have been failing me in any path or.
**Bclymer**: Where do you want to be in five years?
**Bclymer**: Ops manager, VP of operations, overseeing multiple project teams.
**Bclymer**: So this is what we tell everybody is like you'd be surprised how many.
**Gducharme**: People want to run operations here.
**Gducharme**: Everybody wants to be, you know, an Ops manager, VP or something in five years.
**Gducharme**: It's amazing.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, but really.
**Gducharme**: Well, it's not a place to go with it for an accompany the size.
**Gducharme**: You know, when you're a pm, senior pm, where else do you go?
**Gducharme**: Well, he'll explain it to you here in a minute.
**Bclymer**: Well, what I'm saying is like you know, we want to be the best at our craft.
**Bclymer**: Like it'd be, you know, if you're not a good pm, then why would you be a senior operations manager, senior VP?
**Bclymer**: Like if you don't know how to be do PMing, right.
**Bclymer**: Or the best at it.
**Bclymer**: So that's, you know, our mentality should be in five years I want to be the best PM and you know the industry and you know, no design build like the back of my hand and know how to manage all these different processes so that I'm able to be a good Ops manager or vp.
**Bclymer**: And that's like the mentality everyone should have, you know.
**Gducharme**: Go ahead Jesse.
**Bclymer**: When I started I said in 20 years I hope I can be a senior PM.
**Bclymer**: And I never got there until I.
**Bclymer**: It took me 25 years.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: But I became a good PM and a damn good superintendent.
**Gducharme**: So I mean, yeah, it's the same thing for me.
**Gducharme**: Like you know, when I was working for Jesse, like you know my goal was to be a PM and be a badass PM and run a hundred million dollar hospital tower, right.
**Gducharme**: Like I.
**Gducharme**: And then one day make VP eventually.
**Gducharme**: Right.
**Gducharme**: But like you know, I wanted to be the very best, like the, the most knowledgeable, like excellent so that I was the guy, the go to guy.
**Gducharme**: And that's how you know we would like you to strive for.
**Gducharme**: So like think about it like when you are great at estimating, great at project management, the value that brings.
**Gducharme**: Because then all of a sudden, right.
**Gducharme**: Like if I sell work or whatever, I can be okay.
**Gducharme**: You know, Glenn can run with it from here, right.
**Gducharme**: Like you can, you could take a, a collective, you know, A poor collective or something like that.
**Gducharme**: And, you know, you can run it from now where we just got released, and take us through design, budgeting, estimating, the entire, you know, gambit.
**Gducharme**: But what's, I mean, that's the.
**Gducharme**: That's where, you know, I think you need to have your mark.
**Gducharme**: You know, it's like, I gotta be like, where are my weaknesses?
**Gducharme**: And I've got to turn those into strengths.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, that makes sense.
**Bclymer**: Next question was, how can I help you get there?
**Bclymer**: By getting me on some other of the other projects we have going on as early as possible to continue to get experience in design, development, permitting, estimating and everything that goes into these projects before they're assigned to the project management team.
**Bclymer**: And so this is like a common thing, you know, a common response, I guess, for myself and Brandon.
**Bclymer**: And that is when people ask for more work to be given to them because they want to do more.
**Bclymer**: Like, we have to be confident.
**Bclymer**: Just like Westfield now, we're not done with contracts subcontracts, and you're not really sure when you're going to be 100% done.
**Bclymer**: So why would we give you more on your plate so that that job struggles more?
**Bclymer**: So, like, we ask everybody.
**Bclymer**: I.
**Bclymer**: I think it's great when people want to do more, but don't think, you know, we'll give you a ton more if you're like, I'm done with everything.
**Bclymer**: I need something to do that makes sense.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So by, you know, that's how you, you know, you get more thrown at you.
**Bclymer**: Like, we got plenty of new stuff coming up in this exact position that you're describing there.
**Bclymer**: They're in the early stages of development, but, like, you know, if you think of it from our side, okay, we got a promising new client.
**Bclymer**: We're going to give it to Glenn, but we know he's struggling to get the other job or two jobs he's working done.
**Bclymer**: So are we going to risk that or are we just going to go ahead and work ourselves to death to make sure that that job, you know, gets started off on the right foot?
**Bclymer**: So we for sure want ex.
**Bclymer**: Want more people in this company who, when they ask us or we have something come up, like, we're confident we're going to give you that and it's going to be just as successful and it's not going to, you know, cause any detriment to whatever you're working on currently.
**Gducharme**: It doesn't seem like Westfield's struggling.
**Gducharme**: Well, when you, when you don't have, like, for instance, like, When I asked, well, when are we gonna be done with buyout?
**Gducharme**: And you don't know?
**Gducharme**: Like, that's like, you should.
**Gducharme**: You should know, like, hey, yes, like, I'll have everything this week except for xyz, you know, and I should have those done by this time.
**Gducharme**: Like, that's what we're talking about, like, right now.
**Gducharme**: Like, I.
**Gducharme**: You can't tell me when it's going to be bought out for those last couple positive things.
**Gducharme**: Like, like the air curtains.
**Gducharme**: Maybe not the rest.
**Gducharme**: The rest of it this week, but.
**Gducharme**: But that's what we're talking about.
**Gducharme**: Like, like that.
**Gducharme**: Those last couple things that are getting like that.
**Gducharme**: Getting that stuff done and taken care of.
**Gducharme**: Like.
**Gducharme**: Like, I'm pretty sure, like, if I wouldn't, you know, I could.
**Gducharme**: If I dove into this, I would definitely have this air curtains and whatever bought out this week.
**Gducharme**: Like, you know, with that, with a reasonable amount of certainty, I could get it all bought out and ready to roll.
**Gducharme**: That's without me even looking at it.
**Gducharme**: And that's what, you know, you need to be able to do.
**Gducharme**: Like, even if you're waiting on whatever.
**Gducharme**: Like, all right, well, do we know what's coming in?
**Gducharme**: Design.
**Gducharme**: Right?
**Gducharme**: Can we go ahead and get this figured out?
**Gducharme**: Like, hey, we're probably going to do this here.
**Gducharme**: You know, take.
**Gducharme**: You know, take it off.
**Gducharme**: Like, whatever it is, like, should be able to get it done.
**Bclymer**: And Glenn, we're not harping on you.
**Bclymer**: We're just talking about our experience.
**Bclymer**: And, like, you know what you are capable of.
**Bclymer**: You can be capable of that.
**Bclymer**: But I would say the same thing.
**Bclymer**: Like, if, if, if.
**Bclymer**: How many subcontracts do you have left to Write for Westfield?
**Gducharme**: 5, 4 or 5.
**Bclymer**: So you don't know how many they're left to.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Gducharme**: I have to go count on my board countertops, painting the finishes and key off of the doors.
**Gducharme**: Then whatever we do with this curtain, whether I buy them or do another contract for them or whatever happens with that.
**Gducharme**: I think what he's alluding to is that with you having two jobs, like, you should know these at the back of your hand.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And just.
**Bclymer**: That's what I'm saying.
**Bclymer**: Like, Brandon and myself, we would have that done this week.
**Bclymer**: Like, no question.
**Bclymer**: No question.
**Bclymer**: You just.
**Bclymer**: You push through and you can get it done.
**Bclymer**: And that's just experience and having to pause or.
**Gducharme**: Huh.
**Gducharme**: You're, you're, you're.
**Gducharme**: There it is now you're back.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And it's just.
**Bclymer**: That's just what.
**Bclymer**: When you get experience and you, you Get a system down of how to make that happen and get it done.
**Bclymer**: You get it done.
**Bclymer**: It's just, you get to that point, you know, you have this job all bought out, then.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, we got other stuff right now you could get involved in, which is tell us, hey, I'm done, I'm ready.
**Bclymer**: This job's on cruise control.
**Bclymer**: Everything's bought out.
**Bclymer**: Here's my procurement list.
**Bclymer**: I know when everything's going to get there.
**Bclymer**: It lines up with the schedule.
**Bclymer**: All I got to do is look at sub billings and send an owner billing out each month.
**Bclymer**: Give me something else to do.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, and we want, trust me, like, like literally talking to Jesse, like we have to talk later today.
**Gducharme**: Like now we've got more jobs hitting, like who's gonna run some of this stuff?
**Gducharme**: You know, like we're, you know, hiring another guy like down there in St.
**Gducharme**: Pete.
**Gducharme**: You know, it's like, yeah, I mean we, trust me, we want you to get this done so we can give you other project.
**Bclymer**: Good.
**Bclymer**: The question number 10.
**Gducharme**: So you know, I one of the notes on here about like, you know, be diligent and urgent on getting things done.
**Gducharme**: I think it's primary.
**Gducharme**: You know, always ask yourself, like, what am I missing?
**Gducharme**: You know, what, you know, what more can I do?
**Gducharme**: How can I improve, right?
**Gducharme**: Like, you know, hear the acronym.
**Gducharme**: Can I C A N I constant and never ending improvement.
**Gducharme**: Right?
**Gducharme**: You know, that's like everybody knows I'm a, you know, big personal development guy and everything.
**Gducharme**: But like, if you think about, like if I can just get 1% better every day, you know, how that's going to compound over the course of the year and 5 years and 10 years and how much better you're going to be at your craft as a person.
**Gducharme**: All these things.
**Gducharme**: So if you kind of say like, okay, you know, how can I get a little bit better and use your resources, right?
**Gducharme**: Like, you know, you talk about like you don't have experience or you know, you haven't done certain things well, you know, you can use, you know, you have so many tools.
**Gducharme**: Like you can use Jet GPT or you can, you know, just Google YouTube.
**Gducharme**: Like there's so many things.
**Gducharme**: Like the good thing about construction is it's the oldest industry there is, right?
**Gducharme**: Like people first thing they did was get build something, right?
**Gducharme**: And so there's tons of free knowledge that you can have out there to learn things that you don't know.
**Gducharme**: Like start to start to use that stuff.
**Gducharme**: Like whether it's just, you know, like driving to work, right.
**Gducharme**: Or Wherever.
**Gducharme**: Like, well, instead of listening to music, you know, listen to an audiobook or, you know, something that is teaching you about your craft.
**Gducharme**: Right.
**Gducharme**: Same thing.
**Gducharme**: You know, if you're, if you're just working, right, like, and you, you want some noise, like, try to use that time to feed your mind with things that are going to help you grow.
**Gducharme**: It's called no extra net time.
**Gducharme**: No extra time.
**Gducharme**: So doing things that are not going to cost you.
**Gducharme**: That's why I love audiobooks, you know, I listen to them all the time because I can be driving, traveling, whatever, and consume knowledge and not have to separate and like, you know, sit down and read a book, you know, and actually only do one thing.
**Gducharme**: I can do multiple things at once.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, I just, I just finished this one book.
**Gducharme**: It's called it's your ship.
**Gducharme**: It's a leadership book, you know, for business owners.
**Gducharme**: I loved it.
**Gducharme**: You know, I listened to it several times.
**Bclymer**: Personally, I try to learn.
**Bclymer**: I cut back to 0.0005% new things a day because I don't want to run out of new stuff to learn.
**Bclymer**: So I'm almost there.
**Gducharme**: Jesse's forgotten more than I'll ever know.
**Gducharme**: So.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so that's all good.
**Bclymer**: Definitely.
**Bclymer**: Like he said, there's talking to some of the other guys.
**Bclymer**: I mean, took me 25 years to do a post tension structure of the construction.
**Bclymer**: So like, and I, and it's cool, but like, you don't have to wait until we do a job to learn that now.
**Bclymer**: Like what he's saying with the YouTube videos and everything else out there, you can learn about other types of construction.
**Bclymer**: And you know, when we get into these, you know, hotels and sports parks and like all these other things, like you can help yourself out, you know, just learning new, different types of construction so that you're more helpful.
**Bclymer**: Like when you get involved in them on the front end too.
**Bclymer**: And the design team, you know, what they're, you know what their concept is and what they're going after.
**Bclymer**: So it's all good stuff.
**Bclymer**: Number 10, what do you want to ask me that you haven't yet?
**Bclymer**: You said, where can I improve?
**Bclymer**: Aside from what's listed above, I think we talk through most of those things.
**Bclymer**: What can I do to get involved in other projects?
**Bclymer**: We discussed that.
**Bclymer**: Just handle your job and you're done with it.
**Bclymer**: It's on cruise control.
**Bclymer**: We'll definitely be handing you more work.
**Bclymer**: What is the intent for me over the next year?
**Bclymer**: What am I being lined up for?
**Bclymer**: So, you know, the Westfield Collective goes until It'll be January, February of next year when you close that job out.
**Bclymer**: Like I said, we got.
**Bclymer**: I mean, are you looking to stay in Indianapolis or would you move to a job site elsewhere?
**Gducharme**: I mean, it depends on if it's big and it's long enough to make sense.
**Gducharme**: I do rent here, so I could eat more easily get up and go than I could in the past with owning a house, but I didn't really have any thought on that either way.
**Gducharme**: I figured it might be a possibility with us being out of the, you know, doing projects out of state and stuff.
**Gducharme**: But then again, the PM just don't.
**Gducharme**: Aren't on site for any of our projects now.
**Gducharme**: So a lot of them gets big enough, it'll be, It'll be necessary.
**Gducharme**: But yeah, I mean, you got to think like, there's no need to have a pm, obviously for Westfield.
**Gducharme**: It's not that.
**Gducharme**: It's not that big, John B.
**Gducharme**: It's in our backyard.
**Gducharme**: Right?
**Gducharme**: Yeah, but like Port collective, that's a $40 million job that'll have an on site PM.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Gducharme**: You know, obviously the Paradise Isles will have, you know, multiple people, you know, so there's probably.
**Bclymer**: Will do what that Kentucky project that would be a on site person.
**Gducharme**: So what he's asking is like, are you open to travel or are you simply.
**Gducharme**: Or you just want to work on stuff that's local here?
**Gducharme**: No, I, I'm definitely open to travel.
**Gducharme**: Living full time would be.
**Gducharme**: We would have to discuss that obviously.
**Gducharme**: But.
**Gducharme**: Well, when we talk about.
**Gducharme**: I'm not talking about you fly out for a week, but when we say travel, it's like, like for instance, like port collective is 18 months.
**Gducharme**: Like if we said, hey, you know, go run that job.
**Gducharme**: Oh, just travel.
**Gducharme**: Just be down there for the whole duration.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Gducharme**: Yes.
**Gducharme**: You're open to that or I would be open to having a conversation.
**Gducharme**: Okay, well, again, there's no wrong answer, but that tells us like, okay, like there's options outside of here.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Gducharme**: You know, you know, we can't guarantee like so like here locally.
**Gducharme**: Right.
**Gducharme**: Like we've got, you know, the Noblesville Cell center, which we're.
**Gducharme**: We're going to toss that Nick's way since he's already done them.
**Gducharme**: You know, we've got another ground up hopefully we should get from Goodwill here and I think it's on the east side, southeast side, Brooksville Road area.
**Gducharme**: Hopefully we get that one.
**Gducharme**: You know, that's a possibility.
**Gducharme**: I just not sure on timeline on that one.
**Gducharme**: And then the Union, Kentucky job, you know, depending on you know what that end ups going.
**Gducharme**: I mean, that's another possibility that should.
**Bclymer**: Well, if Memphis goes to.
**Bclymer**: That wouldn't be a on site PM, but that would.
**Bclymer**: We're gonna need a PM for that.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, or something.
**Bclymer**: Memphis Phase 2.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, I don't know what we're gonna do with that one.
**Gducharme**: And then again we're, you know, always getting other stuff.
**Gducharme**: I mean, keep in mind, I don't even, I don't really even do business development.
**Gducharme**: Like we can't afford, you know, half the time we can't get the stuff covered now.
**Gducharme**: So.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, there's definitely stuff.
**Gducharme**: I mean, you know, like, you know, where can you improve?
**Gducharme**: Like, I'd say one thing.
**Gducharme**: It seems like you lack confidence, you know, and a lot of times when I talk to you, it's almost like you're it.
**Gducharme**: It comes off like you're scared to mess up and worried that like we're gonna fire, you know, 100.
**Gducharme**: Okay, well, I've been laid off or let go three times and since I moved here in less than five years, four.
**Gducharme**: I mean, nothing that I did.
**Gducharme**: But I mean, I could, I mean, you know, it could happen that way.
**Gducharme**: It could have been no, no work, or I was the easiest one to let go or the newest person.
**Gducharme**: Like, I don't.
**Gducharme**: Well, I can tell you, like Jesse and I have not had a conversation about letting you go or anything of as such.
**Gducharme**: So if you can let that go, because I think that's a big part of what's holding you back is because like that lack of confidence in your abilities is hindering you from improving because instead of, you know, just making decisions, going with it and moving with a sense of urgency, you're too scared to make a mistake.
**Gducharme**: And then therefore you're not doing anything, which in turn is a mistake.
**Gducharme**: It's a negative feedback loop.
**Gducharme**: Right.
**Gducharme**: So you just have to, you know, change that and say, hey, like I, I'm going to get this done and move forward, like, lead from the front.
**Gducharme**: Like, know that, you know, we're here.
**Gducharme**: Like we're not, you know, sitting here.
**Gducharme**: Oh my gosh, his next mistake, he's gone.
**Gducharme**: Right?
**Gducharme**: Like, nothing like that.
**Gducharme**: Like, you know, we, we believe in you, we think that you can learn and grow.
**Gducharme**: But yeah, we're not sitting here, you know, wait for you to mess up so we can get rid of it.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, I definitely do have pause when it comes to if there's something I make a mistake.
**Gducharme**: That's why I come and ask you about stuff.
**Gducharme**: Anything financial, some things I don't mind just making the call and going for it.
**Gducharme**: But you know, I did do that once with the drain line and that was something that we, that I shouldn't have done.
**Gducharme**: Even though I had the county telling me this is what we had to do, which wasn't even right.
**Gducharme**: So I was like triple checking at this point.
**Gducharme**: It's better off.
**Gducharme**: But even that, that drain, the drain line thing, right, like that wasn't the end of the world, right?
**Gducharme**: Well, no, but it could have been 15, 20 grand that we paid for that.
**Gducharme**: That could have been one of the expensive mistakes that I made.
**Gducharme**: But I mean even then, like I said, the county was tied.
**Gducharme**: Just.
**Gducharme**: I think you were out in Africa at that time.
**Gducharme**: I was just like, I just need to make this decision.
**Gducharme**: And yeah, like I don't want to make decisions on, on behalf of you, either of you especially.
**Bclymer**: But it's pretty like yours clients rather, it's really defined for you.
**Bclymer**: Like when you come to make decisions like if we have a job, is it on the drawings?
**Bclymer**: It's on the drawings and we have a contract to do the work.
**Bclymer**: We own it if it's not on the drawings and it's something either the owner or the county or the city, once done, then it's like easy, like, okay, it's cost this much and then it's a simple.
**Bclymer**: I don't know if that's a 131 rule, but you just send it to me or Brandon because then it's a simple question to answer and then we can give you direction and then you go that way.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, but I mean it's pretty.
**Bclymer**: Other than some of the design build that we do that we don't get our design quite as fine tuned as it should be.
**Bclymer**: Like a thing like it either belongs to us or it doesn't.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, that's the other thing with violence too is we're, we, we want the projection.
**Gducharme**: But if it's, if it's so wrong because we have more stuff coming out that's going to change everything I buy out anyways then.
**Gducharme**: Well, but, but what Projection.
**Gducharme**: But some of that stuff that you're talking about with all these changes with the finishes and whatnot.
**Gducharme**: Like those are changes, right?
**Gducharme**: Let's get those now.
**Gducharme**: Yes, now those.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, let's, let's, you know, we get the base contract written and executed and you know, changes come, we write a change, but you don't want to delay because of something that might change.
**Gducharme**: Right.
**Gducharme**: And I'm not.
**Gducharme**: We waited until the final IFC drawings were out because that was.
**Gducharme**: Was going to move all the walls and tell us what was where.
**Gducharme**: Because, I mean, the page of the drawings weren't finished, but now that they are, then I gave it out to everybody on a Tuesday.
**Gducharme**: I said, hey, by next Friday.
**Gducharme**: So you have 10 days.
**Gducharme**: Give me your updated pricing.
**Gducharme**: Some people did, some people didn't.
**Gducharme**: I followed up with them.
**Gducharme**: I did get them.
**Gducharme**: I reviewed them.
**Gducharme**: Hey, here's your markup.
**Gducharme**: I'm not asking you to.
**Gducharme**: That's where we're at.
**Gducharme**: I'm not asking you to run me through everything that you did.
**Gducharme**: This is one of those examples of, like, what Jesse was talking about earlier with, we don't need to know every single step you took.
**Gducharme**: We just.
**Gducharme**: Here's the outcome that we're after now, again, this is what we're trying to do, is just coach you up a little bit on how you can get better.
**Gducharme**: And so again, you're sitting there trying to explain everything so that you're like, oh, I didn't mess up.
**Gducharme**: It's clear.
**Gducharme**: You're like, oh, trying to show that you're doing it.
**Gducharme**: We understand.
**Gducharme**: You don't have to, again, cover your bases and worry about us being mad at firing people.
**Gducharme**: You don't need to do that.
**Gducharme**: You're not going anywhere.
**Bclymer**: Like, we're.
**Gducharme**: We like you, like, most of the time.
**Gducharme**: So that's a joke.
**Gducharme**: Like, you know what I mean?
**Gducharme**: Like, we.
**Gducharme**: We think you have a good future.
**Bclymer**: But you think about, like, what you were just saying, Glenn.
**Bclymer**: You could have said, I got the ICF drawings a week ago.
**Bclymer**: I sent it out to the subs.
**Bclymer**: It gave them two weeks to price it up.
**Bclymer**: All that pricing is due this Friday.
**Bclymer**: I'll have all my subcontracts done by next Tuesday because it'll all be drafted, ready to shoot out the door as soon as I get their pricing back on Friday.
**Bclymer**: And that's it.
**Bclymer**: And then we're like.
**Bclymer**: We're like, well, shit, he's got that handled.
**Bclymer**: I wouldn't even ask another question.
**Bclymer**: Does that make sense?
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Gducharme**: Like I said, I think that, you know, again, you just shift that confidence a little bit.
**Gducharme**: Like, you know, start to.
**Gducharme**: And again, part of that comes with knowledge, right?
**Gducharme**: But take it upon yourself to increase your knowledge base and learn.
**Gducharme**: Like, seek out knowledge, and you're going to get better.
**Gducharme**: And as you get better, you're going to build more and more confidence.
**Gducharme**: You're going to be able to walk into a room and say, nope, here's what we're doing.
**Gducharme**: And, like, take that.
**Gducharme**: That Leadership role.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Sir.
**Bclymer**: Yes, sir.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Gducharme**: I don't have any problem being confident on stuff that I know that I'm.
**Gducharme**: That I know about.
**Gducharme**: But I thought that I was right many times and have not been right in this since.
**Gducharme**: Since being here.
**Gducharme**: Just on.
**Gducharme**: Just on general stuff or stuff that I thought was going on that it wasn't.
**Gducharme**: So when.
**Gducharme**: I don't want to be cocky if you're wrong, but if I know what it is, I'll deal with it, but with that, too.
**Gducharme**: Right?
**Gducharme**: Like, I.
**Gducharme**: I understand what you're saying.
**Gducharme**: You don't want to be copy and wrong.
**Gducharme**: That's good.
**Gducharme**: So, like, when you don't know something, right?
**Gducharme**: Like, again, that's where, like, you go, one, three, one.
**Gducharme**: Right?
**Gducharme**: Here's what I think we should do.
**Gducharme**: You know, here's problem three options.
**Gducharme**: Here's one thing we should do.
**Gducharme**: And also go do the research.
**Gducharme**: Like, if you don't know something, go figure it out.
**Gducharme**: Like, that's that critical thinking, problem solving that you have to know.
**Gducharme**: Like, you know, I'm going through this stuff with Paradise Isles, with clients.
**Gducharme**: I've never fucking done the shit, you know, that we have to do.
**Gducharme**: Like, but I have to just sit there and figure it out.
**Gducharme**: Right?
**Gducharme**: That's the value part of it.
**Gducharme**: And that's, again, if there's something you don't know, use the tools that you have at your disposal to learn it.
**Gducharme**: Right?
**Gducharme**: And if you're like, oh, I'm not sure on this, like, go find the backup.
**Gducharme**: You know, do the homework so that you have some actual data behind your decision.
**Gducharme**: You know?
**Gducharme**: Because if you make a decision, let's say it's the wrong decision, but you're like, look, I went here, here, and here, you know, per.
**Gducharme**: This, this, this, and you've got backup.
**Gducharme**: Then it's like, okay, yeah, like, I can see why you would make that decision based off of this homework and stuff you did.
**Gducharme**: Or you do the homework, you realize, okay, that's not the right decision because of this.
**Gducharme**: And then now you know.
**Gducharme**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: I learned a ton from subcontractors, too.
**Bclymer**: If I don't know something, I just call up several trades or several folks I know and just ask them what they think about certain things.
**Bclymer**: You can get a lot of information that way if it's something you're not sure about.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I mean, everyone loves to tell other people what they know, so you might.
**Bclymer**: They're going to enjoy it.
**Gducharme**: Jer doesn't.
**Gducharme**: Got any other questions for us?
**Gducharme**: No, not regarding this.
**Gducharme**: Just wanted to run this time before I finalized them?
**Gducharme**: Yes.
**Gducharme**: Anything else?
**Bclymer**: Nope, that's it.
**Gducharme**: All right, Glenn, thanks.
**Bclymer**: Talk to you next year.
**Bclymer**: Mark it on the calendar one year from today.
**Gducharme**: I can't believe you're wearing a freaking coat in Florida at this time.
**Bclymer**: No, it's freezing in this office.
**Gducharme**: I have a AC in my.
**Bclymer**: I was walking to the restrooms, and there was two of our larger female tenants in this building.
**Bclymer**: I walked by with my coat on.
**Bclymer**: They're like, well, somebody's air conditioning is working.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Gducharme**: All right.
**Gducharme**: You want to.
**Gducharme**: You can go through those with Jesse if you want.
**Gducharme**: I need to compass client back.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: What do you got?
**Gducharme**: I just have these two.
**Gducharme**: Well, I printed them out, but maybe you want to go look at them real quick on our change requests.
**Gducharme**: You want me just to get on the computer and teams use.
**Gducharme**: I can.
**Gducharme**: So we can look at it?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, sure.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Just call me.
**Bclymer**: I'm gonna get to your desk.
**Gducharme**: No, that's in that alternate down below.
**Gducharme**: We just did a square foot number.
