**Njepson**: They just confirmed that they had everything they needed to continue to move forward.
**Njepson**: Daniel is sending them, you know, the kitchens as they get ready.
**Njepson**: The commissary just came out to them late Friday as it's moving through.
**Njepson**: We just, you know, just gave them confirmation on late Friday about shifting the walls forward to give them that 3, 6 of space and give them enough clearance in the back wall or the back corridor.
**Njepson**: So they're just there continuing to.
**Njepson**: To design and fit everything as they're getting these files from.
**Njepson**: From Daniel over at the kitchen company.
**Njepson**: But our.
**Ataylor**: So our MEP designers can't.
**Ataylor**: Can't really get started on anything to finish their drawings.
**Njepson**: I mean, they told us in their.
**Njepson**: In the meeting on Thursday that, yeah, they got.
**Njepson**: They can.
**Njepson**: They can start on, you know, just running kind of running loads and running like the main lines and stuff.
**Njepson**: But until.
**Njepson**: Till they get final locations for all the kitchen equipment they can't get, they can't go that far.
**Njepson**: But yes, they're doing, they're doing what they can.
**Njepson**: But we're not going to have, I mean we're not going to have anything from them till maybe later this week for an updated set.
**Njepson**: As far as just a progress set kind of.
**Njepson**: But that's, that's the progress will be the kitchens.
**Njepson**: Not really much of any of the other architecturals.
**Ataylor**: And this TCP design meeting that's tonight, is it acp?
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: What's tcp?
**Njepson**: TCP is traffic control plan.
**Njepson**: That's to submit the T, that's to submit the traffic control plan.
**Njepson**: You do that.
**Njepson**: There's like a right, a right away permit that we do.
**Njepson**: I think I have, I have, I have it noted in there.
**Njepson**: We don't do it until after we get into the ILP process.
**Ataylor**: So when is that ACP meeting?
**Njepson**: Tonight at 7.
**Ataylor**: You know, and do.
**Ataylor**: Was one of us supposed to be on it?
**Njepson**: I'll be on it.
**Njepson**: Chad will be on it as well.
**Njepson**: Anybody's welcome to be on it.
**Njepson**: It's just, it's an open, open meeting.
**Njepson**: But they, the city recommends somebody be on it just in case they have any questions about our project.
**Njepson**: But they are still reviewing our, our permit drawings.
**Njepson**: So the APC is one step.
**Njepson**: But we, we, we don't necessarily have our permit approved because we got.
**Njepson**: After the APC meeting.
**Njepson**: We'll get that when, when the city finishes their, their review hopefully here in the next few days and then they'll get us our pre con and then we can start moving, moving forward.
**Ataylor**: The utility load letter for the electrical note that they got all the kitchen equipment info.
**Ataylor**: Are they finishing that?
**Njepson**: It's part, it's part of what they're working on.
**Njepson**: We asked them for yes, and then they have a meeting with Duke here on site.
**Njepson**: I think they said this week for the permanent transformer that they're putting in.
**Njepson**: So they've got, they've got that process started and they're tracking getting the utility load, the electric loads, the gas loads, all, all of that.
**Ataylor**: Everything good with the groundbreaking?
**Njepson**: Got your sign ordered, Groundbreaking is moving forward.
**Njepson**: So we'll have a OAC meeting tomorrow and discuss some, some things about that.
**Njepson**: But I'm getting.
**Njepson**: Maria and myself had a meeting with the Chamber of Commerce lady Courtney last week on Friday and she, she had a lot of good advice and just some good, you know, they do these all the time.
**Njepson**: So they're planning on bringing around 20 to 25 people.
**Njepson**: They said between the mayor's office people and some of the other businesses and the chamber of commerce attendees, like, for something like this, they expect about that much turnout, of course.
**Njepson**: Plus the owners in us as an Alito team.
**Njepson**: So we need to get a tent and chairs and tables and stuff.
**Njepson**: We're gonna look at doing the catering, food and drinks and getting.
**Njepson**: That's pretty.
**Njepson**: I mean, that's pretty much it.
**Njepson**: The rest of the stuff is internal stuff we need to provide.
**Njepson**: We got to get our shovels.
**Njepson**: It's Brandon on this meeting.
**Njepson**: Brandon, I went to the.
**Njepson**: We went.
**Njepson**: Looked at the storage unit.
**Njepson**: There's no.
**Njepson**: There's no shovels in there.
**Njepson**: There's not gold shovels anyways, so.
**Njepson**: And that.
**Njepson**: There's some tents, but not.
**Njepson**: Not.
**Njepson**: Yeah, they're not gold.
**Njepson**: Where's all those shovels that they use for the crate room?
**Njepson**: There's.
**Njepson**: There should be shovels in the storage unit, right?
**Njepson**: They're shovels, but they're not gold shovels or like ceremony, you know, groundbreaking shovels.
**Njepson**: I thought.
**Njepson**: That's what I thought.
**Njepson**: You guys had six of those.
**Ataylor**: He's got a.
**Ataylor**: Paint them gold.
**Ataylor**: Have Chad go out and get a can of spray paint and you paint them gold.
**Ataylor**: Like, not the handle, but just shovels.
**Njepson**: Would be hella expensive.
**Ataylor**: Just the.
**Njepson**: Like the end of the shovel.
**Njepson**: No.
**Njepson**: Yeah, I understand.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: Tried to pawn them and they wouldn't give them any money, too.
**Njepson**: That's scary.
**Njepson**: Busting your balls, Glenn.
**Bclymer**: Speaking of that, guys, we need to define.
**Bclymer**: Brandon, do you want to talk that day?
**Bclymer**: Because you're trying to have somebody from Alita talking about the project.
**Bclymer**: I was suggesting Glenn and Chad, or you want to talk?
**Njepson**: No.
**Njepson**: God, no.
**Bclymer**: I'll talk.
**Bclymer**: Okay, fine.
**Bclymer**: So Brandon, get ready with some speech about it and then question to you.
**Bclymer**: Are we going to do catering?
**Bclymer**: Like, they have this call company that do cook cookies and they have the logos on the cookies.
**Bclymer**: Do you want that or not?
**Njepson**: Well, I want to know what the price is for all that stuff.
**Bclymer**: So right now I'm gonna follow up with Kearney because she was supposed to introduce.
**Bclymer**: You know, give us an introductory email with Glenn, myself and the cater person.
**Bclymer**: So I'll just ask her for pricing.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: Glenn, you said you're working on the.
**Njepson**: The tent and chairs and stage, right?
**Njepson**: I'm working on the tent, chair, stage.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: I mean, Becky's bakery was on my list to call today.
**Njepson**: That's who it is, Maria.
**Njepson**: It's called Becky's bakery.
**Bclymer**: Thank you.
**Bclymer**: If you want to call Glenn or you want me to Call.
**Bclymer**: That's fine.
**Bclymer**: And then also I think, yeah, give.
**Njepson**: Her a call and see what she's got going on.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Like, I'll send an email so we.
**Njepson**: Can have all kinds of stuff.
**Njepson**: So to see if she has like a package deal that she normally runs or is it all a la carte or like, get some.
**Njepson**: Okay, maybe she has already something that she's used to.
**Njepson**: Like how many people?
**Njepson**: I have this for 50 people kind of thing.
**Bclymer**: I'll send the email.
**Bclymer**: And then also just to let you know, guys, the invitation was already sent to local news and magazines, so yeah, just expect people there.
**Bclymer**: Okay, I'll follow up with the.
**Bclymer**: I forgot her name again, but thank you.
**Bclymer**: I'll follow up with her.
**Njepson**: Glenn, do you.
**Njepson**: Is there.
**Njepson**: Do you know.
**Njepson**: I mean, are you getting RSVPs back on any of that, Maria?
**Bclymer**: Because no, I'm not.
**Njepson**: I'm planning for 50 people, but I don't.
**Njepson**: I don't assume a thousand are going to show up.
**Njepson**: But we're planning for 50, so.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, so currently say probably 50 people because that's what they do.
**Bclymer**: But I can ask her.
**Bclymer**: Courtney, how many are already rsvp because we can follow up with her.
**Bclymer**: I'll follow up.
**Bclymer**: I'll send an email to a bunch of people.
**Bclymer**: Okay, I will do that.
**Njepson**: Yeah, I emailed that to Courtney the other day.
**Njepson**: The map of the layout of the site.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: She didn't reply to you, right?
**Njepson**: No, she didn't know.
**Bclymer**: Okay, I will follow up on that one.
**Bclymer**: Thank you, Glenn.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: Where are you at, Jesse, on this line here.
**Njepson**: Here's in different order than mine.
**Ataylor**: Groundbreaking.
**Ataylor**: This is the sub bids.
**Ataylor**: I know you're working through those.
**Ataylor**: I got two of them today.
**Ataylor**: I'll review this evening.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Scopes.
**Njepson**: Yeah, just general scope review.
**Njepson**: As I was.
**Njepson**: That's just as kind of a note for me to.
**Njepson**: As I get.
**Njepson**: As I.
**Njepson**: As we go through buyout just to contact the subs and review their scopes and make sure they're apples to apples and everybody's kind of bidding on the same thing.
**Njepson**: So I can compare prices and prices within scopes.
**Ataylor**: So today weren't we supposed to get the lighting information to be able to give to the owner tomorrow?
**Njepson**: Y.
**Njepson**: I followed up with them this morning.
**Njepson**: They're.
**Njepson**: They're working on that.
**Njepson**: Said.
**Njepson**: Said she'd have it to me later this afternoon.
**Njepson**: And yeah, I'm just looking for an R O M on on that to provide the owners to see if that's an option they even want to go with at all.
**Ataylor**: A What rough order of attitude.
**Ataylor**: I thought we were just picking what kind of lights they wanted where.
**Njepson**: Well, no, it's the.
**Njepson**: These lighting is.
**Njepson**: Is the.
**Njepson**: The strip lighting that'll go.
**Njepson**: That can go, you know, at the bar, can go underneath the front of the bar, go in the back of the bar and go in the top bar.
**Njepson**: It could not go there at all.
**Njepson**: The LED LA that are kind of like more like spotlights that would go up in the rafters up in, you know, up in the volleyball room where they could change colors and have it shining down in one of the bays.
**Njepson**: Instead of doing a mural there, they could decorate it with lighting and change the lighting.
**Njepson**: So it's just trying to provide an option.
**Njepson**: Hey, do you guys want to do these murals?
**Njepson**: You want to do lighting?
**Njepson**: Do you want to.
**Njepson**: Do.
**Njepson**: You want this much lighting?
**Njepson**: You want no lighting?
**Ataylor**: All right, that was the last one.
**Ataylor**: Anything else need to be added to this?
**Njepson**: I mean, I'm work.
**Njepson**: I'm working through everything right now.
**Njepson**: I'm working on.
**Njepson**: Did you fencing.
**Njepson**: You got fencing up here, Brandon working on getting pricing for fencing right now.
**Njepson**: Obviously, we know our budget fencing was a bust, but just the fencing itself is nine grand.
**Njepson**: That's kind of all the numbers I got.
**Njepson**: I was able to get somebody down lower than United's number and then start.
**Njepson**: And they'll.
**Njepson**: They'll work with us on putting our logos and they'll take care of the screen.
**Njepson**: So they'll rent us this.
**Njepson**: The 500ft of screen, you know, that we.
**Njepson**: That we're not going to logo.
**Njepson**: And then we have to basically buy the 800ft that we are going to logo.
**Njepson**: And so he's working on pricing that up for me right now.
**Njepson**: What about the.
**Njepson**: Where are we at on buyout?
**Bclymer**: And.
**Njepson**: And, you know, so I know we've got obviously our steel.
**Njepson**: It sounds like we've got concrete.
**Njepson**: I'm around.
**Njepson**: And we're around $80,000 ahead right now without going into any interiors masonry.
**Njepson**: That's including.
**Njepson**: Yep, a big, big bump on masonry.
**Njepson**: We're ahead on overhead doors.
**Njepson**: Windows were ahead a little bit.
**Njepson**: We're ahead on concrete.
**Njepson**: I know, I know the 50,000 was contingency in there, but just going off of what we have in the budget numbers, we're ahead on surveying.
**Njepson**: We will have about 10,000 in testing.
**Njepson**: So we're only ahead about 10 grand on that.
**Njepson**: Not 20.
**Njepson**: We're 20 ahead on Lee Master.
**Njepson**: We're ahead on EFIs.
**Njepson**: We're a little bit or three.
**Njepson**: We're just a little bit ahead on ag peers, who do you have plugged.
**Bclymer**: For EFIs that you said we're ahead.
**Njepson**: On Duro or Euro?
**Njepson**: Euro, actually, the ETH has changed and they rebid it and came down lower.
**Njepson**: So asphalt.
**Njepson**: I'm gonna head on asphalt.
**Njepson**: So I was able to negotiate and get the thermal painting included in the price and still come in lower.
**Njepson**: Yeah, so that's.
**Njepson**: That's what I have on paper.
**Njepson**: I haven't put all that in the budget because it won't show up in the budget until you send a commitment out.
**Njepson**: But I think I'll have on the interior package with the painting and drywall and all that stuff.
**Njepson**: Since we're not going to have casework, it seems we're going to frame up those bars.
**Njepson**: I think I'm going to have anywhere from 60 to 100,000 left over between the interior, the Division 10 fire equipment stuff and the casework.
**Njepson**: Well, let's just look at it because, I mean, right now, obviously with it sounds like our plumbing is going to go up, our H Vac is going to go up.
**Njepson**: So.
**Njepson**: Yeah, based on.
**Njepson**: Based on what?
**Njepson**: The.
**Njepson**: From the.
**Njepson**: Adding the design fees after the budget or you're saying the kitchen.
**Njepson**: Based up the kitchen stuff.
**Njepson**: I didn't realize that was going to go go up.
**Njepson**: I'm using that part of their package to design or.
**Njepson**: No.
**Njepson**: You mean as far as for the subs for Dean?
**Njepson**: Yeah, for Dean and Spencer or dorsey or all three of the MEPs.
**Njepson**: Isn't that in Siemens?
**Njepson**: That's what that's in their package to design and provide that scope of work.
**Ataylor**: We got all the kitchen stuff coming in.
**Njepson**: Yeah, but you know, all the kitchen gas lines, the hoods, now we gotta.
**Bclymer**: Tie all that in that sanitary.
**Njepson**: So that was not part of it originally?
**Ataylor**: No.
**Njepson**: Is that a change order, the owner or.
**Njepson**: No.
**Ataylor**: Depends.
**Ataylor**: How much is it?
**Njepson**: Yeah, we'll have to look at it.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: I didn't realize the kitchens weren't part of this.
**Njepson**: I know the FF and E and stuff for them is, but is theirs.
**Njepson**: But I didn't realize.
**Ataylor**: You look at the original plans we did before we had any plans.
**Ataylor**: We wrote on their white box.
**Ataylor**: We're just going to stub in a gas pipe, an electric pipe and a drain.
**Ataylor**: That's it.
**Njepson**: Okay, but we have to.
**Njepson**: So the biggest thing that you guys don't see that Jesse and I see is we have to look at the relationship.
**Njepson**: Right.
**Bclymer**: So, you know, obviously with Westfield Collective, like, you know, if it's going to.
**Njepson**: Cost, you know, a hundred thousand dollars and you know we've got 100 to buy out.
**Njepson**: Then it's much easier to make that number smaller.
**Njepson**: We eat some of it.
**Bclymer**: You know, he gives a little.
**Njepson**: Some of it compared to just giving it to him because like they're handiness projects and some of these are very big projects.
**Njepson**: And so, you know, one of the.
**Bclymer**: Hand versus two in the bush.
**Njepson**: Right.
**Njepson**: So having those just giving to us is so powerful.
**Njepson**: Didn't have to go out try to get work and.
**Bclymer**: And all that.
**Njepson**: So it's part of that relationship thing.
**Njepson**: Well, just keep me in the loop if it has anything to do with money on a project for me.
**Njepson**: Yep.
**Ataylor**: All right, good.
**Ataylor**: Next.
**Ataylor**: Goodwill corporate office curb cut Nick as north side.
**Njepson**: They're going to work on getting some documents to the city of Indianapolis.
**Ataylor**: So you said additional permits.
**Ataylor**: They want us to pull what other permits now?
**Njepson**: The right of way permit and they also call one.
**Ataylor**: I noticed that same movement location.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Our side's working on that.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: Well, who's just gonna get back?
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: Story of our life.
**Ataylor**: Right.
**Ataylor**: Cedar Consulting building Burnville.
**Ataylor**: Wasn't Andrew up or Alex is up there now.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: So we've got an issue with the layout.
**Njepson**: But we should find out something on that tomorrow.
**Njepson**: Just gotta get fixed.
**Ataylor**: Keep moving.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Our problem.
**Ataylor**: We're fixing an owner's problem.
**Njepson**: That's what I'm trying to figure out.
**Njepson**: So I right now I don't like.
**Njepson**: Supposedly the racking does not match the drawing.
**Njepson**: Now my task for those guys to find out.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Njepson**: Exactly.
**Njepson**: We use the wrong drawing or is that they gave us the wrong drawing.
**Ataylor**: You know that Chris's guys used to design it.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: It'll never be the rat you guys fell make sure.
**Ataylor**: Does that mean refabricating all the pipe or just a lot more labor to put it in?
**Njepson**: I don't know the extent yet.
**Njepson**: We very well may have to refab some pipe.
**Bclymer**: It just depends.
**Njepson**: The branch line show up tomorrow.
**Njepson**: So we'll see if those it does line up.
**Bclymer**: Hopefully those line up and then it's.
**Njepson**: Just doing some field stuff.
**Njepson**: If not, then that's a big deal.
**Njepson**: All right.
**Njepson**: To include the well stuff in wood in Westfield Collective.
**Ataylor**: We just add a activity in there for it.
**Njepson**: I just did.
**Njepson**: But I didn't talk about it.
**Njepson**: I just got the pricing that you wanted.
**Njepson**: Brandon, how much is it?
**Njepson**: If we're to test and clean it to determine where it can go, if it can be reused would be a thousand bucks to to do that.
**Njepson**: If.
**Njepson**: If we do it and go towards the full project of 7 to 10k if they do want to keep the well, we can basically have to just install a manhole access cover in the parking lot.
**Njepson**: Not a structure, but a manhole access.
**Njepson**: And then we can route the electrical to the building, route the piping wherever they want so that they can hook it up to a sprinkler box or whatever they want to do to to use it for landscaping.
**Njepson**: It may have to get tested for landscape if they want to use it for landscaping.
**Njepson**: Or it's 1500 bucks just to cap and declare it abandoned.
**Njepson**: They'll fill it up and then do that right at the beginning of our project and then we can come in and do our cut and it's.
**Ataylor**: How much is it to just cap it?
**Njepson**: 1500 bucks.
**Ataylor**: So is how much water would they have to use for how many years?
**Ataylor**: For $6,500.
**Njepson**: Keep in mind that well that's all.
**Bclymer**: Going to be asphalt now, so that.
**Njepson**: Groundwater is not going to soak in.
**Bclymer**: And go to the well.
**Bclymer**: It's going to go offside.
**Bclymer**: That was be useless.
**Njepson**: We recommended that the well is going to be useless and their neighbor's well ran dry.
**Njepson**: But they looked it up that that neighbor's well is not a shallow well.
**Njepson**: I think it's 330ft deep.
**Njepson**: So there well is not even registered on the DNR.
**Ataylor**: But the fact that they are going to spend five to six thousand dollars, they would be able to water their grass for 20 years.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: Doesn't make any sense.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: But it's something that may not work.
**Ataylor**: So just make sure in the OAC they know that.
**Njepson**: Right.
**Ataylor**: Goodwill Bloomington.
**Njepson**: We're waiting on the utility department.
**Njepson**: They're supposed to have a response to us tomorrow.
**Ataylor**: And then we need what?
**Njepson**: Yeah, Wednesday, I guess we'll get a response and then we need to respond with their comments.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: And then we're going to plan is as soon as we get those comments Wednesday for sure we have to send all of everything we've walked since in the last walk with Andrew to the design team so they can start fixing all these comments.
**Ataylor**: And then we'll have a set to build off of because I happen to move in that canopy and those things have to get that price.
**Ataylor**: All right.
**Ataylor**: Aspire Newport Richey.
**Njepson**: That's going fine.
**Ataylor**: So you get the roof on and the photo report.
**Ataylor**: It's an awesome thing to have done.
**Ataylor**: Going to start raining here pretty soon.
**Ataylor**: Memphis Cold Storage.
**Njepson**: Just waiting on margin orders.
**Ataylor**: I'm going to mute my microphone for a second here.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: All right.
**Ataylor**: So but other than that, I think we're just waiting on.
**Njepson**: Apartment Memphis.
**Njepson**: We got boring happening at some point this week.
**Njepson**: They haven't given me a day yet, but other than that, we have nothing.
**Njepson**: Nothing going on there besides all the subs asking me if we're moving forward.
**Njepson**: Charlie's dead.
**Njepson**: They are done.
**Njepson**: What are you saying?
**Njepson**: I've sent everything to Steve.
**Ataylor**: A final price.
**Njepson**: We're waiting on Steve to say good.
**Njepson**: We're waiting on Steve to say go.
**Ataylor**: We have released.
**Ataylor**: Have we released Electric?
**Njepson**: Yeah, but he found the water clicker, and he's not, like, wanting to order anything until we give him.
**Ataylor**: Give him the contract.
**Njepson**: He wants to know he's gonna get paid for it, which.
**Njepson**: Which I don't blame him.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: All right.
**Ataylor**: Goodwill, Bart.
**Njepson**: Owner.
**Ataylor**: Sub changes, Nick says in progress.
**Ataylor**: I thought we were done.
**Njepson**: Landmark.
**Njepson**: They sent me a bunch of sign change orders this week.
**Njepson**: Who signed him?
**Ataylor**: Oh, Greg.
**Njepson**: He.
**Njepson**: He didn't sign them, so he.
**Njepson**: He signed him.
**Ataylor**: Nick wouldn't let him bill for him until he signed him.
**Njepson**: That's.
**Njepson**: That is good work, Nick.
**Njepson**: Other than that, I think Andrew with.
**Ataylor**: Goodwill signed the change orders.
**Njepson**: Wait, do they even look anymore at the joint orders?
**Ataylor**: Yeah, yeah, but we don't give them to them anymore, so Seniors May, so.
**Ataylor**: All right, so the schedule's been updated.
**Ataylor**: It's been sent out.
**Ataylor**: All the subs are on board with everything.
**Ataylor**: What was missing today that you were talking about?
**Njepson**: Fire extinguisher cabinets.
**Ataylor**: So there's.
**Ataylor**: We don't know if they put them in.
**Njepson**: Guess they're not there.
**Ataylor**: We got any photos of it?
**Ataylor**: I would have Alex go through, and he's supposed to make sure he was.
**Njepson**: Supposed to check them.
**Njepson**: Well, I said what you told him.
**Njepson**: He said he would.
**Njepson**: You didn't?
**Ataylor**: Well, no.
**Ataylor**: They hung all the drywall, but there's only three cut out.
**Ataylor**: And there's five fire extinguishers.
**Ataylor**: We just don't know where they are.
**Ataylor**: But Glenn, Mark.
**Ataylor**: I seen you going back and forth with Greg about it, so they should be able to find them.
**Ataylor**: They put them in Trade Escape.
**Ataylor**: When are you getting started again?
**Njepson**: Next week.
**Njepson**: I started ordering material.
**Njepson**: Day meeting with Yimmy on site to start ripping stuff down.
**Njepson**: Weston approved our drawings.
**Njepson**: You should have marked up Drone.
**Njepson**: I said.
**Njepson**: I actually, I just did copy and paste on a bunch of stuff and.
**Njepson**: Bumblebee beating.
**Njepson**: Cinematic.
**Njepson**: I think you're on the thread, but yeah, here's what I saw.
**Ataylor**: So they have the drawing.
**Ataylor**: They approved it.
**Njepson**: Everything's in writing.
**Ataylor**: Approved, perfect.
**Njepson**: So I'm ordering material.
**Njepson**: I got an updated quote from ABC because They picked their stone color, so I'll get that ordered.
**Njepson**: So you may see some, some charges here coming up for all that stuff.
**Njepson**: But next week we start.
**Njepson**: Wait, abc.
**Njepson**: We have an account that.
**Njepson**: Why would you put in a credit card?
**Njepson**: I'm not put.
**Njepson**: Well, if you see it like invoices.
**Njepson**: Oh, gotcha.
**Njepson**: Starts you start seeing stuff.
**Njepson**: That's all.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Njepson**: And then, you know, punch list on the fence next week.
**Njepson**: All this when I get back in town.
**Njepson**: So meeting with Yemi on site and then I make last week is kind of a show right now because Logan left.
**Njepson**: Logan actually called me earlier.
**Njepson**: He started his own glass company.
**Njepson**: So when you start sending him stuff, really?
**Njepson**: He said, I was like, well, how much can we do?
**Njepson**: He goes, man, I obviously, like can't do much because it's me fronting all the money.
**Njepson**: But he's like, I will give you guys pricing so you can compare it to stuff and if there's a way we can work certain things out.
**Njepson**: He said, anything, you know, like 4,000 square foot of glass and below I can handle as far as like, I'm the sole owner.
**Njepson**: He's the sole owner.
**Njepson**: Took his whole crew with him too.
**Njepson**: Yeah, I mean, and I love Logan.
**Njepson**: He's the only glass guy I've ever used.
**Njepson**: But apparently like.
**Njepson**: And there's some ownership discussions or the.
**Njepson**: Right.
**Njepson**: He told me this morning that the route diamond was going after David leaves, who's the owner, he's like, it didn't jive with the way he wanted it to go, so they left.
**Njepson**: He doesn't have a non computer, so we need to start.
**Njepson**: I told him to text me his email and we need to start sending him glass stuff, so.
**Ataylor**: But now the jobs we have, who's going to install this stuff?
**Njepson**: Well, so I have to use diamond at Crate because I have a contract.
**Ataylor**: Well, they also were low at Westfield.
**Njepson**: I think you should let him take a look at Westfield.
**Njepson**: Maybe figure out how you can help him start and probably get favorable pricing on the glass.
**Njepson**: Tell Logan, reach out to me and we'll figure out numbers.
**Njepson**: So I did.
**Njepson**: I told him, just send me his email and I'll send it out to everybody.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: Did you hear that, Glenn?
**Njepson**: Say again?
**Ataylor**: Did you hear all that?
**Njepson**: Yes.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Njepson**: Yeah, the glass.
**Njepson**: Yeah, the glass guy from Diamond.
**Ataylor**: Logan left.
**Njepson**: The glass guy that left Diamond.
**Njepson**: I.
**Njepson**: Yeah, I don't know.
**Njepson**: Logan.
**Njepson**: I'm.
**Njepson**: I have another guy from diamond that you sent me, AJ From Crate that I got a bid from for Westfield.
**Njepson**: But he's the.
**Njepson**: That's the owner David Lear.
**Njepson**: David.
**Njepson**: Yeah, David.
**Njepson**: So Logan, who's always been my guy.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: I sent you David's info because Logan, I got.
**Njepson**: He texted me and said he's no longer at at Diamond.
**Njepson**: I was like, what are you doing?
**Njepson**: And he said, stay tuned.
**Ataylor**: You ever want to know AJ's tight.
**Ataylor**: Just look at Logan.
**Ataylor**: Love him unabashedly.
**Njepson**: Love that guy.
**Njepson**: He's got me out of so many bonds.
**Njepson**: They're in the bondage.
**Njepson**: You were saying yourself, you said, is there up to a dollar amount he can.
**Njepson**: He can fund?
**Ataylor**: He's got so many handcuffs, I couldn't even tell you.
**Njepson**: But, man, that way it makes you tall.
**Njepson**: Aj.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: You said there was like a dollar amount he could front.
**Njepson**: Well, he just.
**Njepson**: I mean, he's a younger guy, so he can't.
**Njepson**: Obviously, if it's a, you know, million dollar contract, he probably.
**Njepson**: He probably needs some help with that because.
**Njepson**: Just because he can't.
**Njepson**: Doesn't have the money to do it yet.
**Njepson**: No, it's about a hundred thousand.
**Njepson**: Sounds like he needs a partner.
**Njepson**: Yeah, I would say so.
**Njepson**: That's.
**Njepson**: You know what's funny is I.
**Njepson**: Your smirk was like.
**Njepson**: I was visualizing it when he was calling it.
**Njepson**: But that smirk right there.
**Ataylor**: Aren't you mad he's gonna take your boyfriend away from it?
**Ataylor**: Like you won't leave.
**Njepson**: What?
**Ataylor**: Logan won't even know who you are anymore.
**Njepson**: He could still go release stress with you all day.
**Njepson**: Guys should be happy that I show.
**Njepson**: He's gonna do some baller prices.
**Njepson**: All right.
**Ataylor**: We left the most in the air.
**Ataylor**: One for last.
**Ataylor**: Ulta Dallas.
**Njepson**: You want to send me his info?
**Njepson**: Yes, I will when he sends it to me.
**Njepson**: I just talked to him.
**Njepson**: The most what in the air.
**Ataylor**: Ulta Dallas.
**Ataylor**: What are we doing there?
**Njepson**: Question.
**Ataylor**: So you found another steel sub that will do it or will not do it?
**Njepson**: I have two guys that will do it.
**Ataylor**: And how much is the.
**Njepson**: Perhaps just as much as the other guys, but I told him it was 40 and 80k more, so.
**Njepson**: So what are we waiting?
**Njepson**: Excuse me.
**Njepson**: They.
**Njepson**: They want me to go get another price.
**Ataylor**: Third price.
**Njepson**: A third price.
**Bclymer**: All right, well, that's not that hard.
**Njepson**: So.
**Njepson**: ABC Welding 116.
**Njepson**: That was my thought too.
**Ataylor**: I'll just have steel guy we're using on blooming.
**Njepson**: They're not gonna.
**Ataylor**: I know they won't.
**Ataylor**: That's why they'll give you a number for $500,000.
**Njepson**: Well, Fargo's smarter than that.
**Njepson**: They know.
**Njepson**: And.
**Njepson**: And they know, but.
**Njepson**: And then I owe Kelly Price, which I've been working on today, I gotta pull it together tomorrow.
**Njepson**: I told her, but she said, if you can do it for 300k, the job's yours.
**Njepson**: That's to move those two RTUs.
**Njepson**: But other than that lighting, we're.
**Njepson**: We don't even need to be there for the lighting.
**Njepson**: We're just there because they're looking for work.
**Njepson**: So we're squared away there.
**Njepson**: And like one I've ever gotten today was they were waiting for OPEX to stand up more wraps so they could keep going.
**Njepson**: So they're staying on their abs.
**Ataylor**: But like, when is this job starting back up?
**Njepson**: Started?
**Njepson**: It's already started.
**Ataylor**: I know, but without the steel, you can't finish it.
**Njepson**: We have to have the steel done by end of May.
**Njepson**: That's what they need.
**Njepson**: They want to hand you a third steel price before they pull the trigger.
**Njepson**: So I'm right.
**Njepson**: Like they're not.
**Njepson**: The ball's in their court.
**Njepson**: Like they have everything they need to make a decision.
**Njepson**: They're just wanting another price.
**Njepson**: So I'm like, oh, you're committed to getting a third price?
**Njepson**: I didn't reply to the email, but he sent it to me on Saturday.
**Njepson**: And then Drew was out of town today and said he'd call me.
**Njepson**: So I haven't.
**Njepson**: I haven't spoke to him since I saw him on Thursday.
**Njepson**: That should.
**Ataylor**: All right, that's it.
**Ataylor**: Any new jobs that we need to add for estimating?
**Ataylor**: Oh, yeah, the goodwill.
**Ataylor**: So add a new one for Goodwill foundation.
**Bclymer**: Office.
**Njepson**: Well, office build up.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: They bought a three story building, ground floor.
**Ataylor**: And.
**Ataylor**: And they're going to put their foundation department in it and have like charity events and stuff.
**Ataylor**: Ground floor.
**Njepson**: So that's back.
**Njepson**: Did I when I was at Peterson and eight projects.
**Njepson**: We put them in two years.
**Njepson**: Feel like we did that one when we were meeting with Rich and he's freaking out.
**Njepson**: And ever since then they don't.
**Njepson**: They're not even talking to other guys, are they?
**Bclymer**: No, they are.
**Njepson**: I mean, they got their corporate build out.
**Njepson**: Why are they using SHIELD it was above Jared said kid in those guys.
**Ataylor**: So we'll add a project in here that Andrew.
**Njepson**: This is like the.
**Njepson**: Andrew's the load man.
**Njepson**: Mulder.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: Jared is Andrew.
**Njepson**: Tara is a boss.
**Njepson**: Jared is Tara's boss.
**Njepson**: Brody is Jared's boss.
**Njepson**: Ken is Bertie's boss.
**Njepson**: So Ken chose to go with SHIELD Somewhere on there, somehow he's like, those the owner.
**Njepson**: They're on board or something?
**Njepson**: I'm not sure.
**Njepson**: Brody is the guy that I worked with in the IT and all the other Goodwills when you're doing like the ground.
**Njepson**: So he's the one that it.
**Njepson**: Why isn't we giving us stuff?
**Njepson**: I feel like we've done so much for kids.
**Njepson**: But like, you know, at the end of the day, like he's got a boss too, like.
**Bclymer**: And I'm not going to sit here.
**Njepson**: And, and throw a fit.
**Njepson**: You know, when we're getting all this kind of stuff, really, no questions asked.
**Njepson**: Right.
**Ataylor**: I'm just curious, is this adding a task here?
**Njepson**: Just add.
**Ataylor**: There we go.
**Njepson**: Indian.
**Ataylor**: Indian.
**Njepson**: This is a lot of work.
**Njepson**: There's foundations on in Roderickville.
**Njepson**: I didn't see it.
**Njepson**: I don't think so though.
**Ataylor**: Just finishing.
**Ataylor**: Gotta do refix some plumbing, fix some H Vac at a bunch of electrical outlets.
**Ataylor**: Lights.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, at least.
**Ataylor**: And then they may want to polish floors.
**Ataylor**: On first floor they got like they poured an inch and a half of concrete over the top of the wood subfloor on level 2 and 3.
**Njepson**: Why'd they do that?
**Ataylor**: I had no idea it was all cracking and I can't imagine the weight.
**Ataylor**: They had a plumber go through there and he cut like a 2 inch or 3 inch square hole through the bottom of one of the floors.
**Njepson**: That thing's just.
**Njepson**: You said this was an embroiderable.
**Ataylor**: That's what you call it?
**Ataylor**: That's fancy place with all the old ass building.
**Njepson**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: It's an old house.
**Njepson**: Oh, it's an old house.
**Ataylor**: I think it was an apartment possibly at one point.
**Njepson**: Yeah, it's, it's got, it's not a square.
**Ataylor**: It's in the job.
**Ataylor**: If you go to the job folder.
**Njepson**: My brother, I probably know exactly what I'm doing.
**Ataylor**: That's it.
**Njepson**: All right, thank you.
**Ataylor**: See ya.
**Bclymer**: Thank you, Jesse.
