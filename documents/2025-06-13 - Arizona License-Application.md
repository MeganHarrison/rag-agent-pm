**Jdawson**: All right, so let's do this.
**Jdawson**: So did Brandon let you know?
**Jdawson**: So Georgia was fixed.
**Jdawson**: So the person called back and then they were like, we just need to go here and register.
**Jdawson**: So Brandon did the registration, but they found us that we already sent everything.
**Jdawson**: So the status is good.
**Jdawson**: So we don't need to do anything else.
**Jdawson**: Just we can log into the Georgia with, you know, Brandon's email and the password and then check the status.
**Speaker 1**: But did they say we receive your package and everything is.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So you're not missing anything?
**Jdawson**: Nothing.
**Jdawson**: Because Brandon said is do we need to do anything else?
**Jdawson**: And then she was like, no, no, we received all the package.
**Jdawson**: What was missing was just kind of like create our profile on online so they can connect our profile to our license, you know, our license package.
**Jdawson**: So that's what she said.
**Jdawson**: No, you just need to connect it.
**Jdawson**: We didn't have it connected.

**Jdawson**: The Angeles and dck.
**Jdawson**: Right?
**Speaker 1**: Yep.
**Speaker 1**: And maybe like.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, maybe.
**Speaker 1**: Well, maybe put like because.
**Speaker 1**: And change these dates.
**Speaker 1**: I put the date I started the job, not the date I finished the job.
**Speaker 1**: So they're thinking like that when you fill this out, that shouldn't be 721.
**Speaker 1**: It should be like 723 over 24 rather.
**Jdawson**: So okay, so for valor.
**Jdawson**: So 2021.
**Jdawson**: 2023.
**Jdawson**: Well, 20.
**Speaker 1**: So for it just so you can write this down.

**Jdawson**: Okay, good.
**Jdawson**: So we can continue with that one.
**Jdawson**: And then when.
**Jdawson**: I cannot continue until I add all of these ones.
**Jdawson**: So let me do something.
**Jdawson**: So, for example, put here Valor Construction Group project start date of experience.
**Jdawson**: So we do need the start date.
**Jdawson**: So you said 07.
**Speaker 1**: So then.
**Speaker 1**: So then you just take.
**Speaker 1**: You start from the end of the previous job.
**Speaker 1**: So in this case.
**Jdawson**: So we cannot.
**Jdawson**: So yeah, so the start date will be the one you had right here.

**Jdawson**: Hands on and supervisor.
**Jdawson**: You want both or just supervisor?
**Speaker 1**: Add both is fine, I guess.

**Jdawson**: April 6th.
**Jdawson**: And then average.
**Jdawson**: Also over 40.
**Jdawson**: And then hand sign supervisor as well.
**Speaker 1**: So you only need two references on that or two work experience.
**Speaker 1**: Because that's over four years.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that's true.

**Jdawson**: So save and continue.
**Jdawson**: And then prior license disclosure information.
**Jdawson**: So it's loading.

**Speaker 1**: Yeah, the one is for Valor Capital.
**Jdawson**: So Baller Capital.
**Jdawson**: Do you have the license number for that one?
**Speaker 1**: Yep.
**Speaker 1**: Let me get this here because I had to send both these in with the Georgia applicant.
**Speaker 1**: So there in the folder, section 9.
**Speaker 1**: I got the license Valor.
**Speaker 1**: And then I have the license.
**Speaker 1**: Let me share this.
**Speaker 1**: So here's the one for Ballard Construction Group LLC.
**Jdawson**: One second.
**Jdawson**: So the number is GC 1531.
**Jdawson**: 1531.
**Jdawson**: So I think that's the one I put on the website.
**Jdawson**: We need to change it.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, you got their license number?
**Jdawson**: I think so.
**Jdawson**: Well, and then current status is active, correct?
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Speaker 1**: And that started in.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, from date.
**Speaker 1**: I'd have to look online and see when I got it.
**Speaker 1**: But it's been.
**Speaker 1**: Let me look.
**Jdawson**: And let me actually check if that's the one we have on the ly.
**Jdawson**: It's funny.
**Speaker 1**: Here's the other.
**Speaker 1**: I'll put the other one up for you, too.
**Jdawson**: Oh, no, I have the other one.
**Jdawson**: 1537.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, no, that's.
**Jdawson**: I have the little one.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Or wait, does the other one have issue date?
**Jdawson**: No, no.
**Speaker 1**: Because this was started in 2021 or two.
**Speaker 1**: So I just need to look online.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Expiration Day, August 31, 2026.
**Jdawson**: But this is.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, so this is to date.
**Jdawson**: August 21, 2026.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: It's just missing from date.
**Jdawson**: Oh, there it is.
**Jdawson**: Issued on August 27, 2024.
**Speaker 1**: That's not right.
**Jdawson**: That's not the right one.
**Speaker 1**: Well, maybe for Alito, but not for Valor.
**Jdawson**: No, but it says.
**Jdawson**: It says Ballard Construction group, issued on August 2017.
**Jdawson**: Oh, but that's not the right.
**Speaker 1**: That was the updated one.
**Jdawson**: Gotcha.
**Jdawson**: Makes sense.
**Speaker 1**: Originally licensed.
**Speaker 1**: So.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: 3 22, 2022.
**Jdawson**: Wait, wait, 3222-0223-2220-2022.
**Jdawson**: And let me show.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: March 22, 2022.
**Jdawson**: It says discipline and.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, and then I just want to make sure.
**Speaker 1**: On the Alito one.
**Speaker 1**: Where is this one was originally licensed 11 6, 2024.
**Jdawson**: 11 6.
**Jdawson**: But this is 2024 and then expires, I think in 2026.
**Jdawson**: I think so.
**Jdawson**: Something like that.
**Speaker 1**: So, yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So what they say?
**Speaker 1**: They said 11.
**Speaker 1**: So this is.
**Speaker 1**: They issued this on 11 18.
**Speaker 1**: But my.
**Speaker 1**: I was licensed on 11 6.
**Jdawson**: Wait one second.
**Jdawson**: This is a little original license and then expires on 8 31st, 2026.
**Speaker 1**: You got to renew everything at.
**Speaker 1**: By September.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Every two years.
**Speaker 1**: So I'll have to do continuing education.
**Speaker 1**: So it's also going to suck by all these states.
**Speaker 1**: I'll have to do that.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so let me share my screen now so you can see.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so classification and specialty.
**Jdawson**: What is the general constructor?
**Speaker 1**: We have general contractor.
**Jdawson**: Contractor, general contractor.
**Jdawson**: And then discipline against this prior license.
**Jdawson**: Has this license received any disciplinary action?
**Jdawson**: No, it's.
**Jdawson**: So that's good.
**Jdawson**: You see Dawson, Florida, Valor Capital, active in our contractor safe.
**Jdawson**: And then let's see if I can add another one.
**Jdawson**: Add prior license disclosure.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So Jesse Dawson, business name, Alito llc.
**Jdawson**: License number.
**Speaker 1**: I think it says for Tennessee.
**Jdawson**: No, for Florida.
**Jdawson**: This is the one from Alito.
**Jdawson**: 1537, 13 0.
**Jdawson**: Current status is active.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: General contractor and date.
**Jdawson**: And then you say 11 6, 1106 from 2024 to date.
**Jdawson**: 831 22.
**Jdawson**: And the answer is no.
**Jdawson**: Safe.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: You got to put the license number in there.
**Jdawson**: Here, this is the one.
**Jdawson**: Oh, no.
**Jdawson**: Style license is Indiana, Florida.
**Jdawson**: And this is a number.
**Speaker 1**: Did you put.
**Speaker 1**: No, no.
**Jdawson**: What.
**Speaker 1**: Now this is Florida.
**Jdawson**: Oh, by the way, we don't need a license because Brandon told me that for.
**Jdawson**: No, no, I'm sorry.
**Jdawson**: You need again.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, correct, correct.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: See, there you go.
**Jdawson**: So we have Florida.
**Jdawson**: Florida, a little LC and Valor Capital.
**Speaker 1**: Tennessee.
**Jdawson**: Ah, now Tennessee, right.
**Jdawson**: Jesse, you have a lot of licenses.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Business name is with Alito, correct?
**Speaker 1**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: And then license number for Tennessee.
**Jdawson**: I have it here.
**Speaker 1**: Ah, see, there you go.
**Jdawson**: Current status is active and classification specialty as general.
**Jdawson**: Should we put the Arizona?
**Jdawson**: They are cancel one.
**Jdawson**: But that's a temporary one, so I don't know.
**Speaker 1**: Do what?
**Jdawson**: Should we put the Arkansas.
**Jdawson**: Arkansa 1 Arkansas.
**Jdawson**: But that's a temporary.
**Jdawson**: That's a temporary license.
**Jdawson**: It doesn't matter.
**Speaker 1**: I wouldn't put it on there because.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, maybe.
**Jdawson**: Actually it's going to expire soon, so.
**Speaker 1**: All I got to do is take that business law class.
**Speaker 1**: The brand doesn't seem to care if we're licensed there, but it doesn't make sense to not just.
**Jdawson**: So it's a good expiration day.
**Jdawson**: This is June 30, 2027.
**Jdawson**: But I don't see the.
**Jdawson**: You don't.
**Jdawson**: You cannot see my window.
**Jdawson**: Once again, I need to share my screen with you.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so I see that the status is active and expiration.
**Jdawson**: That is June 30, 2027.
**Jdawson**: But did you remember the.
**Speaker 1**: Approved.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, one second.
**Jdawson**: I think we have it here because they send that both.
**Jdawson**: Remember, they send us the license certificate existing.
**Jdawson**: No, but this is different, right?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, no, there is a document that it sends.
**Jdawson**: No, no, that was the Arizona.
**Jdawson**: When I'm confused.
**Jdawson**: So when should we say it was added?
**Jdawson**: Expiration date is here, but it doesn't say.
**Jdawson**: When did we get it?
**Speaker 1**: I got the letter.
**Jdawson**: You got it?
**Jdawson**: June 9th, 2025.
**Jdawson**: Okay, I think I lost you.
**Jdawson**: Gotcha.
**Jdawson**: Perfect.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: June 9th, 2025.
**Jdawson**: Approve your contract.
**Jdawson**: Okay, sounds good.
**Jdawson**: And then to June 30th, 2027.
**Jdawson**: And has the license received any disciplinary.
**Jdawson**: No, Tennessee just doesn't save.
**Jdawson**: Okay, let me show my screen.
**Jdawson**: My screen.
**Jdawson**: Okay, that's good.
**Jdawson**: So we have these.
**Jdawson**: So we have three.
**Jdawson**: Genesee, Florida.
**Jdawson**: Florida, and then Georgia is still pending.
**Jdawson**: Okay.

**Jdawson**: It should be this one, correct?
**Jdawson**: No, One second.
**Jdawson**: No, no, no, no.
**Jdawson**: Is Arizona.
**Jdawson**: And I think Lisa sent us the bond for Arizona.
**Jdawson**: Where is the bond?
**Jdawson**: She did send it to us here.
**Jdawson**: But this is the bond number, not the policy number.
**Jdawson**: One second.
**Jdawson**: Actually, we should go with the coi, right.
**Jdawson**: Policy number, component deposit, accord.
**Jdawson**: And then.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, let's go with that one.
**Jdawson**: So your is our.
**Jdawson**: I think this is account.
**Jdawson**: What is accounting?
**Speaker 1**: I'm sorry, what are you looking for?
**Speaker 1**: Sorry?
**Jdawson**: For the policy number.
**Jdawson**: It's okay.
**Speaker 1**: We're looking for Workman's comp.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So it says, you know, the workers compensation insurance and then the company issuing the policy as a corp.
**Jdawson**: But the policy number is.
**Jdawson**: The name is the same one.
**Jdawson**: So it's this one.
**Jdawson**: So let me go to where is accounting?
**Jdawson**: And then we have a COI.
**Jdawson**: What is our COI?
**Jdawson**: COI.
**Jdawson**: And then Ch.
**Jdawson**: There's a bunch of COIs here.
**Jdawson**: But everything is under the same policy number, correct?
**Speaker 1**: Mm.
**Speaker 1**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: Oh, no.
**Jdawson**: The producer is ACV Insurance Inc.
**Jdawson**: And Indianapolis.
**Jdawson**: But what is it?
**Jdawson**: Where do you find the policy number?
**Speaker 1**: Work liability.
**Speaker 1**: Is that Workman's Here.
**Jdawson**: Workers Compensation Implementability.
**Jdawson**: And this is the policy number.
**Jdawson**: Do you see?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, so this is the one.
**Jdawson**: But then the company is ACV Insurance Inc.
**Jdawson**: No, a court.
**Jdawson**: Acv.
**Speaker 1**: All right.
**Jdawson**: And that's the policy number.
**Jdawson**: But it's acv, right?
**Jdawson**: Instead of Accord.
**Jdawson**: Accor is just the person the company.

**Speaker 1**: I can barely see it.
**Jdawson**: Sorry.
**Jdawson**: Me too.

**Jdawson**: This one.
**Jdawson**: So this is the workers compensation, right?
**Jdawson**: And then you see that it says the producer is ACB Insurance Inc.
**Jdawson**: Not accurate.
**Speaker 1**: Well, I think it's.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: ACB is the insurance agency.
**Jdawson**: So that's the one.
**Speaker 1**: But.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, because company issuing the policy.
**Jdawson**: Is this one correct?
**Speaker 1**: Well, I don't know.
**Speaker 1**: Is ACB the business and Accord is the insurance company or is a cord the business and ACB is the business.
**Jdawson**: And then because you see for example Lisa is the ACV insurance agent.
**Jdawson**: So I think they are issuing, you know, the insurance to us.
**Jdawson**: And then Accord is probably like a big brand, you know, like an umbrella name.
**Jdawson**: And look, insure Pennsylvania, that's just different.
**Jdawson**: I will put ACV insurance and then slash Accord or I will just leave it as ACV insurance.
**Speaker 1**: Well, no, which number, which policy number is each of those here?
**Jdawson**: The workers compensation policy number is this one.
**Jdawson**: Let's leave it ACV insurance.
