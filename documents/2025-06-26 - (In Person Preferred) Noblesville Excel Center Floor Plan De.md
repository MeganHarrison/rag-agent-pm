## Transcript
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: It.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: All right, can you guys see that screen that I'm sharing?
**Dstevens**: I just see a Goodwill logo.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Trying to figure out this new.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Where's everybody at?
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: They're not doing it in person.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: They're on.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: On the Internet.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: We're testing out the new Vibe build and all of its wonderful.
**Dstevens**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Features.
**Dstevens**: Real time noting.
**Jared.rains**: Can't wait to watch him struggle through it.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Actually, Zoom's being really annoying right now.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: What now?
**Dstevens**: Now we see it.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Sweet.
**Dstevens**: Look at all those cool pins.
**Dstevens**: Yeah.
**Cemery**: Hey, Andrew, I downloaded Vibe, but I don't know, like, I'm in it, but it says, can I join with a code?
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yes.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Let me share it with you.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Actually, in the meeting invite, there's a link that should take you to that, to the drawing.
**Cemery**: Okay.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: But there is a code now on the screen, if you can see that.
**Cemery**: Okay.
**Cemery**: Yeah, because it says request access.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Okay.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: The code is 728.
**Cemery**: Hold on, hold on, hold on.
**Cemery**: Okay.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: 728-567-8222.
**Cemery**: Says the code is invalid or you don't have access to this canvas.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Well, let me just share it with your email then.
**Cemery**: Yeah.
**Cemery**: Goodwill M.
**Cemery**: Henry at Goodwill Education.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: I must put dot com.
**Cemery**: Would you also mind changing so that.
**Cemery**: Unless you don't want me to edit it.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: No, I just missed that part.
**Jared.rains**: Okay.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Boom.
**Cemery**: Corey should be there.
**Cemery**: Is he there in person?
**Cemery**: He said he was walking.
**Cemery**: Yeah, yeah, that's what he said.
**Cemery**: He was going to walk in and try to find you guys, but he's.
**Jared.rains**: There walking in the wrong.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: So if you're on the Vibe app, you should be able to see any of the drawings that is happening.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Oh, hey, Jared just went to find you lost in the woods out there.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Well, this is great.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: I love this space.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah, we just redid it.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: This is.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Hopefully this is going to be pretty.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: This is pretty easy.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Do I need to get mar.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Okay.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: So normally I'd have the camera on.
**Jared.rains**: But it would just be the top of the head.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Makes sense.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: I'm sure there was a much easier way to get back here.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah, you can't actually see us.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: So these red marks already, just based on what you guys have talked about so far?
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yep.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: The marks are what I have already written down.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Okay.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah, I know there's the bathrooms for the YOC and the bathrooms at the top, and the bathroom's in the middle.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Is that just plumbing?
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Is.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: What is the current plumbing and how much of that is, like, can't move, it's stuck.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Versus so we already ported this one in.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: So the basically I don't know if you've seen this building yet, but it's just a wide open.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Big lots, right.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Bathrooms are here, I believe.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Okay.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: So just as a cost effective measure, just putting it close to that four cuts.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: But if it doesn't.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: If it's better to have it somewhere else, it's.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: So this is just kind of just like understood.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: I've been in some of these drawings where it's like, please don't.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah, yeah, it's a trench or whatever.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah, this.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: This is pretty much wide open and we can make it however we want.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Okay.
**Dstevens**: Yeah, we're gonna have to cut to get up to some of the front bathrooms anyway, so.
**Dstevens**: Yeah, putting the bathrooms wherever you want.
**Dstevens**: We can handle that.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: And that's Jesse and Nick from Alina as well.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Very good.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: And then that was one question I had just coming in.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: And then the square footage of the classrooms along that wall are like 500 square feet.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: And I think we've been aiming at like 700.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Okay, so this is really small.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah, we.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: But I know we have only so much space to work with.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah, well, kind of.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: We can actually take up however much space we want.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah, but yeah, again, this is just kind of what Jesse put together is just like a starting point.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: So none of this is set in stone or anything.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Do you have a total number of classrooms that you want here?
**Cemery**: 2, 3, 4, 5.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Are you looking at your current floor plan here?
**Cemery**: I'm looking at the one that Steve and I used.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Oh, yeah, you guys.
**Cemery**: At least.
**Cemery**: At least nine, if possible.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Okay, so class care.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Almost got.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Is that.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Miriam, is that classrooms used for office space also?
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Is that within that 9 on Steve's drawing?
**Cemery**: Yeah, I.
**Cemery**: I don't.
**Cemery**: Yeah.
**Cemery**: Is it helpful maybe for me to just share what.
**Cemery**: What our ideas are and then we can talk about square footage and where things work and don't work.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah.
**Jared.rains**: That'S all I really want to know.
**Jared.rains**: Or an rvr.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Okay.
**Cemery**: Can you see my laser pointer?
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yep.
**Cemery**: Oh, okay.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: We're vibing.
**Cemery**: All right, so just kind of an overall thought process is Steve talked about he went to go visit a couple current sites and really likes the idea of the student lounge being in the middle.
**Cemery**: Like Anderson and Grant county both.
**Cemery**: And so the first.
**Cemery**: The first edit would say taking out this whole middle.
**Cemery**: Let me rephrase that.
**Cemery**: Not taking everything out.
**Cemery**: But let me find the marker, the pen.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Okay, but students, the one switch.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Right.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Is move the while so see where the student lodges.
**Jared.rains**: Correct.
**Cemery**: No, you have the.
**Cemery**: No, you have the ylcc, which is right here.
**Cemery**: He wants to keep that daycare there, keep the YLCC there.
**Cemery**: But this becomes two classrooms.
**Cemery**: And then this all goes away and becomes just a big open, like the student lounge area here.
**Cemery**: All of this goes away, and then you have your director's office.
**Cemery**: And so just like at Noblesville or not Noblesville, like Anderson, there's that wall right here.
**Cemery**: Right.
**Cemery**: That separates this little, like, hallway between the director's office and the lounge.
**Cemery**: And then the student lounge is in here.
**Cemery**: I'll erase all my stuff too.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: No, that's.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: That's fine.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: So you.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: You want a walkway here.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: So you don't just want it to be open.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Okay.
**Cemery**: I mean, like, it would be open here and here.
**Cemery**: Right.
**Cemery**: But just like a wall that separates, like this director's office and have it.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Outside those, like, Muncie classrooms in between that and the student lounge.
**Cemery**: Like, if you think Anderson.
**Jared.rains**: Okay, those are all based off of an MOA desk kind of in front of them, right?
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah, yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: It's a similar here, but here we're dealing with the squeeze skinny or skinny injury.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: I don't win it.
**Jared.rains**: Yeah, Anderson's the closest.
**Jared.rains**: Any like that skinny.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: We can make this whatever we want for sure.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: So the.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Whatever you want it to look like, we can totally destroy the whole thing and.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: And do it from new, which is fine.
**Cemery**: Let me just.
**Cemery**: Andrew, I just wonder if this might be more helpful.
**Cemery**: I can email you the mock up that Steve and I did.
**Cemery**: I don't know if that's helpful.
**Cemery**: Instead of trying to, like, transition everything.
**Jared.rains**: Jesse, did this design come from you?
**Dstevens**: Yeah, we just.
**Dstevens**: Yeah, we just tried to take half of the space and fit the classrooms and offices and daycare into it, just to have something to start with.
**Jared.rains**: So were there any utilities, any chases, anything that we needed to be cognizant about working around?
**Dstevens**: I don't think so, because it was just a.
**Dstevens**: It started off as I could think a grocery store.
**Dstevens**: And so there's really.
**Dstevens**: No.
**Jared.rains**: Pretty wide open.
**Dstevens**: It's wide open.
**Dstevens**: Yeah.
**Dstevens**: We can do whatever you want with the space.
**Dstevens**: I think there was a comment about having windows.
**Dstevens**: So the classrooms that have a window, so we tried to put most of them along the outside wall.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: To give that, like the transom windows.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah.
**Cemery**: The other thing is that he wants this down here to be the staff lounge and then two staff bathrooms over here with the entrance in this little hallway, like making a little hallway with that classroom.
**Cemery**: So this is embarrassing to watch all this happen.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: It's hard on a computer with mask.
**Jared.rains**: I want you to know we're all standing around judging you.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: I know.
**Cemery**: Oh, I'm gonna.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah.
**Cemery**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: So this looks better.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: So this is the staff restroom.
**Cemery**: Yeah.
**Cemery**: Where's the eraser on this thing?
**Cemery**: When I see it.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Oh, everything's permanent.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Y.
**Jared.rains**: I feel a little bit like we probably just need this start over.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah, we can just totally start over.
**Jared.rains**: Center in the doorway with the mo desk in front or off to the side like we have and start to build around that.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah, that'd be fine.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Okay, that's what it sounds like.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Just scrap this whole idea and then.
**Dstevens**: Have you developed like a standard?
**Dstevens**: Like your staff lounge is typically 600 whatever, 400ft or 200ft, anything like that.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: I don't know if we have a size field staff lounge in the spec.
**Jared.rains**: Corey and Marion, like would you say Grant County, Bartholomew county or those?
**Jared.rains**: I mean, obviously Nobles be a little bit bigger.
**Jared.rains**: Can you use.
**Cemery**: Could you say that again, Jared?
**Cemery**: I'm having a hard time hearing you.
**Jared.rains**: No, I mean, I know Noblesville is probably going to be a little bit bigger, but our Grant county and Bartholomew county are those good like starting points that we mimicked the size of the student lounge and mimic the size of the stat lounge or you think that's not close?
**Cemery**: I have not been to Bartholomew since it's been updated, but I would say yes, for Grant county is a good starting spot from size differential.
**Jared.rains**: We could share those plans with.
**Cemery**: Yeah, Jesse, I think the average classroom size Grant was like 650 or something like that.
**Cemery**: Like 500 was like one of the smallest rooms.
**Jared.rains**: 550 or 650.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: But since this one's wide open, we can really do whatever's needed because Grant was just kind of what, fit for sure.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: I really want to maximize the space so that way leasable space is maximized.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: You know what I mean?
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: So like I'm comfortable with a tight.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Like I'm not looking for eight foot hallways.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: I'm going to call just because there is space because the more we can lease, the more better for everything.
**Jared.rains**: What's the size of this one?
**Jared.rains**: Is this 12, 5.
**Jared.rains**: 13 5.
**Jared.rains**: Original quality.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Jesse, you remember this size square footage.
**Dstevens**: We'Re showing 105ft by 132.
**Dstevens**: That's 13,860 what we drew.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: That's.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: It has a 300.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: So the Anderson from floor plan.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: I'd actually like to like how close.
**Jared.rains**: Can we get to size wise?
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Well, just.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Just what?
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Like what we put down in Anderson.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Like open the MOA desk offices down that side, classrooms down the sun, YLCC in the back.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Like, I.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: That floor plan is my favorite one we've ever done.
**Cemery**: You're welcome.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah, I like the bios and see it's far away from the entrance and having their own exit that no one else can like.
**Jared.rains**: I love personal security scene.
**Jared.rains**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: That's all I think about.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Security.
**Jared.rains**: I just know we've had conversations in the past where some people say we don't want to trudge strollers all the way down.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: But like, places like Shabby coast and.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Hello.
**Jared.rains**: Oh, absolutely.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Like, I understand the glass in the corner.
**Dstevens**: Yeah, yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: But one bad driver coming down the street, those kids are done.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Like, so do you want a separate entrance or like an attached entrance?
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: So just say this is the YLCC with a door onto the exterior or.
**Jared.rains**: Does that introduce more safety issues and.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Kids getting at.
**Jared.rains**: Trying to think, is that Muncie?
**Cemery**: That has it.
**Cemery**: Grant county has one.
**Cemery**: Yeah.
**Cemery**: It's helpful if they like, I don't know.
**Cemery**: Is that emptying into a parking lot over there?
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah, there's a.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: What's a.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: I think it's just an alley.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Like a driveway through there.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah.
**Dstevens**: On the right side.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah.
**Dstevens**: It's like a little alley.
**Dstevens**: I think there's some parking.
**Dstevens**: Parallel parking.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: It's a.
**Jared.rains**: It's 20ft wide.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: It's not narrow, is there?
**Cemery**: I'm just thinking, like, if they take the kids out to play.
**Cemery**: Right.
**Cemery**: Like, is there grass back there or is this just.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: No, not really.
**Jared.rains**: No.
**Jared.rains**: That would be something I would say.
**Jared.rains**: Mary.
**Jared.rains**: I'm just taking kids out to play.
**Jared.rains**: Street like this.
**Jared.rains**: That's not what I expect from you.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: There is a little area back here that's off the road, so you could put a door there so it just doesn't open straight up into the drive.
**Jared.rains**: If you wanted that additional parking met.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: There and rewind right here.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: It's.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: There's a overhead door and another door that's on the other space.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: But it's.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: It's not really parking.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: It's just kind of like an open loading area.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: So we started at the front door.
**Jared.rains**: Did more of an open style MOA desk.
**Jared.rains**: We have a foyer.
**Jared.rains**: We're building a foyer into this in the security space.
**Jared.rains**: If we do an open MOA desk.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Because if the door moved, that just permanently there.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah, yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: If the door was here.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Vestibule, second set of doors, giveaway desk wall, student lounge at some level.
**Jared.rains**: Right.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: And then down.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Right.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Director.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah, that's a.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Some level.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: I don't know, space wise But I do like the class or the.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: The classrooms on this side.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: So I actually would go against like, Flip Anderson.
**Cemery**: Then where's on the left side?
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Well, it's gone now.
**Jared.rains**: Wherever you want it.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: There's no.
**Cemery**: Oh, we can make it bigger.
**Jared.rains**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: But if we stick to that 14,000, we can even offset this a little bit just to move.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: So these offices look a little more.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: I don't want to make these huge just because we centered that.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: You know what I mean?
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: And then have classrooms still run up this edge or however long.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: We're going to run out of square footage pretty fast.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Rooms there, but 700 square feet.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah, shoot for six to 700.
**Jared.rains**: If you leave this open, you can still do a classroom kind of similar to the way Anderson.
**Cemery**: Yes.
**Cemery**: There is a.
**Cemery**: There is a request to put those two rooms in the middle.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: And from us.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Scale sucks right now, but I think in Steve's drawing, I mean, it looked like a massive open area and two classrooms in the size of like 250 square foot is what Steve left for himself there.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: But.
**Cemery**: No.
**Cemery**: Nope.
**Cemery**: Is it Who's.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: I'm not running Steve's floor plan for the next 20 years where no one has offices.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: You know what I.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah, yeah.
**Cemery**: It's different what you and I talked about, but that's fine.
**Jared.rains**: You want this 18,000, you want 15,000, you want to select all the classroom sizes and see what's left.
**Jared.rains**: The tenants that we have lined up now, you could probably go 18,000 and still.
**Jared.rains**: You could probably go 20,000, I think, and still be fine with the space that's left open.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Because Kenley said folks were dying to.
**Jared.rains**: Get in here too.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Right.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: So that shouldn't be easy to flip.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Or was that just an urgency ploy from him to get us to move?
**Jared.rains**: He didn't really necessarily care.
**Jared.rains**: What he knows is we had already talked to the food pantry.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah.
**Jared.rains**: And pork lawn or whatever.
**Jared.rains**: And they're super interested in moving out with you.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah.
**Jared.rains**: So those are probably the two most immediate tenants that we could line up pretty quickly.
**Jared.rains**: Probably still somewhat meet our mission and recoup some cost for you, for sure.
**Jared.rains**: We just haven't had them any of those conversations yet until we devise your space and said this is what's going to be.
**Dstevens**: And just one thought on existing bathrooms, which I don't know that they would be used by the other tenant.
**Dstevens**: And Andrew, if you have the.
**Dstevens**: Do you have that original set that we found and scanned in?
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: I do, but not that I can get up here quickly.
**Dstevens**: I can share real quick.
**Dstevens**: Just show you.
**Dstevens**: That looks like.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Let's see here.
**Dstevens**: I think.
**Dstevens**: I don't know where the share button is.
**Jared.rains**: Andrew probably didn't give it to you.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Did too.
**Jared.rains**: Oh, there we go around here somewhere.
**Jared.rains**: Where'd the picture in picture come?
**Dstevens**: Yeah, I think you have to just disable yours.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Trying to.
**Dstevens**: There you go.
**Dstevens**: Are you able to see this?
**Jared.rains**: Yeah.
**Dstevens**: So, like, these are the existing bathrooms.
**Dstevens**: I think we were trying to stay on this side of it, but you could also just notch this to allow this space if they need to use these or I don't know if these just go away for whatever tenant you would have over here.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: It didn't show up on our board because our zoom was doing some weird stuff.
**Dstevens**: Is that Sharon?
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: No, I had something on our end.
**Dstevens**: All right, I'll let you.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Cherry.
**Dstevens**: Here's in.
**Dstevens**: It's not working.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: No.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Something with the board.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: I mean, this board is awesome and doesn't have any problems.
**Jared.rains**: Shouldn't have drink most of the paper someday we'll learn how to use it one day.
**Jared.rains**: What you have for sure.
**Jared.rains**: Be prepared for the future.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: That's a key of walking into a tiny lab at this point in our careers and trajectory would be a fail on all of us.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: For the moa.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Since it's got a secure vestibule, can that be open the MOA desk?
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Similar to.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Similar to Anderson.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Okay.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Now, so.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah, we didn't reflect it in this, like first bad draw.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: But yeah, that should flow closer to the.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Wherever these offices end up being.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Okay.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: This is the main entrance now where it has two doors that come in.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: And these are just block walls.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: So that's.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah, we can put a door anywhere every.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: It's fine here.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: I can play with it again.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: And Miriam, you can.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: That's this one.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: So like, whatever that.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: I don't.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Of course, not to scale, but like if the door of the office was right off the vestibule and the vestibule is like this front door.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: MOA desk with a wall opening up to the lounge.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: We then have like room for a conference room on this side of the vestibule or an office.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: And then building the classrooms.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: And then, you know, as it opens up to the lounge, we now get this space back for more classrooms and then figure out bathroom, storage, etc.
**Jared.rains**: In the corner in there somewhere.
**Jared.rains**: Maybe bathrooms in there.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah.
**Cemery**: There is a.
**Cemery**: I mean, if.
**Cemery**: If possible there was a request to have bathrooms like in the middle and not in the back.
**Jared.rains**: I think if we did I don't like the idea of having the open break room in the middle and then on the backside of that having the bathrooms.
**Jared.rains**: And then if we could still get those classrooms behind that to, like, line up down the center, I think that flows really well.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: And Miriam, what do you think about putting the coach space right off this open to the lounge like we've done?
**Cemery**: Yeah, I think.
**Cemery**: I mean, where I'm just struggling with this feels very.
**Cemery**: Is it supposed to be off center?
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah.
**Cemery**: So then what's all this space over here?
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Well, scale is failing me right now.
**Cemery**: But I hear you.
**Cemery**: I just.
**Cemery**: I'm having trouble visualizing what you're saying.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah, it's off center because my bad.
**Cemery**: Pull that back.
**Jared.rains**: How'd you do that?
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: And what the hell was that?
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: I just put a white square over that belting.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: That was amazing.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: That was amazing.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah, it's off center to reflect.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: So that way we don't have this pressure to make these massive offices on this one side.
**Cemery**: But I think, oh, well, okay.
**Jared.rains**: But in the left and right is off center.
**Jared.rains**: But everything would still line up down the middle.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah, yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: You'd still get to the middle post, the MOA wall.
**Cemery**: But to your point, Corey, making the classrooms bigger than the classrooms on this.
**Cemery**: These are our main classrooms in Anderson.
**Cemery**: These are really big classrooms over here.
**Cemery**: Right.
**Cemery**: So they come out further to the middle.
**Cemery**: And then these are skinny classrooms, which I think is fine.
**Cemery**: Is that what you're saying?
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: And then you get like T O r.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Sure.
**Cemery**: But the off the wall for the MOA is still in the middle.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Correct.
**Cemery**: You just stack these more.
**Cemery**: Okay.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: So it's not a whole lot different than that layout as far as.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Correct.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: These are.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: This being.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: This being classrooms.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: And then this open.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: And this was already an off center entrance.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: So just reworking this to make that MOA area with the conference room.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: And then this be more office space here off that vestibule entrance, YLCC in the back.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: And then maximizing classroom space here, maybe office space on the edge.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: That way the coaches have direct access.
**Cemery**: I think there was.
**Cemery**: There was a request to have, like, coaches here and then a classroom with a computer lab here.
**Cemery**: So from like an electricity standpoint, I guess, to have this be the computer lab so that.
**Cemery**: And then like the request we can nix this, but is that this wall right here is like a half glass wall so that coaches can look in here to see what's happening and proctor things if necessary.
**Cemery**: But then coaches are right off the student lounge.
**Cemery**: That's right here.
**Cemery**: If you want coaches in the middle or resource room or something, maybe there's a resource.
**Cemery**: I don't know how big this space is going to be, but this could also be a resource room or like a.
**Cemery**: Which is a classroom, sorry, resource.
**Cemery**: And then coaches here, if that's what you're thinking.
**Cemery**: Corey.
**Cemery**: I don't know.
**Cemery**: I don't know how big that space in the middle is going to be.
**Cemery**: And then the lounge here.
**Jared.rains**: I think you need to be closer to 15,000 square feet to get some of those things.
**Jared.rains**: If we want.
**Cemery**: What'd you say?
**Cemery**: I'm sorry.
**Jared.rains**: I think you're going to need to be closer to 15,000 square feet to get some of those things.
**Jared.rains**: If you want that kind of layout.
**Jared.rains**: I have a feeling we're going to need a little bit more width to be able to.
**Jared.rains**: Since we don't have more depth, a little bit more width to make all those work.
**Cemery**: Okay.
**Cemery**: Yeah.
**Cemery**: And again, like, Anderson is long, right.
**Cemery**: And we kind of flipped Grant county also to be skinny.
**Cemery**: And it's w.
**Cemery**: It's wide.
**Cemery**: Right.
**Cemery**: So, yeah, depending on what is needed here, I think that's okay, too.
**Jared.rains**: I would have guessed like a hundred, but this is 100.
**Jared.rains**: Sitting at 100 right now.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Because if it's close, I mean, just drop that shutter right on top of it.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah, flip it and drop.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Like, if it's close, I make a weird.
**Jared.rains**: It's as close as you want to be.
**Jared.rains**: I mean, it's definitely not going to have the depth.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: 100.
**Jared.rains**: Yeah, but you can have as much width as you want.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: That's right.
**Jared.rains**: But because you don't have the depth.
**Jared.rains**: That's why I'm thinking you probably need to go a little wider to be able to get all those things in the middle.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: But Anderson serves like 75 more students.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: And so, like, thinking about classroom, number of classrooms, number of offices.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: I mean, that's why I feel like it.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Even if Anderson's 2,000 more square feet or 4, whatever, like, that squeeze should be pretty easy.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Should be.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: If the width is comparable as we just cut the depth off and see where that leaves us, you know.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Miriam, do you have any thoughts about that?
**Cemery**: I'm sorry, say that one more time.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: That was a long paragraph.
**Jared.rains**: I hope you remember it.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Like, how wide was Anderson?
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Because if.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: If it's close to this width or within, like, my.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: My thought is, is if we could replicate the depth or the floor plan of Anderson and cut off some of the depth of Anderson on this floor plan.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: I mean, the difference in who Anderson is serving compared to Doublesville should make that cut off fine.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: I'm just trying to get to a measurement.
**Cemery**: Yeah, I think that's fine.
**Cemery**: I think that to your point Corey though the only thing you said was to flip classrooms with like the left side of the hall and the right side of the hall flipping that for what Anderson currently is.
**Cemery**: Right?
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Jesse, is this doing a lounge similar to bart BART size.
**Dstevens**: Let me see real quick.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: I don't know if you just took that measurement off here or not or just made this but that red square would be the same student lounge size.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: So you could still fit.
**Dstevens**: Okay.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: So you'd still fit all that stuff up there or in the middle.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Whatever you want to do here would still still fit pretty well.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: No, they moved out.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Well did they move out Anderson?
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Are they using that space for storage still or something?
**Jared.rains**: But they move downstairs or Henderson but left stuff upstairs though in Noblesville.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Nov does not have.
**Jared.rains**: They don't come from.
**Jared.rains**: We could probably send Jesse the drawings.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah.
**Jared.rains**: Say replicate it in the space and then circle back.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: You know how many offices you guys want here?
**Dstevens**: You say that's the Anderson you want to replicate here.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Correct.
**Jared.rains**: As much as you can.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah.
**Dstevens**: The BART student lounge looks to be a little bigger than this here.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Okay.
**Dstevens**: 30 probably feet by 30ft.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Nice.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: There are Bobby into student window.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: It's a really nice.
**Jared.rains**: Kind of looking the space too.
**Cemery**: I know this is a dumb question, but I assume you guys have the Anderson floor plan because I just found it.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: I am looking for it right now.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Do you have it?
**Cemery**: Yes.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Can you send it over?
**Cemery**: Sure.
**Jared.rains**: Yes.
**Jared.rains**: It is wallpaper.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: For the trophy basketball player.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Literally is my favorite.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: It makes a straight line for you.
**Jared.rains**: Look at that.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: How fancy that is.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: If we make those restrooms next to the other bathrooms, that'll help.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: That's true.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: They're not going there, are they?
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Scratch that.
**Jared.rains**: You see that was fix look that.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: It was never there.
**Jared.rains**: Well, at least we know we've got it someplace.
**Jared.rains**: Trying to replicate it.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah.
**Jared.rains**: Minus the sparrows by the way.
**Jared.rains**: Staircase right door at the top of the stairs.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: That's that flanges very large measurement on this.
**Jared.rains**: Well, it's not rewind.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: And that's.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: That's it flange.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Right.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: I mean for this.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: What offices on that side.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: That's off center like we were drawing here.
**Jared.rains**: For the classroom sizes there are good.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: They're massive.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Massive classroom sizes probably.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: The ones in the left.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: So instead of the staircase here in this floor plan, this is where we can bump out Two classrooms maybe in this kind of space or something.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: And then another one this time before you get to the.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yes.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Anderson has very few teachers for how big they are, so the class based need is not as high.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: But what I like about the Anderson floor plan too is you go like director and then the TOR has bigger space to have students working in there.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: And then these offices off the middle is what Miriam was talking about here, where instead of this lab up here, it kind of comes down here and.
**Jared.rains**: It'S a little smaller.
**Jared.rains**: Yeah, that computer climate ambush is massive.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: More classrooms, little pill box.
**Jared.rains**: Yeah, it's got a beautiful view though.
**Jared.rains**: Like his trees out front in the atrium.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: The dusty ones.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jared.rains**: I don't know if I cleared anything up.
**Jared.rains**: They gave it a great place.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Good starting point.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: I mean, we could not just cut it this way.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: We can have it all this way too.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Right.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: To fit that a little easier in it then rent out that back area.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: But yeah, it's a good starting point.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Did you have a total office number that you wanted?
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Oh, sorry, Director for sure.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Combined coach office.
**Cemery**: Yeah.
**Cemery**: Which is essentially just like half the size of a classroom, right?
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah, just a office space that's big enough for two people there.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: LTLC can share.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Lt lc CCR can share.
**Cemery**: Yes.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Like we have a danger.
**Cemery**: Do you want it?
**Cemery**: He has three TORs.
**Cemery**: But I don't know if they need a complete office because I don't want to.
**Cemery**: You know, I think in all of the.
**Cemery**: What happens in most EXCEL centers, Corey.
**Cemery**: And this has happened, I think in Anderson and Grant and I'm thinking about other smaller schools.
**Cemery**: I don't know, west also it happens the Tor, specifically because they're also teaching.
**Cemery**: Just their classroom becomes their office.
**Cemery**: You know, like think about Luis and Troy.
**Cemery**: Like they don't have an TOR office.
**Cemery**: They just use their classrooms.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah, I hear Wes is not an example I want to think about.
**Cemery**: Yeah, no, that's fine.
**Cemery**: But also thinking like.
**Cemery**: I hear you, but like Jack and Becky at Grant, they just.
**Cemery**: They don't have separate TOR offices.
**Cemery**: Right.
**Cemery**: They just use their classrooms to teach from.
**Cemery**: And also because most of the time they're teaching.
**Cemery**: So I mean, if we want to have them, if there's space for them to have their own office, I think that's fine.
**Cemery**: But if there's not space, the majority of them can just be in their classrooms.
**Cemery**: I don't know, Corey, what your thoughts are.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah, I agree.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: If space is limiting to not sure to not do that.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: I.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: I just, I want to move us closer and Closer just operationally to what James has been doing in Michigan street, where no one really owns an office or a classroom.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: It's based on where students need to be and where those teachers need to be.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: And putting an office person in a classroom just cuts off off assets in the classroom or like it, it changes the relationship.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: So if we can get space dedicated for them to serve students all day long, whether it's in the classroom or the office, that's the ideal.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: But if space doesn't make that possible, then classrooms where it is, it's just then do all three Tor share classroom or there's three half day schedules spread across two classrooms.
**Cemery**: What if, Corey, what if there's that resource room in the middle?
**Cemery**: You know, like at Anderson, how Martha is in the resource room right there in the middle.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah.
**Cemery**: Like that could be the Tor resource room.
**Cemery**: Like Steve wanted Audrey to be there anyway in that research room.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: That could work.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: For sure.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: For sure.
**Cemery**: And so there is no specific like two our office.
**Cemery**: The two Rs each have a classroom.
**Cemery**: But then there's the resource room, which is like what you're talking about, Corey.
**Cemery**: A space that's not a full classroom that can be smaller.
**Cemery**: Which is why we want like an idea for the resource room to be off the student lounge.
**Cemery**: Like that in the middle is so that it doesn't have to be the full size of a classroom, but you can still serve students in it at all times.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: For sure.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: So when Carolyn does geometry periods one and two, she floats into the resource room to do ILPs, to meet with students to pull out.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Right.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: My concern is if Carolyn has a classroom, then what does that classroom do in the back?
**Cemery**: What does the classroom do?
**Cemery**: What.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: What does that classroom function is for the rest of the day?
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Is that something Octavia serves when Carolyn's not doing it?
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: And so there's immersions instruction all day.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: That's why like tying a T of any teacher to a classroom right now is something I want figure out how to move the.
**Cemery**: I think in the drawing though, that.
**Cemery**: I think in the drawing we gave Carolyn and Octavia their own classrooms and a resource room.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Right.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: With 500 square feet classrooms.
**Cemery**: Oh, I see what you're saying.
**Cemery**: Okay.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Right.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: So we got to figure out how to maximize space so we can't have a class 30 where needed.
**Cemery**: Okay.
**Cemery**: Yep, I gotcha.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: You know what I mean?
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: The best teachers with the most students in the biggest space is the math.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: I mean, directors working with non.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Well, that's just where Grant works.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Even though it might be the biggest.
**Jared.rains**: Room with five students.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: It's almost crammed 30 with the five.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: So the resource room would fit three people like three desks.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah, I hear what Miriam's saying.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Let's.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Let's do what we've said like let's try to overlay Anderson on it as much as possible.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Flip the floor plan of Anderson and fit it in there and then I think that that draft will be much better for us.
**Cemery**: If you look Andrew at the Anderson's drawing, the coach's office it says coaches one I think right behind the student or the break room in the middle.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah.
**Cemery**: 226 that is currently a resource room.
**Cemery**: That's like the size of the roof and it fits.
**Cemery**: There are three, two or three desks in there.
**Cemery**: I mean it's tight but there are two at least two desks in there but.
**Cemery**: And then coaches two is also the admin office.
**Cemery**: Office in Anderson so whatever.
**Cemery**: It's pretty big actually.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: So one, one for director, one for inviting and then the Federac then.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: And then resource would take the need for any TOR list because to your point we can figure out how to share the program.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: The classroom is.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Do we put desks in the resource room just so they have landing spot.
**Cemery**: There are two in there.
**Cemery**: Yeah.
**Cemery**: Two staff desk and then there's like three student tables also in there.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: So if we could just replicate the size.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: I'll share this room for the resource.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: We have a impact there.
**Cemery**: So really I would also say.
**Cemery**: Well maybe never mind.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Really.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Director is over that has their offices.
**Jared.rains**: Can't wait for the request to.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Well she's got Steve's room to flip into that configuration actually we probably don't need a vestibule because it already has one in the front or you just have.
**Jared.rains**: Switch out to the hardware.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah like a grocery store or.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yes.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: I don't know.
**Jared.rains**: We had some.
**Jared.rains**: I'm not sure anyway so yeah they're not saving at least the structures.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: So you have one single office with the director and then one combined office with two coaches and two combined offices with.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: That's not a simple answer.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: That covers every flip to Anderson version.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: See what that looks like in here.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Is there anything else specific wise like having a wild CC entrance that.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Do we want that or if it's only required.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: What do you mean like a wireless.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Like a door?
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Exit.
**Jared.rains**: Yeah I'd say we try to put the egress in there.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: I don't know fire in the wood situator but I just think it's good picking out A fire off for us.
**Jared.rains**: Yeah.
**Jared.rains**: We can do crash things just to make sure we can decide whether it's class or people.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Because if.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: If we don't do that, that's where we.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: We get in the business of buying cribs with like all road wheels.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Right.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: And throwing kids in there and roll with them to attention.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Burning the mil and that's.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: That's what trying to prevent.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: We've got good but I don't like it.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: I'm waiting for wheel to break on.
**Jared.rains**: The sidewalk evacuation just to dump a child out.
**Jared.rains**: Awesome.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: I can send this as a PDF to everybody too and then we'll get Anderson.
**Jared.rains**: Sweet.
**Dstevens**: Okay.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Well all right.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Thanks everybody.
**Dstevens**: Yeah.
**Dstevens**: And what is the timeline currently for next week?
**Dstevens**: Next week.
**Dstevens**: Okay.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Summer.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: The summer for what, 20.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Oh, yeah.
**Jared.rains**: Middle of summer.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Look at looking to start the school year year in a building in July.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: But I know there's this conversation about dual rent and how that works and if that means to speed up the construction of timeline, potentially we're already paying for it.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: But that was a raw K conversation I just had.
**Jared.rains**: So.
**Jared.rains**: Yeah, nobody.
**Jared.rains**: Nobody wants to pay for anything twice.
**Jared.rains**: But let's get the layout done.
**Jared.rains**: That'll be able a chance to previous event door of and then we can figure out what is that schedule.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah.
**Jared.rains**: Don't want to rush everybody and don't want to come down to the last final minutes like after we get you in there.
**Jared.rains**: Want to time it.
**Jared.rains**: Time it well.
**Jared.rains**: And I'm certain if we got down to the start of next year and we said we needed a month or two.
**Jared.rains**: The Chancellor's not going out.
**Jared.rains**: So not worried about that too much.
**Jared.rains**: Two spaces at the same time.
**Jared.rains**: Which in all honesty, we may be able to go back to the Chancellor and say we're going to get out of here a little early.
**Jared.rains**: Like what.
**Jared.rains**: What can we do that?
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah, that's what Katie was thinking this morning.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: It's got to be.
**Jared.rains**: She's been super supportive of everything.
**Jared.rains**: She's been super transparent with us.
**Jared.rains**: The conversation went great.
**Jared.rains**: So I.
