## Transcript
**Bclymer**: Roof on too, and just dry fall everything up there.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah, that's.
**Jdawson**: But that we're not doing.
**Jdawson**: We're not okay painting any of the insulation.
**Jdawson**: So that's why my question was just sequencing to make sure I can get the painters in there to get all the steel painted around you guys.
**Jdawson**: Because once you, you know, you guys will be, you know, working west to east and then they can come in and start painting before you come back and start doing panels.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I mean, to me that would make sense.
**Bclymer**: That, that, that that would be the best case scenario.
**Jdawson**: How far do you get in the building erection before you start putting your panels on?
**Bclymer**: It's flexible.
**Bclymer**: It's not a requirement to do.
**Bclymer**: We can go through and set all the steel and then come back and sheet it.
**Bclymer**: So I mean, it's kind of up to you for what works best.
**Bclymer**: We can be flexible.
**Bclymer**: I mean, if they want to start painting the volleyball building or we're starting the volleyball or the restaurant.
**Nbigler**: No, you're starting southwest or.
**Nbigler**: Yeah, southwest.
**Nbigler**: Going north on the collective end and then you're going west on the volleyball to east on the volleyball.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So I mean, they could get started.
**Nbigler**: That's how Mark's got it all set up.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I mean, as soon, as soon as we get the steel up and detail, they could start painting right away.
**Bclymer**: As we move down, you know, as we, as we move.
**Bclymer**: We would just want to make sure before they start painting.
**Bclymer**: We've got every.
**Bclymer**: Make sure it's all detailed and everything's up.
**Bclymer**: Before we start.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, before they start painting.
**Jdawson**: Eli, are you determining the final painting colors?
**Jdawson**: Finished colors, right?
**Awoodhams**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so on the underside of the mezzanine we have, I believe it calls for a spray on insulation that's tinted.
**Jdawson**: Are you planning on us doing black?
**Jdawson**: Are we doing black everywhere on the other side?
**Gdesmit**: Yeah, on the underside we'll do tricorn black.
**Gdesmit**: That was our color that we used in the last space and they're happy with that.
**Jdawson**: What about all the exposed steel columns, the roof joists?
**Jdawson**: That's what we were talking about when you came on.
**Jdawson**: Trying to sequence, make sure we get that painted before the insulation goes on.
**Jdawson**: Because we're leaving the insulation white.
**Gdesmit**: Insulation's white on the ceiling and the volleyball.
**Gdesmit**: I mean, I'd prefer we do all the joists and trusses and whatnot to be black.
**Gdesmit**: That would be, that's what we did last time.
**Jdawson**: All steel will be black.
**Gdesmit**: That would be ideal.
**Awoodhams**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Hey, Glenn, correct me, did we, did we ever talk about black faced insulation in the Dining part.
**Jdawson**: We never, we never did.
**Jdawson**: We were going to leave it white.
**Jdawson**: I think they want, they wanted it brighter in there because there's not.
**Jdawson**: There's got a covered patio, so there's not a ton of sunlight that comes through.
**Jdawson**: There's no skylights or anything.
**Bclymer**: Sure, sure.
**Jdawson**: They wanted to keep it a little as bright as they could.
**Jdawson**: Which, which, back to that.
**Jdawson**: Eli, do we want to do on the bar, restaurant mezzanine roof, ceiling, do we want to do those, you know, roof truss is white or still black?
**Jdawson**: And you can, you can answer that, you think about or something.
**Gdesmit**: But yeah, I, I, we just got started on this.
**Gdesmit**: Some of these questions may just be a little ahead of where we're at.
**Gdesmit**: So I don't know how to answer that.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: All right, well, for sequencing, we're all right, then we'll.
**Jdawson**: We'll cross that bridge in the future.
**Jdawson**: Did Jeff ever jump on City would be here.
**Jdawson**: Why is he not getting this invite?
**Jdawson**: He's on.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I don't see him.
**Jdawson**: I don't see him on our.
**Jdawson**: Andrew, can you forward him the invite so he can get on here?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: He just texted me.
**Nbigler**: Yeah, his name's on it, so.
**Jdawson**: All right, never mind.
**Jdawson**: I found it.
**Jdawson**: All right, he'll jump on in a second.
**Jdawson**: In the meantime, let's get.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so I know again, you mentioned Eli, you guys kind of just got started.
**Jdawson**: So do you have anything at this point to show or to discuss based on any qu.
**Jdawson**: Any questions on layout or any stuff that we've already kind of gone through with design intent?
**Gdesmit**: Yeah, so we do have some stuff we.
**Gdesmit**: Melissa has a bunch of questions.
**Gdesmit**: As we started going through the model and plans, we just need somebody to tell us what's, what's happening in some of these areas.
**Gdesmit**: Some layout stuff was not quite working with some of our actual assets, so we are redoing some of the layout.
**Gdesmit**: It's not going to be, like, wildly different, but we're going to just tweak some things.
**Gdesmit**: But the majority of our questions are around what is happening right here?
**Gdesmit**: What is happening right there?
**Gdesmit**: What's happening under this?
**Gdesmit**: So those are the kinds of questions we have that will help us plan for moving forward.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Is there.
**Jdawson**: Jeff just got on here.
**Jdawson**: Do you have any.
**Jdawson**: You want to pull up and share your screen or something?
**Gdesmit**: Yeah, Mel can share.
**Ashton**: Can you hear me this time, by.
**Gdesmit**: The way, you're a little low.
**Ashton**: Really?
**Ashton**: I don't know your phone.
**Ashton**: I don't know what's up, but I will try to talk loud.
**Ashton**: Thank you okay, Let me share.
**Ashton**: Let me know when you can see.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Ashton**: Cool.
**Ashton**: All right, so, yeah, we had a few questions.
**Ashton**: I want to start on the second level.
**Ashton**: The furniture is just kind of like a rough plan so far, but our first main question was in these nooks area areas.
**Ashton**: I think on the life safety plan, the original intention was to have two sofas and a coffee table on the inside, but it's quite tight other than this middle one, which seems to be a little bit bigger.
**Ashton**: So I wanted to kind of talk about spacing in this area with you.
**Ashton**: Is there any way that maybe we could eat up one of these closets or have, you know, maybe four instead of five nooks and.
**Ashton**: And make them all the same size as the center one?
**Ashton**: Because, you know, we don't necessarily love the idea of having these side tables or a sofa that faces out because it's not conversational.
**Ashton**: So we don't have a whole lot of space in these areas to do what the.
**Ashton**: The original intention was, was planned.
**Ashton**: So we wanted to kind of be.
**Gdesmit**: Able to move any of these walls a little.
**Awoodhams**: Glenn.
**Awoodhams**: I think the first thing I would suggest would be to.
**Awoodhams**: We'd have to go back and look because there were some of those areas that they were using as, you know, some chase space where they were routing some MEP stuff up through them to the roof.
**Awoodhams**: So I think that'd be the first thing to look at.
**Awoodhams**: The other thing is that all of those have been adjusted so that they hide the structural columns in the back.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah, we have columns.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we're hiding columns right on the edge of all those closets.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah, because if you move one of them over, then you also then can't put furniture in it anyway because there'd be a column that at that point probably has almost a two foot depth Right.
**Awoodhams**: As the PMB column comes up through the floor.
**Gdesmit**: So, okay, these may have to be like banquettes and more built in items and not as freestanding as this because right now it's.
**Gdesmit**: It's just too tight.
**Gdesmit**: If we had a coffee table in there, I mean, I don't have very feet, but my feet would struggle to make it past.
**Gdesmit**: I'd have to be wiggling them through.
**Gdesmit**: So we'll have to figure that out.
**Ashton**: Yeah, we might be able to do like a little booth situation.
**Ashton**: We could make the back spec.
**Ashton**: Yeah, we'll.
**Gdesmit**: We'll figure like maybe a U.
**Ashton**: A U.
**Ashton**: Yeah.
**Gdesmit**: Okay.
**Ashton**: Okay.
**Gdesmit**: So there are columns in there.
**Nbigler**: Cool, cool.
**Ashton**: All right, so we won't touch the space.
**Gdesmit**: Sorry.
**Gdesmit**: Chad, what was that?
**Nbigler**: So don't we have windows in those days?
**Jdawson**: They never.
**Awoodhams**: We did not.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah, we didn't put them in because when it got turned into a one hour wall, the, the glazing would have been fire rated and everything else.
**Awoodhams**: So at the, at the current time when we discussed that it was, it was discussed to not do it.
**Ashton**: Okay.
**Nbigler**: Just making sure.
**Awoodhams**: Not that it, not that it can't happen.
**Awoodhams**: Just outlining kind of what the thought process was.
**Awoodhams**: The last time that got brought up.
**Ashton**: It would be pretty cool because I.
**Nbigler**: Thought that was the whole thing.
**Nbigler**: We wanted them to be able to.
**Nbigler**: People be able to sit there and look out and watch the volleyball.
**Jdawson**: The TV up with a live camera.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah, I don't know what the, what the pricing looked like, but I think that was the driving factor was putting in a fire rated aluminum storefront system and glazing.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I mean we brought it up multiple occasions and it hasn't.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, they never pulled the trigger wanting it.
**Ashton**: So.
**Nbigler**: Yeah, I just didn't want her.
**Nbigler**: I just didn't want Eli and his team to get too far and then be going, wait a second, you're missing something.
**Gdesmit**: No, thank you.
**Gdesmit**: I appreciate that, Chad.
**Gdesmit**: All right.
**Ashton**: Okay.
**Gdesmit**: All right, what was our next one?
**Ashton**: Next question again.
**Ashton**: This.
**Ashton**: The furniture we haven't really set in stone, but I just wanted to know like if any of these fire systems, it looks like there was one in the center of this wall, can any of those be moved slightly or are those set in stone?
**Awoodhams**: No, they're not set in stone.
**Awoodhams**: We just have to have one within every 75 foot radius.
**Awoodhams**: So if you guys need one to be moved, I'd say if you wanted to send us a markup of just a PDF of where you would prefer they get moved, if they're in conflict, then we can double check our life safety plan and make sure we don't have any gaps.
**Ashton**: Okay, that sounds good.
**Gdesmit**: That would be great.
**Gdesmit**: Thank you.
**Ashton**: Cool.
**Ashton**: All right, next question is about the bar bulkhead sort of construction.
**Ashton**: So in the Revit model that was pulled in, it looked like.
**Ashton**: And maybe it's just the way that you have to construct it.
**Ashton**: In Revit, it looked like a couple walls on the interior and exterior.
**Ashton**: So I kind of closed it off.
**Ashton**: Almost like a soffit that comes down with open on the inside.
**Ashton**: Is that how the intention is or.
**Ashton**: I kind of wanted to see if, if I understood this correctly.
**Awoodhams**: I think for most of those it was different than what the, than the previous design just because it was a different construction.
**Awoodhams**: Right.
**Awoodhams**: Those were like a metal kind of decorative piece that.
**Awoodhams**: That came down.
**Awoodhams**: Right.
**Awoodhams**: Now we have them shown just as drywall bulkheads.
**Awoodhams**: So if there's some sort of piece that is, know where the drywall wants to get cut out for a shelf, for a, you know, a cubby for something to be stored above, then that would need to be detailed out.
**Ashton**: But are you intended for them to be closed like this or.
**Awoodhams**: No, no, it was.
**Awoodhams**: It was intended for them to be open like you're showing.
**Gdesmit**: Okay, and what's above there?
**Gdesmit**: Is it just ceiling joists or.
**Gdesmit**: Or presses?
**Awoodhams**: Yeah, yeah.
**Awoodhams**: So for that one, it'd be the.
**Awoodhams**: The roof ceiling joists, and then you'd have the swagged bat insulation for the roofing system is what you would see.
**Ashton**: Okay, yeah.
**Ashton**: So down here, I see some of the actual.
**Gdesmit**: It's like that.
**Awoodhams**: Yes, it would look similar to that.
**Awoodhams**: The.
**Awoodhams**: The structure on the.
**Awoodhams**: On the roof is a little bit different than the mezzanine framing, but.
**Gdesmit**: Okay.
**Ashton**: Yeah, we just exported this straight from Revit, so.
**Awoodhams**: Yep.
**Awoodhams**: If you pull in.
**Awoodhams**: If you pull in the ifc, the.
**Awoodhams**: There was two different Revit models.
**Awoodhams**: The IFC has all the structure.
**Awoodhams**: That would probably be pretty important because then it would show you kind of where you might have conflicts from a furniture, because the.
**Awoodhams**: The col, specifically from the BMB are not small, so.
**Ashton**: Okay.
**Ashton**: Okay.
**Awoodhams**: We put in ones.
**Awoodhams**: So the PEMB does not have some of the mezzanine framing.
**Awoodhams**: So like any of the steel beams you see at the bottom of the mezzanine and some columns that don't go from finished floor to the roof, those are not included in the PEMB model.
**Awoodhams**: So we put them in ourself based on the sizes given to us, just so for reference, so we knew where stuff was.
**Ashton**: Understand?
**Ashton**: Okay, yeah, we'll pull that in and make sure we're not missing anything.
**Awoodhams**: Gotcha.
**Ashton**: Okay, so actually, while we're on the main level bar, I did have a question.
**Ashton**: And I don't know if this is just maybe the way that I pulled it in from Revit, but as you can see here, this bottom structure, this bar was actually off center between these beams.
**Ashton**: And I just want to make sure.
**Ashton**: I think in the drawings, the autocad drawings, it looked like it was.
**Ashton**: Was centered in this space and on this window between these garage doors.
**Ashton**: I.
**Ashton**: I centered it in here, but it wasn't originally.
**Ashton**: It was.
**Ashton**: What was this?
**Ashton**: One foot, five off.
**Jdawson**: Oops.
**Ashton**: Yeah, one foot five off.
**Ashton**: So I just want to make sure that the intention is for it to all be centered Within.
**Ashton**: Oops, sorry.
**Ashton**: Within the garage door.
**Awoodhams**: Let me see.
**Ashton**: Yeah.
**Gdesmit**: Yeah.
**Awoodhams**: We did not have it centered, but there's no reason that it can't be.
**Awoodhams**: I think that area got moved around quite a bit.
**Awoodhams**: I think it had to do something with making sure there was enough clearance on one side.
**Awoodhams**: I think it was because the counter would have.
**Awoodhams**: The way that it was spaced, from a dimension standpoint, it would have hit at the column.
**Awoodhams**: So when you get the IFC model in, you may want to double check that.
**Awoodhams**: On one side, it was pulled away from the wall as a pass through for staff, and on the other side, it was.
**Awoodhams**: It went past the column, so it cleared it so that you didn't have to notch the counter around a column.
**Awoodhams**: That was.
**Jdawson**: I see.
**Ashton**: Okay, then.
**Ashton**: Yeah, we'll pull that in.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah, yeah.
**Awoodhams**: So that you.
**Awoodhams**: That may.
**Awoodhams**: You may change your mind once you see that, get the structure in.
**Awoodhams**: But I don't see that there's no reason why it can't be moved.
**Ashton**: Okay, sounds good.
**Ashton**: All right, let me take a look at the next.
**Gdesmit**: Mel.
**Gdesmit**: If you go back up to the bar that we were looking at first, there's that long thing.
**Gdesmit**: Let's figure out what that is.
**Ashton**: Yeah, it looks like there was some piece of either equipment or like a little island in here.
**Ashton**: I wanted to check out what this is intended to be.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah, I think in our model, that was hidden.
**Awoodhams**: I don't know what it was originally, but, yeah, I think that's just an artifact that's left over.
**Awoodhams**: It was hidden on our sheets.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah.
**Gdesmit**: We were like, what is this weirdness?
**Gdesmit**: Who put this stuff.
**Ashton**: I see it different here.
**Ashton**: Yeah.
**Ashton**: Okay.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah.
**Ashton**: All right, cool.
**Ashton**: Go on.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah.
**Awoodhams**: Once you bring in the full Revit model, anything that was, like, hidden in view all of a sudden comes back to haunt you, and we forgot it was there.
**Ashton**: Okay, sounds good.
**Ashton**: And we'll build out the island similar to how it is in the CAD file.
**Ashton**: Awesome.
**Ashton**: All right, next.
**Gdesmit**: Oh, mezzanine railing.
**Ashton**: Yeah, about the mezzanine.
**Ashton**: So again, wasn't sure if the intention was to have this handrail go all the way around the mezzanine.
**Ashton**: It kind of sticks out a little bit far for some of our furniture, so wanted to see if that was actually the intention or just the way that it came in from Revit.
**Awoodhams**: Let me look at our section or.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Are you asking about that handrail specifically, not the overall rail?
**Gdesmit**: Correct.
**Jdawson**: Do that.
**Jdawson**: However, at this point, I think so.
**Jdawson**: Go back to where you were at the top of the stairs.
**Ashton**: Sure.
**Jdawson**: So on either side of the Stairs.
**Jdawson**: We're going to put a bar top there for standing.
**Jdawson**: Like a standing bar top.
**Ashton**: Oh, okay.
**Gdesmit**: Okay.
**Gdesmit**: So we can get rid of this.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah, yeah.
**Awoodhams**: So what I'm, I'm looking at in our model, the stair detail that we have on a 123 does not include the rail.
**Awoodhams**: So it would just need to come up past the stair and have a, you know, the, the required extension, but we don't need it on the 42 inch guardrail.
**Awoodhams**: Okay.
**Ashton**: Okay.
**Ashton**: Understand then.
**Ashton**: Do you have a detail of this, the standing bar that you were talking about?
**Jdawson**: I don't.
**Jdawson**: That'll be.
**Jdawson**: I just.
**Jdawson**: I just let the steel guys know who are making the rails and stairs that delegated design into.
**Ashton**: That's the intent to this.
**Jdawson**: It can be.
**Jdawson**: I don't.
**Jdawson**: I don't have any dimensions for it.
**Jdawson**: I don't.
**Jdawson**: I don't know if it needs to be 12, 18 inches.
**Jdawson**: I don't know.
**Jdawson**: I don't know what, what it needs to be.
**Jdawson**: You guys can let me know.
**Jdawson**: I mean, what.
**Jdawson**: What did you guys do at Liberty?
**Jdawson**: How.
**Jdawson**: How deep is that?
**Awoodhams**: It's.
**Jdawson**: And it's going to be mounted.
**Jdawson**: It's not going to be a table with a leg.
**Jdawson**: So it'll.
**Jdawson**: It'll just be mounted to the, to the stand.
**Gdesmit**: Yeah.
**Gdesmit**: Because we had to do a.
**Gdesmit**: A steel system or a rail system that was like prefab, so.
**Gdesmit**: Or semi custom.
**Gdesmit**: So that's why we had to build something.
**Gdesmit**: So.
**Gdesmit**: That's good to know.
**Gdesmit**: It's all integrated.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah.
**Awoodhams**: And the other thing, too, it's.
**Awoodhams**: Again.
**Awoodhams**: Right.
**Awoodhams**: It's the discrepancy between how we actually detail it out and how it's.
**Awoodhams**: How it comes in and rapid.
**Awoodhams**: Sometimes if you look on drawing five on a 123, the railing, that's how it's shown here.
**Awoodhams**: Because we didn't.
**Awoodhams**: We had the mezzanine steel stuff is not in the model for like the edge angles and that sort of stuff.
**Awoodhams**: So these railings will actually be welded to the face of the hedge angle.
**Awoodhams**: So drawing five on a 123 has that specific detail of what that railing will look like.
**Awoodhams**: If you want to reference that just for your own.
**Nbigler**: Cool.
**Gdesmit**: Yeah, I made a note for that.
**Gdesmit**: Thank you.
**Ashton**: Yep, sounds good.
**Ashton**: Thanks.
**Ashton**: Okay.
**Gdesmit**: Fireplace.
**Ashton**: See.
**Ashton**: Yeah.
**Ashton**: Thank you.
**Ashton**: Thank you, Eli.
**Ashton**: I'm on it at the notes on my phone.
**Ashton**: Okay.
**Ashton**: All right.
**Ashton**: So in Liberty Collective, we had a fireplace in this sort of like, living room that we called it, with a large tv.
**Ashton**: And so we wanted to see if there was any sort of Intention for a fireplace or maybe like a sort of bump out detail for the tv.
**Ashton**: Any sort of feature on this wall or if this was intended to just be flat with furniture facing a tv.
**Gdesmit**: Nobody knows that.
**Gdesmit**: We could do it.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah, yeah.
**Awoodhams**: I mean again, I think if that's something that we want to add in, I don't think it's a big deal.
**Awoodhams**: I think we would just need to figure out if we need, if it's something that you guys do because it's more of like a furniture kind of pre built things.
**Awoodhams**: If we need to do a, a small ASI to show some, some you know, furred out walls in that area, just let us know.
**Ashton**: Okay.
**Gdesmit**: Yeah, we did an electric fireplace over at Liberty to avoid any like, like, you know, ventilation, H vac, gas, whatnot.
**Gdesmit**: So we just did an electric.
**Gdesmit**: It's more, more of a vibe.
**Gdesmit**: So we'll, we'll probably want to do something like that here because that was a big feature.
**Jdawson**: Where is, where are we looking?
**Jdawson**: Is this the north wall and second floor?
**Ashton**: This is when you first walk.
**Jdawson**: Oh, okay.
**Jdawson**: There we go.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Awoodhams**: Glenn.
**Awoodhams**: I guess the only other thing we'd want to be sure of is any electrical requirements would need to be picked up by deem or I'm sorry, not deemed by.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, deem is electrical.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah, yeah, sorry.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah.
**Awoodhams**: Theme.
**Jdawson**: So what's, what's in between?
**Jdawson**: That's the awning.
**Jdawson**: So if we, if we put an electrical on there is.
**Jdawson**: Is that, does that need like a chase or a stack outside the wall we can build it in?
**Gdesmit**: No, because it's, it's electric.
**Gdesmit**: It's just, it's a heated with.
**Gdesmit**: It's a heated unit with a blower on it.
**Gdesmit**: You know, you don't even have to turn the heat on.
**Jdawson**: Does it still have a, do we still have a chase or some kind of stack?
**Gdesmit**: Yeah, there's no heat.
**Jdawson**: It's.
**Gdesmit**: It's electric.
**Awoodhams**: It's.
**Awoodhams**: It's just radiant.
**Gdesmit**: There's no, there's no heat.
**Gdesmit**: Yeah, it's radiant.
**Gdesmit**: Thank you.
**Gdesmit**: It's a vibe.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah, yeah.
**Awoodhams**: I'm looking at the electrical drawings.
**Awoodhams**: There is an outlet.
**Awoodhams**: So if it uses a standard outlet, then it's probably a one time move it.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah.
**Awoodhams**: Okay, so if it's a 110, the outlet that's there is.
**Awoodhams**: It's not in that center bay.
**Awoodhams**: It's just to the outside of column line 11.5.
**Awoodhams**: So that may just be something where we would need to coordinate, you know, wherever that it ends up that the outlet that's along that wall just gets moved so that it's behind the unit.
**Gdesmit**: Okay, great.
**Gdesmit**: Thank you.
**Ashton**: Sounds good.
**Ashton**: Cool.
**Gdesmit**: We can provide claiming details for that as well if we do it.
**Ashton**: Yeah.
**Ashton**: Does it need venting out the roof then?
**Gdesmit**: No, that's what we were saying.
**Gdesmit**: It shouldn't need any vent.
**Gdesmit**: It pulls air in and just recycles it out.
**Ashton**: Got it, got it.
**Ashton**: Okay.
**Gdesmit**: Out the front, you don't even have to turn the heat on, you know, we probably never will.
**Ashton**: Okay.
**Awoodhams**: We've been.
**Awoodhams**: We've been using the water vapor fireplaces.
**Gdesmit**: Those are sick.
**Jdawson**: Those are so cool.
**Awoodhams**: Because otherwise people put their hand in them and burn themselves.
**Gdesmit**: We'll see them, right?
**Awoodhams**: Yeah.
**Ashton**: Cool.
**Ashton**: All right, well, while we're near the stairs, question.
**Ashton**: Are the stairs going to be enclosed?
**Ashton**: I kind of just built this wall behind the host stand, but I wanted to see if the stairs are intended to be open underneath or if they're going to be closed by a wall.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah, the intention right now is that they're open.
**Ashton**: Okay, sounds good.
**Ashton**: Then we'll work the furniture around it.
**Ashton**: Because this is a little awkward having it kind of.
**Awoodhams**: I mean there's again, there's no reason that it can't be closed if.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah, if that needs to be based on how you guys are designing the casework.
**Gdesmit**: Yeah.
**Ashton**: Might make things a little bit easier for us.
**Ashton**: Especially when you walk in having the host area a little bit separated.
**Ashton**: Yeah, but.
**Awoodhams**: And maybe it's just where those columns are.
**Awoodhams**: It just enclosing from there because that's essentially the seven foot line.
**Awoodhams**: So.
**Ashton**: I see.
**Ashton**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Hand to the right a little bit, I think.
**Jdawson**: Are you missing those other columns that we had to add?
**Jdawson**: Probably, yes.
**Jdawson**: Can you look at that desk from the.
**Jdawson**: From coming in from the front door?
**Gdesmit**: Yeah, yeah.
**Awoodhams**: And again, Glenn, I think that might be because those are in the IFC model.
**Awoodhams**: I'd have to double check.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, but that messes up their layout.
**Jdawson**: How they have it right here.
**Jdawson**: I think I asked you, Eli, you had like a 12 and a half foot desk or 12 foot five toast stand desk at Liberty.
**Gdesmit**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Or maybe I scaled it or something.
**Jdawson**: We put columns right there.
**Ashton**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: On either end of the stairs.
**Jdawson**: What do we.
**Jdawson**: I think we went with 10ft on center.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Awoodhams**: I mean they're just aligned with the other ones that are in there.
**Jdawson**: No, they're not.
**Jdawson**: Remember two stairs?
**Jdawson**: Remember?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Didn't we did a ten foot on center.
**Awoodhams**: You'd have to go look at the.
**Ashton**: Okay.
**Gdesmit**: Yeah, we'll do that.
**Jdawson**: So those are four inch columns.
**Jdawson**: So you'll have nine foot.
**Jdawson**: What is eight.
**Jdawson**: Nine foot, eight inside the inside column.
**Jdawson**: Right, right there at the bottom.
**Jdawson**: Like right directly under the mezzanine.
**Ashton**: So I don't think it's a huge issue if we shrink the host area.
**Gdesmit**: Yeah, yeah, I'm not worried about that.
**Ashton**: Okay.
**Gdesmit**: Okay.
**Ashton**: Yep.
**Ashton**: We'll make sure that that's in there.
**Ashton**: Awesome.
**Gdesmit**: Next up, is there a beer wall in here?
**Gdesmit**: Because Mike loves a beer wall.
**Jdawson**: Go to the north wall, first floor, just outside that rest those restaurants.
**Awoodhams**: Nope, it's where you have that banquet right now.
**Awoodhams**: So right there, that's the beer wall.
**Ashton**: Got it.
**Ashton**: Okay, sounds good.
**Ashton**: We'll make that.
**Ashton**: I wanted to ask because there was nothing in the life safety plan in this area.
**Ashton**: What is intended to go over here is that just more seating now?
**Awoodhams**: That's the game room.
**Awoodhams**: So I don't know what Mike's intent was for.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah, so that was just kind of blank on.
**Awoodhams**: On.
**Awoodhams**: On our end.
**Awoodhams**: We have it included as part of the assembly occupancy.
**Awoodhams**: But yeah, there.
**Awoodhams**: There was no seating there because that was where all the gaming equipment was.
**Awoodhams**: Was indicated.
**Ashton**: Okay, sounds good.
**Ashton**: We'll talk to Mike about that.
**Awoodhams**: I'll see you later.
**Gdesmit**: All right, next are TVs.
**Gdesmit**: Is this something you want us detailing where.
**Gdesmit**: With Mike, where he wants all of his TVs.
**Gdesmit**: Big TV guy.
**Awoodhams**: Good man.
**Jdawson**: I know that on the second.
**Jdawson**: On the second floor right there is.
**Jdawson**: What do you call it?
**Jdawson**: An LED wall.
**Gdesmit**: Okay.
**Gdesmit**: So that's.
**Gdesmit**: This is one thing we were asking.
**Gdesmit**: Where is the LED wall?
**Jdawson**: That's one.
**Jdawson**: That's something I was asking because those storefronts are pretty tall to fit.
**Jdawson**: I.
**Jdawson**: I can't remember a size that he said.
**Jdawson**: Jeff, do you remember a size that he was thinking, like 200 inches?
**Awoodhams**: Yeah, because we were kind of.
**Awoodhams**: We were not involved in any of the, like, FF&E equipment stuff, so I.
**Awoodhams**: I have no idea.
**Awoodhams**: I.
**Awoodhams**: But I think to your question, Eli.
**Awoodhams**: Yes, I would work with Mike to figure out where he wants TVs.
**Awoodhams**: And then we'll just have to have Dean update electrical accordingly.
**Ashton**: Okay.
**Ashton**: Yeah.
**Ashton**: In Liberty, it was almost like this wall opposite the stairs extended up.
**Ashton**: And this was a whole large TV wall.
**Ashton**: So we're just checking to see if that was.
**Ashton**: Yeah.
**Ashton**: If that was her.
**Ashton**: His plan still.
**Ashton**: But.
**Ashton**: Okay, we'll.
**Ashton**: We'll talk to Mike.
**Gdesmit**: All right.
**Gdesmit**: And then.
**Gdesmit**: Oh, all right.
**Gdesmit**: Yeah, we got that.
**Gdesmit**: All right, so I think we're.
**Gdesmit**: That's all of our questions, Melissa.
**Ashton**: Cool.
**Ashton**: Yeah, we'll pull in the IFC model and make sure that we've got all those structural beams and everything.
**Ashton**: Correct.
**Ashton**: And then kind of work around that, so.
**Ashton**: Oh, actually, I did have a question.
**Ashton**: So the flooring, the main level flooring is all polished concrete.
**Ashton**: Is that correct?
**Awoodhams**: Sealed, Sealed, Sealed.
**Nbigler**: Okay, sealed.
**Ashton**: And then upstairs, are we.
**Ashton**: Can we add flooring here or is it the same?
**Jdawson**: Same.
**Jdawson**: There will be no flooring in this place at all.
**Nbigler**: Blend bathrooms.
**Nbigler**: And elevator.
**Nbigler**: And elevator.
**Jdawson**: I'm sorry, the elevator will.
**Jdawson**: The bathroom.
**Nbigler**: Bathrooms.
**Jdawson**: Where do you see?
**Jdawson**: Nothing's in the bathrooms.
**Jdawson**: No, no, no, no, no.
**Jdawson**: Just, just the wet wall and the base trim of the, of the bathrooms.
**Jdawson**: Everything, everything is sealed concrete.
**Ashton**: Got it.
**Jdawson**: If they want flooring at this point, that would be added.
**Jdawson**: But we've, we've gone through it and that's what we left this.
**Jdawson**: That's what we went with.
**Ashton**: Okay.
**Ashton**: Understand.
**Ashton**: All right, cool.
**Ashton**: That was all our questions so far.
**Ashton**: I think we'll continue to cruise and let you guys know where we are.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, it's good.
**Ashton**: All right, cool.
**Ashton**: Yeah, I was gonna say.
**Ashton**: Anything in the volleyball area?
**Gdesmit**: No, we're gonna have to talk to Katie about that.
**Ashton**: Okay.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah, sounds good.
**Gdesmit**: Separate.
**Ashton**: Cool.
**Gdesmit**: All right.
**Jdawson**: Right on.
**Gdesmit**: That's all we got for today.
**Gdesmit**: Just a lot of questions.
**Jdawson**: Awesome.
**Ashton**: Thank you.
**Gdesmit**: Does anyone have anything for us in the meantime?
**Jdawson**: I'm just getting my agenda back up here.
**Jdawson**: Let's see.
**Jdawson**: See what else we had to hit up today.
**Jdawson**: Order pizza on your guys's website.
**Gdesmit**: You like that?
**Nbigler**: Tricked me.
**Gdesmit**: That's the point.
**Awoodhams**: I was excited.
**Nbigler**: Got him.
**Ashton**: Well, we did do a pizza place that just closed, so otherwise we could have redirected you.
**Ashton**: So.
**Jdawson**: Jeff, is there going to be any implications in your model?
**Jdawson**: I guess since we're changing the elevator shaft size.
**Awoodhams**: No, because it's all interior.
**Awoodhams**: They would never see that wall anyway.
**Awoodhams**: So we didn't move any of the outer facing walls that face the main space.
**Ashton**: Great.
**Jdawson**: I thought your.
**Jdawson**: I thought your pit was narrower.
**Awoodhams**: Well, I'm talking about just from an interior standpoint.
**Awoodhams**: An interior standpoint.
**Awoodhams**: Right.
**Awoodhams**: That.
**Awoodhams**: That doesn't affect Eli and his team.
**Jdawson**: Okay, got it.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I was just thinking if this wall pushed out, but.
**Jdawson**: No good.
**Awoodhams**: Yep.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah, it's all enclosed by that Chase, so.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Pemb.
**Jdawson**: Hey, Pemb.
**Jdawson**: So Brandt is here for that.
**Jdawson**: I think I talked to Nick and let him know, but we had to switch four of the door heights.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I think I remember hearing something about that.
**Bclymer**: That may be something we have to just change in the field.
**Jdawson**: That's.
**Jdawson**: That's what he said.
**Jdawson**: But I just want to make sure that Nick's been gone for two weeks, so I don't know if he was even here when we made that final decision.
**Jdawson**: I can't even remember at this point.
**Jdawson**: But, yeah, I think that was happening.
**Bclymer**: Right before he left.
**Bclymer**: So he'll get.
**Bclymer**: He's back on Monday, so I'll.
**Bclymer**: I'll refresh him.
**Jdawson**: Cool.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: And then is Demon here?
**Jdawson**: No.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: With Nick to Brand, we had some change orders that were going to be coming.
**Jdawson**: We got you guys under contract so we can get the building order and down payment and stuff, but we hadn't had a handful of items kind of finalized.
**Jdawson**: And one.
**Jdawson**: I know it's a slab edge angle that we had to choose a size and all that stuff.
**Bclymer**: Correct.
**Jdawson**: There's a couple more things I just wanted to.
**Jdawson**: Now that we're getting this far, let's get that wrapped up.
**Awoodhams**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: Next week.
**Jdawson**: We can review it, I guess when Nick's back, which I know he has a list of things that are going on.
**Jdawson**: I can't remember all the items.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, he's been trying to keep track of it and keep it organized, and so.
**Bclymer**: I know.
**Bclymer**: I know the mezzanine angle was one of those.
**Bclymer**: And then I sent over the pricing for the rooftop screens to Andrew, so.
**Awoodhams**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, those are expensive.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, they are shockingly expensive.
**Jdawson**: We got it.
**Jdawson**: We got another estimate not far off of you guys for just the material, not even the labor to put them in.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: What.
**Jdawson**: What, the ones you sent to Andrew, was that to mount to the curb or mount to the unit themselves that was.
**Bclymer**: That was mounting to the curb.
**Jdawson**: Is there a weight limit that we need to stay under as we're reviewing options for these screens?
**Jdawson**: Nick had mentioned something about, like, an extra £500 or less is.
**Jdawson**: No, there's no deal.
**Bclymer**: Typically that would be the.
**Nbigler**: The limit.
**Jdawson**: Correct.
**Bclymer**: I can find out for sure, but typically that would be the limit.
**Jdawson**: Well, our next.
**Jdawson**: Our next.
**Jdawson**: Our.
**Jdawson**: We're currently looking with the H vac contractor, too, because these are RTUs.
**Jdawson**: If they have mounting brackets or able to come with mounting brackets to mount screens directly on them, then they may be able to just bring that as a unit.
**Jdawson**: So we're.
**Jdawson**: We're trying to look into all the options.
**Jdawson**: We had to figure out what the city wanted us to do first.
**Jdawson**: And they said we can do individual screens.
**Jdawson**: You don't have to, like, do a big, square fenced off area.
**Bclymer**: Sure, sure.
**Gdesmit**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Just.
**Bclymer**: Just let me know what you want to do there.
**Jdawson**: I don't.
**Bclymer**: I don't think the lead time is.
**Bclymer**: Is an issue at this point.
**Bclymer**: So, you know, let us know whenever.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: Anybody else need any other answers, have any other questions?
**Jdawson**: I'll send out the minutes here, all the notes that we just took for all your questions.
**Jdawson**: I know I noted in here.
**Gdesmit**: Oh, thank you.
**Ashton**: Thank you.
**Gdesmit**: I was doing that.
**Gdesmit**: All right.
**Jdawson**: I don't know.
**Jdawson**: I think I got them all.
**Jdawson**: So between mine, and you guys should be able to capture them.
**Gdesmit**: You appreciate it.
**Bclymer**: Sounds good.
**Gdesmit**: All right.
**Jdawson**: We will check in next Thursday and see how we're looking.
**Bclymer**: See you.
**Jdawson**: Bye.
**Jdawson**: And.
