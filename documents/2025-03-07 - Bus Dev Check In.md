**Speaker 1**: Oh, I'm hanging in there.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: It's Friday.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Was it yesterday?
**Speaker 1**: You were here Wednesday?
**Speaker 1**: I was in.
**Speaker 1**: I was on it.
**Speaker 1**: I was in Dallas on a project, so I've been having to travel there.
**Speaker 1**: We're doing.
**Speaker 1**: We did the one up here.
**Speaker 1**: Ulta Beauty Warehouse.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, gotcha.
**Speaker 1**: So it's.
**Speaker 1**: It's an existing warehouse, but it's, you know, pretty big retrofit project.
**Speaker 1**: We call them.
**Speaker 1**: It.
**Speaker 1**: We call it an infrastructure project, but racking and pick modules and automatic robotic sorting systems, etc.
**Speaker 1**: Got you.
**Bclymer**: The phone.
**Bclymer**: Are you still on the phone?
**Speaker 1**: You guys had.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: The total fee that you guys have unmuted.
**Bclymer**: Who you talking to?
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, 70.
**Speaker 1**: Yes, 72, 000, I think you.
**Speaker 1**: You guys were coming in at like, I forget.
**Speaker 1**: It was.
**Speaker 1**: It was 70.
**Speaker 1**: And we paid you that.
**Speaker 1**: And we've paid you that full 72,000, correct?
**Speaker 1**: No, like, now.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, gosh, jeez.
**Speaker 1**: Was not paid.
**Speaker 1**: Let me.
**Speaker 1**: Let me get with accounting, Jeff, and I'll figure out where at least the remainder of that check is, because you guys should not be waiting that long.
**Speaker 1**: And I've been trying to get them to do final payout.
**Speaker 1**: So I.
**Speaker 1**: It may be today, but let me follow up with you here.
**Speaker 1**: I'm actually getting ready to step into a meeting.
**Speaker 1**: Give me till like 2:00 today.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, I apologize.
**Speaker 1**: I didn't know you guys hadn't received that amount yet.
**Speaker 1**: So that's.
**Speaker 1**: That's on me.
**Speaker 1**: So.
**Speaker 1**: All right.
**Speaker 1**: All right, thank you, Jeff.
**Speaker 1**: I thought we cut Studio X as a check for what?
**Speaker 1**: So our.
**Speaker 1**: Our purchase order amount was.
**Speaker 1**: We've talked about this before for crate was 72,000.
**Speaker 1**: And Jeff's like, well, that structural was just an estimate.
**Speaker 1**: It was really, you know, 20 grand.
**Speaker 1**: And so he's trying to get seven more grand out of me.
**Speaker 1**: And I was like, dude, like, we're using you on collective.
**Speaker 1**: Like, take a hike.
**Speaker 1**: You can't just three months later tell me it's seven grand more.
**Speaker 1**: But I guess we haven't paid them the full amount, which is weird because I know.
**Speaker 1**: I mean, I.
**Speaker 1**: I've had.
**Speaker 1**: I've asked accounting a couple times to cut their full amount.
**Speaker 1**: So I'll follow up with them and.
**Bclymer**: See and I'll look it up.
**Bclymer**: Real.
**Speaker 1**: I didn't want you to hear.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I mean, we paid them 10, 5, 21, 687.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So we should.
**Speaker 1**: We should have paid them 72, 000 total.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, he's right on that.
**Speaker 1**: And so I'll go back and look, and maybe it's.
**Speaker 1**: It's my fault, but I, I know.
**Speaker 1**: I mean.
**Bclymer**: So it paid him 23.
**Bclymer**: 750 on check.
**Bclymer**: 756.
**Bclymer**: 35,000 on check 837.
**Bclymer**: That's 58.
**Bclymer**: And then we paid them 687 and then 31 5, which I believe this is for.
**Speaker 1**: Collective.
**Bclymer**: Collective.
**Speaker 1**: I'll get with accounting.
**Speaker 1**: You don't need to worry about it.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, they're missing payment.
**Bclymer**: So find out where the that's at.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I'm open on job planner.
**Speaker 1**: These purchase we're able to bill against purchase orders.
**Speaker 1**: It's been a mess.
**Speaker 1**: How's the weather down there?
**Bclymer**: It's good.
**Bclymer**: It's good.
**Speaker 1**: You had an early flight this morning.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I did.
**Speaker 1**: You caught me right when I was doing my P90X yoga.
**Bclymer**: So what you got?
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, a lot.
**Speaker 1**: Share my screen, you'll be able to see all this too.
**Speaker 1**: So I, I made my list.
**Speaker 1**: I've been just doing research since we last talked and I, I put it all in edge, I put it all in pipe drive and I made a new label as like a target company.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Mm.
**Speaker 1**: And I have, I have a lot.
**Speaker 1**: I was, I was, I was researching companies.
**Speaker 1**: Obviously they can't have their own construction arm.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Speaker 1**: And I was looking for more small to medium sized developers.
**Speaker 1**: The only way of getting that is just either it's chat, GBT or LinkedIn or, or just knowing the guys in the area, some that I already wanted that were on my list and I just haven't gone after them.
**Bclymer**: So is there a way like to have a column to the right that has like a link to their website?
**Speaker 1**: I.
**Speaker 1**: I can do that.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So what's.
**Bclymer**: So let's start here.
**Speaker 1**: So like, well, I came up with like.
**Bclymer**: Why are you clicking all these?
**Speaker 1**: Because I think I can like bulk edit them.
**Speaker 1**: But each one of these is like a good one to know.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I came up with 41 of them.
**Speaker 1**: And then anyway, these are, these are Tampa Bay area and Indianapolis area guys.
**Speaker 1**: But do you want to just go through each one?
**Bclymer**: What's.
**Bclymer**: So like let's, let's look at some of these here.
**Bclymer**: So like, you know what's BWI llc?
**Speaker 1**: BWI LLC is a small developer.
**Speaker 1**: Say that again.
**Bclymer**: Experience in development and construction services.
**Bclymer**: BWI's construction, real estate development, property management and consulting firm Greater Neapolis that focuses on not only construction management, but of general large projects, but also niche energy efficient urban revitalization projects.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, so I saw their name when I was looking up, like, niche developers in the area.
**Speaker 1**: I don't know much about them.
**Speaker 1**: So what I have to do with this list, like, I dove into probably half of them, and I started inputting, like, contact names, like, who.
**Speaker 1**: Who the guy is.
**Speaker 1**: I think that makes the decisions.
**Speaker 1**: But I guess what.
**Speaker 1**: What do you think the next steps is with all these?
**Speaker 1**: Putting a website in there, Because I can do that.
**Speaker 1**: So the first thing.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, the first thing I would say to do is, so go back to your list.
**Bclymer**: So the first thing I would do is be, all right, so who is my.
**Bclymer**: Like.
**Bclymer**: Like, I need to actually come up with my top 24.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: You know, or my.
**Bclymer**: My.
**Bclymer**: Who are the actual, like, top guys?
**Bclymer**: Okay, so, like, you know, if you look at, like, so, like, Pittman Partners, is that a development?
**Bclymer**: Like.
**Speaker 1**: So I was gonna put a.
**Speaker 1**: A label on here, so I made sure that the 41 I put in there, Brandon, these are all, like, guys I want to go after.
**Speaker 1**: So I didn't.
**Speaker 1**: If they're not on that list, then they're not a target, I guess, is the right.
**Speaker 1**: Is the right word.
**Speaker 1**: So.
**Speaker 1**: So there you said 24.
**Speaker 1**: I can give you my top 24 if that's what you like.
**Bclymer**: No, I mean, I'm just like.
**Bclymer**: So, like, I'm just saying what I would.
**Bclymer**: I mean, this.
**Bclymer**: It can be top, whatever, But I would say, like, you know, like, all right, so who's actually, like, you know, priority list, right?
**Bclymer**: Like, who's.
**Bclymer**: Who's a.
**Bclymer**: Who's a big priority?
**Bclymer**: Like, if there was.
**Bclymer**: There's one company on here, you know, who would that be that I could get?
**Bclymer**: Right?
**Bclymer**: And what are your parameters for that?
**Bclymer**: Okay, well, who's doing a lot of building, right?
**Bclymer**: So who's consistently putting stuff out of the ground, you know, and then who is, you know, somebody that.
**Bclymer**: And then it's like, how can I get connected to them?
**Bclymer**: Right?
**Bclymer**: Who can I get connected to?
**Bclymer**: So, like, you know, some of these, like, okay, you've got Kittles and New City Development.
**Bclymer**: You know, I don't know any.
**Bclymer**: Any of these companies.
**Bclymer**: But.
**Bclymer**: So, like, the next task, I would say if all of these are vetted and they're like, yes, these guys are all building.
**Bclymer**: Minimum of one building a year, right?
**Bclymer**: That should be.
**Bclymer**: That should be your.
**Bclymer**: Your bottom metric.
**Bclymer**: So then it's like, okay, so the next thing I would do now that you got.
**Bclymer**: These are all the companies, right?
**Bclymer**: So I would go through and I would figure out who the person is or people at the company, right?
**Bclymer**: Boom, boom, boom.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And then Also, is there any.
**Bclymer**: Do I have anybody that's connected to them?
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: But the first step would be going through and figuring out who the decision makers are.
**Bclymer**: Boom, boom, boom.
**Bclymer**: Am I connected?
**Bclymer**: And then, you know, the reason I say, like, the priority list is like, all right, the.
**Bclymer**: The.
**Bclymer**: You know, the biggest thing with connecting these people when you don't have a relationship with them, which you don't have a relationship with any of these guys, is you have to find inventive ways to reach out to them that appeal to them as a person and what they want and like.
**Bclymer**: And need.
**Bclymer**: Right?
**Bclymer**: Because at the end of the day, like, you know, Scannel doesn't have any shortage of.
**Bclymer**: Of qualified builders that are trying to do stuff for them.
**Bclymer**: There's no shortage of that.
**Bclymer**: So how can I stand out?
**Bclymer**: Okay, well, like, if I can figure out what this person likes and loves and.
**Bclymer**: And find a.
**Bclymer**: A unique way to get that introduction to have, you know, that.
**Bclymer**: That time, that conversation with them, then your.
**Bclymer**: Your hit percentage is gonna go way through the roof because you're taking the time to do the upfront homework because you, you know, people do deals off the person, right?
**Bclymer**: You learn the person, and that's going to make the biggest difference in landing that deal versus if you're just, like, coming in as anybody else and being like, oh, yeah, well, we're.
**Bclymer**: We're low.
**Bclymer**: We'll give you a low number.
**Bclymer**: It's like, no, like.
**Bclymer**: Like, I spend this much time getting to know you as a person, and that's only gonna grow.
**Bclymer**: Nobody does that.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, no, I know.
**Speaker 1**: I.
**Speaker 1**: I know what the next steps are.
**Speaker 1**: I just.
**Speaker 1**: I need to spend this weekend and do that.
**Speaker 1**: And then I think that if I focus on.
**Bclymer**: I mean, you've got 66 leads in here, like, which is great, but that's also.
**Speaker 1**: These are old.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: These are.
**Speaker 1**: These are ones that, like, I have edited in the last three days.
**Speaker 1**: I've put these guys in here.
**Bclymer**: Okay?
**Speaker 1**: So, like.
**Speaker 1**: So, like, Pittman Partners.
**Speaker 1**: This is going to be a hot one, because I know Molly Pittman.
**Speaker 1**: I know his son Sam Pittman, and I.
**Speaker 1**: I went to a wedding, and Mr.
**Speaker 1**: Pittman was actually there.
**Speaker 1**: So that's.
**Speaker 1**: That's something where I can be like, let me get a meeting, Mr.
**Speaker 1**: Pittman.
**Speaker 1**: I don't know Mr.
**Speaker 1**: Pitt.
**Speaker 1**: I don't.
**Speaker 1**: I remember his first name, but I can figure out a way to.
**Speaker 1**: To find out what he.
**Speaker 1**: What he's into.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And it's.
**Bclymer**: So, like, I would put this.
**Bclymer**: Let me get a meeting, Mr.
**Bclymer**: Mr.
**Bclymer**: Pittman.
**Bclymer**: Like, yeah, it's understanding what does this guy like, what makes him tick and all that.
**Bclymer**: And you also have to understand maybe Mr.
**Bclymer**: Pittman isn't the guy.
**Bclymer**: You know, maybe somebody else is the guy.
**Bclymer**: That's where you've got to find out about the company.
**Bclymer**: Who's the actual person?
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So I would say they're a hot one.
**Speaker 1**: I would say Kenmar is a hot one.
**Speaker 1**: But this relationship was.
**Speaker 1**: Needs to be amended from Doug.
**Bclymer**: What do you mean?
**Speaker 1**: Jason Miller Obalis.
**Bclymer**: He works for Kinmar.
**Speaker 1**: He's part.
**Speaker 1**: He's kind of a partner.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Kind of a partner or what?
**Speaker 1**: Kidmar and Ovalis share an office.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So he owns the company.
**Speaker 1**: I believe he has interest in it, yes.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Is there anybody else who owns the company?
**Speaker 1**: I know there is.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: I have to find it.
**Speaker 1**: I have to find that, that name.
**Speaker 1**: But I would say they're hot.
**Speaker 1**: I mean, that's an end.
**Speaker 1**: Jason had shoulder surgery and then we just haven't talked in like a year.
**Bclymer**: I mean, it says here Kinmar Construction is ready to design, bid and build your next commercial, residential or mixed use project.
**Speaker 1**: They don't do their own construction.
**Speaker 1**: They have like in house construction managers.
**Speaker 1**: Unless they just started in the last four months.
**Speaker 1**: Six months.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, they're, they're, they're.
**Bclymer**: They've got superintendents on staff, like, and that's new.
**Speaker 1**: And that's new in the last couple months.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So I didn't think I had to.
**Speaker 1**: Research them because they.
**Speaker 1**: I was looking at building stuff for them and we bid a project in Westfield, you know, five years ago for them.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I mean they got superintendents, assistive superintendents, project managers.
**Speaker 1**: Where did you see that?
**Bclymer**: On about us.
**Bclymer**: And I went to the team.
**Bclymer**: I know this guy.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Austin Young.
**Speaker 1**: Which one?
**Bclymer**: The Austin Young guy right there.
**Speaker 1**: Ken White.
**Bclymer**: Super.
**Speaker 1**: He looks like he's just a general super.
**Bclymer**: Cheese.
**Speaker 1**: They put everybody on here.
**Bclymer**: I mean, probably not everybody, but like just.
**Speaker 1**: They got maintenance engineers.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, they're just people that have been there.
**Bclymer**: I mean, for, for a bit.
**Bclymer**: I'm sure they probably had some that aren't listed, but.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, so like, you know, probably not.
**Speaker 1**: A hot one then.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And so that's where, you know, like, even if you think like this one, like you need to actually go in and research it so you're not wasting.
**Speaker 1**: Time because that'll be the only one.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: I promise you.
**Speaker 1**: I looked.
**Speaker 1**: I didn't look at them though.
**Speaker 1**: That's a bummer.
**Speaker 1**: So like companies like, like these peacock companies is one that I'd Never heard of here in Indianapolis.
**Speaker 1**: When I started looking up like small to mid size M.
**Speaker 1**: But I couldn't find their contact us so I got like this is a company I'll have to do more digging on.
**Speaker 1**: But this is a smaller, smaller guy that I would be a good one for us to look into.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Speaker 1**: Like, like I'm seeing renderings on here.
**Bclymer**: So Bay street commercial.
**Bclymer**: That looks like a real estate brokerage.
**Speaker 1**: They're a brokerage in Tampa Bay.
**Bclymer**: Yes, right.
**Speaker 1**: That I want, that I've been trying to get in contact with.
**Bclymer**: So I, I wouldn't put that on the same.
**Bclymer**: It's not level as Canal.
**Speaker 1**: It's not.
**Speaker 1**: I, I have over 24 developers on here and then I was started going down a rabbit hole of brokers in Tampa Bay area.
**Bclymer**: So yeah, you definitely want to delineate between you know, real estate brokerages and you know, actual developers.
**Speaker 1**: So I could do like.
**Bclymer**: Well click on, click on, go back.
**Speaker 1**: I could add a label here.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, go back.
**Speaker 1**: Back to what?
**Bclymer**: Back to the.
**Bclymer**: So back to click on Bay street commercial.
**Bclymer**: So right there, that's where you can put like you know again you can put the label down there under organization.
**Bclymer**: Right there.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: And then so you can put, add a label of you know, real estate brokerage.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, put them under the actual organization.
**Bclymer**: Just type in label.
**Bclymer**: So up at the top you got all labels selected.
**Speaker 1**: Talking about up here.
**Bclymer**: No, no, stop, you're moving too fast.
**Bclymer**: Left, left.
**Speaker 1**: So this just goes for this for the lead label.
**Speaker 1**: That's why I need to figure out how to see the company label.
**Speaker 1**: Or I can add a lead label.
**Speaker 1**: That's, that's developer and brokerage too.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, you can do that too.
**Speaker 1**: Then, then I can do like here I can go Bay street commercial.
**Speaker 1**: I can go.
**Bclymer**: Add new label.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Then I can organize her label.
**Speaker 1**: So I'll do that and, and then I, I want to, I don't know, what do you think is realistic?
**Speaker 1**: Like well that'll be enough work in itself.
**Speaker 1**: I'm ready to start reaching out to guys though, which I have already started.
**Speaker 1**: But find a target person for each company for next Thursday.
**Bclymer**: Yep, yep.
**Bclymer**: And again like you know, you need to go through and make sure like that you delineate to where you don't have you know, like, like that brokerage in there.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Speaker 1**: Well I'll be able to sort, sort these labels.
**Speaker 1**: So it's like okay, here's the developers.
**Speaker 1**: So like Pittman, just do it this weekend.
**Speaker 1**: You know anyone at Kittle, they're pretty big.
**Bclymer**: They're not.
**Bclymer**: I mean I say that, I say that now.
**Bclymer**: I, I made you know people move to different companies all the time.
**Bclymer**: Like so I mean that, that may not be the case but this is where what you could do is take your, you know, whittle down to the companies.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And then you can dump it into like chat GPT and say hey you know, I need find me the, the these people blah blah blah for these companies.
**Bclymer**: Put it in a spreadsheet, something like.
**Speaker 1**: That will chat gbt.
**Speaker 1**: Do that research the Internet and try and find.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Use, use what's called deep freeze.
**Bclymer**: You can use what's called deep research.
**Speaker 1**: So if I so like a company like click on certain would you say.
**Bclymer**: So so development, design, finance, construction.
**Bclymer**: Click on construction.
**Bclymer**: Scroll back up.
**Bclymer**: All right, now go back to about us, our team.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I didn't see them have like superintendents or anything like that.
**Bclymer**: So go back.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, keep scrolling.
**Speaker 1**: Then vice President of Construction and like driving down 82nd Street I saw a kiddle group like a kiddle sign but they had another GC working on it.
**Speaker 1**: So I don't know that one's, that one's definitely a maybe.
**Bclymer**: Construction title.
**Bclymer**: Vice President, Senior PM PM Procurement Manager, Equipment Project engineer.
**Bclymer**: Project engineer, Construction administrator.
**Speaker 1**: Where did you see that at?
**Bclymer**: I Click on what I told you to go to about us and team.
**Speaker 1**: Our team.
**Bclymer**: Scroll down, keep going.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, I didn't go down that far.
**Bclymer**: Nope, you're not, not patient.
**Bclymer**: So Erica E.
**Bclymer**: Scott, vice President of Development would probably be a great place to start.
**Bclymer**: I see that list of development keep going down.
**Bclymer**: So that would might be a place to start now again.
**Bclymer**: And that's in the five seconds I looked at this.
**Bclymer**: I don't know, you know, if, if it really is good because if they've got this construction, you know, which I don't see like a ton of field staff on here.
**Bclymer**: So it may be okay.
**Bclymer**: I don't know what they do as far as you know, construction wise.
**Speaker 1**: What about like a.
**Speaker 1**: Because obviously I can't get a audience with Paul Kite himself or Paul.
**Bclymer**: Why, why don't.
**Speaker 1**: Or Jeff Kittle.
**Bclymer**: I mean I, I, yeah like I said I would, I would start because, because Jeff Kittle is going to send you to if even if you do make an impression, he's going to send you to, to Erica Scott, Vice President, Development.
**Bclymer**: So I might start, you know, with her.
**Bclymer**: Erica Scott, like, you know, that might be a good place to start if it were me.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Well next week I'll have a nice list and I'll I'll pick the top 24.
**Speaker 1**: I think I have 31 developers on there, and I'll have a person for each one.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: And again, plan.
**Bclymer**: Sounds good.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: How's.
**Bclymer**: How's Dylan doing?
**Bclymer**: Good.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: We're gonna pow out here in a little.
**Speaker 1**: Trying to get the applied engineering updated, pricing out the door today, and working on the Danville theater.
**Speaker 1**: I met with him and Jesse this morning.
**Speaker 1**: So when I got back from Crate, and I got in from Crate, and we'll go from there.
**Bclymer**: Awesome.
**Bclymer**: All right, sounds good.
**Speaker 1**: I'll talk to you later.
**Bclymer**: Thanks.
