## Transcript
**Bclymer**: Way to do that.
**Jdawson**: Well, part of what's happening right now is the line item numbers are out of order, but it's putting it in order from cost code.
**Jdawson**: So that's, that's why.
**Bclymer**: Because I clicked this.
**Bclymer**: But if I do this sequential then it's weird.
**Jdawson**: Well, but then it puts it in, in line item order.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, but it's out of cost.
**Bclymer**: It's out of cost code.
**Bclymer**: So if I'm a, if I'm an owner and I'm reading this, I, I can't read like it doesn't make sense because the actual or you know, it needs to match what we actually submit to the owner, which it won't.
**Bclymer**: It looks wonky.
**Jdawson**: I will have to ask at this point.
**Jdawson**: It's, it's doing what it's being told to.
**Jdawson**: It's bringing up all available line items and it was populating it via Costco order, which is what we discussed having it do.
**Jdawson**: That's, that's right.
**Bclymer**: What I'm looking for is it to be able to do it needs to delineate between base contract and then the change orders.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I'll have to check on that.
**Jdawson**: Blank page, blank page.
**Bclymer**: So let's see here.
**Bclymer**: So this, this isn't even kicking out the change orders now.
**Jdawson**: Well, it is, it's putting it in with the.
**Jdawson**: Because I looked at that earlier.
**Jdawson**: It's rolling up the, the cost codes per your request into the individual.
**Jdawson**: It's not separating it from the, the contract and the change orders, but it's rolling up under the cost codes.
**Jdawson**: If you look at the verbiage, if you.
**Jdawson**: Sorry, I was looking at what you were doing.
**Jdawson**: If you were to do the select all line items thing, it's rolling it up within the cost code page.
**Jdawson**: Parent divisions, which is what we talked about you wanted it to do.
**Jdawson**: It doesn't break it apart from the contract parent divisions and then the change order parent divisions, it all lumps it together.
**Jdawson**: But in the page one of the then exported AIA invoice, it does talk about what changes were already approved.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: But it doesn't tell us so it doesn't show a percentage to do it.
**Bclymer**: So I, I wonder like when I come, when I come in here, like if I wanted to create a new, you know, contract, you know, come in here, you know, whatever.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Create everything.
**Bclymer**: And then I want to do my schedule of values.
**Bclymer**: Like I just add a line item and then I can pick, I can pick a code like say if I want to do this and then it'll let me edit the Description to put whatever I want and show.
**Bclymer**: But I don't think on yours.
**Bclymer**: We can do that.
**Jdawson**: No, you can put the description of whatever you want in there.
**Jdawson**: There is a description column.
**Jdawson**: You can't edit the description of the.
**Jdawson**: The cost code itself.
**Jdawson**: Like where you are right now, that won't change, but you can input your own description.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so like this one.01.
**Jdawson**: I'm sorry, let me rephrase that.
**Jdawson**: So in the contract, when you're doing the original schedule of values for the contract or the change order, that's where you put the description.
**Jdawson**: When you're pulling it into the invoice itself, you cannot adjust currently the description of the invoice.
**Bclymer**: This is building.
**Bclymer**: This is building.
**Bclymer**: If I were building a new contract, that's what this is.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Then, yeah, but like, so see here, like, like when I click on budget codes, like I click here and it allow me to do like, you know, kind of like what we were doing there.
**Bclymer**: And then I can put you.
**Jdawson**: You.
**Bclymer**: Know, exactly what, what I was wanting to do.
**Bclymer**: Is there.
**Bclymer**: Is there no way to.
**Bclymer**: To do that?
**Bclymer**: Or do we just have to like, it automatically generates these, you know, revenue codes essentially.
**Bclymer**: And so is that the only option we have to do is on yours?
**Jdawson**: Well, yeah, you would do it the same way if that's how you want it to read in the contract.
**Bclymer**: But we didn't put in.
**Bclymer**: We didn't put in the, like this 01 or 02.
**Bclymer**: Like those aren't actual costcos.
**Bclymer**: It's just because the.
**Bclymer**: The budget rolls up.
**Bclymer**: To hear how this all rolls up by division.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, that's adding it because I just created that.
**Bclymer**: But.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that's what our budget does.
**Jdawson**: As now you have it condensed and then if you, you know, click on the plus sign, it should break it down for you and then keep breaking it down until there's nothing else to break down.
**Bclymer**: So for yours, this says project manager, Labor, Superintendent Labor.
**Bclymer**: So you're breaking the cost type down here versus like what this is.
**Bclymer**: This just shows a 03, 3000M and S.
**Bclymer**: Is that how.
**Bclymer**: I guess if we had multiple.
**Bclymer**: Is that what yours would look like too?
**Jdawson**: It not quite like that, but yes, it would break that down in.
**Jdawson**: So for example, Project manager, labor.
**Jdawson**: If you had project manager.
**Jdawson**: Project manager.
**Jdawson**: Excuse me, materials.
**Jdawson**: Materials would then pop up underneath labor.
**Jdawson**: Like that one.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So it does break it down.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And then we may just have to create these new budget codes because it's the only way to get it to show up the way that it needs to Match the.
**Bclymer**: What we bill to the owner.
**Jdawson**: So could you.
**Jdawson**: That sample contract that you showed me where.
**Jdawson**: Not the contract.
**Jdawson**: I'm sorry, the invoice where you showed me where it was breaking down the.
**Bclymer**: This.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Where it has the contract.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Where it breaks out the contract pricing that you're invoicing and the.
**Jdawson**: Can you email that to support, please?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, sure.
**Jdawson**: Just because then when I talk to development about it, I can specifically show them like, this is what he's looking for.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah, I can shoot that over so that you have it.
**Jdawson**: Perfect.
**Jdawson**: That would be helpful.
**Jdawson**: Okay, thank you.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: And then so I guess so what we need to do.
**Bclymer**: What I'll do is I'll go in and I guess we'll just upload our.
**Bclymer**: Our cost codes and we'll do the parent ones of like what you just.
**Bclymer**: Like what I just showed.
**Bclymer**: So if I upload this.
**Bclymer**: So see, I rolled up everything like that.
**Bclymer**: Is.
**Bclymer**: Is that all you like?
**Bclymer**: Will that work or do I have to do something different?
**Jdawson**: Well, your cost codes racking my brain.
**Jdawson**: You're on acumatica.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Your cost codes actually are connected directly with acumatica.
**Jdawson**: So to add any sort of updates, it would have to come from acumatica.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So you would.
**Jdawson**: I can't remember who I talked to from your.
**Jdawson**: Maybe it was Jesse.
**Jdawson**: Maybe it was Jesse.
**Jdawson**: I don't.
**Jdawson**: I apologize.
**Jdawson**: I don't remember who I talked to about the cost codes.
**Jdawson**: But to get what you are looking for and you just want like that parent code to pop up on the contract, all you'd really have to do is whoever runs your acumatica or enters that administrative type information into your acumatica, just have them enter that parent code one more time as a subcode.
**Jdawson**: So you would see division was it 01 general requirements.
**Jdawson**: And then the first one under that would be like 0001 general requirements or whatever that first populated number would be.
**Jdawson**: Does that make sense?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that's all you'd have to do.
**Jdawson**: And then when you pull in the cost codes, you could just click that.
**Jdawson**: That one.
**Jdawson**: Which would then resemble your parent code without having to have that entire list underneath it.
**Bclymer**: Gotcha.
**Jdawson**: I think it was Jesse.
**Jdawson**: I'm pretty sure I.
**Jdawson**: Jesse and I were conversating about that, but yes.
**Jdawson**: And then essentially once.
**Jdawson**: Once that was done, you'd be able to replicate exactly what you did.
**Bclymer**: Is there a way, like.
**Bclymer**: So you see what I just did there?
**Jdawson**: So I said added money to the revenue.
**Bclymer**: Correct.
**Bclymer**: But it's not.
**Bclymer**: I thought it was supposed to show Me my over under.
**Jdawson**: Where are you on the change request?
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: So see here how this shows me my over under.
**Bclymer**: So this is how it looks.
**Bclymer**: So see here, if I look here, I got this change event attitude.
**Bclymer**: Prime pco.
**Bclymer**: Like this one.
**Bclymer**: So reformat here.
**Bclymer**: Prime pco.
**Bclymer**: And it tells me over under here, like if we lost or made money or whatever.
**Jdawson**: Oh, so you're looking for the over under on the change request page itself because there's an over under on the budget where that'll start calculating once.
**Jdawson**: Once everything is approved.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, no, I mean the, the change.
**Bclymer**: Having it on.
**Bclymer**: On the.
**Bclymer**: On the change event tells us.
**Bclymer**: I can instantly look at this and be.
**Bclymer**: Okay, where are we at on some of these?
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: I can, you know what's going on here and here, whatever that is.
**Jdawson**: What job do you have a change request on right now?
**Jdawson**: Just doesn't matter which one like.
**Bclymer**: And then when I expand it, it shows my markup and everything so I can see it.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: What.
**Jdawson**: Can you just throw a job at me with a change request on it just so I can take a quick peek at something?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So right here on 24, 115 Westfield.
**Jdawson**: Got it.
**Jdawson**: Let me just mark up tax total.
**Jdawson**: Oh yeah, so it's not.
**Jdawson**: We can't really adjust the columns on this one yet.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: It's like this has tax.
**Bclymer**: We don't need that.
**Jdawson**: Okay, I see.
**Bclymer**: This splits it up.
**Bclymer**: Revenue cost, really easy.
**Jdawson**: No, I just wanted to see with most of our modules you can kind of pick like what you see in the columns.
**Jdawson**: I just wanted to see if there was an option.
**Jdawson**: And it's.
**Jdawson**: It's not built out yet.
**Bclymer**: The.
**Jdawson**: This change request function is still relatively new.
**Jdawson**: I believe they finished this shortly before I started working for them last summer.
**Jdawson**: So we're kind of building it up as people give their suggestions because not every.
**Jdawson**: Not everyone uses the change request.
**Jdawson**: So as suggestions or comments come in about.
**Jdawson**: Hey, did you think of this?
**Jdawson**: That's usually when development will look at it.
**Jdawson**: So if you want to send me a separate email or send support, I apologize.
**Jdawson**: A separate email just requesting that.
**Jdawson**: And then a screenshot or an attachment.
**Bclymer**: Showing that I'll send you this so you have it, you know, so that way they have a reference.
**Jdawson**: Yep, perfect.
**Jdawson**: That would be great.
**Jdawson**: And then just make sure that's a separate email from the other one you're going to send me because.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, don't want to.
**Jdawson**: Two different tabs on that.
**Bclymer**: I will.
**Bclymer**: And then so like for commitments.
**Bclymer**: So like when I come in here to this commitment okay, so like, it, it only lets me add one person.
**Jdawson**: Correct.
**Bclymer**: So how can we get it to add multiple people?
**Bclymer**: Because like, for instance, most places they might have like a pm, but then accounting is the one that gets in here and does invoicing and stuff.
**Bclymer**: So you need to be able to have multiple people to be able to get into a contract, a commitment, and view it for that company.
**Jdawson**: Well, this is a perfect example, actually.
**Jdawson**: You would just have to add the accounting contact to that company card.
**Jdawson**: So if you were to open up that card, I don't know if it'll let you at the project level.
**Bclymer**: And that's another thing.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, so like, is there not a way or like, can we figure out a way where we can add people in a job?
**Jdawson**: Because you can add people in a job.
**Bclymer**: Well, okay, so like in this job, right.
**Bclymer**: So how can I add somebody to Legacy?
**Jdawson**: So there, that's, that's kind of the, the catch there is you can, you can add new people, new companies to a project at the project level, but if you're trying to add a new person to a company that already exists, you're going to end up making a duplicate company.
**Jdawson**: So if you're just adding a new contact for an already existing company, you're going to want to go to the address book and you can just add them in the address book.
**Bclymer**: The thing is, there's plenty of PMs that are not on all the same jobs.
**Bclymer**: And so if they could add it in the project level versus having to back out and go into the whole hq, like that's, that would be huge.
**Bclymer**: If I come in here and I want to just come in here and I go to just.
**Bclymer**: So I just click here, I go to Directory.
**Bclymer**: And then like, you know, I can look at all the, you know, here's all the companies to say I wanted to Glenmark.
**Bclymer**: Right?
**Bclymer**: Here's their, their people.
**Bclymer**: Like if I want to click into the Glenmark, I can look on users and I could say add user and put in their info.
**Jdawson**: That's exactly what you do in Job Planner.
**Jdawson**: But you just go to Contacts instead of.
**Bclymer**: Right, you go, you go out to.
**Bclymer**: I understand you go out to the, to the parent project.
**Bclymer**: So the hq, you know, come over here, step out of it, go to Contacts, you know, then I go to Legacy.
**Bclymer**: Well, I guess they're here.
**Bclymer**: Legacy Fire.
**Bclymer**: And then I don't know how, how do I add them from here?
**Jdawson**: Double click.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And then there's the Contact Edition right there.
**Jdawson**: No, above it.
**Jdawson**: Add new contact.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, but you Know, I don't necessarily want guys to have to come all the way back out here and do this.
**Bclymer**: I mean, are you guys planning on putting the directory in the actual jobs?
**Bclymer**: You got to think about like, you got to think about the guy in the field who like, knows how to build but isn't a computer guy.
**Bclymer**: That's who we have to tailor some of this stuff to.
**Jdawson**: I do agree, but there's only so much we can do at one time.
**Jdawson**: I have not heard of anything at this point, and you are at least the first of my customers to bring up something like that.
**Jdawson**: Most people have not had an issue adding a new contact just through the address book.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And then so once I add them to the address book, they'll.
**Bclymer**: They'll be able to go in there and see the contract.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So can other companies go see other.
**Bclymer**: Other subs Contracts?
**Jdawson**: No.
**Bclymer**: So basically anybody at that company that's registered could see that contract if they.
**Jdawson**: Are registered and that contact has the permission to do so?
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so with within a company, let's say you have a project manager, an accountant, and an estimator, and all three have permission to view the contract that that company is on.
**Jdawson**: They could log in and look at that contract only because their company is on there.
**Jdawson**: However, you could go in and edit at the contact level where why does the estimator need to see a finalized contract for a project?
**Jdawson**: You could turn his permissions off and he won't be able to see that particular commitment at the personal level where everyone else in the company then would still be fine and able to see.
**Jdawson**: All depends on how you have it set up.
**Jdawson**: So if you were to set up multiple contacts within a company, you could then have an initial contact, probably the project manager for the initial contact.
**Jdawson**: Then you could have the accounting invoicing contact.
**Jdawson**: And if there's someone else you still have to send that to when you email it out, you can add their email addresses.
**Jdawson**: And as long as you have their permissions on to see that contract, they can log in and see it.
**Jdawson**: Their.
**Jdawson**: Their specific name should not have to be on it if the company itself is on it.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so do you see how this budget, it's showing, you know, these were added, but it's not yet budgeted.
**Jdawson**: Correct.
**Bclymer**: So I have my original budget and then I had, you know, this is a change order that's filled out.
**Bclymer**: So how does that like.
**Bclymer**: So first of all, I don't know why this labor one is here.
**Bclymer**: See, it's got zeros all the way across.
**Bclymer**: Is There a way to delete that or why does that show?
**Jdawson**: Try doing a right click modifications at you're not.
**Jdawson**: Oh, you're locked.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: It's possible that there used to be something on the labor and it got moved or edited at a later date.
**Jdawson**: Theoretically, if all those are zeroed out, you should be able to delete that off with a right click and delete.
**Jdawson**: But I do notice that your budget is locked.
**Jdawson**: Not a huge deal.
**Jdawson**: You can unlock it if you want, delete it and then re lock it.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, try.
**Jdawson**: Right click, hit delete and we'll see what pops up.
**Jdawson**: There we go.
**Jdawson**: All gone.
**Jdawson**: So chances are there was something on there and it just got edited.
**Jdawson**: But as long as the line item is 0, you should be able to delete it.
**Bclymer**: So I just add to budget here because these, these are change orders.
**Bclymer**: Is that going to do that every single time I click something?
**Bclymer**: See what I mean?
**Bclymer**: Like when I click this add a budget rolls it all back up.
**Jdawson**: And it rolls it back up.
**Jdawson**: I think right now that's just the.
**Jdawson**: The program essentially refreshing itself and changing the information as I don't think it normally does that.
**Bclymer**: All right, well, so I will.
**Bclymer**: So I'll send you the change events page so you can see what that looks like in the contract to separate emails.
**Jdawson**: Perfect.
**Jdawson**: And then I will.
**Jdawson**: Yep, I'll get those off to development then once I receive them from you and I will reach back out once I hear something back from them.
**Bclymer**: All right, thank you.
**Jdawson**: Thank you, sir.
