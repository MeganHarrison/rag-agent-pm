## Transcript
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Hey, Jerome.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Hey.
**Speaker 1**: Morning.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Good morning.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: I thought it'd be easier for us just to chat real quick.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Always let me share my screen here.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: So, I.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: I saw the comments back.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: It looks like you already got on getting that site planned.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Yep.
**Speaker 1**: It was just the one comment.
**Speaker 1**: I mean, things kind of, like, seemed odd that he couldn't get that.
**Speaker 1**: Get that figured out with what we had sent him.
**Speaker 1**: But, you know, we got it.
**Speaker 1**: Got it.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Cool.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: So I had received this FedEx tried to hold up here.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: They tried to submit for, like, a sign permit.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: And I've specifically told them many times, Wait for me to get my permit before you do anything.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Yeah.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: And this Molly girl, here's what she sent.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: She said our science vendor tried to submit signage to the city.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: And they received the following comment.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: I'm sure you guys are aware.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Yada yada.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Please tell your clients that an ADL s amendment application.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Will be necessary for this scope of work at this building.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Site plan, architectural elevations and floor plans.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: And detailed for signage, lighting and landscaping will be required.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: I don't think they understand the aspect of it.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: So we have the site plan now.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Done.
**Speaker 1**: Yep.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Right.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: We have the architectural elevations.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: We have the floor plans or signage, lighting and landscaping.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: I'm going to kind of leave that up to them.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: I mean, landscaping.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: We're only.
**Speaker 1**: I mean, I would just with.
**Speaker 1**: With Carmel, you know, because they get pretty specific.
**Speaker 1**: I mean, I would talk to just tell them that we're basically replacing.
**Speaker 1**: Replacing what's there.
**Speaker 1**: And anything that's disrupted, we will move.
**Speaker 1**: You know, we will keep those counts.
**Speaker 1**: And.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, just make sure that all the counts are maintained.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: And they'll probably come up with a comment as soon as I submit.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: So I.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: I filed the application.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: They won't let me until I have that CDR and send them the cdr.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: They won't even look at it is what they told me.
**Speaker 1**: Huh.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: So, yeah, look, here's.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Yeah, here's what I got from them.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Revisions have been requested for the following permit application.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Application will not be processed until an approved state CDR Is provided.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: So I don't know if that's a new thing.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: It's new to me.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: I've done it in Carmel before.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: And I usually just give the number.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: And they do it congruently.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Right.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: I haven't seen.
**Speaker 1**: I mean, like I said, when we typically don't.
**Speaker 1**: It's for whatever reason.
**Speaker 1**: I mean, we always kind of file with the state and we file with Indianapolis.
**Speaker 1**: But every project that I've done in Carmel has been filed by Them by the con, you know, by the contractor.
**Speaker 1**: Really?
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Yeah.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: I'm used to.
**Speaker 1**: I don't see it.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So I don't see this a ton, but I know that.
**Speaker 1**: I know that other projects I was not.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: I mean, I know that they were reviewing stuff at the same time anyway.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: So I, I let them know.
**Speaker 1**: I'll.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: I'll contact the code services.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: I'm currently working on permitting a.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: A path we're putting in for a school or the civil guy, so.
**Speaker 1**: Yep.
**Speaker 1**: But I would, I would hope that.
**Speaker 1**: I mean, Marcus, I've worked with him on a bunch of stuff before.
**Speaker 1**: He's usually pretty, you know, usually pretty good.
**Speaker 1**: So I would hope that with.
**Speaker 1**: With getting that updated, with it being so simple that he's that.
**Speaker 1**: Well, I would hope that we might even possibly have that today.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Okay, cool.
**Speaker 1**: They like to get stuff off their.
**Speaker 1**: Off their plate if it's easy.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: For sure.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Okay, well, good.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: We're tracking on that.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: I just had a couple comments about this.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: So.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: And if you don't mind making these changes, that would be great.
**Speaker 1**: For sure.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Yeah.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: So I mean, this is pretty self explanatory.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: And your one comment.
**Speaker 1**: And I can check with him again, but I know your one comment.
**Speaker 1**: I mean, they do have the structural.
**Speaker 1**: Does have the opening, you know, for the art for the rtu.
**Speaker 1**: That was one question I had.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Oh, where.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Where is it at?
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: I can't find it.
**Speaker 1**: If you go.
**Speaker 1**: Go to their drawings, I think it's one of the first ones that's like in the bottom left of their kind of sheet.
**Speaker 1**: That one right there.
**Speaker 1**: Oh.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Provides steel frame around all.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: There's just some angle it looks like.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Yep.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Well, that helps.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: I appreciate it.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Yeah.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: So we're good there then.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: And then.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Okay.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: So I noticed that you didn't have any walls on the exterior.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Is that right?
**Speaker 1**: Correct.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Okay, that's.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: That's perfect because I don't want to have to do them if I don't have to.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: My second question is, do you see any code issue because it's the same occupancy with leaving this back side of the drywall off on this and making the other tenant pay for it when the time comes, we have to have a one hour separation.
**Speaker 1**: No, I don't think between these.
**Speaker 1**: I mean, even between B and M, I don't think there was a one hour separation requirement between.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: I'm sorry, B and M.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: What's that?
**Speaker 1**: Between the, between the grocery.
**Speaker 1**: I mean, between B and B.
**Speaker 1**: Not right here.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: There's no dry.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: There's no drywall on this side right now, so.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Yeah, so then we shouldn't have to put drywall on this side, right?
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Go.
**Speaker 1**: If you go to.
**Speaker 1**: Go to our G003 sheet, since you got it up there.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: G0.
**Speaker 1**: Which one's that or the life safety?
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Life safety.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: This one?
**Speaker 1**: No.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So, I mean, I.
**Speaker 1**: I was not showing the one.
**Speaker 1**: I was not showing a one hour separation there.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Yeah, but it.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: I mean, it will be eventually a one hour separation.
**Speaker 1**: I don't think.
**Speaker 1**: I don't.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I don't think you need it.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Well, because it's in a one hour separation.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Drywall, stud insulation, drywall.
**Speaker 1**: I mean.
**Speaker 1**: Yes, it is.
**Speaker 1**: That is like, that's usually.
**Speaker 1**: I mean, you can easily do that.
**Speaker 1**: Right?
**Speaker 1**: Because it is the one hour wall.
**Speaker 1**: Is.
**Speaker 1**: Is that simple?
**Speaker 1**: Okay, Simple.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Well, it's just more for like, hey, FedEx.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: If they're requiring it, you know, we're not.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: We're not gonna do it, so.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: And what it does do is it also gives a little bit of future proofing in case that like, future work, in case they want to stick like, you know, like a little bit of a restaurant or coffee shop or, you know, something like that in there.
**Speaker 1**: I mean, it does.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Yeah.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: It allows the wall to be open for outlets.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Etc.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Yep.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: So.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Okay, good.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Oh, what other question?
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Okay, this front right now, you show this as glass.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: And I know FedEx showed it.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: We didn't include for that to be glass.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: So can you make that.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: We have.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: I've included for a storefront entrance right.
**Speaker 1**: Here.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: But just change that to walls.
**Speaker 1**: Sure.
**Speaker 1**: Yep.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: And then can you make all of these walls just go above ceiling, you know, six inches right here.
**Speaker 1**: Yep.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: This is the only one that'll go to deck.
**Speaker 1**: Which one?
**Speaker 1**: Sorry?
**Speaker 1**: The.
**Speaker 1**: Just the back wall today.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Just the demi.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Just the demising wall will go to deck.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Okay.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: So this.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Oops.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: So this one here and then there and then all of these can just go, you know, 12 foot tall, right above ceiling.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Okay.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Other than that, I think we're good on that site plan.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Can you show a little bit of concrete here?
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Because we're gonna have to pour something.
**Speaker 1**: We.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, we do.
**Speaker 1**: On the.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: If you go to the AU0 on the A1,101 or A1.
**Speaker 1**: We do have that.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Do you?
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Yeah, man, I need to look at these closer.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Don't.
**Speaker 1**: All good.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: I didn't see it.
**Speaker 1**: Three note.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: I mean, that note.
**Speaker 1**: What is that note?
**Speaker 1**: Three.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Oh, three.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: It's this box.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Yep.
**Speaker 1**: And then We've got that back here too.
**Speaker 1**: Yep.
**Speaker 1**: Yep.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: We'll just move it.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I think that was.
**Speaker 1**: That may have been based off of the.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: An old one or something.
**Speaker 1**: Original.
**Speaker 1**: The original plan.
**Speaker 1**: But then.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I didn't get that moved over here, but that should be all.
**Speaker 1**: That should be easy.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: And then.
**Speaker 1**: Sorry.
**Speaker 1**: Go.
**Speaker 1**: Go zoom back into those restrooms there.
**Speaker 1**: Just these.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: So we have those called as a 3s.
**Speaker 1**: So we have.
**Speaker 1**: We can go in and change those to like, whatever.
**Speaker 1**: It'll be like a C3S.
**Speaker 1**: Something like that.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: There is a.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Where's your wall types?
**Speaker 1**: If it's not in here, we will.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Usually it's a 001 sheet.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Structural.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Structural.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Structural.
**Speaker 1**: Sorry.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Demo plan.
**Speaker 1**: Keep a.
**Speaker 1**: Let's see.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Next one maybe.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, Maybe we need to add.
**Speaker 1**: Maybe we need to add that sheet.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: If you don't mind putting wall types in there.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Yep, that'd be great.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Cool.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: I think that's it.
**Speaker 1**: Cool.
**Speaker 1**: So making the sidewalls solid.
**Speaker 1**: Those are just.
**Speaker 1**: And those are.
**Speaker 1**: Framing will go up to the ceiling, but drywall will only go up six inches above on the.
**Speaker 1**: On the vestibule.
**Speaker 1**: Is that right?
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Yeah, because it's drop ceiling throughout that whole area.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: So.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So only the.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Do we have to have a hard lid in that vestibule?
**Speaker 1**: I mean, it's probably.
**Speaker 1**: It's probably.
**Speaker 1**: Bet it's probably easiest to do that.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: I'll go ahead and just do a hard lid in there.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: That's fine.
**Speaker 1**: The question would be like, do they have anything on their drawings to put like a little space.
**Speaker 1**: Space heater in there?
**Speaker 1**: Sometimes.
**Speaker 1**: Sometimes those.
**Speaker 1**: Sometimes those can get larger than kind of a typical.
**Speaker 1**: You know, those can get a little bit large.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: So you saying the space heaters, as far as like wall thickness just in.
**Speaker 1**: Terms of like, where that.
**Speaker 1**: You know, if we've got the light in there.
**Speaker 1**: Just making sure that everything is.
**Speaker 1**: Fits in there.
**Speaker 1**: Well.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Not what I wanted.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Over 3 SD2.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: They just have a diffuser going in there.
**Speaker 1**: Gotcha.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, yeah, they've got that.
**Speaker 1**: I mean, it looks like it's.
**Speaker 1**: It's taken into account.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: So.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, just sidewalls, updating bathroom walls, changing that wall type and then adding the wall.
**Speaker 1**: The wall type sheet.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: I think that's it, man.
**Speaker 1**: Cool.
**Speaker 1**: All right.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: I'm sure you've been on.
**Speaker 1**: You've been on the.
**Speaker 1**: Any of those comments from the state.
**Speaker 1**: So you will see stuff whenever I see it, I'm sure.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Yep, I have been.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Yeah, I saw it was.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: That was one of the things I was going to ask you about and then of course they.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: You replied that you already submitted it.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: So.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Appreciate you.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: I have.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Well, I got you.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: So I got a project and it's a really unique one, so.
**Speaker 1**: Our specialty.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: I know you gotta go here in a few minutes.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: It's not a big project, but it's for a guy that's going to be doing big things in Danville.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: He, he's the county trustee.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: He's.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: He's the old.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: He's the old police chief.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: I mean he.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: And he, I did all of his great clips for him.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: He used to own.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: He's the biggest great Clips franchise he.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: In Indiana.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Okay.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: And he just sold his whole portfolio and so he's got money, he wants to invest.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Well, he, he bought a while back in cash.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: He bought this, build this, the old Danville Theater.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: They call it the Royal Theater.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: And he bought it for like 500 grand a steal.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: And he put a bunch of money into it.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: See if I can find these photos.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Yeah.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Like it's like you're walking into the 1930s or something.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Or something.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Yeah.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: That's the entrance, but above it there's two apartments.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Okay.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: And they're, they're in shambles.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: I mean it's an old building.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Okay.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: But he wants to turn them.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: He wants to start doing like wedding events here and he's buying.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: His next step is to buy the building next door.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: And we'd like to eventually, in a couple years, bust that door down, bust that wall down and create like a wedding event space where people can do weddings here and with Airbnbs above in these two apartments.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: And I gave the idea in my very minor sketchup skills about a year ago to do.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: To turn.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Because there's so much head space.
**Speaker 1**: Yep.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: To turn one of them at least into a loft to make it three bedroom, you know, two bath.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: I'm no architect.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: We put like a spiral staircase.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Point load below.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Got a little bathroom in there.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: This was me when I was like taking it off to try and price it for them.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: I built this and then we could, we could put our MEPs in this little attic space.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Is this something you guys like?
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: It's more of a residential project.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Is it something you guys would have time for?
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Should I try to reach out to someone else?
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: My feelings wouldn't be hurt.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: I just don't know who to call.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, no, let me send over everything that you have.
**Speaker 1**: Let me just check with the, the guys here.
**Speaker 1**: I mean, is there anything to like, is there anything with The.
**Speaker 1**: With the venue.
**Speaker 1**: Like, obviously you said you'll be doing the venue space.
**Speaker 1**: Is there anything with that.
**Speaker 1**: Is this the.
**Speaker 1**: Is this the theater or how does the.
**Speaker 1**: This is the upper floor of the.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: This is above the theater.
**Speaker 1**: Is he doing anything with the.
**Speaker 1**: With the theater or not?
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Not.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: It's just not right now.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: He's.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: He.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: I don't think he wants to chew that much off yet.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: He's.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Yeah, it's kind of indecisive.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: But if you can get me a fee.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: I mean, hey, if you really want to go this route, it's going to cost X amount of money, you know, like, I have a lot of the bones there, but, like, for.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Just to, like, design it and get, like, know what joists we have to install, you know, all of that stuff, you know, finishes gonna be pretty easy.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: He's gonna, you know, it's gonna be residential finishes.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: But, yeah, look, let me.
**Speaker 1**: Let me check with the guys.
**Speaker 1**: Only midnight.
**Speaker 1**: I only know.
**Speaker 1**: I only.
**Speaker 1**: My only hesitation is that we really don't do anything like single family residential.
**Speaker 1**: But this is a little bit.
**Speaker 1**: You know, obviously, there's two.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: There's two apartments.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: And which is more.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: I think in the state of Indiana, you don't.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: For anything under four units, you don't even have to have, like a registered architect.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: But this is way beyond my skills to be able to draw.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So, yeah, send over everything that you.
**Speaker 1**: That you.
**Speaker 1**: That you have on there.
**Speaker 1**: So any kind of description of that.
**Speaker 1**: Of that scope, and we'll get it figured out because, yeah, it does seem like a.
**Speaker 1**: Does seem like a cool one.
**Speaker 1**: And then obviously, any of that work that's around there, too.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Well, the idea is.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Yeah, I mean, I'm doing this as a favor.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Like, this isn't even a job that we would sniff at if it wasn't Bill.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: So.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: All right.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Oh, yeah, we're working.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, we've done, like, a lot of this.
**Speaker 1**: Like, if.
**Speaker 1**: I mean, event.
**Speaker 1**: Event spaces, we've put airbnbs on top of, like, music venues.
**Speaker 1**: We're working on the Crump Theater down in.
**Speaker 1**: Down in Columbus right now, so.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Oh, you're working on Crump Theater, Man, I was.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Have they picked a contractor yet?
**Speaker 1**: They.
**Speaker 1**: It was the contract.
**Speaker 1**: Well, they haven't officially, but we.
**Speaker 1**: A contractor that was.
**Speaker 1**: That we know down there was the one that actually brought us in, so.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Oh, okay.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Yeah, I was calling on the girl.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: It would have been a year ago because I was trying to.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: I heard something about it in the news, and yeah, I was like, hey, I'd love to help build, but.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I mean, I would.
**Speaker 1**: I mean, there's.
**Speaker 1**: They should.
**Speaker 1**: I actually talked.
**Speaker 1**: I talked to him last week and he said that there was a press release going out last Wednesday.
**Speaker 1**: I haven't.
**Speaker 1**: He didn't forward it.
**Speaker 1**: After he told me that it was being sent out, he didn't forward it to me.
**Speaker 1**: So I want to.
**Speaker 1**: I was.
**Speaker 1**: I meant to kind of track that down and see actually what got released because I know that there's another one with a little bit more details on there, but it's kind of.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, it should be a.
**Speaker 1**: Should be a cool one.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Yeah, that's a unique project.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: That's cool.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Well, I'll send this stuff to you and then.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Do you remember creating like a life safety plan and helping us with the permitting way a couple years ago at that Bella Maryland project?
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Bella Radial, Maryland.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: I mean, when we added like a little cold room.
**Speaker 1**: That one I.
**Speaker 1**: That one.
**Speaker 1**: I don't recall ever.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Well, you guys did the life safety for us on it.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Okay.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Maryland, right?
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I think.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: I mean, you should.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: I.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: I would assume you are.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: If you did.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Right here.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Radial MD drawings.
**Speaker 1**: What year was that?
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: 2022.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: This is you guys, right?
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: What.
**Speaker 1**: What stamp is on that thing?
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Brian's State of.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, is it.
**Speaker 1**: Did it say Missouri?
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Oh, wow, that's interesting.
**Speaker 1**: Huh?
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: It went through.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: We got it permitted.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: So, ma'am, maybe there's reciprocal.
**Speaker 1**: I mean, it's.
**Speaker 1**: I mean, there is reciprocal, but not.
**Speaker 1**: I mean, that's.
**Speaker 1**: To get.
**Speaker 1**: There's reciprocal to get that Bearland stamp.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Whoops.
**Speaker 1**: So, yeah, if.
**Speaker 1**: If it is.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Yes, continue.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Anyway, I was gonna have.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: You guys.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: We're gonna build a big break room over here.
**Speaker 1**: Yep.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: And I.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: I gave him.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: I start putting a budget together.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: So I'll send you the info on this one too.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: But since you guys already did it, it makes sense for you guys to do it again.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, let me check.
**Speaker 1**: Let me check.
**Speaker 1**: Maryland.
**Speaker 1**: I actually see it here.
**Speaker 1**: Maryland Life Safety.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Yeah, they clearly maybe not didn't look at the stamp.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So if it is.
**Speaker 1**: Let me.
**Speaker 1**: Let me check because I'm not sure.
**Speaker 1**: I don't think I've come across a Maryland stamp before.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, so.
**Speaker 1**: But obviously if it is, I don't think we want to.
**Speaker 1**: I don't think we want to keep putting a Missouri stamp.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: No, no, no, no.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: I don't.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: That's.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: That's crazy.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: I didn't.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: I mean, I don't.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: I just see a stamp.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: I don't look.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: See what city a lot of time, but I'm gonna start paying attention to that now.
**Speaker 1**: Shouldn't you should not have to pay attention to that.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Really?
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Well, they approved it.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: The job's been done for two years now.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Anyway, I'll send you this info, too.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Okay?
**Speaker 1**: Yep.
