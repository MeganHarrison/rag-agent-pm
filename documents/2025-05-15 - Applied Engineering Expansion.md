## Transcript
**Lydia**: So you know.
**Lhoran**: I thought everyone was slice of countless.
**Lhoran**: Room one.
**Lydia**: Okay.
**Mlehman**: Thanks.
**Lhoran**: Hey, good morning.
**Mlehman**: How are you guys?
**Lhoran**: Good, how are you?
**Mlehman**: I looked this morning at the meeting and I.
**Mlehman**: I thought it was a call.
**Mlehman**: So thankfully our office, five minutes.
**Mlehman**: Ready to log on now.
**Lhoran**: I guess everyone thought it was a call.
**Lhoran**: I.
**Lhoran**: I had conference room one.
**Mlehman**: But no, I asked.
**Mlehman**: I'm glad you said.
**Mlehman**: I'd way rather be in person anyways.
**Lhoran**: It.
**Lhoran**: Yeah.
**Lhoran**: Okay.
**Lydia**: Markers too.
**Lydia**: So latest.
**Lhoran**: Might not be the latest now speaking stuff today.
**Lhoran**: Okay.
**Mlehman**: Sarah sent the most updated one this morning.
**Lhoran**: Oh, let's grab that one.
**Ataylor**: Good morning.
**Lhoran**: Good morning.
**Lhoran**: We will share our screen here in a minute.
**Bclymer**: Sure.
**Ataylor**: Thanks for adding the teams invite.
**Ataylor**: I appreciate it.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Lydia**: Innovate.
**Lydia**: Split it up and you.
**Lhoran**: Yeah, that's welcome.
**Lhoran**: We are.
**Bclymer**: I just did my desk.
**Bclymer**: I walked on and I saw.
**Bclymer**: Wait a second.
**Bclymer**: That's our conference room.
**Lydia**: So let's come down here.
**Lhoran**: All right, we got that pulled up.
**Lhoran**: Are we expecting more?
**Lhoran**: I'm a leader.
**Lhoran**: Okay.
**Mlehman**: Brandon may join.
**Mlehman**: He's at our Tampa office.
**Jdawson**: I'm.
**Jdawson**: I'm on the call right now.
**Lhoran**: Oh, there you go.
**Lydia**: Good.
**Lhoran**: Okay.
**Lhoran**: Libby, you want to run through the changes that have been made or how do you want to just kind of overall.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: I wonder if we start with the items that Sarah sent in her email this morning that were.
**Ataylor**: We picked up all the changes and then the comments that you all had sent back yesterday on the attached drawings that are dated 5:15.
**Ataylor**: So she kind of put some bullet points of some remaining information that you all needed and then Sarah, I can let you comment on.
**Ataylor**: I know you got a call this morning from I think Brandon about the door, your last bullet point.
**Ataylor**: So we can talk about that too if you want to start there, then we can kind of back into the other items.
**Sarah**: Yeah, sure.
**Sarah**: Brandon had good ideas because I don't know if you saw my comment, but you guys had requested a larger four foot door at the break room there.
**Sarah**: Unfortunately, because of the size of the break room, because of the number of occupants in that space, we are not allowed by code to have a barn door.
**Lydia**: So.
**Sarah**: So right now we were showing a 48 inch door swinging into the room, but the problem is that it will overlap your existing tv.
**Sarah**: So Brandon and I chatted through a few ideas and the quickest, easiest idea is just to flip that door out into the hallway instead.
**Sarah**: And I did confirm that we do have enough clearance in the hallway that that is acceptable by code.
**Sarah**: So we could just flip that door, make it swing out into the hallway.
**Sarah**: If you did have a strong preference for it swinging in.
**Sarah**: Braden's other ideas were to show two smaller two foot, you know, like a double door or have a three foot door with an inactive leaf.
**Sarah**: So I think it just depends what how you guys will be using that room and if it's important for it to swing one direction or the other.
**Sarah**: But it is allowed to swing out to avoid overlapping your tv.
**Lhoran**: Okay.
**Lhoran**: And just to comment, everything on the break room cafe is a alternate.
**Lhoran**: Yeah, we're gonna try to contain that.
**Lydia**: Okay.
**Lhoran**: I guess we'll just go with the 48 swinging out then.
**Sarah**: Okay, we'll make sure to update that.
**Lydia**: Okay.
**Lhoran**: And then you said you want to talk a little more about the acoustic panels.
**Ataylor**: Yes, we wanted to get an idea.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, we just wanted to get an idea of what you were looking for for those.
**Ataylor**: We've used some in the past.
**Ataylor**: I wanted to know if you have anything specific in mind that you've had good experience with in the past or with the Alito Group, if there's a product you're comfortable with installing or that you've seen done and done well.
**Ataylor**: So wanted to open the floor for discussion on those requirements and then if we could nail down a spec or we can provide some options, that'd be great.
**Lhoran**: Yeah, let us look around a little bit on that.
**Lhoran**: We've done a few sound studios and things that we, you know, some good information for you there we could find from another project.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: And that's something that I'm not a deliverable.
**Ataylor**: I'm not meaning to put on you all by any means.
**Ataylor**: So we can.
**Ataylor**: I could definitely ask our interior directors here products that they use in the past, but in the instance where we haven't used a product often, I don't want to recommend something that could have a faulty or kind of an odd install and something that the Alito Group would be comfortable with.
**Ataylor**: So let us know how we can help on that and we're happy to propose some options as well.
**Lhoran**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: And then we did pass along the link to the canlights that you had requested.
**Ataylor**: So we had.
**Ataylor**: Sarah had sent a link in that email this morning.
**Ataylor**: Is there anything that you're specifically concerned about or any questions we could help answer with those?
**Ataylor**: That is a product we've used often, so we can maybe help answer those questions if you have any.
**Lhoran**: Looks like they're led, of course.
**Lhoran**: And.
**Bclymer**: Or anything.
**Bclymer**: Just a six inch.
**Lhoran**: Six inch can.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, looks good.
**Lhoran**: Let's go.
**Mlehman**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Okay, great.
**Ataylor**: So past that, all the comments were picked up in the drawings I don't think we need to do a full page turn of those unless you have some items that you want to talk about specifically.
**Ataylor**: Just because I think through some of our back and forth, those have had a thorough pass through.
**Ataylor**: So all of your comments, and Sarah, correct me if I'm wrong, all those comments have been picked up to date from kind of the highlights that we've had and then the comments that they've sent back.
**Sarah**: Yes, I believe so.
**Lydia**: Run through real quick here.
**Mlehman**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: And is there anything that you all maybe want to talk about specifically related to some of those comments and what we had picked up for you?
**Ataylor**: I think, you know, Emma had gone through and done some of the finish plan work today, so she's been dropping out finishes to you all.
**Ataylor**: So happy to run through them, but I don't think it's necessarily required again, since we've done a lot of back and forth, but we can talk about anything you'd like.
**Lhoran**: This is probably more for Alito the conversation of the demo and what you might be putting up in regards to temporary wall or anything.
**Lhoran**: Given that thought.
**Lhoran**: There's going to be a lot of noise.
**Mlehman**: Yeah, there will be.
**Mlehman**: So our initial thought, and I think when you were working with Brandon and Jesse, they came up with this.
**Mlehman**: Putting just a temp wall up and getting everything done on this side.
**Mlehman**: That way you guys are still operational.
**Lhoran**: Yeah.
**Mlehman**: Looking at it.
**Mlehman**: When I walk through with our framer, I don't think there's going to be enough space there for the eyes to access.
**Lhoran**: These cubes are inactive.
**Lhoran**: We are in everybody.
**Lydia**: You can move your.
**Lhoran**: You can do a temporary wall right up to those cubes.
**Lydia**: Yeah.
**Lydia**: Oh, you did okay.
**Lhoran**: We moved all those people.
**Bclymer**: Well, I'm not sure.
**Bclymer**: Crap might still be there.
**Bclymer**: I looked the other day, I was.
**Mlehman**: Like, wait a second.
**Lydia**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So they'll put you full access.
**Mlehman**: Yeah, we were gonna build a temp wall kind of on this column line or wherever those cubes stop.
**Lhoran**: Yeah.
**Mlehman**: All the way around that way you.
**Lhoran**: Can still get to the break room.
**Mlehman**: If we're doing break room work or if we're not doing break.
**Lhoran**: Yeah.
**Mlehman**: Depending on.
**Lhoran**: Yeah.
**Lhoran**: That might be the final phase.
**Lhoran**: If we do so, that wall, you know, is great right along, you know.
**Mlehman**: This, this and that allows this out or back up.
**Bclymer**: Temporary wall.
**Bclymer**: Get that down the hallway.
**Bclymer**: I assume we need an exit out.
**Lhoran**: This is our exit.
**Bclymer**: At some point in time, we've got a stairwell.
**Bclymer**: If there's ever a fire or something else we can just.
**Bclymer**: I'm not saying we have to use It.
**Bclymer**: But some way to like exit the building of some sort.
**Lhoran**: Yeah, yeah.
**Mlehman**: So we would.
**Mlehman**: We would have all access going in and out of it.
**Lydia**: Okay.
**Mlehman**: At that point the other option is just doing a fill in here in this opening and this opening over here.
**Bclymer**: And then at some point it'll self tear it out.
**Mlehman**: And then, and then we will have to tear down those walls.
**Lhoran**: It'll be the last wall.
**Mlehman**: It'd be the last wall.
**Mlehman**: I'm gonna tear off everything on this side and can get all the electrical out of there.
**Mlehman**: Whatever's needed.
**Lhoran**: And so the temporary.
**Lhoran**: The infill would be plaster walls and you would basically.
**Bclymer**: Plaster walls.
**Lhoran**: I mean to give you noise.
**Mlehman**: We would hang.
**Mlehman**: We would hang it with drywall.
**Lhoran**: That's one.
**Mlehman**: But if we have enough room, I'd rather just build a temp wall because then we can take that wall totally out of there.
**Mlehman**: Okay, well take the tempo down today.
**Lhoran**: I think you do.
**Mlehman**: We'll use eliminator track and that way it's just attached to the underside.
**Mlehman**: And then we could put hot rivets in there to.
**Lhoran**: Okay.
**Mlehman**: Make it look pretty when we remove.
**Lydia**: Yeah, yeah.
**Lhoran**: I, I would like to keep the noise somewhat down and I think that wall won't.
**Mlehman**: It'll definitely help.
**Mlehman**: I mean there's going to be some noise now.
**Mlehman**: The guys start at 6am so whenever we're shooting track, anything noisy we'll try to get done.
**Mlehman**: Okay.
**Mlehman**: Before people come in.
**Lhoran**: Yeah.
**Lhoran**: There's something that will be here.
**Lhoran**: Markets here early in others, but for the most part it's a sweet.
**Mlehman**: And then as far as getting it like material in and out of the building, we'll pop a window out.
**Mlehman**: Oh, and we'll.
**Mlehman**: We'll boom it from the front.
**Mlehman**: We had.
**Mlehman**: We were out here two weeks ago, measuring the distance.
**Mlehman**: It's close, but we can reach, I believe from the front walk to this window in the new space that we're taking over.
**Mlehman**: So it's about the only option.
**Mlehman**: It was either that or we go over there.
**Mlehman**: You guys are still going to be occupying it and we're going to try for this.
**Lhoran**: Okay.
**Lhoran**: Yeah.
**Lhoran**: I mean, I don't know what landlord clearance you need there, but taking a window down.
**Mlehman**: But that, that was.
**Mlehman**: Yeah, well, that was one question.
**Mlehman**: I didn't know.
**Mlehman**: I don't think Houston's on this, but I, I didn't know whether to ask you guys or Houston who the landlord contacted.
**Lydia**: Okay, perfect.
**Lhoran**: Yeah.
**Mlehman**: Because I want to start that conversation.
**Mlehman**: Obviously, you know, we send out a weekly report and we'll have a Weekly meeting.
**Mlehman**: I think we're doing a bi weekly meeting with parallel design too.
**Mlehman**: Just good to keep them in the loop, obviously, on everything we're doing.
**Lhoran**: Good.
**Lhoran**: Okay.
**Lhoran**: Well, if.
**Lhoran**: If you.
**Lhoran**: If you think you can build along this corridor and still give us this access, that's going to be important, you know, whatever that is.
**Lhoran**: A foot in or some 18 inches.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I.
**Jdawson**: I think originally what we were going to do was just infill that opening there right there so that you had full access to that hallway.
**Lhoran**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And then that way at the.
**Jdawson**: At when we went.
**Jdawson**: When everything else is done, we take that wall down and it's done.
**Jdawson**: Because if memory serves me correct, those existing walls go up through the grid and.
**Jdawson**: And so that's going to be a better sound.
**Jdawson**: Exactly.
**Jdawson**: Versus if we just do eliminator track and take it down and.
**Lhoran**: Okay.
**Lhoran**: There's probably less cost too, you know, because you just been filling right there.
**Mlehman**: The easier is the infill for sure.
**Mlehman**: But it really all depends on your guys.
**Mlehman**: Are you going to be okay with us, you know, for a couple days?
**Mlehman**: We're gonna have to.
**Lhoran**: That's right.
**Mlehman**: Tear all that down.
**Lhoran**: Yeah.
**Mlehman**: It's gonna be noisy.
**Lhoran**: Yeah.
**Lhoran**: And maybe.
**Lhoran**: Maybe just for.
**Lhoran**: For that last while.
**Lhoran**: You do that on the weekend.
**Mlehman**: Yeah, we can.
**Lhoran**: You can price that.
**Mlehman**: Yeah, that way.
**Mlehman**: Do it on a Saturday.
**Lhoran**: Yeah, just do that on the Saturday.
**Lhoran**: That last piece.
**Mlehman**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Ammo.
**Mlehman**: Yeah.
**Lydia**: Perfect.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Lhoran**: That.
**Jdawson**: That hallway.
**Jdawson**: 100% building a temp wall doesn't make sense.
**Jdawson**: You know, that was always.
**Jdawson**: We were going to use that.
**Jdawson**: It's the shared wall that we had some flexibility.
**Jdawson**: So I think that that that's probably the best route to use it and then come back at Saturday.
**Mlehman**: Okay.
**Lhoran**: Anything else on demo?
**Lhoran**: I can think of, Laura.
**Jdawson**: Real quick while we're looking at these drawings.
**Jdawson**: So that break room door that we are now going to swing out that Sarah mentioned, I wanted to ask you guys, do you have a preference on if that swing is left or right as far as like, I don't know.
**Jdawson**: I don't know if there's anything on that.
**Jdawson**: If it swings out.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Jdawson**: If there's anything on that wall or whatnot.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Bclymer**: It needs to swing.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, let's swing right.
**Bclymer**: The hinges should be on the right side.
**Jdawson**: So swing clear.
**Jdawson**: Right?
**Lhoran**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: I'm not sure what that means, but.
**Jdawson**: So swing.
**Jdawson**: Swing clear means that that door can go 180 degrees versus normal hinge.
**Jdawson**: It's going to let you go 90.
**Jdawson**: So swing clear is going to allow that to go all the way back to the wall, right?
**Lhoran**: Yeah.
**Mlehman**: Okay.
**Lhoran**: Right here.
**Lhoran**: Basically laying on the wall, probably open most of the time.
**Jdawson**: I say is that, that was the next question is do you intend for that door to be open or closed or do you have a preference?
**Bclymer**: It'll probably be open most of the time.
**Bclymer**: My, my gun says yeah, I bet, I bet I can count on one hand or two the times it'll actually be closed in a year.
**Jdawson**: So with, with that being said, I would, I would suggest that you do a, a hold open of some sort.
**Jdawson**: So like you can just do a manual hold open.
**Jdawson**: Basically a hook on the floor so that door stays open and then when you want it shut, you just unhook it and shut it.
**Bclymer**: But why the whole open?
**Bclymer**: Why not?
**Bclymer**: Isn't it.
**Bclymer**: I mean it doesn't have a closer on.
**Bclymer**: It wouldn't just stay open if you.
**Jdawson**: I mean but the door, door can, it's free moving like I mean we're so.
**Ataylor**: Yes, you can do that.
**Ataylor**: The hold open will allow the door to stay more at that open position firmly.
**Ataylor**: Whereas to Brandon's point, you know, draft when someone walking by someone touching it, I mean it would shut very easy.
**Ataylor**: Those hinges are, are, you know, they work pretty well.
**Ataylor**: So I think a hold open is a, is a good idea.
**Mlehman**: It's just a piece of hardware that we're very familiar.
**Mlehman**: Yeah.
**Lhoran**: Yeah, I guess that's, I mean.
**Jdawson**: It'S whatever you guys want.
**Jdawson**: It's just an idea.
**Bclymer**: It doesn't matter to me.
**Bclymer**: It's.
**Bclymer**: I'm assuming you can even get some of those that fit on the door and just kind of have a bit pushed down.
**Bclymer**: Correct.
**Bclymer**: Have kind of a stopper foot on it.
**Jdawson**: At the, at the bottom, you mean?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I guess, I guess that's what I'm trying to figure out if we're going to agree to something.
**Bclymer**: I guess I've seen anything from a foot that flips out at the bottom that's attached to the door or you've got a hook loop type system behind the door or magnetic.
**Bclymer**: So I, I guess I, I would.
**Jdawson**: Not do magnetic because it's the, the cost you, you only do magnetic if you have an egress.
**Jdawson**: So that way the door, the firearm goes, it shuts the doors and you have a barrier for, for this door.
**Jdawson**: I mean Sarah, could be if I'm wrong.
**Jdawson**: I think just a little flip foot one is perfect.
**Ataylor**: Yep, that seems easy.
**Lydia**: Good.
**Lhoran**: So.
**Mlehman**: The reason for the door is for noise, correct?
**Lhoran**: Yeah.
**Mlehman**: So you guys can shut it when it gets too loud.
**Lhoran**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And when they have Those big chili cook offs.
**Jdawson**: Everybody's getting rambunctious.
**Lhoran**: Well, we're throwing around a foosball idea too.
**Mlehman**: Oh, nice.
**Mlehman**: Very kind of loud, so.
**Lydia**: I don't.
**Lhoran**: Think we need to spend much time.
**Lhoran**: There's your demo.
**Lhoran**: How the lights turned out here.
**Lhoran**: So went all pans.
**Lydia**: Right.
**Lhoran**: No pendants lighting in here.
**Lhoran**: We're reusing these now.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: It's about their space.
**Lhoran**: So 460, relocating these four into the new room.
**Lhoran**: That's these.
**Lhoran**: These are existing fixtures.
**Mlehman**: Yep.
**Lhoran**: So they're relocates, if you will.
**Bclymer**: If we can send it in a title, that'd be preferable, I guess.
**Bclymer**: Well, I guess they're not centered in this one now, are they?
**Bclymer**: But somehow it'd be nice to.
**Lhoran**: Center them as best possible.
**Mlehman**: Yeah.
**Lydia**: Just.
**Mlehman**: Are you saying center them on like a.
**Lhoran**: This vertical and then.
**Bclymer**: I mean this is fine.
**Bclymer**: Left and right.
**Bclymer**: I mean this is supposed to be in the middle of tile.
**Bclymer**: This one looks the middle of tile.
**Bclymer**: This one probably bump up 2 inches or whatever.
**Bclymer**: And this one just bump up know.
**Mlehman**: Yeah, I.
**Mlehman**: I hear.
**Ataylor**: We consider.
**Ataylor**: We consider all of those.
**Lhoran**: Yeah.
**Lhoran**: Great.
**Lhoran**: Okay.
**Lhoran**: Act Gyp.
**Bclymer**: Wait, no, it's ACT Also.
**Lhoran**: Why is this.
**Lhoran**: What is that?
**Bclymer**: Oh, that's like carryover.
**Bclymer**: They'll delete that.
**Bclymer**: That was when it used to be JIP in the middle.
**Bclymer**: I'm assuming that'll get deleted.
**Lhoran**: Yeah.
**Mlehman**: We were gonna do a bulkhead going over the conference.
**Bclymer**: We got rid of that.
**Lhoran**: We.
**Lhoran**: That was the latest.
**Lhoran**: Yeah, so we got rid of it.
**Lhoran**: Plaster ceiling.
**Lhoran**: Sheetrock ceiling in here.
**Lhoran**: Can lights, the ones that we just looked at.
**Lhoran**: And then are these linear slot.
**Lhoran**: That must be.
**Bclymer**: No, those are.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, those are your diffusers.
**Lydia**: Yes.
**Lhoran**: Correct.
**Lhoran**: Yeah.
**Lydia**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: And those can lights are color tunable.
**Ataylor**: So we can color match those back to what your two by fours and standard color temperature in your office are.
**Bclymer**: Should all be 3,500.
**Ataylor**: Yes.
**Ataylor**: That's how they're noted on the drawings.
**Ataylor**: But sometimes you get in there and you're surprised what it actually is.
**Ataylor**: So we just want to make sure you have something that's adjustable.
**Lydia**: Wonderful.
**Lhoran**: While we're talking about the ceiling, we've got the mechanicals that we did.
**Lhoran**: I will send you a PDF set.
**Lhoran**: But we are, you know, talking about a couple new boxes and.
**Lhoran**: And the basement is reusing the rest of these.
**Lhoran**: It's the only updated controls.
**Lhoran**: Right.
**Lhoran**: And I'll send this so you can send it to your team.
**Lhoran**: But you know, basically we've got the demo showed all the demo work.
**Lhoran**: Nothing new work.
**Lhoran**: There's one of the new boxes, I think one down here.
**Mlehman**: And then where's the computer?
**Mlehman**: I know we talked about putting the mini split right here.
**Lhoran**: This cru.
**Mlehman**: Okay.
**Lhoran**: Computer room unit.
**Lhoran**: Yep.
**Lhoran**: And we've got some details here.
**Lhoran**: And then we also show the kines on the roof.
**Lydia**: Okay.
**Lhoran**: That goes down.
**Lhoran**: That hits that bathroom chase.
**Lhoran**: This helps.
**Lhoran**: So you can get.
**Lhoran**: We can get.
**Lhoran**: We can get this set off to a mechanical.
**Lhoran**: We did schedule all the terminal boxes because the alternate is to replace them.
**Lhoran**: So when you do the alternate you'll be referring to the replacement.
**Lhoran**: But there's also a couple of two I think in here that are new.
**Lhoran**: That is part of the base, right.
**Lydia**: It's 19 and one which is the two that are in this area.
**Mlehman**: Okay.
**Lhoran**: Yeah.
**Lhoran**: Yeah, I think so too.
**Lhoran**: Okay.
**Lydia**: Yeah.
**Lhoran**: It has shown that data in telecom and the data.
**Lydia**: You don't need to really worry about data.
**Lhoran**: We're going to bid out ourselves.
**Mlehman**: Right.
**Lhoran**: So they'll coordinate with.
**Lydia**: But we've got a 120.
**Mlehman**: Will you want us to put ringing strings in the wall for your data guy?
**Mlehman**: So usually I'll have my electrician come in and he'll put those conduits in there.
**Lhoran**: So then he pulls anyways there for him when he comes.
**Mlehman**: Yeah, we usually.
**Mlehman**: Because data's usually.
**Lydia**: Yeah.
**Mlehman**: You guys have your own data guys?
**Lhoran**: Yeah.
**Mlehman**: Usually exclude that.
**Mlehman**: Yeah.
**Mlehman**: You guys can just handle them.
**Jdawson**: Well, let's, let's, let's be clear too.
**Jdawson**: Like the.
**Jdawson**: I heard the word conduit and raceway.
**Jdawson**: Are you guys wanting that in the wall or Typically with this kind of.
**Jdawson**: It's just a string that they pull through the wall.
**Lydia**: Two inch between our tv.
**Lydia**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So for David.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: She'd just be opening the wall.
**Mlehman**: Correct.
**Bclymer**: I would have the faceplate that's cut off or the.
**Bclymer**: It's not in a back box.
**Lydia**: What's it?
**Mlehman**: I call it.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Just a mud ring.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Exception to that.
**Mlehman**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Mark.
**Bclymer**: Another 2 inch conduit for the TV and then also to below the conference room table, right?
**Mlehman**: Yep.
**Lhoran**: And it's going to be nice to.
**Mlehman**: Have something as far as power layout.
**Mlehman**: I haven't had the chance to compare this to what Lydia's team shows on their drawings.
**Mlehman**: So we'll have to make sure that we go off of this.
**Lhoran**: Yeah, I think it's pretty.
**Mlehman**: Is it pretty close?
**Mlehman**: Yeah.
**Lydia**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: It is close.
**Ataylor**: But I would say for any applied specific drawings that those need to be used for the, you know, record of construction.
**Ataylor**: Our drawings and intent were put in to help us through permitting but to document them.
**Ataylor**: But I would say all final drawings from applied applied to be the last point of construction.
**Lhoran**: Then we conceal the.
**Lhoran**: I mean, you know, mechanical and electrical.
**Lhoran**: I assume we're getting a permanent.
**Mlehman**: Yeah, we're getting a permanent.
**Mlehman**: Although lady, you said that your.
**Mlehman**: Your drawing should be sufficient.
**Lhoran**: Right.
**Ataylor**: For permitting.
**Mlehman**: For permitting.
**Lhoran**: That's.
**Ataylor**: Yep.
**Ataylor**: So we permitted to the state and I'm pretty sure that those were released.
**Ataylor**: And so we typically.
**Ataylor**: Typically the contractor handles the city and our drawings that were used for the state, the ones labeled permit set.
**Ataylor**: And if you need to resend those, I can.
**Ataylor**: Can go to the city.
**Ataylor**: What happens is when we get this far along into revisions.
**Ataylor**: This is called the construction set.
**Ataylor**: So we just want to make sure Alito Group that you're permitting the permit set that was permitted to the state.
**Ataylor**: So that those match.
**Mlehman**: Yep, we will.
**Mlehman**: Okay.
**Lydia**: So There's a few 120 volt circuits we called out because.
**Lydia**: To each of the VAV boxes.
**Lydia**: Yeah.
**Lydia**: And then why is that?
**Lydia**: 120.
**Bclymer**: That's what I was gonna say.
**Bclymer**: Just in the electrical room running 24 volts and everything.
**Bclymer**: But.
**Lydia**: Well, if there's no controls.
**Lydia**: Contractor.
**Lydia**: I didn't know if there was.
**Lhoran**: Oh yeah.
**Lhoran**: Did.
**Lhoran**: Did you work that out with Dave?
**Lhoran**: Okay.
**Mlehman**: Yeah.
**Lhoran**: Okay.
**Lydia**: He said run that.
**Bclymer**: That's your pepper.
**Lydia**: The.
**Lydia**: Then we got 208 to the BAB to the crack and to the.
**Lydia**: The second.
**Lydia**: Yeah.
**Lydia**: This VAV is also.
**Lydia**: Both the new base ones are too heavy.
**Lydia**: The rest of them, if we change them out at all, they all have power to them already.
**Lydia**: Perfect.
**Lydia**: So we noted which ones were dedicated receptacles.
**Lydia**: But you know, we're not circuiting all that stuff.
**Lydia**: So you guys can circuit it the way you have.
**Lydia**: But where there's a B, that would be a dedicated 20amp.
**Mlehman**: And I was going to look through the notes.
**Mlehman**: Did we determine is this going to be a piece of furniture or are we going to actually do built in casework for this?
**Lhoran**: I was thinking it was a piece of furniture.
**Lydia**: Well, I don't know.
**Bclymer**: What do you guys want that's built pretty much at this point with the cabins and everything.
**Bclymer**: It's.
**Bclymer**: Correct me if I'm wrong, but.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, sorry.
**Bclymer**: We're talking the break room.
**Bclymer**: That is.
**Bclymer**: That's built in.
**Mlehman**: Correct.
**Bclymer**: I want to make sure you get the right term.
**Ataylor**: Your.
**Ataylor**: Your island casework.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, that's correct.
**Ataylor**: It's.
**Ataylor**: It's millwork.
**Lydia**: So we were thinking you could come out of the wall, go through, not have to.
**Mlehman**: That's more much easier than coring.
**Lydia**: And this is really?
**Bclymer**: 1.
**Lydia**: The data that are can be in the same.
**Mlehman**: Yeah.
**Mlehman**: When we do our submittals, we'll submit.
**Mlehman**: Usually there's a.
**Mlehman**: Like a quad with two data outlets or something that.
**Lhoran**: Yeah, there's two.
**Bclymer**: Okay, that's fine.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, it's probably an eight inch poke through if I had to guess.
**Bclymer**: Because for the 2 inch kind of going through is what's going to make it bigger than.
**Lydia**: Yeah, yeah, we.
**Lydia**: We might.
**Lydia**: Well, I need to show that to the 2 inch back to the back of it.
**Lydia**: Or you want to take it over?
**Lhoran**: Okay, so we'll add that before we send this.
**Lydia**: Yeah.
**Lhoran**: Okay.
**Mlehman**: Sweet.
**Lhoran**: And then power the roof for the condensing unit.
**Lhoran**: Is that 208 or does he say.
**Lydia**: Yeah, it says right here just 208R to the unit on the roof and then that powers this unit that's in the actual.
**Mlehman**: And I haven't been in this room.
**Mlehman**: I don't know, Brandon, if you have, but is this where your panels are located?
**Bclymer**: No, no, no.
**Mlehman**: Oh, okay.
**Jdawson**: Which room is it?
**Jdawson**: A.J.
**Mlehman**: I didn't.
**Mlehman**: I haven't seen where the panels are located yet.
**Lhoran**: I don't go back up to them.
**Lhoran**: Maybe not.
**Lydia**: You can go to this plan.
**Lhoran**: There you go.
**Bclymer**: Right there.
**Mlehman**: Right there.
**Bclymer**: Number four, page four.
**Jdawson**: That's.
**Jdawson**: It's.
**Lydia**: Yeah, yeah.
**Mlehman**: Right there.
**Mlehman**: Right there.
**Lhoran**: And then electrical is an electrical is right here.
**Bclymer**: Perfect.
**Lhoran**: Yeah.
**Mlehman**: I was just making sure there wasn't like a common electrical room for all the people on this floor.
**Jdawson**: No, there's a little.
**Jdawson**: There's a little chase.
**Jdawson**: I remember in that.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I just don't know where the dividing line is.
**Lhoran**: Right.
**Bclymer**: I mean at this point I don't know if the binding line's here, so it'll all be ours.
**Bclymer**: But I.
**Bclymer**: I know that I don't have some electricians in there before that weren't something that we needed.
**Bclymer**: They had to go in there for something.
**Bclymer**: I just don't remember what.
**Lydia**: There's telecom RAs in there for the different providers.
**Lydia**: So yeah, the other thing, we're going to have whips.
**Lydia**: So power and data will come from here, here and here for our cubicles.
**Lydia**: And then we have one power tower that would come, you know, as part of the cubicle sign there.
**Lydia**: But we will have like a build out here to get our data down.
**Lhoran**: And then we couldn't do it from one.
**Lhoran**: Right.
**Lhoran**: We had.
**Lydia**: We can do up to three.
**Lhoran**: Too far of a run.
**Lhoran**: Yeah.
**Lydia**: Too many cubicles.
**Lhoran**: Yeah.
**Mlehman**: So this is really the only one that's going to be.
**Lydia**: Those three will be off this and Then these fed off one here and then over on this side.
**Lydia**: We'll have one there.
**Lydia**: Perfect.
**Lhoran**: New exit sign.
**Lydia**: Well, I showed them on there, but.
**Bclymer**: They'Ve already got lighting plan.
**Bclymer**: They know the exit.
**Mlehman**: I don't.
**Lydia**: I put a sensor here, but I don't know if that shows up on the lighting plan or not.
**Ataylor**: I would also say that our emergency lighting is not only for permit but for point of reference.
**Ataylor**: But we.
**Ataylor**: All of those final locations should be confirmed with, you know, your actual fire suppression system vendor.
**Lhoran**: There might be an electrical room here too.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Lhoran**: Isn't that.
**Lhoran**: Have you walked past there?
**Lydia**: I have not.
**Lhoran**: I think one of these because I know there's a mop sink down here, but I thought that they're usually.
**Mlehman**: When I get with the property management team, they'll have to give us access.
**Mlehman**: You probably have sub panels in here, I would think.
**Mlehman**: And then I'm just gonna say.
**Lydia**: I mean we've got some.
**Lydia**: There's a 50amp, there's a 20amp.
**Lhoran**: Oh, there's a fair amount here.
**Lydia**: Yeah, there's.
**Lydia**: There's going to be a number of circuits because you.
**Lydia**: What do we.
**Lydia**: This would be three circuits here, I think.
**Lydia**: Circuit, circuit or two circuits here.
**Lhoran**: So there's three inch though per circuit.
**Lhoran**: I think is what we're not.
**Lhoran**: Yeah.
**Lhoran**: So two circuits here.
**Lhoran**: These three can be M1, plus you got your miscellaneous.
**Lydia**: So there's a number of circuits.
**Lydia**: Yeah.
**Mlehman**: Well, we'll download and we'll come walk it.
**Lhoran**: Okay.
**Mlehman**: Make sure that we're able to get access.
**Bclymer**: We can see that door's open.
**Bclymer**: I mean our l.
**Bclymer**: The door to our lush room's open all the time.
**Bclymer**: I've walked out.
**Mlehman**: Okay.
**Mlehman**: Yeah.
**Lydia**: It has some tape on the.
**Lydia**: On the.
**Lhoran**: Oh, is that why.
**Lhoran**: Okay, let's see.
**Lydia**: We did go on the roof.
**Lydia**: That's why we place that the condensing unit where.
**Lydia**: No, it is exposed to that plumbing, Chase.
**Lydia**: So that's the reason.
**Mlehman**: Okay.
**Lydia**: That on there for you?
**Lydia**: Just so you'd have a feel.
**Mlehman**: Yeah.
**Mlehman**: Now this.
**Mlehman**: This really helps.
**Lydia**: We'll get that updated with the 12 inch condo then.
**Lydia**: I think it should be.
**Lydia**: Do you just get with the fire alarm contract?
**Lydia**: How does it work?
**Lydia**: It's more like notification devices.
**Mlehman**: My electrician will do the fire alarm.
**Lydia**: Okay.
**Mlehman**: Whoever the building fire alarm is usually.
**Mlehman**: I don't know if it's Corson or se.
**Mlehman**: Or whomever, but we'll get with them.
**Mlehman**: We'll get with the property management team.
**Lydia**: Okay.
**Mlehman**: And that's who we'll get with whenever we're actually Working on the system.
**Lydia**: Okay.
**Lydia**: Okay.
**Lhoran**: How.
**Lhoran**: How quick can you guys get a price together?
**Mlehman**: If you guys can give me the plans today, give me to the end of next week.
**Lydia**: Okay.
**Mlehman**: Middle into next week.
**Lydia**: Yeah.
**Lhoran**: Better.
**Mlehman**: Better.
**Mlehman**: Yeah.
**Lhoran**: Just I want to mobilize soon.
**Lhoran**: Maybe the better question is after we get a price and figure it out.
**Lydia**: We agree to it.
**Lhoran**: How fast can you get moving?
**Mlehman**: As soon as we can get that indie permit.
**Mlehman**: I'm okay.
**Mlehman**: I don't know.
**Mlehman**: Brandon, your thoughts about potentially starting a little before we actually receive the permit?
**Mlehman**: We just won't be able to get an inspection until.
**Jdawson**: Let's, let's, let's get the permit submitted first.
**Lhoran**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And connect with the landlord.
**Jdawson**: And then let's.
**Jdawson**: Again, let's get their thought because we can sit here and say whatever we want, but all it takes is for us, you know, and they're banging hammers.
**Jdawson**: Somebody complains, landlord comes up, says, where's your permit?
**Jdawson**: And we don't have one.
**Jdawson**: And then they're shutting us down.
**Jdawson**: It just looks bad.
**Jdawson**: So let's, let's just go ahead and get it in for permit.
**Jdawson**: We've already got the cdr.
**Jdawson**: It may come back faster than we think.
**Lydia**: That sounds good.
**Lydia**: And you're talking about the end of that space where you actually walk into the building is where you're thinking taking out windows.
**Lhoran**: I'm thinking.
**Mlehman**: Right.
**Lhoran**: One of these.
**Mlehman**: Yes.
**Mlehman**: So this is the entrance.
**Lydia**: Yeah.
**Mlehman**: So it would have to be this one, this fifth window.
**Lydia**: Oh, okay.
**Lydia**: So we would be on that side.
**Mlehman**: On that side.
**Mlehman**: Yeah.
**Mlehman**: Okay.
**Mlehman**: We have to put cones out and I need to confirm that with the owner of the building.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Mlehman**: But there's no way we fit.
**Mlehman**: You know, I, I think we can only fit like 8 foot material in that elevator.
**Lydia**: Yeah.
**Mlehman**: And I don't think they want us bringing a bunch of stuff through.
**Lydia**: Right.
**Lhoran**: They've got it before.
**Lhoran**: They have that carpet there, the elevator and bring stuff up.
**Mlehman**: And creek was very finicky.
**Lydia**: I don't know what these people will be like.
**Lydia**: Or it's cast group.
**Lydia**: I say seller.
**Lydia**: They were the previous landlord, but now.
**Lydia**: And this, this group we really haven't dealt with.
**Lydia**: So we don't know how they operate as far as we can only do certain hours and getting stuff up.
**Mlehman**: Ultimately that's going to be up to them and how they want me to get it.
**Mlehman**: Ideally, I'm going to push for being able to boom everything through this window.
**Lydia**: Yeah.
**Mlehman**: Whichever one it ends at.
**Bclymer**: So it'd be this fifth window.
**Mlehman**: Well, it's just not fun to have to carry all that.
**Lydia**: Oh, yes.
**Mlehman**: Those sheets are pretty heavy.
**Lydia**: Yeah.
**Lhoran**: As long as you get the window cleared with the landlord, you know, kind of thing, so that we want his cool for sure.
**Mlehman**: So back to how soon we can start.
**Lhoran**: Yeah.
**Mlehman**: Ultimately at the mercy of the landlord and the city, you know, Carmel.
**Lydia**: Carmel, not Carmel.
**Mlehman**: This is Indy.
**Mlehman**: Indy is.
**Mlehman**: You never know what you're going to get as far as how soon you can get, so.
**Lhoran**: Well, the question was more about your capacity to do the work.
**Lhoran**: You get caught up on another project and you don't have manpower.
**Mlehman**: Right now we're good to go.
**Mlehman**: We got superintendents ready.
**Mlehman**: So I'll be handling this project.
**Jdawson**: Trust me, it's in my best interest for us to get started sooner rather than later.
**Lhoran**: Good, that's.
**Lhoran**: That's the tough ticket.
**Ataylor**: Just for reference, we've been seeing the city turnaround close to two weeks as of recent.
**Ataylor**: Like, you know, it was mentioned that could change at any time or vary.
**Ataylor**: But in those two week period times, time frames, you know, we have construction administration under our scope with you.
**Ataylor**: Also, if you want to start sending us submittals that we can help review and then pass you all for a final look, you know, this is the time to do that.
**Ataylor**: So there's plenty of work.
**Ataylor**: And even after those submittals are complete, ordering material, getting those on site so that when construction's rolling, you know, there's a good progression of construction for you all.
**Ataylor**: So in those two weeks, we'll have plenty to do to get it to the point of construction.
**Lydia**: Coe nd is who we're gonna probably have.
**Lydia**: Like they'll have a whip that they can bring into your electrician to tie in and that type of stuff.
**Lydia**: So we'll coordinate them with you.
**Mlehman**: Yeah, and I'll.
**Mlehman**: I'll get a schedule together, a final construction schedule, and then we'll get everything repriced.
**Mlehman**: The alternates repriced, get those to you, we'll start putting a contract together.
**Mlehman**: That's why I wanted to get ahead of getting you guys in our system.
**Mlehman**: And then.
**Lhoran**: Do I owe you something on that?
**Mlehman**: No, you guys got it?
**Mlehman**: Yeah.
**Mlehman**: You got.
**Mlehman**: Got me the W9 and that's what it was.
**Lydia**: We're good.
**Mlehman**: Ready to rock and roll on that.
**Lydia**: So.
**Lydia**: Okay.
**Lhoran**: And then.
**Jdawson**: Hey, Sarah, do you want submittals sent to you or is there somebody particular who's going to be the point person for parallel?
**Ataylor**: I'll review submittals.
**Ataylor**: Lydia will and then Emma, who's also on the call, who's been handling a lot of the Finished work will help.
**Ataylor**: Review those and pass along any information as well.
**Jdawson**: Well just so in our project manage software.
**Jdawson**: I just need to know who we should put in as the person.
**Jdawson**: Is that you?
**Jdawson**: You want it to be you?
**Ataylor**: Yeah, that'll be fine.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Do you feel like this is a 12 week.
**Ataylor**: What's your timeline for construction if you have a tentative one of completion.
**Ataylor**: Are we 12 weeks?
**Ataylor**: Eight weeks.
**Ataylor**: What do you think?
**Lydia**: Yeah, they can't do that.
**Jdawson**: I would say.
**Jdawson**: I would say 12 to 14 of actual construction time.
**Mlehman**: I can see if like my car.
**Mlehman**: You want to keep this table?
**Lydia**: Yeah, we're going to keep this and put it over there.
**Lydia**: It comes apart it pieces but.
**Lydia**: And that's what COE did for us last time.
**Bclymer**: I thought the balance will fit in Cub.
**Bclymer**: You know those torque cubes out there.
**Bclymer**: Is that just from that side of the column?
**Lhoran**: Not going to store it.
**Bclymer**: Oh, I don't know where else we're.
**Lydia**: Going to store it at.
**Bclymer**: I mean I don't think they want to work around it.
**Mlehman**: No, I do not want to work.
**Bclymer**: I knew it splits into three so I had that thought.
**Bclymer**: The idea with those cubicles empty.
**Bclymer**: If we can just sit in a cube pushed against the back.
**Bclymer**: Well.
**Lydia**: Well I could tell.
**Lydia**: I can tell co the engine and just.
**Bclymer**: Unless you have a spare garage.
**Lhoran**: Yeah, she was gonna stall.
**Lydia**: They were gonna store it.
**Bclymer**: Doesn't cost anything for them to do with it.
**Bclymer**: I guess I'm fine with that.
**Bclymer**: I just.
**Lydia**: I don't know.
**Bclymer**: Everything else I remember we moved the cubicle snowbox to this one.
**Bclymer**: And just seemed like everything got again it wasn't that it was somebody else but moving it anyway.
**Lydia**: I'll find out.
**Lydia**: I prefer they take it apart because.
**Bclymer**: They put back together.
**Lhoran**: Correct.
**Lydia**: So at least maybe they take it apart and we'll see if they can store it.
**Lydia**: If there is a.
**Mlehman**: If they can't for some reason just let me know and we'll figure out how to make it happen.
**Lydia**: Yeah.
**Lydia**: Okay.
**Lhoran**: For now just keep this out of your cause and then we last.
**Lydia**: Yeah.
**Lhoran**: Let you know we need to get.
**Lydia**: That's good about the chairs too.
**Lydia**: Stick those in those cubicles.
**Lhoran**: Should we have somebody modify this pass throughs in the middle of the table.
**Bclymer**: Well, that'll be what COE will do.
**Lhoran**: Will they do that?
**Lydia**: Yeah, we'll have to ask them.
**Lhoran**: Okay.
**Lhoran**: So schedules 12 to 14.
**Lhoran**: We're going to be two to three kind of waiting for permits.
**Lhoran**: You guys will be able to start doing some submittals.
**Lhoran**: Of course everything will come after approved costs.
**Lhoran**: I don't want you spinning your wheels until we get to see a number first.
**Lhoran**: And hopefully the end of next week or mid next week.
**Lhoran**: Do that.
**Lhoran**: So 16 weeks.
**Lhoran**: What.
**Lhoran**: What are we looking at?
**Lhoran**: Let's.
**Lydia**: Four months from now.
**Lhoran**: Yeah, just kind of cur.
**Mlehman**: Yeah, we're looking at.
**Mlehman**: Into September.
**Mlehman**: Mid end of September.
**Lydia**: Oh, boy.
**Lhoran**: It was really hoping for a hand.
**Bclymer**: I wasn't.
**Bclymer**: I was gonna be.
**Bclymer**: I was gonna be shocked if it was gonna be.
**Bclymer**: At least it's not 26.
**Lhoran**: I know.
**Bclymer**: I'm like, we work in this industry.
**Bclymer**: Come on now.
**Bclymer**: How many do you have that actually moves on time?
**Lhoran**: Well, we were doubled out to get rid of people on this wall.
**Lhoran**: And so.
**Lhoran**: And we have more people coming.
**Lhoran**: We're really bursting at the seams here.
**Lhoran**: So if there's anything you can do to reduce that duration or even open up, you know, a portion.
**Lhoran**: A portion.
**Lhoran**: Even open up that portion.
**Lhoran**: Right.
**Lhoran**: Issue.
**Lhoran**: Just those four back is really big.
**Lhoran**: But I can fill out every.
**Lhoran**: All of these right now.
**Lhoran**: All but one.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Lhoran**: The amount of people that will be here at the end of the summer.
**Mlehman**: We'll put our heads together, see if we can't phase something to make it work for you.
**Lhoran**: Yeah.
**Lhoran**: Anything creative to.
**Lhoran**: To.
**Lhoran**: We're just.
**Lhoran**: Like I said, it's.
**Lhoran**: It's hard to put two engineers in cubes.
**Lhoran**: They don't like to work together.
**Lydia**: These would just be a little bit.
**Bclymer**: So that's these four, Right.
**Lydia**: Because the data is there, the power is there.
**Mlehman**: It's about to play.
**Lhoran**: Yeah.
**Lhoran**: That's why those four would be you.
**Mlehman**: That's why I like the idea of being able to find.
**Mlehman**: Fill in.
**Mlehman**: We'll just fill in these areas and then.
**Mlehman**: I don't see why they can't be using those now.
**Lhoran**: Oh, I see.
**Lydia**: I.
**Mlehman**: Because that.
**Mlehman**: That hallway demo, we just throw up.
**Bclymer**: A plastic sheet then for a day or two again.
**Bclymer**: You know, I guess I'm good with filling in.
**Bclymer**: That makes sense.
**Bclymer**: But then when that f.
**Bclymer**: That wall finally comes down, is that a weekend or is that like, how do we keep all the t.
**Bclymer**: For that lift.
**Lydia**: House to do that group Saturday or.
**Mlehman**: We'Re just gonna have to be.
**Mlehman**: Yeah.
**Mlehman**: Very diligent to have everything done on this side of it prior and then come in on a Saturday.
**Mlehman**: I'm not sure it's gonna be one Saturday or two Saturdays or.
**Mlehman**: Or what that will look like.
**Lhoran**: Could be Saturday, Sunday or whatever.
**Lhoran**: Just to get the pain.
**Bclymer**: I guess that's more expensive to do it that way versus just putting up temporary wall and you have to do your whole Thing all the way through.
**Lydia**: You probably give us the.
**Lhoran**: Oh, good point.
**Bclymer**: I mean everything's got.
**Bclymer**: If the answers are supposed difference, that's fine.
**Bclymer**: My gut says there's going to be because you got to bring a demo crew back in and now you're.
**Bclymer**: You're piecemealing a part of it versus doing the whole thing all at once.
**Bclymer**: You gotta paint.
**Mlehman**: I'll get with the guys.
**Mlehman**: We'll.
**Mlehman**: We'll come up with a plan.
**Lhoran**: Yeah.
**Mlehman**: My goal is to be.
**Mlehman**: Is for you to be able to use those four.
**Lhoran**: Okay, that's great.
**Lhoran**: That really would.
**Lhoran**: Would take a lot of pressure off us.
**Lhoran**: So Appreciate that.
**Lydia**: I mean even if they just had a smaller walk space to walk through there, I don't know.
**Lydia**: I don't know how.
**Mlehman**: How close far away from it will be.
**Mlehman**: We'll go look at it.
**Lhoran**: Yeah.
**Lhoran**: Yeah.
**Lydia**: Okay.
**Lhoran**: That sounds.
**Mlehman**: I think it was going to be pretty tight to put a tank wallow.
**Mlehman**: You're okay with sliding in sideways maybe.
**Lhoran**: I made their move.
**Lhoran**: So, you know, if you need the whole, the whole space, you can do that.
**Lhoran**: But I mean I, I kind of like the infill because the sound area that these walls already made.
**Lhoran**: If you did do a temporary wall, maybe leave these up to last just because it's additional sound barrier.
**Lhoran**: That's all.
**Lhoran**: But you guys work through that and see what you think is best for the project.
**Mlehman**: Yeah.
**Mlehman**: I mean what I'm going to instruct the guys to do is to demo all of this early in the morning.
**Lydia**: Okay.
**Mlehman**: And then as it gets to be 8:30, 9:00 clock, go over to this side.
**Lhoran**: That's great.
**Lhoran**: And we can bother other people.
**Lydia**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I think that conference room here, I don't know how often they use it.
**Bclymer**: I can corner.
**Bclymer**: Kristen says they don't use that often.
**Lydia**: No.
**Bclymer**: So it needs to be one of those.
**Bclymer**: Just look in, it's not being used.
**Bclymer**: And then there's a whole other big gap before you're involved with anybody else.
**Lhoran**: Yeah.
**Mlehman**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Well, it's where we had our jamified thing.
**Lhoran**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: They're in the building.
**Bclymer**: Sorry.
**Bclymer**: Oh, they're not.
**Lydia**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: It's a large conference room that they.
**Lydia**: Okay.
**Lydia**: They.
**Bclymer**: I don't know.
**Bclymer**: So they don't use that often.
**Mlehman**: So before we start, you know, me and my super, we walk around and my card out that way, people call us first.
**Mlehman**: Before they start potentially complaining about noise.
**Mlehman**: Make sure they know, hey, this is happening.
**Mlehman**: Here's a schedule.
**Lydia**: I'm sure that I don't know what's below us where you want to do your milk through.
**Lydia**: But that'll be.
**Bclymer**: It's our room.
**Bclymer**: That's that large break room.
**Mlehman**: I think it's R D group.
**Bclymer**: Below where the Coke machine.
**Bclymer**: Well, I don't.
**Bclymer**: Maybe it doesn't extend that far out.
**Bclymer**: But I mean the main entrance is here in that break room.
**Lhoran**: But that's on first.
**Lydia**: The second floor is the.
**Mlehman**: Oh, that's right.
**Lydia**: We're on third floor.
**Lhoran**: Yeah, that's right.
**Lhoran**: But we can investigate that and go to second too.
**Lhoran**: And if you want to.
**Lhoran**: Do you know who you're going to use for your mechanical contractor?
**Mlehman**: Right now we have Dean doing electrical.
**Lydia**: Okay.
**Mlehman**: We haven't made a decision if they're going to do the H VAC or not.
**Mlehman**: Yeah.
**Mlehman**: So we're going to wait on.
**Mlehman**: On some pricing and make sure we get the best price for you.
**Lhoran**: I appreciate that.
**Lhoran**: Yeah.
**Mlehman**: I was just curious, but Dean will definitely be in here during the election.
**Lydia**: Okay.
**Lydia**: Just wondering about getting our data to that Coke through and where we would.
**Mlehman**: This one.
**Bclymer**: Last page.
**Mlehman**: So right now the way I understood it is we'll.
**Mlehman**: We'll run a conduit for you guys from here and it'll go underneath and poke up through here.
**Lydia**: Correct.
**Bclymer**: And there'll be another one in the wall.
**Mlehman**: Okay.
**Lydia**: There it would come up there and go up and.
**Lydia**: Okay, that makes sense.
**Mlehman**: Yeah, that makes sense.
**Lydia**: Yeah.
**Lydia**: So it'll be a 2 inch conduit over there along with the power.
**Mlehman**: This will be the only place where we have to core.
**Mlehman**: So we'll do one core and.
**Mlehman**: Okay, we'll do all the investigation on what's below.
**Lydia**: Yeah.
**Lydia**: Okay.
**Lhoran**: And we'll get this revised today.
**Lydia**: That.
**Lydia**: Yeah.
**Lydia**: All right, what else?
**Lhoran**: Cover the scope of the beta telecom.
**Lhoran**: Is there any.
**Lydia**: I think as they.
**Mlehman**: Do the wall.
**Lydia**: Just in the blocking and the boxes behind that.
**Lydia**: We just want to kind of have a little coordination of point that all happens so that we can have boxes that are accessible, not behind the supports and stuff like that just so makes.
**Lydia**: Makes it easy to work with.
**Mlehman**: It's great.
**Mlehman**: Our.
**Mlehman**: Our office is five minutes from here.
**Mlehman**: Yeah, just sounds good.
**Lydia**: Okay, that's great.
**Mlehman**: I'll be.
**Mlehman**: I'll be around a lot.
**Mlehman**: We'll have Alex here on side managing the guys bouncing back and forth.
**Mlehman**: Brandon, do you have anything?
**Mlehman**: Lydia, Parallel team.
**Lydia**: What about if we end up going with the alternate replacement with the AV boxes?
**Lydia**: All that work, how that fits in.
**Lhoran**: Good point.
**Lhoran**: That's a whole different discussion in there.
**Lhoran**: If we end up doing all new boxes, you're going to be very much invading.
**Lhoran**: Right.
**Lhoran**: Our workspace I mean how do you want to.
**Lydia**: Want to price that?
**Lydia**: Because do we.
**Lydia**: Yeah.
**Lydia**: After hours and Saturday work or how do you.
**Lydia**: Because that'll make a difference.
**Lydia**: And how long are they priced at and how big are these things?
**Lydia**: Do they have to take down.
**Lydia**: Can they get it through opening or.
**Bclymer**: You have to like, I don't know, tear up.
**Mlehman**: Yeah, you can.
**Mlehman**: Should be able to get them through these.
**Lydia**: Okay.
**Lhoran**: We have to.
**Bclymer**: I guess you.
**Bclymer**: The main's this way.
**Bclymer**: So as long as you have to remove two, two Couple T bars we.
**Mlehman**: Have to take out.
**Mlehman**: Yeah, we definitely can fit it in a 4x4 by.
**Bclymer**: But you're just.
**Bclymer**: Again, this T bar is just sitting.
**Lydia**: There between the two or something.
**Lydia**: Yeah, yeah.
**Lydia**: But anyway that's.
**Lydia**: I mean you can see where they're at.
**Lydia**: Conference room.
**Mlehman**: The office.
**Ataylor**: Office.
**Mlehman**: So these are nice because you can just whoever's in that office.
**Mlehman**: Hey, today if you don't mind, work from home or.
**Lhoran**: Exactly.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Mlehman**: So 1, 2, 3.
**Lydia**: You've got this out in the open space.
**Lydia**: This out in the open space.
**Lydia**: This is really messed up.
**Lydia**: I don't know how it's over the top but.
**Mlehman**: Well, I, I.
**Mlehman**: Hopefully that ball doesn't go through the ceiling.
**Lhoran**: That's probably what it is.
**Lydia**: And then here's an open space.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, most of wall stuff.
**Lydia**: So yeah, it's a mixed bag.
**Lydia**: You get some out in the open space.
**Bclymer**: The offices.
**Mlehman**: Well, let's.
**Mlehman**: We'll price it and then we'll put a plan together and if it figures to be too invasive after looking at it, we can give you an alternate for.
**Mlehman**: You know, we'll do these four on a Saturday.
**Lhoran**: I think that's a good way to do it.
**Lhoran**: I mean I, I think you can do these if you just give us a day notice.
**Lydia**: We'll.
**Lydia**: We'll just call all the office people.
**Lydia**: But.
**Lhoran**: Definitely one, two, six that are out in the space.
**Lhoran**: Seven where we might just say we give you four or five days or something.
**Mlehman**: Yeah.
**Lhoran**: Everybody works for all up here.
**Lydia**: I don't want to.
**Lhoran**: So let's plan on that being occurring during normal hours I guess and we'll just, we'll just work from home.
**Mlehman**: Okay.
**Lhoran**: Would be another.
**Lydia**: I think we can shut it down but depends on how many days of work you're going to do in there with countertops and then it'll work.
**Lhoran**: Probably using a week in there or something.
**Lydia**: Yeah.
**Lhoran**: Be about a week.
**Lydia**: A week to two weeks.
**Lydia**: I'm trying to give or take.
**Mlehman**: It's my understanding this is, this is an alternate working here.
**Lhoran**: Except for that box.
**Lhoran**: That will still happen.
**Lhoran**: Either base bin, lose controls or alternate.
**Lhoran**: It'll be in box.
**Lhoran**: And that's.
**Lhoran**: That doesn't fall into an alternate.
**Lhoran**: All the.
**Lhoran**: All the vavices are getting upgraded, whether it's controls only or replacement.
**Lydia**: Right.
**Lydia**: I sent you contact.
**Lydia**: Very responsive.
**Lydia**: So awesome.
**Lhoran**: Anybody online have any other additional comments?
**Ataylor**: I know there was a.
**Ataylor**: I think a comment about biweekly meetings or if we wanted to get those set up now that everyone's in one room.
**Ataylor**: I didn't see them planned on the calendar now, so I wanted to see if that's something that we wanted to get scheduled while we're all together.
**Lydia**: Yeah.
**Lhoran**: Yeah, let's do.
**Ataylor**: Typically we see the.
**Ataylor**: If it's AJ Or Brandon, construction project manager, to lead those and just have weekly construction or bi weekly construction updates.
**Ataylor**: And then we can chime in on anything related to issues with submittals.
**Ataylor**: But it's a smaller team and you know, you can add your subs or vendors to that if you'd like.
**Ataylor**: But I'll kind of let you all start with your availability.
**Ataylor**: Parallel parallels.
**Ataylor**: Best times are Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, typically those weekdays.
**Ataylor**: But if we need to do it on an alternate day, we can make something available.
**Lhoran**: Mondays are often a good day for us because we go on surveys during the core part of the week.
**Lhoran**: Typically.
**Lydia**: But.
**Lhoran**: Yeah, like early afternoon on Monday.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, we have a.
**Ataylor**: We have availability after typically noon or one.
**Ataylor**: So free.
**Lhoran**: Okay.
**Lhoran**: How does two look for you guys on Mondays?
**Lydia**: Typically?
**Lydia**: That's fine.
**Mlehman**: Two weeks for me.
**Lhoran**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Aj, when do you want to start?
**Lhoran**: I gotta go a little later.
**Lhoran**: I'm gonna mess the first three.
**Mlehman**: You really want to be at that if you're here?
**Lhoran**: I don't need to be here last either.
**Bclymer**: One.
**Lhoran**: One of.
**Lhoran**: One of us three needs to be here, so.
**Lhoran**: But yeah, generally that's a day that.
**Lydia**: I don't have something in me.
**Lydia**: Okay, let's.
**Lhoran**: Let's just stick with that.
**Lhoran**: As long as you was a border here.
**Mlehman**: Two on two on Mondays.
**Lydia**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: Do you want to host that meeting or send it out on your side in case you need to alter the dates or anything that it's.
**Mlehman**: Yeah, I can shoot one out for.
**Mlehman**: For a weekly.
**Bclymer**: We'll start.
**Mlehman**: We can start next week.
**Mlehman**: May not have a ton to report, but I would say we start the following week.
**Lhoran**: Yeah.
**Mlehman**: That way we'll have the pricing in.
**Bclymer**: And we can.
**Mlehman**: Correct.
**Ataylor**: I think the following week is Memorial Day.
**Lhoran**: That's true.
**Lhoran**: You want to do that one as a Tuesday, then I'm okay with that.
**Lhoran**: So 26 yeah.
**Lhoran**: So that would be Tuesday.
**Bclymer**: Probably be able to start before the 20th.
**Bclymer**: I mean, gonna be honest, it's gonna be two weeks.
**Bclymer**: I don't.
**Bclymer**: I would be shocked if you're mobile.
**Mlehman**: If we have to have just a.
**Mlehman**: Find a time to meet after we send you the pricing.
**Lhoran**: We didn't make that phone call, you.
**Mlehman**: Know, I'll have it start June 2nd.
**Lhoran**: June 2nd sounds good.
**Bclymer**: That's where I was.
**Mlehman**: And then I'll include everyone who's on this thread.
**Lydia**: If you can start for June, that's great.
**Bclymer**: But I'm trying to be logical here where I doubt that.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I'll have to get pricing, plus people line up to do the work.
**Mlehman**: We'll want to have a conversation before we mobilize.
**Mlehman**: For sure.
**Mlehman**: Just logistically, that gives me time to get with the landlord, start getting the money.
**Lydia**: Maybe just give us feedback on what the landlord says about, you know, their cooperation with trying to get stuff through the window and all that.
**Lydia**: We're very curious about.
**Lydia**: Yeah.
**Lhoran**: Well, worth working with you or not.
**Lydia**: Yeah.
**Mlehman**: Yeah.
**Mlehman**: I'm happy to include you guys with this.
**Mlehman**: I mean, I.
**Mlehman**: I will handle.
**Mlehman**: Yeah, so you don't have to handle it, but I'll.
**Mlehman**: I'll keep you.
**Lydia**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: And then AJ if you want to set those up to be teams meetings and then if we need to make some on site to review other things, you know, we can handle that as.
**Ataylor**: As the project progresses.
**Ataylor**: If you think that's best case scenario.
**Lydia**: Might not have a place to meet.
**Mlehman**: We'll definitely want to do like.
**Lydia**: We'll figure it out.
**Mlehman**: We'll definitely.
**Mlehman**: I mean, like I said, I'll be here, Alex will be here.
**Mlehman**: I'm sure you guys will be here.
**Mlehman**: So we can plan on meeting on site if we want to and then.
**Mlehman**: But yeah, I'll set it up as a teams meeting just because everybody's busy.
**Lydia**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: So are you going to do those weekly or bi weekly?
**Mlehman**: Aj, I like to do weekly meetings.
**Ataylor**: Okay, that's fine.
**Ataylor**: I was just checking.
**Ataylor**: Not a problem.
**Lhoran**: The last thing I think of.
**Lhoran**: Can you put a schedule together with your proposal and show us what you.
**Lhoran**: Your best guess what this whole thing looks like.
**Lhoran**: I'd like to share with all the guys out there.
**Lydia**: They're going to be listening to the noise for the next few.
**Lhoran**: Yeah, just keep them updated where things are at.
**Lhoran**: It's been a long time coming, us getting started on this for sure.
**Mlehman**: Yeah, I understand.
**Lydia**: All right.
**Lhoran**: Anything else?
**Ataylor**: Nothing on our side.
**Ataylor**: We'll just wait to access submittals.
**Ataylor**: Do you all use Portal?
**Ataylor**: Or procore or assistant or are those just coming over email?
**Mlehman**: We.
**Mlehman**: We have job planner.
**Ataylor**: Okay, that's fine.
**Mlehman**: We'll get everybody added and okay, you can see a schedule in there as well.
**Mlehman**: So update it weekly.
**Lhoran**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Applied.
**Ataylor**: Would you also like to review submittals or are you going to rely on us are parallel to handle those.
**Ataylor**: We can stamp them and then get them to you next order.
**Bclymer**: I think that's.
**Bclymer**: I think we're not option on someone like you're going to want to look at the bab boxes but I'm going to be honest with you.
**Bclymer**: Drywall's.
**Bclymer**: Drywall Paint.
**Bclymer**: Paint.
**Lhoran**: You know, skip a lot of it.
**Bclymer**: So I guess an option and maybe it's easier to send them all to us if we just say don't need to review.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I don't want us to hold you up.
**Bclymer**: But if it's something we don't know enough about or we can't find any input, we'll just respond.
**Ataylor**: Well, yeah.
**Ataylor**: And I would say the things that are pretty standard for us, you know, we typically if it's something that a client needs to review, we.
**Ataylor**: We do that.
**Ataylor**: So just wanting to include you on a level that you're comfortable with so we can have the.
**Ataylor**: The progress for submittals or the process start with us and then if I feel like I need to be past, you know, you know that's something I can do.
**Ataylor**: And then because they do use that program, you'll be able to see all those as they're logged and pass through.
**Ataylor**: So of course if you have any questions, they would be there.
**Ataylor**: So happy to do that in whatever way and happy to be helpful and share things in the way that you prefer.
**Mlehman**: We'll make sure everything goes to them first.
**Lhoran**: Okay.
**Lydia**: And then yeah.
**Lhoran**: We have existing materials.
**Lhoran**: We have the exact carpet tile.
**Lhoran**: That's true.
**Mlehman**: I was going to ask you if.
**Lhoran**: You had added tabs so you can match it.
**Lhoran**: Were you able to find like the.
**Lhoran**: A picture of the carpet tile model number?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, it's the latest.
**Lhoran**: Was that that last email?
**Bclymer**: The last thing I sent had a picture.
**Bclymer**: You got a paint the carpet tile.
**Lhoran**: And so you can exactly match paint exactly if they're still in stock.
**Lhoran**: I mean if they're still made.
**Lhoran**: You know that.
**Bclymer**: Oh, that's.
**Bclymer**: I couldn't find out.
**Mlehman**: I'll have my flooring guy look into it.
**Lhoran**: Okay.
**Mlehman**: We'll plan on it.
**Mlehman**: They were matching that.
**Bclymer**: I don't remember.
**Bclymer**: I hit reply.
**Bclymer**: Also, if you were on the emails yesterday.
**Mlehman**: Yeah, I thought I saw.
**Lhoran**: Yeah.
**Mlehman**: So Tuesday or whatever.
**Lhoran**: We'll.
**Mlehman**: Yeah, we'll see.
**Mlehman**: I.
**Lhoran**: We'll have to look.
**Lhoran**: Yeah.
**Lhoran**: Yeah, let us know.
**Lhoran**: Otherwise they were able to find a pretty darn good match.
**Lhoran**: Just it's in there but it's not exactly right the behind the reception area where.
**Lhoran**: Where that applied sign is behind you it's got wallpaper.
**Lhoran**: You can see the color there under the light that we have some of that still quite a bit of that in stock.
**Mlehman**: Okay.
**Lhoran**: With parallel.
**Lhoran**: It's called out new material here where we're going to put the applied sign.
**Lhoran**: But that's the only thing it.
**Lhoran**: What kind of applied sign.
**Lhoran**: We have probably enough of that wall to.
**Lhoran**: To use that again.
**Mlehman**: So whatever.
**Lhoran**: Whatever you got, you know.
**Mlehman**: Yeah.
**Mlehman**: If we have enough then we might.
**Lhoran**: Have enough just for that.
**Lhoran**: But not enough for, you know, another wall.
**Lydia**: Whatever.
**Lhoran**: But.
**Mlehman**: Yeah.
**Mlehman**: And I'll get with the landlord on.
**Lydia**: What that's going to look like.
**Mlehman**: Hopefully they have extra.
**Mlehman**: I think there's wallpaper out there.
**Mlehman**: So I just want to make sure that they know outside the door.
**Lhoran**: I'll look them down.
**Lhoran**: Yeah we used an old base plan because the father's actually over here but David didn't have.
**Lhoran**: That's fine.
**Lydia**: I'll change that stuff.
**Lhoran**: Okay good.
**Lhoran**: Yeah, that sounds good.
**Lhoran**: So materials don't know if there's anything else.
**Lhoran**: When you put the cabinet condensing it on the roof.
**Lhoran**: I assume that we'll put a little equipment curve there and.
**Lydia**: Okay.
**Lhoran**: Disconnect needs to be there for code of your UCLA.
**Lydia**: Don'T have anything else for now.
**Lydia**: That's always.
**Lhoran**: We're going to send this to you via PDF but I'm updated.
**Lhoran**: You want to take it too but the PDF will be more up to date.
**Mlehman**: Yes.
**Lydia**: Perfect.
**Lydia**: Thank you.
**Mlehman**: Just fine.
**Lhoran**: All right.
**Mlehman**: Sweet.
**Mlehman**: Well I'm excited to get going on.
**Lhoran**: It'S too been a journey here.
**Mlehman**: It'll be great when.
**Lhoran**: Yeah, that'll be great.
**Lhoran**: Excited.
**Lhoran**: All right.
**Lhoran**: If nothing else online we'll adjourn.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Nothing compare.
**Ataylor**: Thank you guys.
**Lhoran**: Thank you.
**Mlehman**: Thank you.
**Ataylor**: Bye bye.
**Lydia**: I sent back.
