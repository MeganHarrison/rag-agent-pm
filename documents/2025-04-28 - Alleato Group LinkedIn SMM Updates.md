**Victoria**: Like, super, super rainy, so I didn't have much time to go out with my baby, but yesterday was a little bit of sunny, so we kind of, like, enjoy our time and.
**Victoria**: Yeah.
**Victoria**: You know, every time I have time with my baby is the best time for me, so.
**Victoria**: Yeah, that's good.
**Victoria**: Yeah.
**Victoria**: Indoor time is still time, but I have the sun better.
**Victoria**: Yeah.
**Victoria**: How are you?
**Victoria**: Did you get a great weekend?
**Victoria**: Yeah, my mom was in town, so that was really nice.
**Victoria**: The girls were good.
**Victoria**: And my.
**Victoria**: My husband was at, like, a addiction medicine conference because he didn't.
**Victoria**: So he was doing a thing.
**Victoria**: So it was a girls weekend.
**Victoria**: Let me text this guy.
**Victoria**: Where does Brandon.
**Victoria**: Yeah.
**Victoria**: And it's okay if we need to reschedule or you and I can just go over stuff.
**Victoria**: Okay.

**Victoria**: Oh, AJ is here.
**Victoria**: Let's see.
**Victoria**: Brandon.
**Victoria**: Hi, aj.
**Victoria**: Hey.
**Victoria**: Hey.
**Bclymer**: Sorry.
**Victoria**: Sneeze those allergies.
**Victoria**: He's joining Anika.
**Victoria**: Okay, great.
**Victoria**: Yeah, he was like, joining what?
**Victoria**: And I'm like, the mini.
**Victoria**: How is.
**Victoria**: How are you today, Brandon?
**Bclymer**: Same.
**Victoria**: Okay, we'll make this short and sweet so you can get in and get out.
**Victoria**: I hope you're starting to feel better and you get in real quick.
**Victoria**: Maria was telling me about what happened, so.
**Victoria**: Okay, so we're just going to go over the content calendar.
**Victoria**: We've already been over it a little bit.
**Victoria**: There you go.
**Victoria**: So the drone reels.
**Victoria**: One of the biggest things that we need is for the script to be revised for the drone reel so that everyone's on the same page and happy about how it sounds.
**Victoria**: If you want me to, like, take a crack at whatever AJ has already written and kind of rewrite it, but I know that you wanted to get in there.
**Bclymer**: I have it in a Word document right here.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, AJ was supposed to send me that.
**Bclymer**: It's in my chat gbt.
**Victoria**: So let me.
**Bclymer**: I'll download it and email it.
**Bclymer**: Did you already email it to me?
**Victoria**: No, I haven't yet.
**Victoria**: I forgot to.
**Victoria**: Okay.
**Victoria**: So, Brandon, whenever you have a chance to look at that, then we can get those.
**Victoria**: I can swap them around for whatever is our favorite so that the.
**Victoria**: The next one is, you know, if we don't have a chance to edit it by this.
**Victoria**: I think he said there was one that he liked.
**Victoria**: Yeah, we posted that one.
**Victoria**: Yeah, we posted.
**Victoria**: Yeah, but we can move them further out, too.
**Bclymer**: Aj, did you give Maria the information she needs for our Facebook?
**Victoria**: Did I, Maria?
**Victoria**: No.
**Victoria**: You forgot.
**Victoria**: I don't even.
**Bclymer**: I don't even know what the.
**Victoria**: I think it's.
**Victoria**: I added you a notion, though.
**Victoria**: If you can send it, like, as a task.
**Victoria**: It's not that with Facebook, you just add a person to it.
**Bclymer**: Maria.
**Victoria**: So I'll just add you to the page?
**Victoria**: Yeah, if you can add me as a role, like an admin, I'll do it right now.
**Victoria**: I'll take it from.
**Victoria**: Yes, I'll take it from there.
**Bclymer**: I'll add you as a friend and.
**Victoria**: Then I'll add you to the page because.
**Victoria**: Sounds good.
**Bclymer**: It's not.
**Victoria**: It's not held by you.
**Victoria**: Don't log in on an email or anything on it.
**Victoria**: Okay, let me know I remember my Facebook password.
**Bclymer**: I'll do it while we're going here.
**Victoria**: Okay, perfect.
**Victoria**: Okay, I'm going to scroll down to the bottom so we can look at these as we go.
**Victoria**: The drone reels will go over.
**Victoria**: This is a possible CEO quote.
**Victoria**: Share this tab instead.
**Victoria**: And then.
**Victoria**: Oops.
**Victoria**: There we go.
**Victoria**: Here's one of them.
**Victoria**: This is a daily motivation.
**Victoria**: I think this is actually the end of the month.
**Victoria**: So this is just a Brandon type quote.
**Victoria**: That would just be a very simple Alito friendly thing for the end of the month.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I would say the only thing with that quote is, like, that's good.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: There's copy below it.
**Bclymer**: I see.
**Victoria**: Yes.
**Victoria**: So it kind of puts it in context.
**Victoria**: How does that look?
**Bclymer**: So I would say, like at the bottom it says when challenges hit, comma.
**Bclymer**: I would say something like, challenges are inevitable.
**Bclymer**: A winning team adapts and overcomes to get to the finish line.
**Bclymer**: Something like that.
**Bclymer**: Or adapts and overcomes to achieve the desired outcome or something like that.
**Bclymer**: Instead of saying the winning team, say a winning team.
**Victoria**: Okay, I like how that looks.
**Victoria**: Yeah, I like how that looks.
**Victoria**: Okay, let's do.
**Victoria**: So a couple of these.
**Victoria**: We need.
**Victoria**: We need a lot of pictures.
**Victoria**: So the.
**Victoria**: Here, I'll go back to the agenda because this is really where we get.
**Victoria**: I know.
**Victoria**: Goodwill Bar and Aspire Health.
**Victoria**: Maria, you made a note to reach out to the project managers.
**Victoria**: I know.
**Victoria**: I saw your email that mentions that we're going to start getting a lot more content from them, which is amazing.
**Victoria**: You mean for the photos?
**Victoria**: Yeah, for Goodwill bars and Aspire Health.
**Victoria**: So Aspire Health.
**Victoria**: So I mean, they have like all photos from 2024.
**Victoria**: I went through those and they are.
**Victoria**: Okay.
**Victoria**: They're not the greatest, but I can share them with you if you want to see them, because they're not going back to that project.
**Victoria**: So I can share it with you.
**Victoria**: And then for Goodwill Bard, this is Alex.
**Victoria**: He said he.
**Victoria**: So he talked to me on Friday and everything looks beautiful, but the thing is that everybody was just, like doing changes and everything.
**Victoria**: So he looks a lot of cardboard around.
**Victoria**: So he said they're going back then today or tomorrow.
**Victoria**: So he will send me a nice video.
**Victoria**: And I actually asked for a testimonial.
**Victoria**: So I asked if he can ask somebody for, you know, the questions that we usually have.
**Victoria**: So he said he will.
**Victoria**: So.
**Victoria**: So he's going to get us the testimonial from someone and then he's going to get us the nice pictures and videos.
**Victoria**: Who did.
**Bclymer**: Who did you talk to about that Friday?
**Bclymer**: Who did you talk to when.
**Bclymer**: Who did you talk to?
**Victoria**: Alex.
**Bclymer**: Alex.
**Bclymer**: Alex is not on Aspire Health.
**Victoria**: No, no.
**Victoria**: Alex is Goodwill, Bart, Aspire Health.
**Victoria**: They're not going back.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so a testimonial for Aspire Health or a testimonial for.
**Victoria**: So for Aspire Health.
**Victoria**: Nobody's going back to the project.
**Victoria**: Like Aspire Health is closed right now.
**Victoria**: So what they.
**Victoria**: What I'm going to do and guys just send you.
**Bclymer**: So what we need to do for the testimonial is the same thing we did last time, where we type it up and send it to them for their blessing.
**Victoria**: So this one is not the testimonial quote.
**Victoria**: These ones are questions related of how did you.
**Victoria**: Why did you do the project?
**Victoria**: How do you feel with Alo?
**Victoria**: Why Alito?
**Victoria**: So it's different.
**Bclymer**: It's like an exit interview.
**Victoria**: Is that what it is?
**Victoria**: Yes, it's like a little interview.
**Victoria**: It's just five questions.
**Victoria**: So I ask Alex if he can ask somebody those questions and for testimonial, if they have like a nice phrase from there, we can use it.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I get same thing for the questions.
**Bclymer**: Like, I don't know who he's going to ask.
**Bclymer**: But if we say, if we go ahead and answer them how we want them to be answered and then we send it to them, be okay, we want to, you know, we want to post this.
**Bclymer**: Do you agree with these answers?
**Bclymer**: Is there anything you want to change that's going to be way better?
**Bclymer**: Because it says what we want to say and it takes all the work out of them.
**Bclymer**: So they don't have to do anything but just say, yep, looks good.
**Victoria**: Yes.
**Victoria**: But some things are, for example, their personal things, like why did you.
**Victoria**: I mean, I think it was related to what.
**Bclymer**: Pull up the questions and I'll answer them.
**Victoria**: So I mean, something you gotta tailor.
**Victoria**: We can give them bullet points.
**Victoria**: But you want them.
**Victoria**: Yeah, we can give them bullet points.
**Victoria**: Because a lot of people don't want.
**Bclymer**: To take it like, oh, yeah, that sounds right.
**Bclymer**: But you want them to be able to change it.
**Bclymer**: I mean, that's because then they can't change for everybody.
**Victoria**: Okay, so the first one, I just.
**Bclymer**: Want to say we again, like, so you have to understand, when I sent that to Jared the first time, he literally responded, he goes, you know me so well.
**Bclymer**: Thank you for doing this.
**Bclymer**: Like, I know these.
**Bclymer**: We should leave it up for each exit interview.
**Victoria**: Maybe leave it up to the PM.
**Bclymer**: Or whoever is the account manager.
**Bclymer**: So for Brandon, that'd be like his clients, like tailor it to.
**Victoria**: Towards what we think they would say and then go, yeah.
**Victoria**: So for example, this question is more like, why did you decided to decide a little for your project?
**Victoria**: Um, so what was the problem?
**Victoria**: That.
**Victoria**: Not the problem, but why.
**Victoria**: For example, they wanted to do with Woolweel Bart.
**Victoria**: So it was like an expansion.
**Victoria**: It was something new.
**Victoria**: It was so that, for example, the.
**Bclymer**: Question is why did you decide to go with Alito for this project?
**Bclymer**: Correct.
**Victoria**: So correct.
**Victoria**: How.
**Victoria**: And then how has your experience been working with Alito Group?
**Bclymer**: Let me answer the first one.
**Bclymer**: So Alito Group, the reason we went to Alito Group is because they literally fight our battles for us and we can't ask for anything more in a valued partner.
**Victoria**: Okay, so I'll.
**Victoria**: I'll Draft these ones and then I'll send them to you because there are six different questions.
**Victoria**: And then I can send them also to Alex just to see if he wants to add something from his project so we can have him.
**Victoria**: And then just.
**Victoria**: Just send them as an email.
**Bclymer**: You can send them to me.
**Bclymer**: Here's the thing.
**Bclymer**: Alex hasn't been there a lot and doesn't know what's going on when he is there.
**Bclymer**: So I don't trust him to answer these questions and I don't trust him to ask the client in the right way.
**Victoria**: Okay, sounds good.
**Victoria**: I'll send that to you.
**Victoria**: I want to answer all of these questions right now over, like, live.
**Victoria**: And just have me jot them down.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, ask them.
**Bclymer**: Ask each question.
**Bclymer**: I'll answer it, and if I don't know, we'll go back to it.
**Victoria**: Okay, so let me send them to you.
**Bclymer**: I had my volume on full blast.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Not anymore.
**Victoria**: Hey, Maria, I'm trying to find you on Facebook.
**Victoria**: I just realized I don't have Facebook.
**Victoria**: I can.
**Victoria**: I can try to download it again.
**Victoria**: You just want to make, like, a fake one.
**Bclymer**: But, like, I created the page through.
**Victoria**: My Facebook and so there's no, like, actual login.
**Victoria**: And then I can just make you an account.
**Victoria**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Add you to the page.
**Bclymer**: Like I added Brandon.
**Bclymer**: Brandon, I think you're added on the page too.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: So question two.
**Bclymer**: How was your experience?
**Bclymer**: How has your experience been working with the Lido group on this project?
**Bclymer**: What stood out to you about the process?
**Bclymer**: Okay, so how has your experience been working with our experience?
**Bclymer**: Working with Alito Group on this project has been above and beyond expectations.
**Bclymer**: They are able to be proactive, get things done on time and on budget.
**Bclymer**: What stood out to you most about this process?
**Bclymer**: The fact that we can do a project and finish with no change orders is astounding.
**Bclymer**: And we are so grateful for Alito Group to having the upfront thinking to get a complete design and construction so that we know our budget before the project starts.
**Bclymer**: Question 3.
**Bclymer**: What aspects of the project are you most proud of or excited about?
**Bclymer**: We're excited to bring a great learning environment to Bartholomew county and to serve the local population.
**Bclymer**: How do you feel about the final results?
**Bclymer**: What impact do you believe this project will have on your business or the community?
**Bclymer**: So we couldn't be more happy with the product.
**Bclymer**: Alito group overcame any and all challenges, no matter what it was, to get us done on budget and on time so that we can serve the community.
**Bclymer**: The impact this project will have.
**Bclymer**: The community is More than can be seen right now.
**Bclymer**: This educating youth in this community will pay dividends for generations.
**Victoria**: Is there two more?
**Bclymer**: That's all there was.
**Victoria**: Oh, just four.
**Victoria**: Okay, great.
**Victoria**: Another five.
**Victoria**: So wait.
**Victoria**: One, two, three, four, five.
**Victoria**: The first one is why inspired this project and what were your main goals when you decided to move forward with it?
**Victoria**: With it.
**Victoria**: That's number one.
**Victoria**: And then I think you did already.
**Victoria**: The other ones.
**Bclymer**: What?
**Victoria**: I don't think we talked about the main goals.
**Bclymer**: What inspired this project and what were your main goals with when you decided to move forward with it?
**Bclymer**: I thought I answered that one first.
**Victoria**: I have written down why, Alito, they fight our battles for us and we can't ask for anything more to value partner.
**Victoria**: But I don't have goals.
**Bclymer**: All right, so what inspired this project and what were your main goals when you decided to move forward with it?
**Bclymer**: So the main goals for this project was to serve a needed population through our Excel centers.
**Bclymer**: Our goal was to get this building up and running in time to serve a full school class for the 2025 mid year semester or mid year term.
**Victoria**: Okay, perfect.
**Victoria**: Okay, I'll check back with the transcript for these and get those verbatim.
**Victoria**: But I made some notes and then so I'll.
**Victoria**: I will copy these ones from your comments.
**Victoria**: Annika.
**Victoria**: I know also from Fireflies here.
**Victoria**: That's fine.
**Victoria**: And then I will send this.
**Victoria**: But who is the person from Goodwill Bar?
**Victoria**: I mean, Alex.
**Victoria**: I mean, I need to.
**Victoria**: So who's gonna send it?
**Victoria**: So.
**Bclymer**: So what we'll do is Maria.
**Bclymer**: So take it and make the nice PDF with the questions and answers and then also have like the questions and our answers in a word doc or something that they can change.
**Bclymer**: And so you'll send it to Jared and Lakisha and cc, myself and Jesse and just say, hey guys, you know, we wanted.
**Bclymer**: We had some marketing questions.
**Bclymer**: We went ahead and preemptively filled some of these out.
**Bclymer**: However, if you want to change anything or you want to scrap it all, feel free.
**Bclymer**: Here's the Word document.
**Bclymer**: If you could, you know, please let us know.
**Victoria**: Okay.
**Victoria**: I'll confirm with you the emails before sending them.
**Victoria**: Okay.
**Victoria**: Okay, great.
**Victoria**: I'm going to come back to this tab here.
**Victoria**: So I moved this one up so that it's the first of the month or not the first month, the sixth of the month.
**Victoria**: So that it's right front and center.
**Victoria**: Westfield Collective feature I have on here and believe.
**Victoria**: I have to remind myself, I believe that we're looking for more content here.
**Victoria**: Or is this Repurposing.
**Bclymer**: So remember, I.
**Bclymer**: I would think we're doing more stuff with the groundbreaking, but I don't know the.
**Bclymer**: Did you get the new drone videos, Maria, From Chad, because he took some of Westfield.
**Bclymer**: We need to get those and incorporate those into the drone video.
**Bclymer**: So we're not watching.
**Bclymer**: Looking at the same thing.
**Victoria**: Yep.
**Victoria**: So I'll send that to you.
**Victoria**: Let me.
**Victoria**: Actually, he's here.
**Victoria**: Maria, I have.
**Victoria**: I have some too.
**Victoria**: When I was showing them how to do it that are actually.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, so let me.
**Bclymer**: They're on my phone now.
**Bclymer**: I'll upload them into a one drive.
**Victoria**: Okay.
**Victoria**: Thank you.
**Victoria**: And.
**Victoria**: Yeah, and if you can send me the link so I can use chats as well.
**Victoria**: So add to those.
**Victoria**: Sorry.
**Victoria**: My daughter's very excited.
**Victoria**: Brandon.
**Victoria**: No, he just sent it to me over teams, so it's fine.
**Victoria**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: I'll put it.
**Victoria**: I'll add chats.
**Victoria**: Okay.
**Victoria**: To your.
**Victoria**: To your drive.
**Victoria**: Thank you.
**Victoria**: And then I'll share it with Annika.
**Victoria**: Thank you.
**Victoria**: Making a note.
**Victoria**: This is on our agenda as well.
**Victoria**: Okay.
**Victoria**: So the next one is the zone of genius, which we have all worked out here for copy believe.
**Victoria**: And then the other graphics we have to go over is, like underneath the team section because it was goodwill, Bart, and then another drone.
**Bclymer**: The.
**Victoria**: The infographic on time and money is progress.
**Victoria**: And then here's the week of team.
**Victoria**: So I'd like to add more people to this if we can get some head.
**Victoria**: More headshots.
**Victoria**: These are the three people that I have headshots for.
**Victoria**: So we got Brandon, AJ And Maria.
**Victoria**: Is there anyone else that you would like to add to this?
**Bclymer**: I forgot Maria can.
**Bclymer**: Can get them.
**Bclymer**: I mean, we have a bunch of different people, so.
**Victoria**: Beautiful.
**Victoria**: All right, Maria, I'll connect with you on that because we only have headshots for Jesse and then not the other people.
**Victoria**: I mean, they have it on the signature, so.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Victoria**: I mean, I lost everybody.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, we'll have to make do with what we got.
**Victoria**: Yeah.
**Victoria**: Even, like, LinkedIn photos work well too.
**Victoria**: Like Maria's.
**Victoria**: Yours.
**Victoria**: Yeah, some of them are.
**Victoria**: Yeah, I'll check.
**Victoria**: I'll ask everybody worry.
**Victoria**: I'll send you a link with everything.
**Victoria**: Okay, perfect.
**Victoria**: Getting into kind of end of May.
**Victoria**: This is a post the challenges for entrepreneurs video, which is.
**Victoria**: Well, from the Instagram Reels folder, which is from before.
**Victoria**: We can look over the copy really fast.
**Victoria**: Letting go is weakness is growth.
**Victoria**: Our CEO Brandon chooses the hardest mindset for any former.
**Victoria**: Realizing you can't scale by doing it all yourself.
**Victoria**: Building a strong team means accepting progress over perfection.
**Victoria**: And that's how real growth happens.
**Bclymer**: We're seeing Maria's headshot.
**Victoria**: Oh, sorry, I just forgot to click the other tab.
**Victoria**: That's this one that I just read out.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, it's fine.
**Victoria**: Okay, great.
**Victoria**: And then this is the why we built.
**Victoria**: So one of the things we talked about last time was getting videos of people talking about.
**Victoria**: About why we build for each of people's individual preferences.
**Victoria**: Right.
**Victoria**: So if we go back to the agenda, that's one of the things we need.
**Victoria**: So anyone who wants to create the why we build video, we can also turn this into a graphic and do quotes if we people can't get on camera.
**Victoria**: Depends on how inundated people are.
**Victoria**: But it would be great to do like I build because I love creating new meaningful spaces for people to enjoy.
**Victoria**: Shadris lynch little more authenticity.
**Victoria**: So if possible, would we.
**Victoria**: Could we do videos or do you think that's not quite feasible this month?
**Bclymer**: I think we can do videos.
**Victoria**: Great.
**Victoria**: Okay.
**Victoria**: I will send a lot of.
**Victoria**: These are kind of reminders of what we need from, you know, photos and videos in order to really finish up and round out this main content.
**Victoria**: So that's pretty much.
**Victoria**: I think we can kind of end there because we've got the beginning ones approved except for the drone videos for the first of the month.
**Victoria**: For the first week of the month.
**Victoria**: And then I'll stay in contact and really get everything else finalized so that by our next meeting we can have all of that content in there and have it really finalized for the month.
**Bclymer**: All right, sounds good.
**Victoria**: Okay, Anything else to chat about before we end today?
**Bclymer**: That's it.
**Victoria**: Okay.
**Victoria**: Feel better, Brandon, and thank you all for joining and have a great Monday.
**Bclymer**: Thank you.
**Victoria**: See you, Anika.
**Victoria**: I'll send you everything.
**Victoria**: I'll send you the links.
**Victoria**: Sure.
**Victoria**: With the headshots and what else was for me the.
**Victoria**: I'll send a reminder.
**Victoria**: But the.
**Victoria**: The Westfield or what?
**Victoria**: The Westfield drone videos.
**Victoria**: Maybe aj.
**Victoria**: Oh, well, that's With.
**Victoria**: With.
**Victoria**: So can you tag AJ and say like ag.
**Victoria**: If he can send the one drive link and then I'll add it to that one.
**Victoria**: So drum videos for aj.
**Victoria**: I'll send you the headshots and then I think that's me from my side.
**Victoria**: Right.
**Victoria**: Just the headshots.
**Victoria**: And then I'll send the questions that he did for Woodwill Bard and then I'll reply to them.
**Victoria**: So I'll gather him right now and then I'll CCU so you also can see them.
**Victoria**: Yeah, I'll send a follow up email that lists everything each person needs to deliver.
**Victoria**: Perfect.
**Victoria**: Okay.
**Victoria**: Thank you, Annika.
**Victoria**: Talk to you later.
**Victoria**: Bye.
