## Transcript
**Rachel.hasan**: Hello.
**Jdawson**: Hey, Rachel.
**Jdawson**: How are you?
**Rachel.hasan**: I'm good.
**Rachel.hasan**: I see that there's lots of people here on this meeting.
**Jdawson**: Just me and.
**Jdawson**: Me and my vp, Jesse Dawson.
**Jdawson**: And then you're muted.
**Jdawson**: Oh, am I muted?
**Rachel.hasan**: No, I can hear.
**Rachel.hasan**: I can hear whoever's speaking.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Jesse, your volume needs to change.
**Jdawson**: No, it's.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, it's just me and Jesse and.
**Speaker 2**: Then the other person.
**Jdawson**: This thing that says Fireflies is our.
**Jdawson**: Our AI note taker.
**Rachel.hasan**: Oh, it's amazing.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we.
**Jdawson**: We really embrace AI and, and it's much cutting edge technology as we can.
**Jdawson**: It's.
**Jdawson**: We're firm believers that in five years there are going to be two types of companies.
**Jdawson**: Those that utilize AI and those that are out of business.
**Rachel.hasan**: I agree.
**Rachel.hasan**: I was at a.
**Rachel.hasan**: So I don't know if you knew this, so I have interior design background for residential.
**Rachel.hasan**: I've done it for like 10 years.
**Rachel.hasan**: And anyway, I was at a conference at Market and it was a lot about, you know, AI and how it's kind of revolutionizing even the design industry.
**Rachel.hasan**: So.
**Rachel.hasan**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Oh, absolutely.
**Jdawson**: Have you, have you ever heard of the company called Icon?
**Rachel.hasan**: No, I have not.
**Jdawson**: So I was at their.
**Jdawson**: So I was at south by Southwest.
**Jdawson**: This.
**Jdawson**: Not this march, but the march before, and they unveiled their.
**Speaker 2**: Their newest robot.
**Jdawson**: And so what they do is they.
**Jdawson**: They.
**Jdawson**: It's a autonomous building component.
**Jdawson**: So for houses is what they do.
**Jdawson**: They're based out of Austin, Texas.
**Jdawson**: And the, the neat feature that they have too is they also have a database to where if you wanted to.
**Jdawson**: If you wanted to design something to say, I want a.
**Jdawson**: A ranch bungalow, Spanish style.
**Jdawson**: And it would do that.
**Jdawson**: And then it'll say, I want it to be three bedrooms, two bath, blah, blah, blah, like this many square feet.
**Jdawson**: And it'll put a floor plan together at elevations for you.
**Rachel.hasan**: That's amazing.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, it's.
**Jdawson**: It's pretty.
**Jdawson**: Pretty unreal how fast things are changing.
**Jdawson**: So it's exciting.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So, yeah, I did.
**Speaker 2**: I did some snooping on you.
**Speaker 2**: I was wondering if this RH Homes.
**Jdawson**: Was you or not, because I was looking for.
**Jdawson**: For Vo Vio Med Spa.
**Rachel.hasan**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: And so is this your first franchise?
**Rachel.hasan**: It is.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Exciting.
**Jdawson**: Exciting.
**Jdawson**: How's.
**Jdawson**: Is, I guess what made you want to get into it?
**Jdawson**: I mean, it's quite a jump from interior home design versus this.
**Rachel.hasan**: It is.
**Rachel.hasan**: Although I, I know a lot about the, the industry in general, and so probably on paper it looks like a huge shift, but in reality, you know, it's not.
**Rachel.hasan**: My husband's a physician and our partners, he's a physician and she's got a business background.
**Rachel.hasan**: So we just felt like it was just kind of a good, you know, next steps.
**Rachel.hasan**: It's such a booming industry, so we're very excited about it.
**Rachel.hasan**: And we love, you know, the franchise and their brand.
**Rachel.hasan**: They're a smaller company and so they have been really open in terms of just, you know, feedback, you know, about aesthetics and, you know, they're trying to kind of build their brand and they're at a pivotal point.
**Rachel.hasan**: So we're just very excited to, you know, be partnering with them.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah, it's, it's funny because they've got, in a lot of their locations is where we have either offices or active projects going on.
**Jdawson**: So, like the one that they've got outside of Tampa, we got an office there and then I saw they've got some in Dallas, Memphis, you know, so it's, I was like, wow, they're, they're really, really robust.
**Rachel.hasan**: Yeah, yeah, they're have grown like exponentially the past couple of years, so.
**Jdawson**: Awesome.
**Jdawson**: So, so you're looking for a space with Houston?
**Jdawson**: Have you guys settled on one?
**Jdawson**: Are you looking for some still?
**Jdawson**: I, I know there's a med spa in Carmel.
**Jdawson**: I'm assuming you're trying to be in Zionsville or Fishers.
**Rachel.hasan**: Yeah, so we want to be in Zionsville.
**Rachel.hasan**: That's kind of our location.
**Rachel.hasan**: There are other franchisees that have, you know, are looking at Fishers and then I think there may be, I think Westfield may be tied into Carmel.
**Rachel.hasan**: So we have, you know, several that are going to be built up in the area.
**Rachel.hasan**: Ours is specifically the Zionsville location.
**Rachel.hasan**: Have you, and so I'm just kind of curious, do you guys, you guys do the build outs?
**Rachel.hasan**: Design like talent, like what's your niche?
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: So we're, we're a design build firm.
**Jdawson**: Obviously, you know, the traditional method is design, then you bid it out and.
**Speaker 2**: Then you build it.
**Jdawson**: So you have a million dollar budget and the design comes back and it's 1.2 million.
**Jdawson**: Then you value engineer it and then you finally go to work.
**Jdawson**: So we switch it up and we say, all right, million dollar budget.
**Jdawson**: We're going to design and get some long lead items released so that you're condensing your schedule so that your debt carry is shorter, which especially in today's climate adds up a lot.
**Jdawson**: The sooner, the sooner you can get up open and make money, the better.
**Jdawson**: Especially if you're getting free months for, from the landlord for a lease.
**Rachel.hasan**: Gotcha.
**Jdawson**: So that's kind of our bread and butter.
**Jdawson**: You know, we work with business owners who are like, hey, I need to get open because I make a lot of money.
**Rachel.hasan**: Yeah.
**Rachel.hasan**: So my, so we have two things.
**Rachel.hasan**: So you, when you say design, do you do the architectural component of it in terms of the layout and the MEPs?
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Rachel.hasan**: Okay.
**Rachel.hasan**: So there were a couple of things and I talked to Bio corporate.
**Rachel.hasan**: You know, it's hard when you, when you have designed yourself.
**Rachel.hasan**: Right.
**Rachel.hasan**: Like you look at it through a different lens.
**Rachel.hasan**: And so I think they are there, they have some branding items that, you know, they, they need to be inclusive but they are looking at updating the aesthetic a little bit.
**Rachel.hasan**: So I think their previous aesthetic was a lot of like the grays, you know, the tile in terms of the faux gray, you know, hardwood floor looking tile, things like that.
**Rachel.hasan**: And just kind of knowing, you know, we had some conversations about, you know, like we're trending in a different direction.
**Rachel.hasan**: So now it's probably a good time to just kind of like update that overall, you know, aesthetic for them.
**Rachel.hasan**: They're super open to that.
**Rachel.hasan**: So I think, you know, whatever we, you know, come to an agreement with, you know, I think they'd like to use that moving forward corporate wide.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And that's, I mean that's common, you know, with, you know, they'll have their own programming.
**Jdawson**: We do that with a lot of different chains and if they're open to new ideas and new changes, that's even better.
**Jdawson**: That's definitely great when they can, you know, adjust with the time so, you know, we can definitely take what they like.
**Jdawson**: Hey, this is a hard, you know, we gotta have this.
**Jdawson**: And then, you know, obviously with your design background, I'm sure you're going to have a lot more about colors and textures and what you want to see.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that's a, that's a great recipe for success.
**Rachel.hasan**: Yeah.
**Rachel.hasan**: So I think that the way they like if we're looking at a new construction, leaving some of the flood subfloor, not forward to run lines and things like that.
**Rachel.hasan**: So I'm just assuming you have experience.
**Rachel.hasan**: I mean, I have residential experience, like commercial build outs.
**Rachel.hasan**: It's not my niche.
**Rachel.hasan**: So certainly have questions, you know, in regards to that process.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, so what you're referring to is, is what we call white boxing a space.
**Jdawson**: And that's exactly what it is.
**Jdawson**: So if you're building a ground up building and you want to have a tenant but you don't know the tenant is, then we'll white box it.
**Jdawson**: Now you also will do ground up buildings where you already Have a tenant, you know, that you know you're going to do, and then that's called a build to suit because we're building it to suit that tenant.
**Rachel.hasan**: Okay.
**Rachel.hasan**: So, so I think we, I think that.
**Rachel.hasan**: And you can correct me if I'm wrong, I just want to make sure that I understand the terms.
**Rachel.hasan**: Like the white box is probably subfloor's been laid, utilities, you know, stubbed in.
**Rachel.hasan**: Yeah.
**Rachel.hasan**: Would have systems and then the dark shell is, you know, those things not like, so not having the landlord provide havoc.
**Rachel.hasan**: We would run our lines into the, you know, the space based off of our specs, which is important because we have like specific equipment that needs to be run.
**Rachel.hasan**: So we need to have everything plumbed for, you know, to meet those specs.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, so.
**Jdawson**: So yes.
**Jdawson**: I mean you're, you've got the general idea, a typical white box, but there's a white box can still have what's called leave outs in your slab.
**Jdawson**: It just.
**Jdawson**: White box is just a general term for, it's an open structure for tennis to come in.
**Jdawson**: Like the, the parameters of, of what defines it as a white box are pretty broad and really not super important.
**Jdawson**: It's just a matter of what, what does, what do you want?
**Speaker 2**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Some, we've done some shells where they don't even have lights in it.
**Jdawson**: It's just completely a structure and it's open, no slab whatsoever.
**Jdawson**: Other times you do it fully completely and it's got drywall and white paint in it and that way people can walk in and see what it looks like.
**Jdawson**: So okay, for you, are you looking at building a building and then you're going to be the landlord and then have other franchisees in there or you just want to have multiple tenant building.
**Jdawson**: What is your goal?
**Rachel.hasan**: Well, so we had looked at a possibility of, of doing that and, and having a space where, you know, we had the space for the med Spa, but also, you know, having other tenants come in that may be something that we explore a little bit more down the road for, you know, adding.
**Rachel.hasan**: I mean, I guess our long term goal is to have more than one, you know, one med spa.
**Rachel.hasan**: We do have an opportunity now with the farm in Zionsville.
**Rachel.hasan**: Are you familiar with that?
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Rachel.hasan**: So we're exploring that pretty heavily.
**Rachel.hasan**: So that would be lease space and just kind of building out that space.
**Jdawson**: That's a great area too.
**Jdawson**: Right by Holiday Farms.
**Rachel.hasan**: Yeah, so that's, I think, you know, we're kind of leaning in that direction.
**Rachel.hasan**: Justin Born and you know, time frame, trying to get the business Running off the ground and things like that.
**Rachel.hasan**: And then, you know, so we don't have a permanent loi in, but those were the options that we're exploring.
**Rachel.hasan**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jdawson**: I mean, with being your first location, that allows you to lower your cap X so that you're coming in, you get some ti dollars, get up, get cash flow going.
**Jdawson**: And then now when you go get a SBA to build another building somewhere, it's.
**Jdawson**: It's much easier because you've got proof of concept.
**Rachel.hasan**: Yeah, yeah.
**Rachel.hasan**: So that's where we're at.
**Rachel.hasan**: And so it sounds like you are full service, I guess.
**Rachel.hasan**: Do you, do you just bid the project?
**Rachel.hasan**: Do you have fees for, you know, design and then putting a bid together?
**Rachel.hasan**: I mean, how does that work?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, so what we would do is.
**Jdawson**: So let's say that you're like, hey, Brandon, like, we want, you know, to go into this space.
**Jdawson**: It.
**Jdawson**: It, you know, 3,000 square foot, blah, blah, blah, like, all right, great.
**Jdawson**: So you'll have your, your programming or your spec.
**Jdawson**: Like, here's what we got to have.
**Jdawson**: We got to have six treatment rooms, a break room, this, that, the other, all that.
**Jdawson**: So we're going to do what's called a space plan and lay it out and say, all right, here's how this fits in.
**Jdawson**: Based off of this space, based off of what you want, and just kind of get a baseline.
**Jdawson**: And so then, you know, you're going to say, brandon, my, my budget's a million bucks.
**Jdawson**: Like, okay, great, so here's our space plan.
**Jdawson**: Then we're going to write up our, our spec based off of what finishes you want.
**Jdawson**: So the flooring, all that kind of stuff, and have some allowances for things we just don't know.
**Jdawson**: And then go out and, and get those numbers pulled together to where we're, you know, within 80, 90% of.
**Jdawson**: Of what the total is going to be.
**Jdawson**: And then that way we can say, hey, we're within budget, or we got to massage this thing a little bit to try to get this into budget.
**Jdawson**: So let's adjust some stuff here, maybe lower the ceiling, do two by fours versus two by twos, you know, just whatever different things that are driving that cost.
**Jdawson**: So to do that and to get a number, I mean, we'll do the space plan at our cost.
**Jdawson**: I mean, we have in house guys, it's, you know, I mean, I'm not going to charge you the 3, 4 grand it cost for us to turn that around.
**Jdawson**: And it's just not, not worth anybody's time.
**Jdawson**: We're confident Enough that whenever we're doing this, you're not going to want to go with anybody else.
**Jdawson**: And frankly, if you're not, then that means we screwed up.
**Rachel.hasan**: Okay.
**Rachel.hasan**: Now, I think that the vio, they do have some vendors that they require us to order certain, you know, like, our millwork through.
**Rachel.hasan**: They have, like a tile vendor, a lighting vendor.
**Rachel.hasan**: Is that an issue?
**Jdawson**: No.
**Jdawson**: Happens all the time.
**Rachel.hasan**: Okay.
**Speaker 2**: It just.
**Jdawson**: It's just like.
**Jdawson**: So whatever that is, we just need to know ahead of time.
**Jdawson**: And then so basically, like, let's say millwork, for instance, like, it has to come through whatever their company is, then we just will.
**Jdawson**: Either we'll order it direct and have.
**Speaker 2**: An install number, or we'll carry it with somebody.
**Jdawson**: I mean, you know, I don't.
**Jdawson**: It kind of depends on what the product is because we want to carry warranty, but, yeah, that's not.
**Jdawson**: That's not uncommon.
**Rachel.hasan**: Okay.
**Rachel.hasan**: So.
**Rachel.hasan**: Sorry, I have, like, some background noise going on.
**Rachel.hasan**: I'm trying to.
**Rachel.hasan**: Trying to focus with you guys.
**Rachel.hasan**: I don't know if you can hear that or not.
**Jdawson**: Sound like a baby.
**Jdawson**: Is that what that was?
**Rachel.hasan**: No, no.
**Rachel.hasan**: I have.
**Rachel.hasan**: I have a teenager home on spring break, and I have even worse.
**Rachel.hasan**: Yeah.
**Rachel.hasan**: So it's.
**Rachel.hasan**: It's a full house right now.
**Rachel.hasan**: I apologize for that.
**Jdawson**: I've got a sleeping dog in my office, so we're all there.
**Rachel.hasan**: There you go.
**Rachel.hasan**: Yeah, mine is not sleeping.
**Rachel.hasan**: I think she's actively barking somewhere.
**Rachel.hasan**: So.
**Rachel.hasan**: Okay.
**Rachel.hasan**: So next steps, you know, as we get farther in the process.
**Rachel.hasan**: I mean, I kind of wanted to touch base today just to, like, make an introduction, you know, visit a little bit.
**Rachel.hasan**: You know, we would finalize an loi, get in touch with you guys, send you that plan.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So if.
**Jdawson**: If you have a space, you know, it sounds like you're pretty solid on a space for.
**Jdawson**: For the farm.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, if you, you know, get a loi, or even if you.
**Jdawson**: I'm sure you already have a brochure and stuff like that.
**Jdawson**: You know, if you're pretty confident that's what you want to go, then shoot that over and, you know, we probably need to have a meeting figuring out what you want as far as, again, your specifications.
**Jdawson**: Like, I need a break room.
**Jdawson**: I need one office.
**Jdawson**: I need this many patient rooms or treatment rooms, I should say, like, different.
**Jdawson**: Whatever those parameters are.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Rachel.hasan**: With all of that together, I mean, we're not.
**Rachel.hasan**: We haven't finalized our loi.
**Rachel.hasan**: I think we.
**Rachel.hasan**: We thought we were going to do one space at the farm.
**Rachel.hasan**: I think we're transitioning So I think we're going to be looking at like their second phase.
**Rachel.hasan**: So we're a little bit farther out than what we thought initially like when we first shot the email to you guys.
**Rachel.hasan**: But you know, it is what it is with that.
**Rachel.hasan**: But we have all of the specs in terms of, you know, what we want.
**Rachel.hasan**: I think we're going to make some updates with finishes.
**Jdawson**: What, how many square feet are you looking?
**Rachel.hasan**: So we're looking ideally like 2, 20, 300 is about where we'll land.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And then so for the space in phase two that you're looking at, do you know, do they have an anticipated delivery date?
**Rachel.hasan**: We would not be looking at, I think sometime at the end of this year or beginning of 26 for when.
**Jdawson**: They would be done?
**Rachel.hasan**: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Rachel.hasan**: So our first initial space was in August.
**Rachel.hasan**: So it's, you know, we've had a little bit transpire the last week or so.
**Rachel.hasan**: But you know, so one, one thing.
**Jdawson**: One thing I would look at it if, if I were you is, you know, let's say that you, you, you lock in on that space and it's like, okay, it's gonna be done at the end of the year.
**Jdawson**: So you wanna negotiate and back into like getting access at a certain point for us to start our construction.
**Jdawson**: That way you can time it up to where when that building's done, you have very short amount of time before you're ready to open versus wait until they're done, then you start and you've got four months or whatever until you're done.
**Jdawson**: But there's a way that you can time that up and then that way you also can get some, some extra free months.
**Jdawson**: Like so say if you're going to negotiate four free months of space lease that you can get access to start your construction earlier then now all of a sudden maybe you're only under construction for two months out of that four and you get two months free.
**Rachel.hasan**: Okay.
**Rachel.hasan**: At what point do you guys like to walk into a space that's under construction?
**Rachel.hasan**: Because it sounds like you would work in tandem with the build out.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we work, we work in tandem.
**Jdawson**: I mean we would look at the schedule.
**Jdawson**: I mean in reality like they need to have their, their structure up.
**Jdawson**: Their structure, it meaning like all the steel and everything.
**Jdawson**: And then you know, even if the walls aren't are open, you know we're going to put power in there.
**Jdawson**: It's just, it's just some, some coordination to do so.
**Jdawson**: I mean it's, it's the structure is the main thing.
**Jdawson**: That has to be there.
**Jdawson**: A lot of the other stuff, you know, we can just fit in and do accordingly.
**Rachel.hasan**: Okay, so is you're basically saying once the exterior starts getting framed out where that framing is complete, you guys can start getting in for build out somewhere in that general time frame.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jdawson**: So when they're, when they're what's called dried in.
**Jdawson**: But it really, it also depends because once the actual steel decking is on and everything like in that structure.
**Jdawson**: So you know, for you, you've got maybe you've got to have some special units maybe for humidity control in certain areas, things like that.
**Jdawson**: We want to get it.
**Jdawson**: We'd want to get in there and cut and put those on or at least have our curbs in.
**Jdawson**: And then that way when, when they roof it, they're just flashing up to our curb versus roof it.
**Jdawson**: And then we come and cut a brand new roof, put a curb in and then reflash it.
**Jdawson**: So that's why I say the structure part.
**Jdawson**: So the steel decking and columns, that's again depending on what you want, which I think you're probably going to have some stress with the H Vac.
**Jdawson**: That would be ideal as far as cost effectiveness.
**Rachel.hasan**: Okay.
**Rachel.hasan**: No, that's great information to have certainly.
**Rachel.hasan**: Yeah, I guess it's.
**Rachel.hasan**: And this may sound like a dumb question or a dumb statement.
**Rachel.hasan**: I think one of my concerns and it just carries over from, you know, maybe we're doing like residential design and remodels and things like that.
**Rachel.hasan**: So just in terms of like negotiating out like some of the costs, I guess I've been a little concerned and it needs to be small potatoes.
**Rachel.hasan**: Just in terms of, you know, they're, they're a big builder, right?
**Rachel.hasan**: Like, so whatever contracts they negotiated for like their price of concrete or drywall or you know, whatever it is, like they probably have pretty good rates for those items, I would guess.
**Rachel.hasan**: And so as we leave those things out, right.
**Rachel.hasan**: And like we're, we're doing it after the fact.
**Rachel.hasan**: You know, my experience in, in residential is, you know, sometimes like if you don't have like the primary builder do that, where you're trying to retro, you know, do things after the fact, like those costs are tend to be higher.
**Rachel.hasan**: So do you see that in like commercial construction?
**Rachel.hasan**: Like is that an issue?
**Rachel.hasan**: Is it a non issue?
**Rachel.hasan**: It's something it's in.
**Rachel.hasan**: You know, I've been wondering about.
**Speaker 2**: So typically when you have this.
**Jdawson**: So, so that that developer and I can't remember who's building that for, maybe she'll Sexton.
**Jdawson**: But do what?
**Rachel.hasan**: Steve Pittman.
**Rachel.hasan**: Oh, the farm area.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jdawson**: I was thinking the builder, the contractor, I couldn't remember.
**Rachel.hasan**: Oh, gotcha.
**Jdawson**: I thought it was, I thought it was Shield Sexton, but I could be wrong.
**Jdawson**: Anyway, so typically, you know, they're a developer and most developers, yes, they're going to get great pricing from, you know.
**Speaker 2**: The builder up front.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Because they're coming in and bidding it to get the job and then they're moving.
**Jdawson**: What we typically see is that they'll get like when the tenants come in, you don't get that kind of pricing because they're going to make up what they lost on the last one.
**Jdawson**: So a prime example, we've got a job going on in Pennsylvania right now.
**Jdawson**: So the tenant who was moving into this existing building, they had the builder who did the base build bid out, you know, number.
**Jdawson**: They were like, oh my gosh, it's ridiculous.
**Jdawson**: You know, the client called us and said, hey, is there any chance you can take a look at this?
**Jdawson**: Put it together.
**Jdawson**: We beat the other guy's number by 2 million.
**Jdawson**: Again, not saying that that's the, you know, every single time it's like that, but that's pretty common.
**Jdawson**: So typically what we see is the tenant will get what's called TI dollars.
**Jdawson**: And so they're going to get $10 a square, something like that.
**Jdawson**: And then you can control that money and say, hey, I'm going to do this.
**Jdawson**: Because that builder, I mean, they don't.
**Speaker 2**: Really care about you.
**Jdawson**: They care about the landlord.
**Jdawson**: Like that's their client.
**Jdawson**: And so for you it's just, yeah, whatever, we'll get to it.
**Jdawson**: And so versus us, we've made our niche and working directly with tenants in exact cases like this because where you're, you know, you're our client, you know, with the landlord, it's just a person.
**Jdawson**: I don't care.
**Jdawson**: You know, my job is to get you open.
**Rachel.hasan**: Yeah, gotcha.
**Rachel.hasan**: No, makes sense.
**Rachel.hasan**: And you carry the warranty then?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, correct.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So you'll get a one year workmanship warranty.
**Jdawson**: So all of our us and all of our subs, everybody, you'll have warranties.
**Jdawson**: And then for different materials, you'll have what's called special warranties or manufacturer warranties for, for different things, you'll get a whole book with a bunch of stuff that you'll never look at until something goes wrong.
**Rachel.hasan**: Okay, how long, like what is your warranty coverage like?
**Rachel.hasan**: I'm sure it varies depending on what it is.
**Rachel.hasan**: Like in general.
**Jdawson**: So yeah, in general.
**Speaker 2**: It's in general, in the industry, it's one year workmanship, warranty.
**Jdawson**: So, you know, let's say that.
**Rachel.hasan**: You.
**Jdawson**: You know, your, your ceiling falls down with three months later, that would be a warranty item, you know.
**Jdawson**: Now let's say that in five years down the road, the water heater breaks.
**Jdawson**: That's not a warranty item.
**Rachel.hasan**: Gotcha.
**Rachel.hasan**: Okay.
**Rachel.hasan**: So I would imagine though that your, your havoc, your water heater, they have some sort of separate warranty, right?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I just, I said I just pulled parts out.
**Jdawson**: I mean.
**Rachel.hasan**: Yes, I know.
**Rachel.hasan**: I just wanted to.
**Rachel.hasan**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So, yeah, I don't know, off top of my head, different manufacturers carry different types of warranties, so.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Rachel.hasan**: Okay.
**Rachel.hasan**: Yeah, I mean, that's pretty standard.
**Rachel.hasan**: Just curious.
**Rachel.hasan**: Okay.
**Rachel.hasan**: I probably don't even know all of the questions to ask you today.
**Rachel.hasan**: You know, as we get a little bit more involved, you know, in the process, we can wrap back around.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, my questions, my cell number is in my signature, so I mean, feel free to text me questions or whatever as you have them.
**Rachel.hasan**: Okay, yeah, that would be.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I mean, the only real question, you know, I think we kind of answer most of my understand, you know, mainly what you're, what your programming is, which is always our biggest question is, is what are you wanting?
**Jdawson**: You know, which it sounds like.
**Jdawson**: Fortunately, the franchisor is giving you some flexibility, which is great.
**Jdawson**: You can put your own touch on it.
**Jdawson**: I guess the only thing is like, what are your concerns?
**Rachel.hasan**: You know, I think costs of build out, particularly if we're going with a space that we don't own.
**Rachel.hasan**: Right.
**Rachel.hasan**: Because we're, you know, investing, you know, into somebody else's face.
**Rachel.hasan**: So, you know, we want it to, you know, be luxurious and all the things, but just managing that a little bit.
**Rachel.hasan**: Right.
**Rachel.hasan**: Because we still want to invest like our own business, you know, viability.
**Rachel.hasan**: So, you know, managing cost of build out.
**Rachel.hasan**: I think time frame was another question that you really address that.
**Rachel.hasan**: And I'll wrap back around, you know, as we get a little bit more information on the loi.
**Rachel.hasan**: Shaquille is my business partner and he's kind of heading out the LOI component of it.
**Rachel.hasan**: So we, you know, we'll visit about that.
**Rachel.hasan**: That will give me a better idea to wrap back around to you, you know, in terms of the time frame.
**Rachel.hasan**: Good to know when you guys would be able to get in there.
**Rachel.hasan**: That helps a lot.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, certainly.
**Jdawson**: And it's all, again, it's, it's about working with the base builder and everything, which unless they're just jerks they should work with us.
**Jdawson**: Sandbox is plenty big, so there shouldn't be any issues there.
**Jdawson**: And then as far as.
**Jdawson**: So you mentioned budget, have you done a pro forma on this?
**Rachel.hasan**: We do and I budgeted probably like between like 150, 200 a square foot is where you know, we, we thought we would be at the end of the day.
**Jdawson**: So you're, you know, 460,000 and that's construction cost, right?
**Rachel.hasan**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: And then.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, so you'll have design and obviously your cost for permitting things like that on top of that.
**Rachel.hasan**: Yeah, we had those budgeted separately.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, gotcha.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I mean really the big driver you're going to have on that is what finishes you want.
**Jdawson**: You know, if you go Marvel Fours everywhere, it's going to be hard to hit that.
**Jdawson**: So that's probably the biggest delta I'd say just because at the end of the day a med spa is a B occupancy, it's not an I occupancy, so which is hospitals.
**Jdawson**: And so it's pretty simple.
**Jdawson**: On the component side, your, your cost variation is going to be on your finishes and then if you have to have any specialty mep.
**Jdawson**: So depending on what's going to be required, H vac wise, you know, those are really the main drivers that you're going to have as far as your delta to change what that final number is.
**Rachel.hasan**: Yeah.
**Rachel.hasan**: Now do you have a component so doing residential design.
**Rachel.hasan**: Right.
**Rachel.hasan**: Like if you wanted to ask me, you know, like what's a great carpet to put in your home or you know, a lux tile for your bathroom, you know, like I could be all over that in, in the commercial space.
**Rachel.hasan**: And because it's a med spa, like we have certain components, you know, that we have to meet because we're working with like bloodborne pathogens and you know, things like that.
**Rachel.hasan**: So we do have to have certain flooring that's non porous.
**Rachel.hasan**: I mean do you have like a, a component of your team that has the go tos, you know, for, for those options?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So, so as far as like here, like so for instance, for, for any medical space, whether it be medical office, iox, anything you want to have what's called cleanable surfaces so that nothing sticks and holds.
**Jdawson**: And so for your, for your office, that's going to get, I mean VCT is going to be your most cost effective solution.
**Jdawson**: But it looks like crap.
**Jdawson**: So LVP is another luxury Vinyl plank is another great option that is durable, easy to replace if it gets stinged, cleanable and it looks nice.
**Jdawson**: You can get a lot of different variations.
**Jdawson**: So as far as the manufacturer, Mohawk, you know, doesn't really matter, but that's a, that's a great one that I would go with.
**Jdawson**: And then, you know, your other components.
**Jdawson**: So like your ceiling, you know, you want to look.
**Jdawson**: You could do like a.
**Jdawson**: What's called a 2x4 second look.
**Jdawson**: So it looks like it's 2x2 tile, but it's actually 2x4.
**Jdawson**: That's a great cost effective solution to have for you guys.
**Jdawson**: And then LED lighting throughout.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I mean, we have certain, certain things that we just know through the industry of us doing this of what, what is our most cost effective solution.
**Speaker 2**: To meet the specifications?
**Rachel.hasan**: Okay.
**Rachel.hasan**: No, that was.
**Rachel.hasan**: Has kind of been a big question for me.
**Rachel.hasan**: So I had mentioned the LVP because I put that in residential homes.
**Rachel.hasan**: You know, it's a great product.
**Rachel.hasan**: You know, people have kids and dogs.
**Rachel.hasan**: I mean, it's like indestructible.
**Rachel.hasan**: And you have so many great products that it looks, you know, like the real, you know, like a real floor.
**Rachel.hasan**: And so I think that if I could get some, you know, as we get into the process, don't have to be today or you know, an email or anything next week, but you know, just an LVV product that, that meets like the bloodborne pathogen standards.
**Rachel.hasan**: Because I think that they corporate, you know, really felt like tile was a better option.
**Rachel.hasan**: I personally prefer lvp.
**Rachel.hasan**: If you need to change it, you can.
**Rachel.hasan**: It's easier, you know, tile, like once you're in with tile, you're in with tile and you're not.
**Rachel.hasan**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And the cost.
**Rachel.hasan**: Yeah, yeah.
**Rachel.hasan**: Like, you know, even if we had really cheap tile, it's the labor lay it, you know, versus labor over an lvp.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So absolutely.
**Jdawson**: And.
**Jdawson**: And you got to worry about moisture mitigation.
**Jdawson**: A lot of different things that come in, you get pockets.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I definitely think so.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I mean we can definitely.
**Rachel.hasan**: If it cracks, I mean.
**Rachel.hasan**: Yeah, there's a lot.
**Jdawson**: Exactly.
**Jdawson**: So yeah, we can definitely, you know, as, as we, as we move through and you're like, hey, Brandon, here's the space, here's kind of what the rooms we want.
**Jdawson**: Then we can say, okay, like, because you don't need blood poor pathogen in your office, you could have, you know, carpet tile if you wanted.
**Speaker 2**: Right.
**Jdawson**: You got to have it everywhere that patients are going to be.
**Jdawson**: It's.
**Jdawson**: Oh, looking at what those requirements are and hey, we're going to have this, this, this.
**Jdawson**: Then it's like all right, so here's what we would suggest for this.
**Jdawson**: This is your most cost effective solution.
**Jdawson**: And here's for this and this and this and this.
**Jdawson**: So, yeah, that'll all be part of that preliminary space plan design.
**Rachel.hasan**: Okay, great.
**Rachel.hasan**: Because I have an idea of color and components and things like that.
**Rachel.hasan**: But like sourcing commercial finishes is not, you know, it's not something I've done a lot of.
**Rachel.hasan**: So it's something that I would, you know, prefer to like collaborate on that.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, but absolutely.
**Rachel.hasan**: Just.
**Rachel.hasan**: Yeah, but just in general, like, I know, I know, like a different flooring.
**Rachel.hasan**: Right.
**Rachel.hasan**: Option, like an LVP or whatever it is, is going to be like less expensive than tile.
**Rachel.hasan**: And I don't think you're sacrificing the aesthetic look of it.
**Rachel.hasan**: Like, I think you can get a luxe, you know, look.
**Rachel.hasan**: So when clients walk in, you know, like they feel the environment, you know.
**Jdawson**: Absolutely.
**Jdawson**: I mean, we haven't spend money, you.
**Rachel.hasan**: Know, in other areas.
**Rachel.hasan**: Like a great chandelier, you know, in the lobby that looks, pulls the eyes up, right?
**Jdawson**: Yes, we have, we have LVP in both our offices.
**Jdawson**: I have it in my house.
**Jdawson**: Like, I love the product.
**Jdawson**: I think it's great.
**Jdawson**: I mean, we put it in all the time.
**Rachel.hasan**: Yeah.
**Rachel.hasan**: Oh, yeah.
**Rachel.hasan**: The last, I mean, my price point that I work in, you know, it's usually million dollar houses and people aren't even like second guessing putting it into the houses anymore because like some of the product is so amazing, you just don't know unless you're really touching it, so.
**Jdawson**: Right, exactly.
**Jdawson**: To the normal person, they have no idea.
**Jdawson**: And it, it beats the hell out of engineered hardwood or even hardwood, you know, I mean, you can't, you can tell a difference from the thickness and the way you walk on it.
**Jdawson**: Like, you can, you can feel that, that give.
**Jdawson**: But I mean, for the price difference, it's.
**Jdawson**: You can't tell that much of a difference.
**Rachel.hasan**: Okay, Right.
**Rachel.hasan**: Trying to think.
**Rachel.hasan**: If I have any other questions, I'm sure that when I hang up I will, I will think of, you know, some.
**Rachel.hasan**: But I just appreciate just kind of having, you know, the initial, you know, face to face and chatting.
**Rachel.hasan**: Did you have any more questions for me?
**Jdawson**: No.
**Jdawson**: I mean, this is, you know, for us this is pretty, pretty common, pretty normal.
**Jdawson**: This is our day to day stuff.
**Jdawson**: So, you know, we understand, especially with somebody, you know, this is their first one.
**Jdawson**: What they need, what do they not see, what they don't even know to ask.
**Rachel.hasan**: Right.
**Jdawson**: So that's, that's the kind of thing like we know exactly what it's going to take and, and you know, what, what hiccups you're going to hit.
**Rachel.hasan**: Yeah, no, that's great.
**Rachel.hasan**: Oh, I just had a question.
**Rachel.hasan**: Now it's escaping me.
**Rachel.hasan**: Oh.
**Rachel.hasan**: In terms of the space planning.
**Jdawson**: I.
**Rachel.hasan**: Guess it's something like, it's more design related.
**Rachel.hasan**: So in, in touring, you know, some of the med spas and actually, and I've got friends that own med spots, you know, here locally.
**Rachel.hasan**: So it's not even just the, you know, the, you know, brand, you know, I.
**Rachel.hasan**: My eye cat, you know, when you're in it, right?
**Rachel.hasan**: And you do things like your eye catches, right?
**Jdawson**: Absolutely.
**Jdawson**: When you're, when you're a customer, you say, I like this, I don't like this.
**Rachel.hasan**: Yeah.
**Rachel.hasan**: But one of the things I notice in terms of planning and I, and it may come down to like a revenue decision too, right?
**Rachel.hasan**: Because like, if you can take space and you can get, you know, six, seven treatment rooms versus I, you know, for I guess eight or nine versus six or seven, right.
**Rachel.hasan**: Like you, you're going to go with a higher amount, right?
**Rachel.hasan**: Because that's in terms of like generating your, your revenues over time.
**Rachel.hasan**: But one of the things I noticed in terms of layout and this is probably something we do in the planning process is that in a lot of the med spas, they don't have the millwork and access to the treatment provider.
**Rachel.hasan**: So what you're.
**Rachel.hasan**: You're ending up with is a lot of carts in the treatment rooms, like with all their stuff on it and then the, you know, like they're not really using, you know, the cabinetry you're spending all of this money on.
**Rachel.hasan**: So I guess, you know, in my mind, like I had kind of reworked it out to make the treatment rooms like a little bit longer, I guess, so you could have the millwork, have the treatment provider and then your treatment tables and things like that.
**Rachel.hasan**: So I guess, you know, I guess what I'm saying is like, when we get into, you know, that planning phase, you know, maybe just to be able to provide, you know, some feedback so we could think about like the functionality of like how those rooms are being used.
**Rachel.hasan**: Because I feel like sometimes there are and, and listen, I may make, you know, we may make the decision like we'll just keep with the status quo, but it seems like, you know, they're set up, you know, just in terms of like what that box room fits the most of, not necessarily thought out in terms of like the function of how the service is provided.
**Rachel.hasan**: Does that make sense.
**Jdawson**: Absolutely.
**Jdawson**: And.
**Jdawson**: And without knowing those spaces, I mean, there's a lot of variables.
**Jdawson**: Right?
**Jdawson**: You.
**Jdawson**: You said the first one cost, right.
**Jdawson**: Casework costs money.
**Jdawson**: 2.
**Rachel.hasan**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: What was the existing layout?
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Like, did they come into a space and they kind of just had to make do because they didn't want to knock down walls and stuff?
**Jdawson**: So, yeah, I mean, it's.
**Speaker 2**: And it's looking at your operation, right?
**Jdawson**: So, you know, do you.
**Jdawson**: You need casework in every room because you're going to have a set of.
**Jdawson**: Of tools that are going to be used, and there's for that room, and you don't want to have to push a cart into different ones that, you know, that makes sense.
**Jdawson**: How many staff are you going to have working at any given time?
**Jdawson**: So all those things are kind of what we look at on the ownership side of things, because we, you know, we're not just, you know, anybody can put up four walls in a.
**Jdawson**: In a roof, but the end of the day, like, we're in this for your success, right?
**Jdawson**: If you're not.
**Jdawson**: If you.
**Jdawson**: If you put all this building in there and you're not cash flowing and you're closing 18 months later, I mean, who cares, right?
**Jdawson**: I mean, that.
**Speaker 2**: That means nothing.
**Jdawson**: I want to make you successful.
**Jdawson**: So you build 10 of them, and then you tell all your friends, and they're like, oh, my gosh.
**Jdawson**: Like, Brandon worked with me on the business side of things, like, to where we made sure that we had good.
**Jdawson**: We increased our revenue, we lowered our Cap X to where we were more efficient, we thought about flow.
**Jdawson**: You know, where are we cleaning, where we're sterilizing, how can we maximize the footprint?
**Jdawson**: So all those things are definitely what to look at.
**Jdawson**: And I love where your head's at thinking about the operational efficiency tied to revenue and Cap X, which is lowering your expense ratio.
**Jdawson**: So that's huge.
**Rachel.hasan**: Yeah.
**Rachel.hasan**: Okay, good.
**Rachel.hasan**: Yeah.
**Rachel.hasan**: I liked everything you said there, so appreciate.
**Rachel.hasan**: Thanks, Brandon.
**Jdawson**: You're welcome.
**Rachel.hasan**: Yeah, it sounds like we're very much, you know, probably on.
**Rachel.hasan**: On the same page with things.
**Rachel.hasan**: And I appreciate that you guys bring expertise, you know, that, you know, I don't have, you know, not having done, you know, a commercial build out before, so certainly.
**Jdawson**: And I'm not going to sit here and tell you.
**Jdawson**: I mean, you're gonna say, I'm like, yeah, white looks good to me.
**Jdawson**: Like, I don't know, like, you're no Brandon.
**Jdawson**: Like, the depth.
**Jdawson**: And you got to look at this and.
**Jdawson**: And think about how that catches their eye.
**Jdawson**: I'm like, yeah, okay, whatever you say.
**Jdawson**: I don't.
**Jdawson**: Colors or colors.
**Jdawson**: You know, I'm going to say blue.
**Jdawson**: You're going to say, no, that's taupe.
**Jdawson**: Like, okay, yeah.
**Rachel.hasan**: So it sounds like I could just put together kind of a vision board, you know, in terms of, like, general aesthetic.
**Rachel.hasan**: I know the IO corporate said, you know, they would approve that.
**Rachel.hasan**: And then it sounds like when we get to that process, that your group can kind of help source, you know, the materials.
**Rachel.hasan**: I mean, if I, if I, you know, have them for you ahead of time, I'll let you know.
**Rachel.hasan**: But you guys could give feedback.
**Rachel.hasan**: Like, hey, FYI, this could give you the same look, but save X dollars.
**Speaker 2**: Exactly.
**Jdawson**: So if you have, like, what's called a sample board, like, we do those all the time where they're like, okay, well, I want this, you know, these, this paint color and blah, blah, blah, blah.
**Jdawson**: So if you have all that and then we, you know, have our space plan, we can look at it and say, like, okay, that's great.
**Jdawson**: This, you know, quartz countertops that you have.
**Jdawson**: Everybody everywhere is driving up quite a bit of cost.
**Jdawson**: However, if we switch to plastic laminate, we can put this Pl on it and it looks similar or things like that.
**Jdawson**: I mean, that's.
**Jdawson**: That's where we look at how do we massage that number.
**Jdawson**: And that's.
**Speaker 2**: That's part of that design build process.
**Jdawson**: Versus a design bid build that would.
**Speaker 2**: Have all been there.
**Speaker 2**: And then you get the number and.
**Jdawson**: You say, oh, my gosh.
**Jdawson**: Versus, we're gonna say, wait a minute up front.
**Jdawson**: Let's, let's, you know, do this ahead of time before we get way down the road.
**Rachel.hasan**: Sure.
**Rachel.hasan**: Yeah.
**Rachel.hasan**: No, that's good.
**Rachel.hasan**: Well, and I think our situation is a little bit unique where it's not, you know, like our individual product.
**Rachel.hasan**: Like, we're making, you know, the decisions because we do have a franchisees, but we're also a little bit different where, you know, some franchise, like, they're so set, like you're just building, like, their component.
**Rachel.hasan**: So it's a little bit of a unique situation where you're kind of getting a hybrid of both.
**Rachel.hasan**: But I think it's great that you guys are a national company.
**Rachel.hasan**: I know the corporate office, you know, is looking to add to their portfolio.
**Rachel.hasan**: I think that they do have some national builders, but they just said, like, they're, you know, like they're so busy, you know, you get stretched thin.
**Rachel.hasan**: So having.
**Rachel.hasan**: Having some options brought to them is then well, well received.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, certainly.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we'd love to have an introduction with, you know, some of the national team.
**Jdawson**: And look at that.
**Jdawson**: I mean, you know, we're really about relationships where we're in a fortunate situation where we don't go out asking for work.
**Jdawson**: We, you know, see, hey, is this a good fit?
**Jdawson**: Are you the type of owner that we want to work with?
**Jdawson**: Because, I mean, life's too short to work with people you don't like, and that's just not what we're going to do.
**Rachel.hasan**: I feel that on so many levels, Brandon.
**Jdawson**: So, yeah, no, like I said, we're excited about it.
**Jdawson**: You know, I work with Houston on several others, and I know that he doesn't put up with, you know, people who are not fun.
**Jdawson**: So every time he.
**Rachel.hasan**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: Recommends us, we know it's.
**Jdawson**: It's typically a great person that we want to partner with.
**Rachel.hasan**: Yeah, yeah.
**Rachel.hasan**: Well, he's been.
**Rachel.hasan**: He's great guy.
**Rachel.hasan**: He and Shaquille, who's my partner, I think have done previous real estate deals together and have good rapport.
**Rachel.hasan**: So I have a lot of faith in, you know, when people make recommendations.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, certainly.
**Jdawson**: I mean, it's your name, so you got to.
**Rachel.hasan**: Yeah, yeah.
**Rachel.hasan**: Well, I think.
**Rachel.hasan**: I think you kind of got me on a great starting point.
**Rachel.hasan**: I'm going to kind of recap the information that we talked to back to my group, and we're, you know, probably need a couple of weeks as we get a feel for where we're at with the loi before we wrap back around.
**Rachel.hasan**: But if anything comes up in the meantime, I'll shoot you.
**Rachel.hasan**: I don't know if you have my cell.
**Rachel.hasan**: I'll shoot an email with my contact information.
**Rachel.hasan**: I have your info, so.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, certainly.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: And then I'll send you.
**Jdawson**: I'll send you the notes and everything from this so you have it, and there will be a full recording everything to share it with your partner so that they can look at it as well.
**Rachel.hasan**: Yeah, that's great.
**Rachel.hasan**: And efficient.
**Rachel.hasan**: Beyond.
**Jdawson**: It's.
**Jdawson**: It's the best thing ever because it allows you to be present in a meeting and not worry about writing stuff down.
**Rachel.hasan**: Yeah.
**Rachel.hasan**: You know, ironically, I was writing little notes as we were chatting, but I'm like, you know, the AI is a.
**Rachel.hasan**: Is a friend.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, absolutely.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: Well, yeah, I've enjoyed the time, Rachel.
**Jdawson**: And like I said, if you have.
**Speaker 2**: If questions pop up, which I know.
**Jdawson**: They will, then just feel free to shoot me a text.
**Jdawson**: Happy to respond and provide what clarifications I can.
**Rachel.hasan**: Okay, Sounds great.
**Jdawson**: Thank you.
**Jdawson**: Have a great day.
**Rachel.hasan**: You too, Brandon.
**Rachel.hasan**: Bye.
