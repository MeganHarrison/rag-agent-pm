## Transcript
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Yo, what up, boo?
**Jdawson**: Oh, here in Burnville.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Burnville.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: I'm.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Well, I gotta write one quick email requesting a set of drawings.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Requesting.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: This guy's name is Vinnie.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Vinnie Greco.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: You think he's Italian?
**Christopher.w.lopez**: I do for sure.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: I just had a long ass presentation with Medic Cell.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: You know, medico.
**Jdawson**: Nope.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: They manage all of the Ascension health properties.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Like St.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Vincent and all them.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, there's Jesse.
**Jdawson**: Hey, Jesse.
**Speaker 2**: Hey, what's up?
**Speaker 2**: How you doing, Chris?
**Christopher.w.lopez**: What's going on, Jesse?
**Speaker 2**: Not much.
**Speaker 2**: I downloaded the fire sprinkler permit app.
**Speaker 2**: I'll email that over to you.
**Speaker 2**: It's the town of Lopez Noa or something.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: And is it.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Is it.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Isn't it close to New Jersey?
**Speaker 2**: It's in New Jersey.
**Jdawson**: Phillipsburg.
**Speaker 2**: Nope.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: New Jersey is one of the.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Is one of the highest paid sprinkler fitter areas in the country of all places, for some reason.
**Speaker 2**: This is Lopa Tacong, New Jersey Building Department.
**Speaker 2**: Or Lopa Tacong Township.
**Jdawson**: It's gonna take me some getting used to saying that.
**Speaker 2**: I thought they just call it low pad, but it's good to get going.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: All right, let me see what I got here.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Let me see what I have here.
**Jdawson**: Go ahead and share your screen, Chris.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: I will here once I get to the right stuff here.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: I got all this confidential information open here.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Super secret sprinkler drawings.
**Speaker 2**: Alex, why is some chick's leg hanging off the side of your bed?
**Christopher.w.lopez**: I know it, right?
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Oh.
**Jdawson**: Oh.
**Speaker 2**: Oh, no.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: That's a dude.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Sorry.
**Jdawson**: Just to be clear.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: That's a dude.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Jesus, that's great.
**Jdawson**: And we got fireflies in here.
**Jdawson**: Taking notes on this.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Oh, I forgot about that.
**Speaker 2**: Brandon can edit those.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we're gonna walk out.
**Speaker 2**: I've left mine on for like an hour after a meeting, and then I've made phone calls and talk all kinds of like.
**Speaker 2**: Damn it, get rid of this thing.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Oh, all right.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: I'm gonna share away.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Here.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Yeah, let me.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: It is an exotech.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Thank God.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Sweet.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Okay, this is the.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: This is the one where the freaking CAD draw or the damn pdfs are.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Pain in the ass.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Open Uniqlo matrix.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: We already went over this.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Sorry, I'm just trying to find the Damn right center.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: P.S.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: they don't organize these very well when they send them over.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, this is the one that I saw in our folder.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Yeah, right here.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: These two bastards, they're just mirror images of each other.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: So quick.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Quick overlay or quick system set up?
**Christopher.w.lopez**: The plan is to separate.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: This is going to be two risers only Two risers, Alex.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Luckily there's a manifold.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Right here's the bathroom.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Where's that manifold at?
**Jdawson**: By a main door somewhere.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Yeah, there's.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Yeah.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: So there's.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: I think.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: I think I have them on the actual CAD drawings.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: But there's a manifold real close.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Basically straight, like straight over here somewhere.
**Jdawson**: So are we building two off of the same?
**Christopher.w.lopez**: I don't know if there's gonna be enough room.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: And the problem is you're gonna have to go like four bays over if you're going to do two.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: My thought would be.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: If you could.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Let me see.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: My thought is based on.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Okay, based on space.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: That's right.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: I had to delete because these drawings are like really rough on this computer.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: So if you were to do like a riser setup like this, like if you took the end of the man, pretend this was a T on the run.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Like a T was the other way.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: If that was the end, you hook a T up to it and do two risers like real close to each other like that.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: And then you can just gang them together with the drain.
**Jdawson**: Both 6 inch.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Yeah, these are.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: This is the big system.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: You're only going to need, I mean three, three and a half feet I would imagine, and maybe not even three through that drain.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: You could probably put that drain on the other side.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: So if you're really like flange.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: The flange, you're like say three foot.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Yeah, Clearance.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: So if you can get that off the manifold, which would be nice and maybe in good shape.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: So anyways, this is the layout.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: This is your.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Your.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: You're going to be doing Your standard staggered 11.2 and your small ones.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: And then you got the center flu and then the every.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Every other.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Only faces.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Well, your flu is going to be every.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Every transverse blue space and your face is going to be every other transverse blue space.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Okay.
**Speaker 2**: Did Brandon talk to you about like these guys came up that we needed deflectors on some of these heads.
**Speaker 2**: I don't know a certain location.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Yeah, the water.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Yeah, the water shields.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: We'll need water shields on only.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: The.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Only the first level.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: It's only two levels.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: So.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: So half the heads and I would think because.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: So the heads aren't staggered.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: So I'll have to double check with the face if we're gonna need.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: I don't think we'll need shields on that because those bins still provide a pretty good.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: I gotta see what the requirement of like that actual shield is.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: This is obvious, right?
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Because you got a six inch gap.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Water is Going to go down.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: You've got a transverse flu space that's 2 inches wide.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: You know what I mean?
**Christopher.w.lopez**: So worst case scenario, assume that you're just putting water shields on the first level, all heads.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: And then best case scenario, it's just the flu spaces.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Just the.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: And then you don't have to worry about the small racks because they're staggered.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, I think they said that.
**Speaker 2**: I just put Brandon.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Yeah, no, yeah, it's becoming a thing.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Yeah.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: The whole.
**Jdawson**: So from first level to second level, are they.
**Jdawson**: Are they staggered there?
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Only the small.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Only the small racks.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Only the two end pieces.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: This will be.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: This is a staggered.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: This is staggered.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: And then these are just straight on top of each other.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: From top to bottom.
**Jdawson**: They're on top of each other.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: And you're just two levels, I believe.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Go back here.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: There's another drawing there.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: You.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Here's the section of the robo arm.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: What's 11,702 millimeters?
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Just quick use.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: He's got European math down.
**Jdawson**: Don't ask me.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Hold on, I got the calculator right here.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: This is America, right?
**Jdawson**: We use our own.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: We use American units.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: This is millimeters to beat.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: This is1702.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Okay, so I.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: This one we're actually using the 20.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: This is the one we're using the 22s on.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Okay, so we're doing two levels of 22s.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: It's 38ft tall.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: We'll be at 15 and 30 for sprinkler must.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Actually, you know what, let me double check these two New Jersey ones like you.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: You know, I might have them a little bit backwards here.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Let me double check what I wrote because I think we were taught.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: We were talking about.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: We ran the.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: We ran the pricing like every which way.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: We ended up doing.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: I want to say the 22s were cheaper.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Oh, no.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: I guess we're doing them.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Okay, so I lied to you, Alex.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: We're doing the three rows of 11 2.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Okay, so this is the same.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: They've got the same kind of U bolt design as the canop, but it's an exotech, man.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: So we know we've done these before.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: We did it in Ulta.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: We didn't have to do it that way.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: But if you look at their.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: They provided us legit into.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: So they're just saying you bolt over the top and there's enough room saying 154 millimeters, which is going to be.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: And we should know right at the bed if it's going to work.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Millimeters to inches.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: That's given six and an eighth inch the top of that water to the top of the water field.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: What size pipe they're calling out?
**Christopher.w.lopez**: We haven't calculated this but we assume 2 inch at the worst.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: I don't think that's gonna fit.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: These guys have.
**Jdawson**: I don't either.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: They have some.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: What we can.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Okay, so what we can do then what we could put.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Well, so when we go into design for.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: So look and they come with 144, 140 millimeters max from with the VK531.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: And that's the.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: We can't use that anymore.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: We have to use the reliable.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: But they're the same heads.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: They're just too expensive.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: It.
**Jdawson**: With inch and a half line, the outlets and the reliable 11.2s.
**Jdawson**: It's six and a half inches.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Six and a half.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: So during the engineering phase we.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: We're just gonna have to tell them that these dimensions don't work.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: You cannot use the VK531 because the shield is not listed for that head.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: The VK531 does not have a listed head guard and shield.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: That reliable one is the only one that comes listed.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Now I can double check that.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: I know I was looking at a different sheet last time, but I am 99.999% certain about that 531 so.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: But if I remember exotic is the Ulta right?
**Jdawson**: No, that's opex.
**Jdawson**: Exotech is Mooresville, Atlanta.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: So Memphis, which we.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: We hung completely different than this.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, they had the brackets so that the new one's that.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: We need to.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: We need to just have that conversation during design.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Like this does not work.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Like these numbers are wrong.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Like that doesn't even add up.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: That's a two inch pipe with a two and three quarter inch head on it.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: That that overall dimension is actually I can tell you this should have it right here.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: This is the three one with yeah.
**Jdawson**: Six and a half.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: That's a five and that's a five.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Three one on a two inch pipe.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: And that is two scale.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: And you are right, six and a half.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: So by the look of their own drawing, it does not fit.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: So we'll make note of that right now ahead of time when we go into engineering, we can have a discussion.
**Speaker 2**: Well, are you saying they can adjust that?
**Christopher.w.lopez**: What?
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Because this one's not like the other ones where this bracket that they have attached here.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Now I've never seen it with these cross members here on it.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: But this bracket is separate to this rack.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: The ones in like where Burnville are being used to attach like a platform that goes across so they weren't independent of each other.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: So I would imagine this could move up or down or we hang below it, but we gotta see how much space they're actually giving us between.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Between bins for our piping.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Right.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Like whatever, whatever this gap is, we have to determine how, how to hang it now because I mean that's what we're finding.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: I mean it does not fit or, or I guess we would do pendants, right?
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Alex, we did roll this.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: We've never done pendants and exotics and.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: They, and they spec upright say offset screen is between back to back support direction for racing.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: That's just for this.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: 90 millimeters.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: 3 inches, 3 and a half inches.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: They're exceeding the rules.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: So I mean that's what we have on everything for now.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: What we're gonna do or what we should.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: I guess what we need to do is request the most current AutoCAD.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: We need section drawings.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: We need four plans or like you know, a four plan style drone and then like a complete site plan with like the warehouse.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: I don't believe I've got those.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: And double check the OneDrive that I have.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Yeah, these are just the section and these are all just PDFs sets that I have.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: So yeah, it's really what we need.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Need that like ASAP so that we can get the design done so that we can get fab fabless loose materials together and over to Corn Main and.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Get pricing and I mean, so what's the.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Is there any indication of a start date?
**Jdawson**: That's what I, that's what I want to know.
**Jdawson**: I mean, told me this morning that.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: We got it with like.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Have they started erecting the racks yet?
**Jdawson**: I don't know.
**Speaker 2**: That.
**Speaker 2**: I don't know.
**Speaker 2**: And it.
**Speaker 2**: I know they're gonna, they're like just waiting to start and they're just antsy to get us going.
**Speaker 2**: So again, Brandon will be back tomorrow and he can answer all that.
**Speaker 2**: But what we don't want to do is wait around and not get our materials ordered and then if the prices go up, like we're stuck in at a contract amount now.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Yeah, absolutely.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Just the thing is like we have to have the design done so we can do the fab list so we can do loose materials list so that we can send that.
**Jdawson**: I know, but you can get pricing.
**Speaker 2**: You can.
**Speaker 2**: What I'm saying is I would just, you know, write a PO or something to Them just saying, hey, we're going to buy at least this much pipe from you.
**Speaker 2**: We'll adjust it a little bit here.
**Speaker 2**: There's and same thing with the heads.
**Speaker 2**: Like if you know within a couple hundred heads what you need, write the PO for those heads right now and finalize the order when we finalize the design.
**Speaker 2**: But at least then we're safe.
**Speaker 2**: If it takes us a week or two to get the design done or.
**Speaker 2**: I know, Chris, is this a day's worth of work for you?
**Speaker 2**: How long is this going to take?
**Christopher.w.lopez**: This one?
**Christopher.w.lopez**: I mean, a week.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: I mean, if I.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: From when I get the right drawings, give me one week, give me five days to get it all square.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: I could turn these.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: I could turn this pretty quick.
**Speaker 2**: Okay, so that's all the general idea of what we're going to need.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: We've got a head count already.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Okay, we understand we need 10,288 heads.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: I can give you a general approximation of line piping right here.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: If we took this.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: This is.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: This should be for one level.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: And I know corn main can do kind of a.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Well, they can lock in kind of a like a slick price for you.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Not bad.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: If you have four 39 times three times two, you about 30,000ft of two inch that you can quote.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Have them give you a price today on that.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: They.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: They usually hold it for a couple, you know, for a little bit.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: If you're saying.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: And that's your.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: That's the majority of your pipe.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: You're not even talking.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: You're talking maybe a thousand feet of other pipes.
**Speaker 2**: Okay, we're good.
**Speaker 2**: And Alex, that's what we got to do tomorrow.
**Speaker 2**: Get these people.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I'll call Ryan.
**Jdawson**: Corn Maine up here.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Yep.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Yeah, we used to do.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: We used to do that back in the day too.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: I know exactly.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: I know you're trying.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: I understand the process, but.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Yeah.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: When you're trying to accomplish here for this just to get a.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Yeah.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Did you guys see we just got an 8%.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: I got hit with 8% two days ago, effective immediately.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: So.
**Speaker 2**: Well, it takes longer to get to New Jersey.
**Speaker 2**: So we got until tomorrow morning to get this in before they get the same hike.
**Speaker 2**: Because I talked my electrician today.
**Speaker 2**: Copper's gone up 25 or 27%.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Yeah, we're up to total 20, 26 in three weeks with an 8, a 10 and an 8 in the last three weeks.
**Speaker 2**: See, that's what is the tariffs.
**Speaker 2**: 10%.
**Speaker 2**: And they're just raising their up.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Right.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: So.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Yeah, I guess.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Alex, I don't know who we do the contact at Exotech or Uniqlo to get these drawings over.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: I'll just write you an email, Alex, with what I need.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I mean, I don't know.
**Jdawson**: I don't know who we're talking to either.
**Jdawson**: Like, literally, I don't.
**Jdawson**: I didn't know anything about this job until 11:12 this morning.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Congratulations.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: You're a father.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: You are the father now.
**Jdawson**: I called you at 11:16.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: I know.
**Jdawson**: All right, let's get the ball rolling.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: I'm, like, happy.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Here we go again.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: No, it's all right.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: We're all right.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: We're all right.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: We're a lot further ahead than we think.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Yeah, that's pretty much it.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 2**: Good deal.
**Speaker 2**: Well, you send those.
**Speaker 2**: Just email us all, Alex, me, Brandon, your.
**Speaker 2**: Your estimated, you know, what you took off and then.
**Speaker 2**: And sizes.
**Speaker 2**: And.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: We can do that.
**Speaker 2**: Get her ordered.
**Speaker 2**: And then I'm filling out the permit application now.
**Speaker 2**: And we'll have to.
**Speaker 2**: Like I said, Brandon, I'd have to have you guys.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: And I think Brandon, I mean, because I was working with Brandon, I think he's already got a.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: A labor contract, right?
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Or guys, he's already sourced.
**Speaker 2**: I think it's the same ones you guys used, ain't it, Alex?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Jdawson**: Because talking to my foreman here, he.
**Jdawson**: He actually, like, pulled up a job, like, on his phone, and it was Uniqlo.
**Jdawson**: I was like, yeah, that's us.
**Jdawson**: Like, no, yeah, they know.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Yeah, very good.
**Jdawson**: But in the jobs folder, like, I.
**Jdawson**: I see nothing.
**Jdawson**: Like, I don't have.
**Jdawson**: I don't see any of the estimates that we received from Deem or that one that you sent Jesse.
**Speaker 2**: The DE is in there.
**Speaker 2**: It's in the bid response folder.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: You got my $200,000 design fee in there.
**Speaker 2**: We plugged 20.
**Speaker 2**: That's what you told us.
**Speaker 2**: I thought.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: No, I'm kidding with you.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Big responses.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: It's third.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: It's 30.
**Speaker 2**: 30.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: It's actually, it's actually 75, but I kept bringing a deal.
**Jdawson**: H Vac is empty.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: It's gonna pay me on the back end.
**Speaker 2**: You got it?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: There is no.
**Speaker 2**: There's no H Vac.
**Speaker 2**: We got a plumbing number.
**Speaker 2**: We got an electrical number.
**Speaker 2**: We had a fence number, but they shit canned it because we didn't have to do that.
**Speaker 2**: They don't want to pay for a temp fence.
**Speaker 2**: And so it's really, it's very simple.
**Speaker 2**: Fire sprinkler?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: Electrical and plumbing.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Nothing for fire suppression in here.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Very good.
**Speaker 2**: It's all in the folder called Brandon's brain, evidently.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, well, now it's all that.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Doesn't.
**Jdawson**: I.
**Jdawson**: I don't have access to that one, Jesse.
**Speaker 2**: African dance songs or something.
**Speaker 2**: Seen him dancing in the airport the other day.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Oh, my gosh.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: I saw that too.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: That was funny.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: It's like, oh, my God, he's really getting down.
**Jdawson**: He's gonna read these meeting notes, Jesse.
**Speaker 2**: That's right.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: It looks like.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: It looks fun.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: I wanna.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: I wanna entourage when I show up for.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: You know, to foreign country.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Right.
**Speaker 2**: I've had one, but it was all policeman.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Right.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: That's the wrong kind of honor.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Those are.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Oh, God.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Yeah.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: In our estimate, in our estimated pricing, we had 31,000ft of pipe.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Of line pipe.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: So if I'm calculating 29,000.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: We're.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: We're good here on that.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: So.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: And we.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: We can sit.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: We called it 3 inch.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: We were pricing it at 3 inch.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: So that's also a benefit for us.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: So.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Anyway, sorry, I'm just looking up.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: Chris, send that email with what you're needing.
**Jdawson**: I need to get with the engineers on the spacing for the head 100 because we're not doing what happened here again.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: No, not at all.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: And yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I'd really like to set up a site visit.
**Jdawson**: Well, hell, it's literally on my way.
**Speaker 2**: You're in Pennsylvania, right?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: It's literally on the way to the airport.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: Stop in.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: So you're with international police or something?
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Interpol.
**Jdawson**: You're breaking.
**Jdawson**: You're breaking up, Jesse, what were you saying?
**Speaker 2**: Oh, I said, yeah, it's right there in New Jersey.
**Speaker 2**: So just stop by.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: All right.
**Speaker 2**: I'll get.
**Speaker 2**: I'll tell them.
**Speaker 2**: When would you be to go in.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: There.
**Speaker 2**: When they don't have.
**Jdawson**: Monday morning.
**Speaker 2**: I'll have to see if.
**Jdawson**: Monday morning.
**Speaker 2**: Monday morning.
**Jdawson**: Well, it depends.
**Jdawson**: I.
**Jdawson**: I don't know.
**Jdawson**: Let me see, because I.
**Jdawson**: I was looking.
**Jdawson**: Instead of flying into New Newark, what's the Harrisburg?
**Jdawson**: Harrisburg is way closer.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Park.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: What did you say it was in Paramus?
**Speaker 2**: Well, it's.
**Speaker 2**: The address is second.
**Jdawson**: Like 9000 or 900 something.
**Jdawson**: Sons.
**Speaker 2**: 9000 Rand Boulevard.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I saw it on something.
**Jdawson**: Find it.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Ran.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Ran the whole world trying to see if I could see it from New Jersey.
**Speaker 2**: New Jersey?
**Christopher.w.lopez**: I've never been to New Jersey.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: I have.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: I don't know if I'm missing much.
**Speaker 2**: It looks like they built these two giant warehouses right next to this little old town.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Holy Moses.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Why did they put the world's largest brick wall around this thing?
**Speaker 2**: Oh, what the hell?
**Christopher.w.lopez**: This is a data center.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Part data center.
**Speaker 2**: I don't know.
**Speaker 2**: It looks like there's four buildings there.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: This is a retaining wall that they used to level the ground.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: And I thought it was like a full scale.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Like what the hell.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: I'm trying to see if I can see like wall mounted pivs or anything.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Hey, we got that all done in Atlanta, Chris.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: That's good.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: They sign off.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I'm still waiting to hear from Lorenzo today.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: I don't see any, but I can't see very well.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: This is a very nice warehouse.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Very well landscaped.
**Speaker 2**: It's the Garden State, man.
**Speaker 2**: Everything's nice.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: That would be.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, yeah, it's the Garden State.
**Speaker 2**: It's like tons of farming there.
**Speaker 2**: Because I was.
**Speaker 2**: I did the job in Vineland, New Jersey, per the name.
**Speaker 2**: And it was all this bunch of vegetable garden like farms all over the place.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Huh.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Okay, so I got a good view of the side of this building now.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: I can look pretty much down both angles of it.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: They did not do exterior control valves.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: That's awesome.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: For you.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: That means, you know, that tells me.
**Jdawson**: Alex, say it again.
**Jdawson**: There's what exterior control valves.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: There is none on the perimeter of the building.
**Jdawson**: Ah.
**Jdawson**: So that means we just do butterfly valves or.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: So I may have lied to you.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: And all the risers are inside the pump room.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Kind of like.
**Jdawson**: Like, like Salt Lake City was.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Yeah, like Salt Lake City.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: And you might have to run a.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Run a distance, but that's not too bad.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: What we could do.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: And I wonder.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: I'd have to really think about that because I gotta.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: I was gonna say what you could do is run like a big.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: One big eight inch over there and then split it.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: But there is square footage requirements that technically that's one supply over 80, 000 square foot, which would be too much.
**Speaker 2**: But because of the weight we don't want to put in a bunch of structural supports.
**Speaker 2**: So that's why they got the smaller.
**Speaker 2**: Like they wanted to put in two separate smaller lines.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: No, I don't think because of the way.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: You wouldn't have to do too much structural.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: You wouldn't have to do it.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: You're only changing the rod size for spring up.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Spring sprinkler is not, not really that demanding on structures.
**Speaker 2**: Well, this one, yeah.
**Speaker 2**: They were going to make us beef up all the joists and add a bunch of crazy if anything was over.
**Speaker 2**: Because they originally had 6 inch lines shown.
**Jdawson**: And then we had to go through.
**Speaker 2**: A bunch of structural work for the, for the sprinkler mains.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Oh, is that why we.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Oh, I think we had that conversation about the 4 inch running.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Hey, I did a preliminary calc on this one.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: That's right.
**Speaker 2**: There's an Akase Thai restaurant right next door.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Someone gonna have diarrhea.
**Jdawson**: Not me.
**Jdawson**: I don't eat that.
**Speaker 2**: There's a Dunkin Donuts.
**Speaker 2**: I know you eat that.
**Jdawson**: Whoa, what are we saying here?
**Speaker 2**: Jesus.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: I mean, donuts?
**Speaker 2**: Everyone likes those things.
**Jdawson**: No, here.
**Jdawson**: It's the.
**Jdawson**: The closest restaurant's 25 minutes away.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Literally in Egypt.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Dude, that place sucks.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, this place is.
**Jdawson**: This place is horrible.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Like, there's nothing.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that's what I thought.
**Speaker 2**: This has all kinds of stuff.
**Speaker 2**: Popeyes, McDonald's.
**Jdawson**: Oh, so healthy.
**Speaker 2**: A Wawa right next door.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Oh, dude, a Wawa, bro.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: You get.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: You get.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: You get a tornado, you get robbed at the same time.
**Jdawson**: Tornadoes.
**Speaker 2**: Let's go.
**Speaker 2**: There's a chop shop.
**Speaker 2**: They'd advertise that.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Station hot dogs.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: It does look a little sketchy on that other side of the road there, over by the old.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: What is that?
**Jdawson**: Well, I'll find a Hampton Inn and I'll be fine.
**Speaker 2**: An Eagle.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: A flying Eagle.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Gas station.
**Jdawson**: Oh, yeah, that's Truck Stop.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Find a lot Lizard.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Oh, man.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: What you know about them?
**Jdawson**: Don't know much about them, Jess.
**Jdawson**: I got a little chuckle out of Jesse.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: All right, yep, I'll write this up.
**Jdawson**: All right, thanks.
**Speaker 2**: Please.
**Speaker 2**: All right.
**Speaker 2**: Thanks, Chris.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: No problem, guys.
**Speaker 2**: Thanks, Alex.
**Speaker 2**: See you.
**Speaker 2**: Bye.
