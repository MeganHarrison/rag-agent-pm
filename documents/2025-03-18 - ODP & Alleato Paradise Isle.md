## Transcript
**Gmarquez**: Morning, everyone.
**Gmarquez**: You guys hear me again?
**Dfattal**: How are you?
**Bclymer**: Morning, Danny.
**Gmarquez**: Good, good, good.
**Dfattal**: Hi.
**Gmarquez**: How are you guys doing today?
**Gmarquez**: Happy Tuesday.
**Gmarquez**: Well, Tuesday, fantastic.
**Gmarquez**: I'm a colleague of Danny's.
**Gmarquez**: I'm sure he's joining shortly.
**Gmarquez**: I'm one of the design principals here at odp.
**Speaker 3**: Hey, good morning, Gabriel.
**Gmarquez**: Gadiel.
**Gmarquez**: Gadiel.
**Bclymer**: How long have you worked with Danny?
**Gmarquez**: Man, wow.
**Gmarquez**: How long do you have for me to explain that?
**Gmarquez**: No.
**Gmarquez**: So I've been with ODP for seven years, so Danny's been a huge mentor to me as I, you know, when I first joined.
**Gmarquez**: And now we worked very, very closely.
**Gmarquez**: Me predominantly on.
**Gmarquez**: On the design side and him more on the.
**Gmarquez**: The technical side.
**Gmarquez**: So it's kind of a yin and yang relationship at the end of the day.
**Dfattal**: Really.
**Dfattal**: A mentor.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Gmarquez**: Yes.
**Dfattal**: You know, we.
**Bclymer**: We.
**Gmarquez**: We connected heavily over our.
**Gmarquez**: Our love for cars, and then it's, you know, been, you know, the story's kind of written itself ever since then.
**Speaker 3**: Good morning, guys.
**Speaker 3**: Sorry, I was on.
**Speaker 3**: I just.
**Speaker 3**: I didn't realize.
**Speaker 3**: I was on mute.
**Speaker 3**: And I'm just sitting here.
**Speaker 3**: I'm blushing, like, a little.
**Speaker 3**: Good morning, Brandon.
**Speaker 3**: Good morning, Jesse.
**Speaker 3**: Great to see you guys.
**Dfattal**: So.
**Speaker 3**: So I asked Gadiel to join us because, you know, as he mentioned, Gadiel and I work pretty much hand in hand when it comes to the design, and.
**Speaker 3**: And just, you know, what Jesse and I had a chance to talk about, and I just, you know, once again, thanks for sending it over, Brandon.
**Speaker 3**: You know, can you kind of just walk us through kind of what it is?
**Speaker 3**: Because from what Jesse said, it's like, was the package you guys sent over was more like an entitlement package.
**Speaker 3**: Somebody had kind of put together in a scheme and intent, and they were able to.
**Speaker 3**: To sell the parcel off that way.
**Speaker 3**: But, you know, just.
**Speaker 3**: If you could just sort of give us a history and just walk us through it.
**Dfattal**: Yeah.
**Dfattal**: So did you.
**Dfattal**: You got this, right?
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Dfattal**: Okay.
**Dfattal**: So, so basically what it is, is so one.
**Dfattal**: One of our clients asked us to, you know, do the master development for this parcel.
**Dfattal**: And there's one.
**Dfattal**: There's one main owner who's been building and, you know, developing for, you know, whatever, 50 years.
**Dfattal**: He's his 80s now, I think, or late 70s, one of the two.
**Dfattal**: And so, you know, he's got this parcel.
**Dfattal**: This is kind of his last hurrah, and he basically, he wants it to.
**Dfattal**: To.
**Dfattal**: To kind of leave an impact or, you know, have a vision.
**Dfattal**: Come place like, the money thing is not the driving factor for Him.
**Dfattal**: He's got the money.
**Dfattal**: And so our team basically got invited to the table.
**Dfattal**: It pitched to him like a month ago or so, and he liked it.
**Dfattal**: He's like, all right, cool.
**Dfattal**: Bring a team together.
**Dfattal**: Show me what you want to do.
**Dfattal**: Show your vision to me.
**Dfattal**: And, you know, let's.
**Dfattal**: Let's see.
**Dfattal**: You know, let's see if we can move this thing forward.
**Dfattal**: So these drawings and everything that you see are from, like, I don't know, 2017.
**Dfattal**: So it just dated.
**Dfattal**: This is from, like, a previous owner of the parcel.
**Dfattal**: They had these.
**Dfattal**: These drawings done.
**Dfattal**: And.
**Dfattal**: And so all the entitlements and everything are done for.
**Dfattal**: Let's see here.
**Dfattal**: So for this layout that they have right here.
**Dfattal**: So this is an existing golf course that hasn't been maintained.
**Dfattal**: So that would get spruced up, and then there's this existing marina that you saw, which is right here.
**Dfattal**: And so everything would essentially be done as far as the.
**Dfattal**: The earth moving, because that's in all the water and everything, because that's been done.
**Dfattal**: The biggest thing that.
**Dfattal**: That what we're looking at doing and what I want to bring to this meeting with this guy is, you know, taking that vision.
**Dfattal**: So right now, looking at this, it's very.
**Dfattal**: A lot of it's very dated.
**Dfattal**: It's very mid 2000s, in my opinion.
**Dfattal**: I think that having this hotel in the center like this versus taking it and putting it maybe like over here or something like that.
**Dfattal**: To where?
**Dfattal**: That way it's got waterfront.
**Dfattal**: It's also adjacent to the Gulf, so that people could go there.
**Speaker 3**: Parking lot and just put the building the way it is and just push it down towards the water and let the parking lot kind of be in the middle.
**Dfattal**: The parking garage here.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, just because, you know, it's like you have a parking garage in between the waterfront, almost.
**Speaker 3**: It just seems a little.
**Dfattal**: Yeah.
**Dfattal**: So the.
**Dfattal**: The actual.
**Dfattal**: So the.
**Dfattal**: This parking garage is on the back here.
**Dfattal**: So it's.
**Dfattal**: It's just the lagoon.
**Dfattal**: The actual waterfront is over here.
**Speaker 3**: Oh, I see.
**Speaker 3**: Got it.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Dfattal**: So.
**Dfattal**: So that's why.
**Dfattal**: I mean, you got to have it on the island for people to.
**Dfattal**: To park, obviously.
**Dfattal**: And so, you know, there's really.
**Dfattal**: I mean, you could maybe put it over here or something like that, but with the golf, you know, people are going to pull in here and then parking.
**Gmarquez**: So.
**Dfattal**: But.
**Dfattal**: But the hotel is definitely, I think, should be on the water either here or here.
**Dfattal**: I was thinking here.
**Dfattal**: That way it's adjacent to the golf course so that, you know, people can.
**Dfattal**: Can book here and Then also do a golf thing.
**Dfattal**: And then so the, the hotel also like when I'm again they have this as like an, it's very basic.
**Dfattal**: But what I envision is having a high end, like a signature type hotel.
**Dfattal**: Something that is I, I popping at least in, in, in our display to him to show him like something that like, hey, this is really nice and elegant because everything in here is just very bland and more about pro forma, you know, basic build to, to get cash flowing.
**Dfattal**: But what I want to do is I want to sell him on a vision and then, and then we can always, you know, once we get him bought in, it's, then it's, you know, we get to the numbers and detail everything out.
**Dfattal**: But I, I look at, I look at this elevation and stuff and the resort hotel like this, this looks like a basic hotel you would have on Panama City Beach.
**Dfattal**: Like it's nothing crazy, you know, but I think that we could make something extremely nice or at least show, show that and that way it's like, wow, that looks beautiful.
**Dfattal**: You know, I would love to have that as, as, you know, my last hurrah.
**Dfattal**: It's got my, you know, my, my stamp on it and whatnot.
**Dfattal**: And also, I mean with that, you know, this has got a connector here for the parking garage and everything.
**Dfattal**: You know, this isn't the hard rock.
**Dfattal**: Like I don't think the people that I envision staying here are not, they're valeting.
**Dfattal**: Like, it's not even like they're not worried about walking to their car like to save, to save 30 bucks a night in parking.
**Dfattal**: Like no, like they don't.
**Dfattal**: So that, that can be eliminated.
**Dfattal**: Again, this can be a very, I believe, high end, nice looking hotel that is the, the anchor point for the entire development.
**Gmarquez**: Okay, so that makes a lot of sense.
**Speaker 3**: So one of the questions that I have is, is, is is it more about a master planning and just meaning like there's not a performer or density you guys are just trying to hit.
**Speaker 3**: It's more about, you know, just curating a vision and a program for the entire site that seems to be cohesive and will work off of it off of itself.
**Speaker 3**: Right.
**Speaker 3**: There isn't really like a.
**Speaker 3**: Do we try to match the quantity units that we currently have or just being shown just as like a, like, just as a bod, just like a basis of design so that we're not providing less, but we're providing the same amount or what?
**Dfattal**: No, I don't, I don't think that's a.
**Dfattal**: Again, I Don't think like as far as the units go.
**Dfattal**: So if you look at the overall here, you know, the, the, the condos I think stay pretty much as is.
**Dfattal**: You know, these two condo units pretty much stay kind of as is.
**Dfattal**: You got all these town homes, blah, blah, blah.
**Dfattal**: Like none of that stuff is, is eye popping, moving, you know, something that people like.
**Dfattal**: This is, this is just roi.
**Dfattal**: That's all this stuff is like none of this stuff is like, oh my gosh, this is, you know, beautiful.
**Bclymer**: Right?
**Dfattal**: I think that all happens, you know, here on the main island.
**Dfattal**: And the reason I highlight the hotel is because, so we have to, you know, we have to go give a presentation and show him our, you know, the rest of this in a month.
**Dfattal**: And so we're limited on what we can do.
**Dfattal**: So I don't want to reinvent the wheel because you know, he, like we don't know, like we, we need to get buy in first.
**Dfattal**: I don't want to do stuff.
**Dfattal**: So it's like, all right, what is, what is the, the one or two things we can really focus on and highlight to move the needle and say like, wow, so like, you know, your, your, your boat lift and storage, like you're not going to do anything there.
**Dfattal**: Your, your mixed use buildings and stuff.
**Dfattal**: Like, okay, like it's still going to be pretty basic.
**Dfattal**: Not a ton of stuff you can do there.
**Dfattal**: I think your hotel and, and your, your golf club are, are two highlighted features that you could do stuff in.
**Dfattal**: Because what I'd like to do is, you know, one thing, but he's got all the, you've got all these renderings and everything and all this stuff.
**Dfattal**: But there's no video, like I'd like to have a video that, that shows, you know, a two minute video that he can see.
**Dfattal**: Like, oh wow, this looks so great.
**Dfattal**: I can actually see it.
**Dfattal**: And he doesn't have to have me in the room explaining it.
**Dfattal**: He can click on it, play later, he can send it to his friends, he can show his wife like all that stuff.
**Gmarquez**: Right.
**Speaker 3**: I'm just trying to write down, I'm just trying to get the program in my head.
**Speaker 3**: I mean right now it's going to be hotel, condo, townhomes, single family.
**Speaker 3**: Do you get.
**Speaker 3**: I mean, and then, and then there's the golf course component of it.
**Speaker 3**: So clubhouse.
**Speaker 3**: Is there, do you, is there any intent to have like a draw there?
**Speaker 3**: Like meaning other besides, you know, besides the guys, the people that are living there potentially.
**Bclymer**: Right?
**Speaker 3**: Is there a draw?
**Speaker 3**: Is there, is there like a want to create something where it's a pedestrian component where you're gonna have like restaurants, you're gonna have some retail.
**Dfattal**: Yes, absolutely, absolutely.
**Dfattal**: We're going to have again, you're going to have this, this is all kind of mixed use stuff.
**Dfattal**: So you're going to have restaurants and apartments and whatnot.
**Dfattal**: You know, right, right here.
**Dfattal**: This whole grass area I think is like we can definitely do something like a Sparkman here having like containers and a stage to where that's way more foot traffic friendly.
**Dfattal**: I think that you could, you know, eliminate this entire, this entire drive here to where you don't have it.
**Dfattal**: And so basically, you know, this is the main thoroughfare for vehicles and a lot of this is after that is parking essentially.
**Dfattal**: And it's all walking.
**Dfattal**: So you pull in and you can park in the parking garage.
**Dfattal**: You know, have the best way to get there is which would you know, I guess be here park.
**Dfattal**: But outside of that it's, it's walking.
**Dfattal**: It's not, you know, you're not driving over here and parking to go to whatever shop.
**Dfattal**: It's like you like this be a very foot traffic friendly area.
**Speaker 3**: Okay, go ahead.
**Gmarquez**: Sorry, Danny.
**Gmarquez**: Brandon, in an ideal world, you mentioned that you guys had a month before you had to get in front of, in, in front of this individual to kind of showcase the, the vision.
**Gmarquez**: What is in, in an ideal world, what is, what are you trying to show him and it.
**Gmarquez**: Are you just trying to show like one concept rendering?
**Gmarquez**: I know you mentioned an animation.
**Gmarquez**: You know, a month is a, a very, very aggressive.
**Dfattal**: Right, well that's the thing.
**Dfattal**: So we need to back into like all right, what can we accomplish in a month?
**Bclymer**: Right?
**Dfattal**: So is that like, hey, all we can do is take this layout and I've got all these actual DWG design files too.
**Dfattal**: So we're not starting from scratch, but is it taking, taking this and reworking it so we have an aerial and then it's taking you know, one building like the hotel and creating something and then having you know, some really cool like here's what the, the pool looks like and, and everything.
**Dfattal**: Like they kind of have some stuff up here but you know, even more detailed and elegant like.
**Dfattal**: So that's the question and kind of why I asked Jesse to you know, get you guys on the horn here.
**Dfattal**: I want to figure out what we can even do because I, at, at 10:00 I'm getting on a phone call with the partners to say here's our plan of action.
**Speaker 3**: I.
**Speaker 3**: If I'm assuming gaddy it would be us just focusing on this parcel or this like just this island, let's call it, leaving everything else to be.
**Speaker 3**: Right.
**Speaker 3**: I'm.
**Speaker 3**: I'm thinking probably in the, in.
**Speaker 3**: In the massing scheme just to be able to.
**Speaker 3**: To curate it.
**Speaker 3**: Right.
**Gmarquez**: So.
**Gmarquez**: So, yeah, so.
**Gmarquez**: So that's kind of the, that's sort of the, the bit.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Gmarquez**: Like I think for.
**Gmarquez**: And, and let's just use the month for, for sake of the argument.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Gmarquez**: As the baseline.
**Gmarquez**: You know, in a month.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Gmarquez**: We would want to try to, you know, basically model this thing out and then focus on the hotel being off of the lagoon side.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Gmarquez**: Opposed to, you know, that, that parking being there.
**Gmarquez**: I think having the proximity to the golf club makes all the sense in the world.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Gmarquez**: Easy, you know, back and forth traffic, etc.
**Gmarquez**: Etc.
**Gmarquez**: But if you wanted to show him a vision, you would want to have some sort of facade concept on that hotel.
**Gmarquez**: You know, almost like if you were.
**Gmarquez**: If you zoomed out a little bit, Brandon, and.
**Gmarquez**: Or if you went to the kind of.
**Gmarquez**: The overall plan, it don't.
**Gmarquez**: It's.
**Gmarquez**: Yeah, you would want to kind of show that.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Gmarquez**: And we would want to focus, focus the, you know, the shot where it's kind of maybe coming from the golf club looking at the island where you get the water, but you know, something like that again.
**Gmarquez**: Yeah, some.
**Gmarquez**: Exactly.
**Gmarquez**: Something like that.
**Gmarquez**: You know, a little bit, you know, a little bit elevated, you know, maybe a little, A little bit more down from where this vantage point is.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Gmarquez**: But it would take us, you know, and we're pretty aggressive with how we approach things.
**Gmarquez**: You know, it would take us a minimum of, you know, two to three weeks just to get something solid from a concept facade standpoint.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Gmarquez**: And then you have to think about the rendering time and putting together a package.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Gmarquez**: You know, just to be completely transparent with you guys, an animation would.
**Gmarquez**: Would not be in.
**Gmarquez**: In the works for this.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Gmarquez**: But maybe one or two stills really just focusing on.
**Gmarquez**: On the hotel component and its relationship to the golf course.
**Gmarquez**: Even then I just don't want to over promise and under deliver.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Dfattal**: So let's be like, all right, anime.
**Dfattal**: Can't do the video, can't do this, can't do that.
**Dfattal**: Let's start with what can be done.
**Gmarquez**: I would want one, you know, one or two kind of hero shots focusing on.
**Gmarquez**: On a hotel concept, you know, and kind of designing the hotel and trying to, you know, everything else kind of just bleeds away.
**Gmarquez**: As in terms of massing what's a.
**Dfattal**: What's a here.
**Dfattal**: I'm sorry, what's a hero shot?
**Gmarquez**: Sorry.
**Gmarquez**: So hero shot would be like the, the rendering that, you know, drives a lot of emotion, right?
**Gmarquez**: It's just like that one main rendering that, that sells the project, if you will.
**Speaker 3**: It's, you're trying, you're trying to get the best.
**Speaker 3**: It's, it's, it's like saying, okay, fine, I, I have three, I have three potential images that I can, that we can, we can agree to sit there and say these are the ones that we want to focus on, right?
**Speaker 3**: To Gaudio's, you know, point would be one perspective, the entire site, another one that, that picks up the most cues and just really tries to sell the point.
**Speaker 3**: And then like a third just to be able to get the pedestrian feel, for example.
**Speaker 3**: And those are going to be the big stills to be able to elaborate all the detailing and the feel and be able to elaborate on the, you know, what we're trying to get across with intent, be their design, you know, aesthetics, you know, intent, or just trying to sell the, hopefully try to sell the vision and being able to focus on those.
**Speaker 3**: To be able to put together a full package with regards to at least massing for everything.
**Speaker 3**: And then to Gaudio's point, it's just, you know, picking which ones are really the big crucial ones to be able to detail or be able to get like a real skin on, right?
**Speaker 3**: Because everything is still imaginary in a certain point.
**Speaker 3**: But to be able to get across the, the fit and the finish, right, like the difference between like a beach club style resort versus let's say like a water street component.
**Speaker 3**: Both of them have their, their time and place, but it's like what are you trying, what are we trying to do?
**Speaker 3**: And the examples I've used with Jesse is like, you know, you have, you have good examples like Midtown, like Gasworks and Ybor, Water street, even Miami World Center.
**Speaker 3**: Like there's a lot of these projects that are being done right now where, where it's, it's really trying to be a pull for like the live, live work, play component of it.
**Speaker 3**: Meaning that you're going to be, if you're going to be retiring here, then you're going to have certain amenities versus in a fit and finish compared to more of a younger generational vibe where you're trying to get, you know, 30, the 30, the beginning 30 year old guys and then the 55 guys being able to commingle in a spot.
**Speaker 3**: And that's, I mean, and it's just, it's and once again, it's more the driver behind that, Brandon, is just how big of a site it is.
**Speaker 3**: You know, that's the only holdback.
**Dfattal**: Danny, do you have it Or Gabrielle, do you have any, like, renderings you've done of other projects similar.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, I can pull something up if you give me a second.
**Speaker 3**: Where's.
**Speaker 3**: Let me go now.
**Speaker 3**: Actually, I think I only have like.
**Bclymer**: 260 acres to work with.
**Gmarquez**: Yeah.
**Dfattal**: I love that.
**Speaker 3**: Gosh.
**Speaker 3**: Natalie just sent this to me and now I have it on my.
**Speaker 3**: Did this one here?
**Speaker 3**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: So can I share my screen?
**Speaker 3**: Yep.
**Speaker 3**: Here, here.
**Speaker 3**: Where the hell is.
**Speaker 3**: Oh, here we go up.
**Dfattal**: Right?
**Speaker 3**: I know it's every.
**Speaker 3**: It's between Zoom, Google Meet teams.
**Speaker 3**: We have a bunch of them.
**Speaker 3**: Just do entire screen.
**Speaker 3**: I'm just going to pick the screen.
**Speaker 3**: No, I'm going to pick the screen.
**Speaker 3**: Share.
**Speaker 3**: Okay.
**Speaker 3**: Can you see my screen?
**Dfattal**: Yep.
**Speaker 3**: Okay.
**Speaker 3**: So this is a real image.
**Speaker 3**: This is a real image.
**Speaker 3**: These two are renderings.
**Speaker 3**: Right.
**Speaker 3**: And what we've done in the past is that we create these renderings to really try to give the full intent of it.
**Speaker 3**: So, like in this one, it's just the tower, but you get that.
**Speaker 3**: That shot of everything on the, you know, on the pedestrian component we've done.
**Speaker 3**: These are just master plans that we've done.
**Speaker 3**: So this is Miami World center, for example, the Four Seasons Resort, which is the one that we're doing currently under construction.
**Speaker 3**: And in Naples, it's.
**Speaker 3**: This is kind of the same concept, but that's more of a beach resort kind of vibe.
**Speaker 3**: This is both hotel and residences.
**Speaker 3**: This is a good one.
**Speaker 3**: Shops at Sunset Place and then Mercedes Benz.
**Speaker 3**: But this is a good example of being able to try to do that aerial, to be able to really show the entire site.
**Speaker 3**: And this is a rendering.
**Speaker 3**: It's a, you know, we try to get to a photorealistic.
**Speaker 3**: This is another good example of being able to try to show both the architecture and intent of the building.
**Speaker 3**: But you really get that feel of what we're trying to curate or that vision with regards to the.
**Speaker 3**: That mixed use.
**Speaker 3**: You know, you have your residences on top and then you have that retail pedestrian component on the bottom.
**Speaker 3**: These are interiors, I think.
**Speaker 3**: Does that help A little bit.
**Speaker 3**: I can find more if you guys need.
**Speaker 3**: Yes.
**Gmarquez**: Hello.
**Dfattal**: Dope.
**Dfattal**: Yeah.
**Dfattal**: So that.
**Dfattal**: So what up?
**Dfattal**: This picture right here that I'm looking at the rendering on the left.
**Dfattal**: Rendering next to it.
**Dfattal**: An actual construction, correct?
**Speaker 3**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Speaker 3**: Okay.
**Dfattal**: And then on the right, the Apple one, is that a rendering as well?
**Speaker 3**: No, that's a real photo.
**Dfattal**: But yeah, so.
**Dfattal**: So.
**Dfattal**: So you're thinking kind of like they have a view similar looking in the deck, looking from the golf course, kind of straight at the golf club.
**Dfattal**: And so you're thinking coming from an angle, we would have one view showing.
**Dfattal**: Here's the hotel.
**Dfattal**: The golf club.
**Dfattal**: Right.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, exactly.
**Speaker 3**: So in the same vein, where, you know, where these guys, they have those cam positions, right?
**Speaker 3**: Cam 7, 10.
**Speaker 3**: Cam 11.
**Dfattal**: So I.
**Dfattal**: Cam 11, right.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, we would just.
**Speaker 3**: We would just pick.
**Speaker 3**: Sorry, we would just pick a better view to be able.
**Speaker 3**: Because these.
**Speaker 3**: Because these are just very rudimentary.
**Speaker 3**: Just like, here's the layout and plan, and then this is what the exterior looks out looks like.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Speaker 3**: Like, it doesn't really give you much of an idea of how, you know, these.
**Speaker 3**: These images are kind of what we think of as, like, hero shots where you're really getting a good idea of how everything is curated.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Speaker 3**: Just not in sketchup form.
**Speaker 3**: It's an actual real rendering.
**Gmarquez**: Danny, can I share my screen real fast?
**Dfattal**: Danny said go to that Cam 11, I think is what.
**Speaker 3**: Which one was that label?
**Dfattal**: No, just keep going.
**Dfattal**: One more.
**Speaker 3**: See, like, this is a good shot.
**Speaker 3**: Like, this is a good shot to be able to give you that feel of the boats, give you that feel of the park, you know, your little landmark you have here.
**Speaker 3**: And then a feel of what the architecture is.
**Speaker 3**: But you're not seeing the other buildings, for example.
**Speaker 3**: Right.
**Speaker 3**: It's.
**Speaker 3**: We just.
**Speaker 3**: We're just very accurate.
**Speaker 3**: We're just very specific about what we're trying to showcase without having to put too much, you know, effort in regards to, like, detailing aesthetic and everything else into every single thing, but getting the idea, you know, feel.
**Dfattal**: So that's the one.
**Dfattal**: That's camera 11.
**Dfattal**: So this is the view of the golf club.
**Dfattal**: There's the back of the parking garage.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Dfattal**: And so we're thinking that.
**Dfattal**: But just to the left.
**Speaker 3**: Exactly.
**Dfattal**: Or.
**Dfattal**: Or whatever.
**Speaker 3**: Whatever we agree upon.
**Speaker 3**: Right.
**Speaker 3**: That's.
**Gmarquez**: So.
**Gmarquez**: So.
**Gmarquez**: So, for example, if we were to.
**Speaker 3**: I stopped sharing, actually.
**Gmarquez**: Can't.
**Gmarquez**: Okay, we'll come back to that in a second, but.
**Speaker 3**: Sorry.
**Gmarquez**: Can you guys see my screen?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Gmarquez**: So this is a rendering with an actual drone shot.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Gmarquez**: But nonetheless, this one is fully rendered.
**Gmarquez**: So our rendering team basically modeled these buildings in so and so forth.
**Gmarquez**: And then this was a shot.
**Gmarquez**: So let's just focus on this one.
**Gmarquez**: For example, imagine if we went to camera view 11 and we only wanted to show that shot.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Gmarquez**: Well, there's plus or minus three buildings that are visible with some landscape.
**Gmarquez**: Landscape.
**Gmarquez**: You know, we could focus on those three buildings in terms of the facades that are being viewed.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Gmarquez**: And so let's just say they're, you know, plus or minus six facades total.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Gmarquez**: We could, you know, basically focus on those.
**Gmarquez**: And it sounds.
**Gmarquez**: It sounds silly, but we could focus on those six facades, build the scene, and then we could try to supplement that with some updated, you know, site plan graphics.
**Bclymer**: Right, where we're, you know, we're.
**Gmarquez**: We're re highlighting some of the massing strategies and things like that.
**Gmarquez**: We could talk about the circulation and the parking.
**Gmarquez**: But it, you know, from an imagery standpoint, you would get, you know, for example, one image here, and then we would supplement it with just some revised graphics of the overall site plan.
**Gmarquez**: And, and, and just kind of preface that, like, hey, this is a moment in time.
**Gmarquez**: This is where the vision is leading.
**Gmarquez**: And, you know, it'll just take a little, you know, some more time to be able to further develop it and get you shots and elevations and plans of all of the different components that we just haven't explored yet.
**Gmarquez**: Does that make sense?
**Dfattal**: So.
**Dfattal**: All right, so I understand what time constraints allow us to do.
**Dfattal**: So I told you kind of what my thoughts were, my ideas looking at it, but, you know, I'm just sticks and bricks at the end of the day.
**Dfattal**: You guys are, you know, designers.
**Dfattal**: So, like, I guess looking at it from your lens, like, did you guys have some ideas off the get go or some thoughts or like, you know, what is something that, if anything, you guys would change or do or think about the.
**Speaker 3**: And I can speak on the.
**Speaker 3**: That a little bit gaddy.
**Speaker 3**: Oh, if you don't mind, go for it.
**Speaker 3**: So what I was, you know, in talking with Jesse and just kind of getting a better understanding.
**Speaker 3**: I.
**Speaker 3**: Right now, what we're looking at, meaning, like, what's in that package is something.
**Speaker 3**: It's a moment in time.
**Speaker 3**: Right.
**Speaker 3**: Like, I think, Brandon, to your point, it's just a little bit outdated.
**Speaker 3**: It was, it was, it was, you know, it was in Vogue about 20, you know, about a decade or two ago.
**Speaker 3**: So I think the biggest thing is that we probably just change the language of the buildings that are there, meaning get them to be a little bit more exciting, a little bit more of a draw, a little bit more of a live work.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Speaker 3**: Like for the people that when they come home to the community, they're there for.
**Speaker 3**: To be there.
**Speaker 3**: And then they can eat, they can go shopping, they can do whatever, they can go to the park, they can get some exercise, so on and so forth.
**Speaker 3**: Right.
**Speaker 3**: I think that's the, the biggest draw.
**Speaker 3**: I think that's going to be viable for you guys, especially in that area, because it's going to be something that is going to be a magnet not only for the residents in the community, but also for other people getting drawn into it.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Speaker 3**: And then that's how it starts to get activated.
**Speaker 3**: So I've always sort of, I've always envisioned it more of a, of a little bit more modern touch, but not to the point where it's like, you know, ACM panels and everything else, but give it something a little bit more in the D.C.
**Speaker 3**: kind of vibe and feel.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Speaker 3**: Where you kind of have low rise, 12 story buildings, but you have a very pedestrian feel to it.
**Speaker 3**: The, the.
**Speaker 3**: If we were just focusing on the island and the island alone, I think that we can repurpose some of those, that, that space and just kind of shuffle things around a little bit to try to do that.
**Speaker 3**: And I think that's going to be the big draw.
**Speaker 3**: The golf course is its own draw.
**Speaker 3**: The single family homes, the townhomes, that's its own thing.
**Speaker 3**: Right.
**Speaker 3**: But the, that whole area, I think we want to try to rework accordingly.
**Speaker 3**: The other thing that I thought about was the approach, you know, with, with the client about the land itself.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Speaker 3**: And I mean that in the sense of, you know, for like the Miami World center structure, meaning the way that it was put together.
**Speaker 3**: Miami World center is a big mass development down in Miami downtown.
**Speaker 3**: There was one developer entity that basically purchased all the parcels.
**Speaker 3**: But what he ended up doing is they took one or two buildings for themselves and then sold the other blocks and parcels to other developers to do their own thing.
**Speaker 3**: So for example, like for the townhomes and for the single family homes, maybe that's where you try to introduce the component of saying, like, we're going to sell these parcels off to like a Lennar or Dr.
**Speaker 3**: Horton or whatever.
**Dfattal**: Those single, those single family homes are existing.
**Speaker 3**: Oh, they're existing.
**Speaker 3**: Even the townhomes are existing and everything else.
**Dfattal**: No, the townhomes are new.
**Dfattal**: But if you look at that, that plan, it calls out what's existing.
**Dfattal**: Like, so like in the golf course, those single family homes are all existing.
**Speaker 3**: Got it.
**Speaker 3**: Okay.
**Speaker 3**: I did not pick up on that.
**Speaker 3**: I apologize.
**Speaker 3**: So, okay, so then the single family homes is their own thing and everything else.
**Speaker 3**: So then it's just, you know, curating this to be a little bit more fun and a little bit more entertaining and you know, just Trying to, to, to curate it accordingly.
**Speaker 3**: Right now I just have my in.
**Speaker 3**: My assumption is that we're just going to replace the buildings with what's there now, but just with a little bit of different style and a little different juxtaposition.
**Speaker 3**: But I don't think you're going to want to be adding any more buildings unless you think we can.
**Speaker 3**: Unless you want to try to push that meaning.
**Speaker 3**: You know, maybe it's.
**Dfattal**: I don't think at this juncture adding more building necessarily is, is, is in the cards.
**Dfattal**: You know, again, I think, I think, you know, adding more buildings is more of a production like how can we maximize roi?
**Dfattal**: And, and you only would add more buildings to generate more revenue if your revenue point is lower.
**Dfattal**: My thought in theory is raise the revenue point to where you don't have to have as many buildings because the amount per patron is double what it would be in a lower quality or lower income demographic.
**Speaker 3**: Fair.
**Speaker 3**: What are your.
**Dfattal**: Anybody, any, anybody can go make something that's going to cater to, you know, the, the middle, upper middle class.
**Dfattal**: The middle class.
**Dfattal**: Your, your 100 to $150,000 household income.
**Dfattal**: Like anybody can go make those.
**Dfattal**: And that's great.
**Dfattal**: I don't know how much that.
**Speaker 3**: Well, maybe that's a good.
**Speaker 3**: What do you think?
**Dfattal**: Something that's like.
**Dfattal**: Go ahead.
**Speaker 3**: What, what are you thinking?
**Speaker 3**: Your buy square foot would be your sellable square foot.
**Speaker 3**: What are you shooting?
**Dfattal**: I'm not, not thinking, I'm not thinking numbers at all.
**Dfattal**: I'm thinking, I'm thinking what can I put in front of this guy where he's gonna say that looks badass like to where he doesn't, to where he doesn't think because the numbers are a year away.
**Dfattal**: Right.
**Dfattal**: So I mean the first thing is like getting buy in and then we can, you know, value engineer it and, and get it down to where it needs to be to make, to make sense business wise.
**Speaker 3**: But the main reason, yeah, the only reason I'm asking that is that sometimes like we have clients that sit there and they say I'm going to sell it for 700 a square or I'm going to try to sell it for 500 a square.
**Speaker 3**: And we can with that it helps us just what we're trying to do.
**Speaker 3**: But if it's just trying to just really get across a vision, it sounds like more than anything else, it's just really what.
**Speaker 3**: Like if it was, you know, carte blanche and we got this, you know, the clean slate, what could we put on here that really just Makes the guy go, that's pretty cool.
**Speaker 3**: I want to build this.
**Dfattal**: Exactly, exactly.
**Dfattal**: Because at the end of the day, I mean, this guy gets approached by different developers all the damn time and it's fine.
**Dfattal**: But you know, in my opinion, they all approach with stuff like this.
**Dfattal**: It's numbers geared, things like that.
**Dfattal**: Like, he's not probably going to be able to buy by the time this thing is done.
**Dfattal**: And so the thought process that I want to go into it with and just, and the information that we've learned and we know about and, and kind of what his thoughts and feelings are is.
**Dfattal**: All right, well, we need to go in there to where he's like, man, I want my name on that.
**Dfattal**: Like, that looks so cool, right?
**Speaker 3**: Claudia, what are you, what are your thoughts?
**Gmarquez**: Listen, I, I, I buy into everything that you're saying, Brendan.
**Gmarquez**: My, my, my only, the only flag is, is, is the timeline, right?
**Gmarquez**: So like, if there's, you know, any sort of wiggle room on, on that month to, you know, like, ideally this would be, you know, eight weeks, right?
**Gmarquez**: And then I would have, you know, a little, I would have more content, I would have more time to develop more content across the entire board.
**Bclymer**: Right?
**Gmarquez**: So the four weeks is, is really aggressive.
**Gmarquez**: So that, that's my only, that's the only gripe I have with this entire conversation.
**Bclymer**: Right?
**Gmarquez**: And, and that's, that's nobody's, that's nobody's.
**Dfattal**: He wanted to, he wanted to meet this week.
**Dfattal**: So.
**Dfattal**: Oh my God.
**Speaker 3**: I think, look, I think I, I.
**Dfattal**: I had to put my foot down, be like, like I can't, like I can't go in there with anything in, you know, in a week.
**Dfattal**: Like, I got like I need a, I need a month to actually do so.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: So here's, here's the way I would, I would, I would see this going down.
**Speaker 3**: We would, we would need to at least put together, you know, the very first step would be amassing.
**Speaker 3**: Meaning how do we think this lays out?
**Speaker 3**: Get the, get the build, you know, the form onto, onto the site and see what makes sense and work through that process and then agree on the, the layout.
**Speaker 3**: And then once that's accounted for, I think we should be able to try to be able to gaudyl is like we pick the ski, we pick the scenes that we want and we just, just focus on what's visible in the scenes to be able to help because the massing will be able to define location, we will define height and we'll be able to define, you know, be the space Being occupied and being able to see what the layout is.
**Speaker 3**: And then we just really focus on the specifics to be able to try to get that, that, that, that point across and then hopefully that will let us.
**Speaker 3**: The idea would be, you know, just talking out loud is that, hey, in a month this is kind of where we're at.
**Speaker 3**: Let us know your comments and everything else and see if we can, you know, try to get, Yeah, I mean.
**Dfattal**: That'S, that's my thought is like, here's what we did.
**Dfattal**: Very limited information in a short time frame.
**Dfattal**: You know, what are your thoughts?
**Dfattal**: Like exactly this, like, let's keep going or please.
**Dfattal**: Yeah, my office.
**Speaker 3**: That's it.
**Speaker 3**: You're muted, man.
**Dfattal**: No, so, yeah, so the, what he's saying is, dude, I've got all the CAD files for this.
**Dfattal**: Does that help you at all?
**Speaker 3**: Yes, please.
**Speaker 3**: The survey site, everything.
**Speaker 3**: Just so that we can, you know, get it into the model and be able to work off of it and then, you know, we can go from there.
**Dfattal**: Does that, how does that affect the time?
**Dfattal**: Yeah, how does that affect the timeline?
**Dfattal**: Now all of a sudden is, you know, now it's all feasible.
**Speaker 3**: No.
**Dfattal**: I don't like, I don't like.
**Gmarquez**: Hey man, I'm gonna be super, super honest with you guys.
**Gmarquez**: Listen, I, I, me and my team, me and my team do a lot of crazy things, but I, I, I, I don't wanna.
**Speaker 3**: You'Re coming in and out, Brandon.
**Speaker 3**: Like it's, it's, it's hard to hear you.
**Dfattal**: I'm not saying anything.
**Speaker 3**: Oh, okay, okay.
**Gmarquez**: I, I, listen, I, I, I, I, I don't want to, I just can't over promise and under deliver.
**Gmarquez**: It's just not how, it's not how I operate.
**Gmarquez**: So when, when you tell me you want something that's gonna wow, you guys, I'm gonna work, you know, day and night to get there, but it's just, I just gotta be realistic with you.
**Gmarquez**: I think this is a super candid conversation.
**Gmarquez**: So it doesn't affect the timeline.
**Gmarquez**: It makes things easier for sure.
**Gmarquez**: Yes, I appreciate that, but it's still aspects of, you know, digesting it all.
**Gmarquez**: You know, there are some things that we're going to want to, you know, obviously change, right?
**Gmarquez**: Like even from its park location, the way it kind of bleeds closer to that multi, multi family unit and just recreating, you know, graphics to, you know, to get this across the finish line.
**Gmarquez**: But you know, listen, if we can, if we could focus on, for example, again, you know, I think it was view 10 camera angle 10, right?
**Gmarquez**: Or 11, whatever it was, and we can start to work off of that.
**Gmarquez**: That is a step in the right direction, I think.
**Gmarquez**: You know, understanding if from.
**Gmarquez**: From.
**Gmarquez**: To Danny's point, amassing from a massing perspective, you know, are those heights, you know, concrete, Right.
**Bclymer**: Or.
**Gmarquez**: Or do they have flexibility in some of the renderings, I saw some taller buildings.
**Gmarquez**: Do we have the ability to.
**Gmarquez**: To.
**Gmarquez**: To go taller?
**Gmarquez**: Do we want to stay on that kind of, you know, low rise for the hotel?
**Gmarquez**: You know, it's maybe some of those things also are.
**Gmarquez**: Are, you know, are things that we would want to know very, very quickly.
**Bclymer**: Right?
**Gmarquez**: And then, you know, lastly, I know it's selling the vision to.
**Gmarquez**: To.
**Gmarquez**: To.
**Gmarquez**: To this guy, but, you know, you guys, I assume, also have a vision from an architectural language, right?
**Gmarquez**: That you guys also want to be able to kind of push forward onto the site.
**Gmarquez**: So, like, what is that language?
**Gmarquez**: Is, Is it.
**Gmarquez**: Is it similar to, you know, what happened or what's been designed over at Water Street?
**Bclymer**: Right?
**Gmarquez**: Is it something completely different?
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Gmarquez**: Like, I think the images that we see now, just like you said, it was like early 2000s, definitely an outdated approach.
**Gmarquez**: So, you know, how modern or how contemporary do you want to get with some of those things and understanding, you know, that architectural language, that actually saves me a lot of time.
**Bclymer**: Right?
**Gmarquez**: Because then it lets me and my team think about it in the right, you know, in the right light.
**Gmarquez**: So, you know, those are just my, My initial takes.
**Gmarquez**: But I mean, hey, Danny and I are always up for a challenge, but I'm just being super transparent with you guys from.
**Gmarquez**: From the get go.
**Dfattal**: Yeah, no, I'm just busting your balls.
**Gmarquez**: So.
**Dfattal**: But thanks.
**Dfattal**: So.
**Dfattal**: All right, so I guess we gotta jump on this next call, but.
**Dfattal**: All right, so you guys.
**Dfattal**: So as far as the.
**Dfattal**: The look, the elevation.
**Dfattal**: So I'll bring that up in this in our next call with all the owner.
**Dfattal**: All the owners.
**Dfattal**: My first thought, initial thought is.
**Dfattal**: Is very similar to the water street as far as, like the greenery and things like that, like where you have it on the building and stuff like that versus right here.
**Dfattal**: The way this looks is very, very beachy and very, again, mid 2000s.
**Dfattal**: But I think if you encompass that modern with the.
**Dfattal**: With the greenery and making it look like very.
**Dfattal**: I don't know what that word is called, but I think you understand what I'm saying.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I got you.
**Speaker 3**: I know exactly the.
**Speaker 3**: The feel you guys are, what you're asking for.
**Speaker 3**: It's like urban elegance.
**Speaker 3**: It's like, well, it's like an urban sort of.
**Speaker 3**: It's like an urban new something.
**Speaker 3**: I, I can't find the word for it.
**Speaker 3**: But what is the actual date that you guys like?
**Speaker 3**: What's like the actual.
**Speaker 3**: What's the date?
**Speaker 3**: Can we just, can we, can we pick a date of when you.
**Dfattal**: Probably.
**Dfattal**: I'll probably have.
**Dfattal**: I'll probably have that in the next 40 minutes.
**Dfattal**: Okay.
**Dfattal**: When I meet with the rest of them.
**Dfattal**: Because I, I.
**Dfattal**: That everybody's got.
**Dfattal**: I mean, obviously there's a ton going on, so every, every.
**Dfattal**: The owners and different partners have their own.
**Dfattal**: Our, Our job was to figure out design.
**Dfattal**: What can we do, what can we deliver in, you know, roughly a month?
**Dfattal**: And so we'll find out a lot more information in the next hour and we'll share what we have with you from there.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Dfattal**: Yeah, perfect.
**Speaker 3**: Jesse, Brandon, if you guys can send us the CAD files so we can, we can jump on it and then thanks again for the, you know, the opportunity.
**Speaker 3**: I'm hoping we can you have a.
**Bclymer**: Proposal or, like, how much is it for, like.
**Speaker 3**: So gaddyo.
**Speaker 3**: I mean, what are you thinking?
**Speaker 3**: Just.
**Gmarquez**: I will.
**Gmarquez**: So are we talking about just doing this exercise?
**Gmarquez**: Are we talking about the proposal for the full scope of the project, assuming that we would, you know, be awarded the project if it were to move forward?
**Dfattal**: I would say probably just for this.
**Dfattal**: I mean, our, our thought and our, our goal is we would, we would want to use you guys.
**Dfattal**: That's, that's why we brought you guys into it for the, the entire thing.
**Dfattal**: Or at least, I mean, this thing is.
**Dfattal**: I say the entire thing.
**Dfattal**: This is, in reality, this is not going to be designed at once.
**Dfattal**: This will be designed in phases.
**Dfattal**: But that would be.
**Dfattal**: The goal is like, you know, hey, phase one, odp, you know, using you guys for the architectural.
**Dfattal**: Probably end up using.
**Dfattal**: This guy has a relationship with them.
**Dfattal**: He likes them.
**Dfattal**: We're not going to rock that boat.
**Dfattal**: But yeah, that would, that's our intent.
**Dfattal**: That's what, that's why we gave you a shout.
**Dfattal**: Okay.
**Gmarquez**: Understood.
**Dfattal**: Yeah.
**Gmarquez**: Let me, Let me.
**Gmarquez**: If you can send us over the CAT files, let me and Danny get on, you know, offline together, and then we'll come up with something that's.
**Gmarquez**: It's reasonable for you guys for, for the month duration.
**Gmarquez**: But.
**Gmarquez**: And then from, you know, we'll send it back over to you guys for review and, and, you know, you let us know if it, if it pencils out.
**Dfattal**: Awesome.
**Dfattal**: Sounds good.
**Dfattal**: I'll send over the, the link for the files.
**Speaker 3**: Awesome.
**Speaker 3**: Thank you, guys.
**Speaker 3**: We'll talk.
**Dfattal**: Appreciate it.
**Speaker 3**: All right, thanks, guys.
**Speaker 3**: Bye.
