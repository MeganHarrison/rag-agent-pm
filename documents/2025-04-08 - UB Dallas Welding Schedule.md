## Transcript
**Ataylor**: Hey, Drew.
**Sglaze**: Steve.
**Shooper**: Good afternoon.
**Sglaze**: Hey.
**Sglaze**: I totally forgot that we had this meeting, and I left to grab lunch and go back to the hotel because the guys were wrapping up for the day, and so I'm not actually on site.
**Sglaze**: Did you need me to be on site with Scott?
**Ataylor**: No, I don't think so.
**Shooper**: Okay.
**Sglaze**: Because I'm.
**Sglaze**: I just.
**Sglaze**: I just had to extend my stay.
**Sglaze**: I'm staying tomorrow, too, so we can look at stuff tomorrow as well.
**Shooper**: Oh.
**Ataylor**: So AJ Talked a little bit yesterday.
**Ataylor**: Were you able to get with Homestead?
**Sglaze**: Yep.
**Sglaze**: We are on track for starting the 21st.
**Ataylor**: Awesome.
**Ataylor**: I want to go through this schedule again, and I think we kind of put on this pretty well when we were on site three weeks ago, as far as how many days we think we'll be in each area.
**Ataylor**: And I know you had a drawing, A.J.
**Ataylor**: that you were putting some dates into, I think.
**Ataylor**: Do you still have that?
**Sglaze**: Not with me, but it's in a folder at my office back home, So I will type that up and send it to you, Drew.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: What I want to put together, I guess, and.
**Ataylor**: Or give to Ulta tomorrow.
**Ataylor**: Michael's got a meeting with his operations team at some point tomorrow, so I'm trying to give him this schedule before he goes into that.
**Sglaze**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: He wants to at least give it to him a week and a half.
**Ataylor**: He wanted it, you know, last week, but it was just a quick turnaround by the time we got the decision from to go with Homestead.
**Ataylor**: So I don't even know what.
**Ataylor**: Steve, do you have a drawing of something that we could look at?
**Ataylor**: Do you want me to do that one that you bubbled in or AJ if you've got one.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, I got something up here.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: So I think, you know, mobilize the 21st, AJ we've got.
**Ataylor**: I think it's one night of discovery.
**Ataylor**: I know you got up in a lift and looked at it a little bit.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: I'm nervous to say we're going to take two days of discovery.
**Ataylor**: If.
**Ataylor**: If we've got one night where we're.
**Ataylor**: We've got it all wrapped up, and then they want to start welding the second day.
**Ataylor**: I'd rather, you know, tell them we've got one night of discovery, and then if they end up doing two nights of discovery, that's fine, but, yeah, I'm fine with that.
**Ataylor**: So Monday, the 21st.
**Ataylor**: That night we've got discovery.
**Ataylor**: Tuesday, Wednesday, this inbound area.
**Ataylor**: I think we said this would be fine for two nights, right, A.J.
**Sglaze**: Yeah.
**Sglaze**: We gotta just weld the centers of.
**Ataylor**: Those Joists there and there's what, three joists?
**Speaker 3**: Yeah.
**Sglaze**: Correct.
**Ataylor**: So I, I mean, it sounds like that's at least it's probably closer to one night than two, but.
**Sglaze**: Well, let's just plan for two.
**Sglaze**: And then weren't we.
**Sglaze**: We were going to use anything like if they end early, they can hop to the.
**Sglaze**: To the area above the.
**Sglaze**: The platform.
**Sglaze**: The replay platform.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: So maybe I put inbound Tuesday night inbound slash replan platform.
**Sglaze**: That works.
**Speaker 3**: Also said, Drew, we can hop to the area because there's no one underneath it.
**Ataylor**: Yep.
**Speaker 3**: Like without creating a ruckus.
**Speaker 3**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: You know what?
**Ataylor**: We're also.
**Ataylor**: They want to start using that replenishment sorter or we're going to start using it for 30.
**Ataylor**: So I'm wondering if we, instead of starting with inbound, we save inbound for last.
**Ataylor**: I don't.
**Ataylor**: I don't see any issue with that.
**Ataylor**: I'm going to go ahead and make that switch.
**Sglaze**: What switch?
**Shooper**: Germ.
**Ataylor**: Do the inbound plot the replay platform above there before the inbound area.
**Sglaze**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: I want to get outside, you know, away from that replan platform by 4:30, if possible.
**Ataylor**: Again, we want to turn that, turn that conveyor on then.
**Ataylor**: So that one joy or the.
**Ataylor**: The girder that's there.
**Ataylor**: AJ yes.
**Ataylor**: Do we know how many nights we're thinking for that?
**Sglaze**: No.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Sglaze**: I don't know how long that's going to take, Drew.
**Sglaze**: I mean, I think.
**Sglaze**: I think there's at least two weeks of welding in this for this whole thing.
**Sglaze**: So it's just a matter of.
**Sglaze**: I think it's critical to put.
**Sglaze**: Put the dates where ulta.
**Sglaze**: You know, they're using that one aisle.
**Sglaze**: Right.
**Sglaze**: So we need to just confirm what dates those are and then fill in for anything above the platform here.
**Sglaze**: You know, I think the.
**Sglaze**: The portion of over D mod that girder, that's an important portion to let them know what we're doing.
**Sglaze**: Obviously, it's all important, but.
**Ataylor**: Yep.
**Sglaze**: Yeah, I think, I mean, I know that two days for that inbound area.
**Sglaze**: I think a night, you know, for that little square that you see there or that there on the far left right here.
**Sglaze**: Yeah, I think a night for that area.
**Sglaze**: You know, I want to say another night for the area to the right of it.
**Sglaze**: Yep.
**Shooper**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: So we.
**Sglaze**: That.
**Ataylor**: That's limited to weekend work.
**Ataylor**: Right.
**Ataylor**: That's kind of what we need to slot in for Friday, Saturday, Sunday.
**Sglaze**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: And I'm just going to call that decan area that the half of the girder that extends to that.
**Ataylor**: It's really right in between the stairwell.
**Sglaze**: Huh.
**Ataylor**: It goes into the structure, half that stairwell, and then it's the smaller one at the top left and then the.
**Ataylor**: The center one there.
**Ataylor**: We're looking to get that done on weekend.
**Ataylor**: Nice.
**Sglaze**: Yep.
**Ataylor**: And I'm just going to call that whole area decant area because that's where we have got decan operations around.
**Sglaze**: Yep.
**Sglaze**: And then what about that area, the girder above D model?
**Sglaze**: Because that's another trafficked area, right?
**Ataylor**: Yep.
**Sglaze**: So I want to give.
**Sglaze**: I want to give at least a night for that girder.
**Sglaze**: I mean, I don't know how long that's going to take, to be honest, Drew, because it's welding we haven't done before.
**Sglaze**: So I almost want to give two nights for that.
**Shooper**: And I.
**Shooper**: And I think that.
**Shooper**: I think that Michael was saying if it was over top of the.
**Shooper**: Of the.
**Shooper**: Of the mod, then that's something that we could do during the week.
**Ataylor**: Yep.
**Sglaze**: Then everything.
**Sglaze**: Everything else isn't necessarily a trafficked area.
**Sglaze**: Correct.
**Sglaze**: That leaves us with the 1, 2, 3, 4, the five joists that are kind of above the spirals.
**Sglaze**: Just.
**Sglaze**: Just plan south of demod.
**Sglaze**: And then the.
**Sglaze**: The girder work.
**Sglaze**: And we have to weld those at the center of the joists so that those could probably go.
**Sglaze**: End up going pretty quick.
**Ataylor**: Oh, it's just the center of those joists for those five.
**Shooper**: The.
**Speaker 3**: The red bubble indicates the area of the joist that needs reinforcement.
**Speaker 3**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: There's a pretty big.
**Ataylor**: I mean, that's probably about three nights.
**Sglaze**: There, I would say.
**Sglaze**: Three nights.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Sglaze**: I've never worked with Homestead.
**Sglaze**: I don't know how quick they go.
**Sglaze**: So we'll.
**Shooper**: We'll.
**Sglaze**: We'll find out real quick.
**Sglaze**: 21st and 22nd.
**Sglaze**: Really?
**Shooper**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: I'd like to call that.
**Ataylor**: Get a name for that bubble that's coming into.
**Ataylor**: It's in between D mod and the platform.
**Shooper**: I can't see where you're talking about.
**Shooper**: Right.
**Ataylor**: Oh, I mean, that.
**Ataylor**: The fib choice.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, that spot there.
**Sglaze**: So you want to call it replen Joyce.
**Shooper**: Yeah, that's right.
**Shooper**: Now that's where they got all those carts parked at.
**Shooper**: Empty carts.
**Ataylor**: I'm gonna call it repl and slash.
**Ataylor**: D mod.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, There you go.
**Shooper**: Yep.
**Ataylor**: Put three nights for that.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: I'll share my.
**Ataylor**: Steal the screen again for a little bit.
**Ataylor**: So schedule first night discovery next two nights.
**Ataylor**: That girder that's over top of the replenish platform.
**Ataylor**: I mean, it's just the girder there.
**Ataylor**: I don't know what exactly they're doing there, A.J.
**Ataylor**: if it's.
**Sglaze**: It's.
**Sglaze**: It's some angle and I don't have the drawings in front of me right now.
**Sglaze**: One second.
**Sglaze**: Bear with me.
**Ataylor**: Scott.
**Ataylor**: Once we turn that REPLAY Sorter on 4:30, I'm guessing they're going to want to use that during nights, right?
**Ataylor**: Yeah, but, yeah, going to need to.
**Ataylor**: So I'm going to try to.
**Ataylor**: That's why I wanted to move that girder up to the beginning so that we're not over top of it.
**Ataylor**: Come 4:30, I moved inbound back.
**Ataylor**: Drew.
**Sglaze**: I'm.
**Sglaze**: My one drive is logging me out, so it's.
**Sglaze**: We definitely have to bring in some angles on the top angle.
**Sglaze**: I know that, so.
**Sglaze**: And some rod that I.
**Sglaze**: I mean.
**Ataylor**: I think two ninths is probably okay for that, right?
**Sglaze**: Yeah.
**Sglaze**: All right, here we go.
**Sglaze**: Now.
**Sglaze**: I got.
**Sglaze**: Yeah, so.
**Sglaze**: So number four bar on the bottom and the top chord.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Sglaze**: And then that's really it.
**Sglaze**: No, so.
**Shooper**: There'S still a lot of weld.
**Sglaze**: Yeah.
**Sglaze**: Three every three every three every foot.
**Sglaze**: That's what it's calling for.
**Sglaze**: So, Drew, I think I almost want to put three days there.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, that's fine.
**Shooper**: So when you talk third day back.
**Ataylor**: Here.
**Shooper**: When you say three every foot, does that mean three inches every 12 inches?
**Sglaze**: Correct.
**Sglaze**: Yeah.
**Shooper**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: I mean, it's probably four nights of welding between the.
**Ataylor**: The three inbound joists and the replay that girder.
**Ataylor**: If I were to come back and say that makes sense.
**Sglaze**: Yeah.
**Sglaze**: So you're saying if we get done in that inbound area, we can pop back over to that girder.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: And try to finish it.
**Shooper**: That.
**Shooper**: Okay.
**Sglaze**: The only thing you're missing here is.
**Sglaze**: Is the girder above D mod.
**Shooper**: Yeah.
**Shooper**: Foreign.
**Ataylor**: These kind of.
**Ataylor**: These Saturday, Sunday can kind of be a flex of whatever we need to clean up.
**Ataylor**: I think we were hoping to get this whole decan area done in three nights.
**Ataylor**: That may be a little aggressive.
**Sglaze**: Yeah.
**Sglaze**: I mean, this is.
**Sglaze**: This leaves no room for error, so that's why I'm.
**Sglaze**: But I also don't want the guys to be sitting there twiddling their thumbs, so.
**Ataylor**: Well, AJ, this kind of has two days of flex here, right?
**Sglaze**: Yeah, I would.
**Sglaze**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: In three days for that.
**Ataylor**: Who's five joists?
**Ataylor**: I mean, there's a lot of conveyor there, which may slow them down.
**Sglaze**: Definitely going to slow them down.
**Sglaze**: We're.
**Sglaze**: We're probably gonna bring in scaffold and.
**Sglaze**: And, you know, hanging scaffold, pretty much.
**Sglaze**: Oh, well, there's no other.
**Sglaze**: There's no other real option.
**Sglaze**: I don't know how we get a boom in there.
**Sglaze**: So that's why I wanted that discovery night too.
**Sglaze**: I mean, hopefully we're gonna have to come up with a.
**Ataylor**: Which again, if this is probably closer to four nights, then we would just use another night on that replaying D mod gap instead here.
**Ataylor**: I mean, I think that's probably pretty accurate or at least, you know, the best that we can put it.
**Ataylor**: Put a schedule to it for now.
**Sglaze**: Yeah.
**Sglaze**: I mean, are we confident we can get that D mod girder done?
**Sglaze**: And I guess you said we can always pop over somewhere.
**Sglaze**: As I just know walking with Michael, he was.
**Sglaze**: And you know how old it is.
**Sglaze**: They don't want to deviate at all, so.
**Ataylor**: Yep.
**Shooper**: Yeah.
**Shooper**: That's the toughest part of the whole thing.
**Sglaze**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: Can we go back to that drawing, Steve?
**Sglaze**: Like, I would hate for.
**Sglaze**: I would hate for.
**Sglaze**: There's a lot to work around, so.
**Ataylor**: That's a good point.
**Ataylor**: AJ Though, for that area there where they need to cover up demod inventory.
**Ataylor**: If we need to do that two nights, we should have some sort of at least contingency plan cleaning that up another night, Correct?
**Sglaze**: Yes.
**Ataylor**: And we could even throw that in the next week's Monday.
**Sglaze**: I like that.
**Ataylor**: I don't like moving the crew around a bunch, but.
**Sglaze**: Yeah, I don't either.
**Sglaze**: But I mean, I.
**Sglaze**: I was thinking all along in the back of my head, you know, three weeks of welding just.
**Sglaze**: Just in case.
**Sglaze**: But.
**Shooper**: I think most of that's going to be because we have to do so much moving around.
**Sglaze**: Correct.
**Shooper**: Because if.
**Shooper**: If you're.
**Shooper**: If you have.
**Shooper**: I guess what I'm.
**Shooper**: What I'm seeing is, you know, what I hear from.
**Shooper**: From Steve there is that the, The.
**Shooper**: The bubbles indicate where.
**Shooper**: So we're not doing the entire joists on most of this stuff.
**Shooper**: Right.
**Shooper**: It's.
**Shooper**: It's just so, you know, if they were doing an entire joist a night or whatever, and now we're just doing partials, there's going to be less moving around, first of all, just for.
**Shooper**: Just for an area.
**Shooper**: So it may be, you know, it may be.
**Shooper**: So you'd like to say that's a pleasant surprise.
**Shooper**: That's going faster than you thought.
**Shooper**: But then, like you said, you can't.
**Shooper**: There's.
**Shooper**: Alta has no flexibility, so we can't just move on to another area.
**Ataylor**: Yep.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: That's why I just changed it a little bit.
**Ataylor**: And now I'm hesitant to do that and put D mod girder at the end on Monday, Tuesday, because if we're done with welding by Friday, Saturday, the week before, we're going to want to do that demod girder and not have the crew sit there.
**Ataylor**: I don't know how big of an issue that would be.
**Sglaze**: We're gonna know a lot more after that first night of welding.
**Ataylor**: The first discovery night, or first.
**Sglaze**: Yeah, here, one second.
**Sglaze**: Someone's knocking my door.
**Shooper**: I think.
**Shooper**: I think both of those.
**Speaker 3**: Night of actual welding.
**Shooper**: I think.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Shooper**: After the discovery night and after the first night of welding.
**Shooper**: I think we're gonna know a lot after those two nights.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Shooper**: And then maybe we can call like an emergency meeting with Michael and or JP or whoever and just be like, listen, this is what's going on.
**Shooper**: This is what you know.
**Shooper**: Yeah.
**Shooper**: This is why.
**Shooper**: This is why we underestimated or overestimated what we were doing.
**Shooper**: Here's what we want.
**Shooper**: Or here's know, let's throw this out there and see what you say.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: To your point, Scott, we probably want to do that regardless.
**Ataylor**: Just to say, hey, we made about as much progress as we thought we were doing, so we'll stick to the schedule.
**Ataylor**: Or we're going to have to adjust.
**Shooper**: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Ataylor**: If we were to somehow get the whole replaying gerder done in one night, I don't think that would happen, but possible.
**Sglaze**: We just have to factor in.
**Sglaze**: I don't know what the scaffold situation is going to look like.
**Sglaze**: That's.
**Sglaze**: That's why I'm a little leery.
**Shooper**: That could had damn near a whole night.
**Sglaze**: I think it's going to take a whole night just to set up.
**Ataylor**: So where do we need scaffolding?
**Ataylor**: Just above just that d.
**Ataylor**: Mod Replaying gap?
**Shooper**: No, it'll be.
**Shooper**: It would be above the.
**Shooper**: The platform, the replenishment platform, the girder.
**Ataylor**: That's there.
**Sglaze**: Yep.
**Sglaze**: There's a little bit of joist, I think, that.
**Shooper**: Overlaps.
**Shooper**: There's some joist work there too, I believe.
**Sglaze**: Yeah.
**Shooper**: I don't know.
**Shooper**: I can't.
**Shooper**: I can't really see it.
**Shooper**: I'm.
**Shooper**: I'm in my truck on my phone.
**Sglaze**: Yeah, there's a little bit of joist work there.
**Ataylor**: There's joist work there.
**Sglaze**: Yeah.
**Sglaze**: You can see.
**Sglaze**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: Okay, gotcha.
**Shooper**: And as.
**Shooper**: As far as that.
**Shooper**: That main girder, I think regular.
**Shooper**: I think regular scaffolding would work on that because they could set it up with the.
**Shooper**: The legs on wheels in between the.
**Shooper**: The runs of conveyor going to the sawtooth merge and just kind of move along that because it goes in the same direction.
**Shooper**: Now, the problem would be with the.
**Shooper**: The other stuff that's over, like over top of the sorter and things of the joist work that's there because the joists run in opposite.
**Shooper**: Opposite direction, north to south.
**Shooper**: And the sword, the sorter itself is on the edge of the platform.
**Shooper**: So there's no.
**Shooper**: How you want to say, there's no.
**Shooper**: There's no straddling the sorter.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Shooper**: Which would be part of the problem.
**Sglaze**: Is it something.
**Sglaze**: If we extend a big lift, Scott, extend it out, we could reach it.
**Sglaze**: Maybe.
**Shooper**: Well, kind of.
**Shooper**: Sort of.
**Ataylor**: Maybe.
**Shooper**: Maybe not.
**Shooper**: Because you also have to remember there's an empty tote line that runs over top of that sorter that stops you from being able to go in, you know, in over top of the platform.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Shooper**: Basically.
**Shooper**: Where that sorter is on the edge of the platform, there's.
**Shooper**: There's a conveyor line that runs.
**Shooper**: I don't know, Steve, what is it, about 4ft above the sorter?
**Shooper**: Yeah, it's 4 or 5ft above the sorter.
**Shooper**: Something like that.
**Shooper**: There's a.
**Shooper**: There's a line that runs over top of it.
**Shooper**: So then that crunches down your.
**Shooper**: Your area between the top of that to the.
**Shooper**: To the.
**Shooper**: To the joists.
**Shooper**: I mean, I'm not saying it can't be done.
**Shooper**: I've.
**Shooper**: I've.
**Shooper**: I fit a basket of a.
**Shooper**: The.
**Shooper**: The basket of a articulating boom lift into some really stupid places, and I was able to get it out, luckily.
**Shooper**: But I've been lucky a couple times too.
**Ataylor**: All right, let's go back to the schedule for a second.
**Ataylor**: I've got a hop to a 2:00, so.
**Sglaze**: I mean, I.
**Sglaze**: I think we use the.
**Sglaze**: That's kind of why I wanted two nights of discovery to.
**Sglaze**: To.
**Sglaze**: They got to get all their equipment there and then maybe even start setting up scaffold just to see what that looks like.
**Sglaze**: But one night's okay as long as Ulta is okay with it maybe bleeding, you know, into that first week of May more.
**Shooper**: I think.
**Shooper**: I think to.
**Shooper**: To your point, Drew, I think you're right.
**Shooper**: No matter what, we need to make it clear to Michael that we want to have that night of discovery and then go ahead and start welding and we'll find out.
**Shooper**: So do we give it two nights after startup or three nights after startup and then we reconvene and say, hey, this is what we've learned.
**Shooper**: We want to change to this?
**Shooper**: Or like you said, this is what we've learned.
**Shooper**: We've done this and we want to stick with the same Schedule.
**Shooper**: We think we're good with it one way or the other.
**Shooper**: We need to have a little get together with them after two nights or after three nights, whatever that is.
**Shooper**: Just we can confirm or deny that we're going to be good.
**Shooper**: True.
**Speaker 3**: Our commitment is to finish in three weeks.
**Speaker 3**: Right.
**Speaker 3**: Like, we'll do quicker if we can.
**Ataylor**: But we told you don't have a commitment on time.
**Ataylor**: I mean, it's okay.
**Sglaze**: Drew, I.
**Sglaze**: I like that you put discovery, Discovery and.
**Sglaze**: And scaffolding, and then the replan platform girder right after.
**Sglaze**: Because let's say we get through it and our scaffolding goes up quick, then we can just roll on Tuesday, potentially right into the replan girder.
**Sglaze**: Would that be okay?
**Sglaze**: I would just label it as a day of replan girder.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Sglaze**: Two.
**Sglaze**: That Tuesday, the 22nd.
**Ataylor**: Yep.
**Ataylor**: I'm like.
**Sglaze**: I think that looks good.
**Ataylor**: But it probably.
**Ataylor**: I mean, if that happens, we'll have to adjust here.
**Ataylor**: Oh, probably.
**Ataylor**: I mean, it's hard to put this together.
**Sglaze**: We're almost there.
**Sglaze**: Almost done with welding.
**Shooper**: Yeah.
**Shooper**: I don't.
**Shooper**: I don't like the way that they expect this.
**Shooper**: The certain.
**Shooper**: The certain level of detail with this.
**Shooper**: It's not like this is something we do every job.
**Shooper**: You know, typically if we do this on a job, it's before all the shit's in the way.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: Sorry, guys, I gotta jump to this other call.
**Ataylor**: I didn't have a full hour block this afternoon, but.
**Shooper**: Right.
**Ataylor**: AJ and maybe Scott, when you're together later, I'll give you a call.
**Shooper**: Yeah, I think you got what you need, right?
**Sglaze**: I think.
**Sglaze**: Yeah, I think.
**Sglaze**: I think you got what you need, Drew.
**Sglaze**: And will you just share that to me?
**Sglaze**: And I can mark up a drawing as well.
**Sglaze**: And, Steve, have you.
**Sglaze**: Do you mind sending me.
**Ataylor**: Yep.
**Ataylor**: Sorry, guys, I really got jump.
**Shooper**: Yep.
**Sglaze**: Steve, do you mind sending me PDFs of those areas?
**Sglaze**: That way I can put it together and I can mark it up.
**Ataylor**: Sure.
**Sglaze**: That you.
**Sglaze**: That you have outlined in red.
**Shooper**: Yep.
**Sglaze**: And I think.
**Sglaze**: I think we're good.
**Sglaze**: I mean, that I'll be able to share that with Colby, and then we'll be good to go.
**Shooper**: All right.
**Shooper**: You know, just the main thing that they're going to be worried about is, you know, number one, obviously, the schedule.
**Shooper**: But sometimes I've been.
**Shooper**: I'm not promising anything, but sometimes I've been a little convincing and telling them what they want.
**Shooper**: It's an old tactic that I learned from one of our old sales guys.
**Shooper**: But the biggest thing is going to be what they're talking about is the mitigation, the smoke mitigation, the.
**Shooper**: You know what I'm saying?
**Shooper**: If we start doing this and starts getting murky and it's looking terrible in there, and they start making phone calls, and we are going to be.
**Shooper**: Shut the down.
**Shooper**: Okay.
**Sglaze**: Yeah.
**Shooper**: All right.
**Shooper**: So we need to make sure that they got.
**Shooper**: That they know that they need to have their smoke heaters and.
**Shooper**: And all that stuff.
**Shooper**: And I'll be talking to Michael about, you know, he was talking about having.
**Shooper**: You know, because we got to raise up all the dock doors.
**Shooper**: And remember we had snow fence that was going across the dock doors with carabiners and all that stuff.
**Sglaze**: Yeah.
**Shooper**: I have no idea.
**Shooper**: I have no idea where that stuff went.
**Shooper**: So I'm gonna have to talk to him about getting more snow fence.
**Shooper**: I think he's got some in his office, but gonna have to go and find some carabiners to be able to put them on that.
**Sglaze**: Yeah.
**Shooper**: And.
**Sglaze**: And I'm gonna get.
**Sglaze**: That reminds me, I'll have Colby send me, like, submittals on the equipment he's using.
**Shooper**: Okay.
**Sglaze**: I know Michael's going so far as, like.
**Sglaze**: Like, model numbers and serial numbers on.
**Shooper**: Yeah, yeah.
**Shooper**: He was like.
**Shooper**: He was like, yeah, I want to have the same model numbers and all that stuff.
**Shooper**: Like what?
**Shooper**: Dude?
**Shooper**: Dude.
**Sglaze**: You know, it just depends on the rental company.
**Shooper**: Yeah.
**Shooper**: Let me put it this way.
**Shooper**: It's obvious that Michael is not from his background, is not in this realm.
**Shooper**: It's obvious that he came from operations.
**Sglaze**: Oh, yeah.
**Shooper**: That's where he.
**Shooper**: That's how he got to where he's at right now as he worked his way up there in ops and finds himself now in this position.
**Shooper**: And you can tell his background is not in construction.
**Shooper**: But anyway, I digress.
**Shooper**: What else we got, guys?
**Shooper**: We got anything else we can go on in here?
**Sglaze**: I think we're good.
**Speaker 3**: I'm good.
**Speaker 3**: Scott, can you hang out for just a second?
**Speaker 3**: I just want to make sure you got everything for me in the days coming up.
**Shooper**: No, that's right, because you're.
**Shooper**: Take it off.
**Speaker 3**: No, I'm not taking off, but I know you got the gate cut in this weekend, and.
**Shooper**: Oh, no, that's right.
**Shooper**: That's drew.
**Shooper**: That's taking Thursday and Friday off Vegas.
**Shooper**: Yeah.
**Shooper**: Crazy.
**Shooper**: So did you see.
**Shooper**: You see my email earlier?
**Speaker 3**: I saw that.
**Speaker 3**: The eight power supplies.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Shooper**: Okay, so I don't have.
**Shooper**: Obviously we have enough to do what we need to do this weekend, because we really only need the bottom gate on B2 and three in the bottom gate on right.
**Shooper**: D2 and three.
**Shooper**: So we have enough to do this weekend.
**Shooper**: But we really got to find out what happened to the.
**Shooper**: To the power supplies that were supposed to be with the gates that came from Greenwood.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: At this point, I'm not optimistic that they'll ever.
**Shooper**: Oh, no, no.
**Speaker 3**: Just gonna have to reorder them and.
**Shooper**: Who knows how long that takes.
**Shooper**: Plus, you know, we have that one that's had a whole bunch of pieces.
**Shooper**: Parts stolen from it.
**Shooper**: Something else I remembered.
**Shooper**: You know, we got those.
**Shooper**: The white spacers that get bolted in on the handles.
**Shooper**: I have the white spacers, but I'm gonna have to go and buy some.
**Shooper**: It's just.
**Shooper**: I think it's four quarter inch.
**Shooper**: Four quarter inch bolts that are like three or four inches long.
**Shooper**: Along with some nuts.
**Shooper**: I'm gonna have to go buy some of those.
**Shooper**: Do you know what I'm talking about?
**Speaker 3**: Yes.
**Shooper**: Okay, so I do.
**Shooper**: I did see a box of those spacers.
**Shooper**: I don't think I'm just looking at it.
**Shooper**: I don't think I have enough of them.
**Shooper**: But I've got enough.
**Shooper**: I.
**Shooper**: I think maybe I'm only missing enough for two.
**Shooper**: One or two more gates.
**Shooper**: But I will confirm that before I tell you anything definitively.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Speaker 3**: The highway guardrail Michael's supposed to be.
**Speaker 3**: And all the guarding stuff, he's supposed to be nailing that down this week.
**Speaker 3**: I did get this stuff re quoted and it's a three to four week lead time.
**Shooper**: Okay.
**Shooper**: Yeah.
**Shooper**: All the stuff that I have here on site, I had here on site.
**Shooper**: I shipped it back to Roanoke.
**Shooper**: I just don't have the room to keep it here.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah.
**Shooper**: I got that damn spiral that goes down at the end for the.
**Shooper**: Where the stuff comes out of the OPEX and goes up to the replenishment sorter.
**Shooper**: Yep.
**Shooper**: I got that spiral here.
**Shooper**: And I.
**Shooper**: I can't put it in, so I can't stand it up, which means it takes up a ton of room.
**Shooper**: I feel like that.
**Shooper**: I think that was ordered to be here now in case we wanted to use that as a way to get empty totes up there.
**Shooper**: I think that's why that was ordered for now.
**Shooper**: Yep.
**Shooper**: Because we really don't need that.
**Shooper**: Technically, we wouldn't need that until OPEX is done.
**Shooper**: And I've got the conveyor built down at the other end.
**Shooper**: But hey, whatever.
**Speaker 3**: I take said, your steel's supposed to be there tomorrow.
**Shooper**: Yeah, I'll believe that when I see it.
**Speaker 3**: It went from the end of last week to no later than Monday to now, Wednesday.
**Shooper**: Yeah, I think somebody told.
**Shooper**: What's his name, Nacho.
**Shooper**: I think somebody told him earlier on the phone that it was either going to go out today or tomorrow.
**Shooper**: So.
**Speaker 3**: Breton just said it.
**Speaker 3**: He.
**Speaker 3**: They loaded the truck up today so it should be on site by end of day tomorrow is what the latest.
**Shooper**: Update from them is.
**Shooper**: But yeah, we'll see.
**Speaker 3**: You got your hardware, I'm assuming?
**Speaker 3**: Because I got an invoice.
**Shooper**: Yes, there was a skid.
**Shooper**: There was a skid and they tried delivering it to Domatic, but they called me.
**Shooper**: It was while I was at home.
**Shooper**: There's a skid of hardware and then six bundles of all thread.
**Speaker 3**: Okay, you get your netting yet?
**Shooper**: I haven't seen it.
**Speaker 3**: All right, follow up on that again.
**Speaker 3**: I asked for your oiler detail.
**Speaker 3**: I'll follow up on that again.
**Shooper**: I saw that email.
**Shooper**: I didn't see anything back from them, nor did I.
**Shooper**: So there is something.
**Shooper**: I guess there is something else maybe I want.
**Shooper**: Maybe you can check on.
**Shooper**: So they went ahead, they, they changed.
**Shooper**: They took the two beds out up there and put the two new beds.
**Speaker 3**: In on the sorter.
**Shooper**: Yeah, they did that last Friday.
**Shooper**: I think it's actually three beds right now.
**Shooper**: It's two.
**Speaker 3**: Supposed to have like a.
**Speaker 3**: There's the bed section with the switch in it.
**Speaker 3**: And then there was supposed to be a short intermediate on.
**Speaker 3**: Well, one was short, one was longer on either side.
**Shooper**: Really?
**Shooper**: I don't, I don't think so.
**Shooper**: I thought it was just two beds.
**Speaker 3**: Trying to find the detail.
**Shooper**: I'll go up there and make sure.
**Shooper**: But I thought it was just two beds.
**Shooper**: There was two intermediate beds that were the same size and we took those out and put the one with the switch in, but it was longer than those two.
**Shooper**: And then there was a shorter bed.
**Speaker 3**: What got ordered was one 7 foot 6 intermediate, one 5 foot 10 divert section and one 1 foot 8 inch intermediate, replacing a, a 9 foot intermediate and a 6 foot intermediate.
**Shooper**: Huh.
**Shooper**: I will have to go and look at that.
**Shooper**: Maybe the two, maybe the, the.
**Shooper**: The bed with the switch and the 1 foot 8 intermediate bed were bolted together already.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, yeah, sounds plausible.
**Shooper**: Maybe that's what it was.
**Shooper**: But you're right, it was just.
**Shooper**: What am I supposed, what are we supposed to do with the two beds that came out?
**Speaker 3**: Well, if I know.
**Shooper**: Okay, that's not my question though.
**Shooper**: My question is I know when those two, those two beds that came out, I know there was at least one of those flappers that are in there for the like the lost shoes or Whatever I need to know.
**Shooper**: We're supposed to put one back in because there was not one that was already mounted in the new beds.
**Shooper**: Okay.
**Shooper**: So I need to know if we need to put.
**Shooper**: Take that off of the old bed before we get rid of it and put it into the new bed and where it needs to go.
**Shooper**: Because what's.
**Shooper**: Because what's his name is also.
**Shooper**: There needs to be.
**Shooper**: And if it does, there needs to be.
**Shooper**: Cody was trying to find the electrical schematic for adding that, because if one of those flappers goes back in, he's got to put an eye on it.
**Shooper**: Yep.
**Shooper**: So we need to know what has to happen.
**Shooper**: Okay.
**Speaker 3**: I will find out.
**Shooper**: All right.
**Shooper**: Thank you, sir.
**Speaker 3**: Working on a.
**Speaker 3**: Getting DMS drawings plotted out so I can send them your way.
**Shooper**: That's over there.
**Shooper**: The shuttle.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah.
**Shooper**: Okay.
**Shooper**: Yeah, they.
**Shooper**: If they're gonna.
**Shooper**: If they're gonna take that fan off, you know, take that down, they need to do that real soon.
**Shooper**: Yep.
**Shooper**: So.
**Shooper**: All righty, ma'am.
**Speaker 3**: That's all I got.
**Shooper**: I'll be talking to you.
**Ataylor**: All right.
**Speaker 3**: See you, Scott.
