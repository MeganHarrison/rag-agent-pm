**Jdawson**: We're going to start on some of the stucco repairs.
**Jdawson**: We'll jump back to the interior.
**Jdawson**: As far as interior goes, we have to finish completing the ceiling grid, drop the ceiling tiles and then we're pretty much complete on the interior except for just some small little details in there.
**Rmohammed**: So the interior, the only thing that is left is the ceiling tiles, correct?
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: Ceiling grid and ceiling tiles is all that's left.
**Crusin**: So windows in ceiling, you got to seal the top of that deck to the wall.
**Crusin**: We're going to do that too.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: The CMU block that's on top of the bond beam, we just have to make sure that's sealed real airtight.
**Jdawson**: So that's one other thing you do have to do on the inter exterior.
**Jdawson**: Like I said, we're going to start the stucco repairs today.
**Jdawson**: Then we got some aluminum trim that we got to install, apply the sealants at the doors and windows and then we'll finish up with some paint around 4, 3 and then we have a final clean scheduled for 4, 7 and then we should be wrapped up.
**Jdawson**: 4, 3.
**Rmohammed**: We.
**Rmohammed**: You're saying that you're going to be completed, right?

**Jdawson**: Then we have a final clean scheduled for four Seven candle.
**Crusin**: When was that tile arriving?
**Crusin**: Sorry, Ronnie.
**Jdawson**: That is.
**Jdawson**: Let me double check that so that's readily available at Home Depot.
**Crusin**: Okay, good.
**Jdawson**: So we can go ahead and pick that up at any time.
**Jdawson**: So we'll go ahead and grab that probably first thing next week.
**Jdawson**: So we have that on site, ready to go.
**Crusin**: Sorry, Ronnie, what were you gonna say?
**Rmohammed**: No, no, no.
**Rmohammed**: I.
**Rmohammed**: I put four, four for the completion, you know.
**Rmohammed**: I know you said four three.
**Rmohammed**: Four four is fine.
**Rmohammed**: Four, seven, final cleanup.
**Rmohammed**: I'm good with that.
**Rmohammed**: Time frame now.
**Rmohammed**: All inspections is completed.
**Jdawson**: We'll have to go for the CO building with the building department.
**Jdawson**: We'll schedule that for four, seven.
**Crusin**: Is Brian.
**Crusin**: Was he going to come look at anything?
**Crusin**: Are you taking pictures of the final brackets they're putting in?
**Jdawson**: I'll take pictures of the final brackets, and then I'll send him an email with those.
**Jdawson**: And then basically reiterating then that now we'll be removing the main storing in the dining room.
**Rmohammed**: And I got to get our email OPC today because we never got any official email from them approving the project or.
**Rmohammed**: The only thing that was given was a phone call to Brian.
**Rmohammed**: So I need to see if they're going to be coming out to do inspection prior to re entry into that space.
**Crusin**: Okay.
**Crusin**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: That pretty much does it for the schedule.
**Speaker 3**: Okay.
**Crusin**: Where's your agenda?
**Speaker 3**: Okay, and then life safety plans.
**Speaker 3**: We're in contact with the architect, and we're.
**Speaker 3**: We're working on those.
**Rmohammed**: Well, this is.
**Rmohammed**: This is for Rich Haven, right?
**Crusin**: Yeah.
**Crusin**: We got in touch with that guy that you sent us, the plan that had done it before.
**Crusin**: He said he'd sure like to do it, so we're going to send him, since we already got CAD files done, you know, that we did for your facility here.
**Crusin**: We'll send those to them, and we'll see how soon he can get there to knock it out.
**Rmohammed**: That's.
**Rmohammed**: That's Amelia from A1, correct?
**Crusin**: A1.
**Crusin**: Yes.
**Crusin**: Yep.
**Rmohammed**: Yeah.
**Rmohammed**: Okay.
**Rmohammed**: That's fine.
**Rmohammed**: But that's the ls join.
**Crusin**: The punch list.
**Crusin**: Can we be doing that as soon as everyone gets finished?
**Crusin**: And then do you want us to walk through with you on the punch list, or do you want to have.
**Rmohammed**: Your guy here and the facility guy could walk through?
**Rmohammed**: Unless you guys need me on site.
**Rmohammed**: I mean, I was there, like, two weeks ago.
**Rmohammed**: Everything looked fine.
**Rmohammed**: I was there with Annalise, so.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Crusin**: Okay.
**Rmohammed**: I'm pretty good.
**Crusin**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: I'll get with Josh on that.
**Rmohammed**: Yeah, I saw pictures from.
**Rmohammed**: From Mark on roof options with the completion, so I'm pretty good.
**Crusin**: Okay.
**Crusin**: And then just wanted to walk through the contingency with you.
**Crusin**: The ceiling tile, once we went back and put them all and fixing some of the grid there, it came in around 7,000 to provide the tile and install them everywhere because they got to go in and take all the lights out.
**Crusin**: The H VAC grills.
**Crusin**: And so it's a little bit of work to get those replaced.
**Crusin**: Reinforcement of the masonry cells that was at RFI we had that was 750.
**Crusin**: Additional shoring rental.
**Crusin**: They ended up having two more months of that.
**Crusin**: That was 2500.
**Crusin**: The fire wrap we got from Medicare was 1970.
**Crusin**: So that all totals like 12, 220.
**Crusin**: And we had a fifteen thousand dollar contingency.
**Crusin**: So there's still like 2780 left that.
**Crusin**: I mean we can apply it to the life safety plan if you'd like.
**Crusin**: I don't know how much that guy will charge us.
**Rmohammed**: Yeah, that's fine.
**Crusin**: Okay.
**Crusin**: And then one.
**Rmohammed**: Well, hold on because I don't want to share unless.
**Rmohammed**: So the way we got to work this is we would have to incorporate getting life safety drawings for OPC submission.
**Rmohammed**: Right.
**Rmohammed**: So it cannot be a separate breakout if we're going to incorporate it in this project.
**Rmohammed**: It has to be acquired life safety drawings per OPC recommendation or submission.
**Rmohammed**: Submittal packet.
**Crusin**: Okay.
**Rmohammed**: Due to the facility not having plans.
**Rmohammed**: Something along those lines.
**Crusin**: Oh, you're saying just a word at that way.
**Rmohammed**: Yes.
**Crusin**: On the change order.
**Crusin**: Okay.
**Rmohammed**: Correct.
**Crusin**: That's a good point.
**Rmohammed**: Yeah.
**Rmohammed**: Because it's a.
**Rmohammed**: Because it's an insurance claim.
**Rmohammed**: Yeah.
**Rmohammed**: I just gotta be careful how we would that so.
**Crusin**: Okay.
**Crusin**: Nick, do you understand that?
**Speaker 3**: Not fully.
**Speaker 3**: Can you go over one more time how you want that worded?
**Speaker 3**: Ronnie?
**Rmohammed**: So basically I wanted worded in a way that we are saying that because of OPC ACA requirement to have life safety drawings for the submittal packet we had to acquire life safety drawings by licensed architect, engineer, whatever.
**Rmohammed**: Something along those lines.
**Speaker 3**: Okay.
**Crusin**: For the ceiling tile one should we just put on their ceiling tile damage throughout from water due to the roof leaks.
**Crusin**: So when you word that one, Nick.
**Rmohammed**: Yeah.
**Rmohammed**: Due to water intrusion from roof damage.
**Crusin**: And then the same thing with the fire wrap due to damage from like when it literally did knocked off the fireproof and it was on the ductwork.
**Crusin**: Make sure you write that in there, Nick.
**Rmohammed**: And that's part off the.
**Rmohammed**: The inspection requirements.
**Rmohammed**: So.
**Crusin**: Yep.
**Crusin**: Yep.
**Crusin**: And then just a question because there's.
**Crusin**: There's these black lights that mount up on the soffit and I guess canon Said they're like, throughout the building.
**Crusin**: We were just.
**Crusin**: We were going to put that up and then the other lights that were on the back.
**Crusin**: Is that what you want us to do is just redo the existing lights or change them out.
**Jdawson**: Ronnie?
**Jdawson**: Both.
**Rmohammed**: Both.
**Jdawson**: All three of those lights that were on that soffit are in really rough condition.
**Jdawson**: The electrician.
**Rmohammed**: Is it a regular floodlights?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So there's the floodlights, and then there's.
**Jdawson**: At every doorway, you have a little square light right above the doors.
**Rmohammed**: Yeah.
**Rmohammed**: So if it's an exit door, you're required by code to have those lights.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Crusin**: So.
**Jdawson**: The electricians were saying they can get them up and installed, but they're in rough shape.
**Jdawson**: They're corroded.
**Jdawson**: A lot of the mounting brackets are pretty much shot on them, so they would have to kind of rig them up to be able to secure them to their boxes.
**Rmohammed**: So replace it.
**Rmohammed**: If it's.
**Rmohammed**: If it's damage, you know, damage because of hurricane.
**Rmohammed**: Because of the hurricane damages, we're gonna replace it.
**Crusin**: Okay.
**Crusin**: Okay.
**Rmohammed**: Once it's in that section.
**Crusin**: What about the exit lights?
**Crusin**: Canon?
**Crusin**: Were they okay?
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: Those are okay for the interior.
**Jdawson**: Those are in good shape.
**Crusin**: Okay.
**Speaker 3**: Okay.
**Speaker 3**: And I'll.
**Speaker 3**: I'll put those together today, Ronnie, and email them to you.
**Speaker 3**: The contingency changes.
**Speaker 3**: And the last thing we had was the pay app, I.
**Speaker 3**: I believe the January app.
**Speaker 3**: I don't know if we.
**Speaker 3**: We got paid for that yet, so I was wondering if you could check on that.
**Rmohammed**: Okay.
**Rmohammed**: So that was the fifth.
**Rmohammed**: 60%.
**Rmohammed**: Right.
**Rmohammed**: Let me make a note of that.
**Rmohammed**: I know I asked that two weeks ago, so I'll follow up and see where we at with it.
**Speaker 3**: Okay, thank you.
**Crusin**: And Ronnie, actually, I think the January one was just the first one for the design costs and mobilization.
**Crusin**: I think there's two of them out there.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, there's two of them.
**Crusin**: The first one wasn't that much.
**Crusin**: The second one just took it up to 60%.
**Rmohammed**: Okay.
**Speaker 3**: Is there anything else anyone wanted to talk about?
**Jdawson**: I know I'm pretty good here as far as Ridge Haven goes.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Rmohammed**: I'm pretty good.
**Crusin**: I'm.
**Rmohammed**: I'm satisfied.
**Rmohammed**: I don't have any issues.
**Crusin**: Okay.
**Crusin**: And I guess one last thing, like the outside there, you know, that the ground got.
**Crusin**: We got all the sidewalks replaced, but the ground's tore up and just dirt.
**Crusin**: Is.
**Crusin**: Is the insurance company going to.
**Crusin**: Would they pay you to sod the areas that got, you know, they're just dirt now, or are you taking care of that yourself later?
**Rmohammed**: I'll Take care.
**Rmohammed**: I'll.
**Rmohammed**: I'll take care of that internally.
**Rmohammed**: I don't think they're going to cover that because we were responsible for removing the tree.
**Crusin**: Okay.
**Rmohammed**: Yeah.
**Rmohammed**: So I don't think they're going to cover that.
**Rmohammed**: Okay.
**Rmohammed**: And I'll follow up.
**Rmohammed**: I'll tell up on this payment after this call.
**Rmohammed**: Okay.
**Rmohammed**: Other than this, St.
**Rmohammed**: Lucy, I know the state left yesterday.
**Rmohammed**: So are we still on plan for Monday?
**Crusin**: Yeah.
**Crusin**: Canon will be there Monday morning, right Canon?
**Jdawson**: Yes, sir.
**Jdawson**: Yep, we'll be there Monday morning.
**Jdawson**: I got both the welder and our other subcontractor lined up to be there as well.
**Jdawson**: So that's good.
**Crusin**: You get all the insurance info you needed, Ronnie, for them guys?
**Rmohammed**: Yes, I do.
**Rmohammed**: Eyes I.
**Speaker 3**: Is there.
**Speaker 3**: I don't think I got information as to who you want additionally insured.
**Speaker 3**: So I do have COIs for the subcontractors that I can send you.
**Speaker 3**: They.
**Speaker 3**: They didn't list anything as additionally insured though.
**Rmohammed**: Once we have it for the folks, especially welding on that roof, are they pre fobbing that that frame on the ground before putting it up on the roof or are they doing the welding on the roof?
**Jdawson**: The plan would be to do some.
**Crusin**: Welding on the roof, but they're going to use fire blankets.
**Crusin**: They'll have fire extinguishers.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Rmohammed**: And then you're going to be on site for this, right?
**Jdawson**: Absolutely.
**Jdawson**: From start to finish, anytime any welding is going on, I'll be up on the roof with them being fire watch.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Rmohammed**: Yeah.
**Rmohammed**: So send me this.
**Rmohammed**: I don't.
**Rmohammed**: I'm not.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, I'll send those to you.
**Rmohammed**: Yeah, please.
**Rmohammed**: I have it on file.
**Speaker 3**: Okay.
**Rmohammed**: I don't see it.
**Rmohammed**: Yeah.
**Rmohammed**: How long do we think St Lucie project is going to be?
**Jdawson**: 5 days.
**Jdawson**: I'm planning on.
**Jdawson**: I'm shooting to have it done in three, but we got five planned.
**Rmohammed**: All right, that's.
**Rmohammed**: And who's doing the H Vac setback in place.
**Rmohammed**: That.
**Jdawson**: That's going to be our subcontractor.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Image.
**Rmohammed**: Okay.
**Rmohammed**: All right.
**Rmohammed**: The sounds like a plan.
**Rmohammed**: So I will let the facility know to expect you Monday morning.
**Jdawson**: Okay, perfect.
**Jdawson**: And I'll reach out to Cornelius as well on my way there Monday as well.
**Rmohammed**: Okay.
**Rmohammed**: Yeah.
**Rmohammed**: I don't foresee having a precon for this.
**Rmohammed**: It's too much of a small job.
**Rmohammed**: Just, you know, just the oversight because of the welding.
**Rmohammed**: And then I did meet with the H Vac contractor on cutting the ductwork instead of doing the truss.
**Rmohammed**: So they.
**Rmohammed**: They were in total agreement.
**Rmohammed**: I'm like it shouldn't take five people to figure this out, but here we are.
**Rmohammed**: So.
**Rmohammed**: Yeah.
**Rmohammed**: So they are gonna get it done.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 3**: Were you saying something about they wanted us to cool the kitchen?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I know we had spoken briefly about you guys having two AC units that you'd have kind of set up in the kitchen area during the summer regardless.
**Rmohammed**: Well, yeah, so part of it was, I think those units weren't maintained properly.
**Rmohammed**: When I visited with Jose from Medicare, we saw some issues with the units which got resolved.
**Rmohammed**: Jesse, I know you had sent me pictures of insulation, but above.
**Rmohammed**: So you got a drop ceiling, and above that, you got smoke barrier with drywall.
**Rmohammed**: Above that drywall there is insulation.
**Rmohammed**: So it was hard to see.
**Rmohammed**: But I haven't heard any complaints since we did the preventive maintenance on the equipment.
**Rmohammed**: Now, we're still cool outside a bit, so I gotta wait till the summertime.
**Rmohammed**: We have had the portables disconnected.
**Rmohammed**: Now I only have one portable on site.
**Rmohammed**: We would probably need a second unit when we discuss the.
**Rmohammed**: When we take those AC units apart.
**Crusin**: Well, the.
**Crusin**: The plan is to.
**Crusin**: We're going to suspend those units, you know, connecting it.
**Crusin**: Right.
**Crusin**: So they should stay continuing operation.
**Crusin**: So that should be how it works.
**Crusin**: So it'd be only if we had any issue with that, but it shouldn't be.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: And, Ronnie, you.
**Jdawson**: You said you had one unit on site, correct?
**Rmohammed**: I still have one on site.
**Rmohammed**: Okay.
**Rmohammed**: I purposely kept it there because of this project.
**Crusin**: So.
**Rmohammed**: Once.
**Rmohammed**: We appreciate it.
**Jdawson**: Thank you, guys.
**Rmohammed**: Anything, just give us a call.
**Jdawson**: We'll do.
**Jdawson**: I'll let Joel know you guys kicked ass again, and we're all done.
**Rmohammed**: Appreciate it.
**Jdawson**: Appreciate it, guys.
**Jdawson**: Thank you.
**Rmohammed**: Yeah, I'll have to wait until summertime to see what's going on with the cooling in that kitchen before it's evaluated again.
**Crusin**: Okay.
**Crusin**: Well, where are you sending us to next?
**Crusin**: Ronnie, we're ready.
**Rmohammed**: Let me see what I have going on.
**Rmohammed**: I'll let you know.
**Crusin**: All right.
**Crusin**: Awesome.
**Rmohammed**: Awesome.
**Rmohammed**: There's always something there.
**Rmohammed**: There's always something to do.
**Rmohammed**: So.
**Crusin**: Yeah, that's right.
**Rmohammed**: I'll definitely get with you.
**Crusin**: Okay, Sounds good.
**Rmohammed**: Appreciate the time.
**Crusin**: All right.
**Rmohammed**: Thank you, guys.
**Crusin**: Thank you, sir.
