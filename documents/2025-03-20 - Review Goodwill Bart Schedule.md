**Speaker 2**: Did the electricians bring some more more people today?
**Ahuettl**: There's three of them.
**Speaker 2**: Is that enough?
**Ahuettl**: My honest opinion, no, that's what we got though.
**Ahuettl**: And yeah, because they.
**Speaker 2**: They said they were going to send some more guys to meet the overhead rough inspection for Tuesday.
**Speaker 2**: That's what Brandon told me.
**Ahuettl**: I see it happening Wednesday.
**Ahuettl**: As of now.
**Ahuettl**: I'm being honest.
**Ahuettl**: The.
**Speaker 2**: If you change that to Wednesday, will it push out our final date?
**Ahuettl**: Well, let's see.
**Ahuettl**: Because I.
**Ahuettl**: I mean got to remember that our real final date is the 18th.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Ahuettl**: So we have three days in here.
**Ahuettl**: Let's not freak out about it.
**Ahuettl**: That's.
**Ahuettl**: That's my big thing.
**Ahuettl**: I don't want to.
**Ahuettl**: I mean we.
**Ahuettl**: We're already jamming it in.
**Ahuettl**: We have a realistic schedule here.
**Ahuettl**: I don't want to make it unrealistic and be at the end, so.
**Ahuettl**: All right.
**Ahuettl**: That doesn't have any ties to it.
**Ahuettl**: Daycare, exterior door.
**Ahuettl**: Andrew, you confirmed with diamond, right?
**Acannon**: Yeah, I talked to them today.
**Acannon**: They're not going to be able to.

**Ahuettl**: We got all the receptacles and switches and in.
**Ahuettl**: I'm going to put this at 70.
**Ahuettl**: 70%.
**Ahuettl**: The remaining is basically firewall.
**Acannon**: If they can't do it on the.
**Ahuettl**: 26Th, well, it's just one thing at a time.
**Acannon**: I know.
**Acannon**: That's why I'm trying to slow you down.
**Ahuettl**: Why was that on there anyway?
**Ahuettl**: What?
**Ahuettl**: I didn't even do that.
**Ahuettl**: And it was already at 4.
**Ahuettl**: 1.
**Ahuettl**: But let's put it to where it's going to be.

**Ahuettl**: Wednesday 26th.
**Ahuettl**: It literally did nothing.
**Ahuettl**: Okay.
**Acannon**: How long does the sidewalk need to.
**Ahuettl**: It's going to take them three hours to do that.
**Acannon**: Okay, but they can install, like say they do it Monday and then diamonds there in the day the next day.
**Acannon**: Like that's plenty of time, right?
**Acannon**: That's not gonna.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah, concrete will.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah, it'll be dry.
**Ahuettl**: Okay.
**Ahuettl**: All right.

**Ahuettl**: Where am I seeing this?
**Ahuettl**: Ace work a short casework.
**Ahuettl**: The.
**Ahuettl**: Is it.
**Speaker 2**: I know we had it in there at one point.
**Ahuettl**: I know.
**Ahuettl**: What's happened to me in the past is like the numbers get messed up and like one is hidden somehow.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Ahuettl**: 42, 43, 44, 45, 6, 7, 8, 9.
**Ahuettl**: Huh.
**Ahuettl**: I mean, I know I had it coming right before.
**Ahuettl**: Oh, it's your task.
**Ahuettl**: Case work.
**Ahuettl**: Install.
**Ahuettl**: What the hell?
**Ahuettl**: That's so weird.
**Ahuettl**: All right.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah.
**Ahuettl**: And I had him down for four days.
**Ahuettl**: What the.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah, seriously.
**Acannon**: Which they'll probably.
**Acannon**: They'll probably have two different.
**Acannon**: I don't know if you want to split it up twice since I'll be here twice on site two different times.
**Ahuettl**: Daycare, casework, install.
**Ahuettl**: All right.
**Ahuettl**: I mean, they better do that in one day.
**Ahuettl**: Like, literally, I can do it one day, so they better be able to do it today.
**Ahuettl**: MDC group, this is Kenny.
**Ahuettl**: Whoa, whoa.
**Acannon**: What day was the daycare install?
**Acannon**: 324.
**Ahuettl**: Daycare casework.
**Ahuettl**: 324.
**Ahuettl**: MDC Group.
**Ahuettl**: When will they have the other stuff?
**Ahuettl**: April.
**Ahuettl**: The next week following.
**Acannon**: Yeah, First.
**Acannon**: First week of April.
**Ahuettl**: Okay.
**Acannon**: We're going to fabricate the rest next week and then a casework.
**Ahuettl**: Let's say three days.
**Ahuettl**: Boom.
**Ahuettl**: That starts 31st through 42.
**Ahuettl**: This is going to be D.C.
**Ahuettl**: group plumbing fixture install.
**Ahuettl**: Move that down to here.
**Ahuettl**: Plumbing fixture install.
**Ahuettl**: I need to make.
**Ahuettl**: Boom.
**Ahuettl**: All right.
**Ahuettl**: Didn't do anything.
**Ahuettl**: Just gonna be busy.
**Ahuettl**: Literally just makes everything busy.
**Acannon**: So moving that inspection date to Wednesday doesn't change anything?
**Ahuettl**: Nope.
**Ahuettl**: Nor does the case work.
**Ahuettl**: Not critical path, which is great.
**Acannon**: You should probably talk to those team guys and make sure they can at least get it done by then.
**Acannon**: Because when I talked to them, they were.
**Acannon**: I mean, they, like, you know, Alex, they were kind of.
**Ahuettl**: They're busting.
**Ahuettl**: They're busting ass.
**Ahuettl**: They're.
**Ahuettl**: I mean, they're not.
**Ahuettl**: I don't.
**Acannon**: It's more.
**Acannon**: They just had no confidence in getting it done on Tuesday.
**Acannon**: So I would hope.
**Acannon**: I don't know if that extra day gets them across the finish line.
**Ahuettl**: It does.
**Ahuettl**: I mean, it definitely gets the lighting over the finish line.
**Ahuettl**: And then what the thing is here.
**Ahuettl**: Where's that electrical, Mechanical, plumbing, fire.
**Ahuettl**: So, like, fire alarm not in here.
**Ahuettl**: Like, that's.
**Ahuettl**: That's another thing.
**Ahuettl**: Like, I think tomorrow I go ask them, does fire alarm need to be completed?
**Acannon**: Okay.
**Ahuettl**: For.
**Speaker 2**: That's the only thing holding us up, Right?
**Ahuettl**: That's the only thing that's going to be holding us up.
**Ahuettl**: Because, I mean, all our sprinkler is roughed in.
**Ahuettl**: All our plumbing is done.
**Ahuettl**: All our mechanical is going to be done.
**Ahuettl**: Electrical is.
**Ahuettl**: I mean, it's all going to be done.
**Ahuettl**: Like, it doesn't sit.
**Ahuettl**: I mean, it says fire suppression.
**Ahuettl**: That's not fire alarm.
**Ahuettl**: So.
**Speaker 2**: Okay, so we should be fine then.
**Ahuettl**: I mean.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah, like that.
**Ahuettl**: That's what I'm.
**Ahuettl**: That's how I interpret this.
**Ahuettl**: But, I mean, I'm gonna.
**Acannon**: I do, too.
**Ahuettl**: But I'm going to verify.
**Ahuettl**: Like, I don't wanna.
**Ahuettl**: I don't wanna.
**Ahuettl**: I don't wanna piss them off.
**Ahuettl**: I don't wanna.
**Ahuettl**: At all.
**Ahuettl**: Like, I want to verify it.
**Speaker 2**: Yes.
**Ahuettl**: Don't want to waste their time.
**Ahuettl**: I don't want to waste taxpayer money, and I don't want to Piss off the.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah.
**Ahuettl**: See if inspections are requested before sign off sheets are submitted, blah, blah, blah.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah, like a.
**Ahuettl**: I don't want a re inspection fee.
**Ahuettl**: I don't want anything.
**Ahuettl**: I just want it to go smooth.
**Ahuettl**: So.
**Speaker 2**: All right.
**Speaker 2**: Well, it looks like the cabinets aren't going to affect the schedule, so we.
**Speaker 2**: We should be.
**Ahuettl**: Okay.
**Ahuettl**: Cabinets aren't going to inspect the schedule and one day lag on the inspection is not going to affect it either.
**Acannon**: But here's the ceiling tile in right with the adjusted delivery date.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah, you're right.
**Ahuettl**: That comes on Tuesday.
**Ahuettl**: We can start installing borders on Wednesday.
**Ahuettl**: Yep, it's already there.
**Acannon**: That gives them what, four or five days then before flooring starts.
**Ahuettl**: Morning starts 3:31 Monday.
**Ahuettl**: 3:31 through 4:11.
**Ahuettl**: It's 10 days materials already on site.
**Ahuettl**: You seeing anything that we need to add any tasks.
**Acannon**: And we agreed that moving.
**Acannon**: If we have to do the daycare door install the following day, that's fine.
**Acannon**: Can't come back.
**Acannon**: If they can't come back on the 26th, what's the latest I should tell them or should I just stick it out and stay late on Wednesday?
**Acannon**: Like if I have to.
**Ahuettl**: I mean, let's see what I mean.
**Ahuettl**: I don't.
**Ahuettl**: That's literally its own task.
**Ahuettl**: Like that's not going to affect anything.
**Ahuettl**: You know what we do need to put in here though?
**Ahuettl**: Where is that daycare exterior door?
**Ahuettl**: Let's put after that's done.
**Ahuettl**: All right.
**Ahuettl**: Daycare, concrete walkway.
**Ahuettl**: Let's say it's going to be tomorrow, two days.
**Ahuettl**: All right.
**Ahuettl**: 3:26.
**Ahuettl**: Let's say it does take two days.
**Ahuettl**: Monday.
**Ahuettl**: It doesn't do anything.
**Ahuettl**: It's its own task.
**Speaker 2**: So you shouldn't have to stay late that day.
**Speaker 2**: Andrew.
**Ahuettl**: No, just have them do it Thursday morning if it's that big of an issue for them to get down there during the day.
**Speaker 2**: Did you guys have anything else to add?
**Acannon**: I was calling David with diamond glass.
**Acannon**: He didn't answer, but I'll tell him.
**Acannon**: Yeah, they can.
**Acannon**: They can install on the 26th or 27th.
**Speaker 2**: We'Ve got on this.
**Ahuettl**: So I think so let's just double check that it uploaded to pros.
**Acannon**: You said did come by to get their yield measure done.
**Ahuettl**: They already did.
**Ahuettl**: I did it yesterday.
**Acannon**: Nice.
**Acannon**: How'd that epoxy go?
**Acannon**: Nice and smooth.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah.
**Ahuettl**: They may be finishing up the large bathrooms on Monday.
**Acannon**: I guess that's fine because.
**Acannon**: Well, it's a day to try.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah.
**Ahuettl**: One of the.
**Ahuettl**: One of the smaller restrooms.
**Acannon**: Because we'll have to get our diffusers Right.
**Acannon**: Dropped in there and sprinkler work done.
**Acannon**: Yeah, Wednesday probably makes more sense.
**Ahuettl**: Oh, boy.
**Ahuettl**: Here you go, Andrew.
**Ahuettl**: Here's your busy week.
**Ahuettl**: Oh, it's not that bad.
**Ahuettl**: All right.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah, that's a lot.
**Ahuettl**: This is the fun part that.
**Ahuettl**: This is what I love.
**Ahuettl**: I love when it's busy like this.
**Acannon**: Yeah, all that stuff, all those subs know what they're doing.
**Acannon**: They just need coordinated.
**Acannon**: SA.
**Ahuettl**: Nick, I'm going to share this with you too.
**Ahuettl**: This is.
**Ahuettl**: You can use this same thing for the OAC meeting on Tuesday.
**Ahuettl**: I'm going to send it to Andrew too, so that he has it.
**Acannon**: SA so the guy who.
**Acannon**: From MDC Group who called me yesterday, that's Rick's boss.
**Acannon**: I thought it was just like a regular project manager, so I told Rick, hey, we want that installed on 324.
**Ahuettl**: He's all right.
**Acannon**: Let me talk to my boss and we'll make sure we can do that.
**Ahuettl**: So 324, is that.
**Ahuettl**: Is that what, Monday?
**Acannon**: I mean, it's not the end of the world if.
**Acannon**: Oh, they don't get it in then.
**Ahuettl**: But I sent you the wrong date.
**Ahuettl**: But that's chewy.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, I know how to get those anyways.
**Ahuettl**: I know.
**Ahuettl**: I know you do.
**Ahuettl**: But I wanted Andrew to just have it.
**Acannon**: What is this, the two week look ahead?
**Ahuettl**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: And cns, they were billing a hundred percent through the end of this month.
**Speaker 2**: Do you.
**Speaker 2**: Do you guys have more for them to do after this month, do you think?
**Ahuettl**: No, they'll be done.
**Ahuettl**: They'll be done.
**Acannon**: Thermostats and dropping diffusers right now, other than that, I don't think really anything would be left unless they had to do anything in that exposed area.
**Acannon**: I know Jeff was going to get those clips taken down.
**Speaker 2**: So you guys, you.
**Speaker 2**: You think they'll be done at the end of this month?
**Ahuettl**: Yep, it'll be done.
**Ahuettl**: Okay.
**Speaker 2**: And same with Dean.
**Speaker 2**: They're.
**Speaker 2**: They're trying to build 100%.
**Ahuettl**: I wouldn't let them build 100 until fire alarm's done.
**Speaker 2**: Do you think that'll be done by the end of this month or you're not sure?
**Ahuettl**: I mean it.
**Ahuettl**: The plan is to have it done, but I, I wouldn't click approve it yet until.
**Acannon**: Yeah, I mean that's what at the end of the month is.
**Acannon**: They get all next week and then Monday.
**Acannon**: So again, I would hope they can get that done right, but.
**Acannon**: Yeah.
**Acannon**: No, don't.
**Acannon**: I would def.
**Acannon**: I agree.
**Acannon**: Don't.
**Acannon**: Don't let them bill until it's done.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah, I don't want to pay them then they're.
**Acannon**: They're doing fine with money, right?
**Acannon**: Like they can.
**Acannon**: They can wait.
**Ahuettl**: My girlfriend who started at Edwards today.
**Acannon**: So is that their competitor?
**Ahuettl**: Yeah.
**Ahuettl**: Edwards is what dean was before Dean De.
**Ahuettl**: De I guess apparently stands for death of Edwards electrical and mechanical.
**Ahuettl**: It's Gary.
**Ahuettl**: Gary Edwards owns Dean but insold Edwards Electrical and mechanical in 1992 start a dean.
**Acannon**: Do you get a history lesson from.
**Acannon**: From your girlfriend on this?
**Ahuettl**: No.

**Speaker 2**: It was like a sign.
