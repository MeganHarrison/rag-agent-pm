## Transcript
**Acannon**: Hey Maria, how are we done?
**Speaker 1**: Can you hear me?
**Acannon**: I can hear you.
**Speaker 1**: How was your vacation time?
**Speaker 1**: Good?
**Acannon**: It went well.
**Acannon**: Just trying to catch back up on time zone differences.
**Acannon**: Three hours behind.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, wow.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Did you had fun?
**Speaker 1**: It was.
**Speaker 1**: It was personal thing or.
**Acannon**: Yeah, it was.
**Acannon**: One of my buddies is getting married so we all went out on bachelor trip with them.
**Speaker 1**: Nice.
**Speaker 1**: Awesome.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, so let's go to these.
**Speaker 1**: So yesterday we review everything.
**Speaker 1**: I don't think you have access to the executive folder.
**Speaker 1**: So I'm just going to share this with you.
**Speaker 1**: So yesterday we talked to.
**Speaker 1**: I'm sharing the wrong thing.
**Speaker 1**: One second.
**Speaker 1**: We had a meeting with Brandon just to go over these things and make sure we have everything.
**Speaker 1**: Let me just share my entire screen.
**Speaker 1**: Here it is.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, so I'm here.
**Speaker 1**: So one second.
**Speaker 1**: So here we are.
**Speaker 1**: So let me go to my favorite.
**Speaker 1**: Let me go to the executive one and then Arkansas.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: So we are doing it based on this document, right?
**Speaker 1**: So the temporary commercial temporary licensing application.
**Speaker 1**: So copy of the current estate contractor license from another state or three completed references.
**Speaker 1**: So we already have this one.
**Speaker 1**: He said we can use a Florida one, so I already added to that one.
**Speaker 1**: So that's good.
**Acannon**: Perfect.
**Speaker 1**: 100 fill in fees.
**Speaker 1**: You said it's two.
**Speaker 1**: So accounting already sent those so I already have them in the folder.
**Acannon**: Perfect.
**Speaker 1**: We don't need the references because it says that you know.
**Speaker 1**: Or the three completed references.
**Speaker 1**: So we have the state rather than the three references.
**Speaker 1**: Complete questions one to seven, page two already.
**Speaker 1**: Brandon saw that so he said it's correct.
**Speaker 1**: Complete phase three certificate that must be obtained.
**Speaker 1**: That's already done.
**Speaker 1**: And then it says complete question one to seven, page seven.
**Speaker 1**: That's already done if applicable.
**Speaker 1**: It's not applicable to us because page number eight, it's about criminal check.
**Speaker 1**: Yes, correct.
**Speaker 1**: It says required financial statement.
**Speaker 1**: So we were reading this one and it says these financial requirements or the unrestricted commercial submit a bond in lieu.
**Speaker 1**: So this was already sent by Lisa.
**Speaker 1**: So we already have it.
**Speaker 1**: So we don't need the financial requirements now fully executed.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, that's done.
**Speaker 1**: And then it says if applying other than an individual, your entity's secretary of state information showing that the company is currently registered.
**Speaker 1**: So Brandon told me that it needs to be from Arkansas.
**Speaker 1**: If I'm not wrong, you are applying to that or.
**Speaker 1**: We haven't applied yet.
**Speaker 1**: I think we're working on something or.
**Acannon**: I haven't done anything with that one.
**Acannon**: No.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, so we need to do something about it.
**Speaker 1**: So it says if applying copy of your entity.
**Speaker 1**: Secretary of State information showing that the company is currently registered.
**Speaker 1**: So we need to register Alito in the Arkansas licensing application.
**Speaker 1**: I think, because he said that we usually go there and just apply.
**Acannon**: Oh, see, when I was reading that, I thought that was something within, you know, the state of Indiana or Florida where we have a permit.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Acannon**: Or where our business.
**Acannon**: Because I think tech is technically Alito Incorporated out of Indianapolis.
**Acannon**: So I think.
**Acannon**: So my understanding was it'd be something with the Secretary of state of Indiana.
**Acannon**: But I.
**Acannon**: I could be wrong.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So he said this license is only valid for 90 days.
**Speaker 1**: That's what we want.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Speaker 1**: So he said that usually we need to register to the Arkansas one.
**Speaker 1**: Because I.
**Speaker 1**: I actually thought it was the same.
**Speaker 1**: I actually said, wait, well, we have the.
**Speaker 1**: The Indianapolis one.
**Speaker 1**: But he said, I don't know.
**Speaker 1**: You're seeing this one.
**Acannon**: Brandon was saying Arkansas instead of.
**Speaker 1**: So he was saying.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, so he was saying, if applying older than an individual, remit a copy of your entity's secretary of state information showing that the company is currently registered applying with a dba also remit.
**Speaker 1**: Because we have this.
**Speaker 1**: So I'll show you.
**Speaker 1**: So we have the bond here.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Speaker 1**: So this is what we need to add to the package.
**Speaker 1**: This one.
**Speaker 1**: This is surely bond.
**Speaker 1**: So as you know, the certificate of existence from the state of Indiana office of the Secretary of state.
**Speaker 1**: So I thought that's the one from Aldo.
**Acannon**: That looks exactly like what I thought we would use.
**Speaker 1**: Exactly.
**Speaker 1**: So I already have it.
**Speaker 1**: So I already pasted here the existence.
**Acannon**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So I think that's what we need.
**Speaker 1**: And then the Florida license.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: That's what.
**Speaker 1**: What they needed.
**Speaker 1**: And then the contractor's license.
**Speaker 1**: I know.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: This is the checks for 100.
**Speaker 1**: This is the other check for.
**Speaker 1**: Or 100.
**Speaker 1**: And then they needed.
**Speaker 1**: I don't think we need this one.
**Speaker 1**: This is another document.
**Speaker 1**: But we're not doing it based on this one.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Speaker 1**: We're doing the temporary one and then the workers compensation.
**Speaker 1**: There's, you know, certificate.
**Acannon**: Sorry, I had something pop up.
**Acannon**: Could you go.
**Acannon**: What was that last one you were looking at?
**Speaker 1**: So no.
**Speaker 1**: So it's okay.
**Speaker 1**: So this one, I think this is the first one that we have, but we are doing and collecting everything based on the other document.
**Speaker 1**: Because this one is just asking for the exam and everything.
**Speaker 1**: So let me just delete this one because we don't need it right now.
**Speaker 1**: We are just doing everything based on the other document.
**Acannon**: Yeah, they want.
**Acannon**: They wanted.
**Acannon**: They told me they wanted both submitted.
**Acannon**: And that's why we need the 200 the two $100 checks.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, where does it get.
**Acannon**: There's $100 check for the one application and another $100 check for the other application.
**Speaker 1**: No way.
**Speaker 1**: So let me just move this one because it is already filled.
**Acannon**: Yeah, it's pretty much submitting two of the same, but if that's what they want, we'll do it.
**Acannon**: It's annoying, I think, but.
**Speaker 1**: So everything is already filled.
**Speaker 1**: And then.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, so we have these two.
**Speaker 1**: So that's why we have the two checks.
**Speaker 1**: And then in the other one, they needed the liability of insurance.
**Speaker 1**: So that's already done.
**Speaker 1**: So we have all the insurance for the.
**Speaker 1**: For them.
**Speaker 1**: Lisa already sent this to us, so what are we missing?
**Speaker 1**: So I honestly think that for this one, because it says your current here, your entity, Secretary of state information.
**Speaker 1**: So I think we already have it.
**Acannon**: I do still.
**Acannon**: I, I.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Acannon**: I personally think that's correct.
**Acannon**: How you did it.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, so this is done.
**Speaker 1**: So everything is already filled, as you can see.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, well, I know you're just seeing.
**Speaker 1**: I already have everything.
**Speaker 1**: There's the Social Security numbers.
**Speaker 1**: You already filled this out, so that's good.
**Speaker 1**: The references.
**Speaker 1**: We don't need these three, so that's good already.
**Speaker 1**: Brandon.
**Speaker 1**: So this one.
**Speaker 1**: So that's fine.
**Speaker 1**: This is okay.
**Speaker 1**: And we don't need the criminal background, so that's good.
**Speaker 1**: And this is the surety bond.
**Speaker 1**: So these is already filled, remember, by Lisa.
**Speaker 1**: So this page is done.
**Speaker 1**: So that's good.
**Speaker 1**: And now let's go with this one.
**Speaker 1**: So everything is already commercial application.
**Speaker 1**: So everything gets submitted here.
**Speaker 1**: This one I think we're missing, though I wasn't sure and I forgot to ask Brandon.
**Speaker 1**: So this is good.
**Acannon**: Yeah, we don't need any of that.
**Speaker 1**: Because we don't need this one.
**Speaker 1**: We don't need this one.
**Speaker 1**: We don't need this one.
**Speaker 1**: This is already.
**Speaker 1**: You're right.
**Speaker 1**: This is already filled.
**Speaker 1**: As you can see, the excess.
**Speaker 1**: So everything is filled.
**Speaker 1**: We don't need criminal background.
**Speaker 1**: This is already filled.
**Speaker 1**: And this is a surety bond, so we already have everything.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: And this is for the exam that we don't need.
**Speaker 1**: This is okay, so we're good.
**Speaker 1**: So we have everything.
**Speaker 1**: So now.
**Speaker 1**: So the thing is that we need to send this.
**Speaker 1**: So I'm pretty sure you might need to print this and send it from the office to them.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, so let me give you.
**Speaker 1**: I don't think I'm gonna.
**Speaker 1**: This is only.
**Speaker 1**: Let me just copy this one.
**Speaker 1**: Where should I send it to you?
**Speaker 1**: Because it is executive, so move to actually share yeah, actually, I think I.
**Speaker 1**: You can just.
**Speaker 1**: One second.
**Speaker 1**: Let me just share it with you and then let me just copy the link and let me make sure you got it.
**Speaker 1**: So what are you.
**Speaker 1**: Over here, Andrew.
**Speaker 1**: So can you click on it and make sure we have everything, please?
**Acannon**: Absolutely.
**Acannon**: Thank you for.
**Acannon**: Let me stop sharing this out with this.
**Speaker 1**: Of course.
**Speaker 1**: I keep nudging them every time it was like, brandon, check it out or I'm just gonna punch you on the face.
**Speaker 1**: And he's like, okay, I will.
**Speaker 1**: So he did.
**Speaker 1**: And I'm like, nice.

**Speaker 1**: Jesse was like, I need to study on the plane and I'm being told.
**Acannon**: Hey, I need to only focus on this job and this job, not this.

**Speaker 1**: I know, it's okay.
**Speaker 1**: And I was like, I'll help.
**Speaker 1**: I'll help you.
**Speaker 1**: Don't worry.
**Speaker 1**: But I was like, let's just have everything ready.
**Speaker 1**: So the only thing you do is just send it out because obviously I don't.
**Speaker 1**: I don't.
**Speaker 1**: I cannot send it from Colombia.
**Acannon**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Otherwise, trust me, I would have sent it.

**Acannon**: Yes.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Acannon**: I will get this taken care of.

**Speaker 1**: So everything is done.
**Speaker 1**: And don't forget, for the surety bond, l already filled out everything.
**Speaker 1**: So we need to send all the pages, including the invoice.
