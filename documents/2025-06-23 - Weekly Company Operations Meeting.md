**Ataylor**: Nick.
**Ataylor**: Goodwill Bart.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, it's gonna be down there on Friday.
**Jdawson**: And then some things came up about sprinkler coverage, so we reached out to Siemens for a response.
**Kmass**: What?
**Kmass**: What happened, Nick?
**Jdawson**: There's a company, Ryan Fire Production, that did an inspection and they determined that there's not adequate sprinkler coverage.
**Kmass**: Interesting.
**Kmass**: Is Siemens getting you what you need?
**Jdawson**: We just sent it to them today.

**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Goodwill Bloomington.
**Ataylor**: This is also you.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, Bloomington.
**Jdawson**: That bulb pricing.
**Jdawson**: The landlord has that.
**Jdawson**: He's looking at it, and then I think one of the tests was the canopy.
**Jdawson**: I did get pricing for that, and we may rework an existing canopy to save money, but we're looking at that.
**Ataylor**: Okay, so this is in progress, correct?
**Ataylor**: Order the awning for the front.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, in progress.

**Bclymer**: Yeah, aj.
**Kmass**: They're not on it right now, Nick.
**Ataylor**: Goodwill Corp.
**Ataylor**: Office car cut that.
**Jdawson**: So the civil engineer, he was reaching out to the city today or last week with some phone calls and an email, and they did not respond.
**Jdawson**: So I'm going to try to stop by the city this week and see if I can talk to them.
**Kmass**: Nick, are you in Indy this week?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I'll be there Wednesday, Thursday.
**Kmass**: Okay, let's.
**Kmass**: Well, I'll just catch up with you when you get into town.
**Kmass**: But, yeah, let me know how that goes.
**Kmass**: Going city and city of Indianapolis is hard, man.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I stopped in there one time before and I was able to talk to some people.
**Jdawson**: So hopefully that's the Same case.
**Kmass**: Okay, cool.
**Bclymer**: Thank you, Nick.
**Ataylor**: Glenn was Hill Collective.
**Njepson**: What's Westfield?
**Njepson**: I just have a few more contracts to write this week and I'm working about halfway through my submittals already.
**Njepson**: Same thing with Siemens.
**Njepson**: Can't get a hold of.
**Njepson**: Well, not necessarily.
**Njepson**: I can't hold up.
**Njepson**: I can't get what I need from Chris as far as this signed contract he's had for three and a half months.
**Jdawson**: I think Chris just works on too many projects and he's not able to get a hold of people.
**Njepson**: I guess he said that somebody is.
**Njepson**: Somebody's doing the final review and final signature, boss.
**Njepson**: And he's told me that for six weeks or so.
**Njepson**: I mean, he just.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, he always does that.
**Njepson**: It's frustrating.
**Kmass**: Well, I'll.
**Kmass**: I'll try and bump them guys, see what you see what we can do.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Kmass**: I don't know.
**Kmass**: I don't know why he's not answering.
**Njepson**: I don't either.
**Jdawson**: I mean, he's.
**Gducharme**: He.
**Njepson**: He can't.
**Njepson**: He won't confirm whether the spire suppression drawings even got sent to state or not yet.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: For like four months one time, and he never gave me an answer.
**Jdawson**: So I actually got a hold of some other people at their office and that they've been speaking to me so I can forward their info to you.
**Jdawson**: Glenn.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Kmass**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: Other than, other than that, everything is kind of in motion there.
**Njepson**: All the permitting is done.

**Njepson**: But Chad was out there on Saturday.
**Njepson**: The guys were out there doing foundations, trying to.
**Njepson**: Just trying to stay ahead of everything.
**Njepson**: But hopefully this weather is done for the year, this rain.
**Njepson**: Because really everything that we needed to get done on Westfield is, you know, barely get.
**Njepson**: Barely done in time for steel.
**Njepson**: But steel was the ultimate schedule.
**Njepson**: That's our critical path.
**Njepson**: So we were able to make that.
**Njepson**: We should be good for the rest of the project.

**Kmass**: Okay.
**Kmass**: Was.
**Kmass**: What was it within the budget that I gave him?
**Gducharme**: I need to compare, but it's.

**Gducharme**: For what he gave us for Brownsburg.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Gducharme**: And I'm pricing the material for.
**Gducharme**: For the platform, and I think we might need to add a little more because the design has changed from what your guide price for the platform, the wood.
