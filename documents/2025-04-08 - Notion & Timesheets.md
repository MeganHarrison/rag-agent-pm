## Transcript
**Megan**: I am.
**Fnjie**: Good.
**Accounting**: Nice.
**Megan**: I was about to, I was about to call you Megan.
**Megan**: I don't know why.
**Megan**: That was the first name that came to my head.
**Speaker 3**: I didn't know you have kids.
**Speaker 3**: How many kids do you have?
**Megan**: I have two.
**Speaker 3**: Oh, how old, how old are they?
**Megan**: Eleven.
**Megan**: Almost 12.
**Speaker 3**: And well, they're already grown ups.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Speaker 3**: Yes, they're grown ups already.
**Speaker 4**: So.
**Fnjie**: So.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Accounting**: Can you see it now?
**Megan**: Yes.
**Accounting**: Okay, so I have, I have this pulled up and then we can group it.
**Accounting**: So you need it by the job, right?
**Megan**: By employee, I believe.
**Speaker 3**: Yes.
**Accounting**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: Yes.
**Speaker 3**: I think they submitted by employee.
**Speaker 3**: I think so.
**Accounting**: I don't think in acumatica you do it by employee.
**Megan**: In acumatica, yes.
**Megan**: We will have to do it by employee to be able to tie out the net pay for each employee and like the deductions, contributions.
**Accounting**: Okay so then I would have different, I would set up different views here.
**Accounting**: But this is going to show you all of the different employees and then you can also group it by the jobs.
**Accounting**: So let me do that real quick.
**Accounting**: But I guess you don't really want it.
**Accounting**: You don't want it grouped by the jobs, just by employee?
**Megan**: Yeah, I think grouping it by employee will be better.
**Megan**: That will be easiest way to tie out to.
**Fnjie**: The report.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Accounting**: Then I would go in here and create a different view for all of the employees that you can jump back and forth to or you can have a filter just on the very first one that you toggle based on person.
**Accounting**: So if I only want to see like AJ's then his are going to show up here.
**Accounting**: There's nothing there because nothing is entered.
**Accounting**: But like Brandon shows that there's, he's gonna have all his time here.
**Accounting**: So imagine everything was listed and then you could group it, you could group it by the, the job as well.
**Accounting**: Or you can have another view that you set up.
**Accounting**: And so that's going to be like okay, this is all Brandon's time as a total here.
**Accounting**: And then it's going to have the total for each project shown up and then I guess we'd want another filter for the status.
**Accounting**: So you only want things that have been submitted to show up.
**Accounting**: But because nothing's been submitted, nothing's there.
**Accounting**: So I'm going to have it as not started as well.
**Accounting**: So their job.
**Accounting**: Let me go to another.
**Accounting**: Another.
**Accounting**: It works exactly the same way as the credit cards would.
**Accounting**: The credit cards are going to show up.
**Accounting**: I guess the only difference is the credit cards are auto populated where they're going and actually entering the timesheet so because I have.
**Accounting**: I entered fake time for these.
**Accounting**: It's showing all the time I've submitted and then the total here.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Accounting**: So they fill in their Costco and the time and the date and then they're responsible for changing the.
**Accounting**: When they hit submit, then it changes the status automatically.
**Accounting**: So if I'm like submit now, I'm not seeing that anymore because committed to leadership to approve.
**Accounting**: If.
**Accounting**: Because Brandon told me that or someone told me, I can't remember that it needs to be approved first before it gets coded.
**Accounting**: Is that true or no?
**Megan**: Yeah, the time needs to be approved.
**Megan**: Yes, before it gets.
**Accounting**: And who's approving it?
**Megan**: I believe Brandon, right?
**Speaker 4**: Yes, Brandon.
**Accounting**: Okay, so after they hit submit, it's going to go away from here.
**Accounting**: All the submitted ones are going to show up on Brandon's just like all of the submitted accounting or all the submitting credit cards do pull approve it and then it would then show up on like I can change this filter to only show the submitted ones for you here.
**Accounting**: Is there any other information that you.
**Speaker 4**: What is Brandon's view upon approving?
**Speaker 4**: Because currently what he is approving right now is per employee.
**Speaker 4**: We have the timesheet per employee.
**Speaker 4**: And then he's going to approve it.
**Accounting**: Yeah, I mean the power of notion is you can have it however you want.
**Accounting**: So he can change it to be whatever view he wants it to be.
**Accounting**: Like if he wants to see it grouped by the employees, then it'll be grouped by the employees.
**Accounting**: If he wants to see it grouped by the project and he can group it by the project like it's all the same data.
**Accounting**: You can just customize it to be however.
**Accounting**: However you want to see it.
**Accounting**: So I'm assuming he'll have it like that, like this with the by person or by employee.
**Accounting**: But he can also have two views.
**Accounting**: Like you can duplicate it.
**Accounting**: And so like here, this groups it automatically by the total hours.
**Accounting**: So if all you needed to do is have the total number of hours and not the number of people, then you can see the total for each of the jobs.
**Accounting**: And you can also add a date filter.
**Accounting**: Like everything can be customized right here in this filter field by adding a new filter and then just setting it to be however you want it to however you want to see it.
**Speaker 4**: Does that make sense for that filter in the lower portion?
**Speaker 4**: Can we add per person the project total hours?
**Speaker 4**: Like, can we add it per person and then we can filter it by date?
**Speaker 4**: Would that be possible?
**Accounting**: Yeah, I believe.
**Accounting**: Yeah, you could.
**Accounting**: It makes it difficult when you don't have any information in here because it's like, it's not going to show.
**Accounting**: Like, it's hard to.
**Accounting**: It's hard to like see it.
**Accounting**: But if that's what the top one is too.
**Accounting**: If we.
**Accounting**: Or add a grouping, I guess this.
**Accounting**: If we change the grouping from person to job type or job name, I would recommend it having probably two different views.
**Accounting**: This one's grouped by the first group by the job and the second one you could have group by project.
**Accounting**: And then I would change this instead of being a job name to the person.
**Accounting**: And so now you have it by employee, then you have it by job.
**Accounting**: You could also create one of these for each individual employee.
**Megan**: I have a question.
**Megan**: If you create it for each individual employee, will it give you the summary at the bottom of the total per job by.
**Megan**: I mean for that specific employee?
**Megan**: Like for example, if we have Brandon, when we scroll down to the bottom, is it going to give us the job summary or the total charge per job?
**Megan**: Yeah, it looks like it does.
**Megan**: Right?
**Megan**: That's.
**Megan**: Is that it at the bottom?
**Accounting**: That's a different.
**Accounting**: That's a different view.
**Accounting**: But this is by job.
**Accounting**: So like you have, you can, you can collapse these.
**Accounting**: But.
**Accounting**: So this is showing you.
**Accounting**: Okay, there, this is just for Brandon and it's grouped by the project.
**Accounting**: There's eight hours.
**Accounting**: Again, like if there's actually data in here, it's going to make it way easier.
**Accounting**: So I recommend just like going in and putting in a bunch of data because you can't.
**Accounting**: There's nothing you can mess up.
**Fnjie**: Like.
**Accounting**: Okay, like actually put it in as if time was in there.
**Accounting**: It's going to make a lot more sense.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Accounting**: And so the date would.
**Accounting**: The date would have been filled in.
**Accounting**: The status would be changed to approve.
**Accounting**: Like this is how it would look when it actually goes to you and the job and the cost code would be filled in.
**Accounting**: So they're responsible for doing the exact same thing that they do on this spreadsheet currently is how I set it up.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Accounting**: So now when you're in Brandon's view, this is what you would see.
**Fnjie**: Because.
**Accounting**: You don't even need.
**Accounting**: What's the extra for?
**Accounting**: I forget.
**Speaker 4**: Yeah, I think we have added for dime.
**Speaker 4**: I asked Maria to add that one last time because she will be needing that as well in our payroll.
**Accounting**: What could.
**Accounting**: What, what do they enter in here?
**Speaker 4**: I am not sure for that one, but we only have added per dime.
**Speaker 4**: And also I asked Maria to add a PTO as well.
**Speaker 3**: Oh yeah.
**Speaker 3**: So the per diem column is next to the submitted date.
**Speaker 3**: We can move it, Megan, if you want to.
**Speaker 3**: Exactly.
**Speaker 3**: And then the.
**Accounting**: What is the move things around, because this is your view.
**Accounting**: Like, you can have it however you want.
**Accounting**: Like, you're the only one working in this page.
**Accounting**: Like, you can move anything however you want.
**Accounting**: It doesn't affect.
**Accounting**: Like, if we go back over to.
**Accounting**: If we go back over to the dashboard for the users, like, anything that you change there, it doesn't affect anything here as long as you're not, like, deleting things that they submitted.
**Accounting**: But changing the views on your view doesn't change anything on theirs.
**Speaker 3**: Okay, so for the extra number, what is it for?
**Speaker 3**: Fritzi, do we need the extra or can we change it to PTO or.
**Speaker 4**: I don't think so, because we only need per dime and then the pto.
**Speaker 4**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: So no extra.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Accounting**: So go ahead and put.
**Accounting**: Put some of that in there so you can see, like, if it's set up how you want it to be.
**Accounting**: This is a lot easier than trying to, like, guess the.
**Accounting**: Visualizing it.
**Accounting**: So if someone submitted per diem, put an example in there now and then see if that's going to show.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Speaker 3**: Pretty.
**Speaker 3**: You want to go and put the time and everything just as a test.
**Accounting**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: Get comfortable with, like, adding things here.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, we need to test it out now.
**Speaker 3**: So if you have some things that we cannot.
**Megan**: If you don't want to use one of the guys, you can just use.
**Megan**: Use me, since I don't have time that way, you know, to go back and delete it if you see my name.
**Fnjie**: Oh, okay.
**Megan**: Yeah.
**Megan**: Excuse me.
**Accounting**: As a test, they haven't used this at all, so.
**Megan**: Okay.
**Accounting**: Like, the only things that are in here, things that we were putting in.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Megan**: Maria, what about the.
**Megan**: The.
**Megan**: The truck allowances?
**Megan**: Do they get that, you know, separate, or is that.
**Speaker 3**: If we can.
**Speaker 3**: As much as we can add on the timesheets in terms of allowances and everything.
**Speaker 3**: So payroll can have information.
**Megan**: All the information.
**Megan**: Okay.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: So if we need to re.
**Speaker 3**: You know, like, reorganize these and make it, like, better for everybody and to have something that can gather all the information will be better.
**Accounting**: But the truck allowances is the same every single month, isn't it?
**Megan**: I believe so, yes.
**Accounting**: Like, it's not something that needs to be added.
**Accounting**: Like, they get $500, I think $500 a month for the truck allowance?
**Speaker 3**: I think so, yeah.
**Speaker 4**: So is it a fix in the bureau, that allowance?
**Accounting**: No, but that's what.
**Speaker 3**: That's why they were asking if we can add it as, you know, if it's fixed.
**Speaker 3**: Let's add it as fixed on the payroll.
**Speaker 3**: If it's something the guys are not using or like, something like that, we can change it.
**Speaker 3**: For example, the per diem as well.
**Speaker 3**: So if they're using it, I think there's a maximum.
**Speaker 3**: Right.
**Speaker 4**: If I'm the wrong.
**Speaker 3**: Like, per diem is like 80 per day or I don't know how much is it.
**Speaker 3**: So like six to eight.
**Accounting**: Yeah, it is.
**Accounting**: It's different.
**Accounting**: I mean, that would probably be a completely different.
**Accounting**: That would be like a completely different.
**Speaker 3**: Amount.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Accounting**: Add to their dashboard.
**Accounting**: I think that would work the best where there's.
**Accounting**: But if it's.
**Accounting**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: 80 per day, then they would have.
**Accounting**: What would that be called?
**Accounting**: Reimbursements or.
**Speaker 3**: Yes, correct.
**Megan**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: So I could create another one of these, like, for reimbursements, and then I could have it pull in the time with a relation field.
**Accounting**: So there's these things.
**Fnjie**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: Then another column would show up here that had the reimbursement or whatever you want to call it, totals next to it for each date.
**Speaker 3**: Okay.
**Speaker 4**: Where can they input the PTO Here?
**Accounting**: I believe Maria said that that would be her dm.
**Accounting**: I.
**Accounting**: I don't know.
**Accounting**: We.
**Speaker 3**: We can.
**Speaker 3**: We can add it as a per DM if you guys want to, or we can add another one as PTO as well.
**Speaker 3**: What is it better?
**Speaker 3**: Whatever is more comfortable for you.
**Speaker 3**: Fritzi and I think.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, Yeah, I think we want to call them for pto.
**Speaker 3**: We can add.
**Accounting**: What's per diem?
**Accounting**: Like, what would someone enter here?
**Megan**: So per diem will be, like sometimes.
**Megan**: A lot of times if they.
**Megan**: They travel, you get like $80 a day for traveling.
**Accounting**: Okay, so that will be a different one.
**Megan**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: And I'll change this to pto.
**Megan**: Yeah, but I.
**Megan**: Yeah, but I think we do need to have per diem on there also.
**Accounting**: Well, no, because, I mean, I will.
**Accounting**: I'll create a different one, then pulls it in with the per diem.
**Accounting**: But it's not the same thing as submitting time.
**Accounting**: That's completely different.
**Accounting**: Like, I can pull in there.
**Speaker 4**: I think we can just integrate the paradigm in the timesheet.
**Accounting**: Yeah, it'll be a different timesheet or a different.
**Accounting**: Different.
**Speaker 3**: Just a different column.
**Accounting**: And then it's going to pull in the.
**Accounting**: For DM time when that's filled out into a different.
**Speaker 3**: Now, Megan, I do have a question.
**Speaker 3**: Well, free to find some information to put there.
**Speaker 3**: So the job name have to be in the active jobs.
**Speaker 3**: And you Told me how to do it.
**Speaker 3**: So when I try to duplicate the active jobs, the projects divided between the estimated and the active projects.
**Speaker 3**: When I duplicate it, it doesn't allow me to click on with.
**Speaker 3**: With content.
**Speaker 3**: So what it does is it duplicate entire thing except the task.
**Speaker 3**: The tasks.
**Speaker 3**: So I'm not sure if I'm missing something or if we.
**Speaker 3**: How to duplicate it with the tasks in it.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: So if you see there's something that it says test, so that's the project.
**Speaker 3**: That's awesome.
**Speaker 3**: And then all the way down is something that's called test.
**Speaker 3**: So that big test, if you click there a little bit up resources above the.
**Speaker 3**: That's the one.
**Speaker 3**: So you will see the projects like everything is the same projects that I duplicated.
**Speaker 3**: But the only thing is it doesn't have the tasks inside the project because.
**Accounting**: The tasks are associated with the other.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: So I don't know.
**Speaker 3**: If you open any project, you will notice that it's empty compared to the normal ones.
**Speaker 3**: Oh, it was that.
**Speaker 3**: That's it.
**Accounting**: So it's.
**Accounting**: It's showing how.
**Accounting**: It's showing the tasks assigned to this also.
**Speaker 3**: But wait, what did you do?
**Speaker 3**: So it was hidden?
**Accounting**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: So you can change the views to be however you want it to be.
**Accounting**: Because it would get really overwhelming like if everything was here.
**Accounting**: But if I did show all.
**Speaker 3**: Gotcha.
**Speaker 3**: All right, so if you open.
**Speaker 3**: Let's click on one project.
**Speaker 3**: Okay.
**Speaker 3**: So those are the tasks.
**Speaker 3**: Okay, perfect.
**Speaker 3**: No, that's awesome.
**Speaker 4**: I have question.
**Speaker 4**: Is this a job?
**Speaker 4**: Where did we get this job number?
**Accounting**: They're entering that.
**Accounting**: So just like they would do exactly like they would do on the spreadsheet or like on the spreadsheets that you're currently using, they have to enter the job and the.
**Accounting**: The time and so it automatic.
**Accounting**: So when they enter the job name, then the job, it's automatically tied to the job number.
**Accounting**: Marie.
**Accounting**: It's because this filter is here.
**Speaker 3**: Yes.
**Accounting**: And it's set up to be filtered for the other.
**Accounting**: The other spreadsheet.
**Accounting**: So.
**Accounting**: Oh, wait, notice this task.
**Accounting**: It's filtered to be.
**Accounting**: This is showing Goodwill Bloomington.
**Speaker 3**: I don't know why.
**Accounting**: And then.
**Accounting**: Oops.
**Speaker 4**: So this is.
**Speaker 4**: This is not the code that we are currently having in Job Planner and procore.
**Speaker 4**: The job number.
**Accounting**: It should be because.
**Accounting**: So you're Sam.
**Accounting**: Yeah, yeah.
**Accounting**: This is tied to.
**Speaker 4**: Okay, so maybe way back before.
**Speaker 4**: Because this 24106 is correct.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Speaker 4**: Yeah.
**Speaker 4**: I think it's an old job.
**Accounting**: This is one of those relation fields I was telling you about.
**Accounting**: So when I have the When I set the thing up for the per diem, it would show up.
**Accounting**: But this is.
**Accounting**: They're adding the.
**Accounting**: The job name and it's automatically tied to the job number.
**Accounting**: So if there was something that wasn't correct, it would mean that this.
**Accounting**: This database wasn't correct because it's impossible to like.
**Accounting**: Whenever they choose this name, it's pulling in this job number.
**Accounting**: We actually don't need this anymore.
**Megan**: I think, because the job number format.
**Megan**: And you see how towards the end there's like 25, 108, 25, 107.
**Megan**: That is the correct job number formatting.
**Megan**: So I'm not sure what the 25.0.3.05 is.
**Megan**: That looks more like a date.
**Accounting**: This was the formatting that Acumatica needed for this.
**Accounting**: Like when you submit had to be in this.
**Accounting**: This format in Acumatica, otherwise it wouldn't work.
**Megan**: Because the current job number formatted in acumatica is the 25108.
**Accounting**: Let me go back to your accounting.
**Accounting**: Oops, that's not it.
**Accounting**: Where are transactions?
**Accounting**: Yeah, Ready for export project number Costco.
**Accounting**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: However it is on here is how Acumatica needed it to be.
**Megan**: Yeah, yeah.
**Megan**: So it's the two.
**Megan**: The two numbers for the year dash, the three numbers.
**Accounting**: Okay, so I'll change the view to be showing this one right here in the top.
**Megan**: Oh, sorry.
**Megan**: Go ahead.
**Accounting**: So we're in projects.
**Accounting**: I'll change it to be.
**Accounting**: To pull in that view.
**Megan**: Okay.
**Accounting**: What was your question?
**Megan**: My question?
**Accounting**: Yeah, I thought.
**Accounting**: I thought you're gonna have.
**Accounting**: I thought you were gonna ask something.
**Megan**: Oh, yeah, but it was related to the credit cards.
**Megan**: I just, you know, I just thought about something.
**Megan**: But a credit card.
**Megan**: That's why I stopped myself.
**Megan**: It wasn't related to this.
**Accounting**: Yeah, let me look to see how I have it.
**Accounting**: Actually, I think.
**Accounting**: Well, this one's correct.
**Accounting**: These are just old.
**Accounting**: That's why.
**Megan**: Okay, those are.
**Megan**: Okay.
**Megan**: Okay, those are old.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Accounting**: Makes sense.
**Accounting**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: What.
**Accounting**: What's like an active job that you have right now?
**Speaker 3**: Let's do.
**Speaker 3**: Let's try to find Seminal Collective if you want to.
**Speaker 3**: Or I think that's an estimate.
**Speaker 3**: Or Westfield Collective.
**Accounting**: Whatever works for you.
**Megan**: Think Westfield Collective is a more recent one.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, Westfield Collective.
**Fnjie**: Yeah.
**Megan**: Yep.
**Fnjie**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: So this way, if you just add, like the test data in here with the real stuff, I think it'll make it a lot easier to see if everything's working exactly how you need it to be.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Megan**: Can we identify active jobs in here to avoid anybody?
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, so that was the issue.
**Speaker 3**: We Wanted to fix with.
**Speaker 3**: I know Megan suggested it before, so that's the issue with what we were fixing right now.
**Speaker 3**: So the idea is to have two databases, so the estimated one and the active one.
**Speaker 3**: So right now the projects are just one tab.
**Speaker 3**: So that's when I wanted.
**Speaker 3**: I think you wanted to show me how to filter with the active jobs.
**Accounting**: Yeah, I'm going to go in there after we get off just so I can concentrate and make sure I'm not.
**Accounting**: I don't mess anything up.
**Accounting**: But.
**Accounting**: So this one is going to be the estimating now?
**Speaker 3**: Yes, if you want to.
**Speaker 3**: I'll be estimating and then the projects.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, that will be estimated.
**Speaker 3**: And then what we need is just to have the tasks, because that was the issue.
**Speaker 3**: I couldn't, you know, get the tasks.
**Speaker 3**: The tasks that are in the projects database.
**Accounting**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: So.
**Accounting**: Okay, so phase is not a thing.
**Accounting**: Okay, So I will do that after we get off.
**Accounting**: But like now this is just going to have the estimating.
**Accounting**: So we don't even need this phase anymore.
**Speaker 3**: Okay, perfect.
**Speaker 3**: So then once, once that is, that's fixed.
**Speaker 3**: Fatima, you will have only the active jobs in the timesheets.
**Speaker 3**: So you will know exactly that those are the active jobs.
**Speaker 3**: So you don't, you know, you don't have problems with the estimated ones.
**Fnjie**: So.
**Megan**: Okay, sounds good.
**Accounting**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: Any other questions?
**Accounting**: I'll start over with the estimate with this one, just to make sure there wasn't anything else added to it and it's real time in the jobs.
**Accounting**: And then.
**Accounting**: And then I'll have this one just be the estimating and the other one be the.
**Accounting**: The active jobs.
**Speaker 3**: Okay, Perfect.
**Speaker 3**: Free to any more questions.
**Speaker 3**: You guys are more comfortable, you know, with the timesheets and everything.
**Speaker 3**: We need to enter some data as Megan suggested, just to make sure everything is working properly.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Speaker 4**: My question is, what is the employee's view with this?
**Speaker 4**: I mean, like, if Jesse will.
**Speaker 4**: Will enter his timesheet, what is their view?
**Accounting**: So if you go to my dashboard, you're going to see yours just like they would see theirs, but it's going to be with your data.
**Accounting**: So if you want, and you can go in and put time just like I did here.
**Accounting**: This is the view.
**Accounting**: So I just took all the fields that were exactly how they were on the spreadsheet and then displayed it here.
**Accounting**: So if they are adding, like today, I'm gonna be like, okay, well, it's today.
**Accounting**: I'm gonna assign the job and I'm gonna say that's eight hours.
**Accounting**: Then I'll probably wait till the whole week is over.
**Accounting**: And then go and submit these all for approval.
**Accounting**: So now they're gonna.
**Accounting**: They would disappear.
**Accounting**: I submitted them to get paid and then we added this PTO one just.
**Accounting**: Just now.
**Accounting**: So until I move that, I don't know what extra is.
**Speaker 4**: Can we just edit the extra to per diem so that they can enter it as well?
**Accounting**: There have to do separately.
**Accounting**: It wouldn't make sense to add per diem here because they're not.
**Accounting**: I mean, I guess is per diem added or assigned to a job?
**Speaker 4**: Yes.
**Accounting**: Okay then yeah, we can change this to per diem.
**Megan**: So everything on the timesheets or any is will be assigned to a job.
**Accounting**: Yep.
**Accounting**: So then I guess they would.
**Megan**: Yeah.
**Speaker 4**: If it's pto, there's no job.
**Megan**: Yeah, yeah, it's pto.
**Speaker 4**: Then if they will click pto, there should be no job for there.
**Accounting**: Okay, so then they just wouldn't assign a job.
**Accounting**: So yeah, I get.
**Accounting**: I.
**Accounting**: I guess then I would put eight hours of PTO and no job.
**Accounting**: But the date would be like say I had on 11th.
**Speaker 4**: Can we move the job code together with the job name?
**Accounting**: Yep, you can move up however you want.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Accounting**: Like this is just for their view.
**Accounting**: You're not they.
**Accounting**: But on.
**Accounting**: On the accounting dashboard, like you can.
**Accounting**: As long as you're not deleting stuff, it's not going to affect anything on anyone else's.
**Accounting**: So if you want the job number to be right there or like that, you can do that if you want this to be at the top and then this is exactly still the same.
**Speaker 4**: Okay.
**Speaker 4**: Maybe we can just create that filter or report once we have the data.
**Accounting**: The filter for what?
**Speaker 4**: If you are going to custom the data that you will be needing.
**Accounting**: If you're going to what?
**Speaker 4**: We will customize the data that you will be needing once we have that data coming from the employee.
**Accounting**: Yeah, so just go ahead and put the employee's time in it now.
**Accounting**: Like it's not gonna.
**Accounting**: You can delete everything afterwards.
**Accounting**: But go in and put Jesse's.
**Accounting**: Put AJ's like test data and then you can play around with the filters to set it up exactly how you want.
**Accounting**: So when it is real, it's exactly how you need it to be.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Speaker 4**: I think that's the only from my side.
**Speaker 4**: How about you, Fatima?
**Megan**: Yeah, that's it for me.
**Accounting**: Okay, well, once you play around with it, let me know what questions you have and then Maria, I'll duplicate the other project 1.
**Accounting**: I'll do the project.
**Accounting**: Yes, databases.
**Speaker 3**: Thank you, Megan.
**Speaker 3**: So So you don't.
**Speaker 3**: You don't want to test it out now?
**Speaker 3**: Just for, like, test.
**Speaker 3**: I mean, it's okay.
**Speaker 3**: We put data.
**Speaker 3**: We can always delete it afterwards or everything if you guys want to test it out.
**Speaker 3**: Now with Megan here, did you want to click?
**Fnjie**: Yeah.
**Megan**: I mean, it.
**Megan**: I think it may be best if she just, you know, just take your time and try out different things, and if they don't work, then, you know, if you have any additional questions, then just put it in an email and then, you know, just send it to Megan.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Speaker 3**: Okay, Megan, thank you so much for your help.
**Speaker 3**: And then, yeah, just let me know when the other things are ready so we can start using them.
**Speaker 3**: And if we have more questions, I'll keep bothering you.
**Speaker 3**: Thank you so much.
**Accounting**: Sounds good.
**Accounting**: I'm going to add this first one will be grouped by employee, and then.
**Speaker 3**: Okay.
**Accounting**: Or wait, group by job.
**Accounting**: And then I'll create another one, group by employee.
**Accounting**: So you can toggle.
**Accounting**: Toggle back and forth to each of them.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Speaker 3**: Okay, perfect.
**Accounting**: All right, bye, guys.
**Speaker 3**: Okay, thank you.
**Speaker 3**: Thank you, guys.
**Speaker 3**: Thank you, Megan.
**Speaker 3**: We'll be in touch soon.
**Speaker 3**: Bye.
**Speaker 3**: Bye.
**Speaker 3**: By.
