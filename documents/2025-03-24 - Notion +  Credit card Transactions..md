## Transcript
**Allcompany**: Sorry, guys.
**Allcompany**: I'll have to sit in on this meeting.
**Accounting**: I haven't been tracking my credit card receipts for damn near a year now.
**Fred**: Oh, boy.
**Accounting**: I'm just kidding.
**Allcompany**: I only.
**Accounting**: I have zero receipts.
**Accounting**: I haven't learned how to even do it yet.
**Fnjie**: I figured it out last week.
**Fnjie**: It's pretty easy.
**Acannon**: I have a whopping 3.
**Accounting**: I knew we were going to get like a Excel sheet or something, but then we talked in the meeting about getting it on Notion and then Andrew showed me where it was, but I.
**Accounting**: I couldn't find it again on my own.
**Accounting**: I have nothing in there anyways.
**Accounting**: Good morning, Maria.
**Ctragesser**: Hi, guys.
**Ctragesser**: Can you hear me?
**Fnjie**: Yes, we can.
**Allcompany**: Yeah.
**Ctragesser**: Nice.
**Ctragesser**: One second.
**Fnjie**: Starbucks it is.
**Crusin**: What's up, Nick?
**Fnjie**: How's it going?
**Allcompany**: Good.
**Crusin**: How are you doing?
**Fred**: Good.
**Fnjie**: You say you're going to Starbucks, Alex?
**Crusin**: Oh, I just needed to pull over.
**Crusin**: How long of a drive you got, Alex?
**Fnjie**: Two hours and 15 minutes from the airport.
**Ctragesser**: Hi, accounting team.
**Ctragesser**: Hello.
**Ctragesser**: Are you ready, ladies?
**Ctragesser**: So, I think he's missing Jesse.
**Ctragesser**: I know.
**Ctragesser**: No one's like, all right, Jesse's here.
**Ctragesser**: Who's missing?
**Ctragesser**: AJ Is on a plane.
**Ctragesser**: Who else?
**Ctragesser**: Nick, Camden, Glenn, Chad.
**Fnjie**: Jesse's here.
**Ctragesser**: Alex is here.
**Ctragesser**: Okay, I think we're good.
**Ctragesser**: Perfect.
**Ctragesser**: So, Fatima, do you want.
**Ctragesser**: So the thing with this is we were actually.
**Ctragesser**: Andrew.
**Ctragesser**: I don't know if Andrew is going to connect.
**Ctragesser**: It's missing Andrew.
**Crusin**: Oh, yeah.
**Crusin**: I was gonna say.
**Ctragesser**: Anyway, we can share the recording.
**Ctragesser**: So, Fatima, the question is how you guys are entering the tracks, the transactions, or the codes that the guys.
**Ctragesser**: I mean, how they are supposed to post them on Notion so they don't get fire.
**Fred**: I hope nobody gets fired.
**Ctragesser**: Exactly.
**Ctragesser**: So can you show us how to do that, please?
**Fred**: So have any of you guys tried it?
**Fred**: Has anybody logged into Notion yet?
**Ctragesser**: Okay, Alex did.
**Ctragesser**: Okay.
**Fred**: Okay.
**Fred**: What of.
**Fred**: Yeah.
**Fred**: So I just wanted to know what are some of the difficulties you guys are experiencing with the coding?
**Fnjie**: The only difficulty I'm having right now is getting my receipts that are in OneDrive over into Notion.
**Fred**: Over into Notion?
**Fred**: Yeah.
**Fnjie**: Other than that, it's pretty simple.
**Fred**: That's what it is.
**Fred**: Okay.
**Fred**: You were saying something canden, but you unmuted, so we can't hear you.
**Crusin**: That would help.
**Allcompany**: Okay.
**Crusin**: Yeah.
**Crusin**: So I guess my only thing is.
**Crusin**: So, accounting, we make a purchase on the credit card, we keep the receipt, we file that wherever we want to file that in the receipt folder for the job.
**Crusin**: And then you guys will get that transaction and you guys will upload that to Notions, and then we will get a notification.
**Fred**: Yes, so the transactions come in directly from the bank.
**Fred**: I think on a daily or weekly basis, the load from the bank.
**Fred**: So as soon as you swipe your credit card, give it a few days, you will see those transactions in Notion.
**Fred**: So what you have to do, maybe right after you make the purchase, maybe take a picture of it on your phone, you can email it to yourself, but you'll get another.
**Fred**: You'll get a.
**Fred**: You'll get a notification from Notion saying, hey, you have these transactions under your name that you need to go in and code.
**Fred**: At that point, you go in, you enter the code in, and then you can attach the receipt.
**Crusin**: Okay, so when you say enter the code in.
**Crusin**: So yeah, we, we can go into coded, you maybe share your screen.
**Accounting**: Fatima?
**Fred**: Yes, yes, I'm logging in right now.
**Ctragesser**: I want to share.
**Ctragesser**: I'm going to start recording.
**Ctragesser**: Okay, guys, just so you know.
**Allcompany**: Go.
**Fred**: Right here.
**Fred**: Are you guys able to see my screen?
**Allcompany**: Yep.
**Ctragesser**: Yes.
**Fred**: Okay, so I, I can see everybody's.
**Fred**: But for example, whoever it is, you know, maybe Kendon, you'll see your, your transactions with your name right, right here.
**Fred**: If it says.
**Fred**: And it will say imported.
**Fred**: Imported means that it just came in.
**Fred**: So it's not coded.
**Fred**: Now if you click on it.
**Fred**: Actually, let's see, I'm gonna use AJ's, for example, this is where you will go in this.
**Fred**: This is the transaction amount.
**Fred**: This is where you will enter the project name in here and the cost code in the next cell and the cost type right here.
**Fred**: And when you click here, you can choose a file and attach your receipt.
**Accounting**: Is the Costco imported from our budget?
**Fred**: I believe so.
**Fred**: Let's try this.
**Accounting**: Is there a drop down to select the Costco or do you input it individually?
**Fred**: I think you can drop down.
**Fred**: So aj, this transaction for Home, Home Depot, let's use that.
**Fred**: Let's use that one as an example.
**Fred**: For 4284, March 3rd.
**Fred**: You remember what that was for?
**Ctragesser**: So AJ is not connected.
**Ctragesser**: So let's try, for example, let's try for another one.
**Crusin**: I don't know that one right, right below it that Alex has right there.
**Fred**: Yeah, Is Alex on the call?
**Fnjie**: Yeah, I'm here.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Fred**: All right, let's use Alex.
**Fred**: So Alex right here, he has goodwill.
**Fred**: Bart, Costcode will auto populate.
**Fred**: Let's try the cost type it.
**Fnjie**: It did not auto populate, but if I type in truck, it.
**Fnjie**: It pulls up truck fuel.
**Fnjie**: That, that's what it was for.
**Fnjie**: So click that.
**Fnjie**: And then it was an expense.
**Fnjie**: And then I threw a receipt in there.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Fred**: All right, well, maybe we can talk to Megan to see about, you know, making the cost type auto populate too, because those are already.
**Accounting**: It doesn't need to.
**Allcompany**: I just was curious if it did.
**Allcompany**: Yeah, they would be in the budget.
**Accounting**: If you already built your budget out.
**Fred**: Okay.
**Fred**: Okay, well, it'll make.
**Accounting**: But I just.
**Accounting**: I didn't know if it.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Fred**: Side.
**Fred**: Yeah.
**Fred**: So right after that, in this receipt cell, you can just click on it and find a, you know, and attach your receipt.
**Crusin**: So now.
**Crusin**: Now Alex now has to go back.
**Crusin**: So if you scroll back to the left to where the names are, now Alex has to go back into where it says imported and switch that to coded.
**Crusin**: That then takes it out of the ball, out of his court, and he's completely done with that receipt right now.
**Crusin**: It still says imported.
**Crusin**: So it's still in his court.
**Fred**: Yes, correct.
**Fred**: All right, so once he changes it to coded, then it goes to Brandon for approval.
**Fred**: And once Brandon approves it, then it comes to our end for us to import into Acumatica.
**Crusin**: Gotcha.
**Allcompany**: Does it automatically go to Brandon or once you input the code or do we have to send it?
**Crusin**: I think it automatically goes to them.
**Ctragesser**: Yes, it goes automatically.
**Ctragesser**: Yeah, it has like a connection with Brandon.
**Fred**: Brandon, yeah.
**Allcompany**: Okay, so we just put the job.
**Allcompany**: The job name the code expense and it kicks off.
**Allcompany**: We don't mess with the imported or approved tab.
**Fred**: Because I'm seeing Alex is here.
**Fred**: It has all the items, but it still says imported.
**Fnjie**: So I need to change that.
**Fred**: Then you may have to code it.
**Fred**: To code it.
**Fred**: Yes, once you change it, Fatima, can.
**Ctragesser**: You click on it so they can see the options, please, on those, please?
**Ctragesser**: Exactly.
**Ctragesser**: So, Glenn, to your question.
**Ctragesser**: So yes, you have to mess only with the coded part.
**Ctragesser**: That's it.
**Ctragesser**: And then if that's what's coded, it will be send it to Brandon and then he will change it to approved.
**Fred**: To approved.
**Ctragesser**: Yeah, I think accounting can do it.
**Fred**: Yeah, he changes it to approved.
**Fred**: No, we don't do it because I want him to review the code and make sure that it's right.
**Fred**: So I don't touch it until he changes it from.
**Fred**: From coded to approved.
**Fred**: Then we import.
**Fred**: And then I will, at that point I will change it to upload it into Acumatica.
**Fred**: So we don't duplicate anything.
**Acannon**: Okay, so Candon, when you log in, do you only see yours or do you see everybody's like, what she has up on the screen?
**Crusin**: Okay, so there's a couple ways you can do this.
**Crusin**: All right, so up here, usually it pops up with everybody.
**Crusin**: So what I'll do is over where it says new in the blue, you can click the little magnifying glass, then I just type my name in and then that will give me my full list.
**Crusin**: So I don't know if you want to do that.
**Crusin**: If you want to go over to that magnifying glass next to new to the left.
**Crusin**: Yep.
**Crusin**: And if you want to type my name in.
**Crusin**: Yep.
**Crusin**: And then it'll show up with all of my cards or receipts.
**Fred**: All your receipts, yeah.
**Ctragesser**: Yes, you can do that or you can filter it too.
**Fred**: Oh, you can filter.
**Ctragesser**: Yeah, Correct.
**Ctragesser**: So if you want to show them how to filter it too.
**Ctragesser**: Correct.
**Ctragesser**: By the employee name.
**Ctragesser**: And then you can select, for example, Nick or whatever.
**Ctragesser**: Camden.
**Ctragesser**: Exactly.
**Ctragesser**: So you click on it once.
**Ctragesser**: Filter, you can see everything.
**Fred**: Yeah, I think the filter stays unless you change it.
**Fred**: So that may be the best option where you filter by your name and you don't have to mess with it.
**Ctragesser**: Yes.
**Ctragesser**: Or you just make sure to delete the filter.
**Ctragesser**: Just click on the X at the top.
**Ctragesser**: So there you go.
**Ctragesser**: So everybody can see it.
**Fred**: Oh, you're still seeing.
**Ctragesser**: Can do something.
**Fred**: Yeah, so.
**Fred**: Yeah, so.
**Fred**: So clicking the X does not delete the filter.
**Fred**: Filter, you have to.
**Ctragesser**: No, just click on it.
**Fred**: Yes, delete.
**Ctragesser**: That's the one.
**Ctragesser**: Correct.
**Fred**: Click on this X.
**Fred**: Yeah.
**Fred**: So you have all of these that say coded now, they should be in Brandon's court.
**Fred**: So he.
**Fred**: Once he approves them, then you'll see it because it's still under your name, but it'll say approve now.
**Fred**: Yeah.
**Fred**: And I think in the filter you can also add.
**Fred**: And you can add multiple filters.
**Fred**: You can filter, you know, by status also.
**Fred**: Yeah.
**Fred**: So it looks like you've coded all your transactions, but if I wanted to see who has not coded theirs, I'll just go in and then this is everybody that has stuff is imported status.
**Crusin**: Now, one, One other thing that me and Nick kind of figured out is if you go.
**Crusin**: If you scroll over to cost code or code plus name, I think it is.
**Crusin**: Yeah, code plus name.
**Crusin**: So Nick kind of explained to me now when we go ahead and do a contract, there's certain stuff monies in different line items.
**Crusin**: So you want to make sure you're coding to something that has money in the, I guess, account.
**Crusin**: Correct, Nick.
**Fnjie**: Or it should be to a line item that's on the job budget right.
**Crusin**: Now that that might be something more for like the PMs to go back and make sure it's allotted to something that has money in it or that's something that superintendents can get the hang of and just do you know.
**Fred**: Okay, so we have.
**Fred**: Who are the superintendents with the credit cards?
**Crusin**: It would be me, Alex, Chad.
**Crusin**: I don't know who else would have one.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Fred**: See, so you have to see if it has money.
**Crusin**: Yeah.
**Fred**: And it doesn't tell you that here, right?
**Crusin**: It doesn't, no, no.
**Fred**: Okay.
**Crusin**: So that's something like the superintendent before the job, they should know what line item we're going to be working off of.
**Crusin**: Let's say structural, concrete or structural.
**Crusin**: So anything that has to do with structural that you bought, you just want to make sure you put it underneath that cost code and name.
**Njepson**: And if I can interrupt here for just a second.
**Njepson**: So like the project manager is the one that's really ultimately managing the budget of a job.
**Njepson**: So if you're a superintendent on a job and you have to buy something that needs to communicate with your project manager, ask him where you want to code that to, and then that should all be worked out.
**Njepson**: You guys shouldn't be, you know, the PM does the buyout, knows what cost code supposed to cover what.
**Njepson**: So just let them know and they can make sure you code it correctly.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Fred**: And for the PMs that are on the call, if you see a transaction hit the wrong code in acumatica, please just reach out to me and let me know.
**Fred**: You know, there are a lot of transactions that come through here.
**Fred**: Something may have been accidentally coded to the wrong thing and then missed.
**Fred**: But if you see anything hitting the wrong code, just let me know.
**Fred**: We can fix that.
**Njepson**: Does this.
**Njepson**: If someone enters a code that's either not part of that job budget or that's be the only time does it, Adam, does it create a cost on the budget to that new code or will it not allow it to go through?
**Fred**: I haven't experienced that yet.
**Fred**: I'm not sure.
**Fred**: But what I'm thinking is if it's not on that job, it will.
**Fred**: It will give us an error in acumatica if the cost is not on the budget.
**Accounting**: Fatima, when you did that to my job, the Westville Collective, you guys had started putting some invoices from like the architect and the design team on there and you, you put them in under a code that you guys had created Member and I had to.
**Accounting**: You guys put in five different ones.
**Accounting**: I had to have you go pull them all out and put them back into one of the.
**Accounting**: A different Costco.
**Accounting**: So I think you guys were able to to add Costco.
**Accounting**: It's by just.
**Accounting**: But by By.
**Accounting**: By coding it that way.
**Accounting**: And then it showed up in our budget on Job Planner, and that's how we had to go back.
**Fred**: That code wasn't already available.
**Accounting**: No.
**Allcompany**: So on our end on Job Planner.
**Accounting**: When we open it, it'll say budgeted or non budgeted.
**Accounting**: So if it's non budgeted and you put something in there, it would.
**Accounting**: It would add that code to the budget instead of putting in one that's already allocated.
**Accounting**: So that's why I had requested anything that hits my job, just to send it to me for coding.
**Fred**: To send it to you.
**Allcompany**: Okay.
**Allcompany**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: I mean, credit cards, obviously, but any invoices.
**Accounting**: But I was curious if, say, like I have a tree company going out tomorrow, if I gave them the PO of 24 115, which is Westfield Collective, and then told them to send it to that PO and then gave them the cost code and they build it to you that way, would you know how to code it then?
**Accounting**: Would that be easier for you just to have.
**Accounting**: Just have the invoice come in, you know, 24 115.
**Fred**: A lot of the time they.
**Fred**: They don't do what you tell them to do.
**Fred**: So I think we'll.
**Fred**: It'll still be good for us to, you know, verify it with you first.
**Njepson**: Oh, the other thing.
**Njepson**: When you get an invoice, any invoices that come to accounting, they should be sent to the PM to code and approve them prior to charging them to the job.
**Njepson**: If that's not happening, then that should.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Allcompany**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Fred**: All right.
**Fred**: I.
**Fred**: I think Maria is starting to put the invoices in notion for approval.
**Fred**: Right?
**Fred**: No, the invoice for approval, the accounts payable invoices.
**Ctragesser**: Oh, so yeah, so that's already a notion.
**Ctragesser**: Everything is already depending.
**Ctragesser**: Once you're talking about.
**Fred**: Yes, yes.
**Fred**: So.
**Ctragesser**: So if you go to account.
**Ctragesser**: Yeah, so if you go to the accounting section, that should be depending invoices there already.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Fred**: So now all the invoices will be put in notion.
**Ctragesser**: Yeah.
**Ctragesser**: So pending invoices.
**Ctragesser**: There you go.
**Ctragesser**: So everything is.
**Ctragesser**: And now I added the status as pending overdue, and then I think it was completed.
**Ctragesser**: And also a reminder for to accounting when this is.
**Ctragesser**: We need to pay them.
**Njepson**: Is this assigned to.
**Ctragesser**: A person is assigned to.
**Ctragesser**: Yes to accounting.
**Njepson**: Like who's the pm?
**Njepson**: Can you add that in there?
**Ctragesser**: I.
**Ctragesser**: We don't.
**Ctragesser**: Can you scroll a little bit to your right, Fatima, please?
**Ctragesser**: I think we have the space for the pm, but I don't know.
**Ctragesser**: Yeah, there you go.
**Ctragesser**: So product managers is there.
**Ctragesser**: But now I realize so instead of having the text, we need to create the.
**Ctragesser**: Because this is added as a text, we need to add it as an assignee person.
**Ctragesser**: As a person that you can click.
**Ctragesser**: So I'll change this.
**Ctragesser**: This is a pretty simple.
**Fred**: I think it should be assigned to the PM and not accounting, because the PM will provide the coding and once it's done, accounting will.
**Fred**: Will export.
**Ctragesser**: So let me change it right now.
**Ctragesser**: We'll change it right now so we can have this ready.
**Ctragesser**: So not to you.
**Ctragesser**: So you want me to delete the.
**Ctragesser**: Your column or.
**Fred**: Yes, it needs to go to the.
**Fred**: The PM so they can code it.
**Fred**: And then once it's done, we will export like we do the credit cards.
**Fred**: So if it's assigned.
**Fred**: If it's assigned to the pm, you guys will get a notification just like you do for the credit cards.
**Fred**: Every time you have an invoice in there that needs your code in, you'll get a notification.
**Ctragesser**: I just change it so you can see that people will receive notification based on the text.
**Ctragesser**: You know, the selection of the pm.
**Fred**: Yeah.
**Fred**: And if.
**Fred**: For these.
**Fred**: If there's a job.
**Fred**: Job number.
**Fred**: Maria, you can just assign it to the PM on the job.
**Fred**: If there's no job number, then maybe we need to send it to Brandon or Jesse and maybe they can help identify the invoice.
**Ctragesser**: Okay.
**Njepson**: When a sub or a vendor sends you an invoice and it doesn't clearly mark which job it is, it would be helpful if you sent that right back to them and said you need to include the job number.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Njepson**: On this invoice.
**Njepson**: Because, like, some of them provide materials and whatnot to multiple jobs and then.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Njepson**: It's.
**Njepson**: It's a nightmare to figure it out later on.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Fred**: Percy, it looks like you were going to say something about the coding earlier.
**Fred**: Did you have anything to add?
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Gducharme**: As what they have mentioned, I think you mentioned that we cannot.
**Gducharme**: We cannot enter if it's not in the budget.
**Gducharme**: I think we can.
**Fred**: And then it will show it.
**Gducharme**: It will usually show us a negative.
**Gducharme**: That's why they were asking why we're entering that particular amount wherein there is no budget.
**Fred**: Okay, so it does show you a negative in Akumatica.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Gducharme**: In when we are going to construction.
**Gducharme**: In the project.
**Fred**: In the project.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Fred**: Yeah.
**Fred**: So whenever we have that, let's.
**Fred**: Let's look at it and maybe we can circle back with the PM to see where it needs to go and we can fix it on the front end.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Fred**: Okay.
**Fred**: Any other questions?
**Allcompany**: I guess you said it takes About a week to show up.
**Allcompany**: I have credit card transactions from two weeks ago that I still haven't seen.
**Allcompany**: Scene come through.
**Fred**: And who was that?
**Allcompany**: This is Glenn.
**Allcompany**: It should be on job.
**Allcompany**: Western Collective, 24, 115.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Crusin**: I've also got.
**Acannon**: Same thing.
**Crusin**: Same with me as well.
**Fred**: Camden from two weeks ago.
**Fnjie**: And Alex.
**Fnjie**: And Alex.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Fred**: The last import date.
**Fred**: Okay, it looks like the last import date was the 28th.
**Fred**: Okay.
**Fred**: We might have to go in and do a manual import.
**Crusin**: Yeah, I have about.
**Crusin**: I think I have about 10 receipts ready to go that I haven't come through for this month.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Fred**: All right, we'll go in and pull those in manually and I'll also review the frequency of the import and make sure that it's going to pull maybe on a weekly basis.
**Fred**: Would that work for you guys?
**Crusin**: Yes, please.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Fred**: Glenn.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Fred**: Do you know when the first day, when the date, what you date of your first transaction is, Glenn?
**Allcompany**: When I look at the calendar, it was two Thursdays ago.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Allcompany**: It would have been one.
**Allcompany**: I know I had one on the 13th.
**Fred**: Okay.
**Allcompany**: Another one on the 12th or 13th.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Fred**: Of March, right?
**Accounting**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Fred**: It looks like it is pulling through the end of.
**Fred**: Well, I see some March transactions here for the first week.
**Accounting**: No, I'm sorry.
**Allcompany**: February.
**Allcompany**: February 13th.
**Fred**: Oh, February 13th.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Crusin**: No.
**Acannon**: Lynn, we didn't even have.
**Acannon**: You didn't even have a credit card then?
**Allcompany**: Nope, you're right.
**Allcompany**: It was March.
**Allcompany**: It was March 13th.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Allcompany**: I started February 13th.
**Fred**: Filter again.
**Fred**: Yeah.
**Fred**: So I think yours may be in the March transactions.
**Fred**: Looks like the latest is March 3rd.
**Fred**: So we'll go in and pull those.
**Fred**: Pull those to date and then yours will probably populate at that point.
**Crusin**: Yeah, I know.
**Crusin**: Brandon asked us to have everything up to date by Wednesday.
**Crusin**: So are we tying these March receipts into this by Wednesday completion or is it just up to.
**Fred**: Since we don't have any March transactions pulling in, just make sure you do everything by end of.
**Fred**: Of like February.
**Fred**: Everything through end of February by Wednesday.
**Fred**: And once we load those in, you know, we'll let everybody know that those are in there.
**Fred**: Yeah.
**Fred**: Any.
**Fred**: Anything else?
**Fred**: Any other questions?
**Allcompany**: I'm good.
**Ctragesser**: Okay, guys, so now you know, I'm all set.
**Ctragesser**: Go ahead.
**Ctragesser**: Take your time, please, to do this.
**Ctragesser**: It's important.
**Ctragesser**: So take your time.
**Ctragesser**: At the end of the day or whenever you have some time, make sure you have this everything coded.
**Ctragesser**: If not, if you have still questions, don't forget to.
**Ctragesser**: Don't hesitate to text me or Fatima.
**Ctragesser**: Okay?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Ctragesser**: I'm going to do homework, guys.
**Ctragesser**: Thank you.
**Fred**: And.
**Fred**: And I am.
**Fred**: I am on you guys teams.
**Fred**: So you can always reach me on teams.
**Fred**: That.
**Fred**: That may be easier.
**Fred**: You might get a faster response that way.
**Ctragesser**: Yes.
**Fred**: Yeah.
**Fred**: All right.
**Fred**: Thank you.
**Ctragesser**: Thank you, guys.
**Ctragesser**: Thank you, Fatima.
**Fred**: All right.
**Fred**: Have a good one.
**Njepson**: Another job for that collected project in.
**Njepson**: I got to join here for a second.
**Njepson**: Work away.
**Njepson**: This thing's fancy.
**Njepson**: It's got power outlet.
**Crusin**: With the book bag?
**Njepson**: No, in the TR.
**Allcompany**: Truck.
