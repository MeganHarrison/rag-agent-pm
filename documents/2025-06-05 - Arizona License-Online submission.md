**Jdawson**: It's okay.
**Jdawson**: It's okay.
**Jdawson**: Don't worry.
**Jdawson**: We can obviously get back to this, but it's fine.
**Speaker 1**: So I think you can file as long as you got a number there maybe.
**Speaker 1**: Or.
**Jdawson**: Okay, I don't know.
**Jdawson**: So, and then we have this.
**Jdawson**: Choose your classification.
**Jdawson**: We already have it.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Which is llc.
**Jdawson**: You already have your geometrics and psi.
**Jdawson**: That's good.
**Jdawson**: Background check.
**Speaker 1**: Can you show me the classification requirements?
**Speaker 1**: Like where is that information?
**Jdawson**: We just need to select which is ours.
**Jdawson**: So, for example here, General Engineer.
**Jdawson**: What type of exams do we need?
**Jdawson**: The minimum.
**Jdawson**: Minimum years of experience.
**Jdawson**: So ours is.
**Speaker 1**: But we filled this all out correct somewhere.
**Speaker 1**: Like, where's the application?
**Jdawson**: I don't see it too.
**Jdawson**: So it's online.
**Jdawson**: So I think we just need to, for example, set B1 or B2.
**Speaker 1**: Have we started it online and filled out what we could.
**Speaker 1**: Or you're going to go in and do it.
**Jdawson**: I mean, let's check it out.
**Jdawson**: I think we can do it with yours.
**Jdawson**: Right, with your.
**Speaker 1**: Because this is just the E Corp.
**Jdawson**: Log into the RLC customer portal and then it says.
**Jdawson**: Do we have one already?
**Jdawson**: Yes, you do.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: You do.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So that's what I'm saying.
**Speaker 1**: Like what's filled out so far?
**Jdawson**: Nothing so far.
**Jdawson**: I don't think so.
**Speaker 1**: Well, that's.
**Speaker 1**: This is just for E Corp.
**Speaker 1**: So it's a different website than this other one.
**Speaker 1**: Is where.
**Jdawson**: So I don't think this is where.
**Speaker 1**: We apply for the building permit.
**Speaker 1**: So it's the same username, same password.
**Jdawson**: Should we use with yours too?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So let's do.
**Jdawson**: She goes in.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And then login.
**Jdawson**: Let's see if this.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So you are here and then it says licenses applications application type no records found.
**Jdawson**: So there has to be a way add businesses to your account.
**Jdawson**: File a complaint.
**Jdawson**: Where it says here.
**Jdawson**: So log into customer.
**Jdawson**: Don't have another or download a mailed application form.
**Jdawson**: No, just need to.
**Jdawson**: We are here in the LLC customer portal.
**Jdawson**: So that's fine.
**Jdawson**: One second.
**Jdawson**: No, we have it already here.
**Speaker 1**: I think you're already logged into that.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I don't know why but it locked me out here.
**Speaker 1**: That one right there.
**Jdawson**: So we don't need this one.
**Jdawson**: One sec.
**Jdawson**: So here we are.
**Jdawson**: How can I click application Home contractor search for.
**Speaker 1**: I think that's it won't let you do the app until that registration goes through with the corp, I believe.
**Jdawson**: Oh, you mean these ones?
**Speaker 1**: I tried that.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: This has to be approved and then you can fill out your app, I think.
**Jdawson**: Let's see what it says.
**Jdawson**: So for example, the application form is here.
**Jdawson**: Let me see something.
**Jdawson**: Is this one correct?
**Jdawson**: LLC license application form to apply for an LLC license.
**Jdawson**: So this is the one.
**Jdawson**: So here I go.
**Jdawson**: Requirements form a local and legal entity.
**Jdawson**: You have it include all person listens on the entity records and all owners of 25 more in the person sections in the license identify a qualifying party.
**Jdawson**: Each license must have a qualifying party, an owner or a regular employee with person necessary past examinations.
**Jdawson**: You have that government issue identification.
**Jdawson**: I have yours and Brandon's.
**Jdawson**: Submit background checks.
**Jdawson**: That was already submitted by you and by Brandon Bonds.
**Jdawson**: We have already signatures.
**Jdawson**: We have them fees.
**Jdawson**: Okay, that's my question.
**Jdawson**: We need to pay them.
**Jdawson**: That's okay.
**Jdawson**: Example.
**Jdawson**: So waivers and stage.
**Jdawson**: So here is applicant.
**Jdawson**: So but this is to fill out.
**Jdawson**: So this is to.
**Jdawson**: Because here it says or download and mail the application form.
**Jdawson**: I mean we can use the application for and mail it but I think it'll take more time, you know.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So if you go back to the website, where's the app?
**Jdawson**: So that's what I was trying to find.
**Jdawson**: Because for example this is the form here.
**Jdawson**: But if I go to here start a new application, no record founds.
**Jdawson**: And if I want to it doesn't let me.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, because you have to put your business name where.
**Speaker 1**: Well the business entity name.
**Speaker 1**: I think that pops up when they approve the.
**Jdawson**: The association with business Entity table will show all of your associations.
**Jdawson**: To narrow down your view, click on the applicable business entity table and it will be populated associations title specific items in the my items table.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, but I don't see.
**Jdawson**: Oh, wait one second, one second.
**Jdawson**: Okay, makes sense.
**Jdawson**: Connect a business entity to your login information.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so what is your affiliation or job title with this entity?
**Jdawson**: So it'll be Brandon, correct?
**Jdawson**: Manager.
**Jdawson**: No, actually no owner.
**Jdawson**: Does your entity.
**Speaker 1**: But I don't own 25%.
**Jdawson**: So it's a member officer partner.
**Jdawson**: Does your entity have or has it already had a license with roc?
**Jdawson**: No.
**Jdawson**: Correct.
**Jdawson**: What type of entity are you adding to your account?
**Jdawson**: Llc.
**Jdawson**: Enter your Arizona corporation.
**Jdawson**: Oh, there you go.
**Jdawson**: Corporation commission file number seven.
**Speaker 1**: So is that on that other one?
**Jdawson**: It's here.
**Jdawson**: One second.
**Jdawson**: It's not here.
**Jdawson**: File number.
**Speaker 1**: That's the receipt.
**Speaker 1**: That's what I'm saying.
**Speaker 1**: We don't.
**Speaker 1**: They haven't approved it yet.
**Speaker 1**: I don't know if we'll get that number till they approve it.
**Jdawson**: Enter your Arizona corporation commission file number.
**Jdawson**: So I don't.
**Jdawson**: Let me check if Brandon received something.
**Jdawson**: One second.
**Jdawson**: Because we did it with his email.
**Jdawson**: So order confirmation.
**Jdawson**: There you go.
**Jdawson**: Oh no, but this is.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: 35 order number.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, but nothing.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, so we don't have the number yet.
**Jdawson**: And then when it says check Arizona's feeling, then it will pop up to this application and then we can continue to fill in out.
**Jdawson**: Let me check something here.
**Jdawson**: You said my personal feelings.
**Jdawson**: Oh, approve.
**Jdawson**: One second.
**Jdawson**: Now, did you receive anything, Jesse, to your email?
**Jdawson**: Oh, well, I have your email here, but it says approve.
**Jdawson**: But I don't know if you received anything.
**Jdawson**: What says the filling here?
**Jdawson**: A little C.
**Jdawson**: Expedite.
**Jdawson**: Pending.
**Jdawson**: Request approved.
**Jdawson**: Pending.
**Jdawson**: We need to wait.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, the expedite was.
**Speaker 1**: Was approved but the registration still pending.
**Jdawson**: Okay, makes sense.
**Jdawson**: So one, we have the number.
**Jdawson**: So we'll fill it out here and then we will check and then it will probably pop up to the main entity here.
**Speaker 1**: Do it right there.
**Speaker 1**: I guess you need a number.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, I'm sorry, I thought I could.
**Speaker 1**: You could put in like Alido, but you can't.
**Speaker 1**: You need their number.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, because if I pop here again, it says everything.
**Jdawson**: Let's see.
**Jdawson**: Oh, and then LLC as an example.
**Jdawson**: And then file number.
**Jdawson**: We need a number.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, no.
**Jdawson**: So it says three to five days.
**Jdawson**: So I think we will be able to do this on Monday.
**Speaker 1**: Possibly.
**Speaker 1**: They usually it's business days.
**Speaker 1**: So we'll see.
**Jdawson**: Let's see.
**Jdawson**: I'll check it.
**Jdawson**: I'll check this tomorrow with your login.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And then I know now the everything.
**Jdawson**: So I'll make sure to have that.
**Jdawson**: And then we can continue filling this out in case we need anything.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So now we know that we have that, and we need to go back to that.
**Jdawson**: And then I just want to make sure.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, no, we have everything.
**Jdawson**: Everything is ready.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Once we have that, and once I have a file number, I'll fill it out, and if anything, I'll let you know.
