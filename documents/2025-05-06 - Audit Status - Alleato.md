## Transcript
**Bclymer**: Hey, guys.
**Fnjie**: Hi, Maria.
**Justin**: Fatima, Justin.
**Justin**: How goes it?
**Asupit**: Hey, how you doing, buddy?
**Justin**: Oh, living the dream.
**Kjin**: Sorry, I was muted.
**Kjin**: How are you?
**Fnjie**: Good, good, good.
**Fnjie**: Right, let's get started.
**Fnjie**: Kevin, let's start from the top.
**Asupit**: Yes.
**Asupit**: Let me share my screen.
**Fnjie**: I should say let's start with the most important stuff, which is we got confirmations out.
**Fnjie**: Brandon, as we discussed this morning, I'll be sending out a follow up with the percentages.
**Fnjie**: We'll be doing that shortly.
**Fnjie**: As far as our cost samples, Kevin, let's start there.
**Fnjie**: So it seems like we still have Excel spreadsheets for some of our samples rather than POs or invoices.
**Fnjie**: Fatima, do you have an update on that?
**Kjin**: I was supposed to go back and delete some of those and I just, I haven't had a chance to do that yet.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Kjin**: Yeah, so those I explained to.
**Kjin**: I was telling Kevin last night.
**Kjin**: So when we initially.
**Kjin**: When I initially did the accrual for all the costs that appeared in.
**Kjin**: In 2023, I must have been using the wrong report because I went back and I looked at another report and they weren't there.
**Kjin**: Which means that they were 2024 costs.
**Kjin**: So I went back and I backed those out.
**Kjin**: I deleted the accrual.
**Kjin**: So the 1.1 million over billing in 2023 went down to about 700,000.
**Kjin**: So a lot of those selections will be invalid now.
**Kjin**: So I just have to go back and note that now.
**Asupit**: Actually we already.
**Asupit**: We cross the check.
**Asupit**: We cross checked those, our selections.
**Asupit**: 100 selections we made, those are still valid.
**Fnjie**: She's talking about the 23 asset, Kevin.
**Fnjie**: The 23 asset.
**Kjin**: So.
**Kjin**: So a lot of the ones you selected, Kevin.
**Kjin**: Yeah, we're reversing 2023 accrual in 2024.
**Asupit**: And then we book it to the 2024 cost.
**Bclymer**: Yes, yes.
**Asupit**: So those are all the job costs.
**Asupit**: Selections for 2024 costs only.
**Asupit**: So we didn't select any of the costs that was related in the 2023.
**Kjin**: I believe some of those.
**Kjin**: So they will appear, they will appear as 2024 cost because we credited it in 23 and added the cost in 24.
**Kjin**: So they will appear as 24 costs.
**Kjin**: But when I back out the accrual, that means that we will reverse the cost in 2024 as well.
**Kjin**: Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
**Kjin**: But I'll go through the list and I'll give you.
**Kjin**: I'll add my notes in there.
**Asupit**: Yeah, so because our selected amounts, those are our.
**Asupit**: This is the amount for each samples we selected for 2024.
**Asupit**: Cost.
**Asupit**: Those are all part of our cost populations for 2024.
**Fnjie**: Okay, Kevin, you're saying our 2024 samples are.
**Fnjie**: And our cost is good?
**Asupit**: Yes.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Justin**: All right.
**Fnjie**: And so for fatima, from a 23 reclass perspective, like, you'll see number two for 158.
**Fnjie**: So just so I'm clear, that is a cost in 24.
**Fnjie**: Is that valid or no?
**Kjin**: Number two, let me look at it.
**Asupit**: So this is the.
**Fnjie**: Oh, sorry.
**Kjin**: That is invalid now because that was reversed.
**Kjin**: So if you look at the updated cost sheet I sent you.
**Asupit**: Yep.
**Kjin**: Kevin, that will not be in there.
**Fnjie**: Cost sheet meaning what.
**Fnjie**: What is the cost sheet?
**Kjin**: When I.
**Kjin**: The 2024 job loss detail.
**Justin**: Oh.
**Fnjie**: Oh, so 2024 cost has changed, you're saying?
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Fnjie**: Oh.
**Kjin**: But I can identify what.
**Kjin**: What.
**Kjin**: What changed.
**Kjin**: It's just these 2023 accruals that got reversed.
**Kjin**: Those are the only things that changed.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Maybe.
**Kjin**: Maybe we should meet after this, Kevin, and just go through each.
**Kjin**: Each one.
**Kjin**: I think it'll make more sense to you when I show you what I'm talking about.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Asupit**: So, Fatima, just one question.
**Asupit**: So it will.
**Asupit**: Will they change our trial balance accounts?
**Asupit**: Trial balance?
**Kjin**: The trial balance did change a little bit, yes.
**Asupit**: Okay, let me pull out this.
**Asupit**: Fatima, I guess.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Justin**: For.
**Fnjie**: For the purposes of this call, Fatima and Kevin and myself.
**Fnjie**: Let's.
**Justin**: Let's.
**Fnjie**: Let's stay on afterwards.
**Fnjie**: For the purposes of this call, are there any invoices or pos that we don't have that we need Brandon to get on top of?
**Asupit**: Yeah, so we.
**Asupit**: We need to send that confirmation.
**Asupit**: Ar.
**Asupit**: Confirmation for 2022 as well.
**Fnjie**: For cost selections first, Kevin.
**Fnjie**: For cost selections.
**Fnjie**: For invoices that we don't have.
**Fnjie**: For pos.
**Fnjie**: That we don't have.
**Fnjie**: Which ones do we need Brandon to.
**Fnjie**: To fetch for us?
**Fnjie**: Or do we send them a list and say these are the ones we're missing?
**Asupit**: No, for the cost sections, we haven't yet.
**Fnjie**: So go to.
**Fnjie**: Go to selection 77 that I was looking at earlier with you.
**Fnjie**: Yeah, selection 77.
**Fnjie**: We don't have.
**Fnjie**: We don't have.
**Asupit**: This is the expression.
**Fnjie**: Evan.
**Fnjie**: Oh, this is the spreadsheet that she gave us.
**Asupit**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Fnjie**: Oh, oh, oh.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: What's the amount here?
**Fnjie**: What's the number?
**Asupit**: 106K.
**Asupit**: Yeah.
**Asupit**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: Go back to the spreadsheet.
**Fnjie**: So that's.
**Fnjie**: So this is what.
**Fnjie**: This is where you have the lump sum, right, Fatima?
**Fnjie**: A lump sum of different invoices.
**Fnjie**: Okay, so where's the 106 here?
**Fnjie**: Where's the detail of that if you.
**Fnjie**: Oh, everything in purple.
**Kjin**: Okay, Everything in purple.
**Kjin**: So if you double click each one, you'll see the invoice list.
**Fnjie**: Okay, so double click the 45,000.
**Fnjie**: Kevin.
**Asupit**: Yeah.
**Fnjie**: Okay, so let's just pick the biggest one.
**Fnjie**: Let's just take the Hilton West Palm beach for $2,600.
**Fnjie**: Okay, this is what, this is the selection we're going to need, right, to satisfy this one, right?
**Asupit**: Yeah.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: Now do we have the invoice for this one or do we need Brandon to get it to us?
**Mcalcetero**: That's a credit card transaction.
**Fnjie**: That's fine.
**Fnjie**: We'll get the credit card.
**Fnjie**: But is there an invoice related to that payment that you got at the hotel that you guys retained?
**Mcalcetero**: I mean, I can go back to and look through my emails to find, you know, whatever a thing from Hilton like.
**Fnjie**: Okay, if it takes you a couple seconds, great.
**Fnjie**: If not, we'll rely on the bank statement or, sorry, the credit card statement.
**Fnjie**: But you'll need to help us when we get you exactly what we need.
**Fnjie**: This is a good example where you'll let us know which job this was related to.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah.
**Mcalcetero**: So that 23, 112.
**Mcalcetero**: I mean, that's the job code right there.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: Even better.
**Fnjie**: Okay, excellent.
**Mcalcetero**: So do you do, like.
**Mcalcetero**: So do you still need.
**Mcalcetero**: Because I, I can tell you right now, I definitely do not have those receipts from whenever, you know.
**Fnjie**: No, for now, as long as we see it on the credit card statement, we're fine.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: So, Kevin.
**Fnjie**: Yeah.
**Fnjie**: We need to, we need to.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: After all these numbers have, have changed, we need to get to the bottom of this.
**Asupit**: Got it.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Asupit**: Yeah.
**Fnjie**: And we need to, we need to let them know what we need.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Asupit**: So we only need one samples from each spreadsheet.
**Fnjie**: That's right.
**Fnjie**: That's right.
**Asupit**: Yep, we can do that.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Mcalcetero**: So right now there's.
**Mcalcetero**: You don't need any invoices from me.
**Fnjie**: Yeah, for now we're gonna, we're gonna look at what we have that we didn't get an invoice for?
**Fnjie**: If we go to the credit card statement in that example, and we're fine, and we see the job code, which we fine with in that example.
**Fnjie**: If everything works out just like we just did, then.
**Fnjie**: No, we don't need anything.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: Next.
**Fnjie**: Kevin.
**Asupit**: Brandon, we still need to send the 2023 AR confirmation letter which was included in the email that I sent last night.
**Asupit**: But I can separate.
**Fnjie**: Send Brandon an email.
**Asupit**: Yes.
**Fnjie**: Specifically with those two confirmations.
**Asupit**: Yeah.
**Fnjie**: Separate one.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: And tell them to send Cart and Zion.
**Fnjie**: These two specifically to those two customers.
**Asupit**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: Yeah, well, you'll get that right after this call.
**Fnjie**: Brandon next.
**Asupit**: Yes.
**Asupit**: And then I'm still in the middle of checking those confirmation letters that we already sent.
**Asupit**: And then the ones that we already received.
**Asupit**: I will let you know, Brandon and Maria, after this call.
**Asupit**: And so this.
**Asupit**: I guess this is the question for the.
**Asupit**: To the.
**Asupit**: Fatima, looks like we have Additional Ars in 2023 besides the ones we cover in the confirmation letter, which is GL Detail 1110.
**Asupit**: We have 433,000 in 2023.
**Kjin**: 1110.
**Kjin**: What's the name of that account?
**Asupit**: Accounts.
**Kjin**: Yes.
**Kjin**: So those are.
**Kjin**: Those are billed.
**Kjin**: So those were for projects that ended in 2023, but were built in 2024.
**Kjin**: So that's just an accrual that got backed out.
**Kjin**: It would get backed out in 2025.
**Kjin**: So we can't really confirm those amounts because they didn't receive the invoices.
**Kjin**: They received the invoices after they received the AR billings in 2025.
**Fnjie**: Now this is the AR in 23.
**Kjin**: This is 23.
**Asupit**: Yeah.
**Fnjie**: At the battle, we didn't have.
**Fnjie**: We didn't have this balance on a pre.
**Fnjie**: So this is new.
**Fnjie**: We didn't see this before.
**Kjin**: Okay, let me double check.
**Mcalcetero**: Is that like one transaction?
**Mcalcetero**: Is it multiple?
**Mcalcetero**: Like, where does that feed from?
**Asupit**: Like.
**Mcalcetero**: Like, how did that 433327 populate from invoices.
**Mcalcetero**: So multiple transactions.
**Fnjie**: That's.
**Fnjie**: Yes, that's what Fatima is saying.
**Fnjie**: Fatima can show the detail.
**Kjin**: I'll get the backup for that 433, which is seven.
**Kjin**: That is built.
**Kjin**: Okay, so can you share your screen.
**Fnjie**: And show us the detail.
**Kjin**: In the notes here?
**Kjin**: I have that.
**Kjin**: It was to correct the revenue 2024.
**Kjin**: Revenue that was accrued in 2023.
**Kjin**: Because we had some jobs that had revenue in 2024, but we said they were.
**Kjin**: They ended in 23.
**Kjin**: Let me see if I can find it back on.
**Fnjie**: So These are all 23 job codes.
**Fnjie**: They ended in 23, correct?
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Fnjie**: Jobs were done by the end.
**Fnjie**: By the end of 2023, correct?
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Fnjie**: Okay, and so this number.
**Fnjie**: It's a specific number.
**Fnjie**: Had to come from somewhere.
**Fnjie**: Do you know what's behind this number?
**Kjin**: Yeah, that's.
**Kjin**: That's what I'm pulling up.
**Kjin**: It's day three from siva, Memphis Radio, and car.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: So those are multiple invoices that make up those three.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Fnjie**: Okay, so.
**Kjin**: So they had revenue in 2024, but then we confirmed that they ended in 2023.
**Kjin**: They were just built in 2024.
**Fnjie**: Yep.
**Justin**: And.
**Fnjie**: And that's.
**Fnjie**: And that's correct.
**Fnjie**: So now.
**Fnjie**: So now we need to look at maybe one or two of those invoices.
**Fnjie**: So let's say, for example, Radial Avion 232,000.
**Fnjie**: What's the invoice detail behind that?
**Fnjie**: Since they were already billed?
**Kjin**: 232, 758.
**Kjin**: This invoice.
**Fnjie**: Looks like it was a debit and a credit.
**Fnjie**: Yeah.
**Kjin**: Here's the actual invoice right here.
**Kjin**: The last one.
**Fnjie**: Yep.
**Fnjie**: Can we see that, please?
**Kjin**: So usually we just go.
**Kjin**: Go in here and we print.
**Kjin**: This will be the invoice that goes out to the client.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: All right, so this is fine.
**Fnjie**: So let's.
**Fnjie**: Let's go with this and show us when it was paid in 24.
**Fnjie**: And then we'll be off to the races.
**Fnjie**: That's all we need for this one.
**Fnjie**: So when was this.
**Fnjie**: When was this paid?
**Bclymer**: Let's see.
**Kjin**: I gotta figure out how to get to the payments.
**Fnjie**: You want.
**Mcalcetero**: You want to know when that was paid?
**Kjin**: When that invoice was paid?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay.
**Mcalcetero**: What's the invoice number?
**Justin**: I got it right there.
**Mcalcetero**: 0174.
**Mcalcetero**: For 232757.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Kjin**: 8.
**Fnjie**: So, MGO, take this and reclass it from AR to AR jobs or whatever the other one was.
**Fnjie**: It doesn't affect anything.
**Fnjie**: It's just a reclass on the balance sheet.
**Kjin**: We can't reclass.
**Kjin**: So when you for.
**Kjin**: On the AR jobs, you have to actually enter an invoice in order to hit AR jobs.
**Kjin**: It has to go through AR.
**Mcalcetero**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Fnjie**: But for 23, the invoice didn't.
**Fnjie**: Didn't exist back then.
**Justin**: Right.
**Mcalcetero**: It got paid on March 8, 2024.
**Fnjie**: March 8, 2024.
**Fnjie**: MGO, do we have the bank.
**Fnjie**: We have the bank statements, right.
**Justin**: Kevin, you're muted.
**Asupit**: Yes, we do.
**Justin**: Okay, so go to March 8, 2024.
**Justin**: And that's the supporter.
**Fnjie**: And we're done.
**Justin**: So, Fatima, So it was billed in 24, as we saw.
**Fnjie**: But it was earned.
**Justin**: It was earned.
**Fnjie**: It was an earned receivable in 23.
**Kjin**: In 23?
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Justin**: Okay, so wouldn't that tell me it's an underbilling cost, an excess of billings.
**Kjin**: Yeah, that's.
**Kjin**: That was the other side of the entry.
**Kjin**: Well, costing excess of billing.
**Kjin**: Where did it go?
**Kjin**: Yeah, it would have been an under billing in 23.
**Fnjie**: Yep.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Justin**: Okay, we got.
**Fnjie**: We got it.
**Justin**: Thank you.
**Justin**: Okay, so this is.
**Justin**: This is exactly what we need to do to knock these things out as soon, like in real time.
**Justin**: So whatever we need to do to get on calls to go through it one by one, let's do that in order to minimize the back and forth at this time.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Justin**: So Fatima, you can feel free to.
**Justin**: If you have time.
**Justin**: Right after this, we can go through them one by one.
**Fnjie**: Okay, excellent.
**Justin**: Anything else we need from Brandon or Maria or anybody else, Kevin?
**Asupit**: Not from.
**Asupit**: Not from my end.
**Asupit**: But I will have one question with the Fatima about the accrued GL accounts as well.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Asupit**: Which is Fatima, GL accounts.
**Asupit**: 2025 M.
**Asupit**: And there was a 178,000 balance in 2023.
**Kjin**: 125.
**Asupit**: Do we want to let Brandon and Maria go?
**Asupit**: Sorry, Brandon, one quick questions.
**Asupit**: Dude.
**Asupit**: So, yeah, so there was a salary decreased in 2020.
**Justin**: Brandon's not going to know the answer.
**Mcalcetero**: To that question because it's salary decreased in 2020.
**Mcalcetero**: We didn't exist in 2020.
**Mcalcetero**: So there's the answer.
**Asupit**: No, sorry.
**Asupit**: Sorry.
**Asupit**: 2024.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay.
**Asupit**: Yeah.
**Asupit**: So the balance was 100,000 in 2024.
**Asupit**: And then the.
**Asupit**: In 2023, the balance is 325,000.
**Justin**: And this recently changed, right, Kevin?
**Asupit**: Yes.
**Asupit**: What do you mean?
**Asupit**: Like the balance.
**Mcalcetero**: You're saying how much we paid out?
**Justin**: Yes.
**Justin**: Kevin, just show them the P.
**Justin**: L.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Asupit**: Let me share my screen.
**Bclymer**: I'm.
**Mcalcetero**: Before you even show me.
**Mcalcetero**: Let me guess.
**Mcalcetero**: In 2023 it was hitting overhead.
**Mcalcetero**: In 2024, that overhead is smaller.
**Asupit**: Okay, so this is the one.
**Justin**: When you say overhead, just to make sure we're in the same lingo, that means gna.
**Justin**: Is that what.
**Justin**: Justin, if you didn't help out, is that what's meant by overhead here?
**Asupit**: I think.
**Asupit**: I think that's what.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So when I say overhead, that's what he means.
**Mcalcetero**: That means like.
**Mcalcetero**: Like how Fatima and Maria, they charge to overhead.
**Mcalcetero**: Like my time and everybody else's time.
**Mcalcetero**: OPS goes to jobs.
**Mcalcetero**: Cost of work.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: All right.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Fnjie**: So GNA job administrator.
**Justin**: Okay, so just like.
**Justin**: So in 24, you started allocating some of those salaries to jobs, correct?
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, we just got disciplined about coding everything.
**Asupit**: Okay.
**Justin**: All right.
**Asupit**: So I'm removing this accounts to the cost labor.
**Asupit**: Fatima.
**Asupit**: What?
**Fnjie**: What?
**Justin**: Kevin, I'll explain it to you.
**Justin**: We're good.
**Asupit**: Yeah, we're good.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Asupit**: Yeah, I guess.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Justin**: Yeah, we can go back to that accrual.
**Justin**: Fatima.
**Justin**: Okay, Brandon, I think we're good.
**Justin**: Thank you so much.
**Mcalcetero**: All right.
**Mcalcetero**: Thanks, guys.
**Fnjie**: Goodbye.
**Bclymer**: You guys need me for anything?
**Kjin**: All good.
**Justin**: Oh, Maria, thank you so much.
**Justin**: No, thank you.
**Bclymer**: It's okay.
**Fnjie**: Bye, guys.
**Kjin**: Okay, so this is the accrual, the 100, the 16 and the 162.
**Kjin**: So in the selections, the first selections, you guys.
**Kjin**: Can you see my screen?
**Asupit**: Yes.
**Kjin**: So four selections you guys made.
**Kjin**: There were these two invoices that.
**Kjin**: That we discovered where belong to prior year.
**Kjin**: So one of these was actually dated January 2023.
**Fnjie**: This is.
**Fnjie**: This is a liability.
**Justin**: This is an accrual liability.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Justin**: Okay, so it probably hit an expense and is accrue in 23, right?
**Kjin**: 23, yes.
**Justin**: Okay, and these invoices are 2023 invoices.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Justin**: Okay, can you show us one of.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Justin**: Siemens 1 3, 12 3.
**Justin**: Which job is this related to?
**Kjin**: 23, 102.
**Justin**: And this was.
**Justin**: And this had.
**Justin**: Can you remind me when it started and finished?
**Kjin**: Diva, Memphis.
**Kjin**: It ended in 2023.
**Fnjie**: Okay, the same.
**Justin**: The same one.
**Justin**: So it ended in 23.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Justin**: So the cost and this accrual is in 23.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Justin**: Kevin, you see it on the TV in 23.
**Asupit**: In the WIP schedule.
**Asupit**: Forget the WIP schedule.
**Justin**: On the trial balance, is it recorded?
**Justin**: Is this 178 or 170 in 2023?
**Asupit**: 178,000.
**Asupit**: Yes.
**Asupit**: Under the accrued.
**Asupit**: Yes, I can, but I can't find that in the cost.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Asupit**: Yeah.
**Justin**: Well, the other side of it was cost, right, Fatima?
**Justin**: And 23.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Fnjie**: Hold on.
**Kjin**: There was.
**Kjin**: I made an.
**Kjin**: I made a mistake here.
**Kjin**: This was the correction.
**Kjin**: 165.
**Fnjie**: 195.
**Kjin**: Let me find the other entry.
**Justin**: The job was done.
**Justin**: It was in cost, but we didn't pay for it.
**Justin**: Hopefully we didn't pay for it until 2024.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Kjin**: Looking for.
**Kjin**: So I accidentally coded it here before.
**Asupit**: And.
**Kjin**: Yep, it went to cost in.
**Fnjie**: 2023, as it should have.
**Justin**: So.
**Justin**: Kevin, are you good?
**Asupit**: Yeah, I'm good.
**Fnjie**: Excellent.
**Justin**: What else, Kevin?
**Justin**: I think those are the major two ones.
**Fnjie**: Right.
**Asupit**: So for this, 178 should read just the documents in the leash sheet.
**Justin**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Anything else?
**Asupit**: No, but.
**Asupit**: Yeah, I want to know how do we do this?
**Asupit**: 433,000.
**Asupit**: You want me to reclass it to the.
**Justin**: I'll let you know.
**Justin**: I'll let you.
**Asupit**: Okay.
**Asupit**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Kjin**: So the 433,000, just to mention you will see the reversal in 2024, which will offset against the AR invoice.
**Asupit**: Yeah.
**Asupit**: Okay.
**Kjin**: Oh, I think some of the items.
**Kjin**: So some of the spreadsheets, as we saw earlier, will have the detail of the reclass and you have to double click in it to get the.
**Kjin**: The whole invoice detail, right?
**Asupit**: Yeah.
**Kjin**: But on these so originally these were the accruals, but we reversed everything.
**Kjin**: So I ran a different report for 2023 and it showed zero cost.
**Kjin**: So I reversed my accrual.
**Kjin**: I'm not sure what I did wrong the first time, but I reversed these.
**Asupit**: Okay.
**Kjin**: So in the end the only accrual we'll have for 2023 was this 745,000.
**Kjin**: I think we.
**Kjin**: We looked at that yesterday, Kevin.
**Kjin**: So I know that some of these, like this 158.
**Kjin**: I believe this is number two in your selections.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**Kjin**: Where you select.
**Kjin**: So now on the new trial balance that I uploaded, it's not.
**Kjin**: It won't.
**Kjin**: It will not be there because I reversed out the accrual in 2023 and reverse the cost in 24.
**Justin**: The only.
**Justin**: So the only asset is a 745.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Justin**: And that 745 is what exactly is it?
**Fnjie**: A prepaid cost.
**Asupit**: That's the one.
**Kjin**: You selected samples from there this morning.
**Kjin**: And I uploaded the invoices.
**Asupit**: Yeah, that's okay.
**Asupit**: That makes the net balance of 730,000 of the under bidding.
**Asupit**: 2023.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Kjin**: And because these also.
**Kjin**: So remember these ion.
**Justin**: Well, actually on the 745, is it a prepaid or is it not a prepaid?
**Kjin**: I am waiting for the check copies from the accountant.
**Kjin**: They were billed in 24.
**Kjin**: I mean March 2023.
**Kjin**: Chances are they were paid before the end of the year.
**Justin**: March 2023.
**Bclymer**: April.
**Asupit**: They build it.
**Justin**: I'm sorry, it's.
**Justin**: It was an April invoice.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Justin**: And when was it paid?
**Kjin**: I'm still waiting for the check.
**Kjin**: The check confirmation.
**Justin**: Got it.
**Kjin**: Yeah, but Ultra Dallas, this is the job that Brandon said, you know, they front loaded the job in 23.
**Justin**: Tell in acumatica when something was paid, when an invoice was paid.
**Kjin**: I can, I can, but I just like to get the check copies confirm because sometimes they avoid and reissue a lot of things.
**Kjin**: So let me study.
**Kjin**: 60 was paid in August 2023.
**Justin**: Okay, so it's not a prepaid in 23.
**Kjin**: What do you say?
**Kjin**: It's not a prepaid.
**Justin**: No, no.
**Justin**: And as of 1231, 23 it was paid already.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Justin**: So it's not a Prepaid as of 1231 23.
**Justin**: Oh, I'm sorry.
**Justin**: Oh, I'm so sorry.
**Justin**: What?
**Justin**: It was paid in August of 23.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Justin**: Front loaded, right?
**Justin**: Oh yeah, yeah.
**Fnjie**: No, we're good, we're good.
**Justin**: I'm so sorry.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Asupit**: So once we trace the amount payment payments to the bank statements and we Are good?
**Justin**: Yes.
**Asupit**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Justin**: Will the, this was for Ulta Dallas, right?
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Kjin**: These are all for Alta Dallas?
**Asupit**: Yes.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Justin**: And Ulta Dallas is the one.
**Justin**: Go back to our revised WHIP schedule, please.
**Justin**: Ulta Dallas.
**Justin**: Did we have work on Ulta Dallas or.
**Justin**: We had minimal work.
**Kjin**: Maybe minimal work.
**Kjin**: We, we moved pretty much all the cost to 24.
**Fnjie**: Got it.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: Yes.
**Justin**: All right, so this is, I should see this for basically all of Ulta Dallas, where they paid a whole bunch of the subs or vendors or whoever in 23, but the work didn't start until 24.
**Justin**: Right?
**Fnjie**: Yeah.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Justin**: When are we going to get a revised trial balance reflecting this?
**Kjin**: It's already there.
**Bclymer**: Uploaded it yesterday.
**Justin**: Oh, so the asset, the Prepaid was only 7.45 now?
**Kjin**: Yes.
**Kjin**: The, the, the asset, the cost in excess.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Justin**: It has to be a prepaid, though.
**Kjin**: It has to be a prepaid.
**Fnjie**: Yeah, it has to be classified as.
**Justin**: A, do we have a prepaid account that we can classify it to?
**Justin**: You don't need to give us a new trial balance.
**Justin**: We'll do it internally, but.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Justin**: I mean, at the end when all is said and done, we're going to give you our trial balance to make sure it ties to yours.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Kjin**: So the net in that costing Excess account is 730.
**Kjin**: Because there were these items, these jobs that had, you know, credits minimal cost in 2024, but Brandon said they ended in 23.
**Justin**: Oh, got it.
**Fnjie**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Kjin**: So all of these, I gave the detail.
**Kjin**: These are the ones that net to the 430.
**Kjin**: The detail is there.
**Kjin**: Everything ties out.
**Asupit**: Yes.
**Justin**: We got 45 netted with these two, with these three.
**Kjin**: 745 to 7:30.
**Kjin**: I sent you the detail, Kevin.
**Kjin**: Right.
**Asupit**: Yes.
**Asupit**: Yeah, we do have that detail.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Kjin**: It's some of these that netted to the 730.
**Asupit**: Yeah.
**Kjin**: I can't remember exactly.
**Asupit**: The net balance is recorded under asset cie, under billing accounts.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Kjin**: This is the first WHIP that I edited.
**Kjin**: It's not the final.
**Kjin**: I just used it to kind of mark what?
**Justin**: Yeah, yeah, I know.
**Justin**: Yeah, I know, but I, I, I'm wondering why we.
**Justin**: So the 162 for Siva Memphis, we push that cost into 23, right?
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Justin**: But why is it an asset?
**Kjin**: I don't think that was an asset.
**Justin**: Oh, I thought we're saying it is.
**Kjin**: No, no, no.
**Kjin**: I don't think it wasn't an asset.
**Kjin**: I can find a detail and send it to you, but it wasn't, it wasn't an asset.
**Justin**: Okay, so when you Push this cost into 23.
**Justin**: You debited cost.
**Justin**: What did you credit?
**Kjin**: It's part of the number that went into the accrued.
**Kjin**: Accrued job in 23.
**Justin**: Very good.
**Fnjie**: Very, very good.
**Justin**: Excellent.
**Asupit**: Okay, Fatima, just to clarify, so from your updated WIP schedules, this, Siva, Memphis, and those, Radio Evan and Cart Hebron, those are all gone from the WIP schedule, right?
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Fnjie**: Let me pull up the updated one.
**Fnjie**: Yeah, this is the.
**Kjin**: Yeah, this is the updated schedule.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Kjin**: Goodwill Excel was in the completed section, but I moved it up because Brandon got additional work in 25.
**Kjin**: So it's gonna keep going.
**Asupit**: Hey, guys.
**Fnjie**: Sorry, I got an 1145 to jump into.
**Justin**: Thanks, Justin.
**Asupit**: Check in if you need anything from me.
**Fnjie**: See you guys.
**Kjin**: All right.
**Fnjie**: So for Goodwill Excel, the.
**Justin**: Actual job that they were doing in 24 was not complete yet, right?
**Kjin**: It was, but the owner reached out to them again for additional work.
**Justin**: Okay, but if we're.
**Justin**: If we have additional new work, and that should be a different job code.
**Justin**: Well, because right.
**Justin**: Right now it's saying 100% done.
**Justin**: But it's.
**Justin**: But it should be.
**Justin**: I mean, it really should be in the bottom.
**Kjin**: Yeah, I think they already put in stuff to it.
**Kjin**: Maybe we need to talk to Brandon about that.
**Justin**: Yeah, hold on one second.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: He texted me.
**Fnjie**: He is in a meeting.
**Kjin**: So the.
**Kjin**: The numbers on the whip won't.
**Kjin**: Won't change as of Now.
**Kjin**: As of 24, they were done with that one.
**Kjin**: So if we need to move it to the bottom, we'll just move it.
**Bclymer**: But, yeah, I get what you're saying.
**Justin**: Yeah, I think it needs to move to the bottom.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Justin**: Because again, if it's the same project that just went on into 2025, then it wouldn't be 100 done.
**Justin**: But if they had a project with the same customer and then the customer said, hey, you guys did a great job.
**Justin**: I want you to guys do this additional work, new work, then that.
**Justin**: I mean, that really should be a new job code.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Kjin**: What if the owner just did it as a change order to the current project?
**Bclymer**: What.
**Kjin**: Which I think is the case.
**Justin**: Yeah, we'll.
**Justin**: We'll have to tell Brandon that.
**Justin**: I mean, a change order is.
**Justin**: Is regarding the current order, like the current project.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Justin**: And so they'll need to change that to reflect.
**Justin**: To reflect it differently moving forward, because.
**Fnjie**: Right now it's confusing.
**Fnjie**: So Anyway, I think 20.
**Fnjie**: This goodwill excel needs to go to completed job.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Kjin**: You want me to move it and resend this or.
**Fnjie**: No, Kevin, just move it down to completed jobs.
**Asupit**: Yeah, okay, but we Just received the sign confirmation from this Google Excel.
**Bclymer**: Huh.
**Asupit**: And then he said the letter that we prepared is.
**Asupit**: Looks good.
**Fnjie**: Yes.
**Asupit**: Which means.
**Asupit**: Because here.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Fnjie**: It ties the numbers.
**Fnjie**: We're just moving it from row 12 down to completed.
**Asupit**: Oh, got it.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: It's not going to change the numbers that he can.
**Kjin**: Yeah, it's not going to change anything.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: So that's why when we follow up Kevin and send him a completion of yes.
**Fnjie**: Project, we need to say 100 complete as of 1231 24.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Asupit**: Yep.
**Fnjie**: All right.
**Justin**: All right.
**Fnjie**: Anything else?
**Asupit**: Should we go back to the job costs testings?
**Kjin**: Sure.
**Fnjie**: You guys can stay on.
**Fnjie**: I gotta go have another meeting.
**Fnjie**: But Kevin, focus on exactly what we need, please.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Asupit**: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Fnjie**: All right.
**Fnjie**: Thank you so much.
**Fnjie**: Thanks, Fatima.
**Kjin**: All right, no problem.
**Kjin**: Thank you.
**Asupit**: Hi, Fatima.
**Asupit**: So for the.
**Asupit**: Let's discuss the job job cost samples.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Asupit**: After we received the updated job costs spreadsheet which ties to our current tb, we cross checked that if our old selection is valid or invalid.
**Asupit**: Right.
**Asupit**: And then we noticed that majority of them are valid.
**Asupit**: And then.
**Asupit**: So that's why we just keep.
**Asupit**: Keep them as what it is.
**Asupit**: Yes.
**Asupit**: And then you said.
**Asupit**: Because I remember you said some of the samples are not applicable based on our updated.
**Asupit**: According to our updated web schedule.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Asupit**: Yeah.
**Asupit**: So can you just let us know which one.
**Asupit**: Can you just randomly pick one for us to check?
**Kjin**: So number two.
**Kjin**: Number two.
**Asupit**: Okay, got it.
**Asupit**: Let me open the apap.
**Kjin**: I can send you.
**Kjin**: So if you look at this sheet.
**Kjin**: Right.
**Asupit**: That.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Asupit**: What.
**Asupit**: What is the job code?
**Asupit**: That of the number 2 24, 101.
**Asupit**: Okay.
**Asupit**: 4, 1, 01.
**Asupit**: Okay, let me see.
**Asupit**: What is the sample amounts from our.
**Bclymer**: End.
**Kjin**: Sample amount is.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Asupit**: 1, 158.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Kjin**: If you look at the new.
**Kjin**: I uploaded.
**Asupit**: I got it.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Asupit**: I got what you mean.
**Asupit**: Yeah.
**Asupit**: So Jason.
**Asupit**: Okay, so here's the thing.
**Asupit**: We noted that you offset with this same balance with the credit amounts.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Asupit**: So Jason.
**Asupit**: Oh, sorry.
**Asupit**: Can I share my screen?
**Kjin**: Yeah, yeah, go ahead.
**Asupit**: Yeah.
**Asupit**: So this is the one we saw under the debit.
**Asupit**: Jason, you are muted.
**Evliao**: Sorry, I think you are in the wrong.
**Kjin**: Yeah, I think you share in the wrong.
**Asupit**: Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.
**Asupit**: Okay, so this is our sample amount.
**Asupit**: But looks like Fatima has reversed this amounts with credit.
**Asupit**: So we have to take this out.
**Asupit**: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Evliao**: I have to double check all this.
**Asupit**: Yes.
**Asupit**: Okay, Fatima, let's.
**Asupit**: I will have Jason double check our selections.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Asupit**: We're gonna take out some of the samples if this is not valid.
**Asupit**: And then we will Ping you.
**Asupit**: But in the meantime could you please go ahead and those our samples and then let us know which one we need to make a sub selection from the spreadsheet you provide which one you.
**Kjin**: Need to make sub selections from.
**Kjin**: What do you mean?
**Asupit**: Yeah, because.
**Asupit**: Yeah, because you.
**Asupit**: You provided those spreadsheet for a few of the samples, right?
**Asupit**: I guess those PDFs are so PDF supporting documents are exactly the one we need.
**Asupit**: And then we can observe the our sample amounts in the PDF file.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Asupit**: And then I guess those spread.
**Asupit**: The reason why you upload the spreadsheet is this is just lump sum.
**Kjin**: Yes.
**Kjin**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Asupit**: If that is the request like we went through already, I'm going to double click those lump sum amounts and then just to pick one sub selections for each spreadsheet.
**Bclymer**: Okay, that's fine.
**Asupit**: Yeah, so can you just let us know.
**Asupit**: Okay, let me see when you go to do.
**Asupit**: Let me find out if there is an easier way.
**Kjin**: Actually let me see what I can do since I'm in it right now like 50.
**Asupit**: Let's do this.
**Asupit**: So for this status column you can say that need stop selection, something like that.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Asupit**: Yeah.
**Asupit**: On all of those samples that you uploaded the spreadsheet.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Kjin**: So on the other ones should I just like number two, what do you want to do with those?
**Asupit**: And we're going to take this out.
**Kjin**: You're going to take those out.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Kjin**: So the other reclasses are.
**Kjin**: Okay, I'll see if I can get to it today to do all of that.
**Kjin**: I'll try to do that today, but I have other, you know, like pending client tasks that I've been putting off for.
**Kjin**: For a long time now.
**Kjin**: I need to get them done.
**Asupit**: Got it.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Kjin**: But I'll, I'll try to get that done okay for you today.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Asupit**: We try to get this simple testing done within this two days.
**Asupit**: Okay.
**Asupit**: So once we receive your updates and then we're gonna make some selections for all the.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Kjin**: Actually I'll.
**Kjin**: I'll just do it right now after this call.
**Kjin**: I just go.
**Kjin**: Go through.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Asupit**: Yes, got it, got it.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Asupit**: All right, thanks so much.
**Kjin**: No problem.
**Kjin**: Let me know if you need anything else.
**Kjin**: Okay.
**Kjin**: Oh, you have a question?
**Evliao**: Yeah, can we go back to SF SF UL number three.
**Evliao**: I just had one question related.
**Evliao**: Do that for that please see comment.
**Evliao**: So I noticed that this invoice was issued in 2023, but why did we pay until like January 2024?
**Evliao**: Is that any reason for that?
**Evliao**: Do you know?
**Kjin**: So invoice was issued in 2020, 2023.
**Kjin**: But they never received it.
**Kjin**: They never received a copy of the invoice.
**Kjin**: They were never built for it.
**Kjin**: So I'm guessing the sub reached out asking for payment in 2024.
**Kjin**: That's when the invoice was resent and paid.
**Asupit**: Oh, which means we never received the invoice.
**Asupit**: Even we.
**Evliao**: Even.
**Kjin**: So the work was done.
**Kjin**: The work was completed.
**Kjin**: They sent the invoice.
**Kjin**: Maybe somebody didn't get it, they didn't enter it.
**Kjin**: But it wasn't in the system.
**Kjin**: Yeah.
**Kjin**: So when they requested payment, then they entered it and paid it.
**Kjin**: But the work was completed in 2023.
**Asupit**: Okay, but it looks like in the updated TB we already accrue this amount into the 2023, right?
**Kjin**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Asupit**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Evliao**: So I can document it.
**Asupit**: Okay.
**Asupit**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Asupit**: I guess this, this is the only one question we have.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Asupit**: Yeah, yeah, sure.
**Asupit**: And then Al Fatima, just to please note that we also need those payments proof.
**Asupit**: We can.
**Asupit**: Which we can trace it to the bank statements.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Kjin**: Okay.
**Kjin**: Proof of payment.
**Kjin**: Okay, I'll.
**Kjin**: I'll send.
**Kjin**: I have two checks that I can provide but I'll probably just have the team go in and maybe do a screenshot of Akumatica to show a payment date.
**Asupit**: Got it.
**Kjin**: And then you can kind of look for those in the.
**Kjin**: In the bank statement.
**Bclymer**: Would that work?
**Asupit**: Yeah, so because.
**Bclymer**: Oh.
**Asupit**: Based on my experience.
**Asupit**: Right.
**Asupit**: If we request payment proof, sometimes the ones we.
**Asupit**: The supporting documents we received is just probably a lump sum amount.
**Asupit**: That deposit that withdrawn from the bank statements.
**Asupit**: If that is the.
**Asupit**: If that payments that we observe from the bank statements includes some other invoice.
**Asupit**: Right.
**Asupit**: We need that breakdown listing to see that lump sum amounts is includes over sample amounts.
**Kjin**: Let me show you for example.
**Fnjie**: Ultra dollars.
**Kjin**: This one, this was a payment.
**Kjin**: This is the one you're looking for.
**Asupit**: I guess.
**Asupit**: Are you, are you sure?
**Asupit**: Oh, sorry.
**Kjin**: Also that this Last sample number five, you are looking for a 10, $10,000 payment.
**Kjin**: But the retain age amount, the payment was 60,000 and some change.
**Kjin**: So this is the breakdown.
**Kjin**: This is what you're looking for.
**Asupit**: Oh yes.
**Asupit**: And then 55,000.
**Asupit**: 55,000 is the one we can trace it to the bank statements.
**Asupit**: Is that correct?
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Okay, got it.
**Asupit**: So yeah, that's fine.
**Asupit**: And then I can trace it to the.
**Asupit**: Looks like a July bank statements.
**Asupit**: 2024.
**Kjin**: Yes.
**Kjin**: July 2024.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Asupit**: Yeah.
**Asupit**: This should be sufficient enough.
**Asupit**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Kjin**: All right.
**Kjin**: So I'll.
**Kjin**: I'll get the rest for you and upload those.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Asupit**: We will get.
**Asupit**: We will just update this sample job cost sample to within next one or two hours.
**Asupit**: And then Jason will help us.
**Asupit**: And then Jason will ping you through the smartsheet and in and then for our further procedures, once you go through all the samples, that will be the, that the supporting documents will be the spreadsheet.
**Asupit**: Just go ahead and make a comments under the status columns.
**Asupit**: You can say like, like what I just showed you.
**Asupit**: You can say that need a sub selection for the expression something like that.
**Asupit**: And that is it can be much more like faster and easier for us.
**Kjin**: To make selection for you guys.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Kjin**: Yeah, sounds good.
**Kjin**: I think I'll go ahead and do that right now before jump on anything else.
**Asupit**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Kjin**: All right.
**Asupit**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Kjin**: All right.
**Kjin**: Thank you.
**Asupit**: Thank you.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: Bye.
**Evliao**: Thank you.
**Asupit**: Bye.
**Kjin**: Thank you.
**Justin**: Sa.
