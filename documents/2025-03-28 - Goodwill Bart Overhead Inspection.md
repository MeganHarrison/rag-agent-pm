**Acannon**: Okay.
**Ahuettl**: Is it going to be Andrew on site all next week?
**Acannon**: Yep.
**Acannon**: I think I'll be back here.
**Acannon**: Okay.
**Ahuettl**: So we.
**Ahuettl**: We have the framing at the student lounge entry that I'm going to reach out to Greg with Glenmark and see see if he can get a detail that we can show or if we can get any documentation showing that it's.
**Ahuettl**: It's okay.
**Acannon**: I mean I sent that, that I had Chad out there again afterwards.
**Acannon**: We went over this.
**Acannon**: You and I did.
**Ahuettl**: I guess he's.
**Acannon**: He came and re inspected it and said okay to Dremel.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah, he.
**Ahuettl**: He came, he came out and he.
**Ahuettl**: I guess he said yeah I inspected it but I also need something from an engineer or some documentation saying it's okay.
**Ahuettl**: So even with that letter I guess he wants more.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah.
**Ahuettl**: So I'll reach out for to Greg and we have the low voltage and electrical.
**Ahuettl**: They need to be independently supported.
**Ahuettl**: Oh there's that.
**Ahuettl**: And then wires touching sprinkler so that.
**Ahuettl**: That's what the electricians have.
**Ahuettl**: How many days do you think it would take them?
**Ahuettl**: A couple days probably for that day or two.
**Acannon**: I don't know.
**Acannon**: I mean it depends on how much there is.
**Acannon**: I.
**Acannon**: I don't recall seeing a bunch of stuff kind of.
**Ahuettl**: It's kind of hard to hear what you're saying.
**Acannon**: I don't remember seeing a bunch of stuff draped over the sprinkle long.
**Ahuettl**: Okay so it may just be a couple spots.
**Acannon**: Yeah I'm going in right now.
**Ahuettl**: Okay so that's maybe two days worth of work.
**Ahuettl**: You think?
**Acannon**: I mean I don't even.
**Acannon**: I really don't know.
**Acannon**: Like I don't know what all is there.
**Ahuettl**: Then removing the old hangers for the ceiling grid.
**Acannon**: Really?
**Ahuettl**: Yeah.
**Ahuettl**: That.
**Ahuettl**: That's a comment that you get.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah.
**Acannon**: Thank you.
**Ahuettl**: So we are good on the smoke detectors.
**Acannon**: I mean there's one on the drawing it.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah, it looks like only the daycare.
**Ahuettl**: So if it took maybe three days to do all this work.
**Ahuettl**: Well, if we do the work Monday, Tuesday, then calling the inspection for Wednesday.
**Ahuettl**: Are you able to plug that in and see see where that puts us see if it affects.
**Acannon**: Hey Andrew.
**Ahuettl**: I haven't talked to him.
**Ahuettl**: Is the only thing removing the old hangers from the ceiling, Is that the only thing that he has?
**Ahuettl**: Yeah, the averages.
**Ahuettl**: Okay.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah.
**Ahuettl**: If he's calling you just tell him to get outside and start working on it.
**Ahuettl**: Oh, okay.
**Ahuettl**: Okay.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah, it's just, it's the old hangers and what else?
**Ahuettl**: Give me a block on a choice now.
**Ahuettl**: Is it a lot of them?
**Ahuettl**: Yeah.
**Ahuettl**: Okay, I'll see what, what's in this contract.
**Ahuettl**: Okay.
**Ahuettl**: All right, sounds good.
**Ahuettl**: So it looks like it doesn't push itself.
**Ahuettl**: So, so we should still be okay.
**Ahuettl**: It looks like.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah.
**Acannon**: Remember a real in dates on the 18th.
**Ahuettl**: Oh, what's that?
**Acannon**: Our real end date is on the 18th.
**Ahuettl**: Okay.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah.
**Ahuettl**: So if we reschedule it for Wednesday, we'll, we'll be okay then from what.
**Acannon**: I can see, drop full ceiling ties 203 to 407.
**Acannon**: I don't think it'll take three days.
**Acannon**: So easy.
**Ahuettl**: Okay.
**Ahuettl**: That, that's all I wanted to see.
**Ahuettl**: And then I'm.
**Ahuettl**: I'm just gonna check if.
**Ahuettl**: If that's in Glenmark's contract to remove all those old hangers.
**Ahuettl**: I'm not sure if we had that or not.
**Ahuettl**: I mean typically I don't think you would do that, but.
**Acannon**: Yeah, no, I mean like it doesn't have much, it doesn't have any requirements on here.
**Acannon**: You must have an above something special.
**Acannon**: Prior inspection, electrical, mechanical, plumbing, fire.
**Acannon**: Expression fire stuff.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah, but that's all I was trying to see.
**Ahuettl**: So we'll, we'll shoot for a Wednesday inspection and should still be able to stay on schedule.
**Ahuettl**: And I'll look into the, look into that framing and see if I can figure something out.
**Acannon**: I get another Caesar dressing and then a knife too.
**Acannon**: Thank you.
**Acannon**: A knife and a Caesar dresser.
**Ahuettl**: You have anything to add?
**Acannon**: No.
**Acannon**: Little disappointed but I know that there's always going to be some shit that each inspector looks for that others don't but.
**Acannon**: Yeah, we just address it and make it right.
**Acannon**: Make it happy, get it done and close out the project.
**Acannon**: I mean not the first time I failed ones.
**Acannon**: Yeah, you never really know what they're gonna look especially on an old remodel like this.
**Acannon**: Like there was.
**Acannon**: There's a million things ever up there and he didn't.
**Acannon**: Everything that he talked about in the in wall inspection I addressed.
**Acannon**: So I capped off all the old H Vac that was going through the roof, removed all the low volt wire really all he pointed out during the in law.
**Acannon**: So I mean I addressed that, the framing for that, headers and I went through that add Glenmark, reframe it.
**Acannon**: Chad came out okayed it and now it's an issue that's annoying.
**Acannon**: Like I don't know what else we could have done in that situation.
**Acannon**: I had a good conversation, like, hey, we don't want to have to get an engineer out here because it's going to be expensive.
**Acannon**: And he was like, I understand that.
**Acannon**: I'm not trying to.
**Acannon**: You guys.
**Acannon**: Like, I'm on your team, too.
**Acannon**: Like, a little frustrating.
**Acannon**: If he tells us it's okay one time and then it's not, so Kind of annoying.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah, well, yeah, I'll let you eat.
**Ahuettl**: So.
**Ahuettl**: All right, talk to you later.
