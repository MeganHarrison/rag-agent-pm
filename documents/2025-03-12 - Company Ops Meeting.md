**Mcalcetero**: It was 75 and sunny in Indy yesterday.
**Njepson**: Really?
**Mcalcetero**: And will be today, too.
**Bclymer**: Candid.
**Bclymer**: Looks like.
**Acannon**: Like a terrorist holding cell or something where I'm at.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: Back to the corner here.
**Mcalcetero**: Expecting, like, two guys in a burka with AK47s to be behind you.
**Mcalcetero**: Making you read something.
**Njepson**: Drake.
**Njepson**: Barrel to the head.
**Acannon**: It's just Ridge Haven, that's all.
**Acannon**: Yeah, exactly right?
**Njepson**: Close enough.
**Mcalcetero**: Andrew looks healthy there.
**Acannon**: He does.
**Acannon**: We got a man down today.
**Acannon**: Andrew's not feeling well, so you won't be hearing any commentary from him.
**Acannon**: He's in.
**Bclymer**: Let me pull that.
**Bclymer**: You ready to do that?
**Bclymer**: This is what you want to print it, right?
**Acannon**: Yeah.
**Acannon**: Is this the same thing as the same thing?
**Acannon**: I just put some notes on it.
**Acannon**: I told people, like, we got to have some cues to jog our memory.
**Gducharme**: SA.
**Mcalcetero**: Jesse, is there anybody at Goodwill today for Going to Goodwill today?
**Acannon**: Well, I just found out about 30 minutes, seconds ago that no one was going there.
**Acannon**: So we'll figure that out.
**Acannon**: All right, so like, what we want to do is every once a quarter, just get together with everybody, you know, and as we're moving forward, we're going to be hiring more people and they come on board just to keep us all kind of aligned.
**Acannon**: And then, you know, it's not often we get to talk to accounting and Maria all at the same time.
**Acannon**: So, you know, it's a good time.
**Acannon**: I have some points on here.
**Acannon**: We'll just go through these items and then, you know, everyone can have a chance to chime in if they got any questions or, you know, or want to know how maybe we're doing things that's causing someone else more work or more trouble.
**Acannon**: That's what we want to, you know, become a better team so that we're all working together.
**Acannon**: We started out, you know, with the highlighted success and challenges and, you know, successes is like, you know, we're looking to double the amount of work at a minimum than we did last year, which is gigantic.
**Acannon**: Like companies don't normally do that.
**Acannon**: That's a brand has done it three times now.
**Acannon**: So he's, he's the exception to that.
**Acannon**: But with that come, you know, our challenges is hiring and, and building the team of people that can run the work successfully.
**Acannon**: One thing that's going to help us out a lot, he starts in two weeks, is an estimator.
**Acannon**: So full time, all he's going to do is assist with the estimating.
**Acannon**: You know, we've all chip in and it's not going to be where we don't have to do anything.
**Acannon**: But at least the, whoever PM is probably going to be assigned to that project will be, you know, he'll do all the legwork and in the end of it you can get together.
**Acannon**: You know, we'll use our, our knowledge and expertise to make sure we're putting out a good estimate that allows us to be successful.
**Acannon**: Just a brief review of the projects.
**Acannon**: I mean, right now we have Collective, the Westfield Collective.
**Acannon**: It's in permitting, it's about to start.
**Acannon**: We have Goodwill, Barton, Bloomington.
**Acannon**: They're in progress.
**Acannon**: We have Aspire, Ridge haven and the St.
**Acannon**: Lucie project.
**Acannon**: Ridge havens in progress.
**Acannon**: St.
**Acannon**: Lucie starts on Monday.
**Acannon**: We have Cormark, that's the job in Georgia.
**Acannon**: Alex is currently there.
**Acannon**: There's Burnville starting up immediately here in the immediate future we have Cart Cold Storage which is, you know, it's in progress, finishing up phase one and two.
**Acannon**: Well, phase one, Phase two is going to kick off very shortly and that's a lot of work.
**Acannon**: And then we also have Ulta, Dallas.
**Acannon**: You know, we got other smaller jobs going, but you know, that's.
**Acannon**: What is that?
**Acannon**: That's nine jobs we got ongoing.
**Acannon**: We got nine people on here.
**Bclymer**: You know, that doesn't include the, the two in, in Kentucky that, you know, I got stuff on yesterday.
**Bclymer**: We got to get started on design.
**Bclymer**: Also we've got Paradise Isles, which is massive.
**Acannon**: Yeah, that's the upcoming project.
**Acannon**: You want to take that, you know.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I mean, so, yeah, so.
**Bclymer**: So before we do that.
**Bclymer**: So highlight.
**Bclymer**: I don't know if yours is different, but I, I put the highlight.
**Bclymer**: Successes and challenges are the first thing.
**Acannon**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So if you want to go ahead and go into that.
**Bclymer**: Jesse.
**Acannon**: Well, I just was saying the challenge is hiring the people.
**Acannon**: The successes is just landing, you know, all this new work.
**Acannon**: Successful to double three times.
**Acannon**: Yeah, successful, successful.
**Acannon**: That's successful.
**Acannon**: You know, we're putting the processes in place and getting things written down to make us all understand, you know, anyone without direction, it's tough to.
**Acannon**: You do your job if you don't really know what you're supposed to be doing.
**Acannon**: And you know, so that's going to be very helpful as we move forward and just breaking into and brand.
**Acannon**: You're better at talking about successes.
**Bclymer**: Well, let's highlight Andrew.
**Acannon**: So Andrew.
**Acannon**: Yeah, there's a very success.
**Acannon**: Look, Andrew started a year ago or less than a year ago, didn't know really anything about construction.
**Acannon**: Now the guy is helping write contracts and change orders and estimating putting estimates together.
**Acannon**: Has a.
**Acannon**: Starting to build his knowledge of looking at a drawing.
**Acannon**: He's on a job site now running it as the superintendent.
**Acannon**: So learning how to manage people and schedule people.
**Acannon**: Like that's a lot of.
**Acannon**: That's a big, a big jump from day one.
**Acannon**: And one thing I can tell you is Andrew never tells you no.
**Acannon**: And you, you ask him to do things besides today size today, which I asked him to come to work and he didn't do and, but like just taking on the challenge and it's never say no.
**Acannon**: He stays here as late as he needs to get things done.
**Acannon**: And I mean that's, that's just.
**Acannon**: You can't instill that in a person that you gotta be kind of born with it.
**Acannon**: And I think Andrew, we can all give Andrew a round of applause.
**Acannon**: A great first year, Andrew.
**Bclymer**: So, you know, the biggest thing, a lot of things can be taught that can't Be taught.
**Mcalcetero**: Good work, Andrew.
**Bclymer**: Andrew, if you were here, that's $1,000 cash.
**Bclymer**: Of course you're not.
**Bclymer**: So I'll just hold on to that till you are here.
**Bclymer**: So, you know, another guy that kills it is Jesse, and he passed his Nasca.
**Bclymer**: And so as a little thank you, that's $10,000 cash.
**Acannon**: All right, I'm taking the day off.
**Acannon**: Andrew, you and me, we're going to, we're gonna go get some trouble.
**Acannon**: So thank you, Brandon.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, no, thank you guys.
**Bclymer**: I mean, I, I, it, you know, giving that kind of thing out, I love it.
**Bclymer**: And you know, hard work, it can't be taught either have it you don't like.
**Bclymer**: And if you guys have read the success manual, you know, that's one of the things that we talk about is that kind of person you can learn.
**Bclymer**: We're all, you know, learning every day.
**Bclymer**: We don't know anything.
**Bclymer**: You know, everything is construction, it changes.
**Bclymer**: But being able to learn and adapt and do what, you know, what matters and what's needed for the company to grow is huge.
**Bclymer**: You know, as, as we keep growing, you know, which we've got some really massive projects coming on.
**Bclymer**: I mean, I've got, I've got so many things that I can't even get to.
**Bclymer**: I can't take meetings.
**Bclymer**: And so, you know, I'm so grateful for, for Jesse to be able to, to, you know, do a lot of the ops, because if he wasn't able to, to help you guys and grow, like, I couldn't go get us anymore because I'd be in the weeds too much, you know.
**Bclymer**: Andrew, you've really, you've shown a lot.
**Bclymer**: I mean, it's just going to take time for you to learn.
**Bclymer**: But, you know, going down there to Bart, you know, and, and that job wasn't set up like it should be for you, you know, going in there and where it's an easy pass off and, you know, you've taken it and you're, you're running it and I'm not hearing bitching from you, which is great because you're doing what's needed.
**Bclymer**: And so that's just a little appreciation.
**Bclymer**: But, you know, as you guys learn and as we grow, I mean, people have to get moved up.
**Bclymer**: I mean, that's just part of it.
**Bclymer**: And so I, you know, I want to do more of this kind of stuff.
**Bclymer**: So that's just, that's a little thank you to both of you guys.
**Acannon**: Thank you.
**Acannon**: And I think it's just when you talk about bonus time coming up Like Brandon is like one of the most generous owners I've ever, I know I've ever worked for.
**Acannon**: And so it's all you.
**Acannon**: You'll make your, you'll be rewarded for that hard work.
**Acannon**: So.
**Acannon**: But yeah, we talked about upcoming projects.
**Acannon**: You know, we have Collective Florida, you know, we're getting that design started.
**Acannon**: Goodwill of Indiana's.
**Acannon**: We got two more projects coming up with them at least this year.
**Acannon**: Three probably.
**Acannon**: Probably three.
**Acannon**: We got the Danville Theater, you know, great clips.
**Acannon**: AJ's got two or three of those looking to start Applied engineering in the design phase right now.
**Acannon**: That's going to start.
**Acannon**: We've got the FedEx for the Neiman and that's going to get started.
**Acannon**: And then Cart cold storage phase two, which is a giant.
**Acannon**: It's probably the biggest, that'll be the biggest job in the company's history once that gets going.
**Acannon**: So like that's still coming up this year.
**Acannon**: You know, luckily some of these other jobs, that's why it's important we do our part to finish a job out, get it done and get it off our backs because you know we're going to get all clogged up if we can't finish one and move on to the other.
**Acannon**: So it's important to keep that in mind.
**Acannon**: If there's any other upcoming that I left off, I mean those are the.
**Bclymer**: Those are the ones.
**Bclymer**: I mean we've obviously got, you know, Uniqlo and some of these other, other jobs that are not set in stone, but there's a good chance that we'll be doing them.
**Acannon**: Yeah, you know, an estimating.
**Acannon**: I didn't list all the ones in estimated, but Uniqlo is a good one.
**Acannon**: That's a very promising Georgia Collectives already ours we just haven't got, you know, that one's just a little behind the other one in Florida.
**Acannon**: There's a Stonegate Apartments, Monon yard, you know, and then there's great clips that AJ is working on.
**Acannon**: You know, I didn't mention the one like there's one in Florida that could be five to ten years worth of work for us that Brandon's working on right now.
**Bclymer**: Paradise Isles.
**Bclymer**: So I submitted our bios yesterday.
**Bclymer**: You know, hopefully it passes and goes through, but that'll be a billion dollar development.
**Bclymer**: It'll.
**Bclymer**: They'll have two condo towers, hotel, several townhomes.
**Bclymer**: It's got a park, dry storage, redoing the marina.
**Bclymer**: It's got like two apartment mixed use buildings and I think an office component.
**Acannon**: So that's exciting that down in Florida.
**Acannon**: So I know the area well.
**Acannon**: Next thing, just, you know, using the latest technology.
**Acannon**: Like I said, I'm not the best at some of the new stuff, but as we learn it, you know, we're all transitioning from procore to job planner.
**Acannon**: You know, there's new things on that.
**Acannon**: So we encourage everyone spend a little time each day just going through that, you know, and as we, you know, go from one to the other, we're, you know, also if something doesn't work right, or something doesn't work that's efficient, you know, we have the ability to get with them and they can reprogram things and, and then the biggest thing is notion.
**Acannon**: We've decided to use that and it's really limitless in the tools and the things you can do with it as far as organizing, you know, your activities.
**Acannon**: We're working with that now with accounting, which we'll get to later on expenses.
**Acannon**: All of our jobs are on now that are estimating or, or in progress.
**Acannon**: So you can use that instead of, you know, writing notes on paper that, you know, they just go away.
**Acannon**: If you throw it away or you lose it, you put things on there and you can add the task to it and you can really organize and just sort it.
**Acannon**: So you're just seeing your items, you know, and you know, other people, myself, Brandon, A.J.
**Acannon**: you know, we're going to add tasks and put people on projects and it gives you a kind of a glimpse into the future where you could possibly go, you know, you'll be able to see all those things.
**Acannon**: So I encourage everyone to get into that notion.
**Acannon**: Is there anyone here that hasn't actually went in and looked at notion?
**Acannon**: Nobody?
**Acannon**: Okay, so that's good.
**Acannon**: So just start going in there again.
**Acannon**: We'll get into the expensing later.
**Acannon**: The next thing we had on here was the project status reports and PSRs.
**Acannon**: So I haven't gotten to review all of them yet.
**Acannon**: I've looked at some of them.
**Acannon**: But like this is, you know, moving forward as we expand and get bigger, you know, the teams will get bigger, there'll be more managers, you know, over projects.
**Acannon**: And if you think about, you know, we talk about Brandon's time, it's best spent getting and developing clients and client relationships and getting us more work.
**Acannon**: What he shouldn't be doing is worrying about the financial status and the, the, the, you know, the job finishing on time, things like that each month because it becomes an easy one page document with the backup, you know, these, the backup, you know, we didn't really Push for that this week or this month because it was the first one.
**Acannon**: But you should be putting these.
**Acannon**: There's RFI log material, status log, subcontractor log, and an updated project budget so that if anything jumps out to myself or Brandon on page one, which is, do we have a drastic increase or decrease in the profit?
**Acannon**: Do we have a drastic increase or decrease in the timeframe of the being completed?
**Acannon**: You know, do we still have a bunch of subcontractors not on board or a bunch of submittals open?
**Acannon**: Like, we can go to that backup and it's all there.
**Acannon**: But again, it's all about like a one page document which I've used for years with other companies I've worked for.
**Acannon**: I had to put that together each month and turn it in.
**Acannon**: And it's critical for us to understand the financial, you know, health of the company and also for accounting and payments, you know, all those things are on there.
**Acannon**: And you as a manager become aware of, you know, is this owner paying you?
**Acannon**: Do you need to make some calls?
**Acannon**: And, and so if you guys have.
**Bclymer**: You know, read the book Extreme Ownership, like chapter three or four talks about leading up and down a chain of command.
**Bclymer**: And so the premise of that is, you know, Jocko and his crew, you know, they would want to submit to their commander, you know, the higher ups that were in a different city to go on missions.
**Bclymer**: And then they get all these questions back.
**Bclymer**: What about this?
**Bclymer**: What about this?
**Bclymer**: What about this?
**Bclymer**: You know, his guys would get pissed off, like, oh man, you know, we know what we're doing.
**Bclymer**: Like, can't they trust us?
**Bclymer**: All that stuff.
**Bclymer**: And you know what his thing was, like, you have to take out any doubt, right?
**Bclymer**: And so they started submitting their request permissions.
**Bclymer**: And it had all the detail you could think of.
**Bclymer**: It had different contingencies.
**Bclymer**: It left no doubt to where they read it, like, okay, yeah.
**Bclymer**: And what that did was it developed trust to where they got to a point where anytime they submitted anything, it was approved because they fully trusted them.
**Bclymer**: This is that same kind of thing.
**Bclymer**: So whenever, like, Jesse and I have to, to like, come ask you questions or we can't find where something's at because it's not, then that doesn't build trust.
**Bclymer**: But when we look at something and it's like, yep, that's in order.
**Bclymer**: This is good, this is good.
**Bclymer**: That builds more and more trust, which in turn means that, okay, this guy is fully autonomous, we can trust him.
**Bclymer**: We don't have to check on him, which in turn is going to make you more money and help you move up.
**Bclymer**: Because now that's less time that we have to spend on that and more time doing things that benefit everybody else.
**Bclymer**: So think about that.
**Bclymer**: Like, it can be annoying doing all this kind of paperwork and stuff, but until you get that done to where it's just rinse and repeat and it's so clear as day, like, that is how you build that trust.
**Bclymer**: Because we're talking about these projects are too big and there's too much on the line for me to just wait till the end and hope that what you said is accurate and that we get to the end of the job and we made money and it's on time and everything like, got done all right.
**Bclymer**: Like that's, that's, you know, you mess up and next thing you know there's a million dollars and we're closing the doors.
**Acannon**: Yep.
**Acannon**: And that's what's too is critical, like, if you want to move up and become a manager of other people.
**Acannon**: Like, that's easy for us to promote someone if, like, they got it to us all the time.
**Acannon**: It was right.
**Acannon**: You know, they know what to look for and to, you know, manage the people below them.
**Acannon**: So another thing I want to talk about is OAC meetings.
**Acannon**: We want to make this a standard.
**Acannon**: Something that's standard.
**Acannon**: So repeat clients, you know, they come to expect, you know, the type of meeting we're going to run.
**Acannon**: I want to make sure that our meeting agendas, like it should be only things that affect the owner or needed architect input, you know, or a decision by them.
**Acannon**: You know, we don't want to put anything on there that we're internally working on or handling.
**Acannon**: It just needs to be just a review of things that are going on.
**Acannon**: You know, the project site for the meeting participation.
**Acannon**: We want to make sure it's always the PM and the superintendent should be on all those meetings sometimes.
**Acannon**: Senior pm, project Execration vp, you know, Brandon, we aren't always available for those, but it should be.
**Acannon**: You too, should be the project manager leading it, going through the items.
**Acannon**: Superintendent should always be prepared to give a recap of what's happening on site.
**Acannon**: Just a general review of the progress made in the previous week and some things that are upcoming that's in the topics.
**Acannon**: What does it affect the owner?
**Acannon**: Do we need an answer from them?
**Acannon**: Like, those are things we definitely need to have on that agenda.
**Acannon**: Because you get on a bigger job and your agenda's five pages long and those dates keep creeping out there.
**Acannon**: Well, when you get delays and you can push that, you know, point to that meeting where like you guys just aren't making a decision.
**Acannon**: You just need to hammer home things like that.
**Acannon**: And then also anything that's an information that's helpful to them we can put on there topics not to discuss.
**Acannon**: Like if we haven't got something resolved on our end before a meeting, we shouldn't be asking each other about it before because the meeting's not for us.
**Acannon**: The meeting is simply, it's all for the owner.
**Acannon**: So if there is something on there that isn't fully resolved, you can just tell them that we're still working on this.
**Acannon**: We just want you to know that it's out there and we're going to be needing your direction at a later date.
**Acannon**: The other thing that's critical is the meeting minutes.
**Acannon**: It doesn't do any good to have a meeting, have all these discussions and us trying to type things in because we're not listening during the meeting.
**Acannon**: We need to have the meeting.
**Acannon**: You know, we, everyone should have fireflies set up now.
**Acannon**: They can give you a review of everything said in that meeting.
**Acannon**: So we need to go through, find all that in there.
**Acannon**: Like anything people you know that's relevant to the issue, commitments or, you know, decisions are made in that meeting.
**Acannon**: We need to just type that in there afterwards.
**Acannon**: You know, your meetings will go a lot quicker if you're just moving through things and getting through it and then you go back.
**Acannon**: I mean actually it's not extra time.
**Acannon**: You'll probably save yourself some time getting those comments in there and get that agenda or the meeting minutes out.
**Bclymer**: So one thing with these meetings, like here's a really cool trick and I, I do this a lot of times like when we just call each other on teams.
**Bclymer**: When you, if you look at the top of your teams window, you'll see it says chat people raise hand, react, view notes, apps.
**Bclymer**: And then there's a thing that says more actions.
**Bclymer**: If you click on more actions, there's a button that says record and transcribe.
**Bclymer**: So you can click that and transcribe or record every meeting you have.
**Bclymer**: And then that way everything's written down and recorded.
**Bclymer**: And so after the meeting you can go back and follow up and detail the notes and make sure that it's exactly right.
**Bclymer**: There shouldn't be a meeting that we have that is not recorded, even if it's on site with clients.
**Bclymer**: Pick up your phone, go to Voice memo and record it.
**Bclymer**: And then you take that transcription, throw it in ChatGPT and then you've got Notes.
**Bclymer**: And then it's a simple email.
**Bclymer**: Hey, Andrew.
**Bclymer**: Per our meeting on site.
**Bclymer**: Whatever it is.
**Acannon**: It'S that technology people like myself need to learn how to use everything available.
**Acannon**: Next thing, weekly progress reports.
**Acannon**: So items to be included in a report, we need to make sure the status of all scopes in progress.
**Acannon**: You know, those are the things we want to, to.
**Acannon**: To report on, you know, what hap.
**Acannon**: You know, if a sub was out there working that week, make sure that what they've done is on there.
**Acannon**: The schedule we need to make sure, like, you know, our schedule, however it's printing out, I've just seen some of them where there's three activities, but there's 10 things going on there.
**Acannon**: So we either don't have our schedule updated correctly or we just need to make some adjustments.
**Acannon**: But when we send out that schedule to the owner, it should show everything that's happening in that week.
**Acannon**: Items to be discussed in the report.
**Acannon**: Here again, if they affect the owner or we need their direction or approval, it's a weekly report where you can add those things like, you know, items that we need to know.
**Acannon**: Because when they look at it, a lot of times reports go out to not only the direct manager of whatever owner we're talking to, it goes to their boss.
**Acannon**: So it's really a way to not throw anyone under the bus.
**Acannon**: But if you're not getting results, you know, they can get prodded by their superiors as well.
**Acannon**: Sometimes on the photos attached to the report.
**Acannon**: You know, when I was superintendent doing my weekly reports, like I would have, I would search through the photos to make sure there's no safety violations in it.
**Acannon**: It's clean, it's organized, and, you know, it's something that's like, interesting or different than the week before.
**Acannon**: If we send the same picture over and over again, that's kind of boring.
**Acannon**: But, like, that report is permanent.
**Acannon**: It represents, you know, us as a company and how we run our work.
**Acannon**: And if the job site's a mess, then we're not doing something right if we can't find four or five photos each week that look good.
**Bclymer**: And if you don't know how to take pictures, get with Maria.
**Bclymer**: She can help coach you.
**Bclymer**: And also, every Friday when these reports go out, you're sending it to, you know, me, Jesse, and then, you know, project team and the ownership, whoever needs to see it on that end.
**Bclymer**: And make sure you include Maria on all these too, so that she gets them.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Because she's going to use that stuff for different marketing tools.
**Njepson**: Yes, please.
**Bclymer**: And Please go and like and share.
**Njepson**: And comment ourselves on social media.
**Bclymer**: Thank you.
**Acannon**: Thank you, Maria.
**Acannon**: Next weekly subcontractor meetings.
**Acannon**: You know, as a superintendent on site, there should be no reason unless it's Christmas or New Year that you don't have a weekly subcontractor meeting.
**Acannon**: Always like topics to discuss, everything in progress and the activities coming up.
**Acannon**: This is where you got a chance to coordinate with the subs, make sure they know what's coming up and gets them talking to each other.
**Acannon**: Sometimes, you know, they'll just, they just don't talk to each other unless we interject ourselves in there.
**Acannon**: And that's our job to manage those subs and coordinate what they're doing.
**Bclymer**: We dictate the schedule, not the subs, you know, so you ask their opinion, right?
**Bclymer**: Say, hey, here's what I'm thinking.
**Bclymer**: Do you see anything wrong with this?
**Bclymer**: Does this work?
**Bclymer**: But they don't dictate the schedule.
**Bclymer**: We do.
**Bclymer**: Okay, we, you need to understand and know how this flow works.
**Bclymer**: And then again, oftentimes definitely, you know, ask for their input.
**Bclymer**: Here's what you know.
**Bclymer**: Does this work?
**Bclymer**: Is there anything you need?
**Bclymer**: Is there anything holding you up?
**Bclymer**: Like those are the things to ask.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah.
**Acannon**: And that's the next comment.
**Acannon**: With schedule, like we have to review at least at a minimum the two week look ahead schedule with our subs each week so that again, everyone's on the same page and they're, you know, that's where you find out if they don't have enough help, you know, maybe a foreman on site.
**Acannon**: We need to call up their PM or their whoever's running their manpower.
**Acannon**: And then again, meeting minute distribution is very important.
**Acannon**: You know, the Fireflies takes the meeting minutes.
**Acannon**: People commit to things.
**Acannon**: You put that out there in writing and then the next week you're not arguing with them about why they're not done because they've made those commitments and we've got it documented coordination and schedule updates.
**Acannon**: You should have a schedule meeting at least every two weeks with your subcontractors.
**Acannon**: You know, and everyone on that job site should get the invite to that meeting.
**Acannon**: You know, the ones that are on site should be mandatory that they are in attendance at this meeting.
**Acannon**: Typically on a bigger job.
**Acannon**: I would make the subs that we had any work coming up a month ahead of that schedule meeting, they had to be in attendance to make sure that they were aware that they were supposed to be there.
**Acannon**: And knowing what's going on.
**Acannon**: When it comes to updating a schedule every two weeks, we need to do that update and it has to be sent out to everybody.
**Acannon**: Doesn't matter if they were in the meeting or not.
**Acannon**: That schedule update goes out and it's.
**Bclymer**: Not just sending it out via Job Planner or procore because a lot of times that goes to spam and trash.
**Bclymer**: And yes, you've got the caveat of well, it was sent out, blah, blah, blah.
**Bclymer**: But our goal is never a gotcha.
**Bclymer**: Our goal is to get the job done, okay?
**Bclymer**: And just because we might be protected and you know, they, they still an argument.
**Bclymer**: It's still a delay, it's still a pain in the ass.
**Bclymer**: It still costs money.
**Bclymer**: Instead, send it out via email to everybody.
**Bclymer**: Hey, here's the updated schedule for every project.
**Bclymer**: You can create a group with all of your subs on there.
**Bclymer**: You know, so the goodwill bark sub list, goodwill, blah blah, blah.
**Bclymer**: It doesn't matter.
**Bclymer**: Like you could create those groups in Microsoft and then that way you have a set group and that should be studied out every time.
**Bclymer**: And then all you have to do is once you send out that email, okay, the next time that you're going to do it, go back into your sent, find that email, press reply all and then it's in the same thread.
**Bclymer**: And then every week it's right or every two weeks it's right there in the same thread.
**Bclymer**: There's no question.
**Bclymer**: But if you do that, you're going to eliminate people missing it, which in turn is going to help you because you want them to see it, say, hey, that doesn't work because of this because then you can correct it then instead of later as an argument and it screws everybody.
**Acannon**: That's right.
**Acannon**: That was the next topic.
**Acannon**: That is exactly what I had wrote down with the note to myself.
**Acannon**: So perfect.
**Acannon**: The drawing updates.
**Mcalcetero**: Is there a way?
**Mcalcetero**: One second, Jesse, is there a way in Job Planner?
**Mcalcetero**: Is this something we'll have to ask them to do?
**Mcalcetero**: In procore, when we uploaded a schedule, if you put the like the task name or whatever you want to call you do like a responsible party and then link it to that person so they got updates on all their tasks and when they were due and it got put in their calendar, is there a way we can do that in Job Planner where we tie each task to a sub.
**Bclymer**: You'd have to get in there and see.
**Bclymer**: I'm not sure if it has that ability or not.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay, okay.
**Acannon**: Again, the problem with that is, you know, procore job, it just inundates you with, with emails and notifications and it they do be at large.
**Bclymer**: It's the same thing.
**Bclymer**: Whenever, like, just like in building Connected, we send bid invites and the first thing I always tell you guys is now call them because they probably deleted their people get a ton of emails and different things.
**Bclymer**: Go to spam folder and they never even open it versus, you know, sending a direct email.
**Bclymer**: Like, oh, hey, this is from my project manager on this job versus oh, I just got another job planner email.
**Bclymer**: You know, probably some submittal that's not closed out or whatever.
**Acannon**: Yeah.
**Acannon**: So next drawing updates.
**Acannon**: So this is like also very important, you know.
**Acannon**: And especially, you know, you know, we're doing a lot of design build.
**Acannon**: When you have a typical owner architect relationship, like you have a set time to respond to those drawing updates and say it's going to cost money or not or else you own.
**Acannon**: We own that and we should be doing the same thing if you think about it the same way.
**Acannon**: So the first thing, saving the drawing update.
**Acannon**: You should immediately take that drawing update and upload it to either procore job planner.
**Acannon**: Whichever program the job's currently in, the drawing should be distributed to every single subcontractor.
**Acannon**: Doesn't matter if it affects them or not.
**Acannon**: It needs to be sent out to them and it needs to be sent out with a notice that you got 10 days, 10 business days to review these drawings.
**Acannon**: If it affects you at all, then you need to respond to us with the cost for that, whatever's changed.
**Acannon**: Because after that 10 days, they owe that to us for no cost as long as we, we make that, make that sent out.
**Acannon**: So that's a copy of it with that.
**Acannon**: And you know, we need, I don't know if they have a cover sheet that we can send drawings out with.
**Acannon**: If not, we just need to develop one that goes out with any drawing update.
**Acannon**: And you just set it to all the subs with the same blanket statement.
**Acannon**: You got 10 days to look at it.
**Bclymer**: And keep in mind, again, that's a, that's a, a cover.
**Bclymer**: But that is not the only thing you should be doing.
**Bclymer**: You should be sending out those drawings.
**Bclymer**: And you as a builder, not a construction manager.
**Bclymer**: We're builders should know what has changed.
**Bclymer**: And like, you know, like, hey, we're adding a wall.
**Bclymer**: Hey, Glenmark, you know, obviously we're, we're changing this wall.
**Bclymer**: You got that?
**Bclymer**: Because it's a change from the owner.
**Bclymer**: Okay?
**Bclymer**: They need to pay for it.
**Bclymer**: Now if Glenmark's like, hey, no, don't worry about it.
**Bclymer**: Okay, great.
**Bclymer**: But we should know that.
**Bclymer**: Guess what?
**Bclymer**: If I'm a good project manager, I'M going to throw a little money in there even if they're not going to charge me because I want to increase my profit.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: We're adding a wall.
**Bclymer**: We should get paid for that, you know, period.
**Bclymer**: And so you should know what it is.
**Bclymer**: So when you send those drawings out, you should have a narrative, you know, you should know what's changed.
**Bclymer**: You know, if just because the designer doesn't put it on there or whatever, you should know, you should be able to cloud it in Bluebeam.
**Bclymer**: Like you should know these things because again, you know, just sending it out there saying here, you check it.
**Bclymer**: And then they miss it, they're busy.
**Bclymer**: All we're doing is screwing them.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: And that's not what we want to do.
**Bclymer**: We want to, we want to do our job and make sure that everybody's good done.
**Bclymer**: Because it's not like us pointing it out costs us money, it helps us and they appreciate that.
**Bclymer**: Which in turn means that when you do up and you need a favor, they'll be your guy.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Acannon**: And then especially if something's deleted too, like we don't want to.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, you want to get the credit back.
**Acannon**: Get that credit back.
**Acannon**: Next thing, expense management, accounting.
**Acannon**: We're finally, we're to you.
**Acannon**: So this is PM Supers.
**Acannon**: Like everybody in the company has a company issued credit card.
**Acannon**: So saving receipts.
**Acannon**: Now there's been several different things that have been tried.
**Acannon**: You know, we're still like, if we find something better, we're going to move there.
**Acannon**: But for now, you know, if you make a purchase, everyone's got a phone.
**Acannon**: You should take a picture of that receipt.
**Acannon**: If you don't have a way of scanning it in.
**Acannon**: Keep that until accounting again, they're going to start.
**Acannon**: Everything's going to be done through Notion.
**Acannon**: They'll enter it into Notion, send you, you know, a notification of that.
**Acannon**: But again, those notifications, I get 100 of them a day.
**Acannon**: So you should be going in and checking.
**Acannon**: When they've actually got that transaction, it comes through on the card, there's a delay in that.
**Acannon**: And then you go into Notion and you upload that receipt.
**Bclymer**: So this is, this is Notion for those of you who haven't seen it.
**Bclymer**: So like this is, this is your dashboard, right.
**Bclymer**: So everybody will, everybody will have this dashboard here.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Now timesheets eventually will move in here too.
**Bclymer**: This is my dashboard.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So like here's all my open tasks that I have.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And then you know, here's credit card transactions, right.
**Bclymer**: And so you'll see all these transactions that Come in here.
**Bclymer**: And so then you'll just come in here, you'll put the project that it is, the cost code that it goes to, and then your cost type, right, what that's going to be.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And then you'll change your status to coded, okay.
**Bclymer**: And then that'll fall off your list accordingly.
**Bclymer**: And so you'll see everything over here.
**Bclymer**: This is where you put your receipts, any kind of notes.
**Bclymer**: Everything will come in here.
**Bclymer**: So you guys should all see this.
**Bclymer**: Whenever you log in to Notion, you should have this.
**Bclymer**: And so this will, this will help streamline everything because there's also a Notion app on your phone, you know, so you can even do this stuff on your phone, you know, to make it, make it even easier so you don't have to be on the computer.
**Bclymer**: And that goes with everything else, like your tasks, right?
**Bclymer**: Looking at that, your little reminders and notes.
**Bclymer**: If you want to take a picture and throw it in there, you can do that.
**Bclymer**: Like, it's pretty much open to whatever it is that you can do.
**Bclymer**: It's very, very useful.
**Bclymer**: So, like, even our direct cost for project managers is going to end up coming in here.
**Bclymer**: You're going to have a thing just like this that's going to have direct costs that need to be coded versus using those spreadsheets.
**Acannon**: And it's important when you code things like, you know, superintendents aren't as involved in the budget, but like, it has to be a code that's already existing.
**Acannon**: It has to match the type that it goes to because that, you know, it's automatically creating cost codes that aren't there.
**Acannon**: It makes it a mess.
**Acannon**: So please make sure if you are coding it, you're putting it to the right one.
**Acannon**: If you don't know, talk to your project manager.
**Acannon**: Is there anything else accounting that we missed on that that would help you guys out?
**Njepson**: No, under credit cards, that'll work.
**Njepson**: I don't know if you are going to get into AP invoices, but we can kind of, we can kind of talk about that to see what's the easiest way for us to get you guys the invoices and for you to code it back to us as soon as you can.
**Bclymer**: That's.
**Bclymer**: That's what I was just saying.
**Bclymer**: Those direct costs, currently we use those spreadsheets that will be moving into to Notion as well.
**Bclymer**: Just like what we're going to do with credit cards.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: Okay, you know, for now, like, like I said, you know, whenever we get done with this meeting, I'm going to look at where Our AP invoices aging report is that Excel sheet.
**Bclymer**: And if, if PMs have, that's not coded on there, you're going to get a call from me and it's not going to be pleasant.
**Bclymer**: Right?
**Acannon**: Okay, sounds good.
**Acannon**: Next.
**Acannon**: The last thing I had on here is communication between project managers, superintendents, or whoever it is that's managing that job, you know, on frequency.
**Acannon**: Like every day, every morning you guys should be talking, you know, starting to.
**Acannon**: Brandon, like I've been used to.
**Acannon**: I can't even remember the last time I wasn't like on, you know, other coming here.
**Acannon**: I was on a larger job.
**Acannon**: You had, you know, the whole team was there, so we met every morning.
**Acannon**: Anyways, you're just around each other in the office, but, you know, we have.
**Acannon**: Most of our projects are remote or, you know, not in, you know, in the same spot.
**Acannon**: So, you know, you just need to make sure you take the time, talk to each other because, you know, starting off your day, knowing what the other needs or what they have coming up, it's important to, to just be communicating with each other and making sure our guys in the field have everything they need or the guys in the field have, you know, that they know that their manager is looking for that information that they may need on site to keep things going.
**Acannon**: So, you know, their talking points, job activities, material status, any subcontractor issues, lacking information or drawings.
**Acannon**: Those are things that, you know, you, you know, just run through that checklist and it'll help you both.
**Acannon**: And then, and then just following up, if it involves an important matter, we should never say, well, I told him that, you know, two weeks ago.
**Acannon**: If, you know, if it's something that's important, follow that up and say, hey, email them or message him.
**Acannon**: Say, you know, email's best.
**Acannon**: You know, copy whoever else is involved in that.
**Acannon**: Like, hey, we, we need this information so that, you know, we all forget and some of us more than others.
**Acannon**: And it's, it's.
**Acannon**: You put that in writing so that it's out there and it, it's something that's going to remind them to follow up on that, to whatever it is that you need.
**Acannon**: And then it's not a.
**Acannon**: No one's pointing fingers later on saying I told them to do this or.
**Bclymer**: That, you know, so every morning, you know, I mean, every morning, you know, Jesse and I talk, you know, at whatever, 6:30, you know, and then a lot of you guys, you know, he'll call you and everything and you guys talk.
**Bclymer**: What should be happening is your Project team.
**Bclymer**: So if you're a project manager and you've got, like, Nick, you know, so he's got Goodwill Bart, and he's also got Bloomington, okay.
**Bclymer**: He should be talking to Chad and Alex first thing every morning, understanding, okay, hey, you know, what are our critical items to get done today?
**Bclymer**: You know, what's going on?
**Bclymer**: What issues do you have, like, that.
**Bclymer**: That should be, like, just little things, like, you know, to make continuous progress on what's happening.
**Bclymer**: You know, one thing that I do is every day I'll take a little sticky note and I'll write, like, the date, you know, so.
**Bclymer**: So 312 goals, and I'll write, you know, maybe three to five things that, like, I have to get done today.
**Bclymer**: Like, just little things.
**Bclymer**: Okay?
**Bclymer**: And you can use that same kind of method or whatever you want, but you have to understand to make continuous progress every day.
**Bclymer**: So if I'm a superintendent, Sorry, I'm on a call.
**Bclymer**: All right, well, why don't you mute yourself, dumbass?
**Bclymer**: So every day, you know, you should have, like, what are the things I can do to make continuous project on what the ultimate end goal is?
**Bclymer**: Right?
**Bclymer**: So if I'm a superintendent, you know, I might be like, okay, Like, I know where we're at in the schedule.
**Bclymer**: So, you know, one of my goals might be, all right, well, I'm going to call, you know, all the subs that are due next week, you know, today.
**Bclymer**: I'm gonna make contact with them.
**Acannon**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: That's key.
**Bclymer**: Like, because calling them and not getting a hold of anybody doesn't do.
**Bclymer**: Like, you can run on a treadmill all day and not do anything.
**Bclymer**: Like, that's not making progress.
**Bclymer**: So making contact with them and confirming, hey, you're set.
**Bclymer**: You need anything good?
**Bclymer**: You know, another two might be like, hey, I'm going to do my in law inspection on the north side.
**Bclymer**: You know, I'm gonna double check and make sure everything's done there, and I'm really just going to hone in on that, you know, and my.
**Bclymer**: My third thing might be.
**Bclymer**: Okay, hey, I'm going to, you know, make, like, have a.
**Bclymer**: A cleanup crew, you know, or whatever.
**Bclymer**: I'm going to do something.
**Bclymer**: But, like, every day, little things that you're like, I'm going to get this done today, right?
**Bclymer**: To make sure that you're continuing making progress.
**Acannon**: Yeah, and it helps.
**Acannon**: Like, Nick, don't forget you're calling Candon, too.
**Acannon**: Like, when you.
**Acannon**: You're talking to different people on different jobs, and Alex says, I'm doing this today.
**Acannon**: I got to check this.
**Acannon**: And then you, you're thinking, well, Canon's about the same position on his job over here.
**Acannon**: Doing that.
**Acannon**: Like, and then when you call him, you bring that up and, you know, you're just helping each other, you know, keep track of things.
**Acannon**: And.
**Bclymer**: And it's a team too, right.
**Bclymer**: So it's not just a superintendent reporting to a pm.
**Bclymer**: It's like, all right, what do we got going on?
**Bclymer**: Right?
**Bclymer**: So it's, you know, here, here's what's going on the field.
**Bclymer**: Boom, boom, boom.
**Bclymer**: All right, here's.
**Bclymer**: Here's what's going on on the office thing.
**Bclymer**: Like, like, it's a teammate.
**Bclymer**: Like, there should never be any.
**Bclymer**: That's not my job.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: It needs to get done.
**Bclymer**: It gets done, period.
**Bclymer**: Like, that is the team aspect of it.
**Bclymer**: That is getting it done.
**Bclymer**: Like superintendent and pm.
**Bclymer**: You know, one's just in the field, one's in the office.
**Bclymer**: But by no means should it be like, oh, well, that's not my job.
**Bclymer**: I don't cross pollinate.
**Bclymer**: Because if that's your mentality, then you're never going to move up.
**Bclymer**: Because to get to a higher level, you have to know how to do both jobs.
**Bclymer**: Jesse and I can run in there and run the field or the office better than anybody here, period.
**Bclymer**: Hands down, we've done it a thousand times.
**Bclymer**: You have to get to that level because you have to be able to teach people.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Acannon**: And that's what we want for everybody here.
**Acannon**: I mean, I want one of you guys running this meeting someday.
**Acannon**: You will eventually, because I'm not going to be around forever, but, you know, that's.
**Acannon**: Everyone's goal should be to move up, I would hope, you know, and you got plenty of opportunity.
**Acannon**: You know, the way this is rolling, like, we'll be doing $100 million a year in five years.
**Bclymer**: Two.
**Acannon**: Two years.
**Acannon**: Sorry.
**Acannon**: Yeah.
**Acannon**: So.
**Bclymer**: What questions does anybody have?
**Bclymer**: We'll open the floor.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Acannon**: Does everyone think this is helpful that we do this?
**Acannon**: We'd like to do it once a quarter.
**Mcalcetero**: I got one thing.
**Mcalcetero**: So how, like, how can we figure out how to, like, like, Andrew's taking my spot at BART right now.
**Mcalcetero**: Like, how can we figure out a way to, like, really transfer it over for, like, that duration?
**Acannon**: Like.
**Bclymer**: So he's talking about, like, coverage, right?
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, because, like, I, I tried to set him up as best as I could.
**Mcalcetero**: I had all the subs, I met with them, I called them, I told them, hey, I'm not going to be here.
**Mcalcetero**: Here, here's what you're doing.
**Mcalcetero**: And then Andrew gets there and then they start doing something that that's not what I told them.
**Mcalcetero**: And then we had that show on Friday.
**Bclymer**: So a couple things.
**Bclymer**: So first of all, like if it were me leading up to that meeting, I would have a meeting with you and Andrew.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So you, you, you, Andrew and Nick sit down and be like, here's what's on the table, here's what's supposed to be done, you know, on the job site.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: So just like what I showed you in Inspector with the easels, you know, here's every sub, here's the task every day for the next two weeks on what should be getting done, you know, and then your drawings are there and anything that's not covered and again a list of things that need to get done.
**Bclymer**: So like hey, we need to have this done, we need to have this done, blah, blah, blah, like just that kind of checklist.
**Bclymer**: Especially when you're talking about somebody with not a lot of experience like Andrew, like he doesn't know how to run a job.
**Bclymer**: So it's like, hey man, you know you need to go and look at, you know, all these corners on this wall or hey, you need to, to check this or like whatever that is that is up here, you have to put on paper for that person.
**Bclymer**: Like those, those are the things.
**Acannon**: Because well, but putting it on paper, if you're doing a weekly subcontractor meeting and sending out meeting minutes and you're doing a bi weekly schedule meeting and sending out those minutes and you got your sometimes weekly OAC meetings, all those things are there that you can say, here you go, here's eight documents.
**Acannon**: Read through it.
**Acannon**: Like all these subs are committing to all these things and these are the activities going on now and these are activities coming up.
**Acannon**: Like there's the documentation.
**Acannon**: Like, like to Brandon's point, like yeah, there's some things you're not going to put.
**Acannon**: Patch this wall or make sure they finish this on a, typically on a meeting like that.
**Acannon**: Those are the things.
**Acannon**: So now you're just down to downloading some specific little points of things they need to look for but they're not there later on they've got all the backup to talk to the subs if it's been documented properly.
**Acannon**: Like the sub isn't going to tell them like I'm not being done here or I wasn't going to do that here or I was going to do these things there.
**Acannon**: If, if it's, if it's documented, all he has to do is pull Out a paper.
**Acannon**: I mean, that gets rid of the show and, and the confusion about how that.
**Acannon**: What's happening on that job.
**Bclymer**: Eliminating ambiguity is key.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, well, it's no different with Bloomington.
**Bclymer**: When your new super comes on, I don't just want to hand everything over to him like, it's all you.
**Bclymer**: I for stay there for two, three days with him and okay, look, this is what we've got going.
**Bclymer**: Get him used to those subs and phase myself out.
**Bclymer**: And that way they know because, I mean, again, coming from the subcontractor world, when you throw a new super in there, they're gonna look at the new guy like, oh, we can do what the hell we want.
**Bclymer**: Well, so the difference is.
**Bclymer**: So one of two things like that can't always happen when you're talking about a situation with Alex where you've got coverage.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: And two subs may think that about everybody else.
**Bclymer**: They won't think that about Alito because they know that every superintendent that comes on site here, there's a standard.
**Bclymer**: And you're not getting away with, like, it doesn't mean that you can.
**Bclymer**: Nobody's going to get walked all over.
**Bclymer**: And so that's the standard that we have to keep.
**Njepson**: It's.
**Bclymer**: It doesn't matter if your name is Alex, you know, Chad, Jack or Candon.
**Bclymer**: Like, this is the way that we run jobs here at Alito and anybody can run in and take over and.
**Bclymer**: And immediately get moving.
**Bclymer**: There is no, like, oh, well, he said this.
**Bclymer**: Like, oh, really?
**Bclymer**: Well, I got the meeting that says this, so.
**Bclymer**: What are you talking about?
**Acannon**: Yeah, yeah, if we had the luxury of overlapping people.
**Acannon**: Yeah, obviously that's the best, you know, but sometimes that's not.
**Acannon**: Not an option.
**Acannon**: So just like I said, if it's.
**Acannon**: You've got documentation of what you've discussed with the subs and if you're not discussing in enough detail with them in your meetings, then that's a problem too, of what's happening.
**Acannon**: You know, you're not covering all the issues if, if it's not in there.
**Acannon**: You know, if you can't come out of a meeting with the minutes showing your plan with those subs to run that job and what they commit to, then you're not asking the right questions or talking about enough items.
**Bclymer**: Good question.
**Acannon**: Yep.
**Mcalcetero**: I got a bone to pick with Glenmark when I get back.
**Acannon**: Well, one thing we always do, like there's, you know, if we are not looking at ourself and what we're doing, how we're managing, and it's always someone else's fault.
**Acannon**: Like, we're never going to become a better manager because we want to blame other people.
**Acannon**: And I'm not saying so.
**Acannon**: Like, I've had plenty of argument with the sub and a vendor, but if I come into it, I can.
**Acannon**: I just.
**Acannon**: Like, I'm clearly showing you how you guys did not do things correctly, you know, because we always want to look at our.
**Acannon**: You know, how we're managing our work first.
**Acannon**: Yep.
**Acannon**: Camden.
**Acannon**: How's everything going up there?
**Mcalcetero**: Good.
**Njepson**: Making a lot of noise out here.
**Njepson**: So.
**Acannon**: Got any comments?
**Bclymer**: No.
**Njepson**: I do like the whole Notion thing as far as streamlining, like, the receipts and all that stuff.
**Njepson**: It's all in one place, so, yeah.
**Mcalcetero**: I do like the Notion app.
**Njepson**: That does feel pretty good.
**Acannon**: Good.
**Acannon**: A.J.
**Acannon**: now, if you want to unmute yourself, I'll let you talk.
**Mcalcetero**: I meant to click on my boarding pass.
**Mcalcetero**: All right.
**Acannon**: TSA's got him arrested.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: No fly list.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Mcalcetero**: No, I got nothing, guys.
**Mcalcetero**: Keep at it.
**Mcalcetero**: I've.
**Mcalcetero**: We've changed a lot in a year.
**Mcalcetero**: Grown a lot.
**Mcalcetero**: And there's a lot more where that came from.
**Mcalcetero**: So just thankful for Jesse for coming in and helping us get these processes down, and we'll just keep at it.
**Mcalcetero**: Absolutely.
**Acannon**: Fritzi, we know.
**Acannon**: I've never heard your voice.
**Acannon**: Everything good on your end?
**Njepson**: Yes.
**Njepson**: Hello, everyone.
**Acannon**: All right, now you put a face to all the people that you get information from.
**Acannon**: Morning.
**Bclymer**: Awesome.
**Bclymer**: All right, everybody.
**Bclymer**: Appreciate it.
**Acannon**: All right, thanks.
**Bclymer**: See you.
**Njepson**: Thank you.
**Njepson**: Bye, guys.
**Crusin**: Thank you.
