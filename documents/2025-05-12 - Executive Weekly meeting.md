**Speaker 1**: Or to apply for an unrestricted commercial license, submit a bond in lieu of a financial statement.
**Speaker 1**: And we already got it because Lisa send it to us.
**Speaker 1**: Use a surety bond in lieu of financial statement.
**Speaker 1**: That's already done.

**Speaker 1**: These ones.
**Speaker 1**: So she said these three references we will use.
**Bclymer**: What is it?
**Speaker 1**: So it says the individual giving the reference, not the person applying for the Arkansas contractor license must complete this form and complete it legibly.
**Speaker 1**: So I said to you, can we already pre fill it and send it to these people?
**Speaker 1**: But I don't know if they are clients.
**Bclymer**: So scroll up to where it says the reference like in the application.
**Speaker 1**: So let me just.

**Speaker 1**: Okay, here.
**Speaker 1**: So number three.
**Speaker 1**: But so now that I'm seeing the document, it doesn't say we need the references.
**Bclymer**: So this says three references on forms provided in 8, 9 and 10.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, sorry, sorry.
**Bclymer**: References should not be a supplier.
**Bclymer**: So that those three references are all suppliers of ours.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, so we cannot.
**Speaker 1**: But wait a second.
**Speaker 1**: So you said this one and then reading the other article, the other document.
**Speaker 1**: We don't need it.
**Speaker 1**: I mean I don't see the true references.
**Bclymer**: Okay, go back to the other article.
**Speaker 1**: So this is unconrestricted.
**Speaker 1**: And then here.
**Speaker 1**: So that's what I want to ask Andrew.

**Speaker 1**: So we don't need to complete the other ones.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.

**Speaker 1**: Questions one to seven on page two.
**Speaker 1**: This is you.
**Speaker 1**: So we already.
**Speaker 1**: I already filled them up, but we need to make sure that everything that it says there makes sense.
**Speaker 1**: So this is a reference.
**Speaker 1**: We don't need this.
**Speaker 1**: This, this.
**Speaker 1**: This is what we need.
**Bclymer**: This is it.

**Speaker 1**: So we need one through seven.
**Speaker 1**: Yes to seven.
**Speaker 1**: So one through seven.
**Speaker 1**: We don't need the three references.
**Speaker 1**: And seven.
**Speaker 1**: This is what we need from you.
**Speaker 1**: So I fill it out, but I need to make sure that everything makes sense and it's correct.
**Bclymer**: That was correct.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, so that's good.
**Speaker 1**: And then we don't need criminal background because it says if.
**Speaker 1**: And then this is already filled up by them.
**Speaker 1**: So we need to add the page from Lisa, not this one.
**Speaker 1**: And then that's it.
**Speaker 1**: We're done.
**Speaker 1**: Awesome.
**Speaker 1**: So, okay, so this is it.
**Speaker 1**: But let me just make sure we have everything.
**Speaker 1**: So references, page one, if applicable.
**Speaker 1**: We don't need.
**Speaker 1**: If required financial statement.
**Speaker 1**: See financial statement below.
**Speaker 1**: And that's what we look.
**Speaker 1**: Or the Bond fully executed.
**Speaker 1**: 10,000 contractors.
**Speaker 1**: So that's done.
**Speaker 1**: So we're good to go.
**Speaker 1**: My question to you is.
**Speaker 1**: So let me make sure we have the Florida state contractor license and the bond filled from Lisa now.
**Bclymer**: So what about if applying other than an individual, remit a copy of your entity's Secretary of state information showing that the company is currently registered, but you.
**Speaker 1**: Are applying as an individual.
**Bclymer**: No, no.
**Speaker 1**: Other than a company.
**Speaker 1**: Hold on.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Other than an individual.
**Bclymer**: So if you're applying.
**Bclymer**: Accepted.
**Bclymer**: Not an individual, submit a copy of your.
**Bclymer**: We don't.
**Bclymer**: We have a Secretary of State for Arkansas.
**Speaker 1**: Not for Arkansas, but this is of your entity.
**Speaker 1**: Of your entity.
**Speaker 1**: Secretary of State information showing that the company is currently registered.
**Speaker 1**: It shouldn't be from the Indianapolis One.
**Bclymer**: No, this is saying, like, this is for the state of Arkansas, so they're going to want to see a license for the state of Arkansas.
**Bclymer**: So you need to go on to the.
**Speaker 1**: Actually, I think already Andrew did It.
**Speaker 1**: So I need to confirm with him.
**Speaker 1**: I think he already said he had us already registered.
**Speaker 1**: So let me do something.
**Speaker 1**: So I know Andrew is coming back tomorrow.
**Speaker 1**: So I'll have everything set up on the folder.
**Speaker 1**: I'll call him, I'll make sure everything is checkbox and then the only thing we need is just send it out to the address.
**Speaker 1**: That's it.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So double check it.
**Bclymer**: Because what you'll probably need to do typically is you go to the state and you're going to register.
**Speaker 1**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: A foreign llc.
**Bclymer**: Because that's what we are.
**Bclymer**: We're foreign.
**Bclymer**: Meaning that we're not.
**Bclymer**: Like we're already existing, but it's a foreign state.
**Bclymer**: Different state than.
**Bclymer**: Than Arkansas.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, I'll check it out.
**Speaker 1**: But I think Andrew already did it.
**Speaker 1**: I'm not wrong.
**Speaker 1**: Other than that, we're good.
**Speaker 1**: So I'll just create a final package with everything and I'll add Lisa's page, you know, filling out the bond and then that's it, we're good to go.
**Speaker 1**: And then tomorrow we can send that.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, I'll call.
**Speaker 1**: I'll set up a meeting quickly with Andrew tomorrow morning.
**Speaker 1**: So that's it.
**Speaker 1**: So we can send it out and then the ticket.
**Speaker 1**: So we're good.
**Speaker 1**: Other than that, you already sent everything for or a hotel.
**Speaker 1**: No response from them.
**Speaker 1**: Payment for Dave was made for the sponsorship.
**Speaker 1**: I hope he can give you emails too.
**Speaker 1**: I saw he was going to.
**Speaker 1**: You know, you have a photograph following you, but hopefully you can email.
**Speaker 1**: Get emails too.
**Speaker 1**: So.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: What else other than that?
**Speaker 1**: So Ian.
**Speaker 1**: No, Ian, Sorry.
**Speaker 1**: The new person for the assistant pm.
**Speaker 1**: So he sent the offer letter signed, but he said that he will be outside and doing some stuff, so I think that's okay.
**Speaker 1**: He said that to Jesse on it?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: I'll just make sure with Jesse before he jumps in.
**Speaker 1**: Before creating everything.
**Speaker 1**: It's gonna take me like 10 minutes to create everything for him.
**Speaker 1**: But still, I just want to make sure it's.
**Speaker 1**: Everything is accurate.
**Speaker 1**: Other than that.
**Speaker 1**: That's it.
**Speaker 1**: From my side.
**Speaker 1**: That's it.
**Speaker 1**: Mgo, what are.
**Speaker 1**: Nothing.
**Speaker 1**: We just send the letters.
**Speaker 1**: Everything is on.
**Speaker 1**: You send the letters to the people that were missing, Correct?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: So I don't know, like, I don't know if there's anything else they're waiting on.
**Bclymer**: I guess we need to follow up on that.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, Abelina, thank you for that.
**Speaker 1**: I need to call.
**Speaker 1**: I'm following up with Evelina about the meeting with Daniel and then doing your social media today as well.
**Speaker 1**: And then that's it.
**Speaker 1**: From my side.
**Speaker 1**: What else do you need from me?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, that's it.
**Bclymer**: I mean, the audit is key.
**Bclymer**: So let's figure out what we're missing there.
