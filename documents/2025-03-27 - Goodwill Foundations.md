## Transcript
**Jared.rains**: Morning, Andrew.
**Amulder**: Morning.
**Jared.rains**: How we doing today?
**Amulder**: Doing pretty good.
**Amulder**: How are you?
**Jared.rains**: Good.
**Jared.rains**: Running 100 miles an hour as always.
**Amulder**: Yep.
**Jared.rains**: I was just going through marking up the drawings I sent over this morning.
**Jared.rains**: Just clarify some things that some of it's from our walkthrough and some is just.
**Jared.rains**: They had.
**Jared.rains**: It didn't have all the details just right but they have a lot of stuff.
**Jared.rains**: Pretty good shape.
**Jared.rains**: Yeah.
**Amulder**: I noticed the little kitchen area was.
**Jared.rains**: A little off, but Yep.
**Amulder**: Yeah, that's not really a huge deal.
**Jared.rains**: Yeah.
**Jared.rains**: Just you know.
**Jared.rains**: Yeah.
**Jared.rains**: Change it.
**Jared.rains**: Get rid of the stove.
**Jared.rains**: This wall doesn't exist.
**Jared.rains**: And just have a counter.
**Amulder**: Yep.
**Amulder**: Because.
**Amulder**: Yeah.
**Amulder**: That one's.
**Amulder**: That's just a receptacle for a fridge.
**Amulder**: Pretty much.
**Jared.rains**: Yeah.
**Jared.rains**: And then I think we needed.
**Jared.rains**: You wanted like a counter receptacle for microwave.
**Amulder**: Yeah.
**Jared.rains**: So add one in there.
**Amulder**: Me and Jared will both be driving so I'll probably have to talk through most of it instead of looking at it but.
**Jared.rains**: Okay.
**Jared.rains**: Where are you headed today?
**Amulder**: Portland, Indiana.
**Jared.rains**: How far is that?
**Amulder**: It's about two hours from Minneapolis north east.
**Jared.rains**: Huh.
**Jared.rains**: That's not bad.
**Amulder**: Yeah.
**Jared.rains**: Right off the bat this morning I went to get on the interstate.
**Jared.rains**: They had the, the ramp going.
**Jared.rains**: I don't know the interstates here but the one going west was just shut down.
**Jared.rains**: It was just a giant backup and then people were just going around where they shut it down and then cutting back in to get on the ramp anyways.
**Jared.rains**: So maybe they were just cleaning up a wreck or something.
**Jared.rains**: I don't know.
**Amulder**: But that's kind of crazy.
**Amulder**: Yeah.
**Amulder**: We do road construction.
**Amulder**: Very interesting here.
**Jared.rains**: Yeah.
**Amulder**: Years ago they decided to.
**Amulder**: When they do construction just to close the entire road which is probably better for the, for the workers but makes a big headache.
**Jared.rains**: Yeah, no kidding.
**Jared.rains**: Jared says teams is not letting him on.
**Jared.rains**: Let's see.
**Jared.rains**: See.
**Jared.rains**: What's Jared's email?
**Amulder**: Probably j reigns@willwillindy.org or it could be jared.reigns@willwillindy.org.
**Jared.rains**: Sa try this.
**Jared.rains**: 3170846 what the hell?
**Jared.rains**: I don't know what.
**Amulder**: I've had trouble doing it from my phone before.
**Amulder**: I don't know about the team's things or.
**Amulder**: Or what.
**Jared.rains**: I could just call them on the phone and.
**Amulder**: Yeah, that might work.
**Jared.rains**: Very accepted.
**Jared.rains**: Weird.
**Jared.rains**: Is he accepted now?
**Jared.rains**: I don't know.
**Jared.rains**: Just give him a call.
**Jared.rains**: Hey Jared, it's Jesse.
**Jared.rains**: I don't.
**Jared.rains**: Yeah, I don't know what's going on with this thing but I got Andrew on the meeting so he said you were driving anyways but so we can basically discuss really.
**Jared.rains**: So the main issue is this, you know, the asbestos, lead paint.
**Jared.rains**: And they also looked at mold, but that doesn't seem to be a concern.
**Jared.rains**: But so in review of it, you know, they did not find any asbestos on the lower level, only level 2 and 3.
**Jared.rains**: So technically there should be no reason we can't just polish that concrete.
**Jared.rains**: The only issue we'll have is in the stairwell on the lower level.
**Jared.rains**: You were asking about polishing it up into the stair, that bottom landing.
**Jared.rains**: We'd have to have them mitigate that.
**Jared.rains**: But thinking of the rest of the LVT they took up, they had the adhesive.
**Jared.rains**: I would think we're going to have to use someone to take out that carpet and BCT that goes in that hole coming off two big door, the double doors from the outside, you know, then in level two and three, if we're just going to put carpet tile back down, we shouldn't have to do anything with that because I said we, as long as we're just covering it, we don't have to do anything.
**Jared.rains**: The joint compound, they're saying, is throughout the building.
**Jared.rains**: So that would just affect, you know, all the wall cuts we have to do for outlets.
**Jared.rains**: We.
**Jared.rains**: We'd have to.
**Jared.rains**: For the asbestos in the drywall, we'd have to have them cut it out.
**Jared.rains**: And then because of the lead in the paint, we'd have to like have them scrape the paint back a foot or so on either side of where we cut to take care of that.
**Jared.rains**: Now, regardless if we're going to cut holes, we would have to get them to do that.
**Jared.rains**: You know, the only option for the paint, which I don't know if that'd be worth it, is to just laminate everything with like a quarter inch drywall.
**Jared.rains**: Kind of like we did at Goodwill when we covered all those existing funky wall panels.
**Jared.rains**: You.
**Amulder**: To the difference to them, I don't think, but I included out to see what the most cost effective is overall and then we can make a good decision from there.
**Jared.rains**: Okay.
**Jared.rains**: And at this point, like, we wouldn't even need our demo contractor basically because like everything that comes out would be by that remediation company.
**Jared.rains**: So that may not be a bad thing.
**Jared.rains**: You know, much of a difference maybe for them to demo it versus our normal demo guy.
**Jared.rains**: I don't think so.
**Jared.rains**: Just because it's not, you know, this isn't.
**Jared.rains**: If you look at it, you know, for their demo, all they got to do is wet the drywall to keep it from making dust.
**Jared.rains**: Because that's the thing Drywall does.
**Jared.rains**: You know, they just, it's.
**Jared.rains**: It's like a different asbestos that's hard to become friable, I guess they call it.
**Jared.rains**: So, so yeah, we'll look at that and see what.
**Jared.rains**: What that is.
**Jared.rains**: I always hate these companies that do the testing because they want to go in and remediate.
**Jared.rains**: So you see, they'll go overboard.
**Jared.rains**: But we'll get a couple different ones to look at it.
**Jared.rains**: Okay.
**Jared.rains**: Okay.
**Jared.rains**: Then on the, you know, they just said you can use a certified encapsulate encapsulant paint.
**Jared.rains**: So you know, that's, you know, I don't think we're going to do anything with the stairway, the wood, other than just paint it.
**Jared.rains**: We were going to paint all the stairwells so we can do that.
**Jared.rains**: The exterior metal door, we would just be painting that.
**Jared.rains**: The handrail, I don't think we're doing anything with that other than putting a bolt.
**Jared.rains**: There's a bolt missing Andrew noticed on the landing.
**Jared.rains**: Just to fix that.
**Jared.rains**: And then.
**Jared.rains**: Okay, yeah, I don't think it should be.
**Jared.rains**: Look at that.
**Jared.rains**: And then, you know, this is.
**Jared.rains**: They call out lead on first and third floor drywall.
**Jared.rains**: So that would mean second floor drywall wouldn't need to be the paint messed added just be the drywall.
**Jared.rains**: But there again at that point, you got one guy in there just doing all the demo.
**Jared.rains**: It probably make more sense.
**Jared.rains**: So I don't think this really.
**Jared.rains**: I mean, we'll still.
**Jared.rains**: I got the new plans I sent out and I'm marking them up right now with, you know, things that they've missed or they have drawn wrong from our architect.
**Jared.rains**: So I was going to get all those fixed.
**Jared.rains**: I talked to Emily and so, you know, we do we need to pull a permit.
**Jared.rains**: But she said they do a free expediting permit review now if the job is in Indianapolis and we're not changing the occupancy type.
**Jared.rains**: So that's why I did.
**Jared.rains**: If they've already converted this to office space, then we should be good because I guess it used to be maybe apartments back in the day.
**Jared.rains**: How would we find out what it's classified as now?
**Jared.rains**: Okay, perfect.
**Jared.rains**: Becca, she said they'll turn them around like two days, which.
**Jared.rains**: Exactly.
**Jared.rains**: Yeah, like Bloomington.
**Jared.rains**: Oh, I know, yeah.
**Jared.rains**: And then they keep coming out now.
**Jared.rains**: Now you need another permit and now you need another permit.
**Jared.rains**: And so we've submitted everything they need and you know, just like $64 permit for this and that.
**Jared.rains**: And so I got an email the other day from our civil engineer and they were asking, you know what's the status.
**Jared.rains**: And they're like, well, it's in queue and we'll let you know when it's approved.
**Jared.rains**: So it's crazy, right?
**Jared.rains**: And that is one thing.
**Jared.rains**: So I talked to your fence guy and he said, you know, you were wanting them to make sure we didn't have any issues with the permit before he actually ordered it.
**Jared.rains**: And it has, you know, eight week lead time.
**Jared.rains**: Are you.
**Jared.rains**: Do you still want to just wait till we actually get the approval or do you think.
**Jared.rains**: Okay, all right, I'll give him a call when we get off and just tell him to get that thing ordered.
**Jared.rains**: Shoot him an email.
**Jared.rains**: So he's got it in writing.
**Jared.rains**: Yep.
**Jared.rains**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jared.rains**: And he like the city didn't like, didn't disapprove it.
**Jared.rains**: So it's not that they're not going to approve it, you know, So I think it's fine.
**Jared.rains**: He was just running us through the ropes on all that.
**Jared.rains**: Okay, all right, I'll do that.
**Jared.rains**: And then the one thing I marked up, I would, I think at the end of the day we were going to do.
**Jared.rains**: Do you want us to rough in for the monitor like a wall mounted TV as well as a projector?
**Jared.rains**: Okay.
**Jared.rains**: Okay.
**Jared.rains**: Yeah, I think that that's about it.
**Jared.rains**: I'll continue getting these marked up and we'll get them back and then I'll send them over to you.
**Jared.rains**: So you got a plan?
**Jared.rains**: I'll get it over to Emily so she can then stamp them for permit and we'll just get this thing going.
**Jared.rains**: Get the pricing in to you.
**Jared.rains**: You know, obviously we got to get that first.
**Jared.rains**: So this will help clear up all of our subs on what they got to do.
**Jared.rains**: And then.
**Jared.rains**: Okay.
**Jared.rains**: And then I, I sent you the Bloomington this revised civils, they already got those back to us.
**Jared.rains**: And so Jer, not Jared, but Brian with Kinley Horn, he called him up, you know, and he was able to talk him into letting us modify the existing vault because if we had to replace it with a new ball, that gets expensive.
**Jared.rains**: And they're also going to let us reuse the existing backflow device in there so that all we got to do is add two butterfly valves on each side.
**Jared.rains**: And it's just because of their code they require 9 or I think at 9 inch minimum from the valve to the side.
**Jared.rains**: So that way we can just extended.
**Jared.rains**: You know, because it's a CMU bolt currently we can just pour new foundation.
**Jared.rains**: We'll pour in the sump pump and then just build the walls to match.
**Jared.rains**: And we can use a they make cementitious waterproofing that'll meet the requirement of their vault.
**Jared.rains**: And I'm planning on just pouring, you know, extending onto the.
**Jared.rains**: The lid that's there now and just dial into it or whatever we got to do and just pour a bigger cap.
**Jared.rains**: And then for the discharge, know there's.
**Jared.rains**: The drive drops down.
**Jared.rains**: So we should be able to just come right above the surface, you know, right below the surface of the ground and side discharge the pump through the curb, which makes that pretty easy install.
**Jared.rains**: And then by running the power like we showed it, and he's got it on his drawings and we don't got to rip up any additional asphalt or anything.
**Jared.rains**: We'll just run the power in the.
**Jared.rains**: In the landscaping along that wall.
**Jared.rains**: So we'll.
**Amulder**: So, not that they care, but I, at least I felt like it was helpful to have that conversation yesterday.
**Jared.rains**: That's awesome because Brian also is going to go back to him and see if we can resubmit everything while we're doing the easement revision because if they would allow us to do that by tomorrow, we should have all the drawings.
**Jared.rains**: Actually, I got it today because it was only civil comments.
**Jared.rains**: I'll.
**Jared.rains**: I would like to resubmit that to them if they'll agree to that.
**Jared.rains**: So I'm going to follow up with Brian this morning and see if he's able to get him to agree to that because I don't know how long the landlord.
**Jared.rains**: It will take.
**Jared.rains**: And then we got to get the surveyor back out to redo a survey in that.
**Jared.rains**: That portion.
**Jared.rains**: Okay.
**Jared.rains**: Okay.
**Jared.rains**: Okay.
**Jared.rains**: That's good to know on that.
**Jared.rains**: So I'll follow up with Brian right after here and I'll let you know if he was able to get that.
**Jared.rains**: Get that approval and we'll get him resubmitted today if so.
**Jared.rains**: All right.
**Jared.rains**: Awesome.
**Jared.rains**: Jared.
**Amulder**: So I disagree with everything he said.
**Jared.rains**: Oh, you couldn't hear.
**Jared.rains**: Sorry.
**Jared.rains**: Andrew said he agreed with everything you said.
**Amulder**: No, disagreed.
**Jared.rains**: Oh, disagreed.
**Jared.rains**: Yeah.
**Jared.rains**: Well, we got this firefly.
**Jared.rains**: So go back and review what we all committed to.
**Jared.rains**: Yeah, the only thing.
**Jared.rains**: Yeah, I need to show.
**Jared.rains**: I got to get the plumber to revise and show that backflow preventer.
**Jared.rains**: Well the inside where the water service comes in.
**Jared.rains**: So I'll need to get that today as well.
**Jared.rains**: I just don't want to flood them with a lot of the things we've changed.
**Jared.rains**: So they're trying to re.
**Jared.rains**: Review it, you know.
**Jared.rains**: Yeah, well, we're not damaging any trees, so I guess we're good there.
**Jared.rains**: Right.
**Jared.rains**: And I had a job In Florida that had a sinkhole and that was crazy watching that thing open up.
**Jared.rains**: It got like 20ft wide.
**Jared.rains**: Yeah.
**Jared.rains**: We had to bring in a.
**Jared.rains**: A grout injection truck and they had to just pump grout into where it was until it filled up.
**Jared.rains**: There's just like a fissure in the.
**Jared.rains**: The limestone and so.
**Jared.rains**: Yeah, it's crazy.
**Amulder**: That's awesome.
**Amulder**: Every family member's property, it just sooner or later disappeared.
**Amulder**: It was never a problem.
**Amulder**: They.
**Amulder**: They didn't understand that that wasn't normal.
**Jared.rains**: That's funny.
**Jared.rains**: Someday that'll be like a archaeologist dream.
**Jared.rains**: Yeah.
**Jared.rains**: Yeah.
**Amulder**: Keep us in the loop if there's anything else that we need and we'll keep plugging away and keep pushing this thing forward.
**Jared.rains**: Yep, Sounds good.
**Jared.rains**: Thanks, Jared.
**Jared.rains**: Thanks, Andrew.
**Jared.rains**: Yep.
**Jared.rains**: Bye.
**Amulder**: Yep.
**Jared.rains**: All right, Andrew.
**Jared.rains**: I guess tomorrow still noonish.
**Jared.rains**: Good for Bart.
**Amulder**: Yeah.
**Jared.rains**: Okay.
**Jared.rains**: Yep.
**Amulder**: That works.
**Amulder**: Sweet.
**Amulder**: Anything?
**Amulder**: He said that?
**Jared.rains**: No, he's just saying to, you know, we're.
**Jared.rains**: We'll get the.
**Jared.rains**: A couple remediation folks to give us quotes and if it gets crazy, then he said he could give us some other of the testing.
**Amulder**: Okay.
**Jared.rains**: And then he told me, go ahead, I know you're not on the curb cut thing, but I'm going to get the gates ordered for that.
**Jared.rains**: And then he said it's.
**Jared.rains**: He's had a good feed the city, I guess that other project in Bloomington they've delayed you on, he said they kind of feel bad about that, but they're aware of your time frame for having to get out of where you're at now.
**Jared.rains**: So whoever he was talking to at that meeting said they were going to try to push and get our permit approved so we could get going.
**Amulder**: Okay, that's good.
**Jared.rains**: Yeah.
**Jared.rains**: So that's what I'm saying.
**Jared.rains**: We can.
**Jared.rains**: I just need to get the plumbing to revise their drawing showing the backflow preventer and where the water service comes up in the floor and where we're going to move it.
**Jared.rains**: And I'll get that drawing to them today and then we should be able to resubmit if they'll allow us to resubmit while we're working on that easement revision.
**Amulder**: Okay.
**Jared.rains**: To show them.
**Amulder**: Yeah.
**Jared.rains**: All right, well, I'll let you know how that goes.
**Amulder**: Thank you very much.
**Jared.rains**: All right, thanks, Andrew.
