## Transcript

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Hi. Hi, Esme. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
How are you? 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
I'm doing good. I'm doing good. How are you doing? Oh, good. I for some reason thought this meeting was at 1, not 11. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
At 1. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
No. Yeah. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
I think I have another meeting. So I just wanted to ask you. So for the pictures with Annie Canal that I have you here, if the guys are there, they can just wear the best. And the hat just for the video, and then we just do it to. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Another person, you know, so it's faster. Yeah, I definitely agree. Yeah, I definitely. Yeah. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
So we don't need to wait for them for the shirt. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
So. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Yeah, yeah. So if they have. Because you have extra. So you can just, for example, cuff the meter and then just record it, guys. And then just, you know, tell them. You know, you know how to clean the lens and everything. So you can record them and tell. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Them and then just with the meter and that's it. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
So we can do that with the extra apparel that we have. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Okay, perfect. And then you said perfect. You said just like, three of the guys. Or did you want all the guys? 

**Maria Calcetero:**
So if we can have all the guys do. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
It will be awesome. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
I'm sorry. I think my Internet is very, very unsteady today. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
But I heard you. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
So if we can do the entire guys to do it, including Brandon and Jesse, awesome. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Yeah. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
If not three, it's perfect. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Okay. I think. I think we could definitely manage that. I think because it's not. It's not like it's a long video or like they have to talk or anything. They just literally have to grab the measuring tape and go like this. Can you hear me? Exactly? 

**Maria Calcetero:**
I can hear you, but I think it's my Internet. Let me do it with my phone, because I'm pretty sure it's my Internet. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Okay. Okay, no problem. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Give me one second. 

**Ashley Ortiz:**
Okay. Because you're not lagging anything. You're not laggy or anything like that. I actually need to review a lot of the AI right now. I didn't get to fully test it out. I just looked at all the sites. Mm. Florida. Hello? I see you. Can you hear me now? Yes. Awesome. Sorry, my Internet. Something happened with a tree, and then it just messed up the entire Internet for the day, so. Oh, no. Yep. Anyway, so what I was saying is you were mentioning that what happened with the AI tools. Oh, yeah. I wanted to say, like, I have all of them open. I just didn't get to test them all. Oh, it's okay. So what I wanted to do is just to make sure. Which ones do we want to try. So for me, the one I definitely want to try is Jasper because I think it's really good for managing marketing. Yeah. So let's type it out in here for our chat. One second. And this is. Yeah, that's the one I wanted to try out too. And I wanted to try out. Which one was this? Let me check where we found. So the ones that. So my favorites were Jasper Midjourney for sure. Descript and elements from Embed Envato. That's it. I don't know. What do you think? So which ones did you like to try? Try all of them. So. Right. Just take a look at them and let me know so then we can test them out. Perfect. Okay. Yeah. Did you. Did you look at motion or get Merlin? So I got the. No, I know Quill. Would you try it? And you liked it? Yes. Yeah, I mean it's like it doesn't do like a whole lot, but like it does a little bit and it does make a difference. I think at least like it just is good for to give you options. And then motion. Let me see. Yeah, I'm looking at it. Motion. That come correct? Yeah, it's just motion dot. I think it should be motion dot com. It was motion. So Lander. It was under productivity. But it says when you go to the website, at least that we had linked. It says like free picture editing download free image. Yes. Oh yeah. Motion. That is outlander. Yeah, you're right. So what do you think for productivity. So I. I want to trust you. Which the quillboard. So we can try them out. You already tried, so that's good. Yeah, the cool bot. And then this one is loading on my side. So let's see. Okay. Because my Internet, this is so upsetting. You know, I live not in the main city. I live like kind of like outside like kind of the suburbs. There's a lot of mountains here. So definitely a lot of things happen with different trees. Just one of them hit one of the Internet cable and they just saw that they're going to restore our Internet until 5pm and that's. And you guys are an hour behind us. So that's our six. Yes, exactly. It seems to be working like good. At least on my end because I can steer into you perfectly. But oh, and the VPN doesn't help at all. I guess not. Or a hotspot to your neighbors. So. No. So I am connected with my hotspot. The thing is, for example, my concern is because there's no light because the light went all down as well. So I cannot connect my laptop because there's no light, there's no Arduino power, so I don't want my laptop to die anyway. We'll see. So I like motion. That is. Oh, I think we can try and Merlin AI. I'm looking at it right now. Let me know. What did you think? Okay. Yes. Let me go ahead and look at it. Yes. Ideas are chat away, mirror links or product. Yeah, this is more like kind of like chat GPT. It's just giving you different options as well. Sam. It says it's noting. Yeah. Use your knowledge to research. Yeah, I think we can test it out too. It's just a matter of, you know, just typing in some stuff. So. Yeah, I guess I think I just lost track of time helping, helping Jessie and getting back to everybody. But I definitely really want to test all this out. Oops, I just jumped out. So what we're going to do, we're going to just divide us because obviously you're busy and myself as well. So I'm going to test it out. Jasper. Okay. Okay. I already know about midjourney. Brandon already knows about this script, so that's good. And Envato, I already know it. So you know what, if you want to try the productivity ones. Okay, I'll go ahead and do the productivity one. Yeah. So I can try all of. And I'll just like make an account like just to at least get like a full trial or something like for free to see what they fully offer. Perfect. Sounds good. Yeah. And then I'll do the same for our meeting on Tuesday. Okay. Okay. Perfect. Yeah, perfect. So I already tested the other ones in marketing, but if you just want to like, like you do, I'm just going to have like a comparison between them and why we should use it so you can do the same. Okay. With the productivity ones. Yeah. Okay, that'll be perfect. And it was. I think you already sent out the invite. I already sent it out for Tuesday. I think you already have it on your calendar. Yes, yes, I see. I know. I'm looking at the email, Annika. Just. Which reminds me that I need to send you guys my description to proofread. Yes. Should I, should I. I want both of your guys help on like the description as well. Like should I ask for Anika to send me like old descriptions she's made in the past for the other guys so I have a reference. Kind of like a distracted look off of it so we don't have it, to be honest. So the last time we did one was just like a fun thing about you as well. So you can say Ashley has been working over a decade, you know, like, organizing one of her passions since, for example, I don't know, nature. And also she loved photography and she's looking forward to help the company improve. Xyz. That's it. Okay. That's the only thing. Okay. So something super simple, something super chill and everything. Okay. Okay, sounds good. Yeah, it looked. It looked long when we were in the marketing meeting and I was thinking to myself, wait, how long does it actually have to be? But I'll make sure to get in just a few, like, sentences for a little caption for the post. Okay, that's awesome. That'll be awesome. Yeah, that's perfect. So if you can do that, that'll be great. And then send it to us if you want to. Or just to me, just to make sure. But something fun and cool about yoga. Okay, sounds good. Thank you so much. Maria, do you have any other questions for me? Okay, let me know as well. And then I'll try to be online. Otherwise, if it's not with my laptop, with my cell phone, because it's gonna take time. Oh, no. Anyway, hopefully we can get this fixed before 5pm yeah. Are there any places around that you guys could go to? Like a. I would say like a little cafe? But you have the earrings. I will try, but. Yeah, but the thing is, my daughter, I cannot help her. Yeah. So that's the thing. Anyway, okay, Ashley, thank you so much. And then we'll be in touch. Okay. Okay, thank you. We'll stay in touch. Thank you. Okay, bye. Bye.
