## Transcript
**Acannon**: Jesse.
**Acannon**: Hey, guys, how's it going?
**Bclymer**: 117 today.
**Acannon**: That is awesome.
**Acannon**: So does any, like wildlife hang outside during that?
**Acannon**: In that temperature?
**Acannon**: They all kind of just.
**Bclymer**: My dog will take a nap in the yard for two hours when it's that hot.
**Acannon**: Damn.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, it's unreal.
**Jremillard**: All right.
**Acannon**: So if we look, I'm going to pull the schedule or the estimate up here.
**Acannon**: Did you get your computer by any chance?
**Bclymer**: Not yet.
**Acannon**: What did they get you a tracking number for it?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, but it's only 11 o' clock in the morning here.
**Acannon**: Oh, yes.
**Jremillard**: I thought it was supposed to be delivered yesterday.
**Jremillard**: I thought it was supposed to be delivered yesterday.
**Bclymer**: It was today.
**Jremillard**: Oh, okay.
**Jremillard**: In here.
**Jremillard**: Talk about kitchen finances later.
**Jremillard**: All right, well, hopefully it shows up here soon.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, this must be there today.
**Acannon**: Is that it?
**Jremillard**: Seeing your calendar?
**Acannon**: Yeah.
**Acannon**: Share their own screen here.
**Jremillard**: Thinking at six.
**Jremillard**: What is that?
**Acannon**: Banking.
**Acannon**: All right, so.
**Acannon**: And we talked, went through this a little bit.
**Acannon**: Jesse.
**Acannon**: You know, I've gone through this with, with Alex and so I don't know if you want to just update us.
**Acannon**: You talk to any new people for each of these sections today?
**Acannon**: Because I think with the demo, we know that's going to be.
**Acannon**: That's in the plumber's number.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And I got two plumbers that I talked to today that both got the package from Andrew.
**Acannon**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And then a guy for like capturing all the little miscellaneous items.
**Acannon**: Okay.
**Acannon**: All right.
**Acannon**: And then the dock equipment, like those subs will just have them included in their proposal to relocate or whatever they're doing.
**Acannon**: Okay.
**Acannon**: And did have you talked on any of the dock equipment subs?
**Acannon**: Find out, do they do the concrete work as well or did you find out?
**Bclymer**: I haven't talked to them yet.
**Acannon**: Okay.
**Acannon**: Okay.
**Acannon**: We got railings and bollards.
**Acannon**: We're just going to plug a number for that.
**Acannon**: And then the railings, we should get a number from that sub.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, through everything with them this afternoon.
**Acannon**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: The guy with that's catching all the miscellaneous stuff.
**Acannon**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So yeah, he can get railings and fencing and all that stuff.
**Acannon**: Good.
**Acannon**: I still haven't done that drawing for the fence, so.
**Acannon**: So he'll do the plywood as well?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, he'll catch that.
**Bclymer**: FDR and the John's room, sir.
**Acannon**: Hey, is he do the insulation, all these?
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: He's gonna look at the ceiling in the insulation.
**Acannon**: And then you also have big companies.
**Jremillard**: What insulation does he have to do?
**Acannon**: So there's six inch bats in the ceiling of the new offices and then some wall insulation.
**Jremillard**: Gotcha.
**Acannon**: The do You.
**Acannon**: We got a couple roofers, don't we?
**Bclymer**: One I can get you.
**Acannon**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: I'll get another one.
**Jremillard**: We can always estimate that, too, you know, I mean, it's not like it's a ton.
**Jremillard**: We should count the units and the openings, you know, would call it whatever, you know, Thousand bucks per.
**Acannon**: Yeah.
**Acannon**: And what we're doing is, like, would, you know, if we have to plug in numbers, we'll do that tomorrow.
**Acannon**: But if we can get.
**Acannon**: If we.
**Acannon**: Are we turning this in?
**Acannon**: End of day Friday.
**Acannon**: That the plan?
**Acannon**: Yeah, so.
**Acannon**: So any pricing we don't get tomorrow, we'll just have to go and plug some in there.
**Acannon**: And then for a door sub.
**Acannon**: Andrew, have you sent this to any doors people?
**Jremillard**: I saw one guy respond to the plan up thing.
**Acannon**: Well, he's doc doors.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, we got doctors, but just regular doors now.
**Jremillard**: I don't believe.
**Acannon**: So.
**Jremillard**: Is there any storefront?
**Acannon**: Nope.
**Jremillard**: Wasn't there something at the main entrance?
**Jremillard**: But then there's like, a sprinkler pipe.
**Jremillard**: That's a hollow metal door, though, I think, right?
**Jremillard**: Or did they say that that's storefront?
**Acannon**: There's some storefront existing, but all we're doing is.
**Jremillard**: Well, that one door, they're taking from a 3.
**Jremillard**: 0 to a 6 0.
**Acannon**: Yeah, they just want hollow metal.
**Jremillard**: Okay, perfect.
**Acannon**: Yeah.
**Acannon**: And does your miscellaneous guy there, Jesse, do doors and hardware as well?
**Bclymer**: He can.
**Bclymer**: He's doing a storefront for me right now.
**Acannon**: Okay, we'll see.
**Acannon**: We can plug some numbers from those.
**Acannon**: So drywall and framing.
**Acannon**: You got your guy.
**Acannon**: He said he's just doing framing, just not the drywall.
**Acannon**: And one.
**Bclymer**: One is going to bid framing.
**Bclymer**: Only one is going to bid both.
**Bclymer**: And then I got another guy looking at framing and drywall as well.
**Bclymer**: He's just not sure if he's going to bid it.
**Acannon**: Okay.
**Acannon**: And then drywall, finish and paint.
**Bclymer**: So paint I can probably get through the one guy.
**Bclymer**: Do you want another paint to bounce this off?
**Acannon**: I mean, if we.
**Acannon**: If we get the job, then are we gonna put it out?
**Acannon**: Are we just trying to get a budget here?
**Jremillard**: Trying to budget.
**Jremillard**: I mean, when we get the job, obviously we'll buy it out because we got to do not only paint all the walls on the inside, drywall and everything, but where we cut in those levelers, they're gonna have to touch up all that paint, you know, on the precast.
**Jremillard**: Oh, ballers need to be painted outside, so.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, well, then we have to get a paint sub.
**Jremillard**: But if we can just.
**Jremillard**: I mean, we can do a takeoff, too.
**Jremillard**: And Get a budget number, you know, call it, you know, 150A square.
**Bclymer**: So is it safe to call this the budget number round and then we'll do the actual bidding that.
**Jremillard**: Yes, exactly what it is.
**Jremillard**: Yep.
**Acannon**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: That's going to make it easier to get more bidders.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jremillard**: Just budget and then, you know, we've got, you know, whatever.
**Jremillard**: Is it next week or the week after?
**Jremillard**: You know, we've got finals coming in.
**Jremillard**: Do we have a number per design?
**Jremillard**: Do we, do we have an architect?
**Jremillard**: I haven't.
**Acannon**: There you go, Jeff.
**Jremillard**: No, they're not licensed down there.
**Bclymer**: I said jail.
**Acannon**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: Jeff was shelf with studio access.
**Jremillard**: I don't want to use them anyway.
**Jremillard**: They don't do warehouses.
**Acannon**: Yeah.
**Acannon**: Jesse had a.
**Acannon**: That architect you have used around here.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Acannon**: Did I seemed like myself or you emailed them to see.
**Bclymer**: I just sent you Kevin's contact info over there.
**Acannon**: Okay, let me see here.
**Jremillard**: And then do we know that the MEP subs that you've talked to Jesse, they all have know it's going to be design build and can take care of those drawings?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, Access already has their electrical engineer working.
**Bclymer**: And then I texted the other guy this morning and I haven't heard back.
**Bclymer**: So I'm going to make around this afternoon to circle back with everyone I haven't heard from.
**Acannon**: Are you going to use your fire sprinkler?
**Acannon**: Guys?
**Acannon**: Brandon, the office sprinkler, which get local.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, local.
**Jremillard**: It doesn't, it doesn't make sense for us to do it.
**Jremillard**: It's not, not enough.
**Acannon**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: I also have another engineering company that I've worked with here if you need one.
**Acannon**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Pardon?
**Jremillard**: MEP engineer.
**Bclymer**: These guys, I believe do everything.
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, that's the thing.
**Jremillard**: We'll have to make sure that.
**Jremillard**: We'll have to make sure whatever design team, you know, architecturally especially like they understand, like, you know, it's not.
**Jremillard**: We can't wait three weeks to get started.
**Jremillard**: Like this is down and dirty.
**Bclymer**: Quick permits challenge here is getting stuff fast.
**Bclymer**: It's a very.
**Bclymer**: It's a really busy market.
**Bclymer**: So I'll work on options to make sure that everything happens fast.
**Bclymer**: This other engineering firm designed a mine and a mill.
**Bclymer**: So I know they can.
**Bclymer**: They have all the resources to do MEPs and all that, but they also do a lot of warehouse, it looks like, and commercial facilities.
**Acannon**: Okay, cool.
**Acannon**: And for the H Vac, you say you had some people for that?
**Bclymer**: Yep, they're already working on it.
**Acannon**: Excellent.
**Acannon**: And Andrew, so you've gotten them all access to job planner?
**Jremillard**: Yeah, everyone's in.
**Jremillard**: And then even the emails I've seen.
**Jremillard**: You sent some and Jesse, you sent some.
**Jremillard**: I threw those people as well.
**Jremillard**: We're the fire alarm that's not needed though.
**Jremillard**: Right.
**Jremillard**: So I can take it out?
**Jremillard**: Yeah, that's just.
**Jremillard**: I.
**Jremillard**: I'm just testing out Planet Hub.
**Jremillard**: I.
**Jremillard**: I told him give me a week, the trial to see what it's like, you know.
**Jremillard**: And like, so it's really fucked up.
**Jremillard**: Like, you can't like Building Connected where we can build bid packages and all that stuff like there.
**Jremillard**: You don't.
**Jremillard**: They don't have function like so like.
**Jremillard**: Because otherwise I didn't create a firearm bid package.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, right.
**Jremillard**: Like, I don't know, it's weird, like having people call me.
**Acannon**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: I didn't look at it just yet from wherever.
**Acannon**: So this.
**Acannon**: I went in that created a job for Aspire, the Kissimmee one, just to see about, you know, this is their.
**Acannon**: This bidding section of theirs.
**Acannon**: So I don't know exactly how honest.
**Acannon**: I don't know how it works.
**Acannon**: So.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, I haven't ever used it for either.
**Jremillard**: I just.
**Jremillard**: They gave us a.
**Jremillard**: You know, I told him we were interested, so they gave us a trial.
**Acannon**: But is it only you and me that can look at this?
**Jremillard**: Because like, no interest.
**Jremillard**: Should have access.
**Jremillard**: We can get Jesse, you know, access.
**Jremillard**: We just need to, you know.
**Acannon**: Okay.
**Acannon**: So I don't know if this would be helpful or not.
**Acannon**: I don't know what all these other things look like.
**Jremillard**: I've got a meeting with Construct Connect later.
**Jremillard**: But I mean, yeah, just use this and just roll with this Again, this is just a budget.
**Jremillard**: Like, you know, like just trying to see what.
**Jremillard**: What can fill the void since, you know, build it Connected.
**Jremillard**: Switched up their crap.
**Acannon**: Yeah.
**Acannon**: Because is Job Planner.
**Acannon**: Are they the ones.
**Acannon**: Are they expensive too, or.
**Acannon**: They're supposedly.
**Jremillard**: No, they're.
**Jremillard**: They're way more cost effective.
**Jremillard**: The issue with Building Connected is they switch their pricing model to percent of revenue, which that means like, you know, we could bid a $40 million job, not get it, but we have to pay as if that was revenue.
**Jremillard**: I was like, that makes zero sense.
**Jremillard**: Like.
**Bclymer**: Interesting that Building Connected used to be called Construction Online a long time ago.
**Jremillard**: Used to be called what?
**Bclymer**: Construction Online.
**Jremillard**: I'm not sure.
**Jremillard**: It's always been Building Connected for the last probably eight to ten years, I think.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, it was right around, I think, 2015 then.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, it may have.
**Jremillard**: I.
**Jremillard**: I've only used it since it was Building Connected, so I didn't remember.
**Bclymer**: The Construction Online sold and I Think that's what they renamed that thing.
**Bclymer**: I used it in the first platform it came out on.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, very possible.
**Bclymer**: So it's okay to just roll in actual hard bidders right now, and we'll just.
**Bclymer**: Whatever comes in for this week for budget numbers.
**Bclymer**: That's what we're running with.
**Bclymer**: But we still want to keep hard bidders online moving.
**Jremillard**: Yes.
**Acannon**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I'll push to get everything out a bit by the end of this week.
**Bclymer**: I'm off tomorrow, so that's going to help a lot to be able to connect with all these guys.
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Acannon**: Sweet.
**Jremillard**: What about exterior?
**Jremillard**: Don't we have.
**Jremillard**: We don't have any earthwork.
**Jremillard**: Right.
**Jremillard**: We're not.
**Jremillard**: We're just doing some striping.
**Acannon**: Yeah, we have.
**Acannon**: See, Got an employee lot, fence, restrap parking lot, and a guard shack.
**Jremillard**: A guard check.
**Acannon**: We're just going to price up to provide.
**Acannon**: Go ahead, Jesse.
**Jremillard**: I would say that guard check is probably just a.
**Jremillard**: Put a little curve on that it sits on.
**Jremillard**: That's about it.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I'm looking at just a DIY 10 by 12 with a few windows and doors.
**Bclymer**: And it's three grand.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, they're not much.
**Acannon**: They said that the.
**Acannon**: They roughed in conduits out there for the power and data, so we would just have to hold a wire in it.
**Acannon**: I think it's just.
**Acannon**: They're just sleeves.
**Acannon**: There's no wiring.
**Jremillard**: Easy enough.
**Jremillard**: Are we doing much to the roof.
**Acannon**: Other than just penetrations?
**Jremillard**: That's it.
**Jremillard**: There's a bid package has.
**Jremillard**: It talks about TP everything.
**Jremillard**: What's it saying?
**Jremillard**: What do you mean?
**Acannon**: That's another standard.
**Acannon**: That's just their standard language that HERMES just pulled this thing off of a.
**Acannon**: Yeah, like a generic generator.
**Acannon**: Generic.
**Acannon**: I can spit it out.
**Acannon**: Rfp.
**Jremillard**: What else?
**Acannon**: The lighting.
**Acannon**: Just so you know, Brandon, you updated that, sent it back to them.
**Acannon**: Splitting up the exit lighting.
**Jremillard**: Yep.
**Acannon**: Then what was that?
**Acannon**: What was our light numbers?
**Acannon**: I put them in here.
**Jremillard**: It was one.
**Jremillard**: Nine.
**Jremillard**: Something.
**Jremillard**: I don't.
**Jremillard**: Off the top of my head.
**Jremillard**: Exit signs were like.
**Jremillard**: It was like 97 or 87.
**Jremillard**: I think.
**Jremillard**: 87.
**Jremillard**: He's doing.
**Jremillard**: Or who's.
**Acannon**: Who's doing those?
**Jremillard**: I.
**Jremillard**: I just did take off.
**Jremillard**: I just.
**Jremillard**: I just did a takeoff.
**Jremillard**: I plugged like 750 a light, you know, and then like.
**Jremillard**: Does Dean able to go out and work there?
**Jremillard**: Yeah, they can, but it doesn't make sense.
**Jremillard**: A, we got them on, you know, however many other projects.
**Jremillard**: B, like, Jesse's got relationships and there's.
**Jremillard**: There's plenty of local qualified electrical Subs in Phoenix like we don't need to haul Dean down there to work on something like this.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, like it's not a.
**Jremillard**: This is a warehouse.
**Jremillard**: This thing is not hard.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: Like these things are super easy to build.
**Jremillard**: Like it's not going to take a lot.
**Jremillard**: I'm not even.
**Jremillard**: I'm not sure on, you know, how big some of those areas are.
**Jremillard**: But like you know, one thing too to think about, like in that main office area, break area.
**Jremillard**: I imagine depending on how big that break area is, it's probably going to be an assembly area which means we need to rate that wall to be two hour rating that demising wall.
**Jremillard**: So just make sure to probably plug some firestop in.
**Acannon**: Which one though?
**Jremillard**: In the main office.
**Jremillard**: Again, I don't know the size of it, but assuming it's, you know, large, it's going to house, you know, a few hundred people.
**Jremillard**: It probably is going to put it as an assembly area which means that we'll have to rate that room against the warehouse.
**Jremillard**: I mean I'm almost certain that Arizona Falls ibc.
**Jremillard**: It could be wrong, but I would think so.
**Acannon**: I'll pull the plan up here.
**Acannon**: Share the screen.
**Acannon**: This is Jesse from job planner.
**Acannon**: So makes it.
**Acannon**: This is the main office.
**Acannon**: Like these walls here don't even.
**Acannon**: They just stop at like 10 foot.
**Acannon**: They're not even full height.
**Acannon**: So they permitted and got that approved back in the day anyways.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, but I mean that's like those, those.
**Jremillard**: None of those rooms are as big as what that break room is.
**Jremillard**: That's what I'm saying.
**Jremillard**: Like how big is that break room right there?
**Jremillard**: It tells you right there.
**Acannon**: 40, 50 people.
**Jremillard**: 58 times 42, 144 people.
**Jremillard**: So I'd have to double check the code.
**Jremillard**: I can't remember if that puts it in.
**Jremillard**: I think we might be okay.
**Jremillard**: I think it's 150 to be honest.
**Jremillard**: So maybe okay, 10 because like this.
**Acannon**: Is all just open.
**Acannon**: This is like a 10 foot tall wall we're building here.
**Jremillard**: Yep.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: I mean assuming that's.
**Jremillard**: I mean it should be right.
**Jremillard**: We just got one set of double doors.
**Jremillard**: So if it was a simply area, I think we'd have to have two double door exits.
**Acannon**: I got a single coming out here.
**Acannon**: A double there?
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: What are these tugger stations they got so Tugger.
**Jremillard**: That's what they use to like pull trailers around in the yard.
**Jremillard**: Oh yes.
**Jremillard**: Or it's what Jesse did when he was coming up in school for extra money.
**Bclymer**: They called a fluffer back then.
**Acannon**: I made Good money, guys.
**Bclymer**: Pension.
**Acannon**: Have you been able to look at these drawings at all, Jesse?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I got them on my desktop on my other computer.
**Acannon**: Okay, I gotta update this.
**Acannon**: He said they.
**Acannon**: They have 16, you know, the reach.
**Acannon**: There's an email that just came out this afternoon from.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, I saw that.
**Jremillard**: From Christian.
**Acannon**: Christian and Jared.
**Jremillard**: Do.
**Jremillard**: You know.
**Jremillard**: So, Jesse, if you.
**Jremillard**: If you want to, like, ask your electrician, you know, like, you know, whoever it is that you're working with, like, hey, like, we need a number.
**Jremillard**: Like, not only for the whole thing, but we need to know also what the lighting is going to cost.
**Jremillard**: You know, for this, I want to.
**Jremillard**: Ideally, I hope I covered it.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, they're giving it as a line item.
**Jremillard**: Okay, great.
**Bclymer**: Is that how you wanted it with the new lighting package with a few thousand lights?
**Jremillard**: Yeah, yeah, whatever the number is.22 something.
**Bclymer**: Just so you know, when I set these up, I'm trying to communicate to all these guys to kind of line item everything out.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Get a bit of detail out of.
**Jremillard**: It or it's easier said than done.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, that's why I said I'm trying.
**Jremillard**: All right, cool.
**Jremillard**: J.D.
**Jremillard**: what else do we need to do?
**Jremillard**: Go over.
**Acannon**: I don't think so.
**Acannon**: I just need to.
**Acannon**: We'll knock out a fence drawing so you got something you can send to people.
**Acannon**: Then we got something we'll tell them we're budgeting for and say we'll knock this thing out.
**Jremillard**: All right.
**Jremillard**: I'll follow the bill and see if I think we're getting ideally with.
**Jremillard**: You know, I wrote that, you know, to try to get some urgency so we can get a PO to get them hooked.
**Jremillard**: And, I mean, obviously from the responses, you know, they're putting it up the chain to get approval.
**Jremillard**: It sounds like.
**Jremillard**: Damn.
**Jremillard**: So, Jesse R.
**Jremillard**: Were you able to get the parking lot information that you needed for striping, that you were asking yesterday?
**Jremillard**: You were needing.
**Acannon**: Area size or the.
**Jremillard**: Size of the parking lot?
**Bclymer**: You're asking me?
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Last I noticed, we're getting quantities of spaces, handicap spaces, lineal foot of fire, curb, things like that.
**Acannon**: I need to get.
**Acannon**: Let me email Christian now.
**Jremillard**: All right.
**Jremillard**: Anything else?
**Acannon**: I think that's it.
**Jremillard**: Cool.
**Jremillard**: Thanks, guys.
**Acannon**: See you.
**Bclymer**: Thank you.
