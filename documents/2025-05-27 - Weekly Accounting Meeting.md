## Transcript
**Accounting**: There's getting to be more notetaker apps in the meetings than people anymore.
**Bclymer**: I know, right?
**Bclymer**: I got tired of mine.
**Bclymer**: I don't let it in anymore.
**Bclymer**: It's like unless I need to take notes, I just let it hang out out there.
**Accounting**: Yeah.
**Fnjie**: Asking Brandon if he's gonna join in then.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: How is everybody?
**Fnjie**: Good.
**Jdawson**: Good.
**Bclymer**: How are you?
**Jdawson**: Good.
**Jdawson**: Does they turn your camera on, will you?
**Jdawson**: Unless you are naked.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: There you go, man.
**Jdawson**: I was nervous and excited for a moment there.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: Hope everybody had a good Memorial Day weekend.
**Jdawson**: So Jose, I see you talking with Ashley about the reconciliation and acumatica.
**Jdawson**: How is that coming?
**Jdawson**: Where you at on that?
**Justin**: Well, I have two pending steps to complete.
**Justin**: For example, the first one is to download the statement in different format in different format than PDF.
**Justin**: For example, she said ofx, I'm trying to download in that format from the bank from Capital One.
**Justin**: And that is the first one.
**Justin**: And the other one is we need to correct an issue we were talking about with Fatima related to one account that has been heated in akumatica different than Capital One.
**Justin**: But we are figuring out that to points.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So let's address one one thing at a time here.
**Jdawson**: So you said that you have in order to do the reconciliation in acumen.
**Jdawson**: So there, there is a way for it to automatically reconcile, correct?
**Justin**: Yes, correct.
**Jdawson**: And so you just have to download the transactions in Capital One in a different format.
**Justin**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Do you have access that you need in Capital One to be able to do that?
**Justin**: Yeah, I'm looking at to that statement in this moment and I found OFX format.
**Justin**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so you can do that and you can test that.
**Jdawson**: Great.
**Accounting**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Do you need anything from.
**Jdawson**: For me to help you do that?
**Fnjie**: Yeah, because he's asking for the application.
**Fnjie**: So he's asking me if we can convert the file to of fx, but we don't have that app.
**Fnjie**: How can we convert it?
**Jdawson**: Well, I thought you just said you could.
**Fnjie**: No, I don't.
**Fnjie**: I don't know.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Justin**: Okay, what is that?
**Justin**: OFX is in the auxiliary email that format.
**Justin**: But I am looking at Capital One and it's this.
**Justin**: Yeah, this has OFX format.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Justin**: And then I will download.
**Justin**: Yes, it does.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so try it and see if it looks.
**Bclymer**: I would say download it, send an example to Ashley and see if that's what she needs and then we can take it from there.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Should be able to do this in the test environment, correct?
**Justin**: No, I was trying to complete in life, but I haven't do that any this moment.
**Justin**: Just figure it out to get the information that we need.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Bclymer**: So if I may chime in, Brendan, the only issue I see with that is some of that we still have old transactions in notion from earlier in the year.
**Jdawson**: Okay, from what, what.
**Jdawson**: When you say earlier, that could be yesterday.
**Jdawson**: So is there a specific month or.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, right.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Now we had a meeting this morning and I told.
**Bclymer**: Told the team we need to reconcile all, all, all the credit card accounts all the way through, like April, whatever the due date is, whether it's the 1st, the 15th or whatever.
**Bclymer**: But we still have March transactions.
**Bclymer**: Some February.
**Jdawson**: I see, I see a bunch of March ones.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, let's see here.
**Jdawson**: So as far as February goes.
**Bclymer**: I think those were approved and Jose was working on importing them this morning.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I guess you have to send me the transactions you're talking about because I don't see any.
**Jdawson**: I don't see any for February.
**Jdawson**: All I see are March.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I, I think you already approved the February ones.
**Bclymer**: And he, he import.
**Bclymer**: He was working on importing.
**Bclymer**: Importing them.
**Bclymer**: So they, they must be already in the approved section.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so I'll go through and get March taken care of.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So in.
**Bclymer**: In order for us to reconcile or in order for the reconciliation to work, we need to get everything through the statement end in date.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: All right, so then I'll go through March and then.
**Jdawson**: So we're caught up through March, obviously February should be good.
**Jdawson**: If not, let me know.
**Jdawson**: So I will go through here and get all these coded here tonight and I'll reach out to anybody else.
**Jdawson**: It looks like most of these in March are mine, so I'll go through and if anybody doesn't have them, I will get them coded.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: What else?
**Bclymer**: I think so the second issue he was talking about there was some of the transactions got uploaded into the wrong card and it was the way it was set up, but it's really an easy fix.
**Bclymer**: We just need to credit it out of one account and put it in the next.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Bclymer**: No, no, no need to worry about that.
**Bclymer**: I have my team working on that and we should be able to get that by end of day today.
**Jdawson**: Okay, perfect.
**Jdawson**: Okay, that's good.
**Jdawson**: And then as far as.
**Jdawson**: Where are we at on.
**Jdawson**: See here, accounts payable and everything.
**Jdawson**: Fritzi is all that current and caught up to where it reads.
**Jdawson**: Like when I pull that report, it's going to read correctly.
**Jmendez**: Yeah.
**Jmendez**: So far, for the bills per checking, I have the on hold invoices, which was synced just today.
**Jmendez**: And then the retina issue that has been raised to job planner last week has been sorted out as well.
**Jmendez**: And then for the invoices in Notion, I still have some which I have just entered today.
**Jmendez**: And I still have AJ's.
**Jmendez**: I think AJ is not available today.
**Jdawson**: I'll just message him he's on vacation today.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Accounting**: I have a quest.
**Accounting**: Just a question.
**Accounting**: So when I go to the leadership dashboard, it says I have 74 transactions that aren't coded.
**Accounting**: But when I go to my transactions, things linked to my name, everything is coded in there.
**Accounting**: Like, where are these things that aren't coded?
**Accounting**: And maybe people just don't know how to get to them.
**Jdawson**: Let's take a gander here.
**Jdawson**: Sa.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so I'm looking here.
**Jdawson**: I see your 74 count.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: All right, so this.
**Jdawson**: All right, so what that is uploaded to Acumatica.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: All right, so all that is, is a glitch, it looks like.
**Jdawson**: So the status of all of yours is uploaded to Acumatica, Jesse.
**Jdawson**: And so that counter is just taking into account that number.
**Jdawson**: And so we just need to go in there and update that.
**Jdawson**: So let me share my screen here and show you.
**Jdawson**: When I look here, I went to accounting and I looked at all transactions, put in Jesse's name.
**Jdawson**: And so here's the status.
**Jdawson**: So uploaded to Acumatica is the status for all these.
**Jdawson**: It looks like there's 74 of them, as you can see, which is the same number.
**Jdawson**: So that's all that means.
**Jdawson**: So, Maria, if you can please go in here to this and you'll have to look at the back end and you need to go in and change the status that it reads to show that it is.
**Jdawson**: You need to only pull the ones that say imported.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And so that way it'll show only the ones that are.
**Jdawson**: That are not coded or anything like that.
**Jdawson**: And so all these numbers should change.
**Jdawson**: So you should be able to go in here to the back end and go to where it pulls, you know, sources, all that stuff.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: Okay, yeah, that'll take care of that.
**Accounting**: And then the ones that we're going to have to go in and approve, I guess going forward, we approve or like all the transactions that all the guys are making.
**Accounting**: So is that a different chart on here then?
**Accounting**: So we'll have.
**Accounting**: So how many they got?
**Accounting**: Plus we'll have how many are in our court.
**Jdawson**: So right here, this is.
**Jdawson**: This is.
**Jdawson**: This is showing that transactions not coded.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And then if you come down here.
**Jdawson**: Oops.
**Accounting**: Direct.
**Jdawson**: So right here, this is where we've got credit Card transactions to approve.
**Jdawson**: Once they change their status to coded, like AJ's here, then it kicks to this thing right here.
**Jdawson**: And so you can see.
**Jdawson**: So this is going to say everything that is coded is going to show right here in us.
**Jdawson**: And so then we look at this and say, okay, boom, boom, boom.
**Jdawson**: You know, looks good.
**Jdawson**: And so we say approved, and it drops off there.
**Jdawson**: And so then that kicks it over to accounting for them to upload.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Accounting**: And is this just an open line for everybody and we just go in and pick the ones we're going to approve?
**Jdawson**: No.
**Jdawson**: So only you and I have access to this leadership dashboard.
**Jdawson**: And so when you go to your leadership, when you go to this, only the ones that are approved will show up here.
**Accounting**: Right.
**Accounting**: I'm just asking, how do we want to split that up?
**Accounting**: Which ones do you want to look at?
**Accounting**: And which ones do you want me to look at?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I'd say.
**Jdawson**: I'd say for now.
**Jdawson**: I don't know.
**Jdawson**: I mean, I don't, you know, I don't have a.
**Accounting**: Or if we split it up now, Maria can create it.
**Accounting**: So it kicks them either to you or kicks them to me.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I would, you know, I would like to get to a point where we have layers right now.
**Jdawson**: You know, maybe with it just being us, you know, either one of us.
**Jdawson**: Either one of us can log in.
**Jdawson**: But I mean, as we get other people, you know, Jim and whatnot, then, you know, we.
**Jdawson**: And we actually start to have teams.
**Jdawson**: Then, you know, everybody, like, in this system, as we build out the org chart, everybody will have a manager.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Like, and so we'll start to build that out to where approvals go through to the.
**Jdawson**: Whoever the manager is on that project.
**Jdawson**: It's just like, you know, right now we're just trying to get something going.
**Jdawson**: And so, you know, because we.
**Jdawson**: We need to get to superintendents, do theirs, and it goes to project manager, you know, blah, blah, blah.
**Accounting**: Yeah, well, Maria is such a wiz at this.
**Accounting**: I thought she just click our fingers and it would happen.
**Fnjie**: Yeah, we can.
**Fnjie**: We can try to fix.
**Fnjie**: And for organizational chart that's already updated, but we need to create a column that.
**Fnjie**: It's called manager.
**Fnjie**: So we can refer them to that manager column and then, you know, be reflected on that as well.
**Fnjie**: Because right now we just have, you know, the basic information.
**Fnjie**: So.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, and that's what I was saying, you know, right now, I don't know how valuable that is.
**Jdawson**: I mean, there's only, what, you know, 16 of us, you know, but yes, we would need to get there at some point as we.
**Jdawson**: As we keep growing.
**Jdawson**: For now, I think just getting the system to work is priority, basically.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Hey, Maria, can you take a look at Glenn's card?
**Bclymer**: Because I know he's card wasn't attached to his name, so in the past I've had to go in and attach and assign it to him manually.
**Bclymer**: So can you look on the back end to see if it's automatically listed?
**Fnjie**: What's the.
**Fnjie**: What's the number?
**Jdawson**: She doesn't know.
**Jdawson**: That's what she's asking you to do.
**Fnjie**: Oh, I have no idea.
**Fnjie**: I can ask him.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I can tell you what the number is.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: So right here under organizational chart, this is where we'll need to go in.
**Jdawson**: So it looks like Glenn should be.8490.
**Jdawson**: Should be the last one.
**Jdawson**: If that's not populating or that's not correct, then we need to get.
**Fnjie**: Okay, sounds good.
**Fnjie**: Okay, let me check the.
**Jdawson**: I'll get Cabba's ordered.
**Jdawson**: Jax should be added.
**Jdawson**: Obviously it's not in here, which I don't know how that's working because Jack is right here.
**Jdawson**: I don't see Mike either, Maria, so let's obviously add him as well.
**Fnjie**: Yeah, I saw Kevin.
**Fnjie**: I saw Ian.
**Fnjie**: Wait, what is.
**Fnjie**: Unihan is not there either.
**Fnjie**: Ian is there.
**Fnjie**: It's just missing.
**Fnjie**: Why is Mike missing?
**Fnjie**: Okay, so.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, let's make sure we get that.
**Jdawson**: Updated cards.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: Co op.
**Accounting**: A credit card.
**Jdawson**: We do need to get in one.
**Accounting**: No, I said I hope we didn't.
**Jdawson**: No, we didn't.
**Jdawson**: Okay, what else do we have?
**Jdawson**: Anything else, Fatima, that's pressing?
**Bclymer**: No, other than your credit card number that I need.
**Bclymer**: I can get that from Maria offline, so I can get these filed.
**Bclymer**: But just to confirm, Alta Dallas is the only job in Texas, right?
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jmendez**: For the timesheet, can we use this spreadsheet instead so that I can allocate the payroll?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, if you want to shoot me that link, then I would go in there and process those.
**Jmendez**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: Don't forget to test, like Megan said, Fritzi, the timesheet because she couldn't post like the view that you wanted.
**Fnjie**: Exactly the same as the spreadsheet view.
**Fnjie**: But she said that regardless.
**Fnjie**: I mean, we can.
**Fnjie**: It's obviously going to be different from the spreadsheet, but it's going to show some of the things that you previously have.
**Fnjie**: So if you can go ahead and test it out and then, you know, that'll be easy for us as well to know if it's working.
**Fnjie**: She does.
**Fnjie**: She wants to also learn, I mean, understand if it's actually working for you, but for the view, it will be very difficult to have exactly the one you have on the spreadsheet.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: Okay, thank you.
**Jdawson**: And then, you know, Jose, like, I like what you're doing as far as, like, going in, asking the questions, figuring out the stuff for how to reconcile.
**Jdawson**: That's what I want you guys to do, is like, what we need to do as we keep growing is every single thing that we think of that we do.
**Jdawson**: Because especially accounting, everything is repetitive.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And we need to constantly think about automation, Automation, automation.
**Jdawson**: How can we automate something that we're repeatedly doing every month?
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: And so then that's going to help because as we grow, instead of us having 10 different accountants, you guys can just be here running everything, which in turn is going to help the company prosper.
**Jdawson**: Everybody wins, you know, everybody makes more money.
**Jdawson**: We have more overhead.
**Jdawson**: It is a win win.
**Jdawson**: You save time.
**Jdawson**: Because at the end of the day, like, I don't actually care how much anybody works.
**Jdawson**: Like, I could care less.
**Jdawson**: Like, we don't track anybody's screens.
**Jdawson**: We don't do any of that.
**Jdawson**: What I care about and what Jesse cares about is getting things done.
**Jdawson**: Right?
**Jdawson**: And so that's.
**Jdawson**: We're in the business of getting things done, like, not sitting there doing it.
**Jdawson**: So the more that you guys can think and automate to make your lives easier, the better.
**Justin**: Okay, thank you.
**Justin**: Makes sense.
**Bclymer**: Just don't, don't fire us.
**Jdawson**: Do what?
**Bclymer**: Just, just don't fire us.
**Jdawson**: I mean, I don't want to fire anybody, especially as we keep growing.
**Jdawson**: If you guys are solving problems and getting things done, then that's where it's at.
**Jdawson**: Like, they've got no reason to.
**Jdawson**: Do you guys have any questions for me or Jesse?
**Bclymer**: Is there anything we, I mean, is there anything we can do to help, you know, the, the project teams?
**Bclymer**: Because I noticed that now we, I guess unless, you know, we are getting less and less emails about errors and stuff.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I mean, staying on top of the error, you know, that's the biggest thing.
**Jdawson**: And the, you know, whatever syncing issues, getting those, like, fixed is as quickly as possible so it's correct.
**Jdawson**: Especially when you think about, like, I don't know if we have a, an accounting calendar built yet.
**Jdawson**: If not, let's build one so that we know it's like, hey, like, we know that sub bills are going to be done by the, the 25th, the 28th.
**Jdawson**: Let's just say the 28th of the month.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: And then by the 30th, we should have all of our owner billings in.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And then that means PSRS project status reports are due.
**Jdawson**: What day, Jesse, is it the fifth of the polling month?
**Accounting**: Yeah, no later than the fifth.
**Accounting**: And like, I'm accustomed to the accounting team driving owner billings, like my accountant would call me, like, your.
**Accounting**: Your draft billings due on this date.
**Accounting**: You know, so we need to set up like he's.
**Accounting**: Brandon said that accounting calendar by the 25th.
**Accounting**: Typically we should have all owner billings done.
**Accounting**: So, you know, whoever the PM is assigned to that, if you don't see that invoice come through to you or hasn't been created, then you need to reach out to them and tell them, hey, we're missing this billing.
**Accounting**: And then, you know, whatever our payment terms are from the owner, you, like, notify us if we haven't received payment by that date.
**Accounting**: Because, like, we all got so much going on that, you know, I don't know who's paid us or hasn't paid us.
**Accounting**: And I mean, it'd be helpful if you guys could lead that up and send out the notifications when you're not seeing the billings and they're not getting turned in on time or paid.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So, Jesse, on that, I think I would like to schedule a meeting with you just so we can kind of go, go, go over all those things and start doing that moving forward.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And so looking at this, you know, accounting tracking issue, so couple things, so your person responsible, right?
**Jdawson**: This should never be blank.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And it probably shouldn't have me listed as responsible for something.
**Jdawson**: If it does that, that's bad.
**Jdawson**: You know, these are things that you guys should be able to handle.
**Jdawson**: If I have to get in there and handle that, that's a problem.
**Jdawson**: And then, you know, I don't know what I guess this is, you know, status or in progress versus completed.
**Jdawson**: This one's blank.
**Jdawson**: I don't know why that is.
**Jdawson**: And then we should all have.
**Jdawson**: It should all have a due date, right?
**Jdawson**: Like, when is this going to be due?
**Jdawson**: What are we tracking on?
**Jdawson**: Like, we should definitely have this filled out, otherwise it does no real good.
**Jdawson**: Like, looking at this, it's, it's.
**Jdawson**: It's very incomplete.
**Jdawson**: Don't really know what's going on.
**Jdawson**: Um, you know, and so, like, this one, as you're tracking stuff, again, similar to like, how we, how we track other projects.
**Jdawson**: Maria, this should be much cleaner to see you actually.
**Jdawson**: What's going on?
**Jdawson**: Like, I should be able to.
**Jdawson**: To quickly See, like, what the actual title of it is.
**Jdawson**: Like, oh, okay, this is blah.
**Jdawson**: This is blah.
**Jdawson**: This is blah.
**Jdawson**: Like, and then I can click into it and see what the issues are, and it tells the story if we need to.
**Jdawson**: But right now, this is pretty sloppy.
**Jdawson**: You guys understand what I'm talking about?
**Fnjie**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So, yeah, Maria, if you can work with, you know, Fritzi and Jose and get this cleaned up to where, you know, we actually are tracking, like, you know, again, like, it's as simple as, like, every time we get a sync error or, like, oh, we've got the default project task showed up on blah, like, every single thing.
**Jdawson**: And then we could say, here's what happened.
**Jdawson**: The data happened.
**Jdawson**: It's planned to be resolved, or the date it is resolved.
**Jdawson**: And then we can close it, and then it drops off here.
**Jdawson**: But that way we have an actual ticket of all these issues that we keep running into.
**Jdawson**: Because what I can do is then I can look and say, hey, job planner, look at all these issues that we've had in the past six months with you guys that I have to commit resources to.
**Jdawson**: To fix, you know, and then I can.
**Jdawson**: That helps me in my negotiating power.
**Jdawson**: It also helps us tracking so things don't get lost.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so this is.
**Jdawson**: This is a tool more for you guys than it is for me or Jesse to come in and check on it.
**Jdawson**: Right?
**Jdawson**: Like, that's.
**Jdawson**: This is a reminder so you guys don't get lost so that I.
**Jdawson**: I don't have to sit there and constant say, where are we at on this?
**Jdawson**: Where are we at on this?
**Jdawson**: Where are we on this?
**Jdawson**: You guys are tracking it, getting it done, and then that just builds more and more trust for you guys to work autonomously, and Jesse and I are more just getting updates and saying how good you're doing.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Any other questions?
**Jdawson**: Awesome.
**Jdawson**: Thanks, everybody.
**Bclymer**: All right, thank you.
**Jdawson**: Bye.
**Fnjie**: Thank you.
**Fnjie**: Bye.
