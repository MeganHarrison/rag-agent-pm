## Transcript
**Awoodhams**: Or.
**Awoodhams**: Sorry to interrupt.
**Awoodhams**: I would.
**Awoodhams**: I would wait up for Brennan.
**Awoodhams**: He's be the manager of the project.
**Awoodhams**: I'm.
**Awoodhams**: I'm just doing the engineering.
**Brhoades**: Okay.
**Brhoades**: Part of it.
**Brhoades**: All right, perfect.
**Brhoades**: So you're working on the permit drawings, correct?
**Awoodhams**: Yeah.
**Brhoades**: Okay.
**Brhoades**: How are we making out with those?
**Brhoades**: I know you got them late last week, I think, or at least the cad.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah, we're making progress.
**Awoodhams**: So.
**Brhoades**: Okay.
**Awoodhams**: No questions yet.
**Brhoades**: Any ETA or estimated time that you guys will be done with that?
**Awoodhams**: I think we're trying to be done by the end of the week.
**Awoodhams**: There is a lot there, though, so we'll.
**Brhoades**: Yeah, we're.
**Awoodhams**: We're going as fast as we can on it.
**Brhoades**: Gotcha.
**Awoodhams**: I think Brennan was on this meeting, right?
**Brhoades**: Yes, he.
**Kmass**: Yeah, he.
**Awoodhams**: I think he accepted.
**Brhoades**: Okay, Sam.
**Awoodhams**: All right, I think we're good to go now.
**Brhoades**: How you doing, Brendan?
**Kmass**: Hey.
**Kmass**: Good.
**Kmass**: How are you guys?
**Brhoades**: Not too bad for Monday.
**Brhoades**: All right, so got Kev on here.
**Brhoades**: He's obviously going to be the project manager for these.
**Brhoades**: I'll be jumping as in a superintendent, but we're hoping we could jump on here quick, go over the schedule, try to throw some dates at it.
**Brhoades**: I know radio was looking for something by end of day, so we'll get them.
**Brhoades**: Somewhat of a tentative schedule with what we got so far.
**Brhoades**: I know.
**Brhoades**: I was just talking to Alex and there's a lot on those permit drawings and they're working through those currently.
**Brhoades**: He said possibly by Friday you'll be able to get those finished up.
**Brhoades**: That's.
**Awoodhams**: That's best case scenario, so.
**Brhoades**: Okay.
**Awoodhams**: More likely next week, but that.
**Awoodhams**: That's what we're doing, aiming for, so.
**Brhoades**: Okay.
**Brhoades**: All right.
**Brhoades**: Trevor, do you got anything or you want me jump in the schedule?
**Speaker 3**: You can jump in right now.
**Brhoades**: Okay.
**Brhoades**: All right, you guys can see my screen over here.
**Brhoades**: Yes.
**Brhoades**: All right, so just want to throw some dates to this stuff.
**Brhoades**: Approved permit drawing or playing, obviously we're working on that.
**Brhoades**: Spoke to Brendan last week briefly about getting some guys out there for this coming Wednesday, the 11th, I believe it is.
**Brhoades**: Yep.
**Brhoades**: So are we still good for the 11th to get some guys out there just to kind of look at what we got going on and possibly get some of the demo and other things done.
**Kmass**: Yeah, we're.
**Kmass**: I think we're gonna be able to shift things around and make something happen.
**Brhoades**: Okay, I appreciate that.
**Brhoades**: Now I kind of followed up with an email just requesting that.
**Brhoades**: We had two.
**Brhoades**: Two guys on site.
**Brhoades**: They're gonna have a bunch of executives running around over there starting Wednesday and their main guy over There JP is really admin about having at least two guys over there doing some stuff to make it, well, not look like we are moving, but to show things are moving along.
**Brhoades**: So if we could just try to get two guys over there, that would be great.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Brhoades**: All right, so first things first.
**Brhoades**: They're.
**Brhoades**: They're really trying to get this whole thing up and running on 7:14.
**Brhoades**: Now that really only has to do with a lot of the quad drops and the workstation receptacles and that kind of scope of work.
**Brhoades**: But obviously we have time to obviously work in a lot of this overhead door work, and we want to add that in as well.
**Brhoades**: So.
**Brhoades**: So what I got from basically the scope of work is there is about 12 drops that we got to get in.
**Brhoades**: So if you guys.
**Brhoades**: I think you guys said around the 16th, you guys will somewhat be fully mobilized with guys on site going after this stuff.
**Brhoades**: Right.
**Kmass**: Where's the.
**Kmass**: The 12 drops?
**Kmass**: I mean, hell, the one I read was like way, way more than that.
**Brhoades**: Oh, there's a lot more.
**Kmass**: Yeah.
**Kmass**: Alex, do you have in front of me?
**Kmass**: But it was like.
**Kmass**: It was like a hundred.
**Brhoades**: Well, I.
**Brhoades**: I have 98 workstations, so I guess that that would possibly be what we're talking about.
**Brhoades**: Same thing.
**Awoodhams**: Okay, so what are the quad drops versus the workstations?
**Awoodhams**: Like, what's.
**Awoodhams**: What's the 12 quad drops?
**Awoodhams**: Why.
**Awoodhams**: Why are those not part of the workstations?
**Brhoades**: Yeah, I guess what we should do is just combine this all into one.
**Brhoades**: So line item 20 and 21 we can just put together as the same thing.
**Brhoades**: Okay.
**Brhoades**: All right, so if you guys start that, I don't know when you're thinking, you get in there Wednesday, you take those two days to kind of look at everything, trace circuits, get stuff laid out, and then the 16th, we start going after that, the main work area stuff.
**Brhoades**: When you guys thinking you could have that wrapped up, knowing that we got to have all this pretty much done by the 14th.
**Kmass**: It's going to take the whole time.
**Brhoades**: Okay.
**Kmass**: It'Ll take.
**Kmass**: It's a month worth of work to do.
**Brhoades**: So I can just put you down for 14th.
**Brhoades**: Yeah, 21 days.
**Brhoades**: So I'll put you here the same.
**Brhoades**: And then this 60amp feed being relocated.
**Kmass**: That I guess will depend on when are they scheduling their shutdown of the conveyor control panel.
**Brhoades**: Just merit in your note, would you.
**Brhoades**: Would you want to try to go after that work towards the end, middle or beginning time in between these, these dates here?
**Kmass**: Well, I guess, I mean, the, the.
**Kmass**: We could install the new Feeder at any time, essentially, but, you know, the remainder of it.
**Kmass**: I guess we need to figure out what their.
**Kmass**: What their timeline or are they just letting us choose?
**Brhoades**: Yeah, I think it pretty much at this point we say, hey, look, this is the date we're trying to go after this relocation of the.
**Brhoades**: The 60amp feed.
**Brhoades**: And then they make it happen unless we hear different.
**Brhoades**: So like I said, I'll first we'll present this schedule to them today and then they'll come back with some comments, say, hey, look, this isn't going to work, or that will.
**Brhoades**: And then kind of go from there.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Kmass**: I would say a couple weekends from now would be best to tackle that.
**Kmass**: We probably need some time to get the right crew and get it all figured out.
**Brhoades**: Gotcha.
**Brhoades**: So let's put you down for like the 30th.
**Brhoades**: How many days roughly you think.
**Kmass**: For the new feeder?
**Kmass**: Yeah, I would say three.
**Brhoades**: Disconnect details.
**Brhoades**: Okay, so dock levelers.
**Brhoades**: So basically running power to each of the dock door locations.
**Brhoades**: There's a couple different things broken down in here that we need power to.
**Kmass**: Is now.
**Kmass**: Does all that need to be done by the same date?
**Brhoades**: Now, Kendall, correct me if I'm wrong, I don't believe it has to be done on this 714 date.
**Speaker 3**: Right.
**Speaker 3**: I don't think they have to be done in the same day.
**Speaker 3**: So they need to think about this.
**Speaker 3**: If we are maybe putting all the dose up and then put the bring power to them, or maybe after they cut the doors out, we have them put power and then the doors can come in so it can all run out when they're done.
**Brhoades**: Do you guys have a preference?
**Brhoades**: Do you guys rather have the doors installed and all the levelers and all that?
**Kmass**: Yeah, I was gonna say, I think somebody told me that your target date for that was like September.
**Brhoades**: Yet.
**Brhoades**: 9:15.
**Brhoades**: I think we have door completion.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Brhoades**: We got.
**Brhoades**: We got some time.
**Brhoades**: But I figured since we got you on site here up until, you know, the 7:14, you guys plan on just rolling right into that obviously, right?
**Kmass**: Yeah, yeah, we probably would.
**Brhoades**: Okay, so if we start this stuff, that kind of separates Doc.
**Brhoades**: So are you guys willing to at least start running some of your.
**Brhoades**: Your lines to the individual doors since there's 30 of them?
**Brhoades**: Obviously all the doors and stuff won't be in by, you know, the 14th.
**Brhoades**: So.
**Kmass**: Yeah, I mean, we.
**Kmass**: We could work on some of that if we.
**Kmass**: If we get the drops done first.
**Kmass**: It kind of depends on how much manpower I get.
**Brhoades**: Yeah.
**Brhoades**: Knowing that we definitely got to go after these first that just having the workstations and have all that stuff up and running by the 14th because they want to commission everything and go live on the 21st.
**Brhoades**: So as long as we have the workstations and everything they need in that those areas done, we should be all right.
**Kmass**: Yeah.
**Kmass**: I would put us down for.
**Kmass**: For starting on the Doctors after the 14th.
**Brhoades**: Okay.
**Brhoades**: We'll just roll into that.
**Brhoades**: And then I mean just roughly day wise, what are you thinking for each of these?
**Brhoades**: I mean there's 30 of them.
**Brhoades**: It's going to be all over the place.
**Kmass**: Yeah, I would, I would put.
**Kmass**: It's going to be I just.
**Kmass**: 30 days.
**Kmass**: It probably won't take 30 days, but.
**Brhoades**: Right.
**Brhoades**: Just put it down 25.
**Brhoades**: Okay.
**Brhoades**: So you think that those 30 days you're.
**Brhoades**: You're combining all this stuff in you.
**Kmass**: Yes.
**Brhoades**: Okay.
**Brhoades**: So.
**Brhoades**: Yeah.
**Brhoades**: Levelers are already part of the doors, the door.
**Brhoades**: Restraints, fans, lights or restraints, green lights, receptacles, some.
**Brhoades**: Then they got some chargers going in there.
**Brhoades**: 30 different chargers.
**Kmass**: Yeah, that would.
**Kmass**: That's going to take.
**Kmass**: I mean, when do those need to be done by.
**Brhoades**: I think by the.
**Brhoades**: The 8, 9, 15.
**Kmass**: The Chargers as well.
**Brhoades**: Yeah.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Kmass**: Yeah, I mean all of this, all that work is gonna probably take place simultaneously after the.
**Kmass**: After the 14th.
**Brhoades**: Okay.
**Brhoades**: So Chargers may be a little bit towards the end.
**Brhoades**: So maybe I'll put you down for like maybe the 28th.
**Kmass**: Yeah.
**Brhoades**: And then that will just run out to 825.
**Brhoades**: Or.
**Kmass**: I would put the chargers down for a month as well.
**Brhoades**: Okay.
**Brhoades**: Well knowing we got to be out of there by 9:15, so we'll just arrange it to be way too big.
**Brhoades**: I'll back this off a few.
**Speaker 3**: So that would include the exterior charges, I assume as well.
**Brhoades**: Yeah.
**Brhoades**: That these are.
**Brhoades**: Yeah.
**Brhoades**: Exterior chargers.
**Brhoades**: Can we join those in with the pit chargers too?
**Kmass**: Yeah.
**Brhoades**: Okay, so you're going after those around the same time.
**Brhoades**: Yeah, all you there.
**Brhoades**: Okay, that should be pretty good for that.
**Brhoades**: Now, are you both on the Martinsville job?
**Kmass**: I've been looking at it.
**Kmass**: I need to get the generator, the size of the generator, which I may have now.
**Kmass**: I just got an email.
**Brhoades**: Yeah, I have some photos, but unfortunately the photos don't show the.
**Brhoades**: The main breaker size coming into it.
**Brhoades**: I got some individual photos of a panel and stuff, but not the actual main breaker isn't in it.
**Kmass**: Yeah, I'll look through that stuff and see what.
**Kmass**: See if I can figure that out.
**Brhoades**: Okay.
**Brhoades**: Yeah.
**Brhoades**: So just so you know, they're looking for that to be done around the 8:15 as well, out there.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Brhoades**: Unless I remember, I think Jesse was saying you're trying to get somebody out there to take a look at that.
**Brhoades**: I don't know if you guys were able to the other day.
**Brhoades**: I don't think so.
**Kmass**: No, we weren't.
**Brhoades**: Okay, so with kind of what you see here.
**Brhoades**: Well, you, I guess.
**Brhoades**: What do you think of ballpark wise?
**Brhoades**: Do we have a start date for Martinsville?
**Brhoades**: Kind of.
**Brhoades**: It's whenever we can get in there, right?
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, yeah.
**Speaker 3**: They have not sent us any definitive dates yet.
**Brhoades**: Yeah, they just know they want us to be done by 8:15 on this Martinsville one.
**Kmass**: Yeah, that one.
**Kmass**: I.
**Kmass**: I'm still trying to dig in and figure out how much work it really is.
**Kmass**: Yeah, I probably need some more time to get that dialed in first.
**Brhoades**: Okay.
**Brhoades**: Before you give us dates.
**Brhoades**: Yeah, okay, that's not a problem.
**Brhoades**: Okay, sounds good.
**Brhoades**: So what I'll do is I'll probably just reach out to you maybe tomorrow, Brennan, and see.
**Brhoades**: Doesn't give you much time to look into Martinsville, but just touch basically to see where you're at with it because I know they'll be hounding us for this schedule, but I'll just let them know, hey, look, it was kind of last minute.
**Brhoades**: We need a few days just to kind of look at the scope and figure that out.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Brhoades**: All right.
**Brhoades**: Kevin, do you need anything?
**Brhoades**: Got anything?
**Speaker 3**: No.
**Speaker 3**: So for these two projects, have you guys sent us pricing yet or.
**Speaker 3**: Or are we going to do as.
**Speaker 3**: I think someone messaged through the emails, time and material as we go.
**Kmass**: Well, we were going to start the Avon one that way just because of how quick they needed us to start.
**Kmass**: But yeah, no, I'm trying to put together a price for both of these so you guys will have a solid number.
**Speaker 3**: Okay.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: So I guess as soon as you get pricing over, we can can proceed to write a contract or for the Avon one, maybe put a pay.
**Kmass**: Yeah, I got sent out requests for quotes on breakers for the battery charger panels, breakers to go in the switch gears and hopefully I'll have that stuff back.
**Speaker 3**: Okay.
**Kmass**: Either today or tomorrow and then I can start getting that thing finalized.
**Speaker 3**: All right, sounds good.
**Brhoades**: Sounds like we need a good, you know, three, four days to kind of really get this thing moving in.
**Brhoades**: In the right direction.
**Brhoades**: So hopefully they'll cool off a little bit.
**Brhoades**: But as long as I think we get a couple guys in there Wednesday like you said you would, I think we'll be in pretty good shape.
**Kmass**: Okay, sounds good.
**Brhoades**: Show some face and then we'll just keep working through it, all right?
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Kmass**: Yep.
**Brhoades**: All right, fellas, I appreciate your time, and we'll be in touch.
**Brhoades**: Alex, you got anything?
**Brhoades**: Are you good?
**Awoodhams**: No, I'm good.
**Brhoades**: Okay.
**Brhoades**: Alrighty, guys.
**Speaker 3**: Thank you.
**Brhoades**: Guys.
**Brhoades**: Reach out to you.
