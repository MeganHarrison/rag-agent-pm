## Transcript
**Bclymer**: We got to keep it clean.
**Jdawson**: Speak no speak no equal.
**Jremillard**: I'll just keep my mouth shut.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I just won't say anything.
**Bclymer**: I just actually was in the sk.
**Bclymer**: In the estimate, just throwing some plug numbers in there.
**Bclymer**: I don't know how much you're do.
**Bclymer**: Everything guy was taken on.
**Jremillard**: He's going through that with me today.
**Jremillard**: And I have about a dozen other people that I need to issue these drawings to.
**Jremillard**: So we can try to keep it at three bids of scope.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: And capture everything.
**Bclymer**: So if you forward them to Andrew, then he can send out it fill out for you?
**Jdawson**: Absolutely.
**Jremillard**: Okay.

**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: I just got a bunch of, yeah, I got a bunch of phone contacts.
**Jremillard**: I'll just start sending them to you.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, when you were texting like that, that worked perfect.
**Bclymer**: Perfect.
**Jremillard**: I talked to Bill.
**Jremillard**: He was like, hey, are you guys gonna have that number today?
**Jremillard**: I told him yeah, to be late tonight.
**Jremillard**: Did I lie to him?
**Bclymer**: I think we can.
**Bclymer**: We just got to look through this Jesse, and see what, what you have.
**Bclymer**: And then we'll plug in some stuff for these others.
**Bclymer**: But did the electrician.
**Jremillard**: Do we at least have the MEPs?
**Jremillard**: Yeah, we got plumbing, I'm trying to get H vac and then electrical.
**Jremillard**: I'm going to be talking to the guys this afternoon.
**Jremillard**: So my first block of time open today is 1 to 1:30.
**Jremillard**: So I don't have much time to call people in today before business hours end out here.
**Jremillard**: But I'm going to use all the time I can to do it.
**Jremillard**: Okay, well, I mean if you, you know, if we've got those contacts like you know, Andrew or whoever, you know, one of us can, can call them.
**Jremillard**: I just.
**Jremillard**: Okay, if we're not gonna have a number, I, I want to be able to be like, you know, let him know now and not tell him at 8:00.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: So just let, let me know.
**Jremillard**: I'll let you guys get back to it, but just let me know kind of where we land.
**Bclymer**: Okay, I'll give you a call afterwards.
**Jremillard**: Thanks.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: Andrew, if you're not sure what these, any of these guys do, just let me know.
**Jremillard**: I'll try to get all the stuff in.
**Bclymer**: Andrew, did you leave us?
**Jremillard**: Oh yeah.
**Jremillard**: He's gone.
**Bclymer**: Just like that, Andrew was gone.
**Jremillard**: Oh God.
**Jremillard**: Today is insane.
**Bclymer**: Really?
**Bclymer**: What do you, what do you what are your meetings about?
**Jremillard**: People just don't understand anything.
**Jremillard**: So.
**Jremillard**: And with yesterday being a holiday, everybody rescheduled to today.
**Jremillard**: So I've been on the phone since early this morning explaining simple things to people, forwarding them emails.
**Jremillard**: I've already sent them the usual.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, that's annoying.
**Bclymer**: All right, so let's see.
**Jremillard**: I'm firing these off.
**Jremillard**: What's that?
**Bclymer**: Okay, I was just gonna share my screen.
**Bclymer**: So if.
**Bclymer**: If we run through these, Jesse, then we can honestly, we get.
**Bclymer**: Get through this, get off of here.
**Bclymer**: And then we can just split this up.
**Bclymer**: I'm going to put notes out here like, who of us is doing what?
**Jremillard**: Are you sharing your screen?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I think so.
**Jremillard**: All my shit's white.
**Jremillard**: Like, your screen's white.
**Jremillard**: The shared screen's white.
**Jremillard**: Let me leave and come back real quick.
**Bclymer**: Let me try it one more time.
**Bclymer**: I'll reshare this.
**Bclymer**: You see it now?
**Bclymer**: I mean, it's the Excel sheet, so it's kind of white.
**Jremillard**: No, it's like just flat blank white.
**Bclymer**: Oh, shit.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, your little screen has been that way too.
**Jremillard**: But I'll leave and come right back.
**Bclymer**: Andrew, can you see it?
**Jremillard**: Oh, I made it.
**Jremillard**: All right.
**Bclymer**: See, is the screen still white?
**Jremillard**: No, I can see you in the camera now.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: It took me forever to log back in.
**Jremillard**: It kept just loading.
**Bclymer**: Huh.
**Bclymer**: It's weird.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Andrews have troubles too.
**Bclymer**: I don't know what the going on there.
**Jremillard**: I just shot him all those contacts.
**Bclymer**: Okay, very good.
**Jremillard**: And then I gotta hit the yellow pages for some more odds and ends installers.
**Jremillard**: Okay, now I can see your screen.
**Bclymer**: All right, excellent.
**Bclymer**: All right, so here.
**Jremillard**: And I didn't put that engineer in there yet, one Spencer, but I did put WN in here.
**Bclymer**: All right, so like here, the electrician, we're just going to plug a number.
**Bclymer**: We'll say It'll cost some 3,000 bucks, demo those existing charges.
**Bclymer**: Just some unistrut and plugs.
**Bclymer**: You said that.
**Bclymer**: Did you get the revised quote with the concrete included?
**Jremillard**: I haven't gotten the revisions, but they're.
**Jremillard**: All three of them are going to include it and send it.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Were they thinking they could get you something today or did they say, I'll.
**Jremillard**: Circle back with them?
**Jremillard**: They said they were going to call and add it, so that the way I took it was they were just going to send it right over.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: But I'll make the rounds.
**Bclymer**: 33.
**Bclymer**: Okay, figure 5 and 5 demo lights will be in the electrical number.
**Bclymer**: So saw like concrete cutting of that new entry door.
**Bclymer**: Come in and cut it Demo it.
**Bclymer**: The concrete's in the plumbing number.
**Jremillard**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Lasers.
**Bclymer**: 51 new docs, I think.
**Jremillard**: 56, isn't it 56.
**Jremillard**: See, I got the sheets right here.
**Bclymer**: The.
**Jremillard**: Oh, here it is.
**Jremillard**: 56 new pit levelers.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: That one dock equipment guy is supposed to give us a railing number, but a typical metal railing, you can get that supplied installed for like 200.
**Bclymer**: It's just a railing.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: And I did just send Andrew a metal railing guy.
**Jremillard**: So between him, the odds and ends guy and the dock guys that are doing it, we should have plenty of numbers.
**Jremillard**: The two that I wanted to get some additional on was H VAC and electrical.
**Jremillard**: And then I threw in some plumbing and stuff.
**Jremillard**: But I don't want to leave any holes that we're wondering where the fuck are the numbers on next Friday when we have hard bids coming in.
**Bclymer**: Exactly.
**Bclymer**: So we had 880ft of guardrail.
**Jremillard**: This one says 1034.
**Bclymer**: Which plan?
**Jremillard**: I'm looking at that addendum dock plan.
**Jremillard**: The lower left corner where it's got all those call outs for the mechanical requirements.
**Bclymer**: I was looking at the old 880 before they did add 1034.
**Bclymer**: We have.
**Jremillard**: So the phases that you wrote down when we met there.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: Is that the start date?
**Jremillard**: And each phase is three months.
**Jremillard**: So that September start date is actually going to complete around Christmas.
**Bclymer**: Grab my plan here.
**Bclymer**: So they showed phase one of the racking being in 15.
**Bclymer**: Then the second phase by 10:20, the other by 11:17.
**Bclymer**: So that's just the racking, so.
**Jremillard**: Oh, so they're not even starting the racking till September?
**Jremillard**: I thought they were starting it in July.
**Bclymer**: No, they're finished with the first.
**Bclymer**: That they split it up into three.
**Bclymer**: Three areas.
**Jremillard**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: So the first one is done by 9:15 starting July 15th.
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: The second one is by 10:20, second section and the third by 11:17.
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: So that's kind of our.
**Jremillard**: 11:17 is our kind of completion.
**Jremillard**: Unless we do that change order transformer work.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Try to pinch everything but that.
**Bclymer**: And then ballers for risers are 11.
**Bclymer**: You have nine sets of seven.
**Bclymer**: One set three, one set four, one riser.
**Bclymer**: A weird quantity because our old quantities were.
**Bclymer**: See here.
**Jremillard**: So the one set of three must be one, and that's along a straight wall.
**Bclymer**: Man.
**Bclymer**: You made these.
**Bclymer**: You called them the current set.
**Bclymer**: Andrew.
**Bclymer**: Existing building drawings.
**Bclymer**: DD 1, 2, 6.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so DD 1, $78.
**Bclymer**: But 9 times 7 plus 3 plus 4 plus 1 equals 3 plus 3 plus 71.
**Bclymer**: So let's go 78.
**Bclymer**: That was our initial one.
**Bclymer**: Twelve hundred a piece.
**Bclymer**: See?
**Bclymer**: Six hundred.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Plywood.
**Bclymer**: That's nothing.
**Bclymer**: Thousand bucks.
**Bclymer**: Specialties, six bathrooms and the H vac you thought you were going to get the quote on.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, I should be getting three of them.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Double entrant.
**Bclymer**: Thor's Panic Hardware.
**Bclymer**: It's going to be right.
**Bclymer**: Save 4,500 interior doors.
**Bclymer**: A quick count of those, then your.
**Bclymer**: So Andrew will plug some numbers in here for doors.
**Bclymer**: Your drywaller.
**Bclymer**: Has he got back to you, Jesse, on what he's thinking?
**Jremillard**: No, I'm gonna circle back with Fred Dahl this afternoon.
**Jremillard**: And then I just got another drywaller that I sent Andrew.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: We'll plug numbers.
**Bclymer**: Go ahead.
**Bclymer**: Oh, yeah.
**Bclymer**: We'll plug numbers in for the flooring base, the tile, ceilings, painter.
**Bclymer**: We can plug all those in.
**Bclymer**: J and A.
**Bclymer**: Andrew, you're froze up.
**Bclymer**: Or else you're real focused.
**Jremillard**: It's very still.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: This would be.
**Jremillard**: Is JNA a contractor?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, Jesse and Andrew.
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: JD and A.
**Bclymer**: Better.
**Bclymer**: We'll plug all them in.
**Bclymer**: Your roofer you thought was going to get back to you?
**Bclymer**: I think.
**Jremillard**: He wants to go there.
**Jremillard**: And then last night I sent him the existing drawings.
**Jremillard**: So he should have enough with those existing drawings to be able to just get pricing on roofing.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: It's like we're in Dallas.
**Bclymer**: Your junior.
**Jremillard**: Jharu wing.
**Bclymer**: That's right.
**Bclymer**: Signage.
**Bclymer**: I plugged that in.
**Bclymer**: Toilet accessories plug.
**Bclymer**: Two grand a bathroom.
**Bclymer**: Six bathrooms for bathroom partitions.
**Bclymer**: And then lockers.
**Bclymer**: There's 636 total of them.
**Bclymer**: I figured.
**Bclymer**: Andrew, we can't hear you.
**Bclymer**: You're muted.
**Bclymer**: Tell you you're cussing someone out.
**Bclymer**: So 75 bucks a locker, I think is about average.
**Jremillard**: Is that the employee lockers?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, but Andrew in there, if it's wrong, I'll just blame it on him.
**Bclymer**: So we should get a number on the equipment.
**Bclymer**: So the bay, like the wall cabinets, I can plug numbers for that.
**Bclymer**: Unless.
**Bclymer**: Then again, if you can get your little.
**Bclymer**: You're not little, but the guy that is going to look at everything, then we can come back in and change him if we get it in time.
**Jremillard**: I just had another guy, H Vac guy, email and ask about a walk.
**Jremillard**: Do you know anyone besides Hermes that could try to set that up for next week?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, Brandon said we'll get with.
**Bclymer**: Bill is the guy we deal with at radio all the time and we can set something up.
**Bclymer**: Get somebody else in.
**Jdawson**: I'm here.
**Jdawson**: That was Christian I was on the phone with from Minor.
**Jdawson**: So the people that are in that chain, like they don't do any of the estimating is what he was telling me.
**Jdawson**: Or any of the.
**Jdawson**: They wouldn't be able to provide us with a number.
**Jdawson**: So this Christian guy is sending an email to is either Kayla or Caleb.
**Jdawson**: And Caleb then assigns the job to someone.
**Jdawson**: But they're not gonna.
**Jdawson**: They can't get us a number for most likely two weeks is what he's saying.
**Bclymer**: And they must have some antiquated system because that one guy got his price the next day.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I, I told him.
**Jdawson**: I was like, hey, like we know how many we need.
**Jdawson**: Like it's like 60.
**Jdawson**: 60 doors, like, or dock stations.
**Jdawson**: Like can you, can you provide a price for like per station or per area?
**Jdawson**: And he's like, we can, but it's not that simple.
**Jdawson**: We still got to go to all of our vendors.
**Jdawson**: And so.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And they still want to look at the specs, which all the specs are.
**Bclymer**: In.
**Jdawson**: The word document.
**Jdawson**: Correct.
**Bclymer**: Well, they can provide whatever.
**Bclymer**: Like.
**Bclymer**: And that's what.
**Bclymer**: When I first talked to that guy, he told me, oh, we got these in stock and we know what Amazon uses, so we'll just spec that.
**Bclymer**: The guy, Freddie.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: I don't know what's going on with these other guys, but.
**Jremillard**: He'S from.
**Bclymer**: It's just cost effective.
**Jremillard**: Keith from Access just got back to me.
**Jremillard**: He said his budget number for MEP design from his engineers is 500k and he wants me to call him after this meeting to pull up the drawings to talk about his lighting budget number.
**Bclymer**: 500,000 just to engineer it?
**Jremillard**: Yep.
**Jremillard**: The design fee from the engineer for the MEPs, he said is 500.
**Bclymer**: That's insane.
**Jremillard**: I don't know what he is taking from this, but it sounds like he was talking.
**Jremillard**: His warehouse lighting was up to 9 million last night.
**Bclymer**: What?
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: So I, I don't know what he's looking at that he's coming up with all this crazy shit.
**Bclymer**: He's an electrical sub.
**Jremillard**: He's electrical and H vac, but I'm also working with other electrical people because this is just sounding too weird coming from him.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, because like Brandon figured 750 a light, which seems like a lot.
**Bclymer**: And maybe they're figuring the panels in there.
**Jremillard**: But do we have any cut sheets for the fixtures that Amazon wants in there?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, the light.
**Bclymer**: Brandon put that in his email to the Hermes about.
**Bclymer**: He asked him what.
**Bclymer**: What light fixtures did you.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, I was trying to find that chain and I don't think I was on it.
**Bclymer**: Here, let me find it.
**Bclymer**: Here.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I don't Know if I got that either.
**Jremillard**: I got the lighting lead times one to Sergio.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Let me send this to you right now.
**Jdawson**: Electrician doesn't think it's a ground up, does he?
**Jremillard**: No, I think he's overthinking it.
**Bclymer**: Well, yeah, because that would mean Those lights are four and a half times more than we budgeted.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Make it cost $3,000 per light to put them in.
**Bclymer**: What the.
**Bclymer**: Jesus.
**Bclymer**: So if you tell it.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I think brandon.
**Bclymer**: Based on two, 200 lights.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: Because he said he was coming up with 2400 based on the layout.
**Bclymer**: Was he including the ones in the offices or just the ones in the.
**Jremillard**: Just.
**Jremillard**: Just the ones in the bay.
**Bclymer**: He's figuring 2400 even.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, it was like 24, 132 or something like that.
**Jremillard**: It was weird.
**Jremillard**: Some off number.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: And we haven't talked to any fire sprinklers, so we'll just do a square foot number.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: And I just sent Andrew a fire sprinkler guy.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: We'll get a square footage.
**Bclymer**: The offices plumbing you got seemed reasonable H vac, hopefully.
**Bclymer**: Those guys.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, I should be able to get something out of them.
**Jremillard**: I don't know if I'll be able to get a budget number today out of them, though.
**Bclymer**: Because if these, you know, the local electrician, I don't know if they're coming in super high.
**Bclymer**: We can go with Dean because they work for us all the time.
**Bclymer**: We can get.
**Bclymer**: We can get the number to get to where we need to be.
**Jremillard**: That one that's bidding high is.
**Jremillard**: Is the Vegas guy, too.
**Jremillard**: So he's probably got like housing and per diem and shit put on there.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: So I think the local.
**Jremillard**: The other guys are all local.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: And I've done about 25 million worth of work with Matt, so I know that they know what they're looking at when they're bidding and what when they're working.
**Bclymer**: Okay, good deal.
**Bclymer**: The fence and parking lot again will.
**Jremillard**: Yep.
**Jremillard**: The odds and ends guys bidding that.
**Jremillard**: And then I just sent Andrew a metal fence guy.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: And they're all locals.
**Bclymer**: For five grand, we should be able to buy that guard shack if we had to, right?
**Jremillard**: Yeah, that would just be the shack.
**Jremillard**: No, it's mini split or anything.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: If we put a mini split in there, is the H vac guy going to figure anything for that?
**Bclymer**: Or we just plug that.
**Jremillard**: I would plug it.
**Bclymer**: So put another five grand for that.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, that would be very safe.
**Jremillard**: I think.
**Bclymer**: 10 grand in there.
**Jremillard**: There's power out to that location already.
**Jremillard**: Right.
**Bclymer**: There's sleeves out there.
**Bclymer**: We just have.
**Jremillard**: Okay, yeah.
**Jremillard**: Then that's.
**Jremillard**: That should be very good.
**Jdawson**: Jesse, you said for that dock equipment it's just they're picking the most cost effective equipment and that you had spoken with Freddy.
**Jdawson**: He had told you that he knows what dock equipment Amazon uses typically and that it's in stock.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, that's what he said.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And you can just tell them like they want to match the light.
**Bclymer**: The fan light combos and I send them a picture of what those are.
**Bclymer**: I don't have a spec sheet on them, but I would think if they're in the dock equipment industry, they would look at it, know immediately what the fuck it is.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: And.
**Bclymer**: And then that architect, the local architect they ever get back to you and we just.
**Jremillard**: What's that?
**Bclymer**: We just need the life safety.
**Bclymer**: Brandon wants to just use our MEP subs but his.
**Bclymer**: If that one guy wanted a half a million to design it, that.
**Bclymer**: Holy shit.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: And Kevin, that VLMK did get back to me this morning that he was able to access everything and he's looking through it all.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Jremillard**: And next week, Wednesday or Friday afternoon are the only two days I can go to the site.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: Or.
**Jremillard**: Or Monday, but that's too soon to set up.
**Jremillard**: Probably.
**Bclymer**: Just send a text message to Brandon and tell him see if he can get with Bill and find out when you just getting those options for you.
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And then he'll get with Bill and get you access.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: So I don't.
**Jremillard**: I don't remember.
**Jremillard**: Is that guard shack power on the electrical scope?
**Jremillard**: Andrew?
**Jdawson**: Say that one more time.
**Jdawson**: Sorry.
**Jremillard**: Is the guard shack power on the electrical scope and is the mini split on the H vac scope?
**Jdawson**: The mini split is see if that the guard check should be or maybe not on an electric cool provide install power to new guard shack.
**Jdawson**: Yes, it's on electrical.
**Jremillard**: Perfect.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: So that'll get captured and then.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: First line for H Vac provide and install AC unit ductless mini split.
**Jremillard**: That other roofer I sent you, Andrew.
**Jremillard**: If he gets the plans he should be able to also pull us a budget number if you want to just race to see who we can get one from faster.
**Jdawson**: Yes, I'm seeing this email right now.
**Jdawson**: It's a Christian.
**Bclymer**: Would you figure just.
**Bclymer**: Is it one or two?
**Bclymer**: We'll probably need a couple RTUs for the big or May.
**Bclymer**: Do you think just one would do it for the.
**Bclymer**: The main break room?
**Jremillard**: I would think so.
**Bclymer**: One, One each.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: And when I told the H Vac subs I just said plan on RTUs and curbs.
**Jremillard**: I didn't specify a number because they.
**Bclymer**: Don'T have to cool any of the bathrooms that are by themselves.
**Bclymer**: It's just those three office areas.
**Bclymer**: So I can't imagine that'll be more than 150, maybe 200.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, I think that, Yeah, I think that's realistic.
**Bclymer**: Because we just got.
**Bclymer**: Of course, that's the old.
**Bclymer**: I don't know how much more that refrigerant is.
**Bclymer**: We were just replaced five of them on a rooftops on a job and it was 150 for five of them.
**Bclymer**: All right, but they didn't have to.
**Bclymer**: They used like a curb adapter.
**Bclymer**: They were replacing existing ones.
**Bclymer**: But.
**Bclymer**: So what do you think if like we go and plug all these numbers, we got our name too.
**Bclymer**: You spin your mat.
**Bclymer**: Do you want to just check back in an hour or two for an hour and just see what progress you think you'll make if you make some calls?
**Jremillard**: Yeah, I can check back whenever.
**Jremillard**: Whenever works for you guys.
**Jremillard**: My only other on the books meeting today is 2:30 to 3.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: And new H vac with the new refrigerant is expected to be 35% higher.
**Jremillard**: Steel building materials up 5%.
**Jremillard**: H vac equipment general up 8.
**Jremillard**: Conduit up 10.
**Jremillard**: Copper up 5.
**Jremillard**: Aluminum storefronts are at like 60 to 90 day lead times.
**Jremillard**: Pricing is good for a week.
**Bclymer**: Damn.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, I just kind of started an email chain keeping everybody looped in on price increases and that was all the stuff that I had in there.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So yeah, maybe now we're.
**Bclymer**: We go 250 on H vac 30%.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: Is there any on the tail end of completing this project, assuming that this GMP is a lot higher, is there any like type of credit that's going to go back to them or anything?
**Jremillard**: Or is this all our kind of contingency allowance?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And we'll plug it.
**Bclymer**: We'll do a contingency, whatever, 5%, 10% for them to carry them on their end to cover stuff.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, I just, Yeah, I didn't know how this was going to shake out when we actually figured out how much this thing cost at the end versus the truck.
**Jremillard**: GMP cost the contracts on.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I mean typically it's.
**Bclymer**: They just give us a PO and that's what it is.
**Bclymer**: So if we can buy it out and make money, we keep it.
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, he offered them, hey, just release this.
**Bclymer**: We'll do a cost plus.
**Bclymer**: I don't think they want to do that.
**Bclymer**: They'd rather just know what it, what it's going to be.
**Bclymer**: And yeah, if it works, you go for it.
**Jremillard**: If it doesn't, that GMP is just how much in the red we are.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: So we'll just.
**Bclymer**: I'll let Brandon know we're gonna meet back in an hour.
**Bclymer**: That means it's your time will be.
**Jremillard**: Do you want to say two o' clock my time?
**Bclymer**: Two o' clock your time.
**Bclymer**: Okay, that works.
**Jremillard**: Is that four art or that's five your time.
**Bclymer**: Five our time.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, that'll give me some time to make some rounds and try to get some stuff, more stuff in.
**Bclymer**: Okay, awesome.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: And like if we have to go in, I think we've got enough.
**Bclymer**: I mean we got 500000 to demo and pour back the dock levelers.
**Bclymer**: When you think about overall that to me that's selling some door banger type sound to come in and do it.
**Bclymer**: They'll do it all day.
**Bclymer**: You know, we'll find someone that wants to with you know, pick up and truck type, take them out, make a half a million dollars for a couple month to work.
**Bclymer**: Not that we want to do that.
**Bclymer**: I know.
**Bclymer**: We're trying to get you out of those subs that you've been dealing with.
**Jremillard**: Oh God.
**Jdawson**: Hey, Jesse, now I'm looking at these contacts.
**Jdawson**: I'll need emails and company names for all of these.
**Jdawson**: You're able to.
**Jdawson**: Looks like Eric.
**Jdawson**: Eric is good.
**Jdawson**: Just Monty, Kevin, Bill and Daniel.
**Jremillard**: I'll need those for Monty, Kevin, Bill and Daniel.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I knit up their email and company name.
**Jdawson**: Didn't send with the contact.
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, this is from an electrical contractor so he's probably just got them by names but I can get them.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, once I get that email I.
**Bclymer**: Can shoot those drawings.
**Bclymer**: Andrew, you want to just call them up and ask them for their email?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, do that.
**Bclymer**: And then Jesse can concentrate on making the calls he's got lined up.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, I think he will be able to get us the lighting package numbers we want today.
**Jremillard**: I think they're just going to be really high, but I have a.
**Jremillard**: Dan has had this since Tuesday as well.
**Jremillard**: So hopefully Dan can spit something out that's more realistic.
**Jremillard**: He's local and warehouses are his thing.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right, Me and Andrew are going to get to work on this or I'll work on this.
**Bclymer**: Plug in some numbers.
**Bclymer**: Andrew, go ahead and make those calls and get those guys all set up and then once you're done with all the contacts and you got them entered.
**Bclymer**: Just call me back.
**Jremillard**: Do you need a office FF&E vendor.
**Bclymer**: As far as the owner's furniture and stuff?
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: Is that.
**Jremillard**: I didn't look if that stuff was on us because I saw, like, signage, package and stuff like that.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I think so.
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: They didn't mention the lockers either.
**Bclymer**: So maybe they got a national account with someone that puts their lockers in.
**Bclymer**: I don't know.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, because they're.
**Jremillard**: What's that?
**Bclymer**: I was just going to plug a number for it.
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: Because they're doing all the racking, all the speed bays, and then the rest is R scope, right?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: That's it.
**Jremillard**: All right.
**Bclymer**: We will reconvene.
**Bclymer**: Five o' clock.
**Jdawson**: Perfect.
**Jremillard**: Thanks, guys.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: Thank you.
**Bclymer**: We'll see you.
