## Transcript
**Ataylor**: Using local resources.
**Ataylor**: So in the Indy market, I'll look to, you know, the Brads of the world to say, who do I need to invite as bidding partners?
**Ataylor**: And then we can invite those in the Fort Wayne market, the same thing there.
**Ataylor**: I'll invite the Fort Wayne market and in the South Bend market, the same thing, Lafayette.
**Ataylor**: But this is kind of a meet and greet to get to know you guys, to know the extent of what you guys are capable of doing.
**Ataylor**: You know, I've had the opportunity to work with some contractors, and, you know, if it's a $200,000 or less project, they really don't, you know, those are too small.
**Ataylor**: They don't want to do it.
**Ataylor**: Then I've had guys that, you know, again, on the other side, they, you know, they say, hey, I don't want, I don't want to.
**Ataylor**: That's a remodel.
**Ataylor**: I really don't want to touch those.
**Ataylor**: I want a fresh build type of thing.
**Ataylor**: I don't want to get into the mess of all that.
**Ataylor**: So really look into what, what it is your portfolio is.
**Ataylor**: You know, what, you know, what do you self reform.
**Ataylor**: What do you, you know, hire out, you know, what scales of jobs don't you do?
**Dplank**: Yeah, certainly.
**Dplank**: So, so we're, we're nationwide.
**Dplank**: I think we've got projects going on in like 11 states right now.
**Dplank**: So we've got a Indianapolis office, and then we also have a Tampa office.
**Dplank**: And so traditionally, most of our stuff is, is a lot of it's design build.
**Dplank**: So most of our clients, the speed is important to them.
**Dplank**: And so that's why they, they look at that avenue.
**Dplank**: Uh, but there's, you know, other times when again, like, you know, that we do a design bid build.
**Dplank**: Typically, you know, with, with our clients, they don't like, change orders.
**Dplank**: So that's why 90% of our stuff is design build, because we hate it more than you guys.
**Dplank**: Whenever we look at plans like, sorry, your plumbing engineer didn't coordinate with the architect.
**Dplank**: And.
**Dplank**: Well, what do you mean?
**Dplank**: Like, well, I don't know what to tell you.
**Dplank**: Like, sorry, but here's your change.
**Dplank**: Like, you made me bit the plan.
**Dplank**: So, you know, that's our, that's our bread and butter.
**Dplank**: That's what we're good at.
**Dplank**: We have, you know, internal design guys.
**Dplank**: So typically, like, so some clients, you know, they want to, you know, do design up front.
**Dplank**: We always encourage them to what we do, design assist.
**Dplank**: So I let us check your plans before you get them completely done and help you coordinate that because, like, you know, it's like, oh, it's going to be a $2 million build based off of these plans, but then there's $300,000 in change orders for stuff that doesn't match.
**Dplank**: And so that's, that's usually a, you know, service that we'll do with certain clients just for free, just to help them be successful in their projects.
**Dplank**: You know, as far as our, like, what we do size wise.
**Dplank**: So like it's hard for us to really be competitive under a half a million.
**Dplank**: Like we don't self perform.
**Dplank**: We're not.
**Dplank**: You know, I need to take this wall down.
**Dplank**: Like that's not our jam.
**Dplank**: Like there's no, there's no value add there that we can really bring.
**Dplank**: Like you can just go to Angie's List or something, you know, and that would be fine.
**Dplank**: So that's, you know, that's probably, you know, hard for us to bring value anything less than that.
**Dplank**: Our biggest job, you know, right now is, you know, we got a single building that's 40 million down in Savannah and then we've got a master development that's I think it's 900 million down in Fort Myers.
**Ataylor**: That's.
**Ataylor**: I can promise you we'll have nothing even close to that.
**Ataylor**: So our, my biggest spend right now on a build was 1.7 million.
**Ataylor**: So that site work and building.
**Ataylor**: So.
**Dplank**: Yeah, okay.
**Dplank**: Yeah.
**Dplank**: But you know, we, that's, that's our, you know, some of our biggest, you know, ones that, that we're, we're working with.
**Dplank**: I think right now we've got in the indie market trying to think what's that size?
**Dplank**: We just finished one restaurant that I think was like 2.3 ground up.
**Dplank**: And then, and then we've got obviously your, your.
**Dplank**: A lot of your TI buildouts are going to be, you know, in the 5 to 2 million dollars range.
**Dplank**: But ground up wise, I think that's the smallest one.
**Dplank**: We've got another one that's like 8 million.
**Dplank**: But as far as ground up, I think that's probably the smallest one we've got currently.
**Dplank**: This is AJ Taylor, he's one of our project executives.
**Dplank**: So he knows Troy.
**Dplank**: He always plays golf with him and stuff.
**Dplank**: So I, I invite, invited him to this call.
**Dplank**: So, you know, Brad is on the, on the banking side and Dan handles the construction, expansion, capital improvements for center.
**Dplank**: So this is kind of a meet and greet.
**Dplank**: I just wanted, wanted you to, to know who's who.
**Ataylor**: Oh, perfect.
**Ataylor**: I think.
**Dplank**: Yeah.
**Mcalcetero**: I'm sorry, I'm, I'm rushing back I'm two minutes from the office, so.
**Bclymer**: Well, I'll concentrate on the road.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, yeah, concentrate on the road.
**Dplank**: Don't.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: So I apologize, aj.
**Bclymer**: I kicked you out of the meeting.
**Bclymer**: I have another contractor that's not in the GC space, their sub, and a specialty that's also named AJ Taylor.
**Bclymer**: So I saw you join the meeting.
**Ataylor**: And I booted you.
**Bclymer**: Thinking that he somehow got the invite.
**Bclymer**: I was like, he's not on here.
**Bclymer**: I don't know how he got it.
**Mcalcetero**: I was like.
**Mcalcetero**: I was like, guys, I swear I'll turn my camera on when I'll get there.
**Bclymer**: No, no, I.
**Bclymer**: Absolutely.
**Bclymer**: Fine.
**Bclymer**: I sent him a text and I was like, I don't know how you got this invite, but, you know, this is just not something that's related to anything you guys do.
**Bclymer**: And so he's.
**Bclymer**: He sent me a response back that just said, I have no clue what you're talking about.
**Bclymer**: And you rejoined.
**Bclymer**: So I was like, okay, I.
**Bclymer**: I clearly had things.
**Mcalcetero**: All good.
**Mcalcetero**: I'm.
**Mcalcetero**: I'm pulling in right now, so.
**Mcalcetero**: But yeah, so I've known Troy for a couple years now.
**Mcalcetero**: We.
**Mcalcetero**: We do golf a lot together.
**Mcalcetero**: And then I think we.
**Mcalcetero**: We had.
**Mcalcetero**: We took Troy out to the US Open.
**Dplank**: Right.
**Mcalcetero**: Brandon, a couple years back.
**Mcalcetero**: And so we've been.
**Mcalcetero**: We've been fostering that relationship for some time.
**Mcalcetero**: So we're excited to be able to show you guys how we can help.
**Ataylor**: Great.
**Dplank**: So, Dan, what's one thing that as you guys are building, obviously you've been doing a lot of stuff, but why even entertain working with anybody else?
**Dplank**: I mean, are there certain things that aren't going well or things that you want to see approved?
**Ataylor**: No, actually, I'll give you the flat out answer.
**Ataylor**: I've used myern Agem.
**Ataylor**: They've done a fantastic job for us.
**Ataylor**: They've delivered.
**Ataylor**: But I approached them about creating some type of banking relationship and they've been a little bit hesitant.
**Ataylor**: So, you know, that's part of it.
**Ataylor**: I've used Powers and Sons for some specific projects and I will continue to tap on Powers and Sons when it's in a market area where I feel I need minority participation.
**Ataylor**: But in the indie market, we've.
**Ataylor**: Let's see, I've used Holiday Construction, which actually they're doing some design build work for me.
**Ataylor**: So I completely get what you're talking about on speed to market, the limited change orders, all of those type of things.
**Ataylor**: So I get it.
**Ataylor**: Holiday and Centur bank have a really good banking relationship and we've done A lot of projects together, so they'll continue to be bid on projects.
**Ataylor**: But it's kind of like everything that I, you know, you guys are all busy and sometimes contractor A is not as busy as contractor B and can give me a little bit better price.
**Ataylor**: Sometimes I need, I need to bid things just to sharpen the pencil on all sides.
**Ataylor**: And then the other thing, I need depth of bench, right?
**Ataylor**: So I, in the indie market, if I've got multiple things going on, I need a bench that I can rely on.
**Ataylor**: So that's why I'm doing, doing these, you know, under, you know, trying to build relationships is that I gotta be quite frank.
**Ataylor**: There's.
**Ataylor**: There's been projects where I had a superintendent on the job with Holiday that just screwed the pooch.
**Ataylor**: And I had to send a message, a hard message, and to go with another contractor on a project to send the message that I can't be your guys's second thought, I have to be your primary thought on things.
**Ataylor**: And likewise, if we build a relationship, you know, I'm assuming that you're going to give us your A team all the time and you're going to give us the best price, but I have to, you know, trust but verify type thing.
**Dplank**: So.
**Dplank**: Dan, one thing, and you know, everybody always talks about relationships and they all want that.
**Dplank**: I can tell you one thing about some of our trade partners.
**Dplank**: I don't know if you've heard of cart.com, you know, where their national construction arm.
**Dplank**: We do anything in the country that, that when they expand buildings, we just get a call, they say, hey, blah, blah, blah, Texas got it.
**Dplank**: We were doing a job for a few years ago and I got a call from, you know, the VP over there and he's like, hey, Brandon, listen, you know, your, your guy is, you know, he's, he's up.
**Dplank**: I don't, I'm not feeling the love, the communication.
**Dplank**: I said, okay, great.
**Dplank**: And then that way I can immediately rectify it.
**Dplank**: So, like, that's what I would expect in a relationship because at the end of the day, I mess up every day.
**Dplank**: Absolutely.
**Dplank**: And I like to say that, you know, oh, like we're going to give you the best.
**Dplank**: And I hold a standard, but man, sometimes people have bad days.
**Dplank**: Some people don't know that they're screwing up.
**Dplank**: And so hearing that, to me, my request always is from a client is like, look, my cell phone is in my signature and I always answer.
**Dplank**: And so if you're not feeling the love or you're not saying like that help Us improve.
**Dplank**: Hey, here's what's not going on.
**Dplank**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: And, yeah, and trust me, on, on the, on the situation that I talked about is, is with Holiday.
**Ataylor**: They were more than aware that there was a problem.
**Ataylor**: Right.
**Ataylor**: So it was a situation where they, they literally had somebody screw the pooch and, and bid a project that was.
**Ataylor**: I don't know where they got these contract bids from, but they were completely wrong.
**Ataylor**: And they.
**Ataylor**: So they.
**Ataylor**: This guy, finally, they fired this guy.
**Ataylor**: They.
**Ataylor**: They accepted the project.
**Ataylor**: But then they.
**Ataylor**: And I'm going to be quite frank here is they brought a group of Mexicans to frame the building, and they showed up in flip flops and shorts to frame a building.
**Ataylor**: And I'm walking through and there's nothing square, nothing level, nothing parallel.
**Ataylor**: And I pointed, you know, so they've almost had to reframe the building.
**Ataylor**: And this is with a new superintendent, a new project manager.
**Ataylor**: So.
**Ataylor**: And I'm still to this day dealing with issues with a building that, you know, has some water issues periodically in a couple of key areas.
**Dplank**: So basically, they brought in their residential guys to do it on the cheap, because they do that.
**Dplank**: Yeah.
**Dplank**: Yeah, I can see that.
**Dplank**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: So, you know, it was.
**Ataylor**: I'm a straight shooter when it comes to projects, and if somebody's screwing up, just like, if I'm screwing up, I expect somebody to call me on the carpet and tell me, hey, you screwed up.
**Ataylor**: I'm a, you know, I've been in the business long enough and I don't have enough time on the earth to play nice anymore.
**Ataylor**: That, here's what I expect, here's what I'm paying you for.
**Ataylor**: Let's.
**Ataylor**: Let's figure out how to get it done and let's do it.
**Ataylor**: So like I said, and it was one of those with, like I said, with Holiday that they, you know, they started out wrong and they improved it, but not to the level that I felt good about.
**Ataylor**: So I had to, you know, I once bitten, twice shy.
**Ataylor**: I had to at least, you know, try something else.
**Ataylor**: So that's, that's the relationship that we had.
**Ataylor**: But no, trust me, if we work together and there's.
**Ataylor**: There's a problem, everybody will know about it.
**Ataylor**: You know, I tend to.
**Ataylor**: I tend to be civil about it, you know, but it's one of those that everything rolls downhill in the end.
**Ataylor**: And I've got a CEO that is expecting that, hey, something's on time, something's on budget, and the quality is there.
**Ataylor**: So I try to deliver every time.
**Dplank**: Yeah, absolutely.
**Dplank**: I mean, we get paid on the results, not by the hour.
**Ataylor**: You got it.
**Ataylor**: You got it.
**Ataylor**: So thank you.
**Ataylor**: That was.
**Ataylor**: I'm glad that you called that out because yeah, I'm not, I'm not the type that says, hey, I'm pissed off so I'm just going to go somewhere else.
**Dplank**: We're all men here.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, you're going to know that I'm pissed off and I'm probably going to tell you that I'm going to go somewhere else next time.
**Dplank**: Absolutely.
**Dplank**: Who does most your designs currently?
**Ataylor**: Well, that's an even better question.
**Ataylor**: So for the longest time we're using Jessica Vargas who actually works with Holiday Properties but she has recently been promoted.
**Ataylor**: She's been doing some long term stay hotel work for holidays.
**Ataylor**: So she's been pulled, has been able to do design.
**Ataylor**: So we've used Roland Design, actually it's Luminant now we've used Shoot.
**Ataylor**: Who, who did our Brownsburg, Another one in indie market.
**Ataylor**: We're working with a company called Adrenaline International.
**Ataylor**: They do a lot of banking stuff.
**Ataylor**: So we really haven't landed on a true.
**Ataylor**: This is our architect yet.
**Ataylor**: We're kind of rethinking our design and layout a little bit.
**Ataylor**: But like in Westfield, for instance, I've got a project that's going to be, it's a design build, maximum guaranteed price.
**Ataylor**: But it's.
**Ataylor**: I've got to have it open by the end of June next year.
**Ataylor**: So we're taking a design that we did with holiday in St.
**Ataylor**: John and we're putting it on a piece of land in Westfield.
**Ataylor**: So, you know, Jessica, similar to you, you know, she does the drawings and she works really well with Holiday Construction and, and she can cheat the drawings because she knows the contractor will talk behind the scenes to correct any errors, unlike a design bid build.
**Ataylor**: So in that situation, because I was under duress to get this thing within a short period of time, I'm going with them on it.
**Ataylor**: But we're rethinking what does our future branch look like.
**Ataylor**: So that's why we're working with a national firm to assist us.
**Dplank**: Yeah, yeah.
**Dplank**: Just to forget a new set of eyes on a lot of times helps, you know, what are they doing in Arizona?
**Dplank**: Right.
**Dplank**: You know, things like that.
**Dplank**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: How do you know, how do we make, you know, banking as, you know, banking's changing and how to.
**Ataylor**: We're very focused on customer service.
**Ataylor**: So how do we take the customer service side of things, the Disney side of things and bring that into the banking to where when customers come in they feel, you know, they feel, you know, really care.
**Ataylor**: They can take care of their banking.
**Ataylor**: We can they, we become their confidant and their, in all their matters, money.
**Dplank**: So yeah, I mean, you look at the way that you see the national banks, you know, your Chase, pnc, Wells Fargo, all that stuff, they're moving more and more towards, you know, less tellers, more of just a drive through and you walk up and you go to the atm.
**Dplank**: And on the surface it makes sense because transactions, you know, don't always create revenue.
**Dplank**: Right.
**Dplank**: And you're driving down your labor force.
**Dplank**: But when you see a shift like that, people start starving for human interaction.
**Dplank**: You know, we have a, there's a, there's a saying.
**Dplank**: You know, I use this in different businesses.
**Dplank**: The riches are in the niches and customer service is becoming a niche market.
**Dplank**: And catering to that, I think pays dividends.
**Ataylor**: Well, you're talking to the bank that just won the J.D.
**Ataylor**: power Award for customer service.
**Ataylor**: And actually we had the highest score in the United States for customer service.
**Ataylor**: But our award is only for like the northwest region.
**Ataylor**: So customer and we.
**Ataylor**: Best places to work, 19 out of the past 20 years.
**Ataylor**: And the reason we didn't do it the first year is because we didn't know it existed.
**Ataylor**: But our whole thing is customer service.
**Ataylor**: And you're absolutely right.
**Ataylor**: I want to make a branch that we have.
**Ataylor**: When you walk in, you can take care of your transactions, we can cash your check, we can, you know, do all that thing.
**Ataylor**: But then if you want to talk about a mortgage, you want to talk about a loan, you want to talk about cd, you want to talk about, you know, investment for the future, you know, we're there for you and we can be that, we want to be that.
**Ataylor**: So that's really kind of where, where we're headed on the design side of things is how do we take, you know, the, what is the new, new footprint of a, you know, bank look like?
**Ataylor**: How do we manage the drive thru customers and not turn our back on the, on the, on the teller line?
**Ataylor**: You know, it's all of those fun things that we have to take into consideration.
**Ataylor**: So that's why we're, we're looking at somebody nationally because I, the local guys are, you know, you're only privy to what you're used to.
**Ataylor**: So the national guys see a little, see a little bit broader lens.
**Dplank**: Yeah, the new, the new neighborhood bank.
**Dplank**: So one thing, it's funny, I don't know if you guys have looked at this, but.
**Dplank**: So like I said, we have a Tampa office and there's actually a.
**Dplank**: You know, I can't remember what the bank is, but it's actually.
**Dplank**: They've got a coffee shop and a bank right in there.
**Dplank**: Because I've gone in there to the coffee shop and I'm like, what's this?
**Ataylor**: Like, Capital One?
**Dplank**: Maybe that's it.
**Dplank**: I don't know.
**Dplank**: But I was like, this is pretty cool.
**Dplank**: Like, you know, an actual.
**Dplank**: And people hang out there, like, you know, at the end of the day, like, is that something you guys look at all or what are your thoughts on that?
**Dplank**: Just curious.
**Ataylor**: You know, we, we looked at that a few years ago.
**Ataylor**: It's called a Capital One Cafe, and we, we actually visited several of them.
**Ataylor**: The concept is nice, but the thing is, is it does not rely.
**Ataylor**: It's fine for if you're getting coffee, but if you really want to talk to a banker, if you literally want to talk to somebody, you have to make an appointment.
**Ataylor**: So it becomes very inconvenient.
**Ataylor**: So, so what our, what our thing now is, is we have, at every one of our branches, we have the ability with a Keurig to do hot cocoa, coffee, whatever it is.
**Ataylor**: So we offer that free amenity to everybody that they can, they can come in and, you know, have that while they're waiting to talk to one of our bankers.
**Ataylor**: So we're.
**Ataylor**: I don't, I don't think we're going to go to the coffee shop model because I.
**Ataylor**: It focuses, in our opinion, too much on coffee and not on the banking relationship.
**Dplank**: Makes sense.
**Dplank**: Yeah, no, I.
**Dplank**: Just curious because, I mean, again, at the end of the day, right, you see Internet banks and stuff like that popping up.
**Dplank**: It's like, how can you, you know, be attractive, right?
**Dplank**: Like, what is it that gets people in there and, you know, to, to use your services and at the end of the day, right, when, like.
**Dplank**: Yeah, so for me, like, you know, like talking about switching banks, it's like, yeah, I'm open to it.
**Dplank**: I was like, how.
**Dplank**: The only reason we use the damn bank we have now is because it's what I had.
**Dplank**: You know, it's, it's longevity thing.
**Ataylor**: Well, what we want.
**Ataylor**: What we want is when you walk in the door to a Centur bank, they're gonna say, hey, Brandon, how are you doing?
**Ataylor**: How the, how the kids?
**Ataylor**: How's the.
**Ataylor**: You know, that's, that's what we're focusing on.
**Ataylor**: And that's.
**Ataylor**: Every bank sells the same product, right?
**Ataylor**: Every bank does the same thing.
**Ataylor**: What differentiates us is our.
**Ataylor**: Is we hire the best people to Take care of our customers.
**Ataylor**: We, you know, and then.
**Ataylor**: So I don't mean to preach the.
**Ataylor**: To the choir about it, but our focus is customer service, so that's, you know, we kind of take it all the way through.
**Ataylor**: My job is to make sure that the Brads of the world have the space that they need so they can take care of the customers.
**Dplank**: Yeah, absolutely.
**Dplank**: That's awesome.
**Dplank**: Yeah.
**Dplank**: I said I love where you guys are going.
**Dplank**: Like, I, you know, Alito's, you know, you know, business I own and other businesses and interests and stuff, but just in general, you know, when I look at working with some.
**Dplank**: Because you.
**Dplank**: I mean, anybody can put up four walls and a roof, right?
**Dplank**: Like, life's too short to work with people that you don't like.
**Dplank**: We don't do that at all.
**Dplank**: You know, it's got to be enjoyable.
**Dplank**: You got to love what you do.
**Dplank**: And, and for me, you know, working with people that, like, have a cool business mindset, they're always looking to improve and innovate.
**Dplank**: You know, I, I preach to our guys, like, if you have to improve every day, no matter something, always be improving.
**Dplank**: Like, because the moment that you're not, you'll get passed up.
**Dplank**: And so it's, It's.
**Dplank**: It's.
**Dplank**: It's great to hear that you guys are the same way.
**Dplank**: And, you know, it's.
**Dplank**: It's.
**Dplank**: I like just knocking things out, being on the same page and just getting shit done.
**Ataylor**: Hey, man, it sounds like you're in one of my team meetings.
**Ataylor**: That's one of the things I tell my team all the time, is that our job is just get shit done.
**Ataylor**: And I driving in today, I was, I was.
**Ataylor**: I actually talked to one of my co workers about this, is that, you know, I talk about people being cowboy, right?
**Ataylor**: And just kind of going.
**Ataylor**: Going wild.
**Ataylor**: And I told my team, I said, you know, original.
**Ataylor**: I thought about it this morning that we were cowboy.
**Ataylor**: And I said, no, I said, we're not cowboy because the cowboy just pulls their guns and fires in the air for no reason.
**Ataylor**: I said, we're farmers.
**Ataylor**: I said, we get shit done.
**Ataylor**: And when we pull our gun, we're killing something.
**Ataylor**: And we.
**Ataylor**: That we mean.
**Ataylor**: That's all we mean to kill.
**Dplank**: That's a sniper.
**Dplank**: One shot, one kill.
**Ataylor**: Yep.
**Ataylor**: So.
**Ataylor**: So that's.
**Ataylor**: That's our new thing is, is we're farmers.
**Ataylor**: We just get shit done.
**Ataylor**: We know it has.
**Ataylor**: We have to do when we get shit done.
**Dplank**: I love it.
**Dplank**: I love that.
**Dplank**: Might have to steal that one.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Dplank**: Awesome.
**Dplank**: Well, like, again, I, I love, I love the conversation.
**Dplank**: I appreciate it.
**Dplank**: What else do you have questions for.
**Ataylor**: For me, Nothing right now.
**Ataylor**: You answered it.
**Ataylor**: And, and I appreciate the honesty about the, the, the factor of, you know, the smaller projects just aren't in your, your wheelhouse because there's no, there's no benefit to it.
**Ataylor**: A lot of what we do is rehabbing some projects.
**Ataylor**: I've got one in Greenwood right now that it's going to be a, you know, a couple hundred thousand dollars touch.
**Ataylor**: But I'll focus, I'll focus the attention to the larger projects that you guys will be in your wheelhouse, but I will, you know, and I got the, I got the Troys and the Brads on my back, making sure that I include you guys.
**Ataylor**: So, so you got, you got a good team there.
**Ataylor**: They highly recommended that I talk to you and bring you to the table.
**Ataylor**: So I do appreciate the time and I do appreciate the candor and honesty.
**Dplank**: Yeah.
**Dplank**: And it's, I mean, not to say that again.
**Dplank**: Some of our clients, I mean, most of our clients, it's all negotiated work.
**Dplank**: And so they can have us go do something.
**Dplank**: 100,000, 200,000, doesn't matter because we're just invoicing them.
**Dplank**: But you know, in honesty, right, if you're like, hey, Brayden, I got this job, it's 300,000, like, man, we're just not going to be competitive, hard bidding, that kind of small thing.
**Ataylor**: It just, and I appreciate that.
**Ataylor**: That's, that's the honesty that I look for.
**Ataylor**: Right.
**Ataylor**: I don't, I don't want somebody to come to me and say, hey, I, you know, I'll take anything from a $50 project to a 30 million dollar project when, and likewise, I don't, I don't want to get people over their skis, you know, on, on projects.
**Dplank**: So, yeah, like I said, we, we could easily knock it out, but to waste the time bidding it and stuff, it's like, guys, we're just like, you know, there's other smaller guys that are more specialized than that that are going to be better at bidding that stuff.
**Dplank**: Now if you need something done quick and you know, call us and we'll handle it.
**Ataylor**: All right, cool.
**Ataylor**: I appreciate the time.
