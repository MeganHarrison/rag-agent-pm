## Transcript
**Bclymer**: Jesse.
**Mike**: Hey, Brandon.
**Jdawson**: How things look on site?
**Jdawson**: You hear me?
**Mike**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: How do things look on site?
**Mike**: Good.
**Mike**: Good.
**Mike**: They agrees or just.
**Mike**: Chad said he told them not to do them last week because it was muddy.
**Mike**: And I'm like, when I was going to rain tomorrow, I said, so whenever they show up Thursday.
**Bclymer**: You broke up.
**Jdawson**: You said, when they show up Thursday.
**Jdawson**: What?
**Mike**: Oh, I don't care how muddy it is.
**Mike**: They need to just get them put in.
**Mike**: You're out of time.
**Mike**: Like.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Mike**: I mean, I don't give a.
**Mike**: They'll be scraping off the top.
**Jdawson**: Foot.
**Mike**: Or two foot of every one of them when they dig the foundation.
**Mike**: So.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, if we gotta regrade it.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Mike**: I mean, half of it gets cut down for the volleyball court.
**Jdawson**: Exactly.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Mike**: Like, won't get poured for months.
**Mike**: It's gonna get, you know, it's gonna get.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I'll get destroyed.
**Mike**: With the.
**Mike**: Some volleyball people.
**Mike**: Talk to her for a little bit.
**Jdawson**: Mike just texted me.
**Jdawson**: He's restarting his computer.
**Jdawson**: He said.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Mike**: This freaking spreadsheet.
**Mike**: I really hate it.
**Jdawson**: Which one?
**Mike**: Well, the one for Goodwill Foundations.
**Mike**: It didn't pull over.
**Mike**: Two lines we had for interior wood framing and window sills, crown molding.
**Jdawson**: All right, I won't create.
**Jdawson**: I will create a new one.
**Jdawson**: I will put that on my list.
**Jdawson**: I will.
**Jdawson**: I will.
**Jdawson**: I will create that tonight.
**Jdawson**: Because I'm sick and tired of us having this problem.
**Bclymer**: Hey, guys.
**Bclymer**: Sorry about that.
**Jdawson**: Don't let it happen.
**Jdawson**: If you're in the mic.
**Jdawson**: How dare you.
**Bclymer**: Wish Microsoft would do these things.
**Bclymer**: Not in the middle of the day.
**Bclymer**: Because.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, it's annoying.
**Bclymer**: God.
**Bclymer**: How you been, Jesse?
**Bclymer**: I've seen you in a while.
**Jdawson**: Good.
**Mike**: I was taking my daughter to Delaware last week.
**Mike**: She.
**Mike**: So she's.
**Bclymer**: I lost him.
**Bclymer**: Did you, Brandon?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, she's going to.
**Jdawson**: She's going to Delaware.
**Jdawson**: Wilmington area for an internship.
**Jdawson**: So he was moving her up there.
**Bclymer**: Oh, cool.
**Jdawson**: She's a attorney.
**Jdawson**: So smart.
**Jdawson**: Way smarter than all of us.
**Bclymer**: My favorite profession.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Mike**: I just like the free legal advice.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, that's.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Nice to have with the family.
**Jdawson**: Don't break the law.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So, Mike, I told Jesse a little bit about this Mesa, Arizona job.
**Jdawson**: Just very high level.
**Jdawson**: And so I, you know.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we'll just leave it that.
**Jdawson**: I mean, you know, he does.
**Jdawson**: He knows about as much as I do, which is just trying to talk to private equity to take this thing down.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So this group, it's the second ownership group, Jesse.
**Bclymer**: They picked it up about 18 months or so ago for pennies on the dollar.
**Bclymer**: I think 25 and a half was their purchase price on this originally it was close to 300 million.
**Bclymer**: The build, build cost on this, the father and son were the original developers just went to jail.
**Bclymer**: That just made news three or four weeks ago.
**Bclymer**: So it's got a bit of a tainted past.
**Bclymer**: You know we, we got involved with them my first year about there was September of last year, got a look at the grounds.
**Bclymer**: We were talking, thinking about doing a collective around the volleyball area and they've got this really cool sports bar that was there they weren't doing anything with.
**Bclymer**: They didn't know what they needed to do with it.
**Bclymer**: The whole breezeway that kind of leads into the sports bar, then out to volleyball and the, the largest turf complex in the country.
**Bclymer**: So I didn't feel comfortable going down a path because I didn't know how they were going to utilize that space where we gonna be competing.
**Bclymer**: So I put a plan in place to take over the restaurant.
**Bclymer**: They wanted us to go build, you know, spend 3 million bucks and build this other thing.
**Bclymer**: You know, why wouldn't they enhance their, their product?
**Bclymer**: So we walked from the deal.
**Bclymer**: Long story short, they came back to us in mid December about the restaurant and we ended up taking that over in President's Day weekend.
**Bclymer**: So we have the sports bar that's on site there.
**Bclymer**: I've got a really good working relationship with the president.
**Bclymer**: She's been there about a year and her executive staff.
**Bclymer**: She's had to run this thing with one arm tied behind her back.
**Bclymer**: Challenges at every turn.
**Bclymer**: Demands to have $0 EBITDA.
**Bclymer**: They're trending in the right direction.
**Bclymer**: They lost 7 million last year.
**Bclymer**: She said it should have been 3 to 4 this year but they demanded $0 EBITDA.
**Bclymer**: So she said, you know, you can, you can make the numbers look however you want on a pro forma, but it's just not, not going to happen.
**Bclymer**: And then they went out and got a 20 million dollar loan on it.
**Bclymer**: So she's responsible for that.
**Bclymer**: So she said it's about $2 million in debt service on there.
**Bclymer**: So not only go find the zero dollar ebitda.
**Bclymer**: Oh by the way, you're going to be saddled with this, these interest payments as well.
**Bclymer**: So I've had a little bit of interaction with this group.
**Bclymer**: Chad Brownstein is the owner of this group, Rocky Mountain Resources.
**Bclymer**: I think it is, he is, he's, he's an only other way to put it, I've only dealt with him once on one call.
**Bclymer**: We were making our proposal for the Sports bar.
**Bclymer**: Just a real jackass.
**Bclymer**: The way he's better than everybody on the call.
**Bclymer**: He'll let you know that he has a partner named Jonathan.
**Bclymer**: Ma.
**Bclymer**: Jonathan and I, I, I've had a lot of interaction with Jonathan.
**Bclymer**: He's a California guy.
**Bclymer**: We're, I think maybe Ivy League guy.
**Bclymer**: So you're going to get the.
**Bclymer**: What you'd expect from that.
**Bclymer**: But I find him to be a bit more pragmatic in his approach.
**Bclymer**: He's always been respectful towards me.
**Bclymer**: We've worked well together through the contract phase of everything.
**Bclymer**: So not sure the role he would play versus Chad in this.
**Bclymer**: I think Chad would be kind of leading the show on.
**Bclymer**: On this.
**Bclymer**: I think it was beneath Chad then once he was in the initial call that to deal with anything related to the restaurant.
**Bclymer**: I think that's how he operates.
**Bclymer**: But I think for this, Chad will be front and center for this whole thing.
**Bclymer**: So they, they went and overpromised on this loan.
**Bclymer**: President said that banks calling their bluff and she thinks that this thing can be taken down for about what they paid for, maybe a little bit extra where they can save face on a return to investors.
**Bclymer**: So this is, this is the primary space right here.
**Bclymer**: Areas of development south of the fields there, that, that area, that whole area all the way over to.
**Bclymer**: I don't see a road there.
**Bclymer**: That, that road.
**Bclymer**: That kind of run.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, right there.
**Bclymer**: And then all the way over to Ellsworth Road on the west side.
**Bclymer**: Yet Ellsworth is a main road.
**Bclymer**: And she just told me that they are expanding that it's two lanes and a turning lane right now.
**Bclymer**: They're going to make it three lanes on each side and a turning lane for all the anticipated growth that they're anticipating.
**Bclymer**: And then just off to the left here is the Mesa Airport.
**Bclymer**: So this is a great, great area for development of hotels, for one.
**Bclymer**: Not only because of the traffic that's coming into Arizona Athletic Grounds, but also because of the airport right there.
**Bclymer**: If you go down just a little bit, see Queen Creek right there.
**Bclymer**: They've had a tremendous amount of development in Queen Creek just to the south.
**Bclymer**: And now it's pushing towards.
**Bclymer**: Pushing north on Ellsworth.
**Jdawson**: About this right here.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Let's see.
**Bclymer**: We had here.
**Jdawson**: There's Ellsworth right here.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Just due south on Ellsworth into Queen Creek.
**Bclymer**: You can see all the housing and rooftops over there to the east.
**Bclymer**: Excuse me, the west of Ellsworth.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Look at all this.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Looks like this is already actually already developed.
**Jdawson**: This map's Old.
**Bclymer**: That's.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, that's.
**Bclymer**: That's either already or coming.
**Jdawson**: And then it's already.
**Jdawson**: It's already developed.
**Jdawson**: There's all the roads, everything.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So it's.
**Bclymer**: It's pushing that way.
**Bclymer**: And then if you go up Brandon, back to the complex itself over here, just north on the other side of 24, all these rooftops over here.
**Bclymer**: And yeah, if you go north, it's.
**Bclymer**: It.
**Bclymer**: There's no place where mesa to converge other than.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Kind of where we're at and what we're talking about here.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, this is already built.
**Jdawson**: This is already built.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So to have the foresight and what's shocking to me is this group came in, but it's what PE does.
**Bclymer**: I think they just thought they could leverage the asset assets, go get that big loan and you know, they didn't really care about the business.
**Bclymer**: The true play here is the development side.
**Bclymer**: She said probably 3 to 4 million in losses this year.
**Bclymer**: Close to break even next year.
**Bclymer**: In the black in 27.
**Bclymer**: But the players.
**Jdawson**: Mike, we can't hear you for some reason.
**Jdawson**: Can you hear him?
**Jdawson**: Jesse?
**Mike**: Yeah.
**Mike**: Your mic went off.
**Bclymer**: How about now?
**Mike**: Yeah, we can hear you.
**Jdawson**: Slow, very faint.
**Jdawson**: Nothing.
**Mike**: Still can't.
**Mike**: Can't hear you at all.
**Mike**: Now.
**Bclymer**: How about now?
**Jdawson**: There we go.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: Sorry about that, guys.
**Jdawson**: No worries.
**Bclymer**: I was saying that once this thing stabilizes, I don't think this is any more than maybe 3 to 5 million a year in profit from the sports side.
**Bclymer**: But the sports side drives the traffic and these surge weekends and things to the hotels.
**Bclymer**: It's the development piece that's really attractive here and really where we stand to profit.
**Jdawson**: I mean.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, this whole south area, you.
**Jdawson**: I mean, or the.
**Jdawson**: Or this area.
**Jdawson**: I mean this is.
**Jdawson**: This is all undeveloped.
**Jdawson**: All this stuff.
**Jdawson**: I mean you could do right here, you know, just right adjacent to where all this housing stuff is.
**Jdawson**: I mean a huge development with hotel, food and beverage, everything.
**Bclymer**: Yep, exactly.
**Bclymer**: And they had originally in their plot, she sent me a kind of a half assed map that they pulled together.
**Bclymer**: That's where they were going to put their hotels in that area.
**Bclymer**: Kind of where that dark pad is there.
**Jdawson**: I mean, it makes sense.
**Jdawson**: You've got the, you know, y.
**Jdawson**: Main.
**Jdawson**: Main thoroughfare here.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, this 20, you know, Highway 24, I mean, that's an exit ramp.
**Jdawson**: It looks like.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Oh, it's not even exit ramp.
**Jdawson**: It's not.
**Bclymer**: Oh no, up.
**Bclymer**: It's.
**Bclymer**: It's at Ellsworth is the exit ramp.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, well, but this this is an intersection.
**Jdawson**: I mean so.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: What's the, what's the road up north there?
**Jdawson**: Is that 202?
**Bclymer**: 202, sorry.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: 202 exit ramp is, is.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, but that's, I mean that's all connected, right?
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: And then 24.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, you pick up 24 right there.
**Bclymer**: So it's really convenient.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I mean so people can, you know.
**Jdawson**: Again, right here you've got great frontage.
**Jdawson**: And who owns this trap?
**Bclymer**: That is not part of the deal.
**Bclymer**: I'm not sure who owns that, but that's, that's pretty appealing too.
**Mike**: So what comes with the like their.
**Mike**: What they own?
**Mike**: Is it everything?
**Jdawson**: Basically everything in this, in this square here?
**Jdawson**: Correct?
**Bclymer**: Correct.
**Bclymer**: So this is, it was an asset purchase.
**Bclymer**: They're 25 and a half million and so the land is not included.
**Bclymer**: It's on a 99 year land lease.
**Jdawson**: Which means can't leverage it, right?
**Bclymer**: Correct.
**Bclymer**: But you can leverage the assets.
**Jdawson**: I say.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that's.
**Jdawson**: So I guess what's your guys's thoughts for funding this thing?
**Bclymer**: A couple of paths that I've got gone down.
**Bclymer**: I did talk to Paul about this.
**Bclymer**: When she called me on this, I was at the derby with him.
**Bclymer**: So I went back to the box and we started talking about it.
**Bclymer**: He was, he was remotely interested.
**Bclymer**: Based on the information I had at that time and what I was able to share with him.
**Bclymer**: He said he wouldn't come in this alone, he'd want to bring a hedge fund with him.
**Bclymer**: So that's, that's option one.
**Bclymer**: Option two is a group that Northstar Group.
**Bclymer**: I think I may mention this to you, Brandon.
**Bclymer**: They just got funding for, for a.
**Bclymer**: OR that they're working with a development team that got funding for two and a half billion dollars on a, a project up in New Jersey.
**Bclymer**: It's from this group that's, that's kind of cloak and dagger.
**Bclymer**: They think it's Bill Gates who's funding it.
**Bclymer**: It has to have a sustainability play to it, which is fine.
**Bclymer**: We could put solar all over this place.
**Bclymer**: It would make good sense.
**Bclymer**: And battery storage and everything else.
**Bclymer**: I'm not worried about that.
**Bclymer**: Minimum size project has to be $100 million, which I think we checked that box here and 6% interest, no money out of pocket, nothing down, no personal guarantees.
**Bclymer**: So that's kind of my, that's my number one.
**Bclymer**: We're supposed to be having a call with them later this week.
**Bclymer**: And then the third option, which we're trying to get this guy on the horn, there's A gentleman by the name of John Clinkhammer who resides in Gilbert, just adjacent to.
**Bclymer**: To this area.
**Bclymer**: I've met with him a few times.
**Bclymer**: Phil knows him pretty well.
**Bclymer**: He.
**Bclymer**: He runs some things.
**Bclymer**: He would be interested in funding the residential pieces of this that we do.
**Bclymer**: But even more importantly, is a good friend of his.
**Bclymer**: Was the backup bidder when Chad bought this.
**Bclymer**: He came in at like, 23 and a half, 24 million on this.
**Bclymer**: So we're trying to get access to this guy to see if he'd still want to come back in in some capacity as a financier for this, because clearly he had interest, you know, less than two years ago, and he had the.
**Bclymer**: The capital to do so.
**Jdawson**: So the thought is, so they purchased the asset for 25 million.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: Free and clear.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: And then went around and leveraged it for 50 million or whatever.
**Jdawson**: 75, 100 million.
**Jdawson**: And so now they've got that leverage on it, Correct?
**Bclymer**: That's correct.
**Jdawson**: And so the.
**Jdawson**: The thought is, come in here and offer them 25 million for what they bought it for, but then they still own that leverage, don't they?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, the leverage it was 20 million.
**Jdawson**: Oh, and 20.
**Bclymer**: Okay, 20.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And she.
**Bclymer**: She said that that's been parlayed into something else so we can get them out of this.
**Bclymer**: I'm not sure what that's been parlayed into it.
**Bclymer**: You know, some of this she's privy to, and some of it she's not.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And, you know, we're playing with information we normally wouldn't have if we were just kind of calling them out of the blue.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Bclymer**: So that allows us to game plan and be a little bit more strategic.
**Bclymer**: We're dealing with a narcissist who.
**Bclymer**: His reputation and ego are more important than anything.
**Bclymer**: So he's looking for a lifeline, but isn't too proud to say he's looking for a lifeline.
**Bclymer**: So we're gonna have to show the lifeline without saying it.
**Bclymer**: So that's what I talked to Brandon about, Jesse.
**Bclymer**: One, I.
**Bclymer**: I want to keep separation because I'm already in business with these folks.
**Bclymer**: So if something doesn't go well, and I don't want the sports bar to take a hit or get sideways or we, you know, lose our.
**Bclymer**: Our agreement with them, you know, because this.
**Bclymer**: This didn't work out.
**Bclymer**: So that's why I kind of wanted, you know, someone else to come in, be the front of this for.
**Bclymer**: For.
**Bclymer**: For them.
**Jdawson**: And.
**Bclymer**: And I think in a strategic way, say, you know, hey, we're Interested in this?
**Bclymer**: Want to see what your, your, your goals are here?
**Bclymer**: Brandon had the idea kind of thing, you know, coming in and playing as, you know, the construction side of it.
**Bclymer**: If they're going to develop it and just kind of putting a crack in the, the door a little bit for them to take it a bit, a bit further with, you know, us taking it down.
**Jdawson**: So this guy, the, the head honcho, the narcissist, I mean, do we have his cell phone?
**Jdawson**: Or like, am I, you know, you just want me to cold call him?
**Bclymer**: We can cold call him, we can email him.
**Bclymer**: I've got his email.
**Bclymer**: I can get his cell phone.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I would say, I mean, I don't know, I guess, let me know.
**Jdawson**: I mean, what do you think?
**Jdawson**: I mean, you're, you're more averse to this.
**Jdawson**: My, my thought is phone call first, you know, because, I mean, who reads, you know, emails from random people?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: What do you think?
**Bclymer**: I think a phone call first.
**Bclymer**: My question I'm going to ask Meg this is, is it best to go through the office?
**Bclymer**: Because I think we're playing this kind of like you like this, in this, this property.
**Bclymer**: How would you go about that if you didn't have the information that we have?
**Bclymer**: Would you really have his cell phone number?
**Bclymer**: Probably not.
**Jdawson**: So I, I, I actually, I am really good about finding people.
**Jdawson**: Like, so prime example, gpc, which is a parts thing project in Harrisburg.
**Jdawson**: I got a lead, like an email, right?
**Jdawson**: Hey, like this guy Sam, he wants to talk to you about, blah, blah.
**Jdawson**: Like, all I know is his first name, last name and where he works.
**Jdawson**: And so I looked him up, found him, and I used this thing called Rocket Reach and I got a cell phone.
**Jdawson**: Oh, texted him, called him like, so I find people's numbers, it's not impossible.
**Jdawson**: And that's the thing, like, people always ask, how'd you get my number?
**Jdawson**: Be like, dude, I, I built buildings for a living.
**Jdawson**: Getting numbers, the easiest thing I do.
**Bclymer**: Perfect.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I think phone outreach is the way to go.
**Jdawson**: So, okay, so, so, you know, we'll get his number and I'll give him a shout here and you know, hey, what's his name again?
**Bclymer**: Chad.
**Jdawson**: Hey, Chad.
**Jdawson**: You don't know who I am, you know, but I'm looking at your like, it's Legacy park, right?
**Jdawson**: Or no, it's Arizona Athletic.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, Legacy was the old group.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jdawson**: Looking at your Arizona Athletic, you know, I realized that there's a bunch of ground around the sports complex.
**Jdawson**: You know, we're a design build firm Are you planning on developing that?
**Jdawson**: Like, if so, I, you know, like to partner with you and, you know, turn that into something or something along those lines.
**Jdawson**: What do you think?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I think that's fine.
**Jdawson**: And then he's either saying if he.
**Bclymer**: Hems and haws and, and everything, then I think that, you know, if you're not sure what you're, you know, what.
**Bclymer**: What are you thinking of doing with the land if you're not going to develop it?
**Bclymer**: Would.
**Bclymer**: Would you guys be looking to exit.
**Bclymer**: I know you just bought in about 18 months ago, but, yeah, that'd be a conversation we'd be open to having.
**Bclymer**: So kind of give him two outlets.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jdawson**: See what he says.
**Jdawson**: There I go.
**Jdawson**: You know, I don't know, maybe it's like.
**Jdawson**: Or if he just is like, no, we're not interested.
**Jdawson**: To be like, all right, well, you know, if you're not going to develop it, like, would you be interested in, you know, selling it?
**Jdawson**: You know, I guess some of the developers maybe.
**Jdawson**: Like, that interests you at all.
**Jdawson**: And see what he says.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Would you have a question, Jesse?
**Mike**: So this is Glendale, Arizona, outside of Phoenix.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Isn't that right?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: Right in the Valley.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Mike**: Do we have any idea, like, further census.
**Mike**: Are they expanding?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, Mesa is one of the fastest growing, fast cities in the country.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, it's all, It's.
**Jdawson**: So here's Scottsdale.
**Jdawson**: Like, it's all.
**Jdawson**: This is all Phoenix.
**Jdawson**: Right?
**Jdawson**: Like, it's just.
**Bclymer**: They're all.
**Bclymer**: They're all together.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah, it's just one.
**Bclymer**: Tempe, Gilbert, Mesa, Chandler.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, It's, It's.
**Jdawson**: It's the only place that people live in Arizona.
**Jdawson**: Everybody lives in Phoenix.
**Jdawson**: But, yeah, I mean, you can see.
**Jdawson**: I mean, just looking at this map, I mean, there's a.
**Jdawson**: There's a spot right here that's simply cut out.
**Jdawson**: So, I mean, you're, you're, you're in the right way to.
**Jdawson**: To make those two ends meet.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: And Mesa is the 13th fastest growing city in the country.
**Mike**: Really?
**Jdawson**: Is it.
**Jdawson**: What, what's flying in and out of here?
**Jdawson**: Anything big or is it all small?
**Bclymer**: No, no, there's.
**Bclymer**: I mean, we fly in there from Cincinnati direct.
**Jdawson**: Oh, wow.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So it's, It's, It's a.
**Jdawson**: It's an airport.
**Bclymer**: Oh, yeah.
**Jdawson**: Who flies direct from Cincinnati to Mesa?
**Jdawson**: Spirit.
**Bclymer**: Allegiant.
**Jdawson**: Allegiant.
**Jdawson**: Same thing.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Your ass hurts by the time you.
**Jdawson**: Get there, but, yeah, you gotta pay extra so you don't have to pedal.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, but I've Seen American come in and out of there.
**Bclymer**: I've seen some plans, too, about expansion, like growing that airport out a bit, too, just to take some relief off of Phoenix.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I mean, it looks like they, you know, they got some room.
**Jdawson**: I mean, this doesn't look like anything.
**Bclymer**: No.
**Jdawson**: All right, so.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, so, okay.
**Jdawson**: So, you know, hey, you know, yes, we're interested.
**Jdawson**: And then what?
**Jdawson**: I.
**Jdawson**: I guess, you know, kind of my thoughts.
**Jdawson**: Go ahead, Jesse.
**Mike**: I'm saying, like, now we're next to an airport.
**Mike**: Is this all height restricted throughout this whole thing?
**Mike**: I wonder.
**Bclymer**: No, not.
**Bclymer**: They've got.
**Bclymer**: I'm sure to some extent.
**Bclymer**: But I mean, the.
**Bclymer**: The poles out on the fields and everything are.
**Bclymer**: I mean, they're north of probably 50, 60ft.
**Bclymer**: I don't think you can go a couple hundred here, but.
**Mike**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: I mean, anything tall would be over here, wouldn't it?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: You're out of the flight path.
**Mike**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I mean, so.
**Jdawson**: So, you know, he's.
**Jdawson**: If he asked, like, what are your ideas or what is this?
**Jdawson**: So we're thinking like hotel, restaurant, food and drink up in this area.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: And then what are you thinking along the back, like more fields or what?
**Jdawson**: Residential.
**Bclymer**: I think I would lean into some residential and then mixed use over on.
**Bclymer**: On the Ellsworth side.
**Bclymer**: That's just two.
**Bclymer**: Primer real estate there.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: What is this here?
**Jdawson**: Anything Where.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, that little building there.
**Bclymer**: That's their.
**Bclymer**: That's their commissary right now, which makes no sense.
**Bclymer**: It's not the commissary.
**Bclymer**: Kitchen's not even connected to the building.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I mean, you could.
**Jdawson**: You could.
**Jdawson**: It doesn't take a ton of space to add that on somewhere.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So putting, you know, I think apartment and everything.
**Jdawson**: I mean, honestly, you could do your commercial here or here.
**Jdawson**: Really?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: And there's so many.
**Jdawson**: Probably better over here, just because all the parking.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I think it ties in a little better.
**Bclymer**: And then with.
**Bclymer**: With 24 and 202 up that way.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: But in this AAU circuit and this select sports, they've got what's called state of play, where you force.
**Bclymer**: If you want to be part of a tournament, you have to stay at these hotels.
**Bclymer**: And I mean, they're missing out on all this.
**Bclymer**: And of course, the rates go up 40.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: You know, it's.
**Bclymer**: It's a racket, but people are paying it well.
**Jdawson**: I mean, youth sports in general is a racket.
**Jdawson**: I mean, that the amount of money that is paid and like, oh, we have a tournament and, you know, San Juan and Then we're gonna go to Mexico City, and we're gonna.
**Jdawson**: It's like, how in the world do you do this?
**Bclymer**: My.
**Bclymer**: My son played in a tournament this weekend.
**Bclymer**: They beat this team 62 to 9.
**Bclymer**: That team that we beat beat somebody by 50 the night before.
**Bclymer**: So it tells you the horrible.
**Bclymer**: And they're not an AAU team like it should be for the elevated athlete.
**Bclymer**: But people want to go to Facebook and say that their son or daughter plays aau, so they'll pay for it.
**Jdawson**: Wow.
**Bclymer**: And they'll fly all over the country for this.
**Bclymer**: So is this soccer?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So this is the largest turf complex in the country.
**Bclymer**: That's all.
**Bclymer**: All those are turf fields, 24 of them.
**Bclymer**: And then they have the largest pickleball complex in the country.
**Bclymer**: And that's right under Legacy avenue right there.
**Bclymer**: 41 courts.
**Bclymer**: And then what?
**Bclymer**: That little white building there is center court.
**Bclymer**: So they host.
**Bclymer**: Anytime pickleball's on espn, it's usually there where that green dot is.
**Jdawson**: How in the world are they not making money?
**Bclymer**: I.
**Bclymer**: It's unbelievable.
**Bclymer**: Brandon.
**Bclymer**: She.
**Bclymer**: She had Pepsi at the table.
**Bclymer**: I don't know what the sponsorship amount was or what they were trying to do.
**Bclymer**: They started dealing with ownership because they don't allow her, as the president, to do anything.
**Bclymer**: Once it turned over to ownership, Pepsi came back and said, off, unquote, off.
**Bclymer**: I have Pepsi throwing money at me for Liberty Collective.
**Bclymer**: Throwing money.
**Bclymer**: They're just unrealistic idiots.
**Bclymer**: But, you know, I think he's trying to dig his way out of these holes, so.
**Bclymer**: But, I mean, they would do naming rights all over the place.
**Bclymer**: I think you could sell out components of this.
**Bclymer**: Like, you could just push the baseball side over to, like, Ripken Baseball or what is that, pbr?
**Bclymer**: And just allow them to come in and they can.
**Bclymer**: They can own the fields kind of thing for X amount of year.
**Bclymer**: You don't have to worry about it.
**Bclymer**: There's just a lot that could be done here.
**Bclymer**: But they're not into the operations of it, so.
**Bclymer**: So she is, but she's got her hands tied.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I mean, it just.
**Jdawson**: You're right.
**Jdawson**: I mean, it just at that, you know, I mean, 25 million is a lot of money, but it doesn't seem like a lot for this.
**Bclymer**: No, no.
**Bclymer**: 50 indoor volleyball courts.
**Bclymer**: 50.
**Bclymer**: There was a mini hospital built in here.
**Bclymer**: It's in the scale of this.
**Bclymer**: It looks small.
**Bclymer**: It is massive.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: How many acres is it, do you know?
**Bclymer**: I think it was like 288.
**Jdawson**: Damn.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I mean.
**Jdawson**: And so basically, Because I'm just trying to think like, so if, if I call this guy and he says, yeah, yeah, we are thinking about, you know, we are looking at development, you know, but we, you know, we don't need a contractor.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: We don't need this.
**Jdawson**: Like, you know, then my, I guess my thought is like, oh, really?
**Jdawson**: Would you have funding?
**Jdawson**: Because, you know, I mean, it looks like, you know, you bought this thing on a discount, but, you know, numbers aren't reflecting what you thought they would maybe or something like that, but you know what I mean, to like, hit like, you know, do you have.
**Jdawson**: Because at the end of the day it sounds like this guy's such an.
**Jdawson**: Nobody would want to give him funding anyway.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Or maybe on the other side of it, say, you know, were you looking for a partner or, you know, because we're funded to go and, and we're working with some groups that are already fun.
**Bclymer**: They like the youth sports component in growing markets and use me as an example, Brandon.
**Bclymer**: And not by name, but say we're dealing with one right now.
**Bclymer**: That's, that's right in the grand park area of, of Indianapolis, if you're familiar with that.
**Bclymer**: He probably isn't because he doesn't know.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, he's only been to this site here twice in 18 months.
**Jdawson**: And where's the.
**Jdawson**: Out of California.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: LA.
**Jdawson**: So it's an afternoon call.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: What.
**Jdawson**: What else do you think that, you know, I guess ammo or what should I cover?
**Jdawson**: What should I avoid?
**Jdawson**: That's a better question.
**Bclymer**: I think just be careful on, on what information you share.
**Bclymer**: Just kind of continue to remind yourself of.
**Bclymer**: If you were really, truly cold calling this dude, what information would you have?
**Bclymer**: Just do an Internet search or, or anything else, which I know you, you'll be careful there, but I.
**Mike**: How is it that you would have found this, Brandon?
**Jdawson**: How would I have found the ground?
**Mike**: Well, this was a thing that he possibly would want to get rid of.
**Jdawson**: Well, so in general, you know, I would say it's like, hey, we're doing multiple developments around sports complexes.
**Jdawson**: You know, it's.
**Jdawson**: I don't know if you've ever heard of, of Grand Park.
**Jdawson**: It's the largest youth sports complex, you know, in the Midwest.
**Jdawson**: And so we specialize in, in development around these markets.
**Jdawson**: Noticed this transaction around 18 months ago.
**Jdawson**: Haven't seen any movement on the ground.
**Jdawson**: Wanted to see if you were interested in developing around it or not.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I like that.
**Bclymer**: And you know, they just announced that, that, that master plan at grand park three or four months Ago.
**Bclymer**: I mean, you can really lean into that.
**Bclymer**: You don't need to give any names, but you're.
**Bclymer**: You're incredibly active in that.
**Bclymer**: He doesn't need to know.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jdawson**: I mean, because again, everything that I just said in that is all public record.
**Jdawson**: Like, you know, look it up.
**Jdawson**: You know.
**Bclymer**: That's exactly right.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: And it's.
**Jdawson**: And it's.
**Jdawson**: And honestly, it's exactly what.
**Jdawson**: What we do.
**Jdawson**: Like, what I do do.
**Jdawson**: Like, if I'm trying to find an owner, I'll go dig through and find out through the Secretary of State, you know, who owns it, tax records, and then get on there.
**Jdawson**: As soon as I find a name, research them, get their number.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: It's nothing anybody else doesn't do.
**Mike**: Two million dollar fence running around this place.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I know, right?
**Jdawson**: That's crazy.
**Bclymer**: We went.
**Bclymer**: She took me.
**Bclymer**: She'd only been there a couple months when I first met her.
**Bclymer**: And my first visit out here.
**Bclymer**: And we're opening closets.
**Bclymer**: There was a big cryogenics machine in.
**Bclymer**: In one.
**Bclymer**: They're like, oh, look at that.
**Bclymer**: And we opened another door.
**Bclymer**: You know those handheld massagers?
**Bclymer**: There must have been three or four hundred of them, brand new, in boxes stacked to the ceiling.
**Bclymer**: The.
**Bclymer**: That they bought here.
**Bclymer**: It's.
**Bclymer**: I mean, it.
**Bclymer**: The.
**Bclymer**: The complex is really.
**Bclymer**: It's gorgeous.
**Jdawson**: Talk about the.
**Jdawson**: The original owners bought that, right?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah, I think it was 300 million.
**Mike**: What?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So if you go up just a little bit more, you'll see the main entrance a little bit further up.
**Jdawson**: I see it right there.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, right here.
**Bclymer**: And then.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, right there is kind of where you go where the flags are at.
**Bclymer**: Those are the executive offices right there where it says Arizona Grounds.
**Bclymer**: And then if you keep going down, you'll hit what used to be called Miller Light Way.
**Bclymer**: And then they just pulled that out.
**Bclymer**: Now they're just calling it the Breezeway until they get a sponsorship deal.
**Bclymer**: So everything to the right is all basketball and volleyball courts.
**Bclymer**: This area right here.
**Jdawson**: Oh, beautiful.
**Bclymer**: So our.
**Bclymer**: Our restaurant is just down here to the left on the corner through Miller Light Way.
**Bclymer**: This used to be a zip line over the course.
**Bclymer**: See the stairs that go up there behind the LED screen?
**Jdawson**: Oh, yeah.
**Bclymer**: They build a zip line in.
**Bclymer**: Nobody even knows that they ever used it.
**Bclymer**: This.
**Bclymer**: This is vacant right now.
**Bclymer**: That corner there where it says, yeah, right here, that is vacant.
**Bclymer**: And then the other side is vacant because we had some plans, we pitched them on.
**Bclymer**: That's vacant too.
**Bclymer**: So you think about revenue streams and things.
**Bclymer**: I mean, there's.
**Bclymer**: There's a lot that can be done here.
**Jdawson**: I tell you what you.
**Jdawson**: What I think might.
**Jdawson**: I don't know.
**Jdawson**: I mean, you know, it might want to pencil it out.
**Jdawson**: Just an idea.
**Jdawson**: If you've got an area that has a, you know, you have some empty space like an arcade.
**Jdawson**: And now the only way it's going to make money, obviously, like you can make some money with the kids not playing, but then if there's a rain delay, you can make a fortune because they go in there and you know, play video games or whatever, you know, arcades or, you know, obviously if, if there's, if there's beverage, you know, you can sell beer somewhere, then that, that'll do even better.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: If you can, you know, justify it with the.
**Jdawson**: The need.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Mike**: And is there any, you know, looking at this area, like, is there any money to be made with like the motocross like dirt bike type little mini tracks?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I saw those trails too.
**Jdawson**: I was thinking the same thing.
**Mike**: Just that whole maybe, maybe that side there, that's you know, right in the flight path, you know.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I don't know that business model at all.
**Bclymer**: But I mean that's where you go to like a Red Bull.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Bclymer**: And.
**Bclymer**: And you do a whole spot like a well thought out strategy around it.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I caught the Red Bull test.
**Jdawson**: Test track.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: You know, they come out there, they're always doing cool stuff, blah, blah, blah.
**Jdawson**: Like it makes sense.
**Jdawson**: And it also.
**Jdawson**: I.
**Jdawson**: I would think if I'm Red Bull, it legitimizes it as a sport because it's with other sports.
**Bclymer**: Correct.
**Mike**: That almost looks like a formula one track with the curves and straight away.
**Jdawson**: It'S, it's, it's odd.
**Jdawson**: I noticed that I didn built like this.
**Bclymer**: Well, Megan, I had a discussion the other day about what?
**Bclymer**: About building a spring training facility for.
**Jdawson**: One of the teams like the Diamondbacks or something.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Well, they've got what about 15 teams that come out here into that general area.
**Jdawson**: Oh, wow.
**Mike**: Yeah, they all the northern cold weather teams come south for spring.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: This is the Cactus League.
**Bclymer**: And then our.
**Jdawson**: Another smart.
**Bclymer**: Our restaurant is right at the end of the walkway.
**Bclymer**: So if you zoom in a tick more.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: See Bristol's.
**Bclymer**: That's ours.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Mike**: And like do each like different sport has a different season.
**Mike**: Right.
**Mike**: So if you could combine one of kind of each season, you'd almost guarantee yourself always having.
**Jdawson**: Well, these don't have seasons.
**Jdawson**: This AAU stuff.
**Jdawson**: They play year round, right?
**Bclymer**: That's right.
**Bclymer**: It's year round.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Now you're gonna have your.
**Bclymer**: Your June, July and August.
**Bclymer**: Everything's got to be inside.
**Bclymer**: It's too hot.
**Bclymer**: So they're getting real creative on what they're doing.
**Bclymer**: They're turning Fieldhouse C.
**Bclymer**: The whole month of July is like a trampoline.
**Bclymer**: Park is coming in there now, fitting Field House C, which is down Miller Light Ways.
**Bclymer**: It's the building at the bottom left here of your.
**Bclymer**: Or the very bottom building.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: That's Field House C.
**Bclymer**: B is where it says Bell bank park, and then Field House A is the one above it.
**Bclymer**: So that's just what, as you think about, there is seasonality here, but there's, like, hardly any solar at all on this.
**Bclymer**: This complex.
**Bclymer**: All that roof space.
**Bclymer**: There's no solar.
**Bclymer**: We could do carports across the entire parking lot.
**Bclymer**: If we go down that sustainability route where we have to, there's plenty of that to be had.
**Jdawson**: These things right here.
**Bclymer**: That's it.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Complex, this size, you got like 10 solar panels.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, that's a little stadium right there.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I mean, you know, again, once you get the.
**Jdawson**: The food and beverage and hotels and stuff and everything, I mean.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: You can also piggyback and do a.
**Jdawson**: A concert thing.
**Bclymer**: Absolutely.
**Bclymer**: So this is how they operate, because I.
**Bclymer**: First time I talked to them, they were selling me on all this.
**Bclymer**: Oh, we have Gene Simmons on board as our music director.
**Bclymer**: We're going to be doing concerts and everything else.
**Bclymer**: Well, it's all.
**Bclymer**: There's just.
**Bclymer**: There's so much opportunity.
**Bclymer**: I'm glad you guys have seen it the way we.
**Bclymer**: We see.
**Bclymer**: We just.
**Bclymer**: Wow.
**Bclymer**: It's almost like a blank canvas.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I mean, It's.
**Bclymer**: I mean, 3 million visitors a year right now.
**Jdawson**: If you can get.
**Jdawson**: If you can get that loan.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: 6%, 0% down.
**Jdawson**: Like, I mean, at that point, you should probably buy a jet.
**Jdawson**: You're just.
**Jdawson**: That's a great deal.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Well, you can even afford to overpay if you had to.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, absolutely.
**Bclymer**: You got that kind of financing on the back end.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: 6%, 0% down.
**Jdawson**: Your ROI is.
**Jdawson**: I mean.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: If you can.
**Jdawson**: If you can leverage that, then you bring other investors to the table.
**Jdawson**: Holy cow.
**Bclymer**: So pitching this whole thing around this sustainable sports and entertainment facility.
**Bclymer**: Nothing's like that in the country.
**Bclymer**: So whoever.
**Bclymer**: If it's Bill Gates or whoever's funding all this stuff, that's got to be appealing because it's going to generate a lot of press and.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I mean, I would think it would be.
**Jdawson**: Again, I mean, the.
**Jdawson**: A.
**Jdawson**: The first the country, and it not only plays to the sustainability part, but it's, you know, serving the youth.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Mike**: You know, Arizona State University has.
**Mike**: They call it over there.
**Jdawson**: The suspense is killing me.
**Jdawson**: What you say, Jesse, you froze.
**Mike**: I said Arizona State has a university right there next to the airport.
**Mike**: You could even build some student housing.
**Mike**: Like if you were looking at.
**Jdawson**: Honestly.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I'll go recruit.
**Jdawson**: I'll take that burden.
**Bclymer**: You can have that campus.
**Jdawson**: I'll.
**Bclymer**: I'll.
**Bclymer**: I'll take the main campus.
**Bclymer**: We.
**Bclymer**: We took my son there for a visit a few weeks ago, and they ended the tour through the athletic or like a.
**Bclymer**: The gym.
**Bclymer**: It's kind of almost about the size of a Planet Fitness.
**Bclymer**: And then you come out to this pool area and they had.
**Bclymer**: There's.
**Bclymer**: There's probably 50 girls in bikinis at the pool.
**Bclymer**: And we walk alongside all of them through as they're exiting out.
**Bclymer**: And I'm thinking this was very strategic.
**Mike**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: And I had, I had three boys with me that all now have Arizona State as number one on their list.
**Jdawson**: I mean, they're, they're geniuses.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: They do have a good working relationship with asu.
**Bclymer**: In fact, ASU contacted them the other day.
**Bclymer**: She said, because they've got Bayern Munich, the, The soccer team in Germany has like a feeder program here in the states that they want to partner with Arizona State, and they need a complex, and they need a complex that has housing.
**Mike**: There you go.
**Bclymer**: So they're fielding calls and stuff like that, but they're limited because they don't have any of this stuff around it.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I mean, that you're.
**Jdawson**: That is a great call.
**Jdawson**: You know, that's a great play for your residential.
**Jdawson**: Because when you said residential.
**Jdawson**: Just my reservation, which is just, you know, my opinion.
**Jdawson**: Your.
**Jdawson**: You're more a real estate guy than I am, is.
**Jdawson**: Is putting houses down here.
**Jdawson**: Almost.
**Jdawson**: Almost feels.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, exactly.
**Jdawson**: Almost feels like a waste.
**Jdawson**: Like you could only use maybe like this area because nobody wants lights and traffic and all that stuff.
**Jdawson**: Like, you know, I, I think.
**Jdawson**: But if you do again, do a hotel, you might even do a couple hotels and then temporary housing.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: So just basically mixed use, like dormitory type, you know.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Then that's a, That's a huge win, you know, Especially if you do like a dormitory, you know, and it's actually like higher end, so you got a nice pool, all that kind of stuff to where it's.
**Jdawson**: It's not just like, you know, going to, like when I was a kid going to like shitty football camp.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Well, you don't have ac.
**Jdawson**: Like, this is actually nice.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, exactly.
**Bclymer**: And those, they've.
**Bclymer**: They've got a, A fitness area in here that is like second to none.
**Bclymer**: It's awesome.
**Bclymer**: They're charging people, like locals, like 10 bucks a month right now.
**Bclymer**: So you just build that in as an amenity to this, you know, who's ever coming into this temporary housing.
**Bclymer**: And these, there's the, the multi family stuff we would do.
**Mike**: Well, I don't know that student housing, you make about triple what multifamily does.
**Mike**: Yeah, because they have like five rooms.
**Mike**: They share a kitchen, living room and that.
**Mike**: And then they charge each room 800amonth.
**Mike**: So they're getting like four grand a month or something.
**Mike**: That's 1500, you know, as a single apartment.
**Jdawson**: Well, and, and you're talking about, Jesse, the student housing for, you know, for a campus year.
**Jdawson**: I think what Mike was alluding to is that when, when they come for like a field Camper and AAU.
**Jdawson**: So you're talking three months now.
**Jdawson**: Just add 30% to that number for temporary housing because now it's furnished and all that stuff.
**Mike**: Yeah, well, too for things like that.
**Mike**: If it's a team coming in, that same concept would work where they, they're sharing a living room, but they got five separate bedrooms with each, you know, their own bathroom.
**Jdawson**: Oh, yeah, it would, it would be the same, same, you know, setup.
**Jdawson**: I'm just saying your revenue would be even higher.
**Bclymer**: Yes, because.
**Jdawson**: Because it's a shorter time period and it's furnished.
**Jdawson**: But yes, it would be.
**Jdawson**: You're exactly right on the design.
**Jdawson**: It would be exactly that.
**Bclymer**: Well, what you're seeing too is families are coming in and it'll be multiple teammates.
**Bclymer**: They want a condo or something that's larger.
**Bclymer**: Because a lot of times you're flying out here or you got to take a Friday off.
**Bclymer**: Not all the parents can go.
**Bclymer**: So one parent may take three or four kids.
**Bclymer**: This way you got rooms, but everybody's still kind of under one roof.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, it's really endless possibilities here.
**Bclymer**: And with the retail we could build in there, the mixed use and then the, the food and Bev as part of it too.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I mean, the.
**Jdawson**: I think also, you know, as you look into to training facilities and for.
**Jdawson**: For pro sports.
**Jdawson**: You mentioned that the gym with, you know, like you could actually build.
**Jdawson**: I don't know what, like how big it is or whatever, but like an actual, even, you know, bigger, huge, like state of the art that's going to be used for, that's going to attract those pro athletes.
**Jdawson**: That come train there and everything.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: And then.
**Jdawson**: And then you can.
**Jdawson**: Then you can open it up to the public as well.
**Jdawson**: But instead of $10, it's, you know, a thousand, you know, so you can say, oh, I.
**Jdawson**: I work out at the same place as, you know, so and so.
**Bclymer**: Sure.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Because there's nothing.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Gym club.
**Jdawson**: That's the only one that's.
**Jdawson**: That's this place.
**Jdawson**: The fitness center at Bell Bell bank park, it looks like.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: But outside of that, there's.
**Jdawson**: There's not.
**Jdawson**: I mean, no real gems.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: I mean, there's a few of them down there in.
**Jdawson**: To the south, but nothing.
**Jdawson**: I don't, you know, I don't see an equinox.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Nothing crazy.
**Bclymer**: No.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so what else do we need to know, if anything?
**Bclymer**: I think I've shared the important stuff.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: I'll.
**Jdawson**: I'll kind of said I've got all these notes and everything, so I'll review it and I'll, you know, I'll get a little cheat sheet and everything put together and then.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: If you can get the guy's number, then I'll give him a shout.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: You know, tomorrow, Wednesday, whenever we can do it and kind of go from there and just.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: See if he bites.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I think right now it's about bait the hook and see if we can set it.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Especially again if he's losing money hand over fist and needs to unload this thing.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Cool.
**Jdawson**: You switching gears here?
**Jdawson**: Did you send that loi to Dennis or.
**Bclymer**: I.
**Bclymer**: I talked to Tad today.
**Bclymer**: He reviewed it.
**Bclymer**: He liked it a lot, so it's going over to him this afternoon.
**Jdawson**: Nice.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: Perfect.
**Jdawson**: And then for the.
**Jdawson**: For Seminole, we're waiting on them to get us a topo.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Survey.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: The only thing that they asked for us, and we may need that before is they.
**Bclymer**: They need to know exactly for the legal docs, how much land we're asking for for the land lease.
**Jdawson**: Well, we have to.
**Jdawson**: We need their.
**Jdawson**: To that survey to.
**Jdawson**: To lay it out.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: I've given them some estimates and things that really.
**Bclymer**: To have it, you know, to go into a legal document.
**Bclymer**: We don't have what we need yet, so.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, you gotta.
**Jdawson**: I mean, right, Jesse, we can't just scale that.
**Mike**: We'd have to actually survey it to know what that is.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Which they should already have.
**Mike**: Yeah, but did.
**Mike**: Are they surveying, though?
**Mike**: Splitting it up like we showed.
**Mike**: We send them like a rough.
**Mike**: Like a rough.
**Mike**: Just a.
**Bclymer**: No, I don't think they're surveying it.
**Bclymer**: Based on that, they're surveying the entire parcel.
**Mike**: My video off.
**Jdawson**: No, it.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, but just.
**Jdawson**: Even if they survey it like that, Jesse, then all we got to do is just go in and take that survey, convert it into a site plan, and then we can, you know, do a takeoff.
**Jdawson**: Here's how much the parking lot is.
**Jdawson**: Here's the volleyball.
**Jdawson**: Here's the rest of it.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Mike**: But.
**Mike**: But I'm just asking if it's.
**Mike**: If it.
**Mike**: If they're asking for a square foot of land that we're taking over, like, that's something.
**Mike**: A surveyor has to come up with that number because it's not just a square.
**Mike**: It's kind of winds all over the place.
**Jdawson**: Well, I mean, I'm sure we can get that.
**Jdawson**: Whoever does there, if they're getting the survey done now, or if it's an old existing one, then we can reach out to that surveying company and have them split it up.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Mike**: Okay.
**Mike**: Yeah.
**Mike**: So that's what we need to do.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: So do we know, Mike, when they're supposed to get that, or do we have any kind of assemblance of a timeline?
**Bclymer**: I was told that on the.
**Bclymer**: The next meeting that's on our books, which is a week from this Wednesday, they will have the topo report, and they will have the draft of the legal documents for us.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And then.
**Jdawson**: Well, a draft of the legal documents, less the correct.
**Bclymer**: A placeholder.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And then for the Georgia one said that site plan.
**Jdawson**: And then assuming he's going to say, okay, whatever, like, are they going to issue an LLI based off that?
**Jdawson**: And then that way we can, you know, start doing a little bit of design to get it through board.
**Bclymer**: I created an LOI and sent it over to them.
**Bclymer**: James gave it its blessing, but it's ultimately Steve.
**Bclymer**: I will follow back up with him because it's in his court right now, but I will follow back up.
**Jdawson**: Okay, and then.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, because then once.
**Jdawson**: Once you get that, then, you know, we can spend a little money on getting some preliminary designs done and everything.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Mike**: Okay, just so we're.
**Mike**: So I'm on the same page here on just opening this up here.
**Jdawson**: Sam.
**Mike**: So this, like, once we get that survey and from the city, we'll have our guy layout this pink as one and the blue is the other.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Mike**: And this.
**Mike**: But then this road through the back, this access road, these easements, like we're staying, like, will that belong to you, or is this, like, them?
**Mike**: This will belong to them.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Mike**: And the pink belongs to them.
**Bclymer**: And the parking lot Jesse in the.
**Mike**: Parking lot down here.
**Bclymer**: That's them?
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: All that shitty soil.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Mike**: All right, I'll talk to our civil engineer and see if I'll find out exactly what we need to do to get that exact.
**Mike**: Okay, get that split up so that when we're ready to pull the trigger, he'll be ready to go.
**Bclymer**: Great.
**Mike**: All right.
**Bclymer**: Good deal.
**Bclymer**: I'll.
**Bclymer**: I'll get that phone number for you.
**Bclymer**: Brandon, let me know as you're kind of game plan and putting your.
**Bclymer**: Your notes together if you need to talk through anything.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I'll get stuff together, and I'll, you know, let you know what I'm thinking and make sure we're on the same page.
**Bclymer**: Okay, cool.
**Jdawson**: Thanks, guys.
**Bclymer**: Good.
**Bclymer**: Gentlemen.
**Bclymer**: Appreciate it.
**Mike**: All right.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: See you guys.
