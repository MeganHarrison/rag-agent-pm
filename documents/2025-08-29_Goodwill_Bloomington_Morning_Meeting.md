## Transcript

**Jesse Dawson:**
What's up, Jesse? R. You make it home? 

**Jesse Remillard:**
No. Two flight delays. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
What? 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yeah. 

**Nick Jepson:**
Did you make it back? 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Midnight. Really? 

**Jesse Dawson:**
What? 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Yeah, yeah, I got the first flight delay about a half hour after I left the site. And then when I got to the airport, I got the second one. You can't fix a break, not on this fucking ship. 

**Nick Jepson:**
Oh, who, who are you flying with? 

**Jesse Remillard:**
American. It was something that happened out in the Southeast or the Southwest because the two flights that got delayed were coming from la. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Okay. 

**Nick Jepson:**
And my last fight with American got delayed as well. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Yeah, mine made the news. Oh, there was a picture. There was a picture on the news of part of the roof that tore off the airport when I was sitting on the plane in Phoenix waiting out that storm. And the picture was of the gate right to the left of me. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
It ripped the roof off? 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Yeah, it ripped part of the roof off the roof of the airport. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Holy shit. Was it a hurt like a tornado or. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Well, it was a. It was a haboob that was followed by a monsoon that had micro bursts with it. So it was a giant sandstorm then when it was a giant rainstorm with little mini tornadoes. Summer's weather season. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Here. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Is Jack joining us? I'll give a. 

**Nick Jepson:**
Give him a call. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
And I pulled something out there. Don't try to lift a 12 inch bollard full of concrete. 

**Nick Jepson:**
Hey, Jack, are you gonna get on the column? 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yes. 

**Nick Jepson:**
Okay. 

**Jack Curtin:**
All right. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
He. 

**Nick Jepson:**
He said he's gonna get on, on the call. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Okay. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Hey, Jack. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Hey. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Sorry, I was on the phone. How's the pavement look? 

**Jack Curtin:**
Looks good, looks good. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Are they coming to stripe today? 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yes. That's what, that's what they mentioned this morning that they were going to still come out. He didn't give me exact time yet. All right, so can you send me. Pull out the sheets that are relevant. Send me that. And also thought I had an assignment. 

**Nick Jepson:**
Are you able to work things out with the EPIS check? 

**Jack Curtin:**
No, I'm not. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
What do you need? 

**Jack Curtin:**
So the original plan was that they would be able to do the canopy because when they were doing the perimeter EFIs, they were going to. So it was supposed to be set up where they were going to be working the exterior of the building and installing the ethos there. And then it would flow right into then working at the canopy. But then we had that hump of the delay with the whole columns being poured and they had to demobilize and go to a different job site. And now they can't come back to school weekend, but they can come back Wednesday either. Tuesday or Wednesday. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Is the ES part of the tco. 

**Jack Curtin:**
The ES shouldn't delay the CCO at all. The only thing that it would inhibit is just coordination with Goodwill. Next week when they do Deliverance, which told me that. Can you hear me? Yeah. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Andrew's deliveries, you said? 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yes. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Okay. 

**Jack Curtin:**
He's got some deliveries at the. At the canopy next week, but he said it shouldn't be that much. He's working on exact dates and everything is going to be dropped off today. He said, let me know on what they. What they want to drop off next week and the week of the 8th. He's working on that today day. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Did he say anything about that energized pallet jack? 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yes, he said that it could just be plugged in, and then I verified and found the. The prong plug in for it. So we're good there. We don't need an EV station or nothing. Okay, good. Serial number and everything. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
And then what about the sprinkler line and the canopy? 

**Jack Curtin:**
I'm waiting for Tim Clapp, the fire marshal to get back with me. He's supposed to give me. That's a humidity issue. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
It's hard to hear with your background noise. But did you. Did you know about that sprinkler line up in the canopy? 

**Jesse Dawson:**
What. What sprinkler line? 

**Jesse Remillard:**
There's a sprinkler line that runs out into the canopy in the exterior at the loading. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
How can that be? It freezes out there. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Exactly. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
It. It's a sidewall head, Jack. It doesn't go up in the ceiling. It's just a. It's a sidewall head. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yeah. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
So they'll just come down inside and drill a hole through the wall and put the head. Okay, they haven't done that yet? 

**Jack Curtin:**
No, not yet. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
I'm guessing you didn't have them sleeve it. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Not yet. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Well, there's no yet. The block's done, so. 

**Nick Jepson:**
We have to. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Get guys because that may. I mean, you're getting a tco. I don't know if that'll hold you up, especially if the fire marshals there. 

**Jack Curtin:**
I didn't. I guess I missed that. Where. So. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Yeah, we're gonna have to get that. 

**Nick Jepson:**
Need to find someone that can core drill. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
It's just a small line. They can do that with a hammer drill, whatever. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Yeah, anybody should be able to have that access to that equipment. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Well, the fire sprinkler guy owes it. Like, he needs to come out here with the drill, drill it and put it in. So I would get on the phone with him, like, right now and get his ass out there. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
You got that, Jack? 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yeah. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Okay, and you have his contact info and everything? 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yeah, it's a third party that Siemens hired Vulcan except out the rest of their work. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Okay, and what about the overhead door guy? 

**Jack Curtin:**
They could not fit me in on the weekend, so they said that the. They could do the eighth. And Andrew said that the eighth is fine. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
But can we get a T seal with that? Just boarded up. 

**Jack Curtin:**
We should be able to because that's not part of. Okay. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Yeah, because that pit, everything should be board by then. Nick, have you seen anything from them yet? 

**Jesse Dawson:**
From who? 

**Jesse Remillard:**
The concrete end of United. 

**Nick Jepson:**
They should be mobilizing today. Yeah, they said they'll get it done next week, but paperwork wise. Yeah, we have the change order and we have the subcontract. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Oh, so that cost that was on the change order you sent is their cost? 

**Nick Jepson:**
Yeah, it's their concrete. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Okay. 

**Nick Jepson:**
And site work on the change order. And then their contract was a utility vault and asphalt. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Okay. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
And then I saw Heather emailed, but I haven't opened it yet. 

**Nick Jepson:**
Yeah, Sometime today I'm going to go over the path with Jack and then we'll send him a letter saying like how much we're deducting from their subcontract. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Okay. Yeah. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
And Jack, with that concrete, you're going to want to talk to John the Paver or his foreman and Dylan or whoever they send and make sure about put running concrete over that pavement for those diamonds. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yes. This fire sprinkler. Am I. Am I missing it? I don't. I haven't seen a detail about a sidewall rough in anywhere. There. Is this. Is this just something that we're like planning to do for coverage there? Because the fire marshal told me I didn't need anything underneath the canopy. And I'm wondering what. Why. Why needing any kind of coverage there would change things that. Because the box truck will be. The. The semi will be sitting there. So we need some sort of coverage. 

**Nick Jepson:**
In there when you walk through. He said you don't need one at the canopy? 

**Jack Curtin:**
No, he said as long as nothing was wood underneath there. 

**Nick Jepson:**
Okay, so we're good then. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yeah. Yeah. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
You're talking about the entrance canopy, right, Jack? Not the loading dock. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yeah, the entrance canopy were fine. We didn't. We don't need anything there. But then y' all were talking about putting in a sleeve at the dock door area. Now, since he. Since he didn't want any coverage at the. Underneath the canopy, I. I'm assuming that he's not going to Want any weight? We don't need any coverage underneath the dock door like that little tunnel area. Because all he asked me underneath the canvy was is there going to be any wood in it under there? I said no. And he said, then no, you're fine. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
I'm trying to get plans to load. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Did we get a perm, a shop drawing, set of fire sprinkler drawings? Nick? 

**Nick Jepson:**
Siemens? No, they, they don't give me any information. I asked him, I've sent him an email asking him do we need anything under the loading dock. He never responded. He doesn't send submittals. It was the same thing with bart. He doesn't give me info on permitting. Like, I, I don't think we can work with Siemens anymore on, on these. Oh, I guess he. 

**Jack Curtin:**
But. 

**Nick Jepson:**
Yeah, I'm not sure how to get the information from those guys that's. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
In here that they're required to provide drawings. They didn't have a submittal they sent. 

**Nick Jepson:**
You said no. They, they did the same thing on the last project too. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
So we submitted product data. That's it. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Did we pay them for drawings? 

**Nick Jepson:**
I can read through their contract. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Like. 

**Nick Jepson:**
We really can't work with Siemens again because they don't do any project management. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Where's their executed contract? 

**Nick Jepson:**
It's a attachment under the commitments. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Oh, it's in this attachment folder. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Okay. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Yeah, that's where I am. I thought it was in that executed agreement folder in the bottom. Well, it says it shall be in conformance with plans T111 cover sheet. And that's where it says they're required to submit drawings. 

**Nick Jepson:**
I guess the solution is to reach out to that subcontractor and see what they say. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Yes. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yeah. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
There's this note on the sprinkler heads too, on T111, right? Move or relocate existing heads as required. Provide missing all that stuff. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Jack, did you have the fight? So you've had the fire marshal in there to do the rough in inspections. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
You're muted, Jack. Nick, do you recall seeing on the weekly. 

**Nick Jepson:**
What's that? Jesse? 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Do you recall seeing anything about inspections on a weekly? Jackson phone with the fire marshal right now. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Why are we asking this question before we ask our sub. Why would he bring that up to the fire marshal? 

**Nick Jepson:**
We had the rough in inspection and it passed. Then we should be good. Unless we didn't have an inspection. 

**Jack Curtin:**
On. 

**Nick Jepson:**
The goodwill BART job. I had asked Siemens about permitting for like five months straight and they never even gave me an answer on if they have a permit or what the status of the permit is. So it's. I don't understand why they don't do any project management. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Sa. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
I think Brandon's on. 

**Jack Curtin:**
It. Hello? 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Well, what'd he say? And you might want to wait for Jesse to get back, though. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Okay. Yeah, I'll just let y' all know now, but I'll let Jesse know again when he gets back. He said it's fine. Just treat it as if it's like the same situation underneath the canopy. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
So we'll have to know what it can go away. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yes. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Yep. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Yeah, I get that guy on the horn asap. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yeah. Fire sprinkler he's set up for. The earliest he can get here is Thursday. That's like. All right. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Jack, you back? 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yes, I'm back. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Okay. So Brandon was just talking to Chris. He's going to get a guy to come out there, and they're going to get that roughed in, but they're not going to have. I don't know. This should be a dry head, which they're probably not able to get in time, so they'll be just putting in a wet head, but it'll be. Provide the coverage past your inspection, then they got to come out and swap it out at a later date. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Okay. The fire marshal let me. Let me know that he doesn't expect any coverage to. To be there. He said to treat it as if it's the canopy. I don't know what you want me to. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Oh, but that's fine for him, but they owed us that head. The building burns down, and they're saying it's required. Our sprinkler guy, you know, he's the one that designs this thing, so. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Oh, all right. Yeah. Amen. All right. Sweet. Did they say when he could come out? 

**Jesse Dawson:**
I told him at the inspections. Tuesday. Labor Day is Monday, so we better get them out there today or tomorrow. Yeah. So he should let us know. Yes, but if the inspector says no, that's great for whatever on his end, but he. He could show up with another guy Tuesday that says, nah, you need one here, so let's just get it in. They owe it to us. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Absolutely. 

**Nick Jepson:**
Totally. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yeah, you're right. Yep. Yeah. Hopefully they. They kind of owe us to make a quick accommodation given how they've been out here, so. Right on. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Awesome. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Okay. 

**Jack Curtin:**
All right. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
What else? 

**Jesse Remillard:**
So, Jack, what are you going to do about the rest of the dense glass on the canopy on those columns for the ethis to get in there with lifts? 

**Jack Curtin:**
Say. Say that again. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Do you got that taken care of with the EFIs to be able to cover after the framers come in, after the diamonds get bored. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Wait, like, again, they're shooting hat trap hat channel to the columns. That's why I'm saying why are we holding anything up for concrete? It shouldn't even touch the concrete. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
They're shooting hat channel on that. 

**Nick Jepson:**
They said. Well, initially they were going to, but they're trying to save time. So they're just going to wrap it with. With Dem's class. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
I guess shooting hat channel doesn't take that long. But you said they're bringing framing down to the diamonds. 

**Jack Curtin:**
We. 

**Nick Jepson:**
We had hat channel and Glenmark said that they wanted to do hat channel, but this morning Jack had called me and said that it can speed things up to not do the hat channel. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
So. 

**Nick Jepson:**
Just figured we just need to get this done. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yeah. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Have you called John and got an ETA on the concrete guys? Jack? 

**Jack Curtin:**
I have not heard back from John yet. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Did you call him this morning? 

**Jack Curtin:**
No, I just been texting with Zach and he said that Dylan was to mobilize today. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Okay, sorry, I meant Jack. I meant Zach. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yeah, see if he has ETA yet. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
He said they had a pour this morning and wanted to be there by noon. I guess, but I mean, do you. Don't you agree, Jesse? Like, we're just. You know, you shouldn't run the framing down to the bottom anyways because it's going to get wet and just rust the framing out. So they should just shoot everything, pin it to the column, whatever they frame it with. And she that and they could have been done like whenever. Yeah, when we talked about just getting masonite, throw it down, protect the pavement, protect the concrete, get the lift out there and get it done. 

**Jack Curtin:**
It's already half of it's wrapped in dense glass now. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
So we gave them a change order to frame them out and now they're just going to stick the dense glass on there. 

**Nick Jepson:**
It was. They were doing the work on tnm. 

**Jack Curtin:**
And their TNM has been Greg at Glenmark. When he gives a price, it's extremely high. They're type of contractor where their TNM is usually much lower than they're given than their price quote. When they give it. When they give a price. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Do you have a picture of what's being. How it's being installed out there? 

**Jack Curtin:**
I'll get you a picture. I don't have one yet. While they're as they're working, I'm running to Lowe's right now to get some spackle and some rags. No EFS this weekend though. EFIs will be either Tuesday or Wednesday. Okay. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
We'Re gonna have to catch up on that before they start that, Jack, because we want to make sure what kind of lift they're using is not going to destroy that pavement. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Gotcha. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Because that snorkel that they have there's gonna rip it up. Even with masonite down. Even I talked to, I don't remember his name, the foreman for the pavement yesterday and he said he doesn't want to risk even putting something heavy down on masonite or plywood or anything on that pavement because he doesn't want it to sink it. So that's why he said Sunday for sure. But heavy equipment, use caution after. What else is there? 

**Jack Curtin:**
That's all I got for right now, Nick. That part of the payout, when me and you review that today. The surface mounted bollards. McRae and Sons already ordered those. So they're willing. You know, we talked about us taking care of the price of how much it was to order. And then we'll just have United come and slap them in around the ADA ramp. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Check in with Diamond Glass today too and make sure they're still good for the rest of the stuff they have. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yeah. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Yeah. Just checking in with people constantly. If they're not on site when they're supposed to be before they're supposed to be there to keep them on schedule to come there. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yeah, totally. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
And. 

**Jack Curtin:**
I mean Diamond Glass just told me yesterday that he's for sure in place and set up for no later than getting it done by end of next Friday to do the flashing around the donation entry and the rest of the caulking. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
And that you're going to time that you've talked to that masonry foreman and gotten the download I talked to about yesterday when I was with him with what kind of cleaner he's using and their timing on doing that. So they're not going in there and blasting that caulk out or anything? 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yes. Yeah. Okay. He knows that that's taking place next week. He's set up for the following week to wash it. Because he can't wash. He's gonna have to come after the caulker, of course. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Okay, I'm gonna send a meeting invite out for 2 o' clock your time. That's my next opening. Unless you guys aren't going to lunch. Let's just catch up. And then, Jack, when you get off the phone with the calls you're making right now, give me a call, okay? 

**Nick Jepson:**
Okay. So you guys. That too. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Jesse, do you have anything else? 

**Jesse Dawson:**
No. Like the painting. Like, they'll probably also want that curve painted yellow in the front for the fire lane where we replace that sidewalk. 

**Nick Jepson:**
I don't know if that's something you. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Guys discussed or you have covered by the painter. 

**Nick Jepson:**
No, I don't think we. We discussed that. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
I was just looking through the pictures, you know, that you had from yesterday. I thought you'd have some of the pavement. I didn't see any in there. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
I got a ton that I can put in there, Jesse. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yeah, I got some on my phone. I just. I guess I didn't load it on there. I thought I did. Yeah, I got a ton. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Oh, there's something need to get on there. It should be relatively easy to do. You already talked about, you know, you got to get any material. I've seen a bunch of. There's metal framing and all kinds of dense glass still inside the space. Are they getting rid of that today? 

**Jack Curtin:**
Inside? Come on. Inside the building? 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Yeah. I mean, yesterday I put a picture in the donation side. Like, there's a cart full of sheathing and all kinds of. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
That's the side Josh is cleaning up, Jesse. Is he there this morning? Jack? 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yes, yes, he's here. Okay. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Yeah, he's working around the contractors, and they're getting all that cleaned out. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
If you would, Jack, just send me photos just so I can just look at it. Just an extra set of eyes of every, you know, just overall of the inside, the spaces outside the building. And then. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yeah, totally. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
When we meet it this afternoon, there's any other little things that, you know, we think might trip us up during our inspection, you know? 

**Jack Curtin:**
Okay, will do. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
All right, thank you, guys. 

**Nick Jepson:**
Talk to you guys later. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Talk to you in a few minutes, Jack.
