**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Can you see that I screen?
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay, so, yeah, so we'll just go ahead and go through here.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So the lease date is 23rd, 19 or 2019.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Covering the project between.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Blah, blah, blah.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So I, I crossed that out because I didn't have that.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So I, I can't agree to anything that I don't have anything to do with.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And the lease really doesn't have much to do, if anything, with this project.
**John.min**: Unless there's something in there specific, which.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: You could probably just pull out, include, I would say.
**Aelkarrimy**: Right, so we do have to.
**Aelkarrimy**: And we did.
**Aelkarrimy**: Right, you did receive the insurance requirements if those get updated.
**Aelkarrimy**: So we do have to reference the lease in that.
**Aelkarrimy**: If something gets updated, we will provide it.
**Aelkarrimy**: We could say the applicable portions of the lease or the portions of the lease that, you know, contract that contractor has received.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: But we do have to make reference to that lease.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah, if you want to say, like, you know, put in there the, you know, reference the lease and say the applicable portions which are mentioned in this document, then that covers it.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Because then that's saying that if it's, you know, hey, that we're talking about the ones that are in this document versus everything in that document.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So if it pertains to this, it should be in this document.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah, but if it gets revised.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah, if it gets through, if it gets.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Reva, if it gets revised, you just have to notate it.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: But for instance, they could, you know, revise the lease and say, oh, hey, you have to add a second story to our building in your ti.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And then you, you know, technically, you know, oh, you have to hear the lease.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: You have to add the second story.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Like, like, so, yeah, as long as it's, hey, it's notified and, you know, then it's, you Know if there's a change accordingly or if they do something that essentially adds cost, then it's.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: It's going to be a change accordingly.
**Aelkarrimy**: And.
**Aelkarrimy**: Brandon, I'm so sorry, I forgot to ask.
**Aelkarrimy**: Are you the.
**Aelkarrimy**: Are you counsel for the client for your.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I'm the CEO.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I'm the owner.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: Is there counsel on the line?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Nope, just myself.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: I am so sorry, but I can't.
**Aelkarrimy**: If you're represented, your council needs to.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Be on the call.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I'm not represented.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I'll represent myself.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah, we don't have an attorney.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: We do, but I don't.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: These contracts are too simple to engage an attorney.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Like, I'm not going to pay fifteen hundred dollars an hour to have somebody read this and say, what do you think?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Should we accept it?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Like, that's not.
**Aelkarrimy**: No, I get it.
**Aelkarrimy**: But we have a rule, right?
**Aelkarrimy**: Like lawyers have a rule that if you're represented, I need to either have.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: The other counsel on the.
**Aelkarrimy**: On the line or they need to get their consent in writing for me to discuss it with you.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah, we don't have a corporate retained attorney that you would do that with.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Everybody that.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Anybody that I work with is, you know, I hire him on a.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I need you for this basis, so.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Versus you guys are uniqlo's retained corporate attorney.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I, you know, I'm not, I don't hire, I don't bring in an attorney for this kind of simple contract negotiation.
**Aelkarrimy**: I get that, but I have an at.
**Aelkarrimy**: Like, I just can't.
**Aelkarrimy**: Right.
**Aelkarrimy**: So.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Why.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Sorry.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I guess appreciate the time.
**Aelkarrimy**: That's why.
**Aelkarrimy**: No, but that's why my, My team has.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Has been confirming and that council will be on.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: There is no, There is no council to be on, so I can.
**Aelkarrimy**: You're not represented, correct?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Maybe I'm not making that clear.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay, can you just send an email.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: And say we're not represented?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Who do you want me to send that to?
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Can just send it to the group.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: All right.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I mean, I guess.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I mean, we'll.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: We'll find out.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I mean, I would think this is a pretty easy, simple negotiation, but I guess if it gets.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: If it gets.
**Aelkarrimy**: Well, yeah, that's the point.
**Aelkarrimy**: That's.
**Aelkarrimy**: That's the concern.
**Aelkarrimy**: Right.
**Aelkarrimy**: So, like.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Sorry, I'm trying to find the email somewhere.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Thank you again.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Let's see here.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: What's your.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: What's your.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I'm sorry, what's your email?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Who is it?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Whoever's talking.
**Aelkarrimy**: Mine is.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Alana.
**Aelkarrimy**: I L A N A.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Just gotcha.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So I think this is a unique questions about cons contract instruction.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yep.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: We have no legal representation.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Does that suffice?
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Everybody's covered.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: All right, so then the next one, drawing specifications, you put your proposal clarification dated, so that will be attached my team.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Are we okay with that?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah, I'm okay with it.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Are you asking your team or.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah, I'm asking my team.
**Aelkarrimy**: Are we okay with this?
**Aelkarrimy**: Do we have this document?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah, it was attached to the same email with the contract markups.
**Daisuke.mine**: Okay.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Construction schedule.
**Aelkarrimy**: You put that as mutually agreed upon.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: I mean, it should be attached, right?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Well, no, the schedule's not even set yet, so.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay, so.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And the biggest thing, too, is the biggest driver in this is Exotech.
**John.min**: They are not underneath my contract.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So I.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: The schedule has to be mutually agreed upon, which exotech sent me their schedule, and I have to plug in our stuff into their schedule.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Plus anything the ownership takes on.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Like, so me holding to just some schedule that isn't created yet and I don't, you know, own 80% of it, is difficult.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: That's why I said mutually agreed upon.
**Aelkarrimy**: Well, right, because if you go to 4.2, it talks about how you're providing the owner the construction schedule and.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Right, that's what I'm saying.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Like, I'm putting in my, you know, my dates into the exotic schedule.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Exotech is the.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: You know, we don't do anything without exotech installing their stuff, which is underneath you guys.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I don't know how much you know about the project or what it entails, but it's these big, giant racks, and everything revolves around the racks.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: The racks are exotech.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Yeah.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: But in terms of the actual Article 2, the May 23, and no later.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Than March 1, is my team okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: With those dates, those days?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Those dates aren't even accurate.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Like, the Go Live date isn't until, I think, November.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: The esoteric schedule doesn't have any of those dates.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Like, that's why, like I said, this.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: This doesn't even.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: These dates don't make sense because they don't actually apply to what the schedule is with what we have.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay, so can we provide dates or we can't provide dates?
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: I mean.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I mean, yeah, Exotech just sent me the schedule.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I'm plugging in my dates into that schedule, and then we have a meeting on Thursday with the team to go through it.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And that's why, I mean, that schedule has to really be finished.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And even with that, I mean, again, it's all on Exotech.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: As far as their durations.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Like the moment they slip it's critical path.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So I would reference the go live date which is on there.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: That's your real critical date and their commissioning date.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Those are the dates that actually really matter.
**Aelkarrimy**: Right, but we need to put them in the agreement.
**Aelkarrimy**: It's not like to be tbd.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay, well your go.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Your go live date is on this schedule is 11.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Let's see your feedback work.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: It looks like it's 11:9.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I mean he doesn't really call it out as a go live date, but that says ramp up.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So Support, reliability, performance, ramp up train end user certified solution verified maintenance tools verify verifia.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah, I mean it looks like it's November time frame for your go live date.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Like November 9th, 26th.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: Can my team weigh in?
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah.
**Kevin.ly**: Not going to use your silence.
**Kevin.ly**: Is that date aligned with our understanding?
**Stilianos.diakoumakis**: Yeah.
**Stilianos.diakoumakis**: Brandon, how about putting the dates of finishing the installation of the In Rack Sprinkler?
**Stilianos.diakoumakis**: That.
**Stilianos.diakoumakis**: That's the part you guys finish your work, right?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah, we can do that.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Keep in mind though like, so I can put a date for Interact Sprinkler and if the Skypod system is late for whatever reason, like, or it is delayed, then obviously.
**Stilianos.diakoumakis**: Yeah, yeah, but okay, okay.
**Stilianos.diakoumakis**: But as of now, we have the finishing date of Interact Sprinkler finalization dates based on the exotic rack installation finished right after two weeks.
**Stilianos.diakoumakis**: After two weeks of exotic finished installation of Rack will be the finishing date of In Rack Sprinkler.
**Stilianos.diakoumakis**: Isn't it?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: You said two weeks after the date of.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Of when?
**Stilianos.diakoumakis**: Two weeks after the date of finishing the installation of the Rack by exotic team.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Wasn't it exotect.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: No, because we can't.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah, no, I mean it's way, way farther than that.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I mean you've got two months, three months before we would finish after their rack installation.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Because we can't, we can't start.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Like they have to get far enough ahead on their racking and check their racking, go through and do their punch list before we can even start installing our sprinkler.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So we, we would, we move too too fast.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: We would catch them with that short of a duration.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: They wouldn't be able to check anything.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: That's what I was putting in, in this schedule on, on what our duration actually is.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I mean our full, our full duration to do this is going to be three months of install per.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Per rack.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Now that's one question I have for Joe and our meeting on Thursday.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Is he.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: They don't have a Date for when they're going to turn over a section to us.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: All they have is rack installation is done for the.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: The second one is 2.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: 27, 26.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So if we use that date, three months after that, which would be May, into May is when I could turn over the sprinkler.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And that's assuming that he lets me get in there, you know, a little bit before, which he should, because they're going to be.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: It's.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: It's a very big rack.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: They should be checking it.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I'd say halfway through.
**Stilianos.diakoumakis**: Okay, this is about what you're going to explain to us tomorrow, right?
**Stilianos.diakoumakis**: On Thursday, right?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah, yeah.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: That's walking through the schedule.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: That's one thing that we have to go through because.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Because Joe has to tell me I'm making certain assumptions on when I can get in there.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And Joe has to confirm, like, yeah, you know, you're.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: We're good with that because right now he's missing some tasks.
**Aelkarrimy**: All right, so can we just have this as a tv?
**Aelkarrimy**: Well, we'll put.
**Aelkarrimy**: We'll put this in later at this point.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: And so progress payments, are we.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay, so you want based on percentage of work.
**Aelkarrimy**: I mean, it's based on the labor.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Performed and materials used.
**Aelkarrimy**: So.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah, so.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So it's percentage complete.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So if you're 30% complete, it's 30% billing.
**Aelkarrimy**: Well, yeah.
**Aelkarrimy**: Percentage.
**Aelkarrimy**: Can we say percentage of labor performed.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Where.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I'm sorry, where are we at here?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I'm looking at article two.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: You.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Oh, here we go.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: There it is.
**Aelkarrimy**: Basis of percentage of labor performed.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: I mean, I don't see what the.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: If you propose, I guess it's percentage of work complete.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: What?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: The reason I say work complete is because typically that's what banks are going to look at, and that's how we bill it.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: What I.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: What I don't want to run into is we do, like, what's called cost plus projects.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And so that means it's auditable, which is fine, but I just don't have all the added office work in this project to say.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: All right, this is fully audited job.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Here's our certified payroll, blah, blah, blah.
**Aelkarrimy**: Right.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So that's why it's like, hey, we're going to do the work.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And it's like, look, we are 30% done with the racking sprinkler installation.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Here's 30% of that line item.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Like, our schedule.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Our schedule of values isn't broken down.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Labor and materials.
**Kevin.ly**: Are you okay with this?
**Kevin.ly**: For me, it's standard.
**Stilianos.diakoumakis**: Yeah.
**Kevin.ly**: This type of Way.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Stilianos.diakoumakis**: Yeah.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: And you took out sales taxes.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Each application for payment shall specifically and separately set forth all sales taxes.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Do.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah, I mean, we don't.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Our schedule of values does not separate sales tax.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: It's all included.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So what you're.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: The contract's asking doesn't match a schedule of values.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Like are you guys tax exempt or something?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Do you need us to pull all the taxes out?
**Aelkarrimy**: I got a double check on this.
**Aelkarrimy**: But I think, you know, we do need it to just be.
**Aelkarrimy**: I mean, you would have the tax materials.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah, it's included in the number the difference.
**Aelkarrimy**: Right.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: The schedule of values, which is what Is part of the clarifications.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Everything I sent.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So it tells what each one is.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: There is no.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Here is the labor number, here's the material number, here's the tax number.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Now if for some reason you guys have that, you know, you need to pull all the sales tax out because your sales tax exempt, then we can do that.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: But for me to go back and tell like, all right, everybody let's, you know, break all this stuff out and everything.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Unless there's a reason to like that doesn't match our schedule of values that, you know, we were asked to present on and that we submitted.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So that's the confusion is why are we breaking all this out differently than what was in the request?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Like that.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: That reads like this is a cost plus, which is not.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: It's a lump sum.
**Aelkarrimy**: Right, I get that, but I just.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay, let me, I'll double check on that.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: All right.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: So, okay, what's the issue with providing accounting for the disbursement of prior.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So, so this is, this right here.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So I, I said in here like, we will provide an unconditional lien waiver for the amount paid for the previous submission.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So typically in, in construction you have a conditional lien waiver that's submitted with the first payment.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: The second payment, you're going to have a conditional lien waiver for that one and then an unconditional for the first one that we've been paid for.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So what you guys are asking, you know, is something that is a certified statement accounting for disbursement of prior funds.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: That is an unconditional lien waiver.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And so it's just, that is added documentation that I, I don't understand why.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Unless you guys don't want lien waivers, which you do.
**Aelkarrimy**: No, we definitely want lean waivers, but this is not, this is also like disbursements.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I disbursements to subs showing that they've.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Been paid of prior funds.
**Aelkarrimy**: Right, Right.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So you want, you know, a letter certified by somebody saying that we have paid our subs for the previous one.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yes.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: In an unconditional lien waiver showing that we are waiving all lien rights for the previous payment that has been made doesn't constitute that.
**Aelkarrimy**: Well, I guess the lead waiver just shows the total amount and here it's how it's dispersed as opposed to total.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Unconditionally waiver says, hey, we have fully been paid and are waiving all our lien rights for this portion of work and all of our subs have been paid accordingly.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: You know, and we have no lien rights for this million dollars or whatever.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I, I've, I've never submitted an additional document like that.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: If you want to send me an example of what you see or what that looks like, then I'll look at it.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Consider it.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: But I mean, we do.
**Aelkarrimy**: It may just be the lien waiver, then.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Okay, I'll take a look.
**Aelkarrimy**: So and then 4.2.1, you took out.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: The evidence requested by owner and 4.1.2.
**Aelkarrimy**: Which are, you know, the application for payments.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So I don't know why.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yes, I just said.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah, per the prime contract schedule value.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So for our schedule value.
**Aelkarrimy**: That's not defined.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Yeah, that's not defined.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So if we could just like go back to 4.1.2 where, you know, we already set it forth.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: What's required, just making reference to it.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: I'm going to put that back in.
**Aelkarrimy**: So and then 4.2.2, it says to obtain payment by the end of any month.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: That's when you have to submit.
**Daisuke.mine**: You.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Know, application for payment.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: What?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: This says to obtain payment from the owner by the end of the month, an application for payment and form acceptable to the owner must be submitted on.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Before the 21st day of the prior month.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So what I did was the 25th instead of the 21st.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So by the 25th and then if invoice is submitted after due date, owner will have a net 30 payment term.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So if, for instance, for whatever reason we submit on the 26th, it doesn't mean that we forego payment.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: It's no, it's just going to be a net 30.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Okay, I'll confirm.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And the 25th is just, I mean, again, when you're.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I mean, we can do that.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: That if that's, if that's a sticking point for some reason in your accounting.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: It's just that's pretty early in the month.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I mean, our subs typically are not Submitting payment until the 20th.
**Aelkarrimy**: Right.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Okay.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: All right, I'll check with my.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: 5.1.3.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: You took that out.
**Aelkarrimy**: I mean, I think the unconditional lien waiver.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: I mean, you have that in 5.1.1.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: This isn't another.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: This is an affidavit that names material minimum.
**Aelkarrimy**: I don't know that the lien waiver.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Will have all these details.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Well, I mean, provide these details.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I mean, unconditional lien waiver says that, hey, like, we are waiving all lien rights for labor material for this portion, you know, of the contract.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Yeah.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Because I mean, to like.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So you're up.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: You know, earlier, you want a.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: A certified letter saying that we paid stuff on top of an unconditionally waiver.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Then you also want an affidavit that says, hey, by the stuff, by the way, that stuff we referenced before.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Say it again.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: It's all paid for.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Like, I just, I.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I don't know.
**Aelkarrimy**: There's more details here that you don't necessarily have to provide in the lien waiver, but if you want to.
**Aelkarrimy**: If you want me to redefine what the unconditional lien waiver must.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Yeah, if you want to include this, that's fine.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: If you want to say an unconditional lien waiver is like, hey, you are certifying that, you know, all subs, vendors, payroll have been paid, you know, blah, blah, blah, some kind of catch all like that that says everybody's been paid, you know, based off of this progress payment, then, yes, I mean, that's fine.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: But having three or four different documents that, you know, are just certifying that, hey, we paid, we paid, we paid, we paid.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Seems redundant.
**Aelkarrimy**: It's just in the reality of things, it's just the ability to, if it's.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Required to request it.
**Aelkarrimy**: I mean, in reality, I think when you, when you provide the lien waiver.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So long as it suffices what's required in the lease, then we, you know, should be okay.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: And so I'm guessing your comment is.
**Aelkarrimy**: The same on 5.1.8, so I'll try.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: To include that as well.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: So is my team okay with taking out sprinkler drawings approved by public authorities?
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Air balance report as built.
**Kevin.ly**: Lakinesan who the drawing is by?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: TPG or the sprinkler drawing?
**Stilianos.diakoumakis**: Engineering drawing is by tpg.
**Stilianos.diakoumakis**: But construction drawing will be prepared by exact.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: No, no.
**Stilianos.diakoumakis**: Elliott Subs.
**Stilianos.diakoumakis**: Right.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So what it's a.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: What we do is we do what's called the fabrication Drawing.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So that's the inside.
**Stilianos.diakoumakis**: Yeah, Fabrication drawing.
**John.min**: So.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: But this right here says the drawing approved by prop for public authorities.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Our fabrication.
**Stilianos.diakoumakis**: That's by tpg.
**Stilianos.diakoumakis**: Yeah, that's by tpg.
**Stilianos.diakoumakis**: Our sprinkler.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay, so for sprinkler, we can take out the original air balance report.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: There's no test and balance on this job.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay, so we can we take out that and then.
**Aelkarrimy**: But AS built or.
**Aelkarrimy**: And other technical information required for the purposes of maintenance.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: I mean, I think we still need that.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Now, AS built will be by tpg.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: They'll do it as.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: They should do an AS built set for you, like all the designers.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Because since you guys.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: If it was a design build this, then.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yes.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: But since you guys had a design team do it all, they should be doing your.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Your AS builds.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Because anything that's wrong, we're going to call out to them and say, hey, this doesn't match in the field, whatever reason, then we're not going to go redraw everything for them.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: They're going to go draw it and correct their drawing.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Now, as far as you can, you can add a section in here that says closeout documents.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So that's going to be your warranties and maintenance information.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: But the ASBOAT drawings should be on your design team.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Okay.
**Stilianos.diakoumakis**: I'm sorry, Brendan, can I.
**Stilianos.diakoumakis**: Can I give a question?
**Stilianos.diakoumakis**: Is that possible to use your fabrication drawing as.
**Stilianos.diakoumakis**: As build drawing?
**Stilianos.diakoumakis**: No.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah, you guys, that's not what you do.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: No, you guys will have a copy of it.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: But for instance, like, so this says.
**John.min**: All AS built drawings.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So for instance, let's say that the electrical, you know, can't go a certain place because there's a window there.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Whatever.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: We would have to go and redraw the electrical drawings and.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And make them correct.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: As pure as built.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: In reality, what we do is we.
**John.min**: Mark things up that change in the.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Field and we give those to the design team and then they take it and put it on a digital file so you have a clean set of AS built and not just some in the field marked up stuff.
**Stilianos.diakoumakis**: Okay.
**Stilianos.diakoumakis**: So you prepare just only for fabrication, drawing and markup at.
**Stilianos.diakoumakis**: At site if necessary.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah, that's part of our information.
**Stilianos.diakoumakis**: Have to be updated to the design drawing by dpg.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: You want you.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I mean, this is, you know, I mean, I can just give you our field set.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: But me looking out for your best interest is you need a clean set that's easy to read, not all dirty, and, and you know, it's been in the construction field for a year.
**John.min**: So we'll mark stuff up as it.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Comes up and it's recorded, you know, in the rfi.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And it says here, this changed.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: But at the end of the job, they'll compile all those change field changes for whatever reason and put a clean set that says, here you go, here's the clean set of AS built in a digital file that shows what went in.
**Stilianos.diakoumakis**: Okay, but I'm not sure that kind of, you know, cleaning up all the markups you made at site will be updated by tpg.
**Stilianos.diakoumakis**: Those work.
**Stilianos.diakoumakis**: I'm not sure those work are included to the TPG scope between our contract.
**Stilianos.diakoumakis**: So I cannot say.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I mean, then the only thing I can say is, is that we will give you the field set of drawings.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: It will, you know, obviously we'll, we'll turn those over.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: But that's not going to meet your standard of AS built.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I can tell you that.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: At least it's not my standard.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Like, my standard is you get a very, you get a clean new.
**Stilianos.diakoumakis**: Okay, I got your point, but I'm not sure how clean as built drawing has to be and where those as built drawing have to submit to.
**Stilianos.diakoumakis**: Like we have to submit those as built to DOB again or.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Oh, no, no.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I mean, if the only time that we'll resubmit to the department of building is if we do a big change.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: But like, what we're talking about is like, hey, this racking had to move a foot because a crack, whatever, like that shift shifts everything.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: We would not go and say and redo drawings and submit to the department of building.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: They don't care about that.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: What they care about is, hey, you added another mezzanine or something like that, that would be something you would submit.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: But, but little shifts because coordination, they don't.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay, so if you want to, if you want to add in here or you want to change the verbiage, you can just say, you know, alito to turn over field drawings, you know, field drawing as built and you know, maintenance and warranty information.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: That'll cover what your closeout doc.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I mean that's what we're talking about here is close out documentation.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Okay.
**Stilianos.diakoumakis**: And those close out documentation is not submitting to anybody and request for permission.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah, whenever we're done, we, we don't like, we just get a final inspection from the city or you know, the AHJ authority having jurisdiction.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So the fire department and the city officials will come in, say, yep, looks good, pass like, and then they're, they're done.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Like, see ya.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: You get your certificate of occupancy and you can start work.
**Stilianos.diakoumakis**: Okay.
**Stilianos.diakoumakis**: And they gonna check.
**Stilianos.diakoumakis**: They're gonna do the inspection based on design drawing which is not clean up yet.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: No, the design drawings we got we.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: We submitted to the city already.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Those are all done.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So those are submitted.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: The.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: The fabrication drawings, the construction drawings.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: They won't ever see those and they don't care.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: That's simply just.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Our drawings in the field are much more detailed than what's submitted to them.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And so that's just for us to build it.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And they could care less about that.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: All they care about is the permit set which they already have and is submitted.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So the going to come out.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yep.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: This matches what we have.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Good to go.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Sign off on it.
**Stilianos.diakoumakis**: Okay, I got it.
**Stilianos.diakoumakis**: So sorry.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: What.
**Stilianos.diakoumakis**: What should we do for this comment?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I so my opinion and.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And obviously that's all it is is I would change it is you know, I close out documentation and then dash contractor to turn over field drawings O and Ms.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And warranties.
**Stilianos.diakoumakis**: Okay.
**Stilianos.diakoumakis**: So I think if you gave me the markup based on the fabrication drawing, that's enough, I guess.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: That.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Those are the field drawings.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yep.
**Aelkarrimy**: Could you send the proposed language in the email?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah, I'll just put a comment in here.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: 5.3.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So not understanding your comment.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Let's see here.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Oh yeah.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So liquidated damages.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So what I was saying is.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So first of all, this is difficult because your biggest driver is not underneath my contract.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: It's exotic.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So what I was saying is like okay, if we want to do liquidated damages on that, then if I finish early, I get a bonus based off of the same.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: But that's not how it works.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: You know that.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Well, it also is you can't hold me to liquidated damages whenever I don't control the biggest sub on here.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: So contractor each having.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: If contractor has not achieved substantial completion.
**Aelkarrimy**: Right.
**Aelkarrimy**: And then I can put not do you know, I mean keep that not due to.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: To contractors under tenants under owner's control.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah, I mean, you know, you could.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: You could.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I mean you could do.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: That's going to be hard to define.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I mean when you don't have a contract with them.
**Aelkarrimy**: Right?
**Aelkarrimy**: We have a contract with them.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Correct.
**Aelkarrimy**: Right.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So that's control.
**Aelkarrimy**: But the only the issue though is let's say.
**Aelkarrimy**: But you're still managing them, right?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Well, I mean, managing them in.
**John.min**: In what sense?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Because I can't tell exotech.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Like they've got the plan together to put in their racking.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Like I can't, you know, like tell them oh, go out of order.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Like, there's, there's one way to do it, but if they have guys that don't show up or they're behind, I don't have any power to go in and replace them.
**Aelkarrimy**: Right.
**Aelkarrimy**: No, I understand that, but if they're, if they're like, if, if part of the delay is due to your mismanagement.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Of them, that's not what would be.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: What would be an example of, of, of my mismanagement of them that could cause a delay.
**John.min**: Let's just roll.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Let's.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Theoretically, I, I don't.
**Aelkarrimy**: I'm not exactly sure of the work.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: That they're going to be doing, so.
**Aelkarrimy**: I can't specifically, but maybe my team.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Could chime in so I can tell you.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I, I've done.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I mean, I've done the largest ones.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I've done more of these in anybody in the country.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I've done the largest one.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: This is the second, like, excerpt.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: There's one way to do this.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: There's one defined way that they have to go and install the rack concurrently.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And it is what it is.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: There's no real management that we have of them, you know, other than checking in where they are.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: But they, at the end of the day, are the driver.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: We can't do any of our work until they say, yep, you now can have this aisle like we have.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: You know, if they say, hey, listen, you can't touch that yet because we haven't done our inspections.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I, I can't say, well, hey, I got to get in here.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Like, no.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: The most I can say is, hey, Zuk, you know, we were supposed to be able to get into this aisle.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: We can't, you know, this is a day for day loss.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And, and I can tell you that's going to happen, like, things are not going to go exactly according to plan.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And then I got to hit you with delays all the time.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Like, in reality, like, this is, again, a very fluid.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Like, you have to work concurrently with the system, which is, I mean, what we always do.
**John.min**: But there is a ton of stuff.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Outside of just sprinklr that has to go.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: That really is where you're.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: You're going to run into your schedule delays.
**Aelkarrimy**: Well, your scheduled delay is during.
**Aelkarrimy**: Listen, if you have a scheduled delay, that's what change orders are for.
**Aelkarrimy**: So if you're using change order because there's schedule delay, we agree with you.
**Aelkarrimy**: The change order would change the stance.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Substantial completion date.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah, the substantial completion date is the date that's like, we agree on, which.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Is Subject to change due to change orders.
**Daisuke.mine**: That.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Yeah.
**Aelkarrimy**: So if you're not meeting that moving target, that's different.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah, if we want to put that, we can do that.
**Aelkarrimy**: I mean, but that's what it is.
**Aelkarrimy**: I mean substantial completion is defined as that date.
**Aelkarrimy**: But that date gets changed with change orders.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: That's what change orders are for.
**Aelkarrimy**: So you know, this is, this contemplates the moving target, you know, if there is one.
**Aelkarrimy**: But let's say we, we, you know, we've already moved that target and you're still not meeting it.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: That's what this is for.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Because you know, would you be.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: What if I finish early?
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah, but that, then you get paid earlier, but you're not going to get a bonus.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: I mean, that's just not how it works.
**Aelkarrimy**: You have a contract like that?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Oh yeah.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: We have all the time.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: We have shared savings.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I mean to most our clients, they make money when they get open earlier.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And so if they get open earlier, they're like, yeah, if you guys can kick butt and get done earlier, of course we'll give you some shared savings.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Now where that's not contemplated at all here, it's just not.
**Aelkarrimy**: And it's not standard, it's not market.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I mean it may not.
**Aelkarrimy**: You get done earlier, get paid earlier and you get to move on to a next project and get paid elsewhere.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: I mean it's like, no, well, I.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Understand it's not yours, but respectfully, don't.
**John.min**: Tell me it's not something standard.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: It's something that's done common especially in healthcare and big projects like shared savings is a thing.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I can send you some, you know, articles on it.
**Aelkarrimy**: I don't need articles.
**Aelkarrimy**: We can.
**Aelkarrimy**: Listen, that may be your experience, your.
**Aelkarrimy**: Would you be.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay, so are we okay with leaving this in but having some form of caveat that, you know, it's, you know.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Contractors delay and you know.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah, if we put something, yeah, if you put some nomenclature.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: If you put some nomenclature in there that says something like, you know, if delay is solely caused by this contractor, so meaning if it's your guys's vendors or your own personnel or whatever, then we're not at fault.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay, fine.
**Aelkarrimy**: The insurance, I mean, that's something required.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Per hour insurance carrier.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah, we have, we have a, we have a one million dollar umbrella general aggregate.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I just, if that's a requirement, I just need to get with my insurance to get it updated.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: We don't have this coverage right here.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Pollution, insurance, whatever.
**Aelkarrimy**: I'm gonna, I need to confirm with.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: My risk management team See, okay, if.
**Aelkarrimy**: We could take it out.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Change orders.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: You took out original invoices.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Yeah, just see here, that's article 17.
**Aelkarrimy**: Hello.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Sorry.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah, sorry, I thought.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I didn't know you talked about.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: You asked a question.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah, Article seven you took out.
**Aelkarrimy**: You're not going to be providing original.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Invoices for change orders if requested.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah, so, I mean, if we.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So for instance, you're saying like if you, if we have a change order for like whatever, I don't know, hey, we're going to add another racking system.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Like we're going to submit.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Here you go.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Here's the cost for the change.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: We don't have.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: We're not prepaying it.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Like, we don't have invoices.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Like, it's like, hey, here's our, here's our estimate.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Here's our, here's our bid to do this work.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Or here's our, you know, change order for what this costs.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Like what that reads to me is like, hey, you want all the way.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: You want our, Our sub.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Our vendor.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Our vendor sub.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Everybody's full out documentation.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Like this was a cost plus job.
**Aelkarrimy**: I mean, first off, it's only if it's in our discretion.
**Aelkarrimy**: I mean, I don't think.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: If it's not a plaque.
**Aelkarrimy**: If.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Can we put if applicable, what's defined as if applicable?
**Aelkarrimy**: Well, if you have original invoices, we can request them.
**Aelkarrimy**: If, if again, like you said, you're not prepaying, so you don't have them, then it's not applicable.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I would say.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I mean, does all support documentation not cover everything that would be applicable?
**Aelkarrimy**: All support documentation I could put as determined by owner.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I mean, as determined by owner just gives you a blank slate to say whatever you could say as a grant.
**Aelkarrimy**: But for us to approve, right.
**Aelkarrimy**: A change order we need to get.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: The information we need, it's just.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay, yeah, I mean you can say support documentation.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: You know, we'll submit it and if, if we have it, then we'll turn it.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: If not, it's like, then.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Okay, so I'm going to put.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Change order must accompany contractors input and includes all such support documentation as owner may require.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: As owner may reasonably require.
**Daisuke.mine**: Okay.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: And then you took out this 5% cap.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah, I mean even in our contract, our base markup is 10%.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: To my team.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Do you guys want to weigh in?
**Kevin.ly**: Which article?
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Seven.
**Kevin.ly**: Seven.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: There was a cross out.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: I had a 5% cap on overhead and profit.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: And what percent are you saying?
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Sorry?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I mean, our contract, even in what we submitted is 10%.
**Kevin.ly**: Not getting done.
**Kevin.ly**: That's part of the bid, right?
**Kevin.ly**: The 10%.
**Kevin.ly**: The evaluations.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah.
**Stilianos.diakoumakis**: What's.
**Stilianos.diakoumakis**: So we have to pick five or 10.
**Stilianos.diakoumakis**: I.
**Stilianos.diakoumakis**: I didn't get the point.
**Kevin.ly**: The contract we awarded to Aliyah was based on their.
**Kevin.ly**: In their bid was 10 overhead for change order.
**Stilianos.diakoumakis**: Give me maximum.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: We have a 10 markup fee.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah, if you look at.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: If you look at the bottom of our contract, it shows insurance and then 10% fee.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So that carries on throughout the contract.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So if.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: If you guys want to add a third exotech system, then I'm going to say here's the price.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And it's going to have that same markup.
**Stilianos.diakoumakis**: Okay.
**Stilianos.diakoumakis**: So I have to double check.
**Stilianos.diakoumakis**: But 10.
**Stilianos.diakoumakis**: Okay, I will double check that you put 10% for the markup and insurance.
**Aelkarrimy**: I can't wait.
**Aelkarrimy**: 10% markup on and insurance, you said?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So on our line item, we have 1.25% is our insurance and then 10% fee.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So we are insurance.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I'm not sure if you know.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Is built based off revenue.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: That's how much we get billed.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So that's why we have an insurance line item.
**Aelkarrimy**: No, but that's included in your rate.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: If you look at the schedule values at the bottom, it'll say it's overhead too.
**Aelkarrimy**: So your 10% should include that.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: That's overhead.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I appreciate you saying what it should.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I'm telling you what it does.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I mean, at the end of the day, like, you know, other people are going to bury this in different categories.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I'm upfront and open with exactly what it is.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: You know, just like you guys run your business and you.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: You have your margins for what you deliver to your clientele or the same.
**Aelkarrimy**: So you want profit of 10% and then you want overhead of another one.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: One point.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: What was it?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: 4%.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Insurance of 1.25%.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And then contractor fee is 10%.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And I.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I can send you the snippet from the.
**Aelkarrimy**: So my team.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: You have to confirm 11.25%.
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah.
**Kevin.ly**: Alana.
**Stilianos.diakoumakis**: Well, it was.
**Stilianos.diakoumakis**: It was.
**Stilianos.diakoumakis**: It was insurance for 1.25 and overhead and profit is 10% and total is.
**Stilianos.diakoumakis**: Yeah.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So.
**Aelkarrimy**: But that would have.
**Aelkarrimy**: So just take it back and confirm.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: That it would apply to change orders as well.
**Kevin.ly**: Okay.
**Daisuke.mine**: Okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Who's the owner's rep?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: It reference references the owner's rep.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I don't think we have one on this project unless there's one added.
**Aelkarrimy**: It's the representative that we designate.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: I mean, we'll designate it.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: I don't know that One is designated yet.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay, so then contractor acknowledges that owner has appointed an owner's representative.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So then no, that we.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I guess we scratch that because we don't have one.
**Aelkarrimy**: Have we appointed one to my team?
**Aelkarrimy**: Do we have a rep?
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Did we decide.
**Kevin.ly**: Can you explain be the rep.
**Kevin.ly**: I don't want.
**Aelkarrimy**: It's our internal team.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Somebody from our internal team.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay so, so that's just the owner.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Like that's not necessarily like when I, when I see owner's rep.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Typically what that states is an owner's outside third party company.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So you guys, you don't, you're not going to have an outside third party company acting on your behalf.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: It's going to be working with Yuzuke and your team, correct?
**Aelkarrimy**: I mean it could be.
**Aelkarrimy**: I need my team to confirm.
**Kevin.ly**: Yes, they'll be directly with us.
**Daisuke.mine**: Okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: With.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Again with the job.
**John.min**: This not complex.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I would encourage saving the, saving the fee on that.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So yeah, so if you just want to put, if you just want to put, you know, the main contact is Zuke, I guess or whoever's going to be the main contact for Uniqlo then that, that satisfies that.
**Aelkarrimy**: And then nine.
**Aelkarrimy**: So I'll get back to you on that.
**Aelkarrimy**: A 9 15.
**Aelkarrimy**: You'll comply with you know what provisions.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: We will reference the lease.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah.
**Aelkarrimy**: Just like what we discussed in the beginning.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yep.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay, I have five minutes and I.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Have to hop on another call.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: But.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I don't know, I didn't highlight this stuff.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I don't know why it was highlighted.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: It came to me like that.
**Aelkarrimy**: So that's fine.
**Aelkarrimy**: I'll take it out.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: That's my highlight.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: The more specific contract documents reference and provisional.
**Aelkarrimy**: So you took, took out the lease.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Again, it will be subject to what we discussed.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So we're going to put that back in and then the more specific contract document, reference or provision shall prevail.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: And you're saying your.
**Aelkarrimy**: Bid that's included in contract documents.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So if you look at the first page of the fixed price contract documents are defined as having that included.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Right.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: But this says the more specific contract document reference or provision shall prevail.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So what that says is that for instance the drawings.
**John.min**: Right.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So the contract documents specify the permit drawings which just got issued Friday.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Our contract documents are based off of the bid set.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And so technically the more specific would be the set that just sent out last Friday which added, you know, a thousand sprinkler heads or whatever.
**Aelkarrimy**: Right.
**Aelkarrimy**: So that would prevail because it's more, more specific.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: No, because we don't have that priced.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Because our price was based off the bid documents, which is what our clarifications are.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: How can we price up something we just got three days ago?
**Daisuke.mine**: We're.
**Aelkarrimy**: Why are we talking about.
**Aelkarrimy**: It's.
**Aelkarrimy**: If there's a conflict between one document and the next.
**Aelkarrimy**: Right.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Then our clarifications prevail.
**Aelkarrimy**: But if something is more defined after.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: That, wouldn't that prevail?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: No, because that these contract documents that you're referencing, the permit set, were just issued before or after we already gave our number.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay, so then you're covered.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: No.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Even with this language.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Covered?
**John.min**: How is that.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Because this says the more specific.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So you're saying that more specific constitutes.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Our clarifications are more specific than the permit drawings?
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: They could be, yeah.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I mean, that's up to interpretation.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: If it's the sole discretion of the owner.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I don't know.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Like, I mean, where is it.
**Aelkarrimy**: Does it say sole discretion of the owner?
**Aelkarrimy**: I mean, I'm not.
**John.min**: I'm not saying it says that.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I was asking who.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Whose interpretation is it that.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: What's more specific?
**Aelkarrimy**: If.
**Aelkarrimy**: If you.
**Aelkarrimy**: In what if in your permit just have, you know, sprinkler set and your specifications.
**Aelkarrimy**: Right.
**Aelkarrimy**: Your.
**Aelkarrimy**: Whatever the contract clarifications show exactly where.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Those sprinklers are, what kind of sprinklers and Da, da, da.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Those are more specific.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: If you.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: If you're saying that our clarifications are more specific than the drawings and then therefore it would provide.
**Aelkarrimy**: I'm giving you an example.
**Aelkarrimy**: They may not be in some instances.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: That's what I'm saying.
**Aelkarrimy**: Whichever one is more specific, that's the.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: One that controls.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Up to who's.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I mean.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: But that's up to somebody's interpretation because.
**Aelkarrimy**: I mean, you could tell what specific or not.
**Aelkarrimy**: If you say sprinkler set and another one shows exactly what the spring.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: You know the specifications for the sprinkler set.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Then we can leave that.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: 2.3.4.
**Aelkarrimy**: Then you took out contractor acknowledge has.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Been provided specifically provisions.
**Aelkarrimy**: We did provide them too.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So we'll make sure those are added.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: All right.
**Aelkarrimy**: 2.3.4.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Eddie worked under Sessions.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Okay.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: It says accept as authorized.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So what's the issue here?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Any work done after such discovery except as authorized shall be done at the contractor's risk if the work shall stop until instruction is given by the owner.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And any delay will not be the fault contractor.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So I would.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: It's just the delay part.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: What delay part?
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: I'm not sure.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So that's What I'm adding in here essentially, is, like, in the event that this happens and work is stopped waiting on authorization, any delay will not be the fault of the contractor.
**Aelkarrimy**: There's a discrepancy.
**Aelkarrimy**: Again, it's a matter of change order.
**Aelkarrimy**: So if you look at the change order.
**Aelkarrimy**: Right.
**Aelkarrimy**: The definition of change orders, you could see what would be included as part.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Of a change order.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: I have to get on another call.
**Aelkarrimy**: I can confirm these and kind of.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Send you my comments to the rest of yours and you can take a look at it.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Does that work for you?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yep, that works.
**Daisuke.mine**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: All right.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: And that's what we'll do.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: Thank you.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Thank you.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Thanks.
