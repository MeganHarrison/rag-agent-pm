## Transcript
**Bschwartz**: Hi, team.
**Bryan.wagar**: Hey, how are you?
**Bschwartz**: What's going on, Brandon?
**Bschwartz**: How's it going?
**Bryan.wagar**: Well, doing well.
**Bryan.wagar**: Survived the tornado last night.
**Bschwartz**: I heard, I heard, I heard the tariffs are kicking in ridiculously.
**Bschwartz**: I think we can try to get started to help you out.
**Bschwartz**: Brandon, I know that you're trying to gather like the timeline of the finalized set that you guys will be able to permit.
**Bschwartz**: Brian and Luther, do we have a timeline on like a fixed timeline or.
**Bschwartz**: Not yet.
**Ken.mathewson**: Yeah.
**Ken.mathewson**: Luther and I talked this morning.
**Ken.mathewson**: We'll need about two weeks to get through those racking updates, get our set QC'd and shipped to your office.
**Ken.mathewson**: So we're, we'd like to Target the, the 18th.
**Ken.mathewson**: 18th to have you guys.
**Ken.mathewson**: That's it.
**Bryan.wagar**: Brian, if you, if you guys can share like, you know, you got 80 or whatever, you know, in a week, then we'll, we'll take a day and look through it and you know, send back any notes or anything.
**Bryan.wagar**: That way you guys have a second set of eyes on it.
**Ken.mathewson**: Okay.
**Ken.mathewson**: Yeah, we can probably share a progress set the end of next week while we're QCing, if you guys want to look over it.
**Ken.mathewson**: We just need to get those, those cardboard tote racks updated for the correct fire sprinkler criteria.
**David.leddy**: Yeah, and I reviewed that drawing this morning.
**David.leddy**: I've been traveling, so I just got a chance to look at it and it's exactly what we need.
**David.leddy**: I mean, it's just a red highlight section to tell us which one's gonna have the cardboard storage.
**David.leddy**: That's all we need.
**Bschwartz**: Okay, so if we're going to target the 18th, then, Brendan, is it possible that we go into permit on the 21st?
**Bryan.wagar**: I mean, theoretically, yeah.
**Bryan.wagar**: I mean if all the, all the drawings and everything are good.
**Bryan.wagar**: I mean, yeah, I mean we should, should be able to.
**Bschwartz**: Okay, and then Brian and John, for both of you, the.
**Bschwartz**: I got on the call with the plans examiner.
**Bschwartz**: He's a very cool guy.
**Bschwartz**: He's willing to give us permit within a 48 hour period, even though I say one to two weeks on my emails.
**Bschwartz**: But he's saying that we must have all the calculations.
**Bschwartz**: Calculations, the, the latest pump test or like, like he just wants all calculations, structural loads, you name it.
**Bschwartz**: Everything has to be in that package.
**Bschwartz**: And they'll turn around permit right away.
**Ken.mathewson**: Okay.
**Ken.mathewson**: Yeah, we'll have fire sprinkler calculation, the hydraulic calculations.
**Ken.mathewson**: Luther, I'm pretty sure we have the latest pump tests from that from the building.
**Race.kangas**: We do.
**David.leddy**: Would you be able to just share with us the code reviewers information so I could Just give them a quick call just to make sure.
**David.leddy**: I can run through any fire code questions, make sure that we have all of our ducks in a row, just to make sure that everything goes off without a hitch.
**Bschwartz**: Do you mind if I paste it onto this chat for you?
**David.leddy**: Yeah, that's perfectly fine.
**David.leddy**: I mean, however you want to share it to me is fine.
**David.leddy**: I just need a contact so I know who to reach out to.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Building review.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Oh, I'm in the wrong project number.
**Joseph.burdzy**: That's why I'm like, where did it go?
**Joseph.burdzy**: Uniqlo release building analysis.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Here we go.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Permitting summary.
**Bschwartz**: The receptionist sits right next to the plans examiner, Luther.
**Bschwartz**: So if her name is Eileen, she's a very sweet person.
**Bschwartz**: She'll be able to walk right over and just put herself on speaker and get you the answers you're looking for.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Straightforward.
**Bschwartz**: Okay.
**Bschwartz**: All right, so at this time, Brandon, what do you need from the team other than the drawings by the 18th, and then segmental sets next week, and then the following week we'll have the final set.
**Bschwartz**: What else would you need from the architectural and engineering team, as well as Exotech?
**Bryan.wagar**: So the exotech CAD drawings for the.
**Bryan.wagar**: Whatever the latest system is and their PDFs, because we'll want to have that with our guys to make sure that everything lines up and is coordinated properly.
**Bryan.wagar**: And then with.
**Bryan.wagar**: I don't know if Uniqlo is on this, but we.
**Bryan.wagar**: They'll have the contract back today, so obviously getting that executed with them.
**Bryan.wagar**: And then.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, for the design team, I think you.
**Bryan.wagar**: You've got all the architectural MEPs, right?
**Bryan.wagar**: It's just the fire sprinkler that we're waiting on.
**Bschwartz**: Yeah, but.
**Bschwartz**: But there is also the.
**Bschwartz**: Just.
**Bschwartz**: The bollard scope is being updated on the structural.
**Bschwartz**: Just to show you the.
**Bschwartz**: The footing for that as well as the drainage.
**Bschwartz**: Brian, are we updating the drainage for the compressor system, or is it staying the same?
**Joseph.burdzy**: Currently.
**Ken.mathewson**: Everything should remain the same with the exception of a small added oil water separator that will go in line with the condensate drain.
**Ken.mathewson**: Just to meet.
**Ken.mathewson**: We did get in contact with the HJ and they said that they would be required, so we'll add that.
**Ken.mathewson**: But otherwise the condensate drainage will remain as it currently shows on our drawings.
**Ken.mathewson**: Well, indirect drain from the compressors to a floor sink, which will be routed underground to the nearby janitor's closet where there's the sanitary pump, ejector pump.
**Bschwartz**: So then.
**Bschwartz**: Yeah, Brandon, yes, it will just be an update to the fire suppression.
**Bschwartz**: And then for the plumbing it's just adding that.
**Bschwartz**: That component to separate the oil from the water.
**Brian.hammond**: Okay.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah.
**Bryan.wagar**: And then in that footer.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah.
**Bryan.wagar**: So whatever we're, we're changing or adding, we'll just get a narrative.
**Bryan.wagar**: That way we make sure it's not missed.
**Bryan.wagar**: I mean, we'll scrub the drawings too, but, you know, since we're not actually cloud.
**Bryan.wagar**: Clouding anything, then just a simple narrative sheet will.
**Bryan.wagar**: Will help.
**Bschwartz**: Will do.
**Joseph.burdzy**: We'll do.
**Bryan.wagar**: So, yeah, we'll get.
**Bryan.wagar**: Like I said, we'll get everything, start getting reviewed and everything figured out.
**Bryan.wagar**: And then.
**Bryan.wagar**: Do you know when the racking is supposed to arrive?
**Bryan.wagar**: I don't know if race is on here.
**Bschwartz**: Joe's on August.
**Bryan.wagar**: Well, we got plenty of time.
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay, that's good news.
**Race.kangas**: Okay.
**Race.kangas**: For.
**Race.kangas**: Yeah, the.
**Race.kangas**: Another question I was going to ask though is do you need PE stamped.
**Bryan.wagar**: Drawings to be submitted for your racking system?
**Race.kangas**: Yeah.
**Bryan.wagar**: Did you, did you ask them about that, Hamed?
**Bschwartz**: No, I have not.
**Bschwartz**: You.
**Bschwartz**: They just asked for.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Yeah, go ahead.
**Bryan.wagar**: I'd have to double check Joe and, and see what this municipality requires.
**Bryan.wagar**: I would think that.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, I need to just double check.
**Bryan.wagar**: What?
**Bryan.wagar**: I don't know.
**Bryan.wagar**: I'd have to look up and see what the code requires for.
**Bryan.wagar**: Is there a special racking permit?
**Bryan.wagar**: I don't.
**Bschwartz**: Yes, there.
**Bschwartz**: No, no, there is.
**Bschwartz**: There is a special racking permit.
**Bschwartz**: Yeah.
**Bschwartz**: Where it doesn't really require drawings, but they, they requested that for just life safety and all the exit signs and the light.
**Bschwartz**: So that's why there's an architectural component.
**Bschwartz**: Let me call Eileen.
**Bschwartz**: The phone number is in the chat.
**Bschwartz**: So I'm going to do my, my own due diligence and just ask if we need to submit a racking permit.
**Bschwartz**: And then what.
**Bschwartz**: What does that entail?
**Bschwartz**: Does it entail that Exotech needs to submit sign and seal drawings as well?
**Bschwartz**: We'll get that information from the plans examiner first thing tomorrow.
**Race.kangas**: Yeah, let me, let me know.
**Race.kangas**: Because we did start the process of getting those stamped and it's going to be about two to three weeks to get them back.
**Race.kangas**: But this is strictly for just the racking.
**Race.kangas**: But if it's not required, you know, you can, you can definitely save us some money here.
**Bschwartz**: No, that's what I'm going to try to see if it is even required.
**Bschwartz**: If it's not required and they're okay with just the architectural portion showing the racks and whatnot, that's fine.
**Bschwartz**: But if they come back and ask for structural loads and like what is the metals made out of and the connections for that Then we definitely need you guys to submit those.
**Bryan.wagar**: Most time they want to see the connections.
**Bryan.wagar**: Joe.
**Bschwartz**: Yeah, yeah, because I see that the Daifuku system, they showed sections, elevations, the bolting, you name it, they had everything on there.
**John.min**: Ahmed, on that same note, I believe this came from earlier coordination.
**John.min**: We had listed the RAC submittal as a deferred submittal in our structural set.
**John.min**: Should we pull that?
**John.min**: Because if it's going to be issued at the same time permit is issued, it wouldn't be a deferred submittal.
**John.min**: It would just be another package that's submitted at the same time that would be kind of separate from us or would if it, if they do go ahead and get the structural calcs and they do require that, will that be submitted later or at the same time we submit everything else to the city?
**Bryan.wagar**: I mean, you, you typically want to submit it all at once, and you, you don't need anything on your structurals.
**Bryan.wagar**: Technically.
**Bryan.wagar**: Like, it'll be its own package, whether it's stamped or not.
**Bryan.wagar**: Just because you got to pull a racking permit.
**Bryan.wagar**: So really, what they typically, what I see when they look at this, they want to see the life safety show and travel distances, and then structurally, all that information is going to be on the racking drawings itself.
**John.min**: Okay, so we'll, we'll remove the deferred submittal portion of our set.
**John.min**: That shows the.
**John.min**: Yeah, that calls out the racking element.
**Bschwartz**: John, before you do that, let me just first call the local jurisdiction and just confirm if a racking permit is required and if they do require to see structural for those racks, if that's the case, then I'll definitely give everybody a heads up and then we can remove that note.
**Bschwartz**: But until then, I think we should just keep it until we, we confirm.
**Bschwartz**: I just don't want you to keep updating stuff.
**Joseph.burdzy**: That's why too.
**John.min**: Okay, sounds good.
**Ken.mathewson**: Ahmed.
**Ken.mathewson**: Since the topic of deferred submittals got brought up, did, did they confirm that they're going to permit off of our drawings and are not going to require the, the contractors shop drawings for the.
**Bschwartz**: Fire sprinkler system, the subcontractor has to submit the, like they're submitting their sign and sealed shop drawing as a delegated design?
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Okay.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So.
**Bschwartz**: Yeah, so they just, they have to, we just have to make sure that they're, they're comfortable with your drawings.
**Bschwartz**: And if they come back with any changes or deviations, we have to let exotech know.
**Bschwartz**: And then you guys also just have to be okay with those changes.
**Ken.mathewson**: Yep.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Okay.
**Bryan.wagar**: So once we get those CAD files, then we'll be able to put our stuff together.
**Bschwartz**: Fairfab, Joe, is there any way we can get the CAD files sooner than the drawings that will be signed and sealed?
**Bschwartz**: Because I know you're saying two to three weeks, but I just don't want to hold everything up more than two weeks.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Really?
**Race.kangas**: When you're saying the CAD you need, do you want everything?
**Race.kangas**: You want the conveyor and all of that?
**Bryan.wagar**: No, I just want all the racking.
**Bryan.wagar**: And if you can flatten it too, because I think you guys use a different system.
**Bryan.wagar**: We ran into this on one where when we converted it to ours, it like shifted some stuff.
**Bschwartz**: Yeah, I ran into that issue recently with Exotech.
**Bschwartz**: I don't know, Joe, do you want me to just give him the DWGs that we have, or are you guys revising them in a way where that it'll be able.
**Bschwartz**: That they can use them?
**Race.kangas**: I mean, I would give them what we have or what you have.
**Race.kangas**: I mean, I don't.
**Race.kangas**: I don't see why not.
**Bschwartz**: But can you just.
**Bschwartz**: What I'm going to do is I'm going to send you an email if you can just confirm that the DWG that I'm going to send you along with the PDF is what we should supply.
**Bschwartz**: Aliato.
**Bschwartz**: And we'll do that right away, but just so we can have it properly documented that you guys are okay with that racking that's reflected on the architectural drawings.
**Race.kangas**: Let me make sure it's the latest one updated.
**Race.kangas**: I got you.
**Bschwartz**: Awesome.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, just keep in mind, like that.
**Bryan.wagar**: I mean, when you send that, that's got to be that flattened one because.
**Bschwartz**: It is, it is.
**Bschwartz**: We ran into exactly that shift will.
**Bryan.wagar**: Will screw up the fad.
**Bschwartz**: It really did screw us up where, like even the columns were moving with the racks in a weird way.
**Bschwartz**: But then we fixed our background accordingly and Joe and the team was able to help us out a little bit.
**Bschwartz**: All right, so I will get you.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Guys the drawings to Joe.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Joe, to confirm DWG/PDF.
**Bryan.wagar**: Do you know when you have concrete remediation lined up or is.
**Bryan.wagar**: Is there an owner?
**Race.kangas**: We're just starting that.
**Race.kangas**: It's going to be with a company called cogri.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Yeah.
**Race.kangas**: But they're planning on doing their remediation in June.
**Race.kangas**: I believe they want to get the survey done in May and they want to get the remediation done in June.
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay, so then.
**Bryan.wagar**: So you guys remediate in June.
**Bryan.wagar**: They'll come in, you know, get the four done in.
**Bryan.wagar**: In July whatnot.
**Bryan.wagar**: Like early July, you should be done.
**Bryan.wagar**: And so I'm assuming at that, like whenever you guys come lay out.
**Bryan.wagar**: Ideally, since we're.
**Bryan.wagar**: We typically don't put.
**Bryan.wagar**: We don't.
**Bryan.wagar**: Until we don't put lights up for these.
**Bryan.wagar**: But because we're doing it on this one and lining it up, the.
**Bryan.wagar**: The best way to do that is after you guys are when you're there laying it out.
**Bryan.wagar**: Because that, you know, that thing can adjust a couple inches here and there.
**Bryan.wagar**: That's when we line up our lights in those aisles.
**Bryan.wagar**: How do you feel about that?
**Bschwartz**: So I know that Yusuke was trying to have all the overhead run while they're still putting the racks together, because I believe.
**Bschwartz**: I don't know what's the duration per rack, but it's.
**Bschwartz**: You have two zones where you can assemble two racks at the same time.
**Bschwartz**: So how long does each one take and how many teams from exotech will be there to assemble versus Will they be able to mark the entire footprint for us?
**Bschwartz**: So then we know where the aisles land and we can just start running our conduit to that point.
**Bschwartz**: Those are the kind of things that I think we should have calls with Exotech so we could just iron out the logistics of what is.
**Bschwartz**: What are we doing first?
**Bschwartz**: Because I know you.
**Bschwartz**: Suke has been driving the bus with what we should start off with versus what we shouldn't.
**Bschwartz**: But I think it'll be more of what Exotech and Eliaso really needs to do in order to achieve the timeline.
**Bryan.wagar**: I mean, we're gonna.
**Bryan.wagar**: The big.
**Bryan.wagar**: I mean, we're gonna catch them on the sprinkler sites.
**Bryan.wagar**: The biggest thing is, is what kind of crews can you throw at it, Joe?
**Bryan.wagar**: I mean, that's going to be the driver.
**Race.kangas**: We'Re doing.
**Race.kangas**: We're doing one crew.
**Race.kangas**: We're building basically the right sky pod first call it Skypod B.
**Race.kangas**: We're starting in the top right corner and building right to left and then down.
**Race.kangas**: And then we'll move to Skypod A and do the same thing.
**Race.kangas**: And then as we're finishing Skypod B, we'll start doing a lot of the conveyor on the north side.
**Race.kangas**: We definitely need to have a different.
**Race.kangas**: A separate call for this.
**Race.kangas**: And I have a.
**Race.kangas**: I have a whole printout that.
**Race.kangas**: A presentation that I can.
**Ken.mathewson**: Hey, Brandon, have you heard of Dusty Bot?
**Bryan.wagar**: Dusty Bot?
**Ken.mathewson**: Yeah, it's.
**Ken.mathewson**: It's a system that we've seen used on other ASR systems like this.
**Ken.mathewson**: It basically can take a CAD file and print it out on the concrete floor, which would give you guys a, I guess a 2D representation in the building to.
**Ken.mathewson**: To work off of.
**Ken.mathewson**: Just throwing that out there as an option to help on site coordination.
**Bryan.wagar**: Oh yeah, these things, we use them for framing.
**Bschwartz**: Yeah, they.
**Bschwartz**: They do use them for framing.
**Bschwartz**: Yeah.
**Ken.mathewson**: Okay.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, I mean, we can.
**Bschwartz**: We're gonna be.
**Race.kangas**: We're going to be marking up the floor too.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, that's what I was saying, Brian.
**Bryan.wagar**: Their.
**Bryan.wagar**: Their foreman will come in and.
**Bryan.wagar**: And he's gonna lay this thing out and whatnot.
**Bryan.wagar**: So I mean, as much as we like to say it'll all match the drawings and everything, I.
**Bryan.wagar**: Again, it.
**Bryan.wagar**: It may shift an inch or two here and there.
**Bryan.wagar**: It's.
**Bryan.wagar**: It's not.
**Bryan.wagar**: It's not something we haven't seen often.
**Bryan.wagar**: But I mean, we'll defer.
**Bryan.wagar**: We'll defer to Joe.
**Bryan.wagar**: I mean, I'm gonna follow his lead and his crew on it.
**Bschwartz**: All right, so then, Joe, we should plan a call with Brandon sometime next week just so we can go through this logistics.
**Bschwartz**: And then once we are.
**Bschwartz**: Once we are aligned with.
**Bschwartz**: With Brandon's team, I think then we advise Yusuke.
**Bschwartz**: So then this way we're all under the same umbrella.
**Bschwartz**: We all.
**Bschwartz**: We know what we want to do and how we want to achieve it.
**Bschwartz**: And just because I would like to limit how many times he gets involved with the mobile, like the timeline, because there's a lot of hypotheticals that he keeps speaking of.
**Bschwartz**: And I would like to iron things down, especially like you're saying August 1st for the racking.
**Bschwartz**: Meanwhile, Yusuke is thinking July 1st for.
**Joseph.burdzy**: The racking, which is not accurate.
**Bschwartz**: So.
**Bschwartz**: So let's try to have a breakout call next week.
**Bschwartz**: I don't know.
**Bschwartz**: Like, do you guys want to just iron it out now?
**Race.kangas**: Yeah, well, I'm not on my computer right now, but let's.
**Race.kangas**: Let's definitely do something next week during.
**Race.kangas**: During the day, if that's.
**Bschwartz**: I gotcha.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, I agree.
**Bryan.wagar**: We'll pull up the schedule and go through everything and I'll have my.
**Bryan.wagar**: My field guy with us.
**Bryan.wagar**: Joe.
**Bschwartz**: Okay, and then what.
**Bschwartz**: What day works best for both of you where you guys don't have like too much on your calendar?
**Bryan.wagar**: I mean, I'm.
**Bryan.wagar**: I'm pretty open Wednesday before 1.
**Race.kangas**: Yeah, same thing.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Wednesday before 1.
**Bschwartz**: I'm open completely on Wednesday before 1.
**Bschwartz**: So I will send an invite for the 9th for.
**Bschwartz**: Let's call it 11:00am Is that okay with that for me?
**Bryan.wagar**: Yep.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Alrighty.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Let's do that right now.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Home teams.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Wednesday, 11:30am Uniqlo schedule.
**Bschwartz**: Brandon, should I put Jesse on this?
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, you can add him.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Gotcha.
**Bschwartz**: And then Joe, should I put Race on this?
**Race.kangas**: You can put him as optional.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Gotcha.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Race.
**Joseph.burdzy**: And then Joseph.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Awesome.
**Joseph.burdzy**: That's on the calendar.
**Bschwartz**: All right.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Who's.
**Bschwartz**: Oh, Jess is joining right now.
**Bschwartz**: Okay.
**Bschwartz**: So I think.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Sorry, Joe, do you want those cats to be bound or.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Or standard?
**Bschwartz**: Oh, Brandon.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Sorry, Brand.
**Bryan.wagar**: You can make them standard.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, because we're only going to take.
**Bryan.wagar**: We don't.
**Bryan.wagar**: We're only.
**Bryan.wagar**: We're going to take a few of them, the elevations and the.
**Bryan.wagar**: The things.
**Bryan.wagar**: And we don't need it all bound together.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: All right, Got it.
**Bschwartz**: All right, so just to recap here, we'll follow up with Yusuke regarding the contract.
**Bschwartz**: Because you guys were owed the contract today.
**Bschwartz**: Exotic.
**Bryan.wagar**: I've got the contract.
**Bryan.wagar**: I'm sending it.
**Bryan.wagar**: We.
**Bryan.wagar**: I gotta send him back the markups.
**Bschwartz**: Oh, nice, nice.
**Bschwartz**: Okay, so then I don't have to follow up with him on the contract.
**Bschwartz**: And then exotech will provide CADs and PDFs.
**Bschwartz**: Well, we're going to supply the CADs and then the PDFs to Joe.
**Bschwartz**: Joe, you will confirm that those backgrounds and the PDFs are good to go for Brandon's use once that's the case.
**Bschwartz**: Brandon, you're good to go with those links.
**Bschwartz**: Consultant drawings will be ready by 4:18.
**Bschwartz**: However, we're going to try to send out an 80% set next.
**Bschwartz**: At the end of next week, Friday TPG will contact DOB and just inquire on the racking permit and then structural.
**Bschwartz**: I'll get back to you.
**Bschwartz**: John, if we are going to be removing that deferred submittal note and that's it.
**Bschwartz**: Really?
**Bschwartz**: That's.
**Bschwartz**: That's all that I have here.
**Bryan.wagar**: Cool.
**Bryan.wagar**: All right, thank you for the time everybody.
**Bryan.wagar**: Give me a Shoot me a note if you need anything and we'll get this thing planned out and knocked out.
**Bschwartz**: And Brandon, I'm so sorry.
**Bschwartz**: One last thing.
**Bschwartz**: Just so you're aware, Yusuke has our weekly calls kind of late.
**Bschwartz**: He kind of joins at 6:30 instead of 5:30 just due to the time.
**Bschwartz**: So I urge you to send an email with what day?
**Bschwartz**: Like just requesting what day will we have a standalone weekly call for construction this way.
**Bschwartz**: Then you guys can send out an invite and we'll just follow suit from there.
**Bryan.wagar**: Gotcha.
**Bryan.wagar**: I will shoot that out.
**Bschwartz**: Okay, awesome.
**Bschwartz**: Well, thank you everyone for joining the call.
**Bschwartz**: I'll probably hop on at 6:30 and just kind of download Yusuke and John Min and we'll take it for we'll take it step by step next week.
**Bryan.wagar**: Cool.
**Bryan.wagar**: Sounds good.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Sounds good.
**Ken.mathewson**: Thanks, everyone.
**Bschwartz**: Thanks, everyone.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Take care.
**Bryan.wagar**: Ahmed, you got a minute?
**Bschwartz**: Yeah, I got a minute.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Thanks, everyone.
**Bschwartz**: Oh, Ben, I'm gonna call.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Yeah, Come here back.
**Brian.hammond**: Bye.
