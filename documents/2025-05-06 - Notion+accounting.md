## Transcript
**Megan**: Can you hear me?
**Speaker 1**: Yes.
**Speaker 1**: Hello?
**Megan**: Okay.
**Megan**: Awesome.
**Megan**: Yeah.
**Megan**: So Megan is going to join soon, so that's good.
**Megan**: So if you want to, you know, share your screen and have the comparison between what you want and what you know, it's needed and et cetera.
**Megan**: So maybe she can help us with that.
**Megan**: Okay.
**Megan**: I know that you want to like a specific view from the timesheet, so let's see if she can help us with that.
**Megan**: Yeah, it sends me my loom so we can screen record this.
**Megan**: Wait for Megan.
**Megan**: Hi, Megan.
**Megan**: How are you?
**Megan**: Oh, it's.
**Megan**: No, it's just Megan's phantom note taker.
**Megan**: I thought it was Megan's.
**Megan**: Okay, there she is.
**Megan**: Hi, Megan.
**Megan**: How are you?
**Speaker 2**: Good.
**Megan**: How are you?
**Megan**: Good.
**Megan**: So sorry to keep bothering you with this.
**Megan**: So we just have a quick question.
**Megan**: I know you're busy, so Fritzi here from accounting has just some questions related to the timesheet.
**Megan**: And so she's gonna just go ahead and show you how maybe like if we can change maybe the view or if there's something from that we can filter from what you already created.
**Megan**: So Fritz, if you want to show Megan.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, sorry.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So this is the time sheet, right?
**Speaker 1**: Are you able to see my screen?
**Speaker 2**: Yep, I can see it.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So we tried earlier, like entering this is what it look like in the spreadsheet.
**Speaker 1**: So some of the employee like for one day they have allocated multiple jobs on it.
**Speaker 1**: If you can see here for March 25th test, I think all this job.
**Speaker 1**: And then they allocated it.
**Speaker 1**: The eight hours is being allocated to this particular job.
**Speaker 1**: So when we tried it, it's just like.
**Speaker 1**: Like Jesse is the one updating or the employee is the one updating this timesheet.
**Speaker 1**: So like for March 31, they keep on entering those job and then the next day they will enter again the job.
**Speaker 1**: So what we are thinking if.
**Speaker 1**: Would that be possible if we can have this view so that like for that week he has this job and then he will just allocate the number of hours per day.
**Speaker 1**: So he will not.
**Speaker 1**: Or the employee will no longer kept entering every day and then allocate the time.
**Speaker 1**: And then it's easy for us also to see like if this view is available in notion, maybe it's per week and then per employee.
**Speaker 2**: So you want.
**Speaker 2**: I'm trying to understand exactly what.
**Speaker 2**: What you want.
**Speaker 2**: So.
**Speaker 1**: We want this view like because here in.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, so here I will.
**Speaker 1**: If I am the employee, so I will enter the the job and then the number of hours for the the same day.
**Speaker 1**: So March 31, so I have five job for March 31.
**Speaker 1**: So I will enter everything here.
**Speaker 1**: And then April 1, I will again enter the job, that five job.
**Speaker 1**: And then I will allocate the number of hours.
**Speaker 1**: So instead of doing this, if this is the view, I think I already have the dates here and then I already entered the project.
**Speaker 1**: So I'll just allocate the number of bars here.
**Speaker 2**: I have it pulled up looking real quick.
**Speaker 2**: Okay, so where is it date here?
**Speaker 2**: I'm just going to enter time and pretend that it was okay, so just add in three more.
**Speaker 2**: So you just want it to be grouped.
**Speaker 2**: I'm trying to figure out the grouping.
**Speaker 2**: So you want it to be grouped by.
**Speaker 2**: Can you show me your screen before.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, so group by employee.
**Speaker 1**: And then if possible, per week maybe because the timesheet or the pay period is bi weekly.
**Speaker 1**: So we have every two weeks.
**Speaker 1**: So.
**Speaker 1**: Or maybe one week.
**Speaker 1**: One week or something like that.
**Speaker 2**: Okay, let me.
**Speaker 2**: Let me play around with this and maybe we can jump back on and I'll see if I can set up a view to make it look like that.
**Speaker 2**: Like essentially the.
**Speaker 2**: That is exactly the same.
**Speaker 2**: It's just.
**Speaker 2**: It's vertic.
**Speaker 2**: It's showing it horizontally instead of vertically.
**Speaker 2**: So yeah, let me just.
**Speaker 2**: Let me just play around with this and then I'll text Maria.
**Megan**: Yeah.
**Megan**: And then Megan.
**Megan**: So when, for example, sorry, my daughter is here making noises.
**Megan**: So when Fritzi hit submit.
**Megan**: So what happened is that.
**Megan**: What was the view that Brandon got Fritzi, when you hit submit?
**Speaker 1**: This one?
**Megan**: Yeah.
**Megan**: So we don't know if.
**Megan**: I mean, what should be seen from Brandon?
**Megan**: Like once he hits with me, what should be the debut?
**Megan**: Like he should set something that says approved or.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, this.
**Speaker 2**: So that one doesn't show the status for him.
**Speaker 2**: So the only ones that he should be able to see are the status.
**Speaker 2**: But look at that.
**Speaker 2**: Field's not showing.
**Speaker 2**: It should only be the ones that show the status for leadership approval.
**Megan**: Okay, so it should be the status and then.
**Megan**: So it should show something that says approved, correct?
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, like, I think it's like pending approval or so it's not okay because.
**Megan**: We tried to test it, we tested today, and then when we hit submit, I think Fritz, he asked Brandon what he got and then he's just sent us this.
**Megan**: So we don't know if he actually got the view or if we should test it out somehow.
**Speaker 2**: Is he going to the leadership dashboard?
**Speaker 2**: Is that where he's looking?
**Megan**: I have to ask him.
**Megan**: I'll make sure though that he's looking on the leadership.
**Speaker 2**: I mean, I can look over there.
**Speaker 2**: Okay, so I'll look at that.
**Speaker 2**: Let me just play around with these views for a few minutes.
**Speaker 2**: It's hard for me to, like, test it and, like, talk at the same time.
**Speaker 2**: My brain doesn't work that way.
**Megan**: Awesome.
**Megan**: Yeah.
**Megan**: It's okay.
**Megan**: Don't worry.
**Megan**: So.
**Megan**: And you let me know again whenever if you.
**Megan**: If you need us to jump back again or if you want me to jump back again, I'll.
**Megan**: Will.
**Megan**: I will do it.
**Megan**: Thank you so much, Megan, for your help.
**Speaker 2**: You're welcome.
**Speaker 1**: Thank you.
**Megan**: Okay, we'll talk soon.
**Megan**: Bye.
**Megan**: Bye.
**Speaker 1**: Bye.
