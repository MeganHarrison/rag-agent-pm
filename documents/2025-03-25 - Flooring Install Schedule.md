**Speaker 2**: All right, let's do this.
**Speaker 2**: I got 22 minutes.
**Acannon**: Okay, we thinking start like in this hat, like up in this corner and then just work our way out.
**Acannon**: Or we can start in the conference.
**Acannon**: Like, we're probably not going to be able to start in the hallways and main areas first.
**Speaker 2**: How about we knock out the LVT first?
**Acannon**: Okay.
**Acannon**: Where's all the lvt?
**Speaker 2**: Student area, break room, daycare and laundry.
**Speaker 2**: So let's start in the daycare.
**Speaker 2**: Let's get the daycare knocked out.
**Acannon**: Yeah, because that student area might need till Tuesday or something.
**Speaker 2**: Daycare is a big area.
**Acannon**: That casework will be installed tomorrow.
**Speaker 2**: Just.
**Speaker 2**: I don't even think.
**Speaker 2**: I don't think you need to mark it up like this.
**Speaker 2**: Just do a.
**Njepson**: Few with the flooring install.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, let's do daycare first.
**Speaker 2**: Daycare and laundry room first.
**Speaker 2**: Then break room.
**Acannon**: And then break room.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: I mean, seriously, it's going to be better to just list it in order.
**Speaker 2**: Those flooring guys aren't going to look at this.
**Speaker 2**: I'M telling you right.
**Speaker 2**: I'm telling you right now, it's freaking email.
**Acannon**: And then so I can read it to save us time.
**Njepson**: Is it multiple subs trying to work in the same area?
**Speaker 2**: No, it's not going to be many people.
**Speaker 2**: There shouldn't be many people at all during this.
**Acannon**: Break room then.
**Acannon**: Student area.
**Speaker 2**: Yep, student area.
**Acannon**: Okay.
**Acannon**: Anywhere else get lvt?

**Acannon**: 122, 21.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, go 122, 121, 120.
**Acannon**: Into here.

**Acannon**: You want to go with these first or these?
**Speaker 2**: Doesn't matter.
**Speaker 2**: They're going to have those knocked out in two hours.

**Acannon**: This is polished concrete or this is just regular concrete.
**Speaker 2**: What?
**Speaker 2**: Where?
**Acannon**: Just regular concrete flooring in here.
**Speaker 2**: Where?
**Speaker 2**: Storage.
**Speaker 2**: 124.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, it's nothing.
**Acannon**: If it goes in here or not in there.
**Acannon**: I was thinking electrical.
**Acannon**: We don't do anything.
**Acannon**: Right.
**Acannon**: We're painting in there.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Acannon**: And we've got zero finish work down in there.
**Acannon**: Dwight, I need to.
**Speaker 2**: We have.
**Speaker 2**: We got the.
**Speaker 2**: Where we infilled the door.
**Speaker 2**: Done.
**Acannon**: That just leaves the vestibule.
**Speaker 2**: Vestibule is walk off carpet.
**Acannon**: Oh, and then.
**Acannon**: Then we want them to do the hallways or do we want to?
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: Corridors last.
**Acannon**: Should we do corridor and then vestibule?
**Speaker 2**: I just want it done.
**Speaker 2**: Got three meanings back to back.
**Speaker 2**: This is number two.
**Acannon**: Back and relax for this one.
**Acannon**: All right, that's good.
**Acannon**: So we'll say how many days for like one day for these three.
**Acannon**: Room three.
**Acannon**: These three classrooms.
**Speaker 2**: I mean, there's going to be a lot of prep too.
**Acannon**: Oh yeah.
**Acannon**: 11, 10, 9.
**Speaker 2**: We're gonna.
**Speaker 2**: They're gonna grind this down.
**Speaker 2**: Get rid of all the old nasty glue.
**Acannon**: Self leveler down too.
**Speaker 2**: Yep.
**Speaker 2**: That'll have to go down in 116 and 115.
**Speaker 2**: I know.
**Speaker 2**: 110, 111.
**Acannon**: Also right here.
**Acannon**: It's going to be kind of like a.
**Acannon**: Like slope down into the corridor.
**Acannon**: Yeah, a little bit.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: Kind of has to.
**Speaker 2**: They'll feather it out, make it disappear as much as they can, but it's going to be.
**Speaker 2**: It's going to be there.
**Speaker 2**: Fernville, Pennsylvania as well.
**Speaker 2**: Called Bum.
**Speaker 2**: You guys get all your credit card transactions coded Yeah, I did that on Friday.
**Speaker 2**: Receipts are in.
**Speaker 2**: I did well online.
**Speaker 2**: I had a receipt for every single one of them.
**Acannon**: Not fired then.
**Speaker 2**: Not fired.
**Njepson**: You have a credit card, Andy?
**Acannon**: Yeah, of course, bro.
**Speaker 2**: He was the third employee here.
**Acannon**: I only time I really had to use it for a big purchase was getting all.
**Acannon**: All those tapcon screws for you Crate.
**Acannon**: Maxed it out in two hours.
**Acannon**: Went to three different menards.
**Speaker 2**: I've maxed it out multiple times.
**Speaker 2**: Hell, I just maxed it out last month.
**Acannon**: I didn't do these.
**Acannon**: We'll just put these as day zero.
**Acannon**: I mean, they're not going to be able to get that.
**Acannon**: Daycare laundry room is probably going to take them a whole day, right?
**Acannon**: No.
**Speaker 2**: Yes.
**Speaker 2**: Dude, they got 10 days to do this.
**Speaker 2**: You don't have to slam it all into five.
**Acannon**: All right, Daycare, laundry room, one day.
**Acannon**: Break room, student area, one day.
**Acannon**: Your classroom.
**Acannon**: Yeah, I mean, if they're able to move at that pace, I don't see why they wouldn't be able to.
**Acannon**: That's half the amount of time.
**Acannon**: And then probably throughout the whole process, a day, day and a half of prep.
**Acannon**: All the day and a half, two days.
**Speaker 2**: I think it's going to be a day prep per area that you have, basically.
**Speaker 2**: Maybe not that much.
**Speaker 2**: Nick and I spoke to Mike earlier, so he's confident that they'll get it knocked out within the two weeks.
**Speaker 2**: But we don't need to screw them and say do it in five days.
**Acannon**: No, I'm not going to do that.
**Speaker 2**: Much rather have the time in there to do it.
**Speaker 2**: Will be, like, happy that they got it done before then and pissed off that they didn't.
**Acannon**: Get you there.
**Acannon**: All right, for my own sake, I'm a fill this all in.
**Acannon**: So I think we're good to go there.
**Speaker 2**: All right, let me see what you have again.
**Acannon**: Daycare and laundry room.
**Acannon**: Take a day.
**Acannon**: Break room, student area one.
**Acannon**: Day 122, 121, 121.
**Acannon**: Day 111, 110, conference room one.
**Speaker 2**: What is day 0.1?
**Acannon**: It's because I started my day count here and then realized I.
**Acannon**: I forgot to label these.
**Acannon**: I just.
**Acannon**: Just to save you guys time instead of redoing it all now.
**Speaker 2**: LVT is going to take two days.
**Acannon**: Yeah, that's what I have it as.
**Acannon**: Daycare.
**Speaker 2**: Well, then change carpet to day two.
**Speaker 2**: All your day ones need to go to day two.
**Acannon**: Yeah, everything.
**Acannon**: Everything gets changed.
**Acannon**: Like this will be 1, 2, 3.
**Njepson**: SA.
**Speaker 2**: So by the end of next week, we should have LVP done.
**Speaker 2**: And classrooms?
**Speaker 2**: 122, 123, 122 done.
**Acannon**: These little small offices.
**Speaker 2**: Nick, do you work from home most days?
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: Last week we worked in, in an office in St.
**Njepson**: Pete for a couple days.
**Njepson**: But I'm.
**Njepson**: I'm mainly at home.
**Speaker 2**: God, I'm jealous right now.
**Speaker 2**: This is week four of traveling.
**Njepson**: Getting an office here in St.
**Njepson**: Pete from what I hear.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, I know.
**Speaker 2**: Brandon was flying down last week or the week before to look at office spaces.
**Speaker 2**: All right, Andrew, I gotta hop into this other meeting.
**Speaker 2**: Nick, what do you think of this?
**Speaker 2**: You there bud?
**Njepson**: It's hard, it's hard for me to see my, my teams on my computers.
**Speaker 2**: Andrew, what the heck?
**Njepson**: Yeah, for some reason, for some reason it's not working on my computer today.
**Njepson**: But what was the issue?
**Speaker 2**: There's no issue.
**Speaker 2**: He's just wanting to go through like a flooring install plan like day to day, area by area.
**Speaker 2**: Okay.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: As long as you guys have it worked out.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: Starting, start with the lvp, move to classrooms, move to offices, move to corridors.
**Speaker 2**: Vestibule, boom.
**Speaker 2**: It's that simple.
**Acannon**: So, so where we're just keeping it regular concrete.
**Acannon**: Like all that's going to happen in there is just the fine during the final clean those clean the floor and leave it be.
**Speaker 2**: Correct.
**Speaker 2**: I mean they're still going to put base in there but yeah, you definitely need like two or three days for basins to own their team.
**Speaker 2**: But they can honestly that normally happens during punch list.
**Acannon**: So yeah, the base guys like they kind of.
**Acannon**: There's usually like one or two guys.
**Acannon**: No, I feel like they get flooring down and then do base.
**Speaker 2**: That's why I'm saying it normally comes during much less time.
**Acannon**: I was going to say this, this schedule we have, they're getting done on flooring install.
**Acannon**: Nine, eight to nine days.
**Speaker 2**: I just need to knock it out.
**Speaker 2**: They need to knock it out and then send out an email to everybody that still has stuff there.
**Acannon**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: So Glenmark, I'm pretty sure Dean's got most of their hit out.
**Acannon**: Yeah.
**Acannon**: What room do we want everybody to.
**Speaker 2**: Store stuff, get it out.
**Acannon**: If there are things though that need to be on site.
**Speaker 2**: Then they can move it around as needed.
**Speaker 2**: But I don't want much there.
**Speaker 2**: It's just stuff around.
**Acannon**: Bad enough.
**Acannon**: Good old Alex and Nick just going over the little game plan for flooring install next week.
