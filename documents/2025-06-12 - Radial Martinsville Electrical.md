## Transcript
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, I guess.
**Speaker 0**: Needed to know about, like.
**Speaker 1**: I mean.
**Speaker 0**: Do we need to put a transfer switch in or.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I mean, mostly.
**Speaker 1**: So what.
**Speaker 1**: So what's happening is they're currently in another space, right?
**Speaker 1**: And they have a generator there.
**Speaker 1**: So we're going to get this cage built for them and all this electrical done, and so we need to have either a temporary generator there.
**Speaker 1**: So.
**Speaker 1**: So when they move from one space to the other.
**Speaker 1**: One second.
**Speaker 1**: Hey, what's up?
**Speaker 1**: Oh, because Mike wants to get going.
**Speaker 1**: Yes, yes.
**Speaker 1**: We'll go with them.
**Speaker 1**: Let's get it all set up.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: And then we'll make a game time decision.
**Speaker 1**: All right.
**Speaker 1**: Thursday.
**Speaker 1**: Yep.
**Speaker 1**: Thank you.
**Speaker 1**: Yep.
**Speaker 1**: Thank you.
**Speaker 1**: Sorry.
**Speaker 1**: Brandon, you still there?
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: Can you give me two minutes?
**Speaker 1**: Yep.
**Speaker 1**: I was.
**Speaker 0**: Hell, no.
**Speaker 1**: I mentioned something to Brandon.
**Speaker 1**: He put in an order and just.
**Speaker 0**: Up and head out.
**Speaker 1**: So I'm here in the office, going south again, dude.
**Speaker 1**: My buddies at Westfield.
**Speaker 1**: That's fine.
**Speaker 1**: I mean, I.
**Speaker 1**: Like I said, I'm.
**Speaker 1**: I haven't left yet.
**Speaker 0**: You're trying to get under me.
**Speaker 1**: Well, I'm not sure.
**Speaker 0**: No, I'm not sure.
**Speaker 1**: I have so much to do that I'm trying to get, you know, things to a good point where I.
**Speaker 1**: I don't feel bad, you know?
**Speaker 1**: And then Brandon calls me, goes, you still have the office?
**Speaker 1**: I'm like, yeah, I am as of now.
**Speaker 1**: He goes, okay, I'm gonna need something.
**Speaker 1**: I'm like, well, what do you need?
**Speaker 1**: He goes, I don't know yet.
**Speaker 1**: Just hangs up.
**Speaker 1**: I'm like, what the.
**Speaker 1**: Yo.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I gotta let my dog out too if I'm leaving.
**Speaker 1**: Like, I'm not gonna leave till later today.
**Speaker 1**: So.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I was just gonna go home and let my dog out, but then I'm.
**Speaker 1**: I'm doing this with Brennan.
**Speaker 1**: So.
**Speaker 1**: You there?
**Speaker 0**: What's up?
**Speaker 0**: So are they moving into this space temporarily?
**Speaker 1**: No, it's going to be permanent.
**Speaker 1**: So.
**Speaker 1**: So here's some clar clarity for you.
**Speaker 1**: Look at this.
**Speaker 1**: Relocate existing generator from.
**Speaker 1**: So these buildings are right next to each other, right?
**Speaker 1**: Two buildings.
**Speaker 1**: AMEX is in one of them right now.
**Speaker 1**: We are demoing that building and all that stuff and moving them to this new space.
**Speaker 1**: So they have an existing generator that they're using.
**Speaker 1**: So we want a cost to either move that existing generator to the new space or just do a whole new one.
**Speaker 1**: Does that make sense?
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: And that.
**Speaker 1**: That being.
**Speaker 1**: And then obviously the.
**Speaker 1**: The circuits that you see on this layout now, it may be cheaper.
**Speaker 1**: So in the meantime, though, wow.
**Speaker 1**: Once we get them moved right, we need A temporary generator at the new space for them.
**Speaker 1**: So they, they aren't down at all.
**Speaker 1**: So what this is.
**Speaker 1**: They make gift cards, American Express gift cards here.
**Speaker 1**: So there's like millions and millions of dollars of products, little space.
**Speaker 1**: So they can't be going down at all.
**Speaker 1**: So that, that's essentially the idea now.
**Speaker 1**: Whatever the best way to do that is.
**Speaker 1**: I don't know, probably difficult to relocate a generator.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Speaker 1**: I kind of want to get it just give them a price for a new generator.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: I mean if they're going to stay in the new space, I think.
**Speaker 0**: What's the address?
**Speaker 0**: I'm gonna see if I can do an earthly.
**Speaker 0**: Because with the, with the generator comes a lot of site work.
**Speaker 0**: Like we gotta.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, I know.
**Speaker 1**: I mean it doesn't have to be a massive generator, I don't think.
**Speaker 1**: No power.
**Speaker 0**: 4.
**Speaker 1**: 400 to 800amps.
**Speaker 1**: Guess that's probably a big.
**Speaker 1**: Pretty big one, huh?
**Speaker 1**: I'm doing a bunch of them in Memphis right now.
**Speaker 0**: What looks like that.
**Speaker 0**: There's a.
**Speaker 0**: There's a photo of the panel that they sent me.
**Speaker 0**: Looks like this is 200amp.
**Speaker 0**: I wonder if that's all that needs backed up.
**Speaker 1**: I think that's all that needs backed up.
**Speaker 1**: So not like.
**Speaker 1**: Just like a small little gas powered generator should be fine.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Speaker 0**: But what about like the lights right now probably are also on that.
**Speaker 0**: They're gonna want the lights on the.
**Speaker 1**: Generator, I'm assuming Probably just the ones in their little.
**Speaker 1**: So I just looked up radial Martinsville.
**Speaker 1**: I know the address is somewhere.
**Speaker 1**: I just don't need that.
**Speaker 1**: This is what they're.
**Speaker 1**: This is a close up of what their space is going to receive.
**Speaker 1**: Here's my mark.
**Speaker 1**: You.
**Speaker 1**: You said you have this, right?
**Speaker 0**: Yes.
**Speaker 1**: Look at photos here.
**Speaker 1**: So here's the existing generator.
**Speaker 1**: Do you have access to all these photos?
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, I've got.
**Speaker 1**: So here's existing generator.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, that's the panel I was talking about.
**Speaker 0**: I mean that's.
**Speaker 0**: That's probably just a 200 inch panel, but it's also generator.
**Speaker 1**: Isn't that a big generator?
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, I mean that generator probably can handle much more than that one single panel.
**Speaker 0**: That's why.
**Speaker 0**: And that panel is a 120 panel.
**Speaker 0**: That generator is probably the 480.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So we'll have to step it down obviously.
**Speaker 1**: So I don't know.
**Speaker 1**: Whatever.
**Speaker 1**: Obviously whatever is the easier option.
**Speaker 1**: Like if we're just, you know, hooking up.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Speaker 1**: We would.
**Speaker 1**: We would rent a generator and hook it up.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Speaker 1**: To.
**Speaker 1**: To the panel and so it's ready for them.
**Speaker 1**: And then to get a permanent solution, we either move that one or we install a new one.
**Speaker 1**: So I need to know what's cheaper to just install a new one or to move that one.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 0**: Probably going to be based upon the lead time of the generator, which if we just did a small one.
**Speaker 0**: I don't.
**Speaker 0**: I don't think it will even be a lead time.
**Speaker 1**: How.
**Speaker 1**: How soon are they trying to move it's radio man?
**Speaker 1**: Yesterday.
**Speaker 1**: So can you get me a cost for what a new generator would be and then that'll help determine.
**Speaker 1**: Add that in there.
**Speaker 1**: And like I said, dude, it.
**Speaker 1**: You know, budget it.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Speaker 1**: If it's going to take you a long time, like, I can.
**Speaker 1**: I can throw a number together.
**Speaker 1**: I have a general idea of what a new.
**Speaker 1**: But I want, you know, you guys to do it, so.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, I mean, I can.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, I guess I'll probably just go off of like.
**Speaker 0**: I'll just be like 100 kilowatts.
**Speaker 1**: Well, but they have all that equipment too, so you can make it a little bigger, but it doesn't need to be able to power a whole freaking warehouse.
**Speaker 1**: You know what I mean?
**Speaker 0**: All right, is the.
**Speaker 0**: All those drops, all their equipment.
**Speaker 1**: Say that again.
**Speaker 0**: All the added power that they call for, like the quad receptacles, Is that for their equipment?
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, so that'll all be on the generator.
**Speaker 1**: This whole area right here, you see, that's all backed up by the generator.
**Speaker 0**: Okay, so their equipment is all just 120 volts?
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I can't imagine.
**Speaker 1**: I mean, they're printing cards.
**Speaker 1**: I can't imagine it being much more than that.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I mean, I'm not seeing anything here.
**Speaker 0**: In that warehouse.
**Speaker 0**: You know, where.
**Speaker 0**: Where we get power from to feed the new panel in this space.
**Speaker 1**: It's gonna be.
**Speaker 1**: It's gonna be close.
**Speaker 1**: I mean, over.
**Speaker 1**: This is the.
**Speaker 1**: Over here is the server room.
**Speaker 1**: But I mean, it's a.
**Speaker 1**: It's got to be close.
**Speaker 1**: I would.
**Speaker 1**: I would think, you know, if you want to.
**Speaker 1**: If you want to clarify within, you know, 100 foot or something or.
**Speaker 1**: I.
**Speaker 1**: I don't know how long this is.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, I was trying to think of like, where's the.
**Speaker 0**: Where's the switch gear at?
**Speaker 0**: It's on the other end of the building.
**Speaker 0**: That's nice.
**Speaker 1**: Shipping sorter.
**Speaker 1**: I mean, this is all dock doors.
**Speaker 1**: It's looking like racking.
**Speaker 1**: Here's cubicles.
**Speaker 1**: Training conference.
**Speaker 1**: Here's the electrical room.
**Speaker 1**: See it?
**Speaker 0**: Man, that's forever.
**Speaker 0**: What?
**Speaker 0**: I don't think they got more than that.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I would agree.
**Speaker 1**: Here, here's an electrical room as well.
**Speaker 1**: See this one?
**Speaker 0**: It's a little better.
**Speaker 1**: It is a little better.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, and here's an electrical room.
**Speaker 1**: Look at that.
**Speaker 1**: Even better, huh?
**Speaker 0**: Let's pl.
**Speaker 1**: I clarify that we're planning to pull from this.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 0**: And we'll have.
**Speaker 1**: And it looks like we can set the generator out here.
**Speaker 1**: So what we'll have to do, we'll have to do a temp generator.
**Speaker 1**: So it's already wired up for them for their panel and all this stuff.
**Speaker 1**: And then we'll either move the old.
**Speaker 0**: One.
**Speaker 1**: Or put a new one in.
**Speaker 1**: But obviously you need a transfer switch either way.
**Speaker 0**: Yes, Unless we can take their own transfer switch.
**Speaker 1**: Correct.
**Speaker 1**: But we'll price both options.
**Speaker 1**: Budget both options.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, good question.
**Speaker 1**: Would this help if I sent you this document?
**Speaker 1**: That way you have.
**Speaker 0**: I think what the other guy.
**Speaker 0**: I think what Kevin said, he was like a screenshot of that movie.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, well, does that help?
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: I got a better idea of what's title.
**Speaker 1**: Sweet.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: And I want to get him something tomorrow.
**Speaker 1**: So I'm gonna start plugging and stuff tonight.
**Speaker 1**: But the electrical, you know, this portion is the biggest kind of unknown.
**Speaker 1**: And then, you know, I'm going to swag some numbers here for.
**Speaker 1**: We're demoing an old freezer room.
**Speaker 1**: It's like a building itself.
**Speaker 1**: But I just want to make sure Kevin shared with you.
**Speaker 1**: You have access to all of these photos, these folders with the photos, correct?
**Speaker 0**: No, he didn't give me access to all that shit.
**Speaker 0**: I just got.
**Speaker 1**: Here.
**Speaker 1**: I'm going to copy this.
**Speaker 1**: Share this link.
**Speaker 1**: Copy link.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, so you have that now.
**Speaker 1**: And I'm just noticing here, look.
**Speaker 1**: Existing panel and new Amex area.
**Speaker 1**: So they have a panel that will be powering and that we're going to want to route everything to them on.
**Speaker 1**: Look at that.
**Speaker 1**: Which makes sense.
**Speaker 1**: And look, they already have a step down there too.
**Speaker 0**: So.
**Speaker 1**: Yes, this is this.
**Speaker 1**: This folder is existing panel and new Amex area.
**Speaker 1**: This is the new kick.
**Speaker 1**: This is where we're putting this new like caged area for them.
**Speaker 1**: So we'll want to reuse the lighting.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Speaker 1**: But just have it wired so it's specific to that Amex space.
**Speaker 1**: And then, you know, there's some server room work, which I can swag the server room work.
**Speaker 1**: I'm on that.
**Speaker 1**: So that makes sense.
**Speaker 1**: Now look at this.
**Speaker 1**: Temp generator set up for new space.
**Speaker 1**: When move is complete, then move generator over or price new.
**Speaker 1**: If rental and switch cost more, that makes total sense.
**Speaker 1**: Now.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Speaker 1**: So.
**Speaker 1**: So then it's saying the.
**Speaker 1**: The panel that's already feeding this area has other items that are fed if there's too many.
**Speaker 1**: And it will increase the generator size and price.
**Speaker 1**: A new.
**Speaker 1**: A new panel.
**Speaker 1**: I would go ahead and just plan on a new panel.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 0**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: We'll just start there, and I'll clarify that.
**Speaker 1**: That makes it easier on you, doesn't it?
**Speaker 0**: Yep.
**Speaker 0**: I'll.
**Speaker 0**: I'll start plugging away at this.
**Speaker 1**: All right.
**Speaker 1**: I appreciate it, man.
**Speaker 0**: Thanks, man.
**Speaker 1**: See?
