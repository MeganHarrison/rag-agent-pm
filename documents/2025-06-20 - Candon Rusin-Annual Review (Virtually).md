## Transcript
**Bclymer**: Delay on this.
**Crusin**: Okay.
**Crusin**: Yeah, I'll rejoin.
**Bclymer**: Hey, Brandon.
**Jdawson**: Howdy.
**Bclymer**: Canon was on here, but when I was talking to him, there was like a five second delay.
**Bclymer**: He'd say something and then if you wait five seconds, then you.
**Bclymer**: I could hear on the other line what I was saying.
**Jdawson**: It's odd.
**Bclymer**: Very odd.
**Bclymer**: But he's in a car on his phone, so.
**Jdawson**: Well, that's why I used to service.
**Jdawson**: Is he driving?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I think he went to lunch.
**Bclymer**: I just got off the phone with Maria, so she's changed them all from.
**Bclymer**: Every single one of them was at lunch.
**Jdawson**: She thinks we're all fat.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So is he getting back on or what?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Hey, Candon, I think you're muted.
**Bclymer**: There we go.
**Crusin**: Can you hear me?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: It always makes it so much easier to fire somebody when you can see them.
**Crusin**: Jesus.
**Crusin**: That's right.
**Crusin**: Going on.
**Jdawson**: Brandon, what's up?
**Crusin**: How much are you.
**Bclymer**: Good.
**Bclymer**: You can hear me now, too?
**Crusin**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Okay, good.
**Bclymer**: Literally can.
**Bclymer**: And I would say something and wait like five seconds, and then I would hear my.
**Bclymer**: It just.
**Bclymer**: Then it would be talking to you.
**Crusin**: Echoing back to you.
**Bclymer**: Weird.
**Bclymer**: Weird.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I mean, it's painful to listen to myself, so I don't like that.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, you should try.
**Jdawson**: Looking at you.
**Bclymer**: It's the whole package.
**Bclymer**: Call me Pig Vomit.
**Bclymer**: So I look like a pig and I make you want to vomit.
**Jdawson**: All right, let's get started.
**Bclymer**: So here's your review here.
**Crusin**: Guys.
**Crusin**: Got a good win last night, huh?
**Jdawson**: Oh, yeah.
**Jdawson**: Once White Lightning came out there, they started looking good, right?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Crusin**: Hopefully they can pull it out.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: Do you feel you're being compensated appropriately, you say?
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Do you feel good with where you're at, what you're making?
**Crusin**: I do, yes.
**Bclymer**: It's good.
**Crusin**: Learning a lot.
**Crusin**: So that helps.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah, it's.
**Bclymer**: I do remember back that far of just getting started and, you know, they shoved me on these jobs.
**Bclymer**: I really didn't know what I was doing at the beginning, but I was, you know, I worked.
**Bclymer**: I was fortunate to work for a company.
**Bclymer**: They were design, build.
**Bclymer**: They had.
**Bclymer**: There's a thousand people at this company and there was 600 of them were architects and engineers, and then the other 400 were the construction team side.
**Bclymer**: So I always had.
**Bclymer**: I was never afraid to ask an architect or engineer a question.
**Bclymer**: So that helped me a lot getting started.
**Bclymer**: But it was definitely my first ground up.
**Bclymer**: Like from then on, it was easy table.
**Bclymer**: So definitely we'll get there.
**Bclymer**: Have you made any costly mistakes?
**Bclymer**: You missed a flight out of state, so that's Minor.
**Bclymer**: You know, we're more looking.
**Bclymer**: And that's a good thing to, you know, travel.
**Bclymer**: I don't know.
**Bclymer**: Brandon, how much is spent on travel a year at Alito?
**Jdawson**: How much does the company spend?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, a couple.
**Jdawson**: Probably two, 300.
**Bclymer**: Or 300,000.
**Jdawson**: So, I mean, that's including not just flights, but stay rentals, all that stuff.
**Crusin**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: We'Ll probably be it, I think, you know, around between 2 and 250, I think, this year.
**Jdawson**: You know, try to project it.
**Crusin**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Number three.
**Bclymer**: So you're the only person answered this question correctly.
**Crusin**: I don't believe it.
**Bclymer**: Well, like, you know, a lot of people would write things like, that's really.
**Bclymer**: That's your job description.
**Jdawson**: I showed up on time.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I had the subs do what they were supposed to.
**Bclymer**: So, you know, that's, you know, that's a good way to look at it.
**Bclymer**: You know, that's your job.
**Bclymer**: So when it's, you know, when you go above and beyond, you know, you're trying to learn, you know, the estimating, and you're trying to learn the project management side of it.
**Bclymer**: And so that is, like, that's not in your job description as superintendent.
**Bclymer**: So those are things that, you know, I call above and beyond.
**Bclymer**: And, you know, just, you know, talking with Brandon, you know, one comment we have is, you know, when you are working on that side, it's not as much what you're directing people to do and coordinating people to do, it's what you're writing down and the accuracy of.
**Bclymer**: Of that.
**Bclymer**: So when you are helping with that, like, you want to make sure that, you know, you proofread it, you add the numbers all up and things like that.
**Crusin**: Yeah.
**Crusin**: Completed correctly the first time.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Crusin**: Gotcha.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I mean, and, you know, even, like, when we talk about, like, going above and beyond, like, if you think about the company as a whole, right.
**Jdawson**: Like, what does.
**Jdawson**: What's good for the company.
**Jdawson**: Like, so as a.
**Jdawson**: You always want to try to take things and anticipate what your boss needs, you know, in.
**Jdawson**: In your customer.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Whoever that is.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Like, so.
**Jdawson**: And, you know, in most positions, we have our actual clients, but then your supervisor is also your client.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Like, and that's where you got to anticipate their needs and do your best to, you know, meet those needs before they even ask.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Try to take as much off their plate as possible, because that builds more and more value.
**Jdawson**: You know, little things like, you know, like, you know, you did a really great job at Ulta Beauty, you know, during everything at Night.
**Jdawson**: Like, well, what are some of the things you did right?
**Jdawson**: Checklist.
**Jdawson**: Like what is the SOP that you did?
**Jdawson**: Like starting to, to build that stuff out so that other people can learn.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, that's the next one.
**Bclymer**: What you're doing well and like that number one, I tell you people and everyone else in the company likes working with you.
**Bclymer**: They respect you for your work ethic and what you do.
**Bclymer**: Brandon, he doesn't respect anybody but, but like going like over, you know, over and above on your reporting, like doing that daily and all the details you add to it, like that's, you know, that is over and above because no one, there's, we don't have a policy for that.
**Jdawson**: That's the standard that we want to be set.
**Jdawson**: And so those are valuable things.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So knowing that when you're in a situation like that where a client is, you know, they're on edge from previous experiences and you took away all of that worry and you know, any, anything on their mind.
**Bclymer**: So that's what's great.
**Bclymer**: It makes them want to give us the next job and give more work.
**Bclymer**: So that's very good.
**Bclymer**: You know, on site project execution.
**Bclymer**: You're, you're all over everything on your jobs.
**Bclymer**: Communication, leadership consist.
**Bclymer**: See it's all good, good stuff.
**Bclymer**: Your next work, can you improve project management skills?
**Bclymer**: Push to improve documentation things.
**Bclymer**: We just talked about knowledge of scopes, you know and like the only way to learn is get a job.
**Bclymer**: You know, you learn.
**Bclymer**: I never did a post tension building until I built Marina Bay and I love it but you know, I spent 20 over 20 years building stuff and never built that type.
**Bclymer**: You know, we're about to build a hotel.
**Bclymer**: I've never built a hotel.
**Bclymer**: So you know, we had a meeting with the architect, construction engineer yesterday and it's great to learn.
**Bclymer**: Like you know, they're talking about building a structure with concrete slabs and it's all supported by metal stud, structural metal stud framing.
**Bclymer**: You can think about that.
**Bclymer**: That's new to me and that's interesting.
**Bclymer**: So like you know, you get to go to that job or that you just got to learn everything you can about that and, and know there's 10 different other ways to build.
**Bclymer**: So that's how you'll build up your knowledge.
**Bclymer**: You know, in the MEP systems, you know, Brandon, myself and in hospitals and there's not much in a hospital that's they don't do.
**Bclymer**: You know, there's not many systems other than what that goes into hospitals, whether it's chilled water, you know, all the med gas systems.
**Bclymer**: So once we get into doing some healthcare, you can learn things like that.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, you're going to start to learn how, how important air pressure is and you know, standing, you know, this area has to be positive in relation to this area and why that's important.
**Jdawson**: Especially when you talk about like a surgery area.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: It always has to be positive in relation to everything around it so that no dust gets in the roof.
**Crusin**: Yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: Communication and presenting information to ownership.
**Bclymer**: What is, what do you mean by that, Canon?
**Crusin**: I, I feel like sometimes when I speak to higher ups, the way I present a lot of the information may start to become a little confusing and it's not clear all the time.
**Crusin**: So I think just the way I can present the important facts to them in a clean, decisive way so they're not confused at all when I'm done talking to them.
**Jdawson**: So a big thing with that, probably what I, my, my hallucination would be is even subconsciously it's proving your knowledge, right.
**Jdawson**: Like you're, oh, a lot of people over educate, right.
**Jdawson**: Just to say, hey, I'm smart, you know, I know something.
**Jdawson**: That's an ego thing.
**Jdawson**: That's a thing.
**Jdawson**: And so instead if you just put yourself in their shoes and understand that who they have to report to and what information they need, right.
**Jdawson**: Like they don't care about all that other stuff.
**Jdawson**: It's just thinking about what do they need because they already know that you know what you're talking about.
**Jdawson**: That's an internal thing of thinking that like, oh well, I got to show them that I'm knowledgeable.
**Jdawson**: It's like, remember we are the experts, right?
**Jdawson**: They already say, yeah, he knows what he's doing.
**Crusin**: Got you.
**Crusin**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So one thing, you know, you know, where, where can you improve, you know, asking, you know, I think asking better questions get a better answer, right?
**Jdawson**: So if you are constantly saying like, okay, how can I get 1% better today?
**Jdawson**: How can I improve on something?
**Jdawson**: Right?
**Jdawson**: Whatever that skill may be, whether that's networking, sales, construction, knowledge.
**Jdawson**: If you are constantly asking yourself that question, how can I get better?
**Jdawson**: What else do I need?
**Jdawson**: What am I missing?
**Jdawson**: Then that's going to help you get better at your craft.
**Bclymer**: Next, what manager does communicate?
**Bclymer**: Set clear tone, encourage growth and where can your manager improve?
**Bclymer**: Increase communication on big picture decisions and changes.
**Bclymer**: And maybe that's, I mean we don't have as many company meetings as we probably should just between everybody and maybe we need to set that up or at least every six months we're getting everyone together and Letting them know the things we got coming up, you know, the projects where people could be possibly going to.
**Bclymer**: But recently we've been getting so much thrown at us, it's hard to like the updates, like, we got three jobs today or whatever, so.
**Bclymer**: But I, I agree with that.
**Bclymer**: You're right.
**Bclymer**: I know I don't talk enough about everything that's going on.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, no, that's.
**Jdawson**: It is something that we, you know, quarterly meetings or something or just, you know, more communication that we can do, you know, for the.
**Jdawson**: From the top down.
**Jdawson**: So, yeah, definitely, you know, hear you guys loud and clear.
**Jdawson**: And that's something Jesse and I will.
**Jdawson**: We really, you know, work at providing and so that people kind of know the direction and where things are going.
**Bclymer**: I'm going to take a note on this one.
**Bclymer**: That's important.
**Bclymer**: Where do you want to be in five years?
**Bclymer**: Senior leadership role, managing larger projects, possibly a hybrid operations role.
**Bclymer**: Grow with the company.
**Bclymer**: I want to learn more response, earn more responsibility and trust.
**Bclymer**: Did we lose you, Candon?
**Crusin**: Yeah, briefly there.
**Crusin**: I'm back on, though.
**Crusin**: My phone overheated, I guess.
**Jdawson**: Oh, damn.
**Crusin**: But I can hear you now.
**Crusin**: I'm back on the computer.
**Crusin**: So you're good.
**Bclymer**: Cool.
**Bclymer**: So, yeah, I mean, everyone can, like, you grow at your own pace.
**Bclymer**: And so the quicker you gain the knowledge and, you know, show that you're a good person at managing, managing the projects you're given and the bigger projects you're given and, you know, we're growing at such a.
**Bclymer**: You know, what I see in five years is going to be insane.
**Bclymer**: So those people that you know and trust in the beginning or they got the biggest shot at advancing and taking on those roles.
**Jdawson**: So, yeah, yeah, I would say the biggest thing is like to.
**Jdawson**: To gain more trust and responsibility, then the things that you do have have to be done over the top.
**Jdawson**: Perfect to where anytime, you know, you're.
**Jdawson**: You're handing something to Jesse and I or asking for something, it's taken care of.
**Jdawson**: Because once that happens, then we.
**Jdawson**: We start to give more and more because so many people, you know, constantly say, I want to be here and I want more responsibility.
**Jdawson**: I want this.
**Jdawson**: But then Jesse and I look at things like, well, how do you want me to give you more stuff when you have these eight things that aren't done yet that you're behind on or aren't up to par?
**Jdawson**: Like, let's.
**Jdawson**: Let's get the, you know, first step first here.
**Jdawson**: Like, get this done.
**Jdawson**: Trust me, we want to give more people more stuff.
**Jdawson**: But, you know, if You've already got a handful of things that aren't getting done, you know, the proper way.
**Jdawson**: Like, I don't want to add more that don't get done the proper way.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: And so if you focus on getting those things done, you know, perfectly efficiently and everything, then it's, I mean, that's the fastest way to growth.
**Crusin**: Yep.
**Crusin**: You gotta have the, gotta have the base first before you can start building, so.
**Crusin**: Understood.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, go ahead, Jesse.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I was just gonna say that's it.
**Bclymer**: Like, I don't really want to talk about a lot of things I have to talk to with people about.
**Bclymer**: And I just, you know, as I got more experienced, like, I never had those questions or I never had people checking on me or making sure I had my stuff done because it was just done.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: And I was given every hard thing that they could throw at me for that.
**Bclymer**: So, like, that's where you want to be.
**Bclymer**: Like, it's.
**Bclymer**: There's no questions about anything.
**Bclymer**: You got that you're running.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Crusin**: Yeah, absolutely.
**Crusin**: I mean, that, that makes it.
**Crusin**: Obviously the goal is to make it easier for you guys to build trust, but I mean, obvious thing is going to make my job easier.
**Crusin**: You know, I don't have to get an email back saying, what is this, this and this, you know, you do it right, send it out right the first time and keep it moving.
**Jdawson**: Absolutely.
**Bclymer**: Next is how can I help you get there?
**Bclymer**: Continue to give me exposure to more complex scopes, high level conversations and the business side of operations.
**Bclymer**: Putting me in areas that will allow me to grow.
**Bclymer**: Feedback positive and critical allows me to understand what it takes to succeed.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I mean.
**Crusin**: Yeah, like we just said, making sure.
**Crusin**: I think my first stepping stone is making sure I'm doing all the baseline stuff correctly and getting that to you guys the right formatting and in the right way.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we're giving you opportunities to grow, you know, you just absolutely step into them.
**Crusin**: Yep, I agree and I appreciate that.
**Crusin**: Bringing me on, doing some of that project managing stuff and seeing what that's all about because it also helps in the field knowing, you know, both sides of it.
**Crusin**: So.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, absolutely.
**Bclymer**: And Nick's a great resource you have here because he knows how I like stuff done and he knows how to, you know, all the project management things he can do.
**Bclymer**: So, you know, you don't always have to come to me, but you do have people around that can help.
**Bclymer**: We just got a guy named Jesse that's going to start full time in July.
**Bclymer**: Great guy, lots of experience.
**Bclymer**: He'll be Another valuable person for everyone in the company that he's got a kick ass name.
**Bclymer**: Number one, he's badass.
**Bclymer**: He's about as unpc as me and Brandon.
**Bclymer**: He's a perfect fit for this company.
**Bclymer**: He told me a joke the other day.
**Bclymer**: Do you know why Helen Keller's dog left?
**Bclymer**: You would too if your name was.
**Crusin**: Helen Keller.
**Crusin**: She's got quite a few jokes about her boy.
**Crusin**: How old is the second Jesse?
**Crusin**: Number two.
**Bclymer**: He's probably in his 40s.
**Bclymer**: Not sure, I didn't ask.
**Jdawson**: Probably mid.
**Jdawson**: Mid to late 40s, I'd say.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, mid.
**Bclymer**: Somewhere in there.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: And he's coming on as a senior pm.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Perfect.
**Crusin**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, he's pretty cool.
**Bclymer**: He, he was out in alaska for like 5 or 6 years I think building mines, like the whole thing from the mine camp housing all that up there.
**Bclymer**: Pretty cool stuff.
**Crusin**: That's neat.
**Bclymer**: So last one here is.
**Bclymer**: What do you want to ask me that you haven't yet?
**Bclymer**: What do you see as the next step in me for the company?
**Bclymer**: Where do I need to improve immediately?
**Bclymer**: What am I doing currently that is holding me back from growing within the company?
**Bclymer**: I'll let Brandon start with this one.
**Jdawson**: So we talked about, you know, some of this stuff like you know, as far as growth goes, it's, it's when you're turning things into just CI or clients, it's.
**Jdawson**: It's that they're correct, right.
**Jdawson**: So like for instance, you know, I turned in, you know, we want a job in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Like I turned that estimate in I don't know, a couple days ago, right.
**Jdawson**: And they ordered it to us.
**Jdawson**: Nobody checked it.
**Jdawson**: I did everything right.
**Jdawson**: Like that's where you have to look at to get.
**Jdawson**: Is that just stuff it's done like you know, Jesse in the.
**Jdawson**: Whatever the one is next week that you're going to aspire.
**Jdawson**: I didn't check it.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Like I trust him.
**Jdawson**: Like he knows what he's doing.
**Jdawson**: And so that's, that's a, you know, a thing that you have to strive for.
**Jdawson**: And that's.
**Jdawson**: I know I always strive for it.
**Jdawson**: When I, when I used to work for Jesse like, like and I would turn something in and like if I missed something, I was like, like I double and triple check that to try to make sure that when I turn something in it was correct.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Because I hated if I made a mistake and he pointed it out and grilled me for it like a.
**Bclymer**: So it's got you froze up.
**Jdawson**: Can you there.
**Bclymer**: I think we lost candy.
**Jdawson**: We'll jump back on his computer probably died.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, something died.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Said I'm sure he'll bounce back on here in a moment.
**Bclymer**: I do think he answered the questions the best as far as like, what do we asking for?
**Bclymer**: You know.
**Jdawson**: I agree.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, he did needed really good, you know, about understanding the question and responding appropriately.
**Jdawson**: There he is.
**Crusin**: I'm sorry, guys.
**Crusin**: Everything's freaking getting too hot.
**Jdawson**: Turn the AC on in the car.
**Jdawson**: What are you doing?
**Crusin**: It is going sitting just enough in the sun, I guess.
**Bclymer**: Damn.
**Jdawson**: I don't know what's the last thing you heard.
**Crusin**: Things that I can do better, I think.
**Crusin**: And then you were starting to talk about a job that you had sent something out to.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so we won this Harrisburg job, you know, today.
**Jdawson**: So like I did that estimate, you know, turn it in a couple days ago.
**Jdawson**: Like nobody checked it.
**Jdawson**: You know, it was, it was just right.
**Jdawson**: Like I did it.
**Jdawson**: It was done.
**Jdawson**: Like Jesse did an estimate for the Aspire job that you're getting ready to go to.
**Jdawson**: He didn't send it to me to check.
**Jdawson**: Like he knows what he's doing.
**Jdawson**: And so that's what you have to strive for, is that you put out a great product, you know, to where you become the one checking other people's stuff.
**Crusin**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: So that, that, that's really where I see as far as like your next step, you know, for you and the company.
**Jdawson**: You know, as far as if that's, you know, more on the PM or the super side, that's, you know, more of your decision probably than ours and kind of where you want to go.
**Jdawson**: You know, the biggest thing is like, if you want to get into, you know, more of a PM role or a sales role or stuff, you have to do the things that that role requires.
**Crusin**: Yep.
**Crusin**: Absolutely.
**Crusin**: Gotta do the work before you get paid for the work.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: See, I mean the biggest thing like.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: What is holding me back from going to the company?
**Jdawson**: A lot of times when I see like you do like again with the stuff that I've seen or I've done, it seems like you're doing stuff to check the box instead of actually over delivering on it.
**Jdawson**: So like if you go back to like how you over delivered when you were on site for Ulta constantly, like you have to take that mindset with everything you do instead of just being here.
**Jdawson**: I did the schedule, you know, and just be done with it.
**Jdawson**: Be like, all right, well, I'm looking at this and this is fucked up.
**Jdawson**: This fucked up.
**Jdawson**: And you know, some of it's Just, you know, misspellings and other small details that don't take construction knowledge.
**Jdawson**: It just shows that you rushed through it and didn't proofread your work.
**Crusin**: Yep, understood.
**Bclymer**: And there's a lot of things like Brandon has mentioned, he's big into audio self empowerment, I don't know what you call that but self improvement, things like that, but just spending time because you can look up all kinds of stuff on project management, you can look up all kinds of stuff on different construction methods and types and products and like all those things.
**Bclymer**: Because if you don't want to spend years as a superintendent on a site learning how things are built and what things are made of, then you got to get that some from somewhere else.
**Bclymer**: If you want to be the, the best PM in the world.
**Bclymer**: If you've never spent some time on a job site, you're never going to get there because you'll never truly understand what it takes to build a project.
**Bclymer**: So you know, and if your path is a couple more years as superintendent and learning PM stuff as you go and then like, then you go into pm, you know, and MJ Harris I, you know, a great company, you know, their policy was you had, if you wanted to be a senior PM, you could have been a PM for 20 years.
**Bclymer**: You still had to go out and spend at least one year as the superintendent running a job before you could become a senior pm.
**Bclymer**: So you know, in the same sense like, you know, once you've got good field experience, you've got good PM experience, then you can go Senior pm.
**Bclymer**: You know, at some point we're going to need someone company wide that's just going to the job sites to, to see how the guys are doing, you know, make sure they're following safety guidelines and their job set up correctly and you know, they're you know, having all the meetings they should, you know, that's you know, a hybrid role.
**Bclymer**: I think maybe something you or alluding to doing something like that actually.
**Crusin**: Yeah, that's pretty much kind of the direction I was thinking.
**Crusin**: Now obviously you don't have anything positioned for that yet but hopefully with you know, gaining your guys trust and showing me being able to do the baseline stuff correctly, I can work towards something along those lines.
**Jdawson**: I mean and it's not, it's not just that like you have to think like before you get your eye on the prize and you know, think oh I'm going to get this, build it.
**Jdawson**: Like you need to check the ego and say I'm going to become the best.
**Jdawson**: Damn you know, superintendent.
**Jdawson**: And I'm going to teach others as much as I can.
**Jdawson**: Because when you're talking about stepping into that role, it's not coming in like they call it seagull management.
**Jdawson**: You swoop in and shit all over everybody.
**Jdawson**: It's about leading.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And that comes with experience.
**Jdawson**: And so you lead up and down the chain of command.
**Jdawson**: Like, and so you need to demonstrate and show that leadership because the knowledge standpoint is just one thing, but nobody wants to fucking work for an asshole.
**Jdawson**: Like, so you have to really work on leadership skills and make sure that you're really caring about people and doing that.
**Jdawson**: Because if you're just going after things for your own reason instead of betterment of the team, it shows.
**Jdawson**: But if you really focus and, hey, I want to help people get better and improve because I, I'm a team player and I care, that's really going to help you.
**Jdawson**: But you have to change that mindset.
**Crusin**: Yep.
**Crusin**: Makes sense.
**Crusin**: Managing people.
**Bclymer**: Think about it like a basketball team.
**Bclymer**: You probably don't know much about that whole culture, but, like, you have to play as a team.
**Crusin**: Yep.
**Crusin**: No, and I do.
**Crusin**: I do bring in those terms and that whole situation of basketball and being on a team, it's very similar, you know?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I mean, you look at the Pacers last night, they win as a team.
**Crusin**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: And that's.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Jdawson**: And that's what you, you know, how you, how you should be looking at things.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Like, you know, just building up, building camaraderie.
**Jdawson**: Like, you know, there is no.
**Jdawson**: Like, there is no.
**Jdawson**: Oh, there's only so many slices of the pie.
**Jdawson**: Our pie is getting bigger.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: So there isn't a race to the top.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Like, it's getting bigger.
**Jdawson**: There's plenty of pie for everybody.
**Jdawson**: And so just work on being the best you can do and helping others become the best they can be.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Crusin**: Understood.
**Bclymer**: Now that we don't have Lee, there's at least two pieces for everybody.
**Bclymer**: Because he would eat nearly half the pie every time.
**Jdawson**: He doesn't know who he is.
**Crusin**: Big old, big dude.
**Jdawson**: Jesse hates fat people.
**Jdawson**: That's why he didn't like me when I used to work for him.
**Bclymer**: Hey, I affectionately called him Tons of Fun, so.
**Crusin**: Oh, my God, Tons of Fun.
**Crusin**: Big old boy, huh?
**Bclymer**: He was.
**Jdawson**: He didn't miss meal.
**Bclymer**: See, Brandon tried to help him.
**Bclymer**: Offered him free gym membership.
**Jdawson**: And I even went to the gym with him.
**Crusin**: Wow.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I drove it 45 minutes to where he lives, to where he gym was five minutes from his house at, you know, five in the morning, you know, so I left my house, like, four.
**Crusin**: No.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Just to help.
**Jdawson**: And I offered free gym membership and, like, you know, whatever.
**Crusin**: That's a team leader.
**Crusin**: Gotta be healthy.
**Jdawson**: Well, he got.
**Jdawson**: He had two kids.
**Jdawson**: I'm like, man, like, don't you want to, like, play with your kids, like, in 10 years?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: What other questions you got?
**Crusin**: I think you guys pretty much covered everything.
**Crusin**: Yeah, I know where I stand.
**Crusin**: I know what I got to work on for sure know what you're looking for, so.
**Crusin**: I'm excited.
**Crusin**: This was productive.
**Crusin**: I'm glad we did it so good.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, well, like I said, we.
**Jdawson**: We both, you know, think highly of you, and, you know, I think you're doing well, and you got a lot of potential to keep growing and learning.
**Crusin**: Appreciate that.
**Crusin**: And I appreciate both of you guys teaching and learning and having some patience with me here and there, so.
**Jdawson**: Certainly.
**Jdawson**: Jesse, anything else?
**Bclymer**: No problem.
**Bclymer**: No, it's good.
**Bclymer**: Canon, glad you're here.
**Bclymer**: And the future is bright.
**Crusin**: That's right.
**Crusin**: Excited for it.
**Bclymer**: All right, cool.
**Bclymer**: Well, travel safe getting back, and I'll talk to the Monday.
