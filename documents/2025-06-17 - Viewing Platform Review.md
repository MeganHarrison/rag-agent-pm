## Transcript
**Brian.schubert**: Sa.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Morning.
**Jdawson**: Good morning.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Good morning.
**Ataylor**: How you guys doing?
**Jdawson**: How are you?
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: I'm good.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Good.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: So we got your sketch and your sketchup file and then knock off a couple of your questions really quickly.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we want to jump into it.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: So this is basically what they.
**Jdawson**: They want us to build.
**Jdawson**: It's going to be four of these on the.
**Jdawson**: In the warehouse.
**Jdawson**: And they have accepted this design.
**Jdawson**: So they just wanted us to.
**Jdawson**: To let them know the.
**Jdawson**: Basically the capacity, the.
**Jdawson**: The weight limit that you can hold.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Yeah, they're going to be having people.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: That's just people.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Right.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: They're not storing stuff up there.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, they're having people.
**Jdawson**: So they will be hanging TVs here, I think three TVs, 50 inch TVs and.
**Jdawson**: And these are workstations.
**Jdawson**: Basically put laptops here to work and same thing here on this end.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: So I think that platform, the actual platform area is roughly 8 foot deep by I think 27 long.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: When you take the stairs out.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I think when you take the stairs out, I think it was 20 by 20 by 8.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Okay.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: So you can have 16 people up there by code.
**Jdawson**: 16 people.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: And holding that weight is not a problem.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: We'll just have a structural engineer design that's all non combustible construction, it looks like.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: We'll just have them tell us what size the.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: The post and the decking and everything.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: That's not a huge load.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: So that's not a problem.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: So.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: And that, that's.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: I will call this an ancillary use to the overall s.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Occupancy because it's less than 10% of the floor area.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: But we always use the B occupancy egress ratio, which is one person for the housing square feet.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: So that's where we're coming up with the 16 people.
**Jdawson**: Gotcha.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: And then we'll have to file an amendment with the state because we've all already filed, obviously the project or.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Yeah, it's a statement script.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: So we'll file an amendment with the state.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: So I need to draw that up real quick and then get that in the state.
**Jdawson**: Gotcha.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: That all sound okay?
**Jdawson**: Yes, this sounds.
**Jdawson**: That sounds good.
**Ataylor**: And then is that just.
**Ataylor**: Is that.
**Ataylor**: Are those wood for the.
**Ataylor**: The little work areas there or steel.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Or the countertops or the countertop?
**Jdawson**: Well, the way, the way I have it now is basically metal framing on underneath and then wood on top of it for the counter.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Okay, that's.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: That's all fine.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: That flooring, interior flooring material may either Want to be plate steel or concrete?
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Let us know.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, it would be.
**Jdawson**: Are you talking about this floor or the floor underneath?
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Jdawson**: That's concrete.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Okay, perfect.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: You're good to go.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: So.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Well, I mean, I'm sure just because it's cheaper.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: You got everywhere.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: We'll use inch and a half deck and then a regular, you know, slab.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Nothing crazy.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Not like a composite slab or anything.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: And then this will probably be 6 inch post probably, I would imagine.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: But we'll check with the structure gear real quick.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: And then we'll need a foundation or anything.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: We just put them on a bearing plate on the floor.
**Jdawson**: All right, so when can.
**Jdawson**: When can we get recommendation from the structural engineer in terms of the metal?
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: I'll try to get it yesterday, but it'll probably.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: But it may be first thing in the morning.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: We'll want to submit as soon as possible.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Because I believe this one is a non full review right now.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: So they're gonna.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Even if they release the project before they get this, we're still finally on an amendment that's in.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: It's more on the Avon side.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: We don't want to mess up Avon.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Can you file that?
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: So we'll want to get that done as quick as possible.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: So this is not a big deal for us to draw up.
**Jdawson**: Okay, we'll do that.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: We'll have it drawn today.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: I'll just need the information.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: We'll need the information structural.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: So we'll.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: We'll call somebody after this call and just get the information.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: I'll stamp it on our drawings.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: We won't have him do drawings more than likely.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yes, it does.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Yep.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Can you send us this, the sketchup model there?
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: He did.
**Jdawson**: I think we got it.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I think that was.
**Jdawson**: That was Jesse.
**Jdawson**: He was on the phone somewhere, I think.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Oh, okay.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: I mean, you're just using the general lighting from the overall warehouse.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: The lighting up there.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Right.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Not do anything.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Special light.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: It's open.
**Jdawson**: Sorry, say that again.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: The general light for the warehouse would be fine for your lighting up there.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Unless you want some outlets along the counter.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: You probably need outlets along the counter, right?
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: They're just run conduit probably.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: I mean, it's all not huge.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: You can probably just find an open sort of like on there.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we might do maybe drop some codes here to distribute power.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: So we'll get this drawn up and send it to Dean.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Just so they can put some circuit that.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: In case the state asks, you know what I'm saying?
**Jdawson**: Right, right, right.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: We're familiar with the rails and all that.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: We'll get all that drawn.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: We usually do four foot stairs.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Even though you can get away with 44 inches.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Just because you're carrying stuff up and down there.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: If you're in a.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: If it is, it looks like that's what they're shown as are those four foot wide stairs.
**Jdawson**: I think so.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: But you can.
**Jdawson**: You can adjust as.
**Jdawson**: As needed.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: If you want the code benimum, we'll just do 44.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Saving 8 inches overall.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: I mean, it's a little less steel, right?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I think I have it at.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Nine and a quarter.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, you can adjust that as needed.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Yeah, we will.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Yeah.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: And then we have that located as well.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Yeah.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Where is that on the floor plan?
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Actually, I don't put that in the schedule.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: I didn't think I saw that.
**Jdawson**: Yes, I can.
**Jdawson**: Hold on, I can show you.
**Brian.schubert**: S.A.
**Jdawson**: So they're looking to put four of these in the warehouse.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Four of them?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: So these are the locations.
**Jdawson**: They call it command centers.
**Jdawson**: So here, over here.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: We have.
**Jdawson**: We have.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: That's on our drawing.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Those command centers then you sent us.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we have that here and here.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: Where those are those on the.
**Ataylor**: The CAD file that we have, do you think the command center.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: The latest one I sent you is this one and should be these four.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Okay, no problem.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Yeah, they're all the same.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: So we'll just call them out as a typical enlarged plan.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Yep.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Okay.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Not a problem.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: Thank you.
**Jdawson**: When.
**Jdawson**: Whenever you guys.
**Jdawson**: Whenever you guys find out about the member sizing.
**Jdawson**: So we can use that for.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: For pricing with the subcontractors, we'll call him this call.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: Thank you very much.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Yeah.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: See you guys.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Bye.
**Brian.schubert**: Bye.
