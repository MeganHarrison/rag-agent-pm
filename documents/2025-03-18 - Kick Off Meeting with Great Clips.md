## Transcript
**Devang.thakore**: Hello, Hello, Hello.
**Jwagoner**: Looks like we're just waiting on one more than had a.
**Nheinrich**: Good morning.
**Nheinrich**: Hey, Gary, I have the loads.
**Nheinrich**: I'm going to send it to you in about five minutes.
**Jwagoner**: Okay.
**Jwagoner**: Ramin, now that Eden's gone, you can get something done this week, right?
**Jwagoner**: No distractions.
**Nheinrich**: Yeah, I got the MEP90 this morning.
**Nheinrich**: The loads came in, so I'm just going to review those.
**Nheinrich**: The 100 is due end of this week, so hopefully things are coming together quickly.
**Nheinrich**: Oh, and then I was going to ask you.
**Nheinrich**: So now that you're going to go with the block retaining wash, should I tell the structure to take that concrete retaining wall out of his set?
**Jwagoner**: You, you know what?
**Jwagoner**: Just, just leave it as an option.
**Nheinrich**: Okay?
**Jwagoner**: Just, just make sure you note it as an option.
**Nheinrich**: Okay, go ahead.
**Jwagoner**: Well, I've run some.
**Jwagoner**: We've, I've got run some numbers on a concrete wall.
**Jwagoner**: I don't know that everybody was in, including the toe footing.
**Jwagoner**: That's why I would just soon leave that detail.
**Jwagoner**: So any conversation I have with alternates.
**Nheinrich**: All right.
**Nheinrich**: Yeah, I'll keep it.
**Nheinrich**: Your comment on that we at&t signage.
**Nheinrich**: No, no, this is a different discussion.
**Nheinrich**: Is this something I need to send to AT&T so have it ready by Thursday, that signage is by them or should we discuss it then with them?
**Jwagoner**: Yeah, right.
**Jwagoner**: Well, we got a meeting.
**Jwagoner**: Yeah, we're talking to them this afternoon too.
**Nheinrich**: Oh, okay.
**Nheinrich**: All right.
**Jwagoner**: Okay, we can, we can have that conversation.
**Jwagoner**: That was part of mark of 18.
**Jwagoner**: You should have gotten that invite.
**Nheinrich**: Say that again.
**Jwagoner**: Julie should have had the invite from.
**Nheinrich**: Oh, yes, I do.
**Nheinrich**: Yes.
**Nheinrich**: Yes.
**Nheinrich**: Okay.
**Devang.thakore**: Guys, I'm not, I'm not sure when Devon will be on, so we can go ahead and, and get going and I can fill him in if he ends up joining.
**Jwagoner**: Okay.
**Devang.thakore**: I know everybody's, everybody's time is valuable, so.
**Devang.thakore**: Yeah, so I, I, I do a lot of great clips across really just east of the Mississippi river.
**Devang.thakore**: And so I help a lot of new tenants or new franchisees with the construction.
**Devang.thakore**: And so we're, we're, we're a GC as well, and I've done a bunch of these little build outs for them.
**Devang.thakore**: And so I know enough to be dangerous on this one.
**Devang.thakore**: I know that you guys are building or currently building this building, Right.
**Devang.thakore**: Have we broken ground yet?
**Jwagoner**: We have not.
**Jwagoner**: We're still in for permit.
**Devang.thakore**: Okay.
**Jwagoner**: You for site work and I'm waiting.
**Devang.thakore**: Okay.
**Devang.thakore**: Okay, cool.
**Jwagoner**: March 31st.
**Jwagoner**: So after that we can go for our building permit, which will probably take all of April.
**Jwagoner**: So start Construction in May is the goal.
**Devang.thakore**: Nice.
**Devang.thakore**: And as far as your scope?
**Devang.thakore**: I'm not.
**Devang.thakore**: I haven't read like what the agreement is as far as landlord work.
**Devang.thakore**: Are you guys delivering a bathroom and ceiling or what?
**Devang.thakore**: What.
**Devang.thakore**: What's in your scope?
**Jwagoner**: Well, we were going over that a little bit this morning.
**Jwagoner**: We.
**Jwagoner**: I marked up the drawings the way Ramin had provided them to me and I sent it back to Ramin and we were discussing some of that this morning.
**Jwagoner**: Amongst my team, floor finishes are by Great Clips, paintings by Great Clips.
**Jwagoner**: We'll have the demising walls in for the office, the bathroom.
**Jwagoner**: Okay, I did.
**Jwagoner**: We did notice this morning that we were going to do two hair stations and I think there's maybe five or six.
**Jwagoner**: And I know that per the notes, Great Clips is providing the fixtures for those sinks, but we had agreed to do two, so I'm not sure how.
**Devang.thakore**: How great.
**Devang.thakore**: Are you talking about the hand wash stations or not the hand wash, the.
**Devang.thakore**: The hair wash stations?
**Devang.thakore**: Yeah, yeah, go ahead, Devon.
**Devang.thakore**: You only have two going in this one, right?
**Gdaub**: Originally we had planned for two, but because of the space, I believe the plan says only one.
**Nheinrich**: Yeah, there's only one.
**Nheinrich**: There's only one.
**Devang.thakore**: Okay.
**Gdaub**: So by standard design of a Great Tip salon, there will be two things for hair wash and about six or seven stations for haircutting.
**Gdaub**: Because of the size of the space, we are able to fit only one sink for hair wash and I believe it has six stations.
**Gdaub**: AJ Correct me if I'm wrong.
**Nheinrich**: No, that's correct, Yvonne.
**Nheinrich**: That's six hair cutting stations and one flex with a hair washing sink, correct?
**Devang.thakore**: Yes.
**Devang.thakore**: Yeah, that's what I saw on the Great Cliffs, John.
**Jwagoner**: Right, yeah.
**Gdaub**: So we total have seven stations.
**Nheinrich**: And.
**Gdaub**: One of them will be hair wash.
**Gdaub**: Now, I missed the question, or rather a concern that I heard.
**Gdaub**: Could you repeat that question again, please?
**Gdaub**: This was from the Rockford Structures.
**Jwagoner**: Well, AJ had asked a question about clarifying our scope of work and I was just trying to hit the highlights.
**Jwagoner**: You know, floor finishes are by Great Clips.
**Jwagoner**: Great Clips is providing the light fixtures.
**Jwagoner**: Great Clips is painting.
**Jwagoner**: And you know, we were talking about the wash stations, whether there was two, and now they're saying there's one.
**Gdaub**: Yes.
**Jwagoner**: So we just.
**Jwagoner**: Those sort of things.
**Jwagoner**: And I think we've previously had some conversation about data.
**Jwagoner**: I think we've got that covered.
**Jwagoner**: I don't know if there's any more questions about that.
**Devang.thakore**: So will you guys do the drop ceiling as well and the 2x4 LEDs in the drop ceiling or is that going to Be a great clip scope.
**Jwagoner**: I believe we're doing it.
**Devang.thakore**: Okay.
**Devang.thakore**: Okay.
**Devang.thakore**: Awesome.
**Jwagoner**: And then construction wise, obviously, you know, you know, as long as you've got your stuff available, you know, the light fixtures you know, available at the time, I'm assuming that won't be a big deal.
**Jwagoner**: And then A.J.
**Jwagoner**: you'll coordinate that?
**Devang.thakore**: Yeah, I'll.
**Devang.thakore**: I'll help.
**Devang.thakore**: I'll help Devon in coordinating all that.
**Devang.thakore**: The way great clips work is the franchise.
**Devang.thakore**: He.
**Devang.thakore**: He purchases all of that, and then my crew installs, or if you guys are doing the lighting in this case, your electricians can install and we can just coordinate, you know, whatever.
**Devang.thakore**: Whatever is needed.
**Devang.thakore**: So.
**Jwagoner**: Okay, how much time do you need for like when you order to us receive it so that we can make sure it's in on time.
**Jwagoner**: What's your time frame on that?
**Gdaub**: We have about three to four weeks of timeline for once it's ordered.
**Gdaub**: So if I get an AJ And I get an indication of when it will be needed or deadline for you to receive it so it can meet your timeline, I will order those things accordingly.
**Gdaub**: Okay, well, these are very important questions.
**Gdaub**: I'm glad you were asking it.
**Gdaub**: And AJ and I have a very same mindset that we want to align with your plan and take all the necessary steps so that we can all.
**Gdaub**: We all can meet our timeline.
**Jwagoner**: Okay.
**Jwagoner**: I will say on the agenda it says completion for construction.
**Jwagoner**: Our original goal was August to open, but with our prints, our full construction prints being delayed, it's kind of pushed us back.
**Jwagoner**: So.
**Jwagoner**: So it's probably looking the beginning of September to turn that over.
**Jwagoner**: So just.
**Jwagoner**: We're aiming for at least the end of August.
**Jwagoner**: But just keep in mind at this point that's a little bit flexible, depending on now how long it takes also to turn around permitting time, construction schedule once I get my permit.
**Jwagoner**: And so we need to.
**Jwagoner**: We'll keep the communication open.
**Jwagoner**: I'll put those details on the schedule as far as when we need the light fixtures and things.
**Jwagoner**: But it's too early for me at this point without that critical timeline of permit.
**Gdaub**: Right.
**Gdaub**: Joe, thank you for explaining the timeline for completion.
**Gdaub**: Wasn't the earlier timeline was end of June when we were discussing it in December.
**Jwagoner**: You have tentatively scheduled for May 15th.
**Jwagoner**: So things at that time, I think we are expecting the print sooner.
**Jwagoner**: So it's just kind of unfortunately not.
**Gdaub**: Okay.
**Jwagoner**: Worked out that way.
**Gdaub**: So my question, and AJ if you haven't asked this question, when you plan to finish by.
**Gdaub**: Did you say end of September or mid September?
**Jwagoner**: I think right now it's like towards the beginning of September.
**Gdaub**: Okay.
**Gdaub**: So maybe from whatever date that you have earlier anticipated maybe a week or two delay.
**Gdaub**: My question is would it be possible for us to or ages our crew to work inside while you are finishing it so that by the time the whole project is complete we can also be finished with our interior work?
**Jwagoner**: Yes, that should be fine.
**Jwagoner**: I would think we just need to make sure with the municipality as far as we're going to turn this documented for a full permit.
**Jwagoner**: As long as they don't have any issues with some of the items that would be added.
**Jwagoner**: Hopefully.
**Jwagoner**: Hopefully they won't.
**Gdaub**: Okay, so what I would need from you folks and not.
**Gdaub**: Not at this moment but timeline for when do you need the.
**Gdaub**: The great tip supplies from us so that I can order it and it can arrive on time and also a destination where it can be received.
**Jwagoner**: Yep.
**Devang.thakore**: And we're.
**Devang.thakore**: We're a few months away from that Devon so so we can.
**Devang.thakore**: We could cross that bridge when we get to it as far as like delivery and if I have to receive it I can and.
**Devang.thakore**: And get it out there so we don't.
**Jwagoner**: True.
**Gdaub**: I know Asia.
**Gdaub**: My main.
**Gdaub**: My intention for.
**Devang.thakore**: Is to.
**Gdaub**: For them to put pencil in the timeline the lead time that we would need to acquire all these supplies so that it can reach there for them to finish it.
**Gdaub**: So as they're preparing their plan I would like them to consider the time that we will need to acquire it so they can let us know ahead of time and we can order it and have it available rather than rushing it at the last minute.
**Jwagoner**: Definitely we will get that put in our schedule that we're.
**Jwagoner**: We're in the process of and let you guys know as soon as we get permits.
**Jwagoner**: It's a go with what that looks like.
**Gdaub**: Yeah that will certainly be helpful.
**Jwagoner**: Okay.
**Devang.thakore**: Is as far as scope goes.
**Devang.thakore**: So these stations we have to pull a whip from the wall into the the haircutting station and that's where our.
**Devang.thakore**: Our quad outlet comes from.
**Devang.thakore**: Are as far as Rockford Scope from an electrical standpoint.
**Devang.thakore**: Is it just lighting in the drop ceiling and do my electricians need to do all the other electrical shown or what?
**Devang.thakore**: Where did we land on that?
**Devang.thakore**: Have you guys seen the Great Clips drawing?
**Jwagoner**: Yeah, we've got it in front of us.
**Jwagoner**: Yes, that that's correct.
**Jwagoner**: We're doing the ceiling and the lighting.
**Devang.thakore**: Okay.
**Nheinrich**: That's one of my question was initially is what is provided and installed by Great Clips.
**Nheinrich**: Your drawings mentioned supplied by but there is nothing that says installed by whoms for example, these haircutting stations are you is the Great Clips team installs their own casework and their electrician, either Rockford electrician or your electrician will then install the quads and everything as long as the power is provided.
**Nheinrich**: Is there any way we can go through that list?
**Nheinrich**: Not now.
**Nheinrich**: If you have, if you have time now or maybe maybe in separate email you guys can tell me or until Rockford of course what is provided and installed by Great Clips.
**Devang.thakore**: Yeah, so we could definitely.
**Devang.thakore**: I don't know as far, yeah, I don't know as far as what the lease agreement is between Great Clips and whoever the landlord is.
**Devang.thakore**: And so a lot of times I guess I haven't seen the landlord work agreement and so sometimes landlords will cover, you know, outlets in the demising wall.
**Devang.thakore**: Sometimes my electricians have to come in and pull from the panels.
**Devang.thakore**: So it really is just a matter of what the agreement is in the lease and then, and then we can kind of work from there and we, we basically pick up the pieces and remain.
**Jwagoner**: I, I have that work letter.
**Jwagoner**: I know the work letter.
**Jwagoner**: I'm happy to go over that with you once we're off this meeting.
**Nheinrich**: Okay.
**Nheinrich**: Just, just so I can pick up on Gary's markups to say exactly what is by Great Clips.
**Nheinrich**: So the Great Clips team also know what they need to provide and install.
**Nheinrich**: Is it just.
**Devang.thakore**: Yeah.
**Devang.thakore**: So go ahead.
**Devang.thakore**: So those Great Clips drawing, that's.
**Devang.thakore**: That's for like the build out gc.
**Devang.thakore**: So, so me.
**Devang.thakore**: So when they say supplied by Great Clips that's telling me that I still have to install it.
**Devang.thakore**: So all those fixtures you see I'll install obviously the Great Clip standard flooring paint schedule, their specialty fixtures usually my guys will install.
**Nheinrich**: Yeah, yeah, I think that's what you brought it up AJ Is the.
**Nheinrich**: There's the part that has electric in it.
**Nheinrich**: So that's the part that needs to be clarified.
**Nheinrich**: Is it Rockford electrician or your guys's electrician specifically those hair cutting stations.
**Gdaub**: So we would, we will have the stations purchased obviously and those will be installed by Aegis crew but certainly needs all the electrical outlet and the, the plumbing outlet or sewage outlets.
**Gdaub**: Those needs to be certainly be done by Rockford if that makes sense.
**Devang.thakore**: Yeah.
**Devang.thakore**: If Rockford's building the walls it would make.
**Devang.thakore**: That would make sense for Rockford's electricians to do all the in wall as well.
**Jwagoner**: Right.
**Devang.thakore**: That way we're not.
**Devang.thakore**: That way we're not cutting up the walls.
**Jwagoner**: Yeah.
**Jwagoner**: And I think we have some coordination in scope in that regard.
**Devang.thakore**: Okay.
**Jwagoner**: And so as I'm sitting here looking through it, I just whispered to Garrett, I think there may be good fit here, AJ if you gave us some pricing to do our landlords work inside this space.
**Devang.thakore**: Okay.
**Jwagoner**: Because you're, I mean, you know great clips way better than we do, obviously.
**Jwagoner**: And you know, when Gary was talking about, yeah, there's outlets that we're not roughing in that should be roughed in with the.
**Jwagoner**: Before the drywall goes on, but then we're putting the drywall on.
**Jwagoner**: There's no sense for anybody wasting money to have to do a scope of work prematurely, if that makes sense.
**Gdaub**: Oh, yeah, that's totally.
**Gdaub**: I, I totally.
**Gdaub**: And, and so first of all, I, I would say I really appreciate the way we are managing and handling this project because it'll make everyone's life much easier and will save a lot of time and money.
**Gdaub**: So AJ and I are truly excited about how we are handling these projects.
**Gdaub**: We have done other works and this is probably the, the gold standard, I would say, so far, the way we are progressing.
**Gdaub**: So I completely agree with you.
**Jwagoner**: Oh, good.
**Jwagoner**: And we appreciate that.
**Jwagoner**: That's our goal, is to make it quick and easy.
**Jwagoner**: So I would say this, AJ Let us kind of discuss where we think we can make a good, clean cut off with our crews and then, and maybe we'll come up with a scope of work then for you so we can start the discussion.
**Jwagoner**: You can help guide that discussion based on your knowledge of great clips as well.
**Devang.thakore**: Yeah, that, that works for me.
**Devang.thakore**: And you know, I'm here to be a tool for Devon and to help you guys as well with, with these great clips build out.
**Devang.thakore**: So you, where are you located, guys?
**Devang.thakore**: So we have an Indianapolis office and a Tampa Bay office.
**Devang.thakore**: I kind of split time between the two.
**Devang.thakore**: But then we're licensed all over and so we, we kind of just go.
**Devang.thakore**: Go where they need us.
**Jwagoner**: And, and are you using, are you using local labor?
**Jwagoner**: Are you bringing crews across the country?
**Devang.thakore**: It, it, it honestly, it just depends on what makes sense to make the, the deal pencil for everybody.
**Devang.thakore**: So anytime I'm breaking into a new market, you know, I, I get boots on the ground interviewing subcontractors, and then I honestly rely on guys like you too.
**Devang.thakore**: And so there's a lot of, A lot of moving parts, and it really just depends on the deal.
**Devang.thakore**: So.
**Jwagoner**: Yeah, well, I'm sure, I mean, we've been on the ground there and, and you know, as, as is the case everywhere there's, there's good trades, there's bad Trades.
**Jwagoner**: There's trades that are busy right now.
**Jwagoner**: There's trades that have time.
**Jwagoner**: So.
**Jwagoner**: Yeah, we should each other in that regard too.
**Devang.thakore**: For sure.
**Devang.thakore**: Yeah.
**Devang.thakore**: And.
**Devang.thakore**: And if we needed to hop on a separate call guys, and we can really walk through, you know, I would love to see the drawings of the actual building that you guys are.
**Devang.thakore**: Are getting ready to build.
**Devang.thakore**: I.
**Devang.thakore**: I don't think I.
**Devang.thakore**: I've just seen CAD so far and.
**Devang.thakore**: And like I said, we can, we can go from there and I'm here to help, so.
**Jwagoner**: All right.
**Jwagoner**: Thank you, A.J.
**Jwagoner**: i think a while ago I added you.
**Jwagoner**: We use Procore for our construction software.
**Nheinrich**: I'm not sure.
**Devang.thakore**: Yes.
**Jwagoner**: Have you gotten an invite or.
**Jwagoner**: Because we do have drawings on there.
**Jwagoner**: The drawings that we have today, are they.
**Devang.thakore**: Are they in Procore?
**Jwagoner**: Yeah.
**Jwagoner**: Yeah.
**Devang.thakore**: Okay.
**Devang.thakore**: Yeah.
**Devang.thakore**: Yeah.
**Devang.thakore**: I haven't.
**Devang.thakore**: I haven't hopped into your portal on Procore, but I'm on Procore, so I can, I can jump in there and take a peek.
**Devang.thakore**: Okay.
**Nheinrich**: I know the van has to leave by 9:30.
**Nheinrich**: If you guys.
**Nheinrich**: I have a couple of questions to go over with the Eclipse team, if that's okay.
**Nheinrich**: If you guys are finished with one item that I'm still not clear about, is this stackable washer dryer.
**Nheinrich**: Your plan says by landlord.
**Nheinrich**: I think the washer dryer should be by.
**Nheinrich**: Great Clips.
**Nheinrich**: Is that agreeable?
**Nheinrich**: Or do you guys want the landlord to buy this stackable washer dryer?
**Gdaub**: I think it's.
**Gdaub**: I think it's our greatest responsibility, but I would double check my, My lease document, but for.
**Gdaub**: For now we could say it's.
**Gdaub**: It's a great responsibility.
**Nheinrich**: And if you don't mind the bank when you find it, if you send it to me, I just want to make sure there's enough space between the, between the utility sink and the wall.
**Nheinrich**: The way it's located, I know it's not any larger than that, but just to make sure, if you don't mind, once you.
**Nheinrich**: Once you find out the cut sheet and I'll.
**Gdaub**: What would you like me to share?
**Gdaub**: Sorry?
**Nheinrich**: Oh, the.
**Nheinrich**: The cut sheet for the washer dryer.
**Nheinrich**: Once you.
**Nheinrich**: Once it's agreed or once you know what model you're using for the stackable washer dryer, if you send me the cut sheet, I want to make sure there's enough space between the utility sink and the wall for that to fit.
**Gdaub**: Ramin, if you don't mind, tell me what's.
**Gdaub**: What's the cut sheet that you're referring to?
**Nheinrich**: Oh, the dimension.
**Nheinrich**: The dimension of the washer dimensions.
**Gdaub**: Okay.
**Nheinrich**: Okay.
**Gdaub**: I will.
**Gdaub**: I'll look it up.
**Nheinrich**: Specifically the width of it.
**Jwagoner**: Yeah.
**Nheinrich**: If there's any specific.
**Nheinrich**: And then the other item on your electrical on your ceiling plan on sheet A2 you have a switch that's called out for a track lighting.
**Nheinrich**: There is no track lighting shown on the plan.
**Nheinrich**: Is this something that we don't need in your space?
**Nheinrich**: We have can lights and two by fours light fixtures but no track lighting.
**Nheinrich**: But there's a specific switch for it.
**Nheinrich**: So I, I told the engineer to put it in for now.
**Nheinrich**: But if you don't need it, we can take it out or leave it in and then track learning can be added later.
**Devang.thakore**: I would, I would leave it in the.
**Gdaub**: Yeah.
**Devang.thakore**: The track lighting is, is.
**Devang.thakore**: It's great clip.
**Devang.thakore**: Standard design.
**Devang.thakore**: So I'll have to look at the drawings closer.
**Nheinrich**: Okay.
**Devang.thakore**: Because sometimes they're.
**Devang.thakore**: They're hiding on there and you can't see it and so I'll take a peek and if you don't mind, let me know.
**Nheinrich**: I left it in for now, but I.
**Nheinrich**: But since I didn't see any fixtures, I'm sure the electrical drawings I have so far don't show any of that.
**Devang.thakore**: Okay.
**Nheinrich**: Whenever you get a chance.
**Nheinrich**: And there is a couple other things.
**Nheinrich**: Like on your symbols you have a power pack symbol under the legend.
**Nheinrich**: But there is no power pack on the ceiling plan.
**Nheinrich**: And also There is no 360 direction.
**Nheinrich**: There's another symbol.
**Nheinrich**: Again, I don't know if those are just general symbols you have on your plans.
**Nheinrich**: I'm not necessarily specific to this job but was those, were those missed on the ceiling plan?
**Nheinrich**: Specifically the power pack and 360 degree directional camera maybe.
**Nheinrich**: I'm not sure what that is exactly.
**Nheinrich**: So.
**Jwagoner**: Yeah.
**Devang.thakore**: So great clips has like a standard drawing set.
**Devang.thakore**: And so sometimes depending on the site, depending on the owner, things don't make it on.
**Devang.thakore**: On the drawings.
**Devang.thakore**: But that, that legend will stay the same.
**Devang.thakore**: Just depends on the location.
**Nheinrich**: Okay.
**Nheinrich**: Anyway, if you don't mind that sheet A two just electrical drawing and then let me know if, if it's good for you.
**Nheinrich**: That's fine.
**Nheinrich**: That's what we have.
**Nheinrich**: That's what we went by is by the cat drives we received.
**Nheinrich**: But if there's anything to be added, let me know.
**Devang.thakore**: Yeah, a lot of time like the, with these build outs the, the biggest coordination piece is the electrical because there's.
**Devang.thakore**: There's a lot of electrical involved in just a little space with these things.
**Devang.thakore**: So.
**Nheinrich**: And then the flooring is by Great clips.
**Nheinrich**: Right.
**Nheinrich**: So the transition Strips, car.
**Nheinrich**: Everything is by great clips.
**Nheinrich**: You provide material.
**Devang.thakore**: Okay.
**Nheinrich**: Yeah, we'll.
**Devang.thakore**: We'll provide and install that you uninstall.
**Nheinrich**: Okay.
**Nheinrich**: Oh, and then the, the utility room at this point has no finish.
**Nheinrich**: You left it up to the owner to come up with the finish.
**Nheinrich**: I was going to leave it as sealed concrete or just concrete.
**Nheinrich**: Gary, is up to you too.
**Nheinrich**: Do you want a VCT in there?
**Nheinrich**: You leave it concrete.
**Nheinrich**: Sealed concrete.
**Nheinrich**: Well, that's a utility room where the washer dryer goes where the utility sink is.
**Jwagoner**: That's up to great clips on there.
**Jwagoner**: What they want from floor.
**Nheinrich**: Yeah, it drives.
**Nheinrich**: Is specified by owner, so they pass it on to you.
