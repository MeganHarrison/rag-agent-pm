## Transcript
**Bclymer**: Hi, aj how are you?
**Fnjie**: Hi, everybody.
**Fnjie**: Hi, Maria.
**Fnjie**: How you doing?
**Bclymer**: All good.
**Fnjie**: Hey, Maria.
**Bclymer**: Hi, guys.
**Bclymer**: How are you?
**Justin**: I'm good.
**Bclymer**: How are you?
**Bclymer**: Oh, good.
**Bclymer**: I think.
**Bclymer**: Brendan.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, he's here.
**Fnjie**: Fatima, are we waiting for Justin or can we get started?
**Justin**: I think we can get started.
**Justin**: I'll.
**Justin**: I'll send him a message.
**Fnjie**: All right, Excellent.
**Fnjie**: All right.
**Asupit**: What's going on?
**Fnjie**: Brandon, how you doing?
**Asupit**: What's up?
**Asupit**: All right, I sent you all those purchase agreements.
**Asupit**: Did you get them?
**Fnjie**: Say that one more time.
**Bclymer**: I already.
**Bclymer**: I already sent them to Kevin.
**Kjin**: Cool.
**Fnjie**: Oh, the.
**Fnjie**: The.
**Fnjie**: For the vehicle.
**Fnjie**: Yeah, we got it a couple minutes ago.
**Fnjie**: All right, excellent.
**Fnjie**: So we talked with Fatima earlier this morning on the revenue and the cost and the jobs that were going on.
**Fnjie**: So she's still working through.
**Fnjie**: Working through that.
**Fnjie**: Once we have that, obviously, we'll.
**Fnjie**: We'll do our selections and our testing, send out the confirmations that we talked about.
**Fnjie**: Brandon.
**Fnjie**: But that's.
**Fnjie**: That's the biggest piece that we need.
**Fnjie**: But it seems like, I don't know if a team.
**Fnjie**: If you have an estimate on time on that, potentially, yes.
**Justin**: I'm gonna keep working on it, you know, today and, and tomorrow, hopefully get it all done.
**Justin**: All done today.
**Justin**: If not, I'll definitely continue working on it tomorrow, but it won't be passed tomorrow.
**Fnjie**: Okay, excellent.
**Fnjie**: So we're.
**Fnjie**: We're on standby.
**Fnjie**: Once we get that, then we'll obviously do our selections and everything.
**Fnjie**: Justin, Brandon, I'll.
**Fnjie**: I'll need you guys just to take a second look at it before it gets to us so you can catch anything and do some blocking and tackling before it gets to us, please.
**Fnjie**: Very good.
**Fnjie**: That.
**Fnjie**: That was the biggest one.
**Fnjie**: Kevin, do you want to share the smartsheet and see where we're at?
**Fnjie**: Kevin, you're muted whenever you get a chance.
**Kjin**: Oh, yes.
**Kjin**: Just sharing this.
**Kjin**: March it now and then.
**Fnjie**: All right, very good.
**Fnjie**: You want to start at the top?
**Kjin**: Yes.
**Fnjie**: So everything is green or blue, which is good.
**Kjin**: Yeah.
**Kjin**: We are waiting the bank reconciliation workpaper.
**Kjin**: I remember we.
**Kjin**: We already performed the bank recon for 2023, but looks like we thought we noted the variance and then our staff.
**Kjin**: Jason has left the comments to Fatima.
**Kjin**: It was probably yesterday or two days ago.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Kjin**: Yeah, let's check.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Kjin**: Yeah.
**Kjin**: After we tie everything, we're going to make some selections for outstanding lists and then deposit and transit.
**Kjin**: And then we are waiting fixed asset roll forward schedule from 2022, roll to.
**Kjin**: Roll it to 2023, roll it to 2024.
**Fnjie**: That's just going to be the three vehicles.
**Kjin**: Yeah.
**Kjin**: And then.
**Fnjie**: So, I mean, Justin and Fatima don't spend a lot of time on that.
**Fnjie**: Take whatever we bought it for and then depreciate it over whatever the three or five years.
**Fnjie**: I.
**Fnjie**: I forget what the vehicle life is, but that one.
**Fnjie**: And then book the adjustment for 23 and 24.
**Fnjie**: Now that would be a quick test for us.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay, Fatima, you got that?
**Kjin**: Yep.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: EP and all that.
**Fnjie**: All right.
**Fnjie**: Members Equity.
**Fnjie**: Sorry, Kevin.
**Fnjie**: Is that the next one?
**Kjin**: Yeah, this is the next one.
**Fnjie**: Okay, excellent.
**Fnjie**: So, yeah, I saw your note there, Brandon.
**Fnjie**: So there's a couple things we see on the balance sheet that we wanted to.
**Fnjie**: To make sure we're covered on.
**Fnjie**: So it looks like when you first started the company, you put in 60k.
**Asupit**: Yeah.
**Fnjie**: Okay, so that's what we just kind of want to verify.
**Fnjie**: If there's a bank statement associated with that, then great.
**Fnjie**: If not, you know, we'll just add it to the rep letter at the end.
**Fnjie**: You can just confirm that you paid 60k upfront.
**Fnjie**: Whatever's easier.
**Asupit**: Yeah, I mean, I.
**Asupit**: I doubt I'll have a bank statement that shows that that's a.
**Asupit**: That account got hacked and we have a new one.
**Fnjie**: So.
**Asupit**: Yeah.
**Fnjie**: Oh, okay.
**Fnjie**: Yeah, I'll just add it in the rep.
**Fnjie**: You'll sign it.
**Fnjie**: Done.
**Fnjie**: Excellent.
**Fnjie**: Distributions for at least the bank statement.
**Fnjie**: That or the bank that's active now, the one that wasn't hacked.
**Fnjie**: We'll need to see when those were distributed out to you.
**Fnjie**: So if you can, we can send you the list.
**Fnjie**: Or if you have it, we can ticket or tick and tie it to the bank and we're done there.
**Fnjie**: It's a pretty quick one.
**Asupit**: I mean, I would think, you know, if a team.
**Asupit**: Is that like, can't you just run a report and sync that up?
**Asupit**: I mean, like.
**Asupit**: Like, I don't know.
**Asupit**: Like, I.
**Asupit**: I don't.
**Asupit**: I don't have a set distribution.
**Asupit**: Like, oh, I take it every quarter.
**Asupit**: I take 10 grand or whatever.
**Asupit**: Like, I just, you know, as needed, kind of take it.
**Justin**: I'll run a report and.
**Justin**: And then go.
**Justin**: Go over it.
**Justin**: Well, with Brandon.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: Yeah.
**Fnjie**: I mean, if it's a.
**Fnjie**: A handful of distributions, like 3, 4, 5, maybe just send all the bank statements associated with them, but if there are more, then we'll just pick a few.
**Fnjie**: Sorry, can you go up.
**Fnjie**: Kevin?
**Fnjie**: Shareholder receivable.
**Fnjie**: Brandon, there's a shareholder receivable.
**Fnjie**: I think it's 500k on the balance sheet.
**Asupit**: Talk to me like, 11.
**Asupit**: What's the shareholder?
**Fnjie**: So.
**Fnjie**: So apparently somebody you gave Stock to somebody else?
**Asupit**: No.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: All right.
**Fnjie**: Let me look at the trial balance and see what that's about.
**Fnjie**: And then, Fatima, if you don't mind, as I do that, if you can look into the detail behind that.
**Justin**: Yeah, maybe.
**Fnjie**: Appreciate it because we.
**Mcalcetero**: Maybe.
**Fnjie**: Go ahead, Brandon.
**Mcalcetero**: Maybe Brandon took money from the business and instead of making a distribution, it's a receivable.
**Fnjie**: It's.
**Fnjie**: I'm sorry, it's not five minutes.
**Fnjie**: It's 220, 000 random.
**Asupit**: I mean, I didn't give stock to anybody, so, you know, I don't know.
**Asupit**: I mean, I guess it.
**Asupit**: I'm assuming that there's a.
**Asupit**: Is that one transaction?
**Asupit**: Is that several transactions, like what year?
**Asupit**: And I can try to figure out what that is or where it came from, but, you know.
**Asupit**: Yeah, nobody has stuck with me.
**Justin**: It.
**Justin**: It was part of the CPA's adjustments for.
**Justin**: For 2023.
**Asupit**: Oh, okay.
**Mcalcetero**: 2023.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: 12.
**Justin**: 12, 23.
**Fnjie**: Yeah, it's been there since 23.
**Fnjie**: It's exactly.
**Fnjie**: It's 220, 178.
**Fnjie**: 220, 178.
**Fnjie**: Do you have the detail behind that, Fatima, or.
**Justin**: Yeah, I'll send you.
**Mcalcetero**: Did it go out to Brandon?
**Mcalcetero**: Do we know?
**Justin**: No, it.
**Justin**: It didn't say.
**Justin**: It's just a bunch of.
**Justin**: It's a bunch of entries for, you know, retained earnings appreciation, and that seemed to have been the offset account.
**Fnjie**: Interesting, interesting.
**Fnjie**: Okay, so it's a receivable.
**Fnjie**: I don't know what was.
**Fnjie**: So what.
**Fnjie**: The credit side of that was depreciation.
**Justin**: There was accumulated depreciation, retained earnings, distribution, 457k, and then miscellaneous.
**Asupit**: 2023.
**Asupit**: I mean, so the money went out in 2023, you're saying.
**Fnjie**: Oh, there's.
**Fnjie**: There's no money here.
**Fnjie**: Apparently it's just money.
**Fnjie**: Yeah, one side of it was an asset and the other side of it is depreciation and retained earnings.
**Mcalcetero**: We have contact with this 2023 CPA.
**Asupit**: It's the same one?
**Justin**: Yes.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay, can we please send that journal entry and get his understanding of why that went under?
**Mcalcetero**: Shareholder receivable?
**Mcalcetero**: Fatima, they would have been.
**Asupit**: They would have been doing the books then too.
**Asupit**: Cviz was cvs.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Asupit**: Yeah.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay.
**Mcalcetero**: Ayad, we're going to speak to the CPA to understand what happened there and we'll.
**Mcalcetero**: We'll give you guys feedback on that.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay?
**Fnjie**: Yeah, sounds good.
**Fnjie**: I mean, it's there in 23 and 24.
**Fnjie**: Again, if, like Brandon was saying, he didn't issue stock to anybody.
**Fnjie**: Sounds like this is a non cash issue.
**Fnjie**: If I don't, I don't know why he called it shareholder receivable, but you know, to make the expedite things.
**Fnjie**: If this is a, you know, it was a plug account, whatever, he did it wrong.
**Fnjie**: Just expense it.
**Fnjie**: Just take it off the balance sheet.
**Asupit**: Yeah, I mean just code it to whatever's easiest.
**Asupit**: I mean, it, it doesn't matter if it, if it got it called a distribution fine.
**Asupit**: I mean, I don't, I don't really care what my books look like in 23.
**Asupit**: I'm not selling the company right now.
**Fnjie**: Yeah, it's in 23 and 24.
**Fnjie**: So it would, it wouldn't be distribution because you didn't take a distribution for 220k.
**Fnjie**: I, I don't know, Justin.
**Fnjie**: Fatima, you'll look into it, but it sounds like from the get go it should be expensed out.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, Yeah, I, I wanna, I wanna understand what CBIZ did before I, I move anything there.
**Mcalcetero**: If that was a plug account or if they had some sort of reasoning for doing that and then will move it for year end 23A odds so it doesn't even show up in 24 for you.
**Mcalcetero**: So you don't have to exactly worry about it.
**Fnjie**: Exactly.
**Fnjie**: Okay, so shareholder agreement is obviously irrelevant.
**Fnjie**: Should it be recorded in equity?
**Fnjie**: Probably irrelevant as well.
**Fnjie**: Let's see here.
**Fnjie**: Member versus shareholder.
**Fnjie**: Yeah, I mean that's irrelevant.
**Fnjie**: Okay, Operating agreement or, or an articles of incorporation.
**Fnjie**: Well, you're not a corporation, you're llc.
**Fnjie**: So operating agreement.
**Fnjie**: Brandon, if you have like how many units you actually hold, you obviously old 100%.
**Fnjie**: But what's the number of units?
**Asupit**: Yep.
**Asupit**: Go ahead, cinder up.
**Asupit**: Thanks.
**Asupit**: Probably a hundred.
**Asupit**: I mean, I don't have.
**Asupit**: I didn't create an operating agreement because it's just me.
**Asupit**: I just literally went and found.
**Mcalcetero**: How did you set up the entity, Brandon?
**Mcalcetero**: Did you use like legal zoom or something?
**Asupit**: No, I just went online to the government website and start a new business.
**Kjin**: Boom.
**Fnjie**: Boom, Boom.
**Mcalcetero**: I see.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: All right, so there's no.
**Fnjie**: We're just going to say there's no units.
**Fnjie**: We're just going to call it members equity or whatever it comes out to and be done.
**Fnjie**: Okay, go ahead and mark all of those complete, Kevin.
**Fnjie**: Besides the distribution one will leave open and the shareholder receivable.
**Fnjie**: You can go ahead and just say shareholder receivable adjustment pending.
**Mcalcetero**: Fatima, I would just right now in Acumatica make an adjusting entry and move it into a misc expense account on 20 and you're on 20, 23.
**Mcalcetero**: And simultaneously let's reach out to CBIZ and understand what the hell they're doing there.
**Mcalcetero**: But just so we can get this closed out, and 2024 doesn't have that on the balance sheet anymore.
**Justin**: Okay?
**Fnjie**: Yep.
**Fnjie**: So open on distributions, open on the adjustment, and then you can mark complete as everything else.
**Kjin**: Kevin.
**Fnjie**: And then we talked about the whip schedule.
**Fnjie**: Justin, you may.
**Fnjie**: I don't know.
**Fnjie**: Did you catch that part of the conversation?
**Mcalcetero**: Yep.
**Mcalcetero**: Yep.
**Mcalcetero**: Fatima's okay.
**Mcalcetero**: I know Fatima's been working on that, like, yesterday, today, and tomorrow's the latest that we're gonna have that done.
**Mcalcetero**: Right, Fatima?
**Kjin**: Yeah.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah.
**Fnjie**: Kevin, there's not going to be a game fade for this one, so you can just say complete for.
**Fnjie**: For game fade report.
**Fnjie**: Yeah, that's fine.
**Fnjie**: All con contracts just say complete.
**Fnjie**: We got the ones we selected for.
**Fnjie**: We'll obviously let you guys know if we need anything else.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: I mean, the rest is really all in the WIP schedule, so I'm.
**Fnjie**: I'm fine with that.
**Fnjie**: All right, what else we got, Kevin?
**Kjin**: We sent some inquiries about our expense flux to Fatima, but I will.
**Kjin**: Let me see.
**Kjin**: Yeah, those are the ones we discussed.
**Fnjie**: With Brandon the other day, right?
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah.
**Justin**: Can we just look at those right now?
**Justin**: Because I don't think I have the answer to the questions.
**Justin**: I think Brandon already answered most of them.
**Kjin**: Yes, we just have few of those.
**Kjin**: Let's see.
**Fnjie**: You got to click.
**Fnjie**: Click in the Excel, you're.
**Fnjie**: Yeah, Click right there outside of that, number one, and then we'll open.
**Fnjie**: There you go.
**Kjin**: Oh, just one.
**Kjin**: So in 2023, we have zero balance of wage and salary.
**Fnjie**: And then 80k and 24 even.
**Fnjie**: 80k?
**Kjin**: Yeah.
**Kjin**: This is the 24 balance, which is 80k.
**Asupit**: Okay, so what's that mean exactly?
**Mcalcetero**: Who is you?
**Mcalcetero**: 24 for 80k in 23, there wasn't a payment to anyone in that account.
**Mcalcetero**: Do you know who you paid and why you did it in 24 verse 23.
**Fnjie**: So that's.
**Asupit**: So in 24.
**Asupit**: In 23, you're saying wages and salaries.
**Asupit**: We didn't make any pay anybody.
**Asupit**: And then 24, we.
**Asupit**: We did.
**Asupit**: We paid 80,000 in salary in the bonus.
**Mcalcetero**: Sick.
**Mcalcetero**: And this.
**Mcalcetero**: In this specific account, you obviously paid people.
**Asupit**: Oh, yeah.
**Asupit**: In 24, I mean, we just gave $80,000 in bonuses.
**Kjin**: Okay, so this is the bonus.
**Kjin**: Okay?
**Asupit**: Yeah, yeah.
**Asupit**: You're talking about where it says right there, wages, salary and bonus.
**Asupit**: Right?
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Asupit**: That's a bonus.
**Kjin**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: All right.
**Fnjie**: Yeah.
**Fnjie**: Simple explanation.
**Fnjie**: No bonuses in 23.
**Fnjie**: There were bonuses in 24.
**Kjin**: Got it.
**Kjin**: Yeah, I guess that would be all this is the only one question we have for Flux.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: Excellent.
**Fnjie**: Excellent.
**Fnjie**: Is that it, Kevin?
**Fnjie**: Or.
**Kjin**: And then the SOC1 report is still pending.
**Fnjie**: Or.
**Mcalcetero**: Maria.
**Kjin**: I know.
**Asupit**: I saw an email asking for that.
**Asupit**: Didn't they.
**Asupit**: Didn't they send that?
**Asupit**: I thought they sent it back.
**Bclymer**: The report?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Which one?
**Bclymer**: The payroll.
**Bclymer**: You mean Kevin?
**Asupit**: Yeah, the sock one payroll report.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I think.
**Bclymer**: Sorry.
**Bclymer**: I think I sent it to you.
**Bclymer**: Can you double check?
**Kjin**: Oh, let me check.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I send you the.
**Bclymer**: Also the other ones, the lease agreements, everything.
**Bclymer**: So just double check if Don, I can resend that again, too.
**Fnjie**: What I saw, Maria, was an Excel.
**Fnjie**: I don't.
**Fnjie**: I don't think that's what we're looking for.
**Fnjie**: We're actually looking for their.
**Fnjie**: It's called the.
**Fnjie**: It has to say.
**Fnjie**: It's a p.
**Fnjie**: It would come.
**Fnjie**: It would be a PDF, and at the COVID page would say service Organization Controls.
**Fnjie**: So.
**Bclymer**: Oh, that's.
**Bclymer**: That's what it stands.
**Bclymer**: Soc.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Service Organization Control.
**Bclymer**: So let me ask Amanda.
**Bclymer**: She will send it to us.
**Asupit**: Is there maybe like a.
**Asupit**: Hey, here's an example of a sock we could get that way there's no misconception.
**Fnjie**: Yeah, yeah.
**Fnjie**: I mean, I can send you.
**Fnjie**: Kevin, let's send an example.
**Kjin**: Okay.
**Kjin**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Thank you.
**Kjin**: I will send it to Maria after this call.

**Fnjie**: All right, what else we got, Kevin?
**Kjin**: Walk through.
**Kjin**: See, this is the one.
**Kjin**: This one.
**Kjin**: I will take a look.
**Kjin**: What is that?
**Kjin**: Okay.
**Kjin**: Oh, we do requested the.
**Kjin**: One of the invoice for our walkthrough testings for the 155.
**Kjin**: Yeah.
**Kjin**: What is that for five?
**Justin**: There.
**Justin**: There is no invoice.
**Justin**: That is a capital one payment.
**Justin**: And I believe I attached everything.
**Kjin**: Okay.
**Justin**: Yeah, that was a payment made to.
**Justin**: To Capital One credit card.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Justin**: So if you scroll down, you'll see.
**Justin**: Yeah, we.
**Justin**: We just have a snip of like the bank transaction.
**Justin**: That payment.
