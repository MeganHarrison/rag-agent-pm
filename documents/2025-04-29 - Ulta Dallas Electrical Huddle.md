## Transcript
**Brhoades**: Hey, Juan.
**Jescamilla**: Hey, good afternoon, aj.
**Brhoades**: How are you doing?
**Jescamilla**: Oh, another day in paradise.
**Jescamilla**: How are you?
**Speaker 2**: Good.
**Brhoades**: You staying busy?
**Jescamilla**: Yeah, we're hanging in there.
**Jescamilla**: We got a lot of.
**Jescamilla**: It doesn't start until the end of May, June, like everything else does.
**Brhoades**: No.
**Jescamilla**: How are y'all doing?
**Brhoades**: Good, man.
**Brhoades**: We're just, you know, we.
**Brhoades**: Obviously, I have other scopes at Dallas, so we're ripping and roaring there, getting ready to.
**Brhoades**: We're getting ready to hopefully be done here in the next couple months, though.
**Speaker 2**: Okay.
**Brhoades**: What's going on?
**Brhoades**: Brandon?
**Brhoades**: Hey.
**Speaker 3**: What's up, man?
**Brhoades**: Been a while.
**Brhoades**: You doing all right?
**Speaker 3**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: How about you?
**Brhoades**: Can't complain.
**Brhoades**: Second, let me shut my door.
**Brhoades**: Okay.
**Brhoades**: So I know we been waiting to have a conversation, I guess, from your end.
**Brhoades**: What.
**Brhoades**: Where's the gap you're seeing?
**Speaker 3**: If I remember right, we have the demo slash.
**Speaker 3**: I can't remember what they called it, but it's like demo slash, temporary, maybe, but it wasn't like the full D mod lighting scope.
**Speaker 3**: That was.
**Speaker 3**: I think that was like 80 grand or something.
**Speaker 3**: That wasn't included.
**Brhoades**: Yeah.
**Brhoades**: Did someone mention that we were doing the demod lighting to you?
**Speaker 3**: I thought you said we.
**Speaker 3**: We had to do it.
**Brhoades**: No, what I had mentioned is.
**Brhoades**: So I went back and looked at your contract.
**Brhoades**: So we have included.
**Brhoades**: We wrote you a co for it was the.
**Brhoades**: What does this say?
**Brhoades**: Oh, yeah, yeah.
**Brhoades**: So the full trash row lighting.
**Brhoades**: Right.
**Brhoades**: You know what I'm talking about on that?
**Speaker 3**: Yes.
**Speaker 3**: I believe.
**Speaker 3**: I think that was the discrepancy where one set of drawings was different from the other because it had an extra row of lights on every level.
**Speaker 3**: I assume that's the trash row.
**Brhoades**: That's the trash row.
**Brhoades**: Correct.
**Speaker 3**: And we did that though, right, I believe.
**Brhoades**: Yeah.
**Brhoades**: Yeah.
**Brhoades**: From what I've seen now, we still have.
**Brhoades**: We still have the infill of C and D to do.
**Brhoades**: Right.
**Brhoades**: So I.
**Brhoades**: I don't know.
**Brhoades**: What.
**Brhoades**: The drawings aren't the best that you guys made.
**Brhoades**: I know we made them quick.
**Brhoades**: And this would have been Jared Richie, you years ago.
**Brhoades**: Do you.
**Brhoades**: Do I have the most updated set from you, what I'm looking at here?
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, that's.
**Speaker 3**: That's what we have too, man.
**Speaker 3**: Basically, they just took light sources, photometrics, and slapped them on a damn themed title block, which is.
**Speaker 3**: It's a Jared thing to do.
**Speaker 3**: It's like, super cheesy.
**Brhoades**: Yeah.
**Brhoades**: I don't know what the point of the.
**Brhoades**: Of even putting this on here, though.
**Brhoades**: Like, what is this?
**Brhoades**: So they added the photometric.
**Brhoades**: Okay.
**Brhoades**: So.
**Brhoades**: So we.
**Speaker 2**: We.
**Brhoades**: Obviously we have These to do still.
**Brhoades**: Or we got this done, correct, Juan?
**Jescamilla**: Yes, that's correct.
**Jescamilla**: That's the one we did on the what, a couple weeks ago.
**Brhoades**: Yeah.
**Brhoades**: And this one's done, right?
**Jescamilla**: Yeah.
**Jescamilla**: Yes.
**Brhoades**: And this one's done.
**Brhoades**: No, this one's.
**Brhoades**: We still got it.
**Jescamilla**: No, that one's not.
**Jescamilla**: Yeah.
**Brhoades**: And then.
**Brhoades**: Don't need the photo metric.
**Brhoades**: Just looked at those.
**Brhoades**: Okay, so this would be.
**Brhoades**: This is a model, is my understanding.
**Speaker 2**: Okay.
**Brhoades**: Right here.
**Brhoades**: This obviously getting demoed.
**Brhoades**: What's it say?
**Brhoades**: What is this right here?
**Brhoades**: What is this note right here?
**Speaker 3**: Oh, that's a revision.
**Brhoades**: Okay, so I'm going to say we are done, Right?
**Brhoades**: One with this would be A mod.
**Brhoades**: This is the.
**Brhoades**: Or this is B mod.
**Brhoades**: This is the trash row between B and C or whatever.
**Brhoades**: I believe all we have left to do is.
**Brhoades**: Is one and then the trash row on either side and then the other one and C mod.
**Brhoades**: And then we're not doing the lighting in D model.
**Brhoades**: That's not getting reconfigured.
**Jescamilla**: Give me a second.
**Jescamilla**: I'm going to pull Tito's prince real quick.
**Jescamilla**: He highlighted what he has.
**Jescamilla**: Give me a second.
**Speaker 2**: S.A.
**Brhoades**: Brennan, do you guys have an H VAC division in Dallas?
**Brhoades**: That's probably just electricians down there.
**Speaker 3**: I'm not.
**Speaker 3**: I'm not sure.
**Speaker 3**: One would probably be able to answer that.
**Jescamilla**: Sorry, I was looking at the drawer real quick.
**Jescamilla**: We have H Vac guys with our startup.
**Jescamilla**: I mean, our service department has H Vac guys that we do h vac little projects.
**Jescamilla**: RTE change outs.
**Brhoades**: I need two new RTUs at this building.
**Jescamilla**: Yeah, yeah, we could.
**Jescamilla**: We could.
**Jescamilla**: We got drawings for that.
**Jescamilla**: I could pass them along.
**Brhoades**: No drawings.
**Brhoades**: We just need.
**Brhoades**: We're relocating too, and we thought while we relocated, we might as well just get two new ones to replace them because they're old.
**Jescamilla**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jescamilla**: I could have them go get modern serial number if you.
**Jescamilla**: If you like.
**Brhoades**: I already have all that.
**Brhoades**: They have a preferred vendor that they were going through and it was.
**Brhoades**: Their number was astronomical.
**Brhoades**: I was like, well, I can try and get you a better one.
**Brhoades**: So, Brendan, you think I just go call James for that?
**Brhoades**: Or is he buried?
**Speaker 3**: So it'll be different pricing if we use local manpower.
**Speaker 3**: Like if we use Juan's group, it'll save money, I think.
**Brhoades**: All right, Juan, I'll send you all the info.
**Speaker 2**: Okay?
**Jescamilla**: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Jescamilla**: Send it to me and I'll get that going.
**Speaker 2**: Okay.
**Brhoades**: Sweet.
**Brhoades**: So did you.
**Brhoades**: Were you able to see Tito's notes?
**Jescamilla**: He kind of highlighted a bunch of stuff that I'm Trying to double check here real quick.
**Brhoades**: This is kind of flip flopped here.
**Brhoades**: 14 or maybe this is B.
**Brhoades**: So if this is E12 is the bottom right corner.
**Brhoades**: And then I go here, E12.
**Brhoades**: Yeah, I'm looking at the column.
**Brhoades**: The column line.
**Brhoades**: I go, here's 12.
**Brhoades**: Where's E at?
**Brhoades**: Oh, come on.
**Speaker 2**: E 12.
**Brhoades**: Okay, so it is flip.
**Brhoades**: Flip flopped.
**Jescamilla**: Okay, he's in right here.
**Jescamilla**: You all on another floor.
**Brhoades**: It's almost like this.
**Brhoades**: The.
**Brhoades**: On the next pages.
**Brhoades**: It's.
**Brhoades**: It's kind of turned around.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Brhoades**: So this.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, I think we.
**Speaker 3**: I think we noticed that.
**Brhoades**: E12s over here.
**Jescamilla**: But when you look before 12.
**Brhoades**: Say that again.
**Jescamilla**: What about that row of lights?
**Jescamilla**: That's before 12.
**Jescamilla**: Not the trash one, but the next one.
**Jescamilla**: There's nothing.
**Jescamilla**: No, the.
**Jescamilla**: Hold up.
**Speaker 2**: Ah, he.
**Jescamilla**: No, the other side of 12.
**Jescamilla**: The right side right here.
**Jescamilla**: Yeah, that.
**Jescamilla**: Go to the right.
**Jescamilla**: That first roll of lights on the.
**Jescamilla**: Yeah, right there.
**Speaker 2**: Huh.
**Jescamilla**: Those aren't in.
**Jescamilla**: Yeah.
**Brhoades**: Do we have the.
**Brhoades**: Do we have it on either side of the trash row then?
**Jescamilla**: We have it on the left side.
**Jescamilla**: The right side is not.
**Brhoades**: So right here is not complete yet.
**Brhoades**: Correct.
**Brhoades**: So we have two rows to do and that should stop.
**Brhoades**: So.
**Brhoades**: Yeah.
**Brhoades**: Dude, do you mind making some markups and getting these drawings fixed, Brandon?
**Brhoades**: For as built, I also need a panel schedule.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, we're just.
**Speaker 3**: I mean, somebody's gonna have to.
**Speaker 2**: Just.
**Speaker 3**: Send photos of panels and existing.
**Speaker 3**: What's.
**Speaker 3**: What's in there.
**Speaker 3**: Existing, you know, and then mark up what what we've added.
**Brhoades**: That's all.
**Brhoades**: And, And Juan, you can, You'll.
**Brhoades**: You could.
**Brhoades**: You'll be on site so you can get that figured out.
**Brhoades**: I just.
**Brhoades**: These drawings are slapped together and when I do it, I'm have to do an as built and.
**Jescamilla**: Yeah, yeah, I'll go over there and we'll walk the job and make sure we.
**Jescamilla**: We got every role accounted for.
**Jescamilla**: Write the circuits down for every.
**Jescamilla**: Everywhere the circuit changes and jot that down on the drawing and I send it to you guys.
**Brhoades**: Yeah, that works.
**Brhoades**: And then.
**Brhoades**: So that cup.
**Brhoades**: So we did.
**Brhoades**: No, no demod lighting is included.
**Brhoades**: It stops after the infill.
**Brhoades**: Right.
**Brhoades**: So Brendan, we're infilling in between C and D and then we have to put that row of lights down that infill.
**Brhoades**: But then there's nothing on the other side of that we've included.
**Brhoades**: That's your scope.
**Speaker 2**: Okay.
**Speaker 2**: Okay.
**Brhoades**: And I think it says in the contract.
**Brhoades**: So that's what we wrote this change order for.
**Brhoades**: And then we have the change order for the, the pick Mod D temp/ permanent power.
**Brhoades**: So we're going to be ready for that soon.
**Brhoades**: Juan.
**Speaker 2**: Huh?
**Brhoades**: Do you remember what that is?
**Brhoades**: Or Brennan, do you remember what that is?
**Brhoades**: I, I, my understanding is they want that lit up while they're doing.
**Brhoades**: They have to, we obviously have to do the demo and see and all that when they're doing the, the infill like we've done in the past for the pick modules.
**Brhoades**: But they want D to still be lit up.
**Brhoades**: So we have to run new mc, basically temporarily hook it up so the lighting still works.
**Brhoades**: And then when we're back, we'll, we'll, we'll re rehook it permanent.
**Brhoades**: Does that make sense, Juan?
**Jescamilla**: Yeah.
**Jescamilla**: Yeah.
**Jescamilla**: If you want, I could take pictures tomorrow morning if it's okay with you.
**Jescamilla**: Go over there, take pictures so everybody can visually see what's there now.
**Jescamilla**: And then doing temporary is nothing.
**Jescamilla**: We'll run piece of flex and MC cable all the way through and get, get lights burning.
**Brhoades**: Okay.
**Brhoades**: Yeah, that's all, that's all they're looking for.
**Brhoades**: And then I just know that's coming up.
**Brhoades**: I'll have a definite date here when I meet tomorrow in my meeting.
**Brhoades**: I have Candon on site right now.
**Brhoades**: He's one of our supers.
**Brhoades**: He's been there now for two weeks.
**Brhoades**: We're doing welding at night, so he may be there in the morning or not.
**Brhoades**: Juan, he's been working nights though, so just get with me when you're on the way.
**Brhoades**: Can you actually let me know what time and I'll let, I'll let Drew know as well.
**Jescamilla**: Can we do 8 o'clock tomorrow morning?
**Brhoades**: Yeah.
**Brhoades**: That's central time, right?
**Jescamilla**: Yes, sir.
**Jescamilla**: Central time.
**Jescamilla**: And it'll be Mario Munoz that will be there.
**Jescamilla**: I could text you his contact info.
**Brhoades**: Who would it, who will it be?
**Jescamilla**: Mario Munoz.
**Jescamilla**: M U, N O Z.
**Brhoades**: He's gonna show up at 8?
**Jescamilla**: Yes, sir.
**Jescamilla**: He'll be there at 8am in the morning and start taking pictures and putting everything together.
**Brhoades**: Yeah.
**Brhoades**: If I look at my schedule here that I have in Procore.
**Brhoades**: Where did I, I had you guys starting.
**Jescamilla**: 17Th, ain't it?
**Jescamilla**: May 17th, I thought.
**Brhoades**: Yeah, the CND connection demo.
**Brhoades**: So all the demo they need for that starting the seventh is what I have here.
**Speaker 2**: Okay.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Brhoades**: So let me confirm that date and then you'll be doing lights once they make that connection.
**Brhoades**: So you're going to have a little gap there.
**Brhoades**: However, you can hop over and do the dramatic platform lighting that should be complete by the time you're Done with the demo.
**Speaker 2**: Gotcha.
**Brhoades**: And when we do that demo is when we'll do the.
**Brhoades**: I believe that's when that makes sense for us to do that.
**Brhoades**: That temp power at that time.
**Speaker 2**: Okay.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, that's.
**Jescamilla**: That's doable.
**Speaker 3**: Sounds like a plan.
**Brhoades**: You guys got any more questions for me or you?
**Brhoades**: We good?
**Speaker 2**: Foreign?
**Speaker 3**: I'm good.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, I'm good.
**Brhoades**: Sweet.
**Brhoades**: Oh, one thing I wanted to put on your radar, that's not on here, we have to even think about in your scope, is we gotta tie in all the fire alarm for this sprinkler we're putting in.
**Speaker 3**: Oh, boy.
**Brhoades**: What are you oh boying about?
**Brhoades**: You did it in Greenwood.
**Speaker 3**: I know.
**Speaker 3**: Fire alarm just here.
**Speaker 3**: Lately it seems like everything I do with firearms of fiasco.
**Speaker 3**: Juan, you gotta get firearm.
**Brhoades**: What happened down in Columbus, Brennan?
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
**Speaker 3**: It's like every fire alarm system has been a mess lately, and Ulta's pretty stringent.
**Brhoades**: So 1.
**Brhoades**: Are you.
**Brhoades**: Are you comfortable with doing it?
**Jescamilla**: I don't necessarily do it, but I can.
**Jescamilla**: I got a couple subs that I do a lot of.
**Jescamilla**: A lot of sprinkler work and fire alarm work for these industrial warehouse refrigerated warehouses that we do.
**Brhoades**: Juan, did you know that this was in your scope or is this just a reminder to you?
**Jescamilla**: No, I saw.
**Jescamilla**: I saw it on the scope.
**Jescamilla**: I just didn't know to what extent, since I didn't.
**Jescamilla**: I wasn't part of the estimating part of this, because typically on my jobs here in Dallas, I bid.
**Jescamilla**: I bid all the work.
**Jescamilla**: So I kind of know what we're.
**Jescamilla**: I mean, I know what we're getting into, but I only saw the wording on the scope of work.
**Jescamilla**: I didn't know to what full extent that was.
**Brhoades**: So we.
**Brhoades**: We added a couple risers.
**Brhoades**: So we have the pick mod, which.
**Brhoades**: That should already be tied into the fire alarm, that pick module.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Brhoades**: We have the OPEX that we added the dramatic and under the platform.
**Brhoades**: So we just need to.
**Brhoades**: I think the OPEX and the dramatic are the two we really need to get into.
**Brhoades**: But OPEX is the important one, Juan.
**Brhoades**: Okay.
**Speaker 2**: Okay.
**Brhoades**: And you know what the OPEX is?
**Brhoades**: It's that big system that you'll see when you're there.
**Brhoades**: Okay.
**Jescamilla**: Okay, I'll take a look at it.
**Brhoades**: But they should have a module, Right.
**Brhoades**: And you just have to run your wire from that module to the enunciator panel.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Brhoades**: And then, you know, when the fire alarm goes off, the.
**Brhoades**: It shuts the OPEX down.
**Jescamilla**: Yeah, yeah.
**Brhoades**: And you can get with Brennan.
**Brhoades**: Brennan, if you go back and look and get with your guys who did it in Greenwood on what that process looks like.
**Speaker 2**: Okay.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: I think there was a little.
**Speaker 3**: It got a little hairy, though, when we had to tie it in with their control cabinets to shut the system down.
**Speaker 3**: That was a little tricky, if I remember right.
**Speaker 3**: But it.
**Speaker 3**: I mean, it's not a fire alarm guy.
**Speaker 3**: He'll know what to do.
**Brhoades**: All right, well, I.
**Brhoades**: I actually.
**Brhoades**: I want to get on that asap, guys, because they're almost done with the system, and it kind of crept up on me.
**Speaker 2**: Okay.
**Jescamilla**: Yes, sir.
**Brhoades**: That's really important.
**Brhoades**: So they can commission this system here in the next month.
**Speaker 2**: Okay?
**Brhoades**: So I'll be following up with you guys on where we're at with that.
**Brhoades**: I mean, you let me know if you need any more info from opex, okay?
**Brhoades**: And I'll make the connections.
**Speaker 2**: Okay, sounds good.
**Brhoades**: All righty.
**Jescamilla**: All right.
**Brhoades**: See you guys.
**Brhoades**: All right, see you.
**Jescamilla**: All right, bye, guys.
