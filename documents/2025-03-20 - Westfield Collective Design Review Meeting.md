## Transcript
**Bclymer**: Sa.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: Hey, guys, I got.
**Jdawson**: Daniel was able to jump on this week for the first 10 or 15 minutes, so wanted to get him get his part coordinated if there's any questions.
**Jdawson**: Micah email says he was going to be on, so Ashton popping on.
**Jdawson**: Is Tom on here?
**Jdawson**: No.
**Nbigler**: Alex.
**Jdawson**: Morning, Alex.
**Awoodhams**: Morning.
**Jdawson**: Going here.
**Jdawson**: So I sent out the agenda a little bit ago, but we'll get the MEP part done here first, actually, so Daniel can hop off to his other meeting.
**Jdawson**: Currently where we're at, we got Micah got his water plan and schedule sent to Ashton Blue this morning.
**Jdawson**: And so that went to Citizens or that's going to Citizens.
**Jdawson**: Mechanical and plumbing design is currently on hold waiting for the final layout of the kitchen.
**Jdawson**: So Daniel said he'd have that back by the end of the week.
**Jdawson**: And then you can get the following items here.
**Jdawson**: Sized interceptor water and sanitary piping and the gas mechanical for the hoods.
**Jdawson**: Aside from where we're at with the coordination, Daniel, Jeff, Alex, does anybody have anything that each other needs?
**Jdawson**: No, we.
**Gdesmit**: Right when we got those CAD files today, we opened them up.
**Gdesmit**: We're already.
**Gdesmit**: We're working on the layouts for the remaining kitchens right now.
**Gdesmit**: I guess the only question we had for those kitchen pods on the.
**Gdesmit**: On the inside interior of the kitchen, underneath the window there's a green box shown.
**Gdesmit**: Is that.
**Gdesmit**: What is that intended to show there on those.
**Gdesmit**: On those kitchens?
**Ashton**: Yeah.
**Brhoades**: So there's two different things.
**Brhoades**: Right.
**Brhoades**: So there's the counter that's.
**Brhoades**: That's in there, which is the portion.
**Brhoades**: The other box, that is just a clearance box for the overhead portion of the door.
**Brhoades**: So we need the actual housing and everything that is at the head of the rolling concession window.
**Gdesmit**: How high up is that?
**Brhoades**: One second.
**Jdawson**: Is it three and a half feet the same as the exterior ones, Jeff?
**Brhoades**: Yeah, it's similar.
**Brhoades**: The counter Heights are at 210, and then the unit itself is a little taller.
**Brhoades**: Hold on, let me cut a section just so I can get the exact height for the bottom of the.
**Gdesmit**: So the window heights are at.
**Gdesmit**: Are all 88.
**Gdesmit**: They're all at 34 for the windows.
**Brhoades**: Correct.
**Gdesmit**: So anything we can.
**Gdesmit**: We can butt those walls.
**Gdesmit**: We just need to stay underneath 34.
**Gdesmit**: If we need to go to the walls on the inside of the kitchen.
**Brhoades**: Correct.
**Gdesmit**: Okay, cool.
**Brhoades**: Yeah.
**Brhoades**: And so to the bottom of the clearance box that they have is seven foot four.
**Gdesmit**: Okay.
**Brhoades**: Okay.
**Gdesmit**: So the bottom of the clearance box, that's up above 7 foot 4.
**Gdesmit**: All right, cool.
**Bclymer**: Correct.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: There's nothing else.
**Jdawson**: You guys have everything you need?
**Jdawson**: Dan, if you have everything you need.
**Gdesmit**: Yeah, I think we're.
**Gdesmit**: We're gonna try to hammer these out.
**Gdesmit**: We've already got.
**Brhoades**: We.
**Gdesmit**: We already in the last couple days while we were waiting on these.
**Gdesmit**: These kitchen.
**Bclymer**: The.
**Gdesmit**: The changes to the kitchens, we've already got the bars laid out.
**Gdesmit**: Ice cream, wine, coffee.
**Gdesmit**: So we're all ready to go on that.
**Gdesmit**: We're gonna set.
**Gdesmit**: We should be able to send over.
**Gdesmit**: We're going to try to hammer out these kitchens, and I'll send it over as soon as we can.
**Gdesmit**: If we have any questions or concerns Bubbled, we'll.
**Gdesmit**: We'll ask questions.
**Gdesmit**: We, you know, and once we get.
**Gdesmit**: I think we're pretty close to getting the final.
**Gdesmit**: The final done.
**Gdesmit**: So like I said, I'll send those over as fast as we can.
**Gdesmit**: Any questions we have, you know, get answered, and then we should be good to go.
**Jdawson**: So last part of that would just be to reconvene about pricing.
**Jdawson**: At the end of that, go back to the owner with so correct.
**Gdesmit**: All right, so are you.
**Gdesmit**: Is pricing.
**Jdawson**: Who.
**Gdesmit**: Who's.
**Gdesmit**: Is the owner carrying the kitchen equipment themselves?
**Jdawson**: Brandon, you know about.
**Jdawson**: You know an answer to that right now?
**Jfield**: Yeah, they're gonna pay for it.
**Jfield**: They got same.
**Gdesmit**: Okay, so same thing we did in there.
**Brhoades**: Okay, perfect.
**Gdesmit**: Yeah, exactly.
**Jfield**: Yeah, it's exact same operator and everything that you guys did at Liberty.
**Gdesmit**: Yeah, yeah, she's.
**Gdesmit**: Yeah.
**Gdesmit**: So, yeah, Heather was the one that sent me over everything, so should I be quoting pricing directly to her?
**Jfield**: Yeah, I don't care how much it cost.
**Gdesmit**: Okay, cool.
**Jdawson**: Perfect.
**Tom**: That's.
**Gdesmit**: That's.
**Gdesmit**: Love to hear that.
**Gdesmit**: No, I'm just kidding.
**Gdesmit**: That's great.
**Gdesmit**: No, and like I said, as we're.
**Gdesmit**: As we're laying out equipment, we're entering in our quoting software, so they work hand in hand.
**Jfield**: So once I honestly, if it were me, I'd throw a microwave in there and a couple hot Pockets and say done.
**Jfield**: It's Indiana.
**Gdesmit**: Yeah, I hear.
**Gdesmit**: Right.
**Gdesmit**: I hear you go drink some beer and then.
**Gdesmit**: But yeah, so yes, I will add as we do that I'll get pricing together once layouts.
**Gdesmit**: Once layouts are finalized, pricing's quickly behind that, so we should be.
**Gdesmit**: I think we're in pretty good shape now.
**Jdawson**: We got this.
**Gdesmit**: Like I said, we're gonna try to hammer this out today and we'll.
**Gdesmit**: We'll send it over as soon as everything's finished.
**Jdawson**: All right, well, we'll let you get back to it.
**Jdawson**: Daniel, thanks for joining.
**Gdesmit**: Appreciate it, guys.
**Jdawson**: Thanks.
**Jdawson**: All right, we got some movement with permitting this Week kicking off with Ashton civil drawings.
**Jdawson**: We got our APC done on Monday.
**Jdawson**: They had no issues, but they kick back a couple comments that he has already addressed and resubmitted.
**Jdawson**: That was to shift the right of way outside or the milling and resurfacing rather, and then straighten the path and knock those two trees out at the beginning of the property or at the.
**Jdawson**: At the entrance.
**Jdawson**: Right now those have been resubmitted back.
**Jdawson**: Ashton is did or is submitting back to citizens today with the water plan and schedule that they asked for.
**Jdawson**: Last step for.
**Jdawson**: For us, I guess here is kind of get that load information to get to the gas company and then.
**Jdawson**: Ash, we talked about this while I was on site the other day.
**Jdawson**: We're going to have them terminate that existing standpipe or kill it and we'll demo it or.
**Tom**: Yeah, yeah.
**Tom**: I'm not sure who owns that, whether that's their equipment or the.
**Tom**: The old property owner house equipment, but either way.
**Tom**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And then how.
**Jdawson**: How long do you expect them to give us our approval so we can get these CAD files going?
**Jdawson**: The surveyors asked for them a week out, which is about now.
**Jdawson**: What I need them to get started out there.
**Tom**: We could probably let them give it to them now.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Tom**: I mean, I can't imagine what will change, but I've been surprised many times before by them, so I don't know.
**Jdawson**: We talked about that at the beginning and here we are like your fortune.
**Tom**: So.
**Tom**: So, I mean, I don't mind sending it out now just every.
**Tom**: As long as everybody understands they are not fully approved yet.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: This will get them going.
**Jdawson**: If they need to go back and edit something, that's fine.
**Jdawson**: That's what we're doing with the AG peers as well.
**Jdawson**: They're kind of getting it all set up in their shop drawings and then they'll.
**Jdawson**: They'll adjust it with the final cads that come up from Jerrica.
**Jdawson**: All right, you can email me those CAD files in here today.
**Jdawson**: Oh, those guys going Structural Foundation Design.
**Jdawson**: I don't really have anything for this one now.
**Jdawson**: We're waiting on final reactions and Nick's building information for Jericho to complete.
**Jdawson**: But as I just mentioned, CNC is currently working on their shop drawing submittals and they'll make the final edit to that once Jericho releases her final cads.
**Jdawson**: Jerrica, how long do you think you need to review those once.
**Bclymer**: The CNC shops?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: A few days.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: All right, so currently I have them scheduled to begin on April 14, which is the Monday after your 11th date of having your shop draw or having your final drawings, Is there a chance that they can get something from you on the fourth so they can complete their shop drawings and turn it in so you can have that with your approval on the 11th?
**Bclymer**: So we're not getting reactions until the 4th, so I think that that would be very challenging for us to make any real progress.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Jdawson**: So I'm gonna have to push them out at least some time.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: That'll give us some more time on storm site anyways.
**Jdawson**: Stair pans and railing are next.
**Jdawson**: Nick, I think I saw an email from you.
**Jdawson**: Is that what that was?
**Ashton**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: The pricing.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Ashton**: So there's still some questions that you and I, after the meeting, we can go through.
**Ashton**: I guess it'd be.
**Ashton**: Well, a couple of them would be good for Jeff and maybe Jerrica to consider for the handrails.
**Ashton**: As far as the attachment goes, what would you be expecting?
**Ashton**: Are you going to be putting, like, the wood infills, like, on one side, both sides.
**Ashton**: Do you need, like, tabs for those to attach to or do you just want.
**Ashton**: You're expecting just three line rail and that's it, and I walk away.
**Ashton**: You guys and the wood person are going to figure out how that's going to come together.
**Brhoades**: Yeah.
**Brhoades**: So for the exterior ones, we wouldn't want to do it on just one side.
**Brhoades**: I think we'd want to.
**Brhoades**: Sandwich would depend on if we want.
**Bclymer**: Excuse me.
**Brhoades**: It might be easier with a tab just because you wouldn't have to widen the main rail.
**Brhoades**: Why don't I send you over a sketch after this and we can talk about what you think is most cost effective if we widen the actual post or if we add a tab to attach things to.
**Ashton**: Okay, that's fair.
**Brhoades**: And then I'm assuming for the actual stairs itself, what we're calling out in our drawings, just for all the exterior steel to be painted and then the actual treads themselves just be a concrete fill with a exterior broomfish.
**Ashton**: Yeah.
**Ashton**: So would you want everything to be primed for me or do you want, like powder coated black, which is what I currently have in my price?
**Brhoades**: It would depend on how.
**Brhoades**: Brandon, you guys are quoting this extra steel from Parker Pruden to come.
**Brhoades**: If it's all going to be primed and just painted with.
**Brhoades**: With an exterior paint, then I would prefer that you do the same thing with the stair, just so they can come and do it all at the same time.
**Brhoades**: Because it's going to be a.
**Brhoades**: You know, it's It's a custom color.
**Brhoades**: Right.
**Brhoades**: So it'd be.
**Brhoades**: I think it'd be easier for them to just paint everything all at once.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Ashton**: Yeah.
**Ashton**: I mean that makes sense to me because.
**Ashton**: Yeah.
**Ashton**: VP steel is going to come out primed, correct?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Brhoades**: So I think it'd be easier for them to just paint everything that is going to be visible.
**Brhoades**: It comes out primed, it gets painted and then they call it a day.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jfield**: That way.
**Ashton**: Including all the handrails too?
**Brhoades**: Including.
**Brhoades**: Yeah, yeah, I would say the same thing.
**Brhoades**: Including all, all the handrails.
**Brhoades**: Yep.
**Brhoades**: I mean, Brandon, same thing for the interior, right?
**Brhoades**: I mean, everything's going to come primed.
**Brhoades**: They're gonna paint all of the mezzanine steel, the railing steel, the.
**Jfield**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jfield**: Everything will be, everything will be painted that way.
**Jfield**: You know, if it comes pre painted, it inherently is going to get chipped and then it's.
**Jfield**: We're patching it and it doesn't look as good.
**Jfield**: So.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Ashton**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Architectural designs.
**Jdawson**: Next we got insulation with the white liner.
**Jdawson**: So Nick responded that the paint would eliminate the fire rating or fire spread on that white liner.
**Jdawson**: If we did murals and spray paint.
**Jfield**: It'S just to be clear, it's.
**Jfield**: You're saying that it would eliminate the flame spread, right, because that thing's not rated.
**Ashton**: Well, yeah.
**Ashton**: I mean, basically, I think I've submitted all the, all the information on the insulation to you guys as far as like, hey, this is what the product looks like and this is what the fire rating is and what.
**Ashton**: And what it does.
**Ashton**: Well, if you still need to have.
**Jfield**: That cut sheet because Nick, I've never seen and it doesn't mean it doesn't exist, but an actual ul fire rated insulation.
**Jfield**: Now there's flame spread rating, but fire rating meaning that this is a one hour rated insulation.
**Jfield**: I've never seen.
**Jfield**: Not saying it wouldn't be.
**Ashton**: I.
**Ashton**: I don't know what the fire rating is or the, you know, the fire retardant factor is that comes on the facing.
**Ashton**: But I guess what they're saying is, yeah, this is kind of the default product.
**Ashton**: I can get you that specification stuff.
**Jfield**: Yeah.
**Jfield**: Glenn, get the, get the product data sheet.
**Jfield**: I'm fairly certain that what they're saying is that if we apply something then it's going to.
**Jfield**: To.
**Jfield**: They can't guarantee the flame spread rating is the same because that thing is not a radio assembly.
**Ashton**: Right.
**Brhoades**: Yeah, I would agree, Brandon.
**Brhoades**: Yeah.
**Brhoades**: If you painted it would.
**Brhoades**: It would not no longer carry a class A fire rating, which.
**Jfield**: It's an exterior wall.
**Jfield**: It doesn't really matter.
**Jfield**: And behind it is metal.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Jdawson**: So light source gave us a rough order magnitude on doing the LED lights and stuff this week.
**Jdawson**: Got that over to Dean and Brennan and Brendan.
**Jdawson**: Are you on for Alex?
**Jdawson**: I don't think Brennan is.
**Brhoades**: I'm here.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So we talked about having.
**Jdawson**: Having light sources break it out a little bit.
**Jdawson**: You know, you know, the strip lighting per bar and then the LED lighting in the volleyball courts.
**Jdawson**: Just a lump sum price isn't going to help us out with determining what they want to do.
**Jdawson**: He said he was going to speak with Andrew about that.
**Jdawson**: I just want to follow up and see.
**Jdawson**: I don't know if he had.
**Jdawson**: I was going to ask him on this meeting.
**Jdawson**: I was the one who asked.
**Jdawson**: Was her name Mandy for this and for this stuff in the beginning?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, they.
**Jdawson**: They should be able to accommodate.
**Jdawson**: They're very good about that.
**Bclymer**: Good.
**Jdawson**: We already discussed this with the kitchen.
**Jdawson**: Jeff, the renderings.
**Jdawson**: We'd like to have some of these and emailed you yesterday.
**Jdawson**: Is there any costs associated with that, or are these part of your models already?
**Brhoades**: Well, I guess Brand and Glenn, it would depend on what you guys want.
**Brhoades**: If you want just the similar ones with no context or anything that were sent before, we can do those directly from the model.
**Brhoades**: But if you want site context or anything else added, we'll have to model all.
**Brhoades**: All of that.
**Jdawson**: This is kind of the rendering we have.
**Jdawson**: So, like an updated version of a couple.
**Brhoades**: Yeah, it'd be an updated version of that with, you know, the materials updated and a few colors changed based on what we've fixed and updated.
**Brhoades**: But anything beyond that, we'd have to do some additional modeling.
**Bclymer**: That's.
**Brhoades**: That's not in the Revit model.
**Brhoades**: We'd have to model the site and add, you know, we can add trees and people on cars and all that stuff, but that's not in the Revit model.
**Brhoades**: We'd have to do that in a separate group.
**Jfield**: Get a price and timeline, and I'll talk to the owner.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Last one or no, two more on this one.
**Jdawson**: Update finishes to continue bidding.
**Jdawson**: Do we have a date maybe that we can get similar to those renderings, some updated interior information or renderings, elevation shots of the interior that we could pass down to the guys so they can continue bidding.
**Jdawson**: You know, we know the locations of the tile walls and the wet walls and stuff like that, but any of the other kind of finishes that we can get them so they can.
**Jdawson**: Finalists out there bidding, Some wall types, anything like that?
**Brhoades**: Yeah, we're working through finish Plans now getting paint notes and everything on there.
**Brhoades**: From an interior elevation standpoint, I mean, I, I don't know if we'll have anything finalized before the 44 date.
**Brhoades**: I mean, that's, that's what we're working for, working toward to have our final drawings done.
**Jdawson**: I'm gonna ask you every week until you give me a better answer.
**Brhoades**: I mean, I.
**Brhoades**: It's.
**Brhoades**: It's just really tough to send stuff piecemeal.
**Brhoades**: Right.
**Brhoades**: Like, I know one thing at a time.
**Jdawson**: So, yeah, I'm.
**Jdawson**: And as the design develops, I keep.
**Jdawson**: I kind of keep the interior guys updated.
**Jdawson**: Many of them can just do several of these trades at once.
**Jdawson**: The acoustic ceilings, the drywall, the frame and insulation.
**Jdawson**: A lot of these.
**Jdawson**: A lot of these things kind of are all in one package.
**Jdawson**: So I'll ask you again next Thursday.
**Jdawson**: I'm just kidding.
**Jdawson**: The matte black finish on the overhead doors.
**Jdawson**: I know we asked for the black anodized, but I had one of the.
**Jdawson**: One of the companies asked.
**Jdawson**: They don't carry the black anodized.
**Jdawson**: They do a matte black finishes more sturdy and lasts a little bit longer.
**Jdawson**: Is that something we consider or just tell them no on submitting that.
**Jdawson**: I told them to submit a product, you know, product sheet with their.
**Jdawson**: With their bid to me so I could send it to you, but I just want to know if that was even going to be considered.
**Brhoades**: I guess that's up to Brandon on your guys side.
**Brhoades**: I mean, we would prefer probably all of the doors and windows to match from a finish standpoint on the exterior anodized is going to be.
**Brhoades**: It's going to hold up better than a painted finish, especially on an overhead door that isn't, you know, just like a solid slab, like a hollow core metal door that you could paint.
**Brhoades**: I'm fine either way, but I'll leave that up to Lynn.
**Jfield**: What was the question you said you wanted to do?
**Jdawson**: One of the.
**Jdawson**: One of the overhead door subcontractors has a matte black finish instead of a black anodized.
**Jdawson**: But the direction I've given everybody else is the black anode windows and overhead doors, which are not the same person.
**Jdawson**: To Jeff's point, it would not.
**Jfield**: I don't know what I've never done a matte black aluminum opening.
**Jfield**: I, I don't even know what that means.
**Jfield**: That's painted.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I think he said it was coated.
**Jfield**: Powder coated.
**Jdawson**: Maybe.
**Jfield**: I, I would, I would have to see a cut sheet.
**Jfield**: But my, My thoughts are initially.
**Jfield**: Or.
**Jfield**: Or no, it should all be like.
**Jfield**: I don't know again, I don't know what that metal would be like.
**Jfield**: It doesn't make sense to me to have that.
**Jfield**: So we'll look at that.
**Jfield**: But no, it should, I would think.
**Jfield**: What's that say?
**Jfield**: Oh, David, David Biddle.
**Jfield**: You do not black anodized, but we can matte black powder coat.
**Jfield**: Pick one pen.
**Jfield**: I don't tell them to send some pictures in a data sheet and I'll look at it.
**Jfield**: And yeah, see, like, I don't know if there's a price difference, but I mean, there's also, I mean, I don't know if you've just got with David, but you can get with, you know, garage door Indy.
**Jfield**: There's Mike Long over at freaking whatchamacallit.
**Jfield**: You know, there's a few different ones that, that we can get numbers on.
**Jfield**: So I mean, it's.
**Jfield**: It should be able to find this and the glass guys sometimes will do that.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, he's, he's just the last bit I'm waiting on before I do before I buy this out.
**Jdawson**: And that was his question.
**Gdesmit**: So.
**Jfield**: Yeah, I've never, I've never done that.
**Jfield**: So I don't know.
**Jfield**: Have you ever done that, Jeff?
**Brhoades**: I mean, we've had.
**Brhoades**: Depending on the type of door.
**Brhoades**: I don't know if I've ever specked a full light door that wasn't anodized aluminum.
**Jfield**: Yeah, these are for the.
**Jfield**: Yeah, I, I, these are for the overhead doors, not the man doors.
**Jfield**: Correct.
**Bclymer**: Correct.
**Jfield**: Yeah, I don't know.
**Jfield**: I've never, I've never done it.
**Jfield**: So we can get some cut sheets and look at it, but I'm leaning towards no.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Gas and electric loads.
**Jdawson**: Really the only thing on here is deem.
**Jdawson**: I think you could.
**Jdawson**: Did one of you guys meet out there with Duke last week for the transformer?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I met John Schultz with Duke and he sent over some requests for things that he needs us to send to him.
**Jdawson**: So I'm working on that.
**Ashton**: And yeah, we're moving forward.
**Jdawson**: Once Mike has the info from the above, you can provide the gas loads to Ashton and we can finish out the stuff with the gas company.
**Jdawson**: All right, here's our design deliverables.
**Jdawson**: Is anything.
**Jdawson**: Do all these dates still align with all of you?
**Jdawson**: I didn't hear anything about getting anything pushed out.
**Jdawson**: So this is where we're at.
**Jdawson**: And I don't have anything else for today.
**Brhoades**: Yeah, I have something for Nick and the team if we have a second.
**Brhoades**: All right, so going through.
**Brhoades**: Nick, sorry for the fire drill.
**Brhoades**: There was some weird work set stuff in there.
**Brhoades**: But I think we got most of it taken care of.
**Brhoades**: Right.
**Brhoades**: I think the one thing that's outstanding, and if you.
**Brhoades**: You were on the DWG base files that got sent earlier this morning, Were you on that or.
**Brhoades**: No?
**Brhoades**: If not, I'll forward them to you.
**Brhoades**: There was like 15 people on the list, so I just kind of assumed you were.
**Brhoades**: Okay, I'll get them over to you.
**Brhoades**: The only thing that changed was we moved.
**Jfield**: I just adjusted.
**Brhoades**: Okay.
**Brhoades**: We had to adjust the vertical chase opening that's near the storage in commissary.
**Brhoades**: We.
**Brhoades**: Based on where we believe the mezzanine steel framing is going to be a portion of that chase was essentially stand like fitting over the W shapes.
**Brhoades**: So we scooted it over and assumed essentially a 12 inch top flange.
**Brhoades**: That may have to get adjusted more when we get the final.
**Brhoades**: When we get the final mezzanine drawings.
**Brhoades**: Right.
**Brhoades**: But I want to make sure that you guys are looking at those two vertical chase openings from a.
**Brhoades**: As a standpoint.
**Ashton**: So what always changed the 2 foot 4 and 58 inch dimension.
**Brhoades**: So the, the.
**Brhoades**: Let me see what we have over here.
**Brhoades**: Not that one.
**Brhoades**: That one stayed the same.
**Brhoades**: The one that's near the storage commissary up on the north side, that one stayed exactly the same.
**Brhoades**: The one that's on the screen now.
**Brhoades**: The one up on the north side of the building.
**Brhoades**: So that one, the size is the same on the second floor, but it shifted to the west to clear that column line.
**Brhoades**: Because I'm assuming that there's going to be a W shape that goes north to south.
**Brhoades**: Okay, I got you at that, at that Chase.
**Brhoades**: The one that's up by the bathroom.
**Brhoades**: Glenn, if you're the one controlling, it's that 6 foot 4 by 1 foot 10.
**Brhoades**: So there's.
**Ashton**: So there's an opening in the mezzanine that I need to add right there.
**Brhoades**: Correct.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Brhoades**: The only other thing that was still out.
**Ashton**: Those are the dimensions.
**Ashton**: 1 foot 10 by 6 foot 4.
**Ashton**: That's all you need?
**Ashton**: There's no more like, oh, clearance needs to be added on any direction or anything?
**Brhoades**: Nope, that's.
**Brhoades**: That's the clear size that, that we need for it.
**Ashton**: Okay, how far is that, like from.
**Ashton**: Let's see.
**Jdawson**: Jeff, you said you're moving this whole wall west to get off to get this chase out of the column line though.
**Brhoades**: Correct.
**Brhoades**: So roughly, those clear dimensions are roughly 6 inches Nick off of the center line of those columns.
**Brhoades**: We're trying to assume it.
**Brhoades**: We're assuming a 12 inch flange, but if BP comes back and says, no, the one that goes north and south is 14 inches and not 12 inches.
**Brhoades**: Well, then I'll have to scoot over another two.
**Ashton**: Okay, but where, like, what's the critical dimension?
**Ashton**: Like, if you look at that line between the two buildings, the volleyball and dining building.
**Ashton**: Yeah.
**Ashton**: Like, where do you want the framed opening to start going?
**Ashton**: Like, right to left.
**Ashton**: Yeah.
**Ashton**: Like from line nine to the top corner of that.
**Ashton**: Because that's what we'll care about.
**Ashton**: You know what I mean, when we lay it out.
**Brhoades**: Wait, say that again.
**Brhoades**: So you're talking about.
**Brhoades**: Are we talking about column line nine?
**Ashton**: Yeah.
**Ashton**: Yeah.
**Ashton**: So in column line nine, you know, where does that opening start going east to west.
**Ashton**: Like 23ft to the left starts the corner.
**Brhoades**: It's a little under 20ft.
**Brhoades**: It's like 19 8.
**Ashton**: But yeah, if you guys could afford me those drawings, that'd be great.
**Ashton**: But I think that's probably all I need.
**Ashton**: And I understand that the flange dimensions can alter that slightly.
**Brhoades**: Yeah.
**Brhoades**: Because the goal is to not have to only have two pieces of additional steel to box it out.
**Brhoades**: Right.
**Brhoades**: We would use the, the, the W shapes that run along.
**Brhoades**: Along 10 and K to right to be the other two edges.
**Ashton**: That makes sense.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Brhoades**: Let'S see.
**Brhoades**: And then besides that, the, the only other thing that was outstanding, they still had some girts that were not in the wall cavity along 14.
**Brhoades**: I just assumed it was just a.
**Brhoades**: An oversight.
**Brhoades**: It was like 50% of the girts were in the wall in the right spot.
**Brhoades**: The other ones weren't.
**Brhoades**: So I moved them in.
**Brhoades**: I edited our IFC revit conversion and just moved them back in the wall so they're in line.
**Brhoades**: And then the steel corner that they have, the steel corner pieces that they have for the mezzanine, they only have the Florida ceiling ones right now along J, not along B.
**Brhoades**: So we're.
**Brhoades**: I think we're still assuming that the ones along B still go all the way to the top and the ones along F and D do not.
**Brhoades**: Right.
**Brhoades**: So that's why those would not have been shown currently, because they don't go top to bottom.
**Ashton**: Okay, so correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought we talked about this and we decided on no full height columns on line B at that at those corners for viewing purposes for when you walk into the building.
**Ashton**: And I thought Brandon maybe weighed in on that comment.
**Ashton**: Am I misremembering that or correct?
**Jfield**: Yeah, those.
**Jfield**: The only full height ones were the other ones on the other end on J.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Ashton**: Yeah, so that's.
**Brhoades**: I misspoke.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Brhoades**: So we're still showing in our model, just as a point of reference right now.
**Brhoades**: We're still showing our columns at FD&P.
**Brhoades**: Just so they're visually, we can call them out, even though we don't have them from VP yet, I think.
**Ashton**: Yep.
**Brhoades**: Our mezzanine opening right now is essentially just a placeholder until we get the mezzanine steel finalized.
**Brhoades**: Right.
**Brhoades**: This.
**Brhoades**: The edge will be wherever those W flanges are.
**Brhoades**: So it just is what it is right now, and we'll adjust accordingly.
**Brhoades**: I think, Brandon, based on the conversations I've had with Nick, you probably won't see a mezzanine plan until, I mean, maybe even after the fourth at this point.
**Brhoades**: Nick.
**Ashton**: Yeah, I think that's safe to say.
**Ashton**: Yeah.
**Brhoades**: Okay.
**Brhoades**: So what we're going to do is we're going to have generic sections for those.
**Brhoades**: It's nothing that'll, you know, like, we can submit it to state.
**Brhoades**: That's not something that.
**Brhoades**: That they're going to fall on over.
**Brhoades**: But once we get the drawings from BP for the mezzanine, we're gonna have to go back and adjust basically everything that the mezzanine touches from a section standpoint to make final, like, four construction drawings.
**Brhoades**: So there'll be a state set that will go out, and then we'll have to issue a second set that will most likely also include updates from Jerika from a foundation standpoint.
**Brhoades**: Yeah.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah.
**Jfield**: I mean, basically like a detailed construction set.
**Jfield**: That's fine.
**Jfield**: You know, we'll make, you know, we just.
**Jfield**: Yeah, we have to make sure that we are.
**Jfield**: We'll upload that and distribute that to the subs.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Brhoades**: I just wanted to make sure that.
**Brhoades**: That, that was out there so no one was saying, hey, well, these.
**Brhoades**: These sections aren't, you know, exactly what we need when we send the state permits that.
**Brhoades**: Because we'll need a little time to do coordination once we get the final messing diagrams from bb, so.
**Brhoades**: And that's.
**Brhoades**: That's all I had.
**Nbigler**: Hey, this is Jesse.
**Nbigler**: Did you.
**Nbigler**: Nick, do you have all the exhaust fan openings or is that something that they'll detail on site?
**Nbigler**: The kitchen exhaust at the roof?
**Ashton**: Yeah, I've just been told that I'm doing a bunch of boots.
**Ashton**: No roof curbs outside of the four curbs that we've already located.
**Gdesmit**: And.
**Brhoades**: Yeah.
**Ashton**: Are they gonna be bigger than, like, what.
**Ashton**: What size are we talking.
**Nbigler**: It'll be small, like 2 foot by 2 foot max, I would think.
**Nbigler**: But there's just a grease duct, a grease hood that'll sit over a cur.
**Nbigler**: You know, I guess if you're making a curb, then we just need to getting that info from the kitchen guy.
**Ashton**: Yeah, I mean, we need to know two foot by two foot will require another roof curb.
**Ashton**: Okay, now, do I need the locations?
**Ashton**: No, but I need to know the dimensions, all that good stuff because I got to get those ordered.
**Nbigler**: Okay.
**Ashton**: In price to you guys.
**Nbigler**: So, Glenn, get that.
**Nbigler**: The kitchen guy should have that standard info.
**Ashton**: Is it just one or is it multiple?
**Jdawson**: It'll be probably goods.
**Nbigler**: One pre showed there's five restaurants, five hoods.
**Jdawson**: I'll send you in.
**Jdawson**: I'll send you in.
**Jdawson**: Daniel, an email here right now.
**Nbigler**: Nick.
**Jdawson**: All right, guys.
**Jdawson**: Anybody else?
**Jdawson**: Jerrica, you didn't have much to say today.
**Bclymer**: We're just waiting, so.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Not a lot to add.
**Jdawson**: All right, guys, that's it.
**Jdawson**: Thank you.
**Ashton**: Thanks.
**Bclymer**: Sa.
