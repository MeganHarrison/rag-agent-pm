## Transcript
**Bclymer**: Suspect war.
**Fnjie**: Hi, guys.
**Justin**: Hey.
**Bclymer**: Hello.
**Fnjie**: So just so you know, Brand.
**Fnjie**: So, yeah, Brando won't be able to connect today because he's in Florida traveling right now doing something with a.
**Fnjie**: Another project that he has.
**Fnjie**: He has some questions, but I'm gonna let them to, you know, after the meeting if you want or if you.
**Fnjie**: Right now.
**Fnjie**: That's okay.
**Asupit**: Either way works.
**Fnjie**: But he wants to know.
**Fnjie**: One second, please.
**Fnjie**: I'm on his chat.
**Fnjie**: Let me try to find this.
**Fnjie**: He.
**Fnjie**: Can you find out when the audio will be done and I mean, if there's a way to get it sooner, he wants to reach by May, by May 2, but that's up to you.
**Asupit**: Yeah, we're still on track to finish by mid May.
**Asupit**: Okay.
**Asupit**: Mark marking the or targeting the 14th, but we're trying to push for the 9th.
**Fnjie**: Okay, perfect.
**Asupit**: We kind of needed him on this call to go through a few things, but is it.
**Asupit**: I'll probably just call him later then.
**Fnjie**: Yeah, if you want to call him or let me know then I'll try to nudge him because I know he's.
**Fnjie**: If you.
**Fnjie**: Whatever works for you, if you want to call him, that's fine.
**Fnjie**: And also I will nudge him to reply to this.
**Asupit**: Okay.
**Asupit**: What other questions does he have?
**Fnjie**: No, only I want.
**Fnjie**: He wants to move forward.
**Fnjie**: That's it.
**Fnjie**: Like faster.
**Asupit**: Of course.
**Asupit**: We are pushing as much as we can.
**Asupit**: No worries.
**Asupit**: No worries.
**Asupit**: All right.
**Asupit**: Hi, Fatima.
**Asupit**: Hi, Justin.
**Bclymer**: Hello.
**Asupit**: Hello.
**Asupit**: Hello.
**Asupit**: All right, so let's.
**Asupit**: So we're doing these bi weekly calls in order to get this done as soon as possible.
**Asupit**: We'll go through the open items list, high level.
**Asupit**: And then we want to dive into the whip schedule.
**Asupit**: And then.
**Asupit**: Well, we were going to do a walkthrough with Brandon, but Brandon's not available.
**Asupit**: Maria, is he gonna be available later today or.
**Fnjie**: Yes, you can call him today or tomorrow.
**Fnjie**: He will be the day that he's back.
**Fnjie**: But if you want to call him today, that's fine.
**Fnjie**: I will say afternoon is good.
**Asupit**: Okay.
**Asupit**: So Adrian and Kevin, maybe let's try to give Brandon a call after you guys come back from lunch.
**Asupit**: It'll be maybe Eastern Time, 4pm so around 1pm Our time.
**Asupit**: Let's try to get.
**Fnjie**: Yes, that's good.
**Justin**: And me and Fatima can be on that as well.
**Asupit**: Sure.
**Justin**: Just to chat through it with Brandon and so he knows we're all on the same page.
**Asupit**: Absolutely, absolutely.
**Asupit**: Okay, then in that case we'll have to set up an invite.
**Justin**: So.
**Asupit**: And which is even better.
**Asupit**: So Maria, can we send an invite for 4:00pm Eastern.
**Fnjie**: Yes.
**Fnjie**: Yeah, I'll make sure brother attends that one.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Asupit**: Okay, perfect.
**Asupit**: Let me just check everybody's schedule and then we'll.
**Asupit**: We'll send another invite.
**Asupit**: All right, so let's go through the open items.
**Asupit**: Kevin, I think you're going to be sharing the smartsheet.
**Kjin**: Yes.
**Asupit**: So we'll talk about WIP at the end.
**Asupit**: Let's go through some of the other ones.
**Kjin**: Yeah.
**Kjin**: So for now the biggest thing we are still open is updated WIP schedules.
**Kjin**: And then the second one, this is the walkthrough supporting documents for the disbursement walkthroughs.
**Kjin**: That one we just want to know.
**Kjin**: We're going to select the samples and then we will request the payment for payment proof for that specific particular invoice and that.
**Kjin**: That's it.
**Kjin**: And then after we go through the work to do with the Brandon this afternoon, we probably will want more samples coming up for the rev for the walk to do of the revenue and then the expense flux inquiries.
**Kjin**: Let's see.
**Kjin**: I guess this one is already uploaded to our smartsheet, which is by TB accounts level.
**Kjin**: Please respond through the smartsheet because I just got this open items from the graph.
**Kjin**: So I didn't know where we uploaded to the smartsheet, but I will let you know Fatima and Justin after this call where we uploaded this.
**Asupit**: So Fatima and Justin are probably not going to know.
**Asupit**: So that's another Brandon question.
**Kjin**: Yeah.
**Asupit**: Why?
**Asupit**: This is why expense.
**Asupit**: Why certain expenses went up or down in 24 compared to 23 Justin or Fatima.
**Asupit**: I'm assuming you guys probably don't have that insight.
**Bclymer**: No, we don't.
**Bclymer**: But I.
**Bclymer**: I thought I saw Brandon's email responding to that.
**Asupit**: Yeah, you responded to the whole financial statement, balance sheet and P L fluctuation.
**Asupit**: But we're doing specific expenses.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Asupit**: Yep.
**Asupit**: All right, Kevin, what else?
**Kjin**: Yeah, and then the cash.
**Kjin**: What I heard is we are missing cash reconciliations for a bank reconciliations for 2023 year end.
**Kjin**: We do have the RIC bank recon which is for which is the reconciliation for year end 2024, December 31st.
**Kjin**: But we don't have the bank recon.
**Kjin**: The one we received is not.
**Kjin**: The bank reconciled on the date of December 31st.
**Kjin**: So we need the reconciliation workpaper that is for the year end 2023 as well for us to make further selections.
**Bclymer**: Are you sure?
**Bclymer**: I uploaded that.
**Mcalcetero**: Check?
**Kjin**: Fatima, can you guide me where you.
**Bclymer**: Uploaded to this to lie?
**Bclymer**: It's in the attachments on item 2323.
**Kjin**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: So what happened with that was whoever reconciled the account at the time.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, they reconciled it as of December.
**Bclymer**: January 5th.
**Kjin**: January 5th.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, the reconciliation dates says January 5th, but the items were reconciled at, you know, as of December 31st, and they tie out to the December 31st statement balance.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so it's just a reconciliation date that says January 5th.
**Kjin**: Okay.
**Kjin**: Yep.
**Kjin**: We can take a look and then make further selections from that.
**Kjin**: Okay, and then.
**Kjin**: So suck one report we discussed.
**Kjin**: Fatima, we discussed this yesterday.
**Kjin**: If you are able to pull out from.
**Asupit**: Gonna reach out to Brandon for that one, Kevin.
**Asupit**: So Maria, you're on the call still, right?
**Fnjie**: Yes, I'm here.
**Asupit**: Is there.
**Asupit**: Do you have contact with the payroll provider that was around?
**Fnjie**: Yes, they do.
**Fnjie**: So we.
**Fnjie**: Yeah.
**Fnjie**: So this is 2024, correct?
**Asupit**: Yes.
**Fnjie**: Yeah.
**Fnjie**: So we were actually working on it because we switched from our payroll provider starting this year.
**Fnjie**: So we are reaching out the previous one.
**Fnjie**: And I know that Brandon has to go.
**Fnjie**: I wanted to go by myself, but I can do it because he needs to verify the account.
**Fnjie**: So that's something that you need very urgently.
**Fnjie**: And we have it on the list.
**Fnjie**: So the payroll for 2024, we do have it pending.
**Asupit**: Okay.
**Asupit**: And then did we.
**Asupit**: Did we look into getting the Pro Pro Core Soc report as well?
**Fnjie**: I think they did.
**Fnjie**: I think Brandon did, but I have to confirm with him.
**Fnjie**: I'll keep you posted.
**Asupit**: Okay, thank you.
**Kjin**: Yes.
**Kjin**: And then we will send.
**Kjin**: After this call, we will send over the inquiries about our J testings and then the payroll reconciliations.
**Kjin**: We.
**Kjin**: We.
**Kjin**: We done with the payroll reconciliations, but just couple questions arise from our analytics and then.
**Kjin**: Yes, those are all the open items for now.
**Asupit**: Okay, excellent.
**Asupit**: All right, so the big one we want to talk about is wip, right?
**Kjin**: Yes.
**Asupit**: All right, Fatima, I know this is going to have to involve Brandon a little bit, but did you discuss with Brandon and.
**Asupit**: Or Justin what we talked about yesterday?
**Bclymer**: I discussed with.
**Bclymer**: With Justin, not Brandon yet.
**Asupit**: Yeah.
**Asupit**: All right, so open up the WIP schedule, Kevin.
**Asupit**: So high level Brandon, we're.
**Asupit**: I'm sorry, Justin.
**Asupit**: We're looking at the 2024 whip and obviously Brandon didn't want to go back and do a 23 WIP, which is.
**Asupit**: Okay.
**Asupit**: And I'll clarify what we needed there in a second.
**Asupit**: But you know, cost and how we incur cost is obviously what drives also our revenue.
**Asupit**: As we incur 10 of the cost, that's a good indication that we should be recognizing 10% of the revenue.
**Asupit**: And so right now we're out of.
**Asupit**: We're out of sync.
**Asupit**: If you look at Just Ulta Dallas as a good example, or row 33 and 34, where we have a lot of cost in last year, but not a lot of revenue.
**Asupit**: And then this year we're at 861,000 in revenue, but the cost is super small, causing a 94% gross profit.
**Asupit**: And so we're expecting as the jobs progress, that the cost is updated and the margin is within a reasonable range of what it was initially budgeted at.
**Asupit**: Right.
**Asupit**: And so, you know, looking at core Mark and Siva, we recognized all the revenue last year, but there was still stuff to do in 2024.
**Asupit**: So that tells me that some of the revenue should be recognized in 2024, if these numbers are right.
**Asupit**: And so when looking at column AI, that's really.
**Asupit**: I don't know, I have to ask Brandon what his target profit margin is, but apparently there was a.
**Asupit**: A notion that we didn't want to touch 2023, so because of tax reasons.
**Asupit**: But ultimately we got to get.
**Asupit**: If we got to.
**Asupit**: If we're going to get 24.
**Asupit**: Right.
**Asupit**: We potentially have to book adjustments in 23.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Justin**: And.
**Justin**: And so my only question is, what stops us then when have to making adjustments in 22 as well?
**Justin**: Like, how far back would we have to go knowing that this practice could have potentially spent in prior years for a while?
**Justin**: Like, that's what I'm worried about.
**Justin**: And I'm sure.
**Justin**: I'm sure Brandon would obviously not be too ecstatic about having to go back to 2023 as well.
**Justin**: Again, assuming this is right, which we would have to talk to Brandon.
**Justin**: But yeah, I guess my question is, like, what.
**Justin**: Where do we draw the line here?
**Asupit**: Yeah, we draw the line at 1231, 23.
**Asupit**: So I wouldn't update 2022, but we have to get.
**Asupit**: In order to get 24.
**Asupit**: Right.
**Asupit**: We have to start with 23 correctly.
**Asupit**: And so, you know, you would still have 24.
**Justin**: Right, right.
**Justin**: But it just.
**Justin**: The margins would not.
**Justin**: The margins would just look a little weird.
**Justin**: Although at a point in time, if the whip in 24 reflected actual costs and actual revenues, it would be accurate.
**Justin**: But it wouldn't.
**Justin**: The matching, let's say the matching principle, obviously, like, due to the recognition in 23, that would look weird.
**Justin**: Right?
**Justin**: But yeah, my question is how would that from an audit standpoint, like, if you make a testament that, hey, you know, as of December 31, 2024, all costs and revenues at that point in time that are displayed or accurate, like, but would that not make the audit any less credible?
**Justin**: I guess.
**Justin**: Do you see Where I'm going with that.
**Asupit**: So.
**Asupit**: So our audit.
**Asupit**: Yes, and I appreciate the question.
**Asupit**: So the audit, we.
**Asupit**: Financial statements will have a full year PNL for 2024.
**Asupit**: Right.
**Asupit**: And so on.
**Asupit**: That in that year it's revenue for an entire year and it's cost for an entire year.
**Asupit**: Okay.
**Asupit**: So let's just assume they had one job and it's Ulta Dallas.
**Asupit**: What's gonna.
**Asupit**: What's gonna be on our P L is 861,000 in revenue and 54,000 in cost with a gross margin of 54%.
**Justin**: 94%.
**Asupit**: Excuse me, 94%.
**Justin**: Sure.
**Asupit**: And so to me that's, you know, did.
**Asupit**: Is that reflective of the actual revenue that they earned, what they worked on and what the cost was actually incurred for?
**Asupit**: So Fatima brought up an example yesterday where they can pay subcontractors in advance, but there would be no work done.
**Asupit**: That's fine.
**Asupit**: That would be an asset.
**Asupit**: Right.
**Asupit**: That would go in column U where you have cost and accessibility because they haven't billed for that yet from the.
**Asupit**: And customer in order to pay for their subcontractors.
**Asupit**: And so that's the.
**Asupit**: The P and L part is the most important part for fixing 2023 so that our P&L for 24 is accurate.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I have a question.
**Bclymer**: So let.
**Bclymer**: Let's say we redo the WIP for 2023.
**Bclymer**: We have to kind of rely on the prior year balances.
**Bclymer**: Prior year to date.
**Bclymer**: Kind of like what we are doing here.
**Bclymer**: And I guess that's what Justin was asking.
**Bclymer**: How far do we have to go back?
**Bclymer**: Because in order to get 2023.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: We would have to assume that 2022 year to date was correct.
**Asupit**: Yeah.
**Asupit**: So anything.
**Asupit**: I'm only concerned with the jobs that are affecting 2024.
**Asupit**: So if there's a job that started in 23 and ended in 24, we would definitely want that reconciled.
**Asupit**: If there was a job in 23 that was com.
**Asupit**: That was completed in 23, I don't want that.
**Asupit**: That's.
**Asupit**: That's history.
**Asupit**: That doesn't affect my audit period.
**Asupit**: That makes sense.
**Asupit**: So I think everything here, from what I'm seeing.
**Asupit**: So you told me the column b, those first two digits, that's the year it started.
**Asupit**: Right.
**Asupit**: Interesting.
**Asupit**: One of them says 25.
**Asupit**: Interesting.
**Asupit**: Okay, so the only one from 22 and I.
**Asupit**: Those are small.
**Asupit**: So if you want me to scope out those first four.
**Asupit**: Yep.
**Asupit**: Can you highlight those first four?
**Asupit**: Yeah.
**Asupit**: So I wouldn't be concerned about those because those were essentially 100 done at the end of 23.
**Asupit**: Right.
**Asupit**: You have a little bit of negative gross margin there.
**Asupit**: Or.
**Asupit**: Or.
**Asupit**: Yeah, negative gross margin.
**Asupit**: So you.
**Asupit**: It's small in totality, so I would skip those.
**Asupit**: No need to reconcile those.
**Asupit**: Everything from row 28.
**Asupit**: Sorry.
**Asupit**: Yeah, 28 down, you definitely want to reconcile and get.
**Asupit**: Right.
**Asupit**: Because those are jobs that go into 2024.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Asupit**: Completed in 24.
**Asupit**: Sorry.
**Asupit**: Go ahead, Justin.
**Asupit**: Sorry.
**Justin**: And.
**Justin**: And Alta Dallas.
**Mcalcetero**: Right.
**Justin**: There's one more.
**Justin**: Those are the ones.
**Justin**: Right.
**Justin**: That you're concerned about.
**Asupit**: And Ulta Altadellas is probably the biggest one.
**Bclymer**: The biggest one.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Asupit**: Right.
**Asupit**: So don't worry about the ones in green.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Asupit**: Just to the other ones, row 12 to 20, those all started in 24.
**Asupit**: So those should be pretty good.
**Justin**: Ayat.
**Justin**: And you want them to amend a 23 return and refile.
**Asupit**: So that.
**Asupit**: That's up to the tax preparer.
**Asupit**: I think ultimately it's too early to determine what the P and L effect on the 2023 financials and tax return is until we.
**Asupit**: Because it could be, you know, because what I'm seeing is there's revenue in 23 that should be in 24, and then there's revenue in 24 that should have been in 23.
**Asupit**: So I don't know how it's all going to play out and how it's going to affect 23 at this point.
**Asupit**: Right.
**Asupit**: And so once we get, you know, kind of cleaner numbers, if you will, then we can say, all right, then Brandon can go to his tax preparer and say, hey, we had these adjustments in 23.
**Asupit**: Do we need to amend or can we flow Those through the 24 return?
**Asupit**: I've seen it done both ways.
**Asupit**: I'm not a tax guy.
**Asupit**: I don't know Brandon's personal situation, but we would have to see how the numbers come out to.
**Justin**: I mean, and that's the same thing.
**Justin**: It's just when he pays the taxes.
**Asupit**: Of course, the timing matter.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Justin**: And then.
**Justin**: So with that in mind, and with this being a timing matter in mind, what we want to do is we want to go in 23, take these jobs and just get the earned revenues accurate and reflective of costs and have a number there for you, and then basically bring 24 to reflect proper margins.
**Justin**: So you're comfortable with the PNL for 24.
**Asupit**: Right.
**Asupit**: Correct.
**Asupit**: So your column.
**Asupit**: AI.
**Asupit**: What.
**Asupit**: What did we.
**Asupit**: Kevin, go to the left.
**Asupit**: We estimate a gross margin for each one of these jobs.
**Asupit**: Right.
**Asupit**: In column S.
**Asupit**: Right.
**Asupit**: I think that's what you were saying yesterday, Fatima.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Asupit**: Okay, so if that's what Brandon is budgeting.
**Asupit**: He's gonna make 27 on this job.
**Asupit**: 63 on just this job.
**Asupit**: 21%.
**Asupit**: We should see that being.
**Asupit**: It doesn't have to be exactly the same because this is all estimate at the end of the day, but it should be within a reasonable range of what the initial estimate was.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Justin**: So can I see.
**Justin**: Can we go to 23?
**Justin**: If you go all the way to the right to the whip.
**Justin**: I'm curious.
**Justin**: What was interesting.
**Justin**: So his.
**Justin**: His revenue versus cost there.
**Justin**: Give him.
**Justin**: What is that?
**Justin**: What's his margin?
**Justin**: 1176-6416-8593-6217.
**Justin**: I mean, that's in line with his actual margin.
**Justin**: So then my question is, is there.
**Justin**: How could that be if he had such a large cost up there?
**Justin**: Yumeli Is that.
**Justin**: Sorry, not emailing.
**Justin**: Fatima is line 40.
**Justin**: Line 40, column A N the 5.682722.
**Justin**: Is that summing the jobs up top?
**Justin**: No, it's not.
**Justin**: It's not summing up the jobs in progress.
**Asupit**: If.
**Bclymer**: If you scroll down to line 52.
**Bclymer**: Right there.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And.
**Bclymer**: And remember, these are only the jobs that had activity in 2024.
**Bclymer**: So this is not all his costs for 2023.
**Bclymer**: The ones that ended in 2023 are not on this list.
**Justin**: Okay, understood.
**Justin**: So he had.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Justin**: And you can see a cost of revenues on these three line items.
**Justin**: Zion Pratt, Goodwill, Wesleyan office.
**Justin**: Why is there a cost of revenues there but no earned revenue?
**Justin**: Is that because they went over budget on those or what?
**Justin**: Why is there no build to earned revenue if there's a cost associated to those?
**Bclymer**: They didn't bill anything.
**Bclymer**: They didn't have any AR invoices on those jobs.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And since there was no Whip adjustment in 2023 based on the numbers in the system, they basically recognize everything they built for.
**Justin**: I see.
**Justin**: And.
**Mcalcetero**: Is that the issue?
**Mcalcetero**: It's because we're recognizing revenues by billings and not actual costs that incurred.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: In 2023, that's.
**Bclymer**: That was what happened.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: And if you notice, on the Wesleyan job, line 32, the same thing happened on the Cormac job.
**Bclymer**: It'll say it started in like 24, but there's a little bit of cost in the, you know, the prior year.
**Asupit**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Justin**: They could have potentially.
**Justin**: Fatima, Are they.
**Justin**: I'm curious, what the.
**Justin**: They didn't file cash basis returns for 23, did they?
**Justin**: Fatima?
**Bclymer**: I.
**Bclymer**: I'll have to double check.
**Justin**: Hey, y'all, did we see a return for 23 to see if maybe it was a cash races return?
**Asupit**: I, I didn't request a, a tax return for 23.
**Justin**: All right, so we can talk to, we can talk to Brandon about this and just add.
**Justin**: So we understand we want to just go back for now.
**Justin**: Let's put the tax returns aside.
**Justin**: We want to go back right now and normalize 23 revenue and costs and bring the cost into 24 for the jobs that just recognize billings as expenses.
**Justin**: Right?
**Asupit**: Correct, correct.
**Justin**: And like what are you looking for in, in totality?
**Justin**: Just so I make sure like we are set in the right direction here.
**Justin**: You want us to basically redo a 2023 year end whip and make sure it's accurate from properly recognizing the revenue and then see where we are at year end 23 and then bring whatever's left over into 24 and have a revitalized whip that shows these, this data to you.
**Justin**: Right.
**Justin**: That's what you want.
**Justin**: And then anything else from a tax to a standpoint, that's on us.
**Asupit**: Yeah, Let me, if I can more or less, but if I can clarify a couple things.
**Justin**: Sure.
**Asupit**: We, our main focus is the 2024 whip.
**Asupit**: Right.
**Asupit**: We want to get that right.
**Asupit**: And so if something seems off, just like the jobs that we pointed off earlier, if we need, I, I don't need to see a 2023 whip, that would be the cleanest way, but I don't need to see a 2023 whip.
**Asupit**: If I'm looking at 2024 and I'm able to look at this and say, yep, this thing jives with how it was budgeted out.
**Asupit**: Right.
**Asupit**: And the gross margins are within whatever he has estimated to begin with.
**Asupit**: I'm looking at him, he look, it looks like it's an average of 20% margin on, on these jobs is what he's targeted, if I were to guess.
**Asupit**: And so, yes, so, and then, so that's the kind of the thought process.
**Asupit**: I'm starting with 24 and then if I have to reconcile for 23 books.
**Asupit**: Right.
**Asupit**: If I'm looking at 23 books, then the adjustments were made there in order to get 24.
**Asupit**: Right.
**Asupit**: It is, that's, that's how I would approach the, the project, if you will.
**Asupit**: But yes, to answer your question, the cleanest way, the most straightforward way would be to do a 23 week.
**Bclymer**: And when we do, when we do that, we have to kind of confirm the contract amounts at that point.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Because just in case there were any change orders in 2024, we have to use the contract amount as of year end 23 for 23, is that correct?
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, that's a cutoff to making sure that the cutoff is reasonable.
**Mcalcetero**: So I think that you showed us during our walkthroughs that you were able to see the change orders in Procore.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah.
**Mcalcetero**: So that's where you just want to make sure that you don't add any change orders from 2024 to your calculation.
**Mcalcetero**: Only 2023 change orders and contract.
**Asupit**: Okay, Kevin, number row 28 and 29, those are essentially done in 23, right?
**Asupit**: Can you go to the left?
**Asupit**: It was, like, 100% done, right?
**Kjin**: Yes.
**Asupit**: All right, highlight those green.
**Asupit**: So don't worry about those.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Justin**: Team up.
**Justin**: We have the 23 returns.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Asupit**: Keep, Kevin, keep.
**Asupit**: Keep those green that were green, and then add those.
**Asupit**: 28 and 29 should also be green.
**Asupit**: I want to show them which ones not to worry about, just from a materiality perspective.
**Justin**: Fatima, can we talk with the CPA about the 23 return?
**Justin**: And a whip attached to 23 return.
**Justin**: Is there a whip around the 23 return?
**Justin**: Do we have anything?
**Bclymer**: No, there was no whip.
**Asupit**: Go to the.
**Asupit**: Go to the right.
**Asupit**: Kevin, what data did he take?
**Mcalcetero**: In general, does the accounting system.
**Mcalcetero**: Does it retain earnings roll, or is there any variance or significant variances from 2023 to 2024 or in general equity?
**Justin**: I wouldn't know.
**Bclymer**: I don't know.
**Bclymer**: I have to double Chen in atomatica, right?
**Mcalcetero**: Correct.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah.
**Justin**: You mean against the tax return or in general, if the retained earnings rolls?
**Mcalcetero**: Just in general retained earnings.
**Mcalcetero**: So if it doesn't roll that.
**Mcalcetero**: That could be a red flag, too, if it's off by a significant material amount.
**Justin**: No, I'm sure it would roll.
**Justin**: Fathoma, you can check, but you would check your N23 and.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay, yeah.
**Kjin**: And that.
**Mcalcetero**: That would be kind of like a confidence check, right?
**Mcalcetero**: If everything rolls together, there's a significant variance, and then.
**Mcalcetero**: Then there's something wrong.
**Justin**: Maybe Brandon's gonna have an explanation as to what happened in 23.
**Justin**: I mean, well, I think it's a good idea we talk to him and be like, hey, like, here's what IAD's running into.
**Justin**: Here we are showing jobs in 24 with a 94 margin.
**Justin**: For example, Alta Dallas, I think, is the huge sore thumb.
**Justin**: Right.
**Justin**: Like, the rest of the jobs, to me, are not that significant or material.
**Justin**: Or do we see any other ones?
**Asupit**: No, for sure.
**Asupit**: So anything that's not highlighted green, I think we have to at least revisit.
**Asupit**: So for, for example, number the second job.
**Asupit**: Create escapes.
**Asupit**: You know, did.
**Asupit**: Was there zero work done?
**Asupit**: We just had cost in 23 that was expensed.
**Asupit**: Do we need to put book that as an asset cost in excess of billings?
**Asupit**: Because it may affect 24.
**Justin**: Okay, well, we can walk through these with Brennan and get, get his understanding of what happened, because we have no idea either.
**Justin**: We weren't here in 23, so I don't know exactly what happened.
**Justin**: But, Fatima, like, we've confirmed these figures with the project manager.
**Justin**: I forgot his name.
**Bclymer**: Right, Jesse.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: The year to date is what we confirmed and the fiscal year to date.
**Bclymer**: He did, he would.
**Bclymer**: He didn't know what the prior year numbers were.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Asupit**: All right.
**Asupit**: I mean, my humble recommendation is to take the ones in green, maybe all of them, except Spectator Vegas, and just flush everything through 2023.
**Asupit**: I mean, it doesn't seem like there was much in 24 on these jobs.
**Justin**: Sorry, one more time.
**Asupit**: Those.
**Asupit**: The jobs in green where we have some cost but no revenue, it seems like those were basically done in 2023.
**Asupit**: So I would take these maybe, except Spectator Vegas because it had some billings, some revenue in 24, I would take these and I would flush it through 2023.
**Asupit**: Meaning don't even show them as on the wit for 24.
**Justin**: Okay, Fatima, take note of this, right?
**Asupit**: Because it, I mean, it nets out to like 5k.
**Asupit**: Well, I don't.
**Asupit**: Nobody wants to deal with it, right?
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Asupit**: And then I don't know about Spectator Vegas.
**Asupit**: Probably on this, on the smaller end.
**Asupit**: I don't know if it throws off billings, but I'll leave that up to you guys.
**Asupit**: So I, I, basically what I'm trying to say is anything green, I'm not worried about anything that's, you know, purple or white.
**Asupit**: You know, for example, Core Mark and Siva, again, we had core mark had 81k in just cost.
**Asupit**: 0,0 revenue.
**Asupit**: So we got to reconcile that maybe there's too much cost in 24.
**Asupit**: Should have been in 23.
**Justin**: Yeah, yeah.
**Justin**: We'll normalize these.
**Justin**: We'll take a look at year end 23, reconcile it, get the costs and revenues properly allocated for that year, and then bring it into a proper 2024.
**Justin**: 2024 whip.
**Justin**: And present that to you.
**Justin**: Right?
**Asupit**: Yeah, exactly.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Justin**: Fatima, you following?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: All right, I do, I do.
**Bclymer**: So one more thing.
**Bclymer**: If the items in green, if we kind of push those over to 2023, then the cost to date of 2024 will not tie to the trial balance.
**Asupit**: Well, you're.
**Asupit**: If you're going to move it from 24 to 23, you're going to your trial balance for both years is going to change.
**Bclymer**: So we include it in the adjustment.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Justin**: You would push it out of 24 and into 23.
**Justin**: Fatima.
**Asupit**: And I think that would be fine for all of them.
**Asupit**: Except maybe Spectre Vega probably is going to be fine for Spectre Vegas, but I'll leave it up to you guys.
**Justin**: I'd rather make the.
**Justin**: I'd rather make the whip as minimal and clean as possible for us to.
**Justin**: For you guys to set your focus on other things.
**Asupit**: Exactly.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Justin**: All right, Fatima, so let's do.
**Justin**: Let's put in a note for that and then do we.
**Justin**: Yeah, I think we just have the discussion with Brandon about what our next steps are and just get his buy in before we start the work.
**Asupit**: Okay.
**Asupit**: Yeah, sounds good.
**Asupit**: So it seems like we'll set up another call for 1pm our time or Pacific time.
**Asupit**: Sorry.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Asupit**: And then we'll.
**Asupit**: We'll get.
**Asupit**: We'll get Brandon's insight on these.
**Justin**: Sounds good.
**Asupit**: Yeah.
**Fnjie**: You already told him that you.
**Fnjie**: You really need him on this meeting.
**Fnjie**: Just to clarify a lot of stuff.
**Fnjie**: So we'll keep you posted if anything happens.
**Fnjie**: But I.
**Fnjie**: I ask him to please join the next minute.
**Fnjie**: So I'll keep you posted.
**Asupit**: Okay.
**Asupit**: Sounds good.
**Asupit**: Kevin or Adrian, let's send an invite for.
**Asupit**: For 1pm okay.
**Asupit**: All right.
**Asupit**: Excellent.
**Asupit**: Anything else?
**Asupit**: You guys had questions for us before let you go?
**Justin**: No.
**Justin**: No, thank you.
**Justin**: I appreciate it, brother.
**Asupit**: All right.
**Asupit**: Thanks, Justin.
**Justin**: Take care.
**Fnjie**: Thank you.
**Fnjie**: Thank you.
**Asupit**: Okay.
**Asupit**: By.
**Justin**: Sa.
