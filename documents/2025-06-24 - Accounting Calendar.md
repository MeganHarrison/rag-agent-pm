## Transcript
**Accounting**: Hi, Fatima.
**Accounting**: Hello.
**Accounting**: How are you?
**Accounting**: How are you?
**Fnjie**: Good.
**Accounting**: How are you?
**Accounting**: So now you are with Loom.
**Accounting**: No, more with Think Plum.
**Accounting**: Think Plum.
**Accounting**: It's.
**Fnjie**: It's the same company.
**Fnjie**: We just.
**Fnjie**: We used to be Plum.
**Fnjie**: Now we're Loom.
**Fnjie**: So we've kind of changed to Loom for.
**Fnjie**: It's been a few months now, but we officially.
**Fnjie**: It is making us switch our emails.
**Fnjie**: And that's always, always an issue.
**Fnjie**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: All right, young lady.
**Accounting**: So that's good.
**Accounting**: Let me just.
**Accounting**: Because they want to be here.
**Accounting**: So I don't know what is Jose, and I don't think accounting is gonna join.
**Accounting**: But that's okay, Fritzi.
**Accounting**: But it's.
**Accounting**: What is Jose?
**Accounting**: He said he will join.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Accounting**: He wants to see Jose.
**Accounting**: Jose, see me in this.
**Accounting**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: Do we need the meeting?
**Accounting**: Okay, so.
**Accounting**: So he will join and then we.
**Accounting**: Okay, one second.
**Accounting**: Do we have something?
**Accounting**: That's good?
**Accounting**: Okay, so what Brandon was saying is, so based on the calendar that we have, which is good, he wants to see.
**Accounting**: Let me show you here, the calendar.
**Accounting**: I'm going to share my screen with you.
**Accounting**: My window.
**Accounting**: It's fine.
**Accounting**: So what he wants to see here was, for example, he was asking, okay, so we have here, Chase download credit card transactions.
**Accounting**: So he said, is this monthly?
**Accounting**: And then when he moved here, he was like, oh, no, it's a monthly.
**Accounting**: So the question is, because he said this calendar is available for everybody, right?
**Accounting**: Like on the team.
**Accounting**: So they can see that they have to do this on time.
**Accounting**: So the question is, all these things here are going to be exactly the same for the next month.
**Accounting**: Because he said, to be honest, people don't care the due dates of the insurance, blah, blah, what they want to see.
**Accounting**: It's, you know, like the calendars or reminders they need to do.
**Accounting**: For example, what.
**Accounting**: What Jose just sent, like, hey, don't forget to code your transactions, blah, blah, blah.
**Accounting**: So those are the things he wants to see.
**Accounting**: So I don't know how much of the changes we will need to do here.
**Fnjie**: Okay, so what.
**Fnjie**: What Jose did.
**Fnjie**: And I'm not sure if you saw my email.
**Fnjie**: In my email, I told.
**Fnjie**: Because download Chase credit cards, all that stuff.
**Fnjie**: That's for him.
**Fnjie**: Right.
**Fnjie**: Because the project managers are not downloading these credit cards.
**Fnjie**: Jose is downloading this.
**Fnjie**: These transactions.
**Fnjie**: Yeah.
**Fnjie**: So the reminders he added on here are for him.
**Fnjie**: But he.
**Accounting**: He.
**Fnjie**: In my email, I told him to go in and update all the rest of the months, you know, throughout the end of the year.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: So he needs to update.
**Accounting**: It makes sense.
**Accounting**: And then Also Fritz, he wants to do the due dates for the insurance.
**Accounting**: Like, I mean, so Brenda was saying like the due dates for the insurance is more like for you guys, like internal type of thing.
**Accounting**: So if you want to add it to the calendar, maybe just adding you in this email and then maybe Fritzi and then Jose.
**Accounting**: But then he said so for the reminders he's Jose.
**Accounting**: So if he's going to do the reminders, you know, like monthly like what he said like if it's every six days or a weekly or I don't know, month to month, just add them to this calendar so they will understand from.
**Accounting**: Because everybody has access to this calendar so they can see they have to go and it'll.
**Accounting**: They will receive a reminder for.
**Accounting**: Okay, so you're good.
**Accounting**: It's just more on Jose's side.
**Fnjie**: Yeah.
**Fnjie**: So mine.
**Fnjie**: The one I added the credit card.
**Fnjie**: If you want to share the screen again.
**Fnjie**: The one I added like the.
**Fnjie**: The credit card due, due date.
**Fnjie**: That can be a.
**Fnjie**: That's like a reminder to everybody.
**Fnjie**: Code all your credit cards by that.
**Fnjie**: That date of every month.
**Fnjie**: So I can do the financials credit card coding.
**Accounting**: Do please call an attach.
**Accounting**: Receives AOD So this is for everybody?
**Fnjie**: This is for everybody.
**Fnjie**: It's supposed to be for.
**Fnjie**: For everybody.
**Fnjie**: All the.
**Fnjie**: All everybody that has a credit card.
**Accounting**: So actually we need to tag people here so they can get a.
**Accounting**: A message.
**Accounting**: So for example.
**Accounting**: Okay, so so you can talk but.
**Fnjie**: Actually you're gonna tag everybody with a credit card.
**Accounting**: But is there something that we can like select everybody?
**Accounting**: Like I don't know like what happens?
**Accounting**: Oh yeah, no link to page because you know, I don't want you to do one by one.
**Accounting**: Like that's gonna take you forever.
**Accounting**: So is it like you can do.
**Fnjie**: The Aliado group team.
**Fnjie**: I just saw that.
**Accounting**: But this is a page.
**Accounting**: So if you see for example here where it says a little group.
**Accounting**: One second.
**Accounting**: A little.
**Accounting**: Ah, Jesus Christ.
**Accounting**: Here where it says a little groups.
**Accounting**: Oh, team.
**Accounting**: Yeah, this isn't.
**Accounting**: But this is a page.
**Fnjie**: Oh.
**Accounting**: If you click here, it's going to take you to a.
**Accounting**: You know what, Let me check really quick.
**Accounting**: Can you.
**Accounting**: I'm pretty sure you can because notion is very.
**Fnjie**: Yeah, I put that on there so they can get reminders.
**Fnjie**: And I think the another thing also is like, oh, maybe we can do like a weekly reminder.
**Fnjie**: Every Friday they get a reminder from Notion all your credit cards.
**Accounting**: Oh, that's really sad.
**Accounting**: No, Notion doesn't have a built in feature to tag everyone in a workspace at once.
**Accounting**: However, you can tag a group of people by creating a group mention using the add mention feature and selecting predefined group according to.
**Accounting**: So how can I do that?
**Accounting**: Not just allow to create groups of people within your workspace.
**Accounting**: You can then mention the group name to notify all members.
**Accounting**: Okay, but how can I do the group?
**Accounting**: So if I go.
**Fnjie**: Yeah, it looks like you have to create a group outside of maybe exit this.
**Fnjie**: Create a group.
**Accounting**: Yeah, but where do I.
**Accounting**: Here, let me see.
**Accounting**: So this is everybody.
**Accounting**: So this is everybody.
**Accounting**: Full access.
**Fnjie**: Okay, so you see how it says team space?
**Accounting**: Oh, yeah.
**Accounting**: No, where on the left team is creasing here.
**Fnjie**: Yeah.
**Fnjie**: Maybe you can add a new.
**Fnjie**: Add a new group.
**Fnjie**: Like it says team.
**Accounting**: But so where it says team.
**Accounting**: This is for example, if you click here, this is a page.
**Accounting**: If you click for example, here, this is another page.
**Accounting**: So if I click on add new, I'm going to create a new page, you see, Not a group.
**Accounting**: So what I want to see is.
**Accounting**: I'm pretty sure it's just with mentions, but according to motion.
**Accounting**: So how to create a group?
**Accounting**: On how to create a group mention in notion, the creator mentioned first you need to create a group within your notion workspace.
**Accounting**: Workspace owners and memberships.
**Accounting**: Admin can create groups that go into settings.
**Accounting**: People, remembers.
**Accounting**: Okay, people or members.
**Accounting**: He said settings, right?
**Accounting**: People are members.
**Accounting**: I'm here.
**Accounting**: Okay, groups.
**Accounting**: And then select creating a group.
**Accounting**: So groups.
**Accounting**: We have several groups.
**Accounting**: We have two guests, which is awesome.
**Accounting**: Creative.
**Accounting**: Okay, so this is good.
**Accounting**: So we're gonna go like a little.
**Accounting**: A little members.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: I would call it a little CC holders.
**Fnjie**: Like credit card holders.
**Accounting**: A little CC holder.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Accounting**: And then let's add them.
**Accounting**: So members.
**Accounting**: How can I edit?
**Accounting**: Okay, this is created.
**Accounting**: So how can I.
**Accounting**: Okay, add members.
**Accounting**: So who are they?
**Accounting**: So they are Brandon, aj, Nick, Jesse, Kevin, myself, because I now have a credit card.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Accounting**: Andres doesn't have it.
**Accounting**: Jose doesn't have it.
**Accounting**: Accounting doesn't have it.
**Accounting**: Glenda Charmet has it.
**Fnjie**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: Glenn, my person.
**Accounting**: Alex, you don't have it.
**Accounting**: Andrew has it.
**Accounting**: Chad has it.
**Accounting**: Jack has it.
**Accounting**: Ian doesn't have it.
**Accounting**: And these are just invites.
**Accounting**: So now I have a credit card.
**Accounting**: Just so you know.
**Accounting**: So this is for subscriptions and everything.
**Accounting**: So I have to check how to.
**Accounting**: Like the.
**Accounting**: Sorry for the noise.
**Accounting**: We have to do the codes.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Accounting**: So I'm going to add them.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Accounting**: So everybody's in this group.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Accounting**: A little CC holders.
**Accounting**: So did you.
**Accounting**: No, but you guys are not going to be there because you don't need it.
**Fnjie**: No, no, no, we're not.
**Fnjie**: We're not.
**Accounting**: Okay, so that's good.
**Accounting**: So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.
**Accounting**: Correct.
**Accounting**: This is the amount of people.
**Accounting**: Perfect.
**Accounting**: So now that I'm here.
**Accounting**: So for example, if we go to a little group accounting and we go to the calendar and we go here.
**Accounting**: So for example, here frequency at a property, we can do person or something, call it like where is this person here?
**Accounting**: So we can change it to group.
**Accounting**: And then in empty, we can just stack here.
**Accounting**: Alito.
**Accounting**: It was CC holders, correct?
**Fnjie**: Yeah, CC holders.
**Accounting**: I see.
**Fnjie**: I think in the property maybe you should make a group or are you able to.
**Accounting**: It should be.
**Accounting**: Yeah, 14 more.
**Accounting**: I.
**Accounting**: No, no, no, not just 14, a little 15.
**Accounting**: 15 more results.
**Accounting**: I want to see that.
**Accounting**: Oh, there you go.
**Accounting**: So a little CC holder.
**Accounting**: So we have them here, but let me see if we can add here.
**Accounting**: Oh no, you know what, because you're right, this is only one person.
**Accounting**: No, actually you see that it changed it to group.
**Fnjie**: I think you changed the name to group also.
**Fnjie**: Person.
**Fnjie**: Person.
**Accounting**: So is there something called group?
**Fnjie**: Okay, scroll down, let's see.
**Accounting**: But that's fine.
**Accounting**: We can just.
**Accounting**: It's okay, we don't need to have that one.
**Accounting**: But if we do a little.
**Accounting**: There you go.
**Accounting**: A little CC holders.
**Accounting**: There you go.
**Accounting**: So instead of adding it as a person, we just added as a text.
**Accounting**: So everybody now is here tag.
**Accounting**: So inside that group.
**Accounting**: So we can.
**Accounting**: I'll change this later, you know, the icon or whatever, we can just make it like a person.
**Accounting**: I don't know, this one group.
**Accounting**: Okay, perfect.
**Accounting**: And then a little CC holders.
**Accounting**: So this is the one.
**Accounting**: And then just to make sure, tag them as well here, just double tags because that's, that's perfect.
**Accounting**: And then we just click here and then this is it.
**Accounting**: So everybody you see here, correct?
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: Yes.
**Accounting**: Okay, so, so that's good.
**Accounting**: And then.
**Accounting**: So what do we.
**Accounting**: What do we.
**Accounting**: What do we need to do next?
**Accounting**: So we need to wait on Jose to update this and then I'm going to update them on the Outlook calendar.
**Fnjie**: Yeah, so I added it to every month for the end of the year.
**Fnjie**: So can you.
**Fnjie**: If you go to July, you'll see it there.
**Fnjie**: Can you tag everybody in the other months too?
**Accounting**: So this one, right?
**Fnjie**: Oh no, this one, yeah, from July to December.
**Accounting**: So yeah, so it's good because this is already added.
**Accounting**: So empty.
**Accounting**: And let's do Alito.
**Accounting**: Sissy holders.
**Accounting**: And then just to make sure that they're receiving it A little CC holders and then we click it.
**Fnjie**: So I don't know if we should.
**Fnjie**: Because the credit cards are coded monthly, right?
**Fnjie**: I mean, we get the statements monthly.
**Fnjie**: And so I don't know if Brendan wants a weekly reminder to send, but.
**Fnjie**: But a lot.
**Fnjie**: Most of the guys are pretty good with.
**Fnjie**: With their cards, but.
**Accounting**: Okay, so.
**Accounting**: So to be honest, he said it's up to you guys, whoever, like, whatever you guys are doing.
**Accounting**: So.
**Accounting**: So this is working for the team and it's also working for you guys, and we can keep it monthly.
**Accounting**: And I know they're really responsive.
**Accounting**: You're right.
**Accounting**: They're very like.
**Fnjie**: Yeah, they're very good.

**Fnjie**: You see it right, right there.
**Fnjie**: The 27.
**Accounting**: Yes, yes, you're right.

**Fnjie**: So you only need to set it up one time.
**Accounting**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: But my question is, you said.
**Accounting**: Oh yeah, only every Friday, right?
**Fnjie**: Yes, yes.
**Fnjie**: And it's already there when you set up that one and you made it recurring every two weeks.
**Fnjie**: It's there.
**Fnjie**: So if you go through the calendar every two weeks, you'll see it on that, right?
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Accounting**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: You can see here like already this is Brandon's.
**Accounting**: Like Jack already did it.
**Accounting**: Nick already accepted it.

**Accounting**: I don't know how I'll send it.
**Accounting**: So in order to get your access.
