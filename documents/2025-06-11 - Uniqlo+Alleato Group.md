## Transcript
**Aelkarrimy**: Is Jesuque.
**Bclymer**: He's leaving me on red, so I'm just waiting for him to respond.
**Bclymer**: Oh, he's typing.
**Bclymer**: Apologies team.
**Bclymer**: He just said give me a sec.
**Jdawson**: Sam.
**Kevin.ly**: Brandon, can you join?
**Aelkarrimy**: What do you mean can I join?
**Mparsons**: Okay, this is a big meeting.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Seven, is anyone else from Uniqlo joining?
**Mparsons**: Mine should be joining shortly.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Oh, hello, Brandon.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I'm on.
**Aelkarrimy**: Howdy.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Thank you for joining.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I heard that.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I've heard from Ahmed that you're not joining.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: But you join, you make it.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Thank you.
**Aelkarrimy**: I said, I said, I cannot guarantee it, you know that I can be on every meeting.
**Aelkarrimy**: But whenever Ahmed told me that it was Yuzuk that specifically asked for me to be on, I made sure that I moved everything possible to grace you with my presence.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay, thank you very much for your effort.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Thank you.
**Mparsons**: This might be too big a meeting for this discussion that we wanted to have or I wanted to have with Brandon.
**Mparsons**: Does it make sense?
**Aelkarrimy**: I suggest we probably do a like a one on one meeting separately.
**Aelkarrimy**: That's what I emailed back.
**Aelkarrimy**: I think that's probably wise.
**Aelkarrimy**: This is a just a weekly progress update construction meeting.
**Aelkarrimy**: So I think, you know, I don't know, like I said, maybe this week or early next week if you have some one on one time, I think it'd be better for you and I to jump on a call.
**Mparsons**: Well, Brandon, unless you need to be on this one right now, can you and I just peel off and just call.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah, certainly.
**Mparsons**: One calls the other.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah, certainly.
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: I'm in the states.
**Aelkarrimy**: Are you local?
**Aelkarrimy**: All right, cool.
**Aelkarrimy**: My.
**Aelkarrimy**: My cell phone is in my signature.
**Aelkarrimy**: Just give me a shout.
**Mparsons**: I'll look for it.
**Bclymer**: Put it in this chat, sir, right now, just so you have it.
**Aelkarrimy**: I just said it.
**Bschwartz**: You did?
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Mparsons**: Okay, so Brandon, I'll call you in two minutes.
**Aelkarrimy**: All right, thanks.
**Mparsons**: Thank you.
**Bclymer**: All right, kba, I think.
**Bclymer**: I think it's safe for us to continue course and just start with the weekly call.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yep.
**Bschwartz**: All right, I'm gonna share my screen and we can go through the agenda.
**Bschwartz**: Okay, so you guys might all know already that we do have the permits ready and Mike is going to pick them up and make payment on Monday, flying back to Jersey to do that this weekend.
**Bschwartz**: So for material status, I guess we might need to do a separate discussion on the electric because there are some materials that we have already ordered and the electrician has them at his warehouse and there are already changes happening, so guess we might have to have some discussion on that for what is on the submittals.
**Bschwartz**: And what is changing.
**Bschwartz**: Maybe tomorrow I can set up a meeting for us to discuss that.
**Bclymer**: Just really quick, Brian.
**Bclymer**: Wasn't the electrical submitted submittal revise and resubmit status on it?
**Bschwartz**: Yes, it does.
**Bschwartz**: So I think at the beginning of the project, there were concerns about material lead time.
**Bschwartz**: And for.
**Bschwartz**: One of the comments on the submittals was that of the high bay lights.
**Bschwartz**: So the one that we ordered was from the same manufacturer, but is slightly different when you look at the details.
**Bschwartz**: But it.
**Bschwartz**: The electrician was telling me they could match the lumen and the color of what is on site currently.
**Bschwartz**: But because of there was a schedule issue at the beginning, they were I guess told to go ahead and order this one that we have in the submittals.
**Bschwartz**: And I think on the submittal you did put a screenshot of what is currently on site for.
**Bschwartz**: From the same manufacturer, but they are slightly different.
**Bclymer**: And it's just that we actually coordinated that with fast retail just to make sure that they're okay with the alternate.
**Bclymer**: And based off of our conversations with Yasuke and the team, they wanted to try to maintain the same specification that they have already installed within the warehouse.
**Bschwartz**: Okay.
**Bschwartz**: Yeah.
**Bschwartz**: As far as I know, from what I heard from the electrician, the only way you'd be able to tell the difference is when you are up there looking at it up close.
**Bschwartz**: Otherwise you can't tell from the.
**Bschwartz**: From the light, the lumens or the light color.
**Bschwartz**: So.
**Bclymer**: And functionality wise, it gives us the same functions.
**Bschwartz**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: So, Yusuke, are you okay with this alternate?
**Bclymer**: It looks exactly like what we have in the warehouse, but you will only notice the differences if you get to the top with a forklift.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Do you have any spec is also same.
**Bclymer**: Right?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Sorry.
**Bclymer**: Do you have any images of what the comparison looks like that we can look at?
**Bschwartz**: Yes, I can.
**Bschwartz**: And have it open.
**Bschwartz**: I'm going to open it up in a sec.
**Jdawson**: Sam.
**Bschwartz**: Okay.
**Bschwartz**: So this is the screenshot from Ahmed.
**Bschwartz**: And this is the one we submitted.
**Bschwartz**: Okay.
**Bschwartz**: Any issues with.
**Bclymer**: With proceeding with the.
**Bclymer**: With the alternate spec?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I think so.
**Bschwartz**: Okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: If the specification is the same like lumens and like.
**Bschwartz**: Right.
**Bschwartz**: So the lumen and so.
**Bschwartz**: So this one is.
**Bschwartz**: It is actually adjustable so we can change the light color when it gets installed to match exactly what is on site.
**Bschwartz**: And if it needs to be darker or if it needs to be dimmer or brighter, that is all adjustable.
**Bschwartz**: On this one.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I have no issue if those kind of other specs are the same.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Other than the look.
**Bschwartz**: Yeah.
**Bschwartz**: I think that the difference in the look Is mostly from the profile on the sides, but from the bottom, they all have the lights from coming from both sides.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah, no issue.
**Bschwartz**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Eva, if you want to, like, submit this submittal, like, split from everything one more time just so you got a stamp on it or if you're okay with it just on this call, then you're.
**Bclymer**: You're good to go with this with the installation.
**Bschwartz**: Okay, sounds good.
**Bschwartz**: So there are some other comments, too, with.
**Bschwartz**: I think the drawing needs to be this.
**Bschwartz**: The drawing they submitted needs to be revised, and he's working on that.
**Bclymer**: He.
**Bschwartz**: I think he was ready to submit until the.
**Bschwartz**: The new changes that happen.
**Bschwartz**: So he's holding on for now, but I'll let him know to.
**Bschwartz**: To proceed with those after we received those drawings from Brian today.
**Bschwartz**: Okay.
**Bschwartz**: So job site status.
**Bschwartz**: We haven't done any other work since we put up the fence.
**Bschwartz**: So on the schedule.
**Bschwartz**: The next thing on the schedule for us is to relocate the lights, and that's supposed to be starting on the 18th.
**Bschwartz**: So I spoke with the electrician today to, you know, to get.
**Bschwartz**: To get him ready.
**Bschwartz**: So he.
**Bschwartz**: He mentioned he was asking if the racking layout is done by now, because they normally use that to.
**Bschwartz**: To locate the lights when they relocate and when they moved on.
**Bschwartz**: Is that something that is.
**Bschwartz**: That is ready for them to proceed with?
**Jdawson**: Correct.
**Jdawson**: The racking layout is done.
**Bschwartz**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Aliato and everybody should have a copy of those, because that is in the.
**Jdawson**: That was in the submittal for the permits.
**Jdawson**: But, yes, that is where the rack is going to be.
**Jdawson**: Is.
**Bschwartz**: Is.
**Jdawson**: Is the place.
**Bschwartz**: Got it.
**Bschwartz**: Okay.
**Bschwartz**: And is.
**Bschwartz**: Is this done for plan A and B or it's just done with B for now?
**Jdawson**: Both are done.
**Bschwartz**: Okay.
**Bschwartz**: All right.
**Bschwartz**: So we might actually try to, if possible, consolidate these instead of them coming for this amount of days and then go back and then come back.
**Bschwartz**: They might do all at one, all in one shot.
**Bschwartz**: So it might actually be finished quicker than we have it on the schedule for submittals.
**Bschwartz**: The plumbing submittals, we did get approval today from the engineers, and we put.
**Bschwartz**: We sent it to Ahmed and the team today.
**Bschwartz**: And the fire sprinklers are approved on both sides, and electrical is being revised right now.
**Bschwartz**: So we should actually have that submitted, I believe, by the end of this week with the updated drawings.
**Bclymer**: Keva, do we have any.
**Bclymer**: Given the change in specification for that light, I'm sure that this one is cheaper than the other one.
**Bclymer**: Correct.
**Bschwartz**: I'm actually not sure if you can.
**Bclymer**: Just verify that, because I believe the unit per cost from one to the other is a little bit cheaper.
**Bschwartz**: Yeah, I can find out.
**Bclymer**: And then we can play with that credit elsewhere when needed.
**Bschwartz**: Okay.
**Bschwartz**: All right, I can.
**Bschwartz**: I'll find out and I'll send that information over.
**Bschwartz**: So last week we mostly talked about the coordination of work to.
**Bschwartz**: Between the electrician and to find out if there is.
**Bschwartz**: There is enough room or how much room they need to.
**Bschwartz**: To work.
**Bschwartz**: So they are aware of that.
**Bschwartz**: So we will be, I think next week when they are on site that can be finalized.
**Bschwartz**: Does anyone else have something else to add?
**Bclymer**: I think we can unravel the electrical conversation now.
**Jdawson**: Joe, do we want to go through it completely?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, we've got some time, so if you guys want to share screen and maybe let's try to iron this out.
**Jdawson**: Cody, you got a layout ready?
**Bryan.wagar**: Yep, I'm just getting it pulled up.
**Kevin.ly**: Just one second.
**Bryan.wagar**: I'm actually, before I open up the layout, I'm just going to start with kind of what we've.
**Bryan.wagar**: Well, I guess that is the layout, but I want to start with the E100 drawing that was sent over to us today.
**Bryan.wagar**: The main reason I asked the questions about the transformer location is because from.
**Kevin.ly**: The past E100 drawings, in the past.
**Bryan.wagar**: E100 drawings, we had like some of the transformers down here, especially for CSO1 and CSO2, and I thought that those.
**Kevin.ly**: Were going to be staying there.
**Bryan.wagar**: Maybe that was a.
**Bryan.wagar**: Maybe I just missed that in a communication somewhere.
**Bryan.wagar**: But in that new E100 that we got, those ended up moving upwards for that CSO1 to be right here and the CSO2 to be over here.
**Kevin.ly**: I asked for that size because it looks like there's a lot of space in this drawing.
**Bryan.wagar**: I'm not really sure why, but in.
**Kevin.ly**: The actual CAD that we have, there.
**Bryan.wagar**: Really isn't a lot of walking space in that area that those transformers were planning on being placed.
**Bryan.wagar**: So I took the.
**Bryan.wagar**: I took the drawing that.
**Bryan.wagar**: That you guys sent over just to see like how much room we would have if we had like the transformer place there.
**Bryan.wagar**: So the transformer that you guys wanted about right here, we can't really have them there because this is blocking a walking path to an area that we need to be able to access.
**Bryan.wagar**: And that goes for the same thing on the opposite side of the system too.
**Bryan.wagar**: So on the far right side.
**Bryan.wagar**: So that was the main reason I was asking those questions.
**Bryan.wagar**: So is there a reason why the CSO1 and the CSO2 transformers were moved?
**Bryan.wagar**: From the discussions that we've had on Friday and Monday.
**Cheryl.green**: Well, based on our discussions, I thought we were moving CSO1 and CSO2 closer to where those drops were, because those panels are.
**Cheryl.green**: Correct me if I'm wrong.
**Cheryl.green**: What's shown in yellow on the right hand side there.
**Bryan.wagar**: So that was for A1 and A2.
**Bryan.wagar**: I mean, not A1 and A2.
**Bryan.wagar**: That was for A1 and B1.
**Bryan.wagar**: So we were going to put one of those panels over here in this kind of blue square that I had.
**Bryan.wagar**: So those would be accurate with the E100 drawing over here.
**Bryan.wagar**: That would be the TLE6 and the TLE7.
**Cheryl.green**: Okay, sorry.
**Cheryl.green**: Naming convention still get mixed up there?
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah.
**Cheryl.green**: Can you go back to your drawing then?
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah.
**Cheryl.green**: So in terms of where we can mount them outside of the columns, where else it would be.
**Bryan.wagar**: Let me just zoom in a little bit because just to kind of show it a little bit better.
**Bryan.wagar**: So I know you asked about it.
**Bryan.wagar**: So the one that was going to be next to a 1, which would end up being somewhere over here.
**Kevin.ly**: Ish.
**Bryan.wagar**: So I'm worried about this one, which.
**Kevin.ly**: We kind of have some room to.
**Bryan.wagar**: Move it if you wanted.
**Bryan.wagar**: There's a small chance that we would.
**Kevin.ly**: Be able to fit it here.
**Bryan.wagar**: I'm just concerned about a walking path, um, because somebody would need to kind of come through this way at certain times to access like a step over that would.
**Bryan.wagar**: That's.
**Kevin.ly**: Oop.
**Bryan.wagar**: I didn't mean to access the step over.
**Bryan.wagar**: That's kind of where my cursor is right now.
**Bryan.wagar**: If we were really looking to see and like put it at like a.
**Bryan.wagar**: Like a prime optimization, I feel like it would be best to put it down at the column line that's just underneath it.
**Bryan.wagar**: I think that was originally where the.
**Kevin.ly**: CSO one was going to be.
**Bryan.wagar**: So somewhere like over here.
**Bryan.wagar**: And then we would just end up running a cable this way, which wouldn't be that big of an issue for us since that cable is in our scope.
**Bryan.wagar**: I believe that's where you originally had the E100 and the first drawing that you guys sent over.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah.
**Bryan.wagar**: You had the CSO one on the column line there.
**Bryan.wagar**: And we would just run the wire over to the power box how we needed it.
**Cheryl.green**: Okay, can you go back to your drawing for me?
**Cheryl.green**: Your file so that that transformer is feeding that red panel there?
**Bryan.wagar**: Yes.
**Cheryl.green**: Can that red panel be shifted to the left or right by six inches to a foot and the transformer just sit right next to it?
**Kevin.ly**: That might be.
**Kevin.ly**: Okay, let me.
**Bryan.wagar**: Drop drawing, but I.
**Kevin.ly**: Can go ahead and at least move this and see how much room we.
**Bryan.wagar**: Have, but there's a chance that we could probably put that right next to it.
**Cheryl.green**: Is your box to scale, too?
**Bryan.wagar**: Sorry, I think that's the one thing that we're actually not 100% sure on right now is that the box to scale.
**Cheryl.green**: So, sorry, I didn't mean your red panel box.
**Cheryl.green**: I meant the white box that you drew.
**Cheryl.green**: Is that the scale of our transition?
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Kevin.ly**: This is the.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, I think the drawing said roughly 700 by 760 millimeters, so that's what I drew that out to.
**Cheryl.green**: Okay.
**Cheryl.green**: So, yeah, to me, that looks like it would fit right next to that panel.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, I think.
**Bryan.wagar**: But you did bring it up, and I know in the sense that you didn't mean to bring it up, but this panel isn't 100% the size, the red one, and we're not sure what.
**Kevin.ly**: That size will be.
**Kevin.ly**: I am hoping that it's not going to be super large because in the.
**Bryan.wagar**: Sense of what we're looking at right now, this would be just about the same size or maybe like a one by one in terms of meters, which.
**Kevin.ly**: Should be able to fit in that space.
**Bryan.wagar**: But if you are okay with putting it here, we should also be okay with doing that.
**Bryan.wagar**: Unless you see an issue, Joe?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I think the more things we can get right next to each other, the better.
**Kevin.ly**: Okay, cool.
**Bryan.wagar**: So in that case, we would do that on this side, and then we kind of have the same thing on the other side of the system.
**Bryan.wagar**: So the CSO3, we would end up just putting another transformer in this area right here or what.
**Bryan.wagar**: Whether it's to the left or the right of it doesn't matter.
**Bryan.wagar**: But I also realized, and I'm going to go back to the E100 drawing real quick, that the original CSO2 placement, I agree that this one is a little bit far away, especially since the power box we're trying to power is actually kind of more in this area where my mouse is.
**Bryan.wagar**: So I was wondering.
**Bryan.wagar**: And I can go and cut to the CAD to show you in that as well.
**Bryan.wagar**: If we could put the CSO to somewhat close to this LE9 or in this area to show you where it is in the cad, that would be this red one in the middle.
**Kevin.ly**: I.
**Kevin.ly**: We might be able to fit the.
**Bryan.wagar**: Transformer actually in this area, so that might work as well.
**Kevin.ly**: Let me go ahead and grab that real quick.
**Bclymer**: Cody, can you.
**Bclymer**: Can your panel be mirrored in that location?
**Bryan.wagar**: This one right here?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Like, if you can.
**Bclymer**: If you can move that plan north and keep the transformer in the area where we have, like a good clearance.
**Bclymer**: I don't think anyone's going to have.
**Bryan.wagar**: An issue with putting the transformer here where my cursor is.
**Bschwartz**: Oh, no.
**Bclymer**: You want to move it there?
**Bclymer**: I thought you want to keep it by that control.
**Bryan.wagar**: No, no, no, no.
**Bryan.wagar**: I was just getting clarification if we can.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, because right now you guys had the transformer in this area, and the transformer won't be able to fit in this area at all.
**Bryan.wagar**: Which is why I was asking, maybe instead of it being right here, we just moved it kind of just diagonally about a meter or two just to right here.
**Bryan.wagar**: So that way it's still next to the power box.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I mean, there is a lot of room between that and whatever that component is on the left side.
**Cheryl.green**: Yeah.
**Cheryl.green**: That bump out equipment, whatever it is in white there.
**Cheryl.green**: What's your.
**Cheryl.green**: What's your distance between the.
**Bryan.wagar**: Between this.
**Cheryl.green**: Yeah, rough.
**Cheryl.green**: Rough.
**Cheryl.green**: Front edge of that transformer and the.
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah.
**Kevin.ly**: So this to here.
**Bryan.wagar**: I know that's not a straight line, but it tells me it at the bottom.
**Bryan.wagar**: So.
**Bryan.wagar**: 1.6 meters.
**Cheryl.green**: Sorry, I gotta convert that.
**Bryan.wagar**: I think that's around five feet.
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah.
**Cheryl.green**: Okay, we're good there.
**Cheryl.green**: We.
**Cheryl.green**: We need 42 inches in front of the panel, the transformer.
**Cheryl.green**: So.
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay, so then.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, so this would be.
**Bryan.wagar**: This would be fine then.
**Bryan.wagar**: Unless you see an issue, Joe.
**Bryan.wagar**: Otherwise, I think we can also just place the transformer right here.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, this looks.
**Bryan.wagar**: This looks.
**Bschwartz**: This looks better.
**Bryan.wagar**: All right, cool.
**Bryan.wagar**: So then.
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah, I.
**Bryan.wagar**: That was the main reason I just wanted to ask, because I know that you updated the drawing, but there are just some things that we weren't sure of.
**Bryan.wagar**: So I know that in this drawing you don't really have the power box locations, but I can go ahead and I can kind of like take a snippet of this and draw where those locations would be.
**Bryan.wagar**: Just so that way you kind of have an idea of where those transformers can go.
**Cheryl.green**: I've got your peripheral wiring layout that I'm marking up.
**Cheryl.green**: So I'll send that over to my designer.
**Cheryl.green**: I think we also need to double check that we've got the right backgrounds.
**Cheryl.green**: CAD backgrounds in there.
**Bryan.wagar**: So imagine what you guys are showing.
**Bryan.wagar**: If you have the peripheral wiring CAD drawing, then that already has the call outs that basically points at where those power boxes are going to be.
**Bryan.wagar**: So then you can just pull it right from there and that would.
**Bryan.wagar**: That would be it.
**Kevin.ly**: Yep.
**Kevin.ly**: Otherwise.
**Bryan.wagar**: Otherwise, then.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, that was.
**Bryan.wagar**: That was the only concern.
**Bryan.wagar**: I believe.
**Bryan.wagar**: We already approved the The KVAS on the transformers.
**Bryan.wagar**: So I think we're all aligned there.
**Bryan.wagar**: And I just wanted to make sure that we were good on the transformers.
**Bryan.wagar**: I think I can bring up.
**Bryan.wagar**: I don't know if it makes it easier or worse for you guys.
**Bryan.wagar**: We can make it work either way.
**Bryan.wagar**: But this transformer right here was for the inbound system.
**Bryan.wagar**: That was the csi.
**Bryan.wagar**: That power box is actually going to be right here where my mouse is.
**Bryan.wagar**: So I don't know if it's EAS for you to move that transformer to this column and have it sit right there.
**Bryan.wagar**: If it's harder, then we can make it work as is.
**Bryan.wagar**: But I figured that it might save you some cable distance if you wanted to.
**Cheryl.green**: Can you.
**Cheryl.green**: Can you let me share?
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah.
**Bryan.wagar**: Sorry.
**Cheryl.green**: Probably easier.
**Cheryl.green**: So you can just see what I'm marking up.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, no, you're good.
**Cheryl.green**: All right, so we've got transformer next to this one for CSO1.
**Kevin.ly**: Yep.
**Cheryl.green**: Next to here for CSO2.
**Kevin.ly**: Yep.
**Cheryl.green**: Here for CSO3.
**Bryan.wagar**: Perfect.
**Cheryl.green**: You're good with B1 and 8 or.
**Cheryl.green**: Sorry, A1 and B1 being right next to each.
**Cheryl.green**: To the transformers or the.
**Cheryl.green**: The panels, too.
**Kevin.ly**: Yep.
**Cheryl.green**: Okay.
**Cheryl.green**: And then move csi.
**Cheryl.green**: We could probably go right on this.
**Cheryl.green**: This column and you guys can just run around to the.
**Cheryl.green**: To the panel location.
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah, that would be good.
**Cheryl.green**: And then we've got.
**Cheryl.green**: I think we've got.
**Bryan.wagar**: We got one right there.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah.
**Bryan.wagar**: In that area.
**Bryan.wagar**: If you can kind of.
**Bryan.wagar**: If you can perfectly center it between the two, that would be preferred because we do need to leave some sort of clearance to the end of those blue lines.
**Bryan.wagar**: But otherwise.
**Bryan.wagar**: Right in that area is what we agreed on.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah.
**Kevin.ly**: So.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, so that would be.
**Kevin.ly**: That would be preferred.
**Bryan.wagar**: I don't know if this impacts much for you guys, but at least this marks.
**Bryan.wagar**: This has been what we've been talking about.
**Bryan.wagar**: So we're kind of aligned here.
**Cheryl.green**: Okay.
**Cheryl.green**: From a.
**Cheryl.green**: From an electrical perspective, I think slightly longer on the.
**Cheryl.green**: The feeders, moving them from, you know, up here to down here.
**Cheryl.green**: But ultimately we were trying to save some feeder length by moving them back.
**Cheryl.green**: This shift will save some feeder length too, since we were coming from.
**Cheryl.green**: Let me go back to this view.
**Cheryl.green**: Yeah, we're shifting this one over here.
**Cheryl.green**: We'll save some feeder length.
**Cheryl.green**: The biggest impact still is just moving that CS CSF3 from what was back here to the front end.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah.
**Bryan.wagar**: Well, then I think we're aligned.
**Bryan.wagar**: I don't know if you still need.
**Bryan.wagar**: I mean, I'm getting.
**Bryan.wagar**: This is verbal approval and everything for me, saying that the Ones that you just marked are good, but if you need to send over another drawing and get like a double approval, then I can go ahead and approve that whenever you send another drawing.
**Cheryl.green**: I think we're good from this point, Ahmed, unless you want us to do one last round, I think it's fine.
**Bclymer**: And just so you know, Brian, the latest backgrounds include the conveyor system that we received.
**Bclymer**: So you should try to incorporate that which it shows.
**Bclymer**: All the control panels.
**Bclymer**: I do see them now.
**Cheryl.green**: Okay.
**Cheryl.green**: Yeah, I'll get with my BIM team.
**Cheryl.green**: I thought we had already gotten those updated, but they just sent them with.
**Bclymer**: The IFC bulletin progress background.
**Bclymer**: So they were just incorporated.
**Bschwartz**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Joe and Cody, any And Brian, anything else electrically that we need to go over here or.
**Bclymer**: Or is this the final stretch when it comes to the electrical portion?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I have one concern, that there's no, like, objects.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Like, it won't be object to the operation point of view.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Right.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: For the location of the transformer or the panel location.
**Bclymer**: I would not know how to answer that one.
**Bclymer**: Cody.
**Bclymer**: Joe.
**Bclymer**: Cody, do you know that video?
**Bschwartz**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Do you want to pull it right back up, Cody, and just show where people will actually be standing and stuff?
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah, yeah.
**Kevin.ly**: So all of.
**Bryan.wagar**: So I can.
**Bryan.wagar**: I can go power box by power box here.
**Bryan.wagar**: Because all the transformers are going to be next to the power boxes.
**Bryan.wagar**: The power box right here in this area.
**Bryan.wagar**: You're never going to have anyone farther north than this area right here.
**Bryan.wagar**: So that power box and transformer location won't be an issue.
**Bryan.wagar**: Same thing on the right side.
**Bryan.wagar**: Because the layouts are basically mirrored in that sense.
**Bryan.wagar**: When you come over to this side, the transformer won't be close.
**Bryan.wagar**: The only reason you would need to kind of come in this general area would be to refill the.
**Bryan.wagar**: The label machine and to refill the erector with more cardboard boxes.
**Bryan.wagar**: So you'll be getting like, kind of close to it.
**Bryan.wagar**: But I believe it was Brian that said that we've hit the appropriate clearance between these two machines, so that shouldn't be an issue either.
**Bryan.wagar**: And then the other two power boxes on the outbound side, the ones that are over here, those are never going to be accessed by any Uniqlo operators.
**Bryan.wagar**: That's going to be specifically for exotect maintenance purposes.
**Bryan.wagar**: And then on the north side, the same thing comes for over here.
**Bryan.wagar**: This area should only really be for exotech maintenance purposes.
**Bryan.wagar**: So any Uniqlo employees should never really go any farther than about here and about here.
**Cheryl.green**: Cody, should we.
**Cheryl.green**: Oh, shoot.
**Cheryl.green**: I don't think we can do that.
**Cheryl.green**: I was gonna.
**Cheryl.green**: I was gonna say, should we flip the tra.
**Cheryl.green**: That transformer to the south side of those columns?
**Bryan.wagar**: This one right here?
**Cheryl.green**: Yeah.
**Cheryl.green**: My.
**Cheryl.green**: My issue there is that we won't meet any C clearances if we put it on the south side.
**Kevin.ly**: So this won't work here.
**Bryan.wagar**: But you're saying it's also not going to work here.
**Cheryl.green**: No, that was my question to you, was if we put it on the north side, is someone going to be working on the ends of those two conveyors that would have.
**Jdawson**: So this.
**Jdawson**: This is a reject.
**Jdawson**: This is a.
**Jdawson**: Not a fully manned area at all times.
**Jdawson**: This is more once a tote.
**Jdawson**: This is where the RFID tunnel actually is.
**Jdawson**: So if a tote gets misread or doesn't have the right amount of items in it, it will eject to this little conveyor right here to where a light will come on that says, hey, somebody needs to come and look at this.
**Jdawson**: I mean, it's.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah.
**Bryan.wagar**: And.
**Bryan.wagar**: And that main point of action would realistically be.
**Bryan.wagar**: Somebody would walk over here.
**Bryan.wagar**: They would probably stand about right here.
**Bryan.wagar**: You can kind of see it.
**Bryan.wagar**: I can zoom in a little bit more.
**Bryan.wagar**: It says operator screen right here.
**Bryan.wagar**: So there would be a screen, maybe somebody standing in this area, roughly, but they would never really come around to this side.
**Bryan.wagar**: It would really just be like, interaction on this area right here.
**Cheryl.green**: Are you comfortable with that?
**Cheryl.green**: With that transformer still sitting on the north side of those columns?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: If no big issue to the operation point of view.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I don't have any.
**Jdawson**: I mean, what is the issue?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: It's okay.
**Jdawson**: North or south side.
**Cheryl.green**: The issue being on the south side isn't.
**Cheryl.green**: Is maintaining any C clearances, because I have to have 42 inches in front of that transformer.
**Bclymer**: Cody, is there any way the control panel gets flipped on the other side of the expansion joint, and then we place our transformer where this control panel is.
**Bryan.wagar**: Is there a reason why we couldn't just put the transformer here then instead.
**Bclymer**: Same thing on that side, too.
**Mparsons**: We could.
**Cheryl.green**: It's a little tighter on that side.
**Cheryl.green**: What's up?
**Bclymer**: I'm saying to the corner of the.
**Bclymer**: Of the column, like, move.
**Bclymer**: Move your square a little bit up to the first column.
**Bclymer**: The first flange.
**Kevin.ly**: Like here.
**Kevin.ly**: Ish.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, Like.
**Bryan.wagar**: But.
**Bclymer**: But a little bit, like beyond the column grid.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Kevin.ly**: Right here.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: Tight to the column.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah.
**Bryan.wagar**: If you guys.
**Bryan.wagar**: If you guys want to put the transformer here.
**Kevin.ly**: That's good.
**Bryan.wagar**: Unless you're talking about the power box.
**Bryan.wagar**: Sorry.
**Bclymer**: Can you place a block and just see the distance between whatever that white block you have on the left side.
**Bclymer**: Just.
**Bclymer**: I'm not sure what that is.
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah, let me grab the building column that I placed.
**Bryan.wagar**: Not the building column, the.
**Bryan.wagar**: The transformer that I drew down here.
**Kevin.ly**: That a little bit easier about to.
**Bclymer**: Say, Cody, you added a compliment.
**Bryan.wagar**: No, no, no, no, no.
**Bryan.wagar**: Not a column.
**Kevin.ly**: You want about right here.
**Jdawson**: Now snug it, snug it to the column.
**Bclymer**: Closer to the column.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, like this.
**Bclymer**: Like a writing.
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And you can go a little bit plan north too, if you need.
**Bclymer**: But up to the line.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Right there.
**Bclymer**: This way you still have clearance from like the conveyor.
**Bclymer**: And then you should have more than 42 inches of that next block that you have on the left side.
**Bryan.wagar**: The one on the list.
**Bryan.wagar**: This way?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, that.
**Bclymer**: That white block right there where your mouse was.
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah.
**Kevin.ly**: Yep.
**Bryan.wagar**: From here to here, we're looking at 1.8 meters, which is larger than what.
**Kevin.ly**: We had at the bottom.
**Bryan.wagar**: So that should be good.
**Bclymer**: And then what do you have to the conveyor?
**Kevin.ly**: The closest conveyor would be this one south, which we're looking at 1.11 meters.
**Cheryl.green**: That's fine.
**Cheryl.green**: The 42 inches is only in one direction.
**Cheryl.green**: It's whichever, whatever.
**Bryan.wagar**: Whichever way you just turn it.
**Cheryl.green**: Yeah, it's.
**Cheryl.green**: It's.
**Cheryl.green**: The front face of the transformer needs 42 inches.
**Cheryl.green**: The other three sides are like 8 to 8 to 10 inches just for air.
**Cheryl.green**: Air movement.
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay, so then, yeah, if.
**Bryan.wagar**: If you guys are cool with the transformer right here and I guess facing it this way would be the best case scenario for you guys, then that works with us.
**Bclymer**: You see, guys, this better.
**Bclymer**: This way that if someone is in front of those belts, we don't have an issue.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah, way better, I guess.
**Bclymer**: Okay, I'm sorry, Cody, continue.
**Kevin.ly**: No, you're good.
**Bryan.wagar**: I think, I think that was the last one that we really had to cover because the only.
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah, the other power boxes, there's.
**Bryan.wagar**: Oh yeah, the transformers here.
**Bryan.wagar**: And I can go ahead and grab.
**Kevin.ly**: That block just in case we need that.
**Bryan.wagar**: Again, these transformers in this area would be placed kind of just like similar to that.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, basically just like that.
**Bryan.wagar**: The operators are going to be in those yellow hatched areas, so.
**Bryan.wagar**: Oh, where did that just go?
**Bryan.wagar**: Your operators would be in this yellow hatch area right here and right over here.
**Bryan.wagar**: So you're.
**Bryan.wagar**: They're not directly in the range of the transformer.
**Bryan.wagar**: And if you have the transformer facing north, then in that case you're going to have that clearance for sure.
**Bclymer**: What's the sequence of installation?
**Bclymer**: I'm Assuming the transformers are going to be installed prior to those components that we're trying to maintain a center line to.
**Cheryl.green**: Most.
**Cheryl.green**: I guess that's a question.
**Cheryl.green**: Question for Aliato.
**Cheryl.green**: But typically, I mean, the.
**Cheryl.green**: They will install that transformer and drop the power to it probably before exitec gets around to installing some of that stuff, Correct?
**Cheryl.green**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So that's definitely gonna have to be placed very precisely if we're gonna butt up to some of these fences like that.
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah.
**Bryan.wagar**: And if we're going to do that, I can.
**Bryan.wagar**: I can end up sending.
**Bryan.wagar**: I can end up creating some drawings and sending that over and I can use one of the columns as a reference and just say, hey, this far down, this far over and work with you guys on that just to make sure that this does get placed properly.
**Bclymer**: I'm going to go even further.
**Bclymer**: Joe, you said that there's going to be some sort of like that machine that basically draws the racks onto the slab, right?
**Jdawson**: Correct.
**Bclymer**: Is there any way we can add the.
**Bclymer**: These little squares so then we know that these are transformer allocated transformer locations?
**Bclymer**: That is.
**Aelkarrimy**: I know it's a big ask.
**Bclymer**: I'm throwing it out there.
**Bschwartz**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jdawson**: And.
**Jdawson**: And that's the other thing.
**Jdawson**: What, what it draws out is it draws out basically all the.
**Jdawson**: The holes that need to be drilled for the racking.
**Bclymer**: So it was.
**Bclymer**: It's an idea.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Well, I mean, here's the thing.
**Jdawson**: I'm looking, I am looking at the schedule here.
**Jdawson**: I'm looking at the Aliada schedule.
**Jdawson**: They don't have this being installed until around August.
**Jdawson**: I want to say.
**Kevin.ly**: I'm trying to find.
**Jdawson**: There it is.
**Jdawson**: It says new feeders, install new panels.
**Jdawson**: I'm going to install feeders to transformer locations.
**Jdawson**: Plan b that starts August 15th.
**Jdawson**: So by then everything will be, you know, will be drawn on the ground.
**Jdawson**: I just.
**Jdawson**: The robots, I.
**Jdawson**: I think they only draw the X's where the feet go.
**Jdawson**: They're not.
**Jdawson**: They're not necessarily going to draw the.
**Jdawson**: The fence line.
**Bclymer**: Noted, noted.
**Cheryl.green**: It.
**Bclymer**: It was a thought.
**Bclymer**: But yes, we could do the coordinated thing through the columns too, Cody, for sure.
**Cheryl.green**: Ahmed.
**Cheryl.green**: One other thing that we've done, and this would be a question for Aliato, is we've had them run the overhead feeders and then coil them up up high and not connect them and wait for Exotek in this instance to get some of the.
**Cheryl.green**: Their equipment in place and then they can set those transformers.
**Cheryl.green**: That's obviously different than what construction schedule currently says, but that would be a potential option to help further Ensure that we're fully coordinated on where those transformers sit versus the fencing and equipment from Exotech.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Or yeah, I think that's a good idea too, Kevo.
**Bclymer**: We'll let you guys kind of manage this process because we just don't want to have to relocate all of that equipment and have to take things apart.
**Bclymer**: I think it would be.
**Bclymer**: We need to be strategic.
**Bclymer**: Either accommodating what Brian just said, I think is also excellent, or just keeping them not mounted to the floor so that we can move them accordingly prior to finally firing them up.
**Bschwartz**: Okay.
**Daisuke.mine**: Hey, Brian, can you put this in a.
**Daisuke.mine**: Or put that in an email to me and Kevla and that way we're all on the same page and will stay in touch about it.
**Cheryl.green**: The solution I just proposed.
**Daisuke.mine**: Yes.
**Cheryl.green**: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Cheryl.green**: I'll send an email.
**Daisuke.mine**: Appreciate it.
**Bclymer**: Yusuke, do you want to go over anything specific at this time?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I'm not sure it's appropriate to talk in here, but those kind of change, change, design change, how it affected a cost, and who is taking responsibility for this cost.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And we're not like it's not on us, in my understanding.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So just to make.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Want to make sure, let's separately with Joe Ahmed maybe.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, let's.
**Bclymer**: Let's just wait.
**Bclymer**: Let's just gather the change order first just to understand the magnitude.
**Bclymer**: Maybe there's some like.
**Bclymer**: We know there's going to be some change order with regards to the KVA increases and whatnot.
**Bclymer**: Hopefully the cabling.
**Bclymer**: Maybe Aliata is going to take care of us on something.
**Bclymer**: We don't know yet, but we'll leave that up to Kevin, Mike and the Aliato team.
**Bclymer**: But let's just wait for the change order to come in and then you, myself and Joe will hop on a call and just discuss internally.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So it depends on what Aliato brings us.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: We cannot like accommodate the changes, right?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: We have to think again.
**Bclymer**: Well, no, we have to accommodate the changes, but it's a big conversation we need to have.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: At this moment, Yuzuka, the bigger boxes are needed in order to accommodate the equipment.
**Jdawson**: So I mean, that.
**Jdawson**: That is a must.
**Jdawson**: The system will not work without it.
**Jdawson**: But based on what the changes that were moved around right now, I mean, it doesn't sound like we're adding.
**Jdawson**: We're actually shortening some cabling lengths is what it's sounding like to me.
**Jdawson**: But we do.
**Jdawson**: We do still need to wait for the.
**Jdawson**: That change order to come in from Aliato.
**Jdawson**: I mean, it is.
**Jdawson**: It is a given.
**Jdawson**: It is needed, needed but it's just there the initial quote was based on a sales estimate and you know, after finishing the electrical power requirements, it did need to be.
**Jdawson**: We did need to make a couple of them larger.
**Jdawson**: So Kiva, who.
**Jdawson**: Who's in charge of putting that together right now?
**Bschwartz**: We are.
**Bschwartz**: Well, we were waiting for these drawings to be finalized and then now our electrician is going to give us a number for what is.
**Bschwartz**: What is changing and what is going down on what is going up.
**Bschwartz**: And when that gets to us, we will send it over and I guess we can discuss after we receive that.
**Bschwartz**: So we are looking to have those numbers by next week so we can discuss them.
**Cheryl.green**: Right.
**Jdawson**: And Dean did say the feeders do need to increase in size.
**Cheryl.green**: The one line diagram I sent out this morning.
**Cheryl.green**: Yes, this morning includes the transformer upsizes and the associated feeders for those transformers.
**Cheryl.green**: So.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Right, Fine.
**Bschwartz**: Okay.
**Bschwartz**: Anything else, Suzuki?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Cheryl.green**: Go ahead.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I think it's okay.
**Kevin.ly**: But.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Evan, do you have any like anything you want to know?
**Kevin.ly**: No, I think I understand.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah.
**Bschwartz**: You.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: You want.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: You have something or you're good?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Maybe we can talk separately with Joe regarding the.
**Bclymer**: I mean let's.
**Bclymer**: Let's.
**Bclymer**: Let's hang back.
**Bclymer**: Joe and Jisuke and Uniqlo folks and fast retail.
**Bclymer**: If we can just hang back after this call.
**Bclymer**: But let's.
**Bclymer**: Let's let the team go for now.
**Bclymer**: And then Cabo, whenever you get the change order, please do send that over just so then we can have our discussion internally and then we'll.
**Bclymer**: We'll come right back to you guys.
**Bschwartz**: Sounds good.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Bschwartz**: Okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And one more thing for the daily report, are you guys issuing to us or right now you don't have any work so you're not issuing.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Like I'm not sure how that goes.
**Bschwartz**: So do you still want daily reports?
**Bschwartz**: I thought the last time we concluded that we will be sending out weekly reports that summarize everything we are doing and then what is possibly coming in the weeks to follow.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: If you're working, we want to receive the daily report.
**Daisuke.mine**: And yes, Yusuke, those daily go are going to be through job planner and I'll make sure that I get those.
**Daisuke.mine**: Those contacts added.
**Daisuke.mine**: But yeah, you're not added yet, right?
**Daisuke.mine**: Yes.
**Daisuke.mine**: And yeah, and you're right.
**Daisuke.mine**: Okay.
**Daisuke.mine**: Yeah.
**Daisuke.mine**: And like you said, we haven't had any work going on, so yeah, they haven't been updated.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay, I understand.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So please add our Uniqlo team member.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Did they daily for job planning or something?
**Bschwartz**: Okay.
**Bschwartz**: Yeah, I'll make sure.
**Bschwartz**: You guys, I think I did add You.
**Bschwartz**: I'll make sure I sent you.
**Bschwartz**: I send you a link if you are not already signed up.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: The link you send it me.
**Bclymer**: You're going to invite Yusuke for you to create the account on Job Planner.
**Bclymer**: So you'll get an invite through email and then you have to click the link and then start your account.
**Bschwartz**: Okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I don't remember what's the what job?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I can search in Job Planner.
**Bschwartz**: Yeah, I, I, I'm going to resend you the link if you didn't have it.
**Bschwartz**: But I can, I can resend it so you can, you can sign up here.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I cannot see any Job Planner in my email.
**Bschwartz**: Okay, I will want to send it again right now.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay, thank you.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I'll confirm it.
**Bschwartz**: All right.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Other than that, I don't have any.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Anything now.
**Mparsons**: Hey, is.
**Cheryl.green**: Okay.
**Cheryl.green**: This is Brian.
**Cheryl.green**: Did we get any word back from the the other tenant in the building on those panel locations next to the offices?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay, okay.
**Mparsons**: To.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: To keep the original design, right?
**Cheryl.green**: Yes.
**Bschwartz**: So give me a second.
**Bclymer**: That didn't get back to me so good.
**Bschwartz**: No.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah, me too.
**Bclymer**: He said, he called me twice.
**Bclymer**: He said he's going to get back to me later on and then he never called back.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Hey, who the Ted.
**Bclymer**: You said Ted Chesky.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I didn't receive any message from Ted yet, so I think he haven't received yet.
**Bclymer**: I'll call him in the morning since it's after hours now.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay, I'll talk internally.
**Cheryl.green**: Ahmed, since we don't have direction on that, are we going to push bulletin one until we get that information?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, let's just wait till we get confirmation for now.
**Bclymer**: Like we'll maintain the date that's already on the title blocks that everyone has, just so then we don't have to recirculate a new one.
**Bclymer**: And then we'll, we'll.
**Bclymer**: Once we have a direction, I'll let you.
**Bclymer**: Brian, let me know how long you guys need just to either shift things or if we're okay and we're keeping things as is.
**Bclymer**: How long do you guys need to distribute?
**Bclymer**: And I think Aaron, you're, you're good to go with your updates for 6 12.
**Bclymer**: So I don't think there's any changes currently for you.
**Erinm**: Yeah, and it's, it's ready on our side, so if you want it tomorrow, we can send it your way.
**Bclymer**: Send it over.
**Bclymer**: I have mine as well ready.
**Bclymer**: So I'll have that on the side.
**Bclymer**: And then we'll wait for just Henderson's drawings and then we'll issue everything next week when they give us the go ahead.
**Cheryl.green**: That works.
**Cheryl.green**: Thanks, Ahmed.
**Erinm**: Sounds good.
**Erinm**: Thank you.
**Bclymer**: Thank you.
**Bclymer**: I think we're good to conclude.
**Bclymer**: You see, I'll hang back with Brian and Joe and the rest of the Uniqlo team.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Is it okay to keep here, like, stay here, or.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah, we can stay here.
**Bschwartz**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: It won't end if we.
**Bclymer**: Unless we end the call.
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah.
**Bschwartz**: Thank you, guys.
**Cheryl.green**: Thanks, Kevin.
**Cheryl.green**: Ahmed, did you want me to stick back to you or you want me to drop?
**Kevin.ly**: If.
**Bclymer**: If you can just think.
**Bclymer**: Just so then we can go through suitcase concerns.
**Bclymer**: Because I think this is going to be a good conversation that we have to have now.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I can see the Firefly stays, though.
