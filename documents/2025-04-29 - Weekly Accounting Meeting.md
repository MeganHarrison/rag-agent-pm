**Fnjie**: So I.
**Bclymer**: Let's wait for him to connect still.
**Bclymer**: We still have some time just to start the meeting.
**Bclymer**: But just so you know, this is just something to talk about what's missing.
**Accounting**: Okay?
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Accounting**: Sounds good.
**Accounting**: Thank you.
**Jdawson**: Morning, Fatima.
**Jdawson**: Morning, Fritzi.
**Jdawson**: How you doing?
**Accounting**: Good.
**Accounting**: How are you?
**Jdawson**: Great.
**Jdawson**: Brandon had a call with the owner after the meeting.
**Jdawson**: We just left, so.
**Accounting**: Oh, okay.
**Jdawson**: Finishing that up before he gets on here.
**Accounting**: Yeah, not a problem.
**Jdawson**: I just texted Brandon.
**Jdawson**: See where he's at.
**Jdawson**: Or he's getting on here.
**Bclymer**: Brandon will join soon, guys.
**Bclymer**: So he said he will join soon.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Accounting**: Thank you.
**Jdawson**: He said what?
**Bclymer**: Jesse?
**Bclymer**: Brandon said he's finishing a meeting.
**Bclymer**: He will join right now.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Soon.
**Bclymer**: Sorry, let me check with Brandon again.
**Bclymer**: In the meantime, Fatima, is there something that you need from Brandon?
**Bclymer**: From me, from Jesse or anything?
**Bclymer**: So he's still in the meeting?
**Bclymer**: He said he's finishing right now.
**Bclymer**: But still taking him is taking him time.
**Accounting**: No, I don't need anything.
**Accounting**: I'm.
**Accounting**: I mean, I've just been working through the audit.
**Accounting**: Unless the team needs anything.
**Accounting**: Jose and Fritzy, are you guys good?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we're good.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I had a question like an email this morning on the billing.
**Jdawson**: It's like a.
**Jdawson**: For superior on the goodwill job.
**Jdawson**: What's the easiest way to get.
**Jdawson**: Get them paid because it's such a small amount.
**Jdawson**: I'd hate to have to do two billings, but.
**Fnjie**: Yeah.
**Fnjie**: Fatima, what happened is I checked that superior billing.
**Fnjie**: It's the change order.
**Fnjie**: There was a change order made which is.
**Fnjie**: It was not added in the total revised contract.
**Fnjie**: So.
**Accounting**: Okay, so was.
**Accounting**: Has the billing been issued in.
**Accounting**: In Procol?
**Accounting**: Has the bill been issued in pro form?
**Fnjie**: No.
**Fnjie**: Maybe I can share my screen?
**Accounting**: Yes, please.
**Fnjie**: So are you seeing my screen?
**Accounting**: Yes.
**Fnjie**: So this is the commitment that we are talking about.
**Fnjie**: So currently we have this total contract which is 286.
**Fnjie**: And we have already settled this amount as well.
**Fnjie**: But if you're going to go here, there is an approved change order which is 426.
**Fnjie**: This is matching as well on the invoice that they sent us.
**Fnjie**: The vendor sent us.
**Fnjie**: So it's just that the status here is ready to send and it's not added here.
**Fnjie**: Usually if there is a change order and once it's approved, it usually added in the total revised contract.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Accounting**: Do you think it will be added after it's sent?
**Fnjie**: I am not.
**Accounting**: Because it says ready.
**Accounting**: It says ready to send.
**Accounting**: I think once it's sent it will be added.
**Accounting**: So Jesse, do you.
**Accounting**: Do you want us to just.
**Accounting**: I mean, are you just wanting us to just manually input an invoice in acumatica and pay it?
**Jdawson**: Well, if that.
**Jdawson**: You know, if it.
**Jdawson**: I don't like when we go later on to.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, this job gets looked at.
**Jdawson**: Is this going to show as always open.
**Jdawson**: I mean I would like just to close it out.
**Jdawson**: If we need to do a billing and retainage billing and cut them a check that way, I'll do it, but.
**Jdawson**: Okay, Nick will do it.
**Jdawson**: But whatever.
**Accounting**: Right, right now where it says ready to send, we just need to send it.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: There is no pending if you're going here in erp like ERP integration.
**Fnjie**: I am.
**Fnjie**: It's a change order.
**Fnjie**: So I don't see there's a fail or something.
**Accounting**: Go back, go back to the first page you were on.
**Fnjie**: With a.
**Fnjie**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: Where it says.
**Accounting**: It said ready to send.
**Fnjie**: But if we're going to look at here, it seems like the revised contract is added.
**Fnjie**: I think we just need to prepare an invoice for that so that you can appear.
**Accounting**: Go back to the original page you were on that had the amount.
**Fnjie**: This.
**Fnjie**: So this is the change order.
**Accounting**: Yes.
**Accounting**: So there's a change order.
**Accounting**: So that's the amount we need to.
**Accounting**: We need to pay them.
**Fnjie**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: Is there.
**Accounting**: And when you go to invoices, is it there?
**Accounting**: It's not there yet, right?
**Fnjie**: It's not there.
**Accounting**: Okay, go back to the change orders.
**Accounting**: Click on the one that says ready to send.
**Accounting**: Total amount 426.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Accounting**: So Jesse, the.
**Accounting**: We you guys just need to.
**Accounting**: To invoice them or they need to invoice US for this $426 because the change order is already there.
**Accounting**: It's been approved.
**Accounting**: We just need the invoice and then.
**Jdawson**: We can pay a billing through procore.
**Jdawson**: Is there one open?
**Accounting**: I don't think there's a billing open for.
**Accounting**: Can you go to the invoice.
**Fnjie**: 100%.
**Fnjie**: We have already paid 286.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Accounting**: But the.
**Accounting**: The contract amount was increased from 286.
**Justin**: Right.
**Accounting**: It added the.
**Accounting**: Yes, the 400.
**Fnjie**: 400.
**Fnjie**: Yes.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Accounting**: Now.
**Accounting**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: So.
**Accounting**: So Jesse, we are retainage.
**Accounting**: Looks like retaining was already released on here.
**Accounting**: Click on where it says retainage because it still says ready to send.
**Accounting**: Click on where it says retainage.
**Jdawson**: I mean, it's like is this kind of will for this particular invoice, does he have to do two billings, one for the amount and then one for the retainage?
**Jdawson**: Or can it be combined and just pay the whole thing?
**Jdawson**: Or you can make it so it doesn't hold any retainage.
**Accounting**: It has to be to avoid, you know, complications with Acumatica.
**Accounting**: Two separate billings.
**Accounting**: Issue the additional billing first and then issue another invoice for the retainage because if not, we'll get a message from Acumatica saying there's not enough money held, there's not enough retainage.
**Jdawson**: And can I just go into Procor and approve the billing and the retainage billing?
**Accounting**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: So they don't have to fill anything out and then we can just issue payment.
**Accounting**: Yes, approve the billing first and then the retainage.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so I'm, I'm in.
**Accounting**: Sorry, go ahead.
**Jdawson**: So if I'm in invoicing.
**Accounting**: So I think first, first step is invoice for that $486 extra that change.
**Jdawson**: Are there any other subs that aren't completely paid out on this job?
**Fnjie**: We have here, but I will double check this one.
**Fnjie**: Yeah, maybe we will be checking the subs because some of the payment from Akumatica is not syncing from Procore and then some of the retinage as well is not properly applying the invoice amount or in the payment.
**Fnjie**: It's not properly reflecting the correct amount.
**Fnjie**: So that we need to check as well.
**Bclymer**: We will.
**Fnjie**: Maybe we'll be checking each subcon or each vendor and match with a payment made in Informatica.
**Jmendez**: Sorry I was late, guys.
**Accounting**: Hello.
**Accounting**: So Fritzi, use.
**Accounting**: Use this list, go into Akumatica and then note on each item the amount paid.
**Accounting**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: And then compare it back to this.
**Fnjie**: Yeah, yeah, sure.
**Accounting**: So Jesse, you good on that?
**Accounting**: That invoice?
**Jdawson**: Okay, so I go in here and I'm creating in the billing period or can this be billed under the 4 1?
**Accounting**: Do you want to share your screen?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So I would just click on this one here and fill it out.
**Accounting**: Yes.
**Accounting**: But what is the end commitments?
**Jdawson**: Honestly, I don't know how to do it.
**Jdawson**: I don't know how to do their billing for them.
**Jmendez**: So.
**Jmendez**: So in that.
**Jmendez**: So what you're, what you're trying to do is you're trying to delete that bill right there, that top one.
**Jdawson**: Well, I want to fill it out because we got to do.
**Jdawson**: So they had A small change order when that wall, the roof train leaked.
**Jmendez**: That's fine.

**Jmendez**: So go.
**Jmendez**: Scroll up to the top.
**Jmendez**: Press exit, beta, reload.

**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jmendez**: So then, you know, you can put in.
**Justin**: So.
**Jmendez**: So now you press edit again, top right.
**Jmendez**: And then so underneath this period column E, you can put in whatever you want them to be.
**Jmendez**: Billing for.
**Jmendez**: E to the left.
**Jmendez**: There you go.
**Justin**: That.
**Jdawson**: This one here?
**Jmendez**: No, no, not that one.
**Jmendez**: There you go.
**Justin**: Yep.
**Accounting**: And can you change the date to 2025?
**Accounting**: We've already updated the WIP and submit it to auditors for 2024.
**Jdawson**: Where is that at?
**Accounting**: I think it's in the summary.
**Jmendez**: Press, press.
**Accounting**: Save first.
**Jdawson**: Save this first.
**Justin**: Update.
**Justin**: Yes.
**Jmendez**: So this is a retainage billing.
**Jdawson**: Well, this is a billing for the change order.
**Jdawson**: And then they got to do another one for the retainer.
**Jmendez**: Change that to whatever billing this will be.
**Jmendez**: So 007.
**Jmendez**: And then make sure you update your period end to be 4, 30, 25.
**Jmendez**: You can update.
**Jmendez**: Hold on a second.
**Jmendez**: Scroll to the top.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Jmendez**: All right, so now you can.
**Jmendez**: You can go back, mark it approved and export it.
**Jdawson**: Just resend it.
**Jdawson**: The ERP.
**Justin**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: I do one more for $42.
**Jmendez**: Well, that's the.
**Jmendez**: That's $42 is the retainage.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jmendez**: I mean, this.
**Jmendez**: This pay app right here shows total earned, less retained retainage.
**Jmendez**: So that's it.
**Jmendez**: Just store.
**Jmendez**: Just the 42 is all we're holding, it looks like.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jmendez**: Then yeah, you do another one for the retainage amount.
**Jmendez**: You got to wait till that sinks, though, and then you probably want to do another billing period for May.
**Jmendez**: That way it's clean.
**Jdawson**: Okay, but they can just pay it all at once.
**Jmendez**: Correct.
**Jmendez**: They can go in because they're going to have to go in and manually do release the retainers in acumatica.
**Jmendez**: So they'll kind of check that has the what are 400 something and then 42.
**Jmendez**: It'll be two line items.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: All right, I will do that after our meeting.
**Jdawson**: And I can create that retainage billing.
**Jdawson**: That isn't something accounting has to do, correct?
**Jmendez**: Yeah, you'll just go back to invoices at the top left and then go to the right side, press create, and then create invoice.
**Jmendez**: And then the only thing you'll need to do is you'll need to go to a new billing period, it looks like, because I don't think you have May created yet.
**Jmendez**: Period.
**Fnjie**: End.
**Jmendez**: You want to put it at the end of May.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jmendez**: It's like teaching a baby to walk.
**Justin**: I know.
**Jmendez**: All right, and then go to the far right.
**Jmendez**: So I hate this view Materials probably sort of.
**Jmendez**: There should be an area where it says release retainage.
**Jmendez**: So okay, press submit.
**Jmendez**: Just press submit.
**Jmendez**: Bottom right.
**Jmendez**: Yep, there you go.
**Jmendez**: All right, and then so there's the invoice.
**Jmendez**: So on the, on the right, where it says release retainage on all items, Click type in 100% and then press release.
**Jmendez**: And then now go back to your summary page.
**Jmendez**: It should say scroll down, 42 bucks.
**Jmendez**: Boom, done.
**Jmendez**: All right, now just mark it as approved.
**Jmendez**: Good to go.
**Jmendez**: And then I don't think we export these right, guys, because don't press ERP because it's not syncing.
**Jmendez**: Right.
**Jmendez**: You guys just have to manually go in and do it.
**Jmendez**: Yes.
**Jmendez**: No, Maybe.
**Jmendez**: Hello, Accounting?
**Jmendez**: Jose somebody.
**Accounting**: Hey, I'm.
**Accounting**: I'm here.
**Accounting**: Sorry, I didn't hear you.
**Jmendez**: What was that said we do we export this to ERP or.
**Jmendez**: No, because it's a retainers building.
**Jmendez**: Those don't sync.
**Accounting**: Actually, they do.
**Accounting**: You export to erp.
**Jmendez**: Okay, so all right.
**Jmendez**: Export it.
**Accounting**: Yeah.
**Jmendez**: Okay.
**Accounting**: The other one has synced though, right?
**Accounting**: The last invoice.
**Jmendez**: Yeah.
**Jmendez**: So Jose, make sure you go in and cut the check for these.
**Jmendez**: And it should be one check with both of them on it.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we'll do.
**Jmendez**: Click on invoices, top left.
**Jmendez**: Jesse.
**Jdawson**: Failed.
**Jmendez**: Number seven failed.
**Accounting**: Yeah, number seven failed.
**Accounting**: What does it say?
**Accounting**: Not enough retainage held.
**Accounting**: But that's not a retainage invoice.
**Accounting**: That's just a.
**Accounting**: That's just a change order.
**Fnjie**: Okay, Jose, invoice 7 is 29,000.
**Fnjie**: I think it should only be 400 something, right?
**Accounting**: I think that's what he made it.
**Accounting**: The 426.
**Jdawson**: It's 426.
**Fnjie**: That's the written edge of the change order.
**Fnjie**: But if you can see the invoice number seven, total amount payment.
**Jmendez**: It says payment due of 29,000.
**Jmendez**: So that looks incorrect.
**Accounting**: Oh, okay.
**Fnjie**: Yeah.
**Jmendez**: So you'll.
**Jmendez**: Yeah.
**Jmendez**: Why would it say that?
**Jmendez**: So, Jose, what.
**Jmendez**: Why don't you jump in here and you know what needs to be done now and get these updated so that it's correct.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jmendez**: All right, sounds good.
**Jdawson**: All right, thank you.
**Jmendez**: Cool.
**Jmendez**: Anything else that I need to.
**Jmendez**: Questions for me or anything I need to be brought up to speed on?
**Accounting**: I think we just need the credit cards coded.
**Accounting**: The Chase credit card.
**Jmendez**: Send me the Chase credit card thing.
**Jmendez**: I'll do it real quick.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Accounting**: I saw the message from the auditors yesterday.
**Accounting**: I.
**Accounting**: I've up.
**Accounting**: I uploaded the Whip right after we spoke, so I don't even know if they check in everything.
**Accounting**: Most of what they asked for is in there, but I'll send them another email just to see if I missed anything.
**Jmendez**: Okay.
**Jmendez**: And I responded to him last night about all that IT Stuff, like any of that matters.
**Accounting**: So, yeah, everything is there.
**Accounting**: They keep saying the bank wrecks don't tie, but they.
**Accounting**: They do from what I'm seeing.
**Accounting**: So maybe we can review all that in a meeting, but as far as I know, I don't think I owe them anything, but maybe I'm missing something.
**Justin**: All right, sounds good.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Jmendez**: All right, see you guys.
**Accounting**: All right, thank you.
