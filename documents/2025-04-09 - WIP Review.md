## Transcript
**Jdawson**: SA.
**Speaker 1**: Morning, Fatima.
**Jdawson**: Good morning, Jesse.
**Jdawson**: How are you?
**Speaker 1**: I'm good.
**Speaker 1**: Sorry, I was just finishing up another meeting, so.
**Jdawson**: No, it's.
**Jdawson**: It's okay.
**Jdawson**: Give me a quick second.
**Jdawson**: Let me grab my jacket.
**Jdawson**: It gets.
**Jdawson**: It's getting cold in here.
**Jdawson**: Give me like, two seconds.
**Jdawson**: I'll be right back.
**Speaker 1**: I got mine on.
**Speaker 1**: I get it.
**Jdawson**: SA okay, I'm back.
**Jdawson**: Thank you for getting on this meeting so quickly.
**Jdawson**: I don't.
**Jdawson**: I don't sleep, but it looks like you don't either, because you responded at, like, 3:00am well, how.
**Speaker 1**: What's the difference in time?
**Jdawson**: An hour?
**Jdawson**: I mean, I'm in Houston.
**Jdawson**: I'm in Texas.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: Only an hour.
**Jdawson**: I know we reviewed the whip last time based on what we had in Procore, the current jobs.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So when you're aware of the audit that's going on.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Or the audit we're trying to do for.
**Jdawson**: To get the license for Tennessee.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: So when we ran the trial balance and the financials, we realized that the revenue billed in 2024 didn't match the WIP, the revenue and the cost.
**Jdawson**: Because we had some jobs, I guess, that closed in 24 that are no longer in Procore.
**Jdawson**: So then I had to redo the web to include every single job that had either cost or revenue in 2024.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So I just wanted to look over it with you.
**Jdawson**: Most of them are not in procore anymore because they are complete.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: So I just wanted to see.
**Speaker 1**: Well, I can pull up old jobs in Procore, which.
**Jdawson**: Oh, you can?
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Let me pull them up.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, but see here?
**Speaker 1**: Maybe not see.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I only see.
**Speaker 1**: I see back to 2023.
**Speaker 1**: Are these ones in 22?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we have some in 22.
**Jdawson**: I'm going to share my screen here real quick and log on to Prof.
**Jdawson**: Bar on the side.
**Jdawson**: So most of what we had.
**Jdawson**: You can see my screen, right?
**Jdawson**: Are you able to see my screen?
**Speaker 1**: Yep.
**Speaker 1**: I'm looking at the Excel file.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: And so most of what?
**Jdawson**: Most of the ongoing jobs, as you can tell, they're.
**Jdawson**: They're right here.
**Jdawson**: Based on, you know, the percentage.
**Jdawson**: Percentage, you know, complete as of 20.
**Jdawson**: As of December 2024.
**Jdawson**: These are some of the items that had billings and cost.
**Jdawson**: If you look at.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: The fiscal year to date column, these are the two numbers that I had to tie out.
**Jdawson**: Let me make it bigger.
**Jdawson**: The build.
**Jdawson**: The revenue to date, like the 2024 revenue in Acumatica was 9.6 million, and the cost was 7.3 million.
**Jdawson**: So I just had to Go in and identify what made up this 9 million what jobs.
**Jdawson**: And these are the jobs.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Right here.
**Jdawson**: So I know for a fact that.
**Jdawson**: So the revenue and the cost I got from Acumatica.
**Jdawson**: So that I know is right because those are invoices paid and ar invoices billed.
**Jdawson**: But what I really wanted to look at was the contract amounts and under completed jobs.
**Jdawson**: I guess I just went.
**Jdawson**: Went with what's in the system.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: But you know, if you have something else we can reference, especially on the bottom part too.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, so I see if we can.
**Speaker 1**: I don't know if we go through them in order like everything in the top box we have or Are you missing anything from that one?
**Jdawson**: No, I think everything in the top box is correct.
**Jdawson**: I got from job planner and Procore.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, so 22103 that yes.
**Speaker 1**: Don't have.
**Speaker 1**: Let me see here.
**Jdawson**: Oh, and.
**Jdawson**: And with all of these, they.
**Jdawson**: They want the contracts as well.
**Jdawson**: So if you have them, if you can email them to me, that'll be great.
**Speaker 1**: Which ones?
**Jdawson**: Everything that's on the web.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, some of it they do purchase orders instead of a contract.
**Speaker 1**: So.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I have two here that I purchased that Brandon mentioned that they will purchase orders, but we can discuss those when we get to the bottom.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, so the radio.
**Speaker 1**: See here I'm gonna see if I can share my screen.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: This is only organizers.
**Jdawson**: Oh, I mean I don't know why it does that.
**Jdawson**: Let me change the settings here.
**Speaker 1**: Think plum.
**Speaker 1**: I need like an alito background fake ass living room.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, they.
**Jdawson**: That's one of like, you know, the first things they tell us when.
**Jdawson**: When we start.
**Jdawson**: Hey, yeah, we have all these background options here.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So no, so this is say on here.
**Speaker 1**: Well, this was 22 103, the radio project.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: This is the owner pay application folder.
**Speaker 1**: So I pulled up the last one they show in here which is three.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: And that's this one here which puts total contract after change orders 115-776-8822.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so I can update that right now.
**Jdawson**: So contract amount 11256 change orders.
**Speaker 1**: But that's weird because.
**Speaker 1**: So you showed one 170.
**Speaker 1**: So there's this in this same folder and maybe that.
**Speaker 1**: This adds up here.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Folder.
**Speaker 1**: It's got a pco.
**Jdawson**: This is.
**Jdawson**: This one may be a typo on my end because this is supposed to be a formula.
**Jdawson**: Let me put that here.
**Speaker 1**: Because they show a change order.
**Speaker 1**: Number one, there's only 26,000.
**Speaker 1**: But that doesn't make sense.
**Speaker 1**: If the net change orders are 35 or 37.
**Jdawson**: 5, 37.
**Speaker 1**: And what formula you say pulls that out?
**Jdawson**: This one is just the original, original contract plus the change order.
**Jdawson**: So right now if I put in 137 5, 1, 2 22, that puts the contract about 1.57.
**Speaker 1**: And 15 7.
**Speaker 1**: So this, if you add 1511577 6, 8 plus.
**Speaker 1**: Yes, because this date on this is December 22nd.
**Speaker 1**: PCO is dated.
**Speaker 1**: Well, this is in October, so it was before that.
**Jdawson**: October.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: But if you add 26,000 that put it way over 172.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: So this record keeping wasn't very good back then.
**Jdawson**: Okay, what was the final payout?
**Jdawson**: So I think the final payout would have had all the correct information.
**Jdawson**: So do you think the 26,000 is included in that net change orders of, of.
**Jdawson**: Is it called 37,000?
**Speaker 1**: Well, yeah, because.
**Speaker 1**: And then again this isn't the final pay app because there's a 43,000 balance to finish.
**Speaker 1**: But in this folder, the pay applications, that was the last one.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, here's more PCOS.
**Speaker 1**: There's a PCCO which should combine all the change orders.
**Speaker 1**: That's the 36,000.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: 3,623.
**Speaker 1**: That's different number.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, it might have been an additional one after that.
**Jdawson**: 1157.
**Jdawson**: Yeah but it.
**Jdawson**: Oh here obviously previously change orders.
**Jdawson**: I think the 1300 plus the 36 yet.
**Jdawson**: So looks like the 1157, 768.
**Jdawson**: But let me check.
**Jdawson**: So in acumatica what it will show me if I go to the project, it'll show me the.
**Jdawson**: I guess the net build Arkansas and cost.
**Jdawson**: So for 22 I go to 103.
**Jdawson**: For 22, 103.
**Jdawson**: I think that may have been where I got that number from.
**Speaker 1**: So does it go off of what was billed or what they got paid?
**Speaker 1**: Because that December pay app was the one I had open for 22.
**Jdawson**: For 22 this.
**Jdawson**: So I think in acumatica under the project, it's going off of whatever it was that hit that, that project overall.
**Jdawson**: So overall it's saying that actual income was 1,000,170 and then actual expenses was 940,000.
**Jdawson**: And but we know at the time that, you know, record keeping wasn't.
**Speaker 1**: Well, yeah, time to the job, you know, all of that went to overhead, like the flights, everything.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah.
**Speaker 1**: How did, how is he reconciling that or is he not able to at this point?
**Jdawson**: Right now we're not able to and that's something that I'VE I've discussed with the CPAs.
**Jdawson**: So what we will do is we'll take the income statement, the year to date numbers.
**Jdawson**: Like we'll take the year to date number.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so what.
**Jdawson**: What the CPAs will do is we're going to take year to date numbers and we might need your input on here, you and Brandon, since most of the salaries went there, wages, a lot of these expenses, retirement wages and salaries and just allocate it all went to overhead.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So we'll have to take a lot of these wages, salaries, travel, 186,000.
**Jdawson**: Insurance permits, office supplies was pretty, pretty hefty marketing truck.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we'll just have to take a lot of those and allocate them back to the jobs.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Speaker 1**: And again, where did you say the.
**Speaker 1**: Where did the 11705-5323, where did that come from?
**Speaker 1**: You're saying that's in Acumatica?
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: If you are you in akumatica right now?
**Speaker 1**: I've never logged in.
**Jdawson**: Oh, okay.
**Jdawson**: I can share my screen real quick.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So in acumatica, under the project when I click on say construction projects 22103 is this is what it shows.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: I don't have anything to surprise that I guess I have to be in maybe invited.
**Speaker 1**: Did have you asked Brandon if he's got that project in Procore?
**Jdawson**: No, I have not.
**Jdawson**: I can check with him later.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I haven't.
**Jdawson**: I haven't asked him about that project.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And.
**Jdawson**: And these are all, you know, since these are all complete, right?
**Jdawson**: These are all completed projects.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Since these are all completed projects, I would say yeah.
**Jdawson**: Oh, I know why I.
**Jdawson**: This was why.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: What was the change of the amount for this one?
**Jdawson**: Looks like I accidentally deleted for the document you just had up.
**Jdawson**: How much was it like 37.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, this one showed it as 37.
**Speaker 1**: 5, 12, 22.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And we would have billed and it shows built.
**Jdawson**: We would have built that whole amount.
**Jdawson**: Okay, right.
**Speaker 1**: We should have.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we should have.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: But they didn't.
**Speaker 1**: If they did it, they didn't save it, so.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Which I'm sure they did.
**Speaker 1**: This one at the 11:57 they had 43,000 left, so.
**Jdawson**: Oh, you know what?
**Jdawson**: I have access to Brandon's Procore.
**Jdawson**: Let me get on there to see if he has anything different from what you have is below.
**Jdawson**: Velour Construction Group, a subsidiary of Aliado.
**Speaker 1**: No Valor is the company I used to work for.
**Jdawson**: Oh, okay.
**Speaker 1**: How do they show up now?
**Jdawson**: When I go to log In.
**Jdawson**: When I click on his name and log in, it just gives me an option for what.
**Jdawson**: What company to get into.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I think we invited.
**Speaker 1**: Or I invited him when I was still working there to look at a project.
**Speaker 1**: So.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: You know, it's like a contractor.
**Speaker 1**: Bidder.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: So this is what it shows.
**Jdawson**: Active.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Inactive.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, there's word.
**Speaker 1**: I.
**Speaker 1**: I didn't click on that.
**Speaker 1**: Let me see.
**Speaker 1**: That's.
**Jdawson**: 22103.
**Jdawson**: Wait.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Speaker 1**: Radio.
**Speaker 1**: There's radio.
**Jdawson**: 22103.
**Jdawson**: It's under a different name.
**Jdawson**: Oh, is it?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, it's Radio.
**Jdawson**: Radio.
**Jdawson**: M.
**Speaker 1**: Bella cart.
**Speaker 1**: I see one in Pennsylvania.
**Speaker 1**: I don't see one in Maryland.
**Jdawson**: Oh, I.
**Jdawson**: If you scroll down, I saw it.
**Jdawson**: Look at the job numbers.
**Jdawson**: 22, 103.
**Speaker 1**: 22, 100, 104.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, right there, right there.
**Jdawson**: Go up a little bit.
**Jdawson**: A few more.
**Jdawson**: That one.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: RADIO MD and this contract amount in Procore looks like matches what wasn't it?
**Jdawson**: It's a bit closer to what was in Acumatica.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: It shows contract amount is higher.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: We're still owed money on it.
**Jdawson**: Romanian balance is 4242 14.
**Speaker 1**: So we have.
**Speaker 1**: These are the three change orders.
**Speaker 1**: So this is the one they didn't save.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: That's where it goes up to the 170.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And then the payments received match what I show in.
**Jdawson**: What I show in akumatica.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So I think it's Safe to use this.
**Jdawson**: 545122.
**Jdawson**: And what I'm going to do is I'm going to put.
**Jdawson**: Because this job is complete, right?
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: That remaining 4215, I'm going to put it back on the budget as a negative and just, you know, show it as a profit.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: All right.
**Speaker 1**: Glad you found that button.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I wish I had found it last night and I didn't have to bother you, but I.
**Jdawson**: I still wanted you to look at it because I think the more we kind of talk through the whip, we'll both get a better understanding of what we wanted to present.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: So what was the next one?
**Jdawson**: I think.
**Jdawson**: Let me try to fix this one.
**Jdawson**: 42.
**Jdawson**: Contractor.
**Jdawson**: Oh, I need to put it on.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so next one is Cooper Road, 22104.
**Jdawson**: Oh, actually, let me check on the budget on this one before just to make sure everything was okay.
**Jdawson**: 9, 40, 113.
**Jdawson**: So is.
**Jdawson**: Is there a reason.
**Jdawson**: And I know this.
**Jdawson**: This was in the past and probably before you, but on the budget, I noticed that there will be an original budget on this one radio original budget was 1.13 million, which is more that pretty close to the contract.
**Jdawson**: But then the job today cost detail was only 940,000.
**Speaker 1**: See here this showed an original budget of 1132 063.
**Speaker 1**: What the what?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, Acumatica shows a total cost of 940, which is the job to date cost details.
**Jdawson**: I'm assuming that that is correct.
**Jdawson**: 930, 100, 940.
**Jdawson**: The job to date cost detail.
**Speaker 1**: This shows.
**Jdawson**: Oh yeah.
**Jdawson**: If you go back, back towards the front a little bit right there.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Out to date like everything.
**Speaker 1**: None of the.
**Speaker 1**: Nothing's been updated up here.
**Speaker 1**: All these are an automatic except these two.
**Jdawson**: And we know that it didn't include the labor.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, but these like up here, like you can see like direct cost is like job to date.
**Speaker 1**: There's like nothing.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, very little.
**Speaker 1**: But like this here, estimated cost of completion.
**Jdawson**: So the issue with using that number right now, let's say that the 1.1 million was the budgeted cost.
**Jdawson**: The problem with using that right now is that the job is complete.
**Jdawson**: And acumatica only shows job today's cost of 940,000 because the labor was in, you know, wasn't taken into account.
**Jdawson**: And this is from 22 and 23.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So I would say since this job is over and they're just going to take it off the whip, I'm really surprised that the CPAs from last year or the CPAs that's been doing the taxes of priorities didn't bring this up or have some form of.
**Jdawson**: Some way to account for the labor.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Especially if, you know, I don't know.
**Speaker 1**: I'm not a tax person but I mean his overhead, you know, that gets taken out before the profit.
**Speaker 1**: Maybe that's why, you know, I don't know why he didn't.
**Speaker 1**: You know, Brandon was just setting up a lot by himself too.
**Speaker 1**: So.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, he just thought that was too much work to.
**Speaker 1**: To get implemented.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And he's not on, you know, his.
**Jdawson**: He's not an accountant either.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: But you know, with the CPA filing the taxes and doing adjustments at the end of the year, I'm really surprised that they, they didn't do that.
**Jdawson**: That part.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, for sure.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: But let's, let's look at the, the Cooper Road 22, 104.
**Speaker 1**: So that's.
**Speaker 1**: And last time he pointed it out to me.
**Speaker 1**: But when I look at what.
**Jdawson**: That one is not in profile.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I didn't see that.
**Jdawson**: Oh, Actually I do.
**Jdawson**: It's.
**Jdawson**: I guess with the names they are in alphabetical order.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Right below.
**Jdawson**: Right below.
**Jdawson**: Siva Memphis.
**Jdawson**: Oh, you don't see it?
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Oh yeah.
**Jdawson**: Brandon has 22 display and you have 19.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: I.
**Jdawson**: I see it on my end.
**Jdawson**: Cooper Road.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: I'll put it up.
**Jdawson**: Duh.
**Jdawson**: Contract shows.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: 267.
**Jdawson**: 329.
**Jdawson**: That's correct.
**Jdawson**: Original budget was 23842 and change orders were 36,487 old.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So right here, this matches what I had.
**Jdawson**: Now I just have to google up the budget and see okay which the revised budget is usually the same.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: I just have to go in and take out the contract items.
**Jdawson**: The revenue.
**Jdawson**: Contract revenue.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: 38, 42, 36.
**Jdawson**: I'm gonna move this back here so you can help me find the contract revenue.
**Jdawson**: It'll be right this section.
**Jdawson**: Right 55.
**Speaker 1**: Well yeah.
**Speaker 1**: The contractor fee is shown as 24 303.
**Jdawson**: Where is that?
**Speaker 1**: Right over to the right.
**Speaker 1**: They had one approved change order that.
**Jdawson**: Oh okay.
**Jdawson**: Right here.
**Speaker 1**: 317.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so then the total for the.
**Jdawson**: Do we take this whole line item 55 as the Revenue on this project?
**Speaker 1**: Well there's.
**Speaker 1**: Where.
**Speaker 1**: So on a project you know you're going to be over and under on all these lines above it.
**Speaker 1**: So if you don't balance everything out, it can.
**Speaker 1**: And if they don't have everything set to automatic, you really scroll all the way over to the right if everything's left in to automatically calculate.
**Speaker 1**: So like if you look at that forecast to complete that column, if that lightning bolt is not next to a number, someone has manually manipulated the final cost.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: So you know in some cases like.
**Speaker 1**: Like that say that 4068 or 65 it pulls across if there's no cost.
**Speaker 1**: If you scroll to the left like if there's never been a cost and there won't be a cost that hits that then that can show up as profit and then projected over under you would add the fee plus the 6204.
**Speaker 1**: If that's an accurate number that would actually be the profit on that job.
**Speaker 1**: Okay but I don't without going through this and seeing because you know you can have.
**Speaker 1**: And what happens in Procore is the purchase orders, they don't sync with payments made to submit.
**Speaker 1**: That gets a purchase order only subcontracts.
**Speaker 1**: So when we pay for material that was ordered under a PO it doubles it up.
**Speaker 1**: It acts like we still owe that amount to the purchase Order and it doesn't subtract or apply that payment to them.
**Speaker 1**: So in those cases I have to, I go in or the pm.
**Speaker 1**: You have to physically go into the end of that project, the finish and make it manual so that it doesn't act like you're over budget on that line.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So on this project the cost is this complete?
**Jdawson**: This project is complete, right?
**Speaker 1**: Yes, for sure.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jdawson**: Cooper Road.
**Jdawson**: So the cost shown in Akumatica is 185,000 compared to the budget here.
**Jdawson**: But let me see.
**Jdawson**: Pending.
**Jdawson**: So is this correct?
**Jdawson**: Just job to date cost detail.
**Speaker 1**: If you can scroll, I'm going to put you on a little bigger screen.
**Jdawson**: Here and see if I can make it bigger.
**Jdawson**: You want it to be bigger or you want me to scroll over?
**Speaker 1**: You can scroll over.
**Speaker 1**: You can also collapse that column on the left hand side.
**Speaker 1**: That's got the send ERP and all that.
**Jdawson**: It'll make the screen a little wider, this one.
**Speaker 1**: See the minimize sidebar down there at the bottom?
**Jdawson**: Oh, that part.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, so we I guess first go all the way to the right.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: So we have 2950 left in Cooper Road insurance expense.
**Speaker 1**: So if the job's over, that's not going to happen.
**Speaker 1**: That should be made to a zero and then it'll show that that profit.
**Speaker 1**: That means it made another 2950.
**Speaker 1**: If you click on the, the next to the lightning bolt.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, click on that and then go make it manual entry and then add new line.
**Speaker 1**: So then you want to just put whatever the cost of date in that column in.
**Speaker 1**: In that line item is.
**Speaker 1**: You know what that is?
**Jdawson**: The cost to date based on.
**Speaker 1**: Based on procore.
**Jdawson**: Based on procore.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So if you go back to this budget, see.
**Jdawson**: Right here.
**Speaker 1**: Not, not, not overall but just for this particular line.
**Jdawson**: Particular line.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Which was, which one it was here.
**Speaker 1**: Well, it was the 2950, 51 and there's been no direct cost or anything for it.
**Speaker 1**: So.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, so you just make that a zero and hit.
**Speaker 1**: So it's zero already.
**Speaker 1**: Just hit save on the bottom to go down to.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, just add new line item.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: Click this again.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Oh shoot.
**Jdawson**: It just added another one.
**Speaker 1**: Click that.
**Speaker 1**: I guess you're gonna have to put a description in there.
**Speaker 1**: Maybe just say final audit or something.
**Speaker 1**: Now you can X out of it and it should.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: So there you see how it took when he made that a zero.
**Speaker 1**: It kicks over the projected over under since that money is not going to be spent.
**Speaker 1**: And now it adds.
**Speaker 1**: So now it's 9155, we should be making extra.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: And so, you know, like the, there's another one of those.
**Speaker 1**: So.
**Jdawson**: So on this, on this job, what is safe to say that is the cost, I guess.
**Speaker 1**: Well, the projected cost.
**Jdawson**: Like it, the total cost.
**Speaker 1**: Well, there's where the projected cost, like, I guess if you're looking at it that way, then committed costs, rejected costs must be just that totals up all of the things that have hit the job.
**Speaker 1**: V.
**Speaker 1**: Scroll up a little bit.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, you should be able to do that.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Like that's safe since it's a done job.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Cross coming in then.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, that's right.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So I think that should.
**Jdawson**: And it's pretty close to what Acumatica had because ecumatica had about 185, 778, which is about 12, 1200 dollars more in cost.
**Jdawson**: So I think it, then it's just safe to make.
**Jdawson**: I'll just make this budget.
**Jdawson**: If I make it 1-843-4347.
**Speaker 1**: I'm not even an accountant, but when I, you know, as a pm, like if my budget's off by one penny, it'll drive me crazy and I gotta find out what it is.
**Speaker 1**: So it's amazing.
**Speaker 1**: Like just the lack of, like.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, yeah, it's, it's numbers at the wall to try to make them fit it, you know.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: But you know, that's from being in construction for so long.
**Jdawson**: That's, that's what differentiates the good PMs from the, you know, the not so good ones.
**Jdawson**: Because I've, I've seen how PMs, the result of PMs not being held accountable or given full, full, you know, like control and made to take responsibility of their budgets.
**Jdawson**: They'll just dump stuff everywhere.
**Jdawson**: And then when the project is bad, then you leave and go find another job, right?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: For more money, typically.
**Jdawson**: Exactly.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I was telling Fritzi yesterday because I, I, I talked to her a lot just to kind of get her to kind of know what you guys are looking for when you ask, you know, when you ask questions, just to go, go in and look.
**Jdawson**: I, I think she's really good.
**Jdawson**: She just needs to learn what you guys are needing.
**Jdawson**: So yesterday I was telling her that I think Glenn is one of the most active PMs I've, I've ever seen.
**Jdawson**: He's just trying to get his cost and his budget right.
**Jdawson**: He's, he's looking at it, which is what you do.
**Jdawson**: If you look at it all the time.
**Jdawson**: You'll know when Stuff gets.
**Jdawson**: Gets missed.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And she's looking into.
**Jdawson**: I.
**Jdawson**: I need to call him because I don't want him to feel like I ignore his emails, but I get so swamped.
**Jdawson**: I have to 10 clients and I've been spending I think 90% of my time on.
**Jdawson**: On Aliado.
**Jdawson**: But I'm definitely going to schedule a call with him to make sure that he's.
**Jdawson**: He's getting everything he needs because I know he has a new.
**Jdawson**: New project and, and he's new, so just, you know.
**Speaker 1**: Yep.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: No, I think if you do that, you can go through all these jobs and if you base it off of that, you're.
**Speaker 1**: You should be good.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And these are all closed, right?
**Jdawson**: Oh, these are.
**Jdawson**: So this one.
**Jdawson**: I know this job got canceled.
**Jdawson**: This is Brennan.
**Jdawson**: Pittsburgh.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, we had to give them.
**Speaker 1**: I think that's where we had to give back.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Like 500 grand.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: Zion Pratt Whitney.
**Jdawson**: Is this still ongoing?
**Speaker 1**: No, that should be done.
**Jdawson**: That's done.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so then the billing because the Bill today is 453, which is correct is the cost.
**Jdawson**: Maybe I need to adjust the cost then because we billed 321.
**Jdawson**: Let me, let me pull that one up then.
**Speaker 1**: Give me one second.
**Speaker 1**: We're right back.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: All right, not a problem.
**Jdawson**: 15 SA.
**Speaker 1**: All right, back.
**Jdawson**: Okay, this one.
**Jdawson**: 4:53 seems correct.
**Jdawson**: And that was with bill.
**Jdawson**: Need to look at the budget.
**Jdawson**: 3, 3 21, 22.
**Speaker 1**: 231 1, 22 jobs here.
**Speaker 1**: No, no, there it is.
**Speaker 1**: 2311 2.
**Speaker 1**: So is that showing as active?
**Jdawson**: Yes, it is showing as active.
**Speaker 1**: 312 shows it's been invoiced 100%.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And we've.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we've received.
**Jdawson**: It's been invoiced 100%.
**Jdawson**: It's the cost that I need to true up.
**Jdawson**: If it's complete, then I have the budget at 4:06.
**Jdawson**: But it said the projected projected cost was 325.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, 3 6.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: Should I just adjust it to the 325?
**Speaker 1**: And what is.
**Speaker 1**: What are you showing now or what did.
**Speaker 1**: Let's see what you had before.
**Jdawson**: Before I had 406, I had the contract amount, which is the 453 and then on the line 55 line items, which is the insurance and fees and all that stuff.
**Jdawson**: I had 46,000.
**Jdawson**: But if I take the projected cost to complete 325 or 3,686, that does bring it to 99% complete with only 4,000 left to bill.
**Jdawson**: I mean, 4,000 left in cost.
**Jdawson**: Is this completely.
**Jdawson**: Is this like, done, all cost and everything done?
**Speaker 1**: I believe so.
**Speaker 1**: Other than adding in the late.
**Speaker 1**: Well, here they actually charge some project management labor.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So I'm thinking should.
**Jdawson**: Should I true it up to the cost or just leave this.
**Speaker 1**: And you're saying Acumatica showing more cost than 325?
**Jdawson**: No, it's showing less.
**Jdawson**: It's showing like 321.
**Jdawson**: So 3200 less.
**Speaker 1**: It maybe got a credit on an invoice or something that didn't get pushed through.
**Speaker 1**: So I would leave.
**Speaker 1**: I would just leave the 325.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: So leave the 225.
**Jdawson**: And everything else is pretty up to speed.
**Jdawson**: Lakeshore temp.
**Speaker 1**: That's my job.
**Speaker 1**: So if I got it screwed up, you let me know.
**Jdawson**: But let's.
**Jdawson**: Let's look at that one.
**Speaker 1**: Then I fixed my.
**Speaker 1**: I updated the budget several times, and then they just keep charging stuff to it.
**Speaker 1**: I'm like, oh, really?
**Speaker 1**: I don't mess with this anymore.
**Speaker 1**: So.
**Jdawson**: Make sure.
**Jdawson**: Is that one complete?
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, it's done.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: I don't know why.
**Speaker 1**: Like, it's.
**Speaker 1**: I guess this one charged a lot of my labor to this project.
**Jdawson**: Oh, your.
**Jdawson**: Your time.
**Speaker 1**: My time.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Well, this was really the only job I had going on to build to when I first started, so.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Cost.
**Jdawson**: Was.
**Jdawson**: What was the margin on this job?
**Jdawson**: Was it.
**Jdawson**: Was it pretty good?
**Jdawson**: It show it.
**Jdawson**: It's not much.
**Jdawson**: Sheet is showing about 27%.
**Jdawson**: Is that right?
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So even with.
**Jdawson**: With your time hitting the job, you.
**Jdawson**: You still pulled at 27.
**Jdawson**: That's good.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: The projected cost to complete, projected budget.
**Jdawson**: Projected cost 882.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, 882.
**Jdawson**: The cost of acumatica was 865.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so should I just leave this?
**Jdawson**: Looks like there was extra.
**Jdawson**: Extra money.
**Speaker 1**: Acumatica is only showing 865.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Let's see.
**Jdawson**: And.
**Speaker 1**: That may be.
**Speaker 1**: Let me see here.
**Speaker 1**: Cost.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, we haven't paid the electrician yet.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: That's what, That's.
**Speaker 1**: That makes me wonder because that seems to happen.
**Speaker 1**: It's like things, you know, I don't know what the reminder system is for vendors who are owed payment and don't get paid.
**Speaker 1**: Because that's, you know, what we're looking at with when, like Windward Electric.
**Speaker 1**: It's Windward, right?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: The one you sent me yesterday.
**Jdawson**: I.
**Jdawson**: I believe so.
**Jdawson**: So when the invoices.
**Jdawson**: Would the electrical invoices come from Procore, and that's synced into ica.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I'll show you my screen.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: And that's what's.
**Speaker 1**: You know, I didn't know what's going on there.
**Speaker 1**: And they were a great sub, so I don't.
**Speaker 1**: I feel bad if we haven't paid them because I thought we had paid them everything but their final retainage because.
**Speaker 1**: So this is them to go to invoices.
**Speaker 1**: Like it says erp status not ready.
**Jdawson**: Not ready.
**Jdawson**: So that means they need to be pushed to Akumatica.
**Speaker 1**: But I can't push anything.
**Speaker 1**: When I open one of these up, like this one.
**Jdawson**: Are they approved?
**Jdawson**: Because they.
**Jdawson**: They have to be approved.
**Jdawson**: If.
**Jdawson**: If it was approved, it'll say it's not ready to be sent to erp.
**Jdawson**: So something is missing.
**Speaker 1**: Well, the status says approved, so why would it.
**Speaker 1**: Who else needs to approve it?
**Jdawson**: Is that the one that Fritzi messaged me about?
**Speaker 1**: Could be.
**Jdawson**: Okay, let me take a.
**Jdawson**: You go back to the invoice screen and I'll take a screenshot.
**Jdawson**: Oh, actually, I can just put it up here.
**Speaker 1**: I put that last email I sent you.
**Speaker 1**: I did a screenshot of this.
**Jdawson**: You did a screenshot?
**Jdawson**: Okay, let me forward it to her to look.
**Jdawson**: Look into it while we see.
**Speaker 1**: And that sounds like that would be the difference between cost and acumatica and our.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Projected final cost.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And this is.
**Jdawson**: Let's see.
**Jdawson**: You said we need to delete some invoices posted in Procore three times.
**Speaker 1**: Well, there was the one thing of, like, if you look here at payments issued.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: It's showing we paid them.
**Speaker 1**: This pro course thinking we paid them 223.
**Jdawson**: Okay, okay, okay.
**Jdawson**: That's what she's talking about.
**Speaker 1**: She's saying it posted three times.
**Speaker 1**: So maybe because of that it wouldn't allow us to pay them anymore to sync those.
**Speaker 1**: Maybe that's why upping their contract amount.
**Speaker 1**: If that doesn't get fixed.
**Jdawson**: So let me.
**Jdawson**: Because she was working on fixing those.
**Jdawson**: I'm going to send her this to push.
**Jdawson**: Try to push these through.
**Jdawson**: I just sent the list to Fritzi, so I need to make a note of the lecture.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: 24, 103.
**Speaker 1**: And I'm surprised.
**Speaker 1**: Like, I would have thought they'd have given me a call if they hadn't received payment by now.
**Speaker 1**: So I'm not sure.
**Speaker 1**: Like, does Acumatica.
**Speaker 1**: Do they show the payments that were made?
**Speaker 1**: What are they showing?
**Speaker 1**: Because I just talked to my steel guy for Ridge Haven this morning, and I'm like, we just got paid, so we're gonna try to pay you.
**Speaker 1**: And he's like, what do you mean?
**Speaker 1**: I've already been paid my draw.
**Speaker 1**: I'm like, really?
**Speaker 1**: And he's like, yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Like, so I guess we paid before we get paid by the owner.
**Speaker 1**: So.
**Speaker 1**: But yeah, I don't.
**Speaker 1**: Like, are we.
**Speaker 1**: We're not trying to send out another check on that, are we?
**Jdawson**: No.
**Jdawson**: And.
**Jdawson**: And what?
**Jdawson**: And.
**Jdawson**: And that's common in construction because most people will be on a paid when paid.
**Jdawson**: You know, you pay when you receive the payment.
**Jdawson**: And that's something we can eventually get into.
**Jdawson**: Right now how it works is every week we'll look at the AP agent and pay the.
**Jdawson**: And pay the invoices due per Brandon's instruction.
**Jdawson**: So that's why that's happening.
**Jdawson**: But that can be, you know, that can be risky in case an owner decides not to pay.
**Jdawson**: Not to pay for something.
**Jdawson**: So maybe that's something we need to bring up.
**Speaker 1**: Well, two, we get like, these are all smaller jobs till now.
**Speaker 1**: Now when you get something like Westfield Collective, where there may be a like 800, 900,000 build in a month, you don't want to cover that.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Before it comes in.
**Jdawson**: Before comes in.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So this is a job.
**Jdawson**: Let's see.
**Jdawson**: Commitments.
**Speaker 1**: You know, they were telling me I was talking to someone, a sub here in Florida.
**Speaker 1**: Like, and I don't know if things are changing, but they do not.
**Speaker 1**: It used to be like we'd write a subcontract and it was paid when paid, but by Florida law, a contractor can't do that anymore.
**Speaker 1**: Like, you owe that sub the money whether the owner pays you or not.
**Speaker 1**: So like, that's going to change a lot because some of these owners are slow pay and you know, they're gonna.
**Speaker 1**: Everyone.
**Speaker 1**: They're gonna lean all their properties, you know.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: And I don't know, like, we would.
**Speaker 1**: And maybe they're making it so us as the GC has to lean the owner.
**Speaker 1**: I don't know.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that'll be interesting here in.
**Jdawson**: In Texas because I.
**Jdawson**: I work for a heavy.
**Jdawson**: You know, Heavy.
**Jdawson**: Have a civil company before.
**Jdawson**: Before working for Plum and on the text that contracts, that's.
**Jdawson**: That's where it states it, you know, paid when paid.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: But if you don't.
**Jdawson**: But you expect to.
**Jdawson**: They are very.
**Jdawson**: They enforce that too.
**Jdawson**: If you receive payment and you don't pay this up, then, you know, that's a.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: You got like 10 days to pay them or something.
**Jdawson**: Exactly.
**Jdawson**: Oh, my God.
**Jdawson**: I used to have this lady, she was.
**Jdawson**: What did she do?
**Jdawson**: Foundation.
**Jdawson**: She did like foundations or something like that.
**Jdawson**: And she Was the only woman owned company in the Houston area.
**Jdawson**: Really the most difficult person I have ever met.
**Jdawson**: So unreasonable.
**Jdawson**: But she knew she, she would have.
**Jdawson**: Have the contract because they, they had to engage, you know, a woman or a minority owned.
**Jdawson**: Minority owned business.
**Jdawson**: And she was the only one.
**Jdawson**: Every Friday she'll be at the office looking for her check.
**Jdawson**: I'm like, ma'am, come on.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Speaker 1**: Well, I guess she probably got paid the best.
**Speaker 1**: So.
**Jdawson**: But in the end they, they tried.
**Jdawson**: What that did was they tried to avoid using her.
**Jdawson**: They only use her as a last resort because she was so, so difficult.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Let me see.
**Jdawson**: Can you see?
**Jdawson**: Okay, let me share my screen here.
**Jdawson**: I'm looking at winword in acumatica.
**Jdawson**: I think you should.
**Jdawson**: I think it'll be helpful for you to get an acumatica login and just be able to see what's.
**Jdawson**: What's in there, you know, compared to Procore.
**Speaker 1**: So Brandon, I think he's given me one.
**Speaker 1**: I just haven't.
**Jdawson**: Okay, let me know if I need to reset.
**Jdawson**: Reset the password.
**Jdawson**: I can do that for you.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So I'll go to construction projects and then 24103 under the Commitments.
**Jdawson**: This just changed.
**Jdawson**: Okay, maybe Fritzi just made the change for those invoices.
**Jdawson**: So cost of date is 179.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I guess.
**Jdawson**: Why does it say 179 and then 169?
**Speaker 1**: Well, because.
**Speaker 1**: Let's see down here.
**Speaker 1**: Is there a amount paid line there?
**Speaker 1**: Unbilled amount 16, 4.
**Speaker 1**: That's 10.
**Jdawson**: 450, 10 4, 5.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So that makes the two billings in Procore like 18,000 something.
**Jdawson**: Okay, let me refresh this because this had.
**Jdawson**: This is not something probably got bushed through.
**Jdawson**: Okay, commitments 17 and 9.
**Jdawson**: Is this.
**Jdawson**: Let's see.
**Jdawson**: This is the same amount that.
**Jdawson**: So after Fritzi deducted those, corrected those overpayments.
**Jdawson**: 66, 89, 53, 619 2.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Oh, she said it's.
**Jdawson**: It is now synced.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: I might have to open up.
**Jdawson**: What's.
**Jdawson**: December.
**Speaker 1**: Still shows 223, 161 in Procore.
**Jdawson**: Anyways in Pro Core.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: It still stays ready to think any of those data.
**Jdawson**: There are two that are dated December.
**Jdawson**: Oh, this is retained age.
**Jdawson**: So it's just this one?
**Jdawson**: Pretty much.
**Speaker 1**: There's retainage and then a small.
**Speaker 1**: They had a change order at the very end and then just a little bit of retainage for that change order, which is like 300 bucks or something.
**Jdawson**: Oh, I think this is the One we were having trouble with.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: I remember this because I think because the retainage invoice was sent, it was getting confused after it got an additional change order after the retainage was released.
**Jdawson**: Because if you notice.
**Jdawson**: Let's see.
**Jdawson**: Teenage.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I'll.
**Jdawson**: I'll talk to Fritzi about this one.
**Jdawson**: She's saying that it synced, but I don't see it.
**Jdawson**: It still doesn't say that here.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, it doesn't say that, but I think you're right.
**Jdawson**: Once we get that, that should fix.
**Jdawson**: That should fix the cost on that one.
**Speaker 1**: So we are still.
**Speaker 1**: We owe them.
**Speaker 1**: How much does it say?
**Jdawson**: It just says there's 24,000 unbilled or less cost.
**Jdawson**: Because the cost in Iumatica is 865 and Procore.
**Speaker 1**: Is 8.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah, Procore is about 882 is the projected cost.
**Jdawson**: Okay, yeah, I'll correct that one.
**Jdawson**: And then I think everything else was pretty.
**Jdawson**: There's just one more that has shows.
**Jdawson**: These are the only ones that show money left on it.
**Jdawson**: Goodwill Excel budget is.
**Jdawson**: Is good with Excel complete.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, it's done.
**Speaker 1**: I just wonder, look through the invoicing here, see if maybe not paid someone.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: I can make shows 1,000,749, 548 projected cost.
**Jdawson**: Is this projected cost, you know, correct?
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I'm looking through it here on my screen, just trying to see like.
**Jdawson**: Let me.
**Jdawson**: I'll look in akumatica also.
**Jdawson**: What's that project number?
**Speaker 1**: Okay, so yeah, that's.
**Speaker 1**: That's.
**Speaker 1**: I think just us.
**Speaker 1**: I had to project down.
**Speaker 1**: So that is not going to be spent.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Because of a.
**Speaker 1**: And we had.
**Speaker 1**: See there was.
**Speaker 1**: That was one where we had a door po that was showing more.
**Speaker 1**: So, yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Cost.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So that.
**Speaker 1**: That'll go away.
**Speaker 1**: That's simply the whole thing with the purchase order and the cost hitting a job.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: I had to manually project it down on the budget, but it still shows up in projected cost in that column.
**Speaker 1**: So I have to go through all the jazz and I think about that.
**Speaker 1**: I don't know.
**Speaker 1**: And trying to figure that out.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Probably more.
**Jdawson**: So what's in akumatica?
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, that's correct.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: 1-749-69839.
**Jdawson**: So I will make that 5, 4, 8, 39.
**Speaker 1**: So that job, that's only showing what.
**Speaker 1**: 325 in profit.
**Jdawson**: Which, which.
**Jdawson**: This one.
**Jdawson**: That's.
**Jdawson**: That.
**Jdawson**: That's just showing Romanian cost.
**Jdawson**: Wait, which one?
**Jdawson**: Which one are you talking about?
**Jdawson**: Sorry.
**Speaker 1**: Well, the profit on that job is set.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, oh, profit 591.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: All right.
**Speaker 1**: That makes sense.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so do you agree with like, some of these have more like this cart Memphis?
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Do you agree with the gross profit margins?
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: What's the contract amount on that one?
**Jdawson**: Contract amount showed 408.
**Jdawson**: That's job number 23108.
**Jdawson**: Contract amount shows 108.
**Jdawson**: And I can.
**Speaker 1**: Because our contract amount for that.
**Jdawson**: Okay, let's look at it then.
**Speaker 1**: Is.
**Speaker 1**: So that one should be.
**Speaker 1**: Because we.
**Speaker 1**: It's the.
**Speaker 1**: We had.
**Speaker 1**: We separated the it to purchase orders because of the owner could direct purchase some of the equipment to their leasing company.
**Speaker 1**: But it still is shown 408.
**Speaker 1**: But it's actually.
**Jdawson**: Is it related to this one right here spo the CSC card?
**Speaker 1**: No, that's 23 108.
**Speaker 1**: I'm sorry.
**Speaker 1**: That's correct.
**Speaker 1**: I'm sorry.
**Speaker 1**: That's right.
**Jdawson**: Oh, this is correct.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: I was thinking it was the new cart job that's different.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so.
**Jdawson**: And the cost is.
**Jdawson**: Let's confirm that the projected cost is correct.
**Speaker 1**: Should be.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So it had a, you know, 46% margin pretty much.
**Speaker 1**: Probably.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that's.
**Jdawson**: That's what it shows job committed.
**Speaker 1**: But that's only because those.
**Speaker 1**: The overhead on that one, if you.
**Speaker 1**: If you isolated it to that would be probably a lot higher.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So then when we split the overhead, then we have to take that into.
**Jdawson**: Into, you know, consideration.
**Jdawson**: So I think what I'll probably do is send you and Brandon the overhead cost for 20, 24, for travel, for salaries, all of that.
**Speaker 1**: Can you.
**Speaker 1**: If would.
**Speaker 1**: If you could break that down by month, like the cost by month, then Brandon will know, like, he'll remember like kind of when the jobs were going on.
**Speaker 1**: And then.
**Speaker 1**: Then he can probably allocate that pretty.
**Speaker 1**: Pretty close to which job they were working on to when that all was accrued.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: All right, so we.
**Jdawson**: We have it here by month.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, perfect.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So I'll.
**Jdawson**: I'll send it to you and him and I don't know if we.
**Jdawson**: It would be.
**Jdawson**: Probably be easier to just get on a meeting.
**Jdawson**: Do you think it'll be easier to get on a call or just put it on.
**Jdawson**: On his desk and have him allocated?
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, he's.
**Speaker 1**: I gotta call him in a minute here, but just email it to us and say, okay, just present that question and then I'll talk to him and see how he wants to do it.
**Speaker 1**: But that'll be good.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I think is pretty.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, like that.
**Speaker 1**: Like Lakeshore, like all the overhead hit that job okay, but that was a 24 job.
**Speaker 1**: And I don't know if it's.
**Speaker 1**: It's the 20, you know, the first half of the year for 24, nothing was going to the jobs, and I think then it started to hit the jobs after.
**Speaker 1**: So we'll have to look at that too.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Oh, yeah, because then the 24 overhead.
**Jdawson**: Well, if there were any, any of these ongoing jobs, most of them didn't have a lot of activity in 24.
**Jdawson**: If you look at, you know, the fiscal year to date numbers, maybe put this here, the fiscal year to date, these are the jobs that had cost, you know, cost of revenue.
**Jdawson**: Most of these didn't have much.
**Jdawson**: These were just, you know, corrections, I guess, from.
**Jdawson**: From prior years.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, but these were the jobs that actually had activity in, in 2024.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, that looks accurate.
**Jdawson**: Okay, what about these POS?
**Jdawson**: So how do the POS work?
**Jdawson**: I don't see.
**Jdawson**: I mean, is there a contract amount?
**Jdawson**: Is there a budget?
**Jdawson**: I mean, I'm guessing.
**Jdawson**: Or is it like a.
**Speaker 1**: So is it usually.
**Jdawson**: Are they usually lump sum or are they, you know, time and material?
**Speaker 1**: Well, we sent a proposal with our stoves and what's included, and then they write a po.
**Speaker 1**: That's what goodwill does, that just approves the, the amount.
**Speaker 1**: And then everything's based off of the budgets we put into child plan or Procore.
**Speaker 1**: So it's similar.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so this CSC cart, what job was that?
**Jdawson**: I mean, CSC in 2024, there was 6, 663,000 bills.
**Jdawson**: So the reason why I have them here is because when I went into acumatica, there was no job.
**Jdawson**: It was hidden.
**Jdawson**: It was hitting the contract revenue, but there was no job associated with it, which was something that happened a lot in the past.
**Jdawson**: I'm not sure why I comeatica allowed that, but normally accounting system will not allow you to hit, you know, cogs or the contract revenue unless a job number is specified.
**Jdawson**: But I can medica does and maybe that's something we need to speak to, you know, revive about.
**Jdawson**: Like, hey, if there's no job number, block it to where it won't hit, you know, contract revenue.
**Jdawson**: There needs to be a project number to tie it to a project.
**Jdawson**: So for these two items, there were this villain.
**Jdawson**: 600 and 663,000.
**Jdawson**: But no, no job.
**Jdawson**: I don't, I don't know what, what CSC is.
**Speaker 1**: I think that is probably that equipment that the owner wanted to pay for directly and maybe that's why it had to be different.
**Speaker 1**: Possibly that's all I could think of.
**Jdawson**: Okay, what.
**Jdawson**: What is csc?
**Jdawson**: Is it one of.
**Jdawson**: One of.
**Jdawson**: One of.
**Jdawson**: Is it, you know, cold card?
**Jdawson**: Is it.
**Jdawson**: I know it's one of the cart jobs.
**Speaker 1**: So csc, that's their.
**Speaker 1**: That's their.
**Speaker 1**: Like, probably their leasing group because that equipment would have been bought for cart cold storage.
**Speaker 1**: The job.
**Speaker 1**: 2 4, 108108 or 106108.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: I don't see 108 in here.
**Speaker 1**: 24, 108 active.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So we are transitioning that job to job planner.
**Speaker 1**: So it was starting.
**Speaker 1**: It was started in Procore.
**Speaker 1**: So that's why I'm.
**Speaker 1**: Or did they put it as a closed job?
**Jdawson**: Okay, so 24108 Aspen Ridge Haven.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, it's 24106 is Winchester.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that's what I thought.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: 24 106.
**Jdawson**: So then do we include that 600,000?
**Jdawson**: So this.
**Speaker 1**: Well, but it's.
**Speaker 1**: I don't know how they.
**Speaker 1**: It doesn't look like that cost.
**Speaker 1**: The cost still showed.
**Speaker 1**: See, like that's showing how much cost for that job.
**Jdawson**: Let's be showing cost to date.
**Jdawson**: 1.3 million.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, so that's Right.
**Speaker 1**: So I don't know.
**Speaker 1**: Maybe that's just an accounting thing.
**Speaker 1**: When they had to.
**Speaker 1**: To make it look like the owner was purchasing it directly.
**Speaker 1**: Like, we still build the owner for what we charged for that equipment, and then they paid.
**Speaker 1**: I don't know.
**Speaker 1**: That's all I can think of something to do with that.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Otherwise, I don't know what that is.
**Speaker 1**: But you're just saying cost that was paid.
**Jdawson**: No, actually, it's.
**Jdawson**: It's actually a billing.
**Jdawson**: It's actually a billion to the owner.
**Jdawson**: And if I was to add that to this, that will bring our balance pretty close to what it should be.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So then we build the owner separately for that equipment.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: If I was to add it in here and it could just.
**Jdawson**: Just be an akumatica thing.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: If I do.
**Jdawson**: If I was to add the 663-3-48 here.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: This sounds more accurate considering the cost.
**Jdawson**: And, you know, because the cost was at 1.3 million, so this would actually make more sense.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Nope.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So let me look in one more time.
**Jdawson**: Hard code storage.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: What.
**Speaker 1**: So you're saying there's materials needed.
**Speaker 1**: You just didn't order.
**Speaker 1**: Jesus today.
**Speaker 1**: You hold one second.
**Speaker 1**: Let me just finish up with Fatima here.
**Speaker 1**: Hey, Fatima, I just.
**Speaker 1**: I just emailed you the CSC invoices for that job.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: I think that there if you go into the owner pay apps, those two invoices, and there's also an invoice for entrance gates, so maybe that may solve all those numbers, because all those numbers.
**Speaker 1**: 600 something.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: Do you want to call me back when you're done?
**Jdawson**: You can.
**Jdawson**: I'll be here.
**Speaker 1**: All right.
**Speaker 1**: Thank you.
**Jdawson**: Okay, no problem.
