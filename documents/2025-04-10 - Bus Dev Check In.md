## Transcript
**Bclymer**: What's up?
**Speaker 1**: You on the road yet?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Nice.
**Bclymer**: Not moving very fast on the north side.
**Speaker 1**: You hitting traffic?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, it's all stop and go.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, well, I don't take too much of your time, man.
**Speaker 1**: I'm still doing a little research.
**Speaker 1**: I called as far as the low hanging fruit we talked about, about Bo Pahood, I called Kyle Klein who's actually knows him really well.
**Speaker 1**: That's how I met Bo and I told him to come up with some ideas for me.
**Speaker 1**: And so he said he'll think of something I would call.
**Speaker 1**: That would have been on Monday.
**Speaker 1**: I talked to him.
**Speaker 1**: I haven't followed up with him, but I still got a little more research to do on these guys.
**Speaker 1**: I was able to find this Isaac Bombos guy with the new city development doing that big playing field thing.
**Speaker 1**: He didn't have much on his Facebook, but I did find his wife and did some more digging.
**Speaker 1**: She's got an art studio downtown Indy.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: So I don't know if it's out of the question.
**Speaker 1**: I, I thought about maybe for a second like buying her art, but I feel like then that's just like kind of shitty to like support her and.
**Speaker 1**: But oh, hey, I want to talk to your husband.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I would not, I would not try to get to him through her because that's, you know, I think about like how protective you are of your wife.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: If somebody was doing that, if somebody was doing that to you, you'd be pissed.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I would be really mad.
**Bclymer**: Now it, now it does give you a better window into.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so she has an art studio.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So if you think of like high end art gallery or something like that, like an event, tickets, things like that might be appreciative.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: You know, four tickets to that.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Like him and his wife are going to go and then you know like you and Liz or something like that's, you know, something where it's like, okay, that's leveraging, knowing his wife likes that.
**Bclymer**: But also it's, you're, you know, it's to him.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Speaker 1**: I know you can't see this because you're driving, but that's the route I was going there other than that.
**Speaker 1**: So I'm still working on finding some creative ways, so bear with me.
**Bclymer**: So the, the one thing with your, your client buddy.
**Bclymer**: So one, one piece of advice I would give you on that is, you know, you talk to him on Monday, you haven't gotten back to him, you haven't got it.
**Bclymer**: I would say within 97 certainty he hasn't thought about that since you hung up the phone?
**Speaker 1**: Probably not.
**Speaker 1**: Well, this is his brother too, so it's not actually like Ryan, but either.
**Bclymer**: Way, yeah, okay, either way, whoever it is, the person you talk to 97 certain that they did not think about it after you hung on the phone.
**Bclymer**: Now, in that situation, what you might do is, you know, hey, Bob, whatever the guy's name is, you know, thinking about things that this guy Mopa Hood likes, blah, blah.
**Bclymer**: Okay?
**Bclymer**: I was like, well, you know, just off top of your head, like, if you can name three things, what are the first three that you think he would like, you know, off top of your head.
**Bclymer**: Because more than likely that's what you're gonna get anyway.
**Bclymer**: But it also spawns his gut reaction to be like, yeah, I mean, he likes this and this and this.
**Bclymer**: And it gives you something because you're gonna call him back and he's gonna say, oh, you know, I was, you know, didn't really think about it.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: You know, oh, I think he likes blah, blah.
**Bclymer**: Like, he's not actually putting any real effort or thought into it.
**Bclymer**: It's just if he knows the stuff off top of his head or what his gut instinct is, it's probably the best you're gonna get.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I hear you.
**Bclymer**: You know, but like.
**Bclymer**: But like, when he was like, oh, you know, I don't know.
**Bclymer**: Be like, okay, but if you did know, what would you say?
**Speaker 1**: Yep, I'll bug him.
**Speaker 1**: I mean, obviously I was.
**Speaker 1**: Since our meeting Thursday, I haven't put a ton of thought into it until yesterday when I was on the plane.
**Speaker 1**: So I had a little downtime on Monday, but being on site and stuff, I just didn't had other stuff to do.
**Speaker 1**: I didn't make it a priority.
**Speaker 1**: Sorry for that.
**Bclymer**: Honestly, like.
**Bclymer**: Like, from.
**Bclymer**: For me, like, with my business development, like, especially when I was starting out and, like, trying to learn, I do 90% of it at night.
**Bclymer**: And literally the only thing I do during the day is actually make the phone calls.
**Bclymer**: And even then, if it's a warm introduction or something, I'm texting the people at night a lot of times, and they'll get back to me.
**Bclymer**: But I do 90, all my research, everything, all at night.
**Bclymer**: When I'm uninterrupted, I'm not distracted.
**Bclymer**: And then it's very easy for me to be like, okay, I'm gonna call these three people tomorrow.
**Bclymer**: I throw it on my calendar, get a reminder, I call them.
**Bclymer**: You know, they don't answer.
**Bclymer**: I move it to three hours later.
**Bclymer**: In the day or four hours in the day.
**Bclymer**: Like, I.
**Bclymer**: I always will call them in the morning, like midday, mid morning.
**Bclymer**: And then if they don't answer, I'll push it to the afternoon, give another shout.
**Bclymer**: They don't answer.
**Bclymer**: Then I might kick it a week or something like that.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, that's smart.
**Speaker 1**: Which, I have my list.
**Speaker 1**: I just got to do it.
**Speaker 1**: And it doesn't take that long, but it's.
**Speaker 1**: And I've been saying this now for a year, two years.
**Speaker 1**: It's easy to get lost in ops.
**Speaker 1**: And even then, it's like the tyranny of how.
**Speaker 1**: Or whatever it is you call it.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, the tyranny of how.
**Bclymer**: Instead of just being like, all right, well, I'm just gonna do one thing, like, and it'll figure itself out.
**Bclymer**: Like you.
**Bclymer**: Instead of thinking the entire thing through, just do the next step.
**Speaker 1**: Just do something.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, like, just do the next step.
**Bclymer**: Like, there.
**Bclymer**: There's no.
**Bclymer**: There's no.
**Bclymer**: At least to my knowledge, secret handbook of what to do for business development.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: There's a million ways to skin a cat.
**Bclymer**: And so, you know, part of it is just doing something right.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Like.
**Bclymer**: And maybe that's just the standard cold call or whatever, and you're going to get better at it, whatever.
**Bclymer**: But, like, you know, I try to.
**Bclymer**: I'm trying to give you tactics and this, that, the other, you know, like.
**Bclymer**: But there.
**Bclymer**: There's no one size fits all, you know, I just.
**Bclymer**: This is.
**Bclymer**: These are tactics I use that, you know, in my experience and what I discovered seem to be efficient if done correctly.
**Bclymer**: But it's.
**Bclymer**: It's research intensive on the front end, you know, and the best time to do said research, honestly, is at night a lot of times, you know.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Because I'm not bothered by, like today, all morning.
**Speaker 1**: I was just working on figuring out where I could find heads on the phone for two hours, so.
**Bclymer**: Right, exactly.
**Bclymer**: Which, by the way, did you give a call the Siemens and let him, you know, tell them, here's the ultimatum or what?
**Speaker 1**: I called Rob.
**Speaker 1**: He said he was in a meeting, he's gonna call me back.
**Speaker 1**: But it is 408, so I'm.
**Bclymer**: I'll.
**Speaker 1**: I'll copy you in on my response.
**Speaker 1**: I know what Cannon.
**Speaker 1**: That's a different issue.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I'll copy you in on it.
**Speaker 1**: I'll respond here.
**Speaker 1**: I'm gonna call him first.
**Speaker 1**: I want to get him on the phone first before I just write an email like that.
**Bclymer**: I would agree.
**Speaker 1**: So I know he's working on it.
**Speaker 1**: He at least was Able.
**Speaker 1**: I mean, at the beginning of the day, I was gonna have to source like over a thousand heads.
**Speaker 1**: Now I only have to source 690 on back order is what he's telling me.
**Speaker 1**: So other than that, you know, they bumped me again about that newsletter list.
**Speaker 1**: So here's what I'm doing.
**Speaker 1**: As I.
**Speaker 1**: As I've been purging these, I'm.
**Speaker 1**: I'm labeling them as newsletters.
**Speaker 1**: I've got the majority of a lot of them deleted.
**Speaker 1**: And so I'm just marking them as newsletter list.
**Speaker 1**: And then I can do.
**Speaker 1**: I can.
**Speaker 1**: I can filter it and export it.
**Speaker 1**: So I'll have that to them here in today.
**Speaker 1**: Tomorrow.
**Speaker 1**: I'll work on it tonight.
**Speaker 1**: I got some other stuff in ops I got to get done though.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Have you created the job and everything for Nema and the, The Decatur job?
**Speaker 1**: I'm putting the budget in for phase two right now because I have two more.
**Speaker 1**: I have three.
**Speaker 1**: How many do I have here?
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I have three invoices that need to go to phase two.
**Speaker 1**: And so talking with Jesse yesterday when I was at the airport, I asked him what he wanted me to do and he told me to just.
**Speaker 1**: We're just gonna.
**Speaker 1**: It's.
**Speaker 1**: It's now job 25, 110.
**Speaker 1**: Phase two is.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So it's totally separate and we're gonna just code everything to there because things were hitting.
**Speaker 1**: I noticed my fate, my phase one project, which they shouldn't be.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, we don't want that.
**Speaker 1**: Correct.
**Speaker 1**: So I'm putting that budget in right now and I'll get everything else into while I'm here in job planner.
**Speaker 1**: So I'll have that done today for you to look at.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: And other than that, I went ahead and signed for the cdr.
**Speaker 1**: You're fine with that, right?
**Speaker 1**: Because Neiman is going to take forever.
**Speaker 1**: For Neiman.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I mean, you signed their.
**Bclymer**: You signed their name or what?
**Speaker 1**: No, I signed my name as an owner's rep.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: I called Jerome and asked him if that was an issue.
**Speaker 1**: He goes, dude, sometimes I sign it.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, it's not a big deal.
**Speaker 1**: So.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: All right, good deal.
**Speaker 1**: You looking forward to tomorrow?
**Bclymer**: What even.
**Speaker 1**: What even is it or this weekend?
**Bclymer**: It's.
**Bclymer**: It's called Strategic Coach.
**Bclymer**: So we have a quarterly meeting, one like one day meeting every quarter, you know, so it'll be like an all day thing.
**Bclymer**: You know, if you, if you Google Strategic Coach, you can read about it, but it's.
**Bclymer**: It's a business thing.
**Bclymer**: So, like every.
**Bclymer**: Every quarter.
**Bclymer**: What?
**Speaker 1**: Not the Same as that executive growth network, is it?
**Bclymer**: No, that's different.
**Bclymer**: But the guy that heads up the executive growth network suggested strategic coach.
**Bclymer**: That's why I tried it out.
**Bclymer**: But basically, like, you know, every quarter you meet and you, you know, go over, you know, one aspect and then you, you spend the next three months, you know, working on implementing that.
**Bclymer**: So like last.
**Bclymer**: Last quarter.
**Bclymer**: Last quarter, the, the thing was, you know, implementing, you know, prep days, work days and free days and there's, they use different terminology, but that's the, that's exactly what it is.
**Bclymer**: So like, you know, a prep day or strategic day, you know, like where you're like planning and in prepping, you know, for, for like what you got going on and you know, where you, like, the growth is, you know, the work day is like, you know, actually doing tasks and, and you know what we would.
**Bclymer**: Traditional work.
**Bclymer**: And then, you know, the free day is like you don't work at all.
**Bclymer**: And it's, you know, you do what you like, you know, or something like that.
**Bclymer**: And it's.
**Bclymer**: The whole point is about, you know, recharging yourself, you know, because if we just work all the time and never shut off, we're going to run out of energy.
**Bclymer**: And so, yeah, you know, doing, doing that is what the, what that one was.
**Speaker 1**: It's almost like time blocking.
**Speaker 1**: Because you only have seven days in a week, right?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, but it doesn't mean that like, so for instance, like, it doesn't mean that I have to do, like, it's not like I have to do a prep day, work day, free day.
**Bclymer**: Like, it's, you know, you might go, you know, you know, a whole month and then, then I might have a.
**Bclymer**: Two free days in a row or whatever that is.
**Bclymer**: Like, it's, it's, it's mixed up.
**Bclymer**: Or, you know, you might have two prep days or three.
**Bclymer**: Like, it's just, it's just more along the lines of, you know, chucking it into like, okay, like what is the activities and so that you can stay on that, you know, so you're not getting basically just pulled into fires.
**Speaker 1**: That's cool.
**Speaker 1**: I'll be interested to see what this next one is.
**Speaker 1**: So it's an all weekend thing?
**Bclymer**: No, it's just tomorrow.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Speaker 1**: You going to Florida next week?
**Bclymer**: Just one all day thing.
**Bclymer**: No, I'll be here.
**Bclymer**: I gotta go to Newark or Pennsylvania.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, that's right.
**Speaker 1**: Well, I just know I was talking.
**Speaker 1**: I've been trying to get with Jesse just so I don't have to, you know, calm.
**Speaker 1**: So much.
**Speaker 1**: We just get together in the morning, So I called him this morning.
**Speaker 1**: He said he was coming to Indy, so I figured you'd be somewhere.
**Bclymer**: No, because Megan hasn't moved out yet, so.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, well, we can talk about that next week.
**Speaker 1**: Is that a problem?
**Bclymer**: No, I mean, it's just.
**Bclymer**: I mean, you know, I.
**Bclymer**: I told.
**Bclymer**: I.
**Bclymer**: I got.
**Bclymer**: I told her, you know, stay here as long as you need.
**Bclymer**: Like, I just, you know, she.
**Bclymer**: She doesn't want, you know, me there.
**Bclymer**: Obviously.
**Bclymer**: It makes sense.
**Bclymer**: Like, you know, it's gonna.
**Bclymer**: It'd be hard on both of us.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, that's tough.
**Bclymer**: You know, I'm fine with, you know, staying in India and working out of here.
**Bclymer**: Like, you know, I'd like to get down there, but, you know, it is what it is.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: All right, dude.
**Speaker 1**: I won't bother you too much tomorrow then.
**Bclymer**: There's some work going on up here.
**Speaker 1**: You're probably passing the leap stuff.
**Bclymer**: No, this is, like, downtown.
**Bclymer**: I'll pass the leap stuff here soon.
