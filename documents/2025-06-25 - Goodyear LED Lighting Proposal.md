## Transcript
**William.twickler**: Is basically I was on the call yesterday and I was request.
**William.twickler**: We were planning to have a call trying to do some value engineering about the design to reduce cost.
**William.twickler**: But you know, at the same time I was requested better.
**William.twickler**: You guys can give us more information about the LED lighting because we got other two quotes as it is required by procurement.
**William.twickler**: But you know, we had a call yesterday to compare the proposal and there was a lot of questions.
**William.twickler**: And so you know we have to get a lot of more information.
**William.twickler**: You guys are in really good shape.
**William.twickler**: I know you have done work for Bill before and based on what we have told us that you.
**William.twickler**: You have done a great job.
**William.twickler**: So I mean Bill accepted the call.
**William.twickler**: He's gonna be on the call and again for a few more minutes.
**William.twickler**: And let me pull out the email that you sent me last time.
**William.twickler**: Just give me a second right here.
**Bclymer**: So let me just trying to teach you guys.
**Bclymer**: Second time.
**Bclymer**: There you go.
**William.twickler**: I know you gave me some information already and you give me a breakdown about labor material.
**William.twickler**: Right.
**William.twickler**: But you know, I know that.
**Bclymer**: Okay, you go.
**William.twickler**: See there's a three.
**William.twickler**: No.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**William.twickler**: Yeah, he's good, Ben.
**William.twickler**: Basically the other people provided a lot of more information.
**William.twickler**: And you know, I got on the in the call yesterday and people start asking me questions about how we're going to compare with you guys.
**William.twickler**: When you guys have, you know, it is in the good shape from the cost standpoint.
**William.twickler**: And that's basically what you know, they provided the photometrics thinking about the design and they did some photometric draft based on the 30 foot candles on the aisles and 40 put candles on the receiving and shipping area or the workstation area.
**William.twickler**: So you know, that's what I kind of did change the title of the call and then I resend it again.
**William.twickler**: So I'm gonna give few minutes to Bill.
**William.twickler**: If not then I just gonna go, you know, you guys just give me more information.
**William.twickler**: Because people was concerned about it saying there was no any photometrics or any more details, you know in the proposal.
**Jdawson**: So is it just the photometric or what other information are you guys looking for?
**William.twickler**: I think well what they let me pull out.
**William.twickler**: You know I put a spreadsheet yesterday together based on what they told me.
**Bclymer**: To do and kind of some do.
**William.twickler**: Some analysis about it.
**Bclymer**: I can find it here.
**William.twickler**: So.
**William.twickler**: And I want to kind of, you know, really get with you guys because honestly you guys are in a really good, good shape.
**Bclymer**: To the question is would we be doing a photometric?
**William.twickler**: I mean let me get the information.
**Bclymer**: I was, I was sent before that I went there yesterday.
**Bclymer**: Where the hell do you send me these?
**Bclymer**: I cannot find it.
**Bclymer**: Now listen to me.
**William.twickler**: Oh, there you go.
**William.twickler**: Basically, you know, some of them just gave me cost.
**William.twickler**: Like I.
**William.twickler**: I put in an email.
**William.twickler**: I don't have that in here.
**William.twickler**: But it was more, see, labor material contingency.
**William.twickler**: Some of them provided information about.
**William.twickler**: I think it was the kind of lighting or the kind of fixtures.
**William.twickler**: I think you provided that.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I sent you guys a cut sheet.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, so.
**Jdawson**: So, yeah, we didn't.
**Jdawson**: We didn't include a direct contingency line item in the lighting because we knew we were including it in the base proposal.
**Jdawson**: You know, it's.
**Jdawson**: Which we included.
**Jdawson**: If you.
**Jdawson**: If you look at that, there's a contingency line item in there for that, you know, which.
**Jdawson**: That number also includes our lighting.
**Jdawson**: So, I mean, if we.
**Jdawson**: If we wanted to pull it out and say, all right, let's allocate XYZ contingency, you know, for this.
**Jdawson**: For this po, we could do that.
**Jdawson**: But, you know, we were, you know, we're.
**Jdawson**: We're assuming.
**Jdawson**: I mean, you guys want to go with one person, do all this.
**Jdawson**: Like, it would, you know, that's.
**Jdawson**: That's obvious.
**William.twickler**: Like, that would be the ideal.
**William.twickler**: Yeah.
**William.twickler**: The concern here is.
**William.twickler**: And what did it happen here on the other.
**William.twickler**: Hey, Bill, you're here.
**Speaker 3**: Sorry, guys.
**Speaker 3**: Sorry, guys.
**Speaker 3**: I was late from another meeting.
**William.twickler**: I started already a little bit.
**William.twickler**: I thought you were not really going to join the call.
**William.twickler**: And I explained to them that I just did change the call to go kind of go on the LED lighting.
**William.twickler**: You know, basically, we couldn't compare bits because, I mean, we needed more information and there was a lot of people in the team asking a lot of questions.
**William.twickler**: So I know Brandon was kind of explaining that, you know, since they included everything in the.
**William.twickler**: In the main bit, the original bit.
**William.twickler**: So he said he didn't just really provided the information, but Brando, I probably, you know, I don't know how we probably Our mistake.
**William.twickler**: We didn't share this with you.
**William.twickler**: Basically, what.
**William.twickler**: At the end, we had to.
**William.twickler**: I treated the scope of work as a separate scope of work because the time constraint.
**William.twickler**: So the other people, they weren't going to be able to do it like what you guys, I mean, told us before.
**William.twickler**: So I dealt with GC and said, okay, I don't need you to do LEDs.
**William.twickler**: You haven't been on site at the time.
**William.twickler**: It's a lot of work.
**William.twickler**: It's a challenge with the racking and the installation.
**William.twickler**: So I, you know, I took that as A separate scope of work and bill jump in at any time.
**William.twickler**: So that's.
**William.twickler**: That was what we're planning to do.
**Jdawson**: So.
**William.twickler**: But at the same time, procurement.
**William.twickler**: Procurement requested for me to get three bids.
**William.twickler**: So that's why, you know, I was requesting additional information.
**William.twickler**: So we have a call today, late afternoon kind of to go.
**William.twickler**: To go through it.
**William.twickler**: I mean, if you can, you know, probably the, the, your proposal just for lighting would be a little higher.
**William.twickler**: See, now you are requested to include the contingency and I mean, just give us labor material contingency and timeline.
**William.twickler**: I know at one time I thought it would take five months, but it wouldn't be by phases since it's a lot of work.
**William.twickler**: But I know I sent you an email with the breakdown.
**William.twickler**: So if you can provide that kind of information, we have a call this afternoon, then we can probably make a decision and it would be great.
**William.twickler**: I mean, I.
**William.twickler**: Then your proposal, main proposal will go down because then you will have to remove those one points.
**William.twickler**: I think it was 1.7 for the lighting.
**William.twickler**: So, you know, I think you guys are in really good shape so far.
**William.twickler**: I mean, I don't have all the bits yet because they were due by the 28th thing that it was so much work.
**William.twickler**: And basically normally you give it a month in the amount of homework they have to do.
**William.twickler**: And you guys were able to provide that pretty quick, probably in two weeks.
**William.twickler**: So that's, that's what we have.
**William.twickler**: And bill jumping it just provided more information.
**William.twickler**: I don't know.
**William.twickler**: I mean, if I'm missing anything.
**Speaker 3**: So I just want to be clear on two points.
**Speaker 3**: 1.
**Speaker 3**: Hey, Brandon, do you have.
**Speaker 3**: Do you guys have the email that Hermes is referring to on what he was asking for?
**Jdawson**: I'm not sure if you could resend it.
**Jdawson**: I'm in the car right now.
**Jdawson**: But Hermes, if you can resend it, I'll make sure we get all that stuff answered.
**Jdawson**: I thought that I looked through my email for anything unread from you and I didn't find anything, but obviously I make mistakes every day.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, if you could shoot that out, I'll make sure that we get all that stuff answered for you.
**William.twickler**: Okay, I will resend that.
**William.twickler**: Yeah, I send it.
**William.twickler**: I send that on.
**William.twickler**: You saw the email on 62620 was 5 days ago.
**William.twickler**: I think was Friday.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I probably just missed it and was trying to look at it.
**Jdawson**: So I apologize.
**William.twickler**: I know that.
**Bclymer**: That's fine.
**William.twickler**: I mean, I know we've been there many times.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: And then the sec.
**Speaker 3**: The second part to the question is really centered around the timeline.
**Speaker 3**: And Brandon, I don't know if you guys have kind of like sketched out what that timeline looks like.
**Speaker 3**: I think that would be important to kind of share that in writing.
**Speaker 3**: But, you know, again, I think you understand the constraints we're dealing with.
**Speaker 3**: We potentially are going to start standing up racking, you know, sometime either the week of the 14th or the week of the 21st of July.
**Speaker 3**: We are trying to be operational in the building, you know, in mid September.
**Speaker 3**: Not to say that all of that, you know, again, I'm trying to see what, what is possible here.
**Speaker 3**: That's maybe the way I should say that.
**Speaker 3**: I know this is a big, A big ask.
**Speaker 3**: It's a big, this is a big lift.
**Speaker 3**: So I, I guess we need to understand with confidence, you know, what, what you think your organization could deliver.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I mean, so the, the lighting would be.
**Jdawson**: It's four to six weeks out is the, is the lead time.
**Jdawson**: But what we would do is to get ahead of your racking.
**Jdawson**: Let's say it's the, the 21st and our lighting isn't going to get there until the 28th.
**Jdawson**: Whatever, it doesn't matter.
**Jdawson**: So we would go ahead and start installing all of the junction boxes and all of the, all the circuits.
**Jdawson**: And then that way, you know, let's say they get whatever 20 racks ahead before we get lights in.
**Jdawson**: We would just have to come back and those lights would already have whips.
**Jdawson**: And so it's much easier to go and install that.
**Jdawson**: And then what we, what we do initially is to also mitigate that.
**Jdawson**: Again, this is assuming we can get the lights in time is we would reuse as many of those existing lights in the aisles to stay ahead of those racking guys.
**Jdawson**: But we're also, I mean, you know, I'm confident that we can rush order 200 of them to get them here to stay ahead enough of that racking.
**William.twickler**: What, what about permitting?
**William.twickler**: I mean, I, I know most of the time take four weeks.
**William.twickler**: Hopefully there's no.
**William.twickler**: Any comments.
**William.twickler**: And then.
**William.twickler**: I know and also many times with the GCs or people do it if they start with doing the work up to the first inspection.
**Jdawson**: So, yep, that's exactly what we would do.
**Jdawson**: We would go ahead and start before we get permit issued, you know, just to stay ahead of that warehouse stuff.
**Jdawson**: And then as far as what we would do for permitting, so we would really just go in and a life safety plan, a couple other details, and then our MEPs, and we just get the most basic drawings.
**Jdawson**: We can submit them for Permit.
**Jdawson**: And then while that's in review, we turn our what's called construction detail drawings, finish those out.
**Jdawson**: That way we're not waiting around for a full complete detailed set that we're going to build off of.
**Jdawson**: We just give the municipality what they need to give us a permit.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**William.twickler**: That would be the approach there.
**William.twickler**: That is what kind of normal.
**William.twickler**: Sometimes many people do.
**William.twickler**: Since it's so much time constraint.
**William.twickler**: What about any documentation that you can provide from the layout standpoint?
**William.twickler**: I know the photometry that would give us all the detail, but I know to do the photometric takes time.
**William.twickler**: Any documentation you can provide that indicating that, you know, it will meet the 30 foot candles in the aisles and or 40 foot candles in the workstation areas or the shipping and receiving area.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, exactly.
**Jdawson**: So, you know, that's what, you know, meeting those averages, not an issue.
**Jdawson**: We just, again, we've done these enough, we kind of know what it is.
**Jdawson**: So we quickly did a takeoff.
**Jdawson**: But you'll have a full photo metric and everything showing, hey, this meets the requirements.
**William.twickler**: And that will be probably one in the middle of the design, I guess during the design phase.
**Jdawson**: No, I mean, if you release me tomorrow, let's say I'd have you a photometric, you know, next week.
**Jdawson**: Okay, yeah, finalized and everything.
**Jdawson**: And we'd already have lights rolling.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, so we would immediately again, get them ordered, get them there.
**Jdawson**: We've already got, we got a crew working down in Phoenix right now actually, that we would pull over to start doing some lighting in this to stay ahead of your racking.
**William.twickler**: So I know we, I think we're basically signing the lease today or this week so far, that's the plan.
**William.twickler**: So hopefully everything goes smooth.
**William.twickler**: I'll go to the agreement in, you know, our real estate department or my department that I work for.
**William.twickler**: You take a little bit of time.
**William.twickler**: So you have to go through legal.
**Speaker 3**: Let me ask, let me ask the question this way.
**Speaker 3**: If you were to, if.
**Speaker 3**: Let's just say, for hypothetically.
**Speaker 3**: Let's just say that we awarded this to you and you were to get this, you know, we were to say, hey, we're awarding this to you and we did that tomorrow.
**Speaker 3**: How soon would you need to be in the building.
**Jdawson**: As far as to start work?
**Speaker 3**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I mean, you know, we could be in there a couple weeks, you know, before your racking starts to get far enough ahead.
**Jdawson**: And honestly, I mean, you know, if your racking is starting the 21st, what that really means is you have 30 semis showing up and they're going to stage that stuff for a few days?
**Speaker 3**: No.
**Speaker 3**: So for clarity, the racking is actually going to show up the week of the 14th, but it may delay the assembly or install until the 21st.
**Speaker 3**: And that's not firm yet.
**Speaker 3**: But the racking is absolutely going to be starting to deliver on the 14th.
**Jdawson**: So then we would want to get in there, because whenever they start to get there, whoever it is doing your racking, they should go and do their layout for their aisles first.
**Jdawson**: And so what we want to do is as they, as they mark the floor, we want to go off of those markings because the drawings may say one thing, but in the field, they may shift that three inches and then all your lights are off.
**Jdawson**: So we always coincide to be lined up with when they start that racking.
**Jdawson**: So as soon as they, you know, hey, here's our anchor point, you know, blah, blah, blah, and everything's going to pull off this, then that way we can go in and start doing our circuit.
**Jdawson**: So we would plan on being in there right around that same time.
**Jdawson**: Whenever those guys show up is when we would plan on getting in there with lifts to get work done.
**William.twickler**: So, Bill, we, we got, we can request for the racking people to get ahead, you know, be there at least.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, Hermes.
**Speaker 3**: I've got some discussions going on with them.
**Speaker 3**: I want to firm up the install date and that.
**Speaker 3**: And so that's why I'm asking some of the questions.
**Speaker 3**: I am.
**Speaker 3**: But I think if I look at this.
**Speaker 3**: Let's see.
**Speaker 3**: This.
**Speaker 3**: This is the week, if we think about it.
**Speaker 3**: Next Monday is the 30th.
**Speaker 3**: I think it is.
**Speaker 3**: Let's see.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah, it is.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, 30th.
**Speaker 3**: And so, and, and, and so what that would mean is the 14th would be two weeks on Monday.
**Speaker 3**: The 21st would be three weeks on Monday.
**Speaker 3**: So are you saying you would likely be in there, what, the week of.
**Speaker 3**: The week of the 7th?
**Jdawson**: No.
**Jdawson**: I mean, not.
**Jdawson**: Because unless your racking guy is there, there's not a whole lot we can do because again, we want him to tell us where the anchor point is.
**Jdawson**: So more than likely, I would assume that he's showing up.
**Jdawson**: Their foreman is whenever the racking shows up.
**Jdawson**: So we would be there that, that same time, you know, because he's going to lay out, and then again, we have to, we have to base ours off his.
**William.twickler**: Yep.
**Speaker 3**: No, no, no, that's fair.
**Speaker 3**: And they could start marking.
**Speaker 3**: I think we'll confirm all those things.
**Speaker 3**: I'm just trying to start thinking ahead on where we are.
**Speaker 3**: And so I Think there's two parts to this that we need to clarify.
**Speaker 3**: Hermes with, you know, I'll talk to Malin A.
**Speaker 3**: We need to clarify when they will, you know, confirm that they're going to be starting delivery on the 14th, which I feel firm.
**Speaker 3**: Verify when they're going to start install and verify when they're going to start laying out the, you know, the racking.
**Speaker 3**: And then, you know, again we wait to see who's, how this is going to get awarded.
**Speaker 3**: But then we would have to coordinate, you know, the phasing to understand, lay down areas and all that to make sure that, you know, where they, where they stage material and all that is going to support the construction.
**Speaker 3**: So we can get into that, you know, kind of as a follow on.
**Speaker 3**: I think the main thing right now is to really try to understand the, the timeline and you know, some of these other points that you're requesting right now.
**Jdawson**: Do, you know, is the racking, is it 36 or 40 because it goes in fours typically.
**Jdawson**: Is it 36 or 40 on the height?
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: I just wasn't sure if it was 36 or 40.
**Jdawson**: I assume 36 because I think it's a 40 foot deck at the low.
**Speaker 3**: That's what my thinking is too.
**Speaker 3**: But in its palette.
**Speaker 3**: Well, we got a combination of palette and case rack.
**Speaker 3**: So yeah, we'll confirm that.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that's just, you know, for a photometric we need to confirm that.
**Jdawson**: I'm assuming it would be 36 because that pretty standard.
**Jdawson**: But if not, you know, we just, I want to make sure that we have the right photometric study done.
**Speaker 3**: Yep, absolutely.
**Jdawson**: And then, yeah, as far as, you know, timeline, obviously getting the lighting started and everything.
**Jdawson**: And then do, you know, like you mentioned, you know, active in September.
**Jdawson**: But you know, typically whenever we do these phase starts, it's like for instance, we got to have this many chargers up and running and this many, you know, whatever, like those critical components is what we'd want to phase and get you guys a tco, which shouldn't be an issue because you've already got an office there.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: And I think what we would do is, and Hermes, please weigh in here if you feel different.
**Speaker 3**: I think we would want to concentrate everything on the west side, let's call it the drawing west side of the building.
**Speaker 3**: So you've got the office area, we've got a charging bank over there.
**Speaker 3**: And then we've got, you know, the, the racking.
**Speaker 3**: So we work our way from drawing side west to east.
**Speaker 3**: And so our focus would be as we're building out like the charging area, you know, as it sits today.
**Speaker 3**: That would be probably the first area of focus unless there were some reason like, hey, we can get the other side up faster.
**Speaker 3**: But that would be the, you know, as an example, that would be, I think, how we would want to play this out so that we're kind of like working the entire building west to east and then that makes it a little bit simpler.
**Speaker 3**: There's some lines of delineation with regard to TCO and various things like that.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I agree.
**William.twickler**: Also, it's a west to east and I think south to north.
**William.twickler**: Think most of the people is going to be on the south side of the building, right, bill?
**William.twickler**: I think 60% it will be on the south side of the building.
**Speaker 3**: It is.
**Speaker 3**: So I think we start like in the southwest corner and then work our way.
**Speaker 3**: But I think again, I, I think we have a little bit more work to do on the actual how they're going to build their racking.
**Speaker 3**: If they're going to build so far out along the south, then come back to the west and get built so far out on the north.
**Speaker 3**: Or how that's going to be.
**Speaker 3**: I think we still, that still needs a little more fine tuning.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**William.twickler**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, perfect.
**Jdawson**: So, yeah, I mean, we'll, like I said, we'll get those, those questions in that email answered for you, Hermes, so that you guys, you know, have clarity on exactly what it is.
**Bclymer**: But Hermes, is it the one on LED lighting proposal you asked for, mobilization, contingency and timeline?
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Or the three things you didn't see in there?
**William.twickler**: Okay, yeah, that information.
**William.twickler**: So, so you can provide that before 4:30 Central Time?
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Speaker 3**: And Hermes, you want them to put that into a formal, into the formal quote, is that correct?
**William.twickler**: Yes, I, I think that they're right.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we'll, we'll revise the clarifications to call that out.
**Speaker 3**: And so one other thing I would suggest.
**Speaker 3**: And Hermes, you tell me if you feel different.
**Speaker 3**: I know that we put that in our requirement, but I don't think it was in your proposal.
**Speaker 3**: But if you're going to make and add these adjustments, I think I would put clarity in there that you're, you know, that this is, you know, this design is, is, is, is required to meet the 30 foot candles and the 40 foot candle requirements.
**Speaker 3**: So that we have that, you know, in the absence of like a photometric or something.
**Speaker 3**: Right now we have that as a essay clarification.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we'll, we'll make sure we call out the basis of Design, you know, per that for that drawing that we, we sent out.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Or you guys should say, and then.
**William.twickler**: You can send me an update, quote the main proposal with the update costs.
**William.twickler**: I mean that.
**William.twickler**: I appreciate that.
**Jdawson**: Then you want the lighting pulled out of that one, correct?
**William.twickler**: Yes.
**William.twickler**: Because then it would be a separate couple of work because the challenges we have with timing.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we'll pull that out.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**William.twickler**: That's what I have for now, unless anybody have any comments or questions.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Jdawson**: No, I mean, the biggest thing is, you know, we've got, you know, we're fortunate that we have, we have internal designers.
**Jdawson**: You know, we brought that in in house, you know, a little over a year ago or so.
**Jdawson**: So our plan would be to get started, get the base plan and get the MVPs rolling on design as soon as possible.
**Jdawson**: I think that's going to be your real, your real saving grace as far as timeline goes, is getting a base set of design drawings.
**Jdawson**: You know, if we know that things are going to change and whatever as design finishes.
**Jdawson**: But if we just get a base set submitted and in for permit, that's going to be a big time saver for you.
**Bclymer**: Sure.
**Speaker 3**: What is the.
**Speaker 3**: I did have one question.
**Speaker 3**: What's the lead time right now on the electrical panels and breakers?
**Jdawson**: I mean, we can get all the panels in, you know, under six to eight weeks.
**Jdawson**: The only thing, and I can't remember if there was any missing breakers as far as in the main distribution panel.
**Jdawson**: Off the top of my head, that would be the only thing.
**Jdawson**: That would be a little bit longer.
**Jdawson**: But that's not going to delay anything that might be, you know, talking 12 weeks, 14.
**William.twickler**: I added a bunch of pictures that I took last time I went there and, you know, probably just if you can look in there to see, you know, what they have on the main panels.
**Bclymer**: Well, Jesse is going there today.
**Bclymer**: We'll have him make sure.
**William.twickler**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: But either way, I mean, like say, say we have to get a.
