## Transcript
**Gducharme**: Sam.
**Gducharme**: Hey, Glenn.
**Jdawson**: How are you?
**Gducharme**: Good.
**Gducharme**: How are you?
**Jdawson**: I am pretty good.
**Jdawson**: I freaking just finally got a chance to go out for lunch and totally forgot we had a meeting.
**Jdawson**: So I'm on.
**Gducharme**: Oh, my gosh.
**Gducharme**: Now you're.
**Gducharme**: You're totally fine.
**Gducharme**: I don't think this will take too long.
**Gducharme**: I was going to just share my screen and just make sure that we're on the same page as far as, like, the little adjustments that we need to make.
**Gducharme**: So the first thing I think too.
**Gducharme**: I don't know if you guys have been running into this, but over the past, I don't know, a couple of years, once we start touching restrooms, even just the finishes, the city wants us to make them ada accessible.
**Gducharme**: So I'm wondering if we should.
**Jdawson**: Planning on it.
**Acannon**: Go ahead.
**Acannon**: Okay.
**Acannon**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: One on the left.
**Gducharme**: Yes.
**Gducharme**: I think the one on the left is potentially easier.
**Gducharme**: This one on the right.
**Gducharme**: I.
**Gducharme**: There's a lot of things on right now, but I think the best we can do is like potentially extend out to get our turn circle and then go down to just a toilet in this corner.
**Gducharme**: Now, obviously that's going to, you know.
**Acannon**: Require some additional work.
**Gducharme**: I don't know if that's feasible with what's there.
**Jdawson**: But we don't want to get into cutting the slab.
**Jdawson**: So what my idea was was we take the wall right that, that right now you go in and you go left or right to the bathroom.
**Jdawson**: And so we're gonna.
**Jdawson**: We're gonna wall off the door to the left and that wall is gonna come out so that that wall could come out and turn and hide that plumbing stack that goes right there.
**Gducharme**: Are you talking about this one over here on the left, like, sort of like going like this?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, exactly.
**Jdawson**: Those two circles you have.
**Jdawson**: So if we can.
**Jdawson**: Well, so right now that.
**Jdawson**: That bathroom has a wall in it.
**Jdawson**: I have pictures that I took yesterday.
**Jdawson**: But if you go into that bathroom.
**Jdawson**: I'm only talking about the bathroom to the left.
**Jdawson**: The bathroom on the right is getting that door.
**Jdawson**: That one's good to go.
**Jdawson**: So the bathroom on the left, when you go in and walk into that door.
**Jdawson**: We didn't demo that wall yet.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: So that wall that, that goes and touches that column and that, that little.
**Jdawson**: What is.
**Jdawson**: It's like a.
**Jdawson**: Like a antenna cable or a television, like Cat 5 cable, like a modem type thing.
**Jdawson**: There's sitting on a shelf right there.
**Jdawson**: It's just, you know, we'll tear that out, but right where your cursor, you know, right.
**Jdawson**: Kind of where your Cursor is no, to the.
**Jdawson**: To the right.
**Jdawson**: The other circle.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, so we got that.
**Jdawson**: And then there's.
**Jdawson**: In that wall that you're on over here is another plumbing stack.
**Jdawson**: And then there's a floor drain right next to the plumbing stack, the circle.
**Jdawson**: And so that circle is the column.
**Jdawson**: So we need to basically demo that wall.
**Jdawson**: Did you.
**Jdawson**: Do you have pictures?
**Jdawson**: I have a.
**Jdawson**: I have a picture I could pull up on my phone.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, if you could pull up a picture, that would be great.
**Gducharme**: Or.
**Gducharme**: Actually, I think you sent me at least this one here.
**Jdawson**: Let me get the best one.
**Jdawson**: I don't know how many I can send you right now, but.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so pictures worth a thousand words.
**Jdawson**: So we're gonna take that wall there on the left and just extend.
**Jdawson**: Extended.
**Jdawson**: You know, we'll extend it out, turn it left, cover that.
**Jdawson**: Make sure it covers that floor drain.
**Jdawson**: And then we'll return it back to that column.
**Jdawson**: And that little shelf above there that has all the foam lines or whatever.
**Gducharme**: You just remove it?
**Gducharme**: Yeah, just remove it.
**Jdawson**: Do something else with it.
**Jdawson**: Now when we do that, we'll use the left side of that column as basically, we'll frame up up to that.
**Jdawson**: Or maybe just on the.
**Jdawson**: You know, on the left side of that.
**Jdawson**: We'll take the wall and just go to the left side.
**Jdawson**: Then we'll have to, I don't know, return it to the right.
**Jdawson**: We'll basically just have to make a box.
**Jdawson**: Frame.
**Jdawson**: Frame.
**Acannon**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: Frame it out.
**Jdawson**: And then we can take.
**Jdawson**: Let's see.
**Jdawson**: Can I share.
**Jdawson**: How do I share another picture?
**Jdawson**: Let's do the whole process over again.
**Jdawson**: That's cute.
**Jdawson**: Can I not just share my screen?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, screen with audio.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: You can see my screen?
**Gducharme**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: What do you think about that?
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: All right, so this is approaching walking up.
**Jdawson**: So we got on the left.
**Jdawson**: Now this is looking into that bathroom.
**Jdawson**: So that wall right there is.
**Jdawson**: Was.
**Jdawson**: Is part of the demo plan that's supposed to go.
**Jdawson**: I guess it could stay kind.
**Jdawson**: It kind of wouldn't be bad for it to stay, actually, because we're just gonna, you know, frame, you know, come out over and back into that column.
**Jdawson**: All right, so now we're looking at.
**Jdawson**: From the other side.
**Jdawson**: So we got this room, and we have this plumbing up here, right?
**Jdawson**: All these holes in the.
**Jdawson**: In the.
**Jdawson**: In the raptors right there.
**Jdawson**: So we have four of those that we got a sister up.
**Jdawson**: So the plan is to take the.
**Jdawson**: All that PVC that's running through those rafters, those floor joists.
**Jdawson**: We're going to Drop them below.
**Jdawson**: And we're going to sister up those floor joists.
**Jdawson**: So to give it.
**Jdawson**: To make it.
**Jdawson**: Give it structural integrity back.
**Jdawson**: And then this pipe will run below the floor joists.
**Jdawson**: And when it wraps the corner here and ties in to this, this is actually going uphill here.
**Jdawson**: Like, it's.
**Jdawson**: It's not.
**Jdawson**: It's not slanted down anymore.
**Jdawson**: It goes up a little bit, and then it ties into that copper stack that comes out right here at the bottom.
**Jdawson**: And then we have this floor drain that I think it comes from the hot water tank.
**Jdawson**: There's two hot water tanks on the second and third service first and the third, first and second floor.
**Jdawson**: This is the lower floor, obviously.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: So without having to remove or move any of this plumbing, the hope is that we take that plumbing from the ceiling, we drop it down, we move it over, we tie it right back into where it needs to go.
**Jdawson**: We frame out drywall, a box around that plumbing stack.
**Jdawson**: And now we're left with trying to figure out the door.
**Jdawson**: So if we take.
**Jdawson**: If we take this room and we take that door and move it over to the left, and we take the wall that this panel is on, and we come past the panel and then kick out to the left, and then.
**Jdawson**: And then run the wall back out to.
**Jdawson**: Even with this.
**Jdawson**: Now we can create a door.
**Jdawson**: And you'd be.
**Jdawson**: You'd be able to enter.
**Jdawson**: You know, you'd be able to enter.
**Jdawson**: So this wall would have two doors on it.
**Jdawson**: Now, one door would get us.
**Jdawson**: Get you into the bathroom, and the wall would go in and turn, and that way we don't have to move that panel or anything.
**Jdawson**: Do it in front of the panel.
**Jdawson**: I don't know of a better option, but I know.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I think 6 square feet of space here and having to shift some walls.
**Jdawson**: But Jesse was talking about digging into the concrete and rerouting the plumbing underneath the slab.
**Jdawson**: I was like, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on, Jesse.
**Gducharme**: I mean, anything can be done, but.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: And then I am a little concerned about the restroom on the right hand side.
**Gducharme**: I mean, we can try to just sort of move forward with how it is, but it's like, I don't see a way to get that one.
**Gducharme**: Ada, until.
**Gducharme**: Unless we.
**Jdawson**: That's not the plan.
**Jdawson**: It was just the one on the left.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: Just the one on the left.
**Jdawson**: Is it required?
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Is it required?
**Gducharme**: I'm just concerned that the inspectors are going to come out and say, like, hey, you're touching this bathroom.
**Gducharme**: You need to make it.
**Gducharme**: Ada.
**Gducharme**: However, we could probably.
**Jdawson**: Every bathroom we touch has to be ada.
**Gducharme**: We have been.
**Acannon**: Yeah.
**Gducharme**: Running into that more and more often.
**Gducharme**: Like ad even like redoing finishes.
**Gducharme**: Like we used to do restroom remodels and office buildings all the time and like.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, we're just putting fixtures back like for like.
**Gducharme**: And they were totally cool with that.
**Gducharme**: And then in the past couple years they've started to raise the alarm a little bit more.
**Gducharme**: Do you know your inspector for this area?
**Jdawson**: I don't, but here's my suggestion for that.
**Jdawson**: If you, if you do you have the.
**Jdawson**: Here, I'll stop sharing my screen.
**Jdawson**: Do you have the plans?
**Gducharme**: Yeah, I'll show that.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So let me get like this one.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Sure that that works.
**Jdawson**: I guess the idea that I would have there is we still keep the, the bathroom on the left that we're doing and if we are required to do an ada, what does that mean?
**Jdawson**: We just have to have a door, a 36 inch wide door.
**Gducharme**: I mean there's just like different clearances that we need and like this one on the right hand is just not getting there for any of them.
**Jdawson**: So if we have one, why would we have to have two if they're right next to each other?
**Jdawson**: Can we have like one handicap and one.
**Gducharme**: That is a great question, Glenn.
**Gducharme**: And that would be our ideal scenario too.
**Gducharme**: I'm just alerting you guys of this in the event that it comes up, if we want to like pre plan for it or if we want to, you know, just roll with this plan.
**Gducharme**: Like yeah, we're providing one.
**Gducharme**: We're actually making a situation better.
**Gducharme**: And then you know, maybe the conversation is like yeah, on this right hand side one.
**Gducharme**: Like there's sort of like this hardship that you can argue like it's going to be ridiculously.
**Gducharme**: You know.
**Jdawson**: What we have to do is lose the shower.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, we would have to like lose the shower would be lose the shower.
**Jdawson**: And just straight.
**Gducharme**: And then move everything.
**Jdawson**: Around, go into the slab and re tie stuff in which we don't want to do.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, hopefully.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: But if, if that's what their rule is.
**Jdawson**: I, I have no idea.
**Jdawson**: I haven't heard that.
**Jdawson**: I know we have to make something 88 accessible.
**Jdawson**: It's on the main floor.
**Jdawson**: Makes sense.
**Gducharme**: But yes.
**Jdawson**: Dude, is it highly likely that two people in wheelchairs really have to pee that bad at the same time?
**Gducharme**: Great question.
**Gducharme**: I know.
**Jdawson**: I.
**Jdawson**: What's handicap capacity is like 1 out of 75 or something?
**Gducharme**: Something like that?
**Gducharme**: This is.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, I feel like it's not really like we can argue it if we want to go down that path.
**Gducharme**: I'm just concerned that, like, we get our permit and they're like, in the field, they're like, you have to change this entire area.
**Jdawson**: Well, we would definitely ask during the permit process.
**Jdawson**: We could.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, something.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.
**Gducharme**: And just, like.
**Gducharme**: I mean, we do have, like, some factors around that I think helps our case.
**Gducharme**: Like, A, we're making this one better.
**Gducharme**: B, we have a stair over here.
**Gducharme**: Like, it's not that easy to just adjust this scenario.
**Gducharme**: Over here, an electrical panel.
**Gducharme**: And, like, so it's not like we're being lazy.
**Gducharme**: It's just, like, challenging to make it work over here.
**Gducharme**: So we could sort of.
**Gducharme**: Supposedly, there's one, like, right here.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, it's.
**Gducharme**: And then, like you said, I don't.
**Jdawson**: Think it's that close to the bathroom.
**Jdawson**: It's a little.
**Jdawson**: But somewhere there.
**Jdawson**: But it's also facing.
**Jdawson**: Right now it's facing the other way.
**Jdawson**: We're gonna flip it.
**Gducharme**: Oh, it's like, in this room.
**Jdawson**: It's in the.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, it's just in the main room.
**Jdawson**: It's in front of those double doors about halfway to the bathroom.
**Jdawson**: And we're gonna flip it so that it's inside that utility closet or whatever.
**Jdawson**: That room there next to the stairs.
**Jdawson**: Because that area, you can't get there unless you go outside and back in.
**Jdawson**: Right under the stairs.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, you can't get into that lobby unless you go in that single door there next to the double doors.
**Jdawson**: Or you go up to the second.
**Jdawson**: The first floor, walk across, and then you can go back down.
**Gducharme**: I see.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So they want to take that panel and hide it in that.
**Gducharme**: Hide it in there.
**Gducharme**: That makes sense.
**Jdawson**: But there's freaking electrical panels everywhere.
**Jdawson**: You saw.
**Jdawson**: Just in that storage room over there on the left.
**Gducharme**: Why not?
**Jdawson**: Panels everywhere.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Gducharme**: Okay, well, let me get this sort of, like, space plan drawn up at least on this left side.
**Gducharme**: And then what do you think about this right side?
**Gducharme**: Like, keep the course and you guys will talk to the inspector.
**Jdawson**: Keep the what?
**Gducharme**: Like, keep the course that we had sort of planned out.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, Basically, we're just.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: I was.
**Jdawson**: So I haven't worked with you, obviously, before, but you handle the permit drawing.
**Jdawson**: And do you have, like, expedited permit?
**Jdawson**: You send a perm, you.
**Jdawson**: You file the permit, or do we still file a permit?
**Jdawson**: What is the.
**Gducharme**: So it depends on the locality, but since we're.
**Gducharme**: This is an indie.
**Gducharme**: We can do the state filing and the city filing.
**Gducharme**: We typically always do the state one, but City we can do.
**Gducharme**: And then we can do the state expediting process as well.
**Gducharme**: The city doesn't really have.
**Jdawson**: Pretty quick.
**Acannon**: Yeah.
**Gducharme**: So I usually tell people, like, we have to do the initial filing, then we have to tell the state, like, hey, we're going to expedite.
**Gducharme**: They have to like open up their portal to let us pay for it.
**Gducharme**: Then I have to probably get on the phone with Jesse and we usually do like a credit card payment so we don't have to like deal with a check and all that stuff.
**Gducharme**: And then I feel like it's usually like another day or two before they release it.
**Gducharme**: So I feel like from like initial state permit filing to like, we have our release in hand with expediting, I say it's about like five business days.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: We're working with CDR right now on DHS Home CDRs too.
**Jdawson**: And they're.
**Jdawson**: They're responsive.
**Jdawson**: They help us out.
**Gducharme**: Good, good, good.
**Jdawson**: Pretty good to deal with.
**Jdawson**: And.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so that gets a cdr.
**Acannon**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: File or what is Indianapolis, Is it still an ILP or is it a building just called a building permit?
**Jdawson**: What are they doing?
**Gducharme**: Yeah, it's just like a building permit.
**Gducharme**: Theirs are called like strs.
**Gducharme**: We can file that if you want or you guys can file that directly with the city.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: It's just a convenience that we offer for people.
**Gducharme**: But I mean, you guys are going to get into the city permit eventually because you schedule your inspections and stuff through there.
**Gducharme**: So at a certain point we become like, hands off.
**Gducharme**: It's just some GCs prefer to just like do it from the get go.
**Gducharme**: But I don't think it really matters if you don't have a preference.
**Jdawson**: So I guess if it's Indy and ILP or building permit, whatever we're getting.
**Jdawson**: Do you have maybe an inspector you've worked with in your emails, you know, recently that you could hit up and just CC me and say, hey, got a question here.
**Gducharme**: I can ask around.
**Gducharme**: I personally don't do a ton of work in Broad Ripple, so I don't know who would be assigned to this area, but I can ask internally and see if anyone knows for sure.
**Jdawson**: You know, you don't.
**Jdawson**: You probably don't interact with inspectors a whole lot, do you?
**Gducharme**: No, we just hear the problems.
**Jdawson**: I don't know what I'm talking about.
**Jdawson**: Sorry.
**Gducharme**: No, you're fine.
**Jdawson**: Can you do any of my other job for me?
**Gducharme**: I have enough of my own things to do.
**Gducharme**: Glenn, come on.
**Jdawson**: Me too.
**Jdawson**: And I have an intern and a project engineer and A superintendent to help me pull the weight.
**Jdawson**: And they kind of do so much, so I'm relying on you.
**Gducharme**: All right, well, we like to be as helpful as we can, so we're working on it.
**Gducharme**: Well, get these.
**Gducharme**: We're working on these drawings.
**Gducharme**: So we'll just keep going, and then I'll let you know if anything else comes up before we chat on the 28th or 29th, whatever we landed on.
**Gducharme**: But we'll talk then and keep moving.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so next.
**Jdawson**: Next step is.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Meeting next week, dropping the permit into the city.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I have a.
**Jdawson**: I mean, I have a credit card, or Jesse can do his credit card.
**Jdawson**: That'll be Friday next week.
**Jdawson**: That'll take us into potentially Friday the following week to get a cdr.
**Jdawson**: In the meantime, we can still file with the city and have it ready to go.
**Jdawson**: And then they're just waiting on the CDR to release our permit.
**Gducharme**: Exactly.
**Acannon**: Yeah.
**Gducharme**: We'll file with city and stay at the same time.
**Gducharme**: And I feel like usually the city is, like, they're waiting on, like, the CDR and the GC authorization form or whatever, which I can send over to you to get signed to.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Isn't there an owner?
**Jdawson**: Owner, part owner has to sign each cdr.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, we'll have Andrew sign it.
**Gducharme**: He typically signs all the paperwork, so I'll have that ready to go for him.
**Gducharme**: And then.
**Gducharme**: Actually, I am forgetting, in Indianapolis, they have a new quote, unquote, expedite process that doesn't cost anything.
**Gducharme**: So maybe we try that first.
**Gducharme**: What do you guys have, like, a delivery date on this that Goodwill is pushing for yet?
**Gducharme**: Are you still building that out?
**Jdawson**: I have not given them a schedule yet.
**Jdawson**: I've been.
**Acannon**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: I gotta do a lot of stuff to catch up this week on this, but.
**Gducharme**: Okay, well, I will just send you an email recapping, and I'll tell you more about, like, that expediting process.
**Gducharme**: Basically, it's just an additional piece of paper that we file, and we're saying, like, hey, like, we're not changing the use of this space.
**Gducharme**: It's an interior remodel.
**Gducharme**: And if they accept it, they basically just do, like, a life safety review on the CDs.
**Gducharme**: They don't do, like, a full quote, unquote, full review.
**Gducharme**: Not that they're.
**Gducharme**: I don't think they're ever technically doing that, but it goes through faster.
**Gducharme**: I mean, I did, like, a 17,000 square foot space, and I had my release in two days, so.
**Gducharme**: So it could be.
**Gducharme**: I think we should try that first, see if it works.
**Gducharme**: And then worst case, we pay the expedite, which we were going to anyways, but then we saved $5,000, which everyone will like.
**Jdawson**: Did you guys, did you guys put your.
**Jdawson**: Per the.
**Jdawson**: Do the permitting in your.
**Jdawson**: In your contract costs or is it extra on top of that?
**Gducharme**: It is extra on top and I can send you.
**Acannon**: Go ahead.
**Jdawson**: We did pay for the expedited or we did do the expedited contract with you.
**Jdawson**: Yes, but you're.
**Jdawson**: But the permit part is still extra on top of that, you're saying.
**Acannon**: Exactly.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Gducharme**: And it's not that much for city and state.
**Gducharme**: It's like under a thousand dollars.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I mean, you know, still gotta get doors ordered or whatever.
**Jdawson**: We're gonna.
**Acannon**: For sure.
**Jdawson**: What do you.
**Jdawson**: When without pushing you too much, how quickly would you be able to at least get me like the, the call outs for some of the material that I'm gonna need to go for here?
**Jdawson**: Like the countertop.
**Gducharme**: I think that is a.
**Jdawson**: Doors.
**Jdawson**: You have like a nice French door that's going in there.
**Jdawson**: Something like that.
**Jdawson**: If, if I can get a jump start.
**Gducharme**: I mean all that general like, we'll sort of have design intent, our construction drawings.
**Gducharme**: So I feel like typically you just send that to your door guy and there we can, you know, look at.
**Acannon**: A submittal or whatever or suggestions.
**Jdawson**: So you're not going to spec out something necessarily.
**Jdawson**: We'll just.
**Jdawson**: You'll give me some design intent.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, exactly.
**Gducharme**: And then as far as finishes, I need to dig into that document you gave.
**Gducharme**: But it seemed like we're sort of keeping a lot of the finishes for the most part here and there.
**Gducharme**: I'm going to take that back, actually.
**Jdawson**: The building's empty.
**Jdawson**: There's nothing there.
**Jdawson**: We're putting carpet, tile on the first and second floor, polished concrete on the lower level, tearing up the tile in the bathroom on the lower level.
**Jdawson**: I want to pull the sink, pull the toilet, tear up the tile, polish concrete and remount the same fixtures back on.
**Jdawson**: The building's in pretty good condition.
**Jdawson**: I mean, I mean even the.
**Jdawson**: It seems it's pretty new in there.
**Jdawson**: Whatever.
**Jdawson**: Whatever they've done in there.
**Jdawson**: So just really some paint.
**Gducharme**: Do you know if Goodwill has any like standards that they want to use?
**Gducharme**: I mean, we've done their stores and Excel and stuff.
**Gducharme**: Like, I doubt they want to use.
**Gducharme**: They don't really use carpet.
**Jdawson**: Carpet squares or carpet tiles.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, we can like build out schemes is my point.
**Gducharme**: Like I could just put allowances for like that and the bathroom tile and stuff.
**Gducharme**: At least on the drawing, so it's a placeholder.
**Gducharme**: And then we can work on the finishes the following week after we get permits in.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I don't.
