## Transcript
**Accounting**: Hi, jc.
**Bclymer**: Hey.
**Fnjie**: Can you hear me?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, we can hear you.
**Accounting**: Hi.
**Accounting**: Hello.
**Fnjie**: All right, let's dive into it.
**Accounting**: So, guys, something for Brandon from accounting.
**Accounting**: From.
**Accounting**: You guys need.
**Fnjie**: Where are we at on the accounting calendar?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we have maybe.
**Jdawson**: We are preparing the.
**Jdawson**: All the information.
**Jdawson**: Information to be included with the deadlines.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, but we are checking on that.
**Fnjie**: All right, when do you think we can have that ready by?
**Jdawson**: Maybe today, Tomorrow.
**Fnjie**: Okay, perfect.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: And do we get the reconciliation automation thing figured out?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we have reconciliation for January, February, March and April.
**Jdawson**: And.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, so April it is completed.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, the reconciliation.
**Fnjie**: So were you able to automate it through the system or did you.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, at the end of the day we could upload the statement, which was our main trouble, in the format ofx, but we did.
**Fnjie**: Yeah, it worked.
**Justin**: Yes.
**Fnjie**: Beautiful.
**Fnjie**: That saves a lot of time.
**Fnjie**: Awesome.
**Fnjie**: Okay, what else?
**Fnjie**: What else?
**Fnjie**: We got any updates?
**Bclymer**: Did we.
**Bclymer**: Did we discuss the AP automation in Notion, Jose?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Jdawson**: We.
**Jdawson**: We were saying that at the end of the day we could upload the OFX statement, which was our main trouble.
**Jdawson**: But yeah, we.
**Jdawson**: The statement were uploaded into akumatica.
**Fnjie**: Okay, so that's for the reconciliation, right?
**Bclymer**: That's for the reconciliation, yeah.
**Bclymer**: So for accounts.
**Bclymer**: Accounts payable.
**Bclymer**: Jose was testing that to see if we can just, you know, route everything, put code in.
**Bclymer**: In Notion, and once we have that, just upload it in acumatica like we do the credit cards.
**Fnjie**: Yeah, and.
**Fnjie**: And so we.
**Fnjie**: We haven't solved that yet, correct?
**Fnjie**: We're working on that.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, still working.
**Jdawson**: Because we need to prepare some templates, but we need to work on that if.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I think Ashley can.
**Bclymer**: Can help us with that like she did with the credit cards.
**Bclymer**: We just email her the information and have her create the template.
**Fnjie**: Okay, so have we emailed her yet or.
**Fnjie**: No.
**Bclymer**: Not yet.
**Bclymer**: Right, Jose?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, not yet.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, not yet.
**Bclymer**: Email her today.
**Jmendez**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: I think we are ready to upload your Chase.
**Bclymer**: To add your Chase to Notion as well.
**Bclymer**: Your Chase credit card.
**Bclymer**: Would that make it easier for you?
**Fnjie**: That.
**Fnjie**: So we.
**Fnjie**: So we just got Maria a credit card, a capital one card.
**Fnjie**: And so that 7414 is getting phased out, like, so.
**Jmendez**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: Because most of that stuff is all like.
**Fnjie**: Like our storage unit is on there, like a few other like, old subscriptions that we've had for.
**Fnjie**: For years.
**Fnjie**: And so as soon as her card comes in, we're gonna move a lot of that stuff, cancel stuff that we don't need anymore.
**Fnjie**: And then that way it's.
**Fnjie**: It's all there.
**Fnjie**: And so we don't have to worry about a separate card.
**Jmendez**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: What about the American Express?
**Fnjie**: No, I mean, that's the same thing.
**Fnjie**: That, that doesn't get used very much at all.
**Fnjie**: Like, that's, that's again, nothing's tied to a subscription wise, like, you know, that's more of just a backup.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Fnjie**: Because we have no limit.
**Fnjie**: Like, you know, we can do whatever we need with it.
**Jmendez**: Okay.
**Accounting**: All right.
**Fnjie**: What else?
**Bclymer**: I was looking at the cash flow flow statement.
**Bclymer**: Let me see if I can pull.
**Accounting**: It up real quick.
**Fnjie**: Yeah, I was looking at that this morning.
**Fnjie**: Yeah, we're down to 250.
**Accounting**: Forecast.
**Jmendez**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: I was looking at the unclear checks and see if we need to chase any of those.
**Bclymer**: If there are some that are really.
**Fnjie**: Old to our receivables or payables.
**Bclymer**: Payables, yeah.
**Bclymer**: We have about 204,000 in checks that have been sent but not paid.
**Bclymer**: There's one from July 2023 for $10,000, you know, to Sunrise Business, Business.
**Accounting**: Solutions.
**Fnjie**: I thought that I already.
**Fnjie**: Yeah, avoid that.
**Jmendez**: Okay.
**Jmendez**: All right.
**Bclymer**: And we have quite a few from March 2024, June 2024.
**Bclymer**: Those are small.
**Bclymer**: So what we can do is we can see if they were job related and send it back to the PMs.
**Bclymer**: And you know, if they want us to void and reissue, we can.
**Bclymer**: If they say just void, we can just void.
**Fnjie**: Okay, perfect.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: The rest of them are recent.
**Jmendez**: I.
**Bclymer**: Think 2024 accounts for about $16,000.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: Yeah, we'll go ahead and.
**Fnjie**: I said void the 10,000 and the other stuff.
**Jmendez**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Anything else for us?
**Bclymer**: Anything you need from our end.
**Fnjie**: You know, that's the main thing.
**Fnjie**: You know, let's be cognizant.
**Fnjie**: Obviously, like we've got, you know, Westfield.
**Fnjie**: I talked to the owner.
**Fnjie**: They're working through some bank financing stuff.
**Fnjie**: We know that they're a big chunk of money that they owe us.
**Fnjie**: So let's just be, you know, cautious about writing stuff at the end of this month, you know, for that job until we've gotten paid.
**Fnjie**: Like, I don't want to overwrite the account.
**Jmendez**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: Now I think we've got around 6 or 800,000 coming in outside of them.
**Fnjie**: So.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah, AR is pretty.
**Bclymer**: It's like over 2 million owed.
**Accounting**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: What job was that?
**Fnjie**: So The Westfield collective, job 24, I think it's 24.
**Fnjie**: 11 4.
**Fnjie**: That, that one they have, you know, it's I beach on the ar, I think is what it's called out as they have pretty big B.
**Accounting**: We also got an approval from UNIQLO the invoice that we entered into Coupa Portal.
**Fnjie**: Yeah, it's not, it's not due yet.
**Fnjie**: Right.
**Accounting**: I think end of the month.
**Fnjie**: Yeah.
**Fnjie**: Yeah.
**Fnjie**: So I've got a meeting with them today.
**Fnjie**: So.
**Bclymer**: The one we were looking at yesterday.
**Bclymer**: The one.
**Accounting**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Were they able to help with the invoicing how the address?
**Accounting**: Actually, it was approved.
**Accounting**: I was surprised as well that it was approved.
**Accounting**: I.
**Accounting**: I received an email notification.
**Accounting**: Then I checked the invoice in Pupa.
**Fnjie**: Yeah, the.
**Fnjie**: The Uniqlo one was approved in Coupa.
**Accounting**: Yes.
**Fnjie**: Ah, that's good news.
**Jmendez**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: Hey.
**Bclymer**: Hey, Jesse, if you're available this week, let's.
**Bclymer**: Let's get together and talk about the AR billing, you know, the deadlines and stuff, how we can start sending notifications.
**Justin**: Yeah, yeah, good.
**Justin**: I would have you just sent a notification out by the 25th if, if there's any subcontractor billings that aren't approved that the PMs need to get them done.
**Jmendez**: Okay.
**Justin**: And then by the first, they should have their owner billing sent to you.
**Justin**: If the first falls on a weekend, then the Friday before they need to have.
**Jmendez**: Okay.
**Accounting**: Yeah.
**Justin**: I just talked to Ronnie with Aspire and he said he told him last week to pay that all of our invoices that were outstanding.
**Jmendez**: Okay.
**Justin**: With his pay app.
**Justin**: So he said he's going to call and check and see where that's at.
**Jmendez**: Okay.
**Justin**: But they just asked us to go do another job for him today, so.
**Fnjie**: Okay, Maria, so, you know, as we're working with these, you know, automatic emails and all this reminder stuff, you know, why don't you look into, you know, how we can utilize, you know, some automation and AI to, To get those things sent out so that it's not relying on somebody remembering to do it.
**Accounting**: Okay, I'll check.
**Justin**: Is that able?
**Justin**: Is.
**Justin**: Is there a way that it can access like job planner procore?
**Justin**: Not so much.
**Justin**: And just see, that'd be cool if they could just check through the modules and.
**Fnjie**: Yeah, yeah, there's a way to do it.
**Fnjie**: Just got to code it.
**Fnjie**: Like, you know, like build the code to go in and say, hey, you know, look through blah, blah, blah.
**Fnjie**: Yeah, it's a little bit more advanced than what I know about.
**Fnjie**: We'd have to, you know, bring in somebody and, you know, try to figure that out.
**Fnjie**: Which, you know, I typically.
**Fnjie**: The way that I've.
**Fnjie**: The way that I approach something like this is let's get a standard in place like what we're doing, right.
**Fnjie**: Just like how we code stuff, all that stuff and once we get the system in place that we're doing, how do we automate it?
**Fnjie**: You know?
**Fnjie**: So I think if we can get a structure and a system in place, first of, like, all right, here's what we're doing, then we could say, all right, how can we apply technology to streamline this?
**Jmendez**: Okay, you code?
**Bclymer**: Do you code, Brandon?
**Fnjie**: Do I code?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Fnjie**: Oh, I mean, I.
**Fnjie**: I just taught myself, like, using chat gbt, and so I was creating, like, I.
**Fnjie**: Creating, like I was playing to create a little alito AI, you know, So I just, you know, I put in some data, like, try to making it to notion and stuff.
**Fnjie**: I.
**Fnjie**: You know, it's nothing crazy by any means.
**Fnjie**: It's just enough to understand how it works.
**Bclymer**: Wow.
**Jmendez**: Impressive.
**Fnjie**: Yeah, that's me.
**Jmendez**: Yeah, that's pretty cool.
**Justin**: I've had a cold before thanks to it.
**Accounting**: Fatima, did we create a cost code for the recruitment.
**Bclymer**: Costco, like a job Costco?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, or a gl.
**Bclymer**: I created a gl.
**Bclymer**: Is this about that.
**Bclymer**: The cybercoders invoice?
**Jmendez**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So, Jesse, did you want to create a Costco like a recruiting Costco?
**Bclymer**: Because here's what I was going to ask you guys.
**Bclymer**: So, Brandon, is.
**Bclymer**: Is Keval going to be working on multiple jobs, or do we want to charge his recruiting to one job?
**Bclymer**: If he's going to be working on multiple jobs, I would suggest we put it to the GL and allocate it.
**Fnjie**: So, yes, he's going to be working to multiple jobs.
**Fnjie**: However, like I would say, instead of hitting gl, let's hit, like, code it to Uniqlo because that's where he's assigned.
**Jmendez**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: Jesse, what do you think?
**Justin**: Are you saying rpms have to code all their time each week to one job?
**Fnjie**: No, no, no, no.
**Fnjie**: We're talking about the recruiting fee for Keba.
**Justin**: Oh, for that?
**Justin**: Yeah, I was just going to charge it to Uniqlo.
**Fnjie**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Oh, okay.
**Bclymer**: So the.
**Bclymer**: The cost code you.
**Bclymer**: You gave us, the label code would not work because it's an invoice.
**Bclymer**: We couldn't hit that.
**Bclymer**: So if you don't mind, just create another recruiting.
**Justin**: I thought I created expense code in there.
**Bclymer**: Maybe you did.
**Justin**: Yeah, there's an expense code.
**Bclymer**: Okay, what's the number?
**Justin**: Well, it's the same.
**Justin**: 013128.
**Justin**: But it's just expense instead of labor code.
**Jmendez**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right, so just use.
**Bclymer**: Use that one for T.
**Bclymer**: If we add the accounting calendar to notion, is it going to send out notifications when stuff?
**Fnjie**: I'm not sure that's something.
**Fnjie**: Maria is going to work with.
**Accounting**: Yeah, so I thought.
**Accounting**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: So I thought, Fritzi, how to send the reminders for you guys and how to tag people and everything.
**Accounting**: So it should be able to do it.
**Jmendez**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Can we add it to the Outlook calendar?
**Bclymer**: Like, certain important dates, like when we get the AR stuff.
**Bclymer**: Can we add it to the Outlook calendar to where everybody can see on their calendar this is due on this date?
**Fnjie**: Yeah.
**Fnjie**: Maria, you can probably create a master Alito calendar in Outlook that everybody has access to, and then you can just add the stuff to that.
**Jmendez**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: And that.
**Fnjie**: That way it not only has that, like, you know, whatever.
**Fnjie**: Right.
**Fnjie**: Date.
**Fnjie**: Like, we can put, like, holidays off, you know, like, show, like, you know, we're, you know, you know, companies close this day, this day, all that kind of stuff.
**Jmendez**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: Birthdays, whatever stuff.
**Accounting**: Yeah.
**Fnjie**: Anything else?
**Bclymer**: Not on my end.
**Fnjie**: Awesome.
**Fnjie**: Jesse, got anything?
**Justin**: I don't think so.
**Fnjie**: Awesome.
**Fnjie**: Thanks, everybody.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Accounting**: Thank you.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Thank you.
