## Transcript

**Jesse Remillard:**
Oh, okay. Somebody. Somebody had a note taker in there and it wasn't ours. So I just didn't want to have our meeting on somebody else's notes. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Amen. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
So I talked to Andrew this morning through everything, and it sounds like he's. Guys have everything lined out. You know, it needs be done. And then Jesse is working feverishly on the end with the design with the city. Yes. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Because just to reiterate again, I mean, we're. We're shooting up some prayers that once that does get approved, that when it comes to then scheduling with the city planning department to come back out that there's quick availability for them to come. I was hoping, like we said, to try to lightly pencil us in so that we could while slot. While their slots are getting taken up really fast and getting full that we could. We could try to get on there. I would love to still do that next week if maybe I. Maybe. Maybe we've made enough progress according to like Jennifer's like her made progress scale about trying to get on to lightly penciling us in. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
I'm just worried that there's no lightly penciling with inspections. We either schedule it or we don't. So what Andrew was going to work on, and he still is, is just putting together everything we need to do because we need to tco everything but that loading dock area. So if we need to put fence panels up in front of that trench where the curb goes or whatever we need to do. 

**Jack Curtin:**
They said they'd do that tomorrow, didn't they? 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Yes. 

**Jack Curtin:**
70% sure they'll do that tomorrow. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Curb at the latest will be done Monday. Okay, random question. So there's guys here putting up Goodwill logos at the front of the building. Has there been any direction on the exact location for the Goodwill logo on. By the canopy? 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yeah, it's supposed to go right in between the canopy and that first row of windows I got. They should Nick sent them an elevation of where to put it. Are they. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
They don't know is for a different building. Oh, geez. It's a building it's coming from. There's they can figure there if we. If it's on our responsibility to tell them where to put it, we can get that for them. But I. I didn't know if that was Goodwill direction. That's Goodwill direction. That's one less thing we'll have to deal with. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Good question. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
We got time. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yeah. So it's not like they need it right now. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
And they're gonna put. They're putting the address at the front of the building. Oh, perfect. 

**Jack Curtin:**
So they're going to go ahead and. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Take care of that for us. It's nine. What, what is the digits? 

**Jack Curtin:**
2811. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
2811. Yeah. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yeah. So, Jesse, I mean, what, what I'm, what I'm worried about is if we come, we. Everything is ready for a TCO on Tuesday. And then the city planning department tells us we don't even have anything available to walk with you on Tuesday. Like that's what. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Yeah, that's why we need to figure everything out today. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yeah. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
You know, and then go over everything. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Because if we can figure out everything today, then Jesse should have answers for us for the design end. 

**Jack Curtin:**
And then we get everything else. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Yeah, well, yeah, and then we can call today, hopefully, and schedule the inspection. Because the sooner we call it, the sooner we're going to have a better chance of getting it. 

**Jack Curtin:**
If they allow. If. Yeah, I mean, I don't, I don't. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Well, here's. Well, I know, but here's, here's kind of why that end is so important, because that temporary use permit is a big deal and we're trying to get the COI over to that guy to finalize that permit, and they won't let us do anything like her email said, until that's in. And then the drawings, like for the handicap spaces. Yeah, that's all resolved. And so. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Okay, so the whole parking situation. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Yes. Kim Lee Horn is working with Jennifer at pnz, I believe, directly getting all that resolved. So when that stuff is cleared up, I'm pretty sure we can call and schedule the inspection because the rest of the stuff is all field actions. 

**Jack Curtin:**
That's what I'm getting at is all of the things that Jesse Dawson is pushing through Kimley Horn and the city is because the building department is basically just like, hey, yeah, I mean, give us a shout when you think you're going to be ready again and we'll schedule you. But it was the planning department that was like, we won't even look into scheduling you until all the handicap situation and all that stuff that Jesse's working on. That's, that's the part of trying to get on their schedule to come out is that is what I'm worried about. So we can, we can get all the field stuff. Like, we're looking really good. We'll run through all this stuff that Andrew's put down in sections on this, on this project schedule. But even the building department and the fire marshal said that they can't even issue a tco. Until the planning department approves of everything. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Well, that's what Jesse's working on right now. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yeah. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Yeah. So that's what I would say in the book. We need that stuff to be submitted. Reviewed cities, happy. Then we'll probably be able to get our inspection scheduled. Gotcha. Yeah. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yes, we will. As long as that's all submitted, approved, and everything. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Okay. 

**Jack Curtin:**
All right. So do you want to run through the certain. All these areas in the field that we got jotted down? 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Yeah. 

**Jack Curtin:**
All right, so for donation, canopy plywood swap today, the fourth EFIS install, they're working on that. On the ceiling part of it. They'll finish the ceiling part of it today, and then they're going to be wrapping the columns tomorrow morning. The columns will be done. Everything done. Done by tomorrow at noon. Then the electrician is then going to start trimming out the ceiling in there tomorrow. We can officially paint everything come Saturday the 6th. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
And the painter, the electrician will have his lights in Monday or Friday. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yeah, tomorrow. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Yeah. And then. Yeah, if anything, we'll need painters here Saturday. Yeah, painters. Call them. So then gutters and downspouts can be done Monday. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Monday. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Yeah. Or if they leave paint here, we can paint it on Saturday. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Okay. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
So. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Then fire suppression Friday, canopy vestibule swap head and break room 110. Friday swap head in office 108. Friday, restroom adding tile for the sprinkler heads on Friday. And the fire and the testing that needs to take place to be able to get our fire sprinkler certificate will take place on Friday as well. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Yeah, And Trey said he's looking into that certificate because he's pretty sure that it already exists. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yeah. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
So. Okay. Yeah, because his thing, and he's checking with Sean at Siemens with it, is because we're not making a new above ground system which should already be certified. We're just adding to it. He believes that documentation should already be available. Okay. So he's checking into that. And he's going to get back with us today. I would. I would ping him because it's already 8, 9, 10, 11 your time. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Okay. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Jack, I would ask him if he's. Yeah. Yep. 

**Jack Curtin:**
So we'll. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
We'll. 

**Jack Curtin:**
We'll get in touch with him as soon as this meeting's over. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Okay. 

**Jack Curtin:**
All right, so then jump in to csc. Fire alarm. They're. They're. Foreman Cole told me yesterday they'll have their fire alarm certificate by close of business today. As of right now, all fire alarm is done and tested. Right now they're installing some Security cameras. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
And that's Goodwill people, right? Yep. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Goodwill people. They're working on it today. What's that? 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Are they going to address that line? You zip tied up an office 108 ceiling. 

**Jack Curtin:**
That one's. It's not a security wire. That one's a speaker wire. And that's. Yeah, that vendor told Andrew that. Andrew Mulder. That he'll be. They'll be out either tomorrow or no later than Monday. But regardless, we'll still make sure it's zip tied above the ceiling tile. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Dropped. Okay. I tried calling Easy Access to get an updated shipment date for the pieces. No answer. I left a voicemail. I'm going to keep calling them until we find that out. Say that again, Andrew. Easy access for the railing. I'm trying to figure out a confirmed delivery date. No one's answered today, so I keep trying until I get that. Okay. I think worst case, it's here Tuesday. Yeah. And on the phone, the guy was talking like he could overnight it, so I don't know. That's. I wasn't on the conversation after that, but yeah. See if he can find that out and let us know when that stuff's going to be here. Yep. Other than that, I mean, we. I think other than that, it's really just making sure there's no. We gotta get all. Any loose material off site that the city planner would dig us for in the inspection. Okay. So are you guys still running around like. Are you guys running around like crazy today, or is it pretty much just monitoring, making sure everything's getting done? 

**Jack Curtin:**
This morning was a little crazy. Running around, following up with everybody, then getting it all organized so that we could, you know, be able to relay the information. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Yeah, really? Just checking with everyone on site what they were doing today, and then what they have left out here, applying that into notes, and then now putting it into a schedule. Okay, one second. So, really, the only major things left that we have on this certificate of inspection that we'll focus on right now we get answers for is we need to figure out when those railing pieces are going to come for the ramp. Do we need to secure it to the ground? Other than that, figure out what this note for. Update extra sprinkler heads and riser room. Do we need to see that note today? Update extra sprinkler heads. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yeah. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Do we need one in there? 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yeah. The. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
What's that called? 

**Jack Curtin:**
Jesse R. What's. What's that box called that you have extra sprinkler heads that match the existing ones in the building that you keep in a riser room. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Attic. Attic stock. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Attic stock, yeah. Trey, Trey, Trey. I told Trey to bring extra attic stock. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
That's good then. We'll verify smoke detectors today, verify the ramp needs to screw to the ground on handrail date, Fire alarm. Good. Identification? Dom got nicer. And vessel done. Good. Everything on this list that they have written down will be done tomorrow. Other than the canopy area. Not sure if you're able to hear that, Junior. Yep, I got you. Yeah, everything should be done by tomorrow on our end on this screen sheet. Other than the canopy area, which should be done Monday. Okay. Yeah, just get the schedule locked in for that canopy. Yep. Because we need to. Yeah, we need to dial that in to know if it's going to be done by lunch or not. So plywood's done. EFIs will be done. Done Friday. Lights will be done Friday. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Painting it starts Saturday. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Get the painters here Saturday. Gutters and downspouts will be the first priority for the roofers on Monday. And the roofers I already talked to today confirmed that they can have that done Monday. So I see. If anything it's. How long will it take them to get. It's just two downspouts on two columns and I don't know how much gutter, but. Yeah, and I would assume they're going to bend it on site, so it's usually pretty quick. Yeah. They're coming out today to field measure and verify. Yeah, I would just ask them. They know how. How long they think they're going to take. I would guess for that much work it'd be like two, three hours. Well, after looking at all that, I see no issue. If we're very lucky, we could get the TCO end of day Monday. I feel good about. 

**Jack Curtin:**
We'd have to do a. Like a. A Monday evening inspection. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Correct. So. Well, yeah. And I think grinding on the schedule and document stuff out and then maybe do a meeting here in three hours on everything. Yep. Just send me an invite. Let's see. I've been holding this since 6am I'm. I gotta go. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yeah. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
If you send me one for ten. Go ahead, Andrew. Good luck. I got Turtle peeking right now. If you send me an invite for 2 o' clock your time. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Sounds good. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
I'm open either during lunch or two o'. Clock. I got meetings otherwise. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yeah, let's do two. That sounds great. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Okay. And then for this, loading dock lights. I'll see what I can get. Just keep an eye on your phone because they may have field questions. I can't answer. So I'll get a hold of you guys. Okay. And then. Yeah, yeah, 2811. 

**Jack Curtin:**
It's on that building permit right there on the right. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Are you back? 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yeah, I'm back. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Okay. Yeah, just know that I got to call Andrew today and update him, so I'll probably do that right after our two o' clock meeting. So. Yeah, just bring an update to that, if you would, please. We all do. All right, man. Good luck. Call me if you need anything in the meantime. Thank you. 

**Jack Curtin:**
I appreciate it. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
All right. Yep. See ya.
