## Transcript
**Aelkarrimy**: Hi, Jesse.
**Aelkarrimy**: Hey, Kevin.
**Bclymer**: Mike.
**Bclymer**: Hey, man.
**Jdawson**: How we doing?
**Kevin.ly**: Well.
**Mparsons**: Doing well, guys.
**Mparsons**: How are you?
**Bclymer**: Good.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: How you doing?
**Bclymer**: What's up, Tilly?
**Jdawson**: Kev is supposedly sick, but other than that, we're all fine.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Same here, Kevo.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: My daughter got me sick.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: She has foot, head, mouth, whatever it is, disease.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So now I have to stay home, and she's crying a storm, and I'm running up and down the stairs like crazy today.
**Bclymer**: Wow.
**Bclymer**: I feel sorry for people, honestly, on that.
**Bryan.wagar**: I think you got to be in the office.
**Bryan.wagar**: AC is so nice there.
**Bryan.wagar**: I don't know if you guys know, but it's.
**Bryan.wagar**: There's like a heat wave in New York right now.
**Bclymer**: It's terrible.
**Bclymer**: Really?
**Bschwartz**: No, I.
**Jdawson**: 110, but you can't tell the difference.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah.
**Bryan.wagar**: My dad sent me a screenshot today.
**Bryan.wagar**: 113, real feel.
**Bryan.wagar**: I was like, whoa.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bryan.wagar**: Real feel here is 92.
**Bryan.wagar**: But feels worse than that.
**Jdawson**: In New York, it's 113.
**Bryan.wagar**: No, that wasn't.
**Bryan.wagar**: That's in Florida.
**Bryan.wagar**: But I think it, like, early this afternoon.
**Bryan.wagar**: It probably hit, like, 100.
**Bryan.wagar**: It was hot.
**Mparsons**: Oh, I have to open it first.
**Kevin.ly**: And then down there.
**Mparsons**: Gotcha.
**Mparsons**: Running a little late due to him.
**Kevin.ly**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: So he's going to join a little later.
**Jdawson**: Are we waiting for anybody?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I think we could get started.
**Kevin.ly**: Okay.
**Kevin.ly**: We don't have.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Are we waiting for anyone else, Yusuke.
**Kevin.ly**: Or are we good to start?
**Aelkarrimy**: No, we're good to start.
**Mparsons**: Sounds good.
**Kevin.ly**: All right.
**Kevin.ly**: Gonna share my screen, Mike.
**Kevin.ly**: You can get started with the few stuff.
**Bschwartz**: All right.
**Bschwartz**: Yeah.
**Bschwartz**: So on site, our electrical team, they're continuing the installation of the feeders today.
**Bschwartz**: They wired up the junction box above the HE1 panel, and they are now prepared to start running their feeders to the confirmed transformer locations and drop stations.
**Bclymer**: And we.
**Bschwartz**: We got confirmation from Ted that we can start on Tuesday going into the sub tenant space.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Kevin.ly**: So, Mike, we.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Aelkarrimy**: Got detailed schedule.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Bschwartz**: So we have Tuesday to Thursday to be in their space with the lift.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Kevin.ly**: Thank you.
**Aelkarrimy**: No concern on that.
**Bschwartz**: No.
**Bschwartz**: I asked Ted for Monday, and he said Tuesday to Thursday, and I said that would work.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Aelkarrimy**: So next.
**Aelkarrimy**: Next Tuesday to Thursday or this Tuesday to Thursday?
**Bschwartz**: This upcoming Tuesday to Thursday, August 5th.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bschwartz**: And we've had our plumbing team on site.
**Bschwartz**: They completed the connection of the vent pipe to the existing lift station.
**Kevin.ly**: So.
**Bschwartz**: So we have final inspection scheduled for tomorrow.
**Bschwartz**: And that's.
**Bschwartz**: And then exotech's been on site.
**Bschwartz**: They've been continuing getting their material unloaded and on site.
**Jdawson**: When are they pouring that slab back to the trench?
**Bschwartz**: We're looking at Monday.
**Bclymer**: Monday.
**Bclymer**: And then.
**Bschwartz**: Is there any other questions as far as on site?
**Cheryl.green**: This is Brian from Henderson.
**Cheryl.green**: Sorry, I think I might have missed last week.
**Cheryl.green**: What.
**Cheryl.green**: What was the lift station for?
**Cheryl.green**: Plumbing the existing lift station.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bschwartz**: They connected the vent pipe for the separator.
**Cheryl.green**: Oh, for the oil water separator.
**Kevin.ly**: Okay.
**Cheryl.green**: Awesome.
**Jdawson**: Yes, yes, the waste pipe.
**Bclymer**: But.
**Jdawson**: That was a true gem to find because, remember, the first plan had us running all the way across and doing all kinds of crazy stuff to drain those things.
**Jdawson**: So that worked out good.
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah.
**Kevin.ly**: I sent some pictures last.
**Kevin.ly**: Last Friday.
**Kevin.ly**: The audience, I think they did a great job.
**Kevin.ly**: It looks really good.
**Kevin.ly**: So for the project schedule last week or Friday, I had a meeting with Exotech and our installer, our sprinkler installer, and we were able to make adjustments to accommodate for the delay from exotech.
**Kevin.ly**: So we were able to push the exotic start date.
**Kevin.ly**: And the finish date is still the same, but they're starting a bit, a bit later.
**Kevin.ly**: So they might be working Saturdays to catch up.
**Kevin.ly**: And it doesn't really affect our installation much, so we basically delayed that for one week.
**Kevin.ly**: And what they would do is they would try to finish the main installations and then once Exotic gets in with the racking installed, they can go ahead and work together there for, I guess for the electrical.
**Kevin.ly**: That is still pending the decision on the transformers.
**Kevin.ly**: So I don't know if we have any updates on that today.
**Mparsons**: Yeah, same update.
**Mparsons**: Kiva, you hit the nail on the head again.
**Mparsons**: We're hoping it's the same meeting as last Thursday.
**Mparsons**: That's tomorrow.
**Mparsons**: I believe we have a solution.
**Mparsons**: I think.
**Mparsons**: I think it's all just going to come down to price and who's going.
**Bclymer**: To pay.
**Mparsons**: But we will not.
**Mparsons**: I saw in your email there is a date that keeps the price the same.
**Mparsons**: I understand the timeline completely, but we will.
**Mparsons**: We will not be exceeding that date, that is for sure.
**Kevin.ly**: Well, so, I mean, for pricing, it might still not go up, but the more we keep pushing it, it might affect the overall schedule at this point.
**Bclymer**: No, I.
**Mparsons**: For sure, for sure.
**Mparsons**: We're going to have to.
**Mparsons**: Once you know, whichever direction we choose, which is most likely going to be the option to the 480 everywhere.
**Mparsons**: But you still need to order breakers.
**Mparsons**: And once we find out when the breakers will come in, I think that'll definitely be.
**Mparsons**: That is definitely going to be a discussion between you and I about.
**Mparsons**: About when the power can be turned on for that section.
**Mparsons**: So with that we can still turn.
**Mparsons**: Can we still turn the power on for the sections that can be done and.
**Mparsons**: Or do these breakers affect that as well?
**Jdawson**: They would have to knock out, tag out.
**Jdawson**: You know, if they energize a panel as long as they have, you know, safed off the breakers that can't be turned on.
**Jdawson**: And then you may have to do a shutdown when they go to install the other breakers.
**Jdawson**: If that's what you're trying.
**Jdawson**: If you want to energize some of it before all of its correct oils and breakers come in and that.
**Mparsons**: And that's nothing new.
**Mparsons**: Yeah, we would definitely do lockout tag out and we would not want anybody working on the electric wallets on.
**Bclymer**: For.
**Mparsons**: For sure.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Joe, did the transformer locations change at all?
**Mparsons**: The locations have changed now.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: No locations have changed.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So is it.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So myself and you, sugar, we were just talking on Monday and we were.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: We were trying to see how we can continue running everything that we need to all the way up to close to the area, but then not continuing any elbows until we understand the approximate location of the transformer before it all drops down.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Is the plan to keep running everything to the approximate locations or are we on pause until the transformer decision is made?
**Kevin.ly**: Unless.
**Mparsons**: Unless that change.
**Mparsons**: Unless that changes the cable that's run.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So it does affect the cabling.
**Kevin.ly**: Yes.
**Kevin.ly**: For the transformers that we are changing, it is going to affect the cabling.
**Kevin.ly**: But if we are sticking, if the ones that are not changed, if those are staying the same, we can go ahead and run wires to those for now.
**Jdawson**: And just because this is starting to get a little bit.
**Jdawson**: I don't want to become confusing.
**Jdawson**: And then we install something and it's the wrong one.
**Jdawson**: So just.
**Jdawson**: I would like something, someone like we're gonna put this one in and this one in and this one in and it's not going to change.
**Jdawson**: Or you guys tell us like these ones here are not going to change at all and then we can give clear direction to our electrician.
**Jdawson**: Hey, put these in.
**Jdawson**: You're good to go.
**Bclymer**: I just don't want it to be.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: That something that your team can put together quick just as a markup.
**Mparsons**: Yeah, I thought we already sent that out.
**Mparsons**: Everything on the north side, the power, you know, is not going to change that one.
**Bryan.wagar**: Right.
**Mparsons**: Look, locations are not going to change anywhere.
**Bclymer**: Let's.
**Mparsons**: Let's throw that out there.
**Mparsons**: Locations are not going to change, but the power is.
**Mparsons**: Everything we're deciding is all on the south side of this.
**Mparsons**: So I thought we did send that out in an email.
**Mparsons**: If not, I will get that clarified to let you know.
**Mparsons**: Again, these power dimensions for X, Y and Z are not.
**Mparsons**: Yeah, here you go.
**Mparsons**: Will not change.
**Kevin.ly**: So these is this.
**Kevin.ly**: This is your final custom.
**Mparsons**: So you can wire those.
**Mparsons**: That's what.
**Mparsons**: That's what I was asking earlier is okay, do the breakers that need to be ordered affect these ones to say, even if the south side isn't complete, we can.
**Mparsons**: We can still energize those beforehand.
**Cheryl.green**: I think Jesse alluded to it.
**Cheryl.green**: But when those new breakers come in, that panel would need to be.
**Cheryl.green**: The main panel would need to be shut down to change out those breakers.
**Cheryl.green**: So we could probably energize those three transformers for a portion of time and to do some commissioning until they need to do a shutdown to replace those breakers and install the feeders for the stuff up front.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Mparsons**: And that's.
**Mparsons**: That's exactly what I was hoping to hear.
**Mparsons**: Now I completely understand.
**Bclymer**: That's all.
**Mparsons**: I'm just.
**Aelkarrimy**: I'm trying to.
**Mparsons**: I'm trying to think of the schedule.
**Bclymer**: And.
**Mparsons**: And right now the breakers have gone from, I think, eight to 12 weeks to 10 to 16 weeks.
**Mparsons**: So I just want to make sure if, you know, 16 weeks from now, like, worst case scenario, they come in 16 weeks later, you know, we can still start commissioning before those come in for the rest of it.
**Cheryl.green**: Kevin, Jesse, what's the lead time right now on transformers?
**Bclymer**: That's the same.
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah.
**Kevin.ly**: 10 to 16.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Cheryl.green**: At least that's.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: No, because it was eight.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: It was eight to 10 weeks or eight to 12 weeks last week.
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah.
**Kevin.ly**: We.
**Kevin.ly**: We spoke with the electrician this morning and they took the lead.
**Kevin.ly**: Times are going up and he was citing the.
**Kevin.ly**: The copper price and.
**Mparsons**: Open the 16 week late.
**Mparsons**: I'm hoping the.
**Mparsons**: The longer lead time is for the transformers and not the breakers, but I'm always.
**Mparsons**: I'm gonna prepare for worst case scenario.
**Jdawson**: It was crazy when we talked in the first time.
**Jdawson**: You can get the full panel quicker than you can get the breakers.
**Jdawson**: So he's like, if it's a rush, we just order a new panel and get it here quicker.
**Jdawson**: But that's obviously expensive.
**Cheryl.green**: It's quite the expedite expedited cost.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Kevin.ly**: All right.
**Kevin.ly**: For the open change orders.
**Kevin.ly**: Wheel well, we still have the transformer change orders not approved and insurance change order.
**Kevin.ly**: I think we're still waiting on backups for that to be approved by Kevin.
**Bclymer**: Noted.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Kevin, you're on the call.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Do you have a status on that change order?
**Daisuke.mine**: Just the insurance one, right?
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yes, sir.
**Daisuke.mine**: No updates yet?
**Daisuke.mine**: No, the.
**Daisuke.mine**: My insurance team is checking in with Aliyato's broker.
**Daisuke.mine**: So let me send another message to see if they connected.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, let us know if they have any trouble getting in touch with them.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And then Mike and Keba, now that we're installing and running cables along the perimeter walls and whatnot, are there any special inspections that are required at this time?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Because we do have a.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: We do have a special inspection agency onboarded for like the miscellaneous anchors and whatnot.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So what I'll do is I'll send you a list of the inspections that cross check needs to fulfill and then you just let us know when you need.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: You could put a schedule together of like when you will need to schedule those miscellaneous inspections.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: This way we just give them a heads up so they plan it according accordingly during the year.
**Kevin.ly**: Okay.
**Kevin.ly**: All right, that would be good.
**Kevin.ly**: If you can send that over.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: No, I got you.
**Bclymer**: I'll.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I'll put that together for you today.
**Mparsons**: Or tomorrow, the latest.
**Kevin.ly**: Okay.
**Kevin.ly**: Does anyone else have anything to add?
**Kevin.ly**: Is okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: As of now?
**Aelkarrimy**: No, no, thank you.
**Aelkarrimy**: I don't have anything.
**Kevin.ly**: Okay.
**Kevin.ly**: Br.
**Cheryl.green**: No, nothing new, I think.
**Cheryl.green**: Keba, I sent the updated fire sprinkler exhibit out earlier this afternoon.
**Cheryl.green**: Did you get that?
**Kevin.ly**: Yes, I saw that.
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah.
**Kevin.ly**: That was a productive meeting we had today.
**Kevin.ly**: And so Chris has those.
**Kevin.ly**: So he's updating his fabrication drawings and then we will move on from there.
**Aelkarrimy**: Oh, sorry.
**Aelkarrimy**: Sorry.
**Aelkarrimy**: Ted, do you have any.
**Aelkarrimy**: Any concern on anything?
**Mparsons**: No, no, all good here.
**Bclymer**: Everything's working on fine.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay, thank you.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Cpgs and thank you guys.
**Kevin.ly**: All right, thank you, everyone.
**Bclymer**: Thanks, everybody.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Thanks, everyone.
**Bclymer**: Thank you.
**Bclymer**: Have a good one.
**Aelkarrimy**: Joe, you wanted to.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, if we can.
**Mparsons**: If we can have heart.
**Mparsons**: Our talk because I am meeting with.
**Mparsons**: Actually a meeting with the Japan team.
**Mparsons**: The exotech Japan team.
**Mparsons**: And 10 minutes, if that's okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: You still got to do any TPG on this call.
**Cheryl.green**: Today.
**Aelkarrimy**: It's okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: You can leave.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay, thank you guys.
**Jdawson**: I'll take off Fireflies and I'll see you guys later.
