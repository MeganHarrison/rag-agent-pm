## Transcript
**Jdawson**: What's up, Jesse?
**Speaker 1**: Morning.
**Jdawson**: You could sleep into 6:30 now.
**Jdawson**: That's why I did that.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, I was already talking to Brandon at 5.
**Speaker 1**: I had my face covered in ultrasound jelly yesterday and I'm still not sure how I feel about it.
**Jdawson**: Oh, really?
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: I wasn't expecting that.
**Speaker 1**: They burned the crap out of my face with that laser they take tattoos off with.
**Speaker 1**: I think.
**Jdawson**: Why they do that again?
**Speaker 1**: To break up all the crap inside of my face that's plugging those glands in my eyes.
**Jdawson**: Really?
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So they got to go like huge raccoon circles around my eyes right up to the crack in my eyelids with that laser.
**Jdawson**: Damn.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: You look like a raccoon.
**Speaker 1**: I haven't looked yet, but I. I do know that I scored some of that sunscreen you see in the 80s movies that makes people's noses ghost white.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: I got two little cups of that that I'm supposed to wear every time I go outside on my whole face.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, that's a little out there.
**Jdawson**: I think you're some sort of influencer.
**Jdawson**: Skin tight.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I felt like a lot of the ladies getting plastic surgery stuff.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Damn.
**Jdawson**: Well, I pulled that off the website.
**Speaker 1**: I don't.
**Jdawson**: I didn't confirm like is it up to date?
**Jdawson**: Is it the latest.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, this impact phase thing.
**Jdawson**: But I think valid July 2, 2024 it says.
**Jdawson**: But they don't.
**Jdawson**: I don't know if they would update that, but we can get close to just have a budget, you know.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: I'll just put this in a spreadsheet.
**Speaker 1**: It looks easy enough.
**Jdawson**: It looks like.
**Jdawson**: And they want 10 grand a pop for high rise.
**Speaker 1**: And it's just the impact fees, right?
**Speaker 1**: Or is it?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, so the admin fee doesn't apply.
**Jdawson**: Well, not wood.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, so it's the right.
**Speaker 1**: The far right total column.
**Speaker 1**: That's for each unit?
**Speaker 1**: For each one of these?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, the square foot stuff might ballpark, but I can scale.
**Jdawson**: Hotel, motel or timeshare.
**Jdawson**: It's a lot cheaper, but I guess they make up their.
**Jdawson**: They make their money on the.
**Jdawson**: The hotel fees.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Oh, here we go.
**Speaker 1**: You're not sharing if you thought you were.
**Jdawson**: Oh, no, I'm not.
**Jdawson**: Is that.
**Jdawson**: I'm just looking at that form we have.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: That's big to call into the production architect.
**Jdawson**: Message in Alvaro.
**Jdawson**: He's the design.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I don't.
**Speaker 1**: Does it make sense to talk about these dates now on this jaw schedule?
**Speaker 1**: Brandon sent it to him this morning.
**Jdawson**: Well, did he talk to.
**Jdawson**: I called him last night on the Way home.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Sorry.
**Jdawson**: Send a message there.
**Jdawson**: Sending a message.
**Jdawson**: But so I just told like four years, that's like, that's a lot ask.
**Jdawson**: He said, well, make it five years in.
**Jdawson**: Well, we just got to be refinanced by 7.
**Jdawson**: But you know, talking, you know, in the meeting today with Mike, he's like, yeah, we're not going to wait till the very end to refinance that.
**Jdawson**: You know, we'll get buildings done and we'll refinance, you know, as we compete the different phases.
**Jdawson**: So, you know, we'll stretch it out to five years, you know, at least for now.
**Speaker 1**: That's much more doable than four.
**Jdawson**: Right, right.
**Jdawson**: Even if, like if you wanted to get your together and you spent the first year planning everything, getting all your infrastructure in, all utilities, everything bought out.
**Jdawson**: You know, it drives me crazy when you build something and the people either don't give you enough time or you got people that don't coordinate everything, figure out issues before they start.
**Speaker 1**: Oh yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Just rushing into it, seeing the finish line, but not what it takes to get there.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, they think they're saving time, but they're.
**Jdawson**: Especially with post tension, you don't.
**Jdawson**: You got one shot at that when you pour that slab.
**Jdawson**: That's it.
**Jdawson**: And you know, they don't want to coordinate, make sure everything's in the right spot.
**Jdawson**: And so I would use that at least six months of our first year just to make sure when we get started, like everything's in place and been coordinated, you know.
**Speaker 1**: Oh yeah.
**Speaker 1**: There's going to be some heavy war room hours at the front end of this thing.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jdawson**: And you think.
**Speaker 1**: Just logistics.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, exactly.
**Speaker 1**: It's also a lot of job trailers.
**Jdawson**: Heck yeah.
**Jdawson**: Like, you know, we'll have 600 to a thousand people workers there every day.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Where are we going to park those people?
**Jdawson**: So he did agree, like the golf course is going to have to be the last thing we do.
**Jdawson**: And we use that as a gigantic lay down staging and yeah.
**Jdawson**: Parking and all that other.
**Speaker 1**: So it's pretty easy to dig down there and put back.
**Speaker 1**: Because it's all sand, you said.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, for the most part it's all sand.
**Jdawson**: That's the other thing.
**Jdawson**: Like sand, you know, if you just have water trucks on it, you don't even have to put a stone lot in.
**Speaker 1**: Oh no, I've done what you're talking about.
**Speaker 1**: It's beautiful.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: You just keep it wet.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Drive right on it.
**Speaker 1**: So yeah, I did it in South Carolina.
**Speaker 1**: It was awesome.
**Speaker 1**: When it poured rain, it didn't matter.
**Speaker 1**: Just let it diffuse into the ground and keep working.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, well, you know, and the.
**Jdawson**: I call it sugar sand, but if you got that like it.
**Jdawson**: Your worst thing you can do is let it dry out because.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, in Orlando I did a project and I would have to literally go out and water that, hose it all down or the, you know, the lifts would get stuck in it.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, they just bury themselves.
**Jdawson**: Oh, but anywho.
**Jdawson**: So let's look at this.
**Jdawson**: I don't know if you got a plan you want to look at.
**Jdawson**: We'll just brainstorm about like the overall site plan.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I got it right here.
**Jdawson**: But I got a call into.
**Jdawson**: So Danny is.
**Jdawson**: He's with odt, they're architectural firm here in Florida.
**Jdawson**: They do big condos, develop things like that.
**Jdawson**: And then Alvaro is a guy.
**Jdawson**: He's a.
**Jdawson**: They're an architectural firm.
**Jdawson**: They got offices in Miami, I think Austin, Mexico, like all over the place.
**Jdawson**: And they do these.
**Jdawson**: Like their design for this resort will be so kick ass, you'll think you're in Cancun or some, you know, Bahama destination, you know.
**Speaker 1**: Is he the one that supplied the renderings of the other.
**Speaker 1**: The other projects or the examples?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, the ones we attached.
**Jdawson**: Well, some of those were combo of Phil and like I think we saved.
**Jdawson**: If you go into the.
**Jdawson**: That I think the proposal folder.
**Jdawson**: Let me see.
**Jdawson**: They sent us a their proposal and.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, is that the full brochure thing?
**Jdawson**: It's gdi.
**Jdawson**: Well, no, that.
**Jdawson**: Let's see here.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, if you go to bid response, I can share it.
**Speaker 1**: I'm in there.
**Jdawson**: So this is the one.
**Speaker 1**: Holy.
**Jdawson**: Like, this is different projects they've done.
**Jdawson**: Alvaro is the guy I got to know doing that last condo I built.
**Jdawson**: And yeah, like this cool stuff.
**Jdawson**: These guys.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, this stuff's really cool.
**Speaker 1**: Holy.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: These guys are gonna be fun to work with, are they not the ego guys or they're.
**Jdawson**: No, Alvaro's cool as like all of their guys.
**Jdawson**: So some more stuff.
**Jdawson**: This.
**Jdawson**: Oh.
**Speaker 1**: Is he gonna do Port Collective too?
**Speaker 1**: That looks a lot like their feel.
**Jdawson**: That's Justin.
**Jdawson**: Oh, that's Kimich.
**Jdawson**: And then they got some design.
**Jdawson**: Architect.
**Speaker 1**: Holy.
**Jdawson**: See, I think that's a hell of a building there, huh?
**Jdawson**: Like this is Serena.
**Jdawson**: That's that condo.
**Jdawson**: Last job I did before I came with to Alito.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And clear water.
**Speaker 1**: That's a nice place.
**Jdawson**: It is.
**Jdawson**: That is.
**Jdawson**: Do you like this look?
**Jdawson**: I love that.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Something like that is cool as hell.
**Jdawson**: Those are cool.
**Jdawson**: Like you think about, you know, those 48 condos that are right there on the island.
**Jdawson**: Yep, something like that.
**Speaker 1**: That's the bay facing side of it.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Literally like there's nothing selling like there's just nothing like it in.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, that would be a super hot place to get a timeshare.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: This is the view from that.
**Jdawson**: That condo because you're looking over, this is the intercoastal and this is Clearwater beach out here.
**Jdawson**: It's pretty sweet.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, that's really cool.
**Speaker 1**: I love the brutalist architecture.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Have you ever seen one of those black concrete houses?
**Speaker 1**: You should look those up sometime.
**Speaker 1**: Those are incredible.
**Jdawson**: Black concrete.
**Jdawson**: They just dye the concrete when they pour it.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: It's like the most least carbon footprint.
**Speaker 1**: Fireproof, earthquake proof, maintenance free.
**Speaker 1**: It's just a concrete shell with windows and the they do with them they must just put echo forms up like this crazy jigsaw puzzle and pour the out of it because they're enormous and they're awesome looking.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, let's check that out.
**Jdawson**: Trying to find boss Creal.
**Jdawson**: So this is where I went when I worked for Valor.
**Jdawson**: That's a company that did Serena, where's this place?
**Speaker 1**: That's awesome.
**Jdawson**: This is in Bosrial is a city they created right.
**Jdawson**: Right in Mexico city.
**Speaker 1**: Oh nice.
**Jdawson**: 30 years ago.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, that's up in the corner there.
**Jdawson**: Well like this is just one of the buildings but it's like it's a whole city.
**Jdawson**: It's incredible.
**Jdawson**: It's got the largest athletic like or like a.
**Jdawson**: What do you call it?
**Jdawson**: Like you know, I'd have a sports club or you know with the gym and the all the different courts and stuff.
**Jdawson**: It's like 500,000 square feet.
**Jdawson**: It's just insane.
**Jdawson**: It's gigantic.
**Jdawson**: And they got things like that but you know it's Mexico so they can build it cheap as hell.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: That building in the back looks like that one in London.
**Jdawson**: Oh, this one here?
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, that big circle looking thing in London.
**Speaker 1**: I don't even remember what it's called.
**Speaker 1**: I've been to it and I just learned this morning that Finland built a Ferris wheel like the London Eye.
**Speaker 1**: But it's all saunas.
**Jdawson**: So you just sit in there and.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, like that.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, you just go around at a Ferris wheel and bake in a little sauna.
**Speaker 1**: They built it in Helsinki.
**Jdawson**: Damn.
**Jdawson**: So anyways that's dbi so I gonna try to get their full design cost on that.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, their stuff's awesome.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: But yeah, you can go back to the site plan.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Real quick before we dive into that.
**Speaker 1**: Do you want me to book Tampa next week for Monday to Friday?
**Jdawson**: See, maybe if you go to Indy first.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Brandon's going to be up there.
**Jdawson**: They're having a topping out party Friday.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: I'm not gonna be able to get up there because I have my son visiting.
**Jdawson**: So then you come here the week after.
**Jdawson**: That might work.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: You got that guy coming next week too, don't you hear?
**Speaker 1**: That meeting, you say there was somebody coming or something happening that next week in Florida.
**Jdawson**: Now I'm wondering what I meant forgetting.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, you said some thought it'd be good for me to be there because somebody was coming or you were meeting someone or something.
**Speaker 1**: But I can ask Brandon if he wants me to come up there next week, if that.
**Speaker 1**: That works.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I'm trying to think.
**Speaker 1**: I don't remember who.
**Speaker 1**: You said it was somebody that would have been good for me to meet.
**Speaker 1**: That's all I remember about it.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Damn, I'm stumped here.
**Jdawson**: Trying to think this next week.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, you can just let me know sometime this week what to do.
**Speaker 1**: I can travel is nothing for me.
**Speaker 1**: I already got dog boarding arrangements on deck, so.
**Jdawson**: Okay, it's nothing.
**Speaker 1**: And then that bi weekly design meeting for Port Collective is the first meeting Friday the 25th?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, it'll be next Friday.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: And then is it the same attendance list as the initial meeting?
**Jdawson**: I believe so.
**Jdawson**: We gotta figure out on the design portion of it.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so maybe take her off and then just from the meeting minutes they.
**Jdawson**: All the people they listed and talked about, I think were on there or.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, and that.
**Speaker 1**: I think I know what you're talking about.
**Speaker 1**: So she is that one girl that was on there with.
**Speaker 1**: With the.
**Jdawson**: Not with a different name.
**Jdawson**: The one that was talking.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah, she's with the MEP sub.
**Jdawson**: I think she was over everything maybe.
**Jdawson**: Or.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, so I'll take her off and I'll just put everybody else.
**Jdawson**: Oh, no, the only one that wasn't on there is she declined it and didn't join.
**Jdawson**: She was the interior designer.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, okay.
**Speaker 1**: I got you.
**Speaker 1**: I thought you meant take her off the bi weekly.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, no, it's just.
**Jdawson**: I'm saying when you send it out again, don't send it to that design, the interior design lady, because we may not use her too.
**Jdawson**: We don't know yet.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: And then do we want that to just run to the end of the year generically?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Thank you.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Share my screen.
**Jdawson**: Do you have the aerial?
**Jdawson**: You bring up the satellite image from that brochure.
**Jdawson**: See what we're working with currently.
**Jdawson**: There we go.
**Jdawson**: So there's like a little pond, a couple of the ponds.
**Speaker 1**: This is probably going to be the ideal.
**Jdawson**: Notice where they got the future golf course maintenance.
**Jdawson**: Looks like it is the old.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, zoom in on that.
**Jdawson**: Like, what is that?
**Jdawson**: Looks like there's a building there already.
**Speaker 1**: Maybe it's like some kind of water reservoir.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, it's a pond.
**Jdawson**: It's got a little bubbler in the middle.
**Jdawson**: I wonder, like, that looks like an access road that.
**Jdawson**: Where we could cut across right here.
**Jdawson**: Like there maybe.
**Jdawson**: And on the top side of it looks like that right there.
**Jdawson**: Huh.
**Jdawson**: So that we could connect these two areas to use whether that's parking in that other side.
**Jdawson**: But just looking at the.
**Jdawson**: Well, if this area, like, it may be where we need to park people all the way up in here.
**Jdawson**: You know.
**Speaker 1**: Up in this area right.
**Jdawson**: On the other side of the road right here.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: The two bottom dicks.
**Jdawson**: If you go across the X, like Bur Kalia Avenue and get into the other two dicks.
**Jdawson**: That area to the left.
**Speaker 1**: So this.
**Speaker 1**: This area.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: That's how we should name the construction streets.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: North west, lower dick, northwest, middle dick, northwest, upper deck.
**Speaker 1**: Park at the tip.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: All of the concrete guys park on the tip.
**Jdawson**: All of the framers have to park on the shaft.
**Jdawson**: And all the interior guys gets, like, down by the ball sack.
**Speaker 1**: He shoot out the ad.
**Speaker 1**: Because we're going to have to have parking.
**Speaker 1**: And then we're going to have to have a delivery area.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: And then a staging area by each active work area.
**Speaker 1**: And then a trailer area.
**Jdawson**: So think about, like, if.
**Jdawson**: Let me.
**Jdawson**: I'm gonna open this up.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: You want to share yours?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Let me close this somehow.
**Jdawson**: I gotta get another instrument out this week.
**Jdawson**: Nobody to do it, but I can help.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I mean, so it's the.
**Jdawson**: That Clearwater beach one.
**Jdawson**: It's pretty simple.
**Jdawson**: We just put some budget numbers to it.
**Jdawson**: And I've got a bunch of photos I gotta save in the folder just so you can see what's there.
**Jdawson**: See here.
**Jdawson**: Hey, Mike, what's up?
**Jdawson**: Hey.
**Jdawson**: I changed the.
**Jdawson**: For each dumpster can drop off cheap at all.
**Jdawson**: So they charge.
**Jdawson**: Did you check with the city?
**Jdawson**: At Clearwater?
**Jdawson**: They have dumpster service, too, I think.
**Jdawson**: What did you send me your advise your, quote, proposal and send it to me.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And then I. I just got to pull a permit, so I have to go pull a permit.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that'll take a couple days.
**Jdawson**: She said didn't get it in just a couple Days.
**Jdawson**: And you could start as soon as we get the perm.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Get me the written proposal and then I get this approved and then we can move on.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: All right, thanks.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, bye.
**Jdawson**: That guy get everything in writing with the guy.
**Jdawson**: I had a conversation with him.
**Jdawson**: Then he comes back, raises it by a few grand like dude, okay, let me find this paradise aisle.
**Jdawson**: Go owner.
**Jdawson**: Do we.
**Jdawson**: Is that saved in the estimate folder?
**Jdawson**: The one you got open?
**Jdawson**: Full brochure.
**Speaker 1**: That's the 2 23, 21 1.
**Speaker 1**: Let me find the folder.
**Jdawson**: There, I got it.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, it's in the estimate.
**Jdawson**: So blows it up a little more.
**Speaker 1**: So you're not sharing yet.
**Jdawson**: Oh, sorry.
**Jdawson**: Extract this page, save in that same folder.
**Speaker 1**: Overlay the lay downs on it.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So I'm thinking is like this is our main road and this is kind of a secondary road to get in here.
**Jdawson**: So like right now they got.
**Jdawson**: They laid out where the ponds are.
**Jdawson**: The existing ones a little better.
**Jdawson**: Makes it more helpful.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: But like if this road here, our construction traffic comes like the deliveries come in here, come on the backside of our, you know, these first phase jobs.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Right in between them.
**Jdawson**: We can have like our traffic go.
**Jdawson**: You know we could have like even directional.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Because we're going to need a truck turn around or a one way in, one way out kind of thing.
**Jdawson**: That's what I mean.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: We could make them go like this.
**Speaker 1**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: And then you know, we can have material staging areas.
**Jdawson**: I don't think the.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, the townhomes don't go back that far.
**Jdawson**: You'd be like here.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: That's the access road.
**Jdawson**: And then we load up all of this.
**Jdawson**: Like these are the people's.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, that's if that's wide enough.
**Speaker 1**: That would be real convenient because they can just drop in different areas of that and just keep driving.
**Jdawson**: Heck yeah.
**Jdawson**: They can come through here, get to wherever.
**Jdawson**: You know, each of our sub will have their lay down area.
**Speaker 1**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: Like through here so that like they come in, unload, go out.
**Jdawson**: That keeps like all the deliveries like running smooth.
**Jdawson**: And then over here we got, you know, you think about it, this is probably thousand car parking lot but you get this.
**Speaker 1**: And the office is next to that delivery area would probably be ideal because they're going to send the engineer out to get the delivery.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: This is like employee parking or island.
**Jdawson**: See here.
**Jdawson**: Need to switch to the pouches.
**Speaker 1**: I have them in the drawer.
**Jdawson**: Do you.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jdawson**: Do you have get these things?
**Speaker 1**: No, I.
**Speaker 1**: Those.
**Speaker 1**: I've tried them.
**Speaker 1**: They're too lightweight.
**Speaker 1**: No, Offense.
**Jdawson**: Really?
**Jdawson**: Well, I just stick like four of them in there.
**Speaker 1**: That's what I see.
**Speaker 1**: Most people do it.
**Speaker 1**: I tried it and like my whole bottom come full.
**Speaker 1**: But I quit when I was 40.
**Jdawson**: Really?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: That's just kind of temporary.
**Jdawson**: This is up here.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So then like this, like maybe employee parking here and then here you can have job trailers.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Because that's not going to get into.
**Speaker 1**: That would get into.
**Speaker 1**: Let me see.
**Jdawson**: Job trailers here.
**Jdawson**: And then here we got parking.
**Jdawson**: You're.
**Jdawson**: And I know this.
**Jdawson**: Oh, yeah, that's right.
**Jdawson**: We're building this.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: The job trailers in that green area are in Area 5 and part of 3.
**Jdawson**: So maybe we shorten this up.
**Jdawson**: Oh, we got to get like.
**Jdawson**: How are we going to get behind here?
**Speaker 1**: Well, why don't we Area 6 over there in the bottom right corner.
**Speaker 1**: Can't we make that parking if we're building that 300 unit last?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: GMS.
**Jdawson**: Dylan, Claudia.
**Jdawson**: Dylan, Claudia's on who this is.
**Jdawson**: Hello.
**Jdawson**: What can I do for you?
**Jdawson**: Care is probably one of bigger areas to get discounts that I.
**Jdawson**: That nature reaching out to you because I want to be in your area, like Friday with ems.
**Jdawson**: Not where you meet.
**Jdawson**: Man, I'm so busy.
**Jdawson**: I wish I could.
**Jdawson**: Wish I could take the time out, but honestly I just can't at this point.
**Jdawson**: Is there like a better time of the year for you where.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, there's never a good time.
**Jdawson**: But you could.
**Jdawson**: You can call me in a month or so and see how things are going at that point.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: See it.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So there's our.
**Jdawson**: There's our thing we need to construct.
**Speaker 1**: We can just shift the orientation of that job trailer area north to south and take up that.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: There in front of the purple.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And get off of that thing.
**Jdawson**: And so this up here.
**Jdawson**: And we're probably.
**Jdawson**: This is a lot of area.
**Jdawson**: And two, we're going to buy some of these houses.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So we know which ones.
**Jdawson**: Not really sure.
**Jdawson**: We got job trailers here, parking here.
**Jdawson**: This all fits.
**Jdawson**: There's plenty of room behind these townhomes to get an access road in.
**Speaker 1**: Rent all those houses to crew.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: What I was saying told Brandon we should just, you know, buy a couple of them.
**Jdawson**: Put all them rowdy construction workers in it.
**Jdawson**: Drive all the rest of the neighbors out of there.
**Speaker 1**: That's perfect.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Give them a free case of liquor every Friday.
**Jdawson**: No kidding.
**Jdawson**: Fireworks.
**Jdawson**: Give them a box of fireworks and liquor.
**Speaker 1**: Brings back so many memories.
**Jdawson**: I know.
**Jdawson**: So, yeah.
**Jdawson**: So this wouldn't be nearly this long.
**Jdawson**: So we shorten this up and then how do we get out?
**Jdawson**: So then we would have to rotate through here.
**Speaker 1**: Can't you just build that road out that goes right by 10a?
**Speaker 1**: See it up behind between 10a and 10b.
**Jdawson**: They can't forget these sports courts, right?
**Speaker 1**: Oh, yeah.
**Jdawson**: Come through here.
**Jdawson**: And there's this street comes out here.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, out here.
**Jdawson**: We go in here.
**Jdawson**: Q.
**Speaker 1**: If that 10A is just going to be a pad, we can straighten that road out quite a bit too.
**Speaker 1**: Right there.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Like, you know, this is one of the.
**Jdawson**: I think this was further on in the project when we were building these anyways.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, it's phase five.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Because we can build our way out of that too.
**Speaker 1**: And just have a.
**Speaker 1**: Like an evolution of this plan for.
**Jdawson**: Look at all these empty lots through here too.
**Jdawson**: You know, we can.
**Speaker 1**: Are we allowed to touch those though, with anything?
**Jdawson**: That's why.
**Jdawson**: I don't know, maybe for everything around here, people are going to buy up once this thing starts getting built.
**Jdawson**: But like just general idea this.
**Jdawson**: When you look at the size of these things, like each person has a lot of size lay down.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, that's a big two, three lots.
**Jdawson**: That's a lot of area.
**Jdawson**: But then again, we're going to have a lot of subs in here.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: The big deliveries are probably going to be metal and drywall.
**Jdawson**: Like if they each had three lots, you know.
**Jdawson**: No, that's the double.
**Jdawson**: That's one lot.
**Jdawson**: Yes, that's about right.
**Jdawson**: We have a house lot then through there.
**Jdawson**: So here's our deliveries shooting through here, dropping off all their parking here.
**Jdawson**: And then we got the overflow parking if needed.
**Speaker 1**: Will Scott village here.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, that's a good thing to use that for.
**Jdawson**: Come across that little road, come up here.
**Jdawson**: Boom.
**Jdawson**: That there.
**Jdawson**: And then we got all this we can use for parking.
**Speaker 1**: All kinds of cars for those people to break into.
**Jdawson**: That's right.
**Jdawson**: I'm thinking like, you know, we're gonna front finance this thing.
**Jdawson**: We could purchase.
**Jdawson**: We could pre purchase like so much and get all the materials on site.
**Jdawson**: Just have freaking gigantic.
**Speaker 1**: That's what I was saying about a satellite lay down.
**Speaker 1**: Just get all the shit there and then you can just pick from your own inventory.
**Jdawson**: Exactly.
**Jdawson**: Never want for anything.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, never wait for a thing.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And then if you think about, you know, our.
**Jdawson**: If you're going to set up a back plant, would you set it up over here, like in a spot like this?
**Jdawson**: And then put a road in for like over here for the deliveries of just a temp access road over here for.
**Speaker 1**: Concrete you get kind of lucky because you can put it kind of wherever you want in your work area.
**Speaker 1**: Because if you think about how long those trucks are driving from the actual batch plant to your job site with mud.
**Jdawson**: Well that's like these future condos.
**Jdawson**: That would be a perfect spot.
**Speaker 1**: Well, anywhere as long as you can get Conex deliveries of super sacks of cement powder and then you have aggregate deliveries.
**Speaker 1**: And then I think for water we can just get the, you know the trailers that have the stilts that just automatically shoot up the water tanker.
**Speaker 1**: Have you seen those?
**Jdawson**: No.
**Speaker 1**: Oh yeah, those are sweet.
**Speaker 1**: So we could.
**Speaker 1**: Should be able to self contain that thing as long as we can get power to it somehow.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Because then we got here is another whole lay down area where these condos are going to.
**Jdawson**: Hmm.
**Jdawson**: This like phase one.
**Jdawson**: We would do this as phase one.
**Speaker 1**: Environmental might really like us if we establish one concrete cleanout by this area too.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And this is like phase one lay down area in there.
**Jdawson**: And then to get this road in.
**Speaker 1**: I was curing down there.
**Jdawson**: I'm sorry, has.
**Speaker 1**: What is concrete curing pretty slow down there?
**Jdawson**: No.
**Jdawson**: No.
**Speaker 1**: Accelerators or anything to speed up that process.
**Jdawson**: Not on.
**Jdawson**: Well the post tension they poured so hot.
**Jdawson**: Doesn't matter anyways because they're doing a 5,000 mix or more just because of their.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, you know they, the columns are setting on them like the next day.
**Jdawson**: So like everything is just hot mud.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And then the slabs, you know, they use the same mix for the slabs.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Speaker 1**: Forms are going to be the, the thing that holds them up.
**Jdawson**: Well, that's too.
**Jdawson**: They got, you know, they get all these forms pre built.
**Jdawson**: They just, they just get enough so they got two sets of everything and then they pour, take them off and they pour the other and take them off and jump to another floor.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So this we have lay down trailers, lay down parking.
**Jdawson**: Parking and I mean there's potential.
**Jdawson**: Looks like these aren't connected.
**Jdawson**: So this also.
**Speaker 1**: Are those even.
**Speaker 1**: Are those existing.
**Jdawson**: The ponds, those two?
**Speaker 1**: Because it looks like those are proposed in the tidal lagoon.
**Speaker 1**: The one on the bottom right is the only one that's actually there.
**Jdawson**: I think they just drew them out on the map so you could see them better.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, okay.
**Speaker 1**: I just looked at the aerial and they.
**Speaker 1**: All three of them are there.
**Speaker 1**: They're just smaller.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, those inlaid lines in them.
**Speaker 1**: But yeah, there's plenty of room over there in between them.
**Speaker 1**: If you make designated parking spots for AHJs right up in the front.
**Speaker 1**: They love it.
**Jdawson**: Exactly.
**Jdawson**: Hell yeah.
**Jdawson**: We got that Got our trucks, deliveries coming through and then it works awesome down here.
**Jdawson**: Have you ever done a washout for the delivery trucks and built it out of like asphalt and it's Danny.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, Danny.
**Jdawson**: What's he been up to, man?
**Jdawson**: It's been a while.
**Jdawson**: Good, good.
**Jdawson**: Super busy.
**Jdawson**: Weird.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Every time I. I'm hooked on Guinness now, so every time I drink one, I'm like, God damn, Danny, we need to go have there where?
**Jdawson**: Like I said, health issues take care of some.
**Jdawson**: But yeah.
**Jdawson**: Better get back to it.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Wow.
**Jdawson**: You need to like.
**Jdawson**: Nothing serious or could have been just getting through.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I'm glad.
**Jdawson**: Had a rough weekend.
**Jdawson**: Doing better now.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Oh, man, we got to get together.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, no, no problem.
**Jdawson**: I mean.
**Jdawson**: And this paradise aisle, did he talk to you about that?
**Jdawson**: I don't know how much he talked to you about it.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So this thing is in a matter of weeks.
**Jdawson**: Like we're all confident we're going to get.
**Jdawson**: Get it and it's a go.
**Jdawson**: And if we get it, like we really need to build the whole thing out in five.
**Jdawson**: Five years, which is.
**Jdawson**: Is very.
**Jdawson**: It's a lot.
**Jdawson**: But we're trying to just make sure we're good on our design costs.
**Jdawson**: Now I do want to use Alvaro.
**Jdawson**: He said he loved working with you.
**Jdawson**: He would love it to have him do just like the concept designs and the exteriors, all that and then you guys do all the production drawings for the whole thing.
**Jdawson**: So could you.
**Jdawson**: What do you need for me to just give me a safe number to throw in.
**Jdawson**: No pressure, but I need to get something today.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And it can't.
**Jdawson**: It's a swag.
**Jdawson**: It's like we can give you like here's this.
**Jdawson**: Because we're going to change everything anyways.
**Jdawson**: You know, we can't change the island because it's approved the way it is and we need to get the permit for the end of the year.
**Jdawson**: But like the actual buildings, it's just a rough, you know.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so there's.
**Jdawson**: It's 270 acre site.
**Jdawson**: It's got a 18 hole golf course on it.
**Jdawson**: It's got a hundred or no, two.
**Jdawson**: Let me look.
**Jdawson**: See, I got.
**Jdawson**: We hired another Jesse, Jesse R. He's a senior pm.
**Jdawson**: He's been helping on it.
**Jdawson**: So they.
**Jdawson**: Hey Jesse, can you read off the numbers, like total units, like how many condos?
**Jdawson**: Units, how many townhomes?
**Jdawson**: I think we got like 200.
**Jdawson**: And.
**Speaker 1**: Let me find them.
**Jdawson**: 290 townhomes there.
**Jdawson**: 162 here.
**Jdawson**: That's 400 and some townhomes.
**Jdawson**: 1, 2, 800.
**Jdawson**: Like 1200 condos.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: And a 310 unit hotel with retail a go.
**Jdawson**: Like the clubhouse for the Gore stop.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Clubhouse.
**Jdawson**: There's retail.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Below everything, like.
**Jdawson**: Oh, yeah, yeah.
**Jdawson**: Like.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: Did you think of, like, each of these condos, like, that's on the island?
**Jdawson**: The bottom floor is retail restaurants.
**Jdawson**: You know, they all have rooftop restaurant features.
**Jdawson**: You know, because there's a total of.
**Jdawson**: See, there's 1, 2, 3, 4.
**Jdawson**: So 5.
**Jdawson**: Five of the buildings on the island will have rooftop amenities.
**Jdawson**: And there's a total of two.
**Jdawson**: The bigger, larger units.
**Jdawson**: 1, 2, 3, 9.
**Jdawson**: Nine buildings that are the condo nature or there's one big parking structure.
**Jdawson**: I'm going to email you this.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: Basically just have everything from like this design development all the way to the end.
**Jdawson**: Or would it be like schematic design?
**Jdawson**: I don't know exactly how that works, but, you know, if you think of like in my mind, Alvaro, his guys, they.
**Jdawson**: They lay out kind of the outsides of the buildings and what the facade looks like and, you know, the interiors and the entries and, like, how that stuff works out.
**Jdawson**: And then you guys make sure you guys draw it so we can build it.
**Jdawson**: Like all those drawings.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: I'll send you this.
**Jdawson**: This was their.
**Jdawson**: You know, he.
**Jdawson**: The guy that owns the property currently had this.
**Jdawson**: Them do this, like, brochure.
**Jdawson**: So it's got like kind of a list of all the things about the property.
**Jdawson**: So I'll get you that.
**Jdawson**: That may be enough for you to take a look at it.
**Jdawson**: And he did a.
**Jdawson**: He just.
**Jdawson**: Initially when we were gonna, you know, we thought we were going to do a presentation this landowner and do a whole design of.
**Jdawson**: Design concept of it.
**Jdawson**: He sent something.
**Jdawson**: But I still need.
**Jdawson**: I got to get from him his design numbers and Alvaro's looked at.
**Jdawson**: You can call him too.
**Jdawson**: I mean, he likes you, Danny.
**Jdawson**: So give him a call and.
**Jdawson**: Because I told him that's the way I wanted to do it, and he's like, man, that's great.
**Jdawson**: I love Danny.
**Jdawson**: So, yeah, so awesome.
**Jdawson**: Good deal.
**Jdawson**: Appreciate it.
**Jdawson**: And beers.
**Jdawson**: Beers soon.
**Jdawson**: All right, cool.
**Jdawson**: See you.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Let me email this to Danny.
**Jdawson**: He's cool.
**Jdawson**: He's an architect that I worked with a little bit.
**Jdawson**: How's it over the last company and he just bought a house.
**Jdawson**: Like, I don't know.
**Jdawson**: It's probably been six, eight months ago.
**Jdawson**: I helped him.
**Jdawson**: I lined him up with all the subs to kind of remodel it.
**Jdawson**: What he Wanted to do and sweet.
**Jdawson**: I do about everything myself.
**Jdawson**: Anyway, so the plumber that I tried to line him up with turned to and so I ended up doing all the plumbing for his remodel.
**Jdawson**: I was over there every weekend knocking that out.
**Speaker 1**: Do you have the same tool problem I have?
**Jdawson**: What's that?
**Speaker 1**: It takes a 26 foot u haul to move my tools around.
**Jdawson**: Oh yeah.
**Jdawson**: I don't.
**Jdawson**: Everything I got fits in my truck.
**Jdawson**: I don't have the industrial remodeling stuff.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: My tools are the hardest thing for me to move.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: That's awesome.
**Jdawson**: I just love being able to build shit and.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Make stuff.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: I love doing that stuff.
**Speaker 1**: I think this gives plenty of space for everything.
**Jdawson**: Hell yeah.
**Speaker 1**: I'm assuming all these guys have like side by sides they run around site with.
**Jdawson**: We're going to need a troop for ourselves.
**Jdawson**: But what I'm thinking is like we get.
**Jdawson**: And we'll build this bridge right away.
**Jdawson**: See it knock this island, get these three bridges in.
**Jdawson**: So then we got construction traffic with little side by sides and get in over here.
**Jdawson**: This is all just like the employees would come through here and all the construction, like the actual materials going into the job site would go through here.
**Jdawson**: And then obviously we got all our material coming through here.
**Speaker 1**: So.
**Jdawson**: Go ahead.
**Jdawson**: How you go ahead.
**Jdawson**: I was just saying like we could set up that concrete plant like there.
**Jdawson**: Uh huh.
**Jdawson**: And just have this.
**Jdawson**: Because we're gonna have to come through this job trail area somehow.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: The other part about concrete on site is you want to give it enough time to mix so your trucks aren't sitting in line at the pour.
**Speaker 1**: So giving them a little drive time helps out.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: But if there's enough room by the plant, they can just sit there with this.
**Speaker 1**: With the way this is getting laid out to it, would it make sense to just start building on the north end of that island and work our way to the southeast corner?
**Jdawson**: Come down this way.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So that they can have that space actually occupied and functioning while we're building the ass end of it.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Because if they'd allow us.
**Jdawson**: Fire department may.
**Jdawson**: I don't know if they'll care if we got two routes in.
**Jdawson**: But yeah.
**Jdawson**: Get this stuff done.
**Jdawson**: Get the hotel down to here, all the marina done.
**Jdawson**: Because then you could have almost a software opening for the hotel and these units.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Finish this.
**Jdawson**: Like all these would be open.
**Speaker 1**: Because the island's their priority too.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Speaker 1**: Like as far as sequence, they want the island running.
**Jdawson**: Well it wasn't at first, but we don't have the time and now like if we're going to build this all at once.
**Jdawson**: That's all I'm saying.
**Jdawson**: Like once we're done with this hotel, it needs to be open.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: You know, condo units, you know, that's a little easier because you can just tell them it's, you know, there's other construction going on.
**Jdawson**: Who gives a.
**Jdawson**: But people coming to stay in a hotel aren't going to want to have.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, well this noise going on, we almost like all this needs to be done.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: And the boat, that boat thing will take three months to build.
**Jdawson**: So like it could be, we could be wrapped up on the island and then this like coordinate that with the grand opening of this hotel.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: That would probably make the owner happy.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Then, then we just do this, wrap this up last and then work out through the golf course.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Because if we can do them a solid and give them a soft opening early on that we're probably going to end up needing forgiveness on the overall schedule at some point.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I'm thinking too like once we finish the island up and we're just down to this, you know our workforce is going to be cut in like to nothing.
**Jdawson**: So then we just like if you, we start looking at the scheduling phases then all this shit goes away and we finish this side of the golf course and we just follow ourselves the fuck out of here for this last section.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: That's why that basically those two 300 unit condos, the phase six part and then 4.8 the site improvements are kind of the only things going on in 29 on that schedule.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Which now will make it at the end of 30.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So it'll kind of like you said, just trickle everybody out of the areas that can be occupied and operating.
**Jdawson**: You know we could eat like when we do these, we're gonna have the condos over here.
**Jdawson**: Thinking about, you know, do you think about, you know when the people are coming in and out.
**Jdawson**: We could knock these townhomes out first.
**Speaker 1**: And we'll also have all those units done theoretically in phase one and two.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: All this will be done.
**Speaker 1**: 288 units.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, it's all done this all done and just be finishing this mess out here and like their maintenance like this is the golf course maintenance supposedly.
**Jdawson**: Huh.
**Jdawson**: Like we could almost consolidate the construction area down to this.
**Speaker 1**: Uh huh.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: The dirt guys can work their way out and to that job trailer area and the parking and start on the golf course when they move out of there.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Let's.
**Jdawson**: What I'm thinking make this right here.
**Jdawson**: Like this would be a great area.
**Jdawson**: Mm.
**Speaker 1**: The only thing we gotta remember is that other golf course maintenance building has to be built up with the.
**Speaker 1**: Right out in the middle like that.
**Jdawson**: That's what I'm saying.
**Jdawson**: Like if the golf course is the last thing we do, who cares about this golf course maintenance?
**Jdawson**: And we just make this like, even in the phase one, we'll have like the.
**Jdawson**: The offices and the people that are going to be there till the very end.
**Jdawson**: We'll put here.
**Speaker 1**: Is that golf maintenance or is that townhome maintenance?
**Jdawson**: It said golf maintenance.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: I was almost thinking to be, you know, each building, of course they didn't have room for maintenance, but makes more sense if they're talking golf.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Because golf maintenance is the one in the middle of the course.
**Speaker 1**: That's what they have that label as.
**Jdawson**: Well in the description.
**Jdawson**: That's what they call this building 12 too.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Because they lumped them together.
**Speaker 1**: That building 18 doesn't exist in the description.
**Speaker 1**: It's like 12B or something.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: But then we just make these like our job trailer and stuff's over here.
**Jdawson**: It's going to be there from day one till the very end.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So we don't.
**Jdawson**: And then like when this stuff all gets cleared out, it'll be over here will just be the subs for these last buildings.
**Speaker 1**: And then would it make sense to put the subs that are going to be there the longest over by us?
**Jdawson**: Exactly.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Make these all the migratory.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: The in and out guys.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, the old in and out.
**Jdawson**: Maximize our real estate here.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: With that course, if it's not totally overgrown, it should be easy to just go out there and mark.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Then like on the island, like the on island lay down area and have that as here.
**Speaker 1**: Who's responsible for surveying on this.
**Jdawson**: Now?
**Jdawson**: We'll get a surveyor.
**Speaker 1**: He's going to be expensive for this.
**Jdawson**: Oh, I bet.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Is it easy to find guys that can do something like this down there?
**Jdawson**: Oh, yeah, they would love it.
**Jdawson**: It's like.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, they just have a guy out there every day for five years.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: Or we may just hire our own surveyor.
**Speaker 1**: Gonna say that would make sense for something like this.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: What do you think of that?
**Jdawson**: We make this the on island.
**Jdawson**: This will be the store staging storage for anything on the island.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, that's plenty.
**Jdawson**: This would be like phase one, but storage.
**Speaker 1**: What are those bridges going to be rated for for us to haul over them?
**Jdawson**: Well, it had to be.
**Jdawson**: Of course.
**Jdawson**: We got tower Crane set up here.
**Jdawson**: They could bring the trucks, like, right here and just crane it right in.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: As long as we got some alternate routes around here.
**Speaker 1**: Just get the core to come.
**Speaker 1**: Drop one of those bridges right there on that end.
**Jdawson**: What's that?
**Speaker 1**: One of those army corps bridges.
**Jdawson**: Oh, yeah, the tank over it.
**Jdawson**: I'm sure it's like a fire truck weighs like 60,000 pounds, so it would have to be rated for that.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Because our.
**Speaker 1**: Our steel loads are going to be really heavy.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: But those can just be picked like you said.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: We need to look at tower crane layouts on any of this.
**Speaker 1**: Or is it going to be pretty easy to put them wherever?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I think we got plenty of room.
**Jdawson**: Put them in.
**Jdawson**: In between.
**Jdawson**: Or if they're setting them in the center, which sucks because you close in after But.
**Speaker 1**: One second, please.
**Speaker 1**: Sorry.
**Speaker 1**: Doctor's office.
**Jdawson**: They're like, have you been putting the gel on your face?
**Jdawson**: God damn it.
**Jdawson**: Jesse.
**Speaker 1**: The other doctor.
**Speaker 1**: I got the follow up for the second doctor visit tomorrow.
**Jdawson**: Or this could.
**Jdawson**: You know, workers trucks are going to need a lot of parking for that.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: For the people with actual tools.
**Jdawson**: This is just like all the car parking.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Because like you said, they're going to need trucks to be hauling in and out, going to their tool trailers and all that.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Unless they got one of them little Kubota dump truck things.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, those are nice because you can only get them to go about 20 miles an hour.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Speaker 1**: And it rides like a buckboard.
**Jdawson**: Be cool if we could just set a tower crane at each of these roundabouts.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, but it's not going to reach.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I think that's it.
**Jdawson**: So if you want to make this thing look pretty, if you scale it, if you think of these houses, that house is like a triple wide or a little less 60 by.
**Jdawson**: What is the triple?
**Jdawson**: I like 40 by 60, I think.
**Speaker 1**: So are those all?
**Speaker 1**: Oh, you're talking for the job trailers.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, like for us, we'll have at least one of those.
**Jdawson**: We're gonna have to have our own QA QC department, which I hate because they're normally.
**Jdawson**: But yeah, we'll be in charge of them, Jesse, So we can.
**Jdawson**: We can manage that.
**Jdawson**: All right, well, I saved this in that folder.
**Speaker 1**: In the documents folder.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So in the estimate again, that.
**Jdawson**: That folder where we've been putting all the stuff that we're specifically using.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, I can see it in there.
**Jdawson**: So then our schedule wise, we got this going on at first, and we start day one building this island.
**Jdawson**: That's why I just.
**Jdawson**: I got.
**Jdawson**: And that's.
**Jdawson**: That's what I meant to tell you.
**Jdawson**: So this guy named Wayne Booth, he was the general superintendent on that Missouri hospital.
**Jdawson**: And he retired, but he would be willing to come back to run something like this.
**Jdawson**: The guys.
**Speaker 1**: Those kind of guys.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, he's a pusher.
**Jdawson**: He loves concrete construction.
**Jdawson**: All kinds of experience building big buildings and big projects.
**Jdawson**: And he just.
**Jdawson**: He's like a pit bull.
**Jdawson**: He just never stops and.
**Jdawson**: But he lives in Phoenix.
**Jdawson**: I feel bad because, like, we've been friends for every year.
**Jdawson**: He calls me his son and.
**Jdawson**: But I didn't have time to go see him, so I didn't mention it.
**Jdawson**: So I want you to.
**Jdawson**: I want to introduce him to you, and you guys should go out and shoot the.
**Jdawson**: And I'm just saying tell them.
**Jdawson**: Don't tell him I came there and I never went to see him.
**Jdawson**: He'd be pissed.
**Speaker 1**: I think they call that black bail.
**Jdawson**: Is it okay?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: When you want something, you just tell me.
**Jdawson**: But.
**Jdawson**: So, yeah, I'd like to.
**Jdawson**: Because he could look at this and he would give a.
**Jdawson**: You know, getting his thoughts on what starts where.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: What kind of.
**Jdawson**: Where the tower cranes would go.
**Jdawson**: You know, all of that.
**Jdawson**: It'd be a big help.
**Jdawson**: So I've been trying to.
**Jdawson**: He just had a knee replacement, so he's kind of a little bit out of commission right now, but.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, but he's super cool guy.
**Jdawson**: He's a Vietnam vet and awesome.
**Jdawson**: In the sub meetings, he always tell subs that were crying.
**Jdawson**: He like mia hamdida.
**Jdawson**: He's like.
**Jdawson**: Know what that means in Vietnamese?
**Jdawson**: Who gives a. Yeah, that.
**Speaker 1**: Whenever.
**Speaker 1**: That's fine.
**Jdawson**: Okay, I'll hook that up.
**Jdawson**: And then.
**Jdawson**: Because thinking it just in my mind, we'd come in here, get the island built.
**Jdawson**: You know, the marina can be going in.
**Jdawson**: Like, they'll have to put all these seawalls in.
**Jdawson**: And that's why.
**Jdawson**: I don't know, you know, thinking about.
**Jdawson**: It'd be much easier if we got a bunch of deep foundations to.
**Jdawson**: You know, they'll let us build the island and leave this all land.
**Jdawson**: Not cut this out yet.
**Jdawson**: So all our traffic goes across here.
**Jdawson**: Get all our deep foundations in.
**Speaker 1**: And.
**Jdawson**: Then finish this up.
**Speaker 1**: That would make the most sense.
**Speaker 1**: Even leave that little backside in the green area so we can.
**Speaker 1**: If we need.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah, it's a good point.
**Jdawson**: And even if, like, they want us to connect this to filter the water, we could drop some timing RCP in there or something.
**Jdawson**: And so it's.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, it's flow Water flow.
**Jdawson**: It's just.
**Jdawson**: We can drive over top of it.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: You could probably just drop a bunch of fish passables in there and bury them for the time being.
**Jdawson**: What's a fish passable?
**Speaker 1**: It's like a.
**Speaker 1**: It's culvert but the bottom's cut out.
**Speaker 1**: So it's just like a big arch.
**Jdawson**: Ah, I got you.
**Speaker 1**: They don't like fish passing over corrugated metal.
**Speaker 1**: Apparently the.
**Speaker 1**: The EPA or the deq I don't remember which one.
**Jdawson**: That makes sense.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Because you could.
**Jdawson**: We could do that then the whole.
**Jdawson**: The whole route on this backside.
**Jdawson**: Even leaving this undone would be nice because it'd be nice to almost just make this a.
**Jdawson**: It's a kind of an island.
**Jdawson**: But it's only this part that stuck out.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Right where your mouse is.
**Speaker 1**: Would be nice if we could leave it dirt from there down and around and just work on the dot the marina and that lagoon and have that.
**Speaker 1**: The wet area for construction.
**Jdawson**: Heck yeah.
**Jdawson**: Like to here.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: That would give us all the access we need.
**Jdawson**: Doesn't show up too well.
**Speaker 1**: Change the 25 point to 50.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So like this is phase one.
**Jdawson**: We put all this in.
**Jdawson**: That way they can be building the marinas.
**Speaker 1**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: Doing all that.
**Jdawson**: But we're not.
**Jdawson**: And.
**Jdawson**: But this is still all wide open.
**Speaker 1**: And we can run concrete trucks right to that parking structure if that's still ground.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that's right.
**Jdawson**: Running concrete trucks over this forever.
**Jdawson**: We'd probably sink our bridges.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: The bridges would get tore the hell up during construction.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I like it.
**Jdawson**: And just you work on water and then you got to worry about the.
**Jdawson**: All the.
**Jdawson**: You get in the water.
**Jdawson**: Like when we drove piles in right next to the bay here in Serena.
**Jdawson**: Like if the EPA would have come there, they'd have shut us down because that diesel fuel or whatever they use to lubricate the.
**Speaker 1**: All the farms.
**Jdawson**: The hammer.
**Jdawson**: Holy.
**Jdawson**: Like it looked like an oil slick out marina.
**Speaker 1**: I've done it in rivers so it just carries it all away.
**Jdawson**: Oh well see I didn't have that.
**Jdawson**: I had wait for the tide to get rid of it.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: I've built bridges.
**Speaker 1**: I don't know if I told you that.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that's awesome.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: I actually told him I wanted to be on the ground crew so I could learn how to build them.
**Jdawson**: Cool.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: I was out in the field doing easy for you.
**Jdawson**: Oh yeah.
**Speaker 1**: The bridges are fun.
**Jdawson**: Sweet.
**Jdawson**: So yeah they could.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Get all this marina built.
**Jdawson**: It's quite a bit of work just getting all that shit in Finish all the buildings on here, dig this out and open up.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, that's gonna cut down on the overall schedule.
**Jdawson**: A lot takes really long to get this seawall in.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: And having all that direct access like that instead of being choked off by one bridge.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Heck yeah.
**Speaker 1**: This is going to need a huge logistics calendar.
**Jdawson**: And.
**Jdawson**: Oh, phase one parking.
**Jdawson**: Phase two parking.
**Jdawson**: Phase three and a half parking.
**Speaker 1**: We're going to have to have an engineer just to babysit this.
**Jdawson**: Hell yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Deliveries and everything.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Traffic control, making sure everything's maintained.
**Speaker 1**: It will be full time secure.
**Speaker 1**: These.
**Speaker 1**: Are we going to do those cameras?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, get the cameras.
**Jdawson**: Those are awesome.
**Jdawson**: The camera yells at them and says calling the police.
**Jdawson**: And they just fucking take off.
**Jdawson**: They work like a trim.
**Jdawson**: And the cops usually show up pretty quick.
**Speaker 1**: That's perfect because a lot of these houses that are occupied are probably kind of run down.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, they're occupied with the people that break into job sites.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, that's what I mean.
**Speaker 1**: Do we got to go as far as perimeter fence around this because of that?
**Jdawson**: I think there's fence on most of these backyards.
**Jdawson**: This little half side fence.
**Jdawson**: But yeah, you probably.
**Jdawson**: You're probably right.
**Jdawson**: And that's one thing.
**Jdawson**: Like you know, we just budgeted.
**Jdawson**: You're going to have a little money in each project to chip into the site, the overall logistics plan.
**Jdawson**: But I mean we got a couple million dollars worth of shit to put in on the site just for our.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, just for operating cost.
**Speaker 1**: Because it would make probably the most sense to develop a lot of this right away when you're not fighting, trying to build that phase one and two while you're trying to build the lay down.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And we would use this for phase one and two there.
**Jdawson**: Go ahead.
**Speaker 1**: Phase one.
**Speaker 1**: That should be able to just get all that shit delivered right on the development so we wouldn't have to worry probably about lay down for phase one.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, you're right.
**Jdawson**: We come in here because I don't even know what the.
**Jdawson**: All this road is back here.
**Jdawson**: That doesn't make sense.
**Jdawson**: Like.
**Speaker 1**: I think that eight foot wall is covering.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, that's the back of the lots.
**Speaker 1**: They just got them drove in weird.
**Speaker 1**: It almost looked like that was another row of buildings on the backside.
**Jdawson**: Oh no.
**Jdawson**: I.
**Jdawson**: When I cut and pasted this over the top, we got.
**Jdawson**: This is the back.
**Jdawson**: This line is the back side of those.
**Speaker 1**: Just these lots, Those dotted lots.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Because that's going to be a big spot of clear and grub through there.
**Speaker 1**: So they can just develop that whole Thing and drop their.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Because you'll have this, you know, that's a 18 foot, 20 foot, 30 foot.
**Jdawson**: And then another looks like 18 foot, 50 foot, 60 foot.
**Jdawson**: So there's like 60 or 70ft from the back of the property to the front of the building.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: You can drop your lumber for each building right in front of it.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Speaker 1**: I mean, you can probably do that for phase two also and then move them right into the lay down after.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Phase two here.
**Speaker 1**: Because then you'd be developing that road.
**Speaker 1**: Access road right above it, below the lay down.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, just develop all that with phase two.
**Jdawson**: Oh, but we're in a need like this.
**Jdawson**: Like, we'd have to start day one on all this because we're building the island immediately, aren't we?
**Speaker 1**: Oh, yeah, that's right.
**Speaker 1**: Execute the logistics plan right away.
**Speaker 1**: Get them going on phase one, and then just start hammering because they're going to have probably a lot more equipment than just to push around one.
**Speaker 1**: That phase one area.
**Speaker 1**: I would think they're.
**Speaker 1**: They're going to have scrapers and dozers and all kinds of shit there.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: It'Ll make.
**Speaker 1**: It'll be quick work if they have a row of scrapers.
**Jdawson**: Well, all right.
**Jdawson**: What else?
**Jdawson**: I got a OAC starting here in five minutes.
**Jdawson**: I do have this one.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I got plenty of stuff to stay busy for a while.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So they.
**Jdawson**: We have to send this back in.
**Speaker 1**: So if you could prioritize this.
**Jdawson**: I'll get the.
**Jdawson**: Did I send this to Danny?
**Jdawson**: God damn it.
**Jdawson**: God damn.
**Jdawson**: I need to send this.
**Jdawson**: Danny.
**Jdawson**: Sa.
**Speaker 1**: Dude, I got a $6 fan on Amazon for my desk and it's incredible.
**Jdawson**: Really works good?
**Jdawson**: Oh, yeah.
**Speaker 1**: It's 80 degrees in my office because of the computers and the monitors run.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So I just sent that to him.
**Jdawson**: So we got to finish that.
**Jdawson**: So if you want to work on the.
**Jdawson**: I think it's the impact fees and anything you find about.
**Jdawson**: About permit fees based on that chart and get that over to Brandon and he'll get it to them guys and then when I get.
**Jdawson**: Hopefully get something from these design guys.
**Jdawson**: Otherwise we'll just do some average numbers.
**Jdawson**: I think easily it.
**Jdawson**: I mean, it's got to be 40 million worth of design on this, don't you think?
**Speaker 1**: Or is that low for the whole thing?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: That'S probably pretty fair.
**Jdawson**: Because if you think of like the townhomes, that'd be kind of cheap or the apartments, because they're.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Not that much.
**Jdawson**: But the condos, those are each going to be several million dollars each.
**Speaker 1**: The water stuff, the hotel, the civil.
**Jdawson**: Is going to be a couple million.
**Speaker 1**: It's one.
**Speaker 1**: Just call it 50.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, well, I'm just saying, like, that little hotel for Savannah, we're at 1.5 million or something for the total design costs.
**Speaker 1**: Just for the hotel.
**Jdawson**: Hotel and the courts and stuff.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, the whole development.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Oh, yeah.
**Speaker 1**: The 40 is probably safe for this.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Because we're like 10 of those, so.
**Speaker 1**: So you want me to get that impact fee schedule out first and then do this?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, do that.
**Jdawson**: And then work on this and then.
**Jdawson**: Oh, this.
**Jdawson**: We were just using, like, this.
**Jdawson**: We used to do our.
**Jdawson**: Like.
**Jdawson**: Because we gotta add.
**Jdawson**: You know, we should really.
**Jdawson**: And again, I don't know how much detail we want to do because they're just going to add in the design fee.
**Jdawson**: We just want to confirm that and then the permit fees and impact fees.
**Jdawson**: That's it.
**Jdawson**: Impact fees, permit fees.
**Jdawson**: Do some research, see if there's any other.
**Jdawson**: Like, do they charge per dollar amount of work?
**Jdawson**: Do they charge per square foot for the actual permit fee?
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: Awesome.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Speaker 1**: Thank you.
**Jdawson**: Thanks.
**Jdawson**: We'll see you.
**Speaker 1**: See you.
