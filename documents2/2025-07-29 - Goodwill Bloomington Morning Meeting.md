## Transcript
**Jcurtin**: Hey, morning.
**Jcurtin**: Yo.
**Jdawson**: Hey, morning, Jack.
**Jdawson**: How are you doing today?
**Jcurtin**: Good, good.
**Jcurtin**: How you doing?
**Jdawson**: Doing fine.
**Jdawson**: What do you have going on today on site.
**Jcurtin**: Today?
**Jcurtin**: Flooring guys will look to polish the receiving area from the vestibule south.
**Jcurtin**: So that area will be.
**Jcurtin**: Flooring will be done out of the way by the time the framers start framing over there, which their material is looking to get on site on Thursday to start framing out these windows.
**Jcurtin**: The donation vestibule.
**Jcurtin**: Glenmark's gonna finish topping that out today.
**Jcurtin**: They started hanging that yesterday with plywood.
**Jcurtin**: They also got some chair rail and a couple more places of chair rail and baseboard to install.
**Jcurtin**: I got a Goodwill low data guy on site.
**Jcurtin**: Electricians tying up some things, painters finishing up paint in the rooms.
**Jcurtin**: McRae & Sons is going to come back again today.
**Jcurtin**: He's going to put concrete on that bottom, opening the donation vestibule so I can set the track on it.
**Jcurtin**: And.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, that's everything going on today.
**Jdawson**: Hey, Jack.
**Ksipe**: Good morning.
**Jcurtin**: Hey, morning, jdawson.
**Jdawson**: What is.
**Ksipe**: What's going on with that door install?
**Ksipe**: There's some indecision on the concrete and under the threshold being done.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, that's.
**Jcurtin**: That's the big thing, is just the concrete being done on it, which McRae's going to come back and do today.
**Jcurtin**: They filled up the holes with the same concrete that they used for the sidewalk.
**Jcurtin**: And then Rick said he's got another concrete that's smoother with less rock in.
**Ksipe**: It.
**Jcurtin**: To then about fill it up about half inch and have it flush with the finished floor, and then we can set the track on it tomorrow.
**Ksipe**: Okay.
**Ksipe**: And then the whole dry being out of concrete, like, when are they pouring that for the.
**Ksipe**: Under the canopy?
**Jcurtin**: He's looking to start that this upcoming Monday.
**Ksipe**: And Nick, have you sent anything to Andrew's back today?
**Ksipe**: Did we discuss with him what we're doing there and why?
**Jdawson**: No, we.
**Jdawson**: We can talk about it, I guess, during the OAC meeting.
**Ksipe**: Okay.
**Ksipe**: Well, it just needs to be.
**Ksipe**: Hey, the foundations were designed a little too high, and, you know, our steel was already fabricated by the time this was noticed, so.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Ksipe**: You know, this allows them.
**Ksipe**: I mean, it's a better thing because it's, you know, it's obviously way more sturdy than asphalt, and it's going to leave a nice finish, but we just need to have that RFI showing the limits of it, what it looks like, and just have it documented.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And you.
**Jdawson**: Do you have an updated schedule, Jack?
**Jcurtin**: Everything but the mason, because he can't lock in a date yet.
**Jdawson**: Well, what did the Mason say.
**Jcurtin**: He just said that the.
**Jcurtin**: The start date had weather not delayed us back there.
**Jcurtin**: He was ready then, but then he had to man another job.
**Jcurtin**: And basically he's waiting for that job to be finished and trying to.
**Jcurtin**: He's trying to work things out.
**Jcurtin**: But he said as of right now, he doesn't have anybody that can start it right now.
**Jcurtin**: He said soon, but he just doesn't want to tell me a false date and then be wrong.
**Jcurtin**: And I was like, I mean, are we thinking no longer than, like, couple days or like, no longer than a week?
**Jcurtin**: He was like, somewhere in that range.
**Jcurtin**: A week or a couple days to a week.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And the canopy in the other areas, do you.
**Jdawson**: You have those updated on a schedule?
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, as long as Rick finishes up and starts to concrete on Monday.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Are you able to send out a schedule this week to the.
**Jdawson**: To the subcontractors?
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, definitely.
**Jdawson**: Where are you at as far as finishing up the canopy and in the building so we can get the tco?
**Jcurtin**: I mean, it's.
**Jcurtin**: It's coming along.
**Jcurtin**: I mean, last week's subcontractor meeting with csc, Cole was letting us know that he's way far ahead.
**Jcurtin**: He's down on the sales floor.
**Jcurtin**: He's just got to get back into the receiving area, which the flooring guy's taking up that area right now.
**Jcurtin**: But he plans on applying polish from the vestibule south today by noon, so that'll open things back up for csc.
**Jcurtin**: But still.
**Jcurtin**: And as far as fire alarm goes for TCO and the canopy, once I get that concrete poured and everything underneath, landmark's gonna come under there with a scissor lift, shoot up, install their dens glass, and then I'll have.
**Jcurtin**: Have it wrapped in EFIS, and they'll run their EFIS all the way down to Rick's concrete.
**Jcurtin**: Little column base, like little cubic.
**Jcurtin**: But yeah, I mean, we're looking.
**Jcurtin**: We're looking good right now.
**Jcurtin**: The framing for the windows is going to start either this Friday or Monday, and it'll take them about a week and a half, and then we'll be ready come that Saturday for.
**Jcurtin**: For the window company.
**Jcurtin**: And the window company said that they'll work just once, that they'll.
**Jcurtin**: That they actually have openings on Monday and Tuesday, the 18th and 19th.
**Jcurtin**: So.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Is there a date you're trying to hit for the final TCO inspection?
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, it's.
**Jcurtin**: It's still that same one originally that I sent out on the schedule.
**Jcurtin**: That hasn't changed.
**Jcurtin**: At the third week of August or fourth week of August.
**Jdawson**: Is there anything you, you need from me on site?
**Jdawson**: Any change orders or like design things?
**Jdawson**: I know there's the awnings which I'm going to send goodwill.
**Jdawson**: The change order options today, the metal canopy versus the fabric.
**Jdawson**: Okay, but is there anything else you can think of, Jack?
**Jcurtin**: No.
**Jcurtin**: She, the awning lady called me yesterday and said if you wanted to do 7 inches in height on the awning, we would just need a stronger support.
**Jcurtin**: And I was like, well, you would be tying into tube steel.
**Jcurtin**: And she was like, yeah, that would work for me to still keep.
**Jcurtin**: But then I told her no, no, just, just keep it at, keep it at a foot.
**Jcurtin**: Because she said that with the tube steel that could still support the three foot projection.
**Jcurtin**: But I was just like at this point I was like, no, we're just going to keep it at 12 inches.
**Ksipe**: Yeah, because you're not going to be tying into the tube steel.
**Ksipe**: It's like behind the framing of the wall and the ES and all that, you would then you'd have to tear that ES out, put blocking in there.
**Jcurtin**: Well, that is what that is.
**Jcurtin**: What the awning company did ask us was to confirm that there is blocking behind the ethos even if we do 7 or if we do 12.
**Ksipe**: Well, is there.
**Jcurtin**: Glenmark, when they're, when they go to frame the windows is they're going to look and see.
**Jcurtin**: That's what Griffin told me.
**Ksipe**: Okay.
**Ksipe**: Because if it's not, they're gonna have to either put three quarter plywood.
**Ksipe**: I don't know if that's enough, but you're gonna have to do something.
**Ksipe**: And while the EFIs guy is fixing the EFIS, then it's gonna have to be done.
**Ksipe**: But yeah, so before you get that full price for the awnings, we need to verify that like when are they going to start cutting them open?
**Jcurtin**: He said best case right now is looking like his material is going to show up Thursday.
**Jcurtin**: But I mean after I apply the polish to the floor today, you know, maybe come as early as tomorrow, I can have them at least start cutting it open and us getting ahead to see what it looks like.
**Ksipe**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: It'D be silly to just wait till Friday just because of material when they can at least cut it open and see at least at least one section as like a mock up.
**Ksipe**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: Alrighty.
**Jcurtin**: Sweet.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: All right, I'll talk to you guys later.
**Jcurtin**: All right, thanks y'.
**Ksipe**: All.
