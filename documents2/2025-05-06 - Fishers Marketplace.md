## Transcript
**Wes**: Hey.
**Wes**: Hey, Wes.
**Speaker 1**: Hey.
**Speaker 1**: How are you, man?
**Wes**: Good.
**Wes**: Nice to talk to you.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, absolutely.
**Speaker 1**: I appreciate you jumping on this, man.
**Wes**: Yeah, for sure.
**Wes**: Yeah.
**Wes**: I don't know how.
**Wes**: How well you know Blake, but I met Blake a few years back when we were first kind of starting in the.
**Wes**: In the business.
**Wes**: And we've.
**Wes**: He's a good guy.
**Wes**: I use him on.
**Wes**: Pretty much try to use them on all my sprinkler work.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, we just.
**Speaker 1**: I kind of got him looking around because we didn't like ours maybe about two years ago.
**Speaker 1**: And he has been fantastic and everything that he's done with us so far.
**Wes**: Yeah.
**Wes**: Yeah.
**Wes**: Blake's demand.
**Wes**: Good dude.
**Wes**: So tell me real quick before we dive into it, a little bit about your company, if you don't mind.
**Speaker 1**: So we.
**Speaker 1**: We own and manage most of our stuff over.
**Speaker 1**: Let's see, probably four border in states.
**Speaker 1**: We were in other ones before, but small commercial retail strip centers.
**Speaker 1**: Very similar to the one you looked at in Fishers.
**Speaker 1**: That's kind of our M.O.
**Wes**: Okay, cool.
**Wes**: Well, I didn't know if you knew this, but we.
**Wes**: We're national design build gc, so we get.
**Wes**: We have a Tampa Bay office and Indianapolis is our.
**Wes**: Our headquarters, for lack of a better term.
**Wes**: But yeah, so any.
**Wes**: Anything out of state, if you guys ever need help on.
**Wes**: On.
**Wes**: On projects, whether it's remodeling or just a little maintenance like this, happy to help.
**Wes**: You know, we're all about relationships just like everyone else, so phone call away.
**Wes**: We travel really well.
**Wes**: We have traveling superintendents, so.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Awesome.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: And we.
**Speaker 1**: Like I said, so we do have two up in that area.
**Speaker 1**: We have another one over kind of by like topgolf over that area.
**Speaker 1**: So pretty close.
**Wes**: Cool.
**Wes**: Well, let me share my screen real quick.
**Wes**: I took some pictures when I was there.
**Wes**: Have you been to the.
**Wes**: The building recently?
**Speaker 1**: Yes, I was there a week before.
**Wes**: So what happened?
**Wes**: That.
**Wes**: That's crazy.
**Wes**: I saw the glass was still out.
**Speaker 1**: Doordash, what they claim was a doordash driver.
**Speaker 1**: They were.
**Speaker 1**: They got their foot stuck on the gas and hit it.
**Speaker 1**: But I would think you'd be having to go about 30, 40 miles an hour to go through it the way they did.
**Speaker 1**: But.
**Speaker 1**: So, yeah, that's.
**Speaker 1**: That's what they were.
**Wes**: They did some damage.
**Wes**: So I was.
**Wes**: Yeah, I was able to meet with.
**Wes**: With.
**Wes**: With the tenants.
**Wes**: So, I mean, it's really.
**Wes**: It's really not much.
**Wes**: Much work if it is what I.
**Wes**: What I think you're wanting.
**Wes**: Essentially, I did poke my head above the ceiling, so.
**Wes**: So this does go all the way to the deck, which is good.
**Wes**: That saves a lot of cost there.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, it was two spaces before and they joined into it.
**Speaker 1**: But it was prior to us owning this.
**Wes**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: We just didn't know exactly, especially H Vac and stuff like that, how they reworked it or anything else.
**Wes**: Yeah, unfortunately, I think with creating two separate spaces, I would have to get with my architect, but I think we will have to permit this.
**Wes**: In other words, I would have just said we'll just demise it and be done right.
**Wes**: But I think we may have to permit it for use reasons.
**Wes**: I don't know if you have any experience with that.
**Speaker 1**: I don't know that I do, at least in this state, let's put it that way.
**Wes**: Okay, well, I'll make sure.
**Speaker 1**: Like Kentucky.
**Speaker 1**: And obviously this has been a while, but when it was set up as a separate address before, we didn't have to, I don't think.
**Speaker 1**: But again, it's been years since I probably did.
**Speaker 1**: But the best I remember I thought we didn't have to because it was separated in a physical address like that.
**Speaker 1**: The separate suites before.
**Wes**: Is it.
**Wes**: Is this one separated?
**Wes**: I didn't even look at the numbers.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, there are two separate listed suites.
**Wes**: Oh, then yeah, that helps for sure.
**Wes**: Okay, so.
**Wes**: So you, you just want, correct me if I'm wrong, you just want to create two separate spaces here.
**Wes**: So we'd infill this.
**Wes**: This window.
**Wes**: This window, these two cutouts obviously remove the trim, drywall finish.
**Wes**: And then.
**Wes**: So that's 1, 2, 3, 4 openings I saw.
**Wes**: I was just taking a picture of kind of what the flooring looked like there.
**Wes**: This is back in their space kitchen.
**Wes**: Okay.
**Wes**: So we would have to infill right here.
**Speaker 1**: So it looks like to me, at least when I was there, that three compartment sink, what they said they had before, it basically was just shifted and like turned right where basically that wall would.
**Speaker 1**: That opening would be.
**Speaker 1**: And it was there and then had the wall behind it.
**Speaker 1**: That's what they had.
**Speaker 1**: Correct.
**Speaker 1**: So they said that plumbing was already there and then they just kind of tapped off that and then moved it to the way they have this picture.
**Speaker 1**: Yep.
**Wes**: So we'll have to probably move a little bit of plumbing and demo this knee wall right here.
**Wes**: Other than that, that would be the only scope.
**Wes**: I.
**Wes**: I wasn't going to plan on giving them this metal or anything like that.
**Wes**: You want to leave that up to them to.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I think I'd be okay with that.
**Wes**: Okay, so we'll leave that.
**Wes**: We'll leave that up to them to take care of.
**Wes**: Yeah.
**Wes**: Here's just another picture of what that area looks like.
**Wes**: And then I did take a picture of.
**Wes**: Of this area.
**Wes**: We're going to have to move some sprinkler heads.
**Speaker 1**: So this is the one that actually is in the other space.
**Speaker 1**: Correct?
**Speaker 1**: The one that they're.
**Speaker 1**: So we and her talked about that one, especially since the electrical panel was in there that obviously fits this space.
**Speaker 1**: She was like, I'd really like to have that.
**Speaker 1**: I.
**Speaker 1**: I just kind of said when we were meeting, I don't think it's possible.
**Speaker 1**: I think it's going to be way too complicated to have this little cut in hallway, especially electrical panels.
**Speaker 1**: So when we talk, she goes, yeah, it probably is.
**Speaker 1**: Never mind.
**Speaker 1**: So I just kind of went ahead and mixed that one really fast.
**Wes**: Yeah.
**Wes**: She didn't mention anything about moving an electrical panel or creating access to this electrical panel.
**Speaker 1**: So, yeah, I think this side is going to stay with the other side.
**Wes**: Well, shouldn't the other side have its own panel?
**Speaker 1**: I didn't, and it does.
**Speaker 1**: I think if you go back to one of those pictures that had like, the mop, sink and stuff like that, I think theirs was over in that side.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I think it's over, like to the right of this over there.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Both panels.
**Speaker 1**: So I do know there's two.
**Wes**: Yeah.
**Wes**: So.
**Wes**: So what we could do is I could, like, put an allowance in there for maybe reworking some electrical west.
**Wes**: That way we can get circuits switched over so it's all on the same panel.
**Wes**: Because you don't want to have some of her circuits on the other.
**Wes**: Okay.
**Wes**: But yeah, I would.
**Wes**: As far as fire sprinkler goes and MEPs, I mean, we'll have to move a couple lights.
**Wes**: I think that all the diffusers are fine.
**Wes**: Here's your thermostat, I believe that serves this space.
**Wes**: It was really just this little hallway here.
**Wes**: It doesn't have a sprinkler, so we'll have to probably add ahead to create some coverage there.
**Wes**: Because right now it wouldn't pass if we were to have a fire commercial walk through there.
**Speaker 1**: Did they have one before?
**Speaker 1**: And then maybe that wall right there.
**Speaker 1**: They just added that wall.
**Wes**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Is there a sprinkle head on the other side?
**Wes**: Yep.
**Wes**: See it right there?
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: So is that how it passed before then when they did that?
**Speaker 1**: I would agree it does.
**Speaker 1**: It shouldn't pass.
**Wes**: I don't know how it passed because even with this, I mean, you can't have a sprinkler head that close to the wall.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Wes**: So I don't know if they added this wall after the fact or what.
**Speaker 1**: It almost looks like it.
**Wes**: It does look like.
**Wes**: It gets unfinished and then they put FRP on it.
**Wes**: So any finishes in this area, you just want to demise it.
**Wes**: And that way you can start having people tour and rent it out.
**Speaker 1**: Absolutely.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Because we don't know what it's going to be, and obviously it's a franchise or something else.
**Speaker 1**: They're going to get it like a fish, so.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Speaker 1**: Kind of see what we're going to have there.
**Speaker 1**: We just wanted to know it, you know, her ass is, can they split them.
**Speaker 1**: We just want to kind of see is this an insane thing to do or is this not as crazy as we think?
**Speaker 1**: Because it was already two spaces, and we just kind of wanted to see what that is, to see if we could help them out in that way.
**Wes**: Yeah.
**Wes**: Yeah.
**Wes**: So I can just throw.
**Wes**: I can throw a pretty quick budget together for you, Wes, to see if it makes sense, you know, instead of reaching out to sub.
**Wes**: You know, I.
**Wes**: I take pride in getting pretty.
**Wes**: Pretty damn close, so.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I think that's perfect, man.
**Wes**: Okay.
**Wes**: I'll throw a little budget together with the.
**Wes**: With the.
**Wes**: With a small scope.
**Wes**: If you give me till Friday, I'll have that to you.
**Speaker 1**: Absolutely.
**Speaker 1**: No, that'd be great, man.
**Speaker 1**: I appreciate it.
**Wes**: Cool.
**Wes**: And I'll just put some allowances in there.
**Wes**: Kind of call.
**Wes**: Call around, ask.
**Wes**: I'll ask.
**Wes**: I'll ask Blake what he thinks that ahead, it won't be that much.
**Wes**: And then, you know, a little allowance for reworking some electrical circuits and then drywall and finish on the inside.
**Wes**: Moving that plumbing is pretty easy.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Like I said, I figured this one would be a little easier.
**Speaker 1**: And then obviously the next one, whenever we got to fit it up for tenant, is where the.
**Speaker 1**: The complicated comes in.
**Wes**: But it's all good.
**Wes**: Happy to help.
**Wes**: So I'll put this together.
**Wes**: Expect something Friday.
**Wes**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: That sounds great, man.
**Speaker 1**: I appreciate it.
**Wes**: All right.
**Speaker 1**: Thanks, Wes.
**Speaker 1**: Thank you.
