## Transcript
**Nick**: Good morning.
**Ashton**: Morning.
**Housh**: Who's.
**Housh**: Hi, Jesse.
**Housh**: How we doing?
**Housh**: Good morning.
**Jdawson**: Who.
**Housh**: Hi, Nick.
**Ashton**: Hey, how's it going?
**Nick**: Awesome.
**Housh**: Good.
**Jdawson**: Okay, I'm gonna pull up the comments.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: One of the things we had questions on is this is saying the minimum width needs to be 36ft.
**Jdawson**: And we're hoping to have these as one way drives.
**Jdawson**: So we were thinking it doesn't need to be 36ft because I believe this comment is for two two way drives.
**Jdawson**: What is your take on this?
**Housh**: Nice.
**Ashton**: If it's one way, I believe it can be shrunk.
**Ashton**: But you're gonna have to make that.
**Ashton**: You'll need to add this some additional information.
**Ashton**: Like you'd have to have signage, obviously you have the arrow, but like, you know, signage that says enter, enter only on the other side.
**Ashton**: Do not enter or no turn or whatever, but the minimum with it.
**Ashton**: But I believe the minimum width there is 22ft.
**Nick**: Do we need that enter only sign?
**Nick**: Because you know, typically you put a sign that says don't enter.
**Nick**: Having an inner sign doesn't really mean.
**Ashton**: Anything to say anyone.
**Ashton**: Something that states, you know, can't turn or not an entrance, not an entrance or something because they've had people do this before and then people go both ways and then Indy's gotta try to come back and say you didn't.
**Ashton**: This isn't what it's supposed to be.
**Ashton**: So they, they need clear visible striping and signage that really clear up that this is not an exit.
**Housh**: Okay.
**Nick**: Okay.
**Ashton**: I don't really care what signage it is.
**Ashton**: I mean, they don't have a standards of it.
**Ashton**: If you put not an exit or whatever, you know, just some type of signage that that arrow is good.
**Ashton**: Maybe you put an only arrow north or east, you're fine.
**Ashton**: But you'll need some signage and the striping as is.
**Ashton**: But then you, I think you have it at 21 and a half feet.
**Ashton**: It's got to be 22.
**Ashton**: That's a, that's a fire code.
**Nick**: 22Ft width would be for one way in.
**Ashton**: Yes.
**Nick**: Okay, Nick, we can accommodate that.
**Jdawson**: We already have these installed, don't we, Jesse?
**Housh**: No, no.
**Ashton**: Okay.
**Nick**: And the radius would still be 20ft, right in.
**Nick**: Is that correct?
**Ashton**: Yes, that's, that's what they want.
**Ashton**: I mean this stuff, you can ask for variances.
**Ashton**: I don't approve the variances.
**Ashton**: I have to forward them on to DPW Transportation.
**Ashton**: They're fairly quick, unlike Stormwater with the reviews.
**Ashton**: I don't, I don't know, they may say 15 is fine.
**Ashton**: I don't I don't know.
**Ashton**: But any variance obviously adds time and there's always a chance they could deny it, so.
**Ashton**: But you're more than happy to file a variance then I would forward on.
**Nick**: We can give you the 20ft radius, however that is only in a right of way.
**Nick**: Is that correct?
**Ashton**: Yeah.
**Nick**: So we can give you 20ft from the edge of curb to the property line and then from there we can sort of break it and make it a different radius.
**Ashton**: You could do that, I guess, or taper it.
**Ashton**: It's not ideal, but that's between you and your engineer.
**Ashton**: But it has to be 20 within the RADI, within the right of way payment section should match the figure document I gave you.
**Ashton**: I think Miller Avenue is probably a local road and the walks have to meet.
**Ashton**: And either the N dot, since this is more of a one way road, they got either give me the N ADA ramp N detail or you can use the N dot drive transition details.
**Ashton**: They're a little like.
**Ashton**: For example, there's no detectable warnings on these ramps.
**Ashton**: You should remove all, all legends symbols hatching.
**Ashton**: And if they're on A detail, put a note that ADA detectable warnings are not required because Indy only wants those at stop control and that wouldn't be the case here.
**Nick**: Okay, so no detectable warnings at the sidewalk and traffic.
**Ashton**: Right.
**Ashton**: Really need to show that you're meeting the slopes and the dimensions.
**Ashton**: So the walk's gotta be 6ft.
**Nick**: 6Ft current current walk I think, I'm.
**Ashton**: Not sure if the current walks five and he wants the ramp to be six and you gotta taper back in.
**Ashton**: If you're going right against the curb, it's got to be six.
**Nick**: I see.
**Ashton**: Okay, I understand it's kind of stupid, but I don't make the rules.
**Ashton**: But it would be 6ft for the ramp transitions.
**Ashton**: You would taper it to the five foot existing.
**Ashton**: And you need enough information with gray shots and slope arrows showing that.
**Ashton**: Okay, your cross slopes are less than 2 or 2% or less.
**Ashton**: Your ramps are 8.3% or less with dimensions of the walk and the ramp and all that good stuff.
**Ashton**: That's what we're looking for.
**Ashton**: And at the cross across the drive also.
**Ashton**: So not only the ramps, but that when they're walking across the drive that the drive slope either matches Miller Avenue slope or meets ADA pro rack.
**Ashton**: Or that and the cross slope is 2% or less.
**Housh**: Okay.
**Housh**: Okay, that's awesome.
**Nick**: One other question.
**Nick**: The radius in of course is 20, but we're not leaving from the site.
**Nick**: So what would be the radius out.
**Nick**: What is the minimum we can use?
**Nick**: Because really again, we're not leaving the site so that.
**Ashton**: Well, they don't have standards for that.
**Ashton**: So Indy has a pretty basic commercial standard.
**Ashton**: So they just use 20 for everything.
**Ashton**: It's a good, good question.
**Ashton**: Makes sense.
**Ashton**: But we don't, they don't have a standard so they just rely on 20 for everything.
**Nick**: Okay, awesome.
**Nick**: All right, so I think we have understood common number and then comma number eight.
**Nick**: Would you close that door, please?
**Nick**: This dog is killing me.
**Housh**: Thank you.
**Nick**: So restoration when we're not, we're not planning on going into the drive aisle.
**Nick**: We're just planning on removing that curb and replacing it.
**Nick**: So I don't, we don't any work.
**Ashton**: Adjacent to the road which would require removal of curb, which you're going to have to remove the curb, put the drive in.
**Ashton**: Requires Indianapolis restoration, which is in their overall ordinance.
**Ashton**: We get pushback on this, but you're not going to get a variance.
**Ashton**: This is Indy made it quite clear further restoration ordinance.
**Ashton**: So anything in front of this drive will require one travel lane width.
**Ashton**: So that would be your east lane 12ft or if it's 11 or whatever, half lane, whatever that equates to.
**Ashton**: And it needs to be milled and resurfaced.
**Ashton**: That's where that requirement comes from.
**Ashton**: You would, you would be subject to that.
**Nick**: Really.
**Housh**: Okay.
**Housh**: All right.
**Nick**: So we just milled the pavement and replace it exactly where it was.
**Nick**: Because there is really no great change.
**Ashton**: Well, when you.
**Ashton**: I don't know how good your contractor is, but when they rip that curve out, they're going to damage the pavement in that area.
**Ashton**: And their issue is that when they come back to patch it, it's not going to be very good.
**Ashton**: That's why they want the mill and resurface one travel lane in.
**Ashton**: So once again 12ft.
**Ashton**: If it's a standard 24 inch road, if it maybe is a 20 foot wide road, then you only need to go to 11ft.
**Ashton**: It's just where the half width of this road is.
**Ashton**: And you would mention that width.
**Housh**: Does it go past like where we cut it or does it stop and start right there?
**Ashton**: They don't have any requirements.
**Ashton**: So it's up to you.
**Ashton**: So wherever the drive and you're probably going to wherever the walks are going, you're probably going to disturb this the curve for the walk.
**Ashton**: So wherever your walk tie into your sidewalk is, is where your limits of your curve adjacent road limits could be you would go from that south to north on travel lane in with the mill and resurface limits and the keynote according.
**Ashton**: Okay, so who does that makes.
**Ashton**: That makes sense.
**Ashton**: Yeah.
**Housh**: If you go over like another foot on each end just to make sure they don't mess it up a little bit on the milling.
**Housh**: Okay.
**Nick**: All right.
**Nick**: And of course you are now going to require MOT plan, right?
**Nick**: Maintenance of traffic.
**Ashton**: I don't require any MLT plan.
**Ashton**: That's up to the contractor during the inspectors.
**Ashton**: And in that scenario he'll have to file a right of way permit.
**Ashton**: Working the right way permit that's done during construction by the contractor.
**Ashton**: And at that point MLT plans would be required at this phase, we don't require them.
**Ashton**: You can include them if you want, but I'm not here to review motion.
**Ashton**: Okay.
**Ashton**: It's usually between the contractor and inspector if it's a major road job, like say a subdivision where they're doing a full intersection and diesel exo lanes and yes, they're typically.
**Ashton**: That's not the case here.
**Housh**: Okay.
**Nick**: So I think really that was the only concerns we had.
**Nick**: The exit is will just basically convert existing two way driveway into like a single driveway there.
**Nick**: And that also needs to be 22ft out, right?
**Ashton**: Yes, 22ft is any standard for minimum, I believe one way.
**Housh**: Okay.
**Ashton**: Some places it's 20, I think fire code's 20, but ending wants 22.
**Housh**: All right.
**Nick**: Then some signage that says don't enter or exit only.
**Ashton**: I mean exit only maybe, or not exit only.
**Ashton**: Whatever size is best.
**Ashton**: You want to use that, you know, so like on Michigan street, if you're adding one and you would have do not enter on the going facing north and then on the south side, you know, whatever.
**Ashton**: You probably need any signage on the one to the west, you know, sign saying, you know, not.
**Ashton**: Not an exit or whatever.
**Nick**: Yeah, we'll have to put some signs in our property that says don't enter right at the gate because you know, we don't want people from our property trying to leave from there.
**Nick**: So that's going to be an out only.
**Nick**: Therefore we'll probably put two signs, one on each side of that driveway to say do not enter.
**Nick**: And then we put two signs up there by Michigan to say do not enter because it's exit on in the right way at the right right away light.
**Nick**: So everything else is good, right, Nick?
**Ashton**: I mean, depending on you answer the questions.
**Ashton**: Yeah, I mean without.
**Ashton**: If you understand what's going on.
**Jdawson**: You.
**Ashton**: Just need to revise the plans.
**Nick**: Yeah, we're going to revise with a.
**Ashton**: Response letter, upload it To a seller.
**Ashton**: Let me know when they've been uploaded to a seller and then it'll get added to the queue and then we'll review it.
**Ashton**: And if there's more comments, I'll send more comments.
**Ashton**: If there aren't any comments, then I will let you know there aren't any comments.
**Ashton**: And it's been recommended for approval to BNS and BNS will send you the official approval permit for your drive.
**Housh**: Okay.
**Nick**: Okay.
**Nick**: And then the sidewalk on the Millie Avenue, I think we just remove it to the closest expansion or contraction joint.
**Housh**: Right.
**Ashton**: I mean that's typical.
**Ashton**: I mean typically on surveys they don't.
**Ashton**: Unless it's an N ADA ramp survey.
**Ashton**: You're not, they're not gonna, you're not gonna have the, have the joints.
**Ashton**: But you know, you can put a note that says to the nearest joint, you know, past the limits.
**Ashton**: Obviously what's going to control is your ramp slopes and whatever tie in.
**Ashton**: But if you want to put a note that says, you know, they can go further north or south to the experience joint, that's fine.
**Ashton**: Typically that's a field adjustment.
**Housh**: Okay.
**Ashton**: So that's not a big deal for this phase of it.
**Ashton**: It's more the make sure the drive meets the manual for pavement type and dimensions and that the ramps meet ADA pro wag or this is more of a drive transition.
**Ashton**: But it's got to meet the slope requirements.
**Nick**: At the driveway and the road.
**Nick**: Nick, on Millie, would you require like a valley curb or can we just bring the, bring this concrete to the edge of pavement?
**Ashton**: What curve is existing?
**Nick**: I think it's like a upright 6 inch curb.
**Nick**: Right.
**Ashton**: Now if it's a straight curve, straight curve, 6 inch straight curve, then ND will typically allow you just to take your pavement section and butt up to the other pavement section.
**Housh**: Okay.
**Ashton**: This was chair back curb and gutter.
**Ashton**: Then you would have to put depressed curb and gutter in.
**Ashton**: But I don't think that's the case for this road.
**Housh**: Yeah.
**Nick**: Okay, wonderful.
**Nick**: So Jesse and Nick, do you all have any further questions for Nick?
**Jdawson**: I don't.
**Housh**: Nick, I appreciate you getting on here with us.
**Housh**: This has been like, it's been a six month journey here trying to get this thing done.
**Ashton**: So.
**Nick**: So the right of way use permit is pulled by the contractor and then the rest of it I guess is a site permit is what I'm understanding.
**Ashton**: Well, any improvements to the project requires an ILP improvement location permit.
**Ashton**: That's through planning, that's done separate.
**Ashton**: We don't, we're not involved in that.
**Ashton**: So you would.
**Ashton**: And for something this small, I don't know if IOP would require or not.
**Ashton**: That's typically up to planning.
**Ashton**: We, as we do design a lot of design work as well.
**Ashton**: In Indy, we always have the architect file the IOP and reach out to planning.
**Ashton**: But you.
**Ashton**: That's a separate permit.
**Ashton**: They may reach out and say, you know, you need a drainage permit, but since the new state laws.
**Ashton**: This doesn't require drainage permit.
**Ashton**: You would tell them as such.
**Ashton**: The drive permits.
**Ashton**: What we're reviewing is what's required by BNS tpw.
**Ashton**: You'll get a separate approval permit for the drive.
**Ashton**: Those you would get from now and during construction, depending on the inspector, the contractor, what he's.
**Ashton**: He's required to file.
**Ashton**: File the work in the right of way permit.
**Ashton**: So he's.
**Ashton**: He does that himself.
**Ashton**: Typically the engineer and the client's not involved.
**Ashton**: And they work with the inspectors in the city directly.
**Ashton**: They get their right of way permit.
**Ashton**: At that time, they may require an mot.
**Ashton**: That's.
**Ashton**: That's after the fact, see.
**Nick**: Okay, one last question.
**Nick**: Just came to my mind.
**Nick**: That 22ft, and I know your fire trucks are 20, right.
**Nick**: With that 22ft, can that be at the right of way and then kind of narrow it down to 20 on our property?
**Ashton**: Yeah, per code, the 20, the 36, 22 is at the right of way.
**Ashton**: So technically, from a drive standpoint, it's at the right of way line.
**Ashton**: So yes, you can taper back in.
**Ashton**: Planning has requirements for 20 and 22 and fire, but I'm not reviewing that.
**Ashton**: That's a.
**Ashton**: Because it's internal to the site.
**Ashton**: So if planning allows it to be 21 and a half internally or they tell you you don't need an ILP, then then you're fine.
**Ashton**: The 36, 22 is at the right of way.
**Housh**: Okay.
**Ashton**: So in theory, yes, you could taper it down.
**Housh**: Okay.
**Nick**: Nick, you have helped us out so much this morning and just can't thank you enough.
**Ashton**: Yep, no problem.
**Ashton**: If you got another question, just leave me a call.
**Housh**: All right?
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Thanks, Nick.
**Nick**: You have a good.
**Ashton**: Thank you.
**Housh**: Thanks, Nick.
**Housh**: See ya.
