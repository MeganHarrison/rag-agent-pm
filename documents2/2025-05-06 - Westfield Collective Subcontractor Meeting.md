## Transcript
**Awoodhams**: Morning guys.
**Awoodhams**: Morning.
**Brhoades**: Ryan.
**Awoodhams**: Looks like you guys are going to be finishing up storm today.
**Kpeters**: Should be.
**Kpeters**: Yeah.
**Awoodhams**: Okay.
**Awoodhams**: When are you guys gonna go back and hit your under drain?
**Kpeters**: Not gonna do that for a while.
**Kpeters**: You're talking about the spider drains?
**Awoodhams**: No, not so much.
**Awoodhams**: The spider coming out of like 606.
**Awoodhams**: You've got an underground that comes out of there a good ways for the roof drain.
**Kpeters**: Let me go look which one.
**Kpeters**: See which one you're talking.
**Kpeters**: None of that.
**Kpeters**: I'm gonna put.
**Kpeters**: I'm not gonna put any of that in until we determine how the the pavement looks.
**Kpeters**: Unless you want me to.
**Kpeters**: The only problem with putting that stuff in, if that thing has to be stabilized, you can get into filling that up.
**Leel**: Okay.
**Kpeters**: That's how we typically do it.
**Kpeters**: You know we just had one down here in a multifamily job in Whiteland where they wanted us to put them in.
**Kpeters**: We that's not a great idea because.
**Awoodhams**: You'Re afraid you'll hit it if you go to the line.
**Kpeters**: Correct.
**Kpeters**: So then the teller comes in and just till them all up and put them right back in.
**Awoodhams**: All right.
**Kpeters**: So just my thinking now, if you want me to do something different, we can.
**Awoodhams**: Now you're good.
**Awoodhams**: So right now I've got you guys basically finishing up the storm today.
**Awoodhams**: You're good with that?
**Kpeters**: Yep.
**Awoodhams**: And then it looks like you guys are moving into sanitary next.
**Kpeters**: Correct.
**Awoodhams**: And then I've been said you guys are going to be doing the boring for the water on 58 this Thursday.
**Kpeters**: Yeah.
**Kpeters**: Yes, that is.
**Kpeters**: That did get moved up.
**Kpeters**: So they'll come.
**Awoodhams**: How many days are you going to need for the domestic water and fire line total?
**Awoodhams**: Yeah.
**Kpeters**: I think we have like nine days in it.
**Kpeters**: Let me double check real quick.
**Awoodhams**: And sanitary also.
**Awoodhams**: What are you thinking you're gonna need for it?
**Kpeters**: Give me one second, I'll pull up my schedule.
**Awoodhams**: Lee, are you on here?
**Brhoades**: Yes sir.
**Awoodhams**: Hey, what are you thinking?
**Awoodhams**: Are you guys are still coming in Thursday for your.
**Awoodhams**: The rammed aggregate, Pierce?
**Awoodhams**: Correct.
**Brhoades**: That was the plan I got.
**Brhoades**: I was reading wrap ups this morning in our drill rig for the crew that's ahead of you is being delayed by trucking that's supposed to get to that job site this afternoon.
**Brhoades**: I'll keep you updated on when that job finishes.
**Brhoades**: I realistically I think it's going to be like Monday next week.
**Awoodhams**: Okay, so Monday.
**Ryan.wanninger**: And just jumped on to Chad about that transformer pad we were just talking about.
**Awoodhams**: No, I was talking about the rammed aggregate.
**Awoodhams**: Pierce.
**Ryan.wanninger**: No, on our phone call, I mean.
**Awoodhams**: Oh no.
**Awoodhams**: I'm not.
**Ryan.wanninger**: So you're saying Brendan jumped on so we can talk to you about the.
**Leel**: Yeah.
**Awoodhams**: So, Lee, you're saying the 12th you guys will be here?
**Brhoades**: That's what I see at the moment, yes.
**Awoodhams**: And it's going to take you guys how many days for that pad?
**Brhoades**: I'd say three days, maybe two.
**Brhoades**: Three would be.
**Brhoades**: Three would be the ideal.
**Leel**: Okay.
**Kpeters**: Once these AG peers are in, are we able to drive equipment over them?
**Brhoades**: Yeah, you guys can just treat it like normal pad after that.
**Kpeters**: Okay.
**Brhoades**: The only thing we ask is that when you're digging, you use a bucket with.
**Brhoades**: You use a smooth bucket and not a tooth bucket.
**Brhoades**: And so you're not mixing that soil and aggregate right at the top of the pier.
**Kpeters**: Okay.
**Kpeters**: All right, Good to know.
**Leel**: Yeah.
**Awoodhams**: So you guys be in here that week.
**Awoodhams**: Okay, that puts you out.
**Awoodhams**: Brennan, when are you guys looking to come in and start your underground for electrical?
**Leel**: Well, I guess it.
**Leel**: When do you.
**Leel**: When do you want us in there?
**Awoodhams**: Well, Ryan, you'll have the site pretty much cleaned up and cleared where they can start their.
**Awoodhams**: Their underground also.
**Awoodhams**: When?
**Awoodhams**: Next week.
**Awoodhams**: At the end of next week.
**Awoodhams**: Ryan, you'll have everything cleaned up out here, weather permitting.
**Kpeters**: Yeah, into next week.
**Kpeters**: So I got about six days into water.
**Kpeters**: So you're looking towards the end of next week.
**Kpeters**: We'll be done with water.
**Kpeters**: Sanitary.
**Kpeters**: Got five days.
**Kpeters**: So we're still two weeks out on sanitary and water.
**Awoodhams**: So that means the week of the 19th that Dean can come in and start running their electrical for all their underground stuff.
**Awoodhams**: Correct.
**Kpeters**: I guess I haven't seen the.
**Kpeters**: The electrical plan here.
**Awoodhams**: There's not a whole bunch.
**Awoodhams**: It's just a few light bulb bases.
**Leel**: We have control points marked out.
**Kpeters**: Yes, they are.
**Leel**: Okay.
**Leel**: I'll have to get my trimble guy out there.
**Leel**: You said the week of the 19th?
**Awoodhams**: Yeah, that.
**Awoodhams**: That would give Ryan two weeks to get everything in and the site cleaned up.
**Kpeters**: Really depends on what kind of soil we're dealing with in your parking lots.
**Kpeters**: That's going to be the big kicker here, how all that dries out.
**Awoodhams**: Well, this whole week we have dry weather, so let's take advantage of that.
**Awoodhams**: Definitely.
**Kpeters**: Well, if it dries out.
**Awoodhams**: If it dries out.
**Kpeters**: Yeah, yeah, I can keep hammering utilities out.
**Kpeters**: This is a.
**Kpeters**: There's not much I can do with wet subgrid, so.
**Awoodhams**: So you'll have fire hydrants and PIV and everything installed also Then, Ryan, are.
**Kpeters**: You coming back for those about two.
**Kpeters**: In two weeks we'll have all that.
**Kpeters**: That' be in.
**Leel**: Are you.
**Leel**: Are you guys Going to run a, a PVC conduit to the piv?
**Kpeters**: No, I was not planning to do that.
**Awoodhams**: No.
**Awoodhams**: Do you need one ran over there running it?
**Leel**: It probably will need to be monitored.
**Leel**: So.
**Leel**: Yeah.
**Leel**: If I get you the conduit, can you guys put it in with the pipe?
**Kpeters**: Yeah, if that's what they want us to do.
**Leel**: Okay.
**Kpeters**: Out there.
**Awoodhams**: What's that?
**Kpeters**: Is there any other conduit that needs to be ran out there?
**Ryan.wanninger**: No.
**Awoodhams**: You don't have any conduit out there?
**Awoodhams**: Correct.
**Leel**: Should just be one.
**Leel**: One, like three quarter, one inch to the.
**Leel**: To monitor it?
**Kpeters**: Yeah, yeah.
**Kpeters**: If you get that out there, we can, we can put it in.
**Leel**: Okay.
**Kpeters**: Or even if you want me to supply it, just tell me what diameter you want.
**Kpeters**: I can go get it.
**Leel**: That.
**Leel**: Honestly, that'd be easier.
**Leel**: Yeah.
**Leel**: Three quarter or one inch?
**Leel**: Either one would be fine.
**Kpeters**: Okay.
**Kpeters**: Do you prefer poly or does it matter?
**Leel**: It don't.
**Leel**: It don't matter.
**Awoodhams**: And the grease trap?
**Awoodhams**: Ryan, do you guys have that?
**Kpeters**: It's on order.
**Awoodhams**: It's on order.
**Awoodhams**: Do we have a target date of when it's arriving?
**Kpeters**: No, I'm waiting until we see how this, this tie in goes here.
**Awoodhams**: The tie in with the sanitary.
**Kpeters**: Yeah, no, I won't.
**Kpeters**: I won't have a day.
**Kpeters**: I mean, it'd be ready here this week if I was ready for it, but.
**Awoodhams**: Okay, so it's not gonna be a long lead time.
**Kpeters**: No, it's all.
**Kpeters**: That thing's on order.
**Kpeters**: It should be.
**Kpeters**: That should be ready by end of the week.
**Leel**: Okay.
**Ryan.wanninger**: Did you get the pricing and stuff for that ride?
**Kpeters**: Did I send that over to you?
**Kpeters**: No, I did not.
**Kpeters**: I'll get that to you.
**Ryan.wanninger**: All right, thanks.
**Awoodhams**: Okay, I've got merit is here on site with me.
**Awoodhams**: Glenn, what's the status of permit for building?
**Ryan.wanninger**: I filed for the ILP last Thursday.
**Ryan.wanninger**: They said it's about a 10 day turnaround.
**Ryan.wanninger**: I believe they have everything that they need with the exception of the platting to combine the parcels that we're working on.
**Ryan.wanninger**: That was approved by the board a few weeks ago, so I'm just trying to get a final status on that.
**Ryan.wanninger**: They said it would not hold up our ilp, but they also said it would, so.
**Ryan.wanninger**: Last thing we're really waiting on is the cdr.
**Ryan.wanninger**: State cdr.
**Ryan.wanninger**: I'm expecting that any day this week to be released.
**Ryan.wanninger**: So you're expecting that this week, the cdr, yeah.
**Awoodhams**: Okay, so best case, when do you think we'll actually have a permit in hand?
**Awoodhams**: So Merrick can schedule?
**Awoodhams**: Because he's got holes right now in his schedule and it sounds like.
**Awoodhams**: So if we can take advantage of that, that helps him and that helps us.
**Ryan.wanninger**: Yeah, I'm pushing.
**Ryan.wanninger**: I'm pushing right now for the 23rd still for them to get started, but, you know, without having the CDR and the platting done.
**Ryan.wanninger**: Out of my control with the platter.
**Ryan.wanninger**: But next week.
**Ryan.wanninger**: That's gonna be next week.
**Ryan.wanninger**: I'm hoping to get the ILP issued.
**Awoodhams**: Glenn, are you sending their shop drawings once you get the rebar shops, are you sending those to Jericho?
**Awoodhams**: Are you just reviewing those yourself?
**Ryan.wanninger**: I think Jerrica has to stamp off on them.
**Awoodhams**: Okay, so as soon as we get merit shops.
**Awoodhams**: Did she give you an idea of time.
**Awoodhams**: Time frame on turnaround?
**Ryan.wanninger**: He's been turning around those submittals in a couple days.
**Awoodhams**: A couple days back?
**Ryan.wanninger**: Yeah, yeah, Maybe.
**Ryan.wanninger**: Maybe less since we know we're working on.
**Ryan.wanninger**: On it coming.
**Ryan.wanninger**: Did she.
**Ryan.wanninger**: What's the.
**Ryan.wanninger**: I haven't seen my emails yet today.
**Ryan.wanninger**: It's been a hectic day for me.
**Ryan.wanninger**: Got in a car accident this morning and I haven't seen Lee.
**Ryan.wanninger**: Did we get our shop drawings back to add those actors?
**Brhoades**: Yeah, I responded to that RFI this morning.
**Ryan.wanninger**: Okay, perfect.
**Ryan.wanninger**: Perfect.
**Awoodhams**: All right, we'll give it back.
**Awoodhams**: Okay, so we're still shooting for merit on the 23rd.
**Awoodhams**: Ryan's going to be wrapped up with all of utilities by the 19th, correct.
**Kpeters**: Ryan by the 19.
**Awoodhams**: That's not this coming up Monday.
**Awoodhams**: It's the following.
**Kpeters**: Not with the grease trap.
**Kpeters**: Was not in there.
**Kpeters**: So really, if you want to count grease trap and all that in there, I'd go 21st.
**Kpeters**: 22nd.
**Kpeters**: Now really, I would put that data like for me being finished with utilities around.
**Kpeters**: Yeah, the 21st or 22nd.
**Awoodhams**: 21St.
**Ryan.wanninger**: Got it.
**Brhoades**: All right.
**Awoodhams**: And then once you're out of the way, then Brennan and Dean can come in and get all their underground in, correct?
**Kpeters**: Yes.
**Kpeters**: We haven't done anything with the parking lot, just so you know, main.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah.
**Awoodhams**: So when do you plan on.
**Awoodhams**: When do you want to try to start reshaping that mud hole once it dries out?
**Kpeters**: Yeah, I can't.
**Kpeters**: I wish I could give you an answer.
**Kpeters**: I.
**Kpeters**: I hope by next week.
**Kpeters**: But tell us see what that dirt does it.
**Kpeters**: It was still pretty wet yesterday when I was out there.
**Leel**: Okay.
**Ryan.wanninger**: So we talked about getting up under the gravel concrete or the gravel pad that we have now, the existing parking lot.
**Awoodhams**: So when.
**Ryan.wanninger**: When is it a realistic time to move that trailer over where that sanitary is tied in and then get that gravel Pad up and get under there.
**Kpeters**: Ryan, next week.
**Ryan.wanninger**: Next week.
**Ryan.wanninger**: Okay.
**Kpeters**: Yeah, because it looks pretty good the rest of this week.
**Kpeters**: I think we should have some good weather here for a week.
**Kpeters**: Hey, where do you want that Condor rain?
**Kpeters**: I see where the PIV is on the edge of that building.
**Kpeters**: Where do you want the con or the conduit ran to?
**Leel**: We just need to get it in the building or whatever's easiest.
**Kpeters**: Okay.
**Kpeters**: So, Glenn, I would need your riser room today.
**Kpeters**: The corners, or as long as.
**Kpeters**: Or if, you know.
**Leel**: Ideal.
**Leel**: But you can always.
**Leel**: If you just get it in the building, we can run it from there to the rising room.
**Ryan.wanninger**: Got it.
**Kpeters**: So as long as it's in the.
**Kpeters**: In the walls, you're good?
**Leel**: Yeah.
**Kpeters**: Okay.
**Kpeters**: All right.
**Kpeters**: Easy enough.
**Kpeters**: You're.
**Kpeters**: You're talking very short little st here.
**Awoodhams**: Then.
**Leel**: Site contractor, just because you're already there digging.
**Kpeters**: Yeah, it's easy.
**Kpeters**: We put Condor there, no problem.
**Kpeters**: Okay.
**Awoodhams**: Any other delays or issues, Ryan, on your end?
**Awoodhams**: Nope.
**Awoodhams**: All right, so, Lee, you guys are.
**Awoodhams**: Next week.
**Awoodhams**: You'll be in and out of here in three days, correct?
**Brhoades**: That's the plan.
**Awoodhams**: Okay.
**Awoodhams**: Can you shoot me your site foreman's phone number so that way I can get a hold of him so I can kind of show him a video of the pad to make sure he's happy with everything.
**Awoodhams**: That way he doesn't get here and needs something else done.
**Brhoades**: Yeah, I can do that.
**Awoodhams**: All right.
**Awoodhams**: Thank you, sir.
**Awoodhams**: All right, that's it, guys.
**Awoodhams**: We're gonna still shoot for the 23rd.
**Awoodhams**: So, Glenn, the permits, you're on that, correct?
**Ryan.wanninger**: I'm working on it.
**Awoodhams**: All right, that's all I've got today.
**Ryan.wanninger**: All right, thanks, guys.
**Ryan.wanninger**: Oh, Brandon, Brendan, we had the transformer pad.
**Ryan.wanninger**: We need to get that planned out and get with Duke about scheduling them to come and get our transformer set.
**Ryan.wanninger**: What's.
**Ryan.wanninger**: Chad, you mentioned the submittal that we got to turn into Duke?
**Awoodhams**: No, we need.
**Awoodhams**: We need Duke's shop drawing of the pad of the transformer pad.
**Ryan.wanninger**: Oh, got it.
**Awoodhams**: Every.
**Leel**: I think they're gold bug.
**Leel**: So.
**Ryan.wanninger**: Say again, Brendan?
**Leel**: Duke's gold book.
**Leel**: And it shows all that information.
**Ryan.wanninger**: Okay.
**Ryan.wanninger**: Is that something you could share with me?
**Ryan.wanninger**: Are you able to email me that, Brennan?
**Leel**: Yeah, yeah, sometimes.
**Leel**: There's like, three cast ones they bring out, sometimes before.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah.
**Awoodhams**: Do you know, Brennan, has.
**Awoodhams**: Has Duke been using precast ones, or they actually been casting place pads lately?
**Leel**: Usually they don't care.
**Leel**: The way we can do it ourselves or buy a precast.
**Leel**: They.
**Leel**: They usually don't care.
**Leel**: Okay.
**Awoodhams**: All right.
**Awoodhams**: Anything else outstanding from anybody, I guess.
**Brhoades**: Glenn, should I expect that submittal back today or tomorrow for approval?
**Ryan.wanninger**: Hopefully it gets back today.
**Ryan.wanninger**: Jerrica was on that rfi, too, so if you replied to the rfi, then she would have gotten an alert.
**Ryan.wanninger**: So I'm gonna.
**Ryan.wanninger**: I'm pulling back up here to get onto a computer today, and I will get with her and get it back to you, but.
**Awoodhams**: Awesome.
**Ryan.wanninger**: The other one was good.
**Ryan.wanninger**: So this one, I mean, don't hold up the deployment or anything?
**Brhoades**: No, no.
**Brhoades**: I.
**Brhoades**: I just needed to check my box.
**Ryan.wanninger**: Gotcha.
**Ryan.wanninger**: Yeah, I'll get it back to you as soon as I can.
**Awoodhams**: Perfect.
**Ryan.wanninger**: All right.
**Awoodhams**: All right, that's it.
**Awoodhams**: Let's just keep.
**Ryan.wanninger**: Did Merrick give us the rebar shop drawing day?
**Leel**: Do you have an idea?
**Awoodhams**: They just sent it out yesterday for rebar shop.
**Awoodhams**: So you're probably looking at at least three days before you get a rebar shop back.
**Leel**: Yeah.
**Awoodhams**: Minimum three days.
**Ryan.wanninger**: Yeah.
**Ryan.wanninger**: What's your lead time on bar?
**Ryan.wanninger**: On getting bar out there?
**Leel**: After conservatively said two weeks, he said it's probably eight days.
**Ryan.wanninger**: All right, so we're right there on track.
**Awoodhams**: All right.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah.
**Awoodhams**: So, I mean, as of right now, as long as everything hits and you get the permits, we should be able to at least get started that week of the 23rd.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah.
**Ryan.wanninger**: All right, guys.
**Ryan.wanninger**: We'll keep pushing.
**Ryan.wanninger**: Thank you.
**Awoodhams**: All right.
**Awoodhams**: Thank you, guys.
**Ryan.wanninger**: See you.
