**Adelgado**: Georgia, this is a licensed one.
**Adelgado**: It's a seal.
**Adelgado**: But this is not June.
**Adelgado**: So you saw what we need to change.
**Adelgado**: So I asked Brandon to send us that because we couldn't download it from Friday.
**Adelgado**: Jesse.
**Adelgado**: So basically what we sent was, okay, but they need the certificate of existence and it has to say that the date that the company was established was December 14, 2021, rather than December 13, 2021.
**Adelgado**: So I asked Brandon for help so because I know he can just download it and we can pay for the certificate of existence and then that's it.
**Adelgado**: That's it.
**Bclymer**: Georgia and Arizona, it's the same problem.
**Adelgado**: No, so Georgia is.
**Adelgado**: Wait, yeah.
**Adelgado**: No, so Georgia is.
**Adelgado**: This one in Arizona is Tennessee.
**Bclymer**: That was just a question.
**Bclymer**: It was a question.
**Adelgado**: But I know, but I'm just trying to.
**Adelgado**: I'm trying to think what's the difference?
**Adelgado**: I mean, for Georgia we have that in for Arizona.
**Adelgado**: What are we waiting on?
**Adelgado**: Oh, the.
**Adelgado**: The.
**Adelgado**: To connect the.
**Adelgado**: The business, remember?

**Adelgado**: Perfect.
**Gducharme**: Goodwill, Tremont, Nick, that we just need to go over the estimate with the owner.

**Jmendez**: I Get them confused.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, no I get it.
**Bclymer**: I get it.
**Jmendez**: All right.
**Jmendez**: Forget about that part.
**Jmendez**: So but we are still working on updating the scope for this.
**Jmendez**: They're still adding more things to it.
**Ataylor**: You'll find with radial that they will always add more scope.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, it's great.
**Jmendez**: I'm beginning to see that we haven't started the submittal process yet.
**Jmendez**: Guess we haven't gotten all of the subcontractors together yet except for I think Dean that is working on the electrical, the cage.
**Jmendez**: We as of Friday we are I think we are looking for pricing for a different kind of design.
**Jmendez**: So we sent out requests for pricing on those on Friday.
**Jmendez**: That's where we are right now.
**Jmendez**: So we are reaching out to find out about permitting process.
**Adelgado**: Thank you Keva from the this is AJ.
**Ataylor**: Yeah we we met on site last week with some subs for the interior work waiting on the right of way documents to be signed by the building owner since we're changing the right away for this path.
**Ataylor**: Once I get those we'll we'll get those in Carmel's hands and we should have our permit ready to go there.
**Ataylor**: And right now I think the interior work is probably going to take two weeks.
**Ataylor**: So we have a hard stop at being done August 1st.
**Ataylor**: So here into June we'll probably mobilize and start.
**Adelgado**: Awesome EVA radial.
**Adelgado**: Avon.
**Jmendez**: Avon.
**Jmendez**: Yes.
**Jmendez**: So this we are getting started with electrical on Wednesday.
**Jmendez**: Brandon is coming out there with JP as well and we are still working on the added scope and we are designing and looking for pricing for one of the some of their viewing platforms.
**Jmendez**: We have ordered material for all of the backdoor seals, dark door materials, the leveler, the door, the overhead doors and the fans and the lights are all ordered and we just got a quote for a new coat for the dock seals and we just approved and sent those back today.
**Jmendez**: So we have a six to eight week lead time for that.
**Jmendez**: And we are beginning demo and cutting out of the doors for the new dark doors on the 23rd and the install would follow I believe on the 30th of the month.
**Jmendez**: I think that's it for that one.
