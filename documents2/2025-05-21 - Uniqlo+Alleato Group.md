## Transcript
**Aelkarrimy**: Sam.
**Bclymer**: Hey, everybody.
**Jdawson**: How you doing?
**Jdawson**: So I think we got everybody here.
**Jdawson**: We'll go ahead and kind of get started.
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah, I think we can get started.
**Aelkarrimy**: I don't know.
**Jdawson**: So, Yuzuki, we got your email for everything, you know, for you guys to prep your employees and present to them kind of what the plan is.
**Jdawson**: So understanding the intent, we'll, like I said, get everything together so that next week in your guys's corner meeting, you know, Thursday or Friday, whenever you guys do that, everybody can be on the same page as far as egress routes.
**Jdawson**: What we're going to be doing this, that, and the other.
**Bclymer**: Okay, thank you.
**Bclymer**: But you guys are mobilizing from next.
**Bclymer**: When next Tuesday, right?
**Jdawson**: No, we'll mobilize on the second.
**Aelkarrimy**: So we'll.
**Jdawson**: We'll have.
**Aelkarrimy**: Guy.
**Aelkarrimy**: We'll.
**Jdawson**: We'll have June 2nd.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, so that's what.
**Jdawson**: Last meeting, we pushed it back to June because I think that's when you said you get into the states, correct?
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So, yeah, so that's when we've got that.
**Jdawson**: So the.
**Jdawson**: The eight foot fence is.
**Jdawson**: Is ordered.
**Jdawson**: We don't have a delivery date just yet.
**Jdawson**: So as soon as we get that, then obviously we'll.
**Jdawson**: The guys will come install that as well.
**Jdawson**: But yeah, so we'll plan on.
**Jdawson**: You said Mike will be there that week of the second, starting to get stuff moving.
**Jdawson**: And then ideally the permit is approved by then.
**Jdawson**: I know that talking with the city, they're still in review.
**Jdawson**: They're not really giving any timeline, and if they did, I wouldn't trust it.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Hopefully they will provide us the permit at the latest.
**Bclymer**: Next weekend, I guess.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I mean, that's what I pushed.
**Jdawson**: I pushed the schedule back to be, you know, to.
**Jdawson**: To.
**Jdawson**: To simulate a permit coming next week.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I mean, that's.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So that, that's if.
**Bclymer**: That's why you put the mobilization after the permit.
**Jdawson**: Correct.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And how about the kick, like kickoffs presentation you're going to provide to our.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that's what I just said.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: So I got your email last night.
**Jdawson**: And so the.
**Jdawson**: We'll put everything together so that come next week when you guys have your corner meeting or whatever, Thursday or Friday, you guys can have it.
**Jdawson**: So we'll get everything put together and then send it to you.
**Jdawson**: And then next Wednesday, you know, you can ask whatever questions and we can change anything or whatever.
**Jdawson**: And then that way, you know, Thursday or Friday, whenever you guys have your meeting, it'll be ready.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And that's online, right?
**Jdawson**: What's Online.
**Bclymer**: Is that online kickoff or is somebody coming in person or.
**Jdawson**: No, no.
**Aelkarrimy**: What?
**Jdawson**: From my understanding, like, the.
**Jdawson**: The.
**Jdawson**: The meeting that you're wanting is, you know, so that you guys or whoever's on the ground for your warehouse can say, hey, guys, you know, here's the work that's going to be going on.
**Jdawson**: The work hours are going to be, you know, roughly six to six.
**Jdawson**: And, you know, we're going to have 50 people on site.
**Jdawson**: They're going to be in this area.
**Jdawson**: Your egress route adjustment will be here.
**Jdawson**: You know, here's, you know, some signage that you may see.
**Jdawson**: You know, construction area.
**Jdawson**: Here's some of the things that'll be going on.
**Jdawson**: So don't be alarmed and just essentially brief your people.
**Jdawson**: Is that the intent?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, something like that.
**Bclymer**: But you can do it in presentation in the meeting room to our, like, warehouse team and the 3 PL team.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, so I guess something like that.
**Jdawson**: Are you wanting us to present it to them or from my understanding, you want it, like, either way, it's fine.
**Jdawson**: I'm just not sure what one you want.
**Bclymer**: Oh, yeah, you.
**Bclymer**: You can just explain to our team.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: So you want us to present it.
**Jdawson**: So do you know when do you guys have your corner meetings typically?
**Jdawson**: Or is it just a random scheduled thing?
**Bclymer**: Oh, it's not.
**Bclymer**: Kind of like you're going to explain to our, like, all of the workers in the warehouse, like, for the, like the manager of our warehouse team who.
**Bclymer**: Who instruct to each workers.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so you want.
**Kevin.ly**: So you're presenting.
**Kevin.ly**: You're presenting to Uniqlo fast retail and 3PO.
**Kevin.ly**: And then they will take your presentation and that information and.
**Kevin.ly**: And present it to the warehouse folks.
**Jdawson**: Ah, okay, now.
**Jdawson**: Now that makes more sense.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: All right, so then, yeah, we can.
**Jdawson**: We'll get something put together to present them, and then that way they can give it to everybody else.
**Jdawson**: I mean, I guess they're all.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we don't have to do it.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, they're all local, obviously, right?
**Jdawson**: Correct.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yep.
**Aelkarrimy**: Perfect.
**Jdawson**: Okay, then.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I'd say we'll shoot for.
**Jdawson**: I'd say probably Wednesday morning.
**Jdawson**: So I'll have.
**Jdawson**: We'll get our guys and everything.
**Jdawson**: And so we'll shoot for Wednesday morning, I guess, if.
**Jdawson**: If that works.
**Jdawson**: Use.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: For you and your team.
**Jdawson**: Double check some schedules and let me know.
**Jdawson**: But I.
**Jdawson**: If we could do it Wednesday morning, I think that's.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: When.
**Bclymer**: When?
**Bclymer**: Neck.
**Bclymer**: You mean next Wednesday, right?
**Jdawson**: Correct.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, next Wednesday morning.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Kevin.ly**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So, you know, if there's some time slots that work in there, you know, let us know.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay, thank you.
**Aelkarrimy**: Perfect.
**Jdawson**: So, yeah, we'll get that materials.
**Jdawson**: We, you know, obviously a lot of it's been ordered.
**Jdawson**: The bulk of the material is, is the sprinkler and, you know, all that stuff's on order and whatnot.
**Jdawson**: We don't have any, any delays on that.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: So current rfi.
**Jdawson**: So request for information.
**Jdawson**: So I brought this up earlier to Ahmed, talking to him.
**Jdawson**: I'll go ahead and pull up the, the drawing here.
**Aelkarrimy**: So a question.
**Jdawson**: Question.
**Kevin.ly**: I'm sorry, but Brian, is.
**Kevin.ly**: Is Luther on the call?
**Kevin.ly**: I don't see him.
**Mparsons**: No.
**Mparsons**: I had told him that I would cover unless we need to pull him in for, for specific questions.
**Mparsons**: So.
**Kevin.ly**: Because he's going.
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah, because Brandon's about to just go over some sizes of pipes.
**Kevin.ly**: So I'm not sure if you're going to be able to.
**Kevin.ly**: To chime in on those, but if you are able to, that's cool.
**Kevin.ly**: But if not, we, we might need Luther for this one.
**Kevin.ly**: Go ahead, Brandon.
**Kevin.ly**: I'm sorry about that.
**Jdawson**: And you can always relay the information if we don't know, and we'll, you know, we can always send an rfi, you know, follow up.
**Jdawson**: So looking at here, so obviously, you know, we, we have all these, you know, heads for all the combustible cardboard that changed in, in the, the permit set.
**Jdawson**: And so it looks like.
**Jdawson**: I don't know if this is a typo or if the calcs just made you guys up this pipe size.
**Jdawson**: Do you know.
**Mparsons**: Let me go back to my notes.
**Mparsons**: I, I know we had dropped that pipe in size at one point.
**Aelkarrimy**: And.
**Mparsons**: I don't remember if we dropped from eight to six or six to four.
**Jdawson**: So we went from six to four to eliminate any reinforcement.
**Jdawson**: But that was before we had.
**Jdawson**: That was with not all these heads.
**Jdawson**: So I don't know if you.
**Jdawson**: I haven't seen any hydraulic caps come out yet for this.
**Jdawson**: I don't know where you guys are at in that, that pursuit.
**Jdawson**: So I just didn't know if you did the calcs.
**Jdawson**: And it very well may be that by adding all those heads, the calcs are forcing you to up the pipe size until you get to this turn.
**Mparsons**: Calc should be done.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Is there a way, is there a way you can share those with us?
**Jdawson**: I don't.
**Jdawson**: I mean, they haven't been submitted unless you guys send them to the city.
**Jdawson**: They don't have.
**Aelkarrimy**: We did.
**Bclymer**: We did.
**Kevin.ly**: They were part of the.
**Kevin.ly**: Oh, wait, Brian, you guys sent it to me and that was the big PD.
**Kevin.ly**: The 8.5 by 11 calculations, right?
**Aelkarrimy**: Yep.
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah, so those were submitted to the city as well.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Kevin.ly**: And I think Luther just joined the call, Brian.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yep.
**Mparsons**: Yeah, I pinged him.
**Mparsons**: He still on board?
**Mparsons**: Thanks for jumping on Luther.
**Aelkarrimy**: Problem.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: All right, cool.
**Jdawson**: I'll look in our file.
**Jdawson**: Maybe we just must.
**Jdawson**: I must have missed it when I was looking earlier.
**Jdawson**: Anyway.
**Jdawson**: Hey.
**Jdawson**: So, Luther, looking at this, I didn't know if this was a typo, this 6 inch line here or if that was intentional.
**Jdawson**: You know, I didn't know if you had to upsize that pipe because of these added heads or what that was.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah, give me just a second.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Flip the calcs so I can double check on that.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Because I thought.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I thought I was able to reduce it all down to 4 inch.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So that might actually be a typo.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that's what I was thinking as well.
**Jdawson**: But I.
**Jdawson**: I didn't want to speak out of turn.
**Mparsons**: Brandon, on the other half of the system.
**Mparsons**: Are we showing.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So I mean, I figured One of the two is wrong.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: For showing 4 inch on the longer run, that.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: That should be right.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I'm pulling up the calc file right now to look at it.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I just didn't know what loss you had on the 90s and stuff, if that played a factor or what.
**Jdawson**: But yeah, I would assume if this one can be.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah, no apologies.
**Jdawson**: That was just.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: That's just a typo.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: That is supposed to be 4 inch the whole way through.
**Aelkarrimy**: All right, cool.
**Jdawson**: So Kava, make a note of that and let's get update on our material list because obviously that's going to change this.
**Jdawson**: Pipe hangers, all the.
**Jdawson**: All the stuff.
**Jdawson**: So let's make sure we capture that.
**Jdawson**: Okay, cool.
**Aelkarrimy**: All right.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Six inch riser, though.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Correct.
**Jdawson**: It should be six inch up the wall and then 92 of four.
**Jdawson**: Yep, that is correct.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: That is what it's supposed to be.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So I apologize.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: That is a typo.
**Jdawson**: Yep, no worries.
**Aelkarrimy**: All right, cool.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that was the.
**Jdawson**: That was the biggest thing.
**Jdawson**: So then that also alleviates the structural component from that, which is good.
**Jdawson**: Okay, let's see here.
**Jdawson**: So, yeah, so there's the answer on that.
**Jdawson**: And then Yuzuki will be submitting our first billing here.
**Jdawson**: Does that go to you or who am I sending the bill to?
**Bclymer**: The bill.
**Bclymer**: You can send it to me and Kevin.
**Jdawson**: You and Kevin.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay, I will shoot that to you guys.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, no real current, obviously job site update as of now.
**Jdawson**: The only thing I would ask is, Joe, did you get confirmation on for remediation.
**Bryan.wagar**: They're out there right now doing a more evasive survey in order to avoid having to screed the floor.
**Bryan.wagar**: So the plan is to do a more intense survey, then come up with a remediation plan that we're still on track to start the beginning of June.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Let us know what they find out, if you would, please.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: What about any, any update or change in your material delivery?
**Jdawson**: You still looking to hit and start beginning August?
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, we're still looking for material to start showing up that first week of August and start building within the first week.
**Aelkarrimy**: Perfect.
**Jdawson**: Are you, you're, you're, Are you sending a guy out like a week early to.
**Jdawson**: To lay out?
**Bryan.wagar**: Yes, we'll have, we'll have somebody come out a week early.
**Bryan.wagar**: I still need to schedule that.
**Bryan.wagar**: It's more one person with a robot that will draw all the X's on the ground of where all the.
**Bryan.wagar**: Basically the holes will go and they'll lay everything out, right?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: If you can, let us know as soon as you can.
**Jdawson**: Because we need to schedule our electrical to obviously coincide with that, because as soon as you guys draw that out, we're going to throw lasers and, you know, put the lights in their final spots.
**Jdawson**: So Michael, make note of that.
**Jdawson**: Make sure that we have that called out and we understand when that's going to be.
**Jdawson**: That's the main drivers on the schedule.
**Jdawson**: Submittals.
**Jdawson**: I think mostly all of them were sent either via email or through job planner, I guess design team.
**Jdawson**: You guys think we can turn that around?
**Jdawson**: I don't know.
**Jdawson**: Early next week, Tuesday, maybe Wednesday.
**Mparsons**: Sorry, Brandon, what was that question on the submittals?
**Jdawson**: So do we think we can turn those around, you know, Tuesday, Wednesday, next week, or what?
**Mparsons**: Did we get plumbing for sure.
**Mparsons**: We should be able to come through that one pretty quick.
**Mparsons**: The electrical and fire.
**Mparsons**: Does that give us one, two?
**Mparsons**: Yeah, probably.
**Mparsons**: I'd say Wednesday, maybe Thursday at the latest on.
**Mparsons**: On those two.
**Jdawson**: I would say if you're gonna prioritize.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I think I can make happen.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I would say if you're going to prioritize, electrical would be good.
**Jdawson**: I mean, Luther sprinkler is pretty easy.
**Jdawson**: We have heads and heads and shields and then schedule 10 pipe.
**Jdawson**: So yeah, if you guys got any questions, let us know.
**Mparsons**: Sounds good.
**Mparsons**: Thanks, Brandon.
**Kevin.ly**: Brandon, I'm sorry, just to touch on job planner because I've never really used it.
**Kevin.ly**: Is it similar to Procore where let's say Brian reviews the plumbing and fire sprinkler, he uploads it Then I can download it and then add my notes onto it.
**Kevin.ly**: Right?
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jdawson**: It's the same exact thing as Procore.
**Jdawson**: It's just cheaper.
**Jdawson**: I gotcha.
**Jdawson**: They don't, they don't rob you like Procore does.
**Kevin.ly**: But what about like, what is the flow currently?
**Kevin.ly**: Like, does it go to Henderson first, then AUE and then tpg or what is the.
**Jdawson**: Let's see here what the workflow is.
**Kevin.ly**: Because I saw it come in via email and I only see one submittal uploaded on Job Planner.
**Mparsons**: I didn't see anything uploaded to Job Planner.
**Aelkarrimy**: So yeah, I could also not see.
**Jdawson**: Anything on our end as of yet.
**Kevin.ly**: One thing uploaded earlier under Submittals.
**Jdawson**: So we got looks like plumbing, sprinkler and electrical as far as ball and court here.
**Jdawson**: Oh, that's why.
**Jdawson**: All right, so that's.
**Kevin.ly**: You share your screen.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I'm sorry, I just want to.
**Bclymer**: See what you see.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, so we'll.
**Jdawson**: This is, this is us.
**Jdawson**: We just need to move this ball in court.
**Kevin.ly**: Ah, gotcha.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yep.
**Aelkarrimy**: So we'll.
**Jdawson**: So we'll get that, we'll get that adjusted so it hits all your guys's courts.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Kevin.ly**: And I think, I think the flow for the fire sprinkler should be Henderson just for the sizes, the shields and the specification.
**Kevin.ly**: And then I'm not sure it supports like a split submittal or is it included in that?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I mean all we're, all you're going to see is like for the sprinkler, for instance, it's just the, the beam clamps that we're going to have, you know, with the, with the mains and then the, the actual in rack stuff that, that's already done with Exotech.
**Jdawson**: So they've got pre drilled stuff and then we just come in with these U bolts and go down on it.
**Jdawson**: Same thing with the flu spaces.
**Jdawson**: Those are these little like cantilever things.
**Jdawson**: And then we just have all thread in a ring hook that attach to it.
**Mparsons**: Brandon, should I have a submittals option under Job Planner or is that going to show up on the dashboard when that, when that's ball in court for.
**Jdawson**: Henderson, it should show up on your dashboard.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So yeah, so we'll get all those pushed and then you know, if, if you don't see them or whatever, you know, let us know.
**Jdawson**: And then I think we are.
**Jdawson**: We also emailed them all out too, just to have.
**Mparsons**: So yeah, we, we did get them in, in the email, but just want to make sure we're following the most efficient process for you guys, of course, us returning those to you.
**Aelkarrimy**: Gotcha.
**Aelkarrimy**: Cool.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So we'll get all that stuff pushed and updated so that it kicks to your court.
**Bryan.wagar**: Brandon, I do have one question, and this is me just double checking myself, but as far as mechanically for the Skypod system, do you.
**Bryan.wagar**: Because you're pulling the permit with all of our basically racking drawn on there.
**Bryan.wagar**: Do I need to submit any permits myself?
**Jdawson**: No, because they don't have a separate trade for racking install.
**Jdawson**: Like, you know, some, some states they'll make you like you have to have a special trade permit license for racking install, but New Jersey doesn't have a separate one.
**Jdawson**: So I say no, of course.
**Jdawson**: This municipality who, who knows.
**Jdawson**: But technically you go underneath our master permit.
**Bryan.wagar**: Correct.
**Bryan.wagar**: Correct.
**Bryan.wagar**: And what about my, my electrical in the past I've had to pull, had to have our contractors pull their own electrical underneath the main building permit.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, you're.
**Jdawson**: You, you're your guy that's running your stuff along the conveyor.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, I mean power boxes and things of that nature.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jdawson**: Man, that's hit.
**Jdawson**: That's.
**Jdawson**: Honestly, I've seen both situations in municipalities as far as yes and no.
**Jdawson**: I would say let's see what the.
**Jdawson**: What I don't want to do it now and throw a wrench in it.
**Jdawson**: Let's see what the city comes back with.
**Jdawson**: We can always add it later because they're not going to do that electrical work for what, three months?
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, no, there's plenty of time.
**Bryan.wagar**: I just wanted to cover my bases because I, Yeah, I'm gonna attempt to hire, maybe get a couple quotes from people locally so they'll, they'll have a better idea as well.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I, I don't, I don't know is.
**Jdawson**: I guess the answer off has that question.
**Jdawson**: But you will have to have obviously somebody local considers a specific electrical license for that.
**Jdawson**: So you will have to get somebody local to, to look at and we, I mean, or you know, we can always if you want link you up with, with our electrician too.
**Jdawson**: And, and they put a number on it for you.
**Jdawson**: You can, and you can go direct with them if you want.
**Jdawson**: You don't have to go through me.
**Jdawson**: I won't, I won't do that to you.
**Kevin.ly**: Brandon.
**Kevin.ly**: Just regarding the racking, there should be a racking permit as well pulled.
**Jdawson**: Well, it's not a like, what he's asking is like.
**Jdawson**: So for instance, our electrician has a license and has to go in and like attach to that, but there is no like racking install license so that it's not a separate.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, so it's all submitted.
**Jdawson**: It'll come through as one.
**Jdawson**: It's not like a separate thing.
**Kevin.ly**: So I wanted to touch on the skyjacks and maintenance tools that are going to be required for the space.
**Kevin.ly**: So I think there was some sort of.
**Kevin.ly**: There was an email that was issued by Aliato to Uniqlo and Fast Retail regarding removing the rentals for the skyjacks and the skylifts or whatever they're called.
**Kevin.ly**: So who's providing the skylift and skyjacks for the construction or the duration of the project?
**Jdawson**: Right now they don't have any.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, right now I believe it's going to be Aliato.
**Jdawson**: We're gonna.
**Bryan.wagar**: Exotech does not have.
**Bryan.wagar**: Will not have skylifts that go in between the aisles until the first of January.
**Bryan.wagar**: And even then, it's not a guarantee that I'm going to be able to get one or two out there, but I am pushing to have that as soon as possible.
**Bryan.wagar**: There will be.
**Bryan.wagar**: We will provide what's called I for what they call it.
**Bryan.wagar**: It's like a manual single lift genie.
**Bryan.wagar**: It's not the easiest to maneuver because it is a manual push to where you put the legs out.
**Bryan.wagar**: You go up, you have to come back down, put the legs back up and then push it into the spot that does fit in between the aisles.
**Bryan.wagar**: But other than that, all our other sites have been utilizing just your regular skyjacks or lifts that you use and being able to do some of the work from the outside.
**Bryan.wagar**: We've talked with Brandon already about kind of the best way that people have been utilizing how to get the sprinkler pipe in and doing it all from.
**Jdawson**: One side basically without having like these specialized lifts.
**Jdawson**: You know, there's again, like.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I mean, we just have to try to get, you know, these other types of lists and go in and.
**Jdawson**: And work.
**Jdawson**: Now, the.
**Jdawson**: The hope was that Joe can secure some lifts for us to do it.
**Jdawson**: If not, I mean, we just have to get these genie lifts and, you know, it just.
**Jdawson**: It's painstakingly slow to get in there, but, you know, there's no other option.
**Kevin.ly**: Now the main scope that's under critical path, I think, is the main scope that needs the skyjacks to keep things in order and smooth and on time.
**Kevin.ly**: So if we're using these genie lifts, are we.
**Kevin.ly**: Are we saying, like those critical path timelines might be actually impacted at this time since we don't have skyjacks?
**Jdawson**: I can't.
**Jdawson**: I can't say that because I don't know how inefficient and slow it would take with the genie lifts.
**Jdawson**: What.
**Jdawson**: In reality, I think what we'll probably have to do is instead of everybody moving in a normal order and then coming back and doing the detailing and having everybody do that, what we'll probably have to do is detail concurrently.
**Jdawson**: So we'll just have to probably add some guys and some lifts.
**Jdawson**: And so let's say that we're whatever, 20% done with B.
**Jdawson**: Start doing detailing with, you know, a crew of four guys or something on four different lifts to do it.
**Jdawson**: That's really, I think, the only way, because otherwise.
**Jdawson**: Yes, you're, you're correct.
**Jdawson**: I mean, using those kind of genie lifts, it would, it's going to take a lot longer than using the traditional exotech lifts.
**Kevin.ly**: Now, these genie lifts, Joe, they only span up to the height of the rack or do they span a little higher?
**Kevin.ly**: Like will, will we be, be able to use these lifts for the lighting, for example?
**Bryan.wagar**: No, I, I, the single man lifts, I don't think they don't go higher than the racking.
**Bryan.wagar**: I don't think you'd want to get in them if they did.
**Kevin.ly**: All right, so then, Brandon, for the lights, are you just planning on, like we discussed, manual ladders and the.
**Jdawson**: Well, no, the lights.
**Jdawson**: We'll, we'll set those lights before they stand up the racking.
**Jdawson**: That's what I'm saying.
**Jdawson**: So Joe will come in and they'll lay out the racking.
**Jdawson**: They'll, you know, they'll have X's on the floor that says here's the center of aisle or it really.
**Aelkarrimy**: They'll mark the feet.
**Jdawson**: And so then we will come into the laser in the center of those and with normal lifts, go in and adjust it to where it's in line.
**Jdawson**: And so we'll be done before they wrap.
**Jdawson**: Stand up a single piece of rack.
**Jdawson**: Got it.
**Jdawson**: Now, when those lights go out, your maintenance will have a hell of a time changing that stuff out.
**Jdawson**: That's.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that'll be a problem, but that's the warehouse's problem.
**Kevin.ly**: Okay, so we talked about Sky Jackson Skylifts weekly construction call.
**Kevin.ly**: Yasuke, did you see the meeting agenda that was issued in the chat.
**Bclymer**: Issue?
**Bclymer**: In a witch chat.
**Kevin.ly**: In this chat, like if you click on the top where it says chat teams.
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah, hold on, hold on.
**Kevin.ly**: Cabba basically sent us the, the meeting, the weekly meeting agenda, basically in, in the chat.
**Bclymer**: Oh, the Keba mass.
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Kevin.ly**: He's with Aliata Pleasure meeting you, by the way, man.
**Jdawson**: And then.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, so he'll send out.
**Jdawson**: And he'll send out all the minutes and everything, too.
**Jdawson**: And then along with that, the.
**Aelkarrimy**: The.
**Jdawson**: You guys should be getting these Fireflies.
**Jdawson**: Minutes come out automatically, but we'll.
**Jdawson**: We'll send them as well.
**Kevin.ly**: Thank you, man.
**Bschwartz**: Sorry.
**Bschwartz**: Like, everyone.
**Bschwartz**: So I need to jump off this meeting to you.
**Bschwartz**: Like, I have another meeting, but before that.
**Bschwartz**: So, Brandon, I'm mine from Uniqlo.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Bschwartz**: It takes so long time to sign the formal contract.
**Bschwartz**: We are pushing our legal team right now.
**Bschwartz**: But I talked to our cfo, and then CFO wants to speak to you.
**Bschwartz**: Say, I apologize.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I mean, we've got that loi.
**Jdawson**: That's why we put that in position, because I don't want to slow you guys down.
**Jdawson**: So we're working off that.
**Jdawson**: You're not.
**Jdawson**: We're not slowing anything down.
**Jdawson**: I appreciate it.
**Jdawson**: I know that, you know, dealing with attorneys are a pain, so you're not.
**Jdawson**: You're not being done at all.
**Jdawson**: Everything's moving.
**Bschwartz**: Okay.
**Bschwartz**: Thank you.
**Bschwartz**: Appreciate your support.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yep.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bschwartz**: Sorry, guys.
**Bschwartz**: So I got a jump off.
**Aelkarrimy**: Thank you.
**Jdawson**: You got any questions?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, a few questions.
**Jdawson**: I have.
**Bclymer**: One is, can you give us, like, assume information about when the workers are coming in the warehouse and until when and.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: What are you saying?
**Jdawson**: Are working hours and.
**Bclymer**: And also.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, and also the.
**Bclymer**: Are you working in Thursday?
**Bclymer**: Thursday?
**Bclymer**: No, no, no.
**Bclymer**: The two.
**Bclymer**: Saturday and Sunday.
**Jdawson**: Weekends or not?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So the.
**Jdawson**: The work times will.
**Bclymer**: Because we have to.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jdawson**: The work times would be, you know, basically six to six different crews, you know, cut off.
**Jdawson**: But that's.
**Jdawson**: That's most.
**Jdawson**: And really more than likely, it's probably actually going to be less than.
**Jdawson**: I'll probably be, you know, four or five.
**Jdawson**: It's just, you know, in case things go.
**Jdawson**: I mean, Joe, what.
**Aelkarrimy**: What is.
**Jdawson**: Your.
**Jdawson**: Guys are your 6 to 6 or 6 to 5?
**Jdawson**: What is your time?
**Bryan.wagar**: We're regular working hours.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So seven to 3:30, Monday.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, well, they'll probably come in a little early, but it's generally.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, eight to five Monday through Friday.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: So, yeah, it.
**Jdawson**: You know, that's why I say six to six, Yuzuki, because you're gonna have, like, his guys are gonna start and end later than, like, our guys and certain things.
**Jdawson**: So that's a.
**Jdawson**: That's a window of when you can expect guys to be in there working.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And then as far as I need.
**Bclymer**: This information is because we wanted to put some security guys in the.
**Jdawson**: In the front.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Joe, are you guys having guys work on the weekends?
**Bryan.wagar**: No, not to start.
**Bryan.wagar**: Come the end of the year, if, if anything is falling behind, I think we built some slack into the schedule as far as holiday weeks being off and things of that nature.
**Bryan.wagar**: So we'll, we'll try to make it up there, but if not, it all depends on progress.
**Bryan.wagar**: And yeah, if the progress is slipping, we'll definitely go into the weekends and such.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, usually.
**Jdawson**: So right now it's just Monday through Friday, 6 to 6.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Obviously, as the project progresses, you know, that's why we have these calls and stuff, we'll say, hey, you know, we got guys that need to work, you know, Saturdays, you know, this time.
**Jdawson**: This time, and we can adjust.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay, I understand.
**Kevin.ly**: And then for Wednesday's meeting, what time are you guys planning on being on site as well?
**Kevin.ly**: Just so then the folks know.
**Jdawson**: So when you talk about Wednesday.
**Jdawson**: Next Wednesday.
**Kevin.ly**: Next Wednesday's meeting?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: With that.
**Jdawson**: Not on site from my understanding.
**Kevin.ly**: Oh, yeah.
**Kevin.ly**: Remotely remote.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah, it could be online.
**Jdawson**: So next Wednesday, I, you know, if.
**Jdawson**: Yuzuki, if it works for you guys.
**Bclymer**: It'S okay.
**Bclymer**: But you're sending the draft of draft documents to us on Wednesday, right?
**Jdawson**: I thought you wanted me to brief.
**Kevin.ly**: Your management team, but they want the presentation.
**Kevin.ly**: So then they can use the presentation and present exactly what you're presenting to them to the warehouse folks.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we'll.
**Jdawson**: We'll share the pre.
**Jdawson**: We'll share everything with you.
**Jdawson**: But when do you want us to speak to your management team?
**Bclymer**: Wednesday or Thursday.
**Bclymer**: I will confirm with my team internally.
**Jdawson**: Okay, well, I, it would, it would need to be Wednesday morning.
**Jdawson**: I've got a 9am Open.
**Jdawson**: If you can make that work with your team for me.
**Jdawson**: I'm booked on Thursday morning, but Wednesday morning I've got open.
**Jdawson**: Or I can do 8am Whatever.
**Jdawson**: So just confirm to the team and let me know if that works.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Wednesday morning, 9pm 9am or Thursday morning, 9am something.
**Bclymer**: Something like that.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I, I, I can't do Thursday at 9.
**Jdawson**: I'm booked.
**Jdawson**: I can do Wednesday, but if, if, if again, if only Thursday works, then Jesse or somebody else can.
**Jdawson**: Can be on it.
**Jdawson**: The rest of the team can.
**Jdawson**: Can speak to what's going on.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: I'll just confirm internally first and come back to you.
**Jdawson**: Works.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: What other questions do you have?
**Cheryl.green**: Sorry, just confirmation, though.
**Cheryl.green**: 66 means until workout will come before 6.
**Jdawson**: I think what I heard you say was 6am to 6pm Are you asking if people would come before 6am no.
**Bclymer**: Is there a possibility that worker will coming after.
**Cheryl.green**: Before 6am 6am you worker will start to work until 6am Right.
**Cheryl.green**: So worker will come before 6, a minute before or something.
**Kevin.ly**: So the warehouse opens at 6am is what I'm.
**Kevin.ly**: What I'm understanding.
**Aelkarrimy**: Right?
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah.
**Kevin.ly**: So the concern is if any of the Aliato folks Show up before 6am no one, no one's gonna be there.
**Bryan.wagar**: Right.
**Cheryl.green**: It is flexible so it, it can be.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I mean so if 6am is the starting time and that's when the building opens up.
**Jdawson**: I mean the guys will.
**Jdawson**: They'll wait in their car until 5:59.
**Jdawson**: Like they're not showing up at 5:30 to be ready for the day.
**Cheryl.green**: Okay.
**Cheryl.green**: Yeah.
**Cheryl.green**: Though we will open warehouse from 5:30.
**Cheryl.green**: Is this okay?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that's fine.
**Jdawson**: Again, I don't, I don't think you, you necessarily need to.
**Jdawson**: You know, nobody's going to be in there working before six.
**Jdawson**: That's the very earliest.
**Jdawson**: And so I, I think your six to six time frame is.
**Jdawson**: Is fine.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So we are fine.
**Bclymer**: We are.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: That.
**Bclymer**: To put the security guy from 6am yes.
**Bclymer**: In earliest.
**Jdawson**: Yep, that's fine.
**Bclymer**: Until then, if worker comes earlier, they can stay in the.
**Bclymer**: In their own car or.
**Jdawson**: Correct?
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: It won't be.
**Jdawson**: You guys don't need to do change anything on.
**Jdawson**: On your end.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: What other questions do you have?
**Jdawson**: Yuzuke.
**Kevin.ly**: I think we went over everything we discussed yesterday.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, okay, perfect.
**Jdawson**: Well, you know, Yuzuki, we.
**Jdawson**: We do these all over the country.
**Jdawson**: We're the best in.
**Jdawson**: Best in the country that do it.
**Jdawson**: That's why Exotech recommends us.
**Jdawson**: So trust me, we.
**Jdawson**: You put your trust in us, you'll get taken care of.
**Jdawson**: This thing will go off and you'll be amazed at what it's like to see this thing go up and get done.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, of course I trust you.
**Jdawson**: So cool guys.
**Jdawson**: Well, thank you so much.
**Jdawson**: You're gonna get back to me if that time works and then we'll talk next week.
