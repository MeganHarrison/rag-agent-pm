## Transcript
**Steve.fischer**: SA what are you smiling at?
**Bclymer**: This message from mike.sa.
**Steve.fischer**: Love how you strategically have Charles in the background.
**Steve.fischer**: No better backdrop than that.
**Steve.fischer**: Hey, they got a bunch of people with them, so I gotta go.
**Bclymer**: All right, sounds good.
**Jdawson**: See you.
**Speaker 3**: See ya.
**Bclymer**: What's up, man?
**Bclymer**: Hey.
**Bclymer**: How are you doing?
**Bclymer**: Well, how are you?
**Jdawson**: I'm bad in Ohio.
**Steve.fischer**: Do what?
**Jdawson**: That I'm in Ohio?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: At Hebron?
**Jdawson**: No.
**Bclymer**: Well, how's it going with the audit?
**Bclymer**: Better.
**Jdawson**: They'll start paying us.
**Bclymer**: They are going to start paying you?
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: That's good.
**Bclymer**: So they haven't paid you for anything the whole time?
**Jdawson**: Well, they started paying us in the beginning, and then when our first audit was really bad, they stopped and put a freeze.
**Jdawson**: And now apparently they're gonna pay us and back pay us, which everybody was surprised about.
**Jdawson**: The back pay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Hell yeah.
**Jdawson**: So it's a lot of.
**Jdawson**: Of money.
**Bclymer**: That's huge.
**Jdawson**: So, yeah, basically, Joe said that our CEO was like, so I don't really know exactly what's going to happen, but he was like, start buying, you know, move forward.
**Jdawson**: And, like, thing is, we don't really have any sort of schedule from them on, you know, what we need, like, if, you know, if there really is an urgency to move forward.
**Jdawson**: But I think what Joe was really looking for is just putting together more or less a refreshed kind of timeline and phased thing to help us make that decision.
**Jdawson**: And I think, you know, we just have to be very upfront about how long some of this stuff is going to take.
**Steve.fischer**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: That will help, you know, motivate everybody to move forward quickly.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I mean, you know, this is, you.
**Jdawson**: Know, not a little project.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: We'll be lucky to get it done this year.
**Jdawson**: This year, Right.
**Steve.fischer**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: So I think, like, Joe's trying to be a little bit too conservative, understandably, but also, like, I think everybody's fear is will be in good standing with them.
**Jdawson**: They'll send us some stuff, and then they'll be like, okay, we want to send you more stuff.
**Jdawson**: And we'll be like, oh, well, we're not going to be ready for six or seven months.
**Jdawson**: And then they're going to be like, well, what the.
**Jdawson**: Like, that's not what we want.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Kind of need to have it ready.
**Bclymer**: All right, well, so we'll get an updated schedule and lead times on everything, you know, and.
**Bclymer**: And shoot that over to you so you kind of know what it looks like.
**Bclymer**: So we'll just.
**Bclymer**: We'll get that adjusted and we'll just.
**Bclymer**: We'll pick a date of like, like, you know, we'll say, like, let's say, you know, assuming release on.
**Bclymer**: We'll just say June 30th.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: If that's a, you know, gives us basically July, August, you know, and then, you know, hopefully September, we would actually start the work and that would probably get you done end of January.
**Jdawson**: I think we do still have to think about, like, how we can break it up and, you know, not do it necessarily all at once, but, like, in a way that makes most sense.
**Jdawson**: So, like, I don't know.
**Jdawson**: I mean, I'm trying to think.
**Bclymer**: Is.
**Jdawson**: It just already we're having.
**Bclymer**: Say, is it just cash flow or, you know, what is it that we're trying to rectify?
**Jdawson**: I think some of it's at.
**Jdawson**: But, like, it also would feel very silly if, like, they.
**Jdawson**: We just don't ever reach the amount that they're saying and we do, like, all this stuff.
**Jdawson**: So, like, right now we're really struggling, though, keeping temperature in that room.
**Jdawson**: So, like, I don't know, maybe it's like.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jdawson**: And then when we talk about, like, all this Shane stuff, which we can talk about, like, the Phase one stuff maybe in a second, but, like, I think we have to look at, like, the drop ceiling, maybe additional rooftop units, maybe all the drops, and then maybe we just, like, don't do, like, generators and transfer switches and we kind of do them, like, as needed.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: You can definitely hold off on, like, you know, the generators, you know, because that's not going to be a huge, huge difference.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Whether you do it all at once or separate.
**Bclymer**: I mean, you see, you're going to save on the cost of the generator.
**Bclymer**: The biggest thing I think that I would be worried about or, like, hesitant to phase out is the actual transformers.
**Bclymer**: Just because dealing with Memphis Power, like, I don't know if I want to break that up and try to get lucky twice.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, no, I agree.
**Jdawson**: I mean, I think it really only seems feasible to me to just push the generator and transfer switch out and then.
**Bclymer**: I agree, I agree.
**Jdawson**: Everything else, do it.
**Jdawson**: And like, worst case, you have a big transformer that you don't use at all, and you have all these electrical drops for all these freezers and all this wiring inside the building that we don't need either.
**Jdawson**: But, like, you know, it's just.
**Jdawson**: I know we talked about, like, trying to do, like, part of the drop ceiling and part of the RTUs and all that stuff.
**Jdawson**: That just seems like it's not really going to work.
**Bclymer**: Well, I mean, no, it would not be something that's easy to do.
**Bclymer**: And it would be obviously cost prohibitive if you, you know, assuming that they do say, oh, we do need all this, and then you got to go back and do it all.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so let's kind of go forward with that plan.
**Steve.fischer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: As, as far as Shane stuff, you saw all those comments about phase one.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Because one of the things when Joe brought this up, I'm like, well, we kind of need their approval to move forward before we start some of this.
**Jdawson**: And the last thing we really, you know, we're just in this pissing match where like we gave him the feedback and they don't agree with it.
**Jdawson**: So I don't know, we have to just figure out a way to close out this phase one stuff with those comments.
**Jdawson**: And at this point, I guess if we have to do some of the stuff or like take all these extra pictures or whatever, like, let's just do that.
**Steve.fischer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, we'll.
**Bclymer**: We'll figure out a way to solve it to make them happy.
**Bclymer**: I mean, I say happy, but who knows?
**Jdawson**: And then I think we have everything else that they asked for and I think I've already sent it to them, but if we can just verify that, I mean, I can do that too.
**Jdawson**: But pulling up his email, he said there's only three.
**Bclymer**: Three bullet points.
**Jdawson**: He wants final architectural engineering for phase two stuff.
**Jdawson**: Final architect engineering, mechanical plans.
**Jdawson**: So I think we have everything there.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I mean, we do.
**Bclymer**: I'm pretty sure we have all those drawings, but we'll, I'll double check and if, you know, we'll get them if we don't yet.
**Bclymer**: But I thought we already did it all.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I definitely sent it to them, but I think they just haven't looked at it because we're still gotcha.
**Jdawson**: In this thing with the first phase.
**Jdawson**: They're just like ignoring it.
**Jdawson**: But if we can.
**Jdawson**: I don't know that I really want to respond to him until we have something to respond to him on the phase one stuff.
**Steve.fischer**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: Actually, I'll just send it to him because otherwise we're just going to not make any progress.
**Jdawson**: We need to work both these in parallel.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I mean, you know, the, the letter thing, I mean, that's just.
**Bclymer**: Okay, like, so we just need to add one word there and then the other two comments.
**Bclymer**: Like, okay, you know, if we gotta add some supports or whatever, like.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Speaker 3**: Hey, Steve, on that email, the response, this goes in order from red is theirs, green was ours, and blue is the initial.
**Bclymer**: Blue is the latest.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Blue is their feedback to the green.
**Speaker 3**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So red was their first feedback months and months and months ago.
**Jdawson**: Green was what you guys gave me and I passed on maybe like, I don't know, two months ago or a month ago.
**Jdawson**: And then the latest.
**Speaker 3**: Okay, I'm sorry, I missed the first part of the meeting.
**Bclymer**: So basically, we're going to adjust the schedule and show it.
**Steve.fischer**: Basically.
**Bclymer**: How many generators do you want to do, Steve?
**Bclymer**: One or two or.
**Steve.fischer**: Three?
**Jdawson**: I don't know.
**Jdawson**: Let's just say one and then tell me what we think the timeline is for each additional one.
**Steve.fischer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So we're going to adjust everything.
**Bclymer**: We're going to do everything, essentially.
**Bclymer**: But, you know, the generators and transfer switches, we're just going to do one generator, one transfer switch, and then as they gear up or they get more orders or whatever from the government, then we'll add them later, but we'll still do the ceiling H vac and all that.
**Speaker 3**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So, yeah, we're going to.
**Bclymer**: We just got to get schedule and pricing update.
**Speaker 3**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And we might need to do, like, the additional AC units, like, asap.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Because we're already not holding temperature in that room.
**Jdawson**: But I don't know.
**Jdawson**: I think some of it might just be we have someone coming in just to look at the units and, like, just do more maintenance on them and just see, you know, are they not working or whatever.
**Jdawson**: But I don't know.
**Steve.fischer**: I mean.
**Speaker 3**: So do you want it broke apart for, like, all the H vac immediately?
**Jdawson**: I don't think we need to break it apart.
**Jdawson**: Maybe.
**Jdawson**: Maybe like just.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, tell us, like, what the cost is to like, have release you guys on the H vac stuff now.
**Jdawson**: But then, I mean, it's all going.
**Bclymer**: To be pretty much tied together.
**Bclymer**: There's not like a ton of stuff, you know, like we.
**Bclymer**: It's not like if we do.
**Jdawson**: But I just.
**Jdawson**: But it's just like.
**Jdawson**: I mean, it's gonna be.
**Jdawson**: I can just get approval for, you know, $2 million a lot quicker than I can for 7 million.
**Bclymer**: I mean, if that's the case, then what we could do, and we can break this out is just do the units and just.
**Bclymer**: It's because right now we have them ducted down.
**Bclymer**: But we can just hurry up, get the units in and then just leave it open.
**Bclymer**: So they're just blowing straight down and then, you know, come and do the duct and ceiling.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, sure.
**Jdawson**: I guess I don't even necessarily care about cost, but just plan for that as far as what you're actually going to do.
**Bclymer**: Gotcha.
**Jdawson**: That makes sense.
**Bclymer**: Get the ceilings done.
**Bclymer**: Let's get the HVC done as soon as possible.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, let's just for now try and just get approval on the whole amount.
**Bclymer**: And then we'll back down if need be.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I like that.
**Steve.fischer**: Cool.
**Bclymer**: All right, we'll get that stuff adjusted, and we'll get those, you know, comments addressed.
**Jdawson**: Okay, sounds good.
**Speaker 3**: And then you wanted us to resend you these drawings, the new set.
**Jdawson**: I think I have them, so let me.
**Jdawson**: Well, I'm gonna just send them what we have now, but let me send them to you guys and make sure that you feel like they're the latest.
**Steve.fischer**: Okay?
**Speaker 3**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Sounds good.
**Jdawson**: If you guys can just confirm what I'm sharing is the latest set.
**Jdawson**: Maybe I didn't send it to him.
**Jdawson**: Kind of.
**Jdawson**: See, there's a lot of.
**Jdawson**: I think I might have only sent them the stuff that was.
**Jdawson**: Oh, no electrical plans for phase two.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I don't know.
**Jdawson**: I'll send you what I have, and you can let me know.
**Jdawson**: I think.
**Jdawson**: I don't know that I have the mechanicals.
**Bclymer**: Double check it and make sure we got everything.
**Jdawson**: It.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, all I have, Jesse, is this is something from Mid south for the electrical plans, and then the architect mechanical is in here as well.
**Speaker 3**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: This architect is just one page.
**Bclymer**: That's just a life safety plan.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, yeah, we have the ceiling grid drawings here.
**Speaker 3**: We got the mechanical drawings.
**Bclymer**: Structural.
**Speaker 3**: Structural.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: So we'll.
**Bclymer**: We'll compile and send you a link with all of them.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, we've got a civil plan, so.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, we'll get them cleaned up, sent over to you.
**Jdawson**: Okay, cool.
**Bclymer**: Awesome.
**Bclymer**: Well, we'll get all that stuff over to you.
**Jdawson**: Appreciate it.
**Steve.fischer**: Yep.
