## Transcript
**Speaker 0**: Popularity.
**Speaker 0**: Investors have poured $27 billion into generative AI startups and in the next 10 years could raise robo GDP by as much as 7%.
**Speaker 0**: I'm Dan Martell.
**Speaker 0**: I'm a technology entrepreneur.
**Speaker 0**: I've invested with dozen AI companies.
**Speaker 0**: I coach for 50 plus and I've helped many of my friends build AI business models.
**Speaker 0**: And what I wanted to do is to make millions of dollars in AI today.
**Speaker 0**: The founder and creator of SAS Academy.
**Speaker 0**: Over a thousand businesses rely on this to help take their business to another level.
**Speaker 0**: My life today is really about trying to optimize how much can I give.
**Speaker 0**: It's one of those things where I won't take your job, but people using AI will take your job.
**Speaker 0**: Is this a bag or should I get involved?
**Speaker 0**: The answer is it's definitely not a bad.
**Speaker 0**: I've been studying this for close to a decade.
**Speaker 0**: It's a really cool place we're living in where we have a new tool that is providing so much productivity to the team.
**Speaker 0**: I think the most valuable asset is not one of technology, but the creativity reimagine in what's possible.
**Speaker 0**: To me, entrepreneurs who embrace AI today, they will essentially shape the narratives of at home in the room.
**Speaker 0**: Please get to your feet and give a huge, huge welcome to genius in this space.
**Speaker 0**: So excited he's here.
**Speaker 0**: Lift it up for.
**Speaker 0**: Are you guys ready to learn about say AI?
**Speaker 0**: Say yes.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: Cannot do any wrong in this room.
**Speaker 0**: You guys are incredible.
**Speaker 0**: This morning I was looking at my clothes and grabbed some shorts cuz I'm in Florida.
**Speaker 0**: And then I remembered I'm coming here today.
**Speaker 0**: Put the pants on.
**Speaker 0**: This is so fun.
**Speaker 0**: One of the things that I've been most excited about specifically because this is integration day, this is the day we take it all.
**Speaker 0**: Yes.
**Speaker 0**: And we bring it together.
**Speaker 0**: And with AI, I'm going to show you how to do it 3, 4, 5, 10 times faster.
**Speaker 0**: You guys want to learn how to do that?
**Speaker 0**: Say yes.
**Speaker 0**: All right.
**Speaker 0**: Before I get into it, you need to know something very important.
**Speaker 0**: The reason I am here, I'm just gonna hit my slides.
**Speaker 0**: There we go.
**Speaker 0**: Is because I had somebody show up in my life at a time when I didn't believe like I deserved to get to breathe the air I was breathing.
**Speaker 0**: As a teenager, I struggled with addiction and I ended up in jail twice by the time I was 17.
**Speaker 0**: And a guard named Brian sat me down, looked me in the eyes and said to me, you don't belong here.
**Speaker 0**: And I remember when he said those words, I thought to myself that you don't know me.
**Speaker 0**: I'm not like he believed something that I wanted to dismiss.
**Speaker 0**: And for whatever reason I didn't know at the time, I definitely heard today somebody showed up in my life and that that seed got planted.
**Speaker 0**: And a few months later, I got out of that position.
**Speaker 0**: I ended up in a rehab center where I started to do the work.
**Speaker 0**: And you guys know what I mean.
**Speaker 0**: This room gets.
**Speaker 0**: When I say the work all caps.
**Speaker 0**: The work.
**Speaker 0**: I did the work.
**Speaker 0**: 11 months of work.
**Speaker 0**: Okay?
**Speaker 0**: That's shit I had to deal with.
**Speaker 0**: Does that make sense?
**Speaker 0**: Say yes.
**Speaker 0**: And what happened is at the end of this program, beautiful place.
**Speaker 0**: It saved my life, helped me rebuild my relationship with my family and build some confidence.
**Speaker 0**: I was helping Rick the maintenance guy clean out one of the cabins.
**Speaker 0**: It was built on an old church camp.
**Speaker 0**: And as I opened this room, there's a table sitting there with a 486 computer and a yellow book on Java program.
**Speaker 0**: Who knows what a 486 computer.
**Speaker 0**: Show of hands, you're old.
**Speaker 0**: And I opened the book thinking this thing probably is not going to make any sense.
**Speaker 0**: And first page, you know, I look at this Java program and it reads like English.
**Speaker 0**: So I sat there and I just thought, I'll just turn it on all that, you know, get away from doing all this heavy labor type work.
**Speaker 0**: And I just started tapping on the keyboard.
**Speaker 0**: Follow the instructions.
**Speaker 0**: Chapter one on this yellow book on Java program.
**Speaker 0**: And after 20 minutes, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.
**Speaker 0**: I hit enter.
**Speaker 0**: Poof.
**Speaker 0**: And on the screen it says, hello, world.
**Speaker 0**: I know you guys are like, bro, so smart.
**Speaker 0**: Can't wait to learn the AI from this guy.
**Speaker 0**: I know it's not a mobile app.
**Speaker 0**: It did change the world, but it changed my world.
**Speaker 0**: And because of that, I've had the privilege of not only building and exiting several companies, becoming a multimillionaire by the time I was 27.
**Speaker 0**: But my favorite part, the thing I'm most proud of, that I want you to know, is that I continue to share that message with the kids that were once like me.
**Speaker 0**: And when I get the opportunity to come here and share the AI side with you, you need to know that because you might dismiss, like, well, he's just smart.
**Speaker 0**: He knows all this stuff.
**Speaker 0**: He probably went to university and had a computer science degree.
**Speaker 0**: I don't.
**Speaker 0**: I don't have any of that, okay?
**Speaker 0**: Computers and code and technology saved my life.
**Speaker 0**: It provided a life for me that I have the privilege to live.
**Speaker 0**: And it is why I'm so excited to share it all.
**Speaker 0**: With you guys.
**Speaker 0**: You guys want to learn this, say yes.
**Speaker 0**: Ah, here's what I know.
**Speaker 0**: The value of an idea lies in you.
**Speaker 0**: Here.
**Speaker 0**: I'm going to share with you.
**Speaker 0**: Okay?
**Speaker 0**: For those that are just beginning and those that are super advanced, folks that are just starting off in their business or their journey, to folks that have been doing this for 28 years, like myself, I'm going to take everything I've learned.
**Speaker 0**: I've been doing AI for almost a day, decade, way before chat GPT, and I've looked at everything and what's happened in the last four weeks.
**Speaker 0**: I've updated my presentation three times in the last month because of the amount of change.
**Speaker 0**: So I'm going to give you guys the good of what's going to happen.
**Speaker 0**: But I need a commitment from you that you're going to take notes.
**Speaker 0**: Okay?
**Speaker 0**: If you're following along from home, there is.
**Speaker 0**: I want you to write this down.
**Speaker 0**: Okay?
**Speaker 0**: What's the hardest part about AI for you?
**Speaker 0**: Write that down.
**Speaker 0**: Everybody in this room, if you call them from home, we've got in the download area of the portal, you can download the worksheet.
**Speaker 0**: For those in the room, just open up the workbooks, find a blank page, and let's start making some commitments.
**Speaker 0**: Okay?
**Speaker 0**: AI will change your life if you do the work.
**Speaker 0**: If not, it'll just be a thing that you know about that you don't do anything with.
**Speaker 0**: So let me read something I can't remember.
**Speaker 0**: Programming job as a kid.
**Speaker 0**: No, you probably are basic.
**Speaker 0**: Hello, world from home.
**Speaker 0**: I want to hear in the chat, what did you.
**Speaker 0**: What do you find the hardest about AI?
**Speaker 0**: Throw it out.
**Speaker 0**: I want to hear some answers.
**Speaker 0**: What do you guys got?
**Speaker 0**: Knowing how to use it.
**Speaker 0**: What else?
**Speaker 0**: What questions do I ask it?
**Speaker 0**: Perfect.
**Speaker 0**: Anybody else over here.
**Speaker 0**: Too many.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: What tools to use?
**Speaker 0**: 100%.
**Speaker 0**: I am going to make a commitment.
**Speaker 0**: I'm going to answer every one of those questions and then more.
**Speaker 0**: You guys excited to learn this?
**Speaker 0**: There's your workbook.
**Speaker 0**: When you get back to the portal, if you got it on your phone, go download it.
**Speaker 0**: I've gone advanced.
**Speaker 0**: Okay, so in this presentation, we tell some stories to really make it stick.
**Speaker 0**: But in the portal, I've got advanced prompt techniques that I use from some of my AI scientists on my team so that you guys can reference that later.
**Speaker 0**: But for the next hour, we're going to do this together.
**Speaker 0**: So 21 months ago, this is what generative AI video looked like.
**Speaker 0**: I know.
**Speaker 0**: Only.
**Speaker 0**: I'll say it again.
**Speaker 0**: Only 21 months ago, that was the state of the art this is in the last two weeks.
**Speaker 0**: What is up, mommy gang?
**Speaker 0**: It's your founding brother, Chad.
**Speaker 0**: Welcome to call him mommy.
**Speaker 0**: Today we'll be talking about great skincare.
**Speaker 0**: As a man, do you splash water on your face two times or three?
**Speaker 0**: If I am not real, how can I break your heart?
**Speaker 0**: Crazy, I know.
**Speaker 0**: In the week.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, clap that up.
**Speaker 0**: That's wild.
**Speaker 0**: Available to every one of you in this room for free.
**Speaker 0**: That's what's wild.
**Speaker 0**: Generated with a prompt.
**Speaker 0**: This is a big idea.
**Speaker 0**: When people try to understand how impactful AI is going to be, you got to understand from first time in human history, the programming language of the technology is English.
**Speaker 0**: Think about, you don't have to learn JavaScript or Basic or C or any of these deep core technologies.
**Speaker 0**: You can use the words that you know how to speak to generate this.
**Speaker 0**: That's why it's going to have such a magical impact on your life.
**Speaker 0**: A lot of people, though, they get scared of this.
**Speaker 0**: And I was, when I first started kind of seeing that the generative, kind of the marketing side of the video side kind of freaked me out.
**Speaker 0**: But when I look at history, we can kind of look back and say, okay, you know, before when we were thinking about doing our laundry, we had to do it by hand.
**Speaker 0**: Think about how much time that took to sit there with a machine to do all the laundry, to then put it out, to dry it out, to fold it and put it away.
**Speaker 0**: Then we got electricity, right?
**Speaker 0**: And we had these machines that allowed us to do the laundry when we weren't there.
**Speaker 0**: How many of you guys.
**Speaker 0**: I shouldn't say, some of you guys probably love to do laundry.
**Speaker 0**: How many people don't like to do laundry?
**Speaker 0**: Show hands.
**Speaker 0**: That's it.
**Speaker 0**: Exactly.
**Speaker 0**: So are we happy that somebody created electricity in the laundry machine?
**Speaker 0**: Say yes.
**Speaker 0**: Okay, well, let's.
**Speaker 0**: This is the crazy part.
**Speaker 0**: I was in Japan.
**Speaker 0**: I go to our house, they have a laundry machine, and it is one machine, not two.
**Speaker 0**: I'm not used to this.
**Speaker 0**: And I see this machine there and I put the laundry in, I hit the button and I'm like, how does it know what to do?
**Speaker 0**: And it turns out this laundry machine has AI ask me how I know that.
**Speaker 0**: Has AI say how Dave, how Kevin couldn't figure out how to get the laundry out.
**Speaker 0**: First off, my wife was very impressed with the laundry.
**Speaker 0**: And then second of all, I couldn't figure out how to unlock it once it was all done.
**Speaker 0**: So I went on YouTube and that's where I discovered the machine.
**Speaker 0**: I was using had AI built into it to sense as it colors is it lights and what cycles it at and how dry it is and it optimizes it for electricity.
**Speaker 0**: And it is mind blowing.
**Speaker 0**: And that's where we're at today.
**Speaker 0**: See what we've got going on right now is, and it's always been this way, is the tool plus the human equals outcomes.
**Speaker 0**: Steve Jobs said, I created the personal computer because I consider it the bicycle, the brain.
**Speaker 0**: Now we have a new tool that's available to all of you that is going to change your life.
**Speaker 0**: My dad, this man we call his Fit Vic is what we call him.
**Speaker 0**: His name is Victor.
**Speaker 0**: 32 months ago, that's how long ago ChatGPT came out.
**Speaker 0**: 32 months ago.
**Speaker 0**: Some of you guys feel like it's longer.
**Speaker 0**: It's not.
**Speaker 0**: I'm hosting an event.
**Speaker 0**: My dad's in the back of the room just like this and he's watching my team train up everybody in my life on how AI is going to transform everything.
**Speaker 0**: So he's sitting in the back, he's watching my buddy Matt on stage doing a dev on Chat GPT at the time.
**Speaker 0**: And he turns over me, he goes, hey D, what is that?
**Speaker 0**: Said, dude, that's AI.
**Speaker 0**: How does it work?
**Speaker 0**: He said, oh, I'll just show you.
**Speaker 0**: So I asked Josh to see next.
**Speaker 0**: I say Josh to cover my dad use them like so my dad, who's 63 sits there.
**Speaker 0**: Josh goes, well, I don't know Mr. Martell, what do you, what do you got in your life going on?
**Speaker 0**: How you know?
**Speaker 0**: He's like, I don't know.
**Speaker 0**: I do, I got a couple real estate properties.
**Speaker 0**: And he goes, oh well, let's create a.
**Speaker 0**: You need a lease agreement.
**Speaker 0**: He's like, usually I call the lawyer.
**Speaker 0**: Are you paying for the lawyer?
**Speaker 0**: He goes, yeah, check this out, Josh as a prompt to tell me about the location and you know, the tenant and the, the state you're in and all that stuff.
**Speaker 0**: And then he hits enter it prints out a perfectly worded lease agreement.
**Speaker 0**: My dad looks at me and goes, Dan, how much is that?
**Speaker 0**: He said, dad, it's great.
**Speaker 0**: Dad immediately became the AI expert in his old folks community.
**Speaker 0**: He lives in Florida.
**Speaker 0**: He's the guy AI guy amongst his friends.
**Speaker 0**: It is so approachable to Altium guys.
**Speaker 0**: Okay, so I just want you to understand this is gonna feel like, I don't know, technology is hard.
**Speaker 0**: Some of you guys are using it today.
**Speaker 0**: But it is a big opportunity.
**Speaker 0**: So here's the question.
**Speaker 0**: If you can look at your Life.
**Speaker 0**: And I want you to like really broad spots, right?
**Speaker 0**: Personal, professional.
**Speaker 0**: What do you want AI to do for you?
**Speaker 0**: I would encourage you to consider the stuff that's sucks your energy, that doesn't make you any money.
**Speaker 0**: Make that list three things.
**Speaker 0**: I want you to write them down.
**Speaker 0**: What would you love?
**Speaker 0**: AI Dream big.
**Speaker 0**: Anything is possible.
**Speaker 0**: Don't hold back at home.
**Speaker 0**: I want to hear it in the chat.
**Speaker 0**: Looking at the chats.
**Speaker 0**: Let's go, zoomies.
**Speaker 0**: All right, let me give you a couple examples.
**Speaker 0**: You guys ready for this?
**Speaker 0**: Say yes.
**Speaker 0**: All right.
**Speaker 0**: My buddy Matt's got a gym.
**Speaker 0**: My buddy Matt loves to train people.
**Speaker 0**: You know what he doesn't like to do?
**Speaker 0**: Answer the phone.
**Speaker 0**: So a couple.
**Speaker 0**: I mean, it was almost a year ago now he calls me out and he's like, hey, bro, you're doing the AI stuff I heard about voice stuff.
**Speaker 0**: Can you help me out?
**Speaker 0**: So what are you trying to do?
**Speaker 0**: I'm just sick of answering the phone trying to do stuff that I just assume I don't have to do anymore.
**Speaker 0**: So I connect him to a platform called YourAtlas.com.
**Speaker 0**: okay.
**Speaker 0**: And you can do the demo.
**Speaker 0**: Many of you guys want you just literally on the homepage.
**Speaker 0**: You can do the demo to see what I showed him.
**Speaker 0**: And we just wired it up.
**Speaker 0**: Your Atlas.com takes all the inbound calls.
**Speaker 0**: So when you think that everybody, because you might live in a bubble, you think everybody's using AI.
**Speaker 0**: Here's proof they're not.
**Speaker 0**: Go into your local, you know, Google, search, H vac, plumbers, gyms in your local city.
**Speaker 0**: Call the phone numbers.
**Speaker 0**: If somebody personally answers or you get a directory, I'm telling you, they don't get it.
**Speaker 0**: Because as soon as I showed Matt what your Atlas.com could do, all of a sudden he wires it up.
**Speaker 0**: It essentially is a human grade level AI that answers the phone, has full access to the knowledge base, can answer every question.
**Speaker 0**: And his favorite part sets them up for sales appointments.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, better.
**Speaker 0**: Check this out.
**Speaker 0**: Better than Matt was doing, better than his front desk person could do 24 hours a day, magically.
**Speaker 0**: Okay.
**Speaker 0**: It's not just text, it's voice.
**Speaker 0**: Okay?
**Speaker 0**: The other one is my buddy Matt.
**Speaker 0**: He has a company called Lomi.
**Speaker 0**: Okay?
**Speaker 0**: They're a food composter, but essentially they can take a bio, essentially a biopolymer product like plastics, but it's the special product and it can turn it into dirt.
**Speaker 0**: And they're using AI in the hardware to do what's called Smart Cycle.
**Speaker 0**: Smart cycling allows this machine to take plastic and turn it into a dirt that you take out of the machine and you put it into your plant.
**Speaker 0**: Now, it's a biopolymer plastic, but that is the level of sophistication and impact.
**Speaker 0**: So I don't care if you have a local service business or you've got a hardware company, AI is going to change the way you build your business.
**Speaker 0**: Does that make sense?
**Speaker 0**: Say yes.
**Speaker 0**: Very cool.
**Speaker 0**: This is the big one.
**Speaker 0**: You heard in my present in the opening video, AI isn't going to take your job, but somebody using AI will.
**Speaker 0**: I'm going to give you guys the magic formula.
**Speaker 0**: You guys want to learn the magic formula for AI?
**Speaker 0**: Say yes.
**Speaker 0**: Change whatever business you're in to AI first insert your business industry.
**Speaker 0**: That's where we have to go.
**Speaker 0**: You have to get to a place where you're not a coach.
**Speaker 0**: You're an AI first coach.
**Speaker 0**: You're not H Vac company.
**Speaker 0**: You're an AI First H Vac company.
**Speaker 0**: My buddy Nick, we were just in Seattle.
**Speaker 0**: He had the same conversation that I want to have with you guys today in the city.
**Speaker 0**: And he says, hey, man, I have a sign company.
**Speaker 0**: How should I be thinking about this?
**Speaker 0**: Hey, bro, just flip it.
**Speaker 0**: You're an AI first sign company.
**Speaker 0**: As soon as I said that, he goes, oh, I get it now.
**Speaker 0**: See, if I was an AI first sign company, I'd start looking at all the inputs from my customer.
**Speaker 0**: And how can I add AI to that?
**Speaker 0**: If I looked at how I organized my crew, I would look at AI and how I could make that more efficient.
**Speaker 0**: When I look at getting my maintenance teams out to all the different signs, I could use AI to help with routing.
**Speaker 0**: I said, exactly.
**Speaker 0**: You know what he says to me?
**Speaker 0**: What about my people?
**Speaker 0**: They're going to have to be retrained.
**Speaker 0**: I said, yep.
**Speaker 0**: Think about it.
**Speaker 0**: Cool plus human is the formula going forward.
**Speaker 0**: Does this make sense?
**Speaker 0**: Say yes.
**Speaker 0**: All right, everybody open up a blank piece of paper.
**Speaker 0**: I want to draw something here.
**Speaker 0**: This is all going to make the.
**Speaker 0**: I need to understand.
**Speaker 0**: I want you to understand where you're at in this journey.
**Speaker 0**: Okay?
**Speaker 0**: So this is called the AI Adoption Lab.
**Speaker 0**: @ the first level, this is where most people are at.
**Speaker 0**: But like I said, some people have just decided to opt out of this.
**Speaker 0**: I want to pull you back into it.
**Speaker 0**: This is what I call the play level.
**Speaker 0**: Just gonna change my color on my pen.
**Speaker 0**: Let me still play.
**Speaker 0**: Okay, so that's play, and this is chat.
**Speaker 0**: Okay?
**Speaker 0**: When I look at the function of focus and the frequency, most people are still playing.
**Speaker 0**: And they might be doing this weekly.
**Speaker 0**: When ChatGPT came out.
**Speaker 0**: I understand a simple premise, Okay?
**Speaker 0**: I have two young boys, actually, today, I became the father of a teenager.
**Speaker 0**: Isn't that crazy?
**Speaker 0**: I know.
**Speaker 0**: He's 13.
**Speaker 0**: Today's his birthday.
**Speaker 0**: I'm flying home to go have dinner with them.
**Speaker 0**: And when GPT came out 32 months ago, I realized as a parent that every kid is homeschooled.
**Speaker 0**: It's whether the parents realize it or not.
**Speaker 0**: So parents in the room, listen to this.
**Speaker 0**: As soon as it came out, I realized school's probably not going to teach this for a while.
**Speaker 0**: So every night when I would put them to bed, I pull up my phone.
**Speaker 0**: Don't tell my wife.
**Speaker 0**: He's mad when I do that.
**Speaker 0**: And we would chat with ChatGPT and ask it to write stories, and then we would copy and paste those stories and go to midjourney, which is a generative photo app, and we would generate the visuals for the stories.
**Speaker 0**: But we were playing.
**Speaker 0**: But even in playing, I start to get to use it.
**Speaker 0**: So if you're not using it for fun, asking questions, hey, tell me some 10 fun facts about the city I'm visiting or 10 fun facts about this thing I'm doing.
**Speaker 0**: Like, you can use it to play.
**Speaker 0**: That's level one, okay?
**Speaker 0**: Some of you guys are just there.
**Speaker 0**: You may not even have chat GV account.
**Speaker 0**: You want to start there.
**Speaker 0**: Level two is process, okay?
**Speaker 0**: You have a business, and we have process.
**Speaker 0**: You know how we do process?
**Speaker 0**: It's called a system.
**Speaker 0**: System.
**Speaker 0**: And a system stands for.
**Speaker 0**: You're gonna love this.
**Speaker 0**: Save yourself time, energy, and money.
**Speaker 0**: Write that one down.
**Speaker 0**: That's a writer down.
**Speaker 0**: Because if you document the system and you give it to somebody, they can follow the process, get the outcome a hundred times every time.
**Speaker 0**: But most people are still only doing it on a daily basis, right?
**Speaker 0**: And that's just the process.
**Speaker 0**: If you think of, like, you know, your.
**Speaker 0**: The.
**Speaker 0**: The different functions in your departments, they should have documented systems.
**Speaker 0**: The cool part is there's AI powered tools.
**Speaker 0**: Remember I said AI power?
**Speaker 0**: There's AI Power tools.
**Speaker 0**: You can't see this.
**Speaker 0**: Oh, you put that up again.
**Speaker 0**: Thanks, team.
**Speaker 0**: All right, Do I have to stay next to it, or can we put that wrong marker?
**Speaker 0**: Use AI.
**Speaker 0**: All right.
**Speaker 0**: All right.
**Speaker 0**: I'm gonna try to word out.
**Speaker 0**: You guys.
**Speaker 0**: You guys get that, though?
**Speaker 0**: That's Chad Play weekly.
**Speaker 0**: Yes.
**Speaker 0**: System, process daily.
**Speaker 0**: New color.
**Speaker 0**: You guys ready for this?
**Speaker 0**: But right here, I just want you to know that there's a tool called trainual.com AI powered systems playbooks, also known as SOPS.
**Speaker 0**: Trainful.
**Speaker 0**: T R A I-N-U-A-L.com.
**Speaker 0**: here's why I love training.
**Speaker 0**: I don't like to type stuff.
**Speaker 0**: I like to talk.
**Speaker 0**: I'm a talker, not a type trainer.
**Speaker 0**: Thank you.
**Speaker 0**: Where are my talkers at?
**Speaker 0**: Make some noise.
**Speaker 0**: Zero surprise.
**Speaker 0**: Okay?
**Speaker 0**: And what you get to do is you can talk through how you do your work or even record what you're doing and give it to Trainual.
**Speaker 0**: And it'll use AI and it'll generate it.
**Speaker 0**: Check this out.
**Speaker 0**: Not only does it generate the whole process for you, the sop, it then went through, assign it to somebody, ask you what frequency you want them to do that on, and then has a checklist that they follow on that frequency so that every day or every week they have to fill it out, but they've got the training from the process that you gave them.
**Speaker 0**: Isn't that freaking awesome?
**Speaker 0**: Say yes.
**Speaker 0**: That's level two.
**Speaker 0**: We're just at level two.
**Speaker 0**: We've got some fun stuff to do.
**Speaker 0**: Level three, this is where we get into the product side product.
**Speaker 0**: And for me, the product is all about the tools that we use.
**Speaker 0**: And this is hourly.
**Speaker 0**: My request of my team 18 months ago, because I live in this AI space, I have a venture studio called Martell Ventures and we build and launch new AI companies almost every month.
**Speaker 0**: So I'm in it thick, but I'm involved in a lot of businesses.
**Speaker 0**: And I went to my different teams about 18 months ago, two years ago, and I said, hey, I need you guys to go find the AI power tools for your department apartments.
**Speaker 0**: And you have to use it every day.
**Speaker 0**: There's no more debate.
**Speaker 0**: This isn't, is it gonna stick around?
**Speaker 0**: Is it gonna get good enough?
**Speaker 0**: It's coming.
**Speaker 0**: We either adopt or we get taken out.
**Speaker 0**: I remember the finance guy comes to me, he goes, hey, Dan, I love that you want us to do this, but financials is pretty straightforward.
**Speaker 0**: Like you look at bank accounts, reconcile stuff.
**Speaker 0**: You have accounts payable, accounts receivable, there's a ports, we pay taxes.
**Speaker 0**: Easy peasy.
**Speaker 0**: And I was thinking, because I know AI, if anybody's going to have their whole world disrupted, it's finance.
**Speaker 0**: And I said, hey, I would encourage you to go out to the world as AI or Google search.
**Speaker 0**: What are the tools?
**Speaker 0**: I said, I'll give you a couple days, I'm going to come back, I want to hear what you find.
**Speaker 0**: Well, I'll tell you when I found them, you know, a few days later, big smile.
**Speaker 0**: I said, what did you find?
**Speaker 0**: Oh, my gosh, Dan.
**Speaker 0**: We found this tool to automate accounts payable.
**Speaker 0**: We found a tool that takes care of all of the fraud detection.
**Speaker 0**: And I was like, tell me about it.
**Speaker 0**: So one of them was called Sift S Y F T. So if you use Xero or any other online accounting, cloud accounting, it plugs in.
**Speaker 0**: What's cool about this technology today is that it does the stuff you do as a CEO.
**Speaker 0**: When you scan a list of transactions, you look for things that look a little weird.
**Speaker 0**: It does that for you.
**Speaker 0**: It notifies you.
**Speaker 0**: It can tell you cash forecasting.
**Speaker 0**: Hey, normally at this time of the month, you would have only spent so much money.
**Speaker 0**: You're a little ahead of that.
**Speaker 0**: Do you have enough cash in other places to cover that potential downfall?
**Speaker 0**: So, like all of the functions in your company need an AI powered tool to run them, period.
**Speaker 0**: Full stop.
**Speaker 0**: Are you guys down to do that?
**Speaker 0**: Say yes.
**Speaker 0**: Let's go.
**Speaker 0**: Next level up is all about the protocol pro toe call the protocol getting a little more advanced.
**Speaker 0**: For some of you that are further with AI, this is about APIs.
**Speaker 0**: And yeah, my nerds in the room where you at.
**Speaker 0**: API stands for application program interface, which is essentially a fancy way of saying, what language do you speak?
**Speaker 0**: If I speak it, I can talk to you.
**Speaker 0**: Okay.
**Speaker 0**: I also, for fun, because I'm a mindset guy as well, I like to use this when I'm having a bad day.
**Speaker 0**: And I call it assume positive intent.
**Speaker 0**: Somebody cuts me off in traffic API, somebody quits API.
**Speaker 0**: Like, it's really hard to have a bad day if you're API in every scenario.
**Speaker 0**: Does that make sense?
**Speaker 0**: Say yes.
**Speaker 0**: Okay.
**Speaker 0**: But as it pertains to software, this is where you start using it by the minute, right?
**Speaker 0**: And what happens is like, so you know, I have a friend, he built this technology that essentially, if you have hundreds of conversations a day or not, even if you even have a dozen plus every day, it gets really hard to manage.
**Speaker 0**: So this product called getrevio.com, okay, Revio, is a product get revolution.
**Speaker 0**: And essentially what it does is it uses AI to help you have those conversations.
**Speaker 0**: What does it do?
**Speaker 0**: Well, using the APIs and the protocols, it lets you get a summary of the conversation with the person.
**Speaker 0**: It lets you, it looks at the chat, it scores your sales conversation.
**Speaker 0**: Are you at a 30% efficiency?
**Speaker 0**: Are you to 70?
**Speaker 0**: It allows you to take junior people, have them operate at a high level.
**Speaker 0**: My favorite part, when he showed me this, I was like, bro, it gives you recommended chats so like remember I talked about copilot Human plus tool wins Revio in a sales chat context allows you to be a better closer because it'll analyze everything you've said about this person, what they've told you so far and actually recommend to or three different chats to send to move the sales conversation for you all powered by the APIs and AI.
**Speaker 0**: Isn't that cool saying yes.
**Speaker 0**: All right, next level.
**Speaker 0**: There's another level.
**Speaker 0**: You guys ready for this?
**Speaker 0**: All right, it's pioneer.
**Speaker 0**: Write that down.
**Speaker 0**: Pioneer level.
**Speaker 0**: And this is custom.
**Speaker 0**: This is where I spend most of my day.
**Speaker 0**: And this is on custom is understanding that the language models that are out there.
**Speaker 0**: Most of you guys, when I say AI, you think chat GPT.
**Speaker 0**: That's cool.
**Speaker 0**: Start there.
**Speaker 0**: But there's other ones.
**Speaker 0**: Claude, Gemini, etc, there's a website, write it down.
**Speaker 0**: It's called Hugging Face.
**Speaker 0**: Like a hug, Hugging face.
**Speaker 0**: I spend most of my time on Hugging Face.
**Speaker 0**: It will make no sense to you unless you're technical in the room where you're looking to pioneer your own AI.
**Speaker 0**: But let me tell you about this.
**Speaker 0**: My buddy Matt has a company called Precision Co. We talk about on and pioneering.
**Speaker 0**: Think about like how if AI is so powerful, how could it help me in my business?
**Speaker 0**: Well, that lets me question Matt had.
**Speaker 0**: So Matt being the technical guy, he is using the existing frameworks on Hugging Face, built his own AI.
**Speaker 0**: What does it do?
**Speaker 0**: Well, you come into the platform, you connect all your computer systems, your CRM, your financial systems, your accounting.
**Speaker 0**: That's all you got to give it.
**Speaker 0**: And it uses AI to analyze your business.
**Speaker 0**: Well, how does it know your business?
**Speaker 0**: It looks at your transactions, it looks at your accounting, it looks at your CRM, it knows who your customers are.
**Speaker 0**: And then once it knows that which is instant because it's always on and it's monitoring, it then tells you this is going to blow your mind.
**Speaker 0**: Hey, this is like we're talking.
**Speaker 0**: You guys came from Business Mastery.
**Speaker 0**: For the latest and greatest.
**Speaker 0**: Say yes, I'm going to give it to you.
**Speaker 0**: It'll give you the three core metrics, the numbers you need to monitor for all the key areas of your business.
**Speaker 0**: Automatically, it's going to analyze your performance based on the industry norms, tell you if you're red, green or yellow.
**Speaker 0**: Very sophisticated traffic light system.
**Speaker 0**: You guys can all do this.
**Speaker 0**: And here's my favorite part.
**Speaker 0**: It then tells you what are the key projects you should work on to fix the color, to turn it from red to yellow, yellow to green.
**Speaker 0**: Then gives you the agenda for your meeting you should be having with your team every week.
**Speaker 0**: Isn't that crazy?
**Speaker 0**: Let's hear it.
**Speaker 0**: His company is going to be worth $100 billion in the next 12 months.
**Speaker 0**: The reason I share that story with you is because he's no different than any one of you.
**Speaker 0**: His background is operations.
**Speaker 0**: He found a technical partner, Precision Co. You can just search Precision AI and you'll probably find it.
**Speaker 0**: But that's why I'm excited about this is no matter where you're at, there's massive opportunities in this room.
**Speaker 0**: So I want everybody at home to post your answer in the chat.
**Speaker 0**: In this room.
**Speaker 0**: Write it down.
**Speaker 0**: Are you at the play level weekly?
**Speaker 0**: Are you at process and systems daily?
**Speaker 0**: Are you pro product protocol or are you a pioneer?
**Speaker 0**: Write it in the chat.
**Speaker 0**: Everybody in your notebooks and go, where are you at?
**Speaker 0**: Got to play some process, some systems.
**Speaker 0**: Here's what I want.
**Speaker 0**: I want everybody to pay attention.
**Speaker 0**: You guys, you guys focus on me for a second.
**Speaker 0**: I want you to understand, I'm gonna give you like how many know what the Care Bear is?
**Speaker 0**: A Care Bear.
**Speaker 0**: You guys old enough to know care.
**Speaker 0**: I'm giving you the Care Bear AI love.
**Speaker 0**: It's coming from a belly.
**Speaker 0**: It's going right to you.
**Speaker 0**: Because I want you guys to feel that this is available to every one of you.
**Speaker 0**: Don't think like, I'm not the technical person.
**Speaker 0**: I can't do this.
**Speaker 0**: I want you to feel my excitement with that.
**Speaker 0**: I want you guys to make some noise.
**Speaker 0**: Let's go.
**Speaker 0**: It need to show you how to do this now.
**Speaker 0**: I told you where you're at.
**Speaker 0**: Now we're going to talk about how to do this.
**Speaker 0**: Okay?
**Speaker 0**: So big idea.
**Speaker 0**: Everybody on your team, you can share this with them.
**Speaker 0**: Disrupt your self.
**Speaker 0**: Descri future.
**Speaker 0**: Disrupt your self.
**Speaker 0**: Prosper your future.
**Speaker 0**: If you have slack, you should write this in your slack in your general channel right now.
**Speaker 0**: Like, tell your team, disrupt yourself care in the future because they're just as scared as you are.
**Speaker 0**: Disrupt yourself.
**Speaker 0**: Secure your future.
**Speaker 0**: Three hot principles to make AI adoption and integration simple and flawless.
**Speaker 0**: Number one, you gotta learn how to speak it.
**Speaker 0**: Like I mentioned, AI is the first technology in the history of mankind that if you program it, it's English.
**Speaker 0**: So that's exciting and also means everybody in the world can do it.
**Speaker 0**: There's no barrier.
**Speaker 0**: That's.
**Speaker 0**: So what I recommend always is to do a thing called habit stacking.
**Speaker 0**: So a habit stack is essentially finding something you do every day today and add using AI to it.
**Speaker 0**: So two and a half Years ago, when I was like, okay, I need to make AI by default.
**Speaker 0**: I realize that every morning when I wake up, I go read in the same chair.
**Speaker 0**: I'm assuming you guys are into morning routines and rhythms and rituals.
**Speaker 0**: Say yes.
**Speaker 0**: Okay, then just here's what you do.
**Speaker 0**: When you go sit in the chair, I want you to pull out whatever AI you use.
**Speaker 0**: And if you don't know which one, start with Chat GPT.
**Speaker 0**: It's free.
**Speaker 0**: It's one of the most powerful language models out there today, and I will challenge you to ask it three questions.
**Speaker 0**: Anything.
**Speaker 0**: Some people go, what do I ask it?
**Speaker 0**: Guess what a great first question would be.
**Speaker 0**: I know this is the wildest technology that exists, that the.
**Speaker 0**: The way you use it, it gets better.
**Speaker 0**: Like, it's kind of crazy to wrap your head around this.
**Speaker 0**: See, I believe that all the problems are no longer problems.
**Speaker 0**: Every problem in your life is no longer a problem.
**Speaker 0**: If you learn how AI works, they're solved.
**Speaker 0**: Then it's a question of what are you pretending not to know?
**Speaker 0**: I know I'm trying not to punch too hard, but sometimes you've got to be direct.
**Speaker 0**: All your problems are no longer problems.
**Speaker 0**: So then the problem to answer is, what do I do first?
**Speaker 0**: This is what you do first.
**Speaker 0**: You integrate it into your life.
**Speaker 0**: I do not go into a meeting, a presentation like this, get on a call, deal with a strategic decision without first going to AI Because I'm not going to pretend that I'm smarter than the world's combined knowledge synthesized and distilled into the specific application.
**Speaker 0**: Understanding my world and what I want to get done, I'm not that smart.
**Speaker 0**: And me plus AI and building this habit stack has changed my life.
**Speaker 0**: You guys want that?
**Speaker 0**: Say yes.
**Speaker 0**: That's what we got to do.
**Speaker 0**: To do that, you got to understand how to talk to it.
**Speaker 0**: It's called prompt protocol.
**Speaker 0**: Okay?
**Speaker 0**: And, you know, I remember about a year and a half ago, I was.
**Speaker 0**: I was flying around, I sat next to this lawyer.
**Speaker 0**: And, you know, that was still in the days where people were still debating if AI was going to disrupt their jobs.
**Speaker 0**: And I remember talking to them.
**Speaker 0**: They were a commercial real estate lawyer in New York.
**Speaker 0**: And, you know, she was like, yeah.
**Speaker 0**: And I'm like, okay, show me.
**Speaker 0**: And she's like, well, not that much, but I use it sometimes.
**Speaker 0**: I said, well.
**Speaker 0**: And I was.
**Speaker 0**: I had my laptop open, I was doing some work.
**Speaker 0**: I said, why don't we play around with it?
**Speaker 0**: And I literally asked them to tell me about her situation.
**Speaker 0**: I asked her, I said, tell me about it.
**Speaker 0**: We put it in and I hit the enter button because I understand how to talk to it.
**Speaker 0**: And when I hit enter and it outputted, the whole.
**Speaker 0**: Her whole job was right there.
**Speaker 0**: She looked at me with her eyes wide open.
**Speaker 0**: She's like, oh, gosh, it did a better job than I would have done.
**Speaker 0**: It added a closet.
**Speaker 0**: She forgot about adding that.
**Speaker 0**: Nobody asked her to it.
**Speaker 0**: She's like.
**Speaker 0**: When she saw it, she goes, oh, my gosh, it's so smart.
**Speaker 0**: If you don't know how to talk to it, then it becomes really hard.
**Speaker 0**: So in the download that I gave all of you, it's in the portal.
**Speaker 0**: There's these four steps to prompting, okay?
**Speaker 0**: And I put it in there so that you can learn how to talk to it.
**Speaker 0**: Have you ever used AI and you hope it can do something, but it only does like 30%, right?
**Speaker 0**: It's like.
**Speaker 0**: It kind of does it, but it's not really good.
**Speaker 0**: What you're missing is the four steps.
**Speaker 0**: Once you understand the four steps, it'll change everything.
**Speaker 0**: Cool.
**Speaker 0**: Here's the big idea.
**Speaker 0**: Innovation comes from good habits, not random actions.
**Speaker 0**: If you think of all your progress you've ever gotten in your life, if you consider that innovation, it only came from creating new habits that you showed up.
**Speaker 0**: You integrated your identity, not from random trying and playing and dabbling.
**Speaker 0**: No more dabbling.
**Speaker 0**: Okay?
**Speaker 0**: I want to hear.
**Speaker 0**: You guys ready to.
**Speaker 0**: No more dabbling.
**Speaker 0**: Say yes.
**Speaker 0**: No more dabbling.
**Speaker 0**: We're going to learn how to prompt.
**Speaker 0**: Where could your trigger for AI habit start?
**Speaker 0**: I want you to write down where in your life.
**Speaker 0**: It could be late at night, it could be first thing in the morning.
**Speaker 0**: If I need you at least to make it commitment and write down where it starts.
**Speaker 0**: For me, it's in my reading chair.
**Speaker 0**: I always do three prompts.
**Speaker 0**: I play around, man.
**Speaker 0**: I've had some wild chats with AI first thing in the morning.
**Speaker 0**: Wild.
**Speaker 0**: Here's what the prompt protocol looks like.
**Speaker 0**: Again, I don't want to overwhelm you.
**Speaker 0**: Once you get, you get.
**Speaker 0**: Everybody's got access to the downloads, so you don't need to take a picture of it.
**Speaker 0**: It's my gift to you.
**Speaker 0**: Now, again, I wanted to give you guys the best of the best.
**Speaker 0**: I just updated this GPT5 came out last week.
**Speaker 0**: Okay.
**Speaker 0**: This is the new standard from the president of Open AI Tony Ashley Dan.
**Speaker 0**: Always bring my group the best.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, And I wanted to update everything so you guys get the best of the best of the best.
**Speaker 0**: And in the download, not only do I give you the protocol, like the prompting structure.
**Speaker 0**: I also give you examples per department in your business, all for you.
**Speaker 0**: Isn't that exciting?
**Speaker 0**: Let's hear it.
**Speaker 0**: All right, let's go.
**Speaker 0**: Let's go.
**Speaker 0**: The energy is contagious.
**Speaker 0**: I love it.
**Speaker 0**: Now, I'm gonna just give you a little tip.
**Speaker 0**: You guys want a tip?
**Speaker 0**: Say yes.
**Speaker 0**: If you ever do a prompt and you're, like, chatting with it, and it gives you an outcome, and you're chatting with it, and it gives you an outcome, and then you're like, ooh, I like the way it answers that.
**Speaker 0**: Here's the trick.
**Speaker 0**: Ask it to write the prompt.
**Speaker 0**: That would have got you that.
**Speaker 0**: I know it's an advanced move, but asking the AI to write the prompt once it's got a format or an output you like, that's how I've created all my advanced prompts.
**Speaker 0**: Here's a big idea.
**Speaker 0**: Okay?
**Speaker 0**: This is business mastery.
**Speaker 0**: So I want to give you masterful.
**Speaker 0**: Your props are the new intellectual property of your business.
**Speaker 0**: Some of you get this.
**Speaker 0**: Some of you guys are starting off so you don't understand how powerful that is.
**Speaker 0**: When you go to sell your company, you're going to get value based on the intellectual property of the business.
**Speaker 0**: Today, when I buy software companies, a lot of them have been built on top of these language models, AI.
**Speaker 0**: And what's valuable to me is not the software.
**Speaker 0**: It's the prompts they use to generate the outputs.
**Speaker 0**: That's the intellectual property.
**Speaker 0**: So again, doesn't matter if you have a plumbing company or a transportation company.
**Speaker 0**: Your prompts that you use to do your work is what becomes valuable.
**Speaker 0**: Okay, big idea.
**Speaker 0**: Here's my favorite part, though.
**Speaker 0**: This is why you got to bring this back to your teams, is in learning, you will teach, and it teaches you a lot of.
**Speaker 0**: When I made it a weekly rhythm every Monday, we call it leadership training for me to teach my teams to scale them up.
**Speaker 0**: At first I was like, I don't really want to teach.
**Speaker 0**: But I knew that if I wanted to continue to be advanced, on the cutting edge of AI, how to do this, everything changed in my life.
**Speaker 0**: So I really want to encourage you, take what you learned today, bring it back to your teams, and really force yourself to try to teach them.
**Speaker 0**: And in teaching, you will learn deeper.
**Speaker 0**: Can you do that?
**Speaker 0**: Say yes.
**Speaker 0**: Awesome.
**Speaker 0**: Hot.
**Speaker 0**: Principle number.
**Speaker 0**: Got to integrate the AI.
**Speaker 0**: Okay, there's one thing.
**Speaker 0**: To use it for prompts and learn how to speak it.
**Speaker 0**: Now we got to go to step two.
**Speaker 0**: We got to integrate it into our functions to our work.
**Speaker 0**: So for me, I remember.
**Speaker 0**: So I have this.
**Speaker 0**: I have two parts of my life.
**Speaker 0**: I have Martel Media and which is my, essentially my social media, my distribution, which is wild.
**Speaker 0**: How many of you guys follow me on social media?
**Speaker 0**: Show hands.
**Speaker 0**: It's only three years old.
**Speaker 0**: Isn't that crazy?
**Speaker 0**: Last month we had 200 million people view my content.
**Speaker 0**: I'm like, I don't.
**Speaker 0**: Thank you.
**Speaker 0**: I don't even understand how.
**Speaker 0**: Yes, thank you.
**Speaker 0**: But I will tell you, all I did was start the media company and use what I'm going to teach you to unblock my team.
**Speaker 0**: Does that make sense?
**Speaker 0**: You guys want to learn how to unblock your team?
**Speaker 0**: Say yes.
**Speaker 0**: So for example, when we started recording everything.
**Speaker 0**: So fun fact.
**Speaker 0**: I don't approve anything that goes out on social.
**Speaker 0**: I know I could hear you like, thank you.
**Speaker 0**: Because I don't want to.
**Speaker 0**: I'm who I am.
**Speaker 0**: I know what I said.
**Speaker 0**: I said it.
**Speaker 0**: And if the team thinks it's valuable to people, hit publish.
**Speaker 0**: I get to see when you get to see it.
**Speaker 0**: So we capture everything.
**Speaker 0**: We have 70 terabytes of video data and the team, somebody poor souls have to go through it all and try to figure out what's valuable.
**Speaker 0**: And I watched them do it.
**Speaker 0**: And when I had that meeting 18 months ago with the teams and said, hey, I really need you guys to like challenge yourself to go find AI powered tools to do your job, they came back and found a tool that saved them literally 70% of their time by scanning all the videos and pulling out the clips.
**Speaker 0**: And it's, it's available to all of them.
**Speaker 0**: And that's just one example.
**Speaker 0**: So the tool is called Opus, I think is what they use.
**Speaker 0**: But there's also Munch AI or Vizard AI.
**Speaker 0**: I know some of you guys are like, what's the tool?
**Speaker 0**: Can I give you guys a tip?
**Speaker 0**: You guys want a tip?
**Speaker 0**: Say yes.
**Speaker 0**: Yes.
**Speaker 0**: Every time you have a question about the right tool, go back to the ar.
**Speaker 0**: I know habit stacking.
**Speaker 0**: We got to develop the habit to use the AI because I'm telling you that's what works today.
**Speaker 0**: Somebody can build something better in three months.
**Speaker 0**: And I would hate for you to be like, oh, I'm using Opus Clip when Opus is on the bottom of the list and there's a better one at the top.
**Speaker 0**: So always go back to AI to ask it the tools like in sales.
**Speaker 0**: Do you know there's like tools in sales that you can plug in all the calls and it automatically analyzes your whole sales calls.
**Speaker 0**: Your sales team tells you who's performing, who's not, tells you real time.
**Speaker 0**: If they're on a call and the prospect says something, exactly what to reply because it analyzes your best salespeople's phone calls.
**Speaker 0**: When the other people said this, that salesperson said this.
**Speaker 0**: So it tells the people that just started off exactly what to say in response.
**Speaker 0**: I'm telling you it is wildly productive.
**Speaker 0**: So you have to get the tools integrated into the business.
**Speaker 0**: Another one, Dave, we talked about Pioneer.
**Speaker 0**: This one is near and dear to my heart because I helped build.
**Speaker 0**: Remember I said we have 70 terabytes of data?
**Speaker 0**: Well, one of the big pieces of work that my media team has to do is go through all that to find B roll.
**Speaker 0**: So B roll is what shows up when I say words and then they put it up.
**Speaker 0**: And you know, you would think if you've ever used your iPhone and you search in the photos app, you can like, if you didn't notice, you can search like red fire hydrant, it'll find every photo.
**Speaker 0**: But there was nothing powerful enough to do that level of search on video.
**Speaker 0**: So I grabbed one of my data scientists named James and I said, this is my challenge.
**Speaker 0**: Figure out a way to index, scan and use AI to go through 70 terabytes of video so that my media team can search a term and find a 15 second video clip to insert in the video.
**Speaker 0**: Because they were spending 30.
**Speaker 0**: How many?
**Speaker 0**: 30 hours a week doing this.
**Speaker 0**: It took us a few months and we built a tool called Turbo B Roll.
**Speaker 0**: It's not available to any of you.
**Speaker 0**: I apologize if you guys are all excited, but this is what I'm trying to say is you have to integrate it into your businesses.
**Speaker 0**: Two months of development time might have cost me 30, 40 grand, but it's going to save all my editors 30 hours a week.
**Speaker 0**: This is the opportunity to some of you guys to really transform your business from just what you do to an AI powered version of what you do.
**Speaker 0**: Does that make sense?
**Speaker 0**: Say yes, integrate it.
**Speaker 0**: We have to integrate it.
**Speaker 0**: Integrate it into your workflow because it doesn't replace the talent and empowers it.
**Speaker 0**: A lot of you are scared of AI.
**Speaker 0**: What about my job?
**Speaker 0**: What about my job?
**Speaker 0**: I'm telling you, it will not replace you if you use it.
**Speaker 0**: It'll just make you more powerful.
**Speaker 0**: Just like I'd rather not do the laundry.
**Speaker 0**: If you get the time back, then you get to do higher skilled, higher leverage time.
**Speaker 0**: Here's the big idea, okay?
**Speaker 0**: I call it the difference between a director and a doer.
**Speaker 0**: Director and doer and this is the.
**Speaker 0**: That AI has just accelerated.
**Speaker 0**: We all need to become directors.
**Speaker 0**: The doing is going to be done by the computers.
**Speaker 0**: The AI, what is directing?
**Speaker 0**: Three things.
**Speaker 0**: Write these down.
**Speaker 0**: The first one is we need to have a vision.
**Speaker 0**: You have to build the skill of vision.
**Speaker 0**: What does vision mean?
**Speaker 0**: Vision means seeing a future that doesn't exist.
**Speaker 0**: That should.
**Speaker 0**: I don't want to blow your minds too much more because I feel like sometimes the AI is enough.
**Speaker 0**: Every person.
**Speaker 0**: Okay, well, I'll tell you.
**Speaker 0**: When it comes to vision, essentially nothing exists without first being seen in the mind of a person.
**Speaker 0**: Does everybody agree with that?
**Speaker 0**: Say yes.
**Speaker 0**: So everything in this room, this building, this city, the clothes we're wearing, those monitors, were first seen in the minds of people from the past.
**Speaker 0**: And technically, we're living in the future.
**Speaker 0**: People from the past.
**Speaker 0**: I clap that up because that's a cool idea.
**Speaker 0**: It's like, see what I'm saying?
**Speaker 0**: We need that vision.
**Speaker 0**: AI can't do that.
**Speaker 0**: AI can just tell you what we've done so far.
**Speaker 0**: As humans.
**Speaker 0**: You can't create vision.
**Speaker 0**: Second one is taste.
**Speaker 0**: Taste.
**Speaker 0**: You ever hear a song?
**Speaker 0**: Don't like that song.
**Speaker 0**: Hear a song.
**Speaker 0**: Love that song.
**Speaker 0**: Taste.
**Speaker 0**: These are things we can develop.
**Speaker 0**: How?
**Speaker 0**: By studying greatness.
**Speaker 0**: You're in this room because you're studying greatness.
**Speaker 0**: The more studying greatness, the more you can see greatness.
**Speaker 0**: Third thing is care.
**Speaker 0**: They call it tbc, meaning taste, vision, and care.
**Speaker 0**: Care means emotional intelligence.
**Speaker 0**: Care means that I show up and have conversations.
**Speaker 0**: A lot of people when they hear AI, it scares them because they're like, well, where are the humans involved?
**Speaker 0**: Guess what?
**Speaker 0**: As long as humans are involved, humans will be involved.
**Speaker 0**: If I don't have to sit there and do data entry in my CRM, and instead I can pick up the phone and have a real conversation with a human.
**Speaker 0**: I'd rather do that if I don't have to sit there and like, pull all these crazy reports because it texts me in real time when I need to know something.
**Speaker 0**: And instead of running those reports, I can be out in the world at events like this, talking to my customers.
**Speaker 0**: That's a better use of your time.
**Speaker 0**: Does that make sense?
**Speaker 0**: Yes.
**Speaker 0**: So we integrated.
**Speaker 0**: Okay, So I want to ask you to write down what's one to three workflows in your business right now that you know, if you could automate, would have the biggest impact to your bottom line.
**Speaker 0**: Write those down in the chat.
**Speaker 0**: I want to hear them on Zoo.
**Speaker 0**: Sam.
**Speaker 0**: Alistair says CRM.
**Speaker 0**: Cold calls, scheduling emails.
**Speaker 0**: Love that Barber ads.
**Speaker 0**: Let's fill up the chat.
**Speaker 0**: This is what we make a commitment.
**Speaker 0**: All right, Everyone should have one of three projects when you get back to your office.
**Speaker 0**: This is the workbook.
**Speaker 0**: Walk through it with your team and dedicate yourself to creating this.
**Speaker 0**: So that's the integration into the workflow, into our business.
**Speaker 0**: Okay, we have both tools that are off the shelf and you have the ability to hire a programmer, hire an AI automation expert, hire a prompt engineer to come in and start helping you integrate this into your workflow.
**Speaker 0**: Now I want to show you a little bit more.
**Speaker 0**: You guys want to see more?
**Speaker 0**: Say yes.
**Speaker 0**: This is how we create AI.
**Speaker 0**: This is the creative side.
**Speaker 0**: See, when I said the director and the doer, okay, the winners of the future are like the chef in the kitchen.
**Speaker 0**: The chef in a really high end Michelin star kitchen.
**Speaker 0**: They're coordinating.
**Speaker 0**: They have somebody doing the legumes, they have somebody doing the pasta, they have somebody doing the protein.
**Speaker 0**: And what the chef does is he sits there and it all comes to him and he plates it.
**Speaker 0**: He has the vision for the meals, he figures out the taste profile, the acidity, the salt, that kind of thing.
**Speaker 0**: And that's what I want to encourage you to consider as you're to going job is to think as a director, creating the future.
**Speaker 0**: How do we do that?
**Speaker 0**: Well, first off, generative photos, you probably already know this, but AI can generate any photo that you might need.
**Speaker 0**: Okay, so you might have photos you need for social media.
**Speaker 0**: One of my, my best friend Nick, who does the science stuff, when I explained to him that he found a tool that generates the finished sign, essentially had an estimator, full time person that now can use the AI to generate the sign based on what the customer asked for.
**Speaker 0**: They record the call, they put that through the application, the AI takes that generates the photo of the sign.
**Speaker 0**: And then now the estimator can do five times more volume.
**Speaker 0**: Wild.
**Speaker 0**: I don't clap that up.
**Speaker 0**: It's crazy.
**Speaker 0**: I might go five times more volume.
**Speaker 0**: So let's keep it simple.
**Speaker 0**: There's a tool called canva.
**Speaker 0**: If you don't know it's free and it has AI built right into it.
**Speaker 0**: So again, the way you generate the photos is not the way we used to do it.
**Speaker 0**: We had to draw.
**Speaker 0**: You talk to it to the degree that you can specify with your words, English, the detail, and really any language at this point, the detail you want from the photo, AI can generate that.
**Speaker 0**: Isn't that cool?
**Speaker 0**: Say yes.
**Speaker 0**: So photos is taken care of, estimates are taken care of, drawings, diagrams.
**Speaker 0**: Now we got generative voice.
**Speaker 0**: This one scares people.
**Speaker 0**: But again, I'm gonna let you know, the world is going there.
**Speaker 0**: If you don't like it, unfortunately, then don't upgrade your iPhone because, like, humans are really good at wanting progress.
**Speaker 0**: If you have kids, you probably all said the same thing.
**Speaker 0**: I want to provide a future for my kids are better than the one I have.
**Speaker 0**: So it's part of our human DNA.
**Speaker 0**: So generate voice is interesting.
**Speaker 0**: I mean, I see, like I mentioned, my buddy Matt uses it for inbound calls to his gym studio.
**Speaker 0**: I have a friend, has a logistics company.
**Speaker 0**: He's used it to call all the truckers to answer.
**Speaker 0**: And he created this voice named Lisa.
**Speaker 0**: The truckers love Lisa.
**Speaker 0**: Lisa's very nice and patient Southern accent.
**Speaker 0**: And she said, hey, Bob, it's Lisa calling from ABC Truck.
**Speaker 0**: And we just wonder if you got that load on your truck and when do you think you might get it by the place we need to bring it to you.
**Speaker 0**: And all of a sudden, a process that was not efficient or cost effective to do at scale, they used voice AI to call all the truckers so they could increase their availability and capacity.
**Speaker 0**: Isn't that crazy?
**Speaker 0**: Say yes.
**Speaker 0**: Yes.
**Speaker 0**: Now, the downside, if you hear an ad of Joe Rogan promoting a sales CRM, I will let you know that Joe Rogan did not read that ad.
**Speaker 0**: And that's the downside.
**Speaker 0**: Its power is you can take your voice with literally a minute worth of you talking and generate a full AI version of your voice where you can send up voices, messages to customers and thank them for coming on board and reaching out to them at Christmas and using something that is posted on social media, personalize, you essentially can automate what you would do at scale if you had the time.
**Speaker 0**: But the downside is there's a lot of fraud going on.
**Speaker 0**: So I'm going to give you something that could be the most powerful, important thing here.
**Speaker 0**: This whole event.
**Speaker 0**: Have a word.
**Speaker 0**: Your family and your team knows, ideally, not to say same time, so that if somebody ever calls asking you to go buy gift cards at staples because the CEOs in a meeting, he doesn't have time, and he's got a client meeting, he needs a gift, you go, what's the word?
**Speaker 0**: Does that make sense?
**Speaker 0**: Say yes.
**Speaker 0**: Okay.
**Speaker 0**: If you get a call from your mother and she's in a panic and she needs the password to her don't.
**Speaker 0**: What's the word?
**Speaker 0**: That's where we're at.
**Speaker 0**: Because they could take the videos from your Facebook page and.
**Speaker 0**: And that's Just.
**Speaker 0**: I just want you guys to be safe.
**Speaker 0**: Okay?
**Speaker 0**: So this has nothing to do with the business side?
**Speaker 0**: Well, it does, but it's just one of those things.
**Speaker 0**: Okay.
**Speaker 0**: With great power comes great responsibility.
**Speaker 0**: Yes.
**Speaker 0**: Let's hear it.
**Speaker 0**: Clap it up.
**Speaker 0**: Now you know how to protect yourself.
**Speaker 0**: Again, if you learn nothing else, that might be the most important things for you and your team and your family.
**Speaker 0**: Generative wisdom.
**Speaker 0**: We've seen this with Tony's AI and many other people, but when this came out, it changed my life.
**Speaker 0**: The ability to index everything I've ever said, internal zoom calls.
**Speaker 0**: So I want to encourage you.
**Speaker 0**: Record everything you're doing.
**Speaker 0**: Default record.
**Speaker 0**: If you have a zoom account, go in, set the setting.
**Speaker 0**: Always report to cloud, because if you report everything you do, you'll have the data to train the AI.
**Speaker 0**: So when I started creating content three years ago and I lived on the other side of a camera, I had a bunch of stuff already recorded.
**Speaker 0**: My YouTube, my podcast, all the new stuff, and I fed it to AI, all my training for my clients.
**Speaker 0**: And there's tools like Membership IO.
**Speaker 0**: Okay, go check it out.
**Speaker 0**: It's crazy.
**Speaker 0**: If you have like a members area and you want to have an automatic AI, it then takes all that information and gives it to your clients.
**Speaker 0**: So here's it.
**Speaker 0**: You know, they use this funny AI avatar, but essentially you can ask it any question and it answers.
**Speaker 0**: And I know in 2025 that's not that impressive for some people.
**Speaker 0**: I'll tell you what's really cool.
**Speaker 0**: This feature, not only does it answer the question, it tells the person where to go, find out the information it used to answer the question, and lets the person dive in deep.
**Speaker 0**: So think about it.
**Speaker 0**: If you have a person that's like the account manager for your customers or a coach on your team, and they want to give answers to questions from people emailing, but you want to give them a link to the deeper answer, that tool automatically does it for you.
**Speaker 0**: I call that generative wisdom.
**Speaker 0**: Big idea.
**Speaker 0**: How many would like to learn, let's say, Apple's philosophy for designing products?
**Speaker 0**: Say yes.
**Speaker 0**: What about Netflix for culture?
**Speaker 0**: Say yes.
**Speaker 0**: Here's where the future is going.
**Speaker 0**: We will be available in the near future.
**Speaker 0**: You'll be able to essentially buy the generative organizational knowledge around the topic of.
**Speaker 0**: Of a company and plug it into your business.
**Speaker 0**: I know it's crazy, but that's where we're going.
**Speaker 0**: And I think that is really powerful.
**Speaker 0**: If you think about, hey, I want to get into fitness.
**Speaker 0**: I'd love to have, you know, this person's philosophy on fitness as, like, the core that my team talks to.
**Speaker 0**: You'll be able to license that.
**Speaker 0**: If you have that, you'll be able to license it out to other people.
**Speaker 0**: That's why I encourage everybody to record what you're doing today.
**Speaker 0**: Okay, next level is Generative Video.
**Speaker 0**: Let me go back.
**Speaker 0**: Okay.
**Speaker 0**: Generative Video.
**Speaker 0**: It's gotten real good.
**Speaker 0**: I showed you the demo at the beginning.
**Speaker 0**: Kind of freaky photo video.
**Speaker 0**: Realistic.
**Speaker 0**: So Arnold Schwarzenegger, you guys know who he is?
**Speaker 0**: Kind of a big buck dude.
**Speaker 0**: You know Arnold, he has a podcast called the Pump Club.
**Speaker 0**: He has an app called the Pump Club.
**Speaker 0**: He has never recorded an episode of Pump Club.
**Speaker 0**: It's been going on for two years.
**Speaker 0**: It's one of the most popular podcasts.
**Speaker 0**: They try.
**Speaker 0**: They send all the traffic to the app.
**Speaker 0**: All of it is generated through AI, and that is the future.
**Speaker 0**: I don't love it, but I can't fight it, because that's where we're going.
**Speaker 0**: I remember I was on a call with these AI do an AI expert round table.
**Speaker 0**: I was on the call, and somebody asked me, what are your thoughts on these AI avatars?
**Speaker 0**: And I was like, oh, I'm all, I'm the curious of the people and the soul.
**Speaker 0**: And this, you know, AI avatar is not going to work.
**Speaker 0**: And I invited them on that call because I saw their social media account, right?
**Speaker 0**: Their Instagram, their Tik Toks.
**Speaker 0**: The guy that asked me the question said, well, that's interesting, Dan, because I just want you to know that that's not me on my Tik Tok account.
**Speaker 0**: And the other guy pipes up.
**Speaker 0**: He's like, yeah, Dan, that Instagram.
**Speaker 0**: My Instagram is not me.
**Speaker 0**: It's AI Avatar.
**Speaker 0**: This other guy from India, million followers, only been around for six months.
**Speaker 0**: He built a million followers.
**Speaker 0**: He goes, hey, that's fine.
**Speaker 0**: Neither am I. AI avatar fooled me.
**Speaker 0**: So I told that to my team.
**Speaker 0**: This is a month ago.
**Speaker 0**: This is recent.
**Speaker 0**: My team goes, oh, yeah, Dan, you're one AI prompt away from changing your life.
**Speaker 0**: Most people think AI is some complicated future tech.
**Speaker 0**: It's not.
**Speaker 0**: It's right here, right now.
**Speaker 0**: The winners of this next decade, they're not the smartest.
**Speaker 0**: They're the most resourceful.
**Speaker 0**: They're the ones who keep asking, what can AI help me do faster, better, cheaper.
**Speaker 0**: So stop waiting for your future.
**Speaker 0**: You're the one who gets the building.
**Speaker 0**: I didn't even say that stuff.
**Speaker 0**: I know.
**Speaker 0**: What am I gonna do with my time if I buy it all back?
**Speaker 0**: Don't be so Romantic.
**Speaker 0**: You miss the plot.
**Speaker 0**: Trust me, I'm coming from a guy that loves the creative arts.
**Speaker 0**: I love writing my own books.
**Speaker 0**: I love shooting content.
**Speaker 0**: I love the.
**Speaker 0**: The craftsmanship, the artistry of it.
**Speaker 0**: But at the same time, let me remind you, how many of you watch cartoons growing up?
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, you guys don't care.
**Speaker 0**: You just want to be entertained.
**Speaker 0**: You want to be educated.
**Speaker 0**: And if the tool can help you do that at scale and impact, millions of people.
**Speaker 0**: Don't fight it.
**Speaker 0**: Learn to use it.
**Speaker 0**: That's what we got to learn to generate.
**Speaker 0**: Okay, Cap, cut.
**Speaker 0**: AI Video.
**Speaker 0**: My son's been editing videos for three and a half years using AI it's part of the product.
**Speaker 0**: Every one of you guys can download this and use it.
**Speaker 0**: And again, it's all in the resources I give you.
**Speaker 0**: Then there's generative work.
**Speaker 0**: Okay, generative work is this.
**Speaker 0**: There's a guy that created a robotics company called Brett Adkoff, and he said.
**Speaker 0**: He said, the business we're in is we're selling work.
**Speaker 0**: And he calls it the 3D, says Dull, Dangerous, or dirty.
**Speaker 0**: Nobody's fighting him for that kind of work.
**Speaker 0**: Okay?
**Speaker 0**: It's a robotics company going after dull, dangerous, or dirty work.
**Speaker 0**: And it's gotten a little crazy.
**Speaker 0**: So you've already heard this thing called agentic, maybe agents.
**Speaker 0**: The way I want you to think about this is like if I had a lemonade stand in the future, I'll have an agent that is in charge of just monitoring and ordering the lemons, and then I'll have another agent that takes the lemons and it will make the lemonade.
**Speaker 0**: And then I'll have another agent that will sell the lemonade, and then I'll have another agent that takes care of the accounting from the sales, and then that will talk to a procurement, you know, agent that I said, and then buys more license in that system.
**Speaker 0**: So the thinking I want you to have is how do I create these agents around specific work in my business?
**Speaker 0**: So customer support and marketing are the ones we talked about from a tools point of view.
**Speaker 0**: But it's not just using the tool to do the work.
**Speaker 0**: It's literally having the agent do all of the work.
**Speaker 0**: And this is what I talked about in kind of the next level of business mastery, the next program, Tony.
**Speaker 0**: But I wanted you guys to understand how to think about it if you want to apply to your life today.
**Speaker 0**: The other area, this one freaked.
**Speaker 0**: My buddy Nick, who's a sign guy, is robotics.
**Speaker 0**: So, as I mentioned, Brett adcock is the CEO of Robotics Company.
**Speaker 0**: It's called Figure 2.
**Speaker 0**: I track personally 10 companies, robotics companies, they all use what's called the humanoid form factor.
**Speaker 0**: Why?
**Speaker 0**: Because the world was built for us.
**Speaker 0**: So if you use a humanoid form factor and there's a tool, it can work with robots.
**Speaker 0**: But I just don't know.
**Speaker 0**: This is not even the most recent because he hasn't released the new version of it, but this is about 4 months old.
**Speaker 0**: This is what it.
**Speaker 1**: Figure 02 has significant technical advancements enabling the robot to perform a wide range of complex tasks fully autonomously.
**Speaker 1**: According to figure the figure 02 is the world's most advanced humanoid robot on the market.
**Speaker 1**: It combines two legged mobility with advanced dexterity, making it perfect for handling physically demanding, unsafe or repetitive tasks.
**Speaker 1**: For the first time, BMW Group is exploring the use of humanoid robots in their production line.
**Speaker 1**: Over several weeks at the BMW Group plant, Spartanburg.
**Speaker 1**: The figure 02 robot from California based company Figure successfully inserted sheet metal parts into specific fixtures, a crucial step in assembling the car chassis.
**Speaker 1**: The introduction of humanoid robots like Figaro 2 is a game changer for BMW.
**Speaker 0**: Pop it up, pop it up.
**Speaker 0**: We're gonna land the plane.
**Speaker 0**: You know what I love about everybody in this room and you guys at home is you're getting it.
**Speaker 0**: I, I see it in your eyes.
**Speaker 0**: I talk to a lot of people about this.
**Speaker 0**: Some people, they're not ready for it.
**Speaker 0**: You're ready for it.
**Speaker 0**: I can see you.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, clap it up for yourself.
**Speaker 0**: This is the big idea.
**Speaker 0**: Generative AI automates creative outputs.
**Speaker 0**: It automates creative outputs.
**Speaker 0**: I want you to be more creative.
**Speaker 0**: I want to create more.
**Speaker 0**: We are creators.
**Speaker 0**: Say we are creators.
**Speaker 0**: Creators want to create.
**Speaker 0**: I don't want to do laundry.
**Speaker 0**: No laundry.
**Speaker 0**: I'm going to sit down and I'm going to create.
**Speaker 0**: I'm going to have my taste, I'm going to have my vision.
**Speaker 0**: I'm going to care about the people I love and anything that I don't need to do because I already thought about it once, I don't want to do it again.
**Speaker 0**: That is the world to get to live in.
**Speaker 0**: So I want you to write down what are the three tasks you can use?
**Speaker 0**: Generative AI, Maybe robotics, if you're in that field, maybe generative video.
**Speaker 0**: You're in that field.
**Speaker 0**: Maybe just getting out of some process that does go to break down those three tasks.
**Speaker 0**: Three things.
**Speaker 0**: You're at home.
**Speaker 0**: Download the workbook.
**Speaker 0**: It's in the portal.
**Speaker 0**: You gotta get home.
**Speaker 0**: You can download it to finish off this process, but when you're done, it'll take you 15 minutes, you will have a game plan for integrating AI.
**Speaker 0**: Does that sound like fun?
**Speaker 0**: So yes.
**Speaker 0**: Okay.
**Speaker 0**: For those that decide, Tony asked me, he said, hey, Dan, I know that you can only take teach so much in this room.
**Speaker 0**: When we do the ultimate Business Mastery, can you add something to those that are willing to commit and go further?
**Speaker 0**: Okay.
**Speaker 0**: I started in Tony's world at David.
**Speaker 0**: Destiny came to business mastery just like you and my team.
**Speaker 0**: And then eventually did ut del.
**Speaker 0**: I kind of did the reverse way.
**Speaker 0**: Okay.
**Speaker 0**: And I'm telling you to change everything.
**Speaker 0**: So if you want to learn more from me yet, follow me on Instagram.
**Speaker 0**: Instagram, Dan Martel.
**Speaker 0**: Martel.com or Instagram, give me a follow there.
**Speaker 0**: Because I post videos on AI and so far that's still me.
**Speaker 0**: There's one experiment we'll see.
**Speaker 0**: You can tell the difference.
**Speaker 0**: We always say in the description of his AI, but I have the AI coaching model, which is essentially for the coaches.
**Speaker 0**: How many of you guys are teachers?
**Speaker 0**: Coaches, consultants in the room?
**Speaker 0**: Show man.
**Speaker 0**: I'm gonna teach you how to make yourself disruption proof.
**Speaker 0**: Because the biggest concern here, coach, is if the AI can give the answer to my clients.
**Speaker 0**: And what do I do?
**Speaker 0**: I call it neural transformation.
**Speaker 0**: And I teach that in that video.
**Speaker 0**: So you get that if you enroll in ultimate business mastery and then my AI prompts for if you didn't know, I wrote a best selling book called buy back your time.
**Speaker 0**: And a lot of people go, well with AI in the book.
**Speaker 0**: How would you use AI?
**Speaker 0**: So I created all of my advanced prompts using my prompting format that you can copy, paste to get the whole book, almost every chapter done for you, and that's part of it.
**Speaker 0**: So if you enroll in that, that's my gift to you now.
**Speaker 0**: Thank you.
**Speaker 0**: Clap it up, everybody.
**Speaker 0**: I want to share this last story.
**Speaker 0**: Eight years ago, I came to business master and I sat in the chair just like you.
**Speaker 0**: And on integration day, we were writing down our goals.
**Speaker 0**: I wrote down speak on this stage, Sa Sam.
