**Jdawson**: Well, I may be.
**Jdawson**: I have my other computer, my business computer here, and I can log in.
**Jdawson**: But then to get to.
**Jdawson**: Jesse has set up, set me up so I can have a, have a, an icon at the bottom of the screen.

**Jdawson**: Not much there yet, but yeah, I understand why and that there isn't.
**Jdawson**: But I do have that and that's set up so I can have access to those.

**Jdawson**: Well, losing any confidence.
**Jdawson**: Any confidence in him, you know, when somebody doesn't return a call.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I can understand he might be busy or distracted or whatever.
**Jdawson**: But not a day and a half or two days later when he was.

**Jdawson**: Okay, well, thought I would check.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: If I can find out.
**Jdawson**: I mean, I can understand if he.
**Jdawson**: If he's living down there, he doesn't want to do it, but you know, he ought to just say it.

**Jdawson**: They have attitude, the contractor developer attitude.
**Jdawson**: And they just could do what they want to do when they want to do it.
**Jdawson**: So we'll see.

**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Ken.johnson1**: Yep.
**Ken.johnson1**: So go ahead, click that.

**Ken.johnson1**: Okay, perfect.
**Ken.johnson1**: All right, can you see me?
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Ken.johnson1**: Okay, great.
**Ken.johnson1**: All right, so at, at the top right, you should see a red button that says leave.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Ken.johnson1**: Okay.
**Ken.johnson1**: There's the left of that.
**Ken.johnson1**: It says share.
**Jdawson**: Oh, yeah, I am, I'm familiar with that.
**Ken.johnson1**: But go ahead and share your screen, if you would, please.
**Ken.johnson1**: I don't know what your computer knowledge is, so forgive me.
**Jdawson**: Well, it's.
**Jdawson**: I went through a lot yesterday trying to get this computer to work with Jesse, and then I, I hadn't updated my iPhone since 12.
**Jdawson**: Oh.
**Jdawson**: IOS and to 18.
**Jdawson**: So that's a little bit of confusion there.
**Ken.johnson1**: But you have to hide.
**Ken.johnson1**: I just requested to take control.
**Ken.johnson1**: Did you see that notification?
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Ken.johnson1**: Accept that.
**Ken.johnson1**: All right, so there we go.
**Ken.johnson1**: Okay, perfect.
**Ken.johnson1**: Okay, so now.
**Ken.johnson1**: All right, so there's this.
**Ken.johnson1**: So there's this.
**Ken.johnson1**: So we're going to click here.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Ken.johnson1**: You chat.
**Ken.johnson1**: All right, so we're going to pin to your taskbar.
**Ken.johnson1**: So that's there now.
**Ken.johnson1**: So now you need blue beam.
**Ken.johnson1**: Right.
**Ken.johnson1**: So come here.
**Jdawson**: It's the last one on the bottom.
**Jdawson**: Looking for a.
**Jdawson**: Yep, got it right here.
**Ken.johnson1**: Not interested.
**Jdawson**: Now, do you, do you typically do PDFs through Bluebeam?
**Ken.johnson1**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Ken.johnson1**: What do you usually do?
**Jdawson**: Well, just a document folder for PDFs.
**Ken.johnson1**: Well, so, like, so Microsoft.
**Ken.johnson1**: Okay, so usually what we, what we do is like, so you have a one drive, right?
**Ken.johnson1**: Okay.
**Ken.johnson1**: And so in your one drive.
**Jdawson**: Like.
**Ken.johnson1**: We have all the, all these documents.
**Ken.johnson1**: So if you come in here into the job folder.
**Ken.johnson1**: Right.
**Jdawson**: So, yeah, I've been in that.
**Jdawson**: Brandon and Jesse went through that with me this morning.
**Jdawson**: So, yeah, I, I've gone into there a bit, but there's not, not much in there yet.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Ken.johnson1**: When I say.
**Ken.johnson1**: When I say.
**Ken.johnson1**: Well, it's probably just loading.
**Ken.johnson1**: Yeah, it's all loading.
**Ken.johnson1**: When I say, like, I use Bluebeam, I use it to view PDF.
**Ken.johnson1**: As far as document storage, it's.
**Ken.johnson1**: It's in OneDrive.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Ken.johnson1**: Yeah.
**Ken.johnson1**: All right, so here we go.
**Ken.johnson1**: Do I click Create movie id?
**Ken.johnson1**: Great.
**Ken.johnson1**: You go, I can.
**Ken.johnson1**: Or can it.
**Jdawson**: Can you?
**Ken.johnson1**: Yeah.
**Ken.johnson1**: What do you want your password to be?
**Jdawson**: Needs to be probably 8 Ken capital K lowercase Enson, $81 sign K E.
**Ken.johnson1**: N S O N $81 sign, right?
**Jdawson**: What's that significant part of first name, part of last name, and an 81.
**Jdawson**: That's long, long ago in the galaxy far, far away when I first got a general contractor's license, a young man.
**Ken.johnson1**: Here.
**Ken.johnson1**: All right, so that's all set up.
**Ken.johnson1**: Do you use Google or what do you like to use for your search engine?
**Ken.johnson1**: Usually Google.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, Firefox also.
**Jdawson**: But I, I used personal personal ID or personal email on Firefox, but Google's fine.
**Ken.johnson1**: Well, yeah, I just, I'm just going to make whatever your deep.
**Ken.johnson1**: What do you want your default search to be?
**Ken.johnson1**: I was just going to do Google Chrome.
**Ken.johnson1**: I don't know where to use.
**Jdawson**: No, that's good.
**Jdawson**: Did I lose you?
**Ken.johnson1**: No, I'm here.
**Ken.johnson1**: Oh, okay.
**Ken.johnson1**: Yeah, yeah, just screen sticking for some reason.
**Jdawson**: What version is the Blue Beam, Brandon?
**Ken.johnson1**: Whatever the new one is.
**Ken.johnson1**: Okay, you got to give me permission to take control again.
**Ken.johnson1**: I just try.
**Ken.johnson1**: There we go.
**Ken.johnson1**: Yeah, we just.
**Ken.johnson1**: The subscription.
**Jdawson**: So, yeah, I have, I haven't used it very much in the last three or four years and I had.
**Jdawson**: The version I have personally is pretty old.
**Ken.johnson1**: What did you guys use for your PDF stuff?
**Jdawson**: Oh, this is Microsoft.
**Ken.johnson1**: Like, it's like Adobe.
**Ken.johnson1**: Yeah, gotcha.
**Ken.johnson1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Ken.johnson1**: So you should get this one.
**Ken.johnson1**: Do you have a Google Chrome account you want to sign into?
**Jdawson**: No, I don't know what the.
**Jdawson**: I don't know the password offhand right now.
**Ken.johnson1**: Okay.
**Ken.johnson1**: Yeah, so you can, you can just sign that later if you want.
**Ken.johnson1**: Doesn't matter.
**Ken.johnson1**: So, all right, so I just went ahead and I made Google's now your.
**Ken.johnson1**: Your default.
**Ken.johnson1**: Okay.
**Ken.johnson1**: So for everything that you do for your search engine.
**Ken.johnson1**: Okay, so boom, got it.
**Ken.johnson1**: So that'll matter.
**Ken.johnson1**: If you like, say your passwords on here or anything like that, you'll want to, you know, at least either create one or sign into one or something like that.
**Ken.johnson1**: So I'm going to get.
**Ken.johnson1**: Right click here.
**Ken.johnson1**: I'm going to do the same thing.
**Ken.johnson1**: I'm going to pin the taskbar.
**Ken.johnson1**: So that's there.
**Ken.johnson1**: Then I'm going to come here, I'm going to delete this.
**Ken.johnson1**: Because you don't really care about that.
**Jdawson**: Let me ask you, is signing in my.
**Jdawson**: Signing in with Google on.
**Jdawson**: On the, on your computer going to affect my access on my personal one?
**Ken.johnson1**: Because I.
**Jdawson**: Okay, I use both Firefox and Google mostly.
**Ken.johnson1**: Yeah, it doesn't matter.
**Ken.johnson1**: So, like me, like it matters, I guess.
**Ken.johnson1**: But like my, my Google that I'm signed on to here, like on my computer is my personal GMAIL account.
**Ken.johnson1**: And then I also have it on my.
**Ken.johnson1**: My personal computer at home.
**Ken.johnson1**: Like it.
**Ken.johnson1**: You know, and it's on my phone.
**Ken.johnson1**: It doesn't matter.
**Ken.johnson1**: It's all synced.
**Ken.johnson1**: It doesn't change anything.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Ken.johnson1**: All right, so.
**Ken.johnson1**: So now it's set up.
**Ken.johnson1**: All right, and then unpin this because you don't use Microsoft, and then you don't need copilot do that.
**Ken.johnson1**: All right, so here's the boot mean.
**Ken.johnson1**: Come on.
**Jdawson**: Did it knock you off again?
**Jdawson**: Looks like it, yeah.
**Jdawson**: Just saying.
**Jdawson**: I'm getting up on screen.
**Jdawson**: I said, do you want to allow this app to make changes to your device, Blue Beam?
**Ken.johnson1**: Yeah.
**Ken.johnson1**: Just say yes.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Ken.johnson1**: It's requested to take control again.
**Jdawson**: It's still popping that one up.
**Jdawson**: It won't let me change from no to yes on the.
**Jdawson**: There you go.
**Jdawson**: Maybe that worked.
**Ken.johnson1**: There's another one down here.
**Ken.johnson1**: Click it.
**Ken.johnson1**: Say yes.
**Ken.johnson1**: Just say yeah.
**Ken.johnson1**: All right, now we're cooking with gas.
**Ken.johnson1**: Did you click that next button?
**Ken.johnson1**: I don't know why it's not working for me.
**Ken.johnson1**: You see that?
**Ken.johnson1**: Can you click this next button?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, sorry.
**Ken.johnson1**: All right, click sign in.
**Ken.johnson1**: I must have typed that in wrong.
**Ken.johnson1**: Katie Johnson.
**Ken.johnson1**: All right, try again.
**Ken.johnson1**: K E, S O.
**Jdawson**: No.
**Ken.johnson1**: Sign it again for you.
**Jdawson**: Is that your.
**Jdawson**: The Microsoft password or your company?
**Ken.johnson1**: That's the password you just gave me.
**Jdawson**: Oh, okay.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Ken.johnson1**: Is that not your Microsoft password?
**Jdawson**: Is it capital K?
**Ken.johnson1**: That's O.
**Ken.johnson1**: So it's K E s o n.
**Ken.johnson1**: $81 sign, right?
**Ken.johnson1**: Try it.
**Ken.johnson1**: Did I say your name right?
**Ken.johnson1**: K H A O H.
**Ken.johnson1**: Oh, I did.
**Ken.johnson1**: I did spell that right.
**Jdawson**: J O H N S O, N.
**Jdawson**: But it's just Ken.
**Jdawson**: It's.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: K E N S O N.
**Jdawson**: Capital K with K E n s o n.
**Jdawson**: $81 sign.
**Ken.johnson1**: All right, not bad.
**Ken.johnson1**: I'll try it.
**Ken.johnson1**: All right, well, we're going to play with that in a minute here.
**Ken.johnson1**: Let's get through the blue beam.
**Ken.johnson1**: Let this work.
**Ken.johnson1**: See if you can click.
**Ken.johnson1**: Can you click this minus sign here?
**Ken.johnson1**: Wait for this.
**Ken.johnson1**: It's a finish.
**Ken.johnson1**: Okay.
**Ken.johnson1**: Press okay.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Again.
**Ken.johnson1**: Yep.
**Ken.johnson1**: Okay, and now let's click install right here.
**Ken.johnson1**: Click this.
**Ken.johnson1**: I don't know why it's not letting me click, so click that install button.
**Ken.johnson1**: Please undo control and try it again here.
**Jdawson**: Do you want control back?
**Ken.johnson1**: Yep.
**Ken.johnson1**: Exert.
**Jdawson**: Do you estimate is using Blue Beam for estimating.
**Ken.johnson1**: Like, takeoffs?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Ken.johnson1**: Yeah, that's the best way to do it.
**Ken.johnson1**: I mean, that's how I always done it.
**Ken.johnson1**: We don't do a ton of, like, quantity takeoffs.
**Ken.johnson1**: Right.
**Ken.johnson1**: We're not.
**Ken.johnson1**: We don't self defense form.
**Ken.johnson1**: So.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Ken.johnson1**: Why this isn't working now.
**Ken.johnson1**: So let me click.
**Ken.johnson1**: Can you right click this little blue beam emblem right here at the bottom where my cursor is?
**Jdawson**: Oh, right click.
**Ken.johnson1**: Yep.
**Ken.johnson1**: Press pin to taskbar.
**Ken.johnson1**: You go.
**Ken.johnson1**: Should be.
**Jdawson**: Brandon.
**Jdawson**: Why are.
**Jdawson**: Why are so many people leaving or have in the last few years?
**Jdawson**: DeAngelis diamond.
**Jdawson**: It's.
**Ken.johnson1**: That's not just a class of years.
**Ken.johnson1**: Seriously, it was a revolving door when I was there.
**Jdawson**: It's obvious it's just a revolving door.
**Ken.johnson1**: Yeah, they just get, you know, they get a ton of work and so then they hire a bunch of people that, you know, aren't necessarily qualified.
**Ken.johnson1**: And then some of the guys that are like, get fed up because it's very office politics again.
**Ken.johnson1**: And this is, you know, a decade ago.
**Ken.johnson1**: So maybe things have changed.
**Ken.johnson1**: Yeah.
**Ken.johnson1**: So I don't know.
**Ken.johnson1**: All right, I gotta jump in this other meeting real quick, but this will download and then you should be able to get set up.
**Ken.johnson1**: So I will.
**Ken.johnson1**: You can message me on teams and then as soon as I get done with this, I'll.
**Ken.johnson1**: I'll back in.
**Ken.johnson1**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that's good.
**Jdawson**: Thank you.
**Jdawson**: I appreciate it.
**Jdawson**: I have a few more questions on the.
**Jdawson**: On the emails.
**Ken.johnson1**: Yes, I'll bounce in after this meeting.
**Jdawson**: Thank you.
**Jdawson**: Thank you.
**Ken.johnson1**: All right, see you.

**Jdawson**: It.
**Jdawson**: Sage.
**Jdawson**: What.
**Ken.johnson1**: The floppy.
**Jdawson**: Hello?
**Jdawson**: I can hear you trying to get the video.
**Jdawson**: I was just plugging my phone in when you called to get to charge it up on my phone.
**Jdawson**: Now let me get on computer.
**Ken.johnson1**: Yeah, yeah, get on your computer.
**Jdawson**: Oh, man, you hear me?
**Ken.johnson1**: Yep.
**Ken.johnson1**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Got you.
**Jdawson**: Now.
**Jdawson**: I found a couple of things that I was concerned about.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: The video is not over my camera.
**Jdawson**: I'm looking for.
**Ken.johnson1**: It's.
**Ken.johnson1**: Yeah, yeah.
**Ken.johnson1**: Top right.
**Ken.johnson1**: I say loop.
**Ken.johnson1**: Yeah.
**Ken.johnson1**: It may be closed.
**Ken.johnson1**: On the top of your screen there's like a little slider.
**Ken.johnson1**: There you go.
**Jdawson**: Perfect.
**Ken.johnson1**: All right.
**Ken.johnson1**: What was your concern as you said?
**Jdawson**: A couple things I was trying to get into.
**Jdawson**: One was Notion for my.
**Jdawson**: For the emails.
**Jdawson**: I'm not familiar with Notion either.
**Jdawson**: I was doing.
**Jdawson**: I started a, a tutorial with that and I noticed that there was my concern was that two amazing notes.
**Jdawson**: But you had to go to a.
**Jdawson**: It wouldn't.
**Jdawson**: Wouldn't just open the email automatically.
**Jdawson**: You had to go get a number to add to that.
**Jdawson**: And from what I could tell in a little bit of video you could share your screen.
**Ken.johnson1**: Let me see here.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, sorry, I gotta get into.
**Jdawson**: I'm sending when I go to Notion.
**Jdawson**: Any, any.
**Jdawson**: Can you see that now?
**Ken.johnson1**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: When I go to.
**Jdawson**: To open.
**Jdawson**: And I kind of screwed it up because I kept continuing it.
**Jdawson**: But go to an email with Notion then would not let me.
**Jdawson**: I could go to page and then it lets.
**Jdawson**: Then it doesn't let me.
**Jdawson**: I don't know why.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Ken.johnson1**: There you guys can see here.
**Ken.johnson1**: Teeth, face.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Ken.johnson1**: Press right there.
**Ken.johnson1**: The Cilia group.
**Ken.johnson1**: So then you can press, press like my dashboard here.
**Ken.johnson1**: And so here's all the stuff that you kind of have in your core.
**Ken.johnson1**: So you don't have any credit card transactions.
**Ken.johnson1**: Actually you don't have any tasks.
**Ken.johnson1**: It doesn't look like assigned to you in Notion.
**Ken.johnson1**: So let's go back here.
**Ken.johnson1**: And so if you click on projects, so then you'll see all the different projects and their status.
**Ken.johnson1**: So you see the phase and everything.
**Ken.johnson1**: And so as you get acclimated, so you'll start to get tasks for different jobs.
**Ken.johnson1**: So let's just, let's look at the super.
**Ken.johnson1**: So if I open up this Westfield Collective job.
**Ken.johnson1**: So you can see here.
**Ken.johnson1**: So it's got all these different things like that need to be done and then who's taking care of them and then their due date.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Ken.johnson1**: And so that's, that's the idea.
**Ken.johnson1**: It's an all around organizational tracker things and then you mark your progress, blah, blah.
**Ken.johnson1**: And so you'll get there.
**Ken.johnson1**: So if we go to space.
**Ken.johnson1**: If you're going to be on Seminole.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, it was right above where you were.
**Jdawson**: There you go.
**Ken.johnson1**: Oh yeah, we can.
**Ken.johnson1**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: There's not much in.
**Jdawson**: The only thing in there I think now layout.
**Ken.johnson1**: Oh yeah.
**Ken.johnson1**: In the folder.
**Ken.johnson1**: Yeah there's not much in there.
**Ken.johnson1**: We got.
**Ken.johnson1**: We're waiting on the survey from the city so that we can start laying our stuff out.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Ken.johnson1**: But like you know the biggest thing is like you know the estimate like in like getting pricing for if we've got it in here.
**Ken.johnson1**: But container.
**Jdawson**: Yeah it's on the top, on the top here.
**Ken.johnson1**: Oh yeah, that's 59 container sub.
**Ken.johnson1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So I told Jesse I have a contact here in Tampa that does the container.
**Jdawson**: The container modification.
**Ken.johnson1**: Yeah so like this will.
**Ken.johnson1**: This will turn to you.
**Ken.johnson1**: So that, that so now that shows you.
**Ken.johnson1**: So if I came back here and your dashboard should show up right there.
**Ken.johnson1**: See okay so yeah so see you've got some things in here.
**Ken.johnson1**: So yeah you've mentioned some comments and then so if you want there's a desktop.
**Ken.johnson1**: Let's see here.
**Ken.johnson1**: That's why sa.
**Jdawson**: We'll do that download.
**Jdawson**: Pardon me.
**Jdawson**: Oh it wouldn't complete and it stopped.
**Jdawson**: Forget what the prompt was.
**Jdawson**: It wasn't.
**Jdawson**: It wouldn't go forward.
**Jdawson**: It's had disconnected.
**Jdawson**: I don't think I did anything to disconnect on the, the emails Brandon with the.
**Jdawson**: With not.
**Jdawson**: I got that.
**Jdawson**: That prompt again on the screen of.
**Jdawson**: Do you want to allow this app to make changes?
**Jdawson**: So yeah.
**Ken.johnson1**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: It's a two step verification for the opening that email.
**Jdawson**: So I have to go when I click on to try to get to the email and it gives me.
**Jdawson**: It tells a number for what email?
**Jdawson**: Well right here.
**Jdawson**: Well no, but any of them went with notion.
**Ken.johnson1**: I mean this is all to log in but you're logged in now so.
**Jdawson**: Okay, there you go.
**Jdawson**: Which is login.
**Jdawson**: Note to notion the number on that it asked me on each one it asked me for a number.
**Jdawson**: Well that's giving you a number but I mean the ones before that below the ones that came in.
**Jdawson**: Yeah on down that was on any of them or that were on notion.
**Jdawson**: Oh now I don't, I don't see that.
**Ken.johnson1**: Yeah I mean I don't know.
**Ken.johnson1**: I wouldn't worry about it.
**Ken.johnson1**: I mean you're in there now.
**Jdawson**: So I was in.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I'm in.
**Jdawson**: But it was giving me a two step process instead of just opening the opening the email was giving me another firewall of having to go back to.
**Jdawson**: To an email in my, in my end box that give me a code number before it would let me get into the email.
**Jdawson**: And then I saw very early in the little bit of the tutorial for the notion that there's A two step verification for that that you can either be enabled or disabled.
**Jdawson**: And it's under settings, I believe.
**Ken.johnson1**: Yeah, let me.
**Ken.johnson1**: So let's get you Bluebeam and we'll jump into that real quick.
**Ken.johnson1**: It looks like it's.
**Ken.johnson1**: It's working here but we'll test it here.
**Ken.johnson1**: So you should have.
**Ken.johnson1**: It's not letting me click something.
**Ken.johnson1**: Is there something going on with Bluebeam that says loading what it do?
**Ken.johnson1**: What do you see?
**Jdawson**: I don't remember now.
**Jdawson**: Something about it right now.
**Jdawson**: Right now.
**Jdawson**: I'm sorry.
**Ken.johnson1**: Okay, great.
**Ken.johnson1**: Press install.
**Ken.johnson1**: No, no, it's.
**Ken.johnson1**: It's loading right now.
**Ken.johnson1**: Yeah, see it's.
**Ken.johnson1**: So can I continue to the pending repo.
**Ken.johnson1**: That's why.
**Ken.johnson1**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Ken.johnson1**: Press.
**Ken.johnson1**: OK fine.
**Ken.johnson1**: Press finish.
**Ken.johnson1**: All right.
**Ken.johnson1**: And then click this little button right here.
**Jdawson**: I'm sorry, which one?
**Ken.johnson1**: Right here.
**Jdawson**: Two Reset.
**Ken.johnson1**: Yeah, there you go.
**Ken.johnson1**: So.
**Ken.johnson1**: So there you go.
**Ken.johnson1**: So that's why.
**Ken.johnson1**: That's why it's not working.
**Ken.johnson1**: All right.
**Ken.johnson1**: So.
**Ken.johnson1**: So press this button right here.
**Jdawson**: Can you see it all?
**Ken.johnson1**: Sa.
**Jdawson**: No word for it.
**Ken.johnson1**: Sa.
**Jdawson**: Can you hear me?
**Ken.johnson1**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: Started an update in the middle of that process.
**Jdawson**: Whatever.
**Jdawson**: It went directly to an update on the computer.
**Ken.johnson1**: Yeah, that's why I clicked that button.
**Ken.johnson1**: That's what I think was probably causing so much thing just as that yellow thing.
**Ken.johnson1**: Oh yeah.
**Ken.johnson1**: Hey, you gotta restart it.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Ken.johnson1**: Yeah.
**Ken.johnson1**: So do here.
**Ken.johnson1**: Share your screen again if you would please.
