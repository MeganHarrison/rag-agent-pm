## Transcript
**Jcurtin**: Morning, Jack.
**Jcurtin**: Morning, Jack.
**Jdawson**: Morning, Jack.
**Jdawson**: Hey, morning, y'.
**Jdawson**: All.
**Jcurtin**: What I'll be going on today on the job site.
**Jdawson**: I think I was muted again.
**Jdawson**: Griffin and them are expecting their material for underneath the canopy, so they'll be framing that up today.
**Jdawson**: They finished the parapet wall yesterday.
**Jdawson**: Rick's going to be continuing to work back at the footings of the dock door, and electrician is going to be continuing to work on his data drops and receps in the receiving area.
**Jdawson**: Flooring guy is going to be applying polish on the two offices and break room.
**Jdawson**: And then there's a portion right out front of those three rooms that he's going to be applying to polish to as well.
**Jdawson**: Then everybody's going to flip flop after lunch.
**Jdawson**: So then the flooring guy then can move over to the other area and receiving area by the donation vestibule.
**Jdawson**: And he's going to be.
**Jdawson**: Then he's going to be continuing to work on polishing over there.
**Jdawson**: We talked about.
**Jdawson**: Nick, I know we talked about yesterday maybe either having them polish the whole area all at once or if they could polish that area where the windows are going to go first.
**Jdawson**: It's already in densifying stage.
**Jdawson**: If they split that last Runway from north to south, they split it in half and do from donation vestibule south, then they could finish that up and we could get the windows installed on the 4th.
**Jdawson**: So that would, that would give, that would give the framers all week of the 28th, and then we can have windows stalled as early as the fourth, like Diamond Glass mentioned to us.
**Jdawson**: The only thing is, I'll reiterate this plan with Blakely, how they feel about it.
**Jdawson**: I know they emphasized that they wanted to like, catch the far north end up to densifying with the south end of that Runway and then polish all of it at once.
**Jdawson**: So let me.
**Jdawson**: I'm gonna see where their heads at about splitting that up and, and how they, how they handle that or, you know, if, if, if they push back on not splitting it up.
**Jdawson**: Worst case scenario, then we just have windows installed on the 11th.
**Jdawson**: And I frame everything on the week of the 4th of August.
**Jdawson**: But that still puts us a week ahead when originally on the schedule, I had windows being installed on the 18th.
**Ksipe**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: How is McCrae doing with the footings?
**Jdawson**: Doing good, Doing good.
**Ksipe**: He got.
**Jdawson**: He got mostly yesterday was about getting just extra dirt out and made sure that they put an inlet protection on that back drain.
**Jdawson**: They put them on the, on the other three, but then they forgot that one.
**Jdawson**: So they brought an inlet Protection for that.
**Jdawson**: Before the Rick and them excavated the dirt, I had the laborers tear up that area where we were talking about a drain being there.
**Jdawson**: And it was like half the drain grate was broken so it covered up with dirt.
**Jdawson**: So they cleaned it all out.
**Jdawson**: And then I had like an extendo flathead and I had them fish out both.
**Jdawson**: I had them fish out the end that drains into the drain next to it.
**Jdawson**: So McRae covered it up again with trying to do their footings.
**Jdawson**: I just told them to please make sure when they're done done to get some shovels and.
**Jdawson**: And clean that back out.
**Jcurtin**: You're on mute, Jesse.
**Ksipe**: That drain isn't left open.
**Ksipe**: If it rains, it's going to flood the back area.
**Ksipe**: And you can't have a bunch of dirt in it or it's just going to wash all that dirt into the storm system.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So we'll work on getting that cleaned out today.
**Jdawson**: And then I guess I'll have to find.
**Jdawson**: I've never had to do this, but I guess find somebody to make us a great for it.
**Ksipe**: Or you just get the size of it.
**Ksipe**: That's all.
**Ksipe**: Them things are standard size.
**Ksipe**: Is it 3 inch wide?
**Ksipe**: Is it a half inch thick or 1 inch thick?
**Ksipe**: But I mean just find out what it is.
**Ksipe**: Nick can look to order one.
**Ksipe**: And then if it's broke existing or if we broke it like at this point, who knows?
**Ksipe**: Because we didn't even know they're was one there.
**Ksipe**: Yeah, just get the dimensions of it, send it to Nick.
**Ksipe**: They're standard.
**Ksipe**: They'll have them laying around the warehouse.
**Jdawson**: 10, 4.
**Jcurtin**: So are they forming the footings today and inspecting tomorrow?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I have an inspection scheduled for tomorrow at 9am.
**Ksipe**: But if there's some of the great.
**Ksipe**: You just cut a piece of plywood to fill in the section that doesn't have a grate.
**Ksipe**: Then you wrap that grate with the mirror fi.
**Ksipe**: And then it acts as the same filtration and makes it so it drains as the others.
**Jdawson**: Okay, step four.
**Jdawson**: Good.
**Ksipe**: Get them footings poured.
**Ksipe**: Get the block done.
**Ksipe**: You're out of the woods.
**Ksipe**: Lock that thing up.
**Ksipe**: Get the equipment.
**Jcurtin**: Make sure they.
**Jcurtin**: They form them at the correct height.
**Jcurtin**: And I know you were checking the location.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Ksipe**: And they're forming it so it bumps out whatever it is.
**Ksipe**: Six or eight inches.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: They.
**Jdawson**: They tried to rebuttal on that yesterday, but I just told them like it's too late to be making recommendations and adjustments.
**Jdawson**: You got to follow the plan.
**Jdawson**: Basically, Rick was saying that that concrete wall there he was Saying normally when he does them, it's flush with the block on the left and the right, and there's usually no block behind his concrete wall.
**Jdawson**: And then Rock Solid was standing there, and he was like, yeah, same here.
**Jdawson**: He was like, normally I just butt it up to the concrete, and then instead of having a bump out, and then they were like, show us pictures.
**Ksipe**: Of the existing dock and the equipment we're putting back in.
**Ksipe**: That's how it was built before, and that's how it's going to be built now.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, for sure.
**Jdawson**: And that's what I reiterated to them.
**Ksipe**: So they're.
**Jdawson**: They're now to follow that plan.
**Jcurtin**: Are they?
**Jcurtin**: Okay, as far as the Dalla locations?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jdawson**: Rock Solid.
**Jdawson**: David from Rock Solid came out, and him.
**Jdawson**: Me and Rick were all standing there, and him and Rick were going back and forth and got on the same page of the Owl locations.
**Jcurtin**: Okay, Are you.
**Jcurtin**: You guys pouring on Monday, then?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that's what it looks like right now.
**Jdawson**: It's like Monday evening.
**Jcurtin**: The concrete testing agency lined up?
**Jdawson**: No, I'll call them and talk to them and get that lined up.
**Jdawson**: I'll get an exact time from Rick today of when that pour is, so then I can accurately schedule that.
**Ksipe**: When is the surveyor coming?
**Jdawson**: Or that back area.
**Ksipe**: Yeah, the drive needed laid out.
**Jdawson**: Reach out for the.
**Jdawson**: For the dock door.
**Ksipe**: Oh, the surveyor for the alley in the back.
**Jdawson**: Oh, oh, oh.
**Jdawson**: I don't have him scheduled yet because Rick isn't starting that this week.
**Jdawson**: But I was telling you, schedule it.
**Ksipe**: It's staking it out.
**Ksipe**: Take pictures of it.
**Ksipe**: Say the stakes are in.
**Ksipe**: Send them to whatever his name is, and say, this staked out, ready to go.
**Ksipe**: When are you guys getting here?
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Ksipe**: It'll get forgotten, and then it'll show up and say, now I can't do it because it's not staked out.
**Jdawson**: Amen.
**Jdawson**: No, yeah, you're absolutely right.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: So I'll get that scheduled today, too.
**Jdawson**: My bad.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we talked about that yesterday.
**Jdawson**: Another thing that they're working on right now is forming up the sidewalks and stuff.
**Jdawson**: They pulled some string yesterday for that and reminded him about pouring the sidewalk up front tomorrow along with the footings.
**Ksipe**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: Are you able to talk to him today?
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, you can call me.
**Jcurtin**: When to look at the canopy, the asphalt there.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Down low at the bottom.
**Ksipe**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: And then so.
**Jdawson**: So I know originally we talked about just, like, a concrete column base, maybe about, like six inches.
**Jdawson**: Six inches high, depending on now that this note we've seen that says confirm contrast base Material with tenant and landlord.
**Jdawson**: I'm worried that it depending on like us one still accomplishing covering the footing and correctly tying in the pavement and making it look all nice and pretty, but also accomplishing what Goodwill's expectations are.
**Jdawson**: On that note right there about confirm contrast base material with tenant and landlord.
**Jdawson**: If there's something specific that they want.
**Jdawson**: If not, then it would just be like a column, like a concrete cube at the bottom.
**Jdawson**: And he's going to grout it of course underneath this.
**Jdawson**: Underneath the.
**Jdawson**: Underneath the steel like contracted to and then do a concrete cube at the bottom and then the rest of it to then be just wrapped with EFIs from bottom to top.
**Jdawson**: But if there's something that Goodwill is expecting as a base material, whether they want to do some sort of like.
**Jdawson**: If they had like some sort of brick design that they normally do on these canopies.
**Ksipe**: This is all framed in APHIS columns.
**Ksipe**: I don't know where she came up with that right now.
**Ksipe**: I'll check it.
**Ksipe**: If it's a different color ethis fine.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Ksipe**: But there's ballers to protect it.
**Ksipe**: I don't need that down there.
**Ksipe**: And there is no alternate material.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Damn.
**Jdawson**: 4.
**Jdawson**: Well then I'll continue on with talking with Rick about this today.
**Jdawson**: He was on the excavator a lot yesterday.
**Jdawson**: We're going to continue to talk about this today and lock in on a plan detail and.
**Jdawson**: And then from.
**Jdawson**: From his cube concrete at the bottom, it's just going to be es all the way up wrapped to the structural steel.
**Jcurtin**: I. I missed that last part.
**Jcurtin**: You said it's going to all be eepis, Tracy.
**Ksipe**: Yeah, it just needs to be an epis column.
**Ksipe**: That's all we ever figured was framing eepis.
**Ksipe**: The base plate needs to be make sure they grout that.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Ksipe**: It'S the non shrink grout.
**Ksipe**: They fill in under the base plate and then cover all them bolts with concrete.
**Ksipe**: But just get something sent to me so I can take a look at what you're planning on doing.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: And Jack, don't bring up that note to the EFIS guy.
**Jcurtin**: Just when they're in the field.
**Jcurtin**: Just have them e fish to the bottom.
**Jdawson**: Okay, well you.
**Jcurtin**: Because otherwise they're gonna ask for a change order if you show them that note.
**Jdawson**: Who.
**Jdawson**: What are you.
**Jdawson**: What are you saying?
**Jcurtin**: If we don't bring that note up, confirm contrast base material with tenant and landlord.
**Jcurtin**: If we don't bring that up to the EFIS guy, then he's probably won't ask for a change order.
**Jcurtin**: But if we do show it to him, then he's going to ask us for a change order.
**Jdawson**: I don't care.
**Ksipe**: At this point, I don't know how we get through these drawings.
**Ksipe**: Like, why are we looking at this today and figuring out that that's what we have to build?
**Ksipe**: It doesn't make any sense.
**Jcurtin**: I did.
**Jcurtin**: I didn't ever notice that note.
**Jcurtin**: I just contracted him, and in his contract, it says EFIS on the columns, but I didn't notice that note right there.
**Ksipe**: Well, we just have to do a better job, like our jobs, to know the plans better than anyone.
**Ksipe**: When we see discrepancies and things like that, we just need to get them knocked out.
**Ksipe**: We could have had Emily take this off of the plan a month ago or did AN or internal RFI and said, no, these are just EFIs, and we'd have been done and move on now.
**Ksipe**: You know, that's what I'm saying.
**Ksipe**: We got a month left to get the job finished, and we just don't have time to figure things out and, you know, keep bleeding money here and there with these little things, so.
**Ksipe**: But, you know, encourage you guys to go, you know, you should just go through everything, Jack.
**Ksipe**: You're looking at the drawings every day.
**Ksipe**: You should be looking through all these things.
**Ksipe**: You got to finish and build out and make sure it's bought out or it's.
**Ksipe**: Maybe it's right or wrong.
**Ksipe**: That's the only way to be efficient on a job.
**Jdawson**: Amen.
**Ksipe**: Sam.
**Jcurtin**: All right.
**Jcurtin**: Is that it?
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: As far as things that I had to review or go over.
**Jcurtin**: All right, I'll talk to you guys later.
**Ksipe**: All right, see you.
**Jdawson**: All right, thanks, y'.
**Jdawson**: All.
**Ksipe**: Sam.
