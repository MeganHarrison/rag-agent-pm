## Transcript
**Housh**: Hey.
**Housh**: Whoosh.
**Speaker 1**: Hi, Jesse.
**Speaker 1**: How are you?
**Housh**: Good, good.
**Housh**: Share my screen here.
**Housh**: So, like, these guys are super helpful and it's funny.
**Speaker 1**: I mean, north side.
**Housh**: Well, north side, you guys are very helpful.
**Housh**: But the city guys down there, you know, they're like, well, first turn off Fireflies because we're going to talk about stuff and we don't want it, you know, out there to people to critique, you know, so.
**Housh**: So anyways, looking at it, I told them, you know, how you said we probably need at least an acre of storm retention pond.
**Housh**: So this road used to come through here and that's what's still shown on this drawing.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Housh**: But.
**Housh**: But this went away and they turned it into this curve.
**Housh**: So they're going to check with the county and see if we can have this property here to put the retention pond on.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: That'd be great if they can.
**Housh**: And then this road will never get built.
**Housh**: So we can add an access road here that goes through here and connects to this road and then just build one bridge or two or whatever across this drainage canal.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Housh**: To get into the parking lot and out.
**Housh**: And then people also can drive in.
**Housh**: We can do like a, like a turn, like a, a cell lane type thing for them to just pull in, drop their people off and then go park.
**Speaker 1**: I see.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Housh**: But they love to having the dimension plan, so that's all good.
**Speaker 1**: Those just real quick looking at, if you blow that up a little bit more.
**Speaker 1**: Just, just what you had, those two orange areas that you are showing as the cul de sac, as the.
**Speaker 1**: Some sort of a bridge over the thing.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: If you look, you have two main roads going down that have no parking lot associated with that.
**Speaker 1**: So I would shift those is what I'm.
**Speaker 1**: I'm saying.
**Speaker 1**: I would shift them to line it up with those two roadways.
**Housh**: Well, this here is all just BS really.
**Housh**: Like we would want you to.
**Housh**: To design a functioning parking lot.
**Speaker 1**: I see.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Housh**: This, this was just something our guy did to show a parking.
**Housh**: You know, I just said show the same amount of parking spaces.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Housh**: So like this could be a lot more efficient if it's 2 acres.
**Housh**: Like I don't know how many cars you can typically get into 2 acre parking lot.
**Housh**: But we'll just want to maximize the parking here.
**Speaker 1**: All right.
**Housh**: Especially if we get this.
**Housh**: Like this has to be over an acre.
**Housh**: I would think of area here or close to it.
**Housh**: And he said we just have to keep like the 30 foot right away off the side of the road.
**Speaker 1**: I'm just wondering also if There are any utilities in that old drive.
**Housh**: You know, there's overhead power lines running through there somewhere.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: And underground, possibly water force main.
**Speaker 1**: You know, we have to relocate or whatever.
**Housh**: Yeah.
**Housh**: That I don't know about, but there's nothing really developed out in this area, so I can't imagine what would be in there.
**Housh**: So they're going to get back to us on whether we can use this or not, and then this thing will start rolling.
**Speaker 1**: Awesome.
**Housh**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Once you give me the green light, I'll meet you out there.
**Speaker 1**: I'll just get in my car within the next.
**Speaker 1**: It takes me an hour and a half, two hours, let's say, to get there.
**Housh**: Yeah, I'll.
**Speaker 1**: I'll be there in two hours.
**Housh**: All right.
**Housh**: Heck yeah.
**Housh**: So that's good.
**Housh**: I'm gonna meet Brian for dinner this evening.
**Housh**: I think he said something about looking at a site, so I have to go see what he maybe finally get something to.
**Housh**: To build for us.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: He has given us a.
**Speaker 1**: Some sort of a drawing.
**Speaker 1**: So Sandy's looking that up to see what we can build there.
**Housh**: Okay.
**Housh**: Awesome.
**Housh**: That would be awesome.
**Housh**: Where is it at?
**Housh**: I didn't ask him any details on it.
**Speaker 1**: It's in Bel Air area.
**Speaker 1**: Bel Air.
**Housh**: Oh, cool.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, he lives nearby there.
**Speaker 1**: And there's a canal that's going along the side of the lot.
**Speaker 1**: And I'm also having a feeling that it may be in flood zone, so we're gonna have to look at all that stuff.
**Housh**: Okay.
**Housh**: Bel Air is a nice area.
**Speaker 1**: It is.
**Housh**: It is cool.
**Housh**: Yeah, we got that.
**Housh**: You know, like, did you read that email from the Indianapolis.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Housh**: Understand, like, what are they doing?
**Speaker 1**: My God, this is just two little driveways.
**Speaker 1**: Can you imagine that?
**Speaker 1**: We're reducing one to just out only.
**Housh**: Well, then what.
**Housh**: What were they talking about?
**Housh**: The fence?
**Housh**: Like, the fence is simply because it's a private parking lot and it's only for their employees.
**Housh**: Like, I don't understand why they're making like.
**Housh**: That seemed like a big deal in our email.
**Speaker 1**: Well, I don't know if you've noticed this lately, but there are a lot of younger generation and maybe some that are not quite seasoned.
**Speaker 1**: So, you know, I.
**Speaker 1**: I've noticed it in a lot of cities lately.
**Speaker 1**: We have to explain a lot more.
**Housh**: Yeah, well, that's a.
**Housh**: It's kind of sad.
**Housh**: Like with when inflation was going through the roof.
**Housh**: Remember how like all the people were leaving the building department to take higher paying jobs?
**Speaker 1**: Yes.
**Housh**: And I mean, it just cleaned them out of all their people that had experience.
**Speaker 1**: The drop program.
**Speaker 1**: They got rid of all the seasoned older people.
**Speaker 1**: They retired them.
**Speaker 1**: Now we have to deal with, you know, people that are learning.
**Housh**: Yeah.
**Housh**: Well, so on that though, do you like.
**Housh**: And I just wanted to talk to you and I.
**Housh**: That's why I didn't know if we need to get Goodwill's attorney honestly involved because sometimes they'll get to the city like, what are you doing?
**Housh**: You know, this, you know, if that's something that would help, I don't know what you think.
**Speaker 1**: Let me, let me thoroughly read that email.
**Speaker 1**: I'll copy certainly you on it and respond to.
**Speaker 1**: So she basically had said originally in the beginning, she says you may even need a right away permit.
**Speaker 1**: But, but let us, you know, and then as she goes on, she says, well, you may not need a right of way permit.
**Speaker 1**: Let's see if the driveway people approve it.
**Housh**: But didn't we, what was the permit we applied for?
**Housh**: We got it.
**Housh**: And then they were like, no, no, that's not the permit you need.
**Housh**: You need this permit.
**Housh**: And then that's the one we just submitted for.
**Housh**: And now she's going back.
**Housh**: Is she telling us we to apply for the permit?
**Housh**: We already hold.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, give me, give me, give me about 10 minutes.
**Speaker 1**: Let me, let me read it more in depth.
**Speaker 1**: I kind of curse, you know, kind of reviewed it real quick.
**Speaker 1**: So let me read it more in depth and I can call you back on that.
**Housh**: Okay, perfect.
**Speaker 1**: Yes.
**Housh**: All right, thanks.
**Speaker 1**: All right, awesome, thanks, bye.
