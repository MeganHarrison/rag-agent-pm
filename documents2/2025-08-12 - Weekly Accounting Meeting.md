**Accounting**: Hi guys.
**Aortiz**: Did we get documents set for this meeting?
**Accounting**: No, we didn't.
**Accounting**: I asked for documents but they weren't sent to me.
**Accounting**: So I don't think the guys have something.
**Aortiz**: Jose, Fatima, why don't we have documents present?
**Jdawson**: Well, in my case the only thing that I need to update is the credit card transaction and Well, I. I just sent an email because.
**Jdawson**: Just stating that all the transactions are uploaded and posted in the community.
**Aortiz**: The 66, they're in Jesse.
**Aortiz**: Nice court.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jdawson**: But I will wait for his help and then we will complete the transaction.
**Jdawson**: But there is nothing pending for coding and that is the item.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Aortiz**: When you say like for instance that we have 66 items for Jesse and I to approve that have Been coded?
**Aortiz**: Have the other thousand transactions that we've already approved in this latest pay cycle already been synced and uploaded to Acumatica or are you waiting on that remaining 66 before you upload?
**Jdawson**: I mean, that is the only open item in notion to be uploading Akumatica.
**Jdawson**: All the other ones are uploaded yet.
**Jdawson**: Encoding and all the process completed.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Aortiz**: All right, so what I think you said was that all the other transactions besides those 66 that you sent us have been synced with Acumatica.
**Jdawson**: Yes, that's right.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right, good.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Aortiz**: Now have you gone, you know, when did you sync those?
**Bclymer**: Oh.
**Jdawson**: Yesterday.
**Jdawson**: And I confirmed today.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Because I needed to review, but I completed yesterday.
**Aortiz**: Okay, so you, you, have you already gone into job planner and spot checked the budgets to make sure it's hitting the right way?
**Jdawson**: Yes, that confirmation.
**Jdawson**: I did it today.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Aortiz**: Okay, good deal.
**Aortiz**: And any issues?
**Jdawson**: No, no at all.
**Aortiz**: Okay, all right, it's good.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Aortiz**: What about, you know, who's handling AR and AP aging, you know, those reports.
**Jmendez**: Cash flow.
**Aortiz**: You can't update the cash flow today.
**Bclymer**: That what you're saying?
**Jmendez**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: What the.
**Aortiz**: Moves my goddamn mind.
**Aortiz**: And so this 4.3 million, or I guess this 6.8 million is now inclusive of that invoice 002 for applause.
**Aortiz**: You're muted.
**Jmendez**: Oh, sorry.
**Jmendez**: Yeah.
**Jmendez**: Yes, that's included.
**Aortiz**: Okay.
**Aortiz**: And so the payroll here that you have is 82,000, but I'm pretty sure I saw a note come through from the payroll company about payroll beings right here.
**Aortiz**: That's not it.
**Aortiz**: 70 something.
**Aortiz**: Is that right, Maria?
**Accounting**: Yes, correct.
**Jmendez**: Yes, correct.
**Aortiz**: Okay, so, yeah, make sure, yeah, so make sure as you're, you know, doing that right.
**Aortiz**: As you're doing this, that, that we're accurate.
**Aortiz**: You know, we, I, you know, again, if you're like, we, we know that what the amount's going to be, it's 72 and some change, you know, that's a $10,000 difference.
**Aortiz**: So we want to make sure that's right.
**Aortiz**: And then I don't know if that Capital One balances on balances, is that accurate?
**Aortiz**: Is that current as of today?
**Jmendez**: I.
**Jmendez**: Based upon.
**Jmendez**: On that today.
**Aortiz**: Okay, so then, so, so if you're going to come in here and update the cash flow statement to where it's.
**Aortiz**: It's as of today.
**Aortiz**: Right.
**Aortiz**: Which is what you're doing, then we need to make sure that everything in there is.
**Aortiz**: Does that make sense?
**Jmendez**: Update the payroll?
**Jmendez**: Yes.
**Aortiz**: Yeah, so, so it's again, that's just those two numbers, right?
**Aortiz**: Because like maybe our capital one is 60 some odd thousand now, you know, and, and it's 72 on the payroll.
**Aortiz**: So just if you're going to come in and say, hey, this is current and up to date, then let's make sure it's current and up to date.
**Jmendez**: Okay.
**Aortiz**: Is that bank balance 1.7, is that accurate?
**Jmendez**: Yes, if you can see.
**Jmendez**: I have the screenshot of the.
**Aortiz**: Okay, so, yeah, so, all right, so then we've got, you know, after all these checks and everything, we've got $95,000 left in our account, which obviously will change because Payroll is not 82, it's a little less.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Accounting**: Financial law reviews, current budget status and outstanding voices and receivables.
**Fnjie**: Financial reviews.
**Fnjie**: I had a WIP review with, with Jesse yesterday to review a lot of these projects and budgets.
**Fnjie**: I have some updates to make and I'll review the updated one with him sometime today if you're available, Jesse.
**Fnjie**: But yeah, we should have June financials wrapped up by Friday.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Accounting**: Nothing for outstanding invoices and receivables, quarterly closing updates, issues or delays in anything.
**Accounting**: Insurance updates, payment everything.
**Accounting**: Good with Lisa?
**Accounting**: Are we waiting on something on that side?
**Fnjie**: Did you talk to her yesterday, Brandon, about that workers comp.
**Aortiz**: I mean, just the emails you saw about me throwing a fit.
**Aortiz**: Yeah, I mean, you know, she.
**Aortiz**: I mean, it is what it is, right?
**Aortiz**: Like we gotta have it, pay it, you know, but you know, I just, you know, I.
**Aortiz**: One of the things is I, I gotta figure out because walking onto a job site and being coded as a carpenter and paying out the wazoo is ridiculous.
**Fnjie**: Yeah, that's almost, you know, like double first invoice, which was 10.
**Fnjie**: 10 grand.
**Fnjie**: Now it's an additional 16.
**Aortiz**: Well, and it's not even the whole.
**Aortiz**: It's only six guys.
**Fnjie**: Oh, wow, 26,000.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, that.
**Aortiz**: That $16,000 is only for people that are being coded as carpenters, which is, you know, that's Chad Candon, Jack, Mike, Alex.
**Aortiz**: Five.
**Bclymer**: Wow.
**Aortiz**: Unbelievable.
**Aortiz**: There's no.
**Aortiz**: So anyway, we have to find, you know, maybe we got to go through Venture or something because I know they have, you know, work comp options.
**Aortiz**: I don't understand.
**Aortiz**: There's got to be somebody out.
**Aortiz**: I mean construction, like design build firms like ours or even just a construction management firm.
**Aortiz**: You wouldn't be able to say in business if you had 50 superintendents.
**Aortiz**: You paying a million dollars in workers comp.
**Aortiz**: Like that's.
**Aortiz**: It'd be ridiculous.
**Aortiz**: Yeah, and that's, and that's with us fudging the numbers.
**Aortiz**: Because by her definition, literally everybody in the company, minus a few would be have to be a carpenter.
**Aortiz**: Because I walk on site and she said if you walk on site, you're a carpenter.
**Accounting**: Well, we can check with Venture like you said.
**Fnjie**: Yeah, I think so too.
**Fnjie**: Because that is a lot.
**Accounting**: Yeah, that's extreme.
**Accounting**: I'll check something.
**Accounting**: Brandon, Alaska.
**Accounting**: Donnie, that option.
**Accounting**: Just to have an option.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Accounting**: Okay, so we need to talk about that.
**Accounting**: Accountables, payable and receivable.
**Accounting**: Review of pending payments, vendor issues or concerns, client billing updates.
**Accounting**: Something on that matters.
**Fnjie**: So Fritzi, did you send Maria the updated list for this week?
**Jmendez**: Sorry?
**Jmendez**: For the.
**Fnjie**: The villains.
**Fnjie**: The list we looked at last week that had all the progress billings and what's due.
**Fnjie**: Did you update it this week?
**Jmendez**: Yes, I. I'll just save it in the cash flow.
**Jmendez**: Maybe there's a portion there for the AP aging.
**Accounting**: Okay, but is it something that we need to do about that list or anything, Fatima or.
**Fnjie**: No, we just need to look at it.
**Accounting**: Okay, so once you have it, for instance.
**Accounting**: I can share it.
**Accounting**: I can share.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Accounting**: Now, payroll and compliance updates the status of payroll processing tax or regulatory changes.
**Accounting**: How is payroll doing?
**Jdawson**: Yes, yes, sorry, go ahead.
**Aortiz**: Go ahead.
**Jdawson**: Jose, I know that you were saying that all is processed, but the payroll we have pending to process is pay date August 1st.
**Jdawson**: But yeah, waiting for the timesheet update.
**Jdawson**: And then we.
**Jdawson**: We will prepare the allocation for August 1st, August 1st pay date.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Aortiz**: Okay, send us.
**Aortiz**: Send Jesse and I a note please on who has not filled out their timesheets so we can get on them.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, maybe Fitzi can help us to.
**Jdawson**: Because I guess she has the control of this.
**Jmendez**: I have already follow up them.
**Jmendez**: Some of them have already updated.
**Jmendez**: I was also waiting for the per diem data so that I can send it Maria as well.
**Accounting**: Yes, we need to send payroll today so I can reapprove.
**Accounting**: So once you have that in place, if you can keep nudging the people, all the guys.
**Accounting**: Because I know usually Jack and Mike have their per diems, but we need the timesheets as well so they can be added there.
**Accounting**: Okay, we need to send that today for approval.
**Fnjie**: And Jose, remember the August 1st pay date we post in July, because that's for July time.
**Jdawson**: Okay, that's good.
**Accounting**: Okay, good.
**Accounting**: On that side, for payroll Akumatica, any pending transactions issues or delays there.
**Aortiz**: Do we have any issues with sub jobs?
**Fnjie**: Not that I'm aware of.
**Jmendez**: Percy, I have question with 25118 Radial Brownsburg.
**Jmendez**: We have this invoice created.
**Jmendez**: The period is.
**Jmendez**: I think 7:31 to 8:31.
**Jmendez**: What month am I going to post it?
**Jmendez**: Or what month are we going to.
**Jmendez**: What period are we going to post it?
**Jmendez**: Is it July or August?
**Aortiz**: Is this an invoice that we sent to a client or is this an invoice that we receive?
**Aortiz**: So is accounts receivable or accounts payable?
**Jmendez**: It's owner's.
**Jmendez**: Owner's billing.
**Aortiz**: Accounts receivable.
**Jmendez**: Yes.
**Aortiz**: If the billing is in July, we post it in July, you know, at the end of the month.
**Aortiz**: And so as far as AR agent goes, 30 days.
**Aortiz**: So it's due at the end of August.
**Jmendez**: Yeah, but I think the period created is 7:31.
**Jmendez**: Start date is 7:31, and then end date is 8:31.
**Speaker 6**: Yeah, but all that work's been completed.
**Aortiz**: Yeah, that's just where.
**Aortiz**: That's just where A.J.
**Aortiz**: messed up.
**Jmendez**: Oh, okay.
**Aortiz**: But he just didn't.
**Aortiz**: He just didn't bill until August, you know, which is what he's not supposed to do.
**Aortiz**: And he didn't go up there and change the billing period to July.
**Aortiz**: But it's.
**Aortiz**: It's July.
**Aortiz**: Put the last day of July is the billing date and, you know, 30 days from there.
**Jmendez**: Okay, so we need to enter this in Chromatica in July, right?
**Aortiz**: Correct.
**Jmendez**: Okay, I'll do.
**Jdawson**: And something additional maybe can help us to create Jesse's remillard coast code.
**Jdawson**: Because not all the project has his coast code yet created.
**Aortiz**: The senior project manager.
**Aortiz**: So.
**Jdawson**: Yes, yes, senior project manager, you should.
**Aortiz**: Whenever you enter that in Acumatica and it pushes back to job planner, it should automatically just go in and it'll add an expense and create a code.
**Aortiz**: You know, just because it wasn't budgeted doesn't mean, like, it should still kick a code out.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Aortiz**: If you're getting an error, the only thing that it could.
**Aortiz**: I would think it could be is for some reason, if that job and job planner doesn't have that cost code added, then you just got to go into the cost codes and add it.
**Aortiz**: But it should.
**Aortiz**: They should all have them.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I will take it.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Accounting**: In notion, how are the credit card transactions?
**Accounting**: You said they were clear today, right, Jose?
**Accounting**: Like, there's no pending.
**Aortiz**: There's 66 that are in Jesse Nice court that we have to approve.
**Accounting**: Okay, calendar, how is the calendar looking there in notion for you guys?
**Accounting**: Working everything?
**Aortiz**: Yeah, the biggest thing with that calendar is, you know, if these guys need to be hitting it.
**Aortiz**: So, like, you know, sending out due dates, reminders, hey, I need this.
**Aortiz**: Blah, blah, blah.
**Speaker 6**: You say there's 66 in here.
**Speaker 6**: Like, I approved all the ones that I seen yesterday.
**Speaker 6**: I don't see any in here for me to approve.
**Bclymer**: I'll.
**Aortiz**: I'll go over there and show you.
**Aortiz**: Jesse, you're probably looking at the wrong screen.
**Speaker 6**: Leadership dashboard.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Aortiz**: Credit card transactions to approve, and then you click coded and there's a handful of them there.
**Speaker 6**: There they are.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Accounting**: Okay, perfect.
**Accounting**: So go do that.
**Accounting**: And then.
**Accounting**: Yeah, for the calendar, we need to make sure everybody's doing that on time, especially the timesheets.
**Accounting**: Those are already added to the Outlook calendar.
**Accounting**: But if we need to keep nudging them, we have to on timesheets where it will, you know, waiting on the timesheets, but we need them today, the latest, because we need to send that as well for payroll.
**Accounting**: And then anything else you guys need specifically to Brandon or to Jesse, Fatima, Fritzi or Jose.
**Accounting**: Specific signature check ins.
**Jmendez**: Sorry.
**Jmendez**: I sent to Jesse the Lean waiver for Uniqlo, the updated one.
**Jmendez**: Unconditional and unconditional.
**Speaker 6**: Yeah, I just.
**Speaker 6**: I saw those.
**Speaker 6**: I'll sign them and send them back.
**Speaker 6**: So, like, are we not doing it for the other jobs or is that the only one?
**Speaker 6**: We're turning these in.
**Speaker 6**: Those are the only ones I've seen this month.
**Aortiz**: You should be doing them for doing them all.
**Aortiz**: I was on AJ's ass about it and.
**Aortiz**: But yes, this should all be getting done.
**Aortiz**: I just can't babysit enough.
**Speaker 6**: Yeah, well, I mean, just for all the guys, like.
**Speaker 6**: Like, who in accounting is it you, Fritzi?
**Speaker 6**: Are you going to get on all the PMs about doing that?
**Speaker 6**: Or they simply send you the bill to do, and then you send me the lien.
**Aortiz**: Waivers mean it should be they send the bill like, you know, or they should request a lien waiver for XYZ amount for a project, and then that way they review it, make sure it's, you know, correct, and then, you know, you.
**Aortiz**: You or I or whoever can sign it.
**Speaker 6**: So I guess my question.
**Speaker 6**: I don't recall seeing any others.
**Speaker 6**: Or did you sign all the other ones?
**Aortiz**: No, I haven't.
**Aortiz**: It's not been getting done.
**Jmendez**: Okay, so should it be a procedure that every time there's an invoice that has been created or it has been sent to a customer, I should prepare a lien waiver for that, Correct?
**Aortiz**: Yes.
**Aortiz**: Anytime that a subcontractor is requesting to get payment, we should have a lien waiver, and then we should have unconditional when they get paid.
**Aortiz**: And it's the exact same process when we are Billing a client.
**Aortiz**: When we bill a client, we should be sending a conditional lien waiver that says on condition of being paid, we will waive our lien rights.
**Aortiz**: And then the next app we'll have an unconditional saying, hey, you've paid us.
**Aortiz**: We are, you know, unconditional lien waiver.
**Bclymer**: Here's your copy.
**Jmendez**: Okay, we'll do that.
**Fnjie**: I do have a question on job 25.
**Fnjie**: 120 GPC high robotic.
**Fnjie**: We don't have a.
**Fnjie**: We don't have a budget for that one yet in Acumatica.
**Fnjie**: Right?
**Speaker 6**: We have the budget in job planner.
**Fnjie**: So yes, job planner.
**Fnjie**: That's what I meant to say.
**Speaker 6**: Yeah, it's in there.
**Fnjie**: 25 1.
**Aortiz**: It just needs.
**Aortiz**: It probably is.
**Aortiz**: Hold on, I'm looking at it.
**Aortiz**: It's in there and it said the project is synced.
**Aortiz**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: The contract.
**Fnjie**: The contract information is blank.
**Fnjie**: I meant to say the contract, not a budget.
**Speaker 6**: Oh, that's the one.
**Speaker 6**: We need that contact info for the owner.
**Aortiz**: Yeah, we need the W9 info.
**Aortiz**: Did they not send that yet?
**Fnjie**: No, I haven't seen anything.
**Aortiz**: Okay, so follow up on with that.
**Aortiz**: Fritzi or Jose?
**Aortiz**: I don't know who was Jose?
**Aortiz**: I don't know who is working on that, but follow up.
**Jmendez**: I'm sorry, what project is that again?
**Aortiz**: GPC Harrisburg.
**Aortiz**: The high tech one.
**Jmendez**: GPC they have already sent.
**Jmendez**: I have also created the customer for that.
**Aortiz**: Okay, so make sure when you create a customer in Acumatica, you have to create the customer and then you also have to click the box that says extend to vendor.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Speaker 6**: So can you forward that info to us so we can get the owner set up in job plan or does that automatically do it?
**Aortiz**: So you got to go into like the erp, you got to go to vendors and then you would, you know, refresh and say ready to import.
**Aortiz**: And so whatever that, you know, company name is, you know, so is it, you know, it's just.
**Aortiz**: I don't know if it's gpc.
**Aortiz**: You know, it doesn't look like that.
**Aortiz**: So maybe it's general parts.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I don't know.
**Aortiz**: It's not showing.
**Aortiz**: So unless you've extended it as a vendor.
**Aortiz**: But like, you know, you extended as a vendor.
**Aortiz**: And then you, you'll go and you'll import it in there, you know, again based off whatever the, you know, the legal entity name is.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Aortiz**: So whenever you get it extended to Ventor Fritzi, let us know and then tell us what the legal name is.
**Aortiz**: Right, so it's general parts or GPC or blah blah blah.
**Jmendez**: Whatever it is, it's Napa Auto Parts.
**Aortiz**: Napa is the legal name.
**Jmendez**: Where is that option?
**Jmendez**: Extend to vendor.
**Aortiz**: Share your screen.
**Jmendez**: Okay, so I'm here.
**Aortiz**: All right, so go.
**Aortiz**: Go over to the left and click.
**Aortiz**: So click receive.
**Aortiz**: Okay, so go.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Aortiz**: Okay, you see customers.
**Aortiz**: Okay, so click the three dots.
**Aortiz**: Three dots.
**Aortiz**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Aortiz**: Extend as vendor.
**Aortiz**: See there, second one down.
**Aortiz**: Customer management.
**Bclymer**: There you go.
**Aortiz**: And then it'll pull all the information.
**Aortiz**: Boom.
**Aortiz**: And you'll save.
**Bclymer**: Yep, you had it.
**Aortiz**: No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
**Bclymer**: Go back, go back.
**Aortiz**: Go back.
**Aortiz**: You had the vendor class, correct?
**Bclymer**: It was.
**Aortiz**: It was written as a customer.
**Jmendez**: Should I delete this?
**Aortiz**: So just cancel and do it again.
**Jmendez**: Okay, sorry.
**Aortiz**: So hit your three dots.
**Aortiz**: Extend as vendor.
**Aortiz**: Okay, now it.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: Boom.
**Aortiz**: Okay, now your vendor class.
**Bclymer**: So click.
**Aortiz**: Click that and then see Customer select.
**Aortiz**: Customer select.
**Bclymer**: Yep, there you go.
**Bclymer**: Boom.
**Bclymer**: Yep, there you go.
**Bclymer**: And then.
**Fnjie**: So what does.
**Fnjie**: So what does this.
**Fnjie**: This do?
**Fnjie**: This allows it to go into Job Planner.
**Aortiz**: Yeah.
**Aortiz**: So Job Planner or Pro Board do not delineate between a customer and a vendor.
**Aortiz**: Right?
**Aortiz**: They just see one thing.
**Aortiz**: And so on our end on acumatica, we delineate the two, right?
**Aortiz**: We have a customer.
**Aortiz**: And so you extend it as vendor.
**Aortiz**: And then you pick their vendor class as that customer label.
**Aortiz**: And then so then now that's here.
**Aortiz**: So then you know, so the legal name is.
**Aortiz**: You know, legal name is Nava Auto Parts.
**Aortiz**: So then when I go into Job Planner, then I will go into my ERP and I will refresh from ERP and it should show up.
**Aortiz**: There it is, Napa Auto Parts.
**Aortiz**: So then I will click import, create new company.
**Aortiz**: And now it's imported.
**Aortiz**: So then in the job it should be able to go in and go to project contacts.
**Aortiz**: And so from see I think from address book.
**Aortiz**: And then I can type in Napa and should pop up right there.
**Aortiz**: Napa Auto Parts Added, selected.
**Aortiz**: So now they are added.
**Aortiz**: So now you can.
**Jmendez**: Every time I'll add a customer, I will do that.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Aortiz**: What else?
**Accounting**: Okay, something else.
**Accounting**: Guys, how are we doing on this tracking with the accounting tracking?
**Accounting**: Is this Jose putting them here or who.
**Jdawson**: No, no, it's not mine.
**Jdawson**: I haven't completed yet.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Jmendez**: I.
**Jmendez**: This cost type material.
**Jmendez**: Yeah.
**Jmendez**: That is being emailed or there is a case created that from Job Planner.
**Jmendez**: Sorry, Akomatica.
**Accounting**: And this one that is on hold.
**Accounting**: Why it's on hold.
**Jmendez**: As further.
**Jmendez**: I'm not sure if what I'm going to put in there may be closed as that is related to the sync of AR payment.
**Jmendez**: So as for their job pointer doesn't.
**Aortiz**: Have that function, I don't think.
**Bclymer**: Do they?
**Aortiz**: Right.
**Aortiz**: Job pointer doesn't have that function.
**Aortiz**: To automatically pull it, we have to manually enter payments, don't we?
**Jmendez**: Yeah.
**Jmendez**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Aortiz**: What else?
**Accounting**: Nothing else from your side, guys.
**Accounting**: I think that's it.
**Accounting**: If it's good to keep track on these things.
**Accounting**: Anything else, guys, from you to Brandon or Jesse?
**Jdawson**: No.
**Bclymer**: No.
**Accounting**: Okay, cool.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Aortiz**: Thank you.
**Accounting**: Thank you, guys.
**Aortiz**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Thank you.
**Bclymer**: Thank you there.
