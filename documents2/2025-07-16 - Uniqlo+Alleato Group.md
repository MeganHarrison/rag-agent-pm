## Transcript
**Aelkarrimy**: Hey everyone.
**Bclymer**: Looks like we're still missing a couple, so we'll give them a couple minutes.
**Jdawson**: To get in here.
**Bclymer**: Sam.
**Bclymer**: Hey, Ahmed.
**Kevin.ly**: Hey team.
**Kevin.ly**: Sorry about that.
**Kevin.ly**: I was on the wrong meeting invite.
**Mparsons**: I apologize.
**Bclymer**: I believe we have everyone here.
**Bclymer**: We can get started.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Just go ahead and jump into the job site updates.
**Bclymer**: The elastical teams continue their feeder run from main power distribution to He1 and they're making good progress on that.
**Bclymer**: Haven't had any issues as far as outside of the construction area.
**Bclymer**: We've had our plumbing team mobilized and they got out to the job site and marked up the floor and they're ready to start their demo.
**Jdawson**: And then.
**Bclymer**: We are expecting the exotech installation manager to arrive on site.
**Bclymer**: So that's.
**Bclymer**: That's really all I have as far as job site update.
**Bclymer**: If there's no questions, pass it off to Keba here to go into the change orders.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay, so for the change orders we only have or we have the decision on the transformers.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I think we are supposed to get a decision today and yesterday I sent out a change order for, for the permit fees.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I think that's about it.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Joe, if you guys have any updates on.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: On making decision on the transformers, you can take over.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, unfortunately I don't have great news on that as of today.
**Bryan.wagar**: I know two weeks ago we were talking about the timeline on when it possibly starts to hit for delay fees.
**Bryan.wagar**: I was hoping we can talk about that and maybe there's an extra week in there or so for us just to give everybody an update.
**Bryan.wagar**: We were supposed to have box samples sent to us by the end of last week.
**Bryan.wagar**: Early this week it turns out they had to change their design on their end a little bit and we won't have them until Monday or Tuesday of this next week.
**Bryan.wagar**: We discussed with Uniglo earlier today that a decision has to be made by the end of next week.
**Bryan.wagar**: I know we have our calls on Wednesday with them and then they have their calls with their leadership team on Thursday mornings I believe so.
**Bryan.wagar**: I believe the plan, the new plan is to have this solidified by next week.
**Bryan.wagar**: So I guess my question is if I have an answer by next Friday, are we okay with no penalties?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I'm going to have to go into the.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: To the schedule and put those numbers to timing and see.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Because if we are going with the 112 transformers, I think eight to 12 weeks of lead time.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So I'll put those numbers in and see and I'll send that information with the meeting minutes.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And also on Friday's update See where we stand.
**Aelkarrimy**: And Joe, like, you know, I don't know, delay penalties, they're not coming from us, but like all we're going to do is say, you know, our install date is going to move out one week to this day.
**Aelkarrimy**: You know how that affects the end of everything.
**Aelkarrimy**: You know, this may not affect it, but all we want is just cover ourselves.
**Aelkarrimy**: Like this isn't us.
**Aelkarrimy**: We're gonna get an extra week and that's all.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I'm with you.
**Bryan.wagar**: And, and if that is like, let's say that is the, the penalty, the penalty isn't financial.
**Bryan.wagar**: The penalty is the job.
**Bryan.wagar**: Like the power just won't be delivered for another week.
**Bryan.wagar**: I'm like, I'm more in tune for that than to incur any, any financial penalties.
**Bryan.wagar**: Because right now we're in a kind of a middle ground here of it's really nobody's fault.
**Bryan.wagar**: This is something no one's ever done.
**Bryan.wagar**: And you know, I don't want any, I don't want to do any finger pointing.
**Bryan.wagar**: If it delays the electrical part a week or two weeks or whatever, we can talk about that and I can revise our schedule.
**Bryan.wagar**: I don't think a week is going to delay the overall project or I know it won't delay the overall project by any means.
**Bryan.wagar**: We would just have to move things.
**Mparsons**: Around from our side.
**Bryan.wagar**: So if that is, you know, the worst case scenario, I'm, you know, I'm more inclined to that per se, but I was hoping.
**Bryan.wagar**: Kiva, you said you have some, some somewhere.
**Bryan.wagar**: You type these dates in and you get a little more information.
**Bryan.wagar**: Information.
**Bryan.wagar**: Can we, can we have a call tomorrow, later in the day and talk about it?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yes.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah, yeah, we can, we can set up a meeting tomorrow if that works for you.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, please do.
**Bryan.wagar**: Let's, if you, if you got something late afternoon, maybe 2 o' clock or so, I would love, I'll have a couple of my other team members on the phone as well just so we can maybe work something out.
**Bryan.wagar**: I'm also trying to run some numbers on our plan B scenario and hoping that you, you know, this change order will be enough power to cover everything else.
**Bryan.wagar**: So I might have to bring you in, Brian, on maybe later tomorrow or Friday at the latest.
**Bryan.wagar**: Just for a quick question.
**Bryan.wagar**: I don't know if, if the power drops below a certain number, if, if other, if other aspects change, but that, that's kind of where we are.
**Bryan.wagar**: We're trying to cover all basis and make the best educated guess we can right now until we can have that.
**Bschwartz**: Solution okay, no worries for my end.
**Bschwartz**: Just kind of let me know, Joe, when.
**Bschwartz**: When you need me.
**Bschwartz**: I do have a few meetings tomorrow and then Friday's mostly open for me, but otherwise I'm available whenever you need me.
**Bryan.wagar**: I appreciate it.
**Bryan.wagar**: And Brian, did you just.
**Bryan.wagar**: Did you design the sprinklers as well?
**Bschwartz**: I didn't personally design them, but Henderson did.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Bryan.wagar**: Can you get me the contact of.
**Bryan.wagar**: Since we have.
**Bryan.wagar**: Everything's in motion now and we have other people looking at the sprinkler designs and things of that nature, and they just have a couple questions.
**Bryan.wagar**: There's nothing that needs to be changed.
**Bryan.wagar**: It's just more.
**Bryan.wagar**: I want the sprinkler team and our engineering team that's going to be out there making the racks all on the same page.
**Mparsons**: And I think they just have.
**Bryan.wagar**: They were looking over the designs and.
**Mparsons**: They just have a page.
**Aelkarrimy**: Joe, like our.
**Aelkarrimy**: Our sprinkler sub actually is doing the actual drawings that they're fabricating off of.
**Aelkarrimy**: So definitely we want to get him involved in that meeting.
**Aelkarrimy**: If you have some questions about it.
**Aelkarrimy**: So that.
**Aelkarrimy**: Because we're fabbing this pipe as we speak to meet the project schedule.
**Aelkarrimy**: So if something's going to change like that could have a cost impact if it doesn't work the way it's currently laid out.
**Bryan.wagar**: No, and it should work.
**Bryan.wagar**: I think these are more just questions from our side that they just want clarification on.
**Bryan.wagar**: I don't think there's.
**Bryan.wagar**: There's nothing I've been asked about that involves any changing.
**Bryan.wagar**: I just want to have a meeting between our installation team and the sprinkler team.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah, we can do that.
**Jdawson**: When did you want to do that?
**Bryan.wagar**: Can we do that?
**Bryan.wagar**: Can we do that Friday?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay, I'll send an invite out.
**Jdawson**: Perfect.
**Bschwartz**: Perfect.
**Bryan.wagar**: And I'll.
**Bryan.wagar**: I'll.
**Bryan.wagar**: If you just send it out, I'll get my.
**Bryan.wagar**: I'll get the correct people on it that are needed.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bschwartz**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: Joseph, this is Brian Fox with Upright Systems for the Echo that Can Call.
**Mparsons**: I will be traveling on Friday if you need my assistance.
**Mparsons**: So I can chime in early in the morning, but otherwise pretty much from noon to about 6.
**Mparsons**: I would actually 11 to 6, I'll be out of pocket.
**Mparsons**: So if you need my assistance, I can.
**Mparsons**: I can chime in early in the morning or I can catch up with you early next week.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Set it up for Friday morning if that works for everyone.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And Perfect.
**Jdawson**: Perfect.
**Bschwartz**: Keba, do you have Luther Pringle's email address from our team?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I think I do yes.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bschwartz**: If not, you can just include me on that invite and I'll forward it to him.
**Bschwartz**: But he would be who, who would be sitting on that call from our fire team?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay, sounds good.
**Bclymer**: Anybody Got it?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: That's it.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Anything else.
**Aelkarrimy**: Mike, have you talked to the.
**Aelkarrimy**: Anyone about those existing outlets that are there?
**Jdawson**: No.
**Aelkarrimy**: At the electricians.
**Aelkarrimy**: They haven't chased them down yet.
**Bclymer**: Oh yes, I need.
**Bclymer**: Or I've been talking to Kevin with it.
**Bclymer**: I'm going to get a drawing marked out with exactly where those.
**Bclymer**: Where that power is coming from for each one and I'll have that out.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bryan.wagar**: Mike, quick question.
**Bryan.wagar**: I know when we talked earlier this week, there's eight bay doors on the north end.
**Bryan.wagar**: Is it would.
**Bryan.wagar**: I don't know how many deliveries you constantly have coming in and out, but if, if needed, is it possible that we can maybe when I say we, I mean exotech.
**Bryan.wagar**: Have a dedicated door just for the uprights?
**Bclymer**: For the uprights.
**Bclymer**: You mean just a dedicated dock door, like.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah.
**Bryan.wagar**: Well, we're, we're coming up with several different solutions on how we're gonna get the, get the uprights in.
**Bryan.wagar**: In the building.
**Bryan.wagar**: And worst case, and to be honest, and this is worst case scenario, but worst case scenario is we just unload them in front of a dock door and then we have to pick them up by hand one by one.
**Bryan.wagar**: But that would tie up a dock door pretty much all day long every day.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, no worries.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bryan.wagar**: I just wanted to make sure.
**Bryan.wagar**: I didn't know how many trucks you had coming in and out because we would have other trucks coming as well.
**Bryan.wagar**: But I figured eight doors should be more than enough.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, we'll have more than enough.
**Bclymer**: And the only, you know, the, the only thing we may have to coordinate is with our sprinkler deliveries, but it's not going to be nearly as often as you guys.
**Bclymer**: So I can kind of plan that around you.
**Bclymer**: You guys, deliveries when we get closer to that.
**Jdawson**: Perfect.
**Bryan.wagar**: And like I said, that's, that's worst case.
**Bryan.wagar**: I mean they've, they've done it in the past.
**Bryan.wagar**: It just means more people out there, you know, just one by one throwing them up.
**Bryan.wagar**: Not throwing them up, but putting them up there, putting them on a dolly and you know, wheeling them over to where it is slow and it's exhausting.
**Bryan.wagar**: But you know, it's.
**Bryan.wagar**: There's sometimes that's the only way to do it.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, the, the unloading situation is definitely not ideal.
**Bclymer**: But I hear you.
**Jdawson**: And.
**Cheryl.green**: Sorry, Joseph and Mike, I think you guys have to share the delivery schedule for.
**Cheryl.green**: To us and for you.
**Cheryl.green**: Each other.
**Bryan.wagar**: So you get.
**Cheryl.green**: You guys can confirm each other that.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, we'll share it with you.
**Bryan.wagar**: And Mike and I definitely going to be having probably several calls a week with each other.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: And.
**Bryan.wagar**: And then once my site supervisor gets on site, which should be next week, he'll have all this information as well.
**Bclymer**: Sounds good.
**Cheryl.green**: Okay.
**Cheryl.green**: And, and you, you guys don't have to use the ramp, right?
**Bclymer**: Well, for fire sprinkler pipe.
**Bryan.wagar**: Sorry Jen, we'd love to.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, for fire sprinkler pipe.
**Bclymer**: We won't need to.
**Bclymer**: But yeah, like Joe said, if we could.
**Jdawson**: But I understand.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Kevin.ly**: Mike, did we receive clearance from ted regarding the LE1 and TL E1 transformer?
**Kevin.ly**: Like the location, was that approved on.
**Bclymer**: The inside of the tenants fence, right?
**Jdawson**: Correct.
**Bclymer**: Ted, you hear?
**Jdawson**: Oh, oh, hey Ted.
**Bclymer**: Hey, what's going on?
**Jdawson**: Hey Ted.
**Bclymer**: He's asking about the.
**Kevin.ly**: I'll share this.
**Bclymer**: When I mentioned us having to go into the tenant space over there in the construction area, it'll be a maximum of three days with a lift, but don't have those exact dates yet.
**Bclymer**: But I did bring this up to you the other day again.
**Daisuke.mine**: They, they said they would be open to it, but they want to know when.
**Daisuke.mine**: So as soon as you got a date and time and you tell me three days, I could give.
**Daisuke.mine**: Give them that.
**Daisuke.mine**: No, they'll let me know if it's okay.
**Jdawson**: Perfect.
**Cheryl.green**: Okay Mike, when, when you can share those information to Ted.
**Kevin.ly**: The timeline.
**Kevin.ly**: Mike there.
**Kevin.ly**: When do you plan on the installation for LE1 and TL?
**Kevin.ly**: When can we receive that timeline from the electrician?
**Bclymer**: Yes, let me, let me follow up with that and I will send a message out to the team.
**Bclymer**: I just need to check with.
**Bclymer**: Check with everything we have going on.
**Bclymer**: But I'll get that out to you as soon as possible.
**Cheryl.green**: Okay, thank you.
**Cheryl.green**: And how.
**Cheryl.green**: How is it going for the power cable running work in the left side like near the powerhouse.
**Jdawson**: Is it.
**Cheryl.green**: Is it no problem?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: So what.
**Bclymer**: I sent out an email last week about the plan, but basically we're not, we're not going near the power room area until we are.
**Bclymer**: Until we can make it one shot.
**Bclymer**: So the past few days we've been just making that run along the wall and there hasn't been any issues.
**Bclymer**: They're making good progress.
**Bclymer**: And I'll make sure I'm keeping Ted up to date on exactly, you know, give him at least a couple days heads up on exactly when we'll be in that area and he'll be able to help us coordinate that.
**Cheryl.green**: Okay.
**Cheryl.green**: Ted, you got no concern on this one.
**Cheryl.green**: You're good for.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah, no concern.
**Daisuke.mine**: We're just going to coordinate as we get closer.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Cheryl.green**: Mike said that he's using like 4ft lift for running a cable.
**Cheryl.green**: And that is not area where we have a problem for.
**Daisuke.mine**: No, the area is definitely congested.
**Daisuke.mine**: But we're going to try and work clear the area that he needs for that day and he can work in it.
**Daisuke.mine**: And then as he moves on, clear the other area and move back into the area we're working.
**Cheryl.green**: Okay.
**Cheryl.green**: Okay.
**Cheryl.green**: If there's no concern.
**Cheryl.green**: Yeah, okay.
**Daisuke.mine**: Mike will know.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: Does anybody have anything else right now?
**Kevin.ly**: I think you.
**Kevin.ly**: Keva sent a change order for permit fees, right?
**Kevin.ly**: There was a small delta.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Aelkarrimy**: It was only like $500 more than our.
**Aelkarrimy**: Our allowance we had.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Kevin.ly**: So Yusuke, we'll send that over to you.
**Kevin.ly**: So that's the.
**Kevin.ly**: We had an allowance in the bid for $10,000 for the permits.
**Kevin.ly**: And it was about 10,600 around that number.
**Kevin.ly**: So there's $600 change order for that.
**Cheryl.green**: So we had those budget into in the original contract, but it exceeded a little bit.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Kevin.ly**: Just because you usually once you file the drawings, they'll give you that what your permit costs.
**Kevin.ly**: So we had an allowance of 10,000.
**Kevin.ly**: Hoping that it would be under the 10,000.
**Jdawson**: But it was a little bit.
**Kevin.ly**: All right, so I'll send that over to you.
**Jdawson**: Yusuke.
**Cheryl.green**: Yeah, I received from Kebab about that.
**Jdawson**: Oh, okay.
**Cheryl.green**: But just for five or 600, right?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Cheryl.green**: Is it possible to include into the original just for 5 or 6?
**Aelkarrimy**: Do what?
**Cheryl.green**: Just include it into the original contract.
**Cheryl.green**: Give us a favor for just 500.
**Mparsons**: 600.
**Aelkarrimy**: Well, we're trying to do you a favor on some electrical.
**Aelkarrimy**: So let me see how that works out with.
**Aelkarrimy**: Mike's going to investigate a little bit.
**Aelkarrimy**: Some existing outlets.
**Aelkarrimy**: Maybe we can reuse them and save happen to run new ones.
**Aelkarrimy**: I don't know what.
**Aelkarrimy**: You know this whole building.
**Aelkarrimy**: Does it matter if those outlets come out of one of the new panels or if they're out of an existing panel?
**Cheryl.green**: You mean.
**Cheryl.green**: So it's depend on the electrical design.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah.
**Aelkarrimy**: And Brian, I don't know.
**Aelkarrimy**: That's why I asked Mike if he talked to you yet about him.
**Aelkarrimy**: It looks like he's doing a little more investigation.
**Aelkarrimy**: But how many of it.
**Aelkarrimy**: How many of those workstation outlets were there already?
**Aelkarrimy**: An outlet at the column.
**Aelkarrimy**: Mike, you there?
**Bryan.wagar**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Believe it was nine.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And Again, I'll.
**Bclymer**: I'll get something marked up and send that out.
**Bschwartz**: Sorry, Is the question here?
**Bschwartz**: There's nine receptacles at columns already.
**Bschwartz**: And the question is, can those be repurposed for workstation receptacles that were shown on the drawings?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Bschwartz**: I mean, I guess that's a question for you, Suke.
**Bschwartz**: There's nothing engineering wise that's wrong with that.
**Bschwartz**: So.
**Kevin.ly**: Do we know who's.
**Kevin.ly**: Who's those outlets belong to?
**Kevin.ly**: Who that are currently installed?
**Kevin.ly**: Do they belong to the warehouse?
**Cheryl.green**: Is that question to me?
**Kevin.ly**: Well, yeah.
**Kevin.ly**: Because Yusuke, what they're trying to do right now is to try to save you this $600 additional cost for the permits by reducing something in the electrical scope in order to accommodate this as a favor.
**Kevin.ly**: So they're asking you if there's currently some outlets located along those columns within our area of.
**Kevin.ly**: Can we utilize those columns and relocate those printing stations or desks to those areas?
**Kevin.ly**: This way we can avoid.
**Aelkarrimy**: Ahmed, you don't even have to relocate them.
**Aelkarrimy**: They're in the right spot.
**Kevin.ly**: They're already in the right spots.
**Kevin.ly**: But would this be part of our electrical output?
**Kevin.ly**: Or is this part of the warehouse electrical?
**Kevin.ly**: So now these printers are connected to our power supply or the warehouse powers.
**Jdawson**: Right?
**Aelkarrimy**: That's what I think Mike was going to chase down.
**Aelkarrimy**: Like where they're fed from.
**Aelkarrimy**: And then we'll give that to you and Brian and Yusuke.
**Aelkarrimy**: And then you can tell us.
**Aelkarrimy**: Hey, yeah.
**Aelkarrimy**: Just reuse them and then we'll just deduct it on the electrical.
**Cheryl.green**: Okay.
**Cheryl.green**: But we're not changing any location for the outlets.
**Cheryl.green**: Even it's for the system or our warehouse side.
**Jdawson**: No.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Aelkarrimy**: Like, that's why I don't know if you wanted to.
**Aelkarrimy**: Like if those outlets are in that area and they wouldn't be used for anything else.
**Aelkarrimy**: It doesn't appear they would.
**Aelkarrimy**: Then it doesn't make any sense to install a new outlet there.
**Aelkarrimy**: Unless they're fed from a panel that's on someone else's electrical bill, you know?
**Bschwartz**: Are they quads?
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Bschwartz**: I think that would be the only point that may hold us up is if they're fed from something that's feeding the.
**Bschwartz**: The third.
**Bschwartz**: The other tenant space.
**Bschwartz**: But.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: What do we do at that point if it is someone else's?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Because the new lines we are supposed to put up are supposed to be at that location.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Do we cut them off or.
**Jdawson**: Well, no.
**Kevin.ly**: The ones that are currently installed.
**Kevin.ly**: Keba.
**Kevin.ly**: They would just remain in position.
**Kevin.ly**: Currently we have new outlets that are being Installed to the sides of the tables or the desks or the workstations.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Right.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So the workstation.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: The ones that are going to the workstations, there's nothing there now but the ones along the columns.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: There are outlets there now.
**Bschwartz**: Yeah.
**Bschwartz**: I'd say if they're fed from someone else's panel, then the choices would be either coordinate with them to gain the approval to remove or leave them in place.
**Bschwartz**: But considering that they're within the Uniqlo warehouse space.
**Bschwartz**: Don't quote me on this, but I'm going to go out on a limb and say that they're probably not fed from another tenant's electrical service.
**Aelkarrimy**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Even if they are fed from another tenant, we've.
**Mparsons**: We pay for all the electrical as unicroll.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Bschwartz**: Yeah, I wasn't even aware that was the other thing I was going to say is I don't even think that there's sub metering for that other tenant space anyway.
**Jdawson**: So there isn't any sub meter.
**Aelkarrimy**: Here we go.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yusuke, we're saving you money every chance we get.
**Cheryl.green**: Okay, we'll see.
**Bryan.wagar**: Let's.
**Bryan.wagar**: Let's find some ways to save Exotech some money too.
**Kevin.ly**: Well, I mean, Jesse, if we are going to eliminate those outlets, we just want to see the.
**Kevin.ly**: That change order.
**Kevin.ly**: That shows how the return of those outlets versus, like, just to see all the credits, basically.
**Kevin.ly**: And then whatever is left over from the credits would remain for whatever other change orders that would come down the pipeline.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah, we can do that and put it into a contingency for you, if you want, and just set that aside.
**Bryan.wagar**: I think that's the smartest move.
**Bschwartz**: Yeah, I would agree with that.
**Jdawson**: Good.
**Aelkarrimy**: Well, it doesn't sound like we really need to hunt it down other than just they need to know where those things are fed from so that we can.
**Aelkarrimy**: They'll know where to go if something trips Mike.
**Aelkarrimy**: So trace down wherever those are fed from, get that info in an RFI and send it off.
**Bschwartz**: Are those.
**Bschwartz**: I'm assuming, since we don't know off the top of our heads what those are fed from, that they're not labeled per.
**Bschwartz**: Well, they're not labeled per our specifications.
**Bschwartz**: Is that something you guys can.
**Bschwartz**: Can do as part of.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah, we'll make them put the.
**Aelkarrimy**: Whatever labeling.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: That we got.
**Aelkarrimy**: For everything else, we'll have them labeled.
**Aelkarrimy**: We'll just take out whatever we can take out.
**Aelkarrimy**: And you know, if the.
**Aelkarrimy**: If the outlets are wrong, we still got to put an outlet on or whatever.
**Aelkarrimy**: We'll just reflect all of that to what you know, it's just not having to run a wire out there and do all that, you know.
**Bschwartz**: Yeah, I think what's.
**Bschwartz**: What would be best for the Uniqlo team is to bring those up to what was in the contract documents, but save where we can on feeder and conduit and stuff like that, so.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: Anything else.
**Kevin.ly**: Good on TPG Z?
**Bclymer**: All right, well, I think we're good for now.
**Kevin.ly**: Mike.
**Cheryl.green**: Mike.
**Cheryl.green**: Sorry, Kevin.
**Cheryl.green**: We need a conditional lien waiver and the invoice for June.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Cheryl.green**: So, Mike, can you share us the conditional lean Weaver?
**Bryan.wagar**: Oh, we received it today.
**Cheryl.green**: Oh, we received it today.
**Cheryl.green**: Oh, okay.
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Thank you.
**Cheryl.green**: I didn't check that yet.
**Aelkarrimy**: Hey, Kevin, is our accountant struggling to get that thing submitted into your system?
**Jdawson**: Yes, they're having trouble uploading into our payment system.
**Aelkarrimy**: But they did the first one, didn't they?
**Aelkarrimy**: And.
**Aelkarrimy**: Or was that the first.
**Bryan.wagar**: The first one I did for them.
**Jdawson**: Oh, okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: Is it simple?
**Aelkarrimy**: I can tomorrow?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, it should be.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Aelkarrimy**: I'll get with them in the morning and see what the issue is.
**Aelkarrimy**: Hopefully we get it figured out.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Cheryl.green**: Nothing on my end.
**Bclymer**: All right, I think we're good then.
**Bclymer**: We'll keep in touch.
**Bclymer**: Appreciate everybody getting on.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Aelkarrimy**: Thanks, everybody.
**Kevin.ly**: Thanks, everyone.
**Jdawson**: Have a good evening.
**Bschwartz**: Thanks, everyone.
**Jdawson**: Thank you.
**Daisuke.mine**: Thank you.
**Jdawson**: Thank you.
**Jdawson**: You suka.
**Kevin.ly**: Did you need me to hang back at all or are you good?
**Cheryl.green**: I'm good, but for the change orders, we don't have to do anything right now, right?
**Kevin.ly**: Well, they're saying they're.
**Kevin.ly**: They're going to be able to potentially save you costs on outlets by eliminating the outlets that we were going to install.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, but.
**Cheryl.green**: Okay, okay, I understand that.
**Cheryl.green**: But just for saving 5 or 650, we're going to reduce the number of Yusuke.
**Kevin.ly**: I agree and I understand where you're coming from, but given this type of project, typically there's change orders when it comes to an ASRs system.
**Kevin.ly**: If you speak to any engineer or any of these consultants, like Exotech and whatnot, they would tell you that typically in these kind of projects, we do see change orders.
**Kevin.ly**: Not to that magnitude of electrical changes as we're going through, but there will be change orders during this project that is a standard.
**Kevin.ly**: And I understand you did not want to kind of go through that and you wanted everything to be a lump sum and you didn't want any change orders.
**Kevin.ly**: But for example, we don't hold.
**Kevin.ly**: We are not the dob, so I can't tell you.
**Kevin.ly**: Oh, your permit costs are going to cost $10,563.80, I can tell you.
**Kevin.ly**: Let's carry an allowance of $10,000, and if it exceeds it, it'll be a change.
**Kevin.ly**: That's what I can.
**Kevin.ly**: That's what we can provide as a service for you.
**Kevin.ly**: So.
**Cheryl.green**: Yeah, yeah, I'm not, I'm not like, I'm not saying that your contract is.
**Bryan.wagar**: No, no.
**Kevin.ly**: But my, My only issue is, is that us saying, all right, let's eliminate.
**Kevin.ly**: I want to see then if you're going to eliminate those change orders.
**Kevin.ly**: I'm sorry, those outlets, our credit should be a lot higher than $563.
**Kevin.ly**: So I want to see that.
**Kevin.ly**: Those numbers.
**Kevin.ly**: Because when they sent us the change order for eight outlets and their drops, it was about $9,000.
**Kevin.ly**: So $9,000 versus $563.
**Kevin.ly**: I have a big credit here that we should gain.
**Kevin.ly**: So if we do decide to go this route, where you're going to move desks closer to the columns where there are existing outlets, this way we can eliminate the outlet that we were going to install.
**Kevin.ly**: You're saving money, and they're going to basically pay that change order through using that money.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, and the.
**Bryan.wagar**: And the other.
**Bryan.wagar**: And sorry, not about not.
**Bryan.wagar**: Not the jump in here, but the, the other part to that, Yuzuka, is adding outlets is not a big.
**Bryan.wagar**: Is not a big ordeal.
**Bryan.wagar**: You know, if at the end of this project, you're like, hey, we don't like where the deaths are.
**Bryan.wagar**: We do want to move them back.
**Bryan.wagar**: To be honest, you can hire any electrician in the area and say, hey, we want outlets here, here, and here.
**Mparsons**: And.
**Bryan.wagar**: And then, you know, have those installed.
**Bryan.wagar**: You know, yes, you will be paying for them through somebody else now, but that type of work just for 120 outlets is.
**Bryan.wagar**: Is.
**Bryan.wagar**: Is kind of like what you learn day one in electrical.
**Bryan.wagar**: So, I mean, this isn't.
**Bryan.wagar**: This isn't something that you're just stuck permanently with.
**Bryan.wagar**: Like, either way, you're going to pay for it.
**Bryan.wagar**: But if you wanted it right now, it saves you money.
**Bryan.wagar**: And like Ahmed said, I agree completely with how he's taking this.
**Bryan.wagar**: Is if we're going to eliminate them, I want to see how much money it's saving first.
**Bryan.wagar**: Because if it's not labor, yeah, there's labor involved.
**Bryan.wagar**: You know, you're hoping it's a couple grand that you're going to save.
**Kevin.ly**: There's cabling, there's the outlet itself, then there's labor.
**Kevin.ly**: Like, this is a.
**Kevin.ly**: This is a hefty credit that would come back to us.
**Kevin.ly**: So I want to see that if we are going to go that route.
**Kevin.ly**: So just before we just say, yeah, let's.
**Kevin.ly**: Let's cancel those outlets.
**Kevin.ly**: Let's make sure that the money that's coming back to our pockets is the correct number.
**Bryan.wagar**: Because if it's only saving you a thousand, you might want to say, you know what, let's do it.
**Kevin.ly**: We should do it then right away.
**Kevin.ly**: But if he's giving you $9,000 like he did when he wanted to charge us for eight outlets, then sure, let's definitely save that cost of $8,000.
**Kevin.ly**: But if it's only $1,000.
**Kevin.ly**: Yasuke, you're buying new outlets.
**Kevin.ly**: You're installing everything new.
**Kevin.ly**: I would just buy, like, pay the $560 change order, because now it's going to be a big exercise.
**Kevin.ly**: Then they're going to start trying to trace cabling.
**Kevin.ly**: Then they're going to say, oh, this is feeding this panel.
**Kevin.ly**: Is it okay for us to load this many amperage on it?
**Kevin.ly**: It's going to unravel into a bigger conversation versus just paying the $560 that was over.
**Cheryl.green**: Okay, okay, okay.
**Cheryl.green**: So first step, we have to see how much money will be saving saved.
**Jdawson**: Correct.
**Kevin.ly**: Based on their.
**Cheryl.green**: Their quotes or something.
**Bryan.wagar**: Not the quotes.
**Cheryl.green**: The.
**Jdawson**: The credit.
**Kevin.ly**: I want to see the credits.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Kevin.ly**: Once we have the credits, I think then we can make a decision.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And then I.
**Jdawson**: Go ahead.
**Kevin.ly**: No, I'm sorry.
**Aelkarrimy**: Go ahead.
**Cheryl.green**: And my.
**Cheryl.green**: My point was that it's just for five or six hundred bucks, and we have to do some kind of, you know, paying, Paying work is.
**Kevin.ly**: Keep in mind.
**Kevin.ly**: But just keep in mind, you're asking for a favor.
**Kevin.ly**: Now down the line, when you ask for another favor, they're.
**Kevin.ly**: They're going to say no.
**Kevin.ly**: So, like, I would choose your favors strategically for something this small, 560 bucks.
**Kevin.ly**: I would pay the change order versus when we need a favor, like when we set the fire alarm relay and the outlets were not shown, they did the favor by eliminating those change orders right away because they were conversations that you and I and Brandon had prior to awarding the gc.
**Kevin.ly**: So I would be very strategic with how you make this decision.
**Jdawson**: That's all.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Cheryl.green**: Okay.
**Cheryl.green**: Yeah, I understand that it's too small for using one of the favor there.
**Kevin.ly**: But yeah, and they're going to eliminate something extremely big in order to accommodate something very small.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Cheryl.green**: And I'm not sure when, if we receive the quotes like that, when was the limit to pay to them?
**Cheryl.green**: I'm not sure.
**Cheryl.green**: Like, those kind of schedule.
**Kevin.ly**: Wait, what do you mean?
**Cheryl.green**: Like, if you receive 500 quotes, when is the deadline for, like, paying to them?
**Jdawson**: About that.
**Kevin.ly**: Well, no, I mean.
**Kevin.ly**: I mean, it's.
**Kevin.ly**: The project's ongoing.
**Kevin.ly**: We pulled the permits already.
**Kevin.ly**: They paid the 560.
**Kevin.ly**: They're just letting you know that you owe us an additional $563.
**Cheryl.green**: Okay, that could.
**Kevin.ly**: That's going to sit as an open change order until we say approved.
**Kevin.ly**: And then you guys go through the invoicing through coupa and whatnot, and then everything is.
**Kevin.ly**: Is ironed out, and then they add it to the total of the 3 million and some change.
**Cheryl.green**: Okay, so what is.
**Cheryl.green**: Is it possible that if we receive the change orders, we can keep it in pain at the end?
**Kevin.ly**: Let me ask Kevin that question, but I would assume yes, because my other client, Mutual of America, who also uses Koopa, we kept all the change orders till the end of the project, and then we paid everything one shot at the end of the project.
**Kevin.ly**: So that is an option I believe is available, but again, it defers from one GC to the other.
**Kevin.ly**: So if you give me just until tomorrow, I'll gather that information from Kevin and Jess.
**Bryan.wagar**: Because.
**Cheryl.green**: It'S annoying for us to pay very little amount of money every single time.
**Cheryl.green**: So we want to do one shot as much.
**Cheryl.green**: But you took a one shot.
**Kevin.ly**: But I get you.
**Kevin.ly**: But again, I. I just want to reiterate that any engineer that has worked on a ASRs system will tell you that change orders is the name of the game when it comes to this, because little field conditions when the racks are up and whatnot, when we start the tooling, there might be some change orders that might open up to.
**Kevin.ly**: And when it comes to this kind of a project, it's.
**Jdawson**: It's standard.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Kevin.ly**: Change orders.
**Bryan.wagar**: And I just want to remind everybody that there's this Firefly thing still hoarding on here.
**Kevin.ly**: That's not mine.
**Jdawson**: How do we take him out, people?
