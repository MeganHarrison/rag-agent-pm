## Transcript
**Mcalcetero**: That's.
**Mcalcetero**: I don't know how that, how you do the.
**Mcalcetero**: A profit like that's just based off of, you know, if the whole job is X, what percentage is that?
**Mcalcetero**: I'm not really sure how that works.
**Mcalcetero**: So yeah, I would say, you know, anywhere from, you know, like I said 1, 82 million to 3, you know, ish.
**Bdclymer926**: Sure.
**Bdclymer926**: You know, I don't know if we talked about it.
**Bdclymer926**: One of the guys on our team, it.
**Bdclymer926**: His last, like the bulk of his career was spent as CFO of a large construction company.
**Bdclymer926**: Like a billion and a half dollar kind of construction company.
**Bdclymer926**: And so, you know, generally when we have clients and construction and whatnot, he's able to help them find significant value, you know, in, in ways other than taxes, even though, you know, he's a CPA and things like that.
**Bdclymer926**: But he might be able to add a lot of value depending on how your year shakes out, you know, because if you are looking at that 2,3 million plus kind of taxable income, I know we could probably cut that tax bill in half, you know, but then really the rest of it, I mean, we met back in December.
**Bdclymer926**: You were talking about, you know, Rockefeller method and trust planning, estate planning, etc, you know, wanting to make sure that you do the right kind of planning.
**Bdclymer926**: You know, you told, you were telling me about being the first person in your family to ever go to college and yeah know, wanting to make sure that you're a good steward of the things you built, whatnot.
**Bdclymer926**: And so, you know, I mean, I don't know to what extent all that is meaningful to you or not, but.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, you know, there's definitely a lot.
**Bdclymer926**: Of planning that we could help with.
**Bdclymer926**: You know, I just.
**Bdclymer926**: One of the things that.
**Bdclymer926**: Hi, Maria.
**Bdclymer926**: Nice to meet you.
**Bdclymer926**: I'm Jeff.
**Bclymer**: Nice to meet you, Jeff.
**Bclymer**: Hi.
**Mcalcetero**: This is the actual boss.
**Mcalcetero**: So she's the one that actually calls the shots.
**Bclymer**: Exactly.
**Mcalcetero**: The one that actually I see, I see Bridget smiling as well.
**Mcalcetero**: She's like, that's funny.
**Mcalcetero**: I'm the same.
**Bdclymer926**: Yeah, that's.
**Bdclymer926**: The two bosses, they know where the dead bodies are.
**Bdclymer926**: You know, they know where they experience all the skeletons.
**Bdclymer926**: So, you know, I mean, the, the reason why I was kind of digging in around the tax piece, Brandon, is the.
**Bdclymer926**: You know, I really pride ourselves on making sure that we more than pay for ourselves.
**Bdclymer926**: I don't really like being in the expense column of somebody's life.
**Bdclymer926**: And so, you know, we generally try in every engagement to make sure that we are more than paying for ourselves and quantified value where we can point to it and say here, because of the way that we, you know, did this or did that, we saved you money here, made you money there.
**Bdclymer926**: That, that is money you can point to that as a result of our work, you know, you know, that we more than paid for ourselves.
**Bdclymer926**: So the worst case scenario is you end up with some free advisors.
**Bdclymer926**: I just, I don't like, you know, I don't, I don't like being in a position where we're not, we're not worth what we're charging, you know, and so taxes are a big piece of it.
**Bdclymer926**: But I mean we've restructured banking relationships, we've restructured debt for people.
**Bdclymer926**: We've, you know, helped E commerce companies rework their merchant banking.
**Bdclymer926**: You know, we've helped large companies restructure benefit programs and insurance.
**Bdclymer926**: You know, you know, some construction companies, we've, we've audited all their insurances and helped them redo those to, you know, it's kind of like are you guys.
**Mcalcetero**: Do you guys just looking for quantified.
**Bdclymer926**: Value anywhere we can, huh?
**Mcalcetero**: Do you guys have an in house cpa?
**Bdclymer926**: We don't prep and file returns, but yeah, we do have no CPAs on staff.
**Mcalcetero**: The reason I ask is we're going through an audit right now and it's the bane of my existence and so I just absolutely hate it.
**Mcalcetero**: And that's why I asked because evidently it has to be a, you know, CPA that does it and it sucks.
**Bdclymer926**: Yeah, those do suck.
**Bdclymer926**: And you know, audited financials are expensive and that does suck.
**Mcalcetero**: It's the time that, it's the time that bothers the hell out of me.
**Bdclymer926**: Yeah.
**Mcalcetero**: Like, why does something take so long?
**Bdclymer926**: Yeah.
**Bdclymer926**: Well, when you have to have audited financials, you basically have to have a third party go and basically go through every transaction in your business for that time period and validate and verify every transaction which is, you know, if you have a hundred thousand transactions in the year, it's just tedious as work.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, yeah, it's pain in dick.
**Bdclymer926**: Yeah.
**Bdclymer926**: Giant pain.
**Bdclymer926**: So we don't do that work.
**Bdclymer926**: Yeah, but, but I'm sorry you're having to go through that.
**Mcalcetero**: It's, I mean it's, we have to, we're getting another, A license, another state.
**Mcalcetero**: It just is what it is, you know.
**Bdclymer926**: Yeah, it's super annoying.
**Bdclymer926**: But I guess tell me with all, with it, with all that we've discussed kind of what's on your mind or what would be the top three things for you?
**Bdclymer926**: You know, hey, if, if, if we were to go to work for you this year and start trying to help, you know, what would be the top three things you're like, man, Jeff, aside from audited financials, what would kind of be like top three things you'd hope that we could accomplish for you?
**Mcalcetero**: So the biggest thing that, that I'm looking for, and I know we have some other tax companies that we're interviewing with it, I think Maria's got appointments set up and one like, basically like what I'm looking for is I know that right now, like, you know, I started in real estate.
**Mcalcetero**: I still have some real estate, but it's not my primary driver.
**Mcalcetero**: I'll get into more and more development.
**Mcalcetero**: But right now, 90% of all my income is from a business.
**Mcalcetero**: And being able to write that off to where I'm not either coming up with clever ways to spend it or giving it to the government is the biggest goal.
**Mcalcetero**: It's like, how can I start to hold this and save this in some manner?
**Mcalcetero**: And that way I can truly build a passive wealth machine through different investment streams and to where if, you know, tomorrow, you know, something happens and, and I'm in a wheelchair and can't work or whatever, then it's, I'm taken care of.
**Mcalcetero**: And you know, one day when I'm married and have kids, my family's taken care of and whatnot.
**Bdclymer926**: Yeah, that makes sense.
**Mcalcetero**: So, I mean, that's, that's the big driver for me, you know, I mean, is, is starting to, to have that, I'd say robust back end, passive financial success, you might say.
**Mcalcetero**: Or security be probably a better word.
**Bdclymer926**: Yeah, the way we talk about it, you know, after working with so many entrepreneurs, I kind of realized that there's this threshold that most people are on one side or the other and the goals are all expressed differently, but they're similar on either side.
**Bdclymer926**: And you know where you're at.
**Bdclymer926**: What we talk about is, is how do we cross the freedom threshold, is what we call it, where your balance sheet, your assets, et cetera, can support you indefinitely for the rest of your life.
**Bdclymer926**: Where, you know, hey, I'm never going to run out of money.
**Bdclymer926**: I'm never going to be in a bad spot where I can't pay my bills.
**Bdclymer926**: And we basically go through all the tools and all of the strategies and all the everything that we know, relying on our network and our knowledge to go through cash flow planning and risk management, legal and tax and investing to try to accelerate you across that threshold as fast as possible and map it out to where you can then have clarity about it and have peace of mind, knowing, hey, I.
**Bdclymer926**: I've gotten to this point where, you know, my livelihood, my living is no longer dependent on my labor, trading time for money, my earned income.
**Bdclymer926**: Right.
**Bdclymer926**: My P and L.
**Bdclymer926**: And I can rely on my balance sheet, and it's a big deal.
**Bdclymer926**: And so we measure it, we track it, we can report on it.
**Bdclymer926**: I think one of the biggest things that happens is when you haven't crossed that threshold, you kind of tend to approach life.
**Bdclymer926**: Most people tend to approach life from a place of sort of high need.
**Bdclymer926**: You know, I feel like, I need to get this deal, or I need to pay less taxes, or I need to get this thing, or I need this.
**Bdclymer926**: I need that.
**Bdclymer926**: Right.
**Bdclymer926**: And it causes us to have low power in our negotiations and our decision making.
**Bdclymer926**: And once you're clearly across that threshold, it's like a paradigm shift where you're kind of.
**Bdclymer926**: You kind of realize everything sets in, that you don't need anything.
**Bdclymer926**: It's like, I don't need that person.
**Bdclymer926**: I don't need that deal.
**Bdclymer926**: I don't need this thing.
**Bdclymer926**: It doesn't matter.
**Bdclymer926**: This doesn't matter, and that doesn't matter.
**Bdclymer926**: And so you can approach your decision making from a place of high power, and you're negotiating from a place of high power going, you don't need any of it.
**Bdclymer926**: Right.
**Bdclymer926**: And so everything that happens beyond that point is simply about scaling your legacy and impact.
**Bdclymer926**: And so we want to basically use everything that's at our disposal to help accelerate you across that threshold as fast as possible.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, no, I.
**Mcalcetero**: I agree with that.
**Mcalcetero**: I mean, that's.
**Mcalcetero**: It's the.
**Mcalcetero**: I think the goal that most of us have.
**Mcalcetero**: So.
**Mcalcetero**: So I guess, you know, you mentioned a bunch of services and stuff that you guys do.
**Mcalcetero**: I mean, do you guys have like a.
**Mcalcetero**: You probably have a list or something like that?
**Mcalcetero**: Or like, hey, Brandon, you know, after talking to you, looking at your goals, this is what we think.
**Mcalcetero**: You know, you would need to get to that.
**Mcalcetero**: Like, this is what that looks like, you know?
**Bdclymer926**: Yeah.
**Bdclymer926**: The way that we accomplish that is through our first 90 days.
**Bdclymer926**: So in the first 90 days of working with a client, we go through really exhaustive discovery.
**Bdclymer926**: So thank God you have people like Maria on your team that can probably help.
**Bdclymer926**: We try to work with anybody else on your team that has the information, so it's less painful and less time consuming on your part.
**Bdclymer926**: We want to know everything about everything when it comes to taxes and financials and investments and legal documentation, et cetera.
**Bdclymer926**: So we have pretty exhaustive wish list of information.
**Bdclymer926**: We want to read everything, go through it all, get it all crystal organized, really clear.
**Bdclymer926**: Then we basically go and start flowcharting your entity structure, your cash flow, forecasting that into five years and even breaking down into 12 month calendars.
**Bdclymer926**: We look at risk management analysis, we go through, you know, how all your investments and assets and liquidity are held.
**Bdclymer926**: We're looking at legal structures that that second phase is all about, analyzing it all.
**Bdclymer926**: And then we lay out for you, here's all the improvement opportunities we see in the solutions.
**Bdclymer926**: What we think we should do in the areas of cash flow and risk management, legal, tax and, and investing whatever capital you have.
**Bdclymer926**: And we turn that.
**Bdclymer926**: You'll probably appreciate this because you're a design build firm.
**Bdclymer926**: So I grew up in a family owned construction company and that's, that's probably influences how we approach work now.
**Bdclymer926**: But we are essentially a design build firm.
**Bdclymer926**: We just don't build buildings.
**Bdclymer926**: You know, we build micro family office for you and then help manage it because otherwise you have to task somebody like Maria to do it and then that's a completely second job.
**Bdclymer926**: Right.
**Bdclymer926**: So setting all that up and putting it into a scope of work and then a schedule, we use a very simplified Gantt chart.
**Bdclymer926**: You probably like Gantt charts.
**Bdclymer926**: Most construction firms organize schedules with them.
**Bdclymer926**: But so it's very simplified Gantt chart and scope of work that says this is what we're doing and how long we think it's going to take.
**Bdclymer926**: And we put together at the end of that 90 days a chart that basically lays out, here's the quantified value that says, all right, here's the, the ways that we think we're going to make you money and save you money that you're not doing and what that net benefit is.
**Bdclymer926**: And you know, I'd say generally if you're, if you were going to end up in the 2 or 3 million of income range or the quantified value in that, in that scenario would typically be, you know, probably two to $500,000, maybe more.
**Bdclymer926**: But generally something in that range is to be expected.
**Bdclymer926**: And, and so it basically takes 90 days to build it all.
**Bdclymer926**: It's kind of like if, if, if you're going to do a design build project and build me a building, you know, you have to go through that design phase to really be able to lay out what's the building going to look like.
**Bdclymer926**: And it, it's, it's, there's a hell of a lot more involved than just saying well, Jeff, you said you're a growing company and you need space, you know.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah.
**Bdclymer926**: So it's like, you know, the design part is real.
**Bdclymer926**: And I think, I think unfortunately what happens in professional services, whether it's financial advisors, insurance people, bankers, attorneys, all of it, they all shortcut the design piece.
**Bdclymer926**: They all skip the design piece.
**Bdclymer926**: You know, they, people just don't put the time and energy there and then you don't end up with the desired outcome.
**Bdclymer926**: I mean, you, you probably know it from your work if you, basically the, the construction, the build part is, is, is directly correlated to how well you did the design part.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah.
**Bdclymer926**: And so to me I'm like, you know, yes, execution matters, but if you start with a crappy design, you're, you know, you're screwed from the start, you know.
**Mcalcetero**: Right.
**Bdclymer926**: So, so, you know, my undergrad was in engineering and growing up in construction, that's kind of how we think about it.
**Bdclymer926**: Whenever I started in finance, you might like this, Brandon, but whenever I started in finance, I thought, I know, I'm just going to go help construction companies.
**Bdclymer926**: But that was almost 20 years ago and most construction companies are really old school and if you don't, if you're not old, they're like you, you know that you have to be like 60 to be trusted.
**Bdclymer926**: And so like 27, trying to tell like a CEO what to do about their 100 million dollar construction company.
**Bdclymer926**: They're like, get out of here, kid.
**Bdclymer926**: You know, it's just, it's really tough.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah.
**Mcalcetero**: But so I remember like, I was like, you don't really get respected in the industry until you're at least 30.
**Mcalcetero**: And I remember being like 28, like.
**Bdclymer926**: Probably not even trusted until you're 40.
**Bdclymer926**: Yeah, yeah.
**Mcalcetero**: I was like, hot shot PM like whatever.
**Mcalcetero**: I was, I remember I was building the hospital and I was like, hey, you know, telling a frame or something, whatever.
**Mcalcetero**: Like, you know, this is wrong or you know, this is like I've been doing this for 30 years.
**Mcalcetero**: All right.
**Mcalcetero**: I said, well, some people learn slower than others, I'll tell you.
**Bdclymer926**: That's awesome.
**Bdclymer926**: Yeah.
**Bdclymer926**: No, I mean, I, I, I feel like I've had two careers because growing up in a family owned, it was electrical contractor.
**Bdclymer926**: I mean, I got dropped off for my journeyman's license by my mom because I couldn't drive, you know, and love that for you.
**Mcalcetero**: Then I got the guys just harassed the out of you.
**Bdclymer926**: Oh yeah.
**Bdclymer926**: And I, you know, so I'm like the, you know, the earliest I can remember getting in a truck with a Construction crew to go to a job site with no parental supervision.
**Bdclymer926**: Was probably about 10 years old.
**Bdclymer926**: And I remember taking that test and there was some guy, I don't know, he was a talker.
**Bdclymer926**: And I was like, he was gonna take it too.
**Bdclymer926**: And I was like, if I pass and you don't, then you have to quit.
**Bdclymer926**: And I passed and he didn't.
**Bdclymer926**: And I was like, freaking quitting.
**Bdclymer926**: And my dad was like, stop.
**Bdclymer926**: He's one of my good guys.
**Bdclymer926**: He's not quitting.
**Bdclymer926**: I was like, he, it was a deal.
**Bdclymer926**: He has to quit.
**Bdclymer926**: You know, my dad was so pissed, he's like, shut up.
**Bdclymer926**: He's not quitting.
**Bdclymer926**: You know, that's awesome.
**Bdclymer926**: And, yeah, I got my hardship license when I was 15, so I could drive a truck and run a crew.
**Bdclymer926**: Yeah, it was some good old child labor.
**Mcalcetero**: Gotta love it.
**Bdclymer926**: Yeah, I.
**Bdclymer926**: It feels like.
**Bdclymer926**: It feels like looking back, like half child slave labor, but the other half, if I look at it positively, is they were just teaching me work ethic, which today is a, you know, exceedingly rare.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah.
**Mcalcetero**: So I was.
**Mcalcetero**: I had a guy, like, easily had to fly home from a job because his birthday, I'm like, birthday, It's a day celebrated on a weekend.
**Mcalcetero**: What, are you kidding me?
**Mcalcetero**: Get to work.
**Bdclymer926**: Yeah.
**Bdclymer926**: Yeah, it's so.
**Bdclymer926**: It's been two decades of me trying to learn to manage white collar professionals.
**Bdclymer926**: Because what I find is that and professional services, they don't respond well to blue collar management.
**Mcalcetero**: So, yeah, it's definitely different.
**Mcalcetero**: Especially, like, it's funny because I'll, you know, I talk to attorneys or whatever, and I'm straightforward to the point, like, rough around the edges.
**Mcalcetero**: And sometimes I go and I'm like, you know, but I'll do it with a smile on my face.
**Mcalcetero**: Like, it's supposed to do it.
**Mcalcetero**: Like, oh, okay, like, whatever, weird construction guy.
**Bdclymer926**: Yeah.
**Bdclymer926**: And, you know, you.
**Bdclymer926**: And I think that's the nice version because if it was on the job site, it would sound a lot different.
**Bdclymer926**: And yes, they think you're being hardcore.
**Bdclymer926**: And you're like, you don't even know hardcore.
**Mcalcetero**: I literally had this conversation with this guy.
**Mcalcetero**: He was like, you know, he's like, well, you were just very rude, man.
**Mcalcetero**: I was just direct.
**Mcalcetero**: I just told you what I wanted you to hear.
**Mcalcetero**: Like, but if you would like me to, like, throw in some niceties, like, oh, hey, Ryan, how was your weekend?
**Mcalcetero**: Do anything fun?
**Mcalcetero**: Like, I can play that bullshit game, but in reality, we're here to do a job.
**Mcalcetero**: So if you want to, you know, Just get that done.
**Mcalcetero**: That'd be great.
**Bdclymer926**: Yeah, you're like, you're like that shit will get you beat up if you say that shit on a construction site.
**Bdclymer926**: And you want me to think I'm going to walk in here and do it?
**Bdclymer926**: I mean, are you kidding?
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah.
**Mcalcetero**: Come on.
**Bdclymer926**: It's tough.
**Bdclymer926**: But fortunately there I, we're lucky enough to have tough people like Chad and Bridget that put up with me.
**Jeff**: So I do want to say one thing because you guys were talking about being kids and I was in the hole pouring concrete, ran electrical probably when I was six.
**Jeff**: But I'm the only person in my family and I think you made this comment whenever I hopped on that you're the only person to graduate college from your family.
**Jeff**: So kudos to you because it's a good feeling.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah.
**Mcalcetero**: Small family though, so I mean, you know, it's not like it's a big feat.
**Jeff**: Oh well, it's still feet family.
**Bdclymer926**: Oh.
**Bdclymer926**: So anyways, yeah, so you, you'll probably appreciate my style then, Brandon, because.
**Bdclymer926**: And I'll probably appreciate yours.
**Bdclymer926**: But yeah, so that's, that's how we go about it.
**Bdclymer926**: The way that, the way that the fees work for the engagement, we charge nine grand a month.
**Bdclymer926**: The once we're 90 days in, we've basically gone through that nine.
**Bdclymer926**: That, that thing about like the design phase.
**Bdclymer926**: Right.
**Bdclymer926**: And so to put it in construction terms, 90 days in, we basically have construction drawings, you know, that are engineered and ready to go.
**Bdclymer926**: So we know what we're going to build and we know how we're going to build it and what order we're going to build it in and things like that.
**Bdclymer926**: And.
**Bdclymer926**: But that's also a really good sort of checkpoint to go.
**Bdclymer926**: Hey, you know, like I told you, I don't whatever the opposite of entitled is.
**Bdclymer926**: I anti entitlement.
**Bdclymer926**: And so, you know, we need to earn our keep.
**Bdclymer926**: And so if we sort of finish that design part and figure out that, hey, I don't know how we're going to add more quantified value than we cost.
**Bdclymer926**: You know, then we probably look at adjusting the scope and schedule in a way that allows us to maybe cut the feed down to where we can cover our cost and still add the critical pieces that still add value in your life.
**Bdclymer926**: I just really don't.
**Bdclymer926**: You know, if, if it, if you pay us a dollar and we put two back in your pocket, that's a long term relationship.
**Bdclymer926**: But if it's the other way around, it doesn't last very long, you know.
**Mcalcetero**: Right.
**Mcalcetero**: So, so 90 days.
**Mcalcetero**: 18 grand is your discovery phase, right?
**Bdclymer926**: That's 27, but.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah.
**Bdclymer926**: Nine times three.
**Mcalcetero**: I'm sorry.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah.
**Mcalcetero**: See, what am I doing?
**Mcalcetero**: I can't even count.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay, cool.
**Mcalcetero**: So.
**Mcalcetero**: And then.
**Mcalcetero**: And then from there, I guess.
**Bdclymer926**: And even in that, if we got.
**Bdclymer926**: Not three months in and we couldn't find you more value than what you'd already pay us, we'd refund the difference.
**Bdclymer926**: We put it in writing that we will.
**Bdclymer926**: And we also, you know, whenever I sign stuff, I always think, how do I get out of it?
**Bdclymer926**: And so the way I wrote our.
**Bdclymer926**: Or had the people write our engagements, you can fire us at any time for any reason whatsoever, you know?
**Mcalcetero**: Okay.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay.
**Mcalcetero**: Where.
**Mcalcetero**: Where are you guys out of, by the way?
**Mcalcetero**: I didn't ask what you guys.
**Mcalcetero**: Are you guys all remote, I guess, or.
**Bdclymer926**: Yeah, we're all remote.
**Bdclymer926**: This is my second firm, and the.
**Bdclymer926**: The first one, I tried to have everybody local, and this time I was like, you know, seems like we can get it all done remote, and instead of spending the money on an office, I can just have more good people.
**Bdclymer926**: But.
**Bdclymer926**: So, for example, Bridget's in Chicago.
**Bdclymer926**: Chad's in Missouri.
**Bdclymer926**: I'm in Austin.
**Bdclymer926**: But we have people everywhere from, I think, Oregon down to Florida, you know, up to, what, Pennsylvania, somewhere up there.
**Bdclymer926**: And California.
**Bdclymer926**: I mean, across the whole country.
**Mcalcetero**: I'm actually.
**Mcalcetero**: I have to.
**Mcalcetero**: As soon as I get done this meeting, I'm actually leaving to go to Chicago right now, so.
**Bdclymer926**: Oh, really?
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah.
**Bdclymer926**: So I.
**Bdclymer926**: I won't even pretend to know my way around Chicago.
**Bdclymer926**: Last time I tried that with somebody, Bridget said, you don't want to say that.
**Mcalcetero**: Oh, yeah, Go Yankees.
**Mcalcetero**: Whatever, you know.
**Mcalcetero**: I don't know.
**Bdclymer926**: I was talking about, like, oh, are you in this part?
**Bdclymer926**: Or whatever.
**Bdclymer926**: She's like.
**Bdclymer926**: It just.
**Bdclymer926**: She's like, if somebody's from Chicago, you're not gonna sound good.
**Mcalcetero**: She's like, just don't.
**Mcalcetero**: Just don't talk, Jeff.
**Bdclymer926**: Just basically, it's like, yeah, just keep that to yourself.
**Mcalcetero**: Awesome.
**Bdclymer926**: Yeah.
**Mcalcetero**: Cool.
**Mcalcetero**: Well, I know that.
**Mcalcetero**: Maria, we.
**Mcalcetero**: I think we've got, what, two interviews.
**Mcalcetero**: Did you.
**Mcalcetero**: Are they next week for other firms?
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Correct.
**Bclymer**: Two.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay, so we're gonna interview with them.
**Bdclymer926**: Are you interviewing firms that do the same stuff that we do, or are you interviewing CPAs to file taxes?
**Mcalcetero**: Both.
**Mcalcetero**: So two.
**Mcalcetero**: Like, one of them is.
**Mcalcetero**: Does the.
**Mcalcetero**: Is all business financial.
**Mcalcetero**: They have a personal side of stuff.
**Mcalcetero**: I haven't met with those guys yet.
**Mcalcetero**: They want.
**Mcalcetero**: They want to.
**Mcalcetero**: They asked me if I.
**Mcalcetero**: If I would bundle it all together, and then the other ones are exactly what you do.
**Mcalcetero**: So, like after I met with you, I was like, okay, I can't remember you or somebody, but they said, you know, get with a few and interview.
**Mcalcetero**: And so I interviewed one a few weeks ago.
**Mcalcetero**: And then I think we've got obviously you, and then another one next week and then this other fourth one.
**Mcalcetero**: You know, we'll see what they say.
**Bdclymer926**: But yeah, who are they?
**Bdclymer926**: Maybe I have some intel on them.
**Bdclymer926**: I can give you Rottweiler.
**Mcalcetero**: Maria is one right?
**Mcalcetero**: Rottweiler tax.
**Mcalcetero**: Is that right?
**Mcalcetero**: And then.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, Rottweiler tax, Rottweiler tax.
**Bclymer**: And then the other one forgot the name.
**Bclymer**: I'll check it out.
**Bclymer**: I think it's something tax something.
**Bclymer**: But yeah, Redwire one is.
**Bclymer**: Is the one that we have.
**Mcalcetero**: And I don't remember what the.
**Mcalcetero**: The other guys will.
**Mcalcetero**: Ed something.
**Bclymer**: Ed, yes.
**Mcalcetero**: The bald guy, he's got a big Instagram following.
**Mcalcetero**: What's his name?
**Bdclymer926**: Oh, there you go.
**Mcalcetero**: Edward Collins.
**Bdclymer926**: Edward Collins.
**Bdclymer926**: Never.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, yeah.
**Bdclymer926**: Which one's the one that says they do what we do?
**Bdclymer926**: I would think I would.
**Bdclymer926**: I would know of those people.
**Mcalcetero**: Rottweiler and the Edward Collins guy.
**Bdclymer926**: Edward Collins.
**Bdclymer926**: Edward Collins, yep.
**Mcalcetero**: Well, Paul guy.
**Bdclymer926**: Let's see.
**Bdclymer926**: Oh, here we go.
**Bdclymer926**: Collins Lambert, integrated.
**Bdclymer926**: Well, I don't know.
**Bdclymer926**: I don't know about him.
**Bdclymer926**: I have no idea.
**Bdclymer926**: Yeah, that's interesting.
**Bdclymer926**: No, I've never heard of these guys.
**Bdclymer926**: New Jersey, there's not.
**Bdclymer926**: There's not a lot of people that do what we do.
**Bdclymer926**: And the people that are usually suck at marketing and so, you know, it looks like they only have three people in their firm, though.
**Bdclymer926**: It's kind of weird.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah.
**Bdclymer926**: Also, it also says they deal with W2 employees, like professionals and executives.
**Bdclymer926**: We just do.
**Bdclymer926**: Entrepreneurs.
**Bdclymer926**: They Maybe.
**Mcalcetero**: I.
**Mcalcetero**: I don't know.
**Mcalcetero**: I didn't.
**Mcalcetero**: I didn't ask, to be honest.
**Mcalcetero**: I mean, he's not really in the running.
**Mcalcetero**: I wasn't.
**Mcalcetero**: He was cool guy and everything, but, you know, his fees were just outrageous.
**Mcalcetero**: It was like a hundred thousand dollar downstroke just to get in the door.
**Mcalcetero**: And I'm like, then I gotta pay on top of that, I was like.
**Bdclymer926**: Come on, you tell me we don't charge enough.
**Mcalcetero**: Brandon, I didn't hire him.
**Mcalcetero**: So you take that for what it is.
**Bdclymer926**: Yeah.
**Bdclymer926**: Well, I think the thing that I'm most proud of.
**Bdclymer926**: I don't know if you'll find anybody else that does this.
**Bdclymer926**: If you do, I'd love to hear about it.
**Bdclymer926**: Whether you hire us or not, is that we put our money where our mouth is.
**Bdclymer926**: We Literally write it into the engagement.
**Bdclymer926**: If we don't save you more than we, then you pay us, we refund the difference.
**Bdclymer926**: But yeah, you know, there's, there's probably people.
**Bdclymer926**: What was this other one?
**Bdclymer926**: Rottweiler.
**Bdclymer926**: Never heard of that either.
**Bdclymer926**: But they, they maybe do.
**Bdclymer926**: I, I don't know, maybe they do more maybe.
**Bdclymer926**: Oh, I talked to this guy before.
**Bdclymer926**: He was kind of a one man show.
**Bdclymer926**: I actually tried to hire him.
**Bdclymer926**: We got introduced somehow.
**Bdclymer926**: I remember him.
**Bdclymer926**: He, somebody told me his name and I was like, oh, I sound like it'd be good to work here.
**Bdclymer926**: But from what I understood, he was, he was like what I would call like a really good cpa.
**Bdclymer926**: Meaning that instead of just being like I fill out the forms with no brain activity, he would fill out the forms and think about it while doing it.
**Bdclymer926**: And you know, I, I prefer to work with CPAs like that.
**Bdclymer926**: So if you hired him, he, he doesn't do what we do and we don't do what he does.
**Bdclymer926**: But he's somebody that we could, we don't have a shared client, but we could probably work pretty well together.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah.
**Mcalcetero**: And I haven't, so I don't know.
**Mcalcetero**: I, I was supposed to be with him yesterday.
**Mcalcetero**: I had an emergency I had to fly out to, so we rescheduled for next week.
**Mcalcetero**: So.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, I haven't even heard a spiel yet.
**Mcalcetero**: So, you know, I, I, you know, I put out there what I was looking for.
**Mcalcetero**: And that's the other.
**Bdclymer926**: Who are the other ones?
**Bdclymer926**: Maria?
**Bclymer**: No, I couldn't find that one.
**Bclymer**: The only one I saw was W.
**Bclymer**: But is it with Daniel S.
**Bclymer**: That's the one we have.
**Mcalcetero**: What's the, what's the, what's the EOD guy or whatever.
**Mcalcetero**: What's this company?
**Mcalcetero**: What's his company called?
**Bclymer**: Once I can off, I found it right now.
**Bclymer**: His name is M.G.
**Bclymer**: the company name is MGO.
**Bclymer**: CPA.com.
**Bclymer**: that's the one.
**Bclymer**: MGOcPA.com.
**Bclymer**: mGO.
**Bclymer**: It's the tax NGO.
**Bdclymer926**: Like, like MGO.
**Bclymer**: Yes, I can.
**Mcalcetero**: Mike.
**Mcalcetero**: Mike Golf.
**Mcalcetero**: Oscar.
**Bclymer**: Correct.
**Bclymer**: MGO.
**Bclymer**: CPA.
**Mcalcetero**: That.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, that's the one.
**Bdclymer926**: Like M as in Michael.
**Bclymer**: I'll share with you.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Let me share it here in case you.
**Bdclymer926**: Oh, Michael.
**Bdclymer926**: Silvio.
**Mcalcetero**: That sounds right.
**Bdclymer926**: Is that his name?
**Bclymer**: Mg o cpa.com.
**Bdclymer926**: Yeah.
**Bdclymer926**: So this looks like a good sized, I don't know this firm, but this is what you would call like public accounting.
**Bdclymer926**: So this is like a, this would be like a good sized CPA firm.
**Bdclymer926**: So they would be able to do tax filings.
**Bdclymer926**: Tax prep, taps, tax compliance.
**Bdclymer926**: This firm could probably do the audit work you were asking about, Brandon.
**Bdclymer926**: It looks like they have some audit services.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, that, that's, these guys are doing the audit and then they, they reached out to me about their, the other side of things.
**Mcalcetero**: That's where they're, they wanted to introduce me to their group or I don't know if it's part of their company or sister company or what that is about, you know, the personal wealth and investment and everything.
**Bdclymer926**: Yeah.
**Bdclymer926**: Oh, I don't, I don't see that part.
**Mcalcetero**: And it may be a, a sister company.
**Mcalcetero**: I don't know.
**Mcalcetero**: I just, I said, yeah, I'm open to it.
**Bdclymer926**: Yeah, I, I mean it.
**Bdclymer926**: From what I'm looking at on their website, this would be a good firm that we, we could work with or would work with.
**Bdclymer926**: It looks like they have a lot of capabilities.
**Bdclymer926**: It doesn't look like they have construction as one of their industries that they highlight on here.
**Bdclymer926**: We do have.
**Bdclymer926**: Just so you know, if, if you're working with us, we have a great network of CPAs so we can help you find CPAs that, that we know, that we have worked with, that we know do good work, that we can make sure you're not getting overcharged, etc, things like that.
**Bdclymer926**: So we can bring those people to the table.
**Bdclymer926**: So yeah, I mean this looks like a good sized mgo, looks like a good sized CPA firm, but they wouldn't, we wouldn't replace them.
**Bdclymer926**: They wouldn't replace us.
**Bdclymer926**: That would be like a, that would be like we, we need somebody like that or a different person.
**Bdclymer926**: The Rottweiler Tax, we need somebody that we can work with that's going to do the compliance side, the prep and file and network, you know, so we have, we have plenty we could bring to the table, but they're, they're not going to do all the family office work.
**Bdclymer926**: The, you know, and most, the most financial advisors don't do the family office work either.
**Bdclymer926**: They just take your money and stick it in investments, which is really weird because your business is probably the best investment you ever had.
**Bdclymer926**: And so we want to build around that, not take it away from it.
**Mcalcetero**: You know, I mean my, it's funny, I think about like all my investments in like the past three years.
**Mcalcetero**: Like maybe a couple of them have made some money, but nothing compared to like what my primary business does.
**Mcalcetero**: I'm like, how do people like, you know, I've gone in as JV on some deals and like, oh, it would belly up for this.
**Mcalcetero**: I was like, how can you be so stupid?
**Mcalcetero**: Like, how does this work?
**Mcalcetero**: How do you not know how to make a dollar?
**Mcalcetero**: Like.
**Bdclymer926**: I'll tell you, man, the best investment you have is to invest in your company.
**Bdclymer926**: You know, I mean, yeah, you probably want to have some outside of your business for some fallback security.
**Bdclymer926**: But generally for most of our clients, 90% of their net worth is in their business and real estate.
**Bdclymer926**: And so the liquidity that you have outside of it is mainly about protecting that liquidity from creditors, protecting it from taxes, protecting it from lawsuit, protecting it from inflation.
**Bdclymer926**: And so it's more like cool if you get 5 or 10 million bucks outside.
**Bdclymer926**: Like, that money's not going to make you wealthy, but we need to make sure you never lose that money.
**Bdclymer926**: So if the whole business blew up, you'd have something to fall back on.
**Bdclymer926**: So we want to maintain purchasing power and grow it, at least at the rate of inflation.
**Bdclymer926**: But you don't want to take that capital and then expose it to risk that is equivalent to the risk in your business when you have more control over the risk in your business versus putting it in other people's companies that you have no control over.
**Mcalcetero**: Right.
**Mcalcetero**: There's this solar company that reached out to me.
**Mcalcetero**: It's one of our clients, and they want me to be a partner and, you know, so buy into it.
**Mcalcetero**: And one of the things I told them is that I don't buy in to businesses unless I'm, you know, actively helping manage it, which they wanted.
**Mcalcetero**: But yeah, I mean, my, my, one of my goals is to become like vertically integrated.
**Mcalcetero**: So I want to buy some, some subcontracting companies like Earthwork, Drywall, Concrete, because I understand, you know, one of the biggest downfalls in the subcontracting world is their project management.
**Mcalcetero**: Like it.
**Mcalcetero**: Just because usually these guys come out of the field, they don't have any real business acumen and they struggle on their office presence.
**Mcalcetero**: And so versus we have a very, you know, I, I have a very good knowledge of that, but.
**Mcalcetero**: And I think there's going to be a lot of those small, you know, doing $5 million a year businesses that are just going to close up.
**Mcalcetero**: And so that's what I really want to start acquiring and building those up, you know, bundle it, sell it.
**Bdclymer926**: Yeah, we should definitely have another call where we get Mark, our CFO that came from construction, that he was CFO of this billion and a half dollar general contractor in Texas.
**Bdclymer926**: You'd probably find a wealth of knowledge in having him on the team too.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, yeah, definitely.
**Bdclymer926**: You Know, to be able to give you that strategic advice that is, I mean, that's hard to get, you know.
**Mcalcetero**: Right.
**Bdclymer926**: So the people in construction, where he has been able to work with them, you know, as a resource to help think about, think through your contracts, think through your banking, think through your, you know, financials, given what he's learned from that company and help you take advantage of that.
**Bdclymer926**: I mean that's, that's probably more, that's probably just as valuable as everything else we talked about.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, for sure.
**Mcalcetero**: Cool.
**Mcalcetero**: Well, I, I appreciate time.
**Mcalcetero**: I, I do need to get on the road though.
**Bdclymer926**: Yeah.
**Mcalcetero**: I gotta go meet, I gotta go meet Bridget Chicago for a beer.
**Mcalcetero**: So, you know, like.
**Bdclymer926**: Yeah, there you go.
**Bdclymer926**: She's way more fun than me anyways.
**Bdclymer926**: What.
**Bdclymer926**: So where you guys are going to talk to a few other people.
**Bdclymer926**: That'd be great, you know, for having another call.
**Bdclymer926**: And we'll get Mark on that call.
**Bdclymer926**: I think he'd be a good resource for you to meet.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, yeah.
**Mcalcetero**: So I, we've got, I think we got some calls next week, Maria.
**Mcalcetero**: And, and then I would say, you know, probably for, for, you know, either last week of April or the first week of May, I'd like to get this audit done because, yeah, it's going to just give us way more of a better financial picture because, I mean, you know, we can talk but you know, he's going to be like, well, your finances aren't clear enough for me even give you any advice.
**Bdclymer926**: Yeah, Mark might have some insight for you there because he was an auditor at a big public accounting, so he worked at one of the like top 20 firms in the country as an auditor before going into the construction company.
**Bdclymer926**: So he might have some insight as how to navigate that or make it less painful, I don't know.
**Bdclymer926**: But yeah, let's have a meeting into April or whatever so you can get past those other things.
**Bdclymer926**: And right now, you know, we, we, probably the soonest we could start working for you would be June.
**Bdclymer926**: We just have, we have a lot more demand.
**Bdclymer926**: We probably have one or two new families call us every day and we can't take them all on.
**Bdclymer926**: And the ones that are a great fit, you know, we're probably two or three months out before starting.
**Bdclymer926**: So.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, I mean, just a heads up on that.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, I'm, no, I, I, I get it.
**Mcalcetero**: It takes time to get the right fit and honestly like to set something up that's going to go for 30 years.
**Mcalcetero**: It's foolish to expect to rush into it.
**Bdclymer926**: Right.
**Bdclymer926**: I'm just, I'm just wanting to set expectations.
**Bdclymer926**: So if you think, oh cool, let's do it, start right away, it's like, well, we have a little bit of a backlog.
**Mcalcetero**: But yeah, I, I'm fully, I'm fully prepared that in reality everything that I'm doing is setting up to really start in 2026.
**Bdclymer926**: Well, I mean, I think we're early enough in the year that we can make a real difference for 2025 on the income this year around income and tax and cash flow planning this year.
**Bdclymer926**: You know, so even if we start mid year, we'll still be able to have a real meaningful impact in this calendar year.
**Bdclymer926**: And then anticipating that Congress is going to give us some new tax laws that will go into effect next year, then we'll have to figure out what are those laws and what changes need to be made so that we can then optimize around those.
**Mcalcetero**: But Bridget, what's your tips now?
**Mcalcetero**: So you just.
**Mcalcetero**: Tips, 100% tips.
**Mcalcetero**: That's all we're doing now.
**Bdclymer926**: We'll do the job.
**Bdclymer926**: Actually, what I meant to say, Brandon, our fees a dollar.
**Bdclymer926**: But we would really appreciate 8,999amonth in tips.
**Mcalcetero**: Yes, exactly.
**Bdclymer926**: Bridget, what do we have at the end of April so we can put something down?
**Chad**: Right.
**Chad**: For the next call with you and Mark, I'm looking at Thursday, May 1st at 3pm Eastern.
**Chad**: Does that work for you, Brandon and Ria?
**Bclymer**: Can you repeat that?
**Bclymer**: What day?
**Chad**: Thursday, May 1, at 3pm Eastern.
**Bclymer**: Yes, it does.
**Chad**: Okay, great.
**Bdclymer926**: Sweet.
**Chad**: I will send.
**Bdclymer926**: All right, Brian, well, good meeting you again.
**Bdclymer926**: Maria, good meeting you.
**Bdclymer926**: Feel free to reach out in the meantime, if you can.
**Bdclymer926**: If you get any news on the audit or any updates, questions, feel free to shoot them over, let us know and otherwise we'll talk to you in a few weeks.
**Mcalcetero**: Awesome.
**Mcalcetero**: Sounds good.
**Mcalcetero**: Thanks, everybody.
**Bdclymer926**: All right, see you.
**Bclymer**: Thank you guys.
