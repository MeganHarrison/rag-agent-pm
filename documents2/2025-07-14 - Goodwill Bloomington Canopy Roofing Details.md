## Transcript
**Jeremy.lee**: Sam.
**Jcurtin**: Hey, Jeremy.
**Fireflies**: Hey, man.
**Jcurtin**: What's going on?
**Jcurtin**: Hey.
**Jeremy.lee**: We also have the framer on this meeting.
**Jeremy.lee**: He's working.
**Jeremy.lee**: Working on the parapet walls right now.
**Jeremy.lee**: So the gutter and downspout, I was thinking we put them.
**Jeremy.lee**: Is that in.
**Jeremy.lee**: In your guys's contract?
**Jeremy.lee**: Jeremy, I'm trying to think.
**Fireflies**: Hold on, let me close my door.
**Fireflies**: It's a little louder.
**Fireflies**: Okay.
**Fireflies**: So originally on that right side, I was under the impression we were doing a gutter the full length and that was going to be open where on that right side?
**Jcurtin**: Right here.
**Fireflies**: Correct.
**Fireflies**: So then what we talked about this morning is that you're going to go ahead and build a parapet wall now and put two scupper boxes in.
**Jeremy.lee**: That's what I was thinking would be the only way to drain it into the gutter.
**Fireflies**: So are you putting internal gutters in.
**Fireflies**: In the columns or something?
**Jcurtin**: No.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Fireflies**: So, yeah, I mean, I guess you have whatever option you want.
**Fireflies**: We had quoted it as putting a gutter along that full section and that being open so that.
**Fireflies**: That drained because you've got it sloping side.
**Fireflies**: Structurally.
**Jeremy.lee**: I don't think.
**Jeremy.lee**: I don't think this structure is sloped.
**Jeremy.lee**: This structure isn't slope, Jack, is it?
**Griffinkelly**: Yeah, that structure is sloped.
**Jeremy.lee**: Oh, it is.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Griffinkelly**: Yeah.
**Griffinkelly**: From the building to the outside, what would be the right side of the Prince?
**Griffinkelly**: Right.
**Griffinkelly**: There is about three inches of slope.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Fireflies**: So, yeah, that would be the ideal situation is.
**Fireflies**: Since it's stress otherwise from.
**Fireflies**: If you're looking at that right side, wherever you put those scupper boxes would be that we would have to put some tapered insulation to divert the water.
**Fireflies**: Otherwise it's just going to come.
**Fireflies**: You know, what's flowing in the line of those scupper boxes will find its way out, but the rest is just going to set up there.
**Jeremy.lee**: Yeah, you're talking about in this area.
**Jeremy.lee**: It's going to say absolutely.
**Fireflies**: It's going to sit there because there's no nowhere for it to go.
**Fireflies**: Nothing pushing it one way or the other to the scupper.
**Fireflies**: So the.
**Fireflies**: I, you know, from my standpoint, it's.
**Fireflies**: It's a.
**Fireflies**: It's less material, less work going in there if you don't build that parapet.
**Jcurtin**: And then.
**Fireflies**: We, you know, like I said, we already had to plan for that from what day?
**Fireflies**: Looking at Dave's quote was to put a gutter along that whole.
**Fireflies**: That whole side.
**Jeremy.lee**: Yeah.
**Jeremy.lee**: See, these drawings say they always showed a parapet right here.
**Jeremy.lee**: So that's, that's what we had.
**Jcurtin**: We had planned.
**Jcurtin**: We'll kick.
**Fireflies**: We'll kick David's ass.
**Griffinkelly**: Now, if you're putting gutters right there, I could be wrong, but wouldn't that be in the way of the stein that Goodwill wants to put on that?
**Fireflies**: If there's a sign there, you're absolutely right.
**Fireflies**: It would be.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Fireflies**: They're planning on putting their assignage on.
**Jcurtin**: That.
**Fireflies**: Elevation of that donations spot that, that canopy, then.
**Fireflies**: Yeah, we can't put a gutter there for sure.
**Fireflies**: So then do we just want to put scuppers in above the each column with a downspout coming off so it's.
**Jeremy.lee**: Not, you know, down the column?
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jeremy.lee**: Is that, is that something easy for you?
**Fireflies**: Yeah, we can do that.
**Fireflies**: I need to go back and look and see what David's got in numbers wise, make sure that we're, you know, that we're good on that since we have to add some tapered insulation.
**Fireflies**: But as far as the gutters versus the scupper boxes, that's not going to be a monetarily any difference.
**Fireflies**: I think we're pretty good on the tapered insulation too, so.
**Fireflies**: But I'll double check how from corner to corner, what are we talking is that 18ft, 20ft, 75ft?
**Griffinkelly**: Which corner are you talking about?
**Fireflies**: Front to back?
**Fireflies**: Are we.
**Griffinkelly**: How long is that from the building to the outside?
**Griffinkelly**: I believe it was opposite directions.
**Griffinkelly**: Other direction.
**Griffinkelly**: I think that was somewhere in the neighborhood of 30ft.
**Fireflies**: Okay, so we talking about.
**Fireflies**: Do you know where the columns are?
**Fireflies**: They about three or four feet in.
**Griffinkelly**: I would say closer to three feet if I had to guess.
**Fireflies**: If, if you could just get me like that exact measurement.
**Fireflies**: I can figure.
**Jeremy.lee**: I can send the submittal to you if that works.
**Fireflies**: That's perfect.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, send me that.
**Fireflies**: And I'll figure it up.
**Fireflies**: I'll figure out what we need.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Fireflies**: I mean, just a couple Q panels, probably three or four.
**Jeremy.lee**: That, that's an epis column.
**Jeremy.lee**: So you would just attach the downspouts to the EF es to the E. Fish.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jeremy.lee**: Yeah, I guess it.
**Jeremy.lee**: Yeah, it wouldn't affect his, his framing at all.
**Jcurtin**: No, I'm not.
**Jeremy.lee**: How was your framing in that location, Griffin, for the ceiling?
**Jeremy.lee**: Griffin.
**Griffinkelly**: Oh, sorry.
**Griffinkelly**: I was muted.
**Griffinkelly**: The lower portion of the parapet wall will return to about 6 inches inside of those columns and then it'll step up to the ceiling.
**Griffinkelly**: So if you're gonna put your downspouts on the columns, it shouldn't be in our way.
**Griffinkelly**: The only thing, we'll have to just cut around it when we do the dense glass on the bottom.
**Fireflies**: So why don't we.
**Fireflies**: Why don't we wait until you're totally done with those columns before we come and put those downspouts in?
**Fireflies**: We can put the scuppers in and the collector boxes, but wait until we got something to attach to a finished product.
**Fireflies**: That way we're not in the way and screwing anything up.
**Fireflies**: Yeah.
**Griffinkelly**: If you guys are fine with cutting your own hole out for it, then that's fine.
**Fireflies**: I prefer you cut the hole.
**Griffinkelly**: Yeah, I. I just don't know when that finished product would be, if we're still going to be on site or not.
**Fireflies**: Are you talking about the hole for the scupper box or.
**Griffinkelly**: For your downspouts?
**Griffinkelly**: I thought that's what we were referring.
**Fireflies**: Yeah, no, we'll be, we'll be fine.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jeremy.lee**: Then would we need some type of drain on the roof or.
**Jeremy.lee**: How do you usually do that, Jeremy?
**Fireflies**: Well, if it's all drained into that, that one wall, then those scuppers will, you know, shove the water out.
**Fireflies**: There'll be a collector box then on the outside with the downspout attached to it.
**Fireflies**: You don't need any dreams.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jeremy.lee**: So you're gonna have.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jeremy.lee**: Scuppers.
**Fireflies**: Above each.
**Jcurtin**: That way.
**Fireflies**: Otherwise if you're gonna have a downspout coming off that we don't have anything to attach to.
**Fireflies**: It's gonna have to come off of the line of the, the columns.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jeremy.lee**: So you would, you would have them right here and then it would come around and attach to the column.
**Fireflies**: Well, yeah, it'll.
**Fireflies**: It'll have to come down probably 45 back towards the column attached to it and down.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jeremy.lee**: And does it need to be specific sizes with his framing, Griffin's framing for the scuppers.
**Fireflies**: Let me talk to Jason and get you those dimensions.
**Fireflies**: He's our sheet metal guy.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Fireflies**: Matter of fact, he just called it a second ago, so I gotta call him back.
**Fireflies**: So I'll get that information from him as we're.
**Jeremy.lee**: And then I saw you show blocking right here for the, for the coping.
**Fireflies**: Yeah, just something.
**Fireflies**: I mean, I'm sure his framing is gonna.
**Fireflies**: Is he using wood or aluminum on the.
**Jeremy.lee**: Yeah, it's okay.
**Griffinkelly**: Yeah, we'll have.
**Griffinkelly**: It'll be metal track on the top and then typically we'll put either what we've got on.
**Griffinkelly**: On site would be weather treated plywood.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Fireflies**: Well, as long as we've got just something to screw the.
**Fireflies**: Yeah.
**Fireflies**: Whether it's aluminum or it's wood, it's really not going to matter.
**Fireflies**: We just need something to anchor to.
**Griffinkelly**: So realistically you don't really require any blocking on the top.
**Fireflies**: Well, if you're.
**Fireflies**: If it's aluminum studs, you're going to have the aluminum up there, right?
**Fireflies**: Yeah.
**Griffinkelly**: I mean, it's.
**Fireflies**: It's gonna come up and over the studs.
**Griffinkelly**: Yes.
**Fireflies**: Yeah.
**Fireflies**: So we can anchor to that.
**Fireflies**: That's fine.
**Fireflies**: It doesn't have to.
**Griffinkelly**: Okay, so.
**Griffinkelly**: So we won't do any wood then, and we'll just leave it as the metal.
**Fireflies**: Yeah, that'll work for us.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jeremy.lee**: And then this.
**Jeremy.lee**: Dude, do you just drill.
**Jeremy.lee**: Drill a hole, Jeremy?
**Fireflies**: Yeah, I just gotta cut in and it'll.
**Fireflies**: That whole metal run all the way inside the whole length.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jeremy.lee**: Yeah, I think that that should work.
**Fireflies**: Yeah, I figured that was kind of our best.
**Fireflies**: I mean, that's a little under.
**Fireflies**: Under exaggerated because it's going to have to come back at a better angle with the, with the depth of that EFIs.
**Fireflies**: But that gives us, you know, a base scenario of how it's going to be.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jeremy.lee**: And then other than the size of the scupper openings, is.
**Jeremy.lee**: Is there anything you can think of, Griffin, that you would need?
**Fireflies**: I need to get you.
**Fireflies**: Once I figure out.
**Fireflies**: So I think we're putting an inch and a half or two inch base layer, and then I think you're probably looking at another two and a half.
**Fireflies**: So I need to get.
**Fireflies**: Before we start cutting any scupper box openings, I need to get that thickness of that insulation there so we know that we're not.
**Fireflies**: The scuffer is not, you know, too high or too low.
**Griffinkelly**: Yeah, that's.
**Griffinkelly**: That's exactly what I was going to say.
**Griffinkelly**: Just give me an elevation for it and a size and we'll be good.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jeremy.lee**: And what.
**Jeremy.lee**: When are you framing that spot proofing?
**Griffinkelly**: We'll be framing it later today, so if you can get it to me tomorrow, early tomorrow or even the next day, we could.
**Fireflies**: What's your.
**Fireflies**: What's your cell number?
**Griffinkelly**: It is 31 7.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Griffinkelly**: 551 8.
**Griffinkelly**: 1969.
**Jcurtin**: All right, I'll.
**Jcurtin**: I'll.
**Fireflies**: I'll text you a size here in the next hour.
**Griffinkelly**: Okay, sounds good.
**Griffinkelly**: And you, I assume you don't need any blocking for that either?
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Griffinkelly**: Okay, sounds good.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jeremy.lee**: I appreciate the help, Jeremy.
**Fireflies**: No problem, guys.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: All right.
