**Adelgado**: That's it.
**Speaker 1**: Perfect.
**Speaker 1**: Sounds great.
**Adelgado**: Yeah.
**Adelgado**: So let's see here.
**Adelgado**: I'm going to share my screen.
**Speaker 1**: Perfect.
**Adelgado**: And what.
**Adelgado**: So which job was Brandon have any work on?
**Speaker 1**: Yes, he told me about the Kentucky project.
**Adelgado**: Oh yeah?
**Adelgado**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: He.
**Speaker 1**: He wants, he wants a overlay plan because he have some drawings and you know.
**Speaker 1**: Well, he wants to know if he.
**Speaker 1**: Well, the project, the preliminary, the preliminary project would be possible.
**Adelgado**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Yes.
**Adelgado**: Good.
**Adelgado**: Are you liking things so far?
**Speaker 1**: What?
**Speaker 1**: I didn't hear you.
**Adelgado**: I said you like everything so far.
**Speaker 1**: I know.
**Adelgado**: It's just been a day.
**Adelgado**: A couple days.
**Speaker 1**: Yes.
**Adelgado**: Yeah, good deal.
**Adelgado**: And you're able to access his, his CAD AutoCAD account.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Here we will going to buy a full license of autocad because yesterday I want to download the full version.
**Speaker 1**: But we have also the, the light version.
**Adelgado**: Yeah, that's what I was thinking when I looked at it.
**Adelgado**: You don't have all the functions.
**Adelgado**: You can't go draw projects.
**Adelgado**: You just look at it.
**Speaker 1**: Exactly.
**Speaker 1**: Because I need to geolocate the drawing and.
**Speaker 1**: Well, if we want to have a good scale of the drawing, you know.
**Adelgado**: Yeah, okay, great.
**Adelgado**: Yeah, because we got so much.
**Adelgado**: It's going to be a very, very helpful so on here.
**Adelgado**: Did you, Did Maria show you notion?
**Speaker 1**: No.
**Speaker 1**: Well, I, No, I have never seen this chart.
**Adelgado**: Okay, so notion is what.
**Adelgado**: You know, we tried using several things to just keep track of all the jobs and we, you know, they've found this to be, you know, the easiest way to.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, perfect.
**Adelgado**: Try and keep it all together.
**Adelgado**: So you do have like the one drive right where you.
**Adelgado**: We got folders.
**Speaker 1**: Yes, I have all the folders.
**Speaker 1**: Well, 24, 25 and estimating.
**Adelgado**: Yeah, so like if you look.
**Adelgado**: Estimating.
**Adelgado**: So if you look at estimating here.
**Speaker 1**: In this folder, Is all the breaks that we are estimating.
**Speaker 1**: No.
**Adelgado**: Yeah, well, it's ones that are currently.
**Adelgado**: They're either.
**Adelgado**: They've been estimated and they're waiting on either approval or the job goes away or else it's something we're actively estimating.
**Adelgado**: So that's why this one like 3151 Morrison street so that's this job right up here.
**Adelgado**: And we got Goodwill Sloan re Roof.
**Adelgado**: Goodwill, Sloan Re Roof.
**Adelgado**: This has a different date.
**Adelgado**: These dates should be the same, but it's not critical there.
**Adelgado**: Then there's Turner Townhome.
**Adelgado**: So that's another job.
**Adelgado**: That's this one here that I'd like to.
**Adelgado**: They sent us the drawings but there's a few things we'd like to.
**Adelgado**: We think could make it more efficient, work a little better and just make a little more sense.
**Adelgado**: So I'll send you.
**Adelgado**: I think.
**Adelgado**: I don't know if we got this one.
**Adelgado**: Yeah, these drawings are saved in here.
**Adelgado**: Okay, so.
**Adelgado**: So that's how like when you know you can access this folder.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: Yeah.
**Adelgado**: You have access, correct?
**Speaker 1**: Yes, I have access, correct.
**Adelgado**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: So this Goodwill Foundations.
**Adelgado**: That one we had another architect already do some drawings on it.
**Adelgado**: But this is one of the ones that Glenn.
**Adelgado**: So this is where.
**Adelgado**: Let's minimize this.
**Adelgado**: So Goodwill Foundations estimator.
**Adelgado**: So I'll go in here ad there you are.
**Adelgado**: So that's you.
**Adelgado**: And now you'll get a notification if you look at your email and see if you got an email from Notion stating something's changed and put in your cord.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: I haven't received yet, but.
**Adelgado**: Glenn, he's going to be the project manager.
**Adelgado**: I just put him in there.
**Speaker 1**: Notion Team.
**Speaker 1**: Perfect.
**Adelgado**: Did you get it?
**Speaker 1**: Yes, I get it.
**Adelgado**: So now if you click on that link, it'll take you to this page.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: I finished drawing from book.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: And it takes a little.
**Adelgado**: I'm still learning how to navigate this because there's like on this left hand side there's all these different things, but it's really this, this one here.
**Adelgado**: Alito Group.
**Adelgado**: Like if you click on that, that's where all the most of the stuff you'll be okay looking at will be.
**Adelgado**: So we got you on that one.
**Adelgado**: So that's one of them.
**Adelgado**: That's Goodwill Foundations.
**Adelgado**: Yep.
**Adelgado**: Then Turner Townhomes.
**Adelgado**: So this PM right now is going to be me estimator that someone have you help with this one.
**Adelgado**: A D put you on that one.
**Adelgado**: This Goodwill Sloan Reroof.

**Speaker 1**: Yes.
**Adelgado**: I watch it.
**Adelgado**: Yeah.
**Adelgado**: Were you able to find or that's what you wanted to look at?
**Adelgado**: Was the building connected?
**Speaker 1**: Yes, I, I look some.
**Speaker 1**: Well, I was review all the bit packages.
**Speaker 1**: Exactly.
**Speaker 1**: All the bit package of this, of this project.
**Adelgado**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: So.
**Adelgado**: And I haven't used building connected a lot.
**Adelgado**: I only use it just the function to find subcontractors in the area.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: So if you want to share your screen, show me what you.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, I will show you.
**Speaker 1**: I will.
**Speaker 1**: This is this one Projects.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: You could watch my screen.
**Adelgado**: Yep, I can see your screen.
**Speaker 1**: Perfect.
**Adelgado**: So I don't see re roof.
**Adelgado**: I don't know what order these are put in.
**Speaker 1**: I, I think it's Lamington.
**Adelgado**: No, that's not it.
**Speaker 1**: Nope.
**Adelgado**: Nope.
**Adelgado**: Because I, it's, it's Goodwill.
**Adelgado**: Sloan Reroof.
**Adelgado**: So it probably hasn't been created if you didn't create it.
**Speaker 1**: No.
**Speaker 1**: Because here in Goodwill Bloomington, I keep roofing.
**Speaker 1**: During roofing, I, I, I'm seeing.
**Adelgado**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Proposal.
**Adelgado**: But that's for the roofing job they're doing there.
**Speaker 1**: Exactly.
**Speaker 1**: Well, yeah.
**Adelgado**: So let's create a new job.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: Cancel that.
**Adelgado**: Close that.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, close that.
**Speaker 1**: Perfect.
**Adelgado**: And then just go to projects.

**Speaker 1**: I will need new user username or something like that.
**Speaker 1**: Because I will do it with the profile of Brandon.
**Adelgado**: That's fine.
**Adelgado**: That's fine.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, perfect.
**Speaker 1**: And you project here.
**Adelgado**: Yeah, we just will get Maria to set you up with your own account.
**Adelgado**: But so the number is 25- dash-03-24.
**Adelgado**: And then the name is Goodwill or just GW Capital.
**Adelgado**: Capital G capital W space.
**Adelgado**: Then Sloan S L, O A N E.
**Adelgado**: Sloane.
**Adelgado**: Yeah.
**Adelgado**: Let's put an E on the end.
**Adelgado**: After the end.

**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Is this winner?
**Adelgado**: Yeah, I don't know.
**Adelgado**: It's.
**Adelgado**: There's an E on the end, I think.
**Adelgado**: And that was just maybe type wrong.
**Adelgado**: But that's fine.
**Adelgado**: You put as that too.
**Adelgado**: Doesn't matter.
**Adelgado**: It'll just look a little different in notion.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: Re roof.
**Adelgado**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: And then select date bids do.
**Adelgado**: So we'll put this at.
**Adelgado**: We'll just put it as like next Tuesday.
**Speaker 1**: Next Tuesday.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: And then for location, the location of this project.
**Adelgado**: Let me find that, Let me get the address.
**Adelgado**: Well, it's, it's the US you could have left that alone.
**Adelgado**: Definitely not India.
**Adelgado**: Just delete that.
**Adelgado**: It should go back to the U.S.
**Adelgado**: okay, it's so the location, it starts out with the United States.
**Adelgado**: There we go.
**Adelgado**: And then so here's the address.
**Adelgado**: So let me get you this address of the job.
**Speaker 1**: Perfect.
**Adelgado**: Let.
**Adelgado**: So like we did a project there.
**Adelgado**: It finished up last year.
**Adelgado**: It's called.
**Adelgado**: It's in the 2023 folder but it's.
**Adelgado**: Oh, there is no E in it.
**Adelgado**: But this is the address.
**Adelgado**: It's 2251 Sloan Avenue S L O A N.
**Speaker 1**: Avenue.
**Speaker 1**: In Depth Indiana.
**Adelgado**: Yeah, right there.
**Adelgado**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: And then I don't know that we need any of that.
**Adelgado**: There is no architect.
**Adelgado**: And then in the description install new or reroof portions of existing building.
**Adelgado**: And then you can put price option for TPO or match existing hitomus roof type.
**Adelgado**: It's B I T O U M I N O U S I think.
**Speaker 1**: B I T.
**Adelgado**: Yeah.
**Adelgado**: Did you work.
**Adelgado**: You said you were doing like work for a roofing company for a while.
**Adelgado**: I don't know what kind of roof systems the do they have just tpo, you know, Just tpo.
**Adelgado**: Yeah.
**Adelgado**: B I T U M I N O U S by two minnows.
**Speaker 1**: Exactly.
**Adelgado**: Okay, so then see I wanted this project invite only.
**Adelgado**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: And this doesn't matter.
**Adelgado**: So now most of this I think you can leave blank because then we'll just search for subs in that area.
**Adelgado**: We're just looking for roofers.
**Speaker 1**: I match this.
**Adelgado**: No, I just.
**Speaker 1**: I want the projecting to invite only.
**Adelgado**: Yeah, yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: And then is there anything else on the bottom of the screen?
**Speaker 1**: Private information.
**Speaker 1**: And that's all.
**Adelgado**: Yeah.
**Adelgado**: So just create a project.
**Speaker 1**: Create a project.
**Speaker 1**: Tell TM it's it's correct or what is it about the bits too?
**Adelgado**: It won't let you save it without changing that.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: And we create it.
**Adelgado**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: We don't need nothing about non disclosure and this one.
**Adelgado**: No, no.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: No.
**Adelgado**: Yeah.
**Adelgado**: We're.
**Adelgado**: We're simply using this to find subs.
**Adelgado**: That's all.
**Adelgado**: We won't.
**Adelgado**: We won't have them.
**Adelgado**: You won't, you know, approach them through this and they got your phone number set up.
**Adelgado**: Is that all good to go?
**Speaker 1**: Yes, I have my.
**Speaker 1**: My new number.
**Speaker 1**: I will share you a definition.
**Speaker 1**: Yes.
**Adelgado**: Yeah, Maria sent it over to me.
**Adelgado**: I think I got it.
**Adelgado**: I'll add that to your contact and.
**Speaker 1**: Perfect.
**Adelgado**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: All right.
**Adelgado**: So now if we go to this job and we go.
**Adelgado**: I think it's.
**Adelgado**: Let's see bid packages.
**Adelgado**: So we only going to have one which is for new bid package.
**Adelgado**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: I don't know if it makes sense to do just 07 since it's Division 7 going to be roofing.
**Adelgado**: Here we go.
**Adelgado**: The lead will be you.
**Adelgado**: I don't Know if you can change that or not on the lead.
**Adelgado**: Oh, you're not in here.
**Adelgado**: So that's fine.
**Adelgado**: Return.
**Adelgado**: Change it to me so he doesn't.
**Adelgado**: Brandon doesn't get bombarded with this stuff.
**Adelgado**: Okay, we go estimated cost.
**Adelgado**: I don't know.
**Adelgado**: Okay, so now, okay, go up and just hit save and bidders and search import or add companies.
**Adelgado**: So here we got all these companies.
**Adelgado**: So.
**Adelgado**: So Indie rooftop.
**Adelgado**: So like you can check them.
**Adelgado**: We'll add those like the owner and.
**Speaker 1**: The owner operator both.
**Adelgado**: Yeah, we'll just add.
**Adelgado**: Okay, add and then be Brown Horning Roofing.
**Adelgado**: That sounds like a roofer.
**Adelgado**: You can add them.
**Adelgado**: Diversified roofing.
**Adelgado**: That's a good one.
**Adelgado**: Cnc.
**Adelgado**: So there's a bunch of these roofing Boltech and then eats.
**Speaker 1**: Growth squared.
**Adelgado**: Quality.
**Adelgado**: I think that's the company we're using we got a bid for on the tpo.
**Adelgado**: I'm not mistaken.
**Adelgado**: Look here.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: Yeah, quality.
**Adelgado**: So they've already bid it and they bid.
**Adelgado**: But they only do tpo.
**Adelgado**: That's why you'll have to.
**Adelgado**: Let's just say we.
**Adelgado**: How many do we got selected?
**Speaker 1**: We got 10.
**Adelgado**: Company solution.
**Adelgado**: Okay, so if you go through these and I, you know, again, I don't know if there's a better way, but you can.
**Adelgado**: So if you click on I think the star maybe by their name.
**Adelgado**: If it shows you their contact info.
**Adelgado**: Like if you go to the right side, it just means they're primary contacts.
**Speaker 1**: Yes.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, click on that.
**Adelgado**: So my roof care give you the address.
**Adelgado**: It's looking for a phone number in here somewhere and we're searching whatnot.
**Adelgado**: And then you can read through it too and say do they do modified bit roof or is it, you know what kind of roofing systems they do?
**Adelgado**: Does it say on here?
**Adelgado**: Not really, no.
**Adelgado**: So yeah, if it's nothing.
**Adelgado**: Yeah, just quality roofing service.
**Adelgado**: So they're the ones who quoted it.
**Adelgado**: Yeah, they gave us a quote.
**Speaker 1**: Yes.
**Adelgado**: But now you got their name.
**Adelgado**: So you can click on their website.
**Adelgado**: See that number on top?
**Adelgado**: We already have quality roofing because they bid the tpo.
**Adelgado**: So but all the other companies just click on their website, get the phone number, call them up.
**Adelgado**: You know, you can ask for that person.
**Adelgado**: This listed as either their estimator.
**Adelgado**: Like if you get out of this X out of this one, I call these, you know, they give you, you know, summer senior estimator.
**Adelgado**: Estimator.
**Adelgado**: Estimator.
**Adelgado**: So you can just go to their website, find the number and then ask for whichever person David Rice or Jason.
**Speaker 1**: Bishop and then I will ask if they made this.
**Speaker 1**: This work.
**Speaker 1**: No.
**Adelgado**: Well, quality roofing has already bid it.
**Adelgado**: But anyone else?
**Adelgado**: Yeah, yeah, you just simple.
**Adelgado**: Whatever person there.
**Adelgado**: Can I speak to this person?
**Adelgado**: And.
**Speaker 1**: Well, I have a phone and I could call it now with this phone.
**Adelgado**: There you go.
**Adelgado**: Yeah.
**Adelgado**: So you should call that phone number.
**Adelgado**: Yep.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: And you just tell them, my name's Andres.
**Adelgado**: I work with Alito Group.
**Adelgado**: We have a project we need to reroof.
**Adelgado**: It's an existing building we built out for goodwill.
**Adelgado**: The section that they're under in that building, they want a new roof put on.
**Adelgado**: It's existing, is some sort of Bitumas roof.
**Adelgado**: And we just need a price to replace it with either TPO or go back and you know, I guess ask them first off, did they do anything other than tpo, you know, if they do this type of roof and then say, well, we need a price to re roof to match existing and then a price to re roof with.
**Adelgado**: With new.
**Adelgado**: And you know that one, the aerial.
**Adelgado**: Did you look at that aerial that they had in the file yesterday?
**Adelgado**: No.
**Adelgado**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Quality roofing quote are two types of roof.
**Adelgado**: No.
**Adelgado**: Yeah.
**Adelgado**: So let me show you my screen here.
**Speaker 1**: Yes.
**Adelgado**: So like, this is the area you can re roof with anything without changing anything.
**Adelgado**: And then this little area here, you'd have to build a little parapet wall, put a flat, you know, coping cap on it just to separate it to put TPO here if needed.
**Adelgado**: But in every.
**Adelgado**: Do you have Google Earth?
**Adelgado**: You have a little stuff like that.
**Adelgado**: So if you pull up Google Earth, I'll let you share your screen.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: Right.
**Adelgado**: And then if you go to type in the 2251 Sloan Ave.
**Adelgado**: Or Sloan SL O A N.
**Adelgado**: Oh, they do it backwards.
**Adelgado**: Okay, think you have to like here, you have to put Sloan first S L O A N.
**Adelgado**: And there is no E on it.
**Adelgado**: You put.
**Adelgado**: You got to go to Sloan Avenue.
**Adelgado**: Yeah, there you go.
**Adelgado**: One thing you have to get used to.
**Adelgado**: And I couldn't, you know, I tried to learn Spanish and Italian and you know how it's like.
**Adelgado**: There's.
**Adelgado**: The sentence structure is like different.
**Speaker 1**: Interesting.
**Speaker 1**: I will.
**Adelgado**: So here is.
**Adelgado**: Yeah, here's the same thing.
**Adelgado**: So if it's.
**Adelgado**: If it was Sloan street, it'd be Sloan street, not Street, Sloan.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: Yeah.
**Adelgado**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: So this is that building.
**Adelgado**: And if you.
**Adelgado**: So that you can now compare it to that aerial we had, you can see that it's that, you know, this is basically upside down.
**Adelgado**: But I can flip this over, Flip this over, rotate pages.
**Adelgado**: Right.
**Adelgado**: So here I'm Going to show you my screen.
**Speaker 1**: Perfect.
**Adelgado**: Nice.
**Adelgado**: So you see how I just flipped that photo?
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: You see that?
**Adelgado**: Now it matches the building.
**Adelgado**: It's just this section.
**Speaker 1**: It's just that section, right?
**Adelgado**: Yep.
**Adelgado**: So this, the red line on the outside is the entirety of their space below.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: This line here is showing like there's these little parapet walls.
**Adelgado**: So you know, with the roof system, if it's two different roof systems, you can't just butt them together.
**Adelgado**: You have to go up a wall and then you can terminate it under the.
**Adelgado**: The coping cap, the cap on top of the wall.
**Adelgado**: Because then you can have two different type of roofs.
**Adelgado**: Whereas in this case, like this is all one big open area.
**Adelgado**: So they would have to go in and build a little parapet wall, you know, two by sixes or whatever wood to build up a little wall.
**Adelgado**: And then they build a new cap and that way they could have.
**Adelgado**: If they do switch to tpo, then it'd be out here and then you can see like there's these.
**Adelgado**: This is an older photo.
**Adelgado**: It doesn't have the new rooftop units we added for their space.
**Adelgado**: So it doesn't really show them all.
**Adelgado**: They would have to go out and make a site visit which we can coordinate if they need to look at it.
**Adelgado**: But this is the space so you can take.
**Adelgado**: And like, if you go back to share your screen, do you have, you know what a.
**Adelgado**: The snipping tool is?
**Speaker 1**: Yes.
**Adelgado**: So you can take this building and take a snapshot of that.
**Adelgado**: You can make your own drawing that's more clear, you know, from what they did.
**Adelgado**: So are you able to scale and get the actual dimensions off of this building?
**Speaker 1**: Yes, I could enter to that.
**Speaker 1**: I just need to.
**Speaker 1**: I will save this image.
**Speaker 1**: This drawing.
**Adelgado**: Will.
**Speaker 1**: I'm opening octocat and I will put in there the raster image.
**Adelgado**: You are awesome, Mike.
**Speaker 1**: What?
**Adelgado**: I said you're awesome.
**Adelgado**: I mean, I.
**Adelgado**: I wish I could do what you do.
**Adelgado**: So like, I'm a little envious.
**Adelgado**: But this is great.
**Adelgado**: Turn this into AutoCAD.
**Adelgado**: It's like.
**Adelgado**: That's awesome.
**Speaker 1**: Ah, don't worry.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, perfect.
**Speaker 1**: And I'm image download.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Open this and I will just have the area now.
**Speaker 1**: I could do it too with review of Lubim or.
**Speaker 1**: Or do you think it's better?
**Speaker 1**: It's better.
**Adelgado**: This would be awesome because like.
**Adelgado**: So you can draw out the out print of this.
**Speaker 1**: Exactly.
**Adelgado**: Then you could draw in the new parapet wall that they would need to add to change it to tpo.
**Speaker 1**: Yes.
**Speaker 1**: I don't remember this Is the.
**Adelgado**: The other wall?
**Adelgado**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Is this side?
**Speaker 1**: No.
**Adelgado**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Let me share here again please because I need.
**Adelgado**: I'm gonna flip this around so it matches your drawing here.
**Speaker 1**: Perfect.
**Speaker 1**: Yes.
**Adelgado**: Yeah.
**Adelgado**: So like it's this side.
**Adelgado**: Yeah.
**Adelgado**: Below their space.
**Adelgado**: Yeah.
**Adelgado**: So it's that.
**Adelgado**: That one you had.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Do you have the measures of this one?
**Adelgado**: Let me see here.
**Speaker 1**: It could be.
**Speaker 1**: I don't know.
**Speaker 1**: I mean if it's.
**Adelgado**: Well, I can tell you see share.
**Adelgado**: Here we go.
**Adelgado**: So I can get you a reference I think.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: Need to find something like this is that space below.
**Adelgado**: I wonder if you could take.
**Adelgado**: If I send you the.
**Adelgado**: Or these drawings are in that folder.
**Adelgado**: Could you cut this out, clip it over top of the aerial view and then you could.
**Adelgado**: You would know what you'd have like a basis to scale off of.
**Adelgado**: Does that make sense?
**Speaker 1**: Yes, make me sense.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: I just.
**Speaker 1**: Which one is.
**Adelgado**: So if you let me email this to you.
**Speaker 1**: This.
**Adelgado**: Let me get a cleaned up version of this.
**Adelgado**: Now we're doing what I do.
**Adelgado**: That's the only thing I can do.
**Adelgado**: I just bluebeam everything.
**Adelgado**: Try and see here.
**Adelgado**: So we want to go to 2023.
**Adelgado**: Did they give you access to all the folders or just 24 and 25?
**Speaker 1**: Just 24 and 25.
**Adelgado**: All right.
**Adelgado**: So I'm going share this in case afterwards you need some more info.
**Adelgado**: There we go.
**Adelgado**: Let email you this sheet it.
**Adelgado**: All right.
**Adelgado**: So I just sent you an email with that.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: The correct scale then.
**Adelgado**: All right.
**Adelgado**: I want to watch what you're doing.
**Speaker 1**: Okay well here this is the correct.
**Speaker 1**: Or is just this there?
**Adelgado**: It's that one.
**Adelgado**: That other is a link to that whole job folder.
**Speaker 1**: Ah, perfect.
**Adelgado**: For the project we did.
**Adelgado**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: We have here.
**Speaker 1**: I just need to locate me.
**Speaker 1**: You know.
**Speaker 1**: Where am I The past.
**Adelgado**: So this is the outside of the building.
**Adelgado**: These those two sides, the bottom side and the right hand side.
**Adelgado**: Is that the lower wall and what would be west on the plan?
**Adelgado**: And so you see where these bathrooms are right there on the top left?
**Speaker 1**: Yes.
**Adelgado**: That's the area that's outside of that one parapet wall that we would need to add.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: To roof it.
**Adelgado**: So if it makes sense.
**Adelgado**: Hey there.
**Adelgado**: I'm good.
**Adelgado**: How about yourself?
**Adelgado**: Yeah, hold on one second.
**Adelgado**: Hey Andres, I'll let you work on that for a minute if you get.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Don't worry, I'm here.
**Adelgado**: All right.
**Adelgado**: Thanks.
**Speaker 1**: Thank you.
**Speaker 1**: That I need to reroute lost Sa it here it.
**Adelgado**: I'm back.
**Adelgado**: Andre.
**Speaker 1**: I am trying to scale the.
**Speaker 1**: Do you hear me?
**Adelgado**: Yep.
**Adelgado**: Yeah.
**Adelgado**: I can hear you.
**Speaker 1**: Perfect.
**Speaker 1**: Reference 24.
**Adelgado**: You can 90 degrees, like, to the right.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: There you go.
**Adelgado**: Now it should fit right over top of that.
**Adelgado**: Oh, yeah, you gotta move it down a bit.
**Speaker 1**: Exactly.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, okay.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: So it's barely out on that other roof.
**Speaker 1**: So which area?
**Adelgado**: The one where we have to cross over the wall that, you know, for the.
**Adelgado**: Like, if your hand, like.
**Adelgado**: Oh, no.
**Speaker 1**: Move it.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: There we go.
**Adelgado**: And so right where your hand is, it's just that little section that's past that retaining wall.
**Adelgado**: Is that right there?
**Adelgado**: Yeah, that's it.
**Speaker 1**: Just this section.
**Adelgado**: Well, you can see, like, there is a.
**Adelgado**: There's a parapet like, that runs up and down the page from the corner of that green area inside the building straight down.
**Adelgado**: And then it's just that little bit of a section that's on the right side of that.
**Adelgado**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Here.
**Adelgado**: Yeah.
**Adelgado**: Yep.
**Adelgado**: Yeah, it's only.
**Speaker 1**: Well, could you show me?
**Speaker 1**: I.
**Speaker 1**: It's.
**Speaker 1**: Is this.
**Speaker 1**: This area too?
**Speaker 1**: No.
**Adelgado**: Nope.
**Speaker 1**: Nope.
**Adelgado**: No, it looks.
**Adelgado**: Yeah.
**Adelgado**: So that.
**Adelgado**: So we're doing a little more.
**Adelgado**: That's not in their space, but it doesn't.
**Adelgado**: We're just going to go over to that parapet wall because it's existing.
**Adelgado**: So they're going to roof a little bit of the building that's not theirs.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: We'll open the drawing.
**Adelgado**: Yeah.
**Adelgado**: So they had it a little bigger than it's going to end up being.
**Adelgado**: And honestly, I wouldn't.
**Adelgado**: I.
**Adelgado**: I wouldn't do that whole area either.
**Adelgado**: Like, they have it.
**Adelgado**: You know, if you can just put a.
**Adelgado**: A wall above the lower wall, the walls that are below.
**Speaker 1**: Huh.
**Adelgado**: You technically will have a new roof above their space.
**Adelgado**: Does that make sense?
**Speaker 1**: Well, it's just this area.
**Speaker 1**: Or we need to add more.
**Adelgado**: No, just that area.
**Adelgado**: And then where that black line is drawn is where on your overlay, you kind of drew it out.
**Adelgado**: But all I'm saying is, like, you see, if you zoom into that on the.
**Adelgado**: On your drawing.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: On this one, if you zoom in, you see.
**Adelgado**: See that little.
**Adelgado**: Those two walls below that you see stick out fast.
**Adelgado**: Like, we just need to go past that a foot, even if that.
**Adelgado**: And that's all we're going to re.
**Adelgado**: Roof on that side.
**Adelgado**: And that's all, you know, just.
**Speaker 1**: Just to fit.
**Adelgado**: I would say two feet past.
**Adelgado**: That's plenty.
**Adelgado**: To put our parapet wall and then roof that little corner in.
**Adelgado**: Well, not up there at the top side and the bottom.
**Adelgado**: Like, if you just mirror those little walls that stick out there.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Or just to here.
**Speaker 1**: Size fits.
**Adelgado**: Well, here, let me Share my screen.
**Adelgado**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Perfect.
**Adelgado**: Thank you.
**Adelgado**: Yeah, Technology is great.
**Adelgado**: So those walls underneath come out like this.
**Speaker 1**: Exceptions.
**Adelgado**: So then your roof.
**Adelgado**: I would just come like two foot past this way.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: Two foot past this way.
**Speaker 1**: This area.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: And that's.
**Adelgado**: That's where we put the curb in.
**Adelgado**: And then we're only roofing this.
**Adelgado**: We're not doing all of this.
**Adelgado**: That's a waste of time because this is over the.
**Adelgado**: You know, it's not their space, so they don't really care.
**Adelgado**: So that's where you'll show the limit.
**Adelgado**: And plus, like, this is a whole lot of parapet wall to build, whereas this is just a little bit, you know, a little bit extra roofing.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, now, now, now I understand.
**Adelgado**: And then let me show you some pictures of here in this folder.
**Adelgado**: There's a where?
**Adelgado**: Not in there.
**Adelgado**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: There.
**Adelgado**: See here?
**Adelgado**: So if we go up here, this is Procore.
**Speaker 1**: Hey.
**Adelgado**: There.
**Adelgado**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: I love it already.
**Adelgado**: You haven't even told me.
**Adelgado**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: Yeah.
**Adelgado**: Love it.
**Adelgado**: You're a genius.
**Adelgado**: Oh, that is so awesome.
**Adelgado**: That's right.
**Adelgado**: You can.
**Adelgado**: Well, you just coin that and you'll get paid every time it's run and you'll be.
**Adelgado**: You'll be a multi millionaire just from that.
**Adelgado**: Love it.
**Adelgado**: Oh, well, that brings all things to mind.
**Adelgado**: But I just want to be.
**Adelgado**: All right to see you.
**Adelgado**: Goodbye.
**Adelgado**: All right, I'm trying to find the roof photos.
**Adelgado**: This is that project.
**Adelgado**: And there's some up on the roof to give.
**Adelgado**: So this, like, this is, you know, the bottom half of the page where you've seen those rooftop units on the plan.
**Adelgado**: You know, this is that.
**Adelgado**: This is that wall that we're going further past their space just because it's an existing wall.
**Adelgado**: And then these are some of the new rooftop curves we put in as part of that project.
**Adelgado**: But it's just like a.
**Adelgado**: You know, they put the gravel on top of a modified bed roof.
**Adelgado**: What's that?
**Adelgado**: It's a photo.
**Adelgado**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: Got some more photos here.
**Adelgado**: So this is what, like, this is another parapet wall.
**Adelgado**: So this one through here is the.
**Adelgado**: The top of their space.
**Adelgado**: So let me try and put these in perspective.
**Adelgado**: That picture is this wall right here.
**Adelgado**: And the side of this wall here, it's like this and this and that green area is like down inside of this, like inside here is that green area.
**Adelgado**: So, like these, like, they would just pull off this cap.
**Adelgado**: And when we're talking adding a parapet, it's really a curve, more or less, because that's probably maybe 10 inches higher than the roof to the top of it.
**Adelgado**: All right, let me see if we got some more photos here.
**Adelgado**: This is that back wall.
**Adelgado**: It's on the south.
**Adelgado**: And here's some of the cross things.
**Adelgado**: So that would be.
**Adelgado**: So that picture is showing you, like, this back wall, and then that curve that was running across is the one that goes right here.
**Adelgado**: So you can see it's kind of a grid.
**Adelgado**: That's another one of the short walls.
**Adelgado**: Short wall, cur curve, we'll call them.
**Adelgado**: Curb here, curb here.
**Adelgado**: Then this is that side of the metal.
**Adelgado**: Looks like a metal.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: Hey, Mark.
**Adelgado**: Good, good.
**Adelgado**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: Hold one second.
**Adelgado**: I'm sorry.
**Adelgado**: Hey, Andres, if you want to.
**Adelgado**: Are you.
**Adelgado**: So you're going to work on doing, like, a roof plan of that?
**Speaker 1**: Yes.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, I will.
**Speaker 1**: I will finish.
**Adelgado**: Okay, I'll.
**Adelgado**: Can I call you back when I get done here?
**Adelgado**: Of course.
**Adelgado**: All right, I'll call you back.
**Speaker 1**: I won't hear.
**Speaker 1**: Thank you.
