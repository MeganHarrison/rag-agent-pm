## Transcript
**Bclymer**: Early because I got another one right at 11:30.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: I know we.
**Jdawson**: I know I called you and we talked about this the other day.
**Jdawson**: And then immediately after that, we changed.
**Nbigler**: All the windows and everything.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, the windows are going in and those things are going to be visible one way or another.
**Jdawson**: So Brandon said get them.
**Jdawson**: Get them in the.
**Jdawson**: Find a way to get them in the closets.
**Jdawson**: Eli is planning to make the closets larger anyways in some capacity to fit these windows evenly.
**Jdawson**: So, yeah, I think once we get.
**Bclymer**: The wind, I mean, we talk about it when everybody gets on.
**Bclymer**: Once we get the windows shown.
**Bclymer**: Show me the windows, then I'll work out the rest.
**Jdawson**: Morning, Eli.
**Awoodhams**: Morning.
**Awoodhams**: Melissa will not be joining on my end.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: I was just on with Jeff soon.
**Jdawson**: He's jumping on here.
**Jdawson**: I don't understand why this keeps happening.
**Jdawson**: All right, we have a few open RFIs.
**Jdawson**: Knock a couple of these out real quick.
**Jdawson**: Just so everybody knows they're on the door schedule came out.
**Jdawson**: We had a handful of doors.
**Jdawson**: Actually it was the two in the vestibule entrance and then one upstairs were called out to be a six foot four door, but they are actually six foot.
**Jdawson**: So I think.
**Jdawson**: I don't think the framing or anything was called out differently.
**Jdawson**: It was just on the door schedule misidentified.
**Jdawson**: So that'll be captured the next ASI by Jeff moving the overhead doors.
**Jdawson**: Door.
**Jdawson**: All right, so this.
**Jdawson**: The city did approve this, Jeff, for us to move the doors to the north side.
**Nbigler**: Yep.
**Nbigler**: The only thing is that the door.
**Gdesmit**: That you come on here, the location.
**Nbigler**: That you called out, doesn't work because we have cross bracing there.
**Nbigler**: It'll have to be between 4 and 5.
**Ashton**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Either way, I just.
**Jdawson**: I put it here just to show one way or another.
**Jdawson**: We'll center it up, put the faux window there.
**Jdawson**: What about on the other side on the south side?
**Jdawson**: So we would eliminate one of these doors, either one.
**Jdawson**: And then these.
**Jdawson**: I see you have these centered.
**Jdawson**: These faux windows are kind of centered across these panels.
**Jdawson**: If we center the door on here, it'd be in that column, so we couldn't do that.
**Nbigler**: Can we just leave one of the two doors where they're at?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I guess it's not going to be centered anyways, is it?
**Nbigler**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Nbigler**: I think it would look more awkward if you moved it.
**Nbigler**: I think we just eliminate the one that's between six and seven.
**Nbigler**: We leave the one that's between three and four.
**Nbigler**: And then if you look at the north elevation, then I understand they wanted them further spread apart, but we can't put one between five and six, though.
**Nbigler**: It seems kind of weird to have one between three and four and one between five and six.
**Jdawson**: Can you not move the one that's.
**Ashton**: Between three and four to between two and three?
**Nbigler**: No, because there's cross bracing there, too.
**Nbigler**: The cross bracing was specifically placed to not interfere with the doors.
**Nbigler**: And so now that we're moving the doors all around.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So the two doors would have to go here and here.
**Nbigler**: They have to be right next to each other, which seems kind of counterintuitive, right?
**Jdawson**: No, no, it's the.
**Jdawson**: The.
**Jdawson**: The purpose was a, airflow, but.
**Jdawson**: And B, the.
**Jdawson**: The north side faces their court, so they want people to be coming in.
**Jdawson**: Be able to come in and out of the court and putting one door there.
**Jdawson**: And the double doors, it just.
**Jdawson**: It just opens up and everything can face.
**Jdawson**: So, yeah, either way, wherever.
**Jdawson**: Wherever they fit, they just want them.
**Jdawson**: They don't want them on the south side because it makes no sense on the south side.
**Jdawson**: Putting them anywhere on the north side makes more sense.
**Nbigler**: Okay, can we.
**Nbigler**: What if we move door 123d or even make it a single.
**Nbigler**: And essentially move the door?
**Jdawson**: Which one is that?
**Nbigler**: That's the man door that we moved that.
**Nbigler**: We used to be by the restrooms.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Nbigler**: What if we just make that a single door and move the overhead door that's on the south.
**Nbigler**: Just move it.
**Nbigler**: Literally flip it across so that it's in the same spot as it was because we don't have cross bracing there.
**Nbigler**: Then they're the same amount.
**Nbigler**: There's the same distance separated.
**Nbigler**: And then we can adjust the man door to find someplace to fit.
**Nbigler**: That makes sense.
**Jdawson**: You're talking about putting it under the.
**Jdawson**: Under the patio here.
**Nbigler**: Yeah, yeah.
**Nbigler**: So you have one that comes out undercover and one that doesn't.
**Nbigler**: Because I think packing them right next to each other would look silly.
**Awoodhams**: If.
**Nbigler**: They were in adjacent bays.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And then.
**Jdawson**: And then the door.
**Jdawson**: The double.
**Jdawson**: Make it a single door and then a single door all fitted in that same bay.
**Nbigler**: Yeah, we'll make it a single door.
**Nbigler**: Maybe we move it back to the west of seven.
**Nbigler**: Right.
**Nbigler**: We kind of tuck it in between seven and that.
**Nbigler**: The wall.
**Nbigler**: The restroom wall.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I see.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Nbigler**: We have enough room there.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Nbigler**: You want to discuss that with Mike before we go through the moving at all?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I'll check.
**Jdawson**: I'll double check with.
**Jdawson**: It's Katie that wanted this done.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I'll double check that.
**Jdawson**: Okay, Quick note.
**Jdawson**: We're going to remove all the air curtains in the Volleyball court not getting installed in there at all.
**Jdawson**: So next one is the kitchen exhaust fans through the demising wall.
**Jdawson**: All right, so we're going to be adding windows in these nooks upstairs.
**Jdawson**: And Brandon's directions to get these ducting out.
**Jdawson**: Hidden, hidden back, hidden into these closets, into these chases that we made.
**Jdawson**: So do you, Micah, do you remember what was the reason we didn't do this in the first place?
**Jdawson**: We didn't have closet space.
**Jdawson**: Or was it because we couldn't route the ducting through the joists on the fir on the ceiling of the first floor?
**Bclymer**: I think it was getting as straight a run as we could to get up, and they just couldn't.
**Bclymer**: And with some of the support columns there, as you see, you just couldn't adjust it.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, like, turning this one into the closet is.
**Jdawson**: I mean, where, where, where can we do that?
**Bclymer**: So I think you just.
**Bclymer**: I think where they.
**Bclymer**: I think the locations they're at is the.
**Bclymer**: Almost the.
**Bclymer**: I mean, I'll look at everything once we put the windows in, but those are the best.
**Bclymer**: So we can just expand some of those closets a little wider, and then we just pick up.
**Bclymer**: Because it looks like most of them are right next to a closet.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, you could just expand them and pick it up.
**Bclymer**: Except for the far north one.
**Bclymer**: Well, you could expand that closet.
**Jdawson**: I guess it was by a closet.
**Bclymer**: But yeah, so we just expand the closets a little bit, and we could even shrink the closet to a five.
**Bclymer**: And just if.
**Bclymer**: Depending on the windows, it's all going to fall.
**Bclymer**: Where, how and where the windows fall, how big they are.
**Jdawson**: So, Eli, at this point, Jeff.
**Jdawson**: Jeff gave us the.
**Jdawson**: The layout here.
**Jdawson**: You're adjusting the layout on the walls at this point.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: You had talked about furring out the walls or changing the.
**Jdawson**: Changing the size to fit everything.
**Awoodhams**: We have a couple things.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah.
**Awoodhams**: I was going to walk everybody through some of the changes on the floor plan that we're making.
**Awoodhams**: They're.
**Awoodhams**: They're really minor.
**Awoodhams**: Like, trust me.
**Awoodhams**: No, no one's going to be too pissed off.
**Jdawson**: Can we incorporate these into what you're working on with those closets by getting.
**Awoodhams**: Them inside the closets, all of these all.
**Jdawson**: So, yeah, what we're looking.
**Jdawson**: You know what we're looking at here on the second floor?
**Awoodhams**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Awoodhams**: That's the H Vac for the.
**Awoodhams**: The ducting for all the restaurants below.
**Jdawson**: Correct.
**Jdawson**: Correct.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So, yeah, punch through the mezzanine, then punches through the demising wall, comes out, you know, five feet and then turns.
**Jdawson**: Turns upward and Goes out the ceiling, so it's in the volleyball court by several feet.
**Awoodhams**: That's fine with me.
**Awoodhams**: As if they can be in the closets.
**Awoodhams**: That would be great, because we're already having a tough time with our furniture selections being able to fit inside of these the way that they want them.
**Awoodhams**: So if they're in the closets, it's all good.
**Jdawson**: You.
**Jdawson**: You.
**Jdawson**: So when you were doing furniture, you had caught these coming through and being in the way.
**Awoodhams**: No, I didn't have those coming through.
**Awoodhams**: I thought that those.
**Awoodhams**: I was told that those were in the closets.
**Awoodhams**: Like this one that you see up here.
**Awoodhams**: Kefc like that.
**Awoodhams**: That's what I thought that they were all going to be like.
**Jdawson**: I think we had them in the closets originally, or most of them.
**Jdawson**: Then we had to add these makeup air units, and then we had to shift it around, but.
**Awoodhams**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Awoodhams**: So if we can get them in the closets, that would be ideal because, you know, this is just a cool feature seating.
**Awoodhams**: But, you know, if mechanical says that we can't do it, then we'll just have to.
**Jdawson**: We just got to make these closets a little bigger.
**Awoodhams**: Oh, those can't move at all.
**Awoodhams**: It's the closets that have to move.
**Awoodhams**: They can't.
**Jdawson**: They can move some of them.
**Jdawson**: But, like.
**Jdawson**: So this.
**Jdawson**: This one here.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: This is.
**Jdawson**: This is the northernmost nook.
**Jdawson**: There's a column right here.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So I can't just elbow over here and run it up in the closet.
**Jdawson**: So, of course, I would have to make the closet bigger here.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Let's see.
**Jdawson**: Here's one closet bigger.
**Jdawson**: This one I can.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Awoodhams**: Here's what I'll say, guys.
**Awoodhams**: If.
**Awoodhams**: If you're gonna need to make these bigger, if it's easier to make the Cl.
**Awoodhams**: To adjust the closet sizes, I'll work with it.
**Awoodhams**: Okay.
**Awoodhams**: I can change my furniture layout to maybe, you know, go 90 degrees, and we'll figure something out there.
**Awoodhams**: I'll.
**Awoodhams**: I'll be flexible in my layout.
**Awoodhams**: I'm not going to be like, you have to do it this way.
**Awoodhams**: So.
**Awoodhams**: So just do what you need to do and I' fit.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, Let me look at it a little bit, Eli, and then I'll verify.
**Jdawson**: I.
**Bclymer**: Just checking, like you were talking about that one at the far north.
**Bclymer**: That far north one might be able to, on the first floor, go out the back of the hood instead of the front, and then it will turn up on the other side of the column.
**Bclymer**: So we might be able to keep that closet as is some of the other ones.
**Bclymer**: I don't know if there's any play, but let me.
**Bclymer**: Let me take a look at it again.
**Bclymer**: Just.
**Awoodhams**: Just.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah.
**Awoodhams**: See what you can do.
**Awoodhams**: And at some point here, I'd love to walk you guys through some of the floor plans so you can see, like, the design intent, and that may help you understand kind of what I'm going for.
**Awoodhams**: But again, I mean, form follows function, so make it.
**Awoodhams**: Make it what you need it to be.
**Awoodhams**: And we will.
**Awoodhams**: We'll adjust our floor plan accordingly, and if there's some level of symmetry that you can maintain, that would be fantastic.
**Awoodhams**: But no expectations.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: I think the biggest thing will be figuring out.
**Bclymer**: So which way do we want to do this?
**Bclymer**: I guess figure out how to make these closets and ductwork work first and then sort out where the windows are going to go.
**Awoodhams**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Awoodhams**: That makes the most sense because we'll center those in within the framework.
**Awoodhams**: And again, that's why, like, let's get some level of consistency in the spacing so that it doesn't just look, like, ridiculous from the.
**Awoodhams**: The beach volleyball side.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Awoodhams**: But, yeah, you'll see what I did, and you'll be like, all right, that's what you're going.
**Bclymer**: I just saw another one where we can maybe shift the whole closet south and plan tighter to where the makeup air comes at.
**Bclymer**: And then it would incorporate the exhaust that's coming outside of the closet.
**Bclymer**: So I'll look at things like that, and then we'll.
**Awoodhams**: Cool.
**Bclymer**: We'll go from there.
**Awoodhams**: Great.
**Jdawson**: Perfect.
**Jdawson**: Perfect.
**Jdawson**: This one's more for Jeff.
**Jdawson**: Do you have any issues if we were to remove this awning?
**Jdawson**: No reason for it.
**Jdawson**: We're not gonna.
**Jdawson**: We're gonna get rid of this door.
**Jdawson**: There's trees in front of it.
**Jdawson**: There's a grease trap right outside.
**Jdawson**: This door is basically gonna be emergency use.
**Nbigler**: Yep.
**Nbigler**: I have that on my list for the neck for the first change.
**Nbigler**: Bolton.
**Nbigler**: For what for the first change bolt.
**Nbigler**: And I have that on my list to.
**Jdawson**: Oh, oh, change.
**Awoodhams**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: I haven't confirmed.
**Jdawson**: I just.
**Awoodhams**: I just.
**Jdawson**: I needed to check with you.
**Jdawson**: Versus.
**Jdawson**: I don't know if that was.
**Jdawson**: If this was like, a pud thing.
**Jdawson**: We have to have a certain amount of awnings coverage or something like that.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: All right, I'm.
**Jdawson**: We're recommend going ahead and pulling this.
**Jdawson**: I'll.
**Jdawson**: I'll confirm with you, though.
**Jdawson**: Next one is the flashing at the es.
**Nbigler**: Yeah, I saw that note for the rfi.
**Nbigler**: I'll have to go back and look at it specifically.
**Nbigler**: A lot of times, the Supplier like we're showing just essentially that we want it flashing the wall.
**Nbigler**: And usually if it's a.
**Nbigler**: The supplier will have their own kind of additional piece that comes out on top of it.
**Nbigler**: So it depends on who is.
**Nbigler**: Who the supplier is.
**Nbigler**: Do you have one that's already did it?
**Nbigler**: We could probably brief approval just to talk to him directly and figure out what they're providing and what we need to provide by the wall.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Nbigler**: Because he's gonna come up there and the wall's already going to be flashed by the time he gets there.
**Nbigler**: Right.
**Nbigler**: And so I just want to make sure, you know, that we have everything covered.
**Jdawson**: So that's what I was thinking.
**Nbigler**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: When the EFIs puts their flashing in, this is the sill flashing that he's gonna put in.
**Jdawson**: So I mean, just a head wall flashing would be, you know, I would expect the headwall flashes to run on top of this awning.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And walk in cooler.
**Jdawson**: Eli gave us these options here.
**Jdawson**: So currently the cooler is basically wall to wall to wall within that room.
**Jdawson**: There's about a foot or so on this wall when you enter where there's a couple columns.
**Jdawson**: Got a.
**Jdawson**: This is a left hand reverse open.
**Ashton**: Yeah, it's.
**Ashton**: It's hinged on the left.
**Ashton**: But I mean it can.
**Ashton**: We can hinge it on either side.
**Ashton**: That's not a.
**Ashton**: That, that's.
**Ashton**: That's whichever way works.
**Ashton**: It's just.
**Jdawson**: The other drawing.
**Ashton**: Go ahead.
**Ashton**: Sorry.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, no, you're good.
**Jdawson**: So the current one has doors opening here.
**Jdawson**: So into us.
**Jdawson**: We'll either at least eliminate door 109 or.
**Jdawson**: Jeff, we could do this.
**Jdawson**: Get rid of these walls and leave this storage and cooler space open.
**Jdawson**: Get rid of all these.
**Nbigler**: I think we should probably just eliminate the door that we originally talked about that faces to the east and eliminate that portion wall.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Nbigler**: Like that.
**Nbigler**: Yep, got it.
**Nbigler**: All right, so we'll just eliminate that.
**Nbigler**: Yeah, we'll just eliminate that entire portion of wall.
**Jdawson**: Perfect.
**Nbigler**: Okay.
**Ashton**: Just to click for the.
**Ashton**: That you're just going to eliminate the wall.
**Ashton**: So we're going to keep the door where it is and eliminate that wall.
**Nbigler**: Yep.
**Nbigler**: Correct.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Ashton**: So what we'll do then is we'll probably hinge it on the.
**Ashton**: It will make.
**Ashton**: We'll hinge the door on the right then which.
**Ashton**: Because that will allow it to open further and also that'll make the most access.
**Ashton**: That'll make the most sense for access to the walk in cooler coming from, you know, the kitchen or space.
**Ashton**: So we'll leave it as is we'll reverse the hinging on the door to the right side, and then that way they'll have the easiest access operationally to get in and out of that cooler.
**Jdawson**: All right, that was it for the RFIs.
**Jdawson**: I did have a question.
**Jdawson**: Who is providing the bar framing and finish plans?
**Jdawson**: Jeff, I think we talked about this a while ago.
**Jdawson**: I thought you were gonna have it in your cut sheets when the walls came out.
**Jdawson**: But.
**Nbigler**: For.
**Jdawson**: What Was it for the bars?
**Nbigler**: For the actual framing for it?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Framing new walls.
**Jdawson**: I asked earlier, are we doing, like, a die wall system or just framing new walls?
**Nbigler**: No, yeah, we were.
**Nbigler**: It's.
**Nbigler**: It's a.
**Nbigler**: It's a very similar detail, Eli, to what you guys had before.
**Nbigler**: If you guys just want to include that same exact cut that you did from Liberty, I mean, it's essentially exactly the same.
**Awoodhams**: Our framing plan?
**Nbigler**: No, just the.
**Nbigler**: Essentially the millwork section for the bars itself.
**Awoodhams**: Okay.
**Nbigler**: Ours is essentially identical to what you guys had.
**Awoodhams**: Okay, cool.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: So they'll get captured.
**Jdawson**: And Eli's.
**Jdawson**: Eli said you don't.
**Jdawson**: You didn't.
**Jdawson**: You didn't.
**Nbigler**: I mean, we can put it in ours.
**Nbigler**: It's the.
**Nbigler**: It's the same, but it'll be easier, I think, for Eli to do it, because then he can call out.
**Nbigler**: Yeah, the material and everything that he wants on the face, and that's fine.
**Jdawson**: Speaking of that bar top color on our plans here, I think, Jeff, you'd call out for quartz, if I remember right.
**Awoodhams**: Quartz.
**Nbigler**: That's.
**Jdawson**: That's fine.
**Jdawson**: I just need to know what.
**Jdawson**: What you're planning to use and what color.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah, we're probably going to need a natural stone because it's inside, outside.
**Awoodhams**: So we'll pick some kind of black granite.
**Awoodhams**: So we'll.
**Jdawson**: We'll.
**Awoodhams**: We can probably use the same thing that we used up in or down over in Liberty.
**Awoodhams**: It was pretty affordable.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So one and a half.
**Jdawson**: Still one and a half inch thick.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah, it's a 3.3centimeter product.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Are you planning.
**Jdawson**: Is there any.
**Jdawson**: Any routing that needs to be done, or is there any RGB lights that you put in that were routed out or anything like that?
**Awoodhams**: I don't think we're gonna need to route out any lighting.
**Awoodhams**: We can just stick it under there.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah, I wouldn't say we need the extra cost of routing.
**Awoodhams**: It'd be slick, but no.
**Jdawson**: All right, good enough.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: That is all I had for the design updates.
**Jdawson**: Nick, I need to get with you on change order pricing.
**Jdawson**: Do any of these issues or do any of these Affect you, Nick, for your panels or anything like that.
**Gdesmit**: Overhead door movement and those doors?
**Gdesmit**: I would say yeah, you know, we just need to hear or make the decisions, and then we can kind of work through it, get creative and start engaging the guys who are going to be on site to see what we can do.
**Gdesmit**: Because, you know, if we have an overhead door, but it's either being eliminated or moved, I don't know if we have enough wall panels and framing material and girts, they're going to work on site.
**Gdesmit**: You know what I mean?
**Jdawson**: Well, if we just took this door and reversed it, it's at the same size of Bay, obviously, 25ft.
**Jdawson**: So didn't they just take the girts from here, put them over here?
**Jdawson**: They haven't made it.
**Gdesmit**: I mean, that.
**Gdesmit**: That'd be fine, but I didn't know if.
**Gdesmit**: Is it final that it's moving straight across?
**Jdawson**: We are going to move it across this.
**Jdawson**: This will probably be.
**Jdawson**: I mean, that's what we're gonna recommend.
**Jdawson**: And Katie.
**Jdawson**: Katie just wanted to.
**Jdawson**: On the north, so I tried to center him on this one, but with the bracing there, we're not gonna be able to.
**Jdawson**: So what Jeff proposed makes the most sense and looks the best.
**Jdawson**: And PUD is not going to give us any kickback by doing what Jeff suggested.
**Nbigler**: So really, I was trying to help Nick out.
**Nbigler**: So, yes.
**Jdawson**: Mostly make his first week back easy.
**Jdawson**: So, yeah, we'll go.
**Jdawson**: We'll go ahead and move forward with that.
**Jdawson**: We'll do the single door here, have that garage door.
**Nbigler**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And then you won't do anything with these panels.
**Jdawson**: The panel will stay in its location here, right?
**Awoodhams**: Yeah.
**Gdesmit**: If you guys could just send me an updated set of drawings at heavy suite just so I can start, like, making notes to our guys that are going to be in the field, like, hey, this is happening.
**Gdesmit**: This is happening.
**Gdesmit**: Just be aware of this, because these are not on our four construction drawings, right?
**Nbigler**: Yep.
**Gdesmit**: So if I could see that, and then if I could see the.
**Gdesmit**: If I could see Jerrica's latest drawings about the perimeter angle and those final details when it comes out.
**Gdesmit**: So I should have my mezzanine stuff very soon.
**Gdesmit**: To answer your question that you emailed me about, Glenn, in fact, I'm wondering if I'm going to be able to get that here even today or tomorrow.
**Gdesmit**: So as soon as I get our four construction shop drawings, I will blast them out to everybody.
**Gdesmit**: And the mezzanine.
**Gdesmit**: The final mezzanine layout will be within those draw.
**Nbigler**: So, yeah, Nick, Glenn, we're working through on our side to get all those items.
**Nbigler**: I'm hoping to be able to have everything that we've discussed so far as long as you can have Katie confirm where those are going by early next week and then we'll get the windows in.
**Nbigler**: Well, that'll probably be CD2 because I.
**Nbigler**: I think that's going to take a longer.
**Nbigler**: I think that'll take longer on Micah's side to kind of work.
**Nbigler**: Work through all that then kind of Monday or Tuesday.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Gdesmit**: Well, that is the windows.
**Gdesmit**: Well, it'll affect the exhaust fan locations and the mezzanine framed openings.
**Gdesmit**: Yeah, I planned on field located for that stuff anyways.
**Gdesmit**: So guess what?
**Gdesmit**: I actually made a good decision that might pay off.
**Ashton**: So.
**Nbigler**: For those windows, I would recommend that we keep the wall and the door and everything called out and being rated as it is and just use a hollow metal frame with a.
**Nbigler**: Most of Those have like a 3:16 kind of firelight glass that you can use for it.
**Nbigler**: I feel like that would be the easiest thing to put back as opposed to doing an aluminum storefront window.
**Nbigler**: But obviously.
**Gdesmit**: So we don't have any wall framing at that common wall right at line.
**Nbigler**: You don't know.
**Nbigler**: Yeah, correct.
**Gdesmit**: I don't.
**Gdesmit**: So that's why I'm like, you know.
**Nbigler**: Yeah.
**Nbigler**: This is more of a Glen.
**Nbigler**: Yeah.
**Nbigler**: Question as far as what we're putting back in there, as far as what the windows want to be.
**Gdesmit**: Gotcha.
**Jdawson**: So derating that wall is just not.
**Jdawson**: Just doesn't make sense to do it that way.
**Nbigler**: Yeah.
**Nbigler**: I think it would be a mistake the way that we have the life safety stuff work through right now.
**Nbigler**: It would also require filing an official with the state.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Nbigler**: I don't think the hollow light, the hollow metal, you know, just a four sided hollow metal frame already inherently can be rated up to 45 minutes, which is what we would need with the firelight glass.
**Nbigler**: And it's going to be way less expensive than out then storefront.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: Eli, you want to go ahead and take it away?
**Awoodhams**: Yes, sir.
**Jdawson**: Micah, I know you gotta jump off, man.
**Jdawson**: I appreciate you.
**Awoodhams**: All right, can everyone.
**Bclymer**: I'll work on that quickly and get.
**Jdawson**: It back to you.
**Jdawson**: Have a good talk to you soon.
**Jdawson**: Thanks.
**Awoodhams**: Can everyone see my screen?
**Jdawson**: Sir.
**Awoodhams**: All right, awesome.
**Awoodhams**: So this is the general floor plan that we're working with at present.
**Awoodhams**: There are some things that could change.
**Awoodhams**: I got a, like a yellow light from Mike yesterday in an email, but he's liking the general direction of where this is heading.
**Awoodhams**: I'm kind of just Going to go space by space and show you guys and if there are any questions, just jump right in for the bar.
**Awoodhams**: You know, simple seating.
**Awoodhams**: We, and I think you guys may have seen some of this on Tuesday's OAC with, with Mel showing you some stuff.
**Awoodhams**: But we did some simple seating, bar seating.
**Awoodhams**: We've adjusted this to be just walls with openings.
**Awoodhams**: The one thing that we did do was we moved all of this down about, I think, well, you could see it was aligned with the column.
**Awoodhams**: We moved it down a little bit to shrink this to a three foot opening.
**Awoodhams**: We were really tight on space over here.
**Awoodhams**: So ownership was like, yeah, go ahead and just move that down if it doesn't affect anything.
**Awoodhams**: So if this is actually affecting somebody, something, somebody please let me know on this end.
**Awoodhams**: But I don't know if there's mep.
**Awoodhams**: We haven't checked it yet.
**Awoodhams**: We just kind of made a quick adjustment.
**Awoodhams**: So please let us know around the bar.
**Awoodhams**: We're going to frame this all in.
**Awoodhams**: We're going to do some kind of closet.
**Awoodhams**: I don't know what side you're going to enter from or if it's going to be both entrances.
**Awoodhams**: But it helps frame our Coke machine because we need 36 inches unless we change the unit.
**Awoodhams**: We wanted trash on both sides and some millwork so that you can capture that for storage and whatever you need.
**Awoodhams**: Basically this is going to service a lot of people coming in from the volleyball side as well as grabbing things quickly from food to come, grab something, throw something out, yada, yada, yada.
**Awoodhams**: Moving up bar hasn't changed.
**Awoodhams**: This is our biggest constraint.
**Awoodhams**: We didn't have enough space here in the original floor plan, so we had made some adjustments.
**Awoodhams**: We wanted the space to be centered so that when you're coming down you can get quickly to the beer wall and vice versa.
**Awoodhams**: We wanted to have a bit of a contained environment.
**Awoodhams**: So we did all bankhead seating with good corridor.
**Awoodhams**: And then on the other side we got some four tops lined up as well.
**Awoodhams**: The beer wall.
**Awoodhams**: We still have to talk about this.
**Awoodhams**: I see that we have a chase back here for the beer lines, but we needed a lot more space than we thought when we planned through all of this.
**Awoodhams**: And there needed to be access panels and ways to get through it.
**Awoodhams**: So I basically just took the 36 inches that we had and we're going to talk through this with Pour My Beer, assuming they're doing it again and they'll advise us on whether this layout still works for our design intent.
**Awoodhams**: But we have more than enough Room.
**Awoodhams**: We accounted for all that.
**Awoodhams**: So let's just be prepared for some flexibility in here.
**Gdesmit**: You know that there's columns there.
**Jdawson**: Like.
**Gdesmit**: In here to your left.
**Awoodhams**: I see this one.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Either way, still, even if he's just talking about.
**Jdawson**: Okay, all right.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: You're just, you'll just talk.
**Jdawson**: You're just talking about making that wall wider.
**Gdesmit**: So I don't know where it is.
**Awoodhams**: But yeah, we're gonna have a, an ice machine in here.
**Awoodhams**: We're gonna have millwork set into here.
**Awoodhams**: And the beer lines need to be serviceable from behind and in front.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: There's a column.
**Jdawson**: Like when you walk into the bathrooms, they're on the left hand side when you walk in.
**Jdawson**: Right, right.
**Jdawson**: When you pass the corner of the wall, there will be another column right in that wall, is what he's saying here.
**Jdawson**: Well, even.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, it'll be even online with the, with the mezzanine columns.
**Jdawson**: So just, just so.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah, right, Right there.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Ashton**: Hey, Eli, real quick, ice maker, you're thinking the same thing we've got going in Liberty, that built in.
**Awoodhams**: We want to replicate almost the exact same thing.
**Awoodhams**: The only thing that's going to change here if our, our beer wall in Liberty is 25ft long.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah.
**Awoodhams**: We're shrinking that.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Awoodhams**: Because we're going to have this weird area right here and we need signage on the side and we need people to be able to like step aside as well.
**Awoodhams**: So we're actually making this a little bit smaller.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah, three feet, two and a half feet smaller.
**Ashton**: I'm just going to make a note to add that ice maker, that's all.
**Ashton**: I just wanted to clarify.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah, you bet.
**Awoodhams**: Thank you.
**Jdawson**: Thanks.
**Nbigler**: Sure.
**Awoodhams**: So this was one big change more on.
**Awoodhams**: I don't know whose end, but they got rid of the game room.
**Awoodhams**: And we saw like, when we were initially looking at the layout, it was like these four tables on either side of the bar.
**Awoodhams**: And all this was all we had on the main level for seating along with, you know, this over here.
**Awoodhams**: So we converted this to seating space.
**Awoodhams**: So this is going to be a big dining room over here.
**Awoodhams**: And this is our command current layout schematic, unless anything changes.
**Awoodhams**: So you got banquette seating, high tops, you know, communal.
**Awoodhams**: Communal seating, and then some two tops along the wall for patio.
**Awoodhams**: Pretty simple.
**Awoodhams**: You know, we want the focus to be on being able to see the game.
**Awoodhams**: So we did some picnic tables oriented so everybody can look over.
**Awoodhams**: All we had room here in the corridor was for two tops.
**Awoodhams**: We thought about doing some more like loungey Seating like two accent tables across from each other, so subject to change.
**Awoodhams**: And they want this to be sort of the adult chill zone.
**Awoodhams**: So we set this up to have a lot more, you know, comfortable seating where the adults can kind of escape the chaos and the noise.
**Awoodhams**: Picnic tables in between helped us with our spacing some planters.
**Awoodhams**: This is sort of the more quieter side of the establishment.
**Awoodhams**: All right, anybody have any questions about where we're heading with the floor plan on Level 1 or.
**Awoodhams**: Or any concerns about this furniture in general?
**Jdawson**: Eli, is it.
**Jdawson**: Is this outdoor year round furniture?
**Jdawson**: Are we.
**Jdawson**: Are they gonna do it like could.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, there's no storage needed.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah, correct.
**Jdawson**: Chad was.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah, they'll just, they'll cover these up in the off seasons or they'll have some way to store it.
**Awoodhams**: I don't know where, but yeah, this is meant to be four season furniture.
**Nbigler**: The only concern that I would have based on that, we'd have to go back and look.
**Nbigler**: I think once you guys get a furniture layout and everything that you guys are.
**Nbigler**: That you are comfortable with, we will need to go through and do actual seat counts for it.
**Nbigler**: Because in Indiana they allow you to base fixtures based on like actual and not necessarily like co document load.
**Nbigler**: And so we've been very.
**Nbigler**: We were very careful in the initial one to kind of keep that as low as we can just because we.
**Nbigler**: Of how many fixtures we have in the restrooms.
**Nbigler**: So if it expands by 30%, then all of a sudden we may be.
**Nbigler**: We have, we have a little bit of flexibility.
**Nbigler**: We have kind of like one extra for each one.
**Nbigler**: We've obviously added the ones in the volleyball area, which helps.
**Nbigler**: Right.
**Nbigler**: But I just want to make sure that we don't all of a sudden add, you know, 200 or 300 occupants.
**Nbigler**: And all of a sudden now we need four extra, you know, water closets that work.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah, that's a great call.
**Awoodhams**: Once we get our seat, our seating plan near finalized, I'll go ahead and send out a account to everyone and you guys can let me know what you're seeing on your occupancy and who was just talking because I can't see anybody.
**Nbigler**: Oh, Jeff.
**Awoodhams**: All right, thanks, Jeff.
**Awoodhams**: You got it.
**Awoodhams**: All right, cool.
**Awoodhams**: Top level.
**Awoodhams**: So this is where.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah, I mean, we added a lot of seating up here.
**Awoodhams**: There's.
**Awoodhams**: There's a lot.
**Awoodhams**: This is the majority of the restaurant, to be honest.
**Awoodhams**: So I'll just start at the top of the steps.
**Awoodhams**: Top of the steps.
**Awoodhams**: You know, we have rail seating so you can look out over the whole Restaurant.
**Awoodhams**: We called this the living room.
**Awoodhams**: Back in Liberty, we basically just mirrored both sides.
**Awoodhams**: We got banquette seating, we got seating here.
**Awoodhams**: We're going to have, we are going to do the, the fire, the electric fireplace and create a vibe over here with a big 83 inch TV.
**Awoodhams**: And then over on this end we're going to have some six tops.
**Awoodhams**: So yeah, these may have to change based on occupancy.
**Awoodhams**: So you know, the.
**Awoodhams**: With the closets, you can see what we did.
**Awoodhams**: We had to be.
**Awoodhams**: We didn't have enough space with our original furniture selections to fit in here.
**Awoodhams**: So we're going to have to find sofas that are a little, slightly less depth.
**Awoodhams**: And we're gonna have to do much smaller, you know, coffee tables.
**Awoodhams**: If these are getting bigger, we can turn these into like really cool U shaped booths and things like that.
**Awoodhams**: So like I was saying, you guys just let me know what, what these closets need to turn into and we'll plan accordingly.
**Awoodhams**: And we put the windows in as well.
**Awoodhams**: And over here, you know, we were looking to keep these all symmetrical.
**Awoodhams**: So that was the only reason that we were looking to build out a detail in here.
**Awoodhams**: So whatever you guys choose to do, I'll work with.
**Awoodhams**: Additionally, we are going to do arched openings in here that mimic sort of the windows that we have on the facade of the entrance.
**Awoodhams**: So that type of arch.
**Awoodhams**: We're going to do arches for all of these.
**Awoodhams**: So there will be a little bit more framing that needs to go into this.
**Awoodhams**: Now over here, we basically just mirrored these.
**Awoodhams**: So you got some boot seating, open seating, trash receptacles we placed strategically around.
**Awoodhams**: We basically just took this and flipped it over so, you know, everybody can get their soft drinks and whatnot up here.
**Awoodhams**: And then you have trash for this lower section, soft drinks over here with trash, and then trash for this upper section here.
**Awoodhams**: Over here.
**Awoodhams**: Pretty simple layout.
**Awoodhams**: There wasn't much we could do given the doors and the openings.
**Awoodhams**: And then for the patios, a variety of picnic tables, high tops, couch seating mirrored over and then along the wall.
**Awoodhams**: They wanted to maximize seating so that we can again look out at the action.
**Awoodhams**: So that's why everything's oriented, so both parties could see what's happening at the games on the other side.
**Awoodhams**: And we basically just filled all of this out.
**Awoodhams**: And then the last thing you know, we put up a little wall here.
**Awoodhams**: We got to figure out what's happening with that wall.
**Awoodhams**: And then we have our seating again.
**Awoodhams**: We want everything to be oriented so that everyone can see the screen and oh, Now I can get rid of this and provide enough access, you know, for everybody to get through a number of ways so that there's good clearance on every side.
**Awoodhams**: So that's kind of where we landed on floor plans.
**Awoodhams**: Again, we're still waiting for the official green light, but they told me to move forward and present these to you guys and see if anybody had any concerns with what we're doing.
**Awoodhams**: And so please feel free to, you know, let me know what you're seeing.
**Jdawson**: Did you already do the ice cream bar where you had taken away the.
**Jdawson**: The countertop and.
**Awoodhams**: Yep, yep, right there.
**Awoodhams**: And I was.
**Awoodhams**: This is what I was saying.
**Awoodhams**: We.
**Awoodhams**: We also moved this down about a foot.
**Awoodhams**: There is a bunch of blank space over here.
**Awoodhams**: Let me see if I can.
**Awoodhams**: Let me go all the way up.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah, so this is where it was originally, and we saw this.
**Awoodhams**: There was a bunch of open space here, so we figured we had some room to push this down a little, to give a little bit more space up here, because this is the original layout that we wanted.
**Awoodhams**: But we were worried that coming in, you're just hit with a wall of people.
**Awoodhams**: So we wanted to make it so that you can walk straight through and have better.
**Awoodhams**: Better movement.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so in black, the black granite countertop will go on all of these bars.
**Jdawson**: The ice cream bar.
**Jdawson**: No, that'll.
**Jdawson**: Will that have its own FF and it will have its own kitchen equipment, countertops, stuff that comes in, or is that getting countertops still?
**Awoodhams**: It's gonna get it.
**Awoodhams**: Well, I didn't put it in yet, but they're gonna have something like this on.
**Awoodhams**: On.
**Awoodhams**: It's basically the same as all the other ones.
**Awoodhams**: You know, we'll have a little ADA ledge and a countertop that spills over onto either side for service.
**Jdawson**: The black.
**Jdawson**: The black granite.
**Awoodhams**: The black granite, Correct.
**Gdesmit**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: Bathrooms will be the same.
**Awoodhams**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: Everything.
**Jdawson**: Okay, can I.
**Ashton**: Can you.
**Ashton**: The beer wall.
**Ashton**: Can you go back to that?
**Ashton**: So again, my question is more.
**Ashton**: For now, in Liberty, we added a second walk in cooler to accommodate all.
**Ashton**: All the.
**Ashton**: The beer for the beer wall.
**Ashton**: If we're not that.
**Ashton**: I don't know that that walk in cooler as it's currently constructed is going to be big enough to feed both bars and the beer wall.
**Ashton**: Okay, so just something, I mean, to talk to Mike and, you know, I'll definitely, you know what I mean?
**Ashton**: Because I'll.
**Ashton**: I'll be out.
**Ashton**: I'll actually be out at Liberty on Monday.
**Ashton**: So I can, you know, if given the opportunity, maybe.
**Ashton**: But just something to think about.
**Ashton**: If we can.
**Ashton**: If we're planning on running the same amount of beers to both bars like we are in Liberty.
**Ashton**: And this beer wall.
**Ashton**: I know you said it'll be a little bit smaller, but I mean, it's like I said, it's got.
**Ashton**: We added a dedicated walk in for it in Liberty.
**Awoodhams**: So Mike actually wants more taps in a smaller setup.
**Ashton**: More taps in a small.
**Awoodhams**: He wants 30.
**Ashton**: Okay.
**Awoodhams**: So that he wants things here that you can't get at the other ones.
**Ashton**: Yeah.
**Awoodhams**: Or it's that, you know, again, we.
**Awoodhams**: We're doing like a draft cocktail.
**Awoodhams**: We're going to have soda water on tap.
**Awoodhams**: We're going to have water on tap.
**Awoodhams**: Those would probably be the first two things that I would say like soda water and clean water or drinkable water to go, because you have the coke stations over here that you can get that.
**Awoodhams**: So it seems a little redundant to me, but if they want to just focus on just beer out of this wall, no problem.
**Awoodhams**: It's the.
**Awoodhams**: Maybe it's.
**Awoodhams**: Now that I'm talking through it, it's probably the cocktails.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Awoodhams**: That.
**Awoodhams**: That are adding to.
**Awoodhams**: To the tap system.
**Ashton**: Okay.
**Ashton**: And then I guess, Glenn, something to think about.
**Ashton**: If we can't.
**Ashton**: If we need to expand the walk in to accommodate for this.
**Ashton**: And you know, we had talked about.
**Ashton**: When we talked about the walk in options, we talked about just eliminating that door and leaving it where it is.
**Ashton**: If we decided to do the other way where you came in front and we could extend that walk in out into the storage.
**Ashton**: I mean, we'd have to talk about the details of what's in the storage and how much space they need.
**Ashton**: But I can.
**Ashton**: We're going to need a bigger.
**Ashton**: We're going to need more walk in space for the beer for.
**Ashton**: For the addition of the beer wall than what we.
**Jdawson**: How much space do we have right there, Eli, for that door, that south door to shift all the way to.
**Jdawson**: What's that.
**Jdawson**: What's that block out there next to storage 110?
**Awoodhams**: Oh, storage 110.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: What's that.
**Jdawson**: What's that block right there for?
**Jdawson**: What's that empty space?
**Awoodhams**: Oh, this?
**Awoodhams**: I have no idea what this is.
**Ashton**: Yeah, I couldn't tell.
**Ashton**: It looks like it's some type of chase or something, but I couldn't tell.
**Jdawson**: Jeff, do you know what that is?
**Jdawson**: Jeff sent you a message.
**Jdawson**: He had to hop off.
**Awoodhams**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: He said to email him with any questions.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, it looks.
**Jdawson**: It's a chase on the first floor plan and second floor plan.
**Jdawson**: I don't know what's going into it, though.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah, it's here, too.
**Jdawson**: It's going all the way up.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, but there's nothing in it because.
**Awoodhams**: What.
**Awoodhams**: What is this equipment?
**Awoodhams**: What is all this here?
**Ashton**: Those.
**Ashton**: The first few.
**Ashton**: Those are.
**Ashton**: Those are ice makers.
**Ashton**: And that's reaching.
**Ashton**: Just reaching refrigerator coolers on the other side.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah.
**Awoodhams**: So this wouldn't be benting anything from here.
**Ashton**: No, that Chase was.
**Ashton**: That Chase was in the original before we dropped any equipment in that Chase was there.
**Ashton**: So.
**Ashton**: I don't know.
**Jdawson**: It looks like there's ducting.
**Jdawson**: It's an H vac, Chase.
**Ashton**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: It's on the mechanical plants, so.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: But either way, we could scoot that door, whatever door number that is on the south.
**Jdawson**: On the south wall, we'll eliminate the north door.
**Jdawson**: We can scoot that one to the south as far as we can and get that much room out of the cooler, right?
**Nbigler**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jdawson**: At a minimum.
**Jdawson**: I don't know.
**Jdawson**: I don't know what that distance is, but.
**Ashton**: And I mean, we can configure the cooler any sizes and shape.
**Ashton**: We.
**Ashton**: You know what I mean?
**Ashton**: We, you know, we can configure it any way we need to to make room.
**Ashton**: We're just need.
**Ashton**: You know, we're going to need additional space for that beer wall.
**Jdawson**: Well, without redesigning the building, we'd have to.
**Jdawson**: Can really only continue to go south.
**Ashton**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Ashton**: Right.
**Ashton**: Yeah.
**Ashton**: So.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so it looks like from that wall to the.
**Jdawson**: Where that.
**Jdawson**: Where that door is that we're talking about, it's 6 foot 10.
**Jdawson**: That's a 3, 0 doors.
**Jdawson**: We could.
**Jdawson**: We could add 3ft, essentially to the cooler.
**Jdawson**: I don't know if that's a signal.
**Jdawson**: I don't know if that's enough, but.
**Ashton**: We'Ll have to talk over the details of what exactly they're picturing pouring at each location and how we can.
**Ashton**: Because the other thing we can all.
**Ashton**: You know, you could always put, you know, we're planning for half barrel kegs.
**Ashton**: You could always plan for six barrels, but your margins are a lot smaller, which they're not.
**Ashton**: You know, obviously you make your money on your margins on alcohol, so we, We'll.
**Ashton**: We'll talk through it, but it's just something to think about for next time, you know, when you talk with Mike and the rest of them and.
**Ashton**: And see what they're thinking on that.
**Ashton**: So.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Awoodhams**: All right.
**Jdawson**: Sorry.
**Jdawson**: Go ahead, Elan.
**Ashton**: All right.
**Jdawson**: Thank you.
**Jdawson**: Oh, were you done?
**Awoodhams**: Oh, that was it.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Awoodhams**: Those are my two layouts.
**Jdawson**: Awesome.
**Jdawson**: All right, Nick, you were Gone for a couple weeks, man.
**Jdawson**: Anything that you have for us?
**Gdesmit**: No, I'm just in a better mood now after being away from you guys for two weeks.
**Jdawson**: Chad.
**Jdawson**: Chad hasn't gotten on you about the.
**Jdawson**: About the steel not being there?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, Nick, when's my still gonna show up?
**Gdesmit**: I'm hoping to get firm days and actual times for each truck here pretty soon, so.
**Gdesmit**: I think we told you 623.
**Jdawson**: No, you said all the steel would.
**Ashton**: Be here by 623.
**Jdawson**: You originally had steel showing up 69 and 6 16.
**Gdesmit**: Yeah, those were the ship dates.
**Gdesmit**: So with some of the stuff, you know, depending on the components in the buyout items, for some of the hot rolled steel, I'm chasing it down and I'll send it to you as soon as I receive it.
**Gdesmit**: I'm talking to or I've been in the background of this meeting emailing VP their shipping department.
**Gdesmit**: So as soon as I know, I'll.
**Jdawson**: Get it to you.
**Jdawson**: I can say is if we're not going vertical on the 23rd, Mr.
**Jdawson**: Brandon's gonna be all over you.
**Nbigler**: And I'm not scared of Brandon.
**Jdawson**: No.
**Gdesmit**: How's it going on site with Merit right now?
**Jdawson**: They're here.
**Nbigler**: They're moving.
**Jdawson**: Finally got some dry weather.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Next week, all rain.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, it's supposed to be like eight days, 30.
**Gdesmit**: Yeah, I mean, if we start on the 23rd, it would be a miracle looking at the forecast.
**Jdawson**: Bring my kayak to work.
**Jdawson**: Eli, when's the last time it rained out there?
**Awoodhams**: We just got our rainiest June, I think, in years.
**Awoodhams**: We had more rain than Seattle for like the first time in history.
**Awoodhams**: For the month of June, it rained.
**Awoodhams**: It rained for like three weeks straight, but this state has never looked so green.
**Awoodhams**: It's beautiful out here.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah.
**Awoodhams**: But 360 days of sunshine took a hit.
**Awoodhams**: I gotta hop off, fellas.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Awoodhams**: I gotta give you another oech.
**Awoodhams**: All right.
**Awoodhams**: But thank you everyone for your time.
**Jdawson**: All right, guys.
**Awoodhams**: Thanks.
**Jdawson**: Later.
**Jdawson**: Have a good one, Glenn.
**Ashton**: Also, the shop drawing on that walk in as it's currently constructed.
**Ashton**: As soon as I get it, and then we'll talk.
**Jdawson**: Oh, I.
**Jdawson**: I mean, that's.
**Jdawson**: That's fine.
**Jdawson**: I.
**Jdawson**: This.
**Jdawson**: This is what we were trying to figure out, so.
**Ashton**: Yeah.
**Ashton**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And if we're changing, I don't.
**Jdawson**: I don't need it right now.
**Ashton**: Yeah, I just.
**Ashton**: I mean, we.
**Ashton**: When they added that beer wall in Liberty, we added a second walk in to the building to accommodate it.
**Ashton**: So I don't know how that would.
**Ashton**: I don't know how we would make that work in this space.
**Ashton**: But I'll talk with Mike, I'll talk with ownership about it and see what they're.
**Ashton**: You know.
**Jdawson**: I mean, here's.
**Jdawson**: Here's an idea, I guess, but I don't know if that's exterior framing we have.
**Jdawson**: I don't know how much bigger it's got to go, but if we can't stretch into the storage, we can pull this wall out a little bit.
**Ashton**: Yeah, that would be.
**Ashton**: I mean, that, that would work.
**Ashton**: We're not going to get enough stretching into that storage, I don't think.
**Ashton**: But if we could.
**Ashton**: If, if we could get something close to what your.
**Ashton**: What.
**Ashton**: What's out.
**Ashton**: What's on the back side of that there?
**Jdawson**: The patio.
**Ashton**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Patio space.
**Ashton**: I mean, the other thing we could do and we could is you could.
**Ashton**: We could do a walk in box that went.
**Ashton**: We could do a separate walk in box that went outside.
**Ashton**: And I mean, you can get them built where the out.
**Ashton**: You know, it looks like finished wall on the outside where you wouldn't have to expand your actual structure.
**Ashton**: The walking could be its own outdoor structure that feeds it.
**Jdawson**: Then they'd have to go out outside to go into there.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, they're gonna be this cooler.
**Jdawson**: They have to go all the way out here.
**Jdawson**: Walk all the way down the hallway.
**Ashton**: Yeah.
**Ashton**: I mean, we could put a door on the.
**Ashton**: Yeah, yeah.
**Ashton**: It.
**Ashton**: Just a thought, but yeah, I mean if you could expand in the wall and expand in the walk in that way would probably be the.
**Ashton**: You know, that, that would work for sure.
**Ashton**: So.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Well, yeah, when you talk to Mike, I mean.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, this one would have implications with the exterior.
**Jdawson**: We don't want to.
**Jdawson**: We don't want to get into that if we don't have to.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Ashton**: No, understood.
**Jdawson**: If, if we do.
**Jdawson**: I think we can.
**Jdawson**: I don't.
**Jdawson**: I mean, obviously we're not gonna move these columns.
**Jdawson**: I think we can use exterior framing and just.
**Jdawson**: Well, this is going to get Gertz because this is metal wall.
**Jdawson**: Oh, no, this is that wood.
**Jdawson**: Never mind.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, this is just masonry and wood siding.
**Jdawson**: Oh, this is just all exterior framing, honestly.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we can.
**Ashton**: I'll have my CAD guy mess with a little bit and see what sizing we think, you know, and just kind of do a rendering and see what we see what it looks like and then see what everyone thinks.
**Nbigler**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Jdawson**: Anything else from anybody?
**Jdawson**: I think we're good.
**Gdesmit**: Chad.
**Gdesmit**: Chad.
**Jdawson**: I don't.
**Ashton**: All right, guys, I gotta hop off everything.
**Ashton**: Thanks.
**Nbigler**: Sorry.
**Awoodhams**: What's that, Nick?
**Gdesmit**: I think everything's being condensed to 623.
**Gdesmit**: I'll let you know if that changes.
**Gdesmit**: Yeah, it looks like it's still going to be like a long day of unloading on 623.
**Gdesmit**: Maybe eight, seven, eight loads.
**Jdawson**: So Nick, let me ask you.
**Jdawson**: This Warrior VP gave me what?
**Jdawson**: That's the same song and dance your VP gave me.
**Jdawson**: So Nick, let me ask you if, if that were the case, what's is there, is there the ability to sequence the trucks so that truck one shows up and they pick it and start erecting on the southwest corner where they're planning to start.
**Jdawson**: And as the other trucks arrive, they can get unloaded and staged.
**Gdesmit**: You know Glenn, in a perfect world that would make a whole lot of sense.
**Gdesmit**: But you know how these truck drivers are.
**Gdesmit**: You giving us chat, 8 o' clock in my face, the 8 o' clock one, he's going to be staying the night somewhere and he's not going to show up until 10:30 the next day.
**Gdesmit**: Like these truck drivers.
**Gdesmit**: Man, it is probably my least favorite thing about the business.
**Jdawson**: As long as our roof trusses are here first.
**Gdesmit**: Yeah, I mean, I don't know.
**Gdesmit**: Yeah, I don't know if we'll have a specific like, hey, this load of structural steel because it'll basically give weights.
**Gdesmit**: It'll say what, you know, how much each truck's gonna weigh.
**Gdesmit**: But I'm not gonna know exactly what columns are on each one unless something's changed as far as what specifically, like what part numbers are on each manifest.
**Gdesmit**: I'll dig into it.
**Jdawson**: That would just.
**Jdawson**: That would save a couple days of shakeout.
**Gdesmit**: Yeah.
**Gdesmit**: I mean as long as we have a good lay down area from Chad, we'll be able to adjust very quickly depending on what truck shows up.
**Gdesmit**: You know, because we want the roof panels to be tucked in into a corner.
**Gdesmit**: Right.
**Gdesmit**: Because we're going to use them last.
**Gdesmit**: So like there's things that we do.
**Gdesmit**: I'm just a sales guy, but I know that, you know, we have our preferences obviously about how we lay things down, but.
**Jdawson**: Well, the sooner that you can get that get out there now that the pads built and the more equip.
**Jdawson**: More stuff you can put on the pad for your layout will help us because we got, we're trying to the weather and the clock on getting our water in our parking lot done.
**Gdesmit**: Oh, I mean the more stuff that we can put on the pad would be beneficial for us.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: My idea was to put all of the volleyball framing all the volleyball on the east side of the pad, and then you just pick it and put it up.
**Gdesmit**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Pick it up on the right.
**Jdawson**: Place on the left.
**Jdawson**: Move over.
**Jdawson**: Pick it up from the right.
**Jdawson**: Put on the left and.
**Jdawson**: And scoot down.
**Jdawson**: That would take.
**Jdawson**: That would keep most of our stuff off of the.
**Jdawson**: Off of the parking lot area.
**Jdawson**: But that's something for your guy and.
**Jdawson**: And Chad to figure out.
**Jdawson**: But that's.
**Jdawson**: That's the idea now that this is pushed out this far into the summer.
**Gdesmit**: Yep.
**Gdesmit**: So I think we'll be at that meeting.
**Gdesmit**: What?
**Gdesmit**: We got a side meeting next week, early in the week.
**Gdesmit**: Tuesday, 8am Tuesday, 8am so we'll be there for that one.
**Jdawson**: What's that?
**Jdawson**: Week.
**Jdawson**: A week out from before getting on site.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah, then.
**Jdawson**: And then all the.
**Jdawson**: For the duration, we'll do.
**Jdawson**: That's our weekly sub coordination for anybody who's coming on or is on site.
**Jdawson**: All right, I'm gonna hop off here.
**Jdawson**: I'm gonna check on Mayor.
**Gdesmit**: All right, we'll see you.
**Jdawson**: See you guys.
**Jdawson**: See you.
**Nbigler**: So I.
**Jdawson**: It sa.
