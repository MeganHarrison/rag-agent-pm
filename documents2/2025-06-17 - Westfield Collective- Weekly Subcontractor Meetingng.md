**Rthompson**: How you doing this morning?
**Zach**: I'm good.

**Ikaase**: Is this the meeting today?
**Brhoades**: Yeah.
**Brhoades**: Well.
**Rthompson**: Morning.
**Cmcdaniel**: Good morning Chad, the other side of the trailer.
**Zach**: We have somebody from lemaster on here.
**Rthompson**: Yes, we have Le Master, we have Merit, we have Chance with Howard Companies is here with me on site for Merit.
**Rthompson**: He's out on the building pad so he's joining remote.
**Brhoades**: Okay.
**Rthompson**: So the only one we're really missing is Dean and United.
**Rthompson**: They pull up the schedule really or the agenda really quick here.
**Zach**: That's X Ryan.
**Rthompson**: I.
**Rthompson**: Ben's on his way out today sometime so.
**Rthompson**: So going through the agenda.
**Rthompson**: Water main tap.
**Rthompson**: Have we got any update on the encroachment permit Glenn, besides last week that they said that we'd have it this week.
**Zach**: They are working on getting the agreement drafted up.
**Zach**: Should be ready by the end of this week she said and I need to give them a copy of the deed which I've asked the owners for and I'm getting a slow response.
**Rthompson**: Okay.
**Zach**: So as long as I can get that sounds like we'll have our agreement, whatever that means by the end of the week.
**Zach**: Then somebody signs that.
**Zach**: Sure.
**Zach**: We'll have to go sign it in front of a notary and a judge and the Reverend Jesse Jackson and then turn it in in person on a thumb drive and a floppy disk.
**Rthompson**: So are we still expecting it next week?
**Zach**: I am expecting it next week.
**Zach**: I don't know if it'll be Monday but I expecting to have the agreement this week at least and if that has to go to the owners for something then you know, get that back Friday afternoon, Monday.
**Zach**: I don't, I don't know what's.
**Zach**: I don't know what, what is going to be required of the agreement.
**Zach**: I'll ask when I send the deed.
**Rthompson**: Okay.
**Rthompson**: Because we've got United scheduled on 626 to do the water bore so we've got to have that by then.
**Zach**: Site.
**Rthompson**: Work, everything's been cut to grade.
**Rthompson**: Now we just got to get gas line, water line in and then we can lime stabilize after Dean does their underground also which they are supposed to be on site today to start that next item is beam.
**Rthompson**: They did mobilize in yesterday.
**Rthompson**: They're going to start on the primary and then they'll from that they'll jump over to the light pole bases.
**Rthompson**: I've told them to run everything at a minimum of 2 foot depth since we are going to have to line out here and that's going to make us and that if they don't go deep enough then we're going to get into there.
**Zach**: So.
**Rthompson**: Foundations merit is currently on those.
**Rthompson**: They're out there digging as we're speaking.
**Rthompson**: They'll be wrapping up everything hopefully by mid next week.
**Rthompson**: Still package Mark is on here.
**Rthompson**: Mark, you're coming to the site today with your safety guy.
**Brhoades**: Yes.
**Rthompson**: You have an idea what time you guys will be here?
**Brhoades**: I'm not sure.
**Brhoades**: I'm not sure what time Brian's going to get here.
**Brhoades**: I'll give you a call and give you a heads up.
**Rthompson**: All right, so see here, really quick, pull up the drawings.
**Rthompson**: Where are you wanting to stage your crane at to start with, Is this a mobilized crane or is this.
**Rthompson**: It's going to sit in one spot, the whole whole job mobilized.
**Brhoades**: It's a 30 ton Terex all terrain.
**Brhoades**: As far as setting up, I believe last time we met we were going to set up and start in the dining.
**Rthompson**: Yes.
**Rthompson**: That's our order of sequences.
**Rthompson**: We're starting down on that end.
**Rthompson**: Give me a second.
**Rthompson**: I'm pulling up the drawings right now.
**Rthompson**: We can just go over this really quick.
**Zach**: Speaking of which, while we're doing that, markers, is there a crane plan coming?
**Brhoades**: Yes.
**Brhoades**: Yep.
**Brhoades**: We'll have it out there today.
**Zach**: Okay.
**Zach**: Is your intent to start or have the crane operate from within the pad?
**Brhoades**: Yes.
**Brhoades**: Okay.
**Zach**: And the start in the volleyball.
**Zach**: We'll stage it in the volleyball.
**Rthompson**: So Mark, are you thinking you're going to set about right here where it says proposed building?
**Rthompson**: Yeah.
**Brhoades**: Yep.
**Rthompson**: So when you do that or do you want to use a good amount of this area over here since there's no column pads to do a lay down area for you also?
**Ikaase**: Yeah, yeah, that'd be great.
**Rthompson**: And then if we need, I mean, we can always state some out front here a little bit.
**Rthompson**: And then we've got this whole lot over here.
**Ikaase**: Okay.
**Rthompson**: This parking lot over here to the east.
**Cmcdaniel**: Parking lot on the east side for lay down.
**Rthompson**: Well, let's put as much as we can up on the building pad.
**Rthompson**: I mean staying back of course from the edges, but then that way any overflow we can always stage over here.
**Brhoades**: Okay.
**Zach**: We're trying to get that parking lot in though.
**Zach**: So if you do source up in that parking lot, have it, have it be stuff that's going up in the first couple weeks.
**Cmcdaniel**: Troubles have to remember.
**Cmcdaniel**: Yeah.
**Rthompson**: Or whatever's on the parking lot.
**Rthompson**: Once the pad's open, let's move it to the pad.
**Brhoades**: Okay.
**Zach**: Yeah, I know you guys don't have a lot of control over sequencing how the, how the metal shows up on site.
**Zach**: It's not like you can.
**Zach**: Nick said you can't really show up in, you know, truck one is the stuff you're erecting first in a perfect world.
**Zach**: That'd be nice, right, Mark?
**Brhoades**: Oh, yeah.
**Zach**: Be sweet.
**Rthompson**: Okay, so that takes care of Mark.
**Rthompson**: Chance is here with me on site.
**Rthompson**: So we are lime stabilizing the parking lot.
**Rthompson**: We're gonna have to kind of date.
**Zach**: You got on that.
**Rthompson**: We're looking to start stabilizing it possibly about end of June.
**Rthompson**: Once Merit's done with the foundations on the building, you guys can just roll right into the foundations for the dumpster enclosure and then the foundation for the monument sign.
**Cmcdaniel**: Yeah, we can do that.
**Rthompson**: This.
**Rthompson**: That way you guys can get that done before you get out of here.
**Cmcdaniel**: Sounds like a plan.
**Zach**: Line stabilization.
**Zach**: Ryan with United had set it up to basically end at the northern edge of the trail.
**Rthompson**: End at the northern edge of the trail.
**Zach**: Yeah.
**Zach**: Or.
**Zach**: Yeah, into the northern edge of the trail, basically before all of the utilities start there.
**Zach**: So if you look at our civil plan on the C401.
**Zach**: Well, any of them that's.
**Rthompson**: Opening up right now, the northern edge of the trail that runs north south through the northern edge of the trail that runs east, west.
**Zach**: East west.
**Zach**: At our construction entrance.
**Zach**: Well, at our entrance.
**Rthompson**: So he's going to stop the lime over here, is that what you're saying?
**Zach**: Well, I mean, at the.
**Zach**: At the entrance.
**Zach**: He's not liming that landscaping zone, but yes, there stop.
**Zach**: They'll stop at the trail.
**Zach**: Yeah, or maybe a little bit of the trail.
**Zach**: But we're not going into the.
**Zach**: Into the lanes coming in.
**Zach**: So if we need to do any type of.
**Zach**: Not stabilization or.
**Zach**: Or proof roll and have to do something.
**Zach**: We'll have to use something geogrid or we'll have to undercut and do stone something for the asl D cell lane and the entrance.
**Zach**: Drive right there.
**Rthompson**: No, we do not.
**Zach**: I'm trying to find the picture, but he.
**Zach**: He texted to me what I'm looking at, so.
**Zach**: And he edited it even since he sent me this.
**Zach**: But yeah, start stopping at the northern edge of the trail would be the end of our line.
**Rthompson**: Correct.
**Zach**: Maybe a little bit of the trail.
**Zach**: So does that.
**Rthompson**: When anything out here that I just boxed that.
**Rthompson**: We do not control what we do out there.
**Rthompson**: That whole area.
**Rthompson**: We do not get to decide what happens there.
**Zach**: Yeah.
**Zach**: In the right of way.
**Ikaase**: So that comes.
**Rthompson**: All that comes from Carlton Howard.
**Rthompson**: He has to do the proof roll.
**Rthompson**: He has to.
**Rthompson**: And then if it fails, he'll tell us how he wants it remediated.
**Brhoades**: Right.
**Zach**: So that being said, Howard, is what's.
**Zach**: What, what is your, what's your thought on how this is going to go with that gas line being right there at the edge of the road and us having to mill down and then, you know, cut in this Excel diesel lane on top of that gas.
**Rthompson**: Chance.
**Rthompson**: I'm sorry, so you've got a gas line that runs parallel with this road right here.
**Rthompson**: Say it.
**Rthompson**: So ask your question again, Glenn.
**Zach**: What, what is, what's your thought on how this, how this is going to go with this city and the gas company having that, having that line there?
**Zach**: Right.
**Zach**: You know, right under where we're going to have to mill and resurface to the edge of the road.
**Zach**: And then the gas line runs where the edge of the road meets the current shoulder.
**Zach**: And we're going to be widening that to put our acl.
**Zach**: Diesel lines are going to be operating on top of all of those utilities.
**Zach**: But mainly they're, they're pressurized gas main.
**Ikaase**: Do we know an approximate depth on any on that gas line?
**Rthompson**: 30 some inches.
**Rthompson**: 32 to 36.
**Ikaase**: So it'd still be another what, 20, 15, 20 inches below grade.
**Rthompson**: Yeah, that gas lines, that green line there, basically.
**Ikaase**: And we're not stabilizing any of that.
**Brhoades**: Correct.
**Rthompson**: We don't know that all this will come from the city of Westfield direct.
**Brhoades**: Okay.
**Rthompson**: The same thing with the path.
**Rthompson**: When we do the path, we'll have to proof roll it.
**Rthompson**: City of Westfield has to be here.
**Rthompson**: If it fails, they'll tell us you either need to align it or you need to, you know, two layers of geogrid and six inch lifts, I would.
**Ikaase**: Say excluding the stabilization.
**Ikaase**: I don't know that they would give us a whole lot of problem on it.
**Ikaase**: They didn't over there on that project.
**Ikaase**: And they even stabilized over one of the lines.
**Rthompson**: Who was their gas company.
**Rthompson**: Was it center point or was I put in?
**Ikaase**: I can't remember.
**Ikaase**: I'll be completely honest with you because I think most of that was handled before I actually acquired the project.
**Ikaase**: So I only got tail into the information.
**Brhoades**: Okay.
**Zach**: So the gas line, where it crosses that road, where it crosses our entrance here.
**Zach**: Let me take the screen real quick.
**Zach**: J comes in here at nine hundred and a half feet and our general elevation around is.
**Zach**: Is 904 or so.
**Zach**: So the top of, let's see, existing gray top of asphalt is 903.
**Zach**: It's just under three feet deep.
**Zach**: Looks like probably 3:20.
**Zach**: What's.2 0.2 inches, like quarter of an inch, something like that.
**Zach**: All right, so we got about three feet, just under.
**Zach**: Three feet from top asphalt.
**Zach**: How deep.
**Zach**: How deep are we gonna have to cut down?
**Zach**: Start putting our base back in and our road back in.
**Brhoades**: There.
**Zach**: Should only be.
**Ikaase**: I mean, We've got a 6 inch asphalt profile and then whatever the excavation is going to be, I can't imagine it'd be any more than another six, eight inches, right?
**Rthompson**: Yeah.
**Ikaase**: We don't have the excavation on our end, so profile is just six inches.
**Rthompson**: What's your asphalt and stone together?
**Ikaase**: Asphalt profile.
**Ikaase**: That's my fault.
**Ikaase**: Stone six, asphalt five.
**Rthompson**: So we're gonna go down 11 inches with ours.
**Rthompson**: So we're still gonna be two feet above that gas line.
**Rthompson**: Yeah.
**Zach**: Awesome.
**Zach**: Okay, so that's part.
**Zach**: That's part of our encroachment thing.
**Zach**: You know, the.
**Zach**: The guy that came out stopped us from driving our trucks and loaded dump trucks and stuff over the entrance until we put that steel plate down.
**Zach**: The thing is three feet underground, so I can't freaking find.
**Brhoades**: Here we go.
**Zach**: Eight inches of stone, four and a half inches of surface.
**Rthompson**: That's for our parking lot.
**Rthompson**: You need the city of Westfield detail.
**Zach**: The duty.
**Zach**: Heavy duty concrete.
**Zach**: Is it the heavy duty?
**Rthompson**: That's ours.
**Rthompson**: Do you need city of Westfield standard.
**Zach**: Five, six and a half inches plus six inches aggregate.
**Zach**: So 12 and a half inches.
**Zach**: Pictures.
**Ikaase**: I my takeoff and everything shows six and five.
**Zach**: Six is down.
**Ikaase**: Five of the basketball.
**Zach**: We got six stone, two and a half binder, two and a half intermediate, and one and a half surface.
**Zach**: This is local.
**Zach**: This is the collector street.
**Zach**: This should be the typical pavement section.
**Ikaase**: Yeah, it is.
**Ikaase**: Five, five and one and a half.
**Ikaase**: That's my fault.
**Cmcdaniel**: Yep.
**Zach**: Sorry.
**Rthompson**: So 12 and a half.
**Zach**: Yes.
**Rthompson**: Which we're already.
**Rthompson**: We're still.
**Rthompson**: I mean, we're building that up.
**Rthompson**: You know, when you come off that road right now, Glenn, you drop.
**Rthompson**: It's not.
**Rthompson**: You're not going to be dropping.
**Rthompson**: You're going to be raising as you come in.
**Rthompson**: So we're going to be fine on the depth.
**Zach**: It's still 903 right there.
**Zach**: Same thing.
**Zach**: 903 and a half.
**Zach**: 937.
**Zach**: Three quarters at the top of curb.
**Zach**: But yes, we still have two extra feet.
**Cmcdaniel**: Cool.
**Zach**: So, yeah, we'll get that line stabilization.
**Zach**: Hopefully Centerpoint gets us our agreement stuff so we can get that knocked out with them into this week and then they can schedule their new service and simultaneously run their water line.
**Zach**: Service they run next to each other.
**Zach**: Here's the gas line or water line, and there's the gas Line coming in.
**Zach**: That's it.
**Zach**: Sorry.
**Zach**: Go ahead, keep going.
**Rthompson**: I believe that's everybody.
**Zach**: Okay.
**Rthompson**: Mark, is.
**Rthompson**: Is it going to be affect you guys at all if they're out here running the bore in the water line while you guys are on the building pad?
**Rthompson**: They're going to be in the parking lot.
**Rthompson**: So it should not hurt you at all.
**Brhoades**: No, it shouldn't.
**Rthompson**: Okay, so shortly besides that, I think that's it.
**Rthompson**: Does anybody got any questions or need anything from the Alito Group?
**Zach**: Is Kegan Kagan's on here?
**Rthompson**: Yeah.
**Zach**: What's up buddy?
**Cmcdaniel**: What's going on?
**Zach**: Oh, you know, curious if I could get the last submittal that I need from you for welded wire.
**Zach**: Wire mesh?
**Cmcdaniel**: Yeah, I've got it.
**Cmcdaniel**: I received it yesterday.
**Cmcdaniel**: So I can shoot that over to you here today.
**Zach**: Okay.
**Zach**: Last thing is the admix that we discussed.
**Zach**: Chad, where are we at with getting that to Kagan or getting it from?
**Rthompson**: I'm just waiting on Kagan to send it to you.
**Cmcdaniel**: Yep.
**Cmcdaniel**: I just need to receive those from Shelby.
**Cmcdaniel**: They just sent me yesterday a high early like a complete different mix.
**Cmcdaniel**: But I just need to get the ad mixture information from them.
**Rthompson**: And then you need to get Glenn a price per dose.
**Cmcdaniel**: Yes.
**Cmcdaniel**: Yep.
**Zach**: Is that you guys are planning on pouring today as of now, right?
**Cmcdaniel**: So far, yeah.
**Zach**: Is it.
**Cmcdaniel**: This rain can hold out on us.
**Zach**: Are we trying to get that admix in there starting today?
**Rthompson**: It would probably behoove us too.
**Zach**: Okay.
**Zach**: All right.
**Cmcdaniel**: Yeah, I'll just have to dose it on the side.
**Brhoades**: Okay.
**Zach**: Well, let me.
**Zach**: Yeah.
**Brhoades**: Get.
**Zach**: Get me that stuff this morning so I can give the Jerrica a chance to take a look at in case she has any issues.
**Zach**: I'm sure she won't, but what are we doing?
**Zach**: What's the admix?
**Zach**: Just a speed up for an internal cure or what?
**Rthompson**: Yes, the spring.
**Cmcdaniel**: More than likely it'll probably be dci.
**Zach**: All right, send me that over as soon as you.
**Zach**: As soon as you can, Kagan.
**Zach**: And other than that, you don't have anything else?
**Zach**: I think we're good for the week.
**Rthompson**: Guys, do you have all submittals from everybody on this call?
**Rthompson**: Besides the ones that Kaganosia Kagan owes me one.
**Zach**: Howard is.
**Zach**: I believe we're done with Howard.
**Zach**: If anything that the MOT plan might still be.
**Zach**: No, I closed that out because they approved our right away permit.
**Zach**: So do you have the MOT plan?
**Zach**: Chase?
**Zach**: Chance.
**Rthompson**: Yes.
**Zach**: Chase or Chance?
**Rthompson**: Chance.
**Zach**: Chance.
**Zach**: Do you have the MOT plan?
**Ikaase**: I do have that.
**Brhoades**: Okay.
**Zach**: You guys provided it so, yeah, it.
**Ikaase**: Should be in one of those email chains that Alex sent out.
**Cmcdaniel**: Okay.
**Ikaase**: But I do have it with me here.
**Brhoades**: All right, perfect.
**Rthompson**: Which right now would be the time to do it.
**Ikaase**: Yeah, we can get it set up whenever.
**Rthompson**: All right.
**Zach**: Signage.
**Zach**: Yeah.
**Zach**: It would be great to do it freaking now when they're.
**Zach**: They wouldn't let us close down the road at all, even for a week.
**Zach**: But they're closing down the road for how?
**Zach**: For however long.
**Zach**: To do their roundabout on the next intersection over.
**Zach**: I don't think they wanted to coordinate with us to do it all at the same time.
**Zach**: Oh, well.
**Rthompson**: All right.
**Rthompson**: You got anything you need to add?
**Rthompson**: No.
**Rthompson**: Andrew?
**Cmcdaniel**: No.
**Rthompson**: All right.
**Rthompson**: Thank you, guys.
**Brhoades**: See you.
**Rthompson**: Sam.
