**Jcurtin**: Hey, good morning, Jack.
**Jcurtin**: How's it going today?
**Jdawson**: Hello.
**Jcurtin**: What do you have going on today on, on the job site?
**Jdawson**: Hello?
**Jcurtin**: You can't hear me?
**Jdawson**: I can hear you.
**Jcurtin**: What do you have going on today on the job site?
**Jdawson**: Framing up underneath the canopy.
**Jdawson**: The footings are filled with water, so that's got to be pumped out.
**Jdawson**: I don't know if we'll make inspection.
**Jcurtin**: Is the inspector going to be showing up at 9am it's not going to be ready?
**Jdawson**: No.
**Jdawson**: It's 7:20 now and the whole thing is caked in water.
**Jcurtin**: Did they had install their forms in rebar yesterday?
**Jdawson**: Nah, they were going to finish up the rest this morning.
**Jcurtin**: You're not able to pump it out and get it ready?
**Jdawson**: He has my pump.
**Jcurtin**: Well, he is.
**Jcurtin**: So he's not showing up this morning?
**Jdawson**: I don't know.
**Jdawson**: I've been running around taking care of some other things.
**Jdawson**: I haven't had a chance to call him yet.
**Jcurtin**: That's probably the most important thing.
**Jcurtin**: If the city inspector shows up and it's not ready, he's going to be pissed.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Can we cut this short and because I got the flooring guy that wants some stuff moved too.
**Jdawson**: So we may have to make this really quick.
**Jdawson**: And I, and I get to calling everybody, calling Rick and helping the flooring guy.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: And with the, he's framing the ceiling today.
**Jcurtin**: Are, did you check with the light layout?
**Jcurtin**: Is, is he going to coordinate it with the electrician.
**Jdawson**: The framer?
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Jcurtin**: They gotta make sure those guys are talking to each other because if, if he frames it and it doesn't work with the light layout, they'll have to reframe it.
**Jdawson**: Correct?
**Jdawson**: Yes, we've, we've all been coordinating that.
**Jdawson**: But the thing that is going to hold Kevin up is we still don't have an answer on where that sign's going to go.
**Jcurtin**: No, I sent an answer yesterday.
**Jcurtin**: I emailed it to him and you.
**Jdawson**: Perfect.
**Jdawson**: I'll look.

**Jdawson**: Oh, yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that's what we're looking like.
**Jcurtin**: Are you going to get a schedule updated?
