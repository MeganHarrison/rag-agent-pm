## Transcript
**Aelkarrimy**: That it might go to spam and.
**Bclymer**: What?
**Aelkarrimy**: Hey, Yousuke.
**Aelkarrimy**: How are you, man?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I'm good.
**Aelkarrimy**: Just a quick question.
**Aelkarrimy**: Were you able to access Job Planner, the website?
**Aelkarrimy**: No, not yet.
**Kevin.ly**: You still don't have any link?
**Jdawson**: The link.
**Aelkarrimy**: You'Re supposed to receive an invite, Yusuke, from Job Planner, where it asks you to create an account.
**Aelkarrimy**: It asks you for your first name, last name.
**Aelkarrimy**: Even though Keva probably added all of that.
**Aelkarrimy**: You just need to confirm the account and then you're added onto it.
**Aelkarrimy**: And that would give you access to that portal that I showed you on Monday.
**Kevin.ly**: I can.
**Kevin.ly**: I can send one right now.
**Jdawson**: I got the daily report submitted.
**Jdawson**: No noticed email.
**Jdawson**: This.
**Aelkarrimy**: Oh, perfect.
**Aelkarrimy**: Click that.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah, click that link and it should lead.
**Aelkarrimy**: Well, no, don't click the link.
**Aelkarrimy**: Save your report.
**Mparsons**: So that it leads.
**Aelkarrimy**: You to the website instead.
**Aelkarrimy**: Because when you hit the link.
**Aelkarrimy**: Ah, yes, yes.
**Jdawson**: Finally.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I got the PDF.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah, thank you.
**Bryan.wagar**: Awesome.
**Aelkarrimy**: All right, I think we've got the entire crowd and we can get started.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Are you starting things or what are we doing?
**Kevin.ly**: Sure, I can start.
**Kevin.ly**: Is everyone here?
**Bryan.wagar**: So.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: You'Re going to share your screen, Kevin, if you have an agenda.
**Bschwartz**: Yeah.
**Bschwartz**: All right.
**Kevin.ly**: Start with the permitting status.
**Kevin.ly**: Mike was able to pick up the permits yesterday.
**Kevin.ly**: I sent it out to everyone and I have.
**Kevin.ly**: I have attached them to the agenda here.
**Kevin.ly**: If anyone didn't see the emails.
**Kevin.ly**: So you can have access.
**Kevin.ly**: And this is just sent to the chat for the meeting and for change orders.
**Kevin.ly**: So we currently are.
**Kevin.ly**: Sorry.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah, but if you go above there first, like.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So the electricians, if you want to just mic, you can give us a rundown of what's going on on site.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: So we had the electrician get on site today and mostly walk the site, reviewed plans, we got the lift inside and then went ahead.
**Bclymer**: So they were under the Dean was under the impression that with the forward mediation that the.
**Bclymer**: It would be marked where.
**Bclymer**: Exactly where those lights need to be at.
**Bclymer**: And that's not the case.
**Bclymer**: The center lines are marked, so.
**Bclymer**: And according to the plans, our lights are right above those center lines.
**Bclymer**: I want to say it's every three rows of the racks, but we have where the lights are going, so we're going to mark that up on the whole floor before officially relocating those on plan B.
**Bclymer**: Or, sorry, plan A.
**Bryan.wagar**: Just to let everybody know, the floor markings are not coming until the last week of July.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Right, right, right.
**Bclymer**: Dean.
**Bclymer**: They were under the impression that it was already going to be marked up exactly where they need to be.
**Bclymer**: But like I said, the center lines are Marked.
**Bclymer**: And that's where our lights are being, are going to be going in these aisles, every three aisles.
**Bclymer**: So we're going to get that marked up, ready to start that for plan A.
**Bclymer**: And then the new lights for plan B will be on site next week.
**Bclymer**: So that's where we're at on that.
**Bclymer**: And we also walk down the Runway for the power room and confirm that.
**Bclymer**: That see, are you pulling up, pulling up those pictures, Kevin?
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: I know that was a concern we had.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So you met with the facilities folks and the electricians you got together and they can pass by while they're working with these feeders?
**Bclymer**: No, not with that.
**Bclymer**: We need to get with Uniqlo about that.
**Bclymer**: This is just with the electrician.
**Bclymer**: But I'm saying this run here, we were able to run in the middle of this, this road here.
**Bclymer**: So we're not going to be too, we don't, we don't need to be too up against the wall or up against the racks.
**Bclymer**: We.
**Bclymer**: And there's not, there's no action going on in this, in that long Runway.
**Bclymer**: So the, the majority of that, that run we're going to be.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Who, like, is there someone there they should be talking to so they can.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: It's on site.
**Bclymer**: Would that be Ted?
**Bclymer**: Uck, I would assume it's 10.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Ted.
**Bclymer**: Okay, I'll get, I'll get with him and confirm all, all of this like.
**Bclymer**: And then closer to the power room, that's where we will need to coordinate and just make sure everybody's on the same page with when we're going to be there and how long we're going to be there.
**Bclymer**: According to the electrician, that, that work in that area won't take more than two or three days.
**Bclymer**: So if that's something we need to get in there extra early, that's something we can consider.
**Bclymer**: So yeah, that's where we're at on that run right there.
**Bschwartz**: There.
**Bclymer**: Any questions on that?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And when is that slated to start?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Like on our schedule right now.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: When would that start?
**Bclymer**: We have that July 3rd, it looks like.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So I just want to confirm you suke that like that we're good to go with that.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And I don't know if you want to follow up with your guy on site.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And you know, we're just.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: That's only a couple weeks away and we'll be getting started on that.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I want to have some like, exact schedule and dates.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And also the area you're using in after that, we're going to discuss internally and let you know it's accepted or not.
**Jdawson**: Because we're using that area for our normal operation.
**Jdawson**: So it's kind of.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, okay.
**Bclymer**: I'll get some details and more.
**Bclymer**: More pictures.
**Kevin.ly**: Not only the.
**Jdawson**: Not only the dates, but also the time.
**Jdawson**: Time slot too.
**Bschwartz**: Okay.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, I gotcha.
**Kevin.ly**: We can share that with you as we get closer to it.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And it's kind of.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: It's.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: It's tough to, like, mark a thing on a drawing and say, this is where it's going to be.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And that's why I would.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I would recommend they get with your guy on site, so you can actually kind of see they're like, this is what we're going to take up because it's such a.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: You know, it's a giant plan with a small sliver of.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Makes it look a lot smaller than it is.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So it would be good if they could get together on site there.
**Aelkarrimy**: So, Yasuke, should they just contact Ted Chesky, walk him through, maybe even prop one of the lifts in that aisle, Just so then the Aliato team can reflect how they're going to operate within that area.
**Aelkarrimy**: And if Ted Chesky says all good, then we're good to go.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: So Mike and Kevin, you guys have Ted's number, right?
**Bclymer**: Correct.
**Aelkarrimy**: Perfect.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: So, yeah, as long as you guys just walk him through it.
**Aelkarrimy**: When we were there surveying the entire day, I didn't see anything going through that area as well, so it might be a win, but we just need to confirm with Ted.
**Bclymer**: Sounds good.
**Kevin.ly**: All right, so moving on to change orders.
**Kevin.ly**: We have two change orders that we are currently working on.
**Kevin.ly**: There's one for plumbing, which added the oil separator to the project, and we are currently still pricing one for.
**Kevin.ly**: For the electric changes.
**Kevin.ly**: Couldn't get it in time because we just received the drawings, and our electrician is not in the office today, so we'll try to get that in by the end of the week.
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, that was my question.
**Bryan.wagar**: You think you'll be able to have the change order by the end of the week?
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah, that's what we're going to shoot for.
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay.
**Bryan.wagar**: As I said in the email.
**Bryan.wagar**: And.
**Bryan.wagar**: And we'll go over this after you go through everything.
**Bryan.wagar**: As I said in the email.
**Bryan.wagar**: Hold off.
**Bryan.wagar**: You do not order anything as of.
**Bryan.wagar**: As of yet.
**Bryan.wagar**: We are still trying to see if we can eliminate some of these transformers for you, but we do need to know, you know, if the.
**Bryan.wagar**: If the effort is going to be worth the cost.
**Bryan.wagar**: But I do want to go over a few Ideas that we do have with, with Brian after you're done with your updates today.
**Bryan.wagar**: But I do want to make it clear that there, there possibly is another change coming down.
**Bryan.wagar**: We'll know before July 4th.
**Bryan.wagar**: But I don't want to have anything committed and bought or purchased or anything like that until after we were confirmed on these power requirements.
**Bryan.wagar**: Because if equipment does need to change, power requirements will also need to change.
**Kevin.ly**: Right.
**Bryan.wagar**: But we do, but we do need to know how much, how much we're looking at at this moment for everything in the current state.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And you're talking about change ordering the new, like the latest revision equipment or wire.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Because all the other stuff was already ordered, you know, two months ago.
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: As soon as we were released, we ordered the, you know, the, the at the time of that, you know, what was on the original drawings for transformers and whatnot.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, but that hasn't, that hasn't changed in motion.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Right, right.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: That.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: That stuff still was, you know, it's probably already in their warehouse.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So we haven't ordered anything new though.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So we understand.
**Kevin.ly**: And also, Tim Haft brought to my attention that if we had to order new material, it might change the schedule because there is a lead time six to eight weeks, just so you guys are aware of.
**Kevin.ly**: So we might need to adjust the schedule when we get to that and we have to order new material.
**Bryan.wagar**: Are you saying transformers are possibly six to eight weeks?
**Kevin.ly**: Correct.
**Kevin.ly**: Okay, so that's.
**Kevin.ly**: I guess I just talked about that.
**Kevin.ly**: If we have to order new transformers or panels, it might add to the schedule.
**Kevin.ly**: So the current schedule we are still working.
**Kevin.ly**: Well, we just started the relocating the lights and that should be going on for the next two for this week and the following week.
**Kevin.ly**: And we are bringing in the high bay lights so we will start installing those as well.
**Kevin.ly**: And the floor remediation is probably going to be done by Friday.
**Kevin.ly**: I think they were supposed to be done today, but they're saying maybe Friday they would be out of there.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, Oral Saturday, I heard.
**Kevin.ly**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, they said by the end of the week, so possibly Saturday.
**Kevin.ly**: All right.
**Kevin.ly**: There's no billing yet except for the last one we sent over.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Are we going to hold off on submitting those electrical.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Anything revised on electrical as well?
**Kevin.ly**: Yes, we are holding on until we get a final.
**Kevin.ly**: So for now Tim is working on repricing and I guess once we send that to you guys and we have a determination we can move forward and add to the submittal or make changes and send it or send it back.
**Aelkarrimy**: Kevin, I left you a message in the chat.
**Aelkarrimy**: If you can just add Benjamin Schwartz to the job planner for submittals and RFIs as well, that would be great.
**Aelkarrimy**: And Yusuke, question for you.
**Aelkarrimy**: The that those.
**Aelkarrimy**: The panel that we were coordinating, installing it outside of the area of work, has that been confirmed with the tenant that we're all good to install as is?
**Jdawson**: I got email today, but give me a second.
**Jdawson**: Okay, well, you can go ahead.
**Jdawson**: I'll just search the email I got.
**Aelkarrimy**: Today and then another item.
**Aelkarrimy**: So, Keba and Jesse, we're hearing obviously that there's more changes that could potentially hold off the issuance of the drawings.
**Aelkarrimy**: Did you still want us to hold off the structural updates as well as the architectural updates until we have Henderson's revision, or do you want us to submit independently and then they follow with.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Their set what is all on them?
**Aelkarrimy**: Life safety stuff in the architectural.
**Aelkarrimy**: And then the structural just has the supports for the conduits and all the runs on the happening on the.
**Aelkarrimy**: From the space.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So is.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I don't think that matters for the electrician on the conduit support.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And is it anything when you say life safety, are they moving exit signs or something that the electricians would rough in some?
**Aelkarrimy**: Shifted a little.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah.
**Aelkarrimy**: So that's why I don't want you to do the exits, the exit signs just yet because the gates were relocated on the fence.
**Aelkarrimy**: On the final fence of Exotex.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Have you sent us just an unofficial copy of those?
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah, you guys have that already.
**Aelkarrimy**: The progress.
**Aelkarrimy**: I sent you guys that a couple like a month ago, maybe not a month ago.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So then Mike, just make sure the electricians have that.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Those plans when they're roughing in, if that's what I mean.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Are we authorized to proceed with those changes in just locations?
**Aelkarrimy**: Well, Joe, any.
**Aelkarrimy**: Any further changes happening to the gates or are we good with.
**Bryan.wagar**: No, no, no.
**Bryan.wagar**: And.
**Bryan.wagar**: And again, I'm not saying this to alarm anybody and I don't want anybody to think that everything is changing.
**Bryan.wagar**: This is strictly based on.
**Bryan.wagar**: To be honest, this has to do with cardboard boxes.
**Bryan.wagar**: And depending on the cardboard boxes that get made in this upcoming week, will just the equipment or, sorry, the equipment, but the types of machinery that we use on the outbound side.
**Bryan.wagar**: So it doesn't change the Skypod, it doesn't change the impound.
**Bryan.wagar**: It will literally just be saying, hey, we're going to use this brand of machinery instead of this brand and it may have different power requirements.
**Bryan.wagar**: That's the only reason I bring it up at this very moment.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: But.
**Bryan.wagar**: I want to make sure that we have everything solidified before any new equipment gets ordered or anything gets returned at this moment.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Bryan.wagar**: But it will change anything as far as drawings permits, anything like that.
**Bryan.wagar**: It's literally just swapping out.
**Bryan.wagar**: We're going to use this supplier instead of this supplier because they make boxes in a different way.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: All right.
**Bryan.wagar**: And honestly, if we did do a different.
**Bryan.wagar**: If we did do it a different way, it might drop the power requirements as well, so.
**Bryan.wagar**: Because we'd use possibly less machinery.
**Bryan.wagar**: But again, it's all up in the air and I just want to make you aware of it before just so nothing gets ordered before we.
**Bryan.wagar**: Before we figure this out.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Understood.
**Kevin.ly**: Okay.
**Kevin.ly**: Yusuke, do you have more?
**Jdawson**: Ahmed?
**Jdawson**: Still not confirmed yet, but I think we can go with the original plan for like 70% but.
**Jdawson**: But not confirm the final decision yet with sublease area guy.
**Aelkarrimy**: Just let us know when you have that ready.
**Aelkarrimy**: So then Henderson finalizes their drawings.
**Aelkarrimy**: But regardless, I think we're going to have a good discussion now in a way where we can save on some of these costs that might be upcoming.
**Aelkarrimy**: And yeah, Cabba, do you have any other items you want to go over on the call?
**Kevin.ly**: No.
**Aelkarrimy**: Mike.
**Cheryl.green**: Hey, Yuzuki.
**Cheryl.green**: For payment one as far as in your guys's system and processing, is that on track to be paid next week.
**Jdawson**: For the payment?
**Jdawson**: Kevin, do you know about the status of this payment?
**Jdawson**: First payment?
**Daisuke.mine**: Yes, it's on track for payments.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I'll follow up with the team.
**Bryan.wagar**: Thank you.
**Bschwartz**: Sweet.
**Bryan.wagar**: Perfect.
**Aelkarrimy**: Do you have anything else you want.
**Bryan.wagar**: To go over on this call?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I'm good.
**Aelkarrimy**: All right.
**Jdawson**: We'll be marking on the floor for the additional.
**Jdawson**: Additional or relocating the lights.
**Bschwartz**: Right.
**Jdawson**: And I'm just worrying about like.
**Kevin.ly**: Floor.
**Jdawson**: Remediation is not completed yet.
**Jdawson**: And before completing, if you mark on the floor, what will be like?
**Jdawson**: Is that okay for flow remediation?
**Jdawson**: Like it's not completely yet.
**Jdawson**: They're gonna like just.
**Bryan.wagar**: Just an update is okay.
**Bryan.wagar**: The floor remediate, like the.
**Bryan.wagar**: The grinding right now is complete, is complete.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bryan.wagar**: So if they went and marked up the floor, it's.
**Bryan.wagar**: It's going to be fine if they need to.
**Bryan.wagar**: But the grinding is complete right now.
**Bryan.wagar**: They're just doing the.
**Bryan.wagar**: They're filling in the cracks per se.
**Bryan.wagar**: And then.
**Bryan.wagar**: And then I believe.
**Bryan.wagar**: And I'm.
**Bryan.wagar**: I'm getting confirmation on whether or not they've done the survey again or not.
**Bryan.wagar**: Because they do have to do another survey that shows that the remediation is.
**Bryan.wagar**: Has gotten us within specs.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: How about the friction?
**Bryan.wagar**: The friction?
**Bryan.wagar**: Oh, I Sent you the friction test a while back.
**Bryan.wagar**: They did the friction test before they did all the grinding and it, it passed.
**Bryan.wagar**: So we've already confirmed, we've already sent that to our team here as well and everybody said yes, this, this test has passed and there's no worries with friction.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so before the grinding, right?
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, they did it before the grinding.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And there's no chance that it will be more slippery after remediation, so not.
**Bryan.wagar**: Unless you guys go down there and polish it.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So there's no polish, so no problem.
**Kevin.ly**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: If there's no affected markups on the floor for relocating the lights, I have no concern.
**Kevin.ly**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: I'm good.
**Bryan.wagar**: I think we have nothing else.
**Bryan.wagar**: I have Cody on here that wants to run a few or maybe one scenario by you and I'm curious Brian, what your, what your thoughts would be and what this would change if we're able to do it.
**Bryan.wagar**: This is something.
**Bryan.wagar**: Again we're trying to reduce costs as much as possible.
**Bryan.wagar**: We don't know if it's, if it, it's, it's something that's kind of been brought up to us that could maybe be a possibility, but we're, we're still seeing how much effort it is actually going to entail.
**Bschwartz**: Okay, we're all yours.
**Daisuke.mine**: You guys can hear me?
**Bschwartz**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah, we got you, Cody.
**Daisuke.mine**: Awesome.
**Daisuke.mine**: Can you guys see my screen now?
**Aelkarrimy**: Yes, sir.
**Daisuke.mine**: Okay.
**Daisuke.mine**: Yeah, I took the most recent drawing that you sent over.
**Daisuke.mine**: Brian and I just went ahead and made some edits just based off of what we're kind of suggesting all of our conveyor power boxes.
**Daisuke.mine**: We were wondering what might happen if maybe we got rid of the transformer entirely and then just did a 480 volt drop directly to the power.
**Daisuke.mine**: So we would change, we would get rid of that transformer here in that north location and then down in the south we would end up taking these three locations and getting rid of those transformers as well and just have Those be straight 480 volt drops.
**Daisuke.mine**: Wasn't sure if that made things like too difficult or if that was like a good potential idea in terms of trying to get some savings in there.
**Daisuke.mine**: Kind of like Joe said, we're still kind of looking into it on our end, but it's something that we kind of thought about and are looking into.
**Bschwartz**: Yeah, let me just.
**Bschwartz**: So to confirm, not all the, the power boxes would be going to 480.
**Bschwartz**: There'd still be some at 400.
**Daisuke.mine**: Yeah.
**Daisuke.mine**: So all of the ones around Sky Pod.
**Daisuke.mine**: So like the two here that are still in red.
**Daisuke.mine**: And then like if I were to zoom out a little bit more.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And.
**Daisuke.mine**: Then the two up top, these two transformers, those would still exist.
**Daisuke.mine**: So this would just cut us from eight transformers down to four transformers.
**Bschwartz**: Okay, let me.
**Mparsons**: Let me try and find the power details, latest power details from you guys again.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, and that's kind of, you know, our question is is it as simple?
**Bryan.wagar**: I mean I'm sure it's not, but is it as simple as hey, you know, we take those transformers out, you know it saves almost 50% but you don't have, you know.
**Bryan.wagar**: But does that mean you have to change cabling or anything like that?
**Bschwartz**: Yeah.
**Bschwartz**: So that honestly is a simpler approach.
**Bschwartz**: Standard American voltages are 480, 277 and 208 120.
**Bschwartz**: We've already got 480, 277 at the HE1 panel at the back of the system.
**Bschwartz**: So that panel currently sits grid line 28B.
**Bschwartz**: So.
**Bschwartz**: Right.
**Bschwartz**: So I don't know how to mark up on, on teams yet.
**Mparsons**: It's to the, to the right there.
**Bschwartz**: To the right of those, those three doctors.
**Bschwartz**: Right, right to the left of that office space there.
**Daisuke.mine**: Right here?
**Bschwartz**: Yep.
**Bschwartz**: Essentially there.
**Bschwartz**: Yeah.
**Bschwartz**: So if you change all of those, if you change all the skypath convey inbound outbound conveyor system power boxes to 480 volt, that immediately eliminates four step down transformers that need to be installed.
**Bschwartz**: So you're going to have a savings there.
**Bschwartz**: The Sky Pod or excuse.
**Bschwartz**: Yeah, excuse me.
**Bschwartz**: The sky Pods are all sized at 75 KVA already in the original documents and we can stick with 75kvas for those moving forward.
**Bschwartz**: So shouldn't be any need to change those.
**Bschwartz**: So no add or saving additional cost or savings there.
**Bschwartz**: The only change that would we would have to do is we'd have to re.
**Bschwartz**: Let me think about this.
**Bschwartz**: I.
**Bschwartz**: What, what would change?
**Bschwartz**: Is the KVA still going to remain the same at 480 volt as it would at 400 volt or do you, do you know if that would have to increase?
**Daisuke.mine**: The KVAs would change slightly.
**Daisuke.mine**: That like I said, it's something we're still looking into and I haven't gotten that far yet.
**Daisuke.mine**: But the KVAS would change if we just did the 480 drop.
**Bschwartz**: Okay.
**Bschwartz**: Would they, would they increase or would they decrease?
**Bschwartz**: Do you know?
**Daisuke.mine**: I think they might have increased a little bit, but I can't fully answer that one right now.
**Daisuke.mine**: Sorry.
**Bschwartz**: Okay.
**Bschwartz**: Sorry.
**Bschwartz**: It's late in the day, my brain.
**Mparsons**: Isn'T working electrically today.
**Bschwartz**: A small increase In KVA should be fine.
**Bschwartz**: We, if it's too large of an increase in kva, we may have to increase the wire size a little bit.
**Daisuke.mine**: Do you know what the wire size is currently at?
**Daisuke.mine**: So that way when I look into it, I can see if we're like going over or not or if I need to like spec it a little bit differently.
**Bschwartz**: Yeah.
**Bschwartz**: Let me.
**Mparsons**: Where's our outpermit set?
**Cheryl.green**: Brian, real quick too keep in mind and for everybody, you know, we will.
**Cheryl.green**: You know, you cut out those four, you know, transformers or whatever, you'll save money on labor.
**Cheryl.green**: But I mean those things are sitting in a warehouse already bought.
**Cheryl.green**: So you're, you're not going to save 100 of that material cost.
**Bschwartz**: Yeah.
**Bschwartz**: So that, that's a question for you guys on the lead Eliado side.
**Bschwartz**: What's, there's going to be some savings there, but what's going to be the fee, the return fee on those to the manufacturer?
**Cheryl.green**: Yeah, just rough.
**Cheryl.green**: Are we talking off top my head, I'm not sure if we can get more than 30% back on those because of their, their specialty.
**Bschwartz**: Okay.
**Bschwartz**: But I guess 30% back is still 30% back.
**Bschwartz**: So it's going to be a savings.
**Cheryl.green**: It's a net savings.
**Cheryl.green**: It's just, it's just not a, Joe had mentioned 50%.
**Cheryl.green**: Like that's not the case.
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay, well let's definitely get that, get that confirmed, Brandon.
**Aelkarrimy**: But what if we're returning four transformers?
**Bschwartz**: Yeah.
**Aelkarrimy**: I mean just upsizing.
**Aelkarrimy**: They wouldn't, they wouldn't kind of.
**Cheryl.green**: They have re.
**Cheryl.green**: Yeah, no, because this a the specialty and they, they have re what's called restocking fees.
**Cheryl.green**: You know, I, I, I agree with you, it's stupid.
**Cheryl.green**: But it's just, it's what the, the supply houses do.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, no, we deal with restocking fees all the time, but losing 70% is, that's just, that's crazy.
**Cheryl.green**: Yeah.
**Cheryl.green**: I mean if it's not a, if it was a standard, you know, 400amp panel, right.
**Cheryl.green**: That, that they, they ship 100 of them a day, it'd be one thing.
**Cheryl.green**: But these transformers are specialized.
**Cheryl.green**: This is not a common thing.
**Aelkarrimy**: Brandon, do you mind just confirming the percentage that we're losing?
**Cheryl.green**: Yeah, we'll, we'll, we'll confirm that.
**Aelkarrimy**: And I know you have relationships.
**Aelkarrimy**: If you can, if you can see if they can look us out here, it would be great.
**Aelkarrimy**: But 30 is a little, a little crazy.
**Cheryl.green**: Yeah, I mean the only thing I could say to do and you know, I can talk to Joe and stuff on you know, offline is, you know, if we can look at, you know, other exotics coming up in the country, you know, then we may be able to repurpose.
**Cheryl.green**: Repurpose these, you know, like, you know me as a leader, I'll just put them in our warehouse or something.
**Cheryl.green**: Like we've done that before.
**Cheryl.green**: But I, you know, that's no guarantee.
**Cheryl.green**: That's a, that's a big luck thing.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: How much, how much work is it going to be like when we're taking these transformers out, you're just taking a straight 480 volt line there.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Like what do you have to change to allow that to happen?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Are you talking a bunch of work on your side?
**Mparsons**: I think you save, I think the savings, Jesse, would be instead of the electrician terminating the feeders in the transformer, installing the transformer, getting it set and terminating in the transformer, these feeders would just terminate in the power boxes from Exotek instead.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: But is exotect.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Do they have to make a special power box now or it's no cost to change that feature when they ship this to you?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Because I, I don't, for me, I don't understand.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I would just take a transformer out and the same equipment works or you're changing out.
**Daisuke.mine**: Yeah, so, so we would either some of, some of our third party machinery that we're working with, they have an option where we can transform it down that way.
**Daisuke.mine**: So they might transform it down for us in other cases.
**Daisuke.mine**: We've already kind of, our power boxes are already going to be custom so we just might customize it a little bit more to kind of add a smaller transformer on our end for the more specific needs.
**Daisuke.mine**: But it's going to be some combination of working with our other suppliers and then just adding to our power box that way.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, basically what's happened is we're, we, we are hiring our own electricians because from, you know, from Uniqlo's side they just say here's your power drop and then we handle it from there.
**Bryan.wagar**: I mean what, what we're looking at is instead of putting in one of these bigger transmission transformers, it's can we run some of the equipment on 480 and then have a smaller step down and have art and, and honestly that's kind of where us as exotech is trying to get creative and also absorb, you know, as much of this cost as we can and say hey, we'll have our electricians install their own that down to all the other equipment or possibly negotiate with the, with our third party equipment people and say hey can you.
**Bryan.wagar**: Because does the machine have the functionality to.
**Bryan.wagar**: As an option to step down itself.
**Bryan.wagar**: So you know we are looking into everything, you know, as far as.
**Bryan.wagar**: As much as we could possibly do and you know, take from our side.
**Bryan.wagar**: So with, with this.
**Bryan.wagar**: But with this what Cody just presented how much.
**Bryan.wagar**: No, no, I'm not saying how much in terms of money.
**Bryan.wagar**: We'll figure that out later.
**Bryan.wagar**: But how, how much does this change as far as how many new transformers need to be ordered with.
**Bryan.wagar**: If we did this with the 480 and the four spots.
**Bschwartz**: It would.
**Mparsons**: If we're talking strictly quantity of transformers, it's a four.
**Mparsons**: It's a quantity of four.
**Mparsons**: A reduction in four transformers.
**Mparsons**: So we would have instead of eight transform transformers for one for each of the drops we would be down to four transformers for the.
**Bschwartz**: The Sky Pods and we would pull.
**Mparsons**: A directly a 480 volt feed to the sky path.
**Mparsons**: Conveyor control panels, power power boxes.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And does this, does this eliminate.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I think like one of the transformers for the new layout was like a hundred and the Others were like 40 and a 75.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Now there's like a 110.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Would it get rid of that?
**Mparsons**: Yeah, the one 12 and a half would go away.
**Bschwartz**: The.
**Mparsons**: Let me look at that PDF from Exit Tech again quick.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, I'm just kind of asking.
**Bryan.wagar**: Is there new transformers that need to be ordered with this new.
**Mparsons**: No.
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay.
**Bschwartz**: No, we should.
**Bschwartz**: The.
**Mparsons**: The 75s are what you have on in stock already, right Jesse?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: We have four though.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Four 75s and four 4045 45s.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Bschwartz**: So yeah, the.
**Mparsons**: I mean honestly we could, we could talk about as a sidebar whether we use 75s for all four of the sky Pods or if we try to fit two of the sky pod drops on some of the 45s which would allow us to return two 75s in and two 45s instead of just returning 45s.
**Mparsons**: I don't know if that's what the costs associated with that would be, but essentially yeah, we would no longer need the new 112 and a half KVA size transformers with this option, which would save us from ordering any new transformers at all.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: But we could potentially so and was looking at it like to compare these costs.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So by doing this then you would only need two 45s and two with the direct 480 volt feeds.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: What was it?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: 275s and 245s is all you would need.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So we'd be returning 245s and 275s.
**Mparsons**: You're talking the 480 volt.
**Mparsons**: Excuse me, the 400 volt step downs.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Instead of the step downs, I was trying to try to figure out on our end how we.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: We make this like we're returning this many.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: We're not ordering this one.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So.
**Mparsons**: So the drops that still require transformers, there's two that are shown at 41.9 KVA and there are two that show that are shown at 61.9 KVA.
**Mparsons**: So for sure, the 61.9s are going to need 75 KVA transformers.
**Mparsons**: The 41.9s are fairly tight on a 45 KVA transformer, but should theoretically still work on a 45 KVA transformer.
**Mparsons**: My only concern, there would be any potential inrush from exitec system on startup that could exceed the 45 KVA rating of those transformers.
**Bschwartz**: But depending on the length of that.
**Mparsons**: Inrush, we would probably still be fine.
**Bschwartz**: Too, because those transformers should be rated.
**Mparsons**: To handle a certain amount of inrush over the rating of the transformer itself.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And none of the wiring would change.
**Aelkarrimy**: I'm sorry, Jesse.
**Bryan.wagar**: Go ahead.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Well, I'm sorry, I was going to say.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And then none of the wiring that we've already ordered would change in this.
**Bschwartz**: I think we.
**Bschwartz**: I think we would have a change.
**Mparsons**: But we'd have a.
**Bschwartz**: If we go with 45kvas on two.
**Mparsons**: Of those Skypod transformers, we would be a reduction from the 75 KVA wiring to 45 KVA wiring.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: But if they've already got the wire, they would just use the larger wire and be fine.
**Mparsons**: Which should be fine because it'll help help with voltage drop anyway.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: A.
**Mparsons**: A1 and B1, are those at the front or at the back?
**Bschwartz**: Those are at the front.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Right.
**Daisuke.mine**: I think the A1s were in the drawing on the bottom.
**Bschwartz**: Okay.
**Bschwartz**: So that.
**Mparsons**: That would actually be good, Jesse, because you'll.
**Mparsons**: If you use a large.
**Mparsons**: If you continue to use the larger wire for the smaller transformers, you'll help with voltage drop on those longer runs.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yep.
**Mparsons**: Sorry, I'm still trying to answer the.
**Mparsons**: Cody, your question on how much.
**Mparsons**: How much wires is already included for the skypath.
**Daisuke.mine**: Yeah.
**Daisuke.mine**: How much kvas the wire can handle.
**Mparsons**: I'm looking for one more schedule on my end to confirm that for you real quick.
**Daisuke.mine**: Yeah, you're.
**Daisuke.mine**: You're good.
**Daisuke.mine**: And if you can't get it in this call, you can just send an email and that'll Work whenever you do find it, that is.
**Mparsons**: I found it.
**Mparsons**: Sorry.
**Mparsons**: It was.
**Daisuke.mine**: Oh, you're good.
**Mparsons**: I got.
**Mparsons**: I gotta go to a weird folder in our location.
**Mparsons**: So.
**Mparsons**: Okay, so for those.
**Mparsons**: The original design for the skypath.
**Mparsons**: So what was included in the altitude permit set.
**Mparsons**: What Aliato has bid was 45 KVA transformers for each of the Skypath conveyor drops.
**Mparsons**: Those are all fed with 90amps worth of wire, which gets you about 75 just short of 75 KVA worth of power.
**Daisuke.mine**: And that's for the Skypod.
**Mparsons**: That's.
**Bschwartz**: That's.
**Bschwartz**: No, that's for the SkyPath.
**Daisuke.mine**: Okay.
**Daisuke.mine**: So the SkyPath can currently handle.
**Daisuke.mine**: The SkyPath cables can currently handle 75 KVA.
**Mparsons**: Just short of 75 KVA.
**Mparsons**: I'd say 70 KVA to call it.
**Mparsons**: To play it safe.
**Kevin.ly**: Okay.
**Daisuke.mine**: And if we.
**Daisuke.mine**: So if we kept it as is, I think when we talked last, our values for those were higher than that already.
**Bschwartz**: Yep.
**Mparsons**: So your, your CSO2 is at 47.49 KVA.
**Mparsons**: So that's, that's the only one that would be able to remain at that wire size.
**Mparsons**: The other ones were 79.94 and 85.06.
**Mparsons**: So if those didn't even increase from there, we're.
**Mparsons**: We're still talking about increasing wire size.
**Bschwartz**: And in conjunction with that, that would.
**Mparsons**: Change our breaker size in the.
**Mparsons**: The HE1 panel as well.
**Daisuke.mine**: Does the breaker change regardless of if it's going to a transformer or not, or would that not be needed if we did keep a transformer?
**Cheryl.green**: Just curious.
**Mparsons**: It's going to change regardless of whether we use a transformer or not, if the KVA is going up.
**Daisuke.mine**: Okay, I think that answers my question then.
**Daisuke.mine**: Like I kind of led with.
**Daisuke.mine**: I'm still looking into it, so I'm going to need some time to kind of just keep looking and stuff.
**Daisuke.mine**: But I think for the time being, think.
**Daisuke.mine**: Thank you for all the answers.
**Bschwartz**: So sorry.
**Mparsons**: Before, before we, before we wrap this discussion up.
**Mparsons**: Jesse, Jesse and.
**Mparsons**: And Keba, I think you guys have our one line diagram already.
**Mparsons**: But for.
**Bschwartz**: If we're still.
**Bschwartz**: If you guys want to look at.
**Mparsons**: Pricing on that, we would remove the transformer, but we'd still have.
**Bschwartz**: I'm assuming we.
**Mparsons**: If it's not a large.
**Mparsons**: A huge increase in KVA on those drops, we'd stop.
**Mparsons**: Still probably go with the 175amp wire.
**Mparsons**: 175amp breakers for those three drops.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I'm going to open that drawing up and just make a few markups on that.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I'll share the screen.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Share it to our screens here.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Kevin, you got this saved in the folder.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Is it the Addenda 529 set?
**Cheryl.green**: You're muted, Keva.
**Kevin.ly**: I'm sorry.
**Kevin.ly**: Yes, that's the one.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: All right, let me just get to it.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: These are all architectural plans here, Keva.
**Bschwartz**: I was going to say we set the latest and greatest markups of those on 610.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Is that.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: How did you share those?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Was it email?
**Bschwartz**: Yeah, it was the email.
**Mparsons**: I might have sent that on 6 11.
**Mparsons**: It might have been 610.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Here we go.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Transformer info.
**Kevin.ly**: I've emailed it to you, Jesse, if you don't find it.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: There it is.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I got it.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: There we go.
**Bschwartz**: Okay, so we had.
**Bschwartz**: I want.
**Bschwartz**: I think it's TLE2.
**Bschwartz**: TLE5 and TLE8 are the three for the conveyors that were feeding 112 and a half KVA transformers.
**Bschwartz**: So those are shown as feeders 173s.
**Bschwartz**: It's 175amp feeder.
**Bschwartz**: Be 175amp circuit breaker in HE1 that would be replaced.
**Bschwartz**: Let me just.
**Mparsons**: Let me just run a quick calc too.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Le2 over the other ones.
**Bschwartz**: Le5 and Le8.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And so you're saying those need to go from 175 breaker to a larger breaker.
**Bschwartz**: No, sorry.
**Bschwartz**: Those would stay as a 175.
**Bschwartz**: I'm saying those transformers would.
**Bschwartz**: If we were.
**Mparsons**: Even if we remove those transformers.
**Bschwartz**: Sorry, let me rephrase that.
**Bschwartz**: If we remove those transformers we would.
**Bschwartz**: We would go from a.
**Bschwartz**: We would remain with a 175amp breaker and a 175amp feeder.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Bschwartz**: Which would be.
**Bschwartz**: Which would be an increase from the original 90amp.
**Mparsons**: From a cost perspective.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I see.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So these.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Currently we got 90amps and we need to get 175 transformers are now.
**Bschwartz**: Yeah.
**Bschwartz**: With.
**Bschwartz**: With the new solution that Cody and Joe are proposing.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: All right.
**Bschwartz**: And actually, sorry, I just ran the calc.
**Bschwartz**: We could probably get away with a smaller.
**Bschwartz**: A slightly smaller feeder and.
**Bschwartz**: And breaker if we went straight 480 volt.
**Bschwartz**: Those, those 112 and a half KVAs are, are what's pushing us into a slightly higher feeder because that's the next standard size of transformer.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Bschwartz**: So Cody, Cody, once you.
**Bschwartz**: Once you've run that, that information down on what the increase in the KVA would be, if we go to 480 volt, if you can share that and we can run final numbers.
**Bschwartz**: But we're.
**Bschwartz**: We're pretty close to 125amp breaker 125amp feed.
**Bschwartz**: If we went 40 volt instead of 400 volt.
**Daisuke.mine**: Yeah, I, I can take a look into it.
**Daisuke.mine**: I am going to be out of office for the next two days, so I might not be able to get to this until Monday, but I will get that to you as soon as I possibly can.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And then we were talking about the ones that would stay.
**Bschwartz**: The ones that would stay would be Le3 and Le4 and I believe it's Le6 and Le7.
**Mparsons**: Let me go back to that permit set because I'm.
**Bschwartz**: Yeah, LE3, LE4, LE6, LE7 are the ones that were designated for the SkyPods and I think we've already, we've already changed Those over to 45 KVA on this one line in conjunction with the reduced loads of those.
**Bschwartz**: So.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: This says 3 and 4 or 75.
**Bschwartz**: Yeah, 6 and 7 would be the ones that dropped to 45 KVAs from.
**Mparsons**: Our original out to permit set.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: They were 75s before.
**Bschwartz**: Yep.
**Bschwartz**: And we can, once we issue this bulletin one, we can switch those 70amp feeders to those two back to whatever we had as the original feeder size, if that's what you guys are planning to do.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: That's what I'm saying.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: They pre ordered these, this conduit and wire, you know, so if bigger doesn't matter, it'd be cheaper to put the bigger wire in then order new.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Smaller, obviously.
**Bschwartz**: Yeah.
**Bschwartz**: And bigger.
**Bschwartz**: Bigger wire, like I said, is never too big of an issue.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yep.
**Bschwartz**: It's almost better on when you're getting into these large warehouses, so.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: All right, we'll get with Tim.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Tim's back tomorrow, isn't he, Kevin?
**Cheryl.green**: Okay, guys, just keep in mind, you know, the like whatever it is that we change or don't change, but you know, if we do change, you know, the longer it takes then the more susceptible we are to some sort of schedule impact.
**Cheryl.green**: Not saying we're at that point yet, but time is of the essence.
**Cheryl.green**: So I just want to make sure we're aware.
**Bryan.wagar**: No, completely.
**Bryan.wagar**: We're definitely keeping that in our minds for sure.
**Aelkarrimy**: And then Joe and Cody is the ask now of Aliato to price once we figure out the KVA and confirm it for this option.
**Aelkarrimy**: Is the goal to price out this option versus what we discussed last week, upsizing the transformers?
**Aelkarrimy**: So then we could do a comparison.
**Bryan.wagar**: Right, Right now the ask is to price it out as we talked about last week, what it's going to cost to do it with, stepping down everything with the, with the bigger Transformers and that and then we will we again, I don't want to, I don't want anybody to do more work than they have to.
**Bryan.wagar**: We're still researching if this is a possibility on our end.
**Bryan.wagar**: It's not guaranteed yet.
**Bryan.wagar**: This is just a kind of a half baked idea at this moment.
**Bryan.wagar**: So we are still looking and working with other teams here at Exotech to make sure that this indeed will, will work.
**Bryan.wagar**: And then we could talk about.
**Bryan.wagar**: That's why I'm saying don't order anything new, you know, until one, you know, we figure out the solution.
**Bryan.wagar**: You know, regardless, we're not going to have an answer until just before July 4th.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: All right.
**Bryan.wagar**: But, but we definitely, we definitely don't want to double up on ordering equipment that we might not need again.
**Bryan.wagar**: So.
**Bryan.wagar**: But we do want to keep these discussions going Wednesday, definitely for next month as well.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Understood.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: We'll get back to you as soon as we can with that pricing.
**Bryan.wagar**: So appreciate it, guys.
**Bschwartz**: And appreciate everyone bearing with me while I engineer on the fly here.
**Aelkarrimy**: Ideas, Brian, best ideas are always on the fly.
**Bschwartz**: You're just lucky that I'm a sparky and I can do this on a call like this and not have to.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah, I'm very, very, very, very, very, very shocked what you did.
**Aelkarrimy**: And I was, I was speaking to Ben on the side and I was like, this is a great, interesting conversation.
**Aelkarrimy**: We're learning something new here.
**Cheryl.green**: Chat.
**Cheryl.green**: GBT works wonders, doesn't it?
**Aelkarrimy**: Oh, 100%.
**Bschwartz**: This, this was all straight from my brain.
**Bschwartz**: I don't know what you're talking about.
**Bschwartz**: I'm not using, I'm not using AI over here.
**Bschwartz**: I'm using the engineering knowledge I've learned over the last 10 years.
**Cheryl.green**: He uses BI, not AI.
**Cheryl.green**: Awesome.
**Cheryl.green**: Well, appreciate it.
**Cheryl.green**: We'll keep working on our end and just let us know what you guys figure out engineering wise and we'll figure out a way to get them up and running in time.
**Bryan.wagar**: Perfect.
**Bryan.wagar**: Perfect.
**Bryan.wagar**: Appreciate it, guys.
**Bryan.wagar**: Thanks, everyone.
**Bryan.wagar**: I'll talk to you in just a moment.
**Bryan.wagar**: I'll.
**Bryan.wagar**: I'll join the meeting that you sent out.
**Cheryl.green**: Thanks, guys.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: All right, thanks.
**Bschwartz**: Thanks, everyone.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Thank you.
**Kevin.ly**: Thanks.
**Jdawson**: Take care.
