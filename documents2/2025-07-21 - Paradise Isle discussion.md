## Transcript
**Bclymer**: We were on a zoom call.
**Bclymer**: She's like, is that a cat?
**Bclymer**: And she's opening a dog park, so.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Gmarquez**: Jesse.
**Gmarquez**: Good morning, sir.
**Bclymer**: Morning, Danny.
**Bclymer**: How we doing?
**Jdawson**: This meeting is being recorded.
**Gmarquez**: Kurt, can you hear me?
**Jremillard**: Hear me finally.
**Jremillard**: Sorry.
**Jremillard**: The speaker.
**Jremillard**: I had to plug it in from last week.
**Jremillard**: Can you hear me?
**Gmarquez**: Yep, I can hear you.
**Gmarquez**: Perfect.
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Gmarquez**: Brandon and Jesse, I know in the past this is my opportunity to get you guys introduced to Kurt.
**Gmarquez**: So Kurt is one of the partners for the firm.
**Gmarquez**: Jesse and Brandon and I were.
**Gmarquez**: Jesse and I worked together on the Serena townhomes, and Jesse worked for Valor at one point.
**Gmarquez**: Jesse's now with Brandon, and they're the ones that send over the paradise aisle documents and everything else.
**Gmarquez**: So just, you know, finally got to make an introduction for the both of you.
**Gmarquez**: I'm sorry, I didn't.
**Gmarquez**: I'm not turning my camera on because I'm, I'm home today and I'm, I'm a mess, and I don't.
**Jdawson**: Honestly, that's for everybody.
**Jremillard**: Way to start off the conversation, Danny.
**Jremillard**: That's, that's.
**Jdawson**: I, I, I had a big breakfast, so I don't want to get sick.
**Jdawson**: Anyway.
**Gmarquez**: There you go.
**Jremillard**: Thank you both for understanding my fine principal that runs Tampa, apparently from his house in his pajamas.
**Jremillard**: The pack looks amazing, guys.
**Jremillard**: It's super big project, super ambitious, Definitely something we'd love to be part of.
**Jremillard**: Just, just kind of wanted to talk about a little bit and understand what your vision is.
**Jremillard**: I understand if there's a, a phasing component of it and kind of where you are with entitlements and all that, that good, good stuff that, you know, gets in the way of actually building something.
**Jdawson**: So entitlements, we've got all of them that we need.
**Jdawson**: You know, we're pretty much locked in to the island as it sits and everything, just simply because we've got a, we've got it entitled that way.
**Jdawson**: We, we kind of up against the clock here.
**Jdawson**: Now.
**Jdawson**: There is, you know, we, we've, we've done some design, just some, some other changes.
**Jdawson**: We know that we want to change.
**Jdawson**: Like, for instance, like getting rid of the dry boat storage, you know, adjust some things on, on the island.
**Jdawson**: But the, the actual squares that we're working in, the, you know, the sandbox can't change.
**Jdawson**: But we, we do want to change that.
**Jdawson**: So the, the way that we're looking at it right now is it's, it's not going to be a phased approach.
**Jdawson**: We're going to hit the ground running, you know, I mean the phases are going to be as it's one big project.
**Jdawson**: So obviously we're going to do mass earthwork and everything like that.
**Jdawson**: And then if you, if you're looking at the drawing that we sent you, let's say plan southwest, which is where all those like townhomes and stuff along the course will be.
**Jdawson**: That would be the first tranche of structures that go up just because it's going to be the quickest.
**Gmarquez**: Share.
**Gmarquez**: Yeah.
**Gmarquez**: Just for visual aid.
**Gmarquez**: Sorry.
**Gmarquez**: Can everybody see my screen?
**Jremillard**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: So yeah, that, that south plan southwest side.
**Jdawson**: So you see where it says 11 BD to the left.
**Jdawson**: Your other left.
**Gmarquez**: I left like all the way left.
**Jdawson**: All the way left.
**Gmarquez**: Oh, here we go.
**Gmarquez**: Here we go.
**Gmarquez**: Here we go.
**Gmarquez**: Sorry.
**Jdawson**: Yep, keep going.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: So see that, that tranche of stuff there, that road and then there's even more to the left.
**Jdawson**: All that stuff would be the first stuff built.
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: You know, because we've got to create everything else on the lagoon and island and whatnot.
**Jremillard**: So, so is the, is the island actually, I guess in some of the stuff I was reading through with the, the text that came with this is the island, you're kind of building that out as almost a man made island.
**Jdawson**: Is that there is no island right now.
**Jdawson**: It's going to be a man made island.
**Jremillard**: Okay, got it.
**Jremillard**: So.
**Gmarquez**: So just to be clear.
**Gmarquez**: Right.
**Gmarquez**: Just, just so I understand this correctly, all the civil approvals and everything for the island, everything from what Jesse told me that's been approved, all the civil work for all the rezoning and, and everything else that's been approved in addition to the entitlement for what the package that we have, that's pretty much.
**Gmarquez**: That's what was approved as the air quotes entitlement component.
**Gmarquez**: Correct?
**Jdawson**: Correct.
**Gmarquez**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: So I guess the idea would be you'd build and there's design work done on.
**Jremillard**: You know, I saw that in the pack.
**Jremillard**: There was some design work like basic elevations and things done of a ball kind of the, the structures that you're looking for.
**Jremillard**: But that is going to get refined.
**Jremillard**: Or is that kind of as far as a design architect's going to take it?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So the, the, the civil designer that we have on this is going to remain the same.
**Jdawson**: Probably the same with the golf course designer.
**Jdawson**: And then everything else is, is what we're looking at adjusting.
**Jdawson**: So the.
**Jdawson**: Again, we're gonna, we've got a different layout.
**Jdawson**: I don't know if Jesse sent it to you of kind of what we're thinking for the island.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Because we want to again get rid of that 200 drive dry boat storage, adjust it, you know, to where we're.
**Jdawson**: We're not.
**Jdawson**: Not the wet one, the dry one.
**Jremillard**: Down to the, down to the right damage.
**Gmarquez**: Oh, sorry.
**Jremillard**: This boats.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, yep.
**Jdawson**: And just rearrange some stuff on the island to where it's like cash flowing more essentially.
**Jdawson**: I mean the, I think putting a.
**Jdawson**: We all agree that putting a 200 boat ute dry storage on an island like that is a waste of money.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jremillard**: So yeah, the island, the island lays out nicely for a real like, like destination entertainment, you know, a river walk or walk, lagoon walk type of, you know, venue.
**Jremillard**: So yeah, the boat storage probably could go someplace else.
**Jremillard**: That makes sense.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I mean we're probably just going to do away with it all together because we also don't want to attract that clientele that's going to do that.
**Jdawson**: So we're just going to get rid of it and sell the slips.
**Jremillard**: Got it.
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Gmarquez**: Okay.
**Gmarquez**: Makes sense.
**Bclymer**: And just the, you know, I think Danny, we talked a little bit.
**Bclymer**: There's the emergency airport.
**Bclymer**: If anything gets diverted from the Fort Myers airport goes over this in some manner so that the heights of all the buildings on the island around that are kind of set their max out.
**Gmarquez**: That's what I think from the document is everything on the aisle is like limited to 75ft.
**Jremillard**: But the condos, the 9B and 9A or taller.
**Gmarquez**: Yeah.
**Gmarquez**: So those are still those.
**Gmarquez**: The, the understanding is that those would still be 20 stories, these two would still be 12 stories and everything else would be the three story mix.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Gmarquez**: Okay.
**Gmarquez**: The one thing that Jesse and I talked about and the one thing that Kurt and I were talking about was just the sequencing of the structures themselves.
**Gmarquez**: Right.
**Gmarquez**: So the, the way that.
**Gmarquez**: Are you anticipating going in with this as one massive permit with all these things, is it going to be like a PDE where you're just doing like one massive development?
**Gmarquez**: Something in the vein that, that was done at like, like we've done it with the other larger scale master plan.
**Gmarquez**: Because I think, you know, one of the things that we were just talking out was, you know, what would be the process and the sequencing of being able to put the structures through the building department.
**Gmarquez**: Right.
**Gmarquez**: Or, or a private provider, however you want to structure it.
**Gmarquez**: But what were your thoughts on that?
**Jdawson**: So time is going to prevent us from doing one big massive permit.
**Jdawson**: So this is, this is going to be a, a pure design build play.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: So the first thing is getting it in to start our mass earthwork because we know it's going to take, you know, a year at least before we start putting up any kind of structures.
**Jdawson**: And so the first one is just going to be a land improvement permit getting everything moved.
**Jdawson**: And then as we refine what we're going to do, structure wise, then we're going to go in, you know, to the city with that.
**Bclymer**: And I gave you a schedule, Danny, Kind of.
**Gmarquez**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: You know, we can't build everything all at once either, so we got to have a little bit of lag in between.
**Gmarquez**: It's.
**Gmarquez**: It.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, that makes sense.
**Gmarquez**: Right.
**Gmarquez**: Well, the reason that I bring it up was just, you know, I guess my assumption would be is that we're gonna, you know, there's going to be approximately 11.
**Gmarquez**: 11 separate structures and.
**Gmarquez**: Or permits in one form or another for each building type.
**Gmarquez**: And, you know, just trying to think of the sequencing of.
**Gmarquez**: Of finishing the design of the physical portions or pieces.
**Jremillard**: Right.
**Gmarquez**: Structures, and then submitting them in to go in through the process of the review and everything else for approval.
**Gmarquez**: Because as much as I would like to sit there and say, like, the building department's gonna be right on with that schedule as well, I'm just curious to see if you guys had thought about that component of it, because that is the.
**Gmarquez**: It has its own ebbs and flows with regards to review and speed and going through that process.
**Jremillard**: To get.
**Jdawson**: The only thing we can do is.
**Jdawson**: The only thing we can do is plug a reasonable time frame, which I believe we have in there, and adjust accordingly because we can't control.
**Jdawson**: You know, if there's some city gets a wild hair up their ass and they just want to try to delay it.
**Gmarquez**: Right.
**Jremillard**: From a sequencing.
**Jremillard**: From a sequencing point of view, we're looking at, like, the townhomes and the 11.
**Jremillard**: The 11 mil.
**Jremillard**: The buildings labeled 11 would go first.
**Bclymer**: They're actually.
**Bclymer**: That's why they call them townhomes.
**Bclymer**: I'm not sure.
**Jdawson**: But their apartments right now, more than likely we will adjust them to be townhomes.
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: And then you build your way to the island or, like, what would come next.
**Bclymer**: We would go.
**Bclymer**: Let me share my screen.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, Walk you through that.
**Jremillard**: Because that'll help us with the proposal.
**Jremillard**: Just trying to figure out what.
**Jremillard**: What sequence they go.
**Jremillard**: And so we'll be.
**Jremillard**: We're going to have to be ahead of.
**Jremillard**: Obviously ahead of that and ahead of that by enough that you guys can review it, check it with, you know, the GC in terms of budgets and everything, and then you get the permits.
**Jremillard**: Oh, this works.
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So you know, we'll start these 11, all the 11 buildings, apartments, future townhomes.
**Bclymer**: We'll start building them because really the.
**Bclymer**: We're not having to do much grading.
**Bclymer**: It's kind of wide open.
**Bclymer**: We can use the, you know, we're going to also set up in the beginning all of our logistics for the parking trailers lay down all of that will go around here.
**Bclymer**: And as we're building these first buildings, we'll also start on the work it takes to build this island and this new marina.
**Bclymer**: Putting in the seawall, getting the island built so that, you know, that eight month or so later after we get that done, we'll start kind of on this side and working our way out.
**Bclymer**: And I just used, you know, this 428 date is when we would like to have most something where like the hotel's ready to open at that point, you know, we've got these here condo timeshare buildings as well done.
**Bclymer**: There's three of those buildings in the parking garage.
**Bclymer**: So we'd be kind of starting with this building, move to this, start with 4, move to 3, then to 1.
**Bclymer**: Hotel would start around.
**Bclymer**: You know, we'd want to start that early on too because it's got the longer build time.
**Bclymer**: And then this parking garage shouldn't take nearly as long.
**Bclymer**: So we're going to kind of start it later on.
**Bclymer**: We man white box and this the golf clubhouse.
**Bclymer**: Just because we don't want to be doing structure on the island when everything else opens up.
**Bclymer**: But it's.
**Bclymer**: The golf course isn't going to open until I think 29 is our figure.
**Bclymer**: So having that just abandoned, you know, sit there empty for a year doesn't make sense either.
**Bclymer**: But having the building up is our plan.
**Bclymer**: So that's kind of it is getting this end of the island done as we're doing that, finishing up this bridge over here, working on the marina.
**Bclymer**: But these buildings kind of.
**Bclymer**: That's the schedule I sent you, Danny.
**Bclymer**: Like numbers and kind of the, the start time of them, which is this here.
**Bclymer**: So these 11, those buildings, first we build our island and then we start with building four, building seven A and B, then one, three, six, the parking garage.
**Bclymer**: And you know, after we get this island built, you know, we'll have started, you know, soon after on these big condos.
**Bclymer**: And then the plan is to move over to the 10 condos so that we're using this as our, you know, as we demobilize all of our logistics from the golf course so that we can get working on it in 28.
**Bclymer**: And then it would move to a much a smaller footprint since we're only building, you know, these two buildings and these two buildings.
**Bclymer**: And then the last thing we would do is these townhomes that make up that section coming into the job site.
**Bclymer**: Once we got these two buildings done that last year, is what we would like to finish up with them.
**Gmarquez**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: So from a.
**Jremillard**: Okay, so that makes it from a proposal point of view, how would you like us to break this out per building for chunks of buildings?
**Jremillard**: How does that.
**Jremillard**: How would it make sense for you guys to see it?
**Bclymer**: Well, if you want to do it like this schedule would really like if you had it broke out by these areas, you know, the 11 buildings are kind of two separate things.
**Jdawson**: I mean, that's how we have our construction numbers broken out.
**Jremillard**: Does that make sense for you if I do the proposals kind of based off of that?
**Jremillard**: Right, right.
**Jdawson**: And then we have a design wrapped into each one.
**Jdawson**: Each building makes sense.
**Jremillard**: And then from a consultant point of view, do you guys have MEP structure guys you're thinking of using, or should I kind of bring those along with us?
**Bclymer**: We have structure.
**Bclymer**: I've worked with B and W for years.
**Bclymer**: I would like them to do the structural.
**Bclymer**: We don't have neps, so those you could bring along.
**Bclymer**: You know, thinking about these when you, you know, we're not going to have a whole lot of time on these.
**Bclymer**: So I would like the coordination to be over and above standard for sure on, you know, the, the BIM modeling and the coordination.
**Bclymer**: And on that end, just so we don't run into a bunch of issues that we have to figure out during construction.
**Gmarquez**: Right.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, understood.
**Jremillard**: Makes sense.
**Gmarquez**: What is the timeline?
**Gmarquez**: Because.
**Gmarquez**: So I'm assuming there's a running clock, right?
**Gmarquez**: What.
**Gmarquez**: What is that timeline?
**Gmarquez**: Can you guys just kind of elaborate?
**Jremillard**: It's right.
**Jremillard**: It's right here.
**Jremillard**: Danny, they want to start phase one eleven.
**Gmarquez**: They see any.
**Jremillard**: They want to start the.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, they want to start building it Monday, 15 of next year.
**Gmarquez**: Oh, so we have to.
**Gmarquez**: Got it.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: They working like we're told.
**Bclymer**: We can permit this tomorrow.
**Bclymer**: We could submit the plans we have currently to get a permit, at least a, you know, a site permit, you know, start moving dirt.
**Bclymer**: So that's why it's just a matter of when we close and when that happens, we'd like to start first of the year.
**Jremillard**: Okay, so just.
**Jremillard**: Just getting back to.
**Jremillard**: I guess Danny mentioned GVI was involved in the design.
**Jremillard**: Are they staying involved?
**Jremillard**: How does design process look?
**Bclymer**: Just talking to Albro, I'd Like, I like the way they design things.
**Bclymer**: And I think, you know, we think, you know, we want this to be like a.
**Bclymer**: It's a destination.
**Bclymer**: It's almost like stay in the US and go to some Caribbean island and, you know, just having that whole feel and look and, you know, we got our own island, which is rare.
**Bclymer**: That you can.
**Jremillard**: Pretty cool.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, that.
**Bclymer**: So we want, you know, I'd like them to do the design, the concepts, and, you know, you guys are doing everything what it takes to build them and get them.
**Jdawson**: So do you do.
**Jremillard**: From a.
**Jremillard**: Do you think the handover is, you know, at dd?
**Jremillard**: You know, where would they.
**Jremillard**: They get a concept together?
**Jremillard**: You know, exterior elevations renderings and some, you know, the unit floor plans and things like that.
**Jremillard**: They.
**Jremillard**: You guys approve that, then they hand it over to us.
**Jremillard**: Is that like beginning of dd?
**Jremillard**: Mid dd.
**Jremillard**: How does.
**Jremillard**: How.
**Jremillard**: Where would you like us to start?
**Jremillard**: I guess they've got a concept that you guys like.
**Gmarquez**: I was thinking.
**Gmarquez**: I don't know, Jesse.
**Gmarquez**: Like, the way that we've done it in the past is like Alvaro usually likes taking it to 100 SD and then usually doing that.
**Gmarquez**: A clean handoff after that.
**Gmarquez**: And that's what I would have anticipated unless he.
**Gmarquez**: He'd want to do just concept and then we'd have to help with the schematic.
**Gmarquez**: But that's what.
**Gmarquez**: What I was thinking.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I agree.
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: Hand off it just.
**Bclymer**: You guys would be working.
**Gmarquez**: You know, we would be hand in hand for the concept and the schematic, but they would put the design together, the layouts, the intent, all that fun stuff.
**Gmarquez**: We would help with the life safety, help with all the fire code stuff, all the.
**Gmarquez**: All the Florida ancillary items.
**Gmarquez**: And then we would just take full control for the rest of the design development with the trades and everybody else, and then just finish the construction documents and ca.
**Bclymer**: Correct.
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: And that'll just be lockstep through that, through this whole list of phases here.
**Jremillard**: Right.
**Jremillard**: We've got.
**Gmarquez**: Well, if I could make a suggestion.
**Gmarquez**: Jesse, do you mind going back to that.
**Gmarquez**: That.
**Gmarquez**: The markup.
**Gmarquez**: The layout.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Gmarquez**: Like, would it make sense for you guys for.
**Gmarquez**: For everybody where.
**Gmarquez**: Where it's broken down into two phases.
**Gmarquez**: Let me see if I can work this up.
**Gmarquez**: Meaning that everything that's outside of the island would be like one phase, and then this all is.
**Gmarquez**: Is another.
**Gmarquez**: And then that way just.
**Gmarquez**: You have a break just in scope, or would you rather just have it done by building?
**Bclymer**: The thing we're trying to do is work our way out of it and still get done in the five year time period.
**Gmarquez**: Right.
**Gmarquez**: You'd have to follow by the dates more than anything.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: We'd have to be ahead of them from a design point of view.
**Gmarquez**: At least six months.
**Jremillard**: I don't know.
**Jremillard**: I was going to say.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, at least half a year.
**Jremillard**: So that, that we leave a little bit of time to permit it a little bit of time for the GCs to look at it and you know, any ve that needs to get done or you know, whatever.
**Jremillard**: But I can put together.
**Jremillard**: Or Danny and I can put together proposals for.
**Jremillard**: That's kind of based on all of the little like, like, like building types.
**Jremillard**: Right.
**Jremillard**: So you have.
**Jremillard**: I give you a proposal each building type or I can group them together.
**Jremillard**: Whichever.
**Jremillard**: Whichever you prefer.
**Jremillard**: I just want to make sure it's something easily digestible for.
**Jremillard**: For everybody.
**Jdawson**: You need to match.
**Jdawson**: Jesse, what the summary page is.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, this right here.
**Jdawson**: Because that, you know what I'm talking about in our, in our master proposal, you need to match those summaries because each detail has design in it.
**Jdawson**: And so that's, I mean, yeah, we need to.
**Jdawson**: To match that.
**Jdawson**: Otherwise it's going to get way too confusing and we're not going to be able to track cost.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: Okay, so let us summarize that guys.
**Jremillard**: And, and we'll base it from, you know, just like, hey, this is kind of where we are with it.
**Jremillard**: We'll be basing it on the, the schedule that you guys have with the know the phases on it that was just up on the screen.
**Jremillard**: And then we'll kind of break.
**Jremillard**: Break out each of those and what the buildings look like in terms of square footages and things and the complexity.
**Jremillard**: Get that back to them.
**Jremillard**: We'll write the proposals based on that.
**Jremillard**: But I think, I think I understand how this is working.
**Jremillard**: I guess one of the things that I might want to suggest too would be perhaps bringing in two, two different MEP engineers.
**Jremillard**: You know, just this might overwhelm one firm nep.
**Jremillard**: One firm just from a coordination effort.
**Jremillard**: You know, we're just touching on that briefly.
**Jdawson**: Well, I would think that for the, the easies like the townhomes and everything like Jesse, I would think that we would just do design build for the MEPs because it's a pretty simple design.
**Jdawson**: What do you think?
**Bclymer**: Well, there again when it comes to if we're going to have our subs on board and signed up by the time they can before we get a permit like on that might be difficult to do.
**Gmarquez**: One of the, you know, when I was talking.
**Gmarquez**: When I was talking to Kim Lee Horn for map.
**Gmarquez**: You know, one of the things that he did mention and something that he might.
**Gmarquez**: I think he.
**Gmarquez**: He would advocate for is like, or.
**Gmarquez**: Or just ask you guys is are you guys thinking of doing like a central power station for the area itself to be able to feed all these things, or do you think you're gonna try to account for it, you know, structure by structure?
**Gmarquez**: Because there might be.
**Gmarquez**: It might be worthwhile to have a power plant on the island or somewhere to be able to account for all the mechanical.
**Jdawson**: I mean, where.
**Jdawson**: I mean, if we're going to do it.
**Jdawson**: You talking about like a cep?
**Jdawson**: It showed water.
**Gmarquez**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jdawson**: I mean, first of all, you got to think about it like the real estate that's going to take up is so valuable.
**Jdawson**: And really the only reason to do that is if we're going to hold on to this thing for 20 years and we want to get efficiencies, we're not build this thing up.
**Jdawson**: So I.
**Jdawson**: We don't care about efficiencies as far as, you know, getting paid back long term.
**Jremillard**: That's.
**Jremillard**: That answers the question.
**Jremillard**: That's fine.
**Jremillard**: You know, the other thing to consider too is we do a lot of work with PDI as design bill on.
**Jremillard**: On stuff too.
**Jremillard**: So they might be worth a phone call from.
**Jremillard**: From you guys just to kind of look at that.
**Jdawson**: So one.
**Jdawson**: One of our partners is North Star, and so we have to work with them and use their materials.
**Bclymer**: Got it.
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Building and stuff.
**Jdawson**: And then the.
**Jdawson**: Another company is called Arc Edge and they are the solar panel company that we have to integrate solar into a lot of these.
**Jdawson**: Into pretty much all these buildings.
**Gmarquez**: Oh, okay.
**Jdawson**: So we have certain parameters that we have to hit for the loan structure that we're doing.
**Jdawson**: Sustainability is one of them.
**Gmarquez**: Is there any other little caveats like that that you think might be worth accounting for or accommodating?
**Jdawson**: Those are the two main design ones.
**Jdawson**: You know, for us on the construction side, we have a.
**Jdawson**: Another group that, you know, does different trades that we have to incorporate into.
**Jdawson**: Into the project.
**Gmarquez**: But as far as lighting and things like that, for instance, or like door hardware or.
**Gmarquez**: No.
**Gmarquez**: Okay, okay.
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Gmarquez**: I can't think of any other questions.
**Jremillard**: Is it okay if we talk to GVI about where they are with it and just kind of their vision of what their designs are looking at?
**Jremillard**: Because I know there's some stuff.
**Jremillard**: There was validations and basic, you know, floor plans in.
**Jremillard**: In the pack that we got.
**Jremillard**: Just want to see if that's been advanced any.
**Jremillard**: Since.
**Jremillard**: Since then.
**Jdawson**: Nothing's been advanced past what you see.
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Gmarquez**: Is there any chance we could.
**Gmarquez**: I. I tried reaching out to Alvaro.
**Gmarquez**: I think he might be out and about last week, so I. I did not get a hold of him.
**Gmarquez**: I don't know if there's anything that you have that he'd be.
**Gmarquez**: That you can share, but I'll.
**Gmarquez**: I'll try reaching out to Alvaro again and see what the latest and greatest is.
**Jremillard**: I don't think this drawing was in the pack.
**Jremillard**: Would you mind sending this one over with the dates on it to the buildings?
**Jremillard**: This is really helpful.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: Now this is great, guys.
**Jremillard**: I really appreciate you thinking of us.
**Jremillard**: Danny and I are going to work on this week.
**Jremillard**: On it this week.
**Jremillard**: And.
**Jremillard**: And yeah, we'll get you something as.
**Jremillard**: As quick as we can.
**Jremillard**: And if we have.
**Jremillard**: We might have some more questions.
**Jremillard**: We'll reach out if we do.
**Jremillard**: But if you guys think of anything else that might be, you know, you think might be valuable to.
**Jremillard**: To us, you know, please send it through so we'll.
**Jremillard**: We find the proposal as best we can.
**Bclymer**: Okay, Sounds good.
**Gmarquez**: Awesome.
**Jremillard**: Brandon, huge project.
**Gmarquez**: Thanks for the time, man.
**Jremillard**: Amazing.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah, for sure.
**Jdawson**: It's a.
**Jdawson**: It's a good project.
**Jdawson**: So, yeah, look forward to it.
**Jdawson**: And you know, I gotta keep figuring out stuff on the.
**Jdawson**: On our end to get everything finalized and you know, hopefully, hopefully we can get it all closed by, you know, the next three months and hit the ground running.
**Gmarquez**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: When would you envision us starting on it if.
**Jremillard**: If we're successful as far as.
**Jdawson**: If we're.
**Jremillard**: It's just the drawing side because we're going to need some time to really ramp this up.
**Jdawson**: So I mean, you know, in reality, like.
**Jremillard**: Would we start before you close it with the drawing or would you wait until you close?
**Jdawson**: So, I mean, so I would say, you know, October, you know, beginning of October would probably be the, you know, the latest, I would think.
**Jdawson**: I mean, I expect to get, you know, fun like our first tranche of funding, you know, in November.
**Gmarquez**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Cool.
**Jdawson**: All right, let us know if you got any questions.
**Jdawson**: Appreciate the time.
**Gmarquez**: Thank you, guys.
**Gmarquez**: We'll be in touch.
**Gmarquez**: Jesse and Brandon.
**Jdawson**: Sounds good.
**Bclymer**: Sounds good.
**Jremillard**: All right, guys, thank you so much, everybody.
**Bclymer**: See you.
**Gmarquez**: Bye.
**Jremillard**: Bye.
