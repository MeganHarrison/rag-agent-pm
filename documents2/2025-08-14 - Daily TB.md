## Transcript
**Jdawson**: Hey, Jesse.
**Jdawson**: Hey, man.
**Jdawson**: You know what's really good for a sore throat is tons of meetings and talking.
**Speaker 1**: I don't even have a sore throat.
**Jdawson**: Oh, really?
**Speaker 1**: This is all from inflammation in my head, really?
**Jdawson**: So it doesn't have to talk or anything like that?
**Speaker 1**: No, it's just I sound like.
**Speaker 1**: And if I don't drink enough, then my throat starts hurting.
**Speaker 1**: Like, my body's dried right out.
**Speaker 1**: I've barely eaten anything.
**Speaker 1**: I'm down.
**Speaker 1**: I was 2:32 and before I left the Florida.
**Speaker 1**: Done.
**Speaker 1**: Now I'm 217.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, these magic pills need to start doing something.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so they're saying it's just that you basically got a sinus infection.
**Speaker 1**: That's part of it, yeah.
**Speaker 1**: But then I also got, like.
**Speaker 1**: It's super hard to sit up for a long time because I just get way too nauseous.
**Speaker 1**: And I got cramps because of dehydrated as shit.
**Speaker 1**: I can't drink enough.
**Speaker 1**: I've been pounding water.
**Jdawson**: Can't they hook you up with, like, a home iv?
**Jdawson**: You just give yourself a bag of.
**Speaker 1**: I have no idea.
**Speaker 1**: I went to the doctor at 5:45 the other night, and he didn't say a word about anything else.
**Speaker 1**: He just said, take these pills.
**Speaker 1**: It'll make it go away real fast.
**Speaker 1**: And it's like I can't eat dairy for two hours before or after I take the pill, and I have to lay down for 30 minutes.
**Speaker 1**: Minutes after I take it.
**Speaker 1**: It's like, what the.
**Speaker 1**: Am I gonna start glowing at night?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, no, I would be like, you know, as climactic as you describe these pills, like, it ain't doing no.
**Speaker 1**: That's what I'm like, how long am I supposed to sit here?
**Speaker 1**: Because there's only, like, a week's worth in there, so it seems like a Z pack or something.
**Speaker 1**: Or when you're sick, you just take those.
**Speaker 1**: But I don't have any flu or Covid.
**Jdawson**: Do you like pickle juice?
**Speaker 1**: I hate pickles.
**Jdawson**: See, I'm lucky.
**Jdawson**: I. I will drink, like, a full jar of pickle juice.
**Jdawson**: Like, I love it.
**Speaker 1**: If it's those homemade dills, I would do it.
**Speaker 1**: That's it.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, but I'm just saying, like, if you're dehydrated, there's nothing better than pickle juice.
**Jdawson**: Like, it'll right your ship.
**Jdawson**: So they used before they had Gatorade.
**Jdawson**: That's what all the athletes used.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, I'm doing Pedialyte and branch chain amino acid powder.
**Speaker 1**: And yeah, I'm trying to hydrate as much As I can because I can heal it.
**Speaker 1**: I just have no appetite.
**Speaker 1**: I eat like once a day maybe.
**Speaker 1**: But yeah, I'm just as much as I can sit up because it's con.
**Speaker 1**: I'm constantly on the phone with the guys, helping them.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jdawson**: So I only jumping in there.
**Jdawson**: It's something I think like I would be able to shorten the conversation just from kind of summarizing what's been going on.
**Jdawson**: You know, Jack drives me a little bit crazy just because there's so many things like today just coordination and it's just he does.
**Jdawson**: He doesn't have enough experience.
**Jdawson**: But these bollards not fitting foundations are off.
**Jdawson**: Like it's just from one thing after another.
**Jdawson**: And you know why?
**Jdawson**: The day before we paid, now we're like, oh wait a minute, the grades are too much.
**Speaker 1**: I mean, yeah, I think he's kind of checked out because even I've been asking him for stuff and trying to get involved with him and it just don't.
**Speaker 1**: It's like his side's not there.
**Speaker 1**: But I'd like a little more time with them just to see.
**Speaker 1**: But I already told Brandon if somebody needs to be mentioned above, then I will.
**Jdawson**: Right, yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: I mean it's just.
**Speaker 1**: Go ahead.
**Jdawson**: No, I agree.
**Jdawson**: I mean I wouldn't like.
**Jdawson**: I wouldn't put him in charge of anything.
**Jdawson**: No size.
**Speaker 1**: No.
**Speaker 1**: Even this by himself is too much.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And that's crazy.
**Jdawson**: So like I don't know, you need to step up and get it and that's why it's good that you are able to just spend the rest of this job with them.
**Jdawson**: And at the end of it it's like listen Jack, this is just way over your head.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Unless you.
**Jdawson**: Sorry, no, go ahead.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, I.
**Speaker 1**: It's going to take me a little bit and I just not getting jack shit done being feeling like this with between helping the guys.
**Speaker 1**: But I do have a lot of stuff that I want to put down on paper for you guys to kind of see.
**Speaker 1**: And like yeah, this.
**Speaker 1**: This would be really good to implement and yeah, this would be really good to do.
**Speaker 1**: And then I also want to be writing SOPs.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Speaker 1**: To kind of like ultimately build a training manual.
**Speaker 1**: And I got to talk to Brandon about having a folder dedicated to that on the drive.
**Jdawson**: Well, it is, I think.
**Jdawson**: I don't know if you have access to it or not.
**Jdawson**: But.
**Speaker 1**: I also want to store his videos in there because they're awesome.
**Jdawson**: Which ones?
**Speaker 1**: The ones like he made about teaching people how to understand spire sprinkler.
**Speaker 1**: Heads and scheduling.
**Speaker 1**: Those are huge.
**Speaker 1**: If he.
**Speaker 1**: Any of those he has.
**Speaker 1**: So we can have a training folder which.
**Jdawson**: Can you show me?
**Jdawson**: Share your screen.
**Jdawson**: Show me which folders you have.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, let me get to it.
**Speaker 1**: So my folders are up and I think they're fixed, but this is.
**Speaker 1**: I have this Brandon Clymer, Alito Group.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Open it.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Speaker 1**: It's this right here.
**Jdawson**: And if you go to executive.
**Jdawson**: What's in there?
**Jdawson**: There you go.
**Jdawson**: So you see, it's policy and procedures.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, cool.
**Jdawson**: So you can just add to it.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: But I also want to make a spot for the guys to go for it.
**Speaker 1**: You know what I mean?
**Jdawson**: I don't know.
**Jdawson**: It have to get with Maria.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So see, ask her where she shares this with the guys.
**Jdawson**: I'm not sure how she gets.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, okay.
**Speaker 1**: Because I just don't want new hires to get skipped on this stuff.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: And the other thing that I know I'm going to ask you if I can do is take on the headhunting for the construction guys.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, for sure.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: And that if I can, if Maria can manage like an Indeed posting, then I'll take care of the resumes and the screenings and then as long as you get final blessing on the guy, whoever talking to them.
**Speaker 1**: But that way you guys can give me projections of what you think you're going to need.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: And I can build a resume base because that's a lot of what I do is hire people and that whole end of it, train them in.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: That'd be awesome.
**Jdawson**: I never have time.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Well, I think I can do a lot for what Brandon specifically said he wanted to hire me for and what my main role is.
**Speaker 1**: So I just got to put it together.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: But yeah, I mean, all the years of traveling and working extreme remote and not so remote.
**Speaker 1**: I've seen what works and what doesn't.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: No, that would be.
**Jdawson**: I love all of it.
**Jdawson**: So, I mean, you just tell me, like, it like once.
**Jdawson**: Maria, maybe we just need to have like that HR folder.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: For everyone.
**Jdawson**: And then you can.
**Jdawson**: Because not everyone can see this executive folder.
**Speaker 1**: That's.
**Speaker 1**: That's what I mean.
**Speaker 1**: I just want a generic, a general space where the guys can go.
**Speaker 1**: Because I also want to keep templates in there because they're up the templates.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Like that new estimating template.
**Speaker 1**: We definitely need something more broken out if we're gonna have them do it.
**Speaker 1**: But it's good to have them do it so they learn.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So I create and like we'll have everything in here that's protected.
**Jdawson**: And then you'll have a folder, a shared one that everyone else.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Get into.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: And I'll just manage it and keep it on my desktop so in case anybody screws something up in there.
**Speaker 1**: But it should just be going there and make copies of stuff and use it reference.
**Speaker 1**: And then I won't do anything without running it by you first.
**Speaker 1**: Of course.
**Speaker 1**: So I'm not going to go rogue on you or nothing.
**Speaker 1**: One of the things that I've already kind of started doing is individual help.
**Speaker 1**: So.
**Speaker 1**: Like, Mike is writing custom punch lists for his scopes of work right before they're complete.
**Speaker 1**: So he knows what exactly to look at, and it helps him remember the skill.
**Speaker 1**: And I want to have Jack start doing the same thing, but I don't know if he's going to be able to stick to it.
**Jdawson**: You know what's funny is maybe you already know this, but Mike is.
**Jdawson**: Was a friend of Jack's that he brought on afterwards.
**Speaker 1**: I kind of picked up that they know each other.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So after Jack was hired and we needed a traveler, this guy said yes.
**Jdawson**: And I was talking to AJ Today because he's struggling with Alex in Indianapolis.
**Jdawson**: There's a guy that Glenn know they're used to work with.
**Jdawson**: He's like a mason by trade, but he wants to get into superintendent.
**Jdawson**: And he said he doesn't mind traveling.
**Jdawson**: He's a single guy, no kids.
**Jdawson**: So it might be something if you want to interview him.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I'll talk to Glenn about getting his dress band.
**Jdawson**: Well, I have.
**Jdawson**: If you go to the.
**Jdawson**: Go back to the.
**Jdawson**: If you go back one into this folder, the resumes.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: See if I can find it.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, because isn't that Alex guy leaving?
**Jdawson**: Alex Hudel.
**Speaker 1**: Isn't there an Alex that's leaving?
**Speaker 1**: Did somebody give their notice or something?
**Jdawson**: What's news to me?
**Speaker 1**: Oh, I may have misheard something, but I thought somebody said that guy was sleeping.
**Speaker 1**: But don't.
**Speaker 1**: I don't want to be starting rumor mill.
**Speaker 1**: I just heard wrong.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: When you think of that guy's name, let me know who he is.
**Speaker 1**: And then who manages the guy's pto?
**Jdawson**: So they get sent to Maria.
**Jdawson**: And typically she would ask me, so it would just.
**Jdawson**: I'll let her know to send them to you.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Perfect coordinate.
**Jdawson**: Get off or not.
**Jdawson**: Like.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, yeah, yeah, I know how to do all that.
**Speaker 1**: And then coding my time, I would.
**Jdawson**: Just split it out across all your jobs.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: And then what about estimating time?
**Speaker 1**: Do we build towards that or just active jobs?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we don't have that set up yet, so it's just.
**Jdawson**: You have to just build it to active jobs.
**Jdawson**: You know, if you're estimating for the same client, maybe you have an open job, go that route, you know?
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Coded to their job.
**Jdawson**: That's what like, Kevin was asking me today.
**Jdawson**: You know, he was expensing a trip to Martinsville.
**Jdawson**: It's Radial as a client.
**Jdawson**: Oh, we got Radial, Avon Radio, two jobs in Indy for them.
**Jdawson**: So just codes it to there.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: And then are we only doing straight eight on coding?
**Jdawson**: That's right.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: I didn't think you wanted real hours on those.
**Jdawson**: No.
**Speaker 1**: And then I. I'm shooting.
**Speaker 1**: I highly doubt I'm gonna get it done, but I told Brandon earlier this week I was shooting for Friday to get the PSR SOP drafted so you guys could see it.
**Speaker 1**: I might take another day or two because I just got so much shit.
**Speaker 1**: I still got to go through those pay apps you asked me to do and all that stuff.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I'm going through AJ's PSRs now and then in that same executive folder.
**Jdawson**: See how there's the PSR folder.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: So I've asked Ashley if he's going to start a new folder each month so we don't have to search all over the place.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, awesome.
**Jdawson**: And so this, this is 2507.
**Jdawson**: So that's the July one.
**Jdawson**: She's going to move all of them into there.
**Speaker 1**: Perfect.
**Jdawson**: And then.
**Jdawson**: And then we can all just review and approve them in there instead of again trying to find them everywhere.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Do we have a spot that gives a project directory of who's on what projects?
**Jdawson**: I started one in a schedule format here.
**Speaker 1**: Because just knowing who's where would be nice.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: See, and I can run with that with the guys.
**Speaker 1**: That's fine.
**Speaker 1**: You can just make an Excel one that's generic.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: And then I'm also gonna make.
**Speaker 1**: Be sending some stuff out.
**Speaker 1**: So when it comes to AJ and his projects, do you want me to just leave it up to him what he wants to do as far as like, does he want to be issuing look aheads with his weekly reports and things like that?
**Jdawson**: No, we just.
**Jdawson**: We need to standardize it across the company.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Because I just don't know if that's going to leave him without enough support to get his stuff done, having to do that stuff.
**Jdawson**: Well, that's where Alex just needs to step up.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: I mean, he should be doing the schedules.
**Jdawson**: AJ was asking about a two Week.
**Jdawson**: Look ahead today, how to do it in the job planner, which I don't know but I know some of the guys do it, so.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I mentioned it to him a while back.
**Speaker 1**: I just didn't want to be stepping on his toes if he's got a different arrangement.
**Jdawson**: We're all trying to.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Get standardized.
**Speaker 1**: So what did you think of that PSR for Kevin today?
**Speaker 1**: Do you think that's a little different than what you're used to?
**Jdawson**: When did he send it?
**Speaker 1**: This morning.
**Speaker 1**: Or it would have been yesterday.
**Speaker 1**: Sorry.
**Jdawson**: Let me see.
**Speaker 1**: Yesterday at 10:53am my time.
**Speaker 1**: So just before 2:00 clock air time.
**Speaker 1**: It's going to be a slow process getting everybody trained in strong where they need to work on.
**Speaker 1**: But it should be noticeable with improvement on things.
**Jdawson**: Here we go.
**Speaker 1**: He did a real nice job explaining his budget.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: So this is kind of one thing like if I can.
**Speaker 1**: If someone can become good enough to teach this to other guys, that's awesome.
**Speaker 1**: If they can help him out on this kind of stuff.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: Remaining buyout.
**Jdawson**: So we have really no process change orders to date just pending on us.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: It sounds like they're all hinging on one that was decided on yesterday at that meeting.
**Speaker 1**: So now he can go through and do it because they.
**Speaker 1**: That Japanese guy said it's approved and now they're just talking about signing it.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: And then I did.
**Speaker 1**: Really?
**Speaker 1**: I don't think I had any others.
**Speaker 1**: I was.
**Speaker 1**: AJ came in like a rock star and sent all his in the way that we talked about doing for next month.
**Speaker 1**: But I don't think I.
**Speaker 1**: There's everything that was active besides the couple we talked about were just one and done short projects.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: See here.
**Jdawson**: So we had superintendent for labor and the buck to the number 12.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Dad is explained.
**Jdawson**: So that stuff is change orders that are written just not processed yet.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: They're all sitting there pending waiting on that one with the two options that was talked about yesterday.
**Jdawson**: Why is.
**Jdawson**: So he didn't add money for your senior PM Costco?
**Speaker 1**: Not yet.
**Speaker 1**: He had so much modificate modifying to do to this budget to get it to what it looks like right now yesterday.
**Speaker 1**: But I also haven't started coding anything.
**Speaker 1**: I wanted to talk to you about it and see how you wanted me to do it.
**Speaker 1**: So I didn't it out.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And they don't.
**Jdawson**: That time sheet kind of sucks because like not all the jobs like the county's horrible.
**Jdawson**: It doesn't automatically start the new jobs that get started.
**Jdawson**: So there's like, you know, they got to go in and manually add that.
**Jdawson**: It's a little difficult, but.
**Jdawson**: So this.
**Jdawson**: What is the $17,000 expense?
**Jdawson**: Indirect loss.
**Jdawson**: What was that for?
**Jdawson**: Project manager.
**Speaker 1**: He says it in here somewhere.
**Speaker 1**: We talked about it yesterday.
**Speaker 1**: I just don't remember.
**Speaker 1**: Measure expense.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I don't remember exactly what it is, but I know we talked about it.
**Speaker 1**: He's got his note on there because they got the.
**Speaker 1**: The 40k is the ad for the additional superintendent hours.
**Speaker 1**: That's on that newest change order.
**Speaker 1**: That was the alternate they moved up to the gcs.
**Jdawson**: Oh, yeah, yeah.
**Jdawson**: So that.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that makes sense.
**Jdawson**: That was the recruiter fee we paid for Kevla.
**Jdawson**: So that makes expense.
**Jdawson**: It's PM expense.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, gotcha.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that's right.
**Speaker 1**: Use the recruiter.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, I saw the cybercoders folder in that resume folder.
**Speaker 1**: I know quite a few of those people.
**Jdawson**: I have 10 invitations a week from them on LinkedIn.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, they called me a lot because they've had the same number forever.
**Speaker 1**: So that's all I really got for now.
**Speaker 1**: I just.
**Speaker 1**: I gotta have time to put stuff together and try to start getting done.
**Speaker 1**: I think these.
**Speaker 1**: I don't know how much their fires will go out with time, but.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, it's a lot of explaining.
**Speaker 1**: Just project things to them or Glenda's having trouble.
**Jdawson**: What is it now?
**Jdawson**: Or just everything?
**Speaker 1**: I don't know.
**Speaker 1**: Is your door always closed in these meetings?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, good.
**Speaker 1**: I'd still like some time with him, but, man, he fucking cries about the dumbest shit.
**Speaker 1**: It's like, what are you doing, dude?
**Speaker 1**: And he doesn't think I ask him all the time.
**Speaker 1**: Glenn, tell me when you have a problem and he doesn't tell me.
**Speaker 1**: And like yesterday when we had that call with Brandon to look at his change order, he wrote, he's like, while I have you on the line, I have this problem and I'm not sure what to do.
**Speaker 1**: It's like, glenn, it's a simple fucking problem.
**Speaker 1**: All you had to do was tell me you had it and we could have solved it off this meeting.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, exactly.
**Speaker 1**: It's like, dude, if he doesn't understand that part, it's just not gonna.
**Speaker 1**: He's not gonna fit in.
**Jdawson**: Oh, two.
**Jdawson**: I mean, I don't want to be a clock watcher, but, like, he isn't in the office.
**Jdawson**: I was on the phone with AJ and he was talking to Chad.
**Jdawson**: He's not at the job site.
**Jdawson**: And then so I'm like, we'll just give him a call and See where he's at.
**Jdawson**: So AJ calls him and he's just.
**Jdawson**: This is like 8:30 and he's just pulling up to the foundation's job site for who knows why.
**Jdawson**: I mean, and I told him point black when I, when I was there a couple weeks ago, I show up in the office and it's like, I don't know, 7:45 and he comes rolling in and then 4:55 he's rolling out.
**Jdawson**: And I told him, I said, you know, honestly, that pisses me off like that.
**Jdawson**: It's like it doesn't matter to you.
**Jdawson**: Like you're absolutely done with everything you got to get done, but you roll in whenever and you roll out whenever.
**Jdawson**: So, you know.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And if that's the type.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I know what you mean.
**Jdawson**: So it's just the point of that is I, I don't want people like that.
**Jdawson**: Like, if he was kicking ass and getting his done, who cares?
**Jdawson**: But he's not.
**Jdawson**: And then so now unless me or Brandon or someone's in that office, like, who knows if they show up at all.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: You know, and so.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, it's just not worth it.
**Speaker 1**: No, I mean, he was even.
**Speaker 1**: He cried twice about the fucking daily huddle meeting time yesterday.
**Speaker 1**: Once in the meeting, it's like, dude, what does it matter?
**Speaker 1**: Is that.
**Speaker 1**: Dude.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, he didn't want it at one.
**Speaker 1**: It's like I talked to Chad and that's when he said it would work for them and would work for me because everything else I have is in the morning.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: And I'm just like, what is this, your fucking nap time or something?
**Speaker 1**: Dude, why are you so butthurt?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I'm surprised he didn't love it because he can definitely be up by one o' clock and begin to work.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: And I think he liked it in the mornings because that was how he remembered everything he needed to do every day.
**Jdawson**: But that's a problem.
**Speaker 1**: I'll work with him.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I'll work with him some more, but I just, I can't see this being the right place for him.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, no, I must say, I. I agree.
**Jdawson**: So, yeah, it's up to you.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I'd like to talk to that guy that you mentioned, when you remember his name, and then see about getting something set up to start getting some new resumes in so we have some options so we're not down completely.
**Speaker 1**: You know what I mean?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I mean.
**Jdawson**: And can you call that kid back?
**Jdawson**: I don't know.
**Jdawson**: I didn't follow up with him to see why he didn't accept our job or.
**Jdawson**: Have you talked to him since?
**Speaker 1**: Oh, I can call him, but I don't think I need to.
**Speaker 1**: I think I can answer it for you.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: We offered him less than what he's.
**Jdawson**: Getting thought he told me that's what he was making.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I know, but if you look at it, the kid was.
**Speaker 1**: Did not want to be working remote.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: And he wanted to be back in Indiana.
**Speaker 1**: But the offer letter, we said it says that boilerplate stuff that Mike did that said you need to be open to relocation to projects and all that stuff and this, the thing that I.
**Speaker 1**: That matters to someone like him is he doesn't have any seniority.
**Speaker 1**: But the.
**Speaker 1**: What.
**Speaker 1**: What he's got there.
**Speaker 1**: So if he's, you know, like he's next in line to be put back in their main office and quit doing remote when they hire another project engineer.
**Speaker 1**: You know what I mean?
**Jdawson**: I gotcha.
**Speaker 1**: So he would just come to work for us with the same unknown, with less seniority and gets in his mind just get sent right back out to what he's doing for the same price.
**Speaker 1**: I'd be glad to talk to him, but.
**Speaker 1**: Well, I think we should work on his offer a little bit first.
**Jdawson**: Well, find out if that is the case.
**Jdawson**: Then we can change the offer letter around because he could start immediately in the office helping A.J.
**Jdawson**: out.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, because I think he'd be a good kid.
**Speaker 1**: He's just going to be real fragile.
**Speaker 1**: Like he's.
**Speaker 1**: Like he's not going to have very thick skin at all.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: But yeah, I'd be happy to call him.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: If you don't mind, reach out to him.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: I'm gonna wait and see if I sound better tomorrow to do it though.
**Speaker 1**: But I'll do it.
**Speaker 1**: I'll do it tomorrow morning no matter what.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, Just tell him, Jesse, there's a reason he's single because he can't read any.
**Jdawson**: Any other persons like body language or take any hints.
**Jdawson**: So unless you're very blunt, he's not gonna understand.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, he's.
**Speaker 1**: I know.
**Speaker 1**: He's just got good training, a.
**Speaker 1**: Well, a well versed base of knowledge.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: But I think we also need to get some guys that have been around a while.
**Jdawson**: Oh, for sure.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: I think we should have a kind of a ratio that we comfortably operate on in that regard.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Was I talking to you?
**Jdawson**: Were we talking or.
**Jdawson**: No, it was me and Brandon.
**Jdawson**: We went and took the intern out for lunch.
**Jdawson**: Ian.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: He's going to be a great guy.
**Jdawson**: Oh yeah.
**Speaker 1**: He is but architecture.
**Jdawson**: He asked what you could.
**Jdawson**: Like what is if you could jump forward or change one thing about this company, what would it be?
**Jdawson**: And I said I would jump forward to five years.
**Jdawson**: And we got a bunch of experienced people because thinking about it like, Nick's the most experienced person we got.
**Jdawson**: Other than you.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: When it comes to construction management.
**Jdawson**: So like, you know, all these other guys won two years max.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, they, they need some.
**Speaker 1**: A lot of.
**Speaker 1**: Excuse me.
**Speaker 1**: A lot of direction.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: But.
**Speaker 1**: That'S cool.
**Speaker 1**: That's kind of what I like doing anyway.
**Speaker 1**: So I, I'm in a long sleeve shirt today.
**Speaker 1**: It's 110 degrees out there, Freezing.
**Jdawson**: Inside.
**Jdawson**: What do you keep your temp on.
**Speaker 1**: The 80.2, 80.4 right now.
**Speaker 1**: I actually turned the AC down the past couple days.
**Speaker 1**: I've never done that before.
**Jdawson**: Really?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Mine's 76 and I still get called.
**Speaker 1**: Oh.
**Speaker 1**: I don't know what's going on with me, man.
**Speaker 1**: It's.
**Speaker 1**: It's like this shit triggers estrogen in you or something.
**Jdawson**: That's funny.
**Jdawson**: She's.
**Jdawson**: I was walking out to lunch the other.
**Jdawson**: Or in from lunch the other day and this lady like, it's so hot out here, I'm like, I think it's pretty nice.
**Jdawson**: I said, it's too cold in that building.
**Jdawson**: She's like, oh my God, no.
**Jdawson**: All us women were like, estrogen out, like.
**Jdawson**: And thank God I'm not a woman.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Thanks.
**Speaker 1**: That's what I got.
**Speaker 1**: And I think that trench is going to be fine.
**Speaker 1**: I don't know how nuts we want to get with it at Uniqlo, but Jack's or Mike's putting pictures up today.
**Speaker 1**: They didn't grind and polish it, but it's down to grade and the overcuts are filled and there's going to be two compressors sitting there.
**Jdawson**: Is it in?
**Jdawson**: Job planner.
**Speaker 1**: He'S putting them in the onedrive.
**Speaker 1**: I just don't know if he put them in there yet because we just talked about that like an hour and a half ago.
**Jdawson**: So the plumbers came back and polished it.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: They didn't polish it.
**Speaker 1**: They scraped and cleaned it.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So now like the clean out and the greased or the oil sand separator.
**Jdawson**: That's all.
**Jdawson**: Looks nice.
**Speaker 1**: It should.
**Speaker 1**: That's what the.
**Speaker 1**: That's the pictures I'm waiting for.
**Speaker 1**: But they didn't.
**Speaker 1**: I don't, I couldn't find anything in their contract that included.
**Jdawson**: Polishing it.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Or epoxy floor finish or any kind of floor Finish in that closet.
**Jdawson**: Because the architects like their scope sheet for the job.
**Jdawson**: Anything about doing anything but just pouring it back.
**Speaker 1**: That'S not surprising.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So half ass.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, well, that's like that Ahmed, he's the architect in the meeting, he's just like, you know, we don't know.
**Jdawson**: That wasn't our scope to figure finishes out, so.
**Speaker 1**: But it's not going to be very much to cover that.
**Speaker 1**: I think even if we need to do a little grind of polish on the concrete, as long as they have some material to REM move, it's not going to be very much if we have to.
**Speaker 1**: Just in terms of not pissing off a client for some half assed job.
**Speaker 1**: But it sounds like we don't want to keep these guys anyway.
**Jdawson**: Well, I mean, Brandon talks that way, but we're going to make a bunch of money on this job, so.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, it seems like it.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: We're gonna make at least I would say 900,000.
**Jdawson**: I would have, I would assume.
**Jdawson**: Unless we screw something up.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, that's nice.
**Jdawson**: But it's almost like they are the type that will if you don't stand up to them.
**Jdawson**: Like this whole insurance thing that pisses me off.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, that's ridiculous.
**Jdawson**: They're right into the contract.
**Jdawson**: You got to get our insurance.
**Jdawson**: You got to get.
**Jdawson**: Okay, here's your insurance in.
**Jdawson**: This is what it costs.
**Jdawson**: Oh, no, no, we don't need that much.
**Jdawson**: Well, it's like, like who's talking to who on your end when you set this up, you know?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah.
**Speaker 1**: I'm still trying to learn all the fine details of what's going on with everyone's stuff, but I'll get there.
**Jdawson**: And I told Brandon that the other day.
**Jdawson**: I'm like, when I started here, we had nearly like not even close to the amount of we got going on now.
**Jdawson**: And I said it just takes a minute to get caught up and get to know who people are and like find out what is and what's real so you can interpolate what you get told.
**Speaker 1**: And yeah, four to six weeks usually is where I land at having enough of a handle to just take everything and run with it.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Of dedicated time learning it.
**Jdawson**: That's why I want you to get to know Andrew because you know, as you move in then you can be calling him up and making these decisions.
**Jdawson**: You know, he's got a quite a bit of autonomy to make calls on things and that's cool.
**Jdawson**: You know, once this the, you know, we got that Allison or Andersonville Excel center that's going to start soon.
**Jdawson**: I still got to finish.
**Jdawson**: I got to throw these budgets together for those two retail stores.
**Jdawson**: So I'm gonna put them together and get them by tomorrow.
**Jdawson**: I gotta get them back sent out and then I don't.
**Jdawson**: What's that?
**Speaker 1**: I was just gonna say I don't mind talking owners at all.
**Speaker 1**: I'm very used to it.
**Jdawson**: Right, yeah.
**Jdawson**: So what I'm saying is you get to know them, then you can step in and.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I don't have to be in that conversation either.
**Speaker 1**: And yeah, they usually warm up to me pretty quick.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Well, now it's all great stuff.
**Jdawson**: It's everything I envisioned you would be doing.
**Speaker 1**: So, yeah, I just.
**Speaker 1**: It's.
**Speaker 1**: I really enjoy it.
**Speaker 1**: I just need to not feel like this and so I can actually do what I want to do.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, this would do it at nine days.
**Jdawson**: That is crazy.
**Jdawson**: Like, if I was sick that long, I think I was like, the end.
**Speaker 1**: That's kind of what I thought it was because I haven't felt.
**Speaker 1**: I haven't felt like flu sick.
**Speaker 1**: But if I don't feel better by Monday, I'm gonna go call the doctor again.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Didn't you say you went in and had IVs or like you had IDs?
**Jdawson**: Was that that right when you quit the other job they had get you all rehydrated?
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, when I went to the er, the two times I went, once in the middle of March was the first time.
**Speaker 1**: And then I went on June 28th when I told you about it the next day or whatever.
**Speaker 1**: And Yeah, I had IVs, and that's why they kept me there so long, was to keep fluids in me because I was so drained.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: At the hospital, once you're done in your room.
**Speaker 1**: And I didn't do this till the second visit because I was in critical care, the first one.
**Speaker 1**: But they bring you to, like, this little stall with nothing but a recliner in it, and you just sit there and suck fluids, like, through your IV.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, it's just curtains.
**Speaker 1**: So there's like 12 people sitting there in these little things.
**Speaker 1**: But, yeah, I'll be fine.
**Speaker 1**: I don't.
**Speaker 1**: I gotta lay down a little bit here and there because it's just sitting up too long.
**Speaker 1**: But I've been able to stay for full days and everything and keep the guys moving.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Tuesday, I only ended up getting about two hours.
**Speaker 1**: And I tried to take a nap, and Glenn called me.
**Jdawson**: My car's out of gas.
**Jdawson**: What should I do?
**Speaker 1**: Well, that's what he did yesterday morning.
**Speaker 1**: He called me at like 7:45 and I'm like hey man, do you need something?
**Speaker 1**: And he's like no, I'm just calling you just to see what's up.
**Speaker 1**: I'm like dude, I.
**Speaker 1**: It's like behind as fuck trying to get shit done.
**Speaker 1**: No, it's 7:45 my time.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: I'm like, man, it's a bad thing to be not having anything to do and calling me and telling me.
**Jdawson**: Well, I don't know why he thinks he's got nothing to do when.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, huh.
**Jdawson**: Oh, go ahead.
**Speaker 1**: I'm on the phone with him a lot.
**Jdawson**: Well.
**Jdawson**: And what drives me crazy and I start typing things, I'm like no, I'm gonna not stir that up.
**Jdawson**: But when I asked him about the submittals and my point was, is like we let them order material without a submittal and him saying well it's because they got fired in the time frame we were getting submittals.
**Jdawson**: Well that was like three, four months after we started like the design of the contract on this job.
**Jdawson**: So instead of like I hate that he won't just say no, I didn't get the submittals in a timely manner.
**Jdawson**: It's always someone else's ex like their fault.
**Speaker 1**: But it's a 20 minute explanation.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, it's like, you know, submittals are due that, you know, I always put it in 10 days from notice to proceed or a contract.
**Jdawson**: You owe submittals not three months later.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, that stuff's all got to be deadlined.
**Speaker 1**: I mean don't send them any money for anything unless you get that simple.
**Jdawson**: And look like, look at our, Let me look at our, Let me look in this folder if I got one.
**Speaker 1**: On.
**Jdawson**: On that subject.
**Jdawson**: And that's like One of those SOPs we need is submittables and RFIs.
**Speaker 1**: And so when I get to the point I can actually start moving on sops, I'm going to send you a list of five that I'm planning to prioritize and if you want to change any, that's totally fine.
**Speaker 1**: Just so I know like what, what's needed and what isn't urgent.
**Speaker 1**: So I can prioritize those.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: But I have a note going of all that stuff and then I do I message those guys in teams a lot during the meetings of shit that yeah, we'll go over this and we'll go over that.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, you don't get anything on it.
**Jdawson**: But.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I talked to him about those submittals last night.
**Speaker 1**: It sounds like that company hired two brothers to run an H VAC division for him and they under bid everything and screwed everything up.
**Speaker 1**: So they fired those two and they literally don't have an H VAC division anymore.
**Jdawson**: Damn.
**Speaker 1**: So it's probably a blessing in disguise.
**Speaker 1**: We didn't use them anyway.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So they have no employees that do H Vac.
**Jdawson**: They just had a couple.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, they just had a couple they hired.
**Speaker 1**: And they were also doing the estimating and project management.
**Speaker 1**: I think she said they had one service tech that they're just letting button stuff up before he goes away.
**Speaker 1**: But those should all just be generic manufacturer warranties that can be pulled off the websites if we need them that way.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I still on the one Goodwill.
**Jdawson**: The first job I was doing when I started here, we bought the rtus and, you know, just hired the sub to do the work.
**Jdawson**: And it's nightmare for warranty.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: It's like I somehow we gotta get SNS to take over the warranty and maybe that's.
**Jdawson**: We're about to write his contract, so.
**Jdawson**: So he had included providing heaters and stuff, so his price went down.
**Jdawson**: So I would just ask him, hey, what is this worth for you to be the warranty call person when these units don't do something.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: And write that into their contract.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, good point.
**Speaker 1**: I'll put a note on this right now.
**Jdawson**: And honestly, because we did that sns, this guy, which I like, you know, can think of his name, the.
**Jdawson**: The owner of SN or cns, like he was the one that we would call to come and do the service calls because the sub we hired for that job because they didn't sell the units, they're like.
**Jdawson**: Like, that's not us.
**Jdawson**: We're not coming out there.
**Jdawson**: So he'll do it.
**Speaker 1**: He's gonna just want something for it.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Just.
**Jdawson**: It's got a value to it because it's going to end up costing them some time.
**Jdawson**: But it ain't worth our headache.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, it's easier just to have them agree to it than put it in this contract and pay him what he wants.
**Speaker 1**: Unless it's not ridiculous, but it shouldn't be much.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I'll do that.
**Speaker 1**: I got this call for Fresno with Camden and AJ in five minutes, but I gotta call Glenn back anyway.
**Jdawson**: Okay, that sounds good.
**Speaker 1**: Thank you.
**Speaker 1**: And then I'm going to get with Nick today too.
**Speaker 1**: Still on that valve.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: All right, sounds good.
**Jdawson**: Thanks, Jesse.
**Speaker 1**: Thanks, man.
**Speaker 1**: See you.
**Jdawson**: See ya.
