## Transcript
**Bclymer**: Hey.
**Bclymer**: Hey.
**Bclymer**: Hello.
**Mewers**: Hey everyone.
**Bclymer**: Hello.
**Bclymer**: How's everyone doing?
**Steve.bishop**: All right.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Kristin**: Great here.
**Bclymer**: A little, a little depression on our side.
**Bclymer**: We had our little league team here suffering, deflating, loss.
**Bclymer**: That hurt us a little bit.
**Bclymer**: I don't know if you guys were up four, nothing.
**Kswenson**: What happened?
**Steve.bishop**: We lost.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: South Carolina had a walk off.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: The team that we beat 14, 0 the game before beat us and eliminated us.
**Bclymer**: That one hurt.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Kristin**: We need to check all those birth certificates.
**Bclymer**: Oh, yeah.
**Bclymer**: Nope.
**Mewers**: It's funny, they always have a 6:3 pitcher out there somehow 12 year old.
**Bclymer**: The Daniel Monte story over at New York.
**Rdurr**: We had our all star.
**Rdurr**: We had our all stars participating in Madison and we had some 13 year olds, girls that phenomenal.
**Rdurr**: And I was like, I cannot believe they're only 13 years old.
**Rdurr**: I said they must have joined under Steve's watch, not mine.
**Bclymer**: Right?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Kristin**: Hey, you won, so that's all that matters.
**Bclymer**: So here Christian won't be with us today.
**Bclymer**: I'm trying to bring out the.
**Bclymer**: I know we're looking at the schedule coming up here, but what I did want to do today is I have JDawson in St Germain here, Isaiah Lewis, where I'm going to give an intro into Isaiah.
**Bclymer**: He's one of the representatives.
**Bclymer**: Isaiah will talk on the background on JDawson in St Germain, also the projects that we've done and then we'll look at our scope to execute here.
**Bclymer**: Make sure any questions, comments, all that.
**Bclymer**: This would be the time upon completion of this economic impact study.
**Bclymer**: This will be one of the major points being brought forth as to whether or not this is a good opportunity for the county to pursue.
**Bclymer**: So this here is your third party verification there that county leadership would.
**Bclymer**: Would like to see.
**Bclymer**: So down St. Germain will lead that on the timeline wise.
**Bclymer**: We just, I don't know if it was yesterday or Monday.
**Bclymer**: We received the legal department, the county attorney's feedback on the redlined agreement.
**Bclymer**: So from that we're going to have an internal meeting to review the county attorney's feedback on the agreement and then see what the what and if the counter from the county will be on that for the agreement throughout that.
**Bclymer**: That same time just to make sure we're on the same page throughout that same time.
**Bclymer**: The economic impact study will be moving forward.
**Bclymer**: It's going to take anywhere from.
**Bclymer**: From likely eight weeks.
**Bclymer**: Is.
**Bclymer**: Is kind of where we're going to land on that study.
**Bclymer**: But without further ado, let me introduce Isaiah here with JDawson and St. Germain.
**Kswenson**: Hey everyone, this is.
**Kswenson**: My name is Isaiah.
**Kswenson**: Nice to meet you.
**Kswenson**: I'M the director of client relations at JDawson and St. Germain Research.
**Kswenson**: I've been with DSG a little bit background history on me.
**Kswenson**: I've been with DSG for seven plus years now.
**Kswenson**: So I'm seasoned vet veteran here at dsg.
**Kswenson**: Our work here in Seminole county has extended for over a few years now.
**Kswenson**: Currently in process we're doing a monthly visitor profile study which would be something that is utilized in this larger forecasting study that we're going to be doing for the forecasting.
**Kswenson**: And then we've also done a previous forecasting study which would be similar in scope but not exactly the same as this study that we're going to be doing here today.
**Kswenson**: We're talking about hey key metrics and things that we're going to be looking for.
**Kswenson**: For the purpose of this study we're going to be looking at out of town visitors and the spending of those out of town attendees, economic impact room nights, the overall number estimate of visitors, taxes supported jobs and wages and then also an ROI estimate of tax dollars that be recoupled over the 50 years versus the tax dollars invested.
**Kswenson**: So those are going to kind of be the main objectives that we've got going over on this study.
**Kswenson**: But I'm here to answer any more for the questions you guys have regarding it and any details that I can't provide here that I can't provide here.
**Kswenson**: We can get back to you guys over that through email.
**Bclymer**: So one of the key points here on the study is this study is being funded through the tourism account.
**Bclymer**: So it has to predominantly feature tourism information to justify the expense.
**Bclymer**: So that's why you're going to see a lot of out of town visitors.
**Bclymer**: And here is the brief.
**Bclymer**: Let me share the screen here for the study.
**Bclymer**: So here like Isaiah was saying, one of the things about JDawson in St. Germain that is key to this study.
**Bclymer**: About four years ago they did a 12 month visitor study for the county.
**Bclymer**: So JDawson in St. Germain has the most extensive visitor profile data on Seminole County.
**Bclymer**: So There was a 12 month study and along with that we do these month to month snapshots that show the expenditures, the total amount of visitors to the county, all of that.
**Bclymer**: So just point in here.
**Bclymer**: Is there any questions, comments on the on the study?
**Bclymer**: Is there concerns?
**Bclymer**: Just want to make sure we're on the same page.
**Kristin**: Hi guys, Steve here.
**Kristin**: Quick question if you don't mind.
**Kristin**: Couple actually go for it.
**Bclymer**: Steve.
**Kristin**: Yeah Isaiah, what did you say the kind of the analysis period would be?
**Kristin**: Did you say 50 years?
**Kristin**: Five?
**Kristin**: Zero.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Kswenson**: So we're going to do our analysis recoupled over the 50 year.
**Kswenson**: The 50 years, 5 year, 50 year time period.
**Kswenson**: Yes.
**Kswenson**: 5, 0.
**Bclymer**: Oh wow.
**Rdurr**: Impressive.
**Kristin**: I didn't know you go out that far.
**Kswenson**: We're going to forecast over the full 50 year lease term.
**Kristin**: Nice.
**Kristin**: And then secondly, what metrics or what measurement do you use to calculate tourism spend?
**Kristin**: Are you using like the destinations international calculator or do you have your own model?
**Kswenson**: We have our own model that will be using data that we've collected in counties.
**Kswenson**: So with our data collection that we did previously was boots on the ground data collected from your visitors in source.
**Kswenson**: So we do have a good idea of the metrics that are going on specific to Seminole county and we're going to use those in our model to help create these figures.
**Bclymer**: So Steve, I'm going to give you here, this is our, this is our most recent.
**Bclymer**: This is the one year recap that they provided to us here.
**Bclymer**: So we get this, this is an accumulation of our month to month snapshots.
**Bclymer**: So here the impact of tourism we'll get direct spending, economic impact.
**Bclymer**: These are their research and proprietary formulas are a little more extensive than the DI events calculator.
**Bclymer**: The economic impact calculator that we use, we do use it on sports side to calculate the economic impact.
**Bclymer**: But JDawson in St. Germain gets a little more granular.
**Bclymer**: So here we're looking at visitors comparisons there room, nights, lodging, metrics and giving you a heads up, JDawson in St Germain is also the research organization that's been tied into the tourism improvement district for the indoor complex.
**Bclymer**: So they're a trusted organization that the, the commissioners like the research.
**Bclymer**: They that that's the part that's tough is whenever you bring research for data there's a lot of numbers flying around from different data sources.
**Bclymer**: We focus on what is a data source that resonates with county leadership.
**Bclymer**: Before we present the data, we always make sure commissioners and county manager and deputy county manager is this data that they will trust?
**Bclymer**: Because presenting data for the sake of presenting data, we're just wasting everyone's time then.
**Bclymer**: So this is an organization that they trust with understanding Seminole county for the years that JDawson and St Germain has been with us.
**Bclymer**: So and then Isaiah.
**Bclymer**: Yeah Isaiah, you guys, what are some of the other dmos DSG works across the state of Florida?
**Bclymer**: What are some of the other ones you guys got?
**Kswenson**: Yeah, I'm gonna get to back to your first question to just jump back in on that and then I'll jump back to that.
**Kswenson**: The biggest difference I would say between US and Di's calculator and the approach is how we're approaching.
**Kswenson**: So DI is a top down approach.
**Kswenson**: They're coming from the scope of all of Florida and then circling down.
**Kswenson**: We're starting from, since we collected the data in Seminole county, we're starting from the bottom up.
**Kswenson**: So our data is just more very much directly related to Seminole county versus a visit or destinations international impact study, which is coming from the top level down and kind of filtering through state general metrics where ours is Seminole county specific metrics.
**Kswenson**: As for our research within the state of Florida and kind of our expertise down to the St. Germain research, we were currently right now with 18 different destinations in the state of Florida collecting visitor profile dating, doing forecasting and economic impact research across all those different destinations that we're working with.
**Kswenson**: We also work outside of the state of Florida in Vermont and Maine, but a lot of our bases were started here in Tallahassee with destinations across the state to highlight some.
**Kswenson**: We're working with Seminole county, obviously Ocala, we're working with Fort Myers, Naples as well as most of the southwest of Florida and then Daytona and New Smyrna beach as well.
**Kswenson**: So we're kind of working throughout the full state and all corners of it doing this type of research.
**Kswenson**: So we are in terms of marketing research, the experts in the state of Florida by far excellent.
**Kristin**: I appreciate that.
**Kristin**: And Guy kind of answered what would have been my follow up question when he used the word for park, Terry.
**Kristin**: So I assume that there's not a lot of visibility on how this is being measured.
**Kswenson**: We could get into the nitty gritty if you wanted to on a separate call and kind of discuss it all there.
**Kswenson**: But it is proprietary information in its larger scope.
**Kswenson**: But we can get into nitty gritties of it all within our methodology and kind of how we are calculating it.
**Kswenson**: See, there's a little bit of a snapshot of how we've collected our data previously.
**Kristin**: Perfect.
**Kristin**: Yeah, that'd be great.
**Kristin**: On another day, not today.
**Kristin**: Appreciate that.
**Kristin**: Thank you.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, go for it, Mike.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**Mewers**: Isaiah, in terms of job growth, are you looking at both direct and indirect?
**Mewers**: And then do you also include the construction jobs that are created during the build out of the project?
**Kswenson**: Yes, we're looking at direct, indirect and induced.
**Kswenson**: So we're looking at all.
**Kswenson**: And we're going to look at construction as well.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And on the methodology, this will, when we get to that point where the agreement is on the table for the commissioners to approve, this will either be an exhibit on the agreement or expect it to be an attachment.
**Bclymer**: So this information will.
**Bclymer**: Is expected to go public at that point.
**Bclymer**: So I just wanted everyone to know that this, we will advertise it only at the point when the.
**Bclymer**: The agreement has reached the BCC agenda.
**Bclymer**: And then of course, the methodology portion there, Steve, that, that's on there shows all their references of who they're using.
**Bclymer**: So dbpr STR Key Data Dashboard.
**Bclymer**: They have access to pretty much all the data.
**Bclymer**: I think we got you guys copied in on tourism side to everything.
**Kristin**: Yeah, that's great.
**Kristin**: Yeah, appreciate that.
**Bclymer**: No worries.
**Mewers**: Guy, question for you.
**Mewers**: So you said that this study will take about eight weeks and in parallel we're going to be negotiating the contract.
**Mewers**: You guys just got the red line back or comments on my red lines.
**Mewers**: What does that do to the timeline?
**Mewers**: Can you kind of update us now that we, you know, we've engaged this research?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So this still preliminary because one of the things that we have to do is have the internal meeting to review now your redlines and Legal's redlines.
**Bclymer**: But one of the things that was discussed is maybe a separate meeting to discuss and define rev share.
**Bclymer**: That would be a major portion of the agreement where I think that that will take a meeting within itself.
**Bclymer**: And the two big keys that I've seen still have to see internal is the rev share and leasing portion of it.
**Bclymer**: Making sure we get that identified.
**Bclymer**: Because of course, the subleasing is key to the whole collective, the rev share portion of it.
**Bclymer**: How do we clearly identify it and make sure we get it down into the detail?
**Bclymer**: Just.
**Bclymer**: I just remembered.
**Bclymer**: Mike, did you.
**Bclymer**: I don't know if I received it.
**Bclymer**: Here is.
**Bclymer**: Is your agreement with the municipality in Georgia, Is that public?
**Bclymer**: Was that, was that approved?
**Mewers**: It was approved in a hearing for the first parcel of land.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Mewers**: There's a second one that has not gone yet in front of the committee.
**Bclymer**: One of them, yes.
**Bclymer**: If there's anything public there that, that that's agreed.
**Bclymer**: If you can send me a copy of that, that would.
**Bclymer**: That would help us out.
**Bclymer**: Just because I know that was one of the questions Legal had.
**Bclymer**: We have a couple of projects, P3 projects right now similar to yours that Legal's digging through, doing the research on the organization to see if there's other agreements tied to them.
**Bclymer**: Public agreements, of course, nothing private.
**Bclymer**: So parking is your third.
**Bclymer**: I think we're, we're moving towards a good route of finding a solution towards parking.
**Bclymer**: I would say from the county perspective, this agreement is at the forefront for county leadership and the commissioners right now.
**Bclymer**: What we're running up against is the final two hearings on the budget at the end of September.
**Bclymer**: So that's where you're getting a lot of focus, solely on the budget.
**Bclymer**: And then once the budget is reviewed and possibly approved, that's when now everything that's in the backlog of these P3s that have been interested, that conversation will come to the forefront.
**Bclymer**: So reason the budget would have a implication on this agreement, whether it's approved or if it's not approved, there are portions of this agreement that will be impacted.
**Bclymer**: Maintenance and operation, for example of the sand volleyball courts FTEs that may be what you call it added for that parking wise, the funding model for the parking and understanding how, you know, we're adding an impervious surface now to an area and what again I'm speaking about construction, I don't know anything about construction.
**Bclymer**: But from our conversation, what are the impacts there for that?
**Bclymer**: So that's what September timeline, finalizing that budget will give us a clear pathway into the feasibility of this project.
**Bclymer**: I can tell you right now this project is at the forefront for county leadership and commissioners.
**Bclymer**: Every time I go to a BCC meeting, it's Gui, Gui, volleyball still.
**Bclymer**: And we, yeah, we got another meeting.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So this is, this is not the county delaying or any of that.
**Bclymer**: That this project, we're literally in the dark until we know what our budget is and we'll know at the end of September.
**Bclymer**: Cool.
**Bclymer**: But scope wise, are we good on on scope?
**Bclymer**: Is there anything that we'd like to add or remove on the scope?
**Bclymer**: Now here's the beauty.
**Bclymer**: You guys are setting the benchmark with this.
**Bclymer**: So the other agreements, the P3 side, they have not executed this economic impact.
**Bclymer**: You guys are at the forefront.
**Bclymer**: So Project Volleyball is at the forefront and pretty much the scope that you guys outline here that you're comfortable with, the other projects may be held to that scope as well.
**Bclymer**: So I'm just giving you a heads up on that.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: But if you're, you're good with it.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Again, as a reminder, it's going to be funded all through tourism.
**Bclymer**: So you don't have to worry about that.
**Bclymer**: You will not get a bill at the end of the study and then we'll have a virtual presentation by JDawson and St. Germain at the end of the study and then that'll either be Isaiah, Aaron or Joseph.
**Bclymer**: That's usually the big three that we work with over at JDawson and St. Germain.
**Rdurr**: When is the anticipated wrap up of the research?
**Bclymer**: So once you guys approve Here, I can submit this into purchasing.
**Bclymer**: So it'll be dependent on.
**Bclymer**: I have given purchasing the heads up.
**Bclymer**: This will.
**Bclymer**: We're not expecting that this will go out to rfp.
**Bclymer**: This qualifies for sole source.
**Bclymer**: So we expect this is going to go through the sole source.
**Bclymer**: I'll be able to give everyone an update upon execution of the agreement.
**Bclymer**: So whatever the date is that the agreement is executed, then you would look at counting like eight weeks from then.
**Rdurr**: And, and I'm, I'm sorry, I'm coming since I'm all new and I know I could ask Steve or Kristen this.
**Rdurr**: But the, the thought and the hope is the building is up and running when and the courts are playable.
**Rdurr**: Win if everything.
**Rdurr**: And I know I, I've worked in, you know, this space a long time, so I understand that there's always hiccups.
**Bclymer**: But yeah, that would be.
**Bclymer**: I, I don't know, Michael, if you, if, you know a timeline there on construction, what that can look like.
**Mwirsing**: Yeah, I mean, I don't.
**Mwirsing**: It just depends on when we get released.
**Mwirsing**: I mean.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah, would be upon.
**Bclymer**: I, I, procedurally it'd be upon execution of the, the agreement.
**Bclymer**: That's when the actual construction portion would begin, when everything's agreed upon at that point.
**Bclymer**: So that, that would be definitely after September closing.
**Bclymer**: The economic impact, I believe we're looking at more of a end of October, November date on the bcc.
**Bclymer**: If this is a sprint to the finish.
**Mwirsing**: All right.
**Mwirsing**: And then.
**Mwirsing**: Yeah, I mean, the other thing would be obviously, Mike, if we start doing construction docs before that gets signed or not, because, you know, we can obviously, if we wait till it gets signed, then we start doing design.
**Mwirsing**: Obviously that adds more time.
**Mwirsing**: So.
**Mewers**: Yeah, and also in the permitting process.
**Mwirsing**: Yeah, I mean, you're talking, you know, four months, you know, getting design done and permitting minimum.
**Bclymer**: So from, so from this, this is.
**Rdurr**: More of a summer now of 26 would be an aggressive date.
**Mwirsing**: Is that if you, if you said we started reality.
**Mwirsing**: If we're just going to be honest about how timelines go, December we get released to start design.
**Mwirsing**: You know, you're talking, you know, possibly having a permit by the end of March, you know, maybe April sometime.
**Mwirsing**: So let's say that, you know, we're, we're kicking off in May, I mean, depending on weather and stuff.
**Mwirsing**: I mean, Jesse, do you think we can even hit end of 26?
**Steve.bishop**: Yeah, I mean, as long we get released, we're doing the design build like we normally do, and we get everything pretty much bought out, scoped out Start in May.
**Mwirsing**: We can.
**Bclymer**: If.
**Mwirsing**: If you guys want to do a phased approach and just get the volleyball section up and running without the structures maybe or like something like that, then that could increase, you know?
**Mwirsing**: You know, because.
**Mwirsing**: But again, you're.
**Mwirsing**: You're not gonna buy a ton of time, right?
**Mwirsing**: At the end of the day, like, some of this stuff just takes time to get through.
**Mwirsing**: Right.
**Mwirsing**: When we talk about design permitting.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Kristin**: Well, Kurt and I. Kurt and I haven't discussed this, but it would be underwhelming for people to try and come play on just courts with no bathrooms, no parking.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Kristin**: That would not go over well for a friendly referral to their.
**Kristin**: To their colleagues.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: And just on the permitting side, for you guys to understand, even upon execution, it won't be a handoff to the city, the permitting department there.
**Bclymer**: You're under the city's jurisdiction at that location.
**Bclymer**: We have a very good relationship with city of Sanford, their permitting department.
**Bclymer**: At times there's due to turnover or there's been delays at times there.
**Bclymer**: But this in discussion with the city of San is a top priority for them.
**Bclymer**: So we'll make sure it won't be a handoff.
**Bclymer**: Hey, Brandon, Jesse, go see Samford and then counties out.
**Bclymer**: We'll talk to you later.
**Bclymer**: No, no, we'll.
**Bclymer**: We'll be there in support the entire time to make sure that that undefined expedited permitting is.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: There's actually a difference there between this project and other projects going in.
**Mwirsing**: Okay.
**Mwirsing**: Yeah.
**Mwirsing**: I mean, we'll do whatever we can phase it to try to start pushing dirt, you know, but.
**Mwirsing**: Yeah, I'd say again, what, Jesse?
**Mwirsing**: Maybe into 26 or maybe November?
**Mwirsing**: Is that what you're thinking?
**Steve.bishop**: Yeah.
**Steve.bishop**: By the end of 26, should be able to finish it up.
**Mwirsing**: Any other construction questions?
**Bclymer**: Cool.
**Steve.bishop**: And, you know, I know we talked about that additional parcel, and then is it the parking lot itself that that's going to be.
**Steve.bishop**: That is in our scope, but that's done by the county doing the.
**Bclymer**: So that's.
**Bclymer**: So that was in the original agreement.
**Bclymer**: Parking was done by the third party in the agreement.
**Bclymer**: It was redlined and gone back to the county.
**Bclymer**: Now we have to meet internally and see.
**Bclymer**: Okay, how is that going to work?
**Bclymer**: We've already began discussions with deputy director of development services for planning on what would be what.
**Bclymer**: How we can define this project.
**Bclymer**: Food and beverage versus entertainment district.
**Bclymer**: I think it is per their code.
**Bclymer**: There's different parking requirements for both.
**Bclymer**: So we're bringing development services in and seeing how shared parking amongst boomba all, all those conversations are currently happening at this point.
**Bclymer**: So right now, the big caveat that we're awaiting is the final decision on the budget in September.
**Bclymer**: Because, yeah, right now there isn't any.
**Bclymer**: Any increases or changes to the budget or not not occurring until we know next year's budget.
**Bclymer**: So that's.
**Bclymer**: That's what the holdup is for for the project.
**Bclymer**: And the budget has to go through two public meetings for approval.
**Bclymer**: So we have November 10th, and then the other one, I think it's the 24th or 23rd.
**Bclymer**: September.
**Bclymer**: September 10th.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, my bad.
**Mwirsing**: September 10th, with that red line on the contract that we talked about.
**Mwirsing**: And Mike, correct me if I'm wrong, that was regarding who was going to pay for the actual parking lot itself.
**Mwirsing**: I know.
**Mwirsing**: I think Jesse is alluding to when he says do it the most efficient way to do this entire thing at once.
**Mwirsing**: And so is that an option or do you guys have to go through and do a full, like, public hearing bid thing or how does that work?
**Bclymer**: That's in discussion as well.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah, we.
**Bclymer**: Look, the easier route is always one of the more preferential routes to go.
**Bclymer**: We just have to make sure legally it is a route that we can take.
**Bclymer**: So, yeah, that conversation is being had as well.
**Bclymer**: So, yeah, that's one of the reviews from legal that came in.
**Steve.bishop**: So I'm just thinking if we're permitting it in that permit process, like if it's not designed as one thing and you got someone over here trying to design a parking lot, we're over here trying to design the complex, then that can get tough too, because we're always sharing a storm system, you know, utilities where they're coming in from.
**Steve.bishop**: So I don't know if it could even be split off where we would do the whole design, even if someone else built it, you know, just to move that along.
**Steve.bishop**: While that was so good for that.
**Mwirsing**: Even for that, if they, if they have to do a public bid route, they'd have to bid the design part out, too, of it.
**Mwirsing**: So it's.
**Mwirsing**: Yeah, it's either essentially all.
**Mwirsing**: All or nothing.
**Mwirsing**: I mean, so we'll just have to wait and see.
**Mwirsing**: But obviously that, I guess that's the only thing is there's, you know, we're assuming all of this as based.
**Mwirsing**: If it was going to be one project done at once.
**Mwirsing**: The moment that we start breaking it up, that timeline kind of shifts.
**Bclymer**: So today, literally the only decision that we could have made today was the research study that was requested on justifying the investment, both for the county and the partner.
**Bclymer**: So we got that checked off so we can move that forward towards the end of September.
**Bclymer**: I'd be honest with you.
**Bclymer**: I'm looking at our schedule.
**Bclymer**: I sent out August 23rd was our next meeting.
**Bclymer**: With the timeline that we currently have, I would suggest holding off moving that meeting to the September 3rd meeting because that would be able to get an update on the study and move movement for the study.
**Bclymer**: But that still want to make sure everyone's aware.
**Bclymer**: That will still not be the point of where the decision could be made because of the budget, the legal review internally, I expect to happen prior to this with us internally saying, okay, here's what we need to do.
**Bclymer**: We'll work directly with Mike on this.
**Bclymer**: Mike, feel free to invite who you.
**Bclymer**: You'd like, but I do believe this is going to move towards two, possibly three meetings.
**Bclymer**: One defining rev share with you and two, defining the leasing and a possible third for parking.
**Bclymer**: So because these.
**Bclymer**: These topics may be of sensitive nature, you.
**Mwirsing**: You.
**Bclymer**: I'll send you the invite and you disseminate as you'd like on your side.
**Bclymer**: But yeah, okay, that's.
**Bclymer**: That's where I think we're gonna go with.
**Bclymer**: With the next couple of meetings.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Because we get that clearly defined through September and going in, that'll keep us on that October, end of October, November timeline.
**Bclymer**: That's.
**Bclymer**: That's what we'll do.
**Bclymer**: If we're going to get into the agreement, assuming that the budget passes.
**Bclymer**: That's the big assumption, is having that assumption.
**Bclymer**: What would it look like?
**Bclymer**: All right, so does anyone have any concerns with removing the August.
**Bclymer**: The August 20th meeting and just going into September 3rd.
**Kristin**: Here?
**Kristin**: I will actually be on vacation.
**Kristin**: So thank you.
**Bclymer**: So we're all good?
**Bclymer**: September 3rd.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, perfect.
**Bclymer**: So we'll go into September 3rd and internally.
**Bclymer**: Michael, I'm not going to take that.
**Bclymer**: This meeting off just yet because I'm probably going to hold that date for us to do the discussion internal with the agreement since it's already in everyone's calendar.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Mwirsing**: Great.
**Bclymer**: All right, good.
**Bclymer**: Perfect.
**Bclymer**: September 3rd will be there.
**Bclymer**: I'm going to take August 20th off everyone's calendar after I replace it with.
**Bclymer**: With our internal meeting here to make sure we get that contract discussion done internally.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right, sounds good.
**Bclymer**: All right, perfect.
**Mewers**: Thanks, everyone.
**Bclymer**: All right, everyone's good.
**Bclymer**: Thank you, everybody.
**Bclymer**: Take care.
**Bclymer**: Thank you.
