## Transcript
**Jcurtin**: Message from Jack that he wants to reschedule the meeting.
**Jdawson**: What was going on?
**Jcurtin**: He.
**Jcurtin**: He messaged me just like 30 seconds ago.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Have you heard.
**Jdawson**: Have you closed out that foundation issue?
**Jcurtin**: I asked Jack to.
**Jcurtin**: To dig down to see the depth, but I haven't heard anything back yet.
**Jcurtin**: So I'll ask him this morning.
**Jdawson**: Well, that ground is probably hardest.
**Jdawson**: That would take a day.
**Jdawson**: Like, when are they pouring the drive?
**Jcurtin**: I think they're setting the bollards today, and then maybe Monday they.
**Jcurtin**: They would pour.
**Jcurtin**: I don't know if Jack Con confirmed dates for that.
**Jdawson**: Well, they need to be two foot.
**Jdawson**: Like, you can't tell from that photo that that's two foot.
**Jdawson**: I mean, isn't that almost a three foot rebar cage that's setting in the hole, that mat that goes in the footing, typically they're 2 inches less on each side than the size of your footing.
**Jdawson**: So that would make that thing 2 foot, 8 inches.
**Jdawson**: All right, Nick, would you let us know when Jack is ready to meet?
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: I'll measure the rebar cage on Bluebeam.
**Jcurtin**: So we'll.
**Jcurtin**: We'll cancel on digging that?
**Jcurtin**: No, I guess the dimension that I get on Bluebeam.
**Jcurtin**: I'll send that to the engineer.
**Jdawson**: Just talk to me first, Nick, before you send anything else to her or Jesse.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: Let's look at it in here.
**Jcurtin**: When you find out the measurement, Nick.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: All right.
**Jdawson**: Is there anything else, Nick, that you got holding you up?
**Jcurtin**: No.
**Bclymer**: Did he talk to that?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Did Mike?
**Jdawson**: I called Mike after I talked to you.
**Jdawson**: Do you get with him?
**Jdawson**: Do you figure out what's going on with these dumpsters?
**Jcurtin**: He reviewed each sheet, each invoice, and he said they're accurate other than they gave us a charge for waiting on site.
**Jcurtin**: And he said that they shouldn't have charged us for that.
**Jcurtin**: And that was about $300.
**Bclymer**: How many dumpsters do we have?
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So, like, how many total dumpsters are there?
**Jdawson**: Are there any of these?
**Jdawson**: Like, are they just charging us for the ones he initially got?
**Jdawson**: 2.
**Jcurtin**: No, he is paying $3,500 for the initial ones, and then he ran out of credit, and that's when they started charging us for the ones after that.
**Jdawson**: Oh.
**Jdawson**: But he ran out.
**Jdawson**: We spent three times what he did.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So let me ask the question another way.
**Bclymer**: How many total dumpsters did we get?
**Jcurtin**: I'll pull that up right now.
**Bclymer**: Do you have a copy of all the invoices?
**Jcurtin**: Yes, I do.
**Jcurtin**: He's getting two dumpsters today.
**Jcurtin**: He's finishing up tomorrow.
**Jdawson**: Is it just the concrete.
**Jdawson**: Is that the last two?
**Jcurtin**: Let me get him on the phone.
**Jdawson**: Just figure it out, Nick.
**Jdawson**: Just how many dumpsters do we end up using?
**Jdawson**: When is he finishing, and is this the last two?
**Jcurtin**: He's finishing tomorrow.
**Jcurtin**: And I'll find what the last two are.
**Jdawson**: Find out how many we've had to get and make sure this is it.
**Jcurtin**: All right.
**Jdawson**: See you, Nick.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: See you.
**Jdawson**: See you, Jesse.
**Jdawson**: See, it sat.
