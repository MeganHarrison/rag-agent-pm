**Jdawson**: That meeting.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Just we just had was some good meeting agenda stuff.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Speaker 1**: I'm sorry, with whom?
**Jdawson**: With Keba.
**Speaker 1**: Oh yeah.
**Jdawson**: To issue the Uniqlo meeting agenda.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And then I have that call with Nick and Jack right after that.
**Jdawson**: And then a call with Alec.
**Jdawson**: They got my timecard fixed on Share Drive, so they want me to go and backdate everything.
**Jdawson**: Do you want me to just spread it out?
**Jdawson**: Starting from the beginning of last month.
**Speaker 1**: I told them the first two pay periods, I told them just to do half Westfield quarter Uniqlo and a quarter on Goodwill Bloomington.
**Speaker 1**: This job, you know, the one we're dealing with paving on.
**Speaker 1**: And then you can from then on just email.
**Speaker 1**: Email Jose and say it's my understanding everything's down up to 8:2.
**Speaker 1**: And I just start from there forward.
**Jdawson**: So start on 8:2.
**Speaker 1**: Well, I think the weekend.
**Speaker 1**: I don't.
**Speaker 1**: What is it?
**Speaker 1**: You know, I don't know.
**Speaker 1**: Whatever.
**Speaker 1**: They're just ask.
**Speaker 1**: Ask Jose where you need to go and backtrack your timesheets.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So Glenn's thing, he did email that paving contractor.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And are we just gonna.
**Speaker 1**: I'm just gonna tell the paving contractor list this issue isn't resolved with the city and I just don't want him talking to the city.
**Speaker 1**: But I went and did a little takeoff of the drawings plus our quote for the pavement.
**Speaker 1**: And I'm sending something out here in a second.
**Speaker 1**: jdawson, who is this meeting with?
**Speaker 1**: Oh, this is our meeting.
**Speaker 1**: Sorry, Jason, get lost on names here.
**Jdawson**: So you're having the same kind of day.
**Speaker 1**: So trying to think of this, the.
**Jdawson**: How to turn that into five grand.
**Jdawson**: What's that you're saying?
**Jdawson**: Trying to figure out how to turn 14776 into five grand.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Speaker 1**: And make the math work like this.
**Speaker 1**: Like that's really all I would have expected to get back from them, to be honest with you.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: To begin with, like how in the world he snookered have been just because it was on their schedule of values.
**Speaker 1**: That don't mean.
**Speaker 1**: And why would you give up your profit?
**Speaker 1**: We would never do that.
**Speaker 1**: You want to take away my scope?
**Speaker 1**: Fine, take the scope away.
**Speaker 1**: But we still got to be there.
**Speaker 1**: We got to manage the job.
**Speaker 1**: We got all everything else involved in the job.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: For something that's going to be done while everything else is happening.
**Jdawson**: And nothing is going to be disturbed in this area until they go and execute this city scope.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Like it's not going to be cleared grub Nothing.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: I mean, and again, like I said, like, for us to go there and, you know, while they're on site and they just clip it off like it's not even a.
**Speaker 1**: It's not even really.
**Speaker 1**: Again, the guy's got his equipment there and he just runs his blade five foot over.
**Speaker 1**: He doesn't even notice that.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: From where he would have graded to previously.
**Speaker 1**: And he's not, you know.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I'm just wondering if we can language that in or.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Like you say you're figuring on bringing a whole new crew, a whole new sub, a grading sub, your paving sub, all of the equipment, like everything.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: I have no doubt you pay that.
**Speaker 1**: That's because you got a whole separate project of people coming in and do your stuff for you.
**Speaker 1**: This was like a.
**Speaker 1**: An afterthought.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: It's like a little adder.
**Jdawson**: Does that sov.
**Jdawson**: They have.
**Jdawson**: Have a grading number or clearing number on it?
**Jdawson**: Pull it.
**Speaker 1**: No.
**Jdawson**: Are we able to.
**Jdawson**: Wondering if we're able to do anything with that initial construction.
**Jdawson**: Erosion control for another deduction off of that.
**Jdawson**: They got 2200 for construction entrance and staging, 500 for a concrete wash. Who did.
**Jdawson**: I'm looking at that engineer's estimate from Fritz.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: They got more extra that I think you could just.
**Jdawson**: Language.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, but up in the pathway part or.
**Speaker 1**: I don't know.
**Speaker 1**: You can share your screen.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Because I don't know if this is applicable to that of it all.
**Speaker 1**: So.
**Jdawson**: See these two items up here.
**Speaker 1**: Related to.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I see what you're saying.
**Jdawson**: Because, I mean, the city guy is not going to really know the difference.
**Speaker 1**: jdawson.
**Jdawson**: I hope he keeps this email.
**Speaker 1**: Who's that?
**Jdawson**: That's a really good.
**Jdawson**: I said I hope he keeps this email.
**Jdawson**: That's a really good way to break this down for him to understand it.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And I did connect with the job planner lady.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, what'd she say?
**Jdawson**: I just touched base with her to make sure she was the one I should be going to.
**Jdawson**: And she said yes.
**Jdawson**: And then I sent her the pay app questions and I haven't heard back on them yet.
**Jdawson**: And then Andrew's going to help me with a little punch this test, and I'll get going on that, too.
**Jdawson**: But I want to get that PSR this SOP out this week.
**Jdawson**: It's kind of important to hit this get out right away, and then I'll send it to you for a quick check before it gets issued.
**Jdawson**: Do we have a process for that to issue those things or just email them out to everybody?
**Speaker 1**: For issuing like SOPs.
**Speaker 1**: Ah.
**Speaker 1**: We just look at it.
**Speaker 1**: You make a look at it.
**Speaker 1**: If we like it, we'll issue it.
**Jdawson**: Okay, cool.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Because there's a few other things I want to get out to them like issuing the look ahead schedules with the weekly reports.
**Jdawson**: Is there any reason you wouldn't want those as a combined document?
**Speaker 1**: The weekly reports with what else?
**Jdawson**: Either a three or a six week look ahead, depending on the project.
**Speaker 1**: They were saying, I don't know, someone was looking at how to export like a look ahead from Microsoft project.
**Speaker 1**: I don't know how to do it, but if they can, great.
**Speaker 1**: Or if they need to do a just an Excel.
**Speaker 1**: You know, there's one thing Alex did do is give a look at schedule with this report for two weeks.
**Speaker 1**: So.
**Speaker 1**: And it's good for just making the superintendents at least acknowledge they're looking ahead.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Update that every two.
**Speaker 1**: Every week.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I just that.
**Jdawson**: Because I've seen one come through that had it just attached to the PDF of the weekly report.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So I figured that's the best way to do it.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, for sure.
**Jdawson**: And you, you can export that stuff in PDF.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Put it in there.
**Speaker 1**: Like it?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I'm kind of viewing that as kind of a separate thing.
**Jdawson**: But be in the same email.
**Jdawson**: I'm just going to send out a big old instructional probably.
**Jdawson**: But I'll talk through everything with you first.
**Jdawson**: Because they're also like on Westfield, they're taking pictures every week to coincide with the look ahead.
**Speaker 1**: Yep.
**Speaker 1**: I mean when I'd send my weekly reports out, you know, if I mention what I did that week, it's a good idea to put a picture of that in there.
**Speaker 1**: Yes.
**Speaker 1**: You know, some of these it's like, well, Jack's notorious because he evidently doesn't like taking photos and he just doesn't have anything to put in there.
**Speaker 1**: It's like some weeks to be like, okay, I've seen the inside wall of the sales floor ten times now.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: I don't need to see that anymore.
**Speaker 1**: Like what other interesting thing new is there?
**Jdawson**: He needs to learn how to tell the story of what's going on with his phone camera.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So did you kind of outline that in your SOP?
**Speaker 1**: Like, hey, when you're.
**Speaker 1**: Or you.
**Speaker 1**: That's what you'll put in there when it comes to.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, that'll.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that'll be part of that.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Because I want to break into a little detail of the shift related.
**Jdawson**: Since it's already being issued in a document.
**Jdawson**: So like the look ahead.
**Jdawson**: Photos are great because we can go on anytime and kind of see, like.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that aligns with the schedule, so that shit's legit.
**Jdawson**: We can kind of foresee problems.
**Jdawson**: And then the regular pictures for the.
**Jdawson**: Just the weekly site pictures.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that should be very detailed.
**Jdawson**: And he's walking around all the time anyway.
**Speaker 1**: Yep.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: I mean, back in the day, had a camera and I have to go download the photos, and then I still do.
**Jdawson**: I still do it that way.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, really?
**Speaker 1**: Now?
**Speaker 1**: Now?
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, just phone with the app.
**Speaker 1**: You take them right in the job planner app, and there they are.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that part's cool.
**Jdawson**: I'm.
**Jdawson**: I'm still old school with putting them into the OneDrive.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, yeah.
**Jdawson**: But I'm just so used to having an extra.
**Jdawson**: A separate camera for it with the memory card.
**Jdawson**: I can just pop it in the reader and there they are.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Still takes.
**Speaker 1**: It's time consuming.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: The online platform is.
**Jdawson**: That's nice.
**Jdawson**: And that.
**Jdawson**: I'll work with that job planner lady to dial in the stuff that they know we need to get dialed in.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I got the meeting with Kevin Mike right now.
**Speaker 1**: All right.
**Speaker 1**: All right, I'll talk with you later.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: Thanks, Jesse.
**Speaker 1**: Thank you.
**Speaker 1**: See you.
**Speaker 1**: jdawson.
