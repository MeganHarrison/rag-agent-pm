## Transcript
**Jdawson**: Then hello.
**Jdawson**: I think it works.
**Bclymer**: And more detail.
**Jdawson**: So Brandon will be able to make it.
**Bclymer**: And then you want to start slowly towards.
**Kmass**: Hey, Brandon's not going to be able to make it.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Kmass**: Is it Joe or Joseph?
**Jdawson**: Joe's fine.
**Jdawson**: You guys.
**Jdawson**: Okay, let me write.
**Jdawson**: Let me see what notes.
**Jdawson**: I've marked this for an hour.
**Jdawson**: It shouldn't take an hour.
**Jdawson**: I just wanted to make sure that we had a conversation regarding the.
**Jdawson**: What you have to do.
**Jdawson**: Actually, I don't even know if it's scheduled.
**Jdawson**: Is it scheduled for tomorrow yet?
**Kmass**: Yeah, tomorrow at 5:30.
**Jdawson**: Oh, at 5:30.
**Jdawson**: Oh, I see that now.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Why it's so late, so.
**Jdawson**: So ideally we are looking forward.
**Jdawson**: Well, tomorrow at 5:30 is the normal call that has TPC, TPG and everything on it.
**Jdawson**: But.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Kmass**: They wanted to have it then, so.
**Jdawson**: They wanted to have it during that.
**Jdawson**: That's fine.
**Bclymer**: Any other question?
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: I kind of sent over a lot of the stuff that, that we had that you asked for last week from the exotech side.
**Jdawson**: We don't really have a lot of the information until we get closer to being on site.
**Jdawson**: But what do y' all.
**Jdawson**: Do you have slides all ready or can you share your screen?
**Kmass**: Kev will share his screen.
**Kmass**: I'll show you.
**Kmass**: He'll show you the PowerPoint they have so far.
**Kmass**: And then anything you want to add or include on there, we can put it in there.
**Bclymer**: And do we need to set.
**Bclymer**: So this is what we have put together, the basic scope of the project.
**Bclymer**: And they were asking for logistic maps.
**Bclymer**: And we put it together here where we would be parking and where we are installing our fence and where spaces that we are using to store material and accessing the site.
**Jdawson**: This slide here, not 100% sure this is right.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we originally had the fence going all the way down on that right side.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Speaker 3**: But you know, like Brandon mentioned to us, you know, we're going to need.
**Jdawson**: We're going to be having a lot of racking and piping coming, coming from that ramp down there.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So just so you're aware, you can't.
**Jdawson**: You're not going to be able to fence off this because all this area, you.
**Jdawson**: You have to make that fence go straight down because all of that area right there on the right is what they call the GU area, which is another product that they sell.
**Jdawson**: This whole area below it, I mean, I know you guys are gonna have piping and we're gonna have racking and we're gonna have everything, but each one of these squares Is, is.
**Jdawson**: I mean it's a big area, right?
**Jdawson**: But yeah, they, we.
**Jdawson**: We can't use this area over here where your cursor is.
**Jdawson**: That's, that's actually has production.
**Kmass**: Who Canon or who said to move the fence?
**Kmass**: Was anyone from or that just something you guys did?
**Bclymer**: It's Brandon.
**Speaker 3**: Internal conversation.
**Speaker 3**: Does that mean we won't, will not have access to that loading ramp?
**Speaker 3**: Bottom right corner?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: No, no, no, no.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so let me show you something.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, I can, I can mark this up and change it.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we definitely need to change it.
**Jdawson**: So here's kind of something that I sent to Brandon not too long ago.
**Jdawson**: See how it has the gu area here?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So again, this is, this is another product of theirs that they unload and load out through these docking doors out here.
**Jdawson**: They moved their sublease area, which is this fence that you see here, and kind of shrunk their gu area which originally they had coming across all the way.
**Jdawson**: So for our sake, you know, when we start, you know we're going to start and just have our rack beyond where the, the next rafting is going to go and then eventually move everything south.
**Jdawson**: So we're going to actually unload everything.
**Jdawson**: They asked us to unload everything from the north gates because this goes all the way up.
**Jdawson**: Actually this isn't completely accurate, but this, you're going to be closed off with the north gates.
**Jdawson**: And they want a fence that cuts off this bottom piece as well so that people can walk from this area across to this area.
**Jdawson**: Now what I said to the customer last week is if they're only going to give us a 10 foot clearance from here to here, once this first rack goes up, we're gonna have to start going from the south gate.
**Jdawson**: So that was discussed with Brandon to have kind of a, I don't know what it is, maybe a 10 foot or 8 foot open swing door that they can, that we can open, unload and then close it back up so that this area is pretty much sealed off from the rest of the area because you can't cut it off from here all the way down here or else people would have to walk through the area to get from one side to the other.
**Jdawson**: So to start the project, they want everything coming from the north.
**Jdawson**: And then I told them once we get that first rack up on that second one on this Skypod, we're going to have to start unloading from the south gate.
**Speaker 3**: Okay.
**Speaker 3**: So it sounds like our original layout is kind of what we want to probably go after.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**Speaker 3**: But There is no ramp door leading into the warehouse.
**Jdawson**: No.
**Kmass**: They're going to have just like they're going to have just back up to a loading dock and unload it, unfortunately.
**Jdawson**: How can.
**Speaker 4**: Joe, aren't you bringing that in on a flatbed?
**Speaker 4**: How are you going to unload that?
**Jdawson**: Unload what?
**Jdawson**: They.
**Jdawson**: It's coming off of a truck.
**Jdawson**: They just.
**Jdawson**: You're racking your.
**Speaker 4**: Your racks.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, they're just going to pull them straight off the truck.
**Speaker 4**: Yeah, but it's a flatbed, isn't it?
**Speaker 4**: I mean usually that comes in a flatbed.
**Speaker 4**: You got to take it from the side.
**Jdawson**: They pull all the sites I've been on, they pull it straight out the back.
**Jdawson**: Just let the pork.
**Jdawson**: They put that.
**Jdawson**: Someone's got to get in it.
**Jdawson**: They wrap the straps around the back and they pull everything straight out.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Even at the last one at Pepsi they had to put down like a sliding mats so they can slide it across the floor once they pull it in.
**Speaker 4**: Yeah, every time I've seen it, you know, it's which, you know, whatever.
**Speaker 4**: They always pull in a flatbed and then take the forks, lift it up and from the side and then truck it over.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I haven't seen that.
**Jdawson**: If they do do that some.
**Jdawson**: I don't know that maybe that's what Sky Pod 1.
**Jdawson**: I don't know.
**Speaker 4**: Yeah, these are all ice.
**Speaker 4**: Sky Pod 1.
**Jdawson**: All the trucks that I've seen them, they.
**Jdawson**: They pull it straight out the bed.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 4**: Our spark pipe still needs to have the truck all the way in there.
**Kmass**: Well, there's no way to get to it.
**Kmass**: This gu area is up and running.
**Kmass**: So we can't.
**Speaker 4**: It's got.
**Speaker 4**: That gu area's got stuff in it.
**Kmass**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: Yes.
**Speaker 4**: Yeah.
**Speaker 4**: But I mean, I mean this bay is what, 50ft like this, this first bay, the speed bay here from the first column line.
**Speaker 4**: So racking piping access.
**Speaker 4**: Right.
**Speaker 4**: I mean we.
**Speaker 4**: That's our pipes only 24 foot sticks.
**Speaker 4**: So that.
**Speaker 4**: That speed bay is probably 50ft.
**Speaker 4**: Who have the.
**Speaker 4**: The architectural drawing.
**Jdawson**: I mean that, that's why he showed it the way.
**Jdawson**: The way it was.
**Jdawson**: Brandon, he has it to where it's supposed to be cut off here and then have a little gate here because he knows eventually we will have to unload from this south gate.
**Jdawson**: But this is a operational area here with racks and you know where they.
**Jdawson**: So then yeah, we just ship it.
**Speaker 4**: We'll just keep our fence over where.
**Speaker 4**: Where it was pulled all the way down and then we'll have to obviously unload there and Fork, truck it over.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: If you go to next.
**Jdawson**: So let's change if you guys want to get back to sharing.
**Kmass**: Keep going, Keep going.
**Speaker 4**: Yeah, you can pull a measurement, but that's, that's probably 50ft right there.
**Jdawson**: Zoom in.
**Kmass**: Like where, like what is the system they have in there?
**Kmass**: How far does all that going.
**Speaker 4**: It doesn't go past that.
**Speaker 4**: It doesn't go past the speed bay.
**Speaker 4**: So the first, the first line of columns is called the speed base where the docks are at.
**Speaker 4**: No racking will ever be in there.
**Speaker 4**: So you just, just calibrate that.
**Speaker 4**: Well, actually probably he's got scale in there, but yeah, that's going to be, it's going to be 50ft.
**Jdawson**: No, I'm saying.
**Kmass**: Joe, back to the, like what's in what is over there?
**Kmass**: Can we go back to that?
**Kmass**: Where's the other drawing?
**Jdawson**: What is over where.
**Jdawson**: What do you mean.
**Kmass**: We go back to that drawing?
**Kmass**: Our logistics plan.
**Kmass**: Or is it.
**Kmass**: Or the drawing you were sharing, Joe.
**Kmass**: I guess that had the, their systems.
**Kmass**: Can you share your screen?
**Kmass**: Okay, so if we zoom into that bottom area.
**Kmass**: So they have, so everything that they use is from that.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So basically there's, there's a ton of racking.
**Jdawson**: They've moved stuff around and they're still moving things.
**Jdawson**: But all of this, like there's a bunch of stations right here.
**Jdawson**: All of these stations behind the little green has been moved over to the right.
**Jdawson**: I mean, you just, you, this area right here just has to be treated as, you know.
**Jdawson**: Yes, you can, we can maneuver if you needed to bring a few things like across.
**Jdawson**: But I wouldn't, I wouldn't try to bring all your piping in through there like by any means.
**Jdawson**: Now if you had to bring in some big lifts or something like that, of course.
**Jdawson**: Okay, but they use area, they use.
**Kmass**: All them dock doors to move the product out from that.
**Jdawson**: Correct.
**Jdawson**: We're, we're only going to be able to use these dock doors because this actually, this actually should probably go all the way up like this.
**Jdawson**: Go all the way up to this.
**Jdawson**: And this should actually be up like this.
**Jdawson**: This is just a rough that I put together.
**Jdawson**: This is for my own sake of installation schedule.
**Jdawson**: So don't take this as the accurate depiction of anything, but this is kind of just showing.
**Jdawson**: We, we will be unloading from the north gate to start.
**Jdawson**: And then once we start on Skypod B, we will be coming in like I said, around November.
**Jdawson**: We'll have to start unloading everything from the south.
**Jdawson**: But.
**Kmass**: Okay, so then we'll add Two.
**Kmass**: So.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, because originally they weren't even going to give us this area either.
**Jdawson**: They were going to make us go all the way over.
**Jdawson**: But we, we had to have that switched.
**Jdawson**: Like, I mean, these squares.
**Jdawson**: How big are these squares?
**Jdawson**: I can't, for some reason, I can't.
**Kmass**: 50 plus feet.
**Jdawson**: They're about.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I think they're.
**Kmass**: So 55 foot columns.
**Jdawson**: So to be honest, we should have plenty of room to lay down.
**Kmass**: Okay, so then on our logistics plan, we'll go back to that.
**Kmass**: We'll have, you know, access to loading dock.
**Kmass**: We'll be able to use the top and the bottom at some point.
**Kmass**: So we'll add these doors here with the red up here.
**Bclymer**: I'm going to share really quick so you can.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so here you say we can have access to bottom and top here.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, the top to start.
**Jdawson**: They're going to request that everything comes in on the top to start.
**Jdawson**: And once it's, you know, absolutely necessary to start going from the bottom, we can start going from the bottom.
**Kmass**: Okay, that's just because their people are going to be going back and forth all the time.
**Jdawson**: Correct.
**Jdawson**: And that's because they had.
**Jdawson**: They have to get from one side of the warehouse to the other.
**Jdawson**: So they want it, they want to, they want to kind of keep it closed off to where they can't get into our area.
**Jdawson**: And we don't access their area either.
**Speaker 3**: Okay, so one thing, Joe.
**Speaker 3**: The south bathroom in our original logistics plan, that is outside of the working area.
**Speaker 3**: Now that is where the plumbing is going to be happening.
**Jdawson**: Correct.
**Speaker 3**: So other than where we shut that bathroom down once we have the plumbers mobilized, or is that something that we can get offline earlier?
**Speaker 3**: Is that something they need at all times?
**Jdawson**: I think that's something that we need to discuss with Uniglo because in this area where you have it, say fence to be installed from column, this is a giant duku system.
**Jdawson**: And I believe that restroom is for all the workers there.
**Jdawson**: So I think if there is timeline in the schedule, which it looks like you got a schedule on slide five that we did that has to be properly planned with the customer to say, hey, you're not gonna have access to this bathroom during, you know, from X to X.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Kmass**: All we're doing is we're just cutting into the lift station that's there and then cut.
**Kmass**: Tapping into the vent piping.
**Kmass**: It's not like it's going to be down for more than a day or a few hours, if that's fine.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, but yeah, definitely get Your fencing corrected on here.
**Kmass**: If you go back to the architect.
**Kmass**: Kevin, pull up the architectural set.
**Kmass**: Here's the fence.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, There you go.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: I'm just saying because that line, the line that you're showing on the other.
**Jdawson**: On the slide.
**Speaker 3**: Kevin, do you have the original logistics plan?
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: Should be in there.
**Speaker 3**: That kind of shows the majority of what we've been talking about as far as what's.
**Jdawson**: What's.
**Jdawson**: What.
**Bclymer**: So this is.
**Kmass**: Go back to the folder.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: So this.
**Speaker 3**: This, I think, falls in line kind of with what we've all been just.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, there we go.
**Jdawson**: There we go.
**Speaker 3**: By the sounds of it, we need to keep it as is in this drawing.
**Speaker 3**: And then we'll just need to coordinate the south bathroom when that's scheduled ahead of time.
**Speaker 3**: And then as far as the dock doors, like you said, the north is where we're going to go first until we get asked not to.
**Speaker 3**: And then we'll move to the south.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: This is the exact drawing that.
**Speaker 3**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: That needs to be det.
**Jdawson**: Depicted on that slide.
**Speaker 3**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Speaker 3**: So what we'll do is we'll.
**Speaker 3**: Guys, we just got to go through it and get all the extra verbiage and whatnot out of it.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: Joe, you don't see any issue with the parking being moved up there to.
**Jdawson**: The north, do you?
**Jdawson**: No, they.
**Jdawson**: They have a huge fac.
**Jdawson**: I mean, it's a huge facility that all the times I've been up there, I don't even.
**Jdawson**: Honestly, most of the.
**Jdawson**: I don't see too many trucks being going in and out anyways.
**Jdawson**: I think.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, all that.
**Jdawson**: All that's going to be fine.
**Jdawson**: It's.
**Jdawson**: They got a lot of room out there.
**Jdawson**: Put it that way.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Kmass**: All right, what's our next slide here?
**Kmass**: Well, so.
**Bclymer**: So this would obviously change and you.
**Kmass**: Know, life safety, like the left is just showing going through, you know, you know, this will be open up here, but they'll be coming through our gate on that other drawing.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Kmass**: They need to come out this way.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And then I would change the wording.
**Jdawson**: They're.
**Kmass**: It's.
**Jdawson**: They might.
**Jdawson**: It might get brought up.
**Jdawson**: It's not that big of a deal.
**Jdawson**: Go back up that area on the top right.
**Jdawson**: Restricted areas that says area occupied by Uniqlo.
**Jdawson**: You could just.
**Jdawson**: You could just put restricted area or something.
**Jdawson**: It's actually not Uniqlo that has that area.
**Jdawson**: That fenced off area is a subleased area.
**Jdawson**: So you can even just put least area or something.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Everything on the left.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: Is occupied by uniform.
**Kmass**: I Just.
**Kmass**: We'll call it restricted everything on the.
**Jdawson**: That's fine.
**Kmass**: Left.
**Kmass**: Yeah.
**Kmass**: Okay, so then maybe we want to add two on us.
**Kmass**: We'll add another sign and just put restricted area inside of our fence.
**Kmass**: Anything going out to the right of the left.
**Jdawson**: So any weekend work.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: Has to be coordinated.
**Jdawson**: 6am to 6pm doing 12 hours.
**Jdawson**: Look at something.
**Jdawson**: All right, so just so y' all know, we generally do 7am to 5pm until we start falling behind.
**Jdawson**: If we start falling behind, we'll either get more crew or do weekend.
**Jdawson**: Or extending the course because I don't think they have somebody there until like 6:30am Which I think was set on the last call.
**Kmass**: I thought.
**Kmass**: I don't get all the calls, but I thought the guy said he would.
**Kmass**: He gets there like 5:30 in the morning.
**Kmass**: And we just said some of our guys may not show up.
**Kmass**: You know, they may show up as early as six.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Kmass**: We just put it on there.
**Jdawson**: Just keep it on there just to see what they say.
**Jdawson**: Construction signs.
**Jdawson**: That's fine.
**Jdawson**: Shut down dates.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Key contacts.
**Jdawson**: Perfect.
**Kmass**: You have an emergency contact you want us to put in there for you?
**Jdawson**: I.
**Jdawson**: I don't even know who.
**Jdawson**: Who it would be.
**Jdawson**: It would.
**Kmass**: It would pick someone you work with.
**Kmass**: You don't like, pick their cell phone on there.
**Bclymer**: It.
**Jdawson**: It would probably.
**Jdawson**: The installation manager would probably be the emergency contact as well because he, he's actually the manager over all the site supervisors.
**Jdawson**: So I don't know if he.
**Jdawson**: Instead of emergency contact, maybe if you want to put site super supervisor and then just put tbd.
**Bclymer**: Okay, okay.
**Jdawson**: Because that will be the emergency contact as well.
**Jdawson**: They'll be the person that's on site all the time.
**Jdawson**: I don't know if you wanted to put Sean's email in there.
**Jdawson**: You kind of have a blank there.
**Jdawson**: It's just Sean.McKnight Exotech.com is that s.
**Kmass**: E A N or S H A?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, you got it spelled right.
**Jdawson**: Right there.
**Jdawson**: It's just his first last name.
**Kmass**: Oh yeah.
**Jdawson**: You guys a barbecue?
**Speaker 4**: That application college.
**Speaker 4**: Yes or no?
**Kmass**: Good barbecue.
**Jdawson**: I love it.
**Speaker 4**: Okay, then I'll order.
**Kmass**: Yeah.
**Speaker 4**: I just asked you, like, what do you want to do with the rest of your life?
**Kmass**: Let's try to eat healthy this week.
**Jdawson**: And you gotta like bring up barbecue.
**Speaker 4**: Barbecue is something.
**Kmass**: It's protein.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, right.
**Speaker 4**: Still drown it in sugary sauce.
**Kmass**: Well then it's no good.
**Speaker 4**: I'll get you a salad if you want.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Kmass**: So then you put here site.
**Kmass**: You said site supervisor or.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, just Put site supervisor or you can put on site supervisor and then site supervisor and tbd.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Kmass**: Where you at?
**Kmass**: Emergency contact.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Because they will be the.
**Jdawson**: They will be the emergency contact for anything.
**Kmass**: So then here's our schedule.
**Kmass**: I guess you've looked at this and coordinated with Brandon all these dates for what you're planning on.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I think, I think he put these.
**Jdawson**: He got these dates based on the plan that we have as of right now.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: I think on Friday we made one change and it is the install date for the fence.
**Jdawson**: So let me make a note of that from my side.
**Speaker 3**: Now, that's still tentative.
**Speaker 3**: We're still waiting on a confirmation from them, but they said it should, should be there by Wednesday.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, and that's fine.
**Jdawson**: I just want to make sure that when we're both sharing schedules that we, we are aligned.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: I mean, if this is the same thing, it doesn't bother me.
**Jdawson**: Schedule is the schedule.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Boom, boom, boom.
**Jdawson**: Go live 7:31.
**Kmass**: So is the fast retailing.
**Kmass**: Is that your signal symbol?
**Jdawson**: If you can make the go live 84.
**Jdawson**: Is that Monday?
**Jdawson**: 8 4, 26, 83.
**Jdawson**: Sorry, 8 3.
**Jdawson**: Yes, that's the question too.
**Jdawson**: Is aliate will be demobilizing before the Go Live.
**Jdawson**: I don't, I don't see any reason that y' all would be needed to be out there.
**Jdawson**: But.
**Kmass**: May we demobilize?
**Kmass**: Because if it's, you know, a month or two months before you're doing your Go live, we can send back whoever's needed for the electrician and our super to be there for that.
**Jdawson**: That's fine.
**Jdawson**: You shouldn't have any scope by this point anyways.
**Jdawson**: Right after the final inspection, you're kind of, you know, you're done.
**Jdawson**: It's more, you know, closing up, the closing up any permits or anything like that.
**Jdawson**: But as far as I know, I wouldn't think that there's anything really needed unless something catastrophic kind of happens.
**Jdawson**: And the Go Live date is.
**Jdawson**: Yes, that's the beginning.
**Jdawson**: They call it provisional here.
**Jdawson**: It's basically the start of the ramp up.
**Jdawson**: So provisional will be on August 3rd.
**Jdawson**: And then the actual Go Live, our final acceptance is, I believe, 30 days later.
**Jdawson**: I don't have a schedule for me, but I think.
**Jdawson**: What else you got?
**Jdawson**: What's the next one?
**Jdawson**: Weekly construction updates, Weekly structure, call day time.
**Jdawson**: Okay, perfect.
**Jdawson**: Perfect.
**Bclymer**: There's the last slide.
**Jdawson**: Workers exotech.
**Jdawson**: Now this all looks good.
**Jdawson**: Let me run through this email that they sent about this.
**Jdawson**: To start, I think, I think this answers and gives them Clarity on a lot of their.
**Jdawson**: Just make sure.
**Kmass**: This monthly manpower law, I'm guessing that's the peak number of workers on any given day.
**Jdawson**: Yes, yes.
**Kmass**: So you might want to clarify that.
**Jdawson**: This.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, this is just an.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, just clarify.
**Jdawson**: This is just an example.
**Jdawson**: It's not always going to be exotic.
**Jdawson**: 25 people on site.
**Jdawson**: That's just at the peak, of course, which will pretty much be during, during the rack install phase.
**Jdawson**: Once the rack is done, basically 12 people come off site.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Presenting area work, construction restrictions.
**Jdawson**: Defining construction, working hours, construction signage, defining timeline.
**Jdawson**: That's fine.
**Jdawson**: Firm parking.
**Jdawson**: Good, good, good.
**Jdawson**: Escape route egress, define building shutdowns, potential dates, site pm, site server, emergency contact.
**Jdawson**: I guess that's one of the things.
**Jdawson**: I don't know why they keep writing this on here.
**Jdawson**: How many forklifts are y' all bringing in?
**Jdawson**: I guess that's kind of.
**Jdawson**: I don't know why they're.
**Jdawson**: They're so worried about it.
**Jdawson**: But how many do you think you'll have on site?
**Jdawson**: I guess they want to know total, how many of everything is going to be out there?
**Kmass**: I would say two probably max.
**Jdawson**: So you'll have two regular size forklifts or forklifts.
**Jdawson**: What about jack?
**Jdawson**: What about scissor lifts?
**Kmass**: I would imagine maybe six, eight max.
**Kmass**: And the electricians, fire sprinker guys.
**Jdawson**: I would put that somewhere in here and kind of put, maybe put it under the manpower one or something, equipment.
**Jdawson**: And then I put like how many are you going to start with?
**Jdawson**: You know, because obviously you're not going to just send eight out of there.
**Jdawson**: Maybe put how many you're going to have from now until August.
**Jdawson**: And then once the racking starts, how many you plan on having it there?
**Jdawson**: I think that'll be.
**Kmass**: Are you typically just going to run cords across the floor to charge your lifts or do we need to have a charging station basically where all lifts go?
**Jdawson**: That's something we need to ask the customer on what they want us to do.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: You can put that as one of these points here and then have a question because not only are you going to have lifts out there, of course my, my team's going to have lifts out there.
**Jdawson**: The install team's going to have lifts out there.
**Jdawson**: So gonna.
**Jdawson**: We'll probably be taking up quite a bit of space on just, just forklifts and scissor lifts.
**Speaker 3**: Question for you, Joe.
**Speaker 3**: Once you guys start, let's say you have a racking system all the way up the aisles that you're going to be going up and down Are you guys having your charge rail on the floor or anything like that?
**Speaker 3**: That requires a special lift as far as entering and exiting fully installed racks.
**Jdawson**: Correct.
**Jdawson**: So I was going over that with Brandon the other week.
**Jdawson**: We generally do have a special lift that we call the Sky Lift that is manufactured just to fit in between the bracking.
**Jdawson**: Unfortunately, the manufacturing of that is delayed until 2026.
**Jdawson**: Right now I'm being told January, but I would not hold that date firm by any means.
**Jdawson**: So what we're going to do is we're going to bring out two of the genie.
**Jdawson**: Is like.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, I saw that.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, the really small genie ones, they're, they're a pain in the butt to deal with.
**Jdawson**: They really are.
**Jdawson**: That's why I kind of had a conversation with Brandon and my site, the guy Sean that's listed there the other day on how they were doing it at other sites on how the sprinkler people were able to manage it.
**Jdawson**: And, you know, we might just have to get creative with some things, but the, they've managed to do it on other sites.
**Jdawson**: It sounds like they, they fully, you know, install all the sprinkler heads on the pipe and then kind of turn it sideways and feed it through and then turn it upright and install it so they don't have to go back in the middle.
**Jdawson**: And I think.
**Jdawson**: Gotcha.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, tighten anything up.
**Jdawson**: But it might be a moving target.
**Jdawson**: But yeah, the more we can.
**Jdawson**: The more you don't have to go in between right after it's up.
**Jdawson**: It's going to be for the, the best for everybody, because those, they will have them on site, those little genies, but they, they don't.
**Jdawson**: You have to like manually move them.
**Speaker 3**: Gotcha.
**Speaker 3**: Okay, understood.
**Speaker 3**: Do we think they're going to want.
**Jdawson**: To know where these, where our lifts are stored?
**Jdawson**: They might, they might.
**Jdawson**: And I, for the, for the moment, I'd probably tell them that's, that's a tough question because you want to, yeah, you want to pull that up because you don't want to, you don't, you don't want to put all the lifts on the south side because you're going to be offloading everything from the north.
**Jdawson**: I mean, to be honest, it's, it's going to be a moving target because we are going to be moving the staging area and we'll obviously be moving, you know, where we lay down stuff as we go.
**Jdawson**: But any, anything that can be, you know, that isn't used daily, definitely just as far away as possible in the bottom right corner.
**Jdawson**: I would think.
**Jdawson**: But then yeah, it's like hey, how much power can you.
**Jdawson**: Can you just use a regular outlet or do we need like some special things in order to charge these lifts?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I think most columns have power on them but I haven't really surveyed the area to.
**Jdawson**: To go into that kind of detail.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Good question though.
**Kmass**: We will get this updated, they'll shoot you a copy of it and then we got all tomorrow to make any other changes if there's something else you see.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, no, other than this.
**Jdawson**: I think you answered pretty much every one of their points here on their.
**Jdawson**: Their.
**Jdawson**: So I think think this presentation should be good.
**Jdawson**: Like I said, it doesn't.
**Jdawson**: It needs to be detailed enough to not ask too many more questions but also not give enough that we'll stick our foots in our mouth later.
**Jdawson**: So we don't want to.
**Jdawson**: We.
**Jdawson**: You know, it's.
**Jdawson**: They're very.
**Jdawson**: Just to let you know, they are very, very.
**Jdawson**: They're going to ask very specific questions and really explaining hey, it's, you know, there are some things that you just, you kind of figure out when you get out there and that's very, it's that to.
**Jdawson**: To their culture that's, that's very hard to understand.
**Jdawson**: They want a plan, you know, when are you going to screw this in what.
**Jdawson**: You know, and it's like hey, we just gotta, you know, we'll have some people out there.
**Jdawson**: They're going to be figuring this out as they're out there.
**Jdawson**: There are things that are going to move, you know.
**Jdawson**: And I have to explain to them several, several times that I'm putting a plan together.
**Jdawson**: Alato and exotech.
**Jdawson**: But things are going, you know, to be adjusted as we go along.
**Jdawson**: So it's, there's always going to be a lot of explaining.
**Jdawson**: It is going to be difficult in that sense.
**Jdawson**: But just know that it's, it's.
**Jdawson**: It's just the way they are and if we have to give them initial dates and then move it, that's fine.
**Jdawson**: But they, they might ask for more detail than we're ready to give.
**Jdawson**: And it's, it's something I've been, you know, I've been working on with them since, since we started.
**Jdawson**: So it's nothing new and we'll get there.
**Jdawson**: But I think this looks good, think we'll be good for tomorrow and we can hopefully.
**Jdawson**: I'm actually trying to get in touch with the floor remediation people right now so I'll hopefully have something, some information to give them as well.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Kmass**: Sounds good.
**Jdawson**: Cool.
**Kmass**: I appreciate it.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: Thanks, y' all.
**Kmass**: Thanks.
**Bclymer**: Thank you.
**Kmass**: See you.
**Jdawson**: That.
