## Transcript
**Bclymer**: Actually structural.
**Bclymer**: They're concrete in there.
**Jremillard**: Really?
**Kdannwolf**: Dang.
**Jremillard**: So they formed and poured the concrete inside of the panel?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, it's kind of a hexagon shape on the inside.
**Jremillard**: Who is the contractor that made those?
**Bclymer**: Moss.
**Bclymer**: Moss is the general contractor, and cap form is the shell contractor.
**Kdannwolf**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: It's a tiny little building.
**Bclymer**: The floor plate's about 8,500 square feet.
**Bclymer**: And the units divided down the long axis of the building.
**Bclymer**: There's either two units of floor or one unit of floor, depending on what the buyer opts for.
**Bclymer**: It's about 85% sold.
**Bclymer**: And I think almost half the floors are.
**Bclymer**: People bought the whole floor of it.
**Bclymer**: You can't see from the image, but it's got water on both the side closest to me and opposite side of the building.
**Bclymer**: So it's one of the few locations in Miami where you get water on two sides.
**Bclymer**: So it's kind of.
**Bclymer**: Kind of a neat location.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Kdannwolf**: Cool.
**Jremillard**: It's like, interesting.
**Jremillard**: Buildings are interesting.
**Bclymer**: It's in a part of Miami.
**Bclymer**: You could have bought the entire block for, you know, 10 grand.
**Bclymer**: When I got down here at 99, you wouldn't go out.
**Bclymer**: You wouldn't go into that area if you weren't armed in 99.
**Bclymer**: And now it's full of multimillion dollar condos.
**Bclymer**: It's wild how the city's changed.
**Dfattal**: Kurt used to tell us stories about when he was building the Four Seasons.
**Dfattal**: There'd just be chickens on site, just running around.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, chickens on Brickell Avenue.
**Bclymer**: Showing my age.
**Dfattal**: What's up, everybody?
**Jremillard**: How you doing?
**Dfattal**: Danny?
**Dfattal**: Good to see you.
**Dfattal**: Jesse and Jesse.
**Kdannwolf**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: J.D.
**Speaker 4**: Can you guys hear me now?
**Kdannwolf**: Yeah.
**Kdannwolf**: Okay.
**Kdannwolf**: Internet.
**Dfattal**: Where's the doggo?
**Speaker 4**: Oh, I left him at home today because I had to run some errands and.
**Dfattal**: No, I just.
**Dfattal**: I just see the dog bed in the back, and there's nobody in there.
**Dfattal**: So I was like, what happened to the dog?
**Speaker 4**: So it's just for looks, you know, in case a chick calls.
**Speaker 4**: You know, I can look like that guy.
**Kdannwolf**: Yeah, There you go.
**Jremillard**: What's funny is we had this meeting with this lady that wanted to build a dog park, and she.
**Jremillard**: She asked Brandon, is that a cat lady?
**Speaker 4**: That is a killer.
**Kdannwolf**: Okay.
**Speaker 4**: Because I possum yesterday.
**Speaker 4**: Another one last week.
**Speaker 4**: Guy's got blood on his mouth.
**Kdannwolf**: He's.
**Kdannwolf**: That's hilarious.
**Kdannwolf**: All right.
**Dfattal**: You guys want to get ready to get.
**Dfattal**: Can we get started?
**Kdannwolf**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: I think, Brandon, you froze up again.
**Kdannwolf**: Oh.
**Speaker 4**: I don't know what's going on with our Internet.
**Speaker 4**: It keeps going in and out here.
**Speaker 4**: So if I drop.
**Kdannwolf**: Oops.
**Dfattal**: Well, I was curious to see what happens if.
**Dfattal**: If he drops out.
**Dfattal**: He never really got a chance to mention that.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I think he just might have.
**Jremillard**: When I'm in Indy, I have to, like, shut off my camera or else it just shuts down constantly.
**Speaker 4**: I don't know what's going on with our Internet here.
**Speaker 4**: It keeps cutting in and out.
**Dfattal**: Brandon, maybe just cut out the camera because maybe it's just a lot of bandwidth or whatever.
**Jremillard**: And your face, of course.
**Kdannwolf**: Yeah, that's what it is.
**Dfattal**: What happens when you don't bring the dog in?
**Dfattal**: The Internet stops working.
**Jremillard**: Are you able to hear us?
**Bclymer**: Brandon?
**Dfattal**: He's just having issues.
**Bclymer**: I'd have to call in the old fashioned way.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, really?
**Dfattal**: Let's see if he figures it out.
**Dfattal**: Jesse, are you renting space or is that your apartment?
**Jremillard**: This is our office in St. Pete.
**Kdannwolf**: Oh, nice.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, we've been here for maybe three months now.
**Kdannwolf**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, so it's a real palm tree in the background there.
**Kdannwolf**: Favorite.
**Dfattal**: You know, I love palm trees.
**Kdannwolf**: My hair.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, we basically, like, we got a office administrator starting in August, and then there's three other PMs here now and Camden, or superintendent, so filling up.
**Kdannwolf**: Good.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, Brandon said his Internet's down.
**Jremillard**: See if you want to call in.
**Kdannwolf**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: See if he can get that work figured out.
**Dfattal**: You know, some days I wish we just do the whole call.
**Kdannwolf**: Did you guys hear me?
**Kdannwolf**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Kdannwolf**: There you go.
**Kdannwolf**: All right.
**Speaker 4**: I just called it on my phone.
**Speaker 4**: Like, I don't know what's going on here.
**Speaker 4**: Now this thing will work.
**Speaker 4**: Watch.
**Speaker 4**: All right, cool.
**Speaker 4**: So.
**Speaker 4**: So the biggest thing going through this proposal that we looked at was just, you know, a lot of clarification.
**Speaker 4**: So, you know, the biggest thing is that we weren't sure on, like, we did the math to look at the different buildings and weren't sure what the rhyme or reason or how you guys are taking off.
**Speaker 4**: Is it by construction cost?
**Speaker 4**: Is it by build cost?
**Speaker 4**: Like, it just seemed all over the board, like we couldn't find a, you know, some.
**Speaker 4**: Any.
**Speaker 4**: Anything that told us, you know, how we're coming up with this.
**Bclymer**: So the way I did it, and sorry, if it's.
**Bclymer**: If it is.
**Bclymer**: That's why I included a cost for every building as opposed to just one lump of it.
**Bclymer**: And then per phase.
**Kdannwolf**: So.
**Bclymer**: So it's really just the amount of man hours that go into it that I'm thinking each building is going to take.
**Bclymer**: So some of the buildings between the.
**Bclymer**: The written text and then the.
**Bclymer**: The one on the site plan were different.
**Bclymer**: I think 12 is.
**Kdannwolf**: Is.
**Bclymer**: Could be two different things.
**Bclymer**: But I just, I always went off the site plan just so it was consistent.
**Bclymer**: So 12 in the site plan is like the.
**Bclymer**: The maintenance shop at the, you know, I think it's gonna be the last thing built and that.
**Bclymer**: So if you look at that, that's.
**Bclymer**: There's a very low cost.
**Bclymer**: I'm not envisioning it being, you know, a very elaborate building and then like the pair of buildings at 19, I.
**Bclymer**: From what was there, I gathered they're identical.
**Bclymer**: So there's, you know, a cost to do one and then just a very, you know, ca.
**Bclymer**: Basically to repeat the second one on the site.
**Bclymer**: So that one would be the largest because it's going to, you know, it's 20 stories.
**Bclymer**: It's going to have, you know, it's an apartment building essentially or condo building.
**Bclymer**: So that one had the biggest cost associated with it.
**Bclymer**: And then it kind of went from, you know, like I said, it's all based on man hours.
**Bclymer**: But then it's also what typology of the buildings were.
**Bclymer**: So some of the smaller ones that you have on the site, on the island site, like the hotels and the extended stay timeshare type product, those are typically more elaborate in terms of the finishes and how.
**Bclymer**: That's great.
**Kdannwolf**: Thank you.
**Bclymer**: And how it goes together with various consultants.
**Bclymer**: So you have a pretty heavy ID team, I would think, involved in the hotel, the extended stay, and I think most of the.
**Bclymer**: Besides the parking garage, most of the buildings on the island.
**Bclymer**: So you'll see like the cost per square foot is going to go up, but the construction cost doesn't necessarily matter to us.
**Bclymer**: It's more just the time that my guys are spending on it.
**Bclymer**: So on some of the.
**Bclymer**: More like 11.
**Bclymer**: The elevens, I'm assuming those are kind of repeat buildings.
**Kdannwolf**: Right.
**Bclymer**: And that's.
**Bclymer**: I tried to word that in the description that, you know, they're blocks of five or six, you know, townhomes essentially.
**Bclymer**: And then there's.
**Bclymer**: It seems by the renderings that there's some architectural differences to get them to be the either three, two or one veterans.
**Bclymer**: But there's a note in the description that, you know, hey, for.
**Bclymer**: For clarity's sake, we just use the same, you know, block type in this diagram here just to illustrate what it is.
**Bclymer**: So I put a little bit of time and money in for the variations of those, but not a lot because it's townhomes, I'm envisioning them to kind of be very Modular.
**Bclymer**: And then the same thing with the 9 to 10 A and B, I think it is, you know, all the.
**Bclymer**: All the townhomes in the middle there on the mainland.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, those guys in there.
**Bclymer**: The same thing with those.
**Bclymer**: There's a lot of them.
**Bclymer**: There's a lot of square footage, but I'm not envisioning a lot of differentiation in it.
**Kdannwolf**: Right.
**Bclymer**: We're gonna.
**Bclymer**: We're gonna go in, we're gonna plan out a block of four to five units, and then the facades look like they change a little bit on the.
**Bclymer**: On the renderings for it to provide a little variation in the style.
**Bclymer**: But that's mostly from the kind of.
**Bclymer**: The facade out.
**Bclymer**: What's on the inside is probably gonna be pretty typical between unit types.
**Kdannwolf**: Right.
**Bclymer**: And then so, like, when you're looking at the amount of square footage on some of these, like, those are relatively low dollar items, and I'd be wrong, but that's just, you know, historically, that's how we've seen townhomes versus multifamily stuff.
**Bclymer**: And then a little building, like, you know, what is it, five?
**Bclymer**: It's.
**Bclymer**: It's like the spa and club area.
**Bclymer**: The wellness center, I guess.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: That's another one where I was thinking, you know, just past experience, you're going to have a.
**Bclymer**: There's going to be an ID team involved.
**Bclymer**: There's probably going to be some sort of a chef involved with the restaurant.
**Bclymer**: There'll be a lot of coordination efforts on that.
**Bclymer**: So the price per square foot on that one crept up as well.
**Bclymer**: I think you can kind of see that reflected in the time.
**Bclymer**: That's why I put the durations in there as well, per phase, because it's.
**Bclymer**: It's, you know, the longer the ones go, the more dollars are attached to it.
**Bclymer**: And that's just kind of how we do proposals.
**Bclymer**: I'm happy to talk about any of them if you want.
**Bclymer**: And just the methodology I came up with for them.
**Speaker 4**: Yeah, I mean, it's the biggest thing was understanding the methodology because we were trying to look at, like, we just didn't understand how you guys did the takeoff.
**Speaker 4**: And so essentially what you're doing is you're just saying, hey, this is going to take, you know, whatever 4,000 man hours for this building and, you know, 2,000 for this one.
**Speaker 4**: Is that correct?
**Kdannwolf**: Yeah.
**Kdannwolf**: Yeah.
**Kdannwolf**: Okay.
**Speaker 4**: And then so looking at this, there was this caveat in there about insurance.
**Speaker 4**: 2.5%.
**Kdannwolf**: What?
**Speaker 4**: Can you go over that?
**Speaker 4**: What exactly is that?
**Speaker 4**: We're adding 2.5% to this number Effectively, yes.
**Bclymer**: And the reason for that is we carry $10 million of insurance and the cost of that to the direct cost to us is 2.5% per do, essentially.
**Speaker 4**: Okay, does that include the.
**Speaker 4**: Because you've got, you know, your, your CM fees in here too.
**Speaker 4**: So you've got 10 million plus another 4.
**Speaker 4**: So is that insurance based off the 10 or the 4?
**Speaker 4**: 14?
**Bclymer**: I believe it's the 14, but I can check for you.
**Speaker 4**: Yeah, if we can confirm that that.
**Bclymer**: Would be, that'd be great.
**Speaker 4**: Because obviously, I mean now in this I would think, I would think, I would think it would be off the 10, but if it's a 14, I, if, if, but yeah.
**Kdannwolf**: Yeah, yeah.
**Speaker 4**: If you can double check that, just let us know.
**Speaker 4**: I'd appreciate it.
**Kdannwolf**: Yeah.
**Speaker 4**: And then so a couple things like, so for instance, like your construction administration, like in that.
**Speaker 4**: So, so, so we own, I own part of this development.
**Speaker 4**: So like there is no need to review the pay app.
**Kdannwolf**: That's fine.
**Speaker 4**: So you know, things like that aren't really going to be needed.
**Speaker 4**: You know, the, the construction observation and travel.
**Speaker 4**: Again, I'm not sure.
**Speaker 4**: You know, I would think that like for the condos and stuff, the third party consultants are the ones that have to sign off on some of that stuff.
**Speaker 4**: You know, Jesse, correct me if I'm wrong, you know, I think typically for you guys when you're traveling to a site, it's typically to certify things are done and you know, sign off on payment.
**Dfattal**: It's a little bit more involved than that, Brandon.
**Dfattal**: Because the thing is that at the end of the day I will say that we don't do, I mean we do a typical.
**Dfattal**: Like we do the scope of the typical ca.
**Kdannwolf**: Right.
**Dfattal**: Confirming that it's, you know, up to, up to date, up to progress, making sure conformity of the design, things like that.
**Dfattal**: The other part of the construction administration that we do is that we really contingent on who's building it and everything else.
**Dfattal**: We try to help, not try to help, but we be, we'll be on site to be able to make sure that everything stays on course and be proactive with all the things that have to happen for construction and everything else.
**Dfattal**: Understanding that you guys are the contractor as well, I'm assuming, right on this one.
**Speaker 4**: Yeah, we'll be the builder as well.
**Kdannwolf**: Yep.
**Dfattal**: Yeah.
**Dfattal**: So I, you know, it's, it's going to be, I think the dynamic might be a little bit different, but we do, and I just can't help reiterate this, but we do provide a Lot of hands on, on site just to be able to help facilitate, make sure everything's on schedule.
**Dfattal**: And I can even give you guys references like Water street for core here and everything else, especially projects in down south.
**Dfattal**: The best way I can help elaborate that is just talking to our past clients because we really do believe that our CA is extremely beneficial to the project and the teams and everything else.
**Dfattal**: It's a lot more in depth than.
**Bclymer**: Just a typical architect would provide.
**Speaker 4**: Who was the builder of Water Street?
**Dfattal**: Suffolk was Asher.
**Speaker 4**: And that's the one.
**Kdannwolf**: Correct?
**Dfattal**: Yeah, Asher was.
**Dfattal**: Was Suffolk and then Quora was Moss.
**Speaker 4**: Did either one of those.
**Speaker 4**: Were either one of those on the developer side too?
**Kdannwolf**: No.
**Speaker 4**: So that would be my thing.
**Speaker 4**: I don't doubt that it's valuable, but to be every other week, I, I mean again, like if, if I'm an owner, right, And I'm counting on the, the architect to make sure that everything adheres and he's certifying payment like yes, that makes sense to be on site, I would think.
**Speaker 4**: And Jesse Kurt me, if I'm wrong, that could probably be decreased to once a month, you know, unless again visits.
**Dfattal**: And stuff like that.
**Dfattal**: I mean that we obviously all those things are.
**Dfattal**: Or items that we can adjust, you know, contingent on.
**Dfattal**: We just, you know.
**Bclymer**: Well, let me just walk through that.
**Bclymer**: Let me just walk through the methodology I came up and maybe that's like a better way to kind of frame how we were.
**Bclymer**: Look at this.
**Bclymer**: In addition to this document you guys sent over, there was another one that had the kind of the start dates and the perceived stop dates for each of the buildings.
**Bclymer**: So what are you know, like buildings 19, you know, the apartment buildings and the ones on the island.
**Bclymer**: Those are, you know, those are kind of what we do a lot of.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: So typically a building like that would have three people on it through, through most of ca, right?
**Speaker 4**: The condos in the hotel and stuff.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, each of those would have, you know, three people on them.
**Bclymer**: So what I did is I looked at all the dates that you had and I said, hey, there's a lot of time where there's, there's not a lot of people.
**Bclymer**: So there's, you know, I think I priced.
**Bclymer**: Let me just take a look here.
**Bclymer**: I, I put in, you know, a duration for, you know, two, two staff members, you know, and I put 18 months.
**Bclymer**: Just kind of, you know, looking at the timelines and seeing how people would come off and on the job so that, you know, there's a good chunk of time where it's just Going to be two people and they can handle it.
**Bclymer**: And then as more and more buildings ramp up and those timelines overlap, I thought, okay, you're going to need to add people per, you know, per building almost as some of these things ramp up.
**Bclymer**: And then there's a period in like 2027, 2028 where there's multiple buildings going at once.
**Bclymer**: So that's why I put like, I think eight people on it towards the, you know, the middle of the job.
**Kdannwolf**: And then it.
**Bclymer**: And then.
**Bclymer**: Or nine actually.
**Bclymer**: And then it kind of ramps back down, you know, as some of the buildings on the island get completed in mid to late 2028.
**Bclymer**: But again, I quoted how the, how many people are there versus the timeline.
**Bclymer**: But it's not fixed.
**Bclymer**: So you know, if, if you guys are saying, hey, we think we are only going to need, you know, because we're the owner and the GC on this, so the scope is going to be reduced.
**Bclymer**: But maybe it doesn't ever gets to the nine people.
**Bclymer**: Maybe it stays the two or it becomes four and not six like there.
**Bclymer**: It's, it's really just, it's again hours.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: And which I'm trying to project into the future what these things take to put together based on past experiences.
**Bclymer**: We're going through a similar job in Naples right now on the Naples Four Seasons where we have a hotel, three condo towers on the beach.
**Bclymer**: We also do phase two at the same time now that started.
**Bclymer**: So there's another six condominium buildings on the.
**Bclymer**: Across A1A on the other side of the road on the golf course.
**Bclymer**: And there's multiple little buildings on the golf course.
**Bclymer**: So there's a lot of construction going on at once.
**Bclymer**: It's actually kind of neat to see because you see the hotel is almost done and then kind of look, look a little north and then there's, you know, just the framing of the foundations four buildings up.
**Bclymer**: So it's like you can see all the different construction in one one go of it.
**Bclymer**: But out there we have a staff of six people on site and four people back in the office working on, on basically ca.
**Bclymer**: On multiple buildings, answering questions, shop drawing.
**Bclymer**: Shop drawings are pretty heavy in the, you know, the, the multi family and the hotels and the number five building.
**Bclymer**: A lot of, you know, millwork and finishes and things like that that'll come through as shops provisioning all that between.
**Dfattal**: Submittals, artifiers and shops.
**Dfattal**: It's just, it's.
**Dfattal**: The assumption is that it's going to be a good volume of it.
**Jremillard**: So as you're on your administration and you're.
**Jremillard**: You put in numbers of people that were going to be on site.
**Bclymer**: Well, on site or in the office, I mean, generally something of this size, I would think there'd be a trailer for the architects, but that's.
**Bclymer**: You guys are the owners too, so it's entirely up to, you know, to your discretion.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, well, if you have people on site, that would make sense.
**Kdannwolf**: Yeah, that's.
**Speaker 4**: So I mean, there's a difference between in, you know, in the office in either Tampa or Fort Lauderdale or wherever versus being on site.
**Speaker 4**: So I would think that for you guys, right, if at least the way we do it, right.
**Speaker 4**: For our guys, like, you know, we have guys on site, like we gotta pay them, you know, per diem and housing and all that stuff.
**Speaker 4**: So did you price this as if having that staff on site or in the office?
**Bclymer**: I didn't price it as paying for per diem's or anything.
**Bclymer**: I just, I paid.
**Bclymer**: I price them as they were straight employees.
**Speaker 4**: So not on site.
**Bclymer**: Well, if they were on site and driving to and from their own house, that's the same as being an employee in my office.
**Bclymer**: If we had to, you know, house them there, then yeah, we'd want to talk to you guys about, you know, that stuff too.
**Speaker 4**: So do you guys have people that live locally that would staff this?
**Dfattal**: You guys are, you guys are right there in Fort Myers, right?
**Dfattal**: Yeah, the project itself.
**Dfattal**: So between the Naples office and between the Tampa office, we could have people there on site when needed.
**Kdannwolf**: Right.
**Dfattal**: It's all about like being.
**Dfattal**: Making ourselves available to you guys so that if you guys sat there and said, hey, we have a condition on site.
**Dfattal**: I need you guys here for a day or two, we can accommodate that.
**Kdannwolf**: Right.
**Dfattal**: And it's not an additional charge to you because it's already being accounted for.
**Bclymer**: But if we were to put people on, like in an apartment somewhere in Fort Myers, that would be, that would be.
**Bclymer**: We want to talk to you guys about housing and stuff like that.
**Speaker 4**: Gotcha.
**Speaker 4**: So your number does not include a full time staff on site.
**Speaker 4**: This is site visits.
**Bclymer**: Again, if it was, if it was one of our Naples people driving up every day and sitting in the trailer and driving back to their house, that's in the number if it's, if it's someone who's.
**Bclymer**: And the number is only going to go up by the, by the, you know, the cost of an apartment somewhere.
**Bclymer**: So I can just using Naples as an example again, Naples, we have two folks that move, relocated from the Hollywood Office to Naples for the duration.
**Bclymer**: And that ownership group pays us a flat rate of $5,000 a month for two apartments.
**Bclymer**: And that's.
**Bclymer**: That's the.
**Bclymer**: That's, you know, that's all they're paying for.
**Bclymer**: They're not paying for food, they're not paying for cars, not paying for.
**Bclymer**: For any of that other stuff.
**Kdannwolf**: It's.
**Bclymer**: It's just the cost of those people having housing out there.
**Kdannwolf**: Gotcha.
**Kdannwolf**: So.
**Speaker 4**: So when you say like this, it's $35,000 a month for two people, that's.
**Speaker 4**: That, you know, based off of this, that's two site visits, you know, a month per person.
**Speaker 4**: And if it's.
**Speaker 4**: If it's five, you know, six, eight, so on and so forth.
**Kdannwolf**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And like Danny was saying, like, look, we do see a.
**Bclymer**: A little bit differently.
**Bclymer**: Like, I've come to find out a lot of firms do it like an hourly, not to exceed, and all this stuff.
**Bclymer**: But our guys don't work on another project.
**Bclymer**: Like, they're.
**Bclymer**: They're your guys for the duration of the ca, right?
**Bclymer**: So they're dedicated to the project.
**Bclymer**: So like Danny was saying, like, if you have, you know, hey, we'd like you guys to come out tomorrow, take a look at this week.
**Bclymer**: We don't think this is going together.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: You know, come take a look.
**Kdannwolf**: That's.
**Bclymer**: There's not an additional charge for Danny to get in the car and drive down to you.
**Dfattal**: I'm not gonna nickel and dime you for the miles for the gas.
**Bclymer**: It's in there for that all inclusive.
**Kdannwolf**: Okay.
**Speaker 4**: Because, yeah, this says travel expenses to.
**Bclymer**: Be reimbursable if you're beyond a certain mileage.
**Bclymer**: But I think I looked at it and I think you guys are within the Naples or the.
**Bclymer**: Or the Tampa offices.
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: It's from your office, not from wherever your people are coming from.
**Kdannwolf**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: It's not for mine.
**Bclymer**: In Hollywood.
**Dfattal**: Yeah, that'd be a bit of a stretch.
**Kdannwolf**: Yeah, right.
**Speaker 4**: Like, damn, you drive a hard ship.
**Dfattal**: Yeah, like, it's.
**Kdannwolf**: Yeah, exactly.
**Dfattal**: Like, if it's like a, you know, like when I was, you know, for a while, just for an example, like when I was driving from Miami to Tampa for the OAC meetings for Water street, like, that was a reimbursable expense at the time because we didn't have the office infrastructure that we do now.
**Dfattal**: But because of proximity and everything else, we have a way to be able to facilitate that.
**Dfattal**: And I'll, you know, I'll still be managing all of the project and teams and everything else, so I'll.
**Dfattal**: Still be the main point of contact, but it's not going to be an additional fee or a nickel and dime or reimbursables that you're going to get from us to be able to go on site, do all these things, be able to facilitate.
**Dfattal**: And once again we do this.
**Dfattal**: I just can't stress this enough.
**Dfattal**: We really do this in the interest to make sure that everything's on schedule, on time and gets completed.
**Dfattal**: Both water, like we did this, we've done it for pretty much, I've done it for the last 15, 16 years with Kurt.
**Dfattal**: And the only time we've ever gone over schedule or over budget is because of the clients, you know, modifications or things like that.
**Dfattal**: But Water street, like the both projects on Water street, we were hands on.
**Dfattal**: Our office was five minutes down the street.
**Dfattal**: We literally walk over and we were on time and on under budget for both.
**Bclymer**: Danny wants to be a contractor in another life.
**Bclymer**: He likes spending time on sites.
**Kdannwolf**: But.
**Bclymer**: To Danny's point, he would be the principal in charge of the project.
**Bclymer**: And the way I ran out the staffing, every building has a team on it.
**Bclymer**: And so it kind of, you know, go to Danny and then several senior associates who would run buildings, or maybe if they're smaller buildings, they'd run two.
**Bclymer**: Maybe someone would run five and six because the parking garage is not going to need a lot of hand holding, but five will.
**Bclymer**: So they can cover two of them.
**Bclymer**: And each of those buildings under them would have, you know, team members under that.
**Bclymer**: So when everything's moving in 2020 from a design perspective, it's 2026 to 2028, you know, that, that the team's gonna be very large, you know, probably 20, 25 people will be drawing on this thing because if it really gets hot, all the buildings are starting to come up in their designs, you know, in that kind of two year time period.
**Speaker 4**: Yeah, I mean we know how to get Danny on site.
**Speaker 4**: It's literally just a case of Guinness.
**Kdannwolf**: It's true.
**Bclymer**: Used to be cigarettes.
**Bclymer**: So I'm glad, I'm glad it's getting healthier.
**Speaker 4**: And then, so okay, so, so one thing too, like under consultants.
**Speaker 4**: So you have in here, you know, life safety slash ada.
**Speaker 4**: So but then up further you call out that, you know, you've got life safety and whatnot in your, in your drawing.
**Speaker 4**: So can you clarify that?
**Speaker 4**: Like, are you guys going to give us life safety drawings or is that an added consultant cost?
**Bclymer**: We do the life safety drawings and then we have a outside third party review them.
**Bclymer**: Not so important on like 11 and 9 and the 10, 10, I think b and C, the townhomes and the buildings along the 10 and 11.
**Bclymer**: But no, excuse me, 10 and 19.
**Bclymer**: And then the hotels and stuff.
**Bclymer**: We would probably look at a company called SLS or there's another one that Danny likes out his wedding CCI to just go through some of this with us.
**Bclymer**: On the bigger buildings, they pay dividends with the smokey Vac and rational, rational smoke control.
**Bclymer**: So that, that actually brings the cost of those systems down.
**Bclymer**: And then there's the dull system that comes into play too.
**Bclymer**: So we'll do the drawings, but we'll have them fact check everything as well.
**Speaker 4**: So is what I'm hearing is, and correct me if I'm wrong, that in this price you have a complete stamped and sealed life safety drawing for the project.
**Bclymer**: Yes, yes, that, that, that I would probably be the seal on this.
**Bclymer**: So that would be my seal backed up with somebody else.
**Bclymer**: And then the smoke rationalization, an engineer would seal and they provide that to the MEP engineers who then use that to base the stair pressurization shafts on and the smoke control systems for like the two story lobbies and things like that.
**Kdannwolf**: Okay.
**Speaker 4**: I just want to make sure that there wasn't added cost to do the life safety and all that.
**Bclymer**: So you've got that?
**Kdannwolf**: Yeah, yeah.
**Kdannwolf**: That's awesome.
**Speaker 4**: All right, cool.
**Speaker 4**: And then same thing with interior design.
**Speaker 4**: So you have the interior design in your scope.
**Bclymer**: We have coordination of the interior design.
**Bclymer**: So I was envisioning you guys would probably come up with a.
**Bclymer**: And we can offer interior design if you need that for like the actual design work for the hotel and the lobbies of some of the bigger buildings.
**Bclymer**: If it's not done by us, we will coordinate with whatever interior designer you, you choose and incorporate.
**Bclymer**: Like, so typically the interior designer, I'll take drawings to about, you know, dd.
**Kdannwolf**: Right.
**Bclymer**: 100% dd, and then they'll hand it off to us to make sure that, you know, it's coordinated with mep.
**Bclymer**: They're providing enough backup for the walls for their stone or millwork or whatever they're putting on there.
**Bclymer**: The electrical stuff meets code in terms of outlets per hour, distance, things like that, depending on the typology of the.
**Dfattal**: Building and the permitting component of the two.
**Bclymer**: And then, yeah, those drawings, we permit those drawings.
**Bclymer**: And that's kind of a fine line.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Like, we don't include a lot of that typically into the permitting because you guys are going to pay permitting a bias sheet and we pull out a Lot of the ID stuff that's not relevant to the building code or life safety, so they're not looking at it and charging you guys for that.
**Speaker 4**: Yeah, absolutely.
**Dfattal**: Just to add is like, I just thought we were, you know, with everything that Alvaro would be potentially doing with GVI with regards to the exterior.
**Dfattal**: I didn't know if.
**Dfattal**: If that was.
**Dfattal**: You'd be doing interiors as well or if you.
**Dfattal**: Because mentioning it to Jesse, we do provide interior services in addition to everything.
**Bclymer**: Else, but I didn't include any design.
**Bclymer**: I included the coordination and the CDs of it, but not interior design.
**Bclymer**: Because typically, were you thinking, I. I've.
**Speaker 4**: Never worked with Alvaro.
**Speaker 4**: Were you thinking, is he does interior design stuff or.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, I mean, like, his.
**Jremillard**: I think they did everything on Serena.
**Dfattal**: That's what I remember.
**Dfattal**: I just.
**Dfattal**: That's what I.
**Dfattal**: That's what I figured.
**Dfattal**: Jesse.
**Dfattal**: Unless.
**Dfattal**: Because when I talked to Kurt about it, I had mentioned that, yes, we would be doing interiors as well, but I didn't know if you guys wanted us to be interior designer or if that would be with.
**Dfattal**: With Alvaro and gbi.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, we can do it.
**Bclymer**: You know, if you wanted to have us price out doing one or two buildings and somebody else does, we can do that too.
**Speaker 4**: The way I would think about it is, you know, the, the condos and hotel, you know, the townhomes, we don't need interior design like, or anything like that.
**Speaker 4**: That's all simple.
**Speaker 4**: But those would be the.
**Speaker 4**: The ones, I would think.
**Bclymer**: Absolutely.
**Kdannwolf**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I mean, the townhomes and the.
**Bclymer**: And the, the town, you probably need a very light interior design package to pick stones and things like that for the kitchen counters, the kitchen cabinetry, bathroom, maybe two or three typologies that a buyer can pick from.
**Bclymer**: But that's very light.
**Bclymer**: But like you were saying, the lobbies and the amenity spaces of the condo buildings, you know, 10, the tens, and the 19s, those would need some pretty heavy ID, and the hotel would take that a step further.
**Speaker 4**: Okay.
**Kdannwolf**: Yeah.
**Speaker 4**: I mean, I would say if you.
**Speaker 4**: If you guys have done that stuff and you know how to do it, I'd be interested to see what the number looks like for that.
**Speaker 4**: And if you've got some sort of, you know, book or whatever it is that shows examples of, you know, finished product.
**Kdannwolf**: Yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: We can, we can.
**Bclymer**: We can send you the portfolio and, you know, just cost, you know, of.
**Bclymer**: We want me to pick a building.
**Bclymer**: Is there a building you had in mind that we can look at for you or.
**Speaker 4**: Yeah, I mean, I would do it, the hotel is key.
**Speaker 4**: That's kind of like our crown jewel.
**Kdannwolf**: Okay.
**Speaker 4**: And then the, like I said the two 600 unit condos or 300 unit condos.
**Dfattal**: So 9A, 9B.
**Dfattal**: Would that be first sight?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I keep saying 19.
**Bclymer**: Sorry, it's 9amb.
**Speaker 4**: Yeah, it's not that big of a project.
**Bclymer**: Took me a while to get my head around it with all the little numbers on there and the start and stop dates of everything.
**Speaker 4**: And so as far as like timeline goes, so, you know, I, you know, the soonest I think, you know, we probably get started would be October.
**Speaker 4**: Okay, what does that look like as far as your guys's workload and stuff?
**Speaker 4**: I don't know.
**Speaker 4**: You mentioned, you know, next year and I didn't know what you were, you know, manpower wise had.
**Bclymer**: Oh, no, no.
**Bclymer**: So definitely I was thinking the start date was October based on the, the other drawing like this that had the start and stop dates on it.
**Bclymer**: So I was thinking we'd start out, we start off relatively light, team of, you know, maybe four or five people.
**Bclymer**: And then it starts to really ramp up as those other buildings start coming into design.
**Bclymer**: So it seemed like.
**Bclymer**: And correct.
**Bclymer**: If I'm wrong, you were building the.
**Bclymer**: What numbers are they?
**Bclymer**: The 11A through 11A.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, the 11 ones were first.
**Bclymer**: And then you're kind of building your way towards the island.
**Bclymer**: And then as the island got done, those buildings started to come out of the ground as well.
**Speaker 4**: Correct.
**Speaker 4**: Yeah, yeah.
**Speaker 4**: The first thing is getting up, you know, all that stuff, you know, on the future, you know, you know, revised golf course to, you know, get that up, done, you know, refinance, pull out cash, you know, and you know, go, you know, get that, get that cash flowing.
**Kdannwolf**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So yeah, that's, that's, that's.
**Bclymer**: And that's what your, your pack explained.
**Bclymer**: So that's how I, I base it.
**Bclymer**: This stuff would all be first to go.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: And, and you know, the durations that you had in the pack were, were pretty aggressive.
**Bclymer**: So it might.
**Bclymer**: I put diff.
**Bclymer**: I put different durations for them in the, in this, the schedule.
**Bclymer**: But we probably want to make sure we gave enough time to the 1.
**Bclymer**: The buildings on the island.
**Bclymer**: I'm not so worried about the townhomes and the ones that are highlighted on the screen.
**Bclymer**: It's more the, the 9A and B and then the ones on the island that are probably going to take a bit of time.
**Speaker 4**: Yeah, I would.
**Speaker 4**: I like.
**Speaker 4**: So it's not what I'm.
**Speaker 4**: What it sounds to me like what you're saying is, like, it's a start finish relationship, meaning, like you do the elevens and then go to the stuff on the island.
**Speaker 4**: But, you know, in reality, what I would expect is it would be a start start.
**Speaker 4**: Right.
**Speaker 4**: And so you have to start on the island buildings, you know, as soon as possible as well.
**Bclymer**: Exactly.
**Bclymer**: So there's going to be a slow start to get all of the stuff on the.
**Bclymer**: The yellow done.
**Kdannwolf**: Right.
**Bclymer**: And as we're.
**Bclymer**: As we're maybe in DD on that stuff, the other buildings will start design too.
**Bclymer**: And we'd have to work out with you guys which ones the dates are there.
**Bclymer**: But just confirming all that how you would envision it going?
**Bclymer**: But yes, those are going to take longer.
**Bclymer**: So they, you know, there'd be a slow ramp up with the yellow buildings, and then when they hit dd, you'd see more people added to the project working on the blue and the orange, almost starting at the same time.
**Bclymer**: So early next year, the team would start to be Fairly big in 2026, like we talked about.
**Bclymer**: So our office would be, we.
**Bclymer**: We have this based in Tampa.
**Bclymer**: And then there'd be staff here in Hollywood as well.
**Bclymer**: I would envision working on it.
**Bclymer**: I'll probably put a set of eyes on this because that's what I do for all of them.
**Bclymer**: I'm actually sitting here looking at phase two of Naples just to go through their second round of drawings.
**Bclymer**: So I like to get eyes on the buildings before they go out to the owners and general contractors.
**Bclymer**: So, yeah, from a staffing point of view, we've got 140 people, so it's a big job.
**Bclymer**: I'm not underestimating this in any sense, and I do think there will be, you know, upwards of 25 people on this job when it's really moving.
**Bclymer**: And that's why I was envisioning it break.
**Bclymer**: You know, there's.
**Bclymer**: There's Danny at me and then there's Danny at the head of it, and then there's several senior people under Danny, each controlling a product, a building or two typology, and then teams underneath that.
**Speaker 4**: Yeah.
**Speaker 4**: So I would.
**Speaker 4**: And I'll go ahead and tell you this, Kurt, you know, the only reason that you're.
**Speaker 4**: You guys are in this meeting is because of Danny.
**Kdannwolf**: You know, he.
**Speaker 4**: I mean, that's.
**Speaker 4**: I mean, you know, give credit where credit is due.
**Dfattal**: I appreciate it.
**Kdannwolf**: Thank you.
**Speaker 4**: You know, Jesse worked with them and spoke very highly of him.
**Speaker 4**: You know, I met him and, you know, worked with him, and he, you know, he tried like Hell, to get us on that Avery job from my understanding, I'm glad the hell we're not on it, but, you know, like that, you know, we're, We're.
**Speaker 4**: We're big into relationships, we're easy to work with, and, you know, that's what, that's what we like.
**Speaker 4**: So, you know, having Danny lead, it is.
**Speaker 4**: Is a non negotiable, you know, for us.
**Bclymer**: I need to keep him busy and off the cigarettes in the Guinness.
**Bclymer**: So he needs something to do.
**Speaker 4**: Well, he's still gonna drink Guinness with us.
**Speaker 4**: Like, that's, that's what's gonna happen.
**Dfattal**: Guinness is kind of important, Kurt.
**Kdannwolf**: Yeah.
**Speaker 4**: Otherwise nothing gets done, you know.
**Bclymer**: Absolutely.
**Kdannwolf**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So we just moved Danny into a new office out there too.
**Bclymer**: So we were kind of investing heavily in, In Tampa.
**Bclymer**: Danny's, you know, proven his worth and.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, so we've got him in a new office, got.
**Bclymer**: Got him adding staff.
**Bclymer**: So we're pretty happy with what's going on out there.
**Kdannwolf**: Okay.
**Speaker 4**: Now, you know, you know, one thing like, so what we're, you know, talking, you know, talking to, you know, some of the partners and stuff, so there's, you know, the island and the gist of it.
**Speaker 4**: A lot of this stuff is going to, you know, to, to remain the same.
**Speaker 4**: But for instance, like, you know, we want, you know, we're going to delete that boat storage.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I didn't price that out.
**Bclymer**: That was.
**Bclymer**: You mentioned that in the last meeting.
**Speaker 4**: Okay.
**Speaker 4**: All right.
**Speaker 4**: Yeah, so.
**Speaker 4**: So you don't have that boat storage, but we will be, you know, replacing, you know, something, you know, along that.
**Kdannwolf**: That area.
**Speaker 4**: Like, you know, I'm like, I'm thinking of like that.
**Speaker 4**: That building number one, you know, coming over and doing an L so that you have, you know, more waterfront space like that.
**Speaker 4**: So, you know, extending that building is an idea.
**Speaker 4**: Now, granted, we got to make sure that our, you know, we can.
**Speaker 4**: We get the sign off on the added occupancy numbers.
**Speaker 4**: But that's, you know, one idea we had and just some other stuff on that.
**Speaker 4**: So, you know, this, this will change, you know, a little bit, you know, based on what we can do.
**Speaker 4**: You know, I think Jesse's, I don't know, next couple weeks or whatever, he's got to go down there and talk to the, the building department, you know, and see what we can get away with.
**Kdannwolf**: Got it.
**Speaker 4**: Is that, Is that an issue?
**Speaker 4**: You know, for you guys?
**Speaker 4**: You know, it's good to know this is a little bit, you know, we know this is going to shift a Little bit.
**Bclymer**: No, I mean again, using the Naples one as a reference.
**Bclymer**: These things are, this is a vast project and it's, it's, you know, really, you know, long term development.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: So it's just assumed you're going to make some modifications to this stuff as you, you know, as you're looking at it now and as you see the market conditions in two.
**Kdannwolf**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: That, you know, whether the island gets.
**Bclymer**: I, I always wasn't thinking the island was going to get smaller, but you know, that's an option.
**Bclymer**: You just don't build as much of it.
**Speaker 4**: No, it's.
**Speaker 4**: Island has to stay the same.
**Speaker 4**: We can't adjust the footprint because.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, so then, then it's assumed you're going to do something else with where the boat storage was.
**Bclymer**: I didn't, I just didn't price it because I had no idea what it was.
**Bclymer**: So, you know, we, we can cross that bridge when you guys, you know, figure out what's best use, highest and best use for that site.
**Bclymer**: But yeah, it, you guys adding and kind of subtracting things as we go along is, you know, that kind of happens on these large projects.
**Kdannwolf**: Gotcha.
**Speaker 4**: Okay, Jesse, what, what questions did you guys.
**Speaker 4**: Did you have?
**Jremillard**: Just when some of these buildings, you know, like all of the retail space is all shell space.
**Jremillard**: Like how did, like how did you figure that as part of your design?
**Jremillard**: Did you just say that's just gonna be columns and white boxed or.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, what we've done in the past with like the ground floor stuff is, you know, you'll, you'll provide, you might even need.
**Bclymer**: Like in Miami, we don't provide a slab for the ground floor.
**Bclymer**: And I've seen that done, you know, other places in Florida too, so that the tenant can move bathrooms around or whatever they wanted to do or provide a kitchen for, for a restaurant.
**Bclymer**: So that becomes a conversation, right?
**Bclymer**: We'll have an NEP guy on board.
**Bclymer**: Your team will start marketing team and it'll say, hey, you got all this ground floor space.
**Bclymer**: Wouldn't be great to have a restaurant here or there, whatever.
**Bclymer**: And then they'll start talking about electrical loads, gas lines, grease trap locations, garbage that's air conditioned, so that doesn't stink.
**Bclymer**: All those things that go with a restaurant.
**Bclymer**: And then there'll be a cost in there.
**Bclymer**: Then we'll all kind of go, whoa, that's a lot.
**Bclymer**: And we'll dial it back to, you know, the two corners might be restaurants, but any of that is just, it's, it's either got a slab or it doesn't.
**Bclymer**: It's columns.
**Bclymer**: It's, you know, stubbed in for the utilities.
**Bclymer**: It may, it may have an AC hanging in the ceiling or a closet somewhere with an AC, but no ductwork.
**Bclymer**: Or sometimes the ACs are left out as well.
**Bclymer**: And then you just have the code minimum lighting and the code minimum fire protection.
**Bclymer**: But you know, if it's a, A first floor is divided into like four bays.
**Bclymer**: Typically the developer doesn't even divide it into bays.
**Bclymer**: It's just all open so someone can take, you know, more space or less space.
**Bclymer**: And so not knowing any of that, I just said it's cold, dark, shell.
**Kdannwolf**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: And then, you know, they got all these rooftop pools, which I don't like number one because they're over condos and occupied spaces.
**Jremillard**: Does that simplify your design?
**Jremillard**: If we either get rid of some of these or rework them in, you know, the building footprint to put them lower, maybe off the first floor or something like that.
**Bclymer**: I mean, most buildings, we do now have some sort of rooftop of many.
**Bclymer**: It seems to be expected at the higher price points now.
**Bclymer**: You know, rooftop plunge pool with a view.
**Bclymer**: You know, so if you're marketing, people don't need.
**Bclymer**: Does make the building somewhat simpler.
**Bclymer**: But you still have the same, you know, you still have to coordinate with the pool, you know, pool equipment room, getting lines to the pool, sizing all the heaters and getting venting to work for those things.
**Bclymer**: If they're gas, where you put the pool, it, it's.
**Bclymer**: We've done enough of them.
**Bclymer**: If they're on the roof, it doesn't really complicate things.
**Bclymer**: It just.
**Bclymer**: We would recommend highly doing them out of steel.
**Bclymer**: Just because of what you mentioned with the, with the leaks and you know, things like the over occupied space.
**Bclymer**: We've never had a steel pull leak.
**Jremillard**: That's a good idea.
**Kdannwolf**: Yeah.
**Dfattal**: So Jesse, just, just to add to that real quick.
**Dfattal**: I'm sorry, to Kurt's point, predominantly we'll do a stainless steel pool on top of roofs.
**Dfattal**: Very, very few.
**Dfattal**: I don't think we've ever done a cast in place pool on top of a, on top of a building.
**Dfattal**: We've done.
**Dfattal**: Yeah, only, but that, that's about it.
**Kdannwolf**: Right.
**Dfattal**: So there, but there's an opportunity there, Jesse, that if those pools do stay up there, to Kurt's point, we've gotten really good at working with the right partners and making sure that they're viable and consistent and, and work and don't leak.
**Kdannwolf**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: And then when it comes to.
**Jremillard**: So when our subcontractors do their BIM coordination modeling.
**Jremillard**: You guys, your part of your CM time is having someone involved in all those meetings.
**Bclymer**: So we've been looking into this on other jobs, Jesse, and we've had the subcontractors seem to be coming into the market and looking at our model, the structural model and the, the MEP model, but not necessarily the drawings.
**Bclymer**: So one of the things we need to kind of ensure would be they're actually the drawings.
**Bclymer**: A lot of times the structure guys in particular will have notes in the drawings about, you know, you can have this many penetrations through our link beams and the shear walls, but they're not modeling those penetrations because they don't, you know, they would never get to that level of detail.
**Bclymer**: Our guys will model the larger the penetrations, you know, up to like a, you know, down to like a two inch sleeve or something.
**Bclymer**: But the conduits, like the three quarter conduits and stuff, we would rely on those notes in the structural drawings.
**Bclymer**: Front set that says, hey, you can have third of the way down, third of the way into the, into the beam.
**Bclymer**: You can place as much, you know, conduit as you want or whatever.
**Kdannwolf**: Right.
**Bclymer**: So we're happy to be, you know, in those, in those meetings, but we just take care that they're being done the right way that, you know, we're not doing shop drawings for the subcontractor because we've, I found our guys doing that rabbit hole.
**Bclymer**: It's just not productive because we get back our own shop drawings.
**Bclymer**: Essentially, they print our drawings, put them on their title lock and give it back to us as a, as a shop drawing.
**Dfattal**: So just to add to that, Jesse, it's like, yes, we have and will participate in third part.
**Dfattal**: Like, if you have your team and BIM modeling and everything else, we'll have somebody participate and make sure that we're, you know, not messing with our slab heights or ceiling heights or anything else when everything gets, you know, for clash detection, we just don't do clash detection and we actually do it now, Danny.
**Dfattal**: Oh, we do do it now.
**Bclymer**: CSer's team does do clash detection before we send the drawings out.
**Bclymer**: The problem is, is that the MEP and the structure models are never as far along as ours.
**Bclymer**: So that's a conversation, Jesse, that we should have with some of the subs.
**Bclymer**: Because one of the ideas we had was just to give the architectural model and let the subs build off of that to ensure that their trades are getting built the way they want it.
**Bclymer**: Not, you know, just saying, oh, The MEP Guy didn't put his ducks in the right place.
**Bclymer**: That's it, you know?
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: I think just from my experience with that, like, I would like, you know, because I'll be heavily involved with the whole design process and something I enjoy doing and just having that before we actually turn it over to the subs.
**Jremillard**: You and me, Danny, and our teams have went through, and we've already identified the problem, pinch points and the things that they're going to have to solve and just have.
**Jremillard**: It just starts things out a lot easier.
**Jremillard**: It seems like every time in the past, we get it, and all the subs are like, oh, great, man.
**Jremillard**: They put a ductwork through a toilet or something like that, you know, like, why'd they even draw this?
**Jremillard**: You know?
**Jremillard**: And then we got to figure out all the problems.
**Jremillard**: So I would like to have just a more refined.
**Jremillard**: Like, when we're done, you turn that over.
**Jremillard**: It's something that's got things that can be worked out relatively easy.
**Kdannwolf**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: What we can do, Jesse, if, you know, you like, we can get another call together with Caesar, who runs our BIM department, and he can just walk you through what.
**Bclymer**: What we do is a clash detection before the drawings go out to you and the GC in the sub market.
**Bclymer**: We're working on a building right now in Miami that just last week, we got our own internal clash detection report from Caesar and his team.
**Bclymer**: And, you know, our guys are working through with the MEP and the structure guys.
**Bclymer**: So it is beneficial.
**Bclymer**: We come up with a lot of stuff.
**Bclymer**: Will we catch it all?
**Bclymer**: I mean, probably not, because a lot of times, too, the subcontractors have just a.
**Bclymer**: Hey, I want to run the pipes over here, not over here, because I'm going to put that fire line in before the duck gets there, right?
**Bclymer**: So I know that's going to be in first.
**Bclymer**: So it's got to make way for the duct.
**Bclymer**: A lot of times, you know, we don't know the sequencing or the contractually, how subs are going to build stuff.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: So that we can't take that into account.
**Bclymer**: And that goes into the bim, Those BIM meetings, you know, when I used to do them, it was at a light table, and everybody came with a different color set of drawings.
**Bclymer**: And we overlaid them.
**Kdannwolf**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Looked at them together, and the duck guy and pipe guy would, you know, hey, I can't be there because, you know, I got to go first, and, you know, you got to move over six inches.
**Kdannwolf**: Well, I.
**Bclymer**: Causes a problem at the wall or Whatever.
**Bclymer**: So that's still a subcontractor level issue.
**Bclymer**: It's not, you know, we're not saying we're going to give them perfect stuff and they're going to be able to, you know, run off and do.
**Bclymer**: They're still going to need to look at it and do their, their shops off of their own stuff, but we'll try and alleviate as much as we can internally before we.
**Bclymer**: We get to that point.
**Kdannwolf**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: And did you have anything on the golf course itself that's completely.
**Dfattal**: Yeah, that was the one thing, Jesse, we didn't.
**Dfattal**: I mean, that was when you and I was with somebody else.
**Dfattal**: Like, we did not.
**Kdannwolf**: I had.
**Bclymer**: I did include 10C though.
**Bclymer**: Danny, if there's like an amenity clubhouse or something.
**Dfattal**: Clubhouse, but not the actual physical golf course, right?
**Kdannwolf**: Kirk?
**Bclymer**: No, no, I, I left the golf course out, but the.
**Bclymer**: I think 10C has a 10C and 5 seem to have amenities for the golf course, but they're not.
**Kdannwolf**: No.
**Kdannwolf**: Kirk.
**Speaker 4**: 10C, that amenity park is for those condos and townhomes all the time.
**Bclymer**: Oh, okay.
**Kdannwolf**: Okay.
**Speaker 4**: Yeah, the number five, that's the golf club.
**Kdannwolf**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So, yeah, I included five and, and 10C.
**Bclymer**: I, I included as well.
**Bclymer**: And then I also.
**Bclymer**: It's not the.
**Bclymer**: What are they, 11A through D?
**Bclymer**: In the verbiage of the pack, it mentioned that they have.
**Bclymer**: They each have.
**Bclymer**: Each side of the road has its own pool and clubhouse.
**Bclymer**: I included those pools and clubhouses, but I just figured they're like a, you know, cabana bathroom.
**Bclymer**: It's a party room or something, you know, that you kind of see with that product.
**Bclymer**: But they're included in the scope as well.
**Bclymer**: Is Building 18 getting captured, that maintenance building out in the golf course?
**Dfattal**: I don't believe so.
**Bclymer**: No.
**Kdannwolf**: Left.
**Bclymer**: Where is 18?
**Bclymer**: Sorry.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: No, I did not grab that.
**Bclymer**: But I mean, it's a maintenance building, so if we need to throw that in to make the deal work.
**Bclymer**: Danny's doing a maintenance building.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah, I did include the little entry gatehouses, the 11E and F there.
**Bclymer**: They're included in that.
**Bclymer**: I, I saw some verbiage in there about those.
**Bclymer**: I'm assuming they're kind of like a mirror of each other.
**Bclymer**: You know, ENF and CMD are mirrors down there.
**Kdannwolf**: Great, great.
**Jremillard**: And then up, up by the.
**Kdannwolf**: Oh, this guy.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I included that 1.11A and 11C are in there.
**Kdannwolf**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: And then up by the, the inlet there into the harbor, they got.
**Jremillard**: There's some bathrooms up there that.
**Jremillard**: There's like a fishing pier that sticks out there.
**Dfattal**: Is it these two here, very small.
**Bclymer**: Oh, I didn't.
**Bclymer**: I didn't know what they were.
**Bclymer**: They didn't have any verbiage to them, so I wasn't sure if they were part of.
**Bclymer**: So I didn't include those.
**Bclymer**: But again, if it's a shelter.
**Kdannwolf**: And.
**Bclymer**: Is it.
**Bclymer**: Is the lighthouse existing?
**Bclymer**: Because it seemed in the verbiage that there was an existing lighthouse that the number two was kind of design inspiration from.
**Speaker 4**: No, there's no existing lighthouse there.
**Kdannwolf**: Got it.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So you're building a lighthouse.
**Bclymer**: A pavilion.
**Bclymer**: Pavilion's set of bathrooms, and the shelter is a kayak storage building.
**Bclymer**: Again, if you want to just give me a brief scope of work for those, I think we can probably make those work within the number we have.
**Bclymer**: If it's just bathrooms and some kind of, like, picnic shelters and things.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, we'll figure that one out with you guys.
**Jremillard**: And then as far as the marina, like that, I would imagine our marina contractor.
**Jremillard**: That's something that.
**Jremillard**: Is that fully their design.
**Jremillard**: And you guys.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, we don't.
**Kdannwolf**: We've.
**Bclymer**: We worked on a marina years ago up in St. Augustine, but we worked with a marina designer that kind of knew the turning radiuses and how the boats worked and everything.
**Bclymer**: So it was kind of all theirs.
**Bclymer**: And then, you know, we just connected it back to the.
**Bclymer**: To the boardwalk we had.
**Jremillard**: Do we need something for that Boardwalk.
**Bclymer**: Down and plan southeast.
**Bclymer**: That building 13.
**Bclymer**: Where.
**Bclymer**: I'm sorry, where's 13 guys?
**Jremillard**: Lower.
**Speaker 4**: Right next to.
**Speaker 4**: Next to 9A.
**Speaker 4**: It's down there.
**Speaker 4**: That condo.
**Speaker 4**: It's just a.
**Speaker 4**: It's boardwalk.
**Speaker 4**: I would connect to that neighborhood.
**Kdannwolf**: That.
**Bclymer**: Was by the landscape architect, because that's.
**Speaker 4**: Yeah, the landscape would take care of that.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, it seems like something he'd do with, like, the.
**Bclymer**: And then as for, like, the.
**Kdannwolf**: The.
**Bclymer**: I'm not sure how you say it.
**Bclymer**: It's the Spanish version of a boulevard or.
**Bclymer**: Or boardwalk about Malacon.
**Bclymer**: I should know how to say it since I'm living in South Florida, but I'm envisioning.
**Bclymer**: All that was by the landscape guy, too.
**Bclymer**: We'd coordinate with him, but that's his design.
**Kdannwolf**: And he.
**Bclymer**: He document the PA of that.
**Speaker 4**: Yeah, that's that site for.
**Speaker 4**: In front of the.
**Speaker 4**: Into the number four.
**Kdannwolf**: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Kdannwolf**: Okay, I see it.
**Dfattal**: Yeah, it's the whole run, right?
**Speaker 4**: Yeah, yeah, it's just all the.
**Speaker 4**: All those pavers around.
**Bclymer**: Do you guys have a landscape architect on board that you're working with?
**Speaker 4**: It'll be under our civilization, which is Hans.
**Speaker 4**: So.
**Kdannwolf**: Okay.
**Speaker 4**: Anything else, Jesse?
**Dfattal**: The Tidal lagoon.
**Dfattal**: Is that like a wave generator or is that just what you guys are calling thing?
**Dfattal**: I didn't.
**Speaker 4**: That's, that basically is like.
**Kdannwolf**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: So they've made it so the water can circulate around this when the tide goes in and out filters the water, basically.
**Dfattal**: Oh.
**Dfattal**: Hence the title lagoon.
**Kdannwolf**: Got.
**Dfattal**: Okay, understood.
**Dfattal**: I didn't.
**Bclymer**: It's the moat.
**Kdannwolf**: Yep.
**Kdannwolf**: Fair.
**Kdannwolf**: Okay.
**Dfattal**: Any other questions?
**Dfattal**: That or anything else to help clarify or.
**Dfattal**: And if there is, and we can't think of any, just, I mean, you can always reach out to me.
**Dfattal**: Brandon, you can always reach out to me.
**Dfattal**: Happy to get back to you as soon as we can.
**Speaker 4**: Yeah, I don't have anything else.
**Speaker 4**: I mean, obviously the biggest thing, you know, you know, Kurt or Danny, whoever, if you can let me know, like, about that two and a half percent, you know, what that looks like.
**Speaker 4**: And then interior design.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, interior design will take me a couple of days to pull together with the, with the ID department, but I think it's.
**Speaker 4**: Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's.
**Speaker 4**: Next week's fine.
**Speaker 4**: I, I, it's not.
**Speaker 4**: I don't have to have it tomorrow.
**Kdannwolf**: Okay.
**Kdannwolf**: Just.
**Speaker 4**: Anything else?
**Jremillard**: No, I think.
**Jremillard**: And your price includes, like, you know, if we hire the Kimley Horn, MEP guys like you would be coordinating that with them.
**Bclymer**: That, that's part of what we have to do.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, Any coordination, regardless of who holds the contract, we have to do the coordination.
**Bclymer**: So, you know, there'll be a long list of consultants that, that's going to be required for, for this overall, and we'll have to coordinate all their work.
**Kdannwolf**: That, that's just, that's just what we do.
**Kdannwolf**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, because I've been involved, too.
**Jremillard**: Or if you didn't, if they weren't underneath you, then it's almost like the architect's like, well, that's your own consultant.
**Jremillard**: It's not me.
**Jremillard**: You know, it's like, you know, it's.
**Bclymer**: Funny, Jesse, I hear that, I hear that a lot from people, and it's just like, I don't understand that, that that's the architect's role, to make sure it all fits together, you know?
**Kdannwolf**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I can't imagine throwing my hands up and saying, yeah, let the MEP guy do it himself, because that just.
**Dfattal**: I don't want them to be himself.
**Bclymer**: Exactly.
**Speaker 4**: I mean, it's the same thing with us.
**Speaker 4**: Whenever we, like, if I always tell our guys, like, they're on site, like, I don't care if it's an owner vendor, we're running the site, help them get their job.
**Speaker 4**: Done and figure it out.
**Speaker 4**: Coordinate like.
**Kdannwolf**: Yeah.
**Speaker 4**: Otherwise everybody's screwed.
**Kdannwolf**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Just be part of the team, right?
**Bclymer**: I mean, yeah.
**Kdannwolf**: Cool.
**Speaker 4**: Awesome.
**Speaker 4**: Well, I appreciate the time, guys.
**Dfattal**: Thank you, guys.
**Dfattal**: I really appreciate it.
**Bclymer**: Thank you, guys.
**Dfattal**: Jesse squared.
**Dfattal**: Thanks, guys.
**Kdannwolf**: All right.
**Kdannwolf**: Thank you all.
**Bclymer**: Good talking to you.
**Dfattal**: See you guys.
**Kdannwolf**: Bye.
**Kdannwolf**: Bye.
**Kdannwolf**: Bye.
