**Bclymer**: Is that a big holiday down there, Maria?
**Bclymer**: No.
**Adelgado**: So it is a personal holiday for me because my daughter is turning five months today.
**Adelgado**: Oh, that's why.
**Adelgado**: But no single mayor here is not a huge thing.

**Gducharme**: Awesome, guys.
**Adelgado**: So let's start.
**Adelgado**: Where is my.
**Adelgado**: One second.
**Gducharme**: What is wrong.
**Adelgado**: Here?
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: Okay, guys, good.
**Adelgado**: So projects.
**Adelgado**: But AG is not here, correct?
**Adelgado**: No.
**Adelgado**: So let's start with Uniqlo.
**Adelgado**: This is you.
**Adelgado**: Just random.
**Bclymer**: So on that one.
**Bclymer**: We got a revised price today from the electrician for the added outlets they requested.
**Bclymer**: We got a price last week from the plumber for the added sand oil separator.
**Bclymer**: And we submitted.
**Bclymer**: I think he said he was going to submit it.
**Bclymer**: The fire sprinkler sub.
**Bclymer**: His permit.
**Bclymer**: The plumber's got his permit done and DE has their permit done.
**Bclymer**: So I have not sent those to the lady in the city yet, so.
**Bclymer**: But I got all three of them now, I think.
**Bclymer**: Brandon, did you give Tim a price to put in there for his electrical, or were you just gonna have him put his price in there?
**Jdawson**: I said we just haven't put his price in there.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: Something else, Jesse.
**Jdawson**: So you can mark under tasks like request pricing from plumbing, electrical.
**Jdawson**: So that's done.
**Jdawson**: What's full infrastructure project?
**Jmendez**: Exactly.
**Jdawson**: What's that supposed to be?
**Adelgado**: Let's see.
**Adelgado**: It has 2 comments on it met with exotic this morning.
**Adelgado**: I think that's kind of old as February.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So you can mark that as done.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: What's missing?
**Adelgado**: Another task.
**Jdawson**: So, yeah.
**Jdawson**: So we need to submit.
**Jdawson**: Submit the change order for the drawing changes.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And then I don't think.
**Jdawson**: I mean, we need to build the job and job planner and then start getting subcontracts done.
**Jdawson**: I need to update the schedule per our last scheduling meeting.
**Jdawson**: You can assign Mike Parsons as the superintendent to all of these ones.
**Jdawson**: No, he's just.
**Jdawson**: Just in general, that job is.
**Jdawson**: Mike is going to be the superintendent.
**Adelgado**: Let me see.
**Adelgado**: Mike Parsons.
**Adelgado**: He's here.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: What else?
**Jdawson**: From here Schedule the meeting.
**Jdawson**: I don't know what that is.
**Jdawson**: Go back.
**Adelgado**: You.
**Adelgado**: You were going to say schedule the meeting and then I interrupted.
**Jdawson**: No, I was saying I need to update the schedule per our last scheduling meeting.
**Jdawson**: So just say update, update job schedule.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Any.
**Jdawson**: Oh, we need to get that.
**Jdawson**: Obviously the thing.
**Jdawson**: When you get that fence ordered.
**Jdawson**: Jesse.
**Jdawson**: I don't know.
**Bclymer**: I mean, we got a sub.
**Bclymer**: We just got to call them up.
**Bclymer**: I think we may have to fill out a credit app or something and then send it to them.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: What are we going to do if this APM doesn't take the job?
**Bclymer**: Well, I found.
**Bclymer**: I don't know.
**Bclymer**: They.
**Bclymer**: I got a resume last week.
**Bclymer**: I need to review it and.
**Ataylor**: You don't have to.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we also need to obviously get the submittals going too.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: Something else.
**Jdawson**: That's it.
**Adelgado**: Another AGX here.
**Adelgado**: So current day oig.
**Njepson**: Yes.
**Njepson**: Corm.
**Njepson**: Dale, what did I put there?
**Njepson**: Yeah, so we got our approval.
**Njepson**: I put a deadline on myself to send the owner contract to him tomorrow.
**Njepson**: And I need to get job planner set up, budget built, working on that updated interior pricing.
**Njepson**: And I'll get.
**Njepson**: I only have two contracts to write for that.
**Njepson**: It'd be a earthwork contract as of now and the asphalt path contract.
**Njepson**: So I'll get those done by end of week.
**Njepson**: Yep.
**Njepson**: I already signed the proposal for the civil guy and released him.
**Njepson**: He'll start.
**Njepson**: He'll start looking at staking and everything else needed for the city of Carmel next week.
**Jdawson**: Civil like engineer?
**Njepson**: Yeah, Crossroads.
**Njepson**: Carmel's making us do third party inspections and so the reason I have to get an updated contract to him is because it added $10,000.
**Njepson**: So.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: AJ restaurant builder, Crate.
**Njepson**: Yeah, I'm just waiting on accounting to send me an invoice.
**Njepson**: I think they're working on it, so.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: Everything is here.
**Adelgado**: Assembly for.
**Adelgado**: Okay, this is in progress.
**Adelgado**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: Goodwill, Tremont, Brandon and I think this is going to be just.
**Jdawson**: Is that Restaurant build out?
**Jdawson**: Is.
**Jdawson**: Is that the one that I sent back today?
**Jdawson**: The lean waiver signed?
**Njepson**: No, this one was just a little.
**Njepson**: We did the electrical for Coastal Cantina in there.
**Njepson**: It's a bunch of added outlets.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Njepson**: Sending them an invoice directly.
**Njepson**: There's no lien waiver associated.
**Njepson**: That one is the final one for.
**Njepson**: For Crate Escapes to actually close out the bank billing.
**Njepson**: And I'll get Liz to notarize that and then we'll send it over.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: Goodwill, Tremond, Jesse, Brendan, Nick.
**Njepson**: That one.
**Speaker 7**: That one.
**Speaker 7**: We're working on getting updated drawings and then proposal to Goodwill.
**Bclymer**: Okay, hold on.
**Bclymer**: We're Tremont.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, sorry, I can't see which.
**Bclymer**: So there is no proposal to owner, correct?
**Bclymer**: Brandon?
**Jdawson**: There's no.
**Jdawson**: What?
**Bclymer**: Traymont?
**Bclymer**: There's no proposal to owner on that.
**Bclymer**: We're just doing it.
**Bclymer**: Correct.
**Jdawson**: Correct.
**Jdawson**: But we still need to.
**Jdawson**: I.
**Jdawson**: I want to figure out what our actual costs are, and then that way I can, you know, like, you know, I can go back to Jared, and if this thing's a hundred thousand dollars, I can be like, hey, man, I didn't budget 100 grand.
**Jdawson**: So we can do one or two things.
**Jdawson**: We can either cut some stuff or we can just invoice you monthly as a.
**Jdawson**: As a direct cost through facilities or something like that to make up some of this difference.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: Port Collective.
**Jdawson**: Andres, where are we at on your drawing?
**Ataylor**: Yeah, I will finish today that.
**Ataylor**: Port Collective.
**Ataylor**: I will send you the.
**Ataylor**: The drawing.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: So finishing drawings on him.
**Adelgado**: This poor collective estimate is still not started.
**Jdawson**: Correct.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: Not sorted.
**Adelgado**: Seminole Collective, this is Jesse.
**Bclymer**: So they cancel their meeting last week with the city.
**Bclymer**: They don't have their souls report done yet, I think.
**Bclymer**: Was there a reason why.
**Bclymer**: I don't know if they've rescheduled or if it's just two weeks later.
**Bclymer**: So we don't have any movement on that one.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: A.J.
**Adelgado**: applied Engineer Office.
**Adelgado**: Romano.
**Njepson**: Did you guys just see that email?
**Njepson**: Jesse and Brandon?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, that's what made me.
**Njepson**: I don't know how we respond to that, wanting to subcontract themselves.
**Jdawson**: I mean, I would just say no, but you know what?
**Jdawson**: Well, I mean, what scopes do you guys want to take out and do yourselves?
**Jdawson**: I mean, that's.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah, like some of the scope.
**Bclymer**: What is that?
**Njepson**: Well, to me, after I didn't read the last sentence where he says, we are already working with the cubicle vendor, to me, that makes it seem like he's unaware that, you know, we don't have any FF&E in there, so maybe.
**Njepson**: Yeah, I don't know.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Are they doing the MEP drawings or who's doing those?
**Njepson**: They're doing the MEP drawings.
**Speaker 7**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: We already have a release from the state, though, for the minor scope hope, like, but they're already switching electrical stuff.
**Njepson**: I haven't touched pricing yet because they've changed it so many times.
**Njepson**: I'm waiting for a final set of construction drawings.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that's fine.
**Jdawson**: I would just would say, like.
**Bclymer**: Is he talking about wallpaper?
**Bclymer**: I know they had wall covering allowance, like the things that they have the allowances for.
**Bclymer**: Ask him that.
**Bclymer**: And Say.
**Bclymer**: Sure.
**Jdawson**: I mean, I would just say.
**Jdawson**: I would say.
**Jdawson**: I'd say.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, sounds good.
**Jdawson**: What.
**Jdawson**: What scope items are you wanting to do yourselves?
**Njepson**: Yeah, and then we'll.
**Njepson**: We'll.
**Njepson**: I'll.
**Njepson**: I'll respond on dates.
**Njepson**: That work for me for these couple ones.
**Njepson**: Okay, well, then there's the update.
**Njepson**: I mean, they just sent a review set today or comments on the original architectural drawings, and they're still working on the MEPs.
**Njepson**: So Alex put together a schedule.
**Njepson**: I haven't viewed yet, but we'll go through that tomorrow.
**Gducharme**: Okay.

**Njepson**: Just gotta find an architect.
**Njepson**: So he's chomping at the bit to get moving, so I gotta.
**Njepson**: I gotta hop on that.
**Njepson**: I sent the information to Jerome.
**Njepson**: I haven't got anything back from him.
**Njepson**: I'll probably go on thumbtack and find another architect that can get me another proposal.
**Jdawson**: You're going to go on thumbtack and hire an architect?
**Njepson**: Oh, yeah.
**Jdawson**: Why?
**Njepson**: Because this is a small.
**Njepson**: This is more of a residential thing.
**Njepson**: It's right up their alley.
**Njepson**: Someone on our thumbtack.
**Njepson**: You don't like that idea?
**Jdawson**: I mean, I'm.
**Jdawson**: I just.
**Jdawson**: I don't know.
**Njepson**: I mean.
**Jdawson**: Go ahead and try it.
**Njepson**: Yeah, I created like a burner thumbtack account, so that's how I found a plumber one time.
**Jdawson**: Nice.
**Jdawson**: Moving on.
**Adelgado**: Holding FedEx.
**Njepson**: Yep.
**Njepson**: Starting the buyout now.
**Njepson**: Sent the contract to the owners on Friday.
**Njepson**: Schedules built.
**Njepson**: Needs to be cleaned up just a tad.
**Njepson**: Me and Alex, we're gonna go around there tomorrow, start getting that process rolling.
**Njepson**: I did get the CDR on Friday.
**Njepson**: I've already sent that into Carmel permitting, so now they can start their review process.
**Njepson**: Had a couple adjustments on the drawings for dkgr.
**Njepson**: He responded to those comments today.
**Njepson**: I expect to have a bulletin set here in the next couple days.
**Jmendez**: But.
**Njepson**: We'Re moving forward with the buyout.
**Njepson**: I sent a couple Lois out last week and we'll be done with buyout here this week.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Speaker 7**: Nick Spires and Lucy working on the billing.
**Speaker 7**: And Candon put together an estimate, so I just need to review it.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: Cormar Ga.
**Adelgado**: Exotic.
**Adelgado**: Brandon.
**Jdawson**: For what?
**Jdawson**: Georgia.
**Jdawson**: Yes, I'm going through that.
**Jdawson**: Trying to balance the budget.
**Jdawson**: We still waiting on the firearm get tied in by arco.
**Jdawson**: That's kind of the main thing.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: Westfield Collective.
**Jmendez**: Yes.
**Njepson**: Concrete.
**Jmendez**: Updated concrete number came back today.
**Jmendez**: 478.
**Jmendez**: I'm kicking off their contract to them right now.
**Jmendez**: We have the storm finishing up this week.
**Jmendez**: We got our sanitary Permit today that's posted on the trailer.
**Jmendez**: We got to go ahead to get going.
**Jmendez**: Last week on it.
**Jmendez**: So they did get started, but they didn't make it very far.
**Jmendez**: We're not gonna be able to use the existing storm line lateral that we.
**Jmendez**: Or the sanitary lateral we found.
**Jmendez**: So we've been pumping out the hole out there getting.
**Jmendez**: Getting ready to get that sewer connection done so we can move the trailer and get started on the parking lot.
**Jmendez**: AG peers are still coming in later this week.
**Jmendez**: Looks like probably Thursday, Friday.
**Bclymer**: Like, what is going.
**Ataylor**: What.
**Bclymer**: Like, what's going on with, like, the interior drawings?
**Jmendez**: Interior drawings?
**Jmendez**: I don't know.
**Jmendez**: I have.
**Jmendez**: Eli, given that we gave Brandon an estimate and I don't know where we're at since then.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I mean, Eli's going to be all the finishes and stuff.
**Jdawson**: But as far as, like the interior drawings, like the walls and stuff, we already have that, don't we?
**Jmendez**: We have.
**Jmendez**: We have up, up, through what they've given us.
**Jmendez**: No, we don't.
**Jmendez**: We don't have the complete.
**Jmendez**: Finished.
**Jmendez**: Finished drawings.
**Jmendez**: Finished schedule.
**Jmendez**: No, we don't.
**Jdawson**: What about that?
**Bclymer**: I mean.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Can we finish everything but our painter and our tile guy.
**Jmendez**: From the drawing standpoint?
**Jmendez**: I mean, I think that we have pretty much that.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Jmendez**: Really the last thing is stating finishing out the doors and schedules for CIH and where the tile is going to go.
**Jmendez**: I think that everything else is kind of.
**Bclymer**: So we can complete all the subcontracts.
**Bclymer**: Like, where you at with that?
**Jmendez**: All I have left on that is finishes.
**Jdawson**: Where did you save Jeff's latest interiors drawing?
**Jmendez**: If you go to the permit set, there's two renderings in there, and then there's the permit set.
**Jmendez**: That's it.
**Jmendez**: That's all.
**Jmendez**: That's all we have.
**Jdawson**: Wait, so we don't have actual interior drawing drawings?
**Jdawson**: We have just the renderings.
**Bclymer**: Correct.
**Bclymer**: Well, then we don't have what we need.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: How do you.
**Jdawson**: How do you.
**Jdawson**: So we don't have wall types.
**Jmendez**: We have.
**Jmendez**: We have.
**Jmendez**: No, they're not.
**Jmendez**: They're not called out.
**Jmendez**: Most of them are not called out.
**Jmendez**: Some of them are.
**Jmendez**: Most of them are not.
**Jmendez**: We have all the wall types.
**Jmendez**: They're not called out.
**Jdawson**: Why not?
**Jdawson**: And when are we getting those?
**Jmendez**: I believe we are getting Those on the 16th, the 23rd.
**Jdawson**: By the.
**Jdawson**: Of May.
**Ataylor**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: Why?
**Jmendez**: Because that is when that was.
**Jmendez**: Let's see.
**Jmendez**: Lee Master is turning around their joists and their final shop drawings on the 16th and their models.
**Jmendez**: And Jeff said he would take those models and finish up all of the Interiors release them.
**Bclymer**: I mean, we have wall schedules in here.
**Jmendez**: Yeah, they put the wall.
**Jmendez**: They put walls in there.
**Jmendez**: They just put every.
**Jmendez**: Every wall.
**Jmendez**: And they're not identified throughout the plans.
**Jmendez**: So, you know, when I've been going through sub.
**Jmendez**: Sub coordinator scope reviews with people I've been know, answering to them, you know, solid surface countertop here, sealed concrete.
**Jmendez**: On the questions that they have that we know what we're going to use, but there's just no finish schedule for it.
**Jmendez**: So again, finishes and the countertops are the only two subcontracts I have left to right.
**Jmendez**: However many we break that finishes out into is.
**Bclymer**: I mean, did you write.
**Bclymer**: Have you looked at these?
**Bclymer**: Like they got the wall types here on a 101A.
**Bclymer**: So who's finishing the door schedule?
**Jmendez**: Access will have a finished door schedule.
**Jmendez**: I mean, we need cuts of the bars for how to frame these bars up how we want the bars and walls.
**Jmendez**: There's, you know, that bathroom has a big cut, a one, a 110, but that doesn't exist yet.
**Jmendez**: So there's.
**Jmendez**: It's just incomplete.
**Jmendez**: There's a lot of cuts in here that, that take you to, you know, a 103 or a 110, but that.
**Jmendez**: Those pages aren't in here yet.
**Bclymer**: But that's coming from Studio Access.
**Njepson**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Sorry, I didn't mean.
**Bclymer**: Hi, Jackie.
**Bclymer**: I'm just thinking of, like, what are the important things we need to talk about today in this meeting that you need help with or.
**Jmendez**: I mean, it's just finishes and none of it's like long lead item stuff.
**Jmendez**: If, if they need, you know, if they need an extra week or two to put the finish schedule together on the models that Lee Master is going to provide, and it makes it smoother.
**Bclymer**: Talking from your end, like to buy out a job.
**Bclymer**: We're like two months late on buying out a job.
**Bclymer**: And is it because of the drawings being late or are we missing any information?
**Bclymer**: That's all.
**Bclymer**: We just need to get to the bottom of that or you're going to be ready to paint and you still won't have a painter on board.
**Jmendez**: No, I.
**Jmendez**: I'm tracking what I.
**Jmendez**: Again, all finishes and the PO to CIH for doors and a countertop.
**Jmendez**: I didn't find a countertop person and buy that out.
**Jmendez**: I mean, we've been working with the subs.
**Jmendez**: I've been working with the subs, bidding the interior finishes throughout so that they're up to date on the changes and that we have current pricing from them.
**Jmendez**: They know the idea of where we're going to put tile and this and that.
**Jmendez**: So as soon as we get final stuff, they can make their finishes and we can contract quickly and we won't have to wait weeks for them to get us bids back.
**Bclymer**: Well, I mean, I just.
**Bclymer**: We got 10 subcontracts out.
**Bclymer**: One of the one is a surveyor, so I just.
**Jmendez**: Wait, what are you saying?
**Jmendez**: 10 subcontracts?
**Bclymer**: Here we go.
**Jdawson**: See, you gotta change your view to Show More than 10.
**Jmendez**: Yeah, there's 19 out.
**Jmendez**: Okay, well, I just sent Merit out, so there's an 18 out.
**Jmendez**: One just went out.
**Jmendez**: Fight is with you to review.
**Jmendez**: So that's the only one that's not out or approved.
**Jmendez**: After that, I'll have again countertops PO for CIH finishes.
**Jmendez**: Could be, you know, two or three different subcontracts.
**Jmendez**: But yeah, everything else is bought out.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jmendez**: Right now, I mean, we're, we're a little over a hundred thousand ahead on the unallocated costs.
**Jmendez**: And I have a big nugget in there for the flooring going from our polished concrete down to sealed concrete with this, we're about 60,000 ahead on that too.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Jmendez**: Doing pretty good.
**Jmendez**: Yeah, we're doing pretty good.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: Goodwill Corp.
**Adelgado**: Office, this is A.J.
**Adelgado**: nick.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Speaker 7**: The city made comments regarding one way drive versus the two way drive entrances.
**Speaker 7**: And also they were asking about a drainage permit and a driveway permit and who's responded to the comments.
**Speaker 7**: So we're waiting to hear back now.
**Bclymer**: I added to that too, Nick.
**Bclymer**: Like I talked to Andrew and I didn't call Hoosh back until before he emailed him.
**Bclymer**: But the city put in islands and a bike path and you can't even get two cars.
**Bclymer**: There is no in and out.
**Bclymer**: It's not even possible to safely have cars go in and out with the entrance they gave them.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: Okay, hopefully that does it and they're done.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: Siva Consulting Building, Pennsylvania.
**Adelgado**: I think this is Durham.

**Njepson**: But Steve's canceled, like, the last three meetings.
**Njepson**: Jesse, I don't know if you've noticed that.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, so.
**Njepson**: But phase two, I don't have an update on that one either.
**Njepson**: Just.
**Njepson**: Kyle's still working through his audit just like we are.
**Njepson**: So I was talking with Brandon last week.
**Njepson**: You know, whoever gets it first, at this point, we may just be using our license.
**Njepson**: What'd you say?
**Bclymer**: Not sure how he could fail that audit, but.
**Njepson**: No.
**Njepson**: No one.
**Njepson**: Did I say he failed.
**Bclymer**: Well, now he's just.
**Bclymer**: People don't respond to you.
**Bclymer**: Something's wrong.
**Njepson**: Oh, yeah.
**Njepson**: I don't.
**Ataylor**: I.
**Njepson**: Know he's busy, so.
**Njepson**: I don't know.
**Njepson**: I haven't.
**Njepson**: I haven't been pressing him a ton on it.
**Njepson**: I can press harder if you want me to.
**Bclymer**: No, I mean, I wouldn't at this point.
**Njepson**: So.
**Njepson**: I mean, he.
**Njepson**: These guys all want the work.
**Njepson**: They call me once a week, like, hey, man, I haven't got it released yet.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: But if our audit's done this week, then we'll submit as soon as he would submit.
**Bclymer**: So we could still have him do the work.
**Bclymer**: We just won't have to be.
**Bclymer**: The GC is all right, which is.
**Njepson**: Probably preferred at this point, but I know I.
**Njepson**: I would guess ours can get done quicker.
**Njepson**: I think that we have more resources to throw at our accountants than he does to get them to speed it up.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: You know, and he said.
**Njepson**: He said if his doesn't get done in time, like, he's not gonna.
**Njepson**: We had agreed on.
**Njepson**: On charging him or on him charging us to expedite the audit, but he's not gonna make us pay, obviously.
**Njepson**: So I did have that conversation with him.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: I mean, I wouldn't.
**Bclymer**: I don't know how much that is.
**Njepson**: But, like, five grand.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: Goodwill, Bart, Nick.
**Speaker 7**: Need to put together pricing for some additional requests that Goodwill made.
**Njepson**: The gift that keeps on giving.
**Njepson**: Those guys are always putting in additional requests.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: You guys at the new office?
**Njepson**: Let's go.
**Njepson**: You need to get some stuff on the walls.
**Jdawson**: Hey, Glenn.
**Jmendez**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: I just got a call from John with Westfield Collective.
**Jdawson**: He's one of the owners.
**Jdawson**: Make sure that you're ccing him on all the information like you do Mike, So, you know, Katie, Mike and John know.
**Jdawson**: Should be on.
**Jdawson**: On the correspondence.
**Jdawson**: He's.
**Jdawson**: He's saying he.
**Jdawson**: He didn't get the change order, the deductive change order, so.
**Jmendez**: Oh.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Jmendez**: Yeah, I keep him on everything.
**Jmendez**: I must have forgot to put him on that one.
**Jmendez**: But in general, yeah, I do have him on everything.
**Jdawson**: Oh, actually, he is on this one.
**Jdawson**: That's weird.
**Jdawson**: That's all right.
**Jdawson**: I'll forward it to him.
**Jdawson**: Anyway.
**Bclymer**: Nick, is our punch list done?
**Bclymer**: Other than the things they want added.
**Speaker 7**: The only thing left is the dryer vent.
**Speaker 7**: Alex needs to fix.
**Speaker 7**: He needs to add a clamp for the hose, and I think there's a filter that's coming in this week.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: Aging transcape.
**Njepson**: Yep.
**Njepson**: I was hoping you mean was going to finish the stone on Saturday.
**Njepson**: He did not.
**Njepson**: So he's been working on it today.
**Njepson**: He's got, like, 10 pieces to put up.
**Njepson**: He'll finish tomorrow, and we'll be done with the pud corrections.
**Njepson**: All I have left to do is to get this.
**Njepson**: Get this proof roll done on the path.
**Njepson**: I got a new inspector.
**Njepson**: My.
**Njepson**: My inspector that was on the job got fired, which is actually a good thing for us, probably.
**Njepson**: So I'm.
**Njepson**: I called Richard on.
**Njepson**: On Thursday, and I told him I'm scared, you know, with how soft the ground is.
**Njepson**: I was like, I know we're gonna fail for that path, so we're gonna go meet out there and take a peek at it.
**Njepson**: But right now, I have it tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.
**Njepson**: Thursday.
**Njepson**: The proof roll.
**Bclymer**: Who's doing that?
**Bclymer**: Pavement triangle.
**Jdawson**: Well, I mean, and if it's.
**Jdawson**: If it.
**Jdawson**: If it keeps failing, it's too wet.
**Jdawson**: Then again, unforeseen condition.
**Jdawson**: Crate give us money?
**Njepson**: For sure.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: Especially if it affects their.
**Njepson**: Their CEO.
**Njepson**: You know, we've done everything we've needed to do to get this done.
**Njepson**: This is the final, you know, piece as far as fulfilling the city's asks.
**Adelgado**: Oh, sorry.
**Njepson**: No, I was just gonna close out docs.
**Njepson**: I'm.
**Njepson**: I'm just.
**Njepson**: I need two more guys who finished up, so that's Providence and Gooden, and I'll have All those and send them out.
**Njepson**: Ulta, Dallas, hand and kick dash down there.
**Njepson**: We got the welding done.
**Njepson**: I know he's kind of taking it easy today and tomorrow catching up on some sleep.
**Njepson**: Welding's done.
**Njepson**: Opex, we got.
**Njepson**: We had two well leaks on Saturday.
**Njepson**: Been working through those issues.
**Njepson**: Had Ferguson out there today to see all of their bad fabrication.
**Njepson**: But we worked through that issue this morning.
**Njepson**: I think that we'll, we'll be all good to go tomorrow.
**Njepson**: As far as having.
**Njepson**: Right now, I just got pictures sent to me.
**Njepson**: We're holding over 200 psi on, on everything.
**Njepson**: And we're actually at 205.
**Njepson**: So if that doesn't pop a weld leak, I don't see anything failing here in the future.
**Njepson**: So we'll be done.
**Njepson**: And then the guys are all moving on to the CND mod demo that starts on 5 7.
**Njepson**: So I'll have electricians and sprinkler guys on site.
**Njepson**: Ken and I chatted.
**Njepson**: I know.
**Njepson**: I mean, we're slowing down out there for sure.
**Njepson**: You know, the most work that has to happen would be, you know, flying out for a day, you know, every other week to two days.
**Njepson**: Nothing that we can't handle on the phone.
**Njepson**: We made a really good showing for the welding.
**Njepson**: So as far as showing face, I think that's all we need to do.
**Njepson**: And as far as the RTU movement that we got a PO for, I'm waiting for some marching orders from.
**Njepson**: From Kelly with Ulta.
**Njepson**: I sent her a email this morning asking her what she wanted me to do because we're going to lose the RTUs if they want to get them in in May.
**Njepson**: And she hasn't responded yet.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Jdawson**: So who are you going with?
**Jdawson**: Are you going with Rogers or So.
**Njepson**: So where we left is she was going to call Rogers, their maintenance guys, because those are the.
**Njepson**: She told me I had to use them at first and I was like, that's fine, you can call them.
**Njepson**: But I gave her the idea, Brandon, of actually doing conversion kit.
**Njepson**: And those RTUs still work.
**Njepson**: They're just old.
**Njepson**: And I was like, well, what if we do a conversion kit, they're carrier RTUs and we go out the side and then pop the duct down 10 foot over and run the duct on the roof.
**Njepson**: Save them a lot of money and we don't have to do any structural.
**Jdawson**: Who gave you that idea?
**Njepson**: Rob gave me the idea.
**Njepson**: Well, Rob gave me the idea of putting the new ones out.
**Njepson**: And then I was talking with Kelly about going that route and then she said, well, the, the Units still work and I told her to send me the.
**Njepson**: The info on it and they do make a conversion kit for the existing units.
**Njepson**: When I told her that information she.
**Njepson**: She said she was going to call Charles.
**Njepson**: She was kind of pissed that they didn't think about that in.
**Njepson**: In the beginning.
**Njepson**: So I haven't heard back from her.

**Bclymer**: So we sent them that price as well.
**Bclymer**: And then Andrew called me today, and he said, now IPS is trying to blame any leak in any roof area to our new penetrations.
**Bclymer**: They're saying it's just following the roof deck to wherever.
**Bclymer**: So we got how that works.
**Bclymer**: Quality Roof was.
**Bclymer**: We just asked them to go out there today and just recheck all of our stuff.
**Bclymer**: And then they can say, no, it's not leaking from any of our stuff.

**Njepson**: I sent the plan off to Integrity to see if it's something they could do pretty cheaply.
**Njepson**: I'm not sure if it's in their wheelhouse or not.
**Njepson**: The guy said he's interested.
**Njepson**: He's supposed to be getting me pricing.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: Sunshine Plaza.
**Njepson**: Yeah, I noticed a bust in our spreadsheet.
**Njepson**: Told them not to sign the lease, so I'm glad I caught that, which is good.
**Njepson**: So I've been working on a updated price.
**Njepson**: The scope, actually job got bigger, so adding a 5 ton RTU.
**Njepson**: So I'm getting the opportunity to.
**Njepson**: To adjust the budget.
**Njepson**: And then I did a FaceTime walk with the broker on Friday.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: What's up?
**Bclymer**: Bust in the spreadsheet.
**Njepson**: If you look, none of my Division 9, so either I, I.
**Njepson**: Something got deleted.
**Njepson**: It's a budget.
**Njepson**: So it, you know, in their way, they were.
**Njepson**: They're receptive.
**Njepson**: But.
**Bclymer**: It just.
**Njepson**: That addition didn't add up.
**Njepson**: He said, hey, we're gonna go sign this lease.
**Njepson**: You know, will you check here?
**Njepson**: I said, well, it's been a while since I priced it, so let me go like, check to make sure it all checks out.
**Njepson**: And when I added it all together, it wasn't calculating in the Division 9 finishes, so it's like 30 grand was missing.
**Njepson**: I don't know where it got deleted.
**Njepson**: I don't know how it got deleted.
**Bclymer**: Happens all the time with that worksheet.
**Bclymer**: If you type something into right one of the columns, it just goes away.
**Jmendez**: I'm.
**Njepson**: Well, I'm glad I looked at it because of what you know, I, I know to check that now every time just to triple check, you know, you, you add it up manually at the end.
**Njepson**: And I did that, you know, before he went to sign the lease.
**Njepson**: And I was like don't sign that lease because it's you know, 30 grand more.
**Njepson**: So I think he's going to cover it which is awesome.
**Njepson**: But he didn't want to sign it anyway because he hadn't even put his own eyes on the space.
**Njepson**: And I was like Devon, you got to go look at this space before you sign a lease.
**Njepson**: They really like the location.
**Njepson**: So.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: GPC Harrisburg this is I think you.
