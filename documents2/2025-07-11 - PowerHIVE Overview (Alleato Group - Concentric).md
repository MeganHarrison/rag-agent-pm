## Transcript
**Evin.sisemore**: I got that one too.
**Evin.sisemore**: I just got that one.
**Acannon**: I literally restarted it like so many times.
**Acannon**: How many?
**Jremillard**: No, we don't do that.
**Jremillard**: Thank goodness.
**Acannon**: Oh, good.
**Evin.sisemore**: They send like Pat.
**Evin.sisemore**: They're like patches that they'll send to us and then you update the patch and then I, I swear I was shutting down for about 15, 20 minutes the other day and it was like late.
**Evin.sisemore**: I just wanted to close my computer and the pain.
**Bclymer**: Dang.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Acannon**: Good news is that we are secure.
**Acannon**: It's a cyber security thing, so.
**Jremillard**: I'm the worst.
**Jremillard**: I don't restart my computer but once every two months, maybe in the same.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Acannon**: That's why I'm so frustrated with the restarts.
**Evin.sisemore**: Just lock.
**Evin.sisemore**: Well, I know before, before we start.
**Evin.sisemore**: Is Brendan joining us?
**Evin.sisemore**: Brandon joining us?
**Evin.sisemore**: Jesse or.
**Jremillard**: No, he's on a flight, so.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: He's gonna miss this one.
**Evin.sisemore**: Okay.
**Acannon**: So Jesse's.
**Acannon**: What.
**Acannon**: What happened with Siva?
**Jremillard**: They decided to use a different contractor there.
**Acannon**: So I wonder if they, they knew about the power constraints.
**Jremillard**: Well, that's what I. I'm not sure what you know, because once they decided to move that direction, I kind of, you know, didn't spend a lot more time with it.
**Jremillard**: I'm more interested today meeting, you know.
**Evin.sisemore**: Learning where we could place it.
**Jdawson**: Well.
**Acannon**: T.J. is not going to be on.
**Acannon**: He's out.
**Acannon**: But just wanted to go over, I think from my understanding you wanted to go over what we did last week or the week before and just tell me a little bit about what you were trying to get from this.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, I mean, I think, you know, I got Jesse on here.
**Bclymer**: Hello.
**Jremillard**: He's a senior.
**Bclymer**: Hi, Jesse.
**Evin.sisemore**: And so just trying to learn a little bit more.
**Jremillard**: Right, right.
**Jremillard**: And just knowing what this is.
**Jremillard**: So you know, like I said, we got a job coming up architects wants us to do in New York and I, I don't even know what that involves yet.
**Jremillard**: But if there's any power, you know, if it involves the lifts and all that power, then we'd like to be able to know exactly how your systems work and how to best, you know, introduce it for this.
**Evin.sisemore**: And this is a new ground up construction.
**Jremillard**: It's also an Amazon is the, the client and you know that jobs too far past and they do have enough power in that building to make it all happen.
**Jremillard**: But you know, they were wanting to not have to pay for an extra panel, things like that.
**Jremillard**: It's just for us to know that be able to bring that up in the beginning for when they're planning I think is a good thing.
**Acannon**: Off, I mean, off the record, we know the solutions that were proposed and everything.
**Acannon**: And so that one facility is going to have some issues if it's not with power, just with runtime.
**Acannon**: You know, all these forklift companies come in and they just sell to try to get in, you know, get their product in the door and they don't really care about the big picture, it lasting and, and, and really that's where we tried to kind of separate ourselves from them so that we can be on the, the, you know, customer side and not dictated by what the forklift wants to do.
**Acannon**: And I don't think that we really got into it too much, but on the last meeting we were more focused on the hive, but just wanted to let you know that we handle everything from backup critical ups, energy storage solutions, gas power generators.
**Acannon**: We have a maintenance division.
**Acannon**: We have some other divisions that like building management systems that we can, that are very competitive and are great and help reduce the overall electrical pull and can track that.
**Acannon**: And in their smart systems where they can, you know, see in the morning, you know, the electricity is being pulled just because people keep turning on the AC and like monitoring that and just by learning little trends and things like that, they can reduce it.
**Acannon**: And then you said the Northeast, we also work with a company that works with the ERCOT and all the grid companies, and if they're at capacity or if they're at an ancillary time where they just need to reduce that peak power, they'll actually pay, like ERCOT will pay us to help to go to the customer and reduce their energy pool during those times so that they have enough power to go around.
**Acannon**: And it's really big in the Northeast.
**Acannon**: Texas, California, obviously is having a lot of struggles with power, but a lot of times it'll pay for like the gas generator.
**Acannon**: We just met with a customer the other day that was running after the fires in Chino, California.
**Acannon**: They're losing power once a month and they're having to rent a generator for like $30,000 a month.
**Acannon**: So these are all things that, that I feel like if you guys know a little bit more about it on the front end, you, you know, you can prepare that customer and be a little bit more consultative with your approach and it makes y' all look better, but these are all different areas that we can help you on, not only just the motive power side.
**Jremillard**: Okay, and you said, so you already met with the lady over at Ceda and what, how was she receptive to it?
**Acannon**: He, she was like, yeah, let's set Up a meeting.
**Acannon**: But then Greg told me that y' all didn't.
**Acannon**: We were gonna.
**Acannon**: She wanted to set up a meeting with you guys.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Acannon**: And Greg said that y' all weren't on the project, so I just kind of backed off a little bit on that.
**Acannon**: I mean, we.
**Acannon**: If y' all want to try to set up a meeting, I'm.
**Acannon**: We can.
**Acannon**: But if it's kind of a moot point that.
**Acannon**: And we need to go ahead and focus on the future, then that's fine, too.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: And then, you know, as we.
**Jremillard**: I do want to, you know, Brandon, he gets back today, and then we'll talk next week and just see.
**Jremillard**: So I still would like to, you know, get our contacts and just talk.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Acannon**: Yeah.
**Acannon**: I mean, I think that this is.
**Acannon**: Siva is notorious for having issues and batteries failing and not.
**Jremillard**: I don't even.
**Acannon**: Go ahead.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Evin.sisemore**: Oh, we're having some connection issues.
**Bclymer**: Jesse.
**Acannon**: I didn't know if that was my computer.
**Acannon**: I think it's his.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Acannon**: Jesse, Other Jesse Remillard.
**Acannon**: Is it remillard or remard?
**Jremillard**: Are you having the connection?
**Acannon**: It's kind of like the sauce Remoulade, but remoulade.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: We lost Jesse Dawson.
**Acannon**: Are you back?
**Acannon**: Yeah, I think he's still stuck in that position.
**Bclymer**: I'll text him.
**Evin.sisemore**: I hope he's not saying too much.
**Bclymer**: They all repeat.
**Acannon**: Jesse Rimillard, what do you see as being the biggest struggles that y' all are running into as far as power?
**Acannon**: It could be forklift power, you know, setting up chargers, like in the situation for Siva where there wasn't a power drop or just crazy electrical expenses, trying to get that electrical infrastructure in there, or is it backup critical?
**Acannon**: Like, what are you seeing with your customers and struggles?
**Jremillard**: Jesse, are you back?
**Jremillard**: I think so.
**Jremillard**: My camera.
**Jremillard**: When the camera's on here, it.
**Jremillard**: It'll kick me off a meeting, so.
**Bclymer**: I'll just shut that off.
**Acannon**: Pulls too much power, I guess.
**Jremillard**: We need your.
**Jremillard**: Need you to help us out with our office.
**Acannon**: We'll send a generator over.
**Acannon**: But I guess what are the biggest.
**Acannon**: Whenever you're going at these contracts, and what are the biggest struggles for y' all on power?
**Acannon**: It could be the backup side or the forklift side, like Siva, where we ran into, you know, the chargers not having enough power pull.
**Acannon**: Or adding another transformer, adding another panel.
**Jdawson**: What.
**Acannon**: What are you.
**Acannon**: You're y' all seeing.
**Jremillard**: That's usually it is the fact that, you know, this equipment takes a lot of power, and in a building like that one, where they Never planned for that in the beginning.
**Jremillard**: And so that's why these, it seems like these deals, they just pop up and then it's a rush, you know, it's all just a mad rush for them to figure out quickly how, how they can overcome the power issue and to bring in additional services and large panels.
**Jremillard**: That takes the most time.
**Jremillard**: So if, if the power solution can take the same amount of time, you don't need as much.
**Jremillard**: That's where I see the benefit of it because it, you know, fixes the issue with the power.
**Jremillard**: You can get your, you said you can get your system in what is it, three months or.
**Acannon**: Yeah, I mean if we could have a little bit more lead time, that's great.
**Acannon**: And we're, we're talking with a few companies that want like 50 of these @ a time.
**Acannon**: And so as we get busier to that lead time could go back a little bit more.
**Acannon**: But if we knew, if we have any idea of like customers that we can pre order stuff too to make that lead time go down.
**Acannon**: So even if your customer's not going to need it for like a year, if we can have a little bit of notice, we can have, make sure everything's ready.
**Acannon**: And a lot of our customers on new build, we just installed one at Performance Food Group and we went ahead and installed the arm, the electrical everything before the trucks even got there.
**Acannon**: So then once the trucks got there, that was like the second phase of the whole install where then we put the cradles and the batteries in the truck.
**Acannon**: But whenever it's a new build, we can, can, it's, it's actually even easier.
**Acannon**: Most of the time we're working with current infrastructure where we're having to tear down a system, put the new system up and keep it running the whole time.
**Acannon**: So we can do both.
**Acannon**: But new builds are very easy for us.
**Acannon**: And I think you know from the electrical specs, that's where if your customer hasn't already picked a solution like a, their power or their trucks, I mean it is a brand agnostic technology.
**Acannon**: So it doesn't really matter which trucks they are, but that's where you can go in on a bid and bring us in.
**Acannon**: And your electrical is going to be hundreds of thousands less than anyone else.
**Acannon**: And they may not even the competitor, you know, may not even know.
**Evin.sisemore**: Yeah, and keep in mind too with the new builds, it's like, I mean I'm, I know with the new customers most likely are like, hey, get as much, you know, we need to put as much inventory in this facility as possible.
**Evin.sisemore**: So there's also the fact that you can fit an extra, you know, maybe instead of going a narrow aisle in some spot, in one spot, you can, you can take it from 3,000 square feet of avail that you need of charging space down to 600.
**Evin.sisemore**: So it makes it nice with the new build to, you know, from a.
**Evin.sisemore**: From a space.
**Evin.sisemore**: Space piece.
**Acannon**: Yeah, about 650 square feet.
**Acannon**: And that includes like the drive through the extra pillars for safety if customers want them, I mean, and not power.
**Acannon**: It can power over 100 trucks.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Acannon**: But this is the.
**Acannon**: Jesse Rimilar wasn't on the last call, but this, these are the different racks that the batteries and the chargers are on and they're charging and storing.
**Acannon**: And really we only need a drop here, a drop here, and a drop here.
**Acannon**: And if we only needed one rack, this would power both the arm.
**Acannon**: One rack, one drop would power the arm and the rack itself too.
**Acannon**: So it's just so much easier.
**Acannon**: And we have customers all the time that are trying to move to lithium and.
**Acannon**: And then they have to drop all the electrical.
**Acannon**: And we've had.
**Acannon**: We've seen as much as like over $1 million on the electrical infrastructure that has had to be put.
**Acannon**: Pulled in.
**Acannon**: And so that's where it really makes sense.
**Acannon**: Jesse, do you want to see a video of the Hive itself?
**Jremillard**: I think you sent.
**Jremillard**: Someone sent me a video.
**Jremillard**: I don't know if it's the same one.
**Jremillard**: It was like a YouTube thing.
**Acannon**: Yeah.
**Acannon**: I didn't know Jesse R. Wanted to see it.
**Jremillard**: Yes, I saw that as well.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: Of the arm being used.
**Acannon**: Really our customers who are doing this, I feel like the initial one is because of either safety.
**Acannon**: They like the fact that they're completely taking the operator out of it, or it's a space constraint or it's an electrical constraint.
**Acannon**: Those are probably the what most of our customers initial things.
**Acannon**: Reasons why they went with this one.
**Acannon**: But then the other thing is the productivity that it brings.
**Acannon**: I mean, customers are seeing a minimum of 5% increased productivity.
**Acannon**: I just met with one of my customers, I think I told you the other day, they're one of the largest, like electrical manufacturing components and distributors in the world.
**Acannon**: And they were telling us that their outbound, outbound lines went up from 8.9.
**Acannon**: They were at like 8.99 per hour.
**Acannon**: And it went up to 10.1.
**Acannon**: So that's an over 10 increase.
**Acannon**: And then on the receiving, they went up over 10%.
**Acannon**: So we always give conservative numbers based off of the lowest percentage we've seen is about 5%.
**Acannon**: But I mean, there's no other technology out there that can reduce the amount of real estate that it needs, reduce truck counts because they have more uptime.
**Acannon**: They're in.
**Acannon**: They are in.
**Acannon**: Their maintenance goes down, they can reduce headcount and increase productivity.
**Acannon**: Like, there's no other technology out there that does that.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: And that's the way I see it.
**Jremillard**: It's something that obviously something new takes a while to catch on, but once it does, I think this is going to be a big.
**Jremillard**: Really.
**Jremillard**: Why wouldn't, why would anyone build differently?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Evin.sisemore**: And I guess that raises, you know, you know, we've kind of gone.
**Evin.sisemore**: We've had a couple calls now.
**Evin.sisemore**: Jesse Dawson, and kind of you, you.
**Evin.sisemore**: It sounds like you have a pretty good understanding of it.
**Evin.sisemore**: I mean, you know, from all the, from other than the technical piece.
**Evin.sisemore**: Like, are there any questions surrounding just how, how it works?
**Evin.sisemore**: What's involved us?
**Jremillard**: Yeah, I mean, so mine, when it comes to selling it, like, and that's.
**Jremillard**: Brandon's the salesman, when he goes and talks to our clients, you know, and just said, hey, if you got anything coming up that requires, you know, a space with, you know, new lifts and new chargers, like the pros of it, number one, we know the space savings, the, the battery thing.
**Jremillard**: I think I understand that you're selling the battery.
**Jremillard**: So they don't have to buy the battery from the equipment provider.
**Jremillard**: They can just buy a lift and then the, and then the power component where you take a quarter or less of the power would require to do traditional chargers.
**Jremillard**: And then they also don't have to purchase the charger.
**Jremillard**: So like, so if we could tell them you're going to pay the same amount for batteries, whether you buy them from the lift people or from the Hive, and you're exactly not going to have to buy the chargers and you're not going to pay for all this extra power to be able to PowerPoint that into like, like side by side comparison based on 10 lifts or 10 forks or 100 forks.
**Jremillard**: Like that would be if, if that document showed that real savings just side by side, right off the bat, like, that's what you know.
**Jremillard**: Because they'll understand battery costs, they'll understand charger cost and they'll understand electrical costs.
**Jremillard**: But even though they don't know how your system works, they can see the money savings and time and all that.
**Jremillard**: And that just makes it easy then.
**Jremillard**: Okay, now you got their attention and they want to look into it.
**Evin.sisemore**: Exactly 100%.
**Evin.sisemore**: That's kind of What.
**Evin.sisemore**: So what we typically do.
**Evin.sisemore**: And there's a couple other people on this call who you haven't met before.
**Evin.sisemore**: We got Jay Shaw, who's our director, he runs our national account program, runs our guaranteed power program.
**Evin.sisemore**: He wasn't on the original call.
**Evin.sisemore**: And then Amy, Amy's on our.
**Evin.sisemore**: She's on our marketing side.
**Evin.sisemore**: She's and all.
**Evin.sisemore**: Amy Black's on our marketing side.
**Evin.sisemore**: So the one thing that we've got is when we bring this to the customer, right, we go in, we do an assessment.
**Evin.sisemore**: Typically this is on a.
**Evin.sisemore**: This is on an already operational facility.
**Evin.sisemore**: We get data and then we come back and we do show a total cost of ownership.
**Evin.sisemore**: So this is the cost of what it would be if you purchase all the batteries, purchase all the chargers, purchase a changer or maybe just they're not doing changer, they're doing one to one.
**Evin.sisemore**: Yeah, exactly like this.
**Evin.sisemore**: So.
**Evin.sisemore**: So as you can see, this is a sample of what we would provide.
**Evin.sisemore**: You were the customer, which shows on the left side.
**Evin.sisemore**: This is if you do it the conventional way, the way you're always used to doing it.
**Evin.sisemore**: And then on the right hand side would be the cost of the Power Hive or guaranteed power, compared to that.
**Evin.sisemore**: So, so yeah, just to what.
**Evin.sisemore**: Where I'm going with this is you, you just, you just painted this picture of what we do.
**Jremillard**: Okay, and what does this show overall?
**Evin.sisemore**: Yes.
**Acannon**: And don't go for them.
**Acannon**: Every customer is different on the price.
**Acannon**: So don't just go in and it's, you know, this much a month or whatever.
**Acannon**: But that's where Greg was saying all the, you know, this is what they would have spent.
**Acannon**: And we go in, we did one yesterday and the customer has 10 year old batteries.
**Acannon**: That just means they're way oversized.
**Acannon**: It doesn't mean that, you know, they're just super good with batteries.
**Acannon**: It just means they're oversized.
**Acannon**: But for that customer, we divided it out by over 10 years.
**Acannon**: So all of these would be numbers that we would get from the customer.
**Acannon**: And then the batteries, the chargers, they have an extractor or changer that in there.
**Acannon**: But we have customers that don't have extractors and they're just looking to go lithium.
**Acannon**: But I mean, you look at, you know, we would put in a real estate.
**Jdawson**: You.
**Acannon**: We didn't put real estate savings in here.
**Acannon**: But I mean, there is like an electrical expense.
**Acannon**: We put all of that in here.
**Evin.sisemore**: Show that on the right side.
**Evin.sisemore**: That's on the right side.
**Evin.sisemore**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jay.shaw**: So Greg, why don't you scroll down a little bit and show the savings.
**Jay.shaw**: So the way we bucket it, we look at equipment costs versus equipment costs, which is that first bucket, that 54% savings, and then we add in, we look at how many labor hours we're going to give a customer back, and that is the second blue bucket of the 115% savings at the bottom.
**Jay.shaw**: So we just go through all the.
**Jay.shaw**: Each site is designed specifically for those, you know, different components or different truck types.
**Jay.shaw**: And then we just come back to you and show you what if you went to the Hive, what savings it would yield to you.
**Jay.shaw**: And those are typical ranges that you would probably see at one of your facilities.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Acannon**: And I don't know what your services cost, but this 9.5 million would probably put a good dent in it can help pay for your.
**Acannon**: Some of your services.
**Acannon**: But this is the productivity that's so important that we were talking about is like, hey, if we could just move two extra pallets an hour based off of all the time saved.
**Acannon**: It really adds up.
**Acannon**: And this is a conservative number for all of our customers.
**Jremillard**: So this, there's a Jay Shaw thing kind of hiding some of the screen.
**Bclymer**: This is a.
**Bclymer**: It's.
**Evin.sisemore**: Evan, you got control of this one?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: You want.
**Acannon**: What do you want me to.
**Jremillard**: Oh, it's just there's a box on the screen kind of.
**Jdawson**: Oh.
**Evin.sisemore**: Because it's all tied.
**Evin.sisemore**: A lot of this is probably tied to.
**Evin.sisemore**: It's tied to our internal workbooks, like one of Jay's internal workbooks.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Evin.sisemore**: So what we do is typically with this, when we provide this to a customer, we give them.
**Evin.sisemore**: We provide this.
**Evin.sisemore**: It's an Excel document.
**Evin.sisemore**: We give you the formulas.
**Evin.sisemore**: Right.
**Evin.sisemore**: And then the customer can input their own numbers and come up with, you know, their own roi.
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Evin.sisemore**: It's just a way to.
**Evin.sisemore**: It's a simple way to give you the form to give the customer the formula is to formulate an roi, or.
**Jremillard**: At least their own TCO on the top here.
**Jremillard**: Does that say, like, what it would cost them to replace?
**Jremillard**: So that's where it would be.
**Jremillard**: If it's a new facility, it'd be the added electrical.
**Jremillard**: So there'd be difference in electrical, difference in real estate.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Evin.sisemore**: This is simple.
**Evin.sisemore**: I mean, this is very simplified.
**Evin.sisemore**: You know, sometimes depending on if it's a.
**Evin.sisemore**: If there is electrical involved.
**Evin.sisemore**: Typically when we provide this, it doesn't include any electrical add on.
**Evin.sisemore**: But, you know, that's something we can, we can always add into the TCO just based off what, what.
**Evin.sisemore**: How we need to design it for the customer.
**Evin.sisemore**: If they're if they need to purchase, you know, an extra panel with another 50 drops and they got to spend another 300,000 in infrastructure, we can include that plus the high, plus the hive infrastructure to show the savings there.
**Evin.sisemore**: So we can design this TCO based off however you want us to to design it.
**Acannon**: I thought I had one.
**Acannon**: I was trying to look for one that I have with electrical infrastructure, but this particular customer here, they were going to have to.
**Acannon**: The electrical infrastructure that they were going to add was like 250,000 versus our solution was 60.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Evin.sisemore**: And what's nice with the new.
**Evin.sisemore**: With the new build up, you know, a ground up construction, I'm going back to the whole space issue.
**Evin.sisemore**: But, you know, now we know what we can give back as far as, you know, if they do need to want to add an extra aisle of rack, or if they do, if a customer does want to, you know, you know, build another, build some additional office space, we can show that savings as well.
**Evin.sisemore**: It makes it a little easier for us on the TCO to give you a true savings of what the building would be this way, constructed this way versus this way.
**Evin.sisemore**: You know, if you can add more inventory, obviously there's more profit there.
**Evin.sisemore**: You know, it's different if it's a cost center, but.
**Evin.sisemore**: But yeah, that's kind of an example of what we do.
**Jremillard**: So if I send you a drawing for this job we're currently doing and it'll show you the.
**Jremillard**: I think we added 30 chargers.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: For the lifts.
**Evin.sisemore**: Those are 30, 34 clips, Jesse.
**Evin.sisemore**: Total one to one.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: That they added.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And.
**Jremillard**: And then if you can just send me like that, then I can add in.
**Jremillard**: How much do we have to spend to add all the electrical and the panels for that?
**Jremillard**: And then it would be something I could just show them like, hey, here's something in the future, like if you went with this system or if you had a building where you didn't even have the power to add versus like this one where they had it, then, you know, this is an option.
**Acannon**: Do you know if the customer that has the 30 lifts, are they lithium or like around the clock operation?
**Jremillard**: It's lithium.
**Jremillard**: Trying to think if they're around the clock or not.
**Jremillard**: That I don't know.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Because find that out.
**Acannon**: I mean, we do and we sell everything from lead acid to lithium one to one to hive.
**Acannon**: This is just one of our technologies.
**Acannon**: But I think why customers love us is because we can go in and be consultative.
**Acannon**: We're not just pushing the hive on them.
**Acannon**: If we See that lithium one to one would be better because they, you know, only run eight hours a day or something.
**Acannon**: That we can be flexible with the solutions and make sure that they have the right one.
**Acannon**: But really the, like that SIVA location and we have customers as small as 24 trucks that have the hives, but knowing a little bit more about the operation, that's going to help us build the ROI and the case for them.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: And again, like I'm saying, like just to have the conversation with them now.
**Jremillard**: So, yeah, you know, the next time a project comes up that can be planned into it or they at least know what, what the option is, anything.
**Evin.sisemore**: And I'm gonna let Jay.
**Evin.sisemore**: Jay chime in here because, you know, it's one thing when we do put build a TCO based off a true assessment, but like when we're putting together, let's call this a budgetary type number, an approximate.
**Evin.sisemore**: Jay, anything else you could think of or what we would.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, we would.
**Jay.shaw**: Yeah, we would just need to know the truck quantity, what technology they bought, you know, did they lease or buy.
**Bclymer**: It.
**Jay.shaw**: Some application information like number of shifts and days per week, things like that.
**Jay.shaw**: And we can start to, you know, after we get that basic info, we might come back and ask some more questions.
**Jay.shaw**: But that would be a good starting point if you can get the detail of, you know, the truck types they bought.
**Jay.shaw**: Of those 30.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Jay.shaw**: The technology that was purchased.
**Jay.shaw**: Earship that information, we can start to show you what that comparison would look like.
**Acannon**: We can send you a little cheat sheet so you don't have to remember all that.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, that'd be good.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: And I'll shoot you over the plans for that place and you can just.
**Jremillard**: It'd be nice to see what that comparison would be because I know we had to add additional panels to do that and so.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Acannon**: Well, we appreciate, you know, you even you thinking about us and bringing us to these opportunities.
**Acannon**: We'd love to work with you more and more.
**Acannon**: I think it's a value add that you can bring your customers and we can help support you.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, yeah, no, I know.
**Jremillard**: I really like it.
**Jremillard**: So I think it's going to be something that I would like us to specialize in bringing to our customers too.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Acannon**: So we.
**Acannon**: We can also build nuclear power plants if you need us to do this for you.
**Acannon**: So just.
**Jremillard**: I don't know if we're ready to do those yet.
**Evin.sisemore**: Not ready to dive in.
**Jremillard**: I heard they got these little mini ones now they can build.
**Jremillard**: CD has developed one or something.
**Acannon**: We're a division of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, so our really other power division.
**Acannon**: So we have a.
**Acannon**: An unlimited toolbox, pretty much.
**Bclymer**: Wow.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: That's pretty awesome.
**Jremillard**: Are they building any of them in the U.S.
**Jdawson**: They.
**Acannon**: I mean, California.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, no kidding.
**Acannon**: They really.
**Acannon**: I think they're.
**Acannon**: They're bigger over in Japan and then they see it coming over to the US in the next, like, 10 years or so.
**Acannon**: But I really want to be the first one to sell a nuclear power plant at our company, but.
**Acannon**: So I'm just going to keep throwing it out.
**Jremillard**: Well, if I get any leads, I'll send them to you.
**Jdawson**: It's not a Mitsubishi one, but they are putting a SMR Small or SNR small modular reactor in Knoxville, which is where I am.
**Jdawson**: So the TVA power got the first national approval.
**Bclymer**: That's awesome.
**Jdawson**: We'll see.
**Jremillard**: It is.
**Jremillard**: We got.
**Jremillard**: We got the right administration to get that going.
**Evin.sisemore**: Look at that.
**Bclymer**: Cool.
**Jremillard**: All right, well, thanks again and.
**Jremillard**: Oh, yeah, Greg, I'll follow up or let's send it to you and I'll.
**Evin.sisemore**: Send you this email.
**Bclymer**: Jesse.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, okay.
**Jremillard**: I'll send you something good.
**Jremillard**: All right.
**Jremillard**: Thanks, everybody.
**Bclymer**: Thank you.
**Evin.sisemore**: Thank you.
