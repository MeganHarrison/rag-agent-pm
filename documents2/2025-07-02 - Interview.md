## Transcript
**Jdawson**: Paperwork, RFIs, submittals, and everything like that.
**Jdawson**: So put together schedules, working through procore, kind of getting to learn all the facets of procore.
**Jdawson**: And then, yeah, about three weeks ago, I was sent down to South Carolina, where I am now to kind of take over a project in the interim while we work through some, like, staffing changes.
**Wisslercharles**: So.
**Wisslercharles**: Okay, is that your first.
**Wisslercharles**: Have you.
**Wisslercharles**: I see you interned.
**Wisslercharles**: Were you on like a job site, interning or in an office for that company?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, during my internship, I was on site pretty much every day.
**Jdawson**: Spent a week on my primary project there in McKinney, Texas, and then I actually spent about two weeks in Sherman, Texas, which is just south of the Oklahoma border, on site as kind of a pseudo safety manager during demolition, and then after that returned to my primary, My primary project there where I was just kind of shadowing the superintendent, trying to learn as much as possible, handling some, like, geotech report paperwork and, you know, coordinating with the city on permits and everything like that.
**Wisslercharles**: What were the.
**Wisslercharles**: What was the project?
**Wisslercharles**: What were you building?
**Jdawson**: So the one in McKinney was a two building, I believe, like just about 200,000 square feet total between the two of them, like distribution, a tilt wall project.
**Jdawson**: And then in Sherman, Texas, I was working on the demo and rebuild of a car dealership.
**Wisslercharles**: Okay.
**Wisslercharles**: It's good.
**Wisslercharles**: You like it?
**Wisslercharles**: Do you like the field?
**Wisslercharles**: You like being in the office more?
**Jdawson**: I do.
**Jdawson**: I really enjoy being in the field.
**Jdawson**: I'm still, you know, I'm still fairly new in the industry, so I'm still kind of, you know, learning the ropes and learning how it does, but how everything goes.
**Jdawson**: But I firmly believe that you can't learn how to build unless you're in the field.
**Jdawson**: Like, you can't, you can't learn how building goes together from sitting behind a computer screen and checking in with guys, you know, on teams meetings and.
**Speaker 2**: Amen.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Wisslercharles**: That's right.
**Wisslercharles**: Well, like, if you're the PM and you're ordering stuff and you have no clue as to what it is, where it goes, exactly, it's a little tough to be a good pm.
**Wisslercharles**: My experience, I work for a company called MJ Harrison.
**Wisslercharles**: You know, the owner that started that, he was always the superintendent.
**Wisslercharles**: Then he started the company with his dad.
**Wisslercharles**: But, like, when you came out of, you know, we had interns, you know, once they got out of college, there was mandatory two years in the field before they could come into the office.
**Wisslercharles**: You know, in two years, they would decide whether they wanted to be in the field or they wanted to Go in the office and, you know, pursue PMing.
**Wisslercharles**: And then to become a senior PM, if you were always a PM, your career, you had to spend a year as a superintendent and it just created really the best.
**Wisslercharles**: Like, to this day, I don't know that I worked at a better company that had, you know, at the time, just great people up and down because everyone knew what everyone else was doing and, you know, what the processes were.
**Wisslercharles**: So that's good, that's good.
**Wisslercharles**: And you like Indianapolis is where you want to stay?
**Wisslercharles**: You like it there?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, like I said, born and raised in Indianapolis, I currently live in.
**Jdawson**: I live in Greenfield, Indiana, which is just to the east of Indianapolis proper.
**Jdawson**: But yeah, I'd like to stay around Indianapolis as my, my family, my girlfriend's family, as they're kind of getting older, want to be sure that we're around and be able to spend as much time with them as possible.
**Wisslercharles**: So, yeah, our office, I'm not that familiar with Indianapolis.
**Wisslercharles**: I go there every couple weeks typically, and it's right.
**Wisslercharles**: I think it's north east Indianapolis.
**Wisslercharles**: There's a mall there.
**Wisslercharles**: Is it?
**Wisslercharles**: Countryside Castleton Mall?
**Wisslercharles**: That's it.
**Wisslercharles**: It's kind of right over there.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, no, I, like I said, grew up on the north side, actually lived.
**Jdawson**: Lived in Castleton for about the time I was in middle school until about halfway through high school.
**Jdawson**: Lived over there and.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, so pretty familiar with that area.
**Wisslercharles**: Yeah.
**Wisslercharles**: And we're, I mean, we're a growing company, Alito.
**Wisslercharles**: Just give you some background on us.
**Wisslercharles**: So I work.
**Wisslercharles**: Brandon Clymer's the CEO.
**Wisslercharles**: He started Alito three years ago and we worked together at a company called DeAngelo's diamond in Florida.
**Wisslercharles**: Actually, he worked for me really, because I was a project manager there.
**Wisslercharles**: We hired him as an assistant PM and he just did great.
**Wisslercharles**: We did help work.
**Wisslercharles**: DeAngelis diamond, the Division I was in was all healthcare work.
**Wisslercharles**: So, you know, that's if you're going to learn construction, really, healthcare is.
**Wisslercharles**: Yeah, there's nothing more stringent than that.
**Wisslercharles**: They got more systems, electronic systems, like everything just.
**Wisslercharles**: And then in Florida they got a agency called ACA that does their inspections.
**Wisslercharles**: And like they look at UL listings on door transformers.
**Wisslercharles**: I mean, they're just very particular on their inspection.
**Wisslercharles**: So it just requires a lot more oversight.
**Wisslercharles**: And everyone that's on the job, you're checking, you know, you have to check everything.
**Wisslercharles**: Everyone does or else, you know you're going to fail.
**Wisslercharles**: So that's where I met Brandon.
**Wisslercharles**: You know, became friends, worked together for several years and Then I got sent off to other jobs and you know, he ended up in Indianapolis and starting his own company and he always asked me to join him.
**Wisslercharles**: So about a year ago I did and like just the expansion we've been doing is incredible.
**Wisslercharles**: And we opened a St.
**Wisslercharles**: Pete office.
**Wisslercharles**: That's where I work out of.
**Wisslercharles**: I live in Clearwater, Florida.
**Wisslercharles**: So you know, we got an office here now.
**Wisslercharles**: Several people that work out of here.
**Wisslercharles**: Jesse, he's on board now, so not sure where, you know, we got this job out in Goodyear, Phoenix area.
**Wisslercharles**: You know, maybe he'll stay out there a bit.
**Wisslercharles**: But we, we do work all over the country.
**Wisslercharles**: Like we got guys up in New Jersey, we got Dallas project, we got a Memphis project coming up.
**Wisslercharles**: Stuff in Florida, Georgia, Pennsylvania.
**Wisslercharles**: It's just all over the place.
**Wisslercharles**: You know, we do, you know, Brandon specializes, you know, he's trying to find the right person that wants to just dive into it and take over.
**Wisslercharles**: Is doing fire sprinkler systems and warehouses and the, the ASRs systems.
**Wisslercharles**: That's the automated warehouse with the robots and all that, putting the fire sprinklers in those racks and then just warehouse in general.
**Wisslercharles**: Like the job we're looking to land here in Phoenix is, you know, it's building out.
**Wisslercharles**: It's a million square foot warehouse that we're, you know, doing all the interior offices and break rooms and lighting and power for all their systems that go in there.
**Wisslercharles**: So that's a big component.
**Wisslercharles**: You know, we, we're starting a hotel, I don't know what to call it.
**Wisslercharles**: Container Project in Savannah, Georgia.
**Wisslercharles**: That design is going to start here soon.
**Wisslercharles**: You know, we got a big job.
**Wisslercharles**: Me and Jesse are working on budgets now for in Cape Coral, Florida.
**Wisslercharles**: That'll be over a billion dollar project.
**Wisslercharles**: So like we got a lot of big stuff coming up in Indianapolis, you know, Goodwill of Indiana.
**Wisslercharles**: Like we're their preferred contractor.
**Wisslercharles**: We have, I don't know if you ever heard of the Excel centers.
**Wisslercharles**: Just since I've been here in a year, we've built three of them and you know, we're currently doing a store for them there in Bloomington.
**Wisslercharles**: And we probably had five other little projects going on with them at any time.
**Wisslercharles**: So that's a big repeat client for us.
**Wisslercharles**: We're building a project called Westfield Collective.
**Wisslercharles**: There is one of another project that's pretty cool.
**Wisslercharles**: It's like indoor volleyball courts, got ex outdoor sand volleyball courts and restaurant and bars.
**Wisslercharles**: It's going to be a, it's in Westfield.
**Wisslercharles**: Yep, that's going to be a super cool project, but just a lot of different things.
**Wisslercharles**: You know, we're trying, you know, a good construction company won't focus on one thing because when that industry has a slow time, then you got nothing to fall back on.
**Wisslercharles**: So we try to be diverse, you know, in that manner.
**Wisslercharles**: So.
**Wisslercharles**: And we just.
**Wisslercharles**: We have great repeat clients.
**Wisslercharles**: It's like a handshake, and they tell us to take off and we go.
**Wisslercharles**: And, you know, it's.
**Wisslercharles**: You know, it's just.
**Wisslercharles**: It's great to be in that kind of environment.
**Wisslercharles**: We got those kind of owners.
**Wisslercharles**: So, you know, that's what we're looking for, is young people that can, you know, that want to be part of something.
**Wisslercharles**: And, you know, we're not a big company now, but we're growing so fast.
**Wisslercharles**: You know, it's a place you can certainly advance and.
**Wisslercharles**: And make a name for yourself and accompany here.
**Wisslercharles**: So that's a little bit about us.
**Wisslercharles**: And, Jesse, if you want to add in anything here.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: I will say, Chip, that this versatility.
**Speaker 2**: There's a very vast amount here to learn as far as projects go and all the different things that are coming up.
**Speaker 2**: What would you say your favorite parts of the day are as far as tasks that you do?
**Jdawson**: Well, I.
**Jdawson**: I guess depend kind of on whether, you know, whether I was in the office or being out here in the field.
**Jdawson**: From a field standpoint, probably my favorite part of the day is just being able to talk to our trade partners that are out here on site, you know, kind of picking their brain, seeing how they do their center, they do their job, kind of learning how they go about, you know, certain processes.
**Jdawson**: Even if it's something as simple as, like, connecting conduit, and it's just like, you know, I'd rather see how it's done, then I can understand kind of what goes into it from the office side of it.
**Jdawson**: Probably my favorite part of the day is.
**Jdawson**: So I start every.
**Jdawson**: When I'm in the office, I start every day by kind of making the task list for myself and just kind of like, okay, this is what, you know, these are the things that are on my radar or things that are in my court that I need to get taken care of.
**Jdawson**: And it's.
**Jdawson**: My favorite part is at the end of the day, being able to look at it and say, you know, out of 15 tasks that I kind of wrote down and targeted for myself, being able to say, you know, I got 12 or 13 of those done throughout the day and just being able to keep, you know, they're off my.
**Jdawson**: Off my Plate and tomorrow I add new stuff and just continue to keep working and keep moving forward with all that.
**Wisslercharles**: So.
**Speaker 2**: Awesome.
**Speaker 2**: Do you have anything that you dislike as far as you not like to do submittals or anything like that?
**Jdawson**: I've gotten.
**Jdawson**: I really.
**Jdawson**: I like kind of digging into drawings, you know, and trying to be able to solve, you know, when you're in the office, that's kind of all you can do is look at all the information that's ahead of you and try to help us solutions to problems that arise.
**Jdawson**: It's a little bit different, you know, being here on site because it's right in front of me.
**Jdawson**: You know, I can see what, I can see what the problem is in real time.
**Jdawson**: And then it's like, okay, guys, how do we, how do we solve this?
**Jdawson**: Where do we need to go to get past this issue to keep driving the project forward and keep.
**Jdawson**: And keep moving forward?
**Jdawson**: So I like having a challenge.
**Jdawson**: That's probably as far as.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I like, I like having.
**Jdawson**: Having a problem and trying to find a solution for it.
**Jdawson**: And then from probably the paperwork side, I've gotten pretty good at writing up change events and change orders.
**Jdawson**: So those are kind of fun to just kind of, just kind of rifle through and kind of do the, the simple math on it and put those together and make sure that, you know, all the I's are dotted, T's are crossed.
**Jdawson**: And when we present it to our client, it's like, hey, this is what the issue is and this is what we have to do to fix it.
**Wisslercharles**: So.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, it's good that you come to.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, that's very good that you come like that and not just present them problems.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jdawson**: I mean, that's kind of the role of a general contractor is to.
**Jdawson**: In my opinion, the role of general contractor is to take all of the problems that come with the building and try to solve them in the way.
**Jdawson**: In the most efficient, you know, cost effective way for the client.
**Jdawson**: So that's, that's the whole thing here.
**Speaker 2**: With liking to dig into drawings.
**Speaker 2**: Do you like writing scopes of work?
**Jdawson**: I haven't done too much of it yet.
**Jdawson**: I did a little bit while I was at Northern Michigan as a part of some of the courses that I had to do.
**Jdawson**: It's not something that I've done too much since I joined the team here at Mammoth, but I imagine that that's something that'll start to.
**Jdawson**: To kind of get put on my plate as a responsibility.
**Jdawson**: It's not something that I'm scared of.
**Jdawson**: It's just it.
**Jdawson**: The.
**Jdawson**: The one thing that I have learned in my time here is that it takes time and you have to be incredibly familiar with the drawings that you have in order to avoid scope gaps.
**Jdawson**: And I've run into that issue before.
**Jdawson**: It's like here recently, it's like, you know, whose responsibility is this?
**Jdawson**: It's like, review all the scopes and everything.
**Jdawson**: It's like, no, we just missed it, guys.
**Jdawson**: Like, we miss this and okay, how do we get past that?
**Jdawson**: Who can, who can do this?
**Jdawson**: You know, what makes the most logical sense for somebody performing the gap to work and, you know, to keep us moving forward.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, I'm well aware of your training.
**Speaker 2**: It's been a.
**Speaker 2**: It's been a minute.
**Speaker 2**: That's probably come a long ways.
**Speaker 2**: But I was in one of Mike's first classes when he started teaching there.
**Jdawson**: Gotcha.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So, yeah, he's been around for a really long time.
**Jdawson**: And yeah, it's.
**Jdawson**: I talk to people, you know, from just kind of people that I know around the country and during my internship, being down in Texas and talking to people like what the classes are like and everything.
**Jdawson**: And Northern has a very.
**Jdawson**: It's kind of an all encompassing program.
**Jdawson**: I mean, you're going to learn a little bit about everything.
**Jdawson**: And my favorite class was the Concrete class and learning kind of how concrete goes together, you know, how to make, how to mix concrete, how to do the calculations and everything, what all the testing means, how to, how to form it, how to, how to pour it and everything like that.
**Jdawson**: I mean, that was one of my favorite classes while I was at Northern.
**Speaker 2**: Concrete class has a special place with my heart, with Mike.
**Wisslercharles**: Yeah, absolutely.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, we've talked about that over the years.
**Speaker 2**: It's pretty funny.
**Speaker 2**: Thank you.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, that's all I have.
**Wisslercharles**: What kind of construction management software do you currently use?
**Jdawson**: At the moment, the main thing that we operate off of is Procore.
**Jdawson**: That's what I kind of learned it a little bit during my internship.
**Jdawson**: That's what I use every day now being at Northern, I've had to use Bluebeam.
**Jdawson**: I was, for my senior project.
**Jdawson**: I actually was the, like I designed our entire senior project through Revit.
**Jdawson**: So I've got not extensive Revit experience, but pretty decent Revit experience and putting projects and drawings together through that system.
**Jdawson**: And then obviously Microsoft Office and all of its different applications.
**Speaker 2**: Project.
**Speaker 2**: Have you used that?
**Jdawson**: Yep, yep, absolutely.
**Wisslercharles**: And did you ever help them with estimating and do they use an estimating program?
**Jdawson**: I can't.
**Jdawson**: Trying to remember what the estimating Software is that my company uses I.
**Jdawson**: A little bit on the estimating side, we've got a pretty.
**Jdawson**: We've got a pretty good team here.
**Jdawson**: So they handle that for the most part.
**Jdawson**: The way that procore is like drawings.
**Jdawson**: Scaling works in order to pull measurements off of that isn't the best.
**Jdawson**: So if I need something that's, you know, pretty precise within, you know, an inch or two, I usually just, hey, can I borrow your.
**Jdawson**: I need to borrow the program for like five minutes to pull this measurement off.
**Jdawson**: So I have something that's like concrete.
**Wisslercharles**: So.
**Wisslercharles**: Yeah.
**Wisslercharles**: And then for the accounting software, your chain, do you run everything through procore or do they use a different system?
**Jdawson**: So all my change events and everything I run through procore.
**Jdawson**: The actual accounting of the company is handled by our accounting team.
**Jdawson**: It's not something that I get unfortunately, I don't get to see that like how the X's and O's get put together on the back end with all of that.
**Jdawson**: But yeah, for, for what I do, I pretty much operate mainly through procore.
**Wisslercharles**: So.
**Wisslercharles**: But it like, do you use the budget module and.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah, we put.
**Jdawson**: I don't have to.
**Jdawson**: I don't have too much experience actually playing around with the budget and estimating tools within procore.
**Jdawson**: Those are probably like, I would say out of all of the different tools that procore has, that's a part of it.
**Jdawson**: Those are probably my two.
**Jdawson**: The two that I don't really have any experience in at all.
**Jdawson**: But invoicing, change orders, change events, submittals, RFIs schedules, putting together directories within Procore, getting users added and all of that.
**Jdawson**: I've had a pretty decent amount of practice and just kind of trial and error and figuring out how those work.
**Wisslercharles**: Okay.
**Wisslercharles**: I mean, we use like, we're phasing out procore.
**Wisslercharles**: It's just, you know, they want to charge a percentage for every dollar you do.
**Wisslercharles**: And as you get bigger, that adds up a lot.
**Wisslercharles**: So we have a system called Job Planner.
**Wisslercharles**: It's basically a.
**Wisslercharles**: A copy or want to be copy of Procore that pretty much everything set up a change event.
**Wisslercharles**: It's a change request.
**Wisslercharles**: But we do also all of our, you know, we have an accounting software that's linked to procore or not Procore but Job Planner and.
**Wisslercharles**: But we never have to get into that.
**Wisslercharles**: Like the construction management side, we do everything in Job Planner.
**Wisslercharles**: Owner billings, sub billings, change orders, like all of that, you just, you don't have to worry about it.
**Wisslercharles**: And you know, getting to know your budget, the most important Thing you can do as a project manager is managing that budget.
**Wisslercharles**: And then that's all.
**Wisslercharles**: It's right there in Job Planner.
**Wisslercharles**: And they'll, you know, you make changes in your budget there and just push them to the accounting.
**Wisslercharles**: And then it's all.
**Wisslercharles**: They're just kind of married up, which works good same way Procore, but it just depends on what version of Procore you use, whether that's fully integrated or not, so.
**Wisslercharles**: Gotcha.
**Wisslercharles**: That's good.
**Wisslercharles**: Where do you see yourself in the next five years?
**Jdawson**: Probably the.
**Jdawson**: From a professional standpoint or a personal standpoint?
**Wisslercharles**: Oh, professional.
**Wisslercharles**: Personal.
**Wisslercharles**: Both.
**Wisslercharles**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: From a professional standpoint, in the next five years, I'd like to be an assistant project manager or an assistant super.
**Jdawson**: Like I said, I firmly believe that you can't.
**Jdawson**: You can't properly learn construction from the office.
**Jdawson**: So, you know, if I.
**Jdawson**: As much time as I can spend in the field, that's where.
**Jdawson**: That's where I want to be.
**Jdawson**: That's my only real drawback with where I work now.
**Jdawson**: We do a bunch of work around the country, just nowhere that's kind of close to home.
**Jdawson**: And it'd be nice to be on a project every single day and still be able to sleep in my, you know, my own bed.
**Jdawson**: Not staying in, you know, hotels or extended stays like I've been doing for the last couple of weeks.
**Jdawson**: But for personal, I'm looking to get engaged here in the next probably month, month or two.
**Jdawson**: So I've been putting kind of the final touches on all of that and would like to like to be a homeowner within the next five years.
**Jdawson**: That kind of be.
**Jdawson**: Kind of be the goal.
**Jdawson**: And then starting, you know, beginning to expand my own family.
**Wisslercharles**: Okay.
**Wisslercharles**: I mean, something like our PMs here, like in Saint, you know, St.
**Wisslercharles**: Peter office.
**Wisslercharles**: Down here, you know, they work out of the office and then once a month they'll fly to a job site or wherever that job is, just to do a monthly review of the, you know, project site.
**Wisslercharles**: You know, that's something.
**Wisslercharles**: Would you have an issue with that kind of travel?
**Wisslercharles**: You're just wanting to mainly be in the home office and travel occasionally for probably like three days, four, sometimes out of town.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I mean, that would, I would say, you know, probably the most ideal situation from like that, that project management level, you know, being in the office and being, you know, travel two days here and there to kind of see where the project's at.
**Jdawson**: But I would say for like the immediate future, you know, if I can do something that's kind of hybrid.
**Jdawson**: You know, be able to be on a project, you know, three days out of the week and then be in the office for two of them.
**Jdawson**: Or whether, you know, if it turns into a situation where it's.
**Jdawson**: I'm on the project the entire time, you know, as long as it's not.
**Jdawson**: As long as I can, I can stay close to home.
**Jdawson**: That's kind of one of my biggest things at the moment, just being able to, you know, be home and not have to be away for weeks at a time.
**Wisslercharles**: Yep, yep, I understand.
**Wisslercharles**: I got tired of that, but it took 20 years for me to get on doing that, so.
**Wisslercharles**: Yeah, I guess.
**Wisslercharles**: Yeah, I mean we had two.
**Wisslercharles**: It's almost like a hybrid role or a pm.
**Wisslercharles**: You know, some of the smaller projects we have around Indianapolis, you're almost managing both.
**Wisslercharles**: You know, we have a superintendent that in Indy that goes around to the man.
**Wisslercharles**: I mean he's got like eight jobs now.
**Wisslercharles**: He's running around too.
**Wisslercharles**: You know, just kind of keeping them all checked on.
**Wisslercharles**: We got.
**Wisslercharles**: And then we got full time people on job sites.
**Wisslercharles**: So, you know, that's something that we can look at.
**Wisslercharles**: What is your time frame?
**Wisslercharles**: Like what do you, what are you looking to make a decision on?
**Jdawson**: I'm not looking to make a decision, you know, within the next week or anything like that.
**Jdawson**: Just kind of put putting the feelers out there.
**Jdawson**: The, the situation that I'm in right now just isn't.
**Jdawson**: I don't think it's going to work out for me long term.
**Jdawson**: So just trying to kind of get ahead of the game before, you know, becomes a really an untenable situation.
**Jdawson**: But yeah, I mean, probably within the next month, month and a half is when I'd like, you know, kind of like to have a decision and begin looking to transition to a different opportunity.
**Wisslercharles**: Okay.
**Wisslercharles**: I would like, like go back to the, you know, in college and I guess Jesse, you could tell me too, like what, you know, I've worked with a lot of people that went to different, you know, building science universities and some of them told me, well, they didn't really teach me anything about construction.
**Wisslercharles**: Does Western Michigan.
**Wisslercharles**: Do they take the time because like do they dive into how to do change orders and how to do, you know, things like that that are actually related to the job or is it mostly a lot of just learning different court classes that are not specifically about construction?
**Speaker 2**: Well, when I was there.
**Jdawson**: So yeah, go ahead, Jesse.
**Speaker 2**: Mike and Daryl were the teachers there and both came from the field.
**Speaker 2**: Mike came, I think Mike came from Mortenson and Darrell came from somewhere big and they basically taught like you were on a project.
**Speaker 2**: So they detailed everything, you know, right down to the means and methods.
**Speaker 2**: It was basically like superintendent and PM learning experience.
**Wisslercharles**: You know, if they were from Robbins and Morton, then.
**Wisslercharles**: I know exactly, because that was MJ Harris, they were Robins and Morton people.
**Wisslercharles**: And then a lot of people they hired were all from Robinson Morton.
**Wisslercharles**: So.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, and Darrell was a residential guy, so it was more of that end for him.
**Speaker 2**: But yeah, but as far as that, you know, a lot of what you said, Chip, I can see it in where you learned it.
**Speaker 2**: So it's kind of a full circle.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I mean, so the beginning of the course you get into it.
**Jdawson**: It's, you know, one of the first classes I have you take is just kind of like reading drawings and being able to understand drawings and you know, just kind of start with the basics and then as you kind of move through, you know, learn a little bit more about concrete little learn a little bit more about soils and soil testing.
**Jdawson**: You know, there's an entire class that's on MEPs and understanding how those all go together.
**Jdawson**: And as you kind of start to advance, you get, you know, design.
**Jdawson**: One of the classes, they just call it like the shed building class.
**Jdawson**: And for an entire semester you're on a, you're on a team within like your hour and a half block and you're working with, you know, two or three other teams that are solely working on your shed and coordinating, you know, the work that has to be done and taking pictures and tracking that and then moving up to, you know, design with Revit having to go through and you know, the first class is just kind of following the Revit textbook and we're going to build a hotel and this is how you do X, Y and Z.
**Jdawson**: And then moving up and at one point I had to design like a, A like walk up build like residential housing in New York.
**Jdawson**: So, you know, you've got 50, you know, the lots 50ft wide by, you know, 140ft to the back of it.
**Jdawson**: And here's your footprint for where what needs to be in here.
**Jdawson**: You know, xyz grandma's living on the bottom floor and then, you know, floors two, three and four for the, the family itself.
**Jdawson**: And they want to see, you know, ABC inside of that.
**Jdawson**: And then I actually.
**Jdawson**: So in addition to designing my senior project where we actually designed, built, the entire thing just was a small, like screened in patio, but for a different.
**Jdawson**: It was, remember exactly what it was called.
**Jdawson**: But essentially we got together at a team at.
**Jdawson**: As a team at the start of the semester.
**Jdawson**: And what you're working on is you're essentially trying to.
**Jdawson**: They give you a spot around Marquette, Michigan and they're like, hey, you need to develop a business that's going to go here.
**Jdawson**: You know, this is what it's owned for.
**Jdawson**: You know, we had to figure out what the zoning is for what we could put there, couldn't put there.
**Jdawson**: And then we had to.
**Jdawson**: We ended up deciding on like a hotel resort.
**Jdawson**: So I had to.
**Jdawson**: Once again, I was kind of the guy who was designated as the revit.
**Jdawson**: Hey, you know, you got to put this thing together.
**Jdawson**: This is as a team.
**Jdawson**: This is what we kind of want to see.
**Jdawson**: So here's our, you know, two dimensional floor plan for it.
**Jdawson**: Put that thing together and it turned into like a pretty standard cabin that can house, you know, six to eight people for a weekend or you know, an extended stay and then a hotel that had its own kind of bar and restaurant attached to it.
**Jdawson**: So the further along you get in the course, the more it becomes not just about what construction is, but really what the industry as a whole does and all the different facets of it and from design build to CM at risk to just, you know, your standard general contractor and how those pieces all fit together.
**Jdawson**: So yeah, I would say Jesse's absolutely right.
**Jdawson**: It's a little bit of superintendent and project management and everything like that.
**Jdawson**: I never wrote, you know, never put together an actual change event or change order, but I knew what they were while being in the program.
**Jdawson**: So by the time I got to actually got into my job, it was pretty easy to just, you know, transition and pick up how Procore works through that system.
**Speaker 2**: Do you still survey the bike path?
**Jdawson**: No, no, I didn't have to survey the bike path or anything like that.
**Jdawson**: They had us.
**Jdawson**: We just.
**Jdawson**: The Jacob, the Jacob Eddy center is what we are surveying off of.
**Jdawson**: Pulling off of the bolts on the light poles.
**Jdawson**: Yep, yep, the bolts on the light poles and shooting different trees and everything like that.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Wisslercharles**: Nice.
**Wisslercharles**: Well, that's good.
**Wisslercharles**: Well, I appreciate you taking the time to talk to us and yeah, we'll talk to Brandon.
**Wisslercharles**: He gets back next week.
**Wisslercharles**: He's out of the country and just see where, where their next position works best in Indy.
**Wisslercharles**: But we, we're looking for someone to start up there in that office.
**Wisslercharles**: So.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, would it be like a project engineer type role or is this, you know, more of an assistant project manager that just.
**Wisslercharles**: It's all depending on you.
**Wisslercharles**: You Know, obviously, you don't want to start out over your head, and then you don't have the expectations you can fulfill.
**Wisslercharles**: So, you know, starting out as a project engineer there, you know, AJ Is the project exec for that office.
**Wisslercharles**: And, you know, he's overloaded right now, needs someone to help him manage all these projects he's got going.
**Wisslercharles**: So.
**Wisslercharles**: And he's a good person to learn from and he'd be working there every day with him.
**Wisslercharles**: And then sure, he'd be going out to the job sites that we have there around Indianapolis where those projects are going.
**Wisslercharles**: So if that, you know, if it works out.
**Wisslercharles**: And I don't know what is, like, what is your salary expectations or.
**Jdawson**: At the moment.
**Jdawson**: At the moment, I.
**Jdawson**: Base salary is 65,000 a year with some kind of bonus incentives.
**Jdawson**: That's all kind of percentage based.
**Jdawson**: I'd like to be, you know, right around.
**Jdawson**: I'd like to be at 65,000 at least.
**Jdawson**: Kind of the way that my personal life is set up and finances and everything like that, you know, I'd like to be able to maintain that same base salary.
**Wisslercharles**: They give you a vehicle allowance or anything in addition?
**Jdawson**: Nothing.
**Jdawson**: No, nothing like that.
**Jdawson**: Like I said, my.
**Jdawson**: My position is primarily in the office.
**Jdawson**: You know, while I'm down here.
**Jdawson**: They've been taking care of my.
**Jdawson**: My rental car and.
**Jdawson**: And where I say so.
**Jdawson**: And then a pretty AM as well.
**Jdawson**: But.
**Wisslercharles**: Yeah.
**Wisslercharles**: Yep, that's pretty.
**Wisslercharles**: That's standard.
**Wisslercharles**: Like.
**Wisslercharles**: Yeah, for us.
**Wisslercharles**: The same way.
**Wisslercharles**: What do they give you for per diem?
**Wisslercharles**: Just what is your opinion right there?
**Jdawson**: You have 50 a day.
**Wisslercharles**: 50 day.
**Wisslercharles**: Okay, so that's good.
**Wisslercharles**: We got that beat.
**Wisslercharles**: So.
**Jdawson**: That'S.
**Jdawson**: That's what I.
**Jdawson**: That's kind of the vibe that I picked up from just talking to people that I know from around the industry.
**Jdawson**: It's kind of like.
**Jdawson**: That's.
**Wisslercharles**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Kind of below industry standard at this point.
