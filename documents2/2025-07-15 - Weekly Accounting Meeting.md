**Accounting**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, it's a Spanish.
**Bclymer**: Do you speak.
**Bclymer**: You're in the Philippines, Fritzi or Tagalog?
**Accounting**: Yeah, it's Tagalog.
**Jdawson**: But.
**Accounting**: There are parts here that they also speak Spanish because we've been colonized by Spaniards.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.

**Bclymer**: Okay?
**Bclymer**: I'm gonna share it and you guys let me know.
**Bclymer**: Let me just have it here in case we need to adjust it.
**Bclymer**: They were waiting on Brandon and Fatima said she's running late because.
**Bclymer**: What.

**Bclymer**: One second?
**Bclymer**: We have an agenda now, so we'll see how it goes.
**Justin**: Beautiful.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so you guys, if you feel again that we need to add, change anything, let me know.
**Bclymer**: So financial overviews.
**Bclymer**: This is just a test.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so how everything with Fatima is running late.
**Bclymer**: But how is everything with the current budgets?
**Bclymer**: Revenue summary.
**Bclymer**: Is there any outstanding invoices, receivables free?
**Bclymer**: Jose.
**Justin**: So the biggest thing with that the current budget status is is do we have everything entered correctly in our budgets?
**Justin**: Jose, I know we talked about that yesterday.
**Jmendez**: Yes.
**Jmendez**: We were working with Fatima and.
**Jmendez**: And Glenn and to review on.
**Jmendez**: On the issues he has reported.
**Jmendez**: But yeah, we are still working on that.
**Jmendez**: But yeah, running on that.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Justin**: Make sure that we're, you know, obviously checking all the jobs.
**Justin**: Right.
**Justin**: We want to make everything sure it's all accurate.
**Jmendez**: Okay.
**Justin**: So revenue and expense summary.
**Justin**: So that's.
**Justin**: What does that mean?
**Bclymer**: I mean, it's just.
**Bclymer**: I mean if it's something about expenses or anything, maybe we should change it to also per diem free chain that you are actually managing that as well.
**Bclymer**: Even though I have a like a section of view of timesheets, we can get rid of it.
**Bclymer**: This is just, you know, like to redefine the agenda.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Justin**: All right.
**Justin**: Outstanding invoices and receivables.
**Justin**: So where are we at on.
**Justin**: Is everything getting coded?
**Justin**: Is there stuff that's not like, do we have stuff that's in people's queue?
**Jdawson**: Richie, do you have any pending items?
**Accounting**: Yes, for the invoices.
**Accounting**: I have current invoices.
**Accounting**: Yeah, I'll just make have a follow up with them.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Justin**: So is there.
**Justin**: Is there any overdue or is it just current?
**Justin**: You're waiting on PMs to code it.
**Bclymer**: There are current.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Justin**: So whenever you go through that, like in the, you know, that line item, we should say you should be able.
**Justin**: Every week that should be populated with like, you know, any overdue invoices, you know, you know, something like that.
**Justin**: Like that way we can see what that looks like.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: We have progress and closing task issues or delays in terms of like quarterly.
**Bclymer**: You know, if it's something.
**Bclymer**: I mean, maybe we can get rid of this one because we have.
**Bclymer**: I put a chromatica notion at the end.
**Bclymer**: So let's look with the next one.
**Bclymer**: Let the next one go.
**Bclymer**: So maybe we'll get rid of these ones.
**Bclymer**: Okay, guys, for the quarterly closing updates.
**Bclymer**: Unless you prepared this list.
**Bclymer**: Maria.
**Bclymer**: You did.
**Jdawson**: You prepared.
**Accounting**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, but this is just a test.
**Bclymer**: We can just add change, whatever you guys think it's, you know, like we need to change stuff.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So the first ones are.
**Bclymer**: Okay, the quarterly closing updates.
**Bclymer**: We can take it off accounts payable and receivable.
**Bclymer**: Review of pending payments, vendor issues or concern client billing updates.
**Bclymer**: Something related to the guys.
**Accounting**: Yeah, I still have one pending that is not sync from Job planner to Akomatica.
**Accounting**: I have already followed that one to aj.
**Bclymer**: You said a pending invoice for aj.
**Bclymer**: It's.
**Accounting**: It's actually a sync issue.
**Justin**: Sink issue.
**Accounting**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, it's a check.
**Jdawson**: A payment related issue where we need to enter a credit in procore to kind of net it to what it needs to be.
**Jdawson**: But he can't.
**Jdawson**: And what he's asking us to do, I don't think we need to do it that way.
**Jdawson**: So franchise and I have a meeting after this call to kind of figure out the best way to resolve the issue and get them paid the final balances.
**Justin**: All right.
**Justin**: Perfect.
**Bclymer**: Okay, perfect.
**Bclymer**: Vendor issues or concerns.
**Bclymer**: Nothing related to that.
**Bclymer**: Or client billing updates.
**Bclymer**: Something about that.
**Jdawson**: No, I think we're good on that.
**Jdawson**: Jesse, you had mentioned something about AJ and one more billing.
**Fireflies**: Yeah, it's a radial job that they finished it, but they're just going to bill it this month at this point.
**Fireflies**: Okay, but I think of that list.
**Fireflies**: Have we confirmed everything else?
**Fireflies**: Accounting shows that we build all those projects.
**Fireflies**: Fatima, based on that spreadsheet.
**Jdawson**: Based on the spreadsheet, yes.
**Fireflies**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Thank you, Fatima.
**Bclymer**: Payroll and compliance update.
**Bclymer**: That's me.
**Bclymer**: Everything with payroll.
**Bclymer**: I just got a call with Alex asking related if the allowances are being taxed, which I say no.
**Bclymer**: But we are checking with Angela and then yeah, Alec and Jesse are ready.
**Bclymer**: The only person missing is Alec to be in the Payroll system because his legal name is Alexander and he was put on the system as Alec.
**Bclymer**: So I requested a change of the name, otherwise he won't be able to have his i9 updated.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: Working on that, but other than that we're good on payroll processing.
**Bclymer**: Everything.
**Bclymer**: Good, thank you.
**Bclymer**: Go ahead.
**Justin**: You need to.
**Justin**: You need to take care of that 401k stuff I sent you.
**Bclymer**: Yes, yes I will.
**Bclymer**: I asked Angela also to.
**Bclymer**: Not Angela, to Brianna, to check that.
**Bclymer**: And also Brandon, they're helping us with the move from the retirement plan.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Justin**: Yeah, that's the 401k.
**Bclymer**: Yes, that's a 401k.
**Bclymer**: So I asked them already to check that because we need something specific from them as like agreeing that they are going to receive our people.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: And Social Security numbers and everything.
**Bclymer**: So working with Brianna on that.
**Bclymer**: So that's it.
**Bclymer**: That's on my side.
**Bclymer**: Now we have acumatica, so.
**Bclymer**: So is there any pending track sanctions issues?
**Bclymer**: Delays?
**Jdawson**: Go ahead.
**Accounting**: Sorry.
**Accounting**: Yeah, yesterday we have that current main that was already resolved.
**Justin**: Did you get that check cut?
**Accounting**: I'll cut that today.
**Justin**: Okay, great.
**Jdawson**: I was going to say that we noticed that some of the issues that Job Planner had previously noted as resolved are still happening on one on Westfield, Westfield Collective.
**Jdawson**: Glenn highlighted an invoice that when synced into Acumatica is going under actual cost instead of his direct cost.
**Jdawson**: So we will be reaching out to acumatic, I mean Job Planner again to.
**Justin**: Make sure that the actual cost.
**Justin**: You mean sub cost.
**Jdawson**: No, it's a direct cost.
**Justin**: Yeah, I know, but you said it's being entered as an actual cost but it should be a direct cost.
**Justin**: So that's the same thing you're saying that it's being entered and it's showing up as a sub cost, but it should be an expense, AKA a direct cost.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, it's coded right in acumatica.
**Jdawson**: When it comes to Job Planner it's not showing up under his direct cost at the end of the line.
**Jdawson**: That last line item, it's there as an actual cost and it's still showing him that he has that whole the budget available when he doesn't.
**Justin**: Okay, makes sense.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So we'll continue reaching out to them, make sure that that gets resolved.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Thank you, Fatima.
**Bclymer**: So that was.
**Bclymer**: You're working on that?
**Bclymer**: Any delays?
**Bclymer**: Jose, anything else on the transactions with Akumatica?
**Bclymer**: Everything is fine.
**Jmendez**: Oh yeah, I am looking in notion all the May transaction approved.
**Jmendez**: So I will.
**Jmendez**: I expect to have them upload in a cumatic today or tomorrow at least and then yeah.
**Jmendez**: We will have May completed and then we will begin to review all the coding for June.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Jose, let me know when May is done, because I'm waiting for that to be able to.
**Jdawson**: And Brandon, some stuff.
**Jmendez**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Brendan, I have a suggestion.
**Jdawson**: On the notion approvals, the credit cards.
**Jdawson**: Do you think we should make the final approver the project manager?
**Jdawson**: Like, let's say you have items on your card that you coded to Glenn's job.
**Jdawson**: Do you think we should make him the final approver just to make sure he doesn't come back and say this doesn't go here or somebody else?
**Justin**: No, if, if me or Jesse code some of our transactions to anybody's job, they're not going to come and say, no, that's not approved.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Justin**: If they have a, if they have a question, right?
**Justin**: If they're like, if, if they question transactions and they say, hey, what's this?
**Justin**: What's this?
**Justin**: What's this?
**Justin**: You can easily look it up in, in accounting or in Notion and say, oh, Brandon coded these things to your job.
**Justin**: But we're not, Jesse and I are not going to submit things and have an A. PM approve it.
**Justin**: Like, no, like we're the ones that approve the cost.
**Justin**: So, okay, they code it.
**Justin**: It all goes into the leadership dashboard.
**Justin**: We market this stuff as approved for Jesse and I stuff.
**Justin**: We don't need anybody else to approve ours.
**Justin**: We'll market approved ourselves.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Fireflies**: But the PM's will.
**Fireflies**: They approve their own stuff.
**Justin**: They, they mark theirs as coded.
**Justin**: And then it goes into our leadership dashboard where you and I can go in there and mark it as approved.
**Justin**: So you and I, Jesse, are the only two that actually approve transactions right now.
**Justin**: So everybody else codes theirs and then it goes to our leadership dashboard where it's got all the information filled out.
**Justin**: Now if they don't have a receipt or something like that, accounting is supposed to automatically kick it back to them so that all you and I are doing is going in there and saying, yep, it's got.
**Justin**: We agree with this job.
**Justin**: This, this, this approved.
**Justin**: Right.
**Fireflies**: So I'm going through right now and I have a shitload of them and they're.
**Justin**: Are you on, are you in the leadership dashboard or are you on your own?
**Fireflies**: Yeah, leadership.
**Fireflies**: Okay, I got to go through and approve all these.
**Justin**: Yeah, I mean, yeah, none of these.
**Fireflies**: Have any of these hit the job yet or they haven't because it's not approved yet.
**Justin**: If it's not approved.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So what if they come back and want us to now the one to a different Costco.
**Justin**: The ones.
**Justin**: The ones that you're looking at, Jesse, they should say coded under status.
**Justin**: Does it say that?
**Fireflies**: It says uploaded to whatever.
**Fireflies**: And they're.
**Fireflies**: All the codes are in there.
**Justin**: If it says uploaded to Acumatica, then it's done.
**Fireflies**: I don't have to.
**Fireflies**: Oh, okay.
**Fireflies**: I don't have to go in and approve all these, correct?
**Justin**: Yeah, if it says uploaded, I'll.
**Justin**: After this call, I'll get on a teams call with you.
**Justin**: I think you're looking at the wrong screen.
**Fireflies**: Well, it says CC transactions to approve on Leadership Dashboard.
**Justin**: Right.
**Justin**: And so if it says.
**Justin**: If the status says uploaded to Acumatica, it doesn't need approved, it's already uploaded.
**Justin**: So it has to be some kind of issue with the filter because it shouldn't show up.
**Justin**: Only the things that should show up are things that say coded.
**Justin**: So maybe it just.
**Justin**: A filter got changed.
**Justin**: So I'll look at it here after this.
**Fireflies**: It says status update needed is the filter.
**Fireflies**: I think.
**Justin**: Yeah, that's.
**Justin**: I'll.
**Justin**: I'll look at it after this and see, because it's not right.
**Justin**: Everything that on our Leadership Dashboard should just say coded is the status.
**Justin**: Nothing else should show up.
**Fireflies**: I'll change all these back to uploaded to Acumatica.
**Fireflies**: So that's what they were.
**Justin**: Yep.
**Justin**: So, Fatima, your question to.
**Justin**: If they want to move it, that's fine.
**Justin**: If they.
**Justin**: If.
**Justin**: If I coded it to whatever travel and they like, well, you know, this is blah, blah or whatever, fine, that doesn't matter.
**Justin**: But, you know, we're not gonna.
**Justin**: They're, you know, they're gonna, you know, again, like, just like software costs, right?
**Justin**: Like, it's like.
**Justin**: Yeah, we guys, we have.
**Justin**: We incur software costs.
**Justin**: It's going to hit your job.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Thank you, guys.
**Bclymer**: Jose, who is missing on credit card transactions?
**Bclymer**: Did Brandon finish his or.
**Bclymer**: Who needs to work on it?
**Justin**: Oh, no.
**Jmendez**: Once approved, I need to work on downloading and then upload into Akumatica.
**Justin**: That.
**Jmendez**: That's on my end.
**Bclymer**: Okay, perfect.
**Justin**: I'm through May.
**Justin**: I just got to do June.
**Justin**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: It's his fault.
**Bclymer**: You can't blame him.
**Bclymer**: Okay, sounds good.
**Bclymer**: You have to finish that.
**Bclymer**: Okay, calendar.
**Bclymer**: How are we doing on the calendar for accounting?
**Bclymer**: Everything good in Notion?
**Bclymer**: Everything is updated.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Justin**: All right, so do me a favor.
**Justin**: If we've got an accounting calendar, I want you to print a PDF of it and send it to Jesse and I so that we can review.
**Bclymer**: It actually is here on the.
**Bclymer**: What is my.
**Bclymer**: One second.
**Bclymer**: What is notion here?
**Bclymer**: It's A notion, but I'll send it to you guys so you can review it.
**Bclymer**: I just want to make sure.
**Bclymer**: Jose, you're entering everything.
**Bclymer**: Remember that this is a tool for you guys just to make sure everything is up to date in terms of payments.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And we're not missing, you know, insurances or anything, so that's important.
**Bclymer**: So it's here.
**Jdawson**: Speaking of insurance, Brandon, do you have to approve that payment, that auto pay every time?
**Jdawson**: Because I don't know why it got kicked back.
**Justin**: No, only.
**Justin**: No, I only have to approve an auto pay once if it's, you know, like.
**Justin**: So, like for instance, like you guys.
**Justin**: Right?
**Justin**: So you guys have a payment id.
**Justin**: And so I approve it the one time and now that payment ID is already approved.
**Justin**: Now, if.
**Justin**: If for some reason a different insurance company, like, or whatever, a subsidiary or whatever, they might have different pay IDs, then yes, I would have to approve a new pay id.
**Justin**: But as long as the pay ID is the same and I approve a.
**Justin**: You know, I can put a limit on it.
**Justin**: Right.
**Justin**: So like.
**Justin**: But no.
**Justin**: Did we just try to pay one again?
**Justin**: It got kicked back.
**Bclymer**: No.
**Jdawson**: So last week, I think you were out.
**Jdawson**: Lisa sent us an email saying the insurance payment was declined.
**Jdawson**: But a couple of days later, a couple of days prior, we got a receipt saying, okay, payment, you know, processed and it looked fine.
**Jdawson**: So I don't know what happened and why it got kicked back.
**Jdawson**: So I had to go in and process another payment manually.
**Justin**: All right, yeah, send me the information on that and I'll look into it and get into the bank account and see what's going on.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So I only see here on the calendar just the credit card codings that we created with Fatima.
**Bclymer**: What else do you guys need to enter on the calendar?
**Justin**: Guys, it needs to show.
**Justin**: That thing needs to show when sub billings are due, when owner billings are due.
**Justin**: Yeah, upload to accommodate PSRs.
**Justin**: All the.
**Jdawson**: I have those dates, Maria.
**Jdawson**: I'll send those to you.
**Bclymer**: Okay, perfect.
**Bclymer**: So we can add them and we can add them here on the accounting calendar on Notion and also on the regular one.
**Bclymer**: Okay, what else is missing so we have quicker and such as calling timesheets.
**Bclymer**: Fritzi, how are you doing on timesheets, per diem's expenses, extra stuff, everything good on your side?
**Accounting**: I have already asked them to update, so we'll be sending.
**Accounting**: Might be today or tomorrow for.
**Bclymer**: Please remember that on Wednesdays we have to send everything to Venture in case something is missing.
**Bclymer**: So I can double check all the time their payroll and make sure.
**Bclymer**: Everything is fine.
**Bclymer**: So let's do that on Wednesday so we have that.
**Bclymer**: So don't forget your timesheets.
**Bclymer**: Other than that.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, any quick check ins with Brandon, Fatima, Fritzi, Jose that we need for him to sign to Sarah, Send something.
**Bclymer**: Not my end, no.
**Jdawson**: Nothing.
**Jmendez**: Not on my end.
**Bclymer**: Not on your end?
**Bclymer**: On my end, no.
**Bclymer**: Or good too.
**Bclymer**: Already working on Venture.
**Bclymer**: No.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Whenever you have the time, please print the thing that I send you for the California Surety bond that Lisa is working on.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: They need three signatures.
**Justin**: The one I.
**Justin**: The one I sent you, I got assigned three.
**Justin**: Two other times you're saying yes, correct.
**Bclymer**: So I send you the last one.
**Bclymer**: So sign three times, that's it.
**Bclymer**: And just send it to me.
**Bclymer**: Okay?
**Justin**: Okay.
**Justin**: All right, we'll do.
**Jmendez**: Okay, guys, I have an additional item, but this is related to payroll upload into Akumatica because we still don't have goodwill Tremont and Radial Marinesville in Acumatica created yet.
**Jmendez**: And this is important because we need to upload the payroll into Akumatica.
**Jmendez**: I think so.
**Justin**: What?
**Justin**: Who is it?
**Justin**: Who is it that's coding to Tremont and.
**Jmendez**: 25 108?
**Justin**: No, no, I know the code.
**Justin**: I'm saying who is it in the company?
**Justin**: What's the.
**Justin**: Who are the people that are coding to Tremont, encoding to.
**Jmendez**: Oh yeah, let me see.
**Jmendez**: I have the payroll.
**Justin**: But so, so pull those and, and send it to Jesse and I, or you know, and we will.
**Justin**: We will move those to a different job.
**Jmendez**: Excellent.
**Jdawson**: So we're not supposed to have any payroll on those jobs yet.
**Justin**: Yeah, because those jobs haven't hit yet.
**Justin**: So like, I know it's like we had.
**Justin**: We had like.
**Justin**: Mike probably went out there.
**Justin**: I think Mike went out there.
**Justin**: He's probably one of them.
**Justin**: So we're just going to move his time to Uniqlo and then the other one is probably Tremont, is maybe Nick or Andrew.
**Justin**: You know, if it's Nick, we're just going to move that to Bloomington.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so that's why I did not answer.
**Justin**: They're not.
**Justin**: They're not.
**Justin**: They're not official issued jobs just yet.
**Justin**: We haven't set them up yet.
**Justin**: Unless.
**Justin**: Unless Jesse.
**Justin**: Martinsville, we.
**Justin**: I mean we.
**Justin**: Maybe that one we can push.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Fireflies**: I don't know.
**Fireflies**: Martinsville.
**Fireflies**: It's gonna start, but I don't know when.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Justin**: Yeah, I mean if we, if we, if we know that one's coming and then we can just go ahead and push it, set the job up and, and we can get some, you know, we can have cost hit that.
**Justin**: That's okay.
**Justin**: But I would still go ahead for.
**Fireflies**: Someone just code to the wrong job.
**Justin**: Yeah, I'm sure it's Mike from when he was out there, which we can just move that to Uniqlo.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Jesse, do you want to start seeing the payroll allocation before we push it through?
**Jdawson**: Would that be helpful?
**Fireflies**: If it's a summary, yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, it will be a summary.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Jose, can you add that.
**Jdawson**: Can you add that to the list?
**Jdawson**: We can look at it what format we want to.
**Jdawson**: If you want.
**Accounting**: Jesse, I'll show you that you only need the summary.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Before we load it into acumatica, he needs to approve it.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Something else, guys.
**Bclymer**: That are we missing that should be added to the agenda.
**Bclymer**: Fatima, usually something we need to run now.
**Bclymer**: Good.
**Jdawson**: No, yeah, I'm.
**Bclymer**: I'm.
**Jdawson**: I think this is good.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: If it's missing something, let me know so we can adjust it.
**Bclymer**: But this is just like the first agenda.
**Bclymer**: We can go through things quickly and make sure everybody knows what they're talking about.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Accounting**: I have this.
**Accounting**: Sorry.
**Accounting**: I have this vendor.
**Accounting**: He just emailed me that he didn't receive yet the check dated June 6.
**Accounting**: Is it possible that he did not receive it yet?
**Justin**: I don't know.
**Justin**: I mean, it depends on.
**Justin**: I would think he would receive it by now, but it very well could have been lost in the mail.
**Justin**: We just need to reprint it.
**Accounting**: Yeah, because he was asking if he can reprint and send it again.
**Justin**: Yeah, we can just send the info and we'll get it reprinted and sent out.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Justin**: All right.
**Jdawson**: Both.
**Jdawson**: And cache it.
**Jdawson**: Because we've had that happen before.
**Jdawson**: Do what we need to avoid it.
**Jdawson**: Reissue a new one.
**Justin**: No, we're gonna.
**Justin**: No, because we're gonna print the same check number, so you.
**Justin**: They won't be able to cash them both.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we had an issue earlier this year, right.
**Jdawson**: Where they tried to cash both with the same.
**Jdawson**: The same check number.
**Jdawson**: Right, Fritzi?
**Accounting**: It was not in cash.
**Accounting**: If the same check number, it didn't work.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Justin**: Cool.
**Fireflies**: Did they ask for a third one?
**Fireflies**: Because the second one didn't work.
**Justin**: Hell, I feel like we're a finance company.
**Justin**: Half time.
**Justin**: All right, sounds good.
**Bclymer**: Okay, thank you, guys.
**Bclymer**: I'll share this agenda with you guys.
**Bclymer**: Okay?
**Fireflies**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Thanks, Maria.
**Bclymer**: Bye.
**Jdawson**: Bye.
