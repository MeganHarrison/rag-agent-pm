## Transcript
**Aelkarrimy**: Good, thanks.
**Bclymer**: I didn't recognize it when I came into the office this morning.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, no, it was Kevin when he first got on the call.
**Jdawson**: And then I was like, oh, wait, it's Kevin.
**Aelkarrimy**: Oh, God.
**Bclymer**: Going on.
**Bclymer**: Are we waiting for anyone else to join or do we got everyone here?
**Kevin.ly**: I think we're good.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I think we can get started.
**Jdawson**: We got you, Suke.
**Jdawson**: We got Joe, Cody.
**Jdawson**: I don't see Brian wager just yet.
**Kevin.ly**: Just given like two minutes.
**Aelkarrimy**: Looking for.
**Kevin.ly**: My phone and my phone is in my hand.
**Bclymer**: I have the same problem sometimes.
**Jdawson**: Jesse, while we wait for Brian to join, why don't we just run through the meeting minutes and then I think we.
**Jdawson**: I don't know if Joe or Cody have anything to just go over when it comes to the electrical output and the email that went out.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right, good.
**Bclymer**: Nice to get that wrapped up.
**Bclymer**: Cabot, you're going to share your screen?
**Mparsons**: Yes.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: So last week we talked mostly about the change orders and we have made changes to them and we have separated some of the items.
**Mparsons**: The credit is in one change order and the rest are the other two options.
**Mparsons**: We have separated them.
**Mparsons**: And for job site updates, we finished the installation of the new high B lights and those are all up.
**Mparsons**: And we don't have anyone on site this week.
**Mparsons**: The electrician is coming back on Tuesday and they're bringing more, more material with them and they will start installing the feeders.
**Bclymer**: Can Mike run through that?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So we'll have the electricians back on site Tuesday and that's when we'll begin our running our feeders from the main power distribution to our area.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And I'll also be meeting with our plumbing sub and we're looking at.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: We're looking to get that started the following Monday.
**Bclymer**: So, Mike, this schedule that you've gone on with the.
**Bclymer**: The contact on site for Uniqlo, like that plan, have you sent out any, like a little mini schedule of that work?
**Bclymer**: Is that going to happen inside the room or is that in that passage?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I've been communicating with Ted our end of the building, and we're not going to be in anybody's way.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And as we're, you know, as we're going, I'll be able to gauge and communicate with him exactly when we'll be in the area where he can assist with blocking off with cones and whatnot so we can run our lines.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: But we've been in communication this week and last week.
**Bclymer**: But that's all.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: But that's all I have for on site right now.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And Yasuke, have you talked to your team there?
**Bclymer**: Are they all comfortable?
**Bclymer**: They.
**Bclymer**: Do they need anything else from us?
**Bryan.wagar**: I want to confirm like how much of the space you need for the aisle right there.
**Bryan.wagar**: Like Mike said, you're going to coordinate with Ted, right?
**Kevin.ly**: But yes, still I have a little.
**Bryan.wagar**: Concern about like how many widths you're going to need for running the cable from powerhouse to defense inside.
**Bryan.wagar**: It's not big.
**Bryan.wagar**: It's not big area.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bryan.wagar**: It's like around 4 to 3 meters width aisles.
**Aelkarrimy**: Right, Right.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: We're looking at being right in the center of that aisle with our lift and have.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: There'll be a little room to maneuver on both sides.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: That way, if anybody needs to get around, they can.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And I'll make sure that before we even get outside of our gate that I again walk with Ted and communicate with him and let him get.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Get.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Let him get a look at it before we get outside of our gate.
**Bryan.wagar**: Actually, during our operation, we need that aisle.
**Kevin.ly**: So.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, please make coordination with Ted in a little bit in detail.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Mike, if you can.
**Jdawson**: Just so then Yusuke understands what's.
**Jdawson**: What's acceptable or not acceptable.
**Jdawson**: If you can.
**Jdawson**: Once you have discussions with Ted Chesky, if you can just follow up with an email with the like what you asked him and what was the direction that was provided by Ted Chesky.
**Jdawson**: This way you took knows that the warehouse is aware.
**Jdawson**: They're okay with the approach, and this way we can avoid these concerns.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Will do.
**Aelkarrimy**: Will do.
**Aelkarrimy**: Thank you.
**Bclymer**: And Mike, you're going to be back on site Monday morning.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Tuesday morning.
**Aelkarrimy**: Tuesday morning.
**Aelkarrimy**: Correct.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: This week we sent out billing for some of the work and the material that we have received, we have sent that over.
**Bclymer**: And it's just the monthly pay application.
**Bclymer**: So that's for the electricians and everything that happened for the month of June.
**Mparsons**: Right.
**Mparsons**: And as of now, the materials were ordered for plumbing, and we also added some of that under billing.
**Mparsons**: And for the schedule next week, we are starting the.
**Mparsons**: The feeder installation through the 28th.
**Mparsons**: And then the next thing to follow would be the panel installation and the 29th.
**Mparsons**: As long as everything stays the same.
**Jdawson**: Kevin, you saw Cody's email with regards to certain panels that should be on pause just until final confirmation is supplied, correct?
**Mparsons**: Yes.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Because I think some of those.
**Jdawson**: The LE1 panel and another panel is.
**Jdawson**: It might be affected or impacted.
**Jdawson**: So we're just waiting on that direction.
**Jdawson**: Just wanted to make sure.
**Kevin.ly**: You're not ordering anything.
**Mparsons**: Yeah, we.
**Mparsons**: We haven't.
**Mparsons**: We haven't ordered anything new until we get any confirmation on what direction we are going.
**Bclymer**: So which panels are you talking about, Ahmed?
**Jdawson**: Let me just pull up Cody's.
**Mparsons**: You're talking about this email.
**Mparsons**: This one.
**Jdawson**: So we have the LEA, the TLE, the TLE 10, and the TLE 5.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: I'm sorry, not the TLE.
**Jdawson**: So these are the ones that should be on pause in red.
**Bclymer**: Right now.
**Jdawson**: I see that they've confirmed these, but I would rather wait till.
**Jdawson**: And that's what I asked.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: Just what.
**Bclymer**: What that means.
**Bclymer**: Like, you know, we have the panels, the original breakers.
**Bclymer**: Like, all of that's ordered.
**Bclymer**: So that's why it reflected in those two orders.
**Bclymer**: If we do make a change.
**Bclymer**: That was the ad for that upsize breaker, whether it's, you know, the one size or the other.
**Bclymer**: So, like, all those panels have already been there.
**Bclymer**: They've been procured.
**Jdawson**: So when you present the change order after this, after the meeting minutes, let's.
**Jdawson**: Let's make sure we just say.
**Jdawson**: All right, so this was ordered.
**Jdawson**: So if we need to upgrade this panel, this is the net and then the switches, etc.
**Bclymer**: Right?
**Aelkarrimy**: Yep.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Bryan.wagar**: All right, Kevin, I'll give it back to you.
**Aelkarrimy**: Great.
**Bclymer**: So we good with all submittals?
**Bclymer**: Is there a revision for the fire sprinkler that needs to go in?
**Mparsons**: No.
**Mparsons**: Well, that's.
**Mparsons**: Submittals are good.
**Mparsons**: The only one that's pending is the electrical right now.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: I think that's all we had.
**Bclymer**: I guess if we want to go through the change orders.
**Bclymer**: Unless you guys have something you want to talk about other than that.
**Jdawson**: Kevin, when you set the electrical submittal one, that.
**Jdawson**: That's on.
**Jdawson**: On job planner, the 527.
**Jdawson**: Or are we on pause and then that's going to be revised?
**Mparsons**: Yes.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay, got it.
**Aelkarrimy**: And.
**Bclymer**: Sorry.
**Bryan.wagar**: I'm sorry, Jesse, go ahead.
**Bclymer**: Well, I was just gonna say.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Kevin's just talking about, like, when we decide if we're gonna upsize transformers or the upsize the wire, we'll submit whatever that is to you.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yep.
**Bryan.wagar**: So those submitter will have to go for DOB again.
**Bryan.wagar**: Or we don't have.
**Jdawson**: Towards the end, we might have to just submit an AS built back to the dob reflecting all changes.
**Jdawson**: This way, whatever they see on their system is what's on site.
**Jdawson**: So that will be like.
**Jdawson**: We call it a PAA in New York City.
**Jdawson**: So we will amend the set at the end of the project.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Bryan.wagar**: So we don't have to go once more again before the construction starts?
**Jdawson**: Oh, no, no, no.
**Jdawson**: So as long as the calculations Add up and everything is compliant.
**Jdawson**: We're still proceeding.
**Jdawson**: And then at the end of the project, any changes that occurred, we just need to reflect that clouded and put a revision delta on it with a net, with a narrative.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: The inspectors here, they like, they're not looking at a drawing.
**Bclymer**: They just look for like code compliance of the installation.
**Bclymer**: So whatever size wire it is, they, they don't look at that.
**Bclymer**: They're just going to look that it's secured properly and things like that.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Bryan.wagar**: And a question to Mike.
**Bryan.wagar**: Did you, did you set about.
**Bryan.wagar**: You're using the center of the aisle for pulling the table cable from powerhouse to fence?
**Aelkarrimy**: Correct.
**Bryan.wagar**: Center of.
**Aelkarrimy**: Dial.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And obviously the lifter, it doesn't take a.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I can get the exact measurements for you, but it's, it doesn't take up much space.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So there's going to be room on both sides to maneuver around.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I mean, I've seen some people walking through.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I, I know you say that it's operational, but I, I've seen some people walking through there and then some people on the, like the pallet jack lifts and we'll be able to, you know, get out of their way if we need to or they can get around.
**Bclymer**: So Mike, they're going to leave all the spools in our are fenced in area.
**Bclymer**: Correct.
**Bclymer**: So they'll just be the lift pulling them across the ceiling and the support.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Aelkarrimy**: Correct.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yes.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah.
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So yeah.
**Bryan.wagar**: Please share us the space, exact space you're using in the center of the aisle.
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay, understand.
**Bryan.wagar**: And one more thing is relocation of the light for plan A and B and additional lights for planning A and B is finished.
**Aelkarrimy**: Correct?
**Aelkarrimy**: Is it?
**Aelkarrimy**: Correct?
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay, so no more lights.
**Bryan.wagar**: Lights work remains.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: That's right.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And Mike, those, those lights that are in the immediate Skypod area are on a manual.
**Aelkarrimy**: Sweet.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: They, no, they, they're, they have the sensors so that any movement they're.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: They're turning on.
**Jdawson**: Well, yeah, but, but we were supposed to.
**Jdawson**: I think if you look at the electrical drawings, all the lights that are within the fenced area are supposed to remain dark even when the Skypod robots are moving, which will cause movement motion.
**Jdawson**: Those lights are not supposed to turn on unless there's a servicer who opens up the gate and flicks on the switch.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: There's the three switches there, Mike, we.
**Aelkarrimy**: Went over, we talked about.
**Jdawson**: So there are three manual switches.
**Aelkarrimy**: Perfect.
**Aelkarrimy**: Gotcha.
**Jdawson**: So those lights, just to confirm, those lights will not be on a.
**Jdawson**: Well, they won't be on a sensor or the sensor is not active.
**Jdawson**: At least only in the immediate fenced area of the Sky Pods.
**Bclymer**: If they were drawn that way, then they will definitely operate that way.
**Bclymer**: I can confirm that.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah, we'll.
**Aelkarrimy**: We'll confirm that.
**Aelkarrimy**: Thanks guys.
**Aelkarrimy**: Here.
**Mparsons**: All right, so we can.
**Mparsons**: If until unless someone asks anything, we can start looking at the change orders.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: So this would be the first one.
**Mparsons**: That's the credit for the two transformers that we were able to cancel from shipping.
**Kevin.ly**: Okay.
**Kevin.ly**: So first question I have is just.
**Kevin.ly**: This is just a straight credit, Correct.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Kevin.ly**: So this can be applied to either of the trans.
**Kevin.ly**: Either of the other two options, right?
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: Perfect.
**Aelkarrimy**: That's what.
**Kevin.ly**: That's how I took it.
**Kevin.ly**: I just didn't want to.
**Kevin.ly**: I didn't want to assume anything.
**Kevin.ly**: So what are what two transformers is this.
**Kevin.ly**: What is medium voltage?
**Mparsons**: Which.
**Aelkarrimy**: Which two.
**Kevin.ly**: So these are two that.
**Kevin.ly**: It's not necessarily returned.
**Kevin.ly**: These are two that just were ordered that didn't get delivered yet, correct?
**Mparsons**: Yes.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: They were able to stop the factory from actually canceled.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So it's.
**Jdawson**: But they did deliver the two.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So you're going to have two extra transformers sitting around somewhere at the end of the day if we don't use the other two.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah.
**Mparsons**: And that's the 245 transformers.
**Aelkarrimy**: I have.
**Mparsons**: Attached a spec on here.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Kevin.ly**: Credit for two return 45 transformers.
**Aelkarrimy**: Perfect.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: So this is the option for.
**Mparsons**: If we are connecting to.
**Mparsons**: Connecting the trans.
**Mparsons**: The conveyors directly into power without the transformers.
**Mparsons**: The only thing we would have to upgrade supply would be the feeders and the required breaker for that.
**Mparsons**: But this is one of the.
**Mparsons**: One of that.
**Mparsons**: One of the options.
**Bclymer**: So we put on there.
**Bclymer**: We listed.
**Bclymer**: He figures it's 1100ft of wire if the.
**Bclymer**: If the transform or rather the equipment connection point stays the same as the drawing you sent.
**Bclymer**: So as long as that doesn't.
**Aelkarrimy**: The.
**Bclymer**: Initial spec wire you're going to have.
**Bclymer**: I think it was similar linear foot that you'll have extra left over at the end of the job as well.
**Bclymer**: And then you'll have the two.
**Bclymer**: Three.
**Bclymer**: Is it.
**Bclymer**: Three spare 75amp breakers as well.
**Mparsons**: And this one is the option for upsizing the transformers to the 1 to 112.
**Mparsons**: And this would be the price for providing 3.
**Mparsons**: 3 of the 112 transformers.
**Mparsons**: And we would also provide the feeders to go with it.
**Mparsons**: 1200 linear foot and the appropriate breakers to go with it.
**Bclymer**: I think this is a type of.
**Bclymer**: He said these were 400 I think KCM feeders because of.
**Bclymer**: And That's.
**Bclymer**: I think we.
**Bclymer**: We should have had that from our.
**Bclymer**: From our electrician.
**Bclymer**: I think there was a comment about the feeders would have been okay the way they were.
**Bclymer**: I just don't want there to be confusion on it, and we need to clarify that.
**Bclymer**: Keba, you need to make sure.
**Bclymer**: Because I'm pretty sure that's what he said they have to be to feed these new transformers.
**Bclymer**: So we'll fix that on this document, make sure it's listed correctly for what he's providing.
**Kevin.ly**: And I think asking all these questions and really diving into it, the first quotes we can.
**Kevin.ly**: We can just forget about.
**Kevin.ly**: They're probably just put together in a panic because we all needed it quickly.
**Kevin.ly**: I do understand.
**Kevin.ly**: But, yes, these.
**Kevin.ly**: These numbers are a hell of a lot better than the last numbers.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, it's.
**Bclymer**: It's you going back and forth and, you know, trying to make sure everyone's on the same page.
**Bclymer**: So I appreciate you guys understanding that, but this is bare bones what we need to make either of the changes, and we're fine.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And if you like, I thought you mentioned it's possible the transformers may move.
**Bclymer**: That's the only thing I'd be concerned with.
**Bclymer**: When we order this wire, like, if you think they might move 50ft, let you know.
**Bclymer**: We'll order an extra 50ft on it.
**Bclymer**: And it's a minimal cost at this point, so I don't know, are we.
**Bclymer**: If you just tell us, like, we're finalized with the locations, that would be important before we go ahead and order anything.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Kevin.ly**: I'm gonna let Jody go over that in his email just so everybody's aware.
**Kevin.ly**: We are leaning, of course, towards the cheaper option here.
**Kevin.ly**: That is nice that it's 14:5, I believe.
**Kevin.ly**: And then if we apply the $7,000 credit, that really makes it 7:5.
**Kevin.ly**: Am I saying that correctly?
**Bclymer**: That's correct.
**Aelkarrimy**: Perfect.
**Kevin.ly**: Okay, so we're talking about $7,500 here.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Kevin.ly**: You are on this call.
**Kevin.ly**: I think those numbers are definitely a lot better.
**Kevin.ly**: Um, I just want to reiterate as we talked on our call last week, that, you know, that other 60K that, you know is.
**Kevin.ly**: Is not going away, that's just something that is a scope of work that Exotech is absorbing themselves.
**Kevin.ly**: So I just, I.
**Kevin.ly**: I think this number is fair enough to say that if this is the route we are going and if there are no changes moving forward, I think it's, you know, Exotech is absorbing the scope of stepping down the power, which is something we will be doing.
**Kevin.ly**: For our machines, it's just going to fall on our electrician or the third party mechanic or electricians.
**Kevin.ly**: And I think that 7500 is.
**Kevin.ly**: Well, fair enough to.
**Kevin.ly**: I mean, what's your thought on that?
**Kevin.ly**: We could talk after this, but you know, for Uniqlo to be able to pay the 7,500 and Exotect will pick up the rest of the scope.
**Kevin.ly**: We can, we can talk about that after.
**Kevin.ly**: We don't have to talk about that on.
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jdawson**: Because there's a few items, Joe, that.
**Kevin.ly**: We got to talk about after this again.
**Kevin.ly**: And then I want.
**Kevin.ly**: Cody.
**Kevin.ly**: Cody, if you can share the email you sent out.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah.
**Bschwartz**: I think we already covered some.
**Bclymer**: Of it, but.
**Bschwartz**: Is it okay if I take the screen from you?
**Bclymer**: Gaba?
**Mparsons**: Yeah, go ahead.
**Bschwartz**: So this is the email itself.
**Bschwartz**: Like I said, we kind of talked about it in the sense of what's staying and what's not.
**Bschwartz**: Well, what's changing and what's not changing.
**Bschwartz**: So TE 6, 3, 7 and 4, those are all the ones around the Skypod system.
**Bschwartz**: Specifically those are going to be staying.
**Bschwartz**: We're going to be keeping those transformers.
**Bschwartz**: It's going to be the 480 drop to the transformer, the spec of it.
**Bschwartz**: The specifications aren't going to change, so all the values are going to stay as is.
**Bschwartz**: The only conveying power box that we have that we don't believe is going to be changing is going to be the inbound one.
**Bschwartz**: There is no transformer for that.
**Bschwartz**: That will just be a straight drop to the power box.
**Bschwartz**: And the specifications aren't going to change there either.
**Bschwartz**: But as we've talked about, all of the outbound power boxes are going to just be straight 480 volt drops.
**Bschwartz**: That's confirmed.
**Bschwartz**: But to the values that we are going to need in terms of like wiring and KVAs and things like are still up in the air.
**Bschwartz**: So we'd just rather not confirm to anything before, you know, just doing it too early and then messing something up.
**Bschwartz**: But otherwise attached to that email is also this PDF.
**Bschwartz**: So the PDF also just kind of shows the same thing.
**Bschwartz**: Anything that's in one of these green little bubbles is basically us saying like we are confirmed with this.
**Bschwartz**: And anything in the red little bubbles, which is basically all at the bottom, is just saying hey, let's not.
**Bclymer**: And the breaker may need to be upsized possibly potentially.
**Bschwartz**: I can't.
**Aelkarrimy**: I don't.
**Bschwartz**: I have a feeling that it probably won't.
**Bschwartz**: But I'd rather not do anything until we are 100% understanding of what we're going to be doing because we think that in terms of what we currently designed, that maybe we might use some less equipment and maybe we're able to go down instead of upsizing as much.
**Bschwartz**: So I'd rather just be careful, be cautious and not do anything too soon.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And one thing just to keep in mind, it actually takes longer to get a breaker than to get a panel with all the breakers in it.
**Bclymer**: I think there's about a four week difference in lead time.
**Bclymer**: So instead of eight weeks, it's 12 weeks for the, the actual breakers.
**Bclymer**: These separate ones we're ordering.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Bschwartz**: But yeah, in terms of the email I sent out, that's basically all this covers.
**Bschwartz**: So unless there's any other questions that.
**Bclymer**: Kind of covers this and yet any idea like when that will he wrapped up.
**Kevin.ly**: It was supposed to be, well, the decision on what direction to go, the timeline was to be done by the end of this week.
**Kevin.ly**: Uniglo's box provider has kind of thrown us a curveball.
**Kevin.ly**: And one final idea that very well could work to keep everything as is.
**Kevin.ly**: They said they'll have finalization on if it's possible on Tuesday of next week or Monday or Tuesday of next week.
**Kevin.ly**: And then we hope to have samples by the end of the week to confirm whether or not it works or not.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Kevin.ly**: So all of this is actually, you know, being determined by Goriot boxes.
**Jdawson**: So, Joe, do you think we'll have a final direction by like the 14th or 15th of July?
**Kevin.ly**: I mean, yes.
**Kevin.ly**: I mean, heaven, heaven forbid.
**Kevin.ly**: Yes, it has to.
**Kevin.ly**: We have to.
**Kevin.ly**: There, there, there's no way.
**Kevin.ly**: If this drags further than that, it's going to delay the entire project.
**Kevin.ly**: And that is that I.
**Kevin.ly**: The entire project goes live in August with a final acceptance in November.
**Kevin.ly**: And, and that just if that goes into the holidays, as far as we know what Uniqlo does makes, you know, shirts and their retail store.
**Kevin.ly**: And I, I don't think they can.
**Kevin.ly**: I don't know what would happen if that, that date slipped into the busiest season they do all year.
**Kevin.ly**: So we are doing everything to keep the timeline by all means necessary.
**Kevin.ly**: There is a reason why they wanted to do provisional acceptance, which is kind of the soft go live in August.
**Kevin.ly**: And that is to make sure we get out all the bugs and cakes prior to their busy season.
**Aelkarrimy**: So.
**Kevin.ly**: Moving everything back is not an option.
**Kevin.ly**: And yes, and I know you sent me that email yesterday, Ahmed, and it's just I want to have good news for you and I want to say.
**Kevin.ly**: I know, I know Trust me, I want to.
**Kevin.ly**: More than anything, I don't want redesign this.
**Kevin.ly**: I don't want to get new vendors and different equipment.
**Kevin.ly**: This is purposely designed right now for what we have, we feel would be the highest power consumption of what is.
**Kevin.ly**: If this does get redesigned, we believe the power consumption would actually go lower.
**Kevin.ly**: So.
**Jdawson**: Well, I think if you, if we have a direction by the 14th or the 15th, eight weeks from that, let's say from the 15th is September 9th.
**Jdawson**: So if we are able to get a direction by the 15th and we can place orders within that week of the 15th of the 14th or the 15th, we should still be okay with the timeline for ordering the transformers because then that'll be eight weeks as like the worst.
**Aelkarrimy**: Correct?
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah, correct.
**Kevin.ly**: And, and, and to be honest, worst case, worst case scenario, and I'm not trying to drag this out or anything, worst case scenario is, hey, electric, as far as power, when it can be turned on is delayed.
**Kevin.ly**: I don't know how that, you know, affects all of the scope that, you know, that doesn't have to do with the Skypod system.
**Kevin.ly**: But that would also mean that we, as the exotech, I would have to change my commissioning schedule.
**Kevin.ly**: And when, you know, things can start getting turned on and tested and power, you know, our panels get put in and things of that nature.
**Kevin.ly**: And it, I want to avoid doing that at all cost.
**Kevin.ly**: But delaying a little bit is, you know, from your end, I don't know what it affects, but from our end, it, it just means we have to start moving things back and reorganize.
**Kevin.ly**: I'm just saying the, the original dates that Alianto is going off of, our dates that I gave them, saying I want power on by X.
**Kevin.ly**: And I think that would, that would honestly be a rescheduling between Basaliato and Uniclo.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: I'm just worried about like the GC's change order if the time.
**Kevin.ly**: Exactly.
**Jdawson**: That's the only thing that I'm worried about.
**Aelkarrimy**: Correct.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So it's just a matter of getting the box company to get you what you need, test it, and then we move on.
**Kevin.ly**: It's a matter of if the box company can deliver what we need and if they can't, we need to go.
**Aelkarrimy**: With a different solution.
**Kevin.ly**: That the Box company will still develop.
**Kevin.ly**: But it's something we know that works, but with what they're trying to do.
**Kevin.ly**: What we're trying to do with the boxes is something that to our knowledge is not done anywhere else.
**Bclymer**: It's unique.
**Kevin.ly**: It's very unique.
**Kevin.ly**: And the Tolerances are very tight.
**Aelkarrimy**: And.
**Kevin.ly**: Cardboard wants to bend how cardboard wants to bend.
**Aelkarrimy**: So.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Keba, what about the other change orders from last time?
**Jdawson**: I know we had a few.
**Jdawson**: I know that the fire alarm conduit one went away, but what about the power for the pneumatic power box as well as the oil separator?
**Mparsons**: Yeah, the power to pneumatic was.
**Mparsons**: Was actually included.
**Mparsons**: I think there was a confusion on.
**Mparsons**: On our end with the electrician, because that was originally included in our.
**Mparsons**: Our bib.
**Mparsons**: So that.
**Mparsons**: That's why that's not here anymore.
**Mparsons**: What is the other one you asked about?
**Jdawson**: The oil.
**Jdawson**: There's the oil separator.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, he split that.
**Bclymer**: We split that up.
**Bclymer**: If he didn't send it to you, he.
**Bclymer**: He just needs to get that sent over to you.
**Aelkarrimy**: I gotcha.
**Bclymer**: The outlets and data that went away and I.
**Bclymer**: That's what I emailed you last week when we hadn't got that together yet, to just let you know that went away.
**Bclymer**: So right now it's just that separator.
**Aelkarrimy**: Got it.
**Mparsons**: Yes, I'll send that over today.
**Mparsons**: Actually, I do have the oil water separator 1.
**Aelkarrimy**: That was it then.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, those were the only.
**Mparsons**: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
**Jdawson**: We already went through this.
**Jdawson**: You said this one's eliminated.
**Jdawson**: This was included.
**Jdawson**: We talked about the oil water separator.
**Mparsons**: You're just going to send that one.
**Jdawson**: Back and then the power data rough in.
**Jdawson**: We're good there as well.
**Aelkarrimy**: All right.
**Aelkarrimy**: Awesome.
**Bryan.wagar**: Oh, sorry.
**Bryan.wagar**: Ahmed, how about the power supply?
**Bryan.wagar**: Like power outlets to the air compressor is.
**Bryan.wagar**: It is already included in the power pneumatic, Correct?
**Jdawson**: That was included.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: I think that's not included.
**Jdawson**: Yusuke, that came in from the local.
**Jdawson**: HJ is the oil separator.
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay, noted.
**Bclymer**: I think we're good.
**Aelkarrimy**: That.
**Jdawson**: Joe and Cody make this work, man.
**Jdawson**: 15th need the answers by the 15th.
**Jdawson**: And I think we're.
**Jdawson**: We're still golden.
**Jdawson**: And I'm.
**Jdawson**: I don't think there will be any sort of issues with timeline.
**Jdawson**: It's just that when it hits after the week of the 15th, that's when I.
**Jdawson**: I can see like a week out of delay, probably.
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah, I mean, it's the same for us.
**Kevin.ly**: I mean, some of our equipment is 32 weeks to 36 weeks, and that puts us close, you know, not counting the holidays, that puts us in mid March.
**Kevin.ly**: And you know, our timeline has all equipment installed by end of March.
**Kevin.ly**: So I mean, we're butting up to.
**Kevin.ly**: I think the.
**Kevin.ly**: The two timelines are basically the same critical path at this moment to get.
**Kevin.ly**: Get these decision.
**Kevin.ly**: Okay, Well, I appreciate it, y' all.
**Kevin.ly**: Thank you, Aliato, for really digging into the.
**Kevin.ly**: The change orders here.
**Aelkarrimy**: These.
**Kevin.ly**: Yesterday was a.
**Kevin.ly**: Was a sticker shock for sure.
**Kevin.ly**: Or last week.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, no, yeah, we'll.
**Bclymer**: We'll just separate everything now.
**Bclymer**: Sometimes, like, you know, we just lump everything together because it's all part of one thing, but.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, because the electrician gave you it all together.
**Jdawson**: And he loves to put things together.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: He does.
**Bclymer**: And then, you know, just being the confusion on.
**Bclymer**: That's the thing.
**Bclymer**: Like, people get busy and they just.
**Bclymer**: They see.
**Bclymer**: I think what he did is he looked at the drawing, that one with all the colors on it that we were just looking at a minute ago, and he sees air compressor, or a different term, pneumatics, in a different spot.
**Bclymer**: He's like, oh, I guess they're adding more air compressors over here.
**Mparsons**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And, you know, instead of looking at it, and he sees outlets.
**Bclymer**: No, there's outlets over here now instead of now.
**Bclymer**: We already had that many, so just had to go back and forth with them, show them what actually changed and cleared all that up.
**Aelkarrimy**: That's very clear now.
**Aelkarrimy**: Perfect.
**Kevin.ly**: Well, I appreciate it, y' all.
**Kevin.ly**: Thank you.
**Bclymer**: All right, thanks.
**Aelkarrimy**: Thank you.
**Aelkarrimy**: Thanks, everyone.
**Bclymer**: All right, we'll see you next week.
**Aelkarrimy**: Take care.
**Aelkarrimy**: Goodbye.
**Aelkarrimy**: You suka.
**Jdawson**: Did you want me to hang back or anything?
**Aelkarrimy**: Or are you good?
**Bryan.wagar**: I just.
**Bryan.wagar**: I want you to stay here.
**Jdawson**: I gotcha.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Kevin.ly**: Maybe we should start a different co.
**Kevin.ly**: Opus with the firefighter.
