## Transcript
**Ataylor**: Hey, Tim.
**Blake.schneider**: Good morning.
**Ataylor**: How are you.
**Brianj**: Doing?
**Blake.schneider**: Just fine.
**Jdawson**: Tim.
**Jdawson**: I still don't have an answer on FedEx electrical, so I was there yesterday.
**Jdawson**: It looks like we got enough done.
**Jdawson**: Convenience, receptacles, etc.
**Jdawson**: So when we get that drywall done, you'll be able to set those panels.
**Brianj**: Yep.
**Blake.schneider**: We'll be back.
**Jdawson**: Do you know how we're tracking on like the even demon, the sub meter and all that, Making sure we have everything.
**Blake.schneider**: Everything for the gear portion should be ordered.
**Blake.schneider**: Yeah, Joanne told me if not just showed up, everything was delivered, so.
**Blake.schneider**: Okay, I see the guys go through and make sure everything actually arrived that should be there.
**Brianj**: Yeah, let's do.
**Jdawson**: Let's do that.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: When are you guys getting in there to do your overhead?
**Blake.schneider**: What overhead?
**Jdawson**: Well, we have lights and exit signs.
**Blake.schneider**: And not until the grid goes up.
**Jdawson**: Are you gonna be able to get to it with the grid up?
**Blake.schneider**: Yeah, I mean all of our lights, we're just.
**Blake.schneider**: We're just gonna zip tie to the ceiling grid wire for all the lights.
**Blake.schneider**: Jumpers.
**Jdawson**: I know, I just know it's hard to.
**Brianj**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: It's just hard to pull.
**Jdawson**: Pull wire through there sometimes.
**Brianj**: So.
**Blake.schneider**: Yeah, there's so many.
**Blake.schneider**: There's so many lights that's like.
**Blake.schneider**: We're just going to do jumpers to each light and then it'll just be supported on the ceiling grid wire because every.
**Blake.schneider**: All my two by fours have to have ceiling grid wire too.
**Blake.schneider**: So.
**Brianj**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: So Tim, you need to get in there before ceiling grid goes up to get your ceiling or your wire for the lights in.
**Blake.schneider**: No, that'd be a nightmare.
**Jdawson**: Why would that be a nightmare?
**Jdawson**: To be able to work with a lift and not have to worry about grid in your way.
**Blake.schneider**: I'm not, I'm not gonna drop 20ft of wire for each light or 15ft of wire for each light.
**Blake.schneider**: If I'm just going from light to light to light, it's going to be 10 foot per light.
**Jdawson**: I get stringing them together.
**Jdawson**: I'm talking about.
**Jdawson**: So are you.
**Jdawson**: Those lights are just.
**Jdawson**: Can you make sure that they're recorded.
**Ataylor**: Is what I want to know.
**Brianj**: Yeah.
**Blake.schneider**: What do you mean you're going to be supported?
**Jdawson**: A lot of times you'll have a, like either a.
**Jdawson**: A wire to the deck or something around each light.
**Jdawson**: So we just need to make sure when we're running those wires.
**Brianj**: Yeah.
**Blake.schneider**: When your guys go to put their ceiling grid wire up, I will put my ceiling grid wire up.
**Ataylor**: That's what.
**Ataylor**: That's what.
**Jdawson**: That's what we were called that, that's.
**Ataylor**: What I was saying.
**Ataylor**: And you went off.
**Blake.schneider**: Sorry, I thought you were talking about the wires, the power for the lights.
**Jdawson**: No, I don't care about that.
**Blake.schneider**: Yeah, well, yeah, once your guys put the ceiling grid grid wire up, I'll do the same.
**Jdawson**: And as far as we know, for, for like, like the gfx, the.
**Blake.schneider**: The other issue with that is like I've got to be somewhat close to where my light's going and I can kind of go off of their grid wire layout to put my grid wire up to try and get as close to the lights as possible.
**Jdawson**: Or you can just do it, you know, shoot a laser.
**Jdawson**: Do you have one of those point lasers?
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: You lay it out on the ground.
**Blake.schneider**: Yeah, that's what we'll do.
**Blake.schneider**: But knowing where their grid wire is going gives me somewhat idea of where their grid is going.
**Jdawson**: Okay, Alex.
**Jdawson**: And, and I noticed something.
**Jdawson**: I know we're probably waiting, but we know we have that front vestibule to.
**Jdawson**: To.
**Brianj**: Yeah.
**Brianj**: Frame.
**Brianj**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: So I'm just making sure that's on your radar.
**Jdawson**: I know we got a lot of people coming in and out, so.
**Jdawson**: I can't hear you.
**Ataylor**: I haven't forgotten it, if that's what you're asking.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, well, I was just.
**Jdawson**: I forgot about it.
**Jdawson**: I was looking at the drawings, so.
**Jdawson**: And we have electrical in that wall for the heat for.
**Jdawson**: There's something.
**Jdawson**: I know we have electrical around there.
**Brianj**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: Well, Tim, thanks for being on.
**Jdawson**: Do you have anything for us you need?
**Blake.schneider**: No, just Alex.
**Blake.schneider**: Just get with them on, I guess.
**Blake.schneider**: Waiting to get the panels up to pull.
**Blake.schneider**: Do that shutdown.
**Blake.schneider**: So how long is it going to take to finish that.
**Blake.schneider**: Those walls to put my panels up.
**Ataylor**: And we're going to start hanging this afternoon.
**Brianj**: Okay.
**Brianj**: I just.
**Blake.schneider**: I just don't want to like catch them off guard with the shutdown.
**Jdawson**: I would say middle to middle to end of next week, Tim.
**Brianj**: Okay.
**Blake.schneider**: My plan is to get the panels and all the wire pulled to one of our junction boxes set in the back store room and we'll just leave it coiled up and then from there we'll just schedule that shut overnight shutdown to finish the pipe work into the gear and then pull the rest of the wire up into the gear and land it.
**Jdawson**: So we're piped into the space though, right?
**Jdawson**: All that's done?
**Brianj**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: So all we have to do is pull wire, right?
**Blake.schneider**: No, we.
**Blake.schneider**: So we need to make our pipe connection to our gear and the pipe connection to Neiman's gear.
**Brianj**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Which we can't do until those Panels are up.
**Blake.schneider**: Exactly.
**Brianj**: All right.
**Jdawson**: Well, it's moving quick.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Blake.schneider**: We'Re ready.
**Brianj**: We ready?
**Brianj**: All right.
**Jdawson**: That's all I got.
**Brianj**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Alex, we need to make sure someone from McCurdy's showing up.
**Jdawson**: I know HBC is almost done, so I'm not.
**Jdawson**: But just the people that need to be here.
**Jdawson**: Be like, hey, guys, speed now or forever hold your peace.
