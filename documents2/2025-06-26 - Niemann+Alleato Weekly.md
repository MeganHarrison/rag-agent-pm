## Transcript
**Sclevenger**: Still shooting for that September 1st date.
**Cmortensen**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: That was my next question.
**Bclymer**: Great.
**Bclymer**: Great.
**Sclevenger**: So last, last week, I set the tone with FedEx and let them know, hey, this may be pushed back a little, but we can only control what we can control with the city.
**Sclevenger**: And they also took, they also took two weeks to get me their revised sign package.
**Bclymer**: Right, right.
**Sclevenger**: So we have that in our back pocket if they give you any pushback.
**Bclymer**: Okay, okay.
**Sclevenger**: But.
**Sclevenger**: Okay, it's encouraging.
**Sclevenger**: This round of review is done.
**Sclevenger**: I'm gonna send these comments out today after this conversation and then I should hopefully have.
**Sclevenger**: Have more of an update.
**Sclevenger**: You know, Monday, Tuesday, I.
**Sclevenger**: I'm.
**Sclevenger**: I'm having my baby tomorrow.
**Sclevenger**: We have a scheduled induction, so.
**Sclevenger**: So I will be.
**Sclevenger**: I will be out of pocket tomorrow.
**Bclymer**: Congratulations.
**Sclevenger**: Thank you.
**Sclevenger**: I will be working next week, but I'll have an out of office email.
**Sclevenger**: But obviously, you know, if I'm not answering, reach out to Alex.
**Sclevenger**: But I, I'll still be answering emails, but I'll be at home and I won't be able to be on site.
**Sclevenger**: So.
**Ahuettl**: Aj the.
**Ahuettl**: The proper term is my wife is having our baby.
**Sclevenger**: Yes.
**Sclevenger**: Yes, yes, you're right.
**Sclevenger**: You're right.
**Sclevenger**: Thank you.
**Bclymer**: I didn't catch it, so I'm probably the only one that would have objected, but.
**Bclymer**: Nope, you're good.
**Sclevenger**: I will.
**Sclevenger**: I will be in.
**Sclevenger**: I will be in support of her having the baby.
**Sclevenger**: How's that?
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Ahuettl**: That's better.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Jesse, one lined?
**Cmortensen**: Yeah.
**Sclevenger**: Okay, well, I'll get these responses out, Sean.
**Sclevenger**: And, and hopefully, hopefully they have this second round of review quick.
**Sclevenger**: And if we can start here in July.
**Sclevenger**: We've gotten.
**Sclevenger**: Gotten going already on electrical and we're getting steel delivered.
**Sclevenger**: So we're prepped and ready to get these openings cut and then we'll be knocking it out.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so is that.
**Bclymer**: Are you done on your end?
**Bclymer**: If not, I'll have to have a discussion with you too then regarding another matter.
**Bclymer**: I didn't want to make you short.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: I thought you were good.
**Bclymer**: Glyndon will very likely have more to add on this than I do.
**Bclymer**: But as I'd mentioned, Corey wasn't.
**Bclymer**: Isn't in our meeting today.
**Bclymer**: Corey by choice left the company yesterday, so I don't know who's taking over this project.
**Bclymer**: Glendon, you just got done talking to Rich.
**Bclymer**: Did he make any comments about who was taking over this project?
**Jdawson**: Not exactly sure, but I think I'm going to be involved in it.
**Jdawson**: I'm not sure I'm going to be the for sure lead, but should know before long, but I think I'll definitely have some involvement in it, trying to help pick up some of the slack.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So there you go.
**Cmortensen**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: You know What?
**Bclymer**: I know A.J.
**Sclevenger**: Yeah.
**Sclevenger**: Well, hey, you guys hired us to do a job and make this easy for you, so that's.
**Sclevenger**: That's what we're going to do.
**Sclevenger**: So hopefully, you can be as hands off as possible once we get through this permitting phase.
**Sclevenger**: You know, we'll.
**Sclevenger**: We'll still be the lead in dealing with FedEx and all that, so that way, I know it's stressful anytime someone leaves and you got to pick up the slack.
**Sclevenger**: So that's why you hired us, and that's what we'll do for you.
**Cmortensen**: Okay?
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: All right, A.J.
**Bclymer**: we're good.
**Bclymer**: I'm good.
**Ahuettl**: You?
**Sclevenger**: Good.
**Jdawson**: Glendon, congratulations and best of luck, all right?
**Bclymer**: Yes, certainly.
**Sclevenger**: I'll talk to you again soon.
**Cmortensen**: Okay?
**Bclymer**: All right, thanks, A.J.
**Cmortensen**: All right, bye.
