## Transcript
**Kate.polack**: Foreign.
**Bryan.sheward**: Hey, Kate.
**Kate.polack**: Hey.
**Bryan.sheward**: Hey.
**Bryan.sheward**: Yeah, I'm not sure if Jesse's going to get on or not.
**Bryan.sheward**: Have you had a chance to look at these comments?
**Jdawson**: Yes, Brian and I went through them a little bit earlier today.
**Bryan.sheward**: Yeah.
**Bryan.sheward**: Well, what are your.
**Bryan.sheward**: Your thoughts on them?
**Jdawson**: Well, I guess one question.
**Jdawson**: When it comes to that Title 13 requirements, did we ever give you the drainage memo to submit?
**Jdawson**: Because we did create one and I thought we had sent it to you.
**Jdawson**: So like half of that big purple section should not even.
**Jdawson**: Like they should have everything they need for it.
**Jdawson**: But.
**Jdawson**: Okay, I know we.
**Kate.polack**: Hey, this is Jesse.
**Kate.polack**: I just joined.
**Kate.polack**: Before we move on, can we just.
**Kate.polack**: Let's track that down and then we can start putting this together.
**Kate.polack**: So you said you sent that previously.
**Jdawson**: Would have been a.
**Jdawson**: I just.
**Jdawson**: I didn't actually check in a correspondence, but I know we had done it, so I figured we had sent it to you guys to submit.
**Jdawson**: Maybe they just didn't see it with the resubmittal because we didn't have to resubmit anything for it and they're only seeing documents that got resubmitted on their side.
**Jdawson**: I'm not sure.
**Jdawson**: Let me go at least on my side and see if I can see if we sent it over and if not I can send it again.
**Jdawson**: But I know we did not create an O and M Emmanuel, so we will, I think, have to get that over to you, which should not take that much time for us.
**Bryan.sheward**: So the only thing you need to do it or.
**Bryan.sheward**: Well, I guess we need to work with the owner to get this information.
**Bryan.sheward**: And there were these sitemap comments.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we'll.
**Jdawson**: We'll get the.
**Jdawson**: The site map done.
**Jdawson**: Then there shouldn't be that much.
**Kate.polack**: Ridiculous that they.
**Kate.polack**: How would they know if a site isn't open yet, who's going to be the maintenance staff?
**Bryan.sheward**: Yeah.
**Bryan.sheward**: So.
**Bryan.sheward**: So all these comments here, you're good on Kate.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: 1.
**Jdawson**: Assuming they just don't have our drainage memo, us submitting what we had made before, considering we're not adding any storm structures or anything, like, it should be pretty, pretty much a breeze to get through.
**Jdawson**: Like, same thing with the O and M.
**Jdawson**: We can show the stuff, but since we're not proposing anything being added, it should just be a like check in the box kind of thing.
**Kate.polack**: And then when it's the actual owner of this is the property owner, it's not goodwill.
**Kate.polack**: So would they not be.
**Kate.polack**: They would be referring to the real estate company or whoever manages the property for the actual property owner.
**Kate.polack**: Correct.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Kate.polack**: So, Nick, it's this isn't goodwill.
**Kate.polack**: We need to get.
**Kate.polack**: So we'll send it to Andrew and then he can get with the owner and their people because they do have people that go check the backflow preventer and do all that.
**Kate.polack**: So.
**Bryan.sheward**: Okay.
**Bryan.sheward**: So the site map will be pretty easy, Kate.
**Jdawson**: It should be.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I will also note Brian and I did try to call.
**Jdawson**: One of the other comments is from Brian Blake or whatever.
**Jdawson**: He's who we tried to call first.
**Jdawson**: But since it's Good Friday we figured no one's actually at the city today or anything.
**Jdawson**: So if some of these might turn into.
**Jdawson**: We're going to have to reach out to them next week kind of comment.
**Jdawson**: So just giving you that forewarning now.
**Bryan.sheward**: And then there, there was this added water easement.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So we think that looks like it's on the other corner of the Aldi.
**Jdawson**: Aldi.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So if we have to do anything for it that's gonna cause survey to have to go back out and get information and then we could.
**Jdawson**: I mean we can do it.
**Jdawson**: It's just gonna take some more time than by Wednesday when you wanna resubmit the stuff.
**Kate.polack**: If the.
**Kate.polack**: Again, if this is the.
**Kate.polack**: You know, this is again the owner.
**Kate.polack**: And when we had that meeting with them, Brian was on.
**Kate.polack**: He said they can address all this with a letter.
**Kate.polack**: So if there's an existing easement recorded with the city, why can.
**Kate.polack**: Why would we have to.
**Kate.polack**: To resurvey versus just writing that letter and then they could.
**Kate.polack**: They could.
**Jdawson**: Were you saying Brian Shorter?
**Jdawson**: Brian Blake?
**Kate.polack**: Yeah, Brian Sherwood.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Kate.polack**: Yeah, he was on the call.
**Kate.polack**: We organized the owner goodwill did with the property owner and their attorney and like all their people.
**Kate.polack**: And Brian said that they can address that easement with a letter instead of redoing anything.
**Jdawson**: I think that was just about that sanitary one.
**Jdawson**: The water one's the first time we've heard this.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Kate.polack**: Oh, so this is the first time we heard.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Kate.polack**: Here to begin with.
**Kate.polack**: But that is.
**Kate.polack**: Is that even.
**Kate.polack**: That doesn't even service us, I don't think.
**Kate.polack**: Isn't.
**Kate.polack**: Isn't our sanitary coming out the backside.
**Kate.polack**: You go up on the sheet, Nick.
**Kate.polack**: Yeah.
**Kate.polack**: There's our.
**Kate.polack**: See.
**Jdawson**: Talking about the water comment or the sanitary comment.
**Kate.polack**: The sanitary.
**Jdawson**: Oh, yes.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So in previous conversation we had with Brian Blake at CBU, the non exclusive any egress easement or whatever.
**Jdawson**: That 36 foot one down below.
**Jdawson**: That's what they're talking about.
**Jdawson**: The legal document or just the letter should serve as a.
**Jdawson**: Just giving them access to that or giving them what was the exact wording.
**Jdawson**: I'm trying to think naming CBU as a grantee to that existing easement should solve the problem with the sanitary.
**Jdawson**: The water question with the Google Maps screenshot and all that.
**Jdawson**: That's the first we're hearing about that one.
**Jdawson**: That comment or that easement.
**Jdawson**: So that's one where if we do need to do anything about it, that will cause us to need to go out and get more survey, if that makes sense.
**Kate.polack**: Well, what makes sense to me is this city is like.
**Kate.polack**: I don't get why this is us like Goodwill.
**Kate.polack**: It doesn't own this stuff.
**Kate.polack**: We're not.
**Kate.polack**: We're not permitting to do anything with that.
**Kate.polack**: Unbelievable.
**Kate.polack**: Like, that's even.
**Kate.polack**: That's across the street.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And that's why we tried calling Brian earlier and Brian Blake was cbu.
**Jdawson**: And since he didn't, you know, wasn't there, didn't answer the call.
**Jdawson**: This is.
**Jdawson**: These are a couple of comments that we just need to like, get the information from him since we don't have this formatted.
**Jdawson**: Provided by him yet or assuming we don't.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Because it wasn't in any of the attachments that you sent over.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Kate.polack**: Yeah.
**Kate.polack**: This serves like the adjacent property, doesn't it?
**Kate.polack**: This water line in particular, or sanitary sewer.
**Jdawson**: Not sure.
**Jdawson**: With the one that's in that snip of the Google Earth or whatever.
**Jdawson**: Because it.
**Jdawson**: My understanding is it's the water vault.
**Jdawson**: We had to show that we're updating.
**Jdawson**: Certain.
**Kate.polack**: Yeah, but that water could be wrong north of that red box.
**Kate.polack**: It's kind of confusing.
**Kate.polack**: What the.
**Kate.polack**: But the.
**Kate.polack**: Yeah, if you.
**Kate.polack**: You know, in the.
**Kate.polack**: The vault.
**Kate.polack**: If you zoom in a little bit, Nick, it's on the bigger portion.
**Kate.polack**: The vault we're modifying.
**Kate.polack**: Nick.
**Kate.polack**: Like right there.
**Kate.polack**: Like, that's the.
**Kate.polack**: That's the water vault we're modifying.
**Kate.polack**: Like this sanitary sewer that are referencing now.
**Kate.polack**: That's why I don't understand.
**Kate.polack**: Our sewer line runs parallel to the.
**Kate.polack**: To the north side of the building.
**Kate.polack**: And if you can go up Nick.
**Kate.polack**: A little bit like electrical fiber.
**Kate.polack**: SD is that sanitary drain?
**Kate.polack**: That's storm drain.
**Kate.polack**: So is there any sanitary coming in this building?
**Kate.polack**: From the backside.
**Bryan.sheward**: It says this is storm.
**Kate.polack**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: It could just be going up from the north and shooting out towards the west instead of the east, too.
**Kate.polack**: Is this something you've run into before with them in Kate.
**Kate.polack**: In Bloomington, where you're not touching something?
**Jdawson**: This is my.
**Jdawson**: Personally.
**Jdawson**: My first time working with Bloomington, so I know Brian's worked with them a couple of times before, and I know they've had a couple things.
**Jdawson**: Issues with getting, you know, comments and extra things given to us in the past, but I'm not sure to what extreme it's been.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Bryan.sheward**: So.
**Bryan.sheward**: So what do you think, Jesse?
**Bryan.sheward**: You do a letter for this as well?
**Kate.polack**: Well, we need to get.
**Kate.polack**: Get Andrew to set up another meeting with.
**Kate.polack**: Well, after, you know, Will brought your.
**Kate.polack**: Brian be back, Kate.
**Kate.polack**: Monday.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, he.
**Jdawson**: He's just been very busy today, so getting a quick meeting and wasn't going to be able to happen for him today.
**Jdawson**: But I know we'll try to call Brian Blake again probably on Monday.
**Kate.polack**: Okay.
**Kate.polack**: If you can get a hold of that guy and then see what the heck he's really looking for here.
**Kate.polack**: And then we'll get another meeting with the owner and, like, because this is all stuff they need to provide.
**Kate.polack**: And you know, in that call, they're even gonna pay us to do the water vault upgrades to that backflow vault because it has nothing to do with Goodwill.
**Kate.polack**: Well, it kind of does, but it's.
**Kate.polack**: They're only half like all these also on that same service.
**Kate.polack**: So it's not like, exclusive to the Goodwill space.
**Bryan.sheward**: So set up a meeting for Monday afternoon.
**Bryan.sheward**: Do you.
**Bryan.sheward**: You think you can talk to him Monday morning, Kate?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, assuming, you know, he's back in.
**Jdawson**: Not busy in the morning.
**Jdawson**: I could.
**Jdawson**: We could for sure call him in the morning.
**Bryan.sheward**: Yeah, just let us know after you call him and we can set up the meeting with the owner.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Kate.polack**: Was that the only comments that they came back with?
**Kate.polack**: So they accepted our water vault?
**Bryan.sheward**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Kate.polack**: Procedure.
**Kate.polack**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So, yeah, that comment right there in purple is the same thing with that.
**Jdawson**: What's on the front page.
**Jdawson**: Just needing to make sure we send them that information if they didn't already get it.
**Kate.polack**: Where is that form?
**Kate.polack**: They.
**Kate.polack**: They attached the form, Nick, that was all filled out.
**Kate.polack**: I don't get it.
**Kate.polack**: It said one.
**Kate.polack**: One of the other attachments in that email.
**Bryan.sheward**: I'm not sure.
**Kate.polack**: Can you find the email?
**Jdawson**: And then it looks like the only other comment was about updating a legend on this erosion control plan, which is just getting rid of items that we aren't using.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: Shouldn't be.
**Jdawson**: Shouldn't be too bad.
**Kate.polack**: Yeah.
**Kate.polack**: The CBU form was one of them plans.
**Kate.polack**: Yeah.
**Kate.polack**: That third document, Nick, if you open it up.
**Bryan.sheward**: Can you share your screen, Jesse?
**Kate.polack**: Let's see.
**Kate.polack**: Like this here.
**Bryan.sheward**: Yeah, that.
**Bryan.sheward**: That we turned in, Right?
**Kate.polack**: This says Total Disturb Rate 0.1.
**Bryan.sheward**: Yeah.
**Kate.polack**: And they said they're not right.
**Kate.polack**: So they saying the 0.1 or less or more requires it and that's why we've got a.
**Kate.polack**: Yeah, so we were right there at the bottom end.
**Bryan.sheward**: I think it was like 4,000 something square feet is 0.1 acres when I looked it up.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, it's a little over 4,000.
**Kate.polack**: This is the worst for sharing a screen.
**Kate.polack**: That's here.
**Kate.polack**: But Kate, did you guys.
**Kate.polack**: Were you able to see this part of the email?
**Kate.polack**: Is that what Nick forwarded to you?
**Kate.polack**: It had all these things in it.
**Jdawson**: I just got a.
**Jdawson**: It looks like I have all of those things.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, you do.
**Kate.polack**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I didn't get a forwarded email, but I got all the attachments sent, so.
**Kate.polack**: Okay, so this is their comment greater than.
**Kate.polack**: Okay, so this wasn't a comment that was from before.
**Kate.polack**: This is one they just came up with now?
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Bryan.sheward**: Yeah.
**Bryan.sheward**: As far as comments here, because they had requested the disturbed area.
**Bryan.sheward**: And then once they saw it was over the 2,000 something square feet, then.
**Bryan.sheward**: Then they added a comment.
**Kate.polack**: I just saw a message so for Maria from a few minutes ago.
**Kate.polack**: Okay.
**Kate.polack**: Yeah, but like with that whole list of things, it's really three things.
**Kate.polack**: An ONM manual, a drainage spec.
**Bryan.sheward**: Yeah, I had to do a drainage.
**Bryan.sheward**: And then the ONM manual.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that's the big thing they put on the first page the per title 13 requirements.
**Kate.polack**: You did like a test?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Kate.polack**: Come in.
**Kate.polack**: Let me.
**Kate.polack**: I'm gonna upload something into the foundations folder right now, just at the bottom of the list.
**Kate.polack**: So this easement thing that's on here now, they didn't even.
**Kate.polack**: They referenced.
**Kate.polack**: They still haven't received the sewer one from us or the water one from us.
**Bryan.sheward**: We.
**Bryan.sheward**: We haven't given them any information for the.
**Bryan.sheward**: What was it?
**Bryan.sheward**: A storm easement?
**Kate.polack**: Okay.
**Bryan.sheward**: Yeah, we haven't turned anything in for that.
**Bryan.sheward**: The sanitary easement then.
**Bryan.sheward**: Yeah.
**Bryan.sheward**: Do you think it.
**Bryan.sheward**: When do you think you can have everything ready, Kate?
**Jdawson**: Probably since it's just sending you guys over our drainage memo again in case it got lost doing the om.
**Jdawson**: And then I think it was just one plan sheet update.
**Jdawson**: I can assume we can get it done on Monday, Tuesday, next week.
**Bryan.sheward**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And then we'll be sure to see if on our end we can figure out the whole thing with Brian Blake on the easements and see if we can get a hold of him.
**Bryan.sheward**: That should work.
**Kate.polack**: Are you able to shake sense into people over the phone?
**Kate.polack**: We do that.
**Jdawson**: I don't know.
**Kate.polack**: We'll call it good Monday shake up session.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Kate.polack**: Okay.
**Kate.polack**: Well, I appreciate you getting on the call, Kate.
**Kate.polack**: Nick, thanks for setting it up.
**Kate.polack**: And it's just like this is killing us schedule wise because their move out date's not moving.
**Kate.polack**: But my getting started is so like this.
**Kate.polack**: We have to get it like this thing correct and back to them this next week.
**Kate.polack**: And I don't know, it's hard when they keep coming up with something new every time.
**Kate.polack**: It's like I'm in Miami trying to get a permanent.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I'll make sure to get this guy's g.
**Jdawson**: As soon as I.
**Jdawson**: As soon as we get it done early next week.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Kate.polack**: Okay.
**Kate.polack**: And as maybe if it's easier in a call, but if you could write, if you want to write on it, say this information here addresses this comment here in full.
**Kate.polack**: And this information here addresses this other comment in full.
**Kate.polack**: Just so we know, we understand that everything's answered.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Kate.polack**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: I'll probably just mark up this PDF and send it back.
**Kate.polack**: All right.
**Kate.polack**: All right, well, thanks.
**Kate.polack**: Have a good weekend.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, you guys, too.
**Bryan.sheward**: Thanks, guys.
