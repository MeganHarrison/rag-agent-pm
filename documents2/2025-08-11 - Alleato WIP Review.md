## Transcript
**Jdawson**: Hey, Jesse, we doing?
**Speaker 1**: I'm good.
**Speaker 1**: How are you?
**Jdawson**: Excellent.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, Alleato a couple minutes late.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, that's fine.
**Speaker 1**: That's fine.
**Speaker 1**: Give me a second.
**Speaker 1**: Let me grab something real quick.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Okay, Sam.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, I'm back.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Speaker 1**: So let me share my screen.
**Speaker 1**: Remember the WIP we had reviewed?
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Speaker 1**: I'm waiting for it to load.
**Jdawson**: I'll tell you as soon as I see it on the screen.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: I'm gonna see which screen.
**Speaker 1**: I think it's one.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: You can see it, right?
**Jdawson**: Oh, yes.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: So we're just getting ready to review the.
**Speaker 1**: To prepare the June financials.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: So I just wanted to make sure that everything was okay and everything looked good.
**Speaker 1**: 6, 8, 30.
**Speaker 1**: Some of the highlighted ones are the ones where I'm missing stuff, but I can go ahead and fill those in later.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Speaker 1**: I change orders unallocated cost source.
**Jdawson**: So applied engineering or are you just going to go through all of them?
**Speaker 1**: Yes, yes, we're going to go through all of them.
**Speaker 1**: So I was just in the middle of filling in.
**Speaker 1**: 55, 53, 2.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, we're just gonna go through all of them.
**Speaker 1**: But I wanted to start with.
**Speaker 1**: With those and I'm gonna.
**Speaker 1**: So Alta Dallas, that one looks okay so far.
**Speaker 1**: I can go in and update the budget and the contract amount.
**Speaker 1**: One of the ones that stood out to me was aspire.
**Speaker 1**: The budget based on what I have.
**Speaker 1**: Aspire is still in Procore, right?
**Jdawson**: No, it's.
**Jdawson**: It's in job planner.
**Speaker 1**: It's in job planner.
**Jdawson**: So you're saying the budget.
**Speaker 1**: 24, 108.
**Speaker 1**: Let me pull it up.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: We had one change order.
**Jdawson**: So the current budget is 174.
**Jdawson**: 7750.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: So current budget is 174.
**Speaker 1**: 7750.
**Speaker 1**: But the build to date is.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: The bill to date is.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, did I highlight the wrong one?
**Speaker 1**: Oh, it's the cost.
**Speaker 1**: So the budget is 167.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Jdawson**: The budget's 174.78.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, yes.
**Speaker 1**: Yes.
**Speaker 1**: 1-7-478.
**Speaker 1**: So we show in a build to date of.
**Speaker 1**: Let me hide this to make it.
**Speaker 1**: Something is off here because one.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: So I think what I need to do is I need to update these numbers.
**Jdawson**: Which ones?
**Jdawson**: The.
**Jdawson**: The cos. Yeah, that's wrong.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I think that's what I need to update.
**Speaker 1**: So 24, 108.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: So budget 67, 45, 10.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: So these two do equal, though.
**Speaker 1**: 4,000, 509.
**Speaker 1**: Contract.
**Speaker 1**: There was a contract change.
**Jdawson**: 2008.
**Jdawson**: 7,008 50.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: And what about then what are the approved changes?
**Speaker 1**: Because that was 4509.
**Speaker 1**: 67.
**Jdawson**: Oh, where did that come from?
**Speaker 1**: It's if I look in job planner under approved changes.
**Jdawson**: Well, there's, there's owner changes.
**Jdawson**: So you go to contracts and then you open up the contract and then you go to change orders and it gives a summary of all the owner change orders.
**Speaker 1**: Talking about the budget side, like the cost budget.
**Speaker 1**: If I go to aspire and then I go to budget.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, here, let me move this screen over here.
**Speaker 1**: So on a budget, there's approved changes.
**Jdawson**: Well, I think those may have been internal changes.
**Jdawson**: We wrote the contract change orders.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: So it needs to be the contract change orders.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, so once.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, so I change that and then I think I also need to adjust the these contract revenue.
**Speaker 1**: It is 3193 3.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, that puts us in a positive.
**Jdawson**: Because this is saying cost to date on the job is130.
**Jdawson**: 09496.
**Jdawson**: But you've shown138,545.
**Jdawson**: Why is that.
**Speaker 1**: So cost to date.
**Speaker 1**: This is not the cost today.
**Speaker 1**: This is just a budget.
**Speaker 1**: The cost to date is here.
**Speaker 1**: Cost to date is here.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: 130.
**Speaker 1**: 095.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: And this is the revenue to date.
**Speaker 1**: So another one that looked off was Siva 2424-1111.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, let's look at that one.
**Speaker 1**: Siva Burn Bill.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: Which is the first one that you.
**Speaker 1**: Looks off this one.
**Speaker 1**: So let's look for the contract.
**Jdawson**: So it's the contract amount.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I just want to double check the cost.
**Speaker 1**: Definitely the budget looks off, but the contract amount.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so that started out.
**Speaker 1**: That's.
**Speaker 1**: That's weird.
**Jdawson**: $1,061,829.59 in change order approved owner change orders.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, so how do I get to that in.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, I'm going to change order.
**Speaker 1**: So it started out as 32,600 and then change orders.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: 1,006,1829.
**Speaker 1**: 59.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: That's the contract amount.
**Speaker 1**: And now we're looking at the budget.
**Speaker 1**: The cost budget started out at 57,001 million 0698, 29.
**Speaker 1**: Think it's the contract revenue.
**Jdawson**: So the revised budget is 1 million 119 4, 68.
**Speaker 1**: Yes.
**Speaker 1**: 1 million 119.
**Speaker 1**: 468.
**Speaker 1**: But I need to deduct line item 55.
**Jdawson**: Which line item are you taking out?
**Speaker 1**: 55.
**Speaker 1**: The contractor fee.
**Speaker 1**: Because that one, that's the one that has the insurance and the allocated cost.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Speaker 1**: So technically, that's supposed to be the profit on the job.
**Speaker 1**: Is that correct?
**Jdawson**: Alleato, like insurance.
**Jdawson**: And I don't know how he's moving that, but the.
**Jdawson**: You know, because now you got to try and figure out if insurance is.
**Jdawson**: You'd have to try and figure out how much of a percentage of our yearly insurance cost is to cover this one.
**Jdawson**: I don't know how they figure that out.
**Jdawson**: So I left.
**Jdawson**: The only thing I consider profit is the unallocated cost and the fee.
**Speaker 1**: Contractor fee.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: All right, I can do that.
**Speaker 1**: So unallocated cost and contractor fee and contract to fee.
**Jdawson**: It's 119007.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: So would you agree that the job is 95% or almost 100% complete?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, they had one small minor change.
**Jdawson**: There was like $30,000 worth of work, so.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: All right.
**Jdawson**: But he's.
**Jdawson**: I think he's billed it already.
**Jdawson**: 100%.
**Speaker 1**: Yes, it's 100%.
**Speaker 1**: Alleato.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So Alleato Atlanta, 25101.
**Speaker 1**: I'm guessing we have the same issue with that one.
**Jdawson**: So the contract amount.
**Jdawson**: Is that a question?
**Speaker 1**: Yes.
**Speaker 1**: So it's safe to go with the contract amounts in job planner?
**Speaker 1**: Pretty much, yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, so Callmark Atlanta, 2785654.
**Speaker 1**: No change orders.
**Speaker 1**: And then the budget.
**Speaker 1**: 705654.
**Speaker 1**: Change orders of $12,000.
**Speaker 1**: 12, 80, 35.
**Jdawson**: Wait, no, that's just approved changes.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, approved changes.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: It has to be a.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, has to be approved.
**Jdawson**: Change the contract amount.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So then the problem with this one then is.
**Speaker 1**: Here, let me go to contractor fee.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: 25,060.
**Speaker 1**: Yes.
**Speaker 1**: And unallocated cost.
**Speaker 1**: 42 06869.
**Speaker 1**: So 208 is the total estimate.
**Speaker 1**: But if we look at the cost to date is 225.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Speaker 1**: So it shows that we're a little overspent on that one.
**Speaker 1**: So do we need to adjust the contractor fee under unallocated cost?
**Jdawson**: Well, yeah, because, like, one thing Brandon does go through and charge certain things to certain jobs after it's done.
**Jdawson**: So there is the -20,000.
**Jdawson**: 2:41 since the last time this was balanced out.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: So, yeah, you have to adjust it.
**Jdawson**: Now.
**Jdawson**: I can take out.
**Jdawson**: I can do a budget modification, but I would have to go fix all this stuff.
**Jdawson**: And I just got tired of fixing these jobs every month.
**Speaker 1**: Every month.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, when costs would just keep coming in.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, you need to.
**Jdawson**: So you want me to add that up for you?
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, sure, if you just want to let me know.
**Speaker 1**: But It.
**Speaker 1**: It may be best maybe after this.
**Speaker 1**: This meeting.
**Speaker 1**: Maybe board.
**Speaker 1**: Every time we have this meeting, you can go ahead and update it on your end because this will kind of help us look at.
**Speaker 1**: Look at everything.
**Jdawson**: You mean update job or.
**Speaker 1**: Yes, job planner.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Well, that's what I was saying.
**Jdawson**: I. I didn't really want to do that other than okay.
**Jdawson**: Of course.
**Jdawson**: I know if that's not done, then this system.
**Jdawson**: So you'd have to just take that overage, deduct it from.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I can deduct it from here.
**Speaker 1**: How much was it?
**Jdawson**: This will take $20,002.41.
**Jdawson**: Off of.
**Speaker 1**: $20,041.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: So here I'm going to add a comment here.
**Speaker 1**: So we know deducted.
**Speaker 1**: What.
**Speaker 1**: What do we deduct?
**Jdawson**: I would say additional charges to job after complet.
**Speaker 1**: So eventually we.
**Speaker 1**: We will update the final project numbers in job plan, correct?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, well, we just.
**Jdawson**: What we need to do is like, just have a discussion with Brandon and say, like, are we ready to close this job out 100%?
**Jdawson**: Are you still going to charge things to it?
**Jdawson**: Because all it is is all these expenses that come through when he codes things.
**Jdawson**: Then it's.
**Jdawson**: It's hitting jobs like this burn video.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: At some point, you don't want to keep updating this each month, so maybe we pick a new job to code that stuff too and close these out.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So this one is now.
**Speaker 1**: It looks okay now.
**Speaker 1**: So.
**Jdawson**: So the total estimate, though, should it equal cost, cost of revenues?
**Jdawson**: Should those two be the same?
**Jdawson**: It's off a little bit.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: If it.
**Speaker 1**: If the job is completely charged out.
**Speaker 1**: Yes.
**Speaker 1**: But I did have a. I did have a meeting with Fritzi this morning.
**Speaker 1**: I was pretty frustrated that the reimbursements have not been.
**Speaker 1**: Been posted like the, you know, the cell phone reimbursements and stuff.
**Speaker 1**: So I don't know why the payroll is posted, but for some reason the reimbursements was not.
**Speaker 1**: We're not.
**Speaker 1**: Not posted.
**Speaker 1**: So if we post the reimbursements to date from January, I think that amount may.
**Speaker 1**: May disappear.
**Jdawson**: Telling me none of the jobs are getting hit with either truck allowances or cell phone costs.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, she didn't post it.
**Speaker 1**: She had them started in January.
**Speaker 1**: We had everything broken out.
**Speaker 1**: And, you know, Jose is posting the.
**Speaker 1**: The payroll, and I thought everything was being posted because it is the payroll.
**Speaker 1**: So we have a.
**Speaker 1**: Had a weekly meeting we have every Mondays, and she's asking, you know, usually I have this meeting to kind of see what they need, what they have an issues with what do we need to address.
**Speaker 1**: And I see these transactions and they say January.
**Speaker 1**: Like why, why are we still looking at January?
**Speaker 1**: Oh, I haven't posted the reallocation.
**Speaker 1**: Why not?
**Speaker 1**: So I gave her to end of the day today to post everything.
**Jdawson**: So seven months of all of that's going to hit the jobs now.
**Speaker 1**: Pretty much, unfortunately.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: But moving forward, Jose will take that on.
**Speaker 1**: He's doing the payroll.
**Speaker 1**: It makes no, no sense to break it up.
**Speaker 1**: So.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Speaker 1**: If you post the, the labor or, you know, I, I don't understand what the logic was behind, behind that.
**Speaker 1**: But that was, I guess my fault for assuming that payroll is all being posted.
**Speaker 1**: But we'll make sure it gets done by the end of the day today, right?
**Jdawson**: Well, yeah, I see the charges and I guess you see the little miscellaneous things because it's all like tax info, I guess, is the only things that were coming out before.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Was it tax and health insurance and all those things?
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I'm just thinking if I was a pm, I'd be like, what the what?
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, if, if, if they come asking, we'll just have to, you know, some.
**Speaker 1**: But the only person that I really get questions from is, you know, is Glenn.
**Jdawson**: Of course.
**Jdawson**: But like that's the thing is in, you know, we know those charges are out there.
**Jdawson**: So if they weren't hitting.
**Jdawson**: But then maybe we, what the guys maybe don't know is, you know, that's there's only once a month it's supposed to hit for the truck or the cell.
**Jdawson**: So if you were really watching your stuff, you'd be like, well, how come these are always the same?
**Speaker 1**: You'll be catching it every two weeks.
**Jdawson**: Instead of the added truck and all that.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: But it's just something they'll have to account for.
**Jdawson**: They should.
**Jdawson**: I mean their budget was set up with the truck allowance for everybody.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: It was on the job, so it's not like it was just free extra money for them.
**Jdawson**: They'll just have to account for it.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: And I guess, you know, if, if they were expecting it and seeing it, it'll be like, okay, so this, this line item finally has, you know, some charges on it, but.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Is that actually going to go to the truck allowance or is it going to go to the labor cost code?
**Speaker 1**: If there's a truck allowance, Costco, that's where it should go.
**Speaker 1**: You have a truck allowance, Costco.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I see.
**Speaker 1**: A truck.
**Speaker 1**: Truck allowance.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: 0165502 Yep.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I didn't know if they just kept that in with the labor.
**Jdawson**: If everything's just in the labor for.
**Speaker 1**: This job, for example, comop, there's no truck allowance budget.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Well, they had.
**Jdawson**: Looks like $80 in there and they took it out.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: 79 in there.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Then there's direct cost.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So.
**Speaker 1**: And another one.
**Speaker 1**: Let's see.
**Speaker 1**: These didn't have budgets in, but I guess they should now.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, I'll look at that one.
**Speaker 1**: Forza.
**Speaker 1**: Is this not finished?
**Jdawson**: Forza?
**Jdawson**: Yes, that's done.
**Speaker 1**: Not sure why the budget kept changing, but let me look at that one right now.
**Speaker 1**: Pro4.
**Jdawson**: I think that was simply design SA.
**Speaker 1**: When did that job end?
**Jdawson**: 24 1A.
**Speaker 1**: It looks like this year to date cost.
**Jdawson**: All we did is provided design services on that.
**Jdawson**: We never did any construction, so I'm not sure that we ever created a job for that.
**Speaker 1**: So it was probably billed as part of this one.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, it would have been.
**Jdawson**: Just build to that now.
**Jdawson**: I don't know.
**Jdawson**: Look here and see if.
**Jdawson**: I don't think we created a job.
**Speaker 1**: I don't even see it in Procore.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: If it's not.
**Jdawson**: And we probably.
**Jdawson**: I mean, we wouldn't have created it anywhere when it just became design.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, so then we probably need to move this cost to.
**Speaker 1**: This was just a design.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Not.
**Speaker 1**: It was not a part of the contract.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Our design cost for 38.
**Jdawson**: No design costs.
**Jdawson**: We end up doing three eight, nine eight two.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: It's just 38.
**Jdawson**: 982 for the design.
**Speaker 1**: 38,982.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: 38,982 was the.
**Speaker 1**: And that was completed.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, 38,982.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: And that's.
**Speaker 1**: That's what was billed.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, 30,082.
**Speaker 1**: And the cost of revenue was 30,000.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Speaker 1**: What was the.
**Speaker 1**: The budgeted cost?
**Jdawson**: The original budget was 38,982.
**Speaker 1**: And there was no.
**Jdawson**: No change orders.
**Jdawson**: No.
**Speaker 1**: And no contract.
**Speaker 1**: No.
**Speaker 1**: It was all profit or.
**Jdawson**: Oh, no.
**Jdawson**: The.
**Jdawson**: The design cost.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Let me see.
**Jdawson**: So do we have invoices that have been paid?
**Jdawson**: Is that the total amount of 21,000?
**Speaker 1**: No, the total amount is invoices that have been paid at 30,000.
**Speaker 1**: So I'm thinking to just add the.
**Speaker 1**: Because I don't see it.
**Speaker 1**: So If I add 8,584, that's it, the 30,000.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Well, there's no approved change orders.
**Jdawson**: It was like.
**Jdawson**: When you say original budget, you mean that's the original cost of what we thought it would take?
**Speaker 1**: Yes, that that.
**Speaker 1**: So this is.
**Speaker 1**: This is the original cost that was in.
**Jdawson**: Oh, okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: We ended up spending 30.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay, I got you.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So I'll just put key.
**Speaker 1**: You know, plug this up in here.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Just to kind of zero it out.
**Speaker 1**: And then the remaining will be profit.
**Speaker 1**: Would you say that there was a 22% margin on it?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, sounds about right.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Was this work done in 25 or 24?
**Jdawson**: I think this was a 24.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: This has been 20.
**Jdawson**: 24.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: I'm not sure why it's back on this thing on this WIP, but a call mark 24107.
**Speaker 1**: Look at that one.
**Speaker 1**: That one is in Procore.
**Speaker 1**: So contract seems okay.
**Speaker 1**: 385 budget is what?
**Jdawson**: So you're showing the revised contract.
**Speaker 1**: Revised contract.
**Speaker 1**: 348.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So 305, 43 changes and 348.
**Speaker 1**: 2.4.
**Speaker 1**: So the budget.
**Speaker 1**: I'm guessing this is the contract revenue.
**Jdawson**: Oh, boy.
**Speaker 1**: Back to revenue.
**Jdawson**: So, yeah, that's a bunch of costs that were charged to it after the fact.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, okay.
**Speaker 1**: So now it's sitting at a negative.
**Jdawson**: Let me see here.
**Speaker 1**: I'm showing a contract revenue after the buyer's budget is.
**Speaker 1**: Let's see.
**Speaker 1**: 39,870 and 31,659.97.
**Speaker 1**: So it would have been 35.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Speaker 1**: Now, if there's additional cost that hit it, I have to deduct it from here.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I mean, there's a hundred thousand charged.
**Jdawson**: The travel line.
**Speaker 1**: Exactly.
**Speaker 1**: A hundred thousand.
**Speaker 1**: Like 1015-9811-1015-9811.
**Jdawson**: Well, so, I mean, it looks to me like this job will lose because it's right now 141, 207.
**Jdawson**: The whole.
**Jdawson**: Minus the fee, that was 31,000.
**Jdawson**: 6:59.
**Speaker 1**: So 1.
**Speaker 1**: 141.
**Speaker 1**: 207.
**Jdawson**: I'm just seeing here.
**Jdawson**: Let's see.
**Jdawson**: Minus 1:6.9.
**Jdawson**: So that job's losing $109,547.92.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: So what else is charged to it?
**Speaker 1**: Or do we remove.
**Speaker 1**: Now, do we remove these completely?
**Speaker 1**: Because these are the contract original.
**Speaker 1**: Original contract revenue.
**Jdawson**: So the original contract revenue, minus the overages now.
**Speaker 1**: Yes.
**Speaker 1**: Which.
**Speaker 1**: The.
**Speaker 1**: The.
**Speaker 1**: The overages.
**Speaker 1**: I just have 101.
**Speaker 1**: Which.
**Speaker 1**: What else should I have in there?
**Jdawson**: Oh, like you wanted to add them all in.
**Jdawson**: I mean, there's every line here.
**Jdawson**: Like there's 40,000 in office supplies.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, all of those, huh?
**Speaker 1**: Everything in red.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I mean, there's a bunch.
**Jdawson**: So that's why marketing's 37,000.
**Jdawson**: That's what I'm saying.
**Jdawson**: Like, all these things were charged to this job.
**Jdawson**: And if you look at, you know, it's all credit card expenses.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: So, okay, total budget.
**Speaker 1**: So here's.
**Speaker 1**: Here's what I can do if I remove this 101.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: This was the original.
**Speaker 1**: Original.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So now we're 112 over.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I come up with 109 over.
**Jdawson**: So that's close.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Based.
**Speaker 1**: Based on the.
**Speaker 1**: Because the budget was 31.
**Speaker 1**: I mean, what's it called?
**Speaker 1**: 312 year to day charges 425.
**Jdawson**: First one of these.
**Speaker 1**: Should I add.
**Jdawson**: Like, there's one here forecast to complete.
**Jdawson**: That is.
**Jdawson**: It's manually entered.
**Speaker 1**: In.
**Speaker 1**: In procore.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So it was.
**Jdawson**: Instead of moving the money, they manually entered zero.
**Jdawson**: I'm not.
**Jdawson**: I don't want to mess with that.
**Jdawson**: But typically.
**Jdawson**: So there's.
**Jdawson**: It looks like there's some money in design development.
**Jdawson**: It's money.
**Jdawson**: So that's the only thing.
**Jdawson**: There's like 10,000 in there.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: That could potentially help that by 10,000.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: So I'm going to add over.
**Speaker 1**: Just how many did we say it was?
**Speaker 1**: 112, I believe.
**Speaker 1**: Let me see.
**Jdawson**: Well, minus the.
**Jdawson**: There's 10,000 in there.
**Jdawson**: That shouldn't be.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: The committed cost.
**Jdawson**: 188.
**Speaker 1**: 112587.
**Speaker 1**: And how much was the other cost?
**Jdawson**: The credit that's coming.
**Jdawson**: Yes, it should be.
**Jdawson**: There's an additional 10,000.
**Jdawson**: Exactly.
**Jdawson**: 10,000 even.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: 10,000 even.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: I don't think that's right.
**Speaker 1**: Hold on.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Speaker 1**: Technically, this should have been.
**Speaker 1**: Okay 112587.
**Jdawson**: But the 112587 should really be 102.
**Speaker 1**: 102.
**Speaker 1**: Yes.
**Speaker 1**: Yes.
**Speaker 1**: So I'm gonna put the 10,000 back in there.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: I just wanted to, you know, to kind of separate it.
**Speaker 1**: So looking back at it, I know what's.
**Jdawson**: What's.
**Jdawson**: What.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So here I'll add a comment.
**Jdawson**: And you see where that is on the budget.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: If you go down to 52.
**Jdawson**: 3,000.
**Speaker 1**: Yep, yep.
**Speaker 1**: I do see the 10,000 there.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Develop design development.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Speaker 1**: 112587 and 52 3000.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, 52, 3000.
**Speaker 1**: And that's design development.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: So that's still.
**Speaker 1**: It still shows that.
**Speaker 1**: So are you sure that wasn't used somewhere else?
**Speaker 1**: Because now we are 10,000.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, I know what to do here.
**Speaker 1**: I think this should have been this one 12, 587 includes the 10,000.
**Speaker 1**: So 102.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, no.
**Speaker 1**: I think it should be like 132 is actually the amount I think.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: The actual negative amount now is 132.
**Speaker 1**: Yes.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: 132.
**Speaker 1**: So this 10,000, we can decide if we want to reallocate that, like make the change or just act like it's not there.
**Jdawson**: Well, I can go in and change that to automatic to manual entry.
**Jdawson**: It'll change that if that's easier in Procore, you can just use the numbers.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: On there.
**Jdawson**: So let me change that.
**Speaker 1**: I think it is one.
**Speaker 1**: It's one, two, two.
**Speaker 1**: Because there's the 10,000.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Speaker 1**: It's one, two, Two.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: So it's zero here now.
**Jdawson**: See?
**Speaker 1**: Wow.
**Speaker 1**: So the job went from.
**Speaker 1**: If it was just the cost, it would have been.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Now it's like negative 22%.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And that's where like, who was this caught?
**Jdawson**: Who is this audit for?
**Speaker 1**: Nobody.
**Speaker 1**: We're just doing it.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: We're just doing it internally.
**Speaker 1**: So you guys get to see.
**Speaker 1**: Because I, I mean, you are.
**Speaker 1**: You're looking at the cost, but you kind of don't see the effect it has on.
**Speaker 1**: On like the financials.
**Speaker 1**: So I think monthly, before we present the financials, which we are working on June right now, I think it'll be helpful to kind of see where each job is.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Especially with the extra cost that's.
**Speaker 1**: That's hidden.
**Speaker 1**: That's not on the budget.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Speaker 1**: So I, we.
**Speaker 1**: We only went when went through the ones.
**Speaker 1**: I know had issues.
**Speaker 1**: But for example, let's look at Westville Collective.
**Speaker 1**: I know that one is a big.
**Speaker 1**: So contract.
**Speaker 1**: Is it the 9075 or 9255?
**Speaker 1**: The original contract.
**Jdawson**: Original was 9255.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, 9255.
**Speaker 1**: 275.
**Speaker 1**: And then it change orders.
**Jdawson**: So there's two different ones for Westfield.
**Jdawson**: Now there's this and the volleyball and the volleyball court one.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So that's probably what's making it look screwy is so when they split it up, they did a deductive change order for one point.
**Jdawson**: Let me see here.
**Speaker 1**: Is it 1.6?
**Jdawson**: Let's see.
**Jdawson**: Because now you got.
**Jdawson**: If you look in there, you've got two contracts.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, so there's another job for Westfield.
**Jdawson**: Exactly.
**Speaker 1**: Or is it all one job?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, 1.6 million.
**Jdawson**: So there's a deductive change order that created that 1.6 million dollar volleyball court project.
**Jdawson**: So they split it up.
**Jdawson**: And the lady that owns and runs the volleyball thing, that's her side.
**Jdawson**: And then the other guys have their food and restaurant side.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, so what is the job number for the volleyball court?
**Jdawson**: The volleyball is PC 240-30004.
**Jdawson**: There's still only one job number, but I guess I don't know if you can call it A and B.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, but it's still under.
**Speaker 1**: It's still kind of under one contract, which.
**Speaker 1**: The total contract is the 9.2 million.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Let's see.
**Jdawson**: Well, they're, you know, when they did this and they split them up, they didn't write, you know, make a new job or anything.
**Jdawson**: They just created a separate contract under this one job number, a separate owner contract.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: Okay, Planner, do you see them?
**Speaker 1**: Because, like, currently on my end, I see this.
**Speaker 1**: The two contracts, right?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So that 1.76 million has gone up now by 162,000 and change orders.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, but this is the total project between the two.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that should.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, so then that means I need to.
**Speaker 1**: Because I think the last time I updated this, it wasn't fixed in Job Planner, so it looked screwy.
**Speaker 1**: But that.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, you know, the total contract amount for Westfield is 9.2 million.
**Speaker 1**: And then the change orders looks like.
**Speaker 1**: Is there a negative change order?
**Jdawson**: Well, there was one negative that all that did was create the other contract.
**Jdawson**: They moved that money into the other contract.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, the $1,700,000.
**Jdawson**: Well, but her contract was set up for $1,600,000, I think with.
**Jdawson**: Oh, it's the grand total.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that's with her.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, so at the end of the day, what is the total change order?
**Speaker 1**: Do we take the 1.2 million, the negative 1.2, and you subtract the 781.7.
**Jdawson**: Well, the total change orders.
**Jdawson**: I think it just.
**Jdawson**: That should balance this up all out in the.
**Jdawson**: See here.
**Speaker 1**: So what is the.
**Speaker 1**: The total contract amount for Cedar?
**Jdawson**: I mean, which one are you on?
**Speaker 1**: I mean, Westfield Collective.
**Speaker 1**: What is the total total contract amount for Westfield Colle?
**Jdawson**: Where's the Procio's current total contract?
**Jdawson**: You're showing is 8, 6, 7, 4.
**Speaker 1**: So let me take this up.
**Speaker 1**: This is what was in there.
**Speaker 1**: The 9255.
**Speaker 1**: And we.
**Speaker 1**: There's a deductive change order for this, but it's not really.
**Speaker 1**: If you look at the overall contract, it's not really a deductive change order.
**Speaker 1**: It was just moving it to another item.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Speaker 1**: So if I was to add another job in here and say Westfield Collective B, then that will have the 1.7 million and the two will still equal the 9.2 million.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Well, one second here.
**Jdawson**: So our original contract was $7,473,275.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: That's what I have here.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: And then since then, that contract is added.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so showing a total between -1.7, plus all the ads.
**Jdawson**: 72, 0 root 63, 58.
**Jdawson**: So technically, the restaurant side has increased their scope and contract by 4185-524254-18552.
**Jdawson**: Let me look at something.
**Jdawson**: Let me look at this other one.
**Jdawson**: Now.
**Jdawson**: So we have this other one.
**Jdawson**: 62-408-19.
**Jdawson**: Started out 73, 70.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so between these two, currently the contract amount total for both of them is $8,054,235.61.
**Jdawson**: Is that where anything shows up on your spreadsheet?
**Speaker 1**: No, I didn't add anything to my spreadsheet.
**Speaker 1**: So this is what I started doing.
**Speaker 1**: So let's look at these two lines.
**Speaker 1**: So if we were to break this up, right, we deducted the 1.7 million from here and added it to the volleyball, right?
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so the.
**Jdawson**: So you can.
**Jdawson**: So the volleyball collective, you can make that so that when they're approved change orders for them have technically totaled an ad of, you know, the original contract is wrong.
**Jdawson**: Number one, the original contract was 747-3275.
**Speaker 1**: For this one, right?
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, so if I add these two up.
**Jdawson**: But that, that's not correct because approved change orders, in addition to that deductive, they've added 418 plus thousand.
**Jdawson**: So that's why, you know, that's why I can give you their, you know, forget what we took out to start that other, you know, or this is even a better way to say it.
**Jdawson**: So if their original contract, you know, when we wrote the first of the time, it was $7,473,275.
**Speaker 1**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: We backed out 1.782 million.
**Jdawson**: And then we added in 418,552.42.
**Jdawson**: That's their current contract amount.
**Speaker 1**: So you backed out 172 million out of the.
**Speaker 1**: You backed out 1.7 million out of the 7.4.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: So we, we started a 743275.
**Jdawson**: We deducted 1-782-000.
**Jdawson**: And then they added back in for their restaurant side alone, $418,552.42.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, so now their Contract for the restaurant alone is 6.1 million.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: $6,109,827.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So then they started out then at $1,782,000.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And then they've added in a total of $162,408.19 in added change order so far.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: So I'm going to do this and then I'm going to do 4, 1, 8.52 and 42 cents.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Those two equal 8,054,236.
**Jdawson**: Yep, yep.
**Jdawson**: That should be.
**Jdawson**: That's what I get.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, Lord.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Because that wouldn't make any sense because that's like we wouldn't go from 7 to $9 million when all we did is split the building up.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: All right.
**Speaker 1**: So we technically need to.
**Speaker 1**: But for in job planner, they all under one job.
**Jdawson**: That's for.
**Jdawson**: For the budget.
**Jdawson**: You know, you can't have two budgets.
**Jdawson**: I.
**Jdawson**: You have two owners in there, but it's all one budget.
**Jdawson**: And I think we did that to simplify things because we'd had to write, you know, we had subcontracts.
**Jdawson**: You know, none of those are split apart.
**Jdawson**: So all we have to do is just reconcile each month how each of these are performing.
**Jdawson**: And like, you know, the volleyball side, there's no general conditions in there.
**Jdawson**: There's.
**Jdawson**: I mean, they didn't.
**Jdawson**: They put.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, it's simply the cost of work.
**Jdawson**: And then the fee and insurance is the only things that that job started off or will make and change orders and etc.
**Jdawson**: Is just fee and insurance, fee and insurance.
**Speaker 1**: So on the budget side, it'll be the same.
**Jdawson**: Well, they have their own budgets too.
**Jdawson**: I mean, I could tell you the cost of work for that one is 1,600,000 even the original budget.
**Speaker 1**: Which one?
**Speaker 1**: For volleyball.
**Jdawson**: Volleyball, yeah.
**Speaker 1**: 600,000 even.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: And.
**Jdawson**: And so there's no other one.
**Speaker 1**: What is the contract revenue or the unallocated for that 1?
**Jdawson**: 1 million allocated for this one?
**Jdawson**: I don't think there's anything yet.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: What about contract revenue?
**Jdawson**: Contractor fee was 162,000.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And the insurance for that one was 20,000.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: I. I left it.
**Speaker 1**: I.
**Speaker 1**: You.
**Speaker 1**: I've been leaving.
**Speaker 1**: I'm gonna start leaving insurance in the budget.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jdawson**: Leave that off.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: All right.
**Speaker 1**: So what about the other one?
**Jdawson**: On the other one, I may have to do a little math here.
**Jdawson**: On the other one, our cost of work started.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So would have been sa.
**Jdawson**: Give me one second.
**Jdawson**: I'LL be right back.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: All right.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Sorry about that.
**Jdawson**: No problem.
**Jdawson**: Focus and figure this out.
**Jdawson**: So I have to take the original contract.
**Jdawson**: We have to deduct cost of work.
**Jdawson**: That includes all of our general conditions, correct?
**Speaker 1**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: We're going to take out original fee was 679.
**Speaker 1**: Going to eat my late lunch, if you don't mind, while you calculate that.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, this may take me a minute.
**Jdawson**: SA2 tendency video 34 minus SA.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so I'm showing the cost of work for the Westfield Collective should have been $4,980,034.
**Jdawson**: 4 million.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, so the original.
**Speaker 1**: Let's start with the original.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Speaker 1**: Would have been the 7473275, right?
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: And then approved change orders.
**Jdawson**: They had a total of 418,552.
**Jdawson**: 42 of positive.
**Jdawson**: And the negative was the 1.
**Jdawson**: 782.
**Jdawson**: 1.782 million was the deduct for the volleyball.
**Speaker 1**: So same thing we had here.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: And contract revenue.
**Speaker 1**: Is this correct?
**Speaker 1**: So we deducted 1.782 million and we added 418,000.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: So we took out of the fee.
**Jdawson**: Initially, out of that $679,000 fee, we took out 160,000 of it.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, so originally the fee was 6790-006790-00389.
**Jdawson**: Correct.
**Speaker 1**: 389.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: And we took out how much?
**Jdawson**: The 160,000 for the fee on the volleyball.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, okay.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, the fee on the volleyball is 160, 162,000 even.
**Jdawson**: Oh, you're missing a zero.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, so this minimum.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, so then what about.
**Speaker 1**: Was there any unallocated cost?
**Jdawson**: No, not.
**Jdawson**: There wasn't any on either of them currently or previously.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, so for the Westfield Collective, I'm showing estimated cost of 5.5 million.
**Jdawson**: Now, that should be 4.980.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, so then something is missing.
**Speaker 1**: So original budget, 4.743 approved change orders.
**Speaker 1**: We deducted 1.782 million and added the 4.418, 552.
**Jdawson**: Well, but you're saying original budget, that's what we're gonna.
**Jdawson**: We planned on spending on subs and everyone.
**Jdawson**: Correct.
**Jdawson**: So that.
**Jdawson**: That got reduced down to 4.980034 is the current budget.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, so, yeah, I'm just trying to back into how we got there.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, so we have the.
**Jdawson**: So if you want to do the formula, like the original budget.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Which is the 7.4 million.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Jdawson**: That was what we.
**Jdawson**: Well, that was the overall job cost.
**Jdawson**: But the original budget for what we planned on spending.
**Speaker 1**: Was how much?
**Jdawson**: $6,580,034.
**Speaker 1**: $6,580,034.
**Jdawson**: Oh, wait, wait one more second.
**Jdawson**: We were spending.
**Jdawson**: See, the original cost of work was going to be 6 million.
**Jdawson**: Sorry.
**Jdawson**: $6,793,886.
**Speaker 1**: 6,793,886.
**Jdawson**: Yes, that was the original budget.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: The estimated cost is $4,000,913 and 49.
**Speaker 1**: $913,049 currently.
**Speaker 1**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: That's close.
**Jdawson**: 4,980 is what I'm showing.
**Speaker 1**: All right, well, maybe I missed something here.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, so 6,793,886.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Speaker 1**: That's the original budget.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Speaker 1**: We deducted the 1.782 for the variable.
**Speaker 1**: 1.782 for the variable, and then we added 418,552.
**Speaker 1**: 42.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: And then we.
**Jdawson**: Oh, that's okay because it's the change orders.
**Jdawson**: So I didn't add up like the.
**Jdawson**: The current.
**Jdawson**: So all of the costs associated with.
**Jdawson**: You know, we had the change order for the ad, but, like, how do you incorporate?
**Jdawson**: Or is it just based on the current budget, like what our costs are?
**Jdawson**: I guess that'll be tough to.
**Speaker 1**: To identify.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, especially now.
**Jdawson**: There's one budget.
**Jdawson**: Two contracts would change orders and costs and.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, so in total, how much are we talking for Westfield?
**Jdawson**: In total?
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Let's see.
**Speaker 1**: Budget.
**Speaker 1**: Like the cost.
**Speaker 1**: Budget.
**Jdawson**: We're projecting costs of SA.
**Jdawson**: We're projecting between the two.
**Jdawson**: 6 million, 6, 86.
**Jdawson**: 9, 36.
**Speaker 1**: I currently have 6 million 6 million 3.
**Speaker 1**: 51.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So that.
**Jdawson**: It's missing those change orders, that added cost.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so between the two, like, we'd have to.
**Jdawson**: Let's see.
**Jdawson**: Of the added cost.
**Jdawson**: Here we go.
**Jdawson**: So the contractor fee through change orders.
**Jdawson**: Well, contractor fee went up by 52,084.
**Jdawson**: 52, 084.
**Jdawson**: Our insurance went up by 6430.
**Jdawson**: 20 if unallocated cost of 25,000 currently.
**Jdawson**: Then we have change orders totaling What?
**Jdawson**: Can you total those two up?
**Jdawson**: What are both over the change orders for each of those?
**Speaker 1**: Which one?
**Speaker 1**: These two?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, between those two.
**Jdawson**: See, I can.
**Jdawson**: I got it right here.
**Speaker 1**: It's 1,000,201.
**Jdawson**: Not really.
**Jdawson**: It's 400 418,552 plus 162 plus the 162.19 equals.
**Jdawson**: So we had 580,960.61 and change orders minus what we say we got in fee.
**Jdawson**: 522, 445.93.
**Jdawson**: So our added.
**Jdawson**: So adding to that cost.
**Jdawson**: And again, everything's in one budget for the fee in that.
**Jdawson**: But we're adding $522,445 worth of cost.
**Speaker 1**: Where to?
**Speaker 1**: Westfield or Volleyball?
**Jdawson**: Well, again, these I'd have to split up, change orders, but do it this way.
**Speaker 1**: It looks like I'm missing the 162, 408 here.
**Jdawson**: SA so roughly, we added $371,465 to the cost of the Westfield Collective restaurants.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, okay.
**Jdawson**: So the top one.
**Speaker 1**: So 300 and how much was.
**Jdawson**: Well, so this $371,465 was added to the cost of that job or the original.
**Jdawson**: The budget.
**Jdawson**: What you call the original budget.
**Speaker 1**: So the total.
**Jdawson**: But I mean it's not.
**Jdawson**: The approved CO was for 418,000 total of those.
**Jdawson**: But we're trying.
**Jdawson**: You're trying to just get the actual cost.
**Jdawson**: What that's going to cost us.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: So that's the 371.
**Jdawson**: 465 is approximately the cost.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: So the total is 6.7 million.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so now we take.
**Jdawson**: So on the volleyball side, the cost of we had162.08.
**Jdawson**: So their cost, the cost of us completing those change order work is an additional $144,137.
**Jdawson**: So between those two, if we, if we're close to the.
**Jdawson**: The cost of work of what are those two total?
**Speaker 1**: 6,866,000.
**Jdawson**: 6 million.
**Speaker 1**: Right here.
**Speaker 1**: 6,000,866.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: 8:66.
**Speaker 1**: Because the contract side, we have that one figured out.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Speaker 1**: So on the cost side for Westfield, we had the original 6,793,000.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Speaker 1**: And then we deducted the 1.782 million and then there was a change order of 418,000 5 2.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Speaker 1**: And then the additional 371,000 in cost.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Speaker 1**: 371,465.
**Jdawson**: And this in this column there you're in approved co. Is that simply to tell you how much additional cost?
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, yeah, that's just how much additional cost.
**Jdawson**: But is it.
**Jdawson**: So should the fee and insurance be included in that additional cost or are we trying to think about what this.
**Speaker 1**: That was already included in the budget.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Well, if not the added fee on a change order.
**Speaker 1**: Oh yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Then it should be included then.
**Jdawson**: Yes, it should okay, so then.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, because then we're not.
**Speaker 1**: Then we're not accounting for it if it's not in the original budget and if there's a change order, any fees that come with it should be all included in the cost.
**Jdawson**: Okay, yeah, yeah.
**Jdawson**: Then that's wrong.
**Jdawson**: It should be.
**Jdawson**: It should go back to the 1782.
**Speaker 1**: Right, right here.
**Speaker 1**: 1782.
**Jdawson**: That negative plus the 418, it should end up being the one.
**Jdawson**: The total negative is 1, 3, 6 3, 4, 7, 5 8.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And then hers would be the same.
**Jdawson**: It'd be 1 62, 4 08, 19.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And those two added together equals how much?
**Speaker 1**: Which ones?
**Speaker 1**: The total estimate now 6 million, 5 13.
**Jdawson**: And that's the estimate of what it'll cost to finish.
**Speaker 1**: Yes, yes.
**Speaker 1**: Considering we remove the expected contract revenue.
**Jdawson**: But that doesn't make sense because our total contract's $8 million now.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, contract, yeah, the total contract is.
**Speaker 1**: Is 8 million, which is right.
**Speaker 1**: Right here.
**Speaker 1**: So this is the contract.
**Speaker 1**: This is the cost to complete budget on this side.
**Speaker 1**: So the total contract is 8 million right here.
**Speaker 1**: These two added up 8 million.
**Speaker 1**: The budget.
**Speaker 1**: We are saying that the budget is, you know, all the same.
**Speaker 1**: But there's 517,000 in contract revenue on Westfield.
**Speaker 1**: Is that correct?
**Speaker 1**: Because originally it was.
**Speaker 1**: You said 679, and then we deducted 162,000.
**Speaker 1**: Because that's what we moved here.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, we've moved 162,000 here.
**Speaker 1**: So the total contract revenue for two for both line items is 679,000.
**Speaker 1**: So.
**Jdawson**: But where are those total costs coming from?
**Jdawson**: Like total.
**Jdawson**: Like right there, where you're at right now.
**Speaker 1**: This is original budget plus the approved change orders.
**Speaker 1**: Plus the allocated cost.
**Speaker 1**: No, minus the unallocated cost, minus the contract revenue.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Because all of those are currently.
**Speaker 1**: If I, If I was to pull up the budget, the unallocated cost and the contract revenue are already included in that budget.
**Jdawson**: I'm looking.
**Jdawson**: I'm not adding it all up.
**Jdawson**: That's my fault.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So all that adds up to column O and column N together equals our 8 million 54.
**Speaker 1**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: Thousand.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Because if I, If I did not include these.
**Jdawson**: There'S still only 7.1 million.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, hold on.
**Speaker 1**: That's.
**Speaker 1**: I mean, I think the issue is here.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Here.
**Speaker 1**: Because you said that the original budget was 679, not 7.4.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Original contract, 74.
**Speaker 1**: Because normally, from what I've seen in the system, the original contract and the original budget always match.
**Speaker 1**: From what I've Noticed in the system, original contract and original budget always match.
**Speaker 1**: It's the, when we deduct the contract revenue, that's when we get the real cost budget.
**Speaker 1**: But for this one, for some reason, we have a different original budget.
**Speaker 1**: If we change this, let's just try this.
**Speaker 1**: If we change this to the 74, 73 to 75, that changes now budget to complete this job.
**Jdawson**: The other one should be one 782, not one six.
**Speaker 1**: On 782.
**Speaker 1**: Which one?
**Jdawson**: On the original budget for the volleyball.
**Speaker 1**: So this one should be 1782.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, so now budget is 7.3 million.
**Jdawson**: Which would add those all together.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, add everything together.
**Jdawson**: There we go.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I got you.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I know it gets, it gets, gets confusing what I'm gonna do with these.
**Speaker 1**: I might add a, add another line, hide those two and just have a total line with the cost.
**Speaker 1**: Because since the cost to date and the revenue and the billed items are only going to be shown on that one job, that Westfield Collective.
**Jdawson**: Well, we have, we're doing two billings.
**Speaker 1**: But they both being built to that same 25 job.
**Speaker 1**: Yes.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Gotcha.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that makes sense.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: If we had known, we would have, would have created a new job and name it a, you know, well, there.
**Jdawson**: Again, like, I guess if it's only for billing.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: But I can work it out on my end.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I can work it out on my end.
**Speaker 1**: So which, any, any other specific one you want me to look at?
**Jdawson**: Not at 6 o' clock at night.
**Jdawson**: If you got another Westfield.
**Jdawson**: How you want to look at it?
**Jdawson**: I think that's like that.
**Speaker 1**: So that's the only one like that.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: All right.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, I, I, I keep forgetting that you, you are on Eastern time.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, so what I'll do is I'll, I'll update all of these.
**Speaker 1**: I'll go in, look at the budgets, look at everything, make sure that all the budgets and everything are match what's in job planner on my end.
**Speaker 1**: And then if you have some available time tomorrow, maybe for like half an hour, we can just run through it one more time.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: No, if everything else makes sense, like if the stuff is highlighted in orange, is that an issue?
**Jdawson**: Like.
**Speaker 1**: No, this stuff that's highlighted was just stuff that, that stood out to me while I was looking at it.
**Speaker 1**: And I kind of wanted to either we look at it together or just I dig into it on, on my own.
**Speaker 1**: Like these, I'm just missing, you know, contract and the budgets.
**Speaker 1**: That's why I added them In.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, so those are just easy things that I just wanted to update.
**Speaker 1**: But my main thing here is to make sure that none of these show over 100% because that means that we have either built or accrued or incurred more cost than the budget and we don't want that.
**Speaker 1**: So we've updated most of them.
**Speaker 1**: We've updated all of them.
**Speaker 1**: Everything down here should be 100% because they are under the completed section.
**Speaker 1**: And only thing I would say is on these items we just need to confirm or I need to go through it and update it one, one more time just to show that we, we've built everything.
**Speaker 1**: I'm sure I just need to update the budget, the contract and the budget to match because I haven't updated these and all of these should be zero.
**Speaker 1**: We should not have any remaining cost or remaining, you know, remaining revenue to be built if the job is hundred percent complete.
**Speaker 1**: Usually there's like remaining.
**Speaker 1**: Sometimes you'll see remaining costs, but that just means that you probably saved money, you know, somewhere.
**Speaker 1**: And we just need to update that.
**Jdawson**: Line item to match where you get that information.
**Jdawson**: You're getting.
**Jdawson**: When you look at the report, if you see any forecast to complete money out there, you're saying it's.
**Jdawson**: That's, Is that where you're getting that information?
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, so, so this, these are all formula based.
**Speaker 1**: So what this column is doing, it's going to take the estimate or.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, it's going to take the estimated cost to complete and it is comparing it to the cost to date that's in.
**Jdawson**: So Goodwill Excel Center.
**Speaker 1**: Let me look at that 1 24, 11 3.
**Speaker 1**: Was that in Procore?
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: Find it here.
**Speaker 1**: Is it closed completely?
**Speaker 1**: I don't see it in Procore.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah, it's down in.
**Speaker 1**: Oh 24.
**Jdawson**: I opened it up.
**Speaker 1**: Oh 23, 11 4.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, okay.
**Speaker 1**: Goodwill Excel Center.
**Jdawson**: Okay, if I look on here.
**Speaker 1**: So.
**Jdawson**: If we go where is that, where is 1749?
**Jdawson**: No.
**Jdawson**: $646.
**Jdawson**: Where is that coming from on this cost report?
**Speaker 1**: So that is a calculated cost.
**Speaker 1**: So we have to verify other things.
**Speaker 1**: Like if we, if I go to the budget, I go to the budget and it shows.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, see that means I need to update the budget because the revised.
**Speaker 1**: Let's see, something was off with this one because it said that the Original budget was 1.340, 1.553 and then approved change order.
**Speaker 1**: So the Revised budget was 2,340,000.
**Speaker 1**: Is that correct?
**Jdawson**: Well, that's what it shows.
**Jdawson**: We had a lot of change orders.
**Jdawson**: But see here.
**Jdawson**: Original budget 787,000.
**Jdawson**: 787,000 is the change order amounts on the left side of this.
**Speaker 1**: The budget.
**Speaker 1**: Change order I got.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, go this, go that way.
**Jdawson**: So it was.
**Jdawson**: You said you're showing 2, 3 49, 3994 is the revised budget.
**Jdawson**: And you show a little different there.
**Jdawson**: 2340939.
**Jdawson**: You show nine.
**Jdawson**: No, you show 940.
**Speaker 1**: Where.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, it's rounded.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: It's rounded.
**Speaker 1**: It's rounded.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So on the cost budget, I didn't.
**Speaker 1**: On this one, I didn't take out the contract items.
**Speaker 1**: So maybe if I was to put in here, same thing.
**Speaker 1**: Let's say 5, 5, 3, 282 change order 787657 94.
**Speaker 1**: And then in the unallocated.
**Speaker 1**: There's no unallocated.
**Speaker 1**: It's all contract revenue.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Speaker 1**: Of five, seven and seven.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: There's this.
**Speaker 1**: So that the web really would show total estimate of 1 million 7 63.
**Speaker 1**: But bill to date is 1 million 7 50.
**Speaker 1**: So we have $13,000 in remaining cost.
**Speaker 1**: That according.
**Speaker 1**: According to this.
**Speaker 1**: So if we look in here, Forecast to complete estimated the completion.
**Speaker 1**: How do we see what's left on here?
**Jdawson**: Well, I'm looking at invoicing.
**Jdawson**: I mean, unless this got messed up, you know, I know they used.
**Jdawson**: Well, no, that wasn't this job.
**Jdawson**: We show billing number nine.
**Speaker 1**: And this cost of revenue, that's 646.
**Speaker 1**: Let me.
**Speaker 1**: If I leave everything the way it was.
**Speaker 1**: 646 was incurred in 2020.
**Jdawson**: 2020.
**Speaker 1**: It shows cost to date.
**Speaker 1**: So the 646 may have been some invoice that hit the job out of nowhere in 2025.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So since it's a closed job, if I was to add 646 in here, it zeros it out.
**Speaker 1**: So since it was an invoice that hit, we just have to kind of update the budget on.
**Speaker 1**: On.
**Speaker 1**: On the sheet to pick that up.
**Speaker 1**: And it's a close job to zero it out.
**Jdawson**: I guess.
**Jdawson**: I still don't see.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, the budget doesn't match.
**Speaker 1**: And I think part of that reason will be with the procore items.
**Speaker 1**: Some of the direct costs wasn't hidden.
**Speaker 1**: The labor wasn't loaded on time.
**Speaker 1**: So there were a lot of things happening with the procore jobs.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: But I'll clean this up.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: It's not right.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: I'll make all the updates and we'll.
**Speaker 1**: I'll see what time you.
**Speaker 1**: What availability you have tomorrow.
**Speaker 1**: And we'll look at it.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, tomorrow.
**Jdawson**: I got stuff all day in the afternoon.
**Jdawson**: When's our accounting meeting too?
**Speaker 1**: Yes, I believe so.
**Jdawson**: So we could do it like one.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Or maybe after the meeting.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, earlier.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I'm okay with with either time.
**Speaker 1**: 1:30 your time.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, 1:30 or 12.
**Speaker 1**: See what I.
**Speaker 1**: What I have tomorrow.
**Jdawson**: Or if you don't need this for the meeting, we can just do it after.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I don't need it.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I don't need it for the meeting.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I don't need it for the meeting.
**Speaker 1**: But if, if, if I have everything updated and we can look at it, you know, before the meeting, we can.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, maybe Brandon needs to see how these.
**Speaker 1**: This travel cost affecting some of these jobs.
**Speaker 1**: Well, I don't know if that's something you want to discuss with him later on, but this will be pretty.
**Speaker 1**: It's not hard to read.
**Speaker 1**: Usually when everything is done, you just hide these columns so you have the original.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And all I'm saying is if we do need an audit, like we needed for.
**Jdawson**: Can't remember what it was for.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, but like that doesn't look good on a job.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, when it's not a real thing.
**Speaker 1**: A real thing.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, definitely.
**Speaker 1**: What.
**Speaker 1**: What job was that?
**Jdawson**: Or Mark Atlanta.
**Speaker 1**: Omar.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, it definitely did bring down the.
**Speaker 1**: The gross profit a little bit more than.
**Speaker 1**: Than usual.
**Jdawson**: Well, it was.
**Jdawson**: It's losing money, is it not?
**Jdawson**: Maybe it wasn't corn.
**Jdawson**: Which other job?
**Speaker 1**: I don't think it was.
**Speaker 1**: It was Comarch.
**Speaker 1**: Wait, which coma was.
**Jdawson**: Was like a minus 22% or something?
**Jdawson**: I thought.
**Speaker 1**: I added comments in another one that had.
**Speaker 1**: Comment got deleted.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, this is confusing right here.
**Speaker 1**: It was comarch SLC Salt Lake City.
**Jdawson**: Oh, okay.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Speaker 1**: And it is losing money.
**Speaker 1**: It's the 22,000.
**Speaker 1**: I mean, not 22,000.
**Speaker 1**: Negative 22%.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Yep.
**Speaker 1**: They'll definitely ask about that.
**Speaker 1**: So is there a reason they don't get put into the jobs with the higher margin?
**Jdawson**: You know, I don't know.
**Jdawson**: That's all I was asking.
**Jdawson**: Maybe he was just in a.
**Jdawson**: In a hurry and thought everything would get covered in that.
**Jdawson**: I'm just not sure.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, and maybe this is, you know, this is something you want to review with.
**Speaker 1**: With him also after it's all cleaned up, you guys just look at it.
**Speaker 1**: Because one thing I do with a lot of my clients is when we, when we update the WIP to show them where all the jobs are, we send it over to them, they review it with the Project managers, they review it with the internal team.
**Speaker 1**: And let's say for example, e.g.
**Speaker 1**: cEVA, right.
**Speaker 1**: The budget may currently be showing of, you know like a 45%, 45% gross margin.
**Speaker 1**: Or here if we look at job to date job today it shows that we are looking at 45% GP.
**Speaker 1**: But we do know that there's major cost that's about to hit.
**Speaker 1**: So we can just say that okay, we are about to incur cost on this line item.
**Speaker 1**: Go ahead.
**Speaker 1**: Or if you know that you have pending change orders that are waiting for, you know, the owner's approval, you can say okay, go ahead and add those change orders in on the sheet.
**Speaker 1**: We won't update it yet in job planner but go ahead and add it on the sheet and if you have any costs, okay, go ahead and accrue the cost on this sheet.
**Speaker 1**: Let me see where that puts.
**Speaker 1**: Put, puts me or say, okay, that job is really going to end at like 20% gross margin.
**Speaker 1**: We're behind on costs, we're behind on like change orders.
**Speaker 1**: Go ahead and change it on this sheet.
**Speaker 1**: So I can see where, where that will land me.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I'm going have to study the sheet.
**Jdawson**: There's a lot of things on there.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: You'Re like in the matrix.
**Jdawson**: It all makes sense to you.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, because I created it.
**Speaker 1**: But job plan, I mean Acumatica also has one and, and I, I think we, we should give you access to Acumatica just to be able to see reports and read the reports.
**Speaker 1**: Acumatica also has a whiff.
**Speaker 1**: I'm not the biggest fan of it.
**Speaker 1**: Maybe because it wasn't as clean.
**Speaker 1**: There were a lot of open jobs in there.
**Speaker 1**: But if you go to project width, if you want to run it as.
**Jdawson**: Of.
**Speaker 1**: Let'S say June.
**Speaker 1**: Oh okay, let's, let's do June because that's the month we're closing.
**Speaker 1**: So actual cost, we just want to show actual cost to June.
**Speaker 1**: And you run the report.
**Speaker 1**: This is what it looks like.
**Speaker 1**: It gives you.
**Speaker 1**: So basically the same thing.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Contract amounts, estimate commitments.
**Speaker 1**: This one actually gives you the commitments.
**Speaker 1**: Original approved change orders pending change orders revised and then actuals from the date range you are looking at.
**Speaker 1**: So projected.
**Speaker 1**: You know, it gives you everything.
**Speaker 1**: The period costs, period billings, cost to period job cost up to that date range.
**Speaker 1**: You ran it for revenue billing to period.
**Speaker 1**: So it gives you all of that.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, yeah.
**Speaker 1**: And then remain in remaining contract.
**Speaker 1**: I think some of these are, I don't, I think we need to kind of remove.
**Speaker 1**: We've deactivated a lot of the old jobs that are closed out and if they are in.
**Speaker 1**: If they're closed or started in 2025, we left them in there.
**Speaker 1**: We only deactivate them when we're sure that the job is complete and they need to be removed off of the web.
**Speaker 1**: And the good thing about the Acumatica one is you can double click in it.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: If you can print that or just download that.
**Jdawson**: I think I have access to.
**Jdawson**: To that.
**Jdawson**: It's just something else I don't have time to get into.
**Jdawson**: But yeah, that would help at the my.
**Jdawson**: At the end of the month to review that.
**Jdawson**: I mean that.
**Speaker 1**: To review it.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And that.
**Jdawson**: That I'm putting in a bunch of info I wouldn't need to really do for my PSRs.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, that is true.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: And you can download it in Excel also.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: All right, well, thank you for your time and our turn to two, but I think we got a.
**Speaker 1**: We got a lot covered.
**Speaker 1**: So I'll.
**Speaker 1**: I'll update it and then we'll talk tomorrow.
**Jdawson**: All right, sounds good.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: All right, thank you, bye.
