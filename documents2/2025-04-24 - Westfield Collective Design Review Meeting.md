## Transcript
**Bclymer**: Good morning.
**Jdawson**: Good morning.
**Nbigler**: All right, we got about everybody here.
**Nbigler**: Micah and Ashton jump on.
**Nbigler**: Other than that, looks like we got everybody.
**Nbigler**: Can you guys hear me?
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Awoodhams**: Yep.
**Gdesmit**: Okay.
**Nbigler**: Good morning.
**Ashton**: Hey Glenn, this is Joe.
**Ashton**: Thanks for clarifying that question on those rigid inclusions on the CNC shop drawings.
**Ashton**: That one had me baffled.
**Nbigler**: Yeah.
**Nbigler**: Oh, the.
**Nbigler**: Yeah, the concrete appears.
**Ashton**: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Nbigler**: Yeah.
**Nbigler**: We were trying to come up with a way we didn't want to relocate after we'd already done all the work to figure out where to put that grease trap and so.
**Nbigler**: So was a nice easy fix that they offered for us.
**Nbigler**: Okay.
**Nbigler**: So we are pretty much through the civil drawing phase at this point.
**Nbigler**: Citizens has approved our sanitary and our gas and water plans and stamped them.
**Nbigler**: But they then go to some admin department who puts them together into a link, sends them out for payment and that takes up to 14 business days.
**Nbigler**: And so we are waiting for that to come through so we can pay and then we will get started on sanitary and water.
**Nbigler**: Item is in possession of their.
**Nbigler**: Their permit.
**Nbigler**: We're still good to go on that.
**Nbigler**: And then we'll send that to Ashton at some point and then Center Point Energy has a ticket in to get this gas standpipe out here removed probably by mid next week.
**Nbigler**: Is.
**Nbigler**: Is the date they gave Chads, hopefully before that.
**Nbigler**: But that's pretty much it for the civil stuff.
**Nbigler**: Anybody have anything chip in for civil for any of our site work going on?
**Nbigler**: Underground utilities under Slab Utilities instructional design.
**Nbigler**: So Jerrica and Joe and the team got the shot drawings reviewed and turned back around to cnc.
**Nbigler**: So those went back flame yesterday.
**Nbigler**: They are on schedule to begin Monday weather pending at this point.
**Nbigler**: We're building the pad out there currently today.
**Nbigler**: It's the one thing that LE Master is now waiting on is the stair notice, maybe calculations or at least a letter saying that the beam that they're going to provide a sufficient to hold the stairs that we're installing.
**Nbigler**: Joe, is that something that.
**Nbigler**: Roger.
**Nbigler**: What can we get Lee Master?
**Ashton**: I'm running those calcs now.
**Ashton**: I'll provide point loads to Varco Prudin so that they can verify their design.
**Ashton**: There'll be conservative point loads.
**Ashton**: So go ahead.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, and just for clarification, we are not checking the beam that Leamaster or VP is providing.
**Jdawson**: We will provide them the loads so that they can check their design.
**Brhoades**: Yeah, that's correct.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah.
**Brhoades**: Rocco Prudent has to size the beams.
**Brhoades**: They just need all the information as.
**Brhoades**: As you know.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Jdawson**: So we'll.
**Jdawson**: We'll get those Loads over, provide them as point loads so that, that can be checked.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Brhoades**: So the landing is going to get what, how many columns, Glenn?
**Brhoades**: It's gonna get two or four or depends on the stair, I guess.
**Brhoades**: I was thinking the main stair, but you know, the, all the stairs obviously are a little bit different.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I think we were anticipating two columns at the landing.
**Jdawson**: Jeff, correct me if I'm wrong because I believe we did chat about this at some point.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I think that that was actually what I was going to bring up.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: So why don't Joe, why don't you, me and Jerrica hop on a call sometime later today and we can make sure that we are all on the same page for where these are going to be.
**Bclymer**: Because I agree.
**Bclymer**: I think there should be two at every landing on the back side.
**Nbigler**: Sounds good here, right, Jeff?
**Bclymer**: Correct.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Nbigler**: That's the, that's the guidance I gave to the, the stair supplier too.
**Gdesmit**: So.
**Gdesmit**: Okay.
**Nbigler**: They just, they just weren't.
**Nbigler**: They have to detail out the whole stairs before they could give me any weights or calculations or anything like that.
**Nbigler**: So all the guidance they were able to give me is that, you know, they, they hook these stairs up to, to 12 inch beams all the time and they know that they work, work with that with the self supporting legs here.
**Gdesmit**: So.
**Nbigler**: Is everybody on the same page about how the L stair is being shifted?
**Nbigler**: Done some emails back and forth about it.
**Nbigler**: And Jeff had made the markup.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: We can go ahead and shift that in our drawing if, if we agree that.
**Bclymer**: That that's the right direction.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: So we'll just shift it over 1 foot 2.
**Bclymer**: Nick.
**Nbigler**: Yep, that's what I told Varco.
**Nbigler**: Yep.
**Gdesmit**: Okay.
**Awoodhams**: All right, so it's, it's not centered.
**Awoodhams**: It's not centered anymore.
**Gdesmit**: Yeah.
**Nbigler**: This is the L, right on the.
**Awoodhams**: Oh, this is the exterior, the exterior one.
**Awoodhams**: But the interior one we're able to center, correct?
**Brhoades**: That is correct.
**Nbigler**: Yep.
**Awoodhams**: All right, thank you, Nick.
**Awoodhams**: I'm glad that you were able to sober up and get that done.
**Brhoades**: Absolutely.
**Brhoades**: It's what I do.
**Gdesmit**: So.
**Nbigler**: Yeah, Brandon, they were able to.
**Nbigler**: They removed these two columns here centered up the stairs.
**Nbigler**: And then this column that was in the beer wall, they were able to get out of there as well.
**Nbigler**: These two columns here on, on the patio had to stay.
**Nbigler**: But that's okay.
**Nbigler**: Everything got to the cnc.
**Awoodhams**: The beer column wall was, if memory serves me, correct.
**Awoodhams**: It's that the, those columns were protruding outside the wall.
**Awoodhams**: Correct?
**Nbigler**: Yeah.
**Awoodhams**: And that now they're not protruding outside the wall.
**Awoodhams**: Anymore.
**Nbigler**: They're not there.
**Nbigler**: It's not there anymore.
**Awoodhams**: Perfect.
**Nbigler**: So that takes care of those three.
**Nbigler**: These two being added is no big deal.
**Nbigler**: MERA is accounted for it.
**Nbigler**: And cnc.
**Nbigler**: JQL got it in their shop drawings and got back to CNC yesterday on time.
**Nbigler**: So we're good.
**Nbigler**: And then.
**Nbigler**: Yeah.
**Nbigler**: This is the last thing where this beam was running through the stairs.
**Nbigler**: Beam 36 here.
**Nbigler**: So everybody's on the same page with that.
**Nbigler**: And anchor rods are approved.
**Nbigler**: When can these.
**Nbigler**: Was.
**Nbigler**: Was there any change to the anchor rods?
**Nbigler**: I guess just the count, Right?
**Nbigler**: You already had a D3 anchor rod in your shop drawings.
**Nbigler**: So just the count of the extra two for these two columns.
**Nbigler**: Nick, on your base plate on your anchor rod.
**Nbigler**: Yeah.
**Brhoades**: The number of anchor bolts.
**Brhoades**: Obviously.
**Brhoades**: I've got that Varco Prudent.
**Brhoades**: They determine how many bolts and what the diameter is.
**Brhoades**: All I need is, you know, the different lengths of embedment, whether that's a universal rule or.
**Nbigler**: Hey.
**Brhoades**: The big columns need an embedding of this and the shape of the anchor rods.
**Brhoades**: So right now, typically lead times for anchor bolts are three to five business days.
**Brhoades**: So if Merit wants those on site on 5 12.
**Brhoades**: I'll just need to know the lengths.
**Brhoades**: Whenever JQOL is done with their.
**Brhoades**: I'm assuming their permit set would include that.
**Brhoades**: So.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we've.
**Jdawson**: We've been working through the embedments and we can have that updated.
**Brhoades**: Perfect.
**Brhoades**: Thank you.
**Nbigler**: Go back to structural steel.
**Nbigler**: When.
**Nbigler**: When are.
**Nbigler**: When are you going to have the updated set?
**Nbigler**: Jerrica, you're updated and updated set.
**Nbigler**: Are.
**Nbigler**: Are you updating a set at this point?
**Nbigler**: Your foundations already had those two columns added onto it already.
**Nbigler**: The ones that we have now.
**Jdawson**: Yes, we.
**Jdawson**: Our most recent set had matched the anchor bolt drawings of the VP drawings.
**Jdawson**: So we can remove the two that columns that are getting removed and provide the anchor rod information.
**Nbigler**: You're saying we still have two footers on here that are yet that you.
**Jdawson**: Still have to remove based on coordination?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So those two other end.
**Gdesmit**: It.
**Jdawson**: It's so confusing.
**Jdawson**: Our drawings are in different orientations.
**Nbigler**: Well, here's their.
**Nbigler**: Do we have.
**Jdawson**: I guess we just need to shift those.
**Awoodhams**: Do we have an.
**Awoodhams**: One thing I've seen on these drawings.
**Awoodhams**: I don't know whose they are.
**Awoodhams**: I do not see.
**Awoodhams**: Where's our north arrow that shoot.
**Awoodhams**: That's pretty important.
**Nbigler**: It's not on this drawing.
**Nbigler**: But north is the bottom of the page on this one.
**Nbigler**: Who's.
**Awoodhams**: Whose drawing is this?
**Nbigler**: This is Nick.
**Awoodhams**: Do you think you could have them give us A north arrow.
**Awoodhams**: Especially if we're not going to keep the same orientation throughout different disciplines.
**Awoodhams**: That's incredibly important because all it takes is, you know, one mistake.
**Awoodhams**: And I mean, this thing, if you're looking at it from the south or you can afford the north, like, you can make a simple mistake.
**Awoodhams**: So is there a way that if they're updating these drawings, we add a north arrow and it should be for all disciplines?
**Brhoades**: Yeah.
**Awoodhams**: Thank you.
**Brhoades**: To make that happen, Gwen.
**Awoodhams**: That should be in.
**Awoodhams**: Everybody that's on our team.
**Awoodhams**: For every project moving forward, there should be zero drawing that does not have a north arrow on it.
**Awoodhams**: It's just.
**Awoodhams**: It's too simple and it avoids mistakes.
**Nbigler**: Yes.
**Ashton**: Right now, currently, Brandon, ours, we have the north arrow shown, but it is oriented up.
**Ashton**: Usually on plans, north is always up.
**Ashton**: So if that's incorrect, we need to, you know, we didn't match wherever the heck north is relative to the building.
**Ashton**: I agree.
**Ashton**: Because it's.
**Ashton**: It's.
**Ashton**: If you've ever been in that position where they've laid out the foundations opposite.
**Awoodhams**: I can honestly tell you, I.
**Awoodhams**: I've learned this because I know it's gonna.
**Awoodhams**: Listen, I know this is going to shock everybody.
**Awoodhams**: I make mistakes.
**Awoodhams**: I know it's crazy.
**Awoodhams**: But look, I'm not.
**Awoodhams**: Jesus.
**Awoodhams**: I'm close, but not there.
**Awoodhams**: And I've made this mistake literally laying out of hospital before because we had planned north, which is what you're talking about, Joe, and it wasn't true north.
**Awoodhams**: So everything should be true north.
**Awoodhams**: Plan north is always just something we say is orientation.
**Awoodhams**: But.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah, so that if that north sign is not accurate, then we need to make sure it points directly, which I think that one probably is actually.
**Awoodhams**: But, yeah, make sure we're using true north arrows.
**Bclymer**: The structural and architecturals and MEPs are all orientated with NorthUP.
**Bclymer**: I think Nick VP is the only one that has it reversed.
**Gdesmit**: Yeah.
**Nbigler**: Yeah.
**Nbigler**: So back to VPs.
**Nbigler**: Jerrica, which one?
**Nbigler**: Which two columns on what?
**Nbigler**: Either your foundation set are being removed or the steel set.
**Ashton**: I don't think they're being removed, Glenn.
**Ashton**: I think they're just being shifted.
**Ashton**: Shifting for that.
**Ashton**: Those two in the middle there for the stairs.
**Ashton**: Like we had those underneath.
**Ashton**: Yeah.
**Ashton**: So those just need to shift to pick up the.
**Ashton**: Since there are no longer VP columns there, those need to shift up to pick up the stair columns at the landing.
**Ashton**: You know what I'm saying?
**Ashton**: When we know where.
**Ashton**: When we know where they're.
**Ashton**: When we know where those are at.
**Ashton**: And that was marked up on the cnc.
**Ashton**: Submittal.
**Nbigler**: Yes.
**Nbigler**: Yeah.
**Nbigler**: We'll coordinate out of the field.
**Nbigler**: However, these.
**Nbigler**: These are not getting.
**Nbigler**: These are just thick and slab.
**Nbigler**: This isn't getting a footer or appear under it.
**Nbigler**: Correct.
**Ashton**: It does get peers.
**Ashton**: It's a thick and slab portion, but it does get.
**Ashton**: It does get a peer, if I remember correctly.
**Nbigler**: Yep, there it is.
**Nbigler**: Okay.
**Nbigler**: So when you marked up the submittal, send it back.
**Nbigler**: We didn't move.
**Nbigler**: Did you make a note on this?
**Nbigler**: I don't have to go.
**Ashton**: Yes.
**Ashton**: Yeah.
**Ashton**: I indicate.
**Ashton**: I indicated that those needed to move well up plan north, whatever you want to call it, and that we needed to verify that with the final steel shops, wherever they.
**Ashton**: Wherever they are going to be, wherever that is.
**Ashton**: And maybe that's part of the conversation we have with Jeff later.
**Jfield**: I don't know.
**Nbigler**: So I'm having a hard time visualing this L Stairs.
**Nbigler**: This is.
**Nbigler**: We got the bottom of the stair here.
**Nbigler**: We come up, here's the landing, and then it hooks.
**Nbigler**: Right.
**Nbigler**: What is.
**Nbigler**: What is this lap.
**Nbigler**: What is this other one here?
**Ashton**: I think those were columns that were still left in place.
**Ashton**: Now, if those are gone, if all of the columns associated with Varco Prudin are gone with regard to the stair openings, then we can remove those.
**Ashton**: But I wasn't clear on which for sure.
**Ashton**: Varco Prudent columns were being removed to account for stair openings.
**Nbigler**: So that's the bottom of the stair here.
**Nbigler**: So this is landing.
**Nbigler**: There's no.
**Nbigler**: I mean, the stair.
**Nbigler**: The stairs will add a column there.
**Nbigler**: Jeff, where would you have us do that?
**Bclymer**: I mean, this one is interesting because there's already a column in that corner.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: So that D3, that's at the corner of 55 and 54.
**Bclymer**: Like those two small columns that are all going to shift in one foot two.
**Bclymer**: It doesn't feel like there needs to be an additional.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, like it doesn't feel like there needs to be an additional column here.
**Bclymer**: Joe, just because that extra run so small.
**Nbigler**: Do you think one there?
**Nbigler**: I don't know.
**Ashton**: Yeah, I wasn't clear, but I wanted to make sure that, you know, part of it was.
**Ashton**: I wasn't clear precisely on where the columns were and weren't falling and whether they were stair columns or vp.
**Ashton**: It looked like VP was providing a column at each of the beam start and stop points.
**Ashton**: So that's what we've accounted found additional concrete 4 and CNC Piers 4.
**Ashton**: So if those go away or if those change or something like that, but at least we'll have it accounted for in the foundation.
**Ashton**: If they Go away, then we don't have to account for it.
**Ashton**: But I wanted to make sure something was there to account for it.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, Nick, if you go back.
**Bclymer**: Sorry, Glenn, if you go back to that.
**Bclymer**: Did you get confirmation from BP whether or not they were good to run that B54 all the way down and get rid of that column at the bottom of the stair?
**Bclymer**: Or are they going to.
**Bclymer**: Is the plan right now that they feel that they need to keep it?
**Brhoades**: They said that right now that they can change it if we want.
**Brhoades**: Which is kind of what I was alluding to my email a couple days ago.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Brhoades**: That, hey, if we're going to mess with this, this framed opening right now, if you guys want to change right now is the time.
**Brhoades**: And then Glenn's like, hey, let's just.
**Brhoades**: Let's just do what Jeff said and just move it over and keep the L shape.
**Brhoades**: So I think what they said is just let us know what you want us to do.
**Gdesmit**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So I guess Brandon and Glenn, the B54.
**Bclymer**: When I talked with Nick, the goal when we were talking was it's still going to be an L regardless, because we can't do the landing in the middle of the run and get like an actual landing at the top and bottom.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Just because of the rest of the steel.
**Bclymer**: But the thought was to get rid of BM53 so that you didn't have a column at the bottom of the stair and just run 54 all the way down to L.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah, I, I thought that that's what we were doing was taking that all the way and just doing a T into that.
**Awoodhams**: If the.
**Awoodhams**: Assuming that that can carry the load.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Nbigler**: What's the.
**Awoodhams**: What's the elevation of that 54?
**Awoodhams**: Because obviously the stair rises.
**Awoodhams**: Right.
**Awoodhams**: So I mean, that.
**Awoodhams**: That should be all the way up to the bottom of the deck, correct?
**Bclymer**: Correct.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: 54 is just part of the mezzanine framing for the framed opening of the stair.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah, I think, I think that.
**Awoodhams**: I think we carry it that way, it's one less footer, you know, so.
**Awoodhams**: And.
**Awoodhams**: And the, the weight, which shouldn't be that much, I mean, at this.
**Awoodhams**: That thing's going to have feet on it sitting on the pad anyway.
**Bclymer**: So, Nick, if.
**Bclymer**: If that doesn't add a column at the 54 and 11 intersection, I think that's the direction that we'd prefer to go to get rid of the stair that's at the very bottom of the.
**Brhoades**: Landing or at the very shifting over.
**Brhoades**: Right.
**Brhoades**: Everything's over.
**Brhoades**: I already told them that so we want to try to eliminate that D3 and the Beam 53.
**Bclymer**: Correct.
**Bclymer**: The only reason that maybe we would keep that is if it adds an if at that T intersection.
**Bclymer**: If they can't do that just with a welded connection or like a welded or bolted connection, if they have to drop a column there at that intersection, then it.
**Bclymer**: Then we're not, you know, then it.
**Bclymer**: I just leave it as is.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Because then we're not really sure saving anything.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Brhoades**: Yeah, yeah, let me.
**Brhoades**: Let me work on it and I'll keep you guys updated.
**Gdesmit**: Okay.
**Nbigler**: So we're still looking like this, Jeff.
**Gdesmit**: Correct.
**Nbigler**: All right, so this has ag peer implications.
**Nbigler**: So when can we get the.
**Nbigler**: When can we get this updated and sent over to them?
**Brhoades**: I mean, as soon as I hear from Barco Pruden about, you know, is there something else we need to, like, think of or are we good just to eliminate it?
**Brhoades**: It seems pretty simple, and I'll let you know.
**Brhoades**: Like, when are they going to actually be in that area, do you think?
**Brhoades**: On site is.
**Nbigler**: Again, it's not about the area that they get to.
**Nbigler**: To mobilize out here.
**Nbigler**: They have to have.
**Nbigler**: They need their submittal back to get everything laid out and all their.
**Nbigler**: All their computers and stuff set.
**Brhoades**: I mean, like, so again, cloud it and say, hey, this one, I don't know.
**Nbigler**: Well, it's not just that.
**Nbigler**: There's several changes.
**Nbigler**: Now I got to give them.
**Nbigler**: We got, you know, we have these two here at the.
**Nbigler**: At the stairs.
**Nbigler**: We got to give them that one.
**Nbigler**: We got the ones here at the column or at the L stairs.
**Nbigler**: Now just do this.
**Awoodhams**: Look, mark them up what needs to move.
**Awoodhams**: Okay?
**Awoodhams**: Make sure it's clearly understood and there's a narrative.
**Awoodhams**: Send it to nick.
**Awoodhams**: You know, 30 minutes after this meeting, Nick's going to send it to Varco and he's going to say, hey, since you guys were late on your first deliverable, I need you to pop this up to the front of the list real quick and get it done.
**Gdesmit**: Yep.
**Awoodhams**: Will do.
**Bclymer**: And then Jerrica and Joe, we'll.
**Bclymer**: We'll try to meet directly after this as well, or sometimes today still to work through the rest of the stair ones and get those orientated in the right spot, and then we can send that back to you as well.
**Bclymer**: Glenn.
**Nbigler**: Are you talking about this here?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, just all of the landing ones just to make sure that we have.
**Gdesmit**: All of them covered.
**Gdesmit**: Okay?
**Nbigler**: Yeah, yeah.
**Nbigler**: If you guys are able to fix that so that Varco Gruden can.
**Nbigler**: Can get it, they can Give the locations.
**Nbigler**: Yeah, let's, let's get that done today and I'll let CNC know that those couple changes are coming.
**Brhoades**: What if it adds a column though, at line L?
**Bclymer**: Then I wouldn't change it.
**Bclymer**: I just leave it as is and would have shifted all over 1 foot 2.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah, that was the, that's the thing.
**Awoodhams**: It's only a quick.
**Awoodhams**: If we can do this and not add a column or just deleting it, then great.
**Awoodhams**: If we have to add something, then it's not going to be worth it.
**Bclymer**: Got it.
**Brhoades**: Okay.
**Nbigler**: To Nick, when you, you, you'll have them updated plans, they're gonna, they've, they've already started making these updates, shifting these stairs.
**Nbigler**: You'll have it, you'll have all the changes, not just what we're talking about now, where these were these changes that they're already going and making in the stamp set.
**Brhoades**: Correct?
**Awoodhams**: Yep.
**Nbigler**: The narrative you sent me, the other good architectural design, Jeff, I was going to hand it off to you if you want to share the screen and provide any design updates.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I guess on, on our side.
**Bclymer**: So, Brandon, we just need to get a meeting with the full ownership group sometime next week so we can go through the rest of the interior stuff.
**Bclymer**: If you want me to just go ahead and send over the updated packet ahead of time, we could probably send that over this afternoon to you guys and then you can at least forward it to them in the meantime while we're getting a meeting.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah, go ahead.
**Awoodhams**: Go ahead and send it to me.
**Awoodhams**: I, I was with Mike and Phil Monday and Tuesday.
**Awoodhams**: We have a couple projects down in Florida and Georgia and everything that we all had to go through and whatnot.
**Awoodhams**: And then they're flying back this morning, so they couldn't meet before this meeting.
**Awoodhams**: But go ahead and send me that stuff and I will, I will carve out some, you know, I'll carve out some time on their calendar and then that way we can go through it and get everything figured out.
**Gdesmit**: Okay, perfect.
**Bclymer**: And then aside from that, so I think from wrapping up the rest of our kind of section detail items, really we're just waiting on the finalized IFC model.
**Bclymer**: Obviously there's a few updates that are happening that are happening on VP's end and then really just need to get the balance of the trusses, the actual depths to figure out if we have to shift window and overhead door openings.
**Bclymer**: Obviously we want to get that in.
**Bclymer**: So you guys have, have that updated based on the final depth of those trusses.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah, let's let's definitely confirm that because I know that whenever we talked initially, whatever that was in that three, four weeks ago, I thought we did the math so that we had the clearance for our openings.
**Awoodhams**: Because we have so much clearance on the second floor, we were essentially moving the entire second floor up 6 inches or whatever so that we had that clearance.
**Awoodhams**: And so, you know, we really need to figure that out ASAP, Nick, because if we're 2 inches short or something like that, then, you know, we need to like look at that and be like, all right guys, like, how do A, how do we fuck this up?
**Awoodhams**: And B, how do we fix it?
**Awoodhams**: Because having that, that clear, like having having 15, 16 foot of clear on top and 10 or 9 foot of clear on the bottom is not good.
**Awoodhams**: We want it to be, you know, don't want to feel claustrophobic on the bottom.
**Awoodhams**: We want to have that space.
**Awoodhams**: And having those full doors, like what we, what we thought we masked out is critical to that.
**Awoodhams**: So.
**Brhoades**: Yeah, go ahead.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Brhoades**: In that meeting we were at like 9 foot 6 or 9 foot 8 with our clearance, that was the issue.
**Brhoades**: So then in that meeting we raised everything to 10 foot.
**Brhoades**: So above finished floor to the second level, any piece of steel is going to be over 10 foot.
**Brhoades**: So we know that for sure if.
**Awoodhams**: It'S going to be if.
**Awoodhams**: So those joists are included in that, right?
**Brhoades**: Yeah, yeah.
**Brhoades**: So then Jeff says on our shop drawings, it says on our shop drawings where the top of our joist is and the clearance, it's ten foot.
**Awoodhams**: So then Jeff, do we have an issue at the bottom of Joist Is 10 foot clear?
**Bclymer**: Yes, because the, if the doors themselves are at ten foot, the track and that goes above will be above that.
**Bclymer**: When we were.
**Bclymer**: My recollection before was when we were working with it, we needed a couple inches of clearance above the 10 foot line for the actual door track.
**Bclymer**: But it was like the worst case scenario of the, of the worst case scenario of the, of the joist, you know, which is the longer span, which is farther back.
**Bclymer**: The areas where we have the doors, it's a much shorter span.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: So if we can get, you know.
**Awoodhams**: So if we shorter, we need what, 10, 10, 3, 10, 4.
**Awoodhams**: What do we actually need to keep a 10 foot opening door?
**Bclymer**: We would need to see the actual spec and shop drawing for the individual overhead door that, that you guys priced out.
**Bclymer**: It should have an exact dimension for that.
**Awoodhams**: Glenn, do we, do we, can we get that?
**Awoodhams**: Do we have that?
**Nbigler**: I don't think I have the shop drawings from him yet, but I can get it.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah, they should have a generic.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah, exactly.
**Awoodhams**: It doesn't have to be a custom shop.
**Awoodhams**: They're gonna say, like, again, like what Jeff said, they'll have a.
**Awoodhams**: Here you go.
**Awoodhams**: Here's our cut sheet.
**Awoodhams**: You know, that's going to say the installation, blah, blah.
**Awoodhams**: And it could be a simple phone call over to.
**Awoodhams**: What's the space?
**Nbigler**: Dave.
**Awoodhams**: And so, yeah, Dave.
**Awoodhams**: Dave Biddle, Bill.
**Awoodhams**: So, yeah, he'll know.
**Awoodhams**: I mean, he's like, literally, he's always open indoors.
**Awoodhams**: So the.
**Brhoades**: Yeah.
**Awoodhams**: Figure that out so that we know for sure.
**Awoodhams**: And then that way we can say, all right, we got to have, you know, whatever that is, ten foot four.
**Awoodhams**: And then, Nick, we can go back and say, hey, guys, these joists.
**Awoodhams**: Because right now you have a generic 16 inch for all joists, which we know is not going to be the case.
**Awoodhams**: That's worst case.
**Awoodhams**: But we can go and say, hey, like, are these 16 inches?
**Awoodhams**: Are these 14 or 12?
**Awoodhams**: And if they're 16, then it's like, all right, you know, we could say, you can.
**Awoodhams**: Then I'll make a decision on which way we're going to go.
**Awoodhams**: But I need to know that information.
**Gdesmit**: Yep.
**Awoodhams**: You have somebody writing this down.
**Awoodhams**: I know it's almost lunchtime for you.
**Brhoades**: Yes.
**Brhoades**: I've already asked.
**Awoodhams**: What'd they say?
**Awoodhams**: We don't.
**Awoodhams**: We don't know.
**Brhoades**: Said that New Millennium, like, we gave them parameters.
**Brhoades**: New Millennium is the joy supplier.
**Brhoades**: So they're going with that and they're sizing everything.
**Brhoades**: So we've given them all of our depth and clearance requirements.
**Awoodhams**: And so Pneumonium doesn't know what size those specific joists will be yet, I take it.
**Brhoades**: Correct.
**Awoodhams**: Okay, well, let's get our clearance ASAP going, because that's going to tell us everything.
**Awoodhams**: Because then, you know, we can go back and say, hey, these.
**Awoodhams**: These section of joists, we need to make whatever that is 14 inches.
**Awoodhams**: And Millennium will be like, okay, no big deal.
**Awoodhams**: Or they'll be like, are you crazy?
**Awoodhams**: That's a $16 million ad.
**Awoodhams**: And then we'll just figure it out.
**Brhoades**: Right, because everyone wants our joist spacing.
**Brhoades**: We need to run eight new framed openings through our bar joists, which right now they fit.
**Brhoades**: But if you start to change that depth requirement, then it changes.
**Brhoades**: Like the joist spacing.
**Brhoades**: Right, Right.
**Awoodhams**: So, yeah, then it could be closer.
**Awoodhams**: Add more joy.
**Awoodhams**: I'm picking up what you're putting down, but, yeah, you.
**Awoodhams**: You need the.
**Awoodhams**: The total.
**Awoodhams**: Hey, you know, from, you know, bottom of joys.
**Awoodhams**: To four in these areas.
**Awoodhams**: So go ahead and put that on your, your list of priorities.
**Awoodhams**: As soon as we're off this call.
**Brhoades**: Is it hard to run their track over our joist cord?
**Awoodhams**: Well, you know what I mean, it's not that.
**Awoodhams**: It's the fact that like, even if we, like, no matter what that door would then hit, like, it doesn't.
**Awoodhams**: It has to like, basically act like it's a solid track essentially.
**Awoodhams**: Because when that thing comes up, like, you can't run, you can't run a track in like, you know, the voids of it, if that's what you're talking about.
**Bclymer**: Got it.
**Awoodhams**: I.
**Awoodhams**: I don't think at least, I mean, I guess maybe with the wheels and everything, but you're.
**Awoodhams**: You're picking up an inch maybe.
**Gdesmit**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Nbigler**: Speaking of that, we had, for the joist height, we had had this mechanical supply.
**Nbigler**: Air was coming, it was coming to the right and it was crossing under the hallway.
**Nbigler**: And I move it over here to the left to free that up.
**Nbigler**: But up here on the north side by kitchen one and two, we're still having.
**Nbigler**: This is a 12 inch supplies of 14 inch.
**Nbigler**: It's 26 inches there tucked up in the ceiling.
**Nbigler**: 20 by 12 here as well.
**Nbigler**: So we're not.
**Nbigler**: And even if this was to go between, you know, we can fit it between the joists because they run north, south, these ones not.
**Nbigler**: Not really going to be able to fit between the joists.
**Awoodhams**: What's the height of the ceiling there?
**Nbigler**: 10Ft.
**Awoodhams**: Okay, well, that's a drop ceiling, right?
**Bclymer**: It's nine.
**Bclymer**: In those back houses it's nine.
**Awoodhams**: But either way that's a drop ceiling, right?
**Bclymer**: Correct.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah.
**Awoodhams**: So I mean, in its back of house, we can make it eight.
**Gdesmit**: Okay.
**Awoodhams**: I mean, like, I'm not, I'm not as concerned about, I mean, moving and changing steel at this point for a back of house clearance.
**Gdesmit**: It.
**Awoodhams**: That doesn't make sense.
**Awoodhams**: Like we can literally lower the ceiling, save money on finishing drywall and paint, and nobody's gonna care because nobody's back there working or nobody's back there seeing anything.
**Awoodhams**: It's just working.
**Gdesmit**: All right, cool.
**Awoodhams**: So if you've got, if you've got 10 foot clear to the bottom of joist and you got 20 inches, then you put 8 foot ceiling right there.
**Awoodhams**: You should be solid.
**Gdesmit**: Good.
**Awoodhams**: The biggest thing is your 90s, which.
**Awoodhams**: I don't know, Jesse, if you looked.
**Nbigler**: At that with Glenn, which 90s.
**Nbigler**: Well, whenever you.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah, if you come in and you're 90 and over, which I.
**Awoodhams**: I'd have to review it to make sure there's no issues that didn't look like there are.
**Awoodhams**: But that's just something to go.
**Nbigler**: Hey, is this.
**Tom**: Is this the updated mechanical plan?
**Nbigler**: Yeah.
**Nbigler**: Yes, this is a permanent set of mechanical plan.
**Tom**: No, go to the first floor.
**Tom**: That's what I'm saying is, like, you got all these ducks crisscrossing where the bar joist they're running perpendicular to so that, like, there's just not.
**Tom**: I don't believe there's enough room there to.
**Tom**: To fit all that in there.
**Cordellm**: The Just jumping in here.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Cordellm**: Jesse, the kitchen ventilation routing is a little bit out of date here.
**Cordellm**: From what I sent over, nothing that really affects us too much.
**Cordellm**: Just wanted to get that in there.
**Awoodhams**: Well, it's important.
**Awoodhams**: So do you have the.
**Awoodhams**: The updated kitchen plan that he's talking about, Glenn?
**Nbigler**: Yeah, this is.
**Nbigler**: Who was that speaking?
**Cordellm**: Both headers captivair.
**Nbigler**: Oh, yeah, this.
**Nbigler**: Yeah, this is the mechanical plan.
**Nbigler**: Let me go back and see what I have for drawing of a kitchen set.
**Gdesmit**: Here.
**Nbigler**: Yeah, this is the most recent kitchen set that I have from you, Bo.
**Awoodhams**: Is this the right one?
**Nbigler**: Well, so there.
**Cordellm**: There's that.
**Cordellm**: That FG Shaffer plan I overlaid my duct emailed that week or so ago, and just trying to hit those supply closets.
**Cordellm**: The.
**Cordellm**: On the Y axis, essentially, the ducts coming up at a slightly different from what's being shown on that one drawing that was up there.
**Awoodhams**: So you're saying that when you overlaid it, the mechanical drawing is coming up differently than what is.
**Awoodhams**: Like, it's not hitting the closets, you're saying.
**Cordellm**: Correct.
**Awoodhams**: Go back to your mechanical drawing.
**Awoodhams**: So, Glenn, what you need to do is look at those column lines, and you need to go pull measurements for each one of those and check it to make sure it comes up through.
**Awoodhams**: Like, basically, you know, pull it off column lines, make sure that's accurate.
**Awoodhams**: And then, you know, get with mica and have them adjust it if need be, because.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah, we want to make sure that's correct, because that way our mechanical sub can.
**Awoodhams**: Can actually get this stuff prefabbed and it's Right.
**Awoodhams**: So they're not banging sheet metal in the field and being pissed off, are you.
**Nbigler**: You're talking about these exhaust fans and the.
**Nbigler**: And the makeup air ducts?
**Nbigler**: Bo Or Yes.
**Cordellm**: Could you send me this.
**Cordellm**: This drawing that you have pulled up right now just after the meeting?
**Nbigler**: Sure, yeah.
**Nbigler**: Well, yeah, this is all your hood.
**Nbigler**: This is a full mechanical set with all your hood drawings in it.
**Nbigler**: So this is the permit set.
**Nbigler**: And Started off with your hood drawings.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah, we'll send it to you Bo and then.
**Cordellm**: Okay.
**Awoodhams**: Make sure that he's got access to job planner too.
**Awoodhams**: That way he, you know, can.
**Awoodhams**: Because that's always going to have the latest and greatest drawings on there.
**Nbigler**: Last thing for today was just the gas and electric loads.
**Nbigler**: I guess just the electric.
**Nbigler**: The invoice to Duke was paid for the new service and transformer.
**Nbigler**: Other than that, Alex or Brennan, if you guys are on here.
**Nbigler**: Is there.
**Nbigler**: Is this a long lead item?
**Nbigler**: Can we go ahead and get this ordered?
**Tom**: Is the utility transformer long in the.
**Nbigler**: Lead item you're asking?
**Nbigler**: Yeah, no, the.
**Gdesmit**: They're.
**Tom**: We're all set with them.
**Gdesmit**: Okay.
**Nbigler**: This is complete design deliverables right now.
**Nbigler**: Everything for the most part has been turned in.
**Nbigler**: We still have the fire suppression and the fire alarm drawings to.
**Nbigler**: To come.
**Nbigler**: And then of course we gotta make these final corrections on the steel building and foundation set.
**Nbigler**: Other than that, I believe Jeff, you said that's the last thing you're waiting on.
**Nbigler**: We got JQOL and lemaster signed or if our COBRA signed off on the.
**Nbigler**: The contract that you cdr.
**Nbigler**: Yeah, yeah, yeah, sorry.
**Nbigler**: The CDR that you guys were discussing.
**Nbigler**: So if that's signed off on, we're just what, Jeff?
**Nbigler**: Waiting on them to finalize these.
**Nbigler**: These plans because.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I think from.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I don't think from a state standpoint, we won't.
**Bclymer**: Unless it has to do specifically with like a life safety thing.
**Bclymer**: We won't re upload because it's not changing square footage or anything.
**Bclymer**: We won't re upload as an addendum to the state.
**Bclymer**: We just need to keep as you know, as constructed drawings kind of on site from an inspection standpoint.
**Bclymer**: I think the only other thing.
**Bclymer**: I haven't seen a reply email back from the state yet, but it'll probably get looked at today or tomorrow.
**Bclymer**: So as long as that extra fee has been paid, it should be going into review.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Nbigler**: You'Re saying you have already included the structural steel and the foundation drawings in your cdr?
**Bclymer**: Everything is up on this.
**Bclymer**: Everything is on the state with the exception of the two things you just mentioned.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: So fire protection and any of the revised electrical ones.
**Bclymer**: But as far as getting through a review for the state, the full state permit.
**Bclymer**: Right, Aside from the foundation permit, which you guys already have.
**Bclymer**: As long as that extra fee has been paid, it should go directly into review.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Brhoades**: And has anyone been able to confirm yet on the fire suppression that our five pound collateral load.
**Brhoades**: Everything.
**Brhoades**: We're good There.
**Brhoades**: They're not putting huge pipes up there.
**Nbigler**: Chris Lopez.
**Jfield**: No, the largest pipe we're running is a 3 inch feed main, and then everything else is inch and a half.
**Bclymer**: Perfect.
**Brhoades**: Thank you.
**Gdesmit**: Yep.
**Nbigler**: How you doing, Chris?
**Nbigler**: Good to see you today.
**Jfield**: Fantastic.
**Nbigler**: You got something for me today?
**Jfield**: I sure hope so.
**Jfield**: Like I said, they.
**Jfield**: They were getting that all this tariff language in these come.
**Jfield**: That's the most difficult legal team you could ever imagine so.
**Jfield**: But I'm trying, man.
**Jfield**: I really am.
**Nbigler**: So we're expecting a big red line markup contractor?
**Jfield**: No, they just added a.
**Jfield**: It's just a paragraph with Siemens.
**Awoodhams**: We have a master contract with you guys that we negotiated two years ago.
**Awoodhams**: Why are we changing this, Chris?
**Jfield**: I don't.
**Jfield**: This is.
**Jfield**: This is tariff language.
**Jfield**: This is an addendum with the whole tariff stuff.
**Awoodhams**: That's force majeure.
**Awoodhams**: But fine, send it over.
**Jfield**: Yeah, I mean, it's.
**Jfield**: It ain't me, so.
**Awoodhams**: I know.
**Awoodhams**: It's.
**Awoodhams**: I get it.
**Awoodhams**: I'm fighting this all the damn time.
**Jfield**: Oh, yeah.
**Jfield**: I'll make sure he gets over.
**Gdesmit**: Okay.
**Nbigler**: When.
**Awoodhams**: When.
**Nbigler**: When are we gonna start working on your perma set for draw?
**Jfield**: Oh, I'm pretty much ready to submit.
**Jfield**: I've got a.
**Jfield**: I've got a drawing set I can submit.
**Jfield**: I don't have fabrication drawings done yet just because I know there's.
**Jfield**: Sounds like, you know, there's some structural changes.
**Jfield**: Make sure we.
**Jfield**: We hit the mark on those.
**Jfield**: So.
**Jfield**: Okay, so I can.
**Jfield**: Yeah, once we, you know, I.
**Jfield**: I can probably.
**Jfield**: I can upload them whenever.
**Jfield**: I'll send over the.
**Jfield**: Our little CDR to get signed from you guys.
**Bclymer**: If you want instead.
**Bclymer**: Glenn, I don't.
**Bclymer**: You should have one.
**Bclymer**: But if.
**Bclymer**: If not, we.
**Bclymer**: I can forward you a pre signed one that you can just fill out your portion of on the fire suppression side if that makes it easier for you guys.
**Nbigler**: A pre.
**Nbigler**: A pre filled out cdr.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, that like it already has all the owner information and everything else done.
**Bclymer**: So all fire suppression has to do is fill out their design professional portion and it's done.
**Jfield**: That'd be great.
**Gdesmit**: Okay.
**Nbigler**: And then fire alarm.
**Nbigler**: Dean, are you guys doing the fire alarm design on this too, or did we.
**Nbigler**: Yeah, going through.
**Nbigler**: Yes.
**Nbigler**: Yeah.
**Nbigler**: When.
**Nbigler**: When is that.
**Nbigler**: When is that coming?
**Tom**: I believe we have the set for permit.
**Tom**: I need to check with Brennan.
**Tom**: He was subbing that, so I'll follow up with him on that.
**Nbigler**: All right, let's check in and get some deliverable dates on that.
**Nbigler**: All right, guys, Anything else for today?
**Gdesmit**: All right, cool.
**Nbigler**: We'll look.
**Nbigler**: Look to see the updated stuff from UNIC today on the building.
**Nbigler**: And, Jeff, you're going to send over an email with the markups that we talked about.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Nbigler**: And, Bo, I will mail you, email you the mechanical plans right now.
**Nbigler**: Sounds good.
**Awoodhams**: Thank you.
**Nbigler**: Cool.
**Nbigler**: All right, guys.
**Nbigler**: Thank you.
