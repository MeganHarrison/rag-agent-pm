## Transcript
**Bclymer**: Morning, Daniel.
**Bclymer**: There's not a lot on here.
**Jdawson**: Sa.
**Bclymer**: Morning, Alex.
**Nbigler**: Hey, how's it going?
**Jdawson**: Good.
**Bclymer**: So we just need Jeff and.
**Jdawson**: Here.
**Bclymer**: I guess we can get started.
**Bclymer**: I know.
**Bclymer**: Nick, you said you gotta cut out here soon.
**Bclymer**: The Micah just had comments on here by the gas loads now that you have the kitchen equipment.
**Awoodhams**: Yep, all the gas loads are finalized.
**Awoodhams**: I got a calculation on the drawings and everything.
**Awoodhams**: I don't know who.
**Awoodhams**: If does someone need that to file with citizens or anything right now or.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, they gotta either increase the size or run a new line or something to us.
**Bclymer**: So we got to get that to them and then they can finalize whatever cost that's going to be and get that into their engineering.
**Awoodhams**: Do you want.
**Bclymer**: Well, I mean I'd send it to Glenn and you know, copy me and then Glenn should be submitting that.
**Bclymer**: I believe you get that submitted.
**Bclymer**: Is that typically something the engineer needs to send to them?
**Awoodhams**: It doesn't really.
**Awoodhams**: I don't think it really matters who does it as long as the calculations are on there.
**Awoodhams**: But if there's a spot that we need to sign or do, we can.
**Awoodhams**: Okay, but I will.
**Awoodhams**: I'll pull out the little table.
**Awoodhams**: Just make a little screenshot of the table that I have for the gas loads and send that to you guys for now and I'll list what size I calculated the main to be.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right, very good.
**Bclymer**: Structure foundation just got the aggregate peers starting on the 21st.
**Bclymer**: I think they're going.
**Bclymer**: They're doing their pre construction meeting so we can get started declaring and grubbing on Monday because the plan we don't have anyone here from.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Jeff's not on one thing.
**Bclymer**: You know, last week I guess or this week in the oac they were asking about splitting the spaces up so there'd be like two owners, one for the volleyball, one for the restaurant side.
**Bclymer**: And Micah, do you see any issue like to do that we may have to make it like a one or two hour demising wall between the volleyball court.
**Awoodhams**: That was the only thing I came up with that I thought about when you guys and Jeff would have to be the one to definitely do that.
**Awoodhams**: But yeah, if you're going to separate it and say it's two buildings or two spaces, I would think you almost need a two hour fire separation or something.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Awoodhams**: But on my side the gas would be.
**Awoodhams**: No, no major thing.
**Awoodhams**: Just set a second meter and pull off the two sides.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And I think they wanted to first get the design cost to redesign that first.
**Bclymer**: Nick.
**Bclymer**: They wanted us to Split up your building?
**Bclymer**: Like no, we're not doing that.
**Gdesmit**: Gosh, I told them to do that so long ago.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: They were gonna like move them like 10 foot apart or something, put some space in between them and whatnot.
**Bclymer**: We're like, we're way too far down the road at this point to do that.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Wow.
**Bclymer**: So, yeah.
**Bclymer**: So if we split those, you know, the only thing I'm thinking we were going to run those exhaust ducts with the grease hood duct out through that wall.
**Bclymer**: And I don't know if that just, if we can do that still.
**Bclymer**: But we would need to just add.
**Awoodhams**: Just have that dampers.
**Awoodhams**: We just have to put a damper in it.
**Bclymer**: Well, they, I didn't think they allowed dampers in grease duct.
**Awoodhams**: I don't know.
**Awoodhams**: Let's have a captive and see.
**Bclymer**: I mean like running through hospitals.
**Bclymer**: But it was all welded steel duct.
**Bclymer**: So you know, it, it had a two hour rating on its own to pass through floors and everything else to get out the building.
**Bclymer**: But that's what I'm just thinking.
**Bclymer**: We need to look at that.
**Bclymer**: If we need to keep everything on the restaurant side, you would just be running another duct up through them chases, you know where we're putting the makeup error.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah.
**Awoodhams**: So I have.
**Awoodhams**: So since we're kind of on that subject, I have everything about drawn and shown.
**Awoodhams**: So I think this is going to be a coordination.
**Awoodhams**: Once I send this off to you guys by the end of the day, you guys can look at it over the next week.
**Awoodhams**: And we.
**Awoodhams**: Because right now the makeup errors are going through those closets, but the exhaust ducts are going kind of right on the outside of them or near another wall.
**Awoodhams**: So maybe we just have to add another box, you know, boxed out, you know, to hide it.
**Awoodhams**: But I want, once I get it all drawn here, you guys can look at it over the next week and we can coordinate.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Awoodhams**: Exactly how.
**Awoodhams**: Because I mean I've done the.
**Awoodhams**: I think I got everything in separations, this and that.
**Awoodhams**: But if we have to keep it on the same side of that wall, we'll have to tweak a few things.
**Bclymer**: But sure.
**Gdesmit**: I mean, I would say that.
**Awoodhams**: You.
**Gdesmit**: Know, it's, it's so early on, like anything can.
**Gdesmit**: I would say that we are going to be as flexible as we can.
**Gdesmit**: And once we get that mezzanine layout, we'll just have to start making some decisions.
**Gdesmit**: Right.
**Gdesmit**: We're going to go up the columns.
**Gdesmit**: Is that stupid?
**Gdesmit**: How big are the columns?
**Gdesmit**: Well, we should know what the web of the columns Are tomorrow.
**Gdesmit**: Right.
**Gdesmit**: So then we can start saying, hey, it makes sense to run stuff up this side of the web and then maybe the other side.
**Gdesmit**: Right.
**Gdesmit**: I.
**Gdesmit**: I don't know.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah, I agree.
**Awoodhams**: I think we kind of get it all put together and then we look at it all as one big package at some point and see what we can.
**Jdawson**: And.
**Bclymer**: And did we have like a.
**Bclymer**: What the design of the bar.
**Bclymer**: The bar joist, the floor bar joists are going to look like as far as layout and direction.
**Gdesmit**: Right.
**Gdesmit**: I mean, we should be getting that.
**Bclymer**: Very soon because it may be.
**Bclymer**: You have to go straight up anyways.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah.
**Awoodhams**: There could be things like that that change it.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah.
**Awoodhams**: But like I said, we'll have a good step by the end of the day and we can work on coordination after that.
**Gdesmit**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Okay, then, Alex, I think you've already got notification to look at having two meters splitting up the power service.
**Bclymer**: You know what that would entail.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Awoodhams**: And Alex, I will send you today too, the updated mechanical showing the fans and the makeup errors and all that.
**Nbigler**: Okay, good deal.
**Bclymer**: And then does the.
**Bclymer**: So they need two water meters as well.
**Bclymer**: Two gas meters, two water meters.
**Awoodhams**: Anything about the water?
**Awoodhams**: I mean, the only thing on the volleyball side is some hose bibs.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And that could just.
**Awoodhams**: I would say you leave the water as one.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Awoodhams**: Because that's going to be like two tap fees.
**Awoodhams**: Two.
**Awoodhams**: I mean, it's.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah, maybe.
**Awoodhams**: I don't know.
**Awoodhams**: I would leave the water as one.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: If it's just hose bibs, it's just.
**Awoodhams**: Hose dips on the volleyball side.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And then we don't have.
**Bclymer**: There's no one off from Fritz.
**Bclymer**: So is the.
**Bclymer**: I don't even see Jeff on the invite Here.
**Gdesmit**: Here.
**Bclymer**: I guess he just didn't respond.
**Bclymer**: But the grease interceptor sizing.
**Bclymer**: I don't know if that's been discussed.
**Awoodhams**: I did that this morning and I think the thousand gallons is efficient.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Awoodhams**: Kind of backed into the way citizens wants it done with the meals per day and doing them all kind of as individual single serve kitchens, because that's kind of what they are.
**Awoodhams**: They're all being combined together, but they're all individual.
**Awoodhams**: So I think the thousand gallon is sufficient.
**Bclymer**: Okay, that's good.
**Bclymer**: See here.
**Bclymer**: Is there anything on these openings, Nick?
**Bclymer**: The two need confirmed with the curbs that get you all the info on the roof curbs for the kitchen equipment?
**Gdesmit**: Yeah, I've got everything that I need.
**Gdesmit**: I'm waiting until Varco gets all of our stuff to start laying them out and to see where our Purlins are roof ramming members just to make sure that, you know, can we move things over a few inches here or there, make sure we get the orientation.
**Gdesmit**: You know, if it's a square, it's easy.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Gdesmit**: But if it's not, then we just.
**Gdesmit**: We have to locate curves within a certain part of the roof panels.
**Gdesmit**: So once we get all that information, then we'll be able to say, hey, mechanical guy, are you okay?
**Gdesmit**: If we like, plop these openings here and we can start working on that.
**Awoodhams**: You want me to share with you, Nick, the where I've kind of located this stuff and then we can again go from there over the next week.
**Awoodhams**: You guys can discuss it and.
**Gdesmit**: Absolutely.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Gdesmit**: Yep, yep.
**Awoodhams**: I just got all those kind of located this morning.
**Gdesmit**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Deal.
**Bclymer**: There was a note on here to send the gas load to Ashton.
**Awoodhams**: I could put them on the email too.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And then you'll send him also that grease trap or.
**Bclymer**: That'd be part of it.
**Bclymer**: Then he can draw that?
**Awoodhams**: Yeah, I can.
**Awoodhams**: I can share the calculation for the grease trap too.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Alex, on the Duke, is there anything left to coordinate on that?
**Bclymer**: Are they good to go with our power needs?
**Nbigler**: I think they're good to go.
**Nbigler**: I will probably need to reach back out to them about the dual metering piece of it.
**Bclymer**: Okay, well, that are you able to do they allow like a sub meter?
**Bclymer**: Like if we still keep with the main service we got coming in, would that account for it if they meter just whatever panels fed off of it to feed the volleyball area?
**Nbigler**: I don't believe so.
**Awoodhams**: They.
**Nbigler**: They want it to be.
**Nbigler**: The meter is completely in their control and on the line side of all the gear and everything.
**Bclymer**: So is the transformer size big enough?
**Bclymer**: You just run a new.
**Bclymer**: Another set of secondaries and then.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: All right, let's see all these dates where we're trying to get submittal MEPs 44 architectural.
**Bclymer**: Not on, but 4 7, Dean, Alex, by 4 11.
**Bclymer**: And this doesn't include if they decided to split the spaces up.
**Bclymer**: We understand that, but we'll have to do that as you know, just a revision to what we got.
**Bclymer**: You're good on 4 11, Alex.
**Nbigler**: Yeah, we're still tracking for that.
**Bclymer**: And Mike, when you say these your drawings, this is the ones you're talking about.
**Bclymer**: They're ready.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah, I'm gonna send them.
**Awoodhams**: I'll send them.
**Awoodhams**: I mean, I figured Jeff was going to file mine along with his on Monday is kind of what we talked at once.
**Awoodhams**: So I will send it.
**Awoodhams**: I will custom it kind of the whole group of people, you and Glenn and Jeff and that the sign and sealed set and everything today before I leave.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And then Nick, they had structural like are those drawings?
**Jdawson**: Is that still.
**Gdesmit**: Tomorrow you'll get wall frame.
**Gdesmit**: We'll know what, where the girts are, the wall framing, roof framing, where the columns are, how big the columns are, and then floor construction reactions will be.
**Gdesmit**: So I'll forward all that stuff to the design team.
**Gdesmit**: That's the plan.
**Bclymer**: And just a comment I know Glenn was asking, but typically in this jurisdiction, does the city.
**Bclymer**: Will they do their own inspections for the structure or do they require any kind of threshold inspection to happen?
**Gdesmit**: No, I mean, I would say.
**Gdesmit**: And I told GLENN this yesterday, nine times out of 10, I don't.
**Gdesmit**: I'm not even aware of any type of review.
**Gdesmit**: Sometimes like in big like freezer warehouse buildings, there will be tests done by a third party.
**Gdesmit**: We don't include that.
**Gdesmit**: You know, Varco Prudent doesn't include that.
**Gdesmit**: Like it's our job to get it right.
**Gdesmit**: And if a third party wants to come in and inspect bolts and audit it, you know, they'll pick a certain number, percentage of the volts.
**Gdesmit**: But there's no requirement that I'm aware of.
**Gdesmit**: I mean, this is a standard occupancy building now.
**Gdesmit**: It's.
**Gdesmit**: It's use is different than, you know, a normal building since there's like dining and gathering and a mezzanine.
**Gdesmit**: So that would be up to Jerrica and Jeff.
**Gdesmit**: I have no idea what they have specked.
**Gdesmit**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: But is it like nor has that.
**Gdesmit**: Come up normally to me when I've seen inspections happen, the general contractor is the person who decides that unless they're being told by the design team.
**Gdesmit**: And I don't know that.
**Gdesmit**: You know what I mean?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Usually it's been.
**Bclymer**: Owner wants to double check it, but I, you know, are they just.
**Bclymer**: It's welds and do you use like a snap bolt so you know that everything's torqued down correctly just by a visual or how does that.
**Gdesmit**: They're not bolts like that.
**Bclymer**: All right, well, we'll look into that, but I think we'll definitely handle that if it's needed.
**Gdesmit**: Right?
**Gdesmit**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: I think we got our stair sub lined up.
**Bclymer**: We're able to get the post got it in budget to put picket railings on the interior.
**Bclymer**: And then on the exterior, it's just going to be the post with the wood on each side of it.
**Bclymer**: So I think they.
**Bclymer**: And then also with those drawings coming out tomorrow, will Be the.
**Bclymer**: All the bent plant.
**Bclymer**: The bent angle on your edge.
**Bclymer**: A slab?
**Bclymer**: Yep, down there.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Gdesmit**: So do you have.
**Gdesmit**: Glenn said he was not sure if he was going to get an install number from that company.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, these guys will come in and install it, too.
**Gdesmit**: Okay, good.
**Gdesmit**: Nice.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Gdesmit**: Oh, they're gonna install the bent plate?
**Gdesmit**: Is that what you just said?
**Bclymer**: Not the bent plate.
**Gdesmit**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: System.
**Bclymer**: They'll attach it to your bent plate.
**Gdesmit**: Sounds good.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I think it's about it.
**Bclymer**: Do you guys have any questions or info you need from us?
**Gdesmit**: I'm good.
**Awoodhams**: I think I'm good now.
**Bclymer**: Well, I would go tomorrow.
**Bclymer**: Hopefully you guys can make it out there to the groundbreaking.
**Awoodhams**: North Carolina?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: We put up a tent.
**Gdesmit**: So rain or shine, I'll be on.
**Awoodhams**: My way to Carolina.
**Awoodhams**: So you guys enjoy yourselves.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Spring break.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah, we're gonna be in Hilton Head all next week.
**Bclymer**: Nice.
**Bclymer**: Gonna do fishing.
**Awoodhams**: I don't know.
**Awoodhams**: No one's really playing anything.
**Awoodhams**: My daughter's into all sorts of obscure things.
**Awoodhams**: Like we went to Lizzie Borden's house in Salem in Massachusetts.
**Awoodhams**: She wants to go to some haunted stuff in Savannah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Awoodhams**: But no, we're just gonna go hang out.
**Awoodhams**: I'm gonna disappear for a week, so don't cough.
**Bclymer**: Nice.
**Bclymer**: That's how I do my vacations.
**Bclymer**: I just go somewhere and I'll figure out what I do when I get there.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah, yeah, that's kind of what we do.
**Awoodhams**: Try to visit.
**Awoodhams**: I mean, we visited almost 30 states so far, so.
**Bclymer**: Nice.
**Awoodhams**: You guys enjoy the groundbreaking, and hopefully things will get moving with us.
**Awoodhams**: And I'll get this stuff over tonight.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: Appreciate it, Micah.
**Awoodhams**: Thanks, guys.
**Bclymer**: Thanks, Nick.
**Bclymer**: Thanks, Alex.
**Bclymer**: See you.
