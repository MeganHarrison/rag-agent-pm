## Transcript
**Sclevenger**: Driving today should be, should be a short one here.
**Sclevenger**: We'll give a couple minutes for Sean and get going.
**Cmortensen**: Morning Jesse.
**Sclevenger**: Morning Alex.
**Sclevenger**: Well Corey, I'll go ahead and get going here.
**Sclevenger**: I have Alex on here.
**Sclevenger**: He's going to be our superintendent.
**Sclevenger**: Oh, here's Sean.
**Sclevenger**: Look at that.
**Sclevenger**: Hey Sean.
**Bclymer**: I can tell you Glendon won't be on today.
**Bclymer**: No, you added him, right?
**Bclymer**: I think you did.
**Bclymer**: So he won't be here.
**Sclevenger**: Okay, I'll go ahead and share my screen here.
**Sclevenger**: This one's going to be pretty quick here.
**Sclevenger**: So adls amendment.
**Sclevenger**: I reached out to Christina with the city.
**Sclevenger**: She expects to have all of the review approvals by.
**Sclevenger**: She said give them this week and so I'm going to follow up with her again Monday and hopefully we'll be through everything we need as far as the amendment goes on Monday, Tuesday, next week and then from there I, I take that amendment letter and I upload it to the portal for the permit and that should push it through.
**Sclevenger**: I'm hoping by the end of next week.
**Sclevenger**: I received comments back on the sign and I, I copied you guys on it.
**Sclevenger**: I sent that to FedEx for them to change their design on their sign.
**Sclevenger**: That would be a long AAA way.
**Sclevenger**: So once they get those to me, I'll submit those for them and we should be good from a sign perspective.
**Sclevenger**: Corey, I know you and I texted back and forth earlier this week about the cost for the masonry build outs.
**Sclevenger**: They did end up being more than I expected.
**Sclevenger**: So it was pretty close to a wash, but ended up being seventeen hundred dollars more.
**Sclevenger**: Sean, is what I was talking with Corey about and okay, we know, we know it's tight and you know we want to be partners for this project and many more to come.
**Sclevenger**: So we're going to go ahead and cover that 1700 and then saves us some time and paperwork.
**Sclevenger**: And what I'll do is I, I have a bill for design.
**Sclevenger**: I'm going to send you guys here today and then what I do on it, even on a zero dollar change order is I'll show you where that money's moving.
**Sclevenger**: So you guys have an idea of, of costs associated but that will be a zero dollar change order and then yeah, we're just gearing up for 6:16 start.
**Ahuettl**: So what do you guys.
**Ahuettl**: We talked about this before AJ but what do you guys need for access?
**Ahuettl**: I think our store hours.
**Ahuettl**: Somebody's usually there from 6:30.
**Ahuettl**: But initially we'll have to be letting you guys in the building, correct?
**Cmortensen**: Yeah.
**Sclevenger**: So we got with Sean the, the site Manager Alex has met him.
**Sclevenger**: We've been texting back and forth with him.
**Sclevenger**: We've already have had electricians there kind of snooping around, gearing up, ready to go.
**Sclevenger**: They had a lift delivered and we're doing some, some reconnaissance.
**Sclevenger**: Not this week, but last week.
**Sclevenger**: And so I think we're good there.
**Sclevenger**: Alex has Sean's number.
**Cmortensen**: So once.
**Sclevenger**: It's really just that first week when we will have to go through that side door in order to get into the space.
**Sclevenger**: But once we cut those openings, Corey, you know, we'll.
**Sclevenger**: We'll have a door, a temporary door that we install that we lock.
**Sclevenger**: It's a construction door.
**Bclymer**: And Corey, Sean at the store said that they open at 6 and they're usually there by 5:30.
**Bclymer**: There's people there at 5:30, sometimes earlier.
**Ahuettl**: Okay, good deal.
**Sclevenger**: Yeah, it works out great.
**Sclevenger**: I think access is, is working out good.
**Sclevenger**: And so next week, Alex will be getting our porter potty delivered and our dumpster delivered.
**Sclevenger**: And so we'll start mobilizing a little early.
**Sclevenger**: And you know, I don't want to be cutting any holes in the.
**Sclevenger**: In the side of the building until I get that permit, but we can maybe start on some interior stuff.
**Cmortensen**: Basically.
**Jdawson**: The.
**Sclevenger**: The way to get a head start would be my electrician starting to run their conduit for that other service.
**Sclevenger**: That's about it, though.
**Ahuettl**: Sounds good.
**Cmortensen**: Alrighty.
**Sclevenger**: Talked about mobilization.
**Sclevenger**: So, Corey, you weren't on the call, but it was a good call on Tuesday with FedEx.
**Sclevenger**: We were able to figure out that scheduling question that we had with them there towards the end.
**Sclevenger**: So I'm going to update that this week and I'll shoot that out to everybody here.
**Sclevenger**: I'm hoping to get it done today.
**Sclevenger**: And.
**Cmortensen**: We.
**Sclevenger**: We are just going to loop.
**Sclevenger**: They were thinking they were gonna have to pull another permit, but they keep it kind of clean.
**Sclevenger**: I'd like to just loop their project in under ours.
**Sclevenger**: So we will do a final inspection when they get all of their finishes done.
**Sclevenger**: I'll order that Final inspection.
**Sclevenger**: They were okay with that.
**Sclevenger**: I think that that helps.
**Sclevenger**: That way we don't have two open permits under the same address.
**Sclevenger**: It can sometimes get complicated.
**Ahuettl**: Sure.
**Sclevenger**: Any questions for me?
**Ahuettl**: I don't have any.
**Bclymer**: Nope.
**Bclymer**: Sounds like we're gearing up.
**Bclymer**: It's going well.
**Sclevenger**: Yep.
**Sclevenger**: Ramping up.
**Sclevenger**: And I'll keep you guys updated on when I hear from the city.
**Bclymer**: Okay, Sounds great.
**Sclevenger**: Jesse, you have any questions?
**Sclevenger**: No, I'm good.
**Cmortensen**: Tweet.
**Sclevenger**: Short and sweet like these meetings.
**Cmortensen**: No.
**Sclevenger**: No issues here.
**Sclevenger**: So we'll reconvene here next week and we'll start knocking it out.
**Ahuettl**: Sounds good, A.J.
