## Transcript
**Bclymer**: All.
**Bclymer**: All the other ones I did do, which was nice, but.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, not Bogota.
**Bclymer**: But is it cold?
**Bclymer**: Is it cold at the moment or right now is.
**Luke**: Yeah, it's kind of cold.
**Luke**: I mean, it's.
**Luke**: Sometimes in the morning it's very warm and then in the afternoon it's rainy, so it's waring that type of the moment, but it's cold In.
**Luke**: In the nights are very cold.
**Luke**: Yeah.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, imagine.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: It was like Medellin was like the perfect temperature for everywhere.
**Luke**: Oh, yeah.
**Luke**: No, Medellin is beautiful.
**Luke**: Yeah.
**Luke**: And the temperature is amazing.
**Luke**: Yeah, I agree.
**Luke**: You have.
**Luke**: You visit Cartagena?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, no, no, I literally just.
**Luke**: You have to go.
**Luke**: That's the place to go.
**Bclymer**: Santa Mar, these other places.
**Bclymer**: Unfortunately, I'm stuck in a bit of a predicament at the moment because the Colombian government didn't.
**Bclymer**: The Colombian.
**Bclymer**: The US government didn't like me traveling back and forth too much, so.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Oh, wow.
**Luke**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So, yeah, kind of put a bit of a hold onto that.
**Luke**: Okay, sounds good.
**Luke**: Hi, Amin, how are you?
**Eileeniglesias2**: Hi, Maria.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Doing good.
**Eileeniglesias2**: How about you?
**Eileeniglesias2**: Okay, good.
**Luke**: Samantha is doing a little bit late.
**Luke**: Right.
**Luke**: And then Brandon, I don't know where he is.
**Luke**: He's usually very.
**Luke**: Let me just call him, tell him.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Hi, Sam.
**Bclymer**: Hi, Lainey.
**Bclymer**: How you doing?
**Eileeniglesias2**: Good.
**Bclymer**: It's been a minute.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Hasn't been too long.
**Eileeniglesias2**: It's been two.
**Eileeniglesias2**: A week, right?
**Eileeniglesias2**: A week, yeah.
**Eileeniglesias2**: It's crazy.
**Eileeniglesias2**: What?
**Luke**: Well, sorry to interrupt.
**Luke**: Brandon is on a plane, so that's good.
**Luke**: Well, he was the one who requested.
**Luke**: Jesus.
**Luke**: Okay, I'm gonna play.
**Eileeniglesias2**: He requested the meeting while he was.
**Luke**: I know.
**Bclymer**: That'S crazy.
**Luke**: He's typing.
**Luke**: So one second.
**Luke**: He might be like.
**Luke**: One second.
**Luke**: So.
**Luke**: But.
**Luke**: Yeah, but we can.
**Luke**: So for the aquarium.
**Luke**: I called them this morning, Roger and Jacqueline.
**Luke**: No response from them.
**Luke**: Voicemail again.
**Luke**: I called them before like my 2 o', clock, still nothing.
**Luke**: So I don't know if we shall actually show up there like it was suggested.
**Luke**: Didn't realize there was a call.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yes.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah, I.
**Eileeniglesias2**: We.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So me and Samantha toured the Red Door venue today.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I sent those videos in the chat for everyone to look at.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I really loved it.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Sam really loved it.
**Eileeniglesias2**: We thought it fit the vibe of what we're going for, which is like jazz speakeasy.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Like someone actually hosted a Great Gatsby themed party there.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So it's kind of like perfect in my opinion.
**Eileeniglesias2**: There's plenty of parking.
**Eileeniglesias2**: The only thing is that we could only do it up until 11 because the servers that would help us like set everything up and Also take everything down and like clean everything up at the end.
**Eileeniglesias2**: The owner of the event space doesn't want his people like having to stay until like 1 2am so he's got a set like it's up until 11am but the location is so close to Armature Works and there's plenty of places there to go get a drink afterwards if anyone wants to.
**Eileeniglesias2**: However, with it being an open bar, I feel like everyone's gonna be sloshed by 11 anyways and want to like just go home.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Luke**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Depending on what Brandon says, let's just run it if the aquarium is around.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah, like that.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Because those are only two like good venue options.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I also looked into the Grand Cathedral Cigar place.
**Eileeniglesias2**: That one is gorgeous.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I mean it is an absolutely beautiful, very antique vibes, like would fit the theme really well as, as well.
**Eileeniglesias2**: But.
**Eileeniglesias2**: But it's just extremely expensive.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So we would only have three locations.
**Eileeniglesias2**: It's obviously one big location outside, indoor, upstairs, downstairs.
**Eileeniglesias2**: We would have like a downstairs and outside and then a central location.
**Eileeniglesias2**: But the upstairs, the rest of the outside and there's a members lounge that would not be like rented out just to us.
**Eileeniglesias2**: There would still be like people just going there to smoke cigars.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So it would be kind of weird.
**Eileeniglesias2**: We're like mingling with people who weren't invited to the party.
**Eileeniglesias2**: And it's also very expensive.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Like I said, it's a seven thousand dollar minimum spend like open bar style.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So I feel like for seven grand and you don't even get the whole place.
**Eileeniglesias2**: That's just not a good, that's just not a good price to me personally.
**Eileeniglesias2**: But I don't know, he might feel different so that I just put it in there anyways.
**Luke**: Yeah.
**Luke**: So I'm just typing to him because he's like, keep me on the loop.
**Luke**: So he said, you know, I think it's fine.
**Luke**: The biggest thing for me is just if we have any numbers, especially the aquarium.
**Luke**: So I think he really, really wants to check the aquarium as an option for him.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Can you ask him if he looked at the videos of Red Door?
**Luke**: He did.
**Luke**: He said I saw some of the ones.
**Luke**: But no, I don't think he didn't watch the video.
**Luke**: I want to tell him right now, watch the videos.
**Luke**: Okay.
**Luke**: But he.
**Luke**: I'm going to keep calling this guy something.
**Luke**: I'm going to take a. I'm going to book a fly there.
**Eileeniglesias2**: No, we'll go like we, we live right near the aquarium.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Like I don't mind going but like if he's like, super set on at least getting pricing for the aquarium.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I just have a feeling it's gonna be out of our budget.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Like, I have a feeling it's gonna be really expensive because it's the aquarium, you know what I mean?
**Eileeniglesias2**: To, like, rent out.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Like, I. I remember I had it.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Actually.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I remembered I had an event there when I was in, like, ninth grade.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Like, freshman year of high school.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I was in jrotc and they hosted the military ball there.
**Eileeniglesias2**: And it is a.
**Eileeniglesias2**: It is a nice space.
**Eileeniglesias2**: It is a nice venue, but it feels very corporate.
**Eileeniglesias2**: It feels very stiff.
**Eileeniglesias2**: It doesn't really have any life or character to it.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I mean, sure, you've got the fishes and stuff, and that's pretty to look at, but that's kind of all there is.
**Eileeniglesias2**: That gives it a vibe, you know what I mean?
**Eileeniglesias2**: So that's why I've just been kind of apprehensive on it.
**Eileeniglesias2**: But if he's, like, just set on it, Samantha and I can just show up there tomorrow and see if we can.
**Luke**: Yeah, I think.
**Luke**: You know what?
**Luke**: I think he just wants a number.
**Luke**: Even if it's, like, you know, out of budget, but still, he wants to see a number.
**Luke**: That's fine.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah, okay.
**Luke**: As long as it showed to him.
**Bclymer**: The problem with the aquarium is it's run by a separate organization.
**Bclymer**: That's the problem turning up there.
**Bclymer**: Like, I called.
**Bclymer**: So when I was on the aquarium, I called all the numbers, like, every single one of them, like the child care center, just to get someone.
**Bclymer**: Apparently, that's a separate entity to the aquarium completely.
**Bclymer**: So what I probably will suggest is that you're going to find the same thing, which is we don't do it.
**Bclymer**: You know what I mean?
**Bclymer**: And so they're like.
**Bclymer**: You're like, ah, damn.
**Bclymer**: So you just be prepared that it's going to be a complete waste of time.
**Bclymer**: But if you come, maybe there might be something that they can do.
**Bclymer**: But yeah, just to find her number, Jacqueline's and.
**Bclymer**: And Rogers and stuff like that.
**Bclymer**: If they're not.
**Bclymer**: If they're not even picking up.
**Bclymer**: And Jacqueline should be.
**Bclymer**: Maybe not Roger, but Jacqueline should be as the.
**Bclymer**: The.
**Luke**: You know what?
**Luke**: Let me check right now.
**Eileeniglesias2**: And she hates me.
**Luke**: Yeah.
**Eileeniglesias2**: No, I mean, I've been calling her.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I tried calling her multiple times between yesterday and today.
**Eileeniglesias2**: And I mean, at this point, it's like we have four weeks left to start planning this event, and we don't even have a venue selected.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Like, we have to just make a decision on something because we're not Going to have an event if we don't.
**Eileeniglesias2**: You know what I mean?
**Eileeniglesias2**: So I think, like, if we can't get a hold of the aquarium, then.
**Bclymer**: Meaning the one that you missed that, Brandon, was if Brandon's in the line was if it's not selected by today or tomorrow, he's going to push it by two weeks.
**Eileeniglesias2**: He's going to push the event by two weeks.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So, okay, so then there's leeway on the date of the event.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I thought we were, like, set on August 23, but that's good to know.
**Bclymer**: That was.
**Bclymer**: That was from last call.
**Bclymer**: Depending on whether he wants to do it or not, there's a different thing.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Okay.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Okay, cool.
**Eileeniglesias2**: All right.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Is Luke joining us?
**Eileeniglesias2**: Do we know?
**Luke**: I don't think so, guys.
**Luke**: I think it's just us.
**Luke**: Samantha is running late.
**Luke**: Brandon wasn't aware of the meeting, and I think it's just us.
**Luke**: I'm not sure, but I already told him to watch the Red door videos on WhatsApp.
**Luke**: And I told him that we'll try to come up with a number for the aquarium.
**Luke**: And, yeah, he said, that's the only thing you just want to know.
**Luke**: And the rest for my size.
**Luke**: So the guys, the extra things are starting, like, to text me, for example, the saxophone is like, hey, do you have already a decision?
**Luke**: The magician as well.
**Luke**: Do you have a decision?
**Luke**: The drawers get the speed drawers also.
**Luke**: So I've been telling them that we're going to make a decision, but just to let you know, they are kind of, like, bushy, too.
**Luke**: So on my end.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I mean, Samantha and I had kind of, like, some questions that we wanted to ask Brandon.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I'm trying to see, like, is there anything that we.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Because that's the thing is, like, I don't want us to, like, come up with stuff, and then we don't have, like, Brandon's approval or something, and then it's kind of just, like a waste of our time.
**Bclymer**: What's the stuff?
**Bclymer**: What do you talk, like, in terms of the aesthetic?
**Eileeniglesias2**: No, it's more so, like, budgeting.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So how much is the max that we want to spend on marketing for the event?
**Eileeniglesias2**: Because we already have a media company that we're going to be working with that we've worked with in the past.
**Eileeniglesias2**: They're great, but we just need to know what the budget is.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Because if they.
**Eileeniglesias2**: He only wants to spend a hundred dollars, and we're going to get a hundred bucks worth of content.
**Eileeniglesias2**: But if the budget's like 350, then.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Then, okay.
**Eileeniglesias2**: We have a little bit more wiggle room here into the amount and the quality of content that we can produce for the event.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I'm assuming neither of y' all know the answer to that.
**Bclymer**: Well, I do necessarily.
**Bclymer**: Like, I want like a single.
**Bclymer**: He's, he's.
**Bclymer**: The purpose for this was when he went to sign up for Dave's event, Dave said like, we'll have a whole thing on you and everything.
**Bclymer**: And there was no microphone that, you know, you were at the event.
**Bclymer**: It was kind of, I think you would know more of kind of like the clusterfucker trying to get content and this and that.
**Bclymer**: So that was like an issue where we were like, okay, well we want to have designated people.
**Bclymer**: Like the whole point was to get social media content as well so that they can use it for future events as well as use it for social media.
**Bclymer**: But it wasn't like we're only doing this for social media.
**Bclymer**: It's also they want to have a good party as well.
**Bclymer**: So I think a little bit of budget towards that for sure, 100%.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Okay.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Because there is a difference between like pre event marketing and then like actual like day of event photographers, videographers that will be capturing content live while, while the event is going on.
**Eileeniglesias2**: We're much more so talking about like as a pre event content, right?
**Eileeniglesias2**: Getting pictures, videos, what not promoting the event so that we get more signups.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Because that's going to be the biggest thing, right?
**Eileeniglesias2**: Is like one of the most important parts of this whole thing to Brandon is what, like that's another thing that we wanted to define out is like what kind of women does he want there?
**Eileeniglesias2**: What is the age range?
**Eileeniglesias2**: What are the characteristics, the attributes, both like physically and then also interpersonally so that we can have a good idea of what kind of target audience this marketing should be going out to.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Do you happen to know or have an idea of that?
**Bclymer**: Oh yeah, just he.
**Bclymer**: His type, I guess that was about it.
**Bclymer**: That's what I got.
**Bclymer**: Basically.
**Bclymer**: Like if, if it's necessary to get the numbers there, then whatever budget we have to put to get the numbers there, that's fine.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Can you break down what you just said?
**Eileeniglesias2**: Whatever budget we have to put that.
**Eileeniglesias2**: What does that mean?
**Bclymer**: Well, basically there was like three things that he wanted to do, which was an open bar because the rest of the events that open bar, he wanted.
**Bclymer**: He wanted hot, attractive, young, like younger, you know, 20s to, you know, not older, older women.
**Bclymer**: And it was basically how, how can we get that done?
**Bclymer**: That's it.
**Bclymer**: That's Pretty much it.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I mean, if that's it, that.
**Eileeniglesias2**: That makes my job super simple.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Because we know plenty of hot, attractive, single women in Tampa.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Is that also, like, another criteria for him?
**Eileeniglesias2**: Like, they have to be single or.
**Bclymer**: I mean.
**Bclymer**: I mean, I think that's like any guy, really.
**Bclymer**: So I think that would be definitely something that they would be looking for because it's also Luke.
**Bclymer**: I'm guessing Luke is also single.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Right.
**Bclymer**: So for him as well.
**Bclymer**: So I think it would be a mixture of maybe, like, maybe we could talk to Luke as well.
**Bclymer**: Be like, I guess Brandon's kind of the one that's pushing it forward.
**Bclymer**: But yeah, like, I think the thing, you know what everything's going to be coming to play is like the venue locked in.
**Bclymer**: Perfect.
**Bclymer**: And then it's just like we create the potter for.
**Bclymer**: Create the posh.
**Bclymer**: Posh or whatever.
**Bclymer**: The patch thing, whatever it is, and just start to get numbers in there.
**Bclymer**: And if we have to do marketing before that, then just like Brandon, we got to do marketing to get the types of numbers that you want.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah, exactly.
**Bclymer**: So it's like, if that's necessary, then you tell.
**Bclymer**: That's kind of like, we gotta get that done.
**Bclymer**: That's a necessity, you know?
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah.
**Eileeniglesias2**: And I think that we had already discussed that.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So that's.
**Eileeniglesias2**: That's why I'm like, what's the budget?
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah, like, we need to know, like, what breakup.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yes.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Maria.
**Luke**: Sorry to interrupt you guys.
**Luke**: So Brandon is asking.
**Luke**: I really like the red door place.
**Luke**: It looks really cool.
**Luke**: So I told him the cost, and he says, is the 7K is just the base cost or does it come with stuff?
**Luke**: So I know you put there, like, they can provide catering, tables lining and stuff.
**Luke**: But that's part of the 7K.
**Eileeniglesias2**: No.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So I'm.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So the pricing is.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I'll break down the pricing for you guys.
**Eileeniglesias2**: And then I think it might be best if Brandon, like, and I hop on a call and I can break down the pricing for him as well, because it's kind of hard to visualize.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So there's the.
**Eileeniglesias2**: The event venue is broken out into three different zones.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So zone A is the first part of the video walkthrough.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Then the dining room is zone B.
**Eileeniglesias2**: And then the back room with, like, the red sofa and everything in the kitchen.
**Eileeniglesias2**: That is zone C. So the 7, it's 7,500.
**Eileeniglesias2**: And that is for the entire space.
**Eileeniglesias2**: And then there's two separate outdoor areas that are huge as well.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So that is just for the venue.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Now, if that price is too high, we can also just do zone A and B, which is all the way up to the dining room.
**Eileeniglesias2**: And then we'd have all the outdoor areas as well.
**Eileeniglesias2**: We just wouldn't have that back room.
**Eileeniglesias2**: That is 5,500 now that.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Now that includes servers.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So there's three staff and they have outfits that they wear.
**Eileeniglesias2**: That's.
**Eileeniglesias2**: That was I showed at the end of the video.
**Eileeniglesias2**: They are 2250 an hour for.
**Eileeniglesias2**: And I think it's going to be nine hours.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So they help us set up all the way to the end of the event cleanup.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Right.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Then there's lighting, which is I think 15 bucks a light.
**Eileeniglesias2**: And he said we'll need about 25.
**Eileeniglesias2**: And then the high top tables are I think 1750 per table as well or something like that.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Something around that range.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So the price is just for the venue.
**Eileeniglesias2**: It doesn't include anything additional.
**Eileeniglesias2**: And then they also, they do catering as well.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So he can like come up with a whole menu for us.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I'm assuming we might want to do like hors d', oeuvres, appetizers, and then he can have all that catered and then brought in and set up as well on that dining room table, which I thought was a really, really cute vibe.
**Eileeniglesias2**: And then.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah, that's pretty much.
**Luke**: I'm going to tell him that it's better.
**Luke**: I mean, I kind of summarize what you said, but I'm going to tell him that it's better if you explain him Oracle, so he understands better.
**Bclymer**: Maria, before you do that, I've got a number for the aquarium.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And it's 13, 500.
**Luke**: Oh, my gosh.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I had a feeling.
**Bclymer**: Is the average price for a wedding.
**Bclymer**: That's.
**Bclymer**: That's what I've got off Weddingwire, which is kind of like it looked at.
**Bclymer**: That's the average.
**Bclymer**: So it's like reception is four grand starting price faster.
**Bclymer**: Like it just including everything.
**Bclymer**: So it's like 13, 500 is what they're looking at.
**Luke**: Okay, perfect.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Up to 4,000 guests.
**Eileeniglesias2**: That's also the thing is like, do we need that much space?
**Eileeniglesias2**: Like we're.
**Eileeniglesias2**: We're going to have 130 people.
**Eileeniglesias2**: 150 people max.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Right.
**Eileeniglesias2**: That's kind of like what we're targeting.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Feel like they're going to get a little bit lost.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I know I was lost.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Like we had like, sorry, I wouldn't.
**Luke**: Read what she said.
**Luke**: What he said too.
**Luke**: Well, the, the way Brandon will say, well, holy.
**Luke**: That has to be for the entire thing for the aquarium.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, probably wasn't, but yeah, that's just an average estimate.
**Bclymer**: I don't think that's a price, but that's just something I found on the website.
**Bclymer**: I'm just looking through reviews and seeing how much they say.
**Bclymer**: And.
**Luke**: Yeah, I'm going to.
**Luke**: I'm going to tell him that he's.
**Luke**: I mean, regardless, it's very expensive just for him to kind of, like, understand that.
**Luke**: Okay.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I was thinking maybe in the sheet that we have, he can go in and on each of the dropdowns of, like, videographer, saxophonist, dj, whatever, he can put, like, what the budget max is like, I can add a smaller.
**Eileeniglesias2**: And that way we have a frame of reference in mind as we're reaching out to people so that we're not accidentally, like, thinking, oh, 500 bucks for this, that's fine.
**Eileeniglesias2**: And he's like, whoa, whoa, wait.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Actually, I only wanted to spend 250 because that's kind of why we haven't, like, really been reaching out to.
**Eileeniglesias2**: To all the extras that we're doing, because we need to.
**Eileeniglesias2**: We need to get that pinned down, obviously.
**Luke**: Yeah, I will let him know that, because you're right.
**Luke**: Last time when I was calling for another saxophone is he actually asked me what was the budget in mind, but I didn't have, like, a specific answer.
**Luke**: I was like, well, the general budget can be these, remember?
**Luke**: He was like, okay, but for entertainment.
**Luke**: And I was like, no, I don't.
**Luke**: I don't have that answer for you.
**Luke**: So, yeah.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Okay, cool.
**Eileeniglesias2**: All right.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Was there anything that we wanted to discuss in terms of.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I feel like right now we're.
**Eileeniglesias2**: We're doing pretty well about managing the task load.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I don't feel like any of us really have, like, super directly defined roles of what we're supposed to be doing, but I feel like no one's really duplicating efforts.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Like, we're all kind of just on the same page with everything.
**Eileeniglesias2**: But did you guys want to kind of define out roles of, like, all right, this is what Sam and I are doing.
**Eileeniglesias2**: This is what Maria will be doing.
**Eileeniglesias2**: This is what Sam will be doing.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Like, is that easier for y', all, or should we just keep doing what we've been doing?
**Bclymer**: That's a good question.
**Bclymer**: I think basically the.
**Bclymer**: I guess we could split it up into, like, once the venue's solidified, then we've got the vendors, and then we've got the budgeting, tracking, and then we've got, like, the aesthetic kind of vibe and stuff.
**Bclymer**: So I guess people can go into their roles after this venue's Done.
**Eileeniglesias2**: If that makes sense.
**Bclymer**: Because I think we're all in a bit of a.
**Bclymer**: Kind of twiddling out a little bit.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, exactly what we're doing.
**Luke**: Until it's so for Brandon, so far, Brandon is liking Red Door.
**Luke**: Really?
**Luke**: He's like, well, no, definitely Rudder is a better contender.
**Luke**: It's a much stronger contender.
**Luke**: So, yeah.
**Luke**: And then I'm going to tell him to discuss that with Luke because he thought Luke was in the meeting.
**Luke**: And I was like, no, it's only Sam, Alien and myself.
**Luke**: So, you know, just trying to convince him as well for the other things that we have there.
**Luke**: But yeah, and for my role, you know, I mean, I can do whatever Sam or Brandon asked me to do.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So.
**Bclymer**: I think that a thing that you can reiterate to Brandon is that because he's kind of hung up on this penguin idea.
**Bclymer**: They're just.
**Bclymer**: They're very small penguins.
**Bclymer**: And then I just read a review like this is a couple of years ago that six out of the nine penguins died.
**Bclymer**: And.
**Bclymer**: And so they kind of didn't do it for their wedding.
**Bclymer**: So I'm not sure if they're continuing to do that.
**Bclymer**: I don't know why.
**Bclymer**: So there's that as well as I think inside the aquarium there would be some limitations on vibration, so the DJ couldn't be inside lighting as well.
**Bclymer**: So I think it would be more.
**Bclymer**: You would actually be like.
**Bclymer**: Because I'm having a look.
**Bclymer**: And I was like, why is the reservation of all these weddings inside the cave and nothing else?
**Bclymer**: And it seems like that has to be kind of quiet.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I was thinking that the 13,000 is not going to be well spent because you're going to be outside anyway, if that makes sense.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: If you can relate that to him, I'll literally.
**Bclymer**: I can send some.
**Luke**: I will.
**Bclymer**: The website as well.
**Bclymer**: If it was me doing this.
**Bclymer**: It's the easiest thing that I could see in my entire kind of head is like, all right, we're fucking around too much.
**Bclymer**: Let's just book that in.
**Bclymer**: Because it's the easiest thing.
**Bclymer**: It's a straight line for that.
**Bclymer**: I'll put in the chat here.
**Bclymer**: That's the wedding wire for the Tampa, Florida stuff.
**Bclymer**: Obviously it's a wedding website, so it is not showing any events.
**Bclymer**: But just say, like, Sam thinks, you know, it's not.
**Bclymer**: Not 100% like, it's truth that these.
**Bclymer**: These are some reasons why that it might not be a great idea.
**Bclymer**: If that makes sense.
**Bclymer**: It's still there.
**Bclymer**: It still be fucking epic if we get an emperor.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah.
**Eileeniglesias2**: And I like, me and Samantha, like, we walked in the door into Red Door, and we fell in love with the ve.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Obviously giant red doors, like, ceiling high.
**Eileeniglesias2**: And there's so many different, like, very unique pieces of artwork because the guy.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Maria, are you local to Florida?
**Eileeniglesias2**: To Tampa?
**Luke**: I can't.
**Luke**: I'm with my daughter.
**Eileeniglesias2**: No, no, no.
**Eileeniglesias2**: You live.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Where do you live?
**Luke**: In Colombia.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Oh, okay.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Girl, I thought you were, like, here in Florida cooking it with us.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Okay.
**Luke**: No, I was going to, like.
**Luke**: I mean, I want to bring my daughter and I'm just kidding.
**Luke**: I was like, I'll help you guys, but.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Okay, well, then this isn't gonna make any sense because neither of y' all are, like, Tampa natives.
**Eileeniglesias2**: But there's this really cool, like, glass blowing and welding workshop that makes crazy art pieces that are all around Tampa.
**Eileeniglesias2**: And he owns that place as well as Red Door, so that's why a lot of the really cool, unique sculptures and whatnot.
**Eileeniglesias2**: That's because he owns that shop that makes the sculptures, and a lot of those are his designs.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So he designed the entire thing himself.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah, I agree.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I think that's going to be, like, our best bet right now.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So hopefully we can get Brandon and Luke on board.
**Eileeniglesias2**: And then I. I told the guy because he thought he had already had someone booked for the 23rd, and we were freaking out a little bit, but he was like, okay, no, it's the 16th, so the 23rd is still open.
**Eileeniglesias2**: That obviously we want to lock that date in as soon as possible.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So fingers crossed that we can get that.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yes.
**Luke**: Brandon says in the aquarium.
**Luke**: Bye.
**Luke**: I just tell him, you know music.
**Luke**: Don't you tell me, Sam.
**Luke**: For the penguins and everything.
**Luke**: He's like, okay, then fine.
**Luke**: Let's crush it up.
**Luke**: So.
**Luke**: So I'm just telling him right now that you ladies fall in love with the red door.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah.
**Luke**: Fell in love with the red door.
**Eileeniglesias2**: As creative directors, we feel that this is the space that's going to fit our vibe the best.
**Eileeniglesias2**: For sure.
**Eileeniglesias2**: The mood lighting is great, too.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I don't know if you all saw the videos of, like, the red lighting.
**Luke**: Yes, I saw that.
**Luke**: Yeah.
**Eileeniglesias2**: And then you.
**Eileeniglesias2**: When you go outside, because it's obviously a fireh and there's actually a pole there that you can slide.
**Eileeniglesias2**: You can't slide down it during the event, but Samantha.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I got a video, Samantha sliding down the firefighter pole.
**Eileeniglesias2**: It was super funny.
**Eileeniglesias2**: But when you go outside, everything outside is lit up with beautiful, like, string lights.
**Eileeniglesias2**: And then up in the tower that is lit up in Red at night.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So it.
**Eileeniglesias2**: It casts this, like, beautiful mood lighting even when you're outdoors.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah, I'm excited for you guys.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Well, Sam, for you to see it when.
**Eileeniglesias2**: When you come down to Tampa and we'll send lots of videos to you.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Maria.
**Luke**: Yes, one day I will go.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yes.
**Luke**: Okay.
**Luke**: So I just.
**Luke**: I tell Brandon all the things that we talked today just to, you know, keep him on the look, even when he's in the plane.
**Luke**: I just really told him, please decide we look the budget for each of the vendor.
**Luke**: So he said, yeah, this is a must.
**Luke**: So I told him to please have these ready before next week because we need to fill out.
**Luke**: I mean, and also, you know, people are contacting me like, you already have a budget?
**Luke**: And I'm like, no.
**Luke**: So, okay, so that something else you think I need to tell Brandon, Sam or Elaine, something that I.
**Bclymer**: No, not really.
**Bclymer**: If he's going to make a decision and make a decision now so we can, like, he doesn't have to put it.
**Bclymer**: Put it for another two weeks, if possible.
**Luke**: Okay.
**Luke**: So I'm not sure I'm going to tell him that.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, he was the one to make the decision by Saturday of being like, it needs to be locked in by Saturday.
**Bclymer**: If we push it.
**Bclymer**: I don't want him to push it, just either.
**Luke**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Murray, we've done enough in the back end for, like, the miscellaneous stuff.
**Bclymer**: I think that that could be handled very quickly, which is nice.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: You know, we can.
**Bclymer**: We can scrap the fucking saxophone.
**Bclymer**: Like, all you need is like the DJ and the starting to get the numbers into.
**Bclymer**: Into the posh.
**Bclymer**: What?
**Bclymer**: What?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, part of.
**Bclymer**: What's the other one?
**Eileeniglesias2**: The events, like, app, like where we're gonna have tickets.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah, I think it's just posh.
**Bclymer**: Posh.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So, yeah, if we could get that, I guess, like, four weeks out is a great time and it can be literally launched asap, if that makes sense.
**Bclymer**: Because then we can do all the back end of the food and then that's where the SOP is going to come really handy in terms of like.
**Bclymer**: All right, so this has to be done.
**Bclymer**: Phase one, phase two, phase three.
**Bclymer**: Eileen, I don't know if you saw that.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, you did.
**Bclymer**: You did.
**Bclymer**: So that's when we can refer back to that.
**Bclymer**: Because once the first main things up.
**Bclymer**: Should be sweet.
**Bclymer**: Should be no problem.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah, for sure.
**Luke**: Elaine, Brandon is asking between the red door and the vault.
**Luke**: In the vault.
**Luke**: Which one?
**Eileeniglesias2**: The.
**Eileeniglesias2**: The.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Wait, what do you mean?
**Luke**: The vault?
**Luke**: The venues between the red door and the vault.
**Luke**: That's the other one.
**Luke**: Right.
**Eileeniglesias2**: There's the vault.
**Eileeniglesias2**: There's the grand cathedral Cigars.
**Eileeniglesias2**: There was between.
**Luke**: So he's asking why the ladies prefer the red door in the vault.
**Luke**: I mean, like, between those two.
**Luke**: Which ones will you guys.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Oh, I mean, I haven't seen the vault, but personally, like, after seeing.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Pick like, pictures of the vault, I don't know if it fits our theme as well as Red Door.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Gotcha.
**Bclymer**: Gotcha.
**Bclymer**: What's the.
**Bclymer**: Is the vault kind of just a spot in inside Tampa, or is it.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah, I mean, it.
**Eileeniglesias2**: It's nice.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Don't get me wrong, but it's just really basic.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Like, once again, it feels kind of dead and cold and not really like it has life.
**Bclymer**: It's got, like, what, 20.
**Bclymer**: It's got huge ceilings.
**Eileeniglesias2**: It looks like that's the biggest thing.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Is.
**Eileeniglesias2**: It's got giant.
**Eileeniglesias2**: That's what's called wall.
**Eileeniglesias2**: But.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: So, yeah, I. I would say the red door simply.
**Bclymer**: I read a book back in the day.
**Bclymer**: It's like how to throw a Party.
**Bclymer**: Like, that was super funny.
**Bclymer**: And the more intimate kind of lower ceiling places are always better than higher sailings.
**Eileeniglesias2**: 100%.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah.
**Eileeniglesias2**: That just feels kind of like you get lost a little bit, like there's too much space.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And then the zoo.
**Bclymer**: What was.
**Bclymer**: What was Brandon's idea about the zoo?
**Bclymer**: Was that on the.
**Bclymer**: That was 37, 500 to 87.
**Bclymer**: 500.
**Luke**: The zoo.
**Bclymer**: The zoo Tampa.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, that was.
**Eileeniglesias2**: There was another venue.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I don't know.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Not a big fan of the zoo.
**Bclymer**: Is it far away?
**Eileeniglesias2**: It is, yeah.
**Eileeniglesias2**: It's kind of.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I mean, it's not like, as central as Red Door.
**Eileeniglesias2**: And then it's also, I think, all outdoor.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Like, I've been to the zoo before.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And then amateur works was amateur or whatever it is.
**Bclymer**: That was not on the menu as well.
**Bclymer**: That was not good.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I think it's on there.
**Eileeniglesias2**: But I think I remember, like, hearing back the fireflies notes from the last meeting that it.
**Eileeniglesias2**: For whatever reason, we just felt like too many events have been thrown there and we wanted to do something, like, new and creative and like, nothing's not something that's been done again and again.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I think that's why we ended up, like, xing that one out.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So basically what we've got is Florida aquariums out because of the.
**Bclymer**: The numbers that we got.
**Bclymer**: And also, I think it's just not going to work.
**Bclymer**: Amateur works is our.
**Bclymer**: This Tampa zoo was too far.
**Bclymer**: And so you've either got the vault, grand Cathedral or red door.
**Bclymer**: That's Brandon's decision to make.
**Bclymer**: Is that correct?
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yep.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Luke**: So I told him about the budget and he said, what do you mean?
**Luke**: I mean, we already have like an entire thing.
**Luke**: You guys have to figure out how to get the most out of the budget.
**Luke**: And he said, yeah, that's true, but it was suggesting, you know, that what's money wise between.
**Luke**: For example, security is good.
**Luke**: 500 versus 1000, 2000 versus saxophonies.
**Luke**: Or so he's typing.
**Luke**: Let's see what he says.
**Luke**: Because, yeah, I mean, it'll be good to have that clear.
**Bclymer**: I didn't think he'd want to do it.
**Luke**: He's going to say, well, you guys figure it out.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so if he doesn't want to do it, it's like, I'll create a sheet of like.
**Bclymer**: All right, if.
**Bclymer**: If we do this amount of money, because basically what it is, is like, if we play.
**Bclymer**: If it's like, what's the.
**Bclymer**: What's the budget?
**Bclymer**: 20 grand or 25 grand?
**Bclymer**: I can't remember.
**Luke**: 20.
**Bclymer**: 20 grand.
**Bclymer**: So basically we've only got 13 grand.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, that's.
**Bclymer**: That's the question.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So it's like skills way like that.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Most important things that I would be looking at is more.
**Bclymer**: And that seven grand is that with bar.
**Bclymer**: Without bar.
**Eileeniglesias2**: The seven grand for all the.
**Eileeniglesias2**: All.
**Eileeniglesias2**: None of the venues come with anything.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Like, that's just the base price for the venue itself.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Except for Grand Cathedral, that does come with an open bar up to $7,000.
**Eileeniglesias2**: But you only.
**Eileeniglesias2**: You only get access to three areas.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Like, you don't rent out the whole space.
**Bclymer**: The whole space?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, for sure.
**Bclymer**: I'll come up with something.
**Bclymer**: I'll see if I can put in the chat what you guys can think.
**Luke**: So he said, we're not setting a budget for each one item.
**Luke**: That doesn't make sense.
**Luke**: You start with what you have to have.
**Luke**: Venue, food, boo.
**Luke**: Security, dj, then entertainment options with what you have left, eyes, lush figure, fire, dance, etc.
**Luke**: So I said, okay, fine.
**Luke**: Sam will create a sheet with average pricing on each.
**Luke**: We'll see.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah, well, we'll figure it out then.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Like as sounds good.
**Luke**: You're right.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Is as people, like, ask us what our budget is, we can just say, like, what.
**Eileeniglesias2**: What is your price?
**Eileeniglesias2**: Like, tell us what your price is and we'll see if that fits into our budget.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Like, just redirect the question back on to them.
**Eileeniglesias2**: And like, we have to force people to give us a number of like, how.
**Eileeniglesias2**: How much is your Price, like, what do you want to charge me for this?
**Eileeniglesias2**: And then we can start putting that in the sheet and then compare and contrast also, like, different vendors and.
**Eileeniglesias2**: All right, is this one.
**Eileeniglesias2**: How much is this one?
**Eileeniglesias2**: How much is that one?
**Eileeniglesias2**: And then we can just figure it out like that.
**Bclymer**: For sure.
**Bclymer**: It's always going to be more expensive, but it'll be 25.
**Bclymer**: If we do 20.
**Bclymer**: That's where it'll.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I don't know if they want to like us to go over budget, but if he's not giving us, like, numbers for specific line items, it's.
**Eileeniglesias2**: It's going to be harder to stay within budget.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Unless he's like going in and approving every single thing, like, which he's.
**Eileeniglesias2**: He might have to like.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So, Marie, you, You.
**Bclymer**: You've started that, which is good.
**Bclymer**: And then we can kind of just start to take away, like the magician being three grand.
**Bclymer**: It's like, okay, well, that's.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Three grand.
**Luke**: His name is Gary something, and he said 3,000 for two hours.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Luke**: I was like, no, it's not gonna happen.
**Luke**: So I, I had another person, another magician.
**Luke**: His name is Armory.
**Luke**: And his budget, I think it's.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I know Armory.
**Luke**: Actually, the one for 3,000.
**Luke**: The other guy was 3,500.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Luke**: So that's the thing.
**Luke**: In each for two hours.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I'll learn the car tricks.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I'll pay me the money.
**Luke**: I have a. I have a friend that is a magician.
**Eileeniglesias2**: For real.
**Luke**: He's so good.
**Luke**: And now he's very old.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So that's, that's where I think what we can do is look at, like.
**Bclymer**: All right, so they're.
**Bclymer**: They're like the saxophonist is out, the magician's out.
**Bclymer**: Like, what else can.
**Bclymer**: The ice sculptor is in.
**Bclymer**: Because the ice sculptor was in like 800 bucks.
**Bclymer**: That's cool.
**Eileeniglesias2**: As.
**Bclymer**: So for.
**Bclymer**: For four, like, for one magician or like four miscellaneous things, we could like, work that out, I think so to figure out some bit more of like, I don't know, something.
**Bclymer**: I don't know.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Oh, another thing we wanted to add was a cigar roller.
**Eileeniglesias2**: That's because the outside area, he has like eight giant cigar trays, and there's a giant outside area.
**Eileeniglesias2**: And we want to do a bar outside near the cigar area that is only serving like, old fashions, like whiskey, brandy.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Like, that way the guys can sit out there and have their cigar and they're like fancy little drink.
**Eileeniglesias2**: And then we want a cute.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Do like curated bar menus with like specialty drinks for the rest of the bars.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: For sure.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Okay.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Sounds good.
**Luke**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: All right, cool.
**Bclymer**: I'll.
**Bclymer**: I'll.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, for sure.
**Bclymer**: And didn't Marie didn't have Brandon have like, he wanted be like labels on the alcohol as well?
**Bclymer**: Like, I remember something.
**Bclymer**: This was a little while ago that he paid for his label to be on an alcohol bottle.
**Luke**: Oh, yeah.
**Luke**: So we did the.
**Luke**: The Alito Aliado.
**Eileeniglesias2**: What?
**Luke**: You know for how long?
**Luke**: He will kill you.
**Luke**: So we did the.
**Luke**: A little drink and actually I asked.
**Luke**: We came up with that with ChatGPT and we were asking with.
**Luke**: So we came up with a menu.
**Luke**: I don't know if.
**Luke**: But maybe we can come up with B and L or Brandon and Luke or lb, you know, type of drink, something like that.
**Luke**: Because that was.
**Luke**: The Alito drink was for the man and then it was the other one.
**Luke**: I think it was called a little muse or something that.
**Luke**: For the ladies.
**Luke**: So we can come up with something for Brandon and Luke.
**Luke**: That's fine.
**Luke**: That's not the.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Brandon can be like Brandon's specific drink of choice and then the Luke can be like Luke specific.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Like, I think that could be really cool.
**Luke**: Yeah, that's cool.
**Luke**: We can come up with something nice.
**Luke**: Yeah.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So maybe.
**Bclymer**: Maybe we should definitely have.
**Bclymer**: Once Maria, the thing's locked in, maybe a bit more of a aesthetic kind of vibe branding call where Brandon and Luke are not on us.
**Bclymer**: Just both Sam, Zylene and Maria just.
**Bclymer**: I'm saying that for the, for the.
**Bclymer**: For the.
**Bclymer**: The fireflies so that we kind of get a vibe of like what specifically we're looking for.
**Bclymer**: So like, okay, we need this, we need that.
**Bclymer**: We need this.
**Bclymer**: We need the brochure.
**Bclymer**: We need this, we need that just to kind of like to understand what we're going through.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Samantha did create a canva that I'll share with you guys as well with a color palette that we were thinking of.
**Eileeniglesias2**: It's very much like muted tones, like black, red, burgundy, eggplant, purple, gold, silver.
**Bclymer**: Has that been changed after seeing Red Room or not?
**Eileeniglesias2**: So that that aesthetic is exactly the vibe that Red Room fits.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Like, that's what you would picture people wearing to an event there.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So I think the, the.
**Eileeniglesias2**: The part that sold us was that like, our vision and our like, idea, an aesthetic that we had in mind is what fit really well.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So I'll share that with you guys and.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Because that way.
**Eileeniglesias2**: And obviously we want Brandon and Luke to approve it as well.
**Eileeniglesias2**: But from my understanding, we're going for kind of like this speakeasy, jazzy, kind of high level classy like vibe.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So yeah, we'll, we'll start coming up with like a lookbook as well and, and share that so that we can wrap our minds around branding and whatnot.
**Bclymer**: Cool, that's good.
**Luke**: Okay, I'll keep you guys posted when we have the next meeting.
**Luke**: But I asked him, actually, so many of you have.
**Luke**: I know you might have a lot of things on the plate, but maybe if you have the prize sheet soon, maybe we can send it to Brandon and he just can agree to it or something.
**Luke**: So we can.
**Bclymer**: I can get it by this afternoon.
**Bclymer**: Probably like an hour and a half.
**Bclymer**: I can get it for sure.
**Luke**: Yeah.
**Luke**: So I told.
**Luke**: I, I'll share with him and I'll be like, this is the one.
**Luke**: Agree.
**Luke**: Perfect.
**Luke**: So from there we'll just take everything and then.
**Bclymer**: Okay, for sure.
**Bclymer**: Absolutely.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Easy, Brandon.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Sam, are you doing that in the sheet that we created?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Okay, cool.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah, I can do that.
**Bclymer**: I don't know if the budget tracking thing will work for just how I operate with my mind, but I'll make, I'll try and make it work, but basically I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna use ChatGPT and really just nut out the parameters of like what we can use and what for and then we can, can see.
**Bclymer**: Because my only question is like, how much does like a bar like, because.
**Bclymer**: Because his big thing is just the bars got to be free.
**Bclymer**: Is that, are we looking at like, that's costing seven grand, five grand?
**Bclymer**: 12.
**Eileeniglesias2**: It's gonna be expensive.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I think Samantha can probably speak to that better since she's going to be coordinating with those of the bar and they can probably give her a quote.
**Eileeniglesias2**: But it's a four hour event, so I mean, it's going to run us a pretty decent chunk of our budget.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I'm not going to lie.
**Bclymer**: Sure.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: We'll see what we can do.
**Bclymer**: All right, easy.
**Bclymer**: Done.
**Bclymer**: I'll figure some numbers out and see if I can crunch them.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Thanks.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Appreciate you.
**Bclymer**: Cool.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Okay.
**Eileeniglesias2**: All right, guys.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Thanks, Maria.
**Luke**: No, thank you guys for joining.
**Luke**: Just, we'll be, you know, in touch in the chat and everything and then.
**Luke**: Yeah, thank you guys.
**Luke**: Enjoy your weekend.
**Eileeniglesias2**: You too.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Bye.
**Luke**: Bye.
