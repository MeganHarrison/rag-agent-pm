## Transcript
**Jdawson**: All right, this is option number one, which is CMU with the slab on grade.
**Jdawson**: We had an overall overall cost of 9,800,000.
**Jdawson**: We have nine.
**Jdawson**: Nine months of GC.
**Crusin**: What's the total GCS?
**Jdawson**: It's 550,000.
**Crusin**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: The demo, we have BTS.
**Jdawson**: Those are the actual numbers and their mobilization.
**Crusin**: Then I can barely see your screen, but you could zoom in just a little.
**Jdawson**: Okay, this is for concrete storm capture.
**Jdawson**: A four inch pad for.
**Jdawson**: For the storm bolts.
**Jdawson**: And BCS is actual number for it for the other storm.
**Jdawson**: This is for concrete testing.
**Crusin**: Where's Gilbert and Byrd's concrete number?
**Jdawson**: It's down here.
**Crusin**: No, but you guys didn't get a hold of him all day long?
**Jdawson**: I could not get a hold of him, No.
**Jdawson**: I called them and texted him 10 in the morning.
**Jdawson**: I haven't heard back from them.
**Crusin**: Okay, keep going.
**Jdawson**: Okay, this is install.
**Jdawson**: That's a plug number for bcs.
**Crusin**: Did you talk to Bruno and see if that's right?
**Crusin**: No.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I called Bruno a few days ago and he said he wasn't sure yet on.
**Jdawson**: On his install number for the, for the concrete.
**Crusin**: You know for what?
**Jdawson**: I called Bruno a couple days ago and he said he still wasn't sure on his install number for the concrete.
**Jdawson**: He only looked into the our system.
**Jdawson**: This is the, the additional space on the concrete system to account for the pond.
**Crusin**: The what now?
**Crusin**: Pond.
**Jdawson**: This is the number you wanted us to add this morning?
**Jdawson**: I think the additional space for eliminating the ponds.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Crusin**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And then the CMU and also the slab.
**Crusin**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: This is the steel decking.
**Jdawson**: This, this is 60 a square foot.
**Jdawson**: Joel thinks at minimum it's going to be 40 a square foot.
**Jdawson**: But it could be more depending on how the trusses and the columns are spaced.
**Jdawson**: Well, the columns, I guess we're spacing at 50 every 50ft on the exterior.
**Jdawson**: And also columns down the middle at 50ft.
**Crusin**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: But the trust trusses could be spaced differently.
**Jdawson**: That's why we went with 60 a square foot.
**Jdawson**: Then we have the insulation for the cmu.
**Jdawson**: And this is Ari's roofing actual number.
**Crusin**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: The overhead door.
**Jdawson**: We have one overhead door and then the metal door.
**Jdawson**: Well, there's two hollow metal doors and then one double door.
**Jdawson**: The transom windows.
**Jdawson**: This was an actual number from Armor Tech.
**Jdawson**: And then we have the roll up doors.
**Crusin**: So you got three regular roll up doors for 15 grand.
**Crusin**: When you say that's a plug, did you look, you get any pricing for like a 12 foot warehouse roll up door?
**Crusin**: Susan, seriously, it takes two seconds to find that info on online.
**Jdawson**: All right, well, let me see if Kenny might have the back.
**Crusin**: That gives.
**Jdawson**: A breakdown of whether you want a motorized or manual.
**Crusin**: Times two.
**Jdawson**: So it's coming out around 5,000 each on the high end.
**Crusin**: Oh.
**Jdawson**: Plus installation.
**Jdawson**: Total manual is 5,000, motorized is 6,000.
**Crusin**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: All right, that's all I.
**Crusin**: If you tell me, just tell me.
**Crusin**: We got pricing on this, and that's all I need to know.
**Crusin**: I'm think when you say plug, it means no.
**Crusin**: So any wild guess?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, anything.
**Jdawson**: Where anywhere you see plug.
**Jdawson**: If you go into the folder for.
**Crusin**: That section, it has backup for it.
**Crusin**: All right, perfect.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Interior paint.
**Jdawson**: Mike has a cost of 95,000 for.
**Jdawson**: That's for the ceilings and for the walls.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: His quote didn't mention anything about trim on.
**Jdawson**: On the wall around the door and not on the base, so I flipped that number.
**Jdawson**: Stucco.
**Jdawson**: This is Mike's install number of 85,000.
**Jdawson**: And then chat GPT's material cost of 100,000.
**Crusin**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Exterior waterproofing.
**Crusin**: The stucco should do that.
**Crusin**: So he could.
**Crusin**: Painted stucco is waterproofing.
**Jdawson**: So, yeah, that's what we had.
**Jdawson**: We had waterproofing, paint.
**Crusin**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Which is this number right here.
**Jdawson**: Then polished concrete.
**Jdawson**: 250,000.
**Crusin**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And this wall.
**Jdawson**: This.
**Jdawson**: This was Mike's number plus our material.
**Crusin**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And signage.
**Jdawson**: This is just for any miscellaneous interior code required signage.
**Crusin**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Fire.
**Jdawson**: Fire sprinkler.
**Jdawson**: And we.
**Jdawson**: We did look at CMU versus steel cost for fire sprinkler.
**Crusin**: About 30 grand difference between the two.
**Crusin**: Is it.
**Jdawson**: Brook drains?
**Jdawson**: This was after talking to Medicare.
**Jdawson**: They had that cost.
**Crusin**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: This.
**Jdawson**: I think this was a chat GPT.
**Jdawson**: Cause but there were like, four or five RTUs.
**Crusin**: Okay.
**Crusin**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Tom said there wasn't enough information for him to give me anything, and that that includes the crane as well.
**Crusin**: Okay.
**Crusin**: Did you tell him he's gonna have to do it for what we price then?
**Crusin**: Right.
**Jdawson**: This is fire alarm and electrical J and K's number.
**Crusin**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And BCS is earthwork number 100,000 for dewatering.
**Crusin**: Do you remember the well point systems we used at Serena?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah, I don't remember.
**Jdawson**: I think there's, like, a manifold, and then you have the points, and then.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, you have the.
**Jdawson**: Oh, the pump.
**Crusin**: Yeah.
**Crusin**: Call up our buddy Redbeard or Red Feather.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I don't remember him.
**Jdawson**: Old Red Feather, huh?
**Crusin**: It was something like that.
**Jdawson**: I just remember putting the plywood around the generator.
**Jdawson**: And then the neighbor was happy.
**Jdawson**: Oh, my gosh.
**Crusin**: No.
**Crusin**: Her koi fish were able to sleep at night.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And so this is BCS number, utilities, the drive, sidewalk, the retaining walls and site signage.
**Crusin**: Imagine how many times she complained when they were making noise tearing up the new building rope videos and yeah, Tracy sent them everywhere on the Internet.
**Jdawson**: Nothing else to do.
**Jdawson**: The dumpster fence and then bike rack landscaping.
**Jdawson**: We chat.
**Jdawson**: GBT wasn't able to do this.
**Jdawson**: It was too much for.
**Jdawson**: We did send this out to three or four landscaping people but they haven't got back to us yet.
**Jdawson**: So we put 90,000 and then miscellaneous site surveying 25,000 and we have these design fees.
**Jdawson**: These are just based on prices we've had for other projects.
**Crusin**: So get rid of the contingency, make that zero.
**Crusin**: Nope, not that one.
**Crusin**: Just change 5% to zero.
**Crusin**: Okay, so this is for masonry walls, concrete seat, steel structure, revised storm capture.
**Crusin**: And did you.
**Crusin**: I would call Bill and just say Bill, we were budgeting based on your calculations.
**Crusin**: We were budgeting 700 whatever thousand for your storm capture system.
**Crusin**: Does that seem reasonable?
**Jdawson**: And he's just going to raise his costs?
**Jdawson**: Probably might be cheaper than that.
**Crusin**: Tell him we figured 650.
**Crusin**: Huh.
**Crusin**: Well whatever.
**Crusin**: We'll just.
**Jdawson**: We're just ask him, ask him what his number is and then if his number is lower, don't say anything but his number is higher.
**Jdawson**: We can say he won't give a.
**Crusin**: Number but he's smart enough to know I use your square footage numbers and I came up with this based on D square foot.
**Crusin**: I just want to know if we're close.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Crusin**: But we used as numbers so.
**Crusin**: Okay.
**Crusin**: And then what is the other ones?
**Crusin**: So that's one option.
**Crusin**: What is the option to do it the original way and how did you figure and let's look at that one.
**Jdawson**: Do the original as in CMU on the exterior or as in metal building.
**Crusin**: Yeah, what's the difference?
**Crusin**: If it's a pre engineered metal building, what's the total.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, with the slab on compared to this same storm system?
**Crusin**: Yeah, the same one just use a pre engineered building instead of a CMU exterior walls.
**Jdawson**: With the metal building we had a million five hundred thousand which is.
**Crusin**: I.
**Jdawson**: Think a million cheaper because exterior panels we had like 300,000.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, it's million cheaper for the metal building.
**Crusin**: Okay.
**Crusin**: And then the original scope storm system.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, this is, this is with the concrete storm system.
**Crusin**: What's the one with the original storm trap or whatever that stuff's called.
**Jdawson**: So it's, it's pretty similar.
**Jdawson**: Similar cost.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, it's almost.
**Jdawson**: Almost the.
**Crusin**: It's almost the same as what?
**Jdawson**: Almost the.
**Crusin**: Which version is this?
**Jdawson**: This is with the, the R system.
**Jdawson**: Metal building of the R system.
**Crusin**: And that let me look at your detail.
**Crusin**: Like what was your concrete numbers?
**Crusin**: So with that you, what did you just take out?
**Crusin**: Okay, so now you got to add in masonry because they got to build that little detention pond and do the fabrics on the inside.
**Jdawson**: Was that that block on the outside of that pond?
**Crusin**: Yeah, it's a masonry wall.
**Crusin**: They show in a foundation or it's foundation you're going to need for that masonry wall.
**Crusin**: And you need the masonry wall under there.
**Crusin**: And then you'll need the Mirafi fabric.
**Jdawson**: They had schedule, I think we had the fabric.
**Crusin**: You have to figure out just like a little two foot by one foot spread footing to go all around under that.
**Crusin**: Then you'll have to figure out that masonry wall underneath there.
**Crusin**: And then you're going to have the foundations.
**Crusin**: How'd you come up with concrete foundations?
**Crusin**: Is that, that's.
**Crusin**: That accounts for 705 linear feet of what 14 exterior piles would you say?
**Crusin**: Well, you're gonna need, you know, you lay out a foundation plan based on 50 foot column spacings and then you got to put power caps for all of those.
**Crusin**: And then you have to figure if a grade like a perimeter wall, you're gonna have to have a structural, structural foundation and great beam all around the bottom.
**Crusin**: That's why no one.
**Crusin**: What.
**Crusin**: So if you can think about it, you can have concrete piles and you figure four 60 footers per.
**Crusin**: And that's.
**Crusin**: Is that number for the piles in your site?
**Crusin**: In the earthwork number it would be in Division 31 is where you put that.
**Crusin**: So you gotta do a layout, see how many column pads you need.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: We calculated 22 columns based on 50 foot spacing.
**Jdawson**: You got 14 on the exterior walls.
**Crusin**: Then you got eight through the middle to the center.
**Crusin**: So go in there to earthwork and put a line for piles.
**Jdawson**: Just put it.
**Crusin**: Yeah.
**Crusin**: You don't have any.
**Jdawson**: Is this the, the deep foundations or the shallow?
**Jdawson**: Or is it those?
**Jdawson**: That's okay.
**Crusin**: That's with the 22 piles.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so we do need the shallow foundations then.
**Crusin**: Yeah, we got the piles with piles.
**Crusin**: Think about it.
**Crusin**: You're driving all these piles in.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Crusin**: And they cap them.
**Crusin**: That transfers all the load to the pile cap.
**Crusin**: And the pile cap comes up and you have a pedestal on it and it ties into the slab.
**Crusin**: So you figured 26.
**Crusin**: You said 22, that 22.
**Crusin**: So times 4, that's 88 plus bigger another for the perimeter beam, driving in another 40 or so.
**Crusin**: So put 120 of those times whatever 60ft times 60ft times 40 foot, it's $2,400.
**Crusin**: So down in 31 for your piles.
**Jdawson**: I guess Candon had for the pilings this 280,000.
**Jdawson**: He said that's for deep foundations.
**Crusin**: I would say that's.
**Crusin**: I had 307 for that for piles.
**Crusin**: And then your foundations are gonna.
**Crusin**: That's gonna cost.
**Crusin**: I would put 200,000 in there for foundations.
**Crusin**: Get 150 linear foot.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So that, that number is.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Only the deep foundation.
**Crusin**: So.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Well, we'll have to figure these.
**Crusin**: Call it what it is.
**Crusin**: When you say concrete foundation, that's.
**Jdawson**: Shallow foundations.
**Crusin**: So just plug 200,000 in there.
**Crusin**: Pod wall, put 60 grand in for that.
**Crusin**: It might be low, but.
**Crusin**: And then your piles, put them at 307.
**Crusin**: And then detention pond masonry, that's going to be 100,000 at least.
**Crusin**: That slab.
**Crusin**: You're not going to support that slab every 50 foot either.
**Crusin**: And, and hold it on a 12 inch.
**Crusin**: That's probably gonna have to be cut down to she need to double up on like your deep foundations are going to be.
**Crusin**: I would put that at 500,000.
**Crusin**: Really?
**Crusin**: And then your shallow foundations, I'd bump that up to like 350.
**Crusin**: Okay.
**Crusin**: Okay.
**Crusin**: So now go down.
**Crusin**: So we got here.
**Crusin**: So everything else is pretty much the same, you know.
**Crusin**: All right, so now what's the total?
**Crusin**: And this is for a metal building.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Crusin**: So it's the other one.
**Crusin**: So it's like 5, 600,000 more than the storm capture with the old castle system.
**Jdawson**: This is what we had for the slab on grade one.
**Crusin**: Okay.
**Crusin**: So eight, four, nine, seven versus nine one something.
**Crusin**: It's like 700,000 more.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Crusin**: We'll just add all the same stuff in for the masonry.
**Crusin**: Then you'll have it.
**Crusin**: So put them together, just clean it up, look at everything.
**Crusin**: Another time go through it.
**Crusin**: And weird how this isn't wide enough on some of them.
**Jdawson**: Actually a million different.
**Crusin**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: There's a tendency over that as well.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Do you, you, you want us to send these to you with the clarifications?
**Crusin**: Yeah, just go through them one last time, make sure all the numbers add up and everything's the same.
**Crusin**: Yeah.
**Crusin**: And then just put them together with clarifications and I'll look them over and hopefully we can get this sent out tomorrow.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Crusin**: All right.
**Crusin**: Thanks guys.
