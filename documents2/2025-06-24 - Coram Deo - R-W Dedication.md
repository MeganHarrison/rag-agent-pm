## Transcript
**Jbarney**: Hey, everybody.
**Jbarney**: Sorry, I'm running just a couple minutes late here.
**Whall**: No worries.
**Jbarney**: I'm on.
**Jbarney**: I'm on baby watch right now, so.
**Whall**: Oh, all right.
**Jbarney**: Been on call and we're getting ready to go to the hospital here.
**Whall**: Well, this is, this is a testament to your dedication then, AJ.
**Jbarney**: So I didn't get confirmation if David was going to be on or not.
**Jbarney**: I see his note cake.
**Jbarney**: Notetakers in here.
**Jbarney**: Willie, can you just give us a rundown on next steps?
**Jbarney**: Once we get these responses from the landlord, how quick is the turnaround going to be from the city?
**Jbarney**: Are we going to be ready to start laying this out or what are next steps?
**Jbarney**: Really?
**Smackay**: Yeah, I think if we can get the executed copy on this landowners and back to them, I think the city engineer would be fine with you starting the work.
**Smackay**: Right.
**Smackay**: So.
**Jbarney**: Okay.
**Smackay**: It will have to.
**Smackay**: The.
**Smackay**: The.
**Smackay**: The right of way dedication documents will have to be signed on their end by the board of Public works, which has the first and third Wednesday of every month.
**Smackay**: So.
**Jbarney**: Okay.
**Smackay**: But I don't know that he's going to say if, if, if they review it.
**Smackay**: I mean, I think we have to give them a minute to review it, make sure they're good with it.
**Smackay**: But if you give a signed copy to them, I think within days.
**Smackay**: Right.
**Smackay**: A couple days that you'll be able to.
**Smackay**: We'll be able to schedule then us coming out.
**Smackay**: So the next step would be us coming out, tying the site, the survey down to the site and then.
**Smackay**: And staking the right away for you.
**Jbarney**: Yep.
**Smackay**: Yep.
**Whall**: And that's all.
**Jbarney**: Yeah, that's all I need to get going.
**Jbarney**: Jason, is, is for Willie to come out and do his thing.
**Jbarney**: You know, we have the survey and under our contract with them, so they'll.
**Jbarney**: It's really, really just waiting on this landlord to.
**Whall**: Yeah.
**Whall**: And then we're.
**Jbarney**: And then we're ready to go.
**Jbarney**: But we do have to have.
**Jbarney**: Have this done by, by August.
**Jbarney**: So I don't foresee Caramel wanting to like make us wait at all.
**Smackay**: Right.
**Smackay**: Yeah, I actually got an email maybe two.
**Smackay**: Two days ago.
**Smackay**: Yeah, yesterday.
**Smackay**: So when you guys were emailing and Brad, the city engineer, somebody had emailed him and he asked what the status of this work was.
**Smackay**: So I let him know that the right of way documents are done.
**Smackay**: They're just waiting to be executed.
**Smackay**: And I, and I said, I'm like, you know, I'm.
**Smackay**: Can we get started before we have the documents done?
**Smackay**: And he said probably not.
**Smackay**: He'd prefer to have an executed agreement because he.
**Smackay**: I Mean, he would rather not have the path built on private property and then have to fight about it.
**Jbarney**: Right?
**Jbarney**: Right.
**Whall**: Yeah.
**Jbarney**: Yeah.
**Jbarney**: I mean, at the end of the day, when I talked to, to Annie last week, Jason, I was like, she seemed to.
**Jbarney**: To be on it with the, with the landlord, with David, and, and I'm happy here.
**Jbarney**: If we don't hear anything in the next day or so, like, I'll, I'll start bugging him.
**Jbarney**: I'm.
**Jbarney**: I'm sometimes pretty good at that.
**Jbarney**: So.
**Whall**: Yeah, well, and I told him like he had privately emailed us too and said he needs reimbursement or needs us to commit to reimbursement for their legal fees for dealing with this.
**Whall**: And then like, that they need to rewrite the lease so that the property definition is adjusted.
**Whall**: And I don't know if they'll even make us pay for the, the part of the property, but it's like, I, I don't know if we did something wrong here earlier in the process and should have known that this was going to be a big issue.
**Whall**: That's probably the case.
**Whall**: But also like, we, our use variance was part of our agreement with them right at the beginning, more than three years, like three years ago.
**Whall**: So I did not anticipate this stalling us in this way.
**Whall**: And so I'm working hard to call, make sure that we do what we need here.
**Jbarney**: So I, I don't think you guys did anything wrong.
**Jbarney**: I mean, this should, should.
**Jbarney**: And it sounds like it was all laid out already in your lease agreement.
**Jbarney**: So it sounds like they're just being difficult to be honest with you when, when it comes to this, because there's nothing.
**Jbarney**: I mean, if they knew, they're.
**Whall**: Yeah, we've known for a while.
**Jbarney**: We have to put this path in and, and now that it's here, they're, they're just, I mean, it's, it's not going to be too far.
**Jbarney**: They're not losing hardly any property.
**Jbarney**: I don't know.
**Whall**: Okay.
**Smackay**: Yeah.
**Smackay**: And again, as far as the documents go, those that, the grant of right away dedication, that's all a standard city of Carmel form that was not created by us.
**Smackay**: We created the property description and legal description and did those surveys.
**Smackay**: But as far as the actual dedication document, that's the standard city of Carmel document.
**Smackay**: So it wasn't anything that brought.
**Smackay**: Yeah, it's just typical.
**Smackay**: And that's for like the, the responses to them the other day.
**Smackay**: I mean, this is any land that develops.
**Smackay**: So if they would have developed their land further in any way, you have to dedicate out the thoroughfare right away.
**Smackay**: It's not a eminent domain.
**Smackay**: The city doesn't buy that right away from you when you're developing your land.
**Smackay**: Now if the project has a.
**Smackay**: If the city has a project planned and you don't have any development of your land planned and they get there first to build a project they need right away, then they'll buy it from you.
**Smackay**: But to develop land and in this case the special use that you guys got that, that granted dedication right away was a condition on it.
**Smackay**: And that's very typical with every project.
**Smackay**: So it's not anything they would have done on their property to improve it.
**Smackay**: Would have had the same exact right of way dedication.
**Whall**: Yeah.
**Whall**: Okay.
**Whall**: And he said something about in one of the emails around exhibit A and B being blank, like did we resolve that issue with him?
**Smackay**: He might have had something bad or something.
**Smackay**: But I think even Anne had said that she found the, the good copy or in an email or something.
**Smackay**: But I can forward the, the two different exhibits.
**Smackay**: I, I think what he's referring to is just the a plat and a description for the rideway itself.
**Jbarney**: Okay.
**Whall**: And do you know, was that resolved with channel?
**Whall**: Can you hear me?
**Whall**: Are you on?
**Whall**: It seems like you're here, but.
**Whall**: All right.
**Jbarney**: Maybe, but.
**Smackay**: And it looked like.
**Smackay**: What's his name?
**Smackay**: David.
**Whall**: David Chichannowitz.
**Smackay**: Thank you for taking the stab at the name because I think he responded that he had everything he needed.
**Jbarney**: Yeah, I saw, I saw that.
**Jbarney**: They're just, seems like they're just, you.
**Whall**: Know, he said in his email 9:30 instead that he was checking with the landlord's attorney for 9:30 tomorrow and that he would respond.
**Whall**: We can schedule a call, discuss further without them.
**Jbarney**: Yeah, I wanted to make sure that, you know, the Coramdale team was the least on this so we could all just put our heads together and make sure that we're tracking in the right area.
**Jbarney**: And sounds like once we get through this landlord portion we get that signed document which if they have everything we need, we just need to be diligent about following up and then, you know, this is going to take a week to do so.
**Jbarney**: But it's July now and then next week is pretty shot.
**Whall**: Right.
**Jbarney**: Because of the short week.
**Jbarney**: So it's looking now like we wouldn't be able to start until the week after July 4th.
**Jbarney**: And then it's like on a couple days, you know, a couple weeks.
**Jbarney**: So it is starting to get up against it.
**Smackay**: Yeah, we, you know, what we would ask for is once we have that, you know, signed and back to the city and they say that's fine.
**Smackay**: We, we'll get it scheduled to get signed or whatever.
**Smackay**: You know, we would ask at least for like a few days just to make sure we can get a survey crew freed up to get up there to stakey right away and all that.
**Jbarney**: Right, right.
**Whall**: Okay.
**Jbarney**: Okay.
**Whall**: Well, yeah, I'm looking at channel's correspondence right now and it looks like he's talking about having a call at 9:30 rather than 9.
**Smackay**: So.
**Whall**: You know, I, why don't I just take this forward with him?
**Whall**: I think we've got from you guys everything we need.
**Whall**: They say his, his associate has like, his legal counsel has said they have the actual drawing with the legal description, but he hadn't had a chance to review it yet as of yesterday, late afternoon.
**Whall**: And he's clear with us about the cost to us now for the review deed and lease amendment and so we can deal with that and we'll get this to you guys as soon as we can.
**Whall**: Okay?
**Whall**: Does that sound good?
**Jbarney**: Yeah, that sounds great.
**Jbarney**: And obviously David can reach out to any of us with any questions, Jason.
**Jbarney**: And you know, obviously he's, he can only do so much, so we just need to.
**Whall**: Well, thanks for your guys's assurance too that like this happens all the time.
**Whall**: We make this, you know, so we'll get, we'll make sure we get that signature, signature to you guys as soon as possible, so.
**Whall**: All right.
**Whall**: And you got AJ you got baby duty.
**Whall**: AJ that's exciting.
**Jbarney**: I have one more meeting at 10 and then we're going to the hospital, I think.
**Whall**: Okay.
**Whall**: All right.
**Smackay**: That's a lot.
**Whall**: Well, we won't, yeah, we'll, we'll hear from you.
**Whall**: I guess on the flip side is, or should we reach out to somebody else in the meantime or.
**Jbarney**: I, I, I'm working, you know, I'll be working from home for the next, okay, two weeks, but I'm, I'm always available, obviously.
**Jbarney**: You know, there may be a four hour window or however long it takes, but.
**Whall**: Yeah, yeah, yeah, hey, whatever you need.
**Jbarney**: Yeah.
**Whall**: And then the internal work with your teams, like, is that moving forward too?
**Whall**: I know you said this week sometime.
**Jbarney**: Yep, I'm working on getting that.
**Jbarney**: So I'm waiting for my crew that, that we met with to finish up a job.
**Jbarney**: They're on.
**Jbarney**: And then you're next on the docket, Jason, so.
**Whall**: Okay.
**Jbarney**: I still owe you some paperwork for the signed change order, which isn't a huge deal.
**Jbarney**: I have an email, so we'll we'll get that signed and then like I said, it's only.
**Jbarney**: It's only going to take, you know, a week or two so that.
**Jbarney**: That won't be long either.
**Jbarney**: But.
**Jbarney**: But we're looking to at least start, get demo done and then we'll go from there.
**Whall**: Great.
