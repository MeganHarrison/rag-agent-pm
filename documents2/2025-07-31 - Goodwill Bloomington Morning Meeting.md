## Transcript
**Jcurtin**: No, no, there's nothing it will be affecting today.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Ksipe**: What all are you doing on site today, jdawson?
**Jcurtin**: Today, painters are continuing to tighten up paint.
**Jcurtin**: Flooring guys are blitzing base on the sales floor.
**Jcurtin**: Glenmark is installing some more chair rail and baseboard.
**Jcurtin**: They're also taping and mudding inside the donation vestibule.
**Jcurtin**: They're installing FRP in the janitor's closet.
**Jcurtin**: Fire sprinkler guys are coming to just drop two more heads in two of the rooms.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, those are the.
**Jcurtin**: Those are the main things going on today.
**Ksipe**: And what.
**Ksipe**: When are they working on the canopy area next?
**Jcurtin**: Who's.
**Jcurtin**: Who's they?
**Ksipe**: What is the next act activity you have there?
**Jcurtin**: Right now, it's concrete being poured there on Monday.
**Jcurtin**: That's the next one.
**Ksipe**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: And then once that cures, then framers will get up there.
**Jcurtin**: It'll take them a half day to hang the rest of the dens glass.
**Jcurtin**: And then, then we'll blitz it with EFIs.
**Jdawson**: I'm sorry, and I missed that first part.
**Jdawson**: Did you figure out the whole blocking thing on those.
**Jdawson**: The awnings?
**Jcurtin**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: Didn't sound very convincing.
**Ksipe**: There's just the.
**Ksipe**: Well, I. I guess I need to find out where the attachment is.
**Ksipe**: Like vertically on the awning, they have these clips that they.
**Ksipe**: They're gonna.
**Ksipe**: So there's the beam, and then above the beam, it's just studs.
**Ksipe**: There's studs and dense glass.
**Jcurtin**: Or there's dense glass on the, on the front side of the.
**Jcurtin**: Of the studs.
**Ksipe**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Well, that's not enough to attach it to unless it magically lands on a stud.
**Ksipe**: Okay, so you think we.
**Ksipe**: We should definitely put block in, Jesse?
**Jdawson**: Well, yeah, I mean, they.
**Jdawson**: Maybe they can slide it in from the back side when they're framing it.
**Jdawson**: You know, once they cut that opening.
**Jdawson**: I don't know.
**Jdawson**: But you're gonna have to have something in there, minimum, like three quarter plywood.
**Jcurtin**: Don't.
**Ksipe**: Yeah, we're.
**Ksipe**: We're gonna have to cut.
**Ksipe**: Cut that drywall then and install the blocking jack.
**Ksipe**: But yeah, I'll have to get pricing from Glenmark for that.
**Jcurtin**: For sure.
**Jcurtin**: For sure.
**Jcurtin**: Another thing that they're gonna.
**Jcurtin**: We may have to get some pricing on.
**Jdawson**: We laid out, we're framing this supposedly today.
**Jdawson**: So if they start framing it all and then they got to try to add blocking later, now we got to rip everything off from the front side.
**Jdawson**: Instead of sliding down, you know, plywood, they, you know, they pre.
**Jdawson**: Make it even to go in between stud spacings where it's notched on one side so it fits into the.
**Ksipe**: Oh, okay.
**Ksipe**: So, yeah, framing.
**Ksipe**: I see what you're saying.
**Jdawson**: You know, then you can slide it right down the wall for it to put the track on and, and, and just screw through the front to attach it or back through the sides.
**Jdawson**: But, I mean, they'll know how to do that.
**Jdawson**: But you can't be waiting around to figure that out or else.
**Jdawson**: You mean ripping the.
**Jdawson**: You'll have to take all the alleatogroup off the front.
**Jcurtin**: No.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, we don't want to do that now.
**Jcurtin**: I mean, Griffin.
**Jcurtin**: Griffin knows, like, the conversation about blocking.
**Jcurtin**: So, like, there's definitely.
**Jcurtin**: We were not.
**Jcurtin**: There's no way we'll.
**Jcurtin**: We'll miss that out here as far as getting the studs in and then going, oh, no, we didn't put any blocking.
**Jdawson**: But we're.
**Jdawson**: We're day of framing.
**Jdawson**: We have nothing planned for it.
**Jdawson**: So all I'm saying is day, get with the awning people, find out where these things are going to attach, what's the height, and then make sure, like, they're gonna have to get the plywood, like, just be urgent about getting all that lined up this morning before they get started and.
**Jdawson**: And settle.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: And we.
**Jcurtin**: We actually have one.
**Jcurtin**: They're not.
**Jcurtin**: They're not framing until tomorrow.
**Jcurtin**: So today was actually.
**Jcurtin**: This morning we actually got a little small wiggle room to be urgent and get this.
**Jcurtin**: Get ahead of this.
**Ksipe**: If we're doing plywood, then there's only on top of the beam, there's five inches that we have to attach the awning.
**Ksipe**: So I don't think we need to know the height of the clips for the plywood because we're just going to have to put plywood up to where we frame the window opening, which is I. I think like 7 inches between the beam and the window opening.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: So they can use the.
**Ksipe**: I'll send an email to Glenmark explaining it.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: Would you.
**Jcurtin**: Would you mind also putting in there a reminder?
**Jcurtin**: Greg hasn't got back with me yet, but his foreman, Griffin, told me that their price to install the donation Dropbox was not included, including demo of any cmu.
**Jcurtin**: So.
**Ksipe**: Him to send us another change order then.
**Ksipe**: Yeah.
**Ksipe**: Which I asked him if I had everything to install, and he said yes, but I guess he didn't think about that.
**Jcurtin**: Oh.
**Ksipe**: I'll send him an email asking for a price on that.
**Ksipe**: And also that photo you sent me yesterday on team check.
**Ksipe**: I don't.
**Ksipe**: It didn't come through.
**Ksipe**: Okay.
**Ksipe**: Not now.
**Ksipe**: It came through yesterday.
**Ksipe**: It wasn't Is there anything else you need on site, Jack?
**Jcurtin**: Nope.
**Jdawson**: How's.
**Jdawson**: So is everything lined up for the block?
**Jdawson**: Mason?
**Jdawson**: He's good to go this weekend?
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: Yep, he's good to go.
**Jcurtin**: He got the.
**Jcurtin**: He got Nick's email, so he's ready to rock and roll this weekend.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: But just keep doing everything you can to get that pushed on.
**Jdawson**: We just got two more projects from Goodwill in Indiana, so just need to make them happy.
**Jcurtin**: Amen.
**Jcurtin**: What kind of projects are those?
**Jdawson**: Adding canopies to two of their locations.
**Jcurtin**: Right on.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, like I said, they'll have a full crew this weekend, and then they'll go down to a small crew Monday and Tuesday, and then if everything holds up on what they expect, they expect to finish this other project on Wednesday, and then they'll be able to man it back with a full crew come Thursday, and then blitz it Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and hopefully finish by Sunday, the 10th.
**Jcurtin**: If they got to work some extra hours during the week to kind of give us rather be ahead than trying to play safe, they're prepared to do that too.
**Ksipe**: All right.
**Ksipe**: Is that it?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: That's all.
**Jcurtin**: That's all I got.
**Ksipe**: Okay, I'll talk to you guys later.
**Ksipe**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: See ya.
**Jcurtin**: Thanks, Joe.
