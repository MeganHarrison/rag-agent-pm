## Transcript
**Bclymer**: I was thinking more draw.
**Bclymer**: I got them on my dick because it murdered.
**Bclymer**: I hope Firefly didn't catch that.
**Bclymer**: It may have, but it's an internal.
**Bclymer**: Doesn't matter.
**Bclymer**: This says no mic connected.
**Bclymer**: Just using True.
**Ataylor**: You're muted.
**Ataylor**: Aj.
**Bclymer**: He sits right next to me.
**Bclymer**: We don't have.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Feedback.
**Ataylor**: That works.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so Ulta, Fresno.
**Bclymer**: We were just talking about coverage.
**Bclymer**: Right now we have four H vac guys taking a look at it, and other than that, our pain points are finding an electrician structural.
**Bclymer**: We're gonna have to give an allowance just because we don't know the structure of the building.
**Bclymer**: We don't know how many we need to add, but we'll be able to back in.
**Bclymer**: I have Homestead look said that they can give me a general idea of what they're thinking.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: We're not going to take them all the way out there.
**Bclymer**: That's what they.
**Bclymer**: That's all they do is travel.
**Bclymer**: Brandon, do you know anything about the law they passed a year ago yesterday out there for climate control with OSHA?
**Bclymer**: So 23rd of July last year, they put a law into effect requiring all people to condition interior workspaces to 80 degrees or less.
**Bclymer**: So that's choke slamming all those contractors out there because it's been a bitch to try to get anybody to even agree to look at it.
**Ataylor**: Oh, I see.
**Bclymer**: So I think that's what they're running into is their years up because it looked like they have to do some kind of annual reporting on the climate in their buildings, and they're probably getting caught.
**Bclymer**: Have you gotten any feedback from Walter on, like, why they're pushing for this?
**Bclymer**: It's got to be that reason, right?
**Ataylor**: No, I didn't.
**Ataylor**: I didn't ask.
**Ataylor**: He just said that he goes, I want you to do the same thing you did for me in Greenwood in Fresno.
**Bclymer**: Oh, so you did this for him in Greenwood?
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: How many units do you remember you added?
**Ataylor**: I don't know.
**Ataylor**: I mean, maybe 30 or so, but I mean, it's a.
**Ataylor**: It's.
**Ataylor**: It's a different size building, different climate.
**Ataylor**: You know, you can't.
**Ataylor**: You can't go apples to apples, right?
**Bclymer**: Well, based off of my math, I did, you know, and I was talking with this Steve guy who.
**Bclymer**: They're based out of Fresno.
**Bclymer**: You know, we're looking at needing like 1700 tons of cooling.
**Bclymer**: Approximately 630, 000 square foot divided by 3 50th a ton gets to.
**Ataylor**: Is that just office or is that.
**Bclymer**: That's just warehouse.
**Ataylor**: All right, that's What?
**Ataylor**: I mean, it's just the warehouse.
**Bclymer**: 630, 123 divided by 350, 1800 minus what they have existing, which is 250 tons.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, 1500 tons is what we need.
**Bclymer**: That's weight.
**Bclymer**: That comes out to be like 50 units.
**Ataylor**: So the square footage, what's the total square footage of the building?
**Bclymer**: 670,000.
**Ataylor**: And the warehouse is how much of that?
**Bclymer**: 630,000.
**Ataylor**: Do you know the deck height?
**Bclymer**: I didn't look at it, but.
**Bclymer**: Are you trying to factor in volume?
**Ataylor**: Yeah, that's it.
**Ataylor**: You have to.
**Bclymer**: I don't know the calculation because you.
**Ataylor**: Gotta think if you had 630 square footage and the roof was 5 foot, then that's a lot less space than if it's 40, right?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Like what we were doing at Memphis.
**Bclymer**: That's why we were putting in that ceiling.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, but we can't do that there, right?
**Bclymer**: I'll look at the drawings here, tell you shortly.
**Bclymer**: Has Walter given you any idea of a budget?
**Ataylor**: No.
**Bclymer**: So we're just shooting.
**Bclymer**: He.
**Ataylor**: He has no idea what the.
**Ataylor**: What?
**Ataylor**: You know, he has no idea.
**Bclymer**: One second.
**Bclymer**: Benny wants pricing Tuesday.
**Ataylor**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So worst case, if we got it.
**Bclymer**: Sorry, go ahead.
**Bclymer**: These joists look to be anywhere from.
**Ataylor**: You should see something that says bod.
**Bclymer**: What'd you say?
**Ataylor**: You should see something that says like bod.
**Ataylor**: Bottom of deck or something like that on the structural drawings.
**Bclymer**: I'm just looking at, I'm just looking at the, the architectural cross section right now.
**Bclymer**: 4 foot 5 inches.
**Ataylor**: It seems very short.
**Bclymer**: 34 foot.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I mean I'm looking right here.
**Bclymer**: It says.
**Bclymer**: Sure, 34 foot 5 inches.
**Ataylor**: Okay, 34 foot minus 10 inches here.
**Bclymer**: To get to the bottom of the deck.
**Bclymer**: So that's pretty standard, isn't it?
**Bclymer**: I haven't built what standard?
**Bclymer**: About 35 foot deck height.
**Ataylor**: No, that's not, that's, that's.
**Ataylor**: That's why I was saying that's odd.
**Ataylor**: That's not a, a standard height.
**Bclymer**: What's standard?
**Bclymer**: Usually 35 foot clear.
**Ataylor**: 36 foot clear would be something I would say is, is standard because the way that they, you design these buildings is like based off of rack heights.
**Ataylor**: Right.
**Ataylor**: You know, and how high you can stack a rack.
**Ataylor**: So 40 foot, 40 foot deck puts you in a different sprinkler class.
**Ataylor**: Now you have to use a bigger head.
**Ataylor**: So you, you usually will try to stay under that.
**Ataylor**: And so if you do like a 36 foot clear, that, that's like typically will get you right close to that.
**Ataylor**: Go back to that cross section.
**Bclymer**: I mean, they have 40 foot to the top of the parachute, Right?
**Ataylor**: Go to the Zoom out.
**Ataylor**: Go to the elevation.
**Bclymer**: With the elevation of the building.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, to the left.
**Ataylor**: Right there.
**Ataylor**: Yep.
**Ataylor**: Should be up right there.
**Ataylor**: You passed it.
**Bclymer**: Did I pass it?
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: There you go.
**Ataylor**: All right.
**Ataylor**: Just zoom in on one of those.
**Bclymer**: 34 foot 5 inches.
**Ataylor**: Zoom out.
**Ataylor**: Go to the bottom one.
**Ataylor**: That's the dock.
**Ataylor**: You want to go to the front.
**Ataylor**: That is a cross dock building.
**Ataylor**: Go to the top one.
**Bclymer**: It is cross dock building.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: All right.
**Ataylor**: So 34 foot five.
**Ataylor**: So their girts must be five foot.
**Ataylor**: And that's why.
**Ataylor**: So that puts their deck at 39.
**Ataylor**: It's because it smokes.
**Bclymer**: I didn't see looking at the structural here.
**Bclymer**: Well, either way, I don't know what.
**Ataylor**: That's fine.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, that's fine.
**Ataylor**: That.
**Ataylor**: That again, that's enough.
**Ataylor**: I 30, you know, 34 and a half, you know.
**Bclymer**: So here's, here's what me and Jesse plan on doing.
**Bclymer**: I'm going to knock out the clarifications and the estimates so we can plug and chug.
**Bclymer**: And then it's just calling on people today.
**Bclymer**: So I gave them till Monday on Plan Hub, Monday at noon Pacific time to get us numbers.
**Bclymer**: That gives us all day Monday, Monday evening, and then Tuesday to put a budget together with some allowances if we have to and send that off to Walter enough to be close.
**Ataylor**: If.
**Ataylor**: So if, if the case is that there's just so many people out there, like, they just don't want to do it.
**Ataylor**: Like, is that essentially what you're running into?
**Ataylor**: Or like, what about these guys that you.
**Ataylor**: That said they are going to put a number on it?
**Bclymer**: One of them is out of state, but close.
**Ataylor**: The other two are local.
**Bclymer**: But yeah, everybody out there is saying it's too big for them to get involved right now because they're too busy.
**Bclymer**: I don't think anyone wants to allocate resources to something this big with all the small projects they're probably having to appease with this law.
**Bclymer**: I mean, Brandon, it's your typical.
**Bclymer**: What we always run into, you know, we're, you know, if we could tell Walter we'll get him something into next week or that maybe, you know, gives us more time.
**Bclymer**: But right now, like, I'm.
**Bclymer**: I'm obviously comfortable with me and Jesse being able to put a budget together.
**Bclymer**: No doubt.
**Bclymer**: But there's, there's some unknowns, especially with that I've had two guys ask for a site visit and you can't do that.
**Bclymer**: We can't set up a site visit, so.
**Bclymer**: But we, we have good coverage H vac as of now.
**Bclymer**: Now it's just a matter of getting electrical.
**Bclymer**: I have, I have a roofer looking at it.
**Bclymer**: Is it just a matter of getting out there for a site visit or.
**Ataylor**: Will they not let us in?
**Bclymer**: Well, Ulta, like Ulta is so strict on security.
**Bclymer**: One of us needs to be there.
**Bclymer**: Well, I can be.
**Bclymer**: Well, I know you can be, but on.
**Ataylor**: It's the thing is like last thing I want to do, you know, in is fly out there, meet with, you know, one or two guys and.
**Ataylor**: And they can't get us a number, you know.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, like this is a complete waste of time.
**Bclymer**: Waste of time.
**Bclymer**: But that's where we're at.
**Bclymer**: So we're gonna keep pounding the phones, try to find an electrical to guy, but right now I like, I have no, the, the one dude I spoke to, they have engineering in house, so I'm going to talk with them today.
**Bclymer**: But I just have no idea.
**Bclymer**: Like we're looking at, you know, 50 units right now.
**Bclymer**: 25 tons.
**Bclymer**: 25 ton units.
**Bclymer**: But to me, like, we're gonna have to add a whole new roof if we put that much weight on there, right?
**Ataylor**: No.
**Bclymer**: What do you think?
**Ataylor**: No, I mean you wouldn't have to add a new, you know, new, new structure.
**Bclymer**: I'm just thinking of what I did in Dallas.
**Bclymer**: We had to, you know, we were going so far as to trying to bring Joyce in the building.
**Bclymer**: It's like trying to bring a 50 foot joist in there.
**Bclymer**: You're almost gonna have to build it inside.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: I mean like the thing is like what, what you do is like, like so they've got a ton of fans and stuff in there.
**Ataylor**: And so what you.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, what you want to do is like when you get these units, what you do is you set them to where like the one of the long size is on a girt.
**Ataylor**: You know, you just line those girts and you should be able to.
**Ataylor**: To make it work.
**Ataylor**: Maybe we gotta do something.
**Bclymer**: We're just gonna do them and we're just going to do a bunch of just four way diffusers.
**Ataylor**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Blown goes correct.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: No ducting.
**Bclymer**: Well, we have enough to be dangerous right now.
**Bclymer**: We just got to find an electrical guy and get an idea of how many units we need to install.
**Ataylor**: And you're thinking from there, I mean you're thinking how many AJ I'm thinking.
**Bclymer**: 25 times.
**Bclymer**: I think the math came out to 42 or 47.
**Bclymer**: 1500 tons is what we're needing 20, 25 ton units.
**Bclymer**: It's 62 of them and they cost us from train 35,000.
**Bclymer**: A UN looking at $2 million in units alone.
**Ataylor**: I mean, that doesn't stop that math.
**Bclymer**: Now I'm probably wrong, but still.
**Ataylor**: Did you take into account the existing RTUs in your math?
**Bclymer**: I did, yeah.
**Bclymer**: I went to the equipment page and I counted up all the tonnage they have there.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So I mean we're at 2 million in units plus call it another million in install.
**Bclymer**: Right?
**Bclymer**: That's us buying the units.
**Bclymer**: That's your blow and goes and a company to install it.
**Bclymer**: Plus probably having to bring in a new server.
**Bclymer**: I mean this is a $5 million project all day.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, I mean it doesn't shock me.
**Ataylor**: So.
**Ataylor**: So let's follow up with those companies that did say they're getting US numbers and confirmed that they are getting US numbers.
**Ataylor**: You know, and then.
**Ataylor**: So electrical is where we're missing people at.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, that's what we're going to focus on today.
**Ataylor**: So why don't you call Brennan because they're licensed in California.
**Bclymer**: Are they?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, that's who I was.
**Bclymer**: Brennan is with team.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I had mentioned yesterday.
**Bclymer**: Okay, I'll call Brennan.
**Ataylor**: Yep.
**Ataylor**: So call him and see if it's something they're interested in looking at for us.
**Ataylor**: And then, you know, don't forget, obviously, fire alarm, right?
**Ataylor**: You gotta, you gotta tie, tie all your, all those units in.
**Ataylor**: So we'll have a fire alarm number.
**Bclymer**: Roofing number, structural, and we're gonna have to put a sprinkler head under each unit.
**Ataylor**: Yep.
**Ataylor**: Right.
**Ataylor**: Not necessarily.
**Ataylor**: It depends on where the lines line up.
**Ataylor**: Right.
**Ataylor**: Because I mean that cascades out, you know, 10ft or so.
**Ataylor**: So as long as the unit is not obstructing, like if there's a line right next to it, then yes.
**Ataylor**: So I mean you'll have an allowance for sprinkler, but it's not a guarantee that every single one's going to have to have a head underneath it.
**Bclymer**: Do you think it's smart to move forward with, with the thought of adding 50 units?
**Ataylor**: Well, I mean, I'm gonna double check your calcs and see what I come out to.
**Ataylor**: I mean, I would say like when you call those guys that said they're giving us numbers, ask them how many units they're thinking we need.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: Get their opinion.
**Bclymer**: I should have an update on that this afternoon.
**Bclymer**: I just talked to him at some point.
**Bclymer**: 7:00 clock last night and one of them this morning.
**Bclymer**: Okay, I'll call Bren and.
**Bclymer**: And have Dean give us a.
**Bclymer**: A budget number.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, yeah.
**Ataylor**: He's going to ask how many units there are, so.
**Ataylor**: But at least get him big.
**Bclymer**: 50 gives it.
**Bclymer**: If he can give me a per unit number.
**Bclymer**: Well, just tell me what it cost to bring.
**Bclymer**: We got to bring it into service potentially, though, so.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, yeah, tell them it.
**Ataylor**: If you tell them it's 50 units.
**Ataylor**: Right.
**Ataylor**: You know, as a ballpark.
**Ataylor**: And then, you know, have them based off of that.
**Ataylor**: And then, you know, that way, because we got to do the calculation to see how much power is there and what do we got to bring in.
**Bclymer**: How many.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: How many amps we need and all that.
**Ataylor**: Yep.
**Ataylor**: Cool.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: All right.
**Ataylor**: Thanks.
**Bclymer**: Thank you.
**Bclymer**: Dam.
