## Transcript
**Ataylor**: Hey, guys.
**Ataylor**: How's everybody doing?
**Blake.schneider**: Good, thanks.
**Blake.schneider**: How are you?
**Blake.schneider**: Oh, good.
**Ataylor**: Hey, Joanna.
**Ataylor**: We're still waiting on the permit, but we did get comments back and responded to them.
**Ataylor**: So we should have it by the end of this week.
**Ataylor**: That's.
**Ataylor**: That's the plan.
**Ataylor**: That's the goal.
**Ataylor**: I already told Tim about it.
**Ataylor**: He knows.
**Ataylor**: Blake, what do you need?
**Blake.schneider**: We'll need, obviously, once you guys get the permit, then we'll have like, we'll have the project number we need for state submittal.
**Blake.schneider**: We've already got draw.
**Blake.schneider**: We've already got drawing, and I've got the application started.
**Blake.schneider**: I'll send that over to you in advance just so you can have it ready when the owner needs to fill out some information.
**Blake.schneider**: And then other than that, just the green light to obviously an opening to get a lift in there and then green light to go.
**Ataylor**: So on Monday, I had the steel for the doors installed and I have my concrete cutter lined up ready to jump as soon as I give them the go once we get the permit.
**Ataylor**: So as of now, like, AJ's telling me that we should have it by the end of this week.
**Ataylor**: So I've got him kind of on schedule to start cutting on Monday.
**Ataylor**: So that's when I want to get the lifts in there.
**Ataylor**: And I'll have a temporary door installed on the front entrance.
**Ataylor**: I mean, we tried getting a lift in through the door that is existing, but you can't even turn into it because of how small that hallway is.
**Blake.schneider**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: I mean, we were able to get like a little tiny one in there, but that won't reach up to the ceiling where you need to go.
**Blake.schneider**: Right.
**Ataylor**: My H VAC guy, Mike, he's ready to go.
**Ataylor**: Structural steel guy.
**Ataylor**: As soon.
**Ataylor**: As soon as we get that opening in, he's going to get a forklift in there so he can get the window frames up and then he'll do the RTU steel.
**Ataylor**: Got the roofers going, so I mean, we're kind of ahead on the electrical portion, so kind of really just waiting on this permit and everybody should be good to go.
**Ataylor**: Joanna, are you needing anything else?
**Ataylor**: And you're kind of just been on standby too.
**Brianj**: Yes.
**Brianj**: Hi, Alex.
**Jdawson**: The only things I know, we sent RFIs over, so I think we're still waiting on some answers, which I had them pulled up now.
**Jdawson**: I can't find them.
**Ataylor**: The data tie in location.
**Ataylor**: I know.
**Brianj**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Coordinating the shutdown submittals back on fire alarm and controls.
**Ataylor**: I think.
**Jdawson**: Oh, and then a scope.
**Jdawson**: Oh, sorry.
**Jdawson**: And then a scope sheet from the FedEx electricians.
**Ataylor**: AJ you there?
**Ataylor**: You're on me, brother.
**Pdavid**: Yeah, I was buzzing in security here.
**Pdavid**: What's going.
**Pdavid**: What's going on guys?
**Pdavid**: So.
**Pdavid**: So, hey, I just wanted to pop in.
**Pdavid**: We're expected to get a permit here.
**Pdavid**: So Alex is adjusting the schedule, guys.
**Pdavid**: And we can start actually moving forward on some of these things.
**Pdavid**: Okay.
**Pdavid**: So it'll start being a priority here in the next coming days.
**Pdavid**: Joanna, I have no idea on a tie in location for data.
**Pdavid**: And I also as far as the fire alarm goes, I'll take a peek.
**Pdavid**: And then you have the FedEx scope.
**Pdavid**: If you look at the drawings, which is the FedEx drawing that we all have.
**Pdavid**: All we're doing is providing boxes for them to tie into in the wall or above the ceiling.
**Pdavid**: And then from there our scope is done.
**Pdavid**: So wherever it shows a junction box on that drawing, I would say that's where we stop.
**Pdavid**: Does that make sense?
**Ataylor**: What are they going to do for this equipment that's out in the open?
**Ataylor**: AJ Are they going to have like a power pole?
**Ataylor**: Yeah, I mean junction, above grid.
**Ataylor**: Like I was wondering.
**Pdavid**: The drawings call for a power pole, I believe.
**Pdavid**: But our scope is providing junction boxes.
**Pdavid**: How they get to it?
**Pdavid**: You know, obviously as the time comes, once we get the ceiling in, we'll.
**Pdavid**: We'll do something for them.
**Pdavid**: I know that that ceiling is at what like 12 foot.
**Pdavid**: And our actual ceiling above is at 25 foot, I think to deck.
**Pdavid**: So we'll have to come up with some way to put a junction box in the ceiling.
**Pdavid**: And if we mount it to the grid or piece of all thread or what we do.
**Ataylor**: Joanna, how would you do that?
**Brianj**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: I'm gonna get with.
**Jdawson**: With Pavel and Tim and then we'll.
**Jdawson**: We'll come up with a game plan.
**Pdavid**: Yeah, unfortunately like FedEx hasn't given me much, much information.
**Pdavid**: Joanna.
**Pdavid**: I'm sure as the time, as it gets closer, they will.
**Pdavid**: But you know, eventually, once we define that I was talking with Pavel the other day, then we'll figure out what the credit is on your guys end.
**Pdavid**: I know a couple things will probably come up.
**Pdavid**: So we just need to make sure we don't forget to settle up.
**Pdavid**: I know.
**Pdavid**: I won't forget to settle up here.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Pdavid**: Later in the job.
**Jdawson**: That sounds like a plan.
**Ataylor**: Then.
**Ataylor**: AJ for your information, I talked to Mike, I talked to Rafael, I talked to Mike Spalding.
**Ataylor**: Well his guy that's installing D st.
**Ataylor**: So.
**Ataylor**: And all those guys are just waiting on the green light.
**Pdavid**: Sweet.
**Pdavid**: And here moving forward.
**Pdavid**: Alex, we're gonna let's just make sure we keep these meetings, you know, short to time for everybody, diverse opinion and make.
**Pdavid**: Make sure we need to get Brian Jones in here.
**Ataylor**: And Brian.
**Ataylor**: But I've been talking with Matt.
**Ataylor**: I mean, Brian kind of is like stepping back.
**Ataylor**: Let Matt.
**Ataylor**: His kids run it.
**Pdavid**: So make sure that's on it.
**Ataylor**: Same page.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, he knows like as soon as I get the concrete cutter in there, he's got to be right behind him to frame in that front entrance and put a temporary door in.
**Ataylor**: So I've been in communication with them the whole time.
**Pdavid**: All right, well, I gotta pop off here, guys.
**Pdavid**: We'll be expecting some emails here in the next coming days and we'll send out a new schedule.
**Ataylor**: Okay?
**Ataylor**: Yeah, I'm going to be working on updating that, kind of adjusting it to basically start next Monday.
**Pdavid**: All right, see you guys.
**Brianj**: Thanks.
**Ataylor**: AJ do you have anything to add?
**Ataylor**: No, I'm good.
**Ataylor**: Thanks, everybody.
**Ataylor**: We'll see you.
**Brianj**: Thank you.
