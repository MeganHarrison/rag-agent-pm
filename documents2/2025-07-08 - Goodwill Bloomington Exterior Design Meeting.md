## Transcript
**Greulice**: That's the previous version right there.
**Amulder**: Yep.
**Greulice**: Okay.
**Amulder**: Hey, Eric.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: How'S it going?
**Greulice**: Hey, guys.
**Amulder**: Okay.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Jerome, do you want to go over your.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Your design?
**Amulder**: Sure.
**Greulice**: Yeah.
**Greulice**: I mean, basically, we're trying to get this as close back to the original location or the original condition, the numbers that we.
**Greulice**: That we can, while trying to still meet some of the design intent for the.
**Amulder**: For the.
**Greulice**: For Goodwill there.
**Greulice**: So the first thing.
**Greulice**: And then we're showing kind of some of the.
**Greulice**: The color, you know, the paint and the signage in here, the.
**Greulice**: The intent as well.
**Greulice**: So the biggest thing that we have on here is going back to really, all of the existing pre.
**Greulice**: Or the previous canopy exist, those conditions.
**Greulice**: So adding those canopies in, so they'd be kind of flanking the storefront there, adding in the canopies on the kind of the eastern side of the south elevation, adding those canopies in, and then adding in, sorry, the awnings.
**Greulice**: And then on the east elevation, doing.
**Greulice**: Doing the same, adding those back in where they used to be kind of a storefront.
**Greulice**: So we are proposing that we keep the CMU infill there, and that's really just to try to meet the intent.
**Amulder**: For Goodwill to have that as their.
**Greulice**: Back house and not have to add any additional walls there and keep that.
**Greulice**: Keep that really durable.
**Greulice**: But the intent is to take the storefront, the storefront square footage that we had before and then utilize that as transom.
**Greulice**: So we're getting good light into the.
**Greulice**: Into that backhouse space for them, but basically take that and replace that area up above there as transom.
**Jdawson**: So can you just, for my clarity, show me where those.
**Jdawson**: Put a cursor or something over where those transom windows would be.
**Jdawson**: I'm having a hard time reading things here.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Yeah, go ahead, Jerome.
**Greulice**: No, sorry, I forgot you had the.
**Greulice**: You had the cursor there.
**Amulder**: I've got it.
**Greulice**: I had it up on my screen earlier, but.
**Greulice**: You've got the cursor.
**Greulice**: Sorry.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Yeah, it's on.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: These are the transom windows, the higher up windows.
**Jdawson**: Oh, okay.
**Amulder**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So those are full size windows.
**Greulice**: Yes.
**Greulice**: Yeah.
**Greulice**: Really, the intent there.
**Greulice**: What we're trying to do is just meet that same square footage.
**Amulder**: Okay.
**Greulice**: Right now at the bottom of the awning was the top of the previous storefront system.
**Greulice**: That was six foot high there.
**Greulice**: So we're taking the one foot, which.
**Greulice**: There's.
**Greulice**: There's structure behind there, but going up that one foot, so we can avoid that structure and then build up and.
**Greulice**: Which is 8 foot, actually a storefront here.
**Greulice**: So between that, then between the eight foot.
**Greulice**: We're getting a little bit more space on the south side and really kind of really close on the east side to matching that previous amount of storefront glass.
**Jdawson**: Okay, that.
**Jdawson**: That looks like it meets.
**Jdawson**: Thank you guys very much for working on that so fast.
**Greulice**: Awesome.
**Greulice**: Thanks, Eric.
**Amulder**: Yeah, for sure, Eric.
**Amulder**: What do we do?
**Amulder**: We need to submit anything or what's the next step?
**Jdawson**: I imagine just check with the Monroe County Building department.
**Jdawson**: They'll want to have this final set of plans to put with the permit.
**Amulder**: Okay.
**Amulder**: And like, are you going to send us an email saying, hey, I approved, like, this method of meeting the intent?
**Jdawson**: More than likely.
**Jdawson**: Check.
**Jdawson**: Check with the building department and then will you just email me back if they will require you to amend.
**Jdawson**: Amend their permit or anything?
**Jdawson**: If not, I can certainly send you an email and include the building department that we approve these changes.
**Amulder**: That would be very great if you could do that for us.
**Amulder**: We appreciate it.
**Jdawson**: Yep, absolutely.
**Jdawson**: Just follow up with them and then let me know what they say if they need an amended certificate of zoning compliance, and we can do that.
**Amulder**: Okay.
**Amulder**: All right, that worked.
**Jdawson**: Excellent.
**Jdawson**: All right, well, thank you, gentlemen, very much.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Thanks.
**Jdawson**: All right, take care.
