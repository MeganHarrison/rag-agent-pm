## Transcript
**Bclymer**: Hi, guys.
**Ataylor**: Hey, Maria.
**Ataylor**: How we doing?
**Bclymer**: Good.
**Bclymer**: You mean to take your picture now, Jesse?
**Ataylor**: No, that background need a lot more filters than that.
**Bclymer**: One second, please.
**Bclymer**: Come here, baby.
**Bclymer**: Jesse, actually, like the other time that you were going through the comments and everything and I went after that because it actually gives me more time to check everything.
**Bclymer**: So I will, you know, like fireflies.
**Bclymer**: I will check it tonight after we're done with the meeting, and I will go one by one.
**Bclymer**: Actually was better for me that way because he understood more the projects and everything.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so we can do that.
**Bclymer**: You can, you know, like lean it and then I'll just go ahead and make sure that we are doing, you know, comments.
**Ataylor**: Okay, perfect.
**Ataylor**: Good deal.
**Ataylor**: See here?
**Ataylor**: It's not sticky.
**Ataylor**: All right, do we have everyone on here?
**Ataylor**: I think so.
**Ataylor**: I think Brandon's on a plane, so.
**Ataylor**: All right, we're good.
**Ataylor**: If we look at.
**Ataylor**: I'm sharing my screen for everybody, starting this radio freezer demo.
**Ataylor**: So that was a new project just came in today.
**Ataylor**: We got to get a price for them in a week.
**Ataylor**: So look through it, put the drawings together.
**Ataylor**: Andrew's going to find me some subs tomorrow and we'll get that sent out.
**Ataylor**: That is pretty, pretty cut and paste for what that.
**Ataylor**: Is this RND group.
**Ataylor**: Not sure who put this in there.
**Ataylor**: Aj.
**Njepson**: Yeah, I've been trying to go in and like, update mine as, like they come.
**Njepson**: Right.
**Njepson**: So there's R and D group is the second story that was sent to us in that same building as Applied Engineering.
**Njepson**: So I created a folder for it and created this for you.
**Njepson**: If you click the.
**Njepson**: Click the drop down.
**Njepson**: Jesse, the arrow next to.
**Njepson**: About this project.
**Ataylor**: In here.
**Ataylor**: Yep.
**Ataylor**: Open.
**Njepson**: Open the project and then right there about this project.
**Ataylor**: Oh, that's how it goes.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Wonder how that worked.
**Njepson**: I started sending that out this morning, so I got to get him something by the end of the week.
**Ataylor**: Jesus, this thing's too slow.
**Ataylor**: Okay, so you're sending out by the end of the week.
**Ataylor**: Got it?
**Njepson**: No, no, I.
**Njepson**: I started sending out this morning.
**Njepson**: I got to get him a price by the end of the week.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: All right, Great clips, Madison.
**Ataylor**: That's it.
**Njepson**: That's another one.
**Njepson**: I'm.
**Njepson**: It's about 1500 square foot in Wisconsin.
**Njepson**: So right now I'm working with the local broker and great clips architect to.
**Njepson**: To get it as built drawing put together.
**Ataylor**: Paradise aisle.
**Ataylor**: There's a lot of stuff that needs to be put in here to add it to that, but that's nothing in the near future that's going to happen.
**Ataylor**: Neiman Second tennis base.
**Ataylor**: Any updates on this?
**Njepson**: No.
**Ataylor**: They.
**Ataylor**: We're done with everything we got to do.
**Ataylor**: Pricing.
**Njepson**: Yep, I've sent them everything that they need.
**Njepson**: I spoke with Corey last week just to see where they were at and they haven't said anything.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: High Tech Indy.
**Ataylor**: Brandon's working on this one.
**Ataylor**: See the perfume storage estimates in progress.
**Ataylor**: It's not a Brandon.
**Ataylor**: Cheap PC.
**Ataylor**: Harrisburg.
**Ataylor**: That one's done.
**Ataylor**: See, the playing field's done.
**Ataylor**: Longhorn demo.
**Ataylor**: Heard anything from those guys?
**Njepson**: I spoke with him, but I'm.
**Njepson**: We sent him the, the.
**Njepson**: The budget and so I need to follow up with him this week and see how he wants me to proceed and how that went.
**Ataylor**: This revised demo, is that done?
**Njepson**: No, you could put in progress for that.
**Ataylor**: Okay, what are we trying to do?
**Njepson**: Well, after talking with him, I don't think we really need a revised demo price because it seems pretty spot on comparing it with the job they did in the past.
**Njepson**: But what, what really needs to happen is a conversation with Ashton and.
**Ataylor**: And.
**Njepson**: That hasn't happened yet.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Forum Dayo.
**Njepson**: Yeah, I didn't get to updating that one, so I sent them the updated pricing on both.
**Ataylor**: This pricing's done.
**Njepson**: M.
**Njepson**: Yeah, they were just looking for breakouts.
**Njepson**: So I'm.
**Njepson**: I'm meeting with the surveyor next week.
**Njepson**: If you click the.
**Njepson**: The drop down on updates underneath project tasks.
**Njepson**: Jesse, blue lettering.
**Njepson**: Yep.
**Njepson**: Right underneath the subheading Project task.
**Njepson**: You got it.
**Njepson**: That's where you can put 310.
**Ataylor**: This is where Maria can just talk.
**Ataylor**: She's going to look at the firefighter, type all this in.
**Ataylor**: Awesome.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: So meeting with the surveyor here this week at some point, assuming I don't have to go to Dallas on Thursday and then.
**Njepson**: Yeah, we'll wait.
**Njepson**: This job won't start until end of May and it'll be summer work.
**Ataylor**: Okay, great clips.
**Ataylor**: Sunset Plaza.
**Njepson**: I haven't even started on it.
**Ataylor**: Okay, Sunshine Plaza, we are in.
**Njepson**: So the, the estimates done for the landlord work, is this the same one?
**Njepson**: There's Sunshine and Sunset.
**Njepson**: I get them two mixed up.
**Njepson**: One second here.
**Ataylor**: This one was Sunshine.
**Ataylor**: First one was Sunshine.
**Njepson**: Just.
**Njepson**: He just emailed me.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: So Sunshine, the estimate is done.
**Ataylor**: So all these drawings you got.
**Njepson**: I haven't gotten the hard drawings, but they gave me a general layout that shows it and I was able to mark it up.
**Njepson**: I did find out that we don't have any GC license requirements in Springfield.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Njepson**: So they're just working through the lease agreement right now, but we will be doing the landlord work.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Bella Canvas, Maryland is done.
**Ataylor**: Yep.
**Ataylor**: Penicillo, New Jersey.
**Ataylor**: We got to finish that out.
**Ataylor**: Can and got a price today from the electrician.

**Ataylor**: And we'll have that done tomorrow morning.
**Ataylor**: Have the temp control room waiting for release.
**Ataylor**: Goodwill Heritage.
**Ataylor**: He's just looking for an update.
**Ataylor**: Haven't got one yet.
**Ataylor**: Monon Yard.
**Ataylor**: We just need to get into it.
**Ataylor**: East street white box.
**Ataylor**: Any updates on this, aj?
**Njepson**: Nope.
**Njepson**: They're think they're doing due diligence right now?
**Njepson**: I would think so.
**Njepson**: Probably close on the building here and who knows how it goes with these guys.
**Ataylor**: Stone Gate Orthodontist.
**Njepson**: They'll be closing on the land in 30 days.
**Njepson**: I did follow up with him, but just keep.
**Njepson**: Yeah, keep it as in progress.
**Ataylor**: So there'll be just.
**Ataylor**: The update is what.
**Njepson**: Continue to follow up and see how land purchase goes.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Restaurant build out, crate.
**Njepson**: Yep, I put updates in there for that.
**Njepson**: So started the hood install today.
**Njepson**: We're waiting on the CDR still, but we should be done this week with the hood installation and then we'll hook up all the gas and electric next week.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Goodwill Tremont.
**Ataylor**: So I still.
**Ataylor**: We just gotta get that set up.
**Ataylor**: And I gotta check with Brandon on the drawings for that.
**Ataylor**: The guy was supposed to update him so we can get that out for pricing and get that job going.
**Ataylor**: They finalized on the updates?
**Ataylor**: Maria, you can just put up there.
**Ataylor**: They.
**Ataylor**: They didn't want any more changes from the last plan than what they'd asked for.
**Ataylor**: So we should be able to finish the design up and get going.
**Ataylor**: Port Collective don't have anything to update on that one other than we did get add task here for design.
**Mcalcetero**: Are we using access for this one too, Jesse?
**Ataylor**: Civil access.
**Ataylor**: What do they do?
**Mcalcetero**: Our studio access, Our architects.
**Mcalcetero**: Are we using them for these other two or the rest of the Collective locations as well?
**Ataylor**: No.
**Ataylor**: All right, so we have a civil number.
**Ataylor**: That's it.
**Ataylor**: And we have Seminole Collective.
**Ataylor**: Seminole Collective went over there Saturday, looked to the site, took a bunch of photos.
**Ataylor**: So I need to upload all those photos.
**Ataylor**: We got pricing back on architectural, we got landscaping.
**Ataylor**: One number.
**Ataylor**: We're expecting another.
**Ataylor**: We had two civil numbers.
**Ataylor**: And then today I talked to a geotech company there and I'll send them the plans and they'll give us a price to go do the geo report for that project.
**Ataylor**: And also on the container sub, I sent them the Sparkman's Wharf photos and website to give them an idea.
**Ataylor**: They just want to know what look we're going for.
**Ataylor**: And then they can finish up giving us budgets for manufacturing the containers.
**Ataylor**: Got a structural engineer.
**Ataylor**: I need to add that to port.
**Ataylor**: Got two structural engineers looking at Seminole Collective.
**Ataylor**: I just need to follow up with them, get their pricing.
**Ataylor**: Flight engineering, office remodel.
**Ataylor**: So the designs in progress.
**Njepson**: Sorry.
**Ataylor**: We repriced.
**Ataylor**: You sent that out Saturday.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: A couple things need to change, though, like just add me to the assignee under job planner, because I think.
**Njepson**: I think Dylan marked that as done and it's not done.
**Njepson**: He has not put that in yet, that first one.
**Ataylor**: Well, he created a job in there or.
**Ataylor**: No, he didn't.
**Ataylor**: That was for the.
**Njepson**: That was for the theater.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: So that need needs to be updated, but we're.
**Njepson**: We're waiting.
**Njepson**: Yeah, I put an update right there and send them the ve items Friday afternoon.
**Njepson**: Their architect's been released, so we're just waiting to see which route they wanted to go, and then we can start buying it out.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Maria, when you're going through all these, if you wouldn't mind updating that assign column.
**Bclymer**: To you.
**Ataylor**: Well, no, taking out somebody for.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, makes sense.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: All right.
**Ataylor**: Anything else on that one?
**Ataylor**: You got the architect?
**Ataylor**: I don't know.
**Ataylor**: They.
**Ataylor**: Did they respond whether they were going to keep the cabinets or replace them in the break room?
**Njepson**: They haven't yet.
**Njepson**: I'm on it.
**Ataylor**: So if you can just put a note in there that the architect.
**Ataylor**: They received our.
**Ataylor**: And the owner received our pricing to reduce the scope.
**Ataylor**: And then she's asked them to pick whether they're going to replace the existing break room cabinets or not.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: All right.
**Ataylor**: Danville Theater.
**Njepson**: I put my name in there all.
**Njepson**: Yeah, I mean, this one's going to probably take a little bit of a back seat for now, but I'll stay on it when I can and deal with.
**Njepson**: Deal with the owner.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Neiman Holdings.
**Ataylor**: FedEx.
**Njepson**: Yeah, I started updating that.
**Njepson**: Just working through final design.
**Njepson**: I.
**Njepson**: I have it right now.
**Njepson**: I'm typing up an email showing the changes between the FedEx, the FedEx drawing we got and what we priced for him.
**Njepson**: So I will have that out the door before I leave today.
**Njepson**: Jesse.
**Ataylor**: Is that the only thing hold them up from signing a contract with us?
**Njepson**: Yes, I.
**Njepson**: I talked to Corey, so I got the pricing on like, Thursday.
**Njepson**: I just haven't pulled it together yet.
**Njepson**: I.
**Njepson**: I talked to Corey and let him know there was going to be an increase.
**Njepson**: And he.
**Njepson**: So he.
**Njepson**: He's aware of it.
**Njepson**: He Just needs to see how much they're gonna have FedEx pay for and how much they're gonna pay for.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Aspire St.
**Ataylor**: Lucy.
**Ataylor**: Nick, why do these tasks look different?
**Njepson**: Click on tasks not board to the right there.
**Njepson**: Click that.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: So this one is done.
**Ataylor**: Buyout.
**Ataylor**: Nick, you're done with buyout, aren't you?
**Gducharme**: They just need to sign the contracts.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Contract for the work to the owner.
**Ataylor**: I thought we sent them that.
**Ataylor**: No.
**Ataylor**: So do you have that ready?
**Gducharme**: No, I can work on that.
**Ataylor**: All right.
**Ataylor**: Shouldn't take a whole lot to get that out today or tomorrow morning.
**Ataylor**: All that's done.
**Ataylor**: When is this starting or scheduled to start next Monday.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Cormark, Georgia, Exotech leave.
**Ataylor**: Alex is down there right now.
**Ataylor**: That's in progress.
**Ataylor**: All right, Glenn, you're up.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, no, I've been using this as a list and is that.
**Mcalcetero**: Is that all right?
**Ataylor**: Yeah, that's perfect.
**Ataylor**: Is the LA Master pay app.
**Ataylor**: I thought it's done.
**Mcalcetero**: No, I can't.
**Mcalcetero**: I mean, I can go and manually approve it in their commitment, but if that.
**Mcalcetero**: If something changed, I have to go back it back out.
**Mcalcetero**: So I told them I'll.
**Mcalcetero**: I'll approve it as soon as they send me their contract so that I can advance it through the system as approved and then I can apply an invoice to it.
**Ataylor**: So the solar panels that are out in our lobby, is that what they're putting on this building or want to.
**Mcalcetero**: That's.
**Mcalcetero**: That's the example.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah.
**Mcalcetero**: I think based on our conversation last week, it was making sure somebody's going to own that transition.
**Ataylor**: How close to the panel ribs are they?
**Ataylor**: Not close to the metal panel that come with the building.
**Mcalcetero**: I think they want them to run all the way up to the ridge and not have.
**Ataylor**: I'm saying.
**Ataylor**: Have you got a.
**Ataylor**: A profile of their roof system and what it looks like?
**Ataylor**: Was that not in their submittal.
**Ataylor**: For the metal panels?
**Mcalcetero**: For the metal panels.
**Mcalcetero**: I have a profile for that, but not for this.
**Mcalcetero**: I don't have anything for the solar system.
**Mcalcetero**: I haven't the solar system.
**Ataylor**: But those samples in our lobby, if they're what they're going to provide, can we not compare that to the roof panels that came from Nick?
**Mcalcetero**: It's not.
**Mcalcetero**: It's not that we can.
**Mcalcetero**: It's just that I have nothing.
**Mcalcetero**: Nothing from the solar.
**Mcalcetero**: Solar stuff has been handed off to me from Brandon, essentially.
**Mcalcetero**: So I have.
**Mcalcetero**: I have had nothing to do with the solar panels yet at this time.
**Ataylor**: Find out what they gave us is what they could.
**Ataylor**: They're planning on Ruby sending or using if there's any options for the difference in width and then send it to Nick and say this is what their panel is.
**Ataylor**: Does that make it any easier or more difficult to make that transition?
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: All right.
**Ataylor**: The MEP design, that's ongoing owner contract.
**Ataylor**: Is that done or is Brandon still.
**Mcalcetero**: I'm not sure if he finished it on Friday or not.
**Mcalcetero**: He was working on that and I finished the owner billing for him to finish that.
**Mcalcetero**: Pricing on glazing.
**Mcalcetero**: You'll probably get that out.
**Mcalcetero**: I'm pricing back.
**Mcalcetero**: You can close that project signage.
**Ataylor**: That was.
**Mcalcetero**: Brandon was going to give me the OR vector file or whatever it's going to be for.
**Mcalcetero**: For his design whenever he chooses that.
**Mcalcetero**: We'll get some signs put up there.
**Mcalcetero**: TCP is not going to go.
**Mcalcetero**: That goes with our right away permit.
**Mcalcetero**: So it's just on there until it's ready.
**Mcalcetero**: So I don't forget revised platting.
**Mcalcetero**: That's.
**Mcalcetero**: That can probably be closed.
**Ataylor**: They're done with it.
**Mcalcetero**: I mean Ashton's gonna deal with it throughout.
**Mcalcetero**: They're not.
**Mcalcetero**: They're not using it to hold up the permit and we don't.
**Mcalcetero**: There's nothing we need to do about it.
**Ataylor**: So we're not going to be held up from that.
**Mcalcetero**: No.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Mcalcetero**: Utility loads.
**Mcalcetero**: We will finalize that after our kitchen coordination on here on Wednesday.
**Mcalcetero**: If you see the design dates, the tracking design dates, give us all of our design dates that are deliverables that you asked about.
**Ataylor**: If you make these down here into a to do list, you can check them off.
**Mcalcetero**: I was trying to figure out how to do that, but it wasn't just.
**Ataylor**: Be the art cdr then you just have to highlight one of the words instead of text.
**Ataylor**: You make it a to do list.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: And after you've done one, you just hit enter and it makes another one.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: All right, go back.
**Mcalcetero**: What else is going on?
**Mcalcetero**: Foundation plan.
**Mcalcetero**: We had a meeting with the concrete guys on Friday afternoon and the structural engineer to try and value engineer that concrete back down.
**Mcalcetero**: They said they would get us that by tomorrow.
**Mcalcetero**: Tomorrow we have our OAC and then Chad and I are on site at like 3:30 with Katie and maybe one of the other owners to lay out.
**Mcalcetero**: Lay out where the work is going to go and where they can start putting their porter potties and plan their speakers and fences and stuff like that for we're going to come and tear that out.
**Mcalcetero**: I did have a question we had on the plans to tear out that southern edge of the volleyball fence.
**Mcalcetero**: Then on the and now it says to remain on our.
**Mcalcetero**: Or actually our contract here.
**Mcalcetero**: Our clarification says it's to remain.
**Mcalcetero**: Are we removing that fence on the south side of the courts or not?
**Ataylor**: We don't want to.
**Ataylor**: No.
**Mcalcetero**: That's it for now.
**Mcalcetero**: We got some Lois.
**Mcalcetero**: And working through the contracts, we really have probably about three or four more subs to.
**Mcalcetero**: To get locked in for the rest.
**Ataylor**: Of the scope of work.
**Mcalcetero**: Otherwise, we need a couple mason numbers back.
**Mcalcetero**: Figure out our windows, our ethis.
**Mcalcetero**: And then one contractor's pretty much got the rest of the framing, drywall, painting, and all those finishes in there in their estimates.
**Mcalcetero**: I might need to find a tile guy if none of them are going to do it, but.
**Ataylor**: Okay, good.
**Ataylor**: So, Goodwill office curb cut.
**Ataylor**: Nick, I thought we emailed Sandy.
**Gducharme**: We did, like two weeks ago and told her.
**Gducharme**: We told her to respond to him, and she evidently didn't look at that.
**Ataylor**: Well, did you forward that to her?
**Ataylor**: I couldn't find what.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, forwarded to her.
**Ataylor**: It's like, sandy, we told you this two weeks ago.
**Ataylor**: Okay, so we're still waiting on that permit.
**Ataylor**: Siva Brandon said they're.
**Ataylor**: They should hear back from permitting pretty soon, so that can get started.
**Ataylor**: Think all these invoices are done.
**Ataylor**: All right, Nick, Goodwill, Bloomington.
**Gducharme**: Just waiting on the permit.
**Gducharme**: The utility department.
**Ataylor**: Superintendent is done.
**Ataylor**: It's going to be Jack moving the entry.
**Ataylor**: Nick, have you got all that pricing in?
**Gducharme**: I believe we have it just having submitted it to the owner.
**Ataylor**: Well, we got to look at it and see what it is.
**Ataylor**: And if it went a little over, we'll just have to use some contingency RF item with the canopy door.
**Gducharme**: I don't think I.
**Gducharme**: I would have to look if I got a response.
**Ataylor**: Anything else on that?
**Gducharme**: The fire sprinkler.
**Gducharme**: They're asking if they can move it up at Party City.
**Ataylor**: Who's they?
**Ataylor**: Goodwill.
**Ataylor**: We'll talk with Andrew about that tomorrow.
**Ataylor**: This request was made by the people that came to the site the other day.
**Ataylor**: Today came today.
**Ataylor**: From who?
**Gducharme**: Goodwill.
**Ataylor**: Okay, anything else on that?
**Ataylor**: Your subcontracts.
**Ataylor**: How many you got left?
**Gducharme**: Maybe 10.
**Ataylor**: Okay, what's your expected completion of those?
**Gducharme**: Probably two weeks.
**Ataylor**: And then we need.
**Ataylor**: We do.
**Ataylor**: We still have the revised.
**Ataylor**: So those drawings, what is this one?
**Ataylor**: That was done.
**Ataylor**: So we just.
**Ataylor**: We need to have an activity in here or a task for the final building set, and we need to get these done.
**Ataylor**: After we get the approval from the city, then we can add in everything that's happened since our permit set was issued.
**Ataylor**: We'll get that Set.
**Ataylor**: Done.
**Ataylor**: Anything else on there, Nick?
**Ataylor**: No.
**Ataylor**: All right.
**Ataylor**: Aspire Newport, Richie.
**Ataylor**: So, Nick, I need to give you that farther architect.
**Ataylor**: Were you copied on any of the emails?
**Ataylor**: You have the plan that Ronnie sent?
**Gducharme**: What plan?
**Ataylor**: So Ronnie sent us the plan for a life safety plan for a different project.
**Ataylor**: He did, And I talked to him about it and he said we could just use them instead of the Studio three.
**Ataylor**: Oh, I have that.
**Ataylor**: It's saved in the folder to that drawing, Nick, and it's got the architect's name on it.
**Ataylor**: We just need to contact them.
**Ataylor**: Maybe better I do that and I'll just call them up about that.
**Ataylor**: No, see, that's done.
**Ataylor**: Anything else on that, Nick?
**Ataylor**: And just so I don't forget, we need to have a meeting and maybe we'll go over it Wednesday morning.
**Ataylor**: But the whole job planner and the billing, how that works, we should be able to be sending.
**Ataylor**: I need to figure out if we're creating a.
**Ataylor**: A billing cycle for everyone at once.
**Ataylor**: I'm not sure how that system works or we got to individually go to a sub, invite them to bid for the draw.
**Ataylor**: But I did a couple of the subs billings for them on Newport Richie, and it's pretty easy.
**Ataylor**: And it's especially easy as long as we got their schedule of values broke out properly.
**Ataylor**: So I just want to go over that with everybody on Wednesday, so prep for that tomorrow.
**Mcalcetero**: All right.
**Ataylor**: Aj, are you on another call or are you still with us?
**Ataylor**: Oh, A.J.
**Ataylor**: goodwill.
**Ataylor**: BART Superintendent.
**Ataylor**: It's going to be Andrew.
**Ataylor**: Looks like finish that one out.
**Ataylor**: Nick, These owner sub change orders, did you get them all out last week?
**Gducharme**: Up to date?
**Gducharme**: For the most part.
**Ataylor**: I don't think there's anything else out there, is there?
**Ataylor**: For the owner?
**Gducharme**: Not that I can think of.
**Ataylor**: And Andrew, he signed all them and got them back to you?
**Gducharme**: He just needs to sign one for the vestibule.
**Ataylor**: Okay, Bug him about that tomorrow.
**Gducharme**: Are we doing the OAC tomorrow?
**Ataylor**: Yeah, yeah, we'll have to.
**Ataylor**: Andrew's not going to be it blooming into until 1230, so we may have the OACS and then leave and we'll be there right on time.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Aj, are you back with us?
**Ataylor**: Hey, Jay, your mic's off.
**Mcalcetero**: Nick, do you have some contract scopes for.
**Mcalcetero**: Well, for basically just commitments and stuff that you've written up in the past that I could pull from somewhere to get some ideas for writing up scopes for like the wet sprinkler system and some other stuff.
**Mcalcetero**: Elevators?
**Gducharme**: Just the ones that I've used for Bloomington and Bard.
**Mcalcetero**: Those are the only scopes, like scopes of works or contracts that you've written up.
**Gducharme**: I've only worked here like two, three months.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.

**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Sorry about that.
**Ataylor**: Finish this off.
**Ataylor**: All right.
**Ataylor**: So all we had left was Memphis cold storage.
**Ataylor**: New equipment, floor plan.
**Ataylor**: That's done.
**Njepson**: It's done.
**Ataylor**: Permit, fence.
**Ataylor**: We don't need a permit.

**Ataylor**: Design coordination in progress.
**Njepson**: Jesse, let's go through that tomorrow morning, okay?
**Ataylor**: We just need to do a schedule H VAC pricing.
**Ataylor**: Started to get that back or did you just.
**Njepson**: Yeah, I'm waiting on one more number to come in.
**Njepson**: I already got one, but I.
**Njepson**: I want to get it all plugged together and us for our meeting tomorrow.
**Ataylor**: Well, since Dylan made those original calls, you might want to follow up with them.
**Njepson**: Yeah, that's what I'm.
**Njepson**: That's what I'll do.
**Ataylor**: All right, then we had create escapes.
**Njepson**: Starting on all of our.
**Njepson**: I haven't heard back from Weston on that.
**Njepson**: As built I sent him.
**Njepson**: But we're starting on all the landscaping tomorrow.
**Njepson**: Hopefully I have it done this week.
**Njepson**: Start getting the punch list closed out for the TCO.
**Njepson**: Turf was finished.
**Njepson**: We have some fence punch list to do.
**Njepson**: I guess we're missing post caps, so I gotta order those.
**Njepson**: And then I told Brandon I'd get him that time lapse footage tonight.
**Njepson**: It's on an SD card somewhere in that junk of a trailer.
**Njepson**: So.
**Ataylor**: You can look in there and see what the signage is.
**Njepson**: Yeah, it's parked in my driveway.
**Ataylor**: No, I guess we're not using that stuff.
**Njepson**: Well, there's still some signs you can post up like on the site somewhere if you want.
**Njepson**: There's a bunch in there.
**Ataylor**: I didn't see that on yours.
**Ataylor**: For your grand opening.
**Ataylor**: Glenn is the sign.
**Ataylor**: We got that approved and getting ordered because you only got four weeks or less.
**Ataylor**: Less than four weeks.
**Mcalcetero**: No, Brandon didn't say anything to me about a sign.
**Mcalcetero**: He said to have Maria get a.
**Mcalcetero**: Get in coordination with him.
**Mcalcetero**: And we had that meeting this morning.
**Mcalcetero**: He was pretty distracted about it.
**Mcalcetero**: So the signs were on the list of stuff on my Westfield Collective that was on.
**Mcalcetero**: That's on him attached.
**Ataylor**: Mar has have you guys come up with the approved design for the group for the groundbreaking ceremony?
**Bclymer**: What design?
**Bclymer**: Sorry, I don't know.
**Bclymer**: We're just.
**Bclymer**: We're working just with journalists and trying to have the chamber of commerce there, but I don't know what designer you're talking, Jesse.
**Ataylor**: So there's.
**Ataylor**: We're going to put up our Alito sign with our name.
**Bclymer**: Oh, the sign.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So I sent it to Brandon.
**Bclymer**: I sent three options, and I think he's still deciding which one.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Did they tell you how long it would take them to make that sign?
**Bclymer**: No.
**Bclymer**: Ten days.
**Ataylor**: Ten days?
**Bclymer**: Ten business days.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: So we're gonna have to make a decision pretty quick.
**Bclymer**: Exactly.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I was expecting to have it by Friday last week, but Brandon, I think, was busy, so.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: Did you have the topping out on here?
**Ataylor**: Glenn, you might want to add something in the groundbreaking.
**Mcalcetero**: Sorry, I had the topping out.
**Mcalcetero**: I just had it as together.
**Mcalcetero**: The topping out is scheduled for that right now, but it's.
**Mcalcetero**: It's far enough out to.
**Mcalcetero**: I don't know if we want to lock that date in quite yet.
**Mcalcetero**: And groundbreaking ceremony is supposed to be the fourth at 11.
**Mcalcetero**: Now it's no longer the first at 1:30.
**Ataylor**: Four.
**Ataylor**: Four four.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: What else are we setting up for that groundbreak?
**Ataylor**: So, Maria, you said you're doing.
**Ataylor**: You're lining up the local celebrities.
**Bclymer**: Celebrities.
**Bclymer**: What do you want me to bring?
**Bclymer**: Just Taylor Swift.
**Bclymer**: Just kidding.
**Bclymer**: So, yeah, I'm talking with your.
**Bclymer**: I'm talking with journalists and with the chamber of commerce person that.
**Bclymer**: Her name is Katie, I think.
**Bclymer**: So she's just going to help us, you know, bringing people there so we can have like something related to the media.
**Bclymer**: And she said that the mayor is not going to be there because during the spring break he will be traveling.
**Bclymer**: But there are some other people that are going to join.
**Bclymer**: And you guys, I think you also guys are invited for that ceremony, so you should be there and then.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, just trying to coordinate that with her.
**Bclymer**: We have a meeting coming up soon this week, so we can have everything ready.
**Mcalcetero**: Katie is one of the owners, Maria.
**Mcalcetero**: She's not from the Chamber of Commerce.
**Bclymer**: So Katie is going to work with the person of the Chamber of Commerce.
**Bclymer**: Her name, I think is Courtney.
**Bclymer**: She says she's going to give us a meeting with the three of us, Katie Kearney and myself.
**Ataylor**: What time is it?
**Ataylor**: Was it noon or.

**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: And that's it relative to TCO and permit.
**Ataylor**: All right, well, I think that's it.
