## Transcript
**Erikaf**: Sa.
**Erikaf**: Hello everyone.
**Erikaf**: Sorry I'm a little late.
**Erikaf**: Sorry.
**Jannifer**: I think we're still waiting on Erica.
**Erikaf**: So.
**Erikaf**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Hey, everybody.
**Erikaf**: Hey.
**Erikaf**: How are you?
**Jdawson**: Good.
**Jdawson**: How are you guys doing?
**Jannifer**: Doing well.
**Jannifer**: Doing well.
**Jannifer**: Is it, is it Jennifer?
**Jannifer**: Am I saying that right?
**Jannifer**: Or is it, is it supposed to be Jennifer?
**Erikaf**: Just.
**Jannifer**: There's an A.
**Jdawson**: There it is an A.
**Jdawson**: It's Jennifer.
**Erikaf**: Okay, Gotcha.
**Erikaf**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: Alrighty.
**Jdawson**: So I guess I can jump right in.
**Jdawson**: I know we've talked a little bit.
**Jdawson**: I've spoke with Glenn, he's the initial one that I talked to about this.
**Jdawson**: So you guys know we are not able to do the work.
**Jdawson**: Unfortunately, we had some internal things going on with who I had running that department and I had to shut down that department very quickly.
**Jdawson**: So that's why little over a month ago we reached out and had conversations about, hey, you're going to have to find someone else to do this work.
**Jdawson**: I know that that puts you in a really bad position.
**Jdawson**: So I, I let him know how you know, I do feel really bad about this.
**Jdawson**: This is not something that we want to represent fight.
**Jdawson**: As our plumbing department is still going strong.
**Jdawson**: That's the department we've had since 1989 and we are still continuing to do plumbing new construction for that and the commercial work on that side.
**Jdawson**: So unfortunately I don't have the H Vac, but I do want to be able to hand off what we have thus far.
**Jdawson**: There were a lot of things that were already on order and in the loop so we can go through those items.
**Jdawson**: I have some of the items in our warehouse right now and, and then the RT user to be delivered.
**Jdawson**: They're actually on a truck.
**Jdawson**: I just got an update from Cook Air and they are on a truck heading our way and they said the delivery will be Monday or Tuesday.
**Jdawson**: Is there anticipation for that?
**Jdawson**: The other items that we already have in our warehouse are the power vent, gas, fire heaters.
**Jdawson**: We have the heat only stats that go with that.
**Jdawson**: And then we have.
**Jdawson**: And there's four of each of those and then four programmable thermostats.
**Jdawson**: Other than that, we do not have any other material that was on order in any process.
**Jdawson**: So we're kind of what I have reached out to some people that I know have commercial H VAC companies and they are not able to take it on.
**Jdawson**: So I mean, I would like to help, but right now I'm not able to help completing the work.
**Jannifer**: Gotcha.
**Jannifer**: So you've got your four RTUs you said are getting delivered to your warehouse on Monday and then you Said you already have the four Resner heaters.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Erikaf**: Okay.
**Erikaf**: And the.
**Jannifer**: The Reznor 125,000 BTU, correct?
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Erikaf**: Okay.
**Jannifer**: Because I think you had said something else, like a different brand.
**Jdawson**: Nope.
**Jdawson**: It says Res on the Invoice.
**Jdawson**: It says rez-udxc125.
**Erikaf**: Yep.
**Jannifer**: That's the right one.
**Jdawson**: Okay, perfect.
**Jannifer**: Okay.
**Jannifer**: And so, you know, as far as getting that stuff, you know, you mentioned you want a change order.
**Jannifer**: Like, I was confused because from what I see, and you know, I've got this contract, I don't know if you looked at it, but, you know, for $204,000, you guys said, hey, well, you know, furnish and install a complete H VAC system for this building.
**Jannifer**: And did that not include the units and Resner heaters or what is the change?
**Jdawson**: It.
**Jdawson**: It did include all of that.
**Jdawson**: I just was requesting a change order to show the deduction of not including doing the work, because we won't be able to do the work.
**Jdawson**: So the total right now is going to be, you know, the material I just listed and the cost of the design and less that from the 204.
**Jdawson**: So just a revision to the contract to show what the design and then the material we can provide you.
**Jannifer**: And what's that number?
**Jannifer**: I don't think you've ever.
**Jannifer**: I've heard that yet.
**Jdawson**: Let me see.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so we did not.
**Jdawson**: We did not mark up any of the material.
**Jdawson**: I just didn't feel ethically right to be able to do that to you guys.
**Jdawson**: So the design we have at 24,543 and the material I just listed, including the four RTUs that will be delivered on Monday, is $51,692.
**Jdawson**: So that totals $76,235.
**Jannifer**: You said design was 24,543.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: That was from Spencer.
**Jdawson**: There are two invoices on that.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So I was just trying to be, you know, as clean with everything as I possibly could just to help you guys out.
**Jdawson**: I know that I think Jennifer might have gotten the login or set up a login, but there was still access to the site that she was going to need, granted, that she didn't have as of this morning.
**Jdawson**: So I know there's some things she would need on billing if you want us to run that through there still.
**Erikaf**: Okay, so you.
**Jannifer**: And tell me that total again.
**Jannifer**: You said it's the.
**Jannifer**: You said the 24, 5.
**Jannifer**: 43.
**Jannifer**: And then what was the.
**Jannifer**: The material number?
**Jdawson**: $51,692, 692.
**Erikaf**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Erikaf**: Okay.
**Jannifer**: So, yeah.
**Jannifer**: So, you know, obviously we were, we were hoping that you could, you know, fulfill the, the promise.
**Jannifer**: So basically what you're saying is, hey, you know, we, we are going to default on our contract.
**Jannifer**: We'd like to go ahead and get paid for everything that we've done and then you guys hire somebody else to, to do the work.
**Jannifer**: Is that accurate?
**Jdawson**: No, I'm.
**Jdawson**: I'm not going to be able to hire anybody.
**Jdawson**: I. I don't have any.
**Jdawson**: No, no, I'm sorry to do that.
**Jannifer**: Let me.
**Jannifer**: I don't think you heard me correctly.
**Jannifer**: I said what, what you're saying is like fight is going to default on the contract to do the entire project.
**Jannifer**: You would like to go ahead and get paid for what you have in it, all your material and design, and then we alito need to go out and hire a new contractor to finish your work.
**Jannifer**: Is that accurate?
**Jdawson**: Yes, that is accurate.
**Erikaf**: Okay.
**Jannifer**: So we went and got some bids and our lowest bid, we got about seven of them.
**Jannifer**: Trying to do as much as we can.
**Jannifer**: Here is 271, 240.
**Jannifer**: So, you know, if I take, you know, your base contract, which is 221, it was 204/$17,000 change order, then that brings you to 221, you know, plus your design.
**Jannifer**: Okay.
**Jannifer**: And then that leaves me with a $74,783 exposure, meaning out of my pocket.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I'm following your numbers.
**Jdawson**: I. I'm kind of surprised because that's drastically over.
**Jdawson**: But I mean, your numbers are what your numbers are.
**Jdawson**: I mean, I. Yeah, I'm.
**Jdawson**: I'm just not able to fulfill the work I don't have.
**Jdawson**: Unless you guys would like a bunch of plumbers to do it.
**Jdawson**: Probably not, no.
**Jannifer**: But I, I am a little perplexed that you want to be compensated for everything that you've done to where you're getting out of this thing scot free.
**Jdawson**: I'm definitely not getting out scot free.
**Jdawson**: I understand where you're the only.
**Jannifer**: Really?
**Jannifer**: I mean, you want to get paid for every third party stuff?
**Jannifer**: Because I understand that you have internal man hours and things like that, which I have a ton of them too, just because of this.
**Jannifer**: So let's take the internal manpowers out.
**Jannifer**: These are just third party bills.
**Jannifer**: Now.
**Jannifer**: I've got a $74,000 73 exposure to third party.
**Jannifer**: You know, I've got to eat the internal man hours already.
**Jannifer**: Going out, rebidding it, figuring this out, reworking the schedule, little Bit of work goes into that as, you know.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jannifer**: So essentially, you know, minus, you know, the money that you had, these guys that did whatever, you know, internally, which is, you know, it is what it is.
**Jannifer**: Like I'm taking all of the loss and you are getting fully compensated for all of your third party bills.
**Jdawson**: I mean.
**Jannifer**: Yeah, okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I have, I have nothing to say.
**Jdawson**: I mean, I mean, it does.
**Jdawson**: I, I understand what you're saying and I truly understand your frustration.
**Jdawson**: I not sure how, how much further I can help.
**Jannifer**: Well, so at the end of the day, right, so there's a few ways that we can do this.
**Jannifer**: Okay, so legally you're on the hook.
**Jannifer**: Is there like, there's no doubt there.
**Jannifer**: Contract signed, everything's in order, you're defaulting, you put you on notice, take you to court, we'll spend a bunch of money.
**Jannifer**: But at the end day, I will win.
**Jannifer**: Like there's no doubt about that.
**Jannifer**: Now I am a bit perplexed that as a business owner and you know, for me, I started this company, my word is my bond.
**Jannifer**: So I'm not going to go back to the owner and say, hey, listen, I know I told you one thing, but can't do it, give me more money.
**Jannifer**: That doesn't happen.
**Erikaf**: Right.
**Jannifer**: The fact that you're saying that surprises me, but we all run our own business, our own way.
**Jannifer**: So the fact that you want me to pick up all the dime to where you can just walk away with this scot free isn't going to happen.
**Jannifer**: Now we can work something out, you know, to try to help each other, but there is no world where you just get off this and I take all the blank.
**Jdawson**: I, I definitely want to help.
**Jdawson**: I mean, I, I don't want you just to be totally screwed.
**Jdawson**: I just was agreeing with your math if I'm being honest.
**Jdawson**: But I mean, I can, we can talk, we can negotiate, and I can see what I can do to help you guys out.
**Erikaf**: Okay.
**Jannifer**: What's that look like?
**Jdawson**: Well, let me do some math here.
**Jdawson**: Hold on just a sec.
**Jdawson**: I mean, the first thing that I would like to suggest is if, you know, if you would be willing, I would like to see the bid numbers that came through and work direct with those companies on helping alleviate their labor costs and working with them.
**Jdawson**: And then that way not a lot of it runs through you guys.
**Jdawson**: You see my screen, it's really small.
**Jdawson**: So hold on just a sec.
**Jdawson**: We're going to make this screen bigger.
**Jdawson**: Wow, the mic's not working at all.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And that's the Lowest one you guys.
**Jannifer**: Received, that's the lowest.
**Jannifer**: Here's the second.
**Jannifer**: That's without units.
**Erikaf**: Okay.
**Jannifer**: This one is with the units.
**Jannifer**: The unit value is this.
**Jannifer**: So if you take that off, then it's the 216.
**Jannifer**: 5.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jannifer**: You know, we've gotten, I think, eight different numbers off this.
**Jannifer**: I mean, Dean, mission, mechanical, a couple other.
**Jannifer**: I can't remember all of them, but, you know, obviously I last thing I want to do is, you know, have anybody go through this.
**Jannifer**: And so.
**Jannifer**: Yeah, I mean, I put a couple guys on to get as many numbers as we could to try to get down.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, no, I understand.
**Jdawson**: Well, if you wouldn't mind, I would like to get in contact with some of them and see if I can work with them on that.
**Jdawson**: And then maybe we can have a.
**Jdawson**: Another call scheduled for Monday.
**Jdawson**: Certainly Monday at 1.
**Jdawson**: Would that be something we can do?
**Jdawson**: And I can see how I can keep things moving for you guys.
**Jannifer**: One works for me on Monday.
**Jannifer**: Jesse, you.
**Erikaf**: Let me look here.
**Erikaf**: Yeah, that'll work.
**Erikaf**: Okay.
**Jannifer**: Yeah, we'll send out an invite for Monday at 1.
**Jannifer**: You want same.
**Jannifer**: Same people?
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: Go ahead and send it to me and Jennifer and then we will see what we can do for you.

**Jdawson**: All right, thanks.
**Jdawson**: Have a good one.
**Erikaf**: Thank you.
