**Accounting**: Is that Core admin invoices?
**Accounting**: Fatima, Brandon asked to add a.
**Jdawson**: Change.
**Accounting**: Order since the the PO is already available in Job Planner.
**Accounting**: But it seems not enough po.
**Accounting**: So we need to have the change order.
**Accounting**: So he's asking.
**Accounting**: I am not sure if he's asking us to create a change order or Alex for that one, so.
**Accounting**: Because we don't.
**Accounting**: Yeah, we.
**Accounting**: I. I'm not also aware on how to do it in Job Planner.
**Accounting**: That change order.
**Accounting**: And then we don't do that.
**Jdawson**: We don't do that.
**Jdawson**: The project managers is.
**Jdawson**: Product managers are responsible for that because they control their budget.
**Jdawson**: So just send.
**Jdawson**: And send them forward.
**Jdawson**: Send a message to Alex and you can CC me and just let him know to see Brandon's email below.
**Accounting**: I have already sent an email.
**Accounting**: I replied to Brandon's email and then I. Yeah, it's Alex.
**Accounting**: To Alex and Brandon.
**Accounting**: So I just mentioned the total invoices and then I also put the screenshot of the job planner.
**Accounting**: The total available PO for that.
**Jdawson**: Okay, and who is the project manager on that?
**Accounting**: I think it's Alex.
**Jdawson**: Alex is a superintendent.
**Bclymer**: Who.
**Jdawson**: What project is that?
**Accounting**: Seva Burnville.
**Bclymer**: Also I think that's Nick.
**Jdawson**: If I'm not wrong, that's Nick.
**Bclymer**: I think so.
**Bclymer**: Okay, give me one second.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I have it here.
**Bclymer**: So Seva is college, you know, right now.
**Bclymer**: So Silver Consulting Building, Right, Fritzi?
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: No, this is Brandon.
**Jdawson**: Oh, okay.
**Jdawson**: Oh, Brandon.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so maybe that's why he's asking Alex to do it.
**Jdawson**: Maria, can you share that list with us?
**Jdawson**: The list of projects and.
**Jdawson**: And yeah, the project managers.
**Bclymer**: So I'll show you.
**Bclymer**: It's here in Notion.
**Bclymer**: So let me just share my screen with you guys.
**Bclymer**: So here.
**Bclymer**: Can you see the projects here?
**Bclymer**: So.
**Jdawson**: Oh, can you see them?
**Bclymer**: Okay, so if you go for example to for example Createscape and you click on open and you see the owner is aj so he is a pm.
**Jdawson**: He's a pm okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And for example Siva Consulting Building.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: So the owner is Brandon in Mike Parson.
**Bclymer**: So it can be as Mike Parson.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So Mike is the superintendent, the traveling superintendent.
**Bclymer**: So in this case, yeah.
**Bclymer**: Brandon is, you know, the one taking care of it.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Jdawson**: So is.
**Jdawson**: Is Alex even on that job?
**Bclymer**: Alex is never in any of these jobs, to be honest.
**Bclymer**: Like, the only persons that are here is, you know, for example, here AJ, Nick.
**Bclymer**: For example, here Glenn.
**Bclymer**: Only the PMs.
**Jdawson**: Only the PMs.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: So Fritz, forward that.
**Jdawson**: That email to Mike also.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Something else that we need besides Siva.
**Bclymer**: I know, but that's different.
**Bclymer**: Brandon is working on that too.
**Bclymer**: What else?
**Bclymer**: Jose?
**Bclymer**: Something missing on your site?
**Justin**: Yeah, well, I had a question for.
**Justin**: Because I have a doubt for Fitzi and for Fatima.
**Justin**: But I would like to share my screen, if you don't mind.
**Bclymer**: Of course.
**Bclymer**: Go for it.
**Bclymer**: You can share it.
**Accounting**: Yeah.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Justin**: Yesterday in the operation meeting, I was required for JESI to confirm some.
**Justin**: Let's see.
**Justin**: Oh yeah, to confirm the check payment.
**Justin**: I mean, to check payment for some project.
**Justin**: For example Gravescape, it says check payment.
**Justin**: And also in here that is the task to check payment.
**Justin**: I understand that we need to confirm if we have been paid for the project owner for the last payment for this.
**Justin**: For this project.
**Justin**: So I. I have the account receivable aging at this date up to date.
**Justin**: And then I have the open balance for every single required project.
**Justin**: And this is the open open balance per account receivable.
**Justin**: But I think that is the information we.
**Justin**: We need to confirm to Jesse.
**Justin**: But for Great Escape, I have.
**Justin**: I have no open balance in account receivable.
**Justin**: But when I see the project, I have doubt how to confirm the amount or if we are.
**Justin**: Yeah, yeah, well, that is my doubt.
**Accounting**: For example, sorry, what is the requirement here?
**Justin**: The requirement says to check payment because we need to confirm check payment for all the commitments.
**Accounting**: Is that related to the commitments?
**Justin**: I mean, for at least ar.
**Jdawson**: I think.
**Jdawson**: I think this is for AR payments, right?
**Accounting**: Ah, okay.
**Jdawson**: Billing.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Justin**: For arm for owners billing.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Justin**: And yeah, but I have the.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Justin**: Account receivable aging.
**Justin**: But I'm not sure if this need to be.
**Justin**: This is the information we need to confirm because I have this data open for open invoices in account receivable.
**Accounting**: For all the data in AR aging, it means that it does not paid yet.
**Accounting**: So we have not received any payment yet.
**Accounting**: So far we are updated with a bank receipt or the receipt that we received from the owner.
**Accounting**: So AR aging is updated.
**Accounting**: So whatever it is in the AR aging, it's not paid yet.
**Justin**: Yeah, so.
**Jdawson**: So do they want to see a list of outstanding AR invoices or do they want them, do they want you to show them?
**Jdawson**: Okay, job number 25113.
**Jdawson**: Paid invoice, whatever.
**Jdawson**: Whatever paid on this date.
**Jdawson**: So do they want you to show them the payments received or the outstanding items?
**Jdawson**: They may want to see the outstanding items, yes.
**Jdawson**: Is that what they said?
**Justin**: Yeah, the test is to check payment.
**Justin**: I mean I would like to show what in here, for example.
**Justin**: Yeah, create Escape, for example, it says check payment.
**Justin**: This is the task.
**Justin**: And what I understand is we need to confirm.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Justin**: The open balance in account receivable.
**Justin**: But also if we have been paid, I think for the last payment.
**Justin**: Because well, that is my doubt if.
**Jdawson**: If the AR agent is saying what's, what's the job number for craterscapes?
**Jdawson**: 24 101.
**Justin**: Yeah, crazy is.
**Justin**: Yeah, 24 101.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so project 24101 as of 7 8, there's no outstanding balances.
**Jdawson**: Everything has been paid as of today.
**Jdawson**: So check.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So whatever you have on there is.
**Jdawson**: Is correct.
**Jdawson**: So what you do is you, you.
**Jdawson**: You may go to notion on the.
**Jdawson**: The status you just put paid.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Justin**: Okay, that should.
**Justin**: Huh.
**Justin**: Okay, I understand.
**Jdawson**: No, where it says not started.
**Jdawson**: Where it says not not started, click on that and then just put done.
**Jdawson**: Make it done.
**Jdawson**: So this is asking what have you done?
**Jdawson**: Have you started the progress?
**Jdawson**: Have you not?
**Justin**: Oop, I. Yeah, I.
**Bclymer**: It's okay, don't worry.
**Bclymer**: So that, that was.
**Bclymer**: So I can fix it.
**Bclymer**: So if you go to status, go to status.
**Bclymer**: Jose, in the title, you see where it says filter below?
**Bclymer**: Edit property.
**Bclymer**: Click on Filter.
**Bclymer**: Click on Filter and then click where it says complete.
**Bclymer**: You see the, the square next to complete, click there.
**Bclymer**: There you go.
**Bclymer**: So now you can see everything.
**Bclymer**: So now clicking in.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: So if you click wherever you want to go, just click outside in another.
**Bclymer**: Exactly.
**Bclymer**: So which one is the one that you need to change?
**Bclymer**: Fatima?
**Jdawson**: It was the check.
**Jdawson**: Check payment he was just looking for.
**Bclymer**: So there you go.
**Bclymer**: Scroll down, scroll down Jose, please.
**Bclymer**: There it is.
**Bclymer**: So check payment is done.
**Jdawson**: So now it's done.
**Jdawson**: So now in the last cell you can add a note.
**Jdawson**: Add a note and say all payments.
**Justin**: Received to date in here.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Or if you want in the check payment.
**Bclymer**: Because when you need to create a property.
**Bclymer**: So where it says check payment, click on open.
**Bclymer**: Click where it says open and then in the comment section where you add a comment.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: No, below comments.
**Bclymer**: There you go, right there.
**Bclymer**: Click there Jose and then add a comment.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Justin**: All payment received.
**Bclymer**: Yes, all payments were received.
**Bclymer**: And then you want to put the date of today.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: You can say 7, 8, 20, 25.
**Bclymer**: And then do you see the little blue arrow?
**Bclymer**: Click on that one.
**Bclymer**: Click on it.
**Bclymer**: There you go.
**Bclymer**: That's it.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So if, if you go to the.
**Jdawson**: The other items like let's say Siva Burnville, you will do the.
**Jdawson**: The same thing.
**Jdawson**: And okay, just add a note saying invoice number 307 unpaid or.
**Jdawson**: Or open as of 7, 8, 20, 25.
**Jdawson**: And whenever it's paid, you just go back and update that.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Justin**: Because for this year we have this open invoice per ar.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Justin**: Agent.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jdawson**: So Francie, whenever you receive a payment, let Jose know so he can come back and update this.
**Bclymer**: So Jose, to exit, do you know how to go back to the other projects?
**Jdawson**: Correct.
**Justin**: For example.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So you see the add.
**Bclymer**: Perfect.
**Bclymer**: That's awesome.
**Bclymer**: There you go.
**Bclymer**: And then you can look for it.
**Bclymer**: And then also.
**Bclymer**: Okay, good.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Justin**: And where should I.
**Bclymer**: So I think that was already.
**Bclymer**: That was.
**Bclymer**: If you want to create a task, click on it.
**Bclymer**: So new task.
**Justin**: Yeah, but we don't have a task in here.
**Justin**: Right.
**Bclymer**: So it's the same one.
**Bclymer**: Right?
**Justin**: Okay, yeah.
**Bclymer**: No, so my question to you is you need to put here that you also need to pay.
**Bclymer**: I mean, the check was paid or.
**Justin**: Yeah, I will put that.
**Justin**: We have an open.
**Bclymer**: Exactly.
**Bclymer**: So if you want to create a new task, so create it right there, click on it, and then you can put payments or check payments and then click done like we did previously.
**Bclymer**: So change the name of the task in here.
**Bclymer**: No, so you see what it says Task.
**Bclymer**: Okay, Right there, change the name of the task, change it to check payments or payments, something like that related to payments.
**Bclymer**: And then you see where it says not started.
**Bclymer**: So now you can move that one to click there.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, just click on it where it says not, not started.
**Jdawson**: Just click right there.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yes, Click there.
**Bclymer**: And then you can click on done.
**Bclymer**: But before you, before you change it to dawn, make sure to create a comment first.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Because once you create, once you put on done, it's going to move it to the back end.
**Bclymer**: So again, so go back to the status.
**Bclymer**: Click where it says the status.
**Bclymer**: Please filter complete or done.
**Bclymer**: Click on it and then check for the one that you created, the check payments.
**Bclymer**: There you go.
**Bclymer**: Click on open.
**Bclymer**: Open.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So this is what you should do.
**Jdawson**: I think you should filter by the assign, assign to and click on your name.
**Jdawson**: That way you always see all of your items for you.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so click out of this Exit out of this.
**Bclymer**: So wait, before that, click your comment Jose.
**Bclymer**: So check payments and then leave the comment you wanted to leave.
**Bclymer**: So Brandon knows exactly what you're talking about.
**Bclymer**: So check payments, go to open.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, okay, leave the comment above.
**Bclymer**: Above.
**Bclymer**: Comments.
**Bclymer**: Comments.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Justin**: Comments.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Justin**: So click write a comment and open the inv.
**Bclymer**: And then.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And then for example, you see where it says assign?
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: It says empty.
**Bclymer**: Click where it says empty, find your name.
**Bclymer**: There you go.
**Bclymer**: Click there.
**Bclymer**: And that's it.
**Bclymer**: Now you can exit from here, you can exit from this task and the project, and then you can do what Fatima is saying.
**Bclymer**: So get out of there.
**Bclymer**: Just go back to projects.
**Justin**: Okay, I will.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So go back to projects.
**Bclymer**: You are on the civa consulting.
**Bclymer**: So go back to projects above.
**Bclymer**: There you go.
**Bclymer**: So now if you're going to filter, you see where it says.
**Bclymer**: You see up all the way.
**Bclymer**: I don't know how to take control here, so I don't know all the way.
**Jdawson**: It's like owner, where it says owner.
**Bclymer**: No, no, the owner is different from.
**Bclymer**: No, the owner is different from the as I need.
**Bclymer**: So you see where it says filter all the way above Jose next to owner.
**Bclymer**: There you go.
**Bclymer**: Click there.
**Bclymer**: And then you're going to look for the.
**Bclymer**: There has to be something that is called assignment.
**Jdawson**: So this is not gonna have an assignee, because it's not a task.
**Jdawson**: These are just the projects.
**Jdawson**: So he has to go into every project, create a task, and then change the assignee on the task.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Accounting**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: Which, what job is next that you have to do?
**Justin**: Core mark.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so let's say go back to create escapes.
**Jdawson**: Because you've.
**Jdawson**: You've already done.
**Jdawson**: Done that one.
**Jdawson**: So click on create escapes.
**Jdawson**: No, in the projects.
**Jdawson**: Create escapes.
**Justin**: Yeah, below.
**Jdawson**: Down, Down.
**Jdawson**: Keep going.
**Jdawson**: Right there.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, open it.
**Jdawson**: So you see how.
**Jdawson**: Where it says assign.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, click on that.
**Jdawson**: You filter.
**Bclymer**: No, filter.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, and then look for your name.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: So you want it to be like.
**Jdawson**: Like.
**Jdawson**: Like this.
**Jdawson**: And you want the status to pick up everything.
**Jdawson**: That way when you come here, you only see what you see, everything that's assigned to you, whether it's done in progress, completed, whatever it is, you see it.
**Jdawson**: So, so when you go into assign the payment status for each one, you do that and then you can add a task, add a task, name it, check payment for the ones you haven't done.
**Jdawson**: The two aspire.
**Jdawson**: This one you already have a task, so you go to.
**Jdawson**: Same thing.
**Jdawson**: You go to Aspire, you add a task and then you edit the filters and add the note.
**Justin**: Okay, great.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So make sure you do this because they bill once a month.
**Jdawson**: So they bill monthly.
**Jdawson**: So make sure that at the end of the month or maybe every week, just check if there's a status, you update it.
**Jdawson**: If it's paid, you don't have to check because they bill once a month.
**Jdawson**: But for these items that are not paid, just go in and see if they have received payment or not offered.
**Jdawson**: So you can let you know whenever payment is received.
**Justin**: Okay, great.
**Justin**: I got it.
**Jdawson**: Yeah?
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay, perfect.
**Bclymer**: That's good.

**Bclymer**: So we'll go, what is this?
**Bclymer**: Free tea.
**Bclymer**: What are the things?
**Bclymer**: You know?
**Bclymer**: But instead of asking to Brandon, it's more like we're doing this, this and that.
