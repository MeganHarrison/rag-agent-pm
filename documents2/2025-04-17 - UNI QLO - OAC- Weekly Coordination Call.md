## Transcript
**Bryan.wagar**: Hey, guys.
**Bryan.wagar**: Hey, Ben.
**Ken.mathewson**: Hi.
**Ken.mathewson**: Oh, maybe we can start.
**Ken.mathewson**: Are we waiting for somebody?
**David.leddy**: I don't believe the Eliato team is going to join because they have the.
**David.leddy**: The Fireflies thing on, so they just take the meeting minutes and then they review it.
**David.leddy**: But I think we need to first just discuss the permit sets, which are all getting released tomorrow, so.
**Ken.mathewson**: Okay.
**Ken.mathewson**: Okay.
**Ken.mathewson**: Okay.
**David.leddy**: Yeah.
**David.leddy**: So we're shipping all the drawings out tomorrow.
**David.leddy**: If FedEx is closed tomorrow, I'm gonna take them home, and then I'll just ship them on Saturday morning to overnight to the gentleman.
**David.leddy**: I forgot his name.
**David.leddy**: I think his name was Jack.
**Ken.mathewson**: Yeah, Jack.
**David.leddy**: No, the.
**David.leddy**: So the gc.
**David.leddy**: We're shipping it to the gc, and the GC will just take it directly to the dov.
**Ken.mathewson**: Oh, the Jack is the Al guy, correct?
**David.leddy**: He's.
**David.leddy**: He's their representative.
**Ken.mathewson**: Okay.
**David.leddy**: Okay.
**Ken.mathewson**: And you got no.
**Ken.mathewson**: No concern on gathering the drawings?
**David.leddy**: Oh, the drawings are just getting plotted.
**David.leddy**: I think Henderson is shipping theirs out today.
**David.leddy**: It should be at TPG's office tomorrow.
**David.leddy**: And then we have the labels, we have the transmittal ready.
**David.leddy**: We have the architecturals already in hand.
**David.leddy**: I know that AUE ship their drawings, and I have the tracking number.
**David.leddy**: So I'm just waiting to receive that first thing tomorrow.
**David.leddy**: Exotext drawings.
**David.leddy**: We're just waiting for the link to come in.
**David.leddy**: And I believe I just spoke to Brandon briefly via text, and he confirmed that, yes, they will be plotting exotext drawings.
**David.leddy**: Three copies, along with our drawings.
**Race.kangas**: Yeah, those.
**Race.kangas**: Those, Amma.
**Race.kangas**: Those were the links I sent.
**Race.kangas**: When did I send those?
**Race.kangas**: Is it earlier this week or last week?
**Race.kangas**: Okay.
**David.leddy**: Oh, nice.
**Bryan.wagar**: Nice.
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay.
**Bryan.wagar**: All right.
**David.leddy**: So, yeah, so we have.
**David.leddy**: We have those.
**David.leddy**: So then once.
**David.leddy**: Once we have all of the links.
**David.leddy**: Yusuke, what I'll do is.
**David.leddy**: Is zip up the Henderson drawings, aue, tpg, Exotex, and I'll give you one clean link that you can just download everything, one shot.
**David.leddy**: So then your team will have a full copy.
**David.leddy**: And then we just.
**David.leddy**: It's now a waiting game, basically, for the permit.
**David.leddy**: I'll call the permitting gentleman, maybe like on Wednesday, just to touch base with him and just, you know, see if we can get things moving fast.
**Ken.mathewson**: The Wednesday was.
**Ken.mathewson**: Was the guy from dob.
**David.leddy**: If.
**David.leddy**: Yeah, if Aliato submits the drawings on Monday, I'll just kind of call him just to touch base and see if.
**David.leddy**: If he feels that anything is missing or anything that he needs clarification on.
**David.leddy**: But then I'll.
**David.leddy**: I'll see.
**David.leddy**: How long does he believe the duration will be?
**David.leddy**: If it's like a Week or less.
**David.leddy**: That would be great.
**Ken.mathewson**: Okay.
**Ken.mathewson**: Okay.
**Ken.mathewson**: But apparently can start seeing the drawing sets and start preparing the.
**Ken.mathewson**: Exactly.
**Ken.mathewson**: Construction drawing.
**Ken.mathewson**: Like shop drawing.
**David.leddy**: Correct.
**David.leddy**: Yes.
**David.leddy**: So then they can at least get started on that.
**David.leddy**: The only thing that we just need to issue the bulletin for to reflect those convenience outlets for the printers, which we could take care of, like, after the permit set is issued.
**Ken.mathewson**: It's about the printer cable drop.
**David.leddy**: Yeah, those.
**David.leddy**: But those are not like, oh, the DOB needs them now.
**David.leddy**: It's not like threatening because you have spare switches everywhere in your panels, so it shouldn't be an issue to add on.
**David.leddy**: And then down the line at the end of the project, once the SkyPods are completed, in case there's like any shifts in the field, any modifications that need to happen in the drawings will reflect those in a final revision and then that revision will go to you.
**David.leddy**: We'll go to the landlord, and we'll also go back to the DOB as a PAA set.
**Ken.mathewson**: Okay.
**Ken.mathewson**: PA kind of as built set.
**David.leddy**: It's going to be like an as built.
**David.leddy**: Exactly.
**David.leddy**: Yeah.
**Ken.mathewson**: Okay.
**Ken.mathewson**: Okay.
**Ken.mathewson**: All right.
**Ken.mathewson**: I understand about the process of design process.
**Ken.mathewson**: And how about the cable drops for.
**Ken.mathewson**: You said 16 cable drop.
**Ken.mathewson**: We have.
**Ken.mathewson**: Yeah.
**Joseph.burdzy**: So we.
**David.leddy**: Yeah.
**David.leddy**: So so far we have 16 purchased ones.
**David.leddy**: We've only gathered 13.
**David.leddy**: So we need to delegate three more, including printer.
**David.leddy**: Right, that includes the printers.
**David.leddy**: Yes, yes.
**David.leddy**: That's just for the outlets.
**David.leddy**: So we have three more outlets.
**David.leddy**: And per my discussions with Brandon, since they're not in the drawings, he's asking us to remain conscious and try to stay as close as possible to the other ones that we're dropping.
**David.leddy**: These other outlets that we're dropping, if they're close by, it shouldn't be a dramatic cost.
**David.leddy**: And it's not going to be a cost is what he was saying.
**David.leddy**: But if you try to put them very far away and whatnot, since they're not in the drawings, that would be an additional cost.
**Ken.mathewson**: Sorry, I didn't get.
**Ken.mathewson**: What will be the additional cost?
**David.leddy**: The con, if you locate them far away from the plan.
**David.leddy**: So remember how we put them all, like four in a row and then we have one on the column.
**Ken.mathewson**: Yeah.
**Ken.mathewson**: Center.
**Ken.mathewson**: Center.
**David.leddy**: Yeah.
**David.leddy**: So, like, try to keep them in around that panel, that electrical panel by that column.
**David.leddy**: As long as it's within that vicinity, it's fine.
**David.leddy**: But if you go far, plan north and whatnot, then it's.
**David.leddy**: Then it's getting trickier because they're not on the drawings currently.
**Ken.mathewson**: So as of now, we're good, right?
**Joseph.burdzy**: So far.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Yes.
**David.leddy**: Right.
**David.leddy**: Now Based off of what you needed from the kickoff call presentation, they are.
**David.leddy**: He will accommodate those.
**Joseph.burdzy**: He said that's fine.
**David.leddy**: And especially that it's within the vicinity of where we were planning the quads.
**David.leddy**: He said that's fine.
**David.leddy**: But if we try to add any additional ones now, like sporadically on the sides of the sky pod or plan north of the plan, it might be an additional cost because he, he did not allocate anything for that.
**David.leddy**: And he runs there.
**Ken.mathewson**: Okay.
**Ken.mathewson**: Okay.
**Ken.mathewson**: Okay.
**Ken.mathewson**: So as of again understand, as of now, we're, we're good.
**Ken.mathewson**: And in 16, it's not included for the cable.
**Ken.mathewson**: Cable input for Skypod cabinet, right?
**Ken.mathewson**: Power cabinet.
**Brian.hammond**: That's correct.
**Ken.mathewson**: It's besides 16.
**Brian.hammond**: Correct is okay.
**Brian.hammond**: The, the 16 that they have accounted for are just for workstations.
**Brian.hammond**: Power drops for 120 volt power.
**Brian.hammond**: They also have the eight for the SkyPod drops included elsewhere in their contract.
**Ken.mathewson**: Okay, okay, so.
**Brian.hammond**: So every, everything's accounted for in terms of power.
**Ken.mathewson**: Okay.
**Ken.mathewson**: Okay.
**Ken.mathewson**: Okay.
**Ken.mathewson**: Understand.
**Ken.mathewson**: So so far so good.
**Ken.mathewson**: We're not having like additional costs from Aliato?
**David.leddy**: No, no.
**David.leddy**: So far we even said that, you know, they, they usually understand that when they build exotic systems, there's always printers in those areas.
**David.leddy**: So that's why he even added those, the extra numbers, even though we were showing in the pre bid package, we were showing 8 and 8.
**David.leddy**: So that's why he has 16.
**David.leddy**: So we can just locate them like consciously and we should be okay.
**David.leddy**: Okay, But I told him that you will follow up with a sketch.
**David.leddy**: So whenever you're ready, please send us a sketch where you want those additional three.
**David.leddy**: So then we finish the 16.
**Ken.mathewson**: Yeah.
**Ken.mathewson**: If we are going to use something for the cable, yeah, we can fix it.
**Ken.mathewson**: But as of now, we don't have any plans for using those three.
**Ken.mathewson**: So how should I do this?
**David.leddy**: You can get a credit back for them is what he was telling me.
**Bryan.wagar**: So it's up to you.
**Ken.mathewson**: Or we can just.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Leave the money.
**David.leddy**: In the bucket in case if something happens down the line, okay.
**David.leddy**: Like you know, leave, leave your bucket.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Of money all the way to the.
**David.leddy**: End and then, and then we'll see what happens.
**Joseph.burdzy**: But right now you still, you still.
**David.leddy**: Have three convenience outlets that need to be located within that vicinity of the.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Skypath area of shipping out.
**Ken.mathewson**: Okay, so we have to inform any fixed location or.
**David.leddy**: He just needs approximations like similarly to the sketch I sent.
**David.leddy**: I put like little yellow boxes for him and I told him like it's around here, here, here.
**David.leddy**: He just needs something to just show where those additional Three will be okay.
**Ken.mathewson**: Okay.
**Ken.mathewson**: All right.
**Ken.mathewson**: I'm good about the cable job part.
**David.leddy**: So I'm not sure if the GC is going to start a new calendar invite and whatnot, but right now I still have hours set, so then everyone's calendar is kind of blocked, but this is a message for the Aliato team.
**David.leddy**: Whenever you guys get a chance to issue an invite, a weekly invite for the team.
**David.leddy**: And then we'll end this one whenever.
**David.leddy**: Whenever you guys do issue that.
**David.leddy**: And then now, Yusuke, do you have any questions, comments, concerns at this time?
**Joseph.burdzy**: Did my mic drop?
**Brian.hammond**: I can.
**Brian.hammond**: I can still hear you, Ahmed.
**Joseph.burdzy**: No, because sometimes this laptop freaks out and it drops.
**Joseph.burdzy**: It says like, I don't have a microphone even though it's built in.
**Ken.mathewson**: I think that's.
**Bryan.wagar**: Sorry, sorry.
**Bryan.wagar**: No, no, you're fine.
**Ken.mathewson**: My network was not.
**Ken.mathewson**: It's not good.
**Ken.mathewson**: Amit, did you say something?
**Joseph.burdzy**: Yeah, I just wanted to see if you have any questions, comments or concerns.
**Joseph.burdzy**: We can raise it right now with the team.
**Ken.mathewson**: Okay.
**Ken.mathewson**: Okay.
**Ken.mathewson**: Brian, can you follow up the consumption of the electrical power for Skypod?
**Brian.hammond**: Yeah, apologies.
**Brian.hammond**: We're trying to get the permit set out today and focused on getting that one plotted.
**Brian.hammond**: I'll try and follow up tomorrow morning with.
**Brian.hammond**: To your email.
**Brian.hammond**: It should be pretty, pretty quick for me to pull that together and.
**Ken.mathewson**: Okay, okay.
**Ken.mathewson**: Just.
**Ken.mathewson**: Just for just brief.
**Ken.mathewson**: It's.
**Ken.mathewson**: It's.
**Ken.mathewson**: Okay.
**Ken.mathewson**: It's.
**Ken.mathewson**: It's not.
**Ken.mathewson**: It's.
**Ken.mathewson**: It's.
**Ken.mathewson**: It don't have to be accurate.
**Brian.hammond**: And then I think.
**Brian.hammond**: Okay, never mind.
**Brian.hammond**: You.
**Brian.hammond**: You just need a question.
**Brian.hammond**: An answer to the second question from us.
**Ken.mathewson**: Not the first question.
**Ken.mathewson**: Yes.
**Brian.hammond**: Okay.
**Brian.hammond**: I thought when I read that before, you.
**Brian.hammond**: You said you needed the second question answered as well, which was the when it would be in start installed and startup, but.
**Brian.hammond**: Okay, that makes sense to me now.
**Ken.mathewson**: Yeah, just.
**Ken.mathewson**: Just a consumption value.
**Brian.hammond**: I guess.
**Brian.hammond**: While.
**Brian.hammond**: While we're on that topic, question for Joe.
**Brian.hammond**: How many of these systems do you have operating in the United States?
**Race.kangas**: Over 10.
**Race.kangas**: Maybe around 10.
**Race.kangas**: I don't know the exact number.
**Race.kangas**: I know there's probably at least.
**Race.kangas**: At least eight.
**Brian.hammond**: Okay, that's.
**Brian.hammond**: That's enough.
**Brian.hammond**: Do you know, have.
**Brian.hammond**: Have any of the other clients that you have installed this for installed any type of metering to be able to get a better idea of what the actual power consumption is of your system.
**Race.kangas**: As far as metering?
**Race.kangas**: I'm not that.
**Race.kangas**: I'm not sure, but we definitely have, you know, the power requirements for the system that have.
**Race.kangas**: Have been delivered.
**Race.kangas**: It's just a matter of where one of them is going to go.
**Race.kangas**: Everywhere else is going to stay the same.
**Race.kangas**: But they're all going to be 400 volts.
**Race.kangas**: I did confirm this week it's eight drops of four bolts.
**Brian.hammond**: Yeah.
**Brian.hammond**: And that information is great.
**Brian.hammond**: That helps us design our service inside all the feeders and stuff to your system.
**Brian.hammond**: And it's frankly the way we design our system.
**Brian.hammond**: But what the utility actually sees is often.
**Brian.hammond**: I don't want to say much different, but it's less than what we design for as an engineering firm and what you guys design for as.
**Brian.hammond**: As the vendor.
**Brian.hammond**: So I think that's more the information that Yusuke is.
**Brian.hammond**: Is trying to get a good idea of.
**Brian.hammond**: And it's tough for us to estimate that without.
**Brian.hammond**: It's tough for us to accurately estimate that without better real world data.
**Brian.hammond**: But really, it really comes down to Yusuke.
**Brian.hammond**: How.
**Brian.hammond**: How accurate?
**Brian.hammond**: Exotic.
**Brian.hammond**: Yeah, I.
**Brian.hammond**: I can't get you inaccurate, so I'll get you something.
**Ken.mathewson**: Yeah.
**Race.kangas**: I mean, yeah, it matters on how.
**Ken.mathewson**: Long you run it.
**Race.kangas**: You know, what's moving.
**Race.kangas**: I mean, it's.
**Race.kangas**: If you're just looking for how much power consumption it uses on a daily basis.
**Race.kangas**: I mean we can't.
**Race.kangas**: You know, because each system is unique.
**Race.kangas**: You know, it's not really.
**Race.kangas**: I don't know if that's a.
**Race.kangas**: I don't know if that's something that we can estimate.
**Brian.hammond**: The only way to really get that information.
**Brian.hammond**: If you wanted to be accurate, you said okay.
**Brian.hammond**: Would be to install metering on this system specifically and meter that over a 30 day period.
**Brian.hammond**: Would give you a good idea of what your true peak is.
**Brian.hammond**: But I'll put together a rough estimate based on what I've seen on other projects and send it over to you in the morning.
**Ken.mathewson**: Yeah.
**Ken.mathewson**: Very rough.
**Ken.mathewson**: Is okay.
**Ken.mathewson**: Just to, you know, understand how.
**Ken.mathewson**: How much.
**Ken.mathewson**: How much like approx.
**Ken.mathewson**: How much consumption will be added to the warehouse and that will be used to decide the insurance fee.
**Brian.hammond**: Insurance.
**Brian.hammond**: Okay.
**Ken.mathewson**: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Brian.hammond**: Okay.
**Brian.hammond**: Yeah, we can.
**Brian.hammond**: We can provide that.
**Brian.hammond**: If.
**Brian.hammond**: If you start.
**Brian.hammond**: I would just say don't.
**Brian.hammond**: Don't use that necessarily.
**Brian.hammond**: If you're trying to look at, you know, if I install solar, how much solar do I need?
**Brian.hammond**: If I need a generator to back it up, how much do I need?
**Brian.hammond**: We would want to do a more in depth analysis and have some better information if you wanted to go down that path.
**Brian.hammond**: But I think for insurance needs, a rough number would be good.
**Brian.hammond**: Would be sufficient.
**Ken.mathewson**: Yes, yes, yes.
**Ken.mathewson**: Okay.
**David.leddy**: Thank you.
**Ken.mathewson**: And you can share it to me tomorrow, right?
**Brian.hammond**: Yeah, yeah, I'll grab that probably first thing in the morning, if not this afternoon.
**Ken.mathewson**: Okay, okay.
**Ken.mathewson**: Understand.
**Ken.mathewson**: And Ahmed, I have a question.
**Ken.mathewson**: I sent email to Brandon this early this week that if any risks we have if we could not issue the PEO within this week.
**Ken.mathewson**: I see.
**Ken.mathewson**: I looped you in right as I remember.
**David.leddy**: This was yesterday or today.
**Ken.mathewson**: Like, like Monday or Monday or Tuesday?
**Bryan.wagar**: Monday or Tuesday?
**Bryan.wagar**: Wednesday.
**Bryan.wagar**: Brian, following up.
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay, now that's the electrical questions.
**Bryan.wagar**: I'm sorry if I.
**Bryan.wagar**: If I missed it.
**David.leddy**: I was traveling on Monday.
**Bryan.wagar**: But let me just go back Monday, 9:21pm no, that's to Brian.
**Ken.mathewson**: I think Sunday in US.
**Ken.mathewson**: Oh, Sunday midnight, I guess.
**Bryan.wagar**: Please be requested to discuss about the power drops.
**Bryan.wagar**: No, that's not it.
**Bryan.wagar**: That's Monday.
**Bryan.wagar**: No, I don't have anything from Sunday from you.
**Bryan.wagar**: Hi.
**Bryan.wagar**: @ Brandon.
**Bryan.wagar**: Please be confirmed what will be the effects.
**Bryan.wagar**: Oh, here it is.
**Bryan.wagar**: It was Monday at 1am or 1:51am yeah, please be confirmed that will be the effects.
**Bryan.wagar**: If we delayed the PO issuance April 25 instead of the 18th for the schedule point of view, we are heading for permission to do beyond the 21st.
**Ken.mathewson**: Right now.
**Ken.mathewson**: We are.
**Ken.mathewson**: I'm not sure we can like do the contract within this week.
**Ken.mathewson**: We're trying to.
**Ken.mathewson**: Trying to rush it, but I'm not sure what will be the potential, you know, risks if we delay.
**Ken.mathewson**: The PO Insurance cannot do it within this week.
**Bryan.wagar**: I'm texting him right now to be able to proceed with permitting.
**David.leddy**: You're just worried if he's going to still continue permitting, right?
**Ken.mathewson**: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Ken.mathewson**: Permitting.
**Ken.mathewson**: Permitting.
**Ken.mathewson**: I don't think any issue on permitting.
**Ken.mathewson**: They.
**Ken.mathewson**: I think they won't stop, I believe.
**Ken.mathewson**: But yeah, just to make sure.
**Brian.hammond**: What.
**Ken.mathewson**: Kind of risk we have if we could not finalize the PEO issuance within this week.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yes, we will still get everything printed and submitted.
**Bryan.wagar**: What about materials?
**Bryan.wagar**: Materials?
**Bryan.wagar**: Will you be able to proceed?
**Bryan.wagar**: So he said regarding permitting?
**Bryan.wagar**: Yes, he will continue.
**Bryan.wagar**: He will proceed with permitting.
**Bryan.wagar**: He's getting on a plane, so he's trying to text as fast as possible and he's texting.
**David.leddy**: He's writing right now.
**David.leddy**: I'll let you know in a sec.
**David.leddy**: I mean, well, you took.
**David.leddy**: In the meantime while we're waiting for.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Brandon, do we still need Henderson or Joseph?
**Joseph.burdzy**: Currently?
**Joseph.burdzy**: I just don't hold them up if.
**Bryan.wagar**: We don't need them at this time.
**Bryan.wagar**: Suka.
**Ken.mathewson**: Oh, sorry, I was muted.
**Ken.mathewson**: Brian or Joseph or Luther or Jesse?
**Ken.mathewson**: Do you have any topics to discuss with this team?
**Brian.hammond**: No, I think we're.
**Brian.hammond**: I think we're pretty good for.
**Brian.hammond**: For today.
**Brian.hammond**: We're getting that permit Set over to Ahmed so we can get this issued to the dob.
**Brian.hammond**: And looking forward to get into the CA process and watching this thing get constructed for y'all.
**Race.kangas**: Yeah, all good over here too.
**David.leddy**: Awesome.
**Ken.mathewson**: Thank you, guys.
**Ken.mathewson**: Sorry, do you have any question to engineering team?
**Ken.mathewson**: Exotic team?
**Brian.hammond**: Okay.
**Ken.mathewson**: Thank you.
**Ken.mathewson**: Okay.
**Ken.mathewson**: Yeah.
**Ken.mathewson**: Thank you very much.
**Ken.mathewson**: And Ahmed, we can just.
**David.leddy**: Yeah, we'll hang back.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah.
**Bryan.wagar**: The sprinkler.
**Bryan.wagar**: The sprinkler head count.
**Bryan.wagar**: Head count will be included.
**Bryan.wagar**: Included in the permit set issuance with the hydraulic.
**Bryan.wagar**: Come on, Hydra.
**Bryan.wagar**: Hydraulic calculations.
**Bryan.wagar**: That would be sufficient.
**Bryan.wagar**: Heads won't be an issue.
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay.
**Bryan.wagar**: Not till the drawings are finalized, but once they are, then yes.
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay.
**David.leddy**: So Yusuke, just one thing to push hard on your end for ex.
**David.leddy**: For exotic to finalize everything.
**David.leddy**: Because he's saying not till the drawings are finalized, but once they are, then yes, but we have to build the fabrication drawings first for the sprinkler heads.
**David.leddy**: Won't be an issue.
**David.leddy**: Just need the final count.
**David.leddy**: So I told him that the sprinkler head counts will be included in the permit set issuance along with the hydraulic calculations.
**David.leddy**: Wouldn't that be sufficient?
**David.leddy**: He said yes, it would be good for the heads.
**David.leddy**: We will need the cads so we can do the fabrication drawings and that and get that ordered.
**Bryan.wagar**: Perfect.
**Bryan.wagar**: I will request DWGs.
**Bryan.wagar**: Request DWGs from Henderson, AUE and Exotech in the meantime.
**Joseph.burdzy**: All right.
**David.leddy**: So my homework is to gather DWGS for Brandon.
**Joseph.burdzy**: But once I get in the DWGS and he has the permit set, he'll have the.
**David.leddy**: The full set in a link as well.
**Joseph.burdzy**: He can start with fabrication drawings for the sprinkler system and whatnot.
**Joseph.burdzy**: But he's saying no, there's no issues with proceeding even though the PO is not issued.
**Ken.mathewson**: Okay.
**Ken.mathewson**: Okay.
**Bryan.wagar**: All right.
**Ken.mathewson**: Yeah, but please let him know that we're trying to do the PO within this week.
**Ken.mathewson**: But if it's not possible, we can continue Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday.
**Bryan.wagar**: Hard to x to issue a PO this week.
**Bryan.wagar**: If not, it's happening on Monday or Tuesday.
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay.
**Ken.mathewson**: Yeah.
**Ken.mathewson**: As soon as possible.
**Bryan.wagar**: No, I gotcha.
**Ken.mathewson**: And what about the fabrication drawing starts?
**Ken.mathewson**: What.
**Ken.mathewson**: What is the.
**Joseph.burdzy**: So he needs the.
**Joseph.burdzy**: He needs the autocad drawings.
**Joseph.burdzy**: So then he can share that with like the sprinkler subcontractor that needs to now size the pipe.
**David.leddy**: Like.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Like design the pipes, the fittings, everything.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Like, he'll have shop drawings for that.
**Joseph.burdzy**: They will also be signed and sealed.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Henderson will review.
**Joseph.burdzy**: TPG will just review for architectural purposes.
**Joseph.burdzy**: And then it just goes straight back to the gc.
**Joseph.burdzy**: They order, they build and then they submit those drawings at the end of the project to the DoB.
**Ken.mathewson**: So right now Aliato have to prepare the shop drawing revision zero or something.
**Ken.mathewson**: And they will submit to Henderson to check if their shop drawing is okay.
**Ken.mathewson**: And if it is approved by Henderson, Eliato could start ordering the pipe.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah.
**Joseph.burdzy**: One question for you that I'm now thinking about it for some reason.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Does Marianne need to review any sprinkler shop drawings as well?
**Ken.mathewson**: The landlord side?
**Joseph.burdzy**: Yeah.
**Ken.mathewson**: Marianne not sure.
**Ken.mathewson**: Brian, do you have any idea?
**Ken.mathewson**: Do we have to like that.
**Ken.mathewson**: That's good.
**Ken.mathewson**: Landlord.
**Brian.hammond**: That's.
**Brian.hammond**: That's a.
**Brian.hammond**: That depends on your contract with your landlord.
**Brian.hammond**: So I.
**Brian.hammond**: I can't really answer that question.
**Brian.hammond**: If.
**Brian.hammond**: If they.
**Brian.hammond**: If their contract states that any modifications to building systems are required to be reviewed by them, then yes.
**Brian.hammond**: If they don't, if there's nothing, no kind of clauses in your contract like that, if you guys have full ownership and not ownership, but full.
**Brian.hammond**: The green light from.
**Brian.hammond**: From them to make any modifications necessary within the building, then I would say no.
**Brian.hammond**: But you'd have to ask them or review with your legal team.
**Ken.mathewson**: Okay.
**Joseph.burdzy**: I think.
**Joseph.burdzy**: I think Yasuke, it's a question definitely to ask just to see if.
**Joseph.burdzy**: So then when we do schedule these shutoffs, they are aware of what kind of work we're doing and it's up to whatever standards they want.
**Joseph.burdzy**: I think.
**Joseph.burdzy**: I think that would.
**Joseph.burdzy**: That would be a good confirmation just to, you know, cover.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Cover all aspects.
**Ken.mathewson**: Okay.
**Ken.mathewson**: Ahmed, can you.
**Ken.mathewson**: Can you support this one?
**Ken.mathewson**: Can you ask them?
**Joseph.burdzy**: You want me to send the email?
**Joseph.burdzy**: Yeah, I could send an email.
**Ken.mathewson**: Yeah.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Yeah, I could do that.
**Ken.mathewson**: Yeah.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, for sure.
**David.leddy**: I'll do that.
**Joseph.burdzy**: I'll do that right after this call.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Hey, Jesse, how are you?
**Ken.mathewson**: Okay.
**Brian.hammond**: Hi.
**John.min**: I'm good.
**John.min**: I'm sorry I joined in late here.
**John.min**: I think Brandon's on a plane right now.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Yeah, I've been texting him back and forth, but.
**Joseph.burdzy**: What we were just asking Brandon the question about the contract.
**Joseph.burdzy**: So we know that the PO is not.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Not super delayed, but instead of like issuing the PO on the 18th, the team is looking at potentially the 25th.
**Joseph.burdzy**: I believe the 25th is next Friday.
**Joseph.burdzy**: But he's trying to iron it out to be sooner or later.
**Joseph.burdzy**: So like, Yusuke is pushing as much as possible to get it done by Tuesday, Wednesday.
**Ken.mathewson**: Ish.
**Joseph.burdzy**: So we were just wondering if we gather all of the DWGs from all consultants.
**Joseph.burdzy**: We get you the permit sets, which has all the accurate number of heads, it has all the Pipe size.
**Joseph.burdzy**: It has all the electrical requirements.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Would we be able to proceed with ordering materials or going into shop drawings?
**Joseph.burdzy**: I'm sorry, jumping right into procurement.
**John.min**: Yeah, absolutely.
**Bryan.wagar**: Awesome.
**John.min**: We'll get those.
**John.min**: And then we have a guy and just a couple hours away, we're doing another project.
**John.min**: I don't know if Brandon mentioned that.
**Bryan.wagar**: He did, yeah.
**John.min**: Did he give you the address where to send?
**Joseph.burdzy**: No, but I know it's somewhere.
**Joseph.burdzy**: I think it's in pa, right?
**John.min**: Yeah, it's in here.
**John.min**: Burn Bill, Pennsylvania.
**John.min**: So we can get you that address to send the plans to and he can get them into the permit office.
**David.leddy**: Or did you give me that address?
**Joseph.burdzy**: Oh, yeah.
**Joseph.burdzy**: So he did give me that address.
**John.min**: Okay.
**David.leddy**: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Joseph.burdzy**: So I plan on shipping everything, hopefully tomorrow.
**Joseph.burdzy**: And I believe your team will be plotting Exotics Team.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Exotics team's drawings.
**John.min**: Okay.
**John.min**: And is.
**John.min**: So those electrical revisions, we'll get them to our electrician then.
**John.min**: And we're proceeding with those drawings.
**David.leddy**: Yeah.
**Joseph.burdzy**: So you'll.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Well, the one thing that's missing, and we issued a sketch yesterday, is the locations of the remaining quads, but we kind of reduced them into duplexes.
**Joseph.burdzy**: So those are supposed to fall somewhere within the skypath area where the outbound products go.
**Joseph.burdzy**: So within that area there'll be like four scattered duplexes.
**Joseph.burdzy**: And then we owe you a location for three more.
**Joseph.burdzy**: And we'll try to keep them within the same vicinity.
**Joseph.burdzy**: So then it doesn't really impact anything with regards to cost and whatnot.
**Joseph.burdzy**: But I had a quick discussion with Brandon with regards to that.
**John.min**: Okay.
**Joseph.burdzy**: But tomorrow we should have a link for everyone.
**Joseph.burdzy**: And I'll send it, of course, to your team and then also to Yusuke, also send it to the landlord so she has a final copy of all the drawings.
**Joseph.burdzy**: And then I'll also then ask her that question.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Yasuke, regarding submission of the subcontractors shop drawing for the sprinkler and then Jesse, for your team, whenever we start ironing out some dates, just with regards to shut offs, I think Yusuke, Marianne said one week notice or two weeks notice.
**David.leddy**: Marianne said what I think didn't Marianne said to.
**Joseph.burdzy**: To just let the.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Let them know when we would like to schedule shut offs and whether it's going to be on the weekend or during the week, we have to give her like a heads up.
**John.min**: And what we can do is when we, you know, we're working with the schedule, we can do milestones in there for when we anticipate shutdowns to occur.
**John.min**: So like throughout the job, they would have Kind of a general overview.
**John.min**: And then if they need a week or two, because you know, schedules move a day or two here all, all the time.
**John.min**: So then we could just follow up, make sure they know two weeks ahead of it.
**John.min**: When we get it, maybe it's a week ahead.
**John.min**: That'd be ideal to give us.
**John.min**: We could to schedule those and let them know that's not a problem.
**Bryan.wagar**: Awesome.
**Bryan.wagar**: Awesome.
**Ken.mathewson**: Okay.
**Bryan.wagar**: All right, let's go.
**David.leddy**: Oh, and Jesse, just so you're.
**David.leddy**: I'm sorry.
**Bryan.wagar**: Go ahead.
**Bryan.wagar**: Sorry.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Go ahead, Jesse.
**Joseph.burdzy**: So once, once you're going to have the link to the drawings that will be that.
**Joseph.burdzy**: That will enable you to at least price start like the shop drawings for like all the conduits, all the piping, all the sprinkler heads and whatnot.
**Joseph.burdzy**: The only thing that's going to be ironed out in a bulletin issuance is those convenience outlets.
**Joseph.burdzy**: So we'll try to get that out to you guys as soon as possible.
**Joseph.burdzy**: But you guys can at least start working off of those drawings and then we'll iron out those drops.
**Joseph.burdzy**: You guys can at least use the sketch that we issued with the low, the approximate locations just until the skypath area is fully ironed out and we know exactly where these printers will fall.
**John.min**: Yeah, we could just have them add a note, field coordinate, exact location.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Got it.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Okay, well, deal.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Alrighty.
**Ken.mathewson**: Okay.
**Ken.mathewson**: Okay.
**Ken.mathewson**: And one thing I want to confirm is that last week Joseph shared exotics overall schedule for construction installation schedule to Brandon.
**Ken.mathewson**: And I think Brandon is trying to include Eliato's construction schedule into the exotic construction schedule and share it.
**John.min**: That's correct.
**John.min**: Yep.
**John.min**: Brandon's working on that.
**Ken.mathewson**: Okay.
**Ken.mathewson**: Okay, can I know when we can have that schedule from Brandon?
**John.min**: I'll follow up with him.
**Ken.mathewson**: Sure.
**John.min**: I'll talk to him whenever he.
**John.min**: He lands and I just see.
**John.min**: But we, we talked about that today before.
**John.min**: It.
**John.min**: I just.
**John.min**: He didn't tell me when it would be done.
**Ken.mathewson**: Okay.
**Ken.mathewson**: Okay.
**Ken.mathewson**: But basically I want Eliato to start construction from June.
**Ken.mathewson**: So like 1st or 2nd or 3rd of June and wanted to, you know, I want to be there at site first week of the June.
**John.min**: Okay.
**Ken.mathewson**: When Eliato come to mobilize and start working.
**John.min**: Okay.
**John.min**: Is there, are they.
**John.min**: Have they started, you know, all the work they're doing for the leveling and not that we don't have a lot of work, it doesn't have anything to do with that area.
**John.min**: But are they going to be there at the same time?
**John.min**: Well, aren't they checking the levelness of the floors and then doing some MITIGATION in certain areas.
**Ken.mathewson**: Yes.
**Ken.mathewson**: S.
**Ken.mathewson**: Doing the leveling survey will be finishing in May, like early May.
**Ken.mathewson**: So.
**John.min**: Okay.
**Ken.mathewson**: And remediation will be early in June too.
**John.min**: Okay.
**John.min**: Was that something.
**John.min**: And so that's something too.
**John.min**: We can add to this schedule if you give us those dates, and you can have one comprehensive schedule for everything.
**Ken.mathewson**: Okay.
**Ken.mathewson**: Okay.
**Ken.mathewson**: Right now I can just say starting the floor survey in 1st of May and starting the floor remediation, like 2nd of June, something like that.
**Ken.mathewson**: Yeah.
**Ken.mathewson**: And actually, I mean, I'm in Japan now and I'm trying to visit us from end of this month to June 5th.
**Ken.mathewson**: So I want to make sure that all the construction going well or mobilized correctly during my stay in US So.
**Ken.mathewson**: Yeah, so I want you to start coming mobilization to warehouse end of May to June 1st or something, or second.
**Ken.mathewson**: And I want to see some kind of, you know, working well from June 2nd to June 5th.
**Ken.mathewson**: Okay, that.
**Ken.mathewson**: That's my plan right now.
**John.min**: All right, you got it.
**Brian.hammond**: You got.
**John.min**: Have you been to this area before?
**John.min**: This particular area over the warehouse?
**Ken.mathewson**: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I do several times.
**Ken.mathewson**: Yes.
**John.min**: Okay.
**Joseph.burdzy**: I get lost every time I go there.
**David.leddy**: But yes.
**John.min**: Before you get to the warehouse or into the warehouse, it's like.
**Joseph.burdzy**: It takes me from the back end, unless it takes me from the front where Chick Fil A is on that one road.
**Joseph.burdzy**: It's easy.
**Joseph.burdzy**: But then for some reason it takes me around a wraparound and then I go in between houses, and then I end up asking questions to every resident.
**David.leddy**: That'S in the area.
**John.min**: Yeah, well, that's the difference.
**John.min**: Like, I grew up in Nebraska.
**John.min**: Everything's flat.
**John.min**: All the roads are 1 mile squares, north and south, east and west.
**John.min**: Then you go to a state like South Carolina.
**John.min**: There's not a straight road in that state.
**Bryan.wagar**: You know, so I went to.
**David.leddy**: I went to college in Dubai.
**David.leddy**: So it's.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Dubai is like one flat area as well.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Basically, it's just all new highways, all new lakes and whatnot.
**Joseph.burdzy**: But it's all flat.
**Joseph.burdzy**: So.
**Joseph.burdzy**: And the highway is straight.
**David.leddy**: One shot.
**Joseph.burdzy**: It's like a.
**David.leddy**: You don't.
**Joseph.burdzy**: And you can go 150 miles or I'm sorry, 150 kilometers per hour.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Yeah.
**Bryan.wagar**: And.
**Joseph.burdzy**: And when I came back to Jersey and New York, it was just waves on waves on waves on waves.
**David.leddy**: And it was just a hard adaption.
**John.min**: Yes, yes.
**John.min**: Yep.
**John.min**: Yeah, they got like.
**John.min**: If you hop to Wyoming, the speed limit is whatever.
**John.min**: Safe.
**John.min**: That's what they put on there.
**Brian.hammond**: You feel safe driving.
**John.min**: There's no one to run into but yourself.
**David.leddy**: Yusuke, were you going to say something.
**Ken.mathewson**: So, Jesse, please tell Brandon about my schedule and please try to share us combined schedule.
**John.min**: Yep, yep, we're working on it.
**John.min**: We'll get that to you.
**John.min**: I'll let him know you're planning to get there early May and stay through the 5th of June and expect to see some.
**John.min**: Some work in progress.
**Ken.mathewson**: Yes.
**John.min**: When we get out of here.
**Ken.mathewson**: Yes, yes.
**Ken.mathewson**: Yes.
**Ken.mathewson**: Yeah.
**Ken.mathewson**: Yeah.
**John.min**: I'm looking forward to it.
**John.min**: It's going to be good.
**Ken.mathewson**: Yeah.
**Ken.mathewson**: Thank you.
**Joseph.burdzy**: All right, guys, anybody will open the floor.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Anybody have any questions, comments or concerns?
**Ken.mathewson**: I'm good.
**John.min**: And I'm sorry I'm.
**John.min**: I joined late, but just to wrap up, you're sending a link.
**John.min**: All the drawings.
**John.min**: We're going to get them plotted and printed and taken into the building department.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Yep.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Well, no, I'm.
**Joseph.burdzy**: I'm shipping out TPGs, Henderson's and AUE's drawings already signed and sealed and plotted.
**Joseph.burdzy**: You're only plotting exotext drawings that they issued last week.
**John.min**: Okay.
**Joseph.burdzy**: But regardless, I'll send you a full link tomorrow with those drawings as well.
**Joseph.burdzy**: So you can just take their drawings and I'll tell you.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Plot this one in a folder for you.
**David.leddy**: Okay.
**Bryan.wagar**: All right.
**Joseph.burdzy**: All right.
**Bryan.wagar**: Awesome.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Okay, I will request the DWGS right.
