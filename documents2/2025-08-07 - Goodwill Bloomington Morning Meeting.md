## Transcript
**Jcurtin**: Morning, Jesse.
**Jdawson**: Morning.
**Jcurtin**: Guess Nick got in late last night, so he didn't know if he was joining or not.
**Jdawson**: Oh, he's back here today.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: Hello.
**Bclymer**: Morning, y'.
**Bclymer**: alleatogroup.
**Jcurtin**: Morning, Jack.
**Bclymer**: Hey, Jack.
**Jcurtin**: Hey.
**Jcurtin**: Well, Nick got in late, so he will be not joining us this morning.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: For messaged me earlier.
**Jcurtin**: I guess he got in late.
**Jcurtin**: Maybe his flight was delayed or something.
**Bclymer**: Alrighty.
**Jcurtin**: So we worked out at the loading dock area.
**Jcurtin**: Is there any other issues to deal with on that?
**Jcurtin**: We got the RFI sent it off to the sub.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Thinking ahead here, when SC Fab comes back and they have to do some welding.
**Bclymer**: I'm trying to understand.
**Bclymer**: I just.
**Bclymer**: Unfortunately I have to ask.
**Bclymer**: Ask the question.
**Bclymer**: But I'd rather ask it than pretend to know.
**Bclymer**: I'm trying to understand what SC FAB has to do as far as welding for the reinforcing at the CMU wall.
**Bclymer**: This is.
**Jcurtin**: Well, they gotta weld the embed plate to the beam like the beams they provided.
**Jcurtin**: They provide the embeds.
**Jcurtin**: Mason puts the embeds in, set the beam, and then they got to go in and weld it to the embed.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So they're welding the embed to the beam.
**Jcurtin**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Now, is this is the beam being welded at all to the.
**Bclymer**: To the deck or.
**Jcurtin**: Well, the beam that goes up to the bar joist like that embed was previously welded to the embed.
**Jcurtin**: So now they got to cut that off and weld it to the beam.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: alleatogroup right.
**Bclymer**: So there's just a.
**Bclymer**: There's a slight discrepancy that I have to talk with.
**Bclymer**: With Nick about.
**Bclymer**: Because we've had.
**Bclymer**: So once this wall gets finished, we have more floor angle that needs to be installed around here, which SC FAB has in their contract to do.
**Bclymer**: But any.
**Bclymer**: Any extra mobilization.
**Bclymer**: Nick was saying they give a pretty hefty charge.
**Bclymer**: So to avoid a.
**Bclymer**: To avoid having them having to come back out, Nick and I were thinking to have Glenmark do the welding because they've had a welder on site that have done other items for us.
**Bclymer**: But if SC FAB has to come back anyways to do this floor angle, I'm trying to figure out, like, do I just have Glenmark do this welding and then wait to do SC Fab once all this floor angle is ready to be shot.
**Bclymer**: So then like.
**Bclymer**: Because when they.
**Bclymer**: If I have SC FAB come out here and weld this, the flooring won't be completely ready to shoot by the time I need this welded.
**Bclymer**: So then that will make.
**Jcurtin**: What are they doing to the floor Angle.
**Jcurtin**: I thought they bolted it all down.
**Bclymer**: Yes, they.
**Bclymer**: They have more to bolt down once this wall is done.
**Bclymer**: So they already have to come out and make a second trip for that.
**Jcurtin**: So why can't they do everything at that point?
**Jcurtin**: I don't think it's going to go anywhere, but unless they can't access it once you put the finishes on the outside.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I mean, I guess I can just have them come.
**Bclymer**: I'll plan it where the welding will take place at the same time that we shoot all this angle.
**Bclymer**: I just have to have the floor finished back here.
**Bclymer**: So like this, this will be set and then probably be sitting for a couple days until we can get the concrete floor finished in.
**Jcurtin**: Jesse, what are your thoughts?
**Jdawson**: Is that guy that's on site a certified structural welder?
**Bclymer**: He's welded the roof hatch for us and he welded a lintel up above the donation entry.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: I don't think either one of those requires structural certification.
**Jdawson**: I would find that out first before you ask him to do something structural.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So they will use.
**Bclymer**: We will use this wall as a shoring mechanism to hold up the joist right here.
**Bclymer**: Because that's.
**Bclymer**: That's from my understanding.
**Bclymer**: And then he'll still come and tooth in all this lentil right here.
**Bclymer**: See?
**Bclymer**: I guess all that got figured out.
**Jcurtin**: There.
**Bclymer**: Right now I don't really have any other extended questions.
**Bclymer**: Just a heads up.
**Bclymer**: I'm hoping we don't hit a major speed bump with the electrical finishing out devising and he still has to rough in at the dock leveler pit.
**Bclymer**: The current electrician that I have out.
**Bclymer**: Out on site, he may be let go from Dean today for calling a co worker of his.
**Bclymer**: I guess the co worker called hr.
**Bclymer**: So he's got to meet with HR today and if he gets let go, Dean will have to then supply another electrician to me.
**Jcurtin**: He should be given a medal for that.
**Jdawson**: The hurt feelings report.
**Bclymer**: It was very surprising because long story short, the co worker he called retarded was his Cousin's son, that's 18, fresh out of high school.
**Bclymer**: And he helped him get a job and he was kind of being, you know, one of those like being hard on the apprentice kind of things.
**Bclymer**: And mason ran into a paint bucket in the backside and you know, of the.
**Bclymer**: In the receiving area and it just told him, you know, get your head out of your ass.
**Bclymer**: Quit being a.
**Bclymer**: And then, then Mason went out to the truck and called HR and left the site.
**Jdawson**: He won't be coming back anytime soon.
**Bclymer**: No, no.
**Bclymer**: The.
**Bclymer**: The younger ones these teams definitely put them on a different job site and we'll find out if Kevin is let go or not.
**Bclymer**: From from from Dame just just for that other than that I had the Dropbox dropped off yesterday.
**Bclymer**: We have reviewed it with rock solid.
**Bclymer**: I believe he should be giving Nick a price real here shortly.
**Bclymer**: When we were out here walking the dock door area we also all of us reviewed where we're going to put the donation Dropbox again other than that that's all I did.
**Jdawson**: You grab some good pictures Mr. Day.
**Bclymer**: Jack.
**Jdawson**: Of the the areas we talked about?
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Jcurtin**: Cool.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Can you let me know when you got those in the drive?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: Awesome.
**Jdawson**: Thank you.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, of course.
**Jdawson**: We got another huddle meeting we got to jump to but give me a holler if I can help with anything in the meantime.
**Bclymer**: Awesome.
**Jcurtin**: I appreciate it certainly.
**Jdawson**: Thank you Jack.
**Bclymer**: alleatogroup right.
**Bclymer**: Thanks John.
**Jcurtin**: Thanks.
