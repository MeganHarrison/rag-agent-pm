**Mparsons**: So.
**Speaker 2**: This pathway.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Kmass**: Yep.
**Kmass**: So I've been in the field for about four or five minutes.
**Kmass**: There he is.

**Kmass**: Gotcha.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: All right, cool.
**Kmass**: What's going on, man?
**Mparsons**: Man, nothing much.
**Mparsons**: Just getting.
**Mparsons**: Getting going here on a Monday.
**Kmass**: Yeah, this is Kevin.
**Kmass**: Kevin, this is Mike.
**Speaker 2**: Hey, Mike.
**Mparsons**: What's up, man?
**Mparsons**: What's up?
**Kmass**: All right, so he's gonna be.
**Kmass**: He's going to be the PM for us on this.
**Kmass**: All right.
**Mparsons**: All right.
**Kmass**: So just kind of starting with him this morning.
**Kmass**: He doesn't have a computer yet, so kind of just running through some of the stuff, the Exotech system, our scopes of work and kind of what's going on with those.
**Kmass**: I'm going to run out to Best Buy here in a little bit and get him a computer.
**Kmass**: And then I think he's going to start working on submittals.
**Kmass**: Right.
**Kmass**: So he'll start looking into those, making sure we're good there.
**Kmass**: And now I know you're working on a few things as well, right?
**Mparsons**: Yeah.
**Mparsons**: So I cc'd you on the email I sent this morning to Dual Temp regarding that floor sink.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: Yeah, yeah.
**Mparsons**: Just making sure that, that, you know, if they said yeah.
**Mparsons**: And then Tim, with Dean for Electrical, he hasn't been like, he just can't give me durations or lead time on materials.
**Mparsons**: So I asked them who they're ordering from.
**Kmass**: Yeah.
**Mparsons**: And that is CED Electrical.
**Mparsons**: So I started reaching out to them Friday.
**Mparsons**: Followed up this morning with another.
**Mparsons**: With another guy from there.
**Mparsons**: Just because the only, the only two, the transformers and the panel boards are what we need the lead times for.
**Mparsons**: And those, those.
**Mparsons**: And those are probably.
**Mparsons**: They're definitely going to be the longest.
**Kmass**: Yeah.
**Kmass**: Right.
**Mparsons**: So I'm hoping to get that answer here, you know, early.
**Mparsons**: So that's where we're on that.
**Mparsons**: I haven't even had time to really go over your electrical submittal review and just, I just, you know, I would like to just go through it and see what you saw and, you know, see if anything else sticks out.
**Kmass**: So what I think what we can do Is we'll let.
**Kmass**: We can also let Khabib take a look at it once we get him up on a computer.
**Kmass**: And then we can maybe all get together tomorrow on it.
**Mparsons**: Yeah.
**Kmass**: Put our heads together, make sure we're good on.
**Kmass**: So I'm looking at your.
**Kmass**: Your email here with the panel board and transformer stuff.
**Kmass**: So that looks good.
**Kmass**: We'll just see if he gets us back to us here today or tomorrow.
**Kmass**: If not, then we'll just keep working on him.
**Kmass**: So like you were saying, obviously electrical.
**Kmass**: Those two things are probably the longest lead times.
**Kmass**: I would agree with him on that.
**Kmass**: So we're just trying to track that down from these guys Deem electric is who we're using.
**Kmass**: And then here is our plumbing submittal.
**Kmass**: So we kind of went through plumbing looks pretty good except for the floor sink.
**Kmass**: The flange where the connection needs to be looks different than what exotech is requiring us to basically install.
**Kmass**: So it could be just a field thing where they just need to purchase a.
**Kmass**: A different flange that will make the connection.
**Kmass**: Should be pretty simple.
**Kmass**: But we just want to make sure we cover our bases on it and they know that it's.
**Kmass**: It does not match.
**Kmass**: All right, gotcha.
**Kmass**: So that's kind of where that's at.
**Mparsons**: Is there any update on fits?
**Kmass**: No, there's not.
**Kmass**: So like I was telling you all the back and forth with the fence, currently we're waiting on a new pricing for the eight foot fence from our fence company, which is pro max fence.
**Kmass**: And we have not seen that come through.
**Kmass**: It's been back and forth with them.
**Kmass**: Arbor fence.
**Speaker 2**: What's this for?
**Mparsons**: Because I know once we get a, you know, a date on that, that'll be my cue to go ahead and get out there.
**Kmass**: Yeah.
**Kmass**: And just so you know, Mike, if.
**Kmass**: If it's too expensive, I know the original quote for the 6 foot was like 15k and then we jumped to 50k for the 10 foot.
**Kmass**: So.
**Kmass**: And talking with Brandon and Jesse, if I.
**Kmass**: I don't know what their cap price is on that, but it may be a thing where I'm coming out with you on site.
**Kmass**: And that might be something we're installing with a couple of temp laborers, you know.
**Mparsons**: Yeah.
**Mparsons**: Yeah.
**Kmass**: So it looks like we kind of have pricing to get that started as far as what we're going to do with it if we do it in house.
**Kmass**: But we'll see what comes up with promax fence.
**Kmass**: Hopefully hoping it's not too high and we can make that work.
**Mparsons**: And I.
**Mparsons**: I know you know Brandon's been trying to nail down this schedule.
**Kmass**: Yeah.
**Mparsons**: And so like what we have on there now, basically the whole month of June it is, you know that four remediation stuff we talked about.
**Kmass**: Right.
**Mparsons**: And we, we wanted to get plumbing in there as early as possible because that's obviously in a different section of the warehouse.
**Mparsons**: We wouldn't even be in their way, you know.
**Kmass**: Right.
**Mparsons**: And he, the guy from Dual Temp said July is going to be the earliest.
**Mparsons**: He was going off of old schedule.
**Mparsons**: I'm not sure when or who he got it from, but he was going, he was going off of August and I, I was like, I was like, okay, well we're looking at June and yeah, it's kind of hard.
**Mparsons**: I can understand why it's hard for him to jump from August to June.
**Mparsons**: So July is going to have to do.
**Kmass**: Right.
**Kmass**: But like you said, if we can work on him staying on them and maybe if he gets an opening we can maybe get him in there earlier for sure.
**Kmass**: Get that done and knocked out for us.
**Mparsons**: Right.
**Mparsons**: And we're looking at a 15 to 7 working day duration for plumbing.
**Kmass**: Okay, that's not too bad.
**Kmass**: Yeah.
**Kmass**: They're just cutting the floor up can.
**Kmass**: Making some connections and then covering it back up.
**Kmass**: So obviously there's a couple inspections in there with that.
**Kmass**: Right.
**Kmass**: I think there's just that I saw on the schedule.
**Kmass**: There was one.
**Kmass**: Yeah.
**Kmass**: Underground inspection.
**Kmass**: But we'll see about that.
**Kmass**: All right.
**Speaker 2**: Coordinatings.
**Mparsons**: Yeah.
**Mparsons**: And I guess the beginning of electric.
**Mparsons**: I mean what we have right now is, you know, the first, the first electrical job would be relocating those existing lights.
**Kmass**: Yep.
**Mparsons**: And right now we have it for, you know, mid June.
**Kmass**: Yeah.
**Mparsons**: But like I said, the Tim, the guy from Dean, he's just really not giving me like.
**Kmass**: Yeah.
**Kmass**: Information because that's something.
**Kmass**: If they can get in there earlier too and start that, that would be good.
**Mparsons**: Yeah.
**Mparsons**: And I know they want those approved submittals as soon as possible to, you know, really be able to give us that needed information.
**Kmass**: Gotcha.
**Kmass**: Okay, so then, then we should definitely try to get those finished up in the next day or two, hopefully by Wednesday then get those out.
**Mparsons**: I know we have our, our weekly Uniqlo meetings are set up for 5:30.
**Mparsons**: Wednesday.
**Kmass**: Wednesday, that's right.
**Mparsons**: Yeah.
**Kmass**: Have you been on those lately?
**Mparsons**: I've been on everyone the last few weeks.
**Mparsons**: Yeah.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: It's.
**Mparsons**: It's mainly just been Brandon going back and forth with the exotech guys and just kind of, you know, I've been just sitting in taking notes.
**Kmass**: Yep.
**Kmass**: Listening and letting them kind of coordinate some stuff.
**Mparsons**: Yeah, yeah.
**Kmass**: So like he was saying Wednesday, Right.
**Kmass**: Here's the meeting.
**Kmass**: So Brandon will probably have to send you an invite to that.
**Kmass**: That's just a quick little mean going over some stuff until we really start rolling with this, and then that'll be a reoccurring thing.
**Mparsons**: Yeah, you can probably.
**Mparsons**: You could probably ask Maria for that invite because she's been sending out the invites for that.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Kmass**: So Maria's kind of.
**Kmass**: I don't know her true position, but.
**Mparsons**: She kind of helps.
**Kmass**: She kind of helps with everything.
**Kmass**: Whatever.
**Kmass**: Whatever Brandon needs or anybody needs, you can go straight to her and she'll.
**Kmass**: She'll get it handled for us.
**Mparsons**: She was mostly my travel coordinator until I got my card.
**Kmass**: Yep.
**Kmass**: Yep.
**Kmass**: Yeah.
**Kmass**: So she's really helpful.
**Kmass**: All right, cool.
**Kmass**: I think that's.
**Kmass**: That's really it.
**Kmass**: You got anything else going on you need us to take a look at or you need any help with anything?
**Mparsons**: Possibly.
**Mparsons**: I'll go ahead and share.
**Mparsons**: Put this procurement log that I'm still working on in the.
**Mparsons**: The OneDrive.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: That's still pretty new to me, so I'm kind of teaching myself as I go.
**Kmass**: There you go.
**Mparsons**: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Mparsons**: But other than that, there's nothing I can really think of.
**Kmass**: Right.
**Kmass**: You got your feelers out on Dean for electrical.
**Kmass**: Just kind of waiting on that, obviously.
**Kmass**: It sounds like they're waiting on some information from us as far as just having the submittals approved, you know.
**Mparsons**: Yeah.
**Kmass**: And then plumbing should be pretty straightforward.
**Kmass**: We're just waiting on the flange.
**Mparsons**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Kmass**: And then fire sprinkler.
**Kmass**: That's.
**Kmass**: I was going over some of that with Brandon.
**Kmass**: We looked at our PO purchase order for that looks good.
**Kmass**: So, yeah, I think we're all right there as well.
**Kmass**: That one's pretty straightforward as far as what needs to be done.
**Kmass**: So have you done any procurement on the fire sprinkler?
**Mparsons**: No, I haven't.
**Mparsons**: I haven't.
**Mparsons**: I.
**Mparsons**: I don't even know.
**Mparsons**: I haven't even seen the fire sprinkler submittal.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Kmass**: And, yeah, I'll be honest, I haven't looked into it.
**Kmass**: So that's something I'll make sure I.
**Kmass**: I start looking into, too.
**Mparsons**: Yeah.
**Mparsons**: If you could share that with me, too, that'd be good.
**Kmass**: Yep.
**Kmass**: I'll get a link and I'll send it to you.
**Kmass**: Yeah.
**Kmass**: One thing, obviously, on the couple of that I've been and kind of helping with, it's always the sprinkler heads that are the issue.
**Kmass**: It Seems whether.
**Mparsons**: Yeah, I think on this one, we're gonna.
**Mparsons**: It's all one head.
**Mparsons**: It's the head that we use.
**Mparsons**: We just used in Burn Bill.
**Kmass**: Yeah.
**Mparsons**: So shouldn't be any issues there.
**Mparsons**: But of course, something.
**Mparsons**: Something will probably come up, but.
**Kmass**: Yeah.
**Kmass**: Yeah, I know.
**Kmass**: Like the one in Texas.
**Kmass**: It was.
**Kmass**: We had the full shipment, and then we didn't have the full shipment, and then we had to wait a little while for.
**Kmass**: To get the rest of them.
**Mparsons**: So, you know.
**Mparsons**: Yeah, we had a.
**Mparsons**: Up there in Burnville a couple weeks ago.
**Mparsons**: We had a code red.
**Mparsons**: Like, we're Had a hard deadline of finishing and having everything tested by Friday.
**Kmass**: Yeah.
**Mparsons**: We get to the end of the day, or we get to, like, midday on Wednesday.
**Mparsons**: We're about to, you know, have all these heads installed, and then the foreman hits me with, hey, we're running low on heads, so.
**Kmass**: Great.
**Mparsons**: So I had.
**Mparsons**: I was able to have.
**Mparsons**: But luckily, Alex was able to get those overnight shipped, and we were able to put them in Thursday morning and start testing.
**Mparsons**: So it worked out, but there you go.
**Kmass**: Nice.
**Kmass**: Yeah.
**Kmass**: So going forward, I think sprinkler, for some reason, sprinkler heads is a island.
**Kmass**: Not an issue, but can become an issue.
**Kmass**: All right.
**Kmass**: So that's just something we got to stay.
**Kmass**: Stay on top of.
**Speaker 2**: Okay.
**Kmass**: Especially the count and making sure the full amount is there.
**Kmass**: All right, cool.
**Kmass**: All right, Mike, if you ain't got anything else, we're going to take off and look into some other stuff, and we'll start working on some of this as well, all right?
**Mparsons**: Oh, yeah, we'll stay in touch.
**Kmass**: Absolutely.
**Kmass**: As soon as I see some of that stuff from fire sprinkler, I'll let you know.
**Kmass**: I'll send it to you.
**Mparsons**: Appreciate it.
**Kmass**: All right.
**Kmass**: Talk to you later.
**Kmass**: Bye.
**Kmass**: Take care.
