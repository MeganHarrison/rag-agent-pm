## Transcript
**Ataylor**: Just try to nail down where exactly y' all are trying to be.
**Jbower**: So do people.
**Jbower**: Do people pull around that back end at all?
**Ataylor**: Yeah, yeah.
**Ataylor**: So if you're looking at the bottom of that picture is the inbound side of the yard.
**Ataylor**: So.
**Ataylor**: And that.
**Ataylor**: That's the inbound side of the warehouse.
**Ataylor**: The opposite side on the top of the picture is outbound, but it's a one.
**Ataylor**: One way in, one way out on the inbound side of the yard.
**Ataylor**: So if it's an outbound driver, they're wrapping around the whole building, picking up their loads on the top of the page and then driving back around to the bottom.
**Jbower**: Mm.
**Ataylor**: That's that where the blue arrows are.
**Ataylor**: Or that's the main travel aisle for every outbound truck coming in and out of the gate.
**Jbower**: Right.
**Jbower**: So we'll be able to leave the travel aisle open.
**Jbower**: So you see where that X is?
**Speaker 2**: Mm.
**Jbower**: That's essentially where our crane will set.
**Jbower**: Now, it's a big enough crane where anything parked there will not be in the way.
**Jbower**: We'll be able to boom over.
**Jbower**: So assuming you know that that crane is not going to be more than, you know, 50 foot area, and I'll confirm with you guys, but you should still have that route to be able to go in and out of there.
**Jbower**: And we have flaggers there.
**Jbower**: And so it's, you know, I have guys on site.
**Jbower**: Charles will have guys on site.
**Jbower**: So there's a good picture.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, that's why I just wanted to pull up the Google Maps, but.
**Speaker 2**: So you're saying the crane will be right here?
**Jbower**: It won't be right next to the building?
**Jbower**: No, it's a big enough crane we got.
**Speaker 2**: So it'll be like, right here in this area.
**Jbower**: Yeah.
**Jbower**: We're going to get it as close as possible, right?
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, to the wall.
**Jbower**: And then trucks will still be able to move, you know, in and out of there.
**Jbower**: So if you pull up those.
**Jbower**: Those photos.
**Speaker 2**: Yep.
**Speaker 2**: Can do these ones.
**Jbower**: That dumpster.
**Jbower**: Hopefully that dumpster.
**Jbower**: Are trucks able to get by that dumpster?
**Ataylor**: They're driving around it right now.
**Ataylor**: It should be pushed over.
**Ataylor**: I don't know what's going on with.
**Jbower**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jbower**: I don't know whose that is.
**Jbower**: I don't.
**Speaker 2**: Might be Vargos.
**Speaker 2**: There's a good.
**Ataylor**: Blue.
**Ataylor**: It's probably theirs.
**Jbower**: Yeah.
**Jbower**: So we're gonna be staying in that general.
**Jbower**: You see where that red line is?
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, the fire lane.
**Jbower**: Yeah.
**Jbower**: Like I said, you know, this.
**Jbower**: This crane is mobile.
**Jbower**: So, like, we can work around what you guys have.
**Jbower**: But the key was getting a Big enough one, so you didn't have to move any trailers.
**Ataylor**: So what's the plan for tomorrow?
**Ataylor**: Just.
**Ataylor**: Just so I make sure, because I got a pretty lofty inbound load tomorrow, so I'm gonna have, you know, trucks in and out.
**Ataylor**: But what are y' all trying to accomplish tomorrow specifically?
**Jbower**: Essentially, it's just prepping and making sure, like, we, the guys know what's going on.
**Jbower**: And like I said, getting any cones on site, guys getting tools on site.
**Jbower**: I.
**Jbower**: I can get a better detailed list for you.
**Jbower**: Jacob.
**Jbower**: I'm not a crane.
**Jbower**: I'm not a crane expert.
**Jbower**: You know, I.
**Jbower**: I deal with them a lot, but I.
**Jbower**: And when it comes to prepping, you know, obviously I'm not the one prepping.
**Jbower**: So let me get with.
**Jbower**: With Charles.
**Jbower**: I'll get with the crane company.
**Jbower**: I can get you a better detailed list of what that.
**Jbower**: What that.
**Ataylor**: I'm just trying to see if there's going to be, you know, no.
**Ataylor**: No impact to operation to.
**Ataylor**: So that way, when I go, let the team here know, hey, expect this from 7 and noon tomorrow should be no impact.
**Ataylor**: And then, Kelly, I don't know if you're working with LP or if I need to follow up with Patrick to let him know, hey, expect these folks to come on site.
**Ataylor**: And I don't.
**Ataylor**: Lonnie's out of office today through the weekend, so I don't know who else we need to let know if people are gonna be on the roof and all that fun stuff.
**Jbower**: Let me.
**Jbower**: Let me just help you guys here, okay?
**Jbower**: Yeah, give me one second.
**Jbower**: I'm gonna see if he answers.
**Speaker 2**: Ready?
**Ataylor**: Also want to know, like, if you guys are setting out cones, saying, hey, this is where it's gonna go.
**Ataylor**: And then I got people saying, what the hell are these cones moving straight out the way?
**Ataylor**: You know.
**Jbower**: Charles just text me.
**Jbower**: He's in a meeting.
**Jbower**: But, I mean, it's always very clear to Rogers and the whole team.
**Jbower**: I try to make it as clear as possible.
**Jbower**: I need to know if operations are impacted.
**Jbower**: And I asked him that question when I had a call with him yesterday.
**Jbower**: There will be no impact.
**Jbower**: That.
**Jbower**: The most impact will be when, obviously when that crane is.
**Jbower**: Is.
**Jbower**: Is booming over and moving, we're gonna have guys around saying, you know, don't drive by right now.
**Jbower**: Right.
**Jbower**: And essentially, that's when the crane is moving from one side to the other.
**Jbower**: So it's really only five hours of crane time, Jacob.
**Jbower**: Five to six hours, we're thinking.
**Jbower**: And so it'll park in one spot and it'll be stationary.
**Jbower**: So obviously we'll be getting it in there through the gate.
**Jbower**: We'll park it in one spot, it'll be stationary.
**Jbower**: We'll boom over.
**Jbower**: We'll lift the rtu, remove the old curb, put the new curb in with the adapter, and then drop it down.
**Jbower**: And when that's done, they can unhook it, boom it back.
**Jbower**: And then now we're driving around to the other side and doing the same thing and we're done.
**Ataylor**: Gotcha.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Jbower**: So it's not like it's moving in and out.
**Jbower**: Like once it's there, it's there.
**Jbower**: So guys will be able to drive around it.
**Ataylor**: Okay, gotcha.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, we'll just want to coordinate any of that down like when you guys are mobile and we need to pause the trucks moving in and out, we're gonna have to coordinate with.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, inbound, outbound side because Mondays are our heaviest volume days.
**Ataylor**: So like there's going to be non stop trucks.
**Ataylor**: It'll be no problem just to pause for a minute, have them wait.
**Ataylor**: Doesn't sound like it's going to be too long to move it from one side to the right, but.
**Ataylor**: Okay, I, I will let the team here know there's going to be no impact tomorrow.
**Ataylor**: Kelly, I don't know who you need to reach out to from your end just to make sure they, you know, they let him in the gate and everybody's aware that needs to be there then.
**Jbower**: And Jacob and Kelly, I'm, I'm sending like my, my own guys out there.
**Speaker 2**: Okay.
**Jbower**: So you, so you don't have to have the headache.
**Jbower**: Obviously that's why you hired me to do this.
**Jbower**: So.
**Jbower**: Yeah, can.
**Jbower**: Is the man.
**Speaker 2**: Who is it?
**Jbower**: Camden Rusen.
**Jbower**: I think you may have met him, but.
**Speaker 2**: Camden or Camden?
**Speaker 2**: Camden.
**Jbower**: Camden.
**Jbower**: C A N D O N.
**Jbower**: Okay, perfect.
**Jbower**: He's flying out Sunday.
**Jbower**: He can't fly out Saturday.
**Jbower**: Okay, he's flying out Sunday and he'll be there.
**Jbower**: Guys will be starting to show up around 5:30 in the morning.
**Speaker 2**: Sunday morning on site with folks for this project.
**Speaker 2**: Okay.
**Speaker 2**: Monday at 5:30am Tomorrow.
**Speaker 2**: Tomorrow.
**Speaker 2**: Saturday.
**Speaker 2**: Can we get a list of names of folks that will be on site tomorrow?
**Jbower**: I'll get you a list of names.
**Speaker 2**: We will have folks on site to evaluate.
**Speaker 2**: Evaluate and ensure they have what they need for a successful modification.
**Jbower**: I'm.
**Jbower**: Oh man, I have so many buildings.
**Jbower**: Can you get to the roof from the inside or, or from the outside?
**Speaker 2**: No, it's from the inside.
**Jbower**: Only from the inside.
**Jbower**: So the only impact obviously with guys needing to be on the inside.
**Jbower**: Kelly and Jacob.
**Jbower**: Is them getting to the roof?
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Jbower**: Okay.
**Jbower**: Other than that, like a lot of tools and stuff.
**Jbower**: A lot of times they'll just from the outside.
**Speaker 2**: Right.
**Jbower**: But guys will need to.
**Jbower**: Obviously we're not lifting guys up there.
**Jbower**: So we'll be walking up that way.
**Jbower**: But other than that, you know, everything's outside and.
**Jbower**: And the biggest thing I.
**Jbower**: I'm telling Candon is be there for traffic control.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: Making sure access tomorrow.
**Speaker 2**: Sorry.
**Speaker 2**: Needed inside of the building is to access the ladder to the roof.
**Speaker 2**: Okay.
**Speaker 2**: Got that.
**Speaker 2**: And then I'm going to have you.
**Speaker 2**: I'm signing you up AJ to get us the list of names today.
**Jbower**: Yep.
**Speaker 2**: For tomorrow.
**Speaker 2**: Okay.
**Speaker 2**: And then Jacob, from your perspective, who should I add to this just for Monday with the.
**Speaker 2**: And I can be available at 5:30am too.
**Speaker 2**: That's no problem if anyone has any questions.
**Speaker 2**: But for like shipping and receiving to make sure they're looped in with that coordination in case we do need to like move trucks.
**Speaker 2**: Who.
**Speaker 2**: Who would be good for that for Monday morning?
**Ataylor**: Rob, what day is it?
**Ataylor**: Monday.
**Ataylor**: Monday's the 16th.
**Ataylor**: You want to go om route?
**Ataylor**: Probably.
**Ataylor**: I'll tab in Marcos Garcia.
**Ataylor**: He's kind of been my retrofit communication person.
**Speaker 2**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: He should be in early Monday and just have him coordinate on the inbound, outbound side.
**Ataylor**: I'll forward it to my managers as well.
**Speaker 2**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: But that way I have somebody that's, you know, can be a point of contact that I'll just loop in.
**Speaker 2**: Okay, perfect.
**Speaker 2**: I'm putting him on this one too.
**Speaker 2**: I said Marcos, adding you in for a point of contact to assist with the coordination if needed with trucks on Monday morning.
**Ataylor**: Add like with the schedulers and trucks.
**Ataylor**: That way he'll know it's.
**Speaker 2**: Yes, yes, yes, yes.
**Speaker 2**: Coordination if needed with the schedulers.
**Speaker 2**: With the schedulers.
**Speaker 2**: Schedulers.
**Speaker 2**: Okay.
**Speaker 2**: I will also be available via cell 513-283-1829.
**Speaker 2**: If you need anything at all or have any question.
**Ataylor**: And.
**Speaker 2**: And Canon will be on site.
**Jbower**: Yeah.
**Jbower**: And his last name is spelled.
**Jbower**: It's Rusin.
**Ataylor**: Are you.
**Jbower**: Yep.
**Jbower**: R U S I N.
**Jbower**: Okay.
**Speaker 2**: That's close.
**Speaker 2**: Ish.
**Speaker 2**: Okay.
**Jbower**: And he knows.
**Jbower**: I don't know.
**Jbower**: I mean he knows Michael Clay real well and.
**Speaker 2**: Okay.
**Jbower**: Canon super detail oriented.
**Jbower**: And he's.
**Jbower**: That's why I'm having him out there because he.
**Jbower**: He's gonna make your guys life a lot easier.
**Speaker 2**: Is he the one who we ended up having for welding?
**Speaker 2**: Yep.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: His.
**Speaker 2**: His.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: That was great.
**Speaker 2**: That was Jacob.
**Speaker 2**: Probably attest to the best.
**Jbower**: Welding canon's my A team, man.
**Jbower**: He's.
**Jbower**: He's.
**Jbower**: He's good.
**Ataylor**: Oh, yeah.
**Ataylor**: The guy who sent the recaps out.
**Speaker 2**: That was awesome.
**Jbower**: Yep.
**Speaker 2**: Okay, so right.
**Speaker 2**: Right here is where it's going to be.
**Speaker 2**: And then what about on this side?
**Speaker 2**: Is it going to be parts generally the same?
**Jbower**: Well, we're going to get them as close to those trailers as possible, Kelly.
**Speaker 2**: As close to the trailers as possible.
**Jbower**: Yes.
**Jbower**: That way your truck can still drive around them because we don't want.
**Speaker 2**: Okay, see, that's why I'm gonna do this.
**Jbower**: We don't want trucks driving underneath the boom.
**Jbower**: Right?
**Speaker 2**: Okay.
**Jbower**: Yeah, we want to around it.
**Speaker 2**: Okay.
**Speaker 2**: So if these trucks, though, if they need to come out in those five hours, because there's going to be trucks here, if they need to move, we're going to have to accommodate that.
**Jbower**: Okay.
**Speaker 2**: And I will put that in the email.
**Speaker 2**: So it's as close as possible and on both sides.
**Speaker 2**: If trucks in these areas, Jacob, if we need to move them, that's the coordination of.
**Speaker 2**: We just need to tell Candon.
**Speaker 2**: And then we're going to have to take down what I would suggest.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: Have.
**Ataylor**: Have Kanden partner with.
**Ataylor**: I'm.
**Ataylor**: I'll be candid with you.
**Ataylor**: I'm not about to be here at 5:30.
**Speaker 2**: Very valid.
**Speaker 2**: Very valid.
**Ataylor**: Later Monday.
**Jbower**: So.
**Jbower**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: But what I would do is have him partner with Marcos and then go talk to the schedulers on the inbound, outbound side.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: Just to see, hey, what dock doors do we not have live trailers in?
**Ataylor**: Some of those might be RTRs, and so there's no driver going to pick them up.
**Ataylor**: And those.
**Ataylor**: That would be a prime opportunity.
**Ataylor**: Park the boom in front of those.
**Ataylor**: There's no impact of needing to move them.
**Ataylor**: But just coordinate, hey, what.
**Ataylor**: What doors can we, you know, or trailers can we park in front of right now with minimal impact, and then they may be able to swing some live loads around too.
**Ataylor**: On that inbound side.
**Ataylor**: Hey, have the drivers go on the, you know, front part of the building versus the back.
**Jbower**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: And then the same thing with the outbound.
**Ataylor**: I know we got like our FedEx UPS trailers over there that, you know, have certain pickup times.
**Ataylor**: And I want to say there in the afternoon, evening, so there's no truck attached.
**Ataylor**: You probably park in front of those.
**Ataylor**: But I would just have him get with Marcus and the schedulers figure out, hey, what dock doors can we park this boom in front of with no impact and then just go from there.
**Jbower**: It does have to be in that general.
**Jbower**: So, Kelly, if you want to go back to your screenshot, it does have to be in that.
**Jbower**: So it's those.
**Jbower**: See, it's those two right there.
**Jbower**: Yep.
**Jbower**: One, two.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Jbower**: So it does have to be obviously, in that general area.
**Jbower**: So I'm seeing, like, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 trailers around there like that.
**Jbower**: That's going to be kind of where it's at, where your.
**Jbower**: Your red.
**Jbower**: Your red squares are generally.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, I think that that outbound side, that on the top of the picture, I don't think we'll have any issues.
**Ataylor**: I think those are just empty.
**Ataylor**: So over there will be fine.
**Jbower**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: But the inbound side, we're going to want to coordinate because those are live doors.
**Jbower**: Yep.
**Ataylor**: And I'm gonna have a ton of trucks coming up in Monday morning.
**Jbower**: Yeah, Yeah, I wish we could.
**Jbower**: It's just.
**Jbower**: It's hard to get these cranes, guys, and they're expensive.
**Jbower**: So when you get a date, you want to lock it in.
**Ataylor**: Oh, it's all good.
**Ataylor**: We'll be able to accommodate.
**Ataylor**: Okay, now that works.
**Ataylor**: That's what I would have Canon do.
**Ataylor**: That way everybody's aligned.
**Ataylor**: Marcos can be point of contact with the schedulers, and then we can move some stuff around or figure out, hey, these doors, go ahead.
**Ataylor**: Block them now.
**Jbower**: Okay.
**Jbower**: Kelly, will you copy Candon in on that email?
**Speaker 2**: Yep.
**Speaker 2**: What's his email?
**Speaker 2**: Is it the similar vein of yours of like, crusin at Alita Group?
**Speaker 2**: I already have it.
**Speaker 2**: It is.
**Speaker 2**: I got him.
**Speaker 2**: Okay, cool.
**Speaker 2**: Patrick, we will have tomorrow, Saturday, we'll have folks on site to evaluate and ensure.
**Speaker 2**: AJ Will get a list of names of you and add to the thread.
**Speaker 2**: Marcos adding you for the point of contact to assist with coordination with the schedules.
**Speaker 2**: It will be needed.
**Jbower**: Yeah.
**Jbower**: Hey, Charles is texting me now.
**Jbower**: And no impact operations Saturday.
**Jbower**: Okay, they will.
**Jbower**: And they're gonna.
**Jbower**: They're gonna keep it.
**Jbower**: They won't start.
**Jbower**: Start building the crane, if that makes sense.
**Jbower**: So you have to add arms to it and get it ready.
**Jbower**: So they're ready to rock and roll on Monday morning?
**Jbower**: Right away, but like I said, no impact operations.
**Jbower**: You'll still be able to drive around there.
**Speaker 2**: Okay, so the site, though, not the.
**Jbower**: Full crane, but they will start building it?
**Jbower**: Yes.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Where are they gonna do that?
**Ataylor**: Just so I can communicate.
**Jbower**: It'll be in that dumpster kind of area right there.
**Speaker 2**: Right here?
**Jbower**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: Is there a better location?
**Speaker 2**: Like, do we want to start on the outbound side?
**Speaker 2**: Since that's that more clear that.
**Ataylor**: Let me see.
**Ataylor**: Let me.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, let me Walk out there and see what we have going on.
**Ataylor**: Because the only pinch points are going to be around those turns on both sides.
**Ataylor**: So it may be easier to do it, like, along that curb on the inbound side, as long as there's still a drive path through there.
**Speaker 2**: Okay, Right.
**Speaker 2**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: But let me walk out there and see, and then I can.
**Ataylor**: I can let you all know what makes the most sense.
**Ataylor**: I'm leaning towards, you know, that curb right there on the bottom of the screen.
**Jbower**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: But a little bit further down that way.
**Ataylor**: It's not on the pinch point.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: Okay, that makes sense.
**Ataylor**: And that way, trucks can drive through, no issue.
**Ataylor**: And then we need to move it.
**Ataylor**: We'll just have to coordinate.
**Ataylor**: Make sure we pause the inbound outbound when you guys are moving that thing.
**Jbower**: Yeah, Cool.
**Speaker 2**: Good deal.
**Speaker 2**: And then, of course, you know, this is happening the day before I get there.
**Speaker 2**: Jacob.
**Speaker 2**: But I will be there Tuesday for you for the rest of the week.
**Speaker 2**: But.
**Speaker 2**: Okay.
**Speaker 2**: And then.
**Speaker 2**: Okay, so adding.
**Speaker 2**: I will be available if need anything.
**Speaker 2**: Canon will be on site.
**Speaker 2**: Canon.
**Speaker 2**: Marco, please coordinate morning Morning with the schedulers.
**Speaker 2**: Specifically.
**Speaker 2**: Specifically, the inbound side may need some moves.
**Speaker 2**: Okay, cool.
**Speaker 2**: And then good to go there, A.J.
**Speaker 2**: what I do need from you, though, is where are these ducks moving to?
**Speaker 2**: We still don't have a drawing showing that.
**Ataylor**: Kelly, can you send me that snip real quick while you have it up?
**Jbower**: Just.
**Ataylor**: I'm gonna go get with my team here right now just to walk them through what's going on.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: Kelly, also put the snip in the email.
**Ataylor**: Go.
**Jbower**: Go take a peek at that drawing, at that email I sent you.
**Speaker 2**: And.
**Jbower**: And there's a little drawing.
**Jbower**: You know, this duck's only going 20 foot.
**Jbower**: 15 to 20 foot, so.
**Jbower**: Oh, location of duct on roof.
**Jbower**: Yeah.
**Jbower**: Okay, so that bottom one, we're going to be going out.
**Jbower**: Out to the right.
**Jbower**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: Right.
**Jbower**: Yes.
**Speaker 2**: No, it can't go to the right.
**Speaker 2**: Let me pull up.
**Speaker 2**: Hold on.
**Ataylor**: Maybe you all need me on here for this.
**Speaker 2**: No, we don't need you.
**Speaker 2**: Sorry.
**Speaker 2**: Thank you, Jacob.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, I appreciate it, guys.
**Speaker 2**: Yep.
**Speaker 2**: Appreciate it.
**Speaker 2**: All right, let me.
**Speaker 2**: Let me pull up a drawing real quick.
**Speaker 2**: Hold on.
**Speaker 2**: Let me also respond.
**Speaker 2**: I thought I had it wrong open, but I don't think I do.
**Speaker 2**: Oh, yeah, I do.
**Speaker 2**: Hold on.
**Speaker 2**: Let me do dowel retro RTU modifications.
**Speaker 2**: Let me show.
**Speaker 2**: So that's why I wanted the drawing, because we can't.
**Speaker 2**: So if this is the warehouse.
**Jbower**: Yep.
**Speaker 2**: I would think this one here.
**Speaker 2**: And to your point, I actually don't know how this.
**Speaker 2**: Okay.
**Speaker 2**: Actually, I lied because like this.
**Speaker 2**: If we look at all of this.
**Speaker 2**: Let me.
**Speaker 2**: Sorry.
**Speaker 2**: That's where the conditions came in from.
**Speaker 2**: Hold on, let me copy that.
**Speaker 2**: Or actually, maybe I can group that.
**Speaker 2**: Can I group?
**Speaker 2**: I don't know.
**Speaker 2**: I don't think so.
**Speaker 2**: That's okay.
**Jbower**: Do you like using OneNote?
**Speaker 2**: No, I hate it.
**Speaker 2**: But it's better than nothing.
**Jbower**: Well, I've used it.
**Jbower**: I like it.
**Jbower**: So I don't know.
**Jbower**: It works well with my iPad.
**Speaker 2**: It does it.
**Jbower**: They're like in construction, we use Bluebeam a lot too.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: So that's what it's.
**Speaker 2**: Blue beam's really nice.
**Speaker 2**: That's.
**Speaker 2**: You read my mind.
**Speaker 2**: That's like what I miss using is Bluebeam.
**Speaker 2**: But Ulta is not.
**Speaker 2**: Which.
**Speaker 2**: There's only one of me.
**Speaker 2**: So I get it.
**Speaker 2**: I was hoping I could like rotate it.
**Speaker 2**: I don't guess I don't know really how to do that.
**Speaker 2**: Well in here.
**Speaker 2**: Oh, actually, yeah, I do.
**Speaker 2**: Hold on.
**Speaker 2**: I'm a silly goose.
**Speaker 2**: We'll just do this again.
**Speaker 2**: My favorite thing to do.
**Speaker 2**: Copy.
**Speaker 2**: Because I.
**Speaker 2**: That's where like my confusion is.
**Jbower**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: How do I.
**Speaker 2**: Can I not order?
**Speaker 2**: Rotate.
**Speaker 2**: There we go.
**Speaker 2**: Rotate.
**Speaker 2**: Rotate another 90.
**Speaker 2**: Okay.
**Speaker 2**: So I.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: This is how it is in Google Maps.
**Speaker 2**: Okay.
**Jbower**: Yep.
**Speaker 2**: So to your point.
**Speaker 2**: That's why I was confused.
**Speaker 2**: So this is kind of what I was getting at with that and why I wanted.
**Speaker 2**: The thing is, we do have another two rows going right here and right here.
**Speaker 2**: So I didn't know if we could do the ductwork two over.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Jbower**: What's that distance roughly?
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, I can find out for you.
**Speaker 2**: I got my cat up.
**Speaker 2**: Here's the.
**Speaker 2**: The distance would be.
**Jbower**: I didn't think about the two future.
**Jbower**: That's.
**Jbower**: And we just have to move them again.
**Jbower**: So we don't want to do that.
**Speaker 2**: Right.
**Speaker 2**: Exactly.
**Speaker 2**: That's why I was like, let's just move it over.
**Speaker 2**: It would be around 50ft, I would say.
**Jbower**: Okay.
**Jbower**: Okay.
**Speaker 2**: And then the other one, I think will be where was.
**Speaker 2**: Let's see where the other one.
**Jbower**: The other one will probably have to will 90 up.
**Jbower**: I.
**Jbower**: We were given like a general idea of what it came.
**Jbower**: I.
**Jbower**: I knew the bottom one we would have to go to the right.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: And then the.
**Speaker 2**: But I already had it.
**Speaker 2**: Oh, I did.
**Speaker 2**: And then the top one.
**Speaker 2**: I assumed we would just go this out and.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, just like that.
**Speaker 2**: Just out.
**Speaker 2**: Exactly.
**Speaker 2**: So that one can be like very close.
**Speaker 2**: Right.
**Speaker 2**: But this one to con.
**Speaker 2**: That's why I was asking.
**Speaker 2**: And I should have brought that up.
**Speaker 2**: Earlier.
**Speaker 2**: Like, don't forget we have those two expansions going on in a year.
**Jbower**: No, no.
**Jbower**: I'm glad that you brought it up.
**Jbower**: So I'll get with Charles, and honestly.
**Jbower**: Okay, so we were only planning, like, 20, 25 foot.
**Jbower**: Yeah.
**Jbower**: So I'm glad that you said don't alter the PO because there may be a little bit of added duct work.
**Jbower**: Not a ton.
**Speaker 2**: That's what I figured.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Jbower**: Okay, good.
**Jbower**: All right.
**Speaker 2**: See, that's what I knew.
**Speaker 2**: I figured if there were any change orders or, like, anything we needed, we're covered.
**Jbower**: On it.
**Speaker 2**: We're covered.
**Speaker 2**: And then we'll just invoice what we actually.
**Speaker 2**: Oh, and then we'll close it.
**Jbower**: Well, it's going to be nowhere near the 300 grand, but that.
**Jbower**: That helps that it's right.
**Speaker 2**: Well, we might double dip in that 300 grand with you.
**Speaker 2**: There's a couple HBLS next week.
**Speaker 2**: I'll let you know.
**Speaker 2**: There's a couple HPLs fans that we might sneak into this and, like.
**Jbower**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: Have you.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, that's fine, because we have the money for it because of the.
**Speaker 2**: So more to come.
**Speaker 2**: That's something I'm walking next week, but.
**Jbower**: Okay.
**Speaker 2**: Okay, cool.
**Jbower**: Let me know.
**Speaker 2**: We'll do.
**Speaker 2**: All right.
**Speaker 2**: Thank you so much for your time.
**Jbower**: So I'll have a list of names to you, and then a little more clarity on what the setup of the building of the crane is.
**Jbower**: Okay.
**Speaker 2**: Okay, awesome.
**Speaker 2**: Thank you.
**Jbower**: All right, See you.
**Speaker 2**: Yep.
**Speaker 2**: Bye.
