## Transcript
**Bryan.sheward**: How's it going, guys?
**Colin.nicoski**: Good.
**Colin.nicoski**: Colin.
**Chad.mayes**: Hey, alleatogroup.
**Chad.mayes**: We got Colin and Chad.
**Chad.mayes**: I don't know, was bryan able to join today or.
**Chad.mayes**: I'm just going to roll with it.
**Bryan.sheward**: He mentioned jumping on, but I don't know if he got caught up in something, but we can get going on and he pops in then in chad.
**Colin.nicoski**: Okay.
**Chad.mayes**: Well, it's good to meet you guys.
**Chad.mayes**: I don't think.
**Chad.mayes**: I'm sure you guys know we worked with you on a couple projects I think now, but the one currently is at Bloomington and that was similar with the Kokomo where they.
**Chad.mayes**: Well, not really similar.
**Chad.mayes**: You know, their loading dock just wasn't big enough.
**Chad.mayes**: So we ended up cutting back into the building so they could back up in there.
**Chad.mayes**: And then same thing with that one.
**Chad.mayes**: We added a donation canopy which you guys looks like you drew in here.
**Chad.mayes**: I don't know if I'm sharing my screen.
**Chad.mayes**: Is that.
**Chad.mayes**: Is like this a drawing you guys might have done?
**Bryan.sheward**: Yeah, that looks like the most recent ones.
**Chad.mayes**: Okay.
**Chad.mayes**: So I was out there on Thursday and took some pictures of the area.
**Chad.mayes**: And like this photo here is like, it's kind of almost where that donation canopy is shown on your drawing.
**Bryan.sheward**: Gotcha.
**Chad.mayes**: And so they had, in this building, they built their own like loading dock for trucks to back up to.
**Chad.mayes**: And obviously that does.
**Chad.mayes**: You know, our donation canopy is going to need to be at finished floor elevation, so because that's just a walk in, there's a vestibule and you know, they just drop stuff off and take it right into the store.
**Chad.mayes**: So looking at this, like all this area, this whole parking lot just drains into an open end.
**Chad.mayes**: There's a storm pipe in that.
**Chad.mayes**: Got another picture here.
**Chad.mayes**: Like there's this pipe with a screen over it.
**Colin.nicoski**: Interesting.
**Bryan.sheward**: We know where that drains back into then.
**Bryan.sheward**: Seems like it's going under the building.
**Chad.mayes**: Under the building?
**Colin.nicoski**: Yeah.
**Chad.mayes**: So it's like, who knows what's left to fill underneath that building.
**Bryan.sheward**: And are they planning on keeping these?
**Chad.mayes**: No, these get closed in.
**Colin.nicoski**: Yeah.
**Chad.mayes**: There.
**Chad.mayes**: So that's why I didn't know if that could be just extended on out into, you know, into the parking lot here, this drive, you know, and if we re slope, you know, I don't know how much the landlord's gonna be responsible for, but we would have to fill all this in and fix the grades.
**Colin.nicoski**: Yeah.
**Bryan.sheward**: That'S pretty questionable.
**Colin.nicoski**: Yeah.
**Chad.mayes**: So that's one of the issues.
**Chad.mayes**: And then you know what they're planning on doing.
**Chad.mayes**: You know, this is the space they want to take and then taken off the back of the building, put the trucks in there, and then that donation canopy would be somewhere in.
**Chad.mayes**: And somewhere in here.
**Colin.nicoski**: Okay.
**Chad.mayes**: But, you know, the problem is, you know, they want to put a separation, you know, have retail out here.
**Chad.mayes**: And this is the receiving for everything back here.
**Chad.mayes**: They're wanting to, you know, obviously this donation vestibule has to dump out into the back of house here.
**Chad.mayes**: And I don't know that that works because of the turn radius you're showing here.
**Chad.mayes**: Because if they put that all the way down here, that's.
**Chad.mayes**: It gets to be.
**Chad.mayes**: Because they also, you know, they don't like their stores.
**Chad.mayes**: You know, it.
**Chad.mayes**: The retail is this.
**Chad.mayes**: It's just a square box.
**Chad.mayes**: And then you'd have to have the donation canopy close enough so that they could, you know, have the doors and that entrance coming in from there.
**Bryan.sheward**: Can you.
**Bryan.sheward**: Would you mind sending these over to us too, so that we can kind of throw that canopy in the exact spot so we can run those.
**Bryan.sheward**: Those movements again.
**Bryan.sheward**: Probably give us a better understanding of how close it can sit so we can see exactly what we're working with.
**Colin.nicoski**: Okay.
**Chad.mayes**: See here.
**Chad.mayes**: All right.
**Chad.mayes**: And I can share.
**Chad.mayes**: I think I can share these photos too.
**Bryan.sheward**: And are they looking to do like full CDs for this kind of going moving forward or are we just trying to see if we can make it work still?
**Chad.mayes**: Yeah, we want to see what works and give them.
**Chad.mayes**: Give them that option.
**Chad.mayes**: Just, you know, because I don't know, like, obviously if they can't get the donation canopy in there, then that may be a problem with this building.
**Colin.nicoski**: Okay.
**Bryan.sheward**: Yeah, we can take a look at this, see what we can make work with that truck there.
**Bryan.sheward**: So if they can't get it to that location that you're showing right now, then it's out of the picture then.
**Chad.mayes**: Possibly.
**Colin.nicoski**: Yeah.
**Chad.mayes**: Yeah.
**Chad.mayes**: So back to this site plan here, because that would put.
**Chad.mayes**: I don't know what the scale is, but that would.
**Chad.mayes**: To try and connect those two.
**Chad.mayes**: Then you're putting this canopy here and, you know, I don't know how far that sticks out is like 25ft.
**Chad.mayes**: Looks like 22ft.
**Colin.nicoski**: Yeah.
**Bryan.sheward**: Think you have other options if that's not.
**Bryan.sheward**: Are they like, opposed to doing interior stuff of.
**Bryan.sheward**: I don't know how the interior GW work, but putting like a hallway, I guess, kind of on that side to connect those two together.
**Colin.nicoski**: Yeah, yeah.
**Bryan.sheward**: They're like a ten foot.
**Colin.nicoski**: Yeah.
**Bryan.sheward**: And obviously you probably know better than me of how these work interior, but if that's an option for them just to make this site work.
**Colin.nicoski**: Yeah.
**Chad.mayes**: I don't know, because, like, their donation vestibules, they.
**Chad.mayes**: They come in, they would drop box.
**Chad.mayes**: They have a, you know, for Bloomington, open that up.
**Chad.mayes**: This is kind of how their donation vestibules look.
**Chad.mayes**: So in this case, you know, this whole area back here is their receiving area.
**Colin.nicoski**: Okay.
**Chad.mayes**: So this would be a similar setup.
**Chad.mayes**: Then they have this conveyor machine that sits right here that they can just pass stuff through.
**Bryan.sheward**: That wouldn't really work.
**Bryan.sheward**: Then carry it a little bit farther.
**Chad.mayes**: Be a little difficult.
**Colin.nicoski**: Okay.
**Bryan.sheward**: Yeah.
**Bryan.sheward**: We can see how close we can get it done.
**Colin.nicoski**: Okay.
**Chad.mayes**: And then on the outside also, maybe it's not a big deal, but there's a power pole here at the corner here.
**Chad.mayes**: Illustrates a little better than the same thing.
**Chad.mayes**: There's a pole right here because we're talking about cutting off, like, this whole corner back to the first column line, I think is right around here somewhere in here to take this whole corner out.
**Chad.mayes**: I don't know how the power company is there about moving a line, but it looks like this comes off the street pole and then goes back to these poles.
**Colin.nicoski**: Okay.
**Bryan.sheward**: I don't have much.
**Bryan.sheward**: Chad, do you think that's.
**Chad.mayes**: But this poll would have to go.
**Njepson**: Do you have a photo looking up on it?
**Chad.mayes**: I didn't.
**Chad.mayes**: Those were the two photos I took of it.
**Chad.mayes**: Let me see.
**Njepson**: It's got, like, transformers and such on it.
**Chad.mayes**: This one, I don't think had any transformers on it.
**Chad.mayes**: I think it's just a. Yeah.
**Chad.mayes**: This one, I'm pretty sure was just.
**Chad.mayes**: Just transmitting the wires from this pole.
**Chad.mayes**: It went to this pole and then went out to the street.
**Colin.nicoski**: Oh, yeah.
**Bryan.sheward**: It's gonna.
**Njepson**: That's probably gonna be a challenge.
**Njepson**: I would anticipate the electric company probably having sole shoes.
**Njepson**: I wouldn't say issues, but they may, like, give you a crazy number to move it.
**Njepson**: That was a betting pun.
**Chad.mayes**: Okay.
**Chad.mayes**: Because I think right now, like, there's a pole here, and then those wires go from here to that pole and back to this setup back here, wherever that is.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: And it's three phase.
**Chad.mayes**: It looks like it.
**Colin.nicoski**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: Probably want to start coordinating with them sooner than later.
**Njepson**: It's doable.
**Njepson**: But, like, usually.
**Colin.nicoski**: Is that.
**Njepson**: Is that it the one down there, or is it the one to the left here?
**Chad.mayes**: Yeah, it's this one here we need to move.
**Njepson**: It's got three phase on it.
**Chad.mayes**: Yeah, looks like it.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: We probably want to definitely coordinate with them on that relocation.
**Colin.nicoski**: And then.
**Njepson**: You probably know better than me, Jesse, but I would expect a pretty.
**Njepson**: Usually the utility companies don't Want to deal with it, they'll give you some absurd fee.
**Njepson**: And it's right next to the building.
**Colin.nicoski**: Really?
**Bryan.sheward**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: So I'm just.
**Njepson**: Who is it AEP.
**Chad.mayes**: That.
**Chad.mayes**: I don't even.
**Chad.mayes**: I'm not even sure who the power company.
**Chad.mayes**: It's in Kokomo, but it's aep.
**Colin.nicoski**: Okay.
**Chad.mayes**: And then if this is the plan we're using.
**Colin.nicoski**: Like when, you know, we.
**Chad.mayes**: Dip this down to create the loading dock.
**Chad.mayes**: This drainage here.
**Chad.mayes**: Is that.
**Chad.mayes**: Do you have any.
**Chad.mayes**: Would you have an idea of where that would drain to?
**Bryan.sheward**: You just put it back under the building.
**Bryan.sheward**: No, I'm joking.
**Bryan.sheward**: Yeah, we'd have to look at.
**Colin.nicoski**: Like.
**Bryan.sheward**: The surrounding inverts of everything to see what we can connect into.
**Chad.mayes**: Felt like they were.
**Njepson**: They were making it seem like they wanted it to be able to back into the building, But I didn't know if heights and whatnot would work.
**Njepson**: That was the direction they gave us when we were doing that site plan.
**Njepson**: That's why the truck's in the building.
**Chad.mayes**: Yeah, they'll have to.
**Chad.mayes**: Because this truck just stays parked there, and they just swap it out.
**Chad.mayes**: You know, they'll park a full semi trailer in there, and then I don't know if it's once a day.
**Chad.mayes**: It just depends how active the facility is, though, you know, that's what their plan would be to.
**Chad.mayes**: They would bring a new empty truck, park it here, hook onto this one, pull it out, drop it here, go back, catch this one, and then back it up into here, and then it would just stay there.
**Njepson**: So it would be inside of the building with like a garage down on it.
**Njepson**: Garage door or something.
**Chad.mayes**: Well, our plan was like.
**Chad.mayes**: Yeah, this.
**Chad.mayes**: Well, it would just look like a loading dock.
**Chad.mayes**: And we would make.
**Chad.mayes**: We would basically just remove this whole corner of the building.
**Chad.mayes**: Because there's a column here, and then there's a beam running across here to the next column.
**Chad.mayes**: And then the bar joists run this way.
**Chad.mayes**: So there's a bar joist, like, right here.
**Chad.mayes**: We would just cut all this out, leave this masonry wall here to support this bar joist.
**Chad.mayes**: They're currently.
**Chad.mayes**: They're all bearing on this outside wall, the bar joist running this way.
**Chad.mayes**: And then this would all be just gone.
**Chad.mayes**: And we put up new masonry walls here and here.
**Chad.mayes**: And they create this loading dock.
**Chad.mayes**: And then this.
**Chad.mayes**: We would have to grade this down.
**Chad.mayes**: I don't know, it's three foot or whatever.
**Chad.mayes**: So the truck end is close, and we have a dock leveler we put in as well.
**Njepson**: Gotcha.
**Njepson**: So you'd have to have a Drain down there and then storm under the building, right, Kokomo?
**Chad.mayes**: That's right.
**Chad.mayes**: Everything here goes under the building.
**Chad.mayes**: And you know, I don't know the depth of this.
**Chad.mayes**: Like the drain that's there and it's going under the building.
**Chad.mayes**: God knows where it goes to.
**Colin.nicoski**: But.
**Chad.mayes**: You know, one thing I wonder, think about it.
**Chad.mayes**: I wonder if.
**Chad.mayes**: What if we tell them instead of that.
**Chad.mayes**: Why not?
**Chad.mayes**: Is there any.
**Chad.mayes**: Any reason you couldn't.
**Chad.mayes**: It might make their loading easier to.
**Chad.mayes**: If we build something out here.
**Chad.mayes**: We built a loading dock coming out from the building like that and then their trucks could.
**Chad.mayes**: They could just back the truck up like this to it.
**Chad.mayes**: You know, it's already super low over here, so we would just drop it down.
**Chad.mayes**: We got that drain over there and just kind of re.
**Chad.mayes**: Slope this area.
**Chad.mayes**: Put a wall up.
**Chad.mayes**: Put a wall in here, drop that down to the loading dock.
**Njepson**: The issue was having that drop.
**Njepson**: We looked at this was having a drop off canopy there on that side of the building too.
**Chad.mayes**: Well, that's what I'm thinking.
**Chad.mayes**: Like this sticks out here.
**Chad.mayes**: And then I don't know if they're.
**Chad.mayes**: Do they have setbacks or anything where you can't build out any closer to the street there.
**Chad.mayes**: Do you know.
**Njepson**: We didn't get like a true survey.
**Njepson**: This was all GIs.
**Njepson**: But yeah, I'm sure that that building's probably pretty close to the setback.
**Njepson**: What do you think, Colin?
**Colin.nicoski**: Yeah.
**Colin.nicoski**: Is it.
**Chad.mayes**: So we could.
**Chad.mayes**: We couldn't add anything out here.
**Bryan.sheward**: That's kind of what they're like new.
**Bryan.sheward**: Typical with new buildings is what it seems like just what you were showing there is kind of what they've begun doing.
**Chad.mayes**: Because then you could put the donation canopy.
**Chad.mayes**: That's.
**Chad.mayes**: I was thinking it could go behind this thing.
**Chad.mayes**: Well, if they're going to be able to build the donation canopy out, then they would be able to come out this way.
**Colin.nicoski**: Right.
**Chad.mayes**: If they were to put the donation canopy here.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: We would just need to look into the setbacks to see if a variance would be needed or anything.
**Colin.nicoski**: Okay.
**Njepson**: But what I'm saying is I think Goodwill was hell bent on having the canopy on that side.
**Njepson**: I couldn't get the.
**Njepson**: We couldn't get the truck turned to work with that there in the dock.
**Chad.mayes**: Oh, because they have to.
**Chad.mayes**: They couldn't come in off the street then.
**Colin.nicoski**: If.
**Chad.mayes**: If they don't have to come around this corner, could they come in off the street?
**Chad.mayes**: Oh, because they had to come past that.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: And then not only that, the little canopy bump out to the west there too.
**Njepson**: Kind of got in the way with the way the truck was maneuvering the existing one off the building.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: We looked at it all sorts of ways.
**Njepson**: And like, this was the only way to get it to work.
**Njepson**: Having this dock there like that and chomp it off the building.
**Chad.mayes**: Well, if we did chop off the building and put the donation canopy back here, because then you only need to have like, a car be able to, like, drive through here.
**Chad.mayes**: I don't know if that works.
**Bryan.sheward**: I think they prefer the straight through, I guess, that you kind of, like angled it.
**Colin.nicoski**: Yeah.
**Chad.mayes**: Like through here.
**Colin.nicoski**: Yeah.
**Bryan.sheward**: Basically.
**Bryan.sheward**: Kind of like how you have that rectangle drawn through the one that we drew.
**Bryan.sheward**: Basically that truck basically to drive east, west, straight through.
**Colin.nicoski**: Yeah.
**Bryan.sheward**: Probably fit more cars kind of side by side, too.
**Colin.nicoski**: Okay.
**Chad.mayes**: I guess look at it then to see how.
**Chad.mayes**: With the turning radius, how we could.
**Chad.mayes**: How much further.
**Chad.mayes**: You could put this thing this way.
**Colin.nicoski**: Yeah.
**Chad.mayes**: And then we just continue on with putting that semi Backing it up into here.
**Chad.mayes**: And do they need.
**Chad.mayes**: Yeah, so they just need a cut back here just for the turning of the truck.
**Chad.mayes**: Because on this side of the building, Then we would have.
**Colin.nicoski**: Whatever wall we.
**Chad.mayes**: Would need for that down ramp.
**Chad.mayes**: But.
**Chad.mayes**: Okay, so that's the easy one.
**Chad.mayes**: So now we'll look at the Allisonville.
**Chad.mayes**: Or is there anything else you want to look at on that With.
**Bryan.sheward**: With that, like basically rebuilding the wall there for that power pole.
**Bryan.sheward**: Is that still needing to move then?
**Chad.mayes**: That's a good point.
**Chad.mayes**: Yeah.
**Chad.mayes**: If we could put in.
**Chad.mayes**: Yeah, we just.
**Chad.mayes**: Just come up off of this.
**Chad.mayes**: I don't know where this foundation is underneath that.
**Chad.mayes**: But at least if we could.
**Chad.mayes**: I don't know where we start dropping down.
**Chad.mayes**: You know, if the footing's two foot to the top of it.
**Chad.mayes**: I don't know how much further they went down.
**Chad.mayes**: We could somehow work that drive in to keep that and then just put up.
**Colin.nicoski**: Sure.
**Chad.mayes**: We're gonna need a little bit of a retaining wall.
**Colin.nicoski**: Yeah.
**Bryan.sheward**: But obviously remove that issue.
**Bryan.sheward**: But something to look at.
**Chad.mayes**: And is that.
**Chad.mayes**: Will that pole be in this.
**Chad.mayes**: Any of this turning?
**Chad.mayes**: Because it's about right here to your point.
**Bryan.sheward**: Yeah, I'll try to.
**Bryan.sheward**: I'll see what I can do.
**Bryan.sheward**: Avoiding it.
**Colin.nicoski**: Okay.
**Chad.mayes**: See that thing is one.
**Chad.mayes**: Try to count these block.
**Chad.mayes**: Since I didn't use my tape measure.
**Chad.mayes**: There's about 12 block back, which would be about.
**Chad.mayes**: These are 16 inch block.
**Chad.mayes**: Like 15 foot.
**Chad.mayes**: 16 foot back.
**Colin.nicoski**: There you go.
**Bryan.sheward**: Yeah, I'll throw that in there and see.
**Chad.mayes**: Because they got the guy wire here too.
**Chad.mayes**: That'd be a problem.
**Colin.nicoski**: Okay.
**Bryan.sheward**: Basically the big thing you need is just another turn exhibit from us to see what we can do, how close we can get it.
**Colin.nicoski**: Yeah, yeah.
**Chad.mayes**: Moving this as far back as possible.
**Bryan.sheward**: And I don't know if that's a pretty customary.
**Bryan.sheward**: Like the 25ft is what they like to.
**Bryan.sheward**: I don't know if we get close enough if they would be willing to trim it down a little bit.
**Bryan.sheward**: I'm sure it's pretty standard for them.
**Colin.nicoski**: But.
**Bryan.sheward**: Just options if it gets to that point.
**Chad.mayes**: And I don't know what we could do to cantilever the.
**Chad.mayes**: Can the drop off, maybe get rid of those columns.
**Chad.mayes**: And if it's tall enough for semi to go under.
**Chad.mayes**: I don't know if those are options.
**Bryan.sheward**: See what we can do without all the extras first and then get to that point.
**Colin.nicoski**: Okay.
**Chad.mayes**: All right, then.
**Chad.mayes**: This is Allisonville.
**Chad.mayes**: This is definitely your drawing.
**Chad.mayes**: So looking at it, you open up these photos here.
**Chad.mayes**: So this is the front of that store with the big lots, like right here.
**Chad.mayes**: Like between this column.
**Chad.mayes**: You know, between this column and this column is where they want to try and create.
**Chad.mayes**: See, create somewhere where they can extend this out.
**Chad.mayes**: Like we would take this column and this column out.
**Colin.nicoski**: Yeah.
**Bryan.sheward**: I think the way I had drawn it was obviously the space is pretty tight with the dry vials.
**Bryan.sheward**: So I had drawn it basically that 25ft starts at the face of the building.
**Bryan.sheward**: So the white.
**Bryan.sheward**: So it kind of have to take a couple.
**Bryan.sheward**: Yeah, they had 26ft take all this out.
**Colin.nicoski**: Yeah.
**Bryan.sheward**: So basically I think you'd have to take a couple.
**Bryan.sheward**: There'd be more rework with the building where that black, like fascia kind of was coming down because.
**Colin.nicoski**: Yeah.
**Bryan.sheward**: So I think the idea was kind of to get the cars, like almost underneath that area.
**Bryan.sheward**: That makes sense.
**Colin.nicoski**: Yeah.
**Chad.mayes**: Yeah, that's what we were thinking.
**Chad.mayes**: Like if we take.
**Colin.nicoski**: Yeah.
**Chad.mayes**: Should have marked this thing up.
**Chad.mayes**: Let's see here.
**Bryan.sheward**: Or we can push it out and go off the.
**Bryan.sheward**: That curb line, essentially, and obviously remove probably another parking.
**Bryan.sheward**: Parking stall aisle.
**Colin.nicoski**: Okay.
**Chad.mayes**: Because what we were thinking this was our.
**Chad.mayes**: Would be to take this column and this column out and basically bring a new beam in across to a new column out here.
**Chad.mayes**: So we're coming out, like.
**Colin.nicoski**: We move.
**Chad.mayes**: These columns out like eight or ten foot or so, come back through to support this roof, which shouldn't be much.
**Chad.mayes**: It looks.
**Chad.mayes**: This must be just like a framed detail on the front so that then cars could come in, pull in through here, and then out.
**Colin.nicoski**: Yeah.
**Chad.mayes**: I don't know.
**Chad.mayes**: I mean, that'll save a little.
**Chad.mayes**: You know, it just saves a Bunch of their parking lot.
**Colin.nicoski**: Yeah.
**Chad.mayes**: Is this kind of.
**Chad.mayes**: You drew it like.
**Chad.mayes**: This is the black line is the face of the building.
**Bryan.sheward**: That's.
**Bryan.sheward**: Yeah, that's like the outline.
**Bryan.sheward**: That's like the roof line.
**Bryan.sheward**: So basically where that.
**Colin.nicoski**: Yeah.
**Bryan.sheward**: So you can kind of see, like, where it's dark is where that angled roof is.
**Colin.nicoski**: Yeah.
**Chad.mayes**: Oh, so you did.
**Chad.mayes**: You did have it coming back in.
**Colin.nicoski**: Yeah.
**Colin.nicoski**: Okay.
**Chad.mayes**: And so that.
**Colin.nicoski**: That.
**Chad.mayes**: So, yeah, we're doing.
**Chad.mayes**: Thinking the same way.
**Chad.mayes**: You take these columns out, build a structure to support all that.
**Colin.nicoski**: And then.
**Chad.mayes**: Same photo.
**Chad.mayes**: Obviously, this thing goes away.
**Colin.nicoski**: Yeah.
**Colin.nicoski**: And then.
**Chad.mayes**: Then would we be just reworking the pain, basically?
**Chad.mayes**: This.
**Chad.mayes**: All of this pavement.
**Chad.mayes**: We'd rework it.
**Bryan.sheward**: Yeah, obviously.
**Bryan.sheward**: Yeah.
**Bryan.sheward**: We'd have to see the extents, obviously.
**Bryan.sheward**: I don't know how far we have to go based on the existing grading, but yeah, the idea would be just.
**Colin.nicoski**: To.
**Bryan.sheward**: Rework all that.
**Chad.mayes**: Did they have.
**Chad.mayes**: I don't know if the landlord.
**Chad.mayes**: Are they going to allow them to give up this many spaces?
**Bryan.sheward**: We haven't.
**Bryan.sheward**: I guess we haven't dove in that deep to this yet.
**Bryan.sheward**: They're kind of just looking for ideas.
**Bryan.sheward**: But that can start to be a discussion.
**Bryan.sheward**: We have to.
**Bryan.sheward**: I obviously talk to the city a little bit based on all the zoning requirements and do a little parking count just to see.
**Bryan.sheward**: And then talk about it with the landlord as well.
**Bryan.sheward**: So.
**Bryan.sheward**: Okay, that's something we can start digging into if you guys would like.
**Colin.nicoski**: Okay.
**Chad.mayes**: Yeah.
**Chad.mayes**: Then look at what you drew.
**Chad.mayes**: Yeah, we could.
**Chad.mayes**: We could build that.
**Chad.mayes**: They tried to buy this property, I guess a hundred times.
**Chad.mayes**: They won't sell.
**Chad.mayes**: It's craziest thing.
**Chad.mayes**: There's like six foot in between their fence and the building.
**Bryan.sheward**: I know they had talked about doing some, like.
**Bryan.sheward**: They basically wanted to see how a truck would work, obviously, for that reason probably, but they wanted to truck turn back there to see if they could do kind of the same.
**Bryan.sheward**: Same concept of getting a semi back there.
**Chad.mayes**: But they said.
**Colin.nicoski**: They kind of.
**Chad.mayes**: They.
**Chad.mayes**: They said that that's their plan.
**Chad.mayes**: Like, their loading dock will be, you know, this existing.
**Chad.mayes**: What they want us to do is to have you guys just drawing up basically a curb and a pad.
**Bryan.sheward**: Interesting.
**Chad.mayes**: With the concrete ramp going to a new.
**Chad.mayes**: A new lift gate like this.
**Colin.nicoski**: Okay.
**Bryan.sheward**: So it is all flat back there.
**Bryan.sheward**: There's no, like, truck dock.
**Chad.mayes**: Yeah, it's flat.
**Colin.nicoski**: Okay.
**Colin.nicoski**: Yeah.
**Chad.mayes**: So they planned on using this.
**Chad.mayes**: Getting stuff in and out of the truck.
**Colin.nicoski**: Yeah.
**Chad.mayes**: And the only reason they don't want the donation canopy back here is.
**Colin.nicoski**: They.
**Chad.mayes**: Just don't think they'd get as many donations.
**Chad.mayes**: People can't visibly see it.
**Chad.mayes**: Right there in the front.
**Bryan.sheward**: Yeah, it's kind of hidden back there around there too.
**Bryan.sheward**: Okay, so I guess are you good with just this kind of hand sketch or you guys wanting something a little bit more?
**Chad.mayes**: No, I think that'll.
**Chad.mayes**: Think that'll work and we'll just plan on like when it comes to the repavement, would you think.
**Colin.nicoski**: I don't know.
**Chad.mayes**: Is it basically everything?
**Chad.mayes**: Like, would we be able to tie this in?
**Bryan.sheward**: Yeah, I think the idea we were kind of talking about, those are going to be like curve islands potentially to kind of protect some of the parking.
**Colin.nicoski**: That kind of.
**Bryan.sheward**: So obviously if you were to do that, we'd probably have to pave farther out than that red line that you just showed.
**Colin.nicoski**: And is.
**Chad.mayes**: Do you have to.
**Chad.mayes**: Or could that just be a parking spot and a striping to delineate the drive lane?
**Bryan.sheward**: I think when I had initially talked about the.
**Bryan.sheward**: Talked to bryan awehner about this was it was more to kind of.
**Bryan.sheward**: Obviously it's kind of a weird traffic movement or different traffic movement.
**Bryan.sheward**: Those were just to like guide with the curb there.
**Bryan.sheward**: But I think, I mean, I'm sure we can get away with.
**Bryan.sheward**: With not.
**Bryan.sheward**: But it's more just a safety.
**Bryan.sheward**: Safety concern.
**Bryan.sheward**: And obviously I don't know what the city will want it want there either.
**Bryan.sheward**: Or the landlord.
**Colin.nicoski**: Yeah, yeah.
**Chad.mayes**: Because technically.
**Chad.mayes**: Well, I guess.
**Chad.mayes**: Do they have to be able to drive around front of the building?
**Colin.nicoski**: Yeah, yeah.
**Bryan.sheward**: So I need that 23, 24ft around the front of the building too.
**Bryan.sheward**: Just that standard drive.
**Chad.mayes**: Then that would free up 13 parking spaces too.
**Chad.mayes**: Looks like this.
**Chad.mayes**: 13 total.
**Bryan.sheward**: That's what you're saying.
**Chad.mayes**: Oh, the islands take up an additional 13 spots.
**Bryan.sheward**: I see what you're saying.
**Chad.mayes**: Versus if we just stripe around them.
**Bryan.sheward**: Yeah, definitely something to look into.
**Chad.mayes**: All right.
**Colin.nicoski**: Well.
**Chad.mayes**: All right, well, that's good.
**Chad.mayes**: I. I just got to try and get him a budget now to understand we can do like islands is like a alternate versus just fixing the paving.
**Colin.nicoski**: Okay.
**Chad.mayes**: There.
**Chad.mayes**: The new entry and.
**Colin.nicoski**: Okay.
**Bryan.sheward**: And are you wanting us to kind of move forward with kind of the parking in showing this to the city?
**Chad.mayes**: Yeah, I would hold off on that.
**Chad.mayes**: Let me get him the number and just see if that, you know, what they think of.
**Chad.mayes**: Of that and then we can follow up and then I don't know how soon.
**Chad.mayes**: I told him I'd get him a price this week for the Kokomo one.
**Chad.mayes**: Do you have a idea of how long it'll take to take a look at this?
**Bryan.sheward**: Yeah, I can.
**Bryan.sheward**: I can try to get it over to you by the end of the week.
**Bryan.sheward**: Might be early next week.
**Colin.nicoski**: Okay.
**Bryan.sheward**: But I'll try to get it.
**Bryan.sheward**: Get it done by Friday.
**Colin.nicoski**: Okay.
**Chad.mayes**: And then what we do to the front just for signage and stuff, that doesn't really affect you, does it?
**Colin.nicoski**: No.
**Colin.nicoski**: Okay.
**Chad.mayes**: Think we're rebuilding these mansards to.
**Colin.nicoski**: Look.
**Chad.mayes**: More like a entry to their store.
**Chad.mayes**: You'll see that in the interesting little brochure here.
**Chad.mayes**: I'm going to build this out, make this flat.
**Colin.nicoski**: Interesting.
**Colin.nicoski**: Okay.
**Bryan.sheward**: Yeah, I think that all.
**Bryan.sheward**: All makes sense.
**Chad.mayes**: Okay, Well, I appreciate you guys time.
**Chad.mayes**: I'll.
**Chad.mayes**: I'll look forward to getting that drawing from you, see how this thing progresses.
**Bryan.sheward**: Sounds good.
**Colin.nicoski**: All right.
**Chad.mayes**: Appreciate it.
**Njepson**: Thanks.
**Colin.nicoski**: Yes, thanks.
**Colin.nicoski**: Bye.
