## Transcript
**Lawrence.mitchell**: Notetaker bot for Alex.
**Matthew.perry**: All right, well I am going to record this meeting so everybody knows.
**Matthew.perry**: In case you have a problem with it, let me know and then we can go through the start going through the schedule if you like.
**Paul.wooldridge**: Gary.
**Paul.wooldridge**: Yeah, yeah.
**Paul.wooldridge**: All right.
**Matthew.perry**: Okay everybody, let me share my screen.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: And just to preface this that Lawrence is about to go through, this is the plan that Jake put together with all the senior stakeholders, the two phased plan.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: And what we'd like to do is get updates on the deliverables from these items and then Lawrence or I or both of us are going to go through and just incorporate it into the overall plan.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: So we're not working off these multiple plans.
**Matthew.perry**: Yeah, agree.
**Matthew.perry**: Can you guys see my screen now?
**Paul.wooldridge**: Yep.
**Matthew.perry**: Okay, let's just start from top, get a percentage complete CM server setup completed.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: I think that's complete Alex.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: You guys have downloaded all your software, right?
**Lawrence.mitchell**: And I think Exotech has too now.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: So I think the server set up is complete.
**Greg.mcintosh**: Unless somebody knows Ottawask from the intra 1 side.
**Greg.mcintosh**: Yeah, the servers have been set up.
**Greg.mcintosh**: I don't know about all the network and all the ports if that has been set up on the core Martin network yet, but we got to keep our eye on that, make sure they have everything set up for us.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: So yeah, I, I'd say 99 on that 1.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: We, we had a call with those guys and went through all the ports and IPS and the different VLANs and everything and I pretty sure it's set up unless there's still some open action items but.
**Matthew.perry**: We can follow it up on it.
**Paul.wooldridge**: Yeah.
**Paul.wooldridge**: All right.
**Matthew.perry**: What about the remote VPN connection?
**Lawrence.mitchell**: I think ditto on that one.
**Greg.mcintosh**: I think we're good.
**Kim.messer**: Yeah, Gary, I need to check into that one.
**Kim.messer**: I think David Grunshell has access maybe, but I need to follow up.
**Paul.wooldridge**: Okay.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: Yeah, I know.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: The one thing that I wasn't sure of is MTTQ.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: I think Exotech has theirs and I think Intro1 has theirs, but I wasn't sure about MTTQ if that's been downloaded.
**Kim.messer**: Yeah, I think it has to be because they're.
**Kim.messer**: Alex is here tested now.
**Kim.messer**: So if that wasn't stood up then we wouldn't get the data.
**Paul.wooldridge**: Okay.
**Matthew.perry**: We now have power to all the panels, correct?
**Matthew.perry**: ABC and CC1.
**Kim.messer**: For CC1.
**Kim.messer**: Yes, all panels are powered up.
**Matthew.perry**: Okay, good deal.
**Matthew.perry**: Seem to provide power to panel D. Do we know if that's done yet?
**Kim.messer**: I. I think it's powered.
**Kim.messer**: It was powered on I think.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: Yeah, that's the palletizer Right.
**Kim.messer**: It's supplying to conveyor to the palletizer.
**Kim.messer**: Yeah.
**Kim.messer**: But I'm pretty sure it was powered on yesterday.
**Matthew.perry**: All right.
**Mark.huntsman**: Yeah, it's powered on.
**Mark.huntsman**: We've tracked the decline belt and.
**Ahuettl**: Got power to it.
**Matthew.perry**: Good deal.
**Matthew.perry**: Exotic bin induction.
**Matthew.perry**: I have a. I have a company set up and I'm waiting on AJ to confirm that August 11th is the, is the, is the right date to come in and start loading the bins.
**Ahuettl**: We should be good that week.
**Ahuettl**: What I would say is that if we can have them not start first thing in the morning on a Monday because we'll have people traveling in to do the training with them.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah, we can either do a.
**Ahuettl**: Like a half day, second half Monday or Tuesday first thing start.
**Ahuettl**: That would be ideal so that we don't have to try and make someone travel in on a Sunday just to do.
**Matthew.perry**: Yeah, I was thinking, I was thinking, I was thinking Tuesday morning myself so I could come in on Monday.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: That was.
**Ahuettl**: That would be perfect.
**Ahuettl**: Because realistically somebody from my team will need to be here for a day or two tops to do training and help them with any issues that they see and then be pretty self sufficient and just need somebody to make sure.
**Kim.messer**: That they're monitoring their hours after that.
**Ahuettl**: To do everything else remotely.
**Matthew.perry**: Yeah, I've asked Mark to do it and then he's gonna pass it along to Israel and then in conjunction with me.
**Paul.wooldridge**: Okay.
**Matthew.perry**: All right, good deal.
**Matthew.perry**: So that started.
**Matthew.perry**: It's just not in the works yet.
**Matthew.perry**: Field wiring substantially completed for A, B and C. Mark, do you know.
**Paul.wooldridge**: I.
**Mark.huntsman**: Believe they are complete with A, B and C and are doing some work on.
**Mark.huntsman**: What is that D over by the XXI right now.
**Mark.huntsman**: Decant area.
**Mark.huntsman**: I think they're wiring, but those modules are done.
**Mark.huntsman**: If not 99.5% done.
**Mark.huntsman**: There might be some touch up stuff here and there, but.
**Matthew.perry**: Okay, so I'll just put 99 for now.
**Matthew.perry**: Field wire and complete panel D. That's the very last one.
**Matthew.perry**: Right.
**Matthew.perry**: So I think that's when you say he's working on now.
**Kim.messer**: Correct.
**Matthew.perry**: Okay.
**Matthew.perry**: What do you think he's at about 50%.
**Mark.huntsman**: I wouldn't have to ask him.
**Paul.wooldridge**: I don't want to.
**Mark.huntsman**: You can book 50%, but I don't know.
**Matthew.perry**: Yeah, that's fine.
**Matthew.perry**: We can update it later.
**Paul.wooldridge**: Yeah, yeah.
**Matthew.perry**: All right.
**Matthew.perry**: Controls debug.
**Matthew.perry**: Where are we standing with that, guys?
**Kim.messer**: Well, panel B, A.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: For everything.
**Matthew.perry**: Just.
**Matthew.perry**: Just in general.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: And Lawrence, I slid that description of work notes over there in that right column there if you want to add any notes in there.
**Paul.wooldridge**: Okay.
**Kim.messer**: I'M going to say about 65% complete.
**Kim.messer**: As I know today I just started on site to do a project handover, so I'm just getting up to speed on where everything's at.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: Okay, and, and you're.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: You're aware, David, of the priorities, right, that, that we had asked for those first three panels to be done first and I think those are largely complete.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: I think it's the last ones that are probably not done.
**Paul.wooldridge**: Right.
**Kim.messer**: The IDs I think the least on the priority as of right now.
**Paul.wooldridge**: Yep.
**Paul.wooldridge**: Okay.
**Matthew.perry**: It's your one installation and config.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: Alex, I think that one's probably you.
**Greg.mcintosh**: Yeah, we've been testing this week.
**Greg.mcintosh**: We got rate, case merge done, sequence are done.
**Greg.mcintosh**: Apparently I'm testing, diverting into the red stamp machines and then we just have the 7 to 1 merge as well.
**Greg.mcintosh**: So I would say config is done, installation's done.
**Greg.mcintosh**: It's just sit testing at this point.
**Matthew.perry**: Excellent.
**Matthew.perry**: And where do you think we sit at sit?
**Matthew.perry**: We still on track?
**Matthew.perry**: We still on track for 8?
**Matthew.perry**: 8 be complete?
**Greg.mcintosh**: I would say so, yeah.
**Greg.mcintosh**: I think we intro one's probably going to be done today or tomorrow for phase one.
**Greg.mcintosh**: Latest Thursday, I'd say.
**Paul.wooldridge**: Yeah.
**Greg.mcintosh**: And then I think it's just controls, you know, getting those other panels and the pick mods done, wired up, powered on, and I think we're golden.
**Matthew.perry**: So what about.
**Matthew.perry**: So we're strictly talking phase one, is that right?
**Paul.wooldridge**: Yeah.
**Matthew.perry**: Okay.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: I'd say 75% probably on that.
**Matthew.perry**: And we don't zero on the UAT because we haven't done anything yet.
**Paul.wooldridge**: Right.
**Matthew.perry**: So testing, go live bridge.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: Yeah, I think all the rest of it is zero.
**Paul.wooldridge**: Right?
**Lawrence.mitchell**: Zero.
**Greg.mcintosh**: Yeah.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: It's all not started.
**Matthew.perry**: All right, one question I have.
**Matthew.perry**: Do we on phase one, are we responsible for doing any load testing or anything like that?
**Paul.wooldridge**: You.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: You mean like conveyor stress?
**Matthew.perry**: Conveyor conveyor stress test or anything like that?
**Matthew.perry**: Right.
**Matthew.perry**: I know it's not really a rate because you're not using the smart machines.
**Paul.wooldridge**: But.
**Matthew.perry**: I just want to know, are we running the conveyors?
**Matthew.perry**: Because that's something I want to, I want to do ahead of time so we can see if there's anything's going to break or, or, you know, catastrophic is going to happen before we get to the uat.
**Greg.mcintosh**: Yeah, I think that's all more on the commissioning team, Warren.
**Greg.mcintosh**: So I think that would be A.J.
**Greg.mcintosh**: robert and his team to make sure, you know, totes are flown through all them pick mods correctly.
**Greg.mcintosh**: But as far as the merges, everything's looking Pretty good right now, so.
**Paul.wooldridge**: All right, excellent.
**Clayton.sprunck**: Yeah, so we.
**Ahuettl**: We have.
**Ahuettl**: Robert is on site this week doing his initial round of commissioning.
**Ahuettl**: We're still waiting, obviously on some of the field wiring to come differently.
**Paul.wooldridge**: Running.
**Ahuettl**: And then we'll.
**Ahuettl**: We will be.
**Ahuettl**: We will be looking to run as much volume as possible.
**Ahuettl**: Plan breaking thing, if you can see more, the battery.
**Matthew.perry**: Okay, good deal.
**Matthew.perry**: Gary, you want to go.
**Matthew.perry**: You want us to go into phase two next?
**Matthew.perry**: Are we not there yet?
**Shaun.hilbert**: Hey, real quick.
**Shaun.hilbert**: Sorry I'm late, guys.
**Paul.wooldridge**: Just.
**Shaun.hilbert**: 30 second recap with regards to phase one.
**Shaun.hilbert**: Have we transitioned from comms testing to sit, or are we doing them concurrently or where do we stand?
**Lawrence.mitchell**: Yeah, Ronnie, we just covered that the sit testing is about 75 complete.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: Should be done next week.
**Greg.mcintosh**: Yeah, there's a couple comms or scanners we're still testing, you know, making sure we're getting the data back from controls, but I think it's down to one one scanner at this point.
**Greg.mcintosh**: We have comms testing with.
**Greg.mcintosh**: But yeah, besides that and all the other comms have been taken care of for Phase one at least.
**Shaun.hilbert**: And, and all the right people.
**Shaun.hilbert**: Mohammed Khan, those guys on the core mark side, they're aligned to our testing status and they're.
**Shaun.hilbert**: They're participating actively and testing.
**Shaun.hilbert**: I would assume this is integration testing, right?
**Greg.mcintosh**: It's normally.
**Greg.mcintosh**: Yeah, internal.
**Greg.mcintosh**: They are sending us data.
**Paul.wooldridge**: Okay.
**Paul.wooldridge**: Okay.
**Greg.mcintosh**: That is, you know, it's kind of part of uat.
**Greg.mcintosh**: Kind of.
**Greg.mcintosh**: But I would say it's not necessarily UAT yet.
**Paul.wooldridge**: Okay.
**Shaun.hilbert**: Yeah.
**Paul.wooldridge**: So just.
**Shaun.hilbert**: Just putting this out there and I'll.
**Shaun.hilbert**: I'll shut up and.
**Shaun.hilbert**: Lauren, continue.
**Shaun.hilbert**: But I would say for this week's client call, let's have some details on our SAT status.
**Shaun.hilbert**: I don't know if there's a dashboard or a list of scenarios or something, but let's just give an update on that percent complete and how we're tracking to that completion date.
**Shaun.hilbert**: And then I think this week would also be good to.
**Shaun.hilbert**: Okay, let's start talking about what UAT looks like.
**Shaun.hilbert**: We're here to support you.
**Shaun.hilbert**: We're starting on 811.
**Shaun.hilbert**: Barring any sit delays, we're starting UAT test materials you might need.
**Shaun.hilbert**: Let's just have that conversation and make that a focus because that way we can hold them accountable to supporting us and vice versa, to hitting these dates and tracking to that.
**Paul.wooldridge**: Go live.
**Paul.wooldridge**: Cool.
**Paul.wooldridge**: Thank you.
**Matthew.perry**: Thank you.
**Paul.wooldridge**: All right.
**Matthew.perry**: Excuse me.
**Matthew.perry**: New core mark development environment in place.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: That's something.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: Yeah, go ahead.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: I don't.
**Paul.wooldridge**: I don't.
**Greg.mcintosh**: Yeah, like, development server stood up I don't know what's all installed on there, but yeah, we can get that, you know, copied from production at some point.
**Matthew.perry**: Okay.
**Matthew.perry**: They're still working on field wiring for CCO2, so we know.
**Matthew.perry**: I don't know.
**Matthew.perry**: Where do you think we're at percentage wise, Mark?
**Lawrence.mitchell**: Did Mark drop?
**Matthew.perry**: That's what I was wondering.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: Yeah, I think he.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: He may have probably got a bad coverage area or something.
**Clayton.sprunck**: No, we're still here.
**Clayton.sprunck**: So, specifically, is what's this field wiring completion different than the one we talked about just a second ago for panel D?
**Clayton.sprunck**: This panel D, C, CO2?
**Matthew.perry**: I don't know.
**Matthew.perry**: Gary, can you answer that?
**Lawrence.mitchell**: I think CCO2, I think, is the exotect panel, right?
**Mark.huntsman**: Yeah, that's.
**Mark.huntsman**: That's the one.
**Mark.huntsman**: I would say we're probably at 50% at.
**Mark.huntsman**: So the one for the palletizer is complete.
**Paul.wooldridge**: Okay.
**Matthew.perry**: Are we still wiring the robot panel?
**Lawrence.mitchell**: I'm pretty sure that one's complete, too.
**Matthew.perry**: That was that big robot we were walking by, Right?
**Lawrence.mitchell**: The fanuc.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: That's the.
**Matthew.perry**: Okay.
**Matthew.perry**: Phase two controls debug.
**Matthew.perry**: I'd say we have a starter.
**Matthew.perry**: Phase two controls debug yet, because we're still working on phase one, right?
**Paul.wooldridge**: Yeah.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: And that one's the one.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: We've gotten, you know, some time on that.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: Definitely want to keep it moving, though, and get it done as fast as possible.
**Matthew.perry**: The comms exerciser mode.
**Paul.wooldridge**: Yeah, I don't.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: I don't think any of these.
**Matthew.perry**: Or started it.
**Greg.mcintosh**: Yeah, I haven't touched any phase two yet.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: Yeah, you can probably put.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: Not started on all that going down through there.
**Matthew.perry**: Okay.
**Greg.mcintosh**: Yeah, we're just trying to work through phase one right now.
**Matthew.perry**: Okay, I'll get that changed.
**Paul.wooldridge**: Okay.
**Matthew.perry**: Let me go ahead and pull up.
**Matthew.perry**: You want me to pull that spreadsheet up, Gary?
**Lawrence.mitchell**: Yeah, if you want to.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: What Lawrence is about to pull up, this is the testing plan for that we.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: It's really mimics what we.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: And you can go ahead and Click on that intro 1 scenario tests tab down there.
**Paul.wooldridge**: There we go.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: This is.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: Mimics what we did for both Houston and Salt Lake City.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: And I know you guys are already engaged in, you know, doing so testing for phase one.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: What I'd like to do is, like Ronnie said, we want to try to add some flesh to the bone.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: So really just two asks.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: One if you can go through here and take a look at this and see if there's any other content for that that is unique to Atlanta that we don't have listed on here in terms of test scenarios.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: If you can add that.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: And if you can scroll down Lawrence, and then also maybe add a column and just denote if it's phase one or phase two.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: If we're testing it in phase one, phase two, or both.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: If you guys can do that piece of it, then, you know, we'll.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: We'll create kind of a dashboard out of this and make it to where we can give some feedback to the customer on where we stand with sit.
**Greg.mcintosh**: And then.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: That way we.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: We have a little more specific information to share with them as opposed to, you know, just a percent complete overall.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: So I don't know, Alex, if that falls to you or maybe, maybe if Steven could do that, I don't know.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: But I think Stephen may have created some of the test scenarios for Salt Lake City.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: But anyway, just.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: Just two asks.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: One, add any test scenarios that are unique to Atlanta, which I don't know that there are any.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: I think everything's pretty well covered in Salt Lake City and there was some stuff left over in here from Houston.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: So add any unique scenarios to Atlanta.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: And two, just put a column in or add in the notes section that this is being tested in phase one or phase two or both.
**Greg.mcintosh**: Yeah, Gary, just go, just send me the link.
**Greg.mcintosh**: Send me what you want me to do and I can do it.
**Paul.wooldridge**: Okay.
**Matthew.perry**: Want me to flip through the rest of the gear?
**Lawrence.mitchell**: I think that that pretty well covers it.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: We can get together after this and we can maybe add a couple columns and just shoot it over to Alex and it shouldn't take him probably 15 minutes to do this.
**Matthew.perry**: Okay.
**Paul.wooldridge**: Yeah.
**Shaun.hilbert**: And Gary and Lawrence, this will.
**Shaun.hilbert**: This will be a work in progress until we go through phase two.
**Shaun.hilbert**: And we'll probably need to drop at least an extract of the customers UAT in here because that's kind of their functional sign off that they.
**Shaun.hilbert**: I guess you have it under customer functional test plan.
**Paul.wooldridge**: Yeah.
**Paul.wooldridge**: Yeah.
**Paul.wooldridge**: Okay.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: One question is Andy on.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: This is really more of a larger question.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: Andy said they were working on an overall test plan for this, and I didn't know if there was any update.
**Paul.wooldridge**: On.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: You know, overall testing plan or process and report back.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: Process.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: But I'll follow up with him on email on that.
**Greg.mcintosh**: Hey, Gary, there's a call.
**Greg.mcintosh**: There's a call Thursday, Gary, that we're gonna vet that out and have a final, you know, testing doc, so should have something later this week for you.
**Paul.wooldridge**: Okay.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: Yeah, I didn't know if it would be here in time for a core mark or not, so it should be.
**Greg.mcintosh**: I think we're gonna vet it out this week.
**Greg.mcintosh**: Clean it up and then we'll send it out.
**Greg.mcintosh**: So.
**Paul.wooldridge**: Okay.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: All right, Just some other little tidbits.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: We've got all the material ordered for the station extensions, the PCs and the atop controllers and the light bars and.
**Paul.wooldridge**: The.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: I think I sent a link over for the, the two different types of work tables, one for the PC and one for the printer.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: So all that's ordered except for those little tables and what I did when we were down there.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: I don't know who bought the printer tables for Salt Lake City.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: I bought.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: I went to Lowe's and got the, the little smaller breadcart tables to set the atop controllers and the, the PCs on.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: So let me know however we want to handle it.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: Those are low hanging fruit, so.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: But all that material is ordered and it should be.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: I'll let you know as soon as it ships.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: And then Mark and team have already created the unistrut structure for the light bars to go on.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: So I think all that.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: All that's in the works.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: Trying to think that there was a part that we were waiting on.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: The rectifier, I think.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: Is that.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: Am I saying that right?
**Lawrence.mitchell**: I think that's on site now.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: Has that been installed?
**Clayton.sprunck**: It's shipped ups.
**Clayton.sprunck**: We just need to track it and see where it is.
**Clayton.sprunck**: It was going to Gene's hotel.
**Paul.wooldridge**: Okay.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: And then there was.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: What about.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: And I'm sorry, Lawrence, I'm kind of taking over and just trying to catch up from being off for a week with some of this stuff.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: There were additional, I think wire decking or shelves that were ordered for the, for the code room.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: Did those make it there and get installed?
**Lawrence.mitchell**: Are we still.
**Clayton.sprunck**: Yeah, Mark.
**Clayton.sprunck**: Mark unloaded a pallet of wire deck today.
**Paul.wooldridge**: Okay.
**Matthew.perry**: And then the anchors were the last, last piece for the cold room, right?
**Paul.wooldridge**: Yeah.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: We just need JD to come back and do those wire decks and the anchors and we should be good.
**Clayton.sprunck**: And the floor angle.
**Clayton.sprunck**: The floor for the front of this part and flow.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: Do we, did we order that?
**Lawrence.mitchell**: Do we have the floor angle?
**Matthew.perry**: Yeah, they, they were ordered yesterday.
**Clayton.sprunck**: Mark said.
**Clayton.sprunck**: Yes, it's here.
**Matthew.perry**: Not here, ordered.
**Paul.wooldridge**: Okay.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: All right.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: Is there any other little kind of straggling items that I'm missing there.
**Kim.messer**: In.
**Clayton.sprunck**: Case anybody from the customer side points it out?
**Clayton.sprunck**: We've got some end plates for the trash line, some bottom pans, some other miscellaneous parts from mhs.
**Clayton.sprunck**: They're shipping a load today.
**Clayton.sprunck**: And then we'll have one more load with some additional bottom pans on it.
**Clayton.sprunck**: And then as we're running conveyor, we're Finding components that are either semi or non functional that we're getting replaced.
**Clayton.sprunck**: And I'm ordering that stuff all one off.
**Clayton.sprunck**: And it's being shipped overnight, so there's a lot of bibs and bobs, if you will.
**Paul.wooldridge**: Yeah.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: How about the.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: I saw the email traffic about the foot pedal and the controls for that.
**Clayton.sprunck**: Yeah, the, the control switches are here.
**Clayton.sprunck**: They're just on the, they're on the rack frame and not on the conveyor.
**Clayton.sprunck**: So we'll just point that out to the customer because it's, it's.
**Clayton.sprunck**: Once you see it, you know it's there.
**Clayton.sprunck**: But if you're not looking for it, it's easy to miss.
**Paul.wooldridge**: Okay.
**Shaun.hilbert**: Hey, I see Mark's on.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: I heard mention of his name.
**Shaun.hilbert**: Mark, is your last week this week or next week?
**Paul.wooldridge**: This week.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: That was the first question I asked.
**Shaun.hilbert**: I was late, darn it.
**Shaun.hilbert**: Yeah, I'll be.
**Shaun.hilbert**: Me and Gary got that GPC all day meeting on Tuesday.
**Shaun.hilbert**: I was gonna pop in there on Wednesday morning just to check in on things if anybody needs me to cover anything.
**Shaun.hilbert**: Who's the new guy gonna be?
**Shaun.hilbert**: Is that Israel?
**Mark.huntsman**: Yes.
**Paul.wooldridge**: Okay, cool.
**Paul.wooldridge**: Yeah.
**Shaun.hilbert**: Is he on these calls and see all.
**Shaun.hilbert**: Is he set up for success?
**Mark.huntsman**: He doesn't have teams or anything, but he'll be in contact with me still.
**Mark.huntsman**: And then Lawrence obviously has his number.
**Kim.messer**: And contact with himself.
**Paul.wooldridge**: Okay.
**Matthew.perry**: Yeah, and I'm gonna fly down Ronnie with the labor to help everybody get set up and then Israel can, can manage it.
**Paul.wooldridge**: Yeah.
**Shaun.hilbert**: Is that next week, Lawrence?
**Matthew.perry**: It'll be the, it'll be the 12th whenever we start.
**Paul.wooldridge**: Okay.
**Matthew.perry**: Morning of the 12th.
**Paul.wooldridge**: Okay.
**Paul.wooldridge**: All right.
**Shaun.hilbert**: Yeah, I'll check in with Israel when I'm there on Wednesday and looking forward to it.
**Matthew.perry**: See anybody else have anything to bring up today?
**Kim.messer**: So, Ronnie, I hear that you're going to be here.
**Kim.messer**: Sorry I had to step away several times.
**Kim.messer**: You're gonna be here next Monday, Wednesday morning.
**Kim.messer**: Okay.
**Shaun.hilbert**: Yeah, me and Gary got to do a. I think we're going to the GPC lab in Cartersville to check something and then I'll pop over there for a couple hours and then probably around midday I gotta start heading home.
**Kim.messer**: All right, that sounds fine.
**Kim.messer**: Gary Hagen, are you here on site today?
**Lawrence.mitchell**: I'm not.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: I'm in Louisville today.
**Kim.messer**: Okay.
**Kim.messer**: So is there anyone here from project management team?
**Lawrence.mitchell**: Not this week.
**Paul.wooldridge**: All right.
**Kim.messer**: Yeah, probably should line on some parts and stuff that I've missed on that.
**Kim.messer**: My apologies.
**Kim.messer**: So maybe have a side conversation about what's been ordered as far as compare components like motors, cards, photo eyes, et cetera, because we're coming up short on a few places, and our things are broken.
**Clayton.sprunck**: Hey, David, it's Greg McIntosh.
**Clayton.sprunck**: I'm here.
**Clayton.sprunck**: I'm in Mark's trailer right now, and everything that has been brought up is on site.
**Clayton.sprunck**: So if we're missing additional components, just let me know.
**Clayton.sprunck**: We'll get them on order.
**Paul.wooldridge**: Okay?
**Kim.messer**: Yeah, I think the best thing is to do a walk around and find out what's missing, what's broke, make a list, and then present that to the team.
**Kim.messer**: Does that sound fair?
**Paul.wooldridge**: Yeah.
**Shaun.hilbert**: And let's get that list published as well, because, Lawrence, we're in punch list mode.
**Shaun.hilbert**: You know, all these things we're missing if, you know, if we got to replace cards with mhs, whatever.
**Shaun.hilbert**: We need to start documenting that and tracking it and give the team a place to refer to this stuff.
**Shaun.hilbert**: That way we don't have five different versions of it floating around.
**Paul.wooldridge**: Cool.
**Shaun.hilbert**: Thanks.
**Lawrence.mitchell**: David.
**Kim.messer**: You're back.
**Matthew.perry**: All right, nothing else, then?
**Matthew.perry**: I'll get back a few minutes, then we'll reconvene.
**Matthew.perry**: Thanks, guys.
**Paul.wooldridge**: Cool.
**Paul.wooldridge**: Thanks.
**Kim.messer**: Thanks, everyone.
**Paul.wooldridge**: Bye.
**Greg.mcintosh**: Bye.
