## Transcript
**Ahuettl**: All right, so we'll get started on this.
**Ahuettl**: One thing.
**Ahuettl**: I want to ask everybody, and I meant to send it out to just have you, like everyone should read, you know, we have superintendent description for job.
**Ahuettl**: You know, job description, pm, all those.
**Ahuettl**: When's the last time you read through that?
**Bclymer**: Well, when we had the meeting initially about them.
**Ahuettl**: Okay.
**Ahuettl**: So it goes through the thing like core responsibilities, you know, those are what we're supposed to be doing.
**Ahuettl**: That's what a superintendent should be doing.
**Ahuettl**: So you should, you know, just always keep that in mind and do a refresh on that if you want to know what your standard job duties and job titles are.
**Ahuettl**: Okay, but question one.
**Ahuettl**: You feel like compensation is appropriate.
**Ahuettl**: You didn't say why.
**Ahuettl**: Why not?
**Ahuettl**: But I guess you don't have the issue with your current pay.
**Ahuettl**: The next one.
**Ahuettl**: Have you made costly mistakes or.
**Ahuettl**: So what were they?
**Ahuettl**: You mentioned burn bill about a dimension field dimension not being checked.
**Ahuettl**: And I would just like to say, like all these things when they say costly, like some of them are big, but every one of them, even the small ones adds up and it's costly.
**Ahuettl**: And just my observation, one of the biggest problems when mistakes happen and things don't get done and it causes the change orders and all that is just simply knowing what the drawings and the specs are on a project.
**Ahuettl**: And I'm just saying from personal experience, I would get to know those drawings day one, know what's on them.
**Ahuettl**: And I didn't really have to look at a drawing.
**Ahuettl**: I could walk a job site and look at something and be like, that's not right or something's missing.
**Ahuettl**: Because unless you're able to identify that stuff, things just happen and things go on and you have those mistakes.
**Ahuettl**: So that's one thing I would.
**Ahuettl**: You really need to work on is like, what eliminates these mistakes is knowing the drawings and, and knowing the specs, if there is any, and knowing what the submittals are, you know, on them.
**Ahuettl**: And that'll prevent a lot of mistakes from happening because you're going to catch it before it happens or as the subs are doing something, you're giving them direction so they're.
**Ahuettl**: They're not screwing up.
**Ahuettl**: I mean, our biggest job is to keep subs from screwing themselves over because even if they're paying for something, they're.
**Ahuettl**: They're really not.
**Ahuettl**: We are because our job gets delayed.
**Ahuettl**: So that's good.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah.
**Ahuettl**: Even on like the Neiman and Apply.
**Bclymer**: Like before we even had contracts, like.
**Ahuettl**: I was going through those and making sure I know then like the back of my hand.
**Ahuettl**: Okay, that's good.
**Ahuettl**: Done things above and beyond your position.
**Ahuettl**: Save the company money.
**Ahuettl**: So what were they?
**Ahuettl**: I mean, do you have, like, what's a specific example of one of these things, like, catching scope gaps early so we're not scrambling?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Like, even today or yesterday, I caught something on either Apply or Neiman's where it wasn't covered.
**Bclymer**: I told aj he's like, oh, yeah, good catch.
**Ahuettl**: Can't remember which one, what it was.
**Bclymer**: Exactly, but just stuff like that, just reviewing it, making sure that everybody's got what they're doing down, included.
**Bclymer**: So the key is above and beyond, because that.
**Bclymer**: That's part of your job.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, that's standard.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Like, otherwise, you know, paying a glorified babysitter.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: You know.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: People pay for their mind.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Ahuettl**: And on these projects coming up, like, you already have your.
**Ahuettl**: Your schedule and your planning and how you're protecting the walls and the floors and where does the demo start and stop?
**Ahuettl**: Like, all of those things in the beginning, if you don't have figured out and clearly, clearly set up, then you know it's going to come back and hurt you.
**Ahuettl**: Next was, what are you doing?
**Ahuettl**: Well, communicating, creating driving, project schedules, keeping subs on the same page.
**Ahuettl**: So, you know, again, a lot of this is our standard, you know, superintendent, like, things you do and, you know, one thing you know, you need to work on is if you are updating a schedule that has to be sent out to everybody the day the meeting's over or right afterwards.
**Ahuettl**: Because we can have meetings and if we don't take meeting minutes and have some notes, at least that we send out with the sub, meetings, like those should all be documented and sent out just so, you know, everyone will say something and forget it, and unless you document it, it doesn't.
**Ahuettl**: It just doesn't exist.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Ahuettl**: Are you able to use everything you need in Job Planner?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, things I've been talking with Glenn.
**Ahuettl**: About that we could talk to them about, which is like, get.
**Bclymer**: Like, you can't set up a folder for pictures and videos.
**Bclymer**: So, like, the only way to add pictures and videos would be to put them in through the daily logbook.
**Bclymer**: So just like small things like that.
**Ahuettl**: Well, I think we looked at that, and.
**Bclymer**: Other than that, chalk, LAN has been pretty good.
**Ahuettl**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: They'll get used to the drawings portion of it, but.
**Ahuettl**: Well, the drawings don't.
**Ahuettl**: It's not a whole lot different than Procore.
**Ahuettl**: I seem to think it's pretty easy to go in there and get them now.
**Ahuettl**: The.
**Ahuettl**: Glenn was having an issue.
**Ahuettl**: He just wasn't updating and adding revisions correctly so that you have the whole series of drawings in there.
**Ahuettl**: But yeah, that's what I was going.
**Bclymer**: Through with him the other day on just how to select a certain portion, like structural.
**Bclymer**: Like I was trying to update the structural for Neiman, but it wouldn't let me just do structural.
**Bclymer**: You had to do the whole set.
**Bclymer**: So I basically just had to delete everything and re.
**Ahuettl**: Redo it.
**Ahuettl**: Well, I don't think you had to delete it.
**Ahuettl**: And I'm not sure what was updated, but you just go in, you update it as a new set, and you're only importing the pages that were updated.
**Ahuettl**: And you just have to.
**Ahuettl**: It's just how you import them.
**Ahuettl**: And I know there's not good instructions on it and it's something you're gonna have to just ask, but those.
**Ahuettl**: Doing those things is possible.
**Ahuettl**: Not everything is.
**Ahuettl**: We found some things that they're not doing and we haven't work on it and fix it.
**Ahuettl**: But I know drawings like, you can go in and upload them.
**Ahuettl**: You can.
**Ahuettl**: You just have to go in and.
**Ahuettl**: And label them.
**Ahuettl**: You can label them to whatever set they are.
**Ahuettl**: And it's just a matter of you enter that material or that information in there when you're saving something, and then it allows you to just look at structural sets and just look at architectural sets.
**Ahuettl**: But it's.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I was obviously going to find just the structural part so that we could update and just have a relating for just that part.
**Ahuettl**: When you, you know, as you look at career advancement, like, you need to dial in everything as a superintendent.
**Ahuettl**: I mean, it's nice to be able to help in other things and learn those, but you need to become like the full package superintendent before you think, like, because until you can do that well and you can do any type of building or any type of construction, you're not like, you're not really a full superintendent.
**Ahuettl**: You know what I'm saying?
**Ahuettl**: You got to get that job experience and you got to like, go over and above to make sure, like, you know, I don't have to get asked to do a weekly report or a safety meeting or hold a schedule meeting.
**Ahuettl**: Those are things that you just, you yourself know they need to happen and you make them happen.
**Ahuettl**: And then we can just look at a simple report from job planner and say, yep, they're all happening.
**Ahuettl**: It's all taking place and it's good.
**Ahuettl**: So where can you improve.
**Ahuettl**: What's the next one?
**Ahuettl**: Paper trails using Email to document things.
**Ahuettl**: That's definitely true.
**Ahuettl**: Like I said, when you have a verbal conversation with anybody.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Ahuettl**: Document with an email and document it.
**Ahuettl**: Same thing with when you do your schedules and everything else.
**Ahuettl**: What do you like your manager does?
**Ahuettl**: Getting feedback.
**Ahuettl**: So that's good.
**Ahuettl**: Where can your manager improve?
**Ahuettl**: Delegate more tasks.
**Ahuettl**: That's what we say.
**Ahuettl**: Like when you ask for more tasks then everything that you're running should be 100% done and ready to go.
**Ahuettl**: Because the worst thing is when people like well I can give me another job.
**Ahuettl**: But they don't even have everything done on the job they're supposed to be doing.
**Ahuettl**: So that's not a help.
**Ahuettl**: So just make sure like if you want to expand and get more like show it.
**Ahuettl**: Have everything up to date and on track on the jobs you are running and then absolutely.
**Ahuettl**: Five years maybe someone others go to working through a problem.
**Ahuettl**: That's a noble.
**Ahuettl**: That's a noble endeavor.
**Ahuettl**: I would like it.
**Ahuettl**: They won't call me, they'll call you.
**Ahuettl**: I would be awesome.
**Bclymer**: What I'm getting at be like the Jesse.
**Ahuettl**: No, that's good.
**Ahuettl**: I learned everything I know from something up so you just have to.
**Ahuettl**: When something's messed up, you learn from it.
**Ahuettl**: You never do it again.
**Ahuettl**: Experiential learning.
**Ahuettl**: I mean.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah.
**Ahuettl**: How can I help you get there?
**Ahuettl**: You're talking about a lot of project management tasks and like I said I would, I would dial in on all the superintendent things like learning.
**Ahuettl**: Like you may not be on a ground up post tension project right now but you can certainly go research what's involved in them.
**Ahuettl**: Online's got everything or any other type of construction process.
**Ahuettl**: Like if you don't have the the good fortune to be on one of those jobs, you can certainly do research on your own.
**Ahuettl**: So when it comes up because as we keep growing we're getting bigger and more complex projects and that's on you.
**Ahuettl**: If you want to really learn and know what's going on then you just got to take the initiative for that.
**Ahuettl**: And.
**Bclymer**: Pretty often so I know what.
**Ahuettl**: He'S doing and asking questions on why they're doing things and.
**Bclymer**: Just learning even not being there.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah.
**Ahuettl**: You'll learn a lot from subs.
**Ahuettl**: I did too.
**Ahuettl**: I mean I always acted tom even if I knew what they were doing and just have them explain it to me.
**Ahuettl**: Just because there's a different way to do a lot of different things and just expands your knowledge of what the people are doing for you.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Ahuettl**: To.
**Ahuettl**: I mean yeah.
**Ahuettl**: Just problem solving.
**Ahuettl**: Making sure you, you know with everybody we, we're always here to help, but we want to make sure everyone's done their due diligence and tried to figure out a solution or have some options before.
**Ahuettl**: You always just make a call and say, well, here's a problem and put it on someone else.
**Ahuettl**: So.
**Bclymer**: So it's like the one, three, one rule.
**Bclymer**: So one problem, three solutions.
**Bclymer**: Here's my recommendation.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, we've talked about this before.
**Ahuettl**: I think this question was, what can I do better?
**Ahuettl**: So we talked about, you know, a lot of those things, you know, and, and any company like a gcs, like it's pretty much the same other than the salesman and the people that do the building, because everything else is pretty, you know, it's just the gc.
**Ahuettl**: So to make us the number one design build firm means we have to have the best superintendents and the best project managers that are actually building these things.
**Ahuettl**: And so that's why what you can do better is become the best superintendent there is.
**Ahuettl**: And that takes experience.
**Ahuettl**: That's what it takes.
**Ahuettl**: And, and it, it's not like I said, anyone can be a babysitter.
**Ahuettl**: I met hundreds of them in my career.
**Ahuettl**: They didn't give a shit what was going on.
**Ahuettl**: They sat in the trailer, played cards on a computer and yelled in sub meetings.
**Ahuettl**: They had no clue what was going on, didn't care.
**Ahuettl**: They were just there in a position.
**Ahuettl**: Or you can be the superintendent that looks at every detail, finds out exactly what it takes to do whatever they're building out there and understands what the subs are doing.
**Ahuettl**: Then you become a good superintendent and learn how to schedule, learn how to talk to people.
**Ahuettl**: And then when you're on our team, you're the person like, we just turn the job over to and then we can concentrate on other stuff.
**Ahuettl**: That's what will make us a great company.
**Ahuettl**: So that's what I.
**Ahuettl**: That would be my 2 cents.
**Ahuettl**: And Brandon can add his.
**Bclymer**: But it's just, the biggest thing is like, you know, can I.
**Bclymer**: Right?
**Bclymer**: C, A N I.
**Bclymer**: Constant and never ending improvement.
**Bclymer**: And so seeking out knowledge on your own instead of saying like, you know, oh, what do you need me to do?
**Bclymer**: Right?
**Bclymer**: Like, I can't tell you how many times I've heard that about you.
**Bclymer**: Where it's like, oh, well, he just asked, what do you need to do?
**Bclymer**: It's like, well, like, that's just a task, Rabbit.
**Bclymer**: Like, we need somebody who can think on their own and say, all right, like, ask the question, like, what needs to be done?
**Bclymer**: You know, what.
**Bclymer**: What can I improve on?
**Bclymer**: Like, Start to ask these questions of yourself.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, right.
**Bclymer**: And what I can do, what am I missing?
**Bclymer**: Right?
**Bclymer**: Like, looking at things like, what am I missing?
**Bclymer**: Like, we have the tools, you know, the Internet, like Jesse said.
**Bclymer**: I mean, hell, I taught myself how to do pool planning and lean scheduling through YouTube, literally.
**Bclymer**: That's how I did it.
**Bclymer**: I did a hospital job on it.
**Bclymer**: You know, I ran a pool planning session that I taught myself through YouTube videos.
**Bclymer**: And so there's all kinds of stuff that you can do and learn if you just seek out the knowledge.
**Bclymer**: That's how people do great.
**Bclymer**: They don't sit there and wait for somebody to say, here, do this.
**Bclymer**: They just do it.
**Bclymer**: They constantly are taking things off other people's plates, getting it done and getting it done effectively in a high quality grade.
**Bclymer**: Like just throwing something together, right?
**Bclymer**: Like throwing a schedule together, you know, And.
**Bclymer**: And then we look at it like, this is wrong.
**Bclymer**: This is wrong.
**Bclymer**: Like, all we're doing is checking work and saying, go back and do it again.
**Bclymer**: Like, instead, like, if things can be complete, done and ready, like, then that frees us up, right?
**Bclymer**: Like.
**Bclymer**: Like Nick, for instance.
**Bclymer**: I hardly ever talk to Nick, you know, or really interface with them, because every time that I do and I asked him the things, nine times out of 10, he's got it going.
**Bclymer**: Well, clients happy.
**Bclymer**: I don't have to worry about it.
**Bclymer**: And so I can go do other stuff, you know, versus other times.
**Bclymer**: There's people like, I constantly are like, is this done?
**Bclymer**: Is this done?
**Bclymer**: And I got to sit there and be their little secretary reminding them, like, that's.
**Bclymer**: That's the difference maker.
**Bclymer**: That's how you move up is like knocking stuff out at a high standard.
**Bclymer**: You know, One thing, you know, I can tell you is like.
**Bclymer**: Like leaving jobs, like, whether it's Burnville, you know, the.
**Bclymer**: With Goodwill, Bart, you know, whatever that was with the overhead stuff that Andrew had to go fix or whatever.
**Bclymer**: What was that, Jesse, was the above seal.
**Bclymer**: We messed something up.
**Bclymer**: We didn't see the drawings or what was it.
**Bclymer**: They wanted the ceiling wires taken down here.
**Ahuettl**: Like, I'm talking about the walls where they called all these walls to be topped out and they're painting and they had to go in and frame and top out those walls at Goodwill.
**Ahuettl**: And then we had electrical wires and stuff.
**Ahuettl**: Actually, the drywall's finished and painted and there's wires hanging out a foot below the ceiling.
**Ahuettl**: Like, those are things that, like, to allow that to happen is like, I don't even get it, you know, I don't Know how that gets to that point.
**Ahuettl**: And so that's what I'm saying is like, you couldn't.
**Ahuettl**: Either you don't know the drawings or you're not looking at what the subs are doing.
**Ahuettl**: You know, it.
**Ahuettl**: It's got to be one of the two, because I don't think you'd intentionally build a wall shorter or lower than the plans called for.
**Ahuettl**: Those are the things that, you know, those are mistakes.
**Ahuettl**: Like, you'd say, I'd never make let that happen again.
**Ahuettl**: I will, you know, on my next job.
**Ahuettl**: Like, that's where you can improve from that.
**Ahuettl**: But it just takes, you know, effort on your part to know the drawings and make sure you're walking the job every day and stuff like that's not happening.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah, sure.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I think, I think you have potential.
**Bclymer**: But like, you know, I.
**Bclymer**: I don't know if it's again, oversight, like thinking about something else, like, lack of work ethic, like, but same thing with Jesse.
**Bclymer**: I'm like, how does this happen?
**Bclymer**: When it's a 2,000, 3,000 square foot space, there's not that much.
**Bclymer**: I mean, shit, you know, I can look at the drawings once or twice and walk through and realize, like, what the fuck?
**Bclymer**: Why is this not like this?
**Bclymer**: Like, like that's, you know, like that's the kind of stuff where you, like that doesn't even meet standard.
**Bclymer**: Like, you have to be better about that, especially if you have these aspirations to grow.
**Bclymer**: Like, that's, you know, inexcusable.
**Bclymer**: Especially with somebody who's, you know, I, like, you know, two years ago, sure.
**Bclymer**: Coming for residual.
**Bclymer**: But you've been here almost three years now.
**Bclymer**: Like, I taught you this.
**Bclymer**: I know for a fact on several jobs, you know, and so it's like, like, that has to change otherwise, like, we just can't put you on anything but small little tis and babysit you.
**Bclymer**: Right?
**Bclymer**: But if you want to do a ground up, you know, like, like other ones that we have going on, imagine if, if you just didn't see and the footers were the wrong size.
**Bclymer**: You know, they're supposed to be six foot and they're five, you know, like, because there was an iteration that changed and you didn't check it.
**Bclymer**: Like, you know, that's literally today.
**Bclymer**: I was out this morning at Collective.
**Bclymer**: I said, have you.
**Bclymer**: Have you pulled measurements on these footers to cross check against the steel to make sure that we don't have some boo boo.
**Bclymer**: And steel shows up just like, yep, I already started, you know, checking these.
**Bclymer**: I've got these Guys going around checking them as they go.
**Bclymer**: Like, that's the kind of proactive stuff that has to happen.
**Bclymer**: You know, things that you can do, right?
**Bclymer**: So think of things like, you know, like checklist, right?
**Bclymer**: And I know I've mentioned this before.
**Bclymer**: Like, we, we sit there and we write SOPs and we do this, but we can only do so much because we've got other things to do, right?
**Bclymer**: It'd be different if everything was smooth sailing and we didn't have to jump in on different issues.
**Bclymer**: Right?
**Bclymer**: Like, but we do.
**Bclymer**: And so we can't always be like, all right, you know, let's take our knowledge and download it to this SOP of the proper way to do things.
**Bclymer**: Like, so, for instance, like, you can create things like, I'm never going to get mad at you being like, if you went and did your research and say, okay, what is a quality commercial GC superintendent?
**Bclymer**: Like, do, like, what are some key things they're going to say?
**Bclymer**: Safety schedule, all these kind of things.
**Bclymer**: Like, okay, what are some checklists and some things that can help me accomplish these tasks, you know, and you can start to put that together.
**Bclymer**: Like, so, for instance, like a site safety, site specific safety plan, right?
**Bclymer**: Like a superintendent should have those for every single one of the jobs.
**Bclymer**: Right?
**Bclymer**: Okay, what are we doing?
**Bclymer**: Right?
**Bclymer**: You know, we got this, this and this.
**Bclymer**: Like, okay, where are our risk issues?
**Bclymer**: Boom.
**Bclymer**: Like any kind of phasing plan, working hours, like, you know, being consistent with your toolbox talks.
**Bclymer**: Like, you know, a job startup checklist.
**Bclymer**: Like, anything like that that can help the next guy in line, right?
**Bclymer**: Like, as they're coming up, you know, think of it as, you know, a field engineer or whatever coming up.
**Bclymer**: Like, and he has to learn this stuff.
**Bclymer**: Like, instead of you just speaking it, like, you can start to build that, right?
**Bclymer**: And it can help other people in the company.
**Bclymer**: Like, so if you, that's what you have to think about.
**Bclymer**: Like, is think about this as like a ship.
**Bclymer**: Okay?
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: And, and you know, you can have the best fire control team out there, right, that can go out and think of that.
**Bclymer**: That's our sales, right.
**Bclymer**: They can go, there goes.
**Bclymer**: But if engineering can't get the props to turn, right, which is our operations side of things, it doesn't matter because you can't get to the fight.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And that's where we're at.
**Bclymer**: Right?
**Bclymer**: And you're, you're an engineer and you, you gotta get those propellers to move, you know, because it doesn't matter how much I go out and sell.
**Bclymer**: Like, hell Half the time, you know, I'm not making calls or anything because I'm like, I don't think we can pull some of this stuff off.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: And I don't want to be like that.
**Bclymer**: I want to be able to go out there and get more and keep growing, because that's going to help everybody.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Any other questions or anything?
**Ahuettl**: I don't have any more questions.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: So we're going to give you a raise, basically just to keep up for inflation.
**Bclymer**: So you're 89.
**Bclymer**: 5/650 truck is your truck allowance, right?
**Bclymer**: That's correct.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So we're giving you a $3,000 raise that pretty much just keeps up with inflation.
**Bclymer**: I mean, until we can see you hitting, like, the standards, like, the next six months, you know, when we sit back down or on Christmas or whatever, like, you know, my hope is that not only are you hitting the things you need to be hitting, but exactly, like, starting to bring value outside of that.
**Bclymer**: Because, like, right now, you know, you're sitting there, have this conversation, and, like, you are, you know, your performance is below standard, and that's like, you can't do that.
**Bclymer**: Like, you're way better than that.
**Bclymer**: You're smarter.
**Bclymer**: Like.
**Bclymer**: And I.
**Bclymer**: I hope that you take this and say, all right, like, I'm going to take this, and this is your career.
**Bclymer**: This is what you want to do.
**Bclymer**: Even if you say, in three years, you're like, fuck this place.
**Bclymer**: I'm going to go back out and start my own, or I'm going to go somewhere else.
**Bclymer**: Like, confidence.
**Bclymer**: Well, but any skill that you build, right, like, this is what we're talking about.
**Bclymer**: Like, this is your craft, and you want to be the best you can possibly be.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And so that's what my hope is, that you.
**Bclymer**: You take this and say, all right, this is a kick in the ass.
**Bclymer**: Like, I'm going to get this together.
**Bclymer**: Like, the feedback.
**Ahuettl**: Cool.
**Bclymer**: Did you guys see anything else?
**Ahuettl**: Yeah, no.
**Ahuettl**: I mean, all these things.
**Ahuettl**: That's all.
**Ahuettl**: That's all we want is to have the best.
**Ahuettl**: And you've worked here for several years, and it's just simply things you can do on your own to help you get there.
**Ahuettl**: And.
**Bclymer**: I hope 6 months stuff doesn't take.
**Bclymer**: Like, you know, I don't expect everybody to go home, like me, you know, or Jesse and fucking sit on the computer and constantly work.
**Bclymer**: Like, I don't expect that from everybody.
**Bclymer**: I get it.
**Bclymer**: We've done that for years.
**Bclymer**: We're fucking nuts.
**Bclymer**: Like, before I started this company, that's what we constantly do, you know, like.
**Ahuettl**: I've been there before.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And so.
**Bclymer**: But like one thing that you can do is, is there's this thing called net time.
**Bclymer**: So net, no extra time, right.
**Bclymer**: Which is pretty much the world we live in.
**Bclymer**: And so a great way to get better every day, right.
**Bclymer**: If you just think, how can I get a little bit better every day?
**Bclymer**: If that's your standard 1% better every day.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: And some days you won't hit it like we have.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Some days we have bad days.
**Bclymer**: I, I sure as though I have them.
**Bclymer**: And so if you say, what can I do to get better one day?
**Bclymer**: Just something as little as like in your commute, right.
**Bclymer**: So if you're driving from east side or what north side, where you on the east side, right?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah, east side to, you know, wherever.
**Bclymer**: Avon.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: That's a solid 30.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: To an hour.
**Bclymer**: Like, what are you like, more than likely you're either on the phone, but at 6:30, you probably not talking to that many people or you're listening to music.
**Bclymer**: Like one thing you can do is start to either listen to audiobooks or even like certain, you know, YouTube videos and you know, whatever that is that like knowledge base to grow.
**Bclymer**: Like imagine if you know, just for half the time, right?
**Bclymer**: One hour a day, a half hour there, half hour, the way back.
**Bclymer**: You did that every day, five days a week, right.
**Bclymer**: So you put in five to 10 hours of knowledge that you're gaining, you know, now you're starting your day off with, I'm learning something new and focusing on putting that practice multiply that, you know, times 40 weeks, right?
**Bclymer**: That's a ton of times.
**Bclymer**: Like imagine that, that mastery that you're getting.
**Bclymer**: So like, try to think of little things like that that are going to help you get better with how you doing, any extra energy so you don't listen to Joe Rogan or 97 1.
**Bclymer**: Who cares?
**Bclymer**: Cool.
**Ahuettl**: That's good.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, awesome.
**Bclymer**: Cool.
**Bclymer**: Well, this will hit July, so they all hit.
**Bclymer**: So awesome.
**Ahuettl**: Well, thank you, Jesse.
**Ahuettl**: All right.
**Ahuettl**: Thanks, Alex.
**Ahuettl**: Take you in.
**Ahuettl**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Two.
