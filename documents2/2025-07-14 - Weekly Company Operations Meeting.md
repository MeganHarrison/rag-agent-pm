**Fireflies**: I don't want to be the guy running any more projects.
**Fireflies**: So it just like this happens.
**Fireflies**: We get like.
**Fireflies**: Gets Buried.
**Jdawson**: Are we just missing sending close out documents to them guys?
**Fireflies**: No, that's.
**Fireflies**: So we've got.
**Fireflies**: So they.
**Fireflies**: The biggest thing is the.
**Fireflies**: So they added the fire alarm to us for the system.
**Fireflies**: So that's the.
**Fireflies**: Until the firearm gets closed, tied into the panels, we cannot get our final CO for the sprinkler system.
**Fireflies**: And so I. I got a change order that we need to input into Job Planner to send to fucking.
**Fireflies**: What's his name, Bill.
**Fireflies**: Because we initially.
**Fireflies**: They initially wanted us to run a shit ton of them.
**Fireflies**: Then it changed.
**Fireflies**: Now we're running less.
**Fireflies**: Whatever.
**Fireflies**: So I've got that number in here.
**Fireflies**: So Nick, can you make sure to show Alec how to enter change orders and stuff into Job Planner?
**Gducharme**: Mm.
**Fireflies**: And then he can enter this tomorrow morning.
**Fireflies**: So I've got to meet with paradise aisles at 8.
**Fireflies**: I don't know, Jesse, what you're doing.
**Fireflies**: I can afford you the invite.
**Fireflies**: We're going to run through the financials a little bit.
**Fireflies**: Do you know Jesse R. Sorry about that.
**Fireflies**: Do you know where you're at on the draw schedule?
**Jdawson**: I'm just finishing up 28 and 29.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Fireflies**: And make sure you front load around 100 million.
**Fireflies**: You know, first draw in January.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Fireflies**: That's six.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I'm good at eight.
**Jdawson**: And then me and Jesse this evening, we're gonna get together and work on a preliminary schedule.
**Jdawson**: Very high level.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Fireflies**: The goal is that we're going to have all of our stuff submitted by August 1st.
**Fireflies**: We submitted the executive summary and everything.
**Fireflies**: They said it was great.
**Fireflies**: They have very little comments, so.
**Fireflies**: Yeah, you know, it's almost concerning how good it's going.
**Gducharme**: But.
**Fireflies**: Yeah, right.
**Jdawson**: Talking to the general superintendent.
**Jdawson**: We need to run that behemoth, so.
**Fireflies**: Good, because we're going to need them quick, it looks like.
**Fireflies**: And then I'll talk to you later about this.
**Fireflies**: But we've got two more billion dollar jobs that I don't know why these things keep happening.
**Fireflies**: So everybody get ready to get busy.
**Bclymer**: Do it.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Kmass**: A.J.
**Ataylor**: I know.
**Kmass**: Nick.
**Ataylor**: Goodwill Crop Club office.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: Who should is responding to the city of Indianapolis.
**Njepson**: We got some comments back.
**Ataylor**: So this is due to July 7th.
**Ataylor**: You want to change it to.
**Kmass**: Nick?
**Ataylor**: Nick, can you hear me?
**Ataylor**: I think you left.
**Jmendez**: I think he left.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Fireflies**: Probably had diarrhea.
**Jremillard**: He's on the phone.
**Ataylor**: Same thing, Glenn.
**Ataylor**: Westfield Collective.
**Jmendez**: Westfield Collective has updated drawings that came out today with our door and window schedule finally completed.
**Jmendez**: So we can get storefronts ordered by Friday.
**Jmendez**: I got the H Vac guys working on getting repricing for providing the RTUs and they are already completed.
**Jmendez**: Actually Brandon, they didn't go into fab.
**Jmendez**: They are already done ahead of schedule.
**Jmendez**: So they're getting ready to ship somewhere.
**Jmendez**: He did speak with that supplier about them and got pricing for them.
**Jmendez**: They're 12, 5 each, 51,000 some change total.
**Fireflies**: Did we get an official number from Fight?
**Jmendez**: They still haven't emailed me.
**Fireflies**: No, I'd follow up with him because it sounds to me like he's got 25% on those units.
**Jdawson**: Well fight like, like thereby contract or like we're only going to pay him what we have left after we deduct what the new guys cost is so we can start there.
**Jdawson**: And I don't know how much you want to fight those guys but they can either give them to them, that's when we'll find out what they're at cost is.
**Fireflies**: Yeah, I mean what I, what I, what needs to happen is I need to know cost timeline for curbs from this other guy.
**Fireflies**: So now we know it's 51000 bucks.
**Fireflies**: You know what's the timeline on the curbs and the units?
**Jdawson**: But the curbs are all by our steel manufactured building guys.
**Jdawson**: So we have no curbs.
**Jdawson**: As soon as the units show up.
**Fireflies**: Perfect.
**Fireflies**: So then.
**Fireflies**: Yeah, so then, so we know that.
**Fireflies**: We know that all our risk essentially is that $51,000 because I'm not going to pay fight for the 25 for the design or whatever that is.
**Fireflies**: But the only way to capture that 25 from them since the our new number is more than theirs.
**Fireflies**: I've got to get her to write me a check which isn't going to happen and I'm not going to sue her for 50 grand.
**Fireflies**: So I'll talk to her, you know, once.
**Fireflies**: Do you have a lead time going on the units?
**Jmendez**: He, he doesn't have it yet.
**Jmendez**: All he, all he gave me was the pricing that he got verbally from him and he was just updating me that he was working on it.
**Jmendez**: He also reached out to carrier and I think another manufacturer to, to check on other pricing to see what you.
**Gducharme**: Know, if we can get.
**Jdawson**: I thought they said, I thought they said the units were going to be delivered from the factory the end of this month, 1st of August.
**Jmendez**: What she told me was that they go into Fab on the 11th and then it will be two to three weeks from there.
**Jmendez**: And when Jeff just contacted the company that is making them, whatever the heck.
**Fireflies**: Their name is, he said distributor?
**Jmendez**: Yeah, they're.
**Jmendez**: They're already made.
**Fireflies**: They're Already on what, what they'll do, Jesse, is that they're made hay.
**Fireflies**: Baker will take them to their shop, their distribution center, and then they'll wait for when they're supposed to deliver them to the site.
**Fireflies**: The issue is more than likely, like, if I'm fight, you know, I'm not going to deliver those units, you know, unless I know I'm going to get paid for them.
**Fireflies**: I, you know, I just send them back.
**Fireflies**: Because if she delivers them, it's like, yeah, I'm not going to pay you for them.
**Fireflies**: Good luck.
**Fireflies**: But yeah, I mean, at the end of the day, like, it's, it's going to be a little messy.
**Fireflies**: We're going to take a hit.
**Fireflies**: You know, I doubt that she's going to be like, okay, yeah, we'll just get the units delivered and you pay us the, you know, ten thousand dollar difference.
**Fireflies**: But maybe, I mean, we'll see.
**Fireflies**: Now that, now that I know this, you know that we have this other option.
**Fireflies**: Tomorrow I'll call their president and talk to him.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we're letting them off easy if we just agree to pay for them units.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Fireflies**: Well, I mean, if, if they're going to ship them and give them to us, I, I'm not going to pay for them.
**Fireflies**: No.
**Fireflies**: But what I think is going to happen is that she's gonna be like, well, I'm not going to ship the units.
**Fireflies**: Like, you know what I mean?
**Fireflies**: Because they're still their units, their order.
**Fireflies**: And so she's not going to ship them because I'm going to be like, look, here's the Delta, right?
**Fireflies**: It's, you know, 50,000 bucks.
**Jdawson**: You know, I would tell them also that we reached out to someone else because our other two quotes were a hundred thousand more.
**Jdawson**: I wouldn't act like we knew they were way off, but just tell them, you know, we got a hundred thousand less in our cost that we could have just.
**Jdawson**: It had been no point in even talking to them.
**Jdawson**: It'd just be.
**Jdawson**: Take them to court and they'd lose in a second on it.
**Fireflies**: Yeah, yeah, I'll, I'll, I'll loop you in on the call tomorrow.
**Gducharme**: Right.
**Fireflies**: You know, I just.
**Fireflies**: The biggest thing is I want to avoid means in court because it's just a pain in the ass.
**Fireflies**: We're going to settle outside of it anyway.
**Fireflies**: We're going to come up with pennies on the dollar.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: And then also everything.
**Ataylor**: Glenn, I know you said something about the tapping out ceremony.
**Ataylor**: Was that fixed?
**Ataylor**: You said it was needed to be Done by today.
**Ataylor**: Monday.
**Jmendez**: The tent needed to be ordered by today and it was.
**Kmass**: Okay, perfect.
**Ataylor**: And then we need photographers for that day.
**Ataylor**: Correct.
**Jdawson**: Confirming what you just.
**Jmendez**: What did you say?
**Ataylor**: We need photographers for that day.
**Jmendez**: Oh, photographers.
**Jmendez**: I. I don't know.
**Jmendez**: Brandon, do you want to do a photographer again?
**Ataylor**: Okay, I'll reach out to the photographer we had.
**Jmendez**: No, I said, brandon, do you want to do a photographer again?
**Ataylor**: He said yes.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, he said yes.
**Ataylor**: So I will reach out to the.
**Fireflies**: Girl and then don't use that same one.
**Ataylor**: You don't like it.
**Ataylor**: You didn't like her?
**Fireflies**: No, she did terrible at.
**Fireflies**: Remember we could didn't have any audio, no video.
**Fireflies**: She looks terrible with the topping out videos.
**Bclymer**: For a second, Brandon, I thought you were talking about me because I was taking a couple photos.
**Fireflies**: Yeah, we had two terrible photographers.
**Ataylor**: Okay, I'll check that and then.
**Ataylor**: One second, I'll check that on my end.
**Ataylor**: And then also yeah, I talk to Andrew with some other things.
**Fireflies**: Did you get a taller tent, Glenn?
**Jmendez**: I'm not sure.
**Jmendez**: And Ian ordered it and the guy sent me back a estimate and I asked him why it didn't say that.
**Jdawson**: Let me see.
**Jmendez**: Send a revised with taller walls.
**Fireflies**: Well, just make sure.
**Jmendez**: Nine foot six walls.
**Jmendez**: Yes.
**Fireflies**: How tall are they?
**Jmendez**: They're nine foot six.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Jmendez**: Ian or Andrew didn't catch it when.
**Jdawson**: We did that, Alex.
**Jdawson**: So if you decided to go, you could fit under the tent.
**Fireflies**: Is candid in the office down there, Jesse?
**Jdawson**: No, he's finishing up our cherry job today.
**Fireflies**: We're gonna have to make him play one on one for that office.
**Kmass**: Okay, perfect.
**Ataylor**: Thank you, Glenn.
**Ataylor**: We have Brandon Core Mark to exotech.
**Jdawson**: That one's done, isn't it?
**Jdawson**: Or is there a change order for that one too?
**Fireflies**: Well, there's.
**Fireflies**: Not only is there a change order, but also there is the firearm is not done still.
**Fireflies**: And so we have to have that to close the permit.
**Fireflies**: So I asked Alex Hle to follow up and let me know where the hell that's at because it's just sitting there.
**Jdawson**: Alex Hill is who?
**Fireflies**: The superintendent that works for us.
**Jdawson**: Oh, Hudo.
**Jdawson**: I think he said Hill.
**Gducharme**: Hill.
**Jdawson**: It's hittle, not Hudel.
**Fireflies**: I don't know, dip.
**Fireflies**: Whatever.
**Bclymer**: It's.
**Bclymer**: It's hittle, but he responds to dip.
**Jdawson**: Good.
**Jmendez**: Hey Brandon, real quick, for the ceremony we have a 30 by 60 tent and about 80 people so far.
**Jmendez**: Would you.
**Jmendez**: You want us to look into getting the speaker this time?
**Jmendez**: The microphone and speaker setup?
**Jmendez**: We didn't use it last time.
**Fireflies**: Yeah, if you're gonna Do a raffle and stuff?
**Fireflies**: Yeah, for sure.
**Fireflies**: You can just get a simple one.
**Fireflies**: It's not a.
**Jmendez**: The.
**Fireflies**: I, I have it.
**Fireflies**: I used to have a big speaker until AJ lost the power cord a little bit.
**Jmendez**: JJ Chamber of Commerce provided it for us last time.
**Jmendez**: I'll reach out to them.
**Jmendez**: Have you already reached out to them?
**Jmendez**: I, I, well, no, I hadn't asked him or talked to him about it yet.
**Jmendez**: I don't, I, I didn't.
**Jmendez**: Maria, did you.
**Fireflies**: I mean, Katie's got one, doesn't she?
**Jmendez**: I mean, they have, they have a PA system there, but it's all hooked up to the, like, it's all wired up to the posts and the speakers.
**Fireflies**: I would ask Katie if she's got a, you know, speaker with a mic.
**Fireflies**: They may, well may have one.
**Jmendez**: Maria, did you reach out to the Chamber of Commerce at all on this?
**Jmendez**: I think I told you not to.
**Ataylor**: But no, we, I haven't typically.
**Fireflies**: Typically you wouldn't.
**Fireflies**: I mean, Jesse, correct me if I'm wrong, I've never seen chamber show up to a topping out.
**Jdawson**: This is more for the workers than anybody.
**Jdawson**: And if the owner wants to show up, great.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Fireflies**: So, yeah, I wouldn't reach out to any, any Westfield governmental agencies.
**Gducharme**: Got it.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Okay, so this is changed to a leg.
**Ataylor**: Nick Spires.
**Ataylor**: Is he back?
**Ataylor**: I think so, yeah.
**Njepson**: We're waiting on owner payment.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: AJ Neiman holding FedEx.
**Bclymer**: I am currently responding to two of their.
**Bclymer**: We have two comments left on the ADLS permit and I just submitted them.
**Bclymer**: So I'm hoping that that gets us our permit this week.
**Bclymer**: We just went ahead and started.
**Bclymer**: We were able to get our 10 foot six sticks of steel in the building.
**Bclymer**: So today we actually started the reinforcement even without a permit.
**Bclymer**: Just because as soon as they send us that permit, then we can go ahead and cut our openings and start getting material in the building that we can't fit in as of right now.
**Bclymer**: So hopefully this week we'll actually get the full release.
**Bclymer**: Glenn, you, you thought Westfield was bad?
**Bclymer**: That CARMEL this ADLS amendment sat in their court for 35 days.
**Jmendez**: What, you're talking about permitting for Westfield?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I'm talking.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I'm talking about pro reading for Caramel on this one.
**Jmendez**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jmendez**: I mean, Westfield did pretty quick and we were.
**Jmendez**: Wait, we ended up being waiting on access and CDR stuff.
**Fireflies**: What else?
**Fireflies**: On Neiman.
**Bclymer**: That's it.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Fireflies**: Have you talked to Corey?
**Bclymer**: Corey's gone, Brandon.
**Fireflies**: No, I just didn't know if you talked to him since at all.
**Bclymer**: No, I Texted him.
**Bclymer**: I haven't.
**Bclymer**: I haven't really tried to follow up with him in the last week and a half, but I want to figure out where he's.
**Bclymer**: He's moving to, but hoping to use it as a chance to get Rich himself in on the meetings.
**Bclymer**: That would be huge.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Sean did say in the last meeting she was like, I'm really relying on you guys to finish this one strong.
**Bclymer**: And so she's still there.
**Bclymer**: So we do good with this.
**Bclymer**: Hopefully that gets us more perfect.
**Ataylor**: AJ Denville Theater.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I met with Andres this morning, so I need to get him a contract today.
**Bclymer**: And he's going to start ripping and roaring on everything this week.
**Bclymer**: So while I'm out here at Avon, I'll be able to at least keep an eye on things out there.
**Kmass**: Thank you.
**Ataylor**: AJ this is also your apply engineer office remodel.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: So we have in wall rough in this week.
**Bclymer**: We're going to do an owner walk through Friday morning before we close up the walls.
**Bclymer**: Other than that, everything's going smoothly.
**Bclymer**: I'm still waiting on electrical submittals.
**Bclymer**: I've got half of the H VAC submittals right now.
**Fireflies**: And you had some samples show up to the office today.
**Fireflies**: Can case work?
**Bclymer**: Did I?
**Gducharme**: Yep.
**Fireflies**: You put them on your desk.
**Fireflies**: Okay, I'll.
**Bclymer**: I'll run by.
**Bclymer**: I. I gotta get something to Glenn tomorrow.
**Bclymer**: A notary.
**Bclymer**: So I'll swing by tomorrow and pick him up.
**Jmendez**: I thought you were just emailing that.
**Fireflies**: No, just.
**Bclymer**: No, I am gonna email that.
**Bclymer**: I'll have Alex pick it up.
**Bclymer**: Brandon, I don't need to pick it up.
**Ataylor**: Okay, Glenn.
**Ataylor**: No, sorry, Jesse.
**Ataylor**: Seminole Collective.
**Fireflies**: See, I talked to Mike today.
**Fireflies**: Okay, so they sent their contract.
**Fireflies**: The city did.
**Fireflies**: Mike Mark redlined it.
**Fireflies**: And they didn't really have any issues with any of the red lines, so they've sent it back to their attorney.
**Fireflies**: They canceled the next meeting.
**Fireflies**: So while their attorney is looking through it.
**Fireflies**: So I think it'd be August 5th is the next meeting, but it looks like it's.
**Fireflies**: It's going to move forward.
**Fireflies**: Obviously the timeline is adjusting.
**Gducharme**: Good.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we had that meeting last week with the city and they're also supposed to send us the update on the like property and getting more land for the storm.
**Jdawson**: Storm detention area from the county.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: See, and I guess you said.
**Ataylor**: What did you say about the area with accounting?
**Fireflies**: No, nothing with accounting.
**Fireflies**: He was talking about storm detention.
**Fireflies**: But you don't need to put that.
**Fireflies**: You don't need to put that in there.
**Fireflies**: Just say next meeting in August.
**Fireflies**: That's fine.
**Kmass**: Okay, perfect.
**Ataylor**: Next one we have Nick Brandon.
**Ataylor**: Sorry, Pro Collective.
**Fireflies**: Reassign that to Jesse R, please.
**Fireflies**: So in my meeting I got a meeting with, I had a short meeting today with Mike about that job.
**Fireflies**: He's going to call me tomorrow I think to go in depth more.
**Jdawson**: Did Jesse, Jesse, did you get the meeting minutes with all the items?
**Fireflies**: Yeah, he sent them to me.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Fireflies**: So the biggest thing is this condo situation.
**Gducharme**: It.
**Fireflies**: So correct me if I'm wrong Jesse, but if we label them as condos, let's say we do whatever, 15 condos, then the issue is that we have to have a condo association do all these third party inspections and everything.
**Fireflies**: Correct?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, it's, it's that, it's the liability goes up because of you get sued from condo association.
**Jdawson**: It's different requirements for everyone.
**Jdawson**: Builder and design team.
**Fireflies**: Okay.
**Fireflies**: So I, I mentioned that to them and so what I had talked to Mike about was just doing apartments, you know that, that way they, we don't have to worry about that.
**Fireflies**: And if for some reason we can't do that.
**Fireflies**: The other thing we're thinking of is, you know, we, we build the hotel and then a connection is like townhomes or something like that.
**Fireflies**: That way it clearly, you know, it's, we don't have to worry about condo association.
**Fireflies**: We do townhomes and it still meets the requirement for the lender.
**Jdawson**: Okay, and did he say anything about the size of it?
**Jdawson**: Are they set with 60?
**Fireflies**: No, he's, he, he doesn't.
**Fireflies**: That was just a number we pulled out of our ass.
**Fireflies**: So I guess that the thought is what, what does the number need to be like what would we suggest does, do we know what that is?
**Jdawson**: Is that 80 or what saying?
**Jdawson**: I think.
**Jdawson**: Who said a hundred, like a hundred rooms is like a, there's 100 or 120 is like a minimum usually a hotel once.
**Jdawson**: And you know, if we get rid of the condos too, like you can fit that extra 40 hotel rooms in the two floors that we're going to.
**Jdawson**: You know, just because the condos are so much bigger.
**Jdawson**: So it, it's easier.
**Fireflies**: What does that, what does that do to our pricing?
**Jdawson**: I mean it's more bathrooms, but it's less, kind of less of everything else because you just have carpet and a bathroom.
**Jdawson**: So I can look at it, we can look at that.
**Fireflies**: Yeah, I just that that the big, the biggest thing is when we back into a number like that because the, where Paul is letting us take the land and collateralize it with the loan and so we back into a number to say the land is worth, you know, whatever.
**Fireflies**: This was like 4 million or something like that.
**Fireflies**: He's going to lend us 90 to 90 to 10 which is how we got to the 40 million number.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I think we had a high number for building a hotel.
**Jdawson**: If we're figuring 10 million for the container area then we can probably get to that higher number.
**Jdawson**: So look at the.
**Jdawson**: Jesse, we'll look at that.
**Jdawson**: I feel like I'm talking to myself all the time now.
**Jdawson**: Third person.
**Fireflies**: I mean Jesse, we didn't want to say this but you kind of been doing that for a while.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Jesse said this and Jesse said that.
**Jdawson**: And you're like golly, this guy's an.
**Fireflies**: Just wonder.
**Ataylor**: Thank you guys.
**Ataylor**: Goodwill Tremont.
**Kmass**: We have Nick.
**Njepson**: I believe that's there with Brandon and Jared.
**Fireflies**: I told Jared, let me see if he emailed me.
**Jdawson**: I gotta get with and see if Andrew asked if the framer would take half off his price to get his logo in there.
**Jdawson**: Because Glenn Mark, he asked me how much that would cost him because I said that was a.
**Jdawson**: They were asking the subs to donate and he asked how much it would take to get his name in there to take off of it.
**Jdawson**: So I just.
**Jdawson**: Nick, what is his number?
**Jdawson**: What is the actual like of framing materials and labor?
**Jdawson**: What is his number?
**Jdawson**: Do you know?
**Njepson**: Not offhand.
**Jdawson**: Put that together for me so I can call up Greg.
**Ataylor**: 415Q Nick Keva Uniclo.
**Jremillard**: Yes.
**Jremillard**: We have the electrician back on site this week and they're.
**Jremillard**: They double up the amount of people they have on site today.
**Jremillard**: So they are moving along with the feeder installs and they're getting ready to install the panels.
**Jremillard**: We also have the plumbers on site today.
**Jremillard**: They are mobilizing today to start floor demo and we had a meeting with exotic this morning.
**Jremillard**: They would have someone on site this week and next week they're.
**Jremillard**: They're going to start delivery of their material.
**Fireflies**: That's a week ahead of schedule.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Fireflies**: Where are we at?
**Fireflies**: You know.
**Fireflies**: So here's the issue.
**Fireflies**: They're going to start erecting that as soon as they get it.
**Fireflies**: Where we at on bulk pipe and branch lines and heads to get on site.
**Jremillard**: So they.
**Jremillard**: Michael is ready to install them.
**Jremillard**: Sorry.
**Jremillard**: Deliver them for us whenever we are ready.
**Fireflies**: Just wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
**Fireflies**: So you're telling me the branch lines are already fabricated?
**Jremillard**: They are or they're not fully fabricated but they've been working on it.
**Fireflies**: But do we know when they're going to be fabricated.
**Jremillard**: I believe they should be starting by the end of this week.
**Fireflies**: And wait a minute, they're going to start fabricating by the end of this week?
**Gducharme**: Correct.
**Fireflies**: So then they can't deliver them whenever we want.
**Jremillard**: They can't what?
**Fireflies**: So then they can't deliver them whenever we want.
**Fireflies**: Because if I want them delivered on Thursday, sorry, we haven't started fabrication well.
**Jremillard**: Ahead of our installation.
**Jremillard**: They are ready to, to deliver them.
**Fireflies**: So here's the thing.
**Fireflies**: I can tell you from experience.
**Fireflies**: They're going to get their material on site and they will start standing up that racking ASAP.
**Fireflies**: So even though their schedule calls for the 13th, whatever that is, you know, if their material comes in early and they've got a crew there, they'll start standing it up.
**Fireflies**: So you need to figure out when we can get our first tranche of piping delivered.
**Fireflies**: Not only do you have to, you need to get it delivered.
**Fireflies**: You need to get like the first three aisles, you know, in that section B delivered.
**Fireflies**: Because you also need to have Mike on site go through and cross check everything to make sure it's the correct pipe.
**Fireflies**: Because if they send us pipe and it's for the wrong, we're sitting there useless.
**Fireflies**: So you want to make sure that you have that pipe there, you know, a week in advance, at least minimum to start checking everything.
**Fireflies**: Then you also need to dope the heads.
**Fireflies**: Like, you got to get all this stuff ahead of time.
**Fireflies**: Because if you get it delivered the day before and if something's missing, then we're screwed because this has to go up concurrently.
**Jdawson**: All right, and then have you, have.
**Fireflies**: You, have you talked with Adelphia about cruise.
**Jremillard**: In terms of what this, the crew size?
**Fireflies**: Well, no, about.
**Fireflies**: Hey, here's what we're looking at for start date.
**Fireflies**: You got your crew.
**Fireflies**: How many people, like, you know, we need to get guys here ahead of time to dope heads.
**Fireflies**: Stage start a bulk main.
**Fireflies**: That's going to happen before branch lines like that bulk main and that 3 inch should all be ran before they stand up.
**Fireflies**: Racking.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, I am talking to Jesse every day since last week.
**Fireflies**: All right, well, you need to get that bulk there so that they can go ahead and start installing that.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Fireflies**: You need to get the bulk and the three inch there.
**Fireflies**: The verticals should not be fabricated until we get branch lines in.
**Fireflies**: And then you can go in and measure it and then get the rest of the 3 inch fabricated and they'll put those in later.
**Jremillard**: Gotcha.
**Jremillard**: So I do have one change order to process for uniqlo we are over the allowance for the permit, so there are two charges.
**Jremillard**: One was, I think, from your credit card.
**Jremillard**: Brandon, I sent you an email if you can let me know what that was for.
**Fireflies**: Maria, buy that form, please.
**Ataylor**: You sent it when, Keva?
**Kmass**: Today?
**Jremillard**: No, I sent it last week.
**Jdawson**: I'll.
**Jremillard**: 42.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, send it to me and I'll make sure.
**Kmass**: We'll find out.
**Ataylor**: What is it?
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: What else from Uniqlo?
**Jremillard**: Keva, I think that is it for now.
**Kmass**: Okay, thank you.
**Ataylor**: AJ Memphis call Storage Phase two.
**Bclymer**: Got a meeting with the White House next week.
**Bclymer**: Barring nothing crazy, I saw an email from the CEO of CART himself saying have H VAC and electrical ready to go.
**Bclymer**: So I would think at the end of next week, we're gonna find out if we're full go or not.
**Bclymer**: Brandon and Jesse.
**Bclymer**: Jesse Dawson.
**Bclymer**: Have you guys heard anything other than that?
**Fireflies**: No.
**Fireflies**: But I owe Steve a call.
**Fireflies**: He tried to hit me up when I was in Europe.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Kmass**: Okay, thank you.
**Ataylor**: AJ Glenn, Goodwill Foundations.
**Jmendez**: Goodwill Foundations has electricity finishing up this week.
**Jmendez**: I have a change order pending with the owners for the stuff that they wanted to add during our walkthrough last week.
**Jmendez**: As soon as I get that, we should be able to finish up the rest of the electrical on the ground level, get painting in there next week, flooring in there after that, and we will be wrapped up unless they add any more cabinets and countertops.
**Kmass**: Okay, thank you, Glenn.
**Kmass**: Keva.
**Ataylor**: Radial.
**Ataylor**: Martinsville.
**Jremillard**: Still on hold, but I'm actually flying there this week to.
**Jremillard**: Because they wanted to add a little more scope.
**Jremillard**: So there's a lot.
**Jdawson**: That's a different job, Keva.
**Jdawson**: This is a new one you're going there for.
**Jdawson**: Is they're moving a Godiva from a different facility altogether into that building.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Jesse Dawson.
**Bclymer**: Are we going to want to create a totally separate job for that or keep it all under Martinsville?
**Jdawson**: Sounds like it's.
**Jdawson**: It's not the same.
**Jdawson**: I was from his email and I haven't talked to JP about it, but he said they want to move a different facilities things to their building.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, I think right now they're currently in the same building that we are moving they're moving Amex into.
**Jremillard**: So I think they're moving from that to a different building.
**Fireflies**: Are you going to be able to go there and talk to a client and handle this?
**Gducharme**: Yes.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, Kevin, you can call me too when you walk through since we'll.
**Bclymer**: We'll be working on it together.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Fireflies**: You need to.
**Fireflies**: You need to be Briefed ahead of time and know what you're talking about because JP's gonna ask questions, so.
**Fireflies**: AJ, Brandon, JP's here?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, JP's here with me.
**Gducharme**: We're.
**Bclymer**: We're gonna.
**Bclymer**: Once I'm done here on this call, I gotta.
**Bclymer**: We're powwowing every day at the end of the day, so I'll get with JP and we'll find out a little more.
**Bclymer**: Kevin, when do you fly out?
**Jremillard**: Tomorrow afternoon at 5, but.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: He.
**Jremillard**: He's not going to be there.
**Jremillard**: He gave me the information, I think.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, it's just with whoever that site director is.
**Fireflies**: Oh, okay.
**Fireflies**: That's good.
**Bclymer**: So JP's here in Indy until.
**Gducharme**: Shoot.
**Bclymer**: Assuming tomorrow everything goes well.
**Bclymer**: He's here till Thursday.
**Gducharme**: All right.
**Fireflies**: Figure out.
**Fireflies**: I don't know, probably, maybe, I don't know, either Tuesday or Wednesday on dinner.
**Bclymer**: Aj, say that again?
**Fireflies**: I said ask him what's better, Tuesday or Wednesday for dinner.
**Gducharme**: Okay, I will.
**Bclymer**: I'm gonna.
**Bclymer**: I'm gonna assume it's gonna be Wednesday because tomorrow Amazon's gonna be here all day.
**Bclymer**: So I would plan on that.
**Bclymer**: And I'll just tell them Wednesday.
**Gducharme**: All right.
**Jdawson**: They.
**Jdawson**: You know, these jobs seem like they're splitting them all up because now they want to change the American Express cage from the other, you know, the IT closet and that.
**Jdawson**: And then the demo is its own thing, and.
**Jdawson**: And then actually the cage is another.
**Jdawson**: And then this is a Godiva.
**Jdawson**: So it almost needs to be four jobs, I would think.
**Jdawson**: So we're not trying to split them up later.
**Jdawson**: If they want to combine them, fine.
**Jdawson**: But I can see them happening at different times, it seems like.
**Bclymer**: And they'll probably issue four separate POs, because that tells me that they're pulling from different pools of money.
**Fireflies**: Well, the separate POS doesn't really mean anything.
**Fireflies**: They do that for every change order.
**Gducharme**: Right.
**Fireflies**: But the timing, I guess, is what we really need to figure out, to Jesse's point, because if one's going to happen, you know, and be done mid August, and then the next one's not going to happen until December.
**Fireflies**: Right.
**Fireflies**: We don't want to just keep stuff open, but if it's the same building, you could do change orders and stuff.
**Fireflies**: So see what information you can find out from jp.
**Fireflies**: And he's calling.
**Bclymer**: He's calling me right now, so.
**Fireflies**: All right, take it.
**Bclymer**: I'll text him.
**Bclymer**: He's probably just looking for me.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Something here that we need to change.
**Ataylor**: So this is for a different job, but still nothing here.
**Jremillard**: No, nothing changes for now.
**Fireflies**: Well, I mean, the biggest thing is you need, you know, one thing to put on there is confirm if we're going to do a separate job or not for this scope.
**Jdawson**: He's already told us to split up the work of the cage from the rest of it.
**Jdawson**: So do you have that pricing ready, Jesse?
**Bclymer**: I'm gonna get with JP and find out exactly what he wants and we'll do that.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Because I think he was just trying to figure out how much it costs.
**Fireflies**: Yeah, I think he just wants to split out separately.
**Fireflies**: I don't know if he necessarily cares if it's a different job or not, but just talk to him, see what he says.
**Gducharme**: I will.
**Bclymer**: I'm looking for him.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: GPC Harrisburg.
**Ataylor**: You want to be Alec or.
**Fireflies**: Yeah, I'll have to run that.
**Fireflies**: So, talked with Sam today.
**Fireflies**: We should have.
**Fireflies**: Biggest thing is we're waiting on High Tech to give us the backgrounds for the racking so that we can finish the high robotic system.
**Fireflies**: You know, Alec, you need to follow up with Chris Lopez and see where he's at on design for the sprinkler system for the, for the static racking.
**Fireflies**: And then as soon as, as soon as we get that background, then he'll do the high robotic one.
**Fireflies**: Looks like racking is supposed to start on 1031, so as far as schedule goes, you know, we'll be in there, you know, call it mid October, start doing bulk and whatnot.
**Fireflies**: You need to follow up with Jesse with Adelphia, find out if he can crew it or not.
**Gducharme**: You see that?
**Gducharme**: With the Adobe Adelphia, Kevin can give.
**Fireflies**: You his contact info.
**Gducharme**: Got it.
**Gducharme**: Awesome, thank you.
**Jdawson**: Alec was trying to open a link that was in that email I forwarded him today.
**Jdawson**: Is that old information or is that something said the link expired.
**Jdawson**: Some drawings.
**Gducharme**: What link?
**Jdawson**: Emails between you and I and JPC Sam, I believe.
**Jdawson**: So is it.
**Fireflies**: Is there no drawings in the file?
**Gducharme**: Yeah, it was from email from bill key on June 25th.
**Gducharme**: He gave us a link to the system layout drawings and the link just wasn't working for me.
**Fireflies**: Yeah, that's the, that's the background, but those are old.
**Gducharme**: Okay, that's.
**Gducharme**: We're.
**Fireflies**: Wait.
**Fireflies**: Bill is who we're waiting on to give us the current background drawing so that we can build off that.
**Gducharme**: Gotcha.
**Gducharme**: Okay, I can follow up with him.
**Gducharme**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: What is Chris designing off of then?
**Jdawson**: That's a static rack, he said.
**Fireflies**: Well, I don't know.
**Fireflies**: So there's the static rack we've already got.
**Fireflies**: And, and Chris is working on his design.
**Fireflies**: So that should be done.
**Fireflies**: I would think so.
**Fireflies**: Follow up with Chris and see where he's at on that.
**Fireflies**: And then the high robotic system.
**Fireflies**: That's what we're waiting on Bill to give us the backgrounds on.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Kmass**: Okay, perfect.
**Ataylor**: This is AJ Khorndale.
**Ataylor**: He is.
**Kmass**: He's there.
**Kmass**: He's listening.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I'm listening, guys.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So we started on demo last week or two weeks ago.
**Bclymer**: We're going with drywall and framing this week.
**Bclymer**: I hope to have the right away permit settled by end of week.
**Bclymer**: We've been in talks with the building owner's lawyer waiting for him to sign some documents, but that job's rolling along.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Kmass**: Okay, thank you, Aggregate.
**Gducharme**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Avon.
**Bclymer**: Avon.
**Bclymer**: I'm actually.
**Bclymer**: I'm here now walking with jp so we're rolling.
**Bclymer**: They have their go live go, no go tomorrow with Amazon.
**Bclymer**: So just ramping up for all that.
**Ataylor**: Perfect.
**Ataylor**: Thank you.
**Kmass**: Ag.
**Bclymer**: Market demise is me.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: So I sent a final invoice last week.
**Bclymer**: So we had 15 day payment terms.
**Bclymer**: We should be getting a payment here soon.
**Kmass**: Perfect.
**Ataylor**: This is as far as Kissimmee, Nick.
**Kmass**: Sorry.
**Njepson**: We're finishing the job tomorrow and then we need owner payment.
**Fireflies**: Common theme with them.
**Fireflies**: How much?
**Njepson**: I don't remember how much that one was.
**Fireflies**: Maria, you need to look at the numbering because you have GPC.
**Fireflies**: Harrisburg is 119, but it should be 120.
**Ataylor**: So 25, 119 is Goodwill.
**Njepson**: Decatur, that job was 81,000.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Kmass**: Okay, thank you, Nick.
**Ataylor**: Now we have this one.
**Ataylor**: I think this is aj But I think he left.
**Bclymer**: No, I'm still here, guys.
**Ataylor**: Oh, sorry.
**Fireflies**: I'm still here.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So we're finishing Up Change Order 1 this week on the electrical end.
**Bclymer**: I got to get guys out there.
**Bclymer**: Just got the pricing in for added guardrail.
**Bclymer**: So I got to get guys out there this week hopefully and we'll get that knocked out and finished up.
**Jremillard**: Aj we are ready to bill for that, by the way, whenever you want to take a look at that.
**Gducharme**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: I just.
**Bclymer**: I gotta get a PO and.
**Bclymer**: And we'll get that together.
**Bclymer**: So I'm walking with the man himself right now.
**Bclymer**: So I got.
**Bclymer**: I gotta go.
**Bclymer**: I'll follow up with you guys on the estimating stuff.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Fireflies**: Tell him his COO owes me.
**Bclymer**: I. I will, Brandon.
**Kmass**: Thanks.
**Gducharme**: Eventually.
**Fireflies**: Yeah, it's that you'll get paid eventually.
**Fireflies**: Story of my life.
**Ataylor**: Okay, go to estimating aj.
**Jdawson**: So we got a couple more projects.
**Ataylor**: Oh, sorry.
**Kmass**: Go.
**Ataylor**: Which one says.
**Jdawson**: Or just the.
**Jdawson**: So the.
**Jdawson**: The estimate that is.
**Jdawson**: That was like the Brian Andrus homes Is I found out the real the name for it's going to be Roebling Homes.
**Jdawson**: And that's.
**Fireflies**: You should be able to change.
**Fireflies**: That's current I think right?
**Fireflies**: Or do you just move it up?
**Ataylor**: This is when we have to move it up.
**Ataylor**: What is going to be.
**Ataylor**: So this one right?
**Ataylor**: Jesse Andrews five times clear water.
**Ataylor**: That's going to be a new project.
**Jdawson**: 25, 121.
**Kmass**: One second.

**Jdawson**: I gotta pull a permit for the demo and then write a contract and get that to them as well.
**Kmass**: Very slowly.
**Ataylor**: Here.
**Kmass**: One second.
**Kmass**: Okay, There you go.
**Ataylor**: So you say permit.
**Ataylor**: This is here.
**Ataylor**: You said permit and then what did you say?

**Gducharme**: It will be done at the end of the week.
**Jmendez**: Is a quick 10 day job.
**Gducharme**: Eight.
**Jmendez**: Eight day job.
**Jdawson**: We got a PO for that already.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Jmendez**: Andrew gave me a written.
**Jmendez**: He emailed me and said that he would add it to their accounting system or whatever it's called that we bill through Cooper.
**Gducharme**: What?
**Fireflies**: How much is that job?
**Jmendez**: 45,000.
**Jdawson**: Damn.
**Fireflies**: Yes.
**Jmendez**: To answer your question Jesse, yes he did sign our estimate.
**Jdawson**: P.O.
**Fireflies**: Whatever you want to call it.
**Jdawson**: Well he would assign our proposal and then the PO is something they issued to us that we build against.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I.
**Gducharme**: Don'T.
**Gducharme**: I don't have that.
**Gducharme**: I don't have anything back from him.

**Kmass**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Nick.
**Ataylor**: Noblesville Excel Center, Noblesville.
**Gducharme**: We.
**Njepson**: We sent the drawings through Goodwill and they're reviewing it.
**Fireflies**: Did we do the space plane internally?
**Gducharme**: We.
**Njepson**: We had preliminary plans.
**Njepson**: We sent to Abernab and then he made plans.
**Gducharme**: Gotcha.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Fireflies**: DKGR give us a number?
**Njepson**: We told them they're gonna work on it, but we haven't finalized the number, so.
**Jdawson**: Worked.
**Jdawson**: Once we get the Abbottab drawing, we can send them to them.
**Jdawson**: And they should be able to price that for us.
**Jdawson**: Which, when I looked at that he's got.
**Jdawson**: It still isn't right.
**Jdawson**: Nick, we need to go look at that.
**Jdawson**: It doesn't.
**Jdawson**: It's not right.
**Jdawson**: They're not going to like it.
**Fireflies**: So, Christian.
**Fireflies**: I don't know if.
**Fireflies**: Did you reach out to Christian about.
**Fireflies**: I mean, he's done the other ones.
**Fireflies**: Like he's pretty good at him.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we should have went to Christian on that one.
**Fireflies**: Yeah, he's already done the past two cell.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: This is easy.
**Ataylor**: If I'm wrong.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: Alta be refreshing.
**Fireflies**: I'll text Walter right now, but I mean, I keep hitting him up.
**Fireflies**: Let me see if he's messaged me on teams.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Sample of his building.
**Jdawson**: Jesse, I haven't heard anything.
**Jdawson**: Brandon.
**Jdawson**: They said they were waiting if they could clo if they close on the property, they would get back to us, so.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: This is AG2 Churcher El Repair.
**Ataylor**: Do you know anything random?
**Fireflies**: No.
**Fireflies**: I'll text Drew.
**Ataylor**: Nick, Goodwill storefront modifications.
**Njepson**: Yeah, I'll be sending an updated proposal tomorrow.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Kmass**: Thank you.
**Ataylor**: Nick, this is Jesse Silver Phoenix.
**Jdawson**: That's gone.
**Ataylor**: Gone as in lost or.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Biolab expansion.
**Ataylor**: Jesse.
**Jdawson**: I gotta get some numbers put together on that.
**Jdawson**: So that's something.
**Jdawson**: Jesse, once we're done with this Paradise Aisle stuff, maybe tomorrow we can look at that.
**Jdawson**: You could finish up that proposal.
**Jdawson**: They're supposed to give me an alternate on the storm capture and I can't seem to get that from the contractor.
**Jdawson**: So we'll just have to price it the way they got it drawn.
**Ataylor**: Thank you.
**Kmass**: JC.
**Ataylor**: Wait is our good estimate.
**Ataylor**: Current plan still says July 3rd.
**Ataylor**: You already change it for to what day?
**Jdawson**: By the end of this week.
**Jdawson**: We can get him a budget for that.
**Ataylor**: Did you see.
**Kmass**: We have aj?
**Gducharme**: I don't know.
**Ataylor**: Vermian Rice Building Edition.
**Ataylor**: I don't know about that.
**Fireflies**: We submitted the number, so I'm hitting up.
**Fireflies**: I'll follow up with Mark.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: And the last one, City Bird AJ waiting on west to send information.
**Ataylor**: Followed up today.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: So you guys can have links.
**Jdawson**: So there's a new estimate project, the 440 West North Building.
**Ataylor**: North building?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.

**Fireflies**: What's the due date on that?
**Fireflies**: Jesse.
**Jdawson**: He'D like if he can get it in two weeks, he's fine with that.
**Jdawson**: But if we can get it quicker, it's the gets better.
**Fireflies**: Well, I mean, are we bidding this out against other people or we just give them a budget?
**Jdawson**: Like just a budget, you know, he said the drawings aren't good enough.
**Jdawson**: I mean, they got some details.
**Jdawson**: I'm gonna send it to some subs, you know, that I work with and know, and then just to get their budgets.
**Jdawson**: And then he gave me an idea of where we would need to be.
**Jdawson**: And so once we plug some numbers in there and I'll see if we're close to it, then should be good.
**Fireflies**: Where does he want us to be at?
**Jdawson**: Around 2.
**Jdawson**: 2 million?
**Jdawson**: 2.1, something like that.
**Fireflies**: Can't buy a new house on that.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, well, that doesn't include any of the sprinkler work or anything.
**Jdawson**: It's just the renovations of the interior and putting the new canopy drop offs.
**Jdawson**: So, you know, he said, you know, because he admits that it's over design and it really is.
**Gducharme**: There's.
**Jdawson**: They could do a lot a lot less.
**Jdawson**: And so he's like, we'll just give him a little higher number and then they'll want to ve it and we'll take it down to what we should build.
**Jdawson**: Anyways, he's like.
**Jdawson**: I told Justin Kimmich, he's like, you're over designing this?
**Jdawson**: He won't listen to me because he's like, well, they'll just like ve it and then we'll.
**Jdawson**: He's like, yeah, then you're gonna just charge him to redraw the whole damn thing.
**Fireflies**: Yeah, he better know he ain't doing that on collective right.
**Fireflies**: I'll put my foot up his ass.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.

**Bclymer**: And I was like, yeah, I really want to go, because I want to bust his balls about this Stonegate job.
**Fireflies**: So is that what happens when you have a kid?
