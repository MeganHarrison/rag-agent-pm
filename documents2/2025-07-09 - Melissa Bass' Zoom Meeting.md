## Transcript
**Crusin**: Okay, so I guess we can get started.
**Kmass**: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
**Kmass**: I think we're just missing one.
**Crusin**: Just Kello.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Kmass**: I think he's in another meeting right now.
**Kmass**: Okay, well, hi everyone.
**Kmass**: My name's Melissa and I'm one of the account managers here with Plan Hub.
**Kmass**: So I'm going to be your point of contact from here on out.
**Kmass**: And Jesse, what are we want to accomplish today as far as Plan Hub and what kind of goals are you.
**Jdawson**: Guys looking for and what do you want to.
**Crusin**: I would just like to show that if you could show all.
**Crusin**: Everyone like how does it work, some of the functions and you know, just some of the high points of how to load the plans and share the plans.
**Kmass**: And so mainly right now you guys are just an essential plan.
**Kmass**: Correct.
**Kmass**: You're not like a paying member, Is that right?
**Crusin**: Well, we had a.
**Crusin**: We had a trial practice run of the.
**Crusin**: I don't know if it's the first.
**Kmass**: Oh, the Pro member chip.
**Crusin**: Yeah, I think it's like the first upgrade, not like the full package, but like middle.
**Kmass**: Yes, that's right.
**Kmass**: So basically it's a little bit more than the.
**Kmass**: The Pro account.
**Kmass**: You're.
**Kmass**: You have access to the private plan room, and with the central plan, which you're on, you don't.
**Jdawson**: So that's mainly the only difference.
**Kmass**: And then the directory you have, you.
**Jdawson**: Can utilize the directory a little bit more.
**Jdawson**: And with the essential plan, you're kind of limited to that.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Kmass**: So other than that.
**Kmass**: So do you guys have a project that we can post together today?
**Crusin**: I don't have any ones we want to post.
**Crusin**: Like, the one we.
**Crusin**: We did do is the Arizona Goodyear one.
**Crusin**: That's okay.
**Crusin**: The one we.
**Kmass**: Let me share my screen.
**Acannon**: Is this estimating?
**Crusin**: Yes.
**Kmass**: Okay, right now I'm just going to show you how to post the project.
**Kmass**: So let me just share my screen.
**Kmass**: All right, can everybody see my screen here?
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Kmass**: All right, so I'm just going to log in under you, Jesse.
**Kmass**: Hang on.
**Kmass**: I'm going to admit.
**Kmass**: There we go.
**Kmass**: There was one more that I just omitted.
**Kmass**: Was it Kevin?
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Kmass**: All right, so once you.
**Kmass**: Once you log into the account right here, into your account, this is what you're going to see.
**Kmass**: And it looks like you've guys have posted this one right here.
**Jremillard**: Yep.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Kmass**: So we could just go over this one, I guess real quick.
**Crusin**: Yeah, that, that'll work.
**Kmass**: Let's open that one up.
**Kmass**: So right here, when you post a project, you're just going to have like four basic steps right here to Posting a project.
**Kmass**: Once you have a project that you'd like to find subs for, posting the project is one of the best ways.
**Jdawson**: To reach out to subs in mass.
**Kmass**: Right.
**Kmass**: And basically how it works is you put all your information into Plan Hub and then we'll invite subs based on.
**Jdawson**: The trades and the regions of the location of the project, if that makes sense.
**Kmass**: And so what it is is you just have four basic steps here.
**Kmass**: So you're going to put the project.
**Kmass**: Go ahead.
**Crusin**: So just to let the guys know, like, it's not where you post a job.
**Crusin**: And then we're searching like for the subs in the area you post the job.
**Crusin**: And then Melissa will show you like how to.
**Crusin**: To highlight all the scopes in it.
**Crusin**: Then they automatically send notifications to all these subs that see it.
**Crusin**: And then they, you know, they'll either reach out to us or, or contact us.
**Crusin**: I'll let her go through it.
**Crusin**: But I'm just saying, like, like now we would typically how we used the other, I can't remember the other estimate software we were using, we would go and put the job up and then we would search for subcontractors in that area to do those scopes.
**Crusin**: This is different.
**Crusin**: You don't have to do that.
**Crusin**: That's done for you, basically.
**Kmass**: Yes.
**Kmass**: Correct.
**Kmass**: And yeah, so once you invite and finalize the project that you're posting and you're wanting to find subs for the bids, go directly to your emails.
**Kmass**: So.
**Kmass**: But the first step of the project information is going to be the course, the project name, the construction type, whatever is.
**Kmass**: Y' all mainly do commercials?
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Kmass**: The bid due date, of course you want that in there.
**Kmass**: You want to select the time.
**Kmass**: Why isn't that.
**Kmass**: What was the bid due date on this one?
**Kmass**: I don't want to mess it up.
**Crusin**: It was.
**Crusin**: It's already been passed, so that's fine.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: This.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, this has already bidden.
**Kmass**: And then you want to put the time in here.
**Kmass**: And then of course you want to put your time zone and you guys are in Utah or where.
**Kmass**: Remind me.
**Crusin**: We're in Florida.
**Crusin**: Indianapolis, but Jesse R. Is in Phoenix.
**Crusin**: So that was the time zone for that project.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Kmass**: And then you want to specify the.
**Kmass**: Of course the address, the zip code.
**Kmass**: And once you put in the zip code, it's automatically going to create the state for you.
**Kmass**: But then you'll have this dropdown of.
**Jdawson**: What city aligns with that zip code.
**Jdawson**: So you want to make sure that's accurate.
**Kmass**: And then you always want to Hit save and continue down here at the bottom.
**Kmass**: And then it'll take you to the project detail page, the next step over here.
**Kmass**: And so on this step you have GC and submitting right here.
**Kmass**: Excuse me.
**Kmass**: This lets the subs know that this is a competitive.
**Kmass**: It's competitive on your end and you're not yet awarded.
**Kmass**: If you are awarded the project, then of course you could hit awarded and submitting.
**Jdawson**: That lets the subs know that you've been awarded.
**Kmass**: Then you have the project type.
**Kmass**: Whether you could do multiples here, whether it's new construction or if it's a demo, you could select multiples, whatever the case may be.
**Kmass**: And then we have the project.
**Kmass**: Building is going to be the final project.
**Kmass**: So just select whatever applies to you.
**Kmass**: If it doesn't apply to you, you could hit other.
**Kmass**: We have other right here.
**Kmass**: And then the sector is if you have a government job, of course, then.
**Jdawson**: You could hit what applies to that as well.
**Kmass**: So anything in the red with the red asterisk guides is going to be a required field that you have to fill out.
**Kmass**: The estimating and start date time.
**Kmass**: It's not a requirement, but it's helpful to have.
**Kmass**: So if you do have that, go ahead and fill that in the square footage.
**Kmass**: If you do not have that information, you could put a 1 in it to bypass it.
**Jdawson**: But it is a required field.
**Kmass**: And then everything that you have filled out over here on this side is going to land over here on the prescription project description.
**Kmass**: But you can edit this as you wish if you need to add in here more details for the subs because when they open up their year bids.
**Jdawson**: This is going to be the first thing that they see right here.
**Kmass**: So the more information you have in here, the better.
**Kmass**: Just probably a better bid response if.
**Jdawson**: You have more information in there.
**Kmass**: Trades.
**Kmass**: So we have quick selections here.
**Kmass**: We have new construction with site work and then we have interior fit out.
**Kmass**: I recommend just hitting these and then you could add and take away what.
**Jdawson**: Is necessary, what you need and don't need in here.
**Kmass**: This is a pretty important part of when you're posting a project because this is what it'll go out to ourselves.
**Jdawson**: Based on the trades like I talked about.
**Kmass**: So any questions on this, guys?
**Kmass**: No.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Kmass**: And then once you're done and happy with this, you want to hit apply.
**Crusin**: Hey, is Andrew.
**Crusin**: He said he's waiting to get let in, I think.
**Kmass**: I'm sorry.
**Kmass**: There he is.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Kmass**: Hi, Andrew.
**Kmass**: And then the third step, guys, is going to be the project file.
**Kmass**: And this is where you want to download or upload your documents here.
**Gducharme**: And.
**Kmass**: You could do that by opening up your file explorer right here, clicking on this icon and then drag and drop your files accordingly into each folder.
**Kmass**: So you have your plans here.
**Kmass**: Then you can move over to specs, open that up and drag and drop.
**Jdawson**: Your specs into here.
**Kmass**: And if you have an addendum, any pictures, photos, whatever, any, and then just do it accordingly.
**Jdawson**: It's pretty user friendly.
**Kmass**: Any questions on that?
**Kmass**: No?
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Kmass**: And then of course you always want to hit save and continue.
**Gducharme**: And then.
**Kmass**: Invite and finish is going to be your last step when posting a project.
**Kmass**: So what we have here is we have.
**Kmass**: You could do special instructions right here.
**Kmass**: So anything that you didn't get to say in the first three steps, you could add special instructions here.
**Kmass**: Any team members that you want to invite to get bids will go directly to Yalls emails.
**Kmass**: You could check them off here and.
**Jdawson**: Then they would get bids as well.
**Kmass**: So these I only have right now.
**Kmass**: These team members.
**Kmass**: Is there any team members we need to add on here, Jesse, for this.
**Crusin**: Particular project or is this for all projects?
**Kmass**: I was just wondering in general for later on.
**Crusin**: Later on it will get everyone.
**Crusin**: We don't have everyone even invited it looks like.
**Crusin**: So.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Kmass**: But yeah, they would get bids if you.
**Jdawson**: If you wanted them to as well.
**Kmass**: And then the bid due date reminder is.
**Kmass**: Goes up to three days.
**Kmass**: It just reminds the subs.
**Kmass**: Well our system automatically will send out a bid due date reminder reminding them.
**Jdawson**: About this bid project and when it goes out to bid.
**Jdawson**: So I recommend using that too.
**Kmass**: And then do y' all have a list?
**Kmass**: It looks like you've added some subs in here already.
**Kmass**: So if you want to, you could open this up down here and add through the Excel sheet with emails only drag and drop the emails in here and then those subs that you.
**Kmass**: You use will get invited to the.
**Jdawson**: Projects as well if you use a lot of subs that you already are using.
**Crusin**: So Andrew, if you could work on get.
**Crusin**: Make an Excel file, does it need.
**Crusin**: Is it just their email address or does it have to.
**Kmass**: Yes, emails only.
**Crusin**: Just.
**Kmass**: It's kind of touchy.
**Jdawson**: So yeah, emails only.
**Crusin**: So Andrew, if you can make a composite list of all the subs we use.
**Jremillard**: Yep.
**Crusin**: Jobs normally that will make it easier when we post the job here and we want all our normal subs to look at it too that everyone knows where to grab that file and everyone can keep adding to it as we get more and more subs.
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Kmass**: They do Jesse.
**Kmass**: They have.
**Kmass**: They do have to be registered to get invited, but it's free for them to register and it's just, you know.
**Jdawson**: Two or three questions that they have to ask and then they'll have access to your plans or your projects.
**Acannon**: So once I upload that file with all the subs emails, will they receive that register link or how did they register?
**Crusin**: They'll get email from Plan Hub to register so that they.
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Kmass**: Correct.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Crusin**: Okay.
**Kmass**: And then, then you want to hit invite and finish and then it takes up to about 30 minutes for the.
**Jdawson**: Project to go out to get updated and stuff.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Kmass**: So that's how you post your project, guys.
**Kmass**: So once it's posted and if you ever need, if you're not ready to post it and it's not.
**Jdawson**: It'S not.
**Kmass**: Finalized, it'll live here in your drafts tab.
**Kmass**: And you could always go back and.
**Jdawson**: Edit it and change it and then send it out.
**Kmass**: And then I was going to show you on so it'll live right here in your active projects page.
**Kmass**: To open it, you just click on it.
**Kmass**: Get rid of these computers running a little slow.
**Kmass**: Try that again.
**Kmass**: So okay, so here's the overview of the project, right?
**Kmass**: So this is like it'll show you how many ITBs went out, who is how many viewed the project and how.
**Jdawson**: Many have downloaded the file and then your bids.
**Kmass**: So just to give you an overview of the project once you open it up, then your bids tab, once you click on your bids tab, your bids tabs, all your bids are going to be down here at the bottom and it'll show you the trades, the email name, bid amount, the date, the bid docs.
**Jdawson**: And you could also provide feedback here.
**Kmass**: Thanking them for your for submitting their bids.
**Kmass**: I recommend doing that.
**Kmass**: A lot of GCs don't do that and subs love to hear back from gc.
**Kmass**: So just thanking them for submitting their bids goes a long way.
**Kmass**: And then you could also send the.
**Jdawson**: Action a message right here as well with this action button.
**Kmass**: So the main tool I wanted to show you guys is the activity status tracking tool which is going to be this guy right here.
**Kmass**: So this gives you access to the entire list of subs that have, like we talked about that have either viewed your project or downloaded files.
**Kmass**: And so one of the ways to use this tool is a good follow up tool or good outreach tool to communicate with subs.
**Kmass**: And so you could do, you could set your filters.
**Kmass**: So we're showing right now a little over 4,000 companies for this particular project who have either bid on this, no response or they're not bidding.
**Kmass**: So what you could do is narrow.
**Jdawson**: This down to make it a little bit more manageable.
**Kmass**: So you could go in here and just click on who's viewed your project and downloaded files.
**Kmass**: So that means they're showing some kind of interest in the project.
**Kmass**: And then you could go in here in message.
**Kmass**: So that narrows it down just a little over 200 companies that you could.
**Jdawson**: Go in here and actually.
**Kmass**: Send messages to and connect with.
**Kmass**: And you can do that by selecting the ones you want to send a message to and hit this message button up here.
**Kmass**: And then you could send a message saying, just reminding them maybe the bids are due.
**Kmass**: Hey, just letting you know that you.
**Jdawson**: Know.
**Kmass**: Bid due date is coming up.
**Jdawson**: And are you bidding on this job?
**Njepson**: Right.
**Kmass**: And then you can drag and drop your files, any documents in here as well.
**Kmass**: You could also select all and it messages up to 100 subs at a time.
**Kmass**: Now they don't know it's a group message.
**Jdawson**: It's blind carbon copy, but you do.
**Kmass**: And then what you could do is go up here and like we talked about, hitting this message button right here and then hit sending a message out.
**Jdawson**: To the subs as well.
**Jdawson**: This way.
**Kmass**: You could also filter by trade.
**Kmass**: Let's say if you're just short plumbers, Andrew, and you're needing a plumber.
**Jremillard**: You.
**Kmass**: Could go in here and look up plumbing.
**Kmass**: It's your plumbing.
**Kmass**: Hit apply.
**Kmass**: And then that narrows it down to 23 companies that you could reach out.
**Jdawson**: To, which are your plumbers.
**Jremillard**: Awesome.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Kmass**: And you could also message them individually or do it in group.
**Kmass**: If you're in a hurry, you can.
**Jdawson**: Just hit select all message them and reach out to them.
**Acannon**: And you said even if you have the selected all you send a message, it'll go to them individually.
**Acannon**: They won't all get a group message there.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, they don't know it's a group message.
**Jdawson**: It's blind carbon copied.
**Jremillard**: Perfect.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Kmass**: And then also you could create notes in here as well.
**Kmass**: Guys, let's say if you know, one of you guys have talked to Greg here about this job, you could put a message in here and then all team members know, hey, I've reached out.
**Jdawson**: To this guy and what the status is.
**Kmass**: You could also, Adam, you could also sit here that you've contacted them.
**Kmass**: You could send out pre qualification reminders to them or you could heart them as your favorite.
**Kmass**: Let's see, you could also, you could open up their company profile here.
**Kmass**: Open it up and it tells you a little Bit about their company, their team members, their location and all that, their trades, etc.
**Jdawson**: Let's see, go back.
**Kmass**: Clear that.
**Kmass**: All right, so any questions on the activity status tracking guys on that tool?
**Acannon**: Nope, not for me.
**Acannon**: Looks great.
**Kmass**: No.
**Kmass**: Okay, let's go over on this.
**Crusin**: Also this screen, isn't this where if you have someone else during the project you want to add as a, like a company, we know if it isn't on our spreadsheet, isn't it here where you invite them?
**Kmass**: Oh, that's the directory.
**Kmass**: I'll get to that in a minute.
**Kmass**: Where you could add them in.
**Crusin**: Yeah, add a single one later if you wanted.
**Kmass**: Yeah, the directory.
**Kmass**: And then you could.
**Kmass**: There's two or three options here where you could upload subs as well.
**Kmass**: Let me, I was going to show you this real quick.
**Kmass**: On the post update project, I would recommend utilizing this like say if the bid due dates changed or you have a new addendum or whatever, you could hit this post update button, send your message in here and hit send.
**Jdawson**: And that goes out as well.
**Jdawson**: Just updating them, letting them know that something's changed on the project.
**Kmass**: And then also we have this edit button.
**Kmass**: You could edit your project as well.
**Jdawson**: Right here.
**Kmass**: Let's see on the directory we'll go to the directory.
**Kmass**: Okay, so this tool, the directory, we have like over 300,000 subs nationwide.
**Kmass**: So you can expand your sub base by using this.
**Kmass**: So the good way to do this is on the left hand side.
**Kmass**: Over here you could go to.
**Kmass**: Hang on just a second.
**Kmass**: So this is the plan Hub directory.
**Kmass**: So let me just go over this.
**Kmass**: You could add these guys into your network actually.
**Kmass**: Is this what you're talking about, Jesse?
**Kmass**: Maybe.
**Crusin**: I thought there was a button up there.
**Crusin**: Upload your sub list.
**Crusin**: That was the one.
**Kmass**: Oh yeah.
**Kmass**: Okay, this is another one.
**Kmass**: So you could either like drag and drop your Excel sheet with emails only in here and add your subs, or you can hand.
**Kmass**: You could manually do it and add.
**Jdawson**: Them that way as well.
**Kmass**: Let's see, hang on.
**Kmass**: So on the network directory is where you could reach out and discover new subs.
**Kmass**: So the project specific view is what we're looking at now that I clicked on.
**Kmass**: This means that these subs have interacted with your project and then you have your contacts down here.
**Kmass**: So you have your out of network and your in network.
**Kmass**: So your in network is going to be anybody that you have added by either hitting this button right here or uploading your subs like we talked about.
**Kmass**: So that will be your in Network.
**Jdawson**: Subs in the directory here.
**Kmass**: So this contact, this badge right here, the orange badge means that they're a paying member.
**Kmass**: The blue badge means that they submit multiple bids per month.
**Kmass**: You could also, it gives their contact information here as well, what trades they do.
**Kmass**: You could also narrow it down by zip code and distance on finding subs and then your state as well.
**Kmass**: And then you see, go to Outlook Network.
**Kmass**: Hang on.
**Kmass**: So you're.
**Kmass**: So you're out of Network.
**Kmass**: You have 91 subs here.
**Kmass**: And you could go back, you could go in here, guys, and add them.
**Jdawson**: Into your directory is what I was talking about earlier.
**Jdawson**: And that way they'll get, they'll always get invited to your projects as well.
**Kmass**: And so you could just filter this out by trades right here and play around with it.
**Acannon**: So just by adding them to their, to our network or uploading them, that top right corner, that's to any new project.
**Kmass**: Yeah, they'll get invited to, to your projects.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Kmass**: And sometimes they think, sometimes they think it's going to cost money.
**Jdawson**: I get this sometimes where the GCs will be like they're, they won't register.
**Kmass**: Because they're thinking it's going to cost.
**Jdawson**: Money or whatever, but it doesn't.
**Jdawson**: So it's always free for them to access that.
**Jdawson**: So just you may need to remind them of that.
**Kmass**: But on this right here, you could also email up to 50 at a time as well on this one.
**Gducharme**: And.
**Jdawson**: Send out a message as well on that one too.
**Kmass**: So any questions on the directory, guys?
**Acannon**: So if they automatically get access or I'm assuming they get some sort of notification when there's new project and say, I have something in Arizona, but they're based out of New York that really won't relate to them.
**Acannon**: Is that still going to them or how does that kind of look if.
**Kmass**: You add them into the directory and you wanted them to get invited?
**Kmass**: Yes.
**Acannon**: Okay, so it's okay.
**Acannon**: Job specific directory.
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Acannon**: Yeah, makes sense.
**Kmass**: So, yeah, let's see.
**Kmass**: Yeah, here's all their contact information.
**Kmass**: So, yeah, let's see on.
**Kmass**: Do y' all need information on takeoff and estimation?
**Kmass**: Jesse?
**Crusin**: I don't think so.
**Crusin**: I think like one thing that as far as estimating, like putting together numbers or anything like that, is the bid leveler.
**Crusin**: Is there anything on your site that actually makes an estimate or it's simply a platform to reach out to them and they send a surprise.
**Kmass**: Yeah, hang on, let me get my notes here.
**Kmass**: Yeah, so the bid level, it's going to basically organize by division.
**Kmass**: So you can compare apples to apples once you get your bids back.
**Kmass**: Yeah.
**Kmass**: So this is just kind of a breakdown of shows the trades right here and then the bids compared apples to apples.
**Kmass**: You can request breakdowns right here on the.
**Kmass**: In order to do a proposal that's an upgrade, Jesse.
**Kmass**: So it's kind of limited on this.
**Jdawson**: But it does let you compare side to side here.
**Crusin**: Yeah, well, we have our own proposal template.
**Crusin**: We would have to fill it out, but that'd be good.
**Crusin**: At least it groups them all together for each division, so that's good, right?
**Kmass**: So, yeah.
**Kmass**: And then you.
**Kmass**: All their contacts information down here, you can message, download, hide.
**Kmass**: If you didn't like this bid or like it.
**Kmass**: Yeah, I think you could.
**Kmass**: Yeah.
**Kmass**: On this one, I think you can request the breakdown of the bid as well.
**Kmass**: On the essential plan.
**Kmass**: I think you just can't do the proposal.
**Jdawson**: Right here.
**Jdawson**: This is an upgrade.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Kmass**: I could send a video on this, on a tutorial on how to do this as well.
**Kmass**: But this is something kind of our specialist cover.
**Kmass**: So if you want to.
**Kmass**: If you need a webinar or I can send you a link on the.
**Jdawson**: Takeoff estimation as well.
**Jdawson**: If you needed that information.
**Acannon**: Yeah, if you send me those, I'll take a look.
**Kmass**: Yeah, I could do that for you guys.
**Kmass**: But other than that, that's pretty much it.
**Kmass**: The settings.
**Kmass**: Let's see.
**Kmass**: I recommend adding your logo in here.
**Kmass**: Do we have a logo that we could add in here for you guys?
**Kmass**: It just makes it look more professional.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Kmass**: But I would upload your logo in here and then you could toggle any of these on and off if you don't want them to apply to you on settings.
**Kmass**: All this is accurate.
**Kmass**: I was going to share with you the shareable project page right here.
**Kmass**: So you could copy this and paste this to any browser.
**Kmass**: And then anything that's actively bidding on Plan Hub, that is your project, will open up.
**Kmass**: So it's kind of like your own.
**Jdawson**: Plan room with this right here.
**Kmass**: So you could share this link.
**Kmass**: You could also put it like in your signature line or on your website.
**Kmass**: So I'd recommend using that.
**Kmass**: It's good to have.
**Kmass**: And then if you want to invite team members, I think it looks like you've already done this, Jesse.
**Kmass**: You can just hit invite and they'll get an invitation as well.
**Jdawson**: And.
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Kmass**: Yeah.
**Kmass**: Any questions on this area?
**Kmass**: Yeah.

**Kmass**: Or if you're short.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Kmass**: Just let me know.
