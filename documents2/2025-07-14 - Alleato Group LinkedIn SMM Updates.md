**Victoria**: Andrea.
**Victoria**: Hi, Annika.
**Ataylor**: How are you?
**Bclymer**: Good.
**Ataylor**: How are you?

**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Victoria**: Yeah, it's been a nice weekend.
**Victoria**: Good weather over here?
**Ataylor**: No, that's good.
**Victoria**: Yeah.
**Victoria**: Yes.
**Victoria**: And how has your I think two weeks been?
**Victoria**: I think it's been two weeks since we really sidetracked it.
**Ataylor**: Two weeks?
**Ataylor**: You said two weeks.
**Victoria**: I think it's been two weeks since we saw each other.
**Victoria**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: Oh, yeah, you're right.
**Ataylor**: How was your travel?
**Victoria**: Right?
**Ataylor**: You were traveling?
**Victoria**: Yes.
**Victoria**: Yeah, I went to California and travel.
**Ataylor**: Oh, nice.
**Ataylor**: That's good.
**Victoria**: Yes.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: Let me see.
**Ataylor**: Once again, Brandon joins because we need him and he has another meeting, but he doesn't have to be in that.
**Victoria**: One so I'm gonna force him to join mine.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, I have bad news for the day in the life.
**Ataylor**: Like they keep pushing and pushing and pushing and I'm like, guys.
**Victoria**: Yeah, so I get it.
**Ataylor**: I mean it's sometimes and for example, Andrew is like, I'm recording one clip and then another thing happened.
**Ataylor**: And then another thing happened.
**Ataylor**: I'm gonna keep pushing them all the time.
**Ataylor**: Like I'm gonna tell them right now.
**Ataylor**: One second.
**Ataylor**: Now that I have you here, let me tell them.
**Ataylor**: Where is Andrew here?
**Victoria**: Yeah, we can come up with some, some other ideas because I think that maybe if a day in the life is too much for them to film, it's something they can film in 10 minutes.
**Victoria**: You know, that's going to be one thing that they can be done with that's gonna maybe be better.
**Ataylor**: Alex, actually, Alex like to do that.
**Ataylor**: You know, he's kind of like.
**Ataylor**: But I don't know why.
**Ataylor**: Let me see.
**Ataylor**: Was it the one.
**Ataylor**: It was.
**Ataylor**: I forgot his name.
**Ataylor**: Yep.
**Victoria**: Well, this is actually going to be a pretty short call today because you just have a couple things for us to go over together and then.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Victoria**: Because really, like we need to.
**Victoria**: And I'll say this to Brandon, but there's just reminders for the videos that we want to do.
**Ataylor**: Oh my God.
**Victoria**: Yeah.
**Victoria**: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Victoria**: Not a problem there because there's some time because I'll.
**Victoria**: We'll look at the content calendar too.
**Victoria**: And then there's two other posts this month that we just need.
**Victoria**: Like I sent them in the email for today's call agenda, but it's just like a couple bullet points that I need some information on in order to finish up the posts.
**Ataylor**: You straight to uncle.
**Bclymer**: Was it.
**Ataylor**: Was.
**Ataylor**: He said it was 245.
**Ataylor**: No.
**Victoria**: I think it's okay if he actually can't join it should be fine.
**Ataylor**: No, but he said I just joined and it said it was 245.
**Victoria**: No, it's definitely two.
**Victoria**: Oh, here he is.
**Victoria**: Hi, Brandon.
**Bclymer**: Hey.
**Victoria**: How you doing?
**Jdawson**: Good, how are you?
**Ataylor**: Good, good.
**Victoria**: This is just going to be a quick call.
**Victoria**: We have a couple things to go over.
**Victoria**: So there's just a reminder to film that internal Q A.
**Victoria**: And I can for reforword that those prompts to both of you if you need them.
**Victoria**: But I know you guys are setting that up and.
**Victoria**: And then Maria was saying how the Day in the Life videos are not going well with the, with the team because it takes too long for them to create them and they have to do other things, their actual job.
**Victoria**: Right.
**Victoria**: So I'm thinking maybe when you give them some prompts that it'll take them like 10 minutes, 15 minutes to create one go rather than having them have to come back.
**Jdawson**: Got to keep it simple.
**Victoria**: Right?
**Victoria**: Okay.
**Victoria**: So yeah, we'll come up with some different ideas there.
**Victoria**: And then there's a couple prompt questions I need from you.
**Victoria**: Just some bullet point information on the beam electrical feature and then this problem solve feature which I sent me now, which we can go over together if you have ideas on that.
**Victoria**: I just need a little bit of information from you so that I can finish up those posts.
**Victoria**: And those are.
**Victoria**: I'll copy and paste that into together.
**Victoria**: So for Dean Electrical, what projects have they worked on recently?
**Victoria**: What, you know, why.
**Victoria**: Why do you work with them?
**Victoria**: Why do they stand out?
**Victoria**: Any specific stories?
**Victoria**: The first two are the most important but specific stories or challenges and anything else you want to add.
**Jdawson**: So I would say, I would say the jobs are working on now is Westfield Collective, Radial, Avon, Goodwill, Bart.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I think that's it.
**Jdawson**: You know, I'd say one.
**Jdawson**: One that was.
**Jdawson**: That they delivered on really well was the Goodwill Southeast Excel Center.
**Jdawson**: You know, we had a very, you know, tough time with the landlord, which was IPS Schools.
**Jdawson**: Basically we had an approved design and a week into it, they decided to completely change everything and the requirements.
**Jdawson**: And it was a moving target the entire time.
**Jdawson**: And Dean did a really great job about, you know, going with the flow and working through the bumps and bruises and still keeping the schedule so that we could get them open for school to start in August.
**Victoria**: Okay.
**Victoria**: So my guess is that you wouldn't want to bad mouth the school.
**Jdawson**: This is state of Georgia.
**Jdawson**: Hold on.
**Jdawson**: This is Brandon I.
**Bclymer**: It.
**Victoria**: Oh, you're on mute if you're talking.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, so this is super important for the Georgia.
**Ataylor**: So.
**Ataylor**: So you were saying for Dean.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Was your collection and then what was the other one?
**Victoria**: So what made their team stand out?
**Victoria**: So, I mean, this, this in itself is a great place to go off of.
**Victoria**: They were, you know, move, go with the flow.
**Victoria**: And I would just not say that the school was difficult.
**Victoria**: You know, I won't mention those particular changes and.
**Victoria**: Exactly.
**Victoria**: So yeah, that's enough for this.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, you remind me.
**Ataylor**: Sorry.
**Ataylor**: For Westfield Collective, we have a topping ceremony.
**Ataylor**: You know, the topping up ceremony when they put like the laws.
**Ataylor**: So we're having it on July 25, so maybe we can as well.
**Ataylor**: And we just have this one.
**Ataylor**: And then Jesse has a lot of suggestions for the newsletter too.
**Ataylor**: So I'll tell you right now.
**Ataylor**: So he said, one second, I have it saved.
**Ataylor**: Where he says, he said newsletter comments.
**Ataylor**: He said that it should probably be a quarterly newsletter with spotlighting team members.
**Ataylor**: He said we should talk about potential projects instead of the projects we're just working on.
**Ataylor**: For example, like, I don't know, we're just working or maybe working to get the California license, you know, something like that.
**Ataylor**: So our little group is working on getting California license.
**Ataylor**: We're going to get close to your state that.
**Ataylor**: So to get.
**Ataylor**: To get.
**Ataylor**: I'll ask.
**Ataylor**: Okay, I'll check anyway.
**Ataylor**: So yeah, that was his comment.
**Ataylor**: So for spotlighting team members, potential projects, what are they going to be?
**Ataylor**: When is it going to be?
**Ataylor**: For example, if we're doing licensing or like we're working on these and that.
**Ataylor**: And then he said, change the last paragraph of the newsletter.
**Ataylor**: He said, change it because I remember why.
**Victoria**: One second.
**Ataylor**: So I have the newsletter here, here.
**Ataylor**: So the last paragraph is.
**Ataylor**: We're glad you are part of the Alito community.
**Ataylor**: Here is to study progress, lasting impact and jobs done.
**Ataylor**: Right.
**Ataylor**: Catch your next.
**Ataylor**: Catch you next month.
**Ataylor**: Brandon and the little team.
**Ataylor**: So he said it was okay, but he felt that it was more like we were like rewarding.
**Ataylor**: Submit a ticket on my other phone because your application.
**Bclymer**: Oh, jeez.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, I know.
**Ataylor**: That's the problem.
**Ataylor**: Anyway, so.
**Ataylor**: So he said instead of saying like welcome, oh, thank you for being part of the Al family, maybe we just mention it.
**Ataylor**: Like he was saying like that, that if we continue to something else maybe like.
**Ataylor**: And remember you are your partner from the ground up or you know, something like that.
**Ataylor**: Instead of talking, telling them part of the Al community.
**Ataylor**: And yeah, that's one thing.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: And the other thing he said was.
**Ataylor**: The other thing was he said where are we going?
**Ataylor**: The price of project.
**Ataylor**: So he said that we can actually talk numbers like working okay.
**Ataylor**: Five million, you know, projects.
**Ataylor**: So Alito is growing, you know, with these.
**Ataylor**: So we have to give you more numbers so you can have, you know, like until.
**Ataylor**: About numbers.
**Ataylor**: Like, for example, working on a 5 million project.
**Ataylor**: Awesome.
**Ataylor**: That's just good because he said that when we talk numbers and we gave those type of projects, it makes us stand out for our clients.
**Ataylor**: Like, wow, they're growing, they're working on this.
**Ataylor**: That's good.
**Ataylor**: And then the last one.
**Ataylor**: Oh, yeah.
**Ataylor**: Every time we have something, call it to we are hiring.
**Ataylor**: Let them know, like, we are hiring PM superintendents, things like that.
**Ataylor**: So maybe the clients know something or somebody and contact us.
**Ataylor**: Replacement.
**Ataylor**: Replacement for what?
**Ataylor**: Contact us in the local social media, copyright, mail and addresses, blah, blah.
**Ataylor**: Oh, yeah, if you can do the mailing address as well for Florida.
**Ataylor**: Like if we can have two addresses.
**Ataylor**: And then that's it.
**Ataylor**: That's what he said.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Those were his comments.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: It doesn't have to be like, only if you feel like it's not.
**Ataylor**: But he was just like, I think this will be a great idea, a good idea.
**Ataylor**: I agree with the projects that we're working on and maybe with the ones that future and the prize money, we.
**Victoria**: Can show some of them.
**Ataylor**: Exactly.
**Ataylor**: I think it's not even a million, but that's what he was saying.
**Ataylor**: Like numbers brought up like a lot of clients.
**Ataylor**: You know, when we send numbers, like working on these projects.
**Ataylor**: So we have to give you more details on that.
**Victoria**: Yeah, I think that sounds wonderful.
**Victoria**: I have a question about the we are hiring aspect.
**Victoria**: Are you currently hiring for new positions and what would this be?
**Victoria**: And also, do you have links to Indeed or wherever you are hosting them?
**Ataylor**: No.
**Ataylor**: So usually we have.
**Ataylor**: We send it to our website.
**Ataylor**: So we have in the career section, there's something that says work with us and then you can see the jobs that we have open.
**Ataylor**: But right now let me confirm because I think I'll confirm before we do something for the newsletter.
**Bclymer**: What.
**Ataylor**: Which ones do we need?
**Ataylor**: But I'll let you know.
**Ataylor**: I mean, it doesn't have to be every time, but to let you know.
**Ataylor**: And yeah, I don't know if you're.
**Ataylor**: Brandon says, for example, five.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: We have a 40 million hotel in Savannah.
**Bclymer**: Exactly.
**Ataylor**: And then we have a 1, 2 billion project for Meijer.
**Ataylor**: So that's what Jesse was saying.
**Ataylor**: Let's put our numbers because that bring our reputation super high.
**Ataylor**: And I agree with him.
**Ataylor**: I think we should definitely bring up numbers.
**Victoria**: Perfect.
**Victoria**: All right.
**Victoria**: Yeah, I can absolutely put those numbers in there.
**Victoria**: So I will Ask specifically.
**Victoria**: I'll send a follow up email with the exact details.
**Ataylor**: Don't forget about the topping of ceremony for Westfield Collective as well.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, and I'll find out a new, better new media person.
**Ataylor**: I'll check with the city.
**Ataylor**: Brandon.
**Ataylor**: Okay, that's good.
**Ataylor**: From our site.
**Ataylor**: What else, Annika?
**Victoria**: Okay, the post about.
**Victoria**: Yeah, no problem.
**Victoria**: We got enough for electrical and then we need something for the problem solved spotlight.
**Victoria**: So just a very specific example of a problem that was run into on a job and then how the team solved.
**Victoria**: But just.
**Victoria**: Sorry.
**Victoria**: A, B, C.
**Ataylor**: Okay, we can ask the team.
**Ataylor**: I don't know if Brendan has something in mind actually.
**Ataylor**: He run actually in a recent problem with.
**Ataylor**: I don't remember where he went there.
**Ataylor**: He fixed it at noon.
**Ataylor**: He promised he'll fix it at noon.
**Ataylor**: He fixed it and that's what the team.
**Ataylor**: You know, so we can talk about it maybe timeline time wise, you know, like he was flying the problem, you know, and he did it and they fixed it and they.
**Ataylor**: So but he has to let you know exactly what project was because I don't remember.
**Jdawson**: Oh, you're talking about.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, yeah, you flew there and then you fix it.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, well, yeah, okay.
**Victoria**: Yes, that would work great.
**Victoria**: And if.
**Victoria**: Even if you have a couple, I.
**Jdawson**: Don'T know if we want to highlight because it was our team's fault.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, that's good.
**Ataylor**: Learning from them.
**Victoria**: Yeah, we can spin it.
**Victoria**: Yeah, that's true.
**Victoria**: And see how vague we can be with it while it's still being interesting.
**Victoria**: Okay, so that sounds.
**Victoria**: Sounds great.
**Victoria**: I have right here just a note for the Bigwell Bart testimony for the case study because we haven't heard exactly from them yet.
**Victoria**: So it's just on that on the back burner.
**Victoria**: So let me know if you hear something else from them and then.
**Victoria**: Yes, I think that's it should be everything.
**Victoria**: We can hop into the calendar real quick so you can have a visual of it.
**Victoria**: We'll replace the Day in the Life video with maybe the Problem Solve Spotlight or something or yeah, the Problem Solve Spotlight or the Trade Partner Spotlight this week, whatever we can get done first.
**Victoria**: And then we'll work on replacing these videos with content that they can film more easily.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: And whenever I have availability and like Andrew is telling me I'm working on it right now, Jack too.
**Ataylor**: So if I have them, I'll send them your way right away so we can post something.
**Bclymer**: Okay, absolutely.
**Victoria**: Yeah, I think that sounds great.
**Victoria**: Even if it's, you know, we film something else in the meantime and it Gets there eventually it's good.
**Victoria**: And then our next meeting would be two weeks from today.
**Victoria**: And then we would go over the August calendar.
