## Transcript
**Jdawson**: Morning, everybody.
**Nbigler**: Morning.
**Awoodhams**: Morning.
**Gdesmit**: Emailed from Jerrica saying she's out of town.
**Gdesmit**: Not going to be on this.
**Gdesmit**: Say again.
**Gdesmit**: We had some stuff to discuss with her, but.
**Gdesmit**: Hey, Jeff, were you able to shoot me over those color selections when you get a chance?
**Gdesmit**: Just a reminder from the four.
**Gdesmit**: Was it the four metal colors or.
**Gdesmit**: Jeff, can you hear me?
**Gdesmit**: I'm talking to him.
**Jdawson**: He's trying to get his headset set up.
**Ashton**: No, it's fine.
**Ashton**: I could hear the whole time.
**Ashton**: Oh, just.
**Gdesmit**: Just selection a light hearing.
**Jdawson**: That's all right, Jeff.
**Gdesmit**: I was asking.
**Gdesmit**: I was trying to remind you to see if you could shoot me over those colors that you're going to email me from the meeting yesterday.
**Gdesmit**: The metal colors?
**Ashton**: Yeah, I have them all in an email that answers all of Nick's questions.
**Ashton**: So as long as we get through this meeting and nothing changes, I'll send.
**Jdawson**: It out to everybody afterwards.
**Gdesmit**: Okay.
**Brhoades**: Thank you.
**Gdesmit**: You took those metal samples back with you, didn't you?
**Jdawson**: I did.
**Ashton**: Correct.
**Brhoades**: Consider them a birthday present for me.
**Ashton**: I don't know how many VP sample rings we have floating around the office, but we have another building we're doing with VP right now in Allentown, Pennsylvania, so these will actually come in handy.
**Brhoades**: Ah, with laugh, huh?
**Ashton**: Yeah.
**Brhoades**: Small world.
**Ashton**: Are you working with Walt, too?
**Brhoades**: We did the Republic here in Indianapolis.
**Brhoades**: He asked us to go to Allentown, and we said, sorry, too busy working for a lido group in Westfield.
**Ashton**: So in hindsight, between you, me, and the lamppost, we probably should have said the same thing.
**Brhoades**: Dude, those buildings are complicated.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Ashton**: I mean, when they have to ship the entirety of the conveyor system from Europe, you gotta have a lot of stuff way out in front of the horse.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Ashton**: Those buildings over off a Hannah should be almost done, though, right?
**Brhoades**: Yeah, we've been done for a while.
**Brhoades**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Brhoades**: It's nice jobs.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Gdesmit**: Micah also is not able to come today.
**Gdesmit**: He has a couple things that he emailed me that I put in the agenda after I sent the agenda out, but we'll cover those.
**Gdesmit**: I think Brandon's finishing up a call, but we can probably go ahead and get started.
**Gdesmit**: This agenda up.
**Brhoades**: Okay.
**Gdesmit**: First thing up is our stair pans and railings.
**Gdesmit**: Just real quick, Nick, how.
**Gdesmit**: How are we coming along with your design on the stairs and railings?
**Brhoades**: I'm hoping to get a price and a scopes put together by next week from one of our suppliers that we've been working with on some projects.
**Brhoades**: So I'll let you know when they get me a firm day on the pricing.
**Brhoades**: Yeah, I think that's about where it's at right now.
**Gdesmit**: The 19k is just an internal thing to make sure.
**Gdesmit**: I don't remember in the design meeting yesterday we did discuss the floor mounted.
**Gdesmit**: Well, the railings that essentially go around.
**Gdesmit**: Nope, I put that somewhere else.
**Gdesmit**: But the railings that go around the mezzanine will do kind of vertical baluster infill instead of horizontal.
**Gdesmit**: Going between airplane wire and some other decisions.
**Gdesmit**: They're worried about climbing over that.
**Gdesmit**: So if you're designing those rails.
**Gdesmit**: Vertical.
**Gdesmit**: Vertical baluster infill for the rails around the opening of the mezzanine.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Brhoades**: So we are not mounting to the exterior perimeter angle anymore.
**Gdesmit**: No, it has nothing about mounting.
**Gdesmit**: It's just the infill instead of having horizontal rails, which is kind of what's shown.
**Gdesmit**: Well, I guess you probably don't have that.
**Gdesmit**: Jeff.
**Gdesmit**: Jeff had it in his.
**Ashton**: Yeah, they want to do vertical pickets instead of horizontal or aircraft cable because they're afraid of small kids climbing over and jumping to their death.
**Brhoades**: I get it.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Ashton**: So we'll update, we'll update that within our family, but it'll be a simplified railing profile.
**Ashton**: We'll just do a bottom and a top main rail and then vertical pickets every four inches.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Brhoades**: Are you.
**Brhoades**: When do you think you'll be able to send that out?
**Ashton**: I mean, we can send you a sketch of it, but I mean, we have to detail everything.
**Ashton**: I mean, I don't know if we can get it to you in advance of the four date.
**Ashton**: We could probably just do a quick sketch of what like a typical four or six foot section might look like.
**Ashton**: But you're not going to get the full details until we send out the full set.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Gdesmit**: Okay.
**Brhoades**: Well, if that's the case.
**Brhoades**: So are we going to do.
**Brhoades**: We need to do that specific big perimeter angle then that Jerrica.
**Brhoades**: Okay, we are still going to do that.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Ashton**: And with that, one of my questions was.
**Ashton**: So we had talked about what that size was going to be and we needed to confirm what is the total from top of joist right to the top of the concrete.
**Jdawson**: Is it.
**Ashton**: Is it a total pour of four inches with the deck?
**Ashton**: Is it four and a half?
**Ashton**: What's that total thickness?
**Brhoades**: It's four.
**Gdesmit**: Yeah.
**Brhoades**: I think the top of joist information that I gave to Jericho while ago, I thought it said 11 foot 8 because at the time that was when it was a 12 foot finished floor height.
**Brhoades**: So I would say just add, you know, the six inches to everything.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Ashton**: So if if we do a 4 inch.
**Ashton**: So if, if it's 4 inches from where that angle is going to start to the top of the concrete, we're going to recommend a 6 inch tall angle to give a 2 inch lip.
**Jdawson**: At the, at the edge.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Brhoades**: And then the other direction doesn't really matter.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Ashton**: Anywhere where we don't have a rail, it can just be a pour stop that matches the depth of the floor.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Brhoades**: So probably Varco's galvanized standard perimeter angle.
**Brhoades**: Everywhere else is fine.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Brhoades**: That answers that.
**Brhoades**: Thank you.
**Gdesmit**: Cool.
**Gdesmit**: Second part, architectural design.
**Gdesmit**: This one is mostly based on Nick's email.
**Gdesmit**: If we want to go through these.
**Gdesmit**: I know, Jeff, you said you had a answers for these or you can email out.
**Gdesmit**: Do you have all the answers for, for all eight of these or.
**Gdesmit**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: Real quick.
**Ashton**: Yeah, so I'll just start at the top if we want to start there.
**Ashton**: Yeah.
**Ashton**: So Jericho and I worked through cost or, I'm sorry, weight for those parapet areas.
**Ashton**: We came up to be conservative.
**Ashton**: About 200 pounds per lineal foot.
**Ashton**: They're roughly 12ft high from the actual main roof line.
**Ashton**: So there's 96 linear feet for each of the parapets.
**Ashton**: So that works out.
**Ashton**: Total weight.
**Ashton**: Right.
**Ashton**: For all four sides is a little under 20,000.
**Ashton**: So it's 19 two is the, is the math.
**Ashton**: But we were just estimating 200 pounds per lineal foot.
**Gdesmit**: Is 19 two each or each.
**Ashton**: Correct.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, each.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Ashton**: So 19,200 pounds for each total parapet.
**Ashton**: That includes framing, the EFIs, miscellaneous weight for the roof, etc.
**Ashton**: Number two.
**Ashton**: Yeah, agreed.
**Ashton**: We're gonna show everything at ten foot.
**Ashton**: And then if we, with the increased height of the mezzanine, and then if for some reason we run into it once we get through the actual.
**Ashton**: Once we have all the final steel, Nick, we can look at lowering them slightly depending on the exact.
**Ashton**: It's.
**Ashton**: I mean, you know, again, it's things that haven't been, you know, proved out.
**Ashton**: Right.
**Ashton**: We need the steel.
**Ashton**: We need, you know, the exact, you know, which whichever door you guys are actually going to buy out.
**Ashton**: So we can check the actual clearance heights of it.
**Ashton**: But I think like we said, because all the weight is bearing on the jambs, it's way easier to adjust that top piece up and down slightly to fit that opening.
**Ashton**: So as long as we go large now and say it's 10ft, you know, if it becomes a little smaller, we'll just have to work on that.
**Brhoades**: I agree.
**Brhoades**: I think that's wise.
**Ashton**: Okay, let's see.
**Ashton**: Number Three.
**Ashton**: Yeah.
**Ashton**: So those concessions are not six foot tall.
**Ashton**: I think that was just a typo in the initial one.
**Ashton**: They're 3 foot 6.
**Ashton**: So we'll have the final opening heights with the new exhibit that we're putting together that I'll get to here at the end of the day.
**Ashton**: We've been going through and tidying up the elevation so we have everything at the right sole and head heights and all that.
**Ashton**: So.
**Brhoades**: Perfect.
**Ashton**: Number four, agree.
**Ashton**: We will do whatever tiebacks we need to a girt.
**Ashton**: And then they'll be lightweight aluminum canopies, so we'll show additional blocking as required.
**Brhoades**: Sounds good.
**Ashton**: Number five.
**Ashton**: So I do have that.
**Ashton**: As long as we all agree on how we're going to frame it.
**Ashton**: I'm going to share real quick, if you don't mind, and steal real quick.
**Ashton**: So this is the elevator that you guys specified.
**Ashton**: And what we are essentially showing is six inch metal studs on or.
**Ashton**: Yeah, six inch metal studs on all four sides.
**Ashton**: This opening that you see here, so this five foot seven and a quarter by six foot seven and a quarter is essentially the width of the requested clear plus the 5, 8 for all the jip.
**Ashton**: What we'd prefer to do is just frame to the bottom of the deck and the top of the deck and just run the drywall clear past the edge of the opening.
**Ashton**: And then you'll have to provide wood blocking on this side of the elevator shaft for the main rails.
**Ashton**: So as long as we are all in agreement on how we're framing that, then this is the dimension.
**Ashton**: If you want to take the studs floor to roof, then this then obviously comes out, you know, here on all four sides.
**Ashton**: But this is how we would propose that we frame it.
**Jfield**: Yeah, that's fine.
**Jfield**: Stop and start at each level.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Ashton**: So I'll put these dimensions in there.
**Ashton**: And what I'll do, Nick, is I'll export out a new base so that you can also see.
**Ashton**: The only part that's kind of weird is this dimension right here.
**Ashton**: I'm assuming you guys don't want to half dimensions basically from the back of this girt to where this is this little six inch piece.
**Ashton**: I'm assuming you would rather not have a 6 inch piece of slab back here on the back side of this.
**Ashton**: So my thought is, is that we include the opening essentially like this.
**Ashton**: That that is the final opening.
**Ashton**: So it just goes up to the girt.
**Ashton**: So we don't have to run a little piece of slab in the back because that would be awkward.
**Ashton**: So if that's good.
**Ashton**: Then that way it's just framed on three sides, and it's up against a girt.
**Ashton**: And then we'll send you a new CAD base that has this specifically in a.
**Brhoades**: All right, thank you.
**Brhoades**: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense to me.
**Ashton**: All right.
**Gdesmit**: Cool.
**Gdesmit**: Number six was the downspout and corner colors.
**Gdesmit**: We got metal selection colors yesterday.
**Gdesmit**: I did not.
**Ashton**: Yeah, so for the downspouts, I mean, I'm assuming you don't want to change colors halfway down.
**Brhoades**: Well, Jeff, we are the best in the business, and we've done that before, so that is up to you.
**Ashton**: I mean, that's what I would prefer.
**Ashton**: So that would be.
**Ashton**: Then a mix of the light and the upper panel.
**Ashton**: I won't have you.
**Ashton**: I mean, there's a couple locations where.
**Ashton**: No, actually, there's not.
**Ashton**: There's not really any places where it goes over the stone.
**Ashton**: And even though it's close enough to that dark color, I'm okay with it.
**Ashton**: So I'll add that note to number six on here.
**Ashton**: So corners should match the panel color.
**Ashton**: And then same thing with the gutters at the.
**Ashton**: At the divide line, where it starts and stops.
**Brhoades**: Okay, so you want the corners to do the same thing.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Ashton**: Just to go over it here.
**Ashton**: And then obviously, I'll send out an email.
**Ashton**: All the trim is cool ebony, which is the black.
**Ashton**: The dark lower panel and the faux window infills are cool zinc gray.
**Ashton**: The lighter upper panels is cool arctic white.
**Ashton**: And then the other part that was in there, it says what would the.
**Ashton**: I'm assuming you're doing a deck liner underneath the mezzanine up here.
**Brhoades**: Yeah.
**Brhoades**: Under the dining room.
**Brhoades**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Ashton**: So I would request that be the cool arctic white, the same as the vertical panel.
**Ashton**: So it's all the same.
**Ashton**: Unless Alito had a different thought on that being a different color.
**Ashton**: It could always be.
**Awoodhams**: Wait, underneath.
**Awoodhams**: Underneath the mezzanine.
**Brhoades**: You're going to have that liner above the mezzanine.
**Ashton**: Above the mezzanine.
**Awoodhams**: Like you talk about the roof here.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Brhoades**: Yep.
**Brhoades**: On the underside of the roof.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah.
**Awoodhams**: That's the white.
**Awoodhams**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Ashton**: So that would be the cool arctic white.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Ashton**: Let'S see.
**Ashton**: Seven wasn't on my side, and then the last one would be eight, so we did a section through there.
**Ashton**: The easiest way that I can describe it is if we just go from the outside face of the girt to the outside face of the EFIs.
**Ashton**: Let's assume 11 inches, and then I'm assuming that can be made smaller if need be.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Ashton**: Do we just need to come up with kind of the max step and then we can work our way back.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Brhoades**: Yeah, I think that sounds good.
**Ashton**: Brandon, do you want to revisit seven?
**Ashton**: I don't know if you've had any.
**Ashton**: I put it.
**Awoodhams**: I talked to Mike yesterday about this and told him what has to happen.
**Awoodhams**: Like, basically, Rufe, it has to make a custom transition from the standing scene panel to their panel so that we keep the shingle and they have to own that transition.
**Awoodhams**: And so I'm putting an email together to their guy with the submittal that Nick sent me and to be like, here you go.
**Awoodhams**: And, and let's either get on a call or yay or nay.
**Awoodhams**: But that's where the, that's where it's at is.
**Awoodhams**: And, and Mike's like, yeah, they.
**Awoodhams**: I was like, we're not going to own it.
**Awoodhams**: Like, well, Master's not going to own it.
**Awoodhams**: Like, Rufa has to own this transition because that's going to be the, the, the biggest issue there is.
**Awoodhams**: Who owns that.
**Ashton**: Do you have any idea, like, is that just, yes, they're going to do it, or do you think that they would come back and say they're not going to do it?
**Awoodhams**: I think there's a.
**Awoodhams**: I think there's a chance that they say, no, they won't.
**Awoodhams**: Which I'll be like, look, you know, Mike, you got two choices.
**Awoodhams**: Like, because we're not going to do it, and if we do, then you are going to have to sign a release, which I can tell you none of the other owners in the, in the building are going to necessarily sign off on that.
**Awoodhams**: Unless it's like, I mean, we'll have to do a cost segregation study as far as, like, how much we're actually going to save on the, on the solar, like, credits, you know, to see if it offsets.
**Awoodhams**: But I mean, you know, to, to be like, okay, well, you have no warranty on this.
**Awoodhams**: Like, yeah, I don't know.
**Awoodhams**: That's a decision for them.
**Awoodhams**: I can't see him sign off on it.
**Awoodhams**: But who knows?
**Awoodhams**: I mean, if it, if it's technically outside the place, right?
**Awoodhams**: And it's like, okay, it's just, it's just the canopy.
**Awoodhams**: Worst case scenario, if it leaks there, you know, it's not, it's not inside.
**Awoodhams**: There's no insulation underneath it, so it's not the total end of the world.
**Awoodhams**: But yeah.
**Awoodhams**: And so in that case, if, if, let's say he's like, yep, I'll sign the release, you know, and, and Rufus Then, you know, I'll have.
**Awoodhams**: We'll have to get a detail together and I'll have to find some brake metal guy or whatever.
**Awoodhams**: I mean, maybe.
**Awoodhams**: I don't know if, if Vargo Pruden can, you know, can make a custom one foot based off of detail.
**Awoodhams**: We'll have to figure that out.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Brhoades**: Oh, we're.
**Brhoades**: Yeah, we definitely want to be part of the solution no matter what, you know, no matter what happens.
**Brhoades**: So just, you know, as soon as RUF it starts asking for information, just loop us in and we can try to get them everything and answer any questions that they have about you guys.
**Jdawson**: Are.
**Awoodhams**: You guys are going to be on this email here.
**Awoodhams**: So.
**Ashton**: Okay, but just, just to clarify, we are saying that the option where we have to lower and change the framing, that's completely off the table.
**Ashton**: So either they do the transition or not.
**Awoodhams**: Yes, it's.
**Awoodhams**: It's either.
**Awoodhams**: It's either we, we train, we do a transition piece to where the.
**Awoodhams**: Everything stays the same or not.
**Awoodhams**: But we're not going to stop and lower do a second roof like it's going to.
**Awoodhams**: We're going to.
**Awoodhams**: The only way this works is to do a transitions piece because by the time we lower it and it's.
**Jdawson**: It.
**Awoodhams**: It's not going to be worth it because then that's not even one roof system.
**Awoodhams**: Now you're just crediting half of it.
**Awoodhams**: Like it needs to be one roof system to get the credit on the entire thing.
**Gdesmit**: Okay.
**Gdesmit**: Just had a meeting with the concrete guys.
**Gdesmit**: We were hoping to discuss with Jerrica, but she is out of office until the 10th.
**Gdesmit**: Just trying to let you know that Brandon, before we had the meeting start.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah, I got that.
**Awoodhams**: I.
**Awoodhams**: I shot a note and so I'm getting with the owner to see what else we can.
**Awoodhams**: If there's somebody else working EDGE at jqol.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Gdesmit**: Okay.
**Gdesmit**: We'll probably just pass on this for right now.
**Gdesmit**: Just confirm.
**Gdesmit**: Nick, you.
**Gdesmit**: This is part of your date, right?
**Ashton**: 4.
**Brhoades**: 4.
**Gdesmit**: Is your deliverable for your structural drawings too?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Ashton**: Nick, do you think we'll have.
**Ashton**: I know.
**Ashton**: I think we'd like to do one more kind of interactive review with the PEMB model from vp.
**Ashton**: Do you have any idea when you think we might get an updated one that has the revisions that we discussed with Steve last time?
**Brhoades**: Yeah, my guess is as soon as he gets.
**Brhoades**: As soon as we get off the phone here, I'm going to go through.
**Brhoades**: Well, I guess as soon as you give me the information with the framed openings and all that.
**Brhoades**: Jeff, I'm going to hop on a call with him.
**Brhoades**: He's going to get all these answers and then we'll go through and when to see, you know, when these things are actually going to like be into a new model.
**Brhoades**: So we can make sure like all the parapets, the steel studs, the ethis and all that stuff.
**Brhoades**: Like, you know, when are we going to see that update from their perspective?
**Brhoades**: And I'll let you know.
**Ashton**: I, I assumed it'd be sometime next.
**Ashton**: Next week.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Brhoades**: Yeah, I would think so.
**Jdawson**: Right?
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Brhoades**: That was easy.
**Brhoades**: Awesome.
**Brhoades**: Thank you.
**Gdesmit**: Okay.
**Gdesmit**: With a kitchen coordinator coordination meeting next Wednesday.
**Gdesmit**: So we will continue on our design and everything from then.
**Gdesmit**: Good news is they're going to help out with the CAD coordination captive air hood design supply the kitchen equipment and the hoods.
**Gdesmit**: Quick note.
**Gdesmit**: There's nobody from me on here, is there?
**Gdesmit**: Tom, we do want to add four fans into the volleyball courts.
**Gdesmit**: The big ass fans.
**Brhoades**: Do we know how much?
**Gdesmit**: So there.
**Tom**: Well, there was some originally.
**Awoodhams**: Right.
**Gdesmit**: I, I don't, I don't believe so.
**Gdesmit**: Okay.
**Awoodhams**: Let me.
**Tom**: I, I could be totally wrong on that.
**Tom**: I'm the electrical, so.
**Gdesmit**: Yeah, there's not.
**Jdawson**: You didn't account for them.
**Gdesmit**: Correct.
**Gdesmit**: Jeff, I think we talked about him after he left yesterday again.
**Gdesmit**: But the RCP for the volleyball court doesn't show any fans.
**Ashton**: No, not on our scope.
**Jdawson**: No.
**Ashton**: Yep.
**Gdesmit**: So we're going to add those.
**Gdesmit**: So whoever, whoever's going to pick those up.
**Gdesmit**: So we'll get pricing for that.
**Jdawson**: But.
**Brhoades**: We don't know what size and where yet.
**Gdesmit**: There'll be the ten foot fans and they'll be just suspended from, you know, over, over the volleyball courts.
**Gdesmit**: Four of them evenly spaced out.
**Awoodhams**: I mean, what's the easiest thing is probably to, to hit the.
**Awoodhams**: Your beams, right.
**Brhoades**: Yeah, it's a.
**Brhoades**: I mean we got five pound collateral load.
**Brhoades**: You know, universally, technically, whether it's attaching to the frame lines.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Brhoades**: The big beams or purlins.
**Awoodhams**: So it can attach either one.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Ashton**: They don't weigh that much like the.
**Awoodhams**: They probably just center them over each court then.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Brhoades**: Typically they weigh, I mean, just a, like 2 or 300 pounds.
**Brhoades**: Maybe 400 pounds.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Ashton**: For some of the large ones they can be up to four or five.
**Ashton**: But yeah, for a ten foot one, it's probably in the 250 to 300 pound range.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Brhoades**: So we don't.
**Brhoades**: If it's under like 500 pounds, we, we don't care.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Gdesmit**: Micah emailed in today.
**Gdesmit**: Here's his notes.
**Gdesmit**: This is kind of just what he said he needed to keep going.
**Gdesmit**: The revised background when the change in the kitchen areas.
**Gdesmit**: Is that.
**Gdesmit**: Is that something that you guys are working on, Jeff, now, or is that part of what we're gonna accomplish in our meeting?
**Ashton**: Well, I think in talking with Jesse.
**Ashton**: Right.
**Ashton**: There's.
**Ashton**: There's two different ways.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Ashton**: We can show it changed now.
**Jfield**: Yeah.
**Jfield**: No.
**Jfield**: Hey, Jeff.
**Jfield**: So I.
**Jfield**: I called up.
**Jfield**: I called up the.
**Jfield**: That Daniel with the kitchen equipment, and he's gonna, number one, see if they can make the spaces you currently have work as is the.
**Jfield**: He said the most important thing is the commissary, because that's where they do 90 of what they do.
**Jfield**: So, you know, if it's not big enough to provide the space, we may have to shift those.
**Jfield**: The public restrooms up a little bit because a little closer to those doors.
**Jfield**: I don't know that is it.
**Jfield**: Hopefully that's not the end of the world.
**Jfield**: If we need to do that to get some more space in the commissary, we shift them to the left.
**Jfield**: It would just be closer to those double doors.
**Ashton**: Yeah, I mean, those double doors, there's no rhyme or reason.
**Ashton**: Those can shift as far to the west as they need to.
**Ashton**: I mean, I think the other thing that we could look at doing, obviously it's redesigned, but, you know, if for some reason we needed to shift.
**Ashton**: Vendor.
**Ashton**: The vendor wall.
**Ashton**: Right.
**Ashton**: The wall that is.
**Ashton**: Which this is.
**Ashton**: I've adjusted the drawings that we looked at yesterday, had the restroom blocks adjusted, Brandon, with the four common sinks.
**Ashton**: But that wall that is at the top of the dining.
**Ashton**: Right.
**Ashton**: That wall could shift to the north.
**Ashton**: But yeah, I think to your point, it's best to say, hey, can you work with what we have in here now?
**Ashton**: And if not, then we'll adjust so we actually know what we're aiming.
**Ashton**: Right.
**Ashton**: Just to your point, if we just adjusted it now, we're just guessing again.
**Ashton**: So I think it's better to get them to see if this works and then we can go from there.
**Jfield**: And another good thing is he said they don't need that 16 foot for the kitchen or for the pizza place because they had a gigantic square pizza oven.
**Jfield**: And then this one's, you know, rectangle and smaller.
**Jfield**: So that'll help out a lot too.
**Jdawson**: Perfect.
**Jfield**: And he just emailed us this morning, and he said by mid next week he'd have the drawings done and then he's going to go ahead and coordinate all mechanical electrical, plumbing requirements into his.
**Jfield**: The drawings.
**Jfield**: He does.
**Jfield**: And it'll give that to our Design team just to make the connections.
**Ashton**: When I send out the new bases later today that have the elevator opening on them, you could probably just forward those back to him, just say, hey, here's, here's the latest and greatest.
**Ashton**: I don't really, I don't know if the last ones we sent had the depths.
**Ashton**: The depth was increased slightly just because we shrunk the corridor back, you know, kind of as much as we could.
**Ashton**: We gained about 4 inches.
**Ashton**: But if I'm assuming anything would, would help, the widths are all exactly as we had them before.
**Ashton**: So you can just send him the new bases and you can use it.
**Jdawson**: As a, as an, as an update.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jfield**: I'm not a designer, but if they started on using the other plan, is that easy for them to just transport it on to a new background?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, it's, it's, it's.
**Ashton**: It should be just an XREF link.
**Ashton**: I don't think it should be a big deal.
**Jfield**: Okay, were you on that email then when he sent to us earlier?
**Ashton**: I can't recall.
**Ashton**: If nothing else, he's working with the worst case scenario because it's 4 inches smaller.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jfield**: Yeah.
**Jfield**: Okay, we'll just make sure we get that to him as soon as you send it.
**Gdesmit**: Next thing from Micah was just the final coordination with Ashton on the grease interceptor.
**Gdesmit**: Ashton, I assume you've seen the little markup that we sent out Jesse had put together with that green line running out to the, to this basically the sidewalk just, just next to the riser.
**Awoodhams**: Room.
**Nbigler**: But I have not.
**Nbigler**: Was that in an email?
**Jfield**: That's just my guess.
**Jfield**: Wild ass guess of what that would look like.
**Jfield**: But when they.
**Jfield**: We should like.
**Jfield**: Once he sends us his drawing showing all the sinks and drain locations, you guys can put that wherever.
**Jfield**: I would just think it'd be somewhere out front where they could access it, but it wouldn't be right next to the front door.
**Gdesmit**: You have, you did not see this, Ashton?
**Nbigler**: No.
**Gdesmit**: Okay, so the green line here, this, this was working on trying to mess with the space.
**Gdesmit**: We kind of shifted these and pulled a restaurant over here.
**Gdesmit**: But as we discussed, we're trying to keep it in line and not have to do this, but essentially just running our grease, our grease line out here underneath the rise room and then hide our tank here underneath the sidewalk.
**Nbigler**: That's the, that's the water riser room.
**Gdesmit**: This one is right here.
**Nbigler**: Yeah, we can't come out there.
**Gdesmit**: I mean, right, right here, Right here.
**Gdesmit**: Somewhere out here.
**Gdesmit**: The idea was just to kind of, you know, take a line and get it out here and not have the grease interceptor right here by the front door.
**Gdesmit**: So even if we come further out here, you know, out here, bring it out.
**Gdesmit**: That was the idea.
**Gdesmit**: I mean, I guess we could.
**Gdesmit**: Jesse, is there a reason we could go and go out the back this way too?
**Jfield**: They gotta get a truck to clean that thing.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah.
**Nbigler**: You don't want to go out the back.
**Gdesmit**: So I can, I can send you this if you.
**Gdesmit**: If you need.
**Gdesmit**: But that's just kind of the general idea as well as.
**Awoodhams**: I mean, why can't you take that 90 and 90 over where the.
**Awoodhams**: Where the restaurant is and then night and.
**Awoodhams**: And then 90 down into the.
**Awoodhams**: And then go.
**Awoodhams**: Or Ashton.
**Awoodhams**: I mean, I don't know.
**Gdesmit**: Like.
**Awoodhams**: Is that it?
**Awoodhams**: I guess.
**Awoodhams**: Let's start here.
**Awoodhams**: If.
**Awoodhams**: Where the grease trap was proposed.
**Awoodhams**: Is there anything wrong with that?
**Awoodhams**: It's just a mat.
**Awoodhams**: It's just a line, right?
**Nbigler**: No, it'll be a interceptor.
**Nbigler**: It's a.
**Nbigler**: Basically like a septic tank vault.
**Awoodhams**: Right.
**Awoodhams**: But I'm saying is the location that is on this.
**Awoodhams**: Is that okay.
**Awoodhams**: Or you're saying that's a problem?
**Nbigler**: It's a problem because we've got a fire line and a domestic line coming in there.
**Nbigler**: We got to maintain 10ft of separation.
**Awoodhams**: Gotcha.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Gdesmit**: So we could pull this down here a little bit and 90 in here.
**Nbigler**: Well, the lines themselves need to maintain 10ft of separation.
**Nbigler**: So it can't come out through that riser room because I don't think there's enough space.
**Gdesmit**: Yeah, no, we understand.
**Gdesmit**: We're sand them, pull it back here, come down and out.
**Awoodhams**: Well, but he's saying right there where that interceptor trap is, that there's a water line.
**Awoodhams**: So that's all going to have to adjust because does that goes.
**Awoodhams**: That, that line goes to the grease interceptor and then ties into the sanitary.
**Awoodhams**: Correct.
**Nbigler**: It.
**Nbigler**: It should.
**Nbigler**: Yeah, yeah.
**Awoodhams**: So our sanitary comes out the building right around there.
**Awoodhams**: Glenn.
**Awoodhams**: So in reality, I mean we need to pull that interceptor back probably closer to the building so that we maintain separation from the water line and then tie straight into the sanitary from there.
**Awoodhams**: Is that.
**Awoodhams**: I mean that is kind of what.
**Jdawson**: I don't know how.
**Awoodhams**: How long that guy's hose is, but I would think he could get there.
**Ashton**: Yeah, it would probably.
**Ashton**: We probably need to look at the civil site plan to really understand where that needs to be.
**Awoodhams**: Right.
**Ashton**: It may need to come just straight out south and not jog at all and then be somewhere in the parking lot.
**Nbigler**: Is that a thousand gallon interceptor?
**Nbigler**: Do we know how Big.
**Nbigler**: That's going to be.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Ashton**: If you look at that, there's no room at all for it to jog out that east face of that return.
**Ashton**: So it's going to have to come straight south.
**Jfield**: If you only need 10 foot of separation, like where the sewer is going currently.
**Jfield**: Like if you come out in that, you know, come out of the building in the room next to the elevator, you'll have, you should have 10 foot because the water stub and end is going to come in right up the outside wall into that room.
**Ashton**: Yeah, but you're going to have electrical feeds from the transformer, I mean all in that area.
**Ashton**: It seems highly unlikely that you can fit the interceptor in that small area and miss all of that infrastructure.
**Jfield**: Yeah.
**Gdesmit**: All the way down here and out past the gas line.
**Awoodhams**: Well, I mean what's the dimensions on a, on a thousand gallon grease interceptor?
**Nbigler**: Like six by eight, something like that.
**Awoodhams**: So can we not put like that six by eight, see where you got SS1?
**Awoodhams**: Can we not put that six by eight right up just on the north side of that SS1 in that green area right there?
**Nbigler**: Maybe.
**Awoodhams**: That'S going to give you your clearance.
**Awoodhams**: And then you just tie right in from there.
**Nbigler**: That'll bring the grease line.
**Nbigler**: That's an elevator inside the building right there, right?
**Awoodhams**: Yeah.
**Awoodhams**: So we'd have to jog.
**Jfield**: But it's only, it's only.
**Jfield**: Well, I guess you'd want it if you wanted to access it later without tearing the floor.
**Jfield**: But there's only a 14 inch deep pit on this elevator.
**Jfield**: It's not like it's got the elevator.
**Nbigler**: Okay.
**Jfield**: Yeah.
**Nbigler**: So yeah, I think, I think it can fit there.
**Nbigler**: It's not a great location as far as access and maintenance for it, but I don't.
**Nbigler**: Other than bringing it out further to the east and up closer to the sidewalk like where that SS2 node is.
**Nbigler**: I don't know what else you'd do.
**Awoodhams**: I mean unless, I mean, I would say let's try to put it right there close to the building and, and right next to that sanitary a.
**Awoodhams**: Because it's the shorter distance and I mean the only thing we're concerned about maintenance wise is that guy getting in to suck.
**Awoodhams**: Suck it out.
**Jdawson**: Right, right.
**Awoodhams**: So I mean, just bringing a longer hose.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah, exactly.
**Awoodhams**: Like, I mean how often is he sucking this thing out?
**Awoodhams**: Once a year, once a month.
**Nbigler**: It really depends.
**Nbigler**: I don't know what the operations and cooking would be like, but I mean like fast food restaurants are.
**Nbigler**: Once a week.
**Nbigler**: Sometimes more than once a week.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah, well, that's why that.
**Ashton**: That's.
**Awoodhams**: It will kill you.
**Nbigler**: That's why it's so good for you.
**Nbigler**: Because all of it's going into that grease.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Nbigler**: Only the healthy stuff that's making it to you.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah, obviously that's.
**Jdawson**: Wow.
**Jfield**: They only use beak tallow now.
**Awoodhams**: You're wise beyond your years, Ashton.
**Nbigler**: I know it.
**Nbigler**: All right, well then, yeah, that's.
**Nbigler**: That's what we'll do.
**Nbigler**: We'll sit one in there.
**Nbigler**: A thousand gallons.
**Nbigler**: Do we know if that's the right size?
**Gdesmit**: I don't have that.
**Gdesmit**: No, I don't know if that's the right size.
**Awoodhams**: How do we.
**Awoodhams**: Whose size is that, Jesse?
**Awoodhams**: Is that.
**Awoodhams**: Is that something we get from the kitchen guy or do you know?
**Awoodhams**: Or how do we.
**Awoodhams**: I've never sized a grease interceptor.
**Jfield**: Yeah, Michael will just be based on, you know, number of sinks in the.
**Jfield**: In the kitchen area where you know, each of the restaurants and wherever they're washing all the dirty dishes, like all that stuff, they'll just calculate how many sinks and.
**Nbigler**: Yeah, and a thousand gallons, the smallest that citizens allows without a variance.
**Nbigler**: But they will want calculations to show that that's enough.
**Nbigler**: It could be bigger than that.
**Nbigler**: But.
**Awoodhams**: Well, Glenn, let's you know, get.
**Awoodhams**: Get the engineer, Micah on that.
**Awoodhams**: Is he on the call?
**Gdesmit**: No, he.
**Gdesmit**: He sent me these notes here from the.
**Gdesmit**: The stuff that he needed to know.
**Jfield**: So Brandon, we'll.
**Jfield**: We'll get the kitchen designers layout mid next week, get that to Micah and then he'll have something he can make that calculation from.
**Awoodhams**: Do we.
**Awoodhams**: So Ashton, do you know like what is our.
**Awoodhams**: We could pretty much hug that sanitary, right?
**Awoodhams**: We've pretty much got from the sanitary to the building would be safe as far as size, right?
**Nbigler**: North to south, you mean?
**Nbigler**: Yeah, we just got to get that roof drain line through there.
**Nbigler**: But other than that.
**Nbigler**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Awoodhams**: So we just need to make sure that we, you know, we'll scale that out and be like.
**Awoodhams**: All right, what.
**Awoodhams**: We're assuming that it can fit in this area, which I think it would.
**Awoodhams**: I mean, I don't know how big it is.
**Awoodhams**: I mean, five restaurants.
**Brhoades**: Yeah.
**Awoodhams**: I don't know how much grease a burger makes.
**Nbigler**: But we will.
**Nbigler**: We'll throw in a thousand gallon one and then we can show you what.
**Nbigler**: How that fits in there.
**Nbigler**: It will be tight, but I think it'll fit.
**Awoodhams**: Story of my life.
**Awoodhams**: All right, what's next?
**Jdawson**: Gwen?
**Gdesmit**: Next is just.
**Gdesmit**: He needed to know a clarification to this machine room.
**Gdesmit**: I don't know if.
**Gdesmit**: Jeff, you already have this Dealt with.
**Gdesmit**: But these use right here the specs for the elevator, for the machine room fire extinguisher, you know, temperature and humidity control with thermostat.
**Gdesmit**: So Micah was just trying to get some clarification on if it needs its own H vac system.
**Gdesmit**: Can we do a mini split?
**Gdesmit**: I sent this off to the elevator guy, so unless you already know, we'll get that answer from them.
**Ashton**: No, Yeah, I don't usually it's.
**Ashton**: I mean it's no more than what they would do in a normal electrical room.
**Ashton**: He's going to have to route that.
**Ashton**: I think right now our assumption, because there's not a ton going in there, I can shoot an email to Micah and ask him if he thinks we can fit it all within that electrical room or if we're going to utilize the closet on the second floor.
**Ashton**: That electrical room is, you know, nine by seven and they need a four by four foot area.
**Ashton**: Really?
**Ashton**: Just because of the three foot clearance in front of the panel.
**Ashton**: I wouldn't see why they couldn't fit their panel and the pneumatic piece on the wall in conjunction with the main electrical panel in there.
**Ashton**: But if it needs to, if it needs to be in its own complete separate room then we can carve out a separate spot in that closet upstairs.
**Gdesmit**: Yeah, I don't.
**Gdesmit**: He didn't even ask that question about its own room.
**Gdesmit**: But self, you know, self closing, self locking, a fire rated door.
**Ashton**: Yeah, I mean that's all going to be on there regardless.
**Gdesmit**: Kitchen rough in drawings from kitchen vendors.
**Gdesmit**: Nothing to do about this is for our meeting next week.
**Gdesmit**: I don't want to include that.
**Gdesmit**: Gas and electric loads.
**Gdesmit**: Dean currently has an open ticket with Duke for their primary transformer.
**Gdesmit**: So more to come on that.
**Gdesmit**: What info does Spencer or Dean still need from either Alito or somebody to complete the load requirements for the gas and electricity?
**Tom**: The, the kitchen design that we'll get next week is the, the big one.
**Gdesmit**: That's the final.
**Tom**: Yeah.
**Gdesmit**: Brandon, this one's kind of for you.
**Gdesmit**: We got geo testing.
**Gdesmit**: Chad is working on getting with a couple firms to do testing throughout compaction, slump proof roll testing or concrete, all that stuff.
**Gdesmit**: The third party testing is that.
**Nbigler**: Does.
**Gdesmit**: That determine what, what testing is going to be required already?
**Gdesmit**: Is that, is that something the owner is covering or are we covering it?
**Gdesmit**: Is this an ad?
**Gdesmit**: We can talk offline about this.
**Gdesmit**: I just need to put this in here before I forgot about it.
**Jfield**: That'll be by us.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah, let's get the pricing and figure that out and then you know, let's.
**Awoodhams**: First steps first.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Gdesmit**: All right.
**Gdesmit**: Chad, have you gotten anything back from anybody yet?
**Gdesmit**: Chad, you're on mute.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah, we want to hear you and not see you.
**Awoodhams**: Can you reverse that?
**Awoodhams**: All right, he doesn't know.
**Gdesmit**: This one's for Ashton.
**Gdesmit**: Civil drawings provide status.
**Gdesmit**: Is there status on the review comments and the replatting?
**Gdesmit**: Ryan Collingwood?
**Gdesmit**: I think we're waiting to hear from him to look at doing replatting concurrently with their plan review.
**Gdesmit**: Mike Pierce said he was fine with that, he was going to check with Ryan, but since then we haven't heard anything back from them.
**Gdesmit**: Have you, Ashton?
**Nbigler**: I believe the replatting went away.
**Awoodhams**: So Mike called me on Monday and he was gonna.
**Awoodhams**: I, he was like.
**Awoodhams**: I was like, we're doing the deed thing, all that, blah, blah, blah.
**Awoodhams**: And he was going to talk to Ryan.
**Awoodhams**: He's like, well, you know, we might still want to plot or whatever.
**Awoodhams**: I was like, all right, look, if you want a plat, like, can you, like, if I sit, you know, if that's what you guys have to have, can you at least let me do it concurrently?
**Awoodhams**: Like, I'll get you that.
**Awoodhams**: We got the deed stuff.
**Awoodhams**: Can you let me do it concurrently?
**Awoodhams**: And that's what he was going to talk to.
**Awoodhams**: To Ryan about.
**Awoodhams**: But the other stuff that I'm more concerned about is the items where he was.
**Awoodhams**: He had the comment about the land to the west and knowing of the road.
**Awoodhams**: Did he get back to you on that?
**Nbigler**: He did yesterday.
**Nbigler**: Sent me a note.
**Nbigler**: The.
**Nbigler**: The milling limits.
**Nbigler**: Yes.
**Nbigler**: Or from our east boundary to, I think you say 50 or 100ft short of Grant Park Boulevard.
**Nbigler**: So I don't think it's any more area.
**Nbigler**: It's just sliding east as far as the milling limits for the right of way.
**Nbigler**: Grant at the intersection.
**Nbigler**: Yes, he, he understood and agreed.
**Nbigler**: So we're just gonna chamfer that corner at 40.
**Nbigler**: 40 by 40, so we can update that.
**Nbigler**: It doesn't really affect anything as far as our plan goes.
**Nbigler**: We just need to show it and then we'll.
**Nbigler**: We'll dedicate that right away, either through the plat, if that's what they end up having us do, or we can write a land description for it.
**Awoodhams**: Okay, so, so that's.
**Awoodhams**: So you've got, you've got his comments.
**Awoodhams**: So those, those are the last two things he needed on your drawings.
**Awoodhams**: And then essentially the TAC review, everything is done.
**Awoodhams**: So we can actually submit that now.
**Awoodhams**: It's just a matter of basically the, the deed stuff, which they agreed on, and I believe Katie told me yesterday that their attorney is done and was sending that in.
**Awoodhams**: I don't know.
**Awoodhams**: Have you seen it go through Ashton?
**Awoodhams**: I don't know if I have.
**Nbigler**: Have not seen anything from.
**Nbigler**: From Katie or is it Eric Douthat still that.
**Awoodhams**: Yes, Eric.
**Nbigler**: Yeah, I haven't seen anything from either of them.
**Awoodhams**: Okay, I will get that from Katie.
**Awoodhams**: And so, yeah, we'll see.
**Awoodhams**: What if, you know, Mike and Ryan are good with that kind of go from there.
**Awoodhams**: But so, yeah, so you'll get those drawings updated and then I guess, do you send them in or what's the.
**Awoodhams**: I mean, the next process is basically the.
**Awoodhams**: The 17th is the next meeting.
**Nbigler**: So, yeah, yeah, we update them.
**Nbigler**: We'll send them back through the public works plan reviewer with responses to his comments.
**Nbigler**: Hopefully Pierce has talked to the plan reviewer and explained what all these discussions have been.
**Nbigler**: But I'll include that in my response.
**Nbigler**: And hopefully the plan reviewer will either, if he hasn't heard, confirm with Pierce.
**Nbigler**: But usually he doesn't.
**Nbigler**: He just reissues comments because he's too lazy to actually make the call.
**Awoodhams**: This is recorded, Ashton.
**Awoodhams**: I'm going to use that as leverage later.
**Nbigler**: I'd be glad if you could use it as leverage and make the reviewer do something.
**Awoodhams**: Tell us how you really feel.
**Nbigler**: Do you mean leverage against me?
**Awoodhams**: Yeah, leverage against you, of course.
**Nbigler**: Oh, I'll tell that guy to his face.
**Nbigler**: That's not gonna.
**Nbigler**: That's not gonna be any leverage against me.
**Awoodhams**: Oh, boy.
**Awoodhams**: Right here's Katie right now.
**Nbigler**: He's a joy to deal with, I'll tell you that.
**Awoodhams**: I can only imagine.
**Gdesmit**: Yeah, aside from that, the last thing we just wanted to touch on these dates are what I have tracked for our current design deliverables.
**Gdesmit**: Does this look right to everybody?
**Tom**: I think the DM electrical is probably gonna align with the Spencer drawings on 44 now.
**Gdesmit**: I figured that, but I hadn't heard otherwise.
**Tom**: Yeah, all good.
**Gdesmit**: It's pretty much everything by 4 4.
**Gdesmit**: And then CDR will go up on Monday the 7th.
**Brhoades**: Hold on.
**Brhoades**: So you're getting my anchor rod drawings on 4 4.
**Brhoades**: My permit drawings don't come for another, like, week or so after that.
**Brhoades**: So the difference would be permit drawing shows all the steel, the sizing of everything, the spacing of our purlins, the roof framing, the wall framing, but no sheeting.
**Brhoades**: And then on 4 4, you're getting the anchor rod drawings, which is going to show Jerrica and everybody how big our columns are and steel line and all that stuff.
**Gdesmit**: You say the perma drawings will be the week after the 4th, it should be.
**Brhoades**: Typically, it's.
**Brhoades**: Typically it's about a week after.
**Brhoades**: Sometimes it can be two weeks.
**Brhoades**: So I don't know when.
**Brhoades**: If there is a need for a specific date.
**Brhoades**: I don't know.
**Ashton**: I mean, we'll submit the cdr.
**Jdawson**: I'm sorry?
**Ashton**: I said we'll submit the CDR regardless, since you guys are going to stamp and upload your drawings yourself anyway.
**Jdawson**: So as.
**Ashton**: As long as we have everything else.
**Ashton**: You know, since MEP drawings are all design build, they'll upload those as well.
**Ashton**: So we plan to just upload the architectural CDR on 4, 7 and then MEP and Nick's team will upload their own drawings respectively to the DHS portal.
**Awoodhams**: All right.
**Awoodhams**: Hey, Ashton.
**Awoodhams**: So I just got word.
**Awoodhams**: So they do want us to do a plat as well.
**Awoodhams**: So we're gonna.
**Awoodhams**: So she's get.
**Awoodhams**: Kay's getting with her attorney and we should have that deed today.
**Awoodhams**: So we're going to submit the deed and they're going to let us do construction and get permits based off the deed.
**Awoodhams**: But they want a plat as well.
**Awoodhams**: But it's.
**Awoodhams**: They're not going to hold us up on the plat.
**Awoodhams**: They just want it.
**Awoodhams**: So what are the next steps to get that done?
**Awoodhams**: Is that your team can draw that up?
**Nbigler**: Yeah, yeah, we can draw it up.
**Awoodhams**: Okay, so draw that up and then obviously you're going to want an added cost for that.
**Awoodhams**: So send me that number, please, so I can get with the owner on that.
**Ashton**: All right.
**Awoodhams**: In a.
**Awoodhams**: In a timeline with that.
**Nbigler**: We'Ll have it done before the end of construction.
**Awoodhams**: Man, you are just a real go getter.
**Brhoades**: Speaking of being a go getter.
**Brhoades**: Hey, Jeff, I've never uploaded anything like that before, so I don't know how difficult it is or how easy that process is.
**Ashton**: It's two clicks.
**Ashton**: It's not a big deal.
**Ashton**: So if you need me to do it, you can just send me the drawings and we'll do it.
**Ashton**: But you'll have to fill out your own.
**Ashton**: I can send you the CDR information for you to fill out?
**Brhoades**: Yeah, and we can fill that out whenever.
**Brhoades**: I'm sure we have an assigned engineer that will put in all their information and then, you know, Jerrica's information will be on that line that says like the design inspecting professional, that stuff.
**Jdawson**: Thank you.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Gdesmit**: That is the end of the agenda.
**Gdesmit**: Unless anybody has anything else to throw in here.
**Gdesmit**: Nothing.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Gdesmit**: Thank you all.
**Gdesmit**: I'll send out the meeting minutes here in a little bit.
**Awoodhams**: Awesome.
**Awoodhams**: Thanks, guys.
**Jfield**: All right.
**Brhoades**: Thank you.
**Ashton**: Thanks, guys.
