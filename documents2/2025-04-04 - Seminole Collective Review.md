## Transcript
**Jdawson**: Good morning, Justin.
**Jdawson**: How you doing?
**Bclymer**: Good, man.
**Bclymer**: How are you?
**Jdawson**: Excellent.
**Bclymer**: Good.
**Jdawson**: Living the good life here in sunny Florida.
**Bclymer**: Nice.
**Bclymer**: Nice.
**Jdawson**: Hey, I forwarded your invite to a couple people, so.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Andres is our estimator.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: But he's very nice to meet you.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And.
**Jdawson**: But he also.
**Jdawson**: He's got a background in civil engineering, so he can draw drawings for us.
**Jdawson**: So that's very helpful for us because we get so many napkin sketch projects for people and then he can draw it together, so.
**Bclymer**: Perfect.
**Jdawson**: And then I invited Whoosh to join on here because I got.
**Jdawson**: You know, we had the meeting with the city.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And they sent us the survey.
**Jdawson**: And then they're supposed to be sending me the.
**Jdawson**: The plans that were used and permitted for that parking lot when they put it in.
**Jdawson**: So we'll be able to know how they put the drainage in and all of those things.
**Bclymer**: Oh, good.
**Jdawson**: They're also doing a geo survey on the site.
**Jdawson**: So the geotech report they're going to give us, they said it's going to be like three weeks and I can.
**Jdawson**: I don't want to repeat all this when Hoosh gets on, but.
**Jdawson**: So I wanted him to be here and.
**Bclymer**: Sure.
**Jdawson**: Andres, did you send me those.
**Jdawson**: Did you email me those drawings?
**Bclymer**: It's sending.
**Bclymer**: Well, yeah, you do.
**Bclymer**: You have it?
**Bclymer**: You receive it?
**Jdawson**: Looking forward.
**Jdawson**: Here.
**Jdawson**: Brandon joining us.
**Jdawson**: There we go.
**Bclymer**: Hey, Brandon.
**Speaker 2**: What's up?
**Bclymer**: How are you doing?
**Speaker 2**: Well.
**Speaker 2**: How are you guys?
**Bclymer**: Good.
**Jdawson**: I guess.
**Jdawson**: I didn't think.
**Jdawson**: Andre, she saved them in the folder.
**Jdawson**: I could have just opened them up there, but that'd be way too easy.
**Jdawson**: See here, Brandon, I.
**Jdawson**: I got.
**Jdawson**: I invited.
**Jdawson**: Who should I talk to him?
**Jdawson**: Just a few minutes ago, short notice.
**Jdawson**: He said he could jump on, so.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: I just sent it to his email.
**Jdawson**: It's funny, his.
**Jdawson**: He's got an email because he's on the Madeira beach city council and his email is madbeaches.
**Jdawson**: Yahoo.com they first said it to me and I was like, mad.
**Jdawson**: What?
**Speaker 2**: Hey, I like it.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, some beach somewhere.
**Jdawson**: It's awesome.
**Jdawson**: He had a picture.
**Jdawson**: He had a picture in Tallahassee.
**Jdawson**: It was him and Pam Bondi just a few weeks ago.
**Jdawson**: Maybe it was a month ago, but there's.
**Bclymer**: Who.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So if he joins here in a minute, but.
**Jdawson**: So the drawings, we got their survey.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: From the city.
**Jdawson**: I'll share this here and we'll get this sent over to you as well.
**Bclymer**: Oh, good.
**Jdawson**: But.
**Jdawson**: And then Andres went in and he took their.
**Jdawson**: Basically their little design concept and he located all of the containers like these Here are the volleyball courts.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Jdawson**: These two buildings here are the cities buildings that they want to put on there for their events and use of the place.
**Jdawson**: Like these are little courts here or like seating areas, I believe.
**Speaker 2**: No, it's pickleball courts.
**Speaker 2**: But we're not going to do.
**Jdawson**: Those things are pickleball.
**Jdawson**: So these go away.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Then Andres hasn't labeled them yet.
**Jdawson**: But like these are the two restroom containers.
**Jdawson**: This is like an entrance container feature.
**Jdawson**: Like these are all the restaurant containers here.
**Jdawson**: Oh, no, this is a coffee shop.
**Jdawson**: I'm sorry.
**Jdawson**: This one here was a coffee shop.
**Jdawson**: I believe this was an entry.
**Jdawson**: They got these two entries here and they had.
**Jdawson**: These were two storage containers and they had this as a.
**Jdawson**: Like an office connects there.
**Jdawson**: Then we had.
**Jdawson**: The miniature golf was down in here.
**Jdawson**: So just looking at.
**Jdawson**: And that's what will be helpful when we get there.
**Jdawson**: The plans they use to build this because right in here they've got a whole.
**Jdawson**: I don't know how to describe it even, but they put sheet piles in, create almost a pond at this corner.
**Jdawson**: And then really there's a bunch of rip wrap behind it so that it.
**Jdawson**: Like this looks like it just drops down into here.
**Jdawson**: You know, the water was up about 6 inches below the top of those sheet piles.
**Jdawson**: And so that's the only things when we go to build this side.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And then when it comes to like this here is the outdoor seating canopy.
**Bclymer**: So would you need to shift.
**Bclymer**: Shift all that north now that you're getting rid of the pickleball and then you just move everything north to get away from all that sheet pile rip rap.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And that's a good point because like this space.
**Jdawson**: If we can move all this up.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: You know, depending on what we have to do down here.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: You know, there's no space on site currently for a retainage pond of any sort.
**Jdawson**: If that's required.
**Jdawson**: I don't know if that is or not.
**Bclymer**: I'd imagine there'd be something.
**Bclymer**: Unless it's already been built into that area.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: But then I mean that's just even more important to keep it kind of work around it.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: If this is the low area they had is, you know, their containment on site, then if we can.
**Jdawson**: Like this is a big area.
**Jdawson**: Like that would be a good size if it is the detention pond.
**Jdawson**: So then the other things that.
**Bclymer**: You.
**Jdawson**: Know, here's an overlay of the site and then that'll.
**Jdawson**: And this is what their plans, when we get them, we'll help out with.
**Jdawson**: So like this here is a big drainage swale.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Which connects like along here is a drainage soil and then through the middle of the site, like right through here.
**Bclymer**: Oh wow.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: There's a drainage swale.
**Jdawson**: So this is another thing when it comes to like, we got to get this out because we're going to have some deeper foundations for that canopy, you know, moving it out of that because we'll more than likely have to put in some under, you know, drainage pipe so that we can fill all that in.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, it'd be helpful to get that understanding and what we can actually do there and get some follow up from Whoosh too in terms of like what, what can we do?
**Bclymer**: Like does that need to be retained and almost minatized and bridge over or can you put it underground and what does that start to look like?
**Bclymer**: Because clearly there's some connection from the north side of the site to the south side.
**Bclymer**: And then what is that like where, where the mini golf is planned now?
**Bclymer**: I mean that's, that's obviously heavily wooded, which doesn't necessarily mean anything.
**Bclymer**: But to understand if there are any surprise big trees in there that we need to be aware of and from an elevation point, what we can actually do.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Hey, do you see who is he trying to join?
**Jdawson**: He said he's in here.
**Bclymer**: I haven't seen him.
**Bclymer**: I don't, I don't see him on here.
**Jdawson**: See here?
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: And they had, they were going to have a topo survey.
**Jdawson**: I believe he said that's finishing up here soon.
**Jdawson**: So we'll know the elevations of all these areas as well.
**Bclymer**: Okay, good.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, tree.
**Bclymer**: Tree survey would be helpful.
**Bclymer**: It's never fun when you get it all the way you want it.
**Bclymer**: Then you find out you've got a grand oak somewhere right in the middle and you gotta things out.
**Jdawson**: And then this was.
**Jdawson**: There's an easement through here for a future road that they said that would be not a problem.
**Jdawson**: They can just abandon that, you know, based on layout.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So it doesn't have to stay.
**Speaker 2**: It's not actually there.
**Speaker 2**: They'll just vacate it off of the survey.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And you know, then up here there's an existing drive coming in.
**Jdawson**: They put a culvert in to cross that area.
**Jdawson**: And then they just mentioned there's some, you know, we got it in the photos.
**Jdawson**: There's power lines running along this Cameron Avenue.
**Speaker 2**: It shows it on the survey too.
**Speaker 2**: It calls Ohl yeah.
**Bclymer**: Are you going to keep those there?
**Bclymer**: You going to try to go underground with them?
**Speaker 2**: See what we have to do.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: The northeast road.
**Bclymer**: Are you keeping that road to try and kind of bypassing the little sketches that they had?
**Bclymer**: It, like, bypasses the site.
**Bclymer**: Is that the intention, or is it to have another entrance into the site?
**Speaker 2**: No, because you'll keep that because the parking lot is over there on that right side.
**Speaker 2**: So you want to have access from.
**Bclymer**: From the thing.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: From Lake Mary.
**Speaker 2**: Yep.
**Speaker 2**: That would be.
**Bclymer**: That would make sense.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: That way.
**Speaker 2**: Because you're going to have all your signage and marketing everything on your.
**Speaker 2**: Your entrance.
**Speaker 2**: So.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: This.
**Jdawson**: Andres, where's the.
**Jdawson**: This thing looks like it needs to shift over to the left a little bit.
**Bclymer**: The file is in the folder.
**Jdawson**: Because it looks like the.
**Jdawson**: There's a lot more room between the road and that.
**Jdawson**: I wonder if that's.
**Jdawson**: How is that scaling out there.
**Jdawson**: This is existing right away.
**Jdawson**: Line, concrete sidewalk.
**Jdawson**: See how far back this entry is from what would be the sidewalk here.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: I'm not sure why Hoosh is not joining, but, Justin, I could.
**Jdawson**: You know, we gotta get all this, you know, all the design fees together.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And get them over to the owner.
**Jdawson**: But.
**Jdawson**: Okay, you know what?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I'm looking at this.
**Bclymer**: I guess I wasn't.
**Bclymer**: I know the.
**Bclymer**: The package had both Georgia and here, so.
**Bclymer**: And I know the Georgia concept had the.
**Bclymer**: That entry feature, kind of archway, whatever that is.
**Bclymer**: I missed that on our.
**Bclymer**: For here.
**Bclymer**: I guess it wasn't as clearly defined in their package for this site.
**Jdawson**: But.
**Bclymer**: I can clarify that and.
**Bclymer**: And resend that over.
**Bclymer**: Some of the.
**Bclymer**: Some of this is kind of standalone.
**Bclymer**: You know, the.
**Bclymer**: The two buildings up at the volleyball, the building down by the mini golf.
**Bclymer**: Some of that.
**Bclymer**: I can start on the main containers.
**Speaker 2**: The.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, the main thing.
**Speaker 2**: So.
**Speaker 2**: So, Justin, we.
**Speaker 2**: Those two buildings up top by the volleyball, those are owned by the city now.
**Speaker 2**: We don't have confirm.
**Speaker 2**: We.
**Speaker 2**: We.
**Speaker 2**: The whole idea was we said, hey, we'll go ahead and build those, you know, in our project, and you guys just pay us for them.
**Speaker 2**: The city is confirming they can do that.
**Speaker 2**: And so we don't have confirmation on that yet.
**Speaker 2**: So I'd say, if anything, the biggest place to start is that canopy dining area thing at the, you know, bottom left there.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I definitely want to get a better picture of what the intention is there.
**Bclymer**: I've seen a number of those on all scopes.
**Bclymer**: You know, like, there's one now there's a new one at Coachman park there in Clearwater.
**Bclymer**: There's up in Wesley.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I guess it's considered Wesley Chapel, the Crate area out in front of the Grove retail area.
**Bclymer**: There's like a small.
**Bclymer**: So there's.
**Bclymer**: There's different levels and.
**Bclymer**: And vision.
**Bclymer**: I'd like to get a better vision of.
**Bclymer**: Of what that amphitheater may consist of.
**Jdawson**: Have you ever seen this drawing?
**Speaker 2**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: Justin, you're.
**Speaker 2**: Or Jesse, you're on the wrong one.
**Bclymer**: Well, no, I'm just saying the Georgia one.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: But.
**Bclymer**: But still, I mean, if that's a.
**Jdawson**: They didn't have any space frame kind of thing.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, there was no.
**Jdawson**: This is the only image we have of what.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we're thinking they wanted it as a canopy.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So, I mean, the covered seating and.
**Bclymer**: And in stage, you know, like, how.
**Bclymer**: How elaborate is this stage?
**Bclymer**: Is it literally just kind of there, the backdrop.
**Bclymer**: Is it open behind the seating?
**Bclymer**: Is it built in?
**Bclymer**: Is it fixed or is it loose?
**Speaker 2**: The seating is not built in.
**Speaker 2**: It's loose.
**Speaker 2**: It's just chairs.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: There's a comment about main bar kind of right under there.
**Bclymer**: I wasn't sure what that was.
**Bclymer**: If that was something you guys were.
**Bclymer**: Had someone else building out kind of like your.
**Bclymer**: Your restaurant pods.
**Jdawson**: Are you able to hear us talking?
**Jdawson**: Oh, sorry, you are.
**Jdawson**: He's.
**Jdawson**: Oh, through the phone.
**Jdawson**: But when you're on the meeting, there's no one else in there or there.
**Speaker 2**: I just forwarded him the invite.
**Jdawson**: Okay, well, okay.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: See it.
**Bclymer**: So he's trying to join on his phone.
**Bclymer**: He can only hear us.
**Jdawson**: But he said no one was letting him in.
**Jdawson**: But I don't see anyone waiting in.
**Bclymer**: A.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I haven't gotten anything there.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, maybe you can try again.
**Jdawson**: But we just need to get you.
**Jdawson**: Is this just a single slope roof?
**Jdawson**: Is it going to be a pitched like this?
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, it's going to be arched.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 2**: The.
**Speaker 2**: It's going to be arched once it.
**Speaker 2**: We want it to be translucent.
**Speaker 2**: And then if you look at.
**Speaker 2**: So here I'll share my screen.
**Speaker 2**: So it'll be translucent.
**Speaker 2**: If you look at.
**Speaker 2**: If you look at.
**Speaker 2**: So this right here, this number five.
**Speaker 2**: This should call out being like a little bar thing.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I guess the question is, is that something being built out by the user, like your pods, or is that something that you need a container carry?
**Bclymer**: Like, is it a container?
**Bclymer**: Is it open?
**Speaker 2**: It's a container.
**Speaker 2**: So, yeah, the whole concept is that they want all these containers built out.
**Speaker 2**: Got it with those.
**Bclymer**: So we just do schematic on the outside of that one again.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, yeah.
**Speaker 2**: There's nothing to.
**Speaker 2**: To do.
**Speaker 3**: The sa.
**Bclymer**: I'm gonna share just a couple thoughts Here to see, just get an idea on a couple things.
**Bclymer**: Is that all right by Sugar?
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, go ahead.
**Bclymer**: So here, I don't know if you can see all this, but this is.
**Bclymer**: This is the crates in Wesley Chapel.
**Bclymer**: So it's got a whole, you know, so it's got container areas and then it's got the stage here.
**Bclymer**: So it's not.
**Bclymer**: It's not super huge.
**Bclymer**: It's not covered.
**Bclymer**: Obviously we could cover.
**Bclymer**: But is this like the simple kind of thing you're.
**Bclymer**: You're thinking of or.
**Bclymer**: Or something more maybe not quite this elaborate, but, you know, where it's more large covered, kind of.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, everything simple, simple.
**Bclymer**: So kind of an in between of these two things.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, like, think like.
**Speaker 2**: Because this is not a concert venue.
**Speaker 2**: This is more like.
**Speaker 2**: Think like Sparkman Wharf where they just have, like, local bands play, people hanging out there drinking.
**Speaker 2**: That's all that.
**Speaker 2**: That's all this is for.
**Speaker 2**: It's gonna.
**Speaker 2**: It's just gonna sit right in front of that cold store.
**Speaker 2**: Like those, that 15 to 16 is just storage containers.
**Speaker 2**: So this is gonna sit right in front of those.
**Speaker 2**: You know, give some, you know, people can play and, you know, hang out there, whatnot, eat food.
**Speaker 2**: That's all it is is.
**Speaker 2**: Think, think that common Sparkman Wharf area where you've got the containers, and then that, that number five.
**Speaker 2**: Is that.
**Speaker 2**: Is that bar, like what.
**Speaker 2**: The center bar is down in sp.
**Speaker 2**: So it's okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: There is Newport.
**Bclymer**: Richie's got a more simplified kind of like.
**Bclymer**: Like this kind of thing.
**Bclymer**: So it's.
**Bclymer**: It's a stage, but it's simple.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Then you could extend that covering out and you don't.
**Speaker 2**: You probably don't even need the covering because it's going to be underneath that.
**Speaker 2**: That thingy.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, it would be like.
**Bclymer**: This would be like all like extended.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right, I'll.
**Bclymer**: I'll put some thoughts together, but that, that helps.
**Bclymer**: Anyway, get.
**Bclymer**: Get an idea what you're looking for.
**Jdawson**: When it comes to the roof panel system.
**Jdawson**: Like, you know, there's the wind loads that we gotta account for and.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, like, what is the most economical.
**Bclymer**: A translucent.
**Bclymer**: Translucent.
**Bclymer**: Like what comes to mind is maybe like a cow wall or like that tensile.
**Bclymer**: Like a.
**Bclymer**: Like the tensile fabric that I showed you at Coachman.
**Bclymer**: So I think that that could be, you know, you just have a space frame with a tensile fabric between it or over it, or you go with a cow wall.
**Bclymer**: I don't know what price difference would be.
**Bclymer**: I imagine cow wall is probably not all that Cheap, but.
**Jdawson**: And does structural.
**Speaker 2**: I like the idea of the fabric.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Because, I mean, I know at Serena, we.
**Jdawson**: We actually did a fabric screen, and you can put that on and you don't have to overload your structure to handle the wind load.
**Jdawson**: That.
**Jdawson**: That would sail off.
**Jdawson**: And you just have a, you know, a written policy.
**Jdawson**: Before a storm, you.
**Jdawson**: You have to just take it down.
**Jdawson**: And if we had the same thing for that, that'd be fantastic because that would make the structure way more efficient.
**Speaker 2**: Yep.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: Because at the end of the day, this is for shade.
**Speaker 2**: Because if it's raining, nobody's here.
**Speaker 2**: Like, it's all.
**Speaker 2**: It's an outdoor volleyball mini golf.
**Speaker 2**: Like, nobody's doing that in the rain.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, that's true.
**Jdawson**: But it's Florida, so you got some of these showers just come through for five minutes.
**Jdawson**: Everyone runs under the canopy.
**Bclymer**: Well, that's true, too.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: It's a mixed bag.
**Bclymer**: It's a mixed bag.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: Which, I mean, you know, you got a little in the middle there.
**Jdawson**: It is.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: All right, thanks.
**Jdawson**: Let who listen in.
**Jdawson**: For some reason, that link ain't working.
**Bclymer**: Weird.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: I don't see anything kicking back or anything.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, let me.
**Bclymer**: I can update and clarify on those.
**Bclymer**: Those two entrance features.
**Bclymer**: I think otherwise, I think we've still captured everything.
**Bclymer**: Priority, you've said, is the design of the stage and in that covered area.
**Jdawson**: When.
**Jdawson**: When it comes to the, you know, the structure of that.
**Jdawson**: And I can ask our steel contractor, you know, what is again, the most cost efficient, you know, type of beams or columns or the trusses up on the roof.
**Jdawson**: So, like, how much would you need from that input to start your design or like, the concept of it?
**Bclymer**: I would probably start looking into, like, that tensile fabric more like what its needs are for installation, security, and support.
**Bclymer**: Get some ideas there.
**Bclymer**: Maybe talk to that manufacturer and then run.
**Bclymer**: Start with a concept and then use that to talk with your steel guys.
**Bclymer**: And we can adjust from there as we need to.
**Speaker 2**: I would think, Jesse, we could just literally do like 16 inch trusses, you know, on each.
**Speaker 2**: Each end.
**Speaker 2**: I mean, they don't.
**Speaker 2**: It's.
**Speaker 2**: It's not much, but that gives you, you know, it's.
**Speaker 2**: First of all, it's light and it's not like thick to where you can't see through it.
**Speaker 2**: It's going to let light shine through and be translucent, and it'll add a little bit of dimension.
**Speaker 2**: Powder coat of white or something like that.
**Jdawson**: Well, I just am looking at the spans here.
**Jdawson**: Like, we don't Want a bunch of columns inside their right concert area.
**Jdawson**: So how far are we going to try to span through this?
**Speaker 2**: I would think that, that again, with almost no load, I mean that trust could go, gosh, 30ft at least.
**Jdawson**: Well, yeah, like a typical.
**Jdawson**: A Warehouse Bay is 50 some feet.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, but that's.
**Speaker 2**: So that's got girders and trusses.
**Speaker 2**: And those trusses are also what, 36, 40 inches or so.
**Speaker 2**: They're a lot bigger and the load that they have to have is a lot more.
**Speaker 2**: So I mean, maybe it's 20 inch trusses, I don't know.
**Speaker 2**: But I would think that definitely that load.
**Speaker 2**: And it's also.
**Speaker 2**: You're talking about a warehouse as a flat roof.
**Speaker 2**: This is going to be sloped so that weight is going to distribute down.
**Speaker 2**: So yes, there's no snow load, there's no rain load, there's nothing.
**Speaker 2**: So yeah, I think that you can make those fairly small and span a pretty large distance.
**Speaker 2**: I mean 50ft, I think as well.
**Speaker 2**: Within reason.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: How does Andres, what does that scale out to.
**Jdawson**: On the, on the drawing width?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I want to say it was like 120 by 100 or something.
**Bclymer**: Like I, I, so 60.
**Speaker 2**: 60 each side.
**Speaker 2**: Ish.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I looked at the parking.
**Bclymer**: I did an overlay with the parking.
**Bclymer**: I came up with 18, 000 square feet.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: More or less.
**Speaker 2**: What's cool is that if we do that cloth, like we could do like a USA flag from a top since USA volleyball is the partner.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: You could do graphics on it.
**Bclymer**: You could do cool lighting on it too, like columns.
**Bclymer**: You could do something that could, you know, not just be straight, but maybe it's, you know, the tapered and you could do lighting up and you could do something kind of cool that's not too wild, cost wise.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that would be sweet.
**Bclymer**: Cool.
**Bclymer**: All right, so overall timing on this, and I know you said priority is on the, on this point here, but what kind of timing should we be targeting for for these?
**Bclymer**: I mean, I've picked up, you know, those few structures that I've mentioned and we can obviously start, start moving along.
**Speaker 2**: I mean, I, I mean back into the schedule.
**Speaker 2**: We got to have this up and running by July to hit tournament at least the volleyball section, the mini golf and stuff can, can wait.
**Bclymer**: July 26th.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So who, when and just.
**Jdawson**: And you can help us out a little on this.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Jdawson**: So the city, you know, we had a meeting yesterday with them.
**Jdawson**: They given us the survey.
**Jdawson**: They're doing a topo survey that we'll have in very soon.
**Jdawson**: They're doing their own geotechnical investigation and report on the site that we'll have in three weeks.
**Jdawson**: You know, the city like say they, they're basically giving this property or sent like a no cost lease to them because they want to be able to use the volleyball courts and stuff as part of the city's thing.
**Jdawson**: So they're putting their own two buildings on it.
**Jdawson**: So you got a motivated really building department to get this done.
**Jdawson**: Like you know we.
**Jdawson**: And they're also going to send us the plans of the exist, you know, the, the permitted plans that were used to put in that parking area and all the drone aids that's on the site.
**Jdawson**: So I would hope by next week we've got those back from those guys.
**Jdawson**: So if you have all that, like what is the timeline for being able to actually you think, get approved and be able to start construction?
**Jdawson**: Like what do you got civil wise and the permits on that end.
**Speaker 3**: To also take a trip there to look at the site.
**Speaker 3**: I would say as soon as have the survey within a couple of days I can get someone on it that I can keep up with the project.
**Speaker 3**: I would say if I were to give you a guesstimate for permit in hand, I would say 10 months to a year.
**Speaker 2**: Seriously, that's not gonna work.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that doesn't work.
**Jdawson**: Whoosh.
**Jdawson**: Like what do we got?
**Jdawson**: Like what's causing it to be delayed that long?
**Speaker 3**: As far as I'm concerned, I can spend maybe two or three weeks on the design.
**Speaker 3**: The rest is permitting and the local government's been extremely slow.
**Bclymer**: Let's take out the account for the local government.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, like let's not.
**Jdawson**: Like what is the normal like review timeline?
**Jdawson**: We submit out the plans like which all like go through all the departments we need to go through right now.
**Speaker 3**: Every project.
**Speaker 3**: I, you know, I just say six months automatically.
**Speaker 2**: How do you.
**Speaker 2**: All right, so let's just very, very slow.
**Speaker 2**: Forget the review time.
**Bclymer**: Who's.
**Speaker 2**: How long does it take you to get your permit drawings done?
**Speaker 2**: I'll deal with the city.
**Speaker 3**: Okay.
**Speaker 3**: Three weeks.
**Jdawson**: Thank you.
**Speaker 2**: There's a timeline I can work with.
**Bclymer**: So let's add a couple more weeks in there just for coordination and back and forth probably.
**Bclymer**: But I mean even if you were to say six weeks, I think that's pretty good.
**Jdawson**: And Justin, for you, like in six weeks you'd have your permit drawings ready.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: Yes, six, six to eight weeks probably with, with all the various structures here.
**Speaker 2**: Which Jesse, I mean we don't have to necessarily have.
**Speaker 2**: Justin's stuff to start pushing dirt.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jdawson**: And then the structural engineer I gotta get.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I was gonna ask you.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: It's looking like it's a.
**Jdawson**: The firm out of Pennsylvania we'll be using.
**Bclymer**: Oh.
**Jdawson**: It'S see here.
**Bclymer**: Providence.
**Jdawson**: DCI is the name of their company.
**Jdawson**: They're DCI engineers.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: I imagine you guys have worked with them before.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So I, you know, he called me just the other day to see how things are going.
**Jdawson**: But again, so that's, you know, our biggest thing now is getting the containers, you know, that coordination figured out and.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And these are going to be container like structures.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: You're going to do.
**Bclymer**: It's like a prefab deal that looks like containers but isn't really.
**Jdawson**: They came in just way too expensive, so.
**Jdawson**: Oh, that's why we're looking at.
**Jdawson**: We have another company, they can do them.
**Jdawson**: And then we just need to verify how the inspections will have to be carried out.
**Jdawson**: Whether we bring them in fully roughed in and left the walls off on the inside so everything can be inspected is probably the safest route to go.
**Jdawson**: But that's something we're still confirming.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: How we bring them in.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And who's will go over it?
**Jdawson**: We went over it earlier, but based on the initial plan and if you make a site visit and we get the drawings, it'll be all helpful.
**Jdawson**: Like next week when we have all the other documents, the tooo survey and the existing plans that were used.
**Jdawson**: And then we have to coordinate with Justin because we're going to have to shift probably for sure the stage over so it misses some of the existing drainage there.
**Jdawson**: Things like that we just want to get resolved right away.
**Jdawson**: So we're both working with the right layout.
**Speaker 3**: Visit the site this weekend if it needs to be.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 2**: And Jesse, Jesse visited and has a bunch of pictures and stuff.
**Speaker 2**: Have you sent him those?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I can send you the pictures I took who she has.
**Bclymer**: I'll take those too.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I'll share with you and Justin this folder.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: Well like it's just action for today and I'll next week I'll have a agenda put together and I'll just get a scheduled meeting with the rest of the design team and we'll start knocking this thing out.
**Bclymer**: Awesome.
**Speaker 3**: So let's see.
**Speaker 3**: I need that survey as soon as possible.
**Speaker 3**: I want to make sure that, you know, it has all the data that we need.
**Speaker 3**: So I need to verify the survey and be sure we have everything.
**Speaker 3**: So as soon as I can get that.
**Speaker 3**: It would be nice.
**Speaker 2**: You'll have it in 10 minutes.
**Speaker 2**: Andres, please make sure you send it to him.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 2**: All right, awesome.
**Speaker 2**: Jesse, call me here in a minute before I go meet with the owners.
**Jdawson**: Okay?
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Speaker 2**: Thanks, guys.
**Bclymer**: All right, thanks, guys.
**Bclymer**: Thank you.
**Jdawson**: Bye.
**Jdawson**: Bye.
