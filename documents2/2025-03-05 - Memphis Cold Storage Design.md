## Transcript
**Jrude**: Hello, guys.
**Bpearl**: Good morning.
**Jrude**: Morning.
**Dstaude**: Hey, good morning.
**Dstaude**: Sorry I'm late getting on here.
**Dstaude**: I think AJ's on a plane, so I don't know how much he can interact here, but.
**Dstaude**: So, yeah.
**Dstaude**: Good morning, everybody.
**Dstaude**: If we had an agenda for this or.
**Dstaude**: We're just wrapping things up.
**Dstaude**: See.
**Jrude**: I send this morning, I combine the lighting plan and the lighting layout and the mechanical layout, and.
**Jrude**: And I adjust the mechanical layout to match the lighting and the ceiling grid.
**Jrude**: And I send the cad drawings and PDFs this morning.
**Jrude**: I don't know if everybody got it.
**Dstaude**: Yeah, I saw your email, so that's good.
**Dstaude**: So then, mechanically, are we good to go with the drawing?
**Bpearl**: I am.
**Bpearl**: Jesse.
**Bpearl**: I'm updating the locations that Dana just shared.
**Bpearl**: So I'm just overlaying the background that she had shared this morning over top of ours just to adjust the diffuser locations.
**Bpearl**: I'm still working through the piping for the condensate disposal.
**Bpearl**: And then AJ shared some Eco B thermostats that they'd like us to incorporate this morning, so I'm going to incorporate those for the controls.
**Bpearl**: There's a couple other things I got to do to finish up the mechanicals, but last week, we're looking to shoot for the 10th, so I expect we'll be complete on the 10th.
**Dstaude**: On the 10th.
**Dstaude**: Okay.
**Dstaude**: And then one thing.
**Dstaude**: Like, I know we're finishing up.
**Dstaude**: How much more work do you have to do on the plumbing and the drain?
**Bpearl**: Because investigating the flow rates on those and sizing pumps for those.
**Bpearl**: Last you and I talked, you asked whether the evaporation rate was greater than the flow rate of the equipment.
**Bpearl**: That's something I've been investigating currently.
**Bpearl**: So as I discover what that looks like, it will dictate how the condensate is disposed of within the facility.
**Bpearl**: So that right now, I expect to have an answer for you in the.
**Dstaude**: Next day or so, because we'd like to split that up.
**Dstaude**: Like, if the mechanical is done, let's just issue that, because they're leaning towards not doing the drains and just having someone manually maintain the water in those.
**Dstaude**: So I know you've already put some work into it, but we may.
**Dstaude**: We may.
**Dstaude**: It's looking like we're not even going to do that at this point.
**Dstaude**: So if we can focus on the mechanical.
**Bpearl**: Yeah, as I said, if you want me to pause on the condensate disposal, I can.
**Bpearl**: I can do that.
**Bpearl**: If you don't want me to pursue that any further, I can incorporate the stuff that AJ sent this morning from the ecobee.
**Bpearl**: Thermostat and incorporate the stuff Dana shared for the relocation of the ceiling grid.
**Bpearl**: And then, like I said, there's a couple other things I gotta do to button up the.
**Bpearl**: The mechanical set.
**Bpearl**: But I can.
**Bpearl**: I can probably get that done if you want that sooner than the 10th.
**Bpearl**: As Jesse.
**Bpearl**: I could probably get that done by the end of the week.
**Bpearl**: If you're just looking for the mechanical.
**Dstaude**: Stuff, that would be excellent.
**Dstaude**: Yep.
**Dstaude**: And then I'll just.
**Dstaude**: We'll just see if, you know, if it's a full pause when, you know, we go through this with the owner next week.
**Dstaude**: And then we'll just cancel that plumbing and go with, you know, whatever you spent designing what you spent.
**Dstaude**: I understand that, but.
**Bpearl**: Yeah, yeah, you tell me what you need to do.
**Bpearl**: And we can accommodate as necessary.
**Bpearl**: So if they still want like a design in hand, just kind of have in their back pocket, then we can move forward there.
**Bpearl**: If they say, hey, we don't want to spend the.
**Bpearl**: Spend the time on it, then we can.
**Bpearl**: We can kind of draw a line to stand at that point in time.
**Bpearl**: Like I said, the mechanical is largely complete outside of the revisions that I'm going to be making today and tomorrow.
**Bpearl**: And I expect I can probably get that buttoned up.
**Bpearl**: Will this set need to be certified by Don for the final piece, or is this a pricing effort?
**Bpearl**: Like, what does that look like for the submission come Friday for you guys?
**Dstaude**: If they're like, we would hope they're ready to.
**Dstaude**: If they got a sign and seal, you know, the stamp on it.
**Dstaude**: And then we'll send it in as if that's what we're going to submit for permit.
**Bpearl**: Okay.
**Bpearl**: I'll have all of Don, all dying Don, certify that ahead of Friday and then I'll share with you.
**Bpearl**: The final set for the mechanical will have his sign sealed, stamp on it and all that kind of stuff ready for that purpose.
**Dstaude**: Perfect.
**Dstaude**: Because they're just.
**Dstaude**: The landlord is, you know, they push back and got a lot of things like that's part of the drain thing.
**Dstaude**: They're like, well, just tell them, you know, they can't make them install those drains.
**Dstaude**: So.
**Dstaude**: But they do have to review and approve the plans before they'll let us start.
**Dstaude**: So that's why it's important we get those submitted, let the landlord take a look at them and proceed.
**Dstaude**: So.
**Dstaude**: Good.
**Dstaude**: So.
**Dstaude**: And Diana, you're done.
**Dstaude**: Basically, you should.
**Dstaude**: Is your set.
**Jrude**: Yeah.
**Jrude**: AJ had mentioned on the email that there was like some kind of soffit by the loading dock doors.
**Jrude**: I just want the him to review the.
**Jrude**: Or you review the ceiling plan.
**Jrude**: Make sure that the lighting is not interfering with this Soffit.
**Jrude**: I don't have any sizes.
**Jrude**: Any information about that other than that.
**Dstaude**: Aj, can you.
**Dstaude**: I'm sorry, aj, can you text on this?
**Dstaude**: What.
**Dstaude**: What is the depth of that door out from the sidewall?
**Dstaude**: Aj, put down the Jack and Coke and start typing.
**Jrude**: Two feet.
**Dstaude**: Two feet.
**Dstaude**: Okay.
**Jrude**: How, how.
**Jrude**: What's the ceiling height on that?
**Jrude**: Two feet.
**Jrude**: Soffit.
**Dstaude**: Well, it'll be the same.
**Dstaude**: It should just be almost.
**Dstaude**: I don't know that they couldn't, you know, use just a piece of metal flat, like almost a straight piece of metal attached to the grid there.
**Dstaude**: That would just stick up just to finish it off.
**Jrude**: Well, that's.
**Jrude**: It's not gonna.
**Dstaude**: It's not a ceiling or anything.
**Dstaude**: Yeah, it should just like the ceiling should step out at each door to allow two feet of.
**Dstaude**: Of clearance.
**Dstaude**: Just a two foot opening.
**Dstaude**: Okay.
**Dstaude**: I don't know that some of the return will just get pulled up through the openings, but we have to leave them open because the doors are much higher than the.
**Dstaude**: In the ceiling.
**Jrude**: Got it.
**Jrude**: All right, so I'll pull back.
**Jrude**: I don't think that will interfere with any light.
**Jrude**: Light fixtures.
**Jrude**: Other than that, we can provide science sealed drawings by tomorrow.
**Dstaude**: Okay.
**Dstaude**: And then AJ confirmed the loading dock ceiling that we raised up higher.
**Dstaude**: Does that get above the door or do we also need to put a pocket at that door?
**Dstaude**: Drawing.
**Dstaude**: All right, so, Sharon, you're drawing here.
**Dstaude**: Diana.
**Dstaude**: So the ceiling basically would just step out here.
**Jrude**: All right.
**Dstaude**: And then he said we would need one here too.
**Dstaude**: So all of them would need that to indicate that pocket.
**Jrude**: Okay.
**Dstaude**: Okay.
**Dstaude**: We don't have any lights.
**Dstaude**: We don't have anything else out there that should conflict.
**Dstaude**: So I would think this may be just a ceiling opening.
**Dstaude**: So I, I don't.
**Dstaude**: I wouldn't design like framing and all that there.
**Dstaude**: I don't.
**Dstaude**: I just don't see the need for it because it's just an opening.
**Jrude**: So they're coiling doors, not overhead doors.
**Dstaude**: That's right.
**Jrude**: Okay, got it.
**Dstaude**: All right, mechanical.
**Dstaude**: We're good.
**Dstaude**: Structural.
**Dstaude**: How we doing?
**Brian**: We're doing okay.
**Brian**: We're wrapping up our details for the reinforcement and stuff.
**Brian**: I've got to look into the.
**Brian**: The knockout for the door, and I'm.
**Brian**: I've got to find.
**Brian**: I think there were some photographs of that.
**Brian**: But we're kind of wrapping our stuff up today and we'll do our qa, internal qa, QC set.
**Brian**: One thing that I did Have a question on.
**Brian**: Well, a couple things.
**Brian**: Was the.
**Brian**: The title block, do we need to match.
**Brian**: Currently, we're just on our own title block.
**Brian**: Do we need to match KSAs, or is that what everybody's rolling with?
**Brian**: Or does each consultant have their own or.
**Brian**: I wasn't sure what you wanted the set to look like, Jesse.
**Dstaude**: Yeah.
**Dstaude**: I would put your logo up there.
**Dstaude**: You targeting this one up here where it says KSA?
**Dstaude**: I mean.
**Dstaude**: Yeah.
**Brian**: Do you want me to use KSA's title block, or do you want me just use ours?
**Dstaude**: Oh, for this whole thing?
**Brian**: Yeah.
**Brian**: I assume that's KSA standard.
**Brian**: Is that right, Danic?
**Brian**: Yeah.
**Brian**: So is that what you're looking for?
**Brian**: I wasn't sure what MEP was using either, so.
**Dstaude**: Yeah, I think they'll just all have the same, you know, the project name.
**Dstaude**: Make sure those are all the same.
**Dstaude**: So if it's Memphis Cold Storage Warehouse, then you can have your own logo up here.
**Dstaude**: I don't know if you can put both of them in there.
**Dstaude**: You know, some drawings, they have the whole design team up here, but that's fine.
**Dstaude**: Just put your.
**Brian**: Okay, we'll go with ours, and we'll make sure that titles and everything line up and stuff.
**Brian**: It was just.
**Brian**: Just, like I said, a printing question.
**Brian**: I didn't know.
**Brian**: Some people want this set to look identical, like it came from one place kind of a thing.
**Brian**: So.
**Brian**: Yeah.
**Brian**: The other thing is.
**Brian**: And just I.
**Brian**: Our drawings will note this, but just.
**Brian**: Just to make sure.
**Brian**: Everybody here.
**Brian**: I think everybody here is probably aware of it, but, like, so, you know, the analysis and design we're doing for the reinforcement and so forth, that's based on, you know, the locations we have for the.
**Brian**: For the mechanical units.
**Brian**: If those change, like, during the bid process or during pricing and all that stuff, if they switch manufacturers, if they change locations, if there's, you know, whatever.
**Brian**: Any of that stuff, we need to know that, because that could affect, you know, the weight, the reinforcing, the orientation, anything like that.
**Brian**: We would.
**Brian**: We need to be informed of that just to make sure that our reinforcing is still okay.
**Brian**: And I've noted that on the drawing, but I just want to kind of say it out loud just so that we're all, you know, aware.
**Dstaude**: Okay.
**Dstaude**: Yep.
**Dstaude**: For sure.
**Dstaude**: AJ has got, I think, a couple subs looking at that, you know, in different manufacturers for the equipment, just to make sure we're getting best deal on that.
**Dstaude**: So.
**Brian**: Yeah, and we've listed the weights as given.
**Brian**: I've assumed a weight for the curbs, like a thousand pounds in addition to the unit weight for each curb.
**Brian**: Because I know they're going to be probably heavier built because it all.
**Brian**: It is a seismic design category D.
**Brian**: So, yeah, I just.
**Brian**: Again, I'm just.
**Brian**: It's.
**Brian**: It'll be noted on our drawings and just to be, you know, clear, you know, if it comes back and they're, you know, a thousand pounds more or something, it's not that big of a deal if they have to shift a foot here, too.
**Brian**: You know that.
**Brian**: I'm saying that's not that big of a deal, but just let us know of any changes and stuff like that.
**Brian**: But we should be ready to print stamp sets by the end of the week here in business on Friday, probably.
**Dstaude**: Perfect.
**Brian**: Okay.
**Dstaude**: Excellent.
**Dstaude**: Well, I appreciate everyone's help.
**Dstaude**: Is there anything you need from us?
**Jrude**: I'm good.
**Dstaude**: All right.
**Brian**: Not that I can think of right now.
**Bpearl**: Yeah, I think I'm good as well.
**Dstaude**: All right, perfect.
**Dstaude**: Well, we'll look forward to putting this together, and Friday, we'll get it sent out, and then, Justin, I'll let you know.
**Dstaude**: You know, pause it out for now on the drain.
**Dstaude**: And then if we move forward, we'll let you know.
**Bpearl**: Sounds good.
**Dstaude**: Awesome.
**Dstaude**: Thanks, everybody.
**Jrude**: Thank you.
**Brian**: Thank you, guys.
