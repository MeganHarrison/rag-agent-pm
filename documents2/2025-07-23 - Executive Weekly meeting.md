## Transcript
**Bclymer**: Hey, Brendan, can you hear me?
**Speaker 1**: I can.
**Speaker 1**: I can.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: From your side.
**Bclymer**: Honestly, I don't need anything.
**Bclymer**: I mean, so we have.
**Bclymer**: I'm glad you received that ticket from Georgia, which means they're actually going to merge that.
**Bclymer**: So I'm going to check that next week just to see if we can be.
**Bclymer**: We can check our details for application.
**Bclymer**: What else?
**Bclymer**: We're working on the Tampa.
**Bclymer**: As I mentioned you yesterday, I received a call from a lady that has made events on the aquarium and the zoo.
**Bclymer**: So I sent her everything.
**Bclymer**: So I'm waiting for her reply in her call today so I can have some updates on the timesheets.
**Bclymer**: Website was updated with the licenses.
**Bclymer**: What else do I need for you?
**Bclymer**: We're waiting still in California, even though we received the bond from Lisa, we are waiting on Arizona to send a form that.
**Bclymer**: It's a form from Verification Reciprocity.
**Bclymer**: So I already talked to them.
**Bclymer**: I already called them.
**Bclymer**: They say that hopefully today they can send it to us.
**Bclymer**: So I'm going to be on the look for that today.
**Bclymer**: Quick question to you.
**Bclymer**: Did you receive Keva's and Alex credit cards by chance?
**Bclymer**: Are they in the office?
**Speaker 1**: Let me double check.
**Bclymer**: Thank you, Sam.
**Speaker 1**: Nope, nothing.
**Bclymer**: So let me call.
**Bclymer**: Because Jesse Romero already received his.
**Speaker 1**: I thought they were being shipped down to St. Pete.
**Bclymer**: Exactly.
**Bclymer**: No, no, no.
**Bclymer**: Remember we said they were going to be sent out to Indianapolis.
**Bclymer**: Ah, no, wait a minute, you're right.
**Speaker 1**: No, yeah, we sent it to St. Pete.
**Bclymer**: You're right, because I talked to the Capital One lady and she said.
**Bclymer**: She said she was gonna send it.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: You know what?
**Bclymer**: Let me ask Eva.
**Bclymer**: Probably will be there right now.
**Bclymer**: So I'll text him.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, Kevin and Jesse are both in the office.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, let me just text him right now.
**Bclymer**: Okay, I'll do that right now.
**Bclymer**: And then, just so you know, Jack, I booked yesterday.
**Bclymer**: Jack.
**Bclymer**: Another Airbnb.
**Bclymer**: I mean, his extension for August 20th to September 14th.
**Bclymer**: So that's already done.
**Speaker 1**: That was booked September 14th.
**Speaker 1**: Jesus, I thought that job was supposed to be done.
**Bclymer**: I know, but he said that he needed from August 20th to September 14th, so that's why.
**Bclymer**: So I book it for him, of course, but just to let you know that he's taking longer.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: What else?
**Bclymer**: Oh, yeah, don't forget to do the video.
**Bclymer**: Even though I know you're busy, but whenever you have some time, I remind you to do a little video of the Q and A magazine is almost done, so I'll let you know what's published.
**Bclymer**: And other than that, that's it.
**Bclymer**: Just working with Jesse on the California license.
**Bclymer**: I call Puerto Rico.
**Bclymer**: As I told you yesterday, I already sent everything to the guy that is going to help us.
**Bclymer**: We don't need to be residents just to create a foreigner entity.
**Bclymer**: So he's going to help us with that and then from there we can apply for a license.
**Bclymer**: There's no exams involved or anything, just experience and he mentioned insurance and that's it.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so that's good.
**Speaker 1**: If there's no exam or anything, then when we apply for a license, we'll apply underneath me.
**Bclymer**: We're apply for what?
**Bclymer**: Sorry?
**Speaker 1**: If there's no exam or anything required and it's just based off experience, then we can apply with me as the.
**Bclymer**: Oh yes, okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay, sounds good.
**Speaker 1**: The only, the only time that it matter that we need to do it with Jesse is for the nascar.
**Bclymer**: Okay, gotcha.
**Speaker 1**: Anything else can be with me.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so I'll let you know.
**Bclymer**: But he's helping with that.
**Bclymer**: Other than that, payroll is good.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I mean honestly, I have everything and I always bother you if I need anything extra.
**Bclymer**: Oh, your outlook was already updated.
**Bclymer**: Yes, it was hacked by a Japanese application.
**Bclymer**: So they wanted access to your account and they actually were the people sending the IT IHR type of emails.
**Bclymer**: It wasn't harmful, but they wanted like to have access.
**Bclymer**: So yesterday I block it on the Microsoft support and immediately I changed your password and logged you off and your verification codes should be updated.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I don't understand, I don't understand why the.
**Speaker 1**: You know, because anytime that anybody logs in I have the authentication thing.
**Bclymer**: Exactly.
**Speaker 1**: And so I don't understand how somebody from Japan could be logged in without my authentication.
**Bclymer**: So the thing is that they were telling me that it's actually like an application from Japan that can bypass this by making themselves believe is Microsoft.
**Bclymer**: So that's why they don't need your verification.
**Bclymer**: So he was saying they have a very sophisticated ways to do this, you know, like they actually bypass it by creating Microsoft emails and blah, blah.
**Bclymer**: And that's why he sent me some codes that we need to add to our emails because I don't think we have an IT person.
**Bclymer**: And yesterday I texted Shelby.
**Bclymer**: Shelby, she told me no, you haven't, you guys.
**Bclymer**: I mean we don't have like the IT department for you.
**Bclymer**: So she sent me another person that might be helping us to.
**Bclymer**: It's called the DNS.
**Bclymer**: You know, it's like an extra support from the emails.
**Bclymer**: So I'm just going to talk to this guy and ask how much it'll be cost to add those DNS and if he can help us with that, if he can do some maintenance of our emails.
**Bclymer**: Because for example, Glenn was receiving a bunch of spam.
**Bclymer**: He was the one clicking it and I was like, don't click, don't download.
**Bclymer**: So every time he receives something weird, just send it to me.
**Bclymer**: And he's like, can I click?
**Bclymer**: And I'm like, don't click.
**Bclymer**: So to do that in order to avoid this type of emails that we are receiving.
**Bclymer**: So I'm going to talk to this IT person that it was suggested for them just to see how it goes.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so we can have an extra.
**Speaker 1**: You can also.
**Speaker 1**: We, we also, we have the under Total Tech for Best Buy.
**Speaker 1**: You can talk.
**Speaker 1**: That is our IT support.
**Bclymer**: Oh, really?
**Bclymer**: Total Tech?
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, we, yeah, we pay for that.
**Bclymer**: Oh, that's awesome.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so I'll talk, I'll contact them today just to see if they can help us with those DNS and if they can do maintenance, you know, like probably once a month.
**Bclymer**: So, you know, these reminders of, guys, change your passwords or guys, we're just.
**Speaker 1**: Gonna, they won't, they won't, they won't do any maintenance or anything like that.
**Speaker 1**: It's, it's.
**Speaker 1**: You just, it's basically just like things like again, like if, if there's an IT issue, like here's a, here's an issue and take care of it.
**Speaker 1**: They're not, they're not going to do maintenance.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So I'm going to talk to them, but still I'm going to have the other person just to see because we have a lot of things on the email, you know, like important everything, dates and even payments and even though your insurances and everything and even big amounts of money.
**Bclymer**: So I'm going to check this guy just to see how much it'll be for, you know, like a maintenance monthly or something like that so we can make sure everything is fine on our end and we don't receive those emails anymore.
**Bclymer**: So that's on my end working on that.
**Bclymer**: And then I'll contact Best Buy as well.
**Bclymer**: Waiting on Charles to see if he wants to sign the offer letter so I can set him up.
**Bclymer**: And other than that, that's it.
**Bclymer**: Then we have everything.
**Bclymer**: And again, if I need anything, I'll bother you.
**Speaker 1**: How are you coming on Buy back your time?
**Bclymer**: Oh, you mean the audiobook?
**Bclymer**: It was really good.
**Bclymer**: I mean, I have it already on my audible, but it's good.
**Bclymer**: I was reading some of the things that you said, like when you delegate people to do the things, you know, like they know how to do it so you can gain your time.
**Bclymer**: Oh, you remind me actually talking about that.
**Bclymer**: So we need.
**Bclymer**: I need to text Sam for your pictures on your social media.
**Bclymer**: So I already posted some of the things but now you remind me on the back of back to back back by your time.
**Bclymer**: I need to ask Sam for the other ones.
**Bclymer**: He has them for the running with the bones so I need to post them for you.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: So that's it.
**Bclymer**: And if you need anything let me know.
**Bclymer**: But I'm working on other stuff too with Jesse and accounting team as well and having everything set up.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, sounds good.
**Speaker 1**: I appreciate it.
**Bclymer**: Of course.
**Bclymer**: Let me know if you need anything.
**Bclymer**: I'm here and then I'll let you know.
**Bclymer**: I bother you if anything.

**Speaker 1**: All right, cool.
**Bclymer**: Bye.
