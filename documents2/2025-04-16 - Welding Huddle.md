## Transcript
**Crusin**: Hey, guys.
**Colbyhjrllc**: What's going on?
**Colbyhjrllc**: Oh, it's just candid.
**Crusin**: What's up, Gandon?
**Crusin**: What's going on, A.J.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Oh, it's another day.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Colby just accepted the invite, so he should be able to hop on here soon.
**Speaker 2**: Okay.
**Crusin**: Like that picture back there.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Go Hoosiers, baby.
**Crusin**: Yeah, That's a cool picture of the court.
**Colbyhjrllc**: I got that one.
**Colbyhjrllc**: And then the one you can't see further back.
**Colbyhjrllc**: The other one is a picture of Bob Knight, his famous hell yeah throwing the chair across the field against Purdue.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Yeah, it's signed by him.
**Colbyhjrllc**: It's kind of cool.
**Crusin**: Oh, no.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Yeah.
**Crusin**: Damn, that is awesome.
**Speaker 2**: Oh.
**Crusin**: So I was talking to Jonathan, obviously, just getting his rundown on what he needs.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: See here?
**Crusin**: Yeah.
**Crusin**: So I kind of was telling you this morning, he's planning on having some robots, or at least a guy come out next Monday to take a look at that and possibly start trying to fire up some of those.
**Crusin**: So I gotta talk with Earl and try to figure out a game plan for that main and getting those connections up above the rack.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Because I'm not sure what they.
**Crusin**: Yeah, so I'm going to try to figure out a game plan with him because the OPEX lifts are the only ones that are allowed in aisle one and two right now.
**Crusin**: Just because they have the charge rail down.
**Crusin**: And the OPEX lifts, I don't think are going to get all the way up to where they need to connect.
**Crusin**: So they're going to have to kind of be up on the side of the lift or maybe set something up in the center of the lift to get them up another, like, two feet to make that connection.
**Crusin**: Okay, so I'll obviously coordinate with Earl here after the meeting.
**Crusin**: They're on lunch right now, so try to come up with a game plan, because it sounds like we're kind of running out of time or at least space to get that main all connected up above the rack.
**Crusin**: So I just kind of want to get his thought process and how he's going to go about that and get that done without causing issues with those guys, you know?
**Colbyhjrllc**: Yeah, I hear you.
**Colbyhjrllc**: I just.
**Colbyhjrllc**: I'm ready for it to be done.
**Crusin**: I hear you.
**Crusin**: Right.
**Crusin**: At all costs.
**Crusin**: Right.
**Colbyhjrllc**: All right, I'm gonna let Colby in here, and we'll start going through this.
**Crusin**: All right.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Think.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Oh, I thought so.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Huh?
**Colbyhjrllc**: I just saw him pop up.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Text them.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Oh, here he is.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Hey, what's up, Colby Canon.
**Colbyhjrllc**: I love it, but the hair's getting long.
**Crusin**: I know.
**Crusin**: I gotta get a haircut.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Let it go.
**Colbyhjrllc**: That's what Mine looked like this time last year.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Liz made me cut it.
**Crusin**: Yeah, during the winters, I usually just let it go.
**Colbyhjrllc**: What's going on, Toby?
**Speaker 2**: Trying to mute this thing.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Can you hear me?
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, I can hear you.
**Speaker 2**: Sorry, we.
**Speaker 2**: I gotta get a mic on my computer.
**Colbyhjrllc**: You're good.
**Speaker 2**: And I was trying to find the call in, and it wasn't.
**Speaker 2**: I couldn't find the call in number.
**Colbyhjrllc**: I can.
**Colbyhjrllc**: I can.
**Colbyhjrllc**: I can hear you just fine now.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Colbyhjrllc**: So are you able to see my screen right now?
**Speaker 2**: Yes.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Okay.
**Crusin**: All right.
**Colbyhjrllc**: That's the important part.
**Colbyhjrllc**: So I.
**Colbyhjrllc**: I went ahead and started marking this up.
**Colbyhjrllc**: I want.
**Colbyhjrllc**: I want to start with.
**Colbyhjrllc**: I think I want to start with the SOPs each night.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Okay, so this is what Ulta requires us to do each night.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Canon and I will be there to help Colby.
**Colbyhjrllc**: But this just gives you an idea of.
**Colbyhjrllc**: I just typed this up.
**Colbyhjrllc**: I take the notes from my meeting, but.
**Colbyhjrllc**: And I'll send this to you guys.
**Colbyhjrllc**: So, number one, this is the first thing Michael Clay said.
**Colbyhjrllc**: He said, the DC raises concern.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Stop, Colby.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Kind of what we chatted about yesterday.
**Colbyhjrllc**: You ran into that issue before with them.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Like they didn't let you work any anymore.
**Colbyhjrllc**: I'm just gonna say that again.
**Colbyhjrllc**: You know, obviously, costs will be incurred if that happens, but if we do everything right to give them the warm and fuzzies, it won't happen.
**Colbyhjrllc**: So barring an act of God, number two, we open the dock doors so there's no ventilation in this whole entire building.
**Colbyhjrllc**: That's why it's a lot different.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Usually, like in Greenwood, they were able to pull the air out and up.
**Colbyhjrllc**: They had exhaust fans.
**Colbyhjrllc**: They don't have that here.
**Colbyhjrllc**: So we open the dock doors for cross ventilation.
**Colbyhjrllc**: And then in our report that me and Canon will send every night, we track the prevailing wind, let them know what the weather's like.
**Colbyhjrllc**: And then we put snow fence across the open doors, attach it with the carabiner they provided that last time.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Our.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Our job to put it up, though, number three.
**Colbyhjrllc**: So the mitigation each night will send photos of the setup with the report.
**Colbyhjrllc**: So.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Oops, not fans.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Fans up high and lifts to push air.
**Colbyhjrllc**: I think with where this layout is, Colby, where we're welding, we should be able to.
**Colbyhjrllc**: So I have it outlined here in clouds.
**Colbyhjrllc**: These are the joists we're welding.
**Colbyhjrllc**: This is D mod.
**Colbyhjrllc**: We should be able to set the fans up on demod.
**Colbyhjrllc**: And that'll push the air so we don't have to take up a lift.
**Colbyhjrllc**: So that we should be good there.
**Colbyhjrllc**: But so Pictures of those setups, and then the smoke eaters with snorkels.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Obviously, we've talked about that.
**Colbyhjrllc**: And each lift with each welder, and then fire blankets.
**Colbyhjrllc**: So we'll send pictures of the setup, send it to Michael.
**Colbyhjrllc**: That way it's all documented, and say, hey, here's what we did for mitigation.
**Colbyhjrllc**: And they.
**Colbyhjrllc**: They won't raise a red flag.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Then firewatch, one hour after the last spark flash, number five picture, the hot work permit each night signed off.
**Colbyhjrllc**: This is something Candon and I will help with, at least at the start, to get it going.
**Colbyhjrllc**: You'll start becoming friends with the maintenance team.
**Colbyhjrllc**: They're nice guys, for the most part.
**Colbyhjrllc**: They just like to be involved and be heard.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Guys just make them feel like they're involved, and then everybody gets happy, even though they don't know much.
**Colbyhjrllc**: And then, Colby, I talked about equipment submittals.
**Colbyhjrllc**: We just want to know what equipment's on site.
**Colbyhjrllc**: And then the welding material submittals.
**Colbyhjrllc**: The reason they made us do this is because when they started complaining about smoke, they had one person complain about a headache.
**Colbyhjrllc**: And, you know, big company like Ulta, they're like, oh, we have a lawsuit on our hands.
**Colbyhjrllc**: I want to know what this person was inhaling.
**Colbyhjrllc**: That's pretty much it.
**Colbyhjrllc**: So just to cover all of our bases.
**Colbyhjrllc**: So that's real quick, the level we have to go through each night.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Any questions, Colby?
**Speaker 2**: I don't think so.
**Speaker 2**: Okay.
**Speaker 2**: I mean, I just need to get you the submittals, middles and stuff.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Yeah, perfect.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Okay.
**Colbyhjrllc**: So schedule wise, I put this together with Vargo.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Not that.
**Crusin**: Second.
**Crusin**: Here.
**Colbyhjrllc**: I'll attach this in the email at the end.
**Colbyhjrllc**: So here I pretty much have each day planned, Colby.
**Colbyhjrllc**: So D.C.
**Colbyhjrllc**: knows where we're at.
**Colbyhjrllc**: What's our work hours from 6:00 at night to 6 in the morning.
**Colbyhjrllc**: That's when you can work.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Obviously, you're probably not gonna be there for 12 hours, you know, because there's setup time associated with it.
**Colbyhjrllc**: You roll in at 6, start setting up, usually spikes, sparks.
**Colbyhjrllc**: At least with the crew I worked with last, we wouldn't.
**Colbyhjrllc**: You know, you got to get the fire blankets, fan set up, get rolling.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Sparks wouldn't start flying until 9 o'clock sometimes.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Right.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Weld from nine to.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Or maybe if you get going by eight, weld for four hours, five hours, six hours, whatever that is.
**Colbyhjrllc**: And then, you know, you got the fire watch at the end.
**Speaker 2**: All right, so one thing I did think about, and Sunday's Easter, so I'm not.
**Speaker 2**: I mean, my guys are going to have the opportunity to go to church and stuff Sunday morning before they head.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Out, sure as they should.
**Speaker 2**: I know, I know.
**Speaker 2**: Monday night wasn't.
**Speaker 2**: We weren't gonna plan on a whole lot Monday night anyway, so it's probably going to work out best.
**Speaker 2**: So it may not.
**Speaker 2**: May not be.
**Speaker 2**: If we're not really doing a whole lot Monday night, we're just kind of trying to get layout and get a few things set up, because it may not be the full crew there Monday night.
**Speaker 2**: As far as the wealth and stuff, we might pull them in Tuesday night if that's not a problem, or they're gonna basically do a show up and, you know, I know we said probably Monday, we're not going to be doing a whole lot anyway.
**Speaker 2**: Right?
**Speaker 2**: That's what your plan was.
**Colbyhjrllc**: I.
**Colbyhjrllc**: That's why I, I baked in here.
**Colbyhjrllc**: I'm just taking notes here on something like.
**Colbyhjrllc**: So, yeah, second year Easter, maybe not.
**Speaker 2**: So.
**Speaker 2**: I think so.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Yeah.
**Colbyhjrllc**: So I have a discovery night Monday that way.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Me and Candon Canon.
**Colbyhjrllc**: I didn't actually.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Didn't really think about that until now.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Are you good to fly out then, Monday during the day?
**Colbyhjrllc**: Yeah.
**Colbyhjrllc**: You're muted.
**Crusin**: Yeah, I'm good for whatever.
**Colbyhjrllc**: I think that's what I.
**Colbyhjrllc**: I'm gonna do too, Colby.
**Colbyhjrllc**: I'm not gonna fly out until Monday during the day, and then we'll.
**Colbyhjrllc**: We'll just powwow Monday night.
**Speaker 2**: Okay.
**Colbyhjrllc**: And huddle.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: I mean, if we can look at getting, you know, basically we need to make sure we got layout and, and, you know, be able to.
**Speaker 2**: To get going Tuesday.
**Speaker 2**: Make sure.
**Speaker 2**: I mean, you know, they'll have equipment there.
**Speaker 2**: Kind of go over it, but I don't want to waste the night.
**Speaker 2**: But in the same way, you know, I didn't, I didn't even think about Easter till last night.
**Speaker 2**: For some reason, I'm like, man, Sunday's Easter.
**Speaker 2**: You know, usually it's not a big deal, but we try to make sure everybody can.
**Speaker 2**: We try to make sure everybody can, especially on Eastern and some of the.
**Speaker 2**: The bigger Sundays, we try to make sure everybody can go to church and spend time with.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Yeah, no, it's.
**Colbyhjrllc**: It is a big deal.
**Colbyhjrllc**: It's important.
**Colbyhjrllc**: So I know my wife would be all over me if I was flying out Sunday.
**Colbyhjrllc**: So she actually reminded me of that last night when I was starting to put all this together.
**Colbyhjrllc**: So I'm.
**Colbyhjrllc**: I'm with you there.
**Colbyhjrllc**: So that's why.
**Colbyhjrllc**: So I have a discovery night Monday night.
**Colbyhjrllc**: That's where we can hop up in a Lift.
**Colbyhjrllc**: I can show you what we did previously, and we can just map out what I have planned here.
**Colbyhjrllc**: And then Tuesday night.
**Colbyhjrllc**: So over.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Our first welding location we have planned is over this replan platform, and Nate knows about this.
**Colbyhjrllc**: It's going to be a lot to work around.
**Colbyhjrllc**: This will be this girder here, right here.
**Colbyhjrllc**: And if I overlay it on this, this is all.
**Colbyhjrllc**: This is up above.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Here's your platform.
**Colbyhjrllc**: This is all conveyor we're working through now.
**Colbyhjrllc**: These columns are actually what is below.
**Colbyhjrllc**: And so I'm hoping that with, like, some baker scaffold or something, we'll be able to wheel in between these conveyors, but I'm not sure.
**Colbyhjrllc**: So we may have to build some scaffolding or something.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Colby and Nate.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Nate's actually the one that pointed this out when we were walking through.
**Crusin**: So you're talking.
**Crusin**: You're talking about over that mess?
**Colbyhjrllc**: Yeah, yeah.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Okay.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Nate, I didn't know you were here.
**Crusin**: Yes, sir.
**Crusin**: Yeah, yeah.
**Colbyhjrllc**: We.
**Crusin**: We've got hanging scaffolding for that.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Okay, well, whatever we got to do.
**Colbyhjrllc**: This is so.
**Colbyhjrllc**: So I.
**Colbyhjrllc**: I got this first night here marked as so discovery.
**Colbyhjrllc**: And then scaffolding slash.
**Colbyhjrllc**: If we can get that set up quick, we may be able to start having sparks fly Tuesday night.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Okay.
**Colbyhjrllc**: So that.
**Colbyhjrllc**: That's kind of our.
**Colbyhjrllc**: We can start Tuesday night.
**Colbyhjrllc**: But we're gonna be.
**Colbyhjrllc**: No one's gonna be us.
**Colbyhjrllc**: So easy to get going.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Right.
**Colbyhjrllc**: That's why I have that planned first.
**Colbyhjrllc**: And then I have the following two days to finish that girder.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Okay, so you were.
**Colbyhjrllc**: You were asking what welding we're doing on the girder.
**Colbyhjrllc**: So if I look here.
**Colbyhjrllc**: George gritter reinforcement.
**Colbyhjrllc**: So 06s12.
**Colbyhjrllc**: I boxed out what I believe to see this as.
**Colbyhjrllc**: So this is going to be 06s12.
**Colbyhjrllc**: So we got to do that bar number four bar on the bottom and the top cord for how long?
**Colbyhjrllc**: The whole length.
**Speaker 2**: Where.
**Speaker 2**: Where is that.
**Speaker 2**: Where is that stated?
**Speaker 2**: That's the whole length.
**Speaker 2**: I'm not being a prick here, but where's that?
**Colbyhjrllc**: No, you're not being a prick.
**Colbyhjrllc**: That's.
**Colbyhjrllc**: It's a.
**Colbyhjrllc**: It's.
**Speaker 2**: And what about any web reinforcement on that?
**Colbyhjrllc**: I didn't see any web reinforcement, so I will.
**Colbyhjrllc**: I will double check with the structural engineer.
**Speaker 2**: Because if you go.
**Speaker 2**: If you go to page 10 down there, everything else is laid out.
**Colbyhjrllc**: It's bolded for you.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: And well, so go.
**Speaker 2**: Go down.
**Speaker 2**: Go down right there.
**Speaker 2**: Click on that.
**Speaker 2**: So see how everything else has, you know, layout details.
**Speaker 2**: We should have the same thing for the Girder.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Yeah, I had it listed somewhere.
**Colbyhjrllc**: I'm gonna.
**Colbyhjrllc**: I'll.
**Colbyhjrllc**: I'll loop in the structural engineer.
**Colbyhjrllc**: I'll have that info for you.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Okay.
**Colbyhjrllc**: It's my understanding, though, that it's going to be the whole length.
**Colbyhjrllc**: So if you look here, this is a joy.
**Colbyhjrllc**: So we're not doing the joist anymore, means we're not doing the seat reinforcement.
**Colbyhjrllc**: It's a good point, Colby.
**Speaker 2**: So I'm saying usually there's a.
**Speaker 2**: There's a profile detail that shows us.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Yeah, we should.
**Speaker 2**: Yes, we should have one of those for the girder.
**Colbyhjrllc**: I'll ask Rom.
**Colbyhjrllc**: I'll ask the question.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Okay.
**Speaker 2**: Okay.
**Colbyhjrllc**: I'm gonna guess it's the whole length.
**Speaker 2**: So it.
**Speaker 2**: What.
**Speaker 2**: What happens.
**Speaker 2**: You have three days planned out for that.
**Speaker 2**: What happens if we finish that early and within those three days, if we get day two and we're wrapping it up?
**Colbyhjrllc**: Huh?
**Speaker 2**: Because you have 14 days scheduled right now, and I don't have 14 days building my schedule.
**Colbyhjrllc**: I have 14 days built in because I know how it sometimes is with these guys, Colby.
**Colbyhjrllc**: And if we ask for more days, that's a problem.
**Colbyhjrllc**: So this decant area, which is right here.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Right here.
**Colbyhjrllc**: And then this D mod, this is trafficked during the week, so.
**Colbyhjrllc**: And Ulta will not shut down operations, so we can only do this during the weekend.
**Colbyhjrllc**: So that's Friday night, Saturday night, and Sunday night.
**Colbyhjrllc**: So I want to see how it goes Tuesday, Wednesday, and then we're gonna have to reassess.
**Colbyhjrllc**: You know, I don't know how quick you're gonna get that done.
**Colbyhjrllc**: And so my only thought is the only place we can hop over to.
**Crusin**: Can you swap over to your overview?
**Colbyhjrllc**: Yeah.
**Colbyhjrllc**: This one.
**Crusin**: Yeah.
**Crusin**: Zoom in.
**Crusin**: All right, so what areas are.
**Crusin**: Are we.
**Colbyhjrllc**: So these five.
**Colbyhjrllc**: These five joists have to be done on the weekend.
**Colbyhjrllc**: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
**Colbyhjrllc**: You see here?
**Speaker 2**: Profile.
**Crusin**: Are they okay?
**Crusin**: And that.
**Crusin**: Okay, so that girder moved from what me and you talked about.
**Crusin**: You said they were side by side.
**Crusin**: That's on the other side of that.
**Crusin**: I did not plan for that.
**Colbyhjrllc**: What girder?
**Colbyhjrllc**: We looked at this one and we looked at this one.
**Crusin**: Yeah, we looked at.
**Crusin**: We looked at those two right there, and it's.
**Crusin**: It's the one directly across from.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Okay, yeah, this is the one that's over demod.
**Colbyhjrllc**: That we can access with ladders.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Yeah, it's actually easier than that one because we won't have as much people.
**Colbyhjrllc**: We want people below us.
**Colbyhjrllc**: I think it is.
**Colbyhjrllc**: I don't know that well.
**Crusin**: The.
**Crusin**: The one.
**Crusin**: The one behind it's what I was worried about because we looked at the other one beside it.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Which one are you talking about here?
**Crusin**: So where your mouse is right now, we looked at that one and the other one beside it, you got highlighted in red.
**Colbyhjrllc**: This one.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Crusin**: Yeah.
**Crusin**: We did not look at the one that's down here.
**Crusin**: Yeah, yeah.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Well, that's the one that's over the.
**Colbyhjrllc**: The replan platform that we'll have to build the scaffolding from.
**Crusin**: That's.
**Crusin**: I'm pulling up my pictures right now.
**Speaker 2**: All right.
**Speaker 2**: Can you zoom in and that.
**Speaker 2**: Because that type is different than what I show.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Zoom in where?
**Speaker 2**: Right.
**Speaker 2**: Right where your mouse is.
**Speaker 2**: Zoom into that square.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Colbyhjrllc**: So I've type.
**Colbyhjrllc**: I have type four and type one here.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: So the details I show Those are type 1, type 1, type 1, and type 2.
**Speaker 2**: Type 2.
**Speaker 2**: Type 2.
**Colbyhjrllc**: I don't know what drawings you're looking at, Colby.
**Colbyhjrllc**: So type two is over here.
**Crusin**: Right.
**Colbyhjrllc**: I'm just talking about these.
**Speaker 2**: But that's.
**Speaker 2**: The drawings I have don't match yours.
**Colbyhjrllc**: That's not good.
**Colbyhjrllc**: I mean, Drew may have sent the wrong drawing.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Can you forward me what you're looking at?
**Speaker 2**: I can.
**Speaker 2**: It's dated 12.
**Speaker 2**: 9 of 24.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Mine is dated 12.
**Colbyhjrllc**: 9 of 24.
**Speaker 2**: So maybe mine's got an extra two at the front of it as well.
**Colbyhjrllc**: An extra two?
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, it's 222049222.
**Speaker 2**: That's not even the same drawings.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Yeah, I'm not.
**Colbyhjrllc**: I'm not sure what you're looking at.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Will you forward me what you're looking at in emails?
**Colbyhjrllc**: Get to the bottom of it.
**Colbyhjrllc**: So, essentially, with all these joists, all we're doing, we have.
**Colbyhjrllc**: We have previously welded all of these.
**Colbyhjrllc**: We're just reinforcing the centers of these joists.
**Colbyhjrllc**: After I hopped up in a lift, and that's what I noticed.
**Crusin**: So what about the webs that were.
**Crusin**: Which.
**Crusin**: What I was going off of is what he has.
**Crusin**: So if that's different than what I was looking at.
**Crusin**: Different.
**Crusin**: But there was webs missing for what we had over here.
**Crusin**: There are.
**Colbyhjrllc**: There are a couple webs missing.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Yeah.
**Colbyhjrllc**: So.
**Colbyhjrllc**: So we would.
**Crusin**: We.
**Colbyhjrllc**: We went to the scent and left a couple feet out on the center on all of these.
**Colbyhjrllc**: And now they're having us basically finish the weld.
**Colbyhjrllc**: So if you go to see type one, Type one, we have to add basically this portion.
**Speaker 2**: Hold on, man.
**Speaker 2**: Let me pull that up online real quick, because that might not change.
**Speaker 2**: It may just change the.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, well, type four is a whole lot lighter now.
**Speaker 2**: Look, see his.
**Crusin**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: I'm saying I don't think it's gonna hurt us because.
**Speaker 2**: Okay, as long as we're not throwing type three in there, because type three is the heaviest one for sure.
**Speaker 2**: But I think it.
**Speaker 2**: Where I had type ones, you've got type fours.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Yeah, we don't have any type threes.
**Colbyhjrllc**: All we have is type 1, type 2, and type 4.
**Crusin**: 2, 2, 2, 2, 2,.
**Colbyhjrllc**: 1, 1, 1, 4, 4, and then all ones right here.
**Colbyhjrllc**: So on these ones, like these joists right here, I think you'll be able to get that done in a night and a half.
**Colbyhjrllc**: That is just the sinners of them.
**Colbyhjrllc**: So we.
**Colbyhjrllc**: We've reinforced up to panel five.
**Colbyhjrllc**: And so you'll just have to do one angle and then about 4 foot of weld and 1 foot of weld, top and bottom cord.
**Colbyhjrllc**: And if you see this note here, the joist is already reinforced in the designated area.
**Colbyhjrllc**: You don't have to reinforce it.
**Colbyhjrllc**: I checked a lot of these.
**Colbyhjrllc**: So I.
**Colbyhjrllc**: I know, like, on these type ones, you see, we'll have to do the majority of the middle.
**Colbyhjrllc**: And then these type twos, you can see where it's marked here.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Those are the bigger portions of the middle we have to do.
**Colbyhjrllc**: So that's this area right here.
**Speaker 2**: Okay.
**Colbyhjrllc**: You can see it right here boxed out.
**Colbyhjrllc**: These right here.
**Colbyhjrllc**: There's a lot to work around here.
**Colbyhjrllc**: That's why I think it's going to take you some time, Colby.
**Colbyhjrllc**: That's why I built in two weeks there, because I know it's way harder to ask for more than it is to ask for less.
**Speaker 2**: So I guess that's my question, is if we're running ahead of schedule, are we going to be able to move, or are we going to be basically stuck where we're at?
**Colbyhjrllc**: It depends on where we move to.
**Colbyhjrllc**: So that's why, like, I have some gap in here.
**Colbyhjrllc**: So let's say we get all this done in the two nights.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Okay.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Then we'll move to D can area and knock this out.
**Colbyhjrllc**: We.
**Colbyhjrllc**: We could possibly move over to this area.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Really, the.
**Colbyhjrllc**: The important.
**Colbyhjrllc**: The important thing is this section, which I labeled as.
**Colbyhjrllc**: As decant area on this schedule.
**Crusin**: And.
**Colbyhjrllc**: This girder right here, which is over D mod, has to be done on the weekends.
**Speaker 2**: Okay.
**Crusin**: So we can get over that compactor and everything during the week.
**Colbyhjrllc**: So that would be the inbound area.
**Colbyhjrllc**: And I.
**Colbyhjrllc**: And.
**Colbyhjrllc**: And I.
**Colbyhjrllc**: I wrote in here thinking, you know, if.
**Colbyhjrllc**: If the demod takes you a little longer in that D can area.
**Colbyhjrllc**: So I have inbound, which is just those three joists over here.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Nate and Colby, I have that.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Maybe taking you one night and a half.
**Colbyhjrllc**: And so let's say we get these done quick, then we can hop over and finish decant.
**Crusin**: That's what I'm asking.
**Crusin**: If we finish everything during the week minus that decant that we can't get to, can we go ahead and jump over and hit those three?
**Colbyhjrllc**: I think so.
**Colbyhjrllc**: I think what, What I've stressed to Ulta is let's see how Wednesday goes Tuesday, and we'll see how quick we're moving.
**Colbyhjrllc**: And I know you guys are good at what you do, so I'm hoping you move quick.
**Colbyhjrllc**: I, I.
**Speaker 2**: And they just have a fire drill every night from 6 to 6, and then we don't have to worry about them being there.
**Colbyhjrllc**: That'd be so nice.
**Speaker 2**: I'll tell you what, I'll even provide the coffee, the sleeping powder, and the donuts.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Yeah, if you can convince them of that, that's fine.
**Colbyhjrllc**: But every, Every night, they shut down, they lose millions and millions of dollars.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, we know.
**Speaker 2**: We.
**Crusin**: We see them videos on Tick Tock of them shape shifting every night.
**Crusin**: We know where it's going.
**Colbyhjrllc**: So funny.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Shape shifting?
**Colbyhjrllc**: I haven't heard it called that.
**Crusin**: Nate, you haven't seen those videos we're talking about.
**Crusin**: Don't let them know we can shape shift.
**Crusin**: And it's the way then they, they change.
**Colbyhjrllc**: I thought you were talking about people put so much makeup on, they change.
**Speaker 2**: The way they look.
**Speaker 2**: That's what he's talking about.
**Crusin**: They look like.
**Crusin**: And then they turn into supermodels.
**Speaker 2**: And then when you go out to the club and the lights are down.
**Colbyhjrllc**: It'S dudes turning into chicks.
**Speaker 2**: Oh, my word.
**Crusin**: That's.
**Crusin**: It's gotten even worse.
**Colbyhjrllc**: It's way worse.
**Crusin**: That's why I keep my ass at the house, man.
**Speaker 2**: At least you know what you got there.
**Crusin**: Exactly.
**Colbyhjrllc**: And you won't run into too much of that in Dallas, right?
**Speaker 2**: No, you just can't speak.
**Speaker 2**: You can't speak English to anybody in.
**Crusin**: Dallas, but that's right, the majority of the workforce there.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, we.
**Colbyhjrllc**: So if I label this drawing for you guys, like, does this spreadsheet kind of make sense?
**Speaker 2**: Yes, yes.
**Crusin**: Okay.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, no, that, that makes sense.
**Speaker 2**: I just didn't.
**Speaker 2**: I was just curious, you know, if we got done, you know, if they got done on that platform in two days, you know, I just.
**Speaker 2**: It'd be nice.
**Speaker 2**: I mean, they may want a day off here and there anyway, so if they finish up early, it may be Nice to everybody take a night off.
**Speaker 2**: Anyway, so I got two weeks in.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Here, Colby and I have it planned.
**Colbyhjrllc**: So I.
**Colbyhjrllc**: No, if you finish quicker, like, I.
**Colbyhjrllc**: I'm just.
**Colbyhjrllc**: I'm telling you, like, Ulta may say no.
**Colbyhjrllc**: And that's why I have two weeks planned and decan area on the weekends.
**Colbyhjrllc**: And if.
**Colbyhjrllc**: If they allow us to hop over, they may, like, we may kick butt and be like, this is gonna go really quick.
**Colbyhjrllc**: But we won't know until we get up in a lift on.
**Colbyhjrllc**: On Monday, Tuesday, start getting our scaffolding and ready for that.
**Colbyhjrllc**: I don't know how long.
**Colbyhjrllc**: I mean, I think it's gonna take you a while to set up scaffolding over demod or over the.
**Colbyhjrllc**: The girder over the replan.
**Speaker 2**: We may throw that.
**Speaker 2**: That.
**Speaker 2**: We could throw it Monday night, right, if we wanted to.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Yeah, if you wanted to start.
**Crusin**: We can leave it up.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: The hanging scaffold, we can.
**Speaker 2**: We should be able to.
**Speaker 2**: I don't want to leave any material up.
**Speaker 2**: That's one thing that we won't leave up is anything goes up, gets welded or at least tacked.
**Colbyhjrllc**: I agree.
**Speaker 2**: I don't want anything.
**Speaker 2**: Any chance of anything falling that way.
**Speaker 2**: You know, the hanging scaffold, as long as it's.
**Speaker 2**: Well, so we'll.
**Speaker 2**: We'll look at the areas, but that.
**Speaker 2**: That stays pretty secure.
**Speaker 2**: That's.
**Speaker 2**: I'm not necessarily worried about the hanging scaffold like I am the material, but material we just don't leave hanging on active plants.
**Speaker 2**: It gets at least tacked up, and some of those is like the webs.
**Speaker 2**: By the time you tack them, you might as well weld them.
**Speaker 2**: So a lot of that stuff will put up as we.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Okay, so we'll plan on.
**Colbyhjrllc**: On having some guys there then Monday night for discovery, right?
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, no, we'll get.
**Speaker 2**: Most of the crew will probably be there Monday night.
**Speaker 2**: I'm just.
**Speaker 2**: Just kind of a heads up.
**Speaker 2**: They probably.
**Speaker 2**: We've got a couple.
**Speaker 2**: One or two of our welders.
**Speaker 2**: We may not have them come in necessarily, but all the ground guys and stuff that way.
**Speaker 2**: So at least everybody knows which game plans going for that side of it is.
**Speaker 2**: But I just.
**Speaker 2**: The.
**Speaker 2**: The.
**Speaker 2**: There's two older guys and they got a little ways to travel, so.
**Speaker 2**: And I don't mean it wrong, but I'm.
**Speaker 2**: We'll.
**Speaker 2**: We'll see.
**Speaker 2**: We'll.
**Speaker 2**: We'll give them the option.
**Speaker 2**: But I know they're pretty big on going to church and stuff with their families and stuff too, so some of them have Sunday Night service or, you know, we have a Sunday night service.
**Speaker 2**: Some of them will have it.
**Speaker 2**: You know, some of them do Easter during the day and lunch.
**Speaker 2**: Like I said, I just don't want to.
**Speaker 2**: I don't want to mess up their family time there before they head out.
**Speaker 2**: So they may, you know, they may be pulling in.
**Speaker 2**: They'll probably be pulling in that evening and, you know, stay until 10, 12 o'clock is not going to be an issue.
**Speaker 2**: But stay until 6 o'clock in the morning.
**Speaker 2**: They may not.
**Speaker 2**: Might not do that.
**Speaker 2**: But for the most part, most of the guys will be okay with, with getting set up and getting at least eyes on there and a game plan and, and hopefully we can get the scaffold and stuff set up at least.
**Speaker 2**: And, you know, not necessarily starting welding, but get a lot of stuff prepped and then.
**Speaker 2**: And then make sure we've got everything.
**Speaker 2**: We don't need to pick up more extension cords or anything like that either.
**Colbyhjrllc**: And you.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Are you bringing all your lifts and.
**Crusin**: Boom.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Lifts and stuff?
**Colbyhjrllc**: Are you getting that delivered on.
**Colbyhjrllc**: On Monday, you think?
**Speaker 2**: Monday.
**Speaker 2**: They'll get all that stuff delivered Monday.
**Speaker 2**: We'll have it there for Monday night.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Just.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Just need someone there to receive it.
**Colbyhjrllc**: And if you need me to be there, I can, Colby.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Like, I'll fly out at some point.
**Speaker 2**: Monday and then let me know what your guys's schedule is going to be, and then we can try to coordinate it with our rental company if we need to.
**Speaker 2**: And one of us will.
**Speaker 2**: One of us will fly out there before, and we can do that, too.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Well, either way, if we're meeting at 6, we're going to fly out there, you know, get like an afternoon delivery.
**Crusin**: Yeah.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Or something.
**Speaker 2**: That's what.
**Speaker 2**: Oh.
**Speaker 2**: So I know we said propane welders.
**Speaker 2**: Can we run propane lifts?
**Colbyhjrllc**: Yes.
**Speaker 2**: All right.
**Speaker 2**: And do you know, this is the other question, like, as far as which we'll find out when we get there, too.
**Speaker 2**: But, you know, if there's outlets close as far as like, plugging these fans and stuff in.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Ish.
**Speaker 2**: Ish.
**Speaker 2**: We talking 500 footage or we're talking close?
**Colbyhjrllc**: Ish.
**Speaker 2**: Okay.
**Colbyhjrllc**: We had, we had a generator in there, a propane generator.
**Colbyhjrllc**: I think they were using it to power the welders too, or something.
**Crusin**: I.
**Crusin**: I don't remember.
**Colbyhjrllc**: I mean, some of these welders have plugs on them, don't they?
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, they do.
**Speaker 2**: Some of them do.
**Speaker 2**: They're gonna.
**Speaker 2**: That.
**Speaker 2**: So if you run too much propane, though, they're gonna start fussing about the fumes on that too.
**Speaker 2**: So anything we can do to try to relieve from having to run, especially on our blowers and stuff that have to run constant.
**Speaker 2**: If we can keep from having to run them off, any kind of propane powered piece of equipment would be great.
**Speaker 2**: We got that.
**Speaker 2**: We got that dual fuel on your trailer too.
**Speaker 2**: That's basically a zero emissions.
**Speaker 2**: Just have to make sure we got the propane hose and the tank sitting on it.
**Crusin**: All right.
**Speaker 2**: So we'll bring it.
**Speaker 2**: We've got a.
**Speaker 2**: We've got a pretty decent sized generator we can run stuff off of.
**Speaker 2**: But it's.
**Speaker 2**: It.
**Speaker 2**: It runs propane or gas.
**Speaker 2**: So we'll.
**Speaker 2**: We'll make sure it's there with all the fittings and stuff for it, so.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Okay.
**Speaker 2**: But I don't know.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Listen.
**Speaker 2**: No, you're good.
**Colbyhjrllc**: The one thing I will need too from you is a list of names.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Colby.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Of who all is going to be on site so we can give it to security.
**Speaker 2**: Okay.
**Speaker 2**: They have to pass background check.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Nah, nah, you'll be all right.
**Colbyhjrllc**: They will have to pass a drug test.
**Speaker 2**: If something happens though, that's fine.
**Speaker 2**: They don't pass it.
**Speaker 2**: We don't pray them.
**Speaker 2**: I mean, that's.
**Speaker 2**: That's how it works, right?
**Speaker 2**: No, I'm.
**Speaker 2**: I'm good.
**Colbyhjrllc**: I learned that we had a fire last time and we had to have everybody drug tests.
**Colbyhjrllc**: At least everyone that was involved.
**Colbyhjrllc**: So.
**Speaker 2**: Fires are not good.
**Colbyhjrllc**: No.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Well, they caught a.
**Colbyhjrllc**: The bottom of the conveyor.
**Colbyhjrllc**: There's that plastic like webbing.
**Colbyhjrllc**: They caught that on fire.
**Colbyhjrllc**: But we had a guy with 10 seconds.
**Colbyhjrllc**: There was an extinguisher on it.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Colbyhjrllc**: And we set us back a week and incident reports and it made my life very hard.
**Colbyhjrllc**: So let's just not do that.
**Speaker 2**: That's not.
**Speaker 2**: I'd rather not either.
**Speaker 2**: Doesn't look like Canada would either.
**Colbyhjrllc**: No, he wouldn't.
**Speaker 2**: All right, so.
**Speaker 2**: Welding rod.
**Speaker 2**: So how far into submittals you want?
**Speaker 2**: I mean, do you want me to send you propane submittals and all that kind of stuff too?
**Colbyhjrllc**: Okay, equipment list with model numbers and whatever.
**Colbyhjrllc**: We're The.
**Colbyhjrllc**: The rod we're using.
**Speaker 2**: Equipment scrubber.
**Colbyhjrllc**: That's our.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Our steel.
**Colbyhjrllc**: You know, our.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Our round rod and then what.
**Colbyhjrllc**: I don't know what you call it, but yeah, the stuff you, you burn to make the.
**Speaker 2**: No, it's.
**Speaker 2**: Welding is.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Welding rod.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: Well, it's.
**Speaker 2**: Electrodes is the.
**Speaker 2**: Is whenever you pull it up, it'll be like a Lincoln 7018 electrode is what it'll be listed as.
**Speaker 2**: But I'll Send all that over to you.
**Speaker 2**: We've got all that.
**Speaker 2**: That's not a problem.
**Speaker 2**: I didn't know if you needed, like, a full, you know, the full SDS sheets for everything that's going to be on site, or if we're just basically doing.
**Speaker 2**: You're just looking to submit to them, say, hey, this is what they're going to have their type.
**Speaker 2**: Deal.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Yeah, here's what I.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Let me see here.
**Colbyhjrllc**: It's from Lincoln Electric.
**Colbyhjrllc**: It's what?
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, if you just Type S types, Excalibur 7018sDs will be what I'm going to send you.
**Speaker 2**: I can actually email it to you now.
**Speaker 2**: We've got it on the computer.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Here's what I sent them last time.
**Speaker 2**: Same thing.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, that's the same thing.
**Colbyhjrllc**: I don't even know if they read it, Colby.
**Colbyhjrllc**: But we gotta send it.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, I don't.
**Speaker 2**: But it's in our books.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Okay.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Any other questions?
**Colbyhjrllc**: I'll get this cleaned up and typed up right here.
**Colbyhjrllc**: So, you know, the areas with the schedule, the SOPs, and then I.
**Colbyhjrllc**: I.
**Speaker 2**: Don'T see anything that.
**Speaker 2**: I mean, I don't see anything that's.
**Speaker 2**: That I think we're gonna have issues with.
**Speaker 2**: I just.
**Speaker 2**: I usually just.
**Speaker 2**: Like I said, I usually just ask.
**Speaker 2**: If we run ahead, if it's an issue.
**Speaker 2**: If it.
**Speaker 2**: If it turns into an issue, then the guys get a couple nights off, then that's good, too.
**Speaker 2**: So how.
**Speaker 2**: You know, we will.
**Colbyhjrllc**: We'll.
**Speaker 2**: We'll do what best we can.
**Speaker 2**: Keep up the schedule and try to beat it and make sure everybody leaves without any issues and nothing's harmed.
**Speaker 2**: So will there be people working directly underneath us or just products running under us?
**Colbyhjrllc**: It'll be product.
**Colbyhjrllc**: No, I mean, that's why the dean area we got to do.
**Speaker 2**: Okay.
**Speaker 2**: I'm just asking because we've had.
**Speaker 2**: We've had, like, depending where.
**Speaker 2**: And I haven't been there.
**Speaker 2**: Nate's been there, but that's.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: Some of the times PED likes, hey, we got these guys operating underneath you.
**Speaker 2**: And that doesn't.
**Speaker 2**: Like.
**Speaker 2**: No matter what you do, you can't.
**Crusin**: Ever keep them happy.
**Crusin**: On that schedule is we shouldn't have product running under us either, right?
**Speaker 2**: No, they'll probably still.
**Speaker 2**: They'll have the belt.
**Speaker 2**: The belts running.
**Speaker 2**: Conveyors are still going to be running is what they're wanting to do.
**Speaker 2**: Right.
**Colbyhjrllc**: Do you guys WI fi out?
**Crusin**: They're back now.
**Speaker 2**: You there, WI fi?
**Crusin**: Nope.
**Crusin**: I would assume that the conveyors may be running underneath you.
**Crusin**: Yeah, the stuff where I was Looking when I was there was what y'all were putting up it.
**Crusin**: None of that was operational yet.
**Crusin**: The only place that was operational was on that.
**Crusin**: On that rack.
**Crusin**: The rackings there, where that girder is, we have to work on right up now.
**Speaker 2**: The new stuff up?
**Crusin**: No, nothing's running.
**Speaker 2**: It's up though.
**Crusin**: Yes.
**Crusin**: Not though.
**Crusin**: Not the stuff hanging that we're reinforcing for the.
**Crusin**: There's a platform, a mezzanine that has new conveyors on it.
**Crusin**: Right.
**Speaker 2**: Can you take them off so we got more workspace, right?
**Speaker 2**: Oh, I don't see that as a problem.
**Speaker 2**: I mean, we'll.
**Speaker 2**: We'll make it work.
**Speaker 2**: We got.
**Speaker 2**: We got some baker scaffold, we've got some hanging scaffold.
**Speaker 2**: Hanging scaffold's pretty neat.
**Speaker 2**: You'll have to go up there with the guys.
**Speaker 2**: It's like a rope bridge.
**Speaker 2**: Swinging rope bridge, if you like that type of thing.
**Crusin**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: Until it comes loose.
**Crusin**: Right.
**Crusin**: Then you're hanging.
**Speaker 2**: But now they.
**Speaker 2**: They lock in pretty well.
**Speaker 2**: We've got a.
**Speaker 2**: We went through some.
**Speaker 2**: Over the years, we went.
**Speaker 2**: We've used that stuff a lot and it saved our butts a lot.
**Speaker 2**: And we've put it.
**Speaker 2**: We've put it in places people like, you can't use us.
**Speaker 2**: Like.
**Speaker 2**: Well, you tell us how else we're getting up there.
**Crusin**: Right.
**Crusin**: Right.
**Crusin**: Yeah.
**Crusin**: Probably saves a lot of time.
**Speaker 2**: It does.
**Speaker 2**: Sometimes it can be a pain in the butt to put up, but it definitely makes a.
**Speaker 2**: Makes a difference.
**Crusin**: Yeah.
**Colbyhjrllc**: So.
**Crusin**: Okay.
**Crusin**: Yeah.
**Crusin**: I don't know if he'll be coming back anytime soon if his WI fi is out.
**Crusin**: You guys got any other.
**Crusin**: Go ahead.
**Speaker 2**: I think I was gonna say, I think we're good.
**Crusin**: Okay.
**Speaker 2**: You know, we'll be there.
**Speaker 2**: Be there Monday night and then, you know, get to where we can.
**Speaker 2**: Like I said, I don't.
**Speaker 2**: I.
**Speaker 2**: I doubt.
**Speaker 2**: Just depending on how everybody feels a doubt, sparks really fly.
**Speaker 2**: But it doesn't look like we're probably.
**Speaker 2**: Probably dropping sparks anyway.
**Speaker 2**: But the big thing is it's going to be getting everybody accustomed to what we got to get.
**Speaker 2**: Go through there and then do it that way.
**Speaker 2**: And then, you know, swapping over to night shift isn't always fun either, so.
**Crusin**: No, it's not.
**Crusin**: Takes you a couple days to get used to.
**Speaker 2**: About time you get done with the job is usually when you get used to it.
**Crusin**: Exactly.
**Crusin**: And you're all.
**Crusin**: All messed up.
**Speaker 2**: Then you get home and everybody's want to know why you're still up at 4 o'clock in the morning.
**Crusin**: I think you're up to no good.
**Speaker 2**: Oh, AJ's trying to call me.
**Speaker 2**: Hold on.
**Speaker 2**: Hey, bud.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, he lost his WI fi.
**Speaker 2**: Okay, so I think we're good.
**Speaker 2**: Unless you got something else.
**Crusin**: Nope.
**Crusin**: All set.
**Crusin**: The only other thing.
**Crusin**: Let's just figure out when you got your equipment coming.
**Crusin**: I got no problem getting there early if need be, so just let us know and we'll go from there.
**Speaker 2**: What's your phone number?
**Speaker 2**: I don't have yours.
**Crusin**: 727.
**Crusin**: 599.
**Crusin**: 4832.
**Speaker 2**: Is that Las Vegas?
**Crusin**: Florida.
**Speaker 2**: Florida.
**Speaker 2**: 7.
**Speaker 2**: 727.
**Speaker 2**: Why was I thinking that's a Nevada?
**Crusin**: No, Florida.
**Speaker 2**: So you're flying from Florida?
**Crusin**: Yep.
**Speaker 2**: Okay.
**Speaker 2**: You guys travel all over?
**Crusin**: Yeah, that's.
**Crusin**: That's what it seems to be that we're getting into all over the country.
**Speaker 2**: We don't ever get stuff at home, and if we do, it's always bad.
**Speaker 2**: I don't know why.
**Speaker 2**: But if the guys can go home at night, it turns out bad, right?
**Speaker 2**: You can ask.
**Speaker 2**: Night.
**Speaker 2**: I'm dead serious that it's got to be three hours from the house for the job to run halfway smooth.
**Crusin**: What the hell?
**Speaker 2**: Everything with everything within an hour, hour and a half.
**Speaker 2**: It usually goes to crap on us, but.
**Crusin**: Yep.
**Crusin**: Steer away from it.
**Crusin**: Hu.
**Speaker 2**: You know you can't bid it high enough because he won't cover it.
**Crusin**: Right.
**Speaker 2**: But no, we'll.
**Speaker 2**: We'll see you Monday night, and I'll let you know on the equipment and stuff.
**Speaker 2**: We'll see if we can get worked out and go from there.
**Crusin**: Perfect.
**Crusin**: Yeah, Go ahead.
**Speaker 2**: Go ahead.
**Speaker 2**: Go ahead.
**Speaker 2**: Sorry.
**Crusin**: I was gonna say, if you wanted to shoot me a text that way.
**Crusin**: I got you.
**Crusin**: And I'll save you in my phone.
**Speaker 2**: I will do it.
**Speaker 2**: Do you know where y'all are staying yet?
**Crusin**: I stay at this Grand Pierre epic Center Place.
**Crusin**: AJ stayed there once.
**Crusin**: It's about 10 minutes from the.
**Crusin**: From the job site.
**Crusin**: They got a couple restaurants on site, so kind of works out.
**Crusin**: You ain't got to go too far.
**Crusin**: And then it's probably 15.
**Crusin**: 15 minutes from the Dallas airport.
**Crusin**: Fort Worth.
**Speaker 2**: Okay.
**Crusin**: It's kind of centrally located between the two.
**Speaker 2**: All right, sounds good.
**Speaker 2**: Well, I will shoot you checked here in a minute with our information.
**Crusin**: Perfect.
**Crusin**: Appreciate it, sir.
**Speaker 2**: Not a problem.
**Speaker 2**: Nice meeting you.
**Crusin**: Nice meeting you, too.
**Crusin**: Bye.
