## Transcript

**AJ Taylor:**
A long time. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
So. 

**Shan Clevenger:**
Good morning. 

**AJ Taylor:**
Hey, Sean. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Morning, A.J. that's like one of those things. Tell me you're from Indiana without telling me you're from Indiana. Man, we sure needed that rain. 

**Shan Clevenger:**
Did you guys get a good rain last night? 

**AJ Taylor:**
It's raining right now. 

**Shan Clevenger:**
Oh, it is. Oh, good for you. Yeah, we're getting a little dry here ourselves. We haven't seen anything for probably over a week and doesn't look like anything. 

**Shan Clevenger:**
For the coming week either. 

**Candon Rusin:**
So it's good. 

**AJ Taylor:**
It's gonna warm up a little bit for Labor Day, but maybe a little rain next week. Good. We got that concrete poured. 

**Shan Clevenger:**
Yes, Good deal. 

**AJ Taylor:**
So, Sean, I don't have, for some reason my, and share my screen here. My, my meeting notes aren't loading, but I'm going to pull up the, the plans here in the schedule. So right now, Canon, if you want to give us just some side updates. 

**Candon Rusin:**
Yeah, okay. So yesterday we poured the entryway sidewalk. So that's complete. We're going to be pouring a little 8 inch lift for the columns here. Well, we'll see today. We should be able to pour them, just cover them with some plastic, which will allow us to frame out that front entryway canopy area. Yesterday we completed the main area ceiling grid. Today they're going to be finishing up the two bathrooms in the back. Then we also have the electricians on site this morning pulling some more home runs to the center of the, of the main area there. 

**AJ Taylor:**
So, Sean, I can't remember if you were on our call with FedEx. I think Glendon was. 

**Glendon Griesbaum:**
I missed that call. 

**AJ Taylor:**
I got. Okay, I got it mixed up opposite. So we did confirm, especially after reading that, that lease that we are to provide all the power which we, we included for. But I was, I was trying to see where they were thinking to save you guys a little money, but ends up we do have to do all that. So. Word. 

**Shan Clevenger:**
Well, A.J. i have to agree with you. I was going to look back at my notes. I'm pretty sure at one point they had said, no, you know what, we'll go ahead and take care of that. But what, I mean, it is what it is. And you're right, it's in our agreement. But I thought they had just said, no, we'll, we'll throw those in. 

**AJ Taylor:**
They, they definitely did say that they would want their. Or we're going to have their electricians do it. So I'm not sure in the lease negotiations how all that worked out. I've never done one of these FedExes before. I do know that they, their plans sometimes are, are odd because they like spell out what the landlord's supposed to do and what, what their GC is supposed to do. But sometimes they have dots on both of them. And anyway, we got that sorted out. I was able to work with James yesterday or Tuesday. And so our electricians are back there pulling all those home runs. And then what. What's interesting, and I'm waiting for them to get back to me is we're gonna have to figure out scheduling because they have to come in and do their finishes and then we have to run conduits for their, their casework and for some of their, their fixtures. So I, I don't believe I'll be able to actually close out our permit until they're done. So I'm working through to see what, what exactly they want to do. Do they want us to run that conduit on the ground before they're flooring? Which would make zero sense. Let me see if I can't pull up this permit set for you. Here we go. So what I'm referring to is this right here, if you can see my screen. This calls for conduit running on the ground, but they have to put their flooring in. So what we'll do is we'll pull a power pole from. That's what this number four is from the ceiling. We have a junction box up there. And then we will run that for them to plug in all of their, their production equipment. 

**Shan Clevenger:**
Okay. 

**AJ Taylor:**
So that's, that's a little. 

**Shan Clevenger:**
Kind of. 

**AJ Taylor:**
Gap, I think, in the schedule. Now the ball's in their court to let me know what they want to do, but I'm working with them through that. So as far as scheduling goes though, we're right on, you know, we're right on par with that interior. For them to be able to get in there and do their thing, I would say here in the next couple weeks. And then, you know, critical path wise, the biggest thing is getting this, this masonry done. So because of the added lintels, we have to have our lintels installed before we can go in and secure all of our storefront and all of our windows. And then we'll have to finish those. We're going to front set our windows so they're in the brick. And then we still have 8 inches of precast we have to cover. So we're gonna have to frame those out and then finish our drywall to the windows. So that'll be some catch up that we'll do here probably in Late September to try and work towards this 10, 7 finish date. 

**Shan Clevenger:**
Okay. Okay, that's great. 

**AJ Taylor:**
So obviously no work will be happening on Monday. Monday's Labor Day. And I, I know you saw my emails yesterday. I sent You Pay app 3. 

**Shan Clevenger:**
Yes. 

**AJ Taylor:**
And then did you get my email with our, with our proper address confirming that? 

**Shan Clevenger:**
Yes, I did. I did. 

**Shan Clevenger:**
So I'm at least. Yeah, you let me know at what point you wanted us to reissue a check. But I just know mail's just been so slow. You know, we've got stores in Champaign that sometimes it's ridiculous how long it takes us to get mail from there. Okay, so Carmel's even further. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
What did. When did you guys mail out the checks? 

**Shan Clevenger:**
August 5th. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
You mailed out the 30,000 $1? 

**Shan Clevenger:**
Yes. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Okay then. Yeah, I would say it hasn't showed up yet. So we'll go. You know, I'd say let's go ahead and reissue the 30,000. And then have you already issued the other one whatever. The three something, whatever's due this tomorrow. 

**Shan Clevenger:**
We have issued. So we issued Pay app. I'm sorry, it was more than 30,000. It was pay app 1 and 2 was paid out on August 5th and they were paid out as one check. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Okay, then, yeah, go ahead. And if you would please go ahead and reissue that. And if, if you guys are having issues with mail, we can go ahead and we can do a FedEx whatever that thing is and send it to you if that, if that would work. 

**Shan Clevenger:**
Let's. Well, we can. We'll FedEx it to you. Let's do that. 

**Shan Clevenger:**
Okay. 

**Shan Clevenger:**
Or we'll ups it to you. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah. 

**Shan Clevenger:**
Is your address the same then obviously for that. 

**AJ Taylor:**
Okay, yeah, we'll do that. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Sweet one. 

**AJ Taylor:**
Sean, I'm here in Indy. You just let me know when you guys do it. 

**Shan Clevenger:**
Okay. 

**Shan Clevenger:**
And I'll send you the tractor. 

**AJ Taylor:**
I'm at the office. Perfect. 

**Shan Clevenger:**
Yeah, I'll send you the tracking number. 

**AJ Taylor:**
That'd be great. And then did you see as well, I issued those change orders that show the pull from contingency we talked about. Yes, it's a zero. It's a zero dollar change order. But it's, it's so on that billing you'll be able to see I billed. I think it was 5,600 out of contingency. Right. To cover that. But then it zeros out at the bottom. That's how you can, how you can read that. And then the only one we have hanging out there is, is the permit fees which came out to about $2,075. I know we're going to see here later this month where we end up with that contingency to see what we can pull from. I know you don't want to have to go ask for more money, so. 

**Shan Clevenger:**
We'Ll. 

**AJ Taylor:**
We'll see how that shakes out. I don't foresee any. Anything coming up here in the future. I think we're. We're through all that for the most part. 

**Shan Clevenger:**
Okay. 

**AJ Taylor:**
So as far as budget goes, we're looking good. And then the last thing I just wanted to update you on, you may be seeing something from the gas company that I'll need an owner to sign. This is for our new meter that we're going to be installing. So right now you have one service. What the gas company will do is they'll basically modify that meter so it shows two. Two services. And we'll be able to then attach our gas piping for FedEx. And then what I usually do is I'll set it up in my name. Right. Or we can set up in your name. And then you need to come November 1st, whenever that lease kicks in, FedEx will have to then basically transfer the service into their name, whoever does the billing for them. Okay. 

**Shan Clevenger:**
Okay. Okay. 

**AJ Taylor:**
So I'll give you some more detail on that when the time comes. 

**Shan Clevenger:**
Okay. 

**AJ Taylor:**
Alrighty. 

**Shan Clevenger:**
Sounds good. 

**AJ Taylor:**
That's all I had to cover on my end. Any questions for me? Linden? 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Did you get that note that AJ Sent about linking up with. You know, I guess it would be Richard Jr. Or Richard and myself. 

**Glendon Griesbaum:**
Yeah, I haven't got a chance to talk to him about it yet, but when I get a chance to talk to him about it, then I'll let you guys know. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Perfect. I know. Yeah. 

**AJ Taylor:**
If you. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
From my understanding, you guys have a couple spots that you're. You're looking at and aren't too happy with your current design builder. 

**Glendon Griesbaum:**
I think for the most part, it's been a good experience. And I think Rich Said told aj, you know, he. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
He. 

**Glendon Griesbaum:**
He's happy with the work they've done, but I know we're always looking for different builders, different options, and. And so I definitely want to. Want to try to keep a relationship with you guys. And if we have the opportunity for you guys to look at some projects for us, then we'll pass those along. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Sounds good. 

**AJ Taylor:**
And as things come up, Glendon, like I said when we were chatting, just obviously pick my brain, pick our brain. We're here to help, so appreciate that. 

**Shan Clevenger:**
Mmhmm. Very much so. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Thanks, everybody. Have a great Labor Day weekend. 

**Candon Rusin:**
Yep. 

**AJ Taylor:**
All right. 

**Shan Clevenger:**
Thank you. 

**AJ Taylor:**
See you. 

**Shan Clevenger:**
Bye.
