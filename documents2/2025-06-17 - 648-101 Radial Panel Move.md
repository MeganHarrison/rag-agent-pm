## Transcript
**Ahuettl**: Joining Alex will be tag teaming it.
**Ahuettl**: We have another guy flying in from Dallas who's on a project that's wrapping up and he'll be here tomorrow, so.
**Ataylor**: Okay, great.
**Ataylor**: Do we have everyone?
**Ahuettl**: Obviously, just give it a couple minutes and then.
**Ahuettl**: All right.
**Ahuettl**: I'm assuming some guys from demos show up here.
**Ataylor**: Okay, so can you guys, can you explain the relationship between you guys and team?
**Ahuettl**: Yeah.
**Ahuettl**: So we're.
**Ahuettl**: We're a general contractor.
**Ahuettl**: We do pretty much the majority of radial projects across the nation.
**Ahuettl**: We're based.
**Ahuettl**: We're based out of Indianapolis and then, you know, we have an office in Tampa Bay as well.
**Ahuettl**: So we've done many, many projects with radial, especially with J.P.
**Ahuettl**: so yeah, that's where we fit in and we're kind of helping reel everything in and coordinate and you know, we'll be doing all the electrical drops and then all of the construction associated with adding the 30 dock doors and levelers and anything else that that pops up.
**Ahuettl**: So it's my understanding.
**Ahuettl**: So you guys are in charge of the conveyance, correct, Matt?
**Ataylor**: We are, yeah.
**Ahuettl**: Okay, cool.
**Ataylor**: So radio was kind of an existing customer.
**Ataylor**: They contacted us, wanted to move some conveyor around and stuff, even though it's a system that we didn't put in.
**Ataylor**: So that's kind of how we got involved.
**Ahuettl**: Okay, nice.
**Ataylor**: So do you guys do a lot of conveyor jobs around Minneapolis area?
**Ataylor**: We're always looking for electricians.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah.
**Ahuettl**: I mean a lot of the jobs I've been on, it really just, you know, we're usually just running the house power to the con, the control panels.
**Ahuettl**: Right.
**Ahuettl**: As far as, as far as the actual.
**Ahuettl**: I mean, I would assume you guys are going to be moving this control panel for us or is that, is that going to be in our scope?
**Ahuettl**: I guess I gotta look like physically.
**Ataylor**: Moving it with a, with a forklift.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So this, the scope was to get the MCP moved.
**Bclymer**: Was going to be.
**Bclymer**: The original plan was that our guy, like the electricians would go and start pulling wire back out of the conduit and pull it back and, and we make that just those could disconnections.
**Bclymer**: Then we would.
**Bclymer**: Could physically help move the panel because we were going to have a forklift on site this whole sk.
**Bclymer**: But radio has been.
**Bclymer**: That'll be part of the discussion of the day because it may not be perfect because radio's been pushing it back and forth like 20.
**Bclymer**: Everything was lined up for these certain weeks.
**Bclymer**: We were going to do it and they were just like, we need it faster, we need it now, we need it Now.
**Bclymer**: And so.
**Bclymer**: So then the idea is to move the panel, and then we'd have an engineer on site to help with.
**Bclymer**: With doing that and supervising and getting everything going again, but to move the panel.
**Bclymer**: And then all those wires we pulled out of the conduit to pull them back into the panel and re.
**Bclymer**: Terminate them, you know?
**Ahuettl**: Okay, so.
**Bclymer**: So we'll.
**Ahuettl**: We'll remove the wire for you guys, and then we'll coordinate getting it moved, and then we'll terminate it back into the mcp once that gets a location determined.
**Bclymer**: Yes, that's the general idea.
**Bclymer**: I wasn't sure if we had all the people we needed to start with the.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah.
**Ahuettl**: Okay, we got everybody here.
**Ataylor**: Well, Donnie, let's go ahead and start from the top and pull up the drawing just to make sure everyone's familiar.
**Ataylor**: Let's talk about what we've already done and kind of talk about some possible family locations, too.
**Bclymer**: All right, so let's see.
**Bclymer**: I will share our drawing.
**Bclymer**: So the existing system has this line over here that feeds all the way across to the sorter.
**Bclymer**: The MCP is right there.
**Bclymer**: This MCP also controls this little sleepies line.
**Bclymer**: I'll get to this one later.
**Bclymer**: An existing thing is it feeds this little sleeping sign.
**Bclymer**: What we ended up already having to do, and this is already different from the scope we had originally sent to Dean and to Leto is.
**Bclymer**: Well, the first thing they want us to do is start taking this conveyor out, because they're clearing this whole Geek plus area, as you all know, to make room for Amazon.
**Bclymer**: And so we had a weekend where Dean was going to come out and disconnect the electrical that fed all this conveyor.
**Bclymer**: That way we could start demoing it.
**Bclymer**: That was supposed to happen this coming weekend.
**Bclymer**: It happened instead last week because they.
**Bclymer**: They literally said, like, hey, can y' all come out immediately and start clearing it out?
**Bclymer**: We pulled.
**Bclymer**: We had a lot of people on the field, so I ended up going myself, which is, you know, outside my norm, but we needed to get it done.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, we didn't make introduction before, but I'm Donnie Wirsch.
**Bclymer**: I'm the director of electrical and controls engineering for ssi.
**Bclymer**: Matt's the project manager on this, and Eric is the project engineer on it.
**Bclymer**: So Eric was still in another project, so I had to run out and did it.
**Bclymer**: So we disconnected all that wiring from here that powered all this conveyor and actually already took a lot of this conveyor out all the way up to here and started setting it here to be what, a new line Was.
**Ataylor**: The.
**Bclymer**: Remaining part of the demo is, well, there's still this panel here that's gonna.
**Bclymer**: With conduit running all the way over around here and going to this existing little sleepies line.
**Bclymer**: Well, that's in.
**Bclymer**: That's in the Amazon area now.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: So the idea is to take.
**Bclymer**: To take the panel and move it.
**Bclymer**: Original plan was just to move it to, like, you know, like I said, to have all this conduit coming to the panel, which just put the NCP like, in this area, and it would just connect into that existing conduit and feed little sleepies.
**Bclymer**: Well, that leaves it in the Amazon area.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: So that doesn't work.
**Bclymer**: And it leaves it in a forklift dial.
**Bclymer**: So that's when they said, well, can we put it over in this area?
**Bclymer**: And so that's already a chain.
**Bclymer**: Another change to the pricing we'd received before.
**Bclymer**: So I know y' all are on site to be able to see this.
**Bclymer**: They sent me a video.
**Bclymer**: You know, this conduit all comes and makes, like, where it turns and makes a 45 degree, then another 45 degree to make it around this curve.
**Bclymer**: So the question is, or just the panel move portion, where could we put it?
**Bclymer**: Here?
**Bclymer**: You know, I said, I.
**Bclymer**: So could you just have all these conduits run straight to the panel?
**Bclymer**: Well, the problem is there's a leg right there, a single leg that goes down.
**Bclymer**: So all this conduit would kind of run through the leg.
**Bclymer**: So then would you need to, you know, take the curve off and then rework this or have it curved the other way?
**Bclymer**: That's where y' all being on site.
**Bclymer**: So like I said, they just want it somewhere in this area where it's out of the way and won't get out in people aisles or forklifts aisles or any of that other stuff.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Ahuettl**: Right, okay, so that's.
**Bclymer**: That's good.
**Ahuettl**: Go ahead.
**Bclymer**: No, no, no, you say that.
**Ahuettl**: That's easy enough.
**Ahuettl**: So tomorrow, you know, we have the bulk of our electricians showing up tomorrow, and that's something.
**Ahuettl**: And I know who.
**Ahuettl**: Who have you been dealing with?
**Ahuettl**: Who's been your point of contact from a radial standpoint?
**Ahuettl**: Because you guys.
**Ahuettl**: You guys aren't.
**Ataylor**: Alicia.
**Ahuettl**: Contracting with us.
**Ahuettl**: You're contracting with.
**Ahuettl**: With radio.
**Ahuettl**: Yes, correct.
**Ahuettl**: So, yeah, we're helping organize it all, though, so.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I know.
**Bclymer**: And so, yeah, we have POS from.
**Bclymer**: From radio, directly from.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: And then with money to hire.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, it's a subcontractor, so.
**Ahuettl**: Okay.
**Ahuettl**: Have you been talking with JP or who has your Radio point of contact been Alicia.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah, Alicia has been.
**Ahuettl**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: And then she was sort of dragged into it.
**Ataylor**: It's not really her role, I don't think.
**Ahuettl**: Right.
**Ahuettl**: Well, I.
**Ahuettl**: Tomorrow, you know, JP is going to be on site tomorrow, and so we'll be doing a lot of walking around, and I'll make a point to.
**Ahuettl**: To bring this situation up to him.
**Ahuettl**: We can, you know, ultimately, I do what JP Wants who.
**Ahuettl**: Who's got the pulse of radial, so we can look at some locations tomorrow and have some better information for you guys.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And so the fun of this was originally, like I said, we were supposed to do the disconnect of the Geek plus line this weekend.
**Bclymer**: And then the weekend of the 28th, we were going to do the panel move.
**Bclymer**: That's what was relayed to us all along.
**Bclymer**: Well, the other.
**Bclymer**: The disconnect of the Geek plus line already happened.
**Ahuettl**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: And now they're saying, can y' all get in here and move this panel this weekend?
**Bclymer**: So, like, Saturday, Sunday.
**Bclymer**: Yes, like very soon is the first thing.
**Bclymer**: And the.
**Bclymer**: The fun of that is our mechanical engineer or mechanical techs who were going to have a forklift removing conveyor and therefore could just pick up this panel.
**Bclymer**: Like, I would pull the wires, disconnect the conduit naked, lift it up, and physically move it.
**Bclymer**: Well, they won't.
**Bclymer**: Matt can correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think they'll be available nor have a forklift on site this weekend, because that's not what it was planned.
**Bclymer**: They're on a different project that was planned previously.
**Bclymer**: So that would be the other potential change is, you know, do y' all have a forklift on site that can just move the panel?
**Ahuettl**: We definitely don't have a forklift on site.
**Ahuettl**: That would be something.
**Bclymer**: Or something.
**Ahuettl**: Talk about tomorrow, but AJ I have.
**Brhoades**: A forklift order being delivered tomorrow.
**Ahuettl**: Okay, so you're tracking on this, then, Robert?
**Brhoades**: No, I'm not tracking on this, and I'd like to ask questions when we get a minute.
**Brhoades**: But, yeah, I have a forklift just to move our material and whatnot around, but we certainly use it to move this panel.
**Brhoades**: But I guess.
**Brhoades**: How many points are we disconnecting?
**Brhoades**: Are they.
**Brhoades**: Are they VFDs?
**Brhoades**: Are they frequency drive motors?
**Brhoades**: Are they DC motors?
**Brhoades**: Are they direct current?
**Brhoades**: What kind of.
**Brhoades**: What are we disconnecting?
**Brhoades**: Exactly.
**Bclymer**: So for this line, it's.
**Bclymer**: So for this portion, it's controlling all the stuff that controls this line.
**Bclymer**: So there's conduits that run over to control it all.
**Bclymer**: It Actually, I'm saying to Hinge, I'm.
**Ahuettl**: In my truck right now.
**Ahuettl**: I'm going to get out of my truck and go over to that and I'll switch my phone camera.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Ahuettl**: So just give me five minutes to walk inside.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And so the.
**Bclymer**: What would need to be moved is this curve is a vfd.
**Bclymer**: It just has power running and an ethernet cable running over over to it.
**Bclymer**: You know the power to run the, to power up the vsd and then the ethernet cable control it.
**Bclymer**: Then These are all 480 volt motors that control these lines.
**Bclymer**: So then you have, you have those 40.
**Bclymer**: What's that?
**Brhoades**: Are they on drives or are they not?
**Bclymer**: No, they're just 40 volt motors with a disconnect there.
**Bclymer**: And, and so this, so the idea of all this is there's four or five conduits running there.
**Bclymer**: One has the 480, one has 121 has 24.
**Bclymer**: They have, you know, the three wires plus the ground for each of these motors.
**Bclymer**: So there's one motor.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, let's see.
**Bclymer**: So there's a one motor there, another motor here, then another motor there.
**Bclymer**: So you can see there's.
**Bclymer**: What is that?
**Bclymer**: And then plus this here, then put a lift gate.
**Bclymer**: Then there's also some sensor wires.
**Bclymer**: So it could be easy.
**Bclymer**: What if you have a guy on site, you can see the conduits and see how many wires are running in there.
**Bclymer**: So it's literally just taking all those things.
**Bclymer**: If you need exact number of wires I can look through.
**Brhoades**: No, no, no, no.
**Brhoades**: I'm just trying to get an understanding.
**Brhoades**: So.
**Brhoades**: And then when it turns the 90, I guess all that conveyance that gets demoed, I guess it'd be running east and west.
**Brhoades**: I'm not real familiar with my.
**Bclymer**: So we're not, we're not talking about the demo.
**Bclymer**: We're not.
**Bclymer**: There's no more conveyor getting demoed for, for, for this word.
**Bclymer**: There's.
**Bclymer**: There's two different projects here.
**Bclymer**: So I'm trying to go through the one that's they want this weekend.
**Bclymer**: So the one they want this weekend is to take this mcp.
**Bclymer**: And so the good thing is all the conduits running this way.
**Bclymer**: So if you disconnect the wires inside the panel that go this direction, then.
**Ahuettl**: Robert, Robert and Donnie.
**Bclymer**: Just one second.
**Ahuettl**: So this is, this is the control panel.
**Ahuettl**: I'm counting 5, 8, 12, 13.
**Ahuettl**: Including that flex going into the panel, there's nothing going in the sides.
**Ataylor**: So.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: Need to be moved.
**Ataylor**: Are going to the right.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: The ones going to the right.
**Bclymer**: So the ones are turning right?
**Ahuettl**: Yeah, I mean, we have a lot going right here.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So those going right.
**Bclymer**: So the idea is the wires that are in those.
**Bclymer**: And if you need to open the panels and see the number of wires in each one.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: An idea is then those wires get pulled like disconnected from their terminals, leaving their wire labels and all that on.
**Bclymer**: And then it's.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Ahuettl**: Donnie.
**Ahuettl**: Donnie, what was in your original scope besides us disconnecting everything?
**Ahuettl**: Then you were going to move the mcp, all of these ladders that are standing up and the conduit.
**Ahuettl**: Were you expecting Deam and Alito to take care of all that for you?
**Bclymer**: No.
**Ahuettl**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Our mechanical crew will be doing that.
**Bclymer**: Once that's all disconnected.
**Bclymer**: There used to be conveyor on top of those are leg sets for conveyor.
**Bclymer**: We've already.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah, I call them ladders, but yeah.
**Ahuettl**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And the only reason you're still up is because of the conduit, so.
**Ahuettl**: Right, but you guys were going to originally take out the conduit.
**Ahuettl**: You just needed us to disconnect that control panel, correct?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So as the disconnect the control panel, the control panel gets moved way down here where you're.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Ahuettl**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: And so here's that curve where they were wanting it in this area.
**Bclymer**: So it is finding the area.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: So if you pause right there, you'll see the parts that are going straight away from you.
**Bclymer**: Those were made.
**Bclymer**: And then we need to tie into those.
**Ahuettl**: Right, Right.
**Ahuettl**: All of this conveyance over here.
**Ahuettl**: Donnie.
**Bclymer**: Huh?
**Ahuettl**: Like, where does this end?
**Ahuettl**: Because right now it's running to nothing.
**Ahuettl**: Right.
**Ahuettl**: It stops here.
**Ahuettl**: So are you.
**Ahuettl**: Are you.
**Bclymer**: That.
**Bclymer**: That conveyor does not need to be running right now for this phase.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Ahuettl**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So what needs to be so.
**Bclymer**: So what needs to be running is that other line.
**Bclymer**: See the line that's a little bit further Right here.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: Over there.
**Bclymer**: So where.
**Bclymer**: So there's conduits that run from that conveyor.
**Ahuettl**: So that control panel right now is powering this.
**Ahuettl**: This conveyance line that they need running.
**Ahuettl**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And so the idea is to take the.
**Bclymer**: Take the panel and put it in this area and reconnect those wires to get that running again.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Ahuettl**: So.
**Ahuettl**: So we were going to disconnect it and reconnect it.
**Ahuettl**: And you were.
**Ahuettl**: You were going to move it.
**Ahuettl**: And then who's running all the conduits to tie it back into that?
**Ahuettl**: Was that in deemed scope or was that in your scope?
**Bclymer**: No, putting conduits.
**Bclymer**: Since Dean's electrical contractor putting conduit in and doing all that is.
**Bclymer**: Would be.
**Bclymer**: Would be deemed.
**Ahuettl**: But you guys were going to demo all the conduits for us.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Once the conduit's dead, we, our guys will just take it out and demo it.
**Ahuettl**: And so this weekend, in fact, we'll.
**Bclymer**: Put on a palette and you are welcome to have it.
**Ahuettl**: I imagine so.
**Bclymer**: But.
**Ahuettl**: So this weekend, Donnie, Radio is.
**Ahuettl**: Was requesting for this panel to be moved and reconnected this weekend.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: So the idea is conveyor running.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, that conveyor that is, that is that conveyor that is running the little sleepy slide.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, it needs to be disconnected and then connect it back up and get running.
**Bclymer**: And that David, given us a price on that already on a portion of it, right?
**Ahuettl**: Well, I think they gave me that price now because that's going to get.
**Ahuettl**: Because we have a much larger contract with them.
**Ahuettl**: So.
**Ahuettl**: But that being said, I don't.
**Ahuettl**: I mean, Robert, I don't see us being able to do this this weekend.
**Brhoades**: Would you agree with 100%?
**Brhoades**: And then I'd still, you know.
**Brhoades**: So all the pipes that go to the right.
**Brhoades**: I understand there's multiple phases, but essentially what other phase we're talking about, they all need to go back into that control cabinet and re terminated, right?
**Ataylor**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: All the stuff that powers little sleepies needs to be connected back into the panel.
**Ahuettl**: So what, Robert, the way I see it, what we'll have to do.
**Ahuettl**: So tomorrow, Donnie, I'll get with and Matt, I'll get with JP and be like, hey man, this isn't going to happen this weekend.
**Ahuettl**: Obviously, like, we all know Radio, they're a phenomenal client, but they do like to spring stuff on us.
**Ahuettl**: So that's why they hire us, because we roll with the punches.
**Ahuettl**: But I don't see that being able to happen this weekend because what we'll need to do.
**Ahuettl**: So there's no downtime.
**Ahuettl**: And Robert, correct me if I'm wrong, but we'll have to basically run all this conduit so it's ready to go.
**Ahuettl**: And then when we turn it over, the downtime is going to be limited.
**Ahuettl**: It's just a matter of getting everything terminated and we're done.
**Bclymer**: What condo are you running?
**Bclymer**: There's.
**Bclymer**: It's an existing line.
**Bclymer**: There's conduit on the line already.
**Bclymer**: It's literally.
**Ahuettl**: I understand that, but we have to run.
**Ahuettl**: When we move this mcp, somehow we have to connect the existing conduits into the new location of the mcp.
**Ahuettl**: So there is conduit that has to.
**Bclymer**: Be run oh, yeah, there is a.
**Bclymer**: And so the original idea was to put the.
**Bclymer**: So there's already those up.
**Bclymer**: You know, all those conduits went up from the top of the panel, the original plan.
**Bclymer**: And that changed when they moved.
**Bclymer**: It was.
**Bclymer**: You know, there were like 12 conduits is what you had counted.
**Bclymer**: But only a certain number were going to the right.
**Bclymer**: So all those conduits that were going to the right, we were just going to pull the wire out of them, take the panel, including all the pieces that went up and were Kurt bent and all that, and just tie them back into this.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Reuse them and tie them right back into the same condo.
**Brhoades**: Yeah.
**Brhoades**: Can I ask a few questions here?
**Brhoades**: Sorry, but.
**Brhoades**: So just let me.
**Brhoades**: Help me understand.
**Brhoades**: Just.
**Brhoades**: I think I can help make this easier.
**Brhoades**: I mean, especially if we're doing the work right.
**Brhoades**: So all the conveyor that's highlighted in white that runs east and west up to that 90 that you just unhighlighted.
**Brhoades**: Right.
**Brhoades**: So the one that you just unholy.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Brhoades**: All that stays in place.
**Ataylor**: No.
**Ahuettl**: So that all goes.
**Ahuettl**: Goes away.
**Bclymer**: That is.
**Bclymer**: That is nothing that needs to be where the only conveyor that.
**Bclymer**: When we're done and the panel gets moved.
**Bclymer**: You don't need to worry about this yet.
**Bclymer**: That's.
**Ataylor**: Well, hang on.
**Ataylor**: I think Rob Robert's talking about the future.
**Ataylor**: The future.
**Ataylor**: So zoom out, Donnie.
**Bclymer**: I want to get past the weekend before I talk about this.
**Brhoades**: I know.
**Brhoades**: But I can make this a lot easier if I understand what the big scope is.
**Brhoades**: I can make.
**Brhoades**: Piece it together if we want.
**Brhoades**: But if I want to do it, I want to do it right and think about the next phase.
**Brhoades**: So.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so for the next phase.
**Bclymer**: Yes, watch.
**Bclymer**: I'll even do it.
**Bclymer**: So for the next phase, the idea is this conveyor that was right here gets moved.
**Bclymer**: So they.
**Bclymer**: They.
**Bclymer**: Once that panel is moved, the next phase is we will get rid of that conveyor.
**Bclymer**: Our guys will come in here and will.
**Bclymer**: Let me do this there.
**Bclymer**: It'll.
**Bclymer**: We'll shorten this conveyor.
**Bclymer**: That's us cutting this conveyor shorter.
**Bclymer**: And then we will.
**Bclymer**: Well, just moved it.
**Bclymer**: But that's fine.
**Bclymer**: The conveyor will be.
**Bclymer**: Will be done like that.
**Bclymer**: And then we'll install this conveyor right here.
**Bclymer**: And it needs to.
**Bclymer**: And then.
**Bclymer**: And then to repower it.
**Ataylor**: So all this is new.
**Ataylor**: I mean, it's the.
**Ataylor**: The old conveyor, but in a new location.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And the idea what we're doing here is our guys are moving these conveyors in very big sections where they're leaving the conduit on.
**Bclymer**: They of course had to spread the sections of port and cut the wire.
**Bclymer**: But we're leaving all the conduit intact.
**Bclymer**: And so the idea is we take this piece and butt it back up to this one.
**Bclymer**: All the conduit connects and so you will have conduit running to all the devices.
**Bclymer**: You have all the.
**Bclymer**: The disconnect still mounted, the sensor still mounted.
**Bclymer**: And all that conduit would come around, goes up the incline and then.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, from this point to here, like from here to wherever the panel is going to be that needs to get reworked.
**Bclymer**: So that is the conduit for the future.
**Bclymer**: So when you're planning for the future.
**Bclymer**: Yes, the panel is going to be over here somewhere.
**Bclymer**: And it will need to power this stuff this weekend.
**Bclymer**: Roi.
**Bclymer**: Sorry, It'll need a hazel conduits that power this stuff this weekend.
**Bclymer**: But in the future is.
**Bclymer**: It also needs to have.
**Bclymer**: It needs to power this stuff.
**Brhoades**: So approximately how many motors or points or approximately are on that second piece?
**Bclymer**: In the second piece you have five motors.
**Bclymer**: One, two.
**Bclymer**: And this one's a vfd, but the VFD is already there.
**Bclymer**: And so it literally is just still three conductors running there.
**Bclymer**: So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 motors.
**Bclymer**: Plus there's some devices which I would have to bring up some drawings to show.
**Bclymer**: Plus there is assorted like a photo eye at the end of each one.
**Bclymer**: I had that in a list.
**Brhoades**: That's cool.
**Brhoades**: I mean, I get it under.
**Brhoades**: So here's what I think we probably should do for the.
**Brhoades**: It seems like a pretty compact timeline.
**Brhoades**: So if you can go back to that 90 where I guess the mid.
**Brhoades**: I guess it's the.
**Brhoades**: The intersection of what remains and what gets reworked.
**Brhoades**: Right.
**Brhoades**: So my.
**Brhoades**: Yeah, my thought is.
**Brhoades**: Okay, so my thought would be go right, unlay in the panel, leave the labels on the wire like we.
**Brhoades**: Like we talked about.
**Brhoades**: We get the pipe out of there, you guys, or we can.
**Brhoades**: Whoever can move the cabinet.
**Brhoades**: We go to that 90 and we pull the pipe apart.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, like right here.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Brhoades**: With the wires in it.
**Brhoades**: We don't take the wire out.
**Brhoades**: So we're gonna have to slide the pipe off the wire, leave all that wire hanging there.
**Brhoades**: And then we set maybe a 24 by 24 box there.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Brhoades**: The only two variable drives.
**Brhoades**: So there shouldn't be any problem with inductance or anything like that because there's only two drives.
**Brhoades**: So I was concerned if we had a bunch of drives, we'd have inductance and we'd mess.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Brhoades**: That shouldn't be an issue with two drives.
**Brhoades**: So if we take all the pipe, pull it apart, set a box, pull the wire back into the box and then we can run maybe a couple 2 inch pipes or whatever it takes from that box out to the new location of the control panel.
**Brhoades**: The wires that go to the.
**Brhoades**: The stuff to remain, we could just refeed right through the pipe.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Brhoades**: Shorten them up and relabel them.
**Brhoades**: We're done.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And I was thinking of something similar that you probably would want some kind of junction box right here and that way all this conduit that's running the little sleepies line you now you've already pulled it back like you said, it's now you just run it through your conduits and you could.
**Bclymer**: And a lot of those pieces that are, that go up and are bent and attached to existing conduit could be reused, you know, so that could probably save y' all a good bit of time.
**Bclymer**: But yeah, put a junction box here and that way when you need to tie in the stuff for the next phase, it's already coming up here to your junction box and you just take.
**Brhoades**: Just a slight delineation though I'm not going to use it as a junction box.
**Brhoades**: So we're going to use it as a pull box.
**Brhoades**: So I'm not going to cut off wires.
**Bclymer**: Oh yeah, yeah, sorry.
**Bclymer**: I met pull box.
**Bclymer**: I met.
**Bclymer**: Okay, yes.
**Brhoades**: All right.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So I said junk the box.
**Bclymer**: But that's just understood.
**Brhoades**: I just want to make sure in case somebody got concerned about a bunch of junctions, it'll be a.
**Brhoades**: Yeah, yeah, yep.
**Brhoades**: We'll pull all.
**Brhoades**: So we'll have this big old coil wire underneath there when we're done.
**Brhoades**: Right.
**Brhoades**: That it goes all these locations, the stuff on the stuff second phase will be pulled out, discarded.
**Brhoades**: But all that stuff that's going to remain.
**Brhoades**: And he's back on.
**Brhoades**: We'll just have to refeed it through the new pipe into the panel, shorten it up, relabel it and re land it.
**Brhoades**: So when it's time to do the second phase, we just pipe all that new stuff back into the pull box and when we pull the new conductors, we leave it long enough to go in the control panel.
**Brhoades**: But the nice part about that pull box is we're not going to any of the motors and unlending them.
**Brhoades**: We're not touching controls, we're not touching limits, we're not touching e stops.
**Brhoades**: We simply just relaying the wire where it came from and we should be good to go.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: For the first phase.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah.
**Ahuettl**: So, yeah.
**Bclymer**: So the second phase, of course, that's.
**Brhoades**: Still an immense amount of work to do in a weekend.
**Brhoades**: I mean, that's, yeah.
**Ahuettl**: Well, that's, that's why tomorrow.
**Ahuettl**: Robert, now that we have a good idea of what it is they're actually after, I'm gonna meet with JP and I think you'll be here.
**Ahuettl**: But I, I, and we need to figure out this timeline because that's not going to happen this weekend.
**Ahuettl**: Right.
**Ahuettl**: And so we need to start planning though for when that can happen.
**Ahuettl**: And it would be nice SSI team, if you guys can figure out what we can, you can get guys here.
**Ahuettl**: So that way we're all here on site.
**Ahuettl**: Right.
**Ahuettl**: Because it's your design and we can do it all at once.
**Ahuettl**: I, I guess essentially.
**Ahuettl**: I mean, I don't want.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: The idea is they need it all done by.
**Bclymer**: They, they, Sorry.
**Bclymer**: They need the demo portion done by the end of the month.
**Bclymer**: The installing of the new line is.
**Bclymer**: That's why our original plan was next weekend.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah.
**Ahuettl**: So that gives us a little time to plan and to get the manpower, but to just, you know, it's Wednesday now or it's Tuesday, like, ah, it's not gonna happen.
**Ataylor**: That's what we said too.
**Bclymer**: That's what we've been telling them.
**Ataylor**: We had to ask a question.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, they asked check and good.
**Bclymer**: Now we checked.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah, they can, they can ask, but it's just not, you know, it'll have to be next weekend most likely and.
**Ataylor**: I guess available next weekend as well.
**Ataylor**: Like we can have someone there and move the panel while the fork truck there.
**Ataylor**: We'll be able to take down the legs, all that, all that good stuff.
**Ahuettl**: I just think it's always easier when, when especially you guys are on site and teams on site.
**Ahuettl**: I don't want necessarily that to be all, all on.
**Ahuettl**: I mean we can handle it, but all on us to make all that happen.
**Ahuettl**: And then you'd be like, oh wait, this actually works better here.
**Ahuettl**: And want to get JP's input too, so.
**Ataylor**: Well, Eric.
**Ataylor**: So Eric will be there.
**Ataylor**: Eric is our controls engineer.
**Ahuettl**: Huh.
**Ataylor**: And he, he will be there as well.
**Ataylor**: So he'll help get the line back up and running and.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah, you know, exactly.
**Ataylor**: All that, all that good stuff.
**Ataylor**: So either way, I mean, Eric, I think you were available this weekend and next weekend, is that correct?
**Bclymer**: I am, yeah.
**Ahuettl**: Okay, so whatever, let's shoot for next weekend.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Brhoades**: When we're saying weekend, is that this Saturday and Sunday, are we able to start Friday evening at 5 o' clock.
**Brhoades**: What is that?
**Brhoades**: What's that actual.
**Ataylor**: What's that window conversation with Alicia.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah, I'm assuming it's the weekend because I don't think Little Sleepies has weekend work, do they?
**Bclymer**: What I heard.
**Bclymer**: Well, we could.
**Bclymer**: We'll double check it.
**Bclymer**: But for what I heard, Little Sleepies ends at like 4:30 or 5 on Friday, and then they start running 6 or 6:30 on Monday morning.
**Ahuettl**: Okay.
**Brhoades**: Because almost to be in there Friday at 5 o' clock, getting the wire and everything out of the panel Friday night and then come back Saturday morning and start reworking it into the panel.
**Ahuettl**: I like that idea, Robert.
**Ataylor**: All right, so, so talking points for me with Alicia.
**Ataylor**: We want to shoot for 27th at.
**Brhoades**: 5Pm Then whenever they shut down and we have access.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: All right.
**Bclymer**: And so y' all are good.
**Bclymer**: There is a way to do it.
**Bclymer**: The first question she had is.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, can we put the, the panel in that area we talked about, like somewhere in here?
**Bclymer**: It sounds like yes.
**Bclymer**: So that's good.
**Ahuettl**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Another question she had was going to be done this weekend.
**Bclymer**: No, so, and then.
**Bclymer**: So that's good.
**Bclymer**: Like we have some of her answers.
**Bclymer**: They may not be the answer she wants, but they, they're the answer.
**Bclymer**: They are answers.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Answers that make sense.
**Bclymer**: And so it's kind of like it is the whole idea, you change it.
**Bclymer**: It's like, no, now you're risking little sleepies because you're trying to rush something.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Brhoades**: And just real quick, so I don't know, just for us, electrically speaking, is there any way to put that control panel underneath the straight part where it says time clock?
**Brhoades**: And because it's going to be harder to do these transfer maybe over there where it says time clock.
**Brhoades**: Oh, no.
**Ataylor**: So.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Oh, like here.
**Brhoades**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: No, that is.
**Bclymer**: If you look at when he was there before I could show pictures, there's a piece where the conduits.
**Bclymer**: There's a, there's.
**Bclymer**: There was a straight line running this way.
**Bclymer**: There's a place where the conduit goes up and then over and then back down.
**Bclymer**: And that's a forklift aisle.
**Bclymer**: So they drive stuff through here.
**Brhoades**: Because any.
**Brhoades**: If we can get it in a straight piece of conveyance, it's going to be easier, I think.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Brhoades**: Pipe and the wire and stuff back in.
**Bclymer**: So I know because, because you have all these conduits would just be running in a straight line right here and they run all the way across.
**Bclymer**: So it'd be like you literally disconnect it and can pull it back in, kind of set the same conduits with adding a pull box in there.
**Bclymer**: So you literally could just add a pull box right here and connect the conduits that are from here into it and the conduits here into it, and you're right back to where you started.
**Bclymer**: I like that idea better, too.
**Bclymer**: But we could.
**Bclymer**: We could ask them would they accept it?
**Bclymer**: Like, it would basically end up being about right here.
**Ahuettl**: So, Donnie, I'm assuming this is what you were talking about, where the forklifts are coming in and out of.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: But as much as they say that's a forklift aisle, remember the original system didn't have a line here, so they could drive forklifts here.
**Bclymer**: Well, now you have another line.
**Bclymer**: They work tables.
**Bclymer**: Are they going to really drive a forklift in here anymore?
**Bclymer**: But maybe they do.
**Bclymer**: Maybe they still cut through here and do something I don't know about.
**Ahuettl**: Well, we can.
**Ahuettl**: Like I said, tomorrow, we can put our eyes on it, Robert, when you're here, and we can get a better idea on where we can put this.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**Brhoades**: It seems like maybe a small issue, but, I mean, it really is a.
**Brhoades**: It changes the whole dynamic.
**Brhoades**: If we could.
**Ataylor**: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Ahuettl**: I mean.
**Ahuettl**: I mean, I.
**Ahuettl**: Ideally, we're putting it right here where there's already a guardrail and it's out of the way.
**Bclymer**: Well, it wouldn't be there because then it wouldn't tie into an existing conduit.
**Ahuettl**: So I'm.
**Ahuettl**: I'm seeing a lot of existing conduit right here.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So y' all can look at it better.
**Bclymer**: Y' all might find a place where it does work better because you can see there's all those same conduits.
**Bclymer**: All they did was go around a curve.
**Bclymer**: So it may be as simple as.
**Ahuettl**: Because there's them going to the line that needs to run.
**Ahuettl**: So.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, so it could.
**Ahuettl**: If we can put it right here, Robert, it's out of the way.
**Ahuettl**: It's.
**Ahuettl**: It's back to a guardrail and then.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So that is basically right here in the drawing, right?
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Correct.
**Bclymer**: I think they would kind of.
**Ataylor**: I.
**Bclymer**: From what they said, I think they would probably be good with that.
**Bclymer**: And then now.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, now you have all these straight pieces that you put your pull box right here.
**Ahuettl**: That's where it's.
**Ahuettl**: Where everything's running right here underneath this area.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: You can leave this stuff that's going around the curve because it'll come into handy in the future.
**Bclymer**: It'll be empty for now, but.
**Bclymer**: Hey, you.
**Bclymer**: Now you have conduits there.
**Bclymer**: They already do that up and over.
**Bclymer**: Then it's just tying them into the other curve in the future.
**Brhoades**: And aesthetically, I think it would be more pleasing to look at than what, you know, the other location too.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah, it'd just be out of the way too, right there.
**Ahuettl**: So we'll look at it tomorrow.
**Ahuettl**: Robert and then Pat and Donnie, if you guys want to just answer, you know, Alicia, you can handle that.
**Ahuettl**: Say you talk to us and I'll also chat with JP a little tomorrow when he gets into town around 11.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ahuettl**: And we can gear up for next weekend.
**Ahuettl**: So JP is.
**Ahuettl**: I'm pretty sure he's Alicia's boss.
**Ahuettl**: So he's the construction man.
**Ahuettl**: He's the construction manager.
**Ahuettl**: So he's, you know, directly under the coo.
**Ahuettl**: And so he.
**Ahuettl**: He is the one who is my boss on this.
**Ahuettl**: I guess he's got a pulse on everything.
**Ahuettl**: Probably not more the engineering route that Alicia is, but he's.
**Ahuettl**: He's got a pretty good Pulse on timeline, etc.
**Ataylor**: Cool.
**Ahuettl**: All right, so anything construction related.
**Ahuettl**: So you guys, us.
**Ahuettl**: He's the.
**Ahuettl**: He's the man with.
**Ahuettl**: With the answers and who we answer to.
**Ataylor**: All right, well, if you don't mind, shoot me an email or give me a call or something on how that conversation goes.
**Ataylor**: Just so we're kind of saying the same things.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah, for sure.
**Bclymer**: They give me somebody.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So now the panel ends up kind of being in this area is what you were saying.
**Ahuettl**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: So I can mention that to her.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah, there's a guardrail right there.
**Ahuettl**: I mean, it would be perfect.
**Brhoades**: Yeah, We've got to keep in mind is, you know, we do have to reroute the feeder.
**Brhoades**: So that's going to be the only piece, but we'll work through that.
**Ahuettl**: So the feeder to the panel.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Brhoades**: Yeah, we're talking about motor feet, branch circuits and things like that, but yeah, the feeder to the.
**Ahuettl**: Robert, I'm assuming that that is this flex conduit right here on the end.
**Brhoades**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Ahuettl**: Right now that's going all the way.
**Brhoades**: Yep.
**Brhoades**: To that panel by the break room.
**Ahuettl**: Over there on the west end.
**Ahuettl**: So we're bringing it farther away.
**Ahuettl**: So we will have to add some wire, I think, somewhere else.
**Bclymer**: Dean did give a quote on putting that to.
**Bclymer**: Over to that area we talked about.
**Bclymer**: And I think their plan was they were going to come from a different panel and run a new feeder.
**Brhoades**: We are.
**Ahuettl**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: And so is that coming from radial direct?
**Ataylor**: We're contracted for the panel move, but radial's going Straight with Dean for the feeder move.
**Ahuettl**: So radio.
**Ahuettl**: Radio will be going with us and so deem will subcontract with us on it.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Before that, we'd given them a.
**Bclymer**: We'd give.
**Bclymer**: Demon had given us a quote.
**Bclymer**: We had put some markup on it and passed it on to radio.
**Bclymer**: I don't know which POS they gave.
**Bclymer**: They may have.
**Bclymer**: Like he said, it sounds like they went straight to Alito, which is fine.
**Bclymer**: Makes sense.
**Ahuettl**: It's a lot.
**Ahuettl**: We have a lot more scope with theme with the doctors and everything.
**Ahuettl**: So it just.
**Ahuettl**: I think JP's trying to clean it up and.
**Ahuettl**: And why chat with him tomorrow about it too?
**Ahuettl**: I mean, if you guys already have a PO for.
**Ahuettl**: For a lot of this work, then.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And our P.O.
**Bclymer**: included, like Dean, you know, gave a price to us.
**Bclymer**: And there is some change order because they did change that panel up.
**Bclymer**: There'll be a.
**Bclymer**: Probably a limit of what they'll accept.
**Bclymer**: You know, so add a big amount of cost to it if possible, you know.
**Ahuettl**: Well, I know I have a PO on my way for my understanding.
**Ahuettl**: Deems full scope, they gave me a price as well for the movement of the panel, etc.
**Ahuettl**: And Robert, we just look at that tomorrow and either way, we'll handle it on the back end.
**Ahuettl**: That way we don't have to worry radial too much about it.
**Ahuettl**: But we'll get.
**Ahuettl**: We'll get paid somehow, some way.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: As long as.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And radio pace is all.
**Bclymer**: You know.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah.
**Ahuettl**: That's all that matters.
**Bclymer**: None of us are eating it.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Ahuettl**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: That panel will probably not only since all those conveyors come out to the right to connect.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: We would take the panel, move it, and then the.
**Bclymer**: You'd actually see the hmi or the push buttons would be on this side of the panel.
**Ahuettl**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: That way your conduits are still going off to the right.
**Bclymer**: Correct.
**Bclymer**: That way you can use all those.
**Bclymer**: All those pieces that are already pre bent to look.
**Bclymer**: You know, saves all that work.
**Ataylor**: Even if you have to modify the height, it's a lot easier.
**Ataylor**: You don't have to bend anything.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah.
**Ahuettl**: Well, it's all.
**Ahuettl**: It looked like it's all at the same heart.
**Ahuettl**: And that guardrail sits on that back end, so that works out for nice.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Then there are people right here.
**Bclymer**: Or just can come up to it.
**Bclymer**: It's good.
**Ataylor**: All right, guys, anything else we can talk about?
**Ahuettl**: I think we're good.
**Ataylor**: First meeting.
**Ahuettl**: I think we're good.
**Ahuettl**: We'll just plan on staying in communication.
**Ahuettl**: We'll set up another meeting here after tomorrow and we'll gear up for.
**Ahuettl**: For next weekend.
**Ataylor**: All right, cool.
**Ataylor**: That sounds good.
**Ataylor**: I'll go ahead and send Alicia from radio a message.
**Ataylor**: So, Guy, this weekend's not going to happen.
**Ataylor**: You know, we talked with you guys and we're shooting for next weekend and talk about, you know, when we can start on Friday.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah.
**Ahuettl**: And Matt, if she gives you any issues, happy to step in.
**Ahuettl**: Tell her to give me a call.
**Ahuettl**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: All right.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, I appreciate it.
**Ahuettl**: I think I've worked with Alicia on a couple other projects, so.
**Bclymer**: I think the whole idea with that is too, like, yeah, they wanted to run, they got to run a new feeder, and we're just now figuring out where that panel is going to be because they changed the plan and.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, it's.
**Bclymer**: So the blue with the next week was our original plan anyway.
**Ataylor**: So, yeah, I mean, there's, there's prep work that needs to happen.
**Ataylor**: So it's like we did the demo with two days notice and didn't even have a PO yet.
**Ataylor**: So this one we can't make happen as quickly.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, that was literally, they told us, hey, on Friday, can you be out here Monday and do that?
**Ahuettl**: Yeah, yeah, that's how it usually goes.
**Bclymer**: And it's like, yeah, we can, you know, so I guess, yeah.
**Ahuettl**: Robert, you got any questions?
**Ahuettl**: Nothing we can't handle tomorrow.
**Brhoades**: Yeah, I'm sure stuff will come up tomorrow, but I'm good for now.
**Ahuettl**: All right, sounds good.
**Ahuettl**: All right.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, if there are any questions tomorrow, just let me know.
**Ataylor**: We can schedule a follow up.
**Ahuettl**: All right, thanks, guys.
**Bclymer**: All right, cool.
