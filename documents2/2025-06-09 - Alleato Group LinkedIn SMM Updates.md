**Mcalcetero**: No, no, I'll show you what we're talking about, Maria.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Victoria**: All right.
**Victoria**: So on a social standpoint, it's just good to know which of these we can pull from to do like a, like legacy Alito builds.
**Victoria**: Like, you know, to bring up one from the past and make sure that it's definitely Alito.
**Victoria**: So let me see.
**Victoria**: Innovation Hotel and Serena by the Sea.
**Victoria**: Those are both not.
**Victoria**: Those are just pictures I know I've seen before.
**Mcalcetero**: Right.
**Victoria**: Okay, gotcha.
**Victoria**: I'm gonna go back to the calendar.
**Victoria**: So one of these.
**Victoria**: What can be.
**Victoria**: One of these posts can be a legacy Alito build to feature a past build that just, you know, shows longevity, which is a positive thing.
**Victoria**: And then the other one would be great to be a current build.
**Victoria**: So, Brandon and Maria, what project can we get assets from for this month?
**Jdawson**: Bloomington.
**Victoria**: Bloomington?
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah.
**Mcalcetero**: Bloomington.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Bloomington.
**Bclymer**: This is Jack.
**Bclymer**: Correct.
**Bclymer**: So Jack has been sending a lot, so.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I can ask him for that if you want to.
**Mcalcetero**: Jobs going on right now.
**Mcalcetero**: Correct.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: But Bloomington is Jack.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah.
**Mcalcetero**: Or Westfield.
**Bclymer**: Westfield.
**Bclymer**: Well, we're going to do a lot of things with Whitfield for the Millers.
**Bclymer**: Well, I can say.
**Bclymer**: Actually, you know what, Erica?
**Mcalcetero**: Well, I mean, if you're into a project update, I.
**Mcalcetero**: You know, the.
**Mcalcetero**: The we are the Millers thing is a parody, not a project update.
**Jdawson**: You can do a post about the hero split, but it's not a big job.
**Jdawson**: When we started this week.
**Victoria**: Sure.
**Victoria**: What.
**Victoria**: What is that?
**Victoria**: The hero split?
**Jdawson**: It's basically maintenance work for a landlord.
**Jdawson**: Not maintenance work, but.
**Jdawson**: And probably too small.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, that's you talking about the little thing that you're doing.
**Jdawson**: Thinking of active projects we have right now.
**Jdawson**: We could do radio, Avon.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, yeah.
**Mcalcetero**: I mean, yeah, I would do either Collective or Bloomington.
**Bclymer**: We have content for them.
**Bclymer**: So I can send you what we have.
**Bclymer**: Anika.
**Bclymer**: So Chad sent me a bunch of drones footage for Westfield, so I can send you that in Bloomington.
**Bclymer**: Let me text Jack.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: He said he will have some for me, so I'll ask him right now.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Victoria**: Okay, great.
**Victoria**: So, yeah, whatever project we can actually get some quality photos and videos from, we can feature.
**Victoria**: So, like, if you're really small, Project actually would really produce a really great photo.
**Victoria**: Then I say go for it.
**Victoria**: But it would have to be able to do that.
**Victoria**: Right.
**Victoria**: So we'll get those situated.
**Victoria**: And then the other thing to note is that the Mytha Miller's video needs to be reshot this week.
**Victoria**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So I'll send that to Andrew and team.
**Bclymer**: And Ian, our intern is back this Wednesday, so they're going to reshoot it when he's back because I think he was on a field trip with university.
**Bclymer**: So he's gonna be back.
**Bclymer**: So that's what I told you.
**Bclymer**: Let's just post the inter right now because that's the one that we have ready.
**Bclymer**: So I'll keep you posted.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Once we have it.
**Bclymer**: But they are reshooting it because it's a great video.
**Bclymer**: It's just that I told them, please make sure everybody is on frame.
**Bclymer**: In the frame, you know, so.
**Victoria**: Yeah, exactly.
**Victoria**: No, that's perfect.
**Victoria**: Yep.
**Victoria**: And the intern video is going up tomorrow.
**Bclymer**: Good.
**Victoria**: Other thing to shoot is A Day in the Life.
**Victoria**: This.
**Victoria**: I think we were talking about AJ being the one to shoot this.
**Victoria**: If not, we could get a couple people to shoot it and a couple videos a day.
**Bclymer**: We have already people.
**Bclymer**: So we have Alex.
**Jdawson**: What'd you say?
**Mcalcetero**: Said A Day in the life started.
**Mcalcetero**: AJ, what's to start at 9:30.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, whatever.
**Bclymer**: So, Annika, we have Alex doing it, Jack is doing it, AJ is doing it.
**Bclymer**: And I think Brandon should do it too, you know.
**Victoria**: Yeah, let's.
**Jdawson**: Let's start with.
**Mcalcetero**: I'm busy that day.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, let's start with Alex and Jack.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, I'll do it.
**Mcalcetero**: You just gotta like set it all up for me.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, we have it.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So they're doing it.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so Alex and Jack are doing it.
**Bclymer**: And so I'll keep you posted.
**Bclymer**: And I don't know.
**Bclymer**: So if we shall ask somebody else.
**Bclymer**: Well, I don't think Ken doesn't like that.
**Bclymer**: Glenn doesn't like that.
**Bclymer**: A.J.
**Bclymer**: maybe probably later.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I mean, I'm the only one.
**Jdawson**: I think of our guys who do project management, Brandon and I were the only two.
**Jdawson**: You know, Brandon.
**Jdawson**: Brandon shouldn't be managing projects, but he does.
**Bclymer**: Oh, you know what?
**Bclymer**: You know who else is doing it?
**Bclymer**: Andrew.
**Bclymer**: Andrew is doing it.
**Bclymer**: Andrew Cannon.
**Bclymer**: So we have.
**Jdawson**: As a project.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, we have Andrew, Alex and Jack.
**Bclymer**: Anika.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Victoria**: Okay, great.
**Bclymer**: I will remind them.
**Bclymer**: But I told them already to, you know, start getting ready for the.
**Bclymer**: With footage and everything.
**Bclymer**: Perfect.
**Victoria**: Yeah.
**Victoria**: And so that there will be a lot to come from this if we are able to do a series.
**Victoria**: So, like, one person will be one video and then we will be able to get a couple done for the next.
**Bclymer**: Perfect.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Victoria**: Yeah.
**Victoria**: Okay.
**Victoria**: The last thing that we need to chat through is anything that still needs approval.
**Victoria**: I think there's just one I need to confirm, and I think it's the precision build here.
**Victoria**: Right here.
**Victoria**: So we made sure the precision build is not trademarked, so that's taken off.
**Victoria**: And then I just need to know if it is approved.
**Mcalcetero**: Other than that, where did that come from?
**Victoria**: From the website.
**Mcalcetero**: You said precision build.
**Jdawson**: Whatever, Brandon.
**Jdawson**: Whatever happened to the optimized build stuff we were working on?
**Jdawson**: We have a bunch of that.
**Mcalcetero**: Where do we say precision?
**Bclymer**: I don't think we.
**Jdawson**: Must have been when you were in your sick trance.
**Jdawson**: You've been so sick lately.
**Jdawson**: And you said it.
**Jdawson**: Didn't even know you did.
**Mcalcetero**: Keep scrolling there.
**Mcalcetero**: Well, that sucks.
**Mcalcetero**: I didn't know that was on there.
**Victoria**: So you want to table this until you can reevaluate it?
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah.
**Victoria**: Okay.
**Victoria**: That's a fine move.
**Victoria**: With the legacy post and the other posts that we can feature this month that I'm talking about, we can fill the slide.
**Jdawson**: When did.
**Jdawson**: When did this website go live?
**Bclymer**: I think probably like two weeks ago, something like that.
**Mcalcetero**: All right, what's next?
**Victoria**: Let me check the calendar.
**Victoria**: I think that is it because everything improved.
**Victoria**: So we are good for June except for those particular points.
**Victoria**: Okay, Short, short call today.
**Victoria**: Just getting these things wrapped up.
**Mcalcetero**: All right, sounds good.
**Victoria**: Okay, great.
**Bclymer**: I'll keep you posted.
**Bclymer**: Any cast usual?
**Bclymer**: You know, once I get content, I'll send it your way and everything.
**Bclymer**: Okay, Everything I have.
**Bclymer**: I'll send that in.
**Bclymer**: We'll make sure you receive everything.
**Bclymer**: Force the team to do the videos.
**Victoria**: Okay, perfect.
