## Transcript
**Kbreig**: Included all flooring, or flooring, roofing, electrical, structural, getting engineer involved, you know, the whole.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Kbreig**: Getting caboodle.
**Kbreig**: When I went to go buy it out, Charles let me know that there was that 30k price increase.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Kbreig**: From his original quote to you back in March, which would have been.
**Kbreig**: This was the 30k increase.
**Kbreig**: So I had 177 plugged from him.
**Kbreig**: Yeah.
**Kbreig**: 177, 638.
**Kbreig**: And that would have put us well over our $300,000 mark.
**Kbreig**: So reached out, reached out to other guys actually.
**Kbreig**: Dean, who's doing the electrical there, they have an H VAC arm too.
**Kbreig**: So then we came up with that idea of.
**Kbreig**: To reduce the structural need, reusing the existing curbs with the curb adapter and ducting the new RTUs over right on top of the roof so we, so we didn't have to reuse openings or create new openings.
**Kbreig**: See.
**Kbreig**: And then we realized the existing RTUs do work.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Speaker 1**: So we thought.
**Kbreig**: Well they, we did think that they do.
**Kbreig**: So I'm getting there.
**Kbreig**: So.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Sorry.
**Kbreig**: No, you're good.
**Kbreig**: This, this was helpful for me too because a lot, you know, I've been trying to.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Kbreig**: Figure out the best route.
**Kbreig**: So discovered the existing rtus work.
**Kbreig**: You know, why can't we just do.
**Kbreig**: Duck those RTUs over and reuse the existing openings?
**Kbreig**: Me and my team guy, we, we confirmed that we could.
**Kbreig**: I let Charles know.
**Kbreig**: So he went and took a rooftop visit.
**Kbreig**: And on his rooftop visit he then told me they can't.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Kbreig**: Be reused and ducted over.
**Kbreig**: So he came back with a price.
**Kbreig**: If we're reusing those openings for new RTUs, we have to get a bigger crane.
**Kbreig**: His new price was astronomical.
**Kbreig**: Okay.
**Kbreig**: Yep.
**Kbreig**: It was 284.
**Kbreig**: Yeah.
**Kbreig**: Two RT new new RTUs, that's, that's way too expensive.
**Kbreig**: So I, I'm, I questioned him a little and I said, well, I pulled up the spec for these carrier units and I called out to him, I think it's here, number 14.
**Kbreig**: So these are your existing units and this is showing that we can.
**Kbreig**: And so I asked him the question.
**Kbreig**: There's got to be a way.
**Kbreig**: And so there is a way.
**Kbreig**: And that is, it's, it's a specialty curve.
**Kbreig**: Let's see what he said here.
**Kbreig**: He said, yeah.
**Kbreig**: So I told him 285k for 2 RTUS is pretty astronomical.
**Kbreig**: And then we called out page 14 and he said he totally understood.
**Kbreig**: The only, the only option is to get a special specialty curb adapter so we would lift the existing RTUs up, put a new curb there, set them back down, and then ducked over.
**Kbreig**: Okay.
**Kbreig**: And the whole reasoning for this is so we don't have to create new openings in this building.
**Kbreig**: That's right.
**Kbreig**: That's kind of what I'm trying to avoid because we got.
**Kbreig**: We probably then got to pull a permit and get a structural engineer involved.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Speaker 1**: I.
**Kbreig**: So this is it.
**Speaker 1**: It makes me nervous to lift it because we were told from Rogers if you do any moving of this, like there is no guarantee it'll work again.
**Speaker 1**: I think we should go back to the original plan and pull permits and.
**Kbreig**: Move it and just get a whole new location.
**Speaker 1**: I think so.
**Speaker 1**: Because that's the whole reason we were going to go with new to begin with is because.
**Speaker 1**: Is because they like warned us.
**Speaker 1**: They're like These units, they're 10 years old.
**Speaker 1**: So if you move them, there's a lot that can go wrong.
**Speaker 1**: And so you might be shooting yourself in the foot.
**Kbreig**: Okay.
**Kbreig**: Yeah, I haven't.
**Kbreig**: So I know like every 15 years you usually want to replace them.
**Kbreig**: So if we're wanting to get ahead of it and I'm not trying to make this more difficult, Kelly.
**Kbreig**: I'm just trying to make.
**Kbreig**: I'm trying to protect your guys wallet.
**Speaker 1**: As much as possible.
**Speaker 1**: I know.
**Kbreig**: Yeah.
**Kbreig**: And so if, if I can get this last option.
**Kbreig**: I haven't heard that from Charles.
**Kbreig**: Is he the one that said moving that rt you may.
**Kbreig**: Okay.
**Kbreig**: Because he's not giving me any pushback.
**Kbreig**: So what I'm going to do is I'm going to get this pricing from him.
**Kbreig**: And I know we want to get this done before it gets blistering hot.
**Speaker 1**: Right, Right.
**Speaker 1**: So if we need to go the route of permitting, like I would like to get that started immediately.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Kbreig**: For sure.
**Kbreig**: And.
**Kbreig**: And I'll probably have.
**Kbreig**: Have it run through Charles.
**Kbreig**: I have a permit open right now.
**Kbreig**: I would like to not do another addendum and see if he can't just pull the permit himself.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Kbreig**: But like I said, my whole goal is to try to avoid creating another opening and then try to avoid the structural.
**Kbreig**: Structural welding really what it is.
**Kbreig**: So that's kind of where I'm at.
**Kbreig**: So once I get this, we've exhausted every option.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Kbreig**: And then we'll be able to make the best educated decision.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Let's make a decision this week for.
**Kbreig**: For sure.
**Kbreig**: I just need this from him and I have everything else.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Kbreig**: So.
**Kbreig**: Perfect.
**Kbreig**: I was hoping to have it before here and I can work on it last night.
**Speaker 1**: And he did say in your defense.
**Speaker 1**: Right?
**Kbreig**: Yeah.
**Kbreig**: And I could lay them all out, but.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, he didn't get it.
**Speaker 1**: If you get.
**Speaker 1**: Sorry to cut you off.
**Speaker 1**: If you get it today, let's reconnect tomorrow and go through all the options and make a firm decision, and then we can create an actual timeline, because regardless, it's not going to happen in May.
**Speaker 1**: That's pretty obvious.
**Kbreig**: It could be really close.
**Kbreig**: It just depends on the permit.
**Kbreig**: I'm not going to promise anything.
**Kbreig**: That gives us 10 days.
**Kbreig**: Yeah, we can at least have the.
**Kbreig**: The RTUS on site.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: All right, cool.
**Speaker 1**: So when you get that, let's reconnect.
**Speaker 1**: I can.
**Speaker 1**: I can make myself clear.
**Speaker 1**: I'll prioritize this.
**Speaker 1**: Long story short.
**Speaker 1**: So just let me know when you get the information, and we'll set up 15 to go through it.
**Speaker 1**: All right?
**Kbreig**: Yep.
**Kbreig**: That sounds good.
**Kbreig**: I.
**Kbreig**: I know Memorial Day is coming up, too, so it'd be nice to get this off our plate before then and have a plan.
**Kbreig**: A plan and set.
**Kbreig**: I know you got people that you have to talk to, so.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Kbreig**: Like I said, I'm not trying to be difficult.
**Kbreig**: I'm just trying.
**Speaker 1**: No, you're not.
**Speaker 1**: I know.
**Kbreig**: We're trying to be as much as possible.
**Speaker 1**: Yes.
**Speaker 1**: Yes.
**Speaker 1**: And you.
**Speaker 1**: I mean, you know how it's been in Dallas, so appreciate the protection.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Good deal.
**Kbreig**: Sound good?
**Speaker 1**: Yep, sounds good.
**Speaker 1**: Thanks, aj.
**Kbreig**: All right.
**Kbreig**: See you.
**Speaker 1**: Bye.
