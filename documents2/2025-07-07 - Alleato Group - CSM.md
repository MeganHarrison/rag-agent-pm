## Transcript
**Bclymer**: Hey, good morning.
**Bclymer**: Hi.
**Jdawson**: Good morning, Chris.
**Accounting**: Hello.
**Accounting**: Good morning.
**Bclymer**: You guys have a good weekend?
**Bclymer**: Yes, it's good.
**Accounting**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Well, I'm just, just looking at your cases here.
**Bclymer**: It looks like you only have one open.
**Bclymer**: Did the import scenario go okay and that's in your system working?
**Bclymer**: Well, I think you were importing AP bills.
**Jdawson**: Yes, it works.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we had no issue.
**Jdawson**: I mean we had but actually help us to fix it and.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, no, no, no issue now.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, very good.
**Bclymer**: That's good to hear.
**Bclymer**: Yes, I saw Miguel was available to meet today.
**Bclymer**: Did you get a meeting scheduled with him last week or that was someone on our support team who offered to meet today to go over.
**Bclymer**: Maybe it was an AMEX reconciliation.
**Accounting**: Yeah, that one they're not.
**Accounting**: Is there an invite for that?
**Bclymer**: I think he was asking for your availability.
**Bclymer**: But if you were to either reply to the email with your availability, like it could be today or tomorrow.
**Bclymer**: Otherwise.
**Bclymer**: Sometimes they have a book with me at the bottom of their email and he does have one.
**Bclymer**: It's like under his name tag it says book with me.
**Bclymer**: Always feel free to do that if you need to.
**Bclymer**: But I think he just asked at the bottom of the email to let him know when you are available.
**Bclymer**: But either way, I mean he can provide some times or you could just book directly if that link works.
**Bclymer**: If not, figure it out a different way.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Accounting**: Yeah, this one.
**Accounting**: Sure.
**Accounting**: Book a meeting with me.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Sometimes it's easier just to hop on a call and like get an issue figured out.
**Accounting**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: Actually because we have a lot of emails going on.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: Still that doesn't result.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So feel free to do the book with me whenever.
**Accounting**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Because it is.
**Bclymer**: It's a burden to have to keep going back and forth.
**Bclymer**: And then there's a long weekend, you know, so there's a lot of things going on.
**Bclymer**: So hopefully you could just meet with him and then get that one crossed out and off your list.
**Accounting**: Oh yeah.
**Bclymer**: How's everything else been going in acumatica?
**Bclymer**: Has it been going well?
**Bclymer**: Are you finding anything that's like troublesome or struggling?
**Accounting**: Maybe the reports.
**Accounting**: Yeah, but still I'm still looking into it.
**Accounting**: Like for the AP aging.
**Accounting**: I hope you have that.
**Accounting**: I already saw that there is a report like for the AP aging.
**Accounting**: There's a specific report that I need because usually every cutting of the checks, I need a report where I can see the outstanding payable and then the project is already there.
**Accounting**: And as I also need the details or the description of that particular invoice, I already see a report where There is a project for the invoices for the particular project.
**Accounting**: So I just don't know how we can create a report with having those details that we wanted.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so you do see a report.
**Bclymer**: I could share my screen and we can just kind of talk through it.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Maybe there's something that doesn't need to be modified.
**Bclymer**: Otherwise, we could always talk about whether a modification needs to be made or like an enhancement to a report.
**Bclymer**: Let me just check your payable preferences to see.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so you can have multiple projects per AP bill, and you're just looking for open documents by project.
**Accounting**: AP Aging by Pry.
**Accounting**: I see, but I usually use AP Aging, but yeah, it's not so detailed.
**Bclymer**: Okay, well, let's just say it was age of today.
**Bclymer**: I guess you could run this by a project if you were looking for just one project.
**Bclymer**: Like this is Project X23111.
**Accounting**: Yeah, but I need the description as well so that I. I will no longer open it one by one to see the description.
**Bclymer**: Sure.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: The.
**Bclymer**: I mean, the description could be added like enhanced if.
**Bclymer**: I don't know if Jose is the one internally that makes modifications or enhancements, but all of these reports are built in a report designer.
**Bclymer**: We could do it for you if, if you choose otherwise.
**Bclymer**: Some clients do it in house, but I.
**Bclymer**: So I used to work for a general contractor that used Acumatica and I was kind of the one that would just go into the back end, add like, kind of like tailor the reports to the accounting needs.
**Bclymer**: But whenever I see like a reference number that just makes me believe that I could add anything from this document to that line.
**Bclymer**: So it could be this description.
**Bclymer**: You know what I mean?
**Bclymer**: Like, yeah, anything from this page could be added to this.
**Bclymer**: It just out of the box is not.
**Bclymer**: And maybe there is multiple versions detailed with retainage.
**Bclymer**: I would assume the details would have it, but.
**Bclymer**: And you want the 30 day, 60 day, 90 day.
**Bclymer**: That's.
**Bclymer**: That's kind of like what you're looking for.
**Accounting**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, that's just more of a summarized view.
**Bclymer**: So I mean, it could be added to this report like the.
**Bclymer**: What you're looking for.
**Bclymer**: And what you are looking for.
**Bclymer**: Is this description, correct?
**Accounting**: Yes, yes.
**Bclymer**: So if I were to add it, whenever I would do that stuff, I would always click like inspect element, click the field I want and then it actually tells you what the data field is.
**Bclymer**: And then it's generally a little bit easier to.
**Bclymer**: To add it to a report.
**Bclymer**: But I could look internally.
**Bclymer**: This 30, 60, 90 definitely is like a report.
**Bclymer**: There's other ways you can get the description, but it's not necessarily.
**Bclymer**: It'd be like the bills and adjustments, adding the project or having like a bills and adjustments line level.
**Bclymer**: I don't believe dashboards, just kind of.
**Bclymer**: I'm just looking at the different dashboards you have.
**Bclymer**: I'm pretty sure.
**Bclymer**: Okay, looks like this does not have 30, 60, 90.
**Bclymer**: Do you ever use these dashboards, like the controller dashboard or anything like that?
**Accounting**: No.
**Bclymer**: No.
**Accounting**: Very sick.
**Accounting**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: No.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Something that Jose, is that your position at the company is to kind of like do the acumatica back end, whether it's import scenarios, reports or.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, the position is an accountant.
**Jdawson**: But I think modifications should.
**Jdawson**: Should be done by Fatima, I guess because I haven't, I haven't done.
**Jdawson**: I haven't doing that, but maybe Fatima, I think for any modification to do something.
**Bclymer**: So I don't know if you've used this Open University.
**Bclymer**: This is how I learned how to modify reports.
**Bclymer**: And then when you like if you were to do a modification to the report designer, it's in a platform that kind of looks like this, there's a lot of like, kind of protocols you want to set up just to make sure you don't break anything.
**Bclymer**: You make copies, you know, like there's.
**Bclymer**: You want to make sure that if you're making a modification, you're saving the previous version because otherwise you'll just lose the previous version, overwrite it and you could break it.
**Bclymer**: So you really got to be careful.
**Bclymer**: And that's why a lot of companies will just pay like a company like revive to do it for them, just because we do it all day.
**Bclymer**: So we're more accustomed to those safety protocols.
**Bclymer**: But this Open University, there's a reporting and customization section.
**Bclymer**: It's kind of under this implementation consultant badge.
**Bclymer**: There's analytical.
**Bclymer**: You're familiar with integration scenarios.
**Bclymer**: That's like import scenarios.
**Bclymer**: But report designer is a specific course here.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Also dashboards too.
**Bclymer**: I believe there would be some dashboards, but there's plenty of content here, at least from my point of view.
**Bclymer**: It looks.
**Bclymer**: I think each one of these is a longer set.
**Bclymer**: So if that's something that you're going to pursue or would like to always do it in your testing environment, if you have a testing environment.
**Bclymer**: If you don't, let me know.
**Bclymer**: But that's just something that, like an ad of description here isn't really that tough.
**Bclymer**: I mean, you just.
**Bclymer**: If you don't use branch, which it looks like you don't, you could literally just replace Branch, put in description and then add a description line here and just an existing field that's not being used.
**Bclymer**: But you do want to make sure you understand version control.
**Bclymer**: There's like this report version section.
**Bclymer**: That's why I mentioned make a copy of it.
**Bclymer**: And then when you, let's just say you identify.
**Bclymer**: Oh, a change I, A change that I made was incorrect.
**Bclymer**: I can go back to the previous version if I am working in that methodology.
**Bclymer**: Okay, yeah, so otherwise, I mean we can always quote something like that.
**Bclymer**: It's, it's not a huge lift to add a field like that.
**Bclymer**: So it just depends on what you all at Alito wanted to do.
**Bclymer**: But yeah, you can drill in otherwise.
**Bclymer**: Sometimes there's like a line level inquiry, but it might not show that.
**Bclymer**: 30, 60, 90.
**Bclymer**: I'd have to talk to someone in support to see if that's something that they have.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I don't know.
**Bclymer**: See it there.
**Bclymer**: So I can get back to you on that report.
**Bclymer**: But if, if, Jose, if your team was to make a change like that, you can always reach out to me and I can at least provide this to you.
**Bclymer**: I'll.
**Bclymer**: I'll drop it in the chat here.
**Bclymer**: Just so you know, I don't know if you've watched any of these videos before or gone through like the training guides or the, they just.
**Bclymer**: There's a lot of knowledge in this Open University.
**Jdawson**: Okay, yeah, okay, I will review that, that page.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, definitely.
**Bclymer**: And then if, if you were to go back just to like the course catalog, I believe it was maybe that is too far back.
**Bclymer**: Wherever I was before that, I think it's under learning paths.
**Bclymer**: So you go to like learning paths.
**Bclymer**: Choose the implementation consultant.
**Bclymer**: But here you can see more of the dashboards.
**Bclymer**: I believe dashboards would be data retrieval and analysis.
**Bclymer**: All these are generic inquiries, but I can send that to you as well.
**Bclymer**: But I will just send a few of these that I find to be very helpful.
**Bclymer**: Oh, here it is.
**Bclymer**: It's S160.
**Bclymer**: So I just sent you the report designer, the generic inquiry and pivot tables, and then also a dashboard.
**Bclymer**: And the nice part about like if you were to learn generic inquiries and all that, a dashboard is created from generic inquiries.
**Bclymer**: So if you get a, like if I were to look at this, maybe this isn't helpful for you, but you could, you can have a filter on a GI that is helpful.
**Bclymer**: All these are made from generic inquiries.
**Bclymer**: So, so when I click into it, it just pulls up and this actually might be what you're looking for.
**Bclymer**: Something like this Where.
**Bclymer**: But it's by vendor and not by there.
**Bclymer**: There should be a way that like this has the do in 7, 30 and 60, so it's a little bit more soon than probably that other report.
**Bclymer**: But I know.
**Bclymer**: Jose, are you familiar with like side panels and all that?
**Jdawson**: No.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: That's okay.
**Bclymer**: Just trying to gauge because sometimes that is a way that you can enhance your experience pretty easily without.
**Bclymer**: Without customization.
**Bclymer**: I'm just going to pull up my demo environment and see what I have.
**Bclymer**: So in my demo environment, I always just like create random stuff whenever I'm not a consultant anymore.
**Bclymer**: But I just have a demo environment that I play around with whenever I talk with people and try to like hear out what they're going through.
**Bclymer**: But like a bills and adjustments screen here I think I have a line level bills and adjustments somewhere.
**Bclymer**: But a side panel is pretty easy.
**Bclymer**: You just go to the generic inquiry screen and then I believe it's navigation.
**Bclymer**: And then you could add like let's say I want to view a vendor profile to quickly like see whether it's a 1099 vendor or maybe to update certain things.
**Bclymer**: This the same logic will go with like in that in this previous one that I showed you.
**Bclymer**: Like, my thought is maybe you could add a side panel of what bills are consistent for each vendor.
**Bclymer**: So you can see your high level by vendor and then the side panel of the detailed information.
**Bclymer**: But here you can just select how is the GI link to the field that you're adding.
**Bclymer**: That would be just say, so I just added a vendor side panel.
**Bclymer**: So now I have this side panel and you can add a dashboard to the side panel.
**Bclymer**: You could do a lot of different things.
**Bclymer**: But now if it's like brand glue is that line level?
**Bclymer**: Just got to make sure I did it right.
**Bclymer**: Well, let me just show you one that I know that I've done.
**Bclymer**: It takes trial and error, like everything does.
**Bclymer**: But like under projects, maybe you've seen this, there's side panels.
**Bclymer**: So like here I can view my customer, you can view the actual data entry screen or like a list of details.
**Bclymer**: So a lot of times like at the last company I worked at, I had the accountants and the project managers always working from like a list and a side panel view just so they could go through it, refresh, and then their list gets smaller as they're working.
**Bclymer**: But this might.
**Bclymer**: This mindset of using dashboards and side panels just makes it so you have less and less customization.
**Bclymer**: Like yeah, you could customize this report that you wanted, which may be the ultimate goal.
**Bclymer**: But you also could do other things like if you didn't have the knowledge to.
**Bclymer**: To change a report like this or you just maybe prefer different views that you can export to Excel quicker or whatever it may be.
**Bclymer**: But Jose, this might be helpful if you go through those.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, these open sources, they talk about side panels probably in the generic inquiry one that I sent you.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: It would have been called inquiries, reports and dashboards.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: But I'll talk to support and just see if there's anything that they have that's like a generic inquiry for me.
**Bclymer**: I was just thinking a side panel of this may be helpful.
**Bclymer**: And then you could just say like.
**Bclymer**: Like a side panel could be the bills and adjustments screen that just shows open documents and then you could at least get a list of all the open with the detailed and I could show you that one would be a little bit easier I believe.
**Bclymer**: But yeah, you got that entry point navigation tab under.
**Bclymer**: Okay, do you guys have access to these reports or.
**Accounting**: Yeah, I have actually.
**Accounting**: I just knew it that there is a dashboard where I can see the ape outstanding overdue account, something like that.
**Bclymer**: You do see it or you want to see something like that?
**Accounting**: You said it's.
**Accounting**: I just see it.
**Accounting**: I just knew that it exists.
**Bclymer**: Oh, okay.
**Accounting**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And I.
**Bclymer**: So if you.
**Bclymer**: Jose, if you wanted a few like our AP clerk one maybe you need more of a controller view.
**Bclymer**: But these can be pretty extensive.
**Bclymer**: If you're like we got our AP aging.
**Bclymer**: This is the kind of report I was.
**Bclymer**: I was thinking about where it shows all the vendor details.
**Bclymer**: And this is actually bill by bill so something like this would be a lot easier to add a description, enter details.
**Bclymer**: Maybe you have this report.
**Bclymer**: This may be a custom report that we've created, but here's a.
**Bclymer**: A description from the bill I believe.
**Bclymer**: And then we have a side panel set up so it's like you can actually see the details.
**Bclymer**: But yeah, that input AP bill is the description and that's right there.
**Bclymer**: But to help you out, I could just put this in your system and then you can add to it or subtract to it whatever you wanted.
**Bclymer**: So let me just export as XML and then I go into your system.
**Bclymer**: Do you know your access rights?
**Bclymer**: Are you both admins or like are you familiar with access rights in Acumatica?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I'm not sure if I have access as I am in.
**Jdawson**: But no, I need to ask Fatima.
**Jdawson**: Okay because she assigned.
**Jdawson**: It.
**Bclymer**: Looks like you do have this report in your system.
**Bclymer**: So that called vendor details and it shows the 7, 30, 60, 30, 60, 90, 90 plus.
**Bclymer**: So something like this is probably what you're looking for.
**Bclymer**: And you got the side panel.
**Bclymer**: The only thing that I would change, which I can help you right now and do it.
**Bclymer**: But Jose, this is probably something that you would be doing long term.
**Bclymer**: You just choose the table and then it was called doc description.
**Bclymer**: So I saved this and now view the inquiry.
**Bclymer**: We have the description that we were, but may be something.
**Bclymer**: Now you got to think about project because that's why I was looking at the beginning of how you do your.
**Bclymer**: Your AP bills.
**Bclymer**: You allow multiple projects per AP bill and this would be by vendor.
**Bclymer**: So you might need another.
**Bclymer**: You might have to do a little bit more to get the project because that's what you care about, right?
**Bclymer**: Is project specific for that?
**Bclymer**: Okay, well I, I could have our team just quote out what it would be to add description to this.
**Bclymer**: Otherwise, Jose, if that's something that you want to learn how to do, I would say start with those.
**Bclymer**: Here it is, the one that I sent you first.
**Bclymer**: It's this S150 report designer.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: It'll go a long way.
**Bclymer**: You'll be able to click like edit report.
**Bclymer**: And when you click edit report, it gives you like the actual file of this.
**Bclymer**: And then you can.
**Bclymer**: You'll need to download the acumatica report designer, which there should be steps in those videos of how to do that.
**Bclymer**: But then you'll just see what the.
**Bclymer**: This isn't.
**Bclymer**: This is a blank report.
**Bclymer**: When you actually look at a report, it's gonna, it's gonna look more like this whenever it shows up here, but it's gonna look more like this.
**Bclymer**: And then you'll just click where you want.
**Bclymer**: And then you can change to doc description or whatever it may be.
**Bclymer**: But it's pretty simple to make a change like that.
**Bclymer**: It's just not something that I, I can do like on the fly right here.
**Bclymer**: But we could quote it if you wanted us to do it for you.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Does that work for you?
**Bclymer**: And then maybe if you, if you can't, like, do you want a quote for this to see what it would be for revive to do it for you?
**Bclymer**: Or is this something, Jose, you want to just take a stab at?
**Jdawson**: Well, yeah.
**Jdawson**: I will review the information you have sent and then I will let you know if we need two additional assistants for doing that.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, okay, perfect.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Sorry about the vendor details.
**Bclymer**: One, I thought that was gonna.
**Bclymer**: It added the description, but now you got to think about the project.
**Bclymer**: So there's just a little bit more to think about.
**Bclymer**: You could always have this side panel open, and it's going to show you the project, but it's not necessarily a clean way to do it.
**Bclymer**: Like, project is here.
**Bclymer**: And then as you click down on the lines, this is actually changing the side panel.
**Bclymer**: So it can be powerful.
**Bclymer**: It's just you kind of need to sit down and review your process pretty thoroughly to make it work for you.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Perfect.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Well, I don't have really anything else.
**Bclymer**: Please review those videos.
**Bclymer**: Reach out to me if you have any questions.
**Bclymer**: And if it's something you just want us to do for you, let us know and we can get that covered in your system.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: Hope you have a good one.
**Bclymer**: Thank you.
**Jdawson**: Bye.
