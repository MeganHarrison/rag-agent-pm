**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: I need to catch up on my emails.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Fritzi, did we add what's his name, Ian, to the timesheet last week?
**Accounting**: I'm yet to add him.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Accounting**: Because Chad is asking Ian, what is his last name?
**Accounting**: Sorry.
**Bclymer**: Yes, everything is in the accounting chat.
**Bclymer**: So if you go to our group chat, you will find the offer letter with his start date, all the benefits and everything, and his last name and everything is there.
**Bclymer**: And then don't forget that payroll is running this Friday, so.
**Bclymer**: So we need to have those timesheets ready latest tomorrow afternoon.
**Bclymer**: So that's good.
**Bclymer**: So we can send them.
**Bclymer**: Because remember, the 26th, we don't work, so.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, we usually do the payroll on Friday, so that's good.
**Bclymer**: So that's on my side.
**Bclymer**: And then I don't know, guys, if you need me for anything specific.
**Bclymer**: How are we with the cois for the other person that needed needing them for the other audit?
**Bclymer**: Did we collect them all?
**Bclymer**: Fritzi, I saw that you were following up with Them?
**Accounting**: Oh yeah, I think Jose had already.
**Accounting**: That's still the update that we have.
**Accounting**: I still don't get a.
**Accounting**: An email, follow up from them, a response from them.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so let.
**Bclymer**: Let.
**Bclymer**: If.
**Bclymer**: If they don't, please let Brandon know so he can nudge them.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Let's give more minutes to see if Brandon connects.
**Bclymer**: I know he's in another meeting.
**Bclymer**: If not, we just, you know, we can roll it up.
**Fnjie**: It.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so Brandon is busy, but he's telling me I sent you yesterday guys an accounting ticketing.
**Bclymer**: I don't know if you saw that.
**Bclymer**: Like a tracking patient notion that Brandon wants to start using.
**Bclymer**: So if there are like open issues, let's start putting them there.
**Bclymer**: If they are already like something missing, for example, this CIO's COI.
**Bclymer**: Sorry Friti that are missing or something like that.
**Bclymer**: Let's put them on that ticketing or tracking page in Notion so Brandon can look at them and then follow them up.
**Bclymer**: So I share everything with you on the channel, so just make sure to follow that.
**Bclymer**: Also, Brandon is asking Jose if you were able to get approved transactions uploaded.
**Justin**: Yeah, I did for Joe Planner and Prokor in this morning and everything goes.
**Justin**: Goes without any issue.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so that's good.
**Bclymer**: So they're in about the tracking thing.
**Bclymer**: So don't forget to check that ticketing and tracking that I send you.
**Bclymer**: And he's asking one second.
**Bclymer**: And make sure they have all the invoices that need to be coded.
**Bclymer**: Is all the invoices that need to be coded direct cost in Notion and they are reaching to project managers to get them coded, please.
**Bclymer**: So it's that done, correct.
**Bclymer**: Guys?
**Jdawson**: The what?
**Bclymer**: The.
**Bclymer**: The coded.
**Bclymer**: The coded invoices.
**Bclymer**: So that's done, right?
**Bclymer**: That's you, Fritzi.
**Bclymer**: That's coding AP invoices.
**Bclymer**: One second.
**Bclymer**: So it's saying make sure they have all the invoices that need to be coded as direct costs in Notion.
**Bclymer**: Do we have that already?
**Bclymer**: And that they are actually following up with project managers to get them coded, please.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So pretty.
**Bclymer**: That's you?
**Accounting**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So you're working on it?
**Accounting**: Yes, under pending invoices.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: And also I talked to Megan.
**Bclymer**: I think I'll let you know.
**Bclymer**: So she said that she cannot recreate the exact view that we have on Excel.
**Bclymer**: But.
**Bclymer**: But she said that if you can give it a try to the way it is and then she's going to add something because I know you need like a summation of things but she cannot recreate the exact one on the spreadsheet.
**Bclymer**: So it is a different view.
**Fnjie**: So.
**Bclymer**: So it's definitely going to be a change, but we need to get used to it.
**Bclymer**: So I'll let you know when she's done with it, okay?
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay, Perfect, guys.
**Bclymer**: And don't forget to start taking out looking at that page of the tracking and ticketing issues on Notion.
**Bclymer**: So if you have something pending, just go ahead and add it there and play with it and that's it.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Sorry for saying, do you have the.
**Accounting**: Link in what is the ticket?
**Accounting**: Ah, okay.
**Accounting**: Is that the accounting tracking?
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Correct.
**Bclymer**: That's the one.
**Bclymer**: So you let me.
**Bclymer**: Just let me know if you have questions.
**Bclymer**: But it should be very simple to use, so you just duplicate one.
**Bclymer**: If it's like something pending or something missing, just go ahead and play with it.
**Bclymer**: To be honest, nobody's using it.
**Bclymer**: If you play with it, it wouldn't affect anything.
**Bclymer**: So just go ahead and make sure that you guys are using it.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Justin**: Okay, thank you.
**Bclymer**: Thank you, guys.
**Bclymer**: Thank you so much.
**Bclymer**: Bye.
**Jdawson**: All right, bye.
