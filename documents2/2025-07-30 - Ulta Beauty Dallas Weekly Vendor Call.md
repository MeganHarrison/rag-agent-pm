## Transcript
**Crusin**: Good afternoon, everyone.
**Crusin**: I know we will be missing a few folks today, but I'll give it one more minute.
**Crusin**: Okay, let's get going here.
**Crusin**: General update.
**Crusin**: I am on site this week, leaving tomorrow afternoon.
**Crusin**: So if there's anything you've got me or you want me to check on, let me know.
**Crusin**: But overall, on site activity, raining.
**Crusin**: Pretty busy here.
**Crusin**: Obviously we're about week and a half away from our 811 go live, so lots of stuff to clean up.
**Crusin**: Some, some smaller risks out there, but overall I think we should be tracking to that 811 date.
**Crusin**: I'll go over that with everyone, but I believe it's mostly on the lei side and I know we're missing Blake today, so like I said, I'm on site right now.
**Crusin**: Steve Hooper will be on site next week from starting 84 through 87.
**Crusin**: And then I'll be back the week after, potentially next weekend.
**Crusin**: All right, let's get into updates then.
**Crusin**: Brett, do you have anything for today?
**Crusin**: Brett, are you on with hydrogen?
**Shooper**: Sorry, I stepped away.
**Shooper**: I, I heard you.
**Shooper**: No, we are currently, we are working on getting those air parts ordered and trying to get those as soon as possible.
**Crusin**: Though the airports, you said?
**Blake.robbins**: Yes, sir.
**Blake.robbins**: Yep, yep.
**Shooper**: We have, I'm.
**Shooper**: We have all the fittings.
**Shooper**: It's just getting the airline and getting that.
**Shooper**: That quantity ordered and, and sent down there.
**Brandon.robbins**: Okay.
**Crusin**: Steve and I did just talk to Craig about an hour ago.
**Blake.robbins**: Yep.
**Crusin**: Seemed like there was a little bit of confusion on what exactly was needed, whether it was half inch or three quarter.
**Crusin**: Did you talk to him at all after that?
**Blake.robbins**: Yes.
**Shooper**: Or talk to.
**Crusin**: Did Craig talk to Steve about an hour ago?
**Blake.robbins**: Yes.
**Blake.robbins**: Yes.
**Blake.robbins**: Yep.
**Crusin**: Steve, you haven't had any follow ups with him yet, have you?
**Crusin**: No, I have not heard back since.
**David.douglas**: The two of us talked to him.
**Shooper**: Yeah, no, I mean Craig's currently working on it.
**Shooper**: I mean that's.
**Shooper**: We're working with the dealer trying to.
**Shooper**: Trying to find out exactly.
**Shooper**: But he said what.
**Shooper**: We're only needing the one size though, right?
**Brandon.robbins**: You.
**Shooper**: There was a, the.
**Shooper**: You were saying we only needed all three quarter.
**Brandon.robbins**: Right.
**Shooper**: I think there was a confusion of needing half inch and three quarter or three quarter and one inch.
**Crusin**: Yeah, I don't know where that half.
**Shooper**: Came from, but I think it came from Jose.
**Shooper**: Yeah, no, yeah, I think, I think the confusion came from on Jose's end.
**Shooper**: So we got it straightened out and yeah, he's looking into it and trying.
**Crusin**: To get that, get that ordered.
**Brandon.robbins**: Okay.
**Crusin**: Yeah, we need that for.
**Crusin**: There's two pieces that still need air.
**Crusin**: The KSOPs for the dramatic sorter and then the right angle transfer for the B mod rts.
**Shooper**: Okay.
**Blake.robbins**: Yep.
**Crusin**: And we need to.
**Crusin**: To test those out here early next week, so.
**Shooper**: Okay.
**Shooper**: So do we want to.
**Shooper**: I mean, if need be, can we look at POP possibly running some temporary line to it?
**Crusin**: We might have to if we can't pull it in.
**Shooper**: Right.
**Blake.robbins**: Yeah.
**Crusin**: I think Mike said he could run a temporary line to the B mod sky scanner, but not the case stock.
**Shooper**: Okay.
**Blake.robbins**: Yeah.
**Shooper**: I mean, we could try to get some poly tube or something, you know, shipped down there for some temporary line.
**Crusin**: They might have some of that here too.
**Shooper**: Okay.
**Blake.robbins**: Yep.
**Crusin**: The other piece was the.
**Crusin**: All that header.
**Crusin**: Header steel material.
**Crusin**: So.
**Blake.robbins**: Yeah.
**Shooper**: And Brandon's currently working on that, getting that put together, so.
**Brandon.robbins**: Yeah.
**Blake.robbins**: Yep.
**Crusin**: Any idea when we'll have a.
**Crusin**: An ETA for that?
**Crusin**: We went to install a decline.
**Crusin**: Excuse me.
**Crusin**: An incline today and realized we didn't have any of the sequel.
**Crusin**: Actually, I think it was the.
**Crusin**: Some square that he was missing, But.
**Shooper**: I had to get with Brandon in the morning and get an update on that.
**Shooper**: He had to leave this afternoon, so.
**Brandon.robbins**: Yeah.
**Blake.robbins**: What are we missing, Drew?
**Crusin**: There was some c clamps and.
**Brandon.robbins**: Yeah, but the other thing was.
**Brandon.robbins**: We can go over it later.
**Brandon.robbins**: I just.
**Blake.robbins**: I hadn't heard about that.
**Crusin**: Yeah, we didn't realize that until yesterday, but it's for conveyor that's going to be going live now.
**Crusin**: 9:15.
**Crusin**: So it's not quite as urgent, but we wanted to start installing it now.
**Crusin**: We've basically finished up mechanically every.
**Crusin**: I mean, all the conveyors in.
**Crusin**: That's going to be going live 8:11.
**Crusin**: There's just a.
**Crusin**: One more area that we need to repair mechanically for the empty tote line coming back to D camp.
**Brandon.robbins**: But we.
**Crusin**: Can'T do that until Friday.
**Crusin**: All right, we'll stay close to those two items.
**Crusin**: Brett, anything else?
**Shooper**: Nope, not on my end.
**Crusin**: All right, thanks.
**Blake.robbins**: Yep.
**Shooper**: Thank you.
**Crusin**: Go ahead and drop.
**Brandon.robbins**: All right, thank you.
**Crusin**: I'm going to skip over lei for now.
**Crusin**: I know Blake is supporting domatic volume testing right now, but do we have anything for LAI that I need to.
**Crusin**: To bring up with him later?
**Crusin**: Oh, Brandon, I didn't see.
**Crusin**: You're on.
**Blake.robbins**: Good afternoon, sir.
**Crusin**: Afternoon.
**Crusin**: Anything you've got?
**Crusin**: I know Blake's been pretty.
**Crusin**: Pretty engaged with everything going on, but.
**Rhall**: Yeah, we.
**Rhall**: He's pretty engaged.
**Rhall**: He's leading the charge and getting the team ready for next week.
**Crusin**: Do you know who's coming down?
**Crusin**: I know there's a pretty big group.
**Rhall**: I. I don't know that we have a long Enough meeting to go through that list, but there's a lot.
**Rhall**: Blake will be there, so that will be the main contact.
**Brandon.robbins**: Great.
**Crusin**: Steve's going to be there Monday and I know we need to finish up some training, some testing with Alta on the DMS conveyor as well as the OPEX outbound.
**Crusin**: So he said you'd have somebody be.
**Crusin**: It would be able to support that.
**Blake.robbins**: Yeah, we'll.
**Rhall**: We'll be traveling Monday.
**Rhall**: I think there's seven people going down Monday and seven going down Tuesday.
**Brandon.robbins**: Oh, wow.
**Brandon.robbins**: Okay.
**Rhall**: Blake will be.
**Rhall**: I think Blake's on the Tuesday trip, but I think Jeremy will be there on Monday.
**Rhall**: I'm going through my list right now.
**Brandon.robbins**: Right.
**Crusin**: Anything else you want to go over?
**Rhall**: No, sir, I'm good.
**Rhall**: Unless you have anything for me.
**Crusin**: No, I wouldn't mind getting those.
**Crusin**: If you have the list, if you could email it to me.
**Rhall**: But I'm gonna let Blake finalize it and then we can send it out.
**Rhall**: It is changing since there is some me moving parts, but yes, we can send that over.
**Crusin**: Yeah, that's fine.
**Crusin**: If I get it Friday, that works.
**Brandon.robbins**: Yep.
**Brandon.robbins**: Good.
**Crusin**: Thanks, Brandon.
**Rhall**: Thank you, sir.
**Crusin**: Moving to Hytrol then.
**Crusin**: Preston, are you on the call here?
**Ataylor**: Yes, sir.
**Brandon.robbins**: Great.
**Crusin**: I just want to go over ship dates here first.
**Crusin**: So the ship sorter downline, we have a.
**Crusin**: The date from 8:1 to 8:6 out there.
**Crusin**: Do you have a more firm date you're working towards now.
**Ataylor**: At this time?
**Ataylor**: No, right now we've got a couple of material that's being outsourced, so that's why I have that date range from 8.1 to 86.
**Ataylor**: It could fluctuate anywhere in between there.
**Brandon.robbins**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: It's just as material is received on our end, that's when we can work on it.
**Crusin**: Gotcha.
**Crusin**: We did end up shifting that installation back a couple weeks, so we won't be installing it until a little later in August.
**Brandon.robbins**: Okay.
**Crusin**: But the decant work tables is the more critical item and I think we had that Same range from 8.1 to 8 6.
**Brandon.robbins**: Okay.
**Brandon.robbins**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: If we can.
**Ataylor**: I'll push this out.
**Ataylor**: If we can prioritize that, then we'll focus on that first.
**Brandon.robbins**: Okay.
**Crusin**: Do you have the.
**Crusin**: Do you need any information on those work tables?
**Crusin**: That phone number?
**Ataylor**: Yes, if you have it.
**Ataylor**: If not, then I can reach out to John Kirby.
**Crusin**: I know I've sent it to you before, so I'll just dig that email up and.
**Brandon.robbins**: Okay, you send it.
**Crusin**: But we'd really.
**Crusin**: I mean, we need to get it shipped out early next week.
**Brandon.robbins**: Okay.
**Crusin**: I Did see your email for the suresort conveyor that was pulled into 10 6, so that was a big help.
**Crusin**: Thank you for that.
**Ataylor**: Yes, sir.
**Crusin**: And then the inspection, I was just waiting on timing for when that service technician was going to be showing up to site.
**Crusin**: Believe.
**Crusin**: Do you have that information now?
**Ataylor**: Yes.
**Ataylor**: So I do have the tech that's.
**Ataylor**: That's ready.
**Ataylor**: I've got a couple questions from his supervisor.
**Ataylor**: So he can't travel until Thursday, so pretty much be there all day Friday.
**Ataylor**: To review.
**Ataylor**: He's saying that he may need more than eight hours.
**Ataylor**: So he's just, he's wondering what's the allowable work times?
**Ataylor**: Um, is there a work window for when he needs to be there Friday?
**Crusin**: No, I mean, I'd like to start probably as early as he can.
**Crusin**: So 7am to 5.
**Brandon.robbins**: Okay.
**Brandon.robbins**: All right.
**Ataylor**: And then just side contact info I can give it.
**Ataylor**: Give him yours.
**Ataylor**: But if you're going to be leaving, he just needs somebody that can assist him while he's there on Friday.
**Brandon.robbins**: Okay.
**Crusin**: Yeah, I'll give.
**Crusin**: Brian Pulver is going to be here from the Vargo side, I think as we talked.
**Crusin**: And then Lonnie Thomas is the E and F manager here who is going to go do a walk through with him.
**Brandon.robbins**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: I'll just need.
**Ataylor**: I'll just need their emails and their phone numbers and.
**Ataylor**: And I'll.
**Ataylor**: I'll give those to you as well for our tech.
**Brandon.robbins**: Okay.
**Crusin**: I'm going to attach Lonnie on the email.
**Brandon.robbins**: Okay.
**Crusin**: Anything else that you have, Preston?
**Ataylor**: Nope, not this time.
**Crusin**: Hey, Preston, I dug up the EPO.
**Bpulfer**: Number for the DCAT work tables.
**Brandon.robbins**: It's okay.
**Brandon.robbins**: 1, 7, 7Z68.
**Brandon.robbins**: Okay.
**Brandon.robbins**: All right.
**Ataylor**: And is that the only one that you've got, Steve?
**Brandon.robbins**: Correct.
**Brandon.robbins**: Okay.
**Brandon.robbins**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: So that one, fortunately, is not being outsourced, so I'll just push that on production to make sure that we hit that.
**Ataylor**: That early ship date.
**Brandon.robbins**: Okay, good.
**Crusin**: Yeah, keep me updated.
**Crusin**: If we can ship it out Friday, that would be good.
**Brandon.robbins**: Yes, sir.
**Crusin**: And I need to talk to Juan about the training.
**Crusin**: I still don't have confirmation if Walter wants to do a formal classroom setting training and talking to some of their maintenance folks, it seems like it would be something that's valuable, so might end up doing that.
**Ataylor**: Is that all he's waiting on on your end?
**Crusin**: Yeah, he just.
**Crusin**: I've got the quote and everything.
**Crusin**: I just need to give him confirmation and set up some dates.
**Brandon.robbins**: Okay.
**Brandon.robbins**: All right.
**Crusin**: Moving to Alito.
**Crusin**: I know AJ is actually flying down to Dallas this afternoon, so I don't think he, he's on this call but does anybody else need anything from Alito?
**Crusin**: Steve Hooper, I'm going to talk to him tomorrow.
**Crusin**: But he had said the B mod lighting and sprinklers were complete in our call last week but they've still got a decent amount of work there so they're coming in.
**Crusin**: He said later this week to try to finish that up.
**Crusin**: But the other thing I've got him or he's looking into is the fire alarm interlock for the OPEX panels and the pneumatic panels.
**Crusin**: So I can keep you updated with that or let you know if we need anything.
**Brandon.robbins**: Steve.
**Brandon.robbins**: Okay.
**Crusin**: Austin is supporting pneumatic testing so he's not on.
**Crusin**: We have Justin from OPEX or Jennifer.
**David.douglas**: Yep, you've got me.
**Brandon.robbins**: Great.
**Crusin**: Do you have an update for today?
**Crusin**: I know you're working on the aisle six testing.
**David.douglas**: Yeah, just aisle six testing.
**David.douglas**: Tow loading is complete and then we're still tracking to receive the.
**David.douglas**: I believe it's going to be 24ibots.
**Brandon.robbins**: Next week and then for our, I.
**David.douglas**: Guess some emails that we threw back and forth last week, we will balance out the IBOX between all six aisles.
**David.douglas**: And the update that I have from.
**Brandon.robbins**: Production is I believe the remaining will ship at the end of August.
**Crusin**: Yeah, last week of August.
**David.douglas**: And then how long does it take.
**Crusin**: To get those eye bots into the system?
**Crusin**: Is there a run in process or.
**Crusin**: Pretty quick.
**David.douglas**: I mean it's, it's, it's not.
**David.douglas**: It should.
**David.douglas**: I want to say it could be done in a couple of days.
**David.douglas**: I mean it may be even a.
**Brandon.robbins**: Little bit quicker than that, but.
**David.douglas**: I can try.
**David.douglas**: I can get you a timeline if that helps.
**Crusin**: I just want to get confirmation that come 811 we'll have that second delivery of iBots or whatever's coming in next week.
**Crusin**: Those will all be in production.
**Brandon.robbins**: Oh yeah.
**Brandon.robbins**: Yep.
**Brandon.robbins**: Okay, good.
**David.douglas**: We'll have them in there.
**David.douglas**: Only thing other than that super user training that seems to be going well.
**David.douglas**: From the update that I got from the team last night.
**Crusin**: The last item I've got is the warranty dates.
**Crusin**: I think your one year support starts at 8 11.
**Brandon.robbins**: Correct.
**David.douglas**: Jen, can you help confirm that?
**Crusin**: Yeah, I'm looking that up right now.
**David.douglas**: Is that test, I can't remember if that's completion of throughput or liability or.
**Bretton.basford**: Yeah, on the contract it.
**Brandon.robbins**: Let me check that real quick.
**Bretton.basford**: Yeah, after throughput liability and the field labeling which we did in June then then the warranty starts after throughput reliability which is around the same time anyway.
**Bretton.basford**: Could be close to 8.
**Crusin**: 11.
**Bretton.basford**: Anyway.
**Crusin**: I'm sorry, say that again, the last part.
**Crusin**: Close to 11.
**Bretton.basford**: Yeah, I believe it'll be around the same time is what you're asking.
**Bretton.basford**: The criteria is throughput reliability.
**Brandon.robbins**: But.
**Crusin**: Do you mind sending.
**Crusin**: Jen, if you could send me that date for when that warranty is over.
**Brandon.robbins**: Okay, that would be helpful.
**David.douglas**: Hey, Drew, I've got one more question for Vincent.
**David.douglas**: Vincent, I know we had done another scan or conducted another scan last week at the site.
**David.douglas**: Dwayne had provided some information, I believe, to you and Angus.
**David.douglas**: Have you heard anything back from Angus?
**David.douglas**: I don't recall seeing an email.
**Austin.liebler**: I have not seen Gord respond.
**Austin.liebler**: But we were quite busy with the Domatic shuttle last week, so maybe, maybe it just kind of slipped through.
**Austin.liebler**: But I can follow up with Gord.
**Brandon.robbins**: Is there.
**Austin.liebler**: Is there additional action there that we need to take?
**Austin.liebler**: I haven't read the review.
**David.douglas**: Yeah, it sounded like it.
**David.douglas**: I would have to go back and reread the review there and if we need to get wind up on a separate call at some point to chat about it, we can.
**David.douglas**: I think just.
**David.douglas**: The concern is there's still quite a bit of chatter that Dwayne was seeing and you know, we have 57 of the IBOTs in, but we'll basically be loading that amount again and could see some potential issues, so.
**Brandon.robbins**: Okay.
**Brandon.robbins**: Okay.
**Austin.liebler**: Yeah, let's set up a call with Gord to discuss that.
**Austin.liebler**: Do you.
**Austin.liebler**: Is it more precautionary or do you guys foresee like a potential issue?
**Austin.liebler**: Just trying to gauge like the level of concern.
**David.douglas**: I guess that's going to be a Dwayne question, Vincent.
**David.douglas**: I don't know, but I can confidently.
**Brandon.robbins**: Give you an answer to that.
**Brandon.robbins**: Okay, yep, set something up.
**Crusin**: All right, moving to the sure sort then.
**Crusin**: Leo, do you have an update this week?
**Crusin**: Anything you need?
**Kschepers**: No, nothing I need, thank you.
**Kschepers**: And then.
**Kschepers**: Yeah, sorry for the delay.
**Kschepers**: I did get the power and data requirements information over to you earlier today.
**Crusin**: Yeah, I saw that and ported it off to Bobby.
**Crusin**: I didn't take it quick or a good look at it.
**Crusin**: So I don't know if that had information for the test cage, if there's additional power and data that's needed for that or the existing what's run for the perfect pick will be adequate for that.
**Kschepers**: Yeah, I had added some notes from the RSM for the requested cage power and data, so if you could take a look at that.
**Kschepers**: Sounds like he is asking for some additional power in.
**Kschepers**: In the cage.
**Brandon.robbins**: Okay.
**Crusin**: Just power though.
**Kschepers**: I don't have it right in front of.
**Kschepers**: See, I Believe it was power.
**Kschepers**: He also wanted to confirm the.
**Bpulfer**: Breaker.
**Kschepers**: Amperage just to make sure when we're running tools for both machines that it doesn't trip the breakers and then.
**Brandon.robbins**: See.
**Kschepers**: If I can find that.
**Crusin**: Okay.
**Crusin**: Yeah, I see your email here this afternoon.
**Kschepers**: And then he asked for another.
**Kschepers**: Well, I'm not sure exactly what's in the cage currently, but he asked for two Ethernet drops.
**Brandon.robbins**: All right.
**Crusin**: Justin, do you know if we're gonna need to add those two in addition to what you have?
**David.douglas**: I need to follow up with the technician on site to get a true understanding of everything that is in there currently.
**David.douglas**: Right.
**David.douglas**: And I can get back to you.
**Crusin**: All right, thanks.
**Crusin**: I know Alta wants to have the power and data requirements for the new sure sort by end of this week.
**Crusin**: So if we can just figure out what additionals needed for.
**Crusin**: For the test cage on that, that.
**Brandon.robbins**: Would be.
**Crusin**: The last thing we need.
**David.douglas**: That sounds good.
**Crusin**: Okay, thanks Leo.
**Crusin**: We have anyone on from Unarco?
**Crusin**: Dustin, I see you're on.
**David.douglas**: Yeah, I'm on.
**Crusin**: I know I sent an email giving approval on the change orders that we had out there last week, but I think you need to get a signed change order just for me to fill out that form.
**Bpulfer**: Right, yeah, actually I looked at them just now and they're actually all signed.
**Bpulfer**: You already did sign them.
**Brandon.robbins**: Okay.
**Bpulfer**: We did have a question about the change order number eight that we were discussing.
**Crusin**: Remind me what that one was?
**Crusin**: The tarps?
**Bpulfer**: Yeah, it was for the retarping.
**Bpulfer**: It was for 1675.
**Bpulfer**: For the re tarping.
**Bpulfer**: I can drop that down to 1,000.
**Brandon.robbins**: That will help.
**Crusin**: Yeah, that would be good because that's not.
**Crusin**: I don't.
**Crusin**: Not something I want to go back to Alta on.
**Crusin**: So if we can just split that.
**Brandon.robbins**: That would be good.
**Bpulfer**: Okay, I will change that one and send it over for your signature.
**Bpulfer**: And then I just wanted to follow up.
**Bpulfer**: Are we still looking at having that shelving back on site, shipping on the 15th to have the crew start on the 18th?
**Brandon.robbins**: Correct.
**Brandon.robbins**: Okay.
**Crusin**: Yeah.
**Crusin**: So I think I was just waiting back on the.
**Crusin**: To hear back on the.
**Crusin**: The CO number for the remove on those shelves?
**Bpulfer**: Yeah, I'm still waiting to hear back from Fred.
**David.douglas**: He's discussing that.
**Bpulfer**: And then we're looking at.
**Bpulfer**: Also remember the conversation we had back in May about the additional time for the install on that one IO.
**Brandon.robbins**: Okay.
**David.douglas**: Other than that, that's all I have on my end.
**Crusin**: Great, thank you.
**Crusin**: All right, well, we're getting pretty close.
**Crusin**: Any other call outs or concerns risks before we go today?
**Brandon.robbins**: Yeah, great.
**Crusin**: Thanks everyone.
**Brandon.robbins**: Thank you, Sa.
