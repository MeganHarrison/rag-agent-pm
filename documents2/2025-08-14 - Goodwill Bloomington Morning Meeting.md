## Transcript
**Jcurtin**: Count it.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so I guess we're gonna mark up the grading plan.
**Jcurtin**: Okay, just heads up, this is not my njepson.
**Jdawson**: Oh, yeah.
**Jdawson**: I think Jesse jdawson puts the njepson on there.
**Jcurtin**: Oh, gotcha.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, makes sense because I don't think they're going to be able to make all these.
**Jcurtin**: So he can stay in tune.
**Jcurtin**: What's.
**Jcurtin**: What's going on?
**Jdawson**: He says how much does he want to raise his check?
**Bclymer**: 1 brick height, not like the width of it, which I gotta like.
**Jdawson**: Go eight inches or.
**Jdawson**: Well, a brick.
**Jdawson**: Not a cmu.
**Jdawson**: A brick.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, just the width of a.
**Bclymer**: Of a.
**Bclymer**: Of a brick.
**Bclymer**: Like the depth of a brick.
**Bclymer**: I gotta pull tape on it and know exactly to be able to tell.
**Bclymer**: You haven't.
**Bclymer**: I haven't got away from the computer yet.
**Jdawson**: Looks like they're two and a quarter inches.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: Did he.
**Jdawson**: Did he say how far he wanted to cut this back?
**Bclymer**: How far you want to cut?
**Bclymer**: Well, back.
**Jcurtin**: Wasn't this our.
**Jcurtin**: Isn't this marked up on the email Jesse sent yesterday?
**Bclymer**: Well, see, he.
**Bclymer**: He's.
**Bclymer**: He's proposing now to not cut back any asphalt as long as we can do a mushroom type of a slope around the bottom of these columns.
**Jcurtin**: Oh, so he's talking a way less scope than raising the inlet and removing the additional asphalt.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So still.
**Bclymer**: Still raise the inlet, but then instead of doing like a.
**Bclymer**: A square base at the bottom of these columns, basically just doing like a.
**Bclymer**: Like a.
**Bclymer**: Like a mushroom type and then basically rain come down.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, because he's talking in that.
**Jcurtin**: In the one he sent yesterday, he's talking about raising it three inches, and now this is two and a quarter.
**Jcurtin**: And then you're talking like.
**Jcurtin**: So bring it up to that.
**Jcurtin**: Is that what you're saying?
**Bclymer**: Raising the inlet up two and a quarter and then the mushroom that he was.
**Jcurtin**: Sorry, can you put the inlet picture back up?
**Jcurtin**: Is that right there what you're talking about?
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, that.
**Jcurtin**: I see what you mean now because.
**Jcurtin**: See the elevation of that existing asphalt.
**Jcurtin**: Sorry, I follow you now.
**Jcurtin**: Can you get going?
**Bclymer**: So just not cut back any asphalt.
**Bclymer**: Raise the inlet two and a quarter, start the concrete base at the top of those bolts, and then a must a mushroom slope down around the whole entire footing and cover the whole thing.
**Bclymer**: And everything will slope correctly and grade correctly into the drain.
**Bclymer**: And everything work out.
**Bclymer**: And everything work out.
**Bclymer**: Great.
**Jcurtin**: Okay, so who do we got to get approval from?
**Jcurtin**: Jesse jdawson?
**Bclymer**: Well, with us now doing framing around the base of these columns.
**Bclymer**: I mean, now it's gonna look really funky, but maybe still Doing the mushroom base, but then put a square cube at the top of that mushroom base so that the framers can shoot their framing down on it.
**Bclymer**: So it's gonna look like.
**Bclymer**: Like a mushroom base with a square box at the top.
**Bclymer**: Can you.
**Jcurtin**: Can you loosely sketch what you're talking about?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So, I mean, where.
**Bclymer**: Where he's showing.
**Bclymer**: Where Nick is showing that box, where Nick is showing this picture right now, and it has it pointed to the concrete.
**Bclymer**: It shows him just doing a square box around those anchor bolts.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Now what the concrete guy has proposed, instead of doing a square box, that bottom leg that the concrete arrow is like where it's pointing to, taking that out, kicking that out to the left, and basically creating a mushroom.
**Bclymer**: Everything slopes down.
**Jcurtin**: Oh, so it's more of like a tape.
**Jcurtin**: Like a taper.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: Gotcha.
**Bclymer**: But I can't.
**Bclymer**: We.
**Bclymer**: We can't have.
**Bclymer**: I mean, unless I tell him.
**Bclymer**: Hey, can you start it out as a.
**Bclymer**: As like a.
**Bclymer**: Like create me a ledge at the top, come out 4 inches so I can get a track of framing on it and then slow it down.
**Jcurtin**: I'm making something real quick.
**Jcurtin**: Bluebeam is your friend.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Hey, I got you on speaker with Jesse and Nick.
**Bclymer**: I know.
**Bclymer**: We.
**Bclymer**: We just reviewed the bottom of those columns, potentially doing like a.
**Bclymer**: A mushroom type where it slopes down.
**Bclymer**: Cover the whole footing.
**Bclymer**: Would you be able to.
**Bclymer**: So we actually gonna have to do.
**Bclymer**: We're gonna have to actually frame around those columns.
**Bclymer**: And then we're gonna.
**Bclymer**: And then do some dense glass.
**Bclymer**: And then the EFIs be on that so that they have a flat surface at the bottom.
**Bclymer**: What do you think about like, at least coming before.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Amen.
**Bclymer**: Perfect.
**Bclymer**: Perfect.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: Awesome.
**Bclymer**: Awesome.
**Bclymer**: Well then.
**Bclymer**: Sweet.
**Bclymer**: Well, we'll.
**Bclymer**: I'll let them know they can hear you're on speaker.
**Bclymer**: And then we're sketching up about you raising the inlet two and a quarter up.
**Bclymer**: And then next we'll.
**Bclymer**: I'm just go over pricing and stuff.
**Bclymer**: If we were able to get this approved today, would you.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Sweet.
**Bclymer**: Sweet.
**Bclymer**: I'll be in touch with you again today.
**Bclymer**: About.
**Bclymer**: We're still trying to figure out maybe a plan on bringing your Georgia buggies in through the front door, because the block.
**Bclymer**: The mason said that they're not going to be done until August 27th.
**Bclymer**: Worst case scenario.
**Bclymer**: So what's.
**Bclymer**: What's that look like?
**Bclymer**: If we get ram board down, would you think we'd also maybe plywood to really protect bringing that stuff in through the front door?
**Jcurtin**: Jackie, can you call him after this meeting so we can get through this stuff.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: Just call me back when you're ready.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: As far as getting the top leveler.
**Bclymer**: Formed in there and that board.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: Hey, Jack.
**Jcurtin**: Okay, please, please call him back when you.
**Jcurtin**: After the meeting.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: Thanks, bclymer.
**Bclymer**: All right, I'll call you back.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, we can't hear him, man.
**Jcurtin**: If you want to invite him to the meeting, that's totally cool, but, man, we can't sit here on the call like that waiting for that.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I mean, well, he is 68 years old.
**Bclymer**: He doesn't have teams.
**Bclymer**: Doesn't don't even know what it is.
**Bclymer**: So we'd have.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, but you can talk to him after the call.
**Jcurtin**: That's cool.
**Jcurtin**: We just got to get through this because it sounds like we really got to get moving.
**Jcurtin**: There's an urgency on this, isn't there?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I mean, definitely.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: So take a look at what I just sent in the chat.
**Jcurtin**: Is that what you're talking about for the mushroom?
**Jremillard**: Huh?
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Which he just.
**Bclymer**: He just agreed that that's what he's going to do, so that's all good.
**Jcurtin**: So that would be four inches further out.
**Jcurtin**: Like that bottom red line would be 4 inches?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I mean, it would.
**Bclymer**: It would be like a gradual slope.
**Bclymer**: It wouldn't be like.
**Jcurtin**: Oh, yeah, I know.
**Jcurtin**: It's not going to be abrupt because.
**Jcurtin**: Okay, so that's.
**Jcurtin**: And then that gives the framers something to put, what, their hat channel and dense glass, an ethos and all that fun stuff on.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: What else do we need to figure out for this?
**Jcurtin**: He said he wants to raise that inlet two and a quarter inches.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, that's it.
**Bclymer**: The other thing we need to figure out for this area is he needs.
**Bclymer**: He needs approval on pricing.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Which.
**Jcurtin**: So did he give you his pricing for this yet?
**Bclymer**: He did for four to core drill.
**Bclymer**: He said only four to five holes.
**Bclymer**: He said between 1200-1500 to drill the holes?
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: Because now they're in concrete versus before they were in dirt.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, some of them were going to be in dirt, Some of them are going to be in concrete.
**Jcurtin**: So how much was it before they were all in dirt?
**Bclymer**: He.
**Bclymer**: He thought he had to do all of them, but it was 3, 200.
**Bclymer**: And he was like, actually, I don't need to cordur all of them.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: So he.
**Jcurtin**: Okay, so this is kind of like the credit amount that he's charging us to do these ones now.
**Jcurtin**: It used to be 3, $200, but nobody's seen it.
**Jcurtin**: It's a lot less work.
**Jcurtin**: So it's only 12 to 1500.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Jcurtin**: Okay, cool.
**Bclymer**: Next.
**Bclymer**: Next price is he's got four bollards that we need him to install around the handicap ramp on that north west corner.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And that he's going to do surface mounted pipe Ballards instead of the ones that we have on the east side of the building around the canopy because that's all.
**Bclymer**: So instead of core drilling four more around that ramp, we had him just do surface mounted ones.
**Bclymer**: And he said 11:40.
**Jdawson**: And does he know that's in his contract, Jack?
**Bclymer**: He expressed to me that that that was.
**Jremillard**: Added.
**Bclymer**: Him.
**Bclymer**: It was added to his contract to do.
**Bclymer**: To install more bollards back there.
**Bclymer**: It.
**Bclymer**: It's a.
**Bclymer**: It's.
**Bclymer**: I may have to be a conversation between y' all because he's saying that it wasn't included in there.
**Bclymer**: That he didn't give a.
**Bclymer**: A price to cordial four.
**Bclymer**: It was just a price of what, four more bars.
**Jdawson**: Hey Jack, what's work on the change orders later.
**Jdawson**: This design right here though.
**Jcurtin**: Did.
**Jdawson**: Did he say how he's going to slope this right here?
**Bclymer**: What the bottom of the columns?
**Jdawson**: Well, the, the sloping.
**Jdawson**: There's like a.
**Jdawson**: A trough right here.
**Jdawson**: Like did he say how he's going to slope it from here to here?
**Jdawson**: Is he going to make like a, a hump right here to raise it because we raised the drain?
**Bclymer**: No, that raising the drain is not going to make it.
**Bclymer**: It's not going to affect anything else like where he has to modify.
**Bclymer**: Like raising the drain is not going to negatively affect the sloping of the asphalt to where like he has to bring up asphalt or anything.
**Jremillard**: Brian with Kim Lee Horn just called me.
**Jremillard**: He's sending a plan with some spot elevations.
**Jremillard**: That is a concern because it's basically flat between those two inlets and it's falling from the middle gradually a little bit to each of those boxes.
**Jremillard**: So if you just raise up the one side halfway through, but not at the crown, it is possible it'll hold water there.
**Jremillard**: So what he's sending.
**Jremillard**: He said if we follow it, he's fairly certain that will work.
**Jremillard**: So.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: When that plan comes through, he said he's almost done.
**Jremillard**: That's what you should use to put all this in.
**Jremillard**: Get it to the site guy.
**Jremillard**: Make it happen.
**Jcurtin**: Good.
**Jcurtin**: Thank you.
**Jdawson**: We're good on this then?
**Jdawson**: Well, once we get that plan from.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, let's.
**Jcurtin**: Let's get on another call and we get that plan and go.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: And then what if we got to talk about the buggies too before we get off this call.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: Because Jesse, I'm sure you'll say it, but them things running over our brand new thresholds for the auto doors, we'll trash them polished concrete in there, which will make a mess you.
**Jremillard**: And then this date of 27 August, it's two weeks from now for the mason to be done.
**Jremillard**: Like what's happening?
**Jcurtin**: Did you catch that part that he talked about on the schedule was chipping out that fully crowded area, Nick.
**Jcurtin**: Jack.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, he said that that corner right there with it being a fully grounded area is going to take longer than he expected.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, he was saying Wednesday.
**Jremillard**: Can we not hire Jesse?
**Jremillard**: Would it help if we hired a saw cutting company to come in and.
**Jremillard**: And just saw cut that out, tooth it in or you know, saw cut out that block for them so they can just go in and infill it or they can't even set their beam across that opening so they can block up above it.
**Jcurtin**: Correct.
**Jcurtin**: They can't set the beam until they get that all cut out notched.
**Jremillard**: And so I guess if that's going to take them a week, why, you know, pay him to take their scaffolding down so they can run that dirt and concrete up in there?
**Jremillard**: Because couldn't the concrete guy finish in the week it takes him to fix that corner and then he can just drop back and finish his block?
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, yeah, that was the original conversation.
**Jcurtin**: It sounds like this immovable scaffold just needs to go.
**Jcurtin**: Can you get a price from them on that, Jack, to take it down and let's talk about if it'll work.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: So I mean this needs to be a changeover.
**Jremillard**: We'll talk to Goodwill about that corner.
**Jremillard**: We weren't supposed to rebuild it.
**Jremillard**: It was supposed to be structurally sound and it isn't.
**Jremillard**: So if it costs a little bit to take the scaffold down, but it makes no sense.
**Jremillard**: And you correct me if I'm wrong, Jesse, but to leave that in there and then mess up our finished area by truck and through it.
**Jcurtin**: 3 grand to take down scaffolding is cheaper than 10 grand to fix a concrete polished floor.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: Putting down plywood and Masonite, all that other shit.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, that alone is going to be costly.
**Jcurtin**: That's what they were talking about trying to find another entrance with this.
**Jcurtin**: But he's saying he can only go up so far in that back man door and they could wheelbarrow it in from there in that area.
**Jcurtin**: But yeah, giving a cost to take that scaffold down is going to be ideal.
**Jcurtin**: So they can have the loading dock.
**Jremillard**: I mean, Jack, are we accurate that scaffold is going to sit there basically blocking off the entrance for a week while they fix the corner.
**Bclymer**: It is.
**Jremillard**: And not be used.
**Jremillard**: Take it down.
**Jremillard**: It'll take their guy half a day.
**Jremillard**: Maybe they don't have to take it all down.
**Jremillard**: Leave the corner up so they can work on the corner.
**Jremillard**: He just needs to get by him.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, they may have to install some scaffolding backup to tooth it in up, up at the top, you know, pie.
**Bclymer**: So I mean.
**Jremillard**: I mean, aren't these a 6 foot by 8 foot buck or 6 foot wide?
**Jremillard**: I mean, all this capital doesn't have to be there for them to work on the corner.
**Bclymer**: No, I could just tell them to, you know, condense it to just that corner and I'll come around to you.
**Bclymer**: I'll come around on the left side of you.
**Bclymer**: And then, you know, by the time you finish that corner, we'll have everything inside the building and then you can.
**Jremillard**: Then I hope you have it poured by then.
**Jremillard**: Like, is it a day to put dirt in, prep the slab and pour it.
**Jremillard**: Like, they should be done this like by the end of next week.
**Jremillard**: They're done with the concrete.
**Jremillard**: He's done with the corner.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: All right, I've said my piece.
**Jremillard**: Mute myself.
**Jcurtin**: Thank you.
**Jcurtin**: Okay, so does that all make sense on what needs to be done for that, Jack?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: Okay, can you circle back today and let me know what they say when you talk to them about it?
**Jcurtin**: And I would also confirm with the concrete guy what kind of width and space he needs to get those buggies because it's not much more than an open.
**Jcurtin**: A door opening.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: And then we have the plan for the delineating the area for the tco, right, Nick?
**Jdawson**: And that's when we need to.
**Jdawson**: We need to see where the schedule is at with the canopy and see if we can.
**Jdawson**: If that can be.
**Jdawson**: If it's going to work out with Goodwill's move in day.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, we need that schedule updated.
**Jcurtin**: How are you doing on that, Jack?
**Bclymer**: Well, how am I doing updating the schedule?
**Jcurtin**: Remember admitig on Tuesday you were going to send me just your.
**Jcurtin**: The current version.
**Jcurtin**: You're going to change the date.
**Jcurtin**: So I knew which one I had.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I mean, what I was going to send you was just going to be a rough sketch before we could get guys to guarantee dates today.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: From.
**Bclymer**: From the note.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, I just need to see what.
**Jcurtin**: What the current one is, and then I'll help you with that stuff.
**Jcurtin**: And Contacting people and making sure everyone knows their stuff.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So, I mean, do.
**Bclymer**: Do you want.
**Bclymer**: Do you want the one.
**Bclymer**: Do you.
**Bclymer**: Do you want the version that I have, like, without everybody's guaranteed dates from today's meeting or.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, I want the current one from today with the unknowns in it.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, you don't have to make it complete.
**Jcurtin**: Like, I need to see where the holes are.
**Jcurtin**: So we need.
**Jcurtin**: We know who we need to be talking to.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I mean, I have it open up right now.
**Bclymer**: Just send it to you right now.
**Jcurtin**: Thank you.
**Jcurtin**: And then, Nick, if you can keep going on that one that I asked you about earlier, just put your notes on it or if you want to circle up and we'll talk about it when we get that design.
**Jcurtin**: But we just got to make sure we know everything on there and we know what we need to look into and fix.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: So does anybody else have anything holding them up or they need help with?
**Bclymer**: You said we'll go over change order at a different time.
**Jdawson**: I'll go over that with them.
**Jdawson**: Just focus on the.
**Jdawson**: On the schedule.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, so go ahead.
**Bclymer**: So you do want me to have the wall pack situation.
**Bclymer**: Nick, you do want.
**Bclymer**: Kevin.
**Jdawson**: The demo guys, they removed the wires for the exterior lights, so we need to have the electrician rewire those.
**Jdawson**: And if you can give me that dimension for that gray jack, I need to get that ordered.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And did those pictures come through of the.
**Bclymer**: Of showing the bricks?
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Jcurtin**: Hollow.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Oh, yeah, I see your message saying yes.
**Jcurtin**: Those photos will work.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Jcurtin**: Perfect.
**Jdawson**: And I guess if you can send photos of the donation vestibule area.
**Jdawson**: You were saying there was an issue with the concrete and we need a wider threshold.
**Jdawson**: Possibly, yes.
**Jremillard**: Can you show Jesse a picture.
**Jremillard**: Picture of that?
**Jremillard**: I would think you can just.
**Jremillard**: You're not going to get a threshold wide enough for that.
**Jremillard**: They just need to infill that top of block.
**Jremillard**: But I. I don't know.
**Jremillard**: I. I don't know what else to do with it than that.
**Jremillard**: Jesse, if you take a look at it, it's.
**Jdawson**: And then also for the utility vault, so I guess the check valve that's in there, there's no check said, there's no label and there's no manufacturer on it.
**Jdawson**: So we.
**Jdawson**: We don't know if it's on the approved list.
**Jdawson**: Should.
**Jdawson**: Should we just have United order one that we know is on the approved list?
**Jdawson**: We don't.
**Jdawson**: We don't really know what gave those to order.
**Jdawson**: If we don't know what the check valve is.
**Jremillard**: If we got our number includes and providing a whole new assembly.
**Jremillard**: Nick just put a whole new assembly as long as it's approved, you know, did we submit that to someone to check out what the sub was providing?
**Jdawson**: He sent me cut sheets for the gate valves and today because I told him the plan that we plan on reusing the check valve.
**Jdawson**: But then today we found out there's no information on the check valve that's in there.
**Jdawson**: So I'll have them send me a submittal with the check valve and the gate valves.
**Jremillard**: Is what he submitted on the city's approved list of manufacturers.
**Jremillard**: I don't know if you're aware of this Jesse, but the existing backflow preventer vault from the for the city fire.
**Jdawson**: Line.
**Jremillard**: I think it's fire domestic possibly, but so it was built back whenever and at the time and it doesn't sound like it was built correctly anyways because it didn't have isolation valves on either side of the check valve so they couldn't test it.
**Jremillard**: So they're making us fix that problem.
**Jremillard**: But to do that now the vault's not big enough for the space they require on either side of a valve on either side of the check valve.
**Jremillard**: So we're making the vault bigger.
**Jremillard**: But initially they're like, well, you don't have to replace the check valve that's existing.
**Jremillard**: You just have to put valves on there.
**Jremillard**: Now I don't know how standard flanges are on a 6 inch pipe or a 6 inch check valve to where you know the bolt pattern.
**Jremillard**: You know, if their problem is they don't know what valve to put on to bolt to the existing.
**Jcurtin**: I just dealt with the same thing in Decatur, Georgia and it's, it's a.
**Jcurtin**: If it's the same thing, it's, it's a whole different valve system.
**Jcurtin**: And I had to put a new vault in because the like you said, nothing bolts up.
**Jcurtin**: It's the old stuff.
**Jcurtin**: So that one ended up being about half a million.
**Jremillard**: Poof.
**Jremillard**: Well, this is not nearly that bad.
**Jremillard**: But luckily we had, we had the sub price it and he included changing out the check valve.
**Jremillard**: So that's what I'm saying.
**Jremillard**: As long as it's a city approved check valve.
**Jremillard**: Just haven't get the whole assembly.
**Jremillard**: Oh yeah, just change the whole thing out, be done with it.
**Jcurtin**: Do you have, do you have a city engineer you're working with on that?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, the guy who's installing it, he's.
**Jdawson**: He works with the city and he knows the engineers.
**Jdawson**: Well we also, we have a list of approved assemblies and we'll just order something off that list.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: So Nick lets you and I have another meeting in a little bit.
**Jcurtin**: I'll catch up with you after I get.
**Jcurtin**: Because I got the unique meeting right now, but let's catch up and let's go through that and get that squared away, and then we'll take a look at the schedule and just let me check real quick.
**Jcurtin**: Okay?
**Jcurtin**: I have an hour open after the alleatogroup meeting, so I'll call you right around noon.
**Jcurtin**: Noon.
**Jcurtin**: And if you're at lunch, just tell me.
**Jcurtin**: We can catch up with you back.
**Jdawson**: Okay?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I can.
**Jdawson**: I can talk to you at noon.
**Jcurtin**: Okay, I'll give you a call.
**Jcurtin**: And then Jack, let me know if I can help with any of that stuff.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: Thanks, jdawson.
