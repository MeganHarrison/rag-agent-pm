## Transcript
**Jcurtin**: Hey, guys.
**Jdawson**: Hey, Jesse.
**Jdawson**: How are you doing today?
**Jcurtin**: Lovely.
**Jcurtin**: Yourself?
**Jdawson**: Doing fine.
**Jcurtin**: Jack.
**Jcurtin**: Are you with us?
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Jcurtin**: Cool.
**Jcurtin**: So how'd the schedule go?
**Jcurtin**: Jack?
**Jcurtin**: Hey.
**Jcurtin**: Hey, man.
**Jcurtin**: How'd the schedule go?
**Bclymer**: Great question.
**Bclymer**: Rick still has answers to give us.
**Jcurtin**: Aren't you writing it for him?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, but he won't guarantee anything until he comes out and talks to me.
**Jcurtin**: Did this guy show up yesterday?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, they started digging for the bollards, but they haven't said anything and they don't.
**Bclymer**: They didn't work like a late evening to make up for not being here all day.
**Bclymer**: They just basically dig the holes and then put the bollards in the hole and then they left.
**Bclymer**: And then also in the meantime they.
**Bclymer**: They hit some conduit.
**Bclymer**: So electrician is working on fixing that now.
**Jcurtin**: But pictures.
**Jcurtin**: Do you have pictures of that conduit?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: Please make sure those get uploaded into the drive.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jcurtin**: I'd also shoot out an email just to me and Nick.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, the electrician built one up.
**Bclymer**: I'll forward it to you.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: Now, so has Rick himself shown up yet or talked to you today?
**Bclymer**: No, I've called him and texted him in the last several hours.
**Bclymer**: I have not heard from him.
**Bclymer**: So his again.
**Bclymer**: Him and one of his foremans yesterday said that they feel confident.
**Jcurtin**: Well.
**Bclymer**: Just at the concrete underneath the canopy.
**Bclymer**: Getting that done by Monday at the latest.
**Jcurtin**: Doing.
**Bclymer**: Just doing the concrete apron.
**Bclymer**: Then they gave me an option of where I can shoot concrete.
**Jcurtin**: Okay, how does that.
**Jcurtin**: You're cutting in and out really bad.
**Bclymer**: Jack, can you hear me now?
**Jdawson**: I can, I can hear you.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: I don't know if it's my end or what.
**Jcurtin**: Sorry, Jack.
**Jcurtin**: Try it.
**Jcurtin**: Try again.
**Jcurtin**: I just.
**Jcurtin**: I lost you at.
**Jcurtin**: If there's going to be any schedule impact with them finishing that on Monday.
**Bclymer**: Can you hear me?
**Jcurtin**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: The big thing that is going to affect the schedule.
**Bclymer**: Let me share my screen.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: So with them not do.
**Bclymer**: If they were to not beat that until Monday, I was hoping that they were going to have the concrete done by Thursday and they were going to be focusing on asphalt on Friday and.
**Jcurtin**: Then I was going to be able like tomorrow.
**Jcurtin**: Thursday.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: And that's right now.
**Jcurtin**: Not even possible to achieve.
**Bclymer**: It doesn't look like it.
**Bclymer**: Because they're, they're, they're, they're.
**Bclymer**: His crew is not even here this morning because they have another pour on another job site.
**Jcurtin**: Holy.
**Jcurtin**: This guy is ridiculous.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And then his, his.
**Bclymer**: It's.
**Bclymer**: I'm trying not to throw his foreman under the bus because she probably shouldn't have showed me, Shared all this information with me.
**Bclymer**: But, yeah, they're not even certain that they can work this Saturday here because she had to remind him that they already had an obligation to be on a different job site on Friday.
**Bclymer**: That is kind of in the same situation as us.
**Bclymer**: It's some sort of, like, band room for a school, and they got to get it poured because they have a grand opening or something next week, so.
**Bclymer**: But Rick's not telling me all that.
**Bclymer**: He's just trying to blame and, like, bring up the past and point fingers.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: Okay, here's what we got to do on that.
**Jcurtin**: Uh, Nick, can you call this guy and get a straight answer out of him?
**Jcurtin**: And then if he doesn't give you what you want, let me know and then I'll start trying.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: So, yeah, the best approach for this is just kind of keep using different guys.
**Jcurtin**: Like if nickel hound him a little bit and see if he can get it out of him, and then I'll call him.
**Jcurtin**: Okay, so we have.
**Jcurtin**: So we have keep our options open on being able to get something out of this guy.
**Bclymer**: Yes, because if he doesn't pour that until Monday, that ruins my plan of framing and sheathing the columns on Friday.
**Bclymer**: And then the EFIS guy being able to wrap the columns in this over the weekend.
**Bclymer**: Because the EFIS guy is going to already be on the site wrapping EFIs around the new windows.
**Bclymer**: And then he asked.
**Bclymer**: It would be great that he could accomplish the EFIs around the columns and the EFIs around the windows in all this weekend in one trip.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: It also.
**Jcurtin**: Is your schedule out of date already because it's installed bollards.
**Jcurtin**: Did that start Monday?
**Bclymer**: So I have it five days.
**Bclymer**: Because last week he wouldn't give me exact days.
**Bclymer**: He just said it should all.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, he said that in the meeting, right?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: Because I remember even asking him.
**Bclymer**: And it's what I kind of told him yesterday.
**Bclymer**: I was like, look, as he tried to backpedal.
**Bclymer**: And it was like I said it would take a week, but I didn't mean like a straight week.
**Bclymer**: I meant like, you know, a day here, then two days there, then.
**Bclymer**: And I was like, no, because when I asked you when I can have.
**Bclymer**: Because I said originally I was going to have a framer finish up the dens glass on your concrete with a scissor lift.
**Bclymer**: And you told me probably Monday or Tuesday, maybe Friday at the best.
**Bclymer**: So I put Friday.
**Bclymer**: That's why it says Friday the 22nd columns and he was like, ah, no, no, no.
**Jcurtin**: You know, but yeah, because this guy can't be going alleatogroup on us.
**Jcurtin**: We don't care about what happened in the past.
**Jcurtin**: We care about what's happening right now.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: And that's what I try to get him away from.
**Bclymer**: If, like, we're not at a point of bo hangers and who's to blame, but, like, we gotta figure this out because.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: I mean, if it's.
**Jcurtin**: If anything was on us, it's no longer.
**Jcurtin**: He no longer has any leverage because he's just been blowing us off, so not giving us straight answers and blowing us up.
**Jcurtin**: We don't really care what his excuse is.
**Jcurtin**: He just needs to get there.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: And that.
**Jcurtin**: Nick, can you shoot me over the notice you plan to put him on?
**Jdawson**: Oh, yeah, I can do that.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, I just want to read through it real quick because.
**Jcurtin**: And then I'll let you know when to issue it to that guy, but I can.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: It's probably time to make sure that's ready to go.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: Has.
**Jcurtin**: Has United gotten back to you on a crew?
**Jdawson**: They said if we let them know today, then I think on Friday they.
**Jdawson**: They can have guys out there.
**Bclymer**: Okay, hold on.
**Bclymer**: But.
**Bclymer**: But let's cl.
**Bclymer**: We gotta make sure we're on the same page with that, because what Zach told me on the phone is that his guys out there Friday is just for asphalting in a park parking lot.
**Bclymer**: It's not about anything with concrete or doing concrete around the dock door.
**Bclymer**: It's just asphalt is what Zach told me.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, he does.
**Jdawson**: He doesn't.
**Jdawson**: He's not going to be able to get concrete guys in a timely manner.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So it would just be asphalt.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Which we said earlier that the concrete needs to be done first before the asphalt.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: That it should be him even bringing, like, if.
**Bclymer**: If Rick doesn't pour this thing, like, I mean, as early as, like tomorrow evening or something, then Zach trying to get guys out here Friday is like, that's not even helpful to us right now because we.
**Bclymer**: We may not even have the concrete done by then.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, but Zach and.
**Bclymer**: And I asked Zach about the dock door area, and he's just all.
**Bclymer**: He said the best is what he could offer as a crew for asphalt as long as we get the concrete done by a certain day.
**Bclymer**: You know, if we have it done before Friday, then yeah, he can come out, but if not, then he didn't really give me an estimated day for next week.
**Bclymer**: It sounded like it was full next week and he really Wasn't sure what he could help with next week, but he knows that this Friday he could help.
**Bclymer**: If we would have gotten.
**Bclymer**: If we could get the concrete done before then.
**Jdawson**: Maybe if we send them a notice, though, they'll start taking the job more seriously.
**Jcurtin**: I wouldn't expect much out of him to be put on notice.
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: Because most of these guys know that it costs more money to deal with the legal stuff than their.
**Jcurtin**: Than it's worth chasing him after.
**Jcurtin**: After him for.
**Jcurtin**: What is this guy's contract value?
**Jremillard**: He.
**Jdawson**: He has a.
**Jdawson**: More than enough in his site work number to.
**Jdawson**: To cover.
**Jdawson**: Cover United.
**Jcurtin**: I can't.
**Jcurtin**: You're breaking up through all this?
**Jcurtin**: Sorry, I can't hear anything.
**Jdawson**: He has.
**Jdawson**: He has enough in his contract amount to cover the cost of United Excavating.
**Jcurtin**: I know, but what's his total contract value?
**Jdawson**: I can pull that up.
**Jcurtin**: Oh, just ballpark.
**Jcurtin**: You don't need to give it exact.
**Jdawson**: It's 125,000.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: So it's a.
**Jcurtin**: It's a plus.
**Jdawson**: We have 40,000 in change orders.
**Jdawson**: So 165,000.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: So I call Nick, give that guy a call, and then if he.
**Jcurtin**: Because the other thing is that if we put him on notice, he's going to get all butthurt and then we're going to get pushed even further back.
**Jcurtin**: And it's a 72 hour notice.
**Jcurtin**: So he has 72 hours.
**Jdawson**: We have 48 hours in our contract.
**Jcurtin**: Okay, so that's.
**Jcurtin**: That's perfect.
**Jcurtin**: I was wondering about that because 72 is long.
**Jcurtin**: It's usually 48, but still, that's 48 hour notice is tomorrow and Friday.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: So, yeah, we kind of need to get an answer out of them.
**Jcurtin**: And I would just flat, you know, like, you can.
**Jcurtin**: You gauge it better than I can when you're talking to him if he's pissed or not, but you can even flat out ask him like, dude, if you don't have time to do it, we'll deduct that value out of your contract.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Jcurtin**: You know what I mean?
**Bclymer**: You know, or if he, you know, I know he was in a doctor's appointment yesterday.
**Jcurtin**: What's that, Jack?
**Bclymer**: Can you hear me?
**Jdawson**: I think there's something wrong with your computer, Jesse, because I. I hear Jack just fine.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: I can't hear a word he's saying.
**Jcurtin**: Here, let me.
**Bclymer**: Can you hear me, Jesse?
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: Can you hear me?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: Okay, try again.
**Jcurtin**: I think that worked.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: You know, like you said, if.
**Bclymer**: If he's just honest and just like, I don't have the time right now, or if.
**Bclymer**: If it.
**Bclymer**: If it's even potentially at the point where, like, I know he's.
**Bclymer**: He's mentioned just a slight bit of how he's got some medical stuff going on, and he had this really big.
**Jcurtin**: Yes.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, he talked me through all that.
**Jcurtin**: That's why I'm saying I think he's a good dude and he's not going to want to mess around.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: So if he can just be straight with us.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Jcurtin**: You know, because if United's willing to do it for this price, then that's a pretty easy answer.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Or if even somebody, I don't know, like one of his foremans that are running crews for him can, like, work this out with us and give us more of his just full attention and, like, coordination.
**Jcurtin**: You're not gonna.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: That's shooting for the stars with a guy like this, though, because what.
**Jcurtin**: What these guys do is they have all these jobs going at the same time, and they just bounce around to him, you know, because concrete work is usually, you know, like, forming.
**Jcurtin**: It's not going to take very long to form up someone's driveway.
**Bclymer**: True.
**Jcurtin**: You know, so they bounce around, and then when they have pores, they all get together on pour, and then they're all there.
**Jcurtin**: So it's.
**Jcurtin**: It's going to be a tough one.
**Jcurtin**: But I think the route of just asking to be straight with you, Nick, and then if we're confirmed that United will do it for these prices, I would just be honest with them.
**Jcurtin**: Be like, dude, we'll just take it out of your scope.
**Jcurtin**: We can get it done right now.
**Jcurtin**: You know, we just need it done.
**Jcurtin**: We don't want to burn a bridge with you or anything.
**Jcurtin**: You know, just take that approach.
**Jcurtin**: Okay, but.
**Jcurtin**: So.
**Bclymer**: But can United actually do the concrete right now?
**Jdawson**: No, they.
**Jdawson**: They don't have anyone for concrete.
**Jcurtin**: When do they have the concrete guys available?
**Jdawson**: They're a week and a half out.
**Jcurtin**: Oh, yeah.
**Bclymer**: This is just.
**Bclymer**: Zach's only offered asphalt right now so far, so if.
**Bclymer**: Okay, as long as.
**Bclymer**: I mean, if we want to bring up the conversation about taking the asphalt out of his contract.
**Jcurtin**: Well, is that.
**Jcurtin**: How much is that holding up right now versus concrete?
**Bclymer**: We still couldn't even get the.
**Bclymer**: The asphalt started until Rick finishes the.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, so it's not even really worth enlisting them.
**Jcurtin**: Right.
**Jcurtin**: Are you there?
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, I think we lost Jack.
**Jdawson**: Jack, you there?
**Jcurtin**: Jack?
**Jdawson**: I'll text him.
**Jcurtin**: Jeff.
**Jcurtin**: It's not going to help our schedule at all, then.
**Jcurtin**: There's not really any point to try to get united.
**Jdawson**: Well, that I think.
**Jdawson**: I think it would help if.
**Jcurtin**: If.
**Jdawson**: He'S able to pour the concrete underneath the canopy, because after he does that, then we.
**Jdawson**: I think we'd be going back and forth with him trying to get him to do the asphalt, and he would push out the asphalt.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: I mean, if you think it's beneficial to the schedule.
**Jcurtin**: Because I think that Rick dial work with us, so we just need to.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, I talked to him yesterday.
**Jcurtin**: He seems like a very reasonable guy.
**Jcurtin**: We just got to make sure we know exactly what we're pulling from his scope with the values and communicate that to him via email and get him to confirm it.
**Jcurtin**: And then we have to follow up with the change order or just send the change order.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: But yeah, let's just talk through the.
**Jcurtin**: The details of what that.
**Jcurtin**: What, what it's going to get us.
**Jcurtin**: Are you good?
**Jcurtin**: Are you getting good signal again?
**Jcurtin**: Jack?
**Jdawson**: Jack, you're on mute.
**Bclymer**: I don't know what just happened.
**Bclymer**: I guess I got.
**Bclymer**: I got glitched out.
**Bclymer**: Can y' all hear me?
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, like a.
**Bclymer**: Like I said, I mean, where it could help out to get this asphalt is if Rick is only able to give us just enough time for him to at least complete the apron and complete around the dock door area.
**Bclymer**: But then he then falls short and drags his feet on the asphalt.
**Bclymer**: So we can at least like if he has three big things for us to complete for us.
**Bclymer**: And look, let's.
**Bclymer**: Let's take a little ease off however we want to word it, and we've got the asphalt taken care of.
**Bclymer**: But can.
**Bclymer**: What can we do to please accomplish around the doctor and the concrete around the apron?
**Bclymer**: And like I said, they offered me a plan, his foreman did about backing up a concrete truck over where our handicap ramp is right now and getting a shooter in through there.
**Bclymer**: And I said, okay, well, the ramp's not bolted down, so I can get it moved.
**Bclymer**: But then when I said, when would you like me to move it for you?
**Bclymer**: When can you do it?
**Bclymer**: Then his foreman said, well, I'm not sure exactly which day.
**Bclymer**: Let me get with Rick.
**Bclymer**: So it's.
**Bclymer**: There's a plan in place.
**Bclymer**: But again, still, it.
**Bclymer**: It boils back down to them locking in exact days.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, that's.
**Jcurtin**: That's definitely a good thing to talk to him about.
**Jcurtin**: Don't.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, he just, He's.
**Jcurtin**: He can't.
**Jcurtin**: It sounds like he just can't commit to anything as far as schedule.
**Jcurtin**: It's just, it's all like this Window.
**Jcurtin**: For him, it's not days, and it needs to be days.
**Jcurtin**: And we need to get him to commit to at least that scope that Jack was talking about.
**Jcurtin**: Under the canopy.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah, yes, that, that.
**Bclymer**: But really, Honestly, the.
**Bclymer**: The Dr. Area is just as important because I can't close in the building until he does what he's got to do.
**Bclymer**: And then once I close in the building, then I can get AC on in the back of the.
**Bclymer**: In the back of house and then drop tile in the rooms.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, because that inside portion also has a window.
**Jcurtin**: Right.
**Jcurtin**: Or the scaffold.
**Bclymer**: What's that?
**Jcurtin**: The inside portion of his work also has a time frame.
**Jcurtin**: He has to complete it currently with the scaffold.
**Jcurtin**: Right?
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: I mean, they mentioned about.
**Bclymer**: They said that it would be better for them if the scaffolding and everything was just completely out the way.
**Bclymer**: And we just held off the block guys for a couple days.
**Bclymer**: And I was like, well, if I even did that, what would the couple days be?
**Bclymer**: And then the same thing.
**Bclymer**: They're just like, well, we're not sure yet.
**Bclymer**: And I'm like, okay, well, if I stop the block guys from continuing, then I'm going to miss my.
**Bclymer**: My date of being able to weld the beams before Wednesday.
**Bclymer**: Because our current welder, who is a part of the erection company that erected all the steel out here, he's only going to be in town until next Wednesday and then he's going to be in a whole different state for a while.
**Bclymer**: So then we'd have to reach out to him, like, and outsource the welding to somebody else.
**Jcurtin**: Do you think he can get this Rick guy on a teams call?
**Jdawson**: I don't know if he.
**Jdawson**: He does teams.
**Jcurtin**: He does because he's been in the subcontractor meeting.
**Bclymer**: Okay, I'm gonna try to give him another ring right now.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, maybe you can put your phone by the speaker, Chad.
**Bclymer**: All right, let me see if I can get him to pick up right now.
**Jcurtin**: If this doesn't work, let's try to get him a team's invite because he's probably going to call in the old fashioned way.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, he's.
**Bclymer**: Now, I've never been able to get him in teams.
**Bclymer**: His wife has joined once.
**Jcurtin**: He was in last week's subcontractor meeting.
**Bclymer**: No, I just.
**Bclymer**: I had him in the same thing.
**Bclymer**: Speaker.
**Jcurtin**: Oh.
**Bclymer**: Your call has been forwarded to an automated.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: Nothing.
**Jcurtin**: Okay, Nick, give them a try after this meeting.
**Jcurtin**: And then if you can't get a hold of them, shoot me a text.
**Jcurtin**: And then I'll try them.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: And then I. I'll try to.
**Jcurtin**: If I can get a hold of them or you, Nick, just try to patch us into the call.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: So that way we can all be on the phone with them.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: And then, Jack, when we do that, just have the schedule open so you can be looking at that.
**Jcurtin**: And send us that.
**Jcurtin**: Send us the one that you were referencing that stated 8, 18.
**Bclymer**: Okay, gotcha.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I.
**Jremillard**: What are they currently doing today?
**Jremillard**: I missed the first part.
**Jcurtin**: They're currently not being there.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, they're not here again.
**Bclymer**: This morning they said that they would try, but it's looking like mostly this afternoon they would come back because they have another pour somewhere else this morning.
**Jcurtin**: And yesterday he told me that his crew would be there yesterday and today, which they came yesterday for a bit, and he would be there himself this morning.
**Jcurtin**: And now he's not answering the phone.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I just tried to call him.
**Jdawson**: He didn't answer.
**Jcurtin**: Okay, I'll try him in a little bit.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, and send over that notice draft.
**Jremillard**: What is.
**Jremillard**: What is done?
**Jremillard**: Do we have photos of the outside of this place now?
**Bclymer**: Yes, he has.
**Bclymer**: As far as.
**Bclymer**: What does he have done?
**Jremillard**: Like, what on the site is done.
**Jremillard**: Do we have pictures of the site?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I mean, I have.
**Bclymer**: I have the whole canopy of pie wrapped in den's glass.
**Bclymer**: The alley still hasn't been extended.
**Jremillard**: I'm saying we got like, here we are.
**Jremillard**: We need the curb in the back redone.
**Jremillard**: We got the curbs in the front to be redone.
**Jremillard**: And we got the canopy, concrete, like without those things done.
**Jremillard**: Unless you want to pave it and then they have to cut it in and destroy our pavement with the concrete trucks.
**Bclymer**: He wanted to do the concrete underneath the canopy and.
**Bclymer**: And do the other two items of site work all at the same time.
**Bclymer**: But earlier I mentioned.
**Bclymer**: So his.
**Bclymer**: His foreman, she kind of.
**Bclymer**: He probably wouldn't have wanted her to do this, but she's shared a bit too much information with me that they're basically overbooked this week.
**Bclymer**: That there's two other general contractors that are in the same situation we're in right now and basically really need them to get done because they got openings next week.
**Bclymer**: So that's where.
**Bclymer**: That's what's hiding behind Rick and his excuses right now is that basically he's just trying to figure it out.
**Bclymer**: And that's why they're not being able to lock everything in.
**Bclymer**: In any dates now.
**Bclymer**: They gave.
**Bclymer**: They gave an option of how we can still get the doctor area done and that's moving the ADA ramp that's not bolted down and bringing in a shooter truck over in there in that back corner.
**Bclymer**: And I was like, okay, great, well, when can I move the ramp for you?
**Bclymer**: When can you get started on that?
**Bclymer**: And then she said, I'm not sure.
**Bclymer**: I have to talk with Rick.
**Bclymer**: No, but she did say that she thinks that they can get poured underneath the canopy and everything done, including the extending of the alley curves, which did just get marked yesterday.
**Bclymer**: They had a locator come out and do all the rest of the site work in the concrete underneath the canopy, not including any asphalt or regrading, but all that done by no later than Monday.
**Bclymer**: But then they couldn't guarantee.
**Bclymer**: But they wouldn't give me full breakdowns of like, okay, we would do this on this date, and then we're going to pour on this day.
**Bclymer**: Because right now they're just trying to figure it out between three different jobs right now and bouncing around you there.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: And so United doesn't have a concrete coup crew for two weeks.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, a week and a half.
**Bclymer**: We can have the best.
**Bclymer**: The best that they could do is giving us an asphalt guy out for the.
**Bclymer**: In the parking lot.
**Bclymer**: He said he could give it to us as early as Friday, but that would only be beneficial for us if we could finish the concrete underneath the canopy by Friday, which right now, that's not for certain at all.
**Bclymer**: So then I mentioned that to Zach, but then he said, well, then if that pushes them into helping us with the asphalt next week.
**Bclymer**: He said he wasn't sure yet on which day next week he could jump in and help with the asphalt.
**Jcurtin**: We just need this concrete guy to get off his ass.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Big time.
**Bclymer**: I mean, at least pick up the phone.
**Bclymer**: I mean, you know, or it's just when he tells me over and over, yeah, I'm gonna be there in the morning.
**Bclymer**: I'll be there in the morning.
**Bclymer**: Now it's the same thing.
**Bclymer**: I've bugged him and his wife all morning.
**Bclymer**: Can't hear.
**Jcurtin**: Does he text?
**Jcurtin**: I've.
**Bclymer**: I've texted him, but, I mean, his texting is the same about his calling right now.
**Bclymer**: I mean, usually by the time he texts me back is when I can get him on the phone, but he won't.
**Bclymer**: He won't text.
**Bclymer**: Like, if.
**Bclymer**: If I can't get him on the phone, it's not like he'll.
**Bclymer**: Like sometimes people won't be able to answer a call, but they'll be able to text, but he won't even.
**Bclymer**: He can't even.
**Bclymer**: He won't even be able to do that because I've texted him, too.
**Bclymer**: Today, this morning.
**Jcurtin**: Can you put your schedule back up?
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: How much work is still under the canopy?
**Jcurtin**: About a day.
**Jcurtin**: Half a day.
**Jcurtin**: Day and a half.
**Bclymer**: I'd say about a day and a half.
**Bclymer**: Like, if.
**Bclymer**: If they could come out here and give a strong evening, like, work almost until sun sets and then a full day tomorrow, then I feel like they could pour come Friday around noon.
**Bclymer**: And that also includes a strong morning from them.
**Bclymer**: Friday, then they could accomplish pouring by at least Friday.
**Jcurtin**: And so far, they've not had one strong day since they've been there.
**Bclymer**: And since.
**Bclymer**: Say that again.
**Jcurtin**: Since they've been on this project, they have not performed like that at all, have they?
**Bclymer**: When they did the first.
**Bclymer**: When they first did demo of the parking lot and forming up sidewalks underneath the canopy, I mean, they had full strong days then.
**Bclymer**: But even, like, they would go, strong day, strong day, half day.
**Bclymer**: Or sometimes it'd be a strong day, half day, strong day.
**Bclymer**: About to share my screen.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, we need to.
**Jcurtin**: We need to get this guy on the phone.
**Bclymer**: All right, I got.
**Bclymer**: Can you see my screen?
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: I don't think trying to contract someone this short notice is even going to be worth looking into.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, because it's.
**Jcurtin**: It doesn't have much scope left for concrete, it looks like.
**Bclymer**: No, I just.
**Jremillard**: Jesse, do you think, like, the only way in the world we're going to get done next week is if we, number one, tell the asphalt sub, lock him in to, like, next Wednesday paving it, and then you tell this concrete sub, listen, I'm gonna have to take out this asphalt.
**Jremillard**: I have to lock them in for Wednesday.
**Jremillard**: If you are not done, we are.
**Jremillard**: Seriously, it's not going to end well for you guys because you've delayed us.
**Jremillard**: We're going to have to put you on delay.
**Jremillard**: And the only way you're going to get out of here without being hurt is.
**Jremillard**: Is to get the concrete done.
**Jremillard**: But we have to get the paving on it, because who knows when they would ever get the paving done.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: And we'd probably want to issue them the notice today to exhaust their 48 hours this week.
**Jcurtin**: So then they're on borrowed time until next week into next week.
**Jremillard**: I'll say if the concrete's not done by the time our paver gets here to remobilize, you know, we may have to just pave over everything.
**Jremillard**: And at this point.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, at this point.
**Jremillard**: And.
**Jremillard**: And they would have to cut the concrete out later.
**Jremillard**: You Know, now that we've raised all these grades, we.
**Jremillard**: I think we got enough cover.
**Jremillard**: We could change it to asphalt at those columns.
**Bclymer**: Would.
**Bclymer**: Would goodwill give us any pushback with that, you think?
**Jremillard**: Well, no, that.
**Jremillard**: You tell the concrete guy, all right, I'm gonna have to come back and cut out this pavement and install the concrete after the fact, but I can't shut this down.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And then would we just.
**Bclymer**: Sorry, Would we just.
**Bclymer**: Then the framer would shoot his track just right down to the asphalt.
**Jremillard**: You still need to pour those columns out around the base of the foundation.
**Jremillard**: Like, that has to be concrete.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, yeah, there's still concrete work that would absolutely have to be done first.
**Jremillard**: But again, they.
**Jremillard**: They'll have to cut that out and pour it in after I box it out.
**Jremillard**: But, like, how are we getting the.
**Jremillard**: How's the EFAS getting done on the canopy?
**Jremillard**: Like, when is that date?
**Bclymer**: So I had it.
**Bclymer**: I had him starting concrete on the canopy Monday, being done by Thursday, and then framing and sheathing this Friday.
**Bclymer**: And then the EFAS guy said that if I had the columns framed and sheathed by the end of this week, that he will do all the columns and he'll wrap the.
**Bclymer**: The EFIs back around the window openings this weekend and be done with it, and then I could paint all of it next week.
**Jremillard**: Well, the concrete ain't happening.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: So that's.
**Bclymer**: That was the.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: So, Jesse, if you can get a hold of this guy.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: Because you can talk to them, be like, listen, we're gonna have to change the pavement, have someone else do it, and deduct this whole thing out of your contract.
**Jremillard**: Like, you're leaving us no choice of getting this thing open or however we got to do it, you know?
**Jremillard**: And when it comes to pouring that concrete back in the loading dock.
**Jcurtin**: I.
**Jremillard**: Mean, I don't see any good pictures of what it looks like heading into the loading dock.
**Jcurtin**: So how.
**Jcurtin**: How much?
**Jcurtin**: If.
**Jcurtin**: If we had to push back the framing and everything with this canopy to accommodate this guy coming back to do concrete, is that even feasible?
**Jremillard**: Go back to the guy sticking the foam right to the columns?
**Jremillard**: I guess at this point.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: The EFIS guy said he.
**Jdawson**: He can't do.
**Jremillard**: There.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: Maybe Rick will be relieved if you're getting the asphalt done by someone else.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Jremillard**: Listen, this is the only way you're going to get out of this without becoming hurt.
**Jremillard**: Like, we're going to get hurt if we don't get this open on time.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Jremillard**: I guess, like, they can get this done.
**Jremillard**: But they're going to be here Wednesday morning to pave it, come hell or high water.
**Jremillard**: All this concrete, all the curbs have to be 100% done.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, like you said, maybe be relieved.
**Bclymer**: And like we.
**Jremillard**: But you think about it, now we got all this EFIS work and all that other to do, like new asphalt, new concrete.
**Jremillard**: How they're going to work on any, you know, working on a lift.
**Jremillard**: I mean, if they work the next day, unless you pour some high early mix, you know, you're gonna have to wait a couple days before they can get on it to work on it.
**Jcurtin**: Is an accelerant out of spec for this?
**Jremillard**: There is no spec really, as far as we can put whatever we want in the concrete.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, Nick, send over that notice.
**Jcurtin**: Let's get that ready to go up.
**Jcurtin**: I'm just going to start hounding this guy.
**Jdawson**: Jack.
**Jcurtin**: Can you send me his wife's number, too?
**Jcurtin**: You said she's part of the business, right?
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, can you send me her number too, please?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: And just kind of hang by the phones, you guys.
**Jcurtin**: If I can get this guy on the phone and if I need to patch you in.
**Jcurtin**: So if we got to talk through any details.
**Bclymer**: Yes, definitely, please.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, because it sounds like this guy's gonna tell me one thing and you one thing.
**Jcurtin**: And Nick, one other thing.
**Bclymer**: Exactly, exactly.
**Jremillard**: And Nick, call up United and get him locked in for next Wednesday if you can.
**Jdawson**: Okay, got it.
**Jcurtin**: Then let's.
**Jcurtin**: We'll just keep in touch through the teams messenger otherwise and make sure we get this all figured out and what we're going to do.
**Jcurtin**: All right.
**Jcurtin**: All right, thanks, guys.
**Jcurtin**: See you.
