**Ataylor**: We sent letter of intent request to the owner today because they're still working on the contract.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: We sent permit.
**Ataylor**: The building department here is kind of screwy, and they want the subcontractor building permits turned in prior to giving the building permit.
**Ataylor**: So they've been sent to the plumber, electrician, and fire sprinkler sub to get them filled out.
**Ataylor**: The permit review is 20 days.
**Ataylor**: They're a week into that.

**Jdawson**: Jesse syndrome.
**Ataylor**: So I sent that to Justin Kimmich to give us some ideas on hotel, what that would look like on that site too.

**Ataylor**: So I'll get with you.
**Ataylor**: I'll send that to you, Andres.
**Njepson**: Okay, perfect.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Something else, Jesse.
**Jdawson**: What about Portal like Dave estimated still not started.

**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Right now, so.
**Jdawson**: Okay, Sounds good.
**Jdawson**: Seminole collected.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Ataylor**: That one still said he hasn't told us whether.
**Ataylor**: What they're doing with the volleyball courts.
**Speaker 6**: Did you put together that.
**Speaker 6**: That.
**Speaker 6**: That blue beam sheet that showed the acreages of the three.
**Ataylor**: Yes, that was sent a couple weeks ago.
**Speaker 6**: Okay.
**Speaker 6**: That's all we were supposed to deliver to him.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So still.
**Jdawson**: So still waiting, right, Jesse?
**Ataylor**: I'm sorry.
**Jdawson**: It's still waiting on the city, you said?
**Ataylor**: Yeah, we're just waiting on the city to tell us who's building the volleyball courts.
**Ataylor**: And they're building.
**Ataylor**: And then they got to give us the.
**Ataylor**: They have to split up the property, I guess to make it one section that they're gonna give to the container side.
**Ataylor**: And the rest of it is the city's volleyball facility.
**Gducharme**: Okay, perfect.
**Jdawson**: Everything here is still in progress.
**Jdawson**: You copy these ones from Ken.
**Jdawson**: Do you remember you still need all of these ones, Jesse.
**Jdawson**: This a bunch?
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: Whenever we hire Ken's replacement, we'll get you that name to put in there.
**Jdawson**: Okay, Sounds good.
**Jdawson**: Okay, perfect.
**Jdawson**: This is AJ If I'm not wrong.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: Applying to near office remodel.
**Adelgado**: Yeah, so no update really.
**Adelgado**: I'm currently working on getting the CDs and mechanical drawings.
**Adelgado**: I've been getting prices based on what we have now because the.
**Adelgado**: The minor changes in the CDs are more in finishes.
**Adelgado**: But it looks like I've picked up around 60k between electrical and framing alone.
**Adelgado**: And I already sent them an estimated price on the changes.
**Adelgado**: And so that's on top of that.
**Njepson**: So that's.
**Adelgado**: That's a good thing.
**Adelgado**: We'll see what.
**Adelgado**: What the finishes come back with.
**Adelgado**: So it's.
**Adelgado**: We gotta wait to see the tile type, the ceiling tile type for those clouds.
**Adelgado**: But I think we're looking good there.
**Adelgado**: Yeah.
**Adelgado**: And all those tasks are updated.
**Adelgado**: So I'll have Alex start putting a schedule together.
**Adelgado**: That way it's ready to Go.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Thank you.
**Jdawson**: A.J.
**Jdawson**: this is yours.
**Jdawson**: To Denville Theater.
**Adelgado**: Yep.
**Adelgado**: So I spoke with.
**Adelgado**: I met with Jerome on Neiman on Friday and he said that he's going to take a look at this.
**Adelgado**: As far as what it would take to have an architect draw it up.
**Adelgado**: I think he may even just do it on the side because it is more residential.
**Adelgado**: But he said that they've actually done something like this before, so he's gonna send me over.
**Adelgado**: Proposal.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Neiman Holding, FedEx.
**Jdawson**: A.J.
**Adelgado**: Yep.
**Adelgado**: Let Shannon Corey know that we had a steel increase, so waiting to get pricing back on that from another subcontractor.
**Adelgado**: I got the updated drawings late on Friday.
**Adelgado**: There was just a couple changes I wanted Jerome to note.
**Adelgado**: And then we sent the architectural site plan to the state.
**Adelgado**: They were asking for that since we're cutting in new openings.
**Adelgado**: So once we get the cdr, I'll be able to submit to Carmel.
**Adelgado**: So I guess Carmel, the notification I got is they won't even look at it until I have an approved cdr.
**Adelgado**: So they won't.
**Adelgado**: For future reference, when we do work in Carmel, they won't look at it until that CDR is approved.
**Adelgado**: Yep, that's it there.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Nick Spires on Lucy.
**Bclymer**: Just final billing for that project.
**Jdawson**: You said final billing, correct?
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Gducharme**: Okay, perfect.
**Jdawson**: So everything is done.
**Gducharme**: Okay, good.
**Speaker 6**: Nick, are we going back there at all?
**Bclymer**: Not that I know of.
**Speaker 6**: Is there.
**Speaker 6**: I mean, they've got their co, right?
**Speaker 6**: Are they back in the area and everything or what?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, they.
**Bclymer**: They have the co.
**Bclymer**: They did their punch walk.
**Speaker 6**: Are they fully occupied or is it still waiting?
**Bclymer**: I.
**Bclymer**: I would imagine they're using it.
**Speaker 6**: I was hoping to get some good finished pictures.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I think we had it clean and now it's.
**Bclymer**: It's starting to get messy in there from.
**Bclymer**: From the owners.
**Speaker 6**: I mean.
**Speaker 6**: Yeah, we can't do it if they've got patients in there.
**Bclymer**: I'm sure we.
**Bclymer**: We could get some photos, but we.
**Ataylor**: Talk a Ridge Haven or spot spots.
**Ataylor**: St.
**Ataylor**: Louis.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, Ridge Haven.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, it's their dining area.
**Ataylor**: So I'm sure we can just go in there after the noon rush and take some pictures after they clean up.
**Speaker 6**: I mean, and even like getting pictures of the outside and everything all finished.
**Speaker 6**: Like.
**Speaker 6**: And we just say like, you know, we.
**Speaker 6**: We completed renovation of the, you know, Port St.
**Speaker 6**: Lucie Aspire.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Oh, yeah.
**Bclymer**: St.
**Bclymer**: Lucy.
**Bclymer**: That.
**Bclymer**: I don't think that would be good for promotions.
**Bclymer**: Like the roof, it doesn't look very good, but.
**Speaker 6**: Which one?
**Speaker 6**: Yeah, which was the one that we.
**Adelgado**: We pretty much rebuilt Ridge Haven.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, so we can get some pictures there.
**Speaker 6**: Okay, good.
**Speaker 6**: Yeah, we need some good marketing pictures.
**Bclymer**: Hey, Maria, you're on mute.
**Jdawson**: I'm sorry.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I was muted.
**Jdawson**: So what I was saying is that I sent to Anika some videos, the photos that you actually share on the folder, so.
**Jdawson**: From the ones that you have on the corridor.
**Jdawson**: So I just shared them with her.
**Jdawson**: So we'll see.
**Jdawson**: We have good pictures there.
**Jdawson**: If you guys can get more will be awesome.
**Gducharme**: Thank you, Nick.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Cor Exotech, this is Brandon.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, so waiting on final bill.
**Speaker 6**: Yeah, and then I.
**Speaker 6**: I'm trying to see if we're waiting on the damn firearm guys.
**Speaker 6**: Damn it.
**Speaker 6**: Another month before they get the fire alarm control panel done.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Nothing else here.
**Speaker 6**: Right.

**Bclymer**: Oh, Glenn, you're.
**Bclymer**: You're on mute.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Speaker 7**: Working on a Stormline this week.
**Speaker 7**: We still get waiting on citizens to get our link over to us to pay for the permit for sanitary and water to get started.
**Speaker 7**: But I think Ryan said he spoke with him this morning and they gave him the go ahead to get going.
**Speaker 7**: So he's planning on getting that started this week.
**Speaker 7**: We work on finishing up the building pad.
**Speaker 7**: We got had some weather in the forecast this week, so the AG peers pushed out to next Monday.
**Speaker 7**: Between that and not getting everything back from JQOL and Steel Le Master in time, there just wasn't enough time for them to get everything needed for their shop drawings.
**Speaker 7**: So.
**Speaker 6**: So do we have updated schedule that reflects that?
**Speaker 7**: No, we haven't updated the schedule yet.
**Speaker 7**: I think we had really kind of like a week float in there next week anyways before our foundation started.
**Speaker 6**: Okay.
**Speaker 7**: So nothing's gonna.
**Speaker 7**: Nothing should push aside from this.
**Speaker 6**: Do we get a price back from Eli?
**Speaker 7**: He has not sent it back yet.
**Speaker 7**: No, he said it would.
**Speaker 7**: He said it would take him a few days to get that.
**Speaker 7**: I don't think I talked to him until like Thursday last week.
**Speaker 6**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Nothing else to add here.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: Aj, I think this is you.
**Jdawson**: No, Nick, Goodwill Corp office.
**Bclymer**: We're waiting on the right away permit.
**Ataylor**: So do you get any response from these guys?
**Ataylor**: Nick?
**Bclymer**: I.
**Bclymer**: I don't.
**Bclymer**: When I call, I go straight to voicemail and I.
**Bclymer**: I leave a message.
**Bclymer**: And when we email, they.
**Bclymer**: They don't respond.
**Bclymer**: It shows that it's not assigned to anybody to review.
**Ataylor**: Can you go into this building department tomorrow when you're traveling about and find out what's going on?
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: Go in Go in with an IU shirt, not a Purdue shirt.
**Speaker 6**: He probably doesn't have either one.
**Adelgado**: Well, I'll get.
**Ataylor**: He's got a Wisconsin shirt.
**Adelgado**: Go knock some heads on those people, Nick.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Steva Consulting Building Brandon in Jesse.
**Speaker 6**: Mike seems to be doing well, so he's getting proposals, projects, tracking.
**Speaker 6**: So do we need.
**Ataylor**: Or did you take care of that change order on the PO or do we still need to do something with that for the material?
**Speaker 6**: So I.
**Speaker 6**: We should be done ordering stuff now.
**Speaker 6**: I just saw where we ordered more stuff.
**Speaker 6**: And then I'm having corn, Maine.
**Speaker 6**: Give me one change order because there's a bunch of stuff that needs to go back.
**Speaker 6**: And so I want to do one full change where it's got all the ads and the deducts and here's the met.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Something else here.
**Jdawson**: Everything is still in progress.
**Ataylor**: Does.
**Ataylor**: Does everyone know, like, accounting is sometimes putting PO invoices into notion?
**Ataylor**: So don't approve them in there.
**Ataylor**: Just respond to them and say these are part of a purchase order.
**Ataylor**: Tell the sub they need to bill through job planner or Procore, whatever's the kind.
**Ataylor**: Case.
**Adelgado**: Will do.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Goodwill Bloomington.
**Bclymer**: Nick, that's the permit.
**Ataylor**: We're not.
**Bclymer**: Can't really seem to get a hold of the building department.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Ataylor**: Nick, did you see the email today that came from the Goodwill attorney?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: And so just so you know, Brandon, the Goodwill's attorney, has contacted the building department.
**Ataylor**: They're wanting to give them a letter of understanding because this has nothing to do with them.
**Ataylor**: It's all the.
**Ataylor**: The owner of the property.
**Ataylor**: So they just want them to know that it's going to be dealt with by the owner and we don't have to resubmit or wait for them to get that document on the easements and those things.
**Ataylor**: What'd you say, Nick?
**Bclymer**: I.
**Bclymer**: I didn't say anything.
**Speaker 6**: I said that would be great.
**Ataylor**: Oh, yeah, yeah.
**Ataylor**: Yep.
**Ataylor**: So.
**Ataylor**: And just so you know, Nick, I called Andrew and talked to him about it.
**Ataylor**: He wasn't copied on it, so I forwarded it to him.
**Ataylor**: And so hopefully coming from an attorney, Bloomington can respond to those emails in a timely manner.
**Jdawson**: Nick, there are some things here that are still in progress.
**Jdawson**: Is that correct?
**Jdawson**: The permit approval update, drawings that still in progress.
**Bclymer**: Yes.

**Bclymer**: They visited the site last week and they should have drawings this week.
**Jdawson**: Okay, A.J.
**Jdawson**: main physical stretch.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, back to that.
**Ataylor**: Nick, Ronnie wants us to write a change order for that because they're going to bill that to the insurance claim because they're only having to get it because they got to get inspections is how he's going to phrase it.
**Ataylor**: So make sure get that put together.
**Ataylor**: Make it the same price as the one we did for Daytona and get that to Ronnie, if you would.
**Jdawson**: Okay, aj.
**Jdawson**: MAF is Callistar Rush Phase one.
**Adelgado**: Let me see what I wrote here.
**Jdawson**: No update.
**Adelgado**: Is that what I said?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Adelgado**: No update.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: Yeah, so we.
**Adelgado**: We're just adding guardrails in there for them.
**Adelgado**: But that I ordered when I.
**Adelgado**: I ordered those last week.
**Adelgado**: They won't be here for two weeks.
**Speaker 6**: So just an ad if we can go.
**Ataylor**: I'm sorry, aj.
**Ataylor**: Just to go back to Newport.
**Ataylor**: Richie, too.
**Ataylor**: Nick, what's the update on the pricing for that change order to fix the front?
**Bclymer**: Last I checked, Camden was working on that.
**Bclymer**: So I can follow up.
**Adelgado**: I.
**Adelgado**: I would.
**Adelgado**: I would take that off his plate, Nick, because Canon's right now pretty buried at ULTA this week.
**Adelgado**: So when you get with him, if you can have the capacity.
**Adelgado**: She's been working late nights and early morning, so burning at both ends.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: Okay, A.J.
**Jdawson**: Matthew'S call.
**Jdawson**: Siraj phase two.
**Adelgado**: Yeah, so I called and texted Kyle Eubanks, the guy whose license we're trying to use.
**Adelgado**: He hasn't gotten back to me yet, so I don't have an update.
**Adelgado**: I spoke with him last on Wednesday when we met and he didn't have an update then.
**Adelgado**: So from a licensing stand point, not sure yet.
**Adelgado**: And then we just waiting on marching orders from cart.
**Adelgado**: When I met with him on Tuesday last week, they have everything they need.
**Adelgado**: That job's done.
**Adelgado**: So we're just waiting to get released on this portion.
**Ataylor**: Have they said anything else?
**Ataylor**: Is it just a government audit?
**Ataylor**: Do we know anything more about when product would be showing up or is that changing?
**Ataylor**: They have.
**Adelgado**: I don't think they have a clue, Jesse.
**Adelgado**: And I was just.
**Adelgado**: I was trying to make it really clear to.
**Adelgado**: To Steve.
**Adelgado**: We, you know, we found that wire quicker that we can get in like eight to 10 weeks.
**Adelgado**: But I mean all these units are going to be 16 weeks out.
**Adelgado**: So as far as the RTUs go.
**Ataylor**: And have you talked to anybody of our subs about pricing?
**Ataylor**: Like is like our electrician, not like Dean saying wires going up 10% and.
**Adelgado**: You know I spoke with you last I spoke with guys was two weeks ago.
**Adelgado**: I have not.
**Adelgado**: I didn't speak with him last week but I spoke with the sheet metal guy, H Vac guy.
**Adelgado**: He.
**Adelgado**: He said here come a couple months something may happen.
**Adelgado**: But other than that, Brian hasn't said anything.
**Adelgado**: I've been talking with Brian every day for the most part.
**Adelgado**: He's always asking me for updates.
**Adelgado**: I haven't asked a specific question.
**Adelgado**: Well, why are pricing increase.
**Adelgado**: But it's not a bad idea to go that route and warn Steve.
**Adelgado**: Maybe that lights a fire under him so we can get it under contract.
**Adelgado**: What do you think?
**Speaker 6**: I mean we.
**Speaker 6**: We also don't really want to like light any fires.
**Speaker 6**: Yeah, because we're trying to get through our own damn audit.
**Adelgado**: Right.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: I mean at this point, what Another thing they're going through, Jesse, is they're trying to see how much ti money they're going to get.
**Adelgado**: And so me getting that letter to Steve as far as covering our friend Shane's comments, like it's all kind of working.
**Adelgado**: Working together.
**Adelgado**: Their.
**Adelgado**: Their lawyers are battling with real op to get more ti money as they executed an extended lease and then they have the government audit as well.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Nothing to add here.
**Jdawson**: E.J.
**Gducharme**: All good?
**Adelgado**: Nope.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Goodwill.
**Jdawson**: Bart, this is Nick.
**Bclymer**: We have a few remaining punch items.
**Bclymer**: There's some items they want price.
**Bclymer**: Some things they.
**Bclymer**: They changed in the final punch block and then I need to close out the sub change orders and then complete the bill.
**Ataylor**: Did you get the subs pay apps pulled back out of that last one?
**Bclymer**: No, I don't have the permissions I.
**Ataylor**: Don'T think Brandon, but like we had just some.
**Ataylor**: I don't think it's a lot like under 10,000 of back charges between some of the subs for repainting which we're still trying to associate with what.
**Ataylor**: Who's responsible for what.
**Ataylor**: But it's just a pain in the ass to try and at least it used to be.
**Ataylor**: Maybe not the way we do it.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, to get it out of the retainage versus doing a change order before retainage.
**Speaker 6**: So we've got.
**Speaker 6**: We've got 10,000 in back charges.
**Speaker 6**: From who to who?
**Ataylor**: Drywaller, painter, the cabinet guys in there.
**Ataylor**: It'll involve a little bit of the plumber fire sprinkler and Is it clear as day or.
**Speaker 6**: That's the problem is it's muddy.
**Ataylor**: It's muddy.
**Ataylor**: It's all muddy.
**Speaker 6**: Do you know what's our.
**Speaker 6**: What's our profit on that job?
**Bclymer**: Somewhere around 175.
**Speaker 6**: No way.
**Speaker 6**: We only made 10% on that job?
**Bclymer**: I believe so.
**Speaker 6**: I mean, we baked in $50,000 extra to cover Tremont.
**Ataylor**: No, no, that's Bloomington.
**Bclymer**: That's a Bloomington.
**Speaker 6**: Here.
**Speaker 6**: Good old Bart.
**Speaker 6**: What do you want to do, Jesse?
**Ataylor**: Well, some of it was like, we moved the fire extinguisher cabinet because we didn't get a rated cabinet.
**Ataylor**: So there's some of that.
**Ataylor**: That's ours.
**Ataylor**: Some of it.
**Ataylor**: You know, Goodwill's folks came in and put all their TVs up, and I'm sure they did some damage, you know, others, again, it's like fighting with subs.
**Ataylor**: I don't know how much that's worth, but I'll look at the budget with Nick and make sure that's where we're at.
**Ataylor**: And I'll just give you a call, figure out what we'll do with it.
**Speaker 6**: Yeah, yeah, I guess, you know, Nick, just.
**Speaker 6**: If you can balance budget, and then we'll just make a decision because right now it's showing.
**Speaker 6**: You know, I've got.
**Speaker 6**: I mean, we've got some money in forecast to complete.
**Speaker 6**: So I'm interested to see, like, it shows $48,000 and unallocated.
**Speaker 6**: Like, is that going to turn into profit or what.
**Ataylor**: Have all the costs.
**Ataylor**: Like, what's the latest labor costs that have hit that job?
**Speaker 6**: Do we have Jose on this call?
**Speaker 6**: No, make sure we.
**Speaker 6**: Make sure we get Jose on this call moving forward.
**Gducharme**: Okay, I'll add him.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Speaker 6**: Yeah, we'll just look through that and see where the labor costs are.
**Speaker 6**: I mean, right now it's, you know.
**Speaker 6**: Yeah.
**Speaker 6**: Got some room on it, it looks like.
**Speaker 6**: I mean, we got see all the way through 4 11, it looks like.
**Speaker 6**: So it should be pretty.
**Speaker 6**: You know, it looks like missing a couple weeks on labor.
**Ataylor**: We got almost.
**Ataylor**: There's 192 in there, but I don't know if you're saying 170 because of thinking about that 10,000 and back charges.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I figured there's going to be some more costs coming in.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, let's look to Nick.
**Ataylor**: We'll clean it up.
**Speaker 6**: And then, I mean, at the end of the day, like, I would say, you know, it.
**Speaker 6**: Like, I.
**Speaker 6**: I don't know who's asking for the extra work or whatever.
**Speaker 6**: It's the painter, the drywaller, you know, But I would squeeze them a little bit on it and then be like, you know, hey, we're not.
**Speaker 6**: We're not gonna.
**Speaker 6**: We're just.
**Speaker 6**: We're gonna eat this because, you know, we.
**Speaker 6**: You Know, you guys are our team and we don't want everybody to do it.
**Speaker 6**: So, you know, let's look at this and like we're covering, you know, our cost.
**Speaker 6**: Like we don't want to get into a little tic tac thing.
**Speaker 6**: So like on the next job, you don't want us coming after you for every small thing that you mess up.
**Ataylor**: Agreed.
**Speaker 6**: See what you can ding them down to, Nick and then we'll go from there.
**Njepson**: Good.
**Jdawson**: Aj, Great escape.
**Adelgado**: Yes, we.
**Adelgado**: What did I.
**Adelgado**: So, yeah, so I'm getting my proof roll done at 10 o'clock tomorrow.
**Adelgado**: Other than that, everything is set to be done this week.
**Jdawson**: Okay, what about these ones?
**Jdawson**: Not started.
**Jdawson**: April, PSR and billing, is that still not started?
**Adelgado**: Yeah, I'll probably do those tomorrow.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: Getting done before May 1st.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: A.J.
**Jdawson**: altadellas.
**Adelgado**: Yes.
**Adelgado**: So we're set to be done with the OPEX this week.
**Adelgado**: We'll probably get it inspected next week.
**Adelgado**: We're set to be done with the welding this week.
**Adelgado**: I'm meeting with dean tomorrow at 2 to go over next steps.
**Adelgado**: And I think I had an open item task on there to just figure out if there's any holes in our.
**Adelgado**: Yeah, the contract for their, their demod lighting.
**Adelgado**: So that's at 2 tomorrow.
**Adelgado**: We received our addendum permit and then for the RTU movement, it went up 30k.
**Adelgado**: So I'm working on finding another price for that.
**Adelgado**: But I need to get that figured out this week so we can make sure the units get in time.
**Adelgado**: I did get with carrier and they're saying that they don't have any units for like eight weeks.
**Adelgado**: So the ones I currently have.
**Ataylor**: They.
**Adelgado**: Can, they can get them in.
**Adelgado**: In like seven to ten days.
**Adelgado**: So, Brandon, what do you think about deem?
**Speaker 6**: I mean, I think that it's travel.
**Speaker 6**: They're probably not gonna be as cost effective.
**Speaker 6**: I mean, it's freaking Dallas.
**Speaker 6**: Like, you tell me there's not a HVC guy down there that does warehouses.
**Adelgado**: Like, I don't know.
**Adelgado**: Dean has a Dallas branch.
**Adelgado**: That's who I'm using their electrical on.
**Speaker 6**: They have a H vac Dallas branch.
**Adelgado**: Well, I, I gotta.
**Adelgado**: I'll ask, I'll ask him.
**Adelgado**: But this Rogers guy is clearly taking advantage of the situation.
**Adelgado**: And so I want to Kelly and be like, hey, I can get guys that can do it for 50 grand less and then we make more money on it.
**Speaker 6**: Yeah, exactly.
**Speaker 6**: I mean, like, I thought you were already getting other numbers besides Rogers.
**Adelgado**: I am.
**Adelgado**: I've called two guys and they.
**Adelgado**: I just started on it today.
**Speaker 6**: So Andres, I mean.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Speaker 6**: Jesse, can we get Andres to.
**Speaker 6**: To pound the phones tomorrow on that?
**Adelgado**: That'd be great for Ulta.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: Yeah, Andres, I'll get with you.
**Adelgado**: It's.
**Adelgado**: It's easy.
**Adelgado**: I just need.
**Adelgado**: I have everything else bought out.
**Adelgado**: I need an H vac guy to get me two 25 ton units.
**Njepson**: Okay, perfect.
**Adelgado**: And installed with.
**Adelgado**: With four way blow and go diffusers.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Nothing else here.
**Jdawson**: Okay, thank you, Andres.
**Adelgado**: If you go to the, the 2023.
**Njepson**: Jobs folder, you'll see I don't have this folder.
**Njepson**: But perfect.
**Njepson**: Thank you.
**Speaker 6**: Deal with them after the meeting.
**Speaker 6**: A.J.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 6**: Okay, so one thing.
**Speaker 6**: So Maria, for the GC license for Tennessee.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Speaker 6**: So can you go ahead and compile all the documents that I put in there.
**Speaker 6**: Jesse put in there and like get it all, you know, cross check it against what is what the application says we have to have make sure that we have everything.
**Speaker 6**: And then the only thing we should be missing is the, is the financial audit.
**Speaker 6**: But I want to go ahead and make sure that we have everything done and ready to roll.
**Gducharme**: Sounds good.
**Jdawson**: Make sure that's done with the folder you share with me, right, Jesse?
**Ataylor**: I believe so, yes.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Gducharme**: Okay, I'll check.
**Jdawson**: Okay, now estimates.
**Jdawson**: So novels feel Excel centered.
**Bclymer**: Andrus did the drawings on that.
**Bclymer**: Then Jesse made some markups and Andrus is going to revise them.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Something else right here.
**Jdawson**: No updates.
**Bclymer**: Right now, just the floor plan.
**Gducharme**: Okay, sounds good.
**Jdawson**: Siva Doctors and flooring.
**Jdawson**: Jesse, it was a proposal send you.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, I haven't heard anything from them.
**Ataylor**: Brandon.
**Ataylor**: I don't know if you have.
**Ataylor**: No, we're missing a couple projects here and I don't know now's the time to put them in there.
**Speaker 6**: Yeah, might as well.
**Ataylor**: Okay, so there's, there's the radial dock doors and I don't see that even in our estimating folder.
**Ataylor**: I don't know if it got mixed up with Siva dock doors, but there's radial doctors.
**Ataylor**: This is in Plains.
**Ataylor**: Is it Plains Field, Indiana?
**Speaker 6**: I think it's Plainfield or Avon.
**Speaker 6**: I can't remember which one.
**Speaker 6**: I think.
**Adelgado**: Is it the same building, Brandon?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I think it's Plainfield.
**Bclymer**: That's the one I, I visited.
**Speaker 6**: No, that's for Siva.
**Speaker 6**: So yeah, this is Avon radio.
**Speaker 6**: One would be Avon.
**Ataylor**: So radial Avon is 25028 was the date on that.
**Jdawson**: That's a new one.
**Ataylor**: It's a, an older one, but it's just never been put on here.
**Speaker 6**: It looks like radial radio Avon Doctors.
**Jdawson**: What's the number, Jesse?
**Jdawson**: He already said it's 5.
**Ataylor**: 2502.
**Ataylor**: 28.
**Ataylor**: His email said they're proceeding with that job and Andrew is going.
**Ataylor**: Seeing if he can get out there tomorrow.
**Ataylor**: And they asked to match existing.
**Ataylor**: So he'll.
**Ataylor**: He's checking the availability of our contractor.
**Ataylor**: Go out and take a look with him and then get out there and look at it.
**Speaker 6**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: And then another one is that just came up last week, call U Vest Office building.
**Ataylor**: It's not really U Vest because this guy, this is his own thing.
**Ataylor**: So I don't know if we just want to call it office building.
**Speaker 6**: I would just say, yeah.
**Speaker 6**: Tampa Office Building.
**Jdawson**: What is the state for Radial Avon, Jesse?
**Ataylor**: It's Indiana.
**Ataylor**: I believe that's Indiana.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Speaker 6**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay, what is the other one?
**Ataylor**: The Tampa office building.
**Jdawson**: What's the number?
**Ataylor**: 24 or 25 rather.
**Gducharme**: One second.
**Gducharme**: 25.
**Ataylor**: 004.
**Ataylor**: 24.
**Jdawson**: This is Florida.
**Jdawson**: And then.
**Jdawson**: Okay, what's the update on that one?
**Ataylor**: I just.
**Ataylor**: I got a reference.
**Ataylor**: Revise a plan, Send it to Andre's, sketch it up and get a budget over to him.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: Okay, perfect.
**Ataylor**: Just the order of these jobs, are we going top to bottom or bottom to top?
**Ataylor**: Because like everything else, descending order, the.
**Speaker 6**: Date should be in.
**Speaker 6**: In ascending order.
**Speaker 6**: So for instance, you know, the.
**Speaker 6**: The date should be, you know, like.
**Speaker 6**: So January 1st is top, December is bottom.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Something.
**Jdawson**: Other one, Jesse.
**Jdawson**: Other new ones.
**Ataylor**: Brandon, you sent.
**Ataylor**: We got emails and I haven't even put them in there, but there was a couple projects that came through, emails to you before you copied me on it.
**Ataylor**: I don't see them in here, and I don't remember exactly the name of them, but they were.
**Ataylor**: I think the one was something out in California.
**Speaker 6**: Yeah, that was for Ulta Beauty, I think Walter sent me that.
**Speaker 6**: Want to do an AC replacement job out there, Fresno building.
**Adelgado**: That'll be the next one for the retrofit, won't it, Brandon?
**Speaker 6**: Yeah, if they do it.
**Speaker 6**: Which it makes sense because we.
**Speaker 6**: I did the AC replacement in Greenwood and then they did the retrofit, so I imagine that's what the timeline is.
**Adelgado**: Yeah, we got to get licensed there.
**Speaker 6**: It's underneath the nascar, but yes.
**Adelgado**: Oh, California is.
**Adelgado**: That's huge.
**Speaker 6**: Yeah.
**Speaker 6**: Kind of wish it wasn't.
**Adelgado**: Why do you say that?
**Speaker 6**: It's the pain in the ass to work there.
**Adelgado**: It is a pain in the ass, but we've turned down a couple jobs out there.
**Speaker 6**: Yep.
**Speaker 6**: That's why I still have some hair left.
**Ataylor**: So what do we want to call that job?
**Ataylor**: Do you recall that email?
**Speaker 6**: Yeah.
**Speaker 6**: Just call it Ulta Beauty Fresno.
**Jdawson**: Job number.
**Adelgado**: Brandon, when does he want pricing by?
**Speaker 6**: It's.
**Speaker 6**: He sent me the email.
**Speaker 6**: At 417, it would be 25.
**Speaker 6**: 4 17.
**Ataylor**: And putting that folder and estimating right now.
**Ataylor**: 5.
**Jdawson**: No number for digup.
**Speaker 6**: What?
**Adelgado**: It'd be 25.1 7.24.
**Speaker 6**: No.
**Speaker 6**: 25.04.
**Speaker 6**: 1 04.
**Adelgado**: Yeah.
**Speaker 6**: It's.
**Jdawson**: Year.
**Gducharme**: Did you.
**Jdawson**: Can you say it again?
**Speaker 6**: It's so the way that we do these numbers is it's the year, the month, the day.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Speaker 6**: This would be 25, 4 17.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Jesse, what was the update on this one?
**Ataylor**: I'm sorry, I was on mute there.
**Ataylor**: What'd you say?
**Jdawson**: What was the update for this one?
**Ataylor**: Ulta Beauty Fresno haven't done anything but like the scope.
**Ataylor**: I don't know what we got to do, Brandon, to.
**Ataylor**: To move that forward.
**Speaker 6**: I just emailed Walter and asked him when he needs the.
**Speaker 6**: This done by.
**Speaker 6**: I asked him for drawings originally, so.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: You think?
**Ataylor**: I thought there was one other one similar to that, just a different.
**Ataylor**: Different client or different project.
**Speaker 6**: There's that one that I sent you for Terre Haute.
**Speaker 6**: But I mean, I don't know.
**Speaker 6**: I.
**Speaker 6**: I just gave him a square foot number.
**Speaker 6**: I mean, I wouldn't even create a folder yet because we don't have any deliverables.
**Ataylor**: Okay, and then was that the lady that you met with looking at doing a build out of a.
**Speaker 6**: No, that's a different franchisee.
**Speaker 6**: That's a different one.
**Speaker 6**: That is.
**Speaker 6**: I can't remember her name, but that's for a.
**Speaker 6**: A spa.
**Speaker 6**: And so I mean, we don't have any deliverables on that either.
**Speaker 6**: It was just more of a introduction call.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Turner, Tom House.
**Jdawson**: This is Elijah.
**Jdawson**: You or Andres?
**Ataylor**: No, this is Andres and me.
**Ataylor**: So we're finishing up the estimate.
**Ataylor**: We got a meeting tomorrow at 3.
**Ataylor**: I'm sorry, 2:30 with the developer and we'll give them our budget.
**Speaker 6**: Our numbers looking.
**Ataylor**: Good.
**Ataylor**: I think we're still.
**Ataylor**: What are we at?
**Ataylor**: 250 a square foot.
**Ataylor**: Somewhere around there.
**Ataylor**: Andres, we're under 260.
**Speaker 6**: That's good.
**Speaker 6**: If our bill price is 250, then that gives him plenty of margin.
**Speaker 6**: For sale.
**Ataylor**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: AJ 3150 W.
**Jdawson**: Morris Street.
**Adelgado**: No update.
**Adelgado**: I spoke with George, I think early last week, or maybe it was late.
**Adelgado**: I forget when, but they're working through some lease stuff now.
**Speaker 6**: When he met with the client.
**Speaker 6**: Was the client into it or what?
**Adelgado**: Say that again.
**Speaker 6**: When he met with a client and Gave him your proposal was the feedback from the client?
**Speaker 6**: Yeah.
**Speaker 6**: This looks good or what?
**Adelgado**: Yeah, I mean, I think it was right on par.
**Adelgado**: Like that would have been over a month ago.
**Adelgado**: I sent him a breakdown.
**Adelgado**: He said no matter what, they're going to want to do something.
**Adelgado**: It's just a matter if they can get.
**Adelgado**: I know they want to kick this one their current leasey out and so it's.
**Speaker 6**: What.
**Speaker 6**: When was the last time you talked to George about that?
**Adelgado**: Oh, let me see here.
**Adelgado**: Spoke with George in early April.
**Adelgado**: Okay, April 8th.
**Speaker 6**: Well, it says here you said the breakdown on the 14th, so I'm assuming you spoken to him.
**Adelgado**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: On the 14th and it was the last time.
**Adelgado**: I was just looking at the last time I texted him.
**Speaker 6**: Okay, why don't you try to get a hold of him and see if we can get an update, see if it's still in play.
**Adelgado**: I'll call him.
**Speaker 6**: So you can put that as a task.
**Speaker 6**: Maria, follow up with George on update.
**Gducharme**: Okay?
**Speaker 6**: Put a due date for Wednesday.
**Jdawson**: It is Wednesday.
**Adelgado**: Yeah, well, I already followed up with him now, so I'll give him a call if he doesn't answer.
**Speaker 6**: And you'll be.
**Jdawson**: Hopefully tomorrow.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Andres GW slowing reroof dc.
**Njepson**: We.
**Njepson**: We finished estimate now?
**Ataylor**: Yeah, the pricing was sent to the owner this afternoon.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Goodwill foundation.
**Jdawson**: This is Andres and Glenn.
**Speaker 7**: Yeah, the abatement's done signed for the architect to go ahead and get going on her drawings and permit set.
**Ataylor**: So you've seen the email I sent to her, right?
**Speaker 7**: If it was this afternoon, no.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Speaker 7**: Oh, here we go.
**Ataylor**: I talked to Andrew and he wants to.
**Ataylor**: He said as soon as.
**Ataylor**: Like, he just wants to see our numbers and then we'll release Emily to do her design, so.
**Speaker 7**: Oh, okay.
**Speaker 7**: Well, I got a number back from JL today and it was 1:40 for everything, I think.
**Speaker 6**: How many numbers did you get for that scope?
**Speaker 7**: They're.
**Speaker 7**: They're the main.
**Adelgado**: Well, they.
**Speaker 7**: They provide a lot of scope.
**Speaker 7**: So, like, we have Market Ready provided flooring, SNM provided Paint Vision did painting, but JNL has all of their scope plus all the framing and everything everything else.
**Speaker 6**: So how many other framing numbers did you get?
**Speaker 7**: We don't.
**Speaker 7**: Andres, we have any other framing numbers?
**Speaker 7**: We had superior say that they would do it on tnm, but they wouldn't give us a number otherwise.
**Njepson**: Nothing.
**Speaker 6**: So we have one number per division?
**Speaker 7**: I'm not saying that.
**Speaker 7**: I'm just saying that JL is the first one to give us our estimate.
**Speaker 7**: I don't know when we've given estimates to be due to people.
**Speaker 6**: Andres, when are the estimates due?
**Njepson**: Well, I.
**Adelgado**: Today.
**Njepson**: Reach out, I think so Friday.
**Njepson**: I will call him tomorrow.
**Speaker 6**: Okay, so Friday, you have all the.
**Speaker 6**: Friday, you have all the numbers due?
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 6**: Okay.
**Speaker 6**: Make sure we're getting multiple numbers for each trade.
**Speaker 6**: Like having one sub do multiple trades may seem good and easy, but the issue is a.
**Speaker 6**: That's a ton of power, and if something goes awry, then we're really screwed.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: So if you didn't get Glenn Marks, I mean, he's already looked at this price.
**Ataylor**: I'm shooting you the email.
**Ataylor**: You just need to reach out to him and get him to follow up.
**Ataylor**: And based on the new scopes, get that to you.
**Ataylor**: He did framing, drywall, etc.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: But we need to get this price to them this week.
**Ataylor**: So I would keep following up.
**Ataylor**: We're gonna have to get something to them, and then we got to look at, you know, their budget, what things we want to cut to get to their budget.
**Speaker 7**: Well, their budget is 250.
**Speaker 7**: Right.
**Speaker 7**: You know, that's what they would like to do.
**Ataylor**: Yes.
**Speaker 7**: Okay, so we got the abatement.
**Speaker 7**: I know that our.
**Speaker 7**: Our MEPs are but 25,000 for all.
**Speaker 7**: For all of it.
**Speaker 7**: So we're.
**Speaker 7**: We're at like 175 in cost.
**Speaker 7**: If we were to just use JL's number and go with that.
**Ataylor**: So you've looked at all the scopes, and they've included everything.
**Ataylor**: And we're at 175.
**Speaker 7**: Everything that JL has.
**Speaker 7**: Yeah, because they included the painting with the leads encapsulation, those columns outside.
**Speaker 7**: I looked at our number from McCurdy was about 10 grand.
**Speaker 7**: Electrical numbers.
**Speaker 7**: I thought it was like 15.
**Speaker 6**: So what he's asking Glenn, and it's a.
**Speaker 6**: It's an answer of yes or no or I don't know, is have you looked at all the scopes and everything that needs to be done in this project?
**Speaker 6**: And it's all covered.
**Speaker 6**: And it's covered for $175,000.
**Speaker 7**: I mean, it's a.
**Speaker 7**: That was a rough estimate, but, yes, about that.
**Speaker 6**: Okay, so it could be 185,000.
**Speaker 6**: It could be 200.
**Speaker 7**: Let me see.
**Speaker 7**: Let me see what we got for electrical.
**Speaker 7**: $35,000 for electrical.
**Speaker 7**: Oh, there's.
**Speaker 7**: There's all that to run.
**Speaker 6**: I thought you just said MEPs were 25,000.
**Speaker 7**: I thought.
**Speaker 7**: I thought the.
**Speaker 7**: I thought they were.
**Speaker 7**: I thought the electrical was closer to 15.
**Speaker 6**: And it's 35.
**Speaker 7**: Electrical is 35.
**Speaker 7**: It's the other two, that added up to 15.
**Speaker 7**: Plumbing and H vac, or 15, that's 50,000.
**Speaker 6**: So just.
**Speaker 6**: Yeah, it was 25.
**Speaker 6**: So that number went from 175 to 200 real quick.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 6**: That'S without GCS.
**Speaker 7**: Yeah.
**Speaker 7**: Okay.
**Speaker 7**: There's a lot more stuff in here than last time I looked at it.
**Speaker 7**: Andre's been putting some new numbers in here for sure.
**Ataylor**: That's why we're saying you got to look at what the scopes are and know everything you need done and then look through all the pricing.
**Ataylor**: Just make sure they've got everything okay.
**Ataylor**: And then things like, you know, he mentioned the cabinets.
**Ataylor**: Maybe they do them themselves later on.
**Ataylor**: So, like those are the things we gotta split out if we are over 250 with our GCS and fee in there.
**Ataylor**: And then those are the things we can split up and they'll do.
**Speaker 6**: So we've already started abatement?
**Speaker 6**: Correct.
**Speaker 7**: It's done.
**Speaker 7**: They finished on Friday.
**Speaker 6**: Where did you.
**Speaker 6**: Where did you.
**Speaker 6**: Where do you save the weekly reports at?
**Speaker 6**: In the job file.
**Njepson**: Foreign.
**Speaker 6**: I'm looking in owner reports.
**Speaker 6**: I don't see anything.
**Speaker 7**: I didn't make a weekly report for this one.
**Speaker 7**: I.
**Speaker 7**: I have daily reports in our job planner.
**Ataylor**: So you're gonna have to get one out for last week.
**Ataylor**: I mean, we're performing work.
**Ataylor**: We're gonna bill them for.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Speaker 7**: Who do I send that to?
**Speaker 7**: Just you.
**Speaker 7**: Jesse, I don't have the owner contact on this job.
**Ataylor**: I'll get you that email when you get it ready.
**Ataylor**: Just let me know.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Speaker 6**: I mean, in case nobody knows, like if we're doing work on a site, a weaker report should be going out.
**Speaker 7**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Should we move on to the next one?
**Jdawson**: This is Radial freezer demo.
**Jdawson**: This is Jesse and Andrew.
**Jdawson**: But Jesse.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, we're gonna be there on 6 May to do a site walk.
**Ataylor**: They've added some scope to move one of the tenants out of this building into another facility they have there.
**Ataylor**: So we'll be looking at that too.
**Ataylor**: Andrew's got all the subs lined up for that site visit, so we should be good to go.
**Ataylor**: Mike is gonna.
**Ataylor**: Our superintendent on Burnville, he'll go over there for that.
**Ataylor**: It's like four hour drive.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: You're in the group, aj.
**Adelgado**: No update, but I did, I did speak with Houston and I'll follow up with him, but I don't think it's going to be.
**Adelgado**: I don't think it's going to be a thing anymore.
**Adelgado**: So that's just because I guess the Owner is kind of squeezing them out on the deal too and is wanting to maybe just not do it.
**Bclymer**: I don't know.
**Adelgado**: It's kind of a.
**Adelgado**: Kind of some drama involved.
**Jdawson**: Well, should we pause it?
**Speaker 6**: No, I think what he's saying is it's lost.
**Jdawson**: Oh, so completely lost.
**Adelgado**: Yeah, I.
**Adelgado**: I don't know enough yet.
**Adelgado**: I wouldn't.
**Adelgado**: Me and Houston were talking about other projects at the time, so I.
**Adelgado**: I did ask him and he said it's not looking too pretty, so I wouldn't mark his lost yet.
**Jdawson**: So pause.
**Speaker 6**: Yeah, it wouldn't be paused.
**Speaker 6**: It's still going to be to do so and then follow up this week and let's try to get a status update.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Great Clips.
**Jdawson**: Madison, this is also you, A.J.
**Adelgado**: Yeah, I gotta get him that budget.
**Adelgado**: I started it, gotta finish it.

**Ataylor**: No, it's not.
**Ataylor**: Some of it they gave some square footage, but others they didn't.
**Speaker 6**: Yeah, I'll have to look at the other file.
**Jdawson**: Is that something else you want me to add here, Brandon?
**Speaker 6**: No, I mean it's.

**Adelgado**: But we went through our design that me and Jesse put together and we're able to delete a storm structure.
**Adelgado**: But we do have to add in an aqua swirl.
**Adelgado**: I had two other site where guys go out there and look at it, so we'll see what they say, but I haven't been spending too much time on it.
**Speaker 6**: Probably a good idea.
**Jdawson**: Okay, great clips on Shine Plaza.
**Jdawson**: Aj.
**Adelgado**: Yeah, but just got with Devon.
**Adelgado**: So we're setting up a time this meet to start getting the ball rolling on getting final drawings done on both of those out there in Springfield.

**Speaker 6**: Hoping to get an introduction I with the actual tenant.

**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: AJ stungate orthodontist.
**Adelgado**: Yeah, so I spoke with Mr.
**Adelgado**: Miller or Dr.
**Adelgado**: Miller this weekend.
**Adelgado**: He was going to take a look, get with his partner and.

**Adelgado**: How Much time do we need to set aside?
**Adelgado**: And who will we be meeting with?
**Adelgado**: So I'll tell them.
**Adelgado**: Brandon and Jesse.
**Adelgado**: You guys obviously one of you want to be on that with me.
**Speaker 6**: Yeah, I would say tell them 30 minutes.
**Speaker 6**: You know, this is just a quick introduction.
**Speaker 6**: You know, 30 minutes max.
**Speaker 6**: You know, 15 to 30 minutes max.
**Speaker 6**: You could even probably say 15.
**Adelgado**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: When is it?
**Adelgado**: I don't know.
**Adelgado**: We're gonna.
**Adelgado**: I'll.
**Adelgado**: I can see when you got at least on Brandon's.
**Adelgado**: I can see when he has time blocked out sometimes.
**Adelgado**: So I'll.
**Adelgado**: Jesse, you shoot me sometimes.
**Adelgado**: That work at the end of the day.
**Adelgado**: And I'll.
**Adelgado**: I'll get it set.
**Ataylor**: Fridays are always wide open.

**Adelgado**: I think he golfs on Fridays.
**Adelgado**: So Thursday.
**Speaker 6**: Miss, you mispronounced I.
**Speaker 6**: Oh, I definitely.
**Adelgado**: Try to golf on Fridays.
**Njepson**: He.
**Adelgado**: I know he golfs on Fridays.
**Adelgado**: He's got a standing tee time at Woodland.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: That's Donande's.
**Speaker 6**: Oh, I cracked myself up.
**Adelgado**: Notice how unfazed I am by it, Right?
**Speaker 6**: Because what are you gonna say?
**Speaker 6**: That's like being like, brandon drinks a lot of water.
**Speaker 6**: Yeah.
**Adelgado**: What do you mean, dude?
**Adelgado**: I didn't.
**Speaker 6**: Golfing.
**Adelgado**: I didn't this last Friday.
**Speaker 6**: Because you went on Thursday.
**Ataylor**: It's true.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: A.J.
**Jdawson**: corm.
**Jdawson**: Dale.
**Adelgado**: Yeah.
**Adelgado**: So putting a signed contract together for him.
**Adelgado**: I put the job in Job Planner.
**Adelgado**: It's been linked.
**Adelgado**: I put the budget in there.
**Adelgado**: I wrote my first purchase order.
**Speaker 7**: But.
**Adelgado**: For some reason, I don't think I can't send it to erp.
**Adelgado**: And that's probably just because the vendor's not synced.
**Adelgado**: I don't know.
**Adelgado**: You guys that have experience.
**Adelgado**: This would be the first thing I'm writing in Job Planner ever.
**Speaker 6**: Yeah.
**Speaker 6**: So you can get on with support and ask them, or you can.
**Speaker 6**: Can look and see if it's linked.
**Speaker 6**: You know, you have to import it and.
**Speaker 6**: And everything from.
**Speaker 6**: From the list.
**Adelgado**: Yeah, no, I know how to do it.
**Adelgado**: I'm just assuming that's why I can't push it.
**Adelgado**: So once it gets.
**Adelgado**: Once I get their W9 set up for Crossroads, it'll tell you why.
**Speaker 6**: Like, it'll give you a prompt.
**Adelgado**: Right now I'm clicking on.
**Adelgado**: Oh, it's not telling me why, but that's probably because it's a draft still.
**Adelgado**: So I click approved here and refresh still won't let me figure it out.
**Speaker 6**: Take a screenshot, send it to Job Planner support.
**Adelgado**: I'll fit.
**Adelgado**: I'll figure it out.
**Adelgado**: But, yeah, that job's rolling, so we'll I'll get it bought out here tomorrow.
**Adelgado**: I only have to write three contracts and then we'll start that work here in June.
**Speaker 6**: Do you have the budget built in there?
**Adelgado**: Yeah, it's in there.
**Speaker 6**: How much are we making?
**Adelgado**: We are making.
**Adelgado**: Oh, I just had it up.
**Adelgado**: We're making over 10.
**Adelgado**: I know that.
**Adelgado**: That's.
**Adelgado**: That's.
**Njepson**: That's.
**Adelgado**: I think we.
**Adelgado**: I listed seven and then I had like eight grand in internal contingency built in.
**Adelgado**: Plus I put dumpsters in there.
**Adelgado**: In our general conditions, we don't need any dumpsters for this portion.
**Adelgado**: So maybe make up a little money on labor.
**Adelgado**: But doubtful be able to see it.
**Adelgado**: Brandon, once I write these two contracts, I'll move stuff to the unallocated cost.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: I do still need to.
**Adelgado**: Maria, I need to.
**Adelgado**: I don't know how you move that up to a current project since it's officially a project.
**Adelgado**: I marked it as in progress when I was getting my updates in.

**Adelgado**: I tried to find it.
**Speaker 6**: I'll get that changed up.

**Speaker 6**: That's in two because that's driving up your GC significantly.
**Adelgado**: Well, and that's what I have in two for my proposal.
**Adelgado**: And so I just wanted to get it done.
**Adelgado**: So that's.
**Njepson**: Yep.
**Speaker 6**: I'll go through and look at it.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: I know it's the allegiant and it's probably because, you know, this is an in progress phase.
**Jdawson**: So once is move here, I'll change it to current because right now this is the face that we have.
**Jdawson**: You know what is.
**Jdawson**: You know, because we have only these ones.
