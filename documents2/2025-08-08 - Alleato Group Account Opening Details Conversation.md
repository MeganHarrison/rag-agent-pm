## Transcript
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I'm like, are you sure?
**Bclymer**: I'm just kidding.
**Bclymer**: No, he knows what I tell my best friend.
**Bclymer**: We've been best friends since before kindergarten.
**Bclymer**: We grew up by each other, and we laugh because we're always like, oh, well, we will always be friends because we know too much about each other.
**Bclymer**: That's true.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Looks like somebody jumped on.
**Mcalcetero**: No, that's.
**Bclymer**: No, Just fireflies.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah.
**Kgarrett**: Oh, okay.
**Mcalcetero**: I think they have it automatically set up when the time of the meeting sets start.
**Mcalcetero**: So it's kind of cool because it did that to me last time, too.
**Bclymer**: And I was like, oh, so that's something you guys have.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, that's something new for me.
**Bclymer**: That's great.
**Bclymer**: That is great.
**Bclymer**: So it's Friday afternoon, guys.
**Bclymer**: Ready for a weekend?
**Mcalcetero**: Were you a part of our last meeting or.
**Mcalcetero**: No, I don't think you were here.
**Bclymer**: No, I wasn't.
**Bclymer**: No, I was part of your last meeting.
**Mcalcetero**: So I have another customer that's got the name AJ Taylor.
**Mcalcetero**: And you guys.
**Mcalcetero**: You guys.
**Mcalcetero**: You guys have an AJ Taylor that works for you.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Mcalcetero**: And so in the last meeting, I didn't realize that somebody had forwarded him the invite.
**Mcalcetero**: And So I kept.
**Mcalcetero**: A.J.
**Mcalcetero**: taylor kept joining, but without camera.
**Mcalcetero**: So I kept kicking him out of the room thinking it was one of my other customers, and somehow the invites got mixed up, so I booted him about.
**Mcalcetero**: I booted him twice, and he came in a third time.
**Mcalcetero**: And I sent my customer a text.
**Mcalcetero**: I'm like, hey, man, I don't know what's going on.
**Mcalcetero**: This is not related.
**Mcalcetero**: And then I see your AJ's face pop up, and I realized that, okay, it's just.
**Bclymer**: That's funny.
**Mcalcetero**: Within the course of two hours, I had two A.J.
**Mcalcetero**: taylor meetings.
**Mcalcetero**: It was rare.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, that is funny.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, that doesn't happen very often.
**Bclymer**: That doesn't happen very often.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Oh, that is funny.
**Bclymer**: I wonder what AJ stands for.
**Bclymer**: I wonder what your AJ stands for.
**Bclymer**: You know, I mean, those are usually.
**Bclymer**: Maybe they even have the same, you know.
**Mcalcetero**: Oh, yeah, I don't legal name, you know, hopefully it doesn't go that.
**Mcalcetero**: That, you know, far, but it was.
**Mcalcetero**: It was quite funny, you know?
**Kgarrett**: Oh, yeah.
**Bclymer**: Like, why.
**Bclymer**: Why is AJ getting in my call all the time?
**Bclymer**: Get out of here.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, I, like, text my customer back, like, hey, I'm sorry, I met another one of you.
**Mcalcetero**: It's different one, you know, that kind of thing.
**Kgarrett**: Good time.
**Bclymer**: That's great.
**Bclymer**: That is great.
**Mcalcetero**: AJ was good.
**Mcalcetero**: Your AJ was a good sport about him.
**Kgarrett**: That's good.
**Bclymer**: He probably thought he Was doing something wrong for getting kicked out all the time going, gosh, what's going on with this team call?
**Bclymer**: Something's wrong.
**Mcalcetero**: He's like, I don't know why I keep getting, like, let in, let out.
**Mcalcetero**: It was a weird revolving door for him.
**Mcalcetero**: So, Maria, did you have any responses to the email that I had sent you guys that I'd sent over to you?
**Bclymer**: What?
**Mcalcetero**: Sir, I sent you a, like a new account setup discussion email because Brandon wanted kind of a preview.
**Mcalcetero**: Oh, yeah, I still have some of the questions.
**Mcalcetero**: Did you have any feedback on any of that or did you want to wait until Brandon joins?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I just started with him and he was like, okay, thank you for sharing it.
**Bclymer**: I'll just, you know, we'll discuss it during the meeting.
**Bclymer**: And I said, okay, you know, and then, yeah, we review everything.
**Bclymer**: So he'll join soon.
**Bclymer**: So I'm just going to turn off a little bit the camera because I need to answer the call.
**Bclymer**: But don't worry, I'm here if you guys need anything.
**Bclymer**: And my daughter is yelling as you can hear.
**Bclymer**: Well.
**Bclymer**: Oh, okay.
**Mcalcetero**: All good.
**Mcalcetero**: All good.
**Bclymer**: You're good.
**Bclymer**: So I'll just join.
**Bclymer**: Brandon will join in a few minutes.
**Bclymer**: I'll just keep you posted with everything.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Thank you, Brad.
**Bclymer**: Thank you.
**Bclymer**: Nice to meet you.
**Bclymer**: Kelly.
**Bclymer**: Nice to meet you, too.
**Bclymer**: Thank you.
**Bclymer**: So fire at Note Taker.
**Bclymer**: So they just.
**Bclymer**: That.
**Bclymer**: That FB thing just takes notes about what we're talking about.
**Bclymer**: I've never seen that.
**Bclymer**: Have you seen that before?
**Bclymer**: This.
**Bclymer**: I've been on a lot of teams calls, but I've never seen that before.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, so that's.
**Mcalcetero**: I've seen it with them.
**Mcalcetero**: Specifically.
**Mcalcetero**: I have another customer who uses a different Note Taker app, but it's some.
**Mcalcetero**: It's some artificial intelligence app that basically categorizes all the dialogue and then, wow, you know, sends it out in the file.
**Bclymer**: Sound smarter.
**Bclymer**: Hope it makes me sound even smarter than what I am.
**Bclymer**: How's that?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I, you know, they were talking about artificial intelligence at my conference yesterday and, you know, and what they're going, what's going to happen in the future in banking, you know, with it.
**Bclymer**: So it should be interesting to see.
**Bclymer**: I. I'm not that familiar.
**Bclymer**: So I have a lot to learn in that area.
**Mcalcetero**: There is a lot to learn in that area.
**Mcalcetero**: It's like, it's so crazy to see how much progress or change has been made in the industry.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I think you're right.
**Bclymer**: And I think it's a little scary, you know, on some of the Things that I've seen have been like that, so.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, I mean, I think that's fair.
**Mcalcetero**: It's certainly been a big shift from what, you know.
**Bclymer**: Oh yeah.
**Mcalcetero**: But everything has been, you know, so.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Just gotta roll with it.
**Bclymer**: Just gotta roll with it.
**Bclymer**: Got to meet my new boss today.
**Kgarrett**: Oh, nice.
**Bclymer**: It seems like he's.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, he seems like he, you know, he's had great experience and he brings a lot to the table.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, I'll be interested to meet him and see what you guys are, you know, how.
**Mcalcetero**: How that change works out then obviously we've got a lot of migration stuff too, so it'll be good to see him.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, yeah, come in a little bit before that starts.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, he went to.
**Bclymer**: It's from Busey.
**Bclymer**: Busey bank was his last.
**Mcalcetero**: Oh yeah, I saw that.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, so he's here and it's been about a half an hour with him today.
**Bclymer**: So I'll be.
**Bclymer**: Like I said, always anxious to meet.
**Bclymer**: In real life, it's a little bit different, you know, doing these things online all the time.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I did have a chance to look at their statements and you know, based upon who we are, I don't see where they have check positive pay, which I think is important and that's part of our bundle pricing like they have.
**Bclymer**: And then based on their balances, it should offset all their fees.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, I would, I would agree.
**Mcalcetero**: It's, you know, certainly a conversation that I think is, you know, easy to have given their balances and just see what.
**Mcalcetero**: What they feel like we can do the best for them.
**Kgarrett**: Pretty.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Kgarrett**: Simple.
**Kgarrett**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: It's like they got it all going on.
**Bclymer**: The only thing that I see is positive pay and then I can't tell if they do non electric.
**Bclymer**: See they have these cash management services so I'm wondering if that is their.
**Bclymer**: Hold on here debit book.
**Bclymer**: That's just like ach.
**Bclymer**: But I just wonder if they have a remote deposit.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, that was one of the questions that I asked was, you know, are there services that you guys are using?
**Mcalcetero**: So hopefully we'll get some insight there and get a good idea of what this looks like.
**Bclymer**: Are you downtown today?
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, for just a little bit longer and then I gotta put out and then pretty much working from Fishers like remotely a little bit.
**Kgarrett**: Oh, you are on Monday, so.
**Kgarrett**: Oh, little travel.
**Kgarrett**: Yeah.
**Mcalcetero**: Not at the branch.
**Mcalcetero**: No, not at the branch.
**Mcalcetero**: I have, I have a.
**Mcalcetero**: An event out in Fisher so I'll be there from like 11 to 6.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Up here in the.
**Bclymer**: The other part of the world.
**Mcalcetero**: That's right.
**Bclymer**: You know, depending on where you go in town, it's like if I'm on the north side, you know, north side or south side.
**Bclymer**: All the same stores.
**Bclymer**: It's all the same things.
**Bclymer**: Some are newer than others.
**Bclymer**: You know, I mean, you can pretty much get anything you want no matter where you go.
**Bclymer**: But when I had moved to Noblesville 26 years ago, I thought I'd moved to the country, and now we had to build a roundabout outside of our neighborhood because there was so much traffic.
**Bclymer**: So, yeah, I literally thought I had moved out to the country when we built that house.
**Bclymer**: And now you can't get out of the neighborhood.
**Bclymer**: It's terrible.
**Bclymer**: But we have everything now in Noblesville that we didn't have before.
**Bclymer**: But you probably see that in Brownsburg, too.
**Bclymer**: How long have you been in Brownsburg?
**Mcalcetero**: Six years.
**Mcalcetero**: So not long.
**Mcalcetero**: We were in Whitestown before that for about six years, and that place blew up like crazy.
**Bclymer**: You aren't kidding.
**Mcalcetero**: But Whitestone still doesn't have their own school system, so it just didn't make sense to stay there.
**Mcalcetero**: You'd have to go to Lebanon schools.
**Mcalcetero**: So that's why we really.
**Bclymer**: Huh.
**Bclymer**: I didn't know the Whitestone.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah.
**Mcalcetero**: They talked about moving into or building a high school, elementary and middle, in Whitestown, but because Lebanon school still has capacity, they didn't want to put that infrastructure cost in.
**Bclymer**: Really?
**Bclymer**: That's.
**Bclymer**: You know what?
**Bclymer**: I never knew that.
**Bclymer**: That really surprises me.
**Bclymer**: They're going to have to.
**Bclymer**: With the growth that they have there.
**Bclymer**: They're going to have to, because people aren't going to want to send their kids all the way to Lebanon.
**Bclymer**: Not that it's that far, but you.
**Kgarrett**: Know what I mean, I think that.
**Mcalcetero**: They said they won't see another impact of, like, as far as, like, a requirement to need additional schools for, like, another 10 years.
**Kgarrett**: Really?
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Then your kid will be out of school.
**Mcalcetero**: Well, I mean, yeah, for us, it doesn't matter.
**Mcalcetero**: Brownsburg.
**Mcalcetero**: Brownsburg's got a really weird setup on how they set up schools, but works out well.
**Mcalcetero**: Like, our son goes to an elementary school where Reagan and elementary.
**Mcalcetero**: Reagan elementary and Lincoln elementary share a wall.
**Mcalcetero**: So there's two elementary schools that are conjoined.
**Bclymer**: So do the Whitestown kids all go to one class or are they all integrated?
**Mcalcetero**: So the Whitestone kids all.
**Mcalcetero**: So that's us in Brownsburg, in Whitestown, they all go up to either.
**Mcalcetero**: There's one elementary school down Lebanon.
**Bclymer**: Never mind.
**Bclymer**: I'm sorry.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, but I wonder if they they're all integrated there in Lebanon then?
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, they are.
**Mcalcetero**: They just.
**Mcalcetero**: I mean, it's just about districts until they get up to high school and then high school.
**Mcalcetero**: Everybody's just mixed, you know, put in really, no matter what.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Lebanon has good.
**Bclymer**: Brownburg has a really good high school.
**Bclymer**: And then that, like I said, that town has just grown immensely in the, you know, past 20 plus years.
**Bclymer**: So now St. Malachi, that's still there, isn't it?
**Bclymer**: I remember I used to sell to there.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So if I remember correctly, they didn't have air conditioning.
**Bclymer**: I wonder if they ever got it.
**Mcalcetero**: I believe so, but I'm not as good of a Catholic as I probably should be, so.
**Bclymer**: Neither my.
**Bclymer**: I grew up as one, but I'm not.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, yeah, we go to St. Owls in Zionsville, so.
**Kgarrett**: Oh, yeah.
**Bclymer**: Ah, there you go.
**Bclymer**: So your son doesn't go to Saint Malachi, huh?
**Mcalcetero**: No, we'll go to Catholic school.
**Mcalcetero**: No, we were never allowed to.
**Mcalcetero**: Our son's adopted.
**Mcalcetero**: And so we just got done with foster care last year at this time.
**Mcalcetero**: And you're not really allowed to.
**Mcalcetero**: I mean, like, you have to really be cognizant of what you expose some.
**Kgarrett**: Of those kids, so.
**Bclymer**: I did.
**Bclymer**: I did the same thing, just so you know.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah.
**Mcalcetero**: Oh, that's right.
**Kgarrett**: That's right.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: We were foster parents and we adopted too.
**Bclymer**: So after six.
**Bclymer**: Well, it was a year before we got the adoption handle.
**Bclymer**: How long have you had your son?
**Mcalcetero**: Since he was two weeks old and he's two weeks old.
**Mcalcetero**: So it took us four.
**Mcalcetero**: It took us and a half years before he was adopted.
**Bclymer**: Really?
**Bclymer**: So his parental rights probably weren't terminated, correct?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Speaker 3**: Sorry, guys.
**Bclymer**: It's almost done.
**Speaker 3**: Sorry to interrupt.
**Mcalcetero**: Hopefully we're not distracting you.
**Kgarrett**: Yeah.
**Mcalcetero**: So a long process.
**Mcalcetero**: So it was.
**Mcalcetero**: It was my son's.
**Mcalcetero**: His biological mother.
**Mcalcetero**: It was her third child that had been removed and it took four.
**Mcalcetero**: Four years.
**Mcalcetero**: And then she's had.
**Mcalcetero**: She's got a one year old now that's also been removed and she's pregnant again, so.
**Bclymer**: Isn't that wild?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So you're not gonna get the other two.
**Bclymer**: I'm surprised they didn't call you about the other child, the one you know.
**Mcalcetero**: We got a call from.
**Mcalcetero**: But we.
**Mcalcetero**: We decided like, we.
**Mcalcetero**: If she would sign away rights, we would do it in a heartbeat just because, you know, want to make sure every kid's safe.
**Mcalcetero**: But it'd be really tough to explain to David why his brother has to go do visitation with his biological mother and then he doesn't have to do it.
**Mcalcetero**: And then she's very.
**Mcalcetero**: She has some mental health issues, so she's very accusatory.
**Mcalcetero**: And so she.
**Mcalcetero**: She would just.
**Mcalcetero**: Every time we got to court, it would be some accusation or another levity.
**Mcalcetero**: It's us, the wall.
**Mcalcetero**: Anything else in between.
**Mcalcetero**: So, like, I mean, I always had a lawyer come with us because, you.
**Bclymer**: Know, well, you're probably.
**Bclymer**: Our situation was so different.
**Bclymer**: Our thinking.
**Bclymer**: This gal came from a very nice family.
**Bclymer**: She was 16 and had my daughter.
**Bclymer**: And then one year, 40 days later, had the twins and.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And so 17 when she had the twin.
**Bclymer**: And so I finally met her, though.
**Bclymer**: I, you know, but those.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Everything.
**Bclymer**: What.
**Bclymer**: You know what?
**Bclymer**: Everything was done by the time that I got him.
**Bclymer**: So I didn't have to deal with what you dealt with, which I've heard is a tough road to hoe.
**Bclymer**: But my.
**Bclymer**: Mine was really easy.
**Bclymer**: But I finally did meet her and.
**Bclymer**: But you know what's weird?
**Bclymer**: My voice.
**Bclymer**: They have zero desire to meet her or they're 17.
**Bclymer**: Well, at the time, he was 17.
**Bclymer**: My boys will be 25 next month.
**Kgarrett**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: My daughter just turned 26, but zero desire.
**Bclymer**: And she's had other kids too, that she kept.
**Bclymer**: But my kids are just like, ah, no, because I was, you know, I was like always wondering, oh, were they going to become teenagers and be like, I'm gonna go live with my real, you know, kind of thing.
**Bclymer**: So the only thing that I regret, I didn't tell them all, you know, early enough.
**Bclymer**: I should have told them earlier.
**Bclymer**: I.
**Bclymer**: We.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, Dave clearly knows because he had to do some visitation things like that.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: No, not my kids.
**Bclymer**: That's okay.
**Bclymer**: She's looking neat now, guys.
**Bclymer**: Okay, no problem.
**Bclymer**: We're just chatting away, catching up.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, we could probably talk for hours about that bull system.
**Bclymer**: That's for sure.
**Bclymer**: I learned a lot.
**Bclymer**: I learned a lot.
**Kgarrett**: Yeah, I agree.
**Kgarrett**: Very eye opening.
**Mcalcetero**: Sure.
**Mcalcetero**: He's just waiting to wrap up his other meeting.
**Kgarrett**: All good.
**Bclymer**: No problem.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Speaker 3**: Forgive me.
**Speaker 3**: Apologize.
**Bclymer**: You're fine.
**Speaker 3**: Hey, how are you?
**Kgarrett**: For.
**Mcalcetero**: Well, you back in town or.
**Mcalcetero**: Where are we traveling at this this week?
**Speaker 3**: No, I'm in our indie office right now.
**Speaker 3**: So I will fly to Tampa after this meeting and then I'll be there for a couple days.
**Speaker 3**: Then I'll be in West Palm beach for about a week and a half.
**Kgarrett**: Yeah.
**Mcalcetero**: This is the first time I've connected with you, where you've been in the same state, so I know country.
**Mcalcetero**: No, you've been.
**Mcalcetero**: You've been in Florida a couple Times.
**Mcalcetero**: It's all good.
**Mcalcetero**: I wish I was going to Florida.
**Kgarrett**: Yeah.
**Mcalcetero**: I appreciate the time.
**Mcalcetero**: Obviously, the additional person from our team is.
**Mcalcetero**: Is Kelly Garrett.
**Mcalcetero**: She works on our treasury management teams.
**Mcalcetero**: She is gonna be kind of integral and making sure that we have everything that you guys want available to you as we go through this discussion.
**Mcalcetero**: Obviously, we have the account open, but we need to make sure that it's tailored to what you have and wanted to make sure that we got off on the right foot.
**Mcalcetero**: So I said I sent along a couple questions.
**Mcalcetero**: I think Kelly will have some input as well, and hopefully we can make you guys feel as welcome as possible as you make some transition to center.
**Kgarrett**: Perfect.
**Kgarrett**: Awesome.
**Bclymer**: Cool.
**Kgarrett**: So.
**Mcalcetero**: I guess, you know, Kelly, if you want to start your.
**Mcalcetero**: Happy to.
**Mcalcetero**: I'm happy to.
**Mcalcetero**: I had sent a long list of questions to Maria, and she said you'd had a chance to look at those.
**Mcalcetero**: Just some questions about the current status of, like, you know what?
**Mcalcetero**: You guys have a chase.
**Mcalcetero**: Here's.
**Mcalcetero**: There were some debit blocks that were listed.
**Mcalcetero**: Is there anything that we need to be aware of and make sure that we have blocked for you here as well?
**Speaker 3**: So the biggest thing, like, I'd say with that debit block stuff is what it is, is, like, so basically, like, the reason I have that is because, you know, my first year in business, I had, like, I don't know, like, a little over $100,000 stolen out of my account, you know, and so now it's at the point now where, like, somebody has to be an approved payee, you know, So I have our, you know, payroll people, like, you know, a few different things that are continued, but basically, what.
**Speaker 3**: It prevents this, because I don't know how they do it, but somehow they send, like, these test deposits, and then they attach my account to, like, a fidelity thing and drain it.
**Speaker 3**: I have no idea how they can do it, but that's the biggest thing.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Well, these fraudsters are very good at what they do.
**Bclymer**: And so we have to work together to make sure that we're protecting your money.
**Bclymer**: And that's part of, you know, my job at, you know, the bank's job and treasury management's job is to make sure that your funds are protected because they seems like they come up with something new every week to try and get in and steal your money.
**Bclymer**: I say just go to work and use all that brain power and get a job and quit stealing from people.
**Bclymer**: But again, it's a.
**Bclymer**: It's a big part.
**Bclymer**: It's a big part of what I Do.
**Bclymer**: And so I, I had a chance to take a look at your statement.
**Bclymer**: I did notice that you do have the achievement block, which is the same thing as ACH positive pay.
**Bclymer**: It's what we call it.
**Bclymer**: Just so you know, everything that you're doing at Chase is something that, you know, we can do it since here as well.
**Bclymer**: You know, an apples to apples.
**Bclymer**: Sometimes the verbiage is a little bit different.
**Bclymer**: So we call it ACH Positive pay.
**Bclymer**: And that's exactly what it is.
**Bclymer**: It is blocked so that no one can come in and withdraw any money from your accounts unless you say it's okay.
**Bclymer**: And so how we do that is, is they give at the first time that they come in to say, you know, the IRS say, wants to come in and do like a quarterly, you know, draw or something.
**Bclymer**: They can, you can say, yes, no problem for the IRS or no problem for.
**Bclymer**: I didn't see who your payroll company is, but usually, you know, the payroll company, that kind of thing.
**Bclymer**: And then that way you don't have to ever worry about that being declined or, you know what I mean?
**Bclymer**: Like, it allows them to do it every time.
**Bclymer**: So the other thing that I didn't see on here is do you have positive pay for your checks as well?
**Speaker 3**: And that's check block or what would that be?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, basically the same thing.
**Bclymer**: And what, you know, I, how I always explain it if you're not used to doing positive pay is most fraud is happening on paper checks.
**Bclymer**: And we noticed that, you know, you write quite a few checks.
**Bclymer**: And so basically what happens from there is you would send your check register to the bank, like, send your check run.
**Bclymer**: Once you do a check, you know, a check run every week, send it to the bank, then the bank keeps a copy of that.
**Bclymer**: And then as those checks come in, it is compared to your file, if you will, that says, okay, if it's different than what you would get as an email that says, hey, you said this check was for $10,000 to this person.
**Bclymer**: It's coming in here and it's saying 18,000.
**Bclymer**: Did you make a mistake or did somebody change something on your check?
**Bclymer**: Because it's really easy to, you know, get an account number and a routing number and try to send something through.
**Bclymer**: So what that does is it stops the fraud there when they're trying to remit the checks and have them paid so that you can say, oh, no, I didn't write that check, or that isn't correct.
**Bclymer**: Boom.
**Bclymer**: We don't pay it so that no money's out of Your account.
**Bclymer**: So that's the only thing that I noticed really that I didn't see, see within your statement.
**Bclymer**: So right now do you have to send anything over for your checks or what do you do to protect.
**Speaker 3**: Right now what we do is like, so we like, we print all of our checks here in the office.
**Speaker 3**: So it's through our accounting software.
**Speaker 3**: We use acumatica.
**Speaker 3**: So you know, as far as like what you're talking about, I don't know if that happens.
**Speaker 3**: Not I know accounting, like they go in and they cross reference every day every single thing that goes, you know, into the account.
**Speaker 3**: So yeah, I have no idea if that's a thing or I don't know.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I don't think so.
**Bclymer**: No, I don't believe so.
**Bclymer**: Because if this is something that the bank wouldn't know what your accounting software is doing and if you're reconciling, it's kind of after the fact.
**Bclymer**: This kind of does everything before.
**Bclymer**: So on the positive pay, it's a, it's a product, it's a fraud mitigation tool.
**Bclymer**: So all you do with that software that you have, you probably have a tab that says check run.
**Bclymer**: You know, like when you do all the checks that you can send all that information to the bank.
**Bclymer**: And so the bank is the one that's doing the cross referencing so that nothing is taken out of your account that does it, that you don't, you haven't already sent over saying that this is correct.
**Bclymer**: So if a check comes through that isn't on your list, you, you'd get an email that says, hey, like I said, this check is not, you know, you didn't have this listed.
**Bclymer**: You want this paid that way it's a lot tougher than when the check is paid.
**Bclymer**: Then all of a sudden you're out of money.
**Bclymer**: You've got to go, you know, to the police, you know, you have to go to law enforcement to report it.
**Bclymer**: We have to work with the other banks trying to get the money back.
**Bclymer**: And it just puts money out of your account and takes your time trying to run down this money.
**Bclymer**: The positive pay stops it there.
**Bclymer**: So the money is never taken, if that makes sense.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: So that is something that I would, you know, highly recommend.
**Bclymer**: It is part of the kind of checking account that, you know, you would be in the.
**Bclymer**: So it's a bundled service charge and kind of like what you have here, because I'm looking at your service charges, you don't actually pay anything because you have enough money in your account that Offsets the fees now with Chase.
**Bclymer**: And it would be the same thing if you maintain these kind of balances that I'm looking at here for it looks like I have a June's statement.
**Bclymer**: Same thing.
**Bclymer**: The.
**Bclymer**: Your balances offset your.
**Bclymer**: Any charges or fees that you might get.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: And that is included in our bundled pricing, just so you know.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, what do I have to.
**Speaker 3**: What do I have to maintain?
**Bclymer**: What you're doing now is fine.
**Bclymer**: No problem at all, you know.
**Bclymer**: I don't know.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, this was from June.
**Bclymer**: So it's, you know, the earning.
**Bclymer**: It's called an earnings credit rate is what that is called.
**Bclymer**: And so we usually do 35 bips.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: Billion bucks or what?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I'm sorry, what did you say?
**Speaker 3**: Is it like a minimum of a million dollars or what do I have to.
**Bclymer**: No, there.
**Bclymer**: It's not a minimum because the, the fee that you would have would only be like $80.
**Bclymer**: What you, what you're charged here right now is $95.
**Bclymer**: And so it's a little bit less than that.
**Bclymer**: That covers all your ACH services, wires, if you want to do that.
**Bclymer**: And positive pay, both the ACH and the check.
**Bclymer**: Positive pay.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: And I can, I don't have my calculator right here, but I can send that over to you.
**Bclymer**: Email that over to you of what you want to maintain so that you don't have any.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, yeah.
**Speaker 3**: If you'd be great.
**Speaker 3**: I think, I think Chase, it's like I have to maintain 100 grand or something stupid small.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Well, what they're saying is an average Ledger balance of $50,000 or more in deposits and investments.
**Bclymer**: So they'll take you.
**Bclymer**: I don't know if you have investments with them, but they'll take like the aggregate of all of those and just make sure that, you know, they're offsetting those fees.
**Bclymer**: And, and that, I mean, if this is a pretty typical month of what you're doing, I know that that's going to cover the amount of fees that you would, that you would possibly have.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, I mean, we're usually, I'll get to the fact maintaining, you know, 2 to 5 maybe something like that.
**Speaker 3**: I mean, right now we've got, you know, what, three or let's see.
**Speaker 3**: Oh, no, I'm sorry.
**Speaker 3**: We got 6 million in receivables, 3 million over 30.
**Speaker 3**: They're past due.
**Kgarrett**: So.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Well, let me ask you this.
**Bclymer**: You know, with those receivables that are coming in and that's, you know, quite a bit of money.
**Bclymer**: I mean, Is there any opportunity to put some of that in a money market to make a little interest for you in addition to, you know, keeping enough in your checking account to offset any balances?
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, we do that.
**Speaker 3**: Now.
**Speaker 3**: That's what 1.
**Speaker 3**: What I talked to Troy about doing with this.
**Speaker 3**: You know, first thing is, you know, is we're going to open up a money market account and probably throw some money in there, just because as, you know, like, for me to take everything and move it over in one big, you know, tranche isn't going to happen.
**Speaker 3**: It's too risky.
**Speaker 3**: You know, it's got to be a drip system to make sure that if there's any twerks or whatever, then it works out.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, you know, that it is.
**Bclymer**: You know, I always tell my clients it's a pain, you know, to change banks.
**Bclymer**: It is.
**Bclymer**: It's an undertaking.
**Bclymer**: So, you know, we work with you to try and make that as smooth.
**Bclymer**: Smooth and seamless as possible.
**Bclymer**: One of the things that makes it tough is when you're reconciling two separate checking accounts.
**Bclymer**: You know, it's like, oh, you're trying to reconcile this one, and you're trying to reconcile that one.
**Bclymer**: You know, one of the great ways to do it is just to say, okay, at the end of the month, this is how much is outstanding.
**Bclymer**: This is how much we need to leave in this account.
**Bclymer**: And then what we need to do is, you know, just start transacting out of, you know, the new center bank kind of thing.
**Bclymer**: But we can definitely help you make that a smooth transition.
**Bclymer**: Making sure your online banking is set up, making sure that all users that you have are set up correctly, that you've had training on the online banking so that you're comfortable using it.
**Bclymer**: And so that's one of the ways that makes life a little bit easier there.
**Bclymer**: Some of the other questions I think that Brad had sent you was right now, how do you make your deposits?
**Speaker 3**: Some of them are ACHs.
**Speaker 3**: And then if we get paid by check, I just, you know, deposit it.
**Mcalcetero**: You just run to the bank.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Sorry, sorry, Brad, same question.
**Bclymer**: So you do run.
**Bclymer**: So you do go to the bank now?
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, if.
**Speaker 3**: If somebody sends me a paper check.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Because one thing that you could do would be remote deposit, where you have a scanner.
**Bclymer**: And I just couldn't tell exactly how.
**Bclymer**: You know, what's your percentage of.
**Bclymer**: Do most people pay you with ach or do most people pay you with chips?
**Speaker 3**: Most big chips or ach?
**Speaker 3**: Like, you know, I got, you know, maybe a twenty, thirty Thousand dollar check and like a fifteen, like some of the small ones, you know, I get like, it's not, I'm not going to the bank every day, let's put it that way.
**Speaker 3**: I'm going.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Speaker 3**: Once a month.
**Bclymer**: Oh, okay.
**Bclymer**: Well, you know, a scanner might be a really good fit for you because one, you're busy, you know, getting, getting to the bank sometimes can be a pain.
**Bclymer**: I always say, you know, if the checks are sitting on your desk, it's better get them into your account.
**Bclymer**: Especially if we're in an interest bearing situation going on there.
**Bclymer**: In a scanner, you just scan it in and it's in your availability for the next day.
**Bclymer**: So that's something to think about too, to make life a little more, you know, make it a little bit more efficient for you.
**Bclymer**: So the check comes in on this week.
**Bclymer**: You don't have to wait till the end of the month to, you know, put it in to.
**Speaker 3**: So our, the way our business works, I don't know how much you know about this industry is we don't typically get like periodic checks throughout the month.
**Speaker 3**: Like basically it's at the end of the month we'll get a ton of payments all at once because we're billing, we're billing it at the end of each month and we're getting paid the following.
**Speaker 3**: So it's rare that we're going to get some kind of check in the middle of the month again unless they're late.
**Bclymer**: Gotcha.
**Bclymer**: Okay, I thought, I'm sorry, I misunderstood.
**Bclymer**: I thought you said, hey, I just, you know, keep the checks and go once a month.
**Bclymer**: So that's what I was.
**Mcalcetero**: No, no, no.
**Speaker 3**: I mean like I literally will have to go like once a month.
**Bclymer**: Okay, no problem.
**Bclymer**: But a scanner also just depending on, you know, how busy and it sounds like you are all over the place that if, you know, you do have a scanner, you can also let someone scan from your office and they can log in and scan and just have a bit, you know, the ability to scan but not get into the other online banking.
**Bclymer**: So you can also do that as well, if that makes sense.
**Bclymer**: That kind of keeps it, keeps it separate.
**Bclymer**: So if you have someone that wants to scan the checks for you that's they can have that ability to get into your online banking, but that would be the only thing that they would be able to see if that's something that you wanted to do.
**Bclymer**: But other than that, I think that, you know, our, right now our money market rate is 4.15.
**Bclymer**: So that's a Nice rate.
**Bclymer**: I think that probably it's as competitive as I've seen out there.
**Bclymer**: So I think that, you know, who knows what's going to happen next month or the month after that with the Fed and the rate change.
**Bclymer**: But I always say, hey, let's do it now while we have deposit rates.
**Bclymer**: I mean, I've been doing this long enough when we didn't have any rates, banking didn't have hardly any deposit rates, and no one was making any money on their money.
**Bclymer**: But, you know, let's see what we can do to make you some money on your.
**Bclymer**: Your funds.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, certainly.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: I mean, we'll have, you know.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: An extra.
**Speaker 3**: I think a few million.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: Actually pay our bills at the end of this.
**Speaker 3**: This month.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**Mcalcetero**: So happy to have that set up.
**Mcalcetero**: I guess the other question that, that comes up is, you know, are you going to need access to.
**Mcalcetero**: To wire that money out?
**Mcalcetero**: You know, when you've got bills that you do need to make payment from out of this money, is it going to be socked away for some time?
**Mcalcetero**: I mean, make sure it's easy to.
**Speaker 3**: Transfer with my money market now.
**Speaker 3**: Right.
**Speaker 3**: Like, you know, if I need it, I just literally pull it out, you know, and it's available, you know, that day or the next day.
**Speaker 3**: It could then really take a long time.
**Speaker 3**: Like, there's, there's no, not really a point where I'm like, I need a million dollars in an hour.
**Speaker 3**: Like that.
**Speaker 3**: That's not a thing.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And you, you know, you'll have ach, you know, to be able to pay, you know, use the ACH capability to pay.
**Bclymer**: But I think that, yeah, I think you're in good shape.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Mcalcetero**: I think we can make sure everything's set up, you know, and ready to go for you now.
**Mcalcetero**: We can get you.
**Mcalcetero**: Kelly and I'll talk offline and get.
**Kgarrett**: You.
**Mcalcetero**: Working to online banking access.
**Mcalcetero**: And then I guess the other question is, how did you plan on funding the account?
**Mcalcetero**: We've got it open, but we want to make sure we get the money dropped in there as well.
**Speaker 3**: They're like, I guess I need to understand what my account number is.
**Speaker 3**: Like, can I wire money or, or ACH money in there?
**Speaker 3**: Do I have to go in, in person?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I would do ach.
**Bclymer**: It's.
**Bclymer**: It's a lot.
**Bclymer**: It's much more cost effective.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: You have ACH capabilities with Chase now.
**Bclymer**: I see.
**Bclymer**: So I would just send the money that way and then that's not very expensive for you at all.
**Bclymer**: It's just what well, free at Chase, so.
**Bclymer**: But if you wire.
**Bclymer**: Wires do cost money for, you know, the people who are initiating the wire and the people receiving.
**Bclymer**: So I always say try to do ACH if you can.
**Bclymer**: The question I would, you know, a couple questions that, and I think that that was on Brad's list, is when it comes to getting you set up for online banking, are you the only person who does the banking or does anybody else need to be set up as a user or an administrator?
**Speaker 3**: I'm the only one that has full access.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Speaker 3**: Now, our accounting department, they.
**Speaker 3**: They have this ability where they can get in and view deposits and credits in the account, which is all they need as far as, like, you know, anybody being able to do stuff like, you know, it's only, only me, like, even, even, like they can get in there and they can, they can do an ACH payment to somebody.
**Speaker 3**: Right?
**Speaker 3**: They'll fill out our bank information, all that, but I have to go in there and actually approve the ach.
**Bclymer**: Good.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So that's a good thing.
**Bclymer**: So, yeah, they call that dual control.
**Bclymer**: So you would be considered the admin.
**Bclymer**: And so what would happen is, as the admin, you could determine what permissions whatever user that you have gets.
**Bclymer**: So that's no problem there.
**Bclymer**: And we can show you how to set.
**Bclymer**: I'm assuming that's how you do it now with Chase, are you the admin and you decide who gets what privileges, what specifically?
**Speaker 3**: I mean, I assume.
**Speaker 3**: I don't really know what my title is.
**Speaker 3**: I just know I'm the only one in the bank account.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, same thing.
**Bclymer**: We can do that.
**Bclymer**: Make you the admin, then you have all the control, if you will, to decide who gets to see what, who gets to do what.
**Bclymer**: And then you, of course, have the avail, you know, you have access to everything that you want to do, so you can give as much permission or as little as, you know, as needed.
**Bclymer**: I think the dual control is great.
**Bclymer**: I think it's another set of eyes on that.
**Bclymer**: And I think it's a little.
**Bclymer**: Just more, you know, kind of just makes things a little bit.
**Bclymer**: People always feel like it's another security measure, if you will, if two different people are doing it.
**Bclymer**: The other thing is, what limit would you like for your ACH in terms of daily output?
**Speaker 3**: I mean, I don't know if we have one.
**Bclymer**: You don't have a limit now.
**Bclymer**: So if you had.
**Speaker 3**: Our payroll is 100 grand every two weeks.
**Speaker 3**: Like, so, I mean, that's ach.
**Speaker 3**: And then, you know, you've Got, you know, our insurance is over 100 grand, you know, like so, I mean, I don't know, maybe our ACH is just 250.
**Speaker 3**: I'm not sure.
**Bclymer**: Okay, that's fair.
**Bclymer**: So if you did like a 250 for that and then do you ever do any wires at all?
**Bclymer**: I didn't see any in here on your statement, but that doesn't mean that you never have.
**Bclymer**: Do you ever do any?
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, we have.
**Speaker 3**: It's just rare, very rare.
**Bclymer**: Okay, gotcha.
**Bclymer**: So we can set you up so you can do the wires from your desktop.
**Bclymer**: No problem.
**Bclymer**: And we can do, you know, right now if you want to do the wires the same as the ach, great.
**Bclymer**: There's ever a day that you're going to send out more than $250,000 in ACH or wires, you would just call us and let us know and we can up that limit for you.
**Bclymer**: What the limit does is it, you know, it limits, you know, how much could be sent out in a day.
**Bclymer**: So that's another fraud mitigation tool.
**Bclymer**: So say somebody did somehow get into your online banking.
**Bclymer**: They couldn't just send anything out because one, you have dual control and two, you only have the 250, 000.
**Bclymer**: So you don't have to worry about somebody coming in and try to, you know, ach out a million dollars worth of your funds.
**Speaker 3**: So I think the biggest, the biggest thing would be like, you know, because like for instance, like, you know, I, I'm buying into one of, to a business, you know, I, it'll be three hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
**Speaker 3**: Right.
**Speaker 3**: So I will have to wire the money, you know, or transfer it from my business account to my personal and then from there, you know, to them.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Kgarrett**: Yep.
**Mcalcetero**: That'll all be pretty easy to do.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Mcalcetero**: On our platform as well.
**Mcalcetero**: You'd mentioned about having a, the, you know, our account number routing number.
**Mcalcetero**: I'm happy to provide that the account we, we have the checking account established.
**Mcalcetero**: We'll just move that over to money market status, which will give you the rate that you wanted to have.
**Mcalcetero**: But the account number will stay the same validation.
**Mcalcetero**: So would you like me to email that to you?
**Mcalcetero**: Would you like, you know, how would you like to receive that?
**Mcalcetero**: I'm happy to give it to you over the phone now.
**Mcalcetero**: So you don't.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, yeah.
**Speaker 3**: If you can just, just email it to me.
**Speaker 3**: And then what we'll do is we'll do a test deposit.
**Speaker 3**: Yep.
**Speaker 3**: And then from there go.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Mcalcetero**: And then I'll have two lists.
**Mcalcetero**: I'LL have Sheila send you an updated email to make that code change, because again, set up as commercial checking, it'll just move to money market to capture that rate.
**Mcalcetero**: So.
**Mcalcetero**: But go ahead.
**Mcalcetero**: I apologize, Kelly.
**Mcalcetero**: What was your.
**Bclymer**: Oh, no problem.
**Bclymer**: The money market is.
**Bclymer**: Is one thing.
**Bclymer**: So what, you know, what we can do.
**Bclymer**: What might be helpful for you is, you know, we have the money market, and then we have the checking account that you do, the, you know, the operating account that you do your transactions, you run your transactions through.
**Bclymer**: We can actually set it up on a sweep that it takes after, you know, you say anything over, I don't know, five.
**Bclymer**: You know, I'm just pointing over here.
**Bclymer**: 500,000 can sweep to the money market, and then it can sweep back if needed.
**Bclymer**: And so that keeps your interest, you know, getting a bigger return on your interest, and then you don't manually have to do it.
**Speaker 3**: So let me ask.
**Speaker 3**: Let me ask you this.
**Speaker 3**: So let's say that just, you know, let's say I've got whatever 3 million bucks in my.
**Speaker 3**: In my account, right?
**Speaker 3**: And so you're gonna, you know, sweep over, you know, let's just say, you know, 3.75 or 2.75.
**Kgarrett**: So, yeah, right.
**Speaker 3**: 250 left to my account.
**Speaker 3**: You know, I said just the other day, you know, I wrote, I don't know, a few million dollars in checks right at the end of the month.
**Speaker 3**: So they're all going out and they'll start hitting.
**Speaker 3**: So like, let's say that, you know, all of a sudden a $500,000 check goes to get cashed.
**Speaker 3**: Well, obviously, there's not $500,000 in my account.
**Speaker 3**: Will it automatically pull or that check get rejected?
**Bclymer**: It will automatically pull from your money market account.
**Bclymer**: So, you know, it works both ways.
**Bclymer**: So you have your PEG balance in the checking account.
**Bclymer**: Say we want to keep it at 250,000, 500,000, whatever it is.
**Bclymer**: And if checks.
**Bclymer**: And then you have 3 million in your money market, if a check comes in to be cleared for more than what you have in there, it just automatically pulls money from the money market to cover it.
**Bclymer**: And then it will always pull enough to make sure that you're at the peg balance that you choose.
**Bclymer**: So, yeah, so you don't have to.
**Bclymer**: You don't have to manually worry about, oh, my gosh, I got to, you know, try to figure out what's outstanding, you know, when should I pull it over kind of thing.
**Bclymer**: It's taken care of.
**Speaker 3**: Is there a way to, like, so, for instance, like, now, you Know, I have, you know, like, I don't know, million or so in credit line, you know, based like so, like, like just the other day, right.
**Speaker 3**: So I, I had, I pulled out 600, 000 off of it, you know, based off my receivables.
**Speaker 3**: Right.
**Speaker 3**: You know, just to have.
**Speaker 3**: Right.
**Speaker 3**: And then, but you know, like so for.
**Speaker 3**: Is there a way to tie in, you know, and say I have a million dollar line with you guys, you know, if I pulled 500,00 off that, then, you know, receivable comes in.
**Speaker 3**: Will it automatically go back and pay it or do I have to initiate that?
**Bclymer**: Well, it will.
**Bclymer**: You could do a line of credit sweep as well as a money market sweep.
**Bclymer**: So again it goes back to that peg balance.
**Bclymer**: And so what we can say is we can set it up so that anything over, you know, the peg balance and the checking account we can pay back to the line first or pay back to the money market first.
**Bclymer**: So it just depends on what you want to do.
**Bclymer**: But it is something we can do both at once.
**Bclymer**: Didn't always do that in banking, just for the record.
**Bclymer**: So that's kind of.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, relatively new, but yeah, we can now.
**Bclymer**: And so I've actually set that up here.
**Kgarrett**: Okay.
**Kgarrett**: Yeah, yeah.
**Mcalcetero**: I have some other clients that use that feature and it certainly is a big win because you're not paying interest on that balance and gets you to zero that out.
**Mcalcetero**: So you're able to kind of mitigate that expense pretty quickly.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah, it's a nice feature.
**Bclymer**: But again it's, it's making your money work for you and making, you know, so it's gonna make you some money, save you some money and it's going to save you time and it's going to protect your money with the, you know, putting that positive pay on there.
**Bclymer**: So we can definitely help you out on that end.
**Bclymer**: And if you.
**Bclymer**: I'm not sure.
**Bclymer**: Where are you located?
**Bclymer**: Well, it sounds like you're located everywhere but there in the Indianapolis.
**Bclymer**: Where are you located?
**Speaker 3**: So our office is, it's kind of like 86th street and 69 area.
**Speaker 3**: It's a office park, you know, just north of 86th Street.
**Speaker 3**: It's Craig Street.
**Speaker 3**: You know, I don't know if you.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: I'm a North Sider.
**Bclymer**: So yeah, I know exactly where you are.
**Bclymer**: Probably 86th and ditch might be the closest for you.
**Bclymer**: If you, you know, don't want to think about a scanner, we've got that, we have about 100, I don't know, 16.
**Speaker 3**: I live in Carmel So, like, usually the bank that I go to, that deposit is.
**Speaker 3**: I'll go on my way home and I'll go to the Carmel branch.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And I don't know which one.
**Bclymer**: Well, Chase, I don't know where we have.
**Speaker 3**: You guys.
**Speaker 3**: You guys have one.
**Speaker 3**: Literally, like I get off on Keystone, just north of it, you guys, and go to Carmel.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, that's where I'm sitting right now.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So, yeah, that's where my office is.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So I was just thinking about where you were.
**Bclymer**: If you like, you know, come to the bank, you know, which banking center would be closest to you.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: Again, I'm not somebody that goes often by any means.
**Bclymer**: Okay, no problem.
**Bclymer**: I just wanted to let you know that we've had something close for you then, so.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: But I think that's all the questions that I have.
**Bclymer**: So again, we can either keep the checking account that you have open or we can open a money market for you.
**Bclymer**: It just depends on timing wise, what you're thinking about in terms of moving operating account over.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, I would say do the sweep thing that you're talking about.
**Speaker 3**: Right.
**Speaker 3**: Or like assuming no matter what.
**Speaker 3**: Like at least now.
**Speaker 3**: Right.
**Speaker 3**: Like I have to have a checking account and.
**Speaker 3**: And then I also have a money market account.
**Speaker 3**: I mean, if you can just have one and it basically use the money market as a checking account, then I mean, I guess that's the best.
**Speaker 3**: I don't know.
**Speaker 3**: I've never done that or heard of it.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, like at one time you could only use money markets.
**Bclymer**: You could only make so many transactions a month, you know, going out.
**Bclymer**: You could deposit as much as you want into it.
**Bclymer**: Right now those limitations aren't on, you know, and that's a regulation, you know, from the powers that be.
**Bclymer**: Not just since your bank, but right now we have it.
**Bclymer**: You can have a money market and use it as a kind of a checking account here.
**Bclymer**: And we can add.
**Bclymer**: You know, what I need to double check to make sure we can add all the services that you need just to a money market.
**Bclymer**: I think that we can.
**Bclymer**: But usually the way I've always done it, and I've been doing this for a while, is there's a checking and then.
**Bclymer**: And a money market.
**Speaker 3**: But just double check and let me know.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I will do that.
**Bclymer**: I'll double check to say, can we add services?
**Bclymer**: So if we could add the services to the money market, great.
**Bclymer**: We can just change this product code to what you have here now.
**Bclymer**: Or we can let.
**Bclymer**: Let me look at that and I will Email you right back.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, something different.
**Mcalcetero**: I have the wiring instructions prepared for the account that we have open so we can get that stuff established so you can make that transfer.
**Mcalcetero**: The wiring instructions are gonna be the same instructions for your AC if you're gonna ACH it.
**Mcalcetero**: So that way you can do your test and get all that stuff initiated.
**Mcalcetero**: And then once Kelly and I have the discussion, we'll make sure everything's set up to where you can play with it a little bit, make sure you're comfortable with the transition.
**Mcalcetero**: And if you guys get to the point where you're comfortable, obviously we want to earn the remainder of that business.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Mcalcetero**: You know, throughout, so.
**Mcalcetero**: But I know we're a little bit over on your time.
**Mcalcetero**: Is there anything that we've missed that you wanted us to cover?
**Speaker 3**: No, I think that's the kind of.
**Speaker 3**: The broad strokes, you know, I'll look for Kelly's follow up email and we'll go from there.
**Bclymer**: Do you want.
**Mcalcetero**: You want the wiring instructions, you know, all the, all the communication to go to both you and Maria just so that Kelly's aware too, right?
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, that's fine.
**Kgarrett**: Yep.
**Kgarrett**: Perfect.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And then add me.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, let's do that.
**Bclymer**: And so I'm just.
**Bclymer**: And just to.
**Bclymer**: Just to summarize, I'm going to see if we could add, you know, ACH and all those services to your money market account.
**Bclymer**: And like I said, I just don't know because I don't usually.
**Bclymer**: And I just want to make sure before I tell you for sure that we can do that.
**Bclymer**: If not, we can always order the, you know, the money market account and the checking account, you know, and put those two together.
**Bclymer**: So I'll find out for sure and let you know asap.
**Kgarrett**: Perfect.
**Kgarrett**: Thank you.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Anything else you can think of?
**Bclymer**: I think that we got everything covered just, you know, based on your statement.
**Bclymer**: But is there anything that you'd like to see that maybe Chase hasn't talked to you about?
**Speaker 3**: I mean, you know, to be fair, like, it's, you know, I feel bad because it's not that they haven't tried to have a meeting with me or like, get lunch and everything.
**Speaker 3**: I just, I'm always like, look, I'm sorry, I don't have time to talk.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Kgarrett**: So.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, I don't know.
**Speaker 3**: I mean, you know, it's more along the lines of you don't know what you don't know.
**Speaker 3**: Right.
**Speaker 3**: Like the whole, like the whole sweep thing you just said.
**Speaker 3**: I didn't know that was a thing.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah, so.
**Bclymer**: So that's part of it.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: And when, you know, you think banking's banking loans and deposits, but there are, you know, products that it is continuously, you know, that evolving into just making life a little bit easier.
**Bclymer**: And, you know, the things that are coming out are just pretty amazing, actually.
**Bclymer**: That.
**Bclymer**: And so part of that is to keep you informed.
**Bclymer**: Those changes that can just make your life a little bit easier, a little more efficient on the banking side as you continue to grow and boom, as you're doing.
**Bclymer**: And so we want to keep you not have to spend all your time banking and so that it's kind of as efficient as possible.
**Kgarrett**: Perfect.
**Speaker 3**: Awesome.
**Speaker 3**: I appreciate it.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Oh, well, I.
**Bclymer**: We do too, so.
**Bclymer**: Okay, well, I'll.
**Bclymer**: Brad, I'll give you a buzz here in a minute and just make sure we're on the same page.
**Mcalcetero**: Sounds good.
**Mcalcetero**: Appreciate it.
