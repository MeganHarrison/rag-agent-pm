## Transcript
**Bclymer**: Hello, everyone.
**Bclymer**: How's everyone doing?
**Fnjie**: What's going on?
**Fnjie**: Adrian, how you doing?
**Bclymer**: Not too bad.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: It will be a little bit about 10 minutes late, but I think we can start with the meeting.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And then, Kevin, go ahead and share the open item list.
**Asupit**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: And then I know that we received the updated confirmation letters.
**Bclymer**: We're going to review those and start sending them out as soon as possible.
**Kjin**: So on those letters, you're sending them all out pre filled out?
**Kjin**: Correct.
**Bclymer**: So this is where is it pre filled out that we're.
**Bclymer**: You're saying that we're doing?
**Asupit**: Yes.
**Asupit**: Yeah.
**Asupit**: We will leave the response to the responders.
**Kjin**: That made zero sense.
**Kjin**: Let me ask a question again.
**Kjin**: Are we pre filling out the forms and sending them to the clients, or are we leaving them blank and saying, hey, fill this out.
**Asupit**: We leave them blank, and then we will have responder to fill out the letters.
**Kjin**: Okay.
**Kjin**: Why?
**Bclymer**: So there's.
**Bclymer**: We can do this for audit purposes, just because since this is a third party, it's better for them to correct it and update it.
**Bclymer**: So then it'll be a stronger evidence.
**Bclymer**: If we give them the numbers up front, they won't check in their systems and then they'll just agree with the confirmation.
**Bclymer**: But this forces them to kind of check their systems numbers and then put in their numbers, and then we can kind of match it with the information from Aliato.
**Kjin**: So, Adrian, are you pretty busy or you got a lot of time on your hands?
**Bclymer**: Combination?
**Bclymer**: Both, I think.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, we're a busy season at the moment.
**Kjin**: So most of these people, in fact all of them are busy.
**Kjin**: And when you send them a blank two page document and they got to go try to chase down all this information, they're not going to fill it out.
**Kjin**: So.
**Bclymer**: Sure, sure.
**Kjin**: In lieu of doing that, unless there's a reason not to, and we're after efficiency, then, hey, here's all the stuff filled out as we understand it, you know, Mr.
**Kjin**: Client, can you confirm if it's not accurate, you know, you know, please update it or let us know to change it to whatever?
**Bclymer**: Sure.
**Bclymer**: Let me talk to Iot about this.
**Bclymer**: And then we can kind of modify this based off of the efficiency and the time constraints and we'll get back to you on that portion.
**Kjin**: Well, okay.
**Kjin**: He has not here, so, yeah, I'll.
**Bclymer**: Talk to him right after the meeting.
**Bclymer**: And I think he's coming in on 10 minutes, so we can talk when he comes.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, because, Adrian, I send the letters in a Word document thinking that you guys were going to fill out the blank Spaces as well.
**Mcalcetero**: They are in Word document, but they're not as PDF because we were actually hoping for you guys to fill out those portions.
**Mcalcetero**: So they are nowhere document.
**Mcalcetero**: They're not going to be pds.
**Mcalcetero**: I mean, so just let me know the decision because.
**Kjin**: Yeah, they supposed to, are they supposed to take those, print them out, fill it in by hand, sign it and scan it and send it back like correct?
**Asupit**: Yes.
**Kjin**: How antiquated are we going to get here?
**Bclymer**: I mean it's, it's a, it's a, a normal audit process.
**Bclymer**: That's a decision to make it blank and to fill in the numbers it's based on.
**Kjin**: What's the writ?
**Kjin**: What's the writ like?
**Kjin**: Let me understand.
**Kjin**: So the risk of doing it your way is that it takes forever.
**Kjin**: Okay, explain to me what the risk of doing it my way is.
**Bclymer**: You mean pre filled out versus non filled out?
**Kjin**: Correct.
**Kjin**: Your way is the non filled out.
**Kjin**: Okay, correct.
**Kjin**: My way is pre filling it out and having them, you know, confirm or correct.
**Bclymer**: For the verification.
**Bclymer**: If they put in their numbers, right.
**Bclymer**: And then after that it matches to your system, we will feel more confident as to.
**Bclymer**: Since we didn't pre fill it and they actually filled it directly, we will feel more confident that the numbers are accurate.
**Bclymer**: And.
**Kjin**: So the risk, from what I'm understanding and I'm, you know, it's being very pointed.
**Kjin**: Okay, you're saying that if we pre fill it out, the risk is that you feel like they will lie and say it's accurate when it's not.
**Bclymer**: Possibility.
**Bclymer**: We don't know if it's going to be a related party.
**Bclymer**: We don't know if it's is there, is there?
**Kjin**: So there's that risk.
**Kjin**: Is it possible that on the blank form they lie or it's a third party or all that stuff and it's not accurate as well.
**Bclymer**: And that's where then the communication between two parties come, come into play, where then they agree.
**Bclymer**: Yes, actually this is the number.
**Kjin**: And it's possible the answer to that question is yes.
**Kjin**: Okay, it is possible.
**Kjin**: And so what we're talking about is the same risk with either option.
**Kjin**: The difference is yours is going to take forever, mine is going to be efficient.
**Bclymer**: Same risk.
**Kjin**: So the risk is what you just told me, okay, is the risk of it being filled out is that the client will lie and say it's accurate when it's really not.
**Kjin**: They have the same risk if it's blank.
**Kjin**: He can put whatever on there and lie and say it's accurate and it's the Same thing.
**Kjin**: So you have the same risk with both options.
**Bclymer**: Well, this one, where if they do have a separate number compared to yours, and we don't know if they're lying or not.
**Kjin**: Right.
**Bclymer**: And we don't know if you're lying or not.
**Bclymer**: That's where you guys are combining together to get an actual number.
**Bclymer**: So if your number is correct and they'll correct their records and like, yes, we agree.
**Bclymer**: And then I've.
**Bclymer**: In their side.
**Bclymer**: No, these numbers are our numbers.
**Kjin**: Well, here's what we're going to do.
**Kjin**: We're going to fill it out and send it to them and say, please confirm if this is accurate.
**Kjin**: If not, please, you know, let us know what changes.
**Kjin**: Or it's an editable form, whatever.
**Kjin**: But we're filling it out and sending it to them because your way is not going to work.
**Kjin**: None of these guys are going to take the time to do that.
**Kjin**: I looked at the form myself, and you're talking to guys like me.
**Kjin**: They're like, I don't have time for this.
**Kjin**: I don't know who this EI guy is.
**Kjin**: It doesn't.
**Kjin**: You know, I have no idea.
**Kjin**: Like, it's going to get pushed to the back burner.
**Kjin**: But if you make it simple and say, hey, please confirm this is accurate, it's going to get done.
**Kjin**: Like, this is an audit for a license in a state that we clearly meet the financial goals of.
**Kjin**: This is not an audit to go do some public job where we've got a.
**Kjin**: Where, you know, if the numbers are wrong, everybody's going to jail.
**Bclymer**: Sure.
**Fnjie**: Brandon, I, I get where you're coming from, and I agree with you.
**Fnjie**: I just, I want to make it clear here that, like, MGO is not doing anything outside of typical audit practices.
**Fnjie**: Although very efficient.
**Fnjie**: I think you should sit in an audit board and you'll probably have a great time telling them.
**Fnjie**: A lot of things that are required in audit are very inefficient.
**Fnjie**: So let's talk to IYAD about this.
**Fnjie**: And, you know, I, I get where Brandon's coming from.
**Fnjie**: This could cause massive delays and having these companies, they're.
**Fnjie**: They're probably not going to do it.
**Fnjie**: A lot of them, and it's going to push this very, very far.
**Fnjie**: So let's just get AOD on the same page, hopefully on this.
**Fnjie**: But Brandon, just so you know, like, I've been through many and this is, like, customary to do, and it does take a long time.
**Kjin**: I, I have no doubts that it's customary and it's the way it's Always been done and that's wonderful.
**Kjin**: But we are not in the business of just doing things the way that everybody's always done them ever.
**Kjin**: Like, let's think outside the box, let's innovate, let's improve.
**Kjin**: Like let's just, let's think about this.
**Kjin**: Let's ask the question why, what are the risk?
**Kjin**: Like are we really eliminating any risk with either option?
**Kjin**: Like let's actually just do the top process of like, oh, we've always done it this way.
**Kjin**: And again, if you tell me, which is why I asked you, oh well, we have to do it this way because if we don't then the world will collapse because of xyz.
**Kjin**: Like, oh, okay, that makes sense.
**Kjin**: But what you told me, the risk is the same for both.
**Kjin**: The only issue is one doesn't take a lot of time and one does now.
**Kjin**: If there's other things, please educate me.
**Fnjie**: Well, from MGO standpoint, taking, taking inefficiencies out of the window here and just saying from a attestation standpoint, what they're trying to achieve, which I believe you're aware of already, Brandon, is that they don't want any bias into this document.
**Fnjie**: And when we're pre filling there is a higher risk when MGO signs an audit that, that, that may have been something they just sign or confirm and the numbers are pre filled while if they go and get it themselves and there's a discrepancy.
**Kjin**: So let me ask you there, like the risk, like you said, is the MGO signing an audit and you know, we pre filled it out and the client is signing that and saying yes, these numbers are accurate.
**Kjin**: And so then the risk is the NGO is therefore signing that assuming that they are telling the truth and they could be lying.
**Kjin**: So I guess I don't understand and this is maybe my simple mind, if they are signing and attesting that this is accurate, how does that make a risk on mgo?
**Bclymer**: The risk is, is that they might just be biasedly, like I said, confirming and actually the mounts is not correct where hey, the percentage completion, they're just looking at it and they're like oh yeah, they say it's 90%, okay, we have it 85 or 60%.
**Bclymer**: Let's just agree with it.
**Bclymer**: Maybe they want to reduce kind of like the challenges, right that disputes of any, any kind of disputes and so it's better.
**Kjin**: So I don't, I don't know, I.
**Bclymer**: Don'T know if you had communications with them too where just letting them know that hey, these Numbers.
**Fnjie**: I do get that part.
**Kjin**: Right.
**Fnjie**: Even if he had communication, it's a blank form.
**Fnjie**: They could still fill it out and.
**Kjin**: Yeah, I can literally call them and say, here, fill this out.
**Kjin**: Like, what do you mean?
**Kjin**: I could literally just take the documents that we created pre fill it out, send it to them myself, have them sign it and they send it back.
**Kjin**: Like so the risk is going to be there, what I'm asking you.
**Kjin**: And you dodge the question.
**Bclymer**: But one thing is we also, we also do a full, what's called check to see if the email that you provide is accurate.
**Bclymer**: We look at their LinkedIn, we looked at their companies to make sure that they're independent.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: So okay, so if you're telling them please sign this numbers and please complete this, they shouldn't because they would be, I guess, ethically incorrect.
**Kjin**: Correct.
**Kjin**: Yeah, but like again what my question was, if they are signing it and saying, yes, this is accurate, then I guess what is the risk to mgo?
**Kjin**: Because these guys, like when you turn it in and say yes, this matches, like and they go back and you know, whatever, somebody somehow wants to go look at it and say, oh, Vargo, you know, you were actually 85, you said it was 90% and you sign this document saying it was accurate.
**Kjin**: That.
**Kjin**: How does that go to your guys's fault?
**Kjin**: They are attesting that this is accurate.
**Kjin**: That's on them.
**Bclymer**: So yeah, just came in.
**Evliao**: What are we talking?
**Bclymer**: We're talking about the pre fill confirmations.
**Bclymer**: Brandon wants them to be pre filled just to make it more efficient and more effective.
**Evliao**: On which confirmation?
**Bclymer**: On all confirmations.
**Kjin**: The two page letter thing.
**Evliao**: If that's.
**Evliao**: Yeah, if you guys want to go ahead and pre fill it out.
**Evliao**: We were just trying to save you guys time.
**Evliao**: If you guys want to go ahead and do that, great, no worries.
**Kjin**: Yes.
**Kjin**: Because the clients will take forever to do it, but they won't even do it, so.
**Evliao**: Yes, that's right.
**Kjin**: Great.
**Kjin**: Awesome.
**Evliao**: We thought signing 11 confirms was enough work for you guys.
**Evliao**: But if you guys want to go ahead and update the numbers and all that, go ahead.
**Kjin**: Yeah, we will get it all filled out and accurate and then we will send it out for them to confirm.
**Evliao**: Yeah, just make sure to send it back to us so we can make sure all the numbers agree to what we have as well.
**Kjin**: And let's send it out before we send it out.
**Kjin**: Right.
**Evliao**: Before we send it out.
**Evliao**: Right.
**Kjin**: Awesome.
**Evliao**: And then Brandon, did you want to, did you want, did you want us to send it out and CCU and you can reply Back.
**Kjin**: Um, we can do.
**Kjin**: We can do that.
**Kjin**: What The.
**Kjin**: The reason that I, I.
**Kjin**: That worries me is that when you guys send an email, there's a strong chance it goes to junk.
**Kjin**: And then the threads in junk versus I send an email.
**Kjin**: They all know who I am.
**Fnjie**: Would it be possible to.
**Fnjie**: To.
**Fnjie**: For Brandon to send it out and CC you guys as the audit or CPA on the email so you guys are in there and it comes from Brandon, or are you guys not comfortable with that?
**Evliao**: The.
**Evliao**: Let's go ahead and do that.
**Evliao**: I'll make the.
**Evliao**: I'll make it work.
**Evliao**: Usually we have to have full control, but ccs and then let.
**Evliao**: Let us take it from there.
**Evliao**: If they respond back, they have a question.
**Evliao**: Let us take it back.
**Evliao**: Brandon, send the initial one.
**Evliao**: That's fine.
**Kjin**: All right.
**Kjin**: Yeah, I'll send it and just, you know, see whoever wants to be sent on it.
**Kjin**: And then so puts it.
**Kjin**: Hold on.
**Kjin**: Bria.
**Kjin**: Fatima, are you able to populate all those forms or who's going to do that?
**Justin**: I gave all the information to Maria, so she.
**Justin**: She has it.
**Mcalcetero**: So, Fatima, there are some things on the formal letters that they send yesterday as a template.
**Mcalcetero**: I'm going to send one for you and just let me know because everything is ready on the.
**Mcalcetero**: On the accounting folder.
**Mcalcetero**: And then.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, everything.
**Justin**: You.
**Mcalcetero**: You have all the contacts and everything, Brandon.
**Mcalcetero**: So that's good.
**Mcalcetero**: So I'm gonna hit right now and send that to you, Fatima, so we can move this forward.
**Kjin**: Okay?
**Justin**: Okay, sounds good.
**Kjin**: All right.
**Asupit**: All right.
**Fnjie**: What else do we have on here?
**Kjin**: Thank you, Ion.
**Kjin**: I appreciate that.
**Evliao**: Absolutely.
**Evliao**: M.
**Evliao**: What else we got?
**Evliao**: Adrian, you're muted.
**Evliao**: I can hear you from the door, but I can't hear you here.
**Bclymer**: All right, I'm back.
**Evliao**: Kevin, I hear you too.
**Evliao**: Over there, but you're muted over here.
**Asupit**: Yep.
**Asupit**: Cat.
**Asupit**: Cash.
**Asupit**: This is the question for Fatima.
**Asupit**: Actually, I requested a separate call on Tuesday, but let me check this.
**Asupit**: Cash.
**Asupit**: Okay, so this is the 2023 Writkin workpaper.
**Asupit**: Fatima.
**Asupit**: And then this 3:15,000.
**Asupit**: This ties to the bank statements.
**Asupit**: And then I guess this is the reconciled items which.
**Asupit**: Including the outstanding check and deposit in transit, right?
**Justin**: Yes, yes.
**Asupit**: So if we total them up, we should tie to the trial balance.
**Asupit**: But this is not.
**Asupit**: And then what I noted here is but which is fine.
**Asupit**: If we have the variance, we can post the pje.
**Asupit**: But what we wanted to make sure is in each reconciled items what are included in this.
**Asupit**: And then I guess those are all the details.
**Asupit**: And I've noticed that we have couple of journal entries which is not actual check we paid and check we will receive.
**Justin**: Yeah, unfortunately, I don't have the answers to those questions.
**Justin**: Those happened in 2023.
**Asupit**: Yeah.
**Asupit**: So in this, if those reconciled items are not like actual check received, extra check, we're gonna pay.
**Asupit**: I guess we need to book the entries to match those balance to the bank statements.
**Kjin**: So let me understand this correctly.
**Kjin**: The 57,000, you're asking what?
**Asupit**: That's for 15?
**Asupit**: 57,000.
**Kjin**: What are you.
**Evliao**: Row 19.
**Asupit**: Row 19?
**Asupit**: Yes.
**Kjin**: Okay.
**Asupit**: Looks like we just posted our manual entries.
**Kjin**: That means that that's where we paid somebody, Right?
**Kjin**: That's a journal entry.
**Kjin**: And you're asking who?
**Asupit**: Looks like we pissed.
**Kjin**: Yeah, I'll double check here real quick, but if memory serves me correct, that went to a sprinkler company.
**Kjin**: We had to pay direct, a vendor, so a sub of a sub.
**Kjin**: We had to pay direct via wire because they were behind.
**Kjin**: And I will pull up the wire right now to confirm.
**Evliao**: Looks like there was two of them.
**Kjin**: Yeah.
**Justin**: And if.
**Justin**: If you look below on and row, like 31 through.
**Justin**: Yeah, those.
**Justin**: It looks like they kind of offset.
**Justin**: They offset those because those are in it as receipts and the other ones are in it as, like, disbursements.
**Kjin**: Yeah, that's.
**Kjin**: That was just where I think they did, like a credit adjustment or whatever.
**Kjin**: Because it was.
**Kjin**: Yeah, but so it's.
**Kjin**: It's a net.
**Evliao**: So a net zero, Kevin.
**Asupit**: It's not that net zero.
**Asupit**: We have two subtraction here, and then we have three additions.
**Asupit**: So one of them.
**Evliao**: One of them June 20th, one of them in June.
**Evliao**: That's it.
**Evliao**: Just one.
**Kjin**: It would have been income or.
**Kjin**: Or not.
**Fnjie**: Expense.
**Fnjie**: Expense.
**Kjin**: Yeah.
**Kjin**: Okay.
**Kjin**: I'm almost certain I know exactly what this is.
**Fnjie**: Or actually.
**Fnjie**: Wait, no.
**Asupit**: Oh, it would be the deposit.
**Fnjie**: Yeah, there's three.
**Fnjie**: There's three receipts and two disbursements.
**Fnjie**: So, yeah, it would be a net deposit.
**Evliao**: Kevin, as Brandon looks that over.
**Evliao**: What.
**Evliao**: What.
**Evliao**: What does our TB balance come out to?
**Evliao**: What's the trial balance say?
**Bclymer**: It's lower than the.
**Justin**: Like 255 or something.
**Asupit**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: I think we just PJ it for sake of time, because we did confirm that amount.
**Evliao**: Yes.
**Evliao**: Yes.
**Asupit**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: We're going to PJ it, I think.
**Bclymer**: Is there anything that would.
**Bclymer**: The risk of getting it lower than 2?
**Bclymer**: Something, though.
**Bclymer**: And would that be material from what.
**Evliao**: Can't go lower than what's on the bank statement?
**Evliao**: That's for sure.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Based on activities.
**Asupit**: Yes.
**Justin**: So.
**Justin**: So one thing I would say is that this.
**Justin**: This.
**Justin**: This was the 2023 bank REC as of 2024 December we have corrected the bank reconciliations.
**Justin**: The outstanding items are correct.
**Justin**: Everything dies out.
**Justin**: So I don't know if you guys making an adjustment.
**Justin**: If you make an adjustment in 2024, it will throw off GL balance for.
**Evliao**: The December 2023 MGL.
**Evliao**: Can we pass on this and move on?
**Asupit**: Okay.
**Asupit**: Yep.
**Evliao**: All right.
**Evliao**: Perfect.
**Asupit**: So AR is.
**Asupit**: Looks like Maria uploaded the confirmation letters for all the revenue but not AR yet.
**Asupit**: We are still waiting for that.
**Asupit**: And then I think the update too.
**Bclymer**: Is to have it pre filled now.
**Asupit**: Yes.
**Asupit**: Right.
**Evliao**: So Maria, are you clear on what.
**Evliao**: What you and Fatima are going to do there?
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah.
**Mcalcetero**: So I saw the blank spaces.
**Mcalcetero**: So I just sent to Fatima.
**Mcalcetero**: I sent to you one of the letters for the templates you GU shared yesterday.
**Mcalcetero**: So we need to move forward with that one for the ars.
**Mcalcetero**: Not sure.
**Mcalcetero**: I didn't see any.
**Mcalcetero**: That's the templater you guys sent Yesterday from the 2023.
**Mcalcetero**: The ones you sent.
**Asupit**: There were three AR letters uploaded in the smartsheet.
**Asupit**: A selection.
**Asupit**: Smartsheet.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I also sent it to you via email in my response.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, because I don't have access to that file.
**Mcalcetero**: So Fatima has to be sharing with me everything.
**Justin**: She doesn't have access to the smartsheet.
**Mcalcetero**: Exactly.
**Bclymer**: Oh, okay.
**Bclymer**: I did send an email.
**Bclymer**: Let me send an email right now.
**Evliao**: Somebody, somebody please give her access right now.
**Evliao**: And for the AR confirmations, Maria, please use the ones that Adrian sent you via email yesterday.
**Mcalcetero**: Yes, okay.
**Mcalcetero**: I have them here.
**Justin**: Okay, good.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Mcalcetero**: And then Fatima, I'll get back to you because again we need to fill out more things together.
**Evliao**: So.
**Justin**: Okay, we.
**Evliao**: I really would like to get confirmations out today.
**Kjin**: I don't think there.
**Kjin**: There shouldn't be any issue with that.
**Kjin**: Right.
**Kjin**: We know all the numbers.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Asupit**: Oh, Maria, actually you have the access to the smartsheet.
**Mcalcetero**: Oh, I don't.
**Mcalcetero**: I don't know.
**Mcalcetero**: When I try to log in, it didn't.
**Mcalcetero**: The only one that I showed you.
**Evliao**: It's in your email, Maria.
**Justin**: It's in here.
**Justin**: She has access.
**Justin**: Access to the PVC list, not the selections.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, because I sure every.
**Mcalcetero**: I share everything with Fatima because we were working on this together.
**Asupit**: This one.
**Justin**: Right.
**Justin**: She only sees.
**Justin**: Yeah, yeah.
**Mcalcetero**: So every time I click on the other ones I don't see it.
**Asupit**: And this is a selection smartsheet.
**Bclymer**: I think it's fine.
**Bclymer**: I think she has it in VA box.
**Kjin**: Okay, Maria, just log in as me if you need to.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, I will.
**Justin**: Yeah, fine.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: So AR confirmations will go out today.
**Asupit**: Okay.
**Asupit**: And then, Fatima, we are still waiting.
**Asupit**: 2023 trial.
**Asupit**: Updated trial balance.
**Justin**: Yes, I just downloaded the most recent one.
**Asupit**: I'll send it to you.
**Asupit**: Yeah.
**Asupit**: And then please also provide the corrected PP roll forward schedule.
**Asupit**: Looks like this PP roll forward sch is in line with our previous version of the trial balance, 2023.
**Justin**: So.
**Justin**: What do you mean the corrected one?
**Justin**: It's not correct?
**Asupit**: I mean, so we're going to update our trial balance, right, for 2023.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Justin**: This matches the updated one.
**Asupit**: And then looks like we accelerated all the depreciation expenses in 2023, which is not correct.
**Justin**: Scroll down a little bit.
**Asupit**: Yeah.
**Asupit**: So we don't have.
**Asupit**: See.
**Justin**: Yep.
**Justin**: Because the purchase date was November 2023.
**Justin**: So we depreciate.
**Justin**: Depreciation started in December.
**Evliao**: I think Kevin's question is, he doesn't see depreciation.
**Asupit**: And then we don't have any during the 2023 we.
**Evliao**: So after Kevin, she's saying it was purchased in November.
**Evliao**: So depreciation started in December.
**Asupit**: Okay.
**Evliao**: And so in 2024.
**Evliao**: You should see more.
**Evliao**: See more depreciation.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Justin**: Which is right there.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Asupit**: So when we received the updated TB, we expect to have only one month depreciation in 2023.
**Justin**: In 2020?
**Justin**: Yes.
**Justin**: In 2023.
**Justin**: Yes.
**Asupit**: Okay.
**Justin**: You'll see the rest in 2024.
**Asupit**: Yes.
**Asupit**: Okay, that makes sense.
**Kjin**: That's for the Wagoneer, right?
**Justin**: I believe so.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Kjin**: Yeah, about that.
**Kjin**: In the year.
**Kjin**: Yep.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Asupit**: One GMC and one chip, I guess.
**Justin**: And just the Jeep and the other one were in.
**Justin**: In 2024.
**Kjin**: No, no, the.
**Kjin**: The Wagoneer.
**Kjin**: The Jeep Wagoneer I bought in 2023.
**Kjin**: At the end of the year, it was like, begin.
**Kjin**: December 1st or whatever number.
**Kjin**: The other two.
**Kjin**: Yeah, there you go.
**Kjin**: The other two were in 2024.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Asupit**: Okay.
**Evliao**: Got it.
**Evliao**: September 2024.
**Evliao**: Yeah, it's a.
**Evliao**: It's a 2023 model.
**Asupit**: 2023 model.
**Evliao**: Got it.
**Evliao**: All right, let's move on.
**Bclymer**: Fatima, quick question.
**Bclymer**: What is the capitalization policy of the company?
**Bclymer**: Just for.
**Justin**: We depreciated it for five years straight.
**Evliao**: What Adrian's asking of what number do you.
**Evliao**: Do you depreciate?
**Evliao**: Like anything below 5,000.
**Evliao**: You just expense.
**Evliao**: Like that's.
**Justin**: They don't have a policy.
**Justin**: They were all over, you know, 10,000.
**Justin**: So we just appreciated a straight line.
**Evliao**: Yeah.
**Fnjie**: So, yeah, policy's 10,000 and over going forward in 24.
**Kjin**: @.
**Fnjie**: I'm guessing that's what we were kind of abiding by.
**Evliao**: That's fine for 24.
**Evliao**: We're good.
**Asupit**: And then the next one is Once we receive 2023 TB, I guess this unrecorded liability for 2023 has been properly updated.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Asupit**: Okay.
**Justin**: Yeah, we've.
**Justin**: We've recorded the accrual for 2023 for that one and the other one, we recorded the accrual for 2024.
**Asupit**: 2024.
**Justin**: So, yeah.
**Justin**: And for that amount, the actual.
**Justin**: The second one, the actual amount is 11,004.
**Justin**: 400.
**Justin**: Because there is.
**Justin**: There is retainage.
**Justin**: So the payment you pulled was just that amount minus the 10% retainage.
**Evliao**: That's fine.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Justin**: So I will send you an updated 2024 as well with all of that in there.
**Asupit**: Okay.
**Asupit**: Yep.
**Asupit**: We would check.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Justin**: And with those.
**Justin**: Since I recorded.
**Justin**: Since we accrued it and recorded the job cost in 2024, the WIP adjustments slightly changed.
**Justin**: So I recorded that as well.
**Asupit**: Yep.
**Asupit**: Okay, let us check first and then if.
**Asupit**: For any questions, I will get back to you, Fatima.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Asupit**: Yeah.
**Asupit**: So this is again, this is for 2023 trial balance.
**Asupit**: Once we receive it, we will check it and then.
**Asupit**: Yep.
**Asupit**: So revenue is just.
**Asupit**: Contract confirmation is still pending for payroll walkthrough.
**Asupit**: We do receive the November payroll register.
**Asupit**: But, Maria, if it's possible, could you please provide US any random one employment letter that we issued in 2024 and then any random one, like termination letters that.
**Asupit**: That was incurred in 2024 as well.
**Mcalcetero**: So this is for.
**Mcalcetero**: You're talking about payroll?
**Asupit**: Yes.
**Mcalcetero**: So, okay.
**Mcalcetero**: It's only to ask Amanda for that because I don't have access to it.
**Mcalcetero**: Brandon, do you have access to that?
**Kjin**: I don't say that.
**Kjin**: Say that question again.
**Kjin**: I think what he said was he wants an offer letter and a termination letter.
**Justin**: And a termination letter.
**Asupit**: Yeah.
**Kjin**: Of an employee.
**Asupit**: Of the employee.
**Asupit**: Yes.
**Asupit**: Just a random one should be fine.
**Kjin**: Yeah.
**Evliao**: Assuming that you signed it.
**Evliao**: Brandon, just send us one.
**Evliao**: Just send us an example.
**Kjin**: Yeah.
**Kjin**: So, yeah, you said 2024.
**Mcalcetero**: Yes, yes.
**Kjin**: Yeah, we'll.
**Kjin**: I know we've got some higher letters.
**Kjin**: I'm.
**Kjin**: I'd have to look on the termination.
**Kjin**: I'm not sure on that.
**Kjin**: If we.
**Kjin**: If we terminate anybody in 2024, if.
**Evliao**: There'S no termination, then just say no termination, we're done.
**Kjin**: Gotcha.
**Kjin**: Yeah, I'll get you an offer, offer letter signed and then I'll double check on the termination, but I don't think we have any.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Do we want to go into detail about the.
**Bclymer**: The cost testing happened?
**Bclymer**: I know I sent some questions.
**Bclymer**: Fatima.
**Bclymer**: We just wanted to see how some of our selections ties up to the Support that was provided.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Justin**: You said you sent me a question.
**Evliao**: Adrian, you're muted.
**Bclymer**: No, I just said.
**Bclymer**: Yes, I did.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Justin**: Was it an email?
**Justin**: Because I don't think I saw that.
**Bclymer**: It was an email.
**Bclymer**: Let me resend.
**Evliao**: You sent it 11:32pm Your time, Fatima.
**Justin**: Okay, I just saw that.
**Asupit**: Yep.
**Asupit**: What?
**Asupit**: What?
**Asupit**: Okay, so this is the.
**Asupit**: I tried to update our status for each provided samples in selection Smartsheet.
**Asupit**: I noted that couple of the uploaded files are not in.
**Asupit**: Not in alignment with the actual selection number our selections.
**Asupit**: So for example, looks like we have already covered the third samples, but we looks like the supporting document.
**Evliao**: Kevin, can we show.
**Evliao**: Kevin, can we show her an example and ask the question?
**Asupit**: Yeah, let me see.
**Evliao**: Just the exact example from the.
**Evliao**: From the email.
**Bclymer**: Email.
**Evliao**: We already have it off the top of my head.
**Asupit**: From the email or.
**Evliao**: Adrian, if you're familiar with it, you want to go ahead?
**Bclymer**: Sure.
**Evliao**: So it looks like selection number one.
**Kjin**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Selection number one.
**Bclymer**: We have it at 180,000, 614.
**Bclymer**: And I think the provided support is this item right here.
**Bclymer**: First question is, how do we get to that 180,000 support?
**Bclymer**: How does that tie to the.
**Bclymer**: To our selected amount?
**Justin**: Can you move over to the next page?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, sure.
**Bclymer**: And it could be just the wrong one.
**Bclymer**: I'm just not sure.
**Kjin**: Ask that.
**Kjin**: Ask the question again and I'll answer it again.
**Evliao**: So the question is we selected a cost.
**Evliao**: It was for 180k.
**Evliao**: We wanted the invoice, the PO.
**Evliao**: Whatever the support behind it is.
**Evliao**: We got something that does not show 180k.
**Kjin**: So you.
**Kjin**: So you selected.
**Kjin**: Okay, we paid a sub 180,000.
**Evliao**: Yeah, it looks like CC concrete.
**Kjin**: Okay.
**Kjin**: And so go back to the payout.
**Evliao**: For Earthwork and Site U.
**Evliao**: Something.
**Kjin**: Yep.
**Kjin**: Okay, so what that's going to be is because CC Concrete Excavating is.
**Kjin**: Is the same company, two different contracts.
**Kjin**: So they have ex.
**Kjin**: Excavation.
**Kjin**: Hey, aj.
**Kjin**: Aj, come here.
**Kjin**: They have an excavation side and a concrete side.
**Kjin**: Hey, CNC Concrete.
**Kjin**: And for Crate Escapes, the excavation company, they're the same entity, correct?
**Evliao**: Concrete.
**Evliao**: Yes, same entity.
**Kjin**: Same entity.
**Kjin**: We just wrote two contracts.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Evliao**: Because one, their divisions are totally set.
**Evliao**: Gotcha.
**Kjin**: Okay.
**Kjin**: So does that compute?
**Evliao**: Well, it looks like we just have it for one.
**Asupit**: Sorry.
**Asupit**: Looks like.
**Asupit**: Yes.
**Asupit**: So the.
**Asupit**: The supporting documents that was uploaded to the sample one, which is this support this PDF file.
**Asupit**: Actually, this is the supporting documents for selection number three.
**Asupit**: That's what we noted.
**Kjin**: So.
**Kjin**: All right.
**Evliao**: So, okay, the question is, where is the 180k?
**Evliao**: In an invoice or a PO.
**Evliao**: That's what we got.
**Kjin**: Okay, so you're.
**Kjin**: You're asking for the total contract value.
**Evliao**: Clearly, Kevin, it's not this.
**Evliao**: So we're asking if you can please provide the 180k invoice or PO.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Justin**: Okay, I'll go back and look at it.
**Kjin**: Yeah, there's two.
**Kjin**: There's two CNC concrete contracts.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So Fatima, I guess double check, because we did check on a few of these and we weren't able to tie out directly.
**Bclymer**: I think just double check to make sure that what we receive matches up to the 180,000.
**Bclymer**: If it's multiple POS or one PO, just make sure that it matches up to this.
**Bclymer**: Because I didn't know if you.
**Bclymer**: It was connected to your system and then that's what you received.
**Bclymer**: This is what popped up and you just uploaded it.
**Bclymer**: But please double check if it's matches to.
**Kjin**: You know, you guys could have picked like the worst job because even whenever I saw that contract written, I was like, what the hell are we doing?
**Kjin**: Why are you writing two contracts?
**Kjin**: Just do two line items.
**Kjin**: So just lucky.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Justin**: And like the second one, I can tell you what the second one is.
**Justin**: I uploaded the first whip.
**Justin**: The second one you have in the email.
**Justin**: I uploaded the first whip where you guys asked that since the jobs ended in they.
**Justin**: They started in the following year to reclass the cost that we had in the prior year to 2024.
**Evliao**: I'm sorry, which one?
**Evliao**: What are we talking about now?
**Evliao**: Which one?
**Bclymer**: So selection two.
**Bclymer**: So the one that says.
**Bclymer**: Also we see a lot of attached.
**Evliao**: Excels, which is schedule one for 87K.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Evliao**: Okay.
**Evliao**: For 87K, that was recorded on 1124.
**Evliao**: We recorded a cost for 87K and 24.
**Evliao**: But Fatima, you're saying related to 23.
**Justin**: Yes.
**Justin**: So that if you look at the Excel.
**Justin**: The Excel is our old whip, where you said.
**Justin**: Okay, since it's.
**Justin**: It's 2023 costs, let's remove it, move it from 2024 and put it to 2023 and reverse it in 2024 to have the cost in 2023.
**Evliao**: Okay, fine, no worries.
**Evliao**: So, but this 87K, let's just start with where the invoice of the PO of it is.
**Justin**: It's the cost.
**Justin**: It's a bunch of invoices and a bunch of pos.
**Justin**: Yeah, that is just the lump sum that I had to reclass.
**Evliao**: Understood?
**Evliao**: Understood.
**Evliao**: So do you have the detail behind the 87k?
**Justin**: I have to go back and look for it, but that might be Very hard to find because it's a bunch of transactions.
**Evliao**: What.
**Kjin**: What is the.
**Kjin**: Are you supposed to be sharing your screen?
**Kjin**: Because I'm not seeing anything.
**Bclymer**: I can share it again.
**Kjin**: What's the 87k?
**Kjin**: I can probably answer it pretty quick.
**Evliao**: Goodwill Excel Center.
**Kjin**: Okay.
**Kjin**: Southeast.
**Evliao**: I can't tell from the screenshot.
**Kjin**: That's fine.
**Kjin**: I can tell it's 23.
**Kjin**: Yes.
**Kjin**: That's 3147.
**Kjin**: Okay.
**Kjin**: And now that's.
**Kjin**: You're asking.
**Kjin**: That's a.
**Kjin**: That's a cost or that's a income.
**Evliao**: So it's cost, but we just need that she.
**Evliao**: Fatima, is saying it's a lump sum of many, many invoices or POs.
**Evliao**: And so we got that number from somewhere.
**Evliao**: So do we have the detail behind it?
**Bclymer**: Kevin, I think you have the detailed listing of how we made our selections.
**Bclymer**: Can we.
**Bclymer**: Can we show the number selection?
**Bclymer**: 32.
**Asupit**: Let me see.
**Asupit**: Okay.
**Asupit**: Jason.
**Asupit**: Yeah.
**Asupit**: Define that.
**Asupit**: Okay, give me just one second.
**Kjin**: So.
**Evliao**: I'm sorry, 15 minutes.
**Justin**: I will have the detail because I uploaded a spreadsheet that had 2024 transactions.
**Justin**: Or 20, 20, 23.
**Justin**: 2023.
**Justin**: You know, transactions with.
**Justin**: With a pivot of all the detail that made up those items.
**Justin**: So I can.
**Justin**: I can find the transactions.
**Justin**: I just don't know if the invoices will be available to match it.
**Evliao**: Okay, so we have two issues here.
**Evliao**: One is we got to make sure it's recorded in the right year.
**Evliao**: And then two, we're going to pick one of the invoices that make up this 87,000, and then we'll get the invoice for that.
**Evliao**: But we.
**Evliao**: If we don't have the invoice for that, we need to know.
**Evliao**: So we'll.
**Evliao**: We'll send that as soon as practical, please.
**Evliao**: And it sounds like this.
**Evliao**: Adrian, this is a pervasive.
**Evliao**: Or.
**Evliao**: Kevin, this is a pervasive across some of our selections.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: A few of them has that attach.
**Bclymer**: Excel.
**Evliao**: Okay.
**Evliao**: So the explanation, Fatima, is that it was moved from one year to another.
**Kjin**: Yeah.
**Evliao**: So we don't know.
**Evliao**: We don't need the.
**Evliao**: We don't need the WIP schedules, the width, this, the.
**Evliao**: The old ones.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Evliao**: We're not concerned about.
**Evliao**: We're only focusing on the current one.
**Evliao**: So for our.
**Evliao**: Any selection that we've made, we need a P.O.
**Evliao**: or an invoice.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Kjin**: Bettina, if you need me to go.
**Kjin**: If you need me to go, like, through.
**Kjin**: I mean, because honestly, a lot of the you guys are saying is way over my head.
**Kjin**: So if you.
**Kjin**: After this call, if you.
**Kjin**: Whatever these are, you can get on call with me, dumb it down to my level, and I can probably find all of these.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And then EOD, for when she says it's a bunch of POs, do we just need to get a listing and test one of them, or do you want to test all of them?
**Evliao**: Okay, just.
**Evliao**: Yeah, get the detail behind it and select one of them.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so to clarify, we just need to get the detail of if that's a bunch of POs or invoices, and we're just going to randomly select one of them, and you can provide that support.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Evliao**: So you put it as 11:24.
**Evliao**: So I'm sorry, one more time.
**Evliao**: Is this a.
**Evliao**: Is this a cost that's related to 23 or 24?
**Justin**: It's related to 23, but it was.
**Justin**: I think it was recorded in 24, but Brandon had confirmed that I believe the job ended in 23.
**Justin**: Right on this.
**Justin**: Goodwill.
**Justin**: Goodwill Excel.
**Kjin**: Is the.
**Kjin**: Is the job number 23114?
**Kjin**: Yeah, that ended in, like, it.
**Kjin**: No, that started.
**Kjin**: That's.
**Kjin**: Yeah, that started in 23, ended in, like, August 24th.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And so the question is.
**Bclymer**: Is because that's part of the population for 2024, and you're saying it's supposed to be 2023 costs.
**Evliao**: Well, no, he said.
**Evliao**: He just said it started in 23, but it ended in 24.
**Justin**: Ended in 24.
**Evliao**: Like, there were costs in 24.
**Kjin**: And really.
**Kjin**: And this is what I told her.
**Kjin**: Like, like, we started design at, like, the end of 23.
**Kjin**: Like, no actual cost hit until, like, February of 24.
**Evliao**: That's a.
**Kjin**: That's.
**Evliao**: Actually, I had a question when you mentioned that the other day, Brandon.
**Evliao**: When you start designing, and let's just say, hypothetically, a, your customer says, hey, you know what?
**Evliao**: After you guys started design, you know what?
**Evliao**: We don't want to move forward with this project anymore.
**Evliao**: Are they required to compensate you for what you've already done?
**Kjin**: It depends.
**Kjin**: So typically what we do is, like, so when a job comes in.
**Kjin**: We had a job the other day, so it comes in the date it comes in to look at, gets the year, the month, and the day, and then it goes.
**Kjin**: And then.
**Kjin**: So that's a 25 job.
**Kjin**: Now, if it goes through and, you know, the repricing, blah, blah, it may not kick off till 26.
**Kjin**: It's going to keep the 25 number because that's what it started at.
**Kjin**: Now, sometimes we go and we might start some upfront stuff.
**Kjin**: We'll do some Costs and the job goes away.
**Kjin**: And that's just the cost of doing business.
**Kjin**: Sometimes it happens.
**Kjin**: I'm a firm believer in we would deliver such a good product, people are going to beg to pay us.
**Kjin**: So it does happen.
**Kjin**: It's rare, but it does happen.
**Evliao**: Okay.
**Evliao**: All right, fair enough.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Justin**: So on that job, I have a note saying to move the cost that shows up.
**Justin**: Showed up in 2023 to an asset.
**Evliao**: In 23.
**Evliao**: It was an asset.
**Justin**: Yes.
**Evliao**: Okay.
**Evliao**: And that's correct because while the design and everything started in 23.
**Justin**: Right.
**Evliao**: He never started construction or services or whatever until 24.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Justin**: So this entry was to move it because it was already in the cost.
**Evliao**: It was in cost in 24.
**Evliao**: And he moved it into an asset in 23.
**Justin**: It was a.
**Justin**: It was in cost in 23.
**Evliao**: It was a cost in 23.
**Evliao**: And you moved it to an asset.
**Justin**: To an asset in 23.
**Justin**: Yes.
**Evliao**: Okay.
**Evliao**: I guess what's confusing us is it's dated 1124 and that's how we made the selection to begin with.
**Bclymer**: So one thing.
**Bclymer**: Go ahead and share your screen, Kevin, so we can show our selection.
**Bclymer**: So this population does tie to the cost of sales.
**Bclymer**: So ultimately it has been booked in 2024.
**Bclymer**: Highlight our selection on the P L.
**Bclymer**: On the P L.
**Bclymer**: On the P L.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**Justin**: So I moved it to a cost in.
**Justin**: In 23.
**Justin**: I moved it to an asset in 23 and recognized the cost in 24.
**Justin**: That's why you see that one one 24 entry.
**Kjin**: Got it.
**Kjin**: Yes.
**Evliao**: And that, that's what you should have done.
**Evliao**: That's correct.
**Kjin**: Yeah.
**Evliao**: Perfect.
**Evliao**: So there you go.
**Evliao**: Ngo, we just.
**Evliao**: That.
**Evliao**: That is, we can dual purpose use it for 23 and 24.
**Evliao**: 23 asset tests.
**Evliao**: 24 P&L tests.
**Evliao**: That make sense.
**Bclymer**: Okay, that's perfect.
**Bclymer**: Maybe in the smartsheet.
**Bclymer**: Fatima, can you put a note in a comment say that that's if any of our selections say.
**Bclymer**: Please comment if that's the case for our selections.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Evliao**: Or if there's a way of recognizing like as you have here, reclass RC ls.
**Justin**: Yes.
**Evliao**: Is there.
**Evliao**: You did that for every one of those.
**Evliao**: That was an asset in one period and then a cost in another.
**Justin**: Yes, I did that for all of them and I added the job number.
**Evliao**: Okay, so like in your row five.
**Evliao**: Kevin, that 156, that was a 2023.
**Evliao**: 158.
**Evliao**: Sorry.
**Evliao**: That was a 2023 asset.
**Evliao**: Right, Fatima?
**Evliao**: And then it was a cost on the P and L and 24 and 24.
**Justin**: Yes.
**Evliao**: Okay, so MGO make sure don't make more selections for our asset in 23.
**Evliao**: These are examples where we dual purpose.
**Evliao**: We don't need more selections and more work.
**Evliao**: Okay.
**Asupit**: Yes.
**Evliao**: Okay, so we don't need Fatima to do that because she already diligently did that in the description right there.
**Bclymer**: Okay, noted.
**Bclymer**: The RC LS 2023 cost.
**Bclymer**: All right, so I guess for cost, like I mentioned, Fatima, just double check whenever you upload it to make sure it matches to our.
**Bclymer**: And then the ones that have multiple, first give us a listing of what makes up that, that entry and then we'll, we'll select within it and then you can, if, if it's possible.
**Bclymer**: If a selection does have multiple entry entries, you can probably put in a comment too saying that this is multiple entries because that will prompt us to select within it.
**Justin**: Okay, so all of those, all of those ones that say reclass will have multiple entries.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, and that's where we will see about that when we look into the details.
**Bclymer**: And then we expect to have like a, a detailed listing of that what makes up to that account amount.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So I guess for Kevin and the team, we'll start sending out our confirmations once it's updated, when it's pre filled and then we're going to update our selections in the smartsheet to show what's been completed and what's still pending.
**Bclymer**: So then it'll be helpful for you, Fatima, to see what's been fully completed and what's still open.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Evliao**: On the spreadsheet that you just had, Kevin, where it said reclass rcls, can you filter by rcls and then show Fatima exactly which ones are batch costs that will need underlying detail for.
**Evliao**: So we can expedite this as much as possible.
**Evliao**: So go to description filter, but just type in rcls.
**Evliao**: Okay.
**Evliao**: And those three, those are the only three we made selections for that had.
**Evliao**: Is that right, Kevin?
**Evliao**: You're muted.
**Bclymer**: No, there's probably more because that's just one tab of John.
**Justin**: There's, there's more, but I can find it.
**Justin**: I know what they are.
**Evliao**: Okay, perfect.
**Evliao**: Thank you, Fatima.
**Evliao**: All right, and then if you don't mind, we're going to be checking Smartshee, but as you upload that, just tag us so we can know exactly when it's up there.
**Evliao**: So we can do the sub selection if you will, right away.
**Justin**: Okay, we'll do.
**Evliao**: All right.
**Evliao**: Big, big week, everybody.
**Evliao**: We gotta get, we gotta get this done.
**Kjin**: Yep.
**Kjin**: They'll get everything filled out.
**Kjin**: I'll sign it.
**Kjin**: We'll send it over to you guys firm and then send it out to everybody.
**Evliao**: Excellent.
**Evliao**: Thank you, everybody.
