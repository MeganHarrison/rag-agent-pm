## Transcript
**Ataylor**: What's up, Jesse?
**Blake.schneider**: Hey, good morning.
**Ataylor**: I think Alex may have canceled this reading.
**Ataylor**: I was just hopping on just in case.
**Blake.schneider**: Except for subs.
**Blake.schneider**: Why would he.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, we don't have anybody on site right now.
**Ataylor**: Just electricians.
**Ataylor**: We don't have a permit.
**Ataylor**: I know he.
**Ataylor**: I know he's called and talked to everybody.
**Ataylor**: I have a meeting today with the architect at 3.
**Ataylor**: Try and push this thing along.
**Blake.schneider**: What's holding the permit up?
**Ataylor**: This ADLS amendment.
**Ataylor**: Who's Joanna now?
**Ataylor**: Hey, Joanna.
**Brianj**: Hi, aj.
**Brianj**: Good morning.
**Ataylor**: Good, good.
**Ataylor**: How are you doing?
**Brianj**: Oh, doing great.
**Brianj**: Staying busy.
**Brianj**: How are you?
**Ataylor**: That's a good thing.
**Brianj**: Absolutely.
**Brianj**: You've been good, aj?
**Ataylor**: Yeah, I've been good.
**Ataylor**: We're definitely staying busy.
**Ataylor**: Hopefully we're one of the ones keeping you guys busy, so.
**Brianj**: Heck yeah.
**Ataylor**: Do you have confirmation on other subs joining?
**Blake.schneider**: I got Tim here.
**Blake.schneider**: I spoke to Rafael.
**Blake.schneider**: I spoke to Mike Spalding.
**Blake.schneider**: I spoke to Mike Warren.
**Ataylor**: So we just need to make sure guys are.
**Ataylor**: Are joining here starting next week, assuming we have that permit.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, so.
**Ataylor**: So, Joanna, I'll give you just a quick update.
**Ataylor**: We still don't have a permit, obviously.
**Ataylor**: I know you guys are the only ones in there working.
**Ataylor**: Starting to run pipe.
**Ataylor**: I've logged your RFIs.
**Ataylor**: I have a meeting today with the architect and the engineer at 3.
**Ataylor**: So I'm hoping to get you an answer on.
**Ataylor**: Really the one thing on your submittals I just need some quick approval on.
**Ataylor**: Is that even demon meter or whatever you want to call it, the sub meter, and then I'll get that released for you.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: But obviously lighting was released, so once I have that, I'll send those out hopefully here today.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Brianj**: Okay, thank you.
**Ataylor**: And other than that, do you foresee any issues, long lead items?
**Brianj**: No, I don't.
**Brianj**: I mean, we have the lighting on order and then we.
**Brianj**: We did order the gear as well, so.
**Brianj**: So, yeah, those.
**Ataylor**: I told Pavel just to order it.
**Brianj**: Okay.
**Brianj**: Yep.
**Brianj**: So, yeah, I'm not.
**Brianj**: Not concerned about the lighting controls or the floorbox power pole.
**Brianj**: But of course, as soon as I get those estimated updates, I'll let you guys know.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: So the one thing I did want to chat about, I had revealing meeting with FedEx and so I need you to unfortunately reduce your scope a little bit.
**Ataylor**: So our scope.
**Ataylor**: And it's not clear in their documents.
**Ataylor**: Right.
**Ataylor**: But they said that they're having their own electrician just run stuff from our junction boxes.
**Ataylor**: So I found that out.
**Ataylor**: I confirmed that last week with them and then I had another meeting here.
**Ataylor**: It was a quick call With Neiman.
**Ataylor**: And so that being said, I need to know what that deduct would be.
**Ataylor**: So we're just bringing everything basically to the wall so we're not having to run all that conduit underneath the tables and actually connect their equipment, if that makes.
**Ataylor**: Does that make sense?
**Brianj**: Yeah, everything that's, like, within the cash wraps.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, all of that stuff.
**Ataylor**: And I know there's, like, power poles going from the ceiling.
**Ataylor**: Like, they're gonna do all that.
**Ataylor**: We're just providing them junction boxes at the ceiling.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, that's where I would.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, that's.
**Ataylor**: That's where I saw it, and that's what I told him.
**Ataylor**: So.
**Blake.schneider**: Okay.
**Brianj**: Okay.
**Brianj**: Yeah, I'll get with Pavel, and I'm sure he might have a couple more questions, but, yeah, we can definitely work on that.
**Ataylor**: Have him call me.
**Ataylor**: So.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, I know it.
**Ataylor**: I know we had added that last minute before when we noticed that.
**Ataylor**: And then now they're saying we just need to give them junction boxes.
**Ataylor**: So I had even submitted their drawing for our permit.
**Ataylor**: So all ours consists of is running Dunkin boxes in the wall for them to connect to, and then they'll take it from there.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: What's up, Tim?
**Blake.schneider**: What's up?
**Jdawson**: You working?
**Ataylor**: I'm always working.
**Jdawson**: You and me both.
**Ataylor**: Love it.
**Ataylor**: How's everything going inside there?
**Jdawson**: Oh, just one pipe at a time, you know, dropping racks.
**Ataylor**: What did we find out on that data that that wall pass through we have?
**Ataylor**: I know when it gets back into the back area.
**Ataylor**: You were saying, we're gonna have to work around some stuff.
**Ataylor**: Do we have a plan for that?
**Blake.schneider**: Yeah, we're gonna.
**Blake.schneider**: 45.
**Blake.schneider**: We're gonna cut the pipe short, like where the freezers are.
**Blake.schneider**: 45 up over the H vac duct, and then into the back, and then turn 90 and head towards the room.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Sounds like a plan.
**Ataylor**: Any questions for me?
**Jdawson**: Nope.
**Brianj**: I mean, I guess slightly off topic, but is that here Emporium.
**Brianj**: Do you foresee that coming next, or is that one kind of unclear?
**Ataylor**: It's very unclear.
**Ataylor**: They got to find another tenant.
**Ataylor**: That tenant backed out.
**Brianj**: Got it.
**Brianj**: Got it.
**Ataylor**: But the job's ours.
**Ataylor**: I know that.
**Ataylor**: So nice.
**Ataylor**: Once they get that space filled, we'll hop into that.
**Brianj**: Yes, sir.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: All right, guys, Short and sweet.
**Ataylor**: Alex, make sure everybody's on it next week, okay?
**Blake.schneider**: Yeah, I'm gonna send an email out about it.
**Ataylor**: David Team, thank you for being there.
**Jdawson**: You're so welcome.
**Ataylor**: All right, see you guys.
**Brianj**: Thanks, A.J.
**Brianj**: bye.
**Blake.schneider**: Let.
**Ataylor**: Me.
