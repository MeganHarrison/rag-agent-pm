## Transcript
**Ataylor**: Good.
**Ataylor**: Almost had that baby last night.
**Ataylor**: I was at the hospital.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, really?
**Ataylor**: I was at the hospital till like 1am and then they sent us home.
**Speaker 1**: Really?
**Ataylor**: She's having like a blood pressure scare and this late in pregnancy, they.
**Ataylor**: I don't know.
**Ataylor**: So it'll be any minute now.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, for these, for the storefront jobs in the estimating folder, any of the emails that I had back and forth with subs, I, I have saved right here.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: And these are like the layouts.
**Ataylor**: So are we like changing any of the structural or are we just switching storefront out?
**Ataylor**: There's some framing involved.
**Speaker 1**: There's various things, I guess I didn't have all the layouts saved.
**Speaker 1**: I'll go in and save them.
**Speaker 1**: So I've been sending these to each sub.
**Speaker 1**: Like electrical.
**Speaker 1**: I was sending this one, but in Bloomington.
**Speaker 1**: This is going to be framing and drywall.
**Speaker 1**: And then this is a door, which CIH sent us a quote for.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: And also, Indy Superior Sentos, I think, for framing, drywall.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, yeah, we would need electrical.
**Speaker 1**: We don't have that yet.
**Speaker 1**: For on the smoke detector and for power to the door.
**Speaker 1**: Then also we need to see if the sprinkler heads, if any, need to be added right here.
**Speaker 1**: So there's that one.
**Ataylor**: We probably have to add one.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I would think so.
**Ataylor**: On that other side.
**Ataylor**: So you said this is the one in Bloomington?
**Speaker 1**: Yes, that's Bloomington.
**Ataylor**: Who are our.
**Ataylor**: Who are our framers down there doing the Bloomington job?
**Speaker 1**: Landmark.
**Speaker 1**: I sent it to them, but they didn't get back to me on that.
**Speaker 1**: I think maybe it's too small.
**Speaker 1**: So this is.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, it would just make sense if they're already.
**Ataylor**: If they're already down there, just go pop over and do that, wouldn't it?
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, there's.
**Speaker 1**: There's three jobs, so I don't know if we're gonna have to hire a different sub for each one or if like Indy Superior bid all the drywall and framing on.
**Speaker 1**: On these three jobs, I was thinking it might be easier to just have them.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: So this is Indianapolis on Chateau and Ave.
**Speaker 1**: This is an Excel Center.
**Speaker 1**: So it's a.
**Speaker 1**: It's a school.
**Speaker 1**: They want us to add a window right here, which Diamond Glass did price.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: But we need to get a price for this countertop.
**Speaker 1**: It's going to be like a desk.
**Speaker 1**: And I figured they're going to need a receptacle probably under this desk for working.
**Speaker 1**: And then they're adding this closet right here.
**Speaker 1**: So we might need to modify fire sprinkler and maybe need to add our receptacles per cone.
**Speaker 1**: And I forgot to ask CIH to price this door, but we, we could just maybe plug something in.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, I think we can plug on that for sure.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: And then so that's this, it's just the closet and the window.
**Speaker 1**: So we have to demo, demo and kind of reframe this wall.
**Ataylor**: Right.
**Speaker 1**: There are photos of the existing conditions.
**Speaker 1**: Maybe it's under photos.
**Speaker 1**: That's where it is.
**Ataylor**: Oh, nice.
**Ataylor**: Shelbyville.
**Ataylor**: That's way out there.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So that, that's the second one.
**Speaker 1**: And then this third one, we're moving this back to here and we're adding a window.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: So we have to modify.
**Speaker 1**: There's a countertop existing.
**Speaker 1**: We have to modify and then we have to build out a wall right here.
**Speaker 1**: Build out a wall virginity.
**Speaker 1**: Superior price than diamond glass price this window.
**Speaker 1**: And I don't think anyone, I'm not sure if any superior price Moving back this existing storefront.
**Speaker 1**: You'd have to clarify that.
**Ataylor**: So it is, it's existing storefront now.
**Ataylor**: So the, the wall we're building is just that where the window's located.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, we're moving.
**Speaker 1**: This is existing.
**Speaker 1**: We're moving it back here.
**Ataylor**: It'd probably be a job that diamond would do.
**Ataylor**: They can move stuff like that.
**Ataylor**: Or I have another guy.
**Ataylor**: That may be cheaper too, but you're more.
**Ataylor**: How, how soon are they wanting to move on all this?
**Ataylor**: Probably pretty quick.
**Speaker 1**: I, I, this has been pushed off for a long time.
**Speaker 1**: Like initially Andrus was working on it and he didn't really get anywhere.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Speaker 1**: And I've just been too busy.
**Speaker 1**: So it's been pushed back.
**Speaker 1**: And I'm telling him, telling Goodwill that I'll have pricing at the end of next week.
**Ataylor**: That gives us plenty of time.
**Ataylor**: That's better than usual.
**Ataylor**: Usual.
**Ataylor**: It's like, hey, we got to get them pricing in four days.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, yeah.
**Ataylor**: So good work there.
**Speaker 1**: And I, I have estimate templates for each one.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Are you thinking that we give them just like a lump sum price for all three of them?
**Speaker 1**: They might want it individually.
**Ataylor**: Individually, yeah.
**Ataylor**: So what, what are our gaps on pricing then?
**Ataylor**: What do we need coverage?
**Ataylor**: I mean there's like the minor like the door and all that.
**Ataylor**: We can plug numbers for that.
**Ataylor**: You know, for adding ahead.
**Ataylor**: It's going to be 2500 bucks.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: All the email pricing is in this folder right here.
**Ataylor**: Have you, have you typed up a clarifications yet?
**Speaker 1**: No, I haven't.
**Ataylor**: Do you have capacity to get that typed up here by the end of the week, you think.
**Speaker 1**: For each sub, you're saying.
**Ataylor**: No.
**Ataylor**: It's always the hardest part when you're putting a proposal.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: To the owner.
**Ataylor**: So we get.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I could do that.
**Speaker 1**: If you can get the pricing together, I can do the clarifications sheet.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: Get that done.
**Ataylor**: And then I can.
**Ataylor**: I can look at that and I can fill in the gaps.
**Ataylor**: So I'll start reaching out to some guys and.
**Ataylor**: And like I said, something this small, Google's such a good client, we can just plug and chug numbers and then, you know, buy it out when we gotta.
**Ataylor**: When they say go.
**Ataylor**: You know what I mean?
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: You work on the clarifications.
**Ataylor**: I can get the estimate, and then we'll see where we're at here at the end of the week.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, that works.
**Ataylor**: Work for you?
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: All right, man.
**Ataylor**: Let me know if you need anything.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, thanks.
**Ataylor**: See you.
**Ataylor**: Bye.
