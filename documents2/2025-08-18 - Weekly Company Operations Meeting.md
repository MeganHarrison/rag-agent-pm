**Bclymer**: Hi.
**Gducharme**: Okay, guys, so let's go through this.

**Gducharme**: Okay, you can go.
**Jdawson**: Ulta Dallas.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we're just.
**Jdawson**: We're just waiting on a response from the city of Dallas.
**Jdawson**: We went live last week, and so our scope there is done.
**Jdawson**: I'm gonna work on getting the final PSR done.
**Jdawson**: They still haven't issued a PO for this RTU fix we're gonna do, so we haven't done any work there, but that job's pretty much wrapped up.
**Bclymer**: AJ on the.
**Bclymer**: Just going over the financials of the TEMA and for Ulta Dallas, like, all that, the ULTA work for the H VAC units is complete.
**Bclymer**: Correct.
**Jdawson**: But, yeah, it is.
**Bclymer**: We have no committed cost for any of that work.
**Jdawson**: I owe Rogers a change order for it.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so just.
**Bclymer**: You need to send us a note on how much.
**Bclymer**: How much cost?
**Bclymer**: Total will be.
**Bclymer**: Needs to be allocated for that, because currently it just shows like, that's all profit.
**Jdawson**: Right?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I'll balance it here, Jesse.
**Bclymer**: We'll balance it right on the change.
**Jdawson**: Order to get it done.
**Jdawson**: So once I issue the change order, then on that final psr, that should all be balanced.
**Jdawson**: So I'll knock it out for you.
**Bclymer**: Okay, thanks.
**Ataylor**: Thank you.
**Ataylor**: Ag Critscape.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, so the Westfield punch list items are happening this Friday.
**Ataylor**: Don't forget to.
**Jdawson**: You can take this job off because we've been paid in full.
**Ataylor**: So complete.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I mean, you could leave it up there.
**Jdawson**: I mean, we.
**Jdawson**: We have to get.
**Jdawson**: I guess we have to maintain for the next three years the ride away in Westfield.
**Jdawson**: It's a new thing that they passed.
**Bclymer**: But.
**Jdawson**: I don't know.
**Jdawson**: I never signed anything.
**Gducharme**: Don't forget to send the pictures of credscapes to me, please.

**Ataylor**: I'll.
**Jdawson**: I'll send what I have.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, send me what you have.
**Gducharme**: It's okay.
**Gducharme**: I can figure it out.
**Gducharme**: Just to make sure they look good for the website.
**Jdawson**: When I was there Wednesday evening, had too many cars in the parking lot.
**Ataylor**: It's fine.
**Gducharme**: Send me some of the good ones that you think are good.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, I think it's good to make a sense.
**Gducharme**: I'm going to go.
**Gducharme**: I'm going to just leave this for a sec.
**Gducharme**: For the moment.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: I'm just going to leave it.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Nick.
**Ataylor**: Goodwill.
**Gducharme**: Bart.
**Fireflies**: I think I'm.
**Fireflies**: I'm done with that project.
**Gducharme**: Okay, so complete, right?
**Jmendez**: I believe so.
**Gducharme**: Confirm the issue with the extraordinary surface control.
**Gducharme**: So.
**Gducharme**: Okay, I'm just going to complete it then.
**Ataylor**: So.
**Gducharme**: Aspire.
**Gducharme**: Nick Richie.
**Ataylor**: Nick.
**Fireflies**: Aspire said they sent out the check.
**Fireflies**: I have the warranty.
**Fireflies**: I just need to send the warranty to Aspire.
**Ataylor**: Okay, sounds good.
**Ataylor**: And then Goodwill Bloomington, this is Nick YouTube.
**Fireflies**: I need to get the owner a change order for the windows, the awnings.
**Fireflies**: I'm waiting on pricing a detail for the awnings and.
**Bclymer**: And the light.
**Fireflies**: I need to work that out.
**Fireflies**: And then I need to hire a certified welder once we confirm a date that we need them on site.
**Fireflies**: Utility, vault.
**Fireflies**: I do need to write that subcontract and also order the water fountain with the bottle filler.
**Ataylor**: Thank you, Nick.
**Ataylor**: Jesse.
**Ataylor**: Alex.
**Gducharme**: Sorry, I keep always forgetting.
**Ataylor**: Seva Consulting Building.
**Ataylor**: Alec.
**Jremillard**: Yep, no problem.
**Jremillard**: I've left multiple messages with the township that's in charge of reviewing the drawings for Cheering Inc.
**Jremillard**: Right now.
**Jremillard**: The anticipated date that we were supposed to get that permit is this Thursday.
**Jremillard**: So I'll keep following up with them in case we get lucky and have it a few days early.
**Jremillard**: I spoke to Brandon this morning and he asked me if we can start the work without the permit.
**Jremillard**: Wasn't really aware that that was an option on the table, but I asked our guy, Rob Ramsey, who's going to be providing the work for us, if they'd be able to do that and he has not responded me just yet.
**Jremillard**: So going to keep following up with the township, try to get in the loop with Rob.
**Jremillard**: Spoke to Mike about it this morning and we'll just see if we can get.
**Jremillard**: Get the ball rolling a little early.
**Ataylor**: Awesome.
**Bclymer**: What is this permit for?
**Jremillard**: Permit on the drawings.
**Jremillard**: They submitted it to the township for approval.
**Bclymer**: I'm sorry, this permit is for the work we completed?
**Jremillard**: No, it's the drawings for the change order adding to the fire suppression system that Sharing Inc. Is going to be subbed from us for.
**Jremillard**: They submitted their drawings for this work to the township and we're going to get the permit on those drawings.
**Bclymer**: Okay, is that a.
**Bclymer**: So this is going to be a change order to them or this is a different client?
**Jremillard**: The way I understand this is a change order.
**Jremillard**: This is an added scope of work and we're using Chair and they were a sub on site I believe, and we're using them for the install area.
**Bclymer**: How much is this scope?
**Bclymer**: The added scope.
**Jremillard**: Let me double check the number here.
**Jremillard**: Just under $16,000.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: This is that small thing we're doing.
**Jremillard**: Oh, actually sorry, that's only.
**Jremillard**: Only about 11.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: Sorry, go ahead.
**Jremillard**: Yep, no problem.
**Gducharme**: Awesome.
**Ataylor**: Thank you, Alec.
**Gducharme**: We have Nick, Goodwill Carp, office Carp cut.

**Awehner**: We got our answers for the perimeter trail from the city on.
**Jdawson**: What what.
**Awehner**: They'Re going to have us leave out.

**Gducharme**: Cormar Exotech.
**Ataylor**: Alec.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: Pull that up real quick.
**Jremillard**: Yes.
**Jremillard**: The only thing that was left here is just to make sure that Seven Hills gets paid.
**Jremillard**: I worked with Keba this afternoon looking back at the purchase order because we had already had it drafted but I need to touch base with accounting.
**Jremillard**: For some reason it's not letting me add a new invoice to their subcontract because there's one drafted the last 10% of their work.
**Jremillard**: So I just need to get in touch with them to make sure I can submit that to Seven Hills.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: There are no comments.
**Bclymer**: Nick Spiers and Lucy aspires says that.
**Fireflies**: The check should be on the way.
**Fireflies**: I do have the warranty document.
**Fireflies**: I just mean to send it to the owner.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: AJ Neiman holding FedEx.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we passed our in wall inspection on Thursday or Friday and hanging jetboard now.
**Jdawson**: And this is Canon calling me right now.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, hanging jetboard now.
**Jdawson**: We're excavating for the entrance footers on Wednesday and moving right along.
**Ataylor**: Awesome.
**Gducharme**: Danville Theater.
**Jdawson**: Yep, I was out there this morning.
**Kmass**: We began scanning the floor.
**Kmass**: We're going to be installing our base and door casing this week with our doors and then tomorrow I'm trying to meet Bill out there at some point so I can go pick up a check for the first invoice.
**Bclymer**: All these things, AJ like buy casework, black plumbing fixtures.
**Ataylor**: Like.
**Bclymer**: Like those long lead things?
**Jdawson**: No, it's all in stock at Lowe's.
**Jdawson**: I just need him to tell me what he wants.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so that's just on my.
**Jdawson**: I can't buy it until he tells me what he wants, so I just keep reminding him.
**Jdawson**: It's more of a reminder for myself.
**Bclymer**: To.
**Jdawson**: Keep pushing him.
**Jdawson**: So hopefully tomorrow I'll just corner him and when I pick up the check, I'll be able to have him make a decision.
**Bclymer**: Do you send him like weekly meet?
**Bclymer**: Like project reports?
**Jdawson**: You don't really check his email?
**Jdawson**: I just send him texts and photos and stuff.
**Jdawson**: He's pretty old guy.
**Bclymer**: Not all of us old octogenarians, like.
**Bclymer**: Don't you xeno, but something.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, he's pretty old school.
**Kmass**: I think.
**Jdawson**: Once we hopefully get the work of the adjacent buildings, which is the whole goal behind this, and do the facade upgrade, when his other investors are involved, I'm thinking those guys are a little more savvy, but we'll see.
**Gducharme**: Thank you, A.J.
**Gducharme**: applying in your office remodel?
**Bclymer**: Yes, apply.
**Kmass**: Okay, so we confirmed the VAV power.
**Kmass**: There's an existing 208 panel that we're going to pull from in the applied space.
**Kmass**: Got that issue figured out.
**Kmass**: I scheduled a partial overhead inspection today.
**Jdawson**: So we can start hanging the hard lid.
**Jdawson**: And then tomorrow, now that Candon's in town, I set up a.
**Jdawson**: Instead of having our owners meeting, which we usually have today on Mondays, we're going to do our owner's meeting tomorrow.
**Kmass**: And walk the space.
**Kmass**: That way they can meet Candon.
**Jdawson**: And we'll.
**Jdawson**: We'll confirm the hard lid access panel location and the mini split location tomorrow.
**Ataylor**: Okay, thank you, aj.
**Gducharme**: Glenn.
**Gducharme**: Sorry, Jesse.
**Gducharme**: Seminole Collective.
**Bclymer**: There's really nothing to update on that job.
**Bclymer**: City is between the city and the owner.
**Ataylor**: Okay, thank you, Jesse.
**Ataylor**: Jesse.
**Gducharme**: Remy.
**Gducharme**: Our poor collective.
**Jmendez**: That's the same update as we had last week.
**Jmendez**: Waiting on the city approvals for the building locations.
**Ataylor**: Thank you, Jesse.

**Ataylor**: Thank you, Nick.
**Gducharme**: Keva Uniqlo University.
**Njepson**: Yes, we have the electrician and the sprinkler installer on site.
**Njepson**: They're currently working on their installations.
**Njepson**: And we have an RFI open for the sprinkler patterns that we are expecting to close out by tomorrow.
**Njepson**: So we can send the latest fabrication drawings to the supplier.
**Njepson**: I have.
**Njepson**: Jesse, we can go over this after the Meeting.
**Njepson**: I have the change order for the transformers drafted.
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: And from last week, we have our.
**Njepson**: We have approval for the sprinklers, the other sprinklers.
**Njepson**: So that's also sent to the supplier for manufacturing or fabrication.
**Njepson**: I think that's it for now.
**Ataylor**: Thank you, Kevin.
**Gducharme**: There are no comments, questions.
**Gducharme**: AJ Matthews, call starts phase two.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, so I sent all the backup.
**Kmass**: To Steve last week.
**Kmass**: I haven't heard anything from him.
**Jdawson**: I know that he's getting married and was on a flight to Greece as of yesterday, so we may not hear from him this week.
**Jdawson**: But ball is in their court.
**Jdawson**: I can't send that bill until I have a PO to bill against.
**Ataylor**: Okay, aj.
**Ataylor**: Thank you, Glenn.
**Ataylor**: Good.
**Gducharme**: Goodwill Foundations.
**Awehner**: Electricians got a small punch list of stuff to fix this week for some defective lights that arrived in the order.
**Awehner**: And our countertop should be going in on Thursday.
**Bclymer**: 20.
**Awehner**: Whatever the 21st is Thursday, I think.
**Awehner**: And then that's it.
**Awehner**: So I'm working on collecting some close out documents and final retainage invoices this week.
**Ataylor**: Okay, thank you.
**Gducharme**: And thank you for the photos.
**Gducharme**: They were really great for social media now.
**Gducharme**: Cor, aj.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Kmass**: So final grade seed and straw set up to start tomorrow.
**Kmass**: Maybe done tomorrow, May leak into Wednesday.
**Kmass**: And then they added a railing that we got approved for, so that installs on Thursday.
**Kmass**: That job will be wrapped up.
**Gducharme**: Nice, Keva.
**Gducharme**: Raider, Martinsville.
**Njepson**: There's nothing happening on this one yet.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, so I met with JP's back in town from Europe.
**Kmass**: I spoke with him.
**Kmass**: They're gonna be.
**Jdawson**: I kind of warned him, Kevin.
**Jdawson**: I was like, I know how it's gonna be, jp.
**Jdawson**: You guys are sitting on this, and then three weeks from now, you're gonna ask us to start in a week.
**Jdawson**: So I was like, I need a release because there's some design involved.
**Jdawson**: So that's.
**Jdawson**: That's on the Amex move portion.
**Jdawson**: So I'm gonna.
**Jdawson**: Actually, I guess we can just keep this all under radial Martin.
**Jdawson**: So there's a couple different jobs we're pricing because this is.
**Jdawson**: This one is separate from God below, correct?
**Ataylor**: Yeah, but we'll.
**Jdawson**: We'll hopefully know more here in the next couple weeks.
**Ataylor**: Thank you, aj.
**Ataylor**: Thank you, Kevin.
**Ataylor**: Radial Avon.
**Ataylor**: Keva.
**Njepson**: I spoke with Tony about getting us or getting closeout documents ready.
**Njepson**: And I also sent an email to Brennan for them to get theirs as well.
**Njepson**: So I'll keep following up as we get closer.
**Kmass**: Perfect.
**Njepson**: We can get that ready.
**Jdawson**: Well, leveler install is complete.
**Kmass**: We're just waiting on delivery of two added doc restraints.
**Kmass**: I Don't have a date on those yet.
**Kmass**: JP's back in town, so tomorrow I'm gonna walk with him at 10am and then I'll create a punch list.
**Kmass**: But it's looking like we're running out of work.
**Jdawson**: We're probably gonna be wrapped up here.
**Jdawson**: I mean, end of next week.
**Jdawson**: Depends on if they choose to install the Baylor or not.
**Ataylor**: Okay, thank you.
**Ataylor**: Aj Aspire, Kissimmee.
**Ataylor**: Nick.
**Fireflies**: Aspire said they're going to send the payment and I need to get the warranty document from the subcontractor.
**Ataylor**: Okay, thank you, Nick.
**Gducharme**: Radio Brownsburg A.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we finished the guardrail last week that was added on after the fact.
**Kmass**: I sent in the the first final bill.
**Kmass**: Now I have to send another bill in once I have a PO to bill against for the added guardrail.
**Kmass**: Deb was working on getting the closeout docs, the warranty letters together.
**Njepson**: Yeah, do we.
**Njepson**: Do we need one for the guardrail installation too?
**Kmass**: I mean it's always good to have them just to.
**Jdawson**: If a bolt comes loose or something.
**Njepson**: Okay, I'll talk to Christian about that.
**Jdawson**: We typically don't.
**Jdawson**: I mean, Radial won't ask for any closeout documents, Kevin, but that way we have them.
**Jdawson**: And in case something ever happens, we have it for our subs to send them out there.
**Njepson**: Gotcha.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Okay, thank you guys.
**Gducharme**: GPC Harrisburg alec.
**Jremillard**: Yep.
**Jremillard**: So after a long, strenuous week of trying to figure out who the fire marshal is in this area that covers the address of this project, I finally got the contact info and was finally able to get a hold of them today.
**Jremillard**: And I have an application on their building and zone.
**Jremillard**: Building and zoning permitting.
**Jremillard**: So I gotta start filling that out and submit what was.
**Jremillard**: What else we.
**Jremillard**: We also have material and manpower quotes from Adelphia and Accufire.
**Jremillard**: So tomorrow morning I was going to take a look at that with Jesse R. And a few notes from Accufire making sure that the material that they're providing is kosher.
**Jremillard**: Pretty much the same as what we have on Uniqlo.
**Jremillard**: But yeah, it's planning to review that tomorrow morning.
**Ataylor**: Thank you, Alec.
**Gducharme**: This is ajf Nick, the Robin Homes.
**Fireflies**: The subcontractor should complete the demo this week and I need to schedule Duke to come out and energize the temp hour.
**Fireflies**: Also do the final billing.
**Ataylor**: Thank you so much.
**Gducharme**: I don't know what is this internal team project means for new project template?
**Ataylor**: Is this somebody try to create something?
**Ataylor**: No.
**Gducharme**: If not, I'll just get rid of these ones.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: Because we don't need it.
**Gducharme**: Okay, so that's done for projects.
**Gducharme**: Estimating so.
**Gducharme**: AJ Stungate Orthodontist.
**Kmass**: No update there.
**Kmass**: I'll try and call Ron this week.
**Ataylor**: Okay, thank you.
**Gducharme**: This is Brandon or Jesse perhaps.
**Gducharme**: Mix Use Ky.
**Bclymer**: I don't really have an update on that.
**Bclymer**: I know he's waiting on them to approve I think a layout he recently sent.
**Ataylor**: Okay, thank you.
**Ataylor**: Jesse, this is you.
**Gducharme**: Paradise Aisle.
**Bclymer**: They were just waiting on the financing.
**Ataylor**: To get approved on the approval.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: Thank you, Jesse.
**Gducharme**: Nick Novelsville Excel Center.
**Ataylor**: We.
**Fireflies**: We sent Goodwill and updated it for a plan.
**Fireflies**: And now this week, hopefully we can meet with them to review it.
**Ataylor**: Sounds good.
**Gducharme**: Ulta Beauty, Fresno.
**Ataylor**: A.J.
**Kmass**: I think we're at a good spot on this.
**Kmass**: Camden and Jesse are been working too on it and we're really kind of just dragging our feet until we could get that California license.
**Kmass**: Because if we badger Walter now and he says go, we don't have a license to use yet.
**Kmass**: So we're at a good spot with pricing where if we were to pull the trigger, we'd be ready to rock and roll.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jmendez**: There's a week lead time on structural drawings and a 20 week lead time on the units.
**Jmendez**: So there's a good window to get everything planned out correctly.
**Kmass**: 20 weeks on the units.
**Kmass**: I keep forgetting that these are big units.
**Bclymer**: Maria is California.
**Bclymer**: They'll get back to you, I guess.
**Bclymer**: Or should we be looking for something, me or Brandon?
**Kmass**: No, they have to be for mail here.
**Gducharme**: No, it has to be an email to you, Jesse, or to Brandon.
**Gducharme**: But I haven't received anything from your.
**Gducharme**: From Brandon's email.
**Gducharme**: I don't know if from yours.
**Gducharme**: We can try to check if Ashley maybe find something, but I don't.
**Gducharme**: I don't think so.
**Gducharme**: Usually it's to Brandon's or to you, but nothing on the mail.
**Gducharme**: Just an email saying that actually they received the application and that we can actually access already their.
**Gducharme**: Their platform, you know, to check the progress and everything.
**Gducharme**: If not, I can call tomorrow or I can ask you, Ashley, maybe to call tomorrow so we can make sure that they receive it and they can.
**Gducharme**: They can follow up with that.
**Gducharme**: Okay, I can definitely call tomorrow.
**Gducharme**: I haven't seen anything in Jesse's inbox from last week or today, but I'll.
**Ataylor**: Keep an eye on that.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Gducharme**: If anything, I'll call you tomorrow so we can.
**Gducharme**: I can show you how to do it and how to.
**Gducharme**: I mean, who to call so, you know, so we can make sure they receive it.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Okay, Perfect.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: Let'S move forward.
**Gducharme**: Tampa office building.
**Gducharme**: This is Jesse.
**Bclymer**: No update on that one.
**Gducharme**: Okay, Nick, Goodwill storefront modifications.
**Fireflies**: Yeah, Goodwill is going to send us when their school has break and then we'll schedule the subcontractors.
**Kmass**: So is this a job now?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Kmass**: Maria, can you move this to the current projects?
**Gducharme**: So wait, so Nick, do you want me to move it as a job right now?
**Fireflies**: Yeah, it's a current job.
**Gducharme**: Okay, so what's the number of the current job?
**Kmass**: It would be next in line, correct?
**Kmass**: After the road.
**Gducharme**: The next one?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Kmass**: 25, 122.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Okay, it's a job now.
**Bclymer**: Nick, have you created a.
**Bclymer**: Have you moved that over into current projects?
**Fireflies**: No, I don't think so.
**Bclymer**: I would do that before someone else throws a folder in there and doubles up the numbers.
**Kmass**: Jesse, how do you want us doing that?
**Kmass**: Do you just want us copying the whole?
**Kmass**: When we move a project from estimating to 20, 25 jobs or whatever the job folder is, we're just going to change the name of the folder, correct?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, you cut and paste it into the current projects.
**Bclymer**: So there's not two copies of it, Right?
**Bclymer**: I think it's making duplicates.
**Bclymer**: If anyone's logged into it, that just keeps a copy there.
**Bclymer**: So you might just notify everybody.
**Bclymer**: Hey, everybody, if you're in this folder, which I don't know why anyone would be, so if you do it early and no one's in there, you know, looking at anything or has any open files, then it'll move it clean and it doesn't create that copy.
**Bclymer**: Like it happens a lot.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that makes sense.
**Gducharme**: Okay, don't forget to move that then.
**Gducharme**: Nick, bio lab expansion.
**Ataylor**: This is Jesse and Nick.
**Bclymer**: That job is lost.
**Bclymer**: Get rid of it.
**Ataylor**: Okay, so lost.
**Ataylor**: Thank you, guys.
**Gducharme**: Now we have vermion rights.
**Gducharme**: Building edition, AJ Yeah, so they.
**Kmass**: Change it to a hundred thousand square foot building and we'll be competing against another GC, maybe another two other GCs.
**Kmass**: So once we get those plans.
**Jdawson**: Alec.
**Kmass**: And I'll start hitting it hard to get coverage and start pricing it up.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, aj, Just to keep you in the loop, I've been working on those drawings a bit today.
**Jremillard**: We can schedule a call tomorrow or this week if you want to.
**Jremillard**: So I can show you what I've got so far, but I just kind of removed the gap in between them and put a firewall in between the two buildings.
**Jremillard**: So it's one 100,000 square foot building.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Kmass**: We don't even have a location yet, do we, Jesse Dawson?
**Bclymer**: We don't.
**Bclymer**: I asked.
**Bclymer**: They said it's in the same.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Business.
**Bclymer**: So it's.
**Jremillard**: I, I looked, I looked around that area today online a bit.
**Jremillard**: There wasn't much for sale land wise on any that was in that same area.
**Jremillard**: But there is plenty of land still.
**Jremillard**: It might just not be posted that I can find anywhere but, but yeah, there's like a two or three country road block area that's full of, it's like an industrial corner of that town.
**Jremillard**: So.
**Jremillard**: Well, I'd imagine still be in the same area.
**Kmass**: It's western Indiana.
**Kmass**: There's like nothing out there anyway.
**Kmass**: So I'm sure there's gotta be so much land available.
**Jremillard**: Hey, those are really good people out there with a lot of character, you know.
**Kmass**: Hey, I have no problem with them.
**Kmass**: I'm just saying it's the middle of freaking nowhere.
**Gducharme**: Okay, moving forward.
**Gducharme**: 440 Wesnor Building.
**Gducharme**: I like Jesse.
**Jremillard**: I'm not aware of any kind of updates.
**Jremillard**: Jesse, do you have anything from Tim?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, there's no, you know, he's got, he's got our pricing again.
**Bclymer**: Just waiting on, waiting on a notice of approval or they want to proceed with it.
**Ataylor**: Okay, thank you guys.
**Gducharme**: Keva Radio diver.
**Kmass**: Yeah, so Kevin, I spoke with JP today.
**Kmass**: I basically put pressure on him.
**Kmass**: I said you guys are wanting to do this in January, we have to get design drawings for this.
**Kmass**: So he's going to put pressure on the two local contractors he looked out to and he's going to tell radio that if he doesn't get an answer by the end of this week then the job is probably going to be ours, which is awesome.
**Kmass**: However, we do owe him pricing for that curtain.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Are you tracking on that at all?
**Jremillard**: You're on mute, Kevin.
**Njepson**: Sorry.
**Njepson**: Yeah, I just sent an email following up on that so we can get the shipping pricing included before we send it to jp.
**Kmass**: Well, yeah, well just make sure you call them tomorrow.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Kmass**: Try and badger him for it because he's been asking for a couple weeks, which I told him we kind of put it on the back burner, focus on the these other jobs.
**Kmass**: And he said it's fine but we, let's just get it off our plate and then we can hopefully get released.
**Njepson**: Did you give him any pricing yet or.
**Kmass**: No, I just told him I, you know, I owe him a.
**Kmass**: It's going to cost a little less.
**Kmass**: Right?
**Kmass**: But I said it's almost going to.
**Jdawson**: Be a wash and we don't recommend doing that, so.
**Njepson**: Gotcha.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Kmass**: But other than that, he mentioned when you were on site walking with his engineer, did they mention anything to you.
**Jdawson**: About us pricing, racking and conveyor move?
**Kmass**: I know we have the electrical included.
**Njepson**: No, I mean they did mention it, but the security guy was saying they are going to move it.
**Njepson**: He didn't ask us to price that.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Kmass**: Yeah, because we use.
**Kmass**: Typically they bring in their own integrator to do that stuff.
**Kmass**: So I told him we can price.
**Jdawson**: It, but we're not tracking on it at all.
**Kmass**: So you said someone from security told you.
**Njepson**: Yeah, it's the head.
**Njepson**: The head of security that I worked with.
**Kmass**: Interesting.
**Kmass**: Okay, well, I'll let JP Know tomorrow that when I walk with him.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Thank you, guys.

**Bclymer**: They got to negotiate their leases and based on our proposal and see if they make sense and then we can move forward.
**Jdawson**: Jesse, where's that Allison Road one at.
**Kmass**: In relation to our office?
**Bclymer**: It should have been Allisonville.
**Bclymer**: I labeled it wrong.
**Bclymer**: That's my fault.
**Bclymer**: But it's.
**Bclymer**: I don't.
**Bclymer**: Five, ten minutes.
**Bclymer**: You just hit Allisonville Road, make a left from the office and it's two miles, I think.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I know where that one is.
**Kmass**: Nice.
**Bclymer**: Used to be a big lots.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I know exactly where that is.
**Jdawson**: Cool.
**Bclymer**: It'll be one of two Goodwill stores that doesn't have the blue paint.
