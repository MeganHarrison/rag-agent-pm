## Transcript
**Erikaf**: Jimmy, are.
**Erikaf**: Are you with Erica?
**Erikaf**: You guys are both together or.
**Erikaf**: I mean, does that mean you work with her?
**Jannifer**: Yeah, he's the superintendent.
**Jannifer**: She's.
**Jannifer**: She's in the lobby.
**Jannifer**: I think she's trying to get on.
**Jannifer**: On the Zoom right now as well.
**Erikaf**: Okay.
**Erikaf**: Nothing.
**Erikaf**: Doesn't show anybody in the lobby yet, but yeah, there it is.
**Jdawson**: No, it's actually all.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Hello?
**Jdawson**: Can you guys hear me?
**Erikaf**: Yep, we can hear you.
**Jdawson**: No, I can't.
**Erikaf**: Just go up and click your little drop down next to your mic and you can change your speaker.
**Jdawson**: Okay, can you guys hear me now?
**Erikaf**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: Perfect.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Jimmy, are you on there?
**Jannifer**: Yep, I'm here.
**Jdawson**: Okay, Brandon, Jimmy is on here.
**Jdawson**: He's a new field manager running the job, so I'm having him on here.
**Jdawson**: So since our last conversation, I reached out to a couple of contractors that we work with.
**Jdawson**: They are swamped.
**Jdawson**: They are not able to get to work.
**Jdawson**: Get to this work.
**Jdawson**: What is the start of when you're needing the H Vac in there?
**Erikaf**: Schedule.
**Jannifer**: It.
**Erikaf**: See here?
**Erikaf**: So we had roof curves getting set on 825, which.
**Erikaf**: Those are already done by our installer.
**Erikaf**: So theoretically that's, you know, you could set units anytime after that.
**Erikaf**: The actual rough in we have is end of September is when H Vac rough in starts.
**Erikaf**: So we've got.
**Erikaf**: Yeah, I mean, yeah, some of this like RCU screens and stuff is.
**Erikaf**: Is sooner, but that can push the.
**Erikaf**: Really, the biggest thing obviously is, you know, whenever you have to have those units set, you know, before you start roughing in.
**Erikaf**: And I don't.
**Erikaf**: I doubt you want to go backwards.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: No, I agree.
**Erikaf**: They'll also.
**Bclymer**: They'll have some penetrations through that concrete deck that's going to get poured before then.
**Bclymer**: Need to make sure you coordinate those are size, right?
**Erikaf**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And when is that getting poured?
**Jdawson**: Do you have a date on that yet?
**Erikaf**: So looks like early September is when it'll pour for the.
**Erikaf**: You're talking about for the mezzanine, right, Jesse?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Early September.
**Erikaf**: Yeah, basically about a month from now.
**Jdawson**: Okay, Jimmy, do you want to jump on or do you want me to keep rolling?
**Jdawson**: I didn't want to.
**Jannifer**: No, that's fine.
**Jannifer**: So if we, if we chose not to do this, this job after the design and if everything.
**Jannifer**: Do you guys already have been in contact with another H VAC company?
**Erikaf**: Yeah, yeah, we went over that with Erica last, you know, last, I guess two weeks ago or whatever.
**Erikaf**: So, yeah, we've got other, other quotes.
**Erikaf**: You know, we've got, you Know, our lowest quote, he can meet the schedule and he's on, on board to do it.
**Erikaf**: However, there's a gap of basically $74,000 between his price and Erica's price.
**Jannifer**: Yeah.
**Jannifer**: And that's not counting the design or anything like that, right?
**Erikaf**: No, that doesn't, that does take the design into account.
**Erikaf**: That's a total difference.
**Erikaf**: So if we took the design out, it's just roughly, you know, 50 and some change.
**Erikaf**: It's basically the cost of the units.
**Jannifer**: Okay.
**Erikaf**: All right.
**Erikaf**: Yeah.
**Jannifer**: Because we had some setbacks in the H vac and we've kind of tried to gear back up to handle some stuff.
**Jannifer**: We're just super busy with it.
**Jannifer**: So I mean, we'd like to not do it just because of our schedule, but that would just mean we just have to hire some more guys and make it work just like everything else.
**Jannifer**: How many bids did you guys get when we were bidding it originally?
**Erikaf**: Originally we had.
**Erikaf**: Well, I mean, I don't know because they're all in one big folder now.
**Erikaf**: I mean, we, I think we have eight total bids.
**Jannifer**: Yeah.
**Jannifer**: And we were, and we were basically 75 grand below all the rest early on.
**Erikaf**: Yeah, something like that.
**Erikaf**: Yeah, I think it was, I think it was, yeah, 75 or 65.
**Erikaf**: I, we had some, we had a change order, we added some stuff.
**Erikaf**: So I, I couldn't go back and tell you the exact amount, but.
**Erikaf**: Yes, I mean, say something around there because I think we added the design in there, so I think it was probably closer to the 50 to 60 range.
**Jannifer**: Yeah, I just wish somebody would have, which, I mean, it's ultimately our fault for giving a bid that underpriced because we had some guys that kind of missed some things and we left some things out of the bid.
**Erikaf**: So I mean, if you're alluding to you wish that we would have said something.
**Erikaf**: I mean, your proposal called everything out and it was reviewed, you know, with your guys estimator.
**Erikaf**: So as far as us saying, like, well, are you sure you don't want to put more money on it?
**Erikaf**: I know you got everything, but you sure you don't want to add some?
**Erikaf**: That's not exactly the business I'm in.
**Jannifer**: Yeah, no, I understand that.
**Jannifer**: Well, when do you need an exact yes or no if we're going to do it versus trying to help you guys out and eat the 50 or 60 grand?
**Jannifer**: That's different.
**Erikaf**: I mean, we're, like I said, we're a month out from when somebody has to get on site.
**Erikaf**: So think about if the roles are reversed and you were going to come in and replace somebody, how much of a notification would you need to get on site and do the work?
**Jannifer**: Yeah, yeah, I was just kind of wondering if the people that you got were basically tentatively ready if you say go or.
**Erikaf**: I mean, they have other jobs and they have a business now again, you know, like cns, which I sent you.
**Erikaf**: I think we went over the estimate last week with Erica.
**Erikaf**: And so.
**Erikaf**: Yeah, I mean, CNS is who, you know, is the low person that the doist.
**Erikaf**: We use them on other jobs.
**Erikaf**: But I'm not, you know, I'm not telling him to.
**Erikaf**: Oh, well, you gotta just hold off and then wait and see what they do.
**Erikaf**: I mean, really, by the end of this week, we have to make a decision.
**Erikaf**: Either, you know, you guys say you're gonna do it, pay the difference, or I put you on notice.
**Erikaf**: But I mean, we can't just keep waiting.
**Erikaf**: We're gonna screw ourselves.
**Jannifer**: No, I totally agree.
**Jannifer**: And I think we'll get you an answer either by the end of today or tomorrow.
**Jannifer**: We'll kind of go over stuff because we were overwhelmed at first, you know, the.
**Jannifer**: When you guys first talked.
**Jannifer**: And we've been going over it and doing some hiring and kind of studying the print.
**Jannifer**: So I mean, it's something that we can handle.
**Jannifer**: Is just going to put us at a pinch and we didn't want to have to roll that tight schedule and just building a bad relationship with you guys right off the get go, you know what I mean?
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Jannifer**: So what is, what is your cell phone number so I can call you direct?
**Jannifer**: Is that possible?
**Erikaf**: Yeah, it's a.
**Erikaf**: It's in my signature, but it's 31 7.
**Jannifer**: My bad, man.
**Erikaf**: That's okay.
**Erikaf**: It's 317-760-0088.
**Erikaf**: And Jesse is our COO, so he can make all the same decisions, you know, so if you want to.
**Erikaf**: Jesse, if you want to give him your information, because that might probably be a better way to start.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: My number is 502-612-2089.
**Jannifer**: All right.
**Erikaf**: And if you're wanting to talk about, you know, how to, how to do this, Jesse's probably going to be a better spot.
**Erikaf**: You know, he's more involved with the job than.
**Erikaf**: Than I am.
**Erikaf**: I can read a schedule and tell you what it says.
**Erikaf**: But as far as day to day, what can slip this stuff, I. I would not be the guy.
**Jannifer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Back in the day, I did H Vac so I could come and actually install the job for you.
**Bclymer**: I Just don't have the time.
**Erikaf**: So.
**Erikaf**: Yeah, he'll pay in the sheet metal all day.
**Jannifer**: That's what I'm talking about.
**Jannifer**: You need a job.
**Bclymer**: No.
**Erikaf**: Don't you try it.
**Jannifer**: No, that's cool.
**Jannifer**: I appreciate you guys being cool.
**Jannifer**: I was kind of ready for a kind of like a type of a meeting.
**Jannifer**: But you guys seem cool, and we'll work with you and we'll get it figured out, man.
**Erikaf**: Well, it's all up front.
**Erikaf**: We're actually jerks.
**Jdawson**: We can see the little dog in the background, though, so, you know, you can't be that hard.
**Erikaf**: It's a stuffed animal.
**Erikaf**: It's for looks.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, that's a cat.
**Erikaf**: She's lazy.
**Jdawson**: She's a little dog lover.
**Jdawson**: So she noticed that right off the bat, she's like, oh, my gosh, he's got a little dog.
**Erikaf**: No, I mean, Jimmy, to answer your question.
**Erikaf**: I mean, again, as I.
**Erikaf**: As I told Erica when we met, like, I get it, like, you know, whatever happened, you know, with, you know, bad apples, like, it's business that happens.
**Erikaf**: You know, we've all had our stuff.
**Erikaf**: You know, Lord knows I've had employees that are no longer with us, that have screwed up, and it's cost me well over half a million dollars.
**Erikaf**: But at the end of the day, like, you know, I'm a man, my word.
**Erikaf**: And when I say I'm gonna do something, I'm gonna do it, you know?
**Erikaf**: And so, yeah, I mean, there's no reason to arguing.
**Erikaf**: I mean, it's just.
**Erikaf**: It is what it is.
**Erikaf**: Here's where we're at, and we'll find a way forward.
**Erikaf**: One.
**Erikaf**: One way or another.
**Jannifer**: Yeah.
**Jannifer**: And, you know, I was gonna ask this too, because, I mean, if we build a relationship and we're cool and, you know, we squeeze you guys in, you get in a pinch.
**Jannifer**: We get in a pinch, you know, is there any way to work on this price?
**Jannifer**: You know what I mean?
**Jannifer**: Is there any fluff that you guys had it in or you.
**Jannifer**: You locked in or.
**Jannifer**: Or can.
**Jannifer**: Can we do something with that?
**Jannifer**: And it just kind of make it.
**Erikaf**: Easy for everybody, you know, as I.
**Erikaf**: As I told Erica, I mean, obviously we're locked in.
**Erikaf**: There's no there.
**Erikaf**: There's no world where I go back to the owner and say, hey, give me an extra 50 grand, because we, you know, up.
**Erikaf**: That's not gonna happen now, as far as, like, you know, working with you guys, because, you know, it's like, hey, man, I like, here's how what I'm losing, like, what can you do for me something like that?
**Erikaf**: Then, you know, we can look at it.
**Erikaf**: I can't make any promises right now.
**Erikaf**: I mean, like, I just.
**Erikaf**: You guys got to put something in front of me, right?
**Erikaf**: Like, I can't sit here and work off speculation.
**Erikaf**: I think the fact that we're having this conversations instead of us putting you on notice and, you know, just letting the attorneys handle it says a lot about how we work with people.
**Erikaf**: But I'm not going to sit here and commit and say, oh, yeah, well, just, I'll just eat 50 grand of it.
**Erikaf**: Like, that's not going to work.
**Jannifer**: Yeah.
**Jannifer**: Now, who do you guys use for all your plumbing?
**Erikaf**: All of our plumbing.
**Erikaf**: I, I don't know if that would be a word to, to say.
**Erikaf**: We, we have an office in Indian office in Tampa.
**Erikaf**: We, I think we're active in like 20 states.
**Erikaf**: So, you know, locally, I know we've used McCurdy.
**Erikaf**: I've seen them.
**Erikaf**: I've seen Mission Mechanical.
**Erikaf**: I think it's.
**Erikaf**: Is Justin Dorsey on this one, Jesse?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Erikaf**: Yeah.
**Erikaf**: I don't know who's on the other ones.
**Erikaf**: I mean, I, I, we spread the love, you know, I know that I couldn't give you a list of everybody we use, but I, I just, I just signed, you know, 50 some odd checks yesterday and I just remember seeing some of those guys.
**Jannifer**: Cool.
**Jannifer**: Well, I mean, that, that would help too, if we could try to get some of your guys work.
**Erikaf**: Yeah, I mean, we got, you know, I mean, obviously everything's spoken for in this job.
**Erikaf**: That's it.
**Erikaf**: I mean, you know, again, I'm not going to sit here and, and trade ponies with you and say, oh, well, we'll get you on this one.
**Erikaf**: That's the kind of stuff I do with, you know, people that we've worked on several projects with.
**Erikaf**: This is our first experience.
**Erikaf**: You've yet to actually put anything in, you know, so I can tell you that, like, we use a lot of the same people several times because we do a lot of design build like this.
**Erikaf**: It's our primary driver.
**Erikaf**: I mean, I know deem electrical.
**Erikaf**: We use them a ton.
**Erikaf**: I've seen McCurdy on quite a bit of our stuff, especially when it comes to, we do a lot of different, like charter school stuff.
**Erikaf**: So, yeah, I mean, you know, we're always looking for, for different people.
**Erikaf**: But again, like, part of it is like, let's, let's see what we do.
**Erikaf**: Let's perform before I sit here and make a promise.
**Erikaf**: So if you guys come back in and you know, you redeem yourselves and, you know, pull it off and you, you know, keep your promise, then that's definitely a winning trait.
**Erikaf**: But, you know, if you guys say we're going to do it and then you drop the ball, like, you know, I'm not gonna give you more work.
**Jannifer**: Yeah, yeah, I definitely won't.
**Jannifer**: I won't let that happen, no matter what it is.
**Jannifer**: So we're gonna hit it hard.
**Jannifer**: I'll talk with Erica and we'll get it figured out today, get you guys an answer, and then get a schedule and start knocking it out and try to win you guys over.
**Bclymer**: One thing that two schedule wise coming up.
**Bclymer**: Like, I know these RTUs are either here or in route, but we're starting pavement of the site this week.
**Bclymer**: So, like, if those deliveries are happening too, that's something we need to coordinate with what's going on there.
**Jannifer**: Yeah, we've got the RT shop right now.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Can.
**Jdawson**: I'll go ahead and email both of you guys, Jimmy and his assistant Jackson, email addresses and then if you guys can, email schedules and when you guys are having job site meetings.
**Jdawson**: Site meetings, zoom calls, whatever.
**Jdawson**: If you guys can add both of them in there on that, that would be great.
**Jdawson**: And we can just get some things going.
**Erikaf**: Yeah, we'll get back into the project team and that way they get on the pre con and all the scheduling meetings with the team.
**Jdawson**: Okay, perfect.
**Erikaf**: Cool.
**Erikaf**: So just so we can make sure we're on the same page, I heard two things.
**Erikaf**: Like, one, you just said add those guys to the meetings.
**Erikaf**: But before it sounded like Jimmy was saying, we'll let you know by today or tomorrow if we're going to be able to do the work or not.
**Erikaf**: So where would we be?
**Erikaf**: Oh, hey, we're committed.
**Erikaf**: We're gonna be able to do this.
**Erikaf**: Or let us talk internally and get back to you.
**Jannifer**: We'll talk internally and get back with you either today or tomorrow.
**Jannifer**: And then we can set up those emails, get a schedule hammered out, see when we're gonna set these RTUs, and that way we're not messing with your, with your site work and start hammering out a schedule.
**Jdawson**: All right, so we'll, we'll reach out tomorrow.
**Erikaf**: When I say when I hear today or tomorrow, what I'm.
**Erikaf**: What I understand that to be is that before noon tomorrow I'll have an answer.
**Erikaf**: Is that accurate?
**Jdawson**: Yes, you will.
**Jdawson**: Sorry, I jumped the gun a little bit.
**Jdawson**: I was kind of reading off his words.
**Jdawson**: But yes, I will go ahead and make sure that we are in contact first.
**Jdawson**: Thing in the morning.
**Erikaf**: Okay.
**Erikaf**: Appreciate it.
**Erikaf**: Anything else for us?
**Jdawson**: No, I think that's it.
**Erikaf**: Thank you, guys.
**Erikaf**: Appreciate it.
**Jdawson**: Have a good one.
**Jannifer**: Thank you.
**Bclymer**: Bye.
