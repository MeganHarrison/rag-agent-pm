**Jcurtin**: Sa.
**Jdawson**: Good morning, Jack.
**Ksipe**: Hey, morning, Nick.
**Jdawson**: How's it going today?
**Ksipe**: Going good, Going good.
**Ksipe**: Griffin and them are pushing away on the parapet wall.
**Ksipe**: Dean finished up the cash wraps yesterday, so they're now going to move back into the receiving area and start on those data drops and all the conduit for that and all the MC cable for the receptacles.
**Jcurtin**: We did get a little bit of.
**Ksipe**: Rain last night, so there's a little bit of.
**Ksipe**: It's kind of moist back there.
**Ksipe**: So we'll see, we'll see how McGray & Sons reacts to that.
**Jdawson**: Is, is it.
**Jdawson**: Are you able to pump, pump it out?
**Ksipe**: Yeah, yesterday I pumped out all of it.
**Ksipe**: The little bit left, I could pump some more too.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, Yeah, I would just do everything you can to have it ready for the.
**Ksipe**: Will do.
**Ksipe**: Will do.
**Jdawson**: The, the layout of the wall.
**Jdawson**: Do you have any more questions on that?
**Jdawson**: The layout of the footing?
**Ksipe**: No.
**Ksipe**: The top of the footing has to be 5.
**Ksipe**: The top of the footing to the top of the slab supposed to be a 5 foot 6 difference.
**Ksipe**: The only thing is rock solid is going to end up cutting one of their 10 inch bricks into a 2 inch or one of their 10 inch blocks into a 2 inch so that they get that 5, 6, 5, 4 would be all four full courses of block.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I just don't want to change it this, this way.
**Ksipe**: Yeah, no, I mean, I agree.
**Jdawson**: So yeah, I understand what he's saying.
**Ksipe**: Yeah, I think I'm going to tell him just get that 2 inch, you know, if, get the, get the 2 inch block out the way first if they want to lay that first or if they want to, you know, however they want to do it.
**Ksipe**: But it has to be 5, 6.
**Ksipe**: And then he may be like, but that's done.
**Ksipe**: I'm like, look, just.
**Jdawson**: He should have sent in RFI earlier.
**Ksipe**: Yeah, exactly.
**Ksipe**: Yeah.
**Ksipe**: I do have a question.
**Jcurtin**: All right.
**Ksipe**: Okay.
**Ksipe**: So I just went back to teams to see you're sharing your screen.
**Ksipe**: Can you, can you go back to the drawings so that we're on the same page too?
**Ksipe**: There's going to be no SC fab regarding the lentils and beam and everything.
**Ksipe**: It's going to be rock solid.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, gotcha.
**Ksipe**: And then I'm going to have Glen Mark weld it.
**Ksipe**: Hey, Jesse.
**Jcurtin**: Morning, Jack.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, have you talked to McCrae yet this morning?
**Ksipe**: Heather did not answer my call but.
**Jcurtin**: She did text me.
**Jcurtin**: She said.
**Ksipe**: Not.
**Ksipe**: I said yesterday, I said, what time do you plan on mobilizing tomorrow?
**Ksipe**: She texted me this morning and said not sure on time.
**Jcurtin**: What time?
**Ksipe**: They're mobilizing.
**Ksipe**: I was trying to get it an exact time so that I can have Rock Solid.
**Ksipe**: I can have David from Rock Solid come out here at the same time.
**Ksipe**: So we go over the Dow locations like we talked about yesterday.
**Jdawson**: Then the.
**Jdawson**: The drains at the canopy.
**Jdawson**: I. I think Griffin and.
**Jdawson**: Griffin and the roofer, we're gonna talk in the afternoon.
**Jdawson**: Did you hear anything about that?
**Ksipe**: Griffin hasn't mentioned anything to me specific on that this morning, but I'll touch base with him and let him know I'll pop in on.
**Ksipe**: On being in the loop with that.
**Ksipe**: With those conversations.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: No, Jesse, because there's going to be the donation sign at the canopy.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I've looked at photos of other Goodwill canopies, and they have it just on the front of the canopy.
**Jdawson**: So we decided we're not going to put a gutter along the front.
**Jdawson**: We're just going to put downspouts that run down the omelets.
**Jdawson**: And the framer, he.
**Jdawson**: He's going to frame a scupper opening.
**Jdawson**: And the roofer, he has the gutters in his.
**Jdawson**: In his contract, and he said he's fine with doing the downspouts.
**Jcurtin**: So you're going to put a collector head and then a downspout down the outside?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, it's gonna.
**Jdawson**: It's gonna.
**Jdawson**: So the scrubber is gonna be on the east side.
**Jdawson**: There's gonna be two of them at.
**Jdawson**: There's one.
**Jdawson**: One at each column.
**Jdawson**: And it's going to come down and then, like, 45 to the column and then come down the column.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: And is there overflow?
**Jcurtin**: Where's the overflow drain?
**Jdawson**: Do you think we.
**Jdawson**: We need an overflow scupper?
**Jcurtin**: Well, most buildings do.
**Jcurtin**: Like, if the.
**Jcurtin**: If the downspouts get clogged up, then the roof is just going to flood.
**Jcurtin**: So, like, the roofer should know that.
**Jcurtin**: Like, I thought we had them drawn over.
**Jdawson**: No, we never had them drawn.
**Jcurtin**: Do you think of a roof you always have the primary drain and the overflow drain that are sitting next to each other?
**Jdawson**: Or we put overflows, like, right here.
**Jdawson**: Or overflows where the primary is.
**Jcurtin**: It doesn't matter where they are.
**Jcurtin**: You just have an equal amount of drainage.
**Jcurtin**: If the drains get stopped up, it doesn't fill up the whole roof.
**Jcurtin**: So they could be on the opposite side from the two.
**Jcurtin**: Like, what is.
**Jcurtin**: Are they going to just taper in insulation so it all flows to one side?
**Jdawson**: Well, it's going to.
**Jdawson**: There's going to be one drain on one column, and One on the other.
**Jdawson**: And he's going to slope it that way, that it's structurally sloped this way.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: So then you'll put a cricket in this side and get it to the corner.
**Jcurtin**: So then, yeah, wherever that low spot.
**Jdawson**: Is, just put a overflow on top up there.
**Jcurtin**: You could put them like.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, come off the right side, one on each end with just an overflow scupper.
**Jcurtin**: And I think, I don't know, it's just a couple inches higher than the roof drain.
**Jcurtin**: Okay, that's.
**Jcurtin**: There's an overflow scupper right there.
**Ksipe**: Something like that.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jdawson**: It's going to be higher up, though.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: Because water should never come out of that unless the roof backs up or the drain backs up.
**Jcurtin**: Gotcha.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so I guess we, we can maybe set up a call for 11 o' clock with Griffin so we, we can go over.
**Jdawson**: That sounds good.
**Jdawson**: His studs should be spaced.
**Jdawson**: We.
**Jdawson**: We already have the scuppers in that location, so the steps should be spaced properly.
**Jdawson**: He'll just have to put something like below and above where the scupper is.
**Jcurtin**: All right.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And utility ball.
**Jdawson**: I spoke to the landlord yesterday.
**Jdawson**: He said he's working on a good deal with Goodwill and he knows that we need to approve it like right away.
**Jcurtin**: The what now?
**Jdawson**: The utility ball.
**Jdawson**: He was on a call with Goodwill yesterday afternoon and they're working on a deal.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: He wants Goodwill to pay for some of it.
**Jdawson**: That's what I, that's what I would think.
**Jdawson**: I don't, I don't know why I would say they would be talking.
**Jcurtin**: So he must have got his price back and it was even more than ours.
**Jcurtin**: Well, probably.
**Jdawson**: I mean, we, we have multiple prices and they're both high, so.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Because he had a contractor in Ohio that he normally works with and that's the guy that he was going to get pricing from.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: And.
**Jdawson**: Jack mentioned they did get rain, but he, he got a pump yesterday.
**Jdawson**: So this morning he's going to be pumping out any of the water in that footer for the, for the loading dock.
**Jcurtin**: Well, you need to get.
**Jcurtin**: Uncover that drain and get that thing cleaned out, because that trench drain that's at the loading dock would solve a lot of those problems if it was cleared out.
**Ksipe**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: So I don't care if you get a labor in there.
**Jcurtin**: Take the COVID off and dig out all the dirt and clear it out so that the water will flow into that storm structure that's right next to it.
**Ksipe**: Gotcha.
**Ksipe**: Yeah, we've got some rain again over the weekend supposed to rain for the.
**Jcurtin**: Next 10 days in Indiana, according to Chad.
**Jcurtin**: So get someone out there, have them clean that drain.
**Jcurtin**: And so that then when it that water is just going to flood down that drive without the drain, it's just going to pour into your footings.
**Ksipe**: Amen.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: You have any questions, Jack, or you need anything from me.
**Ksipe**: View my notes again, make sure.
**Ksipe**: No, not anything specific right now.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: All right, well, I guess we'll.
**Jdawson**: We'll see you at the OAC meeting and then I'll send out that team's invite for Griffin at 11.
**Ksipe**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: Do.
**Ksipe**: I guess we need to.
**Ksipe**: We'll bring up to Andrew again about just like finish completion date and when we want to try to get our CO on the updated schedule that I sent.
**Ksipe**: He came by yesterday with a new project manager that's onboarding with them and the CEO of Goodwill.
**Ksipe**: And they walked.
**Ksipe**: They were happy with everything.
**Ksipe**: It was a great walk.
**Ksipe**: And then.
**Ksipe**: Oh, yes, there is one thing I want to send to you.
**Ksipe**: Have we already signed Doroo up for like, ethis patching around the building?
**Jdawson**: In what areas?
**Ksipe**: For after we.
**Ksipe**: After we do the windows?
**Jdawson**: No, he went to the site or his person went to the side and you walked with that person.
**Jdawson**: But he has not got me pricing yet.
**Ksipe**: Okay, soon as I'm gonna just send you one.
**Ksipe**: One more person.
**Ksipe**: That guy that works with Quality roofing that does EFIs, maybe he's a lot cheaper than Duru, but something else into you just keep in mind in case Duru comes with some crazy price.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: He works under Quality Roofing.
**Ksipe**: He's another contractor.
**Ksipe**: But like, usually when Quality Roofing has anything to do, like if they're on a job that involves EFIs, Jeremy said he reaches out to this guy.
**Jcurtin**: But.
**Ksipe**: Yeah, that was the only thing other than that.
**Ksipe**: I guess.
**Ksipe**: We'll talk with Andrew here in the OAC meeting here soon about CO date of August 28th.
**Jcurtin**: Good.
**Ksipe**: All righty.
**Jdawson**: Okay, hold on.
**Jdawson**: I'll talk to you later, Jack.
**Ksipe**: All right, thanks, y'.
**Jcurtin**: All.
**Jdawson**: See you, Jay.
