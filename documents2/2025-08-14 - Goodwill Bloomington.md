## Transcript
**Jdawson**: Hey, Bryan.
**Njepson**: Hey.
**Njepson**: Sorry.
**Kate.polack**: You grab the door real quick.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Njepson**: Hey, Nick.
**Speaker 3**: Hey, Bryan.
**Jdawson**: Hey, Nick.
**Jdawson**: Did you forward this to Jesse R.
**Speaker 3**: And I. I did.
**Jdawson**: And Jack.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, I'm gonna forward it to Jack as well.
**Kate.polack**: So I think there's.
**Kate.polack**: There's definitely a.
**Kate.polack**: Raising the ram I thought is an issue.
**Speaker 3**: Bryan, I'm going to send you two email addresses to add to this meeting.
**Njepson**: Sure.
**Kate.polack**: Yeah.
**Kate.polack**: Email those to me.
**Njepson**: Yeah, Sa.
**Speaker 3**: Okay.
**Speaker 3**: Did you get those, Bryan?
**Kate.polack**: No, nothing's come through yet.
**Njepson**: Oh, there we go.
**Kate.polack**: Hold off on jumping into it until they're able to join.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, if you can.
**Jdawson**: Oh, wait.
**Jdawson**: They'll have a good understanding of what you've got drawn here.
**Kate.polack**: Well, and I think there's some choices, too, on a balance between slopes and how far out, you know, do you want to.
**Speaker 3**: Are you getting on a teams meeting that you just got sent?
**Njepson**: Yes.
**Kate.polack**: Right now?
**Speaker 3**: Yes.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Njepson**: All right, bye.
**Jdawson**: And, Bryan, just to introduce Jesse R. He's our senior pm, so he's.
**Jdawson**: He's not feeling well today, but he's helping manage all of our projects, so.
**Kate.polack**: Hey, Jesse.
**Njepson**: Hey, Bryan.
**Kate.polack**: Get to feeling better.
**Speaker 4**: Thanks, man.
**Speaker 4**: It'd be nice.
**Kate.polack**: You sound a little stuffy.
**Speaker 4**: Nine days.
**Speaker 3**: There.
**Jdawson**: Jack's on, so we're good to go.
**Kate.polack**: All right.
**Kate.polack**: So trying to balance between how to wedge this thing in here, how to limit pavement, socket replacement, and how to manage slopes is all kind of a little bit of a Goldilocks of sorts.
**Kate.polack**: But there's a few kind of critical pathways that I want to make sure we were all in agreement and seeing some challenge or things to work around.
**Kate.polack**: So I think the street view here is probably like, the easiest way to sort of see it.
**Kate.polack**: You guys know this, but I'm gonna bear with me here because I want to make sure that we're on the same page in terms of how, like, I guess generally speaking, raising this rim up a little bit is okay.
**Kate.polack**: Like, there's not really.
**Kate.polack**: That's not a problem.
**Kate.polack**: It's a matter of.
**Kate.polack**: In a perfect world, we raised that thing up so that you get a nice, you know, one.
**Kate.polack**: Frankly, 1 to 2% coming out of the building through this area.
**Kate.polack**: But you can kind of tell from this view a bit the.
**Kate.polack**: This back corner.
**Kate.polack**: So back here where the dumpsters were previously, that path flow line from basically where the dumpsters are to get to this inlet is fairly flat.
**Kate.polack**: There's not a ton of slope on that, which you can sort of see in the aerial imagery where you can see it almost looks like water.
**Kate.polack**: Might like to kind of Set there a little bit the existing condition.
**Kate.polack**: So getting from kind of this area.
**Kate.polack**: Now there is another inlet up here, but this, this rim is higher.
**Kate.polack**: So trying to get water.
**Kate.polack**: This is all ripped away.
**Kate.polack**: This is all sloping down and around the corner pretty steeply to get down to this inlet.
**Kate.polack**: This inlet matching at grade certainly is deep enough or low enough to receive sheet flow from this padded area and come back here.
**Kate.polack**: But it obviously creates a heavier cross slope from the building down, which, you know, just from the street view, you can see that it would be steep coming down.
**Kate.polack**: And then you've got the other side, which is coming down at about 5% cross slope.
**Kate.polack**: I think according to what the survey picked up on the ends of these stalls, straight line grade over that inlet at kind of the steepest point.
**Kate.polack**: So there's some, you know, it's kind of a deep V, as you know.
**Kate.polack**: So looking at this, this is 0.1 foot contour shown here in black.
**Kate.polack**: So it looks like, you know, it's a lot to take in.
**Kate.polack**: But what I was looking at is trying to point out that our finished floor, we believe is around 809.78.
**Kate.polack**: I think along this face.
**Kate.polack**: The existing sidewalk is probably a little lower than the internal finished floor.
**Kate.polack**: But it's not too much different.
**Kate.polack**: It's kind of hovering around that 809.7, 809.8.
**Kate.polack**: And we had a survey finished floor shot further down to the south at 809.78.
**Kate.polack**: So we kind of used this entire storefront opening of where it's flush with the sidewalk.
**Kate.polack**: We held that finished floor 809.78, sloped across the sidewalk at 1% which dictates a top occur bottom of curve.
**Kate.polack**: That's flush, you know, right here.
**Kate.polack**: 809.74, which is, you know, this dark band is just a depressed curve.
**Kate.polack**: And then obviously it was speed if you go down and you match that 809.26 grade.
**Kate.polack**: So in looking at this, we can raise this.
**Kate.polack**: And I've in this schematic brought it to like 0.65, which still has 6% slope coming through here.
**Kate.polack**: So it's not.
**Kate.polack**: Not steep.
**Kate.polack**: But if that came to 808.65 and we used the same edge as the saw cut line here on the east, you can still get a 1%, 2%.
**Kate.polack**: But what ends up being a challenge.
**Njepson**: Is.
**Kate.polack**: There'S an existing grade here at 809.46, just kind of the southern edge of the saw cut that we were showing.
**Kate.polack**: And just try to straight grade I mean, obviously, if that came up to six, five, that's now sloping south.
**Kate.polack**: And then there's a point right here just to the south, which is existing 808.514-74436.
**Kate.polack**: And then goes in at 3:1.
**Kate.polack**: So you can tell there's a.
**Kate.polack**: There's kind of a high point between these two inlets, which would make sense because it goes from 80826 to 36 right there to 43 right there, and then to 5 1.
**Kate.polack**: And so that looks that this one that will turn a different color looks like it's kind of the high point between the two inlets in the existing conditions.
**Kate.polack**: Drains north or drain south.
**Kate.polack**: If we raise this inlet up, we could change the new high point from this orange dot to an orange dot there.
**Kate.polack**: Lift that up.
**Kate.polack**: It just means that this red area would have like.
**Kate.polack**: Because otherwise, if you start sloping back, this 0.46 ends up being a bit of a hole.
**Kate.polack**: If you don't break down and kind of do a slope where this big red arrow is between 0.75 and 0.51, you create essentially a ridge right there could be the great break between what's going to this inlet and then what ends up getting pushed down to.
**Kate.polack**: To the south.
**Kate.polack**: If that raised up to 808.65.
**Kate.polack**: You can see up here north, there's an 809.14, which is kind of the existing bottom curve.
**Kate.polack**: There's a couple of shots along this.
**Kate.polack**: This edge around 809.14 in that area that seemed a little flat kind of back in this corner.
**Kate.polack**: If you.
**Kate.polack**: If we match that, you can still get 1% kind of to here.
**Kate.polack**: And at about 1 1/2 to 2% down to that 808.65.
**Kate.polack**: So you still get positive drainage by matching grade up in this area to get around 808.65.
**Kate.polack**: So I think that this would work to raise it that much.
**Kate.polack**: And then the second point was it'd be nice to raise it even more.
**Kate.polack**: But as you can tell, if this keeps raising, two things happen.
**Kate.polack**: One, we would end up east of the inlet.
**Kate.polack**: You'd end up having to grade further out into kind of this area.
**Kate.polack**: Because, I mean, there's plenty of fall between.
**Kate.polack**: Between the edge of these stalls down to where we were showing the saw cut being.
**Kate.polack**: But.
**Kate.polack**: And that could be.
**Kate.polack**: This line here in green could be moved further east and saw cut further out and then kind of smooth that grade and lower this 6%, this 5%.
**Kate.polack**: I mean, we could get that to work real cleanly and nicely in here.
**Kate.polack**: The problem though would be this area up kind of in this zone would start to not have a positive rainwater falling out of the sky unless we started doing more of a variable height curve where the asphalt was lifted up higher.
**Kate.polack**: And it wasn't really a true 6 inch curve as much anymore.
**Kate.polack**: We were kind of artificially setting the asphalt higher so that it could, you know, drain down to a higher inlet down here.
**Kate.polack**: Sorry, that was a lot to take in to just hear me walk all the way through it.
**Kate.polack**: But I think, I mean, does that generally make sense on what I'm saying?
**Kate.polack**: And like you can raise the rim, but if you keep raising the rim, it's going to come to a point where we're going to have a hard time draining certain areas of the site.
**Kate.polack**: Because this rim up here is at 809.37.
**Kate.polack**: It's higher than the rim we're talking about here.
**Kate.polack**: So it's kind of tough to like right now I'm getting positive drainage from this whole curb line kind of softly coming around and coming into this inlet.
**Kate.polack**: But the more we raise this inlet, there's going to be less than 1% slope for kind of this area north of the canopy.
**Jdawson**: How much would you say?
**Jdawson**: And I don't know what starts to be funky if we raised it two inches up along sidewalk.
**Kate.polack**: You just would up, up, up here.
**Jdawson**: Up there.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Kate.polack**: Here I'm going to do some live catting.
**Kate.polack**: Give me a second here.
**Kate.polack**: So if we came to 2.15 higher.
**Njepson**: I'll just pick a point.
**Kate.polack**: So that'd be 809.3.
**Kate.polack**: I mean you could get this thing up to approaching 80809.
**Jdawson**: Nice.
**Kate.polack**: But then at that point you can see I'm now sloping back to the match point.
**Kate.polack**: So we'd have to.
**Kate.polack**: I'd have to move my.
**Kate.polack**: So I know it's kind of hard to explain this, but if this is an 808.95, I'd have to saw cut further out.
**Kate.polack**: But if I straight grade between this 809.5 down to that revised is still 2 1/2% slope.
**Kate.polack**: It's just there's a.
**Kate.polack**: We'd have to move this saw cut further to the right to kind of rectify it.
**Kate.polack**: Smooth that out a little bit.
**Kate.polack**: And that would take you down to 4, 4, 4.35 or so range of slope in here.
**Jdawson**: What like if from the plan view, you know where the parking spaces start?
**Njepson**: Yeah, right.
**Jdawson**: You know, on, on that right hand side if, if we just took out the pavement to then.
**Jdawson**: Cause I just, I want to have a discussion with Goodwill and just ask them, like, how flat do you want this canopy to be?
**Jdawson**: And they may say, take it all the way.
**Jdawson**: Or they may say go to that wall and we'll just take that much out.
**Jdawson**: Possibly.
**Speaker 4**: Yeah.
**Kate.polack**: I mean, if you came all the way over to the edge, I think you're going to be.
**Kate.polack**: You're still.
**Kate.polack**: If we go to 809, let's, let's just say 809 for the sake of 809 and then say we go a little bit more.
**Kate.polack**: So from there kind of up in this zone, we're getting a little less than 1%, but we could maybe, like I said, make that curve a little less than 6 inches along the space.
**Kate.polack**: So if it's at 809 and we go over to this parking stall, it's 2.27% to the parking stall, which is.
**Kate.polack**: That'd be the cross slope experience along this drive lane.
**Kate.polack**: And then at that point you'd probably end up grading from that wall edge, cutting this.
**Kate.polack**: And then if you're at 809, this would have to come up at 1% to probably 809.1.
**Kate.polack**: And then you'd be.
**Kate.polack**: That'd be your new high point.
**Kate.polack**: And from 809.1 to, you'd end up with.
**Kate.polack**: How far south do you want to saw cut in to smooth that out?
**Kate.polack**: So if you, you went all the way down to like that point, you can see it says minus 2.55.
**Kate.polack**: So you'd be sloping up at two and a half percent.
**Kate.polack**: Or you could sock up just a little bit.
**Kate.polack**: Now you'd be sloping up at 3.8%.
**Kate.polack**: But the further out you saw cut to the south, the smoother that, the less steep it gets.
**Kate.polack**: Just trying to figure out.
**Kate.polack**: You could probably go to that one and a three and a half percent uphill coming into the canopy.
**Kate.polack**: Or you could go a little bit further south, depending on how you want to do it.
**Kate.polack**: You could make this your new saw.
**Njepson**: Cut line like that.
**Jdawson**: Okay, well, if you can PDF that and send it to us, Nick, you can get a meeting with Andrew set up, see if he can jump on something like maybe right after lunch or something.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Njepson**: Get a good optical view of this.
**Kate.polack**: Yeah, because you're, you'd be basically on the flow line starting.
**Kate.polack**: You'd start to kind of have to slope up to get to a higher.
**Kate.polack**: You're sloping that way.
**Kate.polack**: You're coming back to basically there.
**Kate.polack**: So you're trying instead of tying yourself to an elevation that's lower.
**Speaker 4**: And it's.
**Kate.polack**: That corner that's the one that.
**Kate.polack**: Trying to make sure we have positive flow back from on that, on that end.
**Kate.polack**: But yeah, if we don't have to hold a 6 inch curb on this, that can help the asphalt go up a little bit more and help with this kind of critical slope.
**Jdawson**: Bryan, what is the minimum that we, you know, because these foundations are high, which started the whole concrete versus asphalt.
**Jdawson**: If, if we're raising this, however much that is, do we now have enough?
**Jdawson**: If we just only have a inch or two of base between the top of the footing and the pavement right at the columns, you know, at the top of the foundation, is that acceptable?
**Jdawson**: So we can go back to asphalt.
**Kate.polack**: Sorry, say that.
**Kate.polack**: Help me understand that a little bit more.
**Kate.polack**: Because we'd be talking about raising grade.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Raising the grade.
**Jdawson**: So currently the, the structural, you know, they put, they put the top of foundation one foot below finished floor.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: But when you come out in the parking lot, because everything drops now our footings are almost level with the pavement.
**Jdawson**: So that's why we were changing to kind of.
**Jdawson**: Well, no, Goodwill says they, that's their spec is concrete under the drive.
**Jdawson**: So we just need to stick with that.
**Jdawson**: Never mind.
**Kate.polack**: Yeah, if you do, I think the rules of play would be I wouldn't want to go any less than 1% on any like drainage pathway.
**Kate.polack**: I mean, technically you can go a little less on concrete, but I feel like you're asking for some trouble if you go less than that.
**Njepson**: And then it's just trying to kind.
**Kate.polack**: Of balance balancing act between slope goofiness and try to minimize pavement replacement.
**Kate.polack**: But I mean, if we, if we did, I'll go all the way out to a clean cut line.
**Kate.polack**: You could warp that in a lot better.
**Kate.polack**: And then it's just a matter of this kind of awkward space north of the canopy where we're trying to get it to go somewhere.
**Kate.polack**: And it really just wants to go straight at the building.
**Kate.polack**: So we're trying to kind of work it back around to an inlet.
**Kate.polack**: And it just so happens this inlet, the drive to the north, is set up higher, so we can't really divide it and go to the north and the south.
**Kate.polack**: It kind of all wants to come down to this and left to the south.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, shoot that to us.
**Jdawson**: We'll see what they say.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Kate.polack**: Yeah.
**Kate.polack**: I would put it regardless.
**Kate.polack**: Like, there's two options in my opinion.
**Kate.polack**: One, you raise it like I showed in that PDF where it goes up to 0.65 and you still have some steepness, but you're kind of still more or less honoring this, the socket replacement.
**Kate.polack**: It's just the slopes are more intense.
**Kate.polack**: Or you raise it at another up to 809, plus or minus.
**Kate.polack**: And then that softens the slopes, but requires some additional saw cutting beyond.
**Kate.polack**: Beyond the limits that were shown.
**Kate.polack**: Okay, yeah, I'll send it over.
**Kate.polack**: That's good.
**Speaker 3**: Does 130 work for you for meeting Jesse Dawson for.
**Speaker 3**: With Andrew also?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, thanks.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: I think so.
**Njepson**: All right, cool.
**Kate.polack**: I'll send this guys over to you.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Speaker 3**: Thanks, Bryan.
**Speaker 4**: Thank you, Bryan.
**Jdawson**: Thanks, Bryan.
**Kate.polack**: Appreciate it.
