## Transcript
**Jcurtin**: Okay, now I should do better.
**Jdawson**: Okay, now.
**Jdawson**: Now I hear you.
**Jcurtin**: Oh, thank you.
**Jdawson**: Doing all right today?
**Jcurtin**: Oh, no, but I did get a prescription from the doctor last night.
**Jcurtin**: Oh, really?
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, for at least the pressure in my head, because he said everything in my head is inflamed as.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jcurtin**: I don't have the flu or Covid.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, it's just, like, allergy medication.
**Jcurtin**: I don't know what it is, but I have to lay down for 30 minutes after I take it.
**Jcurtin**: I can't eat certain stuff within two hours of taking it or after taking it.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, some power.
**Jdawson**: Powerful stuff.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, it must be pretty potent.
**Jcurtin**: There's only.
**Jcurtin**: I think there's only like, 15 pills in there, so it's only like a week.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So hopefully that works for you.
**Jcurtin**: Oh, thanks, man.
**Jcurtin**: You're telling me.
**Jcurtin**: I've seen, like, a feel of.
**Jcurtin**: Like this.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Jcurtin**: Does Jack usually show up on these?
**Jdawson**: He should be.
**Jdawson**: Should be coming on.
**Jdawson**: I guess we'll just wait until.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Jackson.
**Jcurtin**: What's up, Jack?
**Bclymer**: Hey, just.
**Bclymer**: Just a couple more minutes, guys.
**Jcurtin**: Sorry.
**Jcurtin**: Nick, can you do me a favor and pull up the schedule and share your screen?
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I think Jack sent me a schedule.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Week ago.
**Jdawson**: I'll pull that up.
**Jcurtin**: Oh, if you can just send it to me, too, that's fine.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I'll do that.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: Thank you.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, I want to start getting all those so we can pay attention to them.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jcurtin**: I got it on my phone, just not in the.
**Jcurtin**: There it is.
**Jdawson**: You want me to share it on the screen?
**Jcurtin**: No, it's okay.
**Jcurtin**: I just.
**Jcurtin**: I couldn't find it, so I just wanted to be able to see it.
**Jcurtin**: But if you had it written, that's perfect.
**Jcurtin**: I had to shut my computer down finally.
**Jcurtin**: It was so tired of not being restarted.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, it happens.
**Bclymer**: Okay, I'm getting back to my computer.
**Bclymer**: I went over to alleatogroup real quick to handle that.
**Bclymer**: Nick.
**Jdawson**: Okay, well, what.
**Jdawson**: He's.
**Jdawson**: What do you say?
**Bclymer**: It wasn't that it was in the alley, because the guys know not to block.
**Bclymer**: We know not to block the alley, but we've.
**Bclymer**: Generally, while we've been out here, we've.
**Bclymer**: Everybody's been in a mutual understanding.
**Bclymer**: Like, if they're running the lift back and forth, like, we work.
**Bclymer**: We work with the drivers.
**Bclymer**: What it was was that they parked the lift overnight, not in the alley, but, like, tucked up next to the ADA ramp.
**Bclymer**: But it was, like, 10ft off the ADA ramp.
**Bclymer**: But it wasn't, like, in the alley, was tucked up against the building.
**Bclymer**: But Then the driver still, he couldn't get it in there at a certain angle, and he needed that lift gone from that space.
**Bclymer**: And it was an overnight kind of thing.
**Bclymer**: So I just told the guys, from now on, park the lift.
**Bclymer**: Park the lift inside the lay down area.
**Jcurtin**: Tell them to close one eye.
**Jcurtin**: You can get it in there just fine.
**Jcurtin**: Oh, and then go ahead, Jack.
**Bclymer**: Sorry, just talk to the Aldi store manager and just mention again, you know, anything else pops up, just give him.
**Bclymer**: Just give me a call.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And somebody's here from Goodwill right now.
**Bclymer**: Hey, how's it going?
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Do you want.
**Jdawson**: You want to walk with him, Jay?
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay, right on.
**Jcurtin**: Jack, why don't you go ahead and walk?
**Bclymer**: If y' all need anything, I'm the super for the project, so just let me know.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, Jack.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: Hey, Jack, can you hear me?
**Jcurtin**: Nick?
**Jdawson**: I. I can hear you.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, this.
**Jcurtin**: Jack, I'm just gonna mute him.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so, well, one thing I wanted to bring in, bring up is we're going to have phase one and phase two.
**Jdawson**: So we're going to have the TCO for.
**Jdawson**: Okay, the main.
**Jdawson**: Main area, and then we're just going to have the loading dock left.
**Jdawson**: So I was thinking we would probably need to build some sort of temp wall.
**Jdawson**: If I share my screen not.
**Jdawson**: Would you be able to see it, Jesse?
**Jcurtin**: Oh, of course.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, I've.
**Jcurtin**: I'm very familiar with the situations you're talking about.
**Jcurtin**: So, yeah, just talk me through it.
**Jcurtin**: And chances are it's not going to be much that we need to do to delineate this TCO space versus the construction space.
**Jdawson**: So this, when we submitted the drawings initially, this is what we had for phase one and phase two.
**Jcurtin**: But really just like an office build out or.
**Jcurtin**: No, it's a loading dock back there.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So this, this is their, like, storage area where the employees are at.
**Jdawson**: And then this is the retail floor.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And then the two things that we thought were gonna hold us up are this canopy area, which is the donation vestibule, and then this loading dock area.
**Jdawson**: But we should have this canopy area ready.
**Jdawson**: And the only thing that we would be working on now is this loading dock area.
**Jdawson**: So I was wondering if we just do like a wall like this.
**Jcurtin**: What's the ceiling look like in here and how high is it?
**Jdawson**: The ceiling is.
**Jdawson**: Is it bar exposed, 20ft high?
**Jcurtin**: It's.
**Jdawson**: It's joist.
**Jcurtin**: So it's exposed bar joist?
**Jcurtin**: Yes.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: Which direction do they run in?
**Jcurtin**: They run lengthwise of the building or.
**Jdawson**: Across right this way.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: North, south.
**Jcurtin**: And this is north up to the top of the drawing.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And we're.
**Jdawson**: We are able to do like, just some framing and then plastic up, up to the ceiling.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: Why.
**Jcurtin**: Where did you get the requirements from to build the temporary wall?
**Jdawson**: The city.
**Jdawson**: The city didn't specify anything.
**Jdawson**: So we were just going to build like the, I guess the cheapest wall.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: So here's how this works, because I've done this a bunch of times in different states.
**Jcurtin**: As long as you delineate what is work area, you don't need to get fancy.
**Jcurtin**: So a lot of times the options are hanging plastic from the ceiling and just fixing it to the bar joist with big zip ties and use duct tape as a grommet for your plastic.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: And so, but in this situation, since it's a loading dock, that's kind of stupid because it's just gonna be blowing in the wind everywhere.
**Jcurtin**: So is the area in yellow right on the other side of where we need to delineate.
**Jcurtin**: What.
**Jcurtin**: What kind of space is that?
**Jdawson**: The only space we need to block off is this space.
**Jdawson**: And this space over here, they're gonna be moving materials and storing materials and also.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: So it's not gonna be like a live area where there's gonna be people sorting, shipped and all that.
**Jdawson**: There's going to be employees back here, but not the public.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: So what I would suggest is just temporary fence panels.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: Just like, just a line of temporary fence panels.
**Jcurtin**: And then you're just gonna.
**Jcurtin**: You need a gate somewhere because you need egress.
**Jcurtin**: So I'm not sure if you need one or two, but I think you just need one in the middle of that blue area somewhere.
**Jcurtin**: That skinny one to the right of the loading dock.
**Jdawson**: If we just went maybe like.
**Jcurtin**: Yep.
**Jcurtin**: And then.
**Jdawson**: And then a gate right here.
**Jcurtin**: Well, I think you can.
**Jcurtin**: Your gate work at the end down there where it's skinny.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: Right over here.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And one.
**Jdawson**: One other thing is.
**Jdawson**: So we.
**Jdawson**: We plan on having the door in.
**Jdawson**: We.
**Jdawson**: We would just be working like on the ceiling of there.
**Jdawson**: There's an overhang right here.
**Jdawson**: And we, we occasionally.
**Jdawson**: We.
**Jdawson**: Even though this area is not.
**Jdawson**: Doesn't.
**Jdawson**: We don't have like the CO for this area.
**Jdawson**: We.
**Jdawson**: They still need to use this occasionally for trucks.
**Jcurtin**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: So we want them to be able to bring pallets.
**Jdawson**: Their pallet jack and pallets through.
**Jcurtin**: Well, that's.
**Jcurtin**: That's easy because right up there, you just don't connect the two fence panels.
**Jcurtin**: So then you can just move the Fence panel right out of the way.
**Jcurtin**: So then you'll have an eight foot wide swath for them to load and unload, or 16, whatever you want because you can swing the other two panels out.
**Jcurtin**: Does that work for them?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So just moving, moving it out a little bit and then they can bring it through.
**Jdawson**: So what you're saying.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, so they need to go through like basically in the middle of this red line you made, right?
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I would think so, yeah.
**Jcurtin**: Okay, so we just don't connect the two fence panels right there.
**Jcurtin**: You know how when you put 10 fence panels, there's the two little horse cocks on the post and you put the panel on.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: So you just don't connect them like that.
**Jcurtin**: You just use two and end feet and that way you can swing them open for them.
**Jdawson**: Got it.
**Jdawson**: Okay, that makes sense.
**Jcurtin**: So if that's enough room for them, you just need to find out what kind of width they want for traffic right there.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: And if it works like that to have the fence that way you can have it because you have an egress at that door over there.
**Jcurtin**: But I don't know if you have to have two and I don't know if the loading dock counts as one.
**Jdawson**: Well, we have, we actually have an egress door right here.
**Jcurtin**: But if it's.
**Jcurtin**: I'm saying it has to be for the area enclosed by your fence.
**Jdawson**: Oh, okay.
**Jdawson**: Do we still even have this door right here, Jack?
**Jdawson**: I don't.
**Jdawson**: I don't know if there even is a door right there.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, no, that's the electrical room.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: Okay, don't move for a second.
**Jcurtin**: Move your mouse out of the way real quick.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: I'm gonna just screenshot this area and draw it up real quick for you.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: So is this a better detail of what actually needs to be delineated?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, this is.
**Jdawson**: This is actually what it looks like.
**Jcurtin**: Okay, let me put this on here.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: So is there anyone locally that would know this answer?
**Jcurtin**: Like, do you see the building inspector regularly or anything?
**Jcurtin**: Jack, say that again.
**Jcurtin**: Do you see the building inspector regularly?
**Bclymer**: No.
**Jdawson**: Is our next inspection the final inspection?
**Bclymer**: No.
**Bclymer**: I mean, I have an above ceiling and the rooms.
**Bclymer**: Once the back dock door area gets enclosed, then I can get AC on back there and then start installing tile.
**Bclymer**: It's too humid back there to put.
**Bclymer**: Put tile up right now.
**Bclymer**: Glenmark's worried that the tile would sag due to the humidity.
**Bclymer**: And then CNS H Vac doesn't want to cut on AC back there, of course, because it Will caused the rooms to sweat with the temperature change.
**Bclymer**: The temperature change from the back receiving area to.
**Bclymer**: To those rooms with those doors opening and closing.
**Jdawson**: Okay, when you have that inspection, could you ask him about this?
**Bclymer**: Ask him about what?
**Bclymer**: I was kind of forth with the.
**Bclymer**: With the mason over text.
**Jdawson**: Okay, well, Jesse's going to mark up a temp wall and we're.
**Jdawson**: We just want to use temp fence and then we want to use an end panel and an end panel so when they make deliveries, they can just move the fence and they can bring their pail it through.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, I'm just about to send it back to you guys.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: Okay, here it comes.
**Jcurtin**: This is a real crappy drawing, but it'll get the point of grass.
**Jcurtin**: How do you message in here?
**Jcurtin**: Their chat.
**Jdawson**: Oh, did you send it on teams?
**Jcurtin**: I sent it into the meeting chat.
**Jcurtin**: Okay, so put that up on your screen.
**Jcurtin**: So is that kind of what you need to close in if you have where that door?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that would work.
**Jdawson**: And I guess I see what you're saying.
**Jdawson**: You would have egress inside.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: So I don't know if you need that second door.
**Jcurtin**: Don't like the single one down on the right end.
**Jcurtin**: That's a door symbol.
**Jcurtin**: It's just all out of whack because I used it for something else.
**Jcurtin**: So you'd have a single gate over here if you need it.
**Jcurtin**: And then you'd have the fence split right here.
**Jcurtin**: So you can just open the two panels.
**Jcurtin**: You just got to make sure you have at least 20ft right here.
**Jcurtin**: Otherwise if you, if you want to swing just one panel out, you'd have an eight foot opening and you can swing it out outside the room, inside the room, however they wanted.
**Jcurtin**: It doesn't matter.
**Jcurtin**: But if that's, if that's acceptable, then the only other thing you want to be mindful of is do you guys have any like cones or any way to delineate the feet that are on the fence because they're trip hazards?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we can get some cones.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, that's my suggestion.
**Jcurtin**: And then you just have a couple signs hanging on the fence facing the outside saying construction area, you know, whatever, PP only, all that, just the generic stuff to identify that it's a work area.
**Jcurtin**: Because if you do that and then you show the inspector you're trying to do the right thing, a lot of times they'll just be cool with what you set up.
**Jcurtin**: Okay, so is there any like dust or anything, concrete dust, anything going to be flying around in here?
**Jdawson**: There shouldn't be.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: That's the only reason you'd want to put like a poly tarp down is if there's going to be intrusive dust and all that.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, that's why originally, originally when we were going to do a wall across the whole phase one and phase two, originally there was going to be a lot more work going on in phase two other than just that doctor area.
**Bclymer**: So they were worried about.
**Bclymer**: Goodwill's most concern was about construction dust flying on like finished material and like stuff and into the receiving area.
**Bclymer**: So then we did swap out from.
**Bclymer**: Okay, if that much is going on in phase two, then let's just do like a pop type of wall because.
**Bclymer**: Okay, we, we were back and forth of like, are you more worried about security or.
**Bclymer**: Or the fact of like just dust control?
**Bclymer**: And then that's when Goodwill was like mostly dust control.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: With just the Dr. Area now being left, we, we shouldn't.
**Bclymer**: There shouldn't be much, much construction debris, you know, flying onto their material and their walls and everything.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Jack, were you, you able to get a date for when this, when they're able to use this, this loading die?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, it's.
**Bclymer**: It's still.
**Jcurtin**: What's.
**Bclymer**: What's really determining everything is the whole Georgia buggy situation as far as coming in through the front of the building and laying.
**Jcurtin**: Hey, Jack.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: Sorry to interrupt, but if they have that door on the right that I just.
**Jcurtin**: Nick just pointed out, can they get in there?
**Bclymer**: What door?
**Jcurtin**: See that Nick, Go back into that corner.
**Jdawson**: The one at the ADA ramp.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, because that's already ADA ramp especially, man.
**Jcurtin**: Holy shit.
**Jcurtin**: That's exactly what they need.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, he said he can't put.
**Bclymer**: He couldn't fit it through a three foot opening.
**Jcurtin**: Oh, he needs wider.
**Jcurtin**: I figured.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: Well, like why can't he just bring buggy up to the door?
**Jcurtin**: I mean, how far of a run is that if they're wheelbarrowing it into the dock?
**Bclymer**: So he.
**Bclymer**: Orig.
**Bclymer**: He.
**Bclymer**: What he wants to do is to be able to create like a little bit of a ramp with dirt and just bring it up through that door like you just said.
**Bclymer**: But he can't start that until the scaffolding is out of the way and it's not going to be end of next week.
**Jcurtin**: And when does he want to pour?
**Bclymer**: I wanted him if, if he could figure out a situation of what we can come come up with before the end of this week.
**Bclymer**: I have on the schedule him starting the backfill this Saturday and being Done by next Tuesday and then installing new overhead door on the 20th, and then him prepping and pouring the new slab on next Thursday and Friday.
**Jcurtin**: Okay, so Next.
**Jcurtin**: Sorry, the 22nd is when you said the scaffold will be down.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: And then you said that you're hoping to have him backfilled and complete and the overhead door installed by next Saturday the 23rd.
**Bclymer**: I have him backfill and form up the dock leveler, install rebar this Saturday the 16th, and then him take him.
**Bclymer**: Him taking three days to do that and then then allowing the electrician to then come out, come in him on Wednesday and rough in the power for the dock leveler and then installing the new overhead door next week as well.
**Jcurtin**: Okay, what's going on the following week?
**Jcurtin**: The week of the 25th.
**Bclymer**: That'S when we wanted to get our TCO.
**Bclymer**: Right now I have install bollards, fine grade and pave the new loading dock frame, the ceiling on August 28th, rough in lights and fire sprinkler on Friday the 29th.
**Bclymer**: And then to be able to enclose all that, I need an above ceiling inspection, which I had scheduled for September 1st.
**Jcurtin**: Okay, so there's no wiggle room to push that concrete guy back.
**Jcurtin**: That was all I was asking in that.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: No, not.
**Bclymer**: Not really.
**Bclymer**: Okay, I'll share my screen here now so we can just look at the same thing.
**Bclymer**: But not really.
**Bclymer**: That would really affect things and push us right now.
**Bclymer**: If we have them start on Saturday.
**Bclymer**: Our last task.
**Bclymer**: Our last two tasks happen on September 11th and 12th.
**Jcurtin**: What?
**Jcurtin**: How many bollards is there to paint?
**Jcurtin**: Because there's painters coming.
**Jdawson**: There's a total of 25 bollards.
**Jcurtin**: Okay, so it's an actual legit scope.
**Jcurtin**: It's not just five of them or something over there?
**Jcurtin**: No.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: Well, what are they painting on the.
**Jcurtin**: The eighth and ninth up there.
**Bclymer**: The new EFIs.
**Jcurtin**: Is that a different contractor or is it the same one?
**Bclymer**: Different one.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: What is that?
**Jdawson**: First and second coat jack?
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: But it's.
**Bclymer**: What.
**Bclymer**: What.
**Bclymer**: Where are we?
**Jcurtin**: My.
**Bclymer**: My understanding is that when we originally wanted EFIs back there, it was because.
**Jcurtin**: Where.
**Bclymer**: Where exactly is this EFIS going?
**Bclymer**: Is it going inside the tunnel?
**Bclymer**: Like behind the overhang?
**Jdawson**: It goes on the ceiling.
**Jdawson**: On the overhang.
**Jcurtin**: That's usually a finished material that shows.
**Jcurtin**: So basically.
**Bclymer**: Basically inside.
**Bclymer**: Like, here's the overhang that's going to happen right here.
**Bclymer**: Y' all want EFIs inside of this tunnel?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: On the ceiling.
**Jcurtin**: Gotcha.
**Bclymer**: So, yeah, that's.
**Bclymer**: That's the eephus that's being painted.
**Jcurtin**: That's so weird that they didn't just tint it when they made the EFIS material.
**Jcurtin**: I don't remember what it's called.
**Jcurtin**: You can tint that stuff right to the fate of a building that's been there for 10 years.
**Bclymer**: Is it.
**Bclymer**: Is it strange to just leave this ceiling right here exposed?
**Bclymer**: Is that.
**Jcurtin**: No, you'd want to put Ethos there.
**Jdawson**: It's going to be dense glass on the ceiling.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, yeah, they have something there to cover the ugly.
**Jcurtin**: Because dense glass ain't pretty.
**Jcurtin**: How is this schedule, the one that you just sent me, Nick?
**Jdawson**: Jack probably updated it.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, this is the most updated one.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: The one I have says H1.
**Jdawson**: Are you able to save them in a folder each week, Jack?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, Yeah, I can start doing that.
**Jcurtin**: Thank you.
**Jdawson**: Schedule folder on OneDrive.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Jcurtin**: By the end of today.
**Jcurtin**: Can you send me this?
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, I don't want to use any other ones.
**Jcurtin**: And then date it for today.
**Jcurtin**: 8, 13.
**Jcurtin**: So I know it's the one that you did today.
**Jcurtin**: And then are there any roadblocks for you guys or things that you have questions on?
**Jcurtin**: Because I got another meeting in three minutes.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we.
**Jdawson**: We can.
**Jdawson**: We can just have another meeting tomorrow.
**Jcurtin**: Okay, so there's nothing that's going to hold you up on anything today that we need to.
**Jcurtin**: Because I can.
**Jcurtin**: I have time to call you after.
**Jcurtin**: There's something I can help with.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I got a big issue with the.
**Bclymer**: With getting answers as far as getting this footing situation and figured out with the bollards at the canopy.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: Nick, can you do me a favor?
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: Can you send out a meeting invite for 11, 2 o' clock your time?
**Jcurtin**: Does that work?
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that works for me.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: Jack, does that work for you?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, it's perfect.
**Jcurtin**: Okay, let's just gather all the information you can and have it on.
**Jcurtin**: On your computer and email us anything that will help.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: And then we'll circle.
**Jcurtin**: We'll circle up then and we'll get this figured out.
**Jcurtin**: But yeah, see, just write down all the questions you have on it.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: So we don't miss any.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I'll get pictures.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, and you can set it.
**Jcurtin**: Cool.
**Jcurtin**: You can set aside an hour if that works, Nick.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: Just to make sure we have enough time.
**Jdawson**: Okay, that works.
**Jcurtin**: Sound good?
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: All right, thanks, guys.
**Jdawson**: All right, bye.
**Jcurtin**: See you.
