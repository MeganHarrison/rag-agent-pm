## Transcript
**Accounting**: Okay, guys, we are missing on Fritzi and Fatima.
**Accounting**: Give it one moment.
**Accounting**: Hi, Pretty.
**Bclymer**: Good morning.
**Bclymer**: Hello.
**Accounting**: Good morning.
**Accounting**: Everybody's here.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Accounting**: Hi, Fatima.
**Accounting**: Let's get started.
**Accounting**: Let me just share my screen with you guys.
**Accounting**: All right, let's go over there.
**Accounting**: So, financial overviews.
**Accounting**: So you shared some of the things yesterday, right, Fatima?
**Accounting**: Current budget status, outstanding invoices and receivables.
**Accounting**: Something about that.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I sent AP and AR agent.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Accounting**: Something for Brandon to look at.
**Accounting**: And Jesse.
**Accounting**: Just Brandon.
**Accounting**: I think Jesse as well.
**Bclymer**: Oh, yeah, Both of them.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Did you send those to them?
**Accounting**: I did.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Hey.
**Bclymer**: Hi, Jesse.
**Jdawson**: So which.
**Jdawson**: Which report?
**Jdawson**: I'm sorry, you want me to.
**Jdawson**: There was four attachments in there.
**Jdawson**: I got all that.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: One of them was the.
**Bclymer**: The.
**Bclymer**: I sent the receivables agent, the payables agent, and the payroll report was just to show that we have everything posted through July 12th and.
**Bclymer**: Sorry, go ahead.
**Jdawson**: Well, so that one document that I have is like the monthly billings.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: Like that doesn't match like what you guys show build.
**Jdawson**: So I.
**Jdawson**: That's just one thing we need to go through and see what's missing.
**Jdawson**: And the only thing missing on this report is the Danville theater billing, which I haven't seen yet.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So it doesn't match what's built in.
**Jdawson**: Open up your.
**Jdawson**: Your.
**Jdawson**: I just don't know which guy didn't send accounting something, that's all.
**Jdawson**: We just got to track down what they're doing wrong.
**Jdawson**: That.
**Jdawson**: Okay, it's not being registered.
**Accounting**: Do you want to share your screen, Fatima?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I'm pulling it up.
**Accounting**: That.
**Jdawson**: Okay, yeah, that's the form that I update.
**Jdawson**: And then it seemed like the one you sent with the.
**Jdawson**: There was another form.
**Jdawson**: You had the total build this month.
**Jdawson**: It was just much less.
**Jdawson**: And maybe it's updated now, I don't know.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: This.
**Bclymer**: This was the one I sent.
**Jdawson**: Oh, okay.
**Jmendez**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jmendez**: This one has the monthly billing is $4 million is the total.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And then so in the.
**Jdawson**: In the.
**Jdawson**: Is it ar aging.
**Jdawson**: Is the one.
**Jmendez**: The payments aging?
**Jmendez**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: How much is that total for this?
**Jdawson**: Like current.
**Jmendez**: Current is 3 million 2 47.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So there's like we're missing 800,000 worth of billing somewhere.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: In the summary that we have, Fatima, I put a comment there.
**Bclymer**: Where is.
**Bclymer**: There is a column if it's posted in or not.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: In.
**Bclymer**: In column K. Column K. Yeah.
**Bclymer**: This is not posted.
**Jdawson**: I see a common theme here, Brandon.
**Jmendez**: Me too.
**Jmendez**: I was just about to say that.
**Jdawson**: Roebling Homes see what.
**Jdawson**: Nick.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: These are under review.
**Jdawson**: Well, they've already sent payment for that one.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I mean, my understanding.
**Jmendez**: Yeah.
**Jmendez**: Robling Home, 1540, 135.
**Jmendez**: I just haven't.
**Jmendez**: It just hit my desk.
**Jmendez**: I haven't cashed it yet.
**Bclymer**: Okay, this one did.
**Jmendez**: It's.
**Jmendez**: It's on my desk.
**Jmendez**: Like, I just gotta take to the bank today.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jmendez**: All right.
**Bclymer**: So when.
**Bclymer**: When these are not.
**Bclymer**: When they show not posted in Job Planner, you just want us to follow up with the guys and just, you know, just let them know to approve them because they are in either draft status or need an approval.
**Jmendez**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: That's why.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: At the point we drafted this report, we just entered all the billings that were entered in Job Planner, but some of them were either, you know, under review or draft, which is why we added the accounting comments column.
**Bclymer**: That's why Fritzi added that.
**Jmendez**: Yeah, you need to follow up and with all those.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right, we'll.
**Bclymer**: We'll update it today and reach out to anybody.
**Jmendez**: What does the.
**Jmendez**: When it says notes say not started, what's that mean?
**Jdawson**: Oh, like Seminole Collective Poor Collective Goodwill Tremont.
**Jmendez**: So, like, so.
**Jmendez**: So when I look here, this says owner billing.
**Jmendez**: You know, so owner billing is.
**Jmendez**: Should be what we're billing the owner.
**Jmendez**: And so, like, if it says not started, like, it's got corn.
**Jmendez**: DEO68693.
**Jmendez**: 94.
**Jmendez**: Where did that bill come from?
**Jmendez**: And why does it say not started to the right?
**Jdawson**: Oh, I just.
**Jdawson**: I hadn't.
**Jdawson**: I didn't update that.
**Jdawson**: That's my fault.
**Jdawson**: I just.
**Jdawson**: I had put these on there when I thought we were getting them started quicker than we did.
**Jdawson**: So I just highlighted them to show.
**Jdawson**: That's why there's nothing built.
**Jdawson**: There's no budget.
**Jdawson**: They're just.
**Jdawson**: Okay, but I can hide them columns well, because it's.
**Jmendez**: It's.
**Jmendez**: It's.
**Bclymer**: But this one has actually started, right?
**Bclymer**: The chrome dam.
**Jmendez**: Okay, well, the 68, 000 had to come from somewhere.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that one is.
**Jdawson**: AJ's done that billing.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: So I think for this one in August, I think Friday or something, they posted two villains.
**Bclymer**: One for July and one for August.
**Bclymer**: I mean, one for June and July, I believe, right, Francie?
**Bclymer**: Yes, that's correct.
**Jmendez**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, it was done, like, August 1st or August 2nd.
**Jmendez**: Okay, well, yeah, let's get on that.
**Jmendez**: I mean, you can.
**Jmendez**: I think you can probably just email one person and get most of these things synced.
**Jmendez**: And then you can include myself and Jesse on that.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jmendez**: Yeah.
**Jmendez**: That way we have an accurate AR aging.
**Jmendez**: Yeah, I mean, it's the 6th of the month, and if we haven't sent out bills, I mean, it's.
**Jmendez**: We're way past.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: We'Ll do that.
**Jmendez**: What'd you say?
**Jdawson**: I was just gonna say.
**Jdawson**: And it's even more critical that, like every month, if you don't have it by the last day of the month, like the owner billing, we need to get them out.
**Jdawson**: They need to be in the owner's hands last day of the month, no later than the first, like, across the job.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: And one other thing I noticed, like, in reviewing the PSRs, the.
**Jdawson**: The cost difference of that job from the end of the month versus, you know, five days later was significant.
**Jdawson**: I can't remember which job it was, but.
**Jdawson**: And some of it was.
**Jdawson**: It looked to me like it was a commitment billing, like a subcontractor.
**Jdawson**: But if all our guys are.
**Jdawson**: If they're approving all sub paths by the 25th, is there any reason that those wouldn't post up in job planner as committed cost or cost due invoice?
**Jmendez**: Either one or two things are happening.
**Jmendez**: Either it's a glitch or they're not.
**Jmendez**: They're not posting them when they're supposed to.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, because.
**Bclymer**: Because when we had a other meeting last, I think it was early last week, looking at this, they were.
**Bclymer**: There were some adjustments between the time we looked at the first one and when we pulled this one on Friday.
**Bclymer**: So I think it may be a timing issue.
**Jdawson**: Well, today, and I don't know if it's what.
**Jdawson**: But job planners shut off and restarted like five times for me, trying to go through these things.
**Jdawson**: So I don't know what's going on with their system.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jmendez**: Just shoot him a support ticket and tell them what's going on.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Anything else on.
**Bclymer**: On this?
**Jmendez**: I don't think so.
**Jmendez**: I'm good on that.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jmendez**: Maria, you want to.
**Accounting**: Yeah, I'm going to.
**Accounting**: So give me one second.
**Accounting**: So let me share.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Accounting**: So we were.
**Accounting**: One second, please.
**Accounting**: So we were on sending balances and.
**Bclymer**: Now.
**Accounting**: Partially closing updates, issues or delays.
**Accounting**: Insurance updates are pinned.
**Jmendez**: So when I.
**Jmendez**: When I look at this, open invoices.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Jmendez**: Sheet that you guys sent.
**Jmendez**: So check to be prepared on 878-14828.
**Jmendez**: So like, like for instance, like CIH is, it says a direct cost.
**Jmendez**: Okay.
**Jmendez**: But they're a, you know, MDC cabinet.
**Jmendez**: So this says.
**Jmendez**: This is a pay app.
**Jmendez**: So why.
**Jmendez**: Why are we cutting a check this week on that?
**Jmendez**: Same thing with, you know, mechanical.
**Jmendez**: It says it's direct cost, but there Are sub.
**Jmendez**: So you know, like, you know what's going on there.
**Jmendez**: And then you've got S M. You know, like why, why are.
**Jmendez**: What are those?
**Jmendez**: All those direct costs and why are they being cut here in the, you know, the beginning of the month?
**Jmendez**: What are you looking at this sheet right here.
**Jmendez**: So when I look at this here.
**Jmendez**: Right.
**Jmendez**: So if I look at.
**Jmendez**: So I don't know what these guys are, if these guys are, if this is a vendor or what.
**Jmendez**: This is it, you know, but.
**Jmendez**: So that's a sub.
**Jmendez**: That's a sub.
**Jmendez**: That's a sub.
**Jmendez**: You know, that's a sub as well.
**Jmendez**: And it looks like it's, you know.
**Jmendez**: I understand.
**Jmendez**: I saw the email about.
**Jmendez**: Glenn is saying we need to get this paid.
**Jmendez**: So was this just not put in last month?
**Jmendez**: Was this just put in just now?
**Jmendez**: And now we got to pay this a week later?
**Jmendez**: You know, this is a sub, you know, and you know, I don't know what this is.
**Jmendez**: Architect and this.
**Jmendez**: So I don't know why are these two due?
**Jmendez**: They should be doing same thing.
**Jmendez**: They're essentially a sub at the end of the month.
**Bclymer**: I don't have the sheet for the direct cost.
**Bclymer**: It's mostly invoices coming from the notion that's that I manually entered in akumatica.
**Bclymer**: So for the pay app, it's all of the sub that has been linked or synced from the job planner for the mdc.
**Bclymer**: It's just that I based on the date because usually if they posted like the original date that has been posted here is 7 11.
**Bclymer**: So it's usually due 8, 10.
**Bclymer**: So that's.
**Jmendez**: Yeah, I get, I get that.
**Jmendez**: Yeah.
**Jmendez**: I guess what I'm asking is like, so all these subs we're supposed to be paying here this week, what job are they associated with?
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Add another column for the job for that.
**Jmendez**: Yeah, well, because I just, I want to know why we're paying differently versus versus a standard end of the month building.
**Accounting**: As I mentioned, for the direct cost.
**Bclymer**: I.
**Bclymer**: Based on the due dates of the invoices.
**Jmendez**: I, I get that.
**Jmendez**: I understand that.
**Jmendez**: But what I'm saying is, what I'm saying is these people are all subcontractors and you shouldn't have just a net thermodynamic.
**Jmendez**: It should be paid when paid.
**Jmendez**: Like I'm curious why, why we owe all of these right now?
**Jmendez**: Right now?
**Bclymer**: I think it's.
**Bclymer**: It's because they just entered invoices.
**Bclymer**: Entered.
**Bclymer**: And when she pulled it, she just pulled.
**Bclymer**: Pulled it based on the due date.
**Bclymer**: What we'll do is we'll adjust it.
**Bclymer**: Adjusted.
**Bclymer**: Add the job number, and also add if we have received the owner's payment or not.
**Bclymer**: I think that'll help identify what needs to be paid on the next check run.
**Jmendez**: I think you need to change up your microphone or something for team.
**Bclymer**: I don't think it's me.
**Bclymer**: I think it's Fritzi.
**Bclymer**: Whenever she is not on mute, it echoes.
**Jmendez**: Oh, okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: But what I was saying is that we will update this list to include the job number and if the owner.
**Bclymer**: The owner's invoice has been paid or not, I think that will help us identify what subs need to be included on what check run.
**Jdawson**: I know that one job.
**Jdawson**: I think it was Goodwill Decatur.
**Jdawson**: Like, instead of writing subcontracts or even pos, you just had them invoiced for all that work.
**Jdawson**: So those are actual subcontractors that if they want to do it that way, which I don't recommend, but it's still the same billing period where they do the work.
**Jdawson**: And then at the end of the following month is when we would pay that.
**Jdawson**: So that will help identify which job it is and identify which ones those are.
**Jdawson**: Because sometimes it's not 30 days from invoice, like Brandon saying.
**Jdawson**: It's.
**Jdawson**: It's when we get paid.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And that whole issue with, like, what is it that causes.
**Jdawson**: We write a purchase order to a sub, a PO for, like, a material vendor, we pay them, and then it doubles up the cost in the cost report.
**Jdawson**: Like, is that something that's ever going to be fixed or is it something we're doing wrong?
**Jmendez**: It shouldn't be doing that in Job Planner.
**Bclymer**: That's an issue.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, because it's.
**Jdawson**: It did it on one of Nick's jobs.
**Jdawson**: Let me find it.
**Jmendez**: Yeah, let's.
**Jmendez**: What job is it in Job Planner that's doing that?
**Jmendez**: Because that.
**Jmendez**: That.
**Jmendez**: I didn't know that was an issue.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Let me see.
**Jdawson**: Job Planner, it.
**Jdawson**: Oh, all right.
**Jdawson**: I found it.
**Jdawson**: It's on.
**Jdawson**: So on Goodwill Bloomington.
**Jdawson**: The metal stairs.
**Jdawson**: Share.
**Jdawson**: See how there was an expense this thing was paid to.
**Jdawson**: He had a PO to that same sub here under material, but the cost went here, so he had to, like.
**Jmendez**: Well, so that's just a.
**Jmendez**: That's just a cost type that may have got entered.
**Jmendez**: So 14,804.93.
**Jmendez**: So that was a PO.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: But it.
**Jdawson**: I can't remember what Nick did here.
**Jdawson**: He had to, like, go in and manually do something.
**Jdawson**: But, like, why wouldn't it?
**Jdawson**: Like, what Is it that it can't even though it's paid by a check?
**Jdawson**: Like, why isn't paid and put against the PO the material cost code.
**Jdawson**: I mean, we pay subcontractors with the check.
**Jdawson**: Like, what's the difference?
**Bclymer**: We can look at it.
**Bclymer**: Who was it for?
**Bclymer**: Fritz, you can you note that one?
**Bclymer**: We'll look at it.
**Bclymer**: You can click on it.
**Bclymer**: Jesse, can you click on it?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, it's doesn't have a name here, but.
**Bclymer**: And there's a PO for this.
**Jmendez**: What division is it right there?
**Jdawson**: Metal stairs, Division 5.
**Jmendez**: That's that right tread, I think, isn't it?
**Jmendez**: Or true step 14,004.
**Jmendez**: Is that what it is?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: No, it's aluminum stairs come out the ramp that comes out the back side of that Goodwill.
**Jdawson**: The door.
**Jdawson**: I don't know if you remember yesterday when you were there, we added that door through the back.
**Jmendez**: So I'm looking on Bloomington here, and I don't see any POS written.
**Jmendez**: Oh, I see the subcontracts.
**Jdawson**: Let's see.
**Jdawson**: I wrote it as a subcontract.
**Jdawson**: It looks like easy access.
**Jmendez**: Well, I can.
**Jmendez**: I can go.
**Jmendez**: Go over to easy access.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, easy access.
**Jmendez**: Okay, so he.
**Jmendez**: So he wrote that as budget code is 05100.
**Jmendez**: Metal stairs.
**Jmendez**: Matt.
**Jdawson**: They did a pay app, it looks like.
**Jdawson**: Is it because it was a subcontract?
**Bclymer**: Do you know what happened there?
**Bclymer**: I only see one item in the.
**Bclymer**: In akumatica.
**Accounting**: It's a pay up.
**Jmendez**: Okay, so what's it coded to?
**Jmendez**: Does it say.
**Bclymer**: It'S 055100.
**Jmendez**: Okay, and then what cost type?
**Jmendez**: Cost type.
**Bclymer**: The inventory ID is sub expense.
**Jmendez**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And who enters that as a sub expense?
**Fnjie**: Instead of.
**Jdawson**: Instead of.
**Jdawson**: Is it because it paid the whole amount?
**Accounting**: This is sync from Job Planner.
**Jmendez**: All right, so you guys need to put a ticket in with them and get that fixed.
**Jmendez**: That's some kind of glitch.
**Jmendez**: Glitch.
**Jmendez**: Okay, and then also if you go to that one, there's two budgets in here for Goodwill, Bloomington.
**Jmendez**: For some reason, if you look see here.
**Jmendez**: So something's going on here.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I noticed when.
**Jdawson**: Because which other job it was, it created like a whole nother set of cost codes in there.
**Jmendez**: Yeah.
**Jmendez**: Why does this keep happening?
**Jmendez**: I thought we fixed this.
**Jmendez**: See, like, what is with all these?
**Jmendez**: It says actual amount.
**Jmendez**: Like, what is.
**Jmendez**: What is with this?
**Jmendez**: Guys.
**Bclymer**: We might have to reach out to job planner and see.
**Jmendez**: Yeah, please put that on the list of open items.
**Jmendez**: And who's going to reach out to job planner and take care of this.
**Bclymer**: Fritzy Fritz.
**Bclymer**: He usually communicates with Kristen.
**Jmendez**: Okay.
**Jmendez**: Yeah.
**Jmendez**: Let's get this updated, please.
**Fnjie**: Updated, please.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I reached out to.
**Bclymer**: Was it AJ or Nick that reached out about his Procore budget?
**Jdawson**: Aj?
**Bclymer**: Aj Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I sent him a message saying if he wanted to meet and we can look at it so I can better get a better understanding of what he's talking about, but I haven't heard back, so.
**Bclymer**: Not sure if he's out in a field or something.
**Jmendez**: No, he's sitting right next to me.
**Jmendez**: He just sucks at communication.
**Jdawson**: Aj, we know you love talking, so we would never say that.
**Jmendez**: Send him a. Yeah, so the best way to do it.
**Jmendez**: The best way to talk to AJ is to send him like, a.
**Jmendez**: Like, Basically like some kind of golf thing or something, and then sneak in an actual, like, question, and he'll respond to that.
**Bclymer**: Good to know an answer.
**Bclymer**: Now.
**Speaker 5**: What.
**Speaker 5**: What's going on?
**Jmendez**: She wanted to meet with you about your question for the.
**Jmendez**: The issue you're having with Ulta Dallas.
**Speaker 5**: Oh, with the budget.
**Jmendez**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Speaker 5**: Fatima, if I ever don't answer you, call me.
**Speaker 5**: I always answer my phone.
**Jmendez**: That's not true at all.
**Speaker 5**: That is so true.
**Bclymer**: Well, send me a number on teams or something.
**Speaker 5**: I will send you my number on teams.
**Jdawson**: I'm.
**Speaker 5**: I apologize, guys.
**Bclymer**: Not a problem.
**Speaker 5**: I was just trying to make sure.
**Bclymer**: You got what you needed.
**Speaker 5**: We're good.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Jdawson**: It shows a revised budget in Procore, 4.7 million, which, yeah, it looks like.
**Speaker 5**: We'Re doubled up on budget.
**Speaker 5**: So I think the way the sub jobs are talking, Fatima, it's going to take a little time to dive into, but the way the sub jobs are talking with what's actually happening, because we originally did it all through sub jobs, I think, and as we've changed accounting and everything, it's communicated poorly.
**Speaker 5**: So it's been adding onto my budget, and if you look at my prime contracts, my budget's only like 3 million something and some change.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right, I'll look at it.
**Speaker 5**: So that's why I was like, it looks like things were added when sub jobs and what's been coded this year have started talking to each other.
**Speaker 5**: Yeah, it's.
**Speaker 5**: It's all messed up.
**Speaker 5**: I have the last two jobs in Procore, so we'll be done with it soon.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: I think it may be best if we.
**Bclymer**: If we can get on a call, share screens, and just look at it.
**Bclymer**: Look at it.
**Bclymer**: So just let me know what time works best for you, and I'll send you a meeting invite.
**Speaker 5**: Okay.
**Speaker 5**: That works.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Accounting**: Okay, back to it.
**Accounting**: So we have insurance updates, payments.
**Accounting**: So Fatima, what happened with finally the Arizona bond that you were able to review?
**Accounting**: The email that we received that it was vent or suspended, but it was already paid.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: The payment was made last week and I. I have the confirmation number, so I'm not sure how long it takes for them to reinstate it, but all of those were paid.
**Bclymer**: Arizona, Indiana and Carmel, I think.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Accounting**: Okay, that's good.
**Accounting**: If I receive.
**Accounting**: If I happen to receive another email or something, I'll let you know.
**Accounting**: But I think probably that was the way past.
**Accounting**: But I'll let you know.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: If you receive another one, let me know and I'll call them.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And we don't need them anymore.
**Jdawson**: Two days after they approved our California application.
**Jdawson**: I'm kidding.
**Jdawson**: But thank God we got that email like two days after, so.
**Bclymer**: Oh, go ahead.
**Bclymer**: For the 2000, are we going to.
**Accounting**: Pay it through check or card?
**Bclymer**: No, through card.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: It's due on the 8th, so make sure you do that today.
**Jmendez**: Today.
**Bclymer**: I'm not sure what you need to do on your end, Brandon.
**Bclymer**: This is one of the ones that was rejected.
**Bclymer**: Do you need to.
**Jmendez**: Nothing if it's paid by credit card.
**Bclymer**: Oh, okay.
**Bclymer**: Well, we were paying it from the bank account, so you can use it.
**Jmendez**: If you pay something from a bank account like that?
**Bclymer**: We do.
**Jmendez**: Ach.
**Jmendez**: And if it's somebody new.
**Jmendez**: Right.
**Jmendez**: Then I have to go into our account and actually approve it for the first time.
**Jmendez**: Otherwise they'll block it as fraud.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So we need to let you know when we make a payment.
**Bclymer**: Lisa was able to make that payment yesterday using the credit card, but for some reason, because the other payment got returned, they couldn't use the bank account again.
**Jmendez**: Yes, because they're douchebags.
**Accounting**: Can they try again, Fatima?
**Accounting**: Because the idea is not to use his credit card anymore.
**Accounting**: Just that one time yesterday.
**Bclymer**: Yes, I think it was just that one time.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: Okay, Sounds good.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Accounting**: What else do we have?
**Accounting**: We have accounts payable and receivables, review of pending payments, vendor issues or concerns and client billing updates.
**Accounting**: Something about that.
**Accounting**: Guys.
**Bclymer**: I think we just went through that.
**Bclymer**: I think that was what we started with.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: Okay, perfect.
**Accounting**: Payroll and compliance updates.
**Accounting**: So status of payroll processing, tax or regulatory changes.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, payroll is post posted through 7 12.
**Bclymer**: We are working on the last pay date or Jose is working on the last pay date.
**Jmendez**: Have you.
**Jmendez**: Who is responsible for like when you post that?
**Jmendez**: Going back and spot checking jobs to make sure that it's it's posting correctly to the line items.
**Fnjie**: Yeah, I am and I did.
**Fnjie**: I would like to share my screen for a few minutes if you don't mind.
**Fnjie**: Just to show you.
**Fnjie**: Can you see my screen?
**Jmendez**: Yep.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: I made a summary from the last four payrolls pay.
**Fnjie**: So this is an example, just one example for Westfield Collective.
**Fnjie**: This is the four last payrolls and the total amounts.
**Fnjie**: Then I go to job planner to review the same.
**Fnjie**: And for example, this is the 12.
**Fnjie**: This one.
**Fnjie**: The other 12 is this one, the 20th and the 14th.
**Fnjie**: I made this a check for all the jobs and for the last four payrolls.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Fnjie**: So I am responsible for that.
**Jdawson**: Good.
**Jdawson**: So now we're basically two weeks out.
**Jdawson**: There'll be a two week lag going forward on any labor costs.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: Good.
**Jmendez**: Yeah.
**Jmendez**: So looking at this sheet here like 14,671 35.
**Jmendez**: Yes, but that says 14,671 36 and then 20,891 44.
**Jmendez**: But that says 43 and then 12712 28.
**Jmendez**: That one's correct.
**Jmendez**: So do we know why we're off?
**Jmendez**: You know, I mean it's just a penny but still like do we know why the numbers aren't the same?
**Fnjie**: Yeah, that is for the decimals that we need to.
**Fnjie**: Sometimes we have and with the.
**Fnjie**: Because the eight hours we divide maybe in some by coast go.
**Fnjie**: Then it's rated.
**Fnjie**: We need to make a distribution and sometimes gives a cent.
**Fnjie**: But we can fix it because this should be the exact amount that should be sync in your planner.
**Fnjie**: But yeah we can.
**Fnjie**: We can check it in for the future payrolls.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Accounting**: Then we have.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Accounting**: Status of payroll processing on my end.
**Accounting**: So no, everything good.
**Accounting**: And we need just to make sure to add the new position for the office manager that is starting on Monday for Ashley Jessie.
**Accounting**: So once that's done, I'll set up payroll for her.
**Accounting**: So everything is set up.
**Accounting**: Next we have acumatica pending transactions issues, delays there.
**Bclymer**: Oh yeah, I sent an invoice for legacy fire protection.
**Bclymer**: I think that was for Core Mark 7, Burnville and Hirorushi.
**Bclymer**: I also.
**Accounting**: Put a comment in notion.
**Bclymer**: You said.
**Bclymer**: Who did you send the email to?
**Bclymer**: Brandon Jesse.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Accounting**: Let me see.
**Accounting**: That was provided to me by A.J.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: What's.
**Bclymer**: What's wrong with the invoice?
**Bclymer**: What do you need?
**Bclymer**: What do you need?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I. I just put a comment that there is a PO in the job planner.
**Accounting**: So we need to create an invoice for that.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Or Mark and Seva Greenville.
**Bclymer**: We also have Hero hero space.
**Jdawson**: So one thing else I noticed.
**Jdawson**: I didn't look at the details, but the ritzy.
**Jdawson**: Can you mute, please?
**Jdawson**: Okay, so in the Goodwill foundation job, like looking at the psr, he billed for more than the contract amount.
**Jdawson**: I don't know how that's even possible, but I can show which one.
**Jdawson**: With Goodwill Foundations, it's like a thousand dollars.
**Jdawson**: But can't get my job planner to work.
**Jdawson**: But looking in the PSR folder here because there's two billings.
**Jdawson**: They wrote us two pos for that.
**Jdawson**: And maybe you fixed it on the but in Job Planner.
**Jdawson**: Why it would do that, I'm not sure.
**Bclymer**: I think for the Goodwill Foundation, I think Glenn issued another owner invoice for the change order.
**Jdawson**: Well, this is.
**Jdawson**: So this was before that change order was.
**Bclymer**: I'm gonna add it on to do list to start.
**Bclymer**: Do you want us to start reviewing the pay apps and making sure that the bill today does not exceed the contract amount?
**Bclymer**: Would that be helpful?
**Jdawson**: Well, I don't know.
**Jdawson**: Why would Job Planner even let that happen?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, this is my question.
**Jdawson**: Trying to open this up again.
**Jdawson**: See here contracts on the date total completed and stored to date, total earned, less retainage.
**Bclymer**: And then the balance to finish is a negative.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: What.
**Bclymer**: What job was that, Jesse?
**Jdawson**: Goodwill Foundations.
**Bclymer**: Okay, we'll add that to the list to Job Planner to list of questions.
**Jdawson**: I was just gonna check in Job Planner if it'll open up for me and see if it's.
**Jdawson**: I don't.
**Jdawson**: This is something he redid because he was trying to bill for a change order that came in like yesterday.
**Jdawson**: Still want to go.
**Jdawson**: Just something else.
**Jdawson**: If you can ask Job Planner as you're asking them questions when it comes to like our job list, it's going to be I don't know if these jobs fall off or if they can put them in reverse order.
**Jdawson**: So the newest ones are showing up.
**Bclymer**: First off the top.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Otherwise.
**Jdawson**: Or if they have a drop down.
**Jdawson**: So you can see a hundred different jobs if they're, you know, just to try and go through them.
**Jdawson**: We're going to be paging through eight pages to try and figure out where jobs are once we get more of them here.
**Jdawson**: Here's invoice 4.
**Jdawson**: Let's say I don't like.
**Jmendez**: So the biggest thing I would say if there's something that the way that like viewing it like that you want to see like it just put a video together like of you going through it like this, shoot it to them and tell them, hey, we want to see this like and they, you know, they.
**Jmendez**: They should be able to make it happen.
**Jmendez**: Maria, if you want to get with Jesse and show him how to create a screen, share video through whatever the program is that you use through Microsoft Office that we have access to, I can't remember the name of it, then that.
**Jmendez**: That would probably alleviate some of this stuff.
**Jmendez**: And then that way, as you know, Jesse Dawson or Jesse R. Whoever, they could be like, here, like, this doesn't look right.
**Jmendez**: Can we have this?
**Jmendez**: How do we do this?
**Jmendez**: Like, and just keep pressing them on fixing this shit?
**Jmendez**: Same thing with every time there's a bug, anything like that.
**Jmendez**: Like, you know, get all that documentation, you know, because again, like, whenever we go, you know, I get to the end of the year or whatever, and I go back to Job Planner and I negotiate, I'm gonna say, listen, we had, you know, 400 tickets of glitches with you guys.
**Jmendez**: Like, that's a lot of downtime, you know, and then I can get a break on, you know, whatever.
**Jmendez**: Like, whether that's more hours for customization or they lower our fee or whatever it is.
**Jmendez**: But I want to make sure we know what that is so I can press them on it.
**Accounting**: Okay, I'll set up a minute with you, Jesse, so we can go with this.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: It looks like he redid that invoice.
**Jdawson**: So whatever he put it with, the BSR has been redone and the change order was added.
**Jdawson**: So I don't know if they'll be able to find that problem again.
**Jdawson**: But I would just ask them why you can over.
**Jdawson**: Why would they allow you to over bill?
**Jdawson**: It doesn't make sense.
**Bclymer**: Can you.
**Bclymer**: Can you send me the pay app you were just looking at with the negative?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, One thing on.
**Jdawson**: When it comes to owner payments, how quickly are those updated to Job Planner to show as invoice received?
**Jdawson**: Because if I go in there now, here's a good example.
**Jdawson**: Like, receivable invoices.
**Jdawson**: Let's see.
**Jdawson**: No contracts.
**Jdawson**: This one payments, it shows zero payments.
**Jdawson**: And I know Goodwill paid us last Friday, didn't they, Brandon?
**Jmendez**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So why wouldn't these show up already?
**Jdawson**: So we can.
**Bclymer**: For the receivable or the owner's billing, it's not automatically linked or sync.
**Bclymer**: I have already asked that one to Job Planner.
**Bclymer**: I think they have a response on that.
**Bclymer**: I usually manually do it, so maybe I. I'll just delete it.
**Bclymer**: Sorry for the delay.
**Jdawson**: I mean, if you can.
**Jdawson**: Because, like, when I'm reviewing the PSRs and then to fill out that Excel file for what we've been which just for me, it's like just puts in my spot for me.
**Jdawson**: But I guess I can just look at your report too.
**Jdawson**: But it'd be nice to have it in there as well.
**Accounting**: Okay, good.
**Accounting**: So it'll be added to the list as well.
**Accounting**: For questions we have notion next credit card transactions, calendar, timesheets.
**Accounting**: So Jose, you sent already people to do their credit card transactions and codem.
**Accounting**: So I hope they're doing it.
**Accounting**: If not just, you know, we have to presume to do that.
**Jmendez**: Where are we.
**Jmendez**: Where are we at on synced credit card costs up to what date?
**Jmendez**: Like that, that should.
**Jmendez**: So we asked this question, you know, every week.
**Jmendez**: So on that agenda, right.
**Jmendez**: Like.
**Jmendez**: Or whatever, like it should say like, you know, like these common questions.
**Jmendez**: Like so like credit card transactions.
**Jmendez**: Like, you know, it should say sync through blank.
**Jmendez**: Like whatever that date is, you know, payroll, you know, sinks through date.
**Jmendez**: Right.
**Jmendez**: You know, is it June, July, whatever.
**Bclymer**: I think it's done through July 31st.
**Bclymer**: So last email I saw from Jose, everything is pulled into Notion.
**Bclymer**: Notion through July synced with Acumatica Akumatica.
**Bclymer**: Oh, June.
**Jmendez**: Well, yes.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: June 30th.
**Fnjie**: Yes.
**Fnjie**: And we have some approved transaction around 30 transactions that we need to post in Tokyo America.
**Fnjie**: But most of them are uploaded to be coded.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Fnjie**: As of July 31st.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Accounting**: Is everybody coding their transactions and everything?
**Accounting**: Jose.
**Fnjie**: Sorry.
**Fnjie**: Is everybody coding the transactions they are doing yet?
**Fnjie**: They are, but it's a CP only in some transaction.
**Fnjie**: Yes, but.
**Fnjie**: Because those were informed yesterday.
**Fnjie**: But yes, still pending.
**Fnjie**: But I will follow up.
**Accounting**: What about calendar with Notion?
**Accounting**: Is everything good?
**Accounting**: Everything sync?
**Accounting**: I saw some of the things that are already synced on the Outlook calendar.
**Accounting**: So it's Notion Calendar updated and everything.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Fnjie**: Yes.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Accounting**: And there are some accounting tracking.
**Accounting**: So how are we doing with those issues?
**Fnjie**: Sorry, we had some accounting talking but for mainly for payroll issue.
**Fnjie**: But JC help us to fixed that.
**Fnjie**: And then we updated and are completed yet the account is again?
**Fnjie**: Yes, I completed.
**Accounting**: Yeah, I see some issues that are still in progress.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Accounting**: Like invoice receivable, payment fail, change order, non goodwill bar fail invoice, mid south electric car cold storage.
**Fnjie**: I think is under.
**Jdawson**: That Fritzis.
**Fnjie**: I guess.
**Fnjie**: Let me.
**Fnjie**: Let me check.
**Fnjie**: But I. I will follow up because.
**Bclymer**: Yes, that.
**Bclymer**: Those sound like Fritzes.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Fritzi, can you look at those and update them please?
**Bclymer**: Please.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Accounting**: And timesheets.
**Accounting**: Fritzi, how are we doing on timesheets?
**Accounting**: I know that you share some of the timesheets with Brandon and Jesse, but something you need from that part.
**Bclymer**: So far.
**Accounting**: We're updated timesheet.
**Bclymer**: Updated through the last payroll period.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, what has been coded is I think the pay date 8, 1.

**Accounting**: Guys that you need to sign something, you need them to check very urgently.
**Jmendez**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Jmendez**: Make sure we make sure we track, you know, these issues that we talked about.
**Jmendez**: Put it in our tracking and let's get it adjusted.
**Bclymer**: Okay, thank you.
**Fnjie**: Okay, bye.
