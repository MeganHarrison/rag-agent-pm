## Transcript
**Tekafka**: Hey Brad.
**Bduncan**: Hey.
**Bduncan**: How's it going?
**Tekafka**: Doing well, doing well.
**Tekafka**: How are you?
**Bduncan**: I'm good.
**Bclymer**: What's up Brandon, how you doing?
**Tekafka**: Doing well down here in our Tampa office right now, so.
**Bclymer**: Oh yeah, okay.
**Bclymer**: Awesome.
**Bduncan**: The warm weather's back here.
**Bduncan**: You can come back.
**Tekafka**: Yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: You don't have to hang out there anymore.
**Bclymer**: Indies.
**Tekafka**: I know.
**Bclymer**: 70 and sunny now it's raining here today.
**Tekafka**: I'm, you know, I was thinking, I was like what am I doing?
**Bduncan**: Yeah, I mean I tend to agree.
**Bclymer**: I'll kick it off, Brad.
**Bclymer**: I know.
**Bclymer**: Brandon, when we had lunch we were talking about just continuing to make some inroads for you to assist us in the retail branch expansion plans that we have.
**Bclymer**: And I had teed you up with another lender.
**Bclymer**: That lender has left for perceivably greener pastures.
**Bclymer**: But Brad sits next door to me and we were talking about your business and our expansion opportunities.
**Bclymer**: I wanted to just make sure that the connection was made with Brad and we continue to have the conversation about that and I was going to give you a little update on where we're at from a retail branch expansion timeline and opportunities.
**Bclymer**: But before I do that, I thought I'd, I'd let Brad just give a little introduction of himself and then you can do the same for you and your company.
**Tekafka**: Certainly.
**Bduncan**: Yep.
**Bduncan**: Brandon, I'm Brad Duncan.
**Bduncan**: I'm a commercial lender on Troy's team.
**Bduncan**: So anything I do is his fault.
**Bduncan**: Worked for center for this year, number nine going on 10.
**Bduncan**: So been in bankers years, that's millennium I think.
**Bclymer**: Uh.
**Bduncan**: So I like say I'm very familiar with Sentier brand.
**Bduncan**: Been here a long time.
**Bduncan**: Gotten to, to see us grow from I think we.
**Bduncan**: When I started in indie market we had three branches and now we're you know, eclipsing eight.
**Bduncan**: So pretty good expansion over that time frame.
**Bduncan**: I focus majority of my business on CNI lending but I have quite a few real estate portfolio offerings as well.
**Bduncan**: So right now I'm working on a couple of hotel projects and some other, you know, large scale developments that may be good for us to, to compare notes on as well when you're talking about some other development opportunities.
**Bduncan**: So like say all that being said, very comfortable with Sentira and what we can do for customers like yourselves and you know, happy to, to start a relationship where some of my customers might benefit from the services you guys offer as well.
**Tekafka**: Awesome.
**Tekafka**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: No, what about yourself?
**Tekafka**: You guys, you guys just do Indiana, right?
**Tekafka**: Troy or like north the region.
**Bclymer**: So we are based in Indiana and we prefer projects to be in the state of Indiana.
**Bclymer**: However, if somebody like you were leading a project and said, hey, I'm going to Florida or Arizona or Ohio, we could take a look at that project with your ties back to Indiana.
**Bclymer**: So, you know, your, your projects outside the state of Indiana isn't an automatic.
**Bclymer**: No, it's just we prefer to work and operate in the state of Indiana just because that's where we're comfortable and that's where our footprint is.
**Tekafka**: Yeah.
**Tekafka**: The reason I ask is just I heard you mention hotels and we have a hotel that we're in the design phases on and Georgia, like Savannah area.
**Bclymer**: And where are the, the owners of that hotel?
**Bclymer**: Are they based in Georgia as well?
**Tekafka**: No.
**Tekafka**: So I, I'm one of the owners.
**Tekafka**: But the other ones, one's in Cincinnati, one's in Grand Rapids and then I, I think Tony's in Cleveland maybe.
**Bclymer**: So what, what flag is going to fly on that hotel?
**Tekafka**: We're still interviewing a few different brands, but it's got to be signature.
**Tekafka**: So you know, one of the, whatever the boutique high end ones are.
**Tekafka**: And it'll be.
**Tekafka**: So we want to do hotel but then also have some residences.
**Tekafka**: Like I don't know if you guys have seen that model, but that's the, that's the what we're, I think we want to do like 25 residences maybe or 20, something like that.
**Bduncan**: Are you gonna rest those residences, I'm sure on the higher floors or how.
**Bduncan**: What's your design layout look like right now?
**Tekafka**: Part of that typically.
**Tekafka**: Yes, Part of it also depends on what the brand wants.
**Tekafka**: But typically you would have like, so it's a square.
**Tekafka**: Right.
**Tekafka**: And so probably let's say like you know, top left would be residences in the top right.
**Tekafka**: You're just still gonna have some, some hotel room.
**Tekafka**: So it wouldn't all be the top fours residences.
**Tekafka**: It would be okay.
**Bduncan**: Seen designs for both elements.
**Bduncan**: So just curious on how you guys plan to lay that out because some brands want to maintain, you know, every floor structure so that way they can accommodate the penthouse request, you know, the upper, upper tier suites request.
**Bduncan**: So I was curious on how you guys map that out near your plans for this one.
**Tekafka**: Yeah, again, it just depends like, like you said on the brand.
**Tekafka**: So that's, that's still kind of up in the air on what, what we do on that.
**Tekafka**: Because it's, it's got to be a collaboration.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Tekafka**: So yeah.
**Tekafka**: So anyway, so I'll, I'll let you know more about that.
**Tekafka**: But that was just a, you know, question.
**Tekafka**: So.
**Tekafka**: Yeah, A little bit about us.
**Tekafka**: So I started the company a little over three years ago.
**Tekafka**: We have office in Indy, office in Tampa.
**Tekafka**: We do work in numerous states across the country.
**Tekafka**: I think right now we've got jobs going on in, let's see, Florida, Tennessee, Texas, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Indiana of.
**Tekafka**: I think.
**Tekafka**: And then I think that may be it.
**Tekafka**: Then we've got several in design in different states like Georgia, Kentucky, I don't know, I can't remember.
**Tekafka**: I'd have to look at a list.
**Tekafka**: But, you know, we stay decently active and yeah, so I split time between the two kind of as needed.
**Tekafka**: Goal is to get our next office would be Nashville and then Houston and Atlanta.
**Bclymer**: And give Brad a little flavor of what you had done historically.
**Bclymer**: Before you launched your company, you had quite a successful run in aligning with some hospital builds, right?
**Tekafka**: Yeah, so I cut my teeth building hospitals.
**Tekafka**: So I nice.
**Tekafka**: I was building a lot for Encompass Health, which used to be called Health south, and HCA Hospital Corporation America.
**Tekafka**: So mainly in the south southeast market.
**Tekafka**: So I was all over Florida and Georgia and everything Panhandle and built several hospitals.
**Tekafka**: And then in 2019, I moved up to Indianapolis, came on board at a small firm at the time called Peterson.
**Tekafka**: Quickly rose the ranks, made vice president.
**Tekafka**: Kind of brought them from their little neighborhood, you see, to.
**Tekafka**: I came in, you know, from a, you know, billion and a half year revenue company saying, hey, guys, here's how.
**Tekafka**: Here's how the big boys do it.
**Tekafka**: And so, yeah, so I stayed there for a while and then I was like, well, they offered me ownership, but it was split between six people.
**Tekafka**: I had to wait like eight years.
**Tekafka**: And I was like, I already have the most profitable division of the company.
**Tekafka**: I think I'll just take my chances on my own.
**Tekafka**: So.
**Bduncan**: It'S a big gamble, but obviously.
**Tekafka**: I mean, I figured worst case scenario, I literally, I was like, well, yeah, worst case scenario, I fail and I'll go back and make 100.
**Tekafka**: Go back with somebody, right?
**Tekafka**: Anybody.
**Tekafka**: Somebody's like, I.
**Tekafka**: I'm already an excellent at what I do.
**Tekafka**: Like, is that like, somebody's gonna take me?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bduncan**: No, I just, I mean, it's.
**Bduncan**: It.
**Bduncan**: It's still.
**Bduncan**: It's still a, you know, leap of faith and bet on yourself to.
**Bduncan**: To go out and do that.
**Bduncan**: So you started, obviously, you know, from scratch.
**Bduncan**: How many employees you guys have now?
**Bduncan**: Tell me about, you know, the journey and where you guys find yourselves today.
**Tekafka**: Yeah.
**Tekafka**: So how many employees do we have now?
**Tekafka**: I.
**Tekafka**: I think we have like 16 or 17 now.
**Tekafka**: I know, like we just, I've kind of turned over hiring to my vp, so I, I don't, I don't do it as much.
**Tekafka**: My job is to, you know, do most of sales and just give him the resources he needs.
**Tekafka**: But I think we're like 16, 17, something like that.
**Tekafka**: Maybe 18.
**Tekafka**: We'll do 30 million in revenue this year.
**Bduncan**: Nice.
**Tekafka**: You know, we, we.
**Tekafka**: Our biggest thing is I, I like, you know, we focus on working with people that we like.
**Tekafka**: So we don't, you know, we're forcing in the aspect that we can say no to people, which is power in itself.
**Tekafka**: So we like to work with people that are good to work with.
**Tekafka**: Life's too short to deal with somebody who sucks.
**Bduncan**: Yeah, there's customers that we've had to fire over the years.
**Bduncan**: I completely understand that.
**Tekafka**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bduncan**: It'S quite, I mean, obviously it's a great revenue number.
**Bduncan**: You guys, you know, jumped up assumably pretty, pretty solid over those time frames.
**Bduncan**: Banking partners.
**Bduncan**: Now, who do you guys, who do you guys like?
**Bduncan**: What do you guys like about them?
**Tekafka**: So our, our main bank is Chase.
**Tekafka**: That's where all our payments and everything go in and out of.
**Tekafka**: And, and really the main reason for that is branches because I can be anywhere in the country and if I need to get to a branch for some reason, I can do that.
**Tekafka**: It's also just where I was baking at the time personally, so it was just easy.
**Tekafka**: And then we also have a banking relationship with Forum.
**Tekafka**: We also, we have a line of credit with them.
**Tekafka**: We don't.
**Tekafka**: I mean, Chase has asked me about it and I just am like, oh, yeah, yeah, I'll do it, like, but I just don't ever do it because they're kind of a pain in the ass and I, I just don't care that much.
**Tekafka**: We don't, you know, we don't need it.
**Tekafka**: I mean, we have a, I think 750, 000 line.
**Tekafka**: Plus I've got another 300, 000 line with my brokerage.
**Tekafka**: So we, we're, we've got the money as needed.
**Tekafka**: I mean, we're.
**Tekafka**: Every year I always like, like today, like, literally, I just wired 400 grand back to Forum because I pulled it out for six weeks just because they have to make some money off me.
**Tekafka**: And so every year I just make it a point to pull, keep it for, you know, four to eight weeks and then send it back.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: And, and Brandon, just to remind you, Brad was the one that teed up the opportunity in Whitestown that you had a Very competitive bid for the dentist dentist office in.
**Bclymer**: In Whitestown.
**Bclymer**: They ended up going with.
**Bclymer**: Was it Shamrock or better.
**Bclymer**: It was Shamrock.
**Tekafka**: We.
**Tekafka**: We were low and then they had some trouble with Shamrock.
**Bduncan**: They did.
**Bduncan**: And I.
**Bduncan**: We tried to I think reflect that.
**Bclymer**: They probably would have wished.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I think they probably would have wished.
**Bclymer**: They would have went with you.
**Bclymer**: Brandon and.
**Bclymer**: And Brad even said that post close.
**Bclymer**: Post construction that hey, we probably would have been better served had gotten that deal.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Tekafka**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bduncan**: Shamrock seemed to be in a.
**Bduncan**: I mean they're.
**Bduncan**: They were asking for capital as quick as they were building the sticks and.
**Bduncan**: And that's always a sign of something that may be on the back.
**Bduncan**: In the back of the scenes.
**Bduncan**: And we found some issues that they had to clean up before we could release those.
**Bduncan**: You know, just.
**Tekafka**: Yeah, y.
**Bduncan**: Unfortunately.
**Bduncan**: Unfortunately you can try and coach a customer.
**Bduncan**: So any way sometimes they see, you know, oh, my friend built a dentist office through share, you know that that's what they thought they trusted just didn't work out.
**Bduncan**: So.
**Bduncan**: Yeah, opportunities like that are ones we try and kick over to people that we know that can complete a job.
**Bduncan**: Certainly makes it easier on our customers and on ourselves.
**Tekafka**: Yeah.
**Tekafka**: Yeah.
**Tekafka**: But you know, people, they'll live and learn.
**Tekafka**: So I mean it's.
**Tekafka**: I hate to see it, but it, you know, you can't.
**Tekafka**: Can only do so much.
**Tekafka**: So.
**Bduncan**: Yeah.
**Bduncan**: So.
**Bclymer**: So eventually we'll want Brandon to be able to bid on our retail expansion plans and.
**Bclymer**: And some of the build outs.
**Bclymer**: I'll give you a quick update Brandon, on where we're at in market.
**Bclymer**: As Brad said, our expansion has been good in Indy over the past 24 months or so.
**Bclymer**: We launched three new branches in 2024 which you had even reached out and.
**Bclymer**: And mentioned 62nd Allisonville was an old Chase bank converted into a center.
**Bclymer**: Same at 86th and ditch Myron agent did I think a couple of those in our Brownsburg office.
**Bclymer**: Same way.
**Bclymer**: It was an old Chase bank that was converted now into ours.
**Bclymer**: We've got four on the kind of the.
**Bclymer**: The radar screen that should start in some way shape or form in the next six to 18 months.
**Bclymer**: Probably the first one will be Westfield.
**Bclymer**: We're gonna.
**Bclymer**: We've.
**Tekafka**: Everybody's going up there places booming.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: So west of 31 there on 32 we had a spot didn't end up materializing that the guy we were dealing with ended up saying he couldn't lock in with us.
**Bclymer**: So we're.
**Bclymer**: We've pivoted to down closer by Meijer at Springmill Point.
**Bclymer**: I think is what it's called.
**Bclymer**: So we are close to locking in that ground and then we'll be working on architectural plans, et cetera.
**Bclymer**: So that one will probably be the first one.
**Bclymer**: We also have ground ground locked in at Hamilton town Center at 146 and I think that's Bolden just west of the new Cane's restaurant.
**Tekafka**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: It'll be the hard hard corner there on the, that north east corner there.
**Bclymer**: That will be a full build.
**Bclymer**: And then as banks expand in communities, you always have to drop into a load of mod area to appease the regulators and stay off their bad list.
**Bclymer**: So we have been looking at sites in and around the 56th and Georgetown area.
**Bclymer**: There's an old PNC bank that we tried to get PNC had a restrictions on bank restrictions on going in.
**Bclymer**: So I don't think that's going to materialize.
**Bclymer**: There's also a vacated, I think a closed Boston Market and maybe even an old Wendy's over there that we're actually looking at doing in addition to that.
**Bclymer**: And we've talked about our Avon location.
**Bclymer**: Brandon, we are likely going to go into that Swensons, the old Swensons lot which you had said, hey, let me take a swing at retroing that building to fit what you might like.
**Bclymer**: So we would determine based on input from guys like yourself do we scrape and rebuild or do we or do we just expand and re image that current building?
**Bclymer**: So that is on the horizon.
**Bclymer**: In addition, Greenwood, we've got two locations that we've, we haven't locked in both but we're pretty far down the road with, with two in Greenwood as well.
**Bclymer**: So we've got about five new builds that will be hitting us in the next six to 24 months.
**Bclymer**: And then beyond that we want to go further south into Bloomington, Columbus, potentially Evansville.
**Bclymer**: So you know, our, our growth plans, yeah, our growth plans are certainly state of Indiana.
**Bclymer**: We have no aspirations of going outside the state, but we got a lot of, we got a lot of growing and building to do in Indianapolis and then beyond and certainly a community like Lebanon that's got all the expansion going that ties nicely to our Lafayette and then northwest Indiana headquarters too.
**Bclymer**: So that expansion up and down 65 too.
**Bclymer**: So a lot of opportunity.
**Bclymer**: And as I stated at lunch, one of the first things that, that our internal team asks for somebody that wants to bid is are they an existing customer?
**Bclymer**: So that's why I thought we could have further dialogue and conversation.
**Bclymer**: And you know, even if it's a money market account with a few, few dollars in it that checks the box to say, hey, they are.
**Bclymer**: They are a customer.
**Bclymer**: So I thought we'd at least start this dialogue to make it easier when the bidding process comes, that we can check that box and help out.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Tekafka**: Yes, certainly.
**Tekafka**: So.
**Tekafka**: So, Troy, are all those ones that you listed, those are all just your actual market, but you have other market presidents, right?
**Bclymer**: That's correct, yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So the other market that would get capital expansion dollars would be Fort Wayne.
**Bclymer**: Fort Wayne has opportunities up there, and so, yes, that market president helps with that.
**Bclymer**: The person that you would be working with, however, to do the Indy is also responsible for those markets as well.
**Bclymer**: So Dan Plank and Deborah Lumpkin are kind of the two that, that we were very closely with.
**Bclymer**: So once that alignment introduction happens, the outreach to those other markets should be seamless as well as you'll have familiarity with.
**Bclymer**: With them and vice versa.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Tekafka**: Perfect.
**Tekafka**: Yeah, no, definitely.
**Tekafka**: I know we talked a little bit about, like, I think in money marketing, money market account is pretty easy and straightforward.
**Tekafka**: And then probably, I don't know, you know, if you guys do lines of credit or, you know, probably look at that.
**Tekafka**: That's usually pretty easy.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Tekafka**: Just to get something going.
**Tekafka**: That way you guys can.
**Tekafka**: Not that you don't make money on a money market account, but you make more money off of a line of credit.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Do you have a line in place with Chase today?
**Tekafka**: No.
**Tekafka**: So Chase, they keep asking me and they're like, here, fill out 30,000 pages.
**Tekafka**: I'm like, I don't have time.
**Tekafka**: And then we, we have, I think 750 with forum, and I got another 300 or so with my brokerage.
**Bclymer**: 750.
**Bduncan**: Is that forum?
**Bclymer**: F.
**Bclymer**: Forum.
**Bduncan**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bduncan**: And I, I think we could mimic something that they, they've offered to you.
**Bduncan**: You know, we could certainly put something together like that.
**Bduncan**: We could say, you know, if there's further expansion, you guys see some, some big points this year, we can, we can put something in there and then retaining cash.
**Bduncan**: I think, as always, you know, if you trust us with your deposits, I think that shows us a lot as well.
**Bduncan**: So I think there's values on both sides of the fence that'll allow us to see you in a, in a good light and make, you know, our company realize that there's a bigger relationship, we want to expand, so very simple to do.
**Tekafka**: Yeah, certainly.
**Tekafka**: But, yeah, I mean, like I said, we're, you know, definitely open to, to getting some of those accounts started and, and built and funded.
**Tekafka**: And then I Mean, yeah, long term, you know, we'll.
**Tekafka**: We'll probably end up, you know, switching from.
**Tekafka**: From Chase.
**Tekafka**: It's just right now it's moving accounts is a big deal because everything is.
**Tekafka**: Everything is tied.
**Bclymer**: And.
**Tekafka**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: We understand that that takes time and trust.
**Bclymer**: And so this a way to dip your toe in the water here.
**Bclymer**: Do you have remote deposit capture with Chase where you're able to deposit checks through a remote deposit attached to your computer in your home office?
**Tekafka**: We don't, but we don't have a ton of checks that we're depositing because it's all typically electronically.
**Tekafka**: I mean, some.
**Tekafka**: Sometimes we get checks.
**Tekafka**: It depends on the client.
**Tekafka**: It's not.
**Tekafka**: It's.
**Tekafka**: I would say it's.
**Tekafka**: I don't know, maybe 20 of the time.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Tekafka**: So not.
**Tekafka**: Not like we have a zillion checks that we're doing.
**Tekafka**: Sure.
**Tekafka**: And then we.
**Bclymer**: We.
**Tekafka**: We actually cut all the checks that we pay because I ref.
**Tekafka**: I just.
**Tekafka**: I do not do ach.
**Tekafka**: So, like, when I first started this company, within my first six months, I had $115,000 stolen out of our account.
**Tekafka**: Yeah.
**Tekafka**: So scammers, like, somehow went in there and they, like, did a test deposit to where, like, they took the money and threw it into some retirement account thing, like a schwab or whatever.
**Tekafka**: And at the end of the month, my, like, the guy doing the books is like, hey, man, what do you want me to do with this?
**Tekafka**: You know, money?
**Tekafka**: Is this just the owner dividend or what?
**Tekafka**: What are you talking about?
**Tekafka**: And I.
**Tekafka**: It had been like 20 days and it's gone, man.
**Tekafka**: I was like.
**Tekafka**: So since then, I mean, I went to the bank immediately.
**Tekafka**: I said, we have a big problem, unfortunately.
**Tekafka**: I mean, you know, Chase ate the loss and put the money right back in.
**Tekafka**: And then we.
**Tekafka**: From that moment on, I have a.
**Tekafka**: Like the.
**Tekafka**: The tightest security on our bank account.
**Tekafka**: Like, not a.
**Tekafka**: If a penny moves in or out, I get a text message from it.
**Tekafka**: And like, zero ACHs can go out unless I manually go in and mark them as approved.
**Tekafka**: And then I'll set, like, a certain limit amount y on that.
**Tekafka**: On that stuff.
**Tekafka**: Like, so, like, that's the one thing I'd say that, you know, for.
**Tekafka**: For me, like, is a must.
**Tekafka**: Any.
**Tekafka**: Anytime we ever switch anything is like, I have to have the tightest security on our actual account.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And we got the guardrails we can put on it.
**Bclymer**: And sadly, Brad and I see it behind the scenes all the time.
**Bclymer**: These scammers are good.
**Bclymer**: They're good.
**Bclymer**: Like, they're really good.
**Bclymer**: And we, yeah, we, we see the attempts all the time.
**Bclymer**: So I'm glad.
**Bclymer**: I hate that you had that issue happen early, but that, that's kind of put you in a position to where you agree with us.
**Bclymer**: Like, lock it in, don't let, you know, limit the amount of people that do it.
**Bclymer**: Because once that money's gone, poof, it's gone.
**Tekafka**: Oh yeah.
**Tekafka**: I mean, I have it now.
**Tekafka**: Like, you know, I'll have vendors like, well, can you ach it?
**Tekafka**: I'm like, no.
**Tekafka**: Like, I'm not doing, like, I'm not like, I have very limited, like our payroll, like a few different vendors that I, I have it set up with.
**Tekafka**: But it's just, you know, if I have, if I have too many to track, then it just opens it up to, to some kind of issue.
**Bduncan**: So you cut, you cut a lot of physical checks.
**Bduncan**: That's your process.
**Bduncan**: Do you guys use positive pay then as well?
**Bduncan**: I'm assuming or no.
**Tekafka**: What's positive pay?
**Bduncan**: Positive pay is a verification.
**Bduncan**: So like let's say you cut 15 checks in a day.
**Bduncan**: You have a spreadsheet mapped out that says know $10,000 is being written to Mark Jones on check number 133.
**Bduncan**: You send bank and bank checks it off against it.
**Tekafka**: So our accounting software tracks it.
**Tekafka**: So as they all get cut, our accounting software says, ABC supply, $12,000 check, 435 or whatever.
**Bduncan**: Okay.
**Tekafka**: And then, so every, and then as it gets cashed, our accounting team goes in and reconciles in the bank.
**Tekafka**: Because the bank says, okay, 434 is cash.
**Tekafka**: Boom, boom, boom.
**Tekafka**: Check.
**Bduncan**: Yeah, positive pay is just a way for the bank to, to perform some of that action as well.
**Bduncan**: You know, it's another fraud, fraud preventative.
**Bduncan**: You know, some people that are as diligent as you sometimes utilize that as well.
**Bduncan**: So I was just curious to know if that was something you guys had on structure.
**Bduncan**: You have another way that works?
**Bduncan**: That's fine.
**Tekafka**: We, I, I sign every check personally.
**Tekafka**: So that's also kind of a, a cross check.
**Tekafka**: Because if I, if someone's question, I just put it to the side and then I'll look it up.
**Bduncan**: Yeah.
**Bduncan**: The biggest thing positive paper events is like a check washing where somebody comes in, scrubs off the other side of the data and then they, you know, juice that check up to nine grand where it's supposed to be for one.
**Bduncan**: And so we catch it on the front end as opposed to having to wait for it to hit your account team.
**Bduncan**: So again, just a Another thing you guys can think about, if you get to the point where you're having those concerns right now, probably doing enough to recover yourselves, which is great because not everybody's got the checks and balances we want to see when it comes to monitoring their funds.
**Bduncan**: So, like I said.
**Bduncan**: I know, I know.
**Bduncan**: We're kind of coming up against it.
**Bduncan**: So I saw the five minute warning, and I want to be conscious of your time.
**Bduncan**: But as far as setting those things up, you know, in terms of accounts, you're obviously a signer.
**Bduncan**: Anybody else in the team that you guys have as a backup for when you're able to take a vacation or at office, anything like that, or just you as the only.
**Tekafka**: What did you just say?
**Bduncan**: You're in Tampa, man.
**Bduncan**: I got to assume that you take a vacation every once in a while.
**Tekafka**: Troy, obviously, he doesn't understand how work was exactly.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bduncan**: He'S.
**Bclymer**: He's 24 7, Brad.
**Tekafka**: Yeah.
**Bduncan**: I came from a family of business owners, but, you know, realistically, they had partners in a lot of those things, so we, we had a lot of, you know, redundancies across the.
**Tekafka**: I'm the only.
**Tekafka**: I'm the only signer.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, and that's good, too.
**Bclymer**: Well, if this is okay with you, Brandon, Brad will kind of send an email recapping our conversation, giving you some details on what a line of credit might look like, rate, and a checklist of items that we would need to proceed.
**Bclymer**: It won't be 30,000 pages, it might just be 10 pages.
**Bclymer**: But in any event, he can at least lay that out.
**Bclymer**: In addition to that, the money market details what our rate would be and the details behind that and what we would need to set that up.
**Bclymer**: I, as I said at the onset.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, just kind of getting started with a money market and talking about the line of credit and then kind of inching our way into everything.
**Bclymer**: The money market certainly would still check the box to say that Brandon and company are a customer and, and we want them on the list to be able to.
**Bclymer**: To bid on projects.
**Tekafka**: So just make sure you cc Maria on it as well that way, because she's gonna organize all that information.
**Tekafka**: Sure.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Bduncan**: Easy to do.
**Bduncan**: And then we'll make sure that, that it's all over to you.
**Bduncan**: Anything specific that you want to see beyond those items that we've neglected to address today?
**Tekafka**: No, I think that's good.
**Tekafka**: Good starting basis.
**Tekafka**: You know, whenever we get it opened, you know, I'll go in, the UI will tell me a lot, like, you know, how easy is it for Me to get around.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Bduncan**: Yeah, I think that's fair as well.
**Bduncan**: Then when you do get back in town, I'd love to grab lunch or something, talk about some of the customers that I've.
**Bduncan**: That I've got that may be a fit for you guys as well beyond since here.
**Tekafka**: Yeah, for sure.
**Tekafka**: And you know, you said just feel free to give me a call or a text or email.
**Tekafka**: Happy to.
**Tekafka**: You know, I know that we're all busy, so don't have to wait for lunch.
**Tekafka**: So anything you got, happy to look at it.
**Bduncan**: No, yeah, for sure.
**Bclymer**: And.
**Bclymer**: And when you respond to the email, if you do have any details on that hotel in Georgia, flip that in there too, and we'll.
**Bclymer**: We'll give you our thoughts on it.
**Tekafka**: Yeah, we.
**Tekafka**: So I have to look at.
**Tekafka**: I've got a.
**Tekafka**: One of our designers drop the new site plan in my inbox on Friday.
**Tekafka**: So right now we've.
**Tekafka**: So the land is.
**Tekafka**: It's a lease to own, like releasing it for a dollar a year for 10 years and then we buy it out for a dollar from the municipality.
**Bclymer**: Nice.
**Tekafka**: And so they wanted an updated site plan because originally it was just like this sports facility thing and but then they said, hey, will you guys build a hotel here too?
**Tekafka**: And we said, yeah.
**Tekafka**: And so they said, all right, cool.
**Tekafka**: Give us a site plan that combines the both.
**Tekafka**: So.
**Tekafka**: Nice.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, sounds familiar.
**Bduncan**: To another project we were talking about.
**Bduncan**: Yeah, yeah, yeah, that.
**Bduncan**: That's great.
**Bduncan**: Easy to work with.
**Bduncan**: You got any tiff exposure inside of that development as well, or.
**Bduncan**: No.
**Tekafka**: I mean, the land going for free is pretty.
**Bduncan**: I don't disagree, but I'm just curious if there's, you know, this.
**Bduncan**: If there's a.
**Bduncan**: The sport complex piece to it too.
**Bduncan**: Sometimes there's a bit.
**Tekafka**: Well, so yeah, there's abatement.
**Tekafka**: The only tiff exposure really, if we have any, is.
**Tekafka**: Is they would.
**Tekafka**: They would pay for the actual courts and stuff themselves, but in reality, USA volleyball is coming in and they're going to take care of that.
**Tekafka**: So.
**Bduncan**: Nice.
**Bduncan**: Very cool.
**Bduncan**: Let's.
**Bduncan**: I know we're.
**Bduncan**: We're cutting right on your time, so I want to be, you know, value that and if you need anything, my cell phone, email, all the stuff's available to you.
**Bduncan**: I'll do a follow up.
**Bduncan**: Cece, Maria, as you'd asked.
**Bduncan**: And then if there's anything else that crosses your mind, please feel free to reach out.
**Bduncan**: We'd love to connect on this.
**Tekafka**: Well, there.
**Tekafka**: Awesome.
**Tekafka**: Awesome.
**Bclymer**: Appreciate your time, Brandon and team.
**Bduncan**: Yeah, have a good one.
**Tekafka**: See you guys.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: See you by.
