## Transcript
**Sclevenger**: Hey, Sean.
**Cmortensen**: Good morning.
**Cmortensen**: How are you?
**Sclevenger**: I'm so.
**Sclevenger**: I'm so sorry I'm late.
**Cmortensen**: No problem.
**Cmortensen**: I can still work.
**Sclevenger**: Yeah.
**Sclevenger**: Okay, good.
**Sclevenger**: I'm doing well.
**Sclevenger**: One second here.
**Sclevenger**: I'm in the car right now.
**Cmortensen**: Okay.
**Sclevenger**: I actually was just on site and I lost track of time.
**Cmortensen**: Okay.
**Sclevenger**: So I'm up here in Carmel, but yeah, so we're starting on Monday, full force.
**Cmortensen**: Good deal.
**Cmortensen**: Good deal.
**Cmortensen**: Relief for everyone.
**Sclevenger**: Yeah.
**Sclevenger**: Yeah.
**Sclevenger**: So we'll see how quick we can get her done.
**Sclevenger**: I don't have a permit yet still, but I'm just.
**Sclevenger**: I have the approved amendment letter.
**Sclevenger**: I'm just starting.
**Sclevenger**: They can slap me on the wrist.
**Sclevenger**: They can slap me on the wrist if they want, but at this point, it's ridiculous how long it's taken, so.
**Cmortensen**: So right.
**Cmortensen**: Right.
**Sclevenger**: I'm just going to go ahead and start and we'll get the openings cut and we'll just knock it out quickly.
**Cmortensen**: Okay.
**Cmortensen**: It will all be done before we know it.
**Cmortensen**: I know how that goes.
**Sclevenger**: Yep.
**Cmortensen**: Okay.
**Cmortensen**: I don't have anything new.
**Sclevenger**: Yeah, I know.
**Sclevenger**: Glendon and I chatted about wanting to figure out how we want to do addresses.
**Cmortensen**: Right.
**Sclevenger**: I'm.
**Sclevenger**: I'm looking into that for you guys.
**Sclevenger**: I don't have.
**Cmortensen**: And A.J.
**Cmortensen**: i can.
**Cmortensen**: I can look, I can call and get those addresses.
**Cmortensen**: I just know some cities will not issue an address without a building permit when it's a new space like that.
**Cmortensen**: So that's why I thought maybe you already were familiar with the.
**Cmortensen**: How that worked.
**Cmortensen**: Okay.
**Sclevenger**: I'm not familiar with it, but I can call.
**Sclevenger**: I would wait either way until we have a building permit.
**Cmortensen**: Okay.
**Cmortensen**: Okay.
**Sclevenger**: So.
**Sclevenger**: And then.
**Sclevenger**: And then I can ask.
**Sclevenger**: I can actually ask the building inspector.
**Cmortensen**: Okay, that would be.
**Cmortensen**: Okay.
**Sclevenger**: She hadn't said anything yet.
**Sclevenger**: Yeah, he'll know who to go to.
**Sclevenger**: That way you're not just aimlessly calling, you know, Right.
**Sclevenger**: When you call the city, you get like a call.
**Sclevenger**: Front desk lady.
**Sclevenger**: And.
**Cmortensen**: Well, and it's interesting when from county to county, it could be a different department that sets those.
**Cmortensen**: I've just had different departments, so it depends on the county.
**Cmortensen**: It's never the same entity that sets that address, but okay, that works.
**Cmortensen**: I had told him.
**Cmortensen**: And I don't know what your thoughts are, but.
**Cmortensen**: But because the rest of the shopping center has addresses or street addresses, so to speak, I would prefer to go that route versus the suites.
**Cmortensen**: But we don't have to if they don't want to go that route.
**Sclevenger**: Yeah, it's going to be totally up to the city.
**Sclevenger**: Whatever they Think.
**Cmortensen**: Okay.
**Sclevenger**: So I would assume.
**Sclevenger**: But we'll ask the question and hopefully get a speedy response.
**Cmortensen**: Okay.
**Cmortensen**: Okay.
**Cmortensen**: Okay.
**Cmortensen**: Yeah, that sounds good.
**Cmortensen**: Because actually, FedEx had sent me a form to fill out, and that's what brought that to my attention, to get that going, too, because they need an address, but.
**Sclevenger**: Yeah.
**Cmortensen**: Okay.
**Cmortensen**: All right.
**Sclevenger**: Sound good.
**Cmortensen**: Anything else?
**Sclevenger**: I'll have a lot more next week once we start construction, but right now I'm just happy to get it going, so.
**Cmortensen**: Okay.
**Cmortensen**: How's the baby doing?
**Sclevenger**: Not doing really well.
**Sclevenger**: Healthy.
**Sclevenger**: Gaining weight, not sleeping the best.
**Sclevenger**: But that's only three weeks old, so.
**Cmortensen**: Yeah.
**Cmortensen**: Yeah.
**Sclevenger**: It's all new and fun, and I can't get enough of them, so I. I bet I'm a workaholic.
**Sclevenger**: Like, I. I enjoy what I do, so I work a lot.
**Cmortensen**: Yeah.
**Sclevenger**: But I'm finding myself wanting to hurry home.
**Cmortensen**: I bet.
**Sclevenger**: During the day.
**Cmortensen**: I bet you do.
**Cmortensen**: You don't want to miss anything and.
**Cmortensen**: Well, that's great to hear, though.
**Cmortensen**: That's great to hear.
**Sclevenger**: She's not.
**Sclevenger**: She's not going back to work.
**Sclevenger**: I don't want her to go.
**Sclevenger**: Have to go back to work.
**Sclevenger**: She doesn't have to go back to work.
**Sclevenger**: She probably will want to, though, eventually.
**Cmortensen**: Yeah.
**Cmortensen**: Yeah.
**Sclevenger**: I feel like I'm missing out a lot.
**Sclevenger**: But it's all good.
**Sclevenger**: It goes so quick.
**Sclevenger**: I can't believe he's already going to be a month old on Saturday.
**Cmortensen**: Oh, my gosh.
**Cmortensen**: Wow.
**Cmortensen**: Well, that's always exciting.
**Cmortensen**: That is always exciting.
**Sclevenger**: So, do you have kids?
**Cmortensen**: You know what?
**Cmortensen**: I do not.
**Cmortensen**: I do not.
**Cmortensen**: But I've been working closely with my brother on a personal construction project, and he has a new grandkid, and it's funny to listen to him the same thing that you do.
**Cmortensen**: I just can't wait to get back up north.
**Cmortensen**: I gotta see it.
**Cmortensen**: And they text you.
**Cmortensen**: They Skype every night and what have you.
**Cmortensen**: So it's fun to listen to all that.
**Cmortensen**: I enjoy listening to it.
**Sclevenger**: That's awesome.
**Sclevenger**: Yeah.
**Sclevenger**: I mean, it's.
**Sclevenger**: I live across the street.
**Sclevenger**: I live in Carmel.
**Sclevenger**: 10 minutes.
**Sclevenger**: 10 minutes from the harvest Market.
**Sclevenger**: But my wife and I bought the house across the street from my.
**Sclevenger**: My parents.
**Sclevenger**: The house I grew up in.
**Sclevenger**: They're, like, always wanting to see him.
**Cmortensen**: You're pretty young, but.
**Cmortensen**: Did you ever watch the show Everybody Loves Raymond?
**Sclevenger**: It's my favorite show.
**Sclevenger**: Yeah?
**Cmortensen**: Is it really?
**Sclevenger**: I call.
**Sclevenger**: I call my mom, Marie.
**Cmortensen**: That's funny.
**Cmortensen**: That's funny.
**Cmortensen**: Well, that.
**Cmortensen**: That will be interesting.
**Cmortensen**: Okay.
**Sclevenger**: I'm the youngest of three boys.
**Sclevenger**: They're they don't.
**Sclevenger**: They don't bother us too much.
**Sclevenger**: They're pretty.
**Cmortensen**: That's good.
**Sclevenger**: They're pretty laid back.
**Cmortensen**: That's good.
**Cmortensen**: That's good.
**Cmortensen**: At least show you a little privacy.
**Sclevenger**: Oh, I go over to their house more than they come to ours.
**Sclevenger**: I'm always good.
**Sclevenger**: Yeah.
**Sclevenger**: Grabbing it.
**Sclevenger**: They got a nice coffee maker there, so I'm always grabbing coffee in the morning.
**Cmortensen**: Oh, okay.
**Cmortensen**: Well, that's great.
**Cmortensen**: You got that relationship, then.
**Cmortensen**: That's great.
**Cmortensen**: Okay.
**Cmortensen**: All right.
**Cmortensen**: Well, there's nothing else.
**Sclevenger**: I'll keep you.
**Sclevenger**: Yep.
**Sclevenger**: I'll keep you updated and we'll.
**Sclevenger**: We'll start plugging along next week.
**Sclevenger**: Okay.
**Cmortensen**: Okay.
**Cmortensen**: Sounds great.
**Cmortensen**: Thank you.
