**Bclymer**: Hey.
**Speaker 1**: Hey.
**Speaker 1**: Good morning.
**Bclymer**: Good morning.
**Speaker 1**: Did you.
**Speaker 1**: Were you able to add us to the license board?
**Speaker 1**: But do we.
**Speaker 1**: I don't think we need to apply again, though.
**Speaker 1**: Everything was sent already.
**Bclymer**: I mean, I.
**Bclymer**: I went in just.
**Bclymer**: And, like, created an account.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, like that.
**Speaker 1**: Like a profile, probably.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: But I.
**Bclymer**: I mean, it's not even.
**Bclymer**: Like I went in.
**Bclymer**: Their website is atrocious.
**Bclymer**: Like, I can't even.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: I mean, the thing is that they told us we.
**Speaker 1**: You need to mail it.
**Speaker 1**: That's what I was like, do we need.
**Speaker 1**: I mean, we can try to fill it out, but everything was sent.
**Bclymer**: Well, I mean, that.
**Bclymer**: That says that they've got it.
**Speaker 1**: So we can check.
**Speaker 1**: So we're going today with Jesse through the Arizona license, finishing today, and then we can check the Georgia one.
**Speaker 1**: I know they have everything on file for us already because they send the email saying that they receive everything, but.
**Speaker 1**: And you know what?
**Speaker 1**: Maybe I'm going to call them, too, because that's what happened with Arizona.
**Speaker 1**: I just called them, and they just helped me right away.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I tried calling.
**Speaker 1**: Nothing.
**Bclymer**: I tried calling Georgia and, I mean.
**Speaker 1**: Couldn'T get through another website.
**Speaker 1**: It's.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I know.
**Speaker 1**: It's not the greatest.
**Bclymer**: All right, well, we'll check.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Let's do credit cards.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.

**Bclymer**: Okay, so here's how I do this.
**Bclymer**: All right?

**Bclymer**: Like, what we'll have to do is, you know, we'll just kind of go through, you know, as we're, you know, as we're getting stuff cleaned up and like, for instance, like, you know, the ChatGPT, the, the Microsoft, all that kind of stuff that we're constantly using, I want to start shifting some of that away from, from my card, like, essentially like going through and like looking at all of our reoccurring charges.
**Bclymer**: And I can be like, okay, we want to keep this or no, we don't need that.
**Bclymer**: You know, and the stuff that we keep, we transfer stuff that we don't want, like, you know, just sign off.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, well, the stuff that we don't want to read, the stuff that we don't want to re up, we will just cancel.

**Speaker 1**: She doesn't Care.
**Speaker 1**: But it's speaking English and she's just like talking, talking, talking.
**Bclymer**: She hears it all the time.
**Speaker 1**: I know.
**Speaker 1**: She's like, it's okay.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, perfect.
**Speaker 1**: And then.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I'm gonna do Arizona now.
**Speaker 1**: So.
**Speaker 1**: Ah, one question to you.
**Speaker 1**: So for the laptop, you want to send it to Florida and let's send that to Jesse.
**Speaker 1**: Correct first, because we cannot send it from the.
**Speaker 1**: Or we can from directly from Best Buy.
**Bclymer**: Well, no, because we.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, we need it set up so.
**Speaker 1**: Exactly.
**Bclymer**: So you can, you can, you can, you can get it here like you can from this Best Buy and then we'll pick it up and have Andrew set it up and then we can mail it directly to Jesse in Arizona.
**Speaker 1**: Perfect.
**Speaker 1**: That was my question.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, so I'll do it right now.
**Speaker 1**: I have everything ready and then I'll just let you know.
**Speaker 1**: So he's have Bluebeam access Job planner access email.
**Speaker 1**: Does he need anything else or something?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I mean Microsoft Project.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Jesse said no procure.
**Speaker 1**: Does he need building connected too?
**Speaker 1**: But that's your.
**Bclymer**: Well, we're, we're looking at different bidding software.
**Bclymer**: So we don't even have a building connected right now.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, sounds good.
**Speaker 1**: Well, actually they replied to me plan help.
**Speaker 1**: They are wondering, I mean they can give us a free trial, but they said that they can give us like a project.
**Speaker 1**: So I mean if we have a project that we need bidding on, they can create a free trial based on that.
**Bclymer**: Okay, well they can do that on the.
**Bclymer**: For the Arizona one.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: So I can let them know that.
**Bclymer**: For Arizona, I guess ask Jesse what.
**Speaker 1**: He thinks and then I remind you now for Job Planner, Kristen said that no, if we want.
**Speaker 1**: For example, the project manager needs to add permission to accounting to create the vendor.
**Speaker 1**: They cannot add members to it.
**Speaker 1**: So they need to ask accounting as well to add members to that account.
**Bclymer**: Is there a way to change.
**Bclymer**: There's actually.
**Bclymer**: Is there a way to change that?
**Speaker 1**: Like so they said no, but I can ask again to Kristen, but can we try to work on these?
**Speaker 1**: You know.
**Bclymer**: But yeah.
**Bclymer**: Was there a way to that we can do a customization to change it.
**Bclymer**: Like.
**Bclymer**: What do you mean?
**Bclymer**: Like, you know.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, I'll ask her.
**Speaker 1**: You know that I have you here.
**Speaker 1**: Don't forget to check Rom, please.
**Speaker 1**: Drum for you.
**Speaker 1**: Your trip with your friends.
**Bclymer**: Oh, Rome.
**Speaker 1**: I want to make sure you have a hotel and a flight to do they respond?
**Speaker 1**: Mike says yes.
**Speaker 1**: And the other, the other guy I think is Mario.
**Speaker 1**: Michael.
**Speaker 1**: There's two mics, right?
**Speaker 1**: Mario.
**Speaker 1**: Mario and Mike.
**Speaker 1**: They said yes.
**Speaker 1**: They like it.
**Speaker 1**: And they already purchased a flight to Rome, so I think it's missing another guy.
**Speaker 1**: I forgot his name.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, Ingmar.
**Bclymer**: What time did the.
**Bclymer**: What flight did they purchase?
**Speaker 1**: The same one as I of yours.
**Speaker 1**: So 4:15.
**Speaker 1**: You're traveling from Croatia to Rome.
**Speaker 1**: It's at 4:15, 4:10.
**Speaker 1**: And you guys are there at 5:15 because it's just super close.
**Speaker 1**: And then you will have dinner at the rooftop of the hotel.
**Speaker 1**: But I need to book your hotel first just to make sure you have a.
**Bclymer**: Book that hotel just for you.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, tell them, hey, we're, you know, I'll.
**Bclymer**: I'll text them too and be like, we're booking this.
**Bclymer**: You know, I'm booking this hotel if you, you know, want to book it as well.
**Speaker 1**: So.
**Speaker 1**: So text them and make.
**Speaker 1**: Just confirm with them everything.
**Speaker 1**: It's fine.
**Speaker 1**: Before I do anything, but I want to make sure you have the hotel and then the flight to Rome to Spain, because you cannot miss that because you have to travel from Barcelona to Pamplona.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: That's the one missing.
**Speaker 1**: So I.
**Speaker 1**: I have that in mind.
**Speaker 1**: And then rider cup sticks are set up.
**Speaker 1**: So that's good.
**Speaker 1**: And then that's it.
**Speaker 1**: I just needed that.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, so once we have Arizona ready submitted, I'll let you know.
**Speaker 1**: But we're finishing right now with Jesse.
**Speaker 1**: Like in 10 minutes, we have a meeting and we'll submit everything.
**Speaker 1**: And then.
**Speaker 1**: I'm glad you did, Georgia.
**Speaker 1**: And then.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, we're just waiting.
**Speaker 1**: That was my question.
**Speaker 1**: We submit everything, so that was weird.
**Speaker 1**: And then I'll finish Capital One too.
**Speaker 1**: And then I'll let you know if anything.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: I just texted those guys.
**Speaker 1**: Perfect.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, confirm with them.
