**Accounting**: Hey, Brandon, here's our open items and accounting that we're working through.
**Accounting**: And here's the status.

**Accounting**: So, you know, right now in that process, confirming a time to meet with revive to walk through it to ensure it works.
**Accounting**: That's one open item, right, that we have a problem.

**Accounting**: Hey, Brandon, here's everything going on in accounting.

**Accounting**: And I'm, you know, on the same page and that we know that there's not something missing because there might be.
**Accounting**: I don't want it to be where I see there's.
**Accounting**: Hey, there's this issue here, and then you guys aren't even tracking it or working on it.
**Justin**: Sorry, guys.
**Justin**: I was a bit late.
**Accounting**: Don't let it happen again ever.
**Accounting**: Fatima, how dare you?
**Fnjie**: We're already done.
**Fnjie**: What do you mean?
**Fnjie**: Bye.
**Justin**: I forgot I got a notification.
**Justin**: Like, shoot.
**Justin**: I had to hop off another.
**Justin**: Another review.
**Accounting**: But hear that, guys?
**Accounting**: We.
**Accounting**: We are like, second thought.
**Justin**: Wow.
**Fnjie**: Never I take that personally.
**Fnjie**: Fatima is here now.
**Justin**: Never.
**Justin**: I spend all my day with you guys.
**Justin**: Everybody else is complaining now.
**Fnjie**: Thank you anyway for time sheets, Brandon.
**Fnjie**: So, yeah, so I know Megan was helping us on that as well.
**Fnjie**: She's actually working on some changes that Fritzi wanted to have as well for the views and everything.
**Fnjie**: So I already follow up with her.
**Fnjie**: She's finishing on that, so I'll keep you posted.
**Fnjie**: But she's working on that.
**Accounting**: One piece of advice I want to give you guys.
**Accounting**: Okay, that helps me immensely.
**Accounting**: So everybody here knows what chat GBT is, correct?
**Accounting**: Does anybody not know it or not ever used it?
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Accounting**: You've never used it, Fritz?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Never use it.
**Accounting**: Okay, so your one thing that I want you to do today is go to chatgpt.com.
**Accounting**: set up a.
**Accounting**: A free personal account and start utilizing.
**Accounting**: So one thing that I do.
**Accounting**: And.
**Accounting**: And I'll.
**Accounting**: And I'll show you this here real quick.
**Accounting**: So you can see this helps me immensely do things.
**Accounting**: So if I look here.
**Accounting**: Okay, so let's see here.
**Accounting**: Wrong one.
**Accounting**: So if I'm.
**Accounting**: If I'm looking here.
**Accounting**: Right?
**Accounting**: Okay, so this is.
**Accounting**: This is chat gbt, right?
**Accounting**: Okay, so if I'm.
**Accounting**: If I'm in chat gbt, and let's say that, like, notion, for instance.
**Accounting**: Okay, like, if we say.
**Accounting**: All right, like, how do we.
**Accounting**: We want to.
**Accounting**: What is it?
**Accounting**: The.
**Accounting**: The timesheets.
**Accounting**: Right?
**Accounting**: That's the issue.
**Justin**: Yes.
**Justin**: I think.
**Justin**: I think Fritzi is trying to get the reports.
**Justin**: The reports formatted to include certain items.
**Justin**: Right, Fritzi?
**Bclymer**: Actually, it's not the report, Fatima.
**Bclymer**: It's how we entered it.
**Bclymer**: Like, how to enter the data.
**Bclymer**: I show her our Excel spreadsheet.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: Okay, so here's.
**Accounting**: So here's what.
**Accounting**: Here's what we'll do.
**Accounting**: So.
**Accounting**: So let me show you.
**Accounting**: This is how I.
**Accounting**: I would start on this problem.
**Accounting**: Where's our.
**Accounting**: You.
**Accounting**: Is it in the chat?
**Accounting**: Is our spreadsheet, Fritzi in the.
**Accounting**: In the account?
**Bclymer**: I.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I sent the link yesterday.
**Accounting**: All right, Time sheet.
**Accounting**: Okay, great.
**Accounting**: Got it.
**Accounting**: All right, so what I would do is if I'm like, okay, I want to figure out how to get.
**Accounting**: Where's this at?
**Accounting**: Not showing.
**Accounting**: It's not showing.
**Accounting**: Can you.
**Accounting**: Can you send me an attachment or something so I can pull this up, show you guys?
**Accounting**: Just send me the attachment or something in the chat.
**Bclymer**: Sure.
**Accounting**: Okay, so here's what I would do.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I sent one attachment in accounting.
**Accounting**: So.
**Accounting**: So I've told it, you know, hey, here's what I want to do, right?
**Accounting**: So here's an example.
**Accounting**: All right, so then all you do is, like, what I will do is I will do a print screen, or you can always upload this document.
**Accounting**: But so I'm gonna, you know.
**Accounting**: You know, I'll print this screen here.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Accounting**: And a lot.
**Accounting**: Again, a lot of times I.
**Accounting**: I will upload the document as well so that it can see it.
**Accounting**: And so now I'm gonna put it in there.
**Accounting**: So now I've uploaded that.
**Accounting**: I said, here's what I'm trying to do.
**Accounting**: Can you help me to do that?
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Accounting**: And now this is going to, you know, tell me, you know, whatever.
**Accounting**: So this is the code, right?
**Accounting**: I could copy and paste it in there, set up viewing.
**Accounting**: Now, see, look, it says, if you'd like, I can even Build Notion database template or give you a shared link to import.
**Accounting**: Want me to set up a nurse table?
**Accounting**: So this is, this is where we talk about, this is how we get better at what we do.
**Accounting**: Now I did all this, I learned code.
**Accounting**: I was literally writing code this weekend for our own AI here at Alito.
**Accounting**: The reason, the way I did that was literally just asking ChatGPT and all these other things, taking screenshots.
**Accounting**: Here's this.
**Accounting**: Copy the code, here's what this says, tell me what to do and it will do it for you.
**Accounting**: And so you can see here how much, how easy this is.
**Accounting**: And when you use this, now I'm using this as this example, but you could use this on Acumatica, you can use it on Job Planner.
**Accounting**: You, you can use it with anything and everything that you do your job and use it as a complete knowledge base to say, how do I do this?
**Accounting**: Right?
**Accounting**: What do I do here?
**Accounting**: And so here, replace the link with the real one, blah, blah, whatever that is.
**Accounting**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: So here's everything we need.
**Accounting**: So there's the, there's the whole thing that you could open, whatever.
**Accounting**: So see how that works?
**Accounting**: Got that Fritz?
**Accounting**: Whoever?
**Accounting**: Anybody.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: That.
**Accounting**: So that's, you know, that's a good tip.
**Accounting**: And again, you just keep working with it, asking it questions, hey, that doesn't work.
**Accounting**: The link doesn't work, blah, blah.
**Accounting**: And just keep talking to it to do it.
**Accounting**: And, and it can walk you through it.
**Accounting**: It's, it's really quite amazing when you, when you start to really use, use stuff like this to help you to do your stuff versus I'm going to email somebody and just wait for them because now you can sit there and do that yourself and in turn build more skills, know how to do it, create more value, get more done, make your life easier.
**Accounting**: So that, that's, that's a big thing that I would do to, to help you.
**Accounting**: And again, even if you don't think of anything where you don't understand, you know, I ask you a question and you don't know what it is.
**Accounting**: Like, hey, my boss is an okay.
**Accounting**: He told me to do xyz and you know, it's, I'm not super clear on what he wants.
**Accounting**: Like, here's exactly what he said.
**Accounting**: You know, I'm, you know, I'm from Mexico.
**Accounting**: Like Spanish is my first language or I'm from Philippines and Filipinos my first language.
**Accounting**: Can you recreate this and tell me what he's asking in my native language so I understand it?
**Accounting**: Like you can be Very descriptive to have it help you to do that, like, so that you know exactly what's going on.
**Accounting**: Because that way you can eliminate that language barrier and you're like, oh, shit.
**Accounting**: I think this is what he wants.
**Accounting**: Well, you can just ask it and just tell it.
**Accounting**: Here's what the issue is.
**Justin**: It is.
**Justin**: It is pretty neat.
**Justin**: I've been using it lately more often than I did before and it's.
**Justin**: It's pretty crazy what it can do.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Accounting**: But like right there, it looks like it's telling you exactly how to do it in notion to create this thing, to make it work.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Justin**: I never thought about it for the Akumatica thing we've been having because it seems like Ashley really doesn't understand what we are needing.
**Justin**: So, Jose, maybe, you know, you can give it a shot or maybe we can try it out.
**Justin**: I can try it when I.
**Justin**: When I get a minute to get that result.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: I mean, that's.
**Accounting**: That's how I.
**Accounting**: I would teach myself.
**Accounting**: Acumatica is literally like, all right, here it is.
**Accounting**: And I take a screenshot of what I'm looking at and maybe I take several screenshots and be like, here you go.
**Accounting**: Like, what do I do?
**Accounting**: What does this mean?
**Accounting**: I understand, like 100%.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: All right, Cool.
**Accounting**: All right, well, that's enough for climbers.
**Accounting**: Coaching corner.
**Accounting**: Anything else?
**Justin**: As far as.
**Justin**: I don't.
**Justin**: I didn't.
**Justin**: I don't know if Ashley scheduled a meeting, but I think if she can't resolve, I think I know what to do.
**Justin**: You know, to figure it out moving forward.
**Justin**: We just have to separate job plan upload versus, you know, the Proco upload, where we use a project as a project task for this one and use the job number as a project task for this one and just kind of upload it that way.
**Justin**: Two separate uploads.
**Justin**: That's the easiest thing I could think of.
**Accounting**: Yeah, definitely.
**Accounting**: You could definitely filter your.
**Accounting**: Your notion spreadsheets by.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: Procore or Job Point or Johnson and Procore Spacing out anyway.
**Accounting**: Right.
**Accounting**: There shouldn't be a ton of stuff.
**Accounting**: I mean, create Escapes is done like Bart is done.
**Accounting**: I mean, really, there's not anything else that's going to be running out of there.
**Justin**: Yeah, yeah.
**Justin**: About the jobs, I was going to ask you, when.
**Justin**: When a job is phasing out, is there anything the project team does with the subs to make sure that all the invoices are paid out, nothing gets missed?
**Justin**: Just to avoid an invoice, you know, hitting six months after the Job close.
**Accounting**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: I mean, as far as subcontractors, like, the biggest thing is, you know, you can see their commitment.
**Accounting**: It should be, you know, fully paid out.
**Accounting**: Zero.
**Accounting**: And we've released.
**Accounting**: Retaining like that is part of that because we're going to get warranties from them.
**Accounting**: They're not going to give us that warranty unless they've been paid.
**Accounting**: So you got to have the warranty information for closeout.
**Accounting**: As far as vendors go, again, like most that stuff, I mean, you're talking like toilets and dumpsters and.
**Accounting**: And typical things like that.
**Accounting**: Most of that should be pretty concurrent.
**Accounting**: Right.
**Accounting**: Because by the time that we're demobilizing and we're doing closeout, that takes a month to two.
**Accounting**: And so we should have those cost.
**Accounting**: You know, I.
**Accounting**: If I don't have an answer for you, how can we prevent that something hitting later from a vendor if for some reason they missed it, besides just trying to follow up and.
**Accounting**: No, but.
**Accounting**: Yeah, I don't know a great way to prevent that.
**Accounting**: All right.
**Justin**: I know Crate Escapes is a crazy, crazy job that is ending.
**Justin**: So I'm sure we'll be getting hit with all, all kinds of stuff.
**Accounting**: But.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: All right.
**Bclymer**: And also, Fatima, I have one pending items with job planner with.
**Bclymer**: Relates to the.
**Bclymer**: The commitments.
**Justin**: Oh, yes, yes.
**Bclymer**: Oh, yeah.
**Bclymer**: There's an email ongoing.
**Bclymer**: So I asked them if we have a call today so that we can figure we can close that one out.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Justin**: All right.
**Justin**: Yeah, I.
**Justin**: I saw your email this morning.
**Justin**: I'll look at it after.
**Justin**: After this call.
**Accounting**: Let's make sure that we have any open issues.
**Accounting**: It's in notion in a tracker table and in account in the accounting section.
**Accounting**: You know, we should have a tracker for what the problem is and then the person who's handling it, the assignee.
**Accounting**: So, like the task thing, Jose, that's assigned to you, you know, Fatima or Fritz, the thing that you just mentioned that would be assigned to you.
**Accounting**: Like, everybody you know should know who's in charge of that and what the next steps are, where that's at, the process.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Accounting**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: Did you follow up with McCombs for the audit?
**Accounting**: I already sent it.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Accounting**: Yeah, I already sent it to him.
**Justin**: Yeah, he sent it this morning.
**Justin**: And it looks like we are done with the audit.
**Justin**: So just have.
**Justin**: Yeah, I know.
**Justin**: I just have to look at the financials, make to see if everything looks off, but it should be pretty good.
**Justin**: So I'll respond to EAD here shortly.
**Accounting**: All right, Sounds good.
**Accounting**: All right, thanks, guys.
**Justin**: All right.
**Jdawson**: Thank you, thank you, thank you okay?
