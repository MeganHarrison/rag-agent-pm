## Transcript
**Ataylor**: Sam, J.D.
**Ataylor**: you there?
**Ataylor**: Jesse.
**Bclymer**: You ready to get going?
**Ataylor**: Yep.
**Ataylor**: So, you know, one thing, you know, for, you know, what we've been doing is kind of going through and you know, Maria has been, you know, typing and asking things.
**Ataylor**: But what I want to do moving forward is we go in and every time that it gets to a project that is somebody's responsibility.
**Ataylor**: So you know, like, you know, Bloomington, like Nick, you're going to give us.
**Ataylor**: Here's what's going on, here's the important things.
**Ataylor**: And you need to be filling out any and all tasks on there, not just Maria sitting there taking notes.
**Ataylor**: So everybody who's got their responsibility on whatever it is that their project and stuff is, should be speaking and typing and filling that stuff in.
**Ataylor**: You know, Maria can share her screen, you know, so that we have one person sharing the screen and following along.
**Ataylor**: But as you get to you, that person should be briefing.
**Ataylor**: Briefing.
**Ataylor**: Cool.
**Gducharme**: Okay, let's do this.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So we have the fire marshal final on.
**Jdawson**: On Wednesday at 9am Cannon's gonna fly down there and then assuming we pass that, which we, we shouldn't have an issue with tying in that fire alarm tomorrow we will apply for a tco.
**Jdawson**: I flew down last week to meet with the fire marshal to make sure we can get a TCO with not having an official fire alarm permit.
**Jdawson**: And he said that's okay because it's one tamper and flow switch and yeah, dodged a bullet with that one.
**Jdawson**: So as soon as we get that actual permit and it gets processed through the Excelis system, Dallas has a new system, then we'll be able to close the permit out.
**Jdawson**: But we're, we're all good for a go live on 8 11.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: And then as far as closeout docs, where you at on that?
**Jdawson**: I have not started any closeout docs.
**Jdawson**: Yep, I build 98.5 on everything.
**Jdawson**: I'll get going on close out documents here.
**Jdawson**: Okay, we got a little work.
**Jdawson**: I gotta pick your brain, Brandon, on what we do with this.
**Jdawson**: Did we do fire alarm for the OPEX in Greenwood?
**Jdawson**: Because no one knows and it's in our scope.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, I think deemed it.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Well, I'm half tempted to call our friend Jared Richie and see exactly what we did or go down there and.
**Ataylor**: Look, he's not gonna remember.
**Jdawson**: I don't.
**Jdawson**: I mean I.
**Ataylor**: Do you remember like what, what we did?
**Jdawson**: Like so there's nowhere to tie in the control panels for the OPEX system.
**Jdawson**: They have four control panels, one for each aisle or six.
**Jdawson**: There's nowhere to tie in what.
**Jdawson**: What you have to do is tie into, like, a shunt trip breaker, right?
**Jdawson**: There's no shunt trip breaker in the box there.
**Jdawson**: So is it up to us to pick up that breaker?
**Jdawson**: Because Ulta's electricians are the ones who tied in the control panels.
**Ataylor**: I mean, no, we just run the wire, you know, to.
**Ataylor**: To get landed.
**Bclymer**: So let's see here.
**Jdawson**: And then someone.
**Jdawson**: Someone else lands it?
**Ataylor**: Typically, yeah.
**Ataylor**: We don't touch.
**Ataylor**: We don't open the panel.
**Ataylor**: So they're like.
**Ataylor**: Like whenever we did it in Greenwood, the.
**Ataylor**: Whoever did the electrical work on the control panel is the one that landed it.
**Jdawson**: Okay, well, then that's.
**Jdawson**: That provides some good clarity.
**Jdawson**: Because if it's as easy as just running the wire, I mean, we'll get that knocked out, no problem.
**Ataylor**: Did we not do fire alarm inside the PIC mod down in Dallas?
**Jdawson**: No, there is no fire alarm in there.
**Jdawson**: It's all existing.
**Ataylor**: All right.
**Ataylor**: Because we did it in Greenwood.
**Ataylor**: Because I'm looking at the firearm drawings.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, it's a different setup.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: All of our lines we added down the center of those aisles.
**Jdawson**: We just.
**Jdawson**: We're able to tie into the existing system.
**Ataylor**: Gotcha.
**Gducharme**: So.
**Jdawson**: Okay, that helps.
**Jdawson**: I'll look into it.
**Jdawson**: It's not critical to get in our final, but it's in our scope, and they want us to do the dramatic now, so I owe him a change order for that.
**Ataylor**: What do you mean?
**Ataylor**: Do the Mac.
**Ataylor**: Do the sprinkler for the dramatic?
**Jdawson**: No, do the fire alarm port.
**Ataylor**: Gotcha.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: I mean, yeah, we didn't land it because we don't.
**Ataylor**: We don't.
**Ataylor**: We wouldn't touch the panel.
**Ataylor**: We ran a relay to it.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: But.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, I mean, that's.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: What else?
**Ataylor**: Anything?
**Jdawson**: No, that's it.
**Gducharme**: Right?
**Gducharme**: Sk.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we got paid in full for that.
**Jdawson**: I met with Rick today.
**Jdawson**: The city wants us to clean up some cracks in the concrete, so I got CC Meet me out there tomorrow for them.
**Jdawson**: And apparently, Glenn, something to look into.
**Jdawson**: I'm not sure exactly what the inspector meant by it, but anything that you do in Westfield's right of way, they make you maintain for the first three years.
**Jdawson**: And I look everywhere to see where we sign that or where that information says.
**Jdawson**: And I'm.
**Jdawson**: I think it's a new thing they passed within the last year, so I would.
**Jdawson**: I would.
**Jdawson**: I would look into it for Collective.
**Jdawson**: And then after the three year mark, we're.
**Kmass**: What does that entail?
**Kmass**: Snow removal or.
**Ataylor**: Or.
**Jdawson**: I. I asked him.
**Jdawson**: I think it's just maintaining, like, any sidewalks you put in.
**Jdawson**: Because that's what we're running into now.
**Jdawson**: Because I went back and looked at photos and like one of the cracks happened in the last couple weeks.
**Jdawson**: He's like, yeah, make sure you, you know when you're out here, you epoxy that crack.
**Bclymer**: I'm like, geez.
**Jdawson**: So we have to route it out and then put some sort of filler in it.
**Kmass**: What is this like the concrete around the sidewalk around there?
**Kmass**: Is this not on site concrete?
**Kmass**: Right, because you did a perimeter trail asphalt.
**Jdawson**: No, yeah, this is, this is right away concrete.
**Ataylor**: Okay, yeah.
**Jdawson**: So like that we, we.
**Kmass**: Okay, yeah, I got a little bit of that.
**Ataylor**: But.
**Bclymer**: Well, it's very important.
**Bclymer**: Like when you start a job that involves site work and streets and all that, you take very dated, detailed photos of everything around you and your site so the city doesn't come back and make you fix some shit that was already broke.
**Jdawson**: Right, Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I was able to get out of, at the end of the road there they the end of Carousel Lane.
**Jdawson**: He was saying he was going to have me tear out like a, a, a curb and replace it, but I was like, dude, that's clearly your snowplow guys.
**Jdawson**: And thankfully I had some photos to show him, but then there's another situation where I don't.
**Ataylor**: So when is that going to get fixed so that we can close it?
**Jdawson**: I'm meeting with CC tomorrow to show them the spots.
**Jdawson**: They're marked in spray paint and we'll get them out there ASAP this week and work them in.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: Okay, next one.
**Gducharme**: Goodwill Bar.
**Gducharme**: This is Nick.
**Njepson**: Okay, something that came up last week is the vestibule door is not latching properly.
**Njepson**: So Glenmark was supposed to be on site this afternoon to fix that.
**Njepson**: And I'll follow up with him.
**Njepson**: But according to the AR aging report, we did get the final payment.
**Ataylor**: Okay, what about close that docs?
**Njepson**: Yeah, those are all turned in.
**Ataylor**: Perfect.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: Aspire, Nipple, Richie.
**Gducharme**: Nick.
**Njepson**: This job, we've been paid about half.
**Njepson**: We're still waiting on the other payments.
**Bclymer**: Nick.
**Bclymer**: I tried calling Ben and Ronnie both today, didn't get him to answer.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: Okay, next one.
**Gducharme**: Goodwill Bloomington.
**Njepson**: This is Nick Bloomington.
**Njepson**: I sent the owners awning proposal and they're asking to see a different style awning, so I'm getting pricing on that.
**Njepson**: And then also utility vaults, we're still waiting for approval on that.
**Njepson**: And also the paint design, Goodwill is working on that.
**Gducharme**: Okay, thank you, Nick.
**Gducharme**: Sima Consulting.
**Gducharme**: This is Alec.
**Fireflies**: Yep, I talked to Rob Ramsey today.
**Fireflies**: He's the person who turned in our drawings for a permit to the township for that change order added work.
**Fireflies**: No response yet from him.
**Fireflies**: Thinking about just calling the township myself because he's not the most responsible guy, unfortunately.
**Fireflies**: He did tell me this morning though, to expect our material for that work earlier this week.
**Ataylor**: Okay, and so are they going to go ahead and get started or are just going to wait.
**Fireflies**: As soon as we get the draw?
**Fireflies**: I think when the drawings come back with permit, I can touch base with you guys and the GC as soon as they're ready to go on site.
**Ataylor**: But.
**Fireflies**: I don't see any reason why we'd be held up.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: All right.
**Ataylor**: Make sure you go in and update notion appropriately, please.
**Fireflies**: Is there.
**Gducharme**: Nick Goodwill office curb cut?
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: Fritz Engineering said they.
**Njepson**: They should have our revised drawings review by the end of this week.
**Ataylor**: Hopefully it finally gets approved.
**Gducharme**: Okay, thank you, Nick Glenn.
**Gducharme**: Westfield Collective.
**Kmass**: Westfield Collective.
**Kmass**: I got the wrong job up, so.
**Bclymer**: I did will up.
**Kmass**: Westfield Collective is waiting on H Vac conversation.
**Kmass**: Brandon, I don't know if you met with H Vac again today yet, but we did a ward cns, the prod.
**Kmass**: The H VAC moving forward.
**Kmass**: They're still working on getting pricing from the mechanical screens.
**Kmass**: We did get pricing from another contractor for mechanical screens, which was.
**Ataylor**: And you said you ordered cns.
**Ataylor**: What's that mean?
**Kmass**: I mean, you said that he said he was.
**Kmass**: He was the lower one and we're going with him.
**Kmass**: So I just sent him an LOI to let him know that I sent him an email, let him know, hey, this is your letter of intent that.
**Kmass**: That we are going to hire you and to go ahead and move forward with the rest of the pricing.
**Kmass**: He wasn't pricing up anything else until he knew if he was going to win the job or not.
**Kmass**: So getting the mechanical screen pricing from him.
**Ataylor**: I told you to do that.
**Ataylor**: I told you to sit because I told you that he was low and we're gonna go with him.
**Ataylor**: But I don't remember telling you to release him.
**Kmass**: I haven't released him on anything.
**Kmass**: I just let him know that he.
**Kmass**: He had won based on the numbers after what we talked about on what, Thursday or Friday.
**Ataylor**: So you're.
**Ataylor**: Did you release anything?
**Kmass**: No, not.
**Kmass**: I have not released him to.
**Kmass**: To purchase or.
**Kmass**: Or buy anything.
**Kmass**: I haven't given him a subcontract yet.
**Kmass**: I just let him know that he.
**Kmass**: That he won.
**Kmass**: That way he would move forward with pricing the rest of the mechanical screens for us.
**Kmass**: I. I don't have any answer to release him on.
**Kmass**: As far as you know, the RTUS goes, so I don't have any information to give him yet on that.
**Kmass**: The rest of the stuff is pretty readily available.
**Kmass**: So I'm just waiting on, waiting to find out what, you know, what comes up.
**Ataylor**: So you're, you're, you're positive if on Wednesday, Fight president comes back to me, she says, hey, we're just going to complete the contract, then we aren't on the hook for any cost from cns?
**Kmass**: No, I, no, I haven't given them anything to do besides write up more, give me more estimates for, for mechanical screens.
**Kmass**: That's all he's, that's all he's doing.
**Kmass**: That's all I released him on again because he didn't want to give us any more pricing and keep working on bidding since he hadn't heard from us in three weeks.
**Kmass**: So I told him he was low, he was going to win and go ahead and keep pricing the mechanical screens and I'll write him a subcontract when you finish up with what you're doing with, with fight.
**Bclymer**: But again, if she comes to the table Wednesday and said, I am going to finish it, is he going to want some money for doing more pre construction and estimating since he didn't want to do it without a contract?
**Kmass**: Yeah, he didn't want to.
**Kmass**: He didn't want to keep pricing the screens out unless he knew he was getting the job.
**Kmass**: And after what was told the other day, I was under the impression he was getting the job because he was the lower, the lower bid after, after your conversation with Erica.
**Ataylor**: So let me try to rephrase the question again.
**Ataylor**: Maybe you didn't understand it.
**Ataylor**: So if Erica comes back and says, I'm going to complete the contract as is.
**Kmass**: I didn't commit any cost to him.
**Kmass**: I don't, I don't know.
**Kmass**: I don't know how else to say that.
**Kmass**: I didn't give him a contract.
**Kmass**: I didn't commit any cost to him.
**Ataylor**: But you told him we were going to issue him the contract, correct?
**Kmass**: I did tell him that he was a little bit.
**Kmass**: And that he would, he would be winning the contract.
**Kmass**: I didn't realize that you were still giving Erica the chance to.
**Ataylor**: I mean, legally we have to.
**Ataylor**: Like, legally we have to.
**Ataylor**: That's how these contracts work.
**Kmass**: So until which point?
**Kmass**: Until like at what point?
**Ataylor**: Until we officially put her on notice and she defaults.
**Ataylor**: Which is what I went over with you last week when you were asking how does this work?
**Kmass**: Yeah, well, I understand that part, but we still have to get the next guy going and if we have to wait till the RTUs and then give her, put her on notice, and that takes I don't know how weeks or a month or whatever to.
**Kmass**: For her to respond, then what is that?
**Kmass**: Oh, it's just two days.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, for.
**Ataylor**: You should read the contract.
**Ataylor**: See, I mean, I feel like I'm.
**Jdawson**: Talking to a wall here.
**Ataylor**: Do you?
**Ataylor**: I mean, what are your concerns with this?
**Bclymer**: You talk referencing me, Brandon?
**Ataylor**: Yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: It's simply.
**Bclymer**: All I'm saying is the guy, he's like, I don't want to do any more work unless I know I'm going to get the job.
**Bclymer**: So now we told him he's going to get the job, and if she comes back and says, well, we're going to finish it, then we would tell him, no, you're not going to get the job.
**Bclymer**: And he will say, well, I spent another thousand dollars bidding it or whatever.
**Bclymer**: That's all.
**Bclymer**: It just should have been like more clear to him that, like, hey, we got a meeting Wednesday to finalize.
**Ataylor**: Our.
**Bclymer**: Situation with this current contractor.
**Bclymer**: So I would have waited till Wednesday, but I would have given him a call and told him, hey, you were the low guy.
**Bclymer**: We got a meeting Wednesday.
**Bclymer**: We'll put this sub in default, and if we do that, we will bring you on board.
**Bclymer**: We'll understand fully the situation with the RTUs, whether we're going to have to get those somewhere else or not at that point.
**Bclymer**: And then we can release you at least.
**Bclymer**: And maybe you tell the guy that I worked with him quite a bit.
**Bclymer**: He might have been like, okay, well start working on that.
**Bclymer**: Anyways, it's just when you tell someone something like that and it can change, that's not good.
**Ataylor**: He has no idea that he might not get the contract is what we're saying.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: It's like me telling you, hey, I'm going to give you a raise.
**Ataylor**: But in reality, it's a maybe.
**Bclymer**: Typically, like an loi, you have to cap the amount.
**Bclymer**: Like when you give someone an loi, that's basically a contract where they can come back at you and tell you whatever time they spend after that notice is given is worth so many dollars.
**Bclymer**: So typically you want to cap that at this is no more than $10,000, but please proceed just to protect ourselves so this guy doesn't cancel three other jobs he would have taken when this job's supposed to start, and then he blames us for that too.
**Bclymer**: You know, it just can be bad.
**Ataylor**: Yep.
**Kmass**: I thought we were meeting today at 1 as well.
**Kmass**: So when I released him on Friday.
**Kmass**: He wasn't going to have much.
**Kmass**: He wasn't going to get very far.
**Ataylor**: She emailed me this morning, said, hey, we're working with a couple contractors to see if we can finish this out.
**Ataylor**: Can we move it to Wednesday?
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: Okay, thank you.
**Gducharme**: Glenn Cormagia, Exotech, this is Alec.
**Ataylor**: Yep.
**Fireflies**: So I've been in contact with super Arco and our guy Jeff at Seven Hills.
**Fireflies**: We had our inspection last Friday and it looks like everything went according to.
**Fireflies**: Everything went fine.
**Fireflies**: I reviewed Brandon a little bit.
**Fireflies**: There was some miscommunication with the fire suppression people on site and went ahead and put that chain wheel in for us.
**Fireflies**: And ARCO told us to go ahead and return the material.
**Fireflies**: Still working with Seven Hills to figure out what the restock and shipping fees were, but I'll get a number for that here soon.
**Fireflies**: And I'm waiting on documentation from Arco and I also left a message for the fire marshal in the area to show that we passed the inspection.
**Ataylor**: So.
**Gducharme**: Thank you, Alec.
**Gducharme**: Don't forget to update those as well.
**Gducharme**: Aspires and Lucy, thank you, Nick.
**Njepson**: We're waiting on payments for that job.
**Ataylor**: We already have our co docs done.
**Gducharme**: We.
**Njepson**: I suppose I. I could get a workmanship warranty from the.
**Njepson**: The contractor.
**Ataylor**: Yep.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Make sure you have everything turned in on all of them Aspire jobs.
**Bclymer**: We're badgering them for payment, so I don't want them saying, well, now where's our closeout documents either.
**Ataylor**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Plus you can show that we're continuing to work on the job, so.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: Newman Holding.
**Gducharme**: Paraxis says.
**Gducharme**: Aj.
**Ataylor**: You'Re muted.
**Jdawson**: Aj, can you hear me now?
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: We received the permit last week.
**Jdawson**: Framing's completed.
**Jdawson**: Eight subcontractors in there today, so it's getting a little tight, but we're working through it.
**Jdawson**: Overhead should actually be done this week, if not early next week, and we should be able to start jit board.
**Jdawson**: It's just a matter of getting that ceiling in.
**Jdawson**: And we got the RTU curb set.
**Jdawson**: All the steel is complete as of today.
**Jdawson**: That one's.
**Jdawson**: That one's moving pretty quickly.
**Jdawson**: So I. I received concrete pricing.
**Ataylor**: On.
**Jdawson**: Friday and so I need to get that contract writ and get that front that.
**Jdawson**: That change on the ADLS amendment for the front entrance.
**Jdawson**: They're making me put limestone lentils in, so we'll probably have to pull from contingency for that if I can't get it bought out for the same price.
**Jdawson**: So I'm waiting on pricing from.
**Jdawson**: From Hensel, who I had Already issued an LOI to and we'll see how that goes.
**Jdawson**: But I should have those out the door today.
**Jdawson**: If not, first thing in the morning.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: Denver Theater.
**Gducharme**: A.J.
**Ataylor**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: I got a W9 from Bill.
**Jdawson**: We'll get them input in the system and send them.
**Jdawson**: Send a bill out to them.
**Jdawson**: Stopped by earlier today.
**Jdawson**: We're finishing drywall.
**Jdawson**: I just have one contractor doing it.
**Jdawson**: My jack of all trades, Andreas.
**Ataylor**: So.
**Jdawson**: I've been.
**Jdawson**: I've been emailing with him back and forth.
**Jdawson**: I need him to confirm this budget and.
**Jdawson**: And he'll.
**Jdawson**: He'll be able to do it for that, but he.
**Jdawson**: He's at least committed to getting all the drywall finished and paint.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: Apply engineer office remodel.
**Gducharme**: AJ.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So the two big things on my list for that were to get this VAV schedule figured out, which we got some answers in our meeting today, our weekly meeting with.
**Jdawson**: With the client.
**Jdawson**: I owe a change order for an added door and our kitchen island to the subs.
**Jdawson**: It's already been issued from Applied.
**Jdawson**: See, as far as on site, we're going to build a temp wall.
**Jdawson**: Just too hard to tie in that ceiling with the current setup we have.
**Jdawson**: So we did get approval to start that on Wednesday.
**Jdawson**: So we'll build that temp wall to the underside of the cloud and then be able to finish the project up without bothering them too much.
**Jdawson**: Can finish up the electrical tomorrow and then we'll begin our VAV install next week.
**Gducharme**: Thank you.
**Gducharme**: Az Seminole Collective, Jesse.
**Bclymer**: They'Re still reviewing a contract.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: So nothing yet.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: For Collective.
**Ataylor**: Jesse Ramirez were collected for me.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, we got the budget finished.
**Ataylor**: Oh yeah, I. I messaged you guys with trying to find which one is the correct proposal.
**Ataylor**: I was looking in the five.
**Ataylor**: Is it 20?
**Ataylor**: It's only 25 million, is that right?
**Bclymer**: So we had.
**Bclymer**: For the hotel.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: What about the other.
**Ataylor**: I mean, the whole.
**Bclymer**: It's 14 million for the.
**Ataylor**: So you have two different estimates.
**Ataylor**: One the hotel and one for the other side.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Fireflies**: The other one's called the complex.
**Bclymer**: Collective complex.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: Goodwill Tremond, this is Nick.
**Bclymer**: You emailed that, didn't you?
**Bclymer**: You emailed those to Brandon, Both of them?
**Ataylor**: Yeah, it's in PDFs.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: You should have got it should be in an email.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: I was in the file in my email too.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: Nick.
**Njepson**: Tremont.
**Njepson**: I have a walkthrough with the architect and possibly Dean on Wednesday and then we're going to start the design.
**Njepson**: And we also need to determine which contractors are going to be hired by Goodwill.
**Njepson**: And which ones we're hiring.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: Keva, Uniqlo, New Jersey.
**Jmendez**: Yes.
**Jmendez**: We just had a meeting about the sprinklers.
**Jmendez**: They're changing some of the racking system, so we are going to send them a chain order for that.
**Ataylor**: So a task that you need to make.
**Ataylor**: Kevin, get pricing on added level.
**Jmendez**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, we're gonna ask for like two weeks extra time.
**Ataylor**: Oh, we're definitely gonna.
**Ataylor**: We're gonna definitely ask for some time.
**Ataylor**: All right.
**Jmendez**: And on site we are still doing electrical work.
**Jmendez**: We have the plumber formed up concrete today and I have a RFI open for the concrete finish in the bathrooms.
**Jmendez**: So we have.
**Ataylor**: Did you call the architect about that?
**Jmendez**: I did, yes, I did.
**Jmendez**: And after the call, he.
**Jmendez**: He sent out an email to uck asking for that.
**Jmendez**: The specification for that finish.
**Ataylor**: And.
**Ataylor**: Huh.
**Ataylor**: Did they pour today?
**Jmendez**: No, they're not poor.
**Jmendez**: They basically tying the rebars today and they're going to Portimore.
**Ataylor**: And you told the architect that they're going to pour tomorrow?
**Ataylor**: Yep.
**Jmendez**: And.
**Ataylor**: We already get a plumbing inspection?
**Jmendez**: We did, yes.
**Jmendez**: So there was one issue with the tag on the pipe.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, the rice, the vent.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: What about.
**Ataylor**: Do we know if there has to be any inspection for that concrete being reinforced?
**Jmendez**: I don't think so.
**Jmendez**: As.
**Jmendez**: As far as the inspector.
**Jmendez**: The inspector was concerned, the only thing he has left was the tag.
**Jmendez**: And we sent him a tag, but he.
**Jmendez**: He wants it to see the oil and water separator.
**Jmendez**: So Chris was supposed to return with that today, but Mike just informed me that he's coming tomorrow instead.
**Jmendez**: So the inspector just wanted a picture to confirm.
**Ataylor**: Is the plumbing inspector the same as everything else?
**Ataylor**: Is there just one inspector?
**Jmendez**: Just one inspector.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Yep.
**Jmendez**: I did start a change order for the sprinkler stuff, but obviously going to change.
**Jmendez**: So I'll get some pricing and adjust the schedule to add the two extra weeks.
**Ataylor**: Well, I mean, you're not going to do it yet, right?
**Jmendez**: I think that's it for Unicorn now.
**Gducharme**: Thank you, Kevin.
**Gducharme**: AJ Memphis calls to rush phase two.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Nothing really.
**Jdawson**: I'm not sure where we're at on.
**Kmass**: The.
**Jdawson**: PO side of things or when they'll pay that invoice.
**Jdawson**: I know we got an email saying they will.
**Ataylor**: Well, did he say that or you say he submitted it?
**Jdawson**: He said he submitted it.
**Bclymer**: I guess.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: I don't know.
**Jdawson**: What do you.
**Jdawson**: I know I'm going to.
**Jdawson**: I'm going to go through and basically delete the whole budget and just change it to just the design that we submitted.
**Jdawson**: That way it doesn't show us like an $8 million project out there.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: Yep.
**Ataylor**: Be $150,000 loss.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I can't wait for that one, that one to hit.
**Ataylor**: It's already hit.
**Gducharme**: Glenn Goodwill Foundations.
**Kmass**: We got polished concrete going on finishing up tomorrow.
**Kmass**: We'll get the electricals finished up on Wednesday and Thursday.
**Kmass**: Final paint and set the cabinets, the brackets, and then we will get a final clean later.
**Kmass**: So we can do turnover cabinets or.
**Kmass**: Sorry.
**Kmass**: The countertop measured.
**Kmass**: They decided to upgrade to a quartz.
**Kmass**: So we'll get those field measured after the brackets are in on the wall, probably Thursday.
**Kmass**: And Those are about 10 days out once we order those.
**Kmass**: And they'll come and put those in.
**Kmass**: But we have build and invoice for everything as of now for this.
**Kmass**: For this project.
**Bclymer**: Besides, like you build 100%.
**Bclymer**: But we're still working in August.
**Ataylor**: Is that.
**Bclymer**: Typically you need to be done before you bill 100 for a job?
**Kmass**: Yeah, I just.
**Kmass**: I just got my billing.
**Kmass**: My billing done.
**Kmass**: And Andrew knew that change order was coming for this, for this thing, for the counters that are coming in.
**Ataylor**: So you build for the base.
**Ataylor**: You build 100 for the base.
**Ataylor**: Yep.
**Ataylor**: Gotcha.
**Bclymer**: But we're still polishing floors.
**Bclymer**: That's my only question.
**Kmass**: Yeah, yeah, we'll be done.
**Kmass**: We'll be done with all the rest of the stuff this week.
**Kmass**: The answer is no.
**Kmass**: I did not drag out.
**Kmass**: I did not carry the billing in August through the end of August.
**Kmass**: Since we were wrapping up this week.
**Ataylor**: I just.
**Kmass**: I just pushed it all through.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: Radial Martinsville.
**Jdawson**: We got no update on this one.
**Ataylor**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: They don't know what they want to do.
**Jdawson**: And we talk about Godiva later down the road or down the list.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: Gpc Harrisburg, Alec.
**Ataylor**: Yep.
**Fireflies**: So for gpc, we have the static racking drawings in Fablesst.
**Fireflies**: Those been received.
**Fireflies**: Undergoing design review right now for the ASRs system.
**Fireflies**: And I have a call scheduled tomorrow with Adelphia.
**Fireflies**: I touched base with Jesse from there today about their pricing on Manpower.
**Fireflies**: He's been out of the office.
**Fireflies**: I think he's on pto, which is why he hasn't gotten back to me.
**Fireflies**: But he said that he'll be in tomorrow morning.
**Fireflies**: We'll take a look at what I sent him first thing and then we'll review in the morning if he has any questions.
**Ataylor**: So you need to add on there.
**Ataylor**: You need to add a task for yourself to get in contact with FM Global over that building.
**Ataylor**: So you'll have to play a lot of phone tag to figure that out.
**Ataylor**: Yep.
**Gducharme**: Ag Cramdale.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So we're gonna try and put stone down tomorrow on the path.
**Jdawson**: Obviously with the rain.
**Jdawson**: Thursday set us back a little because we just stripped the topsoil but everything checks out today.
**Jdawson**: I swung by this morning and then my papers were just out there.
**Bclymer**: This.
**Jdawson**: Afternoon and we're gonna go for it.
**Jdawson**: We're running into crossroads meeting us out there when we start slinging the stone.
**Jdawson**: But where old gas crosses under where we meet the new, I wouldn't say old gas, existing gas crosses under the path where we have to connect the old path with the new path.
**Jdawson**: And it seems to be a little soft there.
**Jdawson**: So I'm going to see what they want us to do.
**Jdawson**: But depending on what they suggest, you know it's going to be a change order decorum.
**Ataylor**: When's that thing supposed to be done?
**Jdawson**: When's what?
**Ataylor**: When's that supposed to be done?
**Jdawson**: Well, the path further zoning letter was supposed to be done last week by 8:1.
**Jdawson**: Obviously with the rain like caramel.
**Jdawson**: Carmel's all good with us working with crossroads to get it done here.
**Jdawson**: But soon when we start slinging stone tomorrow it's going to be tomorrow.
**Jdawson**: Stone goes down and then paving Wednesday and we're done.
**Jdawson**: So we're done with everything on the inside build for all a little bit ago.
**Jdawson**: So we'll.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we should have it wrapped up hopefully this week.
**Jdawson**: I looked at the forecast.
**Jdawson**: It looks like we have a little, little rain in the forecast tonight.
**Jdawson**: So we'll have to play it by ear tomorrow.
**Gducharme**: Okay, thank you.
**Gducharme**: Aj Kevo Radal Avon.
**Jdawson**: So that one is both me and Cabo.
**Jdawson**: We're getting the final levelers installed this week.
**Jdawson**: We have 12 on the outbound side and five left to do on the inbound side.
**Jdawson**: We poured those Wednesday, Thursday, last week.
**Jdawson**: So we're set to have it should cure up by this Wednesday and then we'll get all the levelers and the final restraints installed.
**Jdawson**: All the power is going to be done to them probably Wednesday and then we'll.
**Jdawson**: We'll have to hook them up once the restraints get installed.
**Jdawson**: So I would, I would think power is going to be done into next week as far as having all of them up and running and then we'll start.
**Jdawson**: JP's pushing to get the, the seals installed like tomorrow.
**Jdawson**: I let them know a couple weeks ago that we would like to get them all done at once because a couple guys will come in, just knock them out.
**Jdawson**: He's asking if I can't move that up.
**Jdawson**: So we'll see.
**Jdawson**: We'll See if I can't get Kurt out there in the next couple days to at least install on.
**Jdawson**: I think we got like 13 of them that are ready to go.
**Jdawson**: And then they started the break room electrical today.
**Jdawson**: And we're working on pricing up the.
**Jdawson**: The Baylor move.
**Jdawson**: And then they just added more.
**Jdawson**: They added more to little Sleepies.
**Jdawson**: We got to do 16 more drops to little Sleepies, more guardrail, and it's just like never ending.
**Jmendez**: Does that need to be priced up.
**Jdawson**: AJ for the Baylor move?
**Jdawson**: Needs to be the Baylor.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, the little sleepies.
**Jdawson**: I haven't seen an updated CAD drawing sent to us yet, Keva.
**Jdawson**: Have you.
**Jmendez**: He did send an updated drawing with the B relocation.
**Jmendez**: I didn't check if other areas.
**Jmendez**: I have it downloaded.
**Jmendez**: I can check.
**Jmendez**: I was only looking for the bailout information.
**Jdawson**: JB's in town.
**Jdawson**: He flies out tomorrow, and then he's going to Europe.
**Jdawson**: So I'm gonna.
**Jdawson**: I'm gonna try and have a little more clarity on direction, on how.
**Jdawson**: Because with these guys, you never know, you know how soon or when they need it by.
**Jdawson**: So I. I hope to have more clarity on that tomorrow.
**Ataylor**: You know, he's going to be gone.
**Jdawson**: He leaves Friday, and he's not coming back until the following.
**Jdawson**: So he leaves.
**Jdawson**: He's in town.
**Jdawson**: He got in town around 11 today, leaves tomorrow afternoon around 4:30.
**Jdawson**: And then he's not going to be back until the 18th of August.
**Jdawson**: So I'm really.
**Ataylor**: I'm really hoping all week next week.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I'm really hoping to impress him.
**Jdawson**: And half all the doctors done in.
**Ataylor**: The next week would be great.
**Jdawson**: That's three weeks ahead of schedule.
**Jdawson**: Four weeks almost.
**Gducharme**: Okay, thank you, guys.
**Jmendez**: Sorry, before.
**Jmendez**: Before we skip to the next one.
**Jmendez**: AJ if you can get me the information of the.
**Jmendez**: The framer that build view platform so I can add them for billing.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, they did.
**Jdawson**: You see, they sent us an invoice.
**Jmendez**: No, I know the rose paving guys they sent us.
**Bclymer**: Are we not writing subcontracts to these people?
**Jmendez**: Not.
**Jmendez**: Not all of them, because some of them happen to guys.
**Bclymer**: When someone provides labor and materials, you have to write a subcontract and then they have to give us their insurance.
**Jdawson**: Right?
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: So we have updated insurance from them.
**Jdawson**: Jesse, this.
**Jdawson**: That's on me.
**Jdawson**: This happened so quick.
**Jdawson**: They.
**Jdawson**: JP Needed them out there the next day as far as the pavers go in these framers.
**Jdawson**: And so we bought all the material for the framing and then, yeah, it did happen really quick.
**Jdawson**: And so the only way to get these things pushed through quickly you know, subcontract would have taken a long time for the review.
**Jdawson**: So that.
**Jdawson**: That's on me.
**Ataylor**: How much was this was the value of this stuff?
**Jdawson**: So our material we bought with credit card and then the labor was say 12.
**Jdawson**: 12 grand was the labor cost?
**Jmendez**: Yeah, and I think material was about the same, actually.
**Jmendez**: Maybe 12, 13 grand.
**Jmendez**: We had budgeted, I think 30 something.
**Bclymer**: I'm just saying writing a subcontract takes about 20 minutes for something of that size, so.
**Jdawson**: No, I. I totally understand, Jesse.
**Jdawson**: That's on me.
**Jdawson**: There was no.
**Jdawson**: The only way to get especially.
**Jdawson**: Especially with those pavement marking guys.
**Jdawson**: I mean, JP Needed in four days.
**Jdawson**: And they.
**Jdawson**: I asked them, I said, you know, I'm gonna send you a subcontract.
**Jdawson**: And the guy's like, well, I can't sign it.
**Jdawson**: My owner has to sign it.
**Jdawson**: And that may take days.
**Jdawson**: And so I said, okay, well, a purchase order due.
**Jdawson**: So we wrote them a purchase order.
**Ataylor**: You've got the insurance from both of them.
**Jdawson**: I. I don't know about Rose paving.
**Jdawson**: Who did the pay.
**Jdawson**: Who did the.
**Jdawson**: The pavement markings?
**Ataylor**: We.
**Jdawson**: We do for.
**Jdawson**: For Yemi.
**Ataylor**: Okay, well, let's get their insurance.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I know he added more pavement markings.
**Jdawson**: So I'll make a note here to make sure I get it.
**Bclymer**: It's just if they run into something or they damage something or they run over somebody or hurt someone, we have no protection.
**Bclymer**: They'll come after us and our insurance.
**Jdawson**: So 100% agree and understood.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: Spirocus.
**Njepson**: Yeah, I'll get the owners a warranty.
**Jdawson**: On this.
**Njepson**: And where we have the invoices in.
**Gducharme**: Thank you, Nick.
**Gducharme**: Radial bronze bar, aging Keva, you think?
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So they added more.
**Jdawson**: They added more guardrail to this.
**Jdawson**: That JP1's done this week.
**Jdawson**: I already got pricing for it, so he's supposed to issue me a PO for that for the added guardrail.
**Jdawson**: And then they did give us a PO for the original amount.
**Jdawson**: So we're.
**Jdawson**: We're done with that and build in full.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: Glenn Goodwill Decatur.
**Ataylor**: That.
**Kmass**: That project is complete.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, your cosat docs.
**Bclymer**: I sent him over.
**Kmass**: Yes, I already sent him in.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: Okay, so changing it to complete.
**Bclymer**: What is.
**Bclymer**: Is there anything left with those desks that we gotta supposedly replace or fix?
**Kmass**: No, we're done.
**Kmass**: Facilities are gonna take care of the desk and the two doors.
**Kmass**: They said we're good.
**Kmass**: We brought them a little gift package and their extension cord back last week.
**Ataylor**: And.
**Kmass**: Left them happy.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: The last one we have Nick Jepson.
**Gducharme**: Nick the reveling honks that's scheduled to.
**Njepson**: Be completed this week.
**Jdawson**: We.
**Njepson**: We got the first billing and then they mailed the check to the office in Indianapolis.
**Ataylor**: Nice.
**Bclymer**: So Nick, we need to.
**Bclymer**: Brian gets back next week, so we just got to get this new layout put together for the townhomes and we'll get that to them so that he.
**Ataylor**: Can.
**Bclymer**: Probably move on pretty quickly.
**Bclymer**: When his lady, Virginia, I think surname met us out there, she's like, do you want to check today?
**Ataylor**: Last week you do?
**Bclymer**: I'm like, well, let us start the work first.
**Bclymer**: How about that?
**Ataylor**: Made my mind.
**Jdawson**: Are they going to end up building homes there?
**Ataylor**: Jesse?
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: He wants to do eight to ten townhomes.
**Jdawson**: Nice.
**Gducharme**: Okay, guys, any other projects?
**Gducharme**: We need to add a spurring ones before we move to estimating about this.
**Gducharme**: It says new project, no projects.
**Gducharme**: Okay, let me just delete this one for some reason.
**Gducharme**: Send me project.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: Estimating.
**Gducharme**: AJ Stonegate Orchardontist.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, no update there.
**Ataylor**: What's the.
**Ataylor**: I mean, what's the word?
**Jdawson**: So when I spoke with Ron, maybe it wasn't last week, but the week before, like late, late the week before.
**Jdawson**: He.
**Jdawson**: The guy that was taking the other tenant side, you know, he backed out of the deal and so they're getting him off the land.
**Jdawson**: They're still.
**Jdawson**: It's still moving forward.
**Jdawson**: He loves what we did.
**Jdawson**: It's just right now they got to wait to get him off the deed.
**Jdawson**: He said he'll.
**Jdawson**: He'll call me in a couple weeks, so I told him I'd follow up with him here couple weeks in August.
**Ataylor**: Gotcha.
**Jdawson**: But I mean, they know that we.
**Jdawson**: They like the layout we did.
**Jdawson**: We already have an idea of what the building looks like, so, I mean, this is probably gonna.
**Jdawson**: They're still gearing up for being in there.
**Jdawson**: The 20, you know, in 2027.
**Jdawson**: Just.
**Jdawson**: I don't even think they're reluctant to pull the trigger, but I think he'll feel better.
**Jdawson**: He's pretty conservative.
**Jdawson**: He'd feel better if he had a tenant already lined up.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: They'Re pregnant.
**Ataylor**: They.
**Jdawson**: They own the land.
**Gducharme**: Brandon M.
**Ataylor**: We're still.
**Ataylor**: The updated layout is still the same.
**Ataylor**: Same thing.
**Ataylor**: So should have that this week.
**Gducharme**: Jesse and Brandon Pardes aisle.
**Ataylor**: Well, we're through round one.
**Ataylor**: Three more rounds to go.
**Jdawson**: Do you not feel comfortable with putting a job number on this one yet?
**Ataylor**: No.
**Bclymer**: You can't charge your time to it, aj.
**Jdawson**: I got too much to charge my time to right now.
**Ataylor**: AKA Radial.
**Ataylor**: Oh, wow, look at that.
**Ataylor**: No time to Neiman or Danville Demon.
**Jdawson**: We're Tied on.
**Jdawson**: I've been charging to applied in radial.
**Ataylor**: I'm sure you have.
**Jdawson**: Water always finds its level.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: NoblesBuild Excel center, this is Jesse.
**Gducharme**: Nick.
**Njepson**: Sorry, I'll follow up with Goodwill tomorrow regarding meeting with the school administrator, but.
**Ataylor**: We'Ll see him down there.
**Ataylor**: So.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, what.
**Jdawson**: What time's your guys shindig tomorrow?
**Ataylor**: 9:30.
**Jdawson**: Have they already started using it?
**Jdawson**: This is just a formality.
**Bclymer**: I mean it's been open for a year.
**Bclymer**: Almost seems like.
**Ataylor**: Well, yeah.
**Ataylor**: I mean not quite, I don't think, but yeah, it's been a bit.
**Bclymer**: You know, we finished in.
**Bclymer**: Was it January or February?
**Bclymer**: I think it's not that long.
**Jdawson**: The first official full school year.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: Ulta Beauty, Fresno, this is aj.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: So, Brandon, I know I've seen you and Jesse are talking a little bit.
**Ataylor**: So I guess we're.
**Jdawson**: We're working on cutting out some pricing.
**Jdawson**: It seems like that 1.1 number came in pretty good.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: So we need to.
**Ataylor**: I need to get.
**Jdawson**: What do you want?
**Ataylor**: Numbers and stuff so I can.
**Ataylor**: So update the estimate.
**Ataylor**: You know, give me an R1 that.
**Ataylor**: That shows that one.
**Ataylor**: That way I can get back with Walter.
**Jdawson**: And then Brennan sent a number to us, said it was 175k for the electrical.
**Jdawson**: More like.
**Jdawson**: Which is awesome, but I know he said like 300k, he wants to cut out.
**Jdawson**: So how generous do you want to be to them or do you want to be aggressive?
**Ataylor**: I mean we're.
**Jdawson**: I know the number.
**Ataylor**: We're not going to go low.
**Ataylor**: I mean budget.
**Jdawson**: So then I can just put a price together for 300k less.
**Ataylor**: I mean, I like again, I would.
**Ataylor**: I would like to get an actual updated estimate showing, you know, what our other.
**Ataylor**: What our true numbers are.
**Ataylor**: Right.
**Ataylor**: And then from there we can I go in and say.
**Ataylor**: Okay, add money here, here, here.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Do we have any update on our Arizona letter?
**Ataylor**: We got the letter.
**Bclymer**: We just gotta get the.
**Bclymer**: The original hasn't come in the mail yet.

**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Gducharme**: Yep.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: Tampa office building.
**Gducharme**: Jesse.

**Ataylor**: Yeah, yeah, I'll.
**Ataylor**: I'll reach out to Dustin.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: Nick.
**Gducharme**: Goodwill.

**Gducharme**: And we have viola expansion.
**Gducharme**: This is Jesse.
**Gducharme**: Nick.
**Gducharme**: Sorry.
**Ataylor**: He.
**Bclymer**: The owner gets back from Europe in a week and then.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, it was same thing as last week.
**Bclymer**: So next week he should be back in town.
**Bclymer**: We're going to review the proposals.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: We have Birmingham rise building edition.
**Gducharme**: A.J.
**Ataylor**: That'S me.
**Jdawson**: Or meetings this.
**Jdawson**: Brandy, you said meetings this week, right?
**Jdawson**: The.
**Ataylor**: It already went through the board.
**Ataylor**: It was last week.
**Ataylor**: It was approved.
**Ataylor**: So I.
**Ataylor**: So Mark reached out to me, or I reached out to him, I guess, anyway.
**Ataylor**: But we talked and he wanted some more information on our company.
**Ataylor**: So I sent him that video.
**Ataylor**: Video testimonial from one of our existing clients.
**Ataylor**: And then I put a video together as well.
**Ataylor**: Kind of go overview and everything and send it to him.
**Ataylor**: So I haven't heard back yet.
**Ataylor**: Nice.
**Jdawson**: You send that last week.
**Jdawson**: I remember you saying you're working on it.
**Ataylor**: I sent it this morning.
**Jdawson**: Okay, we got time.
**Gducharme**: Okay, then we have 440.
**Gducharme**: This is AJ as well, correct?
**Gducharme**: Alec, this is you.
**Gducharme**: 441 building.
**Fireflies**: Yeah.
**Fireflies**: So Jesse, I'm not sure if you have any updates.
**Fireflies**: I don't believe the owner was Tim that we're talking to and I haven't seen any updates back from him.
**Bclymer**: We sent him a breakout of the canopies and they gotta wait for the board to vote on what they want to do.
**Ataylor**: I need to follow up with them.
**Bclymer**: I'll do that.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Fireflies**: I'll make that note in there.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: Then we have Radial, Godiva, Martinsville, Keva.
**Jmendez**: Yes, we have.
**Jmendez**: We have sent out the pricing for this aj.
**Jmendez**: I don't know if you heard anything from JP yet.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, so jp, he wants.
**Jdawson**: Do we have pricing for that curtain wall?
**Jmendez**: I did receive pricing, yes.
**Jdawson**: Can you forward that to me?
**Jdawson**: And then I'm just going to write an email and say.
**Ataylor**: I'm gonna.
**Jdawson**: I already told him we don't want to do the curtain wall.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, it just makes no sense because they're just going to come in and be pissed that it's not cooling properly.
**Jdawson**: Like we want to build that demising wall.
**Jdawson**: Now granted, I told him we would, we would entertain the idea, but we're going to advise highly against it.
**Jdawson**: That's where I left it out with them.
**Jdawson**: So let's.
**Jdawson**: Let's.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, so I mean, let's do an order of magnitude.
**Jdawson**: You know, it's going to take five carpenters three weeks plus the material cost and then our fee and then, you know, charge their hourly rate at 125 bucks an hour.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, Yeah.
**Jmendez**: I think everything with the labor added to it, it wouldn't be too much of a difference.
**Jmendez**: It's 213.
**Jdawson**: Oh yeah.
**Jdawson**: I mean, save him 100k.
**Jmendez**: Maybe not even yeah, that's just the material, so.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay, well, can you save in the file or something and we'll get.
**Jdawson**: I'll get it to him before he leaves tomorrow.
**Jmendez**: Okay.
**Jmendez**: And again, it's not.
**Jmendez**: It's not as.
**Jmendez**: The R value is not as much as what we are providing.
**Jmendez**: So.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, there's no more close.
**Gducharme**: Okay, thank you, AJ and then we have Columbus Christian Academy, AJ, YouTube, they're meeting here.
**Jdawson**: We have a meeting set like what, the 23rd or something with them.
**Ataylor**: So.
**Jdawson**: Get some clarity there.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: And the last one we have Vargo permitting.
**Gducharme**: Ag.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Did you get any clarity on the Nevada, how long it's going to take us to get a permit there?
**Jdawson**: Me, Maria or you?
