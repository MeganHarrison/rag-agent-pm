## Transcript
**Bclymer**: Kitchen chair.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Do you.
**Jdawson**: Do you know, do you have a chair that you want or you just want me to order you on?
**Bclymer**: Or you can.
**Bclymer**: Or I can just stop by and grab one at.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, office, whatever.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that works.
**Jdawson**: That works too.
**Jdawson**: And then.
**Jdawson**: So, Maria, what about, like monitors and all that?
**Bclymer**: What was that?
**Jdawson**: What about monitors and whatnot?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I got monitors.
**Bclymer**: Nick's got his monitors already.
**Bclymer**: We'll need some chairs if people are coming in to meet those.
**Bclymer**: You probably can order online to get.
**Bclymer**: I don't know if you want to get a standard going for everything in here.
**Bclymer**: If we're going to go with these type of desks.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I figured we'd do this because those are the same.
**Jdawson**: Aren't those the same desks that we have up here?
**Bclymer**: No, they're the Costco, which is.
**Jdawson**: You have to text me a picture of them.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And then you.
**Jdawson**: You need, I guess, bookshelves too.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, we'll need some bookshelves.
**Jdawson**: You think like just like these little black ones we have up here?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I'll need a probably file.
**Bclymer**: If we had these desks, there's no filing cabinets or anything, so a shelf would be ideal instead of filing cabinet.
**Bclymer**: Actually.
**Jdawson**: A shelf.
**Bclymer**: Well, the.
**Bclymer**: Those book rack or bookshelves like you're saying.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, like.
**Jdawson**: Like we have in the.
**Jdawson**: In the office here.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, Yep.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we can.
**Jdawson**: We can order that.
**Jdawson**: And so looking at this, this drawing here.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: And then where's Nick at?
**Bclymer**: He's right next to me.
**Bclymer**: This one.
**Bclymer**: That one.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: And then I guess, you know, the.
**Jdawson**: The APM probably put him right here, I guess.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: Alec, break room.
**Jdawson**: Are we.
**Jdawson**: We're gonna make these three offices, right?
**Jdawson**: Or is there something else you want to do with them?
**Bclymer**: Oh, you do conference room in that first one off the lobby.
**Jdawson**: This one?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Figured office would be the one next to mine.
**Bclymer**: This one, that one.
**Jdawson**: And then these two are just, I guess, open offices.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, it goes that.
**Bclymer**: That one back in the corner.
**Bclymer**: If we had a couple field engineers or whatever that could be set up with, you know, three desks in there.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: All right, so boom, boom, boom.
**Jdawson**: All right, so those two have desks.
**Jdawson**: So we need desperate hand me and then conference table.
**Bclymer**: I'll get the dimensions for the.
**Bclymer**: I'll send you dimensions.
**Bclymer**: Can you email that to me and I'll put dimensions on everything and figure out what will fit.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Maria, can you shoot this over to Jesse, please?
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, everything is on the top of folder, but I'll share with you now.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: All right, so then I'll Yeah, I'll get.
**Jdawson**: We'll figure that out.
**Jdawson**: We'll.
**Jdawson**: I'll get everything ordered, and then we'll line up somebody to build it all so we're not dealing with it.
**Jdawson**: So we need book.
**Bclymer**: Shell bookshelves, the copy machine.
**Bclymer**: Are we renting one?
**Jdawson**: We're releasing one up here.
**Jdawson**: I mean, I've got.
**Jdawson**: I've got a printer at.
**Jdawson**: At my apartment I was going to bring over.
**Jdawson**: It's just like a little, you know, normal one, or do you think we need a big boy like that?
**Bclymer**: Does it print 11 by 17?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Oh, that's fine.
**Bclymer**: And it's wireless.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we'll.
**Jdawson**: We'll start with the normal one and.
**Jdawson**: And if we need to.
**Jdawson**: To change, then we can.
**Bclymer**: It's probably not worth it.
**Bclymer**: What do you spend a hundred dollars a month or something for that?
**Jdawson**: Two weeks?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So, like, if you needed something big printed out, you can get sent it to Kinko's, you know?
**Jdawson**: Exactly.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I mean, this.
**Jdawson**: The.
**Jdawson**: This printer, you know, Dip.
**Jdawson**: Doug lined it up.
**Jdawson**: I tried to back out of it, but I'm stuck.
**Jdawson**: You know, whatever.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: So, yeah, we seen bookshelves, des chairs.
**Bclymer**: Little break room table, maybe.
**Jdawson**: Anything else?
**Jdawson**: What about, like, you know, we need, you know, docking station power.
**Bclymer**: Power strips.
**Jdawson**: On a tours.
**Bclymer**: So when you're getting chairs, you're going to get a few.
**Bclymer**: Like a couple to put in the reception area.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And then couple for the break room.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, the break room table will get chairs with it.
**Jdawson**: Same thing with the conference table.
**Jdawson**: Anything else?
**Bclymer**: Now there's blinds.
**Bclymer**: I don't know what kind of your art, your Alito artwork.
**Bclymer**: You know, there's some.
**Bclymer**: Just have some on the walls if you.
**Bclymer**: If you want that.
**Jdawson**: But yeah, I mean, yeah, I'm sure we'll get something.
**Jdawson**: You know, we'll have to figure that out.
**Jdawson**: And then you said.
**Jdawson**: You said blinds.
**Bclymer**: No, I said it already has blinds on it.
**Jdawson**: Oh, it already has blinds.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Anything else?
**Bclymer**: Trash cans.
**Jdawson**: Trash cans.
**Bclymer**: And then as far as the.
**Bclymer**: Just soap and paper towels for the break room.
**Bclymer**: Is that stuff we'll just pick up?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, you just grab that at.
**Jdawson**: When you go grab your chair.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Probably grab the trash cans, too.
**Jdawson**: Easy enough.
**Jdawson**: Anything else you can think of?
**Bclymer**: Not really.
**Bclymer**: I mean that, but you do it.
**Bclymer**: Everything else is set up in here, so.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Wonder.
**Jdawson**: What.
**Bclymer**: I just want her in, like, the reception area to maybe just get a couch that.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, that's instead of chairs.
**Bclymer**: Did you put that on there?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I got reception chairs, but I can say reception.
**Jdawson**: Just say Furniture.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I figure we'll have a.
**Jdawson**: Probably like, have like a couch here and then maybe like a chair here, Chair here and then a table.
**Bclymer**: You make it a.
**Bclymer**: Like a fold out.
**Bclymer**: So if I sleep here, I can.
**Jdawson**: Just crash that futon.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, that's it.
**Jdawson**: Well, we'll just.
**Jdawson**: We can just make this office a bunk room for now.
**Bclymer**: There you go.
**Speaker 2**: Do you guys have water thing for you for the break room?
**Bclymer**: It has a sink.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So we'll run a water line to.
**Jdawson**: We'll get a fridge that has a water.
**Speaker 2**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Thing.
**Bclymer**: You should see how pure the water is in our Indianapolis office.
**Bclymer**: I mean, it's extraordinary.
**Speaker 2**: What about.
**Speaker 2**: Do you guys need cameras and all that stuff?
**Bclymer**: No.
**Bclymer**: Cameras.
**Jdawson**: Cameras.
**Speaker 2**: No.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: No.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So I think that's all the stuff we probably need to order.
**Jdawson**: You said you do or you don't want a filing cabinet.
**Bclymer**: Just the shelf is fine.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Or no, I changed my mind.
**Bclymer**: I need a filing cabinet.
**Jdawson**: You want one for just you or every office?
**Bclymer**: Nick, would you use a filing cabinet.
**Jdawson**: Or just a shell?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I thought it was just because I'm old and I wanted a filing cabinet, but Nick wants one too, so that's.
**Jdawson**: Because he wants to be like you could be.
**Bclymer**: Okay, then I can just pick up some hanging folders and like that.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: All right, cool.
**Jdawson**: That's it on the office, right?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I can't think of anything else.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I mean, I'm sure we'll think of it and ordered as needed.
**Jdawson**: Do you want to.
**Jdawson**: You want to TV or anything for your office?
**Bclymer**: Not really.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: We may want to get one for the conference room.
**Jdawson**: Oh, yeah.
**Bclymer**: I have one at home that I never use.
**Bclymer**: I could bring it in.
**Bclymer**: It's like a 50 inch.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I mean, is it.
**Jdawson**: Is it like one of the new smart ones that you can cast stuff to that?
**Bclymer**: I don't know.
**Bclymer**: I've had it a while probably.
**Bclymer**: I had it in Fort Myers, so it's like 8 years old.
**Jdawson**: That probably doesn't have it then.
**Jdawson**: But we.
**Jdawson**: I mean, we can.
**Jdawson**: You can try it, I guess.
**Jdawson**: And it's not like TVs aren't super expensive.
**Jdawson**: You know, get a pretty good TV for 500 bucks.
**Bclymer**: Exactly.
**Bclymer**: And I got the.
**Bclymer**: I have two wall mount brackets too, so I can bring that in, mount it.
**Bclymer**: If it doesn't work, we'll just get a different one.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we can always put, you know, put.
**Jdawson**: Put that one in the reception or something if we need to.
**Jdawson**: Or the break room.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Because then you can play like start Looping your.
**Bclymer**: Whatever you put on your websites and stuff.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: Not that we have a lot of visitors to the office anyway.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And then.
**Jdawson**: All right, cool.
**Jdawson**: So there's.
**Jdawson**: That's taken care of.
**Jdawson**: What about.
**Jdawson**: Are you.
**Jdawson**: You want to call that out guy and follow up with him?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I'll check with him this morning.
**Jdawson**: Gotcha.
**Jdawson**: Is there anything you need from me?
**Bclymer**: I don't think so.
**Bclymer**: I'm going through this.
**Jdawson**: Oh, I need to fill out that intern thing.
**Bclymer**: Oh yeah, you gotta send that back to them.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: So I'll get that filled out and sent back to you.
**Jdawson**: And then does that guy start.
**Speaker 2**: May 19?
**Speaker 2**: I think so.
**Speaker 2**: The intern?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: May 19, you said on May 12?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So he starts and then he works two weeks and then he has to go.
**Bclymer**: He's on some faculty thing for a couple of weeks.
**Jdawson**: What's the start date?
**Jdawson**: Is it May 12th or 19th?
**Bclymer**: Checking via Monday.
**Bclymer**: I put it in this offer.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, I think I.
**Speaker 2**: May 12th, but I'm checking right now.
**Speaker 2**: He's offer letter.
**Jdawson**: Well, May 12th is next Monday.
**Speaker 2**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: Where's he going to be working at?
**Bclymer**: I just figured he'd split his time.
**Bclymer**: I didn't at the time.
**Bclymer**: I wasn't thinking about Andrew being out there.
**Bclymer**: But he can split his time between the office next Monday out at the Westfield Collective, and then also he can look at some of these other jobs like this Bloomington.
**Bclymer**: I'm gonna.
**Bclymer**: They got to make some changes to this proposal.
**Bclymer**: Foundations.
**Bclymer**: But yeah.
**Jdawson**: Where does he live?
**Bclymer**: He has family that lives here in Indianapolis, so he's just staying with them.
**Jdawson**: All right, so then I need to get in the computer, right?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: And he also sent something for the supervisor.
**Speaker 2**: We said it was you, Jesse, but if it's going to be Brandon, it's going to be you.
**Speaker 2**: Okay.
**Speaker 2**: Because he needs to fill out something for his university.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Did he send that to you?
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, he sent it to you and myself.
**Speaker 2**: I can resend it, don't worry.
**Speaker 2**: No, actually he said he will get in touch with you.
**Speaker 2**: He just needs to.
**Speaker 2**: He's going to ask you some questions.
**Jdawson**: What's his name again?
**Speaker 2**: Ian.
**Speaker 2**: Ian Cass.
**Jdawson**: Is that with it?
**Speaker 2**: I I A N I A N.
**Speaker 2**: Yes.
**Speaker 2**: Ian.
**Speaker 2**: Cassie.
**Speaker 2**: Cat K A A S E.
**Speaker 2**: So I A N.
**Speaker 2**: All right.
**Jdawson**: So I got a computer for him and then he.
**Jdawson**: He doesn't need.
**Jdawson**: He probably doesn't need Microsoft Project.
**Jdawson**: He probably just needs obviously an email, you know.
**Jdawson**: You think he needs blue beam, Jesse?
**Bclymer**: I would think he'd just be viewing stuff on it, but like he.
**Bclymer**: He Knows he can do CAD because he's also in whatever their program is.
**Bclymer**: So it's up to you what you want to have him do.
**Jdawson**: I mean, what.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, what were you gonna.
**Jdawson**: I mean, what was his role gonna be?
**Jdawson**: Just.
**Bclymer**: Well, I.
**Bclymer**: I wanted him to spend some time helping with the estimating, spend some time out in the field.
**Bclymer**: You can help Chad and then going to some of these other job sites, you know, the smaller ones, and then helping Glenn out, you know, seeing with the billings and submittals.
**Bclymer**: Like, he can help Nick out with submittals.
**Bclymer**: And really just they talk to the guys and see where they need the most help.
**Bclymer**: And you can.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: So everything was already set up for him, though, like the email.
**Speaker 2**: He didn't set up the project planner, just the standard one.
**Jdawson**: He doesn't need Microsoft Project at all.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, just a standard one.
**Speaker 2**: And then we have everything, Bluebeam and Procore in your planner.
**Speaker 2**: If you guys want me to take him off, we can do that.
**Speaker 2**: But everything is set up.
**Speaker 2**: Everything was sent already to him.
**Speaker 2**: He's already added to payroll two and then just waiting for on Monday.
**Speaker 2**: I told him to start the onboarding process with you, Jesse or Andrew.
**Speaker 2**: It's up to you.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Because I'll be gone next week taking my daughter to her job, so it'll have to be Andrew, but.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: I would give him with Andrew and, you know, get him out to Collective.
**Bclymer**: And then, I mean, he could assist AJ too, on.
**Bclymer**: You know, he's got a lot of contracts, subcontracts he needs to write for all those jobs he's got going.
**Speaker 2**: Okay.
**Speaker 2**: He's ready.
**Speaker 2**: So whatever you guys need from me, that's done.
**Speaker 2**: And also, yeah, just get in touch with him.
**Speaker 2**: He needs to submit something from university about something he needs to send prior to his work day.
**Bclymer**: So I think it's what Brandon, I think is probably that form.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I got it.
**Jdawson**: I'll fill it out after this call.
**Jdawson**: I mean, let's.
**Jdawson**: Let's remember, like, we don't actually expect any real production out of this guy.
**Jdawson**: Like, it's.
**Jdawson**: It's more of an investment on our end, you know, to.
**Jdawson**: To have it.
**Jdawson**: So again, we know it's a sunk cost.
**Jdawson**: Like, it's not like he's gonna produce anything.
**Jdawson**: So even if he has to be out at.
**Jdawson**: At Collective just as an extra body, like, it is what it is, you know, I mean, we're just having him there to.
**Jdawson**: To learn.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Is this like.
**Bclymer**: This is how you get in the US the best way to develop Maria is you get Them when they do their interns with you in college and then you're teaching them what you do and how you do it, and then they just come to work for you as soon as they get out of college.
**Bclymer**: And you know, they.
**Bclymer**: In my experience, that turns out the best people.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, a lot of times it does.
**Jdawson**: I've had great luck with the guys that have interned for me for a couple years and they hire.
**Jdawson**: Right on.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: Nice.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: So, yeah, so I need to get a computer for him, you know, fill out intern agreement.
**Speaker 2**: This guy didn't reply though.
**Speaker 2**: The Ben guy?
**Speaker 2**: Jesse, for his offer letter.
**Speaker 2**: I sent it to him, he didn't reply.
**Speaker 2**: You want me to call him or.
**Jdawson**: Who's Ben?
**Speaker 2**: Ben, the project assistant.
**Speaker 2**: Project manager.
**Jdawson**: I thought his name was Alec.
**Speaker 2**: No, is it Alec?
**Speaker 2**: Ben, Alec, Ben.
**Jdawson**: Ben is the guy that was before that turned us down from Orlando.
**Speaker 2**: One second.
**Speaker 2**: Who do I send it to?
**Speaker 2**: I think it was Alec.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, when I talked to Alec last.
**Speaker 2**: Week, you know, you're right, I sent.
**Bclymer**: It to, you know, I said, I'm gonna send you the offer letter.
**Bclymer**: And he's like, yeah, I just need to look at the offer letter.
**Bclymer**: So I'll give him a call.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, and see, I sent everything for him just to make sure.
**Speaker 2**: And this guy will be starting on May 19th.
**Bclymer**: I don't know.
**Bclymer**: He has to.
**Bclymer**: He has to.
**Bclymer**: He hasn't accepted it.
**Speaker 2**: Correct.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Speaker 2**: So yeah, let me know if he accepted.
**Speaker 2**: So yeah, I just send it to her.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, no, I appreciate.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And then I.
**Jdawson**: Maria, I.
**Jdawson**: We should.
**Jdawson**: And then Jesse, like those attorneys are working on our updated operating agreement to add you to it.
**Jdawson**: So hopefully we should have a draft within the end of next week.
**Jdawson**: I mean, these guys move like molasses, but.
**Speaker 2**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Which it's funny because we're going to have that for about six months.
**Jdawson**: Not even that.
**Jdawson**: And then we'll change to a C corp, but whatever.
**Bclymer**: Right?
**Bclymer**: What is the big difference there?
**Jdawson**: The way we're taxed.
**Jdawson**: So right now it's a pass through, like S Corp llc.
**Jdawson**: But we, we've, you know, gotten to the size now where it needs to be a C corp so that the entity is.
**Jdawson**: Is taxed by itself as an entity versus everything just being a pass through.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: But yeah, I mean, it's not a big deal.
**Jdawson**: I don't like the operating agreement will just do an amendment to change it from an LLC to a C corp or we'll just create a new one.
**Jdawson**: But yeah, we've got another tax team working on.
**Jdawson**: On that and I.
**Jdawson**: So it'll.
**Jdawson**: It'll be whatever.
**Jdawson**: At least we'll have a clear line showing the transitions.
**Jdawson**: Cool.
**Jdawson**: Anything else do you have for me or Jesse?
**Jdawson**: Maria?
**Speaker 2**: No.
**Speaker 2**: Jesse, we have your iPhone set up today.
**Speaker 2**: Don't break it, please.
**Bclymer**: This thing, all I had to do was shatter it worse than it's ever been shattered.
**Bclymer**: And it works.
**Bclymer**: It's been working great.
**Speaker 2**: Okay, so we have your setup today.
**Speaker 2**: We just need to call and then I'll just ask you for some things and that's it.
**Speaker 2**: Okay, I'll send it to you.
**Speaker 2**: The guys already have their hotspots, so just so you know, Glenn has a hotspot, Mike has a hotspot, and also I forgot the name.
**Speaker 2**: Sorry, Jack.
**Speaker 2**: So all.
**Speaker 2**: All of them has the hotspot they needed.
**Speaker 2**: Other than that, I don't think I need anything else from you guys.
**Jdawson**: Do we have some.
**Jdawson**: We have some kind of tracking that shows the serial numbers.
**Jdawson**: And who's got those?
**Speaker 2**: We do.
**Speaker 2**: We do.
**Speaker 2**: Everything is on Verizon.
**Speaker 2**: Also, don't forget.
**Speaker 2**: So Fatima called AAT for the audit thing, so she's working on some stuff.
**Speaker 2**: Everything is ready.
**Speaker 2**: I'm just waiting for them to give you the green light so you can send them.
**Speaker 2**: But all the letters are done and then that's it.
**Speaker 2**: Jesse, Andrew needs the contract license agreement for Indianapolis.
**Speaker 2**: Do you have that?
**Speaker 2**: I check on the executive folder, but I don't know exactly where that is.
**Jdawson**: What is it?
**Speaker 2**: What the.
**Speaker 2**: He said if I know where is the contract copy of Alitos.
**Speaker 2**: Indiana contractor's license.
**Bclymer**: So there's just.
**Speaker 2**: Is a license he's working on.
**Jdawson**: Oh, there.
**Jdawson**: There is no state license for GCS in Indiana.
**Jdawson**: We have an Indianapolis one, but he wouldn't.
**Bclymer**: He was just.
**Bclymer**: It was for the Georgia.
**Bclymer**: I'm sorry, Arkansas one.
**Bclymer**: He wanted to know exactly what our.
**Bclymer**: In the entities call.
**Bclymer**: Is it Alito llc?
**Bclymer**: Yep, that's what I thought.
**Bclymer**: Because.
**Bclymer**: Because we were putting group in there and that's not it.
**Bclymer**: It's just.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And all that stuff is in the accounting company files folder, Maria.
**Jdawson**: Like that's our articles, our eins, all that stuff.
**Jdawson**: So all that information is in there.
**Speaker 2**: Okay, good.
**Jdawson**: Certificate of existence, everything.
**Speaker 2**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Anything else?
**Bclymer**: How is Georgia?
**Bclymer**: The Georgia application.
**Speaker 2**: The George application.
**Speaker 2**: You mean the business one?
**Bclymer**: Well, for our GC to get the GC license there.
**Speaker 2**: So.
**Speaker 2**: So what I worked on was the business license, the business or the business registration of the company on Georgia.
**Speaker 2**: So that's done.
**Speaker 2**: If we need to set up for Georgia, let me know so I can just Start gathering everything.
**Bclymer**: We've saved a lot.
**Bclymer**: There's a.
**Bclymer**: In the brand and that executive folder, there's a Georgia GC license folder.
**Bclymer**: And I have some original copies because Georgia doesn't.
**Bclymer**: You have to mail them a hard copy of this stuff.
**Bclymer**: So I had to get.
