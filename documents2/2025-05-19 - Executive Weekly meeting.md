**Speaker 1**: Jesse said he did take the Nascala for the Georgia.
**Bclymer**: The NASCAR is a one thing.
**Bclymer**: It's the business and law.
**Speaker 1**: But I think it is accepted for that license if I'm not wrong.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So there's two.
**Bclymer**: There's two tests.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: There's the construction one, which NASCA is accepted by Georgia just like it is Florida and all these other states.
**Bclymer**: But then each state has its own business in law exam.
**Speaker 1**: Gotcha.
**Bclymer**: And so the business in law is what?
**Bclymer**: I wasn't sure if he is taking it for Georgia.
**Bclymer**: Unless it's.
**Bclymer**: Unless it.
**Bclymer**: It's reciprocal, which it probably is not.

**Speaker 1**: That was the issue because everything was done.
**Speaker 1**: We just needed to know if you received.
