## Transcript
**Jdawson**: Hey, this meeting's starting, so I'll get back to you see it.
**Jdawson**: Hello.
**Jdawson**: I will, yeah, bye.
**Jdawson**: Hello.
**Tj.shelters**: Hey, Jesse, how you doing?
**Tj.shelters**: Good, good.
**Evin.sisemore**: How are you doing?
**Jdawson**: Good.
**Tj.shelters**: So I wanted to, I wanted to get us all back together speaking, you know, you and I spoke a little bit about a couple of other options, but before diving into there, I just wanted to go on the Powerhive one more time.
**Tj.shelters**: So it's the Power Hive.
**Tj.shelters**: Based off like the last email you sent me, I sent you over all the power, the available, the power required for the number of chargers.
**Tj.shelters**: And how did that end up with siva?
**Jdawson**: So, like, you know, it's kind of crazy.
**Jdawson**: It's just because it's a new system and yeah, it's, you know, the first time they hear about it, you know, and you know, I sent them all your information.
**Jdawson**: So like on that system.
**Jdawson**: So, you know, maybe they've had time to look at it.
**Jdawson**: But you know, in a follow up meeting we had late last week, you know, I just went through and added up, you know, using your numbers for the equipment and then the lights and you know, the dot, you know, the dock, you know, door equipment and everything else.
**Jdawson**: And like I was up over without any H vac, like almost 6,000amps, which is their entire, you know, that's all they have, completely available.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, you know, I think now they're looking at maybe scaling back some of the other stuff we do in there.
**Jdawson**: I don't know.
**Jdawson**: But I got another meeting today with them.
**Tj.shelters**: Okay.
**Tj.shelters**: And even, even with scaling back, I mean, even looking at scaling back, what they would have to, from what it sounds like they'd have to cut the chargers in half, correct?
**Jdawson**: Or yeah, if we cut the chargers in half, then yeah, then they can make everything work.
**Jdawson**: Or at least we need to save at least thousand amps somewhere.
**Speaker 3**: By cutting the chargers in half.
**Speaker 3**: Are they.
**Jdawson**: Sorry, what's that?
**Jdawson**: What was that?
**Evin.sisemore**: I think we lost our mid comment.
**Evin.sisemore**: I think.
**Speaker 3**: Sorry, if I can hear me.
**Evin.sisemore**: Yeah, I can.
**Evin.sisemore**: Items.
**Speaker 3**: Oh, I, I said, are they going to be.
**Speaker 3**: If they cut their chargers in half, would they be cutting their trucks in half or would they just be using two trucks per charger?
**Jdawson**: Well, they, they made, they said one thing, which is normally during the year 70% they would have 70 lifts there instead of, or 70% of the equipment there would be used.
**Jdawson**: And then in peak times they just rent the, you know, the other 30% to use for that peak period.
**Jdawson**: So it's not like they wouldn't need the chargers.
**Jdawson**: I don't because then when it's peak period, you wouldn't have a charger for everything.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Speaker 3**: And just in my experience, when customers do that and they don't have the power, they'll.
**Speaker 3**: A lot of times they'll be running the charger with the truck, but they don't even plug it in because they don't have the power.
**Speaker 3**: And then it causes all their batteries to fail because they're not getting proper charge and proper equalization.
**Speaker 3**: So.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, but I know that's not your problem.
**Speaker 3**: A few years down the line, I just see a recipe for disaster.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, well, I think it's starting to, you know, for whatever reason, they thought they had enough power to do what they wanted to do, and maybe now they're starting to see that it won't.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Evin.sisemore**: Right.
**Jdawson**: That's all.
**Jdawson**: Like, the only thing I can figure is either like, you know, your hive system or again, another load sharing that would not be as sophisticated, but simply something that controls the power that would go to say, three chargers or four chargers.
**Tj.shelters**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Reducing it to one circuit.
**Tj.shelters**: Where I was looking at that.
**Tj.shelters**: I mean that now you're going to have it like, like Evan was mentioning a production issue.
**Tj.shelters**: You know, you're still going to have.
**Tj.shelters**: It's still.
**Tj.shelters**: You may not need the number of trucks then, which would reduce product, which would produce productivity for the facility if you go that route.
**Tj.shelters**: I was thinking about that a little bit.
**Jdawson**: Spoke to TJ does like.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: If they're running two shifts though, and that third shift, even if they had four, four pieces of equipment plugged to it at 25% in eight hours, would it be able to charge them back up?
**Jdawson**: I'm sure they wouldn't be completely dead, but at least would they overnight be charged even at a quarter of the.
**Jdawson**: I guess the power going to each one.
**Jdawson**: There's like four hooked up to one heater.
**Evin.sisemore**: That.
**Evin.sisemore**: It's a dedicated charger per truck.
**Evin.sisemore**: One charger won't have four cables where, where four trucks can charge off of one charger.
**Jdawson**: Well, what.
**Jdawson**: I'm, I'm.
**Jdawson**: I'm just saying this because, you know, I don't know if I thought they made it for these, but for like EV chargers for your car, you know, if you got the Tesla charger that'll charge everything in a couple hours, that requires one dedicated 60amp feed.
**Jdawson**: But they.
**Jdawson**: We put this system in on a condo I built a couple years ago where we needed 30 EV charger spaces, but we didn't have the power in the building.
**Jdawson**: So we put these load sharing Devices in that would sense if how many cars were plugged in and which one was charging.
**Jdawson**: And so if there was only two cars charging, it would send out 50%.
**Jdawson**: So instead of taking two hours to charge, it would take four hours for each of the cars to charge.
**Jdawson**: Or if there was four cars hooked up, they'd each get 25%.
**Jdawson**: It would just take longer to charge.
**Jdawson**: But they would always, you know, have the ability to get some sort of charge at any time.
**Jdawson**: And so that allowed us, you know, we had 300amp or 600amps of service.
**Jdawson**: We were able to run 10 circuits out and feed 40 chargers instead of just only being able to have 10 chargers.
**Evin.sisemore**: Yeah, Greg, there's something out there in the world that exists.
**Evin.sisemore**: I forgot, I saw it, I forget who does it.
**Speaker 3**: They're like GSE chargers.
**Evin.sisemore**: Yeah, there's a.
**Evin.sisemore**: We'll look at, we'll look at that option and try to bring something back to you, Jesse, because I think there is something out there with a charging partner that does it.
**Evin.sisemore**: I just gotta remember who it is, Craig.
**Evin.sisemore**: So we look that up.
**Tj.shelters**: I think I, I think I know Brian Crummy has something something like that.
**Evin.sisemore**: Yeah, so we'll find that.
**Jdawson**: Because I'm thinking that would be a selling point to them when they know for eight months out of the year they're only going to have 70% of the equipment in there anyways.
**Jdawson**: And so then they can just spread those out.
**Jdawson**: So then say some of them would get full charge all the time and others would get, you know, 50, 50, you know, overnight.
**Jdawson**: So that might be something they're more comfortable with.
**Speaker 3**: And as long as we have something in writing too, with the customers, we just want to make sure that we're completely transparent that this is a temporary solution that will work for them.
**Speaker 3**: But they need to be like.
**Speaker 3**: And also, if we're looking at how long we're going to lease the trucks, we probably should take the truck leases down too, or prepare to have two batteries during that lifetime of the truck, which then that expense goes up.
**Speaker 3**: So we just have to, we, our thing is we want it to be a long term customer.
**Speaker 3**: And we work with them at other places too, through forklift dealers.
**Speaker 3**: But we want to make sure that we don't sell them a solution that's gonna make everything fail in a few years.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah, understood.
**Jdawson**: And like that's the thing, like they're starting out, I don't know, it's maybe just a five year lease.
**Jdawson**: It may turn into 20.
**Jdawson**: So they would maybe even do Something temporary or not temporary, but rather not the full solution.
**Jdawson**: But if we had.
**Jdawson**: If we knew we had a year, then we would just bring in another, you know, service, or else, you know, getting them.
**Jdawson**: That's what I'm saying.
**Jdawson**: Just getting them comfortable with your system, though, is something that would be.
**Evin.sisemore**: So you're how familiar with Siva?
**Evin.sisemore**: And I know you're familiar with them, so I'll just get to my question.
**Evin.sisemore**: The question is Siva is a big company.
**Evin.sisemore**: They buy a lot of probably advanced technology things, automated things to help warehouses move.
**Evin.sisemore**: They do that for a reason.
**Evin.sisemore**: And there's a process they go through to explore and execute on those with the powerhive, you know, to them it's new to us, it's not, of course, it's new to them.
**Evin.sisemore**: And that new technology piece always creates an emotion, right.
**Evin.sisemore**: Of fear.
**Evin.sisemore**: We should be able to overcome that fear very quickly.
**Evin.sisemore**: The question is, the Siba Group, hey, you guys buy this type of stuff all the time, and it makes you way better and way healthier.
**Evin.sisemore**: This Power Hive system is no different.
**Evin.sisemore**: And it absolutely solves every problem you got, including rentals and scaling and everything.
**Evin.sisemore**: It's in the.
**Evin.sisemore**: It's deployed.
**Evin.sisemore**: You got to see it.
**Evin.sisemore**: But how do you guys buy that?
**Evin.sisemore**: How can we go through that process very quickly?
**Evin.sisemore**: Because otherwise.
**Evin.sisemore**: Otherwise we're going to be patch, hatching something together, right?
**Evin.sisemore**: That it's going to be complicated.
**Evin.sisemore**: We need.
**Evin.sisemore**: If that's.
**Evin.sisemore**: If they don't want to do Power High firm, we got to get out to the site.
**Evin.sisemore**: We got to start looking and doing some work and finding some other options.
**Evin.sisemore**: But they're going to have a challenge either way if they don't do the Hive.
**Evin.sisemore**: And I'm not trying to push the Hive on it, but it's the solution solves the problem.
**Jdawson**: It's.
**Tj.shelters**: It's going to become an operational challenge.
**Tj.shelters**: I think, too, with managing with, you know, as far as, you know, with.
**Tj.shelters**: With their pieces of equipment.
**Tj.shelters**: Now you got to manage to make sure those batteries are getting fully charged.
**Tj.shelters**: So from an operation standpoint, from a warranty standpoint, from now you got.
**Tj.shelters**: Now they've got another issue to deal with.
**Jdawson**: So you're saying, like, if you don't fully charge those batteries, you can't just partially charge them all the time.
**Evin.sisemore**: You can, you know, and we.
**Evin.sisemore**: It's the good news of our vendor cycle count matters.
**Evin.sisemore**: So you.
**Evin.sisemore**: When you get into these warranty documents, if they buy somebody else's lithium, some people count a cycle as a full discharge and a full charge.
**Evin.sisemore**: Even a few opportunity charges.
**Evin.sisemore**: It's, it's a cycle of amps through a battery.
**Evin.sisemore**: Other companies count it as every time you plug it in, that's one cycle.
**Evin.sisemore**: So some companies will say, oh look, we've got a 5,000 cycle eight year warranty.
**Evin.sisemore**: But every time you plug it in, when you, when you do amp consumption, amp consumption, it's really not a 5,000 cycle warranty.
**Evin.sisemore**: It's not an eight year warranty.
**Evin.sisemore**: These are the gimmicks that we kind of face all day.
**Evin.sisemore**: We don't talk in those terms.
**Evin.sisemore**: So we tell you it's 4,000 cycles, it's 4,000 battery cycles, which is, you know, if it's a thousand amp hour battery, you know, we don't want to discharge it under 20.
**Evin.sisemore**: So it's really 800ampere hours consumed by the battery.
**Evin.sisemore**: One cycle right down, up, it's only one cycle.
**Evin.sisemore**: Whether it's, you know, goes down to 50, then charge 70, then down to 40, then charge 60, it's about that 800ampere hour consumption, one cycle.
**Evin.sisemore**: Yeah, so, but, and you do, you do want to cycle the batteries, you do want to try to get them fully charged.
**Evin.sisemore**: Lithium's pretty robust in that.
**Evin.sisemore**: So Greg's staying operational.
**Evin.sisemore**: What's going to happen is their operators will run out of power because we're charging a certain way.
**Evin.sisemore**: They're just going to stop working and then they're going to go plug it in.
**Evin.sisemore**: And then if the charger is not available because another truck's plugged in, they're just going to park the truck and go take a smoke or do whatever else they do.
**Evin.sisemore**: And they're going to have challenges with productivity.
**Evin.sisemore**: We see that all the time.
**Evin.sisemore**: And they're going to have to manage through that.
**Evin.sisemore**: It's difficult for them and then it costs them a lot of money because if an operator, most burn rates are 30, 35 an hour, you'll have, God, probably 5, 10, 15 minutes of shift per employee jacking around with power.
**Evin.sisemore**: And that's wasted time.
**Evin.sisemore**: It's not moving product, which I mean again, and I guess the question is if we're, we seem aligned on the hive because it solves this specific problem.
**Evin.sisemore**: Is there a way to talk to Siva in a fashion that says, I'm not trying to bug you, Siva, but you guys are putting all this complex stuff in, you're automating all these things.
**Evin.sisemore**: You have all these systems, you seem afraid of this, that does all those things when it comes to material handling power, it's deployed, it's real.
**Evin.sisemore**: They'll bring you to the customer tomorrow.
**Evin.sisemore**: So who.
**Evin.sisemore**: How do you guys justify buying all that?
**Evin.sisemore**: And why can we apply that philosophy to this system?
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Let me talk.
**Jdawson**: Let me talk to and just see who's actually their new technology person, you know, that probably reviews the new things that are out there, or that's why I just got to find the right person.
**Evin.sisemore**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: You know, because most people we talk to, it is with the construction delivery folks that.
**Evin.sisemore**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Get it done.
**Speaker 3**: And we can also get them on the phone with customers as references.
**Speaker 3**: We can take them to a facility, which we typically don't do until it's approved on one end.
**Speaker 3**: But since we're having to speed, all that would have to be speeding everything up.
**Speaker 3**: We can, you know, do some things out of order, too.
**Speaker 3**: But it's a newer technology, but it's been.
**Speaker 3**: It was tested for years before it went out.
**Speaker 3**: It's been in the market for over three years.
**Speaker 3**: We have over, you know, close to 200,000, like, reloads.
**Speaker 3**: It's in going.
**Speaker 3**: So the technology has been proven.
**Speaker 3**: And I think that if you talk to any of our customers who have it.
**Speaker 3**: I just talked to one the other day, and before the Hive, they were at 8.9 fix per hour on average per person.
**Speaker 3**: And then after the Hive, it moved up to 10.1.
**Speaker 3**: So we have so many different customers that have those stories after the Hives, so.
**Speaker 3**: And they'd love to share them.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And again, I'm not a salesman, and I don't.
**Jdawson**: I'm not an expert on your system either, so I would definitely build their facility.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I would set some up.
**Jdawson**: Once I find if I can get an audience with that person, I can set it up so you guys.
**Jdawson**: Because you can do your.
**Jdawson**: Your presentation.
**Jdawson**: And, like, I'm not.
**Jdawson**: That's.
**Jdawson**: Again, that's.
**Evin.sisemore**: That's not my.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, no, I'm not a salesman, so.
**Evin.sisemore**: Well, but what you are is smart at what you're doing, and you're trying to solve a problem.
**Evin.sisemore**: You found a solution that solves a problem, that they're not going to call you back and say, what the hell did you do, Jesse?
**Evin.sisemore**: Right.
**Evin.sisemore**: Now, conversely, if we do this a different way, there's a real potential.
**Evin.sisemore**: They call you back and say, this doesn't work.
**Evin.sisemore**: You can say, well, I know.
**Evin.sisemore**: I told you, like, I tried to warn you.
**Evin.sisemore**: It doesn't work.
**Evin.sisemore**: Yeah, but we're experiencing pain and we can't do this.
**Evin.sisemore**: You should have done that.
**Evin.sisemore**: But the Hive, that definitely won't happen.
**Evin.sisemore**: And we're absolutely happy to go through that with Siva.
**Evin.sisemore**: If, if you can get them interested with that new technology person, I think it would be beneficial because again, we could, we could go to our critical team and talk about energy needs and a small, you know, energy storage system that can sit outside the building.
**Evin.sisemore**: But again, now you're going to talk 500,000 to $2 million for an energy distribution system so that they have more power, which is additional cost.
**Evin.sisemore**: And then you might as well buy the high from a cost perspective because you'll spend more money on that than you would on the Hive.
**Jdawson**: That's too.
**Jdawson**: Like, when I look at that building, you know, the way they have it laid out, like they're gonna have to go all the way to one side or other of a million square foot warehouse, which is a tremendous amount of time for just people to walk, versus, like if we change it now, I would stick that thing right in the middle somewhere, right side of the other so that, you know, it's central to everything.
**Jdawson**: And, and that's why I was asked, I don't know if I asked, but like, what is the cost difference?
**Jdawson**: Like if they put two of them in and you know, you were talking about needing, was it four racks of batteries?
**Jdawson**: About three rack.
**Evin.sisemore**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Or three or four in one spot.
**Jdawson**: Like, even if they wanted to have one on each side, is the arm the biggest expense of that whole thing?
**Jdawson**: Or they could put two arms in and, and then two racks on each side so that again, they wouldn't be driving all the way across the warehouse or all the way.
**Evin.sisemore**: Yeah.
**Evin.sisemore**: That second arm, you're probably adding about 350,000 of additional costs.
**Evin.sisemore**: The real expense is the batteries.
**Evin.sisemore**: And that's again, our battery is, I'll call it mid tiered price compared to all lithium.
**Evin.sisemore**: Right.
**Evin.sisemore**: It's not Chinese cheap, but it's also not the high end expensive brands that we see at times.
**Evin.sisemore**: So it's.
**Evin.sisemore**: It's right in the middle.
**Evin.sisemore**: So when they go quote other lithiums, that price per kilowatt hour from a battery is going to be very competitive from us.
**Evin.sisemore**: It's not the same.
**Evin.sisemore**: So they're going to spend that money, period.
**Evin.sisemore**: Right now the question is, now it's an infrastructure roi.
**Evin.sisemore**: Is the infrastructure for the Hive more affordable than the infrastructure for all the electrical drops?
**Jdawson**: Everything.
**Jdawson**: The chargers, if they get rid of all those chargers, like how much do they typically cost?
**Jdawson**: Or is that just something that comes with the equipment?
**Evin.sisemore**: About five grand of charger, because we got to average of that.
**Evin.sisemore**: Right.
**Evin.sisemore**: So they're going to eliminate that.
**Evin.sisemore**: And then the electrician themselves is going to physically run all those drops.
**Evin.sisemore**: There's a cost to that.
**Evin.sisemore**: That again, Instead of running three drops, there's however many.
**Evin.sisemore**: 80.
**Evin.sisemore**: I can't remember the numbers.
**Jdawson**: Just for the chargers.
**Evin.sisemore**: Correct.
**Tj.shelters**: About 120.
**Evin.sisemore**: Right.
**Tj.shelters**: So 60 on each side.
**Jdawson**: 26, I think was 126 total.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Speaker 3**: Did you say on two sides of the building figure for the, that you already have for the electrical.
**Speaker 3**: Do you know how much that is?
**Jdawson**: I have some budget, some budget numbers.
**Jdawson**: But it's, it's millions of dollars to run all that power.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Evin.sisemore**: And all the condoms pay for your hive.
**Evin.sisemore**: Yeah.
**Evin.sisemore**: And I think, I think that's where I definitely understand why SEBA says what they, what they said.
**Evin.sisemore**: I literally went to Atlanta.
**Evin.sisemore**: We were demoing one at a very large cold storage customer who struggles to change the way they do things.
**Evin.sisemore**: And they're very cautious and they have many stakeholders in the buying process.
**Evin.sisemore**: And so it was just neat to go sit down there and see some of the folks that were very, I'll call them combative at first and resistant to change.
**Evin.sisemore**: Stop fighting about it.
**Evin.sisemore**: Right.
**Evin.sisemore**: And opening up to saying, you know what?
**Evin.sisemore**: Actually.
**Evin.sisemore**: Yeah.
**Evin.sisemore**: And then talking to the operators, you know that what they told us in cold storage is with the amps we consume, we'll.
**Evin.sisemore**: We'll actually reload more lithium batteries and it's not going to be efficient.
**Evin.sisemore**: And that's not true because lithium is more efficient.
**Evin.sisemore**: And then we talk to the operators, they have five year old batteries, they love it because they cut the reloads in half and they get paid to scan.
**Evin.sisemore**: They're cons.
**Evin.sisemore**: That's how they get bonused.
**Evin.sisemore**: And the operators were happy because now I can go scan more product.
**Evin.sisemore**: Right.
**Evin.sisemore**: And move it, move from the shelf to a semi.
**Evin.sisemore**: And they're going to measure that as well.
**Evin.sisemore**: And it's the productivity piece there is going to be huge when they get that data, which is great.
**Evin.sisemore**: And again, they're like all the concerns they had, they're like, we're not concerned at all.
**Evin.sisemore**: And we've had a few problems with it because it was a different configuration.
**Evin.sisemore**: It's only one cabinet, it's in a tighter spot.
**Evin.sisemore**: The arm's undulating.
**Evin.sisemore**: Weird.
**Evin.sisemore**: We had to update software so there was some downtime, but we got through all that in a matter of a couple days.
**Evin.sisemore**: And I thought they were going to moan and complain about that and they're like, no, you know, it had some flubs.
**Evin.sisemore**: But overall, man, it's pretty wild how well, it works.
**Evin.sisemore**: I'm like, good.
**Evin.sisemore**: We don't have to fight about that, which was nice.
**Evin.sisemore**: So I think if we can get Siva to look at that, it won't be so scary once they see it and understand it.
**Evin.sisemore**: Especially when you say, look, I can save you a million dollars plus by not buying chargers and by not running electrical.
**Evin.sisemore**: So we'll be able to pay for at least half the system just on some of the stuff I'll cut out of the budget.
**Jdawson**: What were the.
**Jdawson**: When you said.
**Jdawson**: You said they had some hiccups.
**Jdawson**: Like, what were they just the arm so not wanting to work.
**Evin.sisemore**: Yeah.
**Evin.sisemore**: When we.
**Evin.sisemore**: The benefit of the system is it's very easy to deploy for an automated system.
**Evin.sisemore**: Everybody thinks it's hard, but it's in a robot cell that has a certain footprint.
**Evin.sisemore**: So those cabinets are designed to be X far away from the arm because of the way the arm pivots and whatnot.
**Evin.sisemore**: This area we had to put it in the cabinet is actually closer to the arm than normal.
**Evin.sisemore**: So as it was grabbing the battery and swinging around to get to the truck, the way it's supposed to move, it kind of hung itself up a couple times.
**Evin.sisemore**: So we did.
**Evin.sisemore**: We just updated that, rewrote it so that it doesn't undulate that way anymore.
**Evin.sisemore**: That solved the problem.
**Evin.sisemore**: Then there was one truck that every time it took a battery out, the cradle was shifting.
**Evin.sisemore**: We couldn't figure out what the hell was happening.
**Evin.sisemore**: Well, they have battery rollers in the truck.
**Evin.sisemore**: Turns out there's two battery rollers broken and out.
**Evin.sisemore**: So the cradle wasn't sitting flat.
**Evin.sisemore**: They put new rollers in, and now that problem's gone away because it was just the one truck.
**Evin.sisemore**: So those are the two things that we found and updated very quickly.
**Evin.sisemore**: And now there's.
**Evin.sisemore**: There's no issues, which they're happy with.
**Evin.sisemore**: So, again, I think if you look at it, it's not a very scary thing.
**Evin.sisemore**: It's very easy to deploy, and, man, it makes a lot of sense, and it'll save you money.
**Evin.sisemore**: And then, you know, while you're doing that, we'll go look at this load distribution philosophy when it comes to charging, metering the energy.
**Evin.sisemore**: We'll figure out that that's an option as well.
**Jdawson**: Okay, that'd be good.
**Jdawson**: I'll follow up with you after my next conversation with them and see what.
**Jdawson**: See who we need to talk to to actually understand it and how it works.
**Tj.shelters**: Timing wise.
**Tj.shelters**: Jesse, just to confirm, just to clarify.
**Tj.shelters**: So it's September.
**Tj.shelters**: They're looking to move into the Building at the end of September.
**Speaker 3**: Correct.
**Jdawson**: For like a rollout of it.
**Jdawson**: And then.
**Tj.shelters**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Having all the racking done and ready to go.
**Jdawson**: November.
**Evin.sisemore**: So they.
**Tj.shelters**: So they have.
**Tj.shelters**: With all new truck.
**Tj.shelters**: With all new trucks.
**Jdawson**: I believe there happened.
**Jdawson**: They said they had that figured out.
**Jdawson**: So they.
**Jdawson**: They're gonna.
**Jdawson**: It's gonna be all lithium, but they were gonna have the rentals in place until, like, the purchase trucks come in.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: You know, I don't know if they placed that order yet.
**Jdawson**: That I don't know.
**Evin.sisemore**: But yeah, that'd be something to know.
**Evin.sisemore**: I mean, because again, if they're.
**Evin.sisemore**: They may.
**Evin.sisemore**: Because of the way they operate.
**Evin.sisemore**: I mean, if they've cut POS for trucks with lithium batteries, that we're kind of up a creek at that point.
**Evin.sisemore**: I mean, they have to change their philosophy fast because you're.
**Evin.sisemore**: You're gonna have to tell them that's great that you ordered it.
**Evin.sisemore**: I'm working with a company trying to figure out your charger situation.
**Evin.sisemore**: But you probably already ordered the chargers then, too, right?
**Evin.sisemore**: So all this other stuff, you're gonna have to go talk to the forklift folks you ordered it from, and you're gonna have to figured out this distribution thing because you don't have the power supply.
**Evin.sisemore**: So I hope that they know that they haven't ordered that equipment.
**Evin.sisemore**: But if they have, that would be the conversation you have to have with them is, that's great.
**Evin.sisemore**: It's going to show up, but you're not going to have the power.
**Evin.sisemore**: You just don't have it.
**Jdawson**: If they order the equipment, though, can they just cancel the batteries?
**Jdawson**: Oh, yeah, yeah.
**Evin.sisemore**: Yeah.
**Evin.sisemore**: The trucks are the trucks.
**Tj.shelters**: We can make the power hive work with any.
**Tj.shelters**: With any truck truck chassis.
**Tj.shelters**: It's a matter of the power.
**Tj.shelters**: Batteries, chargers.
**Evin.sisemore**: Got to do that.
**Jdawson**: And that's every.
**Jdawson**: You would have a battery for all 126 pieces, or were there certain things that you wouldn't.
**Evin.sisemore**: Power, we'd have from all.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Tj.shelters**: Well, just built.
**Tj.shelters**: We just.
**Tj.shelters**: On that first conversation, we.
**Tj.shelters**: We just designed the cabinet, the battery cabinet based on that truck's compartment size.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Was that.
**Jdawson**: Did your brochure have a size of that cage in it?
**Tj.shelters**: 620 sq ft.
**Tj.shelters**: For the.
**Evin.sisemore**: For the.
**Tj.shelters**: The actual arm, the cage.
**Evin.sisemore**: 24 by 26, I think.
**Evin.sisemore**: Is that right?
**Evin.sisemore**: 24 by 26, yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Tj.shelters**: And that can hold up to five racks, right, T.J.
**Tj.shelters**: we haven't done a.
**Evin.sisemore**: Five rack system, but yeah, it can.
**Evin.sisemore**: And again, it's the.
**Evin.sisemore**: The.
**Evin.sisemore**: The issue is the speed of the arm.
**Evin.sisemore**: It does our average reloads I think 2 minute, 15 seconds.
**Evin.sisemore**: So it can only access X amount of slots.
**Evin.sisemore**: Like if you change the battery every time, like two minutes.
**Jdawson**: Two minutes.
**Evin.sisemore**: Two minutes, two minutes.
**Evin.sisemore**: You know, divide that by an hour, and you can only do so many reloads.
**Evin.sisemore**: That's why that fourth cabinet, technically it would never access it.
**Evin.sisemore**: We did have a customer put a fourth cabinet in because they wanted to spread the cycles out on the batteries.
**Evin.sisemore**: And I haven't seen a customer with that amount of throughput that they.
**Evin.sisemore**: The demand would be there for more than three racks, three cabinets.
**Evin.sisemore**: So.
**Evin.sisemore**: Yeah, but, you know, you may need a full cabinet.
**Speaker 3**: I just did one for 200 with only two racks.
**Speaker 3**: So it just kind of depends when we go in and put the numbers in.
**Tj.shelters**: Type of trucks, order picker style jacks.
**Jdawson**: Okay, I'll follow up with you.
**Speaker 3**: Jackie.
**Speaker 3**: I have a question.
**Speaker 3**: You guys, you know, brought us into this.
**Speaker 3**: We quote a lot of stuff on the back end where we don't even get to see the.
**Speaker 3**: They don't bring us in on the construction side where we can we get as much information as we did from you on the power and stuff up front.
**Speaker 3**: Do you care if we reach out to our contact Ashley, who does the majority of the ordering and cuts the pos, or would you rather us?
**Speaker 3**: I feel like if we could maybe talk to them on both sides, it could help Ashley.
**Jdawson**: Is it Siva?
**Speaker 3**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I don't know her.
**Jdawson**: It.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I mean, if you have a, you know, she's someone you talk to, but I.
**Jdawson**: I don't know what that would hurt.
**Jdawson**: But it's not like the job's a secret.
**Jdawson**: And you would just want to ask her if they've actually ordered.
**Jdawson**: Made the order for their equipment yet.
**Speaker 3**: Well, I would.
**Speaker 3**: I could ask her that, but also just I don't know that she knows about all the infrastructure issues.
**Speaker 3**: So she just kind of orders what everyone knows and she may not know.
**Speaker 3**: She ordered a, you know, a bunch of trucks that aren't going to work right now.
**Speaker 3**: So.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So is she someone you talk to about this system?
**Jdawson**: What does she think of it?
**Speaker 3**: I actually, I talked to her about a month or two ago, and she really liked it.
**Speaker 3**: She's like, oh, my gosh, this is awesome for some of our facilities.
**Speaker 3**: But we were gonna loop back around, so she has seen it, and we were talking more so on.
**Speaker 3**: I was giving her like a lesson on lithium one to one in a facility because she had two different OEMs quoting different things.
**Speaker 3**: So I was just kind of giving her the side by side of what each one and what she needs to look at.
**Jdawson**: But yeah, and you also mentioned something like if the end user is Amazon, like, do they have some input into, like, hey, we, like, we don't train people to use that system.
**Jdawson**: So they would have to also approve doing something other than the normal.
**Jdawson**: And I would think if it improves efficiency, they would want to put it everywhere.
**Evin.sisemore**: It depends on the 3 PL setup.
**Evin.sisemore**: I mean, you know, if Amazon, if Amazon's hiring Siva to be the 3PL, but Amazon would bring in their own equipment.
**Evin.sisemore**: Sometimes they do that, Sometimes they tell three pl I don't care, you're moving our stuff.
**Evin.sisemore**: And like Sibo owns the infrastructure, they own the trucks.
**Evin.sisemore**: So it depends on the setup.
**Evin.sisemore**: If Siba is buying the equipment and they're responsible to move it, Amazon wouldn't necessarily have a say.
**Evin.sisemore**: But if Amazon's the one ordering the equipment, then that.
**Evin.sisemore**: Yeah, that's where they'd have to come in.
**Evin.sisemore**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 3**: I think they'd be more afraid of telling Amazon that their current building might not.
**Jdawson**: Oh yeah.
**Speaker 3**: Or we found a solution that's going to give us more productivity.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I didn't think about that.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, if they're doing all the, if they're moving everything and doing all that, Amazon don't care.
**Evin.sisemore**: No, would care.
**Evin.sisemore**: So.
**Evin.sisemore**: Well, hopefully we can get some traction on that to make your life a little bit easier.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, Give me today the Kyle's guy's name I talked to yesterday, but he's like on west coast time, so it was like 7 o' clock by the time he called me yesterday.
**Jdawson**: So I'll touch base with him again, you know, because I explained to him yesterday, I think he's somewhat new on the, on this side of it as to the issues we got with the power.
**Jdawson**: So, yeah, let me, I'll talk to him today and then we'll follow up either later today or tomorrow and then maybe we reach out to the Ashley girl and see what the status of this order is.
**Evin.sisemore**: Yeah, yeah, it's just let them know that any, any objection is going to happen.
**Evin.sisemore**: Not going to work because the system fits all.
**Evin.sisemore**: Well, what if we move in five years?
**Evin.sisemore**: Great.
**Evin.sisemore**: We can pick it up and move it with you.
**Evin.sisemore**: I mean, hell, I want, I don't have to anchor to the floor.
**Evin.sisemore**: We can put it on a, We've got a portable pad we use.
**Evin.sisemore**: Right.
**Evin.sisemore**: I mean, so yeah, we got, we can, we can cover all that stuff if they, if they're really willing to listen and you can find that person hey, you guys, other stuff in this building is automated.
**Evin.sisemore**: There's a reason you're doing it.
**Evin.sisemore**: This is an automated system.
**Evin.sisemore**: There's a reason you should do it.
**Evin.sisemore**: Mainly because your power constraint, it's going to save you millions on infrastructure.
**Evin.sisemore**: Who do I talk to?
**Evin.sisemore**: A team that does that?
**Evin.sisemore**: Like somebody is measuring that roi.
**Evin.sisemore**: Somebody.
**Evin.sisemore**: Its job is to put that innovation in.
**Evin.sisemore**: Who is it?
**Evin.sisemore**: Can I throw this in front of them?
**Evin.sisemore**: And I think you might get traction that way.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah.
**Evin.sisemore**: I got a.
**Jdawson**: You know, we're doing radial.
**Jdawson**: You probably know who they are.
**Jdawson**: We're doing a couple projects for them and we're adding, I think, like 30 or 30 or 40 chargers to a unit in Indianapolis.
**Jdawson**: We're doing that right now.
**Jdawson**: So it's like too late for that.
**Jdawson**: And then.
**Jdawson**: But coming up, there's a.
**Jdawson**: We're doing a project for Uniqlo out in New Jersey, and that architect, he likes us that we're working with, so he wants to get us in on the front end of another job they have in New York State somewhere.
**Jdawson**: So that's one, like getting in on the design phase of it.
**Evin.sisemore**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And.
**Jdawson**: And being able to bring this solution right off the bat.
**Jdawson**: They'll be all for it.
**Evin.sisemore**: And just, gosh, we talked about.
**Evin.sisemore**: Yeah, New York and West coast, in Philly and Jersey, the, the peak power charges are astronomical.
**Evin.sisemore**: And so that, you know, just by taking that out, they're going to save hundreds of thousands a year.
**Evin.sisemore**: And that's what the customers are seeing.
**Evin.sisemore**: So it's exciting what you can do on the front end from a design, and then you're competitive.
**Evin.sisemore**: You know, you're personally more competitive by bringing that in because nobody else is going to do it.
**Speaker 3**: So.
**Evin.sisemore**: So you're going to cut the infrastructure out and the electrical cost over time.
**Evin.sisemore**: So.
**Jdawson**: No, I look forward to.
**Jdawson**: That's why Brandon, when he gets back.
**Evin.sisemore**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Like, to me, because, like, we already were like, the best in the.
**Jdawson**: In the US at doing the, you know, sprinkler systems, integrating with the.
**Jdawson**: The ASRs, you know, the automatic racking system.
**Jdawson**: So we made a name for ourselves there.
**Jdawson**: If we can bring it in and partner with you guys and, you know, bringing all of our projects to have this power solution.
**Jdawson**: That'd be pretty cool.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Evin.sisemore**: Yes, it would.
**Evin.sisemore**: Really.
**Evin.sisemore**: We love your thought process, Jesse.
**Evin.sisemore**: We do.
**Evin.sisemore**: So.
**Evin.sisemore**: Yeah, let us know what you need.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Very cool.
**Jdawson**: Appreciate it.
**Evin.sisemore**: Thanks, guys.
**Evin.sisemore**: Yeah, thank you, Jesse.
**Jdawson**: Thank you.
**Jdawson**: Bye.
