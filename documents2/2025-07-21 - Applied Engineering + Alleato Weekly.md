## Transcript
**Dmiles**: Sa.
**Dmiles**: Hey everybody.
**Dmiles**: We'll just give it a couple minutes for Mark or Dan to join and then we'll get started.
**Dmiles**: Hey, Alex, did you see Mark or Dan at all on site today?
**Mlehman**: No, but I met with Ron.
**Mlehman**: He's doing the Louisville.
**Mlehman**: Met with him this morning.
**Mlehman**: They're gonna be in there after hours the next couple days running their Cat 6 wires.
**Dmiles**: After hours.
**Dmiles**: Are they going to have access?
**Mlehman**: Yeah, I showed them the lockbox and gave them the combo.
**Dmiles**: I just worry about after hours if they'll have access into the actual building itself.
**Dmiles**: Do we know when it opens and shuts down?
**Mlehman**: He's actually part of the applied team, so they're good.
**Dmiles**: Oh, perfect.
**Dmiles**: Okay, well, we can go ahead and get a couple things started here.
**Dmiles**: Emma and Lydia, thank you for.
**Dmiles**: For joining.
**Lhoran**: Of course.
**Dmiles**: Lydia, if I remember correctly, did you say that you were going on maternity leave or you're doing soon or.
**Lhoran**: I will be probably here in like the next ten weeks or so.
**Dmiles**: Okay.
**Lhoran**: It's.
**Lhoran**: It's with twins.
**Lhoran**: It's kind of up in the air, so we'll see.
**Dmiles**: Right.
**Lhoran**: How well they behave.
**Lhoran**: So.
**Lhoran**: Yeah, that's why Emma and I are on the call.
**Lhoran**: Did you have your new addition?
**Lhoran**: I.
**Dmiles**: We did, yeah.
**Lhoran**: Okay.
**Lhoran**: That's so exciting.
**Dmiles**: He is.
**Dmiles**: He's three weeks old now.
**Lhoran**: Oh.
**Lhoran**: Did you take time off?
**Lhoran**: I don't.
**Dmiles**: Did not miss a call.
**Dmiles**: But we're.
**Dmiles**: It's summer and construction, so we're slammed right now.
**Lhoran**: I know.
**Lhoran**: Well, I feel for you.
**Dmiles**: Yeah.
**Dmiles**: We got a kind of tag team, but I also didn't have to birth the child, so.
**Lhoran**: That's right.
**Lhoran**: That's right.
**Lhoran**: But I'm sure you're helpful, so hopefully you're resting some.
**Dmiles**: My recovery is a little different, but yeah, we're tag teaming it pretty good.
**Dmiles**: It's our first one, so a lot of learning.
**Lhoran**: Yes.
**Lhoran**: You're still forming full sentences, so way to go.
**Dmiles**: Yeah.
**Dmiles**: Yep.
**Ahuettl**: So, okay.
**Dmiles**: So guys, I saw your Emma, I saw your comments that you submitted and that worked out great.
**Dmiles**: The approved is noted and so I already.
**Dmiles**: I created a revision and so we'll get that updated completion for the.
**Dmiles**: Or the completed submittal package for the flooring to you here.
**Ahuettl**: Awesome.
**Dmiles**: Thank you.
**Dmiles**: Then I did.
**Dmiles**: I did see your comment about us just matching as close as possible existing and we'll have to get with applied on that because we're having a hard time finding the carpet.
**Dmiles**: The one we have is kind of a different die lot.
**Dmiles**: It's hard to notice, but we'll just.
**Dmiles**: We'll handle that.
**Dmiles**: I'LL send a note out and we'll try to answer this week.
**Lhoran**: AJ I kind of felt like that was probably coming just in terms of, like, I didn't, we didn't know the date of the original applied, you know, project and that original carpet.
**Lhoran**: So if that's something where, if it's possible, I'm wondering, like, can you salvage anything from demo and maybe the transition happens like maybe under workstations or it's just somewhere not as noticeable.
**Lhoran**: You know what I mean?
**Lhoran**: Like, we're open to creative ideas and if you need a new spec, but I feel like if you have an alternate that probably works color wise, they're, they're probably going to be open to doing something that's an alternate but still looks similar.
**Lhoran**: So I had a feeling that might be the case.
**Lhoran**: Just not knowing the age of the product or the original selections that the dial out would be different at minimum.
**Lhoran**: So.
**Dmiles**: Yeah, I think it, I mean, either way you're going to tell a difference, right?
**Dmiles**: New carpet versus old carpet.
**Dmiles**: And that car's been down, it looks like, for a few years, so it may just be like eventually they replace all the carpet.
**Dmiles**: I don't know.
**Dmiles**: We do have a little bit of owner contingency, so I'll bring that up to them.
**Lhoran**: How.
**Dmiles**: Obviously.
**Dmiles**: Yeah.
**Lhoran**: Is that something you could work in.
**Lhoran**: I was gonna say, is that something you could work into the project?
**Lhoran**: Maybe after this is like a phase two of like the new area gets a new carpet and then, you know, after the project's completed, you know, that could, you could go in and they could do it in other areas.
**Lhoran**: That same new carpet.
**Dmiles**: Yeah, I mean, they're, they have so many guys in there.
**Dmiles**: It'd be a pretty invasive whatever, like.
**Dmiles**: Yeah, well, just to misplace them.
**Lhoran**: Totally.
**Dmiles**: I'll work with them.
**Dmiles**: We'll see.
**Dmiles**: We'll put a pin in it for now, but.
**Dmiles**: Well, I'm gonna try to get an answer and you know, obviously include you guys here this week.
**Lhoran**: Okay.
**Dmiles**: So as far as side updates go, we, we met with applied on Friday morning just to do a, a walk on electrical, make sure we had outlets in the right pretty much squared away.
**Dmiles**: So we went ahead and scheduled our in wall inspection and that starts the, the clock ticking on city of Indianapolis to get out there in the next two days.
**Dmiles**: And if they don't show up in two days, the rule is with Indy is we're okay to go ahead and start covering everything up, which.
**Lhoran**: Oh, really?
**Dmiles**: Obviously.
**Dmiles**: Yeah.
**Dmiles**: Oh, yeah, yeah.
**Dmiles**: Indy is so, so backed up when it Comes to inspection.
**Lhoran**: Inspections.
**Lhoran**: Yeah.
**Dmiles**: I mean, in a job like this.
**Dmiles**: And they turned our permit around so quickly and it's so it's, it's really not on their radar.
**Dmiles**: I don't think so.
**Dmiles**: I would be very surprised, very surprised if an inspector stops by.
**Dmiles**: But that's why we take pictures and use licensed electricians, etc.
**Dmiles**: So we're.
**Dmiles**: Obviously, we wouldn't cover anything up if we didn't feel comfortable.
**Lhoran**: Yeah.
**Dmiles**: So we'll.
**Dmiles**: They do that to keep the schedule moving too.
**Dmiles**: I think they ran into a huge issue with COVID too.
**Dmiles**: I remember Covid.
**Dmiles**: They never.
**Dmiles**: I had like five TI's going on and I didn't have an inspection on one of them the whole time.
**Lhoran**: Yeah, well, fine by us.
**Lhoran**: It's whatever works for you also.
**Dmiles**: Right?
**Dmiles**: So no matter what, barring, I mean, I know there's going to be no issue.
**Dmiles**: You know, we'll start covering up walls here, here come Wednesday.
**Dmiles**: Okay, so we're schedule wise, we're, we're, we're right on schedule, if not a little bit ahead.
**Dmiles**: I told the applied team last week and you guys that we'll start sending out some weekly look aheads here once we start getting more into the finishes.
**Dmiles**: That's when finishing that last 20% of the job takes a lot of coordination.
**Dmiles**: So keep everybody on the same page there.
**Dmiles**: That's all I got as far as schedule.
**Dmiles**: Like I said, we'll get those updated submittals for the flooring to you guys all.
**Dmiles**: Are you going to want drawdowns for paint?
**Lhoran**: No, we can do PDF.
**Dmiles**: Okay.
**Dmiles**: Okay, that helps.
**Dmiles**: And then the only other thing I have on my radar is getting that wallpaper sample to you guys.
**Lhoran**: Okay.
**Dmiles**: As far as submittals go, are you tracking on anything else?
**Dmiles**: I saw Emma, your note.
**Dmiles**: Do you guys want.
**Dmiles**: You know I submitted the acoustical ceiling.
**Dmiles**: I know we're just matching.
**Dmiles**: So I saw your note that you weren't really wanting to keep that in your scope, which is totally fine.
**Dmiles**: I just wanted to give you everything.
**Dmiles**: I know.
**Dmiles**: I think I had like six submittals in there, anywhere from studs to drywall.
**Dmiles**: So I just wanted to give you more than what you needed.
**Lhoran**: Yeah.
**Lhoran**: And one of the reasons why we don't want to review that if it match existing one is because we can't tell that exact spec, but two, if the landlord has a specific one, you know, and that's a specific spec, then just making sure that we're getting them their building standard.
**Lhoran**: But those are the reason for the comments.
**Lhoran**: We don't mean to push it off on you, but.
**Dmiles**: No, you're good.
**Dmiles**: Exactly why we say that I like to do more submittals than less.
**Dmiles**: So.
**Dmiles**: Yep.
**Lhoran**: I was going to say I'm seeing on my side for this middle.
**Lhoran**: So we received a date are flooring and millwork and then that miscellaneous one that we send back.
**Lhoran**: So if there's others that come up, just let us know.
**Ahuettl**: Yep.
**Dmiles**: Yeah.
**Dmiles**: I mean doors.
**Dmiles**: Doors and hardware.
**Dmiles**: We're trying to salvage existing.
**Dmiles**: So the only other one on there is.
**Dmiles**: I'll send you guys the farm door that we're doing.
**Dmiles**: They did elect to move forward with that so I have to issue a change order for that to them.
**Dmiles**: And other than that, that's all I have as far as submittals go.
**Dmiles**: See, went through schedule.
**Dmiles**: Went through submittals.
**Dmiles**: Any questions on your guys end for me?
**Lhoran**: No, not on ours.
**Dmiles**: Alex, you got anything?
**Mlehman**: Nope.
**Dmiles**: You're.
**Mlehman**: You're nailing it.
**Dmiles**: Hey Jesse Dawson.
**Dmiles**: I see you on here.
**Dmiles**: Any questions, concerns?
**Mlehman**: I'm good.
**Dmiles**: Alrighty guys.
**Dmiles**: Well, this is a short one and Alex, just try to.
**Dmiles**: Obviously applied engineering team was busy which is totally fine.
**Dmiles**: That's why we take these meeting notes.
**Dmiles**: You want to try and find Mark, just let them know.
**Dmiles**: Think.
**Dmiles**: As far as our questions for them, we.
**Dmiles**: You saw I sent the RFI out for what we're going to do with those three vavs and Lydia, I didn't.
**Dmiles**: I didn't include the parallel team on that because that's pretty specific to what applied ones.
**Dmiles**: Yeah.
**Dmiles**: Just for clarity, we're having an issue with the power going to three of the current VAVs.
**Dmiles**: We may have to change and so right now we have single phase and we may have to go to.
**Dmiles**: To three phase to accommodate the.
**Lhoran**: For zoning or What?
**Dmiles**: Well so.
**Dmiles**: So one, so VAV 12 and 15, they call out for a 10 kilowatt VAV.
**Dmiles**: All we have from our manufacturer that they come up with is a 9.4 kilowatt VAV.
**Dmiles**: So they lose just a couple BTUs on that.
**Lhoran**: Right.
**Dmiles**: Which applied said they don't think there's going to be an issue.
**Dmiles**: However on I think it's number eight they call for a 14 kilowatt vav.
**Dmiles**: Well all that's there now is like a 9 kilowatt and all we have is single phase 208 going to it.
**Dmiles**: So we'll either have to split it up and do two vavs to accommodate that bigger area or we'll have to run new power to it.
**Lhoran**: So yeah, they're pretty sensitive on the.
**Lhoran**: On that part because it's not conditioned well currently.
**Dmiles**: Right, right.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah, they are.
**Dmiles**: And so I just.
**Dmiles**: With those two options, I just want to see what they want us to do.
**Dmiles**: I know Alex is going to do a little digging with our electrician on site to see if we have three phase available.
**Lhoran**: Yeah, I was going to say, is that a manufacturer specific issue or is it just kind of across the board?
**Lhoran**: They're asking for something you can't get.
**Dmiles**: It seems.
**Dmiles**: It seems to be across the board because, you know, Swift Air has multiple manufacturers that they can go to.
**Dmiles**: And so for this specific one that they spec in the plans, we just have a couple different options.
**Dmiles**: So we're waiting for a little bit of guidance on Applied's end, but I just got the RFI to him this morning.
**Dmiles**: They're gonna get on it pretty quick, but other than that, everything is moving smoothly.
**Ahuettl**: Okay.
**Mlehman**: Yeah, Mark's actually already responded to that in an email.
**Mlehman**: I'm gonna get with Dean and we'll do some digging and some panels and see if we can find some space.
**Dmiles**: There's definitely.
**Dmiles**: There's got to be 3.3phase in one of those electrical rooms.
**Mlehman**: Yeah, they're 50amp breakers though, so they're going to take up quite a bit of space in those panels.
**Dmiles**: Okay, well, we'll get it figured out.
**Lhoran**: That's what it is.
**Lhoran**: Yeah.
**Dmiles**: Yeah.
**Lhoran**: Okay, well, thanks for keeping it running.
**Ahuettl**: Yep.
**Ahuettl**: Yep.
**Dmiles**: Thank you, guys.
**Lhoran**: Talk to you later.
**Lhoran**: Bye.
**Dmiles**: All right, bye.
