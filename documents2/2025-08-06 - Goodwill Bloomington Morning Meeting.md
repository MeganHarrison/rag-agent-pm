**Jdawson**: Hey, Jack said he's going to join.
**Speaker 3**: Sam.
**Jdawson**: Morning, Jack.
**Bclymer**: Hey, morning, y'.
**Speaker 3**: All.
**Bclymer**: Sorry.
**Jcurtin**: What's going on, Jack?
**Jcurtin**: What do you need from us today?
**Jcurtin**: Nick's working on finishing up that RFI getting with the structural engineer for that block wall in the back.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: I was talking to them.
**Jcurtin**: I don't know why they can't just build that wall up and let that support those bar joists.
**Jcurtin**: If they build that.
**Jcurtin**: You know, the new wall that goes all the way back to the new loading dock entry like that should be able to support the bar joist if it's just temporary.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, because the wall is going to come all the way down, so that.
**Bclymer**: That should support it.
**Bclymer**: Oh, is.
**Bclymer**: Is.
**Bclymer**: Do you think there's an option from Maria.
**Bclymer**: Maria at all that.
**Bclymer**: And I say Maria because I know yesterday you.
**Bclymer**: You mentioned Jerrica.
**Jcurtin**: This is a different job.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so it is Maria, I guess.
**Jcurtin**: Nick.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: That's the instructional engineer.
**Bclymer**: Is.
**Bclymer**: Is there an opportunity for us to, like, not continue with the wall that's out front that comes down that.
**Bclymer**: That lintel holds?
**Bclymer**: And with.
**Bclymer**: Because with.
**Bclymer**: If we.
**Bclymer**: Let's just say we get rid of that wall, then we don't have to worry about shoring.
**Bclymer**: But you're saying it may temporarily hold the joists.
**Bclymer**: But what he's worried about is there's a lot of cantilever left over on the joists where that wall is.
**Bclymer**: So he's worried that maybe it's.
**Bclymer**: There's too much of a joist overhang that.
**Bclymer**: That shoring would have to actually go.
**Bclymer**: Like, either way, he's going to need to shore the joists to fix that corner.
**Bclymer**: And put that new block there and take it back a block and a half and put.
**Bclymer**: And put new block and fill it with grout.
**Bclymer**: But if we could discontinue that overhang that's out front, then it would save us a lot of time.
**Bclymer**: And we just basically wrap framing and have just a really high ceiling up in front of the overhang.
**Bclymer**: And we don't have.
**Bclymer**: You know, if we leave that, there's.
**Jcurtin**: Nothing to support the bar joist we currently have shored up.
**Jcurtin**: Unless we build that above the opening.
**Bclymer**: Even if we.
**Bclymer**: We keep the.
**Bclymer**: Like, if we keep that kick out and then run that beam across.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, but what's that?
**Jcurtin**: What kick out?
**Jcurtin**: Are you talking about the kick out.
**Bclymer**: That we've been like, hey, have them stop and not add any more block to that kick out?
**Bclymer**: Like, if we keep that there.
**Bclymer**: Our thing was like, okay, well, maybe Maria is worried about.
**Jcurtin**: She.
**Bclymer**: She wanted to do an overhang up high because of the clearance for the semi to back into.
**Bclymer**: Well, with the kick out There, we have 11, four, and the clearance that a semi needs is eight and a half.
**Bclymer**: So we still have wiggle room from.
**Jcurtin**: Where, like, semis are taller than 8 foot.
**Bclymer**: No, I'm talking about in.
**Bclymer**: In.
**Bclymer**: In width.
**Bclymer**: Like how.
**Jcurtin**: Again, it's cramped for them getting the semi in there to begin with.
**Jcurtin**: Now we're adding a wall that sticks out two feet.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: It just.
**Bclymer**: The structurally, we have to find out.
**Jcurtin**: Well, what.
**Jcurtin**: What we're doing here is we didn't call her yesterday, which is bad because now we've lost the day for them to look at it and look at the problem and see what the issue is.
**Jcurtin**: So this morning, we need to not mess around anymore.
**Jcurtin**: Find out when she gets in.
**Jcurtin**: And as soon as she's in, we're on this with her to figure out what needs to happen at that corner.
**Jcurtin**: So we need to get the RFI put together, get all the photos, send it to her, and get her to tell us what she wants us to do.
**Jcurtin**: Her to tell us.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, you need shoring or what are we doing to fix that condition on the top?
**Jcurtin**: I don't know if that block was broke before or the demo guys just got crazy and busted up where the embed used to be.
**Jcurtin**: I'm not sure what happened up there.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: I mean, that's on us.
**Jcurtin**: If we're busting up.
**Jcurtin**: That shouldn't have got busted up.
**Jcurtin**: Was it even a filled.
**Jcurtin**: Well, it had to be a filled cell.
**Jcurtin**: They had an embed in it.
**Jcurtin**: Like, I don't know.
**Jcurtin**: What happened that they broke all that up?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I, I couldn't at the time that they were demoing that, we had a, it was a full house, so I didn't really have time to, like, watch them as they were demoing everything.
**Jcurtin**: Well, but the thing is, Jack, like, that wall has been exposed forever.
**Jcurtin**: We got details on the drawings for the bearing, condition of a beam in a masonry wall, and we're waiting until we're building it back before we even bringing it up.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I mean, I, I had walked it with, with David a month ago, and he, he brought up and me, him and Nick got on a call and he talked about how back in bidding stage, he told Andrew to keep the, the turnaround, but then it didn't get to the deconstruction plan.
**Bclymer**: So, like, we had these conversations, like, a month.
**Jcurtin**: We've done nothing with it for a month.
**Jcurtin**: That's the problem.
**Jcurtin**: We're in crunch time now.
**Jcurtin**: We're out of time.
**Jcurtin**: It's on us.
**Jcurtin**: Why we let it wait till now to get resolved?
**Bclymer**: I mean, I, I, he couldn't.
**Bclymer**: He didn't have block to, to do that at all.
**Jcurtin**: Jack, we don't need block on site to get answers to a problem.
**Jcurtin**: We see now it's not.
**Jcurtin**: The condition hasn't changed in a month.
**Jcurtin**: So what?
**Jcurtin**: All I'm trying to tell you is things like this kill a schedule.
**Jcurtin**: When you come to the end, you don't have time anymore.
**Jcurtin**: So now we got to figure it out today and move on with whatever that decision is.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: I hate hearing excuses for why we didn't get it done.
**Jcurtin**: I'm just telling you what happened, where we're at now, and what we got to do is stop wasting time and get the person involved and get it answered.
**Jcurtin**: So that's it.
**Jcurtin**: There's nothing else to discuss on this other than the fact we let this not get resolved for a month.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: And I'm not, It's not.
**Bclymer**: When you say you're explaining, I'm explaining, too.
**Bclymer**: It's not me giving you an excuse.
**Bclymer**: It's me explaining the situation at hand.
**Bclymer**: So you didn't think it was just like, well, we're just gonna throw our hands up and just, like, screw it and we'll think about it later.
**Bclymer**: Like, it was a lot of conversations, and then David had to get specific block made for that corner, and then he was supposed to mobilize weeks ago, but we weren't ready.
**Bclymer**: So now he's out to work on the corner.
**Bclymer**: But we all thought that that overhang was going to be gone, and the only lintel was going to be used at the new overhead door wall.
**Bclymer**: So that's where everybody.
**Jcurtin**: So here, like.
**Jcurtin**: I don't want to talk about this anymore because we're wasting our time here.
**Jcurtin**: I got another meeting that I could join, but.
**Jcurtin**: Jack, get with Jesse R. Show him the drawings.
**Jcurtin**: And then you try to explain to him that you had no idea there was an overhang.
**Bclymer**: Okay?
**Jcurtin**: And I'd like to hear what, Jesse, you think of that.
**Jcurtin**: All right?
**Bclymer**: It's not.
**Bclymer**: Not.
**Bclymer**: Not that I didn't think that there was not supposed to be an overhang there, that we were getting rid of it.
**Bclymer**: All right, I'm done talking about it, too.
**Jcurtin**: Okay?
**Jcurtin**: I gotta join this other meeting.
**Jcurtin**: I'll see it.
**Jcurtin**: I'll get a hold of you, Jack.
