**Sclevenger**: Hey, Sean, good morning.
**Sclevenger**: How are you?
**Cmortensen**: Good.
**Cmortensen**: How are you?
**Sclevenger**: Fine.
**Sclevenger**: Are you hearing me okay this morning?
**Cmortensen**: Yep, I hear you just fine.
**Sclevenger**: Okay.
**Sclevenger**: All right, great.
**Cmortensen**: You know, Corey will be joining, as.
**Sclevenger**: Far as I know.
**Cmortensen**: Okay.
**Sclevenger**: I'm not sure what's on his schedule today, but as far as I know, I know.
**Cmortensen**: He said he may be traveling this week or out.
**Sclevenger**: Yeah, well, I think traveling was internally, but yeah.
**Sclevenger**: Yeah, he was up in Wisconsin.
**Cmortensen**: Okay, we'll give him.
**Cmortensen**: Give him a couple minutes and then we'll get going.
**Sclevenger**: Yeah, he would be pretty key on this.
**Cmortensen**: Well, that's the beauty of typing up some meeting minutes.
**Cmortensen**: And I'll send those out and then we can, you know, shoot them over the recording or something.
**Sclevenger**: Right.
**Sclevenger**: I'll.
**Sclevenger**: I'm gonna give them a quick buzz here.
**Sclevenger**: Hold on, ma' am.
**Sclevenger**: Let's switch out.
**Sclevenger**: Hey, Corey.
**Sclevenger**: Hey, Corey.
**Sclevenger**: Okay, I'm going to assume that he's not because he responded that he's in a meeting now.
**Sclevenger**: I can't hear you.
**Cmortensen**: I was muted.
**Cmortensen**: That's my fault.
**Sclevenger**: Oh, okay.
**Sclevenger**: Okay.
**Sclevenger**: Is there anything.
**Sclevenger**: I'm not sure how much I'll be able to help you with.
**Cmortensen**: No, no, I'll.
**Cmortensen**: I'm just going to share my screen.
**Cmortensen**: We're going to run through.
**Cmortensen**: I'll give you a quick update and we'll make this okay.
**Cmortensen**: Meeting.
**Cmortensen**: Okay.
**Sclevenger**: Okay.
**Sclevenger**: All right.
**Cmortensen**: So I don't know if you saw Sean.
**Cmortensen**: I sent an email to FedEx.
**Cmortensen**: I didn't go into too much detail, but I basically said, hey, you know, here's what the city's making us do.
**Cmortensen**: I just sent this like 20 minutes ago.
**Sclevenger**: Okay.
**Sclevenger**: And I did look through that.
**Sclevenger**: Yes, thank you.
**Cmortensen**: I just said, hey, here's what.
**Cmortensen**: I tried to make it short and sweet.
**Cmortensen**: Here's what they're making us do, you know, and then, and then I'll go in depth, more in depth.
**Cmortensen**: Maybe next week with them when we meet on Tuesday.
**Sclevenger**: Okay.
**Cmortensen**: And then we'll do a bi weekly call.
**Cmortensen**: Did you get any confirmation on.
**Cmortensen**: I think Nissing wants to be included in that call.
**Cmortensen**: Is that okay?
**Cmortensen**: They're not included in our internal call.
**Sclevenger**: Between us, but that's okay.
**Sclevenger**: Sometimes it's just, you know, that many more voices and we don't want their opinion on how we spend our money.
**Sclevenger**: But that's okay.
**Sclevenger**: I saw you included them, so that's fine.
**Cmortensen**: Okay, well, that's fine.
**Cmortensen**: Yeah, I was replying all.
**Cmortensen**: Yeah, you're right.
**Cmortensen**: Sometimes there's too many cooks in the kitchen.
**Cmortensen**: But it's my job to help.
**Cmortensen**: I'll Steer those meetings.
**Cmortensen**: So they'll be short, sweet and to the point.
**Cmortensen**: Okay, sure.
**Sclevenger**: That's fine.
**Sclevenger**: That is fine.
**Cmortensen**: So, an update on the ALDS amendment.
**Cmortensen**: So good news.
**Cmortensen**: Carmel did approve not doing that other entrance.
**Sclevenger**: Right.
**Cmortensen**: With the stipulation of if we do do it, we do do it.
**Cmortensen**: If, if we do have another tenant there and create that opening, we have to do it this way.
**Sclevenger**: Okay.
**Sclevenger**: And I think Rich was very pleased with what he saw.
**Cmortensen**: Yeah, I think honestly, it looks really good, so.
**Sclevenger**: I do too.
**Sclevenger**: I like it.
**Sclevenger**: I like it.
**Cmortensen**: That being said, she, she said she has everything she needs, so, so timeline wise I expect to have.
**Cmortensen**: I mean, it's a short week.
**Cmortensen**: I had some conversations with Christina, who's with the city on.
**Cmortensen**: Oh, when did she send me?
**Cmortensen**: Christina?
**Cmortensen**: Jesse?
**Sclevenger**: She is.
**Cmortensen**: Okay.
**Cmortensen**: Yeah.
**Cmortensen**: So yesterday she said that they have everything they need and so they're going to complete their review shortly.
**Cmortensen**: That.
**Cmortensen**: I don't know if that means a week.
**Cmortensen**: I don't know if that means two days.
**Cmortensen**: I will follow up with her at the beginning of of next week and just check in.
**Sclevenger**: Okay.
**Cmortensen**: But once that amendment gets approved, they will.
**Cmortensen**: Then I saw our plans for construction already got approved on the portal, so I would assume that that permit should follow shortly.
**Cmortensen**: So.
**Sclevenger**: Right.
**Cmortensen**: Probably be right on track for, for middle of June start.
**Cmortensen**: Which is great.
**Sclevenger**: Okay.
**Sclevenger**: Yeah, great.
**Sclevenger**: That is great.
**Cmortensen**: So my only other thing I'm working through now then is the final cost of these separate entrances.
**Cmortensen**: And right now it's looking to just about.
**Cmortensen**: We had that.
**Cmortensen**: Which is, which is great, you know, give or take a thousand.
**Cmortensen**: I, I think I may be able to give you a little money back, which is actually better, but it won't be much looking.
**Cmortensen**: Right Now I'm like 1500 bucks maybe.
**Cmortensen**: So I have a couple guys pricing up the, the masonry because I want to get as good a price as possible and a couple guys pricing up the roofing.
**Cmortensen**: I expect to have those back here today.
**Cmortensen**: I was hoping, but I, I based off of just some plug numbers I did to kind of COVID ourselves, and my masonry was coming in to be around $13,000.
**Cmortensen**: You know, with the added framing, the added glass on the entrance, the roofing, and then there's a little bit more beefy foundations.
**Cmortensen**: It all pretty much cancels out that awning price.
**Sclevenger**: Right.
**Sclevenger**: That's great.
**Sclevenger**: We'll have to.
**Sclevenger**: Of course, as you know, you're working on FedEx's approval.
**Sclevenger**: I don't know what kind of response you expect from them.
**Cmortensen**: Yeah, I mean, they all were.
**Cmortensen**: I unfortunately they don't really have a choice.
**Cmortensen**: I mean.
**Sclevenger**: Okay.
**Sclevenger**: Right, right.
**Cmortensen**: I'm gonna, I'm.
**Cmortensen**: That's what I'm gonna tell them.
**Cmortensen**: I think it looks sharper.
**Cmortensen**: You know, I'll walk through the.
**Cmortensen**: I think they were paying for the awning.
**Cmortensen**: Right.
**Cmortensen**: So they may question costs.
**Cmortensen**: And if they do, I'm going to.
**Cmortensen**: We'll, we'll powwow about that.
**Cmortensen**: I don't know your thoughts, but, you know, they, they have a signed lease.
**Cmortensen**: We're going to give them what the city wants for, for what we promised.
**Cmortensen**: And so it's kind of out of their hands.
**Sclevenger**: Right, right, right.
**Sclevenger**: Yeah.
**Sclevenger**: Okay.
**Sclevenger**: That's something we'll have to think about.
**Sclevenger**: Yeah, they'll probably come back on that.
**Cmortensen**: Whoa.
**Cmortensen**: I'm happy to tell them it costs more that way.
**Cmortensen**: They can pay more.
**Cmortensen**: Right.
**Cmortensen**: So.
**Sclevenger**: Yeah, there you go.
**Cmortensen**: I'll definitely do that.
**Sclevenger**: There you go.
**Cmortensen**: But.
**Sclevenger**: Well, we'll have to see.
**Sclevenger**: Yeah, but there they wanted an entrance, so maybe we can justify that by saying, no, we can't drop the ramp because we are.
**Sclevenger**: We've really kind of cut it down.
**Cmortensen**: Right.
**Sclevenger**: As about as far as we can go.
**Cmortensen**: Yeah.
**Sclevenger**: Okay.
**Cmortensen**: Well, I'm, I'm hoping to be able to give you some money back so that, that should help you guys a little more.
**Cmortensen**: So I just, I, I need to finalize these costs and then, and then we can go from there.
**Cmortensen**: Okay.
**Sclevenger**: Okay.
**Sclevenger**: Okay.
**Sclevenger**: Good enough.
**Sclevenger**: Good enough.
**Cmortensen**: But, but it, it's looking optimistic.
**Sclevenger**: Yeah, Yeah, I agree.
**Sclevenger**: I agree.
**Sclevenger**: And to get this going and off the ground.
**Sclevenger**: So I'll be excited to keep moving forward.
**Cmortensen**: Yep.
**Cmortensen**: So I have.
**Cmortensen**: Alex is listening in here.
**Cmortensen**: He's going to be our superintendent, so he'll be eyes and ears on site every day as construction goes on.
**Cmortensen**: I, obviously, I live like five minutes from the site in Carmel, so.
**Sclevenger**: Okay.
**Cmortensen**: I'll be popping in periodically throughout the week.
**Cmortensen**: If you could just connect me with that site contact when you get the chance.
**Sclevenger**: Okay.
**Cmortensen**: We can start getting everything set up with him as far as access to the site.
**Cmortensen**: And then next week when we meet, hopefully we'll have some answers on the permit and we'll have.
**Cmortensen**: Okay, here's the day we're starting and then we'll go through the construction.
**Cmortensen**: Construction schedule in more depth.
**Sclevenger**: Okay.
**Sclevenger**: Now I will tell you.
**Sclevenger**: So I reached out to the store about access and he said the store opens at six and they have people coming in at five o' clock so you won't have any issues getting in.
**Sclevenger**: But I will give you his contact in case you're there.
**Sclevenger**: And the door's not locked or the door is locked or something, and you need in.
**Cmortensen**: Perfect.
**Cmortensen**: That works out great then.
**Sclevenger**: Yeah.
**Sclevenger**: Yeah.
**Cmortensen**: Okay.
**Cmortensen**: Yeah, our guys usually.
**Cmortensen**: I mean, working hours six to six, like I said, but project like this, they're probably not showing up till 6:45.
**Sclevenger**: Okay?
**Cmortensen**: So.
**Sclevenger**: Okay.
**Sclevenger**: Okay.
**Cmortensen**: Okay.
**Sclevenger**: Got it.
**Cmortensen**: Well, that's all I have then.
**Cmortensen**: Short meeting.
**Cmortensen**: And I'll get these costs put together and sent over to you guys as soon as I have them, okay?
**Sclevenger**: Okay.
