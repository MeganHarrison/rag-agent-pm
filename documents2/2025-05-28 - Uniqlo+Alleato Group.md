## Transcript
**Aelkarrimy**: Hey, everybody.
**Bclymer**: I think.
**Aelkarrimy**: Are we missing anyone to get started?
**Aelkarrimy**: Joe should be joining soon.
**Jdawson**: Suke's on.
**Kevin.ly**: You.
**Mparsons**: Suke.
**Jdawson**: Is Kevin joining this call?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, he will.
**Mparsons**: Maybe.
**Jdawson**: I'm still on the bus, so I'm.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Really sorry about that.
**Bclymer**: Sa.
**Jdawson**: Suka, is it safe to get started?
**Mparsons**: Yes, please.
**Mparsons**: We can start now.
**Jdawson**: Jesse, how do you want to do this?
**Jdawson**: You want to go through, like, meeting minutes?
**Jdawson**: First an agenda, and then we'll go through the presentation.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah, the.
**Aelkarrimy**: I apologize.
**Aelkarrimy**: Do we have any previous meeting minutes we want to go through?
**Mparsons**: I just sent over the agenda and the group text if you can open it.
**Kevin.ly**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Aelkarrimy**: Well, Debba, let's see here.
**Aelkarrimy**: I'm going to share my screen.
**Aelkarrimy**: Get through this.
**Aelkarrimy**: So we got here first, item permitting.
**Aelkarrimy**: I know we've talked to the lady at the city and she's got some sick guys out, but did we get a date talking to them?
**Aelkarrimy**: She still wouldn't give us a date on getting the permit, but that shouldn't not going to affect us from putting our temp fence in material status.
**Aelkarrimy**: Keba, you want to update on that?
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Mparsons**: So we have ordered material for all of the.
**Mparsons**: The electric and also the fence.
**Mparsons**: And I believe the fence is almost on site, so we should be introduced to install that on the fourth.
**Bryan.wagar**: Was that.
**Bryan.wagar**: Was that date pushed?
**Bschwartz**: No, we're still on schedule for 6:2.
**Bschwartz**: We got confirmation yesterday.
**Bschwartz**: Panels are coming from Kentucky and they will be mobilizing on six two.
**Mparsons**: I'm sorry.
**Mparsons**: I'm sorry.
**Mparsons**: Ahmed.
**Mparsons**: Ahmed and Elliott.
**Mparsons**: Okay, can you start with the presentation, which we have to talk mainly today?
**Aelkarrimy**: Yep.
**Mparsons**: We can talk this after.
**Kevin.ly**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah.
**Aelkarrimy**: So we sent the presentation, got back the comments.
**Aelkarrimy**: I just wanted to walk those through with you and give you our reasoning behind this, and we can, you know, decide the best course of action.
**Aelkarrimy**: I know you sent back a response about GC parking.
**Aelkarrimy**: You were.
**Aelkarrimy**: I don't know if you can see my cursor.
**Aelkarrimy**: You were talking about putting it over here.
**Aelkarrimy**: And while, you know, there's two different types of workers here.
**Aelkarrimy**: You got your.
**Bclymer**: The work trucks.
**Aelkarrimy**: They got all the tools and all the parts and pieces.
**Aelkarrimy**: And it's typically the job sites I run, there's two different places to park.
**Aelkarrimy**: We need a section close to the building so that those guys can access their tools.
**Aelkarrimy**: And they're not spending a half hour walking to a truck to get something when they need it.
**Aelkarrimy**: And then you got the workers that just come on site and they, you know, they're just doing the work so they can go park, you know, far away.
**Aelkarrimy**: So, you know, we really need, you know, some spaces there, you know, even like this.
**Aelkarrimy**: Probably wouldn't handle all the workers that are going to come there at any point.
**Aelkarrimy**: But at least that'll take care of, you know, any kind of work trucks or things of that nature that we have on site.
**Aelkarrimy**: And you know, if there's a better space over here or something over here that works for you, like, we're open to that.
**Mparsons**: I'm sorry, can you make it a little bit bigger?
**Mparsons**: What's the comment from Ahmed?
**Mparsons**: Sorry, but.
**Mparsons**: But at first we have like a lot of members here attending who doesn't know, like general information for this project by Eliato.
**Mparsons**: So we, I want some like explanation one by one from the start.
**Mparsons**: Like not, not answering to the comment we made today.
**Mparsons**: Is that.
**Mparsons**: Is that okay?
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah.
**Aelkarrimy**: So when it comes to parking, you know, we have.
**Aelkarrimy**: Our contractors have trucks that have all of their equipment and tools and the parts and pieces they need to do their job.
**Aelkarrimy**: So we need to have some parking close to access to the job site.
**Aelkarrimy**: And in this case, you know, our employee entrance is here, construction worker entrance.
**Aelkarrimy**: So these construction workers can only go in and out here.
**Aelkarrimy**: And then if they have to walk all the way around this building to get to their truck, they're going to waste half their day walking back and forth.
**Aelkarrimy**: Whereas we'll have other workers that just come to the job site, they go in and work and then, you know, they, you know.
**Mparsons**: Yeah, yeah, we understand that it's kind of, kind of distance from the workers entrance in the parking space.
**Mparsons**: But actually the green part you mentioned in the above is not, not allowed to park there.
**Mparsons**: Right.
**Aelkarrimy**: This, it.
**Aelkarrimy**: It's a.
**Aelkarrimy**: That's the end of an orange color.
**Aelkarrimy**: That's this.
**Aelkarrimy**: These are the parking spots.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah, so let me circle it here.
**Aelkarrimy**: So it would be these spots right here.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Those are actually container staging lanes.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And I believe the Swan is already using three or four of them from the end there on the right.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And when we hit peak, we use a lot of those spaces.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: We hit peak June, July, August.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: You can do some shifting and leave some available.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: But that's really an LPD call if they want to allow vehicles in the yard.
**Bryan.wagar**: Team, what about if we currently have those designated spots for the loading dock so the highlighted in red areas.
**Bryan.wagar**: So those doors are for the Aliato team.
**Bryan.wagar**: If we are not having any shipments coming in, is it possible that the contractors park in front of the loading dock in those areas?
**Mparsons**: Is it possible there or just normal car?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: LPD would have to make that Decision, you know, Loss Prevention Division.
**Mparsons**: But basically we have to park in the left side.
**Mparsons**: We instructed basically right now the guard.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Checks instructions are not to let any personal vehicles in the yard.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: Is this parking over here special?
**Mparsons**: That's for other tenants.
**Mparsons**: So not our parking space.
**Aelkarrimy**: It's not your parking.
**Mparsons**: Yeah.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: There is a lot of available spots on that in that area.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I mean, they don't use that whole front piece.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So it is possible to give them some of those space.
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah.
**Mparsons**: If we asked to remark.
**Jdawson**: And you said these are container spots.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Bryan.wagar**: So they're about like 40ft in length, if anything.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: The regular trailer staging lanes.
**Bryan.wagar**: So if we would, if we were able to park, let's say four trucks back to back pickup trucks, like regular standard pickup trucks.
**Bryan.wagar**: Is that okay with you guys?
**Bryan.wagar**: If they're parked like stacked in front of each other?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah, for me, yes.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: But again, LPD would have to.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Loss Prevention division would have to say it was okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I can contact them afterwards and ask.
**Jdawson**: Perfect.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay, great.
**Aelkarrimy**: Because one way or the other, like those work trucks will have to come in and get right up to the building.
**Aelkarrimy**: It's just not feasible to haul some of the stuff they're bringing in each day for tools and equipment.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So each day they're going to have to access the bay doors to bring in their tools and equipment?
**Aelkarrimy**: Well, yeah, coming up to here, most likely.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah, they would have to come up to these bays or these bays.
**Aelkarrimy**: I know talking with the.
**Aelkarrimy**: With Joe, you know, at some point these bays will be cut off once they put all these racks in.
**Aelkarrimy**: So, you know, we'll have to bring everything in through the back here.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Gotcha.
**Aelkarrimy**: But that would be great.
**Aelkarrimy**: Like you say, if they're 40 foot long, we could stack them in there.
**Aelkarrimy**: I don't expect, you know, a ton of trucks, but there'll be a few that need to be close.
**Mparsons**: But after our confirmation.
**Kevin.ly**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: Next thing here.
**Aelkarrimy**: Restrooms for GC use.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yep, that's correct.
**Aelkarrimy**: We had it marked here as portable restroom locations.
**Bclymer**: Right here.
**Aelkarrimy**: So that's the portalette area.
**Aelkarrimy**: When it comes to this gate we have, this isn't an egress or really access gate for anything other than they're going to be running all along here when they bring in those, you know, tie the electric into that existing gear.
**Aelkarrimy**: So like for this stage of work, they're going to be working all through this area when they run the conduits, you know, for those, the wire coming out from the main switch gear.
**Aelkarrimy**: So we put this gate here because otherwise, you know, how Are they going to access this side over here to get in and do that work?
**Mparsons**: What work you're talking about?
**Mparsons**: It's not allowed to.
**Mparsons**: Jesse.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, Jesse.
**Jdawson**: I think what Jesse's saying is correct.
**Bryan.wagar**: But we stop at the first.
**Jdawson**: If you pan over to the left a little bit.
**Jdawson**: Right there.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Bryan.wagar**: So we're stopping right there.
**Jdawson**: So you suke to their point.
**Bryan.wagar**: For us to be able to, you know, run our conduit and go back and forth from the main distribution panel room, they're going to need to have access along that alleyway.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: Not.
**Mparsons**: Not going outside and go to the power room from outside.
**Aelkarrimy**: Well, they've got six parallel runs of three.
**Aelkarrimy**: I believe they're four inch feeders that come from this room here.
**Aelkarrimy**: They start here and they come into our site to feed that new 1200amp panel and everything that's over here, the new electrical.
**Aelkarrimy**: So this they'll be working through here for a bit.
**Aelkarrimy**: That's on the, you know, the construction schedule.
**Aelkarrimy**: When they're running the main feeders.
**Aelkarrimy**: That's this scope of work here.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: So during that the wiring, cabling work.
**Mparsons**: Do you have any fence over there until.
**Aelkarrimy**: Till the power room or there is no fence over there?
**Aelkarrimy**: No.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bryan.wagar**: They can't really block the entire way.
**Jdawson**: Yusuke.
**Jdawson**: Because you have egress doors for the.
**Bryan.wagar**: Rest of the occupants within the warehouse.
**Bryan.wagar**: So we have to maintain access to all those doors.
**Cheryl.green**: The Daifuku system is also pretty close to the back end there.
**Cheryl.green**: So it'd be tough to get a fencing in there and not impact operations.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: So to go in and out for the access to the powerhouse, we need some kind of gate over there.
**Aelkarrimy**: Well, otherwise they would be, you know, they got to get a lift.
**Aelkarrimy**: We're going to be storing and charging the lifts over here at night.
**Aelkarrimy**: So they're going to have to drive their lift out to this side.
**Aelkarrimy**: That's the only way to.
**Aelkarrimy**: To really do that.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: How do you think of this security point of view?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I mean, basically they're going to be up in the lift, so risk is minimized.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: However, we do right where the commodity electrical room is a very busy bagging area for the warehouse.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So that's where it'll be impacted.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: You know, we have some air cargo staging down there, but we have a lot of bagging and debagging in that area.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So depending where they're going to go.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Question.
**Mparsons**: I don't think a lot of space needed for this cabling work.
**Aelkarrimy**: It's just the width of basically a scissor lift.
**Aelkarrimy**: You know, Their rack will probably be 4 foot wide or so.
**Aelkarrimy**: No, scissor lifts are about 3 foot, maybe a bigger ones, 4 foot wide.
**Aelkarrimy**: And they'll be just running back and forth through here.
**Mparsons**: Just for the width of the scissor lift, right?
**Kevin.ly**: Yep.
**Mparsons**: Putting any cable temporary to the.
**Mparsons**: Close to the powerhouse or outside of the powerhouse.
**Aelkarrimy**: No, this is all permanent.
**Aelkarrimy**: It's the, you know, MC type.
**Aelkarrimy**: It's a clad.
**Aelkarrimy**: They're pre wired cables.
**Aelkarrimy**: So they just got to get up there and feed all these feeders up through and support them on their strut.
**Mparsons**: I don't think that much of a space.
**Mparsons**: Did they need it, the work?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I guess, yeah, I would just like I said, there's staff working below them.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: They're at the tables right there by those doors.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So we would have to see what kind of space they need and what could possibly fall from a lift with them below working at table.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah, I mean if you're concerned with that, the best thing would be just some portable fence panels with, you know, on stands that can be moved each day.
**Aelkarrimy**: Because like they'll run through here and you know, they'd probably go through, you know, put all their supports up first and then they'll run through and they'll pull all these cables through.
**Aelkarrimy**: So, you know, they'll, you know, as they work through this, they're done.
**Aelkarrimy**: They don't have to get back here and then they move and get this done and then they don't have to get back here, you know, that we can get with them and see what these increments are.
**Aelkarrimy**: But you know, it's going to be a split up, you know, you know, a day, you know, I can spell right here.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Then it might be okay because that first exit door is kind of where, if I recall that exit door to the room is where most of the people are.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And then after that it's pretty, pretty quiet that whole run.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So it's just right where you come out of the room.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: That'll be the challenge probably to that first exit door.
**Mparsons**: You mean the.
**Mparsons**: Near the powerhouse?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Right near the powerhouse.
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah.
**Mparsons**: Jesse, do you need some like workspace between the aisles, Powerhouse down to the construction area.
**Mparsons**: There will be just for the widths, right.
**Mparsons**: Widths of the scissors in, in the floor level.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah, they could probably like, you know, I don't know exactly where this rack's going, but like where the rack is under that.
**Aelkarrimy**: And then if they have cables, they can, you know, keep them coiled up or moved over, you know, as they're pulling these through or we can See if they're going to pull everything from this side then they would have it up, you know up by the ceiling.
**Aelkarrimy**: They may have to stretch it out and.
**Aelkarrimy**: And hang it up.
**Aelkarrimy**: I'll get with them and just get their method for that and get kind of durations for them exactly what they would need.
**Aelkarrimy**: But I would think they could you know working this way they would just put any cables or anything back towards the doors.
**Aelkarrimy**: How whatever would be the most out of the way.
**Aelkarrimy**: If this area down here is where all the activity is going on.
**Aelkarrimy**: Unless you're loading a truck or something.
**Mparsons**: So in the floor level you're going to occupy this for the width of the scissor lift and several hour cable.
**Mparsons**: Some just only for that.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah.
**Aelkarrimy**: Whatever cables are laid they're laying out.
**Kevin.ly**: Yep.
**Mparsons**: So not that much.
**Mparsons**: Right.
**Aelkarrimy**: I'll have to confirm.
**Mparsons**: Yeah.
**Mparsons**: Lift plus plus like three feet or something.
**Mparsons**: Maybe three, four feet or I would.
**Aelkarrimy**: Say they would need an aisle.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah.
**Aelkarrimy**: For their lift and their materials and cables and stuff.
**Aelkarrimy**: Probably another four feet, you know, seven, eight foot wide to get through there.
**Mparsons**: It step out area.
**Daisuke.mine**: If we need AirPods we can access this area during your construction.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: This is our way to the totes.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: This is our way to with the bales in the back.
**Daisuke.mine**: Area.
**Daisuke.mine**: After we go through this.
**Kevin.ly**: And we.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Have to listen to the deer in the morning and to return the truck to charge at night.
**Daisuke.mine**: So during postdoctor we can this area.
**Mparsons**: How long how much widths we have during your guys are constructing that area for the power wiring work.
**Aelkarrimy**: Let me see here.
**Bclymer**: New theaters.
**Aelkarrimy**: We have 20 days total.
**Bryan.wagar**: So part of that scope falls within the weekend, right?
**Aelkarrimy**: It's possible.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah.
**Aelkarrimy**: They could come in on a Saturday and do some things.
**Bryan.wagar**: Stuff that's in front of the powerhouse can be done to maybe run initially at the powerhouse up to our construction site and then we can start working on our construction site during the week.
**Bryan.wagar**: This way it's not in conflict with the Daifuku folks that are working there and the rest of the warehouse folks.
**Aelkarrimy**: I'll have to.
**Aelkarrimy**: I'll get with our electricians and I can put together like a broke out schedule in the areas of you know the time they need to get that done.
**Aelkarrimy**: You know there may not be enough weekends.
**Aelkarrimy**: If you do.
**Aelkarrimy**: If it's one day a week they'll be there for forever trying to get them in.
**Aelkarrimy**: So we'll have that by the neck.
**Aelkarrimy**: We'll get that tomorrow.
**Aelkarrimy**: We'll get a discussion with them on that.
**Mparsons**: Yeah.
**Mparsons**: And also you can instruct inform us how Much widths you need area you need for those works because we are using that that area too for our warehouse operation.
**Kevin.ly**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: And I don't know what this looks like in the facility but like what is like this first bay is kept open.
**Aelkarrimy**: Correct.
**Bclymer**: For.
**Aelkarrimy**: Just all the traffic it is to get in and out of the space or is.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: No there's from those dot plates there's probably maybe 9 or 10ft to some racking that's right there.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So there's more or less just an app.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: It's more or less just in aisle right now.
**Aelkarrimy**: Like this is so like where this is highlighted the racking almost starts that close to the outside.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah, it's just an.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: It's just an aisle.
**Bclymer**: That's it.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And then there's racking.
**Kevin.ly**: Okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And then on some of the dock plates that are there, you know there is some stored materials, some parts for GPS that they have actually staged on those plates.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Not the whole way down but a good portion of it.
**Mparsons**: Yeah.
**Mparsons**: But basically the hatched area is all the QPs the other automation area.
**Mparsons**: Right.
**Mparsons**: So we have is it 10ft probably the entire.
**Bryan.wagar**: It's not the entire gray area but that's something that should be verified when you guys mobilize on six two just to you know cross T's go through that alleyway and see what we're working with and how that's going to affect your means and methods to getting your forklifts versus the warehouses forklifts that operate along that aisle as well.
**Bryan.wagar**: But I think you guys will be able to define it a little bit more clearer come Tuesday.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yep.
**Daisuke.mine**: Once you will white sticker.
**Daisuke.mine**: So definitely we use space so frequent.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Other sounds way too busy.
**Daisuke.mine**: So definitely.
**Daisuke.mine**: So we are pressing the area.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yes.
**Daisuke.mine**: We chose now it's not using but I'm not sure so any closer I want to change something in this case is locking me here in that area.
**Daisuke.mine**: That is now the Bluetooth is here.
**Daisuke.mine**: Bluetooth is going to the TP address and then so make the space.
**Daisuke.mine**: That's why so many so frequent.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay well we'll look at that make an impact if we have to do it there.
**Daisuke.mine**: Yeah.
**Daisuke.mine**: So just so we to decide it now.
**Daisuke.mine**: I think some considerations required with after you mobilize.
**Mparsons**: Maybe we have to discuss more detail for this part like coordinating the schedule or limiting the work area or.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah we break down like this is.
**Aelkarrimy**: This is an overall project schedule.
**Aelkarrimy**: So we break down and we have a two week look ahead schedule that breaks down in much more detail the different activities.
**Aelkarrimy**: So when we come to something like this.
**Aelkarrimy**: We break that down, we review it and coordinate it with you and the people you have on site to.
**Aelkarrimy**: To get these day to day things, you know worked out.
**Aelkarrimy**: And so we're coordinated and everyone's on the same page.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: But it's a good thing that we, we have this kind of you know consideration right now and we, we need that to discuss.
**Daisuke.mine**: So and then.
**Daisuke.mine**: So no fence is required security in this.
**Daisuke.mine**: They work in there.
**Daisuke.mine**: That area I'm not sure currently.
**Daisuke.mine**: So we are secure that fencing.
**Daisuke.mine**: So initially discussion with the working space is a secure fence.
**Daisuke.mine**: Totally separate our workers under your.
**Daisuke.mine**: You are construct as well.
**Mparsons**: So maybe we have to talk to.
**Daisuke.mine**: Our security team and at the risk prevention.
**Mparsons**: Yes.
**Daisuke.mine**: Yes.
**Daisuke.mine**: LPD has to make decision.
**Daisuke.mine**: Yeah.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: They're going to decide whether they park in the yard.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: They can decide the parking area.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: They can coordinate it.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: But you know LPD needs to be.
**Mparsons**: Involved and we maybe we have to.
**Daisuke.mine**: Increase the guide for metal one guide guards.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I mean instead of doing fence you want to do an additional guard to stand there with them or with them so they go back other side.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I could look into that as well.
**Kevin.ly**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: Just so we can move on.
**Aelkarrimy**: All right.
**Aelkarrimy**: You know, talk a bit.
**Aelkarrimy**: You know in construction it's a lot different than.
**Aelkarrimy**: Than a finished building when it comes to life safety and exits and all those things.
**Aelkarrimy**: So like this is one big construction space we're not going to exit people into.
**Aelkarrimy**: You know we had some doors on the side here, but that's not an egress route from a construction site.
**Aelkarrimy**: So they're either going to go out this side through that door or they'll have to come through this gate to get to one of these doors.
**Aelkarrimy**: So that's why we didn't put anything any egress on the sides.
**Aelkarrimy**: And then you know we have some deliveries that have to come in.
**Aelkarrimy**: They come in on a flatbed.
**Aelkarrimy**: It's just the main, a lot of the main sprinkler pipe deliveries.
**Aelkarrimy**: We definitely will coordinate that again.
**Aelkarrimy**: Like we'll have that near term schedule where we'll have plenty of notice.
**Aelkarrimy**: You know it's.
**Aelkarrimy**: You know they're just kind of one time deals.
**Aelkarrimy**: I'll pull the truck in, unload the parts and pieces and then.
**Aelkarrimy**: Then get out of there.
**Mparsons**: It's.
**Mparsons**: Isn't it impossible to use the north stock for those long piping items?
**Mparsons**: The one we.
**Bclymer**: Here.
**Mparsons**: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Mparsons**: Right there.
**Aelkarrimy**: It's just the way they're coming.
**Jdawson**: All the red ones.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah.
**Kevin.ly**: There.
**Mparsons**: Actually if you trying to Deliver the material from the right bottom side.
**Mparsons**: We have to stop our operation in the.
**Mparsons**: In that part.
**Mparsons**: So it's kind of affecting to our warehouse operation.
**Mparsons**: I'm not sure how much you're gonna.
**Mparsons**: How long.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah.
**Mparsons**: How many times.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah.
**Aelkarrimy**: This is like canon.
**Aelkarrimy**: I don't know when you talk to the guys, how many deliveries they got.
**Aelkarrimy**: Five or six deliveries over the job.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah.
**Aelkarrimy**: And that's something they pull in.
**Bryan.wagar**: Jesse, you guys.
**Bryan.wagar**: You guys would be able to give us a timeline of when those shipments.
**Jdawson**: Are coming this way.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yep.
**Bryan.wagar**: Involved and understand what's going to happen when need to access that door.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yes, absolutely.
**Aelkarrimy**: And they're not.
**Bryan.wagar**: I know, but.
**Bryan.wagar**: I know, but I know that fast retail is like the gem, is to avoid using the door as much as possible.
**Jdawson**: So if.
**Bryan.wagar**: If a flatbed can back up into one of these loading docks and then we can pull in our materials, our long materials, directly through, let's say the one that's centered to the gate.
**Bryan.wagar**: That is at the immediate sky path area.
**Bryan.wagar**: I think you guys can kind of just go straight in versus trying to go in from the left, from right, pivot left, try to go through an occupied space with all that material and then going into your gate.
**Bryan.wagar**: I leave that up to you to confirm.
**Bryan.wagar**: But if you guys are able to accommodate that, I think the fast retail team and LPD would be very happy to see that we're not using that door.
**Kevin.ly**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: Just in talking with Brandon, he couldn't be on today.
**Aelkarrimy**: He said that was a must for those deliveries.
**Aelkarrimy**: So, I mean, if we figure something out before then, you know, we'll try to accommodate.
**Aelkarrimy**: But at this point, we got several of them that have to come through there.
**Mparsons**: So when the.
**Bryan.wagar**: Similar to what we were talking about.
**Jdawson**: The powerhouse.
**Aelkarrimy**: We'Re talking about sprinkler system.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So the trucks wouldn't come into the building.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: You would be unloading outside and bringing the piping through the building.
**Aelkarrimy**: I would have to confirm with Brandon, but they would unload them here and just fork them over here.
**Aelkarrimy**: These things are all bundled up.
**Aelkarrimy**: It's not like they're taking a piece at a time.
**Aelkarrimy**: So maybe just back up in there, fork it off, and get it in here.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I don't know that we could back a truck into the building at that point.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: That's kind of like active dock space.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: There's no really room to get a whole trailer in the building.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I don't believe.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: There's also a rack.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Right at that first pole.
**Aelkarrimy**: There's a rack.
**Daisuke.mine**: Because now our parking table.
**Aelkarrimy**: Or so.
**Daisuke.mine**: Inspection table is Almost floating bay occupied.
**Daisuke.mine**: Such a working space.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah, there's no.
**Daisuke.mine**: No room to.
**Daisuke.mine**: So moving the pocket.
**Aelkarrimy**: So this area has racks and tables in it.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Well, the first.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: The first pole bit.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: The first root support pole has racks all the way down.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And then it goes into.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Through a packing material where it's only maybe not even.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Not even six foot wide.
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah.
**Aelkarrimy**: So through here.
**Daisuke.mine**: So next side is totally in front.
**Daisuke.mine**: Also in using the parking station.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So there's no room there.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I mean even getting a forklift down there would be challenging.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: That's really not accessible currently.
**Daisuke.mine**: So small forklift also.
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah.
**Daisuke.mine**: Very tight space to go to the racking area, right?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay, well Mike, one more thing for you to take a look at Monday.
**Aelkarrimy**: And then we can maybe you can.
**Daisuke.mine**: See the operation side.
**Daisuke.mine**: Yeah, you can know it's very tight space.
**Mparsons**: Even it's for the small scissor lift or small forklift.
**Kevin.ly**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: Is there someone that can be scheduled to walk with Mike on Monday to get into all these areas?
**Mparsons**: Monday?
**Mparsons**: Yeah, we can.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah, we can be available.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Kevin.ly**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: Here's a common field office.
**Aelkarrimy**: Like a project like this.
**Aelkarrimy**: We will not have a field office on site.
**Aelkarrimy**: Just not something we need.
**Aelkarrimy**: Michael.
**Mparsons**: Just walking around the site.
**Aelkarrimy**: Always walking around the site.
**Aelkarrimy**: That's right.
**Jdawson**: I hope you have an apple watched and counting your steps.
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah.
**Aelkarrimy**: I don't know about exotech, but I would imagine they may set up a table.
**Aelkarrimy**: Like maybe we'll put a table in there and a chair just to do some paperwork in there.
**Aelkarrimy**: But yeah, it would just be in this area.
**Bschwartz**: Put something on the southern side as far away from the construction as possible.
**Bschwartz**: Just to try to get some quiet space somewhere quieter space.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: That's all.
**Kevin.ly**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: See on this one, we already talked about the gate.
**Aelkarrimy**: That's for the lift to get through.
**Aelkarrimy**: I would got all that.
**Aelkarrimy**: So this one here and just talking with Joe like, you know, you got employees that need to pass through here I guess on a regular basis.
**Aelkarrimy**: So you know, this is just be open when we're loading and unloading through this gate into the job site.
**Aelkarrimy**: So you know, unauthorized employees would be.
**Aelkarrimy**: No, like we put a sign.
**Aelkarrimy**: No construction personnel past this point.
**Aelkarrimy**: Or no construction personnel past this point if they're out here taking a delivery.
**Jdawson**: So that means that the GU area Yusuke would not have access to the.
**Bryan.wagar**: Left side of your off like the.
**Jdawson**: Left side of the warehouse at all.
**Bryan.wagar**: Unless we're going to grant them access.
**Jdawson**: Within that light blue area.
**Bryan.wagar**: But those.
**Bryan.wagar**: I mean, I would assume you guys would want only specified personnel that would.
**Jdawson**: Be allowed to have badges to go through.
**Jdawson**: But that would be something that you guys need to define.
**Mparsons**: You guys mean us?
**Bryan.wagar**: Fast retail.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, fast retail and lpd.
**Bryan.wagar**: Like what personnel on the GU side would need to gain access to that highlighted blue area.
**Bryan.wagar**: This way the Aliato team can issue badges for just those individuals along with their co workers to allow them to just cross through.
**Bryan.wagar**: But they can't go through the construction area whatsoever.
**Mparsons**: What?
**Bschwartz**: Yeah, yeah, I think I.
**Bschwartz**: Let's explain this.
**Bschwartz**: Let's go through this again.
**Bschwartz**: It should be open for people to pass through unless we're unloading.
**Bschwartz**: And then the gates would be open to where we're closed.
**Mparsons**: Yeah, we're not going through during the loading or unloading this materials from the south Doc.
**Mparsons**: We, we just.
**Mparsons**: We're just waiting for closing that gate to the normal.
**Mparsons**: Normal shape of the fence.
**Mparsons**: I guess.
**Mparsons**: So.
**Bryan.wagar**: Wait, so I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
**Mparsons**: You have to.
**Bryan.wagar**: One, one clarification.
**Bryan.wagar**: Are we saying.
**Bryan.wagar**: Because Jesse and Brent and Joe.
**Jdawson**: Joe said something else.
**Bryan.wagar**: Are we saying that the two gates on the perimeter, the two.
**Bryan.wagar**: The one that keeps the aisle going through to the GU area, those gates would remain open and only close when we have a delivery.
**Aelkarrimy**: Noted.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bryan.wagar**: So those two gates.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yousuke will stay open only when the delivery comes.
**Bryan.wagar**: They're going to close those two perimeter gates to stop any warehouse occupants from walking through.
**Mparsons**: So then they're safe just for like temporary.
**Bryan.wagar**: Like just temporary for a few hours Just to get the products through to our construction site.
**Bryan.wagar**: And then they'll open the gates back again.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Aelkarrimy**: And then close this gate.
**Daisuke.mine**: Maybe we need to so in advance, one day before mid hour.
**Daisuke.mine**: You're going to close the close shut down this area.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah, because I mean we're going back and forth all times, you know, G new staff and.
**Mparsons**: So we want to request you when you going to close this path for unloading and loading from the south lock?
**Mparsons**: Because we have to know, you know, we have to schedule those kind of things for our operation.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: If they're going to go on break during that period, we have to know so that we can give them a break earlier.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah, that's something Michael coordinate with.
**Aelkarrimy**: And then the exotech, Joe and his team will.
**Aelkarrimy**: Will just coordinate it, put it on that near term schedule.
**Bschwartz**: Yeah, and we wouldn't.
**Aelkarrimy**: We wouldn't.
**Bschwartz**: Again, as we've discussed before, we're not going to.
**Bschwartz**: We're going to be unloading from the north gate as much as possible until we start on Skypod B.
**Bschwartz**: And once that first rack goes in we'll have to start going from the south gate.
**Bschwartz**: So that doesn't start per the schedule until of course I closed that.
**Bschwartz**: That doesn't start.
**Bschwartz**: That doesn't start until November.
**Aelkarrimy**: Joe, you're talking this date right here?
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Bschwartz**: There you go.
**Bschwartz**: Rack installation A.
**Bschwartz**: So once that first row goes up, we'll have to.
**Bschwartz**: Any material that gets delivered after that date will come from the.
**Bschwartz**: That south gate.
**Aelkarrimy**: So yeah, you look through here like all these activities, we should be able to load things through the north and then, you know, up until that date, even other than the, you know, we got to work out the fire sprinkler pipe deliveries when those come in.
**Kevin.ly**: But.
**Mparsons**: Okay, so can you go back to the explanation?
**Mparsons**: Yeah, right there.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Mparsons**: So until here.
**Bclymer**: If you have any.
**Mparsons**: Question you can ask too.
**Mparsons**: General contractor.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: No, as far as when they're unloading, we just would need an unloading schedule.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: That would be the only thing so that we could work around it for that.
**Mparsons**: The blue part.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Right, right.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Kevin.ly**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: Well, other than that, until here, you have any like concerns or question.
**Jdawson**: On.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: The left side of the gate, how big is that?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Aisle one?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Did you guys.
**Mparsons**: So left side of which part?
**Aelkarrimy**: This one here?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah, that corner going towards the top of the drawing that, that space that's between the fence and the.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And the pole.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: How much space is that?
**Aelkarrimy**: This here?
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah.
**Aelkarrimy**: Was 10ft.
**Jdawson**: We're leaving 10ft.
**Kevin.ly**: Yep.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: From the column of the first surface to the construction fence will be 10.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah, right here.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: All right.
**Kevin.ly**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: I think that's it for that sheet.
**Aelkarrimy**: This one here.
**Aelkarrimy**: No problem coordinating that with the landlord building management.
**Mparsons**: We have to go from the top.
**Mparsons**: Like regular working hours will be Monday through Friday, 6am to 6pm.
**Kevin.ly**: Yep.
**Aelkarrimy**: And that's a window.
**Aelkarrimy**: Like maybe some days they don't start till 6:30 or 7.
**Aelkarrimy**: But we just want to have that window of when we're normally going to be working.
**Aelkarrimy**: We shouldn't be working outside of those hours unless something.
**Aelkarrimy**: It's a shutdown or it's a tie in.
**Aelkarrimy**: We're doing okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So the yard security usually opens the yard gates at 8:30 is when they normally open all the yard gates.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: You're saying that you're going to need access to the yard starting 6am to.
**Aelkarrimy**: Get our work the work trucks up there to unload all their tools.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we were, we were advised that we are able to access the site at 6am anytime.
**Jdawson**: Before that, the general contractor would have to reside in the site on the parking lot until 6am when the security opens up the doors.
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Generally again, the yard gates are secured at night till.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Till 8:30 when they start opening them up for the regular truck traffic.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So we'll have to make some kind of arrangement if you need access at 6.
**Jdawson**: Noted.
**Aelkarrimy**: You know, you think it too, like these, you know, the pump, the trucks that come service, those portalettes, they'll usually be early in the day as well.
**Aelkarrimy**: So.
**Aelkarrimy**: And I don't know how we, you know, Mike can coordinate that when he's there, how we do it.
**Aelkarrimy**: But you know, just getting those companies, you know, listed or on whatever book you have for your security people.
**Aelkarrimy**: But Mike will coordinate all that so they know who's coming.
**Aelkarrimy**: And they're usually on a pretty regular schedule.
**Aelkarrimy**: The day of the week they come out to service them.
**Jdawson**: Yusuke, are you going to provide the contact for Mike to be able to coordinate these shutdowns or the scheduling for access in certain areas that we just discussed earlier?
**Jdawson**: Is there going to be like an email contact that we would.
**Jdawson**: That GC would have readily available where you would all be cc'd as well as this LPD personnel, just so we can ensure that we're streamlined, or do we have to go through you and.
**Bryan.wagar**: Then you're gonna go to LPD.
**Mparsons**: Anyway?
**Mparsons**: We'll be okay.
**Mparsons**: You can just directly contact to the op guy ccme.
**Jdawson**: Perfect.
**Jdawson**: Do you mind just sending Mike and Jesse and Brandon that contact?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Our.
**Mparsons**: Our Tessa is LP guys for building Patrick.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Well, yeah, I had Patrick would approve the art being used and all the things.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Once he approves it, then I would coordinate with the guard check.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So all the check to all the truck traffic generally has to check in at the guard check.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And then guard check would then call on the radios to find door assignment.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So we would have to coordinate with someone on the construction team, maybe even give them a radio.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So when guard check calls them, they can.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: They can advise what door to send the truck to.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Who.
**Mparsons**: Who would be the main.
**Mparsons**: Main contact person for like coordinating those kinds like gc, LP guy, security guy will be.
**Mparsons**: Is that request.
**Mparsons**: Is it okay to request you?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: It's fine.
**Bclymer**: It can come.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Come through me.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Generally what we'll try to do is set up the regular protocol in the beginning so that.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: That back and forth contact is very limited.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: It doesn't really need to be, you know, touched every hour, every minute.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: It would just be, you know, if they're going to want the gates open at 6, we'll open up at 6.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Then if they get a delivery, guard Check will call them.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: They say they have a delivery.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: They won't let the truck until they confirm what door put the truck in.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Because remember, we have a sub tenant, and then we have our own trucking inbound and outbound.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And it's all trying to be positioned indoors.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So there's some coordinating, and there is some lines sometimes waiting for trucks to get positioned.
**Jdawson**: Jesse, you're on mute.
**Kevin.ly**: All right.
**Aelkarrimy**: You'll get that coordinated with Mike next week when he's on site.
**Aelkarrimy**: Is there a certain person he'll be meeting with for that?
**Jdawson**: Yusuke, you guys are on mute.
**Aelkarrimy**: Like the mystical.
**Aelkarrimy**: Someone's in here meeting us all.
**Jdawson**: His microphone isn't working.
**Jdawson**: And teams.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah, really?
**Aelkarrimy**: Usually I shut off my video.
**Aelkarrimy**: There's something about my face that makes my microphone not work sometimes.
**Jdawson**: So not just you, man.
**Mparsons**: Don't worry.
**Cheryl.green**: It works for everyone.
**Jdawson**: Is there a message?
**Mparsons**: Can you hear us?
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah, yeah.
**Aelkarrimy**: Now we can.
**Mparsons**: Okay, okay, okay.
**Mparsons**: Yeah, I said we can just talk with Mike in person next Monday for those kind of like.
**Mparsons**: Okay, who will be the contact person in kind of things?
**Aelkarrimy**: And do you issue badges for our people?
**Aelkarrimy**: What is the process for that?
**Mparsons**: Issue the badges?
**Aelkarrimy**: Well, is there any, like, badges that we're going to be wearing around there issued by.
**Mparsons**: For the access?
**Mparsons**: Yeah, I think.
**Mparsons**: What kind of like, we're not.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: No, I would advise any access point being added.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So the door will be open by security, and the security guard position inside the door.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: The building here, we have our own vests with our names and then the badges.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I'm not sure what their contractors are going to have, but general safety is the safety vest that states, you know, what company you're with.
**Mparsons**: So just.
**Mparsons**: We're not trying to give you a badge or, like, something as of now.
**Aelkarrimy**: Dang it.
**Aelkarrimy**: I always wanted a badge.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay, next here, Construction signage.
**Aelkarrimy**: So these are a few that we always have.
**Aelkarrimy**: And then, you know, the restricted area will have, you know, authorized personnel will add to that.
**Aelkarrimy**: You know, no construction personnel or construction personnel only just in between the areas where the fence is common to someone else and there's access.
**Mparsons**: I don't have any comment for that.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay, so, like, we got the shutdown dates just dependent on, you know, utility companies, you know, and.
**Aelkarrimy**: But based on our schedule right now, these were the dates that were in there.
**Aelkarrimy**: The comment had this showing on a Sunday.
**Aelkarrimy**: You know, we.
**Aelkarrimy**: We're not connecting to any exterior transformers.
**Aelkarrimy**: You know, everything.
**Aelkarrimy**: All the transformers that we're providing are new off of our system, so it'll just be that.
**Aelkarrimy**: And all that work will be isolated in that switch gear room, when they actually do the cut over, they'll simply kill power.
**Mparsons**: So this is kind of very critical point that it will be.
**Mparsons**: We request you to do this on Sunday and tentatively right now you're planning to do on October 26th.
**Mparsons**: But yeah, we need to, you know, coordinate correctly for this timeline.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, so.
**Jdawson**: So I think, Jesse, one of the questions that myself and Yasuke had for this one is just to confirm with your electrician that this is only a one day job, not really a two day job, because if it spills into Monday and there's no power for the remaining, like, occupants, that's going to be a problem.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: So if Sunday is too tight for the electrician, Saturday is an option as long as it's.
**Jdawson**: It falls within the weekend and not during the week.
**Jdawson**: So that was the only concern behind this comment.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah, I don't foresee it taking that long because they'll have everything pulled up to the gear.
**Aelkarrimy**: They'll have everything downstream terminated.
**Aelkarrimy**: You know, it's just a matter of opening that gear up, landing the wires on the breaker and closing things up.
**Mparsons**: So this takes only for few hours.
**Mparsons**: Like within one day.
**Aelkarrimy**: It should be a one day deal.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: So during this shutdown, maybe we have to.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: It would impact daifuku because the machine would have to be shut down and then restarted and tested to see that it started back up again.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Right.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: If they're going to shut the building power down.
**Mparsons**: I'm not sure how, like how shutting down whole electric electrical parts, I'm not.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Sure we have to verify what they're shutting down because we have ISD.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: They would need to be notified because we have IDFs that are on battery backup.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Also, the fire system is the pumps run on electric.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So we would have to have a firewatch if it's going to be down for a long time.
**Jdawson**: If it's over the four hours, we would need a firewatch.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Aelkarrimy**: Jesse, you're.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah, the fire watches are only if you go past four hours.
**Aelkarrimy**: But like, this building has got multiple.
**Aelkarrimy**: Probably transport, you know, service transformers to it.
**Aelkarrimy**: We'd have to look at, you know, on the electrical drawings and see, like it's not gonna.
**Aelkarrimy**: I can't imagine this would shut the entire building down.
**Aelkarrimy**: It'll just be everything fed out of that transformer utility feed that we have to shut down.
**Aelkarrimy**: So, you know, that'll be something Mike can look at too.
**Aelkarrimy**: He'll coordinate with the electricians.
**Aelkarrimy**: We'll figure out everything that is fed out of that from that transformer.
**Aelkarrimy**: And then we'll have.
**Aelkarrimy**: Then we can work with you guys, coordinate the plan for what all is affected and schedule accordingly for that shutdown.
**Cheryl.green**: Jesse, based.
**Cheryl.green**: Based on my walk of the site, there's only two utility transformers for the building.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Cheryl.green**: So just be aware of that when you're coordinating downtown.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay, well, one, two out.
**Mparsons**: One out of two will be shut down.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So again, as long as they let us know in advance, and we can let those teams that are involved know that they're impacted, when they can make their plan to be fine.
**Kevin.ly**: Okay.
**Kevin.ly**: Who knows?
**Kevin.ly**: We need.
**Daisuke.mine**: Everything set to.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: He said his electrician would tell us what would be impacted before they.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Before they shut down so that we can make the arrangements.
**Kevin.ly**: Yep.
**Kevin.ly**: Thank you.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: The question is, when will you let us know.
**Aelkarrimy**: That'S something early on.
**Aelkarrimy**: I mean, they'll let you know months before we shut that down because that's something they'll start working on, you know, right off the bat.
**Aelkarrimy**: You know, things like that.
**Aelkarrimy**: They'll coordinate.
**Aelkarrimy**: So data, I can't give you.
**Aelkarrimy**: I'm sorry.
**Mparsons**: I said months before shut down, Right?
**Aelkarrimy**: That's right.
**Aelkarrimy**: That's right.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yep.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: You know, same thing with the fire sprinkler main.
**Aelkarrimy**: You know, they're going to pipe everything over to where they're making these connections.
**Aelkarrimy**: So I can't imagine that's more than a couple hours worth of work when they actually make their tie in.
**Aelkarrimy**: So again, that's.
**Aelkarrimy**: It's not a prolonged shutdown.
**Aelkarrimy**: So I was talking to a man like, you know, a firewatch, you only need if you shut a system down.
**Bclymer**: For over four hours.
**Aelkarrimy**: So, you know, I don't anticipate that being an issue.
**Mparsons**: This is dated Saturday.
**Mparsons**: Was it Tuesday and Saturday, right, Ahmed?
**Bryan.wagar**: I think it was Saturday for 4.
**Jdawson**: 18, 20, 26, and then it was Sunday.
**Jdawson**: It was Tuesday for 12, 23, 25, and then it was Sunday for 10, 26, 25.
**Mparsons**: Okay, so during that time, during a few hours, we cannot use, like, restroom or something.
**Jdawson**: Your fire alarm and your fire sprinkler system might be down during that period for just a few hours while they do the connection points.
**Jdawson**: So they're going to run all of the piping.
**Jdawson**: Everything's going to be connected to the deck and the walls and whatnot.
**Jdawson**: Everything's going to be run to the main room.
**Jdawson**: And then right before the shutdown, they would let you know, like, a month in advance, hey, on this day, we'll have everything ready.
**Jdawson**: So we will need to shut down on this day.
**Jdawson**: This way, it gives you some time to coordinate with the team on the effects of what is being shut down.
**Bryan.wagar**: And then once you guys approve.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, for the electric, it's also the fire sprinkler, really, because you're going to shut down the system eventually for a few hours as well.
**Mparsons**: So I just wanted to confirm what is affection to shutting down the fire sprinkler main connection, like cannot use the.
**Aelkarrimy**: Water or so the.
**Aelkarrimy**: Your.
**Aelkarrimy**: That puts your fire alarm system in test, because there's, there's, you know, flow switches and other things in the fire sprinkler pipe that would send an alarm off.
**Aelkarrimy**: So they simply put it in test so they don't get a false alarm.
**Aelkarrimy**: But if a smokehead or smoke detector senses smoke, it's still going to send off an alarm.
**Aelkarrimy**: It's just not going to send a signal out to the fire department to send trucks.
**Aelkarrimy**: So, you know, that's, that's the downtime when it comes to sprinkler work.
**Aelkarrimy**: And then your sprinkler system's not, you know, it's been deactivated.
**Aelkarrimy**: So we have a whole team on site when all these things are happening.
**Aelkarrimy**: So if there is an actual event that goes off, like, we'll.
**Aelkarrimy**: We're there to make the call, the fire department would need to be called, but it's simply the time your wet sprinkler system will not have water in it.
**Jdawson**: And you basically just call the fire department and letting them know, hey, from this time to this time, we're just putting the system on test.
**Jdawson**: So this way, if it does trigger the alarm, they don't.
**Jdawson**: The police department and the fire department don't.
**Jdawson**: Don't really come through.
**Kevin.ly**: Right?
**Aelkarrimy**: That's right.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Aelkarrimy**: Because it's gonna.
**Aelkarrimy**: You're gonna get an alarm when you shut that water off.
**Aelkarrimy**: So that's all it's for.
**Mparsons**: So, Ahmed, is this the time we request some, like, FM inspector computer?
**Jdawson**: No, not yet.
**Jdawson**: Not yet.
**Jdawson**: Once.
**Jdawson**: Once the system is up and Skypod B is ready, you can see in the schedule they have an FM inspection.
**Jdawson**: When all of the tooling is done, the Skypod B is ready to be fired up.
**Jdawson**: Just so then they can test it.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so after this one, it's.
**Jdawson**: After the detailing, you'll see it in the schedule.
**Jdawson**: It says FM inspection for Skypod B and then FM inspection for Skypod A.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: All right.
**Mparsons**: I think we have limited time left, so you can go through the whole.
**Mparsons**: The rest of the.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: Keba is a project manager.
**Aelkarrimy**: He'll probably be up there once a month on the job site.
**Aelkarrimy**: But Most once a month.
**Aelkarrimy**: He'll be coming on site for a week or something.
**Mparsons**: Few days, prob.
**Aelkarrimy**: Probably a few days.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah.
**Mparsons**: And Mike will be always on site.
**Aelkarrimy**: That's right.
**Aelkarrimy**: When we have work going on, he'll be there.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: But you can reach out to us at any point if you need something.
**Aelkarrimy**: That's myself and Brandon's info.
**Aelkarrimy**: Talk to Joe and you can speak to this.
**Aelkarrimy**: But you know, they, it's probably a little too early for them to know which of their guys they're going to send here.
**Aelkarrimy**: So that's why they put it to be determined when they pick the person that's going to be their install manager on site.
**Bschwartz**: Yeah, when we have, when we have our person assigned, which will be in the upcoming weeks.
**Bschwartz**: I believe I'm being told we're going to have two on site supervisors.
**Bschwartz**: So I'll provide that information.
**Bschwartz**: And the on site supervisors will be the emergency contact as well.
**Bschwartz**: One of them I believe is actually coming from Japan.
**Bclymer**: So who, huh?
**Mparsons**: Who is that?
**Bschwartz**: One of the on site supervisors.
**Bschwartz**: He's from our Japan location.
**Bschwartz**: So he'll be out there as well.
**Mparsons**: Somebody might know him.
**Bschwartz**: They might, they might.
**Bschwartz**: I, I, I didn't get his name.
**Bschwartz**: It was just, it was something that's being, it was something that's being discussed.
**Bschwartz**: Just because this is a large site and they do want to have two people out, possibly have two people out there.
**Bschwartz**: So we will have some extra people which will be nice.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Kevin.ly**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: You know, we just mentioned some highlighted dates.
**Aelkarrimy**: You know, that's the reason they put it in yellow.
**Aelkarrimy**: You know, our mobilization date, getting on site started.
**Aelkarrimy**: And then the, you know, the, the racking install dates, they're, the important things is when that racking goes in and all these other things can.
**Mparsons**: Tie into detail schedule.
**Mparsons**: So maybe we can share you later.
**Aelkarrimy**: And then we have, you know, the end date.
**Aelkarrimy**: Demobilization.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Mparsons**: Is it, is it?
**Mparsons**: Joseph, go live is August 3rd.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: And again when we demobilize, that just means like if our contractors aren't working.
**Aelkarrimy**: But we'll be back for the, any finals, you know, the go live date will be there to make sure it's nothing we need to do to help out.
**Aelkarrimy**: But you know, as of exit lighting done on 5 22.
**Aelkarrimy**: Get the temp fence out of there.
**Aelkarrimy**: Get our final inspections like we're done.
**Aelkarrimy**: Until you're ready to turn it all on.
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Jesse, can you go back to the previous sheet?
**Jdawson**: There was a comment where we highlighted Skypod A's rack installation.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah, he, yeah, that I Was talking canon.
**Aelkarrimy**: That should have been red.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Daisuke.mine**: We.
**Jdawson**: We assumed it was red.
**Jdawson**: Mesuke as well.
**Jdawson**: But we just wanted to clarify that.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah.
**Aelkarrimy**: The rack install.
**Kevin.ly**: Yep.
**Aelkarrimy**: So it'll update.
**Jdawson**: Suka.
**Jdawson**: Any other questions on the schedule?
**Mparsons**: Not from my side.
**Jdawson**: Okay, let's jump to page seven.
**Jdawson**: Jesse.
**Aelkarrimy**: Maintain Wednesday at 5:30.
**Aelkarrimy**: We can put that down if that works best for everybody.
**Aelkarrimy**: It's not a problem.
**Mparsons**: I don't have any comment for this one but I wanted to add some like I want to share you some the status Excel like managing table and I would like you to request those kind of one too to for the attachment of this report.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: I'll stop sharing if you want to share yours.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: Bill, do you have like they have like snapshot or something that I shared you yesterday.
**Mparsons**: It's got a time to.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: I thought you had it.
**Aelkarrimy**: You said you were going to share it.
**Mparsons**: I found it.
**Bclymer**: Give me.
**Mparsons**: Give me a second.
**Mparsons**: Such like this one for your reference.
**Mparsons**: Like you know this is kind of item items and task concern report and this is like today's status versus plan status and the differences using some kind of bar chart.
**Mparsons**: And we can know visibly like the construction status is working well not.
**Mparsons**: Or not.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah yeah.
**Aelkarrimy**: The schedule update like you know that has activities I don't know that we.
**Bclymer**: See here.
**Mparsons**: Yeah you can just utilize those kind of image and do.
**Mparsons**: I can respect your way to control the status.
**Mparsons**: But yeah this is our like like reference we use another project.
**Mparsons**: So if you can follow this it will be appreciated.
**Mparsons**: But I'm not like forcing you to follow this one.
**Mparsons**: But yeah, just for reference.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah I'll.
**Aelkarrimy**: Once we get like the near term schedule.
**Aelkarrimy**: When you see it's link you know the broke out detail that's in those.
**Aelkarrimy**: You know and it's got you know the original start date, end date you know and everything you know it's.
**Aelkarrimy**: It tracks off of that so you can see where things are going as we move along.
**Aelkarrimy**: But yeah, send it over.
**Aelkarrimy**: We'll take a look at it.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Aelkarrimy**: I think the last sheet share here.
**Aelkarrimy**: So like when this monthly manpower log this would be like the peak amount of workers on any given day in the month.
**Mparsons**: So at the peak maybe we have like around.
**Mparsons**: Around 40.
**Mparsons**: Over 40 people.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah.
**Aelkarrimy**: I mean this could be you know this is just an example.
**Aelkarrimy**: This doesn't mean what we're projecting most people we work on site.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah.
**Aelkarrimy**: I mean it could be 10 electric electricians some days.
**Aelkarrimy**: You know just depends.
**Aelkarrimy**: But you'll just get an idea of what The.
**Aelkarrimy**: The peak man looks like.
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah.
**Kevin.ly**: Yep.
**Aelkarrimy**: And like this here, Alito, we're not installing anything.
**Aelkarrimy**: You know, it's all our subcontractors.
**Aelkarrimy**: We probably should have put the sprinkler sub in here.
**Aelkarrimy**: And if he's got two lifts or whatever he's using, you know, they still need to coordinate around the, you know, the areas that needed the sky lift for, you know, because of that production.
**Aelkarrimy**: But I think Joe had some good ideas and things we can do to work around that and.
**Mparsons**: Okay, so looking at this table, maybe we need to.
**Mparsons**: They're using like 40 or 50 car parking in the peak.
**Aelkarrimy**: It could be up to that many.
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah.
**Bschwartz**: This, this won't be.
**Bschwartz**: It won't be one car per person here by any means.
**Mparsons**: Oh, somebody.
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah.
**Bschwartz**: Ex.
**Bschwartz**: The exotech team.
**Bschwartz**: You know, it's 25, but you know, 12 will be the contractor.
**Bschwartz**: 12 to 14 will be the contractor.
**Bschwartz**: I'm sure that'll be spread out between, you know, three or four cars.
**Bschwartz**: You know, it doesn't necessarily mean a car per person by any means.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Fence and plumbing will be done by the time exotech gets in.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Bschwartz**: And parts of this, I'm, you know, I'm counting myself possible, you know, in this count as well.
**Bschwartz**: And I can park in the main parking lot so you don't have to worry about that.
**Jdawson**: Good workout.
**Bschwartz**: You know, I'm not just grabbing those scooters.
**Aelkarrimy**: Someone needs to start like a golf cart rental company and park it out there.
**Aelkarrimy**: All these workers that are lazy, they get one.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: That's all right.
**Aelkarrimy**: That was the last sheet.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yep.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: Thanks for your explanation and yeah, I'm looking forward to see.
**Mparsons**: See Mike in next Monday.
**Aelkarrimy**: That's right.
**Mparsons**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yasuke, did you want this presentation cleaned up?
**Mparsons**: We wanted to spread those to our members.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Kevin.ly**: Yep.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah, we'll go through and from all the notes we took today and you know, we still need to coordinate with electrician, but we can just, you know, I don't know like on this, if you're dispersing it to your team members, you know, we just maybe cloud this area and say, you know, there's the main feeder activity is going to be happening in here, you know, approximately 20 days.
**Aelkarrimy**: That's going to be coordinated, you know, with the on site, your team and our teams to work out how this is going to work.
**Mparsons**: You said 20 days.
**Aelkarrimy**: I believe that's what was overall.
**Aelkarrimy**: But you know, they may spend a couple days in here getting prepped, you know.
**Aelkarrimy**: You know, that includes the Feeders running out to where all the panels and everything is over here.
**Aelkarrimy**: So this work in here may be half of the schedule.
**Mparsons**: Something like that.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: Something like that.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And Jesse, can you guys use the latest logistics plan because it actually has the correct fence footprint.
**Jdawson**: It has the parking lot on the left.
**Jdawson**: But if you guys are planning on occupying some of those once Yasuka gets LPD approval, then you guys can update that logistics plan to include the.
**Jdawson**: The north parking spots.
**Aelkarrimy**: Oh, you're talking these over here?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: If you open the email I sent Candon, it has a new logistics plan based off of the new backgrounds and the fence that myself and Yusuke developed.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah, we'll.
**Aelkarrimy**: I'll take a look at that.
**Jdawson**: I kept it the same size, so you can literally copy paste my base point and just drop all your notes back in there.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: All right.
**Jdawson**: Just a quick question, Brian.
**Jdawson**: Wager just for the electrical submittals that are out there right now, when do you.
**Bryan.wagar**: When do you anticipate them coming towards our.
**Jdawson**: Our side?
**Jdawson**: Now, like, do you think you're.
**Jdawson**: You guys are going to have a response, like within the next few days?
**Cheryl.green**: Yeah, we'll have those wrapped up in the next few days.
**Cheryl.green**: If not tomorrow, then by at least end of day Friday.
**Jdawson**: Awesome.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: How's that working with the job planner?
**Aelkarrimy**: Have you guys found it easy to access?
**Jdawson**: Easy to access, but I'm waiting for Brian to upload so that I can see how easy it is to download and his portion with the.
**Jdawson**: With the stamp on it.
**Jdawson**: But I'm just waiting to see if it's similar to Procore.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: Do you have any questions?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: From our side, I think we're good.
**Aelkarrimy**: Good deal.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: Thank you very much for today.
**Kevin.ly**: Yep.
**Aelkarrimy**: Thank you guys.
**Aelkarrimy**: Get that updated and sent over?
**Kevin.ly**: Yep.
**Mparsons**: Yes, please.
**Mparsons**: Thank you very much.
**Aelkarrimy**: Thanks.
**Bschwartz**: Appreciate you all.
**Bschwartz**: Thank you.
**Jdawson**: Thanks.
**Aelkarrimy**: Bye.
