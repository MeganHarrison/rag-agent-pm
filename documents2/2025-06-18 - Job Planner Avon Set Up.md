**Kmass**: See if this works.
**Kmass**: Can you hear me okay?
**Speaker 1**: Loud and clear.
**Kmass**: Oh, perfect.
**Kmass**: Alrighty.
**Kmass**: I, I, I wanted to, like, send an invite so Fireflies can record it and then you can go back and reference it when you need it.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, that's a great idea.
**Kmass**: How you doing, man?
**Speaker 1**: Good.
**Kmass**: You feeling overwhelmed?
**Kmass**: You feeling good?
**Speaker 1**: I mean, there.
**Kmass**: You be honest with me.
**Kmass**: I get.
**Kmass**: Yeah.
**Kmass**: I mean, it's over.
**Kmass**: Feel like it's like drinking out of a fire hose.
**Speaker 1**: Yep.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, it was.
**Speaker 1**: I mean, I felt, I feel like it was, it was worse, maybe the second week, but now it's like, it's starting to balance out.
**Kmass**: Yeah.
**Kmass**: I promise you it's not always like this.
**Kmass**: It's just this particular client.
**Kmass**: It is.
**Kmass**: And, you know, we roll with the punches.
**Kmass**: But if you're ever feeling overwhelmed, good, Call me and we'll chat about it.
**Kmass**: Because I've get overwhelmed sometimes, but you just gotta, you just gotta like, make a list, dude.
**Kmass**: And, and just like every morning I make a list and there's like five things I have to get done no matter what.
**Kmass**: And then I leave.
**Kmass**: You know, I feel good about leaving when those five things are done.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: I had to like, a whole bunch of, like, stickies everywhere.
**Speaker 1**: So before I leave, I just scratch off old ones and put a new one.
**Kmass**: Something that's really helped me, me.
**Kmass**: And you may not like it, but it's something I learned is I do.
**Kmass**: I have this notebook.
**Kmass**: I write everything down, like, just like calls and stuff, just so I have it in writing.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Kmass**: And then at the back of it, I have each job.
**Kmass**: So I have Ulta, Dallas, I have.
**Kmass**: And I just have like a running list.
**Kmass**: We use Notion too.
**Kmass**: But this is like my personal running list, right?
**Kmass**: And when it's, when it's done, I circle it and put a date when I got it done.
**Kmass**: So.
**Kmass**: And then every morning I go to that list and I was like, okay, that needs to get done.
**Kmass**: And then I add it to my, to my morning.
**Kmass**: I'm like, okay, these are the things that I have to have done this morning.
**Kmass**: And then it's so satisfying to cross off.
**Speaker 1**: It does feel good.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Kmass**: So.
**Speaker 1**: Quickly, before we move on to.
**Kmass**: Japan, can you hear Me.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Yes, I do.
**Kmass**: Dude, my freaking.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, I don't hear you now.
**Speaker 1**: You have your headphones are losing.
**Kmass**: There we go.
**Kmass**: I can hear you now.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, good.
**Kmass**: Yeah, I don't know.
**Kmass**: It's stupid.
**Speaker 1**: I just want to look at this quick before we move on.
**Speaker 1**: So I changed the orientation and just closed it with this, I guess.
**Speaker 1**: That's perfect.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Kmass**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: All right.
**Speaker 1**: So I have this and the top detail.
**Speaker 1**: So I just.
**Speaker 1**: I'm just going to send those two details.
**Kmass**: Yeah.
**Kmass**: Ideally when we build.
**Kmass**: So when we build this and if we're going.
**Kmass**: I haven't looked at pictures, but will we be going across Joyce?
**Kmass**: Basically.
**Speaker 1**: What do you mean?
**Kmass**: So the way you have this right now is attached to the underside of Joyce.
**Kmass**: Running parallel.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Kmass**: Running perpendicular.
**Speaker 1**: Right, Right.
**Kmass**: Ideally we put this top plate where it's.
**Kmass**: It falls on a joist laterally.
**Kmass**: Right.
**Kmass**: And so.
**Kmass**: Or like a girder.
**Kmass**: So let me.
**Kmass**: And that way the underside of the plate is on a continuous girder, if that makes sense.
**Kmass**: Or joist.
**Kmass**: So that creates our separation.
**Kmass**: And then our chicken wire has something to attach to going up above.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: I guess I was.
**Speaker 1**: Was doing it as they had it in the old space.
**Speaker 1**: But I mean, at some point it's going to be parallel to this.
**Kmass**: Right.
**Kmass**: And so when we do go parallel, we'll attach it to the underside of the joist and we should be.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Speaker 1**: So we don't have to go all the way up here.
**Kmass**: Yeah, I think that looks good, man.
**Speaker 1**: You're.
**Kmass**: You're.
**Kmass**: You're a.
**Kmass**: Becoming a sketchup wizard.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I have.
**Speaker 1**: I have used it for a long time in the.
**Speaker 1**: It keeps changing, but it gets better.
**Kmass**: One second.
**Kmass**: This is William calling me.
**Kmass**: Hey, William, I'm right here.
**Kmass**: Is it.
**Kmass**: Isn't it free?
**Speaker 1**: That online version is free.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Kmass**: Nice.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, but like, there's certain things if you want to say you want to export it to.
**Speaker 1**: You can export it to all of these different, like CAD files we don't.
**Kmass**: Have for Leaf right now.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Would you say the maintenance guy gonna.
**Kmass**: You know, move a little stuff on the.
**Kmass**: You know.
**Kmass**: Yeah.
**Kmass**: If you need him to move stuff is.
**Kmass**: Bugger.
**Kmass**: His name's Bug.
**Kmass**: Is he around here?
**Kmass**: Oh, yeah, he's there.
**Kmass**: Let me go.
**Kmass**: I'll be right back, Kevin.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.

**Kmass**: Hey, what's up, Alex?
**Speaker 1**: Morning, Alex.
**Speaker 1**: How you doing?
**Speaker 1**: Are you reading from the.
**Speaker 1**: There's no school 6 12.
**Speaker 1**: There is.
**Speaker 1**: There is a new.
**Speaker 1**: A newer version of that that came yesterday.
**Speaker 1**: It doesn't stop.
**Speaker 1**: Let me see if I can forward that to you as well.
**Speaker 1**: Let me.
**Speaker 1**: Let me open that one, because I think the new one does not have the old one.
**Speaker 1**: It just has the additional stuff.
**Kmass**: S.A.
**Speaker 1**: Which one do you have?
**Speaker 1**: Is it 6 12?
**Kmass**: All right, Campo.
**Kmass**: Sorry.
**Speaker 1**: Got it.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, I see.
**Speaker 1**: Yep.
**Speaker 1**: Additional charging, near count line countering 20.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Kmass**: And.
**Speaker 1**: I think they want us to add that here.
**Speaker 1**: No, they.
**Speaker 1**: I think they sent us the.
**Speaker 1**: He sent me the latest AutoCAD file.
**Speaker 1**: I'm trying to open that file right now, so I can.
**Speaker 1**: Sure.
**Speaker 1**: Here.
**Speaker 1**: I can do that.
**Speaker 1**: I'll find out more information.
**Speaker 1**: So you guys are basically working on updating everything that you have.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, I see.
**Speaker 1**: Let me see.
**Speaker 1**: Because.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, we did.
**Speaker 1**: We did receive more information yesterday.
**Speaker 1**: So let me see, actually, if it has any.
**Speaker 1**: If it has more electrical stuff for electrical.
**Speaker 1**: SA.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So there are 32 new workstations at the new conveyor pack between column 16 to 17.
**Speaker 1**: So that needs to be added.
**Speaker 1**: And it.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, so you're looking at the guardrails at column line 17.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, so you.
**Speaker 1**: You are asking if that's where the.
**Speaker 1**: The.
**Speaker 1**: Got it.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, gotcha.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: I just.
**Speaker 1**: I just sent you the new scope, and then it's gonna be two emails, one with an attachment, and one the scopes are in the body of the email.
**Speaker 1**: All right, and once I find out, I'll let you know.
**Speaker 1**: All right, thank you.
**Kmass**: Was that Alex?
**Speaker 1**: It was, yes.
**Kmass**: Yeah, he called me.
**Kmass**: I told him to call.
**Kmass**: I said, stop, Kebba.
**Kmass**: He'll get on it.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Kmass**: Can you.
**Kmass**: Can you see my screen?
**Kmass**: Let's just.
**Kmass**: Let's just hunker down and do this real quick.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Kmass**: And then you can go back and watch it.
**Kmass**: But now, you know, like, when.
**Kmass**: Brownsburg.
**Kmass**: I'll have you set up Brownsburg.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Yes, I see your screen.
**Speaker 1**: Yep.
**Kmass**: Okay, so first thing is adding.
**Kmass**: Adding the.
**Kmass**: The main contract, the owner contract.
**Kmass**: And so there's a couple ways you can do it.
**Kmass**: You always want to start adding in your project contacts.
**Kmass**: So you see.
**Kmass**: Did you put J.P.
**Kmass**: in here already?
**Speaker 1**: Yes, I did.
**Kmass**: You did put J.P.
**Kmass**: in here?
**Speaker 1**: Yep.
**Kmass**: Okay, so cool.
**Kmass**: So once you have the.
**Kmass**: The owner's rep in there, then you can go to.
**Kmass**: I would just put him as the owner, to be honest.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Kmass**: Because he essentially is.
**Kmass**: He's who we built.
**Kmass**: Then we actually need to make sure his permissions are right.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I did make some changes there.
**Kmass**: Did you make some changes?
**Speaker 1**: I did, yeah.
**Kmass**: Okay, good.
**Speaker 1**: The default makes them.
**Speaker 1**: See all the finance stuff.
**Speaker 1**: I don't know if that.
**Speaker 1**: That didn't make sense to me.
**Speaker 1**: So I changed it so he.
**Speaker 1**: So they don't see all that.
**Kmass**: Yeah, I don't want him to see.
**Kmass**: He can.
**Kmass**: He can go ahead and see his contract.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Kmass**: And his contract change order, but I don't want him seeing.
**Kmass**: He doesn't need to see these.
**Kmass**: You know, we'll update.
**Kmass**: I mean, we can.
**Kmass**: I guess he can see the schedule here.
**Kmass**: You know, we'll.
**Kmass**: We'll send him all these officially, like he doesn't need to see.
**Kmass**: Oh, no, my computer's gonna die.
**Kmass**: Give me.
**Kmass**: Give me five minutes.
**Kmass**: I'm gonna run out to my car, okay?
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, no problem.
**Kmass**: He can.
**Kmass**: He can view.
**Kmass**: I don't want him to view markup, and I don't want him to see the daily report, okay?
**Kmass**: So that.
**Kmass**: That's between us.
**Kmass**: Other than that, all looks good.
**Kmass**: So save that.
**Kmass**: I'll be right back, okay?
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, sounds good.
