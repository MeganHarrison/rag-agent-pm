## Transcript
**Ataylor**: I just kind of want to walk through this process.
**Ataylor**: So, currently, everything, all the lighting that's in D mod right now is powered out of a panel.
**Ataylor**: That final state will also control the new lighting for the CD connection.
**Ataylor**: So all of the existing lighting in D mod while we are installing the new lights, needs to be temporary, temporarily powered.
**Ataylor**: And we're expecting two down times, basically, to.
**Ataylor**: To connect that.
**Ataylor**: Those lighting to new power.
**Ataylor**: Right.
**Ataylor**: Or to a different control panel.
**Ataylor**: Is that right?
**Sglaze**: Yes.
**Ataylor**: Okay, so there'll be one downtime tomorrow at 5:00am Well, I just.
**Shooper**: Drew, it's just.
**Shooper**: It's the same panel.
**Shooper**: There's.
**Shooper**: They have temporary runs coming out of it right now.
**Ataylor**: Gotcha.
**Sglaze**: Yeah, I just talked with Mario too, and I know.
**Sglaze**: Scott, you walked with Mario, correct?
**Shooper**: Yeah.
**Shooper**: And he's sitting right here next to me.
**Sglaze**: Sweet.
**Sglaze**: So, yeah, Drew, there's gonna be two shutdowns, and I guess there's a lot more work involved with it than I.
**Sglaze**: Than I thought.
**Sglaze**: So we're gonna come in around like 2 or 3 in the morning.
**Sglaze**: I don't believe anyone's working there.
**Sglaze**: And just make.
**Sglaze**: Give us an extra couple of hours to make sure all those circuits get transferred over.
**Sglaze**: And that'll be.
**Sglaze**: That'll be Wednesday and Thursday.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: And you'll have it back.
**Ataylor**: So that window is 2:30 to 6.
**Ataylor**: We're good anytime from 2:30 to 6.
**Shooper**: Yeah, he's got it.
**Ataylor**: Oh, when we're doing that temporary power, there was a lot of conversation for Greenwood on.
**Ataylor**: On a flex conduit versus rigid conduit, but I would assume we're just using the same conduit that's there.
**Ataylor**: We're not running a flex conduit, are we?
**Shooper**: Yes.
**Speaker 3**: Yes, this is Mario.
**Speaker 3**: Yes, we're running the flex conduit temporarily.
**Speaker 3**: And then whenever we're able to tie in the permanent fixtures, the new ones, we'll run all the new conduit to.
**Speaker 3**: To plan pretty much to get that powered on, and we'll get rid of that flex conduit.
**Sglaze**: Mario, you're just using like, Seal tight, right?
**Speaker 3**: We're using mc and we're getting as high as we can to get.
**Speaker 3**: Make sure there's no damage or anything like that.
**Speaker 3**: And we're using J boxes to separate the circuits.
**Sglaze**: So I'll be really clear on flex conduit versus like.
**Sglaze**: Like.
**Sglaze**: So MC is just regular MC cable.
**Sglaze**: You're not running that MC cable in anything, correct?
**Speaker 3**: No.
**Sglaze**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: That.
**Sglaze**: That wouldn't be to code.
**Sglaze**: Okay.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, it's.
**Speaker 3**: It's armored cable.
**Speaker 3**: I mean, It's.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, it's.
**Speaker 3**: It's perfectly fine for this use.
**Speaker 3**: I'm.
**Speaker 3**: We're just going to use it temporarily.
**Sglaze**: And then when we do our permanent lighting, we will have everything in conduit.
**Speaker 3**: Yes, Correct.
**Sglaze**: Yeah.
**Sglaze**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Okay, Scott.
**Ataylor**: I mean, I don't see any issues with that.
**Ataylor**: Rob kept mentioning we were using a flex conduit for Greenwood, but I think that was.
**Ataylor**: He said he doesn't needed that rigid conduit for, you know, final state.
**Ataylor**: I don't see an issue with.
**Ataylor**: With using.
**Ataylor**: Using that temporarily, do you?
**Shooper**: Yeah, no, I mean a temporary.
**Shooper**: I mean to, to.
**Shooper**: To run all that and put it into actual conduit.
**Shooper**: You're at in time and a bunch of unnecessary money to it.
**Sglaze**: Yeah, it's.
**Sglaze**: It's not worth it.
**Ataylor**: Yep, understood.
**Ataylor**: I just.
**Ataylor**: As long as we've got rigid, you know, when we go live with it, I'm good.
**Sglaze**: Mario's a stud too.
**Sglaze**: He'll make it look pretty.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, we're getting a uniform.
**Speaker 3**: Correct.
**Shooper**: Hey guys, I.
**Shooper**: I'll get back on here in just a second.
**Shooper**: I got a call coming in.
**Shooper**: I think he's a truck driver.
**Ataylor**: So then Tomorrow morning at 6:00 we're not going to be able to.
**Ataylor**: I kind of need Scott on for this part.
**Ataylor**: Basically going in D mod, we're going to put wire deck at the end of each one of those shelving rows.
**Ataylor**: They can't use that travel path outside of the shelves.
**Ataylor**: And I think we need to do that at 6am then.
**Ataylor**: But I just want to make sure.
**Ataylor**: But two days is.
**Ataylor**: I mean, two times.
**Ataylor**: If we're using the downtime Wednesday morning and Thursday morning, I think we'll be good.
**Ataylor**: In good shape there.
**Ataylor**: I thought Mario was saying it could take four days or so.
**Ataylor**: It.
**Sglaze**: Yeah, no, it'll take two days.
**Sglaze**: That's why we're going in early.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, I appreciate it.
**Sglaze**: I can't.
**Sglaze**: We can't have it string along for four days.
**Sglaze**: We gotta get on the demo.
**Sglaze**: So I pushed for.
**Sglaze**: I pushed for one day, but they can't get it done in one day.
**Sglaze**: So we're gonna do.
**Sglaze**: We're new Wednesday, Thursday morning, Drew.
**Ataylor**: All right.
**Ataylor**: I don't think I'll go over the rest.
**Ataylor**: I think with Scott gotta be back.
**Ataylor**: Scott, you're on mute if you're back.
**Shooper**: Oh, yeah, There you go.
**Shooper**: Yeah.
**Shooper**: It was our truck.
**Shooper**: Truck driver with our second high troll truck.
**Ataylor**: Gotcha.
**Ataylor**: So, Scott, basically tomorrow morning they're going to come in before 6am and, and start running temp power to level one.
**Ataylor**: And then we'll start.
**Ataylor**: There's some demo that needs to be done in row in level one.
**Ataylor**: Right.
**Ataylor**: So we'd look to do that right.
**Shooper**: After at 6am basically getting that conduit down or whatever.
**Shooper**: When.
**Shooper**: When is.
**Shooper**: When is Roberto and his guys coming in to start demo?
**Sglaze**: I thought we had till Tuesday, Drew.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, I want to be done Tuesday.
**Ataylor**: By Tuesday.
**Shooper**: Yeah.
**Sglaze**: We'll have to get ahead of them.
**Sglaze**: I know.
**Sglaze**: It's my understanding, right, that we've already lowered the seaside.
**Sglaze**: Correct.
**Shooper**: Yeah.
**Shooper**: C.
**Shooper**: C side's already good.
**Shooper**: It's just a D side.
**Shooper**: And remember, we still have sprinkler pipe.
**Shooper**: I, I.
**Shooper**: Either that sprinkler pipe comes out or the heads get taken out.
**Shooper**: I can't remember which.
**Shooper**: What.
**Shooper**: What we took.
**Sglaze**: We took.
**Sglaze**: We capped it and then we rested it on.
**Sglaze**: There's a.
**Sglaze**: Some cross or some.
**Sglaze**: Some Y bracing.
**Sglaze**: I remember that we would rest it on it.
**Sglaze**: We just left it there so they don't mess with it.
**Sglaze**: It was one sprinkler line, and then we just reinstall it once.
**Sglaze**: Once they're done.
**Sglaze**: That way we have a live system still.
**Shooper**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: So at 6:00am Scott, do we need to block off the aisles with wire deck then?
**Shooper**: You know, until they start actually doing demo on the floor and stuff like that, I don't see any reason to impede the progress and traffic of the pickers and stuff like that.
**Shooper**: We'll just have the guys where they're working locally immediately.
**Shooper**: Locally, you know, put some caution tape up or, you know, something to block them from being able to walk out underneath them.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: I told Michael I was thinking it was going to be 7 or 8am Tomorrow is when we block access to that.
**Ataylor**: You know, he's going to want exact minute that it's done.
**Shooper**: Well, I, I don't think that we need to block access, per se, until Roberto and the guys get here to start dismantling the.
**Shooper**: The pick mod itself.
**Shooper**: Yeah.
**Shooper**: Because it's just.
**Shooper**: They're going to be working off of ladders like up in the.
**Shooper**: Up in the second level and stuff.
**Shooper**: They're just going to be working off of ladders right there.
**Shooper**: Taking stuff down.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Shooper**: I'm sure Michael's going to want the least amount of impact to their.
**Shooper**: To their stuff as possible.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: All right, I'm going to give him a call now then.
**Ataylor**: Okay, so let's.
**Ataylor**: So I'll say basically 6am Tuesday morning is when we're going to put that wire deck up first thing Tuesday morning.
**Shooper**: Yeah, whenever.
**Shooper**: Because it's it's going to be Roberto and his guys that are doing it because they're going to take the wire decks out of the.
**Shooper**: Out of the shelving and actually put it up.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: Okay, cool.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: All right.
**Ataylor**: So, I mean, it should be pretty minimal impact on the DC until that happens.
**Ataylor**: All right, I think I've got everything.
**Ataylor**: You good, Scott?
**Shooper**: All right.
**Shooper**: Yeah.
**Shooper**: Can you hang out for a minute after it all this?
**Ataylor**: Yep.
**Shooper**: And, Steve, you're more than welcome to hang around, too.
**Sglaze**: See you guys.
**Ataylor**: But see it.
**Shooper**: Can you give users open that up?
**Shooper**: Yeah.
**Shooper**: All right, guys.
**Ataylor**: Hey, their AI notetaker is still on, so.
