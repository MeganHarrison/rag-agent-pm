## Transcript
**Sclevenger**: See if.
**Sclevenger**: We'll see if Glendon or Sean join from the Neiman side.
**Sclevenger**: Give them a couple minutes.
**Cmortensen**: All the VAVs are up on this phase.
**Cmortensen**: We've landed all the MC cable to them.
**Cmortensen**: They're getting all the ductwork and adapters first thing in the morning.
**Cmortensen**: So we'll finish this phase up tomorrow.
**Sclevenger**: Good work, sir.
**Sclevenger**: See, I knew they could do it.
**Cmortensen**: I had to rip them this morning.
**Sclevenger**: But they just, they just need a little kick in the butt.
**Sclevenger**: All right, this is, this will be.
**Sclevenger**: Yeah.
**Sclevenger**: Sean joining.
**Sclevenger**: So good.
**Sclevenger**: Hey, Sean.
**Bclymer**: Hey.
**Ahuettl**: I hear you and Glendon got to have a good chat yesterday.
**Sclevenger**: Yeah, we did.
**Sclevenger**: What's up, Glendon?
**Sclevenger**: You made it back, huh?
**Bclymer**: I did make it back.
**Sclevenger**: There we go.
**Sclevenger**: Well, yeah, I enjoyed getting to chat with you yesterday.
**Sclevenger**: It was nice to always meet in person finally.
**Sclevenger**: I feel like every time I'm on this call with you guys, I'm in the car, so I apologize for that.
**Ahuettl**: Well, you're doing your job.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah, you're right.
**Ahuettl**: You are on the.
**Ahuettl**: In your car almost every time.
**Sclevenger**: That, that'll, that'll change here.
**Sclevenger**: Here next week, most likely.
**Sclevenger**: So, that being said, I do have my notes sitting right here.
**Sclevenger**: First things first, Sean.
**Sclevenger**: I, I, I got some clarification on what the city's going to want as far as address goes.
**Ahuettl**: Okay.
**Sclevenger**: Okay.
**Sclevenger**: So because we're tying in to the existing fire alarm, the fire marshal, Carmel Fire, wants us to just do suite numbers.
**Ahuettl**: Okay.
**Sclevenger**: And so, that being said, that being said, I owe them basically what suite numbers we're going to use.
**Sclevenger**: So I am assuming you want Harvest Market to be sweet 100, correct?
**Bclymer**: Correct.
**Sclevenger**: And then we can either do suite 200 for Hero or not Hero for whatever the one that's unoccupied is.
**Sclevenger**: Yeah, the unoccupied space.
**Sclevenger**: And then we can do suite 300 for FedEx.
**Ahuettl**: Okay.
**Sclevenger**: It's very subjective and totally up to you.
**Sclevenger**: We just need to distinguish between the ones and let them know.
**Ahuettl**: Okay.
**Ahuettl**: I mean, I'm fine with that unless anybody else has any other suggestion.
**Ahuettl**: But that doesn't really matter to me as long as that's exposure with the city.
**Sclevenger**: Yeah.
**Sclevenger**: What do you think, Glendon?
**Bclymer**: Agree with Sean.
**Sclevenger**: Okay, so I will go ahead and tell them.
**Sclevenger**: Harvest Market will be sweet 100.
**Sclevenger**: The future space will be suite 200.
**Sclevenger**: And FedEx being on the end will be suite 300.
**Ahuettl**: Okay.
**Sclevenger**: And I know FedEx was asking the question, too, so I'm assuming that has to do with how they're doing their permitting.
**Sclevenger**: So I'll respond to Molly's email and let her know that they will be suite 300.
**Sclevenger**: And then that's how we'll be able to distinguish when we put the new gas meter in and all the utilities.
**Ahuettl**: Right, right, right.
**Ahuettl**: Okay.
**Sclevenger**: All righty.
**Sclevenger**: So as far as construction schedule goes, we.
**Sclevenger**: Cannon just told me that we.
**Sclevenger**: We passed our footer inspection.
**Sclevenger**: So today we will be pouring the concrete for the footers at the front entrance for those masonry columns.
**Sclevenger**: And then Candon, what else are we going to be pouring with this pour?
**Cmortensen**: We'll be pouring the egress on the left side of the building.
**Sclevenger**: That's right.
**Sclevenger**: Okay.
**Sclevenger**: So we're going to try and get.
**Sclevenger**: Yeah, we'll get that back pad poured and then our next pour, which will probably be next week or maybe.
**Sclevenger**: I don't know.
**Sclevenger**: What were they wanting to do, Canon Friday, they want to pour that.
**Sclevenger**: That entrance or have we not?
**Cmortensen**: Yeah, we're not confirmed, but we're going to take a look at it today.
**Cmortensen**: The plan is to either get it poured tomorrow, inspected and poured tomorrow, or Monday.
**Sclevenger**: Okay.
**Cmortensen**: That way we give that back entrance a little time to harden up.
**Cmortensen**: That way we do have an access point into the building.
**Sclevenger**: Smart.
**Sclevenger**: Smart.
**Sclevenger**: Okay.
**Sclevenger**: So other news on the schedule.
**Sclevenger**: We're finishing drywall right now.
**Sclevenger**: Expected to be done here in the next couple days.
**Sclevenger**: And then we will move right into hanging our ceiling grid.
**Sclevenger**: Yep.
**Cmortensen**: Correct.
**Cmortensen**: We got one more pass on the drywall mud that will be completed tomorrow.
**Cmortensen**: Then we'll come back Monday morning, we'll sand, and then we'll be able to start grid either first thing Tuesday or Wednesday.
**Cmortensen**: It's scheduled for Wednesday, but if we can get a day in early, that's our plan.
**Sclevenger**: Awesome.
**Sclevenger**: Awesome.
**Sclevenger**: We're rolling right along, sticking to that schedule I sent out the other day.
**Sclevenger**: We're going to be at a really good place on the interior here in the next couple weeks, assuming FedEx gets approved for their permit.
**Sclevenger**: I'm still going to push them back a little bit.
**Sclevenger**: But.
**Sclevenger**: But really what.
**Sclevenger**: What our critical thing to.
**Sclevenger**: To be getting done as far as that schedule goes is getting my mason in there, and he can't come in until 9:15.
**Sclevenger**: So that's why you see that schedule pushed back.
**Sclevenger**: I did my best, but we'll.
**Sclevenger**: We'll keep.
**Sclevenger**: We'll keep pushing it to see what we can do.
**Sclevenger**: But for now, it's looking like it's going to be that 10, 7 date I have on there in October.
**Ahuettl**: Okay.
**Sclevenger**: Okay.
**Ahuettl**: Got it.
**Sclevenger**: And the last thing I had to.
**Sclevenger**: To go through, me and Glendon talked about it Yesterday.
**Sclevenger**: I know.
**Sclevenger**: We're going to pull the ad for the lintels out of contingency, Sean.
**Sclevenger**: And then we will settle up on the permit after we see where we're at at the end of the job.
**Sclevenger**: Okay.
**Ahuettl**: And say that again.
**Ahuettl**: The first half.
**Ahuettl**: I missed it.
**Ahuettl**: I couldn't hear it.
**Sclevenger**: So I owe you a change order for the.
**Sclevenger**: For the lintels that Carmel added.
**Sclevenger**: The limestone lintels above the openings.
**Ahuettl**: Okay.
**Sclevenger**: And we're gonna.
**Sclevenger**: We're gonna pull that out of contingency.
**Ahuettl**: Okay.
**Sclevenger**: And then at the end of the job, we have a change order for the permit cost.
**Ahuettl**: Right.
**Sclevenger**: And we're gonna see where we wind up with that contingency.
**Sclevenger**: And then we'll settle up.
**Ahuettl**: Okay.
**Ahuettl**: Okay.
**Ahuettl**: That will work.
**Sclevenger**: Okay.
**Ahuettl**: That will work.
**Sclevenger**: That's all I had on my list.
**Sclevenger**: Do you guys have any questions for us?
**Bclymer**: Do you know the rough schedule of when you're going to want to do the shutdown for the electrical?
**Sclevenger**: Yeah, that's a good question.
**Sclevenger**: So I don't have a date for that yet.
**Sclevenger**: Really.
**Sclevenger**: What I need from you guys is when is the ideal time and then I can get my electrician scheduled.
**Sclevenger**: So, Glendon, when we were looking at that main distribution panel we're pulling the power from, it looked like it was just some RTUs.
**Sclevenger**: I couldn't tell what one of them was, but those are.
**Bclymer**: And then it has two makeup air units on there too.
**Bclymer**: So I will probably put you in contact with our refrigeration guy because they'll probably want to have someone on site when we do that.
**Bclymer**: So it might be best if you could coordinate the timing with him.
**Bclymer**: And then that should take care of that.
**Sclevenger**: Happy to do that.
**Sclevenger**: If you don't mind.
**Sclevenger**: Copy and Candon on that email as well, because he's going to help coordinate that.
**Cmortensen**: Yes, please.
**Sclevenger**: And.
**Sclevenger**: And we'll get with him, see what he's thinking.
**Sclevenger**: And then obviously we.
**Sclevenger**: It needs to make sense to do it after hours.
**Sclevenger**: So it'll either be really early in the morning, but most likely.
**Sclevenger**: I don't know.
**Sclevenger**: When do you guys close?
**Sclevenger**: You know, when that store closes?
**Cmortensen**: Sure.
**Cmortensen**: I can go look at the outreach.
**Bclymer**: I can look it up real quick.
**Ahuettl**: So they're going to be running off of our power.
**Ahuettl**: We're paying their utilities, electric and gas.
**Sclevenger**: No.
**Sclevenger**: So no.
**Sclevenger**: So what we're installing is sub meters, Sean.
**Sclevenger**: And that allows you guys to each month see how much power they're pulling.
**Sclevenger**: Same with the water.
**Sclevenger**: And then you'll have to bill them for that.
**Sclevenger**: Okay.
**Sclevenger**: And we came to that Conclusion early on with Corey, it would be pretty astronomical to run a whole new service to their, to their unit.
**Sclevenger**: And you have plenty of power already in the building, so gas, however, I'm able to modify the existing meter or they can put a second meter bank connected to it and they will be paying the gas bill directly.
**Ahuettl**: Okay.
**Cmortensen**: Looks like the hours here from 6:00am to 10:00pm Yep.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: And it might not have to be outside of store hours or it could be at the tail end or something or, but anyway, I'll put you guys, I'll put Candon and Brian Mitchell, our director of refrigeration and contact and they can work out a time and he can make sure, Brian can make sure.
**Bclymer**: We have one of our guys on site just to make sure when we kick everything back on that everything comes back on.
**Bclymer**: Good.
**Cmortensen**: Perfect.
**Sclevenger**: And we have a little time, so I don't want to like spring it on you guys, but it is good to start.
**Sclevenger**: That's why I wanted to show you yesterday, Glendon.
**Sclevenger**: And it's good to start thinking about it now.
**Sclevenger**: And that way you can get someone out there, we'll get it tied in and we'll be good to go.
**Sclevenger**: We still have to set our panels.
**Sclevenger**: Now that drywall is being finished, we'll start on that.
**Cmortensen**: Yeah, we have, yeah.
**Cmortensen**: Panels are scheduled to be in by Monday as well as the transformer.
**Cmortensen**: Perfect.
**Sclevenger**: Alrighty, guys.
**Sclevenger**: Any other questions?
**Bclymer**: I'm good.
