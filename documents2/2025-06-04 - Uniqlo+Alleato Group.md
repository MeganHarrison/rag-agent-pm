## Transcript
**Aelkarrimy**: Here it is.
**Bclymer**: You just share your screen.
**Jdawson**: Hey, what's going on, everyone?
**Bclymer**: Hello, Matt.
**Bclymer**: How you doing?
**Jdawson**: Well, Jesse, how are you?
**Bclymer**: Excellent.
**Bclymer**: Need to change that permit priority to high number one, Kiba.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And Mike, did you make it over there today to the building permit office?
**Bclymer**: Mike, you're muted.
**Bclymer**: If you're trying to talk.
**Kevin.ly**: I did not make it over there today.
**Kevin.ly**: I talked to Eileen, and still the same.
**Kevin.ly**: Same update as Ahmed sent earlier.
**Mparsons**: Oh, Mike is trying to go to Eileen.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So, Yasuke, what I did was I went to Marianne first as a step one.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So usually landlords have some sort of relationship since they have renovations going on, they have some relationships with examiners and inspectors within the dov.
**Jdawson**: So I called Marianne out of good faith just to see if.
**Jdawson**: If they do, and it turns out they do.
**Jdawson**: So she said she's going to have someone that is.
**Jdawson**: That has a very close relationship with the examiner to see if we can push them a little bit from the landlord side.
**Jdawson**: And then she also asked me to request if the general contractor can send their project manager just as out of good faith, just to, you know, build a relationship, try to push them a little bit better and let them know that we kind of needed by end of week, not.
**Jdawson**: Not beyond that point, but today, basically, the sad part of this conversation is that the fire suppression review hasn't even started, and that's the bulk of the project.
**Bryan.wagar**: So.
**Bclymer**: I'm sorry.
**Jdawson**: I was like, Eileen, you know, you mentioned seven to eight business days for the permit.
**Jdawson**: We're going into two months.
**Jdawson**: And she said, I apologize.
**Jdawson**: It's not.
**Jdawson**: It's out of my hand.
**Jdawson**: We don't.
**Jdawson**: We're very understaffed right now.
**Jdawson**: Everyone's on PTO or sick.
**Jdawson**: And I told her, but.
**Jdawson**: But we kind of need a timeline.
**Jdawson**: So she was supposed to call me back with a timeline, but she hasn't done so.
**Jdawson**: So I'll follow up with her.
**Jdawson**: Unless.
**Jdawson**: Kaba.
**Jdawson**: I don't know if one of you guys called.
**Jdawson**: Did she give you guys, like, somewhat of a timeline or a rough timeline?
**Kevin.ly**: No.
**Aelkarrimy**: I don't know if you saw my message.
**Aelkarrimy**: You were supposed to send me a contact.
**Jdawson**: I didn't send it.
**Mparsons**: I took this.
**Jdawson**: I'm so sorry.
**Jdawson**: I took the screenshot and I thought I texted it to you.
**Jdawson**: I'll send it to you right after this.
**Jdawson**: I'll send it to you right now.
**Aelkarrimy**: I was going to find out if Mike was back there and he could stop by on Friday, but he's.
**Aelkarrimy**: I think he's in Virginia today, but going Back there soon.
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah, I can stop by Friday.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: Mike, you're stopping where on Friday?
**Mparsons**: The DOB to dob.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Mparsons**: I talked with Brandon this evening and he said that DoB is closed from Thursday to Friday.
**Jdawson**: Friday?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, they don't operate on Friday.
**Jdawson**: So I told Kaba to confirm with the DOB when they call them if they are operating on Friday.
**Jdawson**: And I think they're just waiting to get a hold of Eileen to figure out what they should.
**Jdawson**: They should pop in.
**Jdawson**: So definitely confirm if they are operating on Friday, which I'm pretty sure they're.
**Jdawson**: They don't.
**Jdawson**: So you might need to do this on Monday or tomorrow if you guys are able to.
**Mparsons**: And also, Brandon already stopped by today to dob.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: Did you.
**Mparsons**: Did you heard anything from Brandon?
**Kevin.ly**: Mike, I did not check and see if he.
**Kevin.ly**: I shared with him the address and confirmed that they.
**Kevin.ly**: That she was in the office today.
**Kevin.ly**: But I did not hear back on if he went over there today or not.
**Mparsons**: Please follow up.
**Mparsons**: That's something.
**Bclymer**: That's something he would do.
**Bclymer**: I'll call him after a meeting and just verify.
**Bclymer**: But.
**Kevin.ly**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: I wouldn't doubt anyone over there.
**Jdawson**: I could have sworn he's going to Japan today is what he told me.
**Mparsons**: No, no, that's.
**Aelkarrimy**: That.
**Mparsons**: That's not correct.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: Well, next on your list, we had temp fence materials delivered.
**Bclymer**: We had the electricians out there.
**Bclymer**: Do you have an item on there?
**Bclymer**: There was a question about the location of the panels.
**Jdawson**: So Yasuke, I know that you sent an email and I followed up with you with regards to the options that we discussed yesterday.
**Mparsons**: Yes.
**Mparsons**: I'm going to reply back to you.
**Mparsons**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jdawson**: Were you able to confirm with the warehouse folks where or like what our approach should be when it comes to the two options that were presented.
**Mparsons**: Just for the space.
**Mparsons**: Right.
**Mparsons**: Spacing.
**Mparsons**: What we wanted to do after the fans gone for the.
**Mparsons**: The sublease area.
**Jdawson**: I'm sorry, can you repeat that?
**Mparsons**: I'll just let you know which option we wanted to go within today.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah, that would be great.
**Jdawson**: So then this way.
**Jdawson**: Once Brian from Henderson receives that information, that will kind of start their.
**Jdawson**: Their.
**Jdawson**: Their process to update the drawings.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Relocation of existing plan A.
**Jdawson**: Six days.
**Bclymer**: How is.
**Bclymer**: How is the floor grinding going?
**Kevin.ly**: It's going well from my point of view.
**Kevin.ly**: Sukay.
**Kevin.ly**: I don't know if I have any updates for that.
**Mparsons**: Yeah, it looks good.
**Mparsons**: Having no problem at all.
**Jdawson**: When do we anticipate the markings on the slab with the racks?
**Bryan.wagar**: I will confirm with the team, but the markets on the floor generally go in a week before the racking starts.
**Bryan.wagar**: So the end of July.
**Jdawson**: And Jesse, based off of that feedback, I know that per my discussions with Brandon, is that he's expecting that we mark the at least where the racks land.
**Jdawson**: This way we can run our lines for the light installation.
**Jdawson**: And I saw that you have the relocation for plan B and Plan A618 and for Plan A, July 3rd.
**Jdawson**: And Joe, I'm not sure.
**Jdawson**: Did you say end of July or like the beginning of July?
**Bryan.wagar**: End of July.
**Bryan.wagar**: We start rack in first week of August.
**Bryan.wagar**: So the markings on the floor would go down generally a week before we start.
**Bclymer**: That's why we had some discussions early on.
**Bclymer**: Like, typically electricians, like, they'll rough in a light.
**Bclymer**: I don't know how these are wired, but there'll be a whip coming from a box to go to the actual light.
**Bclymer**: So there's a little adjustment there.
**Bclymer**: And that's why we were saying, like, until the racks are laid out, we, we can't get exactly, you know, because there's, you know, nothing to lay out off of.
**Bclymer**: So if they go in, they should be getting most of their main rough ends done and get the light close to where it's going to be and then have some adjustment there.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, I think that's what Brandon was saying on a previous call that, you know, you kind of rough it in.
**Bryan.wagar**: That's probably what this is.
**Bryan.wagar**: Relocation of lights.
**Bryan.wagar**: They will drop where around the space where it's going to be.
**Bryan.wagar**: And then as soon as we spray on the ground where everything's going to be, they can do this while the rack is going up because this won't take.
**Bryan.wagar**: They'll be way ahead of where we're working in.
**Jdawson**: Gotcha.
**Mparsons**: But both of those of rack installation, like rack markup and lighting markup kind of things will not be like any problem.
**Mparsons**: If we followed like cat file or like.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, he could get really close to.
**Mparsons**: Doesn't change for like 5 or 10ft.
**Mparsons**: Right?
**Kevin.ly**: Just.
**Bryan.wagar**: No, yeah, yeah, yeah, no, I, I, this, it's not going to be a problem because, I mean, hell, this says it takes six days to do each of these.
**Bryan.wagar**: And it's going to take us six days to do, you know, three rows of racks.
**Bryan.wagar**: You know, if that.
**Bryan.wagar**: So they'll, they'll complete all this before we have, you know, three rows of rack up.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Bryan.wagar**: So they'll probably rough it by.
**Bryan.wagar**: Rough it, pull the cables, which is the hardest part, and, and then have them laid out ready to go.
**Bclymer**: Some other another thing to coordinate you know, we kind of laid out and got some more information from our electricians on the aisle.
**Bclymer**: They would need to get from the main gear room back to the new panels.
**Bclymer**: Isuke, are you still.
**Bclymer**: Are you just going to have a guard posted there or is that related?
**Mparsons**: That one.
**Mparsons**: We have to coordinate when.
**Mparsons**: Like usual, when you guys kind of work.
**Mparsons**: Because we are using those areas for the operation.
**Mparsons**: And we cannot, like, do the operation based on the area you proposed us, which was like.
**Mparsons**: Which was like 13ft or something from the wall, as I remember.
**Mparsons**: So I think.
**Mparsons**: I think we have to coordinate when IRGOD is going to work.
**Mparsons**: Maybe we should propose like late at night or early in the morning, which we're not operating the warehouse, so we have to coordinate those kind of things a little more detail.
**Mparsons**: Not to affect our operation in the warehouse.
**Jdawson**: Specifically outside of the fenced area.
**Jdawson**: Right, Yusuke?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Mparsons**: Yes.
**Mparsons**: The fenced area to the powerhouse area.
**Bclymer**: Correct.
**Bclymer**: And even though they're not running the whole length of it, at any point, you're saying you have to cross that entire length on that end of the building.
**Bclymer**: You got to be able to get by from one end to the other every day.
**Mparsons**: Yes, yes.
**Bclymer**: Because it sounds like the.
**Bclymer**: I mean, the bulk of the width.
**Bclymer**: I guess they're going to have two lifts in there.
**Bclymer**: I was thinking they would use one.
**Bclymer**: And then the spools of cabling is what eats up all that space.
**Bclymer**: So we'll have to get.
**Bclymer**: We'll coordinate that.
**Bclymer**: We'll see how we can.
**Mparsons**: Yeah.
**Mparsons**: Based on.
**Mparsons**: Based on the width you informed me, which was 13ft, as I remember, based on that width.
**Mparsons**: It's kind of hard to do it in the operation.
**Mparsons**: Operation, you know, daytime, when we operate the warehouse.
**Bclymer**: Okay, well, we got time.
**Bclymer**: We'll get that coordinated, and we'll see how that.
**Bclymer**: If it turns into night work for a few weeks and.
**Mparsons**: Yeah.
**Mparsons**: Or can you minimize the width of the workspace from the wall to.
**Bclymer**: That's what I'm thinking.
**Bclymer**: If they maybe staggered their spools so they were all one behind the other, instead of.
**Bclymer**: I think they may be thinking they're gonna stack them side by side.
**Bclymer**: So we just need to talk to the electrician too, because I think they would do a lot of different things if they could avoid night work.
**Bclymer**: So we'll get with them and coordinate that.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: I'll also check internally, like, how much widths we need to operate in that part.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: And again that, you know, there you got.
**Bryan.wagar**: Oops.
**Bclymer**: Trying to break a glass.
**Bclymer**: I mean, you got 200 linear foot.
**Bclymer**: But they're only going to be working in a 20 foot section at a time.
**Bclymer**: And I don't know what that looks like in there.
**Bclymer**: If it's one solid aisle or does it go in and out, you know.
**Bclymer**: So they may need a 13 foot wide section, but you know, they're only, you know, that's only for a 20 foot portion of where they're working, if that makes sense.
**Mparsons**: Yeah, but we have to go all the way through that iron.
**Mparsons**: So even if just the one portion.
**Bclymer**: Okay, okay.
**Bclymer**: That's why I didn't know if there's pinch points along that way where it's like 20 foot wide, one section, but then it gets down to 20 or 15 foot, that makes it a problem.
**Bclymer**: So I just like to explore all the options to make it work for everybody.
**Kevin.ly**: And Yusuke, correct me if I'm wrong, but you know, early morning be much preferred than, you know, if say we were to do it for a few hours at the earliest point, maybe six to nine before too much work was going on in that area.
**Kevin.ly**: That would be better than say, afternoon, correct?
**Bclymer**: Well, if that's the case, you know, they would, you know, even.
**Bclymer**: It's a lot easier if they come in at 4am if that's something we can work out with security and they work from 4 to 4 to 8 or something like that, where they can get it knocked out, cleaned up, and out of the way by the time you start, you know, they.
**Bclymer**: That would probably work better too.
**Kevin.ly**: Gotcha.
**Jdawson**: Yasuke, do you think you can gather input on that?
**Jdawson**: Just to see if it's possible that the general contractor accesses the site at 4am to try to get the stuff.
**Jdawson**: This.
**Jdawson**: This scope of work that's outside of the fenced area, within those specific windows over the course of a few days.
**Mparsons**: As much as possible.
**Mparsons**: We wanted to do within.
**Mparsons**: Within the normal timeline.
**Mparsons**: But the first option is to minimize the width from the wall, the working space from the width to the width from the wall.
**Mparsons**: Second option is to consider when we're going to do those work.
**Bclymer**: Mike, do you or Yasuke, could you send us some pictures of what that looks like through that backside?
**Kevin.ly**: I can send pictures.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Hey, Caba.
**Jdawson**: By the way, I sent you the.
**Jdawson**: The phone number for Eileen in the chat here.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yes, I see it.
**Aelkarrimy**: Thanks.
**Jdawson**: No.
**Bclymer**: Next on your submittals, is the fire sprinkler.
**Bclymer**: Is that last submittal good?
**Bclymer**: I think they were missing a check valve for one of the risers.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yes, we did send that in.
**Aelkarrimy**: And the electrical came back yesterday.
**Aelkarrimy**: And it was missing some stuff.
**Aelkarrimy**: So the electrician is working on that.
**Aelkarrimy**: Spoke with them today, so they will send it over tomorrow.
**Aelkarrimy**: And for the plumbing, we haven't heard back yet.
**Aelkarrimy**: So those are still being reviewed.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I just pinged my team on that plumbing one since I'm showing that in our system is overdue.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So we'll try and get that back in the next two days by end of the week.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay, thank you.
**Aelkarrimy**: And for billing, he sent the first billing out to the owners on the 27th.
**Aelkarrimy**: I think that's about it.
**Aelkarrimy**: Last week we mostly discussed just that presentation we went over.
**Aelkarrimy**: So some of these agenda items we didn't really get to talk to talk about.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So I guess main thing like you know, the flooring, as long as the grinding is going okay.
**Bclymer**: There's really nothing on our end as far as anything that's going to delay or hold us up.
**Jdawson**: Jesse, I think in the beginning of the agenda it says that the fence was delivered and installed, correct?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, they finished that up this morning.
**Bclymer**: Is everything.
**Bclymer**: Do you have any issues with anything on the fancy suitcase or is it look good?
**Mparsons**: Actually we have to get some chains and some like lock.
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah.
**Kevin.ly**: Yes, I talked to Ted today.
**Kevin.ly**: He got him today.
**Kevin.ly**: Should be going on today and then I'm back on site on Friday.
**Kevin.ly**: I'll confirm that and get a key.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: Mark, so you're coming back tomorrow?
**Kevin.ly**: I won't be on site until Friday.
**Mparsons**: Next Friday?
**Kevin.ly**: No.
**Jdawson**: Two days?
**Mparsons**: No.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And the keys, who all do we give these keys to?
**Bclymer**: Like copies of the gate keys?
**Bclymer**: Is that one that Michael keep a copy of for our people and then the rest go to your security guys.
**Kevin.ly**: Right?
**Kevin.ly**: That's.
**Kevin.ly**: That's what I've been hearing from them.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: Is there anything else?
**Mparsons**: Oh, sorry Mike.
**Mparsons**: I didn't see any of the fences connected to the sublease permanent fence.
**Mparsons**: Is it already there?
**Kevin.ly**: Sorry, you talking about the connection to the existing fence?
**Mparsons**: Yes.
**Mparsons**: Yes.
**Kevin.ly**: Okay.
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah.
**Kevin.ly**: Right.
**Kevin.ly**: I'm not.
**Kevin.ly**: I'm not sure if you came back over to the area after we talked to Brandon, but it got installed like right after that.
**Mparsons**: Oh really?
**Mparsons**: Oh, okay.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: Stay.
**Aelkarrimy**: Anything else?
**Jdawson**: Yusuke, do you have anything you want to go over?
**Mparsons**: Yeah, I'm good on my side, but let me comment back for like daily report or weekly report?
**Mparsons**: You're going to report us every day or weekly?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, everyday work's done on site or Mike's on site, he'll send the daily report and then he'll wrap it up on Fridays with a photo report.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: And the One you're sharing in the screen is the.
**Mparsons**: The daily report.
**Mparsons**: Right.
**Bclymer**: This is just an agenda.
**Mparsons**: Oh, this is just an agenda.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: And I think you already share Daily Report to our side, but please include me, Mine Uekita in the data report.
**Kevin.ly**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And Kevin Chair also.
**Jdawson**: Just keep the architects on that, too.
**Jdawson**: Just so then we know what's going on.
**Jdawson**: And if we need to be on site, we'll definitely be on site because there's some dates that we want to hit.
**Jdawson**: Once we get to a certain point where TPG starts to come to the site, there are days where Henderson will be coming as well.
**Jdawson**: And then structural is.
**Jdawson**: Whenever you guys need them on site, you can request that right away, but they'll just come in towards the final.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Kevin.ly**: The daily Reports.
**Bclymer**: You're breaking up, Mike.
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: You're breaking up a little bit.
**Kevin.ly**: Sorry.
**Kevin.ly**: Can you hear me?
**Bclymer**: We can hear you now.
**Kevin.ly**: Okay.
**Kevin.ly**: The daily reports are done through Job Planner.
**Kevin.ly**: So unless we want to change that, we'll just have to make sure everybody that needs to be on it is on there.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Mike, just go in and add them to the distribution list and Job Planner, and then it'll send out to them.
**Kevin.ly**: Okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Only other option would probably be to put together a weekly report.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Weekly progress report.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, the weekly report we do also.
**Bclymer**: Then he emails that.
**Bclymer**: That's a different type.
**Bclymer**: You know, we don't do it out of Job Planner.
**Bclymer**: We actually put together a report to recap the week and then add some photos to it.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: That's typically what we look at, Ahmed, is we'll just follow the weekly report and try to identify.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I don't think we need access to the dailies.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: You, Suka, do you have any other questions or comments or concerns at this time?
**Mparsons**: Not in here, but Henderson.
**Mparsons**: Brian, I would like to talk to you a little bit after closing this meeting.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Sure.
**Mparsons**: In Amitu.
**Jdawson**: Gotcha.
**Aelkarrimy**: All right.
**Aelkarrimy**: There's nothing else.
**Aelkarrimy**: We'll end it here.
**Bryan.wagar**: All right.
**Bryan.wagar**: Appreciate it, y' all.
**Bryan.wagar**: Thank you.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Thanks, everyone.
**Bclymer**: Thanks, everybody.
**Mparsons**: Thank you.
**Mparsons**: Brian, I wanted to ask you about the.
**Mparsons**: The oils come off from the compressor.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: The reason why.
