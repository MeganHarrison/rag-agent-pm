## Transcript
**Bclymer**: All right, everyone.
**Bclymer**: How's everyone doing?
**Fnjie**: Good.
**Justin**: How are you?
**Asupit**: Hi.
**Bclymer**: Not too shabby.
**Bclymer**: I think we're almost there in the finish line.
**Bclymer**: So this is just a really quick update status meeting that we want to talk about.
**Bclymer**: We're pretty much close to finishing.
**Bclymer**: I think our concurring is just doing his final review of everything, so it's going to probably leave some comments.
**Bclymer**: We're going to kind of go over all through his comments and try to clarify as much as we can.
**Bclymer**: But if there's anything that we can't address ourselves, we'll reach out to Fatima and the team just to get some clarifications.
**Bclymer**: But we're almost there.
**Bclymer**: We sent you the draft financials.
**Bclymer**: We just want to know if there's any questions, any comments from you guys.
**Bclymer**: Let us know if we want to update anything.
**Bclymer**: You can send this over as soon as possible, any updates or comments that you want to update, and then we can update it as soon as possible.
**Bclymer**: I think we do have a few.
**Kjin**: Sorry, one second.
**Kjin**: Adrian, I know, I know you're not familiar with the financials, but that's information about the company to take your best stab at it.
**Kjin**: Read what's in there, make sure everything looks right.
**Kjin**: We want to make sure we're not saying something that's inaccurate or misleading.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah.
**Mcalcetero**: Fatima and Justin are gonna look at it first and then I'll look at it after they review it.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Kjin**: Because we'll need your.
**Kjin**: Your approval to finalize before we're done.
**Justin**: Yep.
**Kjin**: Go ahead, Adrian.
**Justin**: Sorry.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: And then I think we just have just one open item and it's related to the financial statements as well.
**Bclymer**: I think it's related to warranties.
**Bclymer**: We had that highlighted.
**Bclymer**: We just want to get a little more understanding of if there's any potential warranties in your contracts.
**Bclymer**: If you had a standard agreement or a standard document where we can kind of review.
**Mcalcetero**: The subs are the ones that warranty since we don't self perform.
**Bclymer**: Oh, okay.
**Bclymer**: So subs.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So you don't provide any.
**Kjin**: Yeah, so we can just take that.
**Kjin**: Take that out of the financials.
**Bclymer**: Okay, will do.
**Bclymer**: Other than that, I don't.
**Bclymer**: I believe there's no other open items unless Kevin has anything specific.
**Asupit**: Yeah.
**Asupit**: Just one more question about one of our sample testings for job cost.
**Asupit**: Brandon, Like I mentioned in the email, there was a 1,13,000 of the purchase from the eBay.
**Asupit**: That is for the job core Mark LLC SLC, which we purchased in March.
**Asupit**: So we're just.
**Kjin**: Kevin, we just want to know what it Is Brandon, we don't necessarily need an invoice or a receipt.
**Kjin**: So it's give them the job code.
**Kjin**: It's related to and.
**Asupit**: Yeah.
**Justin**: And the date.
**Asupit**: The job job code is 24107 and the job name is Core mark.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, it's a watch.
**Mcalcetero**: So, I mean, you can write it off however you want.
**Justin**: It's a watch.
**Mcalcetero**: Correct.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Kjin**: Definitely a distribution.
**Kjin**: Do we have any more of those that you're aware of, Brandon, or Fatima, in cost right now?
**Fnjie**: No, I reclassed everything that needed to be reclassed in 2024.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Kjin**: And then, Brandon, if it's probably best practice to distribute stuff to yourself personally first and then.
**Kjin**: I know, yeah, you had a nice purchase there at the end of 2024.
**Kjin**: Congratulations.
**Kjin**: Very nice.
**Kjin**: But usually you want to transfer that over to your personal and then make it personal.
**Kjin**: That's just the best practice.
**Kjin**: You can do whatever you want.
**Mcalcetero**: Nope, Appreciate it.
**Bclymer**: One thing, Kevin, too.
**Bclymer**: We do have all of the cost detail, so let's just double check to see if there's anything related to ebay.
**Bclymer**: I'm assuming there's.
**Bclymer**: Like, for ebay, there shouldn't be any construction costs related to that, right?
**Bclymer**: Correct, Brandon.
**Mcalcetero**: I mean, I wouldn't say not anything because if we're in a jam for some reason, like, and we got to buy something online, like, oh, okay, you know, it does have.
**Mcalcetero**: I mean, like, you know, we will buy stuff on Amazon, Alibaba, ebay.
**Mcalcetero**: It doesn't really matter.
**Mcalcetero**: Like if again, if we need a sprinkler head, right.
**Mcalcetero**: Because something broke or whatever, we gotta hurry up.
**Mcalcetero**: Like, we'll buy it after market all day.
**Mcalcetero**: That doesn't happen often.
**Mcalcetero**: But I don't want to sit here and say zero.
**Bclymer**: Sure.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: We'll double check to see what the total amount is.
**Kjin**: And yeah, let's just see what the exposure is first.
**Mcalcetero**: And so I just.
**Mcalcetero**: I just responded and Chris is.
**Mcalcetero**: Lilla with McComb, is the guy that sent that form.
**Mcalcetero**: He's the actual coo.
**Mcalcetero**: Because Scott was like, I can't sign this.
**Mcalcetero**: I gotta send it up.
**Mcalcetero**: Because the verbiage.
**Mcalcetero**: Whatever.
**Mcalcetero**: Anyway, so he'll.
**Mcalcetero**: I included him on that email, so, you know, he'll respond to that.
**Mcalcetero**: And then outside of that, I mean, there.
**Mcalcetero**: There's.
**Mcalcetero**: Is there.
**Mcalcetero**: There's nothing really else that you guys need from us, correct?
**Justin**: That's right.
**Kjin**: Yeah.
**Kjin**: We're so.
**Kjin**: From everybody on this call, we're basically done.
**Kjin**: I'm done.
**Kjin**: We're just waiting for the final QC reviewer to give us any comments.
**Kjin**: We may have some questions we need your help on and then we'll finalize the financials, assuming you guys agree with everything in there.
**Kjin**: So that, that's really.
**Kjin**: So the goal here is to be done in the next couple days and put this behind our backs.
**Kjin**: Gotcha.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay.
**Mcalcetero**: And then as far as.
**Mcalcetero**: So we're thinking this week will be done, right?
**Kjin**: Yeah.
**Kjin**: Again, if QC doesn't come back with.
**Justin**: Anything major, then yes, absolutely.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Mcalcetero**: Because we'll, we'll go ahead and finalize and get ready to submit our, our paperwork to the state.
**Kjin**: Yep, yep.
**Kjin**: So, yeah, those financials, Brandon, and even more important for you to look at because I'm sure they're going to peek at that stuff.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah.
**Mcalcetero**: Like I said, team and Justin are going to review it.
**Mcalcetero**: That way they can catch anything.
**Mcalcetero**: And then when they say they're good, then I'll.
**Mcalcetero**: I'll do my final.
**Justin**: Perfect.
**Justin**: Perfect.
**Asupit**: Brandon, we just received the email that you forwarded to the Chris.
**Asupit**: I guess that's the person who signed in the letter.
**Asupit**: So if you don't mind, can I just forward this email to the Chris again with attaching those signed letters to confirm?
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, yeah.
**Mcalcetero**: If you want to reply to all and attach them.
**Justin**: Sure.
**Asupit**: Yeah, yeah, sure.
**Asupit**: Thank you.
