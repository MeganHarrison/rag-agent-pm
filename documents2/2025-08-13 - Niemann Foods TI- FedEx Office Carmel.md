## Transcript
**Ataylor**: Hey, jdawson.
**Blake.schneider**: Hi.
**Blake.schneider**: Good morning.
**Ataylor**: Sorry I'm a little bit late.
**Blake.schneider**: That's okay.
**Ataylor**: Are you needing anything?
**Blake.schneider**: So, honestly, I just touched base with Tim right before I hopped on here.
**Blake.schneider**: I think the only thing that we're really needing right now is maybe like a clear.
**Blake.schneider**: Let me see, let me see.
**Blake.schneider**: So a clear definition of scope of work from fedex.
**Blake.schneider**: Essentially where our scope is going to end and the fedex electricians are going to pick up.
**Blake.schneider**: I know Tim spoke with AJ on site and that there was still maybe some confusion if that's the right word or.
**Blake.schneider**: Or just a defined scope of work needed still needs to be kind of homed in.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, I know on our meeting with fedex yesterday, AJ asked that question and we're just leaving them junction boxes for their equipment.
**Ataylor**: So I know that AJ is working on that.
**Ataylor**: Let me get with him.
**Ataylor**: And we really define where we're leaving it off at.
**Blake.schneider**: Okay.
**Blake.schneider**: Okay, that sounds good.
**Blake.schneider**: And then something else that we just want to kind of stay on top of.
**Blake.schneider**: I know that framing is still in the works, so we're not really ready for a shutdown tie in yet.
**Blake.schneider**: But when we are ready, I know we need to kind of get that coordinated.
**Blake.schneider**: Who needs to be made aware and when, what time period, time frame.
**Blake.schneider**: We can kind of get that done in, like, time of day.
**Blake.schneider**: It needs to be completed.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Blake.schneider**: But that's all I got.
**Ataylor**: Alrighty.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, I know the framers are there today.
**Ataylor**: They're getting the vestibule done.
**Ataylor**: And the entrance wall where the windows are, they're gonna get that all framed up too, so should be looking pretty good.
**Blake.schneider**: Okay.
**Blake.schneider**: Yep.
**Blake.schneider**: That sounds great.
**Blake.schneider**: That sounds great.
