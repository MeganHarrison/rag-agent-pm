## Transcript
**Sclevenger**: Hey, Sean, Good morning.
**Sclevenger**: How are you guys?
**Cmortensen**: Oh, I'm doing well.
**Cmortensen**: How about yourself?
**Sclevenger**: Doing fine.
**Sclevenger**: Doing fine.
**Cmortensen**: Hey.
**Cmortensen**: AJ is on the way to the hospital with his wife.
**Cmortensen**: He's not going to be able to make the call.
**Sclevenger**: Okay.
**Cmortensen**: He just called me to let me know that.
**Cmortensen**: And we're still waiting on the permit.
**Cmortensen**: Obviously, we got the commons back and responded to them, so now the ball's back in their court, so waiting on that.
**Cmortensen**: But as soon as we get that permit, I mean, we have everything ready to rock and roll.
**Cmortensen**: We have equipment ordered.
**Cmortensen**: I mean, I got the seal on site already ready to be put up.
**Cmortensen**: My door cutter, he's ready to go.
**Cmortensen**: H Vac is good to go.
**Cmortensen**: Like, everybody's ready to rock and roll as soon as we get this.
**Sclevenger**: Okay.
**Sclevenger**: All right, sounds good.
**Cmortensen**: As much as possible.
**Cmortensen**: But City of Carmel is taking their sweet time.
**Sclevenger**: Yeah.
**Sclevenger**: Yeah, unfortunately.
**Cmortensen**: Yeah.
**Cmortensen**: It's actually pretty crazy how long they're taking.
**Sclevenger**: So it's.
**Sclevenger**: It's a.
**Sclevenger**: It's, you know, and it's unfortunate that they have that kind of respect, but.
**Sclevenger**: Or disrespect for us.
**Cmortensen**: Yeah, Yeah.
**Cmortensen**: I mean, it's.
**Sclevenger**: Oh, anyway.
**Cmortensen**: I mean, come on now.
**Sclevenger**: So, anyway.
**Sclevenger**: Yeah, okay.
**Cmortensen**: But that's where we're at with things.
**Sclevenger**: Okay.
**Sclevenger**: All right.
**Sclevenger**: Do you need then anything else from me or.
**Cmortensen**: Not that I'm aware of.
**Cmortensen**: Sure.
**Cmortensen**: If we do, we'll get a hold of you.
**Sclevenger**: Okay.
**Sclevenger**: Okay.
**Cmortensen**: How about you?
**Cmortensen**: Do you need anything from us?
**Sclevenger**: I don't think so.
**Sclevenger**: I think.
**Sclevenger**: Yeah, I think we're, you know, obviously same boat.
**Sclevenger**: You are just sitting there and waiting.
**Sclevenger**: I'm not familiar with any other questions that we have on our end.
**Sclevenger**: Glendon is going to be taking over Corey's role for this project anyway and.
**Cmortensen**: Let AJ know that.
**Sclevenger**: Okay.
**Cmortensen**: And.
**Sclevenger**: He unfortunately wasn't able to attend today again.
**Sclevenger**: Rich has got him pretty busy these days, but he probably will moving forward.
**Cmortensen**: Okay, I'll update him on that.
**Cmortensen**: And if there's anything you are needing.
**Sclevenger**: Yeah, well, yeah, we're going to be relying pretty heavy on you guys, so.
**Sclevenger**: I appreciate that.
**Sclevenger**: But, gosh, any questions at all or concerns, just reach out to us and we'll see what we can do.
**Cmortensen**: We will.
**Sclevenger**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I don't think.
**Bclymer**: Sorry, I missed the first part of it.
**Bclymer**: AJ's headed to the hospital, so he couldn't join.
**Bclymer**: I'd seen the email about the permit comments, so we'll dive into that, you know, as soon as we get whatever we got to do to get that through.
**Bclymer**: I know AJ is more up to speed on the responses to all those, so.
**Sclevenger**: Okay.
**Sclevenger**: Okay.
**Cmortensen**: Yep.
**Sclevenger**: Sounds good, then.
**Bclymer**: Appreciate it.
**Sclevenger**: Thank you.
**Sclevenger**: Thank you, guys.
**Cmortensen**: Have a great weekend.
**Sclevenger**: You, too.
**Sclevenger**: Bye.
**Cmortensen**: All right, bye.
