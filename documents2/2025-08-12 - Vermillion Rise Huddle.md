## Transcript
**Awehner**: ataylor.
**Bclymer**: Coming to this?
**Awehner**: I thought it was just me.
**Awehner**: Jesse then or me and AJ Then maybe you and Jesse and double check.
**Awehner**: I can try giving AJ a call if you want.
**Awehner**: Yeah, sure.
**Jdawson**: Are you on camera?
**Awehner**: S.A.
**Jdawson**: Sorry.
**Awehner**: Good.
**Awehner**: A.J.
**Awehner**: how's it going, man?
**Jdawson**: What's going on, Alex?
**Awehner**: Okay, so what did you just want to use like a touch base meeting and go over the project?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, so let me.
**Jdawson**: Probably still 20 minutes away from the office, so maybe 15, but did you have a chance to watch the video?
**Jdawson**: I know Jesse Dawson's working on drawings.
**Jdawson**: I thought he'd be joining this.
**Jdawson**: Is he in the office?
**Jdawson**: Brendan?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, he's talking.
**Bclymer**: I mean, it doesn't really matter.
**Bclymer**: You gotta be the office in 20 minutes anyway.
**Jdawson**: Well, what do you.
**Jdawson**: I'm here to talk and help talk through it.
**Jdawson**: So, Alec, what we need is did you do a.
**Jdawson**: Have you created a new estimate yet based off of mine?
**Awehner**: I saw that you had a design estimate built.
**Awehner**: I created a new template sheet and it started going based on the one drawing I received this morning from Brandon and Jesse.
**Awehner**: Just kind of calling out some things I can immediately see and trying to dig in the best I can.
**Awehner**: I already spoke.
**Awehner**: Oh, good.
**Jdawson**: So the easiest thing to always do is I already created a budget.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Did you see that original estimate in there?
**Awehner**: I thought that was just for design.
**Awehner**: So I can.
**Awehner**: I can use that if you want, but.
**Jdawson**: So there's two estimates in there.
**Jdawson**: If you look in the file folder.
**Bclymer**: It says Familiarize Edition budget.
**Bclymer**: Familiarize Edition design.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Jdawson**: So what we.
**Jdawson**: So what you need to do is.
**Jdawson**: You need to look at that.
**Jdawson**: Open up that Vermillion Rise edition budget.
**Awehner**: Got it.
**Jdawson**: You pull that up.
**Jdawson**: Why don't you share your screen?
**Awehner**: Yep, got it.
**Awehner**: Here.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so.
**Jdawson**: So do a.
**Jdawson**: Do a file, save as Gotcha and title it.
**Bclymer**: I just want to look at it.
**Awehner**: Oh, okay.
**Awehner**: One second here.
**Awehner**: I'll go back.
**Jdawson**: You click on.
**Jdawson**: We just don't want to change that.
**Jdawson**: So if you.
**Jdawson**: If you do a save as Alec and save it in the OneDrive.
**Jdawson**: So you just click on OneDrive, you're at the page and save it as Vermillion Rise addition and just do it.
**Jdawson**: Estimate with today's date.
**Jdawson**: We know that that is the most current one we're operating out of.
**Awehner**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Awehner**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: You go to that.
**Jdawson**: That detail sheet.
**Jdawson**: You'll find like I was pretty specific on.
**Jdawson**: On my labels I have in there.
**Awehner**: Sure.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: So go to the.
**Jdawson**: You can see like, okay, this number is for X, this number is for Y.
**Jdawson**: And then you can get an idea of what we plugged for the scope.
**Jdawson**: And then we need to get three estimates on each one.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: For each division.
**Awehner**: That.
**Bclymer**: That doesn't mean call three people and they say, I'm going to bid it.
**Bclymer**: Because you call 10 people, seven will say they bid it.
**Bclymer**: You get two numbers.
**Awehner**: Okay?
**Bclymer**: You're never gonna get.
**Bclymer**: You're never gonna get in trouble for having eight numbers on a job.
**Bclymer**: I'm never gonna yell at you for that.
**Bclymer**: Now, if you have one number, I will.
**Awehner**: Yeah.
**Awehner**: Okay, so you've already gone through the entire estimate, so this is what I need to be going off of.
**Awehner**: Or should I be adding to this as well?
**Awehner**: Just.
**Jdawson**: Well, you're gonna define more scope, right?
**Jdawson**: If you.
**Jdawson**: Did you have a chance to watch their meeting?
**Awehner**: No.
**Awehner**: Jesse mentioned to me that he was gonna send me the meeting minutes.
**Awehner**: I'll go in there and remind him here in a moment.
**Jdawson**: Watch that meeting and that'll give you an idea.
**Jdawson**: But this gives you a general.
**Jdawson**: I mean, scope.
**Jdawson**: And so what you do is you can do a save as on this.
**Jdawson**: So we're operating out of the right one.
**Jdawson**: Then you do a save as of the word document clarifications I have in there.
**Jdawson**: Alec.
**Jdawson**: So wait.
**Jdawson**: Go.
**Jdawson**: All right, you got it.
**Jdawson**: Never mind.
**Jdawson**: I'm sorry.
**Jdawson**: Thought you clicked on the wrong.
**Jdawson**: Wrong thing.
**Awehner**: Today's date.
**Awehner**: Got it.
**Jdawson**: Was it in the right folder?
**Jdawson**: I make that mistake all the time.
**Awehner**: No, it's in the right one.
**Awehner**: I got right here.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: And so it's really.
**Jdawson**: Alec, it's really easy how we do estimates, right?
**Jdawson**: What you can do is you can compare.
**Bclymer**: I did.
**Jdawson**: You can compare what I have in our estimate.
**Jdawson**: Right, that budget one.
**Jdawson**: So now you're operating on a new one.
**Jdawson**: If you compare that with our clarifications, it spells out what we have included.
**Jdawson**: Exactly.
**Jdawson**: So what you need to price out is what we have included in that clarification because that's what we sent to the owner.
**Awehner**: Okay, so this was a fig.
**Awehner**: Okay, that's.
**Awehner**: Yeah.
**Awehner**: I just want to make sure I was on the right page of, like, knowing.
**Awehner**: Is this still a work in progress?
**Awehner**: We need to button up some of these numbers to figure out exactly what the scope is.
**Awehner**: Or if we're like, this is our solid thing now we're just verifying it.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: So we define the scope right to our guys.
**Jdawson**: And if you look at that clarifications, you'll know.
**Jdawson**: You'll have a general idea of what I included.
**Jdawson**: So I get.
**Jdawson**: We gave the client a budget based off a design build.
**Jdawson**: And we said, here's what we think it's going to be.
**Jdawson**: And now we actually have to go and get firm, you know, firm pricing based off of a design build scope.
**Jdawson**: So Jesse's marking up drawings that you can put on Plan Hub and then you can send out.
**Awehner**: Perfect.
**Awehner**: Okay.
**Awehner**: Yeah.
**Awehner**: I already started digging into or thinking about my old contacts in India.
**Awehner**: I've used when I built a warehouse in Plainfield a few years back.
**Awehner**: I just spoke with my structural steel guy.
**Awehner**: That's actually their manufacturing facilities in Terre Haute.
**Awehner**: So the shipping cost would be pretty cheap.
**Awehner**: Thankfully I spoke to him over lunch and as soon as I have drawings, he said that he will happily take a look at them.
**Awehner**: So.
**Awehner**: And then I'm doing the same thing.
**Awehner**: Yeah, I'm doing the same thing already.
**Awehner**: I looked up what precast panel supplier I use on that job too.
**Awehner**: I just got to remember the contact, but I'm trying to get that ball rolling.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: So precast is critical, Brandon, what else are you thinking?
**Jdawson**: We need concrete.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Is Brandon there?
**Bclymer**: Sorry, I'm sitting here talking to Jesse about something else, but what'd you ask about concrete?
**Jdawson**: What?
**Jdawson**: Well, I was just telling Alec like what's critical is obviously he's already looking for a pre cast guy.
**Jdawson**: Now what I would do, Alec, is look at the original drawings we have in there and see who did the precast originally.
**Bclymer**: That won't show the, the original drawings won't show who did the precast.
**Bclymer**: That, that's just a general.
**Bclymer**: You'd have to have shop drawings.
**Bclymer**: But you're going to call.
**Bclymer**: I mean it's going to be county material.
**Bclymer**: Atmi, like there's only a few of them.
**Awehner**: Yeah, atmi is the one that I was looking into right now.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: Atmi and accounting material is the other one.
**Bclymer**: You need to get prices for both those guys.
**Awehner**: True.
**Jdawson**: And then we need.
**Jdawson**: No, any site work in concrete is pretty, pretty specific.
**Jdawson**: So I don't know.
**Jdawson**: Jesse Dawson, how much do you have done on the, on the markup drawings?
**Awehner**: I saved them in the folder.
**Awehner**: Now I had them in while they.
**Jdawson**: Were in the existing drawing folder, but.
**Awehner**: Now they're just out in the main drawing folder.
**Jdawson**: So I got the site plan pretty much done.
**Awehner**: I'm started on the architectural, so I'm working through them.
**Jdawson**: So I'll get it done today.
**Awehner**: We'll be ready to post them tomorrow.
**Awehner**: Gotcha.
**Awehner**: I think I still got some, I think I still got some buddies at Wilhelm Concrete as well.
**Awehner**: They, they're the big, the big concrete.
**Awehner**: Don't Use them.
**Jdawson**: Don't use them.
**Jdawson**: No, they're a competitor, they're a general contractor.
**Jdawson**: There's enough.
**Bclymer**: This is not a Wilhelm.
**Bclymer**: Concrete is good for doing advanced concrete.
**Bclymer**: Like this is an 8 inch unreinforced slab.
**Bclymer**: Like call MNC, call merit, call half a dozen others.
**Bclymer**: Like there's a zillion.
**Bclymer**: All you need is a damn laser screeter and you can do it.
**Bclymer**: You really didn't think any reinforcement?
**Awehner**: Okay, got it.
**Jdawson**: I mean, Brandon, you never like to give jobs to another gc, right?
**Bclymer**: No, it's our competition.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah.
**Awehner**: No, it's totally fair.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, it's the same reason I don't use rsq.
**Jdawson**: Right?
**Jdawson**: Exactly.
**Jdawson**: Alec, I would, I would go look at, at Collective, Right.
**Jdawson**: You can go into bid responses and see who we got pricing from for concrete etc.
**Jdawson**: Now don't do the steel there because those guys are pre engineered metal building guys.
**Jdawson**: But that's a good start.
**Bclymer**: No, he said.
**Jdawson**: Right Brandon, because.
**Jdawson**: And Jesse, because those are.
**Jdawson**: I mean that was a local job.
**Jdawson**: I know Terre Haute's kind of out there, but big enough job.
**Jdawson**: Guys will travel two hours away.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, we already created the Plan Hub.
**Awehner**: Because it's going to find all these.
**Jdawson**: Local subs for us.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, exactly.
**Bclymer**: There's, there's each other.
**Bclymer**: You'll pull a concrete guy out of Terre Haute.
**Bclymer**: Like there'll be right next door.
**Jdawson**: I'm just, I.
**Jdawson**: Plan Hub sends it out to like 30, 000 people sometimes.
**Jdawson**: So it's like you can be specific.
**Jdawson**: Why wouldn't we?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I mean you, you can just figure out a way to narrow it to only, you know, within so many miles of the site or some.
**Jdawson**: Alec, you have to make sure before you send an invite to people on Plan Hub, click on them and do two minutes of research and make sure they're not a general contractor or make sure they're actually specific to that trade.
**Jdawson**: Because I, I've used Plan Hub before and you can make that mistake really easily.
**Jdawson**: Same thing with building Connected.
**Awehner**: Understood.
**Jdawson**: Don't just like, don't just send it out in a 30 mile radius because it's going to go to other general contractors.
**Awehner**: Sure.
**Awehner**: Yeah.
**Awehner**: Understood.
**Awehner**: Gotcha.
**Awehner**: Okay.
**Awehner**: Yeah, that's definitely enough to go off for now.
**Awehner**: I think I'll pull those drawings that Jesse said he has in the folder and yeah, I'll just get to digging into local contractors and such.
**Awehner**: No problem.
**Bclymer**: Well, we need to aj I mean if you want to put him on something that's critical.
**Bclymer**: I mean design.
**Jdawson**: I, I granted.
**Jdawson**: I, I will have design today.
**Jdawson**: Okay?
**Jdawson**: I will have people guaranteed numbers today.
**Jdawson**: I've already been making calls to talk with Jerome.
**Jdawson**: I just can't get a hold of these HWC guys.
**Jdawson**: But I haven't really called them yet.
**Jdawson**: But I got time here after I'm done running into these jobs.
**Jdawson**: You talking to me?
**Bclymer**: Oh, I'm talking to my fucking self.
**Jdawson**: What did you say?
**Bclymer**: Well, I haven't called him.
**Bclymer**: Like.
**Jdawson**: I tried calling.
**Jdawson**: Dude, stop.
**Jdawson**: You know what I mean?
**Jdawson**: I tried calling Terre Haute twice now.
**Jdawson**: Okay?
**Jdawson**: I will try again.
**Jdawson**: That's all I'm saying.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, don't jump off a bridge.
**Jdawson**: All right, well, go give Brandon a hug.
**Jdawson**: Be all right.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Awehner**: I don't know if I know him that well yet.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, you don't.
**Awehner**: We'll get there.
**Awehner**: But, yeah, I'll keep you in the loop best I can.
**Awehner**: And I'll shoot you.
**Awehner**: Just teams, messages, giving you updates on where I'm at.
**Awehner**: I won't bother you too much.
**Awehner**: Know you're busy, but.
**Awehner**: But, yeah, no message received.
**Awehner**: You know, I'll definitely do the research before I send out bid invites and whatnot.
**Awehner**: I'm still getting a little used to plan how, but it seems pretty straightforward.
**Awehner**: And I can just do simple Google searches in the area as well, so.
**Jdawson**: All right, ma', am.
**Awehner**: Awesome.
**Awehner**: Talk soon, man.
**Awehner**: Thanks.
**Awehner**: You.
