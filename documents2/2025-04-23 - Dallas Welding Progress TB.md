## Transcript
**Deldred**: Morning, Gannon.
**Deldred**: Morning, sir.
**Deldred**: How you doing?
**Deldred**: Hey.
**Sglaze**: Good.
**Sglaze**: Hey, can you do me a favor and kill this.
**Sglaze**: Whatever the no thing you have going is.
**Deldred**: Get rid of it.
**Sglaze**: Yes, sir.
**Deldred**: Okay.
**Deldred**: Let me see if I can do that.
**Sglaze**: And let's not do that again, please.
**Deldred**: Okay.
**Deldred**: I'll be honest.
**Deldred**: I think that's something our company has built in.
**Deldred**: Anytime one of us jump in a chat.
**Sglaze**: Yeah.
**Sglaze**: We've done a lot of transcription and recording for external partners on Alta calls.
**Sglaze**: So I don't know if I need to start up a separate call or how you want to handle this.
**Deldred**: I think we may need to start a new call.
