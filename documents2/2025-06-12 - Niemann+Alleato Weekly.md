**Sclevenger**: Hey, guys.
**Sclevenger**: How's it going?
**Sclevenger**: Good.
**Cmortensen**: How are you?
**Bclymer**: Good.
**Cmortensen**: Corey.
**Sclevenger**: How are you?
**Bclymer**: Hanging in there.
**Bclymer**: Hanging in there by a thread, but I'm hanging in there.
**Sclevenger**: Oh, man.
**Sclevenger**: Let me know if there's anything that I can help you on.
**Sclevenger**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Well, how far you want to travel.
**Sclevenger**: Corey?
**Sclevenger**: You know we know, you know we travel, right?
**Bclymer**: Oh, yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Sclevenger**: So right now I'm, I'm looking at jobs in Phoenix and Florida, and I have one in Dallas and California, so.
**Bclymer**: Wow.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I knew you guys.
**Bclymer**: I didn't know how far, but.
**Sclevenger**: Yeah, so we, we have our Nascala, which, which gets us.
**Sclevenger**: We can pretty much get a license in any state we want.
**Sclevenger**: And we just, we add them to the list as projects come up and people need our helps and travel and so seriously, if there's anything I can help you with, just.
**Sclevenger**: Just let me know, okay?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Appreciate it.
**Sclevenger**: That being said, I, I wish I had a better update for you guys for this Carmel location.
**Sclevenger**: As far as the permit goes, I still don't have that amendment approval from, from city of Carmel.
**Sclevenger**: I've been following up daily, Corey.
**Sclevenger**: I am waiting on an updated signage packet from FedEx and I've been bumping them as well.
**Sclevenger**: They told me they're working on it, but at this point, I, I made a new schedule and, and I shared it with the, the, the FedEx PM was, was hitting me up, the JL guy, so I, I, I shared it with him.
**Sclevenger**: And I was going to go through it with you here, Corey.
**Sclevenger**: I mean, they're well aware right now the ball's kind of in like I'm waiting on FedEx for stuff.
**Sclevenger**: And so I, I pushed it back a little to give us just some, some time as far as start date.
**Sclevenger**: And I've already shared that with them.
**Sclevenger**: And so they're aware that they're holding us up.
**Sclevenger**: So let me pull this up.
**Sclevenger**: I'm not, I'm not worried about it yet.
**Sclevenger**: If, if I get this permit middle of next week, we'll be, we'll be good to go.
**Cmortensen**: Sure.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Sclevenger**: See here, that's what I'm looking for.
**Sclevenger**: Can you guys see that?
**Sclevenger**: Can.
**Bclymer**: I'm on my iPad, so I can blow it up.
**Sclevenger**: It's okay.
**Sclevenger**: I just, I'll email it to you.
**Sclevenger**: But I, I pushed this city of Carmel review back to not receiving it now, our permit, until Tuesday next week.
**Sclevenger**: And then that would give us, you know, next week to mobilize, get dumpsters on site.
**Sclevenger**: And then I changed this as well to include what that front entrance looks like.
**Sclevenger**: And I Still have our date on Tuesday the 2nd now.
**Sclevenger**: So not, not too out of, out of wonk from what we officially or originally had.
**Sclevenger**: But I've made it clear to FedEx, hey, I need this updated signage.
**Sclevenger**: And then, you know, we're at the mercy of the, of the city right now as far as when they give us this approval.
**Sclevenger**: The last I heard from was, was late last week and she said follow up with me at the beginning of the week.
**Sclevenger**: And I've followed up twice now and haven't heard anything.
**Sclevenger**: So I, I, I expect to have something here in the next couple days.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Sclevenger**: Other than that, we're all bought out.
**Sclevenger**: We're ready to go.
**Sclevenger**: The guys, we had our first sub, sub contractor meeting that Alex led yesterday morning and everybody's ripping and roaring, ready to get going.
**Sclevenger**: We, we may start on getting some material in there and potentially, you know, laying out for where that new RTU is going to go, you know, just some minor stuff.
**Sclevenger**: So as soon as we get that permit, we're comfortable with opening up the walls and, and doing our thing.
**Bclymer**: Probably not you guys, but we had a bunch of fire extinguishers and fire extinguisher cabinets in that space that showed up that nobody knows where they came from.
**Bclymer**: That wasn't you guys, was it?
**Sclevenger**: No, no.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: We sold our, our store to, to, to get them out so they wouldn't in the way.
**Bclymer**: But.
**Sclevenger**: Yeah, I don't know.
**Sclevenger**: I mean, I think that, Yeah, I just told him.
**Bclymer**: I know probably a long shot, but we'll, we'll keep them, we'll use them somewhere.
**Bclymer**: But I didn't want to make sure you guys hadn't ordered them for something and stuck them in there.
**Sclevenger**: Yeah, yeah, I'm not Alex.
**Cmortensen**: Yeah.
**Sclevenger**: I think we only have one fire extinguisher cabinet.
**Sclevenger**: I'm pretty sure that's in FedEx's scope, so.
**Sclevenger**: Okay, we wouldn't, have, we wouldn't have ordered a bunch of them.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Cmortensen**: Now there's, that palette has been there.
**Cmortensen**: There's like a dozen of them there.
**Cmortensen**: But.
**Cmortensen**: Okay.
**Cmortensen**: But yeah, I mean they're, they're what we would need for the one that we need.
**Sclevenger**: None of our guys would have ordered that many though, so.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Sclevenger**: Yeah, I, I don't think that was us.
**Sclevenger**: We'll swing by though, and just triple check.
**Ahuettl**: So.
**Sclevenger**: Yeah, that's that, that's the only, the update I have is no update as far as it goes.
**Bclymer**: I'm gonna, I'm gonna get this change order signed today.
**Bclymer**: And that first pay app that you sent me, so you should see that back today.
**Sclevenger**: Yeah, yeah, that's fine.
**Sclevenger**: I just.
**Sclevenger**: Just so we can log and I.
**Sclevenger**: I know it was a zero dollar change order, but.
**Cmortensen**: Right.
**Sclevenger**: It helps.
**Sclevenger**: It helps, you know, and it helps us be transparent with where money's moving.
**Sclevenger**: So.
**Bclymer**: No, I'll get it back to you here shortly.
**Sclevenger**: Perfect, sir.
**Sclevenger**: Did you guys ever.
**Bclymer**: You may.
**Bclymer**: You may have.
**Bclymer**: AJ did you guys ever send a W9?
**Sclevenger**: I thought we did, but if we didn't.
**Sclevenger**: Let me.
**Sclevenger**: Let me make a note here to follow up with the county to make sure they get it to you.
**Bclymer**: I think you did, too.
**Bclymer**: It's just been a while.
**Sclevenger**: Yeah.
**Sclevenger**: Yep.
**Sclevenger**: All right, Glendon, you got any questions?
**Bclymer**: Don't think so.
**Cmortensen**: I think I got all the information I need.
**Sclevenger**: Okay, well, like I said, I'll keep you guys updated and I'll stay on FedEx, so.
**Cmortensen**: All right.
**Sclevenger**: Yep.
**Sclevenger**: Talk to you later.
**Bclymer**: All right, we'll see you.
**Cmortensen**: Bye.
