## Transcript
**Aimee.despres**: Hi there.
**Aimee.despres**: How are you?
**Aimee.despres**: Hi, I'm good.
**Kara.childress**: How are you?
**Kara.childress**: Let me just make sure.
**Kara.childress**: Also, Brandon is connecting.
**Kara.childress**: Okay, one second, please.
**Jason.scaduto**: Yeah.
**Kara.childress**: Hi, Jensen.
**Kara.childress**: Thanks for asking for joining once again.
**Alex.campos**: Hi, how you doing, Maria?
**Aimee.despres**: Hi.
**Kara.childress**: Okay, well, there you go.
**Kara.childress**: There he is.
**Aimee.despres**: Hi there.
**Bclymer**: How's everybody doing?
**Aimee.despres**: Good.
**Aimee.despres**: We might have one more from Venture joining, but I wanted to thank you for putting this together.
**Aimee.despres**: It was actually on my list to reconnect with you this week.
**Aimee.despres**: Anyways.
**Aimee.despres**: Alex and Kara are traveling internationally this week, so they're not available to join.
**Aimee.despres**: So for now, though, for the purposes of the conversation, because I didn't want to lose momentum.
**Aimee.despres**: Jason, you've interacted with.
**Aimee.despres**: Possibly already met on a call, I'm not sure.
**Aimee.despres**: But you know, he's the regional vice president of Central, where your payroll falls.
**Aimee.despres**: He's on the payroll side of the house.
**Aimee.despres**: And Kirk is.
**Aimee.despres**: Works on my team.
**Aimee.despres**: He's the RVP of client relations for that Central area.
**Aimee.despres**: And then I invited my counterpart, the senior vice president of payroll, George Alonzo here as well.
**Aimee.despres**: And I thought maybe we could kind of have the discussion here from your team about where we stand and kind of take it from there.
**Bclymer**: What do we have to do to stop messing up payroll?
**Aimee.despres**: That is a fair question.
**Aimee.despres**: I don't know if Jason or George want to tap into that one first.
**Alex.campos**: Yeah, sure.
**Alex.campos**: So I guess, you know, obviously I'm not, you know, knee deep in your payroll all the time.
**Alex.campos**: What are your concerns up front?
**Alex.campos**: I guess, I mean, I know when they're supposed to and they're not getting paid on time.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So we had the same issue Friday.
**Bclymer**: We had Maria, what, two weeks ago, and then four weeks ago.
**Bclymer**: Like, it's literally, I think you guys have done four payrolls and gotten one.
**Bclymer**: Right?
**Kara.childress**: Yeah.
**Kara.childress**: The problem also, sorry, just to back up Brandon was saying is the problem is also there's always like a back and forth type of thing.
**Kara.childress**: So they're always asking, for example, one of our employees is like, hey, I I didn't receive my meal back.
**Kara.childress**: Or I didn't receive like this type of the payment that it was supposed to be done, or I already set up pto and so things like that.
**Kara.childress**: So usually like comments, back and forth, emails all the time.
**Kara.childress**: So it's kind of difficult for us also to keep track of who is the receiving, who is not.
**Kara.childress**: And then always a lot of employees are like, complaining about, I didn't get my payroll, I didn't get paid enough, or it is.
**Kara.childress**: And the payroll that I, you know, like, I set up on the platform.
**Kara.childress**: So that's the issues that are usually coming, you know, they're very recurring from our employees and it's very frustrating.
**Bclymer**: I mean, even besides the ancillarial changes, like, whatever, I mean, the base pay gets screwed up.
**Bclymer**: Now let's start with how do we fix that and stop messing that up.
**Alex.campos**: Okay.
**Alex.campos**: I mean, bear with me one second.
**Bclymer**: And how about an explanation on what happened with Friday's payroll?
**Bclymer**: Why did all these guys get 100 deduction of their HSA randomly?
**Alex.campos**: So my understanding of that, and again, I'm relaying what's told to me, but my understanding of that is our HSA team entered a front loaded amount for the HSAs.
**Alex.campos**: I think portion, a portion of it was a catch up amount.
**Alex.campos**: Am I correct in saying that?
**Alex.campos**: Because there was not amounts taken in the previous weeks.
**Bclymer**: You're asking me?
**Alex.campos**: Oh, I mean, so you're telling me.
**Bclymer**: That, that, that we directed your HSA team to take out 100% of this?
**Alex.campos**: I, I'm not saying that you told us to take out 100%.
**Alex.campos**: My understanding, again, I'm relaying all the information that Angela Thompson is coming to meet with is that there was HSAs that were missed for previous weeks.
**Bclymer**: Why were these.
**Alex.campos**: I don't know.
**Alex.campos**: I could get you that answer though.
**Alex.campos**: Most certainly.
**Alex.campos**: Brandon, let me.
**Alex.campos**: Oh, good.
**Bclymer**: Sorry.
**Jdawson**: Jason, let me step in here a second.
**Jdawson**: I want to make sure that.
**Jdawson**: And nice to meet you guys.
**Jdawson**: I appreciate you taking the time to explain to us in detail some of the things and challenges that you have.
**Jdawson**: I apologize up front for, for you guys experiencing this.
**Jdawson**: But I want to make sure that.
**Jdawson**: I just want to say the HSA team operates outside of the payroll team.
**Jdawson**: So when Jason says, you know, we're being told that you weren't deducted, sometimes we're not fully aware of the things that maybe HSA team has talked to you guys directly if that has occurred.
**Alex.campos**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Could you imagine if I was building your guys new office and I said, you know, hey, we put a toilet in the middle of the office there and like, why is it like, well, I don't know, that's.
**Bclymer**: You got to ask the superintendent, you know, Right?
**Bclymer**: Like, oh, you gotta ask that guy.
**Bclymer**: And you're like, I don't give a.
**Bclymer**: I pay a lido.
**Jdawson**: Agreed?
**Alex.campos**: Yeah, absolutely.
**Jdawson**: And that's, that's on us.
**Jdawson**: That's on us that we're gonna discover why that happened.
**Jdawson**: I think Jason was more saying as like, hey, have you got.
**Jdawson**: Are you guys aware of this kind of deal?
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: We'll.
**Jdawson**: We'll circle back to that.
**Jdawson**: But I'm more concerned about when you say you have four payrolls that employees have not gotten paid on time.
**Jdawson**: We're not talking about the entire payroll.
**Jdawson**: We're talking about some individuals that haven't received particular pay.
**Bclymer**: The first one, the HCA didn't get processed.
**Bclymer**: So I was in Canada, and I had to figure out a wire that day because that morning, nothing got hit.
**Bclymer**: And then I had to get a wire out that day.
**Bclymer**: I guess that VP must have got fired because I don't see him on this email or on this meeting and then the next pay.
**Bclymer**: And then I said, guys, I told you to get this HCA out.
**Bclymer**: I said, pre.
**Bclymer**: Pull my HCA this week so that this doesn't happen again.
**Bclymer**: Fast forward to the next payroll after I keep emailing, hey, why isn't this.
**Bclymer**: What's going on here?
**Bclymer**: Why isn't this pulled yet?
**Bclymer**: Why isn't this pooled yet?
**Bclymer**: Lo and behold, doesn't happen again.
**Bclymer**: I got to do another wire, you know, the same day.
**Bclymer**: So even though, like, guys should be getting their checks that morning, I'm scrambling to get these wires out that same day so that you guys process payroll.
**Bclymer**: So my guys get paid.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: And then fast forward to the next one.
**Bclymer**: Then we got one, right?
**Bclymer**: Except one of our guys, a vp, for some reason, his bank account information was changed, which your previous VP said he did it.
**Bclymer**: Like, I don't know why, or he didn't have a good explanation, but he randomly changed somebody's bank account information.
**Bclymer**: And then fast forward to the next payroll.
**Bclymer**: We have this issue where 100% of HSAs are taken out and for no apparent reason.
**Jdawson**: Okay, that's on us.
**Jdawson**: We'll get with the hsa.
**Jdawson**: I'm sorry, HSA team to find out exactly why that got changed.
**Alex.campos**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Obviously, that should have been communicated with you guys way ahead of time if that was the case.
**Jdawson**: But it doesn't sound like it was done intentionally, but I'll get to the bottom of that.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Alex.campos**: Oh, I'm sorry.
**Alex.campos**: Go ahead.
**Alex.campos**: I just want to set kind of what I thought this meeting was going to be.
**Alex.campos**: I just want to gather all the information so that I could get you these answers.
**Alex.campos**: You know, as you mentioned, I know it's probably very frustrating to have to do this step and then another step.
**Alex.campos**: Right.
**Alex.campos**: But obviously, Angela Thompson, who's running your payroll, I don't know if the VP you were referencing, if his name was Ed.
**Alex.campos**: Does that sound ring any bells in your world?
**Bclymer**: We don't have any Numbers in our company.
**Alex.campos**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: On our side.
**Jdawson**: Not in your company.
**Jdawson**: On our side.
**Bclymer**: Oh no, your guys name was like sort of the I something like er.
**Alex.campos**: Yeah, it's EJ I Dash.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Kara.childress**: Yes, that's the one.
**Alex.campos**: He is part of my team.
**Alex.campos**: So what I want to do is just gather all the information up front and then I'm going to go back to my team and be like, what the heck's going on?
**Alex.campos**: Right.
**Alex.campos**: Like so then I could give you active answers and fix this for the future, you know, and I apologize, apologize in advance for not having the answers for you today.
**Alex.campos**: But I certainly will get them within the next couple of days and provide you what I believe will be adequate answers and solutions that this doesn't continue to happen.
**Aimee.despres**: Well, if I could piggyback off of that.
**Aimee.despres**: So one of the reasons I asked Kirk to join and one of the things I wanted to speak to with you is, you know, Brandon, I appreciate your candor.
**Aimee.despres**: First of all, the fact that you're just laying it out there for us and I, I completely understand where you're coming from.
**Aimee.despres**: You know, I.
**Aimee.despres**: Not that's relevant per se to the conversation, but prior to my time working here at Venture, I actually used to be a client.
**Aimee.despres**: So what you're saying really resonates with me because if I have had a payroll issue, there are a lot of people that they're not coming to Venture to vent their frustrations.
**Aimee.despres**: They're coming to you and your team.
**Aimee.despres**: And in addition to that, this, this could be, you know, impactful to their ability to pay their bills or other things that they're trying to do.
**Aimee.despres**: And so I want to, I think we all recognize that, that we need to get this right.
**Aimee.despres**: But when it comes to the elements that sort of impact payroll, and Jason and George are right, sometimes it looks like it's pay because that's, you know, where the rubber meets the road, so to speak.
**Aimee.despres**: But there's other elements there.
**Aimee.despres**: That's where Kirk and I and our team come in.
**Aimee.despres**: Now that we're alerted to an issue, the client relations team's job is to keep, you know, attention on some of these items that cross different departments.
**Aimee.despres**: And so now that we're aware that there's an issue here, we're going to go ahead and work with Brianna and Dawn that are over here on our side and make sure that we are supporting the payroll team and making sure that not only do we get to the bottom of what happened, but that we put steps in place for it not to happen again.
**Aimee.despres**: So if it's an HSA item and that we have to work with benefits.
**Aimee.despres**: Usually we act as that go between or that team that helps make sure that everybody has the elements in place.
**Aimee.despres**: And we put a couple checks and a couple QC checks in place to make sure before it gets to payroll that those things are being done correctly.
**Aimee.despres**: So that's another reason I wanted Kirk to join us as well, to make sure that we can go back and come to you with some solutions, not just apologies.
**Aimee.despres**: Because obviously we could apologize for what happened, but you're looking for reassurance that this is back on track and not going to happen again.
**Aimee.despres**: Yeah, I mean, that's where we come in.
**Bclymer**: I appreciate you saying that.
**Bclymer**: And, and that's great, like understanding how you guys work.
**Bclymer**: My biggest thing is I shouldn't be in this meeting.
**Bclymer**: I shouldn't be dealing with this.
**Bclymer**: Like, what am I paying for?
**Bclymer**: Like, if, if I didn't pay you guys, you wouldn't just say, oh, sorry, like, we'll get it later, no big deal, like, you just wouldn't do it.
**Bclymer**: And so, like, I get it, it's somebody else's fault.
**Bclymer**: They're not on this call, whatever.
**Bclymer**: Like, my point is, like, this can't happen again.
**Bclymer**: And so that's why I was like told Maria said, get the CEO, get the coo.
**Bclymer**: Because at the end of the day, just like your company and my company, the buck stops here.
**Bclymer**: And so, you know, he can't say like, oh, well, it's not my fault, it's somebody else's.
**Bclymer**: Like, no, it's his company.
**Bclymer**: He'll figure it out and he'll make it stop.
**Bclymer**: Just like when somebody up with my company, I'll go in there and say, I will make this right.
**Alex.campos**: Owns their department.
**Alex.campos**: Right.
**Alex.campos**: I mean, both Amy and George, obviously, you know, Kirk and I report up to them.
**Alex.campos**: You know, I see what you're saying with obviously the CEO and you know, it's his company.
**Alex.campos**: Right.
**Alex.campos**: And if he wants to be successful, he's going to continue to do things that make him successful.
**Alex.campos**: Right.
**Alex.campos**: But I don't want a little bit.
**Kara.childress**: Sad that it's a little bit sad that he declined the meeting because I did invited him, but he declined it.
**Kara.childress**: And I was like, okay, that's a shame.
**Bclymer**: Well, the guys travel.
**Aimee.despres**: I will tell you, I had a.
**Bclymer**: Mad at him for that.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I travel all the time.
**Bclymer**: So I get that, like the biggest thing is like, whoever it is, whatever the powers to be are like, you know, we just need to get this fixed.
**Bclymer**: So if you guys got to go back and have a powwow between VP heads and be like, hey, you know, let's.
**Bclymer**: Let's figure out how to not this up again.
**Bclymer**: That's all we need to happen.
**Jdawson**: And I can assure you that that's going to happen.
**Jdawson**: You have the powers here on the call that are going to make that happen.
**Jdawson**: I mean, you know how it is.
**Jdawson**: You got to trust your team, right, Brandon, to execute on, on when we have a screw up.
**Jdawson**: We have enough people here on this call that we're gonna fix this problem for you as soon as possible.
**Jdawson**: Okay?
**Bclymer**: Okay, perfect.
**Bclymer**: So then, Maria, what else do we have?
**Bclymer**: Is there?
**Bclymer**: I know.
**Bclymer**: I guess probably the next thing moving forward would be.
**Bclymer**: So obviously you guys go and get that figured up.
**Bclymer**: And then Maria, if there's any other discrepancies or anything that's not right with payroll or that needs to get corrected, let's make sure we get that addressed and added on so that this next payroll, all that's taken care of.
**Bclymer**: And if there has to be some kind of check or balance or whatever process other than us going in and approving payroll, because we went and approved it on whatever Thursday or Wednesday, that was what we approved isn't what came to the bank accounts.
**Bclymer**: And so something's disconnected on your end because I mean, we can only approve what we see.
**Bclymer**: And so if there's got to be something else because, I mean, we can't know that you're saying, go ahead, Maria, go ahead.
**Kara.childress**: No, yeah.
**Kara.childress**: What I was saying is usually we always check the reports on payroll and always to double check.
**Kara.childress**: I ask Angela, Angela, is this what they're getting just to make sure?
**Kara.childress**: And she said, yeah, this, this is what they're getting, which is okay.
**Kara.childress**: And then the next day we just get in like, hey, I just received a balance of $27.
**Kara.childress**: And that's like, what do you mean $27?
**Kara.childress**: Like that's wasn't.
**Kara.childress**: That wasn't part of the reports.
**Kara.childress**: And then the other person is like, why do I have like, you know, all this amount going to.
**Kara.childress**: Etc.
**Kara.childress**: So there's a lot of discrepancies happening right now.
**Kara.childress**: And I think what we have now to move on with this also, because it's important to move on with this part and have it right.
**Kara.childress**: I think I have a meeting with you, Jason, and with answer and with Angela tomorrow, Tuesday or Wednesday, to go through all the things that are missing from payroll instead of also, for example, like the meal allowances and all this stuff.
**Kara.childress**: So we're going to go through that and make sure that everything is correct so this is not happening again.
**Kara.childress**: And we don't have employees freaking out of, you know, for their payments and then contacting Brandon, contacting me and everybody just what happened.
**Kara.childress**: So that's the next step.
**Alex.campos**: Quite frankly, I thought that was the meeting that I was walking into today, so I'm 100% open to that.
**Alex.campos**: I really want to make sure that we're not missing anything in terms of, like, mail allowances or anything like that.
**Alex.campos**: So let's just get together on another call, make sure that anything that needs to get paid out, right, we are receiving.
**Alex.campos**: We are paying it out accurately, and we'll.
**Alex.campos**: We'll install those checks and balances that Brandon had mentioned and make sure that, you know, again, you guys don't have to worry about this going forward.
**Bclymer**: And if that.
**Bclymer**: If you expected to have that meeting today, by all means, I'll jump off and you guys have the meeting and then.
**Bclymer**: Yes, George, to comment on your question, you were going to ask.
**Bclymer**: Yes, the.
**Bclymer**: The payroll that we approved did not show 100% of HSA going out.
**Bclymer**: The net amount was showing it again.
**Bclymer**: Unless somehow there was miscommunication.
**Aimee.despres**: And what.
**Bclymer**: We're reading it.
**Bclymer**: We read it wrong.
**Bclymer**: And Angie or whoever said yes, but that's, again, that's where the disconnect was, because the first thing I said was, I thought we just reviewed this.
**Alex.campos**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: The reason I ask is that's very concerning to me, that I'll dig into it on our end to see what changed between the time you approved it and the time we finalized it.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Anything in between there you guys need to be aware of.
**Jdawson**: And it should be going back to you for a secondary look and approval.
**Alex.campos**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Once you give us your green light, we should not be touching that payroll for anything unless we ask or request your approval again.
**Jdawson**: So that's something that we'll dig into on our side and see what occurred.
**Bclymer**: Cool.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: Any other questions for me?
**Aimee.despres**: Yeah, how about we do this?
**Aimee.despres**: Like, we'll do a little internal due diligence.
**Aimee.despres**: Payroll team will reconnect, it sounds like, with Maria and the client relations team as well, just to make sure we're aligned on what should be happening, and then we'll all come back after.
**Aimee.despres**: And all of this I expect to happen in the next day or so.
**Aimee.despres**: We'll come back and give you an update on where we stand with everything.
**Aimee.despres**: And then I had a final question, though.
**Aimee.despres**: Are there regular cadence calls set up for you at least?
**Aimee.despres**: Maria, with your client relations account manager, do you have like a monthly or weekly or bi weekly call scheduled with them.
**Aimee.despres**: Okay, so it sounds like we need to get that in place too.
**Aimee.despres**: Just, just at least for a while.
**Aimee.despres**: Have a little bit regular call and check in just to make sure this stays in the direction we need it to go in.
**Kara.childress**: One thing, one thing that I will suggest just for you also for everybody.
**Kara.childress**: You know, sometimes, you know, like there's a big platform and there's no, a lot of, how do you say, the, like onboarding on that.
**Kara.childress**: And it's payroll and it's important.
**Kara.childress**: So sometimes it's just like go and approve it and we're just going to go and approve it.
**Kara.childress**: Sometimes we're not actually full aware of the capabilities of the, or the time platform, you know, so for example, if I call Angela, she sometimes speak up and then she explained me things and blah, blah.
**Kara.childress**: But then if, if I don't call her to explain me, there are certain things, there's nobody there, you know, that teach me before on how to go to the platform and make sure everything is right.
**Kara.childress**: So I think also a lack of a step of onboarding or kind of like introduction to, hey, this platform.
**Kara.childress**: Let's have a one hour to go to payroll.
**Kara.childress**: Exactly.
**Kara.childress**: And then one hour, I don't know, to go to pto.
**Kara.childress**: So things like that that can help also make sure that on your side and on our side we're doing the right things and we don't have these type of problems.
**Kara.childress**: But yeah, so, so let's get, let's.
**Aimee.despres**: Get an overview scheduled, a little training that sounds like it's a gap on our side on the client relations side that we need to give you a little reintroduction into like the things that would help sort of avoid some of this on your side too, so that you can tell if something's going wrong, like where that might be happening.
**Aimee.despres**: So, Kirk, if it's okay, I'm going to have you work with the team, maybe have somebody go over.
**Aimee.despres**: It sounds like payroll will be our first course of events, but maybe just an overview on sort of the key areas too, just so that Maria has a good sense of where everything should be.
**Aimee.despres**: And then we can kind of.
**Aimee.despres**: We also have the support links we could share with her for more specific things if something pops up and we can coordinate on that.
**Aimee.despres**: But I think the team should be able to do that for you as well.
**Jason.scaduto**: I agree.
**Jason.scaduto**: And Jason, if you are going to have that call scheduled with Angela and meet with Ria, include our team so that we can.
**Jason.scaduto**: Even if it's a fly on the wall so that we can understand where the pain points are, because we can absolutely support, like, the training troubleshooting.
**Jason.scaduto**: Marie, if you need to reach out to us and say, hey, I just don't understand this.
**Jason.scaduto**: Can somebody walk me through?
**Jason.scaduto**: We can help you navigate those things for sure.
**Alex.campos**: Right?
**Alex.campos**: Absolutely.
**Alex.campos**: Yeah.
**Alex.campos**: I see.
**Alex.campos**: Do we know who's the sign to this on your team?
**Kara.childress**: I think that we have.
**Kara.childress**: Tomorrow I'm meeting with you, Jason.
**Kara.childress**: I think I set it up with you and Angela, Just you, me, Angela and the accounting team, because they want to go through the timesheets as well on Venture.
**Alex.campos**: Yes, I see that.
**Alex.campos**: Tomorrow at 10 Eastern.
**Kara.childress**: Correct.
**Aimee.despres**: So, great.
**Aimee.despres**: So let's maybe forward that to Kirk and he can kind of get the right people on.
**Alex.campos**: Yeah, it's going right now.
**Aimee.despres**: Awesome.
**Jason.scaduto**: Thank you.
**Aimee.despres**: And then, Brandon, sorry to meet under these circumstances.
**Aimee.despres**: And I hope that the next time that we all meet, it's for, you know, a positive, like, hey, we're growing in a bunch of states, and we want your support on building this out type conversation rather than on operations.
**Aimee.despres**: But I feel very confident with the.
**Aimee.despres**: The team we have on here from Venture that you won't see some of the things that you're seeing from this point forward.
**Aimee.despres**: And we're just going to keep it in, you know, moving in that direction.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I appreciate it, and I know that I am direct and a dick, but when it comes to my employees, there's nothing more that will grind my gears.
**Aimee.despres**: I.
**Aimee.despres**: I totally get it.
**Aimee.despres**: I was joking with.
**Aimee.despres**: I think it was you, Kirk, that I'm from the Northeast and we.
**Aimee.despres**: We have a direct nature.
**Aimee.despres**: So I'd rather know fully how you're feeling and what the impact is to your business so that we understand, you know, we do understand how serious it is, even if you weren't as direct.
**Aimee.despres**: But it really does help us get into your frame of mind that you're putting it right out there.
**Aimee.despres**: And I think it's a fair call out.
**Bclymer**: Awesome.
**Bclymer**: Thanks, everybody.
**Bclymer**: Appreciate your time.
**Aimee.despres**: All right, we'll see you soon.
**Jdawson**: Thank you, everybody.
**Jason.scaduto**: Thank you.
**Kara.childress**: Bye, guys.
**Kara.childress**: Thank you.
