## Transcript
**Adelgato**: That's nicer.
**Bclymer**: Let's see here.
**Bclymer**: Well, do you want to move the drawings around?
**Bclymer**: Do you want me to open them up?
**Adelgato**: Well, you.
**Adelgato**: You open them up.
**Adelgato**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: See, how do we share here?
**Jdawson**: Bottom little arrow looks like it's going through.
**Jdawson**: A screen says present.
**Jdawson**: Now it's next to the hand.
**Bclymer**: Gotcha.
**Adelgato**: Oh, you took away your fancy office background.
**Bclymer**: The six keys to success are behind me.
**Bclymer**: That's the only thing.
**Adelgato**: All right.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So I guess first, like, you know, I don't, you know, we're trying to accomplish a couple things today.
**Bclymer**: I think it's.
**Bclymer**: We'd like to know really the finishes and like, you know, where your price point is.
**Bclymer**: You know, what are we expecting?
**Bclymer**: I'm still getting.
**Bclymer**: I haven't got my price yet for like a post tension concrete structure versus just seeing the walls and wood framing.
**Adelgato**: And this looks so much better than it did before.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, that's what I was telling Brandon.
**Bclymer**: I think Europeans, they swing their bathroom doors out for some reason because I went back and changed all the bathroom doors to swing out.
**Bclymer**: But is this the way to put it?
**Bclymer**: Just have all three layouts on it, or do you think we leave the old one in there?
**Adelgato**: Leave the old one so they can see that?
**Adelgato**: I would do that for sure.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Adelgato**: Andreas is coming in.
**Adelgato**: Let me pull my pricing.
**Adelgato**: Give me one second.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Adelgato**: Okay.
**Adelgato**: I initially recommended that we stick around.
**Adelgato**: We start at $2,200 a square foot.
**Adelgato**: Between 700 and $800 a square.
**Adelgato**: A square foot.
**Adelgato**: The reasoning behind that is because I wanted to start off at a million five and then add on with my upgrades so that if I did a 700.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Adelgato**: If I stayed at the $700 per square foot and I stayed at 2200, that would have, you know, my, my intro price would have been a million five, four zero.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And that's square foot, under air.
**Adelgato**: Under air, under air.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So we have basically 538, level one.
**Bclymer**: Just add it all up here.
**Jdawson**: It's at the bottom there, isn't it?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I just got a.
**Bclymer**: I didn't.
**Bclymer**: The garage, I just put as varies, but I'll just do an average on that.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Jdawson**: Is that square footage?
**Jdawson**: Right, so 13,000 square feet, Jesse?
**Bclymer**: Well, it's actually 15 right now.
**Bclymer**: This layout, they're 15,000.
**Bclymer**: So they're like a little over 3,000 square foot each.
**Bclymer**: So you're saying they're too big.
**Bclymer**: Really Heat it under area.
**Adelgato**: What, what, what size did he give them to?
**Jdawson**: To us at 13, 258.
**Bclymer**: They were a Little smaller just because they had those upper floors bumped in so much on level two and three.
**Jdawson**: Basically his original was 2, 20, 2650 square feet per unit.
**Adelgato**: Oh, so he was already bigger than me, than the 22 anyway.
**Adelgato**: And we just grew them by how much?
**Jdawson**: 4, 350 square feet.
**Jdawson**: So you need to, you said, you need your sale price, you said is 1200 a square.
**Adelgato**: No, no, no.
**Adelgato**: I, I wanted to stay around 800 a square.
**Adelgato**: Seven, seven to 800 a square because I wanted my starting price point to be 1500.
**Adelgato**: So I, I didn't want him to get too big.
**Adelgato**: But I've seen their design.
**Adelgato**: Right.
**Adelgato**: But now we're at 26,9.
**Adelgato**: Right.
**Jdawson**: So currently with our changes, you're at 3,000 per unit.
**Jdawson**: His original was 26.50.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Adelgato**: So now I, I went over 2 million.
**Adelgato**: Hold on.
**Adelgato**: Dustin's trying to get in.
**Jdawson**: So your 2 million is your sell price that you want to stay under, right?
**Adelgato**: Yeah, yeah.
**Adelgato**: Now we're over 2 million.
**Jdawson**: So do so as far as, so as far as your minimum square footage, what is that?
**Jdawson**: Is that 2, 000 square feet?
**Jdawson**: 2200, 2200.
**Adelgato**: I mean I like the fact, don't get me wrong, I like the fact that you know, they're, they're grown.
**Adelgato**: But now we really gotta, now, you know, I mean we, we have to really understand that we are, we're going to launch or you know, a product into that area that mostly commands single family homes.
**Adelgato**: Unless you're looking at a crappy ass condo.
**Jdawson**: So at, at 2 million per.
**Jdawson**: What is, what is it that your performance is, are you looking at 300 gross after everything to the owner or what is that number that you're backing into?
**Adelgato**: We don't have his pro forma.
**Adelgato**: We're just talking about comparables and sales.
**Adelgato**: From, from, from the sales viewpoint.
**Bclymer**: Well, when, when you say that the price per square foot you're trying to get to, does it make them more sellable?
**Bclymer**: If we can build them and they, they still fall under that, that price you're trying to go out, there's just a bigger unit or do you.
**Adelgato**: I mean.
**Bclymer**: Do we take off the whole ground floor is occupied space and make that an upgrade?
**Bclymer**: Said take off almost 500.
**Adelgato**: So I have an email from him January 25th that he says we've taken the decision to proceed with five townhomes, 2500 square feet priced at 1.625.
**Adelgato**: Oh, oh, oh.
**Adelgato**: I have some scenarios here.
**Adelgato**: Yeah, this 700, this price per square foot was really his.
**Adelgato**: If we, if we sell like 500 or something a square foot, we start losing money Is are his words.
**Jdawson**: If they sell it at 500 a square.
**Adelgato**: Yeah.
**Adelgato**: So really I can't.
**Adelgato**: I mean we, you know, we, we want to make money.
**Adelgato**: Right.
**Adelgato**: So I wouldn't say anything lower than $700 a square foot.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: For, for this, for the sale price.
**Jdawson**: Right, right.
**Jdawson**: So what.
**Jdawson**: How much did his land cost?
**Jdawson**: Do you know?
**Adelgato**: Yeah, I can find that out.
**Adelgato**: Let me let.
**Adelgato**: Justin and Justin, are you there?
**Adelgato**: Justin?
**Jdawson**: He's muted.
**Jdawson**: There you go.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, here we go.
**Adelgato**: All right.
**Adelgato**: Okay, good.
**Adelgato**: So Dustin, do you remember how much they paid for their land?
**Jdawson**: Off the top of my head, I don't.
**Adelgato**: All right, I'll pull it up.
**Jdawson**: And then did your, Your commission is 7% on the sale, right Regina?
**Adelgato**: 6%.
**Adelgato**: We'll take 7 any day.
**Adelgato**: I mean he stole the land.
**Adelgato**: He didn't.
**Adelgato**: He.
**Adelgato**: I remember him saying that I used to have it in my head, the.
**Jdawson**: Number because I know the girl who acquired it who found it.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I'm just trying to back into his performer real quick.
**Adelgato**: Yeah, let's back into it.
**Adelgato**: I'll get you the sale date.
**Adelgato**: Okay, so he bought it September of 2024.
**Adelgato**: It says 800000 here.
**Bclymer**: That's what you know that's for both houses.
**Adelgato**: Yeah, that's for both.
**Adelgato**: Both.
**Jdawson**: All right, so he's one.
**Adelgato**: Okay, so let me share my screen Jesse so I can show brand my.
**Adelgato**: The numbers he sent me.
**Adelgato**: Now you can see his.
**Jdawson**: Oh yeah, yeah.
**Jdawson**: I mean I, I mean you know, obviously I am not a market expert on the, on the sale of all these things like that.
**Jdawson**: I'm just looking at, at the math here.
**Jdawson**: Like if we say 2500, you know, we'll just say that we're going to do the same for each unit, you know, times 500 gives us a build cost of 1.25.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And if our sale price is 2 million then we add in 120 for your commission plus 160 for the land.
**Jdawson**: That puts him at 153 total investment.
**Jdawson**: And so you know, I don't know what his return is.
**Jdawson**: My thoughts thought is, I mean on a 160, you know, out of pocket and he's gonna have a, let's call it a 30 down on the.
**Jdawson**: The build cost.
**Jdawson**: So if he's 1.2 per, that's 33, so 369.
**Jdawson**: So 300,000.
**Jdawson**: So I mean if he's you know netting 25 return on his out of pocket money inside of two years.
**Jdawson**: That's a pretty decent ROI.
**Adelgato**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, because he's going to have, you know, attorneys fees, permit costs, you know, all that stuff's going to be, you know, call it 200 and miscellaneous.
**Adelgato**: Yeah.
**Adelgato**: I mean, Dustin, you just appraised for 2.2 million over in Stevenson's frame homes.
**Adelgato**: And now I get that those are wood frame homes.
**Adelgato**: So these are super, super luxury townhomes.
**Adelgato**: So we just got to get comfortable with the idea that we're going to be selling these at, you know, 2.5 million or so because they grew and I don't think it's a bad thing they grew.
**Adelgato**: I think the floor plan that Jesse came up with is phenomenal.
**Jdawson**: Oh, I, I agree.
**Jdawson**: I think it's a much better floor plan.
**Jdawson**: It flows better.
**Jdawson**: It's something more the consumer would want anyways.
**Adelgato**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Is buying in that, that range.
**Adelgato**: We're about 2.1 million.
**Adelgato**: We're around there as our starting price point.
**Adelgato**: So.
**Adelgato**: And I think something's happened, gonna happen in the next couple of weeks with the market.
**Jdawson**: So I mean, I think just looking at these numbers, if we did 3,000 square feet at 500 a square build cost, with taking into account his purchase price, your commission and then some miscellaneous expenses, that puts total out of pocket at 2 million per unit.
**Adelgato**: Per unit.
**Jdawson**: Correct.
**Jdawson**: So it's a 10 million, 10 million dollar bill total.
**Jdawson**: Oh.
**Bclymer**: You'Re talking all costs total.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So I've got, like I said, you know, 500 a square.
**Jdawson**: Per unit.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: 500 square per unit plus commission, purchase price of the land.
**Jdawson**: And then I've got 200 per unit baked in for miscellaneous expenses.
**Jdawson**: So attorneys fees, impact fees, all that kind of stuff.
**Jdawson**: So you're talking a million dollars total.
**Jdawson**: So that's a 10 million dollar total build.
**Jdawson**: And at two and a half, you know, that's going to put him at a $15 million sale price.
**Adelgato**: Out of how much?
**Jdawson**: Sorry, 12 and a half million.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So that puts him at, you know, 500,000 in the black.
**Adelgato**: Damn.
**Bclymer**: No, that's not good.
**Adelgato**: Well, look at, look at the email where he put 3.5 mil cap at $700 a square foot.
**Adelgato**: Sounding logical for a penthouse.
**Adelgato**: And then he said his, the town home's next desirable product at 650.
**Adelgato**: I, I don't necessarily agree with the 650, but what do we need to, where do we need to be at Brandon, to get this guy?
**Adelgato**: I mean, I would, I would think he would want to make 30 to 35 profit.
**Adelgato**: Is that not normal in your industry?
**Jdawson**: For us.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I wish I had a house like yours.
**Adelgato**: What's your.
**Adelgato**: What's your.
**Adelgato**: What's your normal.
**Adelgato**: What's what?
**Adelgato**: What are you guys expecting now?
**Jdawson**: I mean, our markup is 10, you know, I mean, you know, sometimes we.
**Jdawson**: We kill it and we'll get, you know, 20.
**Jdawson**: But our typical markup is 10.
**Jdawson**: I mean, we don't have, you know, he.
**Jdawson**: It's funny, he was talking about all these high margins, like, I don't know who you're dealing with, but I want to go work for them.
**Jdawson**: Because nobody makes 50%.
**Jdawson**: I wish.
**Adelgato**: No.
**Jdawson**: But I mean, it's, it's just more along the lines, like, you know, I, I mean, Jesse, I don't know.
**Jdawson**: I mean.
**Jdawson**: 500 a square, like, what do you think of that?
**Bclymer**: Well, that seems like a lot.
**Bclymer**: I was trying to throw some numbers in here on our estimate sheet.
**Jdawson**: Because for them to.
**Jdawson**: For them to demand two and a half, it's got to be top of the line.
**Jdawson**: Oh, yeah.
**Adelgato**: Otherwise they'll go and buy just a single single family.
**Adelgato**: Yeah.
**Adelgato**: You know, and are beautiful, but they don't have amenities.
**Adelgato**: You know, it's not like I can throw in a pool.
**Adelgato**: Of course they have a terrace, but.
**Adelgato**: Yeah, but they don't have pools, so.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I mean, I can.
**Jdawson**: These things demand two and a half, you think?
**Jdawson**: Regina?
**Adelgato**: I mean, I wanted to cop me at two, to be honest with you.
**Adelgato**: It's going to push the market or to push the mark.
**Adelgato**: But I never thought that.
**Adelgato**: Dustin.
**Adelgato**: Justin, I never thought you'd appraise for that house at Stevenson's Creek.
**Adelgato**: Jesse, you know, you know what I'm talking about.
**Adelgato**: I don't.
**Adelgato**: I don't think you.
**Adelgato**: You know the area, Brandon, but if you can think with where Serena is, there's a lake, you know, that Stevenson Lake.
**Adelgato**: And then it's to the south of Sunset Point Road.
**Adelgato**: And then if you go into one of those little streets, you get a lot of like rental duplexes and, and really trashy little places.
**Adelgato**: Anyway, this developer built two wood frame homes on the lake there.
**Adelgato**: And 3,000 square feet, Dustin.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, 3,410 each.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And they're blocked on the bottom and then.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Wood on the top.
**Adelgato**: And he just appraised for 2.2 million.
**Adelgato**: I never thought he would.
**Adelgato**: I mean, I couldn't find calm.
**Jdawson**: So the highest price sold on that street was $800,000.
**Jdawson**: Let's give an envelope to the appraiser.
**Adelgato**: Yes, exactly.
**Adelgato**: Yeah.
**Adelgato**: And so there's a lot going on in that Area, you know, by the time that these guys launch, which he said would be like next year around season, you know, first quarter.
**Adelgato**: I, I mean I dare to say that it, it could be doable.
**Adelgato**: It could be doable, but we're pushing it.
**Adelgato**: Hey, but that's what I'm known for doing, right?
**Adelgato**: I am known for pushing the market and selling just above.
**Adelgato**: And when you, when it's new construction, it's easy, it's easier.
**Adelgato**: So it's not comfortable.
**Adelgato**: But I do think it's doable if we dress them up real nice.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: I mean, yeah.
**Jdawson**: I mean if we knock it down at 3,000 square feet, knock it down to 450 a square, that brings the total investment on his end to 1.860, which gives him 140,000 in profit per unit based off a 2 million dollar sale point.
**Jdawson**: And obviously every 100 is just gravy from there.
**Jdawson**: I, you know, but that gives him.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I mean, I don't know.
**Jdawson**: I mean that's, I guess 2 million is what we're thinking is the bottom.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: So if it's you know, 2, 2, 2, 5, then that puts him at the 3, 340 per unit.
**Jdawson**: So I mean that makes, makes it a little bit more palatable I would think.
**Jdawson**: I mean that puts him at.
**Adelgato**: I.
**Jdawson**: Mean 1.7 million profit on a 10 million.
**Jdawson**: A little.
**Jdawson**: It'd be less than 10 million, be like nine something.
**Jdawson**: That puts them at like 20 over a little bit over probably in margin.
**Jdawson**: I don't know when he bought it, but that's what he bought it this year?
**Adelgato**: Yeah, last year in September.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, so he bought it in September last year.
**Jdawson**: In reality, this is Jesse, what, eight month build time.
**Bclymer**: Max?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So call it.
**Jdawson**: He's got carrying costs for a year.
**Jdawson**: I mean, I don't know.
**Jdawson**: I mean I don't.
**Jdawson**: Again, I don't know what is his minimum profit margin is, but I would think 22% on the bottom end for a year.
**Jdawson**: Investment isn't terrible.
**Adelgato**: We haven't, well, we haven't built in the upgrades yet.
**Jdawson**: What do you mean as far as like the added square footage and whatnot to, to build into the sale price?
**Adelgato**: No, like not the added square footage.
**Adelgato**: I'm talking about the, the finishes, you know.
**Jdawson**: Well, that 450I was saying is all in, including finishes.
**Adelgato**: Okay, that's all in.
**Adelgato**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: But I mean, but that 450 is scraping the bottom of the barrel.
**Jdawson**: Like I, you know, I don't know if you're, if you can demand marble you know, I just don't know if you can get that kind of stuff done, like the true high end stuff that you're looking for.
**Jdawson**: I mean, it.
**Jdawson**: I.
**Jdawson**: It's makes it a little bit tougher.
**Jdawson**: I mean.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I mean, at the end of the day, like, either you push the market or you stay with what you know, you can get.
**Jdawson**: And then you look at what the comparable finishes are, and then it just comes down to, all right, here's what it's going to cost to get this.
**Jdawson**: And you know, are you good with, you know, making that return?
**Jdawson**: Or you, you press the barriers and say, hey, we're going to be the first on the block to do this.
**Jdawson**: It's going to elevate your name.
**Jdawson**: People are going to know.
**Jdawson**: I want to, you know, being a building built by so and so, it's.
**Jdawson**: You got to look at it as a marketing play that pays dividends, I think, for the risk.
**Adelgato**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Well, I mean, or we can always back down the square footage too, right?
**Jdawson**: Because we're basing.
**Adelgato**: That's what I was gonna say.
**Jdawson**: I'm basing these numbers off 3,000 square feet.
**Adelgato**: Yeah, that's what I was gonna say.
**Adelgato**: I said, this is.
**Adelgato**: I, I think that the strategy should be, let's present him this, you know, and I know that he'll be like, oh my God, it's gonna be so expensive.
**Adelgato**: And, you know, we'll just tell him, hey, you know, it'll be.
**Adelgato**: If that.
**Adelgato**: It is.
**Adelgato**: They are, they would be, you know, but, but, you know, we'll pitch it the right way and if we need to scale it back, we can make them smaller.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, you lop off a floor or something like that and redo stuff, whatever.
**Jdawson**: I mean.
**Bclymer**: I mean, one thing I was thinking about, like, if, like to go back to the same square footage and just bring the front of the building back in instead of having it hang over, simplify the construction and even hang in the back and the front over less each way.
**Bclymer**: It makes it easier.
**Jdawson**: And one other thing that could be done is just at the bottom.
**Jdawson**: Any room at the bottom is just an option if someone wants it.
**Jdawson**: That's the upgrade upsell.
**Adelgato**: That's it.
**Jdawson**: So then they just have the two.
**Adelgato**: Fours plus the rooftop.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, you'd have to know that ahead of time because I think we got a bathroom down there, don't we, Jesse?
**Jdawson**: Oh, yeah, that's right.
**Adelgato**: Yeah.
**Adelgato**: But I don't know how much we can, we can shave off just for, for an in law suite.
**Adelgato**: I mean, I think we would be Pushing it for a hundred grand.
**Adelgato**: How much are you building for Miscellaneous?
**Jdawson**: I put 200,000 per unit.
**Jdawson**: So thinking that would cover impact fees, whatever, attorney fees, permit fees, things like that.
**Jdawson**: So that puts a million basically on the project for fees.
**Jdawson**: I mean, I'm just ballparking it, but I'm thinking a percent, right.
**Jdawson**: Or a 10%.
**Adelgato**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: What do we want to pow out through the drawings and see if there's anything else we want to change?
**Jdawson**: I guess we'll just roll with what we got and I guess Regina, you think it will, you know, say, hey, we're looking at a two and a half million dollar sale price on these is the goal with the 225 bottom?
**Adelgato**: Yeah.
**Adelgato**: Well, I'm just running through the numbers one more time before we move on.
**Adelgato**: I want to make sure a 20, 25 profit at least.
**Adelgato**: So.
**Adelgato**: Okay, correct me if I'm wrong.
**Adelgato**: So we're at 3,000 square ft.
**Adelgato**: Construction cost at $500 a square foot.
**Adelgato**: So that ca.
**Adelgato**: Each home's costing me 1 1/2 mil plus $200, 200,000 impact fees, plus the cost of the land, 160 plus the commission.
**Adelgato**: Do I need to add anything else to that?
**Jdawson**: I mean those are the basics.
**Jdawson**: The base, I mean the miscellaneous hopefully carries the decent.
**Jdawson**: I mean it's a decent little carry.
**Jdawson**: I mean 10%.
**Jdawson**: So yeah.
**Adelgato**: Okay, so in order for him to get 25 profit, we would have to sell this.
**Adelgato**: These at 2.7 million.
**Jdawson**: God, Regina, you're just, you give me challenges.
**Bclymer**: I mean Stevenson was a challenge.
**Adelgato**: Yeah.
**Adelgato**: And this is next year.
**Adelgato**: So you know, hold your breath for Trump and this tariff thing to really help us.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I mean I, I know but.
**Adelgato**: But I think with.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: That price though someone might go single family without any amenities or anything.
**Adelgato**: Yeah.
**Adelgato**: Unless it's an investor that wants.
**Adelgato**: Yeah.
**Adelgato**: Okay, let's, let's, let's move on to the floor plan because I have about 15 minutes.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So like here, you know, share your screen.
**Jdawson**: Jesse.
**Adelgato**: Unknown caller.
**Bclymer**: So these are basically.
**Bclymer**: We just tried, we.
**Bclymer**: I worked this around.
**Bclymer**: Try to put the tub in there.
**Bclymer**: Is that what you were asking and thinking?
**Adelgato**: Yeah, just like Serena.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Adelgato**: Okay, cool.
**Bclymer**: It's pretty much the same, same class.
**Bclymer**: So would all closets that be upgrade for the built ins and we just put wire shelving in there for the standard or should we.
**Adelgato**: No, you know, build out those closets.
**Bclymer**: Build out closets.
**Adelgato**: That's an upgrade, Jesse.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Adelgato**: Yeah, we're gonna do a European built out closet and upgrade and we're gonna charge a Nice upgrade.
**Bclymer**: Okay, we'll just put wire shelving in these for now.
**Adelgato**: Yeah.
**Adelgato**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: That's what I guess I was asking.
**Bclymer**: Is it our base price?
**Adelgato**: I would just have it as a.
**Adelgato**: As a blank slate.
**Adelgato**: I wouldn't even.
**Adelgato**: Same wire shelving.
**Bclymer**: It's an open room.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: Is the washer, dryer that laid out what you were thinking.
**Adelgato**: But how do you get them?
**Adelgato**: How do you get in?
**Adelgato**: I don't get it.
**Bclymer**: Whether.
**Bclymer**: Be like, these doors would be, you know, they would open up, and you get in the front of the front of them on this side.
**Jdawson**: What's our height?
**Jdawson**: Jesse, can you flip that, make it stackable?
**Bclymer**: You can regine.
**Bclymer**: I didn't think you thought, like, stackables.
**Adelgato**: You know, my penthouse has a stackable.
**Adelgato**: I don't mind it because I have a sink right next to it.
**Adelgato**: But I don't.
**Adelgato**: I.
**Adelgato**: I don't know that you.
**Adelgato**: You have all that room in here or is the h.
**Adelgato**: Oh, no, you got the AC in there, so you're going to close that up.
**Adelgato**: You need a door there so they don't see the ac.
**Adelgato**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Just put a bifold door.
**Bclymer**: You can.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Adelgato**: Yeah.
**Adelgato**: You don't want a drama like.
**Adelgato**: Like you had with me and my open DC utility room.
**Adelgato**: That was drama.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Jdawson**: That was drama, man.
**Adelgato**: And I don't know about bifold doors there.
**Adelgato**: That looks weird, guys.
**Adelgato**: I would close it out and make it a regular door.
**Jdawson**: Well, no, I.
**Jdawson**: I think instead what we would do is actually extend that wall to where it's even with the washer and then do a pocket door.
**Adelgato**: Yeah, exactly.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And then you could even, you know, you can do a pocket door on a few of these other tight spots, too.
**Jdawson**: Jesse.
**Bclymer**: I hate pocket doors.
**Jdawson**: Why?
**Bclymer**: Because they're.
**Adelgato**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: A nightmare.
**Adelgato**: Here's a point.
**Adelgato**: Pocket doors kind of have a.
**Adelgato**: I don't know.
**Adelgato**: They're.
**Adelgato**: They're not too luxury.
**Jdawson**: I love them.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, but when you put in 100 of them on a job like this, they run screws through the drywall into the framing on half of them.
**Bclymer**: And don't do that.
**Adelgato**: Unknown caller.
**Bclymer**: Okay, but we can show that.
**Bclymer**: I guess it'll look cooler here.
**Bclymer**: What we do later is fine.
**Bclymer**: But you're saying it could also be just a swinging door.
**Adelgato**: I'm saying it could just be a swinging door.
**Jdawson**: Just swing in.
**Adelgato**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And you're talking make these stackable so they're up against, like, this wall.
**Adelgato**: I would leave them like that for now.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And as in here.
**Bclymer**: Would you.
**Bclymer**: Should we.
**Bclymer**: Would you prefer A bigger closet or.
**Bclymer**: And move this wall this way.
**Bclymer**: Make the shower a little smaller.
**Adelgato**: Yeah.
**Adelgato**: That's a long shower, huh?
**Bclymer**: Could come over here or something.
**Adelgato**: Yeah, I would do that.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: In the.
**Bclymer**: The master bedroom, did you say you were.
**Bclymer**: Was there any other changes in here or.
**Bclymer**: That was it.
**Adelgato**: That's good.
**Adelgato**: No, Looks good to me.
**Bclymer**: All right, we have the dining room where we put your breakfast nook.
**Adelgato**: Oh, that looks good.
**Adelgato**: Now, where's my pantry, though?
**Adelgato**: All the way down?
**Bclymer**: Well, yeah, the pantry's all the way there first.
**Bclymer**: Or there's this one here.
**Bclymer**: There's this other layout.
**Bclymer**: This was the other option for kitchen, leaving the island over here against the wall.
**Adelgato**: Let's give them that option.
**Bclymer**: A little smaller nook.
**Bclymer**: You could always make this smaller on this one, too, and put the pantry there.
**Adelgato**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I think thinking was we had this.
**Bclymer**: The tall cabinet on this one, like in my unit.
**Bclymer**: I believe so.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, that was on the end here.
**Adelgato**: Yeah.
**Adelgato**: It's a lot of cabinetry.
**Adelgato**: Now.
**Bclymer**: Between these two, which do you think?
**Bclymer**: Or it's both of them are just a person's choice.
**Adelgato**: I think it's a choice.
**Adelgato**: But when you look at the.
**Adelgato**: The far one, you're not going to have a lot of cabinets, so you have such a big window there.
**Adelgato**: You don't have a lot of cabinets.
**Adelgato**: So I personally like the island.
**Adelgato**: I don't care that the pantry is all the way over there.
**Adelgato**: Fine.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And.
**Bclymer**: And again, on the.
**Jdawson**: We.
**Bclymer**: If we shrink the square footage back where we taken the building to reduce the square footage, like, how much do you think the.
**Bclymer**: So you're saying the selling point really doesn't matter after what you were trying to get to the 2200 square feet a unit?
**Adelgato**: Oh, well, I'll never got to 2200.
**Adelgato**: Not.
**Adelgato**: I mean, they gave me 2600 and we had to mess with it.
**Adelgato**: So I think what the pitch is going to have to be is just like us, this.
**Adelgato**: This floor plan versus theirs.
**Adelgato**: And.
**Adelgato**: And seeing if, you know, if our pro.
**Adelgato**: If our.
**Adelgato**: If our guesstimate of their performance.
**Adelgato**: Right.
**Adelgato**: You know.
**Bclymer**: And you're saying that, well, we'll go back, revisit anything.
**Bclymer**: But then here's the roof, which really didn't change much other than shifting when the stairs shifted over.
**Adelgato**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: For that room.
**Adelgato**: That's beautiful.
**Adelgato**: This is a big selling point right here.
**Bclymer**: As far as the.
**Bclymer**: The surface on here.
**Bclymer**: Is it, you know, to put all the wood deck and all that up here?
**Adelgato**: Yeah.
**Adelgato**: Or we could do astrograss.
**Adelgato**: No, in some parts, I love to do Astrograss.
**Adelgato**: Wood deck and astrograss.
**Bclymer**: Look over here or something.
**Adelgato**: Do we have some shelter from the sun here or.
**Adelgato**: No.
**Jdawson**: I mean, you could, you could do a wind sale.
**Jdawson**: That would be your cost effective solution, you know?
**Jdawson**: Or you can do a Pergo as an add on.
**Adelgato**: Yeah, we could do that.
**Adelgato**: Huh.
**Bclymer**: Because I think if this is like a planter.
**Adelgato**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: On the side you could put a post here.
**Jdawson**: I mean, they.
**Jdawson**: They show six posts right there.
**Jdawson**: Jesse.
**Jdawson**: I think they're probably showing that that's covered right there with something.
**Bclymer**: Open that up.
**Jdawson**: What's this address?
**Jdawson**: Regina?
**Adelgato**: 39 Turner Street.
**Bclymer**: Oh, yeah, they're showing something covering that.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah, they.
**Jdawson**: They've already got a Pergo up there.
**Adelgato**: Great.
**Jdawson**: Oh, yeah.
**Adelgato**: I don't know.
**Adelgato**: These are looking pretty sweet.
**Adelgato**: I'm, I'm not too scared of, of the size, but they might.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Question is, is, you know, I was pointing up on Google Maps to see if it's that terrorism.
**Jdawson**: Million dollar view or not.
**Jdawson**: I mean, they could see over that small little house on the back side, which is good.
**Adelgato**: He says.
**Adelgato**: Yes.
**Adelgato**: He says that you can.
**Adelgato**: You have a nice view from, from the, the third floor and the terrace.
**Bclymer**: Or.
**Bclymer**: There it is right there.
**Bclymer**: Water.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that's just a rendering.
**Jdawson**: I'm curious what it actually looks like because they've got apartments and stuff back there.
**Adelgato**: Yeah.
**Adelgato**: Dustin, when can you.
**Adelgato**: When can you set up a time for us?
**Jdawson**: I know Ruslan's gonna be back next week, so we could just.
**Jdawson**: I can just find out what time next week works.
**Adelgato**: Great.
**Jdawson**: We're.
**Jdawson**: We're booked on Tuesday.
**Jdawson**: We've got a presentation, so probably the.
**Jdawson**: Probably best to do Wednesday or later Thursday.
**Adelgato**: Okay.
**Adelgato**: Well, good.
**Adelgato**: I mean, I think it's a fantastic floor plan.
**Adelgato**: Let's see what happens.
**Jdawson**: I do, too.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And then by then, we'll get some more pricing in and we can dial in our construction cost as well.
**Adelgato**: Sounds good.
**Adelgato**: Okay, guys.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: What were you saying, Regina?
**Bclymer**: You thought big news was coming?
**Adelgato**: I'm just optimistic.
**Adelgato**: I'm just optimistic in the market.
**Adelgato**: I just think, you know, all this, all this money's being pumped back into the economy.
**Adelgato**: Inflation, Inflation rates are down.
**Adelgato**: The feds are getting pressured.
**Adelgato**: The interest rates are going down little by little.
**Adelgato**: Everybody's scared about the tariffs.
**Adelgato**: But I think.
**Adelgato**: I think, you know, once we start getting more offers that, you know, this uncertainty in the market's going to calm down and, and we'll feel a lot better, especially when it comes to peak season next year.
**Adelgato**: So I think this is good timing.
**Jdawson**: Well, I mean, only one of two things are going to happen.
**Jdawson**: Either you're right and we're celebrating, or you're wrong and it really doesn't matter.
**Adelgato**: Exactly.
**Jdawson**: So you might as well just stick with right.
**Adelgato**: Exactly.
**Adelgato**: It's the funner.
**Adelgato**: It's the funner and it feels better.
**Adelgato**: So let's be optimistic.
**Jdawson**: In the world's falling.
**Adelgato**: Yeah.
**Adelgato**: Awesome.
**Adelgato**: Okay, guys.
**Jdawson**: Perfect.
**Adelgato**: Thank you.
**Jdawson**: Thank you.
**Jdawson**: Thank you.
**Jdawson**: All right, Back on a time.
**Bclymer**: All right, thanks.
**Jdawson**: Bye.
**Adelgato**: By.
