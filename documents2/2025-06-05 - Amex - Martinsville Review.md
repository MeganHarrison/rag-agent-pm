## Transcript
**Jdawson**: Hey, folks, how we doing?
**Mparsons**: Good.
**Mparsons**: How are you?
**Kmass**: Hey, J.P.
**Kmass**: hey.
**Jdawson**: Okay, sorry.
**Jdawson**: Multitasking.
**Jdawson**: So Martinsville MX.
**Jdawson**: So Mike is down there now.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: My understandings.
**Kmass**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Kmass**: On site.
**Bclymer**: So let me pull up my stuff here.
**Jdawson**: Just.
**Jdawson**: I sent some new drawings.
**Jdawson**: Well, latest I had there really.
**Jdawson**: There wasn't a whole lot of change in the, in the detail.
**Jdawson**: But I guess I need to, you know, we, we have an August, you know, not a, you know, sometime in August, kind of go live date.
**Jdawson**: And so I want to make sure at this point that we're clear on the scope.
**Jdawson**: I know there was, you know, obviously they're down there kind of doing some more discovery, but, you know, the biggest thing is this fencing and obviously the, you know, the electrical drops and whatnot.
**Jdawson**: So first I'll just go over, like to make sure we're clear on the scope and get any questions from that.
**Bclymer**: So let me share my screen here.
**Bclymer**: There we go.
**Bclymer**: Sharing.
**Jdawson**: So you should have this.
**Jdawson**: And I.
**Jdawson**: And there is a second part of this, the whole Godiva thing.
**Jdawson**: I know that's out there.
**Jdawson**: I just don't have enough detail on that yet.
**Jdawson**: Godiva hasn't consented.
**Jdawson**: So I'd rather, you know, kind of wait until they.
**Kmass**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Really give us, you know, and then we'll have a drawing in space.
**Jdawson**: And it'll mostly be, you know, some electrical and some H vac.
**Jdawson**: Well, actually two on a devising wall.
**Bclymer**: So it'll.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So anyway, we're basically building a new freezer type area for them.
**Jdawson**: But anyway, if they, you know, if they agree to go in that building, they're.
**Jdawson**: They're.
**Jdawson**: They haven't done that yet.
**Jdawson**: But anyway, so from our scope, we still have in.
**Jdawson**: In building one, obviously the fencing.
**Jdawson**: So I know you sent.
**Jdawson**: I sent the first design I sent through.
**Jdawson**: They were fine with no issues.
**Jdawson**: So I guess it is up to, you know, I didn't send the second one through because I wanted to understand, you know, what, what the cost difference was because that'll make a difference of which one they like better.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: So I really need to understand cost timeline, what's.
**Jdawson**: We need to find the best, the most cost effective.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: I understand.
**Jdawson**: With.
**Jdawson**: If we don't have to build a ceiling, that's great.
**Jdawson**: I'd rather not just because the second one basically was basically a narrow hold fencing.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: That goes right up to the joists.
**Kmass**: Right, right.
**Jdawson**: So not, you know, just, just a big cage.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Kmass**: So I would think that would help because you wouldn't have anything, you know, blocking the light coming down and the one fence that contractor said, you know, they've never put us.
**Kmass**: You know, they do these fence enclosures all the time, but they never put a ceiling in one.
**Kmass**: So they kind of didn't know how to do it other than, you know, our details.
**Kmass**: So.
**Kmass**: And we've been pushing them and trying to get them to give us a budget number.
**Kmass**: And Candon, I don't know if that guy got back to you today or not, but, I mean, we're not yet.
**Jdawson**: I also gave him a call first thing this morning.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, because that's the biggest thing.
**Jdawson**: I mean, I think they'd go for anything aesthetically fine.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: But that mostly, you know, it obviously meets the specs and no one can, you know, pass credit cards through, essentially.
**Jdawson**: I mean, that's what we're looking for.
**Kmass**: Do you have an idea of a budget for this thing?
**Jdawson**: No, no, I.
**Jdawson**: No one's giving me a budget.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I can.
**Jdawson**: I can talk to her.
**Jdawson**: I haven't seen the Capex form.
**Bclymer**: I'm trying to.
**Bclymer**: Look, I don't think I have a Capex form because they.
**Bclymer**: I don't think they had no.
**Bclymer**: I don't have a CAB X form.
**Jdawson**: I can ask Our.
**Jdawson**: Our engineer usually has that.
**Jdawson**: There is some kind of budget, but I'll try and get that.
**Jdawson**: But in the meantime, I think I'd like to cleaner because the other one with all, you know, was great.
**Jdawson**: I appreciate the effort, but with all the, you know, trying to minimize the.
**Jdawson**: The, you know, supports from the ceiling, you know, with the angle iron or angle iron.
**Jdawson**: I was called iron.
**Jdawson**: It's not necessarily iron, but with the angles and, you know, totally, you know, like to design custom.
**Jdawson**: But if this is just.
**Jdawson**: We can put fence and posts in the ground, you know, you know, obviously it's a little.
**Jdawson**: You have to work a little higher, but it should be fairly straightforward.
**Jdawson**: And just make sure we have the gate openings right.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Pretty clean.
**Kmass**: Yeah, they got those details that, you know, we'll still have a hollow metal door frame and door, but they have closure strips and they have a frame that.
**Kmass**: That supports the door.
**Kmass**: So you don't have to build a wall.
**Kmass**: And then you have nothing blocking the view in or out, which I like.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, it's very transparent.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, so I just need a.
**Jdawson**: I just need, like.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Not exact.
**Jdawson**: At least the budget in the realm price.
**Jdawson**: And then I'll go with them to the fence with the fence and try and get that approved.
**Jdawson**: Because I'm at this point, you know, we're in the middle of, you know, Start of June.
**Jdawson**: So we need to get.
**Jdawson**: My assumption is, you know, we need to get that.
**Jdawson**: I'd like to get that ordered and scheduled because I, at this point I have.
**Jdawson**: I don't have any cost and I don't have a, you know, a schedule.
**Jdawson**: So that's what I need to get to.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: All right, so we got.
**Jdawson**: That's.
**Jdawson**: I'm showing you that.
**Jdawson**: I didn't mean to.
**Bclymer**: That's my files, but whatever.
**Jdawson**: Hold on a second.
**Bclymer**: Let me get rid of this.
**Bclymer**: There we go.
**Jdawson**: So, yeah, we also have that truck cage, right.
**Jdawson**: That's going to Dr.
**Jdawson**: 23.
**Jdawson**: So need, you know, pricing timing on that.
**Jdawson**: And then we have the server room which needs to be built out.
**Jdawson**: I sent.
**Bclymer**: Where am I.
**Bclymer**: I only have the CADS or the.
**Jdawson**: The PDFs.
**Jdawson**: But, you know, it's really expanding this room.
**Jdawson**: You know, the mechanical stuff that we asked for.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Jdawson**: So I need.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So basically I need to get.
**Jdawson**: You know, that's still in.
**Jdawson**: No difference.
**Bclymer**: The.
**Jdawson**: All the stuff we'd still like to have.
**Jdawson**: Like I said, I don't.
**Jdawson**: I have to find out where the fiber entry point is coming and I'll follow up on that.
**Jdawson**: But.
**Jdawson**: And then the, the electrical is all still the same.
**Jdawson**: All the circuits, you know, for the, for the enclosure, there's those two UPS units that we need moved and.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, so there's really.
**Jdawson**: And a demo is all separate.
**Jdawson**: That could be a separate, you know, cost.
**Jdawson**: And I'm not concerned about the timeline there at the moment, but I need to get this first part.
**Bclymer**: I need like cost and timeline, you.
**Jdawson**: Know, when we're going to start.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: And then any questions you have.
**Jdawson**: So, I mean, we have.
**Jdawson**: Because that's, you know, this, this drawing hasn't changed.
**Jdawson**: This is the cage for the 23.
**Jdawson**: You know, we have the circuits here for the.
**Jdawson**: The idf.
**Jdawson**: And so really nothing has changed.
**Jdawson**: I think it was mainly just understanding where you were getting the power from.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Kmass**: And they should have all the power stuff worked out today.
**Kmass**: The.
**Kmass**: This will be like card control or like access control on these.
**Kmass**: Yeah, these doors into.
**Kmass**: There is.
**Kmass**: Do you have a vendor that's going to actually do that if we just coordinate the hardware we're buying?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah, we have our own.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we have.
**Bclymer**: I forgot they just changed their name.
**Jdawson**: But we have our own security vendor that always does.
**Jdawson**: Does all of our wiring and.
**Bclymer**: And devices.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we can definitely coordinate that.
**Bclymer**: But yeah.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So yeah, I'm looking for you guys.
**Jdawson**: I'm looking for.
**Jdawson**: You know, main thing is the Cost on the.
**Jdawson**: On that second fence, you know, the second fence design.
**Jdawson**: And I'll send that through in the.
**Bclymer**: And the.
**Jdawson**: And the pictures and get that approved.
**Jdawson**: And then it's like, when can we, you know, the other stuff can, you know, get me pricing.
**Jdawson**: But you can get out.
**Jdawson**: I'm not as concerned.
**Jdawson**: You can get out and start.
**Bclymer**: Right?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, just let me know, because this is, you know, like I said, I think there's even some drops up in that area that can be reused.
**Jdawson**: So, yeah, I'd like to get started.
**Jdawson**: You know, we have a little bit of time.
**Jdawson**: I'm not panicking or anything.
**Jdawson**: It's not a lot of work, to be honest.
**Jdawson**: It's just really laying it out.
**Jdawson**: But if I'd like to in the next two weeks, have all the costs and a nice schedule that we could work on, because the.
**Bclymer**: The.
**Jdawson**: Probably the most complicated is the generator piece.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Obviously, we don't.
**Jdawson**: We can't move the generator.
**Jdawson**: I don't know if we.
**Jdawson**: I think we talked about whether.
**Jdawson**: I think the question was whether it was more cost effective to move it, you know, relocate it and do a temporary generator or just get a new generator.
**Kmass**: So today.
**Kmass**: Today, the.
**Kmass**: The electricians will confirm that panel that we're using and the size of it.
**Kmass**: And then we have a generator guy in Indy that has unlimited access to generators, because we could even get one that's, like, barely used or.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we have out there.
**Jdawson**: You haven't seen it, Jesse.
**Jdawson**: But yeah, barely used would be a big improvement, so.
**Kmass**: Yeah, exactly.
**Kmass**: So.
**Kmass**: And he.
**Kmass**: We could.
**Kmass**: That's why I'm confident we'll find out what we need for that generator and we can get one, like, in a week or something like that.
**Kmass**: Because they're out there for sure.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, because we don't have to.
**Jdawson**: I mean, they'll probably want, like, if we just put in a new one that obviously is cleaner, and then we probably.
**Jdawson**: Then we probably have to understand we'd have to ask the landlord.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: We don't need this generator.
**Jdawson**: We're not.
**Jdawson**: Do you want us to.
**Jdawson**: Do we have to demo it?
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Jdawson**: You know, pull the fit.
**Jdawson**: So then that might be added to the demo.
**Jdawson**: But that would be fun.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Kmass**: And the demo scope, you know, Mike, you know, that's.
**Kmass**: It wasn't listed there, I don't think, on your sheet.
**Kmass**: But we have to take down the existing cage.
**Kmass**: Right.
**Kmass**: And there exists, like, what.
**Kmass**: All in the existing side.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So in building two.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: We have the whole freezer thing.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: So the land Corps confirmed that that's going to come down.
**Jdawson**: There's in that building, too.
**Jdawson**: There's some.
**Jdawson**: There's some offices that look like, you know, I don't know, receiving office or whatever.
**Jdawson**: Makeshift office in the middle of the space there.
**Jdawson**: I assume it's just like drywall and studs has to come down.
**Jdawson**: There's a bathroom area that stays.
**Jdawson**: I think that's made out of block.
**Jdawson**: I call them blue because they are.
**Jdawson**: I guess they're painted blue.
**Jdawson**: So they're blue interior offices.
**Jdawson**: And then, you know, we do have to demolish the existing Amex cage, the chicken wire and then.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And I do have your demo.
**Jdawson**: Existing generator shed.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Because.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Even if we're moving it right, we want that space clearer.
**Jdawson**: But I'll.
**Jdawson**: I'll confirm that.
**Jdawson**: If we're not moving a generator, does the, the landlord want it moved?
**Jdawson**: So we.
**Jdawson**: But this, you know, I don't know why they built that whole shed and everything.
**Bclymer**: I mean, generators are made to.
**Jdawson**: The shed's uglier than the generator.
**Jdawson**: I mean, generators are made to be outside.
**Jdawson**: It's not like they're.
**Kmass**: Right.
**Jdawson**: So you don't really use it in a garage.
**Jdawson**: But anyway, I'll figure that out.
**Jdawson**: But yeah, so just, I, I would.
**Jdawson**: I.
**Jdawson**: What I would do for the demo, you know, the cost of all that.
**Jdawson**: I know we got some preliminary numbers on the.
**Jdawson**: Just from a budget for, for the freezer, but for all that stuff, I would just assume you're.
**Jdawson**: You're.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Taking it out.
**Jdawson**: Heck, I can't imagine they want to leave it there.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Bclymer**: Generator and shed.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So, yeah, not a big deal.
**Jdawson**: But just like I said, they're just like what the.
**Jdawson**: Probably the, the.
**Jdawson**: Like I said, figuring out the generator panel, getting a new generator in there.
**Jdawson**: This UPS stuff, I don't have a lot of detail on.
**Jdawson**: All I knew is they want to move what's existing and you know, hook that up so that the.
**Jdawson**: The electric is going to have to say, you know, take a look at that and see what it's going to take to.
**Jdawson**: To move those.
**Jdawson**: Because if we.
**Jdawson**: That even if we had like, the problem is, all right, we can put a new generator.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Which is great.
**Jdawson**: And I guess we'll just have to tell them, look, you know, we're going to take these UPS units offline at a certain date, right.
**Jdawson**: And, you know, transfer them over.
**Jdawson**: We'll just have to cross our fingers that we don't have a power outage right in the middle of, you know, because I'm assuming those will be like the last things to move.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Jdawson**: We'll get everything set up.
**Jdawson**: You can get everything powered up.
**Jdawson**: And then, you know, the UPS is just, you know, obviously a temporary, you know, power for the gen, you know, while the generator starts up.
**Jdawson**: So we just have to figure out the timing of that move, that's all.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Kmass**: Yeah, because we.
**Kmass**: By having that, getting a different generator, it'll be all set up, tested powers on, so that whatever time it takes them to move, physically move it and plug it back in is the only downtime they should have.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And it's right next door, so it's not like they're taking days.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: So it's just a matter of, you.
**Kmass**: Know, wheeling it over there on a cart.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jdawson**: Half a day.
**Jdawson**: So we'll just have to coordinate that.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I mean, I think it's pretty straightforward.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I just wanted to make sure you guys had the latest.
**Jdawson**: We were, you know, obviously finish up, you know, whatever details you need on site and then focus on, you know, focus on getting the cage cost and approval.
**Jdawson**: But in the meantime, once the electrician is, you know, good to go with their, you know, where they're feeding things from, let's, you know, give me a date to get out there.
**Bclymer**: We'll.
**Jdawson**: We'll get it scheduled and make sure the space is available and all that stuff.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I'd rather get a little.
**Jdawson**: Little head start and just be waiting on other people than.
**Bclymer**: Than.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, absolutely.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Because, you know, the holiday will come and next thing you know, will be July, fourth week.
**Jdawson**: You know what I mean?
**Jdawson**: So anyway, so, okay.
**Jdawson**: You guys have any specific questions for me?
**Kmass**: I think we're good on Martinsville.
**Kmass**: Kevin, you got any questions?
**Kmass**: Or Camden?
**Bclymer**: Nope, not a Martinsville.
**Kmass**: Okay, are we moving on to Avon?
**Kmass**: J.P.
**Kmass**: we can.
**Jdawson**: We can.
**Bclymer**: Perfect.
**Kmass**: We got your drawing and the updated scope sheet you put together.
**Jdawson**: Yes, we're changing.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Kmass**: Did Kevin get that CAD file from you so we can get it to our electrician?
**Jdawson**: Yes, because I sent that via.
**Jdawson**: What was that?
**Jdawson**: Kite works because it's like 30 megs.
**Jdawson**: Did you guys get that?
**Jdawson**: I shared it to Keba and you.
**Bclymer**: Jesse.
**Jdawson**: That would have been yesterday.
**Jdawson**: After yesterday afternoon, something from Kite Works.
**Jdawson**: I don't know how it comes over.
**Kmass**: One of.
**Kmass**: Went to my junk folder and I tossed it.
**Bclymer**: Let me.
**Jdawson**: I'll try.
**Jdawson**: Because it was first time I was using.
**Jdawson**: That's our sharing.
**Jdawson**: First time I was using it.
**Bclymer**: Let me just see if I can.
**Bclymer**: How did I pull that up before?
**Bclymer**: Because it's like a Oh I know it works.
**Jdawson**: Yeah I know I sent that yesterday.
**Bclymer**: No I think I know.
**Bclymer**: There we go.
**Jdawson**: Just make sure because it could it'll.
**Bclymer**: Tell you but yesterday I don't my.
**Jdawson**: Folder.
**Bclymer**: Track activity members to copy the.
**Jdawson**: Link Let me see if I can.
**Bclymer**: Just send it now to you guys.
**Bclymer**: So there's a link that maybe I can send here.
**Jdawson**: It doesn't sound.
**Jdawson**: Doesn't sound like you guys got it.
**Kmass**: So I don't see it I don't.
**Bclymer**: Setting it now.
**Jdawson**: But link let me.
**Bclymer**: Know if you guys can send it to you Kevin, Jesse hopefully that goes.
**Jdawson**: Through.
**Bclymer**: I tried to share it email.
**Kmass**: Sorry I got one okay.
**Jdawson**: See if that link works.
**Kmass**: Yeah but you're able to open that thing up.
**Mparsons**: Get into it right now see so I need to create a user for this website or can I just into my email it should let.
**Jdawson**: Me in I don't know because that's the first time I'm using this application.
**Bclymer**: So I'm not sure I need to create anybody upload new.
**Jdawson**: Members Okay I.
**Mparsons**: Just entered my email and it says that I need permissions to access this folder.
**Jdawson**: Okay so is there a place where you can request the access?
**Bclymer**: It's good.
**Jdawson**: You would think it would.
**Bclymer**: Ask me Let me see if it's sending me anything because I'm trying to.
**Jdawson**: Look to see if I can add.
**Bclymer**: Exploration.
**Mparsons**: So this is what I see.
**Bclymer**: Hold on let me get back to that screen.
**Jdawson**: Need permission access Please ask the follow.
**Bclymer**: To share with you yeah that's all right.
**Jdawson**: Hold on Verify your.
**Bclymer**: Let me see Give up I can just do this once if you have it.
**Jdawson**: I think that's good enough.
**Bclymer**: Sorry KMS maybe it's difficult to reach out group all right there's a sharing in progress.
**Jdawson**: Completed it says.
**Bclymer**: Spirit with kmas at pay a few refreshments and a leader group did share that in this one it's another activity trying to do it again not very intuitive this thing.
**Kmass**: That'S.
**Bclymer**: Well how the hell do.
**Jdawson**: I give permission I can put you in there.
**Bclymer**: I tried to share it with you Request files Not requesting files.
**Kmass**: Excuse me one second.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, sorry.
**Bclymer**: I'm trying to.
**Jdawson**: Because it said.
**Jdawson**: It said I shared it with you.
**Bclymer**: Yesterday but you're not seeing it.
**Jdawson**: Let me try it again or sending.
**Bclymer**: File Can I send the file.
**Kmass**: Something?
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: So that looks like it just sent.
**Bclymer**: It to you your email Eva it's or saying it's sending so it should be Avon Cad.
**Bclymer**: It's going to be a positive okay.
**Mparsons**: So so I see three attachments.
**Mparsons**: There is.
**Jdawson**: Just One drawing.
**Mparsons**: It's a PDF and the schedule of.
**Mparsons**: Sorry, a scope of work.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So that was one email.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: So in one email I sent the PDF version and this.
**Jdawson**: The revised scope of work and the CAD that was coming from Kite Works, that would have been a separate.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So it's still saying it's sending to you.
**Bclymer**: Still in the works.
**Bclymer**: As far as.
**Bclymer**: Seeing as I say it's been completed yet.
**Jdawson**: Like, what I'm looking at is see, maybe we can just at least go over the PDF or the scope of work.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: And then because I'm.
**Jdawson**: This is what I'm looking at.
**Jdawson**: Like my Kite Works, I'm sharing is saying I shared a drawing yesterday and.
**Bclymer**: I'm not disputing you didn't get it.
**Jdawson**: But it's telling me I shared it.
**Jdawson**: And then it's sending to you now.
**Jdawson**: So I see.
**Jdawson**: We'll see if it comes through.
**Jdawson**: Otherwise I'll have to do some digging to see how I.
**Jdawson**: Because it doesn't tell me like, hey, you can.
**Jdawson**: There's nowhere to say, hey, you know, add, like give permission.
**Jdawson**: You know, I mean, like I'm trying.
**Bclymer**: To find, download, rename, add new versions, task at least.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah, I don't track.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: It seems to be.
**Mparsons**: So I'm going to share my screen.
**Mparsons**: So the.
**Mparsons**: The last email you just sent, there's another link to it that I clicked and that is allowing me to create an account.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: So maybe that should work.
**Jdawson**: Okay, well, let's.
**Jdawson**: Let me do this.
**Jdawson**: Let's go over the.
**Jdawson**: I have the latest drawing.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so go over what.
**Jdawson**: And I'm gonna.
**Jdawson**: Because I.
**Jdawson**: Where's my Word document?
**Jdawson**: It'll be kind of conjunction with.
**Jdawson**: Oh, that's the wrong word document.
**Bclymer**: Where's my one from?
**Bclymer**: Hold on a second.
**Bclymer**: We're going to go to.
**Bclymer**: Let's do this.
**Bclymer**: Well, 52.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Jdawson**: In there.
**Jdawson**: And we can go back and forth.
**Jdawson**: I highlighted what's changed, which looks like a lot, but more.
**Jdawson**: Some of it is more updating, blah, blah, blah.
**Jdawson**: And see, some of it didn't change and I tried to take out.
**Jdawson**: So there's a lot of scope that's still to be determined.
**Jdawson**: Stuff with little sleepies, a guard shack, time clocks, temporary break rooms.
**Jdawson**: That's all coming, but I just took it out.
**Jdawson**: For right now, I just need the core.
**Jdawson**: So I'm considering this top part, the core scope of work.
**Jdawson**: What I need to get timelines on permit plans, you know, all that stuff.
**Jdawson**: Because some of this other stuff, I mean, it's a temporary break room.
**Jdawson**: You know, a couple time clocks, you know, and we obviously we can add the things.
**Jdawson**: So I don't, I don't want to hold things up because I don't know where the temporary restroom's going.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Jdawson**: So anyway, so the dock doors, there's still 30 new positions.
**Jdawson**: They haven't changed.
**Jdawson**: We're still.
**Jdawson**: I know we changed to Fairborn.
**Jdawson**: I'm still waiting for official like written permission to order.
**Jdawson**: Hopefully get that today.
**Jdawson**: So that's still up.
**Jdawson**: There are 20 existing, existing DOC doors that we're going to use that don't have dock locks.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: So we have to add 20 dock locks to the order.
**Jdawson**: These are the doors that go on.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: And obviously there's power required with them as well.
**Jdawson**: So we're adding 20 existing dock locks to existing doors.
**Jdawson**: These are the doors.
**Jdawson**: There's 21 doors we're going to use that are existing, that we don't have a fan or a light, again, whatever, you know, match existing.
**Jdawson**: These are the doors.
**Jdawson**: Power required.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: So we're fairly sure.
**Kmass**: Yeah, we're providing.
**Kmass**: We're providing those dock locks and those fans and.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, and we need the power.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So yeah, so that's an ad obviously to the overall order.
**Jdawson**: I want to, especially the dock locks.
**Bclymer**: Wanted to make sure we got.
**Jdawson**: It's another 20.
**Jdawson**: So it's significant.
**Jdawson**: Obviously.
**Bclymer**: Hit charger.
**Jdawson**: We finally, finally, finally figured that out.
**Jdawson**: At least we think so.
**Jdawson**: And I'll show you on the drawing, but we've gonna have 28 new PIT charging stations.
**Jdawson**: 23 are going to be in the south wall.
**Jdawson**: I was specific on the chargers that we're looking at.
**Jdawson**: There are nine that are going to be 30amp feeds, 1420amp feeds.
**Jdawson**: You know, 24 volt versus 36 epoxy flooring.
**Jdawson**: We're going to provide the chargers, charger stands and batteries.
**Jdawson**: And then there's five new pit charging stations that are going to go along the demising wall.
**Jdawson**: It's not shown on the drawing I'll show you, but up by little sleepies next to the.
**Jdawson**: They have their own little charging area and we can, we can go through that.
**Jdawson**: But they're going to have two 30amp feeds and a.
**Jdawson**: And 320amp feed.
**Jdawson**: So let me just pull up the drawing.
**Bclymer**: Just kind of.
**Jdawson**: And I can kind of show you overall too, I guess.
**Jdawson**: But yeah, here's, here's a drawing.
**Jdawson**: So the 20.
**Jdawson**: So there's 28 total new charging stations.
**Jdawson**: They're all along the south wall here.
**Jdawson**: The 23.
**Jdawson**: These are existing.
**Jdawson**: I think there's 10?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, there's 10 that are existing in here, but then we're adding 23 more along this wall.
**Bclymer**: These and then these.
**Jdawson**: I tried to get them.
**Jdawson**: My engineers know, I tried to get them to Mark, but I'm, you know, bubble what they change with, you know, that's, you know, they're.
**Jdawson**: They're good people, but it's like.
**Jdawson**: So I mean, they just don't have time to do it, I guess.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: So Anyway, so there's 10 existing.
**Jdawson**: There's 10 existing.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: We're adding 23.
**Jdawson**: So there'll be 33 of us.
**Jdawson**: Well, let me just make sure.
**Jdawson**: So that's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
**Jdawson**: Those are new.
**Bclymer**: 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23.
**Jdawson**: So, yeah.
**Jdawson**: So those are all existing.
**Jdawson**: These right here.
**Jdawson**: I'm sorry, new.
**Jdawson**: These are existing.
**Jdawson**: You can tell by some of these.
**Jdawson**: The ones that have a little smaller unit on them are the existing rows.
**Bclymer**: So, yeah.
**Jdawson**: So 23 on this wall.
**Jdawson**: And then what drawing can I show you?
**Jdawson**: Oh, probably this will do.
**Jdawson**: I don't have a full drawing.
**Jdawson**: A little sleepy side yet.
**Jdawson**: So this.
**Bclymer**: Hold on.
**Jdawson**: So this is basically the.
**Jdawson**: The Amazon side.
**Jdawson**: It's not the whole building.
**Mparsons**: I have the.
**Mparsons**: The full drawing, by the way, in cad.
**Bclymer**: Can I see?
**Bclymer**: Come on.
**Kmass**: But the CAD files.
**Kmass**: The full building, Kevin.
**Mparsons**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: There we go.
**Jdawson**: So this is what it kind of looks like now.
**Jdawson**: The little sleepy side is this left side as we're looking at it.
**Jdawson**: These are those chargers that are existing.
**Jdawson**: And the five.
**Jdawson**: The five extra are going to go right there, you know, right here.
**Jdawson**: Because there is going to be.
**Jdawson**: This is going to be the racking.
**Jdawson**: I'm trying to get a full, like, full brand new.
**Jdawson**: Like, what is the final layout of this whole thing?
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Jdawson**: What is it supposed to look like when we're done?
**Jdawson**: But I know that until I get that, the five charges will be out of here.
**Jdawson**: So they'll.
**Jdawson**: They'll be coming from that west wall, switch gear.
**Jdawson**: So anyway, that's just to show you that.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So Those are the 28 new Chargers.
**Jdawson**: The workstations are mostly this, you know, same.
**Jdawson**: They did add a couple.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, a couple locations.
**Jdawson**: I'll show you a drawing.
**Jdawson**: Ones.
**Jdawson**: There's two.
**Jdawson**: Two locations.
**Jdawson**: Two more workstations that they're doing at the case sort area.
**Jdawson**: They couldn't put them on a drawing for me, but I will show you.
**Jdawson**: This is the case sort area.
**Jdawson**: And at the end of each of these conveyors, you can kind of see that Red line here.
**Jdawson**: I can blow it up.
**Jdawson**: Can I?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jdawson**: So in here these are workstations.
**Jdawson**: So a 20amp quad outlet drop there and a 20amp.
**Jdawson**: So basically we're adding two drops for the case sort area.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Jdawson**: All the rest of these stay the same.
**Jdawson**: Nothing has changed there.
**Jdawson**: And then the other change is back to my document.
**Bclymer**: This is.
**Jdawson**: They're driving crazy trying to keep up with this because I get.
**Jdawson**: They're making so many changes we can't get them on a drawing quick enough.
**Jdawson**: The other change is over on the little sleepy side again they want to know they're going to move some workstations there.
**Jdawson**: But it's just another 100, you know, one 20amp quad drop.
**Jdawson**: It's on a demising wall.
**Jdawson**: So it's, we can field verify but it's going to be up in this space here somewhere here just but for you know, layout and you know we should say final location.
**Jdawson**: I would say just you know, center it between what the racking shows and you know, the dock doors.
**Jdawson**: Somewhere on this we could put it, put the quad outlet, run it right down the wall and they'll, they'll just put the workstations wherever we put the outlet.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Jdawson**: So pretty straightforward there.
**Jdawson**: I just don't have a dot on the drawing yet, but it'll get there.
**Jdawson**: But I just wanted to put it in the scope.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so that's those two metal detectors.
**Jdawson**: Where are they showing them?
**Jdawson**: So we're actually putting in two new metal detectors at the existing security entrance because we're going to need more lanes for more people.
**Jdawson**: It's a 20amp quadrop.
**Jdawson**: It is, you can see in this.
**Bclymer**: Area.
**Jdawson**: Here'S where this is our existing security area.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Jdawson**: With the lockers as you come in, employee entrance.
**Jdawson**: They've added these two metal detectors.
**Jdawson**: We're obviously going to supply the metal detectors.
**Jdawson**: All they are is plug in.
**Jdawson**: I figured just drop, we'll have to drop it.
**Jdawson**: And then probably with the spacing, you know, pipe across the top to the, you know and conduit to the other side.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Put a box in a box just so they plug in up top.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Jdawson**: So but one, one drop from there.
**Bclymer**: To feed those two should.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, will definitely suffice.
**Bclymer**: So that's what else is.
**Jdawson**: What else did they add on me?
**Jdawson**: Command centers.
**Jdawson**: So you'll see them on the drawings.
**Jdawson**: But they don't.
**Jdawson**: I asked them well what are they doing there?
**Jdawson**: And they're like oh well they may have some TVs and, and the computer.
**Jdawson**: I said oh, that's Nice.
**Jdawson**: So someone else, they're.
**Jdawson**: I don't know how they're fabricating these.
**Jdawson**: I don't know if they're building them out of freaking tree and plywood or, or you know, Trex or.
**Jdawson**: I don't know what they're doing.
**Jdawson**: But we have someone building these platforms and they are located, you'll see them, they actually are on the print.
**Bclymer**: I just don't have.
**Jdawson**: You know, any.
**Bclymer**: Any.
**Jdawson**: Power shown at them.
**Jdawson**: But you'll see we blow it up.
**Bclymer**: Here a little bit.
**Bclymer**: You'll see there's four of them.
**Jdawson**: One of them's here.
**Jdawson**: There's basically two on the inbound, one of them's here.
**Jdawson**: So they're shown on the new print.
**Jdawson**: And then these are basically viewing platforms to see over the floor.
**Jdawson**: One, another one.
**Jdawson**: So there's four.
**Jdawson**: Two inbound, two outbound and what I.
**Jdawson**: And since they couldn't really give me any specs, I just said for now we got the four locations.
**Jdawson**: We're going to have two quad drops per location.
**Jdawson**: 220amp circuits, drop down detail.
**Jdawson**: You know, we're going to have to detail this out.
**Jdawson**: This is more for, hey, get it in the area.
**Jdawson**: We're going to drop it down.
**Jdawson**: But I need to see the platform, you know, because it's going to be in the middle, you know, with the drawing.
**Jdawson**: It's going to be in the middle.
**Jdawson**: I don't think it's going to be up against any columns or anything like that.
**Jdawson**: I'm pretty, you know, kind of sure about that maybe.
**Jdawson**: But wherever they put them, we're going to have to drop from the joist and then they're saying they're going to have some TV monitors.
**Jdawson**: Are they going to be hung?
**Jdawson**: You know, they don't give me any details.
**Jdawson**: So I just want to get power in the area and then obviously if there's a bit of detail to actually, you know, where the outlet's actually going and how we feeding the TVs and you know, that kind of stuff.
**Jdawson**: But I'm just, I'm just figuring a drop for now.
**Jdawson**: That's all I can do.
**Jdawson**: I said if you can't give me details and I'll just figure what I figure.
**Jdawson**: So that's on that.
**Jdawson**: So the, A little more details on that.
**Jdawson**: The yard power.
**Jdawson**: I, I only did this because I think I already told you the yard power.
**Jdawson**: We have the, the.
**Jdawson**: I sent you the cut sheets.
**Jdawson**: We have the location preferred location.
**Jdawson**: We have to define the exact location.
**Jdawson**: But it's now power to two charging units.
**Jdawson**: But both at the same location.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Which are between 144.
**Bclymer**: And receiving office stairs.
**Jdawson**: So that would be.
**Jdawson**: Oh, they're not shown on here because that's little cp.
**Bclymer**: So it would be on the other one here.
**Bclymer**: Come up for me.
**Jdawson**: So where they're again, we got a field verify outside, but There's Dock Door 144 and there's stairs here that go into the.
**Jdawson**: This is the receiving office area.
**Jdawson**: So somewhere in here they'd like, you know, behind the office, you know, because we're not using any of these dock doors, obviously.
**Bclymer**: Or positions, I should say.
**Jdawson**: They're not actually doors somewhere.
**Jdawson**: And I think the little sleepy gear is up here somewhere.
**Jdawson**: So Makes kind of sense.
**Jdawson**: So we just need to field verify where we can, you know, make sure there's not anything else out here obstructing where they'd want the chargers.
**Jdawson**: That's all.
**Jdawson**: But there's not really a real scope change other than that.
**Jdawson**: Well, they.
**Jdawson**: They clarified.
**Jdawson**: They only want two.
**Bclymer**: So both at 130, 480.
**Kmass**: Now both sit right next to each other.
**Kmass**: Right there.
**Jdawson**: Yep, yep.
**Bclymer**: Right next to each other.
**Jdawson**: And then the mcp.
**Jdawson**: Look, relocation.
**Jdawson**: I added that.
**Jdawson**: I don't.
**Jdawson**: I'm trying to think.
**Jdawson**: Do I have the exact.
**Jdawson**: Because it is a 60amp feed.
**Jdawson**: It is.
**Bclymer**: Which drawing do I want one.
**Jdawson**: This might be better.
**Jdawson**: So it is.
**Bclymer**: And I don't think it's necessarily.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, shown right here.
**Jdawson**: And I don't know if this has.
**Bclymer**: Gone over at all with the electrician when, you know, when Dean was on.
**Jdawson**: Site, but there's this MCP here is a 60amp feed.
**Jdawson**: It's being.
**Jdawson**: I don't have the timing exactly yet, but it's going to be.
**Jdawson**: And I'm assuming it's fed from over here somewhere.
**Jdawson**: It's going to be relocated to where?
**Jdawson**: She tell me.
**Jdawson**: She told me the location column B17.
**Jdawson**: So I don't think I have the.
**Bclymer**: Columns on here, do I?
**Kmass**: But it's going to be 17.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: B7.
**Jdawson**: Somewhere in here, I think.
**Jdawson**: I think there's around 17 is.
**Jdawson**: So it's going to be relocated from here to here.
**Jdawson**: So we have to obviously, you know, extend.
**Jdawson**: Extend the circuit or pull in a new one, whatever.
**Bclymer**: I don't know if it makes more.
**Jdawson**: Sense to pull it from over here, you know, abandon what's here.
**Jdawson**: I have no idea.
**Jdawson**: But whatever electrician thinks it's going to be moved.
**Bclymer**: And then we got to, you know.
**Jdawson**: The plan would be for us to pull whatever we can into the location because this Is, you know, this conveyance is being actively used.
**Jdawson**: So once they shut it down, they want to.
**Jdawson**: They want to be able to quickly reconnect it.
**Jdawson**: So this will be more coordination with our integrator, who's going to be, you know, pulling out the.
**Jdawson**: The MCP and the controls and all that and reinstalling it.
**Jdawson**: We'll want to at least have our power in the area.
**Jdawson**: You know, I don't want us to have to leave 100ft of slack, but we need to coordinate that so that we can then quickly, once they move and put it in place, we can re energize this control panel because these, you know, this is part of all this stuff is being moved over here.
**Bclymer**: So that's another piece I gotta to.
**Jdawson**: Nail down that part.
**Jdawson**: A little sleepy.
**Jdawson**: There'll be additional workstations to.
**Jdawson**: To power up, but we'll get that later.
**Jdawson**: So anyway, that's the MCP from there around here.
**Jdawson**: B17.
**Jdawson**: My best recollection without the column lines time is it 11:45.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Jdawson**: Any questions?
**Jdawson**: Sorry, Any questions?
**Kmass**: No, I think, I think we got that.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Conveyor power.
**Jdawson**: So there was.
**Jdawson**: It's deleted from.
**Jdawson**: I just wanted to make sure it was on a previous scope.
**Jdawson**: So we had.
**Jdawson**: I don't know where it was shown.
**Bclymer**: But I think gotta double click on it quick enough now.
**Bclymer**: There we go.
**Jdawson**: There were gonna be some power conveyors on each dock side.
**Jdawson**: They're now elevated, so they're gone.
**Jdawson**: And then we did have some pallet wrappers that I had included.
**Jdawson**: There wasn't a lot of scope.
**Jdawson**: They're now deleted.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Jdawson**: So no issues.
**Jdawson**: And then the only other two things I have and I don't.
**Jdawson**: You know, obviously this.
**Jdawson**: This involves little sleepies too, but there's part of it.
**Jdawson**: There's the demo for the Amazon piece, and then there's the reinstall for the little sleepies scope.
**Jdawson**: That will still have to define, but you know, obviously.
**Jdawson**: Which one do I want?
**Bclymer**: This one.
**Jdawson**: So when we.
**Bclymer**: Oh, doesn't show the racking.
**Jdawson**: Well, there is.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I'll use the other one just so it's easier to.
**Jdawson**: So all this racking in here is being moved, right?
**Jdawson**: Is going to be move over?
**Jdawson**: Well, I think.
**Jdawson**: Well, maybe not all of it, but we might sell some of it.
**Jdawson**: But the rack here is going to be removed.
**Jdawson**: It's going to be moved down to the little sleepy end of the building and re reinstalled.
**Jdawson**: So once that is done, we need to determine.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Jdawson**: You know, there's a lot of lighting in Here.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Based on the rack aisles.
**Jdawson**: So can we reuse any of the, you know, pull out some of this lighting to reuse in the rack and little sleepies.
**Jdawson**: I'm pointing over there.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So here it is.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So this he did put in the rack.
**Jdawson**: So they're going to recon, Reconfigure, sell off whatever they don't need, but put it over here.
**Jdawson**: Any of the.
**Jdawson**: Any lighting that we're going to need to improve, you know, for rack house here, we want to take out of here.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Jdawson**: The same thing with the exit signs at the end of the rows, we want to repurpose.
**Jdawson**: So that's the only reason I put that in the scope here is that we just.
**Jdawson**: We want to demo them, obviously.
**Jdawson**: But I don't want to, you know, destroy them.
**Jdawson**: I wanna.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I wanna make sure we save them and reuse them for a little sleepy.
**Jdawson**: So, I mean, that's sort of.
**Jdawson**: We won't know until.
**Kmass**: So if they have a row, A row of lights in every row of the rack.
**Kmass**: If we leave a row of lights for the Amazon space.
**Kmass**: Take out two rows of lights.
**Kmass**: Yeah, Leave a row.
**Kmass**: Take out two lever row.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I would think that would.
**Jdawson**: Because, I mean, this is what it's going to look like over there.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Jdawson**: So I mean.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I mean, it's going to be wide open.
**Jdawson**: I mean, it's not, you know, I.
**Jdawson**: I don't see it.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I just don't want it to be like these people may get burned with all that, you know, that dense lighting over there.
**Jdawson**: And it makes sense to reuse it for the new rack aisles for sleepy.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And obviously we won't need all those exit signs because we won't have any racking here.
**Jdawson**: So we might as well reuse those as well, which I think Dean put up anyway.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, so just wanted to make.
**Jdawson**: That's more of a note.
**Jdawson**: Obviously it's a cost, but, you know, some of the material you want to just coordinate that they're.
**Jdawson**: They're still working on it.
**Jdawson**: I'm going to be out there either Wednesday, Wednesday and Thursday or Thursday and Friday.
**Jdawson**: I'm still, still confirming which days.
**Jdawson**: I'll know by the, you know, by tomorrow.
**Jdawson**: But.
**Jdawson**: And I would like to kind of, you know, meet out there, make sure if there's any other questions that we get them answered because, you know, our folks are anxious to see things started.
**Jdawson**: So that's kind of where I'm at with this project is.
**Jdawson**: And I know they're still demoing a lot of the pieces that were in the geek area and the racking's still there, right?
**Jdawson**: So I know there's some things you can't do, but we.
**Jdawson**: I'd like to, you know, kind of understand, you know, hey, what.
**Jdawson**: Get the cost in for this, this scope that I'm talking about here, right?
**Jdawson**: What is the.
**Jdawson**: What is the real cost of this?
**Jdawson**: And then, you know what, you know, some of these things we can start doing now, right?
**Jdawson**: You know, some of.
**Jdawson**: Some of the areas that are clear.
**Jdawson**: So I'd like to get.
**Bclymer**: Understand the schedule as soon as possible.
**Jdawson**: Because I'm getting a lot of.
**Jdawson**: Not the dock doors.
**Jdawson**: I know the dock doors are, you know, a bit out.
**Jdawson**: We do want to get a schedule, obviously, but I told.
**Jdawson**: I've been telling them, look, guys, we need to order.
**Jdawson**: I said, you know, we can say six weeks, whatever, but until we place an order, right, we're not g.
**Jdawson**: You know, and.
**Jdawson**: And until filters through, it's.
**Jdawson**: We're not necessarily going to get the best dates.
**Kmass**: Can you.
**Kmass**: Can you send us an email to release us on ordering additional dock equipment?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I'll do that today as soon as I get the landlord's approval, which they're there.
**Jdawson**: We said we're giving you everything you want.
**Jdawson**: Just send us.
**Jdawson**: It's okay to order, right?
**Jdawson**: Because I don't want you to be on a hook or else be on the hook if someone, you know, some magical thing happens and they say we don't want them, right.
**Jdawson**: So I just want to cover both of our asses there.
**Jdawson**: So as soon as I have that, that's obviously on a.
**Jdawson**: On a different time frame.
**Jdawson**: All the electrical work right from pit charging, the workstations.
**Jdawson**: I want to get started like yesterday.
**Jdawson**: And I think Dean is out there and they know like we have.
**Jdawson**: I mean, this has to be operational.
**Jdawson**: The doors, no, but all the electrical work, that is at least in this initial scope, right.
**Jdawson**: I need that done by 7:21.
**Jdawson**: So that's what I need to schedule for.
**Jdawson**: That's why I put this.
**Jdawson**: This other stuff, little sleepies, you know, we'll get to some of this guard shack and this yard stuff.
**Jdawson**: I don't have any details, so I'm pulling that out.
**Jdawson**: Time clock we have.
**Jdawson**: We may have to.
**Jdawson**: We may have to get some power to time clocks by 7:21, but no one's giving me location, so.
**Jdawson**: And then this stuff, the temporary break room and restrooms, they're all over me.
**Jdawson**: And I told them, when do you need them?
**Jdawson**: Oh, we need them for peaks in September.
**Jdawson**: I Will.
**Jdawson**: I said, well, I'm not focusing on that.
**Jdawson**: So, I mean, they want everything to.
**Jdawson**: I said, guys, we.
**Jdawson**: We don't need to focus on this stuff yet.
**Jdawson**: So I'm trying to take out.
**Jdawson**: The only things I see that we may have to move up from a timeline perspective are these is stuff with guard shacks or time clocks.
**Jdawson**: But I.
**Jdawson**: I don't even know if we're going to need power or anything there, but.
**Jdawson**: And a few time clocks is not a big deal.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: So I'm not real concerned.
**Jdawson**: It's really.
**Jdawson**: I need to get.
**Jdawson**: I need to get all this, you know.
**Kmass**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: The relocation, the EV chargers, the command centers, blah, blah, blah.
**Bclymer**: And.
**Jdawson**: And the biggest piece obviously, for 721 is all these.
**Jdawson**: All the pit charging.
**Jdawson**: I think the drops.
**Jdawson**: You know, there's 100 and some drops, but I think that's fairly straightforward.
**Jdawson**: Not.
**Jdawson**: Not huge.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: But this is where we have, you know, bit to do.
**Jdawson**: So anyway, just.
**Kmass**: Just to clarify on the.
**Kmass**: Sorry, the.
**Kmass**: Like the landlord.
**Kmass**: Excuse me.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Get all choked up on me, Jesse.
**Kmass**: I am making me cry here.
**Kmass**: The landlord has approved everything but the bumpers or the.
**Jdawson**: I.
**Jdawson**: What I saw from Paula, who's our real estate person, and she.
**Jdawson**: I try not to get involved directly with the landlords because it, you know, that's her.
**Jdawson**: That's her lane.
**Jdawson**: So she sent the whole package back and said, including the Fairborn that you guys sent us and said, this is what we're giving you.
**Jdawson**: We're giving everything you wanted.
**Jdawson**: Boom.
**Jdawson**: Give us.
**Jdawson**: Give us.
**Jdawson**: And that was yesterday evening.
**Jdawson**: So she's gonna press them today.
**Jdawson**: I have the email ready to go to you to say fire off, order quantity, you know, you know, 60, you know, you know, 30 new doctors, 20 more doc locks, 20 more fans, 21 more fans up.
**Jdawson**: I'm ready to do that as soon as the landlord gives me something in.
**Bclymer**: Writing so I don't get screwed.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Kmass**: Excellent.
**Kmass**: Sounds good.
**Jdawson**: So, yeah, so I think we're good.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So just on this one there, I got.
**Jdawson**: This is our highest profile project.
**Jdawson**: Obviously, Amex is important, but less work, a little more time to actually get operational.
**Jdawson**: So that's, you know, just so you know, Dean.
**Kmass**: Dean's committed to getting this done for your schedule, so we're gonna make it happen.
**Jdawson**: Oh, I keep saying that and I have faith.
**Jdawson**: I just need at some point here in the near future, like cost and an actual, at least tentative schedule.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Of when you're going to be there.
**Jdawson**: Because what's.
**Jdawson**: Here's what's.
**Jdawson**: Happening.
**Jdawson**: So I've been asked to be out there, like, for the next six weeks from Monday through Thursday, which to me is overkill.
**Jdawson**: But.
**Jdawson**: And I don't really.
**Jdawson**: I don't think I can because I got other stuff to do, like a life.
**Jdawson**: But unless you have room in your house.
**Jdawson**: Jesse, you live in India.
**Jdawson**: Can I come?
**Jdawson**: You don't live in Indy, right?
**Jdawson**: Well, Brandon has a place.
**Kmass**: Brandon?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Kmass**: Dr.
**Kmass**: Brandon.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: But no.
**Jdawson**: Anyway, so I'm gonna be in India a lot, and every day I'm there, they're gonna be like, what's happening with electrical?
**Jdawson**: What's happening with electrical?
**Jdawson**: So, yeah, a lot of pressure is going to be on Dean and myself.
**Jdawson**: You know, I'm basically going to be on site watching Dean's guys work.
**Kmass**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So, yeah, they need to get me, like, I need.
**Jdawson**: They need to come out next week at some point.
**Jdawson**: Like I said, I'm going to be out, you know, Wednesday, Thursday, Thursday, Friday, some couple days next week.
**Jdawson**: But they need to tell me what they're going to start doing next week.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: I need.
**Jdawson**: We're going to need to.
**Jdawson**: And we could coordinate week to week what they plan on doing, how many people.
**Jdawson**: I mean, I even have to register.
**Jdawson**: You know, I had to put in a.
**Jdawson**: You know, when am I going to be out there?
**Jdawson**: What am I having vendors or contractors out there?
**Jdawson**: I mean, this is being picked over like we were, you know, you know, building a government.
**Jdawson**: You know, this was a government project or something, like some kind of defense contract.
**Jdawson**: So it's crazy.
**Jdawson**: And I got everybody up my ass.
**Bclymer**: And so we'll put together a schedule.
**Kmass**: We'Ll get with Dean and.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I just want you to relay to them, like, this is.
**Jdawson**: I have faith, but I need, like, I need something I can share to say, hey, each week Dean's gonna have two guys.
**Jdawson**: And God knows, I know it changes depending on what you have access to.
**Jdawson**: So none of these people know what you're actually doing.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: We have to get it done.
**Jdawson**: I just need a preliminary plan.
**Jdawson**: They're free to change it, you know, as we discuss it, but I just need.
**Jdawson**: I need them out there next week doing something, and they need to tell me what they're gonna do right before.
**Jdawson**: And I know you don't have permit plans, but with the electrical.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Kmass**: They can do a lot.
**Kmass**: They can do a lot inspection.
**Kmass**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: So that's what I'm backing on.
**Jdawson**: So anyway, okay.
**Jdawson**: Just emphasizing then I will have.
**Jdawson**: Just.
**Jdawson**: We won't probably.
**Jdawson**: We could probably talk next week.
**Jdawson**: I Have a little bit of work for deem to do over at our Brownsburg site.
**Jdawson**: Indy One, we're doing.
**Jdawson**: We're adding in some robotics, so there'll be some charters to feed.
**Jdawson**: And, you know, it's.
**Jdawson**: It's a minor project.
**Jdawson**: I got.
**Jdawson**: I got to get a drawing yet, but I'll send it to you.
**Jdawson**: But it's mainly electrical.
**Jdawson**: It's really nothing.
**Jdawson**: I mean, but I just.
**Jdawson**: I'm trying to keep this.
**Jdawson**: You know, I want to just keep it going through you guys, so.
**Jdawson**: Because I don't.
**Jdawson**: I don't have anybody to manage this stuff, like, on site.
**Jdawson**: And so I told our folks, like, look, we.
**Jdawson**: We're going to pay for management of this, so we.
**Jdawson**: You know, I'm.
**Jdawson**: Because I don't.
**Jdawson**: I can't.
**Jdawson**: I'm going to be so focused on this Amazon that, you know, I just need to make sure whatever's happening with Indy One Brownsburg is just getting done.
**Jdawson**: So I'll get you a drawing and a timeline and a scope on that.
**Jdawson**: But again, it'll be mostly electrical and pretty minimal, I think.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Kmass**: You want us to have a guy over there on site to manage that?
**Kmass**: That one?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I mean, whatever you wanted.
**Jdawson**: I mean, whatever you think.
**Jdawson**: I mean, it's.
**Jdawson**: You don't have to be on set.
**Jdawson**: You know, it's very.
**Jdawson**: But I mean, I'm just going to go through you and you guys, you know, I'll pay you a little bit of markup just to manage Dean there, just because, you know, I don't want to get into going directly to Dean.
**Bclymer**: And doing all that stuff, so.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: You know what I mean?
**Jdawson**: Because it's.
**Jdawson**: It's really a minor thing, so I'll work it out with Brandon.
**Jdawson**: Say, look, you got to cut me a break on your rate on this one.
**Jdawson**: You're gonna have to do next to nothing, and.
**Jdawson**: And it's not gonna make any money.
**Jdawson**: You're not gonna make any money anyway.
**Jdawson**: It's just a little bit.
**Jdawson**: It's just a little bit electrical.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Kmass**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: But anyway, I just want to, you know, keep.
**Jdawson**: I'm just gonna keep throwing it to you guys.
**Jdawson**: I know.
**Jdawson**: First of all, you're local.
**Jdawson**: You'll do a good job.
**Jdawson**: You'll get it done.
**Jdawson**: And I don't want to.
**Jdawson**: I keep telling our folks, like, you know, the.
**Jdawson**: Knowing the.
**Jdawson**: You know, the folks that you can trust that can do the job versus I don't.
**Jdawson**: You know, normally that in Brownsburg, we probably.
**Jdawson**: If we had a local electrician, we probably would have just thrown it to them.
**Jdawson**: But I don't have any of those contacts anymore because we got rid of all our maintenance guys.
**Mparsons**: So.
**Jdawson**: Anyway, I'm just doing it my way.
**Jdawson**: So I'll send you that okay next week.
**Jdawson**: But, yeah, let's.
**Jdawson**: Let's move on.
**Jdawson**: Main things are Amex, get the cost on that, that second optional fencing.
**Jdawson**: And then obviously for Amazon getting the cost and schedule for Dean to get out there next week.
**Kmass**: You got it.
**Jdawson**: All right, guys, if you have any questions, I'll be around.
**Bclymer**: Appreciate it.
**Kmass**: All right.
**Kmass**: Appreciate it.
**Bclymer**: Bye.
