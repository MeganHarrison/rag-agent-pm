## Transcript
**Dmiles**: Hey.
**Lhoran**: Good afternoon, everyone.
**Dmiles**: Hey there.
**Dmiles**: Good afternoon.
**Dmiles**: AJ will be here in two minutes.
**Dmiles**: Okay.
**Dmiles**: Sa.
**Ahuettl**: Hey, guys.
**Ahuettl**: Sorry I'm a little late.
**Lydia**: Hey, AJ.
**Ahuettl**: Everybody hear me okay?
**Dmiles**: Yep.
**Lydia**: Sure can.
**Ahuettl**: Okay, well, I'll just go ahead and get going.
**Ahuettl**: It looks like.
**Dmiles**: Yep.
**Ahuettl**: Emma and Lydia are here.
**Ahuettl**: Dan, it's just you from the applied side today, correct?
**Dmiles**: Yes, sir.
**Ahuettl**: Okay, well, drywall finishers there.
**Ahuettl**: And we're.
**Dmiles**: We're.
**Ahuettl**: We're rocking and rolling with everything.
**Ahuettl**: We did actually have an inspector stop by last week, which is.
**Ahuettl**: You never know with these ti finishes.
**Ahuettl**: And we passed our inspection, so we started boarding on Wednesday, and that's that.
**Ahuettl**: Dan, from a submittal standpoint with.
**Ahuettl**: With VAVs, Mark sent a couple responses back.
**Ahuettl**: We had a question on them once we get that RFI closed out, which I'm not sure if.
**Ahuettl**: Alex, he responded to you or not.
**Ahuettl**: I haven't looked yet.
**Ahuettl**: But we'll.
**Ahuettl**: We'll send out the schedule on when we want to get those replaced.
**Ahuettl**: They're about a week and a half to two weeks out.
**Ahuettl**: And so we're looking here.
**Ahuettl**: Probably middle of August to start, Dan.
**Ahuettl**: But it's on my radar.
**Ahuettl**: I know you've been waiting for a schedule, so just give me a couple days here and I'll be able to get that to you.
**Dmiles**: Sure.
**Dmiles**: That's.
**Lydia**: That sounds good.
**Dmiles**: Yep.
**Lhoran**: And then for the only vav that there remains a question on is the 50amp one I just got.
**Lhoran**: I gotta give it.
**Lhoran**: Dan, we gotta go searching for some panel space.
**Lhoran**: If there's some available, then great.
**Lhoran**: If not, we'll have to come up with a solution.
**Dmiles**: Yeah.
**Lhoran**: Splitting that in two.
**Lydia**: Yeah, he sent me a note on that today.
**Lydia**: Said can you ask the EC checking on either a 480 volt 3 phase circuit or 2083 phase circuit for the 14kW VAV box.
**Lydia**: It must be what he's talking about then.
**Dmiles**: Yep.
**Dmiles**: Yep.
**Lhoran**: It's the one over near the conference room.
**Lydia**: But I'm trying to get feedback.
**Dmiles**: Our.
**Lydia**: One of our electrical engineers did a little walking around with Mark today and.
**Lydia**: And they followed up and said from what we can see in our panel boards there by our restrooms, that electrical closet, there would be capability for either.
**Lydia**: But not sure which one you were pulling from.
**Lydia**: So you might get again with Mark when you get here because we might have identified that for you.
**Dmiles**: Okay.
**Lhoran**: Awesome.
**Dmiles**: Yeah.
**Ahuettl**: My only.
**Ahuettl**: There's a.
**Ahuettl**: There's another electrical room, Alex, in the hallway that's closer to that vav.
**Dmiles**: Yeah, I believe.
**Dmiles**: Yeah.
**Ahuettl**: If we can pull.
**Ahuettl**: I would Rather pull from that because that's a pretty long run going from those bathrooms to the new one.
**Ahuettl**: So if we can avoid that, it's gonna be some big wire.
**Dmiles**: Yeah, yeah.
**Lydia**: Let us.
**Ahuettl**: I'd like to try to do that.
**Lydia**: We just think we.
**Lydia**: We might have you covered though, just in case, so.
**Ahuettl**: Awesome.
**Dmiles**: Yeah.
**Ahuettl**: We're getting Dan out there to start their overhead.
**Ahuettl**: I owe an updated wafer submittal on the lighting to Mark.
**Ahuettl**: Other than that we are.
**Dmiles**: We're rolling.
**Ahuettl**: Casework is supposed to go in that first week.
**Ahuettl**: That'll be one of the last things we do.
**Ahuettl**: We're looking late August, early September there.
**Ahuettl**: So there's going to be some coordination involved with ripping down that wall Dan and starting to tie in the finishes.
**Dmiles**: Yeah.
**Ahuettl**: Me and Alex got to put our heads together just to make sure we're ready for that.
**Ahuettl**: The hardest part is that ceiling walking.
**Ahuettl**: I was there Friday walking it with my ceiling guys.
**Ahuettl**: And we may to get our layout right, have to tear down a portion of the top of that wall to make sure we're tying in correctly.
**Ahuettl**: So stay tuned on what we figure out.
**Ahuettl**: My goal all along has been leave that up as long as possible because I don't want to have to put plastic up.
**Ahuettl**: It's going to be loud and annoying for the next six weeks to have just a plastic wall there.
**Dmiles**: Thank you.
**Ahuettl**: That's what we're working on figuring out.
**Ahuettl**: You know, I can leave like a.
**Ahuettl**: An eight foot wall there and then plastic above.
**Ahuettl**: I'd be okay with that.
**Ahuettl**: I'm just more worried about the noise and so yeah, we'll.
**Ahuettl**: We'll get an answer to you here in the next couple days on what.
**Ahuettl**: What we're gonna have to do.
**Dmiles**: Okay.
**Lydia**: And then do you see Mark's email about the remote balancing dampers for a couple that diffusers in the lobby?
**Ahuettl**: Yes.
**Lydia**: He found a kind of a remotely operated damper so that we can adjust those two diffusers.
**Lydia**: We just can't get to there for the hard rock.
**Lydia**: You know, Sheetrock ceiling won't be able to get to the dampers that are currently installed.
**Lydia**: So without this remote operator.
**Dmiles**: Yep, yep.
**Lhoran**: And I've already talked to Swifter about that a little bit.
**Lhoran**: A.J.
**Ahuettl**: Okay.
**Ahuettl**: Would you.
**Ahuettl**: Would you.
**Ahuettl**: I mean it's a pretty, pretty good sized hard lid on our plans.
**Ahuettl**: It doesn't call for any access panel.
**Ahuettl**: Do you want us to put a discrete access panel somewhere or what?
**Ahuettl**: We can do that and make it look pretty.
**Ahuettl**: I don't know if parallel.
**Ahuettl**: If you have any weigh in on that.
**Bclymer**: If, depending on the size requirements, we can give some input on maybe best what we see as design intent location.
**Bclymer**: But if you give us the size of what you're wanting to install, we can.
**Dmiles**: We can look at it and we're.
**Lydia**: Hoping to avoid that, A.J.
**Lydia**: that's why we kind of came up with the remote idea.
**Lydia**: They, you know, they can come through the diffuser to grab the chains and you know, it might be a little distance, but so.
**Lydia**: Or a light that's not installed, you know.
**Dmiles**: Yep.
**Lydia**: So we're hoping to avoid it, but let's start there and.
**Ahuettl**: No, that sounds like a great solution.
**Ahuettl**: I just wanted to throw it out there if.
**Ahuettl**: If we could.
**Lydia**: So.
**Dmiles**: Yeah.
**Dmiles**: Okay.
**Ahuettl**: Alleato.
**Ahuettl**: Do you guys have anything.
**Ahuettl**: Any questions for me or Alex?
**Bclymer**: No.
**Bclymer**: Do you have all the submittal requests?
**Bclymer**: I'm.
**Bclymer**: I checked with Emma before a call and she said we've responded to everything, so unless you need anything from us, we should be good.
**Ahuettl**: No, the only thing I think I was tracking on is maybe some drawdowns.
**Ahuettl**: I got your comments back.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Ahuettl**: And we've released case.
**Dmiles**: We.
**Ahuettl**: We've released casework.
**Ahuettl**: Saw the comments on the flooring, so we'll.
**Ahuettl**: We'll get with applied on.
**Ahuettl**: On Dr.
**Ahuettl**: Trying to best match what's there.
**Bclymer**: Which I know we talked about a little bit last week.
**Bclymer**: So if we need to come up with a creative solution for that, if existing isn't available or whatever that looks like, just let us know and we can help.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah, it's priority one right now, so.
**Dmiles**: Okay.
**Ahuettl**: We need to get it ordered.
**Lhoran**: I spoke to our flooring guys.
**Lhoran**: He's gonna get some sample books and go by and check it out and try to try to find something that matches.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, And I hate to put it.
**Bclymer**: Hate to put it on them, but just because we don't have record drawings and you know, we have books in our library, but nothing that matches exactly.
**Bclymer**: I just.
**Bclymer**: We can't pinpoint what that product is, so.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, we'll appreciate their help.
**Dmiles**: Okay.
**Dmiles**: Okay.
**Ahuettl**: Dan, any more questions for us?
**Lydia**: No, not that I can think of.
**Lydia**: Thanks for keeping an eye out on the schedule for, you know, the replacement existing terminal boxes.
**Lydia**: I'm definitely going to probably have people work at home that might be under them, so just little heads up there.
**Lydia**: And then if I need to take out that group that's by the wall, I can ask them to work from home when you do the tear down.
**Lydia**: Yeah, we're trying to keep you on normal working hours, so I'm just going to have people work from home.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah, no I really appreciate that.
**Ahuettl**: It's.
**Ahuettl**: It's something we.
**Ahuettl**: We want to get figured out this week.
**Ahuettl**: Like what that's going to look like.
**Ahuettl**: I wasn't thinking that.
**Ahuettl**: That transom or I don't know what kind kind of call what you call that edging on that feeling we're putting in Axiom.
**Ahuettl**: That's what it is.
**Ahuettl**: It's gonna.
**Ahuettl**: It's gonna be difficult to try and tie that in and get our math perfect to keep that continuous.
**Ahuettl**: So we'll put our heads together and figure out what.
**Ahuettl**: What the best way is to do it and try and be as non invasive as possible.
**Lydia**: Excellent.
**Lydia**: And then when Dan comes in, if, you know, you want even assistance from our engineer on the one in the hallway, we can join him for that conversation if you need us.
**Lhoran**: Okay, that'd be great.
**Lhoran**: As soon as I get them back in there, I'll investigate and come to you if I have any questions.
**Lydia**: Okay, Sounds good.
**Ahuettl**: Awesome, guys.
**Ahuettl**: That's all I have.
**Dmiles**: Thank you.
**Lydia**: AJ it looks good in there.
**Lydia**: I went by right before the meeting and yeah, all the walls up.
**Lydia**: You can really get a sense of the space now.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah, yeah, it's a.
**Ahuettl**: It's bigger once the walls go up.
**Ahuettl**: In this case, at least it was to me.
**Lydia**: Yeah, it's going to be great.
**Lydia**: We're excited.
**Ahuettl**: Awesome.
**Ahuettl**: Alrighty, guys, have a good one.
**Bclymer**: Thanks, everyone.
**Dmiles**: Thank you.
**Dmiles**: Bye.
