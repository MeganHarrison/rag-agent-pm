**Bclymer**: Good morning.
**Fnjie**: Hi, Brianna.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: Yes, now I can hear you, Jose.
**Fnjie**: That's good.
**Fnjie**: I think it was a headset.
**Fnjie**: It's okay.
**Jmendez**: Yeah, yeah, headset.
**Fnjie**: All right.
**Fnjie**: So, Angela, so everything is good for this Friday.
**Fnjie**: So I know you're running.
**Fnjie**: Running payroll today.
**Brianna.isenberg**: Correct that.
**Jmendez**: Today, tomorrow, Whenever you're ready.
**Jmendez**: Yeah, whenever you're ready.
**Fnjie**: So, Fritzi, is everything good in terms of the timesheets?
**Fnjie**: In the timesheet, we're going to have the per team and the meal allowance.
**Fnjie**: And so actually they were asking we had a truck allowance to each of the employees, which is 500 monthly.
**Fnjie**: So we can set up with you.
**Fnjie**: Right, Angela?
**Fnjie**: Like to have it already set up to each of.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Brianna.isenberg**: See if we can have it.
**Jmendez**: Yes.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: Truck allowance can be added as well.
**Fnjie**: And then what else do we need to add?
**Fnjie**: Nothing else from the time sheets.
**Jmendez**: So I believe the truck allowance is set up.
**Jmendez**: Unless we're missing someone.
**Jmendez**: Let me see.
**Jmendez**: Who doesn't have one.
**Fnjie**: Maybe new employees or something set up.
**Jmendez**: Let's see.
**Jmendez**: Who's this?
**Jmendez**: Jack.
**Fnjie**: Looks like.
**Jmendez**: Jack.
**Jmendez**: Curtain.
**Fnjie**: He has it.
**Jmendez**: He does not.
**Fnjie**: Okay, so he needs it too.
**Jmendez**: He needs the allowance.
**Jmendez**: Okay, so we'll do one auto allowance.
**Fnjie**: Let me show you right now, this week.
**Fnjie**: Yes, one second.
**Brianna.isenberg**: Let me go ahead and check that right now.
**Fnjie**: Because they have the offer letter.
**Fnjie**: So I can check if they actually.
**Fnjie**: Yes, let me go here pretty quick.
**Fnjie**: So this is Jack Horton.
**Fnjie**: So this is.
**Brianna.isenberg**: One second.
**Brianna.isenberg**: Activate list Curtain Jack.
**Fnjie**: So in his offer letter here.
**Brianna.isenberg**: So let me go ahead and check that.
**Fnjie**: Yes, yes, he does have a month allowance card.
**Fnjie**: Yeah.
**Fnjie**: So he has 70amonth fund allowance, 500amonth card allowance.
**Jmendez**: And normally this is deduction period one.
**Jmendez**: Right.
**Jmendez**: It's usually the First.
**Jmendez**: The first of the month, I believe.
**Jmendez**: Okay, so his is saved.
**Jmendez**: Let me see who else does not have one.
**Fnjie**: Yes, let's check that they have a truck allowance franchise.
**Fnjie**: Did we get any people from meal allowances this 15 days?
**Fnjie**: These weeks?
**Rita.philip**: I sent you the file.
**Rita.philip**: I just forwarded it to you.
**Rita.philip**: It was already approved by Brandon.
**Fnjie**: Oh, perfect.
**Fnjie**: So here is.
**Fnjie**: Oh, perfect.
**Fnjie**: So I'm going to send this to you right now, Angela, so we can have it additional payroll items.
**Fnjie**: So all good with timesheets, Fritzi?
**Fnjie**: Everything good.
**Fnjie**: I know we're working on a notion setup, but that's different between you and me.
**Fnjie**: But everything, it's good, right?
**Brianna.isenberg**: In terms of timesheets.
**Fnjie**: Okay, so let me send this to you.
**Rita.philip**: What else do we need in timesheet?
**Rita.philip**: I think only the per dime per diem.
**Rita.philip**: Right.
**Rita.philip**: Since they are entering it, if there is also a pto.
**Brianna.isenberg**: Is that correct?
**Fnjie**: Yes, but I think someone has pto.
**Jmendez**: There are eight hours of leave requested and they're only zero hours.
**Jmendez**: So who is this for?
**Jmendez**: There's a PTO request in the system for Austin.
**Jmendez**: Austin Taylor.
**Fnjie**: Yes.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Jmendez**: For eight hours.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Rita.philip**: So no need to provide since they are applying it in the system.
**Jmendez**: So is PTO ready to roll?
**Jmendez**: Brianna for them?
**Jmendez**: I'm getting an error message that there's no available pto, so I can't approve it.
**Bclymer**: Let me take a look and see what's in here.
**Jmendez**: And while she's checking that Maria, Megan is the other one that didn't have the allowance.
**Jmendez**: The truck allowance.
**Fnjie**: It's okay.
**Fnjie**: Megan doesn't need it.
**Fnjie**: She's actually working with us, but kind of like, you know, back and forth.
**Fnjie**: That's okay.
**Fnjie**: It's okay.
**Jmendez**: Everybody else seems to have it.
**Fnjie**: Okay, perfect.
**Jmendez**: So check auto.
**Jmendez**: It's auto set for the first pay of every period.
**Jmendez**: So.
**Jmendez**: So that's gonna go.
**Fnjie**: So yeah.
**Fnjie**: So Austin.
**Fnjie**: So Taylor, he required PTO for.
**Fnjie**: Yeah, for some days.
**Fnjie**: And you said eight hours of pto.
**Fnjie**: Okay, perfect.
**Bclymer**: It looks like PTO is accruing.
**Bclymer**: And then.
**Accounting**: Austin, let's make sure then please attach to the plan.
**Brianna.isenberg**: He said it to the wrong person.
**Brianna.isenberg**: One second.
**Brianna.isenberg**: This is.
**Bclymer**: Yes, he is.
**Bclymer**: And it looks like he does have 18.48 hours available.
**Bclymer**: So I don't know why the system isn't communicating saying that.
**Accounting**: Well, who is the employee?
**Bclymer**: It's Austin Taylor.
**Accounting**: And how many hours is he supposed to have?
**Bclymer**: 18 points.
**Accounting**: No, that he wants to use.
**Jmendez**: He wants to use eight.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Accounting**: It looks like on his last voucher he used 24.
**Accounting**: So he has 1848 available 308 is what he gets every check.
**Jmendez**: I think with his.
**Jmendez**: I think what happened with this one is that.
**Jmendez**: Well, no, it's individual.
**Jmendez**: I, I'm not sure.
**Jmendez**: I think what he did was loop lumped his together like he, he and it overlapped pay periods.
**Jmendez**: It overlapped.
**Jmendez**: So he put in for a lump sum of PTO of 32 hours or something like that.
**Jmendez**: But it included two pay periods.
**Accounting**: So 24 last week and eight this week.
**Jmendez**: Yeah, but when he put it in, I think he just lumped it in as 32 hours versus I need 19th, 20th, you know one like requesting eight hours for the 20th.
**Jmendez**: He lumped it all together.
**Jmendez**: So.
**Accounting**: So it's saying is the error that you're getting that he doesn't have it available.
**Accounting**: Correct.
**Jmendez**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: So he, they're trying to pull.
**Accounting**: I get it now.
**Accounting**: So they're trying to pull that again that 32 hour whatever he requested instead of him requesting eight.
**Accounting**: So can we fix that to reflect eight or does that have to be an adjustment by PTO team?
**Accounting**: Because that's going to reflect his, his.
**Jmendez**: Yeah.
**Jmendez**: The issue is that it, it's a stoppage for us.
**Jmendez**: Like we cannot proceed when that happens.
**Jmendez**: It.
**Jmendez**: So it, we may need to delete it.
**Jmendez**: Clear it.
**Jmendez**: I mean Mark, I think this may be a.
**Jmendez**: Let me look, let me just look at something real quick.
**Jmendez**: Let me look at.
**Jmendez**: All right, so.
**Jmendez**: Okay, so Taylor, I might need to mark it paid.
**Jmendez**: I may need to mark it paid and then manually put it in.
**Accounting**: So we can't just delete the entry.
**Jmendez**: Right now and over because it's lumped together.
**Jmendez**: It's lumped together.
**Jmendez**: It's 32 hours.
**Jmendez**: The request was for 32 lump sum hours from period 319 through 324.
**Jmendez**: And so it, that covered two pay periods.
**Jmendez**: So it's, it's just we.
**Jmendez**: Some of it is accounted for and some of it is not.
**Jmendez**: So it's, it's just in these.
**Jmendez**: When PTO is requested.
**Jmendez**: Let's going forward, when PTO is requested, try to encourage employees to put it in by the day instead.
**Jmendez**: And this is just to Maria and Fatima and whoever's working with pto, just encourage employees to do it by the day because in this situation it carried over into a new pay period and it just, it causes some system errors.
**Jmendez**: That's all.
**Jmendez**: Try to do a workaround with it and it, it still will be accounted for.
**Jmendez**: But right now it's, it's, it's blocking me from even approving it.
**Accounting**: 32 hours.
**Jmendez**: All right.
**Jmendez**: So I'm going to try to go in and approve it.
**Jmendez**: And I can't separate it because it was requested as a lump sum.
**Jmendez**: When it's requested by the day, it just kind of goes in on that particular pay period.
**Fnjie**: Do you want me to tell Justin, can he do something on his side?
**Jmendez**: No, we can do it on our end.
**Jmendez**: I just don't want anybody to panic because it's.
**Jmendez**: It's gonna, it's gonna look like it's been paid already and it's not, it's not really paid.
**Jmendez**: I can't put it back in pending because it.
**Jmendez**: Regardless of the fact it's lump sum, I can cancel it, which doesn't hurt anything.
**Jmendez**: It doesn't hurt anything.
**Jmendez**: On.
**Jmendez**: On you're in.
**Fnjie**: I mean, yeah, if we need to cancel, I can explain Justin the problem too.
**Fnjie**: I mean, whatever works for you guys also.
**Accounting**: Okay, so I'm getting confused.
**Accounting**: So that 24 hours that he took on 321.
**Accounting**: That should have been 32 or that's.
**Jmendez**: Included in it should be 24.
**Jmendez**: That that is actually correct.
**Jmendez**: But I believe we had the ERA on the previous payroll and we couldn't move forward.
**Jmendez**: So we ended up just manually doing it.
**Accounting**: I got it.
**Jmendez**: We had to just.
**Jmendez**: We had to remove it.
**Jmendez**: We just had to remove it.
**Accounting**: So he was already paid basically for his request that he's trying to do today.
**Jmendez**: Only for 24 hours.
**Jmendez**: Only for 24 hours.
**Jmendez**: It is.
**Jmendez**: It's a system thing.
**Jmendez**: Whenever.
**Jmendez**: That's why I on the front end, I try to encourage people to do their PTO as each is do it as an eight hour day versus a lump sum span that includes weekends and whatever else.
**Jmendez**: Because if anything comes up, we can't remove it.
**Jmendez**: It's in there as a lump sum.
**Jmendez**: The request was done as a lump sum.
**Jmendez**: It's so much easier to fix when PTO is entered by the day.
**Jmendez**: So you know you're going to be a week off.
**Jmendez**: Instead of requesting a 40 hour lump sum, you request Monday as 8 hours.
**Jmendez**: Tuesday is 8 hours, Wednesday is 8 hours.
**Jmendez**: If you decide not to take it, it's just easy to go in and cancel Wednesday because, you know, I decided to come in Wednesday.
**Jmendez**: But when it's lumped together, the entire PTO has to be removed and re entered.
**Jmendez**: That's the downfall of requesting PTO as a lump sum.
**Jmendez**: 40 hours in prison.
**Bclymer**: So Angela, would you like me to put in a case to PTO as a payroll stoppage for them to go in and fix it or.
**Jmendez**: Yes.
**Jmendez**: On the grounds that 24 of those hours have already been done.
**Jmendez**: Or I can just cancel it.
**Jmendez**: I can just cancel the entire request.
**Accounting**: What is his original request?
**Accounting**: What does he want?
**Accounting**: 40 hours?
**Jmendez**: 32.
**Accounting**: So he still needs to be paid a PTO time.
**Fnjie**: Basically I'm actually texting him just to make sure what was the amount and everything just so we don't have was.
**Jmendez**: On their last pay period and we got an error.
**Jmendez**: Yeah, we got an error.
**Accounting**: Then could we run a separate check just for PTO for him for 8 hours, cancel it out and then just so he gets another.
**Jmendez**: No, I don't recommend it.
**Jmendez**: That involves a manual batch.
**Jmendez**: This is part of a regular.
**Jmendez**: He's not owed it like he's.
**Jmendez**: He's not scheduled to receive the additional eight hours until this week.
**Jmendez**: So it's not like you know, you know we didn't pay him or anything like that.
**Jmendez**: He was paid the 24 hours last time and now he has eight more hours that he has a request for that we need to pay.
**Jmendez**: I mean it's, it's.
**Jmendez**: I guess if I cancel it.
**Jmendez**: We just need to know the, the you know the downfall is that he's.
**Jmendez**: He's going to get a cancellation email saying that your PTO was cancelled when actuality we're just man entering it so.
**Accounting**: And then his balance then at that point would only be 10 hours and 48.
**Accounting**: If we take out the eight.
**Jmendez**: It's not gonna.
**Jmendez**: It's not canceling the.
**Jmendez**: The request is not won't.
**Jmendez**: It's not going to do anything to his balance.
**Jmendez**: We.
**Jmendez**: We would have to manually go.
**Accounting**: Yeah, no, no, I understand but just to make it we'll have to do a case to adjust it that eight hours needs to be pulled.
**Jmendez**: Yeah, it just gives it back to him.
**Jmendez**: It gives the eight hours back to him in the cancellation and then we add it manually for him and then it's.
**Jmendez**: It's a wash.
**Jmendez**: It's essentially it's a wash.
**Accounting**: Right.
**Accounting**: Negative and a positive.
**Jmendez**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: But then we'll just do a ticket Brianna to have it make sure.
**Jmendez**: That'S all everything accounting for.
**Jmendez**: And I will wait till after the pay period to do that.
**Accounting**: When is the check?
**Accounting**: When is it this check date?
**Accounting**: Friday?
**Jmendez**: Yes.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: So Angela, do you want me to tell maybe Austin that is gonna get canceled but then you guys going to manually.
**Jmendez**: He just doesn't need to panic when he sees a cancellation come through and he knows he's already.
**Fnjie**: He.
**Jmendez**: I don't want.
**Jmendez**: I don't want to create any type of confusion because he may Say I've already been paid for 24 hours.
**Jmendez**: You know, there's.
**Jmendez**: It's going to spark some questions.
**Jmendez**: So as long as he knows that.
**Jmendez**: Don't worry, we, you know, we're gonna.
**Jmendez**: Your eight hours is being manually put in.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Jmendez**: I just did it.
**Jmendez**: I just did it.
**Jmendez**: So we're fine.
**Fnjie**: Perfect.
**Fnjie**: Thank you, Angela.
**Jmendez**: Yeah, I.
**Jmendez**: I just did it.
**Jmendez**: We.
**Jmendez**: We do it a lot because it, you know, of.
**Jmendez**: When people lump their PTO together, it's just.
**Fnjie**: Yeah.
**Fnjie**: So I'm going to tell them it.
**Jmendez**: Becomes a little, tiny, tiny, tiny headache.
**Jmendez**: That's all.
**Jmendez**: Because we have to go in, we have to cancel, then we have to manually put it in.
**Jmendez**: And then they're freaking out because they get an email saying that their PTO is canceled.
**Fnjie**: So.
**Fnjie**: And then you're.
**Fnjie**: You're telling me that it's better for them to start adding PTO by the day.
**Jmendez**: Do it by the day.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Jmendez**: And then.
**Jmendez**: Yeah, I mean, I'm not saying that they won't take their full 40 hours.
**Jmendez**: And definitely try not to lump PTO together if it's carrying over into a different pay period.
**Jmendez**: Now Austin is new, so he's kind of getting used to the whole pay cycles and everything, but just encourage them to do it by the day.
**Jmendez**: It just will be so much easier if there's any cancellations or terminations, whatever.
**Fnjie**: Okay, sounds good.
**Jmendez**: It's fixed now.
**Jmendez**: He's good.
**Jmendez**: 72 regular.
**Jmendez**: 8 hours.
**Jmendez**: PTO is already on the timesheet.
**Fnjie**: How much.
**Fnjie**: How many hours is he has?
**Fnjie**: Eight, you said?
**Jmendez**: Yeah.
**Jmendez**: Eight hours of PTO is on this upcoming timesheet and he has 80 regular.
**Jmendez**: I'm sorry, 72 regular hours total.
**Jmendez**: 80.
**Fnjie**: Okay, perfect.
**Fnjie**: So that's good on that side.
**Fnjie**: What else are we missing?
**Fnjie**: Something else.
**Fnjie**: I'd send you the Excel that Fritzi sent to me related to the timesheets.
**Fnjie**: So to you, Angela, just let me know you got it, please.
**Jmendez**: Yeah.
**Jmendez**: Let's have a look.
**Fnjie**: Yes.
**Jmendez**: Okay.
**Jmendez**: These are the daily per diems or the two week period for the two individuals.
**Accounting**: Men.
**Jmendez**: Jack.
**Bclymer**: Curtains.
**Jmendez**: Reimbursement.
**Jmendez**: He has mileage reimbursement.
**Jmendez**: Okay.
**Jmendez**: Easy peasy.
**Fnjie**: Awesome.
**Fnjie**: So.
**Fnjie**: Yep.
**Fnjie**: So I think that's it.
**Fnjie**: If we are missing anything.
**Fnjie**: Free T.
**Fnjie**: I don't think we are, but if anything, just let me know and then.
**Fnjie**: Okay, so we're good to go.
**Fnjie**: Angela.
**Fnjie**: Whatever else.
**Fnjie**: Once.
**Fnjie**: Once we have.
**Fnjie**: Once.
**Fnjie**: I received the.
**Fnjie**: So remember, I don't want you to send me the report.
**Fnjie**: So I know it's an extra step for you, but once I see the payroll is ready for approval on the venture platform.
**Fnjie**: I'm just going to go ahead and check everything makes sense.
**Fnjie**: And if anything, I'll just.
**Fnjie**: As usual, I'll just bother you.
**Jmendez**: And no advances this time.
**Jmendez**: You don't have any advances or anyone receiving funds in house and you need to account for them.
**Fnjie**: No, no, ma'am.
**Fnjie**: This month is okay.
**Fnjie**: And then I think we're still working on getting Ken.
**Fnjie**: I don't know if Brianna knows about it or there's a.
**Fnjie**: We had an employee that only worked for two days, but he wasn't enrolled in the system.
**Fnjie**: So we're working on his paperwork because he.
**Fnjie**: He wasn't able to complete it online in the computer.
**Fnjie**: He wasn't feeling comfortable with that, so.
**Fnjie**: And then I think I'm going to send that soon once he signed everything from the paperwork because we have to pay them for those two days he worked, so.
**Fnjie**: Okay, so I want to keep you posted on that.
**Fnjie**: And we're going to have another employee starting on the 21st of April.
**Fnjie**: So I'm just going to let you know latest as well of that and also related to dawn and for PTO and.
**Fnjie**: Yeah, so that's it.
**Fnjie**: But nothing new from our site.
**Fnjie**: Okay, perfect.
**Fnjie**: I'm going.
**Fnjie**: Sorry.
**Accounting**: How else is everything going?
**Fnjie**: Oh, everything is going great.
**Accounting**: Okay, good.
**Accounting**: We got it all situated.
**Accounting**: Yay.
**Fnjie**: Yeah, no, everything is good.
**Fnjie**: So that's good.
**Fnjie**: And then I'm going to send the entire company to PTO by today.
**Fnjie**: Don't worry, Angela.
**Fnjie**: I'm going to tell them.
**Jmendez**: Yeah, I mean, he may not, you know, Austin may not even get a notice.
**Jmendez**: I don't know.
**Jmendez**: It might be an internal thing that we're doing and he may not get notified.
**Jmendez**: It's just when we cancel it, we just go back in and manually do it.
**Jmendez**: So it'll be there, he'll get, and you'll know that his eight hours is being accounted for.
**Jmendez**: So.
**Fnjie**: Awesome.
**Jmendez**: We are good.
**Jmendez**: DMS enter the mileage and then it'll be coming your way.
**Jmendez**: Perfect.
**Fnjie**: Thank you, Angela.
**Fnjie**: We'll keep you posted and everything is great.
**Fnjie**: So thank you, ladies and thank you, Jose, for joining.
