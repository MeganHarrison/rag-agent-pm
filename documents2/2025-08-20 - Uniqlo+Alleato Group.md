## Transcript
**Aelkarrimy**: Still waiting on some people.
**Aelkarrimy**: Kebab.
**Bclymer**: Ahmed, do you know if Yusuke is joining us?
**Bclymer**: Don't see him.
**Bclymer**: Sorry.
**Jdawson**: I'm just going to text him.
**Kevin.ly**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Here'S means.
**Jdawson**: I know he was traveling to Singapore yesterday, so he might just have a little delay.
**Mparsons**: Check again.
**Jdawson**: I mean, do you know if Yusuke is joining this call?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I think he gonna join.
**Jdawson**: So let's get.
**Mparsons**: Let's give him like a couple minutes.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: But we get started.
**Jdawson**: Mina, can you just repeat that again?
**Jdawson**: Sorry.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Didn'T pick my call.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, he didn't take mine either.
**Kevin.ly**: Do you know if Kevin is joining?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Kevin is going on the business trip today, so.
**Kevin.ly**: Gotcha.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah, let's get started.
**Kevin.ly**: I guess we can.
**Kevin.ly**: We can get started.
**Mparsons**: Yeah.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah, I'll get started with the on site updates.
**Aelkarrimy**: The electrical team, they're moving on to.
**Aelkarrimy**: They started running their feeders to the workstations this week.
**Aelkarrimy**: Our fire sprinkler team, they've been continuing their main pipe installation.
**Aelkarrimy**: And then the BIM printer crew mobilized the site and they started marking up the floors for the exotect racking.
**Aelkarrimy**: And then of course, exotech is continued to receive materials on site.
**Aelkarrimy**: Anybody has any questions for that?
**Mparsons**: I can.
**Aelkarrimy**: I can address it.
**Kevin.ly**: All right, we'll move on to some of the open items.
**Kevin.ly**: So we are anticipating the drawings.
**Kevin.ly**: The other drawings from.
**Bclymer**: From Henderson, they gave us a 829 date.
**Kevin.ly**: So hopefully we do get the electrical and the sprinkler updated drawings.
**Kevin.ly**: Then for the project schedule, we have.
**Bclymer**: The floor marking, as.
**Kevin.ly**: Mike mentioned, that is ongoing.
**Kevin.ly**: They started yesterday.
**Kevin.ly**: And we have added on the schedule some of the inspections that are coming.
**Bclymer**: Up for the anchors and slab edge and a conduit attachment to the walls.
**Kevin.ly**: So we have that schedule for the 28th.
**Kevin.ly**: That's next Thursday.
**Jdawson**: Are the anchors inspections being called now?
**Kevin.ly**: What do you mean being called?
**Jdawson**: Because it says inspections, rack, anchorage, slab edge, and conduit attachment.
**Jdawson**: Thursday, 8:28.
**Kevin.ly**: Correct.
**Jdawson**: So we discussed how we only have, I think four total visits from crosscheck.
**Kevin.ly**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: So we need to try to bulk up as much scope as possible.
**Jdawson**: So I. I just want to make sure that you guys are breaking it out into four.
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah.
**Kevin.ly**: So the reason why we have all of these together in one day.
**Kevin.ly**: From Chris's email, he said these are the three things they are going to look at.
**Kevin.ly**: So we want to have that one.
**Bclymer**: Out of four on the 28.
**Kevin.ly**: So they.
**Kevin.ly**: When they come in, they can look at all these three things.
**Bryan.wagar**: Right.
**Aelkarrimy**: And exotech is starting the racking on the 25th.
**Aelkarrimy**: So they'll have at least done one one racking up.
**Aelkarrimy**: They can, they can look at and can look at what they're doing so they can give that approval and then we'll schedule out the next one for the end of the racking install for system one.
**Mparsons**: Perfect.
**Jdawson**: Thank you.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Kevin.ly**: And for the open change orders, the electrical change orders I sent earlier today.
**Kevin.ly**: So we'll see if we can get approval on that as soon as possible.
**Bclymer**: So we can move on with or resume the electrical submittals and order the materials for that.
**Kevin.ly**: And the other two change orders that.
**Bclymer**: Are still pending approval, the permit fee.
**Kevin.ly**: And the insurance change order that are still open.
**Kevin.ly**: And I think as a reminder, I just.
**Bclymer**: I also attached the transformer credit change.
**Kevin.ly**: Order so that would go with the new electrical change order.
**Kevin.ly**: So once we get all of that.
**Bclymer**: Approved, we can process and yeah, I.
**Bryan.wagar**: Wanted to go over that change order.
**Mparsons**: If we could since we had Brian on the call.
**Kevin.ly**: Gotcha.
**Kevin.ly**: All right, so I guess we can move on to that now.
**Kevin.ly**: Have it open here and Mike will take questions.
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay, I understand.
**Bryan.wagar**: I know all the stuff with the changing.
**Bryan.wagar**: Can you zoom in a little bit, Keva?
**Bryan.wagar**: I'm just curious about the middle lines.
**Bryan.wagar**: TLE6 and TLE7.
**Bryan.wagar**: I thought these 45 KVA transformers were.
**Mparsons**: Already on site and already paid for.
**Kevin.ly**: Correct.
**Bryan.wagar**: Because these two, these two lines shouldn't.
**Mparsons**: Be, we shouldn't be getting charged for this.
**Kevin.ly**: So I guess I can remove those.
**Kevin.ly**: But there is no changes on those.
**Kevin.ly**: You are correct.
**Kevin.ly**: This basically is all the changes that are noted on here.
**Kevin.ly**: We just transfer them.
**Bclymer**: But the charges are for the breakers.
**Kevin.ly**: Added here and some wires that are.
**Bclymer**: Added on these and this one here.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Bryan.wagar**: I mean I'm just comparing it to.
**Mparsons**: The old one that says provide three 125amp break breakers and four gauge aluminum feeders.
**Mparsons**: You know, I'm just, I'm not seeing what's added 10k on here.
**Mparsons**: That's all I see.
**Kevin.ly**: So the changes I'll.
**Kevin.ly**: I'll edit this to only to the.
**Bclymer**: Ones that we are charging for.
**Bclymer**: But the added would be the new 150 breakers and the NC cables that are added here.
**Bschwartz**: Joe, what he didn't put on there is the fact that the old plan had these feeders up close to the panel and the new plan moved that connection, that 150amp connection all the way to the like the bottom of the, of the sheet.
**Bschwartz**: And he should have put on the linear foot difference in between that.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, I just, I just need this breaking down just a little bit more.
**Mparsons**: For my Sake, because Exotech is paying for this change order, of course, minus the 7,000 for the credit.
**Mparsons**: But I just.
**Mparsons**: For my higher ups, I need to know why it went up another 10 grand.
**Mparsons**: I mean, I get that there's bigger parts and you're saying we moved something to go a little farther.
**Bryan.wagar**: I mean, I just.
**Mparsons**: I just need that kind of broken out a little bit, if that's all right.
**Bschwartz**: Yep, absolutely.
**Mparsons**: Because that's going to be the first.
**Bryan.wagar**: Question is, I thought this was seven grand.
**Mparsons**: Why is it 17 grand?
**Mparsons**: And I need to be able to explain that.
**Kevin.ly**: Gotcha.
**Bryan.wagar**: Now how come that move.
**Bryan.wagar**: You said something is a lot farther than it was before.
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah.
**Kevin.ly**: Some of these, I don't know if you recall this from this diagram here.
**Kevin.ly**: And I have this attached to the change order.
**Kevin.ly**: But we have some transformers here.
**Kevin.ly**: And now we're connections are moving down here.
**Bryan.wagar**: Cody, is that right?
**Bryan.wagar**: We move those.
**Cheryl.green**: Is that the.
**Cheryl.green**: The skypath?
**Cheryl.green**: Is that TE5?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Sorry, can you repeat that?
**Bryan.wagar**: Which one's moved?
**Bryan.wagar**: Keva, say that again.
**Kevin.ly**: So if you let me zoom into here.
**Kevin.ly**: So this is the original one that we priced off of.
**Kevin.ly**: I don't know if you guys recall, we had moved these around.
**Bclymer**: So now from these new ones, we.
**Kevin.ly**: Only have these two here and the rest have moved down here.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yes, those are the correct positions.
**Cheryl.green**: Yeah, Joe, that was the original design.
**Cheryl.green**: Had two Skypath cabinets at the back and two at the front.
**Cheryl.green**: And then when you guys revised your.
**Cheryl.green**: Your layout, you moved one of those to the front.
**Cheryl.green**: So that connection extended that.
**Cheryl.green**: What is it?
**Cheryl.green**: Probably a couple hundred feet.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: Okay, now.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, just break it down a little more.
**Bryan.wagar**: Kevin.
**Mparsons**: I'm just.
**Bryan.wagar**: I'm not trying to fight it.
**Mparsons**: I'm just trying to.
**Mparsons**: I just.
**Mparsons**: When I get asked from my superiors why I need to be able to say that I asked and here's the details.
**Kevin.ly**: Understood.
**Mparsons**: And then we'll get it.
**Mparsons**: We'll figure out how to get set up to where we can pay you.
**Kevin.ly**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: Cool.
**Bryan.wagar**: Other than that, we plan on standing up.
**Bryan.wagar**: Rac.
**Bryan.wagar**: We're going to try to at least.
**Mparsons**: Get the first couple done on Friday is the plan.
**Mparsons**: But if not, it'll definitely be Monday.
**Mparsons**: But we have all our deliveries for the uprights coming on Thursday.
**Mparsons**: We also have that ramp that's coming.
**Bryan.wagar**: In that we talked about last time.
**Mparsons**: That will be delivered and we will be able to pull the trucks in, get everything offloaded.
**Mparsons**: Thursday will definitely be a get everything.
**Bryan.wagar**: Situated day and get our.
**Mparsons**: Get our stencils set up and everything ready.
**Mparsons**: And then hopefully they'll Start standing.
**Mparsons**: At least get the first couple on Friday.
**Mparsons**: If not, it'll definitely be Monday.
**Mparsons**: And then about mid next week, we should definitely be ready for sprinklers to start coming in and pushing some pipe through.
**Aelkarrimy**: Sounds good.
**Kevin.ly**: Sounds good.
**Mparsons**: And did I.
**Mparsons**: If I don't have Tilly on this call, I need to forward it to him.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah, he told me about those deliveries coming tomorrow.
**Mparsons**: Yep, perfect.
**Mparsons**: The entire series.
**Bryan.wagar**: That's all I got.
**Jdawson**: I wanted to.
**Jdawson**: I'm sorry, Joe, go ahead.
**Bryan.wagar**: No, you're good.
**Bryan.wagar**: You go ahead.
**Jdawson**: Kevin.
**Jdawson**: I just wanted to bring up the compressor information that we discussed earlier this.
**Mparsons**: Week or last week.
**Mparsons**: I'm sorry.
**Kevin.ly**: Yes, we did have a meeting with Exotic, so we are waiting for them.
**Bclymer**: To send us more information.
**Kevin.ly**: We.
**Kevin.ly**: They're working on a drawing to.
**Kevin.ly**: To show us their connection points.
**Bclymer**: And then once we get that, we.
**Kevin.ly**: Should be able to share that information with you and us in.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, we have all the actual.
**Bryan.wagar**: How much air is needed for the system.
**Mparsons**: Cody's just working on getting it plotted on the layout as to exactly where and how much it needs to be dropped and then.
**Bryan.wagar**: Think it's.
**Mparsons**: It'll be ready for design.
**Bryan.wagar**: Cody, what.
**Bryan.wagar**: What day next week do you think you'll.
**Bryan.wagar**: You can have that done by.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I should hopefully be able to have that done by the time we have our next meeting.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So.
**Mparsons**: Perfect.
**Jdawson**: And what about the engineering portion behind?
**Bryan.wagar**: Is the plan to go through Henderson?
**Kevin.ly**: I would think so, yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So Brian, whenever you get a chance, if you can send that over as an asa, just so then we can get that approved and then we can get the download from Aliatino and Exotech and I guess we can try to put that as a bulletin too.
**Jdawson**: But if we can maybe review and issue some sketches just to keep the ball moving.
**Jdawson**: If, if the compressor scope is like ready to be installed and we need it now.
**Jdawson**: Now, now.
**Jdawson**: But if it's not, I'm going to give Henderson the full flexibility to just digest the information and see how it's going to need to be incorporated into the engineering portions.
**Cheryl.green**: Yeah, if the ask is for us to take that on, I think we need a.
**Cheryl.green**: Either we can discuss it here or we can set up a one off call.
**Cheryl.green**: I would prefer it to be a one off call so I can make sure I get my plumbing technical lead in to be able to digest too.
**Cheryl.green**: But we need to understand what the ask is, what Henderson is being asked to design before we put together an ASA for that.
**Bryan.wagar**: I think.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, I think this definitely want.
**Bryan.wagar**: I want this to be a One off call because this is going to.
**Mparsons**: Be directly to Exotech.
**Mparsons**: I don't want this to get mixed in with any of Uniglo's scope or responsibilities.
**Mparsons**: This is strictly Exotech asking if Aliato can take over this, this scope as far as designing and, and installing it.
**Kevin.ly**: Okay.
**Bschwartz**: Yeah.
**Bschwartz**: So Brian, like, you know, Joe asked us to, to put the install in, but I, I wouldn't even want to start to try and figure out the size of everything based on the runs and the compressor and all that.
**Bschwartz**: So.
**Bschwartz**: Yeah, we just, we just need some help and would need that design put together for it.
**Bschwartz**: So.
**Cheryl.green**: Okay.
**Cheryl.green**: Yeah, see if we can find some time.
**Cheryl.green**: I may have some time later this week, but most, most likely next week, early next week.
**Cheryl.green**: If we can set up a call, I'll forward along to my appropriate parties to be.
**Cheryl.green**: To loop in on that and we could discuss exactly what the request is and, and make sure that we're all in alignment.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, we can do that.
**Bryan.wagar**: I mean, basically we just want to.
**Mparsons**: Pay Aliato and then Aliato and handle, handle it from there.
**Kevin.ly**: Okay.
**Kevin.ly**: Joe, do you think it would be a good idea to set up that meeting after we receive those drawings from you guys?
**Bryan.wagar**: I mean, if we want to do this Thursday.
**Bryan.wagar**: Does everybody have Thursday?
**Mparsons**: I don't want to take up everybody's time on this call, but Thursday, Looking at next Thursday, Next Thursday at.
**Mparsons**: It has to be later, maybe 3pm.
**Bschwartz**: If we kind of back into this, like when would air be needed?
**Bschwartz**: Like how much design times needed?
**Bschwartz**: We can guesstimate on an install and you know, selecting this air compressor I think is the most important thing.
**Bschwartz**: I don't know if they got smarter sitting around, but it looks like they're rather special order, high tech somewhat for an air compressor, but like based on all that.
**Bschwartz**: And Joe, do you know, like, when, when is this air need to be running?
**Bryan.wagar**: We would like to have the install.
**Mparsons**: Complete by February or by mid February.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Bschwartz**: So I don't know, Brian, like the design for this.
**Bschwartz**: Is that a week's worth of.
**Bschwartz**: Is it just not going to take that long, you think?
**Cheryl.green**: I mean, it's, it shouldn't take us much of a lift, but at the same time it's going to depend on how many, how many drops are there, Joe?
**Bryan.wagar**: Cody?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Drops in terms of electrical or.
**Bryan.wagar**: No, how many hookups, how many machines.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: For the air compressors?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yes, I'd have to confirm that count because I don't have it on the top of my head right now, but I believe we have 10 on the bottom Joe, do you call it.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Do you recall if the RFIDs need them?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: No, then I would.
**Mparsons**: So it's on the south side?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I think if we're just talking about the sealers and the erectors, that's 10 right there.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And then I don't remember about the labeling lines, but they might need a little bit.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So somewhere between 10 and 14, I think would be my guess.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I'd have to double check though.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, and those are per machine.
**Mparsons**: That doesn't mean we need that many drops from the ceiling.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yes, I don't have the exact drop from ceiling.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: That's just machines.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Sorry, I should have clarified.
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay, Leon, can we just, can we have a conversation with them?
**Bryan.wagar**: Do you get.
**Bryan.wagar**: I mean, do you guys have any time tomorrow, Tomorrow maybe that we can.
**Mparsons**: Have a call on the side just.
**Bryan.wagar**: To talk about the scope.
**Cheryl.green**: Design?
**Bryan.wagar**: Me and you and Alia too?
**Cheryl.green**: Tomorrow?
**Cheryl.green**: Yeah, I've got a few openings tomorrow that I could probably squeeze in a 30 minute meeting or so.
**Mparsons**: Okay, what.
**Mparsons**: What time's best for you?
**Cheryl.green**: I'm open from 10am until 12:30pm Central.
**Cheryl.green**: And then if that doesn't work, then I've got, I've got a small gap from 2:30 to 3:30.
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay, let's do.
**Bryan.wagar**: Kevin, can you set something up for.
**Mparsons**: 11:30 tomorrow Eastern Time?
**Kevin.ly**: I do have a meeting from 11:30 to 12.
**Bschwartz**: You can.
**Bschwartz**: Are we talking 11:30 Central Time or Eastern time?
**Mparsons**: Eastern.
**Bschwartz**: Eastern.
**Bschwartz**: You can just shift that, Kevin, because everyone that's on that call can be in this meeting.
**Bschwartz**: Okay, we'll just finish that up after.
**Kevin.ly**: Gotcha.
**Kevin.ly**: All right, so 11:30.
**Kevin.ly**: I'm gonna set it up.
**Cheryl.green**: 11:30 Eastern you said?
**Bclymer**: Correct.
**Cheryl.green**: Are you free 11:30 Central?
**Cheryl.green**: So 12:30 Eastern?
**Cheryl.green**: Joke.
**Mparsons**: Yes.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, that's fine.
**Bryan.wagar**: Let's do it.
**Cheryl.green**: Could we do that instead?
**Cheryl.green**: It looks like my, my plumbing lead has a block of time until 11:30, so I want to make sure he's, he's available for that.
**Mparsons**: Let's see, 12:30 tomorrow.
**Kevin.ly**: All right, we'll send out the invite.
**Bryan.wagar**: Leon, Cody, is that okay?
**Bryan.wagar**: We.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, it should be okay for me.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: What time again?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I'm sorry.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: 12:30 Eastern.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Oh, yeah, that's perfect.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Cheryl.green**: Before we change topics, Ahmed, is that ASA going to go through you or would exatec be paying us?
**Jdawson**: No idea at this point.
**Bryan.wagar**: It's gonna.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, it's.
**Bryan.wagar**: Let's talk about it.
**Bryan.wagar**: Let's talk about it tomorrow.
**Cheryl.green**: Okay.
**Bryan.wagar**: I definitely don't want to pay the TPG fee.
**Jdawson**: Damn.
**Jdawson**: I completely get it.
**Jdawson**: And whatever, Brian, whatever, whatever you guys are are flexible with.
**Jdawson**: But let me first just talk to my Brian, and then maybe he'll give you a call.
**Cheryl.green**: Okay.
**Cheryl.green**: Yeah, just.
**Cheryl.green**: Just let me know, since we're trying to circumvent the.
**Cheryl.green**: The Uniqlo thing on this.
**Jdawson**: So I'll text you tonight, because I know he's going to say it's okay, but I just want to cover, you know, cym, just in case, and then I'll.
**Jdawson**: I'll let you know.
**Cheryl.green**: Sounds good.
**Mparsons**: Thanks.
**Kevin.ly**: All right.
**Kevin.ly**: Anything else?
**Jdawson**: Good on my.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Kevin.ly**: Brian?
**Bclymer**: Joe?
**Cheryl.green**: Nope.
**Cheryl.green**: Good for my end.
**Bryan.wagar**: Thank you.
**Kevin.ly**: All right, we'll end it here then.
**Jdawson**: Thanks, guys.
**Bschwartz**: Thanks, everybody.
**Bschwartz**: We'll see you.
**Bryan.wagar**: Thank you.
