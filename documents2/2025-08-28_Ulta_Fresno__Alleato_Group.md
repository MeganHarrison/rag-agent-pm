## Overview
- Ulta Fresno HVAC upgrade aims to comply with new California regulations to maintain workplace temperatures below 87¬∞F; external temps may reach 105¬∞F.  
- Building struggles with temperature control; original target of 75¬∞F revised to 80¬∞F at peak outdoor conditions for cost efficiency and feasibility.  
- Existing system consists of multiple 25-ton units; potential upgrade to 70-ton units would necessitate extensive structural reinforcement analysis due to increased weight.  
- Hot zones identified on the third level of the pick module; inadequate air circulation exacerbating temperature issues needs addressing.  
- Temporary cooling measures include external trailer units and HVLS fans; diesel-powered solutions face CARB compliance and have limited operational hours.  
- Ongoing temperature monitoring shows problem areas stabilizing around 86¬∞F, while operational control is manual and dependent on monitoring.  
- Recommendations include better strategic unit placement, enhanced ductwork for the third level, and adding HVLS fans in speed bay areas for improved air circulation.  
- Budget set at under $3.3M; design costs estimated below $25K with a completion deadline of January 31st to avoid re-approval.  
- Previous work with Aledo Group on similar HVAC modifications for Ulta‚Äôs facilities suggests established vendor reliability, with a $300K contract in Dallas as reference.  
- Solar panels recently added to the building; updated electrical capacity drawings are needed to assess integration with existing systems.  

## Short Summary
The Ulta Fresno HVAC upgrade aims to meet new California regulations requiring workplace temperatures below 87¬∞F, even as external conditions may reach 105¬∞F. The building currently struggles with temperature management, prompting a revision of the target from 75¬∞F to 80¬∞F for cost efficiency. The existing HVAC system consists of multiple 25-ton units, while a proposed upgrade to 70-ton units requires a structural analysis due to weight concerns. Hot zones were identified on the third level, where inadequate air circulation is a critical issue. Temporary measures include external trailer units and HVLS fans, though diesel solutions face CARB compliance challenges. Current monitoring indicates problem areas stabilize around 86¬∞F, with manual operational control. Recommendations involve strategic unit placement, enhanced ductwork, and additional HVLS fans to improve airflow. The budget is set at under $3.3M, with a design cost below $25K and a completion deadline of January 31st. A prior successful partnership with Aledo Group for similar modifications supports vendor reliability, plus recent solar panel installations necessitate updated electrical capacity assessments.

## Meeting Gist
The meeting focused on upgrading Ulta Fresno's HVAC system to comply with California regulations and enhance temperature control.

## Key Points (Shorthand)
üìã **Project Overview & Requirements** (00:00 - 02:16)
HVAC upgrade project for Ulta's Fresno distribution center to meet new California regulatory requirements for workplace temperature control.
Current challenge: Building struggles to maintain temperatures below 87¬∞F during peak summer heat, with external temps reaching 105¬∞F.
Regulatory compliance: California law requires action when heat reaches 82¬∞F and rising, with mandatory breaks at 87¬∞F.
Target temperature adjustment: Originally discussed 75¬∞F but revised to 80¬∞F at 105¬∞F external temperature for cost efficiency and feasibility.
üèóÔ∏è **Existing Infrastructure Assessment** (00:21 - 14:11)
Current HVAC system: Multiple 25-ton units (3,800 pounds each) serving main warehouse areas, plus smaller units for pick module.
Structural considerations: Upgrading to 70-ton units would double the weight, requiring significant structural reinforcement analysis.
Pick module hot zones: Third level (closest to ceiling) identified as most problematic area with inadequate air circulation.
Building layout: Left half is racking area, right side includes mezzanine with operators and elevated conveyor systems.
üõ†Ô∏è **Current Temporary Solutions** (09:04 - 39:07)
Supplemental cooling: External trailer units with ducting to third level aisles, plus HVLS fans for air circulation.
Diesel generator powered: Temporary units burn diesel with CARB compliance restrictions, cannot run 24/7.
Temperature monitoring: 5-6 monitors throughout building tracking hottest locations, maintaining around 86¬∞F in problem areas.
Operational challenge: Manual on/off control based on temperature monitoring to avoid unnecessary diesel consumption.
üîß **Technical Solutions & Recommendations** (06:26 - 40:05)
Strategic unit placement: Focus on girders near columns for optimal structural load distribution versus mid-joist installations.
Ductwork improvements: Adding perforated flexible duct to third level pick module area for better air circulation.
HVLS fan additions: Recommended for speed bay areas to improve air movement.
Power optimization: Pre-cooling strategy suggested - run units 3am-6am during coolest temperatures for efficiency.
üìä **Project Scope & Electrical Considerations** (25:26 - 35:52)
Solar integration: Recently added solar panels on west side of building, updated drawings needed.
Electrical capacity: Existing panels appear to have space for additional units based on current drawings.
Power limitations: Temporary rental units couldn't connect to existing power due to insufficient capacity.
Building age: 2017 construction with original HVAC units, no major replacements to date.
üí∞ **Budget & Timeline Discussion** (19:47 - 44:29)
Project budget: Under $3.3M with preliminary design costs under $25K (originally quoted $50K).
Timeline concern: Must complete by January 31st (fiscal year end) to avoid capital committee re-approval.
Lead times: Install time expected under one month, permitting in California is main unknown factor.
Payment structure: Milestone-based payments similar to previous Greenwood project.
ü§ù **Vendor Relationship & Previous Work** (26:12 - 47:43)
Established relationship: Aledo Group previously completed HVAC work for Ulta's Greenwood and Dallas facilities.
Dallas experience: Similar conveyor-related HVAC modifications, approximately $300K in work.
Vendor status: Confirmation needed on Aledo Group's approved vendor status with Ulta.


## Bullet Points Summary
üå°Ô∏è Temperature Compliance: HVAC upgrade aims to keep workplace temperatures below 87¬∞F, even with external temps hitting 105¬∞F.
üîß System Upgrades: Existing 25-ton units may be replaced with 70-ton units, requiring structural reinforcements.
üí® Airflow Issues: Hot zones on the third level indicate poor air circulation needing immediate attention.
üí∞ Budget Constraints: The project budget is capped at $3.3M, with design costs estimated under $25K.
‚òÄÔ∏è Renewable Energy: Recent solar panel installations call for updated electrical capacity drawings for better integration.

## Transcript

**Allen, Walter:**
I've had to cancel on you a couple times, so it's all good. But I'm glad to hear that you're doing things for Tina also. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah, yeah. So we'll, you know, do our get her design updated and you know, get her rolling over there so they get, you know, use that empty space up top. 

**Allen, Walter:**
So. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
All right, couple things. I'm gonna go ahead and share my screen here. So your, your existing space here. So this is your roof plan for the existing H vac that you have. And so you can see here where you've got these weights for the different size units. Right. So these are your 25 tons, these 3,800 pounders. Okay. And then these are your smaller ones that feed your pick module. And so what we were talking about was replacing all of these 3,800 pound ones. Now the biggest question I know we said 75 degrees on 100 some odd degree day. And that's just like what a lot of times we do in Indiana. Right, that's what yours was built out in Indiana, but that's a way different climate. So when I went through. So the, the new law in, in California, it's, you know, the heat, if the heat is 82 and rising, that's when you guys have to go into your stuff. So is that what you're trying to adhere to or is it just, you want to, you know, 75 degrees? Because it's a big difference. 

**Allen, Walter:**
We're trying to adhere to the new regulatory requirement, but. But we don't want to be in a position where we make this upgrade and then find out because of whatever reasons, whatever, you know, whatever other factors, we are still not able to achieve or meet that requirement. So the number I gave you was anticipating that, you know, if they had the doors open or the installation is not what we'd expect it to be, that we would probably be safe. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
So. Okay, I'm glad that I know that now. So what I would encourage you to do is to up it to 80 degrees. Because getting to 75 in California, it's difficult. It's a lot of tonnage. And so I would encourage us to say we're going to hit for 80 degrees. And then I've already gone through all of your existing building drawings and put in the insulation in the walls, the insulation on the roof, you know, to where we know what that R factor is, to calculate that in our stuff and then also put a safety factor on it as well. But upping that to just, you know, 80 degrees versus 75 is really going to help your, your numbers. 

**Allen, Walter:**
Okay, yeah, no, that's fair. If you're pretty confident and that we could land 80 consistently even at, you know, I think it was 105 the last time I was out there. So we're saying 80 at what temperature? 

**Brandon Clymer:**
So the, the way that I'm looking at it is per the average day, like I went and I took the average weather in there, 103 outside temperature is the number. Now what I am going to do is I'll base, I want to run the calcs and say 80 on 105. So now you've got, you know, you're conservative on both ends on the outside temperature and the inside temperature because it's really, you have to be 82 rising to 87 is what the, the California code is. Right. And so if we say we're 80 on the front, 105 on the outside, then you've got a couple degrees contingency on both ends. And so that's going to give you some safety factor. 

**Allen, Walter:**
Okay. No, that's fair. I like that. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Because what I'd like to do is, you know, if we, if we have to. So let's meet. Let me go to the structural. So the biggest thing. Let me see here. When I looked at your structural. Okay, let's see here. My framing. Typical. Nope, I don't want to. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
There. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
So these are, they have reinforced where all these 25 ton units are. And if we use 70 ton units, it's about double the weight that we'd have to do. See here, Bear with me. Let me find that page conveyor. Here we go. Okay, so you can see here. So this is where one of those units are that RTU. RTU 2, ¬£3,500. Here's the curb size. And this is where it's mounted. Okay, now you can see here, see where this. 3.4, 3.4, 2.9. All these are different ratings for those joists and how much they can carry. Now these right here are what's called girders. Okay. So if you look up, you know, at, you know, Indy, for instance, between your columns, you have those big ones that are like five foot big. Those are, those are called the girders. So obviously those are much stronger than joists because you see how this one's just sitting in the middle of all these joists. And. And so the load has to travel out and then down. And so those joists, the weakest point is in the middle. And so what we typically do for any warehouses is we try to Set something like that. And so you've got the heaviest points sitting on a girder and right against the column. So that load just has a travel. So what that means is ideally we would just be reinforcing something like this piece right here. 

**Allen, Walter:**
Yeah, I'm following you. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Right, that's the, that's the goal versus, you know, like over here to put it here. You know, they're reinforcing probably this entire, you know, if we, if this, if this wasn't, didn't come beefed up, they'd be. You'd be reinforcing the entire thing because it sits in the middle. So for instance, like the way that we had to reinforce down in Dallas because the conveyor point loads, we had to do a complete reinforcement, top and bottom cord, all the webs on several of those because just the way that the conveyor laid out and the point load attachments. So if we can, if we can do that, then that would be ideal. Now the one thing I don't know and I need to calculate is the power because there's two different ways to do that now. You know, we're gonna, if we change the numbers to be 80 at 105 versus 75 at 110, then we should be less cooling needed and therefore we can look. And so instead of, you know, before we had like four 70 ton units and 150 ton unit, well, maybe that goes down, you know, six 25 tons or 650, whatever that is, like that can condense a little bit, which is going to help you on your power. So the biggest thing with taking the 25s off and putting in bigger ones in those locations was well, we can save on some power if need be, but if we can reduce it and say we're only adding like four units total, you know, two on this side and two on this side or something like that. Because you're, you know, where. I'm not sure what this is. I'm assuming this is set up like the other ones, correct? Yeah, yeah. So you're, you're gonna need, you know, two down here and two down here. Or maybe we do, you know, four and four, you know, right over the speed bays and everything where most of your stuff is going. Because your pick mod has already got four units and it's probably cool enough, to be honest. I would think. And especially it's really not. Do you have the fans in that one? 

**Allen, Walter:**
We do have fans in it, but the third level is our problematic area, you know, closest to the ceiling, obviously. Yeah, that's our challenge. We know where we've been monitoring our temperatures in there, and they're definitely not able to keep up. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Okay, so these. Because these four are all ducted. 

**Allen, Walter:**
Yeah. Right. Now what we're doing this year is we're supplemental air to the building. So I got units. I think you guys actually did this for Greenwood was we got external units pumping air to the building. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah. Those trailers. 

**Allen, Walter:**
Yeah. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
I think you have some HVLS fans in here, if I'm not mistaken. Correct. 

**Allen, Walter:**
We do. Yes. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah. Okay. Here we go. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Do you know how much, like, how many tons of air are you supplementing from the outside currently? Do you know? 

**Allen, Walter:**
Just one moment. See if I can pull it up real quick. It's a good question. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah. Here's your fans. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Boom. Yeah. The one page that I need to see or pick mod is not included, really. In 2.3 shows this exact thing. Those are 12 and a half. Yeah. Well, upstairs. So I don't have a. I didn't realize that you had that hot zone up there, Walter. So I don't have a solution for you and I. Unfortunately, this drawing is missing that tells me exactly what the duct layout is for that space. 

**Allen, Walter:**
Yeah. I think we can get there, though, To. Is it. It's Jesse, right? Yeah. Pronounce your name. We know what we're doing to supplement the air. And I can get you guys that information. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Yeah, we know how many. 

**Allen, Walter:**
We'll give you an indicator of. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Yeah. 

**Allen, Walter:**
If we're on track to. To meet. Because right now in those hot areas, we're maintaining right around 86. So we probably just need a little bit more. But again, that's the. We went through the building and found the low. The worst case scenario of where our associates are working. And we have monitors there to make sure we don't exceed 87. Because when you exceed 87, then we're required to give them additional breaks and things. So let me find that information. I can give that to you. That'll help us, too, I think. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah. That would be huge. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Do you have. 

**Allen, Walter:**
You know. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
And just. I don't know how it's configured, but are those external units just blowing into, like, a dock door, or are they ducted into the space? 

**Allen, Walter:**
So they are. There is some ducting that is directed directly towards that third level aisle. So we get some benefit of the, you know, the air blowing into there. And then we got the fans up there assisting. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
So basically what you're doing is you're running that flex duct from here kind of as Far as you can to the edge of this pick mod. Right through. 

**Allen, Walter:**
Yeah. It's actually on the opposite side, but yes, in concept. Yes, exactly what we're doing. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Okay. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
And so, like, if we have hot points, like, we could target those areas with the new units, ducting it to specific locations or is it a problem elsewhere? 

**Allen, Walter:**
We would probably have to do that, considering the different areas. Like, if you go back to the first slide or the previous. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yep. 

**Allen, Walter:**
One there, you can kind of see the building layout. You know, our. You know, our associates are throughout the entire building. They have different work areas that they exist. So if you took from page left half of the building, that's basically all racking. Yeah. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Right. Yeah, Just like this area. Right. Basically right up to the trash line. So this is that trash line, Jesse. And then they've got elevated. Do you guys have that? You have that same elevated conveyor right here? 

**Allen, Walter:**
We do, yeah. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah. So right here is where they've got that platform that, like. Same thing, actually. It's right there. Yeah, you can see it. And so, yeah, all this is, you know, a major hot zone, it sounds like. I'd say probably over here. Same thing. This is your inbound, right. I think. 

**Allen, Walter:**
Yep. So there's a mezzanine up right over there where you were at, too. So. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yep. Yeah. This one right here. 

**Allen, Walter:**
Yep. That's. We really where you had the box currently. Yes, that's our inbound, doc. There are associates working in that space, but the hot point is the second level, which is just to the right of it. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah. Talking about this right here. 

**Allen, Walter:**
Yeah, yeah. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Which, you know, there's no fan there. I mean, that. That would help. 

**Allen, Walter:**
We can get the right tonnage in there to be able to cool it. I think in some ductwork, we'll probably be okay. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah. I mean, there's nothing, you know, you've got. Right here. This is it. Just one. One little one. You know, it's a. It's a 12 and a half ton right there. 

**Allen, Walter:**
Yeah. So I know that's actually for that space or the office underneath that mezzanine. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Oh, it's. It's probably for the office then, actually. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
So. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah. You have nothing really blowing over there. 

**Allen, Walter:**
Yeah, Yeah. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
I mean, you've got. Right here. And then all this is. Yeah. For the office. So. Yeah. There's your diffusers right there. So. And then all of this is probably. Okay. Correct. 

**Allen, Walter:**
Yeah. It's first level, floor level from there on out. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
And this is all fine as well. 

**Allen, Walter:**
Yes. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Okay. So what I was thinking, the reason I was looking for that drawing, Walter, is because. So I see here, this is that duct. So, you know, here's the vertical coming down and then it shows branching off and then you've just got a diffuser, which is that arrow there going through the mezzanine or the Pikmin, I should say. And it, you know, if fours one and two are good, I don't know if there's duct on the third level, the top level or not. That's what I was wanting to look at because it may be as simple as changing that 12 and a half to a 25 ton because it should be the same curb size. And so it's just boom, boom. And then adding duct on that top level, like it would be like that. That cloth flexible duct that you've seen that's just got a little perforated holes all the way through it. If you've ever seen those same in gymnasiums a lot. Yeah, yeah, that's what I would. That's what I would expect. I think if, again, if you don't have any duct there, which again, I can't tell, but I think that would solve a lot of that issue and would be. Because it's. I don't think it's the tonnage that's probably the problem here. It's the lack of air movement. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Yeah. The more we can extend the supply away from that return, you're going to get a lot better air movement across that whole area where now it's just kind of short cycles almost. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Right. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
So. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
That would. Yeah, I mean, that would be. Because you got this one. This one. This one. Yeah, Because I mean, this goes all the way here. Yeah, it just, it looks like. See, this is just blowing. So that air is stopping and it's probably really hot, like right around there. And it would be the same thing like around here where that air just stops. You know, it dissipates about this far. 

**Allen, Walter:**
Yep. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Okay. So, yeah, so that's. And then, yeah, I think adding a HVLS fan over here, one or two of them will help a lot with these speed bays. And then from there it's again just adding some tonnage. And if you can, when you find out what you're currently doing on that tonnage, then that, that'll help, you know, to alleviate it. But all in all, I think upping it is really going to help a lot with your calcs, because that was the thing I was having a hard time getting you at 75, that's a hard, hard measure. So, so what I, what I want to do is do some preliminary calcs. And I know I told you 50 grand, it's actually going to be like under 25 to go ahead and get. All right, here's, you know, here's, you know, your best option. And then, you know, if there's other things that. Well, for instance, we want, I don't know, to get at 77 versus 80 or whatever that is, then we can give you a couple options. Or if you just want to do 80 at 105, then we'll just do that. But the, the number will be less than that. I just want to give you a. Not to exceed. 

**Allen, Walter:**
Yeah, no, I like the thought of having options there because again, the last thing I could have is we deliver this and it still doesn't meet the requirement. So I'd rather give ourselves some breathing room here if, you know, if possible. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah, yeah. So we'll calculate, you know, here's the minimum, right. Which we're going to say our minimum is 80 on 105. And then we'll say here is a beefed up approach, you know, and so we'll say that maybe the beefed up approaches, we'll take it down to, you know, 70. We can do 75. It's a, it's going to be a lot. I mean, I can show you 75 if you want what that looks like. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
And Walter, like, if we're to snapshot these three squares, has anyone ever gone in with like just a temperature meter? And like, when I'm in, say we got three zones here. Zone one, it's on the hot day, it's 90, zone two is 86, and zone three, it's 80. Do you, have you ever taken any of those type of readings? 

**Allen, Walter:**
Yeah, we are currently tracking it every day and probably have a history of at least four, four or five months at this point. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
And it's over the summer, which is great for us. 

**Allen, Walter:**
Yeah, yeah. I could tell you, you know, we. I think we have five or six monitors throughout the building. And again, we kind of found the hottest place just by taking a thermometer around. I could give you those locations and give you the data that shows the temperature swings. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
That, That'll be huge because I'd be curious to see what it is on this third floor here versus what it is in this racking bay. Versus here. Right. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
And just being able to customize this design. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah. To get. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Putting this new air to be, you know, efficient and. 

**Allen, Walter:**
Okay, let me get you that data. I'll take a drawing indicating where the, the monitors are. And then seeing data that'll help. Now, again, we don't have them placed throughout the building. We took the hottest locations. So the assumption is that, you know, if we're able to maintain it in those locations, the rest of building is well under. And the challenge with it, though, is it's misleading to some degree because we have the incoming or the supplemental arrow on, call it the north side of this drawing, and the hotspot is actually on the south side because we just can't get it over to there. So it's a little bit misleading, but it'll take. It definitely clearly tells you, like, the pick mods are the hottest and, you know, like, where you've drawn it out there. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Well, yeah, I mean, we'll, you know, you've got that location. And then if you also say, all right, here's what I've got, I've got three trailers that are each pushing 50 tons of cooling each, and here's where they're ducted to, then we can take that into account. Because if you're, like you said, your trailers are all on this side, and then you're saying that this plan south is. Is. Is hotter. Correct. 

**Allen, Walter:**
Yeah, yeah. Because we. If you remember, we. To the right of that square is a. Is a mezzanine area where we have operators. So just to the right there, where. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
It says this right here. 

**Allen, Walter:**
Yeah, yeah, yep. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah, yeah. This whole thing is in your mez. 

**Allen, Walter:**
Yeah, yeah. But there are only operators on that far right side of it. So. Right, this is our hottest point. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah, this is all your mechanical. Yeah, right here, I think. And then this is where you've got some. Yeah, here's your stairs and you've got. I think you got some workstations kind of right here, I think. 

**Allen, Walter:**
Yeah, yeah. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Which again, I mean, you know, looking at this, you've got a fan here and no, no real movement over here. This feeds. Oh, that's just your ducting for your equipment charging. There's another. Yeah, so. Yeah. So cool in there. So. But, you know, if, if, if we, you know, you've got the hot zones identified. Do you know if. Do you have any temperature recording of anything over here? 

**Allen, Walter:**
We may have some old data from previous year where we had them spread out through the building. Or we could also pull it from, I think, our thermostats. I think we had the ability to look at some history there. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah. Even if you have last year's data, like before you brought in temp H vac, that's fine, because then that tells us your Baseline without any added cooling. Because I'd be curious to see what that is getting. You know, is that sitting at 85 or 80. Right. Because again, we don't want to add a bunch of stuff over here where there's nobody at and cool empty space. 

**Allen, Walter:**
No, exactly. Okay. There's one other thing we have to consider here that the drawings don't depict from a load standpoint. We have solar in this building that was just recently added, so the drawings don't have it. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Do you have a drawing that shows where the solar is? 

**Allen, Walter:**
I'll get you the updated drawings to send you that. I just thought of it as we're. As we're looking at this one, but we strategically did it to the left of the drawing plan. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
West here. Right over here. Playing west over here is where they roll. Yeah. Thank God. I was worried you were gonna say this over here. 

**Allen, Walter:**
No, we did that because we anticipate we're gonna add additional conveyor in the future which will be on the right side. Yeah. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Is that same thing you did at Dallas and Indy? 

**Allen, Walter:**
Yep, exactly. So, yeah. Did you do the Dallas building or were you part of that or contracted for that? 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yep. 

**Allen, Walter:**
Okay. Yeah. So we're going to do the same exact thing here. You know, Greenwood was last year. Dallas is this year. Fresno's supposedly next year, but I don't think we're going to do it next year. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Well, we'll go out there and take care of it. Yeah, I think. Because we even. I think in Dallas we. Kelly had us update some of your guys. H Vac for that one as well. 

**Allen, Walter:**
We did it where some of the automatic storage retrieval landed. We had a couple units that were in the way, is what I recall. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Well, I think we had to. We had some units that were just not working that we replaced. I think two of them or something like that. Yeah, I think. I mean, it was like. I don't know, it was like 300,000 in work or something or the other. 

**Allen, Walter:**
I remember. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
So. All right, well, that's good. So then is. And obviously. Yeah, your electrical room and everything. Same layouts over here. And then you've got another one over here, I believe. So that makes all the runs easier. 

**Allen, Walter:**
So. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah, I would. I would bet that we don't need to put anything over here, which is good. We can focus and just hit these areas. And especially because, you know, right here is an easy set along these speed bays. It's not. We don't have to reach very far. If you remember Greenwood, we had to use a helicopter. 

**Allen, Walter:**
Yeah. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
And so if we can just set these here and then, you know, set a few here, that's a much easier pick. The only unknown, and I just, I gotta look and see how this is all ducted is if we have to change out any of these four. That's a very, very long pick. Ideally, again, it's know, we'll look at your temperature and stuff. I'd love it if we could just add some duct, something like that to get this area cooled down and some fans, get some air moving versus, you know, having to, to replace those units. But we'll just, we'll have to do the calc and see what it looks like. 

**Allen, Walter:**
Okay. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
So if you can send us those, we'll get to work. I should be able to have this in a week. 

**Allen, Walter:**
Just kind of at a high level, knowing the lead times and, you know, time for install, et cetera, total time to complete the project, would that push us past February of next year? 

**Brandon Clymer:**
So if, let's say that, you know, we get you to, you know, the numbers and you guys move, you know, reasonably fast. Right. As far as approval goes, I don't think so. The biggest unknown is permitting. I, I, it's California. Like, you know, I, I can't, it may be federalized. It may be a different country by then. I, you know, I have no idea. That's the biggest unknown. I can tell you. I'm not, I'm not too worried about lead times. We can get, you know, these units, you know, before then install time, assuming that we're going to do, you know, nothing super crazy, and we can do the simple plan like what I'm wanting to do. I would expect install time to be under a month. And the, one of the largest drivers of that time frame is going to be whatever steel reinforcement we have to do, which I'm not going to know until we do the calculations to figure out what the reinforcement is. I can guess, but I just don't know. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
And the good thing is like, we, you know, steel available, ducts available, we can rough everything in prep everything. So when the units show up, it's just a matter of setting them and turning them on. 

**Allen, Walter:**
So that's what I was thinking. That was what I was hoping for, just so that we can try to deliver that. The reason I'm asking is because our end of year is January 31st. So in order to, if we go over that, then I have to go back to capital committee and get approval again. So I just need to know in. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Advance what we've done some with Other clients, because they're running the same issue is, let's say if for some reason, you know, it's going to bleed over or whatever, I'll charge you up front, you know, for everything in the year, you know, and then hold it that way you don't have to go back to capital committee and you can get it through. 

**Allen, Walter:**
Okay, that's, that's fair. That'd be another possibility there. Yep. One of the things that has kind of been pointed out as a concern is we brought those supplemental air units on and we're not able to connect them to our existing power because we don't have the capacity. So knowing that, are we going to run into any risk or any challenges there? 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Well. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Unless this is wrong, your. So I went through your electrical and you have space now, again, unless this is incorrect. And then I, you know, I don't. Now, this doesn't have any solar either. So what's the. Where's the solar feeding and how does that, you know, work? Because you've got, you know, if I go to your one line here, you know, you've got your two utility points for 3,000. And again, it shows on your drawings that your main, you have some empty space in this 4000amp main distribution panel. If that's not the case, then I don't know. But it looks like you have capacity based off of this. 

**Allen, Walter:**
It's possible, I mean, it could be that the rental company that brought us to chillers didn't want to do the effort there. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Well, it also depends on what size those things are too, because again, if it's, you know, and how far away it is, things like that, like if it's pulling 1200amps or something like that, you might just not have space, like, for it. Like you don't have space for a 1200amp breaker. Right. Your biggest breakers that you're using are 600. And so it would, I would, you know, be surprised if you had that much space for that size of a breaker. So, you know, maybe they need their. Whatever chillers they have, need 800 or a thousand amp breakers, which wouldn't work. So what we would do is again, we, we would put, you know, take out, you know, some of these small ones. Right. And put in a 400 or a 600 that fits. But based off of these, these calcs, I mean, you should have some space in those. We just need to verify it. 

**Allen, Walter:**
Yeah, I'll send you the updated drawings which should include, you know, the, the existing. Plus the solar. The solar shouldn't have changed anything? They didn't indicate as such to us because that would have been a concern for us. So I'll send you the updated drawings. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Do you have a backup generator on this one too, or. 

**Allen, Walter:**
No, we do have backup generator, but it only supplies basically our IT room. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Right. This one and your. Is it over here? 

**Allen, Walter:**
It's going to be just to the left, right? 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah, there it is. Yep. Okay. So. Yeah, you just. Your crack unit or whatever you got in there. 

**Allen, Walter:**
Yeah, yeah. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
It doesn't. 

**Allen, Walter:**
It doesn't support the entire building, so. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah, yeah, I think that's what we did at Greenwood, too. We just supported the computer room air conditioner. 

**Allen, Walter:**
Yeah, that was a change we had to do, I think, when you were doing the units for us. Yep, yep. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
So, yeah, if you can get those updated, you know, electrical. And then again, that's what having that, like in these preliminary designs, like, we're gonna say, okay, they've got, you know, 500amps, you know, of space or whatever that is per. Per distribution panel. And then back into. All right, so when we. What can we do electric or H vac wise? Because. Yeah, then maybe we do have to steal a 25 ton unit so that we can use that space and run a 50 ton. But looking at. When I looked at this initially, like, it. It didn't look like you were having a problem. So I just, I, you know, obviously want to verify that you have the space. 

**Allen, Walter:**
Okay. No, sounds good. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Do we know, like, what is the age of this building? Are those existing units? Are they over 20 years old? 

**Brandon Clymer:**
20, 17. 

**Allen, Walter:**
Yeah. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Okay. And that you guys probably haven't replaced anything really, have you, Walter? 

**Allen, Walter:**
No, we have not. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah. And I know prologis ain't change anything out. 

**Allen, Walter:**
Yeah, unfortunately. But I mean, these units should have a lifespan of, you know, 15 to 20 years, right? 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Oh, yeah. When you guys are getting. You guys have a service agreement. These are getting quarterly service, so there shouldn't be any issues. Yeah, you know, so. And while we're up there, we'll go through and, you know, check everything or if. If you've got the records of whoever did it, it should show. But I mean, again, I guess I say that, but you had some units that weren't working in Dallas, so. But we'll double check it and make sure everything works because, I mean, we want to make sure that if something's running at 30% or 60% capacity, like, let's change out the fan belt, whatever we got to do to get that thing up to get the tonnage, because you know, we're calculating based off of what this shows. And so it shows you have 250 tons of cooling already in that warehouse. And if you've got three or four units that are running at 50% capacity, well then that's going to throw our calcs off because we're assuming that 250 tons, well, maybe now it's only 175 or 150. 

**Allen, Walter:**
Right? No, yeah. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Does it. And would it help from a standpoint of as soon as we got a permit going in and doing the ductwork modifications that will, in my mind, that would help the situation out immediately to spread that error, you know, closer to the hot spots and get that movement going. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Shoot, you oughta, by that time you're gonna be in the cooler months, I would think. 

**Allen, Walter:**
Yeah, I was gonna say I would be open to any advanced work, but I think, you know, we anticipate that in October we'll stop. We won't need to cool it anymore. We're able to maintain it, you think, starting in October, based on previous year's temperatures, external temperature, with the supplemental error without. You got in there without it. So we, we only. Right now we're only budgeted to carry it until October. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Okay. 

**Allen, Walter:**
It's a pretty costly project for us. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
I bet. So those things are all your cores that you got now are self powered then, right? 

**Allen, Walter:**
Yeah. There we actually got a generator that has to power those and they're burning diesel. So. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
And you got to do. It's got to be that carb, whatever load thing too out there. 

**Allen, Walter:**
Oh yeah, it's. It's a nightmare because even, you know, since it's diesel powered, I, I can't run them 24 7. It can't just burn it to burn it. So we're trying to again, monitor the temperatures to keep it under, you know, 87 for the most part. And it's. We're learning as we go. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Are you. So you can't, you can't run those Coors at night, right? What you're saying? 

**Allen, Walter:**
We try to shut it down when we see the temperature starting to drop and we're. So if we're, let's say if we're maintaining 82 in the building and we know it's 6pm and the temperatures are only likely to go down, we'll shut them down. So we are literally monitoring throughout the day to determine when we turn them on and off. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
So what one thing you might consider doing is, you know, let's say that, you know, because at night, you guys, you guys Are running a what, 50% shift to what you ordered in the day or is it the same thing? 

**Allen, Walter:**
It's pretty much equal in Fresno. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
So okay, so let's say is it, is it like 3am or what? You have like one hour of downtime, right. Is it 2 or 3am or something like that? 

**Allen, Walter:**
Usually in most buildings, 2 to 2 to 6. So it's a four hour plan downtime, but we're behind, they run over. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
So, so yeah, what I was gonna say is so at the height of the cool of the night, right. Is gonna be around midnight, one, two, what A lot of times different places they'll do is they'll run like cross ventilation at night to bring in cold air, shut it down and it sinks down. And so you might consider running those units, starting them at 3am to bring down that temperature and then it slowly rises during the day. And so it's, those units are taking instead of 110 degree air, they're taking 90 degree air, cooling it down to whatever it is, 70 degree air. And then that way that cold air goes in, drops, you know, and then it circulates and stays in and it's gonna, you know, theoretically it shouldn't climb as high. But that's the biggest thing is right in the heat of the day at noon you're taking 110 degree and trying to get it down to 70. And so it's running overtime versus if you can take 90 down to 70, it's going to be way easier. 

**Allen, Walter:**
That's a good point because we're doing just the opposite of what you're suggesting. Right. We're trying to monitor it to see, you know, the temperature increase throughout the day. And then when we reach, I think the guidance is if we know that it's going to exceed 82, then we shut it on or we turn it on two hours prior to the peak point of the day. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah, at 82 you have to start heat, whatever they called it, heat he wear heat awareness or whatever to cool it down. They say you have to kick on cooling to bring it down. And then like you said 87, you got to get breaks. But yeah, I would, I would suggest switch that time and start that early and cool that building down at the lowest temperatures. And then it'll take longer for it to rise during the day and then you know, maybe you're just kicking it on at the tail end or at least you don't have it on in the morning or something like that. Right. But if you can keep that lower to start it's going to benefit you. 

**Allen, Walter:**
That's a good thought. We'll see there. Hopefully we're almost through the woods here because the temperatures are very similar to Indiana and then it's starting to drop down there in Fresno. So. Okay, the things I got to provide you guys is the chiller info and then the solar drawings and then the temp data that we've had further, mainly for this year, but also the previous years. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yep. Yeah. And then if you got up, you know, assuming the solar drawings have your updated electrical one line and show us what's. What's in there since this. This build out. 

**Allen, Walter:**
Yep, absolutely. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
So, yeah, send us that and then, you know, we'll take that data. So give me about a week, try to turn something around. Once I look at that, I'll let you know if. If I need to fly out there or not or if I have enough information to, you know, to be dangerous and get you what you need. 

**Allen, Walter:**
Yeah. If you could be, you know, confident enough to. To make that call, that will help me be able to commit because I, you know, I. I don't want us to run, you know, get into the project and then find out we got some, you know, additional cost because we didn't. We didn't see it, so. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, like I said, we'll get you, you know, your couple scenarios there of what it looks like and then do you. What do you want to do? You just want to. I don't know what your limit is. Where you need to get a POS is 25 grand underneath that, or. 

**Allen, Walter:**
What I would do is if, instead of cutting multiple POs, if we're all confident that we can make this happen, I just give you the PO for the whole thing. Um, but we would probably have to go through procurement because I think before, when we did it with you guys, we. When you did our Greenwood building, we had milestone payments. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yep. Yeah. Which you would do the same thing. We'll do like we're not. I'm not. We're not going to bill until obviously we're doing stuff right. 

**Allen, Walter:**
So we'd have to get, you know, the whole contract signed. But we are go from a budget standpoint at this point, unless you come back with something way out there, then I'll have to relook at it. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
No, I think knowing a little bit more of this data, I'm confident that we can be under that 3.3 in your budget. And ideally, again, we can bring it in even more knowing where we actually have to put the resources yeah, and. 

**Allen, Walter:**
To be honest, we've had a couple of vendors look at it, so we know where we're at kind of budgetary wise. So obviously we've done business with you before and you're familiar with our business. So, you know, it's a, it's a trust factor for me. Right. I want to go with somebody that I have high confidence in, even if it costs more. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah, totally, totally understand. So, yeah, send us that stuff. We'll go ahead and like I said, get the numbers crunched on it to make sure that you can hit the, the cooling capacity that you need. And yeah, go ahead. And, you know, I would encourage you to make that change. I'm curious to see what that will do to your, your facility. And even with, you know, with this build out, if you, you guys do have a building automation system, right? 

**Allen, Walter:**
I think there in that building. Yes. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah. So we'll, we'll want to, I'll be interested when we get into full design, looking at that and what it's set up at so that come July next year, we make sure that we're capitalizing on, you know, cooling at night, bringing that down. And I think that could, could really help you be more efficient too, and save some money in the long run. 

**Allen, Walter:**
From what I understand, though, I don't think they can do the cross ventilation at night because at my previous light, previous company, we, that's what we did. We were bringing the cool air at night. And when I proposed that to the building, they said they didn't have that capability. So. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah, you don't have cross ventilation in here. It doesn't look, I mean, you don't. Unless this isn't accurate. But what I was saying is, you know, they'll do the cross ventilation to. Because a lot of them, they don't have air conditioning, so they do the cross ventilation to cool it for you. It's just, you're gonna cool it with the units that you have. And then that way it's, it's slowly rising and you're taking again cold air and cooling. You know, you're taking 90 degree air and cooling it 20 degrees versus 110 and cooling at 20 degrees. 

**Allen, Walter:**
Right, right. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
So, but yeah, it's definitely worth, you know, see if you see a difference, you know, trying it that way. 

**Allen, Walter:**
Just one more question though. Just thinking through kind of next steps here. Are you, is Aledo an approved vendor of Alta, meaning that you guys did direct business with Alta? We have all that information because if not, I have to go through an approval process. On that piece too. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah, I mean, we should be. I'm assuming Kelly got a set up. I mean, I've got a invoice that should be paid in about a day and a half, so hopefully we're set up. 

**Allen, Walter:**
Okay, so. So when you guys did the work for Daleks, for example, that was probably subcontracted through another. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
We did two. So. We did two. So we did the. The subcontract work for Vargo for all the infrastructure, but then also Kelly had us do work for the building with the H VAC and system that was separate, so. Yeah. 

**Allen, Walter:**
Awesome. I think that would indicate to me, too, that you guys are set up, but I'll verify that and I'll work that behind the scenes. It's not a problem. It's just a tedious process. It takes a while to get. Get it all dirty. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah, I can look up here. Let's see here if I can find the P.O. but, yeah, I know. Yeah, I know that we have it because I. We've got the bill and everything. And I'll. I'll look through my email and see. But yeah, she sent us a PO or something, I believe. 

**Allen, Walter:**
So I can ask Kelly real quick or I can even have my team run. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Oh, perfect. 

**Allen, Walter:**
Check. Check with procurement, but we should be good. We can get that taken care of. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah, if you need something else, let me know. But I believe I. Like I said, we got everything set up. I mean, we did that work two months ago, so. 

**Allen, Walter:**
Okay. Okay, awesome. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Cool. All right, Walter. Well, we'll look for that and we'll get this thing knocked out and get you guys cooled down. 

**Allen, Walter:**
All right, so I'll get this information over to you. If you could just kind of give me an indication when you expect to get back to me, then we go from there. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yep, I'll look at it. And like I said, there should be a week. If it's longer, it would be less than two weeks. So I just. Once I wrap my head around the. The changes, then I'll give you a term date. 

**Allen, Walter:**
Okay, sounds good. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Thanks, Walter. All right, guys, see it here?
