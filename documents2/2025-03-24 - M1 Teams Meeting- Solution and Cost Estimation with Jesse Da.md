## Transcript
**Jdawson**: Jesse, you there?
**Jdawson**: Yes there.
**Jdawson**: I can hear.
**Alberto**: Morning.
**Jdawson**: Morning sir.
**Alberto**: Go on.
**Jdawson**: Morning.
**Jdawson**: Good good Good morning.
**Jdawson**: Everything good?
**Jdawson**: Good morning.
**Jdawson**: All right, good Good to meet with you this morning.
**Jdawson**: I, I.
**Jdawson**: We have one key member missing.
**Jdawson**: His name's Alberto.
**Jdawson**: He's actively working on the at the facility right now and on a project.
**Jdawson**: I was trying to bring him in but I could not.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So he asked maybe we just get a quick summary and, and get the to DOS for him after this meeting and, and go from there.
**Jdawson**: So a quick, a quick recap.
**Jdawson**: Well, let me do something really quick here.
**Joseph**: I'm gonna.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: Sorry about that.
**Jdawson**: I wanted to transcribe our meeting so we can go back and retrieve the notes for this.
**Jdawson**: So we met the first time you had some provided somewhat of a general project summary where you have, you have a project here in Florida that is kind of like a.
**Jdawson**: I would say a food plaza.
**Jdawson**: Food plaza with a few modules in there with kitchens that, that are going to sell various food anything other than food that were were so the ones.
**Alberto**: A couple of them they're calling bars.
**Alberto**: So they would be.
**Alberto**: Okay, more a bar.
**Joseph**: Okay.
**Alberto**: Yeah, just food bar.
**Alberto**: And let me pull this up.
**Alberto**: I'll share my screen.
**Jdawson**: Oh and I'm sorry while we get that quick, quick introduction, I went ahead of myself on the call.
**Jdawson**: We, we have Kimani, he's part of our sales team.
**Jdawson**: He's going to help support us on the sales effort and follow up with the the tasks on that side of the house.
**Jdawson**: And then we also have an on on the call Joseph who's on our construction team.
**Jdawson**: So any, any permitting or, or construction related questions, we can lean on him and if he doesn't have the answers, he'll reach out to the, the cost estimation team internally as well.
**Jdawson**: But sorry about that.
**Jdawson**: Go ahead, man.
**Alberto**: Oh, good to meet you.
**Alberto**: So this is the got the layout here and so this is going to be a stage that'll be a structural steel structure there for.
**Alberto**: There's a stage up here and covered seating.
**Alberto**: But got up here working out of a truck.
**Alberto**: So there's a little bit of a glare here.
**Alberto**: These are the container restrooms.
**Alberto**: And then there's another set of those restrooms I think over here.
**Alberto**: Yeah, that's 12, two.
**Alberto**: And then we got containers here and here here, here.
**Alberto**: Like all of these are the restaurant containers.
**Alberto**: Yes.
**Alberto**: They called this one here a container bar.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Joseph**: Okay.
**Alberto**: And then like here like these entrances, you know they're going to be similar.
**Alberto**: That Water's Edge project.
**Alberto**: I sent you guys some links too with pictures, you know, just a container looking thing at the entry.
**Alberto**: This 14, I think is a storage.
**Alberto**: You guys have this, correct?
**Jdawson**: I.
**Jdawson**: I believe we have it in our notes.
**Joseph**: Correct.
**Alberto**: So the office space and storage calls that one.
**Alberto**: One of them is a cooler, like a cold storage.
**Alberto**: They got a dry, good storage.
**Jdawson**: Now are those needing to be fabricated as well or will those be bought, you know, from a storage.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: I mean, I'm sorry, a refrigeration freezer company.
**Jdawson**: So you.
**Jdawson**: Those would be fabricated.
**Jdawson**: We did, we did a freezer, freezer refrigerator unit for a customer.
**Jdawson**: 40, 40 foot unit.
**Jdawson**: I can, if.
**Jdawson**: Let me see if I can get a hold of some pictures there on that one and send them over to you.
**Alberto**: But yes, and if you like, you just have an insulated box basically that you make.
**Alberto**: I mean they're.
**Alberto**: We just built a place here in Indianapolis called Crate Escapes and it's like a dog bar.
**Alberto**: And they just have the insulated walls that make up the cooler for their beer kegs.
**Alberto**: And then it's just basically like a split system.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Alberto**: With the condenser on the outside and the coil and fan on the inside.
**Alberto**: So I would say it's probably similar.
**Alberto**: I don't know if it's.
**Alberto**: They want it to be a freezer.
**Alberto**: It doesn't.
**Alberto**: It just says cooler.
**Alberto**: So.
**Alberto**: Okay, there's.
**Alberto**: They called one of these a coffee shop.
**Alberto**: They got one of them, you know, specialty bar, main bar and then the food park.
**Jdawson**: So now I know we had discussed, you know, these are labeled containers.
**Jdawson**: But you, you were, you were also, you wanted to look into the certified modular building, which basically, you know, meets all the Florida building codes.
**Jdawson**: Instead of using, contain, repurposed containers.
**Jdawson**: Correct.
**Jdawson**: Or are we still.
**Alberto**: Well, are you able to like, you know, I'm thinking for the restaurants and the, and the bars, even that maybe model.
**Alberto**: Like what is like a cost effective way of doing this is can you secure a container down so that it meets the code to hold it there?
**Alberto**: Or if you put any electrical or like if it's just a storage unit or an office, can you put the electrical in just a container?
**Jdawson**: Yes, that's what I was going to suggest.
**Jdawson**: So the items that are like storage, that don't need a certificate of occupancy.
**Jdawson**: Correct me if I'm wrong there, Joseph.
**Jdawson**: Those, I believe can be containers.
**Jdawson**: Now they can all be containers.
**Jdawson**: There's just some due diligence that needs to be there.
**Jdawson**: For one the city, when they hear the word container, they kind of like push back.
**Jdawson**: And there are some like, you Mentioned some cities that have these container like plazas implemented.
**Jdawson**: But those may have been implemented prior to some changes that occurred with municipalities in 2024.
**Jdawson**: So we'll need to kind of do our due diligences on, on, on that.
**Jdawson**: There's some customers that say yes, this municipality will allow the containers.
**Jdawson**: We run into some that, that say they don't.
**Jdawson**: And then those, those would be risk at risk because if you know, they move forward with the container and then when they're ready to put on the site they come to realize they need to get a lot permitting related permits.
**Jdawson**: So we'll need to do some due diligences on this one.
**Jdawson**: Hey Joseph, have you looked into any in Seminole County?
**Kimani**: In Seminole county, we sent a request out previously.
**Kimani**: I'll verify, I'll double check for that.
**Joseph**: Oh, okay.
**Jdawson**: But yeah, but with the certified units they're, you know, they're already certified with the state.
**Jdawson**: So they can basically be placed anywhere in the state of Florida.
**Jdawson**: Since they meet all codes and they have that insignia.
**Jdawson**: I mean they go through some, quite a bit of process just to get them certified.
**Jdawson**: You know there's, they're modular so we, we hire a third party company that's, that comes out and inspects them and inspects the engineer drawings that that come with those units.
**Jdawson**: But as far as containers they can be done but we just need to check due diligence is there.
**Jdawson**: We may need to build on site instead of build it in our facility.
**Alberto**: So what is the difference?
**Alberto**: Like what are we talking cost wise?
**Alberto**: And that's a big thing.
**Alberto**: I need to get the design released and I, I have to give them some idea of what these are going to cost.
**Jdawson**: Okay, I reached, when I reached out to our cost estimation team, they can give ballparks per square footage based on the type of unit it's going to be.
**Jdawson**: Let's say a kitchen there they can provide the square footage cost.
**Jdawson**: If it's just storage, they can provide square footage, custom storage, meaning they have electrical inside and lights.
**Jdawson**: They can provide the ballpark there.
**Jdawson**: But generally if you want exact cost there'd be follow ups where we need to know what is inside the units.
**Jdawson**: Now back to your question about the cost between a container and a modular system.
**Jdawson**: The last, the last I was told on that one was it's about 30% more than what a container is on a certified modular system and 30% more of, of the cost of what a container would be.
**Alberto**: Right.
**Alberto**: When you say a container you would just be providing a container with nothing in it.
**Jdawson**: No, with with the customizations in there.
**Jdawson**: Like if it's, if it's a kitchen, we'll provide the square footage cost of a kitchen unit.
**Alberto**: Okay.
**Alberto**: And it's 30% less than if you build it as a prefab.
**Jdawson**: No, if, if.
**Jdawson**: If we build it as a modular structure, A certified state of Florida's modular structure.
**Jdawson**: It's 30% more than if we were to build it as a container.
**Joseph**: I got you.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: But you know, with the modular structure, it's a better structure.
**Jdawson**: You know, you have your.
**Jdawson**: The steel is different.
**Jdawson**: You know, you don't have the container steel.
**Jdawson**: It's a more robust system.
**Jdawson**: More robust building.
**Jdawson**: Okay, I will, I have a link that I will send that kind of outlines the risks of using a container.
**Jdawson**: But you can use that as a list as noting what the difference between a modular system, certified modular system and a container build.
**Jdawson**: Custom container build.
**Jdawson**: So as.
**Jdawson**: Do we.
**Jdawson**: Or do you have an idea of the fixtures and what will entail each unit that is needed?
**Jdawson**: For example, a container bar.
**Jdawson**: Are you just looking for, you know, the, the, the inside to have electrical and flooring?
**Jdawson**: The bar doesn't really need much there as far as fixtures.
**Jdawson**: Let me see.
**Jdawson**: Maybe cabinetry.
**Jdawson**: Do you know if those have been defined yet by what have they had by a client?
**Alberto**: They have not.
**Alberto**: But I mean, it would just be a.
**Alberto**: I would think they're all just like a bar top and you know, sinks, a couple sinks or hand sink.
**Alberto**: I don't know how many.
**Alberto**: You know, they need something to wash glasses.
**Alberto**: I'm sure maybe they don't allow glasses on a area like this.
**Jdawson**: But we, I don't know if I, I believe we demons.
**Jdawson**: I, I demonstrated some.
**Jdawson**: A couple units that were bars or one bar unit for a customer.
**Jdawson**: Let me bring that one back up to see if, if you want a similar.
**Alberto**: Yeah, if you want to share, look at your screen.
**Joseph**: Yeah, let's see.
**Joseph**: Let me go my projects.
**Joseph**: This was cowgirl kitchen.
**Jdawson**: This one was a container build.
**Jdawson**: So here's the front.
**Jdawson**: This is the bar that she.
**Jdawson**: She wanted.
**Jdawson**: And this was the inside.
**Jdawson**: So inside they were just.
**Jdawson**: They had some plumbing, some drainage, and an AC in back of them.
**Jdawson**: And back of the unit is an AC unit.
**Jdawson**: So for this client, what we did was when she reached out to us, we had a meeting with her and she specified everything that she needed inside based on our questions to her.
**Jdawson**: We requested, okay, what kind of flooring would you like?
**Jdawson**: And she wanted epoxy kind of walls did you have.
**Jdawson**: She wanted FRP so that they can clean Them instead of drywalls.
**Jdawson**: She wanted a water heater.
**Jdawson**: This is a water heater.
**Jdawson**: And then she was going to put in her own appliances in there.
**Jdawson**: She was going to put in her own sink.
**Jdawson**: But we can also put in the appliances as well.
**Jdawson**: We just need to know what needs to go in there so that we can quote exactly what the client needs.
**Alberto**: Well, these guys have an account with a, with a appliance, like kitchen appliance equipment.
**Alberto**: So all we do is provide the rough ins and then they come in and all the sinks and coolers and.
**Jdawson**: Whatever else, what we did with this customer.
**Alberto**: So how much is this a square foot and is this an actual container?
**Jdawson**: This is actually.
**Jdawson**: This is an actual container.
**Jdawson**: I.
**Jdawson**: I don't know what the square footage cost on this one off the top of my head.
**Jdawson**: I'll need to look for it, but I can for the bars.
**Jdawson**: Would this be a good sample of providing that ballpark estimate for you?
**Alberto**: Yeah, because it looks like they just have a bunch of outdoor seating.
**Alberto**: People just be coming up here getting their drink or their servers.
**Alberto**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Right now we're, we're currently building a concession stand for, for Miami Dade College, which looks like that one, but it, that one is just concession stand.
**Jdawson**: We haven't completed it yet, but I can provide.
**Joseph**: You.
**Joseph**: Let me see.
**Joseph**: Ltg.
**Joseph**: Oh, let me see if I can get some.
**Joseph**: All right, let's.
**Joseph**: Let's try this one.
**Jdawson**: This is also a container unit for Miami Dade College that we're doing.
**Alberto**: 20 foot.
**Joseph**: That's a 20 foot, correct?
**Jdawson**: Yes, that's in pro.
**Jdawson**: These are in progress photos I was trying to show you.
**Jdawson**: Okay, maybe this one's better.
**Jdawson**: We're not done with it.
**Jdawson**: We haven't closed it up yet because we're still going through some inspections with this unit.
**Jdawson**: But this is another sample of a concession stand that we're doing now.
**Jdawson**: It doesn't have kitchen in there.
**Jdawson**: What they're doing is just basically using microwaves to heat up hot dogs and that sort of stuff.
**Jdawson**: There's no hood system in there.
**Jdawson**: There's no fryer.
**Jdawson**: But this is another basic unit that's a container.
**Jdawson**: And then the modular units are units that we build from scratch.
**Jdawson**: So let me, let me.
**Jdawson**: We just sent out three offices for the University of Florida.
**Joseph**: Do this.
**Joseph**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: If I can capture it better.
**Joseph**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: This is, this is the office being delivered.
**Jdawson**: But you notice it looks like a container, but it's not.
**Jdawson**: It was a built from the bottom up modular certified unit.
**Jdawson**: So this, this office can go anywhere in the state of Florida.
**Jdawson**: And it'll pass permitting.
**Jdawson**: All, all it needs is, you know, the site plan be submitted to the municipalities and then the engineer drawings submitted and the permitting should just go seamless.
**Jdawson**: Right, right.
**Jdawson**: And this was inspected in house during the build and certified by a third party company.
**Jdawson**: So it's not an on site built.
**Jdawson**: Like if it was, it were to be a container in order to permit it.
**Jdawson**: Some counties they require inspect.
**Jdawson**: Like just as if you were to build a house, if you were to implement a container, you would have to have it inspected, you know, during the, the roughens, you know, before you close the walls.
**Jdawson**: So there's a, it's a different process, but the certified unit is more seamless, easier to go through.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Alberto**: So, so again like pricing.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, so what I'll do, what I'll do to take back.
**Jdawson**: As a take back, I'm gonna go without ask Alberto to give me the cost estimations per the type of units that you want implemented.
**Jdawson**: And they were part of that, that document that you showed me.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, and, and note that those cost estimate, the square footage costs are going to be on the high end.
**Jdawson**: We don't want to make them low because we found that if, if we do them low, there are sometimes costs there that the client, you know, would want additional stuff and then it becomes like, you know, but you told us so those, those square foot estimate estimates we're gonna, we provide are a little bit on the higher end, not the mid, but on the higher end just to cover any unexpected cost that a client requires as far as their build.
**Jdawson**: Once we get the actual fixtures, what type of flooring, all those, we put them into an estimate and that's when you would get the more accurate numbers.
**Alberto**: And.
**Alberto**: Okay, and when you say higher end, like what's that swag?
**Jdawson**: Let's say, let's say there's a hood system that's needed.
**Jdawson**: You know, there's different ranges and prices for the hood system.
**Jdawson**: You know, the things that go under over the fryers or you know.
**Alberto**: Yeah, well, like how much is it to add at range hood?
**Alberto**: That's easy.
**Alberto**: I mean instead of just blowing them all out of the water in price, can you say here's a normal restaurant container, add in a hood, it's you know, this much more or I mean, I don't know what else they would add, but at least then we could add those in ourselves and say like so many restaurants is this much.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I'll ask, I'll take that back.
**Jdawson**: As a studio with Alberto.
**Alberto**: Dan, I might.
**Alberto**: Will I be able to get some info today, because I really want to get the design going today, and I need this info to kind of finalize that.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, let me.
**Jdawson**: Let me talk.
**Jdawson**: Let me check with Alberto again.
**Jdawson**: He got pulled away into a project that he was needed.
**Jdawson**: Let me see his availability on.
**Jdawson**: On creating a cost estimate per square footage on.
**Jdawson**: On the buildings that you displayed on your screen.
**Jdawson**: Restrooms, kitchens, storage, office.
**Alberto**: And then obviously, if it's just decorative, like the container at the entries, you know, that's just simply because there's not going to be anyone in them.
**Alberto**: It's just for looks.
**Alberto**: It would just be.
**Jdawson**: Mural.
**Jdawson**: Is it trying to.
**Jdawson**: I'm trying to recall what the.
**Jdawson**: The term there is.
**Jdawson**: Can you help me out, Joseph?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, he's still there.
**Jdawson**: Yes, sir.
**Kimani**: So placed in those splash blocks.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jdawson**: You know, those placing containers more for.
**Joseph**: For artwork.
**Joseph**: Are.
**Jdawson**: Are those mural structures?
**Jdawson**: What's the technical term for those?
**Kimani**: I mean, if they are some kind of.
**Kimani**: They're more of like a monument sign, depending on their placement and where they're at.
**Joseph**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Monument signs.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: That's.
**Jdawson**: That's.
**Jdawson**: That's the one I was trying to re.
**Jdawson**: Remember.
**Jdawson**: I think that it's the same thing that we did with True Health.
**Jdawson**: Okay, well, let me take this back, Jesse, and see.
**Jdawson**: See what I can do on getting these today for you.
**Alberto**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And.
**Jdawson**: And.
**Jdawson**: And if.
**Jdawson**: And if Alberto wants a.
**Jdawson**: A followup, because I.
**Jdawson**: I know he needed to be in this meeting.
**Jdawson**: Are you available today or tomorrow if he needs.
**Jdawson**: If he needs to request a meeting from you?
**Joseph**: Oh, hey.
**Jdawson**: Are you there, Jesse?
**Alberto**: Oh, I'm here.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Alberto**: I'm available.
**Alberto**: I thought you were asking if he was.
**Jdawson**: Oh, no.
**Jdawson**: If he needs more information, are you available to.
**Alberto**: Oh, yeah.
**Joseph**: Okay.
**Alberto**: You got my cell phone.
**Alberto**: Just call me or text me if I'm not.
**Alberto**: I have several meetings today after this, but I think I'll go.
**Jdawson**: I'll go with email and text as primary.
**Jdawson**: And if.
**Jdawson**: If I can, I'll give you a call.
**Alberto**: Yeah, text me for sure, because I don't.
**Alberto**: I'm out.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Alberto**: Looking at some job sites today, so.
**Jdawson**: Sounds good.
**Kimani**: One thing to help Alberto.
**Kimani**: Do we happen to have a list of each one of the containers with how many windows and doors?
**Kimani**: What kind of windows and doors are going to be put in there?
**Jdawson**: That's what we don't.
**Alberto**: So that would.
**Alberto**: So each of them will be kind of.
**Alberto**: That's why I sent that water's edge, like.
**Alberto**: Yes, they'll probably, you know, it's all going to be restaurant vendors, so they'll have kind of like in your picture where the, the, you know they got the opening thing that kicks up.
**Kimani**: Yeah.
**Kimani**: Yes.
**Alberto**: And then the side door.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, One man door and two pop up windows.
**Alberto**: Yeah.
**Alberto**: And you have photos I sent you handy.
**Alberto**: Oh yeah, from the water's edge.
**Jdawson**: I was about to bring those up.
**Kimani**: Thank you.
**Alberto**: Yeah.
**Alberto**: So like that's it.
**Alberto**: Like a big service window, some lights over it and then a door to get in, to get behind there.
**Kimani**: Awesome.
**Kimani**: Is that just, is it on the side?
**Kimani**: So replacing the ISO doors and putting a one man entry exit on that side or are we keeping the ISO doors and on the other end we're going to put the one man door.
**Joseph**: This is important.
**Alberto**: I think it would be.
**Alberto**: Yeah, it would make sense to me to leave the doors that are on there and just close them in and then the other side put the man door in the solid side.
**Joseph**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Or if this is just a modular system, they'll both be, you know, we won't have the, the container doors, it'll just be a metal sheet there.
**Jdawson**: But one door would have to be a man door.
**Jdawson**: And I think this is a, an ac.
**Jdawson**: A barred ac.
**Jdawson**: Is this another unit here?
**Jdawson**: I think this is the AC unit here.
**Alberto**: Yeah, I think you're typical.
**Alberto**: Just, you know, the side units that go on a container.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, these are barred units.
**Jdawson**: These are the, the bigger AC systems.
**Jdawson**: So in, in the, in these units are you wanting to replicate like this barred H vac unit?
**Jdawson**: These are the more expensive ones or.
**Alberto**: What is the cheaper ones?
**Alberto**: The mini split.
**Jdawson**: Mini split?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Alberto**: Where do they put the condenser?
**Alberto**: Do you put it up on the roof.
**Jdawson**: For this one?
**Jdawson**: I believe it's all.
**Alberto**: Well that's self contained.
**Alberto**: But if it's a mini split, do they, do they sit on the top of the units or not?
**Alberto**: Do you have to find space on the ground for them?
**Jdawson**: I think they're within the unit.
**Jdawson**: They're within the unit.
**Alberto**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Joseph, the mini splits.
**Kimani**: Whether the condenser can sit on the unit or it's got to sit on its own pad.
**Jdawson**: Sorry, I cut out for the mini splits.
**Jdawson**: I believe those are within the system.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: The condenser.
**Alberto**: This is like a package unit.
**Alberto**: The mini split will have a condenser and then the fan coil on the inside.
**Jdawson**: I believe this unit is $4,000.
**Jdawson**: So this would be on the higher.
**Alberto**: End versus the other ones are two grand or less.
**Jdawson**: I believe so I need to, I'll check on with the cost estimation team on that one.
**Alberto**: Okay.
**Kimani**: What about lighting on the inside?
**Kimani**: It's just simple can lighting.
**Kimani**: Recess.
**Alberto**: Yeah, simple.
**Alberto**: Or they could even, I would think the like a two by or a four foot long strip light fixture.
**Alberto**: Maybe a couple of those along the middle.
**Alberto**: I wouldn't think they'd want can lights in there.
**Joseph**: Show you lighting here.
**Joseph**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Here.
**Jdawson**: So these type of lightings.
**Alberto**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: This is just a regular storage unit with a spring foam for those.
**Alberto**: Trying to see.
**Alberto**: Is that.
**Alberto**: So the lights are those square things?
**Jdawson**: Yes, these are the lighting.
**Jdawson**: And then on the outside you have your electrical box.
**Jdawson**: This is a unit we did for school.
**Jdawson**: It's just.
**Jdawson**: They just wanted a storage unit with a roll up door on the side.
**Jdawson**: There was one project that were.
**Jdawson**: Or initially we're in the starting phase.
**Joseph**: I want to show you here.
**Jdawson**: We did renderings for trying to find the final versions here.
**Joseph**: There.
**Jdawson**: Here we go.
**Jdawson**: So these, this is kind of an eating area.
**Jdawson**: And then the containers, there's some concession stands in here.
**Jdawson**: And then they have a stage here and they have some bars underneath here.
**Jdawson**: This is a concept that he brought to us.
**Jdawson**: Maybe this is a little bit better.
**Jdawson**: But these down here were all going to be food.
**Jdawson**: Food units.
**Jdawson**: And then the second story here we're going to be envisioned like barbers and salons and you know, offices for them, but all made out of a container.
**Jdawson**: Container park.
**Joseph**: So there it goes.
**Jdawson**: So he had the stage up here and then down here the bars.
**Jdawson**: I just remember that we created this for him.
**Jdawson**: And pickleball courts all over the the area.
**Jdawson**: It's a big thing right now.
**Jdawson**: Pickleball.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Alberto**: Okay, well that's an important thing.
**Alberto**: Let's just price it.
**Jdawson**: Just.
**Alberto**: Just price the two different types square footage wise, like your normal container.
**Alberto**: And then like every time you add something, split system is standard with this.
**Alberto**: And then if you upgrade to these package units, then it's so much more.
**Alberto**: And then we can make quick decision, try and get an idea how much we're going to have it here.
**Alberto**: We can get our budget over to this owner.
**Jdawson**: Sounds good.
**Jdawson**: Let me work on that with Alberto and get you those.
**Jdawson**: Those numbers.
**Jdawson**: If, if you can, I have that document.
**Jdawson**: But if you could you send that again to me just to have it at the top of my email.
**Joseph**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: All right, Jesse, well, thanks again and you'll hear from us very soon.
**Alberto**: All right.
**Alberto**: I appreciate it.
**Jdawson**: Thank you.
**Jdawson**: Thanks Kiovani.
**Jdawson**: Thanks, Joseph.
