## Transcript
**Ataylor**: Hey, how are you guys?
**Masonaplumlee**: Hey, how are we doing?
**Ataylor**: Doing well, doing well.
**Ataylor**: Good to meet you.
**Masonaplumlee**: Nice to finally meet you.
**Masonaplumlee**: Tom had a lot of good things to say.
**Ataylor**: Thanks, I appreciate that.
**Ataylor**: He's, he's been a good friend.
**Masonaplumlee**: He's.
**Masonaplumlee**: He's an awesome guy.
**Masonaplumlee**: One of, one of a kind.
**Ataylor**: For sure, for sure, for sure.
**Ataylor**: Well, I don't, I don't know how much like, you know, I was just, I was on your guy's website a little bit and I, I appreciate the introduction, but just so you know, kind of why I reached out to him and what I was looking for.
**Ataylor**: My, My parents retired to Indianapolis and I have a bunch of stuff in storage up in Warsaw, Indiana.
**Ataylor**: So I'm like looking to get something that down in and around Indianapolis area.
**Ataylor**: So I actually asked them, I was like, hey, do you know any brokers or anybody that you know would have kind of like a 1500-2500 square foot space?
**Ataylor**: You know, already billed that I could either repurpose or whatever.
**Ataylor**: So I didn't.
**Ataylor**: You know, I appreciate that you guys are GCs and you build stuff yourself, but I, I don't know if there's a direct connection here, but just, just wanted to be transparent and respect your guys time because I, I likely wouldn't if I was going to like build.
**Ataylor**: To build something.
**Ataylor**: It'd probably be more like a barn dominium or something.
**Masonaplumlee**: Yeah, yeah.
**Masonaplumlee**: Aj, you, you probably have more information on your end of things with that kind of looking for something for him then.
**Ericasosa78**: Yeah.
**Ericasosa78**: Hey, Mason.
**Ericasosa78**: Nice to meet you.
**Ericasosa78**: Yeah.
**Ericasosa78**: So that, that was why we wanted to hop on a call for sure.
**Ericasosa78**: Because I know Andrea briefly mentioned to me that you were looking for basically 3.
**Ericasosa78**: 3000 square foot of storage.
**Ericasosa78**: It sounds like, or from, from what I just heard, 15 to 2500.
**Ericasosa78**: And it would definitely be cheaper to find an existing space.
**Ericasosa78**: Right.
**Ericasosa78**: That you could store this in.
**Ericasosa78**: I, I actually have my broker's license now.
**Ericasosa78**: I don't really practice, but I have a lot of connections and so if you, if you kind of give me a rundown of exactly what you're looking for, like the general area, I can, I can connect you with some brokers and we can start looking at that and we can also look at, if it makes sense, you know, we can maybe throw a budget together and if you find a plot of land in an area that you really like.
**Ericasosa78**: Yeah, I know we don't any type of barndominium that's usually more residential, but I, I come from a residential background.
**Ericasosa78**: We can Definitely help steer you and in the right direction if it doesn't make sense for us to help with the build.
**Ataylor**: Gotcha.
**Ericasosa78**: So we're here to help, you know, without having too much information going into it.
**Ericasosa78**: That's why we wanted to chat real quick.
**Ataylor**: So.
**Ataylor**: No, I certainly appreciate it.
**Ataylor**: And again, like I, I just wanted.
**Ataylor**: I.
**Ataylor**: I actually reached out to Tom for a broker specifically.
**Ataylor**: So when he entered like, hey, you can.
**Ataylor**: You came with the sledgehammer.
**Ataylor**: I'm just looking for.
**Masonaplumlee**: That can be Tom.
**Masonaplumlee**: Tom likes to jump.
**Masonaplumlee**: Jump the gun sometimes, doesn't he, buddy?
**Masonaplumlee**: Always had a good faith and yeah, we're.
**Masonaplumlee**: We're happy.
**Ericasosa78**: Anyway, can we start with like, what.
**Ericasosa78**: What area are you looking for?
**Ataylor**: So my parents, they retired to Westfield.
**Ataylor**: I want to say.
**Ataylor**: Oh, sorry, my teammate.
**Ataylor**: Just text me you're good.
**Ataylor**: The.
**Ataylor**: So yeah, close to Westfield actually let me get the exact address for you and the like, like if I would say a 15, 20 minute drive from there.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: So like happy to.
**Ataylor**: To drive a little bit.
**Ataylor**: I'm looking to store like a couple cars and a lot of furniture.
**Ataylor**: That's.
**Ataylor**: That's pretty much it.
**Ataylor**: And, and I just get tired.
**Ataylor**: Like I have like those self storage things.
**Ataylor**: I have like probably like three or four of them between me and my siblings and my parents.
**Ataylor**: So it's just like getting everything under one roof.
**Ataylor**: Like definitely want like climate controlled and, and something secure.
**Ericasosa78**: Climate controlled.
**Ericasosa78**: Secure.
**Ericasosa78**: You know, I, I've built these barn Domini or not.
**Ericasosa78**: I built.
**Ericasosa78**: We called them storage condos.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ericasosa78**: And what it is.
**Ericasosa78**: And there's a development actually in Westfield that may have availability.
**Ericasosa78**: It was a project I was looking at.
**Ericasosa78**: It would have been years ago, but these were cool concepts because you could pull in a bunch of cars and then they'd have like a loft.
**Ericasosa78**: And are you looking for something that has like a livable space where you can go hang out?
**Ericasosa78**: Because people would store their RVs and then go to the lake and stuff like that.
**Ericasosa78**: Yeah.
**Ericasosa78**: Are you just looking for storage?
**Ataylor**: Well, I would say it would be cool.
**Ataylor**: Like the reason I want more space is because like a lot of this would be like, like I'm trying to think.
**Ataylor**: I.
**Ataylor**: No one needs to stay the night there.
**Ataylor**: But if you can have an office and do some work and have wi fi.
**Ataylor**: Like I do a lot of furniture reselling.
**Ataylor**: Reselling.
**Ataylor**: So like to be able to put up a white backdrop and do the photos and like, like that would be great.
**Ataylor**: But.
**Ataylor**: But yeah, like I would say one or two cars and then you know, know kind of studio Space and then a lot of storage.
**Ataylor**: Like because you know how it is.
**Ataylor**: Like with those self storage units, like stuff is so like you have to move it all.
**Ataylor**: It's just hard to get to things.
**Ataylor**: So like to people like it out and access without it being like, oh gosh, we got to get to the back of the unit again.
**Masonaplumlee**: Playing Tetris every time you're going in.
**Ataylor**: Exactly, exactly that.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: The con.
**Ataylor**: What.
**Ataylor**: What did you call that?
**Ataylor**: The condo storage.
**Ericasosa78**: We called them storage condos.
**Ericasosa78**: I built a couple like self storage places.
**Ericasosa78**: This one in particular, we call them storage condos because you could actually either buy the condo itself and you actually owned it or you could rent it.
**Ericasosa78**: Depend on what the developer wanted to do.
**Ericasosa78**: And I can send you a link to that area.
**Ericasosa78**: It may make sense.
**Ericasosa78**: I mean if they have one available, it may be exactly what you want.
**Ericasosa78**: Obviously it's in a community so you'd have other people around sharing entrances with you.
**Ericasosa78**: But the unit is yours in and itself.
**Ataylor**: That's amazing.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: I don't worry so much about.
**Ataylor**: I'm.
**Ataylor**: To me, I actually feel more secure with having more people around.
**Ataylor**: But what I don't want is a monthly payment for the next 20 years.
**Ataylor**: Like I'd rather.
**Ataylor**: Here's a.
**Ataylor**: Here's 7, 500 grand.
**Ataylor**: Like let me put my stuff in here.
**Ericasosa78**: Yeah, no, that, that, that, that helps a lot narrow it down too because I'm not.
**Ericasosa78**: I forget if this place is rent only or you can actually buy them.
**Ericasosa78**: So I'll do some digging on that for you.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: If you find that.
**Ataylor**: And like obviously would happy to sign the broker agreement or whatever if you can find something for me.
**Ericasosa78**: Yeah, I'd have to think of like which one of my connections would be a good.
**Ericasosa78**: I mean one comes off the top of my head.
**Ericasosa78**: He's at Aloe Property Group and I can introduce you to him.
**Ericasosa78**: But I think a good starting point, I mean this is.
**Ericasosa78**: Well, if you.
**Ataylor**: If you got your license and you find I'm happy to pay you.
**Ataylor**: Like, you know, it doesn't.
**Ericasosa78**: Yeah, yeah, that works too.
**Ericasosa78**: I mean I, I have to funnel it through.
**Ericasosa78**: The way it works is someone holds your license so you have to funnel it through a certain person.
**Ericasosa78**: So really I'm just.
**Ericasosa78**: I'm in referral mode.
**Ericasosa78**: So I would see what we would want to do as far as Alito goes, how that would work.
**Ericasosa78**: And I've only done it a few times.
**Ericasosa78**: I do it.
**Ericasosa78**: I use it for like friends.
**Ataylor**: That.
**Ericasosa78**: That's a lot of time.
**Ericasosa78**: I don't Use it much.
**Ericasosa78**: I'm.
**Ericasosa78**: I'm way more involved in the development and the actual construction side of things when it comes to these.
**Ericasosa78**: Not the actual, I guess you call, you know, art of the deal.
**Ericasosa78**: So figure out who I would.
**Ericasosa78**: Would want to recommend or bring in.
**Ericasosa78**: But like I said, if.
**Ericasosa78**: I'll do some digging on these storage condos in Westfield and I'll send you the link and I'll even make the call for you, Mason, and just see what.
**Ericasosa78**: What those entail.
**Ericasosa78**: And if those aren't the right route, then we can start potentially looking at land.
**Ericasosa78**: I mean, if you're.
**Ericasosa78**: Do you have a budget?
**Ericasosa78**: What's your budget?
**Ataylor**: 100 grand or so.
**Ericasosa78**: I got 100 grand or so.
**Ericasosa78**: Okay.
**Ericasosa78**: Yeah, that helps because if we have a budget to work with, maybe it makes more sense if we can build you something.
**Ericasosa78**: I.
**Ericasosa78**: I don't know.
**Ericasosa78**: Granted, you'd have to buy the land too, so.
**Ericasosa78**: And land is.
**Ericasosa78**: You can't find land for under a hundred grand in Westfield, I'll tell you that now, especially Hamilton county with how much it's growing.
**Ericasosa78**: So definitely would be probably more worth your while to buy an existing structure.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, that's what I was like finding something that's already got bones and then if I want to put something into it, sure.
**Ataylor**: But I don't love the idea of going ground up.
**Ericasosa78**: Yeah, yeah, no, I.
**Ericasosa78**: I hear you there.
**Ericasosa78**: I mean, it's.
**Ericasosa78**: It's going to be more than 100 grand if you do ground up.
**Ericasosa78**: Unless it's like a.
**Ericasosa78**: A pole barn type thing.
**Ericasosa78**: So.
**Masonaplumlee**: Yeah, there's a place called Motor.
**Masonaplumlee**: Motor District Garage.
**Ericasosa78**: It's the one I'm talking about.
**Masonaplumlee**: Andrew, that's probably what you're thinking of.
**Ericasosa78**: Yeah, the one I'm talking about.
**Ericasosa78**: Yeah, They've been talking about building that for a while and they finally did.
**Ericasosa78**: And there's another one that.
**Ericasosa78**: There's another one, actually that a competitor built of ours who's a friend of mine that I can check out too.
**Ericasosa78**: Mason.
**Ericasosa78**: Okay, but is there any other info, like, pertinent info you think we need to know or.
**Ataylor**: No, I think that that's pretty much it.
**Ericasosa78**: What's your timeline?
**Ataylor**: I mean, there's no rush.
**Ataylor**: Like I'm.
**Ataylor**: I'd like to get it done this summer, but that's.
**Ataylor**: That's about it.
**Ericasosa78**: So you're not living in Indy, are you?
**Ericasosa78**: You said it's your parents.
**Ataylor**: I'm not.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, I live.
**Ataylor**: I based in Chicago in the summer, and then I.
**Ataylor**: I play in Phoenix, so I'm mostly in Phoenix.
**Ericasosa78**: Oh, I know.
