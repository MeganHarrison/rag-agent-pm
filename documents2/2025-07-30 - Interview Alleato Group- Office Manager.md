**Jdawson**: And I recently hired someone to be full time.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: So I just manage the projects and everything right now, part time.
**Jdawson**: And I'm looking for another job.
**Jdawson**: So as I was looking for another job, Jesse reached out to me not too long ago and I was like, of course, I'll check it out.
**Jdawson**: Of course.

**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Gotcha.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Okay, and so you graduated high school and then you, you know, you pretty much went and worked at Valor right away.
**Jdawson**: I graduated high school, I actually lived in Hawaii for a year.
**Jdawson**: But I was mainly like taking that gap year to fully travel, see what I like, see what I don't like.
**Jdawson**: And then by the time I moved back to Florida, I went to work for Val.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Why Hawaii?
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: I mean, if you grew up in Florida, there's not.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: I mean, it's not a lot of difference.
**Jdawson**: Hawaii, I mainly moved there for a relationship I was in and then I just ended up succeeding over there.
**Jdawson**: And I was like, okay, it's the beach life.
**Jdawson**: I worked at a daycare, so I was like with kids all the time.
**Jdawson**: And on the side I was like getting into sales.
**Jdawson**: And I found out it was like a pyramid scheme.
**Jdawson**: Signed it up, not pursuing that.
**Jdawson**: So then I.
**Jdawson**: But I learned a lot.
**Jdawson**: I got licensed and now I'm here.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: What, what island did you live on?
**Jdawson**: Oahu.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Nice.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: You surf?
**Jdawson**: Beautiful island.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Did you try surfing?
**Jdawson**: I actually didn't try surfing.
**Jdawson**: I did everything but surfing.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Oh man, that's the fun stuff.
**Jdawson**: I was a little shy to surf and I didn't have those friends that pushed me to do it, so.
**Jdawson**: But there's always time to learn, right?
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Okay, so you got like, you know, Microsoft Office, you know, in suite, you know, and then the rest of that stuff is just, you know, normal shit.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: What about like, do you know anything about AI?
**Jdawson**: Into which regards you tell me.
**Jdawson**: So all I know about AI is I'm like really good at the re.
**Jdawson**: At the researching and then also using certain AIs for certain formulas, depending on like certain projects.
**Jdawson**: But as of like for marketing, as in like designing.
**Jdawson**: I'm really good at AI researching, but I'm, I'm not.
**Jdawson**: That's like what I'm good at.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Like what do you use?
**Jdawson**: What AI?
**Jdawson**: I mainly just use Canva.
**Jdawson**: Use like Chat, CBT and a couple others for schools.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Okay.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Are you at school now?
**Jdawson**: I'm currently not, no.
**Jdawson**: I usually just, I've been just collecting certificates.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Gotcha.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Okay.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: And so what about any other softwares?
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Like you know, you said Canva.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: What about like Adobe or like Notion or you know, whatever.
**Jdawson**: I've touched a little bit in Notion and Adobe but I haven't used it for a year now.
**Jdawson**: I would just need a little refresher and then I also am really good at mainly just Excel and then also any Google related and also Microsoft Teams and everything in this area.
**Jdawson**: LinkedIn and then also HubSpot and mainly those softwares.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So you said you're getting certificates.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: What certificates are you getting?
**Jdawson**: Right now I'm working for technology certificates and also more certificates in Excel.
**Jdawson**: I'm working on how to make formulas because right now in Excel I'm just into data entry and that's all I have experience in.
**Jdawson**: But I'm not so experienced when it comes to creating formulas.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: I would think that if you needed a formula, like, I mean what I always do is I literally just go into ChatGPT and like take a screenshot or like upload an Excel file and say, hey, how do I make a formula to do xyz?
**Jdawson**: Right?
**Jdawson**: I do do that as well.
**Jdawson**: I just want a certificate that proves to people like, oh hey, I know how to do this.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Gotcha.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Gotcha.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.

**Jdawson**: So right now I'm looking for.
**Jdawson**: I have a lot of experience in executive assistant and office management.
**Jdawson**: So right now I'm trying to be like just the best at that and pursue that for a couple years and then eventually like make my way up into marketing and then hopefully create a team, build from there, be able to do my own thing.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Maria, you got any marketing questions for?
**Bclymer**: I have more questions related to how do you manage like a very tight schedule?
**Bclymer**: You know, like for example, sometimes we have a lot of meetings to set up or sometimes we have, you know, different events at the same time.
**Bclymer**: So we have to do a lot of things.
**Bclymer**: So how do you manage, how do you organize your day?
**Bclymer**: You know, how do you prioritize all those things too?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I'll just go off based off my experience.
**Jdawson**: So I really like to have everything organized either Google, Microsoft, I like to have like a shared calendar and then also a set reminders and also a list of day to day tasks and also things to touch base off like weekly or monthly.
**Jdawson**: And I like to just have everything written down and also everything shared, everything coordinated between everyone just so everyone's on the same page as well.
**Jdawson**: So when it comes to like a day to day, I like to make sure the emails are sent, everything's organized in Google.
**Jdawson**: Like at least that Google Calendar has all the set times, has all the set meetings.
**Jdawson**: So just based on day to day, month to month, I like to just follow up on that at least once a day either in the mornings and late afternoons.

**Jdawson**: I have no, I have not done anything myself yet individually.
**Bclymer**: So when you help them with designs is more like you as a designer making those like creating them by your.

**Jdawson**: I was just curious on like how you guys got started.
**Jdawson**: I wanted to hear that coming from you guys.
**Jdawson**: I did do some of my own research and then I was just curious like, also, like, what's a day to day look like for you guys?
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So I started the company back in 2022.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So I was a VP, another firm, and you know, broke off, started my own thing, you know, and then we opened up the Tampa office, like I think like a year ago, year and a half.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Ish.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: And then.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Yeah.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So we, you know, just grown steadily over the years.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: We're nationwide, you know, keep growing.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: I don't, you know, I don't, I don't know what other, you know, I guess that's kind of the gist of it, I just decided to just, you know, start my own thing as far as like day to day operations and what it looks like.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So, you know, everybody's broken up into different project teams, you know, depending on where they're at the country and whatnot.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: You know, typical day for, for me is, you know, I'm, you know, a lot of my days are spent in meetings for whatever.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: A lot of it is, you know, strategy, vision, like, you know, you know, marketing, back of house accounting and then you know, sales.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: That's my, my biggest thing too is bringing in work for the business and you know, strategic, you know, 10 year vision.
**Jdawson**: That's amazing.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Maria keeps me in line.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So maybe from.
**Bclymer**: Well, Brandon's day is every day different.
**Bclymer**: You know, like he have meetings and everything, but his day is completely different.
**Bclymer**: As executive assistant of him, he has a lot of meetings or organizing everything for him.
**Bclymer**: Sometimes we do have to rush into other things.
**Bclymer**: For example, we're working on like growing nationwide, like he's saying so with a lot of licenses.
**Bclymer**: So we need to, you know, you know, like kind of prioritize some things.
**Bclymer**: But the day to day is very different.
**Bclymer**: But every time we always have like, okay, what do we have to do for Brandon first in my case for Brandon.
**Bclymer**: And then another things comes up.
**Bclymer**: So for example, other employees also ask me things like, hey Maria, we need shirts, we need these.
**Bclymer**: I don't have these.
**Bclymer**: Can you help me with my social insurance?
**Bclymer**: We need to check payroll, we need to check these.
**Bclymer**: I need to talk to accounting.
**Bclymer**: I need to so kind of like there's different things, but always an organization of trying to check with the different departments and make sure everything is fine.
**Bclymer**: Also sometimes I help Jesse with some other stuff.
**Bclymer**: But the day to day is like that back and forth.
**Bclymer**: What do you need?
**Bclymer**: What do you need?
**Bclymer**: This is the done.
**Bclymer**: Make sure this is payment.
**Bclymer**: And as Brandon mentioned to you previously, we have Notion, which is our big database that's like our bible.
**Bclymer**: Amen.
**Bclymer**: So everything that is there, we follow it.
**Bclymer**: You know, so for example, a project, a deadline, even if we have events, even if we have something.
**Bclymer**: So everything has to be in notion and make sure everybody feels comfortable, you know, with doing that in notion, even accounting, you know, everything is there.
**Bclymer**: And then other than that we just teams to communicate different calls, different stuff.
**Bclymer**: And for the marketing side, we have another people helping us, you know, with creating an agency, creating some content and everything.
**Bclymer**: But we do need help from the team.
**Bclymer**: So sometimes I'm the person nudging Them like, hey, can you please send me this video?
**Bclymer**: Hey, we need these.
**Bclymer**: Hey Brandon, you need to record this.
**Bclymer**: Hey, do this.
**Bclymer**: So you might, might, might need that as well.
**Bclymer**: From the St. Peter office too, from the people too.
**Bclymer**: But that's the day to day.
**Bclymer**: Every day is different.
**Bclymer**: It's really fun, to be honest.
**Bclymer**: It's really good.
**Bclymer**: It's amazing.
**Bclymer**: But still there's a lot of things to do.
**Bclymer**: So we definitely need a really good organization and this needs to be done.
**Bclymer**: And as Brandon will say, you know, it needs to be done, doesn't matter how, but it needs to be done.
**Bclymer**: You know, if it's a priority, if it's a task, let's make it happen.
**Bclymer**: And that's how it is.
**Jdawson**: Well, thank you so much for informing me.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So the biggest thing I would say is, you know, we get paid off results.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: You know, you can work really, really hard and it doesn't really matter if you don't get anything done.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: I mean you can, you can run all day on a treadmill but you're not really going anywhere.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So you know, we have a saying here.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: We find a way to make it happen, right?
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So you don't just, you know, oh, I sent an email like that I'll lose my shit.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: You know, we have a result here, like to get things done.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: That's kind of a big driving force for us is that's what differentiates us is, you know, we always find a way to make it happen.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: You know, urgency is key, right.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: You know, if something's in your, in your court, like take care of it, you know, there's no reason to sit on it.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So that's kind of our thought process as we go into anything.
**Jdawson**: Amazing.
**Jdawson**: Awesome.
**Jdawson**: Well that's great.
**Jdawson**: I really, you guys seem like such a strong team.
**Jdawson**: I really admire that.
**Jdawson**: It's really great.
**Jdawson**: You guys seem really, really close.
**Jdawson**: I got to even go into the office to meet Jesse.
**Jdawson**: So he showed me the office.
**Jdawson**: He mentioned to me like what his day to day is like.
**Jdawson**: He told me about everybody and I kind of got the in depth of everything.
**Jdawson**: And I loved hearing your side, Maria, because it seems like it seems like a lot that's going on all at once and I'd love to help you with that.
**Bclymer**: Yes, of course.
**Bclymer**: And again, it's really fun.
**Bclymer**: Trust me.
**Bclymer**: I'm come from different industries, nothing about this.
**Bclymer**: And it's really good, really fun and amazing.
**Bclymer**: But yeah, and I think as Brandon said, we need also that extra mile, you know, sometimes like if they don't call, if you Call and they don't answer.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Email.
**Bclymer**: It didn't send an email.
**Bclymer**: Okay, let's keep calling.
**Bclymer**: Let's try to find a person on LinkedIn.
**Bclymer**: Let's try to make sure they have profile.
**Bclymer**: If they're not on LinkedIn, just go physically and knock on the door, you know, so we kind of like, you know, that type of extra mile to make things happen.
**Bclymer**: And of course I know you will be a great asset, you know, helping us to have everything organized for the simple office and then.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I mean if you feel comfortable with that and feel sometimes a pressure but sometimes like this is good and organization and everything that'll be good for you and definitely I will be, you know, help, you know, helping you and guiding you also as well.
**Bclymer**: How, how to do that.

**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And then also I do have one more question.
**Jdawson**: I just wanted to know for this office manager position, would there be other positions to grow at this company?
**Jdawson**: If I were to get like certificates or help out or go to college, would there be room to grow and advance in this company?
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Yeah, so I would, this is just what I would tell you.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: You know, I, we interview and hire people.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: I've never looked at somebody's college degree in any of that shit.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: It doesn't matter.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Right.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Like in the real world, none of that stuff Matters like you get paid off results, right?
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: And so when you can find a way to be more efficient and, you know, make the company more profitable, you're gonna move up.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: That's a fact.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: You know, so, you know, you, like, Maria has made herself indispensable, you know, we've, you know, reward her financially for that, you know, and she'll obviously, you know, keep moving up and everything.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: And, you know, it's kind of, it's your ticket as far as what you want to do.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So if you want to get into marketing, our marketing is continuing to grow.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: I'd like to cut out the third party that we use and bring it more in house.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: We don't necessarily have capacity for that right now as far as with everybody's so busy doing a million other things, but yeah, there's a ton of different things as we keep growing that we're going to need.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: It's just, you know, it's on you.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Like, if you tell me, hey, Brandon, like, you know, can I get a, you know, you're going to give me a $30,000 raise if I go and get, you know, some BS degree, then I'm going to tell you, like, well, what do you expect to learn from that degree?
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: And there's a way that you can learn it without going and spending that money, you know, that's, there's more efficient ways to learn.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Like, learning is not in college.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Learning is a life skill.
**Jdawson**: Right, I agree.
**Jdawson**: And I love your mindset.
**Jdawson**: I'm slowly teaching myself this every day.
**Jdawson**: And, and I can tell you guys are very strong people, strong minded people, well structured and I'd love to work for you guys.
**Jdawson**: I'd love to learn, I'd love to grow with you guys.
**Jdawson**: And I also would love to meet you guys in person.
**Jdawson**: I do know Maria lives in Colombia.
**Jdawson**: I have family that actually was just in Colombia.
**Jdawson**: My dad's born and raised.
**Jdawson**: He came here when he was 12.
**Jdawson**: But I'd love to meet you in person, Brandon.
**Jdawson**: And with Maria there on Zoom, I feel like I excel better with human interaction in person via than via Zoom, in my opinion as well.
**Jdawson**: I'm not the best at the Zoom.
**Jdawson**: I get a little shy.
**Jdawson**: But I would love to meet you guys in person.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Yeah, I mean, I, I travel back and forth.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: I just, We've got a grand opening up here Klein asked me to be here for, so I, you know, I have to be up here for that.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: But yes, I mean, I, you know, after that I'll be down in the St. Pete office, so.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Yeah, I go, like I said, back and forth as far as, you know, what's your, you know, timeline and salary expectations?
**Jdawson**: My salary expectations are around.
**Jdawson**: They're around like at least like 30 to at least like 30 an hour as like a minimum.
**Jdawson**: And then at the same time, I was going to ask, would this also be like an office manager and like executive assistant with like, also helping out with the task to help, like Jesse's calendar, everyone's calendar meeting.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Yeah, I mean, you know, as far as, like, you know, we don't put people in silos.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Right.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Like, that's not a thing, you know, you know, it's like, oh, hey, that's not in my job description is the fastest way to get fired.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: And so, you know, we're all pulling on the rope in the same direction.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Yeah, as far as like, you know, like again, like Maria, you know, was, you know, technically hired on as executive assistant, but she handles hr, you know, marketing, you know, risk management, you know, things like that.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Like, so she is, you know, become very valuable and is always willing to help and step up.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: And what she doesn't know, she learns.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Right.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So, yeah, so for you, I mean, yeah, you would probably be helping, you know, in whatever.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Right.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So like, if, you know Jesse, you know, at his age, you know, he.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: He's not as sharp as he is.
**Speaker 3**: 11 o' clock yet.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Yeah, see, I mean, I mean, look, you got to make sure he gets his.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: You've got to make sure he gets his noon cocktail, you know, things like that.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Like, so I was confused that I.
**Speaker 3**: Thought you were coming into the office.
**Speaker 3**: I was trying to get the conference room TV up and, you know, I just, I can only do one task at a time.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Yeah, see, you were there.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: He would, you would be like, okay, Jesse, you basically, like, think of like Joe Biden and how they guided him.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: That would be.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Oh, okay.
**Jdawson**: Got it.
**Jdawson**: I can easily manage that.
**Jdawson**: I. I'm very familiar with like, Nick and Candon as well and letting them know where to go and what to do too.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Yeah.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So, you know, as far as, like, managing, you know, everybody's calendar, like, no, like, I mean, like Maria, you know, she really only, you know, manages, you know, me and Jesse's calendars and really helps assist us, you know, like, obviously if people in the company need things.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: But as far as like, you know, day to day and stuff, like, you know, I put like, they better, you know, be able to manage their own stuff, you know, so that, that wouldn't be an expectation, you know, if somebody was you know, asking that of you or Maria, I would want to know very quickly and find out why.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: But, yeah, I mean, you know, a lot of it is like.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: I mean, like this.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: You see this?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: I got two more stacks over.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: I don't like to open and read mail.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: It's annoying to me.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: I want somebody to do that for me and figure out what's important and put it in front of me.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Yeah, I hate it.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: You know, I don't like doing it at all.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: You know, helping like.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Like this, like, see, I've got, you know, I've got a stack of checks here.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Like, I have to fold these, put them in envelopes, stamp them and send them out.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: I don't like doing it.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So things like that, that I don't like to do would, you know, definitely, you know, be something to take off my plate would be helpful.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: And then, yeah, a lot of this stuff is like, again, just day to day stuff.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Like a lot of our, you know, folders, you know, need to be organized and stuff, and it's just, it gets pushed down.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So there's a ton of stuff to go and improve on.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Like, you know, like I was going over with Maria, you know, this morning, like, our integration between Fireflies and Notion.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: There's something messed up with Zapier.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Like, she doesn't know how to fix it.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: I don't know how to fix it.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Like, we just got to kind of figure it out, right?
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: It's a lot of that kind of stuff is what I would expect, right?
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Like, there's nothing with the technology and the tools that we have in our hands, you know, like, I don't expect you to go build a building.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: That takes general knowledge.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Right?
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: But a lot of this stuff, you know, like, I could solve any of it if I just had time to sit down and look and figure it out.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Like, with, you know, using chat, the Internet resources, my brain, like, I could figure it out.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: And I would expect you or anybody else to do the same.
**Jdawson**: All right, well, I would love to help you out on everything.
**Jdawson**: I'm sure I'll have all the time to get everything done within a few hours.
**Jdawson**: It sounds like really fast things to get done, really easy things to get done.
**Jdawson**: I would love to, of course, meet you in person.
**Jdawson**: And then also I would be able to meet with you guys or start as soon as Friday.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Like in two days.
**Jdawson**: Two days.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Well, that won't happen.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: That's a little quick, I can tell you that.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: I don't think we can even get you signed up.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: That fast, but that's good to know that you could start immediately.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Cool.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Jesse, you have anything?
**Speaker 3**: No, I obviously missed the first half, so I don't know what you talked about, but.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, there's just so many things that are administrative that we just don't have time to do, so.
**Speaker 3**: That'd be good.
**Speaker 3**: And just getting everyone organized, you know, we got so many systems in place.
**Speaker 3**: An extra person to help remind people of things that we want to remind them of.
**Speaker 3**: Maria helping her out with everything she does.
**Speaker 3**: We'll make you a permanent expert, too, or GC license expert, too, so you can help her tackle all that stuff.
**Jdawson**: Looking forward to it.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Any.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Any last questions for us, Ashley?
**Jdawson**: I think you guys answered everything for me.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Awesome.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Well, it was great meeting you.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Thank you so much.
**Bclymer**: Thank you, guys.
