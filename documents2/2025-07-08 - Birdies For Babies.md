## Transcript
**Aalarson03**: Believe that.
**Ataylor**: Sorry.
**Eawente**: I'm not even looking at the camera.
**Eawente**: Is everybody in?
**Eawente**: I'm trying to do something else.
**Aalarson03**: What's for dinner?
**Ataylor**: Anna.
**Esherrill2018**: You'Re muted right now.
**Esherrill2018**: Anna, Anna, you're muted.
**Eawente**: Yep.
**Eawente**: Thank you.
**Gstrati16**: Sorry.
**Eawente**: I was answering your question, but I'm out in Denver right now.
**Eawente**: We have all of our interns out here, so we have 24 interns.
**Eawente**: So eating dinner with them out here.
**Aalarson03**: Awesome.
**Eawente**: I think we're just waiting on Lauren.
**Eawente**: I guess we can go ahead and start.
**Eawente**: I think she's joining.
**Eawente**: She texted me a little bit ago, so.
**Eawente**: All right.
**Eawente**: Start with first.
**Ataylor**: Quad.
**Eawente**: Anything for me?
**Lani.johnston1**: What would you like?
**Lani.johnston1**: I got the pullovers will be delivered with Mike.
**Lani.johnston1**: Supergatory.
**Lani.johnston1**: I did not ship them because it was like four boxes and he was going to be down there anyway.
**Lani.johnston1**: So I figured I'll have him take them.
**Lani.johnston1**: So he'll have them there by Thursday at 1 because they're playing at 2.
**Lani.johnston1**: And then signage will be shipped directly to the course.
**Lani.johnston1**: So Aaron will have all that.
**Lani.johnston1**: And I did put the dead ass last trophies in one of the boxes too.
**Aalarson03**: So you have those.
**Gstrati16**: Okay.
**Aalarson03**: I look forward to getting those again this year.
**Esherrill2018**: You might have some competition out there, Steve.
**Esherrill2018**: We know some not good golfers.
**Aalarson03**: The thing is, I'm not actually that bad.
**Aalarson03**: I just played that good at all last year.
**Gstrati16**: Okay.
**Eawente**: Can you send me final pairing sheet just so we can triple check it because the last one I have doesn't have everybody on it.
**Lani.johnston1**: Yep.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Eawente**: I think that's all I was gonna ask before.
**Esherrill2018**: I know there's one foursome.
**Esherrill2018**: It's the Chandler McKinney foursome.
**Esherrill2018**: That may like, he can't come.
**Esherrill2018**: Someone's gonna replace him.
**Esherrill2018**: I think when they show up that day, they're just gonna say, I'm gonna spore some and get that size shirt that he got.
**Eawente**: We are doing no more switching.
**Eawente**: Yeah.
**Eawente**: Yeah.
**Eawente**: Okay.
**Esherrill2018**: But is that okay that they just show up?
**Eawente**: I'm sending it to Aaron tomorrow.
**Eawente**: The cart.
**Eawente**: The cart.
**Eawente**: The foursomes are going on the carts.
**Eawente**: He's printing everything like, yes.
**Eawente**: If they show up, that's fine.
**Eawente**: They're just going to say, hey, I'm playing for so and so.
**Eawente**: And they're going to look for that person's name throughout the outing.
**Eawente**: Pullovers were no more switches.
**Gstrati16**: Okay.
**Eawente**: It's really hard to to track all these switches because we have a lot of different moving parts.
**Eawente**: I'm getting a little overwhelmed.
**Eawente**: I'm not gonna lie.
**Eawente**: So no more switches.
**Eawente**: Otherwise I think we're good.
**Eawente**: As long as I Get the final.
**Eawente**: You're gonna assign holes, right?
**Eawente**: Or they're probably already on there, Todd.
**Eawente**: Because the last one I have doesn't.
**Eawente**: It just has last names.
**Lani.johnston1**: Yeah, I. I just have to finish whole assignments.
**Lani.johnston1**: I. I did what I did the requests that we, you know, we talked about.
**Lani.johnston1**: But other than that, I just have to randomly assign the rest of them.
**Eawente**: Okay, perfect.
**Eawente**: Just want to make sure I didn't have to do that.
**Eawente**: Auction is up and running.
**Eawente**: Well, not up and running.
**Eawente**: It's in the process of getting up and running.
**Eawente**: I believe everybody should be getting an email probably tomorrow morning with just like, hey, this is who it is.
**Eawente**: It's hella funding or doing the silent auction.
**Eawente**: He's going to try to work on some verbiage to get people to sign up.
**Eawente**: A lot of times, I think Lonnie got some pushback, Aaron got some.
**Eawente**: Or Anna got some pushback last year with people being like, well, I'm not going to bid on anything.
**Eawente**: I don't want to sign up.
**Eawente**: And then they got out to the course and like, oh, I don't have cash.
**Eawente**: I want to put that on a card.
**Ataylor**: And so it's just.
**Eawente**: It was really kind of a mess to try to figure that out.
**Eawente**: So we're trying to streamline it this year where everybody puts a card down when they first come in.
**Eawente**: When everybody puts a card, everyone will try to put a card down when they first come in.
**Eawente**: Even if they aren't interested in silent auction, there's several other things for them to be able to use that for, especially if they don't have cash.
**Eawente**: So Lonnie and Anna, I'm doing my best to get all the phone numbers, and we have, like 85% in, which is, like, not great, but it's not near as what they were last year.
**Eawente**: I mean, last year I think we had, like, 30% or something crazy.
**Eawente**: So I will work on that.
**Eawente**: I sent you guys the kind of instruction video.
**Eawente**: I think it's pretty much the same thing as last year.
**Eawente**: You'll enter everything.
**Eawente**: You'll go in every in red or in check people in under the butler.
**Eawente**: Just like last year.
**Eawente**: That's going to kind of be your landing page.
**Eawente**: It'll prompt you, if they don't have a credit card, to ask for one.
**Eawente**: I'm gonna pick up new swipes tomorrow because I know ours weren't working very well last night or last time.
**Eawente**: All that's pretty much the same.
**Eawente**: Everybody's gonna get a bag this year, so I'll probably have a floater.
**Eawente**: Helping hand those out.
**Eawente**: They'll be labeled with their names.
**Eawente**: We'll have everything alphabetical.
**Eawente**: So grab them and go.
**Eawente**: No changing at.
**Eawente**: No changing sizes at that point.
**Eawente**: After golf, if somebody wants to come up afterwards and I have time to swap it out, we'll swap it out.
**Eawente**: But we're not even gonna mess with it, like, at that point, because then we get a crowd of people and then people are trying them on and people are taking them off, and then it's just.
**Eawente**: It's a mess.
**Eawente**: Lunches will be same place in the restaurant area.
**Eawente**: Nobody is supposed to.
**Eawente**: I'm really anal about this, and I know I sound like a not nice person right now.
**Eawente**: I'm really tired, to be honest.
**Eawente**: Stressed out.
**Eawente**: Nobody is to go into the banquet area before they eat, either on their golf cart or they eat in the restaurant.
**Eawente**: I'm a very big stickler on that.
**Eawente**: I opened it one time and there was crumbs everywhere.
**Eawente**: And so we were cleaning up and I'm really anal, and I do not want my guests to walk in and have crumbs all over the tables.
**Eawente**: So box lunches in the restaurant or to the golf carts.
**Eawente**: If people ask.
**Eawente**: Raffle tickets will be available in the hallway, as well as Tito's will be set up in the hallway for cocktails.
**Eawente**: They can grab whatever they want, get their raffle tickets ahead of time if they want, head out to the golf carts and get set up.
**Eawente**: Obviously, they can do driving range and all that jazz or not.
**Ataylor**: They can.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Eawente**: Putting range, range, driving range, whatever.
**Eawente**: Can't even talk.
**Eawente**: Putting green.
**Eawente**: Driving range.
**Eawente**: What questions do you have about check in?
**Eawente**: Anything?
**Eawente**: No, you'll have an alphabetized list.
**Eawente**: You'll have a pairings list.
**Eawente**: The butler.
**Eawente**: When you open it, there's a way to search now by.
**Eawente**: I'm going to enter everything.
**Eawente**: So it will show a number and a name.
**Eawente**: And so if somebody's like, I don't know where I'm at, or my name is so and so and.
**Eawente**: Or the I'm with.
**Eawente**: I'm with AJ's group, and that's all they give you, then you can type in AJ's name and it'll come up with everybody that's in AJ's foursome.
**Eawente**: So you can enter that way as well.
**Eawente**: There's just a lot of different, like, ways to check in if you can't find somebody this year.
**Eawente**: What else?
**Eawente**: I think that's it for check in.
**Eawente**: Probably about the same as last year.
**Eawente**: Volunteers.
**Eawente**: I have all those people listed out.
**Eawente**: I'll send you a volunteer Checklist, which gives a little rundown of their responsibilities and what time they can arrive.
**Eawente**: Most people are 10:30 to 11.
**Eawente**: And we'll go through more details.
**Eawente**: I'll go through more details with each person individually on, like, what their roles are that day and if they have any questions.
**Eawente**: The only thing I'm gonna need help with is the golf ball launcher.
**Eawente**: I have no idea how to do it, so.
**Gstrati16**: Todd.
**Ataylor**: Yep.
**Eawente**: And then I feel like that's it for volunteers.
**Eawente**: What do you mean?
**Eawente**: You go, please.
**Ataylor**: Huh?
**Eawente**: Find something or you can go to bed.
**Ataylor**: Thank you.
**Eawente**: What else, Lauren?
**Eawente**: Did I.
**Eawente**: Well, here's my question.
**Eawente**: Gina and Evan, the people that are photography sponsors, we usually put their logo on the everybody's photos.
**Gstrati16**: Okay.
**Eawente**: I know it's a family foundation or something, so I just want to make.
**Eawente**: It's not like a business, so it's a little different than normal.
**Eawente**: So I just want to make sure we want the logo on the photos correct or no, definitely.
**Eawente**: I mean, let me text my uncle.
**Eawente**: So it's my aunt's foundation.
**Eawente**: She passed away from cancer.
**Eawente**: So let me just text him real quick and make sure.
**Eawente**: But I think he's cool with it.
**Eawente**: I think he knew what it was.
**Gstrati16**: Okay.
**Eawente**: Let me just make sure I can.
**Gstrati16**: Do that right now.
**Gstrati16**: Okay.
**Eawente**: And then I'll send that to Lauren if they do.
**Eawente**: If they don't.
**Eawente**: Easy for you.
**Eawente**: Same thing for you, Lauren.
**Eawente**: Photos are the exact same sleeves.
**Ataylor**: That's it.
**Eawente**: When you can get there whenever you and Charlie feel it's appropriate.
**Gstrati16**: Okay.
**Laurenwakefield**: I think we should be able to get there between like 11:30 and 12.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Laurenwakefield**: Is how it's looking right now.
**Laurenwakefield**: And then the rest will take care of.
**Eawente**: So do you need any specific.
**Eawente**: You have a golf cart, obviously you will have a list of the four stamps you can check off as you go along.
**Eawente**: Do you need any specific instructions given to anybody or you're good?
**Laurenwakefield**: I should be good.
**Laurenwakefield**: I think last time was like, our best time doing it.
**Laurenwakefield**: So I think we're just going to do the same plan and, like, work our way backwards through the court or the court, the course.
**Laurenwakefield**: So as long as I have the list and a golf cart, we should be good.
**Gstrati16**: Okay.
**Eawente**: So we should be good there.
**Eawente**: Of course, we'll need to keep one.
**Eawente**: Tito's will need one.
**Eawente**: Lauren needs one, I need one.
**Eawente**: And then Gina will need one.
**Gstrati16**: So.
**Eawente**: So those are the people that absolutely have to have them.
**Eawente**: So if anybody else asks, friends, family, or whatnot, just make sure that there's at least four at all times.
**Lani.johnston1**: Whoever's Doing the launcher and the beat.
**Lani.johnston1**: The pro will need a cart, too, or at least a ride.
**Aalarson03**: In and out.
**Gstrati16**: Okay.
**Eawente**: Out to the course and then back.
**Eawente**: Right?
**Eawente**: You mean they're.
**Gstrati16**: They don't need to.
**Eawente**: Yeah.
**Eawente**: Yes.
**Eawente**: Steve, are you able to be there to help these people?
**Aalarson03**: I can get in and out wherever you want me to be.
**Gstrati16**: Okay.
**Eawente**: So if you.
**Aalarson03**: I. I just confirmed with Kristen.
**Aalarson03**: She said angel can do the launcher or volunteered to do the launcher.
**Gstrati16**: We have.
**Eawente**: They have volunteers to do it.
**Eawente**: I'll keep angel with me inside.
**Aalarson03**: I think she did it.
**Aalarson03**: I think she did it with Caitlin or Kristen last year.
**Eawente**: Okay.
**Eawente**: But to do it again.
**Eawente**: But I think I was gonna.
**Gstrati16**: Have our.
**Aalarson03**: This is when I.
**Aalarson03**: This is when I stay out of your way.
**Aalarson03**: So you just say, tell me when to where and where to be, what time.
**Eawente**: I just need you to be there so that you can help get the heavy stuff out to the course.
**Gstrati16**: So be.
**Eawente**: The pro needs a table and chairs.
**Eawente**: Tito's needs a table and chairs.
**Eawente**: Basically, anybody that's out on the course is going to have a table, chair, and probably most of them will have tents.
**Eawente**: So, Evan, I'll probably have you do that as well.
**Eawente**: You and Steve can kind of make sure those people can get out to where they need to get out in time and get help just loading and.
**Ataylor**: Setting up and stuff.
**Esherrill2018**: Absolutely.
**Eawente**: I think that should be good for that.
**Eawente**: What else?
**Eawente**: What questions do you have?
**Ataylor**: What?
**Lani.johnston1**: Nicole, did you check with the tables and chairs?
**Lani.johnston1**: Is Erin going to put those out or do they not do that?
**Eawente**: They don't have any extra.
**Eawente**: At least they didn't last.
**Lani.johnston1**: Okay.
**Lani.johnston1**: I couldn't remember.
**Eawente**: I think maybe they had one extra.
**Gstrati16**: But.
**Eawente**: Yeah, because we use so many inside.
**Eawente**: They don't have any.
**Eawente**: At least that's what they tell me.
**Eawente**: They don't have any extra.
**Eawente**: So I have everybody bring.
**Eawente**: I brought one for Tito's, I think.
**Eawente**: Is Liz on here?
**Eawente**: No, I can verify with Liz.
**Eawente**: I think Liz even brought some last year.
**Gstrati16**: But.
**Eawente**: Yeah, I might.
**Eawente**: I know Beat the Pro needs one, and Tito's needs one.
**Eawente**: Everybody else, anyone for the launcher?
**Eawente**: Not necessarily.
**Gstrati16**: Right.
**Eawente**: They just need to be comfortable.
**Lani.johnston1**: Yeah.
**Gstrati16**: Okay.
**Lani.johnston1**: Just have them bring their own chairs in a tent.
**Esherrill2018**: We've got three tents currently, so I'm bringing a cluster truck tent, a Colts tent, and then her family has a tent, so I think we'll be good there.
**Esherrill2018**: And then they all bring chairs.
**Ataylor**: Yep.
**Eawente**: Okay.
**Eawente**: Tito's will bring their own.
**Eawente**: Just beat the pro on a tent or just a table.
**Lani.johnston1**: I mean, if there's an.
**Lani.johnston1**: If there's an extra one.
**Lani.johnston1**: Great.
**Lani.johnston1**: But if not, don't, you know?
**Lani.johnston1**: No worries.
**Lani.johnston1**: I'd rather have our people.
**Lani.johnston1**: So the Hole in One witness and the launcher people have tents, and I.
**Eawente**: Think they're bringing their own.
**Eawente**: Right, Evan?
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Eawente**: Yeah.
**Eawente**: So I have a couple tents, and then our neighbor just offered tents and stuff too, so I can bring an extra one.
**Eawente**: Steve, we just bring whatever tables you have.
**Ataylor**: Just.
**Ataylor**: Yep.
**Aalarson03**: I've got a table and a tent.
**Aalarson03**: I can put them both in the bed of my truck.
**Eawente**: Perfect.
**Ataylor**: I'm not breaking my tent because I don't have to worry about it.
**Eawente**: All right, what else?
**Eawente**: Anybody else?
**Eawente**: Questions?
**Aalarson03**: I. I sent you a text earlier today.
**Aalarson03**: I.
**Aalarson03**: Some.
**Aalarson03**: One of the guys that.
**Aalarson03**: A buddy of mine that's playing in the event.
**Eawente**: Yeah, that's fine.
**Aalarson03**: His girlfriend is trying to see if she can get off work to meet him at the reception and wanted to know if she could pay at the door.
**Ataylor**: Yep.
**Ataylor**: Yes.
**Ataylor**: Perfect.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Eawente**: I'm messing with the seating chart still, so that should be fine.
**Eawente**: I think there's room.
**Eawente**: There's either room.
**Eawente**: Yeah.
**Eawente**: You guys can figure it out between you and Todd.
**Eawente**: You guys, can.
**Eawente**: You have two tables to spread out a little bit?
**Eawente**: That's okay.
**Eawente**: I don't know whose girlfriend it is, so I don't know who to put her with.
**Aalarson03**: Luke Parker.
**Eawente**: Oh.
**Eawente**: So Luke Parker's girlfriend probably wants to sit with Luke Parker and A.J.
**Lani.johnston1**: I mean, she probably prefer to sit with me and Steve, but whatever.
**Aalarson03**: We're.
**Aalarson03**: We're much more handsome.
**Gstrati16**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: That'S fine.
**Aalarson03**: He's not.
**Aalarson03**: He's not 100 that she's going to be able to get off work, so that's why she's not like.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Eawente**: Anyway, that's fine.
**Eawente**: There's only nine at Luke's table.
**Ataylor**: Perfect.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Eawente**: Thanks.
**Eawente**: Whoever just put Luke Parker's guest.
**Gstrati16**: Cool.
**Eawente**: What else?
**Eawente**: Any other questions?
**Eawente**: Concerns?
**Aalarson03**: Nope.
**Aalarson03**: It's gonna be a good day.
**Ataylor**: Cool.
**Esherrill2018**: We're excited.
**Gstrati16**: Mm.
**Aalarson03**: Does anybody look at the weather forecast yet?
**Esherrill2018**: Every day.
**Laurenwakefield**: Maybe don't look at it right now.
**Laurenwakefield**: Give it a couple days.
**Gstrati16**: Is it good?
**Aalarson03**: Is it bad?
**Aalarson03**: It's not good.
**Laurenwakefield**: Not great right now.
**Esherrill2018**: Not great.
**Eawente**: Oh, it went up to 50% in storms.
**Aalarson03**: That just means there's 50% chance that it won't.
**Eawente**: That's.
**Esherrill2018**: That's a fact.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Aalarson03**: And did you know?
**Aalarson03**: I.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Aalarson03**: When.
**Aalarson03**: What's the only job you can be wrong 100% of the job, 100% of the time.
**Aalarson03**: Keep your job.
**Aalarson03**: It's a weatherman.
**Aalarson03**: I learned this the other day that the 50% chance of rain just means that 50% of the viewing area is going to get rain.
**Aalarson03**: Not necessarily the 50% chance that it's is going to rain.
**Aalarson03**: I thought that was interesting.
**Eawente**: I didn't hurt you, Boys and girls.
**Eawente**: You can still play.
**Aalarson03**: Oh, yeah.
**Laurenwakefield**: It rained last year and it went great, right?
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Eawente**: Were you there?
**Laurenwakefield**: I mean, I know there was a crash.
**Eawente**: Everybody coming in at 4 o' clock and asking for booze and yelling at me because they didn't get to finish their rounds.
**Laurenwakefield**: I mean, but like, the.
**Laurenwakefield**: The overall, we have a B.
**Laurenwakefield**: There's a baby, right?
**Laurenwakefield**: Like, that's.
**Ataylor**: Good.
**Esherrill2018**: Little rain is good.
**Esherrill2018**: I'll throw on the lightweight golf hoodie that we're getting now.
**Esherrill2018**: Very nice.
**Eawente**: There you go.
**Eawente**: Everybody can wear those.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Lani.johnston1**: Lauren.
**Esherrill2018**: Thank you for doing photos, Daya.
**Eawente**: Oh, you're welcome.
**Laurenwakefield**: I'm Lauren, by the way.
**Laurenwakefield**: Sorry, I've these last two meetings and just like totally forgot to get on.
**Ataylor**: Same.
**Eawente**: Great to meet you guys.
**Eawente**: Nice to meet you too.
**Eawente**: Lauren's obviously.
**Eawente**: Yeah, go ahead.
**Laurenwakefield**: Charlie too, who's not.
**Laurenwakefield**: He's out of town, but he'll be there with me on Friday.
**Eawente**: So are you bringing more?
**Ataylor**: Fantastic.
**Ataylor**: Yep.
**Laurenwakefield**: Yeah, we're bringing Wesley to the dinner part.
**Laurenwakefield**: Not during the day.
**Laurenwakefield**: She would not be good for efficiency.
**Laurenwakefield**: Crazy.
**Gstrati16**: Perfect.
**Eawente**: Bonnie was our first birdies for babies couple.
**Eawente**: She's kind of like my right hand person.
**Eawente**: She lives across the street.
**Eawente**: She gets to, honey, I need help.
**Eawente**: I'm like, give it to me, give it to me.
**Eawente**: She says that, and then I send her like 20 texts there.
**Eawente**: I'm like, see?
**Eawente**: I gotta go to work.
**Esherrill2018**: Well, we appreciate you guys very much for working with us.
**Esherrill2018**: It'll be a good day.
**Ataylor**: It.
**Eawente**: It'll be an awesome day.
**Ataylor**: Yep.
**Eawente**: I don't have anything else.
**Gstrati16**: So if.
**Eawente**: Nobody has any questions, concerns that somebody asked a question in chat.
**Eawente**: Fireflies.
**Eawente**: Is that aj?
**Eawente**: It must be.
**Gstrati16**: I don't know.
**Esherrill2018**: It says it's his note taker.
**Esherrill2018**: At the very least.
**Aalarson03**: I think teams is.
**Aalarson03**: They're now.
**Aalarson03**: They're now putting in an automatic note taker in all these teams meetings.
**Aalarson03**: And then eventually you got to pay for the.
**Aalarson03**: Then you got to pay for the membership, I think.
**Eawente**: Huh.
**Laurenwakefield**: That was actually like, I missed last time and I felt like I had like all these questions and stuff.
**Laurenwakefield**: And I was like, oh, Nicole's gonna kill me.
**Laurenwakefield**: I read the whole thing.
**Eawente**: It was great.
**Aalarson03**: That's good.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Gstrati16**: All right.
**Eawente**: I'm good.
**Gstrati16**: Okay.
**Eawente**: Thanks, Nicole, for everything.
**Eawente**: Yes, thanks, Nicole.
**Esherrill2018**: Thank you very much.
**Lani.johnston1**: So.
**Lani.johnston1**: So no, no changes.
**Lani.johnston1**: Nicole, are you sure.
**Aalarson03**: You don't mess with Nicole.
**Aalarson03**: You just don't mess with Nicole.
**Aalarson03**: Like, she's.
**Eawente**: Just not.
**Lani.johnston1**: You would hate my job.
**Lani.johnston1**: You would absolutely hate my job.
**Eawente**: Because I would say.
**Gstrati16**: No.
**Ataylor**: I was wondering if the.
**Eawente**: I already told Logan.
**Eawente**: I said, I don't care what Todd says.
**Eawente**: There's a hard deadline next year of 10 days before the golf outing.
**Eawente**: No more.
**Eawente**: I'm not.
**Eawente**: I'm gonna put an automated answer.
**Eawente**: We're done talking until the outing.
**Ataylor**: Is it.
**Esherrill2018**: Is it normally, like, changes up until this point, or are we the unique.
**Lani.johnston1**: No, it changes up until the shotgun starts.
**Gstrati16**: Yeah.
**Esherrill2018**: That'S what I figured.
**Aalarson03**: So.
**Lani.johnston1**: Yeah, so I guess.
**Eawente**: And then when Aaron gets mad at me because I didn't turn in the proper amount of people, and then there's not enough food, and it's just a whole thing.
**Eawente**: Guys.
**Lani.johnston1**: When we're volunteering our time, we can do whatever we want.
**Lani.johnston1**: But when I get paid for it, I have to kind of do whatever they want.
**Eawente**: All right.
**Eawente**: We're good?
**Eawente**: Yeah.
**Eawente**: I'm going to go work.
**Lani.johnston1**: See you guys on Friday.
**Eawente**: See you Friday.
**Eawente**: You then.
**Lani.johnston1**: All right.
**Eawente**: Thanks, guys.
