## Transcript
**Crusin**: Sa.
**Jdawson**: All right, Nick, take it away.
**Jdawson**: You're muted.
**Jdawson**: You're not on another meeting.
**Jdawson**: Here, let me get candy.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Hello?
**Jdawson**: Candid's on here.
**Jdawson**: Are you on here, Jesse?
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Crusin**: So we have.
**Crusin**: We have the site demo, which is.
**Jdawson**: An actual number from bcs.
**Jdawson**: And then they had a mobile mobilization number.
**Jdawson**: Concrete Camden was.
**Jdawson**: Was working on.
**Jdawson**: On this if you want to go over that.
**Jdawson**: Candid.
**Crusin**: All right, so we're talking storm capture slash fault.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Crusin**: Okay.
**Crusin**: Yeah.
**Crusin**: So basically this is just a plug.
**Jdawson**: So when you took the cubic square feet of storage and multiplied it by the 16 or $20 a foot, like, what are we looking at with that?
**Jdawson**: 200.
**Crusin**: Yeah, so I took the.
**Jdawson**: Maybe you can share your estimate.
**Crusin**: Can you see that or no?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I can see it.
**Crusin**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Are we sure there's not more square footage than that?
**Jdawson**: Doesn't seem like a whole lot, but.
**Crusin**: No.
**Crusin**: So what I did was took number here, right here.
**Crusin**: I'm basically got the square footage off of this.
**Jdawson**: So you took the PDF tool that allows you to do an area.
**Crusin**: Well, I put in chat gbt.
**Crusin**: Then I also use these numbers down here.
**Jdawson**: Oh, but if you go.
**Jdawson**: Go on the right hand side, there's not a scale set.
**Jdawson**: Do you know how to set a scale on a PDF?
**Crusin**: Yes.
**Crusin**: Nick, Is that what you just showed me?
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Crusin**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: Well, there's a little button on the right lower side that says scale, not set.
**Jdawson**: Just click on that, right?
**Jdawson**: And then say calibrate.
**Jdawson**: Pick that one.
**Jdawson**: Custom calibrate.
**Jdawson**: Say.
**Jdawson**: Okay, go to that grading the scale below you.
**Jdawson**: Or you can.
**Jdawson**: You can either click on those or the.
**Jdawson**: You can use that grading scale.
**Crusin**: Just click this.
**Jdawson**: So click on the 0, click on the 30 or 60, whatever, and then change that one that's highlighted.
**Jdawson**: Don't.
**Jdawson**: Don't mess the whole thing up.
**Jdawson**: All you gotta do is click in it and get on the one.
**Jdawson**: It's one foot and change that to 60 and then hit Apply scale.
**Jdawson**: Now go to the right in the middle, right above the two little arrows.
**Jdawson**: Go to the right side the tools.
**Jdawson**: Right above that is a box.
**Jdawson**: Click on that.
**Jdawson**: And then you just click on the perimeter of that.
**Jdawson**: That shape.
**Jdawson**: Go to the outside of it.
**Jdawson**: You need to go to the outside of it.
**Jdawson**: That's fine.
**Crusin**: Well, so this was a word terminal.
**Jdawson**: That'll be fine.
**Jdawson**: But I would have gone to the.
**Jdawson**: A little dash line around it.
**Jdawson**: It indicates concrete, but.
**Crusin**: Oh.
**Jdawson**: So just hit the hand button right below where you are and then start over.
**Jdawson**: Is that scale correct?
**Jdawson**: Because it says 1 inch equals 30ft.
**Jdawson**: And then the scale we have is 1.2 inch equals 60ft.
**Jdawson**: It calculates it all.
**Jdawson**: You're still on the inside.
**Crusin**: SA.
**Jdawson**: Then click that.
**Jdawson**: Double click it there.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: Go up.
**Jdawson**: So there's 13,000.
**Jdawson**: You pay her.
**Jdawson**: Thank you.
**Jdawson**: Send me the invoice, if you would.
**Jdawson**: Make sure it gets sent to me.
**Crusin**: There you go.
**Jdawson**: So you look at average slab costs in Florida.
**Jdawson**: It's four to six dollars a square foot.
**Jdawson**: So if you go $6,006 square foot, your slab's going to be about 100 grand.
**Jdawson**: What'd you have in there?
**Jdawson**: It was a hundred.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: What else is on there?
**Jdawson**: The estimate.
**Crusin**: Foreign storm capture pad.
**Crusin**: So that's just that small.
**Jdawson**: So we have 13,000 square feet.
**Jdawson**: So how many cubic feet of storage is total between the parking lot and that one cistern under the building?
**Jdawson**: What did the drawings call for?
**Crusin**: So which one do you want?
**Crusin**: This one here?
**Jdawson**: No, See where the little pipe connects the parking lot system to the.
**Jdawson**: That walled section right there.
**Jdawson**: So what does that say in there?
**Jdawson**: It's cubic storage is.
**Jdawson**: What does the note say?
**Crusin**: This one doesn't have.
**Jdawson**: Where in the notes does it tell you how much storage it needs?
**Jdawson**: Is that in the bottom page or in the page with the.
**Crusin**: Actually, I was not able to find that.
**Jdawson**: Go back to the storm calculations.
**Jdawson**: It's the page with the storm trap, or whatever that shit's called, or tank quantities.
**Crusin**: This is the only thing.
**Jdawson**: Zoom in.
**Jdawson**: Total system storage.
**Jdawson**: 20,000, 438 cubic feet.
**Crusin**: And did you know this is going to be 12ft deep?
**Jdawson**: No, it's not, because they don't have the volume for that.
**Jdawson**: Now, panels.
**Jdawson**: I don't know what these panels are, but panels.
**Crusin**: It says 12 panels high.
**Crusin**: And then the panel here is two feet.
**Crusin**: That's why I'm a little iffy on what they're calling out in the parking lot.
**Jdawson**: Well, it's not that deep.
**Jdawson**: Tell you.
**Jdawson**: They're supposed to stay above the water table, which they say is 3 foot 6 below surface.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Crusin**: I don't think we actually know what is required.
**Jdawson**: So zoom in on that chart again.
**Jdawson**: Well, that's 12 tank stack rtank modules.
**Jdawson**: So those are the modules in the.
**Jdawson**: Those are the outfall structures that are deeper.
**Jdawson**: And it's not the Overall system storage volume.
**Jdawson**: 20,438 cubic feet.
**Jdawson**: So we would need to make these things.
**Jdawson**: If we had them stacked.
**Jdawson**: If we had them two foot.
**Jdawson**: And then go back to that.
**Jdawson**: Open this up.
**Crusin**: SA.
**Jdawson**: So our bottom elevation is 50.87.
**Jdawson**: The spillway is at 53.
**Jdawson**: So that's 2.13ft times the size of that pond.
**Crusin**: SA.
**Jdawson**: So what's the size of that pond times 7830 times 2.13.
**Jdawson**: That's 16,677.
**Jdawson**: We'll just say 17,000.
**Jdawson**: So we're safe.
**Jdawson**: So we got 17,000 plus the 20,000, whatever that is.
**Jdawson**: How many total cubic feet is that?
**Jdawson**: 37,000.
**Jdawson**: 37,000.
**Jdawson**: So take 37,000 times 20, which is the cost per cubic feet to seal it.
**Jdawson**: And that's our storm capture 750,000.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: That's a concrete number.
**Jdawson**: Well, the concrete is the concrete storm capture storm system.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So 7:50.
**Jdawson**: Unless.
**Jdawson**: Did you put that down in site improvements, utilities?
**Jdawson**: No, that's what we have right there.
**Jdawson**: The storm capture slash vault number.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so then that's that number.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so then in Here, storm system 107.
**Jdawson**: And then the install of that storm capture.
**Jdawson**: What was his install price for the.
**Jdawson**: The other system?
**Crusin**: 7.
**Crusin**: Something crazy.
**Jdawson**: He combined his supply and install price.
**Jdawson**: He didn't separate them.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so let's just say that he's got a hundred thousand dollars to set him.
**Jdawson**: It's at the crane.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: In labor, which is high.
**Jdawson**: So just make another line there and put installation of old castle system.
**Jdawson**: And you can follow up with Bruno and just tell them that that's what we're getting or like we're figuring it's that much.
**Jdawson**: I remember asking him and he did.
**Jdawson**: He would.
**Jdawson**: He didn't have it figured yet.
**Jdawson**: His install cost.
**Jdawson**: They would set him.
**Jdawson**: In two days, you'll have a crane.
**Jdawson**: You spent 25 grand on a crane.
**Jdawson**: And guys to put, you know, set them in there.
**Jdawson**: All the ceiling is done by old castle spoke.
**Jdawson**: So that should be.
**Jdawson**: That's more than enough, really.
**Jdawson**: It's probably around 50 to set them all, but you put 75 in there.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so now the deep foundations we don't need because now we got a building that we can put on shallow, shallow foundations.
**Jdawson**: So that goes away.
**Jdawson**: And what was that plug based off of?
**Jdawson**: It was just a guess.
**Jdawson**: So when you look at deep foundations, if it's a driven pile, you can look that up there.
**Jdawson**: You can figure four piles per pile cap.
**Jdawson**: You know, it's about $40 a linear foot.
**Jdawson**: And say those things have to be 60ft deep, so they're about $2,400 a pile.
**Jdawson**: And then you just take a, you know, run column lines.
**Jdawson**: Every 20ft or whatever is an estimate.
**Jdawson**: And then have a foundation there.
**Jdawson**: And then you'll have just multiply that and then run a column down the center of the building probably or I think 50 foot is the max on a warehouse.
**Jdawson**: I would do 50 foot based on that footprint for having columns.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And the cmu, that was just Mark calling Camden.
**Jdawson**: He didn't give us anything written and I guess call him back and say Mark, you can at least break out the concrete from the masonry.
**Jdawson**: So you got those two numbers there.
**Jdawson**: Because regardless, if we end up putting a pre engineered metal building on it, he would have the concrete slab and the foundations, just not the cmu.
**Crusin**: Right.
**Jdawson**: So you need to have them give you those numbers and break it out.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Crusin**: I'll give a hold of them.
**Jdawson**: And then you know the.
**Jdawson**: So up in the concrete just add a line.
**Jdawson**: So you know the concrete is foundations and well now it's not in masonry.
**Jdawson**: You put it in concrete foundations and then concrete slab on grade 8 inches.
**Jdawson**: So you can look at an 8 inch slab.
**Jdawson**: You know, if he's got his number grade, if not, that's probably 10 to $12 a square foot.
**Jdawson**: And then your foundations, you can figure they're going to be about six to seven hundred dollars a piece for the footings and then your, your great beam that goes around the rest of the perimeter tying them together.
**Jdawson**: You probably, I don't know, 40, $50 a linear foot for that.
**Jdawson**: And then you can, unless he's got the number, he figured all that, he can just give you those numbers.
**Jdawson**: But that'll be needed regardless of whatever we do for the building type.
**Jdawson**: So then metals like that, you need to be specific.
**Jdawson**: This is steel for you know, a steel structure versus there should be a, you know, then on our other estimate will be pre engineered metal building costs which will have metal panels on the outside and the structure and the roof.
**Jdawson**: Or else if you go with a TPO roof over top of the metal building versus you know, metal panels, you have those two options here.
**Jdawson**: You're breaking out.
**Jdawson**: All this stuff is easy to get online.
**Jdawson**: You just look for average square foot costs for TPO roof, you know, insulation tapered.
**Jdawson**: And then this metal is based on a number that we got online of average cost for a metal building structure.
**Jdawson**: And that includes the columns and the, the trusses.
**Jdawson**: For a flat roof, okay, that's just columns and trusses.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So you just need to be specific when you describe it there.
**Jdawson**: It makes it easy for me.
**Jdawson**: Metal warehouse building, that could mean.
**Jdawson**: Is it the whole thing, whatever this is steel structure, columns, truss and decking.
**Crusin**: Would you say backing?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, the columns, the Trust that steel number could vary by a lot.
**Jdawson**: Jesse.
**Jdawson**: I asked J2J to give a number and he was saying just depending on like the spacing of the trusses and how many columns he needs it, it can vary by a lot.
**Jdawson**: And he, he wasn't able to really give a.
**Jdawson**: A number.
**Jdawson**: Two million is fine.
**Jdawson**: That would be plenty.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that's at 60 a square foot of 2,100,000.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Crusin**: So this, this is just another plug.
**Crusin**: So added framing material first.
**Crusin**: Waiting.
**Crusin**: What's that?
**Jdawson**: That's fine.
**Jdawson**: They'll usually just mount those right to the block wall.
**Jdawson**: So it'll just be a little extra money.
**Jdawson**: So the CMU insulation, you got that block fill, Is that what that is?
**Crusin**: Yep.
**Crusin**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: TPO roofing.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Overhead door.
**Jdawson**: You got all that pricing.
**Jdawson**: What is the hundred thousand dollars for?
**Crusin**: So I took the pricing from what we got for Avon Radial and It was about 25,000 per door for those doors there.
**Jdawson**: So we only have one loading dock door.
**Jdawson**: So you need to have 25,000 there.
**Jdawson**: This is an actual truck dock.
**Jdawson**: The rest are just roll up doors.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So it's only.
**Jdawson**: You see where they got it sloped down and they got an actual.
**Jdawson**: They'll have the dock lock and everything at that ramp.
**Jdawson**: That's the only loading dock door.
**Jdawson**: The others are just overhead oversized garage doors.
**Jdawson**: So if you figure, you know the, the garage door only price from the other radials.
**Jdawson**: Like okay, that would be those two, those other three doors we're putting in.
**Crusin**: So one at 25 and then the rest, that's regular door price.
**Jdawson**: Just.
**Jdawson**: Or you just put the loading.
**Jdawson**: Just a loading dock overhead door.
**Jdawson**: That's all that goes on those others.
**Crusin**: Yep.
**Crusin**: All metal doors.
**Crusin**: Well, we were talking about that.
**Crusin**: Think we counted for one here.
**Crusin**: This one here and then here.
**Crusin**: I know me and Nick were talking yesterday.
**Crusin**: A double door.
**Crusin**: What do you think, Jesse?
**Crusin**: Double door, single door on this wall.
**Jdawson**: Put a double door there so they can get a pallet through it.
**Crusin**: So that's ten grand there.
**Jdawson**: Turn fixing this as we're talking.
**Crusin**: You want me to go ahead and do the doors?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, fix your openings.
**Jdawson**: I want to see what our number is per square foot.
**Jdawson**: It's 25.
**Jdawson**: Okay, I see what you're doing.
**Jdawson**: You're doing.
**Jdawson**: So the other roll of doors, if they're 5,000 a piece.
**Jdawson**: You got 5,000 in there now.
**Jdawson**: So it's 15 because there's three of them.
**Jdawson**: No, you already got it in the line above it.
**Crusin**: Well, that's.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Crusin**: These are all plugs.
**Crusin**: We spoke to Mike.
**Crusin**: This Morning we gave him a little more information, so hopefully they'll get us some better numbers on these.
**Jdawson**: But.
**Jdawson**: So that's frame, insulate and hang that 30 foot tall wall.
**Crusin**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: It's 25,000.
**Crusin**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: He said that or you just.
**Jdawson**: Oh, he's working on a number.
**Jdawson**: He asked for more information this morning, which we gave him.
**Jdawson**: But what was your plug based off of a linear foot cost for a typical wall that high in Florida?
**Crusin**: It might actually be more.
**Jdawson**: We were measuring that wall and it was like over 100ft.
**Jdawson**: So it might actually be more than that.
**Jdawson**: Did you.
**Jdawson**: Do you go online?
**Jdawson**: ChatGPT?
**Jdawson**: Say, what is the average cost for a 30 foot tall wall?
**Jdawson**: 33 foot.
**Jdawson**: So it'll go up into the bar joist.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, let me type that in right now.
**Jdawson**: Like polished concrete.
**Jdawson**: Same thing.
**Jdawson**: How much does square foot cost?
**Jdawson**: You guys could have been doing all this stuff.
**Jdawson**: Tandon, like use chat GPT.
**Jdawson**: You can figure a lot of shit out or give you a range, high to low, and you pick somewhere in the middle if you're trying to be aggressive or you pick it high if it looks like it's going to be there.
**Jdawson**: Stucco looks way low.
**Jdawson**: It's a lot of stucco.
**Jdawson**: Maybe not.
**Jdawson**: I don't know.
**Jdawson**: It just seems a little low.
**Jdawson**: We got to go back to storm capture, too, because now we gotta put at the.
**Jdawson**: The open bottom ones.
**Jdawson**: Did he say were.
**Jdawson**: How much were those installed?
**Jdawson**: 16 a foot.
**Crusin**: I don't recall him giving us the.
**Speaker 2**: What?
**Crusin**: I don't recall him giving us a price on the.
**Crusin**: Oh.
**Jdawson**: He did the unseal the ones.
**Jdawson**: He gave us two numbers for what they would be.
**Crusin**: That was 12 to 20 for the parking lot storage, but you're thinking he said 16.
**Jdawson**: So you have 5,616 square feet of the lower rate for those two flood overflow areas under the building.
**Jdawson**: I already calculated up just times.
**Jdawson**: The times is lower.
**Jdawson**: What was his lower number?
**Jdawson**: They tell you what it is on this drawing so you don't have to take anything off.
**Crusin**: What do you want me to do?
**Jdawson**: I want you to take 5,616 cubic feet times the lower number he gave us for the storm capture.
**Jdawson**: Nick, just type it in there.
**Jdawson**: 5,616 cubic feet of flood storage.
**Jdawson**: Nick, you going to write it in there?
**Jdawson**: Oh, on the Excel sheet, yeah.
**Jdawson**: This is flood storage.
**Crusin**: Anyone times that by 16?
**Jdawson**: Was that the low number he gave us?
**Crusin**: Obviously between 12 and 20.
**Crusin**: So it's like.
**Jdawson**: So that's a $12 one.
**Jdawson**: Because it's simple.
**Jdawson**: They just set Them in there and we're done.
**Jdawson**: So it's 67, so just round it up to 70.
**Jdawson**: Okay, go back down.
**Jdawson**: Where were we?
**Jdawson**: So just going to make sure you got all good numbers for those.
**Jdawson**: Keep going down, keep going down.
**Jdawson**: Do you base that off a square foot number for warehouse fire, sprinkler and clear water?
**Jdawson**: Well, it's a plug, but plugged off of what?
**Crusin**: Plugged that one in.
**Crusin**: I'll, we'll double check it with clear water.
**Jdawson**: So guys get together and then we'll review this again.
**Jdawson**: Like what's the summary price total currently right now?
**Jdawson**: Go to the summary page.
**Jdawson**: It's 9 million.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so just go through there, plug all these, you know, get numbers.
**Jdawson**: They just do the chat GPT.
**Jdawson**: Find out what the average costs are for these by the square foot and size of everything.
**Jdawson**: And then do the same thing with the sheet you did for the pre engineered metal building.
**Jdawson**: And then, then you use the original numbers from, you know, we'll get into, you know, put elevated concrete slab of 12 inch thick for the, if we have to, you know, use the original storm number from, from Bruno.
**Jdawson**: But that means that we need to add in all that block work under the building.
**Jdawson**: We need to change our structure.
**Jdawson**: And I can help you add that in, but you can search for it.
**Jdawson**: You know, you got to add in all the deep foundations and the piles, the pile caps, you know, they'll need piles all the way around the perimeter footing as well, you know, to support it so it stays the same as the building and you know, the structure.
**Jdawson**: And just based it off of that.
**Jdawson**: Base it off of 60 foot piles, based it off of, you know, $40 a linear foot for the pile, you know, four per capita for columns.
**Jdawson**: Space your columns 50ft.
**Jdawson**: Does that all make sense?
**Crusin**: Kinda, yeah.
**Crusin**: We'll start working on it, work through what we got here first, get these numbers straightened out and then we'll switch.
**Jdawson**: To the other type and it'll be like that elevated slab will be a double mat at a minimum.
**Jdawson**: Double mat reinforced concrete slab at 12 inches to, to carry all this weight over that section of building that all this storm is under.
**Jdawson**: The only slab on grade would be that area on the top left that doesn't have anything under it.
**Crusin**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And then I would take your design costs out of there if he's gonna.
**Jdawson**: Or we can have that as an alternate for the design.
**Jdawson**: He's already had the civil engineering done, he's got the landscape engineering done.
**Crusin**: Get rid of these.
**Jdawson**: Well, I mean we can put that as a, as an Alternate.
**Jdawson**: But he's already got some of the stuff done, right?
**Crusin**: Yeah, we took some money out.
**Jdawson**: Well, I mean, did Kimmich give us a price for this?
**Jdawson**: I can't remember.
**Jdawson**: We have structural engineering.
**Jdawson**: Chris got us a number and sent this to him as well.
**Jdawson**: Where's your dewatering system?
**Jdawson**: Plugged in here.
**Crusin**: 100,000 is somewhere in here.
**Crusin**: Right here.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: All right, we'll just run through, get those numbers, get all the different ones updated for the different proposals were given.
**Crusin**: Mike just called me back, so I'm sure he's got some numbers here or some questions though.
**Jdawson**: Okay, but we're gonna have.
**Jdawson**: So we're gonna have one that has the original storm system in it, that's a masonry building.
**Jdawson**: And then we'll have one that's a masonry building that has the Old Castle system and regular slab on grade versus existing system with all the deep foundations and additional work.
**Jdawson**: And then we'll have the pre engineered metal building with both scenarios of existing storm capture system versus Old Castle.
**Jdawson**: So a lot of these things will all be the same.
**Jdawson**: You know, you're just changing the structure and the, the storm are the, are the two things that are going to change.
**Jdawson**: So the goal is we're going to show them we can build it cheaper by going to Old Castle and we got a better system that's not going to get crushed when the fire department shows up.
**Jdawson**: We don't even know if this thing would get approved to be under that parking lot as shallow as it is.
**Jdawson**: And the weights.
**Crusin**: Right.
**Jdawson**: So I looked through there.
**Jdawson**: I think they give a max weight that can even go on this later.
**Jdawson**: And I think the fire truck's more than that.
**Jdawson**: They're like £60,000 or something.
**Jdawson**: I think that I saw there were three different designs for the R tank as far as weight that it can handle.
**Jdawson**: And like, have you looked up what is the local code?
**Jdawson**: You can chatgpt that as well and see like what is, you know, what is the allowable or the required.
**Jdawson**: That's At Marina bay we use HS20, which I think is what Bruno quoted.
**Jdawson**: That's what's shown on the drawings.
**Jdawson**: But yeah, well, we'll, we'll check.
**Crusin**: I think I saw HS22.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, just check all that.
**Jdawson**: You know, they shot HS20 traffic load 10 ton max.
**Jdawson**: Like £60,000 is.
**Jdawson**: That's 30 ton.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: There were two our tank options that had higher load ratings than this HS20.
**Jdawson**: But, but Bruno bid HS20.
**Jdawson**: Is that what they expect?
**Jdawson**: I would think so, because I think he bid what's on the drawings, which is HS20.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that's what the drawing.
**Jdawson**: Then we don't have to figure out what it should be.
**Jdawson**: We can say per what the drawings are.
**Crusin**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: A 60,000 pound fire truck, fully loaded, is going to sink through your pavement.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So just get all that info together and then we'll meet again later today once you get that lined up.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: All right, see you.
**Speaker 2**: Hello.
**Crusin**: Hey, sorry, Mr.
**Crusin**: Call Meeting.
**Speaker 2**: All right, Sorry.
**Speaker 2**: I got a little question for you.
**Speaker 2**: So the new existing building is going to be attached to the.
**Crusin**: Sorry.
**Speaker 2**: The new building is going to be attached to the existing building, Right?
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 2**: This building is going to have metal joists, right?
**Crusin**: Yes.
**Speaker 2**: It'S going to have metal joists.
**Speaker 2**: So you're going to have columns in the middle and you can have your, your 30 something or your 40 something metal joists on the top.
**Speaker 2**: So you're going to have columns on the middle of the building.
**Crusin**: Yep.
**Speaker 2**: Let me see.
**Speaker 2**: What else, what else, what else?
**Speaker 2**: So your roof deck is going to be most likely corrugated metal.
**Crusin**: Yes, it should be.
**Crusin**: Yep.
**Crusin**: And TPO on top of that.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, yeah.
**Speaker 2**: Most likely to be all.
**Speaker 2**: Let me see.
**Speaker 2**: So you sent me this.
**Speaker 2**: Measurements 59, 3 and everything is 130ft tall.
**Crusin**: Yes.
**Speaker 2**: Okay.
**Speaker 2**: So now the side that's going to be attached to the new building is going to go higher than the existing building, right?
**Speaker 2**: The existing building for what I saw, it doesn't look like 30 foot tall.
**Crusin**: Yeah, I couldn't answer that.
**Crusin**: I don't know the height of the existing building.
**Crusin**: It might be going above it.
**Speaker 2**: If I give a price for the exterior walls that we have right now for stucco and I don't include the other two sections that we have there because there is One section, there's 100.
**Crusin**: And.
**Speaker 2**: 138Ft and then you have another one that is 154ft.
**Speaker 2**: Let's say that the existing building has 16ft tall.
**Speaker 2**: Then I will have to add the height that's left over for the new building to be able to do stucco, you understand?
**Speaker 2**: Because that's a lot of linear footage.
**Speaker 2**: I'm sorry, That's a lot of square footage to add, you know, to miss for stucco estimate.
**Crusin**: Yeah.
**Crusin**: You're saying up on the roof of this, the other building.
**Speaker 2**: That is correct.
**Speaker 2**: I'm saying from the roof of the existing building to the very top of the new building.
**Crusin**: Right.
**Speaker 2**: You probably have another.
**Speaker 2**: I'll say 15ft.
**Crusin**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: You understand?
**Crusin**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: And that can come and bite us on the ass.
**Speaker 2**: And that's a lot of Materials and scaffolding and stuff.
**Crusin**: Yeah, I hear you.
**Speaker 2**: And nobody bothered to go over there to that new building and measure the height or.
**Speaker 2**: Or try to take a look at it or anything like that for this.
**Speaker 2**: For this estimate?
**Crusin**: Nope.
**Speaker 2**: I'm gonna kick your ass.
**Speaker 2**: You always can't.
**Speaker 2**: Every time your attention.
**Speaker 2**: Something, hand them another building, you gotta go look at the existing building.
**Crusin**: Yeah, I mean, I would think, but I was never given the chance to.
**Speaker 2**: So you tell Nick, hey, we need to go over there and take a look at it.
**Speaker 2**: You always got to take a look at it, because if it's smaller, the things can change.
**Speaker 2**: And you have a lot of stuff.
**Speaker 2**: If we got to do stockhold, we got to put the scaffolding on top of that.
**Speaker 2**: On top of that building's roof.
**Speaker 2**: You understand?
**Speaker 2**: And we don't know how, you know, how stable is that roof?
**Speaker 2**: How old is that roof?
**Speaker 2**: If it's made out of metal, if it's made out of wood, you don't know if you're gonna need.
**Speaker 2**: How do you call this crap?
**Speaker 2**: Son of a.
**Speaker 2**: Instead of scaffolding, you're gonna have to do it out of.
**Crusin**: Yeah, no, I hear you.
**Speaker 2**: A floating scaffold.
**Speaker 2**: There you go.
**Speaker 2**: The one you come down from the roof and you bring down enough.
**Speaker 2**: You understand what I'm saying?
**Crusin**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: So you don't know if you're gonna have to do it away or not.
**Speaker 2**: So there's a lot of variables when you do something like this that you need to look at.
**Crusin**: Sounds like you need to take a drive.
**Speaker 2**: I told.
**Speaker 2**: I want to kill Nick.
**Speaker 2**: I told Nick the other day, can I go take a look at the job site?
**Jdawson**: Sure.
**Speaker 2**: And he said, oh, the building is not there, but, you know, I can send you the drawing so you can look at it.
**Speaker 2**: And those are things that you need to look at, especially you, that you're going to be running the job.
**Speaker 2**: It's something that you and I need to be out of eyed at all times.
**Crusin**: I hear you.
**Speaker 2**: Because when I mess up and you correct me, and when you mess up, I'm there to back you up.
**Crusin**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: And we help each other out that way without losing any money.
**Speaker 2**: Because we don't need to be losing money.
**Speaker 2**: We need to make money.
**Crusin**: Yep, I hear you.
**Crusin**: So I don't have an answer for you on that.
**Crusin**: So I would need to give.
**Speaker 2**: And we need to give a price today.
**Crusin**: Yeah.
**Crusin**: So I don't know.
**Crusin**: I mean, I would say just.
**Speaker 2**: All right, what I'm gonna do is put some flu.
**Speaker 2**: I'm gonna add A floating scaffold.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 2**: If we, if we don't need it, you guys can give it back to the, to the owner and contingencies or productive change orders.
**Crusin**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: And I'm gonna do, I'm gonna do.
**Speaker 2**: I'm gonna get.
**Speaker 2**: I'm gonna put.
**Speaker 2**: I'm gonna add another 5% on top just in case the studs I called FBM and FBM doesn't have any 30 foot the max they carry.
**Speaker 2**: I think it's 16 foot studs and those go for like 20 $30 of piece.
**Crusin**: So for.
**Speaker 2**: Yep.
**Speaker 2**: They're expensive as.
**Speaker 2**: So for 122 foot wall.
**Crusin**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: It's gonna have to be a double wall.
**Speaker 2**: Like I mean one wall in the bottom.
**Speaker 2**: One wall in the top.
**Crusin**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: Now my question is this.
**Speaker 2**: We're gonna do all this without consulting an engineer or are we gonna have an engineer drawing later on in the future or.
**Crusin**: Probably not for the wall.
**Crusin**: I wouldn't think.
**Speaker 2**: Probably not for the wall.
**Crusin**: No.
**Speaker 2**: Okay, so we're gonna build the wall or wing.
**Crusin**: Yep.
**Speaker 2**: So we're gonna build it the way we want to in order to hold that.
**Speaker 2**: That son of a gun.
**Crusin**: Door.
**Crusin**: Roll up door.
**Speaker 2**: The roll up door.
**Speaker 2**: Now do you have any specs for the roll of door?
**Speaker 2**: Does it have to be an extreme heavy door?
**Crusin**: No.
**Speaker 2**: Can it be similar like a garage door lightweight.
**Crusin**: To a garage door?
**Crusin**: Just something that they can roll and drive forklifts in and out.
**Speaker 2**: Okay.
**Speaker 2**: All right.
**Speaker 2**: So we might be able to get with.
**Speaker 2**: We might be able to get away with some I beams.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, some I beams.
**Speaker 2**: And.
**Speaker 2**: And then in the inside we pat it out with some two by.
**Speaker 2**: With, with.
**Speaker 2**: With two bys.
**Speaker 2**: To be able to screw.
**Speaker 2**: To be able to screw into it and hold up the door in there.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Speaker 2**: Those I beams.
**Speaker 2**: I don't know the price of that.
**Speaker 2**: So we're gonna have to add at least just in contentious.
**Speaker 2**: We're gonna have to add at least three grand per.
**Speaker 2**: Per beam.
**Crusin**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: To be able to put it there, anchor it down and then have the.
**Speaker 2**: And then have bring a welder so they can weld it to the top or so we can manage.
**Speaker 2**: And we also need a header on top.
**Crusin**: Yes, exactly.
**Crusin**: Yep.
**Crusin**: Lvl.
**Crusin**: Well, if you're going metal already you might as well just.
**Speaker 2**: So no, LVL is not going to be a good, a good fit for that because you want it to last years and years and years.
**Speaker 2**: So that's going to have to be metal fabricated frame and then so they can attach the door.
**Crusin**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: All right, let's do.
**Speaker 2**: Let's do a rough estimate, and then we go from there.
**Speaker 2**: But you'll need to add a decent amount of money for contingencies in case we need it later on in the future.
**Jdawson**: Please.
**Speaker 2**: Yes, make sure, because this is a rough estimate.
**Speaker 2**: Okay.
**Crusin**: Yeah.
**Crusin**: We shouldn't even be freaking throwing numbers at this without more information.
**Jdawson**: Exactly.
**Speaker 2**: All right, buddy, let's start working on.
**Crusin**: All right, bye.
**Jdawson**: Thank you.
