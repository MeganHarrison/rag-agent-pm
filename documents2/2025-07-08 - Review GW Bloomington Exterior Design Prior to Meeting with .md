## Transcript
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: I know we're not, we're not going to go for the transom windows.
**Brian.schubert**: That's why we have this meeting.
**Brian.schubert**: We're going to take a look like how much distance is it from the top of those window openings?
**Brian.schubert**: From the top to the bottom of the deck.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: From the measurement I just pulled was from the top of the infill to the bottom of the, of those of the rafters.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: The bottom of the joists up high it was eight feet.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: And then from.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Yeah, it was eight feet there.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: And then from the finished floor to the top of the infill block was 9 foot 11.
**Brian.schubert**: If we got 8 foot.
**Brian.schubert**: Yeah.
**Brian.schubert**: We should be able to a lot of glass.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Or would they even be okay with.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: No, because there's a beam right there behind it.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: I was thinking where, where the ethis is that used to hold up the awnings.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Putting a transom window right there.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: But behind it is a beam.
**Brian.schubert**: Yeah, but like the city, like it's their own fault.
**Brian.schubert**: They want the windows to be see through.
**Brian.schubert**: Yeah, it's going to see a beam behind it.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: So yeah, if that's fine, then yeah, we could.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Where the, where that ethis is, where the, where the awnings were.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Take that ethos out and put a window right there.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Transom window.
**Brian.schubert**: Is Andrew joined yet?
**Amulder**: Not yet.
**Amulder**: I'll text him.
**Brian.schubert**: Okay.
**Brian.schubert**: I'm driving so I can't really look at anything close.
**Brian.schubert**: I'm 16 minutes away, Jack.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Right on.
**Amulder**: Okay, there's Andrew.
**Jdawson**: One minor thing, but on that east elevation, that window all the way to.
**Brian.schubert**: The right, there should be three there.
**Brian.schubert**: One of those just fell out.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Moving it around.
**Amulder**: Okay.
**Amulder**: And Andrew was thinking of adding transom windows instead of having them at the bottom.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I mean the only problem would be meeting that same square footage.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Because if we've got, if we can't do anything on the, on the south elevation in particular.
**Brian.schubert**: Right.
**Jdawson**: If we can't touch any on the area on the left because that CMU wall all the way up, I thought now I see then if we can only get 3 foot high, which I thought was what we had, those windows there are roughly six foot high.
**Jdawson**: So obviously we'd have to have that same height and twice the width.
**Brian.schubert**: Well, there's where.
**Brian.schubert**: So talking to Jack, he's saying there's eight foot between the top of the exist.
**Brian.schubert**: The window opens, we infill and you said the bottom of the bar joist or bottom of the deck?
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Bottom of the bar joist, bottom of the bar.
**Brian.schubert**: So there's eight foot there and you know, I don't think it's out of the question.
**Brian.schubert**: We are running in that same area on the south side.
**Brian.schubert**: Andrew, I don't know what you think, but we could almost put a giant window the size of your sign and just put the sign.
**Brian.schubert**: Put your sign on front of the window or something.
**Brian.schubert**: I don't know.
**Jcurtin**: A marketing guy won't like that.
**Jcurtin**: But yeah, I mean, if there's a way to do those transoms.
**Jcurtin**: If it's eight foot.
**Jdawson**: Starting the.
**Brian.schubert**: How many square foot are you able to.
**Brian.schubert**: If you've measured all those openings, how many total square foot of glass do we got to replace.
**Jdawson**: If we go one to one?
**Jdawson**: I mean, the windows there, then on the south elevation are six foot high.
**Brian.schubert**: Okay.
**Brian.schubert**: Do we lose Jack again?
**Jcurtin**: Well, I'll say if that's our first.
**Jcurtin**: Our first choice is to have those transoms instead of having to take out the block we already put in to put more windows back in.
**Jcurtin**: That would be our first choice if it works.
**Jcurtin**: I mean, because on the.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, now there's EFIs above those windows.
**Jcurtin**: So even if we just started it, if that's 8 foot, whatever that's at, Started there and then went up whatever square footage we can fit on that glass, I think that would be good.
**Brian.schubert**: For us, I guess, you know, part of the issue is, like, they don't want the glass down low.
**Brian.schubert**: It's basically a warehouse area.
**Brian.schubert**: Losing that square footage to put those walls in.
**Brian.schubert**: No one's gonna like that.
**Brian.schubert**: And for us to demo those wall, like the cost.
**Brian.schubert**: You know, we're trying to make this minimal versus just cutting through the epis, you know, reframing that out.
**Brian.schubert**: And that's why I want to look when I get there to see how that, you know, they.
**Brian.schubert**: They have a structure that runs across the top of those existing openings.
**Brian.schubert**: And depending on how that is configured, it may be somewhat easy to frame off of that, to frame for those transom windows, because you already got, like, a solid support straight across there.
**Brian.schubert**: And it might be easy for us to just frame those windows out and just get.
**Brian.schubert**: Get a look at it.
**Brian.schubert**: But I don't think it would look bad to have just a band of windows across the front and across the south and just skip where the Goodwill sign is.
**Brian.schubert**: You want that to be the ethos for the sign for it to go.
**Brian.schubert**: Andrew, I don't know what you think of that.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, yeah, that's fine.
**Jcurtin**: Just having a spot for that sign, just a cut out of EFIs, whatever that is, and then windows all across.
**Jdawson**: Really should Only replace if we're on the south of that glass there.
**Jdawson**: I mean, if we just basically take that six foot start at the.
**Jdawson**: What would be the top of the awning.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Right.
**Jdawson**: So we're cutting into that EFS kind of band there.
**Jdawson**: We can probably.
**Jdawson**: We could probably do that on the south side.
**Jdawson**: And then I would think beyond the.
**Jdawson**: On the east side, we've got a little bit more glass there to make up for, but it's probably a good starting negotiating point.
**Brian.schubert**: Okay.
**Brian.schubert**: And then we get credit for the glass that we're putting in.
**Brian.schubert**: Right.
**Brian.schubert**: For the new canopy, the donation canopy.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, I would think so.
**Brian.schubert**: And then that's why I'll get with, you know, when we're on site, a tape measure out, see how much we got to actually put in and then we can send it to you like Jerome.
**Brian.schubert**: Right?
**Brian.schubert**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I can change this really quickly for Obviously for the 10, I mean I took me 15 minutes or something.
**Jdawson**: Change it after this.
**Jdawson**: Then we can take a look at it and be ready for 11:00 clock call.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, that's where I would.
**Jcurtin**: I would start with them.
**Jcurtin**: It sounded like if we replaced the.
**Jcurtin**: What the square footage of windows was, then we won't have to do anything else.
**Jcurtin**: It brings it back to that grandfathered look.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, so yeah, that'd be.
**Jcurtin**: That'd be our preference for sure.
**Brian.schubert**: And we still have to do the awnings.
**Jcurtin**: Probably.
**Brian.schubert**: Yeah, I would think so.
**Brian.schubert**: Okay.
**Brian.schubert**: And is it a certain amount of awnings or is it there a number of them?
**Jdawson**: Right now what you're seeing on the elevation is exactly what was there previously.
**Brian.schubert**: So we just want to match it exactly.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I think the simplest thing for everything is just to get them same number, same location of awnings.
**Jdawson**: They can't complain about that.
**Jdawson**: And then the same square footage of glass as a starting point.
**Jdawson**: Knowing that on the.
**Jdawson**: What was previously that eastern storefront entrance, maybe keeping that with as CMU infill and we can, you know, make that argument and just say that we're going to replace that, you know, amount of glass a little bit on the northern side of that eastern elevation.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, that worked for me.
**Brian.schubert**: Yeah.
**Brian.schubert**: But we're getting rid of all like we're gonna do transoms on.
**Brian.schubert**: That's the east side too.
**Brian.schubert**: We're not putting the ones in.
**Brian.schubert**: Yeah, yeah.
**Brian.schubert**: Okay.
**Brian.schubert**: Yep.
**Brian.schubert**: All right.
**Jdawson**: On the east side, that goodwill sign that was on the blue Bay in there, Ariel Caymus.
**Jdawson**: Shrinking that or losing that, if that is going to be a lot of transom glass there.
**Jcurtin**: No, we want to Keep that.
**Jcurtin**: I don't know if I have the actual dimensions on what we're going to put up there or not.
**Jcurtin**: I can look for them real quick, though.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, we want to keep that.
**Jdawson**: Okay, well, let me see what I can do to try to just maximize the amount of glass transom that we get there.
**Brian.schubert**: Sure.
**Brian.schubert**: Hey, two.
**Brian.schubert**: Do you mind?
**Brian.schubert**: The canopy, if you could show that, Nick, what did that end up being?
**Brian.schubert**: Is it about a 2 foot wide?
**Brian.schubert**: Is it 3 foot, like the edge of the canopy?
**Brian.schubert**: The new one, the roofer.
**Amulder**: The roofer needed a minimum of 8 inches, so I'm thinking like a foot and a half.
**Brian.schubert**: That's all the wider that is.
**Amulder**: Yeah.
**Amulder**: You're talking about the height.
**Amulder**: The height of the parapet.
**Brian.schubert**: Well, the parapet, but what does that whole profile look like?
**Brian.schubert**: So we can slam it on this drawing.
**Brian.schubert**: We're done with it, we'll know exactly where it is, what this looks like on the side of that building.
**Brian.schubert**: I don't know if you think it would help, but if like on the lower elevation, if you showed that canopy sticking out from the building.
**Brian.schubert**: It is, I don't know if that.
**Jdawson**: Is on the south elevation to show that.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Brian.schubert**: Yeah, yeah.
**Brian.schubert**: But the, the width of that's going to be like two and a half feet maybe, and it's going to fall in.
**Brian.schubert**: I don't know if we got exactly where that falls in to the side, which I'll.
**Brian.schubert**: Like I said, I'll be on site in just a minute.
**Brian.schubert**: Get you all these dimensions on where to put your.
**Brian.schubert**: Where to put these all on the side of the building for our meeting.
**Jdawson**: The two and a half feet that you're talking about, is that.
**Jdawson**: Are you talking about kind of the, the height of the top of that canopy?
**Brian.schubert**: Yeah, from like the bottom of the ceiling to the top of the parapet wall, like that dimension.
**Brian.schubert**: I'll get you that.
**Brian.schubert**: And then it's probably going to start like.
**Brian.schubert**: I think it starts like right above that white band, like where the blue will be, like the bottom of the ceiling.
**Brian.schubert**: And then it'll go up from there, say two and a half feet.
**Jdawson**: I'm guessing it's probably just taking what we have there and dropping it down.
**Brian.schubert**: I just was.
**Jdawson**: I was referencing the steel photograph, the photo with the steel in there for that.
**Jdawson**: So if there is a little bit of a drop there, that's probably.
**Jdawson**: That will probably be about that two and a half feet on this.
**Brian.schubert**: Okay.
**Amulder**: Okay.
**Amulder**: Should we meet that back at 10:45?
**Amulder**: If.
**Amulder**: Jerome, you said you, you can get an elevation put together.
**Jdawson**: Let me do it real quick.
**Jdawson**: I'll send it out to the same email there and then see, make sure that we are really close on the square footage.
**Brian.schubert**: Okay.
**Amulder**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Is there anything on the north side?
**Jdawson**: We don't have that elevation, but is that something where, if we want to try to, you know, if we need to add a little bit of transom there.
**Jdawson**: I know it's not meeting the exact intent, but I would.
**Jcurtin**: No, no, there's nothing on that side.
**Jdawson**: If we have to add some transm there, you know, if we aren't getting that square footage that we need, is that something that we want to try to do?
**Jcurtin**: I don't think so.
**Jcurtin**: I think they just want those because they're street facing.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah.
**Brian.schubert**: It's just.
**Jcurtin**: If they bring it up, we can look at it, but I.
**Brian.schubert**: Wouldn'T bring it up.
**Brian.schubert**: Do they allow you to, you know, add to a different wall to make up for what you take away?
**Brian.schubert**: If you want.
**Jdawson**: Not really meeting you 10.
**Jdawson**: I'm just trying to, like.
**Brian.schubert**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: Get us a little bit close, you know, try to figure out what our negotiation points are.
**Brian.schubert**: Yeah.
**Brian.schubert**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Again, really, the intent is just to try to get back to the original condition.
**Jdawson**: So they can't.
**Jdawson**: Because, I mean, now that it would.
**Jdawson**: If it was new, I mean, none of this would be working.
**Jcurtin**: Right.
**Brian.schubert**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: All right, Let me get this updated.
**Jdawson**: I'll get it up to everyone then.
**Jdawson**: Just meet again on this.
**Jdawson**: You want to send it on their call 1045.
**Amulder**: Okay.
**Amulder**: All right.
**Jdawson**: Get this done.
**Jdawson**: Back at you real quick.
**Jcurtin**: Thanks.
