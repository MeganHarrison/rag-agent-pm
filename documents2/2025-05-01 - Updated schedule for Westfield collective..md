**Ctragesser**: Hey, is Jesse on yet?
**Gducharme**: No, I don't think so.
**Ctragesser**: Okay.
**Ctragesser**: For some reason, dude, my computer is acting up.
**Gducharme**: Hold on.
**Gducharme**: The is my menu.
**Gducharme**: What am I talking to you about?
**Ctragesser**: It's not letting me join my computer.
**Gducharme**: All right, I couldn't hear you.
**Gducharme**: What was that?
**Ctragesser**: I said it's not letting me join on my computer.
**Gducharme**: Well, why not?
**Gducharme**: I don't know.
**Ctragesser**: I'm restarting my computer right now.
**Gducharme**: I promise you, I'm not the one you want to come do with tech problems, buddy.
**Ctragesser**: Just hit restart.
**Ctragesser**: That's all I know.
**Ctragesser**: Have you looked at the schedule since I've updated it?
**Gducharme**: No.
**Ctragesser**: Okay.
**Ctragesser**: I wonder if they'll let me join from both my phone and computer.
**Gducharme**: Yes, you can.
**Gducharme**: If you wanted to do that, you could.
**Ctragesser**: At least until I can get on here.
**Ctragesser**: You know what I mean?
**Ctragesser**: Jesse forgiven us.
**Gducharme**: Date.
**Gducharme**: This is still 415 step.
**Gducharme**: A computer can't save something while it's open.
**Gducharme**: Just change the name in both locations.
**Gducharme**: It's not that hard lines Structural Center.
**Gducharme**: Who needs our updated drawings and cads and stuff?
**Gducharme**: Miller.
**Ctragesser**: Miller.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Gducharme**: CNC and Mara, obviously, but yeah, they're on the email.
**Ctragesser**: Nick.
**Gducharme**: Nick's on the email.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Gducharme**: Anybody who's been.
**Gducharme**: Who's had anything to do with it, I think just.
**Gducharme**: I mean, I didn't put the surveyors on there, but yeah, I had the concrete team, the AG peer team, Nick, Joe, the JQOL team, and our team all on the cmail chain that's been going back and forth for days so that everybody was at least in the loop and knew that changes were coming down the line.
**Gducharme**: And then yesterday, it got to be so much that I just put that RFI together and consolidated it.
**Gducharme**: Was able to get Jericho on the phone.
**Gducharme**: Amazingly, this is a structural roller cells those all the way down.
**Ctragesser**: Yeah.
**Ctragesser**: I wonder if something's going on with teams, because I can't join.
**Ctragesser**: Excuse me?
**Ctragesser**: I can't join from my computer.
**Ctragesser**: I've never had that issue.
**Ctragesser**: And Jesse's not on.
**Gducharme**: I wonder if Jesse forgot that.
**Ctragesser**: I doubt he forgot.
**Ctragesser**: I mean, I had Maria check his schedule and she said, no, he's good at that time.
**Ctragesser**: And he's always.
**Ctragesser**: I mean, hell, he's always, you know, early riser of the group.
**Ctragesser**: There he is.
**Speaker 2**: I don't know what's up with my desktop version of Teams, but it does not work.
**Gducharme**: What the heck?
**Gducharme**: Mine worked fine using you and Chad both aren't working for once.
**Ctragesser**: That's why I had to go from my phone.
**Speaker 2**: Also, Jesse, it doesn't work on your computer.
**Ctragesser**: No, it works on my phone, but it will not let me do it from my computer.
**Ctragesser**: And I've even tried my high tech IT Abilities of just restarting the computer.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, well, I did this.
**Speaker 2**: You just have to do the online version instead of the desktop, so I don't know.
**Speaker 2**: Something's fucked.
**Ctragesser**: Yeah.
**Ctragesser**: So, no, Jess.
**Ctragesser**: Jesse, the reason I just.
**Ctragesser**: I just wanted to keep you updated, you know, with the schedule and everything of where everything's at and just kind of, you know, just not so much have this every week, but maybe every couple weeks check in with you, just, you know, pick your brain on some things.
**Ctragesser**: Also, I know, you know, we send out the daily reports, but I know you're busy, so there may be a lot of times you don't see the daily reports also.
**Ctragesser**: But, I mean, you know, we've got, you know, concrete's kind of slid since we're still waiting on a finalized contract with Merit Steel is kind of slid a little bit.
**Ctragesser**: So, I mean, everything slid a couple weeks on us, but we're still not as bad on the back end, I don't think.
**Ctragesser**: I think we still have room to make up time.
**Ctragesser**: So I did update one.
**Ctragesser**: There's a new schedule in there, 429.
**Ctragesser**: Brandon asked me to have you show me how to do Critical Path on it.
**Ctragesser**: That's something I've never done on the schedule.
**Ctragesser**: And I was just.
**Ctragesser**: I didn't know if you could, you know, take 10, 15 minutes this morning and kind of show me, you know, how you do that.
**Ctragesser**: He was explaining it to me, but he said to get with you.
**Speaker 2**: Okay.
**Speaker 2**: Do you have it opened up?
**Ctragesser**: I do not have it opened up.
**Ctragesser**: I was going to open it up, but, you know, and have it share my screen.
**Ctragesser**: But with me working off the phone, it's kind of pain.
**Ctragesser**: You want me to open or would you like to open it?
**Speaker 2**: We can look.
**Ctragesser**: Say that again.
**Ctragesser**: I lost you.
**Ctragesser**: Sorry.
**Gducharme**: No, nobody say anything.
**Ctragesser**: Oh, I thought Jesse said something.
**Gducharme**: Sorry, Sa.
**Gducharme**: Jesse, you're trying to get under your computer right now or something.
**Ctragesser**: I can't hear him.
**Ctragesser**: I just saw his mouth moving, too.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, we can't hear you, Jesse.
**Gducharme**: That's how you get out of a teams meeting, is just move your mouth a bunch and disconnect.
**Gducharme**: Well, meanwhile, while he's fixing his audio, we had a pretty big win yesterday with.
**Gducharme**: With that Chad getting that meeting done with Jerrica and then finally got us to stop kicking that can down the road of who's gonna.
**Gducharme**: Who's gonna update their drawings first so that we can get going.
**Gducharme**: Good, good.
**Gducharme**: And it was Jerrica.
**Ctragesser**: We should know something on the sanitary today.
**Ctragesser**: Whether we can use that lateral that's coming onto our property or.
**Ctragesser**: We gotta.
**Gducharme**: All right.
**Gducharme**: I just updated the drawings and pro in job planner to the new foundation set was updated in there.
**Gducharme**: I don't know why it keeps changing the order of this.
**Gducharme**: I've set the order of this to be civil, structural, architectural, MEPs so many times, but it just keeps reverting back to whatever the it wants.
**Ctragesser**: Jesse's gone.
**Gducharme**: Maybe we should start using zoom.
**Ctragesser**: Jesse's back.
**Gducharme**: Concrete.
**Ctragesser**: Sa.
**Ctragesser**: Since I'm on my phone.
**Ctragesser**: Glenn, you want to send him back?
**Ctragesser**: Just.
**Ctragesser**: Hey, we can do this tomorrow or something.
**Gducharme**: He can hear us.
**Gducharme**: Jesse, you could get on your phone also and then you could like talk on your phone and see the screen.
**Gducharme**: You can be on both.
**Ctragesser**: Well, I can't.
**Ctragesser**: It won't let me online.
**Gducharme**: Well, he's able to get on his desktop still.
**Gducharme**: Like you can't even get on your desktop.
**Ctragesser**: I can't get on desktop or the web based.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, but you can.
**Gducharme**: You're on here on your phone, on your app.
**Gducharme**: I'm saying he could get on his app and talk like you are, but he can also be on his computer.
**Gducharme**: But the audio is not working.
**Gducharme**: So he could just.
**Gducharme**: He could still see the screen and then hear through the phone.
**Gducharme**: I've had to do that before.
**Ctragesser**: The.
**Ctragesser**: This is what I get for trying to set up a meeting to keep everybody in communication.
**Gducharme**: Where.
**Gducharme**: Where is the schedule at?
**Gducharme**: I haven't even seen it.
**Gducharme**: Let me get this up so I can share.

**Gducharme**: Hold on.
**Gducharme**: Number eight.
**Gducharme**: Schedule.
**Gducharme**: There it is.
**Gducharme**: This is it that I need to update subcontracts.
**Gducharme**: I keep forgetting how to export this and save it as a PDF and not have it all up.
**Gducharme**: How did I do this one?
**Ctragesser**: This is great.
**Ctragesser**: Halloween.
**Gducharme**: It's pretty.
**Gducharme**: The hell.
**Ctragesser**: What was that?
**Gducharme**: That's me trying to get this schedule.
**Gducharme**: There's no dates.
**Gducharme**: I converted it to PDF and it just didn't do it at.
**Ctragesser**: What file were you at?
**Gducharme**: I'm in your.
**Gducharme**: I opened up your 429.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, I'm just trying to turn it into a PDF and I did, but it cut out all it.
**Gducharme**: It gave the task name and then went right to the.
**Gducharme**: Right to the Gantt chart.
**Gducharme**: It skipped all the like, dirty.
**Gducharme**: Well, it gave me the duration, but it skipped like the dates.
**Gducharme**: But this is skipping the dates here too.
**Gducharme**: What the hell?
**Gducharme**: Start, finish precessing, roll.
**Gducharme**: Why is it saying dates 2325-13126.
**Gducharme**: Your last date is 2626.
**Ctragesser**: Where are you at the very bottom?
**Gducharme**: No, I'm trying to print this thing and it's like giving me a date range.
**Gducharme**: I said print entire project from start to finish.
**Gducharme**: It's like dates 2325 to 1312 6.
**Gducharme**: I don't even see 13126 here at the end of the project anywhere.
**Gducharme**: Not even one of the dates.
**Ctragesser**: 2626 is the final.
**Gducharme**: I.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: Oh, that's taking the dates.
**Gducharme**: Okay, so we didn't even start until freaking April.
**Gducharme**: Okay, let's see.
**Gducharme**: Got it.
**Gducharme**: All right, that makes sense.
**Gducharme**: Landscape, temple, print.
**Ctragesser**: Dude, it literally just kicked me out of the meeting.
**Ctragesser**: I had to jump back in on my phone again.
**Gducharme**: What the.
**Gducharme**: What's going on with you guys?
**Ctragesser**: Hey, you know what?
**Ctragesser**: I'd be happy advise you for once.
**Ctragesser**: It's not your technology up.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, look at me going.
**Gducharme**: I'm saving stuff.
**Gducharme**: Making freaking PDFs out of Excel documents.
**Gducharme**: You guys are damn throwing stones at freaking wildebeests over there with your technology.
**Ctragesser**: Well, they got the structure 609 yesterday.
**Gducharme**: 609, huh?
**Ctragesser**: Yep.
**Ctragesser**: So they're just about wrapped up.
**Ctragesser**: A storm ain't got a whole lot left.
**Gducharme**: Where is 609?
**Gducharme**: Oh, all the way to that corner.
**Gducharme**: Holy.
**Ctragesser**: Yeah.
**Gducharme**: All right, so I had a question.
**Gducharme**: We.
**Gducharme**: Oh, you know what?
**Gducharme**: It was those two.
**Gducharme**: So we didn't have to put an animal guard at structure 601.
**Ctragesser**: Yeah, we do.
**Gducharme**: We do.
**Gducharme**: It just.
**Gducharme**: It doesn't come like that.
**Ctragesser**: No, no.
**Ctragesser**: Yeah, it's a bolt on.
**Gducharme**: All right.
**Gducharme**: We.
**Gducharme**: There's three of those total.
**Ctragesser**: They'll do that.
**Ctragesser**: They'll drop back and they'll do that when they're done.
**Ctragesser**: Like their storm inlet production, like putting their bags over everything.
**Ctragesser**: So no dirt washes in until you.
**Gducharme**: Said they already went and regraded out the rip wrap all and all that down there.
**Ctragesser**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: Cool.
**Gducharme**: All right, so today they got that and reshaped it.
**Gducharme**: They're gonna get 610 in and then what go up there and do.
**Gducharme**: Is that 6 11.
**Gducharme**: That one under the.
**Gducharme**: That was under that pad.
**Gducharme**: Speaking of that, we got Jesse here.
**Gducharme**: Whenever he gets on, we can ask him who the had these guys to take this off.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, 611 was the one up there under the pad.
**Ctragesser**: So if you go to our job folder.
**Ctragesser**: Right.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, I saw that actually Permit set, civil marked up progress drawings.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, so I just.
**Ctragesser**: I kind of just.
**Ctragesser**: I just highlight where they're at that way, you know, if somebody sends you a bill, you can hey.
**Ctragesser**: And I'm gonna start adding dates to it.
**Ctragesser**: So that way, you know, at this date they were here.
**Ctragesser**: You know what I mean?
**Gducharme**: Oh, so.
**Gducharme**: Yes.
**Gducharme**: What is this?
**Gducharme**: Yesterday they stopped at 608 and today they're already at 609?
**Ctragesser**: No, yesterday they got to 609.
**Gducharme**: Oh, so you didn't update this one?
**Ctragesser**: No, I just updated this morning, but then I.
**Ctragesser**: When I was restarting my computer, I didn't save it, so it reverted it.
**Gducharme**: Oh, let's see.
**Gducharme**: Well, we don't need all of these drawings in here, right?
**Gducharme**: I mean, I guess we can use them later.
**Ctragesser**: Yeah, we.
**Gducharme**: I could take out a handful of these drawings that are never going to get marked up through the demo set can go road striping will keep utility plan and profiles will keep those.
**Gducharme**: I don't know why.
**Gducharme**: Actually, we don't need any of those that way we just have stuff in here that will actually ever mark up.
**Gducharme**: And we're going to mark up this mask readiness swipe, post construction swipe.
**Ctragesser**: We have Jesse back or no.
**Gducharme**: All right, cool.
**Gducharme**: Now we just have a few pages in there we'll mark up.
**Gducharme**: Look at the landscaping.
**Gducharme**: I left the landscaping in there.
**Gducharme**: That'll be a good one to mark up.
**Gducharme**: Storm utility line has our course all our sanitary and water line that we can mark up on here.
**Gducharme**: Electrical.
**Gducharme**: So we have the one transformer.
**Gducharme**: So.
**Gducharme**: So does Duke come out and they bring power to that transformer?
**Ctragesser**: Yeah.
**Ctragesser**: So we'll have to bring power from the other side of the road straight up to where that transformer goes.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Gducharme**: Who does that, us or Duke?
**Ctragesser**: That will be, I believe, Duke.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, Duke.
**Gducharme**: Duke powers their the transformer.
**Gducharme**: Right.
**Gducharme**: And then we take it from there.
**Ctragesser**: Yes.
**Gducharme**: Regardless of the transformers on the property or if it's like one on a corner.
**Ctragesser**: Normally you have your own transformers each.
**Ctragesser**: Each building.
**Gducharme**: Okay, so there would be a primary and secondary then.
**Ctragesser**: Well, the primary is coming to the transform.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, but there's a.
**Gducharme**: There's a box or a hub somewhere that that's coming out of.
**Ctragesser**: That'd be on the other side of the road, I'm assuming.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, I don't.
**Ctragesser**: I've not seen the electrical, how this is being loaded yet.
**Gducharme**: Well, I don't know.
**Gducharme**: Jesse's gonna keep trying to get back on or what?
**Ctragesser**: I will take.
**Ctragesser**: This is our 30 minute catch up meeting every morning.
**Ctragesser**: I gotta go put the time lapse camera up, but I gotta figure out how it works.
**Ctragesser**: AJ thinks I just have to scan a QR code on it then download an app.
**Gducharme**: So.
**Ctragesser**: Install it today.
**Gducharme**: So they're just putting in storm today at the design meeting here in a little bit pretty much we're gonna be.
**Ctragesser**: Able to probably start dropping read with citizens was on vacation yesterday.
**Ctragesser**: He's the guy that's going to be able to tell us what we can do with the sanitary which if you look at photos.
**Gducharme**: Ready your daily report yet, see what's got going on from yesterday.
**Gducharme**: But if I read that you wouldn't have to tell me all this, huh?
**Ctragesser**: No, because I didn't do my daily.
**Ctragesser**: I didn't finish my daily flu this morning because Dave didn't send me his quantities.
**Ctragesser**: Dude, they stayed till almost 9 o'clock last night doing storm.
**Gducharme**: Why?
**Ctragesser**: Hey, I don't give a let them.
**Gducharme**: They're just on a roll.
**Ctragesser**: I don't pay them by the hour, you know what I mean?
**Speaker 3**: Yeah.
**Ctragesser**: So if you look at the second one on if you go to like the actual OneDrive.
**Gducharme**: So 7 to 608 is now complete.
**Gducharme**: They continued out of 608 to 609.
**Gducharme**: 68ft 20 minutes.
**Gducharme**: Installed structure 608.
**Gducharme**: 600.
**Gducharme**: I can go to what one of the pictures not on the report?
**Ctragesser**: No, you can, it's on the report also.
**Gducharme**: Which one is it?
**Ctragesser**: The guys down in the hole with the shot with the.
**Ctragesser**: The Aquabac.
**Ctragesser**: Okay, you see that lateral down there?
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Ctragesser**: So it's running right at that structure that's right behind the aqua back hose.
**Ctragesser**: You can see the structure in the background.
**Ctragesser**: You see it?
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Ctragesser**: And then right you see how there's kind of like a shelf there, Like.
**Gducharme**: A dirt shelf to off his left elbow.
**Gducharme**: No, no, no.
**Ctragesser**: In front of him like where he's backing at about 3ft in front of where he's backing at is a.
**Ctragesser**: Another you smell main that is running east west and it's like a 15 inch main.
**Gducharme**: A sanitary.
**Ctragesser**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: What?
**Speaker 3**: A 15 inch main.
**Speaker 3**: Sanitary in the road.
**Gducharme**: So between him and the structure.
**Ctragesser**: Yeah.
**Ctragesser**: So they went to tie in yesterday to the sanitary to get it exposed so they could core it.
**Ctragesser**: And we found a sanitary lateral coming onto our property.
**Ctragesser**: And then we found a huge.
**Ctragesser**: That they believe is a forced main.
**Ctragesser**: Sanitary running east west.
**Ctragesser**: That's right.
**Ctragesser**: That the sanitary.
**Ctragesser**: We found the lateral.
**Ctragesser**: It dives underneath.
**Speaker 3**: Chad, do you know how to use Bluebeam?
**Ctragesser**: Yes.
**Speaker 3**: Okay, because I would like a marked up drawing.
**Speaker 3**: Can you see the screen?
**Gducharme**: This is his market.
**Gducharme**: The sub daily where we get to utilities.
**Speaker 3**: Right, I get that.
**Speaker 3**: But what I want is like.
**Speaker 3**: So we're Right here.
**Speaker 3**: Correct.
**Speaker 3**: This is what we're talking about.
**Gducharme**: Oh, no, we're right here.
**Gducharme**: His computer's up and Jesse's his tooth somehow.
**Gducharme**: So for once it's not mine.
**Gducharme**: We're actually here.
**Gducharme**: But it didn't save.
**Speaker 3**: Okay, so.
**Gducharme**: So this, right.
**Gducharme**: We're talking about down here, the sanitary.
**Gducharme**: Sanitary time.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: Southeast corner.
**Gducharme**: So.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, that's what I was asking.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, we're working right, right here.
**Gducharme**: So there's that structure.
**Gducharme**: So this is where he was vacuum out.
**Gducharme**: Pretty much.
**Speaker 3**: And so we, so there's a.
**Speaker 3**: You're saying that there's somewhere in this area there's a existing force main.
**Speaker 3**: You said it's 46 inches.
**Ctragesser**: No, no, no.
**Ctragesser**: It's probably 14 to 16 inch.
**Speaker 3**: Oh, I was like.
**Speaker 3**: I, I thought you said 46.
**Speaker 3**: I was like, that's impossible.
**Speaker 3**: But I think that's just the existing.
**Gducharme**: 10 PVC that's running.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, that's, that's probably the sanitary here.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: So it's, it's, it's, it's probably this line right here that you're seeing, right?
**Ctragesser**: Yes.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Speaker 3**: And so, so that, that's there.
**Speaker 3**: And that's, that's.
**Speaker 3**: This ties into this structure, correct?
**Ctragesser**: No, that runs past the structure.
**Ctragesser**: That 10 inch does not tie in.
**Speaker 3**: Okay.
**Speaker 3**: And so, so you.
**Speaker 3**: We're tied into this structure.
**Speaker 3**: So where is there the force main you're talking about?
**Ctragesser**: That's that 10 inch existing.
**Ctragesser**: That they, well, they thought it was a 10 inch.
**Ctragesser**: It's bigger than 10, I can tell you that.
**Ctragesser**: What we were running into was if you go to the existing page demo, you'll see where it says that, you know, that there was a pipe that was capped.
**Ctragesser**: Possibly existing sanitary, I think it says or something like that, but they weren't sure.
**Ctragesser**: It is horizontal PVC pipe cap.
**Ctragesser**: Possible sanitary.
**Ctragesser**: Lateral.
**Speaker 3**: So I'm on, I'm on the existing.
**Speaker 3**: So C102.
**Ctragesser**: Yep.
**Ctragesser**: So scroll, zoom in, zoom in by that number six.
**Ctragesser**: It's got two arrows above you.
**Ctragesser**: Go up.
**Speaker 3**: It's gas light right there.
**Ctragesser**: Yep.
**Ctragesser**: Nope, nope.
**Ctragesser**: The note to the top left of.
**Speaker 3**: That original PVC capped possible sanitary letter.
**Speaker 3**: Okay.
**Ctragesser**: So it goes from where it's X there, we think on the drawing down to that SS in the bottom right hand corner of your screen right now.
**Ctragesser**: Yes, that's what we're seeing that as right now.
**Speaker 2**: Chad, don't give up on trying to restart your computer.
**Ctragesser**: So I haven't given up yet, Jesse.
**Speaker 3**: So that, that line is, you know, pretty close to where our line goes.
**Gducharme**: Right.
**Speaker 3**: It's running Pretty much parallel, right?
**Ctragesser**: Yes.
**Gducharme**: We're trying to tie into it which citizens guy was on vacation yesterday that could approve that.
**Speaker 3**: Trying to tie into this existing line.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Gducharme**: Instead of going all the way.
**Gducharme**: Because all these other util facilities are down here too.
**Gducharme**: So we can.
**Gducharme**: It's.
**Gducharme**: It's pretty much the same fall.
**Gducharme**: So.
**Speaker 3**: That looks about five feet, right?
**Speaker 3**: This is the line he's talking about.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, but you look at the invert on that other one, it's like seven or eight foot deep.
**Speaker 2**: I don't think you're deep enough to get all the way to the building.
**Speaker 2**: That's the problem.
**Speaker 2**: So look at your invert on the structure table for the like this sanitary structure.
**Gducharme**: I think it's.
**Gducharme**: Oh, you're on the markup.
**Gducharme**: Go to our full set.
**Gducharme**: There's only pages that we're going to mark up on that set.
**Speaker 3**: Gotcha.
**Speaker 2**: There you go.
**Speaker 2**: So go to that manhole.
**Speaker 3**: Well, this is what this is Storm.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: I'm looking for sanitary.
**Speaker 3**: Well, structure SS3.
**Speaker 3**: This is.
**Speaker 2**: It says on there too.
**Speaker 2**: Look at, if you zoom in, invert.893.
**Speaker 3**: That's SS4.
**Speaker 3**: So.
**Speaker 3**: Oh, this one right here.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah.
**Gducharme**: 893.
**Speaker 2**: 893.
**Speaker 3**: And this is 893.9.
**Speaker 2**: And so what's the grade out there?
**Gducharme**: That means between 900 and 902 everywhere.
**Speaker 3**: 902.
**Speaker 2**: Yes.
**Speaker 2**: You're nine foot, eight foot, nine foot deep.
**Speaker 2**: And if that existing is only five, you're just not deep enough.
**Ctragesser**: So the existing.
**Ctragesser**: When it goes out there, Jesse, it 45s big time deep.
**Ctragesser**: We could not get an actual depth on it because they didn't want to.
**Ctragesser**: United said, well, let's get an answer from citizens number one what they want.
**Speaker 2**: But what size is it though?
**Speaker 2**: Like what size is that?
**Ctragesser**: That is a six or eight.
**Ctragesser**: I believe that's an eight was what that was.
**Speaker 2**: They had an eight inch sewer line going to a house.
**Speaker 2**: That's crazy.
**Speaker 3**: Well, and they had septic.
**Speaker 3**: So maybe that was why the septic.
**Gducharme**: Was over at the other house.
**Speaker 2**: I mean if it.
**Speaker 2**: You can use it, great.
**Speaker 2**: You don't have to tap in the manhole and you can save some money.
**Ctragesser**: But that's, that's what we're.
**Ctragesser**: Yeah, that's what we're trying to shoot for on that.
**Gducharme**: What is the new sewer?
**Speaker 2**: What's the newer supposed to be?
**Speaker 2**: The new sewer line, is it 6 inch or 8 inch?
**Speaker 3**: It is new.
**Gducharme**: Is 8 SS2 8 inch to 8 inch?
**Speaker 3**: 6 inch?
**Gducharme**: No, 6.
**Speaker 2**: 6 inch.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: What is.
**Speaker 2**: Is it Ductile iron clay top.
**Speaker 2**: It's pvc.
**Speaker 3**: It's pvc, which is what's existing, too.
**Speaker 2**: Existing line.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: Where did you say there was a force main at, Chad?
**Ctragesser**: That's the one that we believe is running east and west.
**Speaker 3**: Oh, that's that, that's that 10 inch.
**Ctragesser**: On the drawings it says 10.
**Ctragesser**: Yes.
**Ctragesser**: But if that's.
**Ctragesser**: Wow.
**Ctragesser**: Yes.
**Speaker 3**: I can tell you how big six inches is.
**Speaker 3**: I know that back of my hand, but 10, I'm not sure.
**Gducharme**: Look at the back of it.
**Ctragesser**: If they're calling that 10 inches, then your 6 inches just became about 2 inches.
**Ctragesser**: Dude.
**Speaker 3**: Story of my life.
**Ctragesser**: How's the leg?
**Speaker 3**: It's better.
**Speaker 3**: I, you know, I just, you know, I don't have to get surgery, which is good.
**Speaker 3**: So I just, you know, trying to get up and move around and stuff and, you know, just prevent scar tissue from hardening.
**Gducharme**: So he's not even limping.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah.
**Ctragesser**: You coming out to play volleyball later?
**Speaker 3**: It's raining.
**Gducharme**: It's never raining.
**Speaker 3**: And if it wasn't, I still wouldn't go.
**Ctragesser**: I don't blame you.
**Speaker 3**: All right, so right here.
**Speaker 3**: So this manhole top, turn, invert 10 inch PVC 893C, 893 East.
**Speaker 3**: So there's the E, west, west.
**Speaker 3**: So, yeah, that, that pipe's got to tie into this, right?
**Ctragesser**: The 10 inch or the 6 inch.
**Speaker 3**: The 6 inch, the existing one that.
**Ctragesser**: You were calling this one the 6 inch, comes up to about maybe it's about 2 to 3ft before the structure.
**Ctragesser**: And that's where your 10 inch is running east west.
**Ctragesser**: And it dives 45 degree angle down big time, and then ties into the structure.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: I mean, Jesse, I would think that we could.
**Speaker 3**: Couldn't we just give Ashton a call and be like, hey, can we tie into this?
**Gducharme**: Ashton knows we're trying.
**Ctragesser**: So.
**Ctragesser**: Yeah, I mean, you're trying.
**Gducharme**: The guy, the guy from Citizens needs to approve it because they found when we're.
**Gducharme**: When they're going through our permit process, they said, hey, there's an old house here that we never had a permit pulled for a sanitary disconnect.
**Gducharme**: Have you guys found one and what do you plan to do with it?
**Gducharme**: So it's fine.
**Gducharme**: We're going to terminate it.
**Gducharme**: And then I found is like, well, we could actually probably tie into this.
**Gducharme**: Let's call Citizens and say we found it.
**Gducharme**: See if we could tie into it.
**Gducharme**: Like Chad is saying, it goes.
**Gducharme**: And if it drops under that other 10 inch, then that's going to get.
**Gducharme**: That's going to get that extra drop to get into the invert of there.
**Gducharme**: What Jesse was saying, we're a few feet off, but if it drops two feet.
**Ctragesser**: Yeah.
**Gducharme**: So he's coming.
**Gducharme**: It's dropping into that 10 inch.
**Ctragesser**: The gentleman that can make that decision, whether or not we can tie it, use that core and not have to recour the structure.
**Ctragesser**: He's.
**Ctragesser**: He's back in the office today.
**Ctragesser**: So hopefully we get an answer from.
**Gducharme**: Them on that where somebody was talking about there was a T at this.
**Gducharme**: Did you guys think there was a t?
**Gducharme**: Because that 10 was crossing.
**Gducharme**: It turned out to not be.
**Ctragesser**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: Okay.
**Ctragesser**: There's no T in.
**Speaker 3**: All right, so what any.
**Speaker 3**: Do we have any questions on it or.
**Ctragesser**: No, no, no.
**Gducharme**: This wasn't what we were talking about.
**Gducharme**: Oh, I just had that up because he was showing me about the daily report yesterday when you walked in.
**Speaker 2**: We already have it all.
**Gducharme**: This is already.
**Speaker 2**: So they'll just save the tapping and I don't know if they had to do a pump around for that manhole while they're doing the work to grouted in.
**Speaker 2**: I mean, you should save some money.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, we would save a couple thousand for the tapping.
**Ctragesser**: It would save us the tap.
**Ctragesser**: It would save us the grout, and it also save us probably having to bring in a man box to put around that while they're doing the core and everything.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: Did they break that apart in their proposal?
**Speaker 2**: So you know what it's worth?
**Gducharme**: I.
**Gducharme**: I'd have to.
**Gducharme**: I'd have to look.
**Gducharme**: Well, the tap is a permit thing.
**Gducharme**: It's not.
**Gducharme**: It's not united.
**Gducharme**: That.
**Gducharme**: That's something that citizens is that link that I'm waiting for for them to pay.
**Speaker 2**: It's not the permit.
**Speaker 2**: What I'm saying is they've given us all these tickets for money.
**Speaker 2**: Now I would find out what that's worth in their quote to tap because they would have to go and core into the manhole, install that pipe, do a pump around.
**Speaker 2**: Like it's a whole process.
**Speaker 2**: Because you can't be like working in a manhole with flowing through it.
**Speaker 2**: So, like all of those things that we can negotiate.
**Speaker 2**: Some of these tickets they got to us.
**Gducharme**: I mean, they're not sending us any out of.
**Gducharme**: They're not sending us any wild tickets.
**Gducharme**: It'll say R5 on it.
**Speaker 2**: Every one of them's wild.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah.
**Gducharme**: Are you kidding me, though?
**Speaker 2**: Counting the drain line, $67,000 worth of uncovered change orders out there.
**Speaker 2**: I mean, it's a lot.
**Gducharme**: It.
**Gducharme**: It was the 67,000.
**Gducharme**: They.
**Speaker 2**: There's only like 20 on your PSR.
**Speaker 2**: That's what's written down.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, that, that's all kinds of stuff though, like we talked about when the other day.
**Gducharme**: I mean, that's the permits that we've paid that haven't been paid back.
**Gducharme**: That's, that's all, that's all of those things you said to account for.
**Gducharme**: United is right at probably just under 20,000.
**Speaker 3**: So I mean, here's their breakout.
**Speaker 3**: 6,000 for tying into sanitary structure.
**Speaker 3**: So we can save that 6 inch 26 sewer lateral, so 433ft Feet.
**Speaker 3**: So whatever you can just take that linear foot cost and get a credit off that clean ounce.
**Speaker 3**: I don't think we're saving anything there.
**Speaker 3**: And then I don't know what you'll save on the, on the backfill because they're still probably backfilling it.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: So we just say.
**Speaker 2**: Their change ordered stuff is not anything we can get a change order for.
**Speaker 2**: It was all on the drawings.
**Gducharme**: The, the drain line taking out the, taking out that drain all the way across the farm.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: Well, did we have the, all the specs and the city comments, like.
**Speaker 2**: I'm just telling you what most owners would tell you to go fly a kite.
**Speaker 3**: I mean, yeah, there's, there's, there's some of it that we have to eat like, you know, for sure now.
**Speaker 3**: There's some of it that I've already told Mike, you know, like some of the fire line and whatnot that they're gonna pay for.
**Speaker 3**: But yeah, like there was like, you know, that, that one change for like 15 or 20 grand for, you know, they had an ad for what like that just wasn't caught or wasn't called out.
**Speaker 3**: Like the demo of the footers, the.
**Speaker 3**: All that kind of stuff, like all that we're currently eating.
**Speaker 3**: So.
**Speaker 3**: Yes, that was in the change orders.
**Gducharme**: Did you talk to him about that then?
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, I talked to him about what change orders that I'm going to, I expect payment on.
**Speaker 3**: He agreed.
**Speaker 3**: And that's what I like.
**Speaker 2**: Those footers, they show that chunk of concrete right on the plan we were just looking at.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, yeah, they showed some of them, but we didn't call it out in their contract.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, so, but yeah, I mean, so essentially, I mean again, we should pick up six grand here and then whatever that linear footage is, you know, so you've got, you got a calculator in here?
**Gducharme**: Let's use my phone.
**Speaker 2**: I've got 150 bucks a foot.
**Speaker 3**: Yep.
**Speaker 3**: So yeah, I don't know how many feet that pipe Is.
**Speaker 3**: But should save a.
**Speaker 3**: Save a little bit.
**Speaker 3**: That's a pretty good distance.
**Ctragesser**: Yeah.
**Ctragesser**: I mean minimum.
**Ctragesser**: Lee at least saved the tie in.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: So yeah, I mean we could definitely pick up 10, 15 grand, which is great.
**Gducharme**: So, so good.
**Gducharme**: The plans, these other ones were not.
**Gducharme**: And then Jesse, if you go, go up to the volleyball courts, Jesse, if you see this number one here, foreign demolish building, remove complete.
**Gducharme**: That had the buildings and it pointed to the pad and apparently somebody told him to take that out of the estimate to that they weren't going to building.
**Gducharme**: So they removed the entire note.
**Gducharme**: Huh?
**Speaker 2**: Well, the owner said they were removing the buildings.
**Speaker 2**: I, I thought that was a.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, they were always taking care of that.
**Gducharme**: They did, they did.
**Gducharme**: But the problem is the buildings, the twitters.
**Gducharme**: No, the problem is that little concrete pad was attached to that note number one.
**Gducharme**: And when they removed that note from their estimate, that pad was part of that.
**Gducharme**: And so now they asked for two hour change order to take that out there or T M.
**Gducharme**: And Chad was like the.
**Gducharme**: You get.
**Gducharme**: You were there for 45 minutes.
**Gducharme**: No.
**Gducharme**: Well, every time we come with a ticket, you know there's going to be an issue.
**Gducharme**: Like guys, you have to put a storm structure in there.
**Gducharme**: It's on the demo plans.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, but you had us take it out.
**Gducharme**: Like okay, I didn't have that conversation with you.
**Ctragesser**: Well, it's also.
**Gducharme**: So we went back and looked and yeah, it did come out again.
**Speaker 3**: Like when he said Chad sends a ticket, he's saying yes, I confirmed this is agreed at this time.
**Speaker 3**: And so it's like when you say ticket, here you go.
**Speaker 3**: It's four guys, two hours.
**Speaker 3**: Like really.
**Speaker 3**: Because you had one guy for 45 minutes and that's exactly what you should.
**Gducharme**: Be doing by having a ticket in the first place to remove that pad is, is, is where we had an issue.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: Just like the rest of the footers.
**Speaker 3**: Again, we didn't put it in the, in their contract.
**Speaker 3**: And you know, it's just, it's ambiguous.
**Speaker 3**: Like it's on us.
**Speaker 3**: I mean if we look at their contract.
**Speaker 2**: Well, like that one's an easy one.
**Speaker 2**: The owner says they're going to take care of all the existing buildings we took.
**Gducharme**: But it's not the building, it's the concrete pad.
**Speaker 2**: I know, but the same part.
**Speaker 2**: Then you just take that as a contingency thing.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, it's not, it's not part of the building.
**Gducharme**: It's just either way.
**Speaker 3**: Yes, that's fine.
**Speaker 3**: But yes.
**Speaker 3**: So the whole point of this conversation is that we can get some money back to eat up some of these change orders that we are currently eating.
**Ctragesser**: Yeah, correct.
**Ctragesser**: Yes.
**Ctragesser**: So fingers crossed we get good news from citizens that they say, yeah, you don't have to record that structure.
**Ctragesser**: Go for it.
**Gducharme**: So I.
**Gducharme**: I feel like by storm, all RCP storm structure inlets, casting is required for contract documents.
**Gducharme**: Covers the fact that you have to take that out to structure 611.
**Gducharme**: Goes right in, right underneath that.
**Gducharme**: He's like, yeah, that's fine.
**Gducharme**: But you guys specifically told us to take this note out of these buildings.
**Speaker 3**: Have they.
**Speaker 3**: Have they installed structure 611 yet?
**Gducharme**: No, probably today or tomorrow.
**Speaker 3**: So, I mean, last one to put it in.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, it's just like they've already tore.
**Gducharme**: The pad out, though.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, I mean.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, I mean, I guess it didn't matter.
**Speaker 3**: I would have probably been like, all right, well, go ahead and put the structure in.
**Ctragesser**: All right.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: Like, I mean, you're right.
**Speaker 3**: Leave the pad there and go underneath it.
**Speaker 3**: But, like, your contract to put the structure in.
**Speaker 3**: You saw that there, you know, nowhere did it say removed by others.
**Speaker 3**: It didn't call it in your contract.
**Speaker 3**: It said, put in that structure.
**Speaker 3**: Like, guess what?
**Speaker 3**: It shows a sanitary line that goes right here.
**Speaker 3**: It does not explicitly say, dig a hole, put pipe in, connect glue.
**Speaker 3**: Like, how detailed do we have to get here, guys?
**Speaker 3**: But that's what I would have said.
**Speaker 3**: You know, it's like, all right, don't demo the whole thing.
**Speaker 3**: Demo what you need to.
**Speaker 3**: To put in your.
**Speaker 3**: To do your work.
**Speaker 3**: You know, I don't say.
**Speaker 3**: I don't say you include gas in your equipment.
**Speaker 3**: Right.
**Speaker 3**: But you have to have it.
**Speaker 3**: So there's, you know, at some point, there's a certain.
**Gducharme**: I mean, I agree.
**Gducharme**: We said we're not going to do the buildings.
**Gducharme**: And was there.
**Gducharme**: So I think they.
**Gducharme**: Oh, what?
**Gducharme**: I.
**Speaker 2**: Never mind.
**Speaker 2**: I'm gonna see.
**Speaker 2**: Have Andrew go over and get the meter numbers for the.
**Speaker 3**: Foundation.
**Speaker 2**: Foundation.
**Speaker 2**: Denise needs them.
**Speaker 3**: Be nice.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: All right.
**Speaker 3**: Do you guys need anything else?
**Speaker 3**: I need to talk to you about this change order.
**Ctragesser**: I'm good.
**Gducharme**: We haven't even gotten started.
**Speaker 3**: All right, well, real quick, looking at this.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Speaker 3**: So can you, like.
**Speaker 3**: So you sent me this.
**Speaker 3**: Like, this is not in division order.
**Speaker 3**: So you got foundations and masonry.
**Gducharme**: I put it in order.
**Gducharme**: So, like, if you hit your Costco there and flip the order, you can do that and try to save it.
**Gducharme**: But it will.
**Gducharme**: It won't put it in any order.
**Gducharme**: This is the order of.
**Gducharme**: I input it in.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Speaker 3**: And why, like, can you not combine these two into Division 8 instead of having two different line items like that.
**Gducharme**: I mean, I could.
**Gducharme**: I just broke.
**Gducharme**: I broke them out because that's what they are.
**Speaker 3**: Right, but remember how I said we need to match the prime schedule values?
**Gducharme**: That is because that's how the line item is.
**Gducharme**: Well, I can only put a line item in there that exists in the.
**Speaker 3**: Budget, so you can't make it one.
**Speaker 2**: I could.
**Gducharme**: I could make it one in the total and just not have the other line item, but I.
**Gducharme**: But it's.
**Gducharme**: It.
**Gducharme**: If we're taking that off the schedule of values, then it should.
**Gducharme**: It should track that money.
**Gducharme**: Right.
**Gducharme**: When we do this, change order.
**Speaker 3**: Okay, never mind.
**Speaker 3**: I see.
**Speaker 3**: I see what you're talking about.
**Ctragesser**: So.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: So then if you.
**Speaker 3**: So if you put it in order like that, you can't just.
**Speaker 3**: Okay, put in a thing to.
**Speaker 3**: That's a glitch.
**Speaker 3**: I'll put anything to jump here.
**Gducharme**: You have what you need otherwise, then.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: All right.
**Gducharme**: Now we can check out Chad's schedule.
**Gducharme**: Chad, is your computer working?
**Ctragesser**: No.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Ctragesser**: Still will not let me.
**Gducharme**: I'll pull up the schedule.
**Gducharme**: I just saved a PDF of it.
**Gducharme**: You want to look at that or do you want the.
**Ctragesser**: I don't care.
**Ctragesser**: However you'd like to do it.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Gducharme**: Jesse.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, Jesse, which one do you want up?
**Gducharme**: You want the Excel sheet.
**Speaker 2**: Or the schedule?
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: No, don't you have it in project?
**Gducharme**: Yeah, well, yeah, sorry.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, it's probably this project, but which screen is it?
**Gducharme**: There we go.
**Gducharme**: All right.
**Gducharme**: Chad did this.
**Gducharme**: I'm.
**Gducharme**: I'm driving pilot, so I don't.
**Gducharme**: So where's our.
**Gducharme**: Is there a way for this.
**Gducharme**: To do this, Jesse, without having to do this every time it collapses?
**Gducharme**: This stuff finished.
**Gducharme**: Was all collapsed.
**Speaker 2**: I don't know.
**Gducharme**: All right, Chad, take it away.
**Gducharme**: What's our big changes here?
**Ctragesser**: That's last.
**Ctragesser**: Our two biggest changes is the metal building is now not showing up till June 9.
**Ctragesser**: June 16.
**Ctragesser**: He possibly said that it will start showing up June 9, but he doesn't know what will be showing up.
**Ctragesser**: He believes columns and frames start showing up June 16, so that puts them almost out to setting on June 23.
**Ctragesser**: The other big one that pushed out on us is the concrete, since we're still working on getting a contract to merit.
**Ctragesser**: Correct.
**Gducharme**: I mean, not necessarily that, but the foundation plan needed to be finalized so that they could even start.
**Gducharme**: I could have gotten them a contract, but it done us no good.
**Gducharme**: We still have to go through rebar shop drawings and all that stuff.
**Gducharme**: So that's.
**Gducharme**: That's really what the hold up is.
**Speaker 2**: So didn't you get an RFI out, get it responded to?
**Gducharme**: I did.
**Gducharme**: It is, yeah.
**Gducharme**: Yesterday and we got everything resolved.
**Gducharme**: We had a big push yesterday.
**Gducharme**: We got the drawings in yesterday evening after work.
**Gducharme**: I sent him out like a 7pm and I've been on with you guys for an hour now.
**Gducharme**: So as soon as we get done here, I gotta follow back up with Merit and we will finalize the contract, get their pricing updated.
**Gducharme**: Their pricing should go down significantly.
**Gducharme**: Get with ag peers, do a deduct change order for them.
**Gducharme**: They're going to be mobilizing on Friday.
**Gducharme**: They're going to return, return me some update shop drawings for all the ag peers now that we've taken so many out and it's about it.
**Gducharme**: So yeah, Merit can get started now.
**Gducharme**: Now that they have updated cads and foundation plans, they can get started doing there.
**Gducharme**: But I mean it's, you know, even once they get rebar, it's going to take 10, 10 to 2, 10 days, 2 weeks to get chop drawings back at a minimum and we'll get them approved pretty quick.
**Gducharme**: But then it's going to take two to four weeks to get rebar out there.
**Gducharme**: So we're, we're at least a month right now from getting rebar on site.
**Ctragesser**: You can have shop drawings back in less than four days on a building like this.
**Gducharme**: Glenn, I understand it depend.
**Gducharme**: It depends on who I, I'm not in charge of who they use for.
**Gducharme**: I mean they know what the schedule is, they know we need to get going.
**Gducharme**: But I don't have control.
**Gducharme**: None of us have control over their who they have the shop drawing, their stu at the rebar supplier.
**Gducharme**: I don't know who they're going to use, but this is a small building so I don't expect them to break it out in phases.
**Gducharme**: No, but I mean even, you know the last company I was working with, Circle City Rebar, those guys were just, I mean it was two weeks per phase.
**Gducharme**: We made it in four phases.
**Gducharme**: It took forever.
**Gducharme**: So with the metal building was originally on for 6, 9.
**Gducharme**: So that pushed out a week or so.
**Gducharme**: We're gonna lose a week, maybe two weeks.
**Gducharme**: But I mean, you know they're gonna get out there, they're gonna dig those foundations and do one, one big pour monolithic pore.
**Gducharme**: So getting out of there by second week of June is still not out of the question, I don't think.
**Gducharme**: Do you Chad.
**Ctragesser**: When they, if they start the first week of June.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, they're I.D.
**Gducharme**: so they were on for 519, which is.
**Ctragesser**: That's.
**Gducharme**: So if they were to start, like, yeah.
**Gducharme**: Two and a half weeks from now.
**Gducharme**: So if they were to start two more weeks out on the 2nd of June, that would give them two weeks.
**Gducharme**: And then that takes to the 16th.
**Ctragesser**: That takes you to the 16th.
**Ctragesser**: With no cure time, though.
**Ctragesser**: That's why Jesse and I had it built up where we were at least giving them seven days of cure time before we started setting steel.
**Ctragesser**: Wasn't it, Jesse?
**Ctragesser**: Wasn't that our thinking?
**Speaker 2**: Sorry, for what?
**Ctragesser**: After the foundations, you and I had built in at least a minimum of seven days for cure time for the concrete before they start setting steel on it.
**Ctragesser**: Weren't we.
**Ctragesser**: Well, I know we discussed that at one time.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Ctragesser**: Now if they push out, if concrete pushes out till June 2nd and they get done the 13th, and you know, I mean, that would work with steel starting the 23rd, because then you'd have the week of the 16th as your cure time.
**Speaker 2**: Well, if you haven't phased your foundations yet, you just need to phase it with how they're going to start erecting the building.
**Speaker 2**: Or are they doing the entire perimeter first?
**Speaker 2**: Are they going to come in and do one side and work in a direction?
**Gducharme**: I mean, they're pouring the concrete monolithically.
**Gducharme**: So it's the same age regardless of where they start in the middle.
**Speaker 2**: No, but they're not going to pour all of those footings in one day.
**Speaker 2**: I'm just saying, like, because they're probably open up, you know, bisection, open it, reinforce it, pour it.
**Speaker 2**: I mean, have they given you any schedule?
**Gducharme**: That schedule, Chad, am I.
**Gducharme**: Am I wrong with.
**Gducharme**: With their intention of digging it all out, setting all the rebar and coming in and doing one pour in one day?
**Ctragesser**: No, but I wouldn't do that.
**Ctragesser**: You do that and then it rains.
**Ctragesser**: Now you're mucking your footers out and you're pulling rebar back out of it.
**Speaker 2**: No, you did you do what you can do in a day and prep it for it.
**Ctragesser**: Yep.
**Ctragesser**: Get your inspection at 1:32 o'clock.
**Gducharme**: So they were just talking about pouring those grade beams monolithically so that we didn't have to do the piers, the grade beams.
**Ctragesser**: They're talking about poor monolithically with the slab.
**Gducharme**: Right.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: All right.
**Gducharme**: That's where I was confused, I guess.
**Ctragesser**: So I need to find out which direction Nick wants to build this building in, Jesse.
**Ctragesser**: Or which direction Merit's going to want to do their foundations.
**Gducharme**: Which is all the steals there.
**Gducharme**: All the steel is Coming at once.
**Gducharme**: Obviously not in one truck, but it's all going to be delivered at once.
**Gducharme**: So we.
**Gducharme**: It doesn't matter to them where they start.
**Gducharme**: Honestly, probably easy best for them to start at the volleyball course.
**Gducharme**: We can get masonry in there and get that.
**Gducharme**: Get that going.
**Gducharme**: They're just on.
**Gducharme**: The weather's on the east wall.
**Gducharme**: Never mind.
**Gducharme**: I keep forgetting that they don't wrap that whole wall.
**Gducharme**: I don't care where they start.
**Gducharme**: They have to have the mezzanine detailing towards the end.
**Gducharme**: So they started east to west.
**Gducharme**: They're just stay and keep working on the mezzanine when they were done and would be able to gauge when the stairs are coming in a little bit better.
**Speaker 2**: Okay.
**Ctragesser**: So Jesse, which would you think is the driving factor?
**Ctragesser**: The steel or the concrete?
**Gducharme**: Which is the one?
**Ctragesser**: Which would you think is the driving factor?
**Ctragesser**: How LeMasters wants to put the building up or how Merit wants to pour the footings?
**Ctragesser**: Because like you said, you know, I.
**Speaker 2**: Would just talk to them both and see what is their reaction sequence and what is his poor schedule going to look like.
**Speaker 2**: Because you're going to need to set up all your testing for that anyways, so.
**Speaker 2**: And know how many times you need them out there for cylinders.
**Ctragesser**: Okay, I'll reach out to the master and.
**Ctragesser**: Or the neck into Kagan over there.
**Gducharme**: We should just set up a team's coordination.
**Gducharme**: Sub coordination with them at least those two.
**Gducharme**: I don't think we need anybody else involved with that right now.
**Gducharme**: But get them introduced since they need to coordinate.
**Gducharme**: It's in their contract to coordinate with each other anyway, so.
**Gducharme**: With others.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Gducharme**: Now that.
**Gducharme**: Now that we're in motion here, we're gonna.
**Gducharme**: We need to start having our sub meetings anyways.
**Gducharme**: Sub coordination meetings.
**Ctragesser**: I was sending out the invite and this meeting started, so just finishing adding everybody to it.
**Gducharme**: To what?
**Gducharme**: A sub coordination meeting?
**Ctragesser**: Yes.
**Gducharme**: Is that the one that we talked about doing on Tuesday mornings?
**Ctragesser**: Yes, at nine.
**Gducharme**: What time?
**Ctragesser**: Nine.
**Gducharme**: Nine.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: Yes.
**Gducharme**: People on site can come in to the trailer.
**Gducharme**: People can teams in.
**Gducharme**: Are you including every.
**Gducharme**: Like all of our subs are just the ones that are coming up here soon.
**Ctragesser**: I'll add everybody that's coming up within the next month.
**Ctragesser**: And then as we get further in, I'll just keep adding.
**Gducharme**: So we could take some of the stuff out.
**Gducharme**: I mean, I guess it doesn't really matter.
**Gducharme**: It's past the date.
**Gducharme**: Like removing.
**Gducharme**: Remove the volleyball court.
**Gducharme**: We didn't end up needing to do that.
**Gducharme**: If I.
**Gducharme**: So Jesse, say if I deleted this with that and it's tied to 39 as a predecessor.
**Gducharme**: Clearing grub site does that.
**Gducharme**: I haven't.
**Gducharme**: I haven't.
**Gducharme**: I haven't played around with this.
**Gducharme**: I think the Goodwill schedule would be a good one.
**Gducharme**: It's a.
**Gducharme**: It's a nice, easy one for me to learn how to put.
**Gducharme**: How to put this together and how it all coordinates and clicks here in project.
**Gducharme**: That's something we can do in it when it's.
**Gducharme**: When we're ready to do that, Jesse.
**Speaker 2**: Just do what now?
**Gducharme**: When.
**Gducharme**: When the Goodwill Foundations project ready to build the schedule.
**Gducharme**: You think you can do that?
**Gducharme**: You think you can do that?
**Gducharme**: Do that one with me?
**Gducharme**: That one's a pretty short, easy one where I can get the process down and figure out how these.
**Gducharme**: How this all pulls and it connects.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Gducharme**: Rather than messing with this one.
**Gducharme**: Chad's got this one down at this point.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, no, we can do that for sure.
**Gducharme**: All right.
**Gducharme**: So, yeah, I need to get.
**Gducharme**: Get merit going pretty much.
**Gducharme**: The site guys are going to have free run of the site for the next month.
**Ctragesser**: Hoping they're out of here by then.
**Gducharme**: At that point, they should be out of there by then.
**Gducharme**: We still need to get that testing for the parking lot.
**Gducharme**: It can't freaking dry out enough for us to do that.
**Ctragesser**: I think next week looks decent.
**Gducharme**: So with all the water we've had out there, are they.
**Gducharme**: Are they trying to get it to the.
**Gducharme**: I mean, same thing with the pad.
**Gducharme**: Are we looking at having to till up or lime stabilize the parking lot?
**Ctragesser**: That's going to be what Alig tells us, but I'm gonna guess.
**Ctragesser**: I mean, I'm hoping not.
**Ctragesser**: That's.
**Ctragesser**: You know, everything in my gut says I hope we don't.
**Gducharme**: I mean, I don't know how we're not going to at this point unless we till it up and.
**Gducharme**: I mean, give it weeks.
**Gducharme**: We've been getting hit with rain.
**Ctragesser**: Yeah.
**Ctragesser**: We got another two tents last night.
**Ctragesser**: Well, this morning, I guess.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Gducharme**: So, Jesse, Ryan, the United's pushing us to get the.
**Gducharme**: Get the parking lot area, you know, proctored and tested and proof rolled and stuff.
**Gducharme**: And it's just a mud pit out there right now.
**Gducharme**: They want to get going on the parking lot.
**Gducharme**: And.
**Speaker 2**: Is.
**Speaker 2**: What's the weather forecast for the next week?
**Gducharme**: Rain through Sunday or Monday.
**Ctragesser**: Tomorrow is clear.
**Gducharme**: Oh, cleared up tomorrow.
**Gducharme**: Nice.
**Ctragesser**: Yep, tomorrow's good.
**Ctragesser**: Saturday, a slight chance of rain.
**Ctragesser**: Sunday, a light little bit more.
**Ctragesser**: Monday.
**Ctragesser**: I mean, we're talking like 10 to 20%.
**Ctragesser**: Then next week looks pretty good.
**Gducharme**: I got 90% Saturday.
**Gducharme**: Sunday, 60 on Monday got today, tomorrow 1645, Wednesday 55.
**Gducharme**: But these forecasts don't really matter because.
**Ctragesser**: Are you looking at the percent of rain or are you looking at the temperatures?
**Gducharme**: Percent of rain to me was the temperatures.
**Gducharme**: No.
**Gducharme**: Today 60%.
**Gducharme**: Tomorrow 45.
**Gducharme**: Saturday 90.
**Gducharme**: Sunday 85.
**Gducharme**: Monday 60, Wednesday 55%.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Ctragesser**: The 10 day weather on the weather channel is totally different.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, I'm sure it is.
**Gducharme**: Have you guys used that, seen that weather app that like talks.
**Gducharme**: Today's gonna be gloomy, rainy, stay in bed.
**Ctragesser**: Okay.
**Speaker 2**: So when is like on your schedule?
**Speaker 2**: They were supposed to be doing a parking lot right now but I thought they had to get all their utilities in across it.
**Speaker 2**: Is that done or water the fire?
**Ctragesser**: The water is a week out minimum their bore and then after that it'll only take him about three days.
**Ctragesser**: He said to get to the building pad because they're boring from the T in the middle of the parking lot out to the connection at the road sanitary.
**Ctragesser**: Once we have an answer on that he said they should be able to get that done in three to four days.
**Ctragesser**: And they're wrapping up storm.
**Ctragesser**: I mean they're already over at 609 going to 6:10 and then they just have to come back and catch 611 and bring it back to the 606 and then storm.
**Ctragesser**: The majority of all storm will be done that's on the parking lot in that area.
**Speaker 2**: So like getting all their utilities in then they can build their parking lot.
**Speaker 2**: So correct like when is that date that they're done with all utilities.
**Speaker 2**: The fire, you could even rough in all the electrical so they're not tearing through everything doing that after the water.
**Ctragesser**: And the should be at the absolute latest 5:23 if not earlier.
**Speaker 2**: Okay, well I would wait till then then you hopefully things will dry out then you can build your parking.
**Gducharme**: Is this our permit?
**Gducharme**: This is application and I haven't paid for the water permit yet.
**Gducharme**: It's got a permit number.
**Gducharme**: It says water service permit right on came to me.
**Gducharme**: Water service application is what it's titled to the applicant issuing the permit.
**Gducharme**: Do you see this, Jesse?
**Gducharme**: Chad, what is it?
**Gducharme**: I'm asking is this our water permit?
**Gducharme**: Ashton just forwarded it to me.
**Gducharme**: Everything from citizens goes to Ashton, Katie and Ryan doesn't go to us at all.
**Ctragesser**: I would say it is this date issued 51 of 25.
**Ctragesser**: That's right now.
**Gducharme**: Today.
**Gducharme**: Right now.
**Gducharme**: I haven't paid for it.
**Ctragesser**: Permit, permit number.
**Gducharme**: He labeled it application but get this printed out and put on site.
**Gducharme**: Right Chad?
**Ctragesser**: Yeah.
**Gducharme**: We obviously don't have our building permit.
**Gducharme**: I asked if there was a, like a public works permit that we needed to have posted.
**Gducharme**: Never got an answer from anybody on that from.
**Gducharme**: From the city.
**Gducharme**: It was just like the IDEM and swift stuff and IDEM has never sent Ashton the permit.
**Gducharme**: He said they just do it on their own time.
**Gducharme**: We send it to him, we send it to them that after 48 hours we can go ahead and get started.
**Gducharme**: Okay, so obviously that was done months ago, but.
**Ctragesser**: Well, we're definitely started.
**Gducharme**: All right, I just printed this out, so I'll bring it up to the site.
**Gducharme**: We got Internet on site now.
**Ctragesser**: Yes.
**Gducharme**: Bathrooms.
**Gducharme**: Is your trailer in the way now of where they're gonna, where that sanitary line continues to run?
**Ctragesser**: Nope.
**Gducharme**: So we don't need to really move that thing until.
**Ctragesser**: They'Re done with all.
**Gducharme**: Their underground and get ready for parking lot.
**Gducharme**: Okay, cool.
**Gducharme**: Got a new schedule.
**Gducharme**: Luckily nothing much.
**Gducharme**: Nothing much pushed down the line though, Right when you build schedule and not.
**Ctragesser**: Enough, not enough to worry about.
**Ctragesser**: As long as we get through the next couple weeks with no major delays on either drawings or weather, we should be able to stay with the schedule or even maybe make up some time with it.
**Gducharme**: Well, I mean another thing too that we're not considering is our ILP we don't have which now that these are ready to go, they can go to state for cdr, but I need those to go to, to go to ILP within the platting needs to be finished and the update that I have is Ashton and the attorneys are working on it, so I'm going to follow back up with them.
**Gducharme**: But do we need to have the ILP building permit before we get foundations or is it just before we go vertical?
**Ctragesser**: No, you have to have, you have to have your building permit before we do foundations.
**Ctragesser**: You have to call for foundation inspections.
**Gducharme**: That's not did like a foundations underground package or thing before.
**Gducharme**: Then we did a shell and core permit and then the final permit just to phase it, foundations first and then.
**Ctragesser**: You'Ll do your under slab, all your plumbing and everything and then.
**Ctragesser**: Yeah, then you'll start going vertical and then you just get into your, you know, standard permits of, you know, rough in so forth for each fate for each trade.
**Gducharme**: Yep.
**Gducharme**: All right, let me get this meeting agenda together for a design meeting.
**Gducharme**: I think we're about wrapped up with these design meetings, Jesse.
**Gducharme**: Right?
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, I think so today probably the.
**Gducharme**: Last one at least.
**Gducharme**: I don't know if everybody's even going to be on here and needed to be on here at this point.
**Gducharme**: Probably Just Nick and Jeff or in the MEP Guys.
**Gducharme**: Ashton can probably go away.
**Gducharme**: Jerrica could probably go away from here.
**Gducharme**: Okay, so what do you think of this?
**Gducharme**: This week or next week?
**Gducharme**: Our last design meeting.
**Speaker 2**: Well, where's your interior design at exactly?
**Gducharme**: Yeah, I don't.
**Gducharme**: I don't know, because Eli sent an estimate over to Brandon.
**Gducharme**: I don't know.
**Gducharme**: I don't know what.
**Gducharme**: What Their design.
**Gducharme**: What.
**Gducharme**: They've decided about switching interior design away from access to.
**Gducharme**: To Eli with.
**Speaker 3**: With.
**Gducharme**: Damn good.
**Gducharme**: Who did the Liberty location?
**Speaker 2**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: So I don't know what that's going to do to any.
**Gducharme**: Any of what we have going on so far.
**Gducharme**: The renderings that we keep getting are.
**Gducharme**: I mean, we got new ones, but it's like, of the bathrooms and.
**Gducharme**: And the bars and stuff kind of different than the renderings that we had before, but they still look, you know, they look the same type of rendering.
**Gducharme**: They still look the same.
**Speaker 2**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: But.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Gducharme**: Well, are you on.
**Gducharme**: Are you going to be on this meeting at 10?
**Speaker 2**: Yep.
**Gducharme**: Okay, we'll see you there then.
**Speaker 2**: All right, see you.
**Ctragesser**: All right, thanks, guys.
