## Transcript
**Gtjones**: Morning, Tim.
**Gtjones**: Morning.
**Gtjones**: See, Jesse is on the phone right now.
**Gtjones**: He's going to join us shortly.
**Gtjones**: So I'm rewording the two that I had and then I'm taking the panel out of change order one, the new panel.
**Gtjones**: So it'll be just breakers.
**Gtjones**: And then on change order two, I'm leaving the panel in there with three 200amp breakers.
**Gtjones**: And that should be about it.
**Gtjones**: It's pretty, pretty cut and dry now.
**Gtjones**: Okay, so the, the breakers that you're living on, that's what is going to work with the upgraded or offsized transformers, correct, the 200amp breakers.
**Gtjones**: Yep.
**Gtjones**: Okay, does that change the feeders at all?
**Gtjones**: Well, I've got in there.
**Gtjones**: Yes, it does change the feeders.
**Gtjones**: I've got the install new feeders to the transformer.
**Gtjones**: 1200ft of feeders for the new transformer.
**Gtjones**: So they have to change too, because the 75s are not enough to drive them to or them 112s.
**Gtjones**: A 75 KVA transformer is only 125amp feeder.
**Gtjones**: But then the 112s are 200amp feeders.
**Gtjones**: So yeah, it has to be upgraded plus a voltage drop.
**Gtjones**: So that's the only thing on two of them.
**Gtjones**: I did put the feeders in there on both of them.
**Gtjones**: 125amp feeder with three 125amp breakers and a 200amp feeder with three 200amp breakers and then new gear to support when you get up past 200, around 200, it's easier just to order a panel and the breakers instead of trying to get the breakers.
**Gtjones**: So.
**Gtjones**: And they kind of called out.
**Gtjones**: They wanted some more space in the panel anyway.
**Gtjones**: Gotcha.
**Gtjones**: Okay.
**Gtjones**: Yep.
**Gtjones**: That's why I looked at right there.
**Gtjones**: You got it.
**Gtjones**: I got that up too.
**Gtjones**: And see, and I don't know that he's got that changed on what size there accommodate those new transformers.
**Gtjones**: This 4 odd is not even going to come close.
**Gtjones**: And he's got copper also.
**Gtjones**: So I mean four ought copper.
**Gtjones**: So aluminum, not copper.
**Gtjones**: Yep.
**Gtjones**: Correct.
**Gtjones**: Yes, sir.
**Gtjones**: The whole job's aluminum.
**Gtjones**: Yeah, you can change all those cus to aluminum.
**Gtjones**: Als just do the whole column.
**Gtjones**: Oh, okay.
**Gtjones**: See, I hope you're better than me at Excel.
**Gtjones**: I'm kind of half.
**Gtjones**: Half.
**Gtjones**: How was your weekend?
**Gtjones**: Weekend was relaxing.
**Gtjones**: It was almost relaxing.
**Gtjones**: I was babysitting.
**Gtjones**: Well, that's kind of relaxing spending time with grandkids.
**Gtjones**: But yeah, we took our grandkids out with us to the farm and that was high energy.
**Gtjones**: And I'm old and every time I play with the Grandkids.
**Gtjones**: I have bruises.
**Gtjones**: They're rough.
**Gtjones**: I'm just old, I guess it's.
**Gtjones**: It is rough dealing with kids.
**Gtjones**: I have a.
**Gtjones**: Nine months old.
**Gtjones**: Yep.
**Gtjones**: You're.
**Gtjones**: You're just starting the fun.
**Gtjones**: Yeah.
**Gtjones**: And my daughter's 31 and has two kids and all the bills, house, dogs, cars, all the traditional stuff.
**Gtjones**: Yeah.
**Gtjones**: So I got grandkids.
**Gtjones**: Now we're an empty nester for a while, so we've been without her for probably seven years now, so.
**Gtjones**: Oh, nice.
**Gtjones**: Yeah, my wife's grandma passed away Friday, so I gotta deal with that this week.
**Gtjones**: You say your wife's grandmother?
**Gtjones**: Yes.
**Gtjones**: 93.
**Gtjones**: Oh, wow.
**Gtjones**: I know.
**Gtjones**: Which is good because I didn't think I'd ever make it past 50.
**Gtjones**: So I had a rough childhood.
**Gtjones**: You know, I was in trouble most of my life.
**Gtjones**: I like fire.
**Gtjones**: I like to burn stuff down for some reason.
**Gtjones**: I don't know why.
**Gtjones**: Caught the cornfield on fire a little bit.
**Gtjones**: Everything.
**Gtjones**: Yeah, we were playing with bottle rockets and they went and caught the corn stalks on fire.
**Gtjones**: And just so you know, a garden hose won't put those out either.
**Gtjones**: Need something a little bit bigger, like a fire truck.
**Gtjones**: Found it out the hard way, though.
**Gtjones**: Oh, my God.
**Jdawson**: Is it.
**Gtjones**: Well, it was.
**Gtjones**: Was it just for fun?
**Gtjones**: Yeah, we were just goofing off with kids and building model rockets.
**Gtjones**: You know those rockets you can make and they shoot up in the air?
**Gtjones**: Well, we decided to do some other stuff with them and they didn't go up in the air, they just kind of went straight and then they got caught in the cornstalks and caught him on fire.
**Gtjones**: It didn't take about a minute.
**Gtjones**: That happens quicker than you think.
**Gtjones**: Was this.
**Gtjones**: Was this in Indiana?
**Gtjones**: Yeah, yeah.
**Gtjones**: This is probably.
**Gtjones**: This is probably 35 years ago.
**Gtjones**: 30.
**Gtjones**: 35.
**Gtjones**: Yeah, 35 years ago.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Gtjones**: Probably longer than that.
**Gtjones**: Now I'm thinking about it.
**Gtjones**: Man, I'm getting old.
**Gtjones**: My uncle was in the Marine Corps and he brought home this book of survival.
**Gtjones**: How to survive and make booby traps and stuff.
**Gtjones**: So we started doing a lot of the stuff in the book and we got in trouble for about everyone.
**Gtjones**: We made up too.
**Gtjones**: Every booby trap was a bad plan.
**Gtjones**: Something got burned up or hurt.
**Gtjones**: Half the time it was me that got hurt.
**Gtjones**: Locked my eyebrows a couple times.
**Gtjones**: A little flame and it's quick, buddy.
**Gtjones**: Reaching to see if you got hair left.
**Gtjones**: Oh, my God.
**Gtjones**: But yeah, I mean, we didn't have all the video games and everything else, so we went allowed in the house during the summer.
**Gtjones**: So we had to make make ourselves useful and tear stuff up.
**Gtjones**: Useful, exactly.
**Gtjones**: Go to the junkyard and get old bicycles and cut the forks off and put them on our new bicycles.
**Gtjones**: And have choppers, all kinds of cool stuff.
**Gtjones**: Put the decks of cards in the spokes so it made that noise.
**Gtjones**: Yeah, just stupid stuff.
**Gtjones**: Of course I shot my sister with the BB gun.
**Gtjones**: I think three or four times.
**Gtjones**: I convinced her to hold the target.
**Gtjones**: Which that never worked.
**Gtjones**: Well, I can't believe she did it.
**Gtjones**: So I shot her.
**Gtjones**: But I mean, it was one of them.
**Gtjones**: The old Daisy BB guns didn't hurt anyway.
**Gtjones**: But of course she made a big deal out of it.
**Gtjones**: I was a mean house.
**Gtjones**: What dad said, you're a mean ass.
**Gtjones**: What do you expect, dude?
**Gtjones**: I gotta entertain myself here, right?
**Gtjones**: Did you want.
**Gtjones**: He said you want some entertaining?
**Gtjones**: Go out and get the ax and work on that wood pile like.
**Gtjones**: All right.
**Gtjones**: Let me see if Jesse is available to join us.
**Jdawson**: Good morning, Tim.
**Gtjones**: Hi, sir.
**Gtjones**: How are you?
**Jdawson**: Good.
**Jdawson**: So one of the questions.
**Jdawson**: I don't know if we're looking at the same screen.
**Gtjones**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Like those two sets of two odd.
**Jdawson**: Are they big enough?
**Jdawson**: And then we're just doing the one set of one ought those two runs.
**Gtjones**: No, I mean if you look down at the bottom, then 500kW are them three transformers, some of them short.
**Gtjones**: And they'll work with the voltage calculations.
**Gtjones**: But the.
**Gtjones**: There's the T7.
**Gtjones**: And what numbers are they?
**Gtjones**: T10 and T7.
**Gtjones**: They're pretty good feeders.
**Gtjones**: So they have to have multi drop.
**Gtjones**: So the wire size goes up plus on that.
**Gtjones**: Jesse is on aluminum.
**Gtjones**: You're automatically up a size.
**Gtjones**: So when you go from copper to aluminum, the wire size is automatically up 1.
**Gtjones**: So for a 200amp service is 4.
**Gtjones**: 4 aluminum.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Gtjones**: To just regular run.
**Gtjones**: And then once you get out past 150ft, it starts going up.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So that wire.
**Jdawson**: We just need the linear foot that you have to provide and then the cost for that wire that needs changed out.
**Gtjones**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: What else was on the list?
**Gtjones**: Is that what you're talking about?
**Gtjones**: So change order one.
**Gtjones**: I've got on the list so far as credit for the transformers.
**Gtjones**: Add 325amp breakers.
**Gtjones**: Provide 325amp feeders 1200ft long.
**Gtjones**: That's it for change order one.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Gtjones**: And then change order two is install 312 KVA transformers with new 200amp breakers in main gear.
**Gtjones**: And new main gear because they said they want some extra space in the gear.
**Gtjones**: Plus when you go to get the 200amp breakers, it's faster to get new gear than it is to try to order loose breakers.
**Jdawson**: Hold on.
**Jdawson**: When did.
**Jdawson**: When did this happen?
**Jdawson**: We're actually changing the main switch gear.
**Gtjones**: I mean we.
**Gtjones**: I'm fine with it if you don't want to.
**Gtjones**: It's just going to take a little bit more time to get the breakers.
**Jdawson**: Well, I mean there's where like was that cost in the original change order?
**Gtjones**: Yeah, the first ones we sent.
**Gtjones**: Yeah.
**Gtjones**: On change order two.
**Gtjones**: Also that.
**Jdawson**: Because it doesn't mention anything about changing out the main switch gear.
**Gtjones**: Okay.
**Gtjones**: I mean I can take that out.
**Jdawson**: Well, what is the time difference?
**Jdawson**: If we just do the breakers, it's.
**Gtjones**: Probably going to be four to six weeks and the other is eight to 12.
**Jdawson**: So the gear can be switched in four to six and the brake.
**Gtjones**: No, no, no, no.
**Gtjones**: Just the opposite.
**Gtjones**: The gear is going to be 8 to 12 and the breakers is going to be 4 to 6.
**Jdawson**: So we're just going to switch the breakers.
**Jdawson**: Definitely.
**Gtjones**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So we just.
**Jdawson**: We just need this because they're wanting a lot of detail and I want us to be able to provide exactly what we're doing here.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Gtjones**: Yeah.
**Gtjones**: So I mean it's pretty clear.
**Gtjones**: So install three 12, 112 KVA transformers with three new 200amp breakers and then install 1200ft of 200amp feeder for new transformers.
**Gtjones**: That's it.
**Gtjones**: That's pretty straightforward.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Gtjones**: You good with that?
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: And is there any way you can break down those different scopes?
**Jdawson**: Like are the Breakers 500 bucks a piece?
**Jdawson**: Are they a thousand dollars a piece of.
**Gtjones**: I'll see what I can get the company the square D to do.
**Gtjones**: I mean they're pretty picky about when you ask them for unit prices.
**Gtjones**: I mean.
**Jdawson**: But that's.
**Jdawson**: That's fine.
**Jdawson**: But I mean you can say three breakers is this much money.
**Jdawson**: Wire is this much and the three transformers are this much.
**Jdawson**: We can do the math.
**Jdawson**: It's just a like a full price for like here's our scopes here and these are the full prices for them.
**Jdawson**: And then we should be good.
**Gtjones**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: I don't need it exact.
**Jdawson**: I just need ballparks for all of it.
**Jdawson**: That makes up your change order because you know it's also throwing on these little extras like and I.
**Jdawson**: It's probably automatic where it's like forklift and you know, all those things.
**Jdawson**: I'm sure that's just part of your every change order.
**Jdawson**: Kicks that on.
**Gtjones**: No, I usually add it based on what we're doing.
**Gtjones**: So I mean on the service work Orders we do have some miscellaneous stuff for you know, tires and gas and all that.
**Gtjones**: But rental I have to add was a rental because here it's a little bit more.
**Gtjones**: Because they're 40 foot ceilings.
**Gtjones**: So I just basically look at the hours and ceiling heights and then if I'm going to need a lift for two weeks or a month and then two months so then I have to change the price and calculate the dollar.
**Jdawson**: So this is simply because we always had to put wires in or this is for the additional length of wire or like is that where this comes from?
**Gtjones**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: And do we have like if you could also tell us quick.
**Jdawson**: Hopefully you have it this, it's 1100 linear feet.
**Jdawson**: Now what was it originally?
**Jdawson**: Was it 800 linear feet or do you know that info information?
**Gtjones**: Yeah, I'd have to, I'd have to go through both sets of prints because they change locations of the transformer knowing to make sure we're still using the same feet.
**Gtjones**: That's the problem is every time I seem like I get a sheep it has different information on.
**Gtjones**: So I mean for instance that.
**Gtjones**: And that's where it was very confusing with the air compressor because I had two air compressor circuits but then they put a pneumatic in there.
**Gtjones**: Didn't say anything about an air compressor.
**Gtjones**: To, to me pneumatic lines is just the plastic tubing for you know, equipment air compressor, black pipe.
**Gtjones**: So I'm like dude, I don't have pneumatic.
**Gtjones**: What's, what's the size of that then?
**Gtjones**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay, well good deal.
**Jdawson**: If you can just give us those things for each either option one or option two and just break it apart by.
**Jdawson**: Because one is just going to be the wire change.
**Gtjones**: Yeah.
**Gtjones**: So I can break the wire out, the transformers out and the breakers out.
**Gtjones**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: And one thing I asked them Tim when we emailed them, you know, if their idea is they're going to have.
**Jdawson**: We're going to hardwire just direct wire 480 volts into their equipment and then they're going to somehow transform this power.
**Jdawson**: Does that not all.
**Jdawson**: Like if they put a transformer in their equipment, does that not also bump up the requirements of the wire?
**Gtjones**: We look at just the primary side on ours.
**Gtjones**: So if they run that 125amp feeder into wood, their transformer, the, the, the main feeder is smaller.
**Gtjones**: The secondary is going to be the 100 and it pops up the voltage.
**Gtjones**: Does that make sense?
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Gtjones**: To 40 to 400 volts also.
**Gtjones**: So like if you've got a 75 KVA transformer it's 125amps on the primary side, and secondary side is 250.
**Gtjones**: I've got a cheat sheet.
**Gtjones**: That's why.
**Gtjones**: And then on a 112, it's 200amps and 400amps.
**Gtjones**: So 200 in, 400 out.
**Jdawson**: Okay, but then why does.
**Jdawson**: But so it's just the fact of the one.
**Jdawson**: The 112.5amp, they just require more than 75s we were putting in before.
**Gtjones**: So a 75 is on in copper, it's three number ones with a number six ground, and then it's three.
**Gtjones**: Three odds with a number six ground for the 112.
**Gtjones**: But then you got to convert those to aluminum.
**Gtjones**: So that's where the.
**Gtjones**: That's where the bump in the wires comes up to the wire size.
**Jdawson**: But it's still cheaper than copper.
**Gtjones**: Yes, absolutely.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay, well, good deal.
**Jdawson**: If you get that over to Keba, we can get that to them, and then hopefully they'll make a decision and we'll go one direction.
**Gtjones**: I mean, as of.
**Gtjones**: Well, today I'm going to go out and get the semi headed that way for delivery for the seventh for the gear and the wire.
**Gtjones**: So we can start pulling that 1200amp feeder and then maybe some of the secondary feeders to the transformers, too.
**Gtjones**: So, you know, sooner the better.
**Gtjones**: Plus, I still got to order those transformers.
**Jdawson**: So is all that coming up next.
**Gtjones**: Week on the 7th?
**Gtjones**: Yeah, whatever I can get on the semi.
**Gtjones**: I think I got 21 pallets, but I don't think I can get all of it on the same line.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, Mike will be back Monday, so.
**Gtjones**: Yeah, that's like.
**Gtjones**: I coordinate with Mike.
**Gtjones**: So he could be back to unloaded on seventh.
**Gtjones**: Yeah.
**Gtjones**: So we're good.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Gtjones**: Anything else?
**Jdawson**: Thanks.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: We'll see you.
