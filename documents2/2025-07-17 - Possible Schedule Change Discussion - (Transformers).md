## Transcript
**Mparsons**: Sam.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Hey, Joe, how's it going?
**Mparsons**: Hello, can you hear me?
**Joseph.burdzy**: Yes.
**Cody.page**: Okay, perfect.
**Mparsons**: We're sorry.
**Mparsons**: We're good.
**Mparsons**: We got.
**Mparsons**: I got the team in the meeting room, so I just want to make sure that everybody's here.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Yeah, I think I did invite Jesse but he's on a different meeting right now.
**Joseph.burdzy**: So I think we are good to go.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Good to go.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Unless if you have someone else on your team, that's that we can wait for.
**Cody.page**: Yes.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Okay.
**Joseph.burdzy**: So I did talk to our electrical electric super, at least not super, the subcontractor today.
**Joseph.burdzy**: And so again, it depends on what direction we are going, but we talked specifically about the 112 transformers.
**Joseph.burdzy**: And if we are to go with.
**Mparsons**: That.
**Joseph.burdzy**: The lead time is eight to 12 weeks.
**Joseph.burdzy**: And I think right now we are currently scheduled for connecting to those transformers in September, I believe.
**Joseph.burdzy**: So it would basically push.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Push everything to mid to late October if we were to have a disease on today.
**Joseph.burdzy**: And another thing he brought to my attention was that the transformers, the price might go up because of the price for copper has gone up lately 17%.
**Joseph.burdzy**: So it might.
**Joseph.burdzy**: It could reflect on the, the new transformer cost when we decide to purchase.
**Joseph.burdzy**: But he said as of this morning it is, it is still the same.
**Cody.page**: Okay.
**Cody.page**: Yeah.
**Mparsons**: So the 112 transformers, that's if we're going with the bigger, with the more expensive change order, right, Leon?
**Cody.page**: All right.
**Mparsons**: That's the big truth.
**Mparsons**: Okay, so what about for the other change order with the 480.
**Joseph.burdzy**: So for, for that, I mean, if we need to reorder the same transformers that, that were previously designed and purchased, but we cancel two of them, I think the lead time for that is a little less, about six to eight weeks.
**Joseph.burdzy**: So there might be a slight delay there, but that is going to be a little less than the big transformers.
**Mparsons**: What would we have to.
**Mparsons**: We don't have to order any transformers with the 6 to 8 with the.
**Mparsons**: When we're doing 480 though?
**Cody.page**: Well, yeah, the 480.
**Joseph.burdzy**: When we are connecting directly.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Yes.
**Joseph.burdzy**: I think for that we only need to order the feeders unless that's it.
**Mparsons**: Okay, and what's the lead time on feeders?
**Joseph.burdzy**: I think it's about five weeks for those.
**Cody.page**: Yeah.
**Mparsons**: But at this time, but at this time, like there's no.
**Mparsons**: We're not, they're not going to give us any kind of like personnel delay, change order or anything like that.
**Mparsons**: Right.
**Joseph.burdzy**: As of now, there's nothing.
**Joseph.burdzy**: But if it delays, if it delays too much going into November.
**Joseph.burdzy**: And they.
**Joseph.burdzy**: He said because the Way we have it scheduled is he sent his guys because they are, they're coming from Indiana.
**Joseph.burdzy**: So he sends his guys to, to, to New Jersey.
**Joseph.burdzy**: And at some point, if they have to go back and then, then have to come back in, he said there would be remobilization costs associated.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Yes.
**Mparsons**: As of right now, what was the date that you had planned for them to finish their work?
**Joseph.burdzy**: Let me see.
**Joseph.burdzy**: I think.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Okay, so we have him scheduled for September 15 for the final connection to transformers in plan B.
**Joseph.burdzy**: And for plan A, we have them scheduled for October 13th.
**Mparsons**: When you say plan B, you mean like Sky Pod B, correct?
**Cody.page**: Yeah.
**Mparsons**: Okay, so basically what I'm looking at here, and that's October.
**Mparsons**: If we get an answer by the end of the month, we shouldn't see any delay for the 480 whatsoever, is that correct?
**Joseph.burdzy**: There could be because that.
**Joseph.burdzy**: So for that we, we wouldn't have to wait for the final connection to the transformers, but since we are connecting directly to, to the panels, we might have to do that later.
**Joseph.burdzy**: So it would probably push us back.
**Jdawson**: Hey, Joe, they got.
**Jdawson**: Hey, sorry, this is Jesse.
**Jdawson**: The, you know, the, whatever route we go also determines the breaker size they get.
**Jdawson**: And the breakers take longer than like the transformers or even getting a brand new main gear.
**Jdawson**: I think they're 12 weeks, aren't they, Keva?
**Joseph.burdzy**: 10 weeks for the 10 weeks for the breaker.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Mparsons**: And we need the breakers for the 480.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, they're the main breakers that we're changing the size of.
**Jdawson**: You know, the main panel came with 75amp breakers, I think, and now we're changing them to 125s.
**Mparsons**: I thought a couple weeks ago we said that those were six weeks.
**Mparsons**: Six to eight weeks.
**Jdawson**: The transformers, I think are the eight weeks.
**Jdawson**: The breakers were the ten.
**Jdawson**: So it's ten weeks from today.
**Jdawson**: When do we want to put power on to that equipment?
**Mparsons**: Breakers of 10 weeks that already has this at September 25th for 10 weeks.
**Jdawson**: And when it, when it.
**Jdawson**: What's the date you require power on to those?
**Mparsons**: Yeah, I'm trying to find it real quick.
**Mparsons**: I just want to, I want to avoid like, like he was saying earlier, I don't want them to have to leave the site and come back if it's not in their plan to do that.
**Mparsons**: Right now.
**Mparsons**: Right now I need, I need power by end of October, by mid October.
**Mparsons**: So that if it was the 31st, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, that would put us on October 9th.
**Mparsons**: And then they'd have a week to put everything in.
**Cody.page**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: That Actually, that actually still works out.
**Mparsons**: I just want to.
**Mparsons**: I just want to make sure that we're not causing any, any change orders from the, from the electrician as far as re.
**Mparsons**: Mobilizing and leaving and stuff, like you said before.
**Joseph.burdzy**: So go ahead, Jesse.
**Jdawson**: I'm just saying, Kevin, you just need to get with deem make sure that that gets something in writing that that's not going to delay or if there is going to be a deem mode.
**Jdawson**: We just need to know if that's the case.
**Cody.page**: Okay.
**Joseph.burdzy**: And so, Joe, you guys are still looking to make a decision.
**Joseph.burdzy**: You said by the end of this month.
**Mparsons**: Now, I wanted to be, but I wanted to be by the end of next week.
**Cody.page**: But.
**Mparsons**: But let's face it, you know, it's not our decision to make, it's the customers.
**Mparsons**: And I'm trying to avoid this change order, you know, and any additional charges because honestly, it's not our fault, but it kind of isn't their fault either.
**Mparsons**: You know, as I said in the call yesterday, it's something that's never been done.
**Mparsons**: We didn't foresee this issue coming up.
**Mparsons**: So we're working with their corrugate supplier to, to get a decision if this is even a possibility to do.
**Mparsons**: And then we need Uniqlo because it's going to cost them more money in their, in the, basically the box manufacturing process.
**Mparsons**: So they need to confirm if they're going to be able to absorb this cost.
**Mparsons**: But in the meantime, we have this whole construction project going on.
**Mparsons**: And you know, I've been through this.
**Mparsons**: So.
**Mparsons**: How many times?
**Mparsons**: Dozens of times.
**Mparsons**: And yes, normally when you start changing schedules, you get hit with revobilization, change orders and things like that.
**Mparsons**: And it just, it just happens.
**Mparsons**: So I'm trying to get ahead of that and say, like Justin just said, like, get it writing that says if we get you a decision by, you know, the 31st, or let's call it two weeks.
**Cody.page**: Yeah.
**Mparsons**: Which would be the 31st by the 1st of August.
**Mparsons**: Will there not be any.
**Mparsons**: Or you let him get the date.
**Mparsons**: Say maybe if you just get it by this date, there won't be any change orders.
**Cody.page**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And two, we'll follow up and put like actual dates in writing.
**Jdawson**: Like breakers are this many weeks transformers or this many weeks based on today.
**Jdawson**: And things change all the time.
**Jdawson**: Like in a week from now, that lead time could jump to another two to four weeks, depending on what else is going on in the world.
**Jdawson**: So we just need to update that every week.
**Jdawson**: Like, here's where it is now based on, yes, today's info.
**Mparsons**: A delay in the.
**Mparsons**: Delay in the, the schedule doesn't affect me as much as, you know, let's face it, Uniblow is not going to want to.
**Mparsons**: I don't want to burden this relationship with Uniqlo.
**Mparsons**: You know, you probably already know that they fought us pretty hard over $7,000 already.
**Mparsons**: Like, yeah, they're very.
**Mparsons**: I don't want anything to be differentiated from the initial agreement, which I, I don't know how they haven't done large projects like this in the past that, you know, that they, they have to know that there has to be a contingency, that there is going to be change orders.
**Mparsons**: We're doing everything we possibly can for there not to be, but, you know, I'd rather that come later in the project than, you know, getting that kind of scuffle to start the project.
**Mparsons**: So, yeah, we're doing everything we can.
**Mparsons**: I mean, the thing is, let's, let's just get that from the electrician to say, like, hey, if you give me an answer by this, I mean, put it this way, we're, we're like 95% sure we're going with option B. I just want to make sure.
**Mparsons**: I have my team now putting together an estimated power consumption for option B and I just.
**Mparsons**: And then I'll run that by Brian in Henderson to make sure that that wouldn't change anything.
**Mparsons**: I think the 480 Volt option is going to consume is going to cover the max amount that we plan on using.
**Mparsons**: So if we go below that, I don't know if it changes at the size of any breakers or, you know, affects anything else.
**Mparsons**: So I'm just trying to get that safeguard that says, hey, if we have to pull the trigger somewhere, let's pull the trigger with making sure that we're covered for later as well.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Cody.page**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: Like I said, this didn't have to be a really long conversation.
**Mparsons**: I just wanted to cover the bases about the change.
**Mparsons**: I know you guys have your contractor that you have to deal with, so I didn't, I didn't want it to be complicated.
**Mparsons**: I didn't want to go through all this on that, on a large platform with, you know, Ahmed and Yuzuke and everybody like that too.
**Mparsons**: So I think once this construction starts, we're gonna have weekly meetings just between Alato and Uniqlo.
**Mparsons**: I'm sorry, not Uniqlo and Exotech here.
**Mparsons**: So that we can align together and, and avoid anything coming down the line.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we need to coordinate.
**Jdawson**: Have it like Wednesday morning or something.
**Cody.page**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So Wednesday afternoon.
**Cody.page**: Yeah.
**Mparsons**: So we can go into that Wednesday meeting like we're on the same page and we know what's about to happen.
**Mparsons**: Because in the end, I mean, I don't know if Brandon has filled you all in, but we pushed for Uniqlo to use you because you've done exotech projects in the past and everything like that.
**Mparsons**: So we're, we're kind of in the same boat together.
**Mparsons**: If you guys look good, we look good, you know, and that's, that's.
**Mparsons**: We want to keep it that way.
**Jdawson**: Agreed, Agreed.
**Jdawson**: And on the, like, sprinkler pipe, doing the bulk main, like if we started that next week just to get that work done and then like, you're still, like, you're planning on delivering your racks next week and you're, you're still going to start standing them on that date on our schedule.
**Mparsons**: We're not.
**Mparsons**: We wouldn't start standing until the 11th as of right now.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So we need to be out of your way by then.
**Mparsons**: Yeah, we wouldn't start standing till the 11th.
**Mparsons**: And I'm just giving you a heads up there might be a delay there.
**Mparsons**: So I don't know if you want to kind of let your sprinkler, whoever's doing your sprinkler, maybe give them a heads up that there could be a delay.
**Mparsons**: And if there is, is there any again, just like the electrician.
**Mparsons**: Is everything already planned where they have to remobilize everybody and things of that.
**Mparsons**: So what's happening right now, just.
**Mparsons**: And I don't want to alarm anybody, so don't bring it up because I'm not going to actually release this information probably until Monday to the entire team.
**Mparsons**: But our floor markings is done by these robots.
**Mparsons**: It's in Portland right now at another site.
**Mparsons**: And what happened is one of the robots was damaged when they shipped it out there.
**Mparsons**: And without three robots going, or I think it's three or four without all robots going, it slows them down in more than just like losing 25%.
**Mparsons**: So without the floor markings, we can't stand up, we can't drill holes and we can't do the stand up.
**Mparsons**: So they're trying right now to see if we can get another machine out there so that they can finish in time.
**Mparsons**: But if they cannot, it does delay.
**Cody.page**: It's.
**Mparsons**: We're going to keep the deliveries coming on schedule, but it does delay the start of erecting.
**Jdawson**: And that delay is a week, maybe.
**Mparsons**: It'S unknown Right now.
**Mparsons**: So that's why I'm kind of just giving you a heads up.
**Mparsons**: We're trying to get more information and I'll have like a final.
**Mparsons**: I'll have final dates for Monday to let everybody know.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Joseph.burdzy**: All right, Joe, I'm going to send you the current schedule that we have if you want to mark up, because I think we have you guys starting on the 4th, but you're saying the 11th, if you want to maybe mark up so I can update on the schedule.
**Mparsons**: The fourth is when everybody was going to be mobilized, and actually that's when originally the shipments were supposed to start.
**Mparsons**: So construction technically starts the 4th, but they wouldn't actually do any upgrades until the 11th.
**Mparsons**: It'd probably be a week of organizing and, you know, getting them and they have to do some.
**Mparsons**: Some pre assembly before they can start up staining the uprights.
**Mparsons**: So the earliest that you would be putting in.
**Mparsons**: Yeah, the earliest you'd be putting in any sprinklers would be the 11th interacting.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Gotcha.
**Mparsons**: But again, tomorrow, I'll have the team on the call or everybody on the.
**Mparsons**: On that call.
**Mparsons**: I invited quite a lot of people, which will include the site managers, so they have a lot more insight.
**Mparsons**: If you guys.
**Mparsons**: I want this to be not only a call about kind of some design questions, but I wanted to also get out of the way any, any questions that you all might have as far as how many, you know, how long until you can start putting them in, what's or strategy on putting them in, or how many days.
**Mparsons**: Like I said, we don't start erecting until the 11th.
**Mparsons**: Well, there has to be so many stood up before the area is actually safe for somebody to come in behind and start putting in piping.
**Mparsons**: So I want to make sure that we're all aligned on when it can actually start happening, if that makes sense.
**Speaker 4**: Yeah.
**Mparsons**: So the team will definitely be working Monday through Saturday.
**Mparsons**: Do you have your sprinkler schedule for that?
**Joseph.burdzy**: I think our team is Monday through Friday.
**Speaker 4**: Yes.
**Mparsons**: And just.
**Speaker 4**: And just so we know, the sprinkler team, they are, they are local.
**Speaker 4**: So, you know, as long as we're communicating with them the plan, there shouldn't be any major demobilization fees or anything.
**Mparsons**: Have you guys used them before?
**Speaker 4**: Yes.
**Cody.page**: Perfect.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, these cats do most of our in rack sprinkling.
**Cody.page**: Oh, nice.
**Mparsons**: And they're local to Jersey?
**Speaker 4**: Yeah, they're like Philadelphia area.
**Cody.page**: Oh, okay.
**Mparsons**: Yeah, that's not far.
**Mparsons**: Okay, we'll move line tomorrow and yeah, let me know what you're on your Electrician says.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Okay, so before we go, I want to.
**Joseph.burdzy**: I want to share this.
**Joseph.burdzy**: We were talking about those drops.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Yes.
**Joseph.burdzy**: During yesterday's meeting.
**Joseph.burdzy**: So they went to check them this morning.
**Joseph.burdzy**: They're actually data drops.
**Joseph.burdzy**: So this is what they have on site.
**Joseph.burdzy**: But I guess the same thing would apply because these are the exact locations that we have power and data.
**Joseph.burdzy**: So it looks like they already have data drops there.
**Joseph.burdzy**: And Mike was able to trace all of them and to connect to see where they all connect to the cabinets.
**Joseph.burdzy**: And there are three locations where they are connected.
**Joseph.burdzy**: And this is what is.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Was there.
**Joseph.burdzy**: So I guess the question is, is that something that you guys would use or you guys could use?
**Mparsons**: I mean, that looks like an IDF tab.
**Speaker 4**: Yes.
**Cody.page**: Yeah.
**Mparsons**: I mean, I would think the data drops have to.
**Mparsons**: Have to come from there.
**Cody.page**: Right?
**Joseph.burdzy**: That's where they are.
**Joseph.burdzy**: They're coming from.
**Jdawson**: Where's the power coming from?
**Joseph.burdzy**: So I think they thought at first it was power drops, but they actually.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Data drops.
**Jdawson**: Oh, that's all that's there.
**Cody.page**: Yeah.
**Speaker 4**: Yes.
**Mparsons**: This Art requirements or is this.
**Mparsons**: We do need data drops.
**Mparsons**: Yeah, I know we need data drops, but this drawing is of ours.
**Mparsons**: That's not the customer draw.
**Joseph.burdzy**: This one.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Yeah, this is.
**Joseph.burdzy**: This is from Ahmet Team.
**Cody.page**: Yeah.
**Joseph.burdzy**: So that we marked on it with these red and green lines, but.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Mparsons**: Yeah, because it looks like that's where.
**Speaker 4**: They'Re trying to match with the pile drops.
**Mparsons**: It might be.
**Cody.page**: Yeah.
**Mparsons**: Because that's where their tables are going to be.
**Mparsons**: I bet that's.
**Mparsons**: Those are drops for their stuff.
**Cody.page**: Yeah.
**Joseph.burdzy**: So I guess there's only a few.
**Joseph.burdzy**: These three locations that don't have the traps that would still need both power and data.
**Cody.page**: Yeah.
**Speaker 4**: Yeah.
**Speaker 4**: There's two cabinets.
**Joseph.burdzy**: It's three.
**Joseph.burdzy**: One, two, three.
**Speaker 4**: Just so y' all know that the L cabinet over there, that one is outside of our construction area.
**Speaker 4**: Just outside of it.
**Cody.page**: Yeah.
**Mparsons**: It's probably up on a column, right?
**Cody.page**: Yep.
**Cody.page**: Yeah.
**Mparsons**: Do we care?
**Mparsons**: We don't care where the drops come from.
**Mparsons**: They just need to be networked together in the end.
**Speaker 4**: We can start anywhere at the end.
**Mparsons**: Anywhere.
**Cody.page**: Because it's like a loop.
**Cody.page**: Yeah.
**Mparsons**: But do we have permission from the customer to use that or is there a separate one?
**Mparsons**: Yeah, I think they'll be okay with it, though.
**Cody.page**: I don't know.
**Cody.page**: I guess.
**Cody.page**: I don't know.
**Mparsons**: I guess we need to bring this up in the Wednesday meeting.
**Mparsons**: I mean, if there's drops already there and we can plug into them, I mean, and they say we can use them, then we can use them.
**Mparsons**: But I mean, we don't know how their network topology works there.
**Cody.page**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: And like you said, if it's like, hey, these are already there.
**Mparsons**: And you know, if you.
**Mparsons**: If you bring up, it's going to save you money not to run another one.
**Mparsons**: You know, they like hearing that.
**Cody.page**: Yeah.
**Speaker 4**: So.
**Mparsons**: Let'S, let's.
**Mparsons**: Let's table this for next one's done.
**Cody.page**: Okay.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Sounds good.
**Speaker 4**: Keela, are you able to share this drawing, this document?
**Joseph.burdzy**: Yes, I can.
**Joseph.burdzy**: I'm gonna send it after this meeting.
**Mparsons**: Thank you, Kilo.
**Cody.page**: You're welcome.
**Mparsons**: All right, guys, I appreciate you jumping on short notice.
**Mparsons**: I guess we'll talk tomorrow.
**Cody.page**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Appreciate it.
**Cody.page**: Thank you.
**Mparsons**: Have a good one.
**Cody.page**: Thanks.
**Cody.page**: Bye.
