## Transcript
**Aaskew**: So see who we got here.
**Aaskew**: Maria's jumping on.
**Avelina**: I did email Hannah, so we need a zoom link.
**Aaskew**: Yeah, we did zoom last time.
**Aaskew**: So here, Ben Golden's trying to jump in here.
**Bclymer**: So there we go.
**Bclymer**: Brandon, how are you?
**Avelina**: Doing well, how are you?
**Bclymer**: I'm okay, Mr. Sablini.
**Bclymer**: How are you, sir?
**Bclymer**: Doing good.
**Aaskew**: How are you doing, Ben?
**Bclymer**: I'm okay.
**Bclymer**: So, Brandon, let me tell you a little bit about where I am.
**Bclymer**: Number one, I ran the numbers.
**Bclymer**: I can go through it with you.
**Bclymer**: Here's my challenge.
**Bclymer**: I got some medical news.
**Bclymer**: I've been having some medical challenges and I got some medical news recently, and I'm not going to be able to institute this plan.
**Bclymer**: I have a colleague that can.
**Bclymer**: That does it.
**Bclymer**: I'm going to stop selling these plans because I personally can't continue both the maintenance and the sale of the plans and continue to do all that and have the medical issues that I have.
**Bclymer**: So I want to sort of know your idea before we move forward, because I don't.
**Bclymer**: I don't want to.
**Bclymer**: I respect Daniel and you enough to be 100% transparent and honest with you, especially in those regards.
**Bclymer**: And I.
**Bclymer**: What I don't want to do is tell you I can do something and then, you know, a month down the road after you make this investment, be like, I'm not the one to do it.
**Bclymer**: I don't want to be that guy.
**Bclymer**: So I would rather be 100% upfront and honest and transparent with you going in than I would any other way.
**Bclymer**: I'm more than happy to go through the step ladder strategy with you and tell you a little bit about it, but I wouldn't be the one to institute it with you.
**Bclymer**: We could do the maintenance side of it.
**Bclymer**: I'm going to continue doing the maintenance side of it.
**Bclymer**: Let me rephrase that.
**Bclymer**: My team will be able to.
**Bclymer**: I'm going to make a digital program.
**Bclymer**: That way my team can respond and there will be less of me personally doing it.
**Bclymer**: And the stepladder is a deferral strategy.
**Bclymer**: And I know we've already talked about it and everything, and I've even had to put our meeting on hold more than one time in regards to some of the health concerns that I've been dealing with.
**Bclymer**: So I really want to be 100, 100% transparent with you.
**Bclymer**: And this is sort of taking Daniel and his team back as well.
**Bclymer**: My cardiologist from yesterday.
**Bclymer**: I just don't have some news that I need to continue down the path that I have been in the past several years.
**Bclymer**: You know what I mean?
**Avelina**: Yeah, I get it.
**Avelina**: I mean, you know, health comes first.
**Avelina**: So I, I'm sorry you're going through that, you know, definitely be thinking about you.
**Avelina**: But yeah, I mean, obviously, like, you know, this strategy, you know, as far as what I can tell, you know, is, is, you know, kind of the best one out there, you know, as far as working with a colleague.
**Avelina**: I mean, if they have experience setting this up and they know what they're doing, you vouch for them and stuff, then, you know, I'm not opposed to that.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Avelina**: So, I mean, that would be my biggest qualifier is, you know, again, do.
**Bclymer**: They know it's the same attorney?
**Bclymer**: It's the same attorney that I would use for the trusts and more any more than anything else.
**Bclymer**: It's the same attorney that I'll be using for the trust.
**Bclymer**: It's the same.
**Bclymer**: Everything is exactly the same.
**Bclymer**: Except I would not be the one personally overseeing everything.
**Bclymer**: My team would be.
**Bclymer**: And the service that we would give you is more digitally based.
**Bclymer**: Instead of time with me, specifically, as of right now, I'm working, I have multiple jobs, but I'm working from, you know, 5:00am until 10 or 11:00pm every day.
**Bclymer**: And if I don't make some radical changes personally, medically, you know, I'm physically working myself to death.
**Bclymer**: And I've been doing this for, you know, over a decade so, or decades.
**Bclymer**: So, you know, I want to be transparent with you.
**Bclymer**: I think that this plan and everything is the right strategy and we can still support you from the maintenance side.
**Bclymer**: I just don't think that I'm the right fit to put it in play with you.
**Bclymer**: I can get you in touch with David Corey.
**Bclymer**: He can institute and put it in play with you and then Jeff can do it as well.
**Bclymer**: And my team can support you.
**Bclymer**: If you need me, I'm in the background.
**Bclymer**: But there again, Brandon, I want to be 100% transparent with you.
**Avelina**: Yeah, no, I get it.
**Avelina**: I mean, you know, you, you know, even if you took it on and you work yourself and you're dead in, you know, six months, that doesn't nobody any good.
**Avelina**: So I totally get it.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So we can do one of two things.
**Bclymer**: I can go through sort of the presentation I was going to go through with my investment is a little bit more than what my colleague's investment is because I did a lot of things that are included in the initial investment.
**Bclymer**: And Brandon, I'm more than happy to go over that with you.
**Bclymer**: That the logistics don't change, it's just who you're working with changes a little bit more than anything else, and your cost would go down slightly.
**Avelina**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: In this.
**Bclymer**: So I'm, I'm more than happy to go over that with you, but I.
**Bclymer**: There, again, I care more about being transparent with you and being 100 solid from that standpoint than I.
**Bclymer**: Then I care about just the cell itself.
**Avelina**: Yeah, no, I get it.
**Avelina**: So, yeah, I mean, that's fine.
**Avelina**: You know, I mean, obviously we'll, you know, meet with, you know, whoever the, whatever the other guy's name is and make sure that, that, you know, there's cohesion there.
**Avelina**: But.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, so let me, let me do this right here real quick.
**Bclymer**: I'm going to pull up the plan and just go over it with you real quick and present it.
**Bclymer**: I know that the investment, the return on investment is going to be a little bit different, so I want to talk to you about that, too.
**Bclymer**: So give me one moment, Sam.
**Bclymer**: I'm going to share my screen real quick.
**Bclymer**: Okay?
**Avelina**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: Let me know when you can see it.
**Avelina**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Great.
**Bclymer**: And then let me know if you can see my laser pointer.
**Avelina**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: So we'll go over sort of the goals.
**Bclymer**: They're not going to change the history, the projections for you, the, the plan, the savings, the moving part, and the investment definitely is going to change slightly for you as well.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So we do this for three reasons.
**Bclymer**: Number one, asset protection, number two, income tax reduction, and number three, I talk about estate tax reductions, but I care more about the legacy that you have than just the estate tax reduction itself.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Now, the exemption was slated to go down from the 13 million.
**Bclymer**: The one big beautiful bill that came through with Trump.
**Bclymer**: I believe it set to continue forward.
**Bclymer**: I'll have to double check that exemption amount.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: When I look at 22, 3 and 4, you know, everything here is sort of blended together, and your gross income for the business has been doing nothing but going up over the years.
**Bclymer**: And so if I go back and look at these right here, you know, the, the taxable income for you has gone up for 23 and 4 versus 22.
**Bclymer**: And you see that total tax went up slightly and then down just a little bit, even though you have a little of a rise here.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Now, with that being said, you know, your W2, we said it's going to roughly be about the same.
**Bclymer**: We would want to do a reasonable comp study to make sure your W2.
**Avelina**: Yeah, we, we just bumped it up to 130.
**Bclymer**: Okay, good, good.
**Aaskew**: So that, that as well for this year.
**Bclymer**: You got that reasonable comp Done, Daniel?
**Avelina**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay, good.
**Bclymer**: We did say that, you know, there's some slight increases over 25, 6 and 7, and then a little bit of a dip in 28 and 9.
**Bclymer**: I said that strictly because I want to show you that this still works, even if your income goes down Great.
**Bclymer**: A little bit.
**Bclymer**: And the goal is for us to move about 70% of profit into the trusts, if we at all possibly can.
**Bclymer**: So when I look at that, you know, your income moving up year after year and then going down slightly, you can see that your tax is about flat for these periods as well.
**Bclymer**: And so when I get into the tax, you can see that it's moving up slightly as the income would move up.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Now we said, you know, 567, you're still going to have roughly a 10% increase.
**Bclymer**: Is that going to.
**Bclymer**: You think that would be about right or what?
**Avelina**: No, I mean, you know, I'm working on.
**Avelina**: I should close a deal here in November.
**Avelina**: It'll be, you know, a little over a billion dollars over the course of five years, so talking 200 million a year.
**Bclymer**: So this is, this is.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: This is so very conservative.
**Bclymer**: So very conservative.
**Bclymer**: So then, you know, with, with that being said, this ROI is going to be really, really small compared to the numbers that you just gave me.
**Bclymer**: So the investment is going to be small as compared to.
**Bclymer**: Compared to the savings.
**Bclymer**: Ultimately.
**Bclymer**: I just want to make sure that in looking at these numbers, we know that these numbers are very conservative and the savings are still there.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: This is sort of the trust.
**Bclymer**: If things went up like we were talking about, this is the taxes that you would pay not within respect to the sale that you're about to make.
**Bclymer**: But you can see this is the tax on the trust itself, and it's under the $50,000 mark.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: So the goal is on us looking at this is how do we own nothing but control it all?
**Bclymer**: If we own it and control it, we're going to pay tax on it.
**Bclymer**: There's going to be less asset protection, and then there is going to be estate taxes.
**Bclymer**: We do not want to take control away because we want you to have decisions.
**Bclymer**: So what we do is we remove ownership and you have control.
**Bclymer**: So with these trusts, you know, the way it works is money would flow from.
**Bclymer**: Well, first, we have two trusts involved.
**Bclymer**: Okay?
**Bclymer**: You have your business, we have the business trust, and we have the family trust, and we have you, okay?
**Bclymer**: And so when we look at the control structure, you still own the business, and then we have the business trust where you're the trustee of that entity and the family trust, and you're the trustee of that entity.
**Bclymer**: And then the assets ultimately land inside the family trust.
**Bclymer**: So the family trust would purchase a home for you.
**Bclymer**: The family trust would purchase, let's say, a skiing.
**Bclymer**: A skiing condo or a beach condo or home or whatever it is that the trust decided that it needed to invest into.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: And the business would have a beneficiary of the family trust.
**Bclymer**: Okay, questions on sort of how the control would go?
**Avelina**: No.
**Avelina**: Are those.
**Avelina**: Are those irrevocable trusts?
**Bclymer**: They are irrevocable.
**Bclymer**: So let's say, Brandon, at the end of the day, you said, I want out.
**Bclymer**: Just, I don't care about the tax implications, I just want out.
**Bclymer**: We can do that.
**Bclymer**: And so this is a deferral strategy more than anything else.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And it's going to defer as long as the income sits inside the family trust and it defers in perpetuity until one of two things happens.
**Bclymer**: Number one, Brandon takes it out for himself, or number two, Brandon decides to give the money to a beneficiary.
**Avelina**: And so this is as far as the individual.
**Avelina**: That.
**Avelina**: That's me.
**Avelina**: Correct?
**Bclymer**: That's you.
**Bclymer**: That's correct.
**Bclymer**: This is you.
**Avelina**: So individual.
**Avelina**: And then I'm the trustee for both those.
**Bclymer**: That's right.
**Avelina**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And so if you needed some money to live off of, you can do that, because you can't just take money out of the trust and not be taxed on it.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Avelina**: Which is why I need to borrow the money.
**Avelina**: Correct.
**Bclymer**: You can.
**Bclymer**: You can borrow the money, but there has to be.
**Bclymer**: It has to be done with life insurance, because there has.
**Bclymer**: That loan has to be collateralized in some shape, form or fashion, and we usually collateralize it with a death benefit.
**Avelina**: Gotcha.
**Avelina**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Avelina**: That's how.
**Avelina**: That's how I get my walking around money.
**Bclymer**: Or.
**Bclymer**: Or you still get paid from the business.
**Bclymer**: You still get your W2 wage.
**Bclymer**: You still get money from the business here.
**Bclymer**: Because when we look at cash flow, the cash flow structure, let's say the business itself is going to pay money into the business trust because either a management fee or a lease or royalty.
**Bclymer**: And we had talked.
**Bclymer**: We had talked about that a little bit.
**Bclymer**: So this right here is 97%.
**Bclymer**: What happens if we only rolled it to 70?
**Bclymer**: And now you have 30% of the income yourself from the business.
**Avelina**: Right.
**Bclymer**: You have your W2 and 30%.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: And so if you took, let's say, $5 million a year for yourself and rolled the rest of the money into the family trust, you know, you're going to be paying 37% of $5 million instead of 37% of, you know, $100 million.
**Bclymer**: And that's.
**Aaskew**: You can still get a K1 and such, too, right, Ben?
**Bclymer**: Absolutely.
**Bclymer**: So this business is still going to operate, you know, just like this.
**Bclymer**: The business is going to be owned by you, and the money will flow through to land into the trust.
**Bclymer**: And the question is, you know, you get your $130,000 W2 and then a couple other million dollars to do with it what you want, you know?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, that way.
**Bclymer**: That way the lion's share of the funds still land in the family trust, and it's deferred.
**Aaskew**: The trust essentially can stack with a lot of what I do entirely in house, Brandon, with the.
**Aaskew**: The corporate structures.
**Aaskew**: So people in that type of setup, they're still kind of capping out their top tax rate around 21 points.
**Aaskew**: They're getting half a mil to a mil a year and like that.
**Bclymer**: And so this.
**Bclymer**: And the other.
**Bclymer**: And the other thing that it stops inside, you know, because there's always a pro and a con to everything that you do inside all of the strategies.
**Bclymer**: So one of the things it does for Daniel's corporate structures is we don't have to worry about any type of accumulated earnings taxes as well.
**Bclymer**: So it gets rid of some of those other challenges that every structure has, you know, because there's a pro and a con to everything.
**Bclymer**: The cons here, Let me tell you about the con, number one, is say that you buy an asset for a million dollars and you pay cash for that asset.
**Bclymer**: If that asset is inside the trust, no bank is going to lend to it.
**Bclymer**: And the reason is because the asset protection of this trust is so strong that the banks feel like that they cannot claw that asset back out once they lend money to the trust.
**Avelina**: Right.
**Avelina**: But if.
**Avelina**: If the business buys it and I still own the business.
**Bclymer**: That's right.
**Bclymer**: It's outside the structure and the business can borrow money.
**Bclymer**: That's exactly right.
**Avelina**: And so what if I had a liquidation event on the business?
**Avelina**: Let's say I sell the business for.
**Bclymer**: 30 million bucks, whatever, then, then what we do is we're gonna.
**Bclymer**: We're gonna have the business valued.
**Bclymer**: And there are some tax court cases that say that you own this business and the intellectual property in the business.
**Bclymer**: Now, if there's hard intellectual property or soft intellectual property, you own the soft.
**Bclymer**: Now, soft intellectual property is things like URLs.
**Bclymer**: Soft intellectual property.
**Bclymer**: Hard intellectual property is things like patents and copyrights and things of that nature.
**Bclymer**: So what we do is we can sell those hard intellectual properties to you from the business and then sell it from the business, from you into the family trust and turn around and have that royalty go back for both hard and soft intellectual property.
**Bclymer**: Now you are going to own the soft intellectual property.
**Bclymer**: And that's because tax court has.
**Bclymer**: Has already said that you own that.
**Bclymer**: And there's tax court cases that say that the Bras trucking case, where he owned the intellectual property, individually sold it, and he.
**Bclymer**: He sold the company.
**Bclymer**: It was a C corp.
**Bclymer**: He sold the company, and he personally had to pay tax on intellectual property.
**Bclymer**: The reason why we did that is to avoid the double taxation inside a C corp.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: So what we do is Brandon's going to turn in and sell it to the family trust.
**Bclymer**: And now the family trust can have a royalty that charges the business because the family trust owns the ip and that's where that royalty comes from.
**Avelina**: So you're saying when the business sells, let's say it sells for whatever, 30.
**Bclymer**: Let's say 30, $30 million, $10 million, whatever the number is, since the family trust owns the intellectual property, it owns the goodwill, then most of the sale would land inside the family trust.
**Avelina**: Gotcha.
**Bclymer**: So of this $30 million tax deferred.
**Bclymer**: That's right.
**Bclymer**: Of the $30 million, let's say 10 million of it would be taxed and 20 million of it would be deferred.
**Bclymer**: You know, and that's.
**Bclymer**: And you would receive the $10 million that were taxed.
**Bclymer**: We literally just did this for a landscaping company.
**Bclymer**: It was a $50 million sale.
**Bclymer**: Six million of it was him getting, receiving equity in the purchaser.
**Bclymer**: 14 million of it will is cash that will be received at a later date.
**Bclymer**: So that means that 20 million of the 50 will be received at a later date, and he's going to be taxed on the 30 million that he receives.
**Bclymer**: Of the 30 million that he received, roughly 10 of it was for equipment.
**Bclymer**: And that equipment could not be moved into the trust because of the way section 1245 and assets work.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So he'll be taxed on that 10 million of the 30 and the other 20 million will be deferred.
**Avelina**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: One of the things we always want to talk about is the family trust is it can take care of your normal living standards, but it's never going to pay for your fun, it's never going to pay for your food or your groceries, and it's never going to pay you for your fashion.
**Bclymer**: So that's why, Brandon, you Need to have a W2 wage or money coming in personally so your entertainment can be paid for out of the trust.
**Bclymer**: I mean, excuse me, out of your personal and not in the trust.
**Avelina**: But then I can also do again the insurance thing and borrow against that for walking around money to pay for food, fun and fashion.
**Bclymer**: Absolutely.
**Bclymer**: Just remember that you would still have to pay that interest on a, let's say quarterly basis or something like that.
**Bclymer**: You're still going to have to pay that interest.
**Avelina**: Right.
**Avelina**: But that's fine.
**Avelina**: I'm just going to borrow again and refill the coffers and keep paying.
**Bclymer**: So we have to be careful because there's a max limit that we can borrow.
**Bclymer**: Ultimately we just don't want to go above that.
**Bclymer**: So if that happens, then you may have to take some personal income from the trust to pay for it.
**Avelina**: What's the max limit?
**Bclymer**: You can borrow 90% of the cash value of the life insurance plan.
**Avelina**: Right.
**Avelina**: So I just get another insurance plan.
**Bclymer**: Exactly.
**Avelina**: Yeah, yeah, I get that.
**Avelina**: I mean, yeah, I mean you just as, as my, as my company grows and I grow and everything, I can go and you know, I, oh, I had a million dollar death benefit before on this, this, this and it's like, hey, Now I'm worth XYZ.
**Avelina**: I need 5 million and 10 million and just.
**Avelina**: Yeah.
**Aaskew**: Of options.
**Aaskew**: There's, there's going to be balance to be had between like playing a borrowing strat like that and just taking some personal money.
**Aaskew**: Because by putting all this income under the trust and stuff set of yourself, you're no longer at this huge bracket from the get go.
**Aaskew**: You can start out with small brackets, leverage those and then play the rest into that.
**Bclymer**: And, and remember the, the trust is going to own the asset.
**Bclymer**: So there again, if you want that lake home or if you want that, you know, ski home, village home or whatever, the trust can purchase those investments and then you can go stay in there as a trustee to make sure that everything is okay with the, the property.
**Bclymer**: And then if the trust wanted to rent that property out, it could, or maybe not.
**Bclymer**: You know, it could have those as, as rental properties during season and you could go in off season or go during season, whatever it is that you want to do.
**Bclymer**: You know what I mean?
**Avelina**: And what about my personal home?
**Avelina**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Trust can own it.
**Bclymer**: Now here's the thing, because you stay inside that home, you would have what we call a K, a caretaker lease.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So that means that you would rent the room that you stay in, not the entire house.
**Avelina**: Perfect.
**Bclymer**: So and there again, remember that's how we get the business is ultimately going to pay you some money here.
**Bclymer**: And then you turn around and have to pay a little bit of the assets, a little bit into the family trust for that caretaker list to live in that asset.
**Bclymer**: You see?
**Avelina**: Right.
**Bclymer**: And if you wanted the trust to purchase, let's say an exotic car, it can do that.
**Avelina**: Perfect.
**Bclymer**: We do have an attorney opinion letter.
**Bclymer**: All this is done through an attorney.
**Bclymer**: There's a private letter ruling that talks about how some of these, some of the income can be deferred.
**Bclymer**: And we do have some, a zero change audit letter for a colleague of mine that went through audit.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: You cannot do this to avoid child support and you cannot do it if there is a, if an asset goes into the trust fraudulently.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So we just want to make sure that those are some exceptions that you cannot do.
**Bclymer**: Ultimately I say that it's going to save you 80 to 85% taxes.
**Bclymer**: I'm conservative and I say 70.
**Bclymer**: Everything is built off of 70.
**Bclymer**: I think the numbers that we have here are very conservative.
**Bclymer**: So, you know, based off of these projections and what we have here, you know, you would pay about $875,000 in tax based off of these projections during that five year period.
**Bclymer**: And with the trusts you would have a $93,000 tax for all five of the years.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So the difference between the deltas here is going to be your savings.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Which is going to be about 785 during those five years without anything else changing.
**Bclymer**: Now in reality it's going to be so much greater.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, in reality.
**Bclymer**: And so we do have a maintenance package that is going to change.
**Bclymer**: And we have a company called P3.
**Bclymer**: It's peace, protection and posterity is the, that's the three Ps.
**Bclymer**: But we do have a White Glow concierge service that we encourage you to participate in and we teach you how to be a trustee and we make sure that there are redundant systems in place.
**Bclymer**: So if something happens to me, you're going to be taken care of.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So that's, that's one of the things that we do.
**Bclymer**: We're never on any of your accounts as a signature.
**Bclymer**: We, we have digitally and technologically advanced systems to make money movement seamless.
**Bclymer**: But honestly, we never had a client take us up on that.
**Bclymer**: We just tell you, hey, move the money yourself and you do it.
**Bclymer**: We encourage you to have the business trust and the family trust at the same bank so you can make that money movement seamless.
**Bclymer**: You can always ach it from your Business into your business trust and then move it from your business trust into your family trust as well.
**Bclymer**: Either Ach wires cost too much money in my opinion.
**Avelina**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: There again, trust maintenance is about $25,000 a year.
**Avelina**: Does that change with the size or anything?
**Avelina**: Or is that no matter if it's.
**Bclymer**: 20 million or 200, the assets don't matter.
**Bclymer**: What matters is the number of transactions when we do our bookkeeping.
**Bclymer**: Typically you see a lot more transactions when you have A, you know, $100 million versus a million dollars and the assets are larger and there's just more conversations.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Avelina**: So when you see like transactions you're talking about like if I go, if the family trust buys a car and a house and, and I take a withdrawal, like that stuff.
**Avelina**: Or you're talking about transactions.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, so, so like, like for example, if you, if the trust has a credit card and there's 700 transactions a month on, that's going to cost you more than having a credit card that has 100 transactions on it.
**Avelina**: Why would you trust have a credit card?
**Bclymer**: We would encourage you to put all trust expenses on a credit card and not use a debit card because a debit card is not as safe as a credit card.
**Avelina**: Okay, let me rephrase.
**Avelina**: Why would a trust have a card.
**Bclymer**: In general, so it can pay for the expenses of the assets.
**Bclymer**: So for example, on your home, if you wanted to pay for the insurance on your personal residence and the trust owns the personal residence, you can just put it on the credit card.
**Bclymer**: And since it's an asset of the trust and the trust just paid a credit card instead of doing a debit.
**Avelina**: Card, I guess I'm just thinking, I'm like, okay, like insurance makes sense and stuff, which I mean, you could also, you know, you're paying it once a year, you can pay the check.
**Avelina**: Right.
**Avelina**: But like to when you're like, oh, if you're having 700 transactions, I'm like, well, what, what would you be putting on a credit card that often?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So beneficiaries would probably get their own credit card.
**Bclymer**: And as long as it's paid to a third party, that's an expense typically that they can use because of something called hims H E M s Health, education, maintenance, support for the beneficiary.
**Bclymer**: So for example, let's say that one of your children went to an Ivy League college.
**Bclymer**: Well, that tuition, since it's education, could be paid for out of the trust, same way with a grandchild.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Not only can you pay the education, but you can Pay for the health, education, maintenance and support for the beneficiary.
**Bclymer**: So they may pay for automobile gas, they may pay for their food, they may pay for their clothing.
**Bclymer**: Trustee and a beneficiary are different in that, in that sense.
**Bclymer**: So I have one client, has his son at college, gave him a credit card.
**Bclymer**: Now it does have a limit, spending limit on it, of course, and it should, but you know, he has, you know, 100, 150 transactions a month, you know, things like that.
**Bclymer**: So just to give you.
**Avelina**: So I as a trustee can do it, but like a beneficiary, like for instance, I have a twin brother, he could be a beneficiary.
**Avelina**: Yeah.
**Avelina**: And so then I could buy him clothes.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, no, no, no, the trust could buy him clothes.
**Avelina**: That's what I mean.
**Bclymer**: So, so I mean, there again, one of the things that we teach you.
**Avelina**: How to be the same size.
**Bclymer**: Perfect.
**Bclymer**: The good thing is that what we do is we teach you how to be a trustee to spend the money the right way.
**Bclymer**: And if it's not spent the right way, or let's say for example, something came out of your personal account, well, the trust is going to reimburse you personally.
**Bclymer**: But we want things to come out of the trust account as much as we possibly can.
**Bclymer**: You know what I mean?
**Avelina**: So the earlier you said, you know, food, fun, fashion.
**Avelina**: I can't purchase those things, you know, trust money for myself, but yes, I could.
**Bclymer**: For beneficiaries, yes you can.
**Bclymer**: But you and your spouse would be the trustees.
**Avelina**: But like, but again, like my brother, if I wanted to buy my brother a, a Patek watch and he's been, I could technically do that with.
**Bclymer**: So the trust.
**Bclymer**: The trust can own it and the beneficiary can wear it.
**Bclymer**: Absolutely.
**Avelina**: Interesting.
**Avelina**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yep, Absolutely.
**Bclymer**: I've got, I've got one client that loves Legos and collects Legos and he has hundred thousand dollar Lego collection.
**Bclymer**: And the trust, when he sees more Legos, I guess he buys a lot of them and he keeps them all in the box, by the way.
**Bclymer**: All in Saran Wrap.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: He doesn't put them together.
**Bclymer**: These, these are just investments.
**Bclymer**: Like for example, if you would have done that to some of the Star wars things that came out, you know, 20 years ago, you would be very wealthy right now.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: And so that's one of the things that he invests in.
**Bclymer**: But you know, we move that collection to the trust.
**Aaskew**: Pity.
**Aaskew**: I busted all that stuff out of the packages on Christmas morning.
**Bclymer**: I should have kept it.
**Bclymer**: I don't think that he will but he just, he just has all these packages, right?
**Bclymer**: Maybe, maybe he does some of them, but I don't know.
**Bclymer**: But that's just an example of, you know, if you think that it's a great investment for the trust to have a watch collection, things that are more personal like that in nature, you need to make sure it's a collection and not just one piece.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: So for example, if in that, in that instance you would want to have an AP and a Patek and you know, all of the Rolex and all these other things there again, as trustee, it is your duty to make sure that things run properly.
**Bclymer**: So yeah, it's okay for you to have that chest of self winding, you know, things for those watches to make sure that the investment is, you know, take.
**Bclymer**: Well taken care of.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Avelina**: And then I could technically wear it, correct or no?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, you can.
**Bclymer**: I mean, it doesn't hurt for you to, to wear it ever so often.
**Bclymer**: You know, you just have to be careful.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: So if it's going to be an everyday wear, maybe that's something you buy for yourself and have the trust have some assets that it invests in.
**Bclymer**: But you know, every once in a while you want to sell one of those assets and maybe make some money on it or whatever.
**Bclymer**: These things are investments.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: I'm a man.
**Bclymer**: I. Brandon, I love watches.
**Avelina**: I mean, I'm wearing a, I'm wearing a Patek right now.
**Avelina**: Like I like watches.
**Bclymer**: Absolutely.
**Bclymer**: And there's, there's nothing wrong with that.
**Bclymer**: So, you know, the trust absolutely can do that.
**Avelina**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: But I mean, there, there becomes a.
**Bclymer**: There, there becomes like a little limit.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: The thought of it, you know.
**Avelina**: Yeah.
**Avelina**: And I mean, again, it's.
**Avelina**: If everything's taken care of, my discretionary income from my W2 becomes much, much.
**Avelina**: It goes way farther.
**Bclymer**: Exactly.
**Bclymer**: I mean, you think about it.
**Bclymer**: What's one of the number one expenses that you have?
**Bclymer**: It's your home.
**Bclymer**: You think about how much money you spend on your home on a monthly basis.
**Bclymer**: Well, you take all of that away and now the trust pays for that.
**Bclymer**: A lot of your expenses essentially go away.
**Aaskew**: Realistically, I think if you're taking as much as you can without hitting anything resembling a higher tax rate, as far as effective tax rates goes, you, you're probably just going to be sitting on cash because all that major overhead is gone.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: And, and you're going to, you're going to take some of that money and put it in your pocket from your business.
**Bclymer**: You're just going to.
**Bclymer**: And there's Absolutely nothing wrong with that.
**Bclymer**: But the thought is, if you make, let's say, $10 million in a year and you take 7 of that 10 million and you roll it into this structure, then literally, of that $7 million you just saved, let's call it 37% of that 7 million, and you know, that's.
**Bclymer**: That's a lot of money.
**Avelina**: Yeah, absolutely.
**Bclymer**: I mean, you just literally saved, you know, $2.83 million in one year off of that $10 million, and you still put three in your pocket.
**Bclymer**: Now you're.
**Bclymer**: Of that $3 million you put in your pocket, you're still going to pay, you know, a million dollars tax on it, but you just say two.
**Avelina**: Yeah.
**Avelina**: I mean, I'm not.
**Avelina**: Again, I'm not one of those guys.
**Avelina**: It's like, I don't.
**Avelina**: I want to pay zero taxes.
**Avelina**: Like that.
**Avelina**: That's not.
**Avelina**: I don't believe that.
**Avelina**: It's not.
**Avelina**: Right.
**Avelina**: Like the thing where the government and I disagree is how much I should pay.
**Avelina**: Yeah, like, I agree I should pay.
**Avelina**: I just don't agree on how much I should make.
**Avelina**: I think 40 is a little heavy.
**Avelina**: Mm.
**Bclymer**: So with, with me, the investment for me for the plan is 150.
**Bclymer**: We can do 50% down and 50% over six months, or if you wanted to make a one time payment, I give you a 15% discount.
**Bclymer**: Now, my 150 includes things that, like, for example, includes the first six months worth of maintenance fees.
**Bclymer**: It includes the trusts, it includes five years worth of legal fees for anything done inside the trusts.
**Bclymer**: So that's what my investment includes my, my colleague.
**Bclymer**: It does not include, for example, six months worth of maintenance for me.
**Bclymer**: But there again, six months of maintenance is only 13 grand.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: So you're not talking tons and tons of money there.
**Avelina**: What's the, what's the timeline, so, of getting this set up?
**Bclymer**: Usually takes four to six weeks to set up.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And then the funding process starts.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So let's say that we wanted to start it right now.
**Bclymer**: So let's say we started at 8, 1, then 9, 15.
**Bclymer**: It would be set up and then we would get the bank accounts, fund it, and then assets would start being put into it.
**Bclymer**: So you would sell, let's say your house into it, and you would receive a demand note.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Avelina**: Even if I, Even if I have a mortgage on my home.
**Bclymer**: Yep, Yep.
**Bclymer**: And so the numbers as they sit right now, for every dollar that you spent with me, you would save $2.93 in taxes if paid in full with a one time payment, you save $3.11 over a five year period.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And it does include the 26 per year in maintenance as well.
**Bclymer**: What about.
**Avelina**: So, you know, on the life insurance component.
**Avelina**: Right.
**Avelina**: So like as far as, because I know, you know, if I went to whatever massmutual or whatever the big firms are, I'm not going to get the kind of plan that I need in order to borrow against, you know, so.
**Bclymer**: David, the guy that I'm going to send you to, he's an insurance expert.
**Bclymer**: And David will tell you, look, this is what you need to do and this is the people you need to go to and all that kind of stuff.
**Avelina**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So he would, he would help you on that side.
**Avelina**: Okay.
**Avelina**: Because that takes a while.
**Avelina**: Correct?
**Avelina**: From my understanding.
**Bclymer**: Mm.
**Avelina**: Yeah, because I, I basically put all this in here, I start moving stuff and funds in there, but I am limited on what I can pull out until that gets in place.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: And you know, there are some things that we could do to get you some money.
**Bclymer**: We could put a term life in a term policy in play.
**Bclymer**: That would be okay.
**Bclymer**: That would move from term to universal.
**Bclymer**: That's another thing that we could do if you wanted something faster.
**Bclymer**: But that's a temporary fix.
**Avelina**: Yeah, yeah.
**Avelina**: I mean, I, I, you know, I mean, obviously with, with you not doing it, like, I mean, the number's fine, you know, the investment, it's, you know, if we can ideally get a meeting with this guy maybe next week or something like, you know, because at the end of the day, like, you know, this is something that's pretty permanent, you know, so I gotta make sure I die.
**Bclymer**: No, it, there's no, pretty permanent to it.
**Bclymer**: It is permanent.
**Bclymer**: So it's, it's something that you'll want to use and you know, like I said, I, I'm still fully behind it.
**Bclymer**: I just am moving more to more of a digital maintenance system.
**Bclymer**: It's still going to be white glove, but there's less of me involved in the day to day.
**Avelina**: Yeah, no, I understand.
**Avelina**: So, yeah, that's fine, you know, you know, get that set up.
**Avelina**: And I mean, for me, what my goal with this was, I wanted this to be active, you know, for 2026.
**Bclymer**: Like that was this, this is still can be active in 25.
**Avelina**: Well, I know, that's what I'm saying.
**Avelina**: Like when you tell me six, six weeks, I'm like, oh, wow, that's, that's great.
**Avelina**: I didn't expect that.
**Avelina**: So I mean that's, that's, that's, you know, relief.
**Avelina**: I thought this took months and months and months.
**Bclymer**: So, no, no, we, we're, we're not interested in something that takes, you know, six to, six to nine months to put into into play.
**Bclymer**: Now it's going to take, Brandon, it's going to take you some time to learn sort of the ins and outs on what you can and should do as a trustee.
**Bclymer**: But, you know, we'll go through that and answer questions as we move forward.
**Bclymer**: But I can tell you right now, more likely than not, you know, you'll learn as you go on what you can and can't do.
**Bclymer**: But I really want you to think about, I have to keep my life, Brandon as an individual, separate from my life, Brandon as a trustee.
**Bclymer**: Those have to be completely separate from each other, even more so than what you've separated from Brandon and your business.
**Bclymer**: There needs to be a very clean, bright line between the two.
**Avelina**: So, so one, one, you know, one of my friends who has this system, he's the one that told me about it, brought me to this is, wait, the way that his is, is his trustee is actually his daughter, you know, he, like so.
**Avelina**: And technically she, I mean, she controls everything.
**Avelina**: And so he, anytime he needs money or walking around, he has, you know, technically it's through her.
**Avelina**: Is that something you're familiar with or.
**Bclymer**: Well, there's a lot of different ways you can do it.
**Bclymer**: I don't prefer to do it that way.
**Bclymer**: I set a lot of these up strictly based off of the tax code to make sure that you are not a grantor.
**Bclymer**: Now, him doing it that way, that's 100% fine.
**Bclymer**: He can't be a beneficiary.
**Avelina**: Right?
**Avelina**: He's not.
**Avelina**: And so he has to take his, his, you know, you know, his life insurance and borrowing it, walking around money.
**Avelina**: And it's the same thing as far as his cars are, you know, that he, you know, are all owned by the family trust and whatnot.
**Bclymer**: And you can do that, but you do have to have a lease back there as well.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so if you drive a daily driver of the trust, the trust owns the daily driver car, then you have to lease the car from the trust.
**Bclymer**: So the trustee should not have personal gain from the trust itself.
**Avelina**: But I thought you said that if the family trust, it could buy like a supercar or something.
**Avelina**: And then if I'm the trustee, I could still drive it.
**Bclymer**: You can, but it can't.
**Bclymer**: It can't be your daily driver.
**Avelina**: Gotcha.
**Bclymer**: If it's your daily driver, then you rent it from the trust.
**Bclymer**: You have a caretaker Lease, just like.
**Avelina**: My daily driver is a company vehicle, so it really doesn't matter then.
**Bclymer**: It doesn't matter.
**Bclymer**: So if you take the exotic car out two times a week, that's fine.
**Avelina**: Gotcha.
**Avelina**: And so when we talk about, you know, take the exotic car out two times a week or this, that the other, whatever it is, is that like, you know, people are coming in and auditing that.
**Avelina**: Like, I mean, you know, how is this tracked or known or any.
**Avelina**: You know what I mean?
**Bclymer**: I mean, it's, it's not really known a whole lot other than the fact that I don't want you to tell someone an untruth.
**Bclymer**: You know, if you were ever, if you were ever put in front of a, a judge, I just don't want you to say an untruth.
**Bclymer**: Do we document how many times you drive it?
**Bclymer**: Not necessarily, no.
**Avelina**: Okay, so yeah, you don't have to have some paperwork that says took car out Tuesday, blah, blah.
**Bclymer**: No, but I mean, here's the thing.
**Bclymer**: If the IRS had questions and they were like, okay, I'd like to see the maintenance log on the, on the exotic car.
**Bclymer**: Okay, well, you give them the maintenance log on the exotic car and there's 40,000 miles on it in a year, and they're like, okay, who drove it?
**Bclymer**: You know, and if it's one of the beneficiaries, no big deal.
**Bclymer**: But if it was you, you have to pay tax on the benefit that you receive from the trust.
**Avelina**: And so if, you know, if you lease it, I'm sure you could make the lease rate $20 a month.
**Avelina**: You got to make it.
**Bclymer**: No, it needs to be fair market value.
**Bclymer**: So I mean, if it's an exotic car, you're talking, you know, let's say fifteen hundred dollars, something like that, probably more than that.
**Bclymer**: But yeah, yeah, it could be, it could be okay if it's your, if it's your daily driver.
**Bclymer**: But you know, there again, if his.
**Aaskew**: Biggest bills are being eaten up by the trust, he needs something to spend his money on anyway.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I mean, if you, if, if you bought a $300,000 car and, you know, you drive it some and you spend $18,000 or $25,000 a month in, you know, borrow in lease payments from that vehicle, it's a lot cheaper than you personally spending 300,000.
**Avelina**: And I would think, in reality, what I would think what I could do is, you know, like, leasing is one thing, but you could also treat it like a rental, like, oh, I'm going to take it out today.
**Avelina**: You know, it's a thousand dollar rent, you know, whatever rental is or whatever.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: But as a trustee, it is your job to be the caretaker for the vehicle.
**Bclymer**: So you taking it out every so often, it is your duty to make sure that it runs in good order.
**Bclymer**: So because of that, you taking it out, you know, once a week, that no big deal, twice a week, no big deal.
**Bclymer**: But you put 50, 40,000 miles on an exotic car, you know, there has to be some sort of a.
**Bclymer**: And that's, that's sort of where people get in trouble.
**Bclymer**: I just want you to play by the rules.
**Bclymer**: If we're going to get a $2.5 million deferral of tax, I don't want you to be petty and say, oh, I don't want to pay this fifteen hundred dollar a month payment.
**Bclymer**: I mean, come on, I mean, let's play by the rules.
**Avelina**: I get it.
**Avelina**: I'm not exotic car guy anyway.
**Bclymer**: I'm just using it as an example though, you know what I mean?
**Avelina**: Yeah.
**Avelina**: And so in that, let's stick to that same scenario just for thought.
**Avelina**: So let's say that I, I did have an exotic car and I, I was driving it five days a week or whatever and you know, they come in like, what would be the penalty?
**Bclymer**: We just say that you received income or you received benefit from the trust and you pay tax on it at that time and you would receive a 10 from the trust for that item if you did not pay, if you didn't lease it back, for example.
**Avelina**: Gotcha.
**Bclymer**: So you just need to pay tax.
**Avelina**: On some big downfall, you know, thing.
**Bclymer**: Well, I mean if it become, if they see a pattern of you not following the rules the right way.
**Bclymer**: Absolutely.
**Bclymer**: It becomes a big thing.
**Avelina**: Okay.
**Aaskew**: That's also why you have the maintenance.
**Aaskew**: So it's not just you trying to figure out real time is this okay or not?
**Aaskew**: You have people to lean on, know.
**Bclymer**: Exactly.
**Avelina**: Gotcha.
**Avelina**: So I just bounced the ideas off, Hey, I want to go, you know, stay in the Aspen house for a month.
**Bclymer**: What?
**Bclymer**: It's not a problem.
**Avelina**: Gotcha.
**Bclymer**: I mean if you, if you spend, you know, a month worth of days there, let, yeah, let's stop the, let's stop the lease on your ordinary primary and let's put a lease on the secondary home.
**Bclymer**: It's not a big deal.
**Bclymer**: So I mean, let's just not make it a big deal and there's going to be a lease difference between an $800,000 home and a $4 million home.
**Bclymer**: There's, it just is, you know.
**Avelina**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So I mean, we just do it accordingly.
**Bclymer**: That's why you have to have the spend around, the knock around money too, you know?
**Avelina**: Yeah, yeah, okay, perfect.
**Avelina**: Well, so I guess, I'm sorry, what was the guy's name?
**Avelina**: Dan, Is it?
**Bclymer**: David.
**Avelina**: David.
**Bclymer**: David.
**Avelina**: I, I don't know how you want to link us up or whatever, but I, you know, I obviously meet him and.
**Avelina**: Because that's the next step.
**Avelina**: Right, Because, I mean, as far as with you.
**Bclymer**: Right, yeah, absolutely.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So that's the next step.
**Bclymer**: Let me get you in touch with him.
**Bclymer**: Primarily the same thing, same trusts and, you know, the only, the only difference is I would get your company valued.
**Bclymer**: If we're moving the intellectual property over.
**Bclymer**: He doesn't, I included in mine.
**Bclymer**: That's one thing he would not include into his.
**Bclymer**: So that cost, you know, that's an inclusive value.
**Bclymer**: Let's call it $7,500.
**Bclymer**: It's included in the 150.
**Bclymer**: And the reason I do that is because, Brandon, I set something up when I did it so that I wouldn't nickel and dime you.
**Bclymer**: I want you to know an all in number, you know, but I guess.
**Avelina**: With any of these things that you include that he doesn't, you know, the, the money, whether I pay you or pay a third party, doesn't really matter.
**Avelina**: It's.
**Avelina**: Will he facilitate it?
**Avelina**: You know, because it's like I, you know, I had no idea.
**Bclymer**: Absolutely, Absolutely the group would facilitate it.
**Bclymer**: Either he would or my company would.
**Bclymer**: Absolutely.
**Bclymer**: It would be facilitated.
**Avelina**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Because that's, that's, that's the way it works with either him or me or whomever.
**Avelina**: Okay, perfect.
**Avelina**: Well, you know, I'm sorry to hear, you know, about the medical stuff, but by all means, take care of yourself, live a long life.
**Avelina**: You deserve it.
**Avelina**: So thank you.
**Avelina**: Yeah, put us in touch.
**Avelina**: And then, you know, Maria will get on the calendar.
**Avelina**: You know, probably.
**Avelina**: I'd say maybe next week, you know, or something like that, or the week after.
**Avelina**: We'll see, you know, what works for David.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Avelina**: And go from there.
**Bclymer**: And more likely than not, it'll be next week.
**Bclymer**: It wouldn't be a problem.
**Avelina**: Yeah, that's fine.
**Avelina**: I, I know I'm, I think I'm traveling, but we'll, we'll figure out.
**Avelina**: Okay?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah, whatever, whatever we need to do.
**Bclymer**: Well, I, I really appreciate it.
**Bclymer**: Thank you so much.
**Bclymer**: Can I answer any other, other questions?
**Avelina**: No, I mean, I think that's it.
**Avelina**: You know, it's all, you know, pretty good.
**Avelina**: I, I don't know if, like, I, I, you know, some of those, you know, court, you know, renderings or some of that stuff.
**Avelina**: Like, I.
**Avelina**: If you've got some of that documentation.
**Avelina**: I don't think we ever saw that come through.
**Avelina**: I'd be eager to.
**Avelina**: To read some of that.
**Bclymer**: Daniel, did I send that?
**Aaskew**: Yeah, it was in an email that was titled, like, Proof of Legitimacy.
**Aaskew**: It was actually in that thread.
**Avelina**: Okay.
**Avelina**: I think.
**Avelina**: Maria, can you find that and put it in our tax file, please?
**Bclymer**: If you need that again, let me know, and I'll be more than happy to send that again.
**Avelina**: Okay, perfect.
**Avelina**: Cool.
**Avelina**: Thanks, guys.
**Avelina**: I appreciate it.
**Bclymer**: Thank you both.
**Avelina**: See you.
**Bclymer**: Talk soon.
**Bclymer**: Bye.
