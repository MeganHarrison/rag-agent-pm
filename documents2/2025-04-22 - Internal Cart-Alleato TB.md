## Transcript
**Ataylor**: Hey.
**Jdawson**: Likes, I'll give you one of them P Lights.
**Ataylor**: Hey, Steve, this is the Leo.
**Bclymer**: How's it going?
**Ataylor**: Not too bad.
**Ataylor**: Hey, do you already have drawings of a vault and cage for us?
**Bclymer**: No, I don't think that there's any real possibility that we actually do that.
**Bclymer**: I know John has probably told you differently, but.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I've voiced my concern and basically have said, tell me when it's worth spending time on.
**Bclymer**: And Joe said, I don't think it's worth spending time on right now.
**Ataylor**: That's good to know.
**Jdawson**: What's not worth spending time on?
**Jdawson**: What were y'all talking about?
**Bclymer**: Storage of schedule two narcotics.
**Jdawson**: Oh.
**Jdawson**: What you up to, Steve?
**Jdawson**: How you doing?
**Bclymer**: A lot with the.
**Bclymer**: Some of these other sites and some new sales opportunities, but other than that, same old.
**Bclymer**: I'm trying to get these.
**Bclymer**: I don't think you guys were on the email, but Klinga did come back and say that they have figured out how we can run at negative 75 and they will not void our warranty.
**Bclymer**: There's a list.
**Bclymer**: I'll, I'll forward you the email.
**Bclymer**: It's like some extra insulation and movement of sensors, but they said they fully tested it at their headquarters and I think it will fix our issues, so that's good.
**Speaker 3**: Hey, guys, how we doing?
**Bclymer**: Hey, AJ.
**Jdawson**: Hey, AJ.
**Ataylor**: Steve, at 1 point, I think we do need to have a conversation about those.
**Ataylor**: Like we, we never kind of close the loop on lights and put flaps in them and a couple other things.
**Ataylor**: Discussion for a different time, though.
**Jdawson**: And yeah, we still have two units that are down that, that I wouldn't put product in.
**Speaker 3**: So how, how's Everybody doing?
**Ataylor**: Hey, A.J.
**Speaker 3**: Doing okay?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Speaker 3**: So, Eric, the only updates I have.
**Speaker 3**: So I, I, we're gonna get those railings powder coated yellow for you.
**Speaker 3**: Those should be in end of next week.
**Speaker 3**: Okay.
**Speaker 3**: They're getting fabbed here into this week.
**Speaker 3**: And then we'll get those installed for you.
**Speaker 3**: Obviously, Mid South's on the concrete patch there next to the building.
**Speaker 3**: And then the only other thing I have, I need a little guidance on the window.
**Speaker 3**: You want us to cut in?
**Speaker 3**: There's that electrical panel there.
**Speaker 3**: So if we install it without moving the electrical panel, it'll be on a seam, basically the way those prefabbed.
**Speaker 3**: Yes.
**Speaker 3**: The guard shack is prefab.
**Speaker 3**: It won't be exactly in the center.
**Speaker 3**: Or we can take the time, move the electrical panel and have it match the opposite side up to you.
**Speaker 3**: Just going to take a little longer.
**Ataylor**: So my, my, my gut says let's do it.
**Ataylor**: Right.
**Ataylor**: Because the guard check's probably going to be there forever.
**Speaker 3**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Unless it's.
**Ataylor**: That's outrageously expensive because like me personally, I don't care if it's centered like, right.
**Ataylor**: I'm not going to go out there and go, oh, crap, it's, it's not aesthetically pleasing and centered.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: I mean, we, we do need to be able to see out that because right now it's got 180 degree blind spot.
**Ataylor**: Right.
**Ataylor**: We.
**Ataylor**: You can't see out the south and you can't see out going east.
**Speaker 3**: Right.
**Ataylor**: So looking at the building and.
**Jdawson**: The north.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: So that answers my question.
**Speaker 3**: I'm gonna have Mitch take a look at it and see exactly what it entails.
**Speaker 3**: Because if we did install it off centered, it wouldn't even create the, the nicest of seals because it would, it would, it would fall on.
**Speaker 3**: I don't know if it's an expansion joint or whatever.
**Speaker 3**: That panel ends.
**Speaker 3**: So we would have to silicone it in.
**Speaker 3**: So I'm gonna get Mitch out there.
**Speaker 3**: He's gonna let me know what, what it's going to take, you know, probably an electrician two days day to get that moved, and then that's the route we'll take.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Speaker 3**: So that's all I got.
**Speaker 3**: Have the gates been working good for you guys?
**Ataylor**: Yeah, no issues with the gates at all, to be honest.
**Speaker 3**: Okay, that's good.
**Speaker 3**: Nice.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, I don't have any other issues other than the, like I said, the patching the concrete.
**Jdawson**: And remember, it's two holes.
**Jdawson**: It's one by the, by the guard shack and one by the building.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, yeah, Mitch is on it.
**Speaker 3**: He, he, he's been aware of it.
**Speaker 3**: He's.
**Speaker 3**: I thought he was going to have it taken care of late last week, but I didn't want to let you know and then cancel it.
**Speaker 3**: So he's on it.
**Speaker 3**: I'll let you know here.
**Speaker 3**: I'll.
**Speaker 3**: I'll let you know here when I have a, a date locked in.
**Speaker 3**: He's supposed to get back to me later today.
**Jdawson**: Thanks, sir.
**Speaker 3**: I think that's it.
**Speaker 3**: And Steve, you got all of our information for the, the response to chains comments, right?
**Speaker 3**: That letter from jqol and then the two other responses.
**Speaker 3**: So I think phase one is pretty much closed out, right?
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Pending their response.
**Bclymer**: But yeah, hopefully.
**Bclymer**: Fingers crossed.
**Bclymer**: Knock on wood.
**Bclymer**: Should be good.
**Speaker 3**: Okay.
**Speaker 3**: Any movement on phase two?
**Speaker 3**: We're still in lease negotiations.
**Bclymer**: No.
**Bclymer**: Still.
**Bclymer**: Alden, do you guys have anything.
**Ataylor**: From.
**Bclymer**: Just the initial stuff that you're been looking at in terms of updates or timing.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: So obviously timing's getting pushed back every, every week we, we wait, you know, I lead time issues.
**Speaker 3**: We, we worked through that one long.
**Speaker 3**: We were having it like 30 weeks out for the 5 volt wire going from our transformers to the pole.
**Speaker 3**: We were able to source that.
**Speaker 3**: Now this was a month ago, but we were able to source that and get it in like six to eight weeks now.
**Speaker 3**: So the only other long lead item, you know, generators are around 12 weeks.
**Speaker 3**: Eight to 12 weeks, they're telling me RTUS eight to 12 weeks.
**Speaker 3**: So I'm still thinking four months to five months of construction.
**Speaker 3**: So that's putting us, you know, out in the fall, really.
**Speaker 3**: November being complete now.
**Speaker 4**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Got it.
**Speaker 3**: We got all of our drawings ready.
**Speaker 3**: So assuming Shane's cool with phase one, then we can give them these phase two drawings to start picking apart and then we can submit.
**Speaker 3**: And all the, all the subs are lined up and geared up ready to go.
**Jdawson**: So did we take into consideration the IDF cabinets and the WI fi, the access points and all that as far.
**Speaker 3**: As making sure they're on backup generator power or no?
**Jdawson**: Are they gonna be dropped down below the drop ceiling or.
**Bclymer**: Oh yeah, we'll, we'll, I mean, if and when we get there, we'll drop them.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, we'll take, take care of that.
**Speaker 3**: That's not a huge issue.
**Jdawson**: Now the wires are, the wires are tight.
**Jdawson**: Going to those ideas.
**Jdawson**: There's no slack.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, I mean we just, we'll just.
**Bclymer**: Have to run new wire.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, we're gonna have so many electricians there once you guys give us the go ahead.
**Speaker 3**: I mean, right now I have like, like 23 to 26 electricians planned for this job.
**Speaker 3**: So it's a, it's quite a bit of work.
**Speaker 3**: I mean between that and the, you know, the high Volt running all alongside that building.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, it's a good quarter mile run.
**Jdawson**: So MLGW does that, don't they?
**Speaker 3**: No, they do not.
**Speaker 3**: Mlgw, because it's a primary metering.
**Speaker 3**: So basically Cart will own everything from the street.
**Speaker 3**: Our pull.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, from the street, from our pull box at the street.
**Speaker 3**: So they'll just give us something there and do that tie in.
**Speaker 3**: But then Mid south has a high volt guy that's contracting with us and they'll handle everything from where MLGW gives us to our last poll.
**Speaker 3**: And then Mid south install the conduits from our transformer to the pole and pull that wire.
**Speaker 3**: Then Mid south will take everything from the transformers in.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And that's going to be overhead.
**Jdawson**: We're going to have poles.
**Speaker 3**: Correct.
**Speaker 3**: Overhead until we get to the back area.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Well, I don't think there's any way to do underground with all the ditches and drainage and.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, it would be a lot to go through.
**Speaker 3**: I have no idea really what's on that side either.
**Jdawson**: So that's a bunch of.
**Jdawson**: It's.
**Jdawson**: It's quite a bit of drainage.
**Speaker 3**: Well, I know that.
**Speaker 3**: I'm just saying.
**Speaker 3**: I don't know.
**Speaker 3**: I didn't see an easement over there, so I don't think anything's running through there.
**Speaker 3**: I would doubt it is, but with all that drainage, we wouldn't want to put anything in the ground.
**Speaker 3**: You know, that'd be a very, very long board to be expensive.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Thanks.
**Speaker 3**: Guys.
**Speaker 3**: Let me know if you need anything yet.
**Speaker 3**: Oh, go ahead, Steve.
**Bclymer**: Just so I'm, like, making sure that I'm very clear on this PE letter that you gave us.
**Bclymer**: So this is like their feedback to Shane's comments that he provided on the three bullet points of, like, the conduit being on its own, supports, laying on the building steel of other infrastructure, and strapping.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: So we.
**Speaker 3**: We looked up the code, and code states that this conduit can be supported basically every six foot, which we are.
**Speaker 3**: Shane raised the question, oh, is the building strong enough, though, to accept that load?
**Speaker 3**: And so we.
**Speaker 3**: We got the submittals.
**Speaker 3**: I think it was like two pounds per foot.
**Speaker 3**: And after doing our structural review, we've reviewed that whole area.
**Speaker 3**: Right.
**Speaker 3**: For these rpus.
**Speaker 3**: I just wanted to get a structural engineer to sign off and say yes, for what we have installed, there's no issues with the structural integrity of the building.
**Speaker 3**: So everything's installed to code.
**Speaker 3**: Um, and then the letter is just icing on the cake saying the.
**Speaker 3**: The building can handle it after our review.
**Speaker 4**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So, yeah, I mean, I think definitely, like, on.
**Bclymer**: I don't know if you can see my screen.
**Speaker 3**: I can't.
**Speaker 3**: I'm on my phone.
**Speaker 3**: I'm sorry.
**Speaker 3**: I'm outside right now.
**Speaker 3**: I'm in Dallas.
**Speaker 4**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: The only one that I'm a little bit unsure of, of how it was addressed is this third bullet point that says the pieces of wire seen in the picture are not acceptable.
**Bclymer**: According to nac, blah, blah, blah.
**Bclymer**: Feeder raceways must be securely fastened in place, meaning they need to be properly attached to the building structure using appropriate supports and fasteners at regular intervals, typically within 3ft of boxes, cabinets, or other termination points.
**Bclymer**: So that's not really Covered in the letter, but I assume that's covered in the pictures that you said last time.
**Speaker 3**: I sent you a response to those two.
**Speaker 3**: Can you let me here.
**Speaker 3**: I'm gonna stop here and Walking outside while I'm talking to you guys.
**Speaker 3**: Let me try and just stop and pull up my computer, Steve, because I sent you another response with an answer to those two.
**Speaker 3**: So not.
**Bclymer**: Not in this letter.
**Speaker 3**: Not in that letter.
**Speaker 3**: It's referencing the code.
**Speaker 3**: One second.
**Speaker 3**: Back to my phone here.
**Speaker 3**: Sent to Steve Fisher.
**Speaker 3**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay, I got it.
**Bclymer**: I found it.
**Speaker 3**: You pull it up on yours to make sure it's the right one.
**Speaker 3**: Okay.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, yeah.
**Speaker 3**: So there's the two responses in green.
**Speaker 3**: And we have more pictures, too.
**Speaker 3**: Mid south has tidied everything up.
**Speaker 3**: They want it.
**Speaker 3**: And then.
**Speaker 3**: And then the letter is supposed to address his.
**Speaker 3**: His second statement.
**Speaker 4**: Okay.
**Speaker 3**: I feel that's sufficient enough.
**Speaker 3**: You know, talking with Jesse, you know, we felt those two answers were sufficient enough.
**Speaker 3**: Obviously, we had to do a little extra work for.
**Speaker 3**: For his second concern.
**Speaker 3**: That's why I got that letter.
**Speaker 4**: Okay, cool.
**Bclymer**: Sounds good.
**Speaker 3**: And then if he wants.
**Speaker 3**: You know, I think I.
**Speaker 3**: I may have sent you the.
**Speaker 3**: He may ask for a submittal for the aluminum conductor we used.
**Speaker 3**: If he wants that, we can get that for him, too.
**Speaker 3**: I mean, I can't.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, he's obviously just being nitpicky.
**Speaker 3**: If he goes in there and looks at all the existing stuff, ours is pretty clean compared, so.
**Speaker 3**: I know that doesn't matter, but still.
**Speaker 4**: Okay.
**Speaker 3**: We missing anything else from him?
**Speaker 3**: I think those are the last three items, right?
**Jdawson**: For now, yeah.
**Bclymer**: But appreciate it.
**Bclymer**: I'll keep you posted.
**Speaker 3**: Let us know.
**Speaker 3**: We'll keep at trying to keep them happy, so.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Speaker 4**: Sounds good.
**Bclymer**: I'll follow up with you.
**Speaker 3**: So, Steve, do you foresee getting a release anytime soon?
**Bclymer**: I don't know.
**Bclymer**: I think we're.
**Bclymer**: Right now, we're still just wrapped up in a lot of stuff from this audit, and everybody's really focused on just that, first and foremost, for sure.
**Bclymer**: So I think we're close.
**Bclymer**: We got a.
**Bclymer**: We hired a different consultant, and she seems to know what she's actually talking about.
**Bclymer**: I don't know if you.
**Bclymer**: At least.
**Bclymer**: That's how I feel, Eric.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, I.
**Ataylor**: I agree.
**Ataylor**: I was just surprised they changed so quickly.
**Bclymer**: I think there was a lot of frustration because we paid all this money to cgmp and Michael, our head of council, was like.
**Bclymer**: We hired them to help us through this, and, like, it seems like we're still.
**Bclymer**: They didn't help us.
**Bclymer**: Was his feedback.
**Bclymer**: So why are we gonna pay them more money?
**Ataylor**: Yeah, well, I, I We.
**Ataylor**: We weren't going anywhere fast.
**Ataylor**: I definitely had that feeling.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Now I think we're in a much better response.
**Bclymer**: All right, so, yeah, as soon as we know something, A.J.
**Bclymer**: you'll be the first to know.
**Speaker 3**: Yep.
**Speaker 3**: We're ready to rock and roll.
**Speaker 3**: So let me know.
**Bclymer**: Cool.
**Speaker 3**: Alrighty, guys.
**Speaker 3**: See you next week.
**Jdawson**: Later.
