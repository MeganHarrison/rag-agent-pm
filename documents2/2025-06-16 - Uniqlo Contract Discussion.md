## Transcript
**Bclymer**: Gotcha.
**Jdawson**: All right, so I got your notes.
**Jdawson**: So the PDF, so I understand it, the PDF has got your comments on it.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So the PDF is the red line that I ran against what you sent me with your comments.
**Bclymer**: So I made changes, incorporated your comments, and then added some of my own comments and revisions.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: All right, so I sent you the clean version and then I sent you the one that had my markups.
**Jdawson**: And then this PDF is your markups.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so if we go down through this.
**Jdawson**: All right, so no owner attachment, relevant sections of lease as an exhibit, that's you, correct?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so we've got that.
**Jdawson**: Now the, basically the biggest thing on there, the argument that we're having is the insurance stuff, which I'm getting just a specific policy that they're going to pay for to cover that.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Other than that, it's nothing crazy.
**Bclymer**: Gotcha.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so the schedule.
**Jdawson**: So when we started this project, because we're working off an lli, so I'll.
**Jdawson**: Let me shoot you the LOI that's signed real quick that released this on it.
**Jdawson**: If I, if I put this in the, if I put this in the chat.
**Jdawson**: Can you.
**Jdawson**: Are you able to see that?
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: All right, so there's the oi.
**Jdawson**: So basically that schedule is written in here and I don't want to change it because that's what we agreed to.
**Jdawson**: The fact that we've been going back and forth on this contract don't, you know, whatever.
**Jdawson**: And my thought is, because they're standing hard on, we have to have some sort of liquidated damages.
**Jdawson**: So it's like, okay, we've already missed dates on that schedule that are not our fault.
**Jdawson**: So we'll execute this and then I'm going to give them a delay notice the next day just so I can absolve fault, essentially.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Bclymer**: That was my concern about the schedule meeting updated just because, you know, we're obviously past the start date and then you're automatically in default.
**Jdawson**: Well, yeah, we're, we're.
**Jdawson**: Because we, we just now got the permit approved.
**Jdawson**: Now we had said that it's two weeks from permit approval is when we start is what I have put out there.
**Jdawson**: And so we went ahead, they were like, they wanted us out there, whatever, fine.
**Jdawson**: We would have started, put the fence in whatnot.
**Jdawson**: And so again, I'm going to be like, hey, guys, day one, we were supposed to have the, the permit by this date that you made me put on the schedule that I told you wasn't going to happen.
**Jdawson**: So now we're delayed Whatever, four weeks.
**Jdawson**: And it just buys me more time.
**Jdawson**: But even then, and what I've told these guys is the largest part of this contract is Exotech, which is the racking system, which is going directly with the owner, not underneath our purview.
**Jdawson**: So, I mean, we can't do anything unless their shit's put in.
**Jdawson**: Like, you know, the way that they've got this.
**Jdawson**: Look at this written is for, like a retail store.
**Jdawson**: It's like, that's not gonna work.
**Jdawson**: We don't have.
**Jdawson**: Half this shit's not underneath us.
**Jdawson**: So our thought in.
**Jdawson**: Is, in my understanding to liquidated damages is as soon as.
**Jdawson**: If they don't go after the first person that, you know, doesn't hit a date on the schedule, then it essentially absolves everything down the line.
**Jdawson**: They can't just pick and choose.
**Bclymer**: I need to look at that again, get into it.
**Jdawson**: I'm not saying, like in their contract.
**Jdawson**: I'm just saying in general case law, you know, you can't if.
**Jdawson**: If your framer misses his dates and he's delayed, but then you fast forward six months later, now your H Vac guy is delayed.
**Jdawson**: You know, you can't just be.
**Jdawson**: All right, well, I'm putting you on notice and go after the H Vac guy for liquidated damages unless you went after everybody in front of him first, right?
**Bclymer**: So it depends if they're like.
**Bclymer**: If they're H Vac guys under you or not.
**Jdawson**: So I'm just saying liquidated damages.
**Jdawson**: Let's say that everybody's underneath one contract, right?
**Jdawson**: If.
**Jdawson**: If I didn't go after the first guy that missed a date, you know, I can't sit here and go after the guy later in the project without going after everybody in front, Right?
**Jdawson**: Is that.
**Jdawson**: Is that how you see it as well?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So they.
**Bclymer**: They would have to go claim the liquidated damages from the party that's responsible for the delay, essentially.
**Bclymer**: So if there's a guy in front of you that you're waiting on, you know, it's not your responsibility that it's delayed.
**Bclymer**: And so they can't get liquidated damages because you're a week late.
**Bclymer**: Because the guy in front of you is a week late.
**Jdawson**: I get that.
**Jdawson**: What I'm saying is like, for instance, again, like, let's say that one.
**Jdawson**: One contractor misses a date, right?
**Jdawson**: They're supposed to start on the 12th, and they didn't start till the 22nd early on in the project.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And even if it doesn't affect me later, right?
**Jdawson**: Let's say that Everything adjusts.
**Jdawson**: And then I was originally supposed to start on the 20th of, you know, November, you know, four months later.
**Jdawson**: Now I'm starting on the 1st of December.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: No big deal.
**Jdawson**: But then let's.
**Jdawson**: Like, they can't actually go after that guy unless they would have went over the first guy that missed, even though the durations shift.
**Jdawson**: Right, right.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: And then so you marked out, or I guess Somebody marked April 3, 2020.
**Jdawson**: So, like Article 2, the contractor will commence construction.
**Jdawson**: So I said two weeks after permit approval from the HJ.
**Jdawson**: They just wrote Authority 7 jurisdiction.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So that was my revision.
**Bclymer**: You had commented two weeks after.
**Bclymer**: And so I.
**Bclymer**: All I did was build that in there.
**Jdawson**: Okay, perfect.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so the blue is.
**Jdawson**: Is you.
**Jdawson**: Right?
**Bclymer**: The blue is my revisions, the red is my deletions.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: Contract sperm.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Boom, boom, boom.
**Jdawson**: All right, so you basically just covered us in the.
**Jdawson**: In the periodicle 7.
**Speaker 2**: Are you sharing this as you go through it, Brandon?
**Jdawson**: Oh, I can actually.
**Jdawson**: It says I can't share.
**Jdawson**: Can you change that, Logan?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: This is our COO Logan, by the way.
**Bclymer**: Hey, good to meet you.
**Bclymer**: How you doing?
**Jdawson**: Good, good.
**Bclymer**: Should be good now.
**Jdawson**: All right, so you.
**Jdawson**: So you added that language.
**Jdawson**: Did I have in there?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And four, one, one.
**Bclymer**: It was just.
**Bclymer**: They had way too much discretion with.
**Bclymer**: No, really, like.
**Bclymer**: Like milestones essentially, to like, make sure that you're getting paid.
**Jdawson**: Right, right.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I mean, that's so.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I think I thought I put in there like 30 days or something like that, didn't I?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I think there is a 30 days.
**Bclymer**: I think that's down further.
**Bclymer**: I believe in the.
**Bclymer**: In four, two, maybe.
**Jdawson**: Okay, gotcha.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So like our sale.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, because I marked some of that out.
**Jdawson**: Because our sales, I mean, we don't separate that out.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: 25th.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So you just put that in there, then you added this, right?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, So I think I took that from a comment that was there.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So it looks like right here, basically.
**Jdawson**: Isn't that pretty much saying the same thing?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So do we need to delete this?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I think so.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: Do you want to put a note on there to delete that so we're not duplicating.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Progress payments.
**Bclymer**: Sony retainage.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, 10% is fine.
**Jdawson**: So there's no change there.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So this is final payment accepted by industry standards.
**Speaker 2**: Boom.
**Bclymer**: This part I was a little confused on.
**Bclymer**: On the back and forth you guys were having about who's providing what, like the sprinkler drawings, the original Air balance report as built drawings.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, so.
**Jdawson**: So, yeah, so there is no tmb.
**Jdawson**: So I marked that out, you know, as far as as builds, I said field drawings because they.
**Jdawson**: They.
**Jdawson**: They're doing the design.
**Jdawson**: Like, I'm not giving.
**Jdawson**: I'm not going to redraw everything.
**Jdawson**: I'll give them field drawings, which are just marked up.
**Jdawson**: Field drawings, which I think those are the only things.
**Jdawson**: And then, like, like, see, like this affidavit and like that.
**Jdawson**: That's the stuff where I was like, this is covered in lien waivers.
**Jdawson**: Like, we don't need to reinvent the wheel here.
**Jdawson**: Like, they asked for us to.
**Jdawson**: To put three different things, and we paid people.
**Bclymer**: So you want to take like 513-518- out.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I want it to be a standard.
**Jdawson**: Like, all right, like, you know, it's.
**Jdawson**: Here's your.
**Jdawson**: Here's your pay app with your conditional lien waiver.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Oh, you've paid us.
**Jdawson**: Here's your unconditional lien waiver.
**Jdawson**: Like standard billing practices.
**Jdawson**: Not all this affidavit certified this, certified that.
**Jdawson**: Like, no, guys, this is.
**Jdawson**: That's ridiculous.
**Jdawson**: Take that out country knowledge.
**Bclymer**: And I think you had a modified version here for this.
**Bclymer**: And I just plugged that in.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So, okay, so this is the liquidated damages.
**Jdawson**: Cause do we have a cap on this.
**Bclymer**: 10%?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that's what I thought.
**Jdawson**: Okay, perfect.
**Jdawson**: Insurance contractor show purchase with its own funds.
**Bclymer**: So this is where this just kind of goes back to say, hey, like, you have the lease.
**Bclymer**: You're responsible for incorporating the terms that are relevant.
**Bclymer**: Like, you shouldn't have to go through and figure that out, because then you get into a dispute about what you need to comply with and what you don't.
**Bclymer**: And so going back to them, including those provisions as a schedule, this kind of just cleans up this saying that, like, you're not responsible for looking through the lease.
**Jdawson**: Perfect.
**Jdawson**: I like that.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Which we're pulling out as a special builder's risk anyway for whatever we don't have.
**Jdawson**: They said they'd pay for it.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So yeah, this is all just basically protecting our ass, right?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So, like, you can't provide insurance for people you don't know about.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: So they need to give you a list of people that you need to be insuring as additional insureds.
**Bclymer**: So that way, like, you know, if something does happen, they say, oh, you know, you were supposed to insure this party.
**Bclymer**: You know, you're in breach of the contract.
**Jdawson**: Gotcha.
**Jdawson**: So this is basically just taking this and putting it up here, I take it?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And I added some terms here just to like make the change orders a little more detailed because it was missing, you know, some standard language about procedures and how to go about it.
**Jdawson**: Like what?
**Bclymer**: So you had.
**Bclymer**: Think it's not showing here.
**Bclymer**: I think like 4, 6, I believe, or I mean 7 6.
**Bclymer**: Sorry.
**Jdawson**: What about 7, 6.
**Bclymer**: So just adding in the force majeure event essentially, you know, making that such that it's a guaranteed change order.
**Bclymer**: So that way there's no dispute about, you know, whether or not you're entitled to additional time.
**Jdawson**: Gotcha.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Just assigning shit.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, that's important for, you know, let's.
**Jdawson**: Say.
**Bclymer**: You go to sell the company or somebody wants to invest.
**Bclymer**: Like this basically just allows you to do that without having to get their approval to take those actions.
**Jdawson**: Gotcha.
**Speaker 2**: He's selling us out.
**Speaker 2**: Brandon, what's happening?
**Jdawson**: Pretty much typical of Tony, the event of any conflict or excuse, the terms and conditions of this agreement show control over.
**Jdawson**: Okay, perfect.
**Bclymer**: That's just standard waiver jury trial mutual attorneys fees clause.
**Speaker 2**: Does that take out.
**Speaker 2**: I think they had a line in there that said we'd have to pay their attorney fees even if it was their fault that their employees and their problem.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, now it's, now it's mutual.
**Jdawson**: So he's saying, so we pay ours, they pay theirs.
**Jdawson**: Right, Logan?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So two, three, two.
**Bclymer**: There were some comments in there about essentially what's governed by other sections in the agreement.
**Bclymer**: And so I just said, you know, subject to the contract documents, which basically refers you to the agreement and the additional terms.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, so that's our.
**Jdawson**: I, I made comment that our, our construction documents are our scope of work.
**Jdawson**: You see in our loi.
**Jdawson**: Like because their, their drawings, they did multiple iterations that are inconsistent.
**Jdawson**: It's like, hey guys, this scope of work, these clarifications and this, you know, schedule values, this is what is the contract documents.
**Jdawson**: Like, this is it.
**Jdawson**: This is what we got.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: The warranty period.
**Bclymer**: So I wasn't sure about your warranty.
**Bclymer**: I hadn't seen the loi, but I plugged that in because that's like a pretty standard warranty time that.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Most of my clients will plug in.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, one year.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Because as it was written, it was basically like an unlimited warranty.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: For the insurance.
**Speaker 2**: Are we, are they going to have us pay to keep it for three years after we're done?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we're going to do a builder's risk policy for it.
**Jdawson**: We're not going to do our.
**Jdawson**: We're going to do a specific.
**Jdawson**: So the.
**Jdawson**: Our insurance guy, I got to meet with him this afternoon.
**Jdawson**: Hey, give me a policy specifically for this job that meets this criteria.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Make sure he reviews the terms of all the insurance provisions.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: So this is.
**Jdawson**: What is this?
**Bclymer**: It's similar to what's above, just a little more detailed.
**Bclymer**: Just saying, breaking down the limited warranty, explaining that it's a limited warranty, just limiting your obligations.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 2**: Does that say we'll respond to a warranty in five days?
**Bclymer**: Five business days.
**Speaker 2**: Make the repairs in five days?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I think there was a comment in there about that being okay, but, you know, if that needs to be longer, that's fine.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Can we change that to like, something like this says, like, reasonable, like.
**Jdawson**: Because obviously, like, if we have.
**Jdawson**: If there's an issue and we can't get the material or something like that, then I don't want to be on the hook.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: Like a transformer goes out.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Bclymer**: So I think commence there is basically that like you're commencing repairs by ordering the materials.
**Bclymer**: But, you know, we can change it to make it a little bit more flexible.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, let's.
**Jdawson**: Let's change that if we can.
**Jdawson**: Omitted.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So that the payment terms were.
**Bclymer**: I basically detailed them out more and that.
**Bclymer**: And included in the agreement.
**Bclymer**: And having them here just creates the potential for inconsistencies and confusion.
**Jdawson**: Gotcha.
**Bclymer**: Same with the change orders.
**Jdawson**: Article 11.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: 15, one omitted.
**Bclymer**: I think you had some changes here and then I included them.
**Jdawson**: Gotcha.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so you just.
**Jdawson**: We already cover that, I take it.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And then I added that definition for substantial completion.
**Bclymer**: It's a pretty GC friendly provision, but it just basically gives them less discretion to determine whether or not substantial completion has occurred.
**Bclymer**: But you just need to, like, read through that and make sure that those bullets match up to, you know, what substantial completion means to you guys.
**Speaker 2**: I mean, they can like, substantially complete if we don't have the owner's manuals all to them.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, I don't know about that because sometimes those take a month to get from our subs.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So take that out.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And I would say, like, so, like, you know, because.
**Jdawson**: I would say like, substantial completion is, you know, because this is unique.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Because we're going to be done with our scope of work and.
**Jdawson**: And exotech is still doing stuff like we're going to be done in like, May, but they're not gonna turn this thing on and get final inspection until like, August.
**Jdawson**: So I would put something on.
**Jdawson**: Their substantial completion is, you know, like you know, completion inspection of our scope of work.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Contractor scope of work, Sam.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: Indemnification.
**Jdawson**: This is their shitty ass clause.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, that's bad.
**Jdawson**: So you basically rewrote it to where it's fair.
**Jdawson**: That's what I try to do.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, essentially.
**Jdawson**: Did you any.
**Jdawson**: That I wrote crazy or did you basically encompass that or what?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I.
**Bclymer**: I try to just incorporate what you had in your goals.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I mean, the biggest.
**Bclymer**: So it's basically.
**Bclymer**: I think that's pretty standard to have proportionate share, you know, because that would be crazy otherwise.
**Jdawson**: Exactly.
**Jdawson**: That's like.
**Jdawson**: That was my.
**Jdawson**: And I sort.
**Jdawson**: I told their cfo, I said, look, if we can't come to terms on this indemnification, I'll walk away.
**Jdawson**: I was like, right now this says that if one of your guys falls and we're not even on site where we're at fault, I was like, I'm not gonna sink my company.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: No, that's nonsense.
**Jdawson**: So this is basically it.
**Jdawson**: This is basically this 25.2 and 0.3 is the indemnification.
**Jdawson**: So you shortened it up, essentially.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And then put a cap on it, basically saying that it's your caps.
**Bclymer**: They.
**Bclymer**: They'll probably push back on it.
**Bclymer**: But I capped it on your insurance coverage.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: What's this?
**Bclymer**: Which one?
**Jdawson**: 26 6.
**Bclymer**: That's just about like labor disputes.
**Bclymer**: I try to omit those just because you can't really control a lot of that.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, that's just like something that should be standard in the agreement that you like.
**Bclymer**: You.
**Bclymer**: Labor disputes are a force majeure event.
**Jdawson**: Gotcha.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I mean, looks.
**Jdawson**: Looks pretty good.
**Jdawson**: Do you want to.
**Jdawson**: If you can make those adjustments in there and then I don't know if it.
**Jdawson**: If it's, you know, maybe a good idea to.
**Jdawson**: You can go into that word doc and print it without, you know.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Can you set.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: What I could do is, you know, take my comments out, but then can you send me their version?
**Bclymer**: I'm guessing they sent you a clean version without comments, and then I can just redline against their version.
**Jdawson**: The email I sent you had the original.
**Jdawson**: Do you know.
**Jdawson**: Do you see that?
**Jdawson**: I sent it had.
**Jdawson**: Had three attachments.
**Bclymer**: Yep, I got it.
**Jdawson**: So that's.
**Jdawson**: That's the original clean version they sent.
**Jdawson**: And then I sent you my comments.
**Jdawson**: And then I also sent you the email where they were coming back on.
**Jdawson**: On the comments.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And so there wasn't like back and forth changes after that, just that last.
**Jdawson**: Email I sent you where?
**Jdawson**: Where, like, so I sent my comments and they came back saying, blah, blah, blah.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, okay, perfect.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, so I can make those changes real quick, run the red line and get it back to you and go from there.
**Jdawson**: All right, perfect.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I think should be.
**Jdawson**: Should be it.
**Jdawson**: So, yeah, shoot that over and go from there.
**Bclymer**: Sounds good.
**Jdawson**: Awesome.
**Jdawson**: Thanks, man.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, see you guys.
