**Gducharme**: We spoke to the city today and they gave us the names of a couple people that we need to contact.
**Bclymer**: Do you guys need me to go down there?
**Bclymer**: Jesse or Nick?
**Kmass**: Where?
**Kmass**: Who's just calling?
**Kmass**: This other guy.
**Kmass**: This lady now says we need to get a striping permit.
**Kmass**: Jesus.
**Kmass**: So this a guy named Cameron who's just Trying to call him and it may be you need to make a trip down there.
**Kmass**: Seeing face to face.
**Bclymer**: Just let me know.
**Bclymer**: Just let me know.
**Kmass**: Okay?
**Kmass**: Right.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Glenn.
**Ataylor**: Westfield Collective.
**Njepson**: Westfield Collective got Footers foundation started last week.
**Njepson**: I'm expecting Center Point to be done with their encroachment review and have an agreement to us by the end of this week.
**Njepson**: I am trying to get the deed paperwork for them to finish that up as well as new service is ready to go once we are ready to go with this encroachment.
**Njepson**: We have foundations and underground site, electrician site electric going on this week and I have bids due for the remaining scopes that need bought out on Friday and only some people got them in.
**Njepson**: So we're calling and asking for the rest of this pricing to come in.
**Njepson**: I need countertops, tile doors, painting, sound insulation and the bathroom stuff.
**Njepson**: Other than that, I have some other items ready to buy out for superior final cleaning.
**Njepson**: And then we're working on wrapping up the final pricing for the kitchens.
**Ataylor**: For.
**Njepson**: The changeover change order for the kitchens.
**Njepson**: Waiting on the tile for that.
**Njepson**: I think that's the last thing I'm waiting on is the decision on where tile and stainless steel goes in each of the five kitchens.
**Njepson**: That's about it.
**Kmass**: Is that like the design drawings, they're done.
**Kmass**: They still just have these questions that need answered.
**Njepson**: What do you mean?
**Kmass**: You said tile in the kitchens.
**Njepson**: Yeah, yeah.
**Njepson**: So Eli said that the kitchens will be tile.
**Njepson**: However, the wall behind the hood may require it to be stainless steel for sanitary reasons.
**Kmass**: For fire reasons needs to be stainless.
**Kmass**: So that's.
**Kmass**: You just need to figure it is stainless.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: He, he said let's see, tile on all four walls everywhere else.
**Njepson**: But we may have to put stainless under the hood based on local food and safety code.
**Njepson**: So as soon as he answers me that then I can have them finish out their tile pricing or update their tile pricing.
**Njepson**: But I, I got pricing back from Superior from Midwest and from JL just got me their number here a little bit ago.
**Kmass**: So.
**Njepson**: I think, I think that's it for the interior guys.
**Njepson**: I don't have Glenmarks not bidding on it and Morningside never got back with me.
**Njepson**: So I have three painting companies.
**Njepson**: JL did bid painting, but I have three other painting companies finishing up their numbers for me.
**Njepson**: I got two companies doing the counter and bar tops.
**Njepson**: Got two companies getting me pricing for that spray foam insulation spray or I'm sorry, soundproofing spray foam that we discussed this morning under the mezzanine.
**Njepson**: Andrew got pricing back from fight for those RTUs.
**Njepson**: Oh, no, I have another.
**Njepson**: I have another interior guy that Chad found too, for.
**Njepson**: So I have one more bid that I'm waiting for for interiors finish out buyout for them.
**Njepson**: We are looking at moving or removing some of the doors and then in the OAC tomorrow.
**Njepson**: Eli, give me a heads up that Mike had talked to him about adding another overhead door and possibly some windows in the arcade area.
**Njepson**: So we'll get all that stuff captured on this next next round of subcontract.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: I see here that it says drying the title bond.
**Ataylor**: Is June 10th still the due date?
**Ataylor**: Should we change it?
**Ataylor**: To what date, Glenn?
**Njepson**: No, that.
**Njepson**: I mean it's.
**Njepson**: It's already done.
**Njepson**: I'm waiting for them.
**Njepson**: But that.
**Njepson**: My part.
**Njepson**: My part is done.
**Njepson**: They need to release.
**Njepson**: They just need to release the bond.
**Njepson**: But they had everything they did by the due date.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Other than that.
**Ataylor**: This is interesting also.
**Ataylor**: This is also the same.
**Njepson**: Which one?
**Ataylor**: LE Master CEO.
**Njepson**: Yeah, Le Master needs to get me their pricing too.
**Njepson**: I needed that.
**Njepson**: I asked him to have that ready for me on Friday, but he didn't.
**Njepson**: He just got back from vacation.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Thank you, Lane.
**Ataylor**: Cormac.
**Ataylor**: Yep.
**Kmass**: Sorry.
**Njepson**: Jesse, you remember about the Lee Master having money or a change order forthcoming for like the slab edge metal and a couple other things that we didn't have finalized by the time we had to write him a contract and give him that deposit.
**Kmass**: How much is it?
**Njepson**: I don't.
**Njepson**: I don't have.
**Njepson**: I don't have anything from him yet.
**Njepson**: That's what I've been asking him for.
**Njepson**: He said he's working on it.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Cormagia Exetect.
**Ataylor**: This is Brandon.
**Ataylor**: So final payment.
**Jdawson**: I think we're still waiting on final payment.
**Njepson**: I think it's been billed.
**Ataylor**: Expire.
**Ataylor**: Son.
**Ataylor**: Lucy, Nick.
**Gducharme**: Final payment.
**Kmass**: I messaged Ronnie last week.
**Kmass**: He said when he got back from his.
**Kmass**: He's some conference he's at, so if I don't hear from end of today, I'll shoot him another message or call him up and see what's going on with their payment.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: AJ Neiman Holding, FedEx.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, we're just waiting on a.
**Bclymer**: Waiting on a permit at this point.
**Bclymer**: We.
**Bclymer**: We started a little early running conduits today because the guys were looking for stuff to do.
**Bclymer**: So I told them they could run conduits as long as they stay inside.
**Bclymer**: And we're all bought out.
**Bclymer**: So it's just a matter of getting that permit and then we'll start cutting openings.
**Ataylor**: Then.
**Ataylor**: Bill Theater.
**Bclymer**: Yep, I spoke with.
**Bclymer**: Spoke with Bill On Friday.
**Bclymer**: And he was like, well, let's at least get started on what we have under contract.

**Bclymer**: Andres is going to go out there on Thursday and get going on paintings.
**Bclymer**: So I need to get everything entered in job planner for that.

**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: Nothing has changed.
**Kmass**: Correct.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Seminole Collective, this is Jesse.
**Kmass**: Nothing new on that this week.
**Kmass**: I think we still need the city.
**Kmass**: Like, we haven't got them.
**Kmass**: We haven't got anything back on that additional land yet that I know of, my friend.
**Kmass**: And you've heard anything from it?
**Jdawson**: No.
**Jdawson**: Mike's getting with the city about the other.
**Jdawson**: Other land.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Brandon.
**Ataylor**: Poor Collective.
**Jdawson**: We've got an OI from the city.
**Jdawson**: So now we've got to get.
**Jdawson**: To get moving on design.
**Jdawson**: So we should have a design meeting tomorrow.
**Kmass**: You said design.
**Kmass**: That's your meeting with them on that?
**Jdawson**: No, you said Justin was.
**Kmass**: Oh, yeah, I got a meeting with Justin.
**Kmass**: Yeah.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Goodwill Trement.
**Gducharme**: Nick, I.
**Gducharme**: I think Brandon and Jesse were going to talk with Goodwill about the pricing.
**Gducharme**: I'm not sure if you guys did that.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I need to talk to Jared again.
**Jdawson**: Do we have the.
**Jdawson**: We have the.
**Jdawson**: The final cleaned up version?
**Kmass**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: All right, let me.
**Jdawson**: Let's get in there and look at it.
**Kmass**: But Brandon, on the.
**Kmass**: Before the meeting with Justin, did they have a list of the Micro Hotel or whatever hotels they're looking at so that we can give that to Justin?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, the main one is.
**Jdawson**: Is the Hard Rocks Signature Hotel, which.
**Ataylor**: Is.
**Jdawson**: Reverb R E V E R B Reverb.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Yep.
**Kmass**: We'll just use that.
**Kmass**: All right.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Keva Uniqlo, New Jersey.
**Fireflies**: Yes.
**Fireflies**: So we are picking up permits tomorrow.
**Fireflies**: Mike is picking it up tomorrow morning.
**Fireflies**: And for electrical work, we are starting on the 18th.
**Fireflies**: That's Wednesday.
**Fireflies**: So we are combining on our schedule.
**Fireflies**: We have them working for six days for part B and then coming back another week.
**Fireflies**: But I was able to confirm with Yuzuki, so we will be able to combine those two.
**Fireflies**: And we are relocating the lives on.
**Fireflies**: On plan B and then plan A.
**Fireflies**: So they will do that in one shot starting on Wednesday.
**Fireflies**: Would probably take them about 10 days to be done with that.
**Fireflies**: And then they have finalized drawings for the electrical change.
**Fireflies**: So Dean is working on pricing that for us and we should get pricing by Wednesday.
**Fireflies**: So we can, I guess, discuss that on the weekly meeting.
**Fireflies**: The flow Remediation is also getting done by Wednesday.
**Fireflies**: They're finishing up this week and I think that's it for now.
**Fireflies**: Project.
**Fireflies**: We have all of our submittals approved except for the electrical because they are making changes.
**Fireflies**: So deem is working on submitting that as well.
**Fireflies**: We will get that done this week too.
**Kmass**: Yeah, but put yourself an activity to write a get a change order because our allowance, we went over by a little bit on that permit cost.
**Kmass**: If you look at our proposal, we had 10,000 in there and it was 10:5 or something.
**Fireflies**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: I see some things here, Keva, that says still in progress.
**Ataylor**: Correct pricing for electrical changes in progress.
**Ataylor**: June 11 request response from subs on addendum still June 11.
**Fireflies**: You can change that to change it to the 18th for that.
**Ataylor**: June 18.
**Ataylor**: Both correct.
**Fireflies**: Actually.
**Fireflies**: The first one, the request response, that is done.
**Ataylor**: Okay, that's perfect.
**Ataylor**: And then this is June 18th.
**Ataylor**: So once again, June 18th.
**Ataylor**: And then this was June one.
**Ataylor**: Okay, perfect.
**Ataylor**: Thank you, Keva.
**Ataylor**: AJ Memphis call storage phase two.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So I sent some emails out to a few of the guys for getting their updated proposals.
**Bclymer**: I.
**Bclymer**: I haven't followed up with them.
**Bclymer**: I will do that.
**Bclymer**: Other than that, have we heard anything from Steve, Jesse or Brandon?
**Kmass**: I haven't heard anything.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Nothing.
**Bclymer**: Well, feels good to have that license so now we can just rip and roar.
**Bclymer**: So I haven't been spending too much time on it, but I'll make it a focus here.
**Bclymer**: Probably end of the week, early next week.
**Ataylor**: Okay, thank you, AJ Goodwill foundations.
**Ataylor**: Glenn.
**Fireflies**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: We started last week with demo and got all the demo done, got all the framing completed and the plumbing wrapped up today we had to do a change.
**Njepson**: We're gonna have to do a change order for JL to patch into all of the outlets on the exterior walls as well as Jesse.
**Njepson**: When they reshaped the bathrooms, the act tile no longer fit in the ceilings with the new shape of the bathroom.
**Njepson**: So we gotta drop a new ceiling in there.
**Njepson**: How do you want to handle that change order wise?
**Njepson**: Should I take that to the owner or just us?
**Kmass**: Gonna have to on that one ceiling.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Kmass**: Was there any contingency in the budget?
**Kmass**: So assume not.
**Kmass**: Yeah, we have none.
**Kmass**: What is the outlet change?
**Kmass**: Was that something where they requested additional outlets?
**Njepson**: No, it's because the outlet boxes that they have are too deep and the brick wall.
**Njepson**: There's brick and the walls are furred out.
**Njepson**: So what they have is.
**Njepson**: They have like a.
**Njepson**: They have a four way box or a four way box in there and then it's thinner.
**Njepson**: So the wires can fit in there.
**Njepson**: And then you put a mud plate, a mud ring on the outside.
**Njepson**: So it goes from four into or, you know, two wide into one wide.
**Njepson**: So it just is still a regular, you know, outlet with just two plugs.
**Kmass**: We'll just put it together before you send, you know, make a change event, and I'll just.
**Kmass**: I'll call Andrew before you send it.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Njepson**: See, Dean has a question about the design intent for the can lights.
**Njepson**: We called for recessed can lights, but obviously there's no ceiling, so they can mount flush to there.
**Njepson**: But, Jesse, did you have something in mind, like a can light that had a housing on it, so you couldn't, you know, see the exposed, you know, wires or whatever type of can light that's recessed up there, you know, is hidden up in the ceiling?
**Njepson**: Normally.
**Kmass**: No, they have to be a can light.
**Kmass**: I mean, Dean's got to find a can light that.
**Kmass**: I'll check with Andrew.
**Kmass**: He mentioned a certain type, but, you know, it's going to be exposed.
**Kmass**: So it's.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Kmass**: Look like.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: Was your intention to just mount it to the side of a joist or put a strut across the joist and mount to that?
**Kmass**: Can lights come with the little cleats, hangers that span the.
**Kmass**: The joist and just nail in there.
**Kmass**: So they'll just use a typical can light support.
**Kmass**: I don't know.
**Kmass**: They'll have to send us some options.
**Kmass**: Just ask them to give us options of different can lights.
**Kmass**: We'll get them over to Goodwill and then we'll see what they think of them.
**Kmass**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: That is.
**Njepson**: That's all I have going on for.
**Njepson**: For Goodwill.
**Njepson**: We've made.
**Njepson**: Made a lot of progress in the first week there, so thank you.
**Kmass**: Did you send out a report last week for that?
**Njepson**: I did, yeah.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Njepson**: On Friday, framing inspection is Wednesday by.
**Njepson**: By noon, maybe tomorrow.
**Njepson**: And then we can start closing up drywall.
**Njepson**: Hopefully Dean will be done by next week.
**Ataylor**: Thank you, Glenn.
**Ataylor**: Radio Martins, Martinsville, Keva.
**Fireflies**: We have sent some pricing to JB and we are reviewing that tomorrow with him and the submittal process.
**Fireflies**: I'm going to start tomorrow.
**Fireflies**: The scope list, I think at this point is updated until.
**Fireflies**: Unless we get more from JP.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, we'll find out more tomorrow.
**Bclymer**: Kevin, I wouldn't worry too much about the submittals.
**Bclymer**: At this point.
**Bclymer**: We don't even have.
**Bclymer**: We don't.
**Bclymer**: We don't even know what.
**Bclymer**: What that's going to look like as far as movement forwards.
**Fireflies**: Right.
**Fireflies**: Yeah.
**Fireflies**: I think at this point it sounds like I mean whether we are going with wood or metal framing and also whatever we are installing for electric.
**Fireflies**: But I guess after we discuss with him, we'll find out more.
**Kmass**: Yep.
**Fireflies**: I'm still working on adding the budget, pricing and subcontracts on job planner and we haven't really started the plan permitting status permitting process yet.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Something else or this is still.
**Ataylor**: Oh yeah.
**Ataylor**: So that you change everything.
**Ataylor**: Thank you.
**Ataylor**: Keva Coramdel, this is aj Yep.
**Bclymer**: So we're still in talks with.
**Bclymer**: We're still in talks with.
**Bclymer**: With the city right now we're having issues with the owner signing the right of way documents.
**Bclymer**: So I had an email earlier today on that.
**Bclymer**: So not.
**Bclymer**: Not really sure right now their legal department's talking with them.
**Bclymer**: So we'll.
**Bclymer**: We'll see here soon if we can get the.
**Bclymer**: The go ahead to stake it and start moving forward.
**Bclymer**: We got to have it done by August 1st.
**Bclymer**: So we'll see.
**Ataylor**: Thank you.
**Ataylor**: AJ Radial.
**Ataylor**: Evan, this is Kevat.
**Fireflies**: Yes, we had electric.
**Fireflies**: We had dim on site last week for one day and they're going back tomorrow.
**Fireflies**: Go ahead.
**Bclymer**: Kevin, did you see that email about the manpower schedule I sent out?
**Fireflies**: I did, yes.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: I spoke with Brennan and he know, you know, once we get this rolling, he knows to start calling you right here.
**Fireflies**: Okay, good.
**Bclymer**: I'm lighting a fire under him just to get the guys out there and I'm going to be out there tomorrow just to show bodies.
**Bclymer**: And then we have Canon flying in.
**Fireflies**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So he'll be able to handle stuff on site and then you and him can work through once we get the project rolling.
**Fireflies**: Yes.
**Fireflies**: For pricing we're.
**Fireflies**: We just sent JP the redesigned Verm platform today and we are pricing that as along with the guardrails and fencing that we are putting in.
**Fireflies**: The subcontractor for the doctors was out there today and they are mobilizing on the 23rd Monday and we have started the permitting process for the project and schedule.
**Jdawson**: Like an actual Microsoft project schedule.
**Fireflies**: We do have a schedule, Yes.
**Fireflies**: I mean it's still.
**Fireflies**: Still working progress.
**Bclymer**: But it's a schedule, Brandon.
**Bclymer**: I'm looking at it right now.
**Jdawson**: Is it up to date?
**Jdawson**: Like do I.
**Jdawson**: What are we waiting on to where we to build it?
**Ataylor**: I just.
**Bclymer**: I just got to look through it.
**Bclymer**: I was focused on getting the proposal out and then we'll put our heads together and we'll get something to them.
**Bclymer**: So I sent him that manpower schedule to buy us a little time.
**Fireflies**: And this one is still, is also still working on putting the budget and subcontracts and job planner.
**Jdawson**: Well, we just sent him the updated number today.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Kmass**: They approve your design on the platform?
**Fireflies**: He hasn't said anything, but he said he'll get back to us tomorrow because I think they have a 4:30 meeting today and then I did it based on the comments he had on the previous one.
**Jdawson**: They're going to want to know like, you know, the weight capacity and you know, how many people can be on it and all that kind of stuff.
**Jdawson**: Do we have that information?
**Fireflies**: No.
**Jdawson**: We need to get that because right now like if they, you know, put 10 people on there, it could collapse.
**Jdawson**: Like we need to, you know, tell them what this is designed to, you know.
**Jdawson**: So I don't know if that's something you need to get with the, you know, DKGR to look at or what, but we need to make sure that we're.
**Jdawson**: We understand what that is.
**Fireflies**: Okay.
**Fireflies**: Yeah, I can, I can talk to Jerome or Brian tomorrow morning and I'll give him access to the file so we can determine that.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Thank you, Kevin.
**Ataylor**: Sign Arkansas permit.
**Ataylor**: This is Jesse.
**Kmass**: That's done.
**Kmass**: I think the billing Andrew completed.
**Kmass**: Brandon, are you okay with the amount he put in there?
**Kmass**: It was like 42,000.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I mean is that double what we have in it or something?
**Jdawson**: I'm sure.
**Kmass**: Well, I haven't added up all this time yet, but should be.
**Jdawson**: That's my call.
**Kmass**: We just send that over to.
**Jdawson**: Jen.
**Kmass**: Is it Jen?
**Kmass**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: I mean are we sure we've got all the, like, you know, there's no more costs coming our way like.
**Njepson**: No.
**Kmass**: And we paid a deposit that we get back after we finished the permit.
**Kmass**: So it was like a thousand bucks was the fee for.
**Kmass**: I don't know, it's like they just hold on to that money until you close a permit.
**Kmass**: Okay, so we didn't put that in there but we get the money back.
**Ataylor**: Okay, so what's the other task, Jesse?
**Ataylor**: Just to.
**Ataylor**: Well, you send the bill but you want.
**Ataylor**: You have to follow up on something with the price.
**Kmass**: No, I would just put a.
**Kmass**: You can put a thing in there to just get refund at end of project for permit bond.
**Ataylor**: If the get refund.
**Kmass**: Yes.

**Kmass**: We got just put together some narratives.
**Kmass**: We took their request for proposal and we.
**Kmass**: I had Andrew, he took it and put it in word so we could edit and make it make more sense for our subs.
**Kmass**: Talked to Christian over there at Siva.
**Kmass**: He said we'll just figure concrete floors everywhere except the offices that get the carpet squares, their drawings.
**Kmass**: They something's messed up with the ones that Jared sent.
**Kmass**: They switched the bathrooms just to orientation them in the two added break rooms.
**Kmass**: So Christian's going to get it fix that.
**Kmass**: But overall we should be able to get budget numbers for the rest of their construction based off of that.
**Kmass**: So Jesse sent me back all the subs he's contacted.
**Kmass**: I got Andrew getting those guys into our form and we'll email out to all the ones we have for today.
**Jdawson**: I.
**Jdawson**: I started calling on lights and I sent a couple emails.
**Jdawson**: I think I cc'd you on it.
**Jdawson**: Trying to lead times on and on that stuff.
**Kmass**: Is this correct here?
**Kmass**: Let's share my screen for one second here for you sharing.
**Kmass**: Wrong one.
**Kmass**: See here this one.
**Kmass**: This file is so gigantic it's a pain in the ass to work with.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Kmass**: So when we send to the electricians for lighting, is this when they talked them, they were saying speed bays like these highlighted yellow areas.
**Kmass**: That's the 40 foot candle.
**Kmass**: And then everything else in the racking is 30 correct.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Kmass**: All right.
**Kmass**: But you're just gonna do a budget number on the lighting.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I sent them a budget number already.
**Jdawson**: Now I'm trying to find lead times and then you know, they said that they wanted obviously like in my original number I did not have any lighting in the speed bays.
**Jdawson**: So I've gotta account for that.
**Jdawson**: And then I think exit signs too.
**Kmass**: So your number, the initial one was just for the racking lights.
**Kmass**: Yep.
**Kmass**: Well, hopefully Hermes doesn't think that that was your number for everything.
**Kmass**: I guess he's traveling back to Arizona today.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, so yeah, I got to get that lighting to them tomorrow.
**Kmass**: Which subs are you asking for lead times from?
**Jdawson**: I didn't call any subs.
**Jdawson**: I called the lighting rep.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I Just called city electric and whatever.
**Jdawson**: I can't remember whoever.
**Jdawson**: I emailed you on the email with me.
**Kmass**: Okay, so he can take the.
**Kmass**: Does he have this plan or does he need this plan sent?
**Kmass**: Or did you already send him something like this?
**Jdawson**: No, I just told him, I said I, you know, I just need to know the lead time.
**Jdawson**: I said, you know, 2000, you know, lights is what I'm looking for, you know, but in reality, I just need to know, you know, what's the like, what's the lead time?
**Jdawson**: Is it four weeks, six weeks?
**Jdawson**: That's all I'm chasing is the lead time.
**Jdawson**: Really.
**Jdawson**: You know, I've got a.
**Jdawson**: I've got a budget for the lights.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: By a lot of expansion.

**Gducharme**: So Jesse's going to talk with the owner and see if we.
**Gducharme**: We can design it in a way that will save the owner money.
**Kmass**: Yeah, like I got a task.
**Kmass**: I've been trying to get this storm capture sub on the phone.
**Kmass**: Just either miss his calls or he misses mine.
**Kmass**: So we're gonna redesign the site so that we get rid of all the elevated slab in the building is what we're going to propose.

**Kmass**: You dealt with him some, didn't you?
**Gducharme**: Yeah, I've worked with him.
