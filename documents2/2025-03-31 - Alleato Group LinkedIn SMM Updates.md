## Transcript
**Victoria**: It.
**Victoria**: Hi, Maria.
**Bclymer**: Hi.
**Bclymer**: Hi.
**Bclymer**: Hi.
**Victoria**: How are you?
**Bclymer**: Oh, good, good, good.
**Victoria**: Happy Monday.
**Bclymer**: Happy Monday.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Victoria**: Remind me, how old is your daughter now?
**Victoria**: Is she, like, almost four months?
**Bclymer**: Yes, she's gonna be four this coming Saturday.
**Victoria**: Four months already.
**Bclymer**: But she got a little bit, like, you know, like, a little bit congested, because where I live is very cold, and sometimes it can get really cold, but then super warm.
**Bclymer**: So she got a little bit of, you know, sneezing and everything, and we're like, oh, she's better now.
**Bclymer**: She was like, oh.
**Victoria**: Oh, my gosh.
**Victoria**: If it's cold, you're in Puerto Rico.
**Bclymer**: Colombia.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, Colombia.
**Jdawson**: You know.
**Victoria**: Sorry.
**Victoria**: Yeah, it's cold in Colombia.
**Victoria**: I can't imagine.
**Victoria**: Oh, my gosh.
**Victoria**: It must be.
**Bclymer**: I know.
**Victoria**: Oh, that's great.
**Victoria**: Well, we've got.
**Victoria**: We've got some good stuff to cover today for April content, so as soon as Brandon joins, we can start it.
**Jdawson**: Hi, Brandon.
**Mcalcetero**: Hey, guys.
**Victoria**: Hi.
**Victoria**: How you doing?
**Mcalcetero**: Well, Victoria, what do you do?
**Mcalcetero**: Like, why were you so sparkly?
**Jdawson**: I still have my hair done, which.
**Victoria**: Is why I'm not on camera, because.
**Jdawson**: I don't want to take it out.
**Jdawson**: I do aerial, so I was performing yesterday.
**Jdawson**: Last night, it's still there.
**Mcalcetero**: So are you going to join the circus?
**Jdawson**: I would love to join the circus, but I don't think you can make any money in the circus.
**Mcalcetero**: What's that thing that they do in Vegas?
**Mcalcetero**: Circus away.
**Jdawson**: I'm not quite that shredded to be doing that, but maybe one day Annika has suggested this, and I.
**Jdawson**: I think I had told her, like, I'm just getting used to being on the silks for five minutes at a time.
**Jdawson**: I don't know if I could imagine doing a whole hour up there.
**Jdawson**: That's really intense.
**Mcalcetero**: But I thought about doing that aerial stuff, but then I felt bad for everybody else because I would be so instantly good.
**Jdawson**: You would, because you're very strong, Maria.
**Jdawson**: You didn't get to see it because you don't have me on Instagram.
**Jdawson**: But this.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Last night, I had an aerial performance, and everyone who performed at different acts.
**Jdawson**: So one person did a fire show, like blowing fire out of their mouth.
**Jdawson**: Another person did lira, which is a hoop on stilts, which is crazy.
**Jdawson**: And then I perform on silks, which is my apparatus of choice.
**Jdawson**: And I was all dressed up with a bunch of sparkles, and my song was levitating by Dua Lipa.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So you.
**Mcalcetero**: Ariel, which is the little, like, grape type things with stilts.
**Jdawson**: Someone else did.
**Jdawson**: I.
**Jdawson**: I didn't do still.
**Jdawson**: It Was crazy.
**Mcalcetero**: No, it would be funny is if the person doing the fire, instead of using their mouth, use the other end.
**Mcalcetero**: That would be impressive.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: You know what?
**Jdawson**: I saw someone do that one time, and I thought it was so funny.
**Jdawson**: They thought it was very, like, beautiful and sexy, but when they held the fire to their butt, it just, like, exploded with fire.
**Jdawson**: It's like, that looks like something else.
**Mcalcetero**: It was like a.
**Ataylor**: Like a rocket.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, it looked like a rocket, but, Brandon, you could have done.
**Jdawson**: One of them was parkour.
**Jdawson**: And so they had these bars and they jumped around.
**Jdawson**: It kind of looked like gymnastics.
**Jdawson**: But you definitely could be good at that.
**Mcalcetero**: Same parkour.
**Mcalcetero**: That's, you know, I just think I'll stick to it, only being good at, you know, some things I don't want to, you know, hog at all.
**Jdawson**: I understand.
**Jdawson**: I understand.
**Jdawson**: Same.
**Jdawson**: Same here.
**Victoria**: That's great.
**Victoria**: My cat does parkour all the time.
**Victoria**: He jumps off the walls.
**Victoria**: He's gotten, like, six feet in the air.
**Victoria**: So he can join your performance.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, he could.
**Jdawson**: That's really funny, but okay.
**Jdawson**: Sorry to commandeer that, but that's why I have the glitter and I haven't been on camera, because I'm like, I'm not taking it out to.
**Jdawson**: Cute.
**Jdawson**: Keep it for a few days.
**Victoria**: Well, we can hop in to.
**Victoria**: I don't think I actually sent the agenda ahead of time, so that's on me today, but it's fairly straightforward.
**Victoria**: I don't know.
**Victoria**: Does anyone actually look at the agenda beforehand?
**Victoria**: Show of hands?
**Victoria**: Well, I'll keep sending it.
**Bclymer**: I do, I do.
**Bclymer**: I did check it out.
**Bclymer**: I'm like, okay, but that's it.
**Bclymer**: And then I close it, and then I'll wait for you.
**Victoria**: Yeah, there's something crazy on here.
**Victoria**: No, that's really good.
**Victoria**: I mean, we're gonna go through it all anyway.
**Victoria**: Um, so before we go into the content calendar, aj, I got all your videos for the drone stuff.
**Victoria**: I think it looks really good.
**Victoria**: Like, I looked at, like, the videos, you speaking, which is going to be really good for, like, voiceover also over the other footage we have.
**Victoria**: So I'll come up with something that's solid.
**Victoria**: So thank you for doing that.
**Victoria**: And then the other thing I want to ask about.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, I was more worried.
**Ataylor**: I was more worried about the quality, and I flubbed a couple times, so you should be able to get some.
**Ataylor**: But if I need to, like, take it on an iPhone or something with the tripod, I could probably do that.
**Victoria**: Yeah, yeah, no worries.
**Victoria**: Because with the audio quality we have, we use, like, this Adobe audio enhancer that works really well for the video quality.
**Victoria**: I can enhance it a little bit and then not use a ton of like the straight on talking head footage, but some different stuff.
**Victoria**: So I'll pick the best of what we got.
**Ataylor**: Perfect.
**Victoria**: Yeah.
**Victoria**: And then the leads list, do you have that by chance so we can send.
**Ataylor**: I.
**Ataylor**: I do.
**Ataylor**: It's pretty lengthy.
**Ataylor**: I think.
**Ataylor**: Brandon and I are meeting on Thursday over some business development stuff so I want to go through it with him and yeah, ask him a couple, a couple questions because we also have crossover and see if he wants to add any.
**Ataylor**: So it's kind of needs to be done anyway so we can.
**Ataylor**: It's been on my ball's been in my court to purge pipe drive contacts for a while.
**Ataylor**: So I'll be able to kill two birds with one stone with this.
**Victoria**: Yeah, that's great.
**Victoria**: So whenever you have that spreadsheet kind of ready.
**Victoria**: Is it, is it a spreadsheet or do you have like a list?
**Victoria**: Like.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, yeah, it's on.
**Ataylor**: It's all in pipe drive.
**Ataylor**: I've been picking away at deleting some guys and just seeing exactly who, but I can, I can export a CSV file really quickly, so that's great.
**Victoria**: Yeah.
**Victoria**: So once you have that kind of narrowed down and then we'll send the newsletter in April.
**Victoria**: I have to go through and make sure there's no mention of March so that we send in the right month.
**Victoria**: And then the other thing I want to know is what email address we want to send the email from.
**Victoria**: I believe once we add it in there, we might have to like authenticate it.
**Victoria**: So like maybe Maria or whoever has.
**Ataylor**: Access to this at the bottom.
**Ataylor**: Are you going to put like a, like a contact us type thing or something?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Victoria**: Okay, I'll share this.
**Ataylor**: We probably, we probably want to do.
**Mcalcetero**: Like a, a marketing type email because if you put mine or somebody's that gets flagged then it could be reported as jump.
**Victoria**: Yeah.
**Victoria**: If you have like hello@alito group.com or something like that, that's perfect.
**Victoria**: And if not, you can create one.
**Victoria**: Maybe you know, Maria can.
**Mcalcetero**: Maria can get that taken care of.
**Bclymer**: We already have one for marketing, so I'll send it to you.
**Victoria**: Perfect.
**Victoria**: Okay.
**Victoria**: So I'll work with you, Maria to authenticate it if that's needed.
**Victoria**: So we'll send it from the marketing email.
**Victoria**: Is it marketinglitogroup.com correct?
**Bclymer**: That's the one.
**Victoria**: Perfect.
**Victoria**: And then this is what we went through before.
**Victoria**: I made sure that the orange was a little More prevalent.
**Victoria**: And then there is like a Call us today, Contact us.
**Victoria**: And then this is like the social sound here at the bottom, obviously, but there's no X, so I'll take that part out.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so you can add instead of.
**Bclymer**: So which ones do you have?
**Bclymer**: You have Instagram and Facebook.
**Victoria**: Facebook and.
**Victoria**: Well, I don't actually know if you guys use Facebook.
**Victoria**: I haven't edited these specifically, so I need to add in LinkedIn.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, correct.
**Bclymer**: LinkedIn.
**Victoria**: Yeah.
**Victoria**: Do you have Facebook at all?
**Victoria**: I don't.
**Bclymer**: No, we don't.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, yeah, yeah, we do.
**Ataylor**: I just have no idea what the password is or the login email.
**Ataylor**: So I need to get that.
**Ataylor**: Maria, remind me to do that, please.
**Bclymer**: Okay, I will.
**Bclymer**: Thank you.
**Bclymer**: Aj.
**Jdawson**: There's no password.
**Jdawson**: Aj, Just so you know, Facebook accounts like Facebook business pages are set up with admin, so you should be an administrator of it or somebody else previously in the organization.
**Jdawson**: So just so you don't go on a wild.
**Jdawson**: It's never going to be a password for Facebook accounts.
**Jdawson**: LinkedIn.
**Ataylor**: I can just.
**Ataylor**: So I can just make Maria and you guys admins.
**Ataylor**: Yes, even better.
**Jdawson**: Annika, I think you're on Facebook as Bonner.
**Jdawson**: I can't remember.
**Victoria**: Annika Bonner.
**Victoria**: Yeah, yeah.
**Victoria**: Make sure it's mine.
**Victoria**: Perfect last name.
**Victoria**: Yes, that looks good.
**Victoria**: And I see the Facebook page out here now, so perfect.
**Victoria**: Okay, so I'll keep the link to it and I'll update those so that it's all looks nice and good.
**Victoria**: And then I don't think there's any mention of March here.
**Victoria**: Yeah, so.
**Victoria**: So this will be good to go out anytime in April that we're ready.
**Victoria**: So let's go back to.
**Victoria**: I'll just go to the content calendar.
**Victoria**: So for this one, we have the first April Fool's Day coming up.
