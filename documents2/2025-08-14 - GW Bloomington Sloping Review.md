## Transcript
**Amulder**: How's it going, Andrew?
**Jdawson**: Hey, how's it going?
**Jremillard**: Hey, Andrew.
**Jdawson**: Hey.
**Jremillard**: You driving in Illinois?
**Jdawson**: Nope, not today.
**Amulder**: I think he said he's at Bloomington today.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we just.
**Jdawson**: We Left there about 20 minutes ago, but yeah, we were in Bloomington.
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: Well, I don't know if you've met Jesse R. Yet.
**Jremillard**: Remillard, he's our senior pm.
**Jremillard**: He's gonna.
**Jremillard**: He helps with all the eyes and all the job sites.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: I don't think so.
**Jdawson**: Hey.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: You can't have two Jesse's though.
**Jremillard**: I know.
**Jremillard**: That's why I'm gonna have to like stop coming to these meetings.
**Jremillard**: It gets confusing.
**Jremillard**: Are you able to look at the screen, Andrew?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I'm going to stop here in a second and look at it.
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: I'm only.
**Jremillard**: I'll run through this just because I've been looking at it probably the most to hopefully explain it.
**Jremillard**: Easiest manner here.
**Jremillard**: Just let us know whenever you're ready.
**Jremillard**: We'll start going through it.
**Jdawson**: Yep, all good.
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: So, you know, initially like this used to be just a sidewalk.
**Jremillard**: Dropped down 6 inches and then it ran to the inlet box.
**Jremillard**: Well, they designed it so it's all flush, you know, going into the donation vestibule.
**Jremillard**: But when you do that, now we're dropping a foot and a half from the top of the sidewalk or finish floor to that storm inlet.
**Jremillard**: So if you can imagine underneath the canopy there'd be a foot and a half of fall from the door out.
**Jremillard**: And I can't imagine that's what you would want.
**Jdawson**: No, that's pretty steep.
**Jremillard**: So, you know, looking at that, the options that, you know, we just got off the phone with Brian over Kimley Horn and he redrew it.
**Jremillard**: You know, there's a couple options like, because we got to deal with, you know, the existing drainage in the area, you know, we can't do whatever we want there in the canopy.
**Jremillard**: So if we minimize and try to stay in the same footprint, we could adjust it like this.
**Jremillard**: But you're still going to have over a foot of fall to that.
**Jremillard**: I don't know if you can zoom in next so I can read the grades there.
**Jremillard**: You're going from 80978 to 80865.
**Jremillard**: So it's like a foot and two inches say.
**Jremillard**: So that would.
**Jremillard**: That's one option we have.
**Jremillard**: And then the other option, if you go to that one, he just sent this.
**Jremillard**: You know, our cut line, currently, you know, where we cut the pavement just out past the canopy and then over to the corner.
**Jremillard**: If we took that Red line and took the pavement out, we could raise that inlet up to 20925.
**Jremillard**: So now you're talking.
**Jremillard**: Zoom in there, Nick.
**Jremillard**: 80925.
**Jremillard**: So now we're only six inches.
**Jremillard**: So now you're almost flat underneath that canopy in.
**Jremillard**: In that dimension.
**Jremillard**: But we just.
**Jremillard**: We'd have to extend that cut line out to there to.
**Jremillard**: To tie it all in.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I'm.
**Jdawson**: That seems much better than having the, the foot slope there.
**Jdawson**: So I'm, I'm good with that.
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Is that just cutting that out and then regrading it and then astral.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, since we're raising the grade, it'd be a little extra stone base to adjust those and then some extra asphalt, you know, but then, you know, since they haven't started it yet, it's.
**Jremillard**: It's not like a remobilization or anything.
**Jremillard**: It would just be a matter of, you know, bringing the material and just having more material and install.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Then that.
**Jdawson**: Would that affect the parking spots at.
**Jremillard**: All on that side?
**Jremillard**: Nope.
**Jremillard**: And you know, then, you know, not that it matters, but you know, because if you go up to the top left corner, Nick, that, that was always very almost flat from when you go to that corner of the sidewalk.
**Jremillard**: And because the water has to drain all the way down to the canopy because the storm inlet on the.
**Jremillard**: In the dry alleyway is higher than everything down here.
**Jdawson**: That's right.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Jremillard**: So.
**Jremillard**: So that pavement, we.
**Jremillard**: He sloped it up a little bit.
**Jremillard**: So instead of having a 6 inch sidewalk edge, you will have like a 4 inch difference by the time you get up to that top corner.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: Just so, just so we can add some.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, like this.
**Jremillard**: As it gets closer to the dumpsters, it'll.
**Jremillard**: You'll have less of a sidewalk step up.
**Jremillard**: But since it's not, you know, the cars aren't pulling up to it or anything, it's, you know, it doesn't really serve any purpose to stop anything.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm good with that.
**Jdawson**: With that plan.
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: All right, well, nickel.
**Jremillard**: Get that.
**Jremillard**: He'll get that priced up, see what that'll be.
**Jremillard**: And then we'll get it over to you so we can get a quick answer.
**Jremillard**: I think they're ready to.
**Jremillard**: I mean, they were out there today trying to figure out these grades and, you know, this wasn't looking.
**Jremillard**: It always looks nice on paper until you start reading the numbers and then you're like, wait a minute, this is a.
**Jremillard**: A little too steep.
**Jdawson**: Yep, that's fine.
**Jremillard**: Okay, well, very good.
**Jremillard**: We'll get it to you so we can.
**Jremillard**: Nick, I don't know if you can get that from them today or if it's tomorrow.
**Amulder**: Yeah, yeah, I'll try to work on that.
**Jremillard**: Okay, cool.
**Jremillard**: That'll work.
**Amulder**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: All right.
**Jremillard**: Thanks, Heather.
**Jdawson**: Thanks, guys.
