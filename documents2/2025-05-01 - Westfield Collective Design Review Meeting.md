## Transcript
**Bclymer**: SA.
**Jdawson**: Chad, you get your computer working?
**Bclymer**: I did.
**Jdawson**: You did?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Well, just reset it again.
**Bclymer**: Threw it up against the wall a few times.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, hard reset.
**Jdawson**: That's how I got my first job in tech support.
**Jdawson**: Smashed it, put an insurance claim, gave him a new computer back.
**Bclymer**: I'm working on setting up the time lapse camera right now.
**Jdawson**: Made it almost two months before Geek Squad caught on and fired me.
**Jdawson**: Well, we should be wrapping these meetings up here.
**Jdawson**: Maybe this one.
**Jdawson**: Maybe.
**Jdawson**: Maybe one more if we need it next week.
**Jdawson**: But a lot of people have dropped off.
**Jdawson**: We don't really need civil stuff anymore.
**Nbigler**: We're kind of at the final, final.
**Jdawson**: Push here after getting the foundations yesterday.
**Jdawson**: So now we got BO on here for kitchens or bo.
**Jdawson**: You're with Captivair, right?
**Jdawson**: Correct.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah.
**Awoodhams**: Good.
**Nbigler**: See, Micah will not make it.
**Awoodhams**: Do.
**Nbigler**: A couple more minutes.
**Nbigler**: See if Nick and I don't know if Jerrica's gonna get on.
**Nbigler**: She probably.
**Nbigler**: Probably did what she needed to do.
**Gdesmit**: For moral support.
**Gdesmit**: If you need anything, you.
**Jdawson**: You're here for moral support?
**Gdesmit**: Yeah.
**Nbigler**: Yeah, I don't know about that.
**Jdawson**: You got.
**Jdawson**: You got presentations in.
**Nbigler**: In architectural.
**Nbigler**: The architectural part of the meeting.
**Gdesmit**: Huh?
**Nbigler**: I just know.
**Nbigler**: Just check and see.
**Jdawson**: I assume you haven't really done anything after we moved.
**Jdawson**: Move those posts, but did you.
**Jdawson**: Did you see that they are 6 inch, 6 by 6 HSS for those.
**Nbigler**: Three columns you're adding?
**Awoodhams**: No.
**Gdesmit**: Did that come through this morning?
**Jdawson**: No, I don't.
**Jdawson**: I think Nick had emailed yesterday or the day before so that he did get confirmation that they were only going to be six buys that they're posting up for those three columns that we added.
**Gdesmit**: I did not see that.
**Nbigler**: There's Nick right now.
**Awoodhams**: Hello.
**Jdawson**: The man who was able to slide.
**Nbigler**: Six inches in there perfectly for us.
**Jdawson**: On what, our three new columns?
**Ashton**: Yeah, the base plates are all 12 by 12, but all.
**Ashton**: I think.
**Ashton**: I believe all of the mezzanine columns will be six by six.
**Jdawson**: Oh, all of them.
**Jdawson**: Not just the ones that we added.
**Ashton**: Correct.
**Jdawson**: Call it 10 inches.
**Ashton**: What was that?
**Jdawson**: They're 10 inches on your drawings now.
**Jdawson**: You like your D.
**Jdawson**: What is it?
**Jdawson**: D1.
**Nbigler**: Oh, hold on.
**Nbigler**: Where the heck.
**Jdawson**: Get back to J line.
**Awoodhams**: There we go.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, your D1 column there, those are 10 by 10, right, Jeff?
**Jdawson**: Is that what we looked at the other day?
**Gdesmit**: Yeah.
**Ashton**: She's talking about all D3s.
**Ashton**: She.
**Ashton**: Project coordinators, who I'm referring to.
**Ashton**: She called me yesterday and said that those new columns, we're going to match the other ones that were on site and they should be six by six is what she told me verbally.
**Ashton**: So.
**Gdesmit**: Yeah, the 10 by is maybe just the ones that go from floor to roof in the corner.
**Jdawson**: And is.
**Jdawson**: Is it just the north corner?
**Jdawson**: Because these ones up here on the south corner.
**Jdawson**: These are.
**Gdesmit**: Yeah, those all look small.
**Gdesmit**: Yeah.
**Gdesmit**: So that's good.
**Gdesmit**: So those are all sixes, and then the two.
**Gdesmit**: The only ones that.
**Gdesmit**: Are those that are going top to bottom.
**Ashton**: Those are the tens, probably.
**Awoodhams**: Yep.
**Gdesmit**: Okay.
**Ashton**: So I get extra credit for saving you all those inches or what?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I think.
**Jdawson**: I think you're gonna back charge Jeff since he doesn't have to redesign a wall.
**Nbigler**: Right.
**Ashton**: Jeff, let's.
**Gdesmit**: Let's hold that enthusiasm until we get all the joy steps, please.
**Ashton**: Yeah.
**Nbigler**: All right.
**Jdawson**: So, yeah, this one goes all the way up to the ceiling.
**Jdawson**: So here's.
**Jdawson**: Here's what we're looking at on.
**Jdawson**: On J line, Nick.
**Jdawson**: These two columns here are the ones on either side.
**Jdawson**: We're going to be adding that other one right here.
**Jdawson**: The mezzanine, Correct?
**Ashton**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: This your J line.
**Jdawson**: So if we look at a B line.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah.
**Ashton**: It should be a mainframe clear span.
**Ashton**: Yeah.
**Ashton**: One of those probably looks like B.
**Awoodhams**: There you go.
**Ashton**: There you go.
**Ashton**: That's where the canopy is.
**Jdawson**: Right, Right.
**Jdawson**: So where's.
**Ashton**: Yeah, there's no full high columns on the beeline to show there.
**Ashton**: Everything that you see on that mezzanine plan, that's just a submittal to size and detail.
**Ashton**: Everything with New Millennium.
**Ashton**: Right.
**Awoodhams**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So we're.
**Jdawson**: We wouldn't.
**Jdawson**: It's not going to show an elevation shot of that of B line because it's not a full height column.
**Jdawson**: Or is it just going to be.
**Ashton**: Yeah, all this stuff is the sheeting until you get to the mezzanine floor plan.
**Nbigler**: Yeah, that's way back.
**Nbigler**: Way back here, page 28.
**Awoodhams**: Cool.
**Awoodhams**: Okay.
**Nbigler**: We have everybody.
**Jdawson**: Looks like we do.
**Jdawson**: All right, so Jerrica got us up the foundations plan yesterday.
**Jdawson**: New CAD drawings.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Nbigler**: Pull that up real quick so.
**Jdawson**: We can look through this.
**Jdawson**: So it looks like what you did, Jerrica, is you just made one big footer here for the stairs.
**Brhoades**: Yeah, we were.
**Brhoades**: We just wanted to make sure we capture the maximum size that it'll be for.
**Brhoades**: For those two new added columns.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah.
**Nbigler**: And then here, too.
**Brhoades**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Are these just too close together or.
**Jdawson**: You don't know?
**Brhoades**: Those were very close together.
**Brhoades**: So.
**Jdawson**: Okay, I had one question about this.
**Nbigler**: So we.
**Jdawson**: We are keeping these two columns.
**Jdawson**: So we added a footer there, but we still.
**Jdawson**: The stair will have the landing here.
**Jdawson**: So those support legs will either Be here or here.
**Jdawson**: So we still need a thickened slab there for that, right?
**Brhoades**: Yes, we will.
**Jdawson**: I don't know where I told them to put it at the front of the landing.
**Nbigler**: So technically that would be there.
**Brhoades**: There.
**Brhoades**: Well, I'm not sure if they'll need a column there, just with the steel support so close.
**Awoodhams**: Okay.
**Brhoades**: Well, it kind of depends on how they configure that.
**Brhoades**: And, yeah, those don't require geo peer, so we can come back to that.
**Nbigler**: Okay, so we just address the thickest lab here.
**Nbigler**: Here?
**Brhoades**: Yeah.
**Awoodhams**: Here.
**Brhoades**: Yeah.
**Awoodhams**: Okay.
**Awoodhams**: Here.
**Awoodhams**: Perfect.
**Awoodhams**: All right.
**Jdawson**: And we did go back to regular bars in here.
**Nbigler**: Look at all the grade beams except for at the masonry.
**Brhoades**: Yep.
**Nbigler**: And then all of our footings are.
**Brhoades**: Either 1 foot thick or 28 inches.
**Brhoades**: I guess there's some 16 inches, too, but.
**Awoodhams**: Okay.
**Nbigler**: Thank you for that effort.
**Nbigler**: That saved us a good amount of added costs that were obviously not.
**Jdawson**: Not needed.
**Jdawson**: The concrete started to creep up, especially.
**Nbigler**: Once we had the soils and AG.
**Jdawson**: Peers all added in.
**Jdawson**: So, Nick, when do you expect.
**Jdawson**: Now that you have these foundations, are you able to get some final drawings back in from Varco?
**Jdawson**: And has this pushed your delivery date out significantly at this point, or was.
**Nbigler**: What are we thinking with this?
**Ashton**: I have not heard that.
**Ashton**: That is not the case as far.
**Jdawson**: Like, as far as delivery to the site.
**Jdawson**: What.
**Ashton**: What I told them was, hey, if you have to delay any of the mezzanine steel, you know, that would be fine.
**Ashton**: And I have not heard if they have to do that or not, because we don't.
**Ashton**: We're not going to be setting the mezzanine for a while anyways.
**Ashton**: Right.
**Ashton**: So.
**Awoodhams**: Okay.
**Ashton**: Yeah.
**Ashton**: They have not said anything about pushing back our delivery.
**Jdawson**: Okay, then what about the drawings?
**Ashton**: Yeah, I.
**Ashton**: I know that they're getting a updated set.
**Ashton**: I don't know when we're gonna get that, but I will let you know.
**Jdawson**: All right, and this is going to come up in the next one, Jeff.
**Jdawson**: But while we're on it, I have CDRs.
**Jdawson**: So you've submitted for everybody except electrical, right?
**Gdesmit**: Yeah.
**Gdesmit**: Yeah.
**Gdesmit**: I'm going to pull it up right now.
**Gdesmit**: I want to just double check everything that's on there.
**Gdesmit**: Let's see.
**Gdesmit**: Upload additional.
**Gdesmit**: It's going to shoot out a stupid email, but it's fine.
**Gdesmit**: Every time you log into it, it sends one.
**Jdawson**: I'm tracking that.
**Jdawson**: I'm missing electrical and then the foundation CDRs.
**Jdawson**: Is that.
**Jdawson**: Do you.
**Jdawson**: Do you have either of those?
**Gdesmit**: Foundation CDR is already up because that was submitted as part of the early foundation review.
**Gdesmit**: So that's up there.
**Gdesmit**: So the ones that are up there.
**Jdawson**: Can you shoot me a copy of that?
**Jdawson**: The signed one?
**Nbigler**: I don't have it.
**Gdesmit**: Yeah, I will.
**Gdesmit**: So we have the original foundation release request cdr.
**Gdesmit**: That one is on.
**Gdesmit**: In addition to the foundation permit set, the mechanical and plumbing CDR is up there.
**Gdesmit**: The com check is up there.
**Gdesmit**: The plumbing, mechanical drawings are up.
**Gdesmit**: The architectural state permit set is up.
**Gdesmit**: The envelope comm check.
**Gdesmit**: Let's see.
**Gdesmit**: So it looks like we also have Amy Locker from Deem submitted Westfield Collective electrical plans on 417.
**Gdesmit**: The CDR for electrical is up there as well as the com check.
**Jdawson**: I don't have that cdr.
**Jdawson**: They asked for a signed copy.
**Jdawson**: We sent it to Alex and then he must have sent it off and he never gave us a copy back.
**Gdesmit**: Yeah, I don't have it either.
**Gdesmit**: So I'd reach out to Dean.
**Gdesmit**: It looks like Amy Locker was who uploaded everything.
**Gdesmit**: So I would just ask her to send everything that was uploaded, including the com check.
**Gdesmit**: So you guys have it.
**Gdesmit**: And then the most recent ones that were put up, I had to resubmit the.
**Gdesmit**: The CDR that was signed by Varco, Prudent and Jericho because I had put it under the wrong category.
**Gdesmit**: And they were like, can you please re upload it under the right one?
**Gdesmit**: So I did that as well as the civil plans and the signed civil cdr.
**Gdesmit**: So that should be everything.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so everything is.
**Jdawson**: Everything is into them.
**Gdesmit**: Yeah.
**Gdesmit**: The only thing that I'm not seeing is fire protection, but that's normal.
**Jdawson**: Okay, can I take this CDR here and use this for my building permit then?
**Jdawson**: Because everything's tied to this one, right?
**Gdesmit**: No, that's just the foundation release.
**Jdawson**: So this was.
**Gdesmit**: We do not have the.
**Gdesmit**: We do not have the state cdr.
**Awoodhams**: Got it.
**Gdesmit**: We forgot all the applications in.
**Gdesmit**: But the last check that was run on the 29th was when she had requested the civil stuff.
**Gdesmit**: So I will let you know as soon as the actual.
**Gdesmit**: The actual state permit comes through.
**Gdesmit**: But we do not have that hand.
**Gdesmit**: Everything's been uploaded.
**Gdesmit**: As far as the applications and the drawings, we just.
**Gdesmit**: It hasn't been.
**Gdesmit**: That their review hasn't been finalized.
**Gdesmit**: So you guys can keep plugging away on foundations and everything, but it shouldn't hold anything up.
**Jdawson**: Spire alarm and suppression.
**Jdawson**: Are they.
**Jdawson**: They're going to need a suppression fire suppression system Drawings as well, I assume.
**Gdesmit**: Yeah.
**Gdesmit**: Yeah, but those guys will.
**Gdesmit**: Yeah, those guys are familiar with uploading everything, so should be good.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: I think you already answered this, Nick, but we're Going to keep the same base plates and anchor rods that we have throughout.
**Jdawson**: And if those.
**Jdawson**: If those other ones were six by.
**Nbigler**: Six already, then I guess that wouldn't.
**Jdawson**: That wouldn't change.
**Jdawson**: But you're not planning on adding any new anchor rods or base plates to add to that submittal, right?
**Ashton**: Correct.
**Awoodhams**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So, Jericho, do you need us to resubmit on these now that the locations are changing?
**Awoodhams**: If.
**Jdawson**: If none of the base plates or anchor rod sizing is changing.
**Brhoades**: I would like to have it for record, but I don't think it needs to like be a submittal.
**Awoodhams**: Okay.
**Ashton**: Yeah, as soon as I get that, obviously your merit's gonna need it.
**Ashton**: Jerrica's gonna want it, all that stuff for their records.
**Ashton**: And then we'll get that date, we'll get, you know, plan north located on those drawings to where it's clear for merit and.
**Ashton**: Yeah, I think that's it.
**Jdawson**: All right, Jericho, we talked about cnc.
**Jdawson**: They're gonna go ahead and redo their like that.
**Jdawson**: A death in the family for the guy who does it, but he's either back today or something.
**Jdawson**: So they're gonna try and get us that today and weather pending which day they start next week, but they will.
**Jdawson**: They are planning on getting out there next week and taking two to three days and get these piers in.
**Brhoades**: That's good.
**Jdawson**: Off of the races with concrete.
**Jdawson**: Hey, status and mezzanine opening.
**Jdawson**: So, Nick, do you have everything that you needed on this question?
**Jdawson**: All the openings were acting and everything.
**Ashton**: I mean, I don't have the mezzanine layout yet, so I'm also waiting for that.
**Ashton**: I think that everything should, worst case scenario, fit in between the joist spacing because there's nothing wider than 20 inches.
**Ashton**: But I've seen.
**Ashton**: I guess so if indeed there's going to be anything wider than 20 inches, then you kind of have to be careful about, you know, we don't want to cut any bar joists.
**Ashton**: Right?
**Ashton**: That's not the plan right now.
**Ashton**: So either we box, we increase the box boxing out of the columns and run stuff up there, or what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna order loose four stop angle from Varco Prudin and just field locate it.
**Ashton**: So basically, if anything needs to change, I think it's just wise to have too much angle.
**Ashton**: And we'll get everything on site with Chad and the mechanical guys, locations on site, and we will fit them in between our joists and box them out accordingly.
**Awoodhams**: Okay.
**Ashton**: There any concerns there or anything we need to think about?
**Ashton**: Jerrica.
**Ashton**: If we feel locate that.
**Ashton**: I mean, it's going to come from Varco Prudent.
**Gdesmit**: Right.
**Ashton**: They're the ones that are going to be sizing any type of poor.
**Ashton**: Stop.
**Brhoades**: Yeah, I don't see any issue on my end.
**Ashton**: I'm sorry, what did you say, Jerrica?
**Brhoades**: Oh, sorry.
**Brhoades**: I don't see an issue with that on my end.
**Ashton**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: All right, next down, architectural design.
**Jdawson**: That's kind of going to wrap it.
**Nbigler**: Up unless anybody else has anything to.
**Jdawson**: Chip in for today.
**Jdawson**: Jeff, do you have anything you want to share on any design updates?
**Gdesmit**: No.
**Gdesmit**: So I think from updates, has there been any feedback from the owner?
**Gdesmit**: Are we adding.
**Gdesmit**: We're currently not adding a bathroom in the volleyball slide, correct?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: As far as any of this stuff for splitting the building, I have nothing.
**Jdawson**: I have no further information other than we just did the deduct change order for that.
**Jdawson**: So we know we had to do the wall of the door rating.
**Jdawson**: I know you already took care of that.
**Nbigler**: What else do I have here?
**Jdawson**: Bathrooms.
**Jdawson**: Move that door and add bathroom.
**Gdesmit**: Yeah.
**Nbigler**: No, yeah.
**Gdesmit**: So I think then the only thing that we need to kind of wrap up some of our final like section details and get you guys a quote unquote, you know, issued for construction set is we need to finalize the joist depths.
**Gdesmit**: Right.
**Gdesmit**: So we can make sure that we don't have to change into the exterior openings.
**Gdesmit**: Also need the really just for the mezzanine opening.
**Gdesmit**: And that's.
**Gdesmit**: That's really probably the only one.
**Gdesmit**: The.
**Gdesmit**: The ones on the outside aren't as big of a deal because they're just going to be where they're going to be.
**Gdesmit**: But at least for the mezzanine opening, we need center line of beam to outside face of edjangle to the actual like pour stop.
**Gdesmit**: Right.
**Gdesmit**: So we can, we can double check all that actual opening size railing locations as well as how those walls are coming up to the bottom of that.
**Gdesmit**: So it's.
**Gdesmit**: It's really just those and then an updated IFC model whenever it's complete.
**Nbigler**: Beth, they.
**Jdawson**: Varco Prudent hasn't given you that answer yet either, huh?
**Jdawson**: From the outside angle to the center line of column yet?
**Jdawson**: Nick?
**Ashton**: No, they're.
**Ashton**: They are just changing everything based on, you know, we're trying to not delay anything.
**Ashton**: Right?
**Gdesmit**: Yeah.
**Ashton**: So one step at a time has been.
**Ashton**: Well, all the base plate elevations are incorrect.
**Ashton**: So they're taking care of that.
**Ashton**: They're adding the columns.
**Ashton**: Right.
**Ashton**: Got to get all the kind of zoom out 40,000ft level.
**Ashton**: Like hey, please do this and then.
**Ashton**: Okay.
**Ashton**: Like, we need to get joy steps too.
**Ashton**: Don't forget.
**Ashton**: Right.
**Ashton**: So, yeah, they're still waiting on New Millennium for that.
**Gdesmit**: Okay.
**Ashton**: Yeah.
**Gdesmit**: I mean, it's, it's not, I mean, you guys are going to be doing egg peers and foundations for how long?
**Nbigler**: When, I mean, AG peers will be.
**Jdawson**: In and out of there next week and then we're kind of held off right now.
**Jdawson**: I still got to go through ilp and with the foundations just coming out last night, the concrete guys need, you know, a month to go through rebar shop drawings and fab.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Gdesmit**: So obviously I don't want to drag this out, but it's not like if we don't have everything in the next, you know, five days, we're going to be, you know, basically sitting with our hands tied.
**Gdesmit**: So I, I'm not terribly concerned about it.
**Gdesmit**: But if it goes, you know, another two weeks and we still don't have this because it's not like it's going to be something where as soon as we have it, it's, you know, you guys have everything finalized the next day.
**Gdesmit**: Right.
**Gdesmit**: It's, it's going to take a little bit.
**Gdesmit**: Not like a lot of time, but you know, it's not going to be a 24 hour turnaround.
**Ashton**: So.
**Ashton**: Yeah.
**Ashton**: Jeff, when are you trying to get a four construction set out?
**Gdesmit**: I mean, I'd like to have it out.
**Gdesmit**: I guess we'd have to look at, I don't, I don't want to say a date.
**Gdesmit**: And then Glenn be like, well, that doesn't work for us.
**Gdesmit**: Right.
**Gdesmit**: You know, it's, there's, you know, it's basically whenever we have the state CDR and they need it to actually, you know, order the, you know, and actual start constructing the non structural items.
**Gdesmit**: Right.
**Ashton**: Okay.
**Gdesmit**: You know, to Glenn's point, if they're going to be doing, you know, the rebar for all the footings and everything, that's going to be a month.
**Gdesmit**: Well, you know, you could realistically say, okay, it needs to be done by the end of May, but I know that feels like a really long time.
**Ashton**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jdawson**: I mean, we got guys that have to go through submittals, all the other stuff too.
**Gdesmit**: Correct.
**Gdesmit**: Yeah, yeah.
**Ashton**: I just want to give Varco Prudent a day, you know, instead of saying, hey, give us the mezzanine depths.
**Ashton**: Yeah, whatever you want.
**Gdesmit**: I mean, could we, could we say that?
**Gdesmit**: Can we get everything by like all the answers that we need, including an updated IFC by the 16th?
**Awoodhams**: Okay.
**Ashton**: I like that.
**Gdesmit**: It gives them about two weeks, and then when my goal would then be to basically take a week, go through everything, wrap up all of our detailing, and then issue guys a set so we can wrap this up 16.
**Jdawson**: So two weeks from now.
**Gdesmit**: Yeah.
**Gdesmit**: And then what that would also do is that gives us two weeks to meet with Mike whenever they're available, discuss any interior updates, and also loop all those changes, if any, back into the set.
**Gdesmit**: So you guys have everything documented properly for paint and finishes and all the.
**Nbigler**: Rest of that stuff.
**Jdawson**: So, I mean, realistically, that's still not an IFC set from you until the 23rd, if not the week of the 26th.
**Gdesmit**: Yeah, yeah.
**Gdesmit**: But again, right.
**Gdesmit**: With the state permits that being in, hopefully there's.
**Gdesmit**: There's not, you know, with the exception of you kind of going back there double checking quantities for, you know, paint and material finishes, it shouldn't really have that have any effect on budgeting.
**Jdawson**: No.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, you're right.
**Jdawson**: Most of my submittals is stuff that it's.
**Nbigler**: That is already kind of decided for the most part.
**Jdawson**: You know, a few tile and some finishes.
**Nbigler**: But, yeah, I think.
**Nbigler**: I think I was just.
**Jdawson**: I was trying to get everybody the smells in by the end of May.
**Nbigler**: And be done with them.
**Nbigler**: But, you know, we're also trying to start on March 17, and that didn't happen.
**Gdesmit**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So I can.
**Jdawson**: I can wish all I want.
**Nbigler**: Right.
**Ashton**: Hey, Glenn.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Ashton**: If they're tying, rebar, or doing whatever they're doing for a month, when do you need anchor bolts on site?
**Jdawson**: I mean, I would say just the last weekend, last week in May.
**Jdawson**: So they were planning on cutting and starting that on May 19th.
**Jdawson**: So I think right now, if they're pushing that out, I think we just kind of figured out May 19, so June 2.
**Awoodhams**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So we can get around quickly as.
**Nbigler**: You can get them made.
**Jdawson**: Quickly as you can get them made correctly.
**Ashton**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Jesse says get them as quickly as you can get them made.
**Jdawson**: I just add correctly to that.
**Ashton**: Yeah.
**Ashton**: So I need from Jerrica, you know, the shape of the bolts, the embedment for the mainframe columns, the embedment, like, for the mezzanine columns.
**Ashton**: So typically they take three to five business days to be made correctly and then make some decisions like, hey, you know, Leamaster in Varco, we don't see any reason for two inches of grout.
**Ashton**: But in order for me to order the right number of heavy hex nuts and washers and all that, a decision is going to be.
**Ashton**: Have to be made about grout.
**Ashton**: And then the decision is Going to be.
**Ashton**: Have to be made if we're doing straight anchor bolts and all that good stuff.
**Ashton**: So right now.
**Ashton**: So right now, you know, VP's got the 4 inch projection above the base plates based on their shop drawings.
**Ashton**: And then we just need to know, like, hey, you know, heavy hex nut and washer up top, no grout pad.
**Ashton**: And then, you know, 20 inch embedment plus, you know, another heavy hex nut or a hook at the bottom.
**Ashton**: So we'll just need to know that information in a couple weeks.
**Brhoades**: Yeah.
**Brhoades**: So most of that is on our updated drawings.
**Brhoades**: Okay.
**Brhoades**: We did, like, Glenn was looking at it on the most recent set.
**Brhoades**: We did provide a rad schedule.
**Brhoades**: If you go to the next page, Glenn, Our column, base plate schedule is what we ended up calling it.
**Brhoades**: And we're referencing the VP base plate mark and just kind of regurgitating some of that information and providing the depths.
**Ashton**: Sure.
**Brhoades**: They are all straight.
**Ashton**: Okay.
**Brhoades**: Anchor rods.
**Ashton**: Nice.
**Ashton**: Okay, so it's there?
**Brhoades**: Yeah, it's there.
**Ashton**: Wow.
**Ashton**: And then I just figured they'd be deeper, but that's awesome.
**Ashton**: Okay.
**Brhoades**: Yeah.
**Ashton**: And then, you know, just realistically, Jerrica, there hopefully won't be mistakes made by merit.
**Ashton**: Right.
**Ashton**: But living in the real world is, hey, we've got a crane out there and six guys.
**Ashton**: Do you have a design for how you want us to do weld washers?
**Ashton**: If we have to blow holes and move things around, do you think you could get your standard, like, detail of how we.
**Ashton**: How you want us to fix something and how thick the weld washers would have to be?
**Ashton**: You know what I mean?
**Brhoades**: Yeah.
**Brhoades**: So that is kind of tough because it.
**Brhoades**: It depends on what went wrong and what the loads are and how that kind of impacts the design.
**Brhoades**: So I can, like, definitely start compiling some of that information so that we can have a quicker turnaround.
**Ashton**: I've never requested this information this early on a job, but I can definitely say that I'm.
**Ashton**: I don't like putting the structural engineer in a position of, we need this information by the end of the day.
**Ashton**: You know, I mean, on site, and it's just not very fun.
**Ashton**: So I'm trying to make a note of getting ahead of that when I can.
**Brhoades**: Yeah, I appreciate that.
**Brhoades**: I can't tell you how many times I've been in that situation.
**Brhoades**: So.
**Jdawson**: That's me.
**Nbigler**: We're talking about me.
**Jdawson**: Sorry, Jerrica.
**Brhoades**: Thanks, Glenn.
**Brhoades**: Yeah, no, that.
**Brhoades**: That is definitely on our radar, and we appreciate the heads up.
**Awoodhams**: Cool.
**Jdawson**: So design deliverables.
**Jdawson**: I think these are all done Obviously, we talk about fire spare set, structural steel permit set.
**Jdawson**: Still a question mark on when you.
**Nbigler**: Guys are going to have that back, but other than that, everything else has been submitted here and that's it.
**Nbigler**: Does anybody else have anything they want to add in here?
**Nbigler**: Do a site visit, sell the mud?
**Nbigler**: We're pushing.
**Awoodhams**: No.
**Gdesmit**: Appreciate it.
**Jdawson**: All right, guys, see you.
