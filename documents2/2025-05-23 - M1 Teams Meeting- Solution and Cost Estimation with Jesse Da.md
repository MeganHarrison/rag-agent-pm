## Transcript
**Alberto**: I was saying I believe you guys had a meeting previously.
**Alberto**: I wasn't here at that juncture, but I believe you received.
**Armando**: You.
**Alberto**: You had to get permitting or.
**Alberto**: I don't know if it was like a civil engineer before that.
**Alberto**: Armando, do you remember?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Armando**: So I believe last we stood, Jesse, by the way, how are you doing?
**Armando**: We sent a.
**Armando**: I believe it was a bar ballpark square footage cost for each of the units.
**Armando**: Since we didn't have exact details on the type of fixtures, if they had appliances, with or without appliances.
**Armando**: But we had sent over that ballpark over to you just to give you an idea, I guess maybe for budgetary related activities on your side.
**Armando**: And from there we didn't receive a response back.
**Armando**: So I believe you were working on your civil engineering or the planning phase of the project.
**Armando**: Correct.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we are.
**Jdawson**: And I'm just, you know, when I go back to it, I just went to that email.
**Jdawson**: So like these the cost ranges that you sent second?
**Armando**: Sure.
**Armando**: Yeah.
**Armando**: It looks like your image froze there.
**Armando**: Oh, there you go.
**Jdawson**: So the, but the cost range is something that I could build these things, I could build them.
**Jdawson**: I'm doing so many of them, it doesn't make any sense to, to purchase them at that rate, you know, 400 a square foot.
**Jdawson**: You know, that kind of blows my mind because I, you know, I built hospitals for less than that, so.
**Armando**: Right, right.
**Jdawson**: And then when I talk to you, Jeff, again on the follow up you gave, you know, you know, when it's.
**Jdawson**: They're not outfitted with anything.
**Jdawson**: It's simple container with some rough ends for a sink and some electrical outlets for whatever equipment they put in there.
**Jdawson**: But that's, you know, that's all we need.
**Armando**: Consider bleeding down.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, it's not this.
**Jdawson**: I probably didn't get back.
**Jdawson**: It's just because that's such a.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah.
**Armando**: We.
**Armando**: And we did a kitchen for a customer in Tampa and that included all the appliances and the dollar amount for their 40 foot container kind of matched this.
**Armando**: What the square footage was based on all the appliances that they put in there.
**Armando**: But if you're looking for just a bare system, are you asking for a hood installed?
**Armando**: None of that stuff is needed.
**Armando**: Right.
**Armando**: Okay.
**Armando**: And if, if we send you.
**Armando**: I'm trying to see how to, how to do this for the fixtures inside flooring walls.
**Armando**: Do you have an idea of what you want in there?
**Jdawson**: I mean, or if it's FRP on the walls?
**Armando**: Okay.
**Alberto**: You know, very, just a bit, just.
**Armando**: Very basic shell, Right?
**Alberto**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: You know, and I think the look of the outside just has an opening to the door and a couple lights out there.
**Armando**: I believe you also sent us kind of a.
**Armando**: I think there were some, were some images of.
**Armando**: Let me see if I have them.
**Alberto**: So basically what I'm hearing and understanding.
**Jdawson**: Is the only option we have to get this thing done is to scrape.
**Alberto**: It and stabilize it and give you.
**Jdawson**: You know, your minimum coverage, you know, which is using 12 inches above the bottom of the footer.
**Armando**: I mean, I mean, I think we're, I think we're getting a different call.
**Alberto**: Other option is.
**Alberto**: Yeah, I don't know what I'm gathering.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I'm sorry, I'm trying to watch.
**Armando**: Oh yeah, I heard footers and I'm like, oh, we're, we're actively on the same kind of project and like, oh, is that us?
**Armando**: Okay.
**Armando**: But.
**Armando**: Hey, Jeffrey, let's, let's check with our bedroom.
**Jdawson**: We'll do the foundation.
**Armando**: Yeah.
**Armando**: So what we'll do is since no appliances are needed, we have the required units, sizes that you need and the required amounts.
**Armando**: If maybe we can ask Alberto to just do a basic, you know, estimate based on fixtures for a kitchen.
**Armando**: You know, I mean, we don't want to put in, you know, flooring that's going to be mopped up every day and mess up the flooring.
**Armando**: And then drainage, 2 drainage is there frp the regular lights for 40 footer.
**Armando**: What else do they have for the flooring?
**Armando**: Is, is, is an epoxy flooring okay for you?
**Armando**: You want to find vinyl flooring.
**Armando**: Okay, so let's get, let's go back to Alberto on this.
**Armando**: We were, he was under the impression we would be using a, buying the appliances and putting them in there for him.
**Armando**: But let's do just a shell kitchen related thing.
**Jdawson**: You know, a panel outlets, you know, and it may be where we just have the panel and, you know, they'll just come, you know.
**Jdawson**: Well, I mean, we'll coordinate it by.
**Alberto**: That if you need.
**Armando**: Right.
**Armando**: And one of the, one of the challenges that we had was the, the exhaust fans for the hood and the makeup air for the hoods.
**Armando**: Oh, hey, Alberto, how are you?
**Armando**: We have Alberto here, he's our, in our construction group and cost estimation and can definitely ask the right questions for you right now to get those estimates going, but.
**Armando**: Hey, Alberto.
**Armando**: So Jesse would, he's looking for some container kitchens, but he will provide all the, all the appliances including the hood system.
**Armando**: Now he's just looking for a customized unit to put those appliances in there.
**Alberto**: Justin, with that, I have a couple questions.
**Alberto**: So for the host system, what size of host system are you looking for?
**Jdawson**: I sent a map and it shows there's a, there's a range of them.
**Jdawson**: There's 10 foot or 8 by 20 or whatever they are.
**Jdawson**: And then there's a couple of the 40 foot long containers.
**Jdawson**: And then some of them are simply dry storage.
**Jdawson**: Some of them are, they're gonna be cold storage.
**Jdawson**: So it'd be like a refrigerator unit basically.
**Alberto**: Do we have the, a separate one?
**Alberto**: Not in.
**Armando**: What we provided was a square foot cost estimation.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Alberto**: Because the, the issue is that every single unit we pretty much have to design it or if you want the 20 foot usually have two extractors and then one makeup air.
**Alberto**: And then we have to design a way that the makeup area is 10ft away from the extractors and we have to make sure if it's going by the, by the Flora building code and it's going to be a full kitchen.
**Alberto**: There's a lot of items.
**Jdawson**: Some of the coffee shops like.
**Jdawson**: Okay, there's the grant that's a bunch of different.
**Jdawson**: Again, it's on the site plan we sent.
**Jdawson**: You know, there's a legend there that shows, you know, calls out kind of which ones are what.
**Alberto**: Okay, well what I'm saying we have to pretty much design every single unit to give you an accurate estimate of the project.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: What I'm saying is like you could say here our base container is this with VCT floors, FRP on the wall, painted ceiling and just 2 by 4 like or a 4 foot long strip light fixture, a couple of them running down the middle of it.
**Jdawson**: You know, that's that if you have to put a kitchen exhaust load in the, on it's this much extra.
**Jdawson**: That would be the only difference between them is some of them will have a kitchen.
**Jdawson**: Some of them.
**Alberto**: Are you going to have gas appliances or electric appliances?
**Jdawson**: Imagine gas.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Alberto**: Okay.
**Alberto**: And then with that how many gas appliances on each unit?
**Alberto**: Because the problem is that we do very itemized codes.
**Alberto**: We, we don't want to give you like whatever price.
**Alberto**: We, we do a very itemized list of every single material on each unit.
**Alberto**: So what it is, is.
**Jdawson**: So that's the problem.
**Jdawson**: Like we're, we're simply, we're getting started on the civil design and you know, need to get the structural design and then the owner, they, they do their, whatever their agreements are when they bring in all their vendors that are going to have the restaurants there and, and then we'll be able to finalize that design.
**Jdawson**: So that cost will, you know, it comes later.
**Jdawson**: We can't figure that now there's no way to do it.
**Jdawson**: And you was trying to.
**Alberto**: And, and that is when.
**Alberto**: When we come and we can give you a ballpark.
**Alberto**: Same thing that we did before pretty much.
**Alberto**: And then the same way that you said that we can give you a ballpark for the regular unit there and more or less what it would cost to do a whole system.
**Alberto**: And per item.
**Alberto**: I guess we can give you a ballpark.
**Alberto**: I will be per if you want three appliances with gas or four or five because that changes in the amount of pipe that you need, what size and the valve that he has, the closer valve that I need for the fire suppression.
**Alberto**: It's just a lot of items in there that they're expensive items that.
**Alberto**: That could impact me.
**Jdawson**: Plumber couldn't just come in later on after they're there and he would just like our plumber would do that on site.
**Jdawson**: He would just drill a hole through the container on a gas piping and space it to the equipment.
**Alberto**: Yeah, that is a possibility.
**Alberto**: Usually the gas is connected to above connected to the fire suppression system that is on the hood system as well.
**Alberto**: So it's, it's all together on the installation.
**Alberto**: So.
**Alberto**: So that's one of the items there that you have to consider.
**Alberto**: But we can give you more or less a ballpark per gas line.
**Alberto**: I guess if you want to put fire blasting six appliances depending on if you have a 20 foot system it could be much more than that.
**Alberto**: Six, seven appliances.
**Alberto**: But.
**Alberto**: And then with that you can have a ballpark.
**Alberto**: It's still not going to be accurate.
**Alberto**: I can tell you right now that it could, it could vary 50, even 100 depending the actual unit.
**Alberto**: Whenever we start putting stuff in, I mean.
**Jdawson**: We finish up our design and then maybe it is, you know.
**Jdawson**: And that's the other thing is when it comes to inspections, you know is, you know is the plumber.
**Jdawson**: Are you able to get your certified?
**Jdawson**: So they just show up and, and they've been inspected and then code.
**Alberto**: So there's two ways to do it.
**Alberto**: There is the modular building program and then we can build units on site like a regular building.
**Alberto**: So we will have to.
**Alberto**: The modular building program.
**Alberto**: We will have to build the structure from the ground up, submit it to the dvpr, the department of Business and regulations.
**Alberto**: We have specific floor plan and everything and it gets approved by the, by the state and they come here to the factory and do the inspections here and all inspections and then we will receive an insignia that will be on the Panel box.
**Alberto**: So the unit when it comes out of here is certified.
**Alberto**: So the only thing that is done on site is connections and foundation which is the best way to do it.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that's.
**Jdawson**: That's why you know if you give me those itemized prices and then.
**Jdawson**: Then we move through with the design and the owner gets their vendor set up then we can finalize what that is with.
**Alberto**: With the.
**Alberto**: With the modulars also.
**Alberto**: So you know the units look like containers but they're not shipping containers.
**Alberto**: They are made from the ground up to.
**Alberto**: To the specs and to.
**Alberto**: To build as a kitchen or whatever an office.
**Alberto**: And they have peach roof in the middle.
**Alberto**: They like I said they look like chipping containers but they're not.
**Alberto**: They're manufactured from the ground up and we can play with the sizes as well.
**Alberto**: The A kitchen, a full kitchen in a container is very, very tight.
**Alberto**: We have built them before and it's just extremely tight.
**Alberto**: It doesn't make code.
**Alberto**: If you add a table to prep doesn't mean flora building code because of the width.
**Alberto**: And the appliances, full appliances.
**Alberto**: Those are manufactured units.
**Alberto**: They're not shipping containers.
**Alberto**: You can sell from the bottom being into a beam that they're.
**Alberto**: They're made differently.
**Alberto**: They have.
**Alberto**: They look like containers within it.
**Alberto**: They have a peach on the middle.
**Alberto**: If you know the.
**Alberto**: To the.
**Alberto**: To the end they have a gutter system so the water drain properly.
**Alberto**: The shipping containers they have pretty much flat roofs with corrugated.
**Alberto**: So you will eventually have issues with.
**Alberto**: With water staying on the roof.
**Alberto**: If we have problems in the roof that's.
**Alberto**: And then with modular buildings like this one, we could make it any size.
**Alberto**: We can make it 1012 wide instead of the 8 wide container.
**Alberto**: So that.
**Alberto**: That is.
**Alberto**: That will be the difference on going modular.
**Alberto**: We can design the unit to meet floral building code.
**Alberto**: And also specifically to your needs to your size not constrained into the 8 foot Y unit.
**Alberto**: But that's up to you.
**Alberto**: There are a little bit more expensive of course with the bill here in America and built from the ground up.
**Alberto**: But the unit gets out of here with insignia from the.
**Alberto**: From the Florida state certified 180 miles an hour wind.
**Alberto**: So they can be placed any.
**Alberto**: Anywhere in Florida pretty much also going with shipping containers.
**Alberto**: If you're going to go that route we will have to.
**Alberto**: The only thing that we can do here on the factory it will be a structural.
**Alberto**: Pretty much openings the doors the structural openings and maybe framing.
**Alberto**: And then we had to send the unit like that to the site, place it on site and do all the disciplines on site, all the framing, inspection and electrical and plumbing, all the inspections like you would do in a regular building.
**Alberto**: And then after all inspections are done, that we can close the unit and pretty much like a regular construction.
**Alberto**: Now that may benefit you in a way that if you don't have the spaces rented, you can just do the shelving exterior and then have the owner or whoever is renting pay for the interior layout.
**Alberto**: And that's the way to do it.
**Jdawson**: That's what, like these, at these costs, I could easily build them out on site.
**Jdawson**: So that's what I'm looking at is like what is that?
**Jdawson**: It has to make sense.
**Jdawson**: You know, we have a budget trying to meet.
**Jdawson**: So I mean, great, if we could have them built, they're all ready to go when they show up.
**Jdawson**: But I can't.
**Alberto**: It.
**Jdawson**: It just doesn't.
**Alberto**: So talking about that, what is the expected budget per unit that you foresee having for the, for the actual work?
**Jdawson**: You know, I like a.
**Alberto**: Like I.
**Jdawson**: Would say 250A square foot high end.
**Jdawson**: What we would expect.
**Alberto**: Well, what would be the, the actual, the actual budget that you guys are want to stay in and.
**Jdawson**: Well, this whole project is like 3 1/2 to 4 million.
**Alberto**: Of course, that includes everything, you know, all the sign.
**Alberto**: You're probably spending, you know, $80,000 on civil engineer.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, exactly.
**Jdawson**: You know, that covered seating, canopy area, that's going to be probably 7, 800,000.
**Jdawson**: So it's just parking and everything.
**Jdawson**: It adds up.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Alberto**: Yeah.
**Alberto**: I mean, if you, if you give us a ballpark, more specific ballpark of what you want to say, we can build a quote for you as specific materials that we can provide for that pricing and then more or less that we can try to stay within, within that a specific budget.
**Alberto**: It's just so many ways to go on building a unit.
**Alberto**: How are we going to build it?
**Alberto**: If you're going to have metal frames, going to have wood studs, are we doing spray from insulation or about insulation, Are we doing epoxy flooring or we can do BCT flooring.
**Alberto**: What, what, you know, FRP on walls without frp, just regular drywall.
**Alberto**: It's just so many ways we can reconfigure the actual structure to me flooring a building code to make your specs and then just try to meet the budget.
**Alberto**: But if you don't, if we don't have any budget, we, we kind of go blind and do a.
**Alberto**: What we think should be best but not necessarily good for your budget or, you know.
**Alberto**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: How much this like the budget you sent included all the kitchen equipment.
**Jdawson**: Like how much of that is the equipment you planned on putting or figured on putting, having it provide.
**Alberto**: So give me one second.
**Alberto**: So can you, Armando, can you, can you post that kitchen that we did for Khaled so he can.
**Alberto**: Well, let's see.
**Alberto**: It's a full kitchen with a 20ft range, a hood wrench to give you more or less what something like that will cost without appliances, including the hood, but without, without appliance and let me get to it.
**Alberto**: All right, so the next picture.
**Alberto**: So this has a 20 foot commercial hood range system with six gas outlets for different appliances.
**Alberto**: Sink.
**Alberto**: It has drain drains on the four, five drains on the floor, one for the one bigger drain.
**Alberto**: Two exhaust fans on each and then one makeup bear going inside.
**Alberto**: It has the stainless steel on the wall, the cooking wall and it has FRP on the rest of the walls.
**Jdawson**: I don't see.
**Jdawson**: I can't imagine they would and anything like that.
**Jdawson**: We're building an facility restaurant in here in Indiana where they have like six in interior.
**Jdawson**: It's like a volleyball restaurant complex.
**Jdawson**: And they're all just small kitchens.
**Jdawson**: They got one small hood about four foot long.
**Jdawson**: You know, that's the type of food vendors they have.
**Alberto**: Okay so that one is with a 1220 foot kitchen range with the system pretty much two doors.
**Alberto**: And this is what I'm talking about the limitations on the square footage.
**Alberto**: That table there pretty much had to be removed for inspection because didn't make call for inspection.
**Alberto**: You need to have at least 36 inches.
**Alberto**: But they, they wanted it there for prepping but it's just too tight when it's a container to have a configuration like that.
**Alberto**: It's, it worked for, for them for the purpose that they're doing.
**Alberto**: It was temporary kitchen pretty much for.
**Alberto**: Because they were built, building their, their full commercial kitchen.
**Alberto**: So it's working, still working at the moment.
**Alberto**: They, they're using it while they build their full kitchen.
**Alberto**: But it, it's just for.
**Alberto**: I would Recommend at least 10ft wide unit to be able to, you know, to have space, be able to cook and you know, serve properly.
**Alberto**: You can have pop up windows on one side and for disturbing for you know and all the things.
**Alberto**: So that will be on the design that will be this type of unit.
**Alberto**: Can you go to the, the one that we just did for ltg, you have those pictures.
**Alberto**: That one is for the Miami College.
**Armando**: This is an office which, which you do have in your, in your.
**Armando**: I believe it's a.
**Armando**: I'll look for it.
**Alberto**: But you have.
**Alberto**: It will be for kind of like a coffee bar probably or something like that with pop up windows and.
**Alberto**: And some come on and so basically yeah.
**Alberto**: Can you put those pictures?
**Alberto**: So this is a unit we had to do one higher than the other the counter because for handicap.
**Alberto**: But this is a unit that has shoulders for.
**Alberto**: It's a Miami day approved.
**Alberto**: So we had to put shutters and then also has.
**Alberto**: After you open the shoulders then you have pop up windows that go out.
**Alberto**: Go up for the shade pretty much.
**Alberto**: Can you put the inside.
**Alberto**: The inside is just a FRP unit with this epoxy flooring and a sink.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Well I gotta walk the side here with the owner.
**Alberto**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: But I'm gonna get you.
**Jdawson**: I'm gonna look at some.
**Jdawson**: What we need to budget and then see what our options are.
**Jdawson**: And you know, maybe like even just having the container delivered like that like you say.
**Jdawson**: And then we just have an on site person.
**Alberto**: So just here this container was done that way.
**Alberto**: We had to deliver as it is right now with pretty much open.
**Alberto**: Can you put the inside the last picture there?
**Alberto**: It'll be delivered pretty much spray for insulation, metal studs.
**Alberto**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: How much is that?
**Alberto**: Yeah, we can have all the electrical like that.
**Alberto**: And then all the inspection has to be done on site.
**Alberto**: Pretty much.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that's.
**Jdawson**: And like if that had a VCT floor even looks like epoxy.
**Alberto**: Like this one is epoxy for.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Now we're getting dwell where we could order them and have them delivered.
**Jdawson**: If they had to move some things around for whatever the kitchen configuration was.
**Jdawson**: I can do it.
**Alberto**: So that would be I guess the ideal way to just have it up to this stage.
**Alberto**: Yeah.
**Alberto**: And then you can.
**Alberto**: If you want to add any.
**Alberto**: Whatever you have to add more.
**Alberto**: More electrical or then you will probably have to change in the drawings adding the.
**Alberto**: The different breakers and things.
**Alberto**: But you know it's.
**Alberto**: It's doable.
**Alberto**: It's open.
**Alberto**: So that.
**Alberto**: That would be the other way to go.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Alberto**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: Price me up.
**Jdawson**: Something like that.
**Alberto**: Right.
**Alberto**: And you have the famous product there.
**Alberto**: So I.
**Alberto**: I know he has to go.
**Alberto**: But the last pictures.
**Armando**: Which one?
**Armando**: Sorry, Alberto.
**Alberto**: What once is the place on site.
**Armando**: Oh, okay.
**Armando**: Trying to find those.
**Armando**: This was the one placed on site.
**Alberto**: But give me one second, I'll say something.
**Armando**: Okay.
**Armando**: Oh, maybe it's these.
**Alberto**: I.
**Alberto**: I just sent you some.
**Alberto**: So.
**Alberto**: Yeah, that was already placed inside that unit with the electrical hookup.
**Alberto**: And can you get to the interior so you can see the interior?
**Alberto**: It's pretty much finished FRP walls, resist lighting.
**Alberto**: You know, it's regular unit.
**Alberto**: Then you can add your tables or anything else that you want.
**Alberto**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: All right, well, I have to go here, but.
**Armando**: So you're looking for just basic shell.
**Jdawson**: Just basic?
**Armando**: Yeah.
**Alberto**: All right, we'll.
**Alberto**: We'll give you a quote like that, I guess, sending you the unit just with the framing and basic electrical and.
**Alberto**: And.
**Alberto**: And then we'll go from there.
**Alberto**: You can let us know why you want to move or if you want to add something.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: Thank you.
**Alberto**: All right.
**Alberto**: All right.
**Alberto**: Thank you.
**Alberto**: Bye.
**Alberto**: Thank you.
**Armando**: Hey, Jeffrey.
**Armando**: Yeah, hold on.
**Armando**: Give me one second while I stop recording here.
**Armando**: Okay, so.
**Alberto**: Okay, one moment.
**Armando**: Just.
