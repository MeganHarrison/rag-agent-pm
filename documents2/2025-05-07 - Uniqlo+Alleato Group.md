**Aelkarrimy**: On saw the contract I sent back over.
**Bclymer**: Yes, yes, I got that.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And in our system I was going to ask you like who like accounting wise, is it your company that should receive like billings and things like that?
**Aelkarrimy**: It's our accounts payable.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: If you can just email me.
**Aelkarrimy**: You need to know where to send the billing itself.
**Bclymer**: Well, I think they just need a person in the system like.
**Bclymer**: Oh, like a name in a contract.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, name contact for that we have.
**Aelkarrimy**: Like a general inbox.
**Aelkarrimy**: Let's name.
**Aelkarrimy**: I don't need to apply to you.
**Bclymer**: Sara.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay, just send it over to you.
**Bclymer**: Okay, thanks.
**Jdawson**: No.
**Kevin.ly**: What?
**Bclymer**: Brandon's going to be a little late.
**Bclymer**: He had okay.
**Bclymer**: Some sort of meeting keeps going to.
**Bclymer**: But.
**Aelkarrimy**: The question I was asked.
**Aelkarrimy**: Maybe I'll wait for him to join before asking then.
**Bclymer**: I'm sorry, what was that?
**Aelkarrimy**: It's the contract I sent over on Tuesday morning.
**Aelkarrimy**: I was wondering if your team is saw it and is working on reviewing.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: I guess we get started here.
**Bclymer**: I don't know.
**Bclymer**: Is there an agenda for this meeting or is it we waiting for some of the joint.
**Aelkarrimy**: Ahmed, do you have a agenda for the meeting?
**Jdawson**: No, I do not.
**Jdawson**: Does the Aliato team have the agenda?
**Bclymer**: Well, I don't have one, but I guess we can get into.
**Bclymer**: I guess anything you guys want to start with.
**Bclymer**: I know you know the permit, the building department.
**Bclymer**: We contacted all our subs.
**Bclymer**: They're overnighting the sprinkler sub had actually turned his in already.
**Bclymer**: But he said they.
**Bclymer**: That department's known to lose information on occasion.
**Bclymer**: So he's going to take it back and the other two are going to overnight theirs.
**Bclymer**: So in a day or two they should be all into the building department.
**Mparsons**: Awesome.
**Jdawson**: Basically with my discussion with Eileen from the dob, once we get that information in, it'll.
**Jdawson**: It'll encourage them to turn around permit faster.
**Jdawson**: So right now they're giving me the standard 20 days.
**Jdawson**: But she said as soon as you guys get that information to call back and she'll give me a better timeline.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: All right.
**Bclymer**: Another thing was about the temp fence.
**Bclymer**: So speaking with our that contractor for that they're going to try to get in there end of next week or the following week and they should be able to do it in two to three days.
**Jdawson**: So I just have one quick thing to bring up.
**Jdawson**: Where is it?
**Mparsons**: Uniqlo, where are you?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah, drawings out.
**Mparsons**: Uniqlo.
**Mparsons**: It just explained January.
**Jdawson**: No, it's this one.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: All right.
**Jdawson**: So basically something minor just changed.
**Jdawson**: Where the g.
**Jdawson**: There was A previous tenant here and they basically moved out.
**Jdawson**: And what the team on site did was basically maintain their previous fencing that did this.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And it basically stops midway and then it kicks over like that.
**Jdawson**: So essentially there would be a little bit of a savings here when it comes to the fencing.
**Jdawson**: So you guys can eliminate basically this entire run.
**Jdawson**: And I think once Yusuke joins the call, he can show you guys some pictures of the site and they're revised.
**Jdawson**: Basically logistics plan just showing how this is existing.
**Jdawson**: So we would just need to deliver everything else with exception to that.
**Jdawson**: This red piece.
**Bclymer**: Okay, that's good to know.
**Bclymer**: I'll let them.
**Bclymer**: These guys know that.
**Bclymer**: Is that something you could email?
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: I just need once you suke online.
**Jdawson**: Is he.
**Bryan.wagar**: Is he on the call?
**Mparsons**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Hey you Suke.
**Jdawson**: Can you just send me that diagram that you and I kind of went through where it shows the.
**Jdawson**: That that that previous tenants fence and where it stops.
**Jdawson**: So I can just revise the logistics plan and I can send that out to the Aliato team.
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay, give me a second.
**Bryan.wagar**: Let me search the fence layout.
**Bryan.wagar**: Give me a second.
**Bryan.wagar**: You can just continue the other topics.
**Bryan.wagar**: I need like few minutes to so research.
**Jdawson**: Well, I really don't have much to discuss and I don't think the Aliato team have much to discuss.
**Jdawson**: They're.
**Jdawson**: They're ironing out the fencing so they're trying to get that in as soon as possible.
**Jdawson**: We're waiting for the permits.
**Jdawson**: We just found out that they will be overnighting all of the general contractor license information and whatnot.
**Jdawson**: So once all of that information is with the DOB next week, on Monday or Tuesday, I'll give the DOB another call and just see where we're at.
**Jdawson**: But other than that, you.
**Jdawson**: I'm not sure if there's anything else you want to discuss right now on this call.
**Bryan.wagar**: How about the trade?
**Bryan.wagar**: Trade?
**Bryan.wagar**: Trade contractor.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So that's.
**Jdawson**: That's the one I just.
**Jdawson**: That's the one I just touched on.
**Jdawson**: So they're.
**Jdawson**: They're overnighting their information to the DoB and then on Monday or Tuesday I will call the DOB back again and just gather what the status is.
**Bryan.wagar**: So is there any problem on the schedule wise?
**Bclymer**: I don't believe so.
**Bclymer**: We're, like I said, we're trying to get the temp.
**Bclymer**: The temp fence.
**Bclymer**: They look to start either next Friday or the following Monday.
**Bclymer**: And it's like two to three days for them to put all that fence in.
**Bclymer**: And it looks like if we are reducing that a little, that'll Help.
**Bclymer**: So for sure you said.
**Bclymer**: I'm sure they can knock that out in just two days.
**Bryan.wagar**: Sorry, sorry, what did you say?
**Bryan.wagar**: Fence installation will start on either Friday.
**Bclymer**: Of next week or the following Monday.
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay, when is the mobilization date for you guys?
**Bclymer**: So I got to get with.
**Bclymer**: With Brandon, but it.
**Bclymer**: The mobilization, you know, 519.
**Bclymer**: The.
**Bclymer**: Well, that kind of depends because our electricians were going to get in there.
**Bclymer**: I think Brandon updated the schedule and sent it out.
**Bclymer**: See here?
**Mparsons**: Yeah.
**Mparsons**: I'm looking at the revised one that Brandon sent out.
**Mparsons**: It shows here that site mobilization will be 519.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, see.
**Bryan.wagar**: We received a revised schedule from Brendan last night.
**Bryan.wagar**: Last.
**Mparsons**: Today, this afternoon.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah.
**Mparsons**: Three.
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: I know we're, we're getting all the sprinkler piping ordered.
**Bclymer**: So that's, you know, we're just reviewing the order that they're placing and just making sure it works with all of the racking and getting that ordered.
**Bclymer**: Our electrician has most of this equipment, the gear and panels in stock.
**Bclymer**: So that shouldn't be a problem.
**Bclymer**: And really that's our main things.
**Bclymer**: I got the submittal today on the.
**Bclymer**: From the plumber for their piping on the permit drawing they'd added in an oil water separator into that drain system.
**Bclymer**: I don't know if that.
**Bclymer**: I guess it's code required.
**Kevin.ly**: That.
**Kevin.ly**: That is a code item.
**Kevin.ly**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so I got that in the submittal package.
**Bclymer**: We just gotta review that and we'll get that sent into the design team to take a look at.
**Mparsons**: Jesse, how are we, how are we proceeding with shop drawings?
**Mparsons**: Are we emailing them or are we using some sort of a platform, a plan.
**Bclymer**: That you know, if we can get you guys into job planner, we can add you and that way we can transfer the files through that.
**Bclymer**: So if you could email me like the main person that shop drawings would go to for each, you know, electrical or fire sprinkler or plumbing, and then we can make sure that they'll receive that through there and it allows you to share big files and we can track it that way.
**Mparsons**: Yeah, so I'll, I'll gather that information from Brian and John from AUE and then also from Joe from Exotech.
**Mparsons**: I'll get you at least a clear email, clean cut email that says the contact that the person that the shop drawing should go to.
**Mparsons**: And like if there's like a certain flow we want to maintain, I'll send all of that to you hopefully by tomorrow in the morning.
**Bclymer**: Okay, perfect.
**Kevin.ly**: Jesse, you mentioned that your ec.
**Kevin.ly**: Sorry Suk.
**Kevin.ly**: Real Quick, you mentioned here EC has most of the electrical equipment in, in stock.
**Kevin.ly**: Does that include the 400 volt transformers or are those gonna have to be a special order?
**Bclymer**: I'll have to check with them on that.
**Bclymer**: I know I knew the panels because we need those, you know, first, but I'll check on that.
**Bclymer**: I don't think it's a big lead time on transformers anymore.
**Bclymer**: From talking to him, he said they're not hard to get.
**Kevin.ly**: Like, the only reason I ask is because I know there's potentially some changes coming from Exotech that will be included in a bulletin here in the near future.
**Kevin.ly**: So I don't want us to get too far ahead where we cause any issues with equipment on, on those orders.
**Bclymer**: Okay, yeah, that's good to know.
**Bclymer**: I'll let them know.
**Bclymer**: And as it.
**Bclymer**: As far as the voltage is changing or the size.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Here, I can, I can actually send all those over.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: We shouldn't have any changes moving forward.
**Kevin.ly**: So everything's going to remain the same, Joe?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: No.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Well, I'm going to send out the final, the final documentation that was actually signed off by Uniqlo.
**Kevin.ly**: Okay, so I guess question one, if you can answer, would be were you able to get a manufacturer that can provide 480 volt, or are we sticking with 400 volt on all those?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: It's 400, unfortunately.
**Kevin.ly**: Okay, so that answers part of that question, Jesse, that the voltage will remain the same, but we may have some, some minor size changes.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: Joe, how soon can you get that information over to us?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I'm.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I'm pulling it up right now and I will copy.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I will put it here.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I'm just going to reply all to the invite, if that's okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah.
**Kevin.ly**: And Joe, does that include all the wrapping or the, the third party equipment.
**Bclymer**: The.
**Kevin.ly**: Cardboard erectors, all that kind of stuff?
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Kevin.ly**: Is that all finalized now?
**Bclymer**: Okay, not we, you know, we sent out those added outlets, I believe, you know that drawing.
**Bclymer**: Is that going to be like finalized in this drawing coming out too?
**Mparsons**: Correct?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah.
**Mparsons**: So that's where architecturally speaking, we'll add those finalized locations based off of this, the latest skypath layout.
**Mparsons**: And then the electrical portions will be updated by Henderson for the loads and whatever the modifications are based off of this revision.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: All right, Brian, if you can, as soon as Joe sends that information and Aaron too, if you guys see anything.
**Jdawson**: That'S glaring, just please alert us right away.
**Mparsons**: This way we can kind of set the tone with the timeline to turn around the bulletin.
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay, sounds good.
**Kevin.ly**: Yep, same here.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Well, it's sent.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Everybody should have it in their inbox in just a minute.
**Mparsons**: Thanks, Joe.
**Mparsons**: Jesse, your team received the latest comments from the Uniqlo's legal team for the contract?
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, Brandon's currently reviewing that, so I would expect if there is any responses and we'll get that back to you this week.
**Bclymer**: Brandon will be here tomorrow and St.
**Bclymer**: Pete, so I'll look over that with him.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And.
**Mparsons**: Joe, is there a drawing though for the power outlet locations relative to the Skypath?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Is that not in it?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Power?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: There it is.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: There is no drawing.
**Mparsons**: Joe, don't hate me for this man, but I also need a DWG of that Skypath so I can plug that into the backgrounds for the consultants as well.
**Mparsons**: And then this way we can actually show the actual location of those convenience outlets.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay, you need a drawing of all the Skypath and everything.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay, I can, I can definitely get that to you.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: We've had the layout signed off on as well.
**Jdawson**: And you know, you could tell, you could tell that gentleman if he could just keep the outline of the fence just like a rectangle.
**Mparsons**: This way I could just pick it.
**Jdawson**: Up by base point and I can create a block for it so it's not too heavy.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah, all the stuff we've been sending is pretty large.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Because I know he's going to have an issue with that because that's where we always had the like, all the dots and like the motors were just like everything was just all broken up.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so we'll wait, we'll wait for that sketch to come in with a DWG and then we'll issue an email to the team just letting everyone know.
**Jdawson**: Once Henderson, AUE and TPG kind of review internally the duration it will take.
**Mparsons**: For us to just turn around a.
**Jdawson**: Quick bulletin and if a narrative is required just so we can get the ball moving so we can order some things and get shop drawings sooner and sooner rather than later.
**Jdawson**: We'll try to send emails out accordingly.
**Bclymer**: One thing back to the fence.
**Bclymer**: So is it your.
**Bclymer**: Do you need this fence?
**Bclymer**: I know there was.
**Bclymer**: I kind of remember back and forth about actually tap conning it to the floor or letting the stands support the fence since it's temporary.
**Bclymer**: Like what do you want in that install?
**Jdawson**: I mean, I think in the bid what we said was that we would prefer that we don't have mounting, but if you need to go 10 foot with a 10 foot fence, I can't imagine how wide this platform is going to be, which will eat from the path of like where all the skyjacks are going to go and the maintenance tools are going to be traveling through.
**Jdawson**: So if the platform is going to be a problem.
**Jdawson**: In the bids we did include the line item that if you guys can't achieve the 10 foot fence the way that it's shown, then let's go with the bolting into the slab and to add an allowance for the concrete patching after we remove the temporary fence.
**Jdawson**: So you have the option of this or that.
**Jdawson**: Whatever is within the price range that you guys bid on.
**Jdawson**: We should be okay.
**Mparsons**: And just keep in mind security, you.
**Jdawson**: Know, like they're worried about security as well.
**Jdawson**: So if the fence on a platform or like, like with a base is shiftable and someone can like break into the area of work, I would assume we would rather have the bolting.
**Jdawson**: But if you guys feel that they can be fastened very well side by side, then whatever, whatever is easier.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: Yusuke, were you going to say something?
**Bryan.wagar**: But you have to be keep 10ft height.
**Mparsons**: They.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I just, yeah, I just basically said that.
**Bclymer**: Okay, well.
**Bryan.wagar**: And Jesse, the, the red part is for the fencing area you have to prepare and blue one is already there because we are dividing remark the sublease area.
**Bclymer**: But did they, did they actually put in a ten foot high fence?
**Bclymer**: Yes, yes it is.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: But that one's bolted, Jesse.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bryan.wagar**: And please make sure the green line is for like some kind of special open and closed gate for like putting this stuff.
**Bclymer**: So that's you know, with the, the way we had priced like these fence panels.
**Bclymer**: So if you bolt the, you know, the, the piece down then you can, you can swing the gate out because it'll hold itself up.
**Bclymer**: And then you know we can put a chain or lock or whatever at each opening that you want to be made is that, that's the securing method that will work.
**Bryan.wagar**: So partially you're bolting, bolting the gate.
**Bclymer**: Well, the, the.
**Bclymer**: These like a gate stand from like a temp bent is a, you know, it's a panel that sets on the stands and then that's bolted down.
**Bclymer**: So then you know it can pivot on the posts that are on those stands.
**Mparsons**: So yeah, if you guys want to mix, if you want to mix and match bolted versus not bolted.
**Mparsons**: So then at the gated areas we, if it's required to have those posts then definitely go with the bolting at the gates areas.
**Mparsons**: And if you feel that enabled body won't be able to go between two panels on the long runs.
**Mparsons**: If it's, if it's chained properly with Like a very tight radius.
**Mparsons**: Then I think you guys are okay with that too.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I mean the panels it.
**Bclymer**: So I have to have a tool set to take them apart to get in between the panels.
**Bclymer**: You know, they're all bolted together with clips.
**Bclymer**: I'll have to see.
**Bclymer**: Do you have any photos of the fence that's there by any chance?
**Mparsons**: You suka.
**Mparsons**: You had that picture the other day when you and I were on the call of when they cleaned up the whole area that we're going to work in.
**Mparsons**: Can you share that on the screen?
**Bryan.wagar**: The photo.
**Bryan.wagar**: Just a photo of the floor.
**Jdawson**: Just a photo of the warehouse cleaned.
**Jdawson**: And it showed.
**Mparsons**: It showed that white fence in the back.
**Bryan.wagar**: Oh, give me a sec.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Are you just trying to see the fence?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I was just curious to what.
**Bclymer**: What it was that they installed.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: This is here.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: There you go.
**Bryan.wagar**: Oh, thanks.
**Bryan.wagar**: Joe.
**Bryan.wagar**: Can you share the screen?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I put it in the chat?
**Mparsons**: Yes, I can.
**Mparsons**: Can you.
**Mparsons**: Can I share my actual chat?
**Bclymer**: I see it also.
**Bclymer**: They put in like a site fence.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Mparsons**: But you can see like they have it bolted on this.
**Mparsons**: On the.
**Mparsons**: On the slab itself.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Like it's.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: It's bolted to the ground.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: It's.
**Bclymer**: They have like a windscreen on there too.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I mean that's them.
**Jdawson**: They had a privacy screen.
**Jdawson**: It's privacy into their area.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Mparsons**: That basically happens where this red area happens.
**Mparsons**: But the only question is Yusuke, is where.
**Mparsons**: What column line does it stop at?
**Mparsons**: Because I'm.
**Mparsons**: I'm not sure.
**Mparsons**: So that's what I need from you.
**Mparsons**: This will just define where it stops and then I can send a revised sketch out to the team.
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay.
**Bryan.wagar**: Location.
**Bryan.wagar**: Understand.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I'll include.
**Bryan.wagar**: Oh, just that you have it?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah, I'll include it on my.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: On the drawing that I give you and it will be.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: It will be exact.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Actually these are why I have pictures of it.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Because I was actually taking measurements to include it in our drawings.
**Bclymer**: So we have to inform.
**Bryan.wagar**: Inform.
**Bryan.wagar**: We auto that the other.
**Bryan.wagar**: The.
**Bryan.wagar**: The fence they going to prepare.
**Bryan.wagar**: So just as we have only for the row market the exact location of the fence, right?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah, it'll be exact.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: But I can give you my.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I can give you a quick note of that one line when I was messaging my team to draw it.
**Bclymer**: And did you.
**Bclymer**: I didn't notice any dimensions to where that temp fence goes.
**Bclymer**: Will you be able to put that on there for the rest of it?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah.
**Bryan.wagar**: So.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: It'S not what seem to be drawn in.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So just a few notes that I took it.
**Bclymer**: The.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I mean I don't know if you need it right now?
**Jdawson**: No, I don't need it right now, man.
**Jdawson**: Just send it tomorrow.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I can send you the notes that I put in what I'll do the bottom.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So basically that those columns that you see along the long side is column 30.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So and then it turns here.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I could show you here.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I'll just post this.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: It's handwritten, but I think you guys are all can decipher.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And then that turns right in between, in the middle saw cut in between H and J.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: It's like perfectly in the center.
**Mparsons**: H and J.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: All right.
**Mparsons**: Yeah, I'll.
**Mparsons**: I'll try to input that.
**Mparsons**: And Jesse, what I'll do is give.
**Jdawson**: You the full dimensions of the entire fencing.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Including like the runs of the gates and everything.
**Mparsons**: So you'll have a full sketch hopefully tomorrow by end of day.
**Mparsons**: I could put all that together for you.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bryan.wagar**: Joseph, I wanted to confirm about the cog rework.
**Bryan.wagar**: You have to do the friction test again, right?
**Mparsons**: Yeah.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I sent you an email right before this like right before the meeting started.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: They actually sent their report or the initial report.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I don't know how to read it.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So I asked when's their earliest time that they can do a.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: They can do a later here, here on East Coast.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: A later meeting that they can go over what these.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: What it actually means.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: It's a.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: It's a hundred page report.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So they need to simplify it for us a little bit, which they will do.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And they said that the machine that does the friction test is out of customs.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: They're just waiting for transport now for basically for just to get it mailed home.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So they're going to get it in Atlanta.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Once they have it in Atlanta in hand, they'll schedule somebody to.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: To come out the site and I'll definitely give you a heads up.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: But it's only about a two to three hour that they need to complete.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And then you know it'll.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: They'll probably come out, do the test and then fly right back.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: It'll be a one day trip.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Bryan.wagar**: So the report is not including the test of the friction.
**Bryan.wagar**: They have to add it after.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yes.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So the friction test.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: The friction test in itself is basically going to be a pass or fail.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: It's either going to be the floor is too slick or the floor is fine.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: There's not going to be an in between.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So we know we have to remediate on based on just dips in the concrete.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: It this friction test is just basically do we need to go over the Entire area with a light sanding in simple terms or not.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: You know.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So we still need the full, we still need explanation on the full report.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: But no, this, it does not include the.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: The friction test as of yet.
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay.
**Bryan.wagar**: They also put the estimation cost for remediation too in the report.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: The estimation is not in it.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: He said this is.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: They have just the report and then right now they're compiling the remediation plan.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And that will have the estimate.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So you should have that.
**Bryan.wagar**: How about the schedule?
**Bryan.wagar**: Like remediation schedule also?
**Bryan.wagar**: They're going to explain us in the meeting.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yes, yes.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And that.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: That's what I want them to explain.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I don't want to decipher the.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: The you know, 100 pages that they sent out.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: They still have to put together their.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: They do like a heat graph again.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: You look.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Look through it and see.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: You know, it does have.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: It does have a.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: A legend that, you know, it helps you.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I was kind of, you know, looking at it today.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: It.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: It.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: To be honest, from what I'm looking at, it doesn't look too bad.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So I, I'm really excited to hear what they have to say.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So I'm waiting to hear back from Michael on and I'm gonna.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I told him to make when he's available for like a late meeting that we can do like a seven o' clock.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I'm hoping he says tomorrow.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: If not, maybe Monday night.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: If not Tuesday morning for you.
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay.
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay.
**Bryan.wagar**: And also we have to include the Calgary remediation schedule into the overall schedule which Brandon shares.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yes, which.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Which right now we have scheduled for the first week of June, I believe.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: First or second week.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, first.
**Bryan.wagar**: First week.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yes, yes.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Bryan.wagar**: And as of now they put like one month per remediation plan in the overall schedule.
**Bryan.wagar**: But I don't think it will take that much of time.
**Bryan.wagar**: So.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah, on my first glance, it does not look like it will take that much time at all.
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay.
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay.
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay.
**Bryan.wagar**: And also we have to make sure that it won't affect you.
**Bryan.wagar**: The construction of the network Damian's doing right now.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And that was kind of my question to your email.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I didn't quite understand what the.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: What the.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: You said there was a conflict with the network construction.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I didn't understand that.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Bryan.wagar**: Schedule is overlapping to each other.
**Bryan.wagar**: Network construction and the remedy.
**Bryan.wagar**: And the friction test.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah, no, that'll be.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: That, that'll be fine.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: They don't need the whole area to do the friction test.
**Jdawson**: That.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: That's not a.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: That's not a problem whatsoever.
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay.
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Basically, they're gonna.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: They're gonna eyeball.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I mean, I'll let them explain it, but they're gonna do a couple areas that look.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Basically you could see what's the shiniest.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And they'll.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: They'll test, you know, I don't know how the test works.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Obviously the machine does it for them, but they will test, you know, how much.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Whatever the.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I don't even know what the measurement is that tells you what the friction of the floor is.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So I imagine they do that in just several different areas.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: If there's people working, they're obviously not going to go walking in that area, but they don't need the whole floor like they did for the survey.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Really?
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah, yeah.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: You're just doing network stuff.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: There's a lot of space out there.
**Bryan.wagar**: Oh, you got it.
**Bryan.wagar**: Thank you.
**Bryan.wagar**: And Ahmed, I'll call.
**Bryan.wagar**: I will call you back for checking the Brandon schedule together.
**Bryan.wagar**: Is that okay for you?
**Bryan.wagar**: Maybe today is too late for you, so maybe tomorrow.
**Mparsons**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Did you have some questions on it?
**Jdawson**: You.
**Bryan.wagar**: Know, I haven't seen yet.
**Bschwartz**: Oh, you didn't see the email or you haven't got a chance to review it yet?
**Mparsons**: No, he just hasn't had a chance to review the actual schedule.
**Mparsons**: But one thing, Brandon, that I'm working.
**Jdawson**: On gathering for you, which I don't see in the schedule, is like calling.
**Mparsons**: The special inspections and the state inspections.
**Jdawson**: So those we need to kind of plug them in and give them somewhat of a guesstimate of when do we anticipate that?
**Jdawson**: Because one thing that the special inspection agencies are asking is, do we have a construction timeline and where do they fall within it?
**Jdawson**: So I let them know that once we have that all ironed out, we'll be able to share that.
**Jdawson**: So I'll kind of review it tomorrow with you, Suk, and then I'll kind of send you an email just letting you know these are the required inspections and these are the controlled inspections.
**Jdawson**: There are periodic ones, but we don't want them to come every single day.
**Jdawson**: So I did speak to some of them where I told them, hey, like, once we're done with the first row of racks, can you guys come in, review, do your inspection, and if it looks all good, then he'll approve that means and methods and that application, and then you guys can cruise along through Skypod B.
**Jdawson**: Once we're done with Skypod B, they come in and they check the rest of the racks that they didn't check previously.
**Jdawson**: So then this way we kind of limit how many Times really have them on site.
**Jdawson**: But as soon as we kind of iron those inspections list and like I'll supply them to you and then I'll need that schedule somewhat massage just to show where they would fall and then we'll share that with them accordingly.
**Bschwartz**: Yeah, yeah, we'll, we'll put plugs in.
**Bschwartz**: I mean they're going to come in just during that racking A and racking B and they're going to see a bulk get drilled hole, check it and then come in and torque test 5%, you know, at the end.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I, I, I, I honestly just see four visits.
**Bschwartz**: Yeah, there won't cross.
**Bschwartz**: There won't.
**Bschwartz**: Yeah, there won't be very many at all.
**Bschwartz**: Like all they have to do is just see the complete process once and then after that when it's done, they'll come in and torque test.
**Bschwartz**: It's like usually 5% randomly.
**Mparsons**: No, I agree.
**Mparsons**: I got you.
**Bschwartz**: But other than that, as Yuzuki I mean the only thing that we added on the schedule was just the end dates that we talked about last time.
**Bschwartz**: So I plugged in, you know, our final inspection date and then our demo date, taking the fence down and then the go live date for the SOTEC system.
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay.
**Bryan.wagar**: Anyway, let me go through the schedule with it and comment you back for that.
**Bschwartz**: Sounds good.
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay.
**Bryan.wagar**: And how's it going for the review for the contract documents?
**Bryan.wagar**: Is it?
**Bschwartz**: Yeah, so one of the, one of the, so one of the requests was an updated schedule.
**Bschwartz**: So I was just waiting on Joe and I had a meeting this afternoon and firmed up those dates.
**Bschwartz**: So I'll respond back here now that I have that say.
**Bschwartz**: All right, here's the updated schedule that we can include and then I'll here's the rest of the comments on it.
**Bschwartz**: So that way we have one response instead of two.
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay, so if the schedule is fixed, we can just go, go for the offshore contract side.
**Bschwartz**: Yeah, yeah.
**Bschwartz**: So yeah, so I'll respond back to the email with here's the schedule and I'll double check all the markups that the attorney sent over and.
**Bschwartz**: Yeah.
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay, so first of all, I'll go through the schedule with Amit.
**Bryan.wagar**: I mean, I'm good.
**Mparsons**: Awesome.
**Jdawson**: I'm good on my end.
**Jdawson**: Brian and Aaron, anything on your end?
**Bclymer**: No.
**Kevin.ly**: Sarily for this call.
**Kevin.ly**: Ahmed, I think if we can potentially set up a call ahead of the that bulletin one issue so we can just kind of run through some of the changes with Ex Attack, that'd be probably a good idea.
**Kevin.ly**: Otherwise we can certainly discuss them on this call if you want to.
**Jdawson**: I mean, once.
**Mparsons**: Once.
**Jdawson**: I just have all the drawings from Joe.
**Jdawson**: I'll also just have the background prepped.
**Jdawson**: And then once we have the background prep, before I issue the backgrounds back out to everyone, we'll have that call go through, we'll cross T's, and then we'll.
**Jdawson**: We'll just start the ticking from there.
**Mparsons**: For the bulletin issuance.
**Kevin.ly**: Sounds good.
**Jdawson**: Joe.
**Jdawson**: Anything on your end?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: No, that's.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: That's all I got.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I'm trying to.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I'm actually trying to get you that layout right now.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I hopefully will have it in the next coup of minutes.
**Jdawson**: I appreciate you, man.
**Jdawson**: All right, well, I guess we're good now, Brendan.
**Bclymer**: Cool.
**Bryan.wagar**: Alrighty.
**Bclymer**: Well, thanks, everyone.
**Bclymer**: Thank you.
**Bclymer**: Thank you.
**Kevin.ly**: Thanks, all.
**Bryan.wagar**: Thank you.
**Jdawson**: Sam.
