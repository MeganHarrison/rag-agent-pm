**Josmendez.m**: Excuse me?
**Bclymer**: How.
**Bclymer**: What is your process for getting approvals for invoices?
**Josmendez.m**: Oh, well, I have different invokes into my outlook because we received every single invoice through Outlook coming from the vendors.
**Josmendez.m**: So select an invoice according to the information that the invoice have.
**Josmendez.m**: For example, if some invoice doesn't show the project, I need to contact to my manager to the owner of the project.
**Josmendez.m**: So to clarify the specific project, this invoice needs to be processed.
**Josmendez.m**: That's the way we process every single invoice.
**Josmendez.m**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: How would you handle if a project manager is not being responsive?
**Bclymer**: How.

**Josmendez.m**: I contact either the project manager or my financial director.
**Josmendez.m**: Yeah.
**Josmendez.m**: And.
**Josmendez.m**: But I need to contact one of them to clarify the specific project and make a right entry into the right project here.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Are you guys currently using any project management software alongside Acumatica?
**Bclymer**: Anything like Procore?
**Josmendez.m**: We use Acumatica because Acumatica has some project module and we control every single project through a Qmatica.
**Josmendez.m**: Not other additional ERP.
**Josmendez.m**: I use, e.g.
**Josmendez.m**: oracle Network, but for other project.

**Bclymer**: Yes, yes, yes.
**Josmendez.m**: Yeah.
**Josmendez.m**: Wait, I need to control in the financial statement, the whip.
**Josmendez.m**: And because at the end of the month, we need to inform to my.
**Josmendez.m**: To the financial director, the the amount of.
**Josmendez.m**: Of the investment they have at that time.
**Josmendez.m**: At the end of the month.
**Josmendez.m**: Yes.

**Bclymer**: Yeah, in Houston.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Josmendez.m**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So why are you looking.
**Bclymer**: Why are you looking to leave?
**Josmendez.m**: Well, you know what I think I have.
**Josmendez.m**: I think I'm ready to take a new challenge because I think I can contribute to support the operation like construction.
**Josmendez.m**: Do you know what?
**Josmendez.m**: Construction is one of the most sector.
**Josmendez.m**: The most important sector into the economy of a country because construction dynamics the economy of other countries.
**Josmendez.m**: So I would like to be part of this dynamic session.
**Bclymer**: See here inventory analysis.
**Bclymer**: So you've done payroll pretty much a lot of the day to day.
**Bclymer**: What about credit card processing?
**Josmendez.m**: Oh, well, we manage our credit card in our company.
**Josmendez.m**: So we process the.
**Josmendez.m**: I control the expenses of the credit card.
**Josmendez.m**: I make the entry in a monthly basis and I review the detail because I received the additional file by Excel.
**Josmendez.m**: So I need to code every single.
**Josmendez.m**: According to the employee and according to the department.
**Josmendez.m**: We select the account for coding the credit card expenses because it's a huge amount.
**Josmendez.m**: We drive into the credit card amount and that is the way we process the credit card expenses.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So are you the one preparing the Excel sheet with the coding?
**Josmendez.m**: Yeah, I prepare Excel sheets because the Excel file is around 500 lines a little more sometimes in that.
**Josmendez.m**: But I use Vlookup.
**Josmendez.m**: I use some if different kind of formulas to make easier that job.
**Josmendez.m**: But it takes around one hour of process.
**Bclymer**: But okay.
**Josmendez.m**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: How many approximately how many invoices would you say you process a month?
**Bclymer**: What's the volume?
**Bclymer**: AP invoices?
**Josmendez.m**: Oh, around more than.
**Josmendez.m**: Around 100 in December.
**Josmendez.m**: We receive a huge amount of invoices in January also.
**Josmendez.m**: But sometimes it's a lower.
**Josmendez.m**: Around 100, a little more sometimes.
**Josmendez.m**: And I need to code to receive to review.
**Josmendez.m**: But we are scaling that way because we need to code and review the amount, the date, the due date that is important and the taxes if applies.
**Josmendez.m**: And also if it is for new vendor, we need to request for W9 and make the duly process.
**Josmendez.m**: But a little more than 100.
**Josmendez.m**: Yes.
**Josmendez.m**: Every single month.
**Josmendez.m**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: What about AR balance?
**Bclymer**: Do you do balance?
**Josmendez.m**: Yeah, but it's.
**Josmendez.m**: It's a lower amount of AR because we need to.
**Josmendez.m**: I need to repair.
**Josmendez.m**: But according to the hours working for different project, we need to charge.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Josmendez.m**: Yeah.
**Josmendez.m**: Less than 20.
**Josmendez.m**: Less than 20 year invoices in AR.
**Josmendez.m**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Are you managing anybody right now?
**Josmendez.m**: Sorry.
**Bclymer**: Are you managing anybody?
**Josmendez.m**: Right now, but one partner in Houston.
**Josmendez.m**: Yes.
**Josmendez.m**: Yeah, it's a uni.
**Josmendez.m**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Brandon, do you have any questions?
**Fnjie**: So one thing, Jose.
**Fnjie**: Whenever you're entering in those credit card transactions, are you doing a journal entry or are you uploading a spreadsheet and it automatically codes it?
**Josmendez.m**: Acumatica is nice because we can support every single entry.
**Josmendez.m**: I prefer Excel format because I can attach a copy of the invoices that is related to the.
**Josmendez.m**: For example, for credit card I need to attach a copy of the statement we received and then I prepare an Excel and then upload in a cumatica all the attachments.
**Fnjie**: So you upload the Excel as a file or do you actually manually enter each transaction?
**Josmendez.m**: Oh, well, we made manually enter, but we upload the support.
**Josmendez.m**: Just the support.
**Fnjie**: So you upload the files of the receipts or whatever.
**Fnjie**: But as far as if you have 1,000 credit card transactions, you're going to go in there and you write each transaction and code in there manually.
**Josmendez.m**: Yeah, but what I do is make a summary.
**Josmendez.m**: So a summary reduce the lines into the journal entry and maybe the file we received to review and coding is a huge file, 500 lines.
**Josmendez.m**: But the journal entry we make a summarize 3p lookup and we make pivot table.
**Josmendez.m**: And to make us a summary in process less line to the journal entry.
**Josmendez.m**: Yeah, but we enter manually the journal entry.
**Fnjie**: Have you ever tried to use the upload to where instead of manually entering it, it automatically pulls the data.
**Josmendez.m**: We only just the attachments.
**Josmendez.m**: The upload the attachment and no complete the journal entry.
**Josmendez.m**: Okay, yeah.
**Fnjie**: Kind of questions do you have for us?
**Josmendez.m**: Well, I have been watching a good information about Aleato and that is nice.
**Josmendez.m**: All the projects you have, all the contributions you make to the economy, to the progress of every single companies and many hospital, many buildings you have been constructed and that's amazing.
**Josmendez.m**: I was looking at.

**Fnjie**: Do you have any other questions?
**Bclymer**: No, I think that's it.
**Bclymer**: That's it for me.
