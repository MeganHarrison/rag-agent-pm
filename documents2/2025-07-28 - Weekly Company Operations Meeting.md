**Gducharme**: What's the.
**Gducharme**: What's.

**Ataylor**: Thank you, Jesse.
**Ataylor**: Goodwill Bloomington.
**Ataylor**: Nick.
**Kmass**: Bloomington.
**Gducharme**: We're.
**Kmass**: We're good to go for now for framing the openings for the windows and also the ordering and installing the windows.
**Kmass**: The utility vault where.
**Kmass**: That's still being held up by Goodwill.
**Kmass**: So we'll talk about that tomorrow during the OIC meeting.
**Gducharme**: Which one, Nick?
**Kmass**: The utility vault.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, so Jared said he's talking to that landlord about some other things, so I'm sure that's part of their discussion that he's trying to get worked out today.
**Ataylor**: Okay, perfect.
**Ataylor**: We have Alec Siva Consulting building.
**Gducharme**: Yep.
**Njepson**: We got the drawings from Rob Ramsey today and he confirmed that he'll be submitting these for permit here soon with another drawing set.
**Njepson**: And the GC is already aware of his intentions of that.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Ataylor**: Is this still in progress?
**Ataylor**: Brandon?
**Ataylor**: Is this.
**Ataylor**: You assign new.
**Bclymer**: That's from.
**Fireflies**: I don't know what that is for, but I mean if that's.
**Fireflies**: If that's for phase two, I mean we.
**Fireflies**: I don't expect to have those drawings for a while.
**Fireflies**: That was created August.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Fireflies**: Oh, this is due date August 8, 2025.
**Fireflies**: So I'm assuming that's for.
**Fireflies**: That must be used for the phase two.
**Gducharme**: But we don't have a.
**Fireflies**: They don't have a rack design yet.
**Ataylor**: Okay, so still it's in progress.
**Ataylor**: Okay, Nick Goodwill car cup office.
**Kmass**: The engineer is working on updating drawings.
**Kmass**: We had a meeting last week to go over the comments with the city engineer.
**Fireflies**: Is that thing ever going to get done?
**Bclymer**: I think so.
**Bclymer**: It's.
**Bclymer**: So Nick with Fritz.
**Bclymer**: That's the guy that's reviews them for the city.
**Bclymer**: We met with him, got exactly what we need to put on the drawings.
**Bclymer**: Who is updating that?
**Bclymer**: We should be able to.
**Bclymer**: We're going to submit them back to Nick first, just as a courtesy.
**Bclymer**: He'll review them and say if it's good or not, and then we'll submit it to the city.
**Bclymer**: And we should be.
**Bclymer**: Should be good because then all he has to do is tell him he approves it and we're good to go.
**Fireflies**: So, future note, if we ever do any kind of work in the city of Indianapolis, that we have any kind of roadway, curb cut, anything we have to use for.
**Bclymer**: Absolutely, yeah.
**Bclymer**: That's when I got that letter from the city, and it's like, from Nick.
**Bclymer**: I'm like, what the hell?
**Bclymer**: What the hell?
**Jdawson**: Wait, so does Fritz have, like, a consulting agreement with him?
**Jdawson**: That's crazy.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Good for him.
**Ataylor**: Okay, perfect.
**Ataylor**: Glenn.
**Ataylor**: Is Glenn here?
**Ataylor**: I hope you join.
**Ataylor**: Westfield Collective.
**Jmendez**: Updated it here.
**Jmendez**: I got Swift Air.
**Jmendez**: Talked to them today.
**Jmendez**: The guy is putting his estimate together.
**Jmendez**: Chad reached out to R.T. moore, somebody he knows there for that as well.
**Jmendez**: That's up on the north side trying to get these H VAC bids hopefully wrapped up this week.
**Fireflies**: Aren't we supposed to get Swift airs on Friday, you said?
**Jmendez**: That's what they told me, and I called him to follow up this morning, and the guy who was doing the estimating called me back, said he needed a couple days to go through it.
**Jmendez**: They didn't get a chance to look at it last week.
**Fireflies**: That's why it's important to continue to follow up.
**Fireflies**: You know, just because somebody says something and then you don't talk to him until the day after it was due, like, you know, now it's like, oh, now it's going to be another week, right?
**Fireflies**: Like, it's just kicking the can down the road.
**Bclymer**: What is the status of the rooftop units that the original sub ordered?
**Fireflies**: I mean, they're ready for.
**Fireflies**: I mean, they could, you know, deliver them.
**Fireflies**: Obviously, that doesn't do us any good because we don't have, you know, the roof on yet.
**Fireflies**: But, I mean, if you were talking.
**Bclymer**: To them, they were.
**Bclymer**: Were they waiting on that until we finalize the sub?
**Bclymer**: You also said they were trying to find some people they work with that would Possibly do it for them.
**Fireflies**: Correct?
**Fireflies**: Yeah.
**Fireflies**: So when I talked to her, you know, I let her know I was like, well, you know, like, you know, if I have somebody else, I have to take a loss.
**Fireflies**: Like how, you know, how do you want to work that out?
**Fireflies**: And she said, let me see about partnering with, you know, somebody else, blah, blah, that.
**Fireflies**: That way they can do it and keep it under our contract and same price and all.
**Fireflies**: So, you know, she says she's.
**Fireflies**: She hasn't got, you know, we're back, she's working on it.
**Fireflies**: But again, if I'm her, you know, I. I wouldn't.
**Fireflies**: I wouldn't deliver those units.
**Gducharme**: You know.
**Fireflies**: Knowing that there's this loss out there.
**Fireflies**: So that's why I want to.
**Fireflies**: I'm going to see what other options are, you know, because I don't know if she's going to find somebody to.
**Fireflies**: To do it at their price.
**Jmendez**: Other than that.
**Jmendez**: Got precons being scheduled over the next two weeks for all the subs that'll be on site over the following.
**Jmendez**: Over the next five months to two months.
**Jmendez**: Got our final utility, underground utility going in next week.
**Jmendez**: We'll be all done with all our permitted utilities to the building.
**Fireflies**: When are we going to have all the pricing for all these interior changes?
**Jmendez**: I haven't even distributed it yet to everybody.
**Jmendez**: I have changed bullets in one.
**Jmendez**: Coming from Axis Demon.
**Jmendez**: I think team's the only one who has it so far.
**Jmendez**: They just, they just came in Friday night.
**Jmendez**: Just got them like at 7pm Friday night.
**Fireflies**: So when are we going to have all the pricing in for it?
**Jmendez**: When do you.
**Jmendez**: When do you need it in buy?
**Jmendez**: Because I. I don't know.
**Jmendez**: Nobody's given me like nobody.
**Jmendez**: I haven't sent it out to everybody and I have not given anybody a deadline.
**Fireflies**: But you're the project manager.
**Fireflies**: When do you think we need.
**Jmendez**: But I'm telling you next.
**Jmendez**: Next Friday.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Fireflies**: I mean, is that what that.
**Fireflies**: Is that adequate?
**Fireflies**: Is that.
**Fireflies**: I mean, you know, look at our schedule, right?
**Fireflies**: Is that, you know, is that something that.
**Fireflies**: Does that hurt our schedule or what does that do to it?
**Fireflies**: Two weeks on a change order seems like a long time.
**Jmendez**: Let me know what you.
**Jmendez**: What you want me to give them a deadline and I'll give it.
**Jmendez**: I'll give it to them.
**Jmendez**: If you think two weeks is too long.
**Jmendez**: I.
**Jmendez**: The electricals is pretty much the biggest part of it and they have it already.
**Jmendez**: There's going to be a little, you know, plumbing.
**Jmendez**: I need to get it to Dorsey today and then use superior.
**Bclymer**: Those are really so Glenn, when, when you have a drawing rotation like this, it should go into Job Planner as a revision and then it should go off to all the subs with the date you need their pricing back by.
**Bclymer**: And then you just put in that if I don't get your pricing back by then you're telling me it's not going to cost me anything extra and you're not going to get a change order for it and that'll motivate them to get you the pricing.
**Bclymer**: So you could put that as five business days is not out of the control.
**Bclymer**: So if you get it sent out today, by next Tuesday they should have their pricing back to you.
**Bclymer**: But that's how you have to send that stuff out.
**Bclymer**: It's all documented.
**Bclymer**: You send it to every single sub so they can't come back later and say that changed my contract amount but I wasn't sent to me.
**Bclymer**: You got to do it through Job Planner, send it out as a drawing revision, send it to everybody and give them six days to give you a price.
**Jmendez**: They're in Draw Planner currently.
**Jmendez**: I have not had time to distribute them to everybody individually.
**Jmendez**: Not everybody is apparently set on the notifications to get drawing revisions automatically for some reason.
**Jmendez**: They get daily report missed notifications automatically, but not important things like drawings.
**Bclymer**: But you got to put together a document that says here's the drawings.
**Bclymer**: These are the drawings that changed.
**Bclymer**: Get me a price on it.
**Bclymer**: If it doesn't affect you, let me know that.
**Gducharme**: Send it.
**Fireflies**: Send it out via email.
**Fireflies**: Like, I mean, you know, like send.
**Bclymer**: Everyone the email at the same time.
**Bclymer**: Like why?
**Bclymer**: Individual.
**Jmendez**: Yeah, I know I will get it done today.
**Jmendez**: I just, I'm on the road trying to get back to the office.
**Jmendez**: I had time to upload them and then I had to get down to school for this traffic that I'm stuck in.
**Ataylor**: Okay, thank you.
**Ataylor**: Glenn Kormar Exit Stack Alec.
**Njepson**: Yeah, so for Cormark, the chain wheel that we're needing was ordered.
**Njepson**: I just got off the phone with Jeff at seven hells about it.
**Njepson**: He's telling me that the items with it are being shipped from three separate locations.
**Njepson**: And part of the reason why there was such a hump in confirming that they were orders that the person that he ordered them from who gave him the price is no longer at the company.
**Njepson**: And he didn't find that out until he called them today and started fishing for it.
**Njepson**: Right now he's saying it's up to seven days to receive everything.
**Njepson**: But he said that he's working on figuring out what expedited shipping is going to do for us.
**Njepson**: So I'm going to call him back before 5, ask him if he had heard back yet.
**Njepson**: And I just touched base with Alex on this as well.
**Fireflies**: So up to seven days.
**Fireflies**: Well, when did he order it?
**Njepson**: He ordered it Friday, but there's, there's a question on if it was truly received Friday or today because the person he ordered it from apparently was no longer in the company on Friday, so.
**Fireflies**: So all right, well, I mean that needs to be installed this week so figure out how to make that happen.
**Njepson**: Yep, I'm on.
**Ataylor**: Thank you.
**Ataylor**: Alec Spire some Lucy.
**Kmass**: Yeah, that's the same thing.
**Kmass**: Ben, their vice president emailed us today saying he's going to take care of the invoices.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: AJ Neiman holding FedEx.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we started cutting holes today just so we can start getting material in there.
**Jdawson**: It's a little bit, a little bit hairy right now, but we're gonna, we're going to keep at it.
**Jdawson**: Everything's approved on my portal.
**Jdawson**: As far as a permit goes, I'm just waiting for them to someone to click a button so I can go pay for it.
**Jdawson**: But we're rolling now.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Bclymer**: When is that going to start?
**Bclymer**: Or are you waiting for that?
**Jdawson**: Oh, we started, I cut, we cut the, we cut the hole this morning.
**Gducharme**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: Alex has been on site all day and I, I was, I was at Carmel dropping off money for the Coram DEO right away permit and I ran into the building, one of the building inspectors and the guy who's in charge of clicking the button and I asked him, he said yeah, they'll get around to it.
**Jdawson**: So no one said anything.
**Jdawson**: Alex did say that a Carmel building comm or like public works or someone drove by today.
**Jdawson**: No one said anything.
**Jdawson**: So no news is good news, I'm going to assume.
**Ataylor**: Okay then.
**Ataylor**: Bill Theater.
**Jdawson**: Aj Yep, met with Bill this morning.
**Jdawson**: We're full on now.
**Jdawson**: Now that we got started on the north apartment.
**Jdawson**: We just had painters there.
**Jdawson**: We're gonna, I'm gonna get him a change order to design that loft.
**Jdawson**: So he wants to do it now.
**Jdawson**: This guy's so wishy washy as far as what he wants to do.
**Jdawson**: But I told him, I said it's gonna be at least 60k, you know, to get it done.
**Jdawson**: So we'll see what, see what he says if he signs it.
**Jdawson**: But like I said, I'm not moving forward with anything until I have stuff signed.
**Jdawson**: I have a signed contract form right.
**Jdawson**: Right now.
**Jdawson**: So I'm doing that work.
**Ataylor**: Thank you aj, I think this is Kev, if I'm not wrong.
**Ataylor**: Or you.
**Ataylor**: AJ Apply engineer office remodel.
**Jdawson**: One second.
**Gducharme**: I'm.
**Bclymer**: One second here.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So applied is going really well.
**Jdawson**: We're finishing drywall right now and sticking to the.
**Jdawson**: To the schedule to a tee.
**Jdawson**: So end of this week, we'll be done finishing drywall, and we'll get our first coat of paint on and keep rolling.
**Ataylor**: Awesome.
**Ataylor**: Jesse Seminole Collective.
**Ataylor**: Jesse D.
**Bclymer**: Really?
**Bclymer**: No update on that.
**Bclymer**: See if they got.
**Bclymer**: It's the lease.
**Fireflies**: Is it with the attorneys.
**Bclymer**: Is it?
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: Yep.
**Ataylor**: Progress in progress.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Jesse Ramire, Per Collective.
**Bclymer**: Working on the.
**Jmendez**: Overall budget and schedule.
**Bclymer**: When did you want to turn that into them, Brandon?
**Gducharme**: I mean, I.
**Gducharme**: It'd be.
**Fireflies**: I mean, when can.
**Fireflies**: When can we have a budget?
**Fireflies**: I mean, is that feasible to get it next week?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I think for sure.
**Bclymer**: Like, based on that plan.
**Bclymer**: The last plan Jesse did is what we're putting numbers together on.
**Bclymer**: We worked on that today.
**Bclymer**: Like, the hotel's basically done, so now it's just putting in the container.
**Bclymer**: Event venue pricing.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So, yeah, I mean, it'll be done this week for sure.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Nick Goodwill, Tremont.
**Kmass**: Yeah, I need to update the estimate and release the design team, which I plan on doing tomorrow.
**Bclymer**: And Brandon, he's.
**Bclymer**: He.
**Bclymer**: Jared said he'd pay half of that initial.
**Bclymer**: Like 1:35 or 140.
**Gducharme**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: And then.
**Fireflies**: Yeah, they're kind of po.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And Nick, did you get a hold of Superior?
**Bclymer**: Yes, I did.
**Gducharme**: Talk to him.
**Gducharme**: Yes, you did or didn't?
**Kmass**: Yes, I did.
**Fireflies**: And what'd he say?
**Kmass**: He said that the mezzanine is approximately $60 a square foot, which came to around $40,000.
**Bclymer**: So his total number is more or less than Glenmark.
**Bclymer**: It's less.
**Bclymer**: It's less.
**Gducharme**: Good.
**Fireflies**: So is he going to give you an updated number?
**Kmass**: He didn't want to give an exact number until we have a design.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Fireflies**: Are you having DKGR get started on design?
**Gducharme**: Yes.
**Fireflies**: Any idea on the timeline?
**Kmass**: No, I'm going to talk to them tomorrow, but I believe they can get.
**Kmass**: Get started right away because when we discussed the Noblesville project last week, they said they can work on that right away, so I assume it's the same for this one.
**Fireflies**: Figure out what the timeline is on that.
**Bclymer**: Then Jared said he would get back to me with all of his.
**Bclymer**: The subs he planned on getting to donate their work that we pulled out so we could coordinate with them.
**Bclymer**: So I haven't.
**Bclymer**: He said it might take him a couple days to do that.
**Gducharme**: Yep.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Kewa Uniqlo.
**Jremillard**: Yes, we are moving along with the electric installation.
**Jremillard**: They are going to start the transformer installation this week.
**Jremillard**: Just the three transformers that are not changing.
**Jremillard**: And last week I got on a call with Exotech and Jesse, the installer for the sprinklers.
**Jremillard**: And we were able to adjust the schedule.
**Jremillard**: So basically our installation is not changing, but Exotech is starting later.
**Jremillard**: So the end date has not changed.
**Jremillard**: So we just shift their start date two weeks later.
**Jremillard**: So they're going to work Saturdays and sometimes Saturdays and Sundays so they can catch up and finish on time.
**Jremillard**: And meanwhile, Jesse and these guys are going to start early.
**Jremillard**: They will put the main in the main pipes and then if they have enough time before Exotech comes in, they're going to the other side and start that as well.
**Jremillard**: So they can.
**Jremillard**: They can save time so they don't have to come back and then leave them remobilize.
**Jremillard**: And the plumbing, we have one more day for the plumber to come back to make some connections and we'll have a final inspection after that.
**Jremillard**: Our initial inspection we passed.
**Jremillard**: So tomorrow I am meeting with Tim the electrician and we will make some adjustments to the schedule based on when he think we will get the new transformers or panels.
**Jremillard**: If that's the decision they're going with.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: So this week these guys would be doing the transformer installation and probably the light switches, the three light switches that they are supposed to install.
**Jremillard**: We still have a few outstanding change orders that there that are being reviewed, including the insurance and the permit cost.
**Jremillard**: And so tomorrow we were able to find the.
**Jremillard**: The subcontractor that did the FI safety installation.
**Jremillard**: I got a hold of him today.
**Jremillard**: So they're looking at the drawings to get us pricing for connecting the fast Pingrast to the existing system.
**Jremillard**: And they also do the fire extinguishers.
**Jremillard**: So he's going to give us pricing for buying one fire extinguisher and relocating the existing ones.
**Fireflies**: Do we have fire extinguishers in our number or did that get taken out?
**Jremillard**: We have $1,000 budget for relocating existing ones and another thousand for buying new ones that we needed.
**Jremillard**: So we looking at the drawings, we have five new ones that have nor fire extinguishers and we have four that are located at locations where it's not specified in the drawings.
**Jremillard**: So we can move those four and then we will need to buy one more to add to that one missing location.
**Bclymer**: Did you get the sprinkler drawing?
**Bclymer**: Is that 100% finalized?
**Bclymer**: Everything's good.
**Bclymer**: To go the new design?
**Jremillard**: No.
**Jremillard**: So Friday Hugo sent that.
**Jremillard**: Those screenshots.
**Jremillard**: Three screenshots.
**Jremillard**: And one out of those three, the engineer and Chris were able to understand the other one, they don't really know what is happening.
**Jremillard**: So I. I called Hugo after.
**Jremillard**: After our meeting.
**Jremillard**: So he.
**Jremillard**: He wants all of us to get back together again on Wednesday.
**Jremillard**: So we are going to.
**Jremillard**: I have set up a meeting for all of us to get together so he can try to explain what he meant in those.
**Bclymer**: So why are we waiting till Wednesday?
**Jremillard**: Because that's when everyone is available.
**Jremillard**: I tried tomorrow and they were not.
**Jremillard**: So I had to shifted to Wednesday.
**Fireflies**: And who is this guy?
**Jremillard**: Hugo is with Exotech.
**Fireflies**: Does he know that we're at a day for day loss every day that we don't get this figured out?
**Jremillard**: I don't think he does.
**Jremillard**: I haven't told him that.
**Fireflies**: That's probably a pretty good piece of information, right?
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Fireflies**: Be amazed at how fast the schedule might clear up if he knows it's a delay of the project.
**Jremillard**: I will.
**Jremillard**: I'll let him know that.
**Ataylor**: Thank you.
**Ataylor**: Kevin.
**Ataylor**: AJ Memphis Cold Storage.
**Ataylor**: Phase two.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I sent an invoice for design and Steve said he's getting it processed.
**Jdawson**: So once we get paid for that, we take it off.
**Ataylor**: Glenn Goodwill Foundations.
**Jmendez**: Goodwill's got the polished concrete flooring.
**Jmendez**: Starting tomorrow, the electrician is going to take a break and go I think help out on one of our other jobs.
**Jmendez**: Maybe Applied Engineering or something.
**Jdawson**: Please.
**Jmendez**: I know, I asked.
**Jmendez**: I asked him to.
**Jmendez**: I know Alex has been asking for somebody.
**Jmendez**: So the same guy we're working with over at.
**Jmendez**: They'll be freed up for the week.
**Fireflies**: So when's that project gonna be done?
**Jmendez**: Next Friday.
**Bclymer**: Did you get the counters where we got something local and available?
**Jmendez**: I did, yes.
**Jmendez**: Jail's getting me.
**Jmendez**: They were getting me their pricing by tomorrow morning on that.
**Jmendez**: But yeah, we did.
**Jmendez**: We were able to find something.
**Jmendez**: Jared emailed me that stuff late Friday night and the first one that they wanted was available.
**Jmendez**: So readily available in 8 foot sections and we'll go with that.
**Jmendez**: I don't know if.
**Jmendez**: I don't know if those will be done by next Friday.
**Jmendez**: They're readily available as in like kind of off the shelf.
**Jmendez**: But not.
**Jmendez**: Not grab and go off the shelf.
**Jmendez**: They may still have a couple few.
**Fireflies**: Day lead time so the project won't be done.
**Jmendez**: And you know how good was.
**Fireflies**: Our part?
**Jmendez**: Our part?
**Jmendez**: Yeah, will be the.
**Jmendez**: The extra stuff.
**Bclymer**: It's all a project so that.
**Fireflies**: Yeah, when you say our part, like are we not Installing the counters.
**Jmendez**: We will.
**Jmendez**: It's something they added, and they know that if it's.
**Jmendez**: If they can't come in in time, then.
**Jmendez**: Then we can come in later.
**Jmendez**: It's not part of the deadline that we have for the scope of work.
**Jmendez**: That's what I mean.
**Bclymer**: Well, just to be clear, when we ask about when a project is done, it means when it's done, we don't have to go back there.
**Bclymer**: So that includes change order work and everything else.
**Jmendez**: Well, I'm trying to get that done by next Friday.
**Jmendez**: I do not know about the cabinets encounters yet on an exact date, but I'm pushing to try and get it done now that they're available.
**Jmendez**: Goodwill still has to approve it.
**Jmendez**: They don't do that in any reasonable amount of time.
**Jmendez**: Usually three, four days it's gonna take.
**Gducharme**: For that.
**Jmendez**: And so far.
**Jmendez**: So they'll have their press in tomorrow, and then when they give me the green light, we'll get a schedule.
**Ataylor**: Thank you.
**Ataylor**: Glenn Kiva Rado, Martinsville.
**Bclymer**: You're muted.
**Gducharme**: Here.
**Jdawson**: I talked with JP today on Martinsville when I was walking with him.
**Jdawson**: There's still work to be done there.
**Jdawson**: I know.
**Jdawson**: I. I guess we'll talk about this when we talk about the Godiva move, but I just told him we're.
**Jdawson**: We're waiting on some.
**Jdawson**: Some pricing.
**Jdawson**: We're getting some extra pricing in for the wall, which Kevin's working on, and once we have that, I'll be comfortable with sending him something here in the next couple days.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Gducharme**: His.
**Jremillard**: His.
**Jdawson**: They're gonna.
**Jdawson**: These guys are wanting this curtain wall, and I'm telling them we don't want to do a curtain wall because there's no way we can keep that area at 65 degrees.
**Jdawson**: Just impossible with what they're wanting.
**Jdawson**: But we're going to give them a swag number for it and, and go from there.
**Jdawson**: But they're being difficult, per usual.
**Jdawson**: But we're working through it.
**Jdawson**: JP's getting annoyed with him as well, so I think he's.
**Jdawson**: He's having an internal discussion with them.
**Jdawson**: But, Kevin, when we send them any pricing for Martinsville, we need to send it directly to JP and no one else.
**Jdawson**: So that engineer that's blowing you up.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, don't listen to him.
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And jp, they.
**Jdawson**: They're get.
**Jdawson**: They're gonna try.
**Jdawson**: They're getting like, another price to compare ours to.
**Jdawson**: But talking with JP today, we're going to have last look, so.
**Jremillard**: Okay, sounds good.
**Ataylor**: Thank you, Eddie.
**Ataylor**: Thank you.
**Ataylor**: Kev Anik, gpc, Harrisburg.
**Njepson**: Yeah, so I just Got an email from Chris Lopez receiving the static drawings.
**Fireflies**: Static rack.
**Fireflies**: Static isn't a thing.
**Njepson**: Yeah, sorry.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, yeah.
**Njepson**: Static rack.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: Touch base with Jesse about that today.
**Njepson**: We are scheduled to have a phone call tomorrow morning.
**Njepson**: We're going to touch base and look at those drawings together.
**Njepson**: And GC Cody Cruz is expecting a follow up from us coordination wise after that meeting we had this afternoon.
**Njepson**: So after I review with Jesse, I can shoot them an email if need be.
**Gducharme**: But.
**Njepson**: Still waiting on the ASRs drawings from Chris Lopez as well.
**Njepson**: But he told me that I'd be getting those today.
**Bclymer**: But we'll see then.
**Fireflies**: Make sure you get all that over to Jesse with Adelphia so you can price up the manpower.
**Gducharme**: Yep.
**Gducharme**: Good call.
**Ataylor**: Thank you, Cornzale.
**Jdawson**: AJ Yeah, we got our right away permit today just in time to start stripping some topsoil.
**Jdawson**: They actually.
**Jdawson**: Because I got kind of screwed because they're.
**Jdawson**: I guess they're lime stabilizing at Collective tomorrow now.
**Jdawson**: I think they were trying to maybe do that today and that.
**Jdawson**: That dozer was what I needed at Quorum.
**Jdawson**: So granted, Quorums are dropping the bucket compared.
**Jdawson**: So they're.
**Jdawson**: Once they're done lime stabilizing tomorrow, they will bring the dozer over and start at Coram.
**Jdawson**: It'd probably be Wednesday, and then we're paving Thursday, Friday, and we'll be wrapped up with that job this week.
**Jdawson**: Just have to put some carpet on the inside.
**Jdawson**: And the goal, the plan, assuming weather permitting, is we'll be done here at the end of this week.
**Ataylor**: Thank you, AJ Radial Avon.
**Jremillard**: I think right now we are moving along there as well.
**Jremillard**: So the, the doctor guys are continuing to put on the new levelers and I think the doors are being installed as well.
**Jdawson**: Doors are.
**Jmendez**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So doors are complete.
**Fireflies**: If you're, if you don't know something, don't just say I think this, that and the other.
**Fireflies**: Like we know we have these meetings, like if you don't know, like, get with the team, figure it out.
**Fireflies**: But like, you know, this is an internal meeting, you know, so like it.
**Fireflies**: It doesn't look bad.
**Fireflies**: But if you say that kind of stuff, like on regular meetings with jobs and owners and stuff, all that does is, is you know, make them not confident.
**Fireflies**: Whenever you're not confident, it's 10x for a client.
**Fireflies**: So like saying I think this, I think that when we should definitely know where the hell we're at.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, he's.
**Jdawson**: He's right, Kevin.
**Jdawson**: Part of that's on me.
**Jdawson**: Right?
**Jdawson**: We didn't pow out before this so, and I'm, I've been kind of handling that on site.
**Jdawson**: So that being said, all the doors are installed by the end of this week.
**Jdawson**: All of the pits will have been cut and poured and then we're just waiting for that concrete to cure and we'll have all the levelers and, and dock locks done end of next week, so well ahead of schedule.
**Gducharme**: And then.
**Jdawson**: We'Ll put the seals on.
**Jdawson**: The seals were delivered last week.
**Jdawson**: JP's pushing for me to get him on this week.
**Jdawson**: I'm like, well, I, I really don't want to have to make my guy mobilized like for a day at a time like to get him up and running.
**Jdawson**: So we're gonna try and keep holding off on seal install until end of next week.
**Jdawson**: And my core guys there drilling holes to connect all the new dock locks that we installed.
**Jdawson**: They keep adding fencing, etc, so we'll keep rolling with it there.
**Jdawson**: But it's starting to tone down and we're, we're getting done with it pretty quick.
**Fireflies**: When are you gonna do that shutdown?
**Jdawson**: So they gave us a time between 5:30 and 7.
**Jdawson**: Brandon when we were walking with him, and right now we can do it every day between 5:30 and 7, but we're waiting until JP tells us to.
**Jdawson**: So right now I don't have a date.
**Jdawson**: And then on that, when we talked.
**Fireflies**: On site, it was very urgent.
**Fireflies**: So I guess it's not now.
**Jdawson**: It's not.
**Jdawson**: It changes.
**Jdawson**: It changes.
**Jdawson**: So what, what we were able to do is we robbed.
**Jdawson**: They have those quads to the, to the right of each door.
**Jdawson**: So that controller we're just going to plug into the quad outlets that are.
**Fireflies**: Existing there and rob those.
**Jdawson**: So my core guy cord the doors that we were able to do that on and, and we're getting them wired up now.
**Jdawson**: So they're gonna, he's gonna have an extra five outbound doors by the end of tomorrow.
**Jdawson**: Okay, that solves his problem.
**Fireflies**: Those controls are plugs, not direct wire.
**Jdawson**: You can direct wire them, but yeah, they just plug in.
**Jdawson**: What we're doing is we're going to take that quad box off, flip the breaker off and, and hardwire them.
**Fireflies**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Fireflies**: So you are going to hardwire.
**Gducharme**: Gotcha.
**Fireflies**: Yeah, Just make sure that you got a blank cover or something to, you know, cover that.
**Gducharme**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: That way that get.
**Jdawson**: That solves their problem of getting some extra dock doors.
**Jdawson**: And then now they're going to get off JP's back.
**Fireflies**: Yeah, that works.
**Gducharme**: It's good.
**Jremillard**: AJ, that change order is done.
**Jremillard**: I sent it to you on teams.
**Jdawson**: Awesome.
**Fireflies**: Change order for what?
**Jremillard**: For Baylor Power.
**Jdawson**: The Baylor Power.
**Fireflies**: Make sure we're notching up that revenue.
**Jdawson**: Number we have been.
**Jdawson**: And Brandon, you'd be proud.
**Jdawson**: I was busting his balls about getting a meeting with Billy.
**Gducharme**: Good.
**Jdawson**: Because Billy.
**Jdawson**: So I sent him a ad for the added guardrail we did at Brownsburg.
**Gducharme**: And.
**Jdawson**: And Billy declined it.
**Gducharme**: And.
**Jdawson**: And JP goes, well, you can't decline it because they already did it.
**Jdawson**: And so.
**Jdawson**: And so Billy's like, all in an uproar about wanting a breakdown of it.
**Jdawson**: And I said, okay, I'll give you a breakdown.
**Jdawson**: And I basically come out to be like, they got it done in two days.
**Jdawson**: I'm like, yeah, well, I had five carpenters, and I pay him 125 bucks an hour.
**Jdawson**: That's 5,000 bucks a day.
**Jdawson**: And we just got it done.
**Jdawson**: We stayed long and got.
**Jdawson**: And so I was like, I'll justify it all.
**Gducharme**: You want.
**Jdawson**: JP's like, yeah, I don't care.
**Fireflies**: But yeah, I mean, tell Billy he can meet with me.
**Fireflies**: I'm happy to go through it with him.
**Jdawson**: That's exactly what I said.
**Jdawson**: I said, you know what Brandon's gonna.
**Gducharme**: Say.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Fireflies**: I'm gonna find that guy's cell phone number.
**Jdawson**: What'd you say?
**Fireflies**: I'm gonna find that guy's cell phone number.
**Gducharme**: Do it.
**Jdawson**: We've been, yeah, and we don't want to get in the habit.
**Jdawson**: Kevin.
**Jdawson**: I was talking with JP about it today of cutting our price, right?
**Jdawson**: We did that once.
**Jdawson**: And now, like, we're sending them the Martinsville pricing, and they're going to be like, oh, this is too expensive.
**Jdawson**: And I was like, what I keep telling JP is, you know, the reason you use this one is it's.
**Jdawson**: We're damn good at what we do and we.
**Jdawson**: We meet your deadline.
**Jdawson**: So if, right, they can go get another price if they want.
**Jdawson**: JP's gonna give us last look, but we're gonna keep adding stuff on because I did inflate.
**Jdawson**: I added like five grand on that guardrail price.
**Fireflies**: But still, yeah, I mean, again, part of it, you know, that's what I teach you and everybody else is, you know, understanding, you know, whenever something comes down the pipe, what you can inflate numbers on and what you can't, right?
**Fireflies**: So, like, you know, knowing stuff that, like, hey, we got to do this or it's the city's fault or it's a last minute thing, whatever, like, boom, we're going to tick it up and, and make back, you know, some money.
**Fireflies**: So, I mean, you know, don't forget, guys, we're a for profit company.
**Ataylor**: Okay, moving forward.
**Ataylor**: Ag13,200 for market.
**Jdawson**: We received final.
**Jdawson**: Final payment.
**Jdawson**: I'll do a PSR here so we can show how much money we made on it.
**Jdawson**: But you can close this out.
**Jdawson**: Maria.
**Ataylor**: Close it?
**Ataylor**: Like done or done?
**Ataylor**: Complete.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Eva Aspire.
**Ataylor**: Sorry, Nick.
**Ataylor**: Aspire.
**Ataylor**: Kissimmee.
**Kmass**: Yeah, I just need to do the owner invoicing this month.
**Fireflies**: Get that in while Ben's in that check.
**Fireflies**: Right mood.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: AJ Radial, Brownsburg.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, we got the updated pos.
**Jdawson**: So I just got to send JP a bill.
**Jdawson**: It'd be a final.
**Jdawson**: It'd be one bill.
**Jdawson**: The final bill.
**Jdawson**: This is the one that they're giving pushback on the guardrail pricing.
**Ataylor**: Thank you.
**Ataylor**: A.J.
**Ataylor**: glenn.
**Ataylor**: Goodwill indicator.
**Jmendez**: I just dropped off the extension cord that went missing and found out that the file cabinet is all that's broken, not the entire desk.
**Jmendez**: So I'm going to try and find a file cabinet that I can replace that with and then we'll be done down there.
**Bclymer**: What did Greg say?
**Fireflies**: Greg Kelly?
**Bclymer**: I don't know.
**Gducharme**: Is it.
**Bclymer**: Who's the ad?
**Bclymer**: The framer?
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Jmendez**: That was Glenmark.
**Jmendez**: Greg said his sons didn't take it.
**Jmendez**: Nobody took the extension cord.
**Jmendez**: Nobody took any of the drinks.
**Jmendez**: Nobody drank anything.
**Jmendez**: Nobody broke anything.
**Jmendez**: He said that's his son and his son's best friend and he's known him his whole life.
**Gducharme**: And they didn't do it.
**Bclymer**: That's what he said.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: And this is Nick.
**Ataylor**: The Robling Humps.
**Kmass**: Depending on the inspection and equipment delivery, we're starting demo tomorrow afternoon or Wednesday morning.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Before moving to estimating, do we have any current projects?
**Ataylor**: No.
**Ataylor**: I need to add.
**Ataylor**: No.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Moving to estimating.
**Ataylor**: A.J.
**Ataylor**: stungate, orchard.
**Ataylor**: Dentist.
**Jdawson**: No update.
**Gducharme**: Cool.
**Jdawson**: I'm sorry.
**Jdawson**: Since that last one.
**Jdawson**: I spoke with him last week and I just didn't type in the update.
**Ataylor**: It's okay.
**Ataylor**: You're a follower now.
**Ataylor**: You get it.
**Jdawson**: They're still moving forward with it.
**Jdawson**: You know, they loved what we did for our layout.
**Jdawson**: They need like two weeks to get this guy off the deed.
**Jdawson**: Three weeks and then he said follow up with him.
**Jdawson**: So I have it on my list to follow up here probably into next week.
**Fireflies**: So mixed use.
**Fireflies**: Kentucky.
**Fireflies**: We're getting updated layout to do townhomes per the survey.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Is that.
**Bclymer**: Are you having Abinob or one of those guys do these drawings?
**Fireflies**: I'm just having them do the.
**Fireflies**: The site.
**Fireflies**: Like the site stuff.
**Fireflies**: Like just the initial layouts.
**Fireflies**: I won't have Them do any detail drawings.
**Fireflies**: But yeah, I'm just gonna have them like I said lay stuff out.
**Bclymer**: And do we need to do start an estimate for those after he gets his layout?
**Jdawson**: I mean.
**Fireflies**: Yeah, we will.
**Fireflies**: I mean once I get a you know, layout and everything approved by Patrick and Mike.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: PR aisle, Jesse, Brendan.
**Bclymer**: I think that's all turned in.
**Bclymer**: Is there anything else they need?
**Fireflies**: I mean I'm just.
**Fireflies**: I gotta go through the whole package on everything and.
**Fireflies**: But I mean as far as anything, they're immediately waiting on us.
**Fireflies**: No.
**Ataylor**: Let me know you printed please.
**Ataylor**: Just to make sure everything makes sense and it's good.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: I already did.
**Gducharme**: It looked good.
**Ataylor**: Ah, it looked good.
**Gducharme**: Awesome.
**Ataylor**: Good, I'm glad Neville's careful.
**Ataylor**: Neville's View Excel center this Nick?
**Kmass**: Yeah, Andrew's back this week, so I'll talk to him about this approving the design.
**Ataylor**: Okay, thank you.
**Ataylor**: Alta Beauty, Fresno AJ.
**Jdawson**: I currently working on the estimate now.
**Jdawson**: Jesse's working on getting some locked in H vac pricing estimates ready to go.
**Jdawson**: We just got to firm up our numbers and this clarifications will be ready in the next 10 to 15 minutes.
**Fireflies**: Jesse, did we get any numbers?
**Jmendez**: No, I just got a text back from one of them saying they have an issue getting equipment pricing right now and he should have something to me by the end of the day.
**Jmendez**: And I have to call the other guy when I get off this call.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, and I talked to Valiant and he's getting us some.
**Jdawson**: So Brandon, someone's already like reached out to an engineer, which I'm assuming is why Ulta's like script, like why Walter was telling you he needs it today.
**Jdawson**: So there's like people that have been working on this.
**Jdawson**: So when I talk to Valley Air, they're thinking it's going to be less than 15 units.
**Jdawson**: Right now my price is for 15 units, but depending on what they send us back, it may be 10 units.
**Jdawson**: I don't know.
**Fireflies**: Yeah, I mean I. I mean I'm fine with you know, saying 15 units and you know, if you know, if it's 14 or 10 or whatever.
**Fireflies**: But it's like hey man, we, you know, we have not engineered yet.
**Fireflies**: Like we're, we're you know, being conservative with our numbers, you know.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Fireflies**: So I just.
**Fireflies**: The issue is that we just don't have any numbers.
**Fireflies**: Like I mean what we're doing right now in this hour we could have done last week.
**Fireflies**: Like the fact that you know, everybody says that they're going to get us numbers and then somehow we never get them.
**Fireflies**: You know, it's like it's useless.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I mean it's only 118 out there.
**Jdawson**: And I Valiere called me, said hey, I'm not going to get this to you by noon, but I am like I'm getting it to you.
**Jdawson**: So I said that's fine, I just have to have it today.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Fireflies**: I mean he's going to give me.
**Jdawson**: A per unit price as well.
**Jdawson**: Like here's what it is for one unit and then here's what we recommend and then we can, we can go at it from there.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Fireflies**: I mean and like you don't set these with a crane.
**Fireflies**: You use a helicopter.
**Jdawson**: I, if that's, yeah.
**Jdawson**: What's wrong with the crane?
**Fireflies**: Can't reach.
**Jdawson**: You have to go all the way.
**Fireflies**: Around the building with a massive crane.
**Fireflies**: Trying to think about that.
**Fireflies**: Trying to set from, you know, the parking lot to the center of the building.
**Fireflies**: You know how long it cost?
**Jdawson**: 50 grand.
**Fireflies**: Well yeah, but, or what you do is you, you use a, a helicopter is how we set them and it.
**Gducharme**: Just.
**Jdawson**: We'Re covered with that 50, 000 number I know for a crane.
**Jdawson**: So I'm not sure how much a helicopter lift is going to cost.
**Fireflies**: I mean probably not far off, you know.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Fireflies**: I mean that you said it'll, they'll set with the helicopter.
**Fireflies**: They'll set those in less than an hour.
**Jdawson**: You think like Damn.
**Jdawson**: Really?
**Fireflies**: 100.
**Fireflies**: It's what I've done all the, all the warehouses where I add units.
**Jdawson**: I've never done a, it's like in Dallas we used a big crane.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Fireflies**: It just depends on how many you're doing and in locations but where these layout.
**Jdawson**: I, I would 15 may take a long time with one.
**Fireflies**: I would, I would highly think that we would be using a helicopter.
**Gducharme**: All right.
**Jdawson**: Well we can, we can go through it here after this or something.
**Gducharme**: All right.
**Gducharme**: Gotcha.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Fireflies**: I think again, I think you're.
**Gducharme**: I.
**Fireflies**: Think your duck number's a little high there.
**Jdawson**: But yeah, I mean it, I, I, I got a price for blowing go's for, for a new unit with blow and go diffuser in Dallas like three, four weeks ago.
**Jdawson**: And so I'll, I'll compare it with that but I just, it's California.
**Jdawson**: So you want me to put a line item in there for California, like an extra 10% for California costs because everybody's more expensive.
**Fireflies**: I mean, I don't know.
**Fireflies**: I mean again, I just.
**Jdawson**: We'll keep following up.
**Jdawson**: We'll get, we'll get numbers here it's an hour past the due time.
**Jdawson**: So we'll, we'll follow up with them and we'll get some in.
**Ataylor**: Jesse, did you get any reply from the Arizona related to the reciprocity for California?
**Bclymer**: I haven't, I looked.
**Bclymer**: I was looking through my emails to see.
**Ataylor**: Still nothing.
**Bclymer**: There was nothing in my mail this weekend.
**Ataylor**: Okay, if not, I'll call tomorrow because he said it's gonna be there last week.
**Ataylor**: So I'll call them tomorrow.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Oh wait, no, I can't call them right now because they are two hours before us, so it's still early there.
**Bclymer**: Three hours actually.
**Ataylor**: Three hours.
**Ataylor**: Okay, so I'll call them one more.
**Ataylor**: Okay, I'll call them once we're done just to see what's going on.
**Ataylor**: So we need that reciprocity letter.
**Ataylor**: Okay?
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Jesse, Tampa office building.
**Bclymer**: Haven't heard anything from them guys.
**Ataylor**: Okay, thank you.
**Ataylor**: Jesse, this is AJ Church, your auto repair.
**Fireflies**: You can mark that as Lost Tampa.
**Ataylor**: Ah, no, this one.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: What'd they say, Brandon or.
**Fireflies**: Just haven't heard from them, just haven't responded.
**Fireflies**: You know I followed up with them a couple times, so.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Nick, Goodwill store for modifications.
**Kmass**: Yeah, Andrew has the proposals for that and I'll ask him about that tomorrow.
**Ataylor**: Thank you.
**Ataylor**: This is also Nick Biolab expansion.
**Kmass**: Jesse turned in the proposal yesterday for that or this morning.
**Bclymer**: You can put on there.
**Bclymer**: I spoke to the owner, he's in Europe until the 8th of August so when he gets back we'll meet and go over the different options.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: AG Vermian Rice Building edition.
**Jdawson**: What have we heard on that?
**Jdawson**: Brandon?
**Fireflies**: Believe the board vote was today or tomorrow, I can't remember.
**Gducharme**: Nice.
**Fireflies**: Expected to be passed and we sh.
**Fireflies**: I think Mark said he wants to tinnitably have a meeting for next week.
**Gducharme**: Oh yeah.
**Jdawson**: Hopefully release us on design.
**Fireflies**: At least that's the plan.
**Jdawson**: Nice.
**Ataylor**: Okay, this is A.J.
**Ataylor**: i think Jesse and Alec.
**Ataylor**: 440 was nor building.
**Njepson**: Yeah, Jesse sent the proposal to the owner last Tuesday and last week we sent breakout pricing for the two Portic shears.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I think they have a.
**Bclymer**: Like the condos board meeting was going to be later late last week or first of this week and so after they meet and discuss he'll get back to us and see what they can afford to do.
**Ataylor**: Okay, thank you guys.
**Ataylor**: Radial Godiva Keva.
**Jremillard**: Yes, I have right now just waiting for pricing for the H Vac.
**Jremillard**: I did receive pricing for electric demo data framing and drywall and in two words I plugged numbers in for that.
**Jremillard**: So right Now I just need H Vac.
**Bclymer**: Go ahead.
**Jdawson**: What about those other framers?
**Gducharme**: Because.
**Jdawson**: Yes, I bought us a couple days, but we gotta get another number.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, so I just got a text from one of the guys that I'm talking to.
**Jremillard**: He wants me to do the takeoffs for him, and he can get me numbers tomorrow morning.
**Fireflies**: So is that the only.
**Fireflies**: Is that the only guy you're getting numbers from?
**Fireflies**: Because the issue is when we do a takeoff for somebody and we say, here you go.
**Fireflies**: If we're wrong, we own that.
**Jremillard**: No, he would be.
**Jremillard**: He would be our second number.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we already have.
**Jdawson**: We already have pricing from someone.
**Jdawson**: Brandon.
**Jdawson**: We just want something to compare it to because that's the expensive part of the job.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Fireflies**: And so we.
**Gducharme**: We.
**Fireflies**: We only have.
**Fireflies**: We're going to have basically one and a half numbers.
**Fireflies**: What about a third number where somebody actually does their own takeoff?
**Jremillard**: Well, the first one did.
**Jremillard**: He's on takeoff.
**Jremillard**: So, A. I have reached out to a lot of people.
**Jremillard**: Some of them don't get back.
**Jremillard**: And I have reached out to a.
**Gducharme**: Couple.
**Jremillard**: So that only two people that are responding.
**Jremillard**: One of them sent their numbers and the other one is supposed to get back tomorrow morning.
**Fireflies**: So we're not going to have three numbers.
**Fireflies**: You're selling me?
**Jremillard**: As of now?
**Jremillard**: No.
**Bclymer**: Trying.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Columbus Christian Academy.
**Ataylor**: AJ.
**Jdawson**: We have a meeting on the books in.
**Jdawson**: In August into August, like three weeks from now.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: And then the last one we have, variable permitting.
**Ataylor**: AJ.
**Jdawson**: I don't really.
**Jdawson**: What did Riley respond this morning?
**Jdawson**: Riley wants us to send him a price, so.
**Jdawson**: Maria, have we gotten any confirmation on what it's going to take for reciprocity between Arizona and Vegas?
**Ataylor**: We have done it.
**Ataylor**: I know what it is, but we're not sure yet.
**Ataylor**: So that's what I haven't applied yet.
**Ataylor**: I think we were discussing that with Brandon and Jesse.
**Ataylor**: That's why.
**Ataylor**: But we have already everything.
**Ataylor**: It's just a matter of applying.
**Jdawson**: Brandon.
**Jdawson**: Jesse.
**Fireflies**: Are we sure Nevada does reciprocity with Arizona?

**Fireflies**: Yeah, I mean, I'd say, you know, a minimum of 10,000, but, you know, that's, you know, for Texas, where we don't have to do anything.
**Fireflies**: I.
**Fireflies**: You know, we need to understand what the costs are and the time needed to get a license in Vegas.
**Jdawson**: Well, and the biggest thing is if we have to take a business.
**Jdawson**: Maria, do we have to take a business in law course?
**Jdawson**: Meaning does Jesse.
**Fireflies**: And a bond and everything else, Correct?
**Ataylor**: Yes, in a bond and also experience.
**Ataylor**: And also, we need to ask for the reciprocity letter from Arizona, and it's taking them more than a month to give it to us.
**Ataylor**: That's why I'm going to call them right now, because we need to see what.
**Ataylor**: What's going on with that.
**Ataylor**: And.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, so it's a.
**Ataylor**: It's a long process.
