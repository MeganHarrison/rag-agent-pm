## Transcript
**Aelkarrimy**: Hello.
**Bclymer**: Hey.
**Jdawson**: Good morning everyone.
**Mparsons**: Good morning.
**Aelkarrimy**: Good morning.
**Bclymer**: Thank you, Cabo.
**Jdawson**: All right, I think we can get started.
**Jdawson**: I'm not sure Yusuke is going to.
**Bclymer**: Be able to join today.
**Jdawson**: He is traveling.
**Jdawson**: So yesterday we had a quick call with Exotech and basically there was a.
**Jdawson**: There's a small thing that we need to accommodate.
**Jdawson**: It's not really that small, but somewhat small.
**Jdawson**: We need to upsize the transformers and I'll kind of pass it along to Cody and Brian to present it.
**Jdawson**: Brian or Cody, do you mind just kind of running through what are the requirements for the transformers?
**Gtjones**: Yeah.
**Gtjones**: So we got updated electrical information from the EXITEC team and some of the loads grew a little bit, particularly on the skypath or the conveying system side.
**Gtjones**: So those were originally designed as 45 KVA step down transformers.
**Gtjones**: We're still waiting back for a little bit of confirmation, but I think we're pretty finalized on these numbers.
**Gtjones**: We've got one that's at 47 and a half KVA.
**Gtjones**: So that'll need to be a probably a 75 KVA transformer now.
**Gtjones**: And then the other three are 79, 80 KVA and 85 KVA.
**Gtjones**: So those three will have to be increased to 112 and a half KVA I believe, because that should be the next standard size.
**Aelkarrimy**: This is Tim with deem.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay, so quick question.
**Aelkarrimy**: I guess.
**Aelkarrimy**: So on the original sheets, sheet E400, we have a conditioning transformer.
**Aelkarrimy**: It's a step down from 480 to 400 volts and then the main gear is 1200 to 400 volts.
**Aelkarrimy**: Correct.
**Gtjones**: Sorry, say that one more time.
**Aelkarrimy**: So the 1200amp feeder to the new panel, there's a transformer in line with that new panel that's 480 to 400 volts.
**Aelkarrimy**: And the 1200amp panel is 400 volts.
**Aelkarrimy**: So when we put all the panel for the Skypod, are they requiring the special voltage?
**Gtjones**: The 1200amp panel shouldn't be 400 volts.
**Gtjones**: It should still be at 480.
**Gtjones**: But yes, they, they.
**Gtjones**: Go ahead.
**Aelkarrimy**: I'm just going by what was on sheet E 400 and red for my friends.
**Aelkarrimy**: It says new conductors from MDP panel to be aluminum MC feeders.
**Aelkarrimy**: And then step down transformer 480 to 400 volts and then new 1200amp 400 volt panel.
**Aelkarrimy**: So that's what I ordered.
**Aelkarrimy**: That's what's on the way.
**Jdawson**: Tim, is there any way we can pause this order now?
**Jdawson**: Because we definitely need to swap out some things.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah, I mean we as far as the.
**Aelkarrimy**: I mean, my concern is we can change anything.
**Aelkarrimy**: It's just a time matter.
**Aelkarrimy**: You know, Obviously, if we do 277, 480 is going to be quicker to get versus the special order 400 and the 400 that I've already got on the way.
**Aelkarrimy**: So yeah, let's go ahead and figure out what we need as far as the transformers on 75s and 112s.
**Aelkarrimy**: So we're bumping those all up.
**Aelkarrimy**: I'm good with that.
**Aelkarrimy**: And then you want a cost for those.
**Gtjones**: Hey, Tim, before we go any further, I've.
**Gtjones**: We've never issued an E400 sheet.
**Gtjones**: We have an E401 sheet, but we've also never called for a larger transformer to feed that that board.
**Gtjones**: So I want to make sure we're talking about the same project.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yes, same project.
**Aelkarrimy**: These were issued on 4120 contract documents.
**Jdawson**: Tim, do you mind sharing your screen?
**Aelkarrimy**: I don't know how to do that.
**Aelkarrimy**: I mean it would.
**Aelkarrimy**: I'm just looking at a paper on my desk.
**Aelkarrimy**: So.
**Jdawson**: Kaba or Mike, can one of you guys Please share this E400 sheet on the screen?
**Mparsons**: I'm looking for it right now.
**Mparsons**: I'll put it up.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah, this is off the original.
**Aelkarrimy**: It's got all the Sky Pods on it.
**Aelkarrimy**: Third party electrical equipment.
**Gtjones**: Well, the other thing I'll say is we got submittals and reviewed submittals and it had individual smaller transformers.
**Gtjones**: So.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah, the transformers are all.
**Aelkarrimy**: The transformers on the sky pods are all 277, 480.
**Aelkarrimy**: The only thing that's not is the main gear and that transformer feeding that main gear.
**Gtjones**: The.
**Gtjones**: The transformers for the sky pod in the Skypath should be 480 to 400 volt, not 400 to 480.
**Gtjones**: 277.
**Aelkarrimy**: So you're wanting the transformers on the Skypod 277, 482, 480 are down to 400 volts on all.
**Aelkarrimy**: So all the Skype.
**Aelkarrimy**: All the skypod equipment is 400 volts.
**Aelkarrimy**: Is that what I'm understanding?
**Gtjones**: Yeah.
**Gtjones**: We should have the full 482.77 up to the 1200amp panel.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah.
**Gtjones**: And then we're taking 483 phase to eight transformers.
**Gtjones**: That step it down from 483 phase to 400, 231 volt.
**Aelkarrimy**: All right, but now we're saying those Transformers, the original ones weren't even right?
**Aelkarrimy**: Correct.
**Aelkarrimy**: Because we're bumping those up too.
**Gtjones**: Yeah, some of those have to Increase.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah.
**Aelkarrimy**: All right, let's see what we can come up with.
**Gtjones**: I mean, I'm looking at the submittal right now, and what was submitted was 480 to 400 volt.
**Gtjones**: Step down transformers.
**Gtjones**: So do you mind.
**Jdawson**: Do you mind sharing your screen just so that everyone sees what we're discussing?
**Gtjones**: 45 KVA.
**Gtjones**: Primary voltage is 480.
**Aelkarrimy**: Secondary voltage 400.
**Gtjones**: Same thing on the 75 KVAs.
**Aelkarrimy**: Well, good deal.
**Gtjones**: And this is the one line we've.
**Gtjones**: We've had issued for quite some time now.
**Gtjones**: 480 volt into this main step down, or, excuse me, this main distribution panel.
**Gtjones**: And then we don't.
**Gtjones**: We don't derive 400 volt until we get to the.
**Gtjones**: The transformers themselves.
**Aelkarrimy**: Sky Pods.
**Gtjones**: Yep.
**Gtjones**: Skypods and skypath.
**Gtjones**: Cabo, were you able to find that drawing to share so we can kind of see what Tim seeing?
**Mparsons**: Sorry, I was muted.
**Mparsons**: Tim, you were Saying it's an E400?
**Aelkarrimy**: Yes, sir.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: This set I'm looking at doesn't have that.
**Mparsons**: Let me check other ones.
**Jdawson**: Tim, do you mind emailing it to someone so we can share it on the screen?
**Aelkarrimy**: I can try to take a picture and email it.
**Jdawson**: Sure.
**Aelkarrimy**: Well, while we're Talking about the SkyPods, are we mounting those up high?
**Gtjones**: Those should be on grade.
**Gtjones**: Yep, that.
**Aelkarrimy**: Sorry, guys.
**Aelkarrimy**: A lot of stuff.
**Gtjones**: While we're waiting that I can say if.
**Gtjones**: If we want to save a little bit on the change order on this.
**Gtjones**: Looks like a couple of the Sky Pod drops reduced in power to a point where we could change those from 75 back to 45 Kvas.
**Gtjones**: So we could repurpose at least two of those 45s that are already on order or that are on the submittal at least, and not have quite as large of a change?
**Jdawson**: Brian, is there any way we can mark up that one line diagram and then send that over to Exotech just to confirm first, prior to, like, saying that we can keep the 45 one?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I think it would just be worthwhile just to make sure that Exotech blesses it.
**Jdawson**: And then we can send it out to GC and the electrician.
**Jdawson**: This way they can price the change order accordingly.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah, you're absolutely right.
**Aelkarrimy**: On the submittals it does call out 48277 on that 1200amp coming in.
**Jdawson**: Whose title block is this?
**Jdawson**: Whose title block is this?
**Aelkarrimy**: I sent it to myself, so I'm waiting for it to come through and then I'll send it to you because the submittals are correct.
**Jdawson**: But I.
**Jdawson**: Brian, this Is not our drawing correct?
**Gtjones**: No.
**Mparsons**: Tim, is this the page you were talking about?
**Mparsons**: The E400?
**Aelkarrimy**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: What project is this?
**Gtjones**: Can you pan down a little bit?
**Gtjones**: That said, just so I can see a title block?
**Gtjones**: Lopa.
**Gtjones**: Lopa.
**Jdawson**: No, that's the township.
**Jdawson**: That's correct.
**Bclymer**: But then.
**Jdawson**: But this is not our.
**Jdawson**: Our sheet.
**Jdawson**: We never issued this guy.
**Bcritzman**: This is the.
**Bcritzman**: Is this the.
**Bcritzman**: This is the base building sheet, I believe, Kevin.
**Gtjones**: Right.
**Mparsons**: Correct.
**Mparsons**: Yes.
**Bcritzman**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Gtjones**: Okay.
**Gtjones**: I mean, it's the right building, but I don't know where this markup came from because we never produced anything like this.
**Aelkarrimy**: I mean, the whole set has got the sky pods, everything in it.
**Aelkarrimy**: I mean, everything what we're doing.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, there's a set with the Sky Pods in it.
**Jdawson**: That's correct.
**Jdawson**: That's what we permitted.
**Jdawson**: But then this drawing should not be referenced.
**Jdawson**: If we're working off of the permanent sets.
**Jdawson**: The permitted sets has a one line diagram that shows what we need to do, all the step downs that are required and the loc approximate locations.
**Bcritzman**: So pull up the.
**Bcritzman**: The.
**Bcritzman**: Pull up the actual permit drawings.
**Bcritzman**: No.
**Bcritzman**: Go to permit set.
**Aelkarrimy**: All right, I'm driving.
**Bcritzman**: All right.
**Bcritzman**: What are we looking at electrical here?
**Jdawson**: Is this the permit set?
**Bcritzman**: Yeah.
**Gtjones**: Should be one or two sheets.
**Gtjones**: I think two sheets back from that.
**Jdawson**: One down.
**Gtjones**: Yeah, sorry, I meant one sheet back.
**Gtjones**: That's the.
**Gtjones**: There's the distribution.
**Gtjones**: We designed.
**Aelkarrimy**: 1200Amp feeder transformers.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Bcritzman**: Yep.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah, you can just cloud which ones you want to change out, what sizes, and then we can move the other ones we're changing out.
**Bcritzman**: Yeah, we can.
**Bcritzman**: We'll make whatever adjustments.
**Bcritzman**: Ahmed.
**Bcritzman**: If you guys just want to, like I said, mark up, a PDF is fine.
**Bcritzman**: And then we'll, you know, obviously reuse whatever we can and you know, figure out what the net cost differences.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, and if you can send that net cost to myself, Brian, Yasuke, and Joseph from Exotech, that would be great.
**Bcritzman**: Yeah, yeah, we'll just send it to the whole team.
**Jdawson**: Awesome.
**Jdawson**: And then, Koji, what we're going to do is Brian is going to mark this up.
**Jdawson**: We're going to send it to you and Joseph.
**Jdawson**: Once you guys bless it, then we will distribute it to the GC just to make sure that we're all in alignment.
**Bcritzman**: Yep, perfect.
**Bcritzman**: Cool.
**Bcritzman**: Amanda, do you think you can get that to us Monday?
**Jdawson**: Brian, do you think we can get.
**Bclymer**: This out to Exotech today?
**Gtjones**: I might be.
**Gtjones**: I can probably put together a quick markup today.
**Gtjones**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Awesome.
**Jdawson**: So, yeah, Brandon, what we'll do is.
**Bclymer**: We'Ll get that out today.
**Jdawson**: To Exotech.
**Jdawson**: We'll have you guys cc'd on the email so you guys have some sort of visibility.
**Jdawson**: As soon as Joe or, or Cody confirms, then you guys are good to go to run with that.
**Bcritzman**: Okay, perfect.
**Bcritzman**: Yeah, we'll be on the lookout for it and then we'll, we'll be as speedy as possible to, to get it all priced up and figured out in time so that we know.
**Aelkarrimy**: I gotta see what the lead time is to get these transformers.
**Bcritzman**: Yeah, that's what we'll.
**Bcritzman**: That's why I say as soon as they send it to us, then we'll double check to make sure that you know what the lead time implications are and everything.
**Jdawson**: Brian, do we know roughly what we're looking for?
**Jdawson**: Like the sizes that will change.
**Jdawson**: So then this way maybe Tim can be proactive and start looking at what are the lead times and whatnot.
**Jdawson**: Like the 75 that needs to go up to 112.
**Jdawson**: So like should he look at a transformer that goes to 112 now?
**Gtjones**: Yeah, we're going to need two 45s, 375s and three one 12 and a half.
**Gtjones**: Three.
**Gtjones**: Three and two is six is eight.
**Gtjones**: So that's right.
**Gtjones**: Yeah.
**Gtjones**: 245.
**Gtjones**: Sorry, I was just going to repeat that.
**Gtjones**: 245.
**Gtjones**: 375.
**Gtjones**: 3112 and a half.
**Bcritzman**: Okay, got it.
**Gtjones**: Three, one 12 and a half.
**Aelkarrimy**: They're going to be moving up from them so the 75s can be replaced for that.
**Aelkarrimy**: Correct.
**Aelkarrimy**: That makes sense because right now we're moving the 75s up to 112.
**Aelkarrimy**: So we'll have three of those that we can replace with the ones that's bumping up to 75.
**Jdawson**: Correct.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay, we're good.
**Bcritzman**: Perfect.
**Bcritzman**: We'll get to work.
**Gtjones**: Thanks everyone.
**Bcritzman**: Thanks everyone.
**Bschwartz**: I'm sorry.
**Bschwartz**: So quick question.
**Bschwartz**: Leon from exotech.
**Bschwartz**: So Joey's off today.
**Bschwartz**: He'll be back next week, Wednesday.
**Bschwartz**: But I just wanted to confirm what, what your expectations are from exotech.
**Bschwartz**: So this mock up document will be sent to exotech and you're expecting a confirmation by end of day Monday?
**Gtjones**: Yes.
**Gtjones**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Midday would be phenomenal because we're going to send it out today.
**Jdawson**: So if you guys can.
**Jdawson**: Sooner we get this, the more.
**Jdawson**: And depending on the lead time, we try to stay on schedule.
**Jdawson**: That's the goal.
**Bschwartz**: Okay.
**Bschwartz**: All right, sounds good.
**Bschwartz**: Thank you so much.
**Bclymer**: Thanks Leon.
**Jdawson**: Thanks everyone.
