## Transcript
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Different every time.
**Bclymer**: Hey, Jesse, Nick, Andrew.
**Njepson**: That new link worked.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: What?
**Jdawson**: Be sure.
**Jdawson**: I'm glad Jared's not here to tell me how much this board cost and it's not working.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: It'S definitely user error.
**Bclymer**: But.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Coming up, I was there at Michigan street given so many grief over the cones blocking the former donation.
**Bclymer**: Oh yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Now that gate looks nice.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: I see what he was saying.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Gosh, it's so weird.
**Jdawson**: Just share this one.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: What's up, Brandon?
**Bclymer**: Howdy.
**Jdawson**: Can you guys see that?
**Njepson**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: It worked.
**Bclymer**: Well.
**Jdawson**: I guess we'll start with any changes would like to see.
**Jdawson**: I know we want.
**Jdawson**: I think we want to try and do something with this front shared office to make the entrance a little more open.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Me and Corey were just talking about that.
**Cemery**: Can you.
**Jdawson**: So I don't know if we can.
**Cemery**: Can you flatten it and make it.
**Cemery**: Can you flatten it and make it one office instead of two offices?
**Cemery**: Or the office on the left becomes the MOA's desk with opening and the office on the right stays like a coach's office.
**Cemery**: Yeah, I don't know if that would work, but.
**Jdawson**: So make this MOA with.
**Bclymer**: This.
**Jdawson**: So this is the MOA right now.
**Cemery**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Because it has access to the vestige rule.
**Jdawson**: So if it was here, wouldn't really have any easy access to this festival area.
**Jdawson**: I was thinking is there's this big open space up here.
**Jdawson**: So I don't know if there's a way we can either move the staff break room up here, reconfigure this a.
**Bclymer**: Little bit, and then.
**Jdawson**: And then move these down in this area to just have this totally open.
**Cemery**: I do.
**Cemery**: Corey and I were talking.
**Cemery**: I do.
**Cemery**: We do like the faculty on the floor plan too.
**Cemery**: Like in the back.
**Jdawson**: So back here?
**Cemery**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: You do like the faculty back there.
**Cemery**: Do you?
**Cemery**: Let me double check it again.
**Bclymer**: Because it's.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: It's really been, I think what I've been calling floor plan.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Oh, no, it's like a floor plan too.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: It's really large on that one.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: And I think you and I agree on floor plan one.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: It's much smaller and at the front of the building.
**Cemery**: Yeah, I think we keep the same size, I think in floor plan two, like make classroom five bigger, but keep the faculty lounge there in the back.
**Cemery**: Do you see what I'm saying?
**Cemery**: Like instead of eating.
**Cemery**: Instead of eating into Classroom 5 to accommodate the faculty lounge, eat into the faculty lounge to accommodate the bathrooms, if possible.
**Cemery**: I don't know if that makes sense.
**Cemery**: What are you saying?
**Jdawson**: I think this is the most recent one.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: So the PDF that was on the calendar 1M option was shooting.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Essentially.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: The difference is I could notice and I'm sure our friends from alleatogroup would fix this, but it's whether or not to include storage and shrink the middle section.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: And then it moves the faculty from the front to the back or the back to the front between one and two.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: And so at two.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: So what she's saying, this was one.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: What she's saying is this one puts like straight classrooms on both sides.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: And then five is up here.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Let's keep this the same, but maybe move this set this way to make that even.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: You see what I'm saying?
**Bclymer**: Gotcha.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: And then we could keep that.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Configure that configuration.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Feels great from a classroom standpoint.
**Bclymer**: Let me try and find that one.
**Jdawson**: I don't know why that wasn't on here.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: I know we're probably.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: These are two great iterations of anderson floor plan on this square.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: And I feel like Miriam and I are about to Goldilocks the two.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Jdawson**: I don't have it on here now.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Let me see if I can pull.
**Jdawson**: It up on the calendar.
**Njepson**: Do you want me to just email it to you?
**Njepson**: Andrew?
**Bclymer**: This.
**Bclymer**: This one.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: So this one from a Miriam.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Are you saying what we're looking at?
**Cemery**: Yeah.
**Cemery**: So see how Classroom 5 at the top corner there?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: So this one.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Bend this in.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Shouldn't be touching.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Keep my pen in my pocket.
**Jdawson**: You can do this if you want.
**Jdawson**: So yeah, I see it now.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: So drag in and make five equal to the other ones.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Although it is significantly longer.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Miriam.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: It's like 8ft longer than the other one.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: So we might.
**Cemery**: Then can you twist the bathroom sideways and make it like a. I don't know.
**Cemery**: Maybe that's not a good idea.
**Jdawson**: Would you want this storage accessible from the hallway or the faculty side?
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Actually, so you see what you're saying, you could make storage right from the hallway.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: I don't know if we can put a single bathroom.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Cemery**: I would prefer that.
**Cemery**: Sorry.
**Cemery**: Corey's point about Goldilocks and things.
**Cemery**: Try not to do that.
**Cemery**: So thank you for that call up for you.
**Cemery**: Bathroom doors into the faculty lounge.
**Cemery**: I don't love like having them in a hallway.
**Cemery**: I think are great because if someone goes to the bathroom during lunchtime, that can cause some issues too.
**Cemery**: That's the only thing I'm thinking.
**Jdawson**: True, true.
**Jdawson**: Or after lunchtime.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: You want to detail you.
**Cemery**: You get what I'm saying?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: Restrooms in the hallway, kind of in the center there.
**Njepson**: And then Take those shared offices and push them.
**Njepson**: You know, maybe either.
**Jdawson**: I don't know if you can enter them from the faculty or we can push them somewhere to the side.
**Njepson**: Well, if the faculty say, you know, the classroom bathrooms aren't in there anymore, and the bathrooms, you know, you got the closet, then two bathrooms into the hallway, and then the faculty kind of wraps around it.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Njepson**: Like, you walk in, like a little hall to get past the bathrooms.
**Njepson**: Then it would be that whole area behind, which would still be pretty big.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I remember what that one looks like.
**Cemery**: That red box in the wild.
**Cemery**: Yes.
**Cemery**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, so that's what I was going.
**Jdawson**: To say is the.
**Jdawson**: They'll need one in the wild.
**Jdawson**: CC and then washer dryer.
**Cemery**: Well.
**Jdawson**: This too big washer dryer.
**Jdawson**: So I don't know if you just piggyback off that so the plumbing's all together for staff bathroom, then you would gain that whole area here.
**Jdawson**: If you want to make that classrooms or part of that classroom.
**Bclymer**: And then.
**Jdawson**: Have storage or something right here inside the faculty break room.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Hey, Miriam, the classroom five, as drawn on this one, has the exact same square footage as the other ones.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Or maybe not exact, but like within 10ft.
**Cemery**: Sure.
**Cemery**: Okay.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: I. I didn't see it when you and I were chatting back and forth, how deep it was compared to the other ones.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: And based on my rounding on inches that could be off there.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: But.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: But if that.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Then I wonder if that whole set goes to the center then.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: And you have water on both sides.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: We could just slide that whole thing that way and then put.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah, the faculty is still big, so we could even steal room for YLCC out of the faculty.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Would you rather have that?
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah, since we don't need it for the class.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Miriam, do you think we just give the YLCC more space to put in this closet?
**Cemery**: I think so.
**Cemery**: Am I seeing storage in every classroom, like at Anderson?
**Jdawson**: Looks like it, yeah.
**Cemery**: Okay.
**Cemery**: Yeah, I think it's fine.
**Cemery**: I remember that was one of Steve's requests.
**Cemery**: Right.
**Cemery**: It's like there's no.
**Cemery**: Literally no storage for them in goodwillindy currently.
**Cemery**: And so what does that look like?
**Cemery**: And I know in Anderson they've turned one of those into like a food pantry and one of those into, like the copy staff room.
**Cemery**: So I think we can utilize those also in different ways than just storage.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Oh, that's right.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: We put some doors to the hallway instead of inside the classroom.
**Cemery**: Yes, yes.
**Cemery**: And I would say we should think through that again, same way, Corey, because I don't want to have to go disrupt a class every time I need to go into the food pantry for a student or something, you know?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: It makes them more versatile.
**Cemery**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: So you want to make all these interior storage doors in the hallway?
**Cemery**: Not all.
**Cemery**: I don't think all of them need that, but.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: One.
**Jdawson**: Just one.
**Jdawson**: So they all have two.
**Jdawson**: So just make one to the hallway.
**Cemery**: Sure.
**Jdawson**: Or these side do.
**Jdawson**: At least there's nothing on this side.
**Cemery**: How do the classrooms.
**Cemery**: This classroom square footage on the left side compare to the right side?
**Cemery**: Is it the same?
**Cemery**: Like, do the storage boxes take out classroom space that the other side has?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, they're pretty close.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: I was only doing the.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Does that 29 go all the way to the end?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, right.
**Jdawson**: Here's 29.
**Bclymer**: Oh, yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Then it's.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: It's about the same.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: So that's 690.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah, that side is like 690 something.
**Jdawson**: 29 by 33 and then 30 by 33.
**Cemery**: And that excludes the storage, is what you're saying?
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Cemery**: Perfect.
**Cemery**: Okay.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: And then classroom five is actually just nominally a little bit bigger, but it's the only one that doesn't have this, like, uniform, perfect shape.
**Jdawson**: And I don't know if you guys do the same thing, but, like, at bktcsap, they called it the resource room, where it was kind of bigger than everything else, where it was like their computer lab, slash, random.
**Jdawson**: Whatever they needed.
**Bclymer**: Got it.
**Jdawson**: So I don't know if that's something you want to just.
**Jdawson**: Just make that bigger.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Interesting.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: It's depending on how much we need to steal for this or.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: I could.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: I would make that my CCR room.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Or, you know, it's kind of whatever.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Janitor, do you want the double doors like Anderson, or.
**Jdawson**: Is single okay?
**Cemery**: Single.
**Cemery**: Single is fine.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: No friend scores for knowledge.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: I think our main note on this one was the classroom five, which we've resolved.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: We banned the stuff to the yc.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Is that bathroom down by the director's office?
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Would rather just complete the loop there, not have that one down there.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: M.
**Cemery**: Correct.
**Cemery**: Yeah.
**Cemery**: Eliminate that bathroom at the bottom by the director's office.
**Cemery**: So that.
**Cemery**: Yeah.
**Cemery**: Just a full loop.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Cemery**: Is it possible to make that shared office on the left there at the bottom, the reception area, so that as soon as they walk in the vestibule, they're talking with the moa.
**Cemery**: Because if.
**Cemery**: If we put the MOA right there, she can also see into the door.
**Cemery**: Yeah.
**Cemery**: Move reception across little hallway to the shared office.
**Cemery**: Open that shared office up to be like a countertop, you know, like a 90 degree, you know, right angle, countertop there, both sides.
**Cemery**: She can.
**Cemery**: She can also see who's walking in the door.
**Cemery**: Right?
**Cemery**: Because I'm not sure.
**Cemery**: I know we did in Grant county the vestibule window thing.
**Cemery**: I'm not sure.
**Cemery**: Or we didn't do it.
**Cemery**: They have the.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we did a window, like a sliding window that you can talk through, enhance stuff through.
**Bclymer**: The.
**Jdawson**: It's whatever you guys want.
**Jdawson**: At the other schools, they've been wanting this set up more.
**Jdawson**: So I don't know, it's up to you guys what you want for your specific school.
**Jdawson**: So like at Anderson, it's.
**Jdawson**: It's totally different where.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, you can see straight through and then they have that countertop in front of.
**Jdawson**: So we.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we can make this more open where it's just the countertop.
**Jdawson**: And that'll make this feel more open.
**Jdawson**: Coming through here too.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: What, Miriam, what do you think if we flip reception and directors up there and then put the shared offices where reception and directors are.
**Cemery**: Yeah.
**Cemery**: A director right across from moa.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Here.
**Cemery**: And then the scoop coaches down to classroom nine.
**Cemery**: That other shared office.
**Cemery**: Down to classroom nine.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: I was just thinking flip these two.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: So that would be reception.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: That would be director.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: This would be shared office.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: This would be shared office.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Cemery**: Yeah.
**Cemery**: They get director really small, but I think that's.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: But I missed all your drawing.
**Bclymer**: Weird.
**Jdawson**: All right, well, what part r it.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Me or ruined it?
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: These are much bigger than these though, aren't they?
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Like, can we get the number of desks.
**Jdawson**: You want to draw as a laser pointer?
**Cemery**: Let's think about who else.
**Cemery**: Who are we doing shared office with?
**Cemery**: Like, we need a coach's office and then essentially like an admin office.
**Cemery**: Like a lead teacher, lead coach, cpr.
**Cemery**: Is that what you're thinking, Corey?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Cemery**: Like two offices, right?
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: So that.
**Bclymer**: What?
**Jdawson**: Two.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Something like that.
**Jdawson**: They want two separate shut offs is not one.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, kind of.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Exactly how that one was.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: I just don't know if there's enough room for it in all of that.
**Cemery**: Yeah.
**Cemery**: I also don't always love that all the staff are at the very front.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Cemery**: I don't know.
**Cemery**: How big is that janitor's closet?
**Cemery**: It looks the same size as the director's office.
**Cemery**: So I'm just checking that.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: I see what you're saying.
**Jdawson**: It's larger.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I mean, the janitors is.
**Jdawson**: Is pretty similar to director size.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: We can keep the director office for one shared and then make that janitor and then make that shared.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: I don't know if that's big enough, though.
**Cemery**: Well, one office is going to have two coaches, and the other office may have two or three.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Cemery**: Ellie works mostly.
**Cemery**: I mean, these are specific people, but CGR is all a lot of.
**Cemery**: In the classroom.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Cemery**: My.
**Cemery**: My suggestion.
**Cemery**: But keep MOA where you have it.
**Cemery**: Keep him away where you have it.
**Cemery**: And then move the shared office where you have director keep.
**Cemery**: Put the shared office there.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: No, I got you.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: I was.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: I.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: And this then stays shared.
**Cemery**: Yeah, that can be a coach's office.
**Cemery**: Which director in reception.
**Cemery**: So the director is right outside the MOA and right next to the vestibule.
**Cemery**: And then make the reception that janitor.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: So director here.
**Cemery**: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Cemery**: Red dot.
**Cemery**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: This is fun.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: That stays shared.
**Jdawson**: Janitors is it usually has a mop sink in it.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: That's the only water that'll be up there.
**Jdawson**: So leaving it close to the bathrooms.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: All that run for one.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: But put in the electrical room.
**Bclymer**: On.
**Cemery**: The back of the faculty lounge.
**Cemery**: They make the janitor's closet up here.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Replace the water closet with one.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: So this could become a conference room then.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: We don't have a conference room on here.
**Cemery**: Yeah, they have a conference room right there.
**Cemery**: Are you saying cut classroom?
**Cemery**: Oh, wait, where are your other coaches going?
**Cemery**: Oh, wait.
**Cemery**: Got it, got it, got it.
**Cemery**: I see you.
**Jdawson**: Is that resource room?
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah, we have a resource room in the middle.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Depending on how Steve uses that, you know that that could be functionally in a classroom with both of all three of those tors.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: And this becomes a coach office, too.
**Cemery**: Yeah.
**Cemery**: What is that right now?
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Resource room.
**Cemery**: Oh, next to the computer left.
**Cemery**: Yep.
**Cemery**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: So the idea.
**Cemery**: Can you throw the janitor's closet back to the back of the faculty is.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: There was some square footage here with.
**Jdawson**: Just right here through that other.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Because this then would move over here, and then on both sides of the wall, we have washer, dryer, water closet, and then janitor water closet.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Something like that.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: So, yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: This whole bracket moves that way.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Cemery**: I put the water closet in the front.
**Cemery**: So the door could be into the hallway.
**Cemery**: Yeah.
**Cemery**: Okay, cool.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Do we have it?
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Thanks for letting me take it.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: I stayed very disciplined last time.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: I didn't get up.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: No, I didn't.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: I got it.
**Cemery**: Quick question.
**Cemery**: When we're.
**Cemery**: That the bathrooms that we're moving to the.
**Cemery**: To the other side of the faculty lounge, what does that become?
**Cemery**: Does that just give Classroom 6 more options, or is that a storage hallway?
**Cemery**: What does that become?
**Jdawson**: Said classroom six Right here.
**Cemery**: No, sorry.
**Cemery**: Classroom.
**Cemery**: What's the top left?
**Cemery**: Yeah.
**Cemery**: Did we just expand that when we move the bathroom?
**Cemery**: Is that what we're doing?
**Bclymer**: No.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: The faculty wall will scoot over to the current water closet wall.
**Cemery**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Class five, as drawn is the same space as the other classrooms.
**Cemery**: Okay.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: So that wall will just be the leading edge of the faculty.
**Cemery**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: We've jammed it over here somewhere.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I wasn't trying to get the door out here for the restroom.
**Jdawson**: And then I could do janitor here.
**Jdawson**: So it's just kind of like a. I don't know if you wanted me to go through the lounge to get to the janitor's closet.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Oh, right.
**Bclymer**: Go ahead.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah, I can open to the hall.
**Cemery**: Here's a crazy.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: You know what's crazy is currently Noblesville does not have a janitor.
**Cemery**: I know.
**Jdawson**: Does the school take care of it?
**Jdawson**: School takes care of Ivy Tech and.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Then Ivy Tech takes care of some things.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: So that's something we're going to have to address, Miriam, as we move over here.
**Cemery**: Yeah, I have a.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: This is about the next 20 years.
**Cemery**: When we think about someone coming in to talk to the MOA and that kind of stuff, there isn't very much a seating area for someone to sit down because they need the director's office.
**Cemery**: So what if the top storage in classroom one, that's right across from the moa, what if that just becomes like an inlet where we can put some chairs and that closet.
**Cemery**: Not the full one, just.
**Cemery**: Well, just the part that's in classroom one.
**Cemery**: So that little square that's in classroom one becomes like the greeting area where students can like sit or something like that.
**Cemery**: Is there an issue with that, do we think?
**Cemery**: Not the whole thing.
**Cemery**: Not the whole thing.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Steve Montgomery.
**Cemery**: Cut that in half.
**Jdawson**: So just like, I think it could.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Do the whole thing.
**Jdawson**: It'd only be like two chairs, probably.
**Cemery**: Yeah, that's the point.
**Cemery**: Yeah.
**Cemery**: Yeah.
**Cemery**: I think.
**Cemery**: Teacher Corey.
**Cemery**: The only thing about the whole.
**Cemery**: The whole thing is I don't want it to go into the student lounge, you know, and then we have go.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Where.
**Cemery**: I don't want.
**Cemery**: I wasn't thinking about the whole greeting area.
**Cemery**: To go over into the student lounge where they can see and be in part of the student lounge.
**Cemery**: You know what I mean?
**Jdawson**: So, yeah, they'll just be right all in everything.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: I got you.
**Cemery**: Right.
**Cemery**: Like, so if you just cut it off halfway and even build like a half wall there kind of thing, like.
**Cemery**: Like all the way out.
**Cemery**: Continue to build it out so it looks like A separation.
**Cemery**: Does that make sense?
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah, no, I follow.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Because if we're doing a longer like enrollment appointment, the conference room is there, the director is there.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: There's plenty of places to do a longer condo or if there's more people.
**Cemery**: Right.
**Cemery**: But like to sit down and fill out an application or wait or something.
**Cemery**: And wait for.
**Cemery**: There's not even.
**Cemery**: There's just not a waiting area.
**Cemery**: Right.
**Cemery**: Let me go get your coach for you.
**Cemery**: And I have to walk all the way over there or whatever.
**Cemery**: There's nowhere to.
**Jdawson**: Do you want them.
**Jdawson**: Do you want them to be in the secured area while they do that or do you want them to be in the vestibule area?
**Jdawson**: Like you can put chairs and get rid of this storage and put the chairs and stuff there.
**Cemery**: That's how Grant county is.
**Cemery**: And that feels very.
**Bclymer**: Not welcoming.
**Cemery**: Yes, yes.
**Cemery**: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Cemery**: And.
**Cemery**: But that wall comes all the way out to parallel all the rest of the walls right in that hallway so that there's like there's just no closed in storage.
**Cemery**: Does that make sense?
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: So, yeah, that's some depth.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: For chairs.
**Cemery**: Yes, yes.
**Cemery**: Sunk in.
**Cemery**: Is that what you said?
**Cemery**: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: And if we look at the footage there and it's not enough, we can expand it, but.
**Jdawson**: And just seats or like table and stuff to work at, like a computer.
**Jdawson**: I know some.
**Jdawson**: The Bloomington, they have like computers in front or stuff.
**Cemery**: I do.
**Cemery**: Also, just a quick question.
**Cemery**: If I'm remembering correctly and.
**Cemery**: And Anderson isn't there.
**Cemery**: Aren't those all.
**Cemery**: Aren't all the classroom doors like sunk in to be parallel with where the storage starts or am I imagining that?
**Cemery**: Corey, you were just there last week.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah, I don't remember.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: I don't know what you mean though.
**Jdawson**: You mean on the storage side having the doors here?
**Cemery**: Yeah.
**Cemery**: Are they like that in Anderson?
**Cemery**: I can't remember.
**Jdawson**: I think maybe.
**Jdawson**: I think, Yeah, I think the left side is kind of like how it is here.
**Bclymer**: I think they are.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Cemery**: They are sunken.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: I think they are.
**Jdawson**: Anderson.
**Cemery**: Yes, I think they are too.
**Bclymer**: Because.
**Cemery**: The reason I asked that is because then down in this visiting area, you wouldn't have to necessarily have that wall on the bottom to make it feel very claustrophobic.
**Cemery**: Right.
**Cemery**: You could just leave that wall.
**Cemery**: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: That helped open it up.
**Cemery**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: We get rid of those walls.
**Cemery**: Yeah.
**Cemery**: Yep, yep.
**Cemery**: But again, I don't remember where the doors are in Anderson.
**Jdawson**: I mean, either way it's not really usable space.
**Cemery**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Right here.
**Jdawson**: Except for the closets being there.
**Jdawson**: So having the Doors here.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, It'll make it a little more open.
**Jdawson**: The storage door.
**Jdawson**: I think so.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: These storage doors ought to be.
**Bclymer**: Here.
**Jdawson**: But in that classroom.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Any other floor plan stuff, Miriam?
**Cemery**: I think I have reached my quota of suggestion.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: There are no windows on that outside wall, right?
**Jdawson**: Currently, no, but we have transoms.
**Jdawson**: So not full size windows, but just the high windows.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And then we can we do transoms in here as well.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: To get that natural light coming through.
**Bclymer**: That makes sense.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Is it an all glass front?
**Bclymer**: Currently, no.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: I can't remember.
**Jdawson**: No, there's actually no windows here either.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So if you wanted to add it.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: I don't know cost.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Because we're listening.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: But yeah, I think as much light as possible.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Particularly since the whole left side of the plan, there's no option to.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So kind of like Grant county is what we did.
**Jdawson**: We had transoms in all the bathroom or bathrooms.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Classrooms.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: You know, we're not gonna complex like we did with Anderson and have skylights or 30 foot windows.
**Jdawson**: Do you guys want any exterior windows?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I think we'll want to do similar to what we did at BART and Grant.
**Jdawson**: Oh, you guys had bktcsap, so just the transom windows on the inside.
**Jdawson**: On the exterior walls and the inside classrooms.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: We talked about an exterior door for YLCC or is that.
**Jdawson**: We did not talk about it.
**Jdawson**: We mentioned it last time.
**Jdawson**: I don't know if you guys had a for sure answer on that.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Well, I think the door is right there by the other.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: I think we're good.
**Bclymer**: The.
**Jdawson**: I think this is only for the electrical room in this drawing.
**Jdawson**: So there's a door right here.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Oh, the door's over there.
**Jdawson**: But you could do that where you just close off.
**Jdawson**: Electrical room.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Barring code questions up there for both YCC and the electrical.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah, yeah, that would be my.
**Jdawson**: And would you actually have students come or YCC kids come through there just in emergencies.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: That would be where they go through for fire.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Detach and all the.
**Bclymer**: You know.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Unless somebody from Hamilton county shows up and says we have to have.
**Jdawson**: I mean we could.
**Bclymer**: Then that would be.
**Jdawson**: We could put it.
**Jdawson**: You don't want it in the room, do you?
**Jdawson**: Then kids will open it.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Cemery**: I would advocate for a window on the back.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Transom.
**Cemery**: Yeah.
**Cemery**: Not like a window Ohio, but like a window that kids can see out of.
**Cemery**: And then we can put like the Whatever.
**Cemery**: Window protector, whatever.
**Cemery**: So that like a black.
**Cemery**: I don't remember what it's called.
**Cemery**: Like the window screen you can put on it.
**Cemery**: So it's like you can't see in it, you know?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Cemery**: From a safety standpoint.
**Cemery**: But I know natural light for the kiddos is really actually helpful with like, regulating their nap times and, you know, all the things.
**Cemery**: Right?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: So the.
**Jdawson**: You said with the window film.
**Cemery**: Yeah.
**Cemery**: Where like, they can still.
**Cemery**: I would say yes.
**Cemery**: From a safety standpoint.
**Cemery**: Right.
**Cemery**: We don't want people to just look in and see there's a bunch of kids in there.
**Cemery**: But also we want, like, kids to be able to see out and look at the trees or, you know, the thing.
**Cemery**: I know.
**Jdawson**: So I think.
**Jdawson**: I don't know what we're gonna do with this building yet, but there's something might.
**Jdawson**: There might be another tenant here where this is their entrance.
**Jdawson**: Then I don't know what that looks like yet.
**Cemery**: If that's okay.
**Cemery**: If it happens, then could you just put it on the side?
**Cemery**: The other side?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Or at least have that bigger window and then that film most the way up and leave the top open.
**Jdawson**: So you can't see in, but you can see out.
**Cemery**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jdawson**: I saw this.
**Cemery**: Wait, it's frosted.
**Cemery**: The same thing as frosted in my mind.
**Cemery**: You can't see out of.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Bclymer**: The.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Bclymer**: So I get.
**Jdawson**: This is the window frost the bottom.
**Cemery**: No, My.
**Cemery**: My goal would be like, there's that really tiny little, like.
**Cemery**: It's like a black film that has little, tiny little holes in it so you actually can see out.
**Cemery**: You know what I'm talking about?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**Cemery**: I want.
**Cemery**: The goal is I want kids to be able to see out because they.
**Cemery**: I mean, it doesn't have to be, but I.
**Cemery**: In my experience working with kiddos, being able to show them outside when they're elevated or, you know, just trying to distract away from mom walking out of the classroom.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: Autozone is gone, right, Andrew?
**Jdawson**: No, it's there.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Oh, yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Autozone.
**Jdawson**: Whatever solution we find, this will be it.
**Cemery**: Thanks, Andrew.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Then do you want.
**Jdawson**: Keep this window.
**Jdawson**: Two windows, more light or just the one?
**Cemery**: One is fine.
**Cemery**: But we talked about maybe depending on if we have a tenant that needs to use that and you don't necessarily need that one open.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: I don't know if we'll have that answer at that time anyway.
**Njepson**: And Andrew, initially there was talk about do they just want that.
**Njepson**: The door to go from.
**Njepson**: To the.
**Njepson**: The YLCC directly outside, or do they.
**Njepson**: If they want to take the kids out, they would take them out and down.
**Njepson**: Yeah, that corridor.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I don't you don't want to do an exterior door inside the ycc, right?
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Cemery**: Correct.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: That's our.
**Jdawson**: Because the kids will find a way to break out.
**Cemery**: Is there space in the student center for like a sink and fridge hookup and those kinds of things?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Njepson**: And the faculty lines that'll have the sink and fridge and all of that as well.
**Cemery**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Anything else?
**Jdawson**: Bathrooms.
**Jdawson**: You go with the entrance being back in there.
**Jdawson**: Does it really matter for you guys.
**Cemery**: If.
**Cemery**: If you can have them on the sides at the end?
**Cemery**: I think that'll be best.
**Cemery**: Because you can't see what's happening when they go in the back.
**Cemery**: Right.
**Cemery**: Versus if I.
**Cemery**: If you're going in on the hallway side.
**Cemery**: I can see what's happening.
**Jdawson**: Or do you want to flip this completely?
**Jdawson**: Bathrooms down here connected to the student lounge?
**Cemery**: No, I don't.
**Cemery**: I don't think that's necessary.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Miriam?
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: I don't know.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: I don't know how to make the bathroom functional with a door on the side of that.
**Cemery**: Well, can you put it on the corner?
**Cemery**: Yeah, like right there at the very.
**Cemery**: Yeah, on there.
**Cemery**: And then they walk.
**Cemery**: Oh, were you just doing an open hallway?
**Jdawson**: That's what we have been doing.
**Bclymer**: The AT bar.
**Jdawson**: We did that in that Southeast Excel.
**Jdawson**: There's no doors.
**Jdawson**: It's just kind of like an open area.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: We taking the doors off anyways.
**Cemery**: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Cemery**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, Jesse, if there's a way to do the way we did, BART bathrooms in that area.
**Njepson**: Yeah, yeah.
**Njepson**: If they.
**Njepson**: They were configured the way they are now, that whole land would be open and they would just walk.
**Cemery**: Got it.
**Njepson**: Go right or left.
**Cemery**: Okay.
**Cemery**: Okay, that's fine.
**Njepson**: And is that enough?
**Njepson**: In the women's restroom, there's just three stalls.
**Njepson**: Trying to think what we had at the other ones.
**Cemery**: I think there's only three stalls right now.
**Cemery**: Anyway.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Cemery**: For the shared office in the back.
**Cemery**: Can we put that door opening on.
**Cemery**: In the big hallway?
**Bclymer**: Yes, like that.
**Cemery**: I'd move it to the top.
**Cemery**: They come out right where the bathrooms are, you know?
**Jdawson**: Gotcha.
**Jdawson**: Oh, clear screen.
**Bclymer**: Don't want to do that.
**Jdawson**: This eraser's too big.
**Cemery**: Perfect.
**Jdawson**: Do you like at.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, love that.
**Jdawson**: Open in.
**Jdawson**: Do you want a window in that?
**Jdawson**: Kind of like you did at Grant county where they can see.
**Cemery**: Yeah, that might be helpful.
**Cemery**: Right there next to the door.
**Cemery**: I would put it.
**Jdawson**: In.
**Jdawson**: A full size window.
**Cemery**: Is pretty big.
**Cemery**: It doesn't necessarily need to be that big.
**Cemery**: I don't think it needs to be that big.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: You want that on the resource room in computer lab too.
**Cemery**: Oh yeah, we talked about that, didn't we?
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Looks like it might already be there on the computer lab.
**Cemery**: That wall between the computer.
**Cemery**: Are you talking about the wall between the computer lab and the resource room, Corey?
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: No.
**Jdawson**: Do you want this resource room window to look into that?
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: I don't think the kitchen app.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: That window makes sense.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Oh, I see what I'm saying.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Miriam is saying in between the resource and computer lab.
**Bclymer**: Oh, okay.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: I just don't know that locks those in functionally forever.
**Jdawson**: True.
**Cemery**: Now what?
**Cemery**: What do you think?
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Well, just it locks the.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: That use like in two years.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: It's not going to put a curtain.
**Jdawson**: Up if you want like a classroom at some point.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: But I think big windows will get into those next.
**Cemery**: On either side of the computer lab.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah, that window's right.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I mean we can do transoms too, but you wouldn't see out of them.
**Jdawson**: Just that.
**Jdawson**: Just for natural light.
**Cemery**: There is a window on the computer lab.
**Cemery**: Is that correct?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, looks like it.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Towards class seven.
**Cemery**: Okay.
**Cemery**: Hey, Corey, the resource room in Anderson has a door on either side, which I think is helpful.
**Cemery**: Do we want to do that in this resource room or no?
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Software.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: I think I'm next up.
**Cemery**: What does the entrance into the MOA space look like?
**Cemery**: What the entrance like, is there like the swinging like saloon door on the edge of that?
**Cemery**: Is that just gonna be an open space?
**Cemery**: What does that look like?
**Jdawson**: I never like the swinging doors just because they're a maintenance headache.
**Jdawson**: But I like what we did a.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Grant like an opening on the other sides.
**Cemery**: Can you put the.
**Cemery**: The open space or door, whichever we decide to, right against the student lounge?
**Cemery**: Yeah, against that.
**Cemery**: It's a 90 degree counter.
**Cemery**: Right.
**Jdawson**: This is the counter area.
**Jdawson**: I mean you could have it go all the way around if you want with a.
**Jdawson**: Like a.
**Bclymer**: Like a bar.
**Bclymer**: But.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Cemery**: Are you drawing on it?
**Cemery**: I can't see.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, it's just to the right of the.
**Jdawson**: Over here.
**Cemery**: Oh, okay.
**Cemery**: Sorry, I was zoomed in too much.
**Cemery**: Yes, perfect.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, like that and then.
**Bclymer**: Open.
**Cemery**: That's the wall there.
**Cemery**: That would be the wall, right?
**Cemery**: The wall behind the.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, right here.
**Cemery**: No.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that's the wall of.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And then you can have it open if you want.
**Bclymer**: Or.
**Cemery**: Quick question.
**Cemery**: The box.
**Cemery**: The box to the right that you just drew, is that the shared office?
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Cemery**: Okay, so the wall would not continue past the MOA desk.
**Jdawson**: Right here.
**Cemery**: Open into the student lounge?
**Cemery**: No, at the top.
**Cemery**: Are you saying she's just open into the student lounge?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So basically this will just all be open.
**Jdawson**: It'll just be the countertop workspace area.
**Cemery**: May I make a suggestion?
**Cemery**: Can we make.
**Cemery**: Can you extend the wall all the way out to the hallway?
**Cemery**: So the top of the shared office.
**Cemery**: Extend that.
**Cemery**: The top of the shirt go up.
**Cemery**: Pull that all the way out and that becomes that wall.
**Cemery**: The mural, that kind of thing.
**Cemery**: Right.
**Cemery**: Or with the other.
**Cemery**: Yep.
**Cemery**: And then now cut off a little bit of her desk at the top there.
**Jdawson**: We'll see if the ratio lets me.
**Cemery**: Yep, yep, yep.
**Cemery**: And then extend the wall back out.
**Cemery**: Yep.
**Cemery**: And then extend the wall.
**Cemery**: Yes, yes, yes, yes.
**Cemery**: Can we do that?
**Cemery**: That wall goes all the way to the top.
**Cemery**: Does that make sense?
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Cemery**: So it separates her from the student lounge.
**Jdawson**: Gotcha.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: The permanent police of the student road.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Cemery**: What?
**Cemery**: Corey.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: No, I see what you're doing.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Because otherwise the MOA would have to have constant supervision on that.
**Cemery**: Right, right.
**Cemery**: And that's a.
**Cemery**: That's been a point of.
**Cemery**: Of tension in Grant county right now.
**Bclymer**: Gotcha.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Okay, now we're.
**Bclymer**: Now.
**Bclymer**: For now.
**Cemery**: Yeah, sorry.
**Cemery**: I think that.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Davey wants me to talk about this at the extended leadership meeting on Friday.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: So I took a picture of that mess.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: My first slide will be the blank floor plan.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: The second slide will be this.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, no, this is great.
**Jdawson**: Because then it's all planned out in the beginning.
**Jdawson**: There shouldn't be as many zero or few change orders because we get it right first time.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Right, right.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: We just run into natural problems.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Oh, but I like this.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: And we've all done this enough now that we know what we're looking for and looking at.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, you'd think.
**Jdawson**: But you guys want opposite of what Lakia wants.
**Jdawson**: Some kind of sub.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: That's normal.
**Bclymer**: That's normal.
**Bclymer**: Cool.
**Jdawson**: Anything else you can think of on this?
**Jdawson**: And if you do think of something, you can always email us.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, we're.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: You were talking about this.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: You were talking about making this bigger.
**Jdawson**: Do these things actually go here?
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: That will fatigue.
**Jdawson**: You want to reconfigure that doodle?
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: And then the washer and dryer motor closet should be re given back to it from the faculty because that stuff won't exist.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that's right.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: So faculty will shift left.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Everything shifts left and replacing.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: I did a terrible job for hacketing input.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: An error.
**Bclymer**: But.
**Jdawson**: Can you screen grab this?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Normally I would put a square box over and just redraw it.
**Bclymer**: Hold on.
**Jdawson**: I don't remember where it was.
**Jdawson**: And then this was over here.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I got a whole L. Of.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Washer and dryer and water closets also.
**Jdawson**: So again, it's based on the.
**Jdawson**: I'm just gonna read it.
**Njepson**: And then.
**Jdawson**: Single door on the ylcc, right?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Do you.
**Jdawson**: We've talked about a Dutch door or something before.
**Jdawson**: I don't know if.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, the half door, so the kids can't get out, but you can have it open to see.
**Jdawson**: I don't know if you guys want that.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Cemery**: One of the requests that I would ask for is in the YLCC at Southeast, there is that, like, half wall that's built in the ylcc.
**Cemery**: I would love for us to be able to have that in this ylcc.
**Cemery**: I think that's a natural partition for older kids and littler kids.
**Cemery**: So it's really helpful to have.
**Cemery**: Instead of having to use bookcases to make the walls.
**Cemery**: Yeah.
**Cemery**: So I'm not really sold on where that is, but I think.
**Cemery**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Like, right in the half.
**Bclymer**: Or.
**Jdawson**: Do you want to go all the way across?
**Jdawson**: Or does that like an.
**Jdawson**: At bktcsap, we just did the wall like that and then open on the inside.
**Cemery**: Yeah, I think that's fine.
**Cemery**: Yeah.
**Cemery**: And is there.
**Cemery**: Go ahead.
**Jdawson**: Do you care which way it goes?
**Jdawson**: I like where it's located.
**Cemery**: I like that way.
**Cemery**: And is there a sink or anything going in for, like, a sink in a fridge?
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: I was just thinking about doing it right here.
**Cemery**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Kitchen.
**Jdawson**: Oh, I can't.
**Bclymer**: Oh, no.
**Jdawson**: We have been putting dishwashers in.
**Jdawson**: You still want that?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Dishwasher, fridge.
**Jdawson**: Think.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Typical combo cabinets above this thing.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Dishwasher.
**Jdawson**: I don't know if there'll be enough room in that spot, but somewhere in there.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: And alleatogroup knows what we want, so they'll figure it out.
**Cemery**: That's why I.
**Cemery**: That's why I.
**Njepson**: We will definitely figure it out.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: That's what you do.
**Jdawson**: Do you want this door like that.
**Bclymer**: Or do you want it straight?
**Jdawson**: Put a wall here, because that's not super us.
**Jdawson**: You want the faculty door right next to the school or the classroom?
**Jdawson**: Does that matter?
**Cemery**: I don't think that matters.
**Bclymer**: Okay, cool.
**Bclymer**: Well, anything else?
**Cemery**: Great.
**Bclymer**: Sweet.
**Jdawson**: Well, I'll screen grab this and send it out.
**Jdawson**: Anything you guys need to lead out.
**Njepson**: One thing.
**Njepson**: You talk about the storage in each classroom.
**Njepson**: Are we adding those to the ones on the right to make sure each classroom has a little storage closet?
**Cemery**: I would say no, because it's not necessarily storage for that specific teacher.
**Cemery**: It's like storage for the building.
**Cemery**: Because the way it happened at Anderson is that side of the Halls were so big that we just like, we're trying to eat up space.
**Cemery**: And so we put storage on that side kind of for the whole school, not just for those specific teachers.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: As just a comment, I'm noticing, like, they put little circles where the column lines are, and I've noticed a few conflicts.
**Njepson**: I know you like the post office and bktcsap.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: But it's like some of these rooms appear to have post in the middle of them, so.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Oh, there's a post in that reading area, isn't there?
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Purchase all the reading area here.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: I missed the post altogether.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: There's another post.
**Cemery**: There is a post in the waiting area.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Just in the storage next to it.
**Cemery**: Okay.
**Cemery**: Yeah, that's fine.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I wonder if the other ones are hidden in the wall maybe.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we can make this.
**Jdawson**: You can make this laundry Just the closet.
**Jdawson**: I think the only laundry you guys have is up here in the bc, right?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: I just didn't know if something came out of the bar or southeast where they had more space.
**Bclymer**: No.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Does Anderson like that?
**Bclymer**: I don't think.
**Bclymer**: I don't know.
**Cemery**: What's the question?
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Do we have a laundry in one of the storage rooms?
**Cemery**: No.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: I like.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: It's an interesting idea, though.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: We've done some things for people in the middle, like in the.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: In between.
**Cemery**: We did that in Anderson at the old Anderson.
**Cemery**: We had two washers and dryers back in the classroom.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Njepson**: Last thing.
**Njepson**: Andrew, can we look at the.
**Njepson**: And I can share if you want, but just for the front of the building and the side of the building as far as.
**Njepson**: See here.
**Bclymer**: I know.
**Jdawson**: Say this first.
**Bclymer**: Delete it all.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Press the two buttons on the side of the control.
**Jdawson**: Interesting.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Normally if it's on like the vibe canvas, it just is super easy.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: If you press the square with the arrow enter above the X and the left sign.
**Jdawson**: Oh, yeah, send it.
**Bclymer**: Look at that.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Worth the money.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: You're gonna give Miriam my beard?
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Is that's how she's gonna talk to me now?
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Where's the money?
**Jdawson**: I'll unshare if you want to share, Jesse.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Njepson**: It says I cannot share while others sharing.
**Bclymer**: Try again.
**Jdawson**: I just.
**Jdawson**: I just disconnected.
**Njepson**: Ah, there we go.
**Njepson**: So the.
**Njepson**: What were we doing with this whole front entry here?
**Njepson**: Like we're taking all of this out?
**Jdawson**: I don't know yet.
**Jdawson**: Don't know what it'll look like when the other tenant is in.
**Bclymer**: But they'll.
**Jdawson**: Definitely be a separate entrance.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Okay, that was.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: That entrance is already centered, right?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, it's pretty Much.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: We're going to have to shift to the.
**Jdawson**: I think when you guys designed this, did you make that front door?
**Jdawson**: The.
**Jdawson**: The door that's already existing?
**Njepson**: I think initially we were trying to.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: Where you come in to that vestibule.
**Njepson**: So I don't know how close it is now to where those doors are.
**Bclymer**: Is.
**Jdawson**: That's gonna.
**Jdawson**: I think it really is going to depend on who else leases the other side of the building.
**Jdawson**: What this will look.
**Bclymer**: Because.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: They would have to put in their whole new.
**Njepson**: Their own entrance over here somewhere, I think.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: I went to a school in Missouri that left.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: I think it was an old Lowe's that left like the retails over there.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: It was very bad.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I think if we.
**Jdawson**: If we leave it and have it like a shared entrance, it'll just be weird.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Because we have cloud service left of that entrance too.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that's true.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: I don't.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: We could just take the whole thing out.
**Bclymer**: That whole.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Is that precast building.
**Jdawson**: But this.
**Jdawson**: It looks like this was just added onto it.
**Jdawson**: The roof line and everything.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: This is all.
**Njepson**: They got some posts out here and this is just out of metal.
**Bclymer**: Like it.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: And center our sign so they can center theirs.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: Because.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I'd say let's see the cost of it first.
**Jdawson**: Just to get rid of that whole entrance, that roof line.
**Jdawson**: Just take everything back to the.
**Jdawson**: The block.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And then.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: We'll probably add an awning and then our sign.
**Njepson**: Will we need to build up the wall to fit any of your signage in there.
**Njepson**: Is this all going to fit in that height wall?
**Jdawson**: I think there's probably enough space for our signage.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: I was going to say we could probably go middle on our half and then have an entrance sign like we do at Anderson or UA Insurance.
**Cemery**: Right.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Where the sign is in the most visible place.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: The entrance is clearly marked.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Do a giant.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Sign to the right.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Kent is very upset about having a sign in Rome for the first time.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: I don't remember where we were.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Was it the board meeting?
**Bclymer**: Miriam.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: He was like Nobles will be moving locations where we will be able to have a sign and then like smile and then talked a little bit more because we're going to have a sign because we've been fighting Boys and Girls club and Sydney Roseville forever.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: So yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: I don't pass along higher ups.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Intentions very often.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Funny and intentional.
**Jdawson**: That was funny.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So yeah.
**Jdawson**: Take out the roof line that front entrance.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: And leave this other side.
**Njepson**: That's the other they may want.
**Jdawson**: No, I'd say take that out too.
**Njepson**: Just take this whole thing out.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: And then so our transom windows are going to go, you know, up about this height, I would imagine.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: And then they'll be along this back as well.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Njepson**: And then you got the.
**Njepson**: The daycare area window all the way in the back.
**Njepson**: That'll be more of a full height type thing or not full height, but.
**Jdawson**: A bigger width for them to look out.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Cemery**: Is there a standard size for the transoms windows?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I think they're all two foot by four foot.
**Njepson**: I think is what we put are mostly.
**Cemery**: Okay.
**Njepson**: The two foots is two foot's pretty standard size.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: And height.
**Jdawson**: At bktcsap, it was added after the fact, so it was whatever we could fit in there.
**Jdawson**: But these, we could do longer ones if we wanted, like two by eight.
**Cemery**: I don't know.
**Cemery**: Yeah, I think the more light the better.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Cemery**: And then are you leaving those two windows right there in the big lots?
**Cemery**: Are those going to stay?
**Cemery**: But they're the front.
**Cemery**: Good.
**Cemery**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: I don't think trying to get them to work out with this new office and classroom lineup in the front would be tough because it looks like they would end up like in the director's office and that conference room.
**Bclymer**: That would be fun.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, you can.
**Jdawson**: You can block those in.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Cemery**: Did you say black them in black.
**Jdawson**: Fill them with.
**Jdawson**: With blocks.
**Cemery**: Oh, I would rather keep them open.
**Bclymer**: Oh, you would?
**Cemery**: Yeah, yeah.
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: Works with the inside.
**Bclymer**: Like it's actually.
**Jdawson**: You want to be able to see in and out or do you want like the transcendence?
**C_1885bktcsap7oio5if5a039b0a5km**: I think a director view both ways would be great.
**Cemery**: Yeah.
**Cemery**: Like there's one in.
**Cemery**: There's one in Jenny's office in Grant county.
**Cemery**: And it's very helpful actually for Jenny to be able to see what's happening in the parking lot.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So if they don't.
**Jdawson**: So if it doesn't line up with the offices, add a window.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Njepson**: And then the rest of the exterior of this building, it's like looks like it's just.
**Njepson**: They painted a brick veneer on the front, the white area, and then they just painted the block on this side.
**Njepson**: Are you wanting to eat this?
**Njepson**: Any of this or just go with what's out there?
**Jdawson**: I think the only thing I could see is maybe we would want to do like an ethos over the entrance if we're going to make it taller for a bigger sign.
**Njepson**: For your signage is going.
**Jdawson**: Possibly that's the only I can see.
**Jdawson**: Otherwise we'll just probably paint it whatever color we're gonna paint, whatever Steve decides.
