**Ataylor**: I know, but they did the work and they didn't tell us.
**Ataylor**: They didn't even send us a price no.
**Gducharme**: Are they expecting payment for it, Nick?
**Kmass**: I would think so.

**Ataylor**: It's over with.
**Ataylor**: If I don't hear back from you by tomorrow, then we're disclosing it.

**Bclymer**: Yeah, cool.
**Bclymer**: I haven't seen that yet.
**Bclymer**: I'll check it tonight.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Here for the license is taking a lot of time.
**Jdawson**: Unfortunately our application is lost.
**Jdawson**: So they are actually trying to.
**Jdawson**: Not lost, but they're trying to kind of like allocate why it's not showing on the platform.
**Jdawson**: So Brandon already set up like a ticket to talk with it or the licensing department.
**Jdawson**: We're going to get some responses only until the beginning of August.
**Jdawson**: So I'll keep you posted on that.
**Jdawson**: Nothing new.
**Jdawson**: So I'll change this for August because we'll have that in August here.
**Jdawson**: Let's do the first, not July.
**Jdawson**: Maria Stavost, August 4th.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And I'll give you an, an update about that.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Goodwill, Tremond, Nick.
**Kmass**: That's I believe still with Brandon and Jared.
**Ataylor**: So Brandon or Jared said he would split the cost.
**Ataylor**: So I need you to revise that proposal showing half of the cost of the last one that was sent out.
**Ataylor**: Nick.
**Ataylor**: And then we just send that to Jared and we get our PO and we get started.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: We have next Uniqlo New Jersey.
**Jdawson**: This is Cuba.
**Jmendez**: Yes.
**Ataylor**: Back to.
**Ataylor**: Back to Tremont, Nick.
**Ataylor**: So we need to have.
**Ataylor**: We'll meet in the morning first thing and go through the scopes that we do.
**Ataylor**: We're going to have and we'll just confirm those with Jared to make sure he's got all those other things scoped out and bought.
**Ataylor**: And then we need to get a list of all the subs he's going to use because then we'll just run them and coordinate them like they were working for us anyways.
**Ataylor**: And we can get with Tara as well.
**Ataylor**: She since Andrew's gone or this new guy, we could find out if the new PM maybe is him and we'll just get in touch with him and start working with him on that.
**Jmendez**: Yes, we have the electrician, they are continuing to put up the feeders and the plumber started the floor demo this morning and they are 75% complete today and are finishing up tomorrow.
**Jmendez**: And then Wednesday they are coming into to install the vent pipes and they are going to begin the oil water separator installation and they are likely to finish that by the end of the week and then they'll give it a few days before they can pour back the concrete on top of the demoed areas.
**Jmendez**: This week we also getting ready for the rack delivery from Exotech.

**Jdawson**: memphis calls to rush phase two.
**Gducharme**: Oh, man.
**Gducharme**: I haven't heard anything since Wednesday, but me and Brandon were together Wednesday night and it sounds like the government pulled the funding.
**Gducharme**: So that one may not be a job anymore, but I do have some work I need to do.
**Gducharme**: I need to compile a bill for all of our work to date for design.
**Gducharme**: I believe I put a task in there for that.

**Fireflies**: We're going to get some pricing for that.
**Fireflies**: The lights are the custom orders.
**Fireflies**: They're not going to be in for a week late, but with the stuff that they added, we're gonna have our turnover day pushed out a week or two.
**Fireflies**: So we should still be able to finish on time even with the cabinets and counters being added.
**Ataylor**: That's it.
**Ataylor**: So the, you know, this last email from Jared, like, go through this, like, if there's anything you're unclear on, but it's the direction from Andrew in the email with those finishes and those limits.
**Ataylor**: Are you getting.

**Fireflies**: Yeah, I already sent it to.
**Fireflies**: I already sent what I need to them.

**Gducharme**: Nick Jepsen, you are.
**Ataylor**: Who else is doing what and who.
**Gducharme**: All is waiting for a response from Chris Lopez?
**Gducharme**: We give him too much work for him not to respond.
**Gducharme**: Right now there's two guys.
**Gducharme**: So Brandon will get in his ass, that's for sure.
**Njepson**: As I say, I'm the new guy.

**Gducharme**: No, he'll listen to.

**Gducharme**: As far as interior goes, we're totally complete.
**Gducharme**: We just have to get flooring done.
**Gducharme**: They just sent us their selection today.
**Gducharme**: That's in stock, so it's only three classrooms.
**Gducharme**: We'll probably have it knocked out by end of the week.
**Jdawson**: Thank you, aj.
**Jdawson**: Keva Radial.
**Jmendez**: Evan, Yvonne, we are moving along.
**Jmendez**: I need to write a change order for Tony for the.
**Jmendez**: The two dark doors.
**Jmendez**: Sorry, Doc.
**Jmendez**: Doc locks.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, Kevin, I wouldn't.
**Gducharme**: I know you got a lot going on, so just get it to him here when you can.
**Jmendez**: Yeah, he called me before this call, so did he send that to him?
**Gducharme**: Okay, well, they're still moving along right now.
**Gducharme**: We got our fencing pretty much done.
**Gducharme**: We're waiting on some guardrail from.
**Gducharme**: From Radial themselves to get delivered.
**Gducharme**: We had our ribbon cutting earlier today with Amazon and we're just pressing hard now on electrical and dock doors.
**Gducharme**: All the other little stuff is complete.
**Gducharme**: So they received the official go from Amazon, which is hilarious because we had already done about a million and a half worth of work.
**Jmendez**: AJ the pricing that Christian is sending you, what project is that for?
**Jmendez**: For the handrails.
**Gducharme**: That's for Coram Deo.
**Gducharme**: That's a different project.
**Jmendez**: Gotcha.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Thank you, AJ and.
**Jdawson**: Sorry, Kev.
**Jdawson**: 13.
**Jdawson**: 204.
**Jdawson**: Market demise, AJ.
**Gducharme**: Yep.
**Gducharme**: I'm just waiting on.
**Gducharme**: I'll ask accounting if they've paid us.
**Gducharme**: I'm pretty sure they have.
**Jdawson**: Okay, Nick.
**Jdawson**: Spire Cassimi.
**Kmass**: I just need to submit the final invoice.
**Jdawson**: Okay, perfect.
**Jdawson**: This is Radial Brownsburg.
**Jdawson**: This is AJ Plus Keva.
**Jmendez**: Yeah, this one's done.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, we're totally down there.
**Ataylor**: Should we ever get a po?
**Gducharme**: No, I've.
**Gducharme**: I have busted him up about it a couple times, so he'll get us one.
**Gducharme**: But we need to build because they want to.
**Ataylor**: Bill, speaking of billing, like, has everyone started to get subcontractor billings in?
**Ataylor**: Because those need to be done, finished by the end of this week.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, Jesse, I had a question on that.
**Gducharme**: So Job Planner makes you go in for each subcontract and create a bill and then invite them.
**Gducharme**: Is there no way to streamline that?
**Gducharme**: Like in procore where you click one button and they're all invited to bill?
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: Nick, you can explain that.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Kmass**: I haven't seen an option to do that either.
**Gducharme**: Well, we need to ask Job Planner, because that's like, I feel bad for Glenn and.
**Gducharme**: Or on these future projects, if you got to go in and ask 30 different subcontractors to.
**Gducharme**: To bill, you do.
**Fireflies**: And right.
**Fireflies**: Right now that you can only set one person to be the person who bills.
**Fireflies**: And I didn't know that.
**Fireflies**: So, like, at the beginning, I was the estimator, you know, whoever I wrote the contract with.
**Fireflies**: But then the accountant or the project manager, somebody's going to bill.
**Fireflies**: But you can't unset it.
**Fireflies**: Once the contract's approved, you can't make that change.
**Fireflies**: So always ask, hey, who's the person who's going to be invoicing this job?
**Kmass**: And put them in.
**Kmass**: They actually updated that, Glenn.
**Ataylor**: They did?
**Kmass**: Yeah, recently.
**Gducharme**: Because.
**Gducharme**: I know, because in procore yet, you have to put a specific invoice contact on there.
**Gducharme**: So that's not.
**Gducharme**: That's not too crazy.
**Gducharme**: But having to go through and invite like.
**Ataylor**: But have you looked at, though, if the billing period is open and, like, their permissions are set correctly, they don't need to be invited.
**Ataylor**: I don't think they can just go in and create an invoice for that billing period.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: That may Be wrong, but I'm pretty sure that's how it is.
**Ataylor**: Like, as long as they're.
**Ataylor**: But, like, the only problems I found.
**Ataylor**: I don't know, Nick, if we were working on it or what job was working on, but it was simply that they didn't have the right permissions to create an invoice.
**Kmass**: Yeah, yeah, you do have to update their permissions.
**Ataylor**: So once you do that, just tell them, hey, you know, you send out.
**Ataylor**: They.
**Ataylor**: You know, we should be able to send out notices.
**Ataylor**: If they don't have that set up.
**Ataylor**: We need to get it.
**Ataylor**: But just let all, you know, something that's sent out to all the subs, say, hey, your billings due by this date.
**Ataylor**: And then.
**Ataylor**: But I agree it should be one email.
**Ataylor**: Should be every sub.
**Gducharme**: And.
**Gducharme**: And I'm just bringing it up because I just sent my first invites to bill out on Job Planner.
**Gducharme**: I was like, this kind of sucks.
**Gducharme**: So.
**Gducharme**: Well, if we can get with Job Planner, that should be an easy feature.
**Ataylor**: What have you been doing the last four months?
**Gducharme**: I haven't been in Job Plan.
**Gducharme**: All my jobs are in procore.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: But anyway, what job are we on?
**Gducharme**: Brownsburg.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: You wanna.
**Jdawson**: We have the next one.
**Jdawson**: What Will.
**Jdawson**: Decatur, this is Glenn.
**Fireflies**: Decatur is done.
**Jdawson**: Decatur.
**Fireflies**: Yeah, indicator's done.
**Fireflies**: Alex has got to stop by and drop some air grills in tomorrow before.
**Ataylor**: He goes on vacation.
**Fireflies**: But we finished that this morning and sent the invoice.
**Fireflies**: I'm getting invoices from the last sub right now.
**Fireflies**: Waiting on one more invoice from them.
**Ataylor**: And we're done.
**Fireflies**: This one's done.
**Jdawson**: Thank you, Glenn.
**Jdawson**: And then we have Nick, the rubbling hops.
**Kmass**: Yeah, I submitted for permit today and the city called me.
**Kmass**: They want me to update the address on the letter from Duke.
**Kmass**: So I was in contact with them and they're going to be sending me an updated letter.
**Ataylor**: And is that the proposal is done now for that, Nick.
**Kmass**: I'm waiting to get the plumbing estimates, and Mike's gonna send me a number for installing the silk pants, and then I'll have everything.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Nick, these are not all your tasks.
**Jdawson**: Correct.
**Kmass**: I'm not sure what all those are for.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, no, this is not.
**Jdawson**: This is not you.
**Jdawson**: So we need to.
**Jdawson**: I'll go.
**Jdawson**: I'll fix this for you.
**Jdawson**: Because they are showing tasks.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: That are just for all them in there.
**Ataylor**: You've been just typing in this one for everyone's stuff because, like, AJ's in there.
**Gducharme**: I think.
**Gducharme**: I think what.
**Gducharme**: What's happening is when you create a new job, sometimes the Filter.
**Gducharme**: The way you see the filters up there, you need to filter.
**Gducharme**: Filter it.
**Gducharme**: So the only tasks showing are the tasks associated with the Roebling homes or whatever that project is.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: I just fix it for unique.
**Kmass**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So you have all your space here for you.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I know, A.J.
**Jdawson**: sometimes it's a little bit complicated, but anyway, so this is for you, and I'm just gonna leave you as a test.
**Jdawson**: Just for test.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: This is just you.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: You see how upset Nick got when he saw all those tasks that he had to do?
**Ataylor**: It's always just flying off the handle.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, man.
**Gducharme**: Take it easy, Nick.
**Jdawson**: Okay, perfect.
**Jdawson**: We have no estimating.
**Jmendez**: AJ we are getting delivery of the.
**Jmendez**: The dark seals for Avon on Wednesday.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: I think that may be pushed to Friday.
**Jmendez**: Oh, why?
**Gducharme**: Because Kurt maybe can't be there Wednesday too.
**Gducharme**: Unless they just called you.
**Gducharme**: And I just missed a call from Kurt, so that may be what he was calling me about.
**Jmendez**: I spoke with.
**Jmendez**: With Tony before I confirmed with Tom, so he said Wednesday is good for him and.
**Jmendez**: Okay, well, let me know if you find out so I can update time so they don't ship it on from on Wednesday.
**Gducharme**: If not, I'm officially.
**Gducharme**: I officially know how to drive a forklift, so.
**Gducharme**: Okay, I can offload them, and then they have to pay my rate, not Kurt's, and I'm expensive.
**Jmendez**: All right, we'll have an invoice sent to Tony.
**Jmendez**: Jesse, we need to make a final payment for that.
**Ataylor**: For what?
**Jmendez**: For the Daxios I think we used.
**Jmendez**: We paid half of it with your credit card, so we need to make that final payment.
**Ataylor**: Was that something accounting can cut you a check?
**Jmendez**: Okay, I'll reach out to them.
**Ataylor**: I mean, I'd rather not.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, you need to have the.
**Gducharme**: The Doc Seal company send us an invoice, and we're not paying it until we see them on site.
**Gducharme**: But have them send us an invoice and then we can submit it that way.
**Jmendez**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: Did credit card right, if I'm not mistaken.
**Gducharme**: Because we need to get them ordered quickly.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, it was a deposit to place the order.
**Ataylor**: So, like, now if it's due, you could get the check cut when they deliver them, hand it to them and say, here you go.
**Jmendez**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Moving to estimating projects, A.J.
**Jdawson**: stungate, orthodontist.
**Gducharme**: I spoke with Dr. Miller this morning, and unfortunately, the endo donis that they had lined up for the second tenant space that we're building backed out.
**Gducharme**: So they're working through the next couple weeks on getting him off the deed for the land.
**Gducharme**: But they really liked what we did with our layout, and so that project's moving forward.
**Gducharme**: They don't expect to be in until 2027.
**Gducharme**: So here in the fall, we'll start hopefully ramping up design and getting through all of our permitting so we can break ground in March.
**Jdawson**: Thank you.
**Jdawson**: AJ Mix Use KY Union.
**Jdawson**: This is Brandon.
**Jdawson**: Jesse.
**Jdawson**: Do we know anything about this?
**Ataylor**: I don't.

**Ataylor**: We got to get some drawings done is all.
**Ataylor**: I don't know if they got the survey done or not.
**Jdawson**: Thank you, Jesse.

**Jdawson**: Nothing else?
**Jdawson**: Jesse?
**Ataylor**: Yeah, sure.
**Ataylor**: There's other things we got to do, but that's all I can think of right now.
**Ataylor**: Jesse.
**Ataylor**: Jesse R. Did you get in your rental car yet?
**Ataylor**: Nope.
**Jdawson**: Jesse R. You're muted.
**Jdawson**: Is he.
**Ataylor**: I don't know.
**Ataylor**: He's.
**Ataylor**: He might be going through.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, something at the airport.
**Gducharme**: Okay, I'm gonna call him.
**Gducharme**: He better not try to make it to the office because he's gonna run into two hours worth of traffic there in 465.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, coming that way.
**Ataylor**: Where's.
**Ataylor**: Is there anyone in the office?
**Ataylor**: I guess Glenn.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, unless Brandon's there.
**Gducharme**: It's just Glenn right now.
**Gducharme**: Where's he staying?
**Gducharme**: Jesse, do you get.
**Gducharme**: You got a hotel?
**Gducharme**: Airbnb.
**Jdawson**: Airbnb.
**Jdawson**: I got him an Airbnb.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: A nice one.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, he's like, 10 minutes from the office, but it's a really good one.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Nick.
**Jdawson**: Novosbuild, Excel Center.
**Kmass**: Goodwill.
**Kmass**: They're trying to set up a meeting with the school administrator to review the layout.
**Ataylor**: So Andrew did send that plan to them.
**Ataylor**: I seen the email.
**Ataylor**: So I'm sure when Andrew gets back next week, we can get that meeting scheduled quick.
**Ataylor**: We really need to get them drawings going.
**Ataylor**: So.
**Jdawson**: Anything else?
**Jdawson**: Nick?
**Jdawson**: Should we add here?
**Kmass**: All that says no?
**Jdawson**: Thank you.
**Jdawson**: Aj.
**Jdawson**: Ulta Beauty.
**Jdawson**: Fresno.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Gducharme**: So I just created everything in Plan Hub, so we've.
**Gducharme**: I've sent that out, trying to get them pricing next Tuesday.
**Ataylor**: So is it in Fresno?
**Ataylor**: And, like, do you have all the.
**Ataylor**: What are all the details from.
**Ataylor**: I know Jesse was asking about that.
**Ataylor**: Unless you talk to him.
**Ataylor**: Do we know the size of the units and everything?
**Gducharme**: I mean, we don't know.
**Gducharme**: No, we.
**Gducharme**: We need a.
**Gducharme**: We needed a H VAC design builder.
**Gducharme**: I mean, getting them pricing.
**Gducharme**: We're Getting them a budget by next Tuesday.
**Gducharme**: But I have.
**Gducharme**: We got to figure out how many units we need to add.
**Gducharme**: We got to figure out.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, we got some stuff to figure out.
**Ataylor**: But what is his like, what did he give you to figure that out on?
**Ataylor**: Is it a description of it?
**Gducharme**: I. I have.
**Gducharme**: I have existing drawings.
**Ataylor**: Of the building and they're saying of their.
**Gducharme**: And so they need to achieve.
**Gducharme**: I believe it's 68 degrees on 100 degree day.
**Gducharme**: So.
**Ataylor**: In a storage facility.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: It'S going to cost a fortune.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, I mean I'm expecting us to have to add at least 10 units.
**Gducharme**: You know, 25 ton units.
**Gducharme**: So my first thought was to, you know, I haven't dug deep enough but to look at a 670,000 square foot warehouse and they only have 12 units.
**Gducharme**: So we're going to have to add.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, 10 to 10 to 15 units.
**Gducharme**: So electrical, structural.
**Gducharme**: And so we got to look at.
**Gducharme**: We're gonna look at the capacity of, of their electrical now and see if we have to add in a new service.
**Gducharme**: And so we gotta do some digging on it.
**Gducharme**: But Maria, why did you have to keep on plan?
**Ataylor**: Hub, why does makeup have to be kept so cold here?
**Jdawson**: Where I live is very cold.
**Jdawson**: Unfortunately, June and July is super cold.
**Ataylor**: I'm saying Ulta Beauty, they want it 68 degrees in that warehouse seems unreasonable.
**Jdawson**: You know what?
**Jdawson**: I'll take it.
**Jdawson**: A.J.
**Jdawson**: i'll go and I'll help you.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: All right.
**Jdawson**: But so on this note actually for the California license.
**Jdawson**: So Jesse.
**Jdawson**: So Lisa sent to bonds waiting on your response that I told you from Arizona.
**Jdawson**: They said that probably over the weekend can send us a verification license non license or the verification form reciprocity.
**Jdawson**: So waiting on that.
**Jdawson**: And once we have that, we can mail that.
**Jdawson**: And then once mail.
**Jdawson**: Well, they will send us an email with the application number and then we can just look that up online and then that's it.
**Jdawson**: But other than that, we have everything.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Just waiting on that paper from Arizona, which is the most important one because that gives us a lot of waivers for requirements.
**Jdawson**: So I'll keep you posted once we get a response.
**Jdawson**: Okay?
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Jesse.
**Jdawson**: Tampa OFFICE BUILDING no update okay, this is AJ Chart your auto repair.

**Jdawson**: Him.
**Ataylor**: And so this week, hopefully Wednesday, Thursday, we'll get the pricing and the options to them.
**Kmass**: We have pricing out to all the subs, but I imagine it might take a week to get actual numbers from them.
**Kmass**: So we would have to plug numbers if we want it this week.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, we will.
**Jdawson**: Perfect.
**Jdawson**: Thank you, Nick.
**Jdawson**: A.J.
**Jdawson**: vermion Rice Building Edition.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, I know.
**Gducharme**: Brandon was chatting with them a little bit Thursday about getting released on design.
**Gducharme**: I haven't heard anything other than that.
**Gducharme**: We were chatting a bit about going through the numbers.
**Jdawson**: Okay, thank you, AJ City Bird, this is aj.
**Gducharme**: Nothing yet.
**Gducharme**: I need to follow up with Wes.
**Gducharme**: He also still owes us payment, I think for that demise job.
**Gducharme**: So we'll see.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Jesse, 440 west in our building.
**Ataylor**: Alex helping out with that.
**Ataylor**: We'll have that in tomorrow morning.
**Jdawson**: Alec is helping with this one.
**Jdawson**: Yes, Alec.
**Jdawson**: Okay, perfect.
**Jdawson**: And this one?
**Jdawson**: Keva Radio Godiva, Martinsville.
**Jmendez**: Yes, I just put this on Plan Hut this morning.
**Jmendez**: Right now I have received numbers for demolition and framing.
**Jmendez**: I have one guy working on numbers for H Vac and one for electrical and another guy doing data.
**Jmendez**: I think right now I don't have numbers for painting and doors, but those should be easy to put in.
**Gducharme**: Evesh, send me an invite for tomorrow and we could start building the estimate.
**Jmendez**: Okay.
**Jmendez**: Yeah, I did start putting plug in some of the numbers that I've received in there.
**Jmendez**: What terms?
**Gducharme**: I don't know, just probably Afternoon.
**Jmendez**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: Are we getting multiple numbers for each trade or right now you just.
**Gducharme**: How's our coverage looking?
**Jmendez**: I have one for each.
**Jmendez**: Except for electrical.
**Jmendez**: That is another guy that just reached out.
**Jmendez**: So we'll see.
**Gducharme**: Let's try and get at least.
**Gducharme**: At least two framing numbers because that's the bulk of the cost is building that demising wall.
**Jmendez**: Yeah.
**Jmendez**: Okay.
**Jmendez**: Yeah.
**Jmendez**: I may start reaching out for companies outside of PlanHub.
**Gducharme**: And have you had any contact with the engineer on site for us, but.
**Jmendez**: Say that again.
**Gducharme**: When did we commit to getting them a price?
**Gducharme**: When did we commit to getting them a price?
**Gducharme**: Or have we at all?
**Gducharme**: I'm not sure if you've talked to that engineer you met at all.
**Jmendez**: Yes, I did.
**Jmendez**: At all.
**Jmendez**: We'll get them final pricing by Friday.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: Try to try to include me or Jesse Dawson or someone on those correspondence.
**Gducharme**: So we're in the loop.
**Gducharme**: All right.
**Jmendez**: Yes, I think you should be on all the emails that I sent.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Any other projects to add on the estimate as current projects?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, go ahead.
**Gducharme**: You need to add one on there, Maria.
**Gducharme**: Just.
**Jdawson**: Estimate.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Gducharme**: On the estimating is just the Vargo.
**Gducharme**: Vargo permitting.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: Were you able to do any digging on reciprocity for Las Vegas?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, they have reciprocity, so with Arizona.
**Jdawson**: So we can have the same.
**Jdawson**: We have the.
**Jdawson**: We just need the same thing.
**Jdawson**: So we need the verification form as reciprocity, and then we need to have the bond experience.
**Jdawson**: And there is a test that probably, if Jesse's applying or you, I don't know, might have to take.
**Jdawson**: That's it.
**Gducharme**: What's the test?
**Ataylor**: Are they.
**Ataylor**: Are they willing to pay us for those?
**Ataylor**: Would they say.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, I. I owe him a price.
**Gducharme**: I thought we need to get together and send them something.
**Gducharme**: I'm gonna.
**Gducharme**: I'm gonna.
**Gducharme**: I mean, Fort Worth is going to be easy, easy peasy.
**Gducharme**: But, you know, timeline wise, they want to be able to start on 9.
**Gducharme**: 9.
**Gducharme**: And so we get.
**Gducharme**: We.
**Gducharme**: We need to decide this week, basically.
**Ataylor**: No, but did you tell them, hey, this could cost $40,000 for us to get a license there?
**Ataylor**: Did they say, oh, hell no.
**Gducharme**: I told him 20, 25.
**Gducharme**: Talking with Brandon about it, but, like, I haven't committed to anything.
**Gducharme**: But I need to give him an answer here soon.
**Gducharme**: So I had Maria look into how if it's as easy.
**Gducharme**: It's just.
**Gducharme**: I'm not going to say it's easy, Jesse.
**Ataylor**: It's not.
**Ataylor**: Well, I mean, like, we've been waiting.
**Ataylor**: I emailed Arizona, what, two weeks ago, Three weeks ago, just my license in Arizona, which is.
**Ataylor**: I would hope they got computers there and these numbers are plugged in there and they're like, told Maria today.
**Ataylor**: Hopefully they'll get it sent back at the end of this week.
**Gducharme**: Yes, we just.
**Gducharme**: I'll talk with Brandon about it.
**Gducharme**: We just need to know how easy is it from Arizona to Nevada?
**Gducharme**: If it's fairly easy and we can do it quickly, then I don't see what's the issue with making, you know, some money.
**Gducharme**: But if it's.
**Gducharme**: You got to go take a test and all that, Jesse, then how much.
**Ataylor**: Are those bonds costing us?
**Ataylor**: Is that that much?
**Ataylor**: Maria?
**Jdawson**: The bonds is like 2,500 for one.
**Jdawson**: I have.
**Jdawson**: I think I share with you guys.
**Jdawson**: Let me check right now.
**Jdawson**: I think I have everything here.
**Jdawson**: I think it's.
**Jdawson**: One second.
**Jdawson**: This is Las Vegas requirements right here.
**Jdawson**: One second.
**Jdawson**: From Nevada, I have.
**Jdawson**: Here.
**Jdawson**: Let me check something really quick.
**Jdawson**: The bond is.
**Jdawson**: I don't want to Collapse it.
**Jdawson**: I want to open it.
**Jdawson**: The bond is.
**Jdawson**: Or sometimes it's like 5,000.
**Jdawson**: I'll share with you.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: So it says here section A.
**Jdawson**: So this is the examination requirements.
**Jdawson**: Nevada qualified.
**Jdawson**: It has to be the laws and the license laws and business one.
**Jdawson**: And the bond is.
**Jdawson**: I can't find it.
**Jdawson**: There's a lot of things here.
**Jdawson**: I think it's between 2000 something and 5000 usually, but I'll have to confirm.
**Jdawson**: But everything is in the application here.
**Ataylor**: You send them a thousand Caesar palace chips.
**Ataylor**: That's their bond.
**Gducharme**: Well, let's just put it on our radar to talk about tomorrow.
**Gducharme**: Jesse, I'll give Brandon to call and see how serious he is about it.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: And then the 940 Mar road that needs to be added.
**Jdawson**: That's a new one.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: What's the name again, Jesse?
**Ataylor**: Or is it Columbus Christian Academy?
**Gducharme**: Yeah, I would put.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, that was my next one.
**Gducharme**: I was gonna say is Columbus.
**Gducharme**: Columbus Christian.
**Jdawson**: The date of as of today as well.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, that's fine.
**Gducharme**: But I mean we're not going to have anything until in the.
**Gducharme**: Until, you know, a month from now.
**Jdawson**: And this is what state?
**Gducharme**: Columbus, Indiana.
**Jdawson**: Indian.
**Ataylor**: Nick.
**Ataylor**: They want to build out the rest of that BART school.
**Kmass**: Nice.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Any other projects to add, estimating current ones?
**Jdawson**: Nope.
**Jdawson**: So your final words?
**Jdawson**: No.
**Jdawson**: Anything else?
**Jdawson**: Sure.

**Jdawson**: And then.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that's it.
**Jdawson**: Thanks for your time, guys.
**Ataylor**: All right, excellent.
**Ataylor**: We'll see you.
**Jdawson**: Bye, guys.
**Ataylor**: Thanks, Maria.
**Ataylor**: Bye.
