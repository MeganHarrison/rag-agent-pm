## Transcript
**Aelkarrimy**: Kevin, looks like we're still waiting on at least Ahmed and Yasuka.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, Yuzuka is not going to be here.
**Bclymer**: He's on.
**Bclymer**: He's on vacation.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Kevin.ly**: I'll bet you'll be on in like two minutes.
**Mparsons**: Okay, sounds good, thanks.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So do we know who's the designated person from Uniqlo that's gonna make the decision on which direction to go with this change order if Yuzuk is out?
**Bryan.wagar**: Thank you so much.
**Bryan.wagar**: Oh, no, me.
**Bryan.wagar**: I will not make the executive decision today.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Do we know when Ahmed do.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I was saying, do we know.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Since the UK is out, do we know who from the UNICO team?
**Bryan.wagar**: And we have, I believe, Mina sun was supposed to join.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I mean, regardless, we have to move forward with it now.
**Bclymer**: How?
**Bclymer**: It's going to be split up by Exotech absorbing some of the costs and Uniqlo paying for some of it.
**Bclymer**: We're not going to sort that out on this call.
**Bclymer**: But yes, we do need to move forward with this or else we can't install it.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Do we know which option we want to do?
**Bclymer**: We want to do the one that doesn't change the schedule.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay, all right, so then what we'll do is we'll amend that change order and send out a revision.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Basically that will take out the general, the 36,000 and general conditions, add back in the 44 for the OT, and then it'll, you know, keep the schedule as is.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And yeah, we'll send that back out for execution.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So as far as the.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: As far as the, you know, what you mentioned, Joe?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: As far as the.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Who pays for what?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: As far as, like, you know, I understand, like, you know, Exotech or Uniqlo, whatever you guys work at on the back end is fine because this change is part of a complete fire sprinkler system.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: This change has to be executed and signed by Uniqlo and Uniqlo has to pay us for this work.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: We can't split out, you know, just a little portion of this system and do two separate things like that is there.
**Bclymer**: So how does that work on the electric then?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: It's not the same system.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So what?
**Bclymer**: You like the same system?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay, Right.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So remember, like, you know, a fire, like a circuit for electrical is its own thing, right?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Versus a sprinkler system.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Like these 14 lines affect the rest of the system.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So it's a lot easier on different components.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Right?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Because we can clearly call like a line of delineation saying like, hey, you know, this circuit belongs to whatever versus this.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: You can't like one screw up on this, fucks up the rest of the thing.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Well, it's a.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: It's a cleaner warranty is essentially what it is.
**Mparsons**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I got a couple topics to run through today, but Keva, if you can, I want to let Kevin do his thing and then we can go through each of these topics.
**Bclymer**: Because I do want to talk about sprinkler, I do want to talk about electric, and then I do want to talk about one other, one or two other items as well.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Are any of those things that you need answers from me on?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: The only reason I ask is I'm at a conference.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I stepped out.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So whatever needs to happen with me, jump into that.
**Bclymer**: Well, then let's talk about the sprinkler to start, if we can.
**Bclymer**: The change order Uikita mine.
**Bclymer**: I don't know if mine is on here.
**Bclymer**: Yo, Ikeda, do you have questions regarding Armine?
**Bclymer**: Do you have any questions regarding the actual check exchange order and pricing here of what Brandon just said?
**Bryan.wagar**: Nina's son and Yukita, you guys are both on mute if you guys are speaking.
**Kevin.ly**: So, Joel, sorry, what's your question?
**Bclymer**: So what Brandon said is with this, with this quote that we had that was sent out to Everybody, it says 184 is the total.
**Bclymer**: So that 184 is a total with a five week delay.
**Bclymer**: In order to keep the schedule, we have to pay an additional $44,000 as it says right there as alternate.
**Bclymer**: But paying that 44 also takes out that GC fee that's up at the top.
**Bclymer**: So we're looking at around $192,000.
**Bclymer**: What Brandon was saying earlier is that that has to, that has to be put towards the bill to Uniqlo.
**Bclymer**: He can't price it out.
**Bclymer**: Even if we discuss that it's going to be divvied out or we're going to discuss, but divvy it out in a different way.
**Bclymer**: Exotect is going to have to find a different way to, to get you that money back.
**Bclymer**: But this has to be paid by Uniqlo and because it's part of the whole Sprinkler pack is what he was saying.
**Bclymer**: And we uni or Exotech will have to find a different way to get you that cost savings back, whether it be just paying you or I don't know how else.
**Bclymer**: But whatever we decide.
**Bclymer**: But moving forward, in order to get this change order moving, Uniqlo will have to sign off on it.
**Bclymer**: And if you want me to write in an email so we have it.
**Bclymer**: Or I will definitely write in an email so that we have it.
**Bclymer**: Hey, Uniqlo will have to pay for this 184 towards this sprinkler change.
**Bclymer**: But this will be part of the negotiation we with the conversation we had the other week once we find the cost of the rack change as well.
**Kevin.ly**: So like actually if like a 184k will be charged, so we have no choice but like.
**Kevin.ly**: Okay, so this is like a discussion point between like exotech and the unique role.
**Kevin.ly**: So how we can correct it?
**Bclymer**: Correct.
**Bclymer**: I'm just saying that you, you have to pay for it and then we'll.
**Bclymer**: Exotech will have to find a way to reimburse you because Aliato can't like just like the electric heat.
**Bclymer**: They can charge us directly with this because it's part of the whole sprinkler system.
**Bclymer**: They can't break that cost out.
**Kevin.ly**: Okay, okay, Understood, Understood.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: But it's not going to be 184, it's going to be 192.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: We'll get it adjusted so it's correct.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: But it's right there.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: It's going to be at ballpark.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Kevin.ly**: Not it.
**Bclymer**: Okay, sorry.
**Bschwartz**: One question.
**Jdawson**: Confirmation.
**Jdawson**: This one 84 is including additional 44.
**Bclymer**: No, no.
**Bryan.wagar**: So, so Yukita, what happens here?
**Bryan.wagar**: The add alternate.
**Bryan.wagar**: The 44 is not included in this change order.
**Bryan.wagar**: Right now, right now you're paying $36,738 for a delay in the schedule.
**Bryan.wagar**: But if you pay for the expedited schedule, we take out the 36,000 and we put the 44 and all you're paying is a net between the two is $8,000.
**Bryan.wagar**: So it would be 184 plus $8,000 basically.
**Bryan.wagar**: But this way you stick to the same end date and at the same time you're avoiding general conditions.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, it's like a win win.
**Bryan.wagar**: By paying the expedited schedule this way you're only paying an eight thousand dollar difference.
**Bryan.wagar**: So it'll come up to 192.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, it'll be 1 184, 202 minus the 36, 738.
**Bryan.wagar**: And then you add the 44 on top and that will be your change.
**Aelkarrimy**: It'll.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: It'll be, it won't be a direct because you're going to have the markup that calculates off the subtotal.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: But yes, it's going to be 192, 193 and.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Or something like that and change.
**Bclymer**: Cool.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Then we, we'll get that amended and sent out for the Unicode team for execution.
**Bryan.wagar**: So, Joe and Uniqlo team, if you guys can, once you receive this revised change order, the sooner we receive an email just that says go ahead, then we know that it's approved, and then you guys can sort out the logistics of who's paying what in the.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: On the sidelines.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: And I will send that in writing to you mine once this new one comes in.
**Bclymer**: Since we're talking about sprinkler Henderson, is there.
**Bclymer**: Is there a revised drawing that we should be looking out for or Aliata should be looking out for.
**Bschwartz**: For those sprinkler updates?
**Bschwartz**: Yes, I sent out a revised drawing either late last week or early this week with the elevation view included to aid in pricing.
**Bschwartz**: And then we'll need to coordinate with TPG on timing of the Bulletin 1 issuance, which will incorporate all of the changes for fire sprinkler that have been discussed recently.
**Bclymer**: And per your email, we don't have to change any of the other piping that's being installed right now?
**Bschwartz**: That.
**Bschwartz**: That's correct.
**Bschwartz**: We.
**Bschwartz**: Cheryl, ran the hydraulic calcs, and it actually improved our.
**Bschwartz**: Our hydraulic calculation through the system.
**Bclymer**: Oh, that's good news.
**Bschwartz**: Not enough to decrease the pipe size.
**Bschwartz**: I'll clarify that now.
**Bschwartz**: But we confirmed that the pipe sizes do not need to increase.
**Bclymer**: Awesome.
**Bclymer**: The last thing, and that's kind of why I brought up the design, is I wanted to make sure that we talk in detail about that sandwich pipe that goes in between the two different rack heights.
**Bclymer**: I just want to make sure that that's designed in a way that's okay by Aliato about the flu space.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: That one might be a little tricky.
**Bclymer**: I don't know.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah, I mean, we definitely have to, you know, look at it and see how that is, you know, with your team.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: You know, one thing too, looking at.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I was going through, you know, as I was looking through some of this, I was going through the drawings, the sprinkler drawings.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And right now, that aerial view that you have basically just, you know, shows, you know, all the lines essentially are the same.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Right.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: However, what, you know, my understanding of 8:34 is, you know, because we go, you know, every four feet, so we're simply skipping a row all the way down.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So that would be the first row.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: The second level should be opposite of the first level, and then the third level would be opposite of the second.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So 1 and 3 should be the same layout, and then 2 and 4 should be the same layout.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Are you.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Are you guys tracking on that?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Because that's that's not what the drawings reflect unless I'm reading them incorrectly.
**Bschwartz**: You're talking about the head placements, Correct?
**Bschwartz**: I don't have anyone fire on, but based on my knowledge of A34 and the requirements from Exatec, the each level should be the same.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay, then that's, I mean if that's, if that's what we want to stick with, that's what we'll fabricate and put in.
**Bschwartz**: Let's see before, before we go down that path.
**Bschwartz**: Are you talking about the flu space heads or the.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I'm talking about.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So if you zoom in on that, that second, you know, section right there.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah, right there.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So see how right there we go like on the outside, on the front face, you have to have a head.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And then we're doing a separate head, you know, and then we skip a space then ahead, skip a space ahead, skip a space ahead.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: These are the out to outside ones.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So this is level one, Right.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: The second level, essentially where there's that space between those heads, that two foot space.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: There should be a head on that second level.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And then it would, it would reverse.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So it's basically creating a checkered pattern, you know, not the same all the way up on those outside aisles.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And it would be the exact same for that two, you know, up above the little double there, that would be, you know that this would be flipped on the second level.
**Bschwartz**: Yeah.
**Bschwartz**: Looking at this, the only way, only locations we would be able to do that alternate pattern would be at the top of the system or I guess at the north end of the system where it's this double rack and at the far south end of the system.
**Bschwartz**: Let me, let me ping Luther and Cheryl on that and, and make sure that what I said about it being the same layout for every level is correct.
**Bschwartz**: But I believe that is that, that's what we're showing currently is every, every level being the same.
**Bclymer**: And are you, are you, are we only worried about the outside racks or does this have anything to do with the.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: No.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So the, the, the, the flu space ones are all identical throughout.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: That's why we have to have the shielding above it.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: But these other ones again, in my, every system that I've done in the way I interpret the code is that those should be opposite every level so that they're, you know, spreading basically checker pattern coverage all the way up.
**Bschwartz**: Brian, I'll follow up with Luther.
**Bschwartz**: He's in a meeting right now.
**Bschwartz**: So if he frees up, I might pull him in and we can Circle back on that.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: But yeah, and again, I mean I. I've been wrong before.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: You know, it happened once in 08.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Tough time.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: But I just.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Last thing I want to do is install this and then, you know, you guys got to pay me $2 million to rip it out and do it again.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So I just want to make sure we're, you know, correct on this.
**Bschwartz**: Yeah, I'll get you an answer here either ASAP or buy in today.
**Jdawson**: Cool.
**Mparsons**: All right, Joe, what's the next topic you wanted to cover?
**Bclymer**: Well, I don't think I need Brandon for anything else other than the sprinkler conversation.
**Bclymer**: I'll let him get back to his conference if anybody make you guys feel special.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Joe, you said, you know.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: All right.
**Jdawson**: Anybody.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Anybody else need anything for me?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: All right.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Hearing none.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Thanks everybody.
**Bclymer**: Thanks for jumping on.
**Bclymer**: Thank you.
**Bclymer**: All right, I'll let you.
**Bclymer**: You can start from the beginning and do your updates again.
**Mparsons**: Mike, you want to pick up from here?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So on site.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Aelkarrimy**: So on site.
**Aelkarrimy**: The electrical team has been continuing their feeder runs.
**Aelkarrimy**: In addition to making connections to the main distribution system in the power room, they also received their transformers on site.
**Aelkarrimy**: And we also then we had our fire sprinkler team mobilized this week and they've begun hanging the four inch main pipe.
**Aelkarrimy**: So they're making progress there.
**Aelkarrimy**: And then we had our plumbing crew in this week to complete their trench pour back and then we had our plumbing inspection with the township pass.
**Aelkarrimy**: That's what I got right now for on site if there's no questions.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: So for the project schedule like Mike mentioned, we the electrician is continuing their feeder to transformer connections and the fire sprinkler main install began this week.
**Mparsons**: And we are for upcoming events we have the installation of the codes to the workstations for the electricians and then exotech is going to start their racking install.
**Mparsons**: We have them scheduled for the 25th to start.
**Bryan.wagar**: Are the slab markings complete?
**Mparsons**: Joe, I think.
**Aelkarrimy**: Joe.
**Aelkarrimy**: Sorry.
**Aelkarrimy**: Joe, is that your robots like he's referring to?
**Bclymer**: I'm sorry.
**Bclymer**: Say that.
**Bclymer**: Say that one more time.
**Bryan.wagar**: Did the robots complete the slab markings?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: No.
**Bclymer**: The robots start on Monday.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Bryan.wagar**: Do you have an idea of like what.
**Bryan.wagar**: What's the timeline on that?
**Bryan.wagar**: Just because I know Yusuke wants us on site.
**Bclymer**: Once those markings are complete, three to four weeks.
**Bryan.wagar**: Three to four weeks from that day.
**Jdawson**: Got it.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Bryan.wagar**: Oh nice.
**Bclymer**: He'll be out Monday.
**Bclymer**: He'll get everything set up.
**Bclymer**: I hope within the next day that that the robots start running.
**Bclymer**: But they generally overnight so I don't know if you want to be there while it's happening, but.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: No, no, no.
**Bryan.wagar**: You can start.
**Bclymer**: Come out.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, you can certainly come out during the day and see all the bright orange markings on the floor.
**Mparsons**: And Joe, are you guys doing Skypod B and A or just.
**Mparsons**: Just B for now?
**Bclymer**: He's.
**Bclymer**: He's gonna follow the install schedule.
**Bclymer**: So the robots.
**Bclymer**: The robots will follow doing all of B first and.
**Bclymer**: And then go to A this way, because we will start standing up racking by the time it's complete.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: So would you guys.
**Mparsons**: Do you think within the first week, you guys will be able to complete skyfab that way you are ready for racking installed on the 25th?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, it will be ready for the 25th.
**Bclymer**: Will Sky.
**Bclymer**: All of Skypod B be complete?
**Bclymer**: Probably not, but it'll be enough to start.
**Mparsons**: Gotcha.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bryan.wagar**: I'm assuming it's starting in zone one and two from that markup, and that should be the first thing that's completed from the robot.
**Bryan.wagar**: And then the racking starts on 8, 25.
**Bryan.wagar**: And then the robot continues the rest of Skypot B, Right?
**Jdawson**: Correct.
**Jdawson**: Correct.
**Jdawson**: Gotcha.
**Mparsons**: All right, moving on to.
**Kevin.ly**: Sorry, Sorry.
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah, Go back to, like, a sprinkler topic 192k.
**Kevin.ly**: Is it possible to provide like, a breakdown of the, like, a cost, like 192k, much more detail, because we have to, like, explain to the, like, our purchase committee on this additional cost so that, like, much more detailed is better for us to explain the college community.
**Bryan.wagar**: So basically, like, you need to show.
**Bryan.wagar**: You're showing 972 heads.
**Bryan.wagar**: We have a credit of 200 heads.
**Bryan.wagar**: How much are each head, for example, and how that leads to the material costs.
**Bryan.wagar**: Like, they need to see the math and how it's mathing.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: So they need a breakdown for that and the GC cost.
**Bryan.wagar**: Keep the GC.
**Bryan.wagar**: Like, you're obviously going to remove the GC cost because now we're moving the 44,000 in there.
**Bryan.wagar**: Right.
**Bryan.wagar**: So we're going to show that the.
**Bryan.wagar**: The overtime is 44,000.
**Bryan.wagar**: Labor is 87,000.
**Bryan.wagar**: How many man hours is the 87,800?
**Bryan.wagar**: And then materials, 40,851.
**Bryan.wagar**: What are the unit costs and what are we buying?
**Bryan.wagar**: Just so then they have an idea because they have to take it to their cfo, and then their CFO basically lets them say okay or no.
**Mparsons**: Okay, we'll make the changes.
**Jdawson**: Thank you.
**Kevin.ly**: Is that enough?
**Cheryl.green**: Yes, that's gonna be enough.
**Cheryl.green**: I just want to make sure we get it approved.
**Cheryl.green**: As quickly as possible so that backup makes it so they don't have any other questions they can ask.
**Mparsons**: All right, so for the open change orders, the two change orders, the two options we sent out for the transformers, now that we have a direction, we are going to void those two.
**Mparsons**: And then we will be sending out a new change order that covers every all of the changes that are happening with the electrical and we will send that back along with the credit change order.
**Mparsons**: And so right now we are working on pricing that with the electrician.
**Mparsons**: And for the other change orders that we are waiting for approval on is the permit fee change order.
**Mparsons**: We still don't have approval on that.
**Mparsons**: And also the insurance change order that we sent at the end of last month.
**Bryan.wagar**: I'm sorry, go ahead, Kevin.
**Mparsons**: Yeah, and that this change order that we sent out today and we'll be making changes to that to send back that would need approval on.
**Bryan.wagar**: Kevin, for the transformers one, when you guys void these two and we supply the new one, can we make sure that we call out the transformers and the switches and if any cable.
**Bryan.wagar**: Let's just call it electrical change order because there's more than just transformers included.
**Mparsons**: Correct.
**Bryan.wagar**: And then in your breakdown, when you do send it back to everyone, just make sure you call out again.
**Bryan.wagar**: The unit costs, everything like the labor requirements, everything broken out.
**Bryan.wagar**: This way Kevin can just get that passed through and then it comes back to us with an approved.
**Bclymer**: Well with the electric, the electrical will be paid by exit.
**Bryan.wagar**: Oh, I'm so sorry.
**Bclymer**: Yes, yes, that one said Brandon.
**Bclymer**: Brandon said he was able.
**Bclymer**: That one's able to be broken out and billed directly to us.
**Bclymer**: That that is perfectly fine.
**Bclymer**: And I guess, I mean that leads me into my next question.
**Bclymer**: I'm going to steal the screen for a second keba.
**Bclymer**: But Brian.
**Bclymer**: So this was the original when we were breaking everything down to 480.
**Bclymer**: This was the original basically.
**Bclymer**: Description or scope of work.
**Bclymer**: What does this change based on the new power dimms?
**Bschwartz**: This.
**Bschwartz**: You're saying this was.
**Bschwartz**: This was back when we first started on this electrical.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Bschwartz**: Change discussion.
**Bschwartz**: Trying to remember where these numbers came from.
**Bschwartz**: Specifically the 325amp breakers.
**Bschwartz**: But based on the analysis I put together earlier this week, those 125s aren't needed anymore.
**Bschwartz**: We actually need two 150s and I think that would.
**Bschwartz**: That was it for new circuit breakers needed.
**Bschwartz**: And then your, your wire sizes will probably go up a little bit too for those 150amp feeders.
**Bschwartz**: So probably a bit of additional cost there too.
**Bschwartz**: Does that answer your Question.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I was just curious because when we talked about it the other week, you made it.
**Bclymer**: You kind of made it sound like we might be able to lower some things, but from what you just said, it might be going up a little bit.
**Bschwartz**: I think.
**Bschwartz**: I think at the, you know, in total, it'll probably be lower because if this was 325amp breakers and 1100ft for three feeders, now we're looking at 250amp breakers and probably less linear footage of wire, but more a larger wire size.
**Bschwartz**: So it may end up being a wash. Maybe a little bit less.
**Bschwartz**: It may be a little bit more.
**Bclymer**: All right, Kevin, let me know as soon as that comes in so we can get that ordered and figure out where it fits in the schedule.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: Kevin.
**Cheryl.green**: For the two other change orders for the permit, one approval, I missed this one.
**Cheryl.green**: For the insurance change order.
**Cheryl.green**: I sent a message earlier today to Brandon about it when I got back from my insurance team.
**Cheryl.green**: The insurance coverage we need is different from what the change order is listing, so this will have to be revised.
**Mparsons**: Gotcha.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: You said you send the email to Brandon?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: All right, I'll talk to him and see what needs to change.
**Bryan.wagar**: And then, Kevin, for the permit, we just had an allowance of like, I believe 10k on the bids.
**Bryan.wagar**: So this was just a little bit over the 10k.
**Bryan.wagar**: So that's the change order that they're looking for.
**Cheryl.green**: Yeah, I remember.
**Mparsons**: Okay, so that's it on the change order.
**Mparsons**: So for the open RFIs, we did receive an email from.
**Mparsons**: From Ted, basically telling us the description of the floor.
**Mparsons**: I don't know, Ahmed, if there's a specification somewhere that we can.
**Mparsons**: Where did you get or.
**Bryan.wagar**: I do not, actually, because this is not.
**Bryan.wagar**: We have not.
**Bryan.wagar**: We didn't build the building, so we really don't know.
**Bryan.wagar**: And we have to lean on Uniqlo and fast retail.
**Bryan.wagar**: Here I see in your notes it says awaiting specification from ownership.
**Bryan.wagar**: Is Ted gathering something for you?
**Mparsons**: Well, he basically went to.
**Mparsons**: Went into the space to take a look at what is there, and he basically sent us a description.
**Mparsons**: Gray floor.
**Bryan.wagar**: And I know I could have said that to you too.
**Bryan.wagar**: Colors is my thing, so I could have done that.
**Bryan.wagar**: What I think we need to do is to make.
**Bryan.wagar**: Make sure that we loop and Ted and ask him for the build.
**Bryan.wagar**: The shell buildings finishes this way we can.
**Bryan.wagar**: And the restroom finishes.
**Bryan.wagar**: They need to give us that information in order for you guys to be able to price out matching those materials or if they want you to go through the exercise to provide Samples for review and approval and you can show them side by side existing versus this new spec and how it's going to make it look almost match.
**Bryan.wagar**: That could be one option versus the other.
**Bryan.wagar**: So I think what we'll do is I'll send an email on my end.
**Bryan.wagar**: But Mike, since you guys are on site, if you can stay on top of Ted after this one, I think he'll be able to pull something for us.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah, I'll talk to him tomorrow and.
**Bryan.wagar**: I'll do it on my end with digging through the as built that I have in my folder at least.
**Jdawson**: Finishes.
**Bclymer**: Stream and concourse.
**Mparsons**: All right.
**Mparsons**: Does anyone have anything else to add?
**Mparsons**: Any questions?
**Jdawson**: I think we're good on TPG's end.
**Mparsons**: Joe, anything on your end, Brian?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, there's a couple things I do want to.
**Bclymer**: This is a question actually for Mike and the Uniglo team because the uprights normally come from overseas.
**Bclymer**: They usually come in containers to where we use a dock door and you use straps and you pull them out of the container.
**Bclymer**: Well, we are sourcing these locally, actually.
**Bclymer**: I think it's coming from Tennessee and they come on a flatbed.
**Bclymer**: The issue is getting a flatbed, everything off of a flatbed and then into the facility.
**Bclymer**: The facility through dock doors is all but impossible unless you just do it by hand.
**Bclymer**: Basically a few at a time, which would take absolutely forever.
**Bclymer**: I wanted to see if it is possible that we can have a dock door to where we can rent a ramp and this way we can pull the vehicle directly into the facility and unload from there.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah, for sure we'll be able to designate one door for that.
**Aelkarrimy**: I'll go ahead and get measurements of exactly how big that dock door is.
**Aelkarrimy**: So there's not a surprise when, you know, the truck can't fit.
**Jdawson**: So but I'll.
**Aelkarrimy**: I'll send that over tomorrow.
**Aelkarrimy**: But yeah, as far as far as, you know, designating one door for that, that won't be a problem.
**Bclymer**: And then I've also instructed my team to know that at some point.
**Bclymer**: I don't know what's going on my computer right now.
**Bclymer**: At some point we will have to move that door to the south side.
**Bclymer**: But here are some pictures of.
**Bclymer**: Actually, give me a second.
**Jdawson**: I don't like that picture.
**Bclymer**: Just to give you an idea of what we are trying to rent is this.
**Bryan.wagar**: Joe, did you get approval that we can drive a vehicle in all.
**Bclymer**: That's why I wanted to ask Uniqlo as well, since we have Kevin and.
**Mparsons**: Ever the coolest hell.
**Bschwartz**: Wow.
**Bryan.wagar**: I'VE never seen this before.
**Bryan.wagar**: This is really cool.
**Jdawson**: They.
**Bryan.wagar**: They let you, they rent these things out?
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: So this one says £20,000, but the one we're renting will be 70,000.
**Bryan.wagar**: And how big, how big is the truck that's backing in or going in?
**Bclymer**: It's going to be a flatbed.
**Bclymer**: I mean, it's probably going to be about almost the size of a regular.
**Bclymer**: Regular truck.
**Bryan.wagar**: Well, that kind of just shoots a down right away because you're not taking into account the wheels and then the dock door.
**Bryan.wagar**: Look at the ceiling versus where that container stops as it relates to where the wheels are on the street.
**Bclymer**: Correct.
**Bclymer**: So it's not, it's not as high because the flatbed doesn't have the sides and roof.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yukita and Mina sun, is there, is there any objections with backing a truck into the space just so then they can get the shipments out?
**Kevin.ly**: I don't think so, but I. Joe, can you send an email to Ted?
**Bclymer**: It's like something like that.
**Bryan.wagar**: Oh, nice.
**Bryan.wagar**: So it doesn't even have a container.
**Jdawson**: Got it.
**Jdawson**: Correct.
**Kevin.ly**: Joe, can you send the email to Ted like our operation warehouse, Operation manager?
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Kevin.ly**: To double confirm.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah, yeah, Joe.
**Aelkarrimy**: And I'll.
**Aelkarrimy**: I'll talk to him about that tomorrow too.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, Mike, run it by him.
**Bclymer**: And if he needs a little more information on what we're doing, I'll send, I'll send them all this stuff.
**Bclymer**: I think these are called.
**Bclymer**: This is from Nation.
**Bclymer**: Nation something.
**Bclymer**: I'll get the actual name.
**Bclymer**: This was actually.
**Bclymer**: This was actually a recommendation strictly from the company that's manufacturing to say if you are going to rent a dock ramp, we suggest that you use Nation ramps because I guess they've used them in the past.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that's pretty cool.
**Bclymer**: And then this can be obviously like right here, you can pick it up with a forklift and then we can bring it around to the other side when it, when that time comes.
**Bclymer**: There's one other thing I had to talk about.
**Bryan.wagar**: Mike.
**Bryan.wagar**: When you guys sawed out for the, for the plumbing, the slab was on grade, right?
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Bryan.wagar**: Was there rebar in the, in the slab at all?
**Aelkarrimy**: I know we put rebar back in.
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay, just.
**Bryan.wagar**: Joe, when you do, when you do send this email to Ted.
**Bryan.wagar**: You know, usually when we have trucks or like any sort of machines driving on, in, on a, in a space we usually like, the structural engineer chimes in and lets us know if it's acceptable or not.
**Bryan.wagar**: So I just, I'm not sure if Ted has that information where he can tell you yes.
**Bryan.wagar**: We can have a truck with X amount of weight coming into the.
**Bryan.wagar**: Into the space, unless it's stopping right at the door.
**Bryan.wagar**: I'm not sure how this is going to work, but I'm just saying cover all aspects in your email with Ted, have him confirm all of that information.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: I'm actually typing out an email right now to my team.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: I just thought of the last thing I wanted to ask, too.
**Bclymer**: As far as the permits for electrical.
**Bclymer**: Where when I.
**Bclymer**: When I do choose my electrical contractor do, what is the permit number that I have to have them referenced to.
**Jdawson**: Get added to it?
**Aelkarrimy**: You just need the permit number.
**Aelkarrimy**: I'll send that over to you, Joe.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And does the perm.
**Bclymer**: Does the permit have all the.
**Bclymer**: Do we need permits for the conveying system that's on the ground and stuff like that, or was that all included with the racking?
**Aelkarrimy**: That is a good question.
**Aelkarrimy**: We'll have to double check on that.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: I just want to make sure.
**Bclymer**: I don't believe that the mechanical installation for racking needs.
**Bclymer**: I don't think they need a contractor license in Jersey to do the install for racking, but I do want to make sure of the guys who are going to be coming out to it because it's going to be a separate crew that's installing the conveyor and stuff like that.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: But I just want to make sure.
**Bclymer**: Because we are coming up on those dates, and I want to.
**Bclymer**: If we got.
**Bclymer**: If I got to submit for some permits, I know I will for electric, but I want to make sure that I'm covered on mechanical as well.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah, I got that permit number for you.
**Aelkarrimy**: It's 25-0207.
**Jdawson**: Thank you.
**Aelkarrimy**: And to answer your question, Ahmed, they did not take rebar out when they cut.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bryan.wagar**: So that's why definitely, we'll need to have Ted confirm that a truck can drive on that slab.
**Bryan.wagar**: Joe.
**Bryan.wagar**: So as long as the warehouse folks have done it before, definitely they would know if they can, since they have that driveway on the corner, which means that they definitely bring cars in, but just confirm it within.
**Bryan.wagar**: Just cover all corners.
**Bclymer**: Would you have anything else to.
**Bclymer**: I think that's all I got.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: If, Mike, if you can find out a little bit more about what is needed on these permits or not, and I can make sure that I stay ahead of that.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Mparsons**: Thank you very much, guys.
**Bclymer**: Thank.
**Bschwartz**: Thank you, Kevin.
**Bschwartz**: Sorry, I forgot I had one item.
**Bschwartz**: Can you have your team submit an RFI on that fire sprinkler question that Brandon brought up on the alternating racks.
**Bschwartz**: Per FM 38.
**Bschwartz**: 34.
**Bschwartz**: Okay, just so we can formalize our response on that.
**Mparsons**: Gotcha.
**Mparsons**: All right, we'll.
**Mparsons**: We'll put that together and send it out.
**Bschwartz**: Thank you.
**Jdawson**: You're welcome.
**Mparsons**: Thanks, everyone.
**Bclymer**: Thank you.
**Jdawson**: Thanks, everyone.
**Bschwartz**: Thanks, all.
**Jdawson**: Thank you.
**Bryan.wagar**: Oh, Nina sent.
