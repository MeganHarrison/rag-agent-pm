## Transcript
**Dmiles**: Emma.
**Dmiles**: Hello.
**Mlehman**: Is there anyone else from parallel that's going to be joining?
**Lhoran**: Nope, it's just me today.
**Mlehman**: Awesome.
**Mlehman**: Okay, well give Mark or Dan or Lauren just a couple more minutes to hop on.
**Mlehman**: We'll get going.
**Lhoran**: Okay, sounds great.
**Ahuettl**: Hey, gents.
**Mlehman**: Hey, Dan.
**Ahuettl**: We can get started until Mark joins if you want.
**Mlehman**: Yeah, for sure.
**Mlehman**: Okay, so I think Emma's the only one from parallel joining, so I'll just start with Alex if you want to give us some site updates.
**Mlehman**: I know electrician started today.
**Mlehman**: Alex, I'll let you take it from there.
**Lydia**: Okay.
**Dmiles**: Yeah.
**Lydia**: Last week we got the walls framed up.
**Lydia**: The reception desk is also framed.
**Lydia**: Swift Air mechanical was here, started H Vac rough in sprinkler got completed and electricians are here now, so.
**Lydia**: So should have in wall rough end done by the end of this week.
**Dmiles**: Great.
**Mlehman**: Awesome.
**Mlehman**: So, Dan, we wanted to get on your schedule.
**Mlehman**: Yours are marked schedule here Friday morning.
**Mlehman**: I expect to have 95% of our rough and complete for electrical.
**Mlehman**: So if we want to do just one last walk before we call in our inspection and close up walls, we can do that.
**Mlehman**: So let's tentatively, we'll have Alex or me will send out an invite for that on site, but probably around like 9, 10am if that's okay.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah, I'm off Friday, but I'll make sure Mark knows about it and either him or somebody else will be there.
**Mlehman**: Awesome.
**Mlehman**: Awesome.
**Mlehman**: Alex, anything else as far as side updates go?
**Mlehman**: Oh, here's Mark.
**Mlehman**: Hey, Mark.
**Bclymer**: You guys done already?
**Bclymer**: No, we're just.
**Mlehman**: We just got.
**Mlehman**: We just got done with some side updates.
**Mlehman**: Mark, we're gonna be done with our rough in electrical at least 90 to 95 done by Friday and which is right on par with our schedule.
**Mlehman**: So if we want to plan for doing that, that site walk Friday morning and then we can take a look at all of our electrical outlets and we can get your blessing and then we'll call in our inspection and we'll start getting walls covered next week.
**Dmiles**: Okay.
**Dmiles**: All right.
**Ahuettl**: Mark, I wasn't going to be here Friday because you're not.
**Dmiles**: Can.
**Ahuettl**: Will you be or can we get somebody to be in attendance for that?
**Bclymer**: I can be here Friday.
**Dmiles**: Yeah.
**Dmiles**: Okay.
**Dmiles**: All right.
**Dmiles**: Yep.
**Dmiles**: Great.
**Dmiles**: Yep.
**Mlehman**: And it, it should only take.
**Mlehman**: Take 30 minutes.
**Dmiles**: Yeah.
**Mlehman**: Assuming we're doing our job right.
**Mlehman**: It should only take 30 minutes.
**Dmiles**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So there's not, there's not a tremendous amount of.
**Bclymer**: I mean, yeah, the mail room and the conference room and the front desk.
**Bclymer**: The other stuff is just kind of whips things that would be done in the future.
**Ahuettl**: So I, I went in this morning and wow.
**Ahuettl**: I couldn't believe how big the mail room was.
**Bclymer**: It's like, yeah, we're gonna have a lot of space and that's even shrinking it a little bit.
**Bclymer**: 10 inches or something because of that.
**Dmiles**: Wow.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah, I guess when the casework and everything goes in, it gets a lot smaller, so.
**Dmiles**: Right.
**Mlehman**: Oh yeah.
**Mlehman**: It'll.
**Mlehman**: It looks really big now, but once that case works in there, you're losing a good four foot, probably so.
**Dmiles**: Sure.
**Bclymer**: Did.
**Bclymer**: Did Dave get to go over.
**Bclymer**: You know, Dan, I don't know if.
**Ahuettl**: Dave's had a look at it.
**Ahuettl**: In fact, I haven't seen him in the office in a while, so probably not.
**Dmiles**: Right.
**Bclymer**: But you're done with the, with the ductwork.
**Lydia**: Ductwork is still going.
**Lydia**: We are done with.
**Lydia**: Okay, sprinkler and okay, start.
**Lydia**: We started electrical today.
**Dmiles**: Okay.
**Dmiles**: All right.
**Dmiles**: So.
**Mlehman**: So guys, a critical item I have on my list is, is, is Hound and Swift Air for the.
**Mlehman**: For the remainder of these submittals for you guys to look at.
**Mlehman**: So expect that here in the next two days.
**Mlehman**: Okay, I'm gonna go ahead and sit, send you what I have and we'll just go from there.
**Bclymer**: Okay, perfect.
**Mlehman**: That's all I had as far as site updates.
**Mlehman**: I know.
**Mlehman**: Emma, we're working through the job planner submittal question you had.
**Mlehman**: For now.
**Mlehman**: If you just want to mark as approved and then just.
**Mlehman**: It gives you an opportunity to up.
**Mlehman**: Upload plans and if you just can stamp them or redline them or something, I think that should be sufficient to get your point across and Okie dokie.
**Mlehman**: And we can go about it that way.
**Lhoran**: Sounds good.
**Lhoran**: I will do that here shortly.
**Dmiles**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Had you cut in the poke through or is that something that's gonna be happening this week for the conference room?
**Mlehman**: We need to coordinate that Mark and we'll make sure we give you plenty of heads up and especially giving.
**Mlehman**: I think it's RD group below you guys a heads up.
**Mlehman**: So that'll probably happen around 6, 6am and right now we don't have it on the schedule, but that'll be critical here in the next two weeks to get done before we want to start moving on to flooring.
**Bclymer**: Have you looked at where it's coming out in their space?
**Mlehman**: It looks like it's just a.
**Mlehman**: And I need to confirm this, but when I went down there, it's like a.
**Mlehman**: Like a training area or some.
**Mlehman**: Or of some sort.
**Mlehman**: So it doesn't look like it's occupied all the time.
**Bclymer**: Is it A open ceiling.
**Mlehman**: I was, I was just able to, to peek through, through the crack in a door.
**Mlehman**: So I, I don't have an answer to that.
**Mlehman**: But Alex has been working, you know, daily with their on site maintenance guy.
**Bclymer**: I think his name.
**Lydia**: Yeah, so.
**Mlehman**: So when the time comes to get all that coordinated, which will be soon, we'll make sure we're ahead of it.
**Dmiles**: Okay.
**Mlehman**: All right, well, from a site standpoint, any, any questions you guys have for us as far as schedule goes.
**Mlehman**: Right now we're following that schedule I sent out to a tee.
**Mlehman**: So if you have any questions here in the next couple weeks as we start getting more into the finishes, once we start finishing drywall, I'll send another.
**Mlehman**: I usually do like a two week look ahead every, every week as we start getting towards the finish line in September because it's, you know, a lot, a lot of moving parts that last 20% of the job.
**Ahuettl**: And speaking of that, the existing VAV boxes are they.
**Ahuettl**: I haven't looked at your schedule in a while.
**Ahuettl**: Do you have that in the schedule too, the replacement in our existing space?
**Mlehman**: Dan, I don't, but let me, let me get that on a schedule for you and we can just go ahead and lock in dates here this week.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah, I mean, if I figured you were waiting to get lead time and all that and you know, when you'll have the material, but there, it's possible I'll send some guys home.
**Ahuettl**: So once you get a pretty good schedule going, I might clear the cubes under, you know, certain areas so that you can do the work unimpeded.
**Mlehman**: Okay.
**Mlehman**: Yeah.
**Mlehman**: Like I said, I'll give you at least a week's heads up on all that.
**Mlehman**: So.
**Ahuettl**: Okay.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah, and maybe it's, you know, you do the east zone first and the west however you want to do it or maybe, you know, it just takes a few days.
**Ahuettl**: I think it's going to take, you know, take some time, a week or two for all those.
**Dmiles**: But.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah, I might clear some people out from underneath you when you do that.
**Ahuettl**: So that's what I was asking.
**Mlehman**: Okay.
**Mlehman**: Yeah, I mean, it's getting to the point now where this has to get ordered this week.
**Mlehman**: So I'm putting pressure on Swift Air as far as getting you guys submittals.
**Mlehman**: And, and I just don't want it to bleed.
**Mlehman**: I don't want to be doing this, you know, trying to cram it all in in September.
**Mlehman**: I want to start at the latest middle of August.
**Dmiles**: Good.
**Ahuettl**: One of the other things that, and maybe Emma knows that Knows this as well, that we, you know, since we specified and designed the H VAC system, we're giving ourselves thermostats that we can adjust.
**Ahuettl**: You know, most lease spaces don't have thermostats you can adjust, but I'm paying for it, so that's what I was planning on putting in.
**Ahuettl**: Do you see that as a real problem for the owner?
**Dmiles**: Anybody?
**Ahuettl**: Anyone?
**Mlehman**: No.
**Mlehman**: I mean, if anything, you're making their building a lot better, so they should be happy.
**Mlehman**: That's kind of my take on it.
**Ahuettl**: I know no one provided me any details or tenant standards, if you will, or something like that.
**Ahuettl**: And that's why I kind of suggest maybe Emma got something, I don't know.
**Dmiles**: But.
**Ahuettl**: We didn't.
**Ahuettl**: And so we're kind of putting in what we want.
**Lhoran**: Yeah, there's nothing I know of tenant standards on my end, but if that's something that you'd like us to reach out, I'm sure that you could figure out.
**Ahuettl**: Well, I don't know.
**Ahuettl**: If I reach out, I might get an answer I don't want.
**Mlehman**: Yeah, when I.
**Mlehman**: When I asked.
**Mlehman**: I believe your name is Rebecca.
**Mlehman**: I'm blanking on it.
**Mlehman**: The property management team.
**Mlehman**: Now, I asked them everything they needed, and they were really only concerned about certificate of insurance.
**Mlehman**: They didn't ask for plans.
**Mlehman**: They didn't ask.
**Mlehman**: They've been actually pretty easy to work with.
**Mlehman**: Pretty hands off.
**Dmiles**: Okay.
**Mlehman**: I. I'm going to say that no, no news is good news in this sense.
**Mlehman**: Let's just leave it at that.
**Mlehman**: And if they, you know, if they're going to start balking at.
**Mlehman**: At putting in nicer thermostats, they probably have bigger issues, so I think we'll be okay.
**Ahuettl**: Well, what made me think of it is I, you know, these.
**Ahuettl**: These T stats we have now that are kind of locked down with a, you know, little Allen screw.
**Ahuettl**: I, you know, I open those up and adjust them, but the maintenance guy that comes, he.
**Ahuettl**: He just comes in and gets mad at me for opening it up.
**Ahuettl**: He closes all my blinds and.
**Ahuettl**: And huffs out, you know, like, kind of thing.
**Ahuettl**: And so, I mean, wait till he sees the thermostats I'm getting.
**Ahuettl**: I'm curious.
**Ahuettl**: I'm going to record that day.
**Dmiles**: Yeah, well, they.
**Bclymer**: They do have to understand that we're getting a digital control system, you know?
**Ahuettl**: Yeah, exactly.
**Bclymer**: And.
**Bclymer**: And they knew that.
**Bclymer**: They knew we were paying for it.
**Bclymer**: The owner did.
**Bclymer**: So he'd have to go to the owner and say, well, they have these.
**Bclymer**: I mean, I think the reason don't they have to do something with the pneumatic.
**Bclymer**: I mean, we can turn that wheel, but don't they have to recalibrate them with some sort of an air.
**Bclymer**: Little air thing that they.
**Bclymer**: And so my guess is, you know, we're not going to have recalibration or anything like that.
**Bclymer**: It's just a matter of where's our setting going to be, you know, are they, are they going to allow us to set it at, you know, not going to set it at 68 or something?
**Dmiles**: But.
**Ahuettl**: No.
**Dmiles**: Right.
**Bclymer**: It's something realistic.
**Bclymer**: But I think that that's what we are shooting.
**Bclymer**: We can adjust that per space now versus one big space on some of these, probably.
**Mlehman**: Right.
**Mlehman**: You know.
**Ahuettl**: Sorry, A.J.
**Ahuettl**: do you have Air balance in your proposal after we get all this terminal box work done?
**Mlehman**: Yeah, we'll balance it for you.
**Mlehman**: Now it's non certified, right.
**Mlehman**: You have to pay like a. I forget the companies that do it, but yes, we do balance it and give you, you know, we'll give you a letter saying it's balanced, you know, and obviously at the end of the project too, you know, we give you warranty letters, et cetera.
**Mlehman**: So contact list in case something happens, breaks.
**Mlehman**: So you'll have everybody from Swift Air's number that you need.
**Ahuettl**: Okay, so.
**Dmiles**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Are they using.
**Bclymer**: They're using a hood to take a measurement.
**Bclymer**: Is that what they're doing or no?
**Dmiles**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: I mean, when you say they're not certified, but they still.
**Mlehman**: Yeah, they, yeah, they'll use a hood and.
**Bclymer**: Okay, okay, I got you.
**Mlehman**: It's the same.
**Mlehman**: It's the same thing.
**Mlehman**: I believe you have to get and I don't know, to be honest with you guys, I, I know I've done a certified one once and I had to get a special company to do it, so.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I'm sure their equipment has to be certified every so often and.
**Mlehman**: Right.
**Bclymer**: That's probably a big difference or something.
**Mlehman**: Yeah, I find in most.
**Mlehman**: Pretty much, I would say 99% of the jobs I do and I use a lot of big H vac companies.
**Mlehman**: None of them ever give you a certified Air balance.
**Mlehman**: They just have to note that.
**Mlehman**: But they do balance it.
**Ahuettl**: Okay, that's good.
**Bclymer**: Alex, did the folks, the telecom folks reach out to you yet?
**Lydia**: Say that again.
**Bclymer**: I'm sorry, the telecom folks, did they reach out to you?
**Lydia**: I have not received any calls from them.
**Bclymer**: Okay, I'll.
**Bclymer**: I'll tweak those guys again and just make sure they touch base with you.
**Lydia**: Perfect.
**Lydia**: I'd appreciate that.
**Dmiles**: Yep.
**Mlehman**: Yeah.
**Mlehman**: Mark, if you don't mind because, you know, this drywall, if we get done with roughing, we're drywalling next week.
**Mlehman**: You know we're gonna have it finished.
**Mlehman**: I always give two weeks for finishing just because you don't know how quick it's gonna dry.
**Mlehman**: But it will probably dry quicker than that.
**Mlehman**: We're gonna be ready after that first coat of paint for sure for them to get in there.
**Mlehman**: Just so I like to get them in there right after first coat.
**Mlehman**: That way if they mark up any walls, we'll come through once and do all of our drywall touch up.
**Mlehman**: So you don't mind putting a little pressure on them to get with Alex, we can start working them in the schedule.
**Bclymer**: Yes, I will.
**Bclymer**: I will do that.
**Mlehman**: Okay.
**Mlehman**: Emma, anything from parallels end?
**Dmiles**: Nope.
**Lhoran**: And on our end.
**Mlehman**: Okay, well, we'll keep.
**Mlehman**: We'll keep at it, guys.
**Mlehman**: And space will be changing a lot here in the next coming weeks.
**Bclymer**: What's your.
**Bclymer**: What time do you guys usually close up?
**Bclymer**: Is it 3:30 or 3:30?
**Lydia**: 4:00'.
**Lydia**: Clock?
**Dmiles**: Okay.
**Dmiles**: All right.
**Bclymer**: And what time do you want to do the Friday walkthrough?
**Lydia**: What time works for you?
**Mlehman**: Yeah, you tell us.
**Mlehman**: What works for you?
**Bclymer**: I mean, will you be good to go in the morning?
**Dmiles**: Yeah.
**Dmiles**: Okay.
**Lydia**: Yeah, I hear.
**Dmiles**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: But I can come over around 8, be fine.
**Lydia**: Awesome.
**Lydia**: You got my number, so if anything happens, shoot me.
**Dmiles**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right, sounds good.
**Ahuettl**: All right, thanks, guys.
**Dmiles**: All right.
**Mlehman**: Yep, that's all I got.
**Dmiles**: All right.
**Mlehman**: See you guys.
**Bclymer**: See you.
**Lydia**: Thanks, everybody.
**Dmiles**: Thank you.
