## Transcript
**Dmiles**: It sitting over here right now.
**Mlehman**: Yeah.
**Mlehman**: Okay.
**Dmiles**: Aj.
**Lhoran**: Hey, sorry, guys.
**Lhoran**: I'm in the car.
**Lhoran**: So my video won't work, huh?
**Dmiles**: I'm not having that problem.
**Lhoran**: I don't have my.
**Lhoran**: Are you on your computer?
**Dmiles**: I am on my computer.
**Lhoran**: I'm not on my computer.
**Lhoran**: Mark, do you know who all from the applied team is going to be joining?
**Mlehman**: It may just be me.
**Mlehman**: I'm kind of just taking care of the construction.
**Mlehman**: Perfect interfacing.
**Lhoran**: So, yeah, we'll give it a couple.
**Lhoran**: We'll give it a couple minutes here.
**Lhoran**: See if anyone from parallel is going to hop on and then should be a quick one today, so.
**Mlehman**: Okay.
**Lhoran**: Hey, Emma.
**Lhoran**: Hey, Lydia.
**Ahuettl**: Hi.
**Ahuettl**: Good afternoon.
**Ahuettl**: Hi.
**Lhoran**: How's everybody doing after that pace or loss part break?
**Lhoran**: Very sad.
**Mlehman**: Plus, next year.
**Mlehman**: Yeah.
**Lhoran**: Yep.
**Lhoran**: Yeah.
**Lhoran**: And next year.
**Lhoran**: That's right.
**Lhoran**: Like, Dan's here.
**Lhoran**: Hey, Dan.
**Lydia**: Hey, Jay.
**Lydia**: Hi.
**Lhoran**: Well, we'll go ahead and get going now.
**Lhoran**: So Alex is on site with the demo guys.
**Lhoran**: They've been making a lot of noise.
**Lhoran**: We're going to keep that demo here all this week and should be wrapping up here closer to the end of the week.
**Lhoran**: Alex, you got any more site updates for us?
**Lhoran**: Nope.
**Dmiles**: We're doing great on demo.
**Dmiles**: Just working our way towards the applied engineering office.
**Dmiles**: So as we approach their.
**Dmiles**: Their area where they're working, it will get a little bit louder.
**Lydia**: I noticed the doors have been open most of the day.
**Lydia**: Have you guys gotten any complaints?
**Dmiles**: I haven't gotten any complaints.
**Lydia**: Okay.
**Lhoran**: Yeah, we're.
**Lhoran**: We're.
**Lhoran**: We're got.
**Lhoran**: We had.
**Lhoran**: At least on Friday when I was there, we had a lot of guys coming in and out, so.
**Lhoran**: Keeping the.
**Lhoran**: Keeping the landlord updated.
**Lhoran**: And so far, so good on that end.
**Lhoran**: So.
**Lydia**: Good.
**Lydia**: I.
**Lydia**: I know she didn't take the window out.
**Lydia**: So you just decided to use the elevator after all?
**Lhoran**: Well, the.
**Dmiles**: The window we're taking out so that we can get drywall up.
**Lydia**: Oh, so that's still gonna happen.
**Lydia**: Okay.
**Dmiles**: Yeah, it's still gonna happen.
**Dmiles**: That'll happen tomorrow.
**Dmiles**: Actually, it's caulked in from the exterior, which was unexpected.
**Dmiles**: So we got to get a boom lift out here and it's coming tomorrow.
**Lydia**: Gotcha.
**Lydia**: Okay.
**Lhoran**: Well, great.
**Lhoran**: You guys just.
**Lhoran**: You got my cell phone number.
**Lhoran**: Alex is on site.
**Lhoran**: So if anything comes up or you just want to pop over and.
**Lhoran**: And take a peek, feel free to.
**Lhoran**: We just asked that you wear a hard hat, so Alex will have some laying around for any visitors.
**Lydia**: Okay, thank you.
**Lhoran**: I'm tracking on.
**Lhoran**: On a couple things, Dan.
**Lhoran**: I will get you a price for that door for the mother's room.
**Lhoran**: Okay.
**Lydia**: Yeah.
**Lhoran**: I was going through my list here.
**Lhoran**: So I'll turn that around here today, hopefully.
**Lhoran**: And then other than that, pricing wise, is there anything else that you're looking for from us?
**Lydia**: No, I don't think so.
**Lydia**: You know, we opted to do the terminal box replacement on normal working hours.
**Lydia**: We'll probably just have those people work from home.
**Lydia**: If you're able to give us kind of week by week which boxes you might be replacing.
**Lhoran**: Definitely, yeah.
**Lhoran**: We'll give you at least the week's notice.
**Lhoran**: And once I have those submittals, I'll send those over to you guys.
**Lhoran**: That way you can check on them and give us the okay.
**Lhoran**: And I should have those here.
**Lhoran**: I gave them a deadline of tomorrow morning.
**Lhoran**: So once Swift Air gets me those, I'll forward them on to you and we can go from there.
**Ahuettl**: Aj, as you.
**Ahuettl**: I'm sorry, go ahead.
**Lydia**: No, go ahead, Libby.
**Ahuettl**: I was just going to mention now that you're talking about submittals if as you work on other specifications in their drawings, if you could.
**Ahuettl**: We have a construction administration scope for applied engineering for the project.
**Ahuettl**: If you could pass us those to myself and copy in Emma, that would be great and we can start to review those and help in our way.
**Lhoran**: Yeah.
**Lhoran**: Awesome.
**Lhoran**: That was actually my next question for you, Lydia, is who you wanted me to send those to from Parallels Team.
**Lhoran**: And we use Job Planner.
**Lhoran**: So we'll add you into Job Planner here.
**Lhoran**: And then I just got a casework submittal, so that answers that question.
**Lhoran**: I'll put you in the yes and we'll go from there.
**Ahuettl**: I was going to say if you can make Emma and I both a part of that process, that would be great.
**Ahuettl**: I am actually expecting and pregnant with twins.
**Ahuettl**: And so depending on how far the project goes out, we'll obviously both be online and available for the project.
**Ahuettl**: But it's just helpful to have two people who are in the know about things and so either both of her and I or just I myself can review and turn those around.
**Ahuettl**: Is there anything Applied Engineering Group, any submittals that you want to see outside of the kind of that MEP scope that you would also like to review or are you okay with parallel to review?
**Ahuettl**: What process are you comfortable with?
**Lydia**: Probably the case were I would think I.
**Lydia**: I don't think finishes.
**Lydia**: I think we've worked through that with you.
**Lydia**: Unless there's any changes.
**Lhoran**: Okay.
**Lydia**: Definitely the case work and then I assume lighting will come to us either way.
**Ahuettl**: So it's up to You.
**Ahuettl**: We.
**Ahuettl**: We also review lighting submittals.
**Ahuettl**: So if you want two sets of eyes, you know, we're happy to mark up what we see and then pass along to you or vice versa, you can look at it and pass it to us.
**Ahuettl**: It's whatever your preference is on that.
**Ahuettl**: I just want to make sure that you're involved in the submittals of mutis as well.
**Lydia**: Okay.
**Lydia**: Yeah, let's both see those.
**Ahuettl**: Okay, great.
**Mlehman**: Yeah.
**Lydia**: Yeah.
**Lydia**: That's all I can think of, Mark, unless you can think of something else.
**Mlehman**: No, I think the MEP and in that case would make sense if you wanna.
**Mlehman**: If you put my email in there, will they come to me then or will parallel forward?
**Mlehman**: How does it work with the.
**Ahuettl**: I think AJ can set up a workflow that both of us are a required reviewer for those search results that you just asked for.
**Mlehman**: Yep, let's do that and put my email on there.
**Ahuettl**: Okay, great.
**Ahuettl**: And then AJ, if you have any RFIs, like I said, just include both Emma and myself and we can help on those.
**Ahuettl**: And then as the project progresses, if there's stuff on site or whatever, just include us as much as you want and we can be present for those for sure.
**Lhoran**: Yeah.
**Lhoran**: My wife is actually expecting any day now, so I'm right there with you, Lydia.
**Ahuettl**: Okay.
**Ahuettl**: That's so exciting.
**Lhoran**: Yep.
**Ahuettl**: Well, if you think of anything that we can, you know, for the applied engineering team as well, you know we have that contract with you for construction administration.
**Ahuettl**: So anything that we can be of help on or if you want additional eyes, that's what we're here for.
**Ahuettl**: But we'll help cover most of those submittals and then send them to you to review as well.
**Lhoran**: Awesome.
**Lhoran**: Awesome.
**Lhoran**: Yeah.
**Lhoran**: I'll get everybody added to the workflow and then job planner kind of takes it from there.
**Lhoran**: It's great.
**Ahuettl**: Perfect.
**Ahuettl**: That's all from the parallel side.
**Ahuettl**: That was our only thing for today was just the middles.
**Ahuettl**: And then do you have a project timeline or a phasing date for the project or spreadsheet that we have haven't seen yet?
**Lhoran**: I do, Lydia, and that's.
**Ahuettl**: That's.
**Lhoran**: I apologize.
**Ahuettl**: Oh, that's okay.
**Lhoran**: I've been sharing that with applied.
**Ahuettl**: Not a problem at all.
**Lhoran**: Share.
**Lhoran**: We'll share the schedule with you as well.
**Lhoran**: And when we get you added the job planner, you can actually see it in there too.
**Lhoran**: So it's pretty cool.
**Lhoran**: It's got a whole calendar.
**Ahuettl**: That'd be great.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah, well, we would love to see that.
**Lhoran**: Well, great.
**Lhoran**: Mark or Dan, anything from the Applied team.
**Lhoran**: We haven't covered any questions?
**Lydia**: No, I don't think so.
**Lydia**: Given the heat, are you planning on kind of buttoning up the window each day, or is it just open one day and you're done?
**Lydia**: What's kind of the intentions with that window open and how long will it be open?
**Dmiles**: We'll have a plywood covering it.
**Lydia**: Okay.
**Dmiles**: For when it's.
**Dmiles**: It's not in use.
**Lydia**: Yeah.
**Ahuettl**: All right.
**Lydia**: It's awful hot in here today, is why I asked.
**Lydia**: I don't.
**Lydia**: I think the systems can barely keep up.
**Lhoran**: Yeah, we'll make sure it.
**Lhoran**: It's locked from the inside, so it's.
**Lhoran**: It's safe and secure with that plywood that we frame in.
**Lydia**: Okay, good.
**Lydia**: No, nothing else, I guess.
**Lhoran**: Yeah.
**Lhoran**: And as far as.
**Lhoran**: Once we get material in the building, as far as studs go and drywall, we'll.
**Lhoran**: We'll put that window back so it won't be super long that it's exposed.
**Lydia**: Okay.
**Lhoran**: Okay.
**Mlehman**: Sounds good.
**Lhoran**: Well, exciting stuff.
**Lhoran**: It's going to start changing a lot here the next couple weeks, so we'll keep.
**Lhoran**: Keep sending the reports out and sending photos, and I will reach out if anything comes up.
**Mlehman**: Hey, I do have a question.
**Mlehman**: On the wall that you guys did infill, is the owner what's taken care of on that side of it parallel or, you know, how is that set up for the corridor side?
**Ahuettl**: We have noted to apply those corridor finishes on those inbuilt places.
**Ahuettl**: So that'll have to be coordination between Alito and the landlord, if I'm understanding that.
**Ahuettl**: Right.
**Mlehman**: Okay.
**Lhoran**: Yep.
**Ahuettl**: We.
**Lhoran**: We'll get with Rebecca, and Alex has been in contact with Vern, who's their site and maintenance guy, you know, daily.
**Lhoran**: So.
**Mlehman**: Okay.
**Lhoran**: When they get.
**Lhoran**: When they get us some attic stock, we'll have our.
**Lhoran**: Our painters install that wall covering.
**Mlehman**: Okay.
**Mlehman**: Okay.
**Mlehman**: All right.
**Mlehman**: That's it.
**Lhoran**: Alrighty.
**Lhoran**: Well, short one today.
**Lhoran**: And hopefully we'll keep them short because we're making so much progress.
**Lhoran**: So we'll chat soon, guys.
**Lydia**: Thanks, A.J.
**Dmiles**: Thanks, everybody.
**Ahuettl**: Thanks, everyone.
**Lydia**: Thank you.
