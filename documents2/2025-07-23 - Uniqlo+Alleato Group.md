## Transcript
**Aelkarrimy**: All right, Kevin, can you tell if we're missing anybody?
**Bclymer**: Do we have Brian?
**Jdawson**: This is Eric harbor from Henderson.
**Kevin.ly**: Brian is out sick today so I'm sitting in for him.
**Bclymer**: Okay, gotcha.
**Mparsons**: All right, so we can go ahead and get started.
**Bclymer**: I'm going to share my screen Mike.
**Mparsons**: If you want to go through the side stuff.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah.
**Aelkarrimy**: So on site updates, the electrical team is continuing their feeder run from the HE1 panel to the power room and they are making good progress there.
**Aelkarrimy**: They completed pulling all the lines all the way down.
**Aelkarrimy**: So now they're just securing the lines and they're in front of the power room area and security they've been, they've been very helpful with blocking off certain areas for us.
**Aelkarrimy**: So it's, it's been as smooth as it can be.
**Aelkarrimy**: And then we had our plumbing crew arrive to site and they completed the demo and they completed the installation of the floor sink clean out and the sand oil separator and we have a inspection scheduled for tomorrow.
**Aelkarrimy**: So that's going well.
**Aelkarrimy**: And then in addition to that, Exotech is continuing their mobilization.
**Kevin.ly**: Mike, I'm so sorry for my ignorant comment but did you say oil sand separator?
**Mparsons**: Yes, the oil water separator.
**Kevin.ly**: Oil water separator.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: And then I got you.
**Aelkarrimy**: I gotcha.
**Aelkarrimy**: Is there any additional questions for anything on site right now?
**Mparsons**: Okay, we'll move on to the open chain orders.
**Mparsons**: So right now we still don't have that season under transformer search so they're still open.
**Mparsons**: We still, we also have a permit change order that we sent out last week.
**Mparsons**: We don't have a decision on that yet as well.
**Mparsons**: And also this week we sent out an exchange waterlog.
**Mparsons**: Friday I sent it out for insurance.
**Bclymer**: And been going back and forth with Kevin and you just sent over some additional documents.
**Bclymer**: Those two if anyone wants to take a look.
**Mparsons**: And for the RFIs, the first two.
**Bclymer**: RFIs were already closed and I just opened a new one for these data.
**Mparsons**: Drops that we have on site.
**Mparsons**: I think we briefly discussed last week, I guess we thought they were power drops but they actually data drops after.
**Bclymer**: Taking a closer look and Mike was able to get all of them tracked.
**Mparsons**: And we have all the locations marked here in this document that I have.
**Bclymer**: Attached to the meetings and.
**Mparsons**: They'Re all tracked and we have the location of the cabinets that they are coming from.
**Mparsons**: There are three cabinets inside that all the data the data drafts are connected to.
**Bclymer**: So we need to find out from.
**Mparsons**: I guess from exotic or from uck if we can go ahead and use Those and then.
**Bclymer**: Yes, if that works, then we can write a credit for it, since these.
**Mparsons**: Are already on site.
**Kevin.ly**: Jesuke, do you think you can run this by Damian just to see if this is acceptable?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah, I'll double check with Damien.
**Kevin.ly**: And this is RFI number three on job planner.
**Kevin.ly**: So you just need to export it and just send it to him if possible.
**Kevin.ly**: If you're not able to, just let me know and I can do that for you.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay, I'll try.
**Mparsons**: All right.
**Mparsons**: Anything anyone wants to add?
**Kevin.ly**: This means we're.
**Kevin.ly**: We're going to proceed with the original locations of the drop downs, right?
**Kevin.ly**: For the.
**Kevin.ly**: The outlets at this point.
**Mparsons**: Yes.
**Kevin.ly**: Gotcha.
**Mparsons**: Yeah.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: All right, Keba, I think what we'll.
**Kevin.ly**: Do is Yusuke is going to try to just coordinate this with IT team just to make sure that they're okay with utilizing these data drops.
**Kevin.ly**: So just give us a few days, just until Yusuke just touches base with me, and then I'll.
**Kevin.ly**: I'll try to get you guys a response on that right away.
**Mparsons**: Okay, I'm editing the RFI and I'm going to add you on your CK to it so you guys can add comments.
**Mparsons**: And it should be ready to go.
**Mparsons**: And I have it set for.
**Mparsons**: Since we are not getting to it, but I have it set for Monday.
**Bclymer**: Due date, so maybe I'll change it to Tuesday.
**Kevin.ly**: You needed Monday.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Sorry, Ahmed, I just only have to check the location, right?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Location is correct or not?
**Mparsons**: The locations are all marked on here.
**Mparsons**: Okay, so they are all correct.
**Mparsons**: And they are connected to cabinets, these three cabinets on site.
**Mparsons**: So you just need to confirm if you guys are okay with us using those.
**Mparsons**: Because they are at the exact locations that the drawings are asking for us to put new drops at.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay, so locations are already correct and.
**Mparsons**: Yes.
**Mparsons**: And so the RFI has this drawing attached, and if you zoom in, you can see there are pictures attached to it.
**Mparsons**: And if you open this, you can see pictures of each drop.
**Mparsons**: It just opens it and it shows you what is there.
**Bclymer**: So each location has an attachment to.
**Mparsons**: It with the picture.
**Bclymer**: And.
**Kevin.ly**: So the green lines are already run.
**Kevin.ly**: You're not saying like we're running any sort of data from that cabinet to that location.
**Kevin.ly**: You're saying those outlets, I'm sorry, those data ports are currently in those positions, right?
**Mparsons**: Correct.
**Mparsons**: So this green line here, here shows you that this one is connected to.
**Bclymer**: This cabinet, and this one is as well here.
**Mparsons**: So this one up here is connected.
**Bclymer**: To this cabinet that's located here.
**Kevin.ly**: So Keba, are we saying that we will relocate them to the locations that we want based off of these existing locations.
**Kevin.ly**: So we'll try to relocate.
**Kevin.ly**: Is that what we're saying?
**Mparsons**: No, they don't need to be relocated.
**Mparsons**: They are at the locations that the drawings ask for.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Kevin.ly**: As long as it's.
**Kevin.ly**: It's right there, then that's good.
**Kevin.ly**: The only question there is where they're terminated.
**Kevin.ly**: Is that acceptable?
**Kevin.ly**: Or do we need to extend them on to a different location where they actually terminate?
**Kevin.ly**: So they're in the right spot and the end point.
**Kevin.ly**: It's just where do they start from?
**Kevin.ly**: So Yusuke, if you can just also just confirm with Damien that if we can move certain tables where those printers are located to where these data ports are currently based off of that image.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Kevin.ly**: Which they're very plus or minus.
**Kevin.ly**: They're only like a foot off from each other.
**Aelkarrimy**: Really?
**Kevin.ly**: It doesn't look like it's too far.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay, I'll just double check if there is any problem with the current situation.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: That's it, right?
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah, that's it.
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah, because they're.
**Kevin.ly**: They're in the right spots and like there's a picture next to each data port.
**Kevin.ly**: So just let Damian know that and if he's okay with these locations, then we have a little savings here.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: All right, Got it, Got it.
**Mparsons**: All right.
**Kevin.ly**: Eva, is there any way you could just let us know if we're not going to proceed with installing new data ports?
**Kevin.ly**: Like, what is the credit back for the Uniqlo folks?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Sure.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Thank you.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: Anything else.
**Bryan.wagar**: From Exo?
**Bryan.wagar**: From Exotech side?
**Bryan.wagar**: I just wanted to.
**Bryan.wagar**: Are we squared away with the sprinklers right now?
**Jdawson**: With the.
**Jdawson**: What we talked about on Friday?
**Mparsons**: Yes.
**Mparsons**: So Henderson has.
**Mparsons**: They have made changes that you guys pointed out.
**Mparsons**: And this is sent to our sprinkler head designer that's working on the fabrication list.
**Mparsons**: So there's.
**Mparsons**: Yeah.
**Bryan.wagar**: So did Hugo approve the.
**Bryan.wagar**: The newest ones?
**Jdawson**: Did he look them over?
**Mparsons**: So when Henderson made their comment on the rfi, they sent it over to him.
**Mparsons**: I guess I can ask if he's.
**Bryan.wagar**: No, I'll ask him.
**Bryan.wagar**: I just didn't see an email come through, that's all.
**Mparsons**: Yeah, I think he sent it out on Friday, I believe.
**Bclymer**: Actually Monday.
**Bclymer**: Sorry, I'll.
**Bryan.wagar**: I'll follow up with Hugo.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And then the.
**Bryan.wagar**: The only other thing that I had was if you saw my email about our two week delay to start racking, just so you can notify your sprinkler team.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bryan.wagar**: It should have been.
**Jdawson**: Well, I don't see it in your inbox.
**Bryan.wagar**: Like I want to make sure you got it.
**Kevin.ly**: Okay.
**Bryan.wagar**: Just, I just want to make sure I didn't, you know, I forgot to hit send or something like that.
**Jdawson**: And it's still sitting here on my desktop somewhere.
**Aelkarrimy**: I got you.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Is that 3:17?
**Kevin.ly**: There's something.
**Bryan.wagar**: I replied all to the meeting invite.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: But Eva is not.
**Mparsons**: Yeah, I don't have it for some reason.
**Bclymer**: Mike, you can forward it to me.
**Mparsons**: If you have it.
**Jdawson**: I. I just sent it to you.
**Mparsons**: Okay, thank you.
**Mparsons**: Got it.
**Bryan.wagar**: So the, the original expected.
**Jdawson**: So this delay is due to the floor marking machine at another site on the other side of the country.
**Jdawson**: They were shipped out there.
**Jdawson**: One of them was damaged in the delivery and I think it.
**Jdawson**: And it wasn't found out immediately.
**Jdawson**: So they sent the robots to do some markings.
**Jdawson**: They find out that it was malfunctioning and, and they weren't able to repair it.
**Jdawson**: So instead of having three robots that are now down to two, which has put a significant delay on the markings at this much larger site.
**Jdawson**: And he's not going to be able to start with the markings until the 18th of August.
**Jdawson**: And then it'll be about two to three weeks to complete the markings.
**Jdawson**: But we will start racking as he finishes, you know, halfway through the Skypod one.
**Jdawson**: Just so everybody knows, these markings usually go at night.
**Jdawson**: These sets, they get set up and they run overnight.
**Jdawson**: They don't run during the day when everybody's there.
**Jdawson**: So they should not be in anybody's way.
**Jdawson**: But we do have to be mindful to move.
**Jdawson**: We're going to have to move the lay down space to keep them out of where the sky pods are going to be in order to get these markings done.
**Kevin.ly**: Got it.
**Jdawson**: So the original plan was not to start, was to unload for the first week of August and then start uprights on August 11th.
**Jdawson**: And we are now putting the first uprights to go on.
**Jdawson**: They go up about August 25th.
**Mparsons**: Okay, that's 25th as in 2, 5.
**Bschwartz**: So keep in mind too, once we.
**Bschwartz**: Once the floor marking is, we need a week to do our lights before racking goes up.
**Bryan.wagar**: Well, like I said, he's starting on the 18th.
**Bryan.wagar**: We're not going to be putting up.
**Jdawson**: Anything until the 25th.
**Jdawson**: As he goes as it, as the floor markings go, you'll be able to see where, you know, the fence line and everything is going to be.
**Jdawson**: So it should be.
**Jdawson**: I think you should have plenty of time because he's going to have to complete almost the first skypod in order to.
**Jdawson**: For us to start the Racking, too.
**Jdawson**: So as he goes on, you guys should have the entire floor to yourselves.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yep.
**Bschwartz**: Yeah.
**Bschwartz**: So we just got to stay in front of it.
**Bschwartz**: And then as far as the data goes, like, we took the data out to save money.
**Bschwartz**: Originally, we had all the data in, and it was taken out, and UNIQO is doing that themselves.
**Bschwartz**: I put dollars to donuts that those drops that are there are what the UNICO data team already did.
**Jdawson**: Okay, that makes sense.
**Bschwartz**: So no money back, AKA is what I'm saying.
**Jdawson**: That's why these data drops are in the exact locations needed.
**Bschwartz**: Yeah, we're not that lucky, guys.
**Kevin.ly**: Oh, so this was coordinated.
**Kevin.ly**: This was coordinated with Damien.
**Bschwartz**: Correct.
**Bschwartz**: This was already done.
**Cheryl.green**: Got it.
**Cheryl.green**: Got it.
**Kevin.ly**: Yes.
**Kevin.ly**: Now, we were just not notified on that, so that's why we didn't know.
**Bschwartz**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bschwartz**: That would be a first.
**Bschwartz**: If something was just in the perfect location, just coincidentally.
**Bryan.wagar**: I'm just shocked.
**Kevin.ly**: You know, every single location was on the money.
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah.
**Kevin.ly**: All right, so, Kevo, the one thing that I just like you to do is given these new dates, if you can update the construction schedule just so then we get an understanding the critical path items and how those are impacted or if they're not, that's a good thing.
**Kevin.ly**: But just want to make sure that everything is always updated on that schedule just so then we can see what's red and what's not.
**Mparsons**: Gotcha.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah.
**Bryan.wagar**: The overall schedule should not be impacted.
**Jdawson**: The racking team is going to work on Saturdays.
**Jdawson**: We will make up the time.
**Bryan.wagar**: I'm going to put together also a.
**Jdawson**: Spreadsheet, and I'll get with Aliato to see if there's any way we can mend the two together.
**Jdawson**: That kind of just shows this is how much racking we were planning on having done by this date.
**Jdawson**: You know, just a weekly, how much racking is put in compared to the original schedule.
**Jdawson**: And then we'll hopefully quickly be able to show, once we get ramped up, that we're doing more racks each week than we anticipated, so we will definitely catch up.
**Kevin.ly**: But does that mean that the sprinkler tooling needs to also ramp up along with the ramping up of these verticals or these uprights that are going up?
**Bryan.wagar**: The sprinkler generally goes in a lot.
**Jdawson**: Faster than the racking does.
**Jdawson**: So they, for them, they're never really playing catch up.
**Kevin.ly**: They're just waiting on the racks to go up, and then they're just following suit.
**Kevin.ly**: As long as the racks are gone.
**Bryan.wagar**: Like, they won't even come in.
**Jdawson**: They won't even come in on Saturday because if they're caught up by the end of Friday, everything that gets done on Saturday means when they show up on Monday, they'll have stuff to do right away.
**Mparsons**: Okay, so there's no impact to the.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Elato sprinkler work, Is that correct?
**Bschwartz**: Even if they're racking, that's not necessarily the case.
**Bschwartz**: We're going to plug the dates into the schedule.
**Bschwartz**: What Joe is saying is that with the durations that we have, basically this, you know, week or two week delay can be absorbed over the course of the entire installation period.
**Bschwartz**: So to say there's no impact would not be accurate.
**Bschwartz**: But what we're saying is that, you know, we don't believe that right now it's going to impact your end date.
**Bschwartz**: So we're going to plug things in, you know, to see what that does.
**Bschwartz**: But it will have an impact on the sprinkler.
**Bschwartz**: What we're looking for is to try to make sure it doesn't have an impact on your end date.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay, how about like, man hours for you?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: You guys, no updates again.
**Bschwartz**: What do you mean?
**Bschwartz**: Like, will it.
**Bschwartz**: Will it take more man hours?
**Kevin.ly**: Will there be added man hours?
**Kevin.ly**: Is what I think Yusuke is trying to say to pick up the schedule when you did it.
**Bschwartz**: It's.
**Bschwartz**: It's too early to talk to tell right now.
**Bschwartz**: With.
**Bschwartz**: With just two weeks and a year to install, I would say no.
**Bschwartz**: You know, is my first, you know, response.
**Bschwartz**: I don't believe it's going to take any more.
**Bschwartz**: I mean, the amount of man hours that it takes to install the sprinkler is the same.
**Bschwartz**: The only difference is if for some reason, because they're picking up a day, a week, if we have to pick up ours and say we got to run an extra crew or something, that's the only way is if we had to pick up, you know, that extra time.
**Bschwartz**: But as far as the amount of hours it takes to install, that wouldn't change.
**Bschwartz**: It's just if for some reason, you know, these guys are blowing through it and we want to not slow them down.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Gotcha.
**Kevin.ly**: Gotcha.
**Kevin.ly**: But there is a.
**Kevin.ly**: There is a potential where.
**Kevin.ly**: Let's say we'd still continue with what Joe just said.
**Kevin.ly**: The sprinkler installation is a lot faster than the racking installation.
**Kevin.ly**: So there will be a point where the sprinkler sub catching up to wherever the racking has stopped.
**Bschwartz**: I. I feel yes.
**Bschwartz**: I mean, that's.
**Bschwartz**: That typically, typically in our installations, we are going to be, you know, faster Than the racking, you know.
**Bschwartz**: But again, I've.
**Bschwartz**: There's been situations where that they are so fast at the racking that I'm like, hey, let me buy you lunch.
**Bschwartz**: Just take two hours so I can catch up.
**Cheryl.green**: Gotcha.
**Kevin.ly**: Gotcha.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: Anything else, Yusuke?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: No, I'm good, thanks.
**Bclymer**: If there's nothing else, we'll cut it.
**Mparsons**: Short today.
**Kevin.ly**: Before we terminate Yusuke.
**Kevin.ly**: Are we all clear with the.
**Kevin.ly**: The panel and the transformer that's installed between the.
**Kevin.ly**: The tenant, the adjacent tenant space and our space?
**Kevin.ly**: Is that all confirmed?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Jason Tenant.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Mike, did you talk with Ted about this one?
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah, he just said we need to give him a date and we can't.
**Aelkarrimy**: There's no way to give him an accurate date right now.
**Aelkarrimy**: But it's going to be a maximum of three days that we would be in their space with a lift.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And I think we haven't received any reply from Ted yet or the sublease.
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah.
**Kevin.ly**: So can you please just follow up with the sublease to make sure that Ted's findings and Mike's effort is.
**Kevin.ly**: Is acceptable?
**Kevin.ly**: That's.
**Kevin.ly**: That's the.
**Cheryl.green**: Yeah.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: All right, I'll follow up.
**Kevin.ly**: Kevin, you.
**Kevin.ly**: You gathered their insurance stuff, right?
**Kevin.ly**: For Kevin?
**Mparsons**: Yes.
**Kevin.ly**: I saw your respond though.
**Mparsons**: Yeah, but he just sent another email just now.
**Cheryl.green**: Yeah, I just got a response back from my team.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: They need more, but.
**Mparsons**: They need more you said?
**Cheryl.green**: Yeah, it's.
**Cheryl.green**: It's.
**Cheryl.green**: You'll see the email.
**Cheryl.green**: They.
**Cheryl.green**: It's better if they just talk with your broker.
**Cheryl.green**: That's more insurance related details than I.
**Bschwartz**: Give me, Give me your email for these guys.
**Bschwartz**: But here's the deal.
**Bschwartz**: Like I'm going to mark this change order as approved and I'm going to bill it this month.
**Bschwartz**: And if we want to, you know, curry up the.
**Bschwartz**: The, the backup, you know, over the next, you know, two weeks or whatever it takes to satisfy them, that's fine.
**Bschwartz**: But when we talked, we agreed that we were going to pull a special policy for this.
**Bschwartz**: And I told you guys, clearly this is going to be like over a hundred grand.
**Bschwartz**: So I, I don't want to get into a.
**Bschwartz**: Well, you know, it's not this much.
**Bschwartz**: Like there, there is no, you know, hey, this is too much thing like this is happening or like we're just going to drop the insurance and it's not going to be covered.
**Cheryl.green**: No, I understand, Brandon.
**Cheryl.green**: It's.
**Cheryl.green**: They just want to know make sure it's the right.
**Cheryl.green**: Unless I get this person to say yes, I can't get it signed.
**Cheryl.green**: My problem.
**Bschwartz**: Yeah.
**Bschwartz**: Give me their email and I'll.
**Bschwartz**: I'll hook our broker up and them.
**Bschwartz**: And.
**Bschwartz**: And you know, have them get.
**Bschwartz**: Get it all taken care of.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay, thanks.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Kevin.ly**: But I don't have anything else on my list, to be honest.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bryan.wagar**: I'm good over here.
**Mparsons**: Just.
**Kevin.ly**: Just wait.
**Kevin.ly**: One last thing.
**Kevin.ly**: I'm so sorry.
**Kevin.ly**: Just so everyone's aware.
**Kevin.ly**: So we did not issue the engineering bulletin and IFC set yet.
**Kevin.ly**: So I know that Eliato is just working off of TPG's in progress bulletin that hasn't been issued.
**Kevin.ly**: It has like a little progress stamp on it on the side, but that's currently the latest and greatest.
**Kevin.ly**: So you guys can still keep working off that until Henderson is just ready.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: To issue, which we won't be able.
**Kevin.ly**: To issue until we get a determination from Exotech on the power.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Cool.
**Kevin.ly**: Just to be clear, you're not waiting for something from Henderson?
**Aelkarrimy**: That's.
**Kevin.ly**: No, no.
**Kevin.ly**: You guys are waiting for the final direction on the output for the electrical.
**Kevin.ly**: And like, which approach for the transformers are we going to go with?
**Kevin.ly**: Okay, perfect.
**Kevin.ly**: Thank you.
**Kevin.ly**: Joe, I know that when you and I spoke that there was a.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: There was a hypothetical option that we.
**Kevin.ly**: Can approach if there are discussions of time delays or schedule delays, which was to just, you know, pull the trigger on the 480 volt transformers.
**Kevin.ly**: Is that still viable or is that not in the equation?
**Bryan.wagar**: It's viable right now.
**Jdawson**: I mean, the big meeting is tomorrow morning.
**Kevin.ly**: Got it.
**Kevin.ly**: Okay.
**Kevin.ly**: That's all I needed to hear.
**Bryan.wagar**: There's a lot of people above my.
**Jdawson**: Head on this meeting tomorrow, so.
**Jdawson**: And I know a lot of Uniqlo's leadership is also on it, so it is.
**Jdawson**: It is hopefully gonna have a.
**Jdawson**: We're gonna have, hopefully have an answer by the end of that meeting.
**Kevin.ly**: Praying for you guys.
**Kevin.ly**: Hopefully this thing gets resolved real quick.
**Jdawson**: I'm.
**Jdawson**: I just want an agreement, that's all.
**Jdawson**: Want us both to be happy.
**Kevin.ly**: Alrighty.
**Kevin.ly**: But I'm good from my end, so thank you, guys.
**Bclymer**: All right, thanks everyone.
**Jdawson**: Perfect.
**Bryan.wagar**: Zuki, if you can hang back.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: All right.
**Kevin.ly**: You suck it.
**Kevin.ly**: Do you need me at all or.
**Kevin.ly**: You're good?
**Kevin.ly**: I'm still stuck in the office for the next 30 minutes, so you.
**Kevin.ly**: You got me if you need me.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Bryan.wagar**: I just need you.
**Jdawson**: Ahmed, you can boot the fireflies.
**Jdawson**: So I think this is your meeting.
**Kevin.ly**: Gotcha.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Thank you.
