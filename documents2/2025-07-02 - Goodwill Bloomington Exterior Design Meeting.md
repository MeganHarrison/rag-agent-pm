## Transcript
**Amulder**: Yeah, we just wanted to go over what your concerns are for that and what you're hoping to see.
**Greulice**: Yeah, thank you.
**Greulice**: So, you know, just to kind of backtrack maybe a little bit, you know.
**Greulice**: So when we reviewed the plans for this and with folks about what was happening in the building, other than, you know, a loading dock happening on the east side of the building, everybody kept saying, you know, nothing was changing on the exterior, which is great.
**Greulice**: So the floor plans and the elevations showed that, you know, the windows and everything were being kept, which was great.
**Greulice**: And then we reached out and after someone had noticed that everything was being bricked up, blocked off.
**Greulice**: And so I reach out and, you know, there was apparently a note that was in the detailed plans that gave an option to Goodwill to completely enclose everything if they wanted to.
**Greulice**: So that, that was not something that we noticed.
**Greulice**: And we don't get to read through every single line of a plan for something.
**Greulice**: And so the concern is that our zoning code has certain design requirements for buildings that require certain design elements.
**Greulice**: So building, you know, this building here is grandfathered, you know, if it doesn't meet anything.
**Greulice**: But you can never do anything that brings yourself further out of compliance.
**Greulice**: So our zoning code has requirements for buildings, for commercial buildings that they have to have three out of four design elements.
**Greulice**: You know, those things are change in building height, projections or modulations along a building, incorporation of awnings and 50% glass along the ground floor of a building.
**Greulice**: So these elements have to be present along a building and modules not to exceed 40ft.
**Greulice**: And so like I said, you know, the building, while it didn't have all those things because it was built long before a current zoning requirement was in place for that, they can't bring themselves further out of compliance.
**Greulice**: So removing the glass, you know, brings them further out of compliance from that.
**Greulice**: And so I don't know, you know, what are the options?
**Greulice**: You know, the projections is going to be challenging because that is the projections or the recesses have to be at least 3% of the projection.
**Greulice**: The depth of that is at least 3% of the.
**Greulice**: What the building width is.
**Greulice**: So the building width, you know, it's not just your portion of the building, but it's the whole building from left to where Aldi's is, all the way to the far right.
**Greulice**: And so you know that that can be challenging because that's probably a 300 foot long building.
**Greulice**: So you're talking about a projection of almost nine feet, which is going to be challenging.
**Greulice**: So you, you might be able, through the Use of parapet, you know, get a change in building height of at least five feet.
**Greulice**: You know, that's fine.
**Greulice**: You can probably do that.
**Greulice**: The awnings, while they might look silly, you could, you could probably do that.
**Greulice**: But you're not going to get the projections.
**Greulice**: So I don't, I'm not, I'm not sure how that could be accomplished.
**Greulice**: So short of putting the windows back, I'm not sure what feasible options are on the table.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, this is Jerome Daxavich, I'm the director of design, dkg.
**Jdawson**: Our architects.
**Jdawson**: We're trying to help out here and come up with a resolution where everyone can be happy.
**Jdawson**: Obviously I know that goodwill just with their, their program and especially that, that area right there is all of their, their back of house there.
**Jdawson**: So it's, it gets slammed up pretty, pretty good in there.
**Jdawson**: So I think, I mean that was just to give the context.
**Jdawson**: I mean that's why they wanted to have those, those spandrel windows taken out.
**Jdawson**: There just was just to protect those.
**Jdawson**: That, you know, that facade that you're looking at, just, just that facade right there is 180 foot deep.
**Jdawson**: I mean wouldn't I know that with that 3%.
**Jdawson**: I think, I think we've got the building height change there.
**Jdawson**: I think we're.
**Jdawson**: That kind of entrance that is raised up there is noted for a, for a color change.
**Jdawson**: I know that's kind of one of the secondary desires is to break that up a little bit with the color change.
**Jdawson**: If we do go at in the awnings, like a fabric awning with an aluminum frame over there that projects out, you know, the three to four foot range, something like that obviously.
**Jdawson**: So it's not extending out past the, past the sidewalk.
**Jdawson**: Do you think that might be a good meeting point there to kind of meet the, meet your design intent to break that module up?
**Greulice**: Well, so there are lots of reasons for each of the different elements.
**Greulice**: So the awning can be one of those.
**Greulice**: But it's not going to carry the day.
**Greulice**: You know, like I said, you know, I'm not sure how we're going to meet that because you can't have, it's just going to be challenging to have a nine foot projection added on the building that garrows from the top, from the, from the ground to the ceiling.
**Greulice**: You know, it's not just, you know, here's one portion of the building that extends, but the whole building module, that whole 40 foot module has to extend 9ft or you know, 3%.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Which I'm not sure how you know, like, like so with, with right of ways and to, you know, stay within it, other than notching in the building, which, you know, anyone wants to do.
**Jdawson**: If we do add those to get that, I mean, I'm not, I don't think we're going to be able to get that.
**Jdawson**: We've got obviously the projection on the, on the other side there, if that can count towards some of that, some of that intent.
**Greulice**: But.
**Jdawson**: And if we do add in those, those awnings, you know, at those, at the, in between the brick piers, at those modules, if we add, add those in, maybe get, maybe look at some additional lighting in there.
**Jdawson**: We've got the material, you know, a color change at the entrance.
**Jdawson**: That's there.
**Jdawson**: We've got the, the already.
**Jdawson**: You've got the existing pop up.
**Jdawson**: I mean, that's all existing there.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: What, what would you think about maybe a horizontal aluminum louver that ran that whole length, that kind of shaded the sidewalk a little bit.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: It projected out three feet, like over the sidewalk along there.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: That would, and it just wouldn't be at the openings.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: It would just run all the way along there.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: So It'd be like 50ft or 60ft times three.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: And we just, you know, it was attached to the building and projected out and it would be a color to match the storefront frames on the other side of the building.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Is that clear analyzed?
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: You know.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Yeah, but we'd match those frames so it would be contextual.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Kind of butt up to the, to the entry there or whatever.
**Greulice**: Yeah, I mean, I, I hear, I hear, I hear what you're saying and what you're throwing out there.
**Greulice**: I just don't, you know, there's, there's nothing in the code that just says, oh, here are ways to mitigate these things.
**Greulice**: Here are four things.
**Greulice**: Three out of the four things that you've got to have in there.
**Greulice**: And they each stand kind of by themselves.
**Greulice**: So all these things that you've mentioned for awnings or extensions, that's great, and that satisfies one of them.
**Greulice**: But it's not like, oh, here's some combination.
**Greulice**: I mean, it is a combination, but you've got to have three out of these four.
**Greulice**: So you, you know, you, you've taken the glass off the table and I mean, I mean, honestly, you know, the challenge is just how do you, how do you fix something that that's already happened?
**Greulice**: So, I mean, we wouldn't have, you wouldn't have had to do any of these things if the glass had been staying like this, wouldn't even have been a discussion.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Yeah, that's why we're sitting here.
**Greulice**: Right.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Because some.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Nobody asked you.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: So we're, we'll get this, we'll get this resolved.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: What about if we, where the openings were?
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: It'd be a little itty bitty overbuild.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: There would be a storefront with spandrel glass in front of those before they've enclosed the opening.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: And then we did the awnings on top of that.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Does that make sense?
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: So it project out like 4 inches for the depth of the frame.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Then if you spand a glass in.
**Greulice**: Front of that, I mean the challenge, the challenge with that is it says a regular pattern of transparent glass.
**Greulice**: So what I'm, what I'm worried about is, and we deal with this a lot, you know, with spandle glass and people that want to use that is, you know, our code is very clear.
**Greulice**: We can't.
**Greulice**: So if we, if we allow that here, that, that's just going to be a problem precedent all over the place.
**Greulice**: Where in any and every other situation where we have been very clear, our code says you cannot do that.
**Greulice**: So I don't, I don't, I don't, I, I, unfortunately I don't think there's any flexibility on that because it's just very clear.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Are you, are you available, are you available next Tuesday to have another call?
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Let us do some renderings of some ideas and fill up on the screen.
**Greulice**: Yes.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Give us a chance to talk to the owner.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Is that okay with you, Elliotto?
**Greulice**: I mean, I, you know, so, I mean, you know, here is, I mean here is one thing to think about or consider.
**Greulice**: You know, you had X amount of square footage of glass.
**Greulice**: You know, I understand that they want to have, you know, solid wall up against there.
**Greulice**: So explore, you know, how to accomplish that amount of glass.
**Greulice**: Maybe through a series of transom windows that are up higher so you still have the same square footage of glass.
**Greulice**: It's just moved along that facade that, that might be an option.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Okay, I was going to bring that up.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: If it had to be at store level or if it could be transom.
**Greulice**: Style windows, it could be anywhere along each.
**Greulice**: So each facade would be a kind of a standalone review.
**Greulice**: Standalone side.
**Greulice**: Yeah.
**Greulice**: So like I said, whenever, whatever square footage of glass you had on that one side, just get that accomplished somehow some way on each respective side.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Okay, awesome.
**Amulder**: Okay, what time would everyone be able to meet on Tuesday?
**Greulice**: Next Tuesday I've got open at 4 o' clock or 11 o' clock.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: I can do.
**Amulder**: Okay.
**Amulder**: I'll schedule it for 11 on Tuesday then.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Perfect.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Then Jesse, we'll be in contact with you on what we're going to present obviously later this week and everything.
**Jcurtin**: Good.
**Jcurtin**: Thanks, Satan.
**Jcurtin**: So just a question.
**Jcurtin**: And so you're saying projection would be something of the new look of the building that projects out.
**Jdawson**: I mean it's.
**Greulice**: Yeah.
**Greulice**: So in, in a 100 compliant meet, what the zoning code wants is this is a, a, the whole portion of the building for that module from floor to ceiling sticks out that, that 3% of the length of the whole building.
**Greulice**: So like I said, you know, this building is something like 300ft long.
**Greulice**: So that'd be a nine foot section of the building that you would have to build onto that each respective side.
**Greulice**: Well, the south side, you know, the east side would be a little bit different because it's much shorter.
**Greulice**: But at this stage of the game, I don't, I mean, I don't even know what that would look like or how that would be realistic.
**Greulice**: I mean, you could do it.
**Greulice**: You'd have to tear down the interior wall to make it usable.
**Greulice**: But that's a whole different scope of work.
**Jcurtin**: And you said that.
**Jcurtin**: I'm sorry.
**Jcurtin**: The four elements like our glass, 50%.
**Greulice**: Glass awning or canopy that extends at least 24 inches, change in building facade height in relation to adjacent modules.
**Greulice**: At least 5ft of difference wall elevation, recesses or projections, the depth that are at least 3% of the width of the building.
**Greulice**: So you need three out of those four elements every 40ft along the facade.
**Greulice**: And so like I was saying, you know, the existing building, you know, it didn't meet that.
**Greulice**: It was close in some ways.
**Greulice**: But these requirements, these, these actual, this actual language came into the code long after this building was built.
**Greulice**: So it may not have met those.
**Greulice**: But like I was saying, you know, you can't bring yourself further from compliance, so you can't bring yourself out of, out of compliance there.
**Greulice**: Like you couldn't scrape off the parapet, you know, and not have the change in building height.
**Greulice**: You couldn't remove the windows, you couldn't remove the awnings because those were elements that were meeting or, you know, coming close to meeting what the zoning code requires.
**Jdawson**: Okay, sounds like we've got, we'll probably have a little bit of an internal conversation here, come up with a couple strategies that can get us.
**Greulice**: Yeah, so maybe the transom windows might be the best way to achieve that or get, get back to it.
**Greulice**: So.
**Greulice**: Yeah, see what you can come up with and draw up.
**Greulice**: And I'm happy to take a look at it next Tuesday.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Thanks.
**Greulice**: Okay, thanks, everybody.
**Jcurtin**: Thank you.
