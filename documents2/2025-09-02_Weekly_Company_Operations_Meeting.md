**Maria Calcetero:**
Okay, guys, let's go to this one one second project. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
So everyone, I just. I would like you to introduce you to Jim. It. You know, I sent out the email last week, so if everyone had a chance to review it or see it. But Jim's joining us and we can discuss, you know, how all that's going to work out moving forward. But he'll be the. He's currently our BP and he'll be helping us out really with everything we do as a company. And I will let you start the meeting. Maria.

**Maria Calcetero:**
Jessica, you want to go one by one to present themselves or you want to just start with the meeting right now? 

**Jesse Dawson:**
We got on here Alec Warner, he's an assistant PM here in the Tampa St. Pete office. 

**Alec Wehner:**
Hey, Jim, Nice to meet you. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Yeah, Alex from Indianapolis. So he just happens to like Florida better than Indy. Similar to me. And then see we got Jose, he's in a part of the accounting team. So when you get your credit card and you make a transaction, Jose keeps up on all that and payroll. We got Keba. Keba is an assistant PM here in St. Pete office as well. We got AJ Taylor here, he's our project exec in Indy. Glenn, he's a project manager in Indianapolis. Just gave him your phone number. So look out for a bunch of late night texts. And then I think that's all we got here. Nick is. He took this week off. He's down in the Keys Trying to get swallowed up by a water spout, it looks like. So he'll be on next week. It's like. Seems like we're missing somebody. Maybe not. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
You are missing me. I'm just kidding. It's fine. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Just Nick. Okay. 

**AJ Taylor:**
Did you mention Jesse? 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Yep. Oh, yeah. Jim and Jesse worked together in the past, so. 

**AJ Taylor:**
Oh, yeah, that's. 

**Jim Parker:**
I don't know either one of the Jesse's. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
That's right. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
All right. 

**AJ Taylor:**
Be on the team. Jim, thanks for. Thanks for being here. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Yeah, man. 

**Jim Parker:**
Look forward to seeing what y' all are up to. See what I can do to help. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Jim, I already asked you to your data for your credit card. Okay. So we can order it on time. Sounds good. 

**Jim Parker:**
Okay, sounds good. Thanks, Maria. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Perfect, guys. So let's start here. Let me just go ahead and share my screen with you one second, please. Wait, what is Nosh Pierce? Nosh. Okay, let's start. Alta Dallas ag. 

**AJ Taylor:**
I'm just waiting on some direction on what they want to do with the fire alarm that we still have left to bill for. I have projects built in full. Besides 5,500 bucks, they wanted to add some and now they're thinking of doing something else, so that job's pretty close to being closed out. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Okay, ig, thank you so much. Cratescape. 

**AJ Taylor:**
Just waiting for them to send our bond over to maintenance so we can pick it up. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Awesome. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Basket Saturday. 

**AJ Taylor:**
I did. Yeah. I don't want to talk about it. Wasn't fun. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Okay. Nick is not today, so let's move on. Google Bloomington is also new, correct? Yeah. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
So Nick is not out of Bloomington. Jesse, I don't know if you can update, but we have. We had the TCO inspection today and they're wanting us now to do additional drawing. So. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Andrew's typing it up too. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
There's. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
There's some additional corrective actions too. So I put an update on here for today, just not with TCO results because it was earlier this morning. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
And what is the. Like all of these things? I guess we got to get the civil engineer to address those comments first before we can find out what that date is for them to give a tco. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Yeah, I think what's going to ultimately determine it is how quick they are to get their internal answer on the handicap working. So spaces. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Well, Brian responded to me in a text and he's like, it's a shared shopping. Shopping mart, whatever it is, but they share all those spaces. He doesn't think it matters. So he was driving. I'm sure that means he was coming back from vacation or something, but we should have that. I would hope that's resolved in the morning, by the time he can take a look at it. And then Nick is confirming the ramp dimensions in an email I found, which we got to look at. Why that wasn't saved on the job file, but I will get that over to Brian and his guys so they can draw it to scale and then. Okay, gotta get with shot and make her add that to one of her drawings as well. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Who was shot. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
They're the architect of record and Kimley's the civilian. All right, go ahead, Maria. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Thank you, Jesse. CVA Consulting Building. Alec? 

**Alec Wehner:**
Yes. I'm going to revise this note here in a moment. This was based on my last conversation I had with the plan reviewer for the township last Friday. He said that we can expect the permit this week. I spoke to him this morning and he said that he issued the permit and the township can expect it in their hands today or tomorrow. So I'm going to follow up on that in the morning, but already spoke to Rob Ramsey, our subcontractor on site who's finishing the work, and he has their tester scheduled for Friday and we'll be completing the work that day as well. So all going according to plan, we should be closed out of that project by the end of the week. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
So. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Thank you, Alec. There's no comments or something. Let's move. Nick is not here, but you guys. Glenn. Westfield Collective. 

**Glenn Ducharme:**
Westfield Collective. We have the underground electrical and plumbing starting today in the collective side of the building. They already did the volleyball side. We're forming up the volleyball slabs for the ins for the north side and west side today to get those poured. This week we began our right of way grading out here on the north side of 181st Street. ZAO's dispatched their guys to get out here. Move that fiber optic box on the south side. We're waiting for confirmed date from them right now. The masonry continuing this week on the north wall and then moving to the south wall. We had volleyball netting get added that got approved by the city and then Katie approved the change order today. So right now the JR has that change request to approve and once that gets done, we'll order the polls and get those out here in the next few weeks and get those polls stood up when we pour the pad back there. Mechanical equipment from fight is being delivered on Friday. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
No other issues. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Okay. If there are no comments or something else, let's move on with Cormart. This is Alec. 

**Alec Wehner:**
Yeah, Cormar, I really. I have an open invoice still for legacy fire protection that was left open. They reached out to me and let me know that they had that. So that's just on my docket to take care of, but no work there. Just gotta play a couple final holes. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Thank you. Alec. This is Nick here. AJ Niemann holding FedEx. 

**AJ Taylor:**
Yeah, so we started framing the front entrance today. I think we're getting ready to roll on, hopefully being able to put our dins glass up either tomorrow or Wednesday. We're not sure yet if the inspector wants to come by and see anything behind there as far as our framing goes. Other than that, working on our gear for electrical service. Yeah, that's all we got going this week. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Thank you, A.J. danville Theater. 

**AJ Taylor:**
I'm just waiting on some selections from the owner. So right now we don't have anybody working on site. Once. Once I get those approved from him, I sent him a list of them with links last week. Once I get those approved, we'll be able to finish and knock that thing out, hopefully. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Awesome. Apply Engineer Office Remote aj yeah, we've. 

**AJ Taylor:**
Been running into some issues with. With our vavs. We actually ended up getting everything delivered on the site this morning though. Besides two of them out of the 18 and those are set to be delivered week of the 15th. I'm working with Cannon to try to get that expedited, but right now we're just working on VAV install and then we got to get two diffusers installed in the hard lid so we can start closing that up. Casework started today. We did find out that they went to install the casework in the conference room and their countertop is like 40 inches short. So the shop error on their end. I'm working on figuring out how quick we can get a new countertop made. 

**Jim Parker:**
Just get a cabinet stretcher. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Come on. 

**Jim Parker:**
Jesse knows where to pick them up. 

**AJ Taylor:**
You would think they would have them be nice, but that's why we get approved submittals, right? They were trying to say that they built what they had and they did not build correctly. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
So. 

**AJ Taylor:**
Good news is we were able to put the push this final date back till the end of September, so we got some time to get it figured out. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Thank you, aj. Jesse Dawson, Seminole Collective. Is he still on the phone? 

**AJ Taylor:**
You're muted, Jesse. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Oh. Both Seminole and Port Collective are waiting on the city, plus the owners out of the country. So he's going to have to get that agreement done with the city in both cases and then we can move forward. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Thank you, Jesse. We have Nick here. I Think he did his updates? No, that's fine. Keva, Unicorn, go ahead. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
On Tremont. I know Nick's gone, but we've released the design so that the design started. And then today, Bryce, the new Goodwill pm, sent me the info for the mechanical sub they're using. So I reached out to them to set up a meeting to discuss what they need for mechanical design that we'll end up doing for them. 

**AJ Taylor:**
Jesse, does Goodwill now have like their own project manager? 

**Jesse Dawson:**
When I say pm, it's like their manager, like Andrew, they got him a counterpart. So him and Bryce now you're working together on everything. Nice. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Thank you, Jesse. Eva, Uniqlo, New Jersey. 

**Kebba Mass:**
Yes, we have the electrician continuing their installation. They're doing the drop codes for the workstations now. And this afternoon we started the 2 inch pipe installation in the racking systems. And we ordered extra materials for the rises for the sprinkler system. We were running short. I think we underestimated some of the material. So I placed the order for that today. And also we were missing the U balls in our estimate, so I ordered those as well today. So we should be getting the U boss on Thursday and Rice materials on Thursday as well. We did get design and engineering pricing from Henderson for the air compressors and we have sent that to EXATEC for their review and approval. And we are also waiting for a W9 and a PO from Exotic for that change order under electrical changes. That's where we are at right now. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Just so you know. Or Kev, if you've seen the email Brandon sending that insurance information that they wanted. So we just need to be ready tomorrow. They get that, you know, if they approve all that information. Is the billing currently correct in amount you said, Brandon, Last month's draw. 

**Kebba Mass:**
Brandon sent the insurance information. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
He did. He sent that to Kevin. 

**Kebba Mass:**
Okay, the back on that email. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Well, I don't know if you were on it or not, but I'm just telling you tomorrow we should hear back and that'll finalize that billing. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Okay, thank you, Kev. AJ Maphis call is to Rush face. 

**AJ Taylor:**
Yeah, so Joe wrote me and Steve an email and asked for some backup. Jesse, for our general conditions. I sent them like our breakdown in our bill, like the G703 summary. And then he just responded. He wanted a breakdown of the general conditions with backup. So that's basically our cost. And so I was going to ask, what do you think I should put together to show that to him? Should I just put a simple spreadsheet and just bill our Time, basically. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
I mean, if we have time and rate sheets for yourself and myself and Brandon. 

**AJ Taylor:**
Brandon was working on it too. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
And Brandon. 

**AJ Taylor:**
Yeah, so I'll just put together. I don't think we have a rate sheet, but I'll put. I'll put something together and try to back into the cost. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
You can, you can use our current cost from an estimate standpoint on the sheet and just break that down. The time put in there, I don't know how long. Like it's just. Yeah, whatever hours that goes in. 

**AJ Taylor:**
I don't know if we can. Yeah, I'll get. I'll get them something and see if it works. At this point, it's four months. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Okay, thank you. AJ Glenn, Goodwill Foundations. 

**Glenn Ducharme:**
Goodwill got the subcontractor J and L on site today, right now as we speak, finishing up some of their paint touch ups, some adjusting doors. I was there earlier. Rachel had pointed out a handful of things that they were getting fixed today. Dean still has those. Warranty, defective warrant. Those defective lights out on warranty. Those will be shipping here a couple weeks on the 17th and he'll stop by and put those in. We were done otherwise. They did mention that the toilets and stuff were not very clean. They weren't clean to begin with. They're really staying. The cleaners did try to clean them. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Really? 

**Glenn Ducharme:**
Rachel didn't think that they did, so. See, I don't know what you want to do about that, Jesse, if you want to send the cleaners back to try again. I told him I'd also start working up an estimate to replace the six sinks, toilets and then the kitchen sink in the meantime. They're pretty stained and not able to come off. The car cleaners, Eric said he used the acid treatment on it and the toilets were smoking and it still didn't clean it off. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Okay, yeah. You got that comment from the meeting this morning? 

**Glenn Ducharme:**
Yeah, that's what it was about, the toilets. And when I went there today, Rachel asked if we had cleaned them and I said, yeah, they tried, but they wouldn't come off. She's like, they didn't clean them. They didn't even try, like. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
So I don't, I don't. 

**Glenn Ducharme:**
I'm gonna argue with her. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
But they, they did. 

**Glenn Ducharme:**
They got some of it clean. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
They just. Well, we don't want to piss Rachel off. So I would tell the cleaners to go back and try cleaning them again. Just go there with them and you can take some videos of it. Them trying to clean them or something. I don't know. Yeah, yeah. 

**Glenn Ducharme:**
Eric said he would. He was willing to go back again. So I talked to him on the way. Way back here, right before we jumped on her. That's what I was doing when I was late to our daily huddle today. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Are you saying she had issues with other things being clean? 

**Glenn Ducharme:**
It was the toilets and. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
A little. 

**Glenn Ducharme:**
Concrete wash that we did out front to eliminate the tripping hazard. It was supposed to be a temporary thing. I don't know if she thought it was going to be a. Like a resurface of the parking lot or something, but Andrew Molder's supposed to give me a call back because that's what him and I talked about doing. So I think we're good to go on that. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
I just need to. 

**Glenn Ducharme:**
I just need to hear from Andrew. But yes, I'll get Eric back out there to do another clean on those fixtures and see if they can be cleaned in the meantime while the plumbers are getting me a quote. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Okay. 

**Maria Calcetero:**

So as soon as we get that information, then we can finalize, you know, because they take temperature like all the different spaces in the warehouse. So it's going to make the job much easier than I was going to say initially thought. 

**AJ Taylor:**
So I didn't even know they had temp H VAC set up, so that's awesome that they've been doing that. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Well, yeah, they're spending. They have. They don't have power to run it, so they got generators running temp ac. It's costing them a fortune. So they're definitely going to pull the trigger. And once we get that information, we can size the, the systems appropriately. So it's going to help us. Yeah. 

**AJ Taylor:**
And I spoke with Ako last week and they said if we could just like bite off, and I know brandon told them 50k if we could just bite off 5 to 10 grand, they'll go and do some preliminary design, we'll actually know and then we can come up with, you know, whatever the most cost effective option is. Have to release them on the full. The full thing. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Yeah. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
I think they have 41,000 and designed for their H vac on that proposal. 

**AJ Taylor:**
In total, Jesse, for the H vac portion. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Okay. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
It's another 40 for the electrical. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
And what's like we met with them last week and like there's a big portion of this warehouse they don't really care about. And so it's just kind of hot spots where the people are working that we got to worry about. So it's really, it's going to be, I mean we definitely have a good number to make that work and be a good job. So just need to get that info from him. 

**AJ Taylor:**
Knowing him, we won't get it until a week from now. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Yeah. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Okay, perfect. Thank you guys. Building Edition. This is also you, aj. 

**AJ Taylor:**
Yeah, I know. Alex been working on making calls to guys trying to get some coverage for our drawings we sent out last week. And Brandon's just gotta work on pricing up that N2 system, the dry system, which I know is on his radar. That's what Mark is most worried about from my understanding. So once we can get all that pulled together, I'm thinking hopefully we'll be at a, just a better spot here at the end of the week and we can send something over to them we have all of our design pricing in just a matter of filling the gaps. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
And this one, I don't know if now's the time to relabel it but we're not adding on to a building anymore. We're building a a brand new 100,000 square foot warehouse. So at some point we need to change it. 

**AJ Taylor:**
I can change it Jesse. Update it and change it. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Thank you Adrian. Thank you Jesse. This is also Jesse or Alec for 40 West North Building that we're still. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
They'Re going to have the vote this September so and Jim just show that's a it's a two tower condo in Clearwater Beach. They got beat up by the hurricane and this is a project to rebuild both of the lobbies and common areas in each building and they just have to it's condo association has to we gave a proposal it was like $2 million or something like that and then the condo board needs to approve it and this is something that would start first of the year probably. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Thank you Jesse. Radial Godiva AJ. 

**AJ Taylor:**
Hopefully get some answers tomorrow. They're currently working through the lease negotiations or I guess the the contract with Godiva so figuring out if they're going to move them or not and if it makes sense. So we're kind of at a holding pattern still. Hopefully get some answers from JP tomorrow when we walk. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Thank you. AG GW Allison Road Retail Store Jesse. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
So both Allison Road and the Kokomo Andrew said today that they want to proceed with both projects and Goodwill board just needs to meet and vote on them. So we should find out in the near future about those two. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Thank you Jesse. Eye Surgeons OFFICE REMODEL agent. 

**AJ Taylor:**
Need to get budget pricing put together on that. So I know we're not doing design build anymore and I know Brandon said it's kind of on the back burner compared to Baggerstown which I don't see on here. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
One thing that Brandon did want to do AJ is we sent the we just kind of drew up I drew up some alternate plans for the based on our a meeting with you know the, the corridor how they show it and then. Right. A possible flip and we sent that to Christian and by Friday of this week he's going to have those drawn out for us as two options and then we can use those to budget like the difference between each option. 

**AJ Taylor:**
Yeah. Yeah. And so I don't think Maria, I don't think I wrote an update in there for this week. I missed that one. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
When I'm looking at it I'm Disappointed in you, aj. You're the only one who. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Not all of us took a four day weekend, aj. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Okay, perfect. And the last one, Sunnybright, TI Brandon and ej. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Yes. 

**AJ Taylor:**
So we're gonna try to get a design proposal to him into this week. Not try. We're going to get a design proposal to him end of this week. Oh, balls in my court to get that pulled together. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
But here it says already done for Brandon. By Brandon. 

**AJ Taylor:**
As far as. Well, that's sending invites out. That is done. Yes. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Makes sense. Okay. Okay guys, any other estimate projects that we need to add to. 

**AJ Taylor:**
Yes, we gotta add Baggerstown on there. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Oh, you have to spell that out for me. Baggers town. 

**AJ Taylor:**
Yep. B, A, G, G, E, R, S, T, O, W, N. Town. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Okay. And this is going to be 2509 02. 

**AJ Taylor:**
Let me look here. Baggerstown is. What number is Baggerstown, Alec? 

**Alec Wehner:**
I'm looking for right now. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
It is 25.08.26. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Perfect. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
So Jim, here's a. Here's a trivia question. Is Baggerstown an actual town in Indiana or the name of a potential business? 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock. 

**Jim Parker:**
I am definitely confused. Is that like a caddy? 

**Jesse Dawson:**
And Vaggerstown spelling is really off? 

**AJ Taylor:**
You said it's off. 

**Alec Wehner:**
Marie. That's actually B, not V. Oh, did. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
You just let me know, guys, that's. That's the one. 

**Alec Wehner:**
Yes. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
That's. 

**Alec Wehner:**
Yeah. 

**AJ Taylor:**
One word. But one word. 

**Alec Wehner:**
One word. Yeah. 

**AJ Taylor:**
Lowercase T. You can blame aj. I take full responsibility. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Okay, AJ So this is Indiana, right? 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Yep. 

**AJ Taylor:**
Noblesville, Indiana. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
And then this is gonna be Estimator. It's gonna be you. And then pm. 

**AJ Taylor:**
Me and Alec are working on it. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
So. 

**AJ Taylor:**
Okay, you put both of. Both of us down there and right now we're just working on making calls and getting coverage and. 

**Alec Wehner:**
Yep. 

**AJ Taylor:**
When did we. When did we set our. Our due date for the subs to get us pricing? 

**Alec Wehner:**
Due date for Baggerstown is September 8th. So it's next Monday. 

**AJ Taylor:**
Is that when our price is due or their price is due to us? 

**Alec Wehner:**
Their price is due to us. 

**AJ Taylor:**
Okay, so we got a day, right, to pull it together? 

**Alec Wehner:**
I believe so. Yes. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
That's what I thought. 

**AJ Taylor:**
Okay. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Yeah. 

**Alec Wehner:**
And then. And then it was Vermilion rise. It's the 12th, so that's why I've been making Bagger sound a little bit more my priority. But today I'm going back to Vermilion a bit. 

**AJ Taylor:**
Yep. 

**Alec Wehner:**
And just so everyone knows, so they don't think it's a crazy name. It's a cornhole facility so it should be a fun one. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Indoor cornhole tournament. 

**AJ Taylor:**
So now we're going to be able to add on our resume indoor volleyball and indoor cornhole. 

**Alec Wehner:**
I'm honestly kicking myself in the ass that didn't think of that idea. That is the best idea to ever heard of Indiana in so long. 

**AJ Taylor:**
Heck yeah. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
You can only play so much pickleball and you just get burnout, so. 

**Alec Wehner:**
Exactly. Yeah. Well, you can only fit cornhole boards in so many unfinished basements in Indiana, so. 

**AJ Taylor:**
Mm. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Perfect. 

**AJ Taylor:**

**Maria Calcetero:**
Yes. Any other. Any other projects? Now don't forget to please update these ones. Jim, welcome to the team. If you need anything, let us know. Jesse, any other comments from your side?
