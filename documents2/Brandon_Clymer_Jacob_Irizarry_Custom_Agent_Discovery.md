> Brandon's firm seeks to automate lead generation for their design-build services to improve efficiency and volume.

## Summary

Brandon's firm specializes in commercial design-build, focusing on warehouse infrastructure automation, currently relying on referrals and manual lead generation. Despite a remarkable 98% close rate when leads are introduced, the lead generation process is limited due to its manual nature. Brandon manages lead research via LinkedIn Sales Navigator and Apollo but seeks automation to enhance efficiency. An initial attempt to set up automation faced integration issues, particularly with Excel and Notion, prompting him to consider external solutions. The Lindy platform offers an AI-driven approach to automate tasks, with a focus on lead generation while allowing Brandon to manage outreach. Jacob showcased a research agent leveraging People Data Labs and Perplexity for enriched lead information. Two service pathways are available: self-serve or a partnership for custom agent development, with a pricing model consisting of three tiers and a recommendation for testing through a free Slack channel.
