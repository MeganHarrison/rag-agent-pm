## Transcript
**Jremillard**: Let's figure this out.
**Jremillard**: So what's going on with Microsoft?
**Jremillard**: It hates it.
**Jremillard**: I'm just kidding.
**Jremillard**: What happened?
**Speaker 1**: Oh, it really does hate me.
**Speaker 1**: It's typical of electronics.
**Speaker 1**: It isn't.
**Speaker 1**: It's.
**Speaker 1**: It takes me to that do the project part like the web based one, but it won't let me get into the.
**Speaker 1**: The downloadable one.
**Jremillard**: So can you try to.
**Jremillard**: Can you share your screen with me?
**Jremillard**: I want to see why you don't have the same view as me, as mine.
**Jremillard**: Because every time I log in I want to see if it's something because I yesterday I knew that I didn't give you the license, so I gave you the license and everything.
**Jremillard**: But I want to see the view because that's weird.
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: So also you're there.
**Jremillard**: Go to Sentinel Project.
**Jremillard**: Go to Microsoft.
**Jremillard**: If you're not already install from the Microsoft 365 homepage.
**Jremillard**: Select Install and more Project Standard and Professional Project.
**Jremillard**: Yours is Professional.
**Jremillard**: Correct, but yours is Project Install anymore.
**Jremillard**: Install Microsoft 365 apps.
**Jremillard**: If you see.
**Jremillard**: Let me try it on my end here.
**Jremillard**: One second.
**Jremillard**: So I'm here on Microsoft 365 and then I'm here.
**Jremillard**: Let me see.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, this is the page it takes me to.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, that says I should click on Download or whatever.
**Jremillard**: So you see what it is.
**Jremillard**: The three dots next to Jesse Ramire next to your name like to be.
**Jremillard**: Click there, please down.
**Jremillard**: Download the mobile app.
**Jremillard**: Let me see what happened.
**Jremillard**: Can you click on it, please?
**Jremillard**: How about.
**Jremillard**: This is going to be.
**Jremillard**: Oh, but this is Copilot.
**Jremillard**: No, but this is going to be for your.
**Jremillard**: For your phone.
**Speaker 1**: So yeah, that'll just put it on my phone.
**Jremillard**: But if we download Copilot, probably you'll get access to it because you see that it says get the Microsoft 365 copilot model up.
**Jremillard**: So I think what we need to download is a Copilot application to your laptop and then from Copilot we can use it.
**Jremillard**: So I have Copilot here.
**Jremillard**: Let me check one second.
**Jremillard**: If I can use it right here.
**Jremillard**: But you have it online, correct?
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, it's like what I'm trying to get is.
**Speaker 1**: See, you know how it's just like on the desktop.
**Speaker 1**: Word and.
**Speaker 1**: Yes, yeah, just trying to get that.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, one second.
**Jremillard**: So I'm here at Copilot, but let me see if.
**Jremillard**: And then I'm going to.
**Speaker 1**: Because this is when I click on that Microsoft Planner, this is what it takes me to.
**Jremillard**: This is.
**Jremillard**: I only see Copilot.
**Jremillard**: That's the same place From Copilot.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, because here, where is that?
**Speaker 1**: Like, here is where I click in Planner, Microsoft Planner, and this link is like dead Install Project.
**Jremillard**: When you click on it, nothing happened.
**Speaker 1**: Nothing happens.
**Speaker 1**: It says, you should see this thing, do something, but it doesn't.
**Jremillard**: What if you change the version from 64 to.
**Jremillard**: Let's try to change the version of the 64 bit.
**Jremillard**: Change it to another one.
**Speaker 1**: It's the only one you can get is the older one for 32 bit.
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: So probably that's what.
**Jremillard**: Because I don't, I don't have it on my lap because my account.
**Jremillard**: Apps and devices.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: It's so strange the way they have you do it now.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, but it should work.
**Jremillard**: That's why.
**Jremillard**: So random.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: And that's why.
**Speaker 1**: I didn't know.
**Speaker 1**: Maybe there's a permission I need.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, no, and actually I checked.
**Jremillard**: I checked your license and I was like, oh, my God, I didn't add it.
**Jremillard**: And I gave you.
**Jremillard**: I was like, that was my fault.
**Jremillard**: You can blame me.
**Jremillard**: But then I was like, I gave you everything.
**Jremillard**: You know, like the, the, the, the.
**Jremillard**: You know, the access.
**Jremillard**: So you.
**Jremillard**: Once you have the access, you should be able just to download it.
**Jremillard**: So.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, because I remember when my laptop showed up, I asked you and you sent me that link and I clicked on it and everything was fine.
**Speaker 1**: But I, I didn't go as far as putting the desktop one on here.
**Speaker 1**: And I've tried to search it in the start menu and it's not in there.
**Jremillard**: Let me see something.
**Jremillard**: So it's here.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, but I have the same as you.
**Jremillard**: I'm trying to download the 64, but it's.
**Jremillard**: You're right, the.
**Jremillard**: The link is dead because I don't have it on my desktop either.
**Jremillard**: You know, I don't.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, yeah, you'd have no reason to use that program.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, but I have.
**Jremillard**: I'm trying to go where you go to your account, and I'm hearing the same as Office and Project, but it doesn't.
**Jremillard**: Let me.
**Jremillard**: One second, let me try this.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, because if, if more people are getting hired, they're probably all going to need this.
**Jremillard**: If not, we can always send them a ticket.
**Jremillard**: You know, I always can send them like, I'm trying to download it.
**Jremillard**: It's not working, so I need you to.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, we actually have it.
**Jremillard**: Yes, we do.
**Jremillard**: I mean, I can connect us to that.
**Jremillard**: So can you actually.
**Jremillard**: Let's compare the Project.
**Jremillard**: Microsoft here.
**Jremillard**: It's.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, no, I want to send them a ticket because I cannot download it either.
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: So, yeah, you should click on it.
**Jremillard**: That's the thing.
**Jremillard**: So Office.
**Jremillard**: You are okay with office and everything is working except that project link?
**Speaker 1**: Yep.
**Speaker 1**: Everything else seems to be working fine.
**Speaker 1**: Just not project.
**Jremillard**: Okay, let me send them a ticket and ask them why your specific license?
**Jremillard**: Because I have your license number.
**Jremillard**: We need them to download the desktop version and the link that, you know, it sent us to install it.
**Jremillard**: It's not working.
**Jremillard**: So maybe they can provide us another link or something.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, they should be able to do something.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: So let me log in right now to our IT part.
**Jremillard**: Okay, I'll do this right now.
**Jremillard**: One second.
**Jremillard**: Let me see what is my IT people here support.
**Jremillard**: Okay, I'll keep you posted.
**Jremillard**: And usually what I do is just I cc you in every communication because they like to call, so they prefer to call me.
**Jremillard**: So when I call, sometimes I ask you guys to jump to the call because they have questions and specific stuff.
**Jremillard**: But I'll cc you on this email right now that I'm writing for them, and then I'll keep you posted.
