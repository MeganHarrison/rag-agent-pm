## Transcript
**Cfarmer**: How are we doing, guys?
**Mkelley**: Morning.
**Jdickson**: Morning.
**Cfarmer**: Jose, is Charles gonna be joining?
**Mkelley**: I don't know.
**Mkelley**: He said he's got another meeting, should probably be here, and then later.
**Mkelley**: So I don't know if he's going to be joining us or not, but I.
**Mkelley**: I think I can answer most of the questions that you may have.
**Cfarmer**: Okay.
**Cfarmer**: So I got Matt here.
**Cfarmer**: He's.
**Cfarmer**: He's gonna be our roofer.
**Mkelley**: Okay.
**Cfarmer**: And so I just wanted to.
**Cfarmer**: To do a quick little coordination call.
**Cfarmer**: So you guys have already ordered the ductwork and the cur.
**Cfarmer**: Jose?
**Mkelley**: Yes.
**Cfarmer**: Do we have an estimated time on when that's going to come in?
**Mkelley**: They say the fact fabrication say this should be ready about 10 days.
**Mkelley**: So that put us around the week of the 16th.
**Cfarmer**: The week of the 16th, yes.
**Cfarmer**: Okay, so explain this to me, Jose.
**Cfarmer**: And this is for you, Matt.
**Cfarmer**: So, so what we're going to do is, Matt, we're going to get a crane, we're going to lift these old RTUs up and then, Jose, are we going to tear out the old curve or are we going to be putting just adapters on top of the existing curve?
**Mkelley**: Correct.
**Mkelley**: Yes.
**Mkelley**: So we are lifting the unit and squeezing the new adapter to make the unit size charge.
**Cfarmer**: Okay.
**Cfarmer**: And we will not have to re.
**Cfarmer**: Roof around the.
**Cfarmer**: These units, correct?
**Mkelley**: No, no, though.
**Mkelley**: No.
**Mkelley**: We will need the roofer to do little penetrations for the block work to go into the building in the new locations.
**Cfarmer**: And how many penetrations?
**Mkelley**: We're talking about four.
**Mkelley**: So we need supply return for each unit.
**Mkelley**: And we got two units.
**Mkelley**: Those curves will be.
**Mkelley**: I think, I believe it.
**Mkelley**: Let me just go back to the size, but I believe they're 50 by 30.
**Mkelley**: So they're little curves and I think they're.
**Mkelley**: They're going to be 14 inch tall.
**Cfarmer**: So.
**Cfarmer**: So Matt, did you, did you catch that?
**Cfarmer**: 14 inch tall curves and they're going to be 50 inches by 30 inches.
**Cfarmer**: And we have four of them, Jose.
**Mkelley**: Right.
**Jdickson**: Okay.
**Jdickson**: And then are those curves, are they going to be provided or is this.
**Mkelley**: Something that we got.
**Jdickson**: We got everything.
**Jdickson**: Okay.
**Alvarezinc2013**: Yeah.
**Mkelley**: They're being copy fitted at the same time, though.
**Mkelley**: They're with the same supplier.
**Jdickson**: Okay.
**Jdickson**: And along with those curves, are you gonna need like a.
**Jdickson**: Any pitch pans for service lines or anything that are going with the new units?
**Mkelley**: I don't know how the electrician is going to run the power to the new unit.
**Mkelley**: I think they're just going to extend it out.
**Mkelley**: Right, A.J.
**Cfarmer**: Jose.
**Cfarmer**: I would.
**Cfarmer**: I thought.
**Cfarmer**: And I'll get with Charles.
**Cfarmer**: I thought you guys had disconnecting and reconnecting on there.
**Cfarmer**: But I need to get electrician involved.
**Cfarmer**: If not.
**Cfarmer**: I didn't, I didn't.
**Cfarmer**: I didn't have that covered.
**Mkelley**: Okay, well, I'm assuming it's going to be pretty simple.
**Mkelley**: And we will need any more hitch pans because the power is already there at the curve.
**Mkelley**: So basically we just got to add maybe a box and then extend a new wire because it's going to extend like 36 inches higher.
**Mkelley**: So the existing wire will reach the control panel, the electrical panel.
**Mkelley**: So we may have to add like a little box, but that can be mounted on the.
**Mkelley**: On the same curve adapter that we installed.
**Jdickson**: Okay.
**Mkelley**: Yeah.
**Cfarmer**: Awesome.
**Cfarmer**: So who.
**Cfarmer**: I would have to go back and look at your quote, Jose, but I mean, obviously someone's got to cut the roof.
**Cfarmer**: So that'll be you, right, Matt?
**Jdickson**: So, yeah, so we'll cut the roof down to the deck and then allow them to run their deck work through the metal.
**Cfarmer**: Okay, so Jose, you'll cut the deck though, correct?
**Mkelley**: Yes.
**Cfarmer**: Awesome.
**Cfarmer**: So Matt, if you can get me a price for that and we can start locking that in and I can.
**Cfarmer**: I can issue a subcontract.
**Cfarmer**: It's a really basic one.
**Mkelley**: It.
**Cfarmer**: And then from there we just need to start gearing up for doing this the week of the 16th.
**Cfarmer**: Okay, guys?
**Mkelley**: Okay.
**Cfarmer**: Matt, is that possible for you?
**Jdickson**: Yeah, no, that shouldn't be an issue.
**Jdickson**: I'll go ahead and put that in the air of our service department just so they are aware of it and then.
**Jdickson**: Yeah, just.
**Jdickson**: Yeah, that shouldn't be an issue getting out there the 16th.
**Cfarmer**: And Jose, are you expecting like, what's your timeline for how long this is going to take?
**Mkelley**: I'm expecting at least a couple days on the roof.
**Mkelley**: The.
**Mkelley**: The first day is going to be pretty much just moving the unit and squeezing the new adapter.
**Mkelley**: And then we gotta do the.
**Mkelley**: The penetration, those curves and then we gotta extend maybe a day or two doing the duck work.
**Mkelley**: And then we gotta go back downstairs and install the four ways that you say that you got on the shelf.
**Cfarmer**: Okay, we're gonna have.
**Mkelley**: Go ahead.
**Cfarmer**: Yeah.
**Cfarmer**: And I just wanted to see.
**Cfarmer**: Do you guys have like a drawing?
**Cfarmer**: Can you mark up a drawing and show where we're gonna.
**Cfarmer**: Where we're going to be putting these?
**Cfarmer**: I mean.
**Mkelley**: Yeah, I think we can, we can do that if no charge.
**Mkelley**: Did you did that some kind of drawing?
**Alvarezinc2013**: Charge it.
**Alvarezinc2013**: Yeah, no, I haven't.
**Alvarezinc2013**: I haven't done a drawing yet.
**Alvarezinc2013**: I mean, a site visit would be good, but I Can.
**Alvarezinc2013**: We can work something up just to kind of get, you know, a clear picture as to the area, what side of the unit, the.
**Alvarezinc2013**: The ductwork's going to go on and everything.
**Alvarezinc2013**: But as far as exact location, it might require just a site visit so we know exactly where everything's going.
**Cfarmer**: Yeah, And I just want to mark it up.
**Cfarmer**: I'm meeting with Kelly tomorrow morning, Charles.
**Cfarmer**: And that's why I wanted to do this, so we can get it locked in.
**Cfarmer**: So right now.
**Cfarmer**: And my little Fireflies note taker will send out notes, Charles, on what you missed.
**Cfarmer**: But.
**Cfarmer**: Okay, week of the 16th is what we're gearing up for.
**Cfarmer**: I got Matt here.
**Cfarmer**: He's our roofer.
**Cfarmer**: He's on board, so we just need to coordinate with him.
**Cfarmer**: We got four openings in the roof that we're doing.
**Cfarmer**: I'm assuming, like, that's one supply and one return for each one, Correct?
**Alvarezinc2013**: Correct.
**Cfarmer**: And then we're going to locate those on a joist.
**Cfarmer**: That way, no structural is going to be needed and we should be good to go.
**Cfarmer**: It's as easy as that.
**Cfarmer**: So, Charles, let me know when we can get that crane locked in, and that'll we'll be able to kind of center everything around that.
**Cfarmer**: But I'm going to let her know we're working on it.
**Cfarmer**: Probably be maybe later in the week, but.
**Alvarezinc2013**: Yes, sir.
**Cfarmer**: Week of the 16th or something.
**Cfarmer**: Okay?
**Alvarezinc2013**: Yes, sir.
**Alvarezinc2013**: Hey.
**Alvarezinc2013**: Yes, sir.
**Jdickson**: A.J.
**Jdickson**: i just had a quick question.
**Cfarmer**: Yeah.
**Jdickson**: So when we get there, is this going to be something that we can do our part all in one day, or is it going to be you're set in one unit and running the ductwork for one?
**Mkelley**: I think we can get done with your part in one day.
**Jdickson**: Okay.
**Mkelley**: Yeah, so we'll.
**Alvarezinc2013**: So we'll.
**Cfarmer**: We'll make sure that we get the roof cut for them.
**Cfarmer**: They'll cut.
**Cfarmer**: They'll install their curb, and then you can flash those in, Matt.
**Cfarmer**: And that way you just have one mob.
**Jdickson**: Okay, Perfect.
**Mkelley**: On site.
**Mkelley**: If he needs to get anything on the roof, like a generator or something like that, we will have a skytrack inside.
**Jdickson**: Okay.
**Alvarezinc2013**: You.
**Jdickson**: You'll have a.
**Jdickson**: We shouldn't.
**Jdickson**: We shouldn't need it.
**Cfarmer**: But.
**Jdickson**: Okay.
**Jdickson**: But there will be a sky check on site just in case.
**Cfarmer**: Okay, Charles, one thing that we had mentioned for me and Jose had talked about electrical.
**Cfarmer**: I.
**Cfarmer**: I thought I saw in your quote you had disconnecting and reconnecting those units.
**Cfarmer**: Is that something you have, or do I need to get an electrician on that?
**Alvarezinc2013**: Well, Ulta's got Their own in house electricians.
**Alvarezinc2013**: That's something I spoke to Kelly about.
**Alvarezinc2013**: So anything that needs to be done, any electrical that needs to be extended or whatnot, they're going to take care of that in house.
**Alvarezinc2013**: We're going to go disconnect it, you know, and make sure the units, you know, ready for the lift.
**Alvarezinc2013**: But as far as anything that needs to be added or extended to get the units back and running on the electrical side, Ulta is going to take care of that.
**Alvarezinc2013**: We're going to handle the gas lines and the controls.
**Cfarmer**: Perfect.
**Cfarmer**: Yeah, I'll get with Kelly because she may just.
**Cfarmer**: I have electricians on site with that, with the retrofit project that you helped me out on for that demo.
**Cfarmer**: So she may just have my guys do that.
**Cfarmer**: So I'll.
**Cfarmer**: I'll get with her, see what she wants to do.
**Alvarezinc2013**: Okay.
**Alvarezinc2013**: All right.
**Alvarezinc2013**: That sounds good.
**Alvarezinc2013**: That sounds good.
**Alvarezinc2013**: So shooting for the week of the 16th, you said, or the 14th.
**Mkelley**: Okay.
**Jdickson**: All right.
**Cfarmer**: And we just need.
**Cfarmer**: Yeah, let's just lock in some dates because I'd like to.
**Cfarmer**: I need to fly out there anyway.
**Cfarmer**: You know, right now I don't have many guys on site, so me and my superintendent haven't really been around, but one of us will go out there.
**Cfarmer**: I always.
**Alvarezinc2013**: Okay.
**Cfarmer**: I always like seeing Crane.
