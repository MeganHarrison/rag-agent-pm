**Speaker 5**: Some of the other so far.
**Speaker 5**: That's the one that I see that has been synced today.

**Fnjie**: If you can be specific to which jobs have not been done yet.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: So they'll see their job show up.
**Speaker 5**: And for the PF that is due this week, I think we still need to wait for the payment.
**Speaker 5**: If you will be receiving collection for this week since.
**Speaker 5**: Yeah, I've updated the cash flow as of the balances of the bank yesterday.
**Speaker 5**: It's in the notion if you'll check.
**Speaker 5**: So I haven't processed yet any check.
**Speaker 5**: I'll just wait.
**Speaker 5**: If we have collection that is going to our bank this week.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: We.
**Jdawson**: I mean we should have been told we're going to.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Speaker 5**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I mean we've got.
**Jdawson**: And we've got what.
**Jdawson**: What changed on our cash flow from last week?
**Jdawson**: Because.
**Jdawson**: Because before last week with our accounts receivable unreleased retainage and then AP aging balance, we had like a positive 2.2 million.
**Jdawson**: Now it's just 11 million.
**Speaker 5**: We have posted some subcon pay up.
**Speaker 5**: That is Zhu on August.
**Speaker 5**: July invoices.
**Speaker 5**: Yeah, gotcha.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so that AP aging is inclusive of stuff that is going to be due in August.
**Jdawson**: And we don't have any owner billings, you know, included in that for August.
**Jdawson**: Correct.
**Speaker 5**: For the AP aging, it includes July and August.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: But what I'm saying is that 4.6 million receivables number does not any.
**Jdawson**: Any owner pay apps from July which would then be due in August.
**Jdawson**: Correct?
**Speaker 5**: Yeah, yeah, let's till June.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So that's why that's skewing.
**Jdawson**: So that should update here in the next week.
**Speaker 5**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: The next.
**Bclymer**: So we have akumatica any pending transactions which is a lace.
**Bclymer**: Am I ECHOING yeah, I think Francine.
**Accounting**: Needs to mute herself.
**Bclymer**: Fritzi is muted okay, I just.
**Bclymer**: Good.
**Bclymer**: So Akumatica independent transaction actions, issues or delays.
**Bclymer**: Did we fix.
**Bclymer**: I think it was something to fix on Akumatica.
**Bclymer**: Jose.
**Bclymer**: Did we finish it?
**Jmendez**: That is the item number five.
**Jmendez**: Sorry, I was looking at the number four because the payroll.
**Jmendez**: But do you mean the number five, right?
**Bclymer**: Oh, yes, you're right.
**Bclymer**: I'm sorry.
**Bclymer**: So, yeah, we can move to number five and then I'll go back to number four.
**Bclymer**: So you.
**Bclymer**: If you want to go, you can go.
**Jmendez**: Yeah.
**Jmendez**: No, in Akumatica we are.
**Jmendez**: We have no transaction pending, but the payroll are still pending to be upload.
**Jmendez**: But we need previously the okay for the coded payroll and the payroll are coded.
**Jmendez**: So for July 18th and waiting for the next August 1st that is coming this week.
**Jmendez**: But no transaction pending to be uploaded in acumatica at this time.
**Accounting**: Do we have the approvals and all the allocations are posted?
**Jmendez**: No, for the last two payroll, but we will.
**Jmendez**: We will look for that with Jesse.
**Jmendez**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.

**Accounting**: So whenever you get a chance, approved the payroll for us to load.
**Fnjie**: Is that the.
**Fnjie**: The out of town or do you.
**Fnjie**: Am I approving the.
**Fnjie**: Like, the whole sheet?
**Accounting**: The whole sheet?
**Accounting**: The whole sheet.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: And that's.
**Fnjie**: I received two different emails.
**Fnjie**: Is it both of them or just the one for this current pay period?
**Accounting**: It's both of them.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Accounting**: And we'll be sending those out.
**Accounting**: We'll be sending those out every time for each pay period.
**Accounting**: When we have the allocation done, we'll just.
**Accounting**: Just send it your way for an, you know, an additional approval just to make sure everything looks correct before we charge.
**Accounting**: Charge them to the jobs.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: Now, like Brandon was saying last time, and I thought we were going to put like, people's names next to these different items as to who's responsible for that particular thing.
**Fnjie**: That would help me out.
**Fnjie**: I don't know.
**Fnjie**: Maria, do you send this out, like after the meeting?
**Fnjie**: Like, here's an update, the things we're working on next week.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, we can send it out just if you want to.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, but we can do it because.
**Bclymer**: And you said by name too, so we can add a name to it.
**Bclymer**: So it's easy for you as well to track it.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Fnjie**: Yeah, because like status of payroll processing.
**Fnjie**: Is that all on me or is it two.
**Fnjie**: Something below that I need to approve it and then.
**Bclymer**: Oh, yeah.
**Bclymer**: So for that.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And actually the order is Fritzi doing timesheets.
**Bclymer**: Timesheet Sent to Jesse.
**Bclymer**: Jesse, approved time, sorry the podiums and everything.
**Bclymer**: And then Maria sent to venture.
**Bclymer**: So that's the cycle.
**Bclymer**: So I'll fix it.
**Bclymer**: Don't worry.
**Bclymer**: I'll make sure you know and talking about that, don't forget the timesheets so we can have them ready for tomorrow, Wednesday so we can do payroll this week.
**Bclymer**: Everything was fixed yesterday.
**Bclymer**: Our payroll was also fixed since he's a remote person.
**Bclymer**: But yeah, we just need to send it out today and then that's just.
**Accounting**: One side of the payroll on the accountant side.
**Accounting**: Once we list out all the allocations, Jose will send you the approval.
**Accounting**: Jesse.
**Accounting**: So you can see the job coding.
**Accounting**: Approve everything before we post it to acumatica and job planner.
**Bclymer**: So basically it's all on you, Jesse.
**Bclymer**: Just kidding.
**Bclymer**: We're depending on you.
**Bclymer**: So I'll say.
**Bclymer**: But yeah, but I'll send it to you so you can approve that on time.
**Accounting**: For payroll.
**Accounting**: I do have have a question.
**Accounting**: I was was thinking about setting a deadline of like Tuesday by end of day on a payroll week to have all the timesheets.
**Accounting**: All the timesheets like submitted because it's due to venture on Wednesday, right?
**Accounting**: Wednesday or Thursday?
**Bclymer**: Wednesday.
**Accounting**: Wednesday.
**Accounting**: So can we have all the guys enter their timesheets by end of the day on Tuesday?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that should be reasonable.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So Fritzi, can you.
**Bclymer**: You are the person nudging them, right?
**Bclymer**: On the timesheets, especially Jack.
**Bclymer**: And yes, if you can please make sure they are doing that before Wednesday.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Accounting**: We need to add that to the calendar also.
**Accounting**: Maria.
**Accounting**: So by the end of the day all the timesheets are due by end of the day Tuesday on a payroll week.
**Accounting**: Every two weeks.
**Jdawson**: I would say midday on Tuesday because you have to give time for us to confirm them.
**Bclymer**: Okay, but that's for everybody.
**Bclymer**: The timesheets or usually it's.
**Bclymer**: No.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, everybody has to update their timesheets.
**Bclymer**: Correct.
**Bclymer**: The only people that are asking you for per DMS is always Jack and who else?
**Bclymer**: Nick, Pretty.
**Fnjie**: Mike.
**Bclymer**: Mike.
**Bclymer**: But okay, okay, I'll set up the calendar for everybody.
**Fnjie**: So that is a calendar.
**Fnjie**: That's something out of job or teams that'll send a notice out of every other Tuesday.
**Bclymer**: Yes, correct.
**Bclymer**: Every other Tuesday they will have like a calendar notification saying that they have to finish their timesheets before midday on Tuesday.
**Bclymer**: But I'll send it after the meeting because I have to set it up.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Something else for payroll guys?
**Bclymer**: No.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Akumatica already.
**Bclymer**: Jose went through that one notion.
**Bclymer**: Credit card transactions.
**Bclymer**: Jose.
**Bclymer**: So you sent that out this Morning.
**Jmendez**: Yeah.
**Jmendez**: In Notion we are uploading it on a weekly basis.
**Jmendez**: The credit card transaction for coding.
**Jmendez**: And then this week we have sending this email notifying the.
**Jmendez**: The.
**Jmendez**: The guys.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So one thing I'd like to see on that is like it.
**Jdawson**: We should see like, you know, credit card transactions synced through blank.
**Jdawson**: So like, you know, whatever date they're synced through.
**Jdawson**: So it's like synced through May or June or whatever that is.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: Windu.
**Accounting**: And how.
**Accounting**: How far have we gotten with the approvals out of notion.
**Accounting**: Do we still have a lot uncoded?
**Jdawson**: It doesn't look like it.
**Jdawson**: I mean, I'm looking in here right now, it looks like we've got, you.
**Fnjie**: Know.
**Jdawson**: Less than 100.
**Jmendez**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And I think those are all.
**Jdawson**: I mean these are all very recent.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: These are all from.
**Jdawson**: These are all from early July, you know, early to mid July.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Accounting**: So we have all of June done.
**Accounting**: Jose.
**Jmendez**: Almost.
**Jmendez**: Because I have still someone.
**Jmendez**: Let me see one second.
**Jmendez**: Oh, yeah.
**Jmendez**: All June we have approved.
**Jmendez**: So we worked on uploading to Qematica, preparing the data.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Random question.
**Bclymer**: Sorry.
**Bclymer**: Did Jess, from your GV.
**Fnjie**: Of all these credit card transactions.
**Fnjie**: There's none sitting in my court.
**Jdawson**: Correct.
**Jdawson**: If you go to the leadership dashboard, you click on coded, you know, like right here.
**Jdawson**: So here's what the dashboard looks like.
**Jdawson**: So we got nothing in our court.
**Jdawson**: You know, a handful of stuff that needs to be coded up here.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Brandon, quick question.
**Bclymer**: Did JCR give you Alex credit card?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, he did.
**Jdawson**: I don't know.
**Jdawson**: I guess.
**Jdawson**: I don't really know why I. I guess it makes sense now because I thought he was going down to St. Pete this week and he wasn't, so that makes more sense.
**Jdawson**: So, yeah, we'll just.
**Jdawson**: We'll have to that exit down there.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: Yeah.
**Fnjie**: I don't know what's going on with the mail, but they're not delivering anything to us.
**Fnjie**: Now.
**Fnjie**: It's possible we haven't had any mail, but KE or Alex going to go down to the post office and see what's going on.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so we need to send it out.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, because he's concerned about that.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Anyway, so I'll talk to you later about it so we can send it to Alec.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: What else?
**Jdawson**: What's he even.
**Jdawson**: I mean, he hasn't even spent anything on it.
**Jdawson**: Like what would he need to spend anything on?
**Bclymer**: No, he just wanted to see his credit card and I told him that you have it because I was a.
**Bclymer**: We agreed the agreement was that Jesse Art was going to give it to you because you were going to Florida.
**Bclymer**: If I wasn't wrong.
**Bclymer**: If I'm not wrong.
**Jdawson**: But now I gotta stay up here for the grand opening of bart.
**Bclymer**: Exactly.
**Bclymer**: So are you going to there, Jesse?
**Fnjie**: I'll be there Monday night.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, we can do that or we can FedEx.
**Bclymer**: Whatever you guys prefer.
**Jdawson**: Well, I mean.
**Jdawson**: I mean, he shouldn't.
**Jdawson**: I don't.
**Jdawson**: I mean, he doesn't travel, you know, he.
**Jdawson**: So he's.
**Jdawson**: You know, it's not like his get.
**Jdawson**: He's.
**Jdawson**: None of his gas should be on there because he's going to and from the office.
**Jdawson**: So it's not like he has any cost.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, it's okay.
**Bclymer**: I'll talk to him.
**Bclymer**: But yeah, okay.
**Bclymer**: I'm glad you still have it.
**Bclymer**: That's.
**Bclymer**: That was the question.
**Bclymer**: Just to make sure you have the car with you.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And last question to you guys.
**Bclymer**: So Fatima Fritzijo says something important Jesse and Brandon needs to sign check that you guys are pending.
**Accounting**: No, not on my end.
**Jdawson**: No.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jmendez**: No, Maria.
**Bclymer**: Okay, perfect.
**Bclymer**: And then I'm gonna send the reminders for you guys before every weekly meeting.
**Bclymer**: So you guys can send the documents to Jesse and Brandon and then they can revise them before the meeting.
**Bclymer**: And I'll set up the calendar for the timesheets for.
**Jdawson**: Just so we're on the same page on what this should look like.
**Jdawson**: This should be.
**Jdawson**: Here's the agenda in the supporting documents all in one file.
**Jdawson**: That way Jesse and I can open it.
**Jdawson**: I don't want seven different things.
**Jdawson**: And we're sorting through it all.
**Jdawson**: It should be put together and sent, you know, ideally a day before and we can look at it.
**Jdawson**: And then that way we can have any questions and, you know, come into the meeting and ask the questions and knock it out.
**Bclymer**: Okay, sounds good.
**Fnjie**: Glenn made a comment that he still doesn't have cost hitting his job.
**Fnjie**: The Westfield is that is all labor that's been coded there.
**Fnjie**: Other than the last couple of weeks and all credit card transactions, is there anything that wouldn't be hitting that job as of now or showing up in job planner?
**Accounting**: We had to make a correction in May because the pay date was June.
**Accounting**: So the team was getting ready to upload it to June, but I told them to upload it to May because that's May payroll.
**Accounting**: That's May labor cost.
**Accounting**: Jose, is that uploaded?
**Jmendez**: Do you mean May?
**Accounting**: Yeah, the one that was.
**Accounting**: I think the pay date was May 6, but the payroll dates are actually in May.
**Accounting**: Is that one uploaded or is that one of the ones you're waiting for approval on.
**Jmendez**: Is uploaded.
**Accounting**: It's uploaded.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah.
**Accounting**: So he should see it now.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I'd be, I'd be curious to know what he's saying isn't hitting because I'm looking here and you know there's $35,000 to date in PM costs, $25,000 a day in super cost, 12,000 to date in project engine.
**Jdawson**: So I guess if I'm, if I'm looking at this.
**Fnjie**: It'S up through five.
**Fnjie**: It's only up through five.
**Fnjie**: Three.
**Fnjie**: There's one for 517.
**Jdawson**: I mean this is.
**Jdawson**: I see 617, 523, two of them.
**Jdawson**: 6 17, 6 11.
**Fnjie**: Look to the right, Brandon.
**Fnjie**: See where it says the description?
**Fnjie**: So 5:17 is the last time that they had labor hit that job.
**Fnjie**: So that is two months behind, basically.
**Fnjie**: And then you go from February, March, April, May.
**Jdawson**: Have we uploaded the ones from.
**Jdawson**: See, I guess it would be, you know, from the, the last week and two week, last three periods of May.
**Jdawson**: And then I would think that all of June should be in there as well.
**Accounting**: All of June is what we're waiting for approval on to post.
**Accounting**: But last week of May, last week in May should have been posted.
**Accounting**: Jose, can you double check that?
**Jmendez**: Yeah, okay, I will, I will take it.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Fnjie**: And is that something, I mean, I'm typically used to this being two weeks behind, but not longer than that.
**Fnjie**: What is the.
**Fnjie**: Educate me, I guess on the process of when the payroll's approved, payrolls paid, what does it take for that to get put on the job?
**Accounting**: The payroll is approved, it's paid.
**Accounting**: The team just needs to allocate the payroll to the proper jobs.
**Accounting**: We send you that, you approve it, we post it in acumatica and it gets synced into Job Planner.
**Accounting**: So if you want us to skip the approval process, we can also.
**Jdawson**: So what's the, what is the time frame?
**Jdawson**: If everybody was on top of their stuff, that that can be done and posted to a job.
**Accounting**: It can be done within a few.
**Jdawson**: Days of payroll being being taken out of our account.
**Accounting**: Yes.
**Accounting**: It can be done by the next Friday.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so then we need to, we need to say that.
**Jdawson**: Okay, you know, at the very latest, two weeks after payroll runs, those costs need to be in Job Planner.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Jmendez**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So, you know, set a calendar reminder or whatever it is you got to do.
**Jdawson**: You know, let's, let's get that done.
**Fnjie**: It's just, I know as a PM when I was forecasting, end of the month comes up, it's just a lot easier.
**Fnjie**: You know, you got two weeks out there of whatever, and you can get pretty accurate.
**Fnjie**: But when you got a couple months of labor and, you know, some of these jobs, you know, they vary with different people's time that gets charged to them.
**Fnjie**: So it can add up to quite a bit.
**Accounting**: We'll make sure to get it caught up.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: If there is nothing else, guys, that's good to go.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: Thank you.
