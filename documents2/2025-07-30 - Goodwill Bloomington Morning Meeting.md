**Jcurtin**: Just, you know, about the time you finish this, I think that job is probably about to start.
**Jcurtin**: It's a.
**Jcurtin**: Another sprinkler project up in.
**Jcurtin**: I think it's New Jersey.
**Jcurtin**: I know, but Alec is running it, so probably looking maybe going there.

**Ksipe**: Yeah.
**Ksipe**: Yeah.
**Ksipe**: I appreciate it.
**Ksipe**: How's.
**Ksipe**: I think.
**Ksipe**: What else?
**Ksipe**: We talked with maybe an Excel center up in Indianapolis.
**Ksipe**: Is that one still in the works?
**Ksipe**: Could that still be a possibility, too?
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, it just depends how quick Nick can get the design back from the owner.
**Jcurtin**: We can get the design started.
**Jcurtin**: That'll take a couple months probably, to get permitted.
**Ksipe**: Right on.
**Ksipe**: Yeah.
**Ksipe**: True, true.
**Ksipe**: Definitely not any.
**Ksipe**: Probably not anything turned around quick enough, like end of August or something.
**Ksipe**: Okay.
**Ksipe**: So, yeah, no, I appreciate you letting me know that Pennsylvania got you.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: You know, are you able to get the location that you and Griffin wanted to put the donation Dropbox check?
**Ksipe**: Yeah, it's on the right side of the door.
**Jdawson**: Dude, do you have a dimension you could get from there that.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, he wanted it.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I just want to make sure Andrew's okay with that.
**Ksipe**: Gotcha.
**Ksipe**: Yeah, Andrew actually sent me the dimension of it.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I'm just thinking the dimension off the door.
**Ksipe**: Oh, yeah.
**Ksipe**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Do you need any answers on anything, Jack?
**Ksipe**: No, not at the moment.
**Ksipe**: No, not at the moment.
**Ksipe**: If anything comes to mind, I'll let you know.
**Ksipe**: Hey, Jesse, is that.
**Ksipe**: Is that the sprinkler in Pennsylvania?
**Ksipe**: Is that Burnville 2.0, or is that a whole new one?
**Jcurtin**: I'm sorry, what was.
**Ksipe**: Did Burnville have a part two to it?
**Ksipe**: Was it the Burn.
**Ksipe**: Is it that Burnville location or.
