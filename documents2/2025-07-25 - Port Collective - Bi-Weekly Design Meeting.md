## Transcript
**Jbriscella**: Hello.
**Pkumari**: Hey, Justin.
**Jbriscella**: How are you?
**Pkumari**: Pretty good.
**Pkumari**: How about yourself?
**Jbriscella**: Good, good.
**Jbriscella**: Doing well.
**Tgreen**: Thank you.
**Pkumari**: Yeah, sorry it's been a little bit of a hectic Friday.
**Pkumari**: We had our topping out party for the collective in Westfield.
**Pkumari**: We're doing.
**Jbriscella**: Oh, nice.
**Pkumari**: Same owner.
**Jbriscella**: Okay, awesome.
**Tgreen**: Yeah, no worries.
**Pkumari**: Who else are we missing?
**Pkumari**: jdawson Joe's joining.
**Skrumenacker**: Good afternoon.
**Housh**: Hello.
**Housh**: Good afternoon.
**Jbriscella**: I think we're just missing.
**Jbriscella**: Whoosh.
**Pkumari**: Oh, Justin, I'm gonna share.
**Pkumari**: Let me share the screen here.
**Pkumari**: So we sent, we sent this plan to Mike, you know, just for proposed layout and hotel and I think so we, we finalized some things, but he wanted to move some of this stuff around on this side, which he marked up.
**Pkumari**: But this is a hotel.
**Pkumari**: You know, the Harbor View.
**Pkumari**: I don't know if you're familiar with it, but Clearwater beach, like Clearwater downtown?
**Jbriscella**: Yeah.
**Pkumari**: Where they.
**Pkumari**: The Coachman's park is.
**Pkumari**: They're building this hotel, but it's a much bigger hotel than what we're looking.
**Pkumari**: But they like the look of this.
**Pkumari**: Like we can keep the pool deck, you know, on the roof level of one and then have the rooms come up the backside starting on level one, going up.
**Tgreen**: So when you say that looks like it's elevated, but you mean having the pool on grade level one.
**Pkumari**: Now that, that's a bad picture.
**Pkumari**: This is a little easier to see.
**Pkumari**: So like here is retail and a restaurant.
**Jbriscella**: Okay.
**Pkumari**: So what he's saying, for the hotel concept, they'd like first floor retail lobby.
**Pkumari**: You know, the entrance would be, you know, coming in from the back side on the parking lot.
**Pkumari**: I see, you know, from back here.
**Pkumari**: And then jdawson drew this up like just a figure.
**Pkumari**: Like the pool deck is like this with the swimming pool.
**Pkumari**: Got a little drink bar here, just serving drinks, only a couple restrooms.
**Jbriscella**: Okay.
**Pkumari**: And then, you know, just looking online, like these rooms are small, but seeing what would fit.
**Pkumari**: You know, for hotel rooms in there, this is 20 of them, but it's like a much smaller space.
**Pkumari**: This is only 124ft by 42ft.
**Tgreen**: What is that off of a brand or is that just a.
**Pkumari**: No, it's just a random.
**Pkumari**: Off the website.
**Pkumari**: Since they're gonna.
**Pkumari**: Right now, they just, they're gonna do their own thing.
**Pkumari**: They're not gonna like brand it at this point.
**Jbriscella**: Okay.
**Pkumari**: So.
**Pkumari**: So yeah, that's sort of thing.
**Pkumari**: Like we can adjust this as needed, but like five total floors, which before we were four with the rooftop bar.
**Pkumari**: I think, you know, they're gonna.
**Pkumari**: Then they cancel the idea for condos.
**Pkumari**: It'll just be hotels now.
**Jbriscella**: Okay.
**Pkumari**: So we don't have to worry about any of that.
**Pkumari**: But then, you know, on the first floor, they just want a 2,000 square foot conference room, a 6,000 square foot restaurant.
**Pkumari**: And then, you know, these would be.
**Pkumari**: We just shell spaces for now for some retail or whatever.
**Jbriscella**: Yeah.
**Pkumari**: The rest of the front.
**Tgreen**: Are you able to send me this when you get.
**Jbriscella**: When we get done here?
**Jbriscella**: Okay, cool.
**Pkumari**: Yeah.
**Pkumari**: And I.
**Pkumari**: That's why I just didn't want to confuse it because this is the one we did and it had these comments.
**Pkumari**: So I see.
**Pkumari**: I was just trying to move some stuff around, send it back to them and see, you know, because he wants like this kind of thing to be closer to the hotel.
**Tgreen**: Makes sense.
**Pkumari**: But yeah, having an outdoor like grass seating area with the big.
**Pkumari**: Outdoor.
**Pkumari**: Big screen.
**Pkumari**: They're, you know, they're not going to do the containers anymore.
**Pkumari**: They just want to build a building here for.
**Pkumari**: With like, I think, yeah, four restaurants and one bar beer wall.
**Pkumari**: And then like this would be the main entry for like foot traffic from the street coming up in it.
**Pkumari**: And then they wants the.
**Pkumari**: I think he was.
**Pkumari**: I understand.
**Pkumari**: And to me he wants the concert center kind of back here in the middle.
**Pkumari**: And then like the putt.
**Pkumari**: Putt.
**Pkumari**: He said he wanted it with some like roadside view so we can like wrap it around this thing.
**Pkumari**: Possibly because he was talking about like having a coffee shop.
**Pkumari**: But he would like it.
**Pkumari**: So, you know, all the people coming in from the parking lot could use it.
**Pkumari**: But also like if this is their vehicle traffic, if, you know, in other hours people were just passing through, not necessarily going here.
**Pkumari**: It would be help the business out if like everyone driving in.
**Jbriscella**: Yeah.
**Pkumari**: To go to the other sports complex things could just pull in here, get a coffee and go.
**Tgreen**: Is it going to be one of those small like where you can walk up or you can drive up or is it all walk up?
**Pkumari**: I think so.
**Pkumari**: Yeah.
**Pkumari**: It'll be like drive up here and then maybe the back side's open for people to walk up or on the sides or something.
**Jbriscella**: Yeah.
**Jbriscella**: Okay.
**Pkumari**: And then this was.
**Pkumari**: He sent us this as like his idea of what that would look like.
**Pkumari**: Like two floors for the main food building.
**Tgreen**: Oh, the main food building.
**Tgreen**: Oh, I see.
**Jbriscella**: Okay.
**Pkumari**: Yeah.
**Pkumari**: This here would be what this thing is here.
**Jbriscella**: Okay.
**Tgreen**: Similar for that drink bar on the other side.
**Pkumari**: Like this.
**Pkumari**: Yeah.
**Tgreen**: Is that like a similar structure?
**Jbriscella**: Yeah.
**Tgreen**: Maybe not two stories or this just.
**Pkumari**: Be a one story be so people could get drinks for the.
**Pkumari**: Between the volleyball courts.
**Pkumari**: This outdoor seating area.
**Pkumari**: They'd have options to go either direction.
**Pkumari**: And then back here you just want to put a dog park of some sort.
**Pkumari**: And then on the original plan, they had like cornhole and other whatever yard games they got over here somewhere.
**Pkumari**: So.
**Pkumari**: Yeah, that's.
**Pkumari**: We just want to get that dialed in with Mike so that we know we're starting off on the right foot.
**Pkumari**: Yeah.
**Tgreen**: Mike is the owner.
**Pkumari**: The owner.
**Pkumari**: Yep.
**Tgreen**: And then so I'll look again at this.
**Tgreen**: There's no program or no brand rather, for the.
**Tgreen**: For the hotel.
**Tgreen**: But I mean, I can look at a, like a Hilton prototype or something to start with.
**Pkumari**: Yeah, well, they want to do four star.
**Jbriscella**: Okay.
**Pkumari**: For the, for the design.
**Pkumari**: That's one thing the design team needed to know.
**Pkumari**: Yeah.
**Pkumari**: The.
**Pkumari**: What else?
**Pkumari**: Yeah, I think, like, we're very close to having.
**Tgreen**: Yeah, yeah.
**Tgreen**: So are you working with Housh then on the programming of the site?
**Tgreen**: And we're just looking at the building, and then once the site gets programmed, then we'll kind of step into the building portions of that.
**Pkumari**: Yeah, I think we'll get with Housh.
**Pkumari**: We'll get the site layout.
**Pkumari**: We'll get that approved.
**Pkumari**: He can do like an initial plan so we know what kind of spaces we're working in.
**Pkumari**: We'll get the square footages of the restaurants.
**Pkumari**: Because he just said, you know, four restaurants in a bar.
**Pkumari**: But we don't know what that.
**Pkumari**: The size of those.
**Tgreen**: What does that mean?
**Jbriscella**: Yeah.
**Jbriscella**: Okay.
**Pkumari**: Yeah.
**Pkumari**: And so we'll get that worked out.
**Pkumari**: Next week, Jesse's going to work on getting all the design contracts out.
**Pkumari**: So we'll get you and everyone else contract for the work sent out.
**Jbriscella**: Okay.
**Jbriscella**: Yeah.
**Tgreen**: And then sounds like we'll need to sound like we should modify before you do that now with the new program.
**Pkumari**: That's what I'm saying.
**Pkumari**: That's before we, you know, we'll get everything drafted, but like, now we got a, you know, different size, shape, hotel.
**Pkumari**: And, you know, one thing too is Mike uses.
**Pkumari**: For the last two projects, he's used this interior designer.
**Pkumari**: I think that people are out of Colorado and he seems to like them.
**Pkumari**: And so that's the only, like, that's what I was telling you about the interior design of it that, you know, he may go with his guy because he does all his furniture planning, you know, all of his interior designs.
**Pkumari**: But again, I don't know if that guy's a hotelier or.
**Jbriscella**: Yeah.
**Tgreen**: Okay, so that.
**Tgreen**: That's still a question mark then, is what I'm hearing.
**Jbriscella**: Yeah.
**Pkumari**: Okay, so we'll get that figured out.
**Pkumari**: You know, we can Plan on to, you know, I just imagine this being, you know, all the group, you know.
**Pkumari**: Now we'll just have a flat roof.
**Pkumari**: We can put all the MEP or the H VAC equipment up on the roof.
**Pkumari**: Yeah, I don't know.
**Pkumari**: Joe.
**Skrumenacker**: Yes.
**Pkumari**: I don't remember.
**Pkumari**: Joe, are you doing plumbing, mechanical or were you electrical or structural?
**Pkumari**: I'm sorry, what's that?
**Skrumenacker**: Structural.
**Pkumari**: Oh, structural.
**Pkumari**: Okay.
**Pkumari**: I was way off.
**Skrumenacker**: I can give it a try.
**Pkumari**: Well, flows downhill.
**Pkumari**: You'd be a plumbing engineer.
**Pkumari**: I used to be a plumber.
**Pkumari**: And they said you only had to know three Things flows downhill.
**Pkumari**: Payday's Friday and the boss is always a jerk.
**Pkumari**: So that's it.
**Pkumari**: I was a plumber.
**Pkumari**: But yeah.
**Pkumari**: So structural wise too.
**Pkumari**: Joe.
**Pkumari**: Then if all this.
**Pkumari**: I don't know if you were able to.
**Pkumari**: If you're on.
**Pkumari**: When we started showing us this is kind of what they've settled into on the hotel design.
**Pkumari**: So you know, we got it like my sub gave me a pretty decent number on post tension.
**Pkumari**: So we're most likely go that route for the structure and then.
**Pkumari**: But this will simplify things just because of, you know, we have the pool on this deck.
**Pkumari**: We can make this like 20 foot tall or whatever we need to and then we got room for the pool shell everything to fit here and we're not going to be over any living.
**Pkumari**: And also it's not condos anymore.
**Pkumari**: It's going to just be a hotel because they don't want to deal with that headache.
**Jbriscella**: Okay.
**Skrumenacker**: And then did I hear correctly that this.
**Skrumenacker**: I'll say the site area.
**Tgreen**: Right.
**Skrumenacker**: Originally the intent was some sort of like prefabricated shipping container type look.
**Skrumenacker**: But that's now shift.
**Skrumenacker**: We're now shifting away from that concept and it's going to be for the most part structured buildings.
**Pkumari**: Right.
**Pkumari**: And like these that, you know, the.
**Pkumari**: Even the two story would probably just be framed, you know, you know, that could be even wood I would imagine.
**Pkumari**: Framing possibly.
**Pkumari**: Or you know, I don't.
**Pkumari**: I haven't really thought about what to build that out of.
**Pkumari**: This is just a single, you know, single floor building.
**Pkumari**: They are going to still have some containers like they want containers behind here and these storage units.
**Pkumari**: But nothing that's going to be like MEP or you know, something that we gotta design around like humans to be using for some purpose.
**Jbriscella**: Okay.
**Jbriscella**: So we'll.
**Skrumenacker**: Yeah, we'll still have some sort of foundation design for.
**Skrumenacker**: For just a reduced scope of.
**Pkumari**: Yeah.
**Skrumenacker**: Containers.
**Jbriscella**: Okay.
**Jbriscella**: Yep.
**Pkumari**: I can't.
**Pkumari**: I would think hopefully these are just like a Turn down slab and for the perimeter.
**Pkumari**: I don't know you.
**Pkumari**: The structural engineer will let you guys.
**Pkumari**: Once we dial in the size of them and kind of what they want, then we can get that going.
**Pkumari**: This concert stage is still the same.
**Pkumari**: It's just being moved around a little bit to where it's going to go.
**Skrumenacker**: Sorry.
**Skrumenacker**: The turn down slab comment made me think of geotechnical.
**Skrumenacker**: I don't know if we touched on that on the last call.
**Pkumari**: Yeah, we have.
**Pkumari**: Yeah, we need to get one done.
**Pkumari**: I have to check with the city.
**Pkumari**: I don't know if they did anything on that front here or not.
**Pkumari**: So we'll check with them and see if they've done it.
**Pkumari**: If not, we'll.
**Pkumari**: That's one of the first things, obviously, we've got to get going.
**Pkumari**: That and the surveys and everything else with Northside.
**Tgreen**: Fire Flow.
**Pkumari**: We got the fire department right there.
**Pkumari**: So that is put on.
**Pkumari**: Just hook up their truck and spray it next door.
**Tgreen**: Spray east.
**Jbriscella**: Yeah.
**Jbriscella**: Yeah.
**Jbriscella**: Okay, cool.
**Jbriscella**: Okay.
**Tgreen**: Well, yeah, I'll take a look at the document.
**Tgreen**: You send it back over and let you know any other questions that we've got to kind of hone in and clean up.
**Tgreen**: And pkumari, I'll get with you and we'll.
**Tgreen**: We'll clean up our, you know, the program that we've got covered here.
**Housh**: Okay.
**Tgreen**: And then we'll wait on, I guess, confirmation of program.
**Tgreen**: I might shoot you back an outline of the program to be clear first, jdawson.
**Tgreen**: And then we'll update our.
**Tgreen**: Our proposal and then just let me know on the interiors.
**Tgreen**: We can.
**Tgreen**: We can keep that out for now and until they make a decision.
**Tgreen**: And then.
**Tgreen**: Yeah, as.
**Tgreen**: As the site gets firmed up, then we can step into that too.
**Jbriscella**: Okay.
**Pkumari**: Yeah.
**Pkumari**: Jess, if you want to just copy everyone on our meeting invite with the.
**Pkumari**: The plan that we sent out initially and then the one that Mike sent back to us marked up just so everyone knows kind of what we're working on.
**Jbriscella**: Okay.
**Jbriscella**: Okay.
**Tgreen**: Awesome.
**Jbriscella**: Cool.
**Pkumari**: Well, everybody have a great weekend.
**Jbriscella**: Thank you.
**Jbriscella**: You too.
**Tgreen**: Appreciate it.
**Jbriscella**: Everybody.
**Tgreen**: Sounds good.
**Pkumari**: We'll check in if we need to for.
**Pkumari**: But otherwise, two weeks.
**Pkumari**: We'll meet up again.
**Jbriscella**: Good.
**Jbriscella**: All right.
**Pkumari**: Sounds good, everybody.
