## Transcript
**Jremillard**: bclymer, hey, I'm in the meeting, but.
**Bclymer**: You guys aren't in here.
**Jremillard**: We're trying in here.
**Bclymer**: Did you send two invites?
**Jremillard**: Hold on.
**Jremillard**: No, I just called Jesse.
**Jremillard**: I'm sorry.
**Jremillard**: Let me get in the meeting.
**Jremillard**: I called him before the meeting started.
**Jremillard**: All right, we'll get in.
**Jremillard**: Okay, see you.
**Jremillard**: Sorry, I was muted.
**Jremillard**: Hey, Jesse.
**Jremillard**: Hey.
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: Yes.
**Jremillard**: We were just going through it.
**Jremillard**: What's the budget for building one?
**Speaker 2**: Pulling it up right now.
**Speaker 2**: 55, 725.
**Speaker 2**: 55 million.
**Jremillard**: 55, 725.
**Jremillard**: Change this.
**Jremillard**: All right, building two.
**Speaker 2**: 1.624.
**Speaker 2**: Okay, so kind of like Alex talk.
**Jremillard**: What are you.
**Bclymer**: What are you typing, Jesse?
**Jremillard**: I was trying to figure out their A calculation for these design fees.
**Jremillard**: I thought he was saying.
**Jremillard**: Well, they were basing this off a dollar amount.
**Jremillard**: Oh.
**Bclymer**: Could be tiered, too.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: All right, what's building 329953?
**Speaker 2**: 29,953,000.
**Jremillard**: Let me just see what this is.
**Bclymer**: The 48 unit.
**Bclymer**: 48 condos, mixed use.
**Bclymer**: That mixed use building on the island.
**Speaker 2**: It's the one up by the dock.
**Jremillard**: Okay, so they're starting 3.29% on this one.
**Jremillard**: Charging 17% on this one.
**Jremillard**: Jesus Christ.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, well, that.
**Jremillard**: I just.
**Jremillard**: I don't think they understood that one at all.
**Jremillard**: See, this one is 2%.
**Jremillard**: Building 4, how much was that one?
**Speaker 2**: Building 4 is 62,512,000.
**Jremillard**: 84%.
**Speaker 2**: Are they designing the golf course, too?
**Jremillard**: No.
**Speaker 2**: Okay, so they have it lumped into their building five cost, I think.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: Because, like, what was that building 5 budget?
**Speaker 2**: 42 million.
**Jremillard**: For that.
**Jremillard**: But how much is just the clubhouse?
**Jremillard**: You able to kind of extrapolate that.
**Speaker 2**: It'S not split off?
**Speaker 2**: I'd have to pull up the estimate.
**Jremillard**: Sheet because the golf course was like 20 some million.
**Jremillard**: So let's just say half of it.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: Golf courses coming in at 21 million.
**Jremillard**: Okay, six, nine.
**Jremillard**: And then building six, the parking garage.
**Speaker 2**: 46,958,000.
**Speaker 2**: Golf course is actually 26 million.
**Speaker 2**: There was two earthwork lines hidden up there.
**Jremillard**: It's not even a percent on this one.
**Jremillard**: Building 7A and B.
**Speaker 2**: 66,478,000.
**Jremillard**: All right, 9A and B.
**Speaker 2**: Do you want to do eight?
**Jremillard**: Just combine the two.
**Jremillard**: They're the same price.
**Bclymer**: Construction cost is 2.290.
**Bclymer**: It's 1.497.
**Bclymer**: So it's 0.51%.
**Bclymer**: No, it's 0.9.
**Bclymer**: Or, I'm sorry, 0.51%.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: 9C is.
**Bclymer**: Total is five hundred and forty seven for them, 60 million for us.
**Bclymer**: So 0.9%.
**Jremillard**: On 9C, 9C, 10D and 10E.
**Jremillard**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: 0.9%.
**Jremillard**: 0.9.
**Jremillard**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: The next one is 0.8.
**Jremillard**: What's the budget on the ninth?
**Bclymer**: 9C is 60 million 735.
**Bclymer**: 314.
**Speaker 2**: Are you pulling that off the tabs, bclymer?
**Jremillard**: Nope.
**Bclymer**: I just did this.
**Bclymer**: Take a look.
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: I just asked.
**Jremillard**: I just.
**Bclymer**: I took a screenshot of.
**Bclymer**: Of our summary and their summary, and I told ChatGPT to give me a table and tell me the percentages.
**Jremillard**: So your computer's smarter than me and faster.
**Jremillard**: Jesus.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I mean, I literally got in here, typed it up real quick.
**Bclymer**: I mean, this is.
**Bclymer**: This is right here.
**Bclymer**: This is what I did.
**Bclymer**: You guys gonna start.
**Bclymer**: I'm telling you guys gotta start using it so easy.
**Speaker 2**: I just learned it has an 1100 IQ today.
**Jremillard**: What about 10A and B?
**Jremillard**: What is it?
**Bclymer**: It's right here.
**Bclymer**: It's 0.8% is the design.
**Bclymer**: Construction.
**Jremillard**: Our total for Construction cost is 1417-081071-41708,107.
**Jremillard**: Yep.
**Jremillard**: Gotcha.
**Jremillard**: And 10C.
**Bclymer**: 10C is 141.
**Bclymer**: 708, 107.
**Jremillard**: A and B.
**Bclymer**: A and B.
**Jremillard**: You have 1100.
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, those two are the same.
**Jremillard**: The same.
**Jremillard**: But the one had the amenity area and correct golf course.
**Jremillard**: So their percentage worked out on that other one to point two one.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And I'm not sure what 11A and D is.
**Jremillard**: There it is.
**Speaker 2**: That's the guard shack at the pool house.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: 11A through D is the first ones.
**Jremillard**: We're doing E through F. Is the second one the bigger one or.
**Jremillard**: No, the A through D is the bigger one.
**Jremillard**: Got a bigger budget.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: 45 million right here.
**Jremillard**: A through C is 45.
**Jremillard**: The other one's 60.
**Jremillard**: I got you 45 by 45.
**Jremillard**: No, 6, 4.
**Jremillard**: I didn't pick up the price of the 11E and F, which is 60 million something.
**Bclymer**: 735.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, it just.
**Bclymer**: It just missed it.
**Bclymer**: And I missed it, too.
**Jremillard**: 314.
**Jremillard**: There you go.
**Bclymer**: Point 36.
**Jremillard**: And those make sense because they're just.
**Jremillard**: They're the same building over and over.
**Jremillard**: So it's not like they gotta design a bunch of shit.
**Bclymer**: All right, you can go back to sharing your first one.
**Bclymer**: Building 12, it's 72 million 242, 514 construction costs and 72.
**Bclymer**: 242, 514.
**Bclymer**: And it's 0.19% for the percentage.
**Jremillard**: And then they're missing 8.
**Speaker 2**: And the lighthouse Club, Marina restrooms and kayak shack, if they're doing those there.
**Bclymer**: I just sent you guys that table at night.
**Jremillard**: Okay, thank you.
**Jremillard**: And the.
**Jremillard**: The boathouse was 16 million for the dry boat storage.
**Speaker 2**: 16, 942.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: 16, 9, 42, 130.
**Bclymer**: Dog killed.
**Bclymer**: Another goddamn possum boy.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, just murder machine, you know, like.
**Speaker 2**: Is he bigger than a possum?
**Bclymer**: He's more ferocious.
**Jremillard**: That's for danger.
**Jremillard**: Things are nasty.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, they are that 1.5% and then we'll chat.
**Jremillard**: GPT say.
**Bclymer**: Say what?
**Bclymer**: Which SBT what?
**Jremillard**: I'm just wondering.
**Jremillard**: So obviously, like some of these, like this one's way out of whack.
**Jremillard**: This one's way out of whack.
**Jremillard**: This one is too.
**Bclymer**: What's your question?
**Bclymer**: What did you want to say?
**Jremillard**: Well, just, it would figure out what, you know, based on this total amount by 1.5%.
**Jremillard**: What does that total up to?
**Jremillard**: If it just average that on all of these.
**Bclymer**: So you want to know the average.
**Bclymer**: If it averages all the percentages or you want to know what the, what it, what the cost should be if it was 1.5% for each building.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, I mean, well, like, obviously some of these just are not that.
**Jremillard**: I'm just thinking about when we go to talk to them about this.
**Jremillard**: Like.
**Speaker 2**: Where should that be?
**Jremillard**: Yeah, where this should be.
**Jremillard**: Like.
**Jremillard**: And I'm just saying, based on, you know, talking with Chris, I think, was I telling you, the structural engineer, you know, he said he's looked at their other jobs.
**Jremillard**: They charge 1.5% of construction costs.
**Jremillard**: Was their average.
**Jremillard**: What, what they were charging.
**Jremillard**: So in.
**Jremillard**: Technically, this building would be low.
**Jremillard**: These all would be high.
**Jremillard**: I don't know what the overall, because some of these, which when it's townhomes and apartments, obviously it's not much work because it's the same over and over again.
**Jremillard**: You got the same floor plan, it's used 120 times.
**Jremillard**: And then the whole construction administration, I would see how they're breaking that out.
**Jremillard**: Or they get six people.
**Jremillard**: Is that when we got 10 buildings who want.
**Jremillard**: At the same time, they figure they're going to need a full time six person team.
**Jremillard**: At one point they got nine people for six months just doing submittals, RFIs, things of that nature.
**Bclymer**: So if, if design costs were calculated at 1.5% construction cost for each building, the total design cost would be $16 million.
**Jremillard**: Mm.
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: So when it comes to their construction administration, you know, one thing I know about condo building is you don't have a spec book number one.
**Jremillard**: And you just put everything on the drawings and if anything is changed from what's put in that's different than the drawings, then you gotta have the drawings updated to match that.
**Jremillard**: I'm just thinking of their construction administration.
**Jremillard**: It might be important that we have them looking at everything that we put in there and making sure it's the right stuff or at least and then it's on them.
**Jremillard**: If they approve something different they got to change their drawing at the end of it for the as built.
**Jremillard**: But anyways we can go up through here now looking at the like this is something I'm not sure he's saying a 2.5% surcharge for insurance.
**Jremillard**: Is he saying they didn't include any insurance in their proposal and it's going to be added to the total cost?
**Bclymer**: That's the way I understand that.
**Jremillard**: So have to figure that out.
**Jremillard**: Like are they going to be reviewing our contractor pay app?
**Jremillard**: No.
**Jremillard**: So we get rid of that monthly construction observation travel.
**Jremillard**: I don't see need of that use for that.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, I mean they talk about up here for life safety ADA FHA that they're going to start life safety diagrams.
**Jremillard**: So I don't know why they're saying they don't have life safety.
**Jremillard**: That's just a difference between one section of the proposal and another.
**Jremillard**: And he's saying interior design shall be fully responsible for model room design.
**Jremillard**: And then up here he says says the interior designer is not known at this time.
**Jremillard**: Does that mean they just haven't picked their interior designer?
**Jremillard**: He's not real clear on.
**Bclymer**: That's what it sounds like to me.
**Jremillard**: They have all the interior design, they just haven't picked them yet.
**Bclymer**: Correct.
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: Just want to confirm that the industry level 300 is fine.
**Jremillard**: That gets everything up to the point where our subs can do our BIM coordination.
**Bclymer**: I gotta jump in this 4O'.
**Jremillard**: Clock.
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: All right.
**Jremillard**: But I mean overall we're close on like with the budget we currently have for interior design and architectural.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, just some of that stuff like that two and a half percent and whatnot like surcharge like for insurance.
**Speaker 2**: It's like what are you.
**Bclymer**: Like you're not insuring it.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And again I say we reserve.
**Bclymer**: We take a hard look at this.
**Bclymer**: If like.
**Bclymer**: All right, what if we.
**Bclymer**: Let's take a look at like breaking up buildings, you know.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I mean like we look at you know again, you know, some of this stuff like building one.
**Bclymer**: We could you know, break it out.
**Jremillard**: Right.
**Bclymer**: The Design cost is 1.3 million.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: And I'm just thinking if, you know, when it comes to the interior design, I don't know if that would be possible to keep that the same if it's just someone they're going to hire.
**Jremillard**: Just so we're not reinventing the wheel because everything's going to kind of tie together.
**Jremillard**: Well.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I mean, yes, you could, but I, I would think we, we almost want a different design, a different interior designer for like the townhomes.
**Bclymer**: That's going to be a completely different product.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So you know the hotel.
**Jremillard**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Like, I mean that, you know, the condos and stuff.
**Jremillard**: Sure.
**Jremillard**: Like, but.
**Jremillard**: All right.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I'm jumping this.
**Bclymer**: I'll talk to you later.
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: All right, see you.
**Jremillard**: What was Building 12 again.
**Speaker 2**: The value.
**Jremillard**: Or Building 12 on here?
**Jremillard**: It's just a maintenance shop.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: We have that included with 11E and F.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, it's the one down by the townhomes.
**Speaker 2**: 10D and 9C.
**Jremillard**: That's right.
**Jremillard**: So this is included in 9C.
**Jremillard**: 10D.
**Jremillard**: Tenny.
**Speaker 2**: And I think Building 18 is rolled into that too.
**Speaker 2**: That golf maintenance out in the course.
**Jremillard**: I put that in the golf course, but I got this calculation wrong because this is really 547,000 plus 38 divided by 60 million 725.
**Jremillard**: 314.
**Jremillard**: So this one's really old to 1.12 have 54 months of time in here.
**Jremillard**: That's four and a half years.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, because we that draw schedule that went out had it at 4 years, 8 months.
**Jremillard**: You see like on our at 114 they have the interior design plus 2, 2, 4, 8.
**Jremillard**: So that's 137 almost.
**Jremillard**: alleatogroup what are your thoughts?
**Jremillard**: Jesse?
**Speaker 2**: I think we just need to have a meeting with them and go through it.
**Jremillard**: Because.
**Speaker 2**: I'm trying to scroll ears.
**Speaker 2**: Did you see this table on page three?
**Jremillard**: Oh, this is wrong too.
**Jremillard**: So these are the 141 is the total for these two buildings.
**Jremillard**: This is put it in 10A.
**Jremillard**: Right.
**Jremillard**: The 141.
**Jremillard**: 708 is the total for those 200 unit condos.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: 148.
**Speaker 2**: 1708-107.
**Jremillard**: This is one 1%.
**Jremillard**: See here alleatogroup it's like they had one person do the left hand side of the page and a different person to the right hand side.
**Speaker 2**: That's what I was saying.
**Speaker 2**: Different people put them together and then they didn't look at the two combined before they sent it.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, you have a calculator there Yep.
**Jremillard**: See what the difference is?
**Jremillard**: Like, these costs.
**Jremillard**: Like, let's just see how much they really are high in that.
**Speaker 2**: What cost versus what cost.
**Jremillard**: So down here.
**Jremillard**: See, we finish this last one here.
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: So pick this one.
**Jremillard**: The difference between this 1 million 4.
**Jremillard**: 27 versus 997.
**Jremillard**: 170.
**Jremillard**: If we're using 1.5 as a benchmark.
**Speaker 2**: 430,530.
**Speaker 2**: 4.
**Jremillard**: 35.
**Jremillard**: 30.
**Jremillard**: Yep.
**Jremillard**: 435.
**Jremillard**: 30.
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: All right.
**Jremillard**: How much is this?
**Jremillard**: $20,000 one for the $20 million.
**Speaker 2**: Which one is that?
**Jremillard**: That's 30.
**Jremillard**: I can do that in my head.
**Jremillard**: That's 438,000 more.
**Jremillard**: 400.
**Jremillard**: I got the.
**Jremillard**: It's the blue down here.
**Jremillard**: Like, if you just look at the budget, the 62, 5 12, they want 1 million 152.
**Jremillard**: We're saying it should be 937.
**Jremillard**: 680.
**Jremillard**: What is that difference between those two?
**Speaker 2**: 214.
**Speaker 2**: 320.
**Jremillard**: And there's this one here.
**Jremillard**: 987 versus 449.
**Speaker 2**: 537705.
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: We have 24,000 versus 283.
**Speaker 2**: 259440.
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: And this difference here.
**Speaker 2**: 835-5-16.
**Speaker 2**: 425.
**Jremillard**: We add all these up here.
**Speaker 2**: 2.396820.
**Jremillard**: I came up with two.
**Jremillard**: 396.
**Jremillard**: 820.
**Jremillard**: Yep.
**Jremillard**: That's what they're high.
**Jremillard**: S.A. here we are.
**Jremillard**: That's the budget we were looking for.
**Speaker 2**: That's some serious proposal qualifying.
**Jremillard**: I mean, that's a ton.
**Jremillard**: That's like a million a year.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: Like really they pay architects.
**Jremillard**: They're the lowest paid people in the universe.
**Jremillard**: They're gonna have some intern in there that they pay 60 grand a year.
**Jremillard**: Yep.
**Speaker 2**: And we're gonna.
**Speaker 2**: We're gonna pay to fix all the errors that we find in IT.
**Speaker 2**: Forum.
**Jremillard**: He said one and a quarter to one and a half.
**Jremillard**: And like, overall, we're probably there at that.
**Jremillard**: And it includes a lot of repetitive all the time homes.
**Jremillard**: All the other stuff.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, that's all just copy and paste.
**Speaker 2**: Once I get one.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: Is it six units or five in a cluster?
**Jremillard**: Mm.
**Speaker 2**: So and all those nines and tens.
**Jremillard**: Or.
**Speaker 2**: Excuse me, the elevens.
**Speaker 2**: 11a through and 11b and all that shit, Those are all the same.
**Jremillard**: Yep.
**Speaker 2**: Oh, you got an 11A through D, but I think 11D.
**Speaker 2**: Oh, set 11C.
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Speaker 2**: Because C and D are the pool houses.
**Jremillard**: alleatogroup.
**Speaker 2**: Oh, and I got the oncologist appointment scheduled today.
**Speaker 2**: It's September 5th.
**Jremillard**: Oh, really?
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: And then I would get figured out what the hell's going on.
**Speaker 2**: Hopefully it's a 45 minute assessment and then I'm assuming that he's going to set up some kind of really nasty test for me.
**Speaker 2**: Like that bone marrow thing.
**Jremillard**: Damn.
**Jremillard**: September 5th.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, I made it for 2:30 my time.
**Speaker 2**: So it's well after business hours for out there.
**Speaker 2**: And that's Labor Day week.
**Jremillard**: Where's it at?
**Jremillard**: Is it there?
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, it's just right down the street.
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Speaker 2**: The address that they gave me, I think it's right in the hospital campus that I of the emergency room I went to.
**Jremillard**: That's kind of good.
**Jremillard**: It's the same place they got you all your records.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: The doctor you know or is someone new?
**Speaker 2**: No, this is a new guy.
**Speaker 2**: I've never been to an oncologist before.
**Jremillard**: Oncologist?
**Jremillard**: Is that specific?
**Jremillard**: Like blood?
**Speaker 2**: Like a blood doctor that's a cancer doctor.
**Jremillard**: Well, hopefully it's just like false alarm.
**Jremillard**: We're just with you.
**Speaker 2**: I've already ruled out that hope.
**Speaker 2**: The scary part is, is the silent killer part.
**Speaker 2**: Like if I get a blood clot, which I'm apparently highly susceptible to, I could just drop.
**Speaker 2**: But the good news is it doesn't sound like it's the suffering kind of drop.
**Speaker 2**: It's the light switch kind.
**Jremillard**: Dang.
**Jremillard**: Why?
**Speaker 2**: Oh, the parking deck you left off.
**Jremillard**: Building six, that were 0.84, so they were already low.
**Jremillard**: And that's just a parking garage.
**Jremillard**: What are they going to design in that thing, you know?
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, it's just the amenity deck.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: Which we're going to probably get rid of.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, that's.
**Speaker 2**: There's a lot of ve of things that sound nice, but in all reality are probably going to be not very useful.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: Because like again, you're not going to be playing tennis up there or else there's balls flying everywhere.
**Jremillard**: Who's gonna go?
**Jremillard**: Yeah, like no one's even gonna know that shit's up there.
**Jremillard**: Really.
**Jremillard**: Because.
**Speaker 2**: Play around the cornhole when you park your car.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: And so all that on top of there and it makes more sense to me.
**Jremillard**: Just have another deck of exposed parking.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: Like the top layer would just be open, you know.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: Uncovered parking for overflow.
**Jremillard**: You know, they could make all the, you know, valet park up there or some.
**Speaker 2**: They could probably shrink it down quite a bit too.
**Speaker 2**: Get rid of the amenity deck.
**Speaker 2**: Like the footprint of it.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, you're right.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: If we change those parking spaces into the building.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: I would Imagine parking is going to be a premium on this island, so.
**Jremillard**: Oh yeah, yeah, we do those things.
**Speaker 2**: Is this area drivable right now?
**Speaker 2**: Like you can drive through it?
**Jremillard**: Mm, yeah, I didn't, I don't know why, like I didn't pull the information before.
**Jremillard**: I don't know why this link ain't working.
**Jremillard**: But like these plans.
**Jremillard**: Are the permit set of plans open.
**Jremillard**: There we go.
**Jremillard**: Wonder let me check something out here and see if he's saved.
**Jremillard**: Right.
**Jremillard**: See how they, they even drew like they drew on this civil plan here.
**Jremillard**: There's that existing marina right in here.
**Jremillard**: And then this is the.
**Jremillard**: This used to be the golf course clubhouse parking lot.
**Jremillard**: There's like two tennis courts here.
**Jremillard**: This is where the clubhouse used to be.
**Jremillard**: So like this is all dry land.
**Jremillard**: Like this road that goes through here ends here.
**Jremillard**: You can't drive completely through, but there's a couple ponds, existing ponds in here.
**Jremillard**: That's it.
**Jremillard**: Oh.
**Jremillard**: So this elevation is at 4.825.
**Jremillard**: We gotta go up to nine.
**Speaker 2**: For the island.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: Looks like this stuff is 6.4.
**Jremillard**: I think we gotta raise everything over here.
**Jremillard**: Really?
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, this is lowland swamp from what it looks like right now, isn't it?
**Jremillard**: Not really.
**Jremillard**: Like this area over here is on this side of the property that's all shitty marshy.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, that's where the apartments go or.
**Speaker 2**: No, that's the maintenance building in the condo townhomes area.
**Jremillard**: Those two 300 unit condos are here.
**Jremillard**: Island will be right here.
**Speaker 2**: Is it safe to assume people in Florida have big civil equipment like scrapers and ship?
**Jremillard**: Oh yeah.
**Jremillard**: Yep.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, we're thinking of buying our own equipment.
**Speaker 2**: For this job.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, like Brandon's like, you know with the new trunk thing you purchase, it's like 100 write off now when you buy new equipment.
**Jremillard**: So.
**Jremillard**: And I got a guy here, a local guy that he's a.
**Jremillard**: Started his own dirt company down here and we could do something, some deal with him.
**Jremillard**: We'd buy the equipment, we get to write it off, he does all the work and at the end of it we'll just give him the equipment because we won't give a.
**Jremillard**: It'll be paid for, work out some deal.
**Jremillard**: So then he would be able to build up his equipment inventory.
**Jremillard**: Oh yeah.
**Jremillard**: Site work done cheap.
**Speaker 2**: Especially if it's like cat stuff.
**Speaker 2**: He'd probably be all over that.
**Jremillard**: Hell yeah.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: Those pans are like a million and a half each.
**Speaker 2**: Has anyone looked into Maria's area for buying it?
**Speaker 2**: Do you know about the weird shit down there with equipment where in South America.
**Speaker 2**: CAT disperses all their new overstock in those villages down there to write it off.
**Speaker 2**: So all the villages they give like this village an excavator.
**Speaker 2**: This village a dozer.
**Speaker 2**: This village a 740 haul truck.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: So they all have the ability to work together to develop their villages with all this brand new CAT equipment.
**Speaker 2**: When I went down there I couldn't believe it.
**Speaker 2**: There's brand new shit everywhere.
**Speaker 2**: Like sitting behind somebody's house is a brand new 988 loader.
**Jremillard**: Did they.
**Jremillard**: And then they'll sell it to us.
**Speaker 2**: Oh yeah.
**Speaker 2**: I'm sure that they'd be more than happy.
**Speaker 2**: Because who can afford it down there besides big contractors that probably have their own resources.
**Jremillard**: Right.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: We'll definitely look into that too.
**Jremillard**: I mean but yeah.
**Jremillard**: Just buy the equipment like these.
**Jremillard**: Like all of this will just be a big excavator.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: I'll just be digging this all out.
**Jremillard**: That'll be the plan.
**Jremillard**: Just build all this first and then dig out.
**Jremillard**: You know.
**Jremillard**: If we can.
**Jremillard**: But with that this is where all our fills coming from.
**Jremillard**: So we may have to.
**Jremillard**: Oh yeah.
**Speaker 2**: You get a 385 excavator and a few 740s and you can move that real fast.
**Jremillard**: Never remembered all the equipment names.
**Jremillard**: I'm kind of impressed with people that know the different equipment.
**Jremillard**: What it's called.
**Jremillard**: I just like those are.
**Speaker 2**: I was worked in mining and I was certified with M. Shot a task train on any piece of equipment on a mine site.
**Speaker 2**: Like I had no limit on class I could train people on.
**Speaker 2**: So I just learned everything because there's a mix of so much on mine sites.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: But damn.
**Speaker 2**: 385 is the big guy in the 740s is the one size from the biggest articulating haul truck.
**Speaker 2**: They just.
**Speaker 2**: They're lighter so they can get around to this marshy shit and like permafrost easier.
**Jremillard**: Damn.
**Jremillard**: Well there you go.
**Jremillard**: You can.
**Jremillard**: You're the expert on equipment.
**Jremillard**: Let you dial that one in.
**Jremillard**: It can be your.
**Speaker 2**: I'd be happy to work with that dirt guy on picking good stuff because machine controls on the dozers and like that's going to be huge too.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: That'll grade everything for you.
**Jremillard**: So yeah.
**Jremillard**: It looks like you're trucking in some fill.
**Jremillard**: Holy.
**Jremillard**: 2.7.
**Jremillard**: 2.8.
**Speaker 2**: We don't have geotech for this yet.
**Jremillard**: Right.
**Jremillard**: I thought there was.
**Jremillard**: Let me see.
**Jremillard**: Let me go back to this report here.
**Speaker 2**: Finding out how much we have to export to sooner than later would help.
**Jremillard**: I don't think we're gonna.
**Jremillard**: We'll be importing.
**Jremillard**: If these grades are right, we won't.
**Speaker 2**: Have to export ship material.
**Speaker 2**: We'll just have to import structural and fill.
**Jremillard**: Well, I would think.
**Jremillard**: Well then again.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: I don't know what this stuff is we're digging out but.
**Speaker 2**: Because we can lose a lot of that in the golf course green spaces between the holes.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: But if they.
**Speaker 2**: If they have a reclamation plan for any of this then that's gonna tell us what we can do because we can propose grade changes to those unused spaces between the holes if we want to dump more shit there and eliminate having to export bad stuff and pay for it.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: I didn't realize this so low back here.
**Jremillard**: 2.3.
**Jremillard**: We had 7 foot of fill in there.
**Jremillard**: But we got to cut all this out.
**Jremillard**: Is that.
**Speaker 2**: If they have scrapers cutting that out won't take long.
**Jremillard**: Well but these are.
**Jremillard**: This would be just like canals.
**Jremillard**: I don't know that we like like mass there won't be cutting anything down.
**Jremillard**: I think they'll have to just dig out the marina area.
**Speaker 2**: Oh they don't have any overburden.
**Speaker 2**: They gotta strip off before we can put suitable down any of that.
**Speaker 2**: Because that's all buildings in that area right there.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: Down here they just use a dozer and to push it up in a pile and then use an excavator.
**Jremillard**: Put it in the truck to dump it.
**Jremillard**: No.
**Jremillard**: Oh.
**Jremillard**: You know, obviously this is a lot bigger site so maybe that makes sense.
**Jremillard**: But like we're not going to do that to the golf course.
**Jremillard**: It should be just kind of dialed into this area.
**Speaker 2**: I did a six foot cut on a 90 acre site and I think there was six scrapers in the line and it took like three weeks.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: Well.
**Jremillard**: But I think the Island's like what, 11 acres there.
**Jremillard**: These rest of these.
**Jremillard**: I think the majority of it's all the golf course.
**Jremillard**: Only had one job in Colorado they did that.
**Jremillard**: But the building the site up.
**Jremillard**: They were using pans to do it.
**Jremillard**: But this farmer was.
**Jremillard**: It's.
**Jremillard**: He's like a farmer developer and he was raising up all of his property there like a big cornfield.
**Speaker 2**: So is Pam the Florida name for scraper?
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: I guess.
**Jremillard**: Scrapers.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: Well they call excavators monkey arms down here.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: We got really good surveying that lives close.
**Jremillard**: I'm sorry, what about do we got.
**Speaker 2**: A really good surveyor that lives close.
**Jremillard**: I'm sure we can hire one.
**Jremillard**: Have plenty of.
**Jremillard**: It'll be like a Full time surveyor job for five years.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: And they're really hard to get a hold of.
**Speaker 2**: Short notice.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, well, definitely we're going to invest in.
**Jremillard**: They got those new robots that go and lay out all the.
**Jremillard**: Your elevated deck, you know, all the sleeves and penetrations and all that shit.
**Speaker 2**: And they also have that.
**Speaker 2**: What's that?
**Jremillard**: Oh, just to make sure everything's right.
**Jremillard**: You know, you get the wrong foreman or he's hungover or something and then you got in the wrong spot and it's like it just ain't worth it.
**Jremillard**: It's such a headache because sometimes you can't even move the.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, the right spot.
**Speaker 2**: Teaching the.
**Speaker 2**: The art field team how to read.
**Speaker 2**: Great stakes would be helpful too.
**Speaker 2**: It's easy.
**Speaker 2**: But they have a new app for the phone and you can actually get a pogo stick, like a surveying stick with a phone holder on it.
**Speaker 2**: And you can go.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, you can go grade check stuff.
**Speaker 2**: I have the name written in my phone with that app.
**Speaker 2**: I talked to a landscaper that looked into it and said it was really cool and he was going to get it too.
**Jremillard**: Damn.
**Speaker 2**: Oh, it was cool as it shot Topo.
**Speaker 2**: Just based on walking points and setting control points.
**Jremillard**: Yep.
**Speaker 2**: So the meeting tomorrow is also review.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, I just want to go through this with them guys.
**Speaker 2**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: And we'll review those things and then we'll.
**Jremillard**: But like if we can get them down to this 12.2, then I think we're good.
**Speaker 2**: I would think it would be a reasonable conversation that would end up in them apologizing for screwing up the numbers and giving it to us for that.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, I mean, Danny's a friend and like Danny told me over the phone, he's like, I think It'll be about 12 million.
**Jremillard**: So I was like, okay, well, when I seen 14 6, I was like, okay, that's a little more.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: So yeah, we'll just review it with them.
**Jremillard**: We'll clarify insurance, clarify, you know who they think another design person, interior design.
**Jremillard**: And then we'll just go over like all this rooftop.
**Jremillard**: Most of it's going to go away.
**Jremillard**: And when we, you know, we go between that and, you know, just looking at what these buildings should really cost.
**Jremillard**: And he said they're just scrambling to get the number.
**Jremillard**: It's a lot to look at.
**Jremillard**: But like you said, their intern was.
**Jremillard**: Gave it their best shot.
**Speaker 2**: So the old college try.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, but I, I bet they, they split it up between two people.
**Jremillard**: All right.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: One through seven and you've got nine through 12.
**Jremillard**: Go.
**Speaker 2**: And then they were in such a rush to get it out.
**Speaker 2**: Whoever had him do it didn't look at it.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, well, Danny.
**Jremillard**: He didn't even let Danny look at it.
**Jremillard**: That guy Kurt sent it.
**Jremillard**: And because I talked to Danny this morning, he's like, yeah, we'll have that out by tomorrow.
**Jremillard**: And then Brandon's like.
**Jremillard**: I told bclymer that.
**Jremillard**: He's like, you already got it.
**Jremillard**: It's in your email.
**Jremillard**: I'm like, what?
**Jremillard**: So I don't know what's going on over there, but.
**Speaker 2**: This should be an easy conversation.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, cool.
**Jremillard**: All right.
**Jremillard**: We will talk tomorrow.
**Jremillard**: I don't know.
**Jremillard**: We still need to go get through port and then.
**Jremillard**: Did I tell you I'm going to.
**Jremillard**: I gotta move my daughter into an apartment in New Orleans?
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, he said she was driving.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, she's driving.
**Jremillard**: So on Friday I'll be doing that.
**Jremillard**: So I'll be kind of useless for.
**Speaker 2**: Help at work, but I can help if something comes up you need me for.
**Speaker 2**: And then tomorrow I have a meeting at 7am My time for that Harrisburg project.
**Speaker 2**: So it's probably for an hour.
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Speaker 2**: That's all I have other than this Paradise Isle design review meeting.
**Jremillard**: Harrisburg?
**Jremillard**: That's the one with alleatogroup?
**Jremillard**: Yep.
**Jremillard**: Okay, good.
**Speaker 2**: And he and I circled up again this morning, so he's going to ping bclymer and set up an internal chat so we can make sure we fully understand everything that's expected of that and just it looks like it's just a run with it kind of thing.
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: All right, sweet.
**Jremillard**: Cool.
**Jremillard**: Thank you.
**Jremillard**: Talk to you tomorrow.
**Jremillard**: See you.
**Jremillard**: See you, man.
