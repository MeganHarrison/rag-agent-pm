## Transcript
**Gajjeh**: Hey there, folks.
**Gajjeh**: Hey guys.
**Gajjeh**: We'll give it a minute.
**Gajjeh**: I've already talked, had some off, offline conversations, so get these other folks in here.
**Gajjeh**: A.J.
**Gajjeh**: good there.
**Gajjeh**: A.J.
**Gajjeh**: put me on hold.
**Gajjeh**: A.J.
**Gajjeh**: you there?
**Ahogan**: Yep, I'm here.
**Gajjeh**: Yep, I'm here.
**Gajjeh**: Okie doke.
**Gajjeh**: All right, so we probably keep this pretty short, but.
**Gajjeh**: So AJ I've already talked to, we have Gus and Alicia on here from engineering, our engineering team.
**Gajjeh**: I already talked to Josh, our site director, and I got a window to do this shutdown, but I need to understand if team is going to be ready.
**Gajjeh**: So our preference is to start to shut down on Thursday around 4:30.
**Ahogan**: Okay.
**Gajjeh**: Okay.
**Gajjeh**: Now I'm figuring I want to make sure DEEM has all their ducks in a row, right.
**Gajjeh**: Has all the parts, pieces, whatever they need to do that work.
**Gajjeh**: But Thursday after their shift, at 4:30 or 4 o', clock, their shift will end at 4 o'.
**Gajjeh**: Clock.
**Gajjeh**: We'll, we'll shut down our PCs and anything associated with the sorter.
**Ahogan**: Right.
**Gajjeh**: Any of our, any of our equipment.
**Gajjeh**: Right.
**Gajjeh**: We'll shut that down and then around 4:30 they can, you know, we'll give me okay to turn off the switch gear and do their connection.
**Gajjeh**: All right.
**Ahogan**: Yeah, whatever.
**Gajjeh**: Figuring this, I'm only figuring this is an hour or two.
**Gajjeh**: Yeah, I mean they're, they're not landing, you know, large cables here.
**Gajjeh**: I mean, should be pretty straightforward, right?
**Gajjeh**: So I figure I'm two hour window and then we hook things back up and we're back online, right?
**Ahogan**: Yep.
**Ahogan**: Yeah, I mean, two hours, that's great.
**Ahogan**: I, I think we'll be done way quicker than that.
**Gajjeh**: Yeah, I, I can do it in an hour, so.
**Gajjeh**: Just telling me or less no, but yeah, I just want to confirm that with Dean because Gus, you said you talked to William and they weren't sure they had all the parts.
**Jperez**: Yeah, I talked to William, the lead electrician.
**Jperez**: He said they don't have all the parts yet.
**Gajjeh**: Yeah, they'll be right.
**Ahogan**: They'll be ready.
**Ahogan**: I was talking with him, I was talking with him yesterday about it and he asked me when they could so we can at least have it tied in and, and ready to go if we're waiting on any wire or anything.
**Ahogan**: I don't think we are.
**Ahogan**: I was just watching them do it yesterday.
**Ahogan**: So we'll, we'll be ready Thursday.
**Ahogan**: We'll make sure.
**Jperez**: A.J.
**Jperez**: can you say, can you send a communication text or something to JP when you have the pieces here?
**Jperez**: Just to kind of make sure like.
**Jperez**: Yeah, just confirm it when it's all here, please.
**Ahogan**: Yep.
**Ahogan**: I know we're getting an order today.
**Ahogan**: It's got a lot of wire on it for our pit chargers.
**Ahogan**: So if we are waiting on anything, it'll be on that order today.
**Gajjeh**: Yeah, yeah, we'll confirm.
**Gajjeh**: What I'll do is A.J.
**Gajjeh**: and I will make sure that the electrician side, we're all good.
**Gajjeh**: We got any parts and pieces?
**Gajjeh**: I know there's, you know, if there's something on the other end, we need some wire to connect, you know, from the junction box to the chart, whatever it is.
**Gajjeh**: As long as we can do the tie in on Thursday, right.
**Gajjeh**: So we don't have to shut down the switch gear again and then it's just, you know, thrown on a breaker, then we're fine.
**Gajjeh**: But yeah, we'll coordinate that.
**Gajjeh**: Now I'm going to send, I want to.
**Gajjeh**: A.J.
**Gajjeh**: just make sure that.
**Gajjeh**: Then I wanted to send a confirmation email out to this group plus, you know, Gerkey and, and Brad Fury from our team who does, you know, who's involved in the sorter and all that kind of stuff, monitoring and whatnot.
**Gajjeh**: So I want to.
**Gajjeh**: Let's confirm.
**Gajjeh**: Team is good with that time frame.
**Gajjeh**: I'll come, I'll send a confirmation email out tomorrow that we're a go or no go, whatever it is, for 4:30 on Thursday evening.
**Ahogan**: All right, sounds good to me.
**Gajjeh**: I think it should be fairly straightforward.
**Gajjeh**: But just, you know, whenever we shut down, we just want to make sure all of our folks are aware so there's no surprises.
**Gajjeh**: So.
**Gajjeh**: All right, cool.
**Gajjeh**: Any, any, anybody have any other questions, concerns?
**Gajjeh**: All right.
**Gajjeh**: I love meetings like that.
**Gajjeh**: Yeah.
**Ahogan**: All right, see you guys.
**Gajjeh**: All right, I'll see you.
**Gajjeh**: Bye.
