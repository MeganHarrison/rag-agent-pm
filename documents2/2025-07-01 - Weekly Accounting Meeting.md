**Accounting**: But in the meantime, so how are we doing with everything related, you know, finance, accounting?
**Accounting**: Do you guys need anything?
**Bclymer**: I think we went through a lot of the stuff yesterday, so we.
**Bclymer**: We have a weekly accounting meeting that we do before this meeting and kind of walk through all the issues we're having.
**Bclymer**: Whatever we.
**Bclymer**: Experiences with AP ar, you know, credit cards, we do.
**Bclymer**: We do that on Mondays so we can at least get a head start on those before we meet with Brandon on Tuesday.
**Bclymer**: And I think we addressed a lot of the issues yesterday.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Accounting**: Okay, Francie.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so Jose was having issues with the credit cards in notion.
**Bclymer**: Did you.
**Bclymer**: Did you reach out to Megan?
**Jdawson**: No, but what I did is I assigned the manual, the project number and then I can upload it.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, because I have.
**Jdawson**: I have the name.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yes, the project name is there.
**Jdawson**: I fixed it.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Oh, it's uploaded.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay, great.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so I think we can start.
**Bclymer**: We can continue to do that, but I think still reach out to Megan, let her know so she can help us fix that so we can save time and not have to manually do it every time.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I would like your help or something with Megan because She ignores me.
**Bclymer**: Oh, she doesn't respond.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: No, what I mean is in the past I sent six, five emails in, but I got no an answer.
**Jdawson**: So I'm not sure.
**Jdawson**: But maybe if you can help me with.
**Jdawson**: With her.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: I'll reach out to her.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Accounting**: Okay, perfect.
**Accounting**: So.
**Accounting**: And also, Fritz, if you talked to me this morning fixing some stuff for the timesheets and also asking Megan if she can help us with that automation that we can have something else.
**Accounting**: Guys, how are we doing with reconciliations?
**Accounting**: Everything was done.
**Accounting**: Jose on that part.
**Accounting**: All good?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, all good.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Thank you.
**Accounting**: Okay, so that was fixed.
**Accounting**: What else?
**Accounting**: I just sent payroll.
**Accounting**: So just so you know, guys, payroll will be sent out on Thursday since this Friday is July 4th.
**Accounting**: So thank you, Fritzi, for send that already.
**Accounting**: That was already approved and I already talked to the other people because they're missing some payments.
**Accounting**: So we can have that send it out.
**Accounting**: What else, guys, you think we need to talk about anything missing from Jesse Brandon, some documents, anything you guys need.
**Fnjie**: For the calendar.
**Fnjie**: How can we proceed with that?
**Fnjie**: With explanation with Brandon on how are we going to come up with it?
**Accounting**: Right?
**Fnjie**: Like we are going to inform everybody, like for example, for the due date of the pay app and all.
**Fnjie**: And I think we also need to include the timeline for the timesheet that they need to be updated before.
**Bclymer**: Like.
**Fnjie**: Today, when is the payroll.
**Fnjie**: So we also need to have that due date for them to update the per diem and all the reimbursement so that it can be included in the payroll.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Sorry, Maria, go ahead.
**Accounting**: No, no.
**Accounting**: So, okay, so you want me to let the team know on beforehand when the payroll is going to be done.
**Fnjie**: Or not only the payroll, but for the calendar.
**Accounting**: Oh, I know what you meant.
**Bclymer**: The format.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I think we need to do, Maria, similar to what we did where we added reminders on the.
**Bclymer**: On the Aliado calendar or added a task and invite everybody to it.
**Bclymer**: I have a meeting with J See tomorrow to discuss those deadlines in detail.
**Bclymer**: And then I will have dates for you where we update the calendar, you know, throughout the end of the year and say, okay, every month the AR invoices are due by this date.
**Bclymer**: They need to be entered in job planner.
**Bclymer**: They need to be done by this date.
**Bclymer**: For payroll, we can say, okay, the timesheets need to be submitted by a certain date.
**Bclymer**: If payroll is going to be processed on a Thursday, we need it by.
**Bclymer**: By Tuesday.
**Bclymer**: So with that we need to look at the holiday calendar.
**Bclymer**: Know when a holiday will fall On a Friday.
**Bclymer**: If it's a pay week, then we need to move it up.
**Bclymer**: So we will work through all that and I will send the dates to you to add to the calendar and send it basically added as an event to everybody's calendar.
**Bclymer**: Like invite everybody.
**Bclymer**: So every month they see those recurring items.
**Accounting**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: On the calendar.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: And also that's a good idea.
**Accounting**: And also I'm going to send a blast email to all the company saying that they need to be very vigilant on the Alito Group calendar.
**Accounting**: Like, that's gonna be their bible.
**Accounting**: Like, everything that it's on the calendar, it needs to be done by that time.
**Accounting**: So you are not always following up with them, Fritzi.
**Accounting**: Like for example, Jack.
**Accounting**: Like, hey, Jack.
**Accounting**: Hey, Jack.
**Accounting**: No, no, no.
**Accounting**: So Jack, you didn't send it on time.
**Accounting**: So sorry.
**Accounting**: You know, next payroll.
**Accounting**: So it kind of gives them also the idea that they need to be, you know, helpful with you as well.
**Accounting**: So we'll do that once everything is in the calendar.
**Accounting**: So we will send a blast email.
**Accounting**: That's a good idea.
**Accounting**: We'll do that.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And I think on our end, we can also send a monthly.
**Bclymer**: A monthly, you know, like, closing calendar every month.
**Bclymer**: I don't mind sending an email to everybody.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: We are in.
**Bclymer**: We are getting to the end of the month.
**Bclymer**: Air invoices need to be submitted by this date.
**Bclymer**: It's going to be a pay week.
**Bclymer**: We need to send this.
**Bclymer**: I can.
**Bclymer**: We can send out a monthly reminder once a month.
**Bclymer**: But it's really up to them to watch their calendars and make sure that everything is.
**Bclymer**: Is.
**Bclymer**: Is done.
**Accounting**: Yes, I will send them an email saying them read it like the Bible.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Accounting**: If not, forget it.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Accounting**: Awesome.
**Accounting**: Guys.
**Accounting**: What else are we missing?
**Accounting**: Jose, anything on your part that you need from us?
**Jdawson**: No, not at this moment.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Accounting**: Okay, sounds good.
**Accounting**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: And then.
**Accounting**: Well, if you guys don't know me, I'm here if you guys need anything.
**Accounting**: I know Brandon is traveling, but if I can, if you know, he will be probably if I need him urgently, he will reach out to me.
**Accounting**: So just let me know in terms of whatever you guys need.
**Accounting**: But he's traveling.
**Accounting**: He's gonna be on a flight soon as well.
**Accounting**: So just to let you know.
