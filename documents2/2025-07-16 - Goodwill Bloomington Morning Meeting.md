**Jcurtin**: What do you have going on today, Jaz?
**Jdawson**: Today I got electricians that are going to be working on data drops and running their MC cable for their receptors out in the receiving area.
**Jdawson**: I've made it clear and concise with them where the windows are going, so please don't run the conduit there.
**Jdawson**: So that's good to go.
**Jdawson**: And the drops, of course, are between every opening, but when they were going from column to column to not just run it across in the middle of the wall.
**Jdawson**: Framers are continuing to work on the parapet wall and flooring.
**Jdawson**: Guys are continuing to get close to polish.
**Jdawson**: We're looking to apply polish maybe like, come lunchtime tomorrow.
**Jdawson**: On two offices, a break room, and a portion of the back receiving area also have labor here today that's going to be helping scrape up that back area.

**Jdawson**: David said just let him know and he'll swing by because he's in the office today, which isn't too far from here.
**Jdawson**: And David did stop by yesterday thinking that maybe McRae was here, and then just he went over, he gave me a drawing layout like he sketched one of Dow locations, but I was like, I was still.

**Jdawson**: Me and you talked and we're going off the dimension that was given to us on the architecturals.
**Jdawson**: 111 1/2.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I think I told you yesterday.
**Jdawson**: But Paul with garage doors, we talk with him too.
**Jdawson**: So electric, him and electrician are on the same page as far as roughing in power to that dock leveler.
**Jdawson**: And we got down low and looked at where the motor was on the leveler and everything.
**Jdawson**: And Dean has asked garage door for a detail and Paul said he'd get.
**Jdawson**: He'd get him one.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: Is Paul ordering that part?
**Jdawson**: He actually had another one.
**Jdawson**: He had an extra one in the shop.
**Jdawson**: So I didn't.
**Jdawson**: I mean, I didn't.
**Jdawson**: He just said, hey, I happen to have another one.
**Jdawson**: I don't know if that meant okay, hey, I happen to have another one.
**Jdawson**: And this is how much it's going to cost you.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: But either way it's good.
**Jcurtin**: He.
**Jcurtin**: He has one.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: No, we.
**Jdawson**: I was glad about that.
**Jdawson**: And then Dean's gonna get another disconnect ordered as well.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: When is the roofer going to start on the canopy?
**Jdawson**: He's supposed to be starting tomorrow, which Griffin has made.
**Jdawson**: He's on the north side now.
**Jdawson**: So he's framed up the south side, framed up the east side and framed up the north side.
**Jdawson**: He's finish up today.
**Jdawson**: I had him on schedule to do it Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.
**Jdawson**: So they've been showing up one an.
**Jdawson**: An extra hour early to make sure they get it done in three days.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Good.
**Jcurtin**: Is there anything you need from me or any information you.
**Jdawson**: Oh, just I had a draft rfi, but just so we're all on the same page, that it's okay for me to locate the donation Dropbox on the right side of the opening.
**Jdawson**: The dimensions fit.
**Jdawson**: I just wanted to make sure that that was okay to put it on the right side.
**Jdawson**: I was going to get a picture on there, standing back, looking.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: Is that.
**Jcurtin**: How far away from the door is that going to be?
**Jdawson**: If.
**Jdawson**: Let me pull a tape on that and make sure.
**Jdawson**: If we center it in between the edge of the column and the door, then that'll be a plan.
**Jcurtin**: Right.
**Jcurtin**: I can send that then to Andrew and see if he's okay with that.
**Jdawson**: Okay, sweet.
**Jdawson**: I'll get you a picture.
**Jdawson**: And I did message and email Andrew yesterday about the baby changing stations, toilet paper holder, soap dispensers, and that Donation Dropbox for those first three things, he's going to have to pallet them in there.
**Jdawson**: I may end up having to push him off another week because for him to pallet jacket into the building.
**Jdawson**: He wanted to go through the front doors, of course, but McRae and then wasn't going to pour that sidewalk until they pour the footings.
**Jdawson**: So I'll reach back out to Andrew today and just have him scheduled for early next week for all that stuff to be dropped off.
**Jcurtin**: Are they framing the ceiling on the, on the canopy?
**Jdawson**: That material has been ordered, but it hasn't arrived yet.
**Jdawson**: Okay, that's a Griffin.
**Jdawson**: Let me know.
**Jdawson**: Last week it was about a, a week.
**Jdawson**: A week duration on when we were going to get it.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: Are you all, all good then today?
**Jcurtin**: Today?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah, yeah, all good.
**Ksipe**: What does your schedule look like currently.
**Jdawson**: Here?
**Jcurtin**: I, I have it pulled up, Jack.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: I was on the team's calling my phone.
**Jcurtin**: This is what's the loading dock.
**Jdawson**: Will.
**Jcurtin**: Will be at the end of August.
**Jcurtin**: As long as we stay on track and then Goodwill, we'll.
**Jcurtin**: We'll be able to move in.
**Ksipe**: Where are we at right now?
**Ksipe**: Like what's happened today?
**Jcurtin**: Go ahead, Jack.
**Jdawson**: No, you either one of us.
**Jdawson**: I mean for each section, what's going on today on the dock door area would be McRae and them forming and pouring new footings in the stem wall.
**Jdawson**: And then if you scroll up some more, installing the sales rep that did happen Friday.
**Jdawson**: Yesterday the trimming out of the sales wrap did get completed.
**Jdawson**: Contractor paint touch up will take place tomorrow.
**Jdawson**: And then if you scroll up a little bit more, this is the sales, the office and restroom.
**Jdawson**: So if you scroll down a little bit, grind and polish.
**Jdawson**: Two offices in a break room.
**Jdawson**: Instead of him being completed today, he's going to apply the polish tomorrow.
**Jdawson**: So it was one day longer than expected.
**Jdawson**: And then after that, final paint will go into the two offices, break room and bathroom.
**Jdawson**: So with.
**Jdawson**: With him not finished until till Thursday, I'm going to have the painter starting the sales for Thursday and then they'll move into those rooms on Friday.
**Ksipe**: Okay, scroll down.
**Ksipe**: I mean slow up.
**Ksipe**: I called it.
**Ksipe**: I just want to look at all these things that aren't green.
**Ksipe**: They're finishing framing of the canopy today.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, they'll finish framing the parapet wall today.
**Ksipe**: What about the columns and the.
**Jdawson**: Not, not the columns, but at least the roof.
**Jdawson**: Like the, just the parapet wall so that the roofer could come in and do his, his thing.
**Ksipe**: So next week.
**Ksipe**: Yeah, there's a demo in the alley.
**Jdawson**: Yes, Is they.
**Ksipe**: Do they have a survey or do they.
**Ksipe**: Are they getting one?
**Jcurtin**: We would.
**Jcurtin**: We would have to get one if we need one.
**Ksipe**: Is that in their scope to lay that out, or do we got to stake it?
**Jcurtin**: They.
**Jcurtin**: They excluded all surveying.
**Ksipe**: Has that been done already, Jack?
**Jdawson**: What?
**Jdawson**: Surveying?
**Ksipe**: Yeah, for where that alley goes.
**Jdawson**: No, not yet.
**Ksipe**: Well, if they're starting Monday the 17th.
**Ksipe**: No, they're starting Thursday.
**Ksipe**: No, Monday the 21st.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Ksipe**: You better put that call in this morning.
**Jdawson**: I will.
**Jdawson**: Well, and I haven't.
**Jdawson**: I got another.
**Jdawson**: Another talk with.
**Jdawson**: With.
**Jdawson**: With Rick.
**Jdawson**: Because when I gave him that date of Monday the 21st on last week's subcontractor meeting, he said maybe so.
**Jdawson**: He said he would.
**Jdawson**: He said he would know more come.
**Jdawson**: When he mobilizes to do the footings is when he'll be able to lock in, because he wanted to be able to do.
**Ksipe**: Isn't he here doing the footings?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, he's here this week doing the footings.
**Ksipe**: Well, when Monday shows up, you can say here, everything's staked out.
**Ksipe**: You can get started.
**Jdawson**: Right on.
**Ksipe**: Just make sure when he's demoing he doesn't knock him out.
**Jdawson**: Got you.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And I'll.
**Jdawson**: And also, I'll coordinate with Aldi's to let them know when exactly that's going to be taking place.
**Ksipe**: So they're framing everything after the pavement.
**Ksipe**: Is there a reason they can't just frame it this week?
**Jdawson**: What?
**Jdawson**: The.
**Jdawson**: The ceiling?
**Ksipe**: Mm.
**Jdawson**: They don't have the material yet.
**Jdawson**: When Griffin ordered it late last week, and he said that those studs that they need for that, given how long they're going to be, it's a special order, and it takes a week of a turnaround to come in.
**Jdawson**: So if Rick doesn't hold up his end of the bargain with the asphalt, then I'll just continue to be working Griffin in that area and say, okay, well, I'm still not asphalt in the parking lot, so just now work on the ceiling.
**Ksipe**: Those lifts will tear up new pavement, so it'd be better if they got in there and did it anyways.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Right on.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: Well, I said I'll.
**Jdawson**: I'll.
**Jdawson**: I'll make adjustments for that.
**Ksipe**: We'd have them in there Monday morning or.
**Ksipe**: When is the framing getting here Last time they ordered it so late.
**Jdawson**: Good question.
**Jdawson**: But it's supposedly supposed to be here tomorrow or Friday.
**Ksipe**: And how are they going to fix the columns?
**Ksipe**: Do you have a written direction for that?
**Jdawson**: That's what I'm going over with Rick today.
**Jdawson**: Again.
**Ksipe**: Last time you have A written RFI on it?
**Jdawson**: No, because I, I was.
**Jdawson**: I mean, the RFI would just basically be about right now, would be a draft saying, hey, going to be planning this out with Rick.
**Ksipe**: Well, what is your plan, though?
**Jcurtin**: Well, we.
**Jcurtin**: Me and Jack, we.
**Jcurtin**: We talked about it, and then Jack.
**Jcurtin**: Well, when Rick mobilizes to do his footings, then Jack was gonna go meet with him and go over it, and then.
**Jcurtin**: Well, we would come up with the final direction.
**Ksipe**: But do you have to sketch something up?
**Ksipe**: You have no idea what we're doing.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, we'll.
**Jcurtin**: We'll do that after we talk with Rick.
**Jcurtin**: It seemed like Rick had.
**Jcurtin**: Well, I think we're gonna have to slope it up a little bit.
**Jcurtin**: And that's how Rick explained that he could do it when.
**Jcurtin**: When he was on site, but we won't.
**Jcurtin**: We're going to go over it with him again today.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Ksipe**: Who'S doing the landscaping?
**Jcurtin**: The landscaping?
**Jcurtin**: I don't have anyone contracted for landscaping.
**Ksipe**: We're starting it in 10 days.
**Ksipe**: So what are we going to do?
**Ksipe**: Do we even have a landscape plan?
**Ksipe**: Is it sod?
**Ksipe**: Do we have a budget for it?
**Jdawson**: No.
**Jcurtin**: It's something I guess I didn't think about.
**Ksipe**: If it's just grass, who gives a.
**Ksipe**: Some mulch?
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: What.
**Jcurtin**: What all needs to be landscape.
**Jcurtin**: Jack.
**Jdawson**: Pull up the plan.
**Jdawson**: I mean, on the building right now, it could use a fresh new mulch job.
**Jdawson**: I know that for sure.
**Jdawson**: Like, there's no question.
**Jdawson**: I don't know if Andrew and them wanted plants or something on this east side of the building.
**Ksipe**: Just mulch.
**Jdawson**: Just mulch.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I mean, it could use a new mulch job.
**Jcurtin**: Where?
**Jcurtin**: In this area?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: Is this, Is this the only area right here?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that's the only area.
**Jdawson**: Mulch.
**Jdawson**: Because on the, on the front of the building over on the part that's like kind of shared with Aldi's, that's just grass over there that gets cut by.
**Jdawson**: That's been getting cut by somebody.
**Jdawson**: And then on the backside, you know, just after we finish the alley work back there.
**Jdawson**: I don't think that's Goodwill's property on the other side of the alley, so we don't have to worry about that.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Back on that side, I don't know if they.
**Jdawson**: If they want fresh new rock or we're down, we're extending.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Ksipe**: So I don't.
**Jdawson**: What's.
**Jdawson**: Has Goodwill mentioned anything about one.
**Jdawson**: Anything specific back there?
**Jcurtin**: Just anything we tear up, we will.
**Jcurtin**: We would have to fix.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jcurtin**: So we'll look at it, though.
**Jcurtin**: The mulch.
**Jcurtin**: Do you think they just have bags at, like, Home Depot?
**Ksipe**: Yeah, yeah, I got.
**Jdawson**: Bags at Home Depot.
**Ksipe**: Just get with the property management guy you've been talking to and ask them what kind of mulch do they want put back.
**Ksipe**: Did we.
**Ksipe**: We just took the curve out.
**Ksipe**: That's it, right?
**Ksipe**: To adjust the height of it.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Ksipe**: Just ask them what kind of mulch.
**Ksipe**: That's all.
**Ksipe**: It's easy.
**Jdawson**: Talking about right where we're at.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Ksipe**: All right, back to the schedule.
**Ksipe**: Who's got the schedule?
**Jdawson**: What.
**Ksipe**: Someone going to share the schedule?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I can share.
**Jdawson**: You got them there.
**Ksipe**: Like, we skipped over a bunch of stuff.
**Ksipe**: Where's the sod or the landscape thing you muted, Nick?
**Jcurtin**: I said, I suppose we can save some days with the landscape and the metal framing.
**Ksipe**: I'd get them in there next week or the end of this week, frame all that up.
**Ksipe**: I would have them working getting all that done.
**Ksipe**: That way, if your pavement guy's late, it'll be better for you.
**Ksipe**: Have all that done.
**Ksipe**: Do you have another inspection called in for that?
**Ksipe**: Are you gonna schedule that for a rough in for the canopy?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I don't have to have another one for that.
**Jdawson**: And then I was going to team it up with.
**Jdawson**: When they come and look at the donation vestibule that they look at the above ceiling or like the.
**Jdawson**: The ceiling of the canopy as well.
**Jcurtin**: We were going to call in a reinforcement inspection for the footings.
**Jcurtin**: Go see.
**Ksipe**: Oh, yeah.
**Ksipe**: Same thing you did for the canopy.
**Ksipe**: All right.
**Ksipe**: And where's the.
**Ksipe**: Is there a roof activity for the new truck?
**Ksipe**: Loading dock.
**Ksipe**: And they gotta put EFIs.
**Ksipe**: The gutter back on.
**Ksipe**: And the edge of the roof isn't all tore off.
**Jdawson**: Reinstall existing gutters and downspouts up a little bit higher.
**Jdawson**: We.
**Jcurtin**: We have an EPIS task on this.
**Jdawson**: What's that?
**Ksipe**: Yeah, can move it so fast, I can't see a frame ceiling rough and lights and sprinkler shading.
**Ksipe**: And then there's no EFIs.
**Jcurtin**: We'll have to put a task in there for that.
**Jdawson**: Jack.
**Jdawson**: For EFIs?
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, at the loading dock ceiling.
**Jdawson**: I thought I if scroll up.
**Jcurtin**: Well, it would be after shaving.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we'll add that back.
**Jcurtin**: Is there anything else you guys wanted to look at?
**Ksipe**: Yeah.
**Ksipe**: What's the rest of it?
**Ksipe**: What's the end of the schedule?
**Ksipe**: To go slow, like.
**Jcurtin**: God, Nick, you said the end is all of this.
**Ksipe**: So we looked at this already.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: This is the canopy.
**Jcurtin**: This is the storage area.
**Ksipe**: What's this?
**Jcurtin**: The storage area?
**Ksipe**: So grinding, polishing floor.
**Ksipe**: What about all the activities to add the new windows?
**Jcurtin**: Oh, that is on there.
**Jcurtin**: If you look at task 123, isn't.
**Ksipe**: All that plywood up and done?
**Ksipe**: Is that plywood in the donation vestibule?
**Jdawson**: What was your question?
**Ksipe**: We have conduit drops and you have grind polished floor.
**Ksipe**: You got the power sliding doors, an air curtain, ceiling grid.
**Ksipe**: The ceiling grid's not in.
**Ksipe**: And the donation vestibule.
**Jdawson**: No.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Ksipe**: Aren't the walls down in there?
**Ksipe**: They're just plywood, aren't they?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, but there's, there's electrical inside the walls and I was going to get that inspected with the top of the canopy.
**Jdawson**: So we haven't closed in those walls.
**Jdawson**: They're just one sided with drywall on the outside.
**Ksipe**: Okay.
**Ksipe**: How come the window guy told us four to five weeks he would do it?
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, that's what he said he placed the order with for the windows and now he's waiting to hear back from the supplier for an actual date.
**Ksipe**: But he knows.
**Ksipe**: He's confident it was four to five weeks?
**Jcurtin**: He was when we first talked to him.
**Jcurtin**: Yes.
**Ksipe**: Okay, scroll down a little more.
**Ksipe**: Aren't they already painting all that stuff in the back or they are going to wait till then?
**Jdawson**: What all the CMU and plywood chair rail?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jdawson**: I was gonna get the flooring guy in there first because he's gonna finish up the area he's at now this week.
**Jdawson**: So then I'll be able to keep him moving and he can continue on next week with what he's doing because he's already going to have to, he's going to already have to remobilize once we come and do that back.
**Jdawson**: Receiving area back by the dock door.
**Ksipe**: Jack.
**Ksipe**: What you're doing here though, like you're putting.
**Ksipe**: The only thing that should be out there at 8:25 is those new windows.
**Ksipe**: Like everything else needs to be done or else you're going to be doing a whole bunch of shit.
**Ksipe**: When they want to move in and the windows.
**Ksipe**: The only thing we got to explain why we're being late.
**Jdawson**: Well like if, if they come and do all the framing and so if they do all the framing and then do the windows and then they beat up the walls and then the painter already puts final paint on those walls.
**Jdawson**: His touch up, he has to repaint whole areas.
**Jdawson**: Inline has already told me that they are going to charge us so they recommended we wait.
**Ksipe**: But you're, that's the end of the month.
**Ksipe**: You're out of time versus Having a guy go in there for a day and touch up walls.
**Jdawson**: As.
**Jdawson**: I mean it just depends on how much they do.
**Jdawson**: They work clean.
**Jdawson**: While they're doing all this framing and installing windows.
**Jdawson**: Are they going to get stuff?
**Jdawson**: Because Inline has already said like they're.
**Jdawson**: They're not.
**Jdawson**: If, if it's a lot of touch up, they're just going to paint the wall and charge us for having to repaint.
**Jdawson**: Like they're.
**Jdawson**: That's.
**Jdawson**: That was there.
**Ksipe**: Where.
**Ksipe**: What is 8:25?
**Ksipe**: What is 8:28?
**Ksipe**: What day of the week is that?
**Ksipe**: Thursday?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Ksipe**: Why are we grinding floors to the 22nd?
**Jdawson**: So after the dock door area has been done and completed, then they can go back over there and that.
**Ksipe**: When's the mace.
**Ksipe**: When's the masonry stop?
**Ksipe**: Like when that mason wall is done.
**Ksipe**: Just finish all grinding and polishing of floors.
**Ksipe**: Like when is that masonry wall supposed to be done?
**Jdawson**: Masonry wall right now is supposed to be done August 4th.
**Jdawson**: But the.
**Ksipe**: But like that's such.
**Ksipe**: They've been out there forever.
**Ksipe**: That's such a long activity.
**Ksipe**: Like they.
**Ksipe**: I mean, I don't know how I know they take up a little space, but somehow you gotta just make them be finished.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Ksipe**: On August 4th, all they have left to do is polish around the new walls in the loading dock area and get the out of there.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: And.
**Jdawson**: But any, any new concrete that's poured over there, like any new slab, I'm gonna have to get an adhesive in it to help it cure.
**Jdawson**: 7 days or else they can't start grinding it yet.
**Ksipe**: They're gonna have a tiny little part around the wall and.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: That puts.
**Ksipe**: All I'm saying is we can be in there touching up paint.
**Ksipe**: We can be in there doing a lot of little things.
**Ksipe**: But polishing concrete floors we can't do when they move in there.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Ksipe**: So you gotta think about that.
**Ksipe**: Like things like that.
**Ksipe**: Then you're done in the out of there.
**Ksipe**: I think we're all.
**Ksipe**: Where we.
**Ksipe**: We were only dryfall painting the front retail section.
**Ksipe**: Right.
**Ksipe**: We're not painting any ceilings in the back.
**Jdawson**: No.
**Ksipe**: True statement.
**Jdawson**: No.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Ksipe**: Like what else do you have left to do that they couldn't be in there open while we do it?
**Jdawson**: What else.
**Jdawson**: What else is there to do that we could be doing while they're open and like operational?
**Jdawson**: Is that your question?
**Ksipe**: No, I'm saying there's things on your schedule that have to be done.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Ksipe**: For them for us to get a TCO and for them to move in there.
**Ksipe**: Canopies done.
**Ksipe**: Pavements Done.
**Ksipe**: Walls are done, concrete polishing's done.
**Ksipe**: And then look at everything else on that schedule.
**Ksipe**: Exterior episode, around the window, doesn't matter.
**Ksipe**: And those are the things.
**Ksipe**: If anything's going to slip out towards the end of the month and could possibly not be done, needs to be those things.
**Ksipe**: Everything that's going to keep them from opening up, no matter what, is what has to be done by the middle of August, not the end of August, so we can confidently get a TCO and know they're going to move in.
**Ksipe**: And you need to plan on right now getting a TCO.
**Jdawson**: 10, 4.
**Ksipe**: You want to scroll down some more, Nick?
**Ksipe**: What else is left on here?
**Ksipe**: I mean, I would get your fire marshal inspection.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Ksipe**: Well, as soon as the walls are done for the loading dock and the slabs poured back.
**Jdawson**: Gotcha.
**Ksipe**: I mean, canopy should be done.
**Ksipe**: Like, everything should be done.
**Jdawson**: Inlines.
**Jdawson**: Inline's gonna have a charge coming to them.
**Jdawson**: When fire sprinkler guys remobilize on site to finish up in the.
**Jdawson**: In the rooms on Friday.
**Jdawson**: I've told them today that I'll finish the count on the sales floor.
**Jdawson**: The sprinkler heads.
**Jdawson**: So far, I've got about half the.
**Jdawson**: Half the floor done of counting and.
**Jdawson**: And running orange ribbon up high.
**Jdawson**: Of what?
**Jdawson**: Sprinkler heads got paint on them.
**Jdawson**: Because that will fail the fire marshal inspection if he sees paint on these heads.
**Jdawson**: So when they were dry, did they not cover them?
**Ksipe**: Like, what the hell?
**Jdawson**: They did.
**Jdawson**: They did.
**Jdawson**: And I guess they just didn't cover them that well, but they did cover them.
**Ksipe**: Is it paint or is it tape to paint them to?
**Jcurtin**: It's.
**Jdawson**: It's paint.
**Jdawson**: I got a picture of just about every single one I've tagged so far.
**Jdawson**: How many are there so far?
**Jdawson**: We're at about 10.
**Ksipe**: But other than that, like, your fire sprinkler's active, the fire alarm's active.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Ksipe**: I don't know if there's like, get the fire marshal in there as soon as that canopy's up.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we.
**Jdawson**: We.
**Jdawson**: CSE is pushing finish up their.
**Jdawson**: All their strobes and everything out on the sales floor.
**Jdawson**: And I work with csc and we actually had like, a. CSC brought out somebody with the fire association in the town and gave, like, a courtesy walk with CSC to just go over a couple things and things like that.
**Jdawson**: So, yeah, it will bring that home.
**Jdawson**: CSC knows what date I need them done, which they're.
**Jdawson**: They're pretty far ahead because they were.
**Jdawson**: They were planning as if for us to get the TCO like first or second week of July, so they're.
**Jdawson**: They're pretty far ahead.
**Jdawson**: But I. I'll watch my words when I say that and not jinx it.
**Ksipe**: Go.
**Ksipe**: You just need to have that on your list.
**Ksipe**: Focus on making sure everything you can get early.
**Ksipe**: You do.
**Jdawson**: 10, four.
**Ksipe**: Because like, if you could get a TCO as soon as that back, you know, we got it phased.
**Ksipe**: And even if you're ready in the front, is the sidewalk poured back?
**Jdawson**: No, that's not poured back.
**Jdawson**: Rick wants to pour that.
**Jdawson**: Once he pours the footings on the back side of the building.
**Ksipe**: Why don't we tear that up?
**Ksipe**: Why did he tear it up when he did.
**Jdawson**: What's up?
**Jdawson**: Why did.
**Jdawson**: Oh, why did he start tearing it up?
**Ksipe**: Well, why did he tear it up and then leave it open for a month?
**Jdawson**: Well, we were gonna start.
**Jdawson**: We.
**Jdawson**: We tore it up.
**Jdawson**: He was already late.
**Ksipe**: Never mind.
**Ksipe**: Never mind.
**Ksipe**: It's.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we had to rush the EFIS guy in and then the ethis guy was working over top of it, so then Rick couldn't come back and pour it.
**Jdawson**: And when originally when Rick was supposed to come.
**Ksipe**: What do we got?
**Ksipe**: Where's the date for the can for the new.
**Ksipe**: Have we got a price for the new awnings?
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, I do have a price.
**Ksipe**: Do we have a total.
**Ksipe**: What is the total for the windows and.
**Jcurtin**: The framing?
**Jcurtin**: I'm still waiting on that number.
**Jcurtin**: And the EFIs?
**Jcurtin**: I'm waiting on that number.
**Ksipe**: And I told Andrew, you know, just because we missed coordinating this, we weren't going to put any fee on this change order.
**Ksipe**: So when you put it there, just make it a no fee.
**Ksipe**: But we need to.
**Ksipe**: You got lead dates or lead times.
**Jdawson**: On all of it?
**Ksipe**: If we ordered the awnings or they quick to get.
**Jcurtin**: They're quick.
**Jcurtin**: Again.
**Ksipe**: We just need to verify the heights before we make sure that the right height before we order them.
**Ksipe**: Who's doing the paint of the Goodwill.
**Jcurtin**: Blue that we have a price from inline, but we're finalizing a pain plan with.
**Jcurtin**: Because the front it's not inset.
**Jcurtin**: The.
**Jcurtin**: The EFIs is flat.
**Jcurtin**: So Andrew still needs to talk to his.
**Jcurtin**: His designer.
**Ksipe**: Okay.
**Ksipe**: But that's an extra because it was going to be his signage people doing that paint.
**Ksipe**: Or do we always.
**Ksipe**: That paint is an extra.
**Jcurtin**: Well, it's it.
**Jcurtin**: I think we should have had paint in our quote.
**Ksipe**: Well, does it say anything on the drawings paint?
**Jcurtin**: No, the drawings don't say pain.
**Ksipe**: Okay, well, if we're close to.
**Ksipe**: We got all the Contingencies still left in this job, isn't it?
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, the paint was like 7,000.
**Ksipe**: So we use some of that.
**Ksipe**: Maybe we make it 1.
**Ksipe**: Change order and use contingency to cover as much of the windows and the paint as possible.
**Ksipe**: What is it, 25,000?
**Jcurtin**: The windows were 32,000, but the contingency is 25.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, I believe so.
**Ksipe**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jcurtin**: So are we just going to use the contingency for.
**Jcurtin**: Just use the contingency and then we cover the rest, or do you want.
**Ksipe**: No, no contingency and then whatever the balance is is to goodwill.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Ksipe**: Because I mean, it's.
**Ksipe**: We're adding value to their projects.
**Ksipe**: Not like we screwed up and if we had to tear them out and put windows right back in, that would.
**Jdawson**: Have been a problem.
**Ksipe**: But this.
**Ksipe**: We tore out the windows they didn't want and we put them in windows because they'd have been required regardless.
**Ksipe**: I saw you see Jared's email on Tremont.
**Ksipe**: So that thing's going to start.
**Ksipe**: So we need to get.
**Ksipe**: Get with DKRG about doing those drawings for permit, since we'll need a permit.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Ksipe**: So just send them what we have and say, hey, how much to get these as a permit set?
**Ksipe**: I believe.
**Ksipe**: Didn't Glenmark include the engineering of the floor system as a delegated design or do we have to have that designed?
**Jcurtin**: I think they.
**Jcurtin**: They didn't include design.
**Ksipe**: So look into that because the.
**Ksipe**: If the architect needs to throw in a little structural design for that mezzanine, there's no plumbing.
**Ksipe**: De will do their own electrical drawings.
**Ksipe**: We're not even doing.
**Ksipe**: Yeah, and so there's another thing.
**Ksipe**: Just tell.
**Ksipe**: We got to get with them.
**Ksipe**: And because they're hiring their own H Vac people, they're hiring, you know, the electricians working directly for them.
**Ksipe**: There's a lot of subs working directly for them.
**Ksipe**: So I would.
**Ksipe**: We just need to set up a time to coordinate.
**Ksipe**: I'm gonna call Andrew after we get off this call.
**Ksipe**: Anyways, talked about him a couple other things, so.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Sa.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: And this email with Jared.
**Ksipe**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: He said if.
**Jcurtin**: If we haven't re.
**Jcurtin**: Received communication from the city and he was going to reach out to the mayor.
**Jcurtin**: We.
**Jcurtin**: We did get communication is revising per their comments.
**Jcurtin**: Yes.
**Jcurtin**: And who sent me an email.
**Jcurtin**: They were trying.
**Jcurtin**: So these are some comments.
**Jcurtin**: This is the response to.
**Jcurtin**: To.
**Jdawson**: The engineer.
**Ksipe**: Send it to that Ashton guy or the other, the one that sent us the comments.
**Ksipe**: His review.
**Ksipe**: Send this email to him and ask him, hey, is this something that we can get an alternate on before we go through, because Goodwill does not want to.
**Jdawson**: Hey, did y' all have anything else to run by with me about Bloomington or any questions or anything?
**Jdawson**: I just got some guys that are.
**Jdawson**: I got questions that are standing by the car, so if not, I was gonna hop in here.
**Jcurtin**: I don't have any, too.
**Ksipe**: That.
**Ksipe**: All right, we'll see you, Jack.
**Ksipe**: Just concentrate on all those things.
**Ksipe**: Just think about nothing that you want to be able to have a TCO by mid August, and you want anything.
**Ksipe**: They could move in on mid August to get started, and we're not going to keep them from doing anything.
**Ksipe**: It would just be a matter of finishing touches here and there.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: All right, will do.
**Ksipe**: All right, See you.
**Ksipe**: All right.
**Jdawson**: Thank you.
