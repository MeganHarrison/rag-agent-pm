## Transcript
**Ataylor**: Hi Brandon.
**Ataylor**: Hey, how you doing?
**Bclymer**: Well, how are you?
**Ataylor**: Good.
**Ataylor**: Hi to your puppy as well.
**Bclymer**: He says hey.
**Ataylor**: Do you want to wait for Maria or do you want to just.
**Bclymer**: Okay, we can get started.
**Ataylor**: So we're going to go over the August content today.
**Ataylor**: July wrapped up nicely.
**Ataylor**: We got everything scheduled which is great.
**Ataylor**: Scroll to the bottom here.
**Ataylor**: But you can see that we have a couple things planned.
**Ataylor**: This footage we already have.
**Ataylor**: And then if you and Maria are able to schedule and film the internal Q and A with you, then we'll have some content for the rest of the month as well.
**Ataylor**: And then I want to identify what create partner you'd like to spotlight this month.
**Bclymer**: Okay, yeah, I'll do the Q and A this week.
**Ataylor**: Great.
**Ataylor**: Awesome.
**Ataylor**: Thank you.
**Ataylor**: So this first post, the anatomy of a build with healthcare Savanna Miba healthcare bills.
**Ataylor**: This is just what I was able to come up with some with some research and AI.
**Ataylor**: So let me know if anything is not applicable to Alito.
**Ataylor**: Oh, hold on, I'm going to let Maria in.
**Ataylor**: Okay, so first one is airflow and infection control.
**Ataylor**: Precision H vac matters.
**Ataylor**: We design airflow zones.
**Ataylor**: HEPA filters and negative filter in every plan.
**Ataylor**: Prevent this heat and backup.
**Ataylor**: Power care can't stop so neither can the power.
**Ataylor**: Backup systems and fail safes are non negotiable.
**Ataylor**: Speed without sacrifice.
**Ataylor**: Tight timelines don't scare us.
**Ataylor**: We build fast but always by book.
**Ataylor**: And then this is where precision matters most.
**Ataylor**: In health care.
**Ataylor**: Every detail serves purpose.
**Ataylor**: You bring the experience for daishan and speed to get it done right start to finish.
**Ataylor**: And then here is the caption.
**Ataylor**: Now does that sound like how you would want to talk about a healthcare bill?
**Bclymer**: I need to ask Jesse what he thinks.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: He's both more hospitals than I have.
**Ataylor**: Gotcha.
**Ataylor**: Okay, so I'll send this to you specifically in an email so that you can, if you want I can tag Jesse or you can support forward it to him, whatever you prefer.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, just send it and you can include Jesse.
**Ataylor**: Okay, great.
**Ataylor**: Okay, so this is will be Andrew's on site video with him speaking on camera and having his name show up a little more like we chatted about Maria.
**Bclymer**: Didn't you already make that video?
**Bclymer**: Isn't that what you just posted Maria.
**Ataylor**: For Andrew?
**Jdawson**: Yes, because I didn't have the downloadable link only until Friday.
**Jdawson**: So we just posted the one from Andrew.
**Ataylor**: Oh, okay.
**Ataylor**: And the one that.
**Jdawson**: Can you scroll back up Anika, just to see is the video that we just posted.
**Jdawson**: Correct.
**Jdawson**: That was the one from Andrew.
**Ataylor**: The one on LinkedIn or on the Other platforms.
**Jdawson**: Instagram.
**Ataylor**: On Instagram.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: Since you didn't have the downloadable link, it's a different one.
**Ataylor**: I was going to edit together a different video, but I can use the exact one you made for Instagram if you like.
**Jdawson**: No, but wait, so we agree that we're going to have more content related to what Brandon did.
**Jdawson**: Correct.
**Jdawson**: So we have the one from the Westfield like on the side and then he actually talking like he looking at the camera.
**Jdawson**: So I can.
**Jdawson**: He already have that video for the challenges.
**Jdawson**: So that's good.
**Jdawson**: So we have more videos with Andrew, but that's fine.
**Ataylor**: Yes.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, it looks like that the video is the same.
**Jdawson**: Yes, it's the same one.
**Jdawson**: Correct.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: So yes, the.
**Ataylor**: That's the one that was him speaking for the video.
**Ataylor**: This other video is going to be him on camera along with some other footage edited in.
**Jdawson**: Yes, I think that's awesome.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, So I will send that one over.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: So.
**Ataylor**: So this is a short build when.
**Ataylor**: Or short post when you build for retail.
**Ataylor**: It's just.
**Ataylor**: Just a photo and a caption.
**Ataylor**: So it's kind of like the healthcare build, but focused more on retail and a little more condensed.
**Bclymer**: Is that picture supposed to be the job?
**Ataylor**: Yes, this was in the.
**Ataylor**: I have this under Goodwill Bloomington.
**Ataylor**: If that is correct, I can change the photo.
**Ataylor**: If this is not Goodwill Bloomington, where.
**Bclymer**: Are we getting these?
**Bclymer**: Like, you know, like that isn't.
**Bclymer**: So if I go into the Goodwill Bloomington job and I look at photos, you tell me that pictures in there.
**Ataylor**: That's where I got this originally.
**Ataylor**: But I had this saved in Canva under Bloomington.
**Ataylor**: So if it's possible, we have had the instance in the past where a photo in the folder was not the right build.
**Ataylor**: So that's something to note.
**Bclymer**: I mean, I'm looking in the job folder.
**Bclymer**: I don't see that photo anywhere.
**Ataylor**: Right.
**Ataylor**: I pulled this one from Canva.
**Ataylor**: So I have it under the wrong name.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, that's.
**Bclymer**: It looks like that's Goodwill.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: What was it called?
**Bclymer**: Goodwill.
**Bclymer**: Anyway, it's a warehouse on the east side.
**Ataylor**: Okay, gotcha.
**Ataylor**: So if you like the photo we can.
**Ataylor**: I mean, the Goodwill Bloomington is just a hashtag.
**Ataylor**: So if it's a different location, we can just swap out the location and the.
**Ataylor**: And the.
**Ataylor**: The name here and it.
**Ataylor**: It'll still apply, especially if it's a warehouse.
**Ataylor**: I can add that into the caption.
**Ataylor**: We just got to confirm what the actual location.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I mean the thing is like that picture is a.
**Bclymer**: Is from a Goodwill that I did before I started Alito.
**Bclymer**: So, I mean, it's like from point 19.
**Ataylor**: Oh.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So, you know, I don't know.
**Bclymer**: Maria, you want to go through the job folder and you get, you know, some good pictures or whatever.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Annika, you do have access to these folders, correct?
**Jdawson**: Just want to make sure when I'm sharing with you, you can see them, right?
**Ataylor**: Yeah, yeah, you can see it here.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: That's good.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: If you go to the 2024.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So the Bloomington, I'll pick ones and then I'll send them to you, the good ones.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Okay, I'll do that for Bloomington.
**Ataylor**: Okay, perfect.
**Ataylor**: Just crush that one.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Oops.
**Ataylor**: Okay, that sounds good.
**Ataylor**: This post for August 13th is day one priorities on any job site.
**Ataylor**: So five that picked our secure site access.
**Ataylor**: So set up job box and trailer post safety signage, verify utilities, establish comps.
**Ataylor**: Is this what you would consider day one priorities, or would you like to change anything?
**Bclymer**: I mean, what's the purpose of this post?
**Ataylor**: This would, I mean, just to incite a.
**Ataylor**: An understanding that Alito is on top of, like, regimented practices at each job site and then get someone to reach out to work on a project.
**Ataylor**: So it's just about Alito's reliability.
**Bclymer**: I don't see that when I read that.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: I mean, yeah, I mean, yeah, I guess, you know, that stuff all happens, you know, I mean, you.
**Bclymer**: I mean, ideally, you're verifying utilities a little bit before, but.
**Bclymer**: Sure, yeah, I guess I just, you know, reading that, I'm like, all right, what's the purpose?
**Bclymer**: Like, are we just like.
**Bclymer**: And if it's like, well, anything is better than nothing, like, okay, you know, it's like, I feel like we could come up with something that is, you know, has a little bit more.
**Bclymer**: Either more meat to it or, like, is more relevant or some sort of call to action.
**Bclymer**: Not just like, oh, here, like, we're just saying things that are, you know, like, oh, everybody's got to wake up in the morning.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, that's it.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Okay, so this is a bit too obvious.
**Ataylor**: My suggestion would be that we chat about what?
**Ataylor**: Those specific things you want to see on socials, those specific CTAs, so that we can craft specific content that's less general.
**Ataylor**: So beyond project builds and just showcasing builds, what other.
**Ataylor**: What.
**Ataylor**: What.
**Ataylor**: What else?
**Ataylor**: And having people call to, you know, do.
**Bclymer**: I mean, is there a way that you can, like, look up and see what other, you know, construction or design build or construction influencers, you know, what posts are getting the most traction?
**Bclymer**: Like, is there a way to look up and see what, hey, what are people responding to?
**Bclymer**: What is getting the most comments or likes or however you measure that stuff.
**Bclymer**: And then, you know, my thought is, you know, we can take stuff like that and, you know, repurpose it, change it up a little bit.
**Bclymer**: I mean, I don't think we have to, especially for stuff like this, that's just putting stuff out there.
**Bclymer**: Like, just use what's already working.
**Ataylor**: Right.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: So a lot of the ones that are performing the best are videos and things like that, which we're working on creating for small graphics like this.
**Ataylor**: We've done a lot of the trending or top posts around design, build and different things like that.
**Ataylor**: And I don't want to repeat too much, but we can continue to kind of sift through the Internet and find things that we can.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I mean, let's.
**Bclymer**: Again, let's look at, like, you know, let's say, all right, here's the top 25, you know, things or whatever that are.
**Bclymer**: People are engaging with or whatever that is.
**Bclymer**: You know, I'm, you know, if.
**Bclymer**: If you have to delineate, say, all right, here's a list of videos, and here's a list of, you know, still shots or whatever images.
**Bclymer**: You know, then we can look and say, like, all right, like this video, the top video gets 40 million views, but the top image only gets 4,000.
**Bclymer**: Like, okay, that's a huge difference, right?
**Bclymer**: If it's okay, the top video got, you know, 4 million views and the top image got 3 million views.
**Bclymer**: It's like, all right, well, that's still pretty good.
**Bclymer**: You know, that's.
**Bclymer**: I just, you know, I'd like to see the data, like, the metrics on it.
**Bclymer**: It's like, all right, what's.
**Bclymer**: What are the top people doing that are getting engagement?
**Ataylor**: Sure.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, I think that that would be a great thing.
**Ataylor**: We can absolutely put that together for you.
**Ataylor**: So we're showing you where we're getting our strategy from.
**Ataylor**: That's absolutely doable.
**Bclymer**: Cool.
**Ataylor**: Okay, so we'll continue to go through the rest of these, and you can point out any ones that you're not happy with.
**Ataylor**: And now put it on our list on our side to create a.
**Ataylor**: Just numbers for you to look at in terms of what's trending in this particular industry.
**Ataylor**: All right, this is a.
**Ataylor**: A throwback build to cart Memphis in 2023.
**Ataylor**: So these are from the project job folder.
**Ataylor**: And then this is from.
**Ataylor**: I went into the job folder to find, like, some sort of document that fits scope of work.
**Ataylor**: And then Took this from that and put it into a caption.
**Ataylor**: So I just would need this information confirmed that it's correct.
**Bclymer**: So I would.
**Bclymer**: I would just change the verbiage to say.
**Bclymer**: Instead of saying in 2023, I would just say we transformed Cart.com's Memphis location.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: I would say break room, millwork, comma, and then say a full office build out.
**Bclymer**: I don't know if grammatically if and makes sense there or not.
**Bclymer**: But, you know, I don't know if.
**Bclymer**: You know what?
**Bclymer**: I don't know if you do no work, semicolon, a full office build out or what.
**Bclymer**: I'm not an English major.
**Ataylor**: No, no.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, I'll make sure that this makes sense because you're not installing a break room or a full office.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: So I'll just rework this because it will just need some different verbs.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: So this one signs of a job that's running.
**Ataylor**: Right.
**Ataylor**: So this may be in a similar vein of the one we talked about before.
**Bclymer**: Have.
**Bclymer**: Have we done a.
**Bclymer**: Have we done a post about being urgent early?
**Ataylor**: Yes, but we can bring that back around.
**Ataylor**: So something that's important to Alito in general, so.
**Bclymer**: Or like the ownership mindset.
**Bclymer**: Like.
**Ataylor**: I have plenty of notes on this from you, so I can put together another one for this month from it.
**Ataylor**: And if you also.
**Jdawson**: This could be part of.
**Jdawson**: Sorry to interrupt you, Anika.
**Jdawson**: This could be part of the videos, the video script, Brandon, that you have to record as part of, you know, like this one of the questions you relate to that.
**Jdawson**: So we can be used for that too, for the owner, ownership mindset.
**Jdawson**: And ordinarily we can try to.
**Jdawson**: Just don't forget that.
**Jdawson**: I'll send you the link again.
**Jdawson**: It's just something quick that you can record.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, the questions I'm going to do, I got with AJ is going to be in the office tomorrow, so he'll.
**Bclymer**: That way you can read them to me and I can answer it.
**Jdawson**: Okay, sounds good.
**Jdawson**: And then, Anika, this is, you know, other thing, but Justin, the guy from the Tapinut ceremony, he's already working on photos and videos, so I have a link already that I share with him so he can post everything directly to our folder rather than, you know, different Google Drives and all the stuff.
**Jdawson**: So once I have the link full with the video edited and the photos, I'll send them to you.
**Jdawson**: I'll use it to you, Brandon.
**Jdawson**: Of course.
**Jdawson**: So we can.
**Jdawson**: Obviously we can post some of that.
**Jdawson**: Some of the steps from your personal too, but I'll send it to you.
**Jdawson**: But that's definitely going to be before the end of this week because he's working on it right now.
**Ataylor**: Great, that's great to know.
**Ataylor**: Okay, so I can work in some just in content into this one as well.
**Bclymer**: Here, scroll down, scroll down so I can read the rest of that.
**Bclymer**: So that's all good.
**Bclymer**: The only thing is signs of job is running, right?
**Bclymer**: RFI is moving fast.
**Ataylor**: Just sounds off.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I would say being proactive would be the first one.
**Ataylor**: Just being proactive.
**Bclymer**: So like.
**Ataylor**: Or RFIs?
**Bclymer**: No, no, just in general.
**Bclymer**: So like the biggest thing is like success when it comes to, you know, a project.
**Bclymer**: You know, nine times out of ten it's being proactive because so many times people are reactive.
**Bclymer**: That's what an RFI is, right?
**Bclymer**: An RFI request for information.
**Bclymer**: Well, more than likely that's, you know, oh shoot, this is messed up.
**Bclymer**: It's a reactive thing or this happened or that happened, whatever.
**Bclymer**: Like proactiveness, like when you have proactive movement, communication, syncs all that stuff, that's what really, that's what really is going to help set a project up.
**Bclymer**: Come here.
**Ataylor**: Okay, so how is what you said, proactive movement or project here?
**Ataylor**: Communication.
**Ataylor**: Clear communications.
**Bclymer**: You've already got clear communication.
**Bclymer**: But you know, it's you know, being, you know, maybe there's a better way to wordsmith it, you know, but it's, it's really about being again proactive.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: And I mean that, that dives into like, you know, how I had the whole like urgent early thing.
**Bclymer**: But you know, I mean really it's like, you know, being proactive.
**Bclymer**: Finding you know, issues before they are issues.
**Bclymer**: Right, right.
**Bclymer**: I mean even when you talk about being early on, that's like really studying, I guess the superintendent really studying and going through the drawings like you know, doing your pre installed meetings, getting feedback from the subs, you know, asking questions.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Like you know, just saying like, okay, what is this?
**Bclymer**: Why do we do this?
**Bclymer**: How can we do it faster?
**Bclymer**: Things like that.
**Bclymer**: How can be more efficient, you know, ask a better question, get a better answer.
**Bclymer**: That's you know, really the name of the game.
**Ataylor**: Gotcha.
**Ataylor**: I like that too.
**Ataylor**: That can be a good quote for you.
**Jdawson**: I don't know if it's like an expression in English for this, but maybe don't take anything for granted.
**Jdawson**: Even if you are in the project, like some of the things are not going to run smoothly.
**Jdawson**: So don't take anything for granted.
**Jdawson**: Just make sure to double check everything, you know, with the supervisors, the tools, everything.
**Jdawson**: I Don't know if there's an expression for that, Brandon, in English, but I just will say, don't take everything for granted.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I think we say that's like, don't be a dipshit.
**Ataylor**: That's the.
**Jdawson**: Okay, I'm being polite.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: I'm.
**Ataylor**: I'm getting a call about three times in a row.
**Ataylor**: I'm just going to answer this really fast to make sure it's not an emergency.
**Ataylor**: I'll be right back.
**Bclymer**: Cool.
**Ataylor**: And.
**Ataylor**: Okay, thank you for holding on for a minute.
**Bclymer**: Did you extend your car's insurance coverage?
**Ataylor**: Could you send it to me?
**Ataylor**: No, no, I have to get a new key for my car, so.
**Ataylor**: So it is.
**Ataylor**: It is about a car, but it's not a key.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: So this is seeking quotes, the last one from the list that we got from Maria.
**Ataylor**: And so just look over it and make sure that you are happy with what it says.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I mean, the only thing is, like, it says most mhe integrators stop at the racks.
**Bclymer**: We keep going.
**Bclymer**: So that's implying that we are an mhe integrator.
**Bclymer**: And so, you know, like, in reality, like, what it is, is, you know, most.
**Bclymer**: You know, most mhe integrators just stick to that.
**Bclymer**: And then they have the client.
**Bclymer**: The customer, you know, handle all the infrastructure for that.
**Bclymer**: Well, that's what we do is we handle all the infrastructure, because at the end of the day, even if it's the client's fault, you know, they're.
**Bclymer**: They're their facilities guy or whatever.
**Bclymer**: You know, mess something up and then it's the project's behind.
**Bclymer**: Like, the CEO doesn't care.
**Bclymer**: He's just pissed the projects behind and everybody suffers.
**Bclymer**: So instead we do everything that the integrators don't, and then that way we can ensure the go live date gets hit.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Okay, that's great.
**Ataylor**: I will make those changes because I want to word Smith that a little bit.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: So if you wanted to feature another trade partner for August.
**Ataylor**: What, similar to how we did Deem Electric last month or this month, I guess.
**Ataylor**: What trade partner would you want to spotlight it?
**Bclymer**: Maybe superior?
**Bclymer**: I don't know if they have any kind of web prep, like, social media presence.
**Bclymer**: They're framing.
**Ataylor**: Are they based in Indiana?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, they're.
**Bclymer**: Andy.
**Ataylor**: It looks like I'm not seeing immediate socials, but I'll do a little more digging.
**Ataylor**: Deem didn't have a ton of immediate socials either, but there's give and take with that.
**Ataylor**: It is better to find somebody with a tag Okay.
**Ataylor**: I think this is the right.
**Ataylor**: It looks like they do have socials.
**Bclymer**: Please get in there.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I mean, trying to think who we use a lot.
**Bclymer**: I mean, yeah, they're.
**Bclymer**: You know, we use them, you know, quite a bit.
**Bclymer**: I think.
**Mcalcetero**: So.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I mean, I guess.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, we can do them.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Is it.
**Ataylor**: Oh, no, that's Florida.
**Ataylor**: It's not superior construction, is it?
**Ataylor**: Just superior or superior framing?
**Bclymer**: I mean, I'm not sure what they're.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I think it's.
**Ataylor**: Superior Framing Corporation.
**Bclymer**: I don't know about that.
**Ataylor**: We can get the exact details when you're choosing time to look them up.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I don't know what their.
**Bclymer**: What their web website is.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Maria, do you think you could help us identify that just after the call, and make sure that we get the right superior logo and information and tagging and all of that?
**Ataylor**: Perhaps one of the project managers knows that's working with them.
**Jdawson**: I mean, if we find which one it is, if there's no presence, we can try to.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, there's no presence.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, you can ask aj.
**Bclymer**: He might know.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Again, they may not have any.
**Bclymer**: Really?
**Bclymer**: Anything.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Because.
**Ataylor**: What.
**Jdawson**: I'll check with aj.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: I'm texting him.
**Jdawson**: I will.
**Ataylor**: Okay, thank you.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: Because it looks like there's superior framing, superior walls, superior construction.
**Ataylor**: So we just want to.
**Ataylor**: If it's one of those, just knowing exactly which one.
**Ataylor**: Okay, so this is the.
**Ataylor**: This is the testimonial that we chatted about, Maria.
**Ataylor**: So this is the full message that Allison had sent Brandon on LinkedIn.
**Ataylor**: And then this is a recreation of the chart that she was referencing.
**Ataylor**: So it's Alito Brandon.
**Ataylor**: So I'll give you a chance to read through that.
**Ataylor**: But that.
**Ataylor**: This is word for word, her testimonial.
**Bclymer**: Is it.
**Bclymer**: Is it.
**Jdawson**: Oh, yeah, that's the one from LinkedIn.
**Jdawson**: Remember?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Doing.
**Bclymer**: Is it, like, do we want to put that information at the bottom there, like, her info?
**Ataylor**: We can make it anonymous, if you prefer.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I would.
**Bclymer**: I would probably say, like, let's make it anonymous.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: Or else we should probably get her consent.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, exactly.
**Ataylor**: Okay, so I'll just anonymize it.
**Ataylor**: You're probably familiar with this graph.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I already know the metric.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: And then this is the caption.
**Bclymer**: I would say a candidate.
**Ataylor**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: And you would say them, not her.
**Ataylor**: I'll make these changes.
**Bclymer**: You can probably drop the.
**Bclymer**: Inspired by the Eisenhower matrix.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: I don't think I added it to the graphic.
**Bclymer**: I don't think he's gonna sue us.
**Bclymer**: He's Dead.
**Ataylor**: That's true.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I mean, I.
**Bclymer**: It looks good.
**Bclymer**: I mean, the biggest thing is I would say like, you know, probably zoom back in for me.
**Bclymer**: So scroll back down.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So I'd say the biggest thing is, you know, it says right there, this is what you know, leadership leaves a lasting impression.
**Bclymer**: And here's to leading with clarity.
**Bclymer**: You know, I would say like, maybe something like, you know, you could put something like leadership is.
**Bclymer**: Isn't something that only happens, you know, inside the workplace.
**Bclymer**: It's the way you live your life.
**Bclymer**: You know, something like that.
**Jdawson**: Oh, wow.
**Jdawson**: Such a great photos from Justin.
**Jdawson**: I'll share this with you guys for the topping out ceremony.
**Jdawson**: Such a really good photos.
**Jdawson**: I'll send them to you.
**Bclymer**: Good.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: I think that looks good.
**Ataylor**: You want to move on to the next one?
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Ataylor**: So this is another build feature.
**Ataylor**: This is Zion okc.
**Ataylor**: I got these pictures from the build folder.
**Ataylor**: So Jesse's on the call, so you can point out if anything looks amiss.
**Ataylor**: First one.
**Ataylor**: Also, as I pick the photos, I try to pick the ones that look the best or maybe it has something interesting, but if something looks mundane and I'm not sure about that, just let me know and I'll change it out.
**Bclymer**: I'd say probably the last one there, that's just a pile of height.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Not interesting.
**Ataylor**: No problem.
**Ataylor**: Okay, here's the caption.
**Ataylor**: Oh, again, I got this information from the folder in sort of like a scope of work type of document.
**Ataylor**: So you see anything that's incorrect, ma', am.
**Bclymer**: You don't need to get that detailed.211 Apolonko rack.
**Bclymer**: Sprinklers.
**Ataylor**: Maybe just sprinklers.
**Bclymer**: It would just be like, hey, you know, you know this, you know, this is an adverb system, so you want to tag adverb in it.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So you know, when Zion and it's not Zion okc, like Zion is the company, OKC is the city that it was in.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Ataylor**: Right.
**Bclymer**: We just put Zion OKC because that's it.
**Bclymer**: So, you know, when Zion needed, you know, Zion, you know, reached out about, you know, you know, needing help with the adverb ASRs system in Oklahoma City.
**Bclymer**: You know, Oedo answered the call, you know, with our full, you know, in house sprinkler division, we were able to.
**Bclymer**: With our full in house sprinkler division, we were able to come in, knock it out and take, you know, take concerns off the client so they could focus on other issues that going on, you know, something like that.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: Okay, so this is too Specific with this.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I mean, you know, first of all, Nobody gives a Schedule 10 pipe like 8,500 linear feet, like.
**Ataylor**: Gotcha, gotcha.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: How does the rest of it look?
**Bclymer**: It's kind of precise, code driven work that keeps facilities protected operation.
**Bclymer**: You know, I would say it's the kind of, you know, high efficiency delivery that keeps projects on time and integrators hitting their go live date.
**Ataylor**: Okay, great.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, you need to, you know, put something about mhe down there.
**Bclymer**: You got fire protection, sprinkler system, you know, so they're both the same thing.
**Bclymer**: So mhe.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: I have to look up a, a good hashtag, a trending hashtag.
**Ataylor**: So.
**Ataylor**: But yes, I like one.
**Ataylor**: Okay, perfect.
**Ataylor**: And then.
**Bclymer**: All right, so.
**Bclymer**: And keep in mind.
**Bclymer**: So like when Zion reached out about needing indirect sprinklers for adverb.
**Bclymer**: For an adverb.
**Bclymer**: ASRs.
**Bclymer**: So when Zion reached out about needing Interact sprinklers or ASRs.
**Bclymer**: Autumn.
**Bclymer**: And you can Google what that is, but it's automatic sorting and retrieval system or.
**Bclymer**: And no indirect sprinklers.
**Bclymer**: 4 and 4A.
**Ataylor**: Oh, 4.
**Bclymer**: I don't know if N or a.
**Bclymer**: Whatever's the right one for system in Oklahoma City.
**Bclymer**: You know, we don't answer the call.
**Ataylor**: Okay, so that looks correct.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: Okay, fantastic.
**Ataylor**: Thank you for going through that.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: And that is the last one for this month.
**Ataylor**: For now we'll go through and go.
**Bclymer**: Down to that healthcare ones that Jesse's on.
**Ataylor**: Oh, perfect.
**Ataylor**: So Jesse, this healthcare post, we wanted to make sure that this information spoke accurately with how Alito handles healthcare bills.
**Ataylor**: If you don't like anything on here.
**Ataylor**: So this first one is airflow and infection control.
**Ataylor**: Let me know if you can read it.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, I can read it.
**Mcalcetero**: So and again, this is us partnering with a design team.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: So that could be its own square is partnering with a, you know, healthcare focused design team.
**Ataylor**: Is that correct?
**Mcalcetero**: I don't know Brian, what you think, but I mean like it's not like we're gonna design it.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I mean I, you know, I think the whole purpose is.
**Bclymer**: Right, scroll to the top there.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: So anatomy of a healthcare bill.
**Ataylor**: So it's not necessarily saying what's.
**Ataylor**: What you do.
**Ataylor**: It's what goes into a health.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: So yeah.
**Bclymer**: So I mean, you know, what are the, you know, basically the top things like that happen with that.
**Bclymer**: And so that's, that's kind of the, the point now.
**Bclymer**: I wasn't sure about like some of this stuff like airfoil and infectious control, you know, again like, and, and it doesn't really matter, like, because yeah, sure, we, we like partner with them.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Like, but I mean, just like we don't actually do a full design and everything for whatever building.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Like, we're not actual architects, but what we do do is, you know, they work for us.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Just like we're not plumbers and we're not concrete guys.
**Bclymer**: But we don't say, you know, we coordinated the construction, we say we built this building.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: So it's positioning you as a team that completely can take care of a healthcare buildings needs, however that looks.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So I, I wouldn't get too hung up on, you know, being like, oh well, we partner with the design team.
**Bclymer**: Like, no, I just say like, you know, like again, just say we.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: We as encompassing of a team.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, I mean there's just so many things when it comes to airflow.
**Mcalcetero**: There's positive pressure rooms, there's, you know.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I mean, I would say that, you know, if, if you want to send that to, to Jesse with like, again, what the.
**Bclymer**: The prompt is.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: So like what are the, you know, the five things or whatever this is, you know, that, you know, are, are you would say, or like if somebody asks you what are the five things that are critical in the healthcare bill.
**Bclymer**: Boom.
**Ataylor**: And yeah, any of these could change.
**Ataylor**: So Jesse, I'll send you each of these in the caption and kind of any information you need so that you can look at it with a keen eye.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, because like, you know, airflow and infection control.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, there's some things to reword there.
