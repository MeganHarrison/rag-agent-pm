## Transcript
**Bclymer**: Top right.
**Bclymer**: What you have a stress test at 11?
**Jdawson**: You said she's doing it now.
**Jdawson**: I gotta get, I got too much to do.
**Jdawson**: I was like, well I didn't know but I guess that the stress test like they do all these tests and they like her friend just went to a stress test last week and they're like you're not leaving.
**Jdawson**: And then induced her.
**Jdawson**: So she was like, where did that.
**Jdawson**: She's like, yeah.
**Jdawson**: She's like, we could be having a baby.
**Jdawson**: I was like, just call me.
**Bclymer**: I mean, yeah, there in 15 minutes.
**Jdawson**: I know.
**Jdawson**: Which is scary.
**Jdawson**: I mean she at all.
**Bclymer**: Here press the.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So I, I, I have to, I was going to add this in clarifications just to show we have it included because if you look like putting in a whole new ESFAR system and everything.
**Jdawson**: So it's not just a 135 bucks.
**Bclymer**: A square foot for the existing warehouse.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I mean I told him that I was going to give him a square foot number for the existing warehouse that he could put.
**Bclymer**: I said because you want this so quick unless I actually bid it out, like I can't give you.
**Jdawson**: I'm what I did.
**Bclymer**: Why I don't think we need.
**Jdawson**: So let me just show you what I did.
**Jdawson**: I First of all, this is I need you to unlock it so you can make this a number.
**Jdawson**: Number.
**Bclymer**: You don't need to make that a number.
**Bclymer**: The number should be there right here and just do.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, like that.
**Bclymer**: No, type your number there into the right.
**Bclymer**: Put what it is.
**Bclymer**: So put a million bucks, whatever that is right here.
**Bclymer**: Correct.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so 1 million.
**Bclymer**: Tab.
**Jdawson**: Oh, I just got them flip flopped.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Well anyway, my, my math is 135 bucks a square foot times 9,000 because that's the interior build out portion is what it adds up to be.
**Jdawson**: Plus 100,000 for the SFR 200 for some other like dock level.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So you're talking like 1.43 million.
**Jdawson**: I think that's a good start.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And then here I, I went to Decatur Boulevard and I just, I looked at guys Scopes and I basically just started plugging here.
**Jdawson**: So I put a $30,000 contingency in existing conditions.
**Jdawson**: I was looking on a Google Earth.
**Jdawson**: I mean have you seen it on Google Earth yet?
**Jdawson**: So you say going out to the west?
**Bclymer**: No, it's to the north.
**Jdawson**: To the north.
**Jdawson**: That's why I was confused because this shows, look at this.
**Jdawson**: You sure it's not to the west?
**Bclymer**: Pull up the, the thing.
**Jdawson**: And then this shows future expansion this way.
**Jdawson**: And then adding.
**Bclymer**: Well, they.
**Bclymer**: I go back to their little scope thing.
**Jdawson**: A little confused by it.
**Jdawson**: Either way, it doesn't really.
**Jdawson**: It doesn't matter.
**Jdawson**: I was just saying it's a lot cheaper to go out this way and extend these right versus going that way.
**Jdawson**: But I didn't know.
**Jdawson**: I was like, well, who owns that?
**Jdawson**: It looks like a farmer owns it right now.
**Bclymer**: No, they own it all.
**Jdawson**: Okay, well, anyway.
**Bclymer**: So you've got how much?
**Jdawson**: So you want just the total?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So I'm at 5 million 782 and like we're, we're more than enough.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Because what did I tell him you said?
**Jdawson**: I think it was like 140 bucks a square foot or something.
**Bclymer**: What is that?
**Bclymer**: A square foot?
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Like 118.
**Jdawson**: You're not comfortable with that.
**Jdawson**: And then I, I bumped our general conditions up a ton.
**Jdawson**: I mean, we got 300 grand in general conditions.
**Jdawson**: I have this as a, I have this as a 28 week project.
**Jdawson**: So seven months.
**Jdawson**: I got vice president time.
**Jdawson**: Pre con time.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so you need to change your pre con.
**Bclymer**: You've got how many.
**Bclymer**: That's how many weeks?
**Jdawson**: 28.
**Jdawson**: Oh, I don't think I can change that.
**Bclymer**: I don't want to change that.
**Bclymer**: Go over there.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, do like 0.15.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So that's 0.5 is 14 weeks.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: And so your vice president.
**Bclymer**: You again.
**Bclymer**: I would say 0.25.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: You know, and then senior PM.
**Bclymer**: You know, I would put 0.25 there.
**Jdawson**: 0.5 for project management.
**Bclymer**: I would say 0.75.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And then you've got engineer.
**Jdawson**: I got a full time engineer and a full time super.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: I got some, some.
**Jdawson**: Buy a new drone for it, some office supplies.
**Jdawson**: I, I noticed on here there's no temp office.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, there is.
**Bclymer**: Go up.
**Bclymer**: Stop.
**Bclymer**: Judge.
**Jdawson**: Oh, field offices.
**Jdawson**: Damn it.
**Jdawson**: There.
**Jdawson**: I was looking for like temp office, so.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, so keep going.
**Bclymer**: So, okay, like you need to add in software.
**Bclymer**: You need to add in.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Software.
**Jdawson**: Software.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yep, one of those.
**Jdawson**: I got my temp fencing in there.
**Bclymer**: Where's your temporary telecommunications?
**Jdawson**: Will there be temporary telecon?
**Jdawson**: I just figured we.
**Jdawson**: I guess I didn't know it until last, until halfway through.
**Jdawson**: I didn't know that.
**Jdawson**: There's no one in this building right now.
**Bclymer**: They'll be, they'll be.
**Jdawson**: I mean a chemical company or something.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we need temp toilets, don't we?
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: I included a little money too in the budget for the expansion for like they got to have some toilet in there, Some sort of build out.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Bclymer**: They.
**Bclymer**: They probably already do or something.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Jdawson**: One.
**Bclymer**: That's not enough.
**Bclymer**: That means one toilet.
**Bclymer**: You can eat at least three.
**Bclymer**: I'd say so.
**Bclymer**: Throw some travel in there because we have none.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: This is in Terre Haute.
**Jdawson**: So I don't know.
**Jdawson**: Are we gonna hold someone up there, you think?
**Jdawson**: Have them live out there?
**Bclymer**: What's the.
**Bclymer**: What's the.
**Bclymer**: Do you know how far it is from.
**Jdawson**: It's like an hour 15.
**Jdawson**: It's not that far from the city.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, no, we won't put somebody up there.
**Bclymer**: They can drive it.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So you.
**Bclymer**: But you need to buck up your fuel because you have zero.
**Jdawson**: See truck allowance, no fuel.
**Bclymer**: That needs to be two.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Is that you?
**Jdawson**: It's probably you.
**Jdawson**: I'd go answer it.
**Jdawson**: Marketing money, right?
**Jdawson**: Oh, it's Glenn.
**Jdawson**: I didn't know Glenn was still here.
**Jdawson**: Had some.
**Jdawson**: Some cleaning money in there.
**Jdawson**: Marketing.
**Jdawson**: I got bunch of money for tools.
**Bclymer**: This hop again where you're surveying at?
**Bclymer**: Because you got it.
**Jdawson**: I have it in existing condition.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Look at that.
**Jdawson**: 20 grand there.
**Jdawson**: I didn't know.
**Jdawson**: I mean, that's what.
**Jdawson**: More than enough.
**Bclymer**: You're printing a copy and it's not enough.
**Bclymer**: See, a 0.13 drives across a thousand dollars alone.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I.
**Jdawson**: I would put seven months there and I put 28 there and I didn't realize it calculated over there.
**Jdawson**: So at First I had 128 weeks and I was just like, this is crazy.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So just press 0.5.
**Bclymer**: Or that works too.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Because you want to generally be like 10%.
**Jdawson**: General conditions.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Common rule of thumb.
**Bclymer**: Keep scrolling.
**Jdawson**: Permit.
**Jdawson**: Oh, I did say they want us to put an allowance in there for permit requirements.
**Jdawson**: Ten grand.
**Bclymer**: No, I mean it would be more than that, I would think.
**Jdawson**: And then.
**Jdawson**: And you know, tap fees, but we would just pull off the building, right?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, we're not.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, we're not gonna.
**Jdawson**: I didn't know it could be a separate.
**Jdawson**: It was hard on the utilities.
**Jdawson**: I was like, is it going to be separate service?
**Jdawson**: Or like how you're not going to do the.
**Bclymer**: The tap fees or anything like that.
**Bclymer**: That's on them.
**Bclymer**: So permit requirements.
**Bclymer**: Put 25,000.
**Bclymer**: Testing, inspections.
**Jdawson**: How much was.
**Jdawson**: Is.
**Bclymer**: It's 15 grand for Westfield Temporary Electric.
**Jdawson**: They don't have electric there.
**Bclymer**: Well, they might, but I mean, we need to.
**Bclymer**: I mean if not, we need to have our own meter.
**Bclymer**: Need to put some temporary lighting in there.
**Bclymer**: Because once we get these.
**Bclymer**: Once these warehouses go up, you got.
**Jdawson**: To provide towers like the ones you pull behind and stuff.
**Bclymer**: So go ahead and do.
**Jdawson**: If they're.
**Jdawson**: They're like a thousand, but I know we rented them out in.
**Jdawson**: In Vegas and they were like.
**Jdawson**: Like a couple hundred bucks a month.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So I'd say.
**Jdawson**: But you need fuel for it too.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So do.
**Bclymer**: Do 500.
**Bclymer**: Put 500 in your line item there.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And then we'll say that we're going to need it for.
**Bclymer**: We're gonna need four of them for three months.
**Bclymer**: So 12.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Then throw your fuel up there.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: What's that?
**Bclymer**: Do our summary.
**Bclymer**: Scroll up to the top.
**Bclymer**: No contingency.
**Jdawson**: Get all that filled in.
**Bclymer**: Good.
**Bclymer**: All right, now go back to details.
**Bclymer**: Go to the bottom.
**Bclymer**: Throw in 5% for contingency.
**Bclymer**: All right, so I have.
**Jdawson**: Okay, this is the one I wanted to.
**Jdawson**: I have 205,000 in there for design.
**Jdawson**: So I put.
**Jdawson**: I didn't see one in here for civil, so I put it under wetland studies because they do.
**Jdawson**: They seem to be like.
**Bclymer**: You can change those.
**Jdawson**: Oh, can I?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Well, anyway, sounded like they were like, very adamant, at least from reading the scope, about stormwater management out there.
**Jdawson**: Maybe because it's farmland.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I'm not worried about it.
**Bclymer**: I think it's gonna be sheet drainage.
**Bclymer**: That's what they have now.
**Jdawson**: But I saw they have a pond there.
**Bclymer**: The vertigon.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, but like, the parking lot is sheet drainage, really.
**Bclymer**: So I.
**Bclymer**: I don't.
**Bclymer**: I'm not.
**Bclymer**: I'm not necessarily worried about it.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so throw.
**Bclymer**: Throw your geotech report.
**Bclymer**: You need to throw like probably 20 on that.
**Bclymer**: Your architectural is probably a little low.
**Bclymer**: I'd probably bump that up to like.
**Jdawson**: 110, 1, 1 00.
**Bclymer**: Few more.
**Bclymer**: Too many.
**Jdawson**: God damn it, dude.
**Jdawson**: 110.
**Jdawson**: 1, 2, 3.
**Jdawson**: Civil's probably low then you can do that for 50 grand.
**Jdawson**: It's already halfway done.
**Jdawson**: It's already halfway done.
**Bclymer**: I think that's fine.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Structural.
**Jdawson**: I had no idea.
**Bclymer**: That needs to be 60.
**Jdawson**: They do the bulk of the design on these, don't they?
**Bclymer**: Hvc, you can pull out hvc.
**Bclymer**: Pluming electrodes are all going to be in the subs.
**Bclymer**: Your survey.
**Jdawson**: You already have all this.
**Bclymer**: You already have that topographical space.
**Bclymer**: Well, though, you're still going to have to get a.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so now that's 250.
**Bclymer**: All right, that's a lot better.
**Bclymer**: Okay, let's go up, down by each division.
**Jdawson**: You want me to do a side by side with Meritex?
**Jdawson**: So you can see these are already.
**Bclymer**: The Meritex numbers aren't they?
**Jdawson**: No, I plugged like based off of square foot numbers from.
**Jdawson**: I did, I did the math there.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So existing conditions.
**Jdawson**: I just put 30,000, you know, 50 grand in there.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: We only had 10 plugged, which we're gonna have to saw cut and do some stuff when we add on the parking lot concrete.
**Jdawson**: So this is an 80,000 square foot building.
**Jdawson**: Ours is 50, but I saw that they were requesting like a heavy duty slab.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, he doesn't have any.
**Bclymer**: You just put that on there?
**Jdawson**: Well, altogether they were a little.
**Jdawson**: They were like 2.1 million.
**Jdawson**: And I have 1.45 million for concrete.
**Bclymer**: That's.
**Bclymer**: That's a little too low on your precast.
**Jdawson**: You think so?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So the different.
**Bclymer**: The thing is that you're forgetting is the massive amount of inflation from this number to that number in the last two years.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So what do you think?
**Jdawson**: I mean, because I did, you know, I did a million.
**Jdawson**: A million divided by 81.
**Jdawson**: 23.
**Jdawson**: That's basically 13 bucks a square foot, we'll call it.
**Jdawson**: And so you can see in my math here, I did 13 times.
**Bclymer**: Throw that up to 950.
**Jdawson**: This up to 950.
**Jdawson**: Oh, I was close.
**Jdawson**: Million seven.
**Jdawson**: Now keep going.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Masonry.
**Bclymer**: We don't have any.
**Jdawson**: No masonry.
**Jdawson**: So metals, same thing.
**Jdawson**: 13 bucks a square foot for.
**Jdawson**: For miscellaneous metals.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Your structural steel.
**Jdawson**: Bar, joists, columns, metal decking.
**Jdawson**: You think that's low?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I would say 16.
**Jdawson**: 800 grand.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Thermal and moisture protection.
**Jdawson**: Same thing.
**Jdawson**: 5 bucks a square foot for.
**Bclymer**: Is this supposed to be TPO?
**Jdawson**: TPO, yeah.
**Bclymer**: TPO, you're saying, is 250.
**Jdawson**: So my roofing here.
**Jdawson**: And that was every.
**Jdawson**: So that's, you know, you were flashing in a couple RTUs.
**Jdawson**: So try this again.
**Jdawson**: So I just make sure my math was right last night.
**Jdawson**: 378.
**Jdawson**: 123 divided by 81.
**Jdawson**: 23 is.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So I plugged five bucks a square foot.
**Jdawson**: That's seven.
**Bclymer**: Seven and a half.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Tariffs.
**Jdawson**: And then I put like 200 grand for architectural features.
**Bclymer**: You're kind of using a scale architectural features.
**Jdawson**: Just like, hey, you have 200 grand to make the entrance look pretty?
**Jdawson**: I don't know.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: It's a start because the, the Meritex building had.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I know.
**Bclymer**: They had those panels.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, the metal panels.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: What does the existing building that they have?
**Bclymer**: I couldn't, I couldn't.
**Jdawson**: I went on earth and I couldn't tell.
**Jdawson**: I.
**Jdawson**: Well, they had no idea.
**Bclymer**: Go to the trolley.
**Bclymer**: You can see the elevation.
**Bclymer**: It's right there.
**Bclymer**: They've got precast in the middle.
**Jdawson**: Didn't look like much except for the disk.
**Bclymer**: But that's no zoom out dude.
**Bclymer**: Go down.
**Bclymer**: Go to your pages.
**Bclymer**: Change.
**Bclymer**: Keep going.
**Bclymer**: Right there.
**Bclymer**: Stop.
**Bclymer**: Go back.
**Bclymer**: See, look at all that.
**Bclymer**: That's all metal panel.
**Jdawson**: That's metal panel down one.
**Bclymer**: Zoom in.
**Jdawson**: Oh, I thought that was a cross section.
**Jdawson**: It's a cross section.
**Jdawson**: 2,02 inch insulated metal panel on Z grids.
**Jdawson**: Okay, well then good.
**Jdawson**: I included for it.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I mean they were 289 on that.
**Jdawson**: A lot nicer.
**Jdawson**: So let me make sure I call that out and in my clarifications.
**Jdawson**: Openings.
**Jdawson**: Dude, I.
**Jdawson**: I didn't know what to put.
**Jdawson**: I mean three dock doors.
**Bclymer**: That's different.
**Bclymer**: Division doctors are 11.
**Jdawson**: You're right.
**Bclymer**: This is simply just storefront and all metal.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I put in a lot.
**Jdawson**: I was just gonna say allowance.
**Jdawson**: JL Glass was 126,000.
**Jdawson**: There's a lot more glass on Meritex than this one.
**Bclymer**: That 70 up to 100.
**Jdawson**: Doors.
**Jdawson**: 20 grand.
**Jdawson**: That's man doors.
**Jdawson**: I don't know why I put.
**Jdawson**: I think I meant to put 20,000 there but whatever finishes.
**Jdawson**: I have some build out allowance for like bathrooms and you know you gotta bring in probably a new fire pump in.
**Jdawson**: Well because with the breezeway we have to.
**Jdawson**: They have.
**Jdawson**: They just have a.
**Jdawson**: A stub going into the building right now.
**Jdawson**: And you can't have a pipe go across the breezeway that we build.
**Bclymer**: Why?
**Jdawson**: That breezeway I thought would only be like 10 foot tall to connect the two.
**Bclymer**: So they right now they're civil.
**Bclymer**: They have one fire line going in.
**Jdawson**: But it's not connected.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, they have one fire line going in.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So I thought we'd bring a whole new fire line into the other building.
**Jdawson**: There'd be two separate system pumps.
**Bclymer**: Well, there's not going to be a pump.
**Bclymer**: It's not.
**Bclymer**: Is there a pump on the first one through the drawing?
**Jdawson**: No, there's not.
**Jdawson**: I just figured because we had a pump it go to the.
**Bclymer**: To the right.
**Bclymer**: There you go.
**Jdawson**: I just figured because we had a pump at.
**Bclymer**: All the way down.
**Jdawson**: You don't have anything here.
**Bclymer**: I mean that's mechanical.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Jdawson**: I'm just looking for a room.
**Bclymer**: Go to the front page of the architectural.
**Bclymer**: The COVID page.
**Bclymer**: Go to next page.
**Bclymer**: Where's the code analysis page?
**Bclymer**: That's not it.
**Jdawson**: I know.
**Jdawson**: I'm looking for maybe under miscellaneous details.
**Bclymer**: No, keep going.
**Jdawson**: Building requirements here.
**Bclymer**: Keep going, keep going.
**Bclymer**: All the way from next page.
**Bclymer**: Utilities.
**Bclymer**: What's that Right there.
**Jdawson**: Utility page, site drainage and utility plan.
**Bclymer**: Go back to Sunday to go up 1.
**Bclymer**: I think it's 5.
**Jdawson**: It's grading.
**Bclymer**: Hey, Sam.
**Bclymer**: Doing well?
**Bclymer**: How are you?
**Bclymer**: Okay, perfect.
**Bclymer**: So do you know.
**Bclymer**: So one thing I called you.
**Bclymer**: I was unclear like when I, When I, When I read through the, you know, your guys's ACI report.
**Bclymer**: So I, I assumed it was scheme A.
**Bclymer**: Combustible liquids is what was going in that racking to the far right.
**Bclymer**: But it wasn't clear it like because it of the above that they had another section for a different.
**Bclymer**: It would be a different protection scheme.
**Bclymer**: But.
**Bclymer**: And it said that was going to go into.
**Bclymer**: I think it was combustible liquids is what it was.
**Bclymer**: And that was going to go into wrecking as well.
**Bclymer**: But I didn't know where that was going, if that was in the room or what I think.
**Bclymer**: So I don't have it in front of me.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, the acid stuff.
**Bclymer**: So all that's going to the, the A and C reckon on the right.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: Well, we just have to look at it because when I read that it.
**Bclymer**: The report didn't specify those two things would be stored in the same location.
**Bclymer**: So I'm not, I, you know, if we, I'm not sure we can like in the same rack.
**Bclymer**: I'm not, I'm not sure, you know, I'm not going to say and pretend like I have all the answers just off the top of my head.
**Bclymer**: That's a flag I think we want to explore and make sure that we're good on that.
**Bclymer**: Like scheme A, which is what we have is pretty stringent.
**Bclymer**: So it may be okay because the other one is a lesser protection scheme, you know.
**Bclymer**: But I also am not a chemist.
**Bclymer**: I don't know if battery acid mixing with this other thing, maybe it's an explosion.
**Bclymer**: I have no idea how that works.
**Bclymer**: So that's something that we want to probably look at just to be, just to be certain.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Because last thing we want to do is get in there and not work.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, but like for instance, which is there a chance where you'd have like say on the first level a battery, in the second level motor oil and then vice versa.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And I'm not, I'm not, I'm not saying that's the, the law or the rule.
**Bclymer**: I'm just simply saying they're, they're, they're, they're different schemes.
**Bclymer**: And I, you know, I want to make sure that you guys have, you know, as much flexibility as possible.
**Bclymer**: Last thing I want is you guys, to put something in there, God forbid something happens and your insurance is like, well, you didn't abide by this.
**Bclymer**: See ya.
**Bclymer**: So it's just, it's just something that, you know, you guys need to, you know, and I'm happy to work with you guys and your team and everybody to make sure that the eyes are dotted, T's are crossed.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And like I said, ski scheme A is, is pretty, pretty stringent.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: I guess the other thing I'm thinking is like when you talk about motor oil, that's a combustible liquid and you know, you may very well have to have some sort of like auto homes, you'll have to have some kind of leak protection, drain system, something like that.
**Bclymer**: Because again, that stuff falls on the ground, is on fire and it spreads.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Because the flame burns on top of it, it doesn't consume it.
**Bclymer**: And so that's just something to look at too.
**Bclymer**: Like, you know, if I look, I remember looking at your room, I think you guys have a drain system in your room, if I'm not mistaken.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: I would definitely, definitely, I would definitely do that.
**Bclymer**: The vertical barrier.
**Bclymer**: Just because cutting and putting in a trench system, like when you talk about cutting that existing slab and putting in a drain system, like two things.
**Bclymer**: One, it's very permanent and two, it's very costly and time consuming versus, you know, if you, if you do the, you know, you're up the wall or whatever you're going to use to protect it, that's much easier to remove if you ever want to change it.
**Bclymer**: As far as timeline goes, it's not the first thing, it's the last thing.
**Bclymer**: Like so, you know, it may, you know, it may look like it may be more cost effective on the front end to do the drain, but you know, as far as flexibility and timeline stuff, I would, you know, unless it's just crazy expensive, which it shouldn't be, I think the barrier is your best move.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Well, like, so when you say a vertical barrier, like a certain flatness, like so what do you, what do you mean?
**Bclymer**: Like you're saying, like.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so you're saying a vertical barrier across the entryway versa.
**Bclymer**: Okay, I thought you were talking about all the way around the bill.
**Bclymer**: I thought I saw a note maybe, I mean, maybe I was wrong.
**Bclymer**: I thought I saw a note where it talked about doing a drain all a trench all the way around the room.
**Bclymer**: Right, but talked about doing a trench all the way around the room, but you're just talking about doing a trench in the opening.
**Bclymer**: So what I, what I would do is I would do your barrier around the walls, you know, just seal that.
**Bclymer**: And then I would do a, like a 6 or a 10 inch trench drain in your overhead door.
**Bclymer**: So then, so then that way you, you know, things can drive across, you know, and instead of having trip train all the way around, if something happens, you know, it can flow into that, you know, Tristram, you just make it, you know, again a six or 10, you know, just bigger.
**Bclymer**: And then, and then every, and then every, and then everything would drain to right there.
**Bclymer**: But that prevents you from, from saw cutting around the entire building or the room.
**Bclymer**: I should.
**Bclymer**: So like you're, you're, you're over, you're over at your door where the robots go in and out that overhead door.
**Bclymer**: Put a trench drain across that opening instead of a vertical barrier.
**Bclymer**: Because a vertical barrier you're going to have to dig down and put it underground so it's smooth.
**Bclymer**: Instead do a trench drain just across that area and so then you've got a curve all the way around the building and then you got your trench drain right there.
**Bclymer**: So you know, anything, nothing's going to escape it would, it would hit that trench drain.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: What's the, what's the FFFL number you need?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah, I think you can do like again, you can do, you can do a large, you know, plate like the stain a stainless steel with pinholes in it.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: So it's not, not a great.
**Bclymer**: And then that can be, that can be very smooth.
**Bclymer**: You just have to meet the tolerance.
**Bclymer**: Like it's just like when we, it's just like when we do hospitals, right, and we do MRI machines, we have to have like 9090 on our flatness.
**Bclymer**: Like it's ridiculous.
**Bclymer**: Like, and there's a way to do it.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, so, so yeah, there's definitely a way to do it.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: What time is the meeting on Thursday here?
**Jdawson**: It's going to be.
**Bclymer**: The landlord just tried to call me, so I'll give him a call back.
**Bclymer**: I wanted him to be able to work into his meeting.
**Bclymer**: It's 9:00 o'clock Eastern.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I'll, I'll have to, I'll have to do the conversion because I'll actually be in, I'll be in Europe to see, so I don't know what time it'll be.
**Bclymer**: I mean it's 9 o' clock Eastern.
**Bclymer**: Then it should be like in the afternoon, I think, over there.
**Bclymer**: So it should be.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Or like a info security thing.
**Bclymer**: What do you Mean, what do you mean?
**Bclymer**: What do you mean a trusted source?
**Bclymer**: What would be a trusted source?
**Bclymer**: So, like that.
**Bclymer**: Gotcha.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I mean, it's not a big deal.
**Bclymer**: Just, you know, I mean, I know all of ours are held in our company, you know, Fireflies account, but I mean, it doesn't matter.
**Bclymer**: Whatever works for you guys.
**Bclymer**: It's not a not a big deal.
**Bclymer**: Well, if you need to send me over an NDA order, we'll sign that.
**Bclymer**: Okay, cool.
**Bclymer**: Well, yeah, so just let me know.
**Bclymer**: And I guess the PO comes from you guys or how do you guys issue.
**Bclymer**: Okay, just a, just a word, you know, from experience here.
**Bclymer**: Typically if you do run it through them, they're going to put 3% or 4% or 5% on top of it, you know, and charge you guys that.
**Bclymer**: So just keep that in mind, you know, because typically a lot of times like, like our clients will, they'll issue the PO to us or whatever and they'll just get reimbursed by the landlord.
**Bclymer**: Like, hey, here's the, here's the money we used for the ti.
**Bclymer**: Give us that TI dollars.
**Bclymer**: Like, because the TI dollars, there's no rule that says it has to go through them, right?
**Bclymer**: They can issue them to you.
**Bclymer**: You just have to show that you've spent the money.
**Bclymer**: So again, it's just a way to, if, you know, A, give you guys more control, B, sting a little bit, you know, especially when you're talking about a 10.
**Bclymer**: 10 million dollar job.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: 5% adds up.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah, I'm sure.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, we've worked with them a lot.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Do you know who's the PM on that one?
**Bclymer**: Oh, yeah, great.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Hedges.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah, about 10 projects.
**Bclymer**: Yep, yep, yep.
**Bclymer**: We did.
**Bclymer**: I did one in Georgia with him a couple years ago.
**Bclymer**: Chris.
**Bclymer**: Nice guys.
**Bclymer**: A little higher up on the totem pole over there, but.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah, yep.
**Bclymer**: Absolutely.
**Bclymer**: Absolutely tight, man.
**Bclymer**: Well, sounds good.
**Bclymer**: Look forward to it.
**Bclymer**: Do you know, you know, one thing I want to go over.
**Bclymer**: You said you guys are expanding, you know what, you know, what kind of buildings you looking for.
**Bclymer**: And we're at.
**Bclymer**: Because, you know, we obviously partner with a lot of developers and do development, so there might be some, some opportunity there for you.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, three a year.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: But I think, you know, the next one.
**Bclymer**: Nice.
**Bclymer**: Probably Allentown or something like that.
**Bclymer**: What's the.
**Bclymer**: So you got this one in Harrisburg area.
**Bclymer**: What's the second one?
**Bclymer**: Gotcha.
**Bclymer**: Is that what doing the same build out or something?
**Bclymer**: Or what's the.
**Bclymer**: There you go.
**Bclymer**: Where are you at?
**Bclymer**: On Mountain Reverse logistics area.
**Bclymer**: Gotcha.
**Bclymer**: So you guys gotcha.
**Bclymer**: But you don't have any ASRs in there, I take it.
**Bclymer**: Well, yeah, we'll get this one and then, you know, ideally, you know, we get a shot at the.
**Bclymer**: The full build for the.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, for sure.
**Bclymer**: Well, you know, that's why we keep paying people to say nice things about us.
**Bclymer**: Cool.
**Bclymer**: Awesome.
**Bclymer**: Sam, look forward to working with you.
**Bclymer**: See ya.
**Bclymer**: Who's that with gpc?
**Jdawson**: Oh, Harrisburg.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I got it.
**Jdawson**: Nice.
**Jdawson**: How much is that one?
**Bclymer**: 2.4 just sprinkler.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: So easy.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, 2.4.
**Bclymer**: And I think I've got, I don't know a decent amount.
**Jdawson**: 2.4.
**Jdawson**: I would hope like half a mil.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I made sure I bumped up a lot on that one too.
**Jdawson**: That makes you feel good.
**Jdawson**: Good Friday.
**Jdawson**: That helps too.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: All right, you want to power through this.
**Jdawson**: Liz is getting induced.
**Jdawson**: Friday morning, 2:00am Next Friday, 2:00am that sucks.
**Jdawson**: I asked for that.
**Bclymer**: Why?
**Bclymer**: Born on the 4th of July.
**Jdawson**: I didn't even know.
**Jdawson**: I told you.
**Jdawson**: You were in here.
**Jdawson**: I told you.
**Jdawson**: When did you join?
**Bclymer**: I've been just sitting here listening.
**Bclymer**: Have you really posting messages you guys don't listen to?
**Jdawson**: That's funny.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: She just got the.
**Jdawson**: They did her stress test and her blood pressures through the roof and they said watch it this weekend, but definitely no later than Friday.
**Bclymer**: I guess I need the fourth of July.
**Bclymer**: It's a week.
**Jdawson**: No, that's what I said as soon.
**Jdawson**: As soon as she called me.
**Jdawson**: It's like fourth of July.
**Jdawson**: She goes, no, no, no.
**Jdawson**: Week before check out.
**Jdawson**: Damn it.
**Bclymer**: Tell her just hold on, baby.
**Bclymer**: It's a week.
**Bclymer**: It's worth it.
**Jdawson**: You keep going.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: Share my screen here.
**Jdawson**: Now that Jesse's here, I'll get the clarifications are pretty much done.
**Jdawson**: It's just very boilerplate stuff.
**Jdawson**: Details.
**Jdawson**: Okay, where were we at?
**Jdawson**: We were trying to find a pump room.
**Jdawson**: I know Meritex has a pump room.
**Bclymer**: So I think is that pump room that you pulled up on the drawing.
**Jdawson**: That was Meritx's.
**Jdawson**: I didn't.
**Jdawson**: There wasn't one on theirs.
**Bclymer**: Gotcha.
**Jdawson**: So all right.
**Jdawson**: I got some paint.
**Jdawson**: Some paint for the exterior.
**Jdawson**: Okay, keep going.
**Jdawson**: Specialties.
**Jdawson**: Just.
**Jdawson**: I didn't know what to plug here, to be honest.
**Jdawson**: Put some fire extinguishers on the columns.
**Jdawson**: Good enough.
**Bclymer**: Fifteen hundred dollars for a Knox box.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: I just assumed they may have one already.
**Jdawson**: But I guess if it's a separate building because.
**Jdawson**: Because I'm honestly, I'm going to bump this up because they want These fire doors.
**Jdawson**: They want those fire doors here.
**Jdawson**: Connection tunnels with.
**Jdawson**: With fire doors.
**Bclymer**: That'll be an 11.
**Bclymer**: But.
**Jdawson**: Well, we gotta frame it right somehow.
**Jdawson**: Precast.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: We'll have to do something.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: We're covered.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Equipment, loading dock, equipment.
**Jdawson**: I put 90 grand in there.
**Bclymer**: Scroll down, guardrail.
**Jdawson**: Add some guardrail in there.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: You think 10 grand?
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: And then go to fire.
**Bclymer**: Quick up one.
**Bclymer**: Type in fire doors.
**Jdawson**: There's got to be 25 per a piece.
**Jdawson**: Right?
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: No casework.
**Jdawson**: Nope.
**Jdawson**: And then we go down fire suppression.
**Jdawson**: So the ESFR system for, for theirs, they were at 180 grand for an 80,000 square foot building.
**Jdawson**: I put 105 in there for 50,000 square foot building.
**Bclymer**: Should be good.
**Jdawson**: Should be good.
**Jdawson**: That's like 20 bucks a square foot.
**Jdawson**: That's like probably way too much.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Plumbing.
**Bclymer**: I.
**Jdawson**: You know, you get a bathroom and do you think three RTUs?
**Bclymer**: I don't think they're.
**Jdawson**: Well, they want them conditioned.
**Jdawson**: It's got to be 75 degrees.
**Jdawson**: So that's why I need to bump this up because when I read that.
**Jdawson**: So that's 72 per like 15 ton unit.
**Jdawson**: I would think.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I mean how.
**Jdawson**: What is it?
**Jdawson**: 500.
**Jdawson**: That may not even be enough.
**Jdawson**: There was three units at Merit X for 80, 000 square, but those are probably 25 times.
**Bclymer**: Well, and those are ERUs.
**Bclymer**: Weren't.
**Bclymer**: They wasn't RDU.
**Jdawson**: So they were ERUs.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: They weren't actual condition.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So conditioned.
**Jdawson**: You need to do two RTUs in Dallas.
**Jdawson**: Cost me and these suckers were big.
**Jdawson**: 300 grand.
**Bclymer**: That's too much.
**Bclymer**: No, you can, you can get them for.
**Bclymer**: You can do four units at I would say 65 each.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Jdawson**: 250.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, that's right.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: What's.
**Jdawson**: What, what is it?
**Jdawson**: It's five.
**Bclymer**: It's 260.
**Jdawson**: But yeah, it's a one ton is 500 square foot though.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So 30 ton units.
**Jdawson**: 50,000 divided by five.
**Jdawson**: I need 100 tons.
**Jdawson**: So four 25 ton units.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And they'd just be like blow and go diffusers, right?
**Bclymer**: Correct.
**Jdawson**: Okay, moving on.
**Jdawson**: Electrical, 260k there.
**Jdawson**: I just took half of that ERMCO number.
**Jdawson**: That's LED lighting and hooking up.
**Jdawson**: Everything new service.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, that's probably a little light because you gotta think you got your, your gear size is gonna have to be bigger.
**Jdawson**: 300.
**Jdawson**: One, two, three.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Oh for.
**Jdawson**: Well, because they're bringing in that chemical company too.
**Jdawson**: So it's probably got to be even more.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I would hope that.
**Bclymer**: Especially because tariffs.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Like all the cost getting in.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Earthwork.
**Jdawson**: This one's obviously is kind of a stab in the dark.
**Jdawson**: So I wanted to be on the.
**Jdawson**: On the.
**Jdawson**: On the better side.
**Jdawson**: 650 grand.
**Jdawson**: That's probably right on.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: The nexter improvements, asphalt paving, extending that drive, plus a parking lot.
**Jdawson**: 275.
**Jdawson**: It's not a big parking lot they have out there.
**Jdawson**: If you look at.
**Jdawson**: Look at this.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: Oops, sorry.
**Jdawson**: This is what it would be.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Sidewalks.
**Jdawson**: Then I just started plugging stuff.
**Jdawson**: 15 grand.
**Jdawson**: You know, you got the concrete ramp up into the building.
**Jdawson**: 30 grand.
**Bclymer**: We have a retaining wall.
**Jdawson**: No, I.
**Jdawson**: I didn't change.
**Jdawson**: I didn't know you could change.
**Jdawson**: This over here.
**Jdawson**: Just internal contingency site furnishing.
**Jdawson**: So this was going to be landscape.
**Jdawson**: We went through all that.
**Jdawson**: So we just bumped this up quite a bit.
**Bclymer**: The summary.
**Jdawson**: 7 million.
**Jdawson**: So that's what?
**Jdawson**: 7, 337.
**Jdawson**: 377 divided by 50,000.
**Jdawson**: 147 bucks a square foot.
**Bclymer**: What did I tell him?
**Jdawson**: I think you said 140.
**Jdawson**: Take the contingency out.
**Jdawson**: That's too expensive for 50,000 square foot building.
**Jdawson**: Don't you think?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I mean, keep the contingency in there, but just cut some stuff out.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Jdawson**: Let's go back.
**Jdawson**: Can I delete that?
**Jdawson**: We don't need this anymore.
**Bclymer**: Do you Correct.
**Bclymer**: You got a hundred thousand at exterior.
**Bclymer**: Remember you have 100,000 contingency.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: There we go.
**Bclymer**: We'll just start.
**Jdawson**: We started fluffing this up.
**Jdawson**: You want to keep.
**Jdawson**: Keep design the same.
**Jdawson**: Take this out.
**Jdawson**: That's probably too high.
**Jdawson**: But I don't know how long that road's going to be.
**Jdawson**: But we got to extend that road.
**Jdawson**: It's not gonna be cheap.
**Bclymer**: What road?
**Bclymer**: Talking about the front drive.
**Jdawson**: He says, yeah, this.
**Jdawson**: This drive out back here.
**Jdawson**: Or one of these drives were extended.
**Bclymer**: Should be the one, right?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, that's fine.
**Bclymer**: Just go.
**Bclymer**: Go back to your estimate.
**Bclymer**: Throw that down to 200.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Keep going.
**Jdawson**: More than enough.
**Jdawson**: Right?
**Jdawson**: I don't want to touch that.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Leave that.
**Bclymer**: Probably bring that down to 70.
**Jdawson**: 60.
**Jdawson**: There's a new bathroom.
**Bclymer**: I don't think they're gonna have a bathroom in there.
**Jdawson**: They have to.
**Bclymer**: No, they don't.
**Bclymer**: If it's gonna be connected to an existing building with one, they're gonna make you walk.
**Bclymer**: It's all going to be just for storage back there.
**Bclymer**: There's not going to be any people.
**Bclymer**: It's all where it's all storage.
**Jdawson**: We got contingency, so don't want to touch that.
**Jdawson**: Don't want to touch any of that.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Build out allowance.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, Take that down to 75.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Don't want to touch that.
**Bclymer**: Take your architectural features to 100.
**Jdawson**: Just call it out.
**Jdawson**: Right?
**Bclymer**: No, I mean, don't call it out.
**Bclymer**: Just.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Structural steel framing.
**Bclymer**: What's our summary at right now?
**Bclymer**: Where's that for the set?
**Jdawson**: Your 7 mil?
**Bclymer**: Let's see what that is.
**Jdawson**: 690-7123 divided by 51-23814.
**Jdawson**: Alrighty.
**Jdawson**: I'll type it up and then you can read through the clarifications in the PDF and if you have comments, be ready to go.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Good.
**Jdawson**: Jesse.
**Jdawson**: All good.
**Jdawson**: I'll get that.
**Jdawson**: I gotta focus on getting this.
**Jdawson**: JP's blowing me up for this change order pricing.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: All right, I'm gonna call Keba.
**Bclymer**: Yep, he's here.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: See him it.
