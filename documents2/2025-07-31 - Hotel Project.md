**Bclymer**: The.
**Bclymer**: The rubber strap I love.

**Josh.howard**: Do you have any aps?
**Josh.howard**: They got a lot of those rubber straps.
**Bclymer**: I do, I.
**Bclymer**: Well, I do, but it's an old rose gold that I don't ever wear and it doesn't go with a lot, but it was a gift to me for my wedding, so I kind of just store it, you know?
**Josh.howard**: Yeah, yeah, I know.
**Josh.howard**: I.
**Josh.howard**: My buddy of mine has, you know, he's a big watch guy.
**Josh.howard**: He loves the, the rubber strap, you know, like ceramic aps, which they're they're cool.
**Josh.howard**: Like, you know, I. I don't know.
**Josh.howard**: I'm.
**Josh.howard**: You know, I. I'm not as big of a fan of them.
**Josh.howard**: You know, I like the metal a little bit more.
**Josh.howard**: Like.
**Josh.howard**: Like, you know, like, you know, I've got a chrono ap, like, you know, silver, which I really like.
**Josh.howard**: And then my.

**Bclymer**: You're gonna.
**Bclymer**: You're gonna hurt for me.

**Bclymer**: Like, 165 for cash.
**Bclymer**: He's like, dude, it's too high.
**Bclymer**: He's like, I think I can get it for retail at like, 14 and a half.
**Bclymer**: 15.
**Bclymer**: I'm like, Bro, had, like, 20 set aside.
**Bclymer**: It's gonna be like.
**Bclymer**: It was just right timing, right?
**Bclymer**: Like, first big boy watch ready to go.
**Josh.howard**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: A month later, the world shuts down.
**Bclymer**: Six months later, Blueface aps are so grand.
**Bclymer**: You know, when that first spike and now they finally calm back down to, like, 35.
**Bclymer**: Dude, I can't get it.
**Bclymer**: I hate the watch.
**Bclymer**: I'll never.
**Bclymer**: I'll never get it.
**Bclymer**: Just on principle that I had it.
**Bclymer**: And he's like, yeah, that's the biggest miss.
**Bclymer**: You know, I. I can't believe, you know, I sent that.
**Josh.howard**: Yeah, my.
**Josh.howard**: I bought this.
**Josh.howard**: This attack.
**Josh.howard**: And I, like, I bought a tech.
**Josh.howard**: And like, a couple months before that, I had bought a Rolex.
**Josh.howard**: Why am I blanking on this?
**Josh.howard**: Yacht master, too?
**Josh.howard**: And, you know, a gold one, you know, and I think I bought another, like, AP earlier that year or whatever.
**Josh.howard**: Like, remember I bought the.
**Josh.howard**: The Patek, and I told my watch guy, I said, don't text me.
**Josh.howard**: Don't talk to me.
**Josh.howard**: I said, I'm not buying anything for a year.
**Josh.howard**: This.
**Josh.howard**: Not even six months later, hits me, hits me with these like, dude, I got your gold skeleton 194.
**Josh.howard**: That's.
**Josh.howard**: That's what I paid for it.
**Josh.howard**: That's retail.
**Josh.howard**: I had it sold to another guy, brand new.
**Bclymer**: Never been like, bro, didn't I just tell you?
**Josh.howard**: He's like.
**Josh.howard**: He's like, yeah, because it's never been worn.
**Josh.howard**: Like, my guy.
**Josh.howard**: The guy backed out on it.
**Josh.howard**: It's yours, you know, at my cost.
**Josh.howard**: And I'm like, I hate you.
**Josh.howard**: I. I have to pass.
**Josh.howard**: I made a commitment that I would, like.
**Josh.howard**: I have to tie watch purchases to.
**Josh.howard**: To big projects.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Josh.howard**: You know, period.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: The.
**Bclymer**: The.
**Bclymer**: The two guys.
**Bclymer**: The two.
**Bclymer**: The two brothers that own Broad street, they got On a good little kick when the deals just started getting a little crazy and got what they wanted, had a few, and now they're just like, it's so funny.
**Bclymer**: They both just rip Apple watches.
**Bclymer**: It's hilarious.
**Josh.howard**: Wow.
**Bclymer**: It's hilarious.
**Bclymer**: It's like.
**Bclymer**: It's just.
**Bclymer**: It's so funny.
**Bclymer**: They're like, oh, it was a face.
**Bclymer**: Because now, like, you know, mine's getting in a little.
**Bclymer**: You're in a great space, dude.
**Bclymer**: They just.
**Bclymer**: Lennar is coming in heavy.
**Bclymer**: I haven't told you that yet.
**Bclymer**: Like, heavy.
**Bclymer**: Heavy on Broad street, which is amazing.
**Josh.howard**: But then, you guys, I thought you sold.
**Josh.howard**: What do you mean?
**Bclymer**: We have.
**Bclymer**: We've sold 9, 000 lots to a group.
**Bclymer**: And then Lennar came and said, what's going on?
**Bclymer**: You didn't tell us about this.
**Bclymer**: We're like, we didn't.
**Bclymer**: We didn't have a global company.
**Bclymer**: They're like, well, we'll take 20,000 lots.
**Bclymer**: And we're like, come on.
**Bclymer**: Like, hold on.
**Josh.howard**: I thought that you sold, like, the entire company.
**Bclymer**: Well, we.
**Bclymer**: No, we only sold 30% of the lots to this group.
**Bclymer**: This.
**Josh.howard**: Oh, I see.
**Josh.howard**: But they were going to buy.
**Josh.howard**: They had a plan to buy the rest or something.
**Bclymer**: They still do.
**Bclymer**: They still want it.
**Bclymer**: And now their price keeps going up because Lennar's like, we're buying all of y'.
**Josh.howard**: All.
**Bclymer**: And we're like, no, we can't give you all of Broad street because we've already agreed to get, you know, to this group.
**Josh.howard**: I'd say, like, what's.
**Josh.howard**: Yeah.
**Josh.howard**: Did the other group, like, have a purchase agreement or something?
**Josh.howard**: Or is it just.
**Bclymer**: Hey, they wanted to.
**Bclymer**: They wanted to work together now.
**Bclymer**: So now they're, like, splitting 20, 000 lots.
**Josh.howard**: Lennar and these other guys, I mean, that's smart for them.
**Josh.howard**: Why?
**Josh.howard**: I've been each other 100.
**Josh.howard**: That's.
**Bclymer**: Well.
**Bclymer**: And it's smart.
**Bclymer**: It's smart on David's part, right?
**Bclymer**: He's like, do y' all really want to fight, or.
**Bclymer**: And, dude, he set up a dinner in Miami.
**Bclymer**: They both came.
**Josh.howard**: Nice.
**Bclymer**: And he's like, let's.
**Bclymer**: Let's do this.
**Bclymer**: And they're like, this doesn't surprise us at all.
**Bclymer**: We've already heard that you've done this before.
**Bclymer**: We knew about you in the industry, about David, about our CEO.
**Bclymer**: And he's like, what.
**Bclymer**: Why does this make any sense?
**Bclymer**: If one of y' all is going to give us 600, the other ones give 700.
**Bclymer**: What's the point?
**Bclymer**: Why not take.
**Bclymer**: It's.
**Bclymer**: It's 18000 lots roughly that you want 9000.
**Bclymer**: Why not take around 6, 650 a piece and like let's work it out and, and make it work to Yalls locations of like exactly thing.
**Bclymer**: So him opening that door, he's like I'm driving myself nuts, you know.
**Josh.howard**: So what.
**Josh.howard**: So you like, you mentioned like I'm in a good space but like I thought like it transferred to like some other thing or something like that.
**Josh.howard**: Like that was the whole.
**Bclymer**: The survey, the survey that came out still.
**Josh.howard**: I don't know whatever it is that I signed.
**Josh.howard**: Yeah, that was a not.
**Bclymer**: That was a non binding survey.
**Bclymer**: So we could get basically the taste of every investor.
**Bclymer**: And that's still happening.
**Bclymer**: The good thing is kind of twofold.
**Bclymer**: The bad thing is now another group wants more of Brush street of the lots which is still a good thing.
**Bclymer**: The other good thing is it just fast forwards your 3-4x even quicker.
**Bclymer**: If I'll be honest with you.
**Bclymer**: I think in the next year or two, depending on the amount of money comes in, they might take everyone out and give them a 3 or 4X, you know and just.
**Bclymer**: I mean we only owe, we only owe investors total right now is like 425 million.
**Josh.howard**: Do you know I should know this.
**Josh.howard**: How much did I put in with you?
**Josh.howard**: Do you happen to know that?
**Bclymer**: 250.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, 250.
**Josh.howard**: 250.
**Josh.howard**: 250.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Josh.howard**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I wish you would have done some more for you, I mean.
**Josh.howard**: Yeah.
**Josh.howard**: It is what it is, right?
**Josh.howard**: Like, I mean, no thanks.
**Josh.howard**: Like I put.
**Josh.howard**: I put my money in, in different deals.
**Josh.howard**: Like you know, so I'm not.
**Bclymer**: That's.
**Bclymer**: That wasn't like.
**Bclymer**: That wasn't me like pushing.
**Bclymer**: I just.
**Bclymer**: For all of us just.
**Bclymer**: Because now I know so much more.
**Bclymer**: You know what I mean?
**Josh.howard**: You wish you would have bought the.
**Bclymer**: AP before COVID No, dude, 100.
**Bclymer**: And I just had this feeling because remember I told you I put another 200 in and I'm like, my wife's like, why do we have no money?
**Bclymer**: I'm like, you just have to wait a little bit longer.
**Bclymer**: I'm like, you just got the.
**Bclymer**: You're just gonna have to wait.
**Bclymer**: I'm like, there's not many places where I know this can turn into potentially this pretty quickly, you know.
**Josh.howard**: Right.
**Bclymer**: But contender's great.
**Bclymer**: Okay, Josh just text me.
**Bclymer**: He's about to jump on.
**Bclymer**: We kind of talk through storage hotels.
**Bclymer**: He really wants you to look at the big project on the beach in Daytona.
**Bclymer**: The hotel.
**Bclymer**: It's going to be a really great project and maybe work on that some, the lagoon, of course.
**Bclymer**: So I just kind of said let's just jump on and, and walk through everything and then let Brandon look through, you know, a few different deals and just try and give us advice and give us pricing and see what he wants to work on.
**Josh.howard**: Yeah, we've got this down in Fort Myers.
**Josh.howard**: It's, it's a little over a billion dollar development.
**Josh.howard**: It's, it's got hotel, a bunch of condos, townhomes, man made island marina and stuff.
**Josh.howard**: You know, as soon as I can divulge all the details, like I'll give you.
**Josh.howard**: It's got like an 18 hole golf course and stuff like that.
**Josh.howard**: Like, I'll give you a shout and then you need to go gobble because it's, because, oh, I mean the, like all that real estate, it's very low right now.
**Josh.howard**: So you know, it's got a, it's got a shitty, you know, golf course that closed 20 years ago.
**Josh.howard**: The marina's got a bunch of sunk ships and stuff.
**Josh.howard**: It's like, it's just, it's destroyed from the hurricane.
**Josh.howard**: And so when, as soon as we announce like everything, then obviously it's going to skyrocket.
**Josh.howard**: And so it's like, so as soon as I can, you know, release info, like I'll give you a text and you guys need to go buy or.
**Bclymer**: WhatsApp me and call me.
**Josh.howard**: Yeah, yeah, you need to go buy as much around that, that area as possible, like on the golf course and everything.
**Josh.howard**: Because it's gonna, I mean, you can buy a house there for like, I mean 200 to 400,000.
**Josh.howard**: You know, they're gonna skyrocket once that goes up.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, it's, it's crazy.
**Bclymer**: It's just crazy what's, what's going on everywhere.
**Bclymer**: And I think, dude, you and I talked about this 15 months ago.
**Bclymer**: Just gonna get better.
**Bclymer**: Like this is just the start.
**Josh.howard**: Yeah, I think so.
**Josh.howard**: I mean, you know, they keep holding rates but it's, you know, and then the tariffs aren't hurting.
**Josh.howard**: Like, you know, they, they have been like, you know, everybody's skeptical, but he's doing something.
**Josh.howard**: You know, it's working.
**Josh.howard**: Like, I don't know if it's propped up or what, but he's, he's doing something to where he's getting foreign investment to where deals are going.
**Josh.howard**: And so even the slowdown in the residential real estate market and everything is still, the economy is booming because you've got these, you know, massive data centers and you know, power and Everything.
**Josh.howard**: So, like, the construction industry, which props up a ton of the economy, is still booming, you know, even with the slowdown in the residential side.
**Josh.howard**: Like, and it's.
**Josh.howard**: I mean, that makes for really, I mean, a perfect storm for guys like us.
**Bclymer**: Are you going to try and get into the data center space?
**Josh.howard**: Yeah, yeah, it's definitely something that we.
**Josh.howard**: I mean, because we build like warehouses a lot.
**Josh.howard**: Like.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Josh.howard**: And so it's a very close.
**Josh.howard**: I mean, it's the same type build, whether it be steel or depends on where you're building it.
**Josh.howard**: But I mean, it's steel or precast, tilt up, you know, it's really close.
**Josh.howard**: So, yeah, I mean, it's definitely something we.
**Josh.howard**: Plus we already have a division that does, like, infrastructure, and we have our own Sprint core division for robotics.
**Josh.howard**: So specifically these.
**Josh.howard**: You have these what's called ASRs system, which is a automatic sorting retrieval system.
**Josh.howard**: So when your wife buys something on Amazon, this robot goes into this really dense rack and picks it and then takes it out.
**Josh.howard**: And so, so we do all that, all the infrastructure, so the power.
**Josh.howard**: And then we, you know, create our own sprinkler division to do that stuff because it's so specialized and like two years ago or so, two and a half years ago, I took the time just to learn it and create a system.
**Josh.howard**: I mean, we, we just did one, the sprinkler system.
**Josh.howard**: Our bid was a million dollars.
**Josh.howard**: Second bid was like two and a half.
**Josh.howard**: You know, like, we've got, we've got one of these, an infrastructure proctor just like that in New Jersey.
**Josh.howard**: I think our number is like 3, 3, 3, 4.
**Josh.howard**: It's a Japanese company.
**Josh.howard**: They came over, they called us, they.
**Josh.howard**: They got other bids.
**Josh.howard**: One was like four or five, one was like six, one was nine.
**Josh.howard**: Like, it's like people have no idea what they're doing.
**Bclymer**: That's.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I, I don't, I don't even know.
**Bclymer**: I don't even know where it's going to go to.
**Bclymer**: Hearing, hearing Besant talk about the surplus in June and July, and we haven't been in the surplus since 2015.
**Bclymer**: We've run every month in a deficit since 2015.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, he's like, this is the first month we've been in a surplus and it wasn't a small one.
**Bclymer**: He was like, it was huge, you know, and, and our, like, David Feingold, our CEO, went to meet with like 12 people in Congress a few months ago.
**Bclymer**: And he just said, he said, all I can say is the group of people that he surrounded himself with, it has Nothing to do with politics and BS, which he did a little bit of that in 2016.
**Bclymer**: He's like, dude, this has only to do with business and doing business here in America.
**Bclymer**: And he was like, I had such a good feeling leaving.
**Bclymer**: Even though some of my meetings were cut short, people had to run into other stuff.
**Bclymer**: I got stood up a few times out of the 12 meetings.
**Bclymer**: He goes, it doesn't matter.
**Bclymer**: He goes, what they're doing, he's like.
**Bclymer**: And it's not just a push as much through in four years.
**Bclymer**: He's like, they're trying to make it to where this lasts for the next 40 years.
**Bclymer**: Like, what they're doing in the next four years.
**Bclymer**: I thought that was really cool.
**Bclymer**: And they're like, why do y' all have 60,000 acres?
**Bclymer**: How in the world did you get that amount of acreage?
**Bclymer**: And, like, what are you doing with it?
**Bclymer**: And we're like, well, we're only selling total, like, 22.
**Bclymer**: We're keeping the rest.
**Josh.howard**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Because we can carry it.
**Josh.howard**: What.
**Josh.howard**: What is Streams Development associated with you guys?
**Bclymer**: Streams?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Josh.howard**: Is that okay?
**Josh.howard**: So I saw them.
**Bclymer**: That's Kentucky.
**Josh.howard**: Okay.
**Josh.howard**: All right.
**Josh.howard**: Yeah.
**Josh.howard**: I didn't know.
**Josh.howard**: I didn't know what the thing.
**Bclymer**: They were like, Black Stream and then Streams.
**Bclymer**: And the only reason the name changed is there was a third partner.
**Bclymer**: So Josh Ford and a guy.
**Bclymer**: And, dude, he just, like, three years ago, he, like, took this out for a very small amount of money.
**Bclymer**: And he was older.
**Bclymer**: He kind of put a lot of money in for a long time and ran Blackstream.
**Bclymer**: And, dude, he just wanted out.
**Bclymer**: And.
**Bclymer**: But his name was tied to Blackstream and Streams, but he's not in contender.
**Bclymer**: And Contender is what David partially owns with Ford and Josh.
**Bclymer**: And Broad street owns a part of Contender, too.
**Josh.howard**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: You know, so Contender.
**Bclymer**: Contender is the, you know, the quote, unquote development leg, you know?
**Josh.howard**: Right.
**Josh.howard**: Yeah.
**Josh.howard**: When you.
**Josh.howard**: Contender was the.
**Josh.howard**: The ground stuff, you know, you know, all that.
**Josh.howard**: But I saw extremes put, and I was like, I wonder who that is.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, just another.
**Bclymer**: It's another, like, part of Contender.
**Bclymer**: We really tried to make Contender, like, really the infrastructure in the lots, you know.
**Josh.howard**: Yeah.
**Josh.howard**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And then Blackstream is a little more of, like, the commercial real estate, and they still have some real estate salesmen in there, and, like, there's some kind of stuff.
**Bclymer**: But, like, David wanted nothing to do with that.
**Bclymer**: Just because he's like, yalls margins suck.
**Bclymer**: Our margins are good.
**Bclymer**: Like, you know, he just kind of kept going.
**Bclymer**: I told him just to jump on the team.
**Bclymer**: She was Coming off a call.
**Bclymer**: But he also asked me, can you just call me?
**Bclymer**: But that was it, like 1:30.
**Bclymer**: What type.
**Josh.howard**: Of.
**Bclymer**: He says, hopping on in just a second.
**Bclymer**: Cool.
**Bclymer**: What else do you have going on?
**Bclymer**: Do you have a lot of projects right now or just a few big ones?
**Bclymer**: I know you told me about a few big ones you're working on.
**Bclymer**: Did I break up a little bit?
**Josh.howard**: Yeah, sorry.
**Bclymer**: I was just saying, are you just working on these few big ones or do you all have a lot of stuff going on right now or what?
**Josh.howard**: Oh, no, it's.
**Josh.howard**: Is it my Internet?
**Bclymer**: No, dude, it's probably mine.
**Bclymer**: Just because we're in a store, we have a storm right now where I am.
**Josh.howard**: Yeah, we'll see.
**Josh.howard**: I just plug something, so we'll see if that works.
**Josh.howard**: No, so we.
**Josh.howard**: I mean, that we've got a, you know, that big one.
**Josh.howard**: We've got, you know, we're pretty diverse as far as like, you know, from, you know, a billion dollar down to like, you know, stuff is half a million, you know, like tis and whatnot.
**Josh.howard**: But yeah, I mean, we're, you know, we're staying.
**Josh.howard**: Staying busy.
**Josh.howard**: You know, a lot of our stuff, like, we're very fortunate that like that infrastructure stuff that we do is.
**Josh.howard**: It's good margin and extremely low manpower for us.
**Josh.howard**: So like one guy can run like four or five jobs like, you know, on the office side, you know, pretty easy.
**Josh.howard**: Yeah.
**Josh.howard**: You know, and then you just got, you know, guy on site.
**Josh.howard**: Right.
**Josh.howard**: Obviously the labor guys.
**Josh.howard**: But yeah, so that's.
**Josh.howard**: That helps a lot to have that.
**Bclymer**: Are you subbing all that?
**Bclymer**: You sell all the labor stuff out?
**Josh.howard**: Yeah.
**Josh.howard**: So what we do is we put a superintendent on site and then.
**Josh.howard**: Because we do it all over the country.
**Josh.howard**: And so what we'll do is like we.
**Josh.howard**: We source all the materials.
**Josh.howard**: You know, we have our own design.
**Josh.howard**: So we do the design, source of materials, and then we'll get with whatever local labor, and it's great.
**Josh.howard**: Or it's great for those guys because as you know, most times subs.
**Josh.howard**: The worst thing they have is they don't know how to manage cash flow.
**Josh.howard**: And so, you know, we.
**Josh.howard**: We'll buy the, you know, million dollars or whatever material.
**Josh.howard**: Right.
**Josh.howard**: And then they don't have to worry about it.
**Josh.howard**: They're like, wait a minute.
**Josh.howard**: I just can work and make my margin, you know, on the labor.
**Josh.howard**: And it's like, that's huge for them.
**Josh.howard**: They don't have to worry about submittals, any of that stuff.
**Josh.howard**: They show up and work and, you know, get Paid in.
**Josh.howard**: Some of them, like they'll ask to get paid every two weeks and I'll have them knock percents off, you know, to pay him early.
**Josh.howard**: Fine with me.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, 100%.
**Bclymer**: And when is your next call?
**Bclymer**: 3:30.
**Bclymer**: We have time, right?
**Josh.howard**: Yeah, I don't have another one scheduled.
**Josh.howard**: Yeah, it looks like.
**Bclymer**: Obviously you can imagine things are a little bit crazy.
**Josh.howard**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: The crypto deal is a little crazy.
**Josh.howard**: It's.
**Bclymer**: I think it's going to be.
**Josh.howard**: What's it up to now?
**Bclymer**: See here, PT those coins at like 22.
**Bclymer**: But we just got.
**Bclymer**: I'll send you so you.
**Bclymer**: I mean, if you want to read it.
**Josh.howard**: 117 for Bitcoin.
**Bclymer**: I mean, I don't know.
**Bclymer**: I mean we're doing.
**Bclymer**: Are you on WhatsApp or no?
**Josh.howard**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, that's right.
**Bclymer**: That's how many.
**Bclymer**: It's pretty interesting because we had.
**Bclymer**: Because we had such, you know, we.
**Bclymer**: We're the largest dogecoin miner in the whole United States, so.
**Josh.howard**: Because we're the largest.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: Didn't know that because we were the largest.
**Bclymer**: So funny.
**Bclymer**: The DOJ was like, no, no, you have to come to us as well.
**Bclymer**: And we're going.
**Bclymer**: We're a private company doing a reverse merger with a shell company on the NASDAQ that wants to merge into.
**Bclymer**: That wants us to take over completely.
**Bclymer**: And the DOJ is like, we need to look through things.
**Bclymer**: We're like, okay, great, here's 9,000 machines.
**Bclymer**: Here's 9,000 barcodes of every single machine and we're going to turn them back on and reverse merge.
**Bclymer**: They're like, the DOJ checks off on C on Z squared.
**Bclymer**: Making sure the Doge is under control is like what they release.
**Bclymer**: We're like, they didn't check.
**Bclymer**: They literally just wanted to put an article out just because of all that's behind Dogecoin and Elon and all that.
**Bclymer**: Like, it's so hilarious.
**Bclymer**: Like, no other private company goes.
**Bclymer**: Has to go through the doj, you know, like.
**Josh.howard**: But that's making just government trying to look busy.
**Bclymer**: That's it.
**Bclymer**: Trying to look busy is all.
**Bclymer**: And it should be.
**Bclymer**: COEP is the ticker that's merging.
**Bclymer**: I just sent you the article on.
**Bclymer**: On WhatsApp, but I think that's.
**Bclymer**: I mean the value is low in my opinion.
**Bclymer**: And it's only 9,000 machines that we're going public with and we have 25,000 machines right now.
**Josh.howard**: That's epic.
**Bclymer**: They're mine.
**Bclymer**: So it's.
**Bclymer**: I don't know, dude, it's.
**Bclymer**: It's one of those where, you know, like yourself and the other guys, like, dude, David's just ahead and he just thinks.
**Bclymer**: He just seems to think and be ahead with his contacts and people and Wall street and he's who he's got to be.
**Josh.howard**: He's got to be on the billion dollar door.
**Josh.howard**: Right?
**Bclymer**: I mean, dude, with.
**Bclymer**: With two groups trying to give you 650 plus whatever this merger is going to do on the public.
**Bclymer**: I mean, the valuation came in at 660.
**Bclymer**: He still owns a lot of that, you know, and, I mean, he owns 50 million in machines that he's going to sell into the company to merge.
**Bclymer**: So, yeah, he'll be there.
**Bclymer**: It's just really cool that you would never know and you don't.
**Bclymer**: Like, you know, he's on the call this morning, like, bullshitting and making fun of guys and just, like, playing around, you know, and, dude, he's all over it.
**Bclymer**: And if.
**Bclymer**: If Broad street were to really sell for 6 or 7 billion, which is probably where we're, like, valued at.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: It'd be.
**Bclymer**: You wouldn't just have a billion, you know, Right.
**Bclymer**: Freaking Joe and Stephen would each have a billion, which would be insane.
**Bclymer**: 2.
**Bclymer**: Two football players from Niagara Falls that.
**Josh.howard**: You know, it's just crazy to think about, man.
**Josh.howard**: Like.
**Josh.howard**: Like when you.
**Josh.howard**: When you do the.
**Josh.howard**: The math, like, you know, have you ever heard, like, you know, a million seconds is like 11 days, you know, and then like a billion seconds is something like 30 years, 32 and a half years.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: We did it this morning because my.
**Bclymer**: Hold on, Josh.
**Bclymer**: What's up?
**Bclymer**: It's easier.
**Bclymer**: And I just call you real quick.
**Bclymer**: You want me just to offer it to him if he's in the car?
**Bclymer**: Because I think he's in the car.
**Bclymer**: I'm talking.
**Josh.howard**: Yeah, Just.
**Josh.howard**: Just to put him through.
**Bclymer**: You know what I mean?
**Josh.howard**: Yeah, yeah.
**Josh.howard**: Whatever works, man.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Check your phone.
**Josh.howard**: Hey, what's up?
**Josh.howard**: Well, Josh, how are you?
**Josh.howard**: Good.
**Josh.howard**: Well, I mean, talking to Case and like, you know, first of all, congratulations.
**Josh.howard**: You guys are.
**Josh.howard**: Got some big deals come through.
**Josh.howard**: I mean, something to celebrate for sure.
**Josh.howard**: Yeah.
**Josh.howard**: No, it's been.
**Josh.howard**: It's been.
**Josh.howard**: We've been very.
**Josh.howard**: We've worked hard, but been very fortunate at the same time.
**Josh.howard**: And sometimes you make your own luck in that way, so.
**Josh.howard**: Door comes knocking when you're prepared.
**Josh.howard**: That's right.
**Josh.howard**: That was exactly right.
**Josh.howard**: So we've.
**Josh.howard**: It's been good.
**Josh.howard**: It's been very good.
**Josh.howard**: So.
**Josh.howard**: And of course, you know, working with Casen and everybody else over at the Broad street team has Always been a.
**Josh.howard**: Something we have enjoyed.
**Josh.howard**: So at the end of the day, it's been a.
**Josh.howard**: It's been a good partnership between our two.
**Josh.howard**: Our two firms.
**Josh.howard**: So.
**Josh.howard**: And it continues to be a good partnership.
**Josh.howard**: But.
**Josh.howard**: Well, tell me what's going on with you guys?
**Josh.howard**: What are you.
**Josh.howard**: What kind of projects are you looking at?
**Josh.howard**: What are you, what are you working on?
**Josh.howard**: Yeah, I mean we're, you know, all over the country.
**Josh.howard**: I'd say the, the biggest one that takes up most of my time is, you know, telling Kayson about it.
**Josh.howard**: We've got a.
**Josh.howard**: It's a little over a billion dollar deal down in Fort Myers area.
**Josh.howard**: It's.
**Josh.howard**: It's got a.
**Josh.howard**: It's a man made island and Marina.
**Josh.howard**: 18 hole golf course with club and then it's got like a hotel on it, you know, a few mixed use buildings and then you know, a couple 600 or 300 condos, a bunch of townhomes and a couple other big condo towers.
**Josh.howard**: So that's kind of my, that's my big one that I, you know, I spend a lot of time on just because, you know, not only I'm on the, the ownership side, but the, you know, the building side of it.
**Josh.howard**: So it takes a lot of my time.
**Josh.howard**: Oh, wow.
**Josh.howard**: Okay.
**Josh.howard**: That's.
**Josh.howard**: That's really.
**Josh.howard**: That's.
**Josh.howard**: That is pretty significant there.
**Josh.howard**: Yeah.
**Josh.howard**: That's awesome.
**Josh.howard**: So what, what aspects of that are y' all building right now?
**Josh.howard**: It's still.
**Josh.howard**: We're still.
**Josh.howard**: Are you GC in the whole thing?
**Josh.howard**: Yeah, we're GC in the whole thing.
**Josh.howard**: Okay, gotcha.
**Josh.howard**: Yeah, it's.
**Josh.howard**: It's.
**Josh.howard**: We're design bill of the whole thing.
**Josh.howard**: So you know, we though the whole thing is underneath our, our purview.
**Josh.howard**: Okay.
**Josh.howard**: Okay.
**Josh.howard**: That's pretty.
**Josh.howard**: Yeah.
**Josh.howard**: Who built, who did the island?
**Josh.howard**: Did y' all do the island?
**Josh.howard**: Yeah, I mean we.
**Josh.howard**: It's not done yet, but I mean.
**Josh.howard**: Yeah, it's.
**Josh.howard**: So we're.
**Josh.howard**: Yeah, we're still.
**Josh.howard**: We're still working through design and stuff.
**Josh.howard**: So we'll break ground and I don't know, February, March time frame.
**Josh.howard**: Built an island, but we're trying to design one.
**Josh.howard**: Is it stretching?
**Josh.howard**: Is that how.
**Josh.howard**: Well, so, so there's an existing.
**Josh.howard**: There's an existing marina.
**Josh.howard**: So what, what we do is like you, you like basically like that where you'll come in and you will build our.
**Josh.howard**: Where our seawall is going to be, right?
**Josh.howard**: And then you just take it and you dredge and cut all the way around where you're going to have water, you know, which you know, on the, you know, I'll say the plan south side, it's just tidal lagoons and everything.
**Josh.howard**: And then you've got the.
**Josh.howard**: The golf course on the back end.
**Josh.howard**: So like, if you know anything about tidal lagoons and water, like a title is simply just to.
**Josh.howard**: To clean, you know, and water goes in and out as the tide rises.
**Josh.howard**: It helps keep the.
**Josh.howard**: The marina area clean and whatnot.
**Josh.howard**: Water.
**Josh.howard**: It's all about water quality.
**Josh.howard**: And so that's actually very shallow.
**Josh.howard**: It's only like, I don't know, 18 inches to 2 foot deep.
**Josh.howard**: And you know, it slopes and it's got grass and stuff in it.
**Josh.howard**: And then, yeah, the, the actual.
**Josh.howard**: The.
**Josh.howard**: The marina will I think, triple in size from what it is now.
**Josh.howard**: And so, yeah, all that's just.
**Josh.howard**: We'll literally just take all that, dig all that dirt out.
**Josh.howard**: And then, you know, a lot of it obviously is not structural fill.
**Josh.howard**: So then what we do is like.
**Josh.howard**: I was talking with the.
**Josh.howard**: Our golf course architect the other day and I was like, hey.
**Josh.howard**: I was like, the worst thing about golf in Florida is there's no elevation change.
**Josh.howard**: I was like, so I really want to take this crappy dirt and really pile up some cool tee boxes and elevated greens and whatnot.
**Josh.howard**: So try to make it more appetizing to a golfer long enough.
**Josh.howard**: The biggest thing with it is working with the Army Corps of Engineers, you know, because they're dealing with the waterways and so getting all those entitlements and stuff, you know, and then the.
**Josh.howard**: It's.
**Josh.howard**: It's the density numbers as far as the.
**Josh.howard**: The city goes.
**Josh.howard**: Right.
**Josh.howard**: And what they want and hitting those metrics.
**Josh.howard**: But you know, it's also.
**Josh.howard**: They want the improvement.
**Josh.howard**: Like the, you know, the area is hammered by the hurricane, so it's like, you know, that it's just disastrous.
**Josh.howard**: Like, you know, and so the value that we're bringing there know really going to work with this because it's.
**Josh.howard**: It's like, hey guys, the numbers have to work for us to do this.
**Josh.howard**: Right?
**Josh.howard**: So we.
**Josh.howard**: We need to, you know, get these density numbers.
**Josh.howard**: Well, it's always helpful in permitting if you actually have the politicians and jurisdictions behind you, too.
**Josh.howard**: So that's good.
**Josh.howard**: Yeah.
**Josh.howard**: And it just depends because the.
**Josh.howard**: The issue with.
**Josh.howard**: With it is, is, you know, this.
**Josh.howard**: They obviously this takes, you know, we.
**Josh.howard**: This has been in the works for a bit and elections happen, so that's always the challenge.
**Josh.howard**: Now the good news is that the people in the department don't change, but often.
**Josh.howard**: But the council changes.
**Josh.howard**: Yeah.
**Josh.howard**: Two bridges.
**Josh.howard**: Yeah.
**Josh.howard**: We're kind of in and out.
**Josh.howard**: So we're, we're just flying down that morning, flying back that evening.
**Josh.howard**: Oh yeah, but I'll.
**Josh.howard**: Where's that?
**Josh.howard**: Is it out in the bay or is it.
**Josh.howard**: No, no, this is down in Fort Myers area.
**Josh.howard**: Fort Myers area.
**Josh.howard**: Okay, okay, I gotcha.
**Josh.howard**: Yeah, that area has gotten hammered lately.
**Josh.howard**: Exactly.
**Josh.howard**: Yep.
**Josh.howard**: Absolutely.
**Josh.howard**: But the growth, the growth is, is, is huge down there.
**Josh.howard**: Like I, you know, you know, big reason I opened up an office in Tampa is because when I look at the way that things are growing and where it's growing is, you know, if you go to the east, east coast of Florida, you know, really from West Palm down to Miami, it's really just one big city.
**Josh.howard**: Right.
**Josh.howard**: Like it's just boom, boom, boom.
**Josh.howard**: Especially when you get down to Fort Lauderdale.
**Josh.howard**: Like it's just literally nothing.
**Josh.howard**: I mean, you don't even know a change.
**Josh.howard**: And I think the same thing is going to happen, you know, because you've got Tampa soda and then you've got a huge gap until you get down to like Port Charlotte, Fort Myers and stuff.
**Josh.howard**: And I think all that's just going to keep building together.
**Josh.howard**: Yeah, no, I can see that.
**Josh.howard**: I can see that.
**Josh.howard**: Remind me where you make home base.
**Josh.howard**: Where are you at?
**Josh.howard**: So I, I actually have a place in Tampa and a place in Indy, so I split time between the two.
**Josh.howard**: Um, I really kind of go where I am needed.
**Josh.howard**: Like, you know, I'm up in Indian Suite because we had a topping out ceremony, you know, just you know, on the north side here.
**Josh.howard**: And then, then I'll have a grand opening for a school.
**Josh.howard**: We finished, you know, I think Tuesday, so I, you know, it makes sense for me to be up here.
**Josh.howard**: Gotcha.
**Josh.howard**: Maybe all of us need to get together somewhere sometimes.
**Josh.howard**: Yeah, I think we should, we can all.
**Josh.howard**: It's all meet in person.
**Josh.howard**: That might be.
**Josh.howard**: You know, we've talked on the phone a couple of times but everybody, you know, gets busy and you kind of move on.
**Josh.howard**: Yeah, I know.
**Josh.howard**: I, I just, I think Brandon can help us some too and help you in Ford.
**Josh.howard**: I know you and I talked a little bit about maybe Daytona.
**Josh.howard**: He's done a bunch of hotel builds and you know, I think definitely looking down there could be because I'm thinking in terms of that AC project, we've had a, we're not committed to anybody, but we've had a.
**Josh.howard**: There is a contractor that has been kind of working along the way, probably hopeful of getting the contract and I'm not saying, but at the same time we've not traditionally just to Be honest with you, I have not.
**Josh.howard**: I know you guys like to work on.
**Josh.howard**: I have not traditionally run into.
**Josh.howard**: Or maybe I just haven't partnered with the right people.
**Josh.howard**: I've not traditionally run into design build situations where I was very happy.
**Josh.howard**: And, and that's probably just wrong partner, to be honest with you.
**Josh.howard**: But it's a.
**Josh.howard**: And so what we've traditionally kind of done is we will have a party who's willing, you know, we'll pay them for their time and everything and they'll help us kind of through the design process through ve and everything like that.
**Josh.howard**: Yeah, Design assist is what we call that.
**Josh.howard**: Yeah, yeah, I'll try.
**Josh.howard**: Yeah.
**Josh.howard**: And so.
**Josh.howard**: And we would.
**Josh.howard**: And so that's kind of traditionally the way we've done it.
**Josh.howard**: But then at the end, just to keep everybody honest, we'll do a.
**Josh.howard**: We'll usually bring in maybe one other party to kind of bid it, take a look.
**Josh.howard**: And, and that gives us an opportunity to kind of just make sure.
**Josh.howard**: But that's, that's the way we kind of run it traditionally.
**Josh.howard**: But I was trying to think.
**Josh.howard**: We went off course one time with one contractor.
**Josh.howard**: I'm not saying it was their issue, but we, we decided at that point just to go in and redesign the structure and try to build it, try to design it a little less expensive than what it was.
**Josh.howard**: And so, and, but then the other one, like the Ormond beach project, we've.
**Josh.howard**: That's gone well, we, that's Kellogg, Kenzie on that one and they've done a good job on that project.
**Josh.howard**: But maybe a good meeting spot.
**Josh.howard**: Casey would be.
**Josh.howard**: Is.
**Josh.howard**: Is I can get, you know, maybe bring Adam with us and meet down in Daytona somewhere.
**Josh.howard**: And where's home base for you?
**Josh.howard**: Or, or we can meet in Tampa, which is much better place, or Fort Myers and talk about Daytona so we don't have to meet Daytona.
**Josh.howard**: Or we can do.
**Josh.howard**: Or we can do that and you can show me this island you're building.
**Josh.howard**: That'd be fun.
**Josh.howard**: Well, that's down for.
**Josh.howard**: That's down in Fort Myers.
**Josh.howard**: It's a little drive.
**Josh.howard**: Fort Myers is easy for me.
**Josh.howard**: About two hours from Brandon and you can fly in.
**Josh.howard**: Josh.
**Josh.howard**: Josh, where's home base for you?
**Josh.howard**: Is it.
**Josh.howard**: Is Columbia or South Carolina?
**Josh.howard**: Yeah.
**Josh.howard**: So we, you know, Port Wentworth, Georgia.
**Josh.howard**: So we've got, we've got a hotel getting ready to break ground there too, actually.
**Josh.howard**: Just, it's like a, it's not nothing crazy 40 million dollar, you know, hotel.
**Josh.howard**: And then it's got like this like big outdoor area thing, but Yeah, I say that'd be a.
**Josh.howard**: That I. I can't remember.
**Josh.howard**: I don't know how far Savannah is from.
**Josh.howard**: From Greenville.
**Josh.howard**: Savannah is about.
**Josh.howard**: Oh, okay.
**Josh.howard**: A little bit farther than what I thought I was thinking was closer.
**Josh.howard**: Okay.
**Josh.howard**: Greenville is all the way northwest.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, Gotcha.
**Josh.howard**: Gotcha.
**Josh.howard**: I see it.
**Josh.howard**: Okay.
**Josh.howard**: Yeah, I got it.
**Josh.howard**: Oh.
**Josh.howard**: So, yeah, you guys always fly out of Charlotte then?
**Josh.howard**: Makes sense.
**Josh.howard**: But, yeah, no, definitely like to meet in person when, like I said, we can go, you know, Tampa, you know, Fort Myers, Daytona, Fort Lauderdale.
**Josh.howard**: Doesn't really matter.
**Josh.howard**: Yeah, let's figure that out, man.
**Josh.howard**: I think that's.
**Josh.howard**: Like I said, Casey and I think we've.
**Josh.howard**: We've done a lot of talking.
**Josh.howard**: It might be easier to sit down.
**Josh.howard**: Yeah, let's pull a project out, take a look at it, get Brandon's thoughts on it, and see if there's a.
**Josh.howard**: See what the pathway looks like from there.
**Josh.howard**: So.
**Josh.howard**: Because, you know, like I said, I. I know a lot about your company already.
**Josh.howard**: I kind of looked it up and everything, and I appreciate what you know about mine.
**Josh.howard**: And.
**Josh.howard**: And you guys are solid, solid quality constructor.
**Josh.howard**: And so.
**Josh.howard**: And.
**Josh.howard**: And, you know, it's.
**Josh.howard**: You're absolutely the type of company we do business with.
**Josh.howard**: So at the end of the day.
**Josh.howard**: So I think maybe best thing to do is just, let's get.
**Josh.howard**: Let's sit down, let's have dinner together, let's open up a project, take a look at it and see where we go from there.
**Josh.howard**: Certainly.
**Josh.howard**: And just.
**Josh.howard**: Just a little bit.
**Josh.howard**: Josh.
**Josh.howard**: I know that you guys do a lot of different things.
**Josh.howard**: We, you know, I don't want to do anything that we don't typically do.
**Josh.howard**: Like, I say that, but.
**Josh.howard**: But here we are, like, I think we're doing like, four or five, like, custom homes, but that's simply just because literally, one of the developers called my COO that we work with, we've worked with three years, and he's like, hey, will you please build these houses for me?
**Josh.howard**: And, like, I was like, dude, we don't build houses.
**Josh.howard**: But, I mean, you're not going to say no to a guy who gives you, you know, $150 million projects.
**Josh.howard**: So we're building the house now, but I don't want to do that.
**Josh.howard**: But, like, storage units, like, have we done them?
**Josh.howard**: Yes, but it is not something that it's not.
**Josh.howard**: I mean, it's not complicated enough to.
**Josh.howard**: To.
**Josh.howard**: For us to bring value to the honest.
**Josh.howard**: Like, it just isn't.
**Josh.howard**: You know, we.
**Josh.howard**: We do warehouses because we can throw them up really fast.
**Josh.howard**: Like, it's literally, I like to have a contest to see how fast we can do it.
**Josh.howard**: Yeah.
**Josh.howard**: But yeah, in the, the hospitality, you know, condominium, that kind of stuff.
**Josh.howard**: That's more of where we can bring some actual, you know, value.
**Josh.howard**: Well, so that's what I was saying.
**Josh.howard**: Let's look at a hotel then.
**Josh.howard**: Okay.
**Josh.howard**: So I mean, because we've got, we've got that one.
**Josh.howard**: We've got.
**Josh.howard**: And so let's, let's just take a look.
**Josh.howard**: I think that's a good one to look at right now.
**Josh.howard**: Certainly.
**Josh.howard**: And, and we, we actually have one in North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina that has nobody attached to it right now.
**Josh.howard**: That's a perfect one.
**Josh.howard**: We can bring, we just bring them both.
**Josh.howard**: And let's take a look at those.
**Josh.howard**: Yeah, both are Marriott branded projects.
**Josh.howard**: One's.
**Josh.howard**: The one in North Myrtle is a residence in.
**Josh.howard**: The one in Daytona is an ac.
**Josh.howard**: So do you guys take investors on yours or you just finance it all yourself?
**Josh.howard**: Not you guys, if you guys like.
**Josh.howard**: We've got, we've got a GC investing with us.
**Josh.howard**: He actually, we got a project in Columbia, South Carolina.
**Josh.howard**: The gc.
**Josh.howard**: The GC is actually the one.
**Josh.howard**: The GC who built our element in North Charleston is the one who put us in touch with the seller of the property in Columbia.
**Josh.howard**: Oh, nice.
**Josh.howard**: And so to reward him, he also wanted to invest in it.
**Josh.howard**: So we were like, well, if you're willing to invest in it, then we're willing to, we'll develop it.
**Josh.howard**: Right.
**Josh.howard**: And because that tells me a lot about your belief in this project.
**Josh.howard**: So.
**Josh.howard**: And yeah, so we will take, you know, we love, we love having direct investment with our gcs.
**Josh.howard**: Yeah, I mean we, we do it or I say, let me be clear, Omido as a company does not do it.
**Josh.howard**: Me personally as the owner and Brandon Clymer, I invest.
**Josh.howard**: So I, I don't take Alito funds and invest it.
**Josh.howard**: I do it, you know, separately.
**Josh.howard**: Well, that's, that's exactly the way when I say gc, he's individually in the, in the deal.
**Josh.howard**: Yeah, like you're individually in the deal.
**Josh.howard**: And we've got, we actually have a company that we've done a multi family project with and that GC individually, he's got his own family office and they eventually invest in the deal, that kind of thing.
**Josh.howard**: So.
**Josh.howard**: Yeah, but yeah, that's something that we do with, you know, a few of our developers, you know, and again, it's more along the lines of happy to do it.
**Josh.howard**: But I also, it's not a requirement.
**Josh.howard**: I don't want to take somebody else's spot, so that's why I always ask.
**Josh.howard**: Sure.
**Josh.howard**: Well, no, it's, it's, it's certainly something that is available there and I like it because it keeps us aligned in many, many ways.
**Josh.howard**: Totally.
**Josh.howard**: So cool.
**Josh.howard**: Well, yeah, we can find a Tampa for Myers.
**Josh.howard**: Either one, you know, go.
**Josh.howard**: Why don't you two get together and tell me where to show up to?
**Josh.howard**: Yep, we'll do that.
**Josh.howard**: And I'll.
**Josh.howard**: And then we'll pick a date and we'll, we'll come down.
**Josh.howard**: Certainly.
**Josh.howard**: Real quick.
**Josh.howard**: Just kind of.
**Josh.howard**: It's hilarious.
**Josh.howard**: This came across my desk, actually, from my brother yesterday, just to both of y'.
**Josh.howard**: All.
**Josh.howard**: It's kind of interesting.
**Josh.howard**: One of his clients has 800 acres.
**Josh.howard**: Josh, in Hickory on a lake.
**Josh.howard**: There you go.
**Josh.howard**: Okay.
**Josh.howard**: Hickory, North Carolina or Hickory.
**Josh.howard**: It's just Western Hickory.
**Josh.howard**: Yeah, it's a lake.
**Josh.howard**: And he has, he owns.
**Josh.howard**: The guy owns all 800 acres I think he got from his grandpa or something on the lake.
**Josh.howard**: And Josh, it just, it makes me think of the, you know, kiwi and the reserve so much like those two guys owning like, basically all the reserve, you know, from Jupiter.
**Josh.howard**: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Josh.howard**: I don't know.
**Josh.howard**: I was just going to shoot it to you.
**Josh.howard**: It's not a crazy number.
**Josh.howard**: I mean, it's 800 acres on the lake for 20 million.
**Josh.howard**: But he has the whole thing, you know, right now, so it's kind of crazy.
**Josh.howard**: Yeah, that's not, that's not crazy at all.
**Josh.howard**: Well, what's this?
**Josh.howard**: What do you want to do with it?
**Josh.howard**: Does he want to.
**Josh.howard**: Does he what?
**Josh.howard**: Let's say, does he want to sell it or like a lot of times, like, like.
**Josh.howard**: So, for instance, like when we do a lot of land guys, they'll come in and they'll want to throw their land in the deal, you know, as the, as the, as their portion, and then, you know, develop it.
**Josh.howard**: Oh, there's a.
**Josh.howard**: There's two or three homes on it.
**Josh.howard**: There's one big one that he built 12, 000 square foot house on it that's included.
**Josh.howard**: And I think he just wants to get rid of all the land.
**Josh.howard**: But I think they have money, so it's not a. I don't know.
**Josh.howard**: My brother's going to be with me in the next hour or two and I'm going to ask for a little more about it just because it's not that far.
**Josh.howard**: It's not that far from Charlotte, it's not that far from Asheville.
**Josh.howard**: I mean, Hickory's not far, you know, well, the fact that it's on a lake, Send it over to me, that'd be awesome.
**Josh.howard**: I will.
**Josh.howard**: Because it's really a pocket deal right now.
**Josh.howard**: No one really knows.
**Josh.howard**: I mean, the guy should be after 40 or 50 million for, you know, 800 acres on the lake.
**Josh.howard**: You know, it's developable.
**Josh.howard**: Yeah, dude, how much can you tell how much frontage it has?
**Josh.howard**: That's what I'm gonna get all the details from.
**Josh.howard**: I mean, it's one of my brother's clients that has, it's their property, so they just might not even know.
**Josh.howard**: But we've done so much of that, Josh, you know, where people, guys just don't know.
**Josh.howard**: Well, the best thing is that lake.
**Josh.howard**: I just pulled it up here.
**Josh.howard**: It connects to Norman, it connects to Lake Hickory.
**Josh.howard**: And it connects to, I'll tell you the exact name of it.
**Josh.howard**: Look at, so look at Lake Hickory.
**Josh.howard**: And then look, just look.
**Josh.howard**: Just west of it.
**Josh.howard**: It's R H O D I S S Lake.
**Josh.howard**: Yeah.
**Josh.howard**: Which connects all the way down to Lake Norman.
**Josh.howard**: Yep.
**Josh.howard**: So it's 800 acres on road.
**Josh.howard**: His lake, broadest lake.
**Josh.howard**: I don't really know how to say it, but this 15 minutes from Hickory, I'm thinking, dude, this guy's either sitting on a landmine, I mean a landmine, or, you know, gold.
**Josh.howard**: A gold mine.
**Josh.howard**: Yeah.
**Josh.howard**: Hopefully a gold mine, you know, but I'll know more about it and I know Brandon's got to jump off to a 3:30.

**Josh.howard**: Falling, Nick are just killing it.
**Josh.howard**: And I have four or five guys that are about to come into that, you know, space as well.
**Josh.howard**: And I'll kind of fill Brandon in.
