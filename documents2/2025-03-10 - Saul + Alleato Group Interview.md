**Bclymer**: Sa.
**Saulrwilson**: So do they usually join via the recruiter or they sign in on their own?
**Bclymer**: I mean they've got a hotmail on here so I'm assuming they sign in there.
**Saulrwilson**: I see this meeting while we wait.
**Saulrwilson**: I see this meeting from just Jesse for the company's ops meeting.
**Saulrwilson**: Would you like.
**Saulrwilson**: Do I need to attend that?
**Bclymer**: Probably not.
**Bclymer**: What time does that mean?
**Saulrwilson**: 6:30 my time.
**Saulrwilson**: I think it's like 7:30 your time.
**Bclymer**: What day?
**Saulrwilson**: Wednesday the 12th.
**Saulrwilson**: March 12th.
**Saulrwilson**: I can if you need me to.
**Saulrwilson**: That's not a problem.
**Bclymer**: No, I just don't know why I don't see it on my calendar.
**Bclymer**: The company ops meeting is.
**Bclymer**: I got one at 7:30am yeah, I'm an hour.
**Saulrwilson**: I'm an hour behind.
**Saulrwilson**: I'm in Houston, so she was at 6:30 my time.
**Bclymer**: Gotcha.
**Bclymer**: Hey Matthew.
**Bclymer**: Hey, it's Brandon.
**Bclymer**: Is Saul not coming to the interview anymore?
**Bclymer**: I don't know.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: And then I guess it's.
**Bclymer**: Why don't you go ahead and confirm that the other person.
**Bclymer**: If the other person's going to show up to the next one.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right, we'll give it.
**Bclymer**: All right, we'll give it few more minutes, then we'll jump out.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, thank.
**Bclymer**: The guy's like.
**Bclymer**: He goes, they have daylight savings too, right?
**Bclymer**: I'm like, I don't know.
**Saulrwilson**: Oh, you know what?
**Saulrwilson**: That's probably it because I wasn't seeing it on my calendar.
**Saulrwilson**: And then I don't know if Maria sent it, but she made a comment about it being on Colombian time.
**Bclymer**: I mean, mine showed up normal.
**Saulrwilson**: Yeah, because I accepted it last week, but I wasn't seeing it.
**Saulrwilson**: I wonder if they have daylight savings too.
**Saulrwilson**: I don't think so, but I mean.
**Bclymer**: The calendar should adjust for it or you know, they should also know.
**Saulrwilson**: I like the other one better though.
**Saulrwilson**: Jose.
**Saulrwilson**: Hopefully he.
**Saulrwilson**: He shows up.
**Saulrwilson**: He's the one with the acumatica and AR AP experience.
**Bclymer**: I agree.
**Bclymer**: All right, well.
**Saulrwilson**: Yeah, so it's been 10 minutes.
**Saulrwilson**: Yeah.
**Saulrwilson**: Okay.
**Saulrwilson**: I'll hop back on in about 20 minutes.
**Bclymer**: Cool.
**Saulrwilson**: All right.
**Bclymer**: Sa.
