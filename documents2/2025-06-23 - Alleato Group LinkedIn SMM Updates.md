## Transcript
**Victoria**: Hey, Maria.
**Bclymer**: Hi, Annika.
**Victoria**: How are you?
**Victoria**: Good.
**Victoria**: How are you?
**Bclymer**: Oh, good.
**Bclymer**: Can you hear the music in the background or no?
**Victoria**: No, I can't.
**Bclymer**: I'm glad it's my daughter with her.
**Bclymer**: What do you call that?
**Bclymer**: With the creep?
**Bclymer**: Just playing, so you can hear.
**Victoria**: Can you hear me?
**Victoria**: Yes, I can hear you.
**Bclymer**: Awesome.
**Bclymer**: Perfect.
**Bclymer**: Okay, let's see.
**Bclymer**: Brandon has to join too.
**Victoria**: Here he is.
**Victoria**: Hi, Brandon.
**Jdawson**: Hey, how are you?
**Victoria**: Good, how are you?
**Jdawson**: Doing well, doing well.
**Victoria**: Is your dog in today?
**Victoria**: I see their bed in the back.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, he is running around chasing at home, I'm sure.
**Victoria**: Oh, good.
**Jdawson**: He's got a big backyard, so he loves to.
**Jdawson**: To go play.
**Victoria**: Oh, that's great.
**Victoria**: Okay, well, we're going to go over the July content today.
**Victoria**: You can let me know if you've had a chance to look at anything previously.
**Victoria**: Oh, this is our agenda.
**Victoria**: So look at the July content.
**Victoria**: There's the Goodwill Bloomington video that I just want to confirm is good to go for this week.
**Victoria**: And we already looked at the newsletter, so that's good.
**Victoria**: And then there's just a reminder for Maria to reach out to the Google Bart team and Andrew because I think it's been.
**Victoria**: I think we last reached out in May to try to get their approval on this testimony.
**Victoria**: So you can just do that whenever we have a chance.
**Bclymer**: I think it was Alex.
**Bclymer**: I think it was Alex, not Andrew, but I'll check.
**Victoria**: Andrew.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I know what you're talking about.
**Jdawson**: Andrew's the client.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Oh, so.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so I'll check.
**Bclymer**: I know what you're talking about.
**Bclymer**: I'm just going to go ahead and ask for a follow up.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Let me do it again.
**Victoria**: Yeah, no worries.
**Victoria**: Okay, so I'm going to open up the content calendar.
**Jdawson**: Did Jesse approve the video for Bloomington?
**Victoria**: I believe this is the new photo she sent.
**Victoria**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Victoria**: Okay, great.
**Victoria**: Okay, so for July, we're looking at Create Escapes, people behind the builds, 4th of July, a couple of different project features like with Ulta and Radial.
**Victoria**: In fact, now that I'm looking at this, they may push Radial out a little bit more so they're not right back to back.
**Victoria**: And then in terms of what we would need from you, we still need the Day in the Life footage, which I know that your team is working on, which is great.
**Victoria**: And then maybe a trade partner spotlight might be fun to do if you have someone in mind or like a company in mind that you often work with that we could showcase them and.
**Jdawson**: Then we could probably do Dean.
**Jdawson**: We use them on a lot of stuff.
**Victoria**: Dean okay.
**Victoria**: What are they?
**Jdawson**: Electrical.
**Jdawson**: No, deem.
**Jdawson**: D, E, D, E, M.
**Jdawson**: D, E, E, M.
**Jdawson**: Deem.
**Jdawson**: Electrical.
**Jdawson**: M as in Mike.
**Victoria**: Oh, Mike Dean.
**Victoria**: Gotcha.
**Victoria**: Sorry.
**Victoria**: Okay, so electrical.
**Victoria**: And then if you want, I can send it like a prompt email to get some more info on that, or you can just kind of tell me anything that you'd want to say right now.
**Jdawson**: I don't know.
**Jdawson**: I mean, send us what you.
**Jdawson**: What we're looking for or something like that.
**Victoria**: Gotcha.
**Victoria**: Okay, I'll send a prompt email and that will get.
**Victoria**: We can take our time on that one because it's later in the month.
**Victoria**: And then, Brandon, I'm hoping you can film a Q and A kind of like if you were doing an interview, but internally.
**Victoria**: So I have a bunch of questions that you could answer for yourself.
**Victoria**: And then we could get a lot of video content.
**Victoria**: Since we've kind of run out of the reels from that interview that we had before, I thought we could kind of make a new video to use content for the next couple of months.
**Victoria**: So if you have a chance, I.
**Jdawson**: Guess in the next couple weeks, get with Maria and have her, you know, organize it and set it all up.
**Victoria**: Perfect.
**Victoria**: Okay.
**Victoria**: So Maria, you and I can chat about it.
**Victoria**: And then this document has a lot of the questions that you can chat through that too.
**Victoria**: Okay, I'm going to go down to the bottom so we can look at the contents.
**Victoria**: Okay.
**Victoria**: This is the Create Escapes video.
**Victoria**: If we click in here, we can hear the sound.
**Victoria**: I know that this sometimes can be difficult.
**Victoria**: Let me try it out.
**Victoria**: Okay.
**Victoria**: Let me know if you can hear the sound.
**Victoria**: This is kind of a micro snapshot.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I mean, it's fine.
**Jdawson**: What's the.
**Jdawson**: What's the verbiage say?
**Victoria**: This is kind of saying that it's not just about construction.
**Victoria**: Showing the end to end process of Alito and design build.
**Victoria**: So we've got breaking ground in the middle of building and then final opening.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, it looks good.
**Victoria**: Okay, so this is here.
**Victoria**: We'll look at the copy first.
**Victoria**: This is kind of like the faces behind the build.
**Victoria**: So it's a couple of photos, mostly from the.
**Victoria**: Want to say this is Westfield Collective.
**Victoria**: Thank you.
**Victoria**: Westfield Collective.
**Victoria**: This is from the Westfield Collective.
**Victoria**: Groundbreaking.
**Victoria**: From our team to our partners, clients, and the customers they serve.
**Victoria**: Every milestone is a shared win.
**Victoria**: So it starts up here.
**Victoria**: This is just a great one.
**Victoria**: It kind of has the only thing in the back, so.
**Victoria**: And if you.
**Victoria**: I don't know who any of these people are.
**Victoria**: If there's anyone you don't want to feature.
**Victoria**: That's totally fine.
**Victoria**: But the idea was just to show a bunch of faces behind the project, the community to support.
**Jdawson**: I mean, you probably want to, you know, scroll up that.
**Jdawson**: Keep going that.
**Jdawson**: Probably want to get rid of that picture.
**Jdawson**: I think of her.
**Victoria**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: I would say if we have a picture of Katie, that would be better.
**Victoria**: Okay.
**Victoria**: Who is Katie?
**Bclymer**: I'll send it to Anika.
**Victoria**: Perfect.
**Victoria**: Thank you, Maria.
**Victoria**: Okay, I'll make a note.
**Victoria**: We'll add in Katie.
**Victoria**: My guess is that there's already a picture of her in there.
**Victoria**: Okay, so we'll add that in and then besides that.
**Victoria**: Does the copy look good?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I think so.
**Victoria**: Okay.
**Victoria**: This is for Independence Day, fourth of July.
**Victoria**: Pretty standard.
**Victoria**: I want to.
**Victoria**: Now I'm looking at it.
**Victoria**: I want to remove that space between the fourth and fourth.
**Victoria**: But everything else is very.
**Victoria**: Just happy toy.
**Jdawson**: What's justice for all?
**Victoria**: Why did it say justice for all?
**Victoria**: Oh.
**Victoria**: Oh, that's a hashtag.
**Victoria**: You know, like.
**Victoria**: Like liberty and justice for all.
**Victoria**: Just like a USA hashtag.
**Victoria**: If you don't like it, we can check it out.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I would get rid of that.
**Jdawson**: That sounds like it's a political justice for.
**Jdawson**: Blah, blah, blah.
**Victoria**: Ah, yes, I do see that.
**Victoria**: Okay, how about usa?
**Jdawson**: That's good.
**Jdawson**: You could say hashtag down with the British.
**Victoria**: It's funny.
**Victoria**: Okay, I think that looks good.
**Victoria**: We could do a whole thing about spilling tea if you'd like.
**Victoria**: I'm just joking.
**Victoria**: Okay, so this post is what sets design build apart.
**Victoria**: And it's a carousel, which always works pretty well.
**Victoria**: So it starts off with why more owners are choosing a single scene from start to finish.
**Victoria**: One team on contract, on mission.
**Victoria**: Design build means fewer surprises, faster timelines, and tighter coordination.
**Victoria**: We design.
**Victoria**: Yeah.
**Victoria**: We designed to your budget, not the other way around.
**Victoria**: You get pricing early and build with completion in mind from day one.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Victoria**: And then with design build construction start sooner.
**Victoria**: We overlap design and build phases to keep momentum high.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Victoria**: And then you're not the middleman.
**Victoria**: We take full accountability and bring your vision to life with clarity and speed.
**Jdawson**: I don't get that.
**Jdawson**: You're not the middleman.
**Victoria**: Between.
**Victoria**: This is how I understand it, so it could be inaccurate, but between like general contactors and your electrician people and everything towards building, you're not the one managing all of those relationships because you are instead of the client.
**Victoria**: Is that correct?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I mean, yeah.
**Jdawson**: I mean, I still.
**Jdawson**: I don't think that's clear enough.
**Victoria**: You can change it.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I would say so scroll up to 1 above it and we overlap, design and build phases to keep momentum high, you know, instead of.
**Jdawson**: I, I don't know what high momentum means.
**Jdawson**: So I would say, you know, we overlap, design and build, you know, to condensed schedules or condensed timelines, something like that.
**Victoria**: And then you're not the middleman.
**Victoria**: We could change that to like, like, like security, like full security in our hands or something like that, something more fleshed out.
**Victoria**: But do you like that idea of it being kind of about you're, you're safe in our hands, that kind of idea, or you can feature something else?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I mean, I, I'm trying to think of something else.
**Jdawson**: I, I don't like that.
**Jdawson**: And I, I don't like the picture either.
**Jdawson**: You know, the guy flying drone.
**Victoria**: Yeah.
**Victoria**: It's an easy change.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I'm not sure what, what to put on.
**Jdawson**: You know, the, the middleman thing.
**Victoria**: We could also take it out and just have it be a three slide thing.
**Victoria**: That's an option.
**Jdawson**: All right, let's do that.
**Victoria**: Okay.
**Victoria**: Okay.
**Victoria**: Does the caption look okay?
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: And I would say at that first picture there, it almost seems like it's a little hard to read the words down there.
**Victoria**: Okay, I'll add.
**Victoria**: Okay, so for this reel, it's already been approved by Maria.
**Bclymer**: You can say already posted.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: So here I approve it.
**Bclymer**: I would already post it on Instagram, so you guys can post it on LinkedIn.
**Victoria**: Okay, perfect.
**Victoria**: Would you like to look at the copy at all?
**Victoria**: This is new copy, not the same as Instagram.
**Victoria**: I can also pull the exact copy from Instagram if you prefer.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I think there's.
**Bclymer**: On the Instagram one.
**Bclymer**: There's an explanation of what they are looking.
**Bclymer**: This is from Kendall.
**Bclymer**: Let me check really quick.
**Bclymer**: Okay, this is.
**Bclymer**: I mean, I'll paste it there for.
**Victoria**: You, but yeah, I can find it as well.
**Victoria**: No worries.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, just pull it there.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, actually it's really good, the one that we have here because they're actually talking about the position in motion and everything.
**Bclymer**: So let's do that one, the one in Instagram.
**Victoria**: Okay, perfect.
**Victoria**: Yeah.
**Victoria**: Okay, that sounds great.
**Victoria**: Okay, so this is why I want to space these out.
**Victoria**: These just shouldn't be next to each other, but I'll just move it later in the month.
**Victoria**: So this is the similar, similar reel, but for radial project or for radial in the project feature.
**Victoria**: And then if you'd like me to grab the Instagram copy for this one as well, I can.
**Victoria**: And I believe.
**Victoria**: Yeah, I, I believe I used.
**Victoria**: No, no, this is yours.
**Victoria**: One of these is.
**Victoria**: I put together A little bit differently.
**Victoria**: So I think it is this one.
**Victoria**: Does this look familiar to you, Maria?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, this is also we posted on Instagram.
**Victoria**: Okay, gotcha.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, it's on Instagram already.
**Victoria**: Okay, I'll take the captions.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, it's.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Victoria**: Okay, so this is our infographic for the month.
**Victoria**: It is how to win time and money.
**Victoria**: And so I'll give you a chance to look at it a little more closely.
**Victoria**: I can read it out loud if you'd like to.
**Jdawson**: I would take out the part that says no redraws.
**Victoria**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: That'S good.
**Victoria**: Okay, so I'll take out that part and then did you have a chance to look at the copy?
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Victoria**: Okay, great.
**Victoria**: So this is a placeholder for the Day in Life video, which was via last month, which we're pushing to this month.
**Victoria**: Maria, do you know who you think might be done first with it?
**Bclymer**: So I think Jack is going to be done first.
**Bclymer**: Andrew is going to send it to me on Wednesday and then Alex said he will send it to me also this week.
**Bclymer**: So again, I keep, you know, every day I'm like, hey, guys, don't forget this video.
**Bclymer**: Don't forget.
**Bclymer**: So they know, but I'll keep them.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so once they have the first one, I'll send it right away to you.
**Victoria**: Perfect.
**Victoria**: Thank you very much.
**Victoria**: Yeah, that'll be great.
**Victoria**: So I'll be able to edit it together once I'm back in office.
**Victoria**: And then we have the Turning Point Academy dance project feature, which is one from the website that you pointed out was definitely an Alito post or Alito build.
**Victoria**: So we've got three photos and then let's caption.
**Jdawson**: That's good.
**Victoria**: Great.
**Victoria**: And then this is another one which will be Andrew.
**Victoria**: Okay.
**Victoria**: And then we've got the trade partner spotlight, which we're going to do Beam and I'll get that to you for approval.
**Victoria**: This is a motion graphic.
**Victoria**: I'm going to pull it up in canvas so you can see it moves.
**Victoria**: But there's think design builds.
**Victoria**: Just a buzzword.
**Victoria**: Here's what it actually looks like in action.
**Victoria**: Real jobs, real deadlines, real results, all delivered by one team from start to finish.
**Victoria**: Okay, I forgot.
**Victoria**: I scrolled a little bit.
**Victoria**: Here we are.
**Victoria**: So this is.
**Victoria**: There's no sound, but it's a motion graphic.
**Victoria**: So it just has the guys walking in the background.
**Jdawson**: He's good.
**Victoria**: Okay.
**Victoria**: And then so this is another one that would be great for Brandon to film a video of and there'd be someone else on the team or if we want to do it in terms of.
**Victoria**: It doesn't have to be a video.
**Victoria**: It could be a post, but a problem solved spotlight.
**Victoria**: So a unique challenge that you face during the build and then how you solved it, and then this is just some information, like why we would do it, like target audience goal.
**Victoria**: So framing you as a proactive problem solver and strategist.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: I think it'll be good to do it with the team too.
**Bclymer**: You know, like when I was.
**Bclymer**: For example, Andrew was.
**Bclymer**: When I was talking to some of the guys, they were just telling me, like, oh, the weather is one of the things, so we have to fix this and that.
**Bclymer**: So maybe Brandon should do it because he hasn't been, like, visible from the Alito.
**Bclymer**: But maybe if we can ask the team as well.
**Bclymer**: For example, I don't know if a project went wrong, what did you do?
**Bclymer**: AJ Or Andrew or even Kev or people, you know?
**Bclymer**: So maybe I'll try to, you know, ask them to join today's team because I think it'll be good to have multiples, like how Alito solve problems.
**Bclymer**: You know, like, not only the spotlight, but how do we solve problems and then in general, like, how the team is prepared for it or how do we actually do that.
**Bclymer**: So let's make it more a little.
**Bclymer**: I'll push the guys to do this.
**Victoria**: Okay, perfect.
**Victoria**: Yeah.
**Victoria**: And maybe they could even kind of do something where they film all everything at once that might help with, like, batched filming so it doesn't feel so.
**Victoria**: Like they have to film all the time.
**Victoria**: So that's perfect.
**Victoria**: So there's that one.
**Victoria**: And then the final.
**Victoria**: Yep.
**Victoria**: The final one that we can look at is the CEO quote from the ARB Reserves here.
**Jdawson**: I said that.
**Bclymer**: You said it.
**Bclymer**: I have proof.
**Bclymer**: Real proof.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, you said it.
**Jdawson**: It's good.
**Bclymer**: I think it's good.
**Bclymer**: I mean, you're just like.
**Bclymer**: You have not only one language, you're like and everything.
**Bclymer**: But yeah, you said it.
**Bclymer**: It was really nice.
**Jdawson**: I just.
**Jdawson**: If I'm reading this right now, I'm like, obviously there's more context to this.
**Jdawson**: Right?
**Jdawson**: So anybody just reading this to be like, all right, wait a minute.
**Jdawson**: You speak both languages, Engineering slash code, and, you know, real world ops.
**Jdawson**: I'm imagining this is probably when I was talking to Sam Ullman about gpc.
**Victoria**: All right, we can put more context in the caption.
**Jdawson**: Well, I mean, it's.
**Jdawson**: It's just that you.
**Bclymer**: Maybe.
**Bclymer**: I mean, we speak both languages or maybe like, we have the entire picture.
**Bclymer**: Something like that.
**Bclymer**: Maybe more general in terms of from, you know, like engineering and then that you can say.
**Bclymer**: And ops, maybe more general.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, but you're right.
**Bclymer**: I never thought of the both languages and yeah, it kind of looks weird.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I'd say let's, let's take another stab at this with.
**Jdawson**: You can probably pull some other, you know, and just because it's not, it doesn't have to be a word for word.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: But you can, you know, dress it up so it reads better.
**Jdawson**: So let's, let's see what else we can find on, on that.
**Victoria**: Okay.
**Victoria**: There are two other quotes we can look at quick that we can go through because we could feature one of these in the meantime.
**Victoria**: One is we built these buildings from the ground up inside out across the country where commercial builders who saw the chaos clients face and decided to do it better.
**Victoria**: And then the second one is we created a niche where we handle everything mhe integrators don't, from power and permits to fire suppression.
**Victoria**: So projects stay on schedule and CEOs stay happy.
**Jdawson**: I would say so projects hit their go live date because that's a term that they use in mhe.
**Victoria**: How does this one look?
**Jdawson**: That's okay.
**Victoria**: Okay, so I'll maybe replace that again.
**Jdawson**: The end of it is like where we say and we decided to do it better.
**Victoria**: I know you don't like when you always say better.
**Victoria**: We decided to do it.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: There's in a new way, you know, it's faced.
**Victoria**: Decided to do something about it.
**Jdawson**: Something I don't know off the top of my head, but okay.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: Anything else?
**Victoria**: Nope, that is it for now.
**Victoria**: This is the graphs page.
**Victoria**: So I'll get to you.
**Victoria**: I'll get the stuff to you guys that we need changes on and I'll send a follow up email.
**Bclymer**: Thank you.
**Bclymer**: And you have me always an email if you need me.
**Victoria**: Okay, thanks, Maria.
**Victoria**: Okay, bye.
**Victoria**: Thanks.
**Bclymer**: Bye.
**Bclymer**: Bye.
**Jdawson**: It.
