**Jcurtin**: Yeah, it's coming Friday.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: Now it's.
**Jcurtin**: It's not too late if we.
**Jdawson**: If you.
**Jcurtin**: Instead of sod.
**Jcurtin**: If we just get some fescues seen.
**Jdawson**: We.
**Jdawson**: We probably need sod.
**Jdawson**: I don't know.
**Jdawson**: I don't think we.
**Jdawson**: We can wait to the seat did girl.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, it'll be here next.
**Ksipe**: Definitely need to start it.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: It'll be here next Friday.
**Jdawson**: The utility boat.
**Jdawson**: The landlord, he should be back.
**Jdawson**: I. I'll call him on.
**Jdawson**: On Monday.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: Kevin stepped out his conduit.
**Jcurtin**: He's.
**Jcurtin**: He's at the.
**Jcurtin**: He's at the water boat now with the conduit.
**Jcurtin**: So.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And did United Rentals call you or jb?
**Jcurtin**: Oh, we jump into.
**Jcurtin**: We talking regarding the situation at the back Dr.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, united.
**Jcurtin**: Reynolds called me.
**Jcurtin**: He said that he couldn't get to his office.
**Jcurtin**: He said that he'd follow up with me this morning on an ETA on the equipment.
**Jcurtin**: So that's where we're at.
**Jdawson**: JB say anything?
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, JB called me.
**Jcurtin**: He said that.
**Jcurtin**: That, that I didn't.
**Jcurtin**: He said that that guy Troy, who is his third party guy who did the original demo back there that he wouldn't be available till Wednesday.
**Jcurtin**: I guess JB had a play.
**Jcurtin**: Had already a previous plan for Monday and Tuesday for that Troy guy.
**Jdawson**: Do you have the United Rentals guys number?
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Well, we'll have to contact him right away and if not, we'll have to get the skids here from that other guy in Bloomington.
**Jcurtin**: How quick is the turnaround for to get all the credit app and the insurance and.
**Jdawson**: Does that have to go through Brandon Credit apps or are we just able to do that?
**Ksipe**: Jesse, you send it to accounting.
**Ksipe**: Hey, please fill us out.
**Ksipe**: But like are you trying to get this thing there by Monday?
**Jcurtin**: That's what we're trying for.
**Jdawson**: But yeah, we have to do Monday because McRae scheduled for Tuesday and we can't reschedule them again.
**Ksipe**: They said what?
**Jdawson**: McCrae is scheduled for Tuesday and we can't reschedule them again.
**Jdawson**: Otherwise they'll wait another week to come.
**Ksipe**: No, but aren't they just gonna do it?
**Jdawson**: No, McCrae wants nine $500 to do that little piece of concrete because I think they were upset that we didn't choose them.
**Jdawson**: We chose Integrity to demo the loading dock so they're I think that's the reason why they're asking 9, $500.
**Jcurtin**: It is.
**Jcurtin**: He keeps saying over and over, I gave Nick a price and y' all wanted to go with the lowest bidder.
**Ksipe**: You simply say, you don't have to make funny noises.
**Jdawson**: But.
**Ksipe**: We, we had the entire.
**Ksipe**: They didn't bid all of the demo.
**Ksipe**: Correct.
**Ksipe**: They took out Windows or did they bid everything for the demo?
**Jdawson**: So he.
**Jdawson**: He gave us different prices.
**Jdawson**: He gave us a price for the loading dock, which was double what Integrity's price was, and then he gave us a price for the site demo, which we did approve their price for the site demo.
**Ksipe**: So I mean, unless you can secure it with a credit card and get it out there.
**Ksipe**: But I'm just saying if they have to show up and do it, then they just going to do it when they show up.
**Ksipe**: Are they expecting to do it?
**Jdawson**: They're.
**Jdawson**: They're not going to do it.
**Jdawson**: They're probably not even going to show up unless we pay them the 9500.
**Ksipe**: Or write them a change order.
**Jdawson**: Write them a change order for 9,500 to do that little piece of concrete.
**Ksipe**: Well, what are our options, Nick?
**Ksipe**: Can we delay the schedule?
**Jdawson**: No, we can get the equipment out here and do it on.
**Jdawson**: On Monday.
**Jdawson**: Unless you don't want to do that.
**Jdawson**: That would save us like.
**Jdawson**: Like 7 or $8,000.
**Ksipe**: Well, then do it.
**Ksipe**: But I'm just saying if you can't get the equipment out there, well, we.
**Jdawson**: We can there.
**Jdawson**: There's a guy in Bloomington that has.
**Jcurtin**: Equipment at McAllister's, but he said since we're using equipment for demo, we just got to get.
**Jcurtin**: They're requiring account set up, a certificate of insurance on file to cover replacement cost of 125,000.
**Jcurtin**: Since we're usually.
**Ksipe**: You'll never get that done by Monday.
**Jdawson**: Okay, we'll just pay McCray.
**Ksipe**: Yeah, I will just be done with it.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: I'll send them a change order.
**Jcurtin**: He.
**Jcurtin**: All I gotta say is Rick better be lickety clean to finish this thing out because if he messes up at all, I will find a way to get that 9, 500 back with first for screw ups.
**Jcurtin**: Like he didn't.
**Jcurtin**: He didn't come out.
**Jcurtin**: I already know one thing he didn't come out here for.
**Jcurtin**: And I just had to keep moving forward.
**Jcurtin**: On his contract line item 40.
**Jcurtin**: It's either 40 or 41.
**Jcurtin**: He was supposed to pour back.
**Jcurtin**: He was supposed to pour back concrete at that egress opening on the south side of the Staples floor.
**Jcurtin**: And I just had the basins do it, so I don't know how much that was for him to do.
**Jcurtin**: I mean, I know it's not like ginormous, but that's just one thing in mind right there.
**Ksipe**: You know what I would focus on?
**Ksipe**: This is a lost cause.
**Ksipe**: And you're like, being vindictive and trying to do all that.
**Ksipe**: You're wasting your time.
**Ksipe**: I would make sure you dial in on every other thing that's got to happen there and just keep this from happening again.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, I would just.
**Ksipe**: It's over with.
**Ksipe**: Like, we can, like.
**Ksipe**: And I.
**Ksipe**: Again, we got such big work coming up.
**Ksipe**: I'm not gonna spend any more of my time on this.
**Ksipe**: So we just need to move on.
**Ksipe**: And don't let it happen in the future, because if it happens again in the future, then we got a problem.
**Jcurtin**: Amen.
**Ksipe**: Mistakes can be made.
**Ksipe**: I hate hearing excuses for why this happened or that to say it happened, we screwed up and we're moving on.
**Ksipe**: I love that.
**Ksipe**: Okay, so can we do that, please?
**Ksipe**: Go through all the other issues you got.
**Ksipe**: Concentrate on them.
**Ksipe**: So there's nothing.
**Ksipe**: Something else out there.
**Ksipe**: Make sure our windows are framed in perfectly and exactly for the glass that's coming in.
**Ksipe**: And the floor polishing guys are getting done and all the electrical outlets are in that need to be done.
**Ksipe**: And those are the things that will get us out of this job.
**Ksipe**: And we won't even notice that.
**Ksipe**: 90 $500.
**Ksipe**: If we let that consume all our time and all of our focus and energy, then we're going to miss something else and we're going to be in the same position again.
**Jcurtin**: No, yeah, I agree.
**Jcurtin**: I.
**Ksipe**: Okay, so then we're done talking about it.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: My last message to you last night.
**Ksipe**: Was just like, I. Jack, I don't want to hear anything more about it.
**Ksipe**: I mean, I don't know how else to be more clear.
**Ksipe**: Let's move on.
**Ksipe**: What's next on the list, Nick?
**Jdawson**: The canopy.
**Jdawson**: What.
**Jdawson**: What do you have going on there, Jack?
**Jdawson**: I know there.
**Jdawson**: There was something we.
**Jdawson**: About the roofer getting the EFIs out between the steel structure and the building.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Is that something he.
**Jdawson**: He's still trying to figure out.
**Ksipe**: I mean, your opportunity to get that done was before the roofer stuck his membrane onto the new roof.
**Ksipe**: He could have just slid something down behind it, knocked it out of there.
**Ksipe**: It's there now.
**Ksipe**: The only danger is if it does move and it crushes that ethis, it may cause it to deform and.
**Ksipe**: And screw up around outside of you know, the, the EFIs.
**Ksipe**: Because now you're crushing something that is going to move stuff around it.
**Ksipe**: So if we can't get it out of there, that's just not possible.
**Ksipe**: Worst case, it's going to crush that styrofoam at some point.
**Ksipe**: And, and, but just need to frame everything new to leave that 2 inch gap.
**Ksipe**: If you.
**Ksipe**: Are you able to get the preformed expansion joint material, Nick, that it called out for.
**Jdawson**: They were planning on using what do you, what do you call it?
**Jdawson**: Backer rod.
**Jdawson**: A two inch backer rod.
**Ksipe**: That's fine.
**Ksipe**: So just make sure everything we frame from here on and when it finishes out the sheathing and the framing and the EFIs, there's a 2 inch gap there that they can put a backer rod in and seal it and we'll be fine.
**Jdawson**: And for the.
**Jdawson**: What do you, what do you think for the parapet?
**Jdawson**: Jesse?
**Jdawson**: I guess Jack was saying you were wanting it framed an inch away from the wall.
**Jdawson**: I was just wondering how, how we could finish that if we're gonna do 2 inch.
**Jcurtin**: But.
**Ksipe**: You got the finished EFIs that's on the building.
**Ksipe**: And then you frame a wall and you leave it two inches away from the existing ethos.
**Jdawson**: And.
**Ksipe**: And then when they put the styrofoam on the front, they keep it flush with the framing.
**Ksipe**: They back wrap it and they put all.
**Ksipe**: They finish the ES there.
**Ksipe**: Now you're left with a 2 inch gap between the new ES and the existing ES.
**Ksipe**: And they put a backer rod in there and they caulk it.
**Jdawson**: Okay, caulking.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Ksipe**: Now at the top is a roof.
**Ksipe**: We're going to put a piece of flashing in.
**Ksipe**: How are we flashing in between the existing EFIs and the new parapet walls and the new roof that runs along the back wall.
**Ksipe**: Did you get details from the roofer how his system works?
**Ksipe**: They've got a million details in their catalog for how to terminate their roofing.
**Jdawson**: I asked them for a detail.
**Jdawson**: I've not got a detail yet.
**Ksipe**: Okay, just ask him what kind of roof he's using.
**Ksipe**: Go online though.
**Ksipe**: That shit probably readily available so we can come up with some good.
**Ksipe**: Like these are the things we should be concentrating on, not trying to demo out concrete because these are the things that are going to keep on causing us problems if we don't get it worked out now and get a solution and move on.
**Jcurtin**: That membrane is not tied into the deck up underneath at the bottom.
**Jcurtin**: So they left it loose so that we could figure out the whole Situation of getting that EFIs out inside that gap.
**Jcurtin**: So the only thing that quality Roofing said to me was, how about I cut a piece underneath the canopy so that I could slide that piece down?
**Jcurtin**: And I was like, no, I. I can't have you cutting any more es up underneath the canopy.
**Jdawson**: Is that the only option that he could think of?
**Jcurtin**: That's what he thought.
**Jdawson**: If that's the only option, should we just do it?
**Jdawson**: Jesse.
**Ksipe**: What'S that?
**Jdawson**: Putting the epis underneath the canopy and then we'll have to bring.
**Jdawson**: We'll bring the epis guy in for repairs.
**Jcurtin**: But is it.
**Jcurtin**: Is it.
**Jcurtin**: Is it almost just as simple as, like getting up there with a crowbar and fishing that stuff out of there?
**Ksipe**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: Is it re.
**Jcurtin**: That's.
**Jdawson**: I have to get it out.
**Jcurtin**: That's it.
**Jcurtin**: Right?
**Ksipe**: I'm saying you.
**Ksipe**: They're framing at least three and five, eight down from the ceiling down.
**Jcurtin**: So.
**Ksipe**: As long as you don't damage anything three and a half inches down, then it shouldn't be a problem.
**Ksipe**: But you got to have something left there for them to caulk to.
**Ksipe**: Also.
**Ksipe**: There's going to be a 2 inch expansion joint and you can't just get rid of all that existing ethus.
**Ksipe**: There'll be nothing to caulk to in that joint.
**Ksipe**: That's what I'm saying at this point.
**Ksipe**: I'll just leave that foam in there.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Ksipe**: You're going to do more damage trying to get it out.
**Jdawson**: Okay, well, we'll just leave it there.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: Griffin is ES contractor has told us that we can just use his boom lift.
**Jcurtin**: He just asked that we put gas in it once we're done.
**Jcurtin**: So Griffin is getting up and starting the parapet walls today.
**Jcurtin**: His light gauge framing material for underneath the canopy for the ceiling won't come in till back in them next week.
**Jcurtin**: But this was another thing, Rick, an excuse for asphalt.
**Jcurtin**: He said he didn't have anybody next week.
**Jcurtin**: I said, look, I will start framing that canopy.
**Jcurtin**: That's what was going to take place throughout next week.
**Jcurtin**: So that gives you one more week to figure this out with the asphalt guy.
**Jcurtin**: So next Monday you need to have somebody ready for asphalt.
**Jcurtin**: I don't want to hear anymore that the previous guy was supposed to do it at the end of May and like, that's enough.
**Jcurtin**: Find somebody next Monday.
**Jcurtin**: That's that.
**Jcurtin**: He said, okay.
**Jdawson**: Not sure what he said.
**Jdawson**: Do you have anything else, Jack?
**Jcurtin**: If yesterday evening we talked about the stuff with Rock Solid and him and that whole situation.
**Jcurtin**: So guess David will be in touch with you regarding all of that, with that corner piece.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I was, I was looking.
**Jdawson**: So he would, he was saying that there was a, a joint that we could have left this flush.
**Jdawson**: But looking at the Google Earth photos, I, I do not see that.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: This, it went.
**Jdawson**: We went past this, I guess.
**Jcurtin**: Is that a control joint right there?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah, I think so.
**Jcurtin**: So there, there's one right there.
**Jcurtin**: And then I think there's one above that awning right there.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, but that's.
**Jdawson**: You can see where.
**Jcurtin**: That's way too far inside the building to where.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, there's no way we, we could have left that.
**Jdawson**: So this.
**Jdawson**: I don't think there's anything we, we could have done about this.
**Jdawson**: This.
**Jdawson**: I don't.
**Jdawson**: I guess if he wants to get paid, we'll just have to.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, that.
**Jcurtin**: The, the one on the left.
**Jcurtin**: Everything's fine over there.
**Jcurtin**: He can, he can retie into that wall.
**Jdawson**: Oh, right, right here.
**Jdawson**: He said he can.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, right there.
**Jcurtin**: He said he's fine.
**Jdawson**: Oh, this was, this was the only issue he had.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, just that.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, the one on the left is fine.
**Jcurtin**: He.
**Jcurtin**: He used, he used the one on the left as an example for.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: What his expectation was on the right.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I don't think I'll show him this picture.
**Jdawson**: I don't think there's anything.
**Jdawson**: I don't, I don't see.
**Jdawson**: There's no way we could have left it at the joint because the joint looks to be right here.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: And that's what I kept.
**Jcurtin**: Like it didn't make sense.
**Jcurtin**: He said, oh, you could have just left.
**Jcurtin**: I'm thinking, well, if we have, what are we doing?
**Jcurtin**: He was talking to us.
**Jcurtin**: But yeah, with, with that coming around the corner like that, I don't think we had enough clearance to leave that.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah, I'll talk to him about that.
**Jdawson**: Is there anything else here you have going on today?
**Jcurtin**: Well, I just need.
**Jcurtin**: Let me pull up the drawing.
**Jcurtin**: There's.
**Jcurtin**: Me and him were looking over the detail and the plans yesterday to make sure that.
**Jcurtin**: Because what I don't want to happen is the top of Rick's footing be way deeper than the expectation.
**Jcurtin**: And then all of a sudden, rock solid goes, oh, I need more block.
**Jcurtin**: You know, I didn't expect to have to go that deep.
**Jdawson**: The drawings say what the top of footing should be right here.
**Jcurtin**: It's five foot six.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: But with a, with a full course of block, like 5 foot 6 would cause him having to make a, like a 2 inch cut of a block.
**Jcurtin**: But if we Wanted to go a full course all the way from bottom to top, it would be 5 foot 4.
**Jcurtin**: So I don't know if I gotta, if I gotta get like a documented approval from y' all that that's going to be okay.
**Jcurtin**: But that's, that's something that rock Solid pointed out to me was that, I mean as long if we don't want like a, a 2 inch block like cut with like other 7 courses a block, then he said, then we can leave it at 5 foot 4.
**Jdawson**: Let's just leave it as is right now since.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, let's.
**Jdawson**: Let's just leave it as is.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: All right, I'll tell him.
**Jcurtin**: Plan for 5 foot 6 and leave it as is.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: Now the only other thing I got going on today is inline painting.
**Jcurtin**: They're a third party subcontractor is going to meet me out on the site and me and him are just gonna go over things, get our conversation documented and I'm just going to tighten up things with him.
**Jdawson**: And.
**Jcurtin**: Another thing in the drawings on.
**Jdawson**: Page.
**Jcurtin**: On page A131.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: It shows for CR like so in the receiving area.
**Jcurtin**: The CR note and the WB1 note for chair rail it tells me painted PT1.
**Jcurtin**: Okay, well for then WB1 it says paint to match the wall glue and the countersink fasteners.
**Jcurtin**: Okay, well Then for note F06, provide the 4 by 4 angle iron painted safety yellow in this area.
**Jcurtin**: So in the areas that we have chair rail, baseboard and angle iron down on the bottom tells me all three of those what to paint them.
**Jcurtin**: But it doesn't tell me the expectation of the plywood what to paint there.
**Jcurtin**: And what inline is going to talk with me about again today is that they have quoted a primer to paint the drywall from 8ft to the, to the roof decking.
**Jcurtin**: But they don't have the primer to paint the plywood because they said it's a different primer.
**Jcurtin**: It's an oil based primer.
**Jcurtin**: But I needed to know expectations on if even goodwill wants this, this plywood painted.
**Jcurtin**: Like if, if they do inline is going to ask us for an upcharge for a certain amount, a certain type of primer for the wood.
**Jcurtin**: That makes sense.
**Jdawson**: That's the first time they've said I've heard anything about that.
**Jdawson**: The I know on this wall.
**Jcurtin**: Let me go back to team so I can see.
**Jcurtin**: All right, what's that?
**Jdawson**: I'll deal with that with them.
**Jdawson**: I don't know why they're asking for a change order.
**Jcurtin**: And then yeah.
**Jcurtin**: Because when I, when I go.
**Jcurtin**: So then I went and looked at their contract.
**Jdawson**: And.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Their contract says to paint all the walls.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: And it specifically says plywood does it.
**Jcurtin**: If I remember correctly, last time I looked.
**Jcurtin**: All right, let's go.
**Jcurtin**: Surfaces and trim.
**Jcurtin**: It's painting all interior exterior hollow metal doors and frames, window frames.
**Jcurtin**: Includes painting of roof access ladder.
**Jcurtin**: That's another thing.
**Jcurtin**: Includes painting wood base and chair rail.
**Jcurtin**: And here we go, right here.
**Jcurtin**: Line item 27 includes painting drywall, plywood and CMU walls.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I don't know.
**Jdawson**: Do they know it's.
**Jdawson**: It's in their contract?
**Jcurtin**: I will.
**Jcurtin**: I think there's a.
**Jcurtin**: From when I'll talk with the third party guy again today.
**Jcurtin**: There may be a disconnect between inline and their third party guy.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: If their third party guy is asking for a change order, that's.
**Jdawson**: It doesn't have anything to do with us.
**Jdawson**: We.
**Jdawson**: We just deal with.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: I think he, he's going in line and saying, hey, I need an oil based primer for this wood.
**Jcurtin**: And then Steve's coming to me and going, hey, you know this, it's a different primer and he's trying to put it off on me.
**Jcurtin**: So I'll push back with him today and say, hey, reminder line item 27 includes painting the drywall plywood team you wall.
**Jcurtin**: So you should have planned accordingly.
**Jcurtin**: And it's not, it's not my problem.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: But the painting of the roof access ladder.
**Jcurtin**: Let me make sure there's a detail of showing exactly what they want the roof access ladder to be painted.
**Jdawson**: We'll just paint it the same color that it is.
**Jdawson**: I'm pretty sure it's black.
**Jcurtin**: So that same black that we're using on the, on the window frames up front, I'll just have him do that on the roof ladder.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah, just black.
**Jdawson**: Black is fine.
**Jcurtin**: Okay, Right on.
**Jcurtin**: As of right now, there has been no change order back charge for painters and drywallers, none of that crap.
**Jcurtin**: So I've told them to not put final paint on the rooms until I say it's ready.
**Jcurtin**: I gotta get the flooring guys out of there and I'm gonna at least final paint them before Glenmark puts the soap dispensers and toilet paper holders and all that stuff in the mirrors and then they can just come back and touch up.
**Jcurtin**: And then soon I'm gonna use our contractors touch up out on the sales floor and then we'll get one more after Goodwill installs their pegboards and stuff like that.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, but.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, That's.
**Jcurtin**: So make sure if I have anything else to run by you.
**Jcurtin**: Look at the notes.
**Jcurtin**: No, we're good to go.
**Jcurtin**: Where the flooring guys are right now, they're in the.
**Jcurtin**: The two offices in a break room.
**Jcurtin**: Then they're like doing like a.
**Jcurtin**: An like half of an area of the receiving area.
**Jcurtin**: They'll have that 100% polished by next Wednesday.
**Jcurtin**: Now since.
**Jcurtin**: Since this window work is happening up high and we're not taking out any of the previous block, I'm going to have a conversation with inline again and get them back on track of.
**Jcurtin**: Hey, let's come up with a plan with painting the block.
**Jcurtin**: I know I told y' all to hate hold off on painting any block and plywood in the receiving area because we weren't sure where these windows were gonna go.
**Jcurtin**: I'm gonna have a conversation with him now.
**Jcurtin**: Reiterating.
**Jcurtin**: Let's get back on track and let's get all this anger iron painted.
**Jcurtin**: Let's.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, let's.
**Jcurtin**: Let's get it all 100%.
**Jcurtin**: So I'll be in touch with you about that and about the whole.
**Jcurtin**: Them trying to say they need an extra charge for an oil based primer for the plywood, but in their contract it says includes painting of plywood.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that was just their subcontractor, it sounds like so.
**Jcurtin**: Yes, exactly.
**Jcurtin**: And Steve's just trying to pass.
**Jcurtin**: Pass on over to our desk so make sure that doesn't happen.
**Jcurtin**: Well, right on.
**Jcurtin**: Anything else you can think run by with me or.
