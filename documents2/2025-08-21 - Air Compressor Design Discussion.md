## Transcript
**Joseph.burdzy**: Sam.
**Jdawson**: Hey, Joe, do you have everyone from your end that.
**Jdawson**: That needs to be on?
**Jremillard**: No, everybody from Exotech's on.
**Jdawson**: Okay, I guess we can get started.
**Jdawson**: I don't know if Jesse is going to join us later, but.
**Jdawson**: Brian, what was that?
**Jremillard**: Oh, that's all right.
**Jremillard**: I'll let you go.
**Joseph.burdzy**: kmass, go ahead.
**Jdawson**: Okay, Brian, I don't know if you got a chance to take a look at the specifications.
**Mparsons**: I think I took a quick glance at those yesterday.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: Let me pull this up now.
**Mparsons**: So from our end, I've got gregory Harris on the call as well.
**Mparsons**: He's our plumbing technical lead.
**Mparsons**: And we've done quite a bit of compressed air design work on other projects, including projects for ASRs Systems.
**Mparsons**: So he's our expert go to.
**Cody.page**: For.
**Mparsons**: For compressed air.
**Mparsons**: gregory, did you.
**Mparsons**: Did you get a chance to review these specs too?
**Bryan.wagar**: No, actually I did not, Brian.
**Bryan.wagar**: I apologize for that.
**Mparsons**: So I guess, Joe, would you be able to go through just a brief summary of what the ask of hendersonengineers is so we can understand?
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: Leon, can you open srs?
**Jremillard**: Basically what's happening is we've asked alleatogroup if they are willing to take the scope of the air compressor that needs to be installed.
**Jremillard**: In that scope, we need to.
**Jremillard**: Or they would need to design it, procure the equipment, and hire somebody to install it all.
**Jremillard**: Now that we've come to an agreement on what equipment is going to be used here for this project, we know exactly how much air each piece of equipment is going to need.
**Jremillard**: And we're kind of.
**Jremillard**: I guess the ask right now is for hendersonengineers to provide a quote to alleatogroup on, I guess, how much it would be in order to design, to engineer this.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: And I'm assuming in terms of what we would be responsible for, it would be sizing and specifying the air compressors themselves or the compressed air skid and then sizing, routing and design on the compressed air piping to all of the drops required by exotec.
**Mparsons**: Correct?
**Jremillard**: Correct.
**Jremillard**: Correct.
**Jremillard**: And probably designing, I don't know what you would call it, the Tran.
**Joseph.burdzy**: The.
**Jremillard**: I know where the air comes down.
**Jremillard**: And then, you know what would normally be like an electrical box, just an air box that separates it because we're obviously not going to provide a drop to every piece of machinery because there are, as you see here, about 24 pieces of machinery.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: Does exotec have, I guess, a header or a single point connection that we would be tying into and then you're branching off from there to all of these individual pieces of equipment or do we need does.
**Mparsons**: Is hendersonengineers going to be designing some type of header?
**Jremillard**: Yeah, the header needs to be designed as well.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: gregory, I'm gonna kick it over to you so you could ask some more detailed questions.
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay, well, is there a preferred compressor manufacturer?
**Jremillard**: But there, there is not.
**Jremillard**: Basically what we're looking for at this facility is we're not looking for anything that can be expanded.
**Jremillard**: We're looking for the smallest unit in terms of space that it takes up or area in the footprint.
**Jremillard**: And then we also want it to be able to fail over.
**Jremillard**: So whether or not that's one unit that has, you know, the failover ability in itself, or purchasing two units that they then can, you know, either switch every couple of weeks so that one doesn't get worn out, but they all.
**Jremillard**: They will always have that capability of one of them fails, the other one will kick on.
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay, and in that type of design, would you be.
**Bryan.wagar**: Well, I know you said space is a, is a, is a premium, so.
**Bryan.wagar**: But would you want more of an N1 type of design where you have the redundancy and then you have a.
**Bryan.wagar**: Another one just in case, or would you just want to stick with fully redundant single system?
**Bryan.wagar**: Fully redundant.
**Jremillard**: I. I mean, Leon, what do you.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Think.
**Lyon.muswere**: When you say one system fully redundant, is that like two compressors in.
**Bryan.wagar**: One minute instead of correct?
**Bryan.wagar**: Yes.
**Lyon.muswere**: I think as long as satisfies the requirement of being able to load balance.
**Lyon.muswere**: Let's say one machine runs for three days and then you switch over to the next one just so you can have the same number of machine hours over the next period of time as well as that failover.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, okay, I understand, but I think.
**Lyon.muswere**: It makes sense since space is limited just to have like one unit.
**Lyon.muswere**: But if you can find two units, we're not opposite to that as well.
**Lyon.muswere**: Whichever one works with the budgets and the functionality.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Okay.
**Bryan.wagar**: This may be in the specifications, but do we have a pressure requirements like what pressure we're designing to for the system?
**Lyon.muswere**: Yes.
**Lyon.muswere**: So that's what bclymer has on the right hand side.
**Bryan.wagar**: Oh, okay.
**Bryan.wagar**: I apologize.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yep, right there, I see it.
**Jdawson**: I'll share this with you along with the specifications that they have after the meeting.
**Jdawson**: I'll send them over.
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay.
**Bryan.wagar**: As far as the piping, is there any need for redundancy in the, in the actual compressed air piping in case.
**Bryan.wagar**: In case something, you know, needs to be taken out of service or repaired?
**Bryan.wagar**: Then you have another, you know, line of piping that could continue to keep the system running?
**Lyon.muswere**: Yes, there should be some kind of piping Isolation, whether it's for maintenance, without shutting down, jdawson off.
**Lyon.muswere**: Yes.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Okay.
**Bryan.wagar**: What about the.
**Bryan.wagar**: And this may be also in the specifications, but the dryness of the air that's required.
**Bryan.wagar**: Are there any, you know, what level of dryness?
**Bryan.wagar**: Because that's going to make a difference on what, you know, the system and pricing.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Yeah.
**Lyon.muswere**: So one column that's missing from this screenshot is actually the class or the purity flow for the app.
**Lyon.muswere**: Let me see if I can keep it.
**Lyon.muswere**: Do you have the specification actually open?
**Lyon.muswere**: It's at the very top.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Yeah.
**Lyon.muswere**: Should be page six.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Yeah.
**Lyon.muswere**: So you can see the very last column.
**Lyon.muswere**: It has the class ISO.
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay, great, Great.
**Bryan.wagar**: I think that's all the questions I had right now.
**Bryan.wagar**: Brian, is there anything you can think of that I'm forgetting?
**Mparsons**: Do we.
**Mparsons**: In terms of how we should design the headers or how many drops we need to.
**Mparsons**: Headers, do we have enough information or is there information available to indicate where all the equipment on the left is located.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Or.
**Mparsons**: Excuse me, all the equipment on the right is located?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that's what we need from exotech.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: Can we open a layout and show them the equipment?
**Jremillard**: Next week, you will have a layout with.
**Jremillard**: With all these psi, the pressure that's needed, and where.
**Jremillard**: But right now, we can.
**Jremillard**: We can show you the layout and where these.
**Jremillard**: Where everything is located.
**Jremillard**: I don't know if two drops would be enough or we would need three, but.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Yeah.
**Lyon.muswere**: So Cody is sharing his screen.
**Lyon.muswere**: He'll show you where some of the equipment will be.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, so we have some at the bottom.
**Bclymer**: So we have these four carton records down here.
**Bclymer**: They're going to need the compressed air.
**Bclymer**: We also have these six sealers right over here.
**Bclymer**: So the three on one side and three on the other side, they are also going to need the equipment.
**Bclymer**: Leon, correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe these labeling lines, there's four of them total.
**Bclymer**: These will also need compressed air.
**Bclymer**: And then.
**Bclymer**: Am I missing anything, Leon, or.
**Lyon.muswere**: Yeah, I mean, that's as far as it'll go.
**Lyon.muswere**: So you have the tracking label, you have that one, shipping counterrectors, counterformers.
**Lyon.muswere**: And then you have a line going to the maintenance gauge, each maintenance area.
**Mparsons**: All right, so if I'm looking at bullets, the list that you guys provided, that's in the.
**Mparsons**: In the specs, we got Skypod A maintenance, Skypod B maintenance.
**Mparsons**: So that's one drop, one compressed air drop or connection needed at each of those maintenance areas.
**Mparsons**: Is there a specific location in that maintenance area that does need to be?
**Lyon.muswere**: We can Provide that in the drawing.
**Lyon.muswere**: That would be something next week.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: And then you said the carton erectors were the four in the middle there.
**Mparsons**: Yes, I'm showing five carton erectors on the.
**Lyon.muswere**: Okay, I set it up to their one yet.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: And then six carton sealers.
**Mparsons**: That was the three on each side.
**Jremillard**: There's only.
**Jremillard**: There's only four carton erectors.
**Lyon.muswere**: Yes, there's only four.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Okay.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: So one of those carton erectors will be removed and then the carton sealers where this was the three on each side?
**Joseph.burdzy**: Yes.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: I've got four shipping labelers and seven tracking labelers.
**Mparsons**: That's the.
**Mparsons**: Is that eight and eight on each side there?
**Mparsons**: Yeah.
**Lyon.muswere**: So the eight and eight.
**Lyon.muswere**: Those are actually.
**Lyon.muswere**: Let's see.
**Lyon.muswere**: So the ones that Cody is highlighting, those are actually the shipping labelers.
**Lyon.muswere**: The tracking labels will be singulated.
**Lyon.muswere**: They're not part of the solution.
**Lyon.muswere**: They're just on Skypath.
**Lyon.muswere**: So you have a tracking label in front of each carbon erector, which that can be combined into one line.
**Lyon.muswere**: Just going to that machine.
**Lyon.muswere**: You have tracking label at the manual injector.
**Lyon.muswere**: Since we removed one cutting rectangle, I think we can actually remove one tracking label as well.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Yeah.
**Lyon.muswere**: We will have a document with a separate layer for all these drop points and the name corresponding to what we have in the document.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: Seems pretty straightforward.
**Mparsons**: Excuse me.
**Mparsons**: Pretty straightforward.
**Mparsons**: Yeah.
**Mparsons**: I think we'll just have.
**Mparsons**: I think the biggest thing for us will be working through where those head.
**Mparsons**: What size those headers are and where they're located to serve all that equipment.
**Bryan.wagar**: Is there a preference for the type of compressed air piping to be used?
**Lyon.muswere**: We are really not experts, so we are looking on your expertise.
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay, no problem.
**Bryan.wagar**: I just.
**Bryan.wagar**: I just like to ask that question because some people prefer copper versus blue aluminum.
**Bryan.wagar**: So we'll make our best judgment on that.
**Jremillard**: Whatever is the most cost effective.
**Jremillard**: I would say at this moment also where these get placed.
**Jremillard**: I mean, just looking at the layout, I mean, everything is kind of alleatogroup.
**Jremillard**: Everything is on the south side of the sky pod.
**Jremillard**: I mean, from just the first look, are you thinking about three drops, five drops?
**Jremillard**: What would you think just from this?
**Jremillard**: Because we can run it underneath the sky path as well.
**Mparsons**: Let's see.
**Cody.page**: One, two, three.
**Bryan.wagar**: I would think at least four drops.
**Mparsons**: At least.
**Joseph.burdzy**: But.
**Mparsons**: gregory, are you thinking one for each half of the system and then one each for the maintenance areas?
**Joseph.burdzy**: That.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, that's pretty much what I was thinking.
**Joseph.burdzy**: And.
**Bryan.wagar**: But I mean, we'd have to make sure logistically that will work.
**Bryan.wagar**: With the route, with the header and getting everything where it needs to be.
**Jremillard**: That's.
**Bryan.wagar**: That's just my first thought right now, taking a quick glance.
**Mparsons**: Yeah, Joe, that was kind of my gut feel too.
**Mparsons**: I think the maintenance ones are pretty simple.
**Mparsons**: We just want to make sure that where we place that header for each of the, what I'll call halves of the skypath system that we can get the branches from that header to your equipment.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, so it would have to.
**Jremillard**: It would have to run underneath the skypath, so it'd have to follow it.
**Jremillard**: In the srs, there is a.
**Jremillard**: One of the sections does show where it gets mounted.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: I don't know if that has like specific sizes to it or not.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: Yeah, looks like.
**Mparsons**: Looks like we can use the.
**Mparsons**: The legs or the stand of the conveyors as a mounting method for the.
**Mparsons**: The piping.
**Mparsons**: Are there any restrictions on running any.
**Mparsons**: Under any of this equipment?
**Bclymer**: Under some of the conveyors are already going to be existing cable trays that have like, various types of cable.
**Bclymer**: Some just ethernet and stuff like that.
**Bclymer**: So I'm not exactly sure how much room there will be under the conveyors exactly, because we already plan on having stuff there, but otherwise I don't think there's an issue.
**Mparsons**: Okay, this.
**Mparsons**: This may be a stupid question, but do you guys have a.
**Mparsons**: A, I guess I'd say a preferred side of the conveyor that you're planning to run that Cable tray maybe we can agree on.
**Mparsons**: Cable tray takes the left leg and the cable trail.
**Mparsons**: Right.
**Bclymer**: The cable tray itself is probably going to be like directly under the conveyor in the middle of it.
**Bclymer**: So not necessarily on one of the legs, but that's also up to our electrician who's going to be wiring that stuff.
**Bclymer**: So they haven't fully decided yet.
**Bclymer**: So I don't have like a straightforward answer, but I think that's what would probably.
**Mparsons**: Okay, gregory, I'm assuming we're not looking at anything major in terms of pipe size, so.
**Bryan.wagar**: No.
**Mparsons**: If we go either left or right and leave the center.
**Mparsons**: Middle center for.
**Mparsons**: For cable tray, we should be good.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yes.
**Mparsons**: Okay, gregory, any additional questions on from your end?
**Bryan.wagar**: Nothing I can think of right now.
**Mparsons**: I think for us we'll probably look to put together a review set for alleatogroup exotech.
**Mparsons**: So we can kind of show you what our initial design is and have you guys review and provide any feedback before we officially issue that as part of a bulletin.
**Mparsons**: Does that sound like a good plan?
**Jremillard**: Yeah, that sounds good.
**Jremillard**: Again, I just.
**Jremillard**: I wanted to make this, you know, as formal as possible.
**Jremillard**: Just so we don't get.
**Jremillard**: I don't want to muddy the waters, being that we're all working on the same project for other stuff.
**Jremillard**: Just to be clear, we are looking.
**Jremillard**: Exotek is looking for a quote directly from alleatogroup on the entire scope and how much that would be.
**Jremillard**: So if you want to include us in those phone calls, we're more than happy to be on any design reviews and things like that.
**Jremillard**: But at this moment, we are just.
**Jremillard**: We are looking for a quote before you go into any detailed engineering or anything like that.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: Yeah, we'll.
**Mparsons**: We'll put that to get something put together.
**Mparsons**: So if I'm hearing this right, hendersonengineers will contract with alleatogroup, not directly with exotec.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Correct.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: Keba.
**Mparsons**: Jesse, we'll have to work together with our legal team just to make sure that we get everything sorted out to be able to go down that path, but I don't think that should be too much of an issue.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: I've also got Ken Mathewson on the call.
**Mparsons**: He's our practice manager.
**Mparsons**: Can you have any questions that I'm not bringing up or not thinking of right now?
**Jremillard**: No, not.
**Jremillard**: Not too much.
**Cody.page**: I was just kind of thinking, you know, thinking about how to, you know, I know on some projects we've done like unistrut racking to mount compressed air pipe to.
**Cody.page**: Once we get down into like a maintenance area or something like that, I don't know, we might need to look at some options there.
**Cody.page**: And then assuming all the final connections are flexible and all that, and I guess we just need to identify who's, you know, are we indicating that on the plans or are we stopping at a certain height or, you know, just a few details like that we probably want to iron out.
**Jremillard**: Cody, can we get like a picture of what it looks like at other sites?
**Bclymer**: You mean like for air compression?
**Jremillard**: Yeah, if you're saying we need an air drop in a maintenance area, can you get a picture?
**Jremillard**: Is it.
**Jremillard**: Who can we reach out to to get a picture?
**Bclymer**: I don't think we have any in the US So we'd have to reach out to our other business units.
**Jremillard**: Is there any reason why we're putting one in the maintenance area here now then?
**Lyon.muswere**: I think it was just a letting from.
**Cody.page**: From Rotterdam.
**Lyon.muswere**: I can ask a feature.
**Joseph.burdzy**: So.
**Jremillard**: Okay, so Rotterdam has it in there and that's what we're doing.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Yeah.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: Let's see if we can get a picture of what theirs look like just so we can give some direct.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Can.
**Mparsons**: Can you guys see if you can get some pictures of some of the other equipment connections too, just so we can get an idea of what that final connection looks like between the, the piping run underneath the, the conveyors and then into, you know, carton erectors, carton sealers, et cetera.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Good point.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, we can get those pictures for you, Joe.
**Gregory.harris**: Do you guys not have, I mean, don't they fabricate these off of a drawing?
**Gregory.harris**: You don't show the air connections on any kind of a equipment drawing.
**Jremillard**: Trying to think we'll reach out to the manufacturers of these, this third party equipment and see what.
**Jremillard**: So I mean, is that a detail that we need to provide is basically the handoff?
**Gregory.harris**: Well, I would think it'd be beneficial to the engineers.
**Gregory.harris**: They know like kind of where it hooks into.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Okay.
**Cody.page**: Yeah, it would be helpful to have some locations.
**Cody.page**: Just we want to make sure we don't put a drop three feet away from where you guys need it kind of a situation.
**Cody.page**: It might also help with the pricing exercise a bit too.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Oh.
**Gregory.harris**: And then I guess was the question, like, are you guys going to design the unistrut support systems for the piping and like all the details?
**Gregory.harris**: I guess we would be.
**Gregory.harris**: Unless alleatogroup doesn't care what we use to support the pipe, but just a standard plumber.
**Gregory.harris**: You know, what they were they whatever they use to when they support this size piping or do we want to get to that level of detail?
**Cody.page**: I guess to me it probably depends on, you know, how far you're going with it.
**Cody.page**: I know we've had, we've worked on projects in the past where we have a fairly large unistrut rack assembly that we've gotten a structural engineer to design for us because we're not, we're not structural engineers, obviously, so we wouldn't be able to design a full rack system like that.
**Cody.page**: But I would think it's, you know, as long as you have something and gregory, feel free to chime in here if I'm way off base, but just something to attach to, to keep the pipe from, you know, you don't want the pipe loose or, you know, dangling there.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: Well, show the.
**Jremillard**: Leon, what's it show on the, on the conveyors.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: And I think you're referring more to the maintenance area, right?
**Cody.page**: Yeah, just anywhere where, you know, if you've got, you know, if you've got.
**Cody.page**: I don't know if this is the case, but if you have a drop serving multiple pieces of equipment, you might want some kind of a assembly there to attach the pipe too.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, we'll.
**Jremillard**: We'll get you a picture of what it looks like in the maintenance area.
**Jremillard**: Honestly, I don't think it's a.
**Jremillard**: It's not going to a piece of equipment.
**Jremillard**: I think it's more just going to be used for tools.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Gotcha.
**Mparsons**: Yeah.
**Gregory.harris**: Like in the racks, like, is that going to be out by itself, you coming down a column?
**Gregory.harris**: I think what he's talking about is like, if he needs to hook to one of these conveyors and it's out in the middle of the floor, you gotta make a rack or something, or else you're gonna have just one pipe, which I don't know what size.
**Gregory.harris**: And is it copper?
**Gregory.harris**: You know what you would recommend this being made of?
**Bryan.wagar**: We'd prefer the blue aluminum, but I want to make sure, cost wise, you know, which one would be more cost effective, because blue aluminum and copper are both, you know, very, very good choices.
**Lyon.muswere**: Is this the blue aluminum right here?
**Joseph.burdzy**: Yep.
**Lyon.muswere**: Yes.
**Gregory.harris**: So I think what you're saying is we may need to build a unistract column, basically, to go up to the structure just to keep the pipe from flopping around.
**Mparsons**: Yeah, it's.
**Mparsons**: It's two instances.
**Mparsons**: We'll have, obviously, a drop from overhead that comes down somewhere near next to the conveyor to run under the conveyor, and that'll need to be supported in the maintenance area.
**Mparsons**: We've also had other projects where there's multiple workstations located in that maintenance area, and each one gets a compressed air drop.
**Mparsons**: So that's kind of what Ken was referring to was we've had structural provide a unistrut frame so we could drop a single.
**Mparsons**: A single drop from the ceiling to that unistrut and then branch out from there to each of the workstations.
**Mparsons**: Sounds like for exitec, though, that it's only going to be a single drop in each workstation or.
**Mparsons**: Excuse me, a single drop in each maintenance area.
**Mparsons**: So is there a cage or a fence that we can mount that drop to for the maintenance area that would allow us to support that?
**Joseph.burdzy**: Yes.
**Jremillard**: So it's a fenced in area right in the corner of the.
**Jremillard**: Basically of the Skypod system.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: And you're good with us mounting, I would assume, to that.
**Mparsons**: To that fence?
**Joseph.burdzy**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: As long as it's not getting in the way of any of the wiring or anything.
**Jremillard**: Which, Cody, does the wiring go all the way around through the maintenance gauge?
**Jremillard**: I don't think it.
**Jremillard**: I don't think it does.
**Bclymer**: The wiring does not know.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: And that's.
**Jremillard**: And Leon, let's try to get clarification if we do need it in the maintenance gauge.
**Jremillard**: If we don't have it in the US I'd almost fight that.
**Joseph.burdzy**: We.
**Jremillard**: It's not necessary because if the guys aren't going to use it, I don't want to put it in there just to match the European site.
**Jremillard**: Just.
**Jremillard**: Just because.
**Gregory.harris**: Is that blue line in this picture or blue looking.
**Gregory.harris**: Is that the airline?
**Joseph.burdzy**: Yeah.
**Gregory.harris**: So is our plumber going to have to run this like all throughout the racks as well?
**Lyon.muswere**: No, not racking, just the outcome there.
**Jremillard**: The conveyor.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Yes.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Yes.
**Lyon.muswere**: So I'll share this real quick.
**Lyon.muswere**: So essentially all the pneumatic devices or missions will be outbound.
**Lyon.muswere**: And this green box is what we expect the actual mission to be.
**Lyon.muswere**: And you're pretty much routing to the missions.
**Jremillard**: This, the yellow box is where we expected to be.
**Lyon.muswere**: I thought they put it right in front of it instead of here.
**Mparsons**: Yeah, it did get moved to the north side of that restroom group.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Okay.
**Lyon.muswere**: And then all machines will be on the outbound area.
**Lyon.muswere**: And this is the maintenance at the very top left and top right.
**Lyon.muswere**: So nothing is going to the node section of the racking?
**Lyon.muswere**: Nothing is going to the racking.
**Lyon.muswere**: Everything would be the south side of the racking.
**Gregory.harris**: Okay, and is it basically there's an airline under every single conveyor belt or conveyor?
**Mparsons**: Yeah.
**Lyon.muswere**: I think if that's the most practical solution, then we do accommodate that.
**Lyon.muswere**: You can put the wiring or the lining under the conveyor.
**Lyon.muswere**: I think it's just to minimize the number of traps.
**Cody.page**: That's also a cleaner install and it gives you a little bit of flexibility.
**Cody.page**: If you add anything along that conveyor in the future, eventually.
**Cody.page**: I don't know if that would happen or not, but that's probably the cleanest way to do it.
**Gregory.harris**: Do you have any photos of like the main line feeding over to.
**Lyon.muswere**: I can try to see.
**Lyon.muswere**: Just going to open some compressor pictures here.
**Lyon.muswere**: So I think the main line is this one going over.
**Lyon.muswere**: Let's see if I have more pictures close up.
**Lyon.muswere**: So that's like a brace.
**Lyon.muswere**: So this one actually doesn't go to the.
**Lyon.muswere**: To the ceiling and you don't actually have that kind of drop.
**Gregory.harris**: So.
**Lyon.muswere**: But it's because the air compressors are really close to the conveyor.
**Lyon.muswere**: This is just going over the conveyor and then.
**Lyon.muswere**: Yeah, so just one main line coming out the compressors and this is the drainage.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: So they have different regulations in Europe.
**Jremillard**: I guess they can just drain into a bucket and then they make it part of their daily routine that they have to that.
**Jremillard**: They have to empty that.
**Jremillard**: What they did here is instead of going with two big compressor or with two big compressors, they went with three compress three small compressors and two of them are always running.
**Jremillard**: And every couple of days it switches to the next one to where it's.
**Jremillard**: They basically just fail over to each other.
**Jremillard**: But one of them is always off and the one that's off switches like every week.
**Jremillard**: So.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Yes, that.
**Bryan.wagar**: That's what I was referring to as far as the N plus one, basically.
**Joseph.burdzy**: What do you mean?
**Bryan.wagar**: No, I would say the three compressor system like what you're showing there.
**Bryan.wagar**: That's.
**Bryan.wagar**: That's the same thing as what I was referring to as far as an N plus one design where you'd have the third one just in case and then.
**Bryan.wagar**: But the others they switch off, so.
**Jremillard**: Correct.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, like I said, whatever.
**Jremillard**: If it meets the footprint and it meet and it.
**Jremillard**: You know, and it's more affordable.
**Jremillard**: I mean we're, we're.
**Jremillard**: Oh again we don't.
**Jremillard**: We're not, we're not picky.
**Jremillard**: We.
**Jremillard**: This is why we go.
**Jremillard**: We're leaning on someone else for their expertise.
**Jremillard**: exotec normally does not handle this part of the scope for any of our customers.
**Jremillard**: But because Uniglo is very specific in their needs that the sales decided to take this on.
**Jremillard**: So we are kind of looking for somebody to guide us in the right direction.
**Bryan.wagar**: Understood.
**Cody.page**: So who typically handles it on projects?
**Cody.page**: The customer does.
**Cody.page**: Do they hire out an EOR to do that?
**Jremillard**: Typically I haven't.
**Jremillard**: Most, most customers, especially in existing building already usually have enough air, you know that they can just pull off of.
**Jremillard**: alleatogroup I guess does not.
**Jremillard**: So they have to have a completely new system.
**Jremillard**: Otherwise I would, I would imagine it just gets designed directly into the building when they're, when they're putting in stuff.
**Jremillard**: So this is kind of after the fact.
**Jremillard**: It's an existing building and they just.
**Jremillard**: I guess, I guess they don't have it anywhere else in the building.
**Cody.page**: Got it.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Okay.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Did they.
**Gregory.harris**: And I guess initially you guys, you designed the electrical for the compressors and the drains.
**Gregory.harris**: Surprised they didn't just have you do the piping or I guess is it because didn't really know what the layout of everything would be.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, we didn't know what the just, just like with the electrical, with the equipment.
**Jremillard**: We didn't know exactly what equipment was going to be the final drawing per se.
**Jremillard**: You know, with.
**Jremillard**: With our processes, it's more of a sales hands over a.
**Jremillard**: This will work now project team.
**Jremillard**: You Figured out the details and you know, as you can see as we went through this, you know, this box situation that just kind of got not overlooked but made a little sound a little easier than it was situation really caused a lot of problems and we had to, we did have to change quite a few things that normally do not get changed this much in a, in a project like this.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: Quick question too.
**Jremillard**: Just, just off topic and off the record.
**Jremillard**: What is alleatogroup affiliation with jremillard?
**Jdawson**: Good question.
**Jdawson**: I was going to ask that to see if.
**Mparsons**: From, from hendersonengineers site.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: Like, do you do all, like are you affiliated of them?
**Jremillard**: Do you do all of their engineering?
**Jremillard**: Like, I'm just, I'm curious the relationship here.
**Jremillard**: Maybe for future projects as well.
**Mparsons**: Yeah, no, go ahead, Ken.
**Cody.page**: I was just gonna say no.
**Jremillard**: So we have.
**Cody.page**: We are not affiliated with jremillard, but we are under contract with TPG on this project.
**Cody.page**: We, we've done a lot of work, worked with TPG historically on the retail side.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Okay.
**Cody.page**: So that's, that's kind of what led us to this project just to give you some background and then also just due to our experience working with ASRs systems.
**Joseph.burdzy**: So.
**Cody.page**: But to answer your question, no, we're not affiliated.
**Cody.page**: They.
**Cody.page**: They hired us, they brought us on board.
**Jremillard**: No, that's all.
**Jremillard**: No, that's awesome.
**Jremillard**: I'm.
**Jremillard**: I've enjoyed working with the crew you've assigned to this project.
**Jremillard**: So I was just for my own benefit and you know, things down the line, like I said, we're a fairly new automation company here in the US and projects are coming down the pipeline and we'd like to expand our, you know, our, our vendor list of, you know, experts to work with.
**Cody.page**: Yeah, absolutely.
**Cody.page**: And we're always open to other opportunities.
**Cody.page**: We're trying to build this business vertical on our end.
**Cody.page**: So absolutely anywhere we can help.
**Cody.page**: You know, we've got a lot of services under our belt that we can assist with.
**Cody.page**: And we've also like with compressed Air, we've done compressed airplane designs.
**Cody.page**: We've had situations where we've had vendors running that design and the client preferred us to have us involved to do an actual engineered design so we could go through the submit process and all that just due to the, you know, the vendor LED design being a bit inconsistent site to site.
**Cody.page**: So we've helped out in areas like that before too.
**Cody.page**: Yeah, we can, I'm sure there's plenty of ways we could help you out in the future if need be.
**Jremillard**: Absolutely appreciate it.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Yeah.
**Mparsons**: And Joe, I'll say even with the complexities that we've dealt with on this project and the hoops we've had to jump through.
**Mparsons**: It's been a pleasure working with you guys too.
**Mparsons**: We see a lot of work from EXITEC that improves and helps us on the engineering side and makes things easy for us.
**Mparsons**: So it's been fun working with you guys.
**Mparsons**: We've, we've got the hard one out of the way, hopefully and anything in the future that we go with, it's just going to be that much easier for us moving forward.
**Mparsons**: So.
**Jremillard**: No, absolutely.
**Jremillard**: I think we found our rhythm.
**Jremillard**: I think there was a lot of miscommunication, but a lot of misunderstood parts of the process, not only from the customer, but probably stems all the way back to the sales phase when we kind of set, set our goals in the beginning and what, what goes where and when.
**Jremillard**: I think due to the nature of this customer, they, they, they really like to get ahead and I think they were just, they were going too, too fast, too soon.
**Jremillard**: And you know, it's, it's a hard lessons learned on our part because this is also a new system from our side.
**Jremillard**: The Skypod 2 system has just, you know, this is only the third one that's going to be installed in the United States.
**Jremillard**: The other two are currently just a couple months ahead of this one.
**Jremillard**: So it's just, it's a lessons learned on our side as well that we'll be able to set the expectations correctly for the, for the next project as well.
**Cody.page**: Yeah, we've, we've seen a lot of this kind of thing with other vendors as well.
**Cody.page**: You guys aren't alone there.
**Cody.page**: I think once folks get a couple projects under their belt and get into a cadence, it starts getting a lot better and easier.
**Jremillard**: No, agreed, but sorry, sorry to go off track there, but do we need, is there anything else left on the air compressor that we need to talk about for this meeting?
**Jremillard**: I know we're a couple minutes over.
**Jdawson**: Yes, I do have a question.
**Jdawson**: I want to share my screen really quick.
**Jdawson**: So on here we have a requirement to put the curves around it.
**Jdawson**: Is that also part of the scope?
**Jdawson**: Yes, I know currently we don't have it on our scope for this project.
**Cody.page**: Just the, just the pad itself.
**Joseph.burdzy**: They'Re.
**Gregory.harris**: Putting in a curb.
**Gregory.harris**: So you don't drive a forklift over.
**Joseph.burdzy**: There.
**Gregory.harris**: Like a 6 by 6 angle or something like that.
**Mparsons**: Does TPG have that curve detailed on their drawings?
**Joseph.burdzy**: No.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: gregory, I think we've seen both instances.
**Mparsons**: Right.
**Mparsons**: We've seen pad mounted and just straight to correct slab on grade.
**Mparsons**: I think we may have to coordinate that with EPG and the structural AUE just to make sure if confirm that whether this, the slab that's currently on grade is enough to support that equipment or if a housekeeping pad or supportive pad underneath the air compressors is required.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So, Brian, would this eventually be going through TPG at some point?
**Mparsons**: Eventually, I guess, yes.
**Mparsons**: Technically, once, if, if we proceed with hendersonengineers doing the design, the engineering design for the compressed air system, it'll be issued in a bulletin, probably bulletin number two, which will technically have to go through jremillard.
**Mparsons**: So we'll, if a pad's needed, we'll coordinate that with coordinate to make sure that gets added to either architectural or structural drawings.
**Jremillard**: Is, are, are these pads and kind of safety.
**Jremillard**: Is this like a requirement on a site like OSHA requirement, or is this more.
**Jremillard**: Hey, the customer just wants to make sure that nobody runs into it.
**Mparsons**: gregory.
**Bryan.wagar**: I'm sorry, I accidentally.
**Bryan.wagar**: I couldn't unmute.
**Bryan.wagar**: No, I believe it's more just for safety of the equipment to make sure no one runs it over.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: So with that, I would think that's gonna, that's definitely gonna fall into the customer scope to protect their equipment.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Yeah.
**Cody.page**: And there's, there's other options there too, if a customer wants to try to save costs.
**Cody.page**: I don't know, the curbing might be the most cost effective protection, but you can do bollards and rails or, you know, just put it up on a pad just to get it up off the floor.
**Cody.page**: You know, there's other options there too.
**Gregory.harris**: If it's 6 by 6 or 4 by 4 metal angle works, that's your cheapest option to do anything there because it would, it'd be nothing really compared to the rest of the stuff.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Yeah.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: Well, we're, we're going to put up a plastic fence to start with and.
**Gregory.harris**: Then that's the most cost effective.
**Jremillard**: They can decide where they want to take it from there.
**Jremillard**: Okay, well, before we get ahead of ourselves, let's, let's figure out the footprint of these that we're going to have for these machines and then we can better communicate the size of the barrier that they may or may not want to install.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Cody.page**: Brian?
**Cody.page**: I guess is this, how are we intending to show the design?
**Cody.page**: Is it going to be on the same.
**Cody.page**: Are we going to develop another set of plans?
**Cody.page**: Is it going to remain on this set?
**Mparsons**: I would think it would need to.
**Mparsons**: I think the simplest solution would be to remain on the, on the current set of drawings.
**Mparsons**: Maybe we just probably have to add in another sheet, potentially add another sheet for.
**Mparsons**: For some details and the compressed air piping.
**Mparsons**: But I don't think it that we need to issue this as a completely separate set.
**Gregory.harris**: No, I wouldn't think so.
**Gregory.harris**: And really they just need the floor plan and like a drop detail and with the sizing on the pipe and I would think they should figure it out.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, this might be a really stupid question because I've.
**Jremillard**: I've never had to design anything that has to do with the actual air compression where it comes from.
**Jremillard**: But do you do drawings like this need to be stamped at all?
**Mparsons**: Yeah, yeah, yeah, we'll need to stamp them.
**Mparsons**: So.
**Cody.page**: Okay, that's kind of what I was asking.
**Cody.page**: Is it going to be part of the permit package the rest of the project, or does it need to be assign separate package going for permit?
**Cody.page**: I think you could do it either way.
**Cody.page**: But just to clarify.
**Jremillard**: I don't know, I'd have to defer to TPG or alleatogroup because I believe they pulled all the permits and such.
**Gregory.harris**: Yeah, Mike, you can go down and just check out if airlines or something they require permits for.
**Lyon.muswere**: We'll do follow up.
**Cody.page**: Yeah, either way we get it signed and sealed, you know, shouldn't be an issue.
**Mparsons**: Okay, well, I think we're good on Henderson's end.
**Mparsons**: So I'll work to get some proposed fees put together and get those over to you guys that you can review.
**Mparsons**: And then once we get a green light, we'll start coordinating design items.
**Mparsons**: Joe, Jesse, do you want me to send that to both of you?
**Mparsons**: Do you want me to send it just to Jesse?
**Joseph.burdzy**: How do you.
**Joseph.burdzy**: You can.
**Jremillard**: You can send that to Jesse because they.
**Jremillard**: alleatogroup has to put together a final quote pretty much for us.
**Mparsons**: Okay, yeah, I'll send that over to Jesse and Kevin as soon as I got that put together.
**Jdawson**: Okay, sounds good.
**Gregory.harris**: Thank you.
**Jdawson**: Joe, I sent you an email earlier not related to this.
**Jdawson**: If you can get back to me on that.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, I saw it.
**Jremillard**: I'm gonna.
**Jremillard**: I'll reply in just a minute here.
**Jdawson**: Okay, sounds good.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Thank you.
**Jremillard**: Appreciate it, man.
**Jremillard**: Thanks y'.
**Joseph.burdzy**: All.
**Mparsons**: Thanks everyone.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Thanks, everybody.
