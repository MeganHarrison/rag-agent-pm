## Transcript
**Tgreen**: Not bad at all.
**Skrumenacker**: Yeah.
**Tgreen**: Is it warmed up in Florida at all?
**Tgreen**: Just I need to.
**Housh**: It's just I think Yesterday felt like 106, if that helps give you a frame of reference at all.
**Tgreen**: It's good.
**Skrumenacker**: Yeah, it's.
**Tgreen**: It's not cool get here.
**Tgreen**: It's like we're just missing got hush on here.
**Tgreen**: Hey, Steve.
**Sandy**: Good morning.
**Sandy**: How are you?
**Tgreen**: Morning.
**Housh**: Good morning.
**Skrumenacker**: How you doing?
**Tgreen**: Good.
**Skrumenacker**: Good to see you too.
**Tgreen**: We had Tony Green.
**Tgreen**: Was he gonna join, do you know?
**Housh**: So I. I don't know if he.
**Housh**: I know Preeti and Yeah, yeah.
**Jremillard**: You've got Nick Mao and Pre.
**Skrumenacker**: Ingenuity.
**Jacki**: Yeah, I don't think we'll be joining.
**Jacki**: He said we will try, but I'm not sure if we will be joining.
**Jacki**: But I think we are good to start.
**Skrumenacker**: Okay.
**Tgreen**: You know, Brandon's on a plane, so he probably won't be joining, so.
**Tgreen**: So yeah, we can get started.
**Tgreen**: But glad everyone could jump on here.
**Tgreen**: Don't have a whole lot to go over today.
**Tgreen**: I wanted to mainly have everyone meet each other who's going to make up the design team.
**Tgreen**: I talked to who surely he was.
**Tgreen**: Got tied up at a city meeting or something.
**Tgreen**: So.
**Skrumenacker**: Okay.
**Tgreen**: He should be joining us as well.
**Tgreen**: So I guess we just go around the room.
**Tgreen**: Introduce me to who you are, what your role is.
**Tgreen**: And we can start here with.
**Tgreen**: Well, Justin, I'll let you go first.
**Housh**: Yeah, sure.
**Skrumenacker**: Yeah.
**Housh**: Justin Kimmick Smith Architecture here in Tampa.
**Housh**: Once we get things rolling, we'll bring in likely Dinah from our group to help kind of project manage everything.
**Housh**: And then we had brought with our team the MEP scope.
**Housh**: So I'll turn it over.
**Housh**: Ingenuity.
**Jacki**: Good morning.
**Jacki**: My name is Preeti Kumari.
**Jacki**: I will be the project manager for this project.
**Jacki**: And I also have background in electrical engineering.
**Jacki**: But we will have a dedicated electrical designer, but that will be overall, you know, managing the project.
**Jacki**: Then we have Nick.
**Jacki**: Nick.
**Skrumenacker**: Yeah.
**Housh**: Hi.
**Jremillard**: Nick Maffeo.
**Jremillard**: I'll be maybe second point of contact.
**Jremillard**: Preeti runs the show and I'll.
**Tgreen**: And Nick, I think we lost you there.
**Jremillard**: Like really said there'll be separate designers and a separate engineer.
**Jremillard**: I. I kind of consult.
**Jremillard**: I am an engineer, but I kind of consult everyone to help bring it all together, if that makes sense.
**Skrumenacker**: Good.
**Skrumenacker**: Good.
**Tgreen**: All right, we got Joe.
**Skrumenacker**: Hi.
**Jremillard**: Joe Roselle, associate principal, DCI engineers, working with Steve.
**Tgreen**: Okay.
**Skrumenacker**: Be probably main point of contact, day to day project managing of the.
**Skrumenacker**: Of the structural scope of work.
**Skrumenacker**: Okay.
**Sandy**: And I'm Steve Kirmanakker, also with DCI Engineers and We'll have another, you know, a host of other folks involved with.
**Sandy**: With Joe and I, some other engineers and BIM staff involved in the process.
**Sandy**: So.
**Tgreen**: Good deal.
**Skrumenacker**: Yeah.
**Tgreen**: And we got, you know, Justin has an interior designer.
**Tgreen**: I just gotta get an approval on that from the owner and then see if she's joining the team.
**Tgreen**: And then I don't know what's going on with Hoosh, but, you know, I've worked with Douche on two projects previously.
**Tgreen**: I worked with Justin on project previously.
**Tgreen**: Steve, I've worked with you on a project previously, so it's good to work with people that you get along with and, you know, it's been a good job.
**Tgreen**: So.
**Tgreen**: Yeah, looking forward to same thing, getting to know you guys.
**Housh**: Yeah, absolutely.
**Housh**: And the other overlap, too.
**Housh**: Been working with Hoosh from our side too, projects in the past.
**Housh**: And then we just finished up a mixed use, vertical, mixed use with ingenuity here in Tampa.
**Housh**: So went really well.
**Housh**: So we thought, hey, let's.
**Housh**: Let's do it again.
**Tgreen**: And then Jesse Remillard, so he's on here.
**Tgreen**: He's a senior PM for Alito.
**Tgreen**: He'll take the lead for, you know, coordinating all the design meetings.
**Tgreen**: And we work with Justin a little bit at Alito.
**Tgreen**: You know, we have clients like this one that they hire us, and they don't really want to be involved in the design process.
**Tgreen**: They just want to tell us what they want built, and we give them a budget for what we can build it for, and then they expect us to steer the design to meet that budget.
**Tgreen**: And so that's why, you know, we want to.
**Tgreen**: We don't like.
**Tgreen**: And Nick, I think Nick, you just joined.
**Tgreen**: I don't know.
**Tgreen**: You're with.
**Skrumenacker**: Who are you with?
**Housh**: Oh, yeah, he just turned his camera on.
**Jacki**: I think he just turned his camera.
**Jremillard**: I was a few minutes late, and I'm on my phone, so I got my desk.
**Skrumenacker**: That's all.
**Tgreen**: All right, well, who's she?
**Jremillard**: I'm also from Ingenuity, the same guy you've met.
**Tgreen**: All right.
**Skrumenacker**: I don't know if it was a new Jesse.
**Tgreen**: All right, who should introduce yourself to everybody?
**Bclymer**: Great.
**Bclymer**: Be happy to Northside, who's with Northside Engineering.
**Bclymer**: We are working with you on the civil design and development.
**Bclymer**: And I have with us right now Gene as well as Hamid on this call with us.
**Skrumenacker**: Okay, very good.
**Tgreen**: That's good.
**Tgreen**: So, yeah, like I was saying, you know, they, you know, have a design or basically a budget and what they want built, and so that's what we look to work with.
**Tgreen**: People.
**Tgreen**: And by figuring things out in the front end, we're not redrawing things.
**Tgreen**: We're not doing a bunch of ve.
**Tgreen**: And, you know, we're.
**Tgreen**: We're able to.
**Tgreen**: Which of those two Justin sent we'll use on that yet.
**Tgreen**: We'll have them involved in the beginning as well.
**Housh**: You broke up there for a minute, Jesse.
**Tgreen**: Oh, I just said the.
**Tgreen**: The waterproof consultant will bring them on.
**Housh**: Board.
**Tgreen**: Early on, too.
**Tgreen**: It's got to decide who we're going to use there.
**Skrumenacker**: So.
**Tgreen**: And you know, I got all the proposals from all of your.
**Tgreen**: For your design fees.
**Tgreen**: So we'll be getting you all either purchase order, contract, we'll get those all out, sent to you here in the near future as well.
**Tgreen**: And two, it would help me if you'd respond, you know, the.
**Tgreen**: You got my email if you can and just let me.
**Tgreen**: Who's your point of contact at each company?
**Tgreen**: Like, who's the accountant that needs to be.
**Tgreen**: You know, we use a program called Job Planner.
**Tgreen**: And so you do all your invoicing and that all goes through Job Planner.
**Tgreen**: And so we just.
**Tgreen**: You just tell us who that contact is and we'll get them set up in there so they'll get, you know, the notices and when the billing periods are open, things like that.
**Tgreen**: Also, like, we'll enter all the contacts for each company, you know, who gets submittals for which discipline or, you know, which engineering piece.
**Tgreen**: That way we can get them.
**Tgreen**: So all the submittals will be run through that program as well.
**Tgreen**: We'll be able to, you know, obviously it's like everyone else works with the drawings getting uploaded to it, things like that.
**Sandy**: Jesse, are you planning to issue like your standard contract to each of us?
**Sandy**: Is that how you.
**Tgreen**: You typically.
**Tgreen**: Yeah, we'll do it.
**Skrumenacker**: You would do it.
**Sandy**: Okay.
**Skrumenacker**: Okay.
**Skrumenacker**: Yeah.
**Tgreen**: I don't know if I broke up there.
**Tgreen**: I missed out something.
**Tgreen**: I'll turn my camera off.
**Tgreen**: Usually my video feed messes up my audio, but.
**Tgreen**: But yeah, we'll get a contract with everyone for the design services.
**Tgreen**: We'll get that set up.
**Tgreen**: Is there a day in the week that works better for anybody than others that we could.
**Housh**: Or a recurring meeting?
**Tgreen**: Yeah, recurring meeting.
**Sandy**: Not necessarily.
**Skrumenacker**: Yeah.
**Housh**: Yeah, Each is a little different.
**Housh**: I have some already on Thursday afternoon, so that.
**Housh**: That can get tight.
**Housh**: So I'd say outside of Wednesday and Thursday, I'm pretty open.
**Skrumenacker**: Depending.
**Skrumenacker**: Okay.
**Skrumenacker**: Fridays are good.
**Skrumenacker**: Okay.
**Skrumenacker**: Yeah.
**Tgreen**: Friday pretty good for me between 1 and 3.
**Bclymer**: And we do Fridays like 2 o'.
**Bclymer**: Clock.
**Tgreen**: 2 o' clock works for me.
**Tgreen**: That work for everyone else?
**Sandy**: Yeah, it's fine with me.
**Skrumenacker**: Yeah.
**Sandy**: Okay, what are you, what are you guys thinking in terms of the sort of frequency of, of those doing it every other week?
**Sandy**: Every week.
**Sandy**: I mean we probably don't need weekly at least in the near term.
**Skrumenacker**: Right.
**Sandy**: Until we can or maybe we do in the near term and then I'm not sure.
**Tgreen**: I think if we do every other week we can meet, you know, individually with some of the things as we get going because like one of the first things that we got to do for the owner is we, you know, we need who should to revise the site plan a little bit.
**Tgreen**: You know, we just want to get that layout where the building goes.
**Tgreen**: And then they would like some elevation drawings of, you know, the hotel which again, you know, they haven't selected, you know, if they're going to partner with a hotel brand at this point yet or which one they're going to choose.
**Tgreen**: So we should know more on that or if we're just gonna go with our own design for it.
**Tgreen**: We've, we proposed on the four story structure, 60 units, I believe it was 10 condos and then 50 hotel rooms.
**Tgreen**: They would like the swimming pool and a restaurant up on the roof.
**Tgreen**: And that's where, you know, level one they do want to have.
**Tgreen**: They don't really want any hotel rooms on level one.
**Tgreen**: So right off the bat is that, is that, you know, instead of them having, you know, maybe a coffee shop inside the hotel and a like a ballroom type meeting room on the first floor.
**Tgreen**: So there we early on we can look at.
**Tgreen**: Does that mean we need to go up another floor or, you know.
**Tgreen**: Yeah, we adjust that right away.
**Housh**: Yeah, I mean getting clear on that program is really going to be critical.
**Housh**: You know, what, what standard we want to use in terms of if they are going with a brand, a flag, what their standards want to be also what, what their mix would like to be.
**Housh**: A lot of times that is directed by the brand, otherwise they can help direct on that in terms of numbers of double queens versus kings versus king suites, you know, how do we, how do we program that out?
**Housh**: And then similarly kind of going up to the condos like this, the size, the types, do they want some twos, some threes or they want them all the same?
**Housh**: All of that's going to be really critical to help understand how this starts to lay out.
**Housh**: And then that will also help develop the footprint for who should work with.
**Housh**: Now he could kind of start generally with what's there now, but we'll Refine it.
**Housh**: Then once this starts to beep out a little bit.
**Housh**: And then we really need to get those floor plans locked in from the programmatic standpoint before we get the elevations done.
**Housh**: Otherwise it'll just be a goofy picture.
**Skrumenacker**: Yeah.
**Skrumenacker**: Okay.
**Tgreen**: And then Steve, I know we, you, you know, when we talked previously, you were talking about possibly like a structural stud supporting a slab.
**Skrumenacker**: Right.
**Tgreen**: And I just, I want to look at.
**Tgreen**: I have a contractor.
**Tgreen**: I love post tension building, so I'm partial to that.
**Tgreen**: And then just the simplicity of it and building, building it.
**Tgreen**: You know, if we got a pool on the roof, like those things.
**Tgreen**: So I have a budget for what I could build the structure out of a post tension.
**Tgreen**: So I just want to compare that to that.
**Tgreen**: And if it's close or the, you know, that may be the way to go.
**Tgreen**: And I don't know what your.
**Tgreen**: If you have any.
**Tgreen**: If you guys are on board with that.
**Tgreen**: I don't know if you do your own post tension structural design.
**Sandy**: We do, yeah.
**Sandy**: Yeah, we're totally fine with that.
**Sandy**: We do a lot of post tension concrete, so not a problem.
**Sandy**: And we'll just work with Justin as the, you know, to his point, as the program and the plans are kind of flushing out.
**Sandy**: We can certainly work with them on, on column layouts or wall layouts or, you know, figuring out the best way to structure it.
**Sandy**: As those plans are coming together.
**Skrumenacker**: That'S.
**Sandy**: The time to make the structure efficient, certainly as it's.
**Sandy**: As those plans are coming together.
**Tgreen**: So.
**Housh**: Yeah, absolutely.
**Skrumenacker**: Yeah.
**Housh**: I think if we're going to go that, I mean, I favor the PT slab too.
**Housh**: You get a little bit more flexibility, get the thinner floor profiles.
**Housh**: So I think getting an understanding of, I mean, I understand base size for that, but a general column.
**Housh**: Column size would be helpful as we start laying out those.
**Housh**: You start to plan around them.
**Sandy**: Yeah, we could certainly help with that.
**Skrumenacker**: Okay.
**Tgreen**: Right.
**Tgreen**: And then as far as the MEPs is it.
**Tgreen**: Does it really matter much?
**Tgreen**: It's.
**Tgreen**: If it's a hotel, it's going to be pretty standard for your design.
**Tgreen**: Is there anything that you would need.
**Jacki**: Do we have figured out for this hotel?
**Jacki**: I'm sorry, do we have any standards for this hotel?
**Tgreen**: I don't have that yet, no.
**Skrumenacker**: Yeah.
**Housh**: The brand.
**Jremillard**: The brand's going to dictate.
**Skrumenacker**: Right.
**Jremillard**: The brand's going to dig.
**Tgreen**: Right.
**Jremillard**: Whatever brand they go is very critical.
**Skrumenacker**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: For what, you know, because they're.
**Jremillard**: Do they want.
**Jremillard**: I don't know if their ownership has a preference for PACS or vertical package units.
**Jremillard**: Or split systems above the.
**Jremillard**: You know, like, the brand will dictate that some too, but then if not, we would need.
**Jremillard**: I think, to me, it's dictated solely by that.
**Tgreen**: Typically, what is, like, in the different.
**Tgreen**: I'm just thinking of cost.
**Tgreen**: Like, is one a lot different than the other, or.
**Skrumenacker**: Yeah, they're all.
**Jremillard**: They're all different cost points, really.
**Tgreen**: Right.
**Jremillard**: The PTAC is your cheapest option.
**Jremillard**: I mean, what kind of star hotel do you go.
**Jremillard**: You do.
**Jremillard**: Are you aiming for it?
**Jremillard**: Really kind of dictates that too.
**Tgreen**: Well, one of the brands they're talking to is this Hard Rock signature brand.
**Tgreen**: Isn't that what it was, Justin?
**Tgreen**: The Reverb or Reverb.
**Tgreen**: That's right.
**Skrumenacker**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: So they're.
**Jremillard**: They're gonna.
**Jremillard**: I don't have any, like, two, two and a half star ptacs.
**Jremillard**: You grow two and a half to three star, your vertical package beyond higher than that, then you go to, typically, some kind of fan coil above the ceiling, and they all change.
**Jremillard**: The cost of the systems change dramatically based on that too, of course.
**Skrumenacker**: So.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: So we really need to get that brand's involvement.
**Skrumenacker**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: To know that.
**Skrumenacker**: But.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, I mean, obviously.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: Because if you're using certain brands and you wanted to use a PTAC because it's cheaper, like Hilton, I'll just use Hilton.
**Skrumenacker**: Right.
**Jremillard**: If Hilton said that, they would say, well, they have different brand types, but one brand type says, I'll accept the ptac.
**Jremillard**: The other one says, it's completely unacceptable.
**Jremillard**: Right, right.
**Jremillard**: So that's.
**Skrumenacker**: Yeah.
**Skrumenacker**: You know.
**Skrumenacker**: Yeah.
**Housh**: And I wonder, too, Jesse, if there's.
**Housh**: If they're talking with Reverb, if we start planning around that, like, if that's the general level they're going with, we could start going that way if we could get a hold of their.
**Housh**: Their standards, what they're looking for.
**Skrumenacker**: They.
**Skrumenacker**: The.
**Housh**: The brain controls a lot.
**Housh**: Even.
**Housh**: Even time.
**Housh**: Time for hot water to reach the faucet, for example.
**Housh**: Know, like, so that might direct how we handle hot water, for example.
**Housh**: So there's.
**Housh**: There's a lot of different things that they.
**Housh**: They will look for.
**Skrumenacker**: Okay.
**Skrumenacker**: All right.
**Tgreen**: Yeah, we'll try and get that dialed in this next week for sure.
**Skrumenacker**: Okay.
**Skrumenacker**: All right.
**Tgreen**: And then as far as.
**Tgreen**: Yeah, I mean, the site layout, like I said, I'll work with Hoosh, and we'll get kind of an orientation of the building.
**Tgreen**: You know, the whole.
**Tgreen**: The.
**Tgreen**: You know, the collective part of it.
**Tgreen**: I don't know if anyone.
**Tgreen**: If you guys have been involved in a container type setup before.
**Tgreen**: So I'll share my screen here.
**Tgreen**: Get this drawing up.
**Tgreen**: You know, I need to share, you know, once we get.
**Tgreen**: I just need to organize things a little better so we can share it.
**Tgreen**: You know, this is what we started.
**Tgreen**: If, you know, we've been really.
**Tgreen**: We've had this project, we've been looking at it for the last seven months, you know, as they, you know, we're working with the, with the local city there.
**Tgreen**: And it says Savannah, Georgia, but it's actually Port Wentworth is the name of the town, but it's right in the Savannah area.
**Tgreen**: And so it started out just as this.
**Tgreen**: It's a container complex.
**Tgreen**: We're doing another one of these for them in.
**Tgreen**: In Florida, near Orlando.
**Tgreen**: But you know, all the little words you can read here, but they're basically, you know, there's the.
**Tgreen**: The containers is their kind of design.
**Tgreen**: So they'll have all these containers built in there, which, you know, at this point, you know, we.
**Tgreen**: We've been contacting some companies that, you know, they'll.
**Tgreen**: All you do is rough in a sewer connection and a water connection and bring some power in.
**Tgreen**: And then they bring the containers completely built and they just set them on top and they're done.
**Tgreen**: So, you know, I gotta just look at the, you know, the cost of that versus if we had the containers brought and we build them out on the inside.
**Tgreen**: This owner is a they.
**Tgreen**: They have restaurants that they own and manage all over.
**Tgreen**: So they have their own kitchen equipment vendor, they provide all their own kitchen equipment, they install all that.
**Tgreen**: So all we'll be doing is coordinating with them, you know, the different requirements, how much power, water, etc.
**Tgreen**: That we need for all these containers, but that, you know, then in this area they got volleyball courts, the pickleball courts, they'll have a little mini putt putt golf course.
**Tgreen**: They got some other structures out here.
**Tgreen**: And then this is.
**Tgreen**: And you look in the picture, you see this big caged or canopy here.
**Tgreen**: So that's basically just a covering for where they have concerts and things like that out here.
**Tgreen**: So that's what Steve is.
**Tgreen**: He'll be designing that structure.
**Tgreen**: So we'll have to, you know, be going in to define, you know, when you look at these little boxes, it's like a coffee shop and a sandwich shop.
**Tgreen**: And these are all just little container restaurants around this area.
**Tgreen**: You know, they'll have.
**Tgreen**: They want to do container restrooms.
**Tgreen**: So everything that's on this site will be the.
**Tgreen**: The building supposed to look like a container.
**Tgreen**: If it's not.
**Tgreen**: If we actually.
**Tgreen**: It's possible, you know, we'll either convert containers or there's companies also that manufacture little buildings.
**Tgreen**: Basically it looked like a container, but they're, you know, 100% fabricated in their, in their factory.
**Tgreen**: So that's this, that's what this area is here.
**Skrumenacker**: And.
**Tgreen**: See here, where is that this drawing?
**Tgreen**: So, and this is what I emailed everybody.
**Tgreen**: You know, we were working a little bit with our in house guy to do some kind of lay this out where it fits over the, the site plan.
**Tgreen**: And so, you know, this is the parcel that given us for the hotel.
**Tgreen**: And then this is the parcel we're fitting in the container element of it.
**Tgreen**: So, you know, there's parking and like I said, the volleyball courts and all those things.
**Tgreen**: So we'll get that, you know, get this design what fits and works best for all of that on this side.
**Tgreen**: And the cool thing about this development, you know, I give you an idea.
**Tgreen**: This is where it's located.
**Tgreen**: You know, this is Savannah.
**Tgreen**: There's the airport and this piece of property that.
**Tgreen**: So the city, they've got a great, you know, team on their development side.
**Tgreen**: And this is going to be one giant sports complex.
**Tgreen**: And we're building out, you know, the hotels right here.
**Tgreen**: And then that container area is right here.
**Tgreen**: And then down here they've got, I think amphitheater.
**Tgreen**: They got an indoor ice hockey rink they're putting in.
**Tgreen**: And you know, you see they got baseball diamonds, soccer fields.
**Tgreen**: So, you know, they very much like the collective coming in.
**Tgreen**: That's their concept is the bar, restaurants, events and containers.
**Tgreen**: And you know, the volleyball.
**Skrumenacker**: The.
**Tgreen**: They are teamed up with Volleyball usa and I had no idea how big volleyball is in this country.
**Tgreen**: But like, it's a giant thing.
**Tgreen**: I mean, we're building currently in Westfield, which is by Indianapolis.
**Tgreen**: It's called the Westfield Collective.
**Tgreen**: And it's.
**Tgreen**: They've got, I think four or five indoor volleyball courts in this big building on half of it.
**Tgreen**: And then the other half of it is two stories of bars and restaurants and coffee shops and it's got the largest TV in Indiana or the US on the wall.
**Tgreen**: It's this thing's like 100ft long or something.
**Tgreen**: It's gigantic.
**Tgreen**: So, you know, and.
**Tgreen**: But the volleyball, like there's outdoor volleyball courts that were built before we started our project.
**Tgreen**: And like every day it's just loaded up with people.
**Tgreen**: Like in the winter here in Indiana, they're out there playing.
**Tgreen**: So.
**Housh**: Wow, that's dedication.
**Tgreen**: It is like every day our guys, they go out and pick up like 20 volleyballs off our construction site to get, you know, we've had, we started erecting the building.
**Tgreen**: We had to tell them they couldn't.
**Tgreen**: They can't play volleyball during the day.
**Tgreen**: They didn't have to wait till, you know, we're done swinging steel.
**Skrumenacker**: But.
**Tgreen**: But that's just kind of an overview of like where we're building, what we're building and you know, this is, it's going to be a great project.
**Tgreen**: It's going to be a really cool place.
**Housh**: Very cool.
**Sandy**: That's exciting.
**Skrumenacker**: It's cool.
**Skrumenacker**: Yeah.
**Skrumenacker**: Yeah.
**Housh**: And as all that collective area comes together and I know you're looking at a few different options of modular or pre built or not pre built or whatever.
**Housh**: Just let us know and we can bring the team around it to make sure you get what you need.
**Skrumenacker**: Yep.
**Tgreen**: Yeah, I mean that's something we gotta also I gotta get figured out early on which direction we're going there.
**Skrumenacker**: Yeah.
**Tgreen**: Getting them.
**Tgreen**: So.
**Tgreen**: And I guess the last thing, if you could all also figure.
**Tgreen**: So we can figure out our timeline for getting the design completed, you know, some milestones for the owner and you know, if you'd send me dates.
**Skrumenacker**: Okay.
**Housh**: Do you have any.
**Bclymer**: May I ask a question real quick, Jesse, as far as phasing out the project.
**Skrumenacker**: Do I.
**Bclymer**: Is this project going to be phased just one phase or do you have multiple phases?
**Tgreen**: Just one phase.
**Skrumenacker**: Just one phase.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: And also we can talk you into building more hotel units.
**Skrumenacker**: Could we?
**Tgreen**: Well, that I need to ask them.
**Tgreen**: Until I talked to you yesterday, I didn't really think about it.
**Tgreen**: You know, they just said they wanted a 60 units.
**Tgreen**: But you know, and I don't know if that's something with the city.
**Tgreen**: Maybe they, they can only put so many up there that I don't know.
**Skrumenacker**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Because I don't think 60 is enough is what I'm really guessing based on.
**Bclymer**: Based on your vision.
**Bclymer**: You know, this will be a. I think I'm.
**Bclymer**: I'm guessing that it'll be a heavy duty complex with a lot of usage, overnight stays and competitions and things like that.
**Bclymer**: So I don't think 60.
**Bclymer**: So anyhow, if you work that out with the neighbor.
**Bclymer**: Neighbors, that would be the ownership.
**Bclymer**: That would be nice.
**Skrumenacker**: Yeah.
**Tgreen**: I mean Justin and Steve can make it higher.
**Tgreen**: What is the.
**Tgreen**: What it comes to parking though?
**Tgreen**: Are we limited?
**Tgreen**: Like we can't put it 300 rooms there.
**Tgreen**: Where are we going to park everybody?
**Bclymer**: Typically 1.1.
**Bclymer**: Typically 1.1 rooms per unit.
**Bclymer**: Spaces per unit.
**Housh**: Yeah, they're all, they're all there.
**Housh**: I know this is like a pd, right?
**Housh**: So there might be some unique things that we could get.
**Housh**: But you could also structure parking, too, if you need to.
**Housh**: I mean it.
**Housh**: Depending on how high you go and what the appetite for budget is and all of that, there's a lot of variables.
**Housh**: And I know there's.
**Housh**: There's always a balancing act there.
**Skrumenacker**: But yeah, if you, if they need.
**Housh**: More, can get more, we can, we can find a way to make it work.
**Skrumenacker**: Okay.
**Housh**: Going.
**Housh**: Going back on your schedule comment, are there.
**Housh**: Are there particular important milestones from the owner or city or getting approvals that we need to try to align our design schedule with?
**Tgreen**: No, I don't.
**Tgreen**: I don't have a end date right now.
**Tgreen**: We'd like to start the project, you know, before the end of the year.
**Tgreen**: I would think that wouldn't be a monumental task or I don't know what.
**Housh**: Start construction by the end of the year.
**Tgreen**: Well, moving dirt.
**Bclymer**: I don't think so.
**Bclymer**: Jesse, I think by day you might have the survey in hand.
**Tgreen**: Oh, come on.
**Tgreen**: These people are motivated.
**Bclymer**: So we're in July is what I'm saying.
**Skrumenacker**: Yeah.
**Tgreen**: Well, like, if we just have that, as, you know, we could.
**Bclymer**: Could we set up a meeting with the city as quickly as possible just to discuss the project?
**Bclymer**: And I think that'd be critical as far as density requirements, parking, you know, backside.
**Skrumenacker**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Retention pond, drainage, utilities, all that really need to come to play.
**Bclymer**: So the sooner we have that meeting with the city, I think the sooner we can figure out how to design.
**Skrumenacker**: Yeah.
**Skrumenacker**: And any.
**Housh**: Also, like, in addition to the survey comment, just, you know, we'll need the geotech.
**Housh**: We'll need environmental also.
**Housh**: I mean, it's all wooded right now, and I see a little serpentine river there, too.
**Housh**: Like what are there, you know, flood.
**Housh**: Flood plains or.
**Housh**: I don't know if Georgia has the same kind of wetlands as Florida.
**Housh**: I know Florida.
**Housh**: I'd be peeking at that pretty heavy.
**Housh**: So make sure we have usable what we think we have usable.
**Skrumenacker**: Okay.
**Tgreen**: And are you able to.
**Tgreen**: You just go to like a. Jurisdictions.
**Housh**: So for floodplains.
**Housh**: Yeah, usually floodplains you can find there through fema.
**Housh**: And then local jurisdictions may have an further overlay, like Clearwater does, for example.
**Housh**: But wetlands are typically site specific.
**Housh**: Need to be done on a survey as well as environmental.
**Tgreen**: All right, I'll check into all that and I'll set up that meeting with the city.
**Skrumenacker**: Right.
**Tgreen**: Also, they got any, like, I don't know, their design standards for the city that we got to meet to.
**Tgreen**: Oh, that's something.
**Skrumenacker**: Yeah.
**Housh**: That might be part of the PUD or whatever that whole.
**Housh**: This whole master plan is.
**Housh**: May have some controls, design guidelines.
**Skrumenacker**: Yeah.
**Skrumenacker**: Okay.
**Tgreen**: Well, good deal.
**Tgreen**: Well, I will keep everyone.
**Tgreen**: Again, like I said, if you would just.
**Skrumenacker**: Everyone.
**Tgreen**: Send me everyone who needs to be copied on certain, you know, types of information or emails or when we put you in as your contacts into our system, that'll help me get everyone set up.
**Skrumenacker**: Right.
**Tgreen**: And I'll follow up in two weeks from today.
**Tgreen**: We'll meet again.
**Bclymer**: Do we need to engage a landscape architect?
**Skrumenacker**: Yes.
**Skrumenacker**: Yep.
**Tgreen**: I'm gonna have you do that too.
**Skrumenacker**: Whoosh.
**Tgreen**: Thanks.
**Sandy**: Jesse, you said that this is one phase.
**Sandy**: Are you thinking, though, that the.
**Sandy**: That the Port Collective piece and the hotel will be documented, submitted in like, two different.
**Sandy**: Two different packages?
**Sandy**: Is that how you'd envision it happening?
**Tgreen**: We'll probably pull two permits.
**Tgreen**: Two different permits for it.
**Skrumenacker**: Yeah.
**Skrumenacker**: Okay.
**Tgreen**: We'll build it just at the same time.
**Skrumenacker**: Gotcha.
**Skrumenacker**: Okay.
**Tgreen**: And then Steve, I got a local structural sub.
**Tgreen**: He's.
**Tgreen**: I've worked with him on several jobs.
**Tgreen**: He would be doing the canopy.
**Tgreen**: And he's a good guy to talk to about, you know, whatever design you're going for.
**Tgreen**: He can.
**Tgreen**: He can give, you know, what is the price of this versus that, Things like that.
**Skrumenacker**: Okay.
**Tgreen**: You know, he's built airplane hangars and everything else, so he's a structural steel.
**Tgreen**: Structural steel, Yep.
**Skrumenacker**: Yeah.
**Skrumenacker**: Okay.
**Sandy**: Yeah, I think we'll have.
**Sandy**: We'll obviously work with Justin on that in terms of the.
**Sandy**: The aesthetics and, you know, is it.
**Sandy**: I'm assuming it wants to be largely clear span, but it's a big space, so.
**Skrumenacker**: Yeah.
**Skrumenacker**: Okay.
**Skrumenacker**: Yeah.
**Sandy**: Be good to have somebody like that to bounce things off of.
**Skrumenacker**: Yeah.
**Tgreen**: He's telling me about.
**Tgreen**: I don't remember the name of it, but it was like 160 foot span.
**Tgreen**: I don't know if that seems crazy, but because it was some big airport hangar and they.
**Skrumenacker**: It was.
**Tgreen**: However they designed it, it kind of held itself up, so.
**Sandy**: Oh, gotcha.
**Skrumenacker**: Okay.
**Tgreen**: Something similar to this would be.
**Tgreen**: Because it is.
**Tgreen**: It's gigantic.
**Tgreen**: And I can't imagine they'd want a bunch of columns on the inside.
**Skrumenacker**: Right.
**Tgreen**: Trying to look at a.
**Tgreen**: The stage, so.
**Sandy**: Yeah.
**Skrumenacker**: Yeah.
**Housh**: It's the worst.
**Skrumenacker**: All right.
**Skrumenacker**: All right, everybody.
**Tgreen**: Anyone else?
**Tgreen**: Anything good?
**Housh**: Yeah, thanks again.
**Tgreen**: All right, excellent.
**Skrumenacker**: Looking forward to it.
**Tgreen**: Thanks, everybody.
**Sandy**: We'll talk soon.
**Sandy**: All righty.
**Housh**: Take care.
**Sandy**: Have a great weekend.
**Skrumenacker**: Weekend.
**Housh**: See y'.
**Skrumenacker**: All.
**Sandy**: Thank you.
**Skrumenacker**: Sa.
