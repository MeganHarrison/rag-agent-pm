**Bclymer**: Hey, good morning.
**Bclymer**: How are y'all doing today?
**Jdawson**: Hello.
**Accounting**: Good morning.
**Bkinnaman**: Hey.
**Bclymer**: You having a good morning?
**Accounting**: Well, thank you.
**Bclymer**: I get on a call from your side to help configure that.
**Bclymer**: Would that be the accounting email or, like, Jesse or you?
**Bclymer**: Brandon, I can set up a meeting with Ashley and get the phase two team involved and try to expedite this.
**Accounting**: Yeah, I mean, Jose, I brought him on because he knows acumatica.
**Accounting**: Like.
**Accounting**: Like, this has to be figured out.
**Accounting**: Like.
**Accounting**: Like the fact that it's just like, oh, it doesn't work, and then we don't see any movement and I gotta push everybody all the time like this.
**Accounting**: Like, if I can, I can do this, I can stop what I'm doing and I can get this done today.
**Accounting**: If it were me and, like, the fact that we have a whole team of people that I'm paying and nobody's getting anything done, they're just like, oh, it doesn't work.
**Accounting**: And then that's it.
**Accounting**: Like, it's done.
**Accounting**: Like, we have an outcome.
**Accounting**: This has to work.
**Accounting**: Like, it's.
**Accounting**: It's worked before and, like, there's no reason it can't work now.
**Accounting**: So, Jose, I don't know, like, I want nothing done until this is figured out.
**Accounting**: Like, this is it.
**Accounting**: Like that.
**Accounting**: This is the number one priority is figure out why we were able to upload it once, but now we can't upload them anymore.
**Accounting**: Jose, you're muted if you're talking.
**Accounting**: Jose, unmute yourself.
**Bkinnaman**: Yeah, sorry, I was in mute.
**Bkinnaman**: Yeah, I am saying that I am preparing just the file to be uploading live, and I hope to make the uploading live qmatica in a few because I'm just finished to prepare the just file, but I hope this will work because it's the same file we were using in test, and in test it works.
**Accounting**: Okay, we'll upload it and then I.
**Accounting**: I don't care if you and Ashley have to be on a meeting for five hours.
**Accounting**: Like, the meeting doesn't end until it works, period.
**Accounting**: Like, work it out.
**Accounting**: Not like, okay, I'll go try.
**Accounting**: Like, no, try it right then and there, like in the meeting.
**Accounting**: Oh, this doesn't work.
**Accounting**: What do you need me to just adjust it?
**Accounting**: Like, but figure this out, because if I have to step in and do all this, everybody's fired.
**Accounting**: Yeah.
**Bkinnaman**: Okay.
**Accounting**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: Am I clear?
**Bkinnaman**: Yes.
**Accounting**: Okay, so that is the goal.
