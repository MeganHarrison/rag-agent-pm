## Transcript
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Maybe two foot from that ES band.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Everything's framed above that, you know, above those window openings.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: That's, you know, the steel columns are behind, you know, the brick veneer, you know, the red brick, and then there's a, you know, a ledger, and then everything's framed from there above it.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: And I think the.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: If you go around the backside of the parapet, maybe.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: I don't know if it's.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: I believe it's less than.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: It's like two to three feet, isn't it, Jack?
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: You're muted, Jack.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Yeah, it is.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So we will have, if we.
**Amulder**: Went, to be safe, three foot down from the parapet to the bottom of the band or to the top of the band.
**Amulder**: We could figure out how much square footage is available to us and we can figure out where your columns are and then make sure we have enough square footage of glass and probably the way to back into it.
**Amulder**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: We will have a sign on that side kind of where that gray rectangle area is.
**Jdawson**: So we.
**Jdawson**: I think we just fill the left side of that area in.
**Jdawson**: And even on the other side of the canopy, you can add one there.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Yep.
**Amulder**: Okay.
**Amulder**: Both sides of the entry.
**Amulder**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: The back side of the canopy, that's full height cmu.
**Jdawson**: Oh, it is.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Amulder**: Yeah, yeah, yeah, it is.
**Amulder**: So is the spine.
**Amulder**: Is it in the.
**Amulder**: In the articulated band or up in the lighter colored eis?
**Jdawson**: The lighter efis.
**Amulder**: We're running out of square footage.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Kind of the same elevation as that canopy is right now.
**Jcurtin**: Option two would just be like taking the CMU back out and putting in glass there and building that wall back there.
**Jcurtin**: Is that.
**Jcurtin**: Think about that.
**Jdawson**: I don't know if Bloomington will like that.
**Jdawson**: We had another building where we were going to do that and they shot that down.
**Jdawson**: Because the other thing is you can't tint it or it has to look like you have to see through it.
**Jdawson**: A building, basically.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Amulder**: There they got smart because we were.
**Amulder**: Everywhere else.
**Amulder**: We just do that and make it spandal glass.
**Amulder**: You know what I'm saying?
**Amulder**: Tack those windows on to already what you built.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, but I mean, if we put that wall back there and put in just a.
**Jcurtin**: We could come up with some generic, you know, pull some Goodwill graphics.
**Amulder**: That's what I do.
**Amulder**: I make a white wall, put graphics on it, turn that into signage and.
**Jcurtin**: Just have that two and a half feet so it's accessible.
**Amulder**: Yeah.
**Amulder**: Let us draw both those options up.
**Amulder**: Sure.
**Jdawson**: I'll bring that to our marketing director.
**Jdawson**: I don't know if they'll need, like, permits for that, if that's included as, like, exterior signs or not.
**Amulder**: But if we do the window, like Jerome's saying, and put the glass, put the wall behind it from that's inside the building, even though you're going to see it.
**Amulder**: Yeah, but it's Bloomington.
**Amulder**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: I would think, like, it's.
**Jcurtin**: It's meeting.
**Jcurtin**: It's meeting the intent.
**Jcurtin**: I can't imagine how they would.
**Amulder**: Yeah, so let's draw both those up and show them to you on later this week.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: And what about the front section, Nick?
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Is it similar or is that Would.
**Amulder**: Would.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Because those were a lot smaller window.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Because the elevation change.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Could that be at the end of.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Of transom windows?
**Amulder**: You have the existing drawings?
**Amulder**: We can see what those existing square footage is.
**Amulder**: Oh, yeah.
**Jcurtin**: I mean, it's just.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, I think it's that.
**Jcurtin**: That.
**Jcurtin**: That was also infilled there, right?
**Jcurtin**: No, that one.
**Amulder**: Right.
**Jcurtin**: So it really just.
**Amulder**: It's the.
**Jcurtin**: Up to that.
**Jcurtin**: Up to that band there, I think.
**Amulder**: Yeah.
**Amulder**: Okay.
**Amulder**: Does this need to go through your designer, Andrew Steven?
**Amulder**: I think.
**Jdawson**: No, not the.
**Jdawson**: Not the transom windows.
**Jdawson**: We just need to make a spot for his signs.
**Jdawson**: That's really all he cares about.
**Amulder**: Okay.
**Amulder**: He.
**Jdawson**: If we do go with the glass and the graphics behind it, he'll want to know about that.
**Jdawson**: But if you mock it up, he'll.
**Jdawson**: We can go from there.
**Amulder**: Oh, yeah.
**Amulder**: Let's see if we can make the transcendence work first.
**Amulder**: Yeah.
**Amulder**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: We'll get something drawn up and out to the group so we can keep the.
**Jcurtin**: Keep the conversation going, obviously, before Tuesday, before we meet, but then try to get.
**Jcurtin**: Get aligned here.
**Jdawson**: Sounds good.
**Amulder**: All right.
**Amulder**: All right, thanks, guys.
**Amulder**: Thanks.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: See you.
