**Bclymer**: Good afternoon, everyone.

**Bclymer**: It's looking good.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Can I can flip this thing?
**Bclymer**: There it is.
**Bclymer**: Drive around that way on the exit, kind of get a look at it on the way out.
**Steve.bishop**: So the one you're looking at here for our site, that.
**Steve.bishop**: That similar.
**Steve.bishop**: Similar in size.
**Steve.bishop**: And.
**Bclymer**: So the, the one in Seminole county will be a little bit more indoor.
**Mewers**: Outdoor.
**Bclymer**: The way that we're designing it, obviously we don't have the, the climate like you guys, so we played into it here with the garage doors and everything, but it'll be more boardwalk style, indoor outdoor flow than.
**Bclymer**: Than this one.
**Bclymer**: But we'll probably have similar.
**Bclymer**: There's five restaurant concepts in here.
**Bclymer**: That's.
**Bclymer**: That's tentatively five to six in Seminole.
**Bclymer**: Three bar spaces, coffee shop, all an ice cream shop.

**Bclymer**: We got a second floor patio, first floor patio on this one, and all the sand's going in this week.
**Steve.bishop**: And how long was construction on that.
**Bclymer**: Construction on this one from start to Finish was about 15 months.
**Bclymer**: We ran into a couple delays on some things, permitting and such, but again, I think we can move much quicker with.
**Bclymer**: With Seminole just because of the design being different in that indoor outdoor flow versus such a.
**Bclymer**: This is about 20,000 square feet in inside.
**Mewers**: All right.
**Steve.bishop**: And that.

**Bclymer**: If you want to kick Firefly the.
**Bclymer**: The AI note taker out, feel free.
**Steve.bishop**: Just a.
**Steve.bishop**: A reference here because I know we're going to discuss some deal points.
**Steve.bishop**: If there is an AI Notetaker, we believe that's going to become a public record and can be referenced.
**Steve.bishop**: So the county does not have an AI note taker, but in case we continue with the meeting with the AI note taker, it'll be at the discretion of.
**Steve.bishop**: I don't know who has it on, but it'll be that person who has to keep the file for historic reference that could be asked by the county.

**Steve.bishop**: To get rid of the fireflies.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
