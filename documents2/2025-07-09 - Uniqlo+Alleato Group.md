## Transcript
**Aelkarrimy**: Hey, Brian.
**Bclymer**: Hey, Jesse.
**Bclymer**: How's it going?
**Aelkarrimy**: Pretty good.
**Aelkarrimy**: How about yourself?
**Bclymer**: Not too bad.
**Aelkarrimy**: The deal get through the fourth weekend without fireworks incidents?
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Well, mostly I got all my fingers and toes.
**Bclymer**: Neighbors.
**Bclymer**: Neighbors were and I were shooting things back and forth at each other a little bit, but nobody ended up with any injuries.
**Bclymer**: That's all that matters.
**Aelkarrimy**: That's right.
**Aelkarrimy**: As long as no one gets hurt.
**Aelkarrimy**: It's all.
**Kevin.ly**: Hey, guys.
**Mparsons**: Hello.
**Jdawson**: My God.
**Jdawson**: I got everything I need.
**Jdawson**: This is amazing.
**Jdawson**: It's awesome.
**Aelkarrimy**: Sorry, is it from us?
**Kevin.ly**: When you get an email filled with all the answers you really need, it's.
**Mparsons**: Always great.
**Aelkarrimy**: You broke up there, but the last thing we heard is we do everything you need.
**Jdawson**: Skin.
**Aelkarrimy**: All right, Kevin.
**Jdawson**: We wait.
**Aelkarrimy**: Are we waiting for anybody here?
**Mparsons**: I think we are good to go.
**Mparsons**: Is Uck in?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I'm here.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Mparsons**: I'm going to share my screen and we can go through this quick.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: This is last week minutes.
**Mparsons**: We discussed mainly the change orders that we sent over with the clarifications and on the schedule we was.
**Mparsons**: We were supposed to get started with the feeders to the HE1 panel, which we have begun.
**Aelkarrimy**: You want to start give us a rundown what's going on on site?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yes.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So as far as the feeders for the to the main power distribution, we haven't started.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: There's been a slight delay and getting outside but.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And getting that.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: But we have been getting prepared.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And then once.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Once we are ready to get outside of our construction area, that's when I plan to make sure I communicate with Ted Chesky and get him involved and make sure that we're all on the same page about exactly when we will be outside of our construction area.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Other than that, that material got delivered all of the wire and panel material.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And then our plumbing material got delivered today as well.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So that's where we're at on site right now.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Mparsons**: And yeah, like he mentioned, we this week we are doing the HE1 panel feeder install and upcoming events.
**Mparsons**: We have the demo of the floor for the plumbers and they have, as Mike said, they have their material there today and they will be doing the floor demo on starting Monday.
**Mparsons**: And then we are moving on to the drain and waste drain waste and vent install starting on the 16th.
**Mparsons**: And then the next thing for the electrician is the panel install which is supposed to start on the 29th after the HD1 panel is in place for RFIs.
**Mparsons**: I sent out an RFI today for the relocation of the HD1 panel because we on the drawing that we Received the current location.
**Mparsons**: There is a door behind it, A duct door.
**Mparsons**: Unless if we can put it right in front of the door, we might have to relocate it.
**Mparsons**: And I sent the RFI out for clarification.
**Mparsons**: This is the current location, which is missing the dark door.
**Mparsons**: But there's supposed to be a dark door.
**Mparsons**: And there is a space here which is right outside of the fenced area that we can put it in.
**Mparsons**: We will have to move the filings extinguisher that's on this wall.
**Mparsons**: Maybe we can put it here so we can fit the panel there.
**Aelkarrimy**: I guess the question is, like, do they need that dock door?
**Aelkarrimy**: Because at this point now we.
**Aelkarrimy**: Like now are we changing all our feeder lengths to the transformers and everything out in the warehouse?
**Bclymer**: I mean.
**Bclymer**: Yes, you'll have to adjust feeder lengths from HE one to everything else.
**Bclymer**: I mean, what is that distance, Keva?
**Bclymer**: 50ft, maybe?
**Mparsons**: Yeah, it looks about 50 from column through column.
**Mparsons**: About 50?
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: So a little.
**Bclymer**: Little less than 50.
**Jdawson**: But.
**Bclymer**: So from an.
**Bclymer**: From an engineering standpoint, not concerned.
**Bclymer**: Too concerned with an additional 50ft or so feeder length.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: Was it.
**Aelkarrimy**: They thought that that was not a doctor previously?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: From.
**Bclymer**: From the backgrounds, there wasn't a dock door there, I believe Ahmed.
**Bclymer**: So yeah, there wasn't.
**Jdawson**: That wasn't a Hurry up.
**Kevin.ly**: But Yusuke, did we.
**Kevin.ly**: Did we get confirmation that we can install the TLE one and the LE one in that location?
**Bryan.wagar**: The location for the sublease, right?
**Kevin.ly**: Yes.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, we're actually.
**Bryan.wagar**: We.
**Kevin.ly**: So this is where we would plan for that relocation.
**Bryan.wagar**: Option B, right?
**Bryan.wagar**: This is option B, right?
**Bryan.wagar**: It's not original plan, right?
**Mparsons**: No.
**Mparsons**: So the original is inside the sublist area.
**Jdawson**: Yes, yes.
**Mparsons**: That would basically be in front of this door.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Mparsons**: Okay, so we are down here outside of the fence.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bryan.wagar**: Mike, have you talked with Ted about this one?
**Bryan.wagar**: I think Ted is waiting for a little bit more detail for the space and the schedule that Ted can confirm with the sublease guy.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: No, I haven't talked to Ted about this specific area here.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I've mainly been talking to Ted about the.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: The wire run to their office area.
**Mparsons**: Down.
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Down near the power room area.
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay, good.
**Bryan.wagar**: Then I think, Kevin, you mentioned a little bit more little detail for the schedule of this one.
**Bryan.wagar**: So I can inform this schedule to Ted and Ted can talk to Stublis that.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Kevin.ly**: I think for the sake of time, Yusuke, Mike, and Keba, if you guys are able to send a markup to Ted, letting him know that this is what we're trying to Do.
**Kevin.ly**: And the duration to get this point from this point where the panels now outside of the fenced area within our area of work to that L E1 and transformer.
**Kevin.ly**: What is the duration from Tim to get that work completed?
**Kevin.ly**: Because Ted is going to need that information to supply to the.
**Kevin.ly**: To that adjacent tenant.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: So.
**Mparsons**: So as of now.
**Mparsons**: So the plan is to put it here.
**Mparsons**: So we just.
**Kevin.ly**: Now the panel.
**Kevin.ly**: That panel clash.
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah, that can go there.
**Kevin.ly**: But then the transformer and the L E1 will still reside by that bathroom behind the men's restroom.
**Jdawson**: Yep, right there.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Kevin.ly**: So that's their concern is the duration for that installation from H E1 to TLE1 and LE1.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And it should be shorter.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: The duration should be shorter with moving that.
**Jdawson**: But yeah.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah, we'll get that information.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Kevin.ly**: Because then once you.
**Kevin.ly**: Once you get that coordinated with Ted and he gets us the approval, then we're good to go.
**Kevin.ly**: And I know I've started an email chain regarding this topic previously with ted, but I did not receive any.
**Kevin.ly**: Any response.
**Kevin.ly**: So just now that you guys are in full gears with him, I think he'll be able to get us a response faster.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: And so the next item is the switch locations.
**Mparsons**: I don't know if that would be you, Ahmed, or it would be the engineers where to decide where we would put the switches for the lights.
**Bclymer**: That'd be us, Keba.
**Bclymer**: Do you have a.
**Bclymer**: A plan you can share?
**Bclymer**: I thought we had switches designated on our drawings.
**Mparsons**: No, I don't think so.
**Mparsons**: I sent an email out yesterday.
**Mparsons**: I think I met forwarded it to you guys.
**Mparsons**: You see, I can open it up here.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And I didn't see those switches on.
**Aelkarrimy**: The plants Just pull up the latest lighting plan, Kevin.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: But the two main options, if otherwise would be right there near the HE1 panel location on that wall or indicated area near the lighting panel, the control panel that we have now.
**Bclymer**: Ahmed.
**Bclymer**: Oh, no, there they are.
**Bclymer**: There's switches shown.
**Jdawson**: Oh, I see them.
**Bclymer**: There's one at the north end of system B.
**Bclymer**: Or no, sorry, System A at the dock or at the egress door.
**Bclymer**: Nope, sorry.
**Kevin.ly**: By the Skypod fence.
**Jdawson**: Thank you.
**Bclymer**: Skypod fence.
**Bclymer**: That's what I was looking for.
**Kevin.ly**: Right right there on the right side by Skypod A.
**Kevin.ly**: Plan A on the right.
**Jdawson**: Move your mouse to the right.
**Jdawson**: More to the right.
**Jdawson**: More to the right.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah, it says he 1:38 switch there.
**Jdawson**: On the right side.
**Jdawson**: Gotcha.
**Jdawson**: On the right side right there.
**Jdawson**: Yep, got it.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bschwartz**: That you're not putting that inside the sky plot, are you.
**Kevin.ly**: Where would you like to have it placed?
**Kevin.ly**: Because right now I thought that the servicer would come in and then.
**Kevin.ly**: Then he would trigger the light when they're ready to do so.
**Kevin.ly**: So it doesn't affect the system?
**Jdawson**: No.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: If that.
**Bschwartz**: If that was the plan, that's fine.
**Kevin.ly**: Is that.
**Kevin.ly**: Is that what you were envisioning?
**Kevin.ly**: Because like, again, we need to dictate a little bit where to place them.
**Kevin.ly**: But.
**Kevin.ly**: But right now, Brian, is that.
**Kevin.ly**: Isn't that the case that everything is within the Skypod system?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Everything in there would be on the switch so that they'd be off during normal operation and turned on during.
**Bschwartz**: No, I like that.
**Bschwartz**: I like that best, to be honest.
**Kevin.ly**: It's like a good contingency plan, you know, like he will not.
**Kevin.ly**: You can't turn them on unless you walk in.
**Jdawson**: Correct.
**Bschwartz**: Is there any other switches anywhere else?
**Aelkarrimy**: Where's he.
**Bclymer**: 140 switch that may have fallen off our drawings, but I would assume we would mirror that over to the other door on the B system.
**Mparsons**: So don't you.
**Bschwartz**: Because he's not just going to come in from this door per se.
**Bschwartz**: There are other doors.
**Bschwartz**: That's my only concern is that they're gonna have to walk all the way to the.
**Bschwartz**: Up to the backside, turn the switch on, and then go all the way wherever they need to go.
**Kevin.ly**: Is there an issue with that or.
**Bschwartz**: I mean, there's not.
**Bschwartz**: I mean it's just.
**Bschwartz**: It's a.
**Bschwartz**: It's a long walk to go all the way to the back because the maintenance.
**Bschwartz**: I don't know where that went.
**Bschwartz**: The maintenance is on the other side.
**Bschwartz**: The maintenance cage just put on one.
**Aelkarrimy**: Of those clapper light switches.
**Bclymer**: So would they be more efficiently placed in the maintenance area?
**Bclymer**: Just a single switch.
**Jdawson**: I mean, if that, if.
**Bschwartz**: If this is the plan to that it's always off until the maintenance person needs to go enter into it.
**Bschwartz**: Yes, I would say so.
**Bclymer**: And there's a mate.
**Bclymer**: There's a maintenance area on each side.
**Bclymer**: So you would just flip those to the page south at each of those locations.
**Bschwartz**: On the bottom right corner and the bottom left corner.
**Bschwartz**: Those are.
**Bschwartz**: Those are ca.
**Bschwartz**: Those cages.
**Bschwartz**: That's a maintenance cage.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: That.
**Bclymer**: That's probably the more efficient location for those switches.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Kevin.ly**: Would come to this area first to disengage the system and the lights and then.
**Kevin.ly**: And I'm sorry.
**Kevin.ly**: And then engage the lights and then they can go about their way.
**Bschwartz**: Yeah.
**Bschwartz**: So the system.
**Bschwartz**: If he has to enter the system.
**Aelkarrimy**: There's.
**Bschwartz**: There's probably there's only two reasons to enter the system.
**Bschwartz**: One is to.
**Bschwartz**: One would be something's already down.
**Bschwartz**: So the system's down anyways.
**Bschwartz**: But they.
**Bschwartz**: They don't disengage the system until they hit the doors, and then they take the key lock out.
**Bschwartz**: So, yes, they can flip on the switch and then go around and then disengage the system if they need to.
**Bclymer**: Does that maintenance area door automatically disengage the system, or is that a.
**Bschwartz**: No, the maintenance door can go.
**Bschwartz**: Because that cage, the maintenance door, does not disengage the system.
**Bschwartz**: Only the doors on the outside do.
**Bclymer**: So I kind of feel like I'm just kind of presuming operations here, standard operating procedures, but in the event of a.
**Bclymer**: Of a down downtime or an issue, they're gonna have to go.
**Bclymer**: Probably go to the maintenance area first anyway to get equipment or something to fix the system.
**Jdawson**: So 90.
**Bschwartz**: 90% of their day will be spent in that cage.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So then they'll be in there anyway.
**Bclymer**: So if something happens, they can just flip that switch on, go out to where they need to go into the system, and the lights will be on.
**Jdawson**: Correct.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Kevin.ly**: And if they bring a scooter, they can just ride their scooter around.
**Kevin.ly**: So, Kevin, let's plan for the switches to be directly inside that maintenance area.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: So in here and on the right.
**Jdawson**: Side.
**Bclymer**: And on the door swing side, not the hinge side.
**Kevin.ly**: So exactly there.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: We'Ll track that for the bulletin one issuance as well.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Mparsons**: I think that's it for now.
**Mparsons**: Unless someone else has something to add.
**Bclymer**: I just have a clerical Note.
**Bclymer**: KEBA number one.
**Bclymer**: I did see that RFI one on the HE1 panel relocation was uploaded this morning.
**Bclymer**: If you can, please ensure Marlene from our office gets added as ball in court so she can see those when those get uploaded, because she.
**Bclymer**: She handles all our CA items.
**Bclymer**: And then in conjunction with that, I didn't get any kind of email notification that that RFI had been uploaded.
**Bclymer**: I don't know if that's something on your end or if it's a setting issue on my end so that we don't miss when those get uploaded.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: Ahmed, did you get notified, or was it the same for you?
**Mparsons**: If not, I'm gonna have to go check it.
**Mparsons**: Maybe your permission to see if there's something missing.
**Bryan.wagar**: You sent it in the morning.
**Kevin.ly**: RFI01 opened?
**Kevin.ly**: Yes, for he one panel relocation.
**Kevin.ly**: I did receive a notification.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: All right, I'll check your settings, Brian.
**Bclymer**: Thanks, Keba.
**Bclymer**: And if you can do the same for Marlene as well.
**Bclymer**: That way she and I both get notified when an RFI gets uploaded.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Thank you.
**Jdawson**: You're welcome.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, but I didn't receive that one too.
**Mparsons**: What's that?
**Bryan.wagar**: I didn't receive the notice notification for this one.
**Bryan.wagar**: The rfi.
**Bryan.wagar**: Can you add me into the notification too?
**Mparsons**: I did add you.
**Mparsons**: I'm going to check your settings.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Kevin.ly**: And Yusuke, I spoke with Keva regarding Job Planner.
**Kevin.ly**: So basically when it comes to the daily reports and whatnot, what Kevin is going to try to do is to issue a PDF via email.
**Kevin.ly**: But when you go into Job Planner, you have to hit export in order for you to get that report that he's issuing.
**Kevin.ly**: So that's why we don't see it.
**Kevin.ly**: So you would just have to hit export.
**Kevin.ly**: It will generate a PDF for you.
**Kevin.ly**: Now, the schedule has been now reflected on the schedules tab.
**Kevin.ly**: So you'll be able to see all the schedule and how much the percentage of completion happened.
**Kevin.ly**: So Keba quickly put all of that together with the Job Planner folks this morning.
**Bryan.wagar**: But not the daily report in the weekly report in.
**Mparsons**: So we.
**Bryan.wagar**: How about the minutes?
**Mparsons**: The minutes, I think what Ahmed was talking about.
**Mparsons**: That's the minute.
**Mparsons**: Minute, minutes.
**Mparsons**: But I will have to download them and send it over to you guys because I think when I, when I send them over, you guys are not able to see the PDF for some reason.
**Mparsons**: So when I think if you are.
**Mparsons**: When you, when you click the meeting link and you are in here, if you export, click this to export, it's going to download it as a PDF and it would basically show you this, it will download this for you.
**Mparsons**: So you can have it.
**Mparsons**: But if you want to take a look, this is the.
**Mparsons**: The two tabs, the general information and the agenda.
**Mparsons**: So once the meeting is completed, once you are in here on this attachment here, I do a.
**Mparsons**: An overview and I save it as a Microsoft document and I put it in here.
**Mparsons**: So it's going to be attached to this.
**Mparsons**: So if you are able to see this.
**Bryan.wagar**: Sorry, I think, I think we're seeing only for PDF and not not your Job Planner.
**Bryan.wagar**: Are you sharing us the Job Planner.
**Mparsons**: Screen or at least.
**Mparsons**: Oh, I'm sorry, you are right.
**Jdawson**: I'm.
**Mparsons**: On a different screen.
**Mparsons**: Right.
**Mparsons**: So once you have this, this page on Job Planner from the link that get distributed, it has two tabs.
**Mparsons**: So this one general has the information for the time, the link and people attending.
**Mparsons**: And down here I put a summary of what we talk about.
**Mparsons**: I attach that to this and on this end, we have the agenda of the different items that we talked about.
**Mparsons**: But if you want to have this as a PDF, you just click export and it downloads everything for you in a PDF format.
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay, okay, okay, okay.
**Bryan.wagar**: But it's same thing coming out from export button, right?
**Jdawson**: Correct.
**Bryan.wagar**: Like same thing written in here.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: And for.
**Mparsons**: For the daily reports, those are.
**Mparsons**: Those are internal.
**Mparsons**: I'm not able to add any.
**Mparsons**: Any.
**Mparsons**: Anyone outside of our company to.
**Mparsons**: To see those.
**Mparsons**: Those are for our guys only.
**Mparsons**: But whatever is put on the daily report at the end of the week.
**Mparsons**: That's what I summarize.
**Mparsons**: Everything I put.
**Mparsons**: I take everything from there and I put it on the weekly report that I send out.
**Kevin.ly**: So, Yasuke, we.
**Kevin.ly**: We can see the meeting minutes by hitting export.
**Jdawson**: And.
**Kevin.ly**: And that'll give you exactly what Keva's sharing right now on screen earlier on the PDF.
**Kevin.ly**: But when it comes to the daily report, he will issue it at the end of the week to you because we don't have access to that on their portal.
**Kevin.ly**: That's just for the internal aliato folks.
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay, Okay, I understand.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Kevin.ly**: But the schedule is also up there, so you should be able to see the schedule.
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay, I understand.
**Bryan.wagar**: The schedule also for the delivery date for material too.
**Bryan.wagar**: Not yet, no.
**Mparsons**: So usually the materials will be delivered would be brought in by the subcontractors.
**Mparsons**: This last delivery on Monday, that happened because they shipped it instead of bringing it in themselves.
**Mparsons**: And it was supposed to arrive on Tuesday, but it got there early.
**Mparsons**: So Tim sent his guys to have it offloaded, unloaded from the truck.
**Mparsons**: But usually.
**Mparsons**: And if going forward, if we have any shipment of material, we'll share that with you and share with Ted.
**Mparsons**: So that way you guys are aware that something is coming over.
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay.
**Bryan.wagar**: And I think subcontractors should not be there without Aliato, so.
**Jdawson**: Correct.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, that's also another concern.
**Bryan.wagar**: So please make sure that always Mike there when subcontractors on site.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Kevin.ly**: I think we can keep going.
**Mparsons**: Yeah, that's.
**Mparsons**: That's all I have for now.
**Mparsons**: I don't know if anyone else has something.
**Aelkarrimy**: Hey, look at.
**Aelkarrimy**: They.
**Aelkarrimy**: They built those bathrooms like over top of the doors too.
**Aelkarrimy**: It's interesting.
**Jdawson**: Wait, what?
**Kevin.ly**: Those loading doors are.
**Kevin.ly**: Oh my God.
**Bryan.wagar**: They are.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Wait, wait, wait.
**Kevin.ly**: Is the chase.
**Kevin.ly**: Is the toilet chase in between the two toilet rooms or is it up against the exterior wall?
**Aelkarrimy**: I think it's in between them.
**Bclymer**: But that would put your water closets on one of those walls with the dock doors though, wouldn't it?
**Kevin.ly**: I'm Just trying to imagine them opening up.
**Aelkarrimy**: They drill the hole through the dock leveler to set the toilets.
**Bclymer**: Or your lavatories are over there.
**Bclymer**: One of the two.
**Mparsons**: That's amazing.
**Aelkarrimy**: All right.
**Aelkarrimy**: The difference.
**Aelkarrimy**: If we put a panel in front of it.
**Aelkarrimy**: That's what I was asking.
**Aelkarrimy**: Like, is the door needed?
**Aelkarrimy**: Is it used that maybe they could set up a unistrut?
**Aelkarrimy**: Of course, I didn't think about the dock leveler.
**Aelkarrimy**: That big panel is gonna have to sit on something.
**Aelkarrimy**: So I don't know if that would be a problem or not.
**Aelkarrimy**: But you could put a strut system and support the panel off the wall or something.
**Kevin.ly**: I think.
**Kevin.ly**: I think keeping it on a wall is just cleaner.
**Kevin.ly**: And also for any changes that occurs within the warehouse, you know, it's planned for the.
**Kevin.ly**: I'm just worried about them demoing the restrooms down the line, which I don't think is going to happen.
**Kevin.ly**: But right now, I think what we have in the RFI is a good path forward.
**Kevin.ly**: But we just need confirmation for the duration.
**Kevin.ly**: Just so then we can get full approval from Yasuke that we can proceed with the installation per the schedule.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Kevin.ly**: So as soon as you guys have just the lead time and the installation time from Tim, let's get Ted involved right away so then he can give us the clearance to keep going.
**Bclymer**: Yusuke, were those restrooms built as part of the core shell of the original building?
**Bclymer**: Or was it a tenant fit out when the lease tenant came in?
**Bclymer**: Do you know for the right one?
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Bryan.wagar**: This.
**Bryan.wagar**: Right.
**Bryan.wagar**: Restroom poets.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yes, I think this is.
**Bschwartz**: I can answer it this way.
**Kevin.ly**: Yusuke and Joe, any updates?
**Kevin.ly**: Any good news for us this week?
**Kevin.ly**: Or are we still waiting till the 16th?
**Bschwartz**: Waiting, unfortunately.
**Jdawson**: Gotcha.
**Bschwartz**: They provided some good news Monday and Tuesday.
**Bschwartz**: I guess they're still trying to figure out some details.
**Bschwartz**: They're very optimistic that it's going to work, but I've heard that before, so I'm not getting my hopes up by any means.
**Bschwartz**: But it is.
**Bschwartz**: It is trending in the correct direction.
**Bschwartz**: The correct direction is the one with the least amount of changes.
**Aelkarrimy**: And Mike, if these.
**Aelkarrimy**: Like they bought these feeders to go from this panel to the main gear panel.
**Aelkarrimy**: So if there's anything left over, it's just going to be leftover wire.
**Aelkarrimy**: So why not have them start anyways?
**Aelkarrimy**: Just leave the extra wire hanging out.
**Aelkarrimy**: Wherever this panel goes, it looks like it's going to get closer.
**Aelkarrimy**: But at least then we can start getting these feeders installed and stay on schedule.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: That's.
**Aelkarrimy**: Finalize this.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: That's the plan.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: You're talking from the main switch, main electrical room to HE1, right?
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Mparsons**: So.
**Kevin.ly**: So Yusuke, HE1.
**Kevin.ly**: There's no issue with them proceeding with that, right?
**Kevin.ly**: Because it's outside of the fence area.
**Jdawson**: Is that.
**Bryan.wagar**: Is that outside of the fence for.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah.
**Kevin.ly**: It's from the beginning on the left side of this picture of this fence.
**Mparsons**: Ah, yeah, yeah.
**Bryan.wagar**: I understand your point, but was it from the original plan?
**Kevin.ly**: No original plan.
**Kevin.ly**: It was over there on the right side.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yes.
**Kevin.ly**: We have a loading dock door, so we're moving it to the left side instead.
**Kevin.ly**: And now it's in your area of work rather than the sub tenant.
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay, okay.
**Bryan.wagar**: So in the original plan, the 81.
**Mparsons**: Located right here.
**Bryan.wagar**: On the dock leveler.
**Mparsons**: Yeah.
**Kevin.ly**: Correct.
**Kevin.ly**: We didn't show that door.
**Kevin.ly**: We thought there were only three.
**Kevin.ly**: That was just an error on our drawings when we were cleaning it up.
**Mparsons**: So now it's coming right here.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I think.
**Kevin.ly**: No problem.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, we can do that.
**Jdawson**: Perfect.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bryan.wagar**: And sorry.
**Bryan.wagar**: Mike, how's it going for the confirmation with Ted about the.
**Bryan.wagar**: The area you're using for cabling?
**Bryan.wagar**: Pulling the wire from Powerhouse to our construction area?
**Bryan.wagar**: It's going okay or.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah, so we haven't.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: We haven't made it outside of our construction area yet.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: But I made sure that when.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: When we're about ready to be even heading outside of our gate way.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Well, before we get to the office area, that I'll make sure that Ted is involved and he's.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: He's in communication and make sure we stay on the same page.
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bryan.wagar**: And Ted have a image of.
**Bryan.wagar**: Of your work that will not make that aisle close off for in the operation.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Right?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I'm sorry, what is that?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: What are you saying?
**Bryan.wagar**: Like, like my.
**Bryan.wagar**: My only concern is that your work will not close off the aisles inside the operation and.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah, yeah, so that's what.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I will make sure that I'm in communication with Ted and then if, you know, if we.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: If possible, people can move around us, but if not, then we'll make sure that, you know, we.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: We get out of the way in certain time slots and make sure that we're not interrupting any operation.
**Mparsons**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bryan.wagar**: Mike, do you know like, what kind of like lifter you're going to use for the cabling work?
**Bryan.wagar**: At least.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Just a scissor lift.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Bryan.wagar**: Scissor lift.
**Bryan.wagar**: You can confirm and tell me later if you need a tab.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Reach out to me.
**Mparsons**: Anything else?
**Mparsons**: All right, we'll end it early.
**Mparsons**: If no one has anything else to Add.
**Bryan.wagar**: Oh, sorry.
**Bryan.wagar**: I think one thing I wanted to talk was Jesse and Joe.
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah, Jesse and Joe.
**Kevin.ly**: Do you guys mind just hanging back after this call?
**Aelkarrimy**: Sure, yeah, no problem.
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah, thank you guys.
**Kevin.ly**: But I think we're good guys to conclude.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: All right, thank you.
**Bclymer**: Thanks everyone.
**Mparsons**: Next week.
**Aelkarrimy**: I turned my camera on, but if I do, it like, screws up my video.
**Kevin.ly**: So, Jesse, I just had a quick question for you.
**Kevin.ly**: What?
**Jdawson**: What?
**Kevin.ly**: What's happening now?
**Kevin.ly**: As we're moving forward, we know that exotect's taking care of that change order that's relative to the.
**Kevin.ly**: The transformers and the electrical upgrade.
**Kevin.ly**: So when it comes to that change order, what Yusuke is trying to figure out is if Exotech can directly pay Aliato rather than Uniqlo paying Aliato.
**Aelkarrimy**: I mean, that.
**Aelkarrimy**: I guess.
**Aelkarrimy**: I don't know.
**Aelkarrimy**: Why not?
**Aelkarrimy**: I mean, Joe, like, would we just send you an invoice and you guys pay the invoice?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: We're.
**Kevin.ly**: We're willing.
**Bschwartz**: Whoever we need, whatever we need to do, we're going to take care of it.
**Bschwartz**: So I think that, I mean, however works for you, Alto.
**Bschwartz**: Whatever is best for y'.
**Bschwartz**: All.
**Aelkarrimy**: And then we'll just do a zero dollar change order and we'll submit it to Uniqlo saying, hey, this change was paid for by Exotech and it's zero cost to you.
**Aelkarrimy**: You just like that we can wrap it up and be done?
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah, just.
**Bschwartz**: And that just acknowledges that there is a change and you approve of it through the change order?
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah, we can do that.
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay, so that's clear.
**Bryan.wagar**: And oil separator is on our side, so.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, for electrical, you can directly request exotic to pay an oil separator for us.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay, Yep, that'll work.
**Aelkarrimy**: I'll get Kevin to modify that and then Joe, you just tell us who you want us to send that to or.
**Aelkarrimy**: I guess we haven't figured out what.
**Bschwartz**: We'Re doing yet, but we're still waiting.
**Bschwartz**: But yeah, hopefully that'll.
**Bschwartz**: We'll have that discussion by next Wednesday.
**Jdawson**: Okay, good.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, we're good.
**Bschwartz**: Sounds good.
**Bschwartz**: Yuzuka, do you have anything that you wanted to discuss with me after this or.
**Bryan.wagar**: No, you can just stay here.
**Jdawson**: Okay, that's fine.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay, well, I'm gonna fall out.
**Aelkarrimy**: I'm gonna kill this fireflies.
**Aelkarrimy**: Unless you wanted to take notes.
**Bschwartz**: No, go ahead, shut them down.
