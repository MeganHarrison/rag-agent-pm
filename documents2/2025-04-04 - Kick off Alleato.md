**Mcalcetero**: So not sure.
**Mcalcetero**: He was in a groundbreaking event this morning.
**Mcalcetero**: So not sure.
**Mcalcetero**: He told me just to, you know, just go to, you know, just take it for him in case he joins.
**Mcalcetero**: He will join.
**Mcalcetero**: Otherwise, we'll have the Fireflies recap just in case.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: Excellent.
**Fnjie**: No worries.
**Fnjie**: All right.
**Fnjie**: Justin or Fatima, is it okay if we get started?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Ealnaslah**: Yep.
**Fnjie**: Perfect.
**Fnjie**: So, again, thanks for referring the opportunity to us.
**Fnjie**: Obviously, there's a huge push to get this out the door as soon as possible, and we're all on board to finish this as soon as.
**Fnjie**: As soon as practical.
**Fnjie**: And in order to do that, we've sent out the.
**Fnjie**: The smartsheet.
**Fnjie**: Were you guys able to access that just fine?
**Ealnaslah**: Yeah.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: And.
**Fnjie**: Or did you see how you like, you can upload documents, and if you want, there's a feature where you can do a comment.
**Fnjie**: If you tag somebody, like, at Adrian, we'll get an email notification or we can see it when we get on there.
**Ealnaslah**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: And we can do the same for you guys.
**Fnjie**: And so.
**Fnjie**: Okay, so everything here in purple.
**Fnjie**: And I can share my screen.
**Fnjie**: I know, Justin, you're traveling, so don't, don't look at your phone.
**Bclymer**: Okay, I can, I'm at a coffee shop at the moment, so I'll be okay.
**Fnjie**: Oh, okay.
**Fnjie**: Oh, then you can look at your phone all you want.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah, just on my laptop, unfortunately.
**Fnjie**: Sounds good.
**Fnjie**: So this is, let me see.
**Fnjie**: Yep.
**Fnjie**: Can you guys all see my screen just fine?
**Ealnaslah**: Yeah.
**Fnjie**: All right, so real quick, so you click on the paperclip, which you've already said you, you're good with.
**Fnjie**: You click on this little comment thing right here.
**Fnjie**: A little panel shows up here at the right.
**Fnjie**: And if you, if I want to send a, or a little notification to you, I type in your name or your email and then I say, you know, the, the message, I click enter and you know, you'll get an email notification if you know, for things that are urgent that you want to let us know.
**Fnjie**: Obviously you can just send an email directly or you can just bring our attention to it here.
**Fnjie**: Anyway.
**Fnjie**: Okay, I'll just delete this for now.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: So everything here in purple I have as a priority, I've labeled as a priority.
**Fnjie**: And the reason for that is one, it obviously are, they're the accounts that are going to take us a little bit more time to audit.
**Fnjie**: AR revenue being the biggest ones.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: The whip schedule, the under over billings and all that good stuff.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: And those are also the areas where we're going to be making selections.
**Fnjie**: So revenue and, and contracts and all that obviously is going to take time for you guys to pull.
**Fnjie**: So, so we want to make sure that is provided to us as soon as practical.
**Fnjie**: Right.
**Fnjie**: So we can make the selections.
**Fnjie**: We can send confirmations as well.
**Fnjie**: So AR confirmations will need, those will go out to the various clients of the company or the customers.
**Fnjie**: And depending on what their turnaround time, that also can be, you know, it could be quick, it could be the same day, next day, or sometimes we gotta follow up a few times to, to get that information.
**Fnjie**: And so those are again, those are everything that I've labeled priority.
**Fnjie**: Other areas that we're going to do confirmations for is cash, the bank accounts and the debt or the line of credit accounts.
**Fnjie**: What I understand from Brandon is it's not only just the Forum Credit union, but it is the, the Chase bank account.
**Fnjie**: So if we can get, you know, like I have here under this priority list, a list of all the accounts with full account numbers, we'll confirm that through confirmation.com.
**Fnjie**: you know, that usually takes a day or two.
**Fnjie**: I'm not too worried about cash accounts I don't know if Forum Credit Union is on is in network to do electronic.
**Fnjie**: If not, we'll have to send traditional emails.
**Fnjie**: It takes a little bit more time and then yeah, Chase bank is going to be just fine.
**Fnjie**: So if I can get a list of all the bank accounts, bank number or account numbers, who's the authorizer?
**Fnjie**: I'm assuming it's all going to be Brandon, but let me know if it's somebody else and that way we can send it out asap.
**Fnjie**: So that's a high level overview, but go ahead and we can talk about anything further.
**Bclymer**: You have any questions?
**Ealnaslah**: No, I don't.
**Ealnaslah**: I will get those out to you.
**Fnjie**: Perfect.
**Bclymer**: When are we thinking my Fatima is there gonna need anything on the, Are you going to need anything on the Aliato side in order to get the purple stuff out?
**Ealnaslah**: I don't think so.
**Ealnaslah**: I have already sent the list to kind of to Jose to kind of help me get as much of that information.
**Ealnaslah**: Jose is the new accountant on the, on the Aliado side.
**Ealnaslah**: So I'm hoping to be able to get that to you either this, this weekend or by Monday.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: Yeah, perfect.
**Fnjie**: Perfect.
**Fnjie**: Yeah.
**Fnjie**: As, as soon as practical.
**Fnjie**: Obviously I don't.
**Fnjie**: We're not usually the ones to press but obviously Brandon, you know, is super sensitive about, about this.
**Fnjie**: So we want to make sure he's, he's happy we get this audit done asap.
**Fnjie**: Adrian, did you want to talk about anything?
**Justin**: So typically we put due dates on some of our smartsheets.
**Justin**: So now the timing wise do we know exactly when we want to complete?
**Justin**: I know that it was on May 1st, so we are targeting that May 1st date.
**Fnjie**: Yeah.
**Fnjie**: So I talked to Brandon yesterday and I said basically once we start receiving the PVCs, that's when the, the clock starts if you will.
**Fnjie**: So.
**Fnjie**: So Justin and Fatima, sorry, no pressure, but somewhat pressure.
**Fnjie**: If you can get that information to us as soon as possible, say you know, Monday the, the 7th, then we'll target, we'll target early maybe for, for issuance.
**Fnjie**: So like the week of the 5th through the 9th is probably what we'll target for a four week turnaround.
**Fnjie**: But we'll need that information in order to kind of start the clock if you will.
**Fnjie**: So Adrian can put in some, some time, some due dates or Fatima, if you want to put in the dates that you think you're going to get all these by.
**Fnjie**: I'm sure you said Monday, but if there's anything that's coming Tuesday, Wednesday that would be helpful.
**Ealnaslah**: Yeah, I can, I can Get I, I'm gonna try to get the high priority stuff to you by, by end of day Monday because you know, as you know it's month end and we have other, you know, other deadlines that I will be working on.
**Ealnaslah**: But I will do my best to get the high priority stuff to you by the end of day Monday.
**Fnjie**: Okay, excellent.
**Fnjie**: That would be much appreciated.
**Fnjie**: Yeah, I mean it probably goes without saying once you upload like an AR aging or the WIP schedule, if you can make sure everything kind of ties back to the trial balance, that would be helpful.
**Fnjie**: So that way we don't have to lose a day trying to get the right schedule that ties.
**Justin**: And now that we know that approximately like on the Monday we do have automations in the smartsheet, do we want to start doing automations ion kind of like when it changes past the due dates, then it turns it overdue and then kind of like a friendly reminder email for certain items with that.
**Fnjie**: Yeah, we can.
**Fnjie**: We obviously, I mean everything is due asap to be honest with you.
**Fnjie**: So if we want to say Monday, but then you know, they get a notification, I'm sure Fatima and Justin know that it's, it's going to be due once we ask for it, which is you know, early, early next week if you will.
**Fnjie**: So we can't Adrian until Monday end.
**Bclymer**: Of day and then you can kick our butt if things aren't there.
**Bclymer**: We'll start there.
**Bclymer**: But yeah, I think priority list end of day and then early next week and we'll kind of work on everything else faster than we can.
**Justin**: Okay, I'll put some, some dates on the 7th then and maybe the end of that week for the rest of the items.
**Justin**: Sure, let me know.
**Justin**: Yeah, and then let us know if things change or things are not.
**Justin**: You're not able to provide stuff at earlier date or so.
**Bclymer**: Alrighty.
**Bclymer**: All right guys, I gotta slip out right now, but I think we got the things here.
**Bclymer**: Fatima, Monday and the day is kind of our target.
**Bclymer**: If we do it before that, great.
**Bclymer**: But will aim to get the high priority and then everything else trickled in next week if possible.
**Fnjie**: Okay, sounds good.
**Fnjie**: Thanks Justin.
**Fnjie**: Appreciate it.
**Fnjie**: Take care.
**Fnjie**: All right, so I talked a little bit about AR in cash and revenue.
**Fnjie**: Let's see what else is on here.
**Fnjie**: Line of credit.
**Justin**: And then I guess for like the nature of the company, what type of it they use or kind of construction software they use.
**Justin**: Who would be the best person to reach out to getting that understanding of kind of like the nature of the, of the company.
**Justin**: Their history and all that.
**Justin**: Intern control items as well.
**Ealnaslah**: That will be either Brandon or Jesse.
**Ealnaslah**: I would say Brandon.
**Ealnaslah**: Yes.
**Mcalcetero**: I agree.
**Mcalcetero**: Brandon will be the best.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Justin**: So he'll be the best person to kind of like, if there's an organization chart, how many employees there are.
**Justin**: Because I just want to know.
**Mcalcetero**: We do have one.
**Mcalcetero**: We do have organizations.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, we can share that with you.
**Justin**: Because there might be some item requests in the smartsheet that.
**Justin**: Because typically what we do is we put specific names on the smartsheet for who is responsible to provide certain things.
**Justin**: So I know there's some items that it's like a background about the company articles, incorporation, or those items.
**Justin**: I'm assuming then Brian, or would it be yourself, Maria, to provide those items?
**Mcalcetero**: So if you can put both of us, Brandon and Maria, because usually Brandon, what he will do is just send them to me, and then I'll just upload them.
**Mcalcetero**: So I will be just nudging him in terms of like, hey, I need this right now.
**Mcalcetero**: Just send it.
**Mcalcetero**: Or if we don't have it, I'll create it right away.
**Mcalcetero**: For example, the organizational chart, we didn't have one, and we just created one just, like, from yesterday.
**Mcalcetero**: So things like that.
**Mcalcetero**: So if you can put the both of us, if he can provide, he will send to me, and then I'll upload them to the file.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Justin**: Yeah, we can do that.
**Justin**: We can set parties on, I'm assuming, just like, business and company information for our documentation and more so accounting and schedules.
**Justin**: It's more so Plum.
**Ealnaslah**: Yes.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Justin**: All right.
**Justin**: We can definitely do that in the smartsheet and identify the responsible parties.
**Ealnaslah**: Yep.
**Justin**: And one thing is this is just a kind of like a smartsheet that we set up based on kind of like our initial understanding of the company.
**Justin**: So the smartsheet might change as the audit progresses.
**Ealnaslah**: Okay.
**Justin**: But we'll let you know if things change.
**Justin**: We'll put, like, a date as well when the line changes happen, so there won't be any surprises or, hey, we're adding this stuff, right?
**Justin**: And you don't know.
**Justin**: We'll let you guys know.
**Ealnaslah**: All right, Sounds good.
**Justin**: All right, my initial questions for now for go for us to get started.
**Fnjie**: Perfect.
**Fnjie**: All right.
**Fnjie**: Thank you, Fatima.
**Fnjie**: Thank you, Maria.
**Mcalcetero**: Of course.
**Ealnaslah**: Thank you, guys.
**Fnjie**: Enjoy the rest of your day and the weekend.
**Fnjie**: We'll hopefully talk on Monday.
**Fnjie**: Thank you so much.
**Mcalcetero**: Happy.

**Justin**: Bye.
