**Rthompson**: Where's Zach Copeland from?
**Zach**: What's that?
**Rthompson**: Zach Copeland.
**Rthompson**: Where's he from?
**Zach**: Justin Dorsey Plumbing.
**Zach**: Okay.
**Zach**: Why?
**Rthompson**: I just see him on the invited list.
**Zach**: What's that?
**Zach**: De.
**Rthompson**: Should probably be on here at some point, maybe starting next week.
**Rthompson**: Yeah, see how this goes with the center point this week, but.
**Zach**: Well, I think that's probably about all that's going to jump on here.
**Zach**: Morning, Tim.
**Ikaase**: Morning.
**Ikaase**: How are you?
**Zach**: Good.
**Zach**: All ag peers are done building pads, ready to go.
**Zach**: What do you want me to have the surveyor stake out?
**Zach**: Because I'm gonna have that staked out on Thursday.
**Zach**: That way you guys can verify and you're good to go.
**Ikaase**: Kagan was supposed to send him something over.
**Brhoades**: Did it.
**Ikaase**: Has that not happened?
**Zach**: Not that I saw.
**Ikaase**: Okay, we'll get that over today.
**Zach**: Yeah, that way I can get the surveyor scheduled to be out here Thursday morning.
**Ikaase**: Yes, sir.
**Ikaase**: I'll make sure you have that today.
**Zach**: Then you still have rebar coming Friday?
**Ikaase**: I believe so.
**Ikaase**: There's some emails going back and forth, but that sounds accurate.
**Zach**: Okay.
**Zach**: You want to do me a favor?
**Zach**: After this call, just check in on that and get me a confirmed date.
**Ikaase**: Yes, I will do that.
**Zach**: Oh, let's see what else is starting over.
**Zach**: So you guys got that?
**Zach**: Washout's already on site for you.
**Zach**: You guys have all your own layout after we give you whatever you're asking for, correct?
**Rthompson**: Yes, sir.
**Zach**: Okay, so ag peers are done, and then for Ryan, we're waiting on Center Point Energy still for you.
**Zach**: So once Center Point's done, how long will it take you to get the water and the gas or the water line?
**Zach**: In.
**Cmcdaniel**: Two weeks probably last probably a week and a half.
**Cmcdaniel**: There's a.
**Cmcdaniel**: We do still need to cut out the middle of the 8 inches out of that volleyball side of the building.
**Cmcdaniel**: So I don't know when you do that.
**Zach**: Hold on, let me look at something.
**Zach**: Because.
**Zach**: Yeah, so if we do that, Ryan, we're gonna have to at least leave a, you know, a footprint around the outside of the building so Merrick can set level with their.
**Zach**: With their mini when they dig.
**Cmcdaniel**: I would assume we want to get it out before they do.
**Zach**: Footers be easier.
**Zach**: Yeah.
**Cmcdaniel**: Yeah.
**Zach**: So they're going to start down on the west end on Monday morning.
**Cmcdaniel**: On Monday morning?
**Zach**: Yeah.
**Zach**: With footers?
**Cmcdaniel**: Yeah.
**Cmcdaniel**: When.
**Cmcdaniel**: When will they get to the east side?
**Zach**: What do you think?
**Rthompson**: You guys still got to pour the tie beams across north to south in the volleyball.
**Rthompson**: We want to bang for those where we excavate the dirt out of there.
**Zach**: Yeah, but, Glenn, those are down.
**Zach**: Yeah, Those are.
**Zach**: Remember, those are minus 18.
**Zach**: Top of those are good.
**Ikaase**: Probably won't be down there till Wednesday.
**Ikaase**: I'm guessing we're probably gonna do pads and stuff too.
**Ikaase**: So.
**Cmcdaniel**: Then do you guys want a price per load on that dirt?
**Cmcdaniel**: Or how do you.
**Cmcdaniel**: Or you can get with me afterwards how you want to handle all that extra dirt?
**Zach**: Yeah, see, Merit's going to start down here on this end.
**Zach**: So they'll have at least what, three, four days probably.
**Zach**: Tim.
**Ikaase**: Yeah.
**Zach**: How many days do you think you're going to need down there, Ryan?
**Cmcdaniel**: For what?
**Cmcdaniel**: Getting that dirt out of there?
**Zach**: Yeah.
**Cmcdaniel**: Probably day and a half.
**Zach**: So you really only have.
**Zach**: You really only had the water line left out here to install sanitary.
**Zach**: You're up to the building, right?
**Cmcdaniel**: Correct.
**Zach**: Roof drains.
**Zach**: Roof drains and then parking lot finish.
**Cmcdaniel**: How's that proof roll?
**Zach**: Like yesterday, it actually didn't do bad, dude, at all.
**Zach**: He drove right out there and I just.
**Zach**: I just had him just drive around and.
**Zach**: Yeah, it was hell.
**Zach**: It looked awesome.
**Zach**: I was like, holy crap.
**Cmcdaniel**: That's what Levi was saying.
**Cmcdaniel**: It looked pretty good when he was rolling around on a loader.
**Brhoades**: Yeah.
**Zach**: So.
**Zach**: Yeah.
**Zach**: So, I mean, do you have Levi gone somewhere else today?
**Cmcdaniel**: As of a little bit ago, he was staying there today.
**Cmcdaniel**: Okay, I know.
**Zach**: He's saying he's needing death fluid in the dozer.
**Zach**: Tell him Andrew wants his sunglasses back.
**Zach**: All right.
**Zach**: Waterline dirt removal.
**Cmcdaniel**: You can all wizk out there for an official proof roll or.
**Cmcdaniel**: What's the plan there?
**Zach**: Yeah, yeah.
**Zach**: Once she's saved, once you feel like we've got enough area that you're good to go, we'll get them to come out and do one and we'll go from there.
**Cmcdaniel**: Good.
**Zach**: Because after we do that proofful, you guys will want to drop back and do your under drains, your spider drains, won't you?
**Cmcdaniel**: As soon as it passes.
**Cmcdaniel**: Yes.
**Zach**: Yeah, that's what I.
**Zach**: That's what I was assuming that's how you'd want to do it.
**Cmcdaniel**: As soon as it passes.
**Cmcdaniel**: And we get all our list done if muster needed.
**Ikaase**: Okay.
**Zach**: And then where do you want Merit to stockpile stoils?
**Zach**: It spoils that for you from the building.
**Zach**: From all those column pads.
**Cmcdaniel**: Let me.
**Cmcdaniel**: Let me look at and I'll get back to you on that.
**Zach**: Okay.
**Zach**: Can you get me an answer by the end of tomorrow?
**Cmcdaniel**: Yeah, I'll get you one today.
**Zach**: Okay.
**Zach**: All right.
**Cmcdaniel**: How much walls are you anticipating?
**Cmcdaniel**: Any idea?
**Cmcdaniel**: Probably 500 yards.
**Cmcdaniel**: Thousand.
**Cmcdaniel**: We're in there.
**Zach**: Kagan.
**Ikaase**: Cam, you probably have to go.
**Brhoades**: That's a good answer.
**Ikaase**: Yeah, I have no idea.
**Ikaase**: We'd have to go pull up what we had estimated.
**Zach**: And then.
**Zach**: Ryan, do you want to start getting some of this topsoil out of here before we.
**Cmcdaniel**: Yes, I do.
**Zach**: Yeah.
**Zach**: Okay.
**Zach**: When are you looking to do that?
**Cmcdaniel**: Soon.
**Zach**: Good answer.
**Zach**: How about a day?
**Cmcdaniel**: Yeah, maybe.
**Cmcdaniel**: There's a lot more tops rolling we originally anticipated, so.
**Zach**: Oh, no, I know.
**Zach**: Which.
**Zach**: Remember that one guy that Bart said he would.
**Zach**: He said that guy would probably take it for free.
**Cmcdaniel**: You have that guy's number?
**Zach**: I do not.
**Zach**: As soon as I see Bart today, I'll get Bart to give it to us so that way we can get a hold of him and see what kind of deal you can make with that dude.
**Zach**: So you think you're gonna start exporting topsoil this week?
**Cmcdaniel**: That's the plan, if I just need to find a home and work it out with you guys.
**Cmcdaniel**: So.
**Zach**: Take it to Andrew's apartment.
**Zach**: Just stock it there.
**Cmcdaniel**: Perfect.
**Cmcdaniel**: Put it in my garage, send me an address.
**Cmcdaniel**: I'll be there.
**Zach**: All right, Merritt.
**Zach**: You guys need anything from Alito?
**Ikaase**: Hey, Kegan, now that you're on, is the rebar schedule to be there Friday?
**Brhoades**: I'm still waiting on an answer from Bryce on if he's gonna have it there Friday or Monday.
**Brhoades**: I know they have their.
**Brhoades**: We released footings before we released the grade beam that goes around the perimeter.
**Zach**: So I just need to get dates.
**Brhoades**: From him confirmed today, which I have a follow up with him here after this call to confirm that.
**Ikaase**: All right, shoot me a text as.
**Zach**: Soon as you do.
**Brhoades**: Yeah, I can shoot you over something.
**Ikaase**: D.
**Ikaase**: And then the other thing.
**Ikaase**: We're going to get them over a file today, what we want laid out, correct?
**Brhoades**: Yep.
**Brhoades**: At 10:30 I'm meeting with Dave and Abby, and we're going over that, and then we'll shoot it over to.
**Brhoades**: We're going to have Miller do it for us since they're already out there and familiar with the project.
**Brhoades**: So we'll shoot that over to them today and get on their schedule for it.
**Ikaase**: Sounds like Chad's got them set up for Thursday already.
**Ikaase**: Kegan, just FYI.
**Zach**: They were out here yesterday.
**Zach**: Kagan and Adam.
**Zach**: Adam with Miller.
**Zach**: He's going on vacation next week, so he said.
**Zach**: Actually, he's on vacation Friday as well, so he said to make sure we get him out here by Thursday morning.
**Brhoades**: Okay.
**Brhoades**: Yeah, I should have filed by the end of the day today to shoot over to him.
**Brhoades**: I reached out to them last week about it.
**Zach**: Yes.
**Brhoades**: I can't remember Who?
**Brhoades**: I think it was Nathan I talked to.
**Zach**: Yeah, Nathan.
**Zach**: Although.
**Brhoades**: Yeah.
**Brhoades**: Yep.
**Brhoades**: So I'll follow back up with him today.
**Zach**: All right.
**Zach**: And then, Ryan, you don't need any sleeves for through the footings or anything, do you?
**Zach**: Or any of your lines for me?
**Zach**: Yeah.
**Cmcdaniel**: No.
**Zach**: And then the only other thing for merit is don't forget, we got to do the two pieces of rebar 20 foot apart for the electricians.
**Cmcdaniel**: You're a lot.
**Cmcdaniel**: Yeah, your electrician did ask for that.
**Cmcdaniel**: What depth you want to put that in?
**Zach**: Let me ask Brennan on that.
**Cmcdaniel**: Check again.
**Cmcdaniel**: I don't want to say.
**Zach**: I think you said a 1 inch, but I lost depth and diameter of pipe.
**Zach**: And that was going from where to where, Ryan, do you remember was going from, like the.
**Cmcdaniel**: He just said, get it in the building.
**Zach**: It goes from the PIV valve to the building.
**Cmcdaniel**: Wait, what?
**Cmcdaniel**: Yes, PIV and just get it in the building is what he said.
**Zach**: Okay, I'll follow up with Dean this morning on that, Ryan, and have you an answer, hopefully by lunchtime.
**Cmcdaniel**: Yeah.
**Zach**: Anything else?
**Ikaase**: All good.
**Ikaase**: On our end.
**Zach**: When?
**Rthompson**: Yes.
**Zach**: Anything from you?
**Rthompson**: No, not for this.
