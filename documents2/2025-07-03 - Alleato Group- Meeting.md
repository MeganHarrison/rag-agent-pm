**Philip**: I can hear you now.
**Mike**: Great.
**Bclymer**: How goes it?
**Mike**: Good.
**Fknapp**: How's the trip?
**Mike**: Good, man.
**Bclymer**: I walked about 30 miles today around, you know, the Coliseum and Vatican, everything.
**Bclymer**: But it's, it's just amazing.
**Bclymer**: Even though, you know, the sheer size is just amazing.
**Fknapp**: Is that your first time in Italy?
**Bclymer**: No, I was here in 2016.
**Bclymer**: I came and I went to Rome and Venice and Florence and everything.
**Bclymer**: And then I in Pompeii and a few other places.
**Bclymer**: But I just wanted to stop by here because, you know, a couple of my friends hadn't seen it.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, exactly.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Fknapp**: So in Croatia there are worse places to revisit.
**Bclymer**: I know, right?
**Jmeltzner**: Hey, guys.
**Fknapp**: Hey, Frederick.
**Mike**: How are you doing?
**Jmeltzner**: Great.
**Jmeltzner**: Yourself?
**Fknapp**: Oh, not too bad.
**Bclymer**: Check it out.
**Jmeltzner**: None of us are as good as Brandon, though.
**Mike**: I know.
**Mike**: This is my hotel room.
**Fknapp**: Look at this guy.
**Mike**: There you go.
**Fknapp**: That's a green screen if I've ever seen one.
**Fknapp**: Come on.
**Mike**: Yeah, right.
**Fknapp**: You're an indie.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah, exactly.
**Mike**: Cool.
**Bclymer**: Well, nice to meet you.
**Bclymer**: So, Frederick.
**Bclymer**: I know we talk.
**Bclymer**: So this is Phil and Mike, you know, two of two of the partners.
**Bclymer**: We all work together, we all have our expertise and kind of what we do.
**Bclymer**: So I wanted to make sure we brought them in and you know, I've updated them on kind of the project and it looks like we have some possibilities to try to knock something out here.
**Mike**: Yeah, yeah, you know, we're, we're a.
**Jmeltzner**: Good part for us with Sandy Point.
**Jmeltzner**: So we have three large projects going on right now and 900 acres up in the Greater Toronto Area, 1800 acres in just south of D.C. and then, you know, here in North Carolina, 930.
**Mike**: And so, you know, on, on North.
**Jmeltzner**: Carolina we can capitalize in a, in a bunch of different ways.
**Jmeltzner**: We could join together in the macro or we could join together in the micro.
**Jmeltzner**: You know, I think it's all, all, all about the process and, and kind of what, what y' all are good at and have an.
**Jmeltzner**: You know, so for us in North Carolina.
**Mike**: Our lands really divided into two.
**Jmeltzner**: Separate 400 acre parcels.
**Jmeltzner**: First one, our phase one is 650 single family homes.
**Jmeltzner**: I'm not a single family home builder.
**Jmeltzner**: Do more City development, Virginia, for example, we have 9,000 units of multifamily 6 million square feet of commercial space.
**Jmeltzner**: You know, new train station for the Acela in greater Toronto area.
**Jmeltzner**: We have two casino licenses and four and a half million square feet of commercial space and 750 million square feet of data centers.
**Mike**: You know, here we you know, we.
**Jmeltzner**: We love the land, we love the area, we love the 1.7 miles of, of waterfront on, on the sound.
**Jmeltzner**: We love the 250 acre championship golf course, you know, and things that go along next to it, the hotel and, and other stuff.
**Jmeltzner**: We have entitlements you can't replace.
**Jmeltzner**: Today we have about 125 homes that could house a 20 foot cantilevered over the harbor dock deck.
**Jmeltzner**: Under that being your dock, you could park your 20 foot to 24 foot boat under your house.
**Jmeltzner**: You can't replicate those, those entitlements.
**Jmeltzner**: So it's entitled for 1900 Homes Golf form entitlement on commercial and retail and hotel which means we could build as much as we want in ops on the land.
**Jmeltzner**: We're never going to build 1900 homes.
**Jmeltzner**: And you know, in that sector we're going to strategically do 650.
**Mike**: So I'm, you know, if you guys.
**Jmeltzner**: Have a specific interest, if you have a design build, if you're, you know, if you say hey, I don't, don't really want somebody in the development world and I'd love to do you know, 200 to homes or I'd love to do the 256 BTR that are there, you know, or I'd love to partner with you on the golf.
**Jmeltzner**: I, I'm, I'm open for it.
**Jmeltzner**: You want to say, hey Fred, I'd like to take you out then, you know, and go do your design build.
**Jmeltzner**: Then let's talk about 40 or 50 million, not 8 million.
**Mike**: So I, I'm, I'm, I'm kind of.
**Jmeltzner**: Open primarily because I got two other massive projects to attend to as well.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, sounds like it.
**Bclymer**: I mean, yeah, I think we're, we're kind of open as well.
**Bclymer**: Our, our biggest thing was, you know, we, we were thinking we'd come in and you know, fund it all and, and we didn't you know, necessarily say like oh hey, we're going to try to push you out.
**Bclymer**: I think that, you know, we're always looking for other team members and people to learn from and, and do business with.
**Bclymer**: But yeah, I mean that's, that's definitely something.
**Bclymer**: If you're interested, we could partner in.
**Bclymer**: You know, I like to love it.
**Jmeltzner**: There's more than enough to go around.
**Jmeltzner**: We're negotiating a $10 billion senior debt facility right now that know we'll build it.
**Jmeltzner**: Our, our capital inquiries are around bridge.
**Jmeltzner**: I love being a part of a bunch of things versus being all of one thing.
**Fknapp**: So I get that.
**Fknapp**: So if everything you got going on here, Frederick, is there an area that we could come in and be the most help to you?
**Fknapp**: Like, what's the biggest thorn in your side right now that could maybe expedite things or make things move a little smoothly?
**Fknapp**: More smoothly.
**Mike**: Yeah.
**Mike**: So I think this is like, this.
**Jmeltzner**: Is my first intro to you.
**Mike**: You know, I, you knew better.
**Jmeltzner**: Your kind of sweet spot, you know.
**Mike**: If it's a, you know, if it's.
**Jmeltzner**: A capital and a, an advisory.
**Jmeltzner**: If it's a, you know, it's a, if it's a piece of running capital and you want to do, design, build on the single family homes, you want to take the 605th, you want to bring some capital in and take the 650 homes and, and say I can partner with five or six people to do that.
**Mike**: I'm great with that.
**Jmeltzner**: I'm not a home builder.
**Mike**: My experience is I was part of.
**Jmeltzner**: New Song Do City in South Korea, ground up development larger than Boston or Chicago.
**Jmeltzner**: I opened GlaxoSmithKline's global headquarters in, in London.
**Jmeltzner**: I restructured BBC's critical infrastructure.
**Jmeltzner**: And I was executive director of hudson yards for 10 years.
**Jmeltzner**: I want to build cities.
**Jmeltzner**: I don't want to build 650 homes.
**Mike**: I love it.
**Jmeltzner**: It's going to generate a ton of cash, especially in this area on the water.
**Mike**: I, I think it's going to be.
**Jmeltzner**: Incredibly fun to do.
**Jmeltzner**: I love assembling the land.
**Jmeltzner**: I love going through the master plan.
**Mike**: You'll have an expertise like, let me.
**Jmeltzner**: Know where it is and, and I'm game.
**Jmeltzner**: We've got in our group as well, so.
**Fknapp**: Hey, Joel.
**Mike**: Hey, guys.
**Mike**: Sorry about that.
**Fknapp**: I had a little trouble getting in.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I mean, we, we obviously, like, we don't just do residential.
**Mike**: Right.
**Bclymer**: We're not necessarily residential builders at all.
**Bclymer**: Like, that's, you know, one piece, but like, you know, we've got a very similar project down in Florida and it's got a residential piece, commercial piece, golf course, you know, hotels as well.
**Bclymer**: So we're, we're, I think we're aligned on that.
**Bclymer**: You know, as far as what that would be.
**Bclymer**: I mean, is, is.
**Bclymer**: Is it just you want to split off the houses or the entire thing?
**Bclymer**: You know, a partnership, what you'd be looking at.
**Mike**: No, you know, if you want to, you know, if you want to come.
**Jmeltzner**: Into the, the overall equity stack and, and, you know, on the overall project and, and be a part of the whole.
**Jmeltzner**: I'm, I'm open to that term sheet.
**Mike**: You know, if you Want to come.
**Jmeltzner**: In and, and run your program and subordinate, you know, subordinate us, given the other two projects.
**Jmeltzner**: I'm open for that as well.
**Mike**: Right.
**Jmeltzner**: That's just a, you know, it's just a number and it's a, you know, it's a, you know, it's a structure.
**Mike**: So I'm, I'm, I'm game to under.
**Jmeltzner**: You know, I'm game to understanding.
**Mike**: You know, what you guys would like and.
**Jmeltzner**: Then going down that route.
**Bclymer**: So, I mean, what we've talked about and kicked around is, is coming in, you know, as a, as an equity piece, as the majority equity piece and, you know, coming and knocking the whole thing down, bringing in the funding probably speed up the phasing a little bit compared to what you guys are currently showing, I think.
**Bclymer**: But that's, that's what we've kicked around.
**Bclymer**: And, and so knowing that you guys are, are open to that is, is beneficial because again, like you said, it just comes down to percentages.
**Mike**: Yeah.
**Mike**: Yeah.
**Mike**: Listen, if you, you know, if you're.
**Jmeltzner**: Talking 20, 25 million to come in, take the majority share, we could say in on the, on the back end and work through it.
**Mike**: You know, we pick the right number.
**Jmeltzner**: And pick the right structure and you know, pick the right, right engagement.
**Jmeltzner**: I would entertain it.
**Mike**: I don't want to lose it.
**Jmeltzner**: We tell everybody in our group love the process, not the project.
**Jmeltzner**: We really love the fundamentals of the, of the project.
**Jmeltzner**: We've, you know, we've got a bunch of the city relationships.
**Jmeltzner**: I brought into my group the guy who originally did the land acquisition 15, 15 years ago.
**Jmeltzner**: So we, you know, there's, there's a bunch to it.
**Jmeltzner**: So we want to do.
**Mike**: The.
**Jmeltzner**: Couple people in our group desperately want to do the project.
**Jmeltzner**: Well, we, we've, we've got two other major projects that, that are equally as interesting and so, you know, kind of.
**Mike**: Happy to work through.
**Jmeltzner**: You know, comes down to is what, what is the number and what is the structure?
**Mike**: And you know.
**Jmeltzner**: If you want to bat that around, I'm game.
**Philip**: What, where are you guys at right now?
**Philip**: Brandon, when he first approached us, they mentioned there's some kind of a deadline that was in the near term that just give me some understanding of what, what process you're at right now.
**Mike**: Yeah, we were, you know, I think.
**Jmeltzner**: We'Re the conversation oriented.
**Jmeltzner**: We were just looking for the piece of bridge capital between, you know, for the next 12 months between our senior debt facility that we're looking to close over the next next 90 days.
**Jmeltzner**: And we're we're collateralizing the three projects into that senior debt facility, which, which will be a $10 billion debt facility to build it all as quickly as we could, you know, digest it as quickly as we can.
**Jmeltzner**: So we're, we're tying up or we're closing here on the 15 between the 15th and the 20th.
**Jmeltzner**: And then it's, you know, then it's ours.
**Mike**: Okay.
**Fknapp**: Sounds like maybe Frederick the ball is really in our court to draft a term sheet for you and get it in front of you and see if it makes sense.
**Mike**: Yeah, I like, I'm okay.
**Jmeltzner**: You want to shoot an email over and jump back on the phone what you have?
**Mike**: You know, I think, you know, you.
**Jmeltzner**: Guys have the NDA.
**Jmeltzner**: It's a mutual NDA.
**Jmeltzner**: It's, you know, pretty easy.
**Jmeltzner**: But I would say if you're interested, execute it.
**Mike**: I'm happy, I'm happy if you want to jump, you know, drop five, ten.
**Jmeltzner**: Bullet points on an email.
**Jmeltzner**: Let's just go talk about it.
**Fknapp**: Yeah, yeah.
**Mike**: You know, we, I get we live.
**Jmeltzner**: In a term sheet world, but let's.
**Mike**: Talk about what it is and build.
**Jmeltzner**: It all together and move from there.
**Fknapp**: No, that makes sense.
**Fknapp**: Much rather work that way.
**Mike**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And, and on the, on the debt structure, like, because it was when we talked last, it was like June 30th or something.
**Bclymer**: I, I obviously we missed that date.
**Bclymer**: Is there a new date or where is that whole thing at with the, with your current.
**Mike**: Yeah, we're, I covered over that out.
**Jmeltzner**: So we're, we're out a couple months on, on that.
**Mike**: But we, and we have a, and.
**Jmeltzner**: We have a death facility and term sheet going into closing here between the 15th and the 20th.
**Mike**: So.
**Jmeltzner**: That'S, that's tied up and it's just again, it's the bridge capital to the larger senior note.
**Jmeltzner**: So kind of happy to, happy to, to look at what you guys are thinking of.
**Jmeltzner**: And, and again, we don't.
**Mike**: We don't.
**Mike**: We, we kind of love the project.
**Jmeltzner**: We love the harborfront retail and the hotel and the, you know, the, the, the marinas and the championship golf and, and so forth.
**Jmeltzner**: We're probably always going, always were going to and probably will partner with the right single family home builders.
**Jmeltzner**: There's, there's three buckets of luxury single family home ranging from 2 million down to, to about a million dollars.
**Jmeltzner**: And then we have 256, what I'll call workforce housing elements.
**Jmeltzner**: You know, those 256 will range from, from about 200 up to about 500.
**Jmeltzner**: So it's a, it's just a great, you know, it's a great T and D new urbanist design.
**Jmeltzner**: It, it's over densified because you know 1900 homes in, you know in, in rural North Carolina, you know we're not going to use all of that density but still have the ability to create an absolutely amazing place.
**Jmeltzner**: You know community is fantastic.
**Jmeltzner**: Political, political desire for us to do it is absolutely fantastic.
**Jmeltzner**: You know there's a lot of benefits of the site.
**Jmeltzner**: There's 3, 250, let's say I think they're 250 yards, not 250ft channels dug out into the sand.
**Jmeltzner**: The environmental remediation in the sound has been completed and vested.
**Jmeltzner**: You know that alone took them four years to just get through.
**Jmeltzner**: You know two seagrass growing seasons.
**Mike**: All that, all that stuff's done and.
**Jmeltzner**: We, we have the ability to come in and perfect it.
**Jmeltzner**: So we're, we're, we're super excited about you know, about what it holds.
**Jmeltzner**: You know we've got a great person on our experiential side.
**Jmeltzner**: Leah started her career in fashion.
**Jmeltzner**: She ran Tim Gunn's Life and Project Runway for a number of years starting in fashion.
**Jmeltzner**: But she opened the Oculus and the new Trade center in New York City and then the retail portion of that and the experience in place and sponsorship and branding and then she opened up Hudson Yards retail and open space in the vessel and then was with the third largest hotel operator in the country running experiential on the hospitality side for, for two or three years before joining us Joel was on with us, was chief strategy officer for another number of large companies like Boeing, Lockheed Martin.
**Jmeltzner**: Opened his own tech firm.
**Jmeltzner**: Dr. William puts us, joins our group really around business strategy and strategic advantage.
**Jmeltzner**: But he's written three books, doctorate from Cornell, taught and dean of faculty London School of Business.
**Mike**: So you know a bunch of really.
**Jmeltzner**: Interesting firepower on our side that unanimously loves the project and loves the, the ramp up to it.
**Jmeltzner**: Having said that building 9,000 units of multifamily, having a new termination of the high speed rail on the east coast is also equally appealing.
**Mike**: So it's always a little bit of.
**Jmeltzner**: Discussion of knowing what you do really well, knowing what you can execute impeccably at and how much time do you have to do all those things.
**Mike**: So Brendan, I'm not, I'm not sure when you're back but you know, and Mike and Philip, if we all just.
**Jmeltzner**: Want to you know, exchange a few emails and, and figure it out and jump On a call.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I'm back next week.
**Bclymer**: So Phil, myself and Mike will jump on a call here and, and kind of get our, our stuff aligned and then I'll, I'll, you know, we'll put an email together with all of us and view and you know, just coordinate from there.
**Mike**: Yeah, I think it's great.
**Mike**: That's great.
**Mike**: We have a, we have a former number microphone.
**Bclymer**: You guys have your questions.
**Fknapp**: Go ahead.
**Fknapp**: Frederick, you were going to say something.
**Mike**: So, yeah, we have a former number.
**Jmeltzner**: One PGA golfer lined up who's once in partnership with us to do golf and those types of things.
**Jmeltzner**: But if you all sign off on the NDA, I'll, you know, I'll step you through a little bit of the, the, the high level discussion.
**Jmeltzner**: The land, the current site plans.
**Jmeltzner**: You know, a lot of that stuff is, is in the mix.
**Jmeltzner**: I think you'll, I think you'll find you would be really pretty hard to do, you know, change the phasing.
**Jmeltzner**: We've already changed the phasing as to how when it gets built.
**Jmeltzner**: We budgeted this out for a couple years and looking at the, the prospects of it, so, and happy to step you through it.
**Mike**: Okay.
**Fknapp**: And I do think all three of us have signed the NDA, right, Phil?
**Fknapp**: You did?
**Philip**: Yeah, I signed it.
**Fknapp**: Brandon has.
**Fknapp**: Yeah.
**Fknapp**: So we're, we're covered there, but that makes sense.
**Fknapp**: And you're, you're based out of Indianapolis.
**Mike**: Frederick or New York?
**Fknapp**: Oh, New York.
**Jmeltzner**: I'm right outside of New York City.
**Mike**: Okay.
**Fknapp**: Sorry.
**Mike**: Joel.
**Jmeltzner**: Joel's in Denver.
**Mike**: Okay.
**Fknapp**: Maybe we can meet face to face, but in due time, guys.
**Mike**: Yeah.
**Mike**: You all are in Florida.
**Fknapp**: We all have offices in Florida.
**Fknapp**: I'm in Cincinnati, Brandon's in Indy, he splits time.
**Fknapp**: And Phil's in Grand Rapids, Michigan.
**Fknapp**: So.
**Mike**: Yeah, I got it.
**Mike**: Yeah.
**Mike**: All right.
**Fknapp**: Not a bad time of year to be up north, but you know, I question my decision sometimes in January and February.
**Mike**: Yeah.
**Mike**: Yeah.
**Mike**: And around World Series, super bowl and.
**Jmeltzner**: NBA championships with it.
**Jmeltzner**: You know, Cincinnati.
**Jmeltzner**: Get there one day.
**Fknapp**: Yeah, well, I grew up near Cleveland, so I didn't upgrade much.
**Fknapp**: I mean, you know, been a rough 40 years.
**Mike**: I, I will tell you, best street.
**Jmeltzner**: Food in the world is in Cleveland, though.
**Mike**: Sneaky.
**Fknapp**: Good food scene, actually.
**Fknapp**: Yeah, there's some surprises there.
**Jmeltzner**: Yeah, it's been trying for a long time.
**Fknapp**: Yeah.
**Mike**: All right, y' all have a great fourth of July.
**Mike**: And again, let's just, let's go into.
**Jmeltzner**: It either iteratively and say, yeah, there is something there.
**Jmeltzner**: No, there isn't.
**Jmeltzner**: Happy to just talk through the.
**Jmeltzner**: The ideas beats paper all day long.
**Jmeltzner**: And when we reach something, then we'll just put it on paper and go.
**Mike**: Perfect.
**Mike**: All right.
**Fknapp**: Makes sense.
**Fknapp**: Guys, pleasure meeting you.
**Fknapp**: Appreciate the time.
**Fknapp**: Have a great holiday weekend.
