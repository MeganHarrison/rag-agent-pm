## Transcript
**Eileeniglesias2**: Why does it not show up as piglet?
**Samanthaleigh840**: She's here eating soups, and she's having a hard time right now.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Eating what?
**Eileeniglesias2**: She likes them.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Taking the soups.
**Samanthaleigh840**: I'll show it to you.
**Samanthaleigh840**: One second.
**Eileeniglesias2**: What is it, Zooks?
**Samanthaleigh840**: The little soups, you know, like for the baby.
**Eileeniglesias2**: No, I have no idea.
**Luke**: Well, but look at her.
**Luke**: She's just like, full of.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Look.
**Luke**: Having a hard time.
**Samanthaleigh840**: You see.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Say hi.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Little thing.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Hi.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Brandon, why don't.
**Eileeniglesias2**: She's like, I don't want to see him.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I know.
**Samanthaleigh840**: There she is.
**Luke**: Oh, Ellen, is there.
**Samanthaleigh840**: One second.
**Bclymer**: Hi.
**Eileeniglesias2**: What up, you guys.
**Eileeniglesias2**: You guys can speak Spanish to each other?
**Luke**: Yeah, I don't know what happened.
**Luke**: I. I requested the time to be.
**Samanthaleigh840**: 5Pm.
**Luke**: But I. I guess I got confused with the.
**Luke**: The time zone thing.
**Luke**: But I. I've got probably a solid 20 minutes to kill before I gotta meet a customs agent.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah, no worries.
**Eileeniglesias2**: No big deal.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah, this is Maria.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I think Luke just joined, too.
**Speaker 4**: Hey, guys.
**Speaker 4**: Nice to meet you.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah, this is obviously Maria.
**Eileeniglesias2**: She's the one that took care of us in.
**Eileeniglesias2**: In Spain and Italy and Croatia and then.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah, this is Eileen.
**Eileeniglesias2**: And then Sam's gonna join here in a minute, so.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So basically, Luke and I, you know, like, I. I've sponsored a ton of these events, you know, for different people in Florida, and they all kind of suck.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So we were like.
**Eileeniglesias2**: At the last one, we were like, let's just do our own thing, you know, because we don't have to sit here and go ask sponsors for money and.
**Eileeniglesias2**: And then try to skimp out on this.
**Eileeniglesias2**: That the other.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So we make a dollar.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So what we were thinking is we'll do like 20 grand as a budget.
**Eileeniglesias2**: And then for the.
**Eileeniglesias2**: For the weekend time frame.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So we were looking at.
**Eileeniglesias2**: It would be, I'm thinking, right after Business Mastery, Luke.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So I think that's the 22nd, 23rd.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Is that correct?
**Eileeniglesias2**: Because I think the BM's the 18th, right.
**Samanthaleigh840**: 17 for you?
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yep.
**Eileeniglesias2**: When.
**Eileeniglesias2**: When does.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Marie.
**Eileeniglesias2**: When does Business Mastery.
**Eileeniglesias2**: When do I get done with business mastery?
**Samanthaleigh840**: From 12th to the August 17th.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Okay, so then.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah, the 23rd.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Luke, does that work for you?
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yep.
**Speaker 4**: That's good with me.
**Eileeniglesias2**: All right, cool.
**Eileeniglesias2**: And so that gives us, you know, roughly six weeks or I guess five weeks to knock it out.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So the.
**Eileeniglesias2**: The biggest thing, you know, that we want to do, you know, is thinking about like 100 people.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Be a good number.
**Eileeniglesias2**: You know, we want it to be something that.
**Eileeniglesias2**: What up?
**Eileeniglesias2**: Hey, Sam, this is Luke and Maria.
**Eileeniglesias2**: And you already know Eileen.
**Eileeniglesias2**: You're muted, by the way.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Still muted.
**Eileeniglesias2**: That's okay.
**Eileeniglesias2**: There you go.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yes.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Okay.
**Luke**: Hello.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Turn left.
**Speaker 4**: Hey, how you doing?
**Bclymer**: Great.
**Bclymer**: How is everyone?
**Bclymer**: Thanks for your patience.
**Bclymer**: I was getting out of Trader Joe's.
**Eileeniglesias2**: No worries.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah, so we were just talking.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So basically what we're thinking, we.
**Eileeniglesias2**: We said on August 23rd is when.
**Eileeniglesias2**: The date that we're thinking.
**Eileeniglesias2**: The 23rd or 30th.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Either one works for me, Luke.
**Speaker 4**: Same here.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yep.
**Eileeniglesias2**: When's Memorial Day weekend, though?
**Eileeniglesias2**: We need to avoid that.
**Speaker 4**: Isn't it the first week?
**Speaker 4**: First Monday of September.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah, it might be.
**Bclymer**: Or Labor Day.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah, whatever it is, Labor Day.
**Bclymer**: Like usually like on the 7th of September.
**Eileeniglesias2**: It's September 1st.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So then that we.
**Eileeniglesias2**: The.
**Eileeniglesias2**: The 30th is out.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Actually Austin.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I think we'll be in Austin Loop that weekend.
**Eileeniglesias2**: That's Ingmar's thing anyway.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Okay, so then.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah, so then that pretty much forces us at August 23rd, which gives us five weeks.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Our budget is 20 grand.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So, Maria, we need to set up an entity.
**Eileeniglesias2**: If you can go ahead and do that.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Just use our office address and put Luke and I as 50, 50 owners.
**Eileeniglesias2**: We'll come up with some, you know, whatever.
**Eileeniglesias2**: It can just be, you know, BNL events or, you know, whatever.
**Eileeniglesias2**: It doesn't really matter.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Just use our two initials or something, whatever, just to get something registered.
**Eileeniglesias2**: And then that way we can run the money through there.
**Eileeniglesias2**: And so we'll do that.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So the.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Obviously we want to do 100 people.
**Eileeniglesias2**: The thought is like, something that kind of like what I was telling you, Sam, like, you know, to get a good event, you know, it's going to get high quality women because high quality men are going to go where high quality women is.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So the.
**Eileeniglesias2**: The thought is creating something where, you know, every girl is going to be like high end girls would be like, I got to go to that.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I can't miss it.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So, you know, I think marketing obviously is going to be crucial.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I don't know about that.
**Eileeniglesias2**: That's where you three come in, you know, but I'd say, like, probably run some paid ads or something like that on Instagram to do that.
**Eileeniglesias2**: You know, hire some photographers or whatever.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I'm not sure what that looks like.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Obviously getting a venue is important now.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I don't know.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I mean, you.
**Eileeniglesias2**: How much do you.
**Eileeniglesias2**: How much have you.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Do you like Eileen or Sam as far as, like, getting venues?
**Eileeniglesias2**: Do you guys ever do that?
**Eileeniglesias2**: Are you guys familiar with that process?
**Bclymer**: Eileen and I have different experience in it.
**Bclymer**: I have it for More personal and I think Eileen might have it as more corporate, but I definitely do have experience.
**Bclymer**: I've already been kind of reaching out and getting feelers of some local venues that kind of differ in style.
**Bclymer**: But the follow through process I don't have as much experience in.
**Eileeniglesias2**: What do you mean follow through process?
**Bclymer**: Just like bookings.
**Bclymer**: Just bookings.
**Bclymer**: Like, I've booked venues for myself twice ever.
**Eileeniglesias2**: What do you mean bookings?
**Eileeniglesias2**: You mean as far as writing a check?
**Bclymer**: Well, the check and kind of just the logistics of how, like how much you want dividend into what?
**Bclymer**: Like what if you have your venue, then what vendors do you have and how many vendors do you need and what stats, styles and then foods.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Like, so Maria, why don't, you know, like, why don't you help that since you're really good with that?
**Eileeniglesias2**: Like now the biggest thing is let's, you know, figuring out like some venue options, right?
**Eileeniglesias2**: And we got to be fast on that to see, you know, what's available.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So, you know, maybe tomorrow or whatever, we start calling when I see we, I mean you, Maria, and then kind of see what's available for that date, you know, time frame.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I don't know.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Luke, what do you think?
**Eileeniglesias2**: Like, or I guess girls, what do you think?
**Eileeniglesias2**: Like, is it.
**Eileeniglesias2**: The event starts at 8, 9.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Like, what's a time?
**Luke**: Yeah, I mean, the last event that we, the last couple events that I've been to go from 6 to 10, 10.
**Luke**: Most people show up around the later half.
**Luke**: So like 8 to 10.
**Luke**: And then there's typically an after party either at the same venue or somewhere else.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Are you riding a suitcase right now?
**Eileeniglesias2**: Because it looks like you are.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Oh, there it is right here.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Thank you.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah, I mean, yeah, because like a lot of those networking events and like, that's what they are, like, networking events.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Like, this is not a networking event.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Like, there is no agenda.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Like, we're not sitting here trying to be like, oh yeah, like, look at me, I'm cool.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Like, we already know we're cool.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Like, you know, Luke and I, we can wear whatever the fuck we want because we actually have money.
**Eileeniglesias2**: You know, like a lot of these other guys are posters.
**Eileeniglesias2**: And so the biggest thing is like, we just want to throw a real quality high end party event to where, you know, people can come have fun.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So it's, you know, open bar.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Like, you know, everybody's like, this is a fun party, like a Saturday night.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Like, I want to go hang out.
**Eileeniglesias2**: And then, you know, as far as an after party or whatever, like, I don't know.
**Eileeniglesias2**: We can look into that and, like, maybe get, like, a couple tables at a club somewhere.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I remember the last couple after parties we went to.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Luke and I got stuck with the fucking bill anyway, so.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Same shit.
**Speaker 4**: I vote no after party.
**Speaker 4**: I figured this should be the after party.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah, there you go.
**Bclymer**: I vote no after party.
**Bclymer**: Like, the party should be, like, fulfilling enough.
**Bclymer**: Like, our get together should be fulfilling enough.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Perfect.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah.
**Eileeniglesias2**: People can go do their own.
**Bclymer**: We're exclusive afterwards, too.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah.
**Eileeniglesias2**: They're not gonna leave.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I would think 6pm is a little early to start it.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I would lean more towards like, eight, like 18 every night.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I agree.
**Eileeniglesias2**: All right, so let's do that.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So the 23rd.
**Eileeniglesias2**: 8 to midnight is our window.
**Eileeniglesias2**: You know, now the biggest thing is.
**Eileeniglesias2**: All right, like, coming up with obviously, location theme.
**Speaker 4**: I mean.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I don't know.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I just don't know anything about locations, like, at all.
**Eileeniglesias2**: What's the Tampa?
**Speaker 4**: You're definitely Tampa for sure, right?
**Eileeniglesias2**: Tampa or St. Pete.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I mean, really, it doesn't.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I mean, we could do the east side of St. Pete, you know, like the.
**Eileeniglesias2**: What is that pure thing or whatever, like, area downtown.
**Speaker 4**: St. Pete somewhere.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah, yeah.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Or.
**Luke**: I would suggest Tampa only because a lot of the people that are going probably live in Tampa, and they're going to want to take Ubers.
**Luke**: Ubers to St. Peter.
**Luke**: More expensive than an Uber to somewhere local to, like, downtown.
**Bclymer**: Like 10 minutes from downtown Tampa, I.
**Luke**: Would say, is ideal.
**Luke**: Like, that's how I think when I'm going to events in terms of theme.
**Luke**: So I. I had obviously at was just in tulum with Sam, and he kind of ran me down on the concept, the idea, the goal, the vision, and we can come up with a theme.
**Luke**: I think that's super important.
**Luke**: That's something I mentioned to him as well, because for.
**Luke**: Especially for the girls, it helps them to be able to put together an outfit.
**Luke**: We can put together a lookbook as well.
**Luke**: We can also do a photo shoot or promo for the event of what the lookbook would be with me, Sam, some other girls as well.
**Luke**: And that can be our marketing content.
**Luke**: But, yeah, I think venue is the most important one that we have to figure out, like, asap, because we want to get that, like, squared away in the books.
**Luke**: Eight to ten.
**Luke**: Did we say 8 to 10pm Is that what we want the time to be?
**Eileeniglesias2**: Eight to midnight?
**Luke**: Eight to midnight.
**Luke**: Okay, cool.
**Luke**: Yeah, I think that's plenty of time.
**Luke**: And by that time, like, most people are gonna either, like, go and party or just go home.
**Bclymer**: So I think that's perfect.
**Bclymer**: Already have.
**Bclymer**: And I can email this to Maria or I can put this in, like a total email.
**Bclymer**: I have two venues that I've already talked to.
**Bclymer**: The date was tentative, but it does seem like they have a lot of availability.
**Bclymer**: So it's the vault and Armature works.
**Bclymer**: Armature has a little more space because they have an outdoor patio, but the vault has a lot of indoor crazy, like, high ceilings that we can tailor to whatever theme that we choose.
**Bclymer**: So I don't know if you were thinking, theme wise, what you guys do have an idea on or if you want it to even be a theme, let alone an embodiment of just the vibe.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I. I don't.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Luke, I don't have any idea on theme to you.
**Speaker 4**: I haven't thought yet, but I will start brainstorming tonight.
**Bclymer**: I keep.
**Bclymer**: When I think about, like, this, and I think about you guys and like, Brandon, how you said, like, successful men will follow the women, I envision, like, not a Great Gatsby Roaring 20s theme, but a more just like a speakeasy, just leather and scotch smoke in the room kind of vibe.
**Bclymer**: And I don't know if that's cliche or what you guys even see yourself as, but that's like, what keeps popping up in my head.
**Eileeniglesias2**: What would be cool is to get like an old warehouse, fit it out.
**Eileeniglesias2**: That'd be pretty, pretty sweet.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah.
**Eileeniglesias2**: As far as, as far as you were saying, you're back to your comments, Sam.
**Eileeniglesias2**: You're about the emails of.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Filter everything through Maria.
**Eileeniglesias2**: She'll be the.
**Eileeniglesias2**: The keeper of everything.
**Eileeniglesias2**: And.
**Eileeniglesias2**: And you know, she'll.
**Eileeniglesias2**: She'll be able to keep me in line, so that'll be easy.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I mean, this place is cool.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I'm looking at the.
**Eileeniglesias2**: The vault, the gallery and stuff.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Like, it looks tight.
**Eileeniglesias2**: This is right.
**Eileeniglesias2**: This is right downtown, right?
**Bclymer**: I think I've seen this building right downtown.
**Bclymer**: It's right.
**Bclymer**: They're like sister companies.
**Bclymer**: The CW gin joint, gin joints.
**Bclymer**: Kind of overrated in my opinion, but it embodies that same exact feeling that like, you would have in the vault.
**Bclymer**: Just times three, three or four.
**Bclymer**: Because of the space.
**Bclymer**: They confirmed you can even have, like, aerial dancers because it has very high ceilings.
**Bclymer**: But they are weary that we don't have enough guests because it's a really large space.
**Bclymer**: So they said, like 150 guests is, like, gonna make the space feel too big.
**Eileeniglesias2**: 150 is gonna make it too big.
**Speaker 4**: Because that's too small.
**Speaker 4**: 150 is too small.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, like 150 is too small essentially.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Gotcha.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Do you have any idea what it caught?
**Eileeniglesias2**: What they even charged for it?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, so I have it all like hyperlinked here.
**Bclymer**: So basically it seems that we'd be doing the corporate package that is base 11,000.
**Bclymer**: I can send over to Maria what it all entails.
**Bclymer**: But this is like some questions too is do you guys want like a stage with microphones and you want at some point to talk to them like people there and thank them?
**Bclymer**: Like that's.
**Bclymer**: Those are like my new add ons of different packages.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah, I mean but I, it doesn't necessarily matter because we're not gonna have 250 people anyway.
**Bclymer**: Right?
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So you know, moot point, you know.
**Eileeniglesias2**: And you know, I, I'm.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I'm curious.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Like you know, Eileen brought up about the.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Oh, I can.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Uber is more expensive, you know, to St. Pete versus Tampa, which I mean I, I Uber to St. Pete beach all the time.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Now maybe I just don't give a.
**Eileeniglesias2**: About a hundred dollar Uber and some people do like, but it, I mean now granted that's an Uber black, but you could probably take a X for 30 bucks.
**Bclymer**: I think convenience, like people would rather pay for the convenience than the like inconvenience.
**Bclymer**: It's like it's inconveniencing to go to St. Pete.
**Bclymer**: But if there is a convenient way for them to get there or say in their ticket price is a 50 voucher.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Why?
**Eileeniglesias2**: Why?
**Eileeniglesias2**: Well, there is no ticket price.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Tickets are free.
**Eileeniglesias2**: We're not charging people for tickets.
**Bclymer**: I didn't know like, I don't know how you'd want to, to make a return if, if you're looking for a return.
**Eileeniglesias2**: We don't.
**Eileeniglesias2**: This is not a money maker for.
**Eileeniglesias2**: This isn't.
**Eileeniglesias2**: This would not even be worth our time to make money on.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Like literally Luke, Luke makes millions trading land.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Like.
**Eileeniglesias2**: No, but.
**Eileeniglesias2**: No, I would say I, I guess, you know, so it's like, okay, well if our, if we're attracting more people from Tampa or we think more people are coming to Tampa, my question would be why, like are there not people that, you know, we want to, you know, come that are in St. Pete, right?
**Eileeniglesias2**: Like, or is the dimit.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Is there not as many of the, you know, 25 to 35 demographic in St. Pete like that?
**Eileeniglesias2**: Why do you guys think that there'd be more people from Tampa?
**Luke**: So for me it's kind of based on my experience how having been going to these events now for a hot minute, a lot of.
**Luke**: So downtown Tampa is kind of the hub for wealthy people in the city.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Luke**: Like, if you.
**Luke**: If you're anybody, you're living in downtown Tampa or south Tampa.
**Luke**: Not.
**Luke**: I don't know many people that live in St. Pete, and if I do, they're typically a lot older, around the 40 to 60 range.
**Luke**: And I don't know if that's the kind of crowd that we want to attract.
**Luke**: I mean, if.
**Luke**: If it is.
**Luke**: And then we can definitely look at St. Pete.
**Luke**: But I. I think I'm just mentioning that out of one experience within two.
**Luke**: Convenience to Sam's point.
**Luke**: Sorry, I'm out of breath, but yeah, that.
**Luke**: That's my 2 cents on it.
**Eileeniglesias2**: You hear that, Luke?
**Eileeniglesias2**: You're not successful because you live in St. Pete, you freak.
**Speaker 4**: Hey, man, it's all good.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Although.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Although I'm still.
**Speaker 4**: I totally agree with her, though.
**Speaker 4**: She's right, though.
**Speaker 4**: She is right.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Now I'm rethinking.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So I'm looking at this six million dollar house on Snell island and I'm like, man, maybe I should not buy that now if it makes me old.
**Speaker 4**: Yeah, I'm not a follower.
**Speaker 4**: I'm a leader.
**Eileeniglesias2**: That's right.
**Eileeniglesias2**: You are.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I wish I KNEW More about St. Pete.
**Bclymer**: I mean, apparently there's a lot of, like, hidden.
**Bclymer**: Hidden gem places around there, but they're obviously a little too hidden that they're not talked about or, you know, a hot spot to go to.
**Bclymer**: So I don't know enough.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Okay.
**Speaker 4**: Yeah, I agree with Eileen.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah.
**Speaker 4**: The demographics in downtown Tampa, for sure.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Okay.
**Eileeniglesias2**: All right.
**Speaker 4**: I'm just a rarity, so.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah.
**Eileeniglesias2**: All right, so then we'll look at that.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Let's see here.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I mean, you know, it's funny because the populations aren't that different.
**Eileeniglesias2**: It's 261,000 for St. Pete and 393 for Tampa.
**Bclymer**: It feels like 393 in Tampa, though.
**Bclymer**: Like St. Pete.
**Bclymer**: Everyone's so spread out, it seems where Tampa.
**Bclymer**: You're all on top.
**Bclymer**: Like, that's how we run into the same six people from all these events because we're just all on top of each other.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah, I just.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I was.
**Eileeniglesias2**: That surprised me.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I didn't think that St. Pete would have that big of a population compared to Tampa.
**Eileeniglesias2**: All right, cool.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So we're Tampa area.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So I guess we need to figure out a list of places.
**Eileeniglesias2**: And I guess depending on what's available will probably dictate a little bit of the theme, I would think.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, that too.
**Bclymer**: That too.
**Bclymer**: And again, like, so this other one, the armature works.
**Bclymer**: One, there's, they have two options.
**Bclymer**: They have an indoor or they have like a patio.
**Bclymer**: So like if you want a more outdoorsy, like summery feel, I would say the patio.
**Bclymer**: But if we want more like exclusive indoor like dim lighting kind of theme, we would do an indoor.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So I, I would think we would, it would be the best ideal would be some sort of indoor outdoor combo.
**Eileeniglesias2**: What do you think, Luke?
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah, I agree.
**Speaker 4**: I'm trying to wrap my head around these venues.
**Speaker 4**: I haven't gone to many.
**Speaker 4**: I keep thinking of like a house party, you know, like I'm saying like a big mansion house party, but I guess we're not.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So I don't know if those are big enough.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah, 100 people, you know.
**Speaker 4**: No, no, it had to be a mansion.
**Speaker 4**: That's what I'm saying.
**Speaker 4**: It has to be like.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, and I even looked on Airbnb for those.
**Bclymer**: Like those are very slim to come by.
**Speaker 4**: Yeah, I'm sure they are.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Well, and they don't, they don't want them.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, they're all in residentials.
**Bclymer**: Like they're, yeah.
**Luke**: Armature is a really cool venue.
**Luke**: I hope that we can find out a little bit more about that one because.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah, I like armor.
**Bclymer**: Information on them as well.
**Bclymer**: I am still putting it in a doc, but they emailed me back as well.
**Bclymer**: I also want to say having the patio, I mean having the indoor outdoor, you have a pre function option which gives you the outdoor patio or an indoor room.
**Bclymer**: So there's like multiple spots that you can run out in the same night.
**Bclymer**: I'll send all that to Maria because I have it in a document right now.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Yeah, please send that everything to me and we'll make sure you know that we can have the venues and everything on time.
**Samanthaleigh840**: So.
**Samanthaleigh840**: And then if you guys like that ones and I mean, I don't know if you guys.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Well, you guys have to decide a team then.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Depending on that one.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Yeah, send me everything.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Thank you, Samantha.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah, it's funny, I, I, I'm looking here at some places like.
**Eileeniglesias2**: And so the Volt and Armature works pop.
**Eileeniglesias2**: And then there's this place called Geos Lounge or the Ritz Lines Den, Hotel Alba.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Pool deck or ballroom.
**Eileeniglesias2**: We don't know the ballroom.
**Bclymer**: I've heard of Hotel Alba.
**Eileeniglesias2**: How about the zoo?
**Eileeniglesias2**: No, I'm dead serious.
**Eileeniglesias2**: We have this.
**Eileeniglesias2**: No, seriously, you can do it.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So we do it here in Indianapolis.
**Eileeniglesias2**: It's called Zoobulation.
**Eileeniglesias2**: It's the biggest, most exclusive party of the year every year.
**Luke**: I mean Only thing I worry about is weather because it's summertime and it's so rainy in Tampa.
**Luke**: And if we have somebody that's completely outdoors and we get rained out, that.
**Bclymer**: Would be really hot.
**Samanthaleigh840**: True, true.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I mean, I think, you know, I think.
**Eileeniglesias2**: See here, let's do Tampa events.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I mean, they've got the pavilion here.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Check this out.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So, like, here's your indoor outdoor type thing you've got.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I mean, that's a nice little setup.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I mean, so they, they, they.
**Eileeniglesias2**: They definitely do some.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So, I mean, it's not a.
**Eileeniglesias2**: You know, I.
**Eileeniglesias2**: It's just an idea.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Right?
**Eileeniglesias2**: Like, it's different, you know, Hi.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Hideout in Hide House.
**Eileeniglesias2**: That place we went to the.
**Eileeniglesias2**: For the.
**Eileeniglesias2**: In.
**Eileeniglesias2**: In Hyde Park.
**Luke**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: No, we went to home.
**Luke**: I think that's home.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Home.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah, home.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Went to home.
**Bclymer**: That's very lousy.
**Bclymer**: Very exclusive, I guess you could say.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Okay.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So if we can figure out the event location, let's try to source that this week, get that booked in, and then, you know, the marketing probably needs to get figured out.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I. I don't know, like, you know, probably, like, we'll probably want to do something with, like, Luke and I, you know, like.
**Eileeniglesias2**: And, you know, we can get some, you know, whatever.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Get some girls to.
**Eileeniglesias2**: To do the lookbook type, you know, but we'll probably want to put some video together, you know, know, with Luke and I, like, you know, saying whatever.
**Eileeniglesias2**: We'll figure that out and then just drop a few different things like that to get.
**Eileeniglesias2**: To get people to go.
**Eileeniglesias2**: And, I mean, worst case scenario, nobody shows up and we all just, you know, eat and drink.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Now, do you have your own, or do you have, like, an idea of anyone with marketing?
**Bclymer**: Because we do have some connections, like, and you've met some of them, too, at, like, the MMG event.
**Bclymer**: So, like, Jerome is a great videographer and photographer if you want to get, like, still videos of you and Luke or whatever.
**Bclymer**: So don't know if you have.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Oh, yeah, I'm.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I'm open to whatever.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Photographer, videographer.
**Eileeniglesias2**: That's Maria's apartment.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah, it doesn't really matter to me.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I mean, I always look good in camera, so.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Well, I need to do a lot of Photoshops, but.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Oh, look at that.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Just hitting it hard.
**Bclymer**: Just kidding, Maria.
**Bclymer**: I can.
**Bclymer**: I'll also get you in contact with the videographer for that is like my tried and true dude.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: He's really busy, actually.
**Bclymer**: He just.
**Bclymer**: He was in Spain the same time as you, Brandon.
**Bclymer**: He was.
**Bclymer**: He ran in the ran.
**Bclymer**: In the.
**Bclymer**: The bull run.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Brandon did it too.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Crazy.
**Bclymer**: That's abs.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Maria's gonna cut up a cool video of it.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Yeah, it's actually very cool.
**Samanthaleigh840**: They're just like running like crazy.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: I mean, and they looked like they're having so much fun, but I would never do that day in my life.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Once is enough for me.
**Eileeniglesias2**: All right, cool.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So yeah, the venue thing and then, you know, as far as like, you know, thinking of like some cool, like, you know, have like an ice luge, you know, I think you have a dj, not a live band probably.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Or do you think, what do you think?
**Eileeniglesias2**: Live band or dj?
**Speaker 4**: Dj.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Okay.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Dj.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I love the idea that you talked about with the aerial yoga thing.
**Eileeniglesias2**: You know, I think like, you know, some of that stuff, like that thing, the stuff that.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Oh, you weren't.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Nevermind, you weren't Croatia.
**Eileeniglesias2**: But Maria, you know, the video.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Have you seen the videos from Croatia with the guy and the girl doing it?
**Eileeniglesias2**: Like, that kind of shit's cool.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah.
**Eileeniglesias2**: And then, I don't know, like, that's like, what other cool event?
**Eileeniglesias2**: Like, because at the end of the day, right, like, we want this to be one of.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Of others.
**Eileeniglesias2**: And so if we can make this banger to where everybody's, you know, sharing it, you know, then that would be.
**Eileeniglesias2**: That would be idea.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah, I guess that would be the biggest thing is like, you know, maybe, you know, you guys, girls put your heads together and say, what would, what would it take?
**Eileeniglesias2**: What would I have to see for me to be like, there's no chance I'm missing that party.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Like, that's what we have to do.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Like, let's.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Let's plan backwards.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yep.
**Luke**: A magician.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I mean, that's not a bad actually.
**Eileeniglesias2**: That's actually not a bad idea because especially as people are showing up.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So when I was in Croatia, I was at this event and they had this magician as people are rolling in and he's like doing like card tricks and like these cool quarter things and whatever.
**Eileeniglesias2**: And like I was sitting there mesmerized.
**Eileeniglesias2**: This is amazing.
**Speaker 4**: Like, that's a good one.
**Eileeniglesias2**: And.
**Eileeniglesias2**: And so, yeah, as people are showing up, it's a cool little entertainment thing.
**Bclymer**: I mean, I know for a fact, at least in the year of events that I've been going to, there's never been one at an event I've been to.
**Bclymer**: Like, you almost can close your eyes and walk into any event and just pinpoint what's going to be there and what isn't.
**Bclymer**: So that's That's a really good idea.
**Bclymer**: I like that.
**Bclymer**: I keep imagining also, like, I've never.
**Bclymer**: I don't know, other people have, but those champagne towers and onto that with the glasses.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So it's like 1 and then 4 and then 8, but.
**Bclymer**: And that would just be so visually pleasing to see.
**Bclymer**: They have services for those aerial practitioners to be serving.
**Bclymer**: Like she's upside down in pouring the champagne into the.
**Speaker 4**: Yeah, I've seen that.
**Eileeniglesias2**: It's pretty cool.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah, that would be cool.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah.
**Eileeniglesias2**: One thing, like, all the, all the high quality events that I go to, like, I don't walk in and they go stand in line at a bar.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I walk in and there's already trays of.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Would you like champagne?
**Eileeniglesias2**: Would you like a beer?
**Eileeniglesias2**: Like right there.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah.
**Speaker 4**: We need top notch service as far as that as well.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah.
**Speaker 4**: Bar service.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah, because that's.
**Eileeniglesias2**: That, that.
**Eileeniglesias2**: That'll kill any event.
**Eileeniglesias2**: And every event I've been to recently has the shittiest bar service ever.
**Bclymer**: Shittiest drinks also.
**Bclymer**: And they're charging you like 25 for one just to say that you're there and it's just, well, all out.
**Eileeniglesias2**: We're.
**Eileeniglesias2**: All of ours is open bar, so we're not, you know, which that just.
**Bclymer**: Makes it that much better too.
**Bclymer**: And on top of having service, I did create a mood board.
**Bclymer**: And like in one of the pictures, you can see someone have like a white glove with like a.
**Bclymer**: A plate or like a platter.
**Bclymer**: And then serving champagne like that is the, the expectation, I'd assume.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah.
**Eileeniglesias2**: All right, so.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So biggest thing is, you know, girls, if you guys can brainstorm on, like, what would it have to be for me to say I'm not missing that event.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So, like, you know, for Eileen, we know it's a magician.
**Eileeniglesias2**: You know, for Sam, it's aerial yoga.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Me and Luke is.
**Eileeniglesias2**: It's just Bud Light.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So, yeah, if you guys can brainstorm that and like, let's just again, like every time that I. I do something, like, I never want to discount any idea.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Like it's just you put down on paper and then you just back into it.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Right.
**Eileeniglesias2**: And then you'll stumble across something good nine times out of 10.
**Eileeniglesias2**: And so if we just stumble through that and figure it out and then tomorrow, Maria, if you can get with Sam, I don't know if you have everybody's contact information, but just get their contact information.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Eileen, Sam.
**Eileeniglesias2**: And let's bird dog the events locations so we can figure out what's available and then that'll help guide because we're going to have to lock that in asap.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Sam, do you want me to set up like a quick meeting with you tomorrow and Eileen too, so we can go through these and then we just have something for the guys already set up?
**Samanthaleigh840**: Yeah, maybe we can have like a document and budget and everything.
**Samanthaleigh840**: So we'll do that.
**Luke**: Yeah, I'm cool with that.
**Luke**: I would like to discuss comps before we move any further.
**Luke**: Obviously I'm very grateful for the opportunity to be involved in planning the event, but I do have a full time job, which you know, so I'm gonna have to be managing that from this.
**Luke**: So what were you guys thinking in terms of compensation?
**Eileeniglesias2**: Why don't you send me a what you're thinking proposal?
**Eileeniglesias2**: I don't plan events for a living, so I don't have to know.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Okay, sounds good.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Cool.
**Eileeniglesias2**: And then Luke, Maria will reach out to you to.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I think we gotta get your social probably to set up the llc.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Got it.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yep.
**Samanthaleigh840**: I'll text you.
**Samanthaleigh840**: This is just.
**Samanthaleigh840**: You don't want to create a.
**Samanthaleigh840**: You don't want to create a page or anything, right?
**Samanthaleigh840**: Like no Instagram page for the event.
**Samanthaleigh840**: No nothing.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Right.
**Samanthaleigh840**: This is just like a fun thing.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Not like.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Or do you want to.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I mean it's just a fun event thing.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And then I think we could do like.
**Bclymer**: Like if Brandon and Luke you.
**Bclymer**: Because you can pay for ads like to pop up on someone's random algorithm.
**Bclymer**: So just like a nice staged photo, like a marketed photo of you two like heading to an event or something and just marketing it that way.
**Bclymer**: And then you can have collaborators.
**Bclymer**: So you can even put me or Eileen as a collaborator and it'll pop up on my and my friends feeds as well.
**Bclymer**: So it kind of.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Exposure without creating a new.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Yeah, cross posting will be great.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Eileeniglesias2**: All right.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Cool.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Cool.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Eileen, have a safe flight.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Thank you everybody.
**Eileeniglesias2**: This would be fun.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Okay, I'll set up meetings with you guys.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Brandon, don't leave.
**Samanthaleigh840**: I have a quick question for you.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Don't leave.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Message me on.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Call me on teams.
**Bclymer**: Okay?
**Speaker 4**: All right, guys, see ya.
