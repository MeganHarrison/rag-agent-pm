## Transcript
**Ken.johnson1**: Okay.
**Ken.johnson1**: I think your microphone's muted.
**Speaker 1**: Just a second.
**Speaker 1**: Can you hear me, Jesse?
**Ken.johnson1**: Yeah, I can hear you now.
**Speaker 1**: I just had some work done on my computer yesterday and anytime you have anything like that done, it's in disarray.
**Speaker 1**: I'm trying to get.
**Speaker 1**: Trying to get camera also, but you don't see that.
**Speaker 1**: That's.
**Ken.johnson1**: Yeah, I had to.
**Ken.johnson1**: You got the multiple monitors and I had just get a remote camera because I'd never be looking at the right screen.
**Ken.johnson1**: That's fine.
**Ken.johnson1**: That's not working.
**Speaker 1**: Jesse.
**Speaker 1**: For some reason I can't get.
**Speaker 1**: Can't get camera turned on even with open video.
**Ken.johnson1**: I know for a while like there's a little shutter on the top of my screen and the last computer I had for like a year I thought the camera was broken because only half of the screen would show.
**Ken.johnson1**: But if the shutter was just shut halfway.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I used a recent.
**Speaker 1**: Very recently but it was before yesterday and I did have some.
**Speaker 1**: A little bit of correction of accessing teams but the camera's blocked off and I can't seem to.
**Speaker 1**: It's getting me just a.
**Speaker 1**: I get the.
**Speaker 1**: Want to use your camera for Mike and Mike for the meeting, but I can't seem to get that.
**Ken.johnson1**: Well, Ken, that's okay.
**Ken.johnson1**: If can't get that working.
**Ken.johnson1**: That's.
**Ken.johnson1**: That's fine.
**Speaker 1**: Sorry, I.
**Speaker 1**: I can reschedule if you.
**Speaker 1**: If you'd like.
**Speaker 1**: Or we can do another quick.
**Speaker 1**: Once I get this.
**Speaker 1**: But I'm.
**Speaker 1**: I'm sorry, I can't.
**Ken.johnson1**: I can't get this.
**Ken.johnson1**: No problem, no problem.
**Ken.johnson1**: But yeah, I read through your emails.
**Ken.johnson1**: The.
**Ken.johnson1**: The resume that you sent and looks like you've done quite a bit over your career.
**Ken.johnson1**: If you don't mind, just let me know a little bit about a little bit of everything you've done and been.
**Ken.johnson1**: And I guess you currently live in Florida.
**Speaker 1**: I'm in Tampa, Yes.
**Speaker 1**: I've been in Tampa for quite a while.
**Speaker 1**: 30 years.
**Speaker 1**: But I've traveled in and out of Tampa to do some remote management on projects that are.
**Speaker 1**: Have been scattered all over the country for the most part.
**Speaker 1**: But yeah, I've been in Tampa for quite some time.
**Speaker 1**: Again I sent you.
**Speaker 1**: I'm looking at what.
**Speaker 1**: Trying to see what I sent you for sure.
**Speaker 1**: But I sent you a basically cover letter resume.
**Speaker 1**: Hopefully a pre construction list or precon.
**Speaker 1**: Pre construction civil list.
**Speaker 1**: Did you get that?
**Ken.johnson1**: Yep, yep, I see that.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Little bit of personal.
**Speaker 1**: Basically a personality inventory or workplace and a couple of reference.
**Speaker 1**: A couple of references.
**Speaker 1**: But I'll try to.
**Speaker 1**: You asked for a Summary, kind of.
**Speaker 1**: But you have apparently Alito has such a diverse portfolio of projects which I do as well that I can, I can tell you that I've done most I think of the type of projects that your company does.
**Speaker 1**: More recently it's been in multi family condominium, luxury condominium currently and on the beach.
**Speaker 1**: On the beach in Sarasota and then some, some multi family in Daytona beach and in Fort Myers, some wood frame student housing here in, in Tampa close to the university and then back to a little bit of medical basically pet company, veterinary company that was started here in Tampa grew to the point that Mars, the chocolate company acquired them.
**Speaker 1**: Now Mars is heavily into pet food as well.
**Speaker 1**: So when once Mars, Mars acquired Blue Pearl then they had a lot of money to expand with.
**Speaker 1**: So I was helping them expand kind of across the country, multiple states.
**Speaker 1**: Now that was small work that was a 32 6,000, 3,000 to 6,000 square foot either renovation interior fit out or smaller freestanding buildings.
**Speaker 1**: But the, the part about the pet care was one, it was a lot of what was renovation that I was required to keep an existing veterinary practice open during the time that it was being renovated.
**Speaker 1**: And also I was very much involved in new construction with MRIs and CAT scans and medical, surgical medical facilities within those practices as well.
**Speaker 1**: So a lot of that was relevant.
**Speaker 1**: It's still relevant for human health care as well, although it's on a much smaller scale.
**Speaker 1**: Prior to that I did some work as a owner's representative for some major companies.
**Speaker 1**: Coca Cola, that was a, a formula production facility just northwest of Orlando.
**Speaker 1**: 80 million dollar facility.
**Speaker 1**: And that was one of three like it in the world at that time.
**Speaker 1**: That was about 10 years ago, very complex specific construction within that there were also a couple of laboratories, both a research laboratory and a quality control laboratory as well.
**Speaker 1**: So there was all kinds of gas feeds into that laboratory also.
**Speaker 1**: So that was a complex, pretty intense, high profile project.
**Speaker 1**: The prior to that I did some work with the as a general contractor at risk, but that was back 15 years ago.
**Speaker 1**: Now primarily condominium construction, some retail as well.
**Speaker 1**: I worked again as an owner's representative for the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino here in Tampa.
**Speaker 1**: The original construction of that as the owner's rep.
**Speaker 1**: And that was again interesting project overall, very demanding, obviously very high profile.
**Speaker 1**: Interesting in that it was miles of cable under slab for the slot machines and all the electronics going into that facility.
**Speaker 1**: And then I also worked with Home Depot as a project manager a few years back building new Home Depots.
**Speaker 1**: So that was, that was Big box retail, including merchandising for those, for those facilities that was primarily in Georgia and Florida and a few years then building distribution centers, production, food, excuse me, food production and distribution centers kind of across the country as well.
**Speaker 1**: And that was again big box.
**Speaker 1**: A lot of that was tilt walls also, but for the most part it was a large steel structure with exterior skin of metal panels, insulated metal, metal panels and the refrigeration that went with most of that, all the cold storage.
**Speaker 1**: So that's kind of a quick synopsis of the types of projects that I've done from the administrative end.
**Speaker 1**: I've done a lot of pre construction from conception and then through design, development and construction to completion of facilities.
**Speaker 1**: I've enjoyed the pre construction and some of the work as an owner's representative and that I can start working early on the development of the project and being be involved in finding local subcontractors and some remote areas, working with the authorities having jurisdiction and the municipalities, the local utilities as well, or underground utilities and primarily electrical, and being able to have a relationship or establish a relationship with engineers within the electric company that's providing service to the facility, whatever that might be, as much for timing as it would for the design that would be required for that.
**Speaker 1**: Also dot and ingress egress for some of the larger projects or some projects in, in and around the city that require some, some cases, some closing for a period of time, a street or a highway to access and then ingress egress to whatever the site might have been.
**Speaker 1**: So the pre construction and working then with the design team, with architects, engineers, something I've done quite a bit of also then take that conception through for the owner, through the design team and then onto the construction team and then completion for and oversight of the construction through to certificate of occupancy as well.
**Speaker 1**: Kind of a mixed bag, but it's a process that I'm familiar with from early on through to completion and acceptance of the project.
**Ken.johnson1**: Okay.
**Ken.johnson1**: Yeah, we're so alito, you know, Brandon Clymer, he's the owner, he started this company.
**Ken.johnson1**: I've known Brandon for 12 years.
**Ken.johnson1**: I think we worked together at a GC and at the time they were just in Naples called DeAngelo's Diamond.
**Ken.johnson1**: They're pretty decent sized contractor in Florida and he decided to start his business and he brought me on, you know, some of the projects on our website are ones that we've done, you know, previously.
**Ken.johnson1**: But we're a fast growing company.
**Ken.johnson1**: I mean we'll double what we did last year, this year.
**Ken.johnson1**: And we do all those, you know, that's the type of work we're currently doing and going after, you know, the warehouse, the ground up, you know, retail, getting into the condos, multi family is, you know, is something that's next for us.
**Ken.johnson1**: And it's just, it's been a great, you know, great experience and just because, you know, being a part of the company and able to kind of develop us into that because I've always worked for larger general contractors and took the good and the bad from them all.
**Ken.johnson1**: But you know, you develop your, your operating procedures and your, your company.
**Ken.johnson1**: Think of the word.
**Speaker 1**: Did you work with these and this diamond also.
**Ken.johnson1**: He was to be.
**Ken.johnson1**: I, he actually I hired him as assistant project manager for me and he, I had four different healthcare projects going on at the same time, four different hospitals and he rescued the.
**Ken.johnson1**: I was struggling with the help they were giving me before he showed up.
**Ken.johnson1**: So we worked together there.
**Speaker 1**: Well, I know or knew quite a few years ago because I haven't seen them quite a long time.
**Speaker 1**: I knew both David diamond and John DeAngelis quite a few years ago when they came out of Boring Craig, what was within Boring Craig and Shrek and in Naples.
**Speaker 1**: So yeah, I know the growth of those.
**Speaker 1**: I know knew those two then.
**Speaker 1**: But that was, that was, that was several years ago.
**Speaker 1**: But I'm very familiar with Naples because I lived and worked in Naples also.
**Ken.johnson1**: Yeah, they.
**Ken.johnson1**: So I used to work for a company called MJ Harris.
**Ken.johnson1**: They call themselves America's Healthcare Builder.
**Ken.johnson1**: And I worked with a guy named Reggie Morgan there and DeAngelis diamond hired also another guy, Jason Sain from MJ Harris.
**Ken.johnson1**: And those two brought health care to DeAngelis and completely changed the company.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, you're still there.
**Ken.johnson1**: You know, they just don't have all the, you know, the procedures and processes and standard operating procedures they call it to handle the bigger projects and be successful.
**Ken.johnson1**: And you know, Reggie and Jason asked me to.
**Ken.johnson1**: That's why I want to, to work with them guys is that worked for him for I think eight years before I decided to move on.
**Ken.johnson1**: So they, they got an office in Sarasota now one in Orlando.
**Ken.johnson1**: So like right now it says on your resume your doing a project down in Sarasota, is it?
**Speaker 1**: Yes, it's on Lido Key on the beach in Sarasota.
**Ken.johnson1**: It's a big project for you.
**Speaker 1**: It's huge project, very complex.
**Speaker 1**: It's $175 million in construction costs.
**Speaker 1**: But the units that, that they're building there start at the sales start at 6 and a little bit over 6 million.
**Speaker 1**: So it's very, very, very high end, very luxury.
**Speaker 1**: And some of that is the of course we're not to that point yet of finishing interiors but the owners or the buyers are given the opportunity to work with, with the developer interior designers to design their own interiors if they wish.
**Speaker 1**: Now the developer thinks they're going to make money on that.
**Speaker 1**: I'm not sure that's a good idea because white box is a lot different than getting out of the building is a whole lot different than finishing interiors.
**Speaker 1**: Luxury or customer.
**Ken.johnson1**: You're already building the post tension structure, right?
**Speaker 1**: Oh yeah, yeah.
**Speaker 1**: And that's like two levels of garages, parking.
**Speaker 1**: And I say garages because it's not just drive in and park.
**Speaker 1**: It's every garage has a garage door and it has a back entrance into a shared semi shared elevators with direct access to the units up through the 11th floor.
**Speaker 1**: And there's a podium, two foot deep podium above those garages.
**Speaker 1**: That was pretty interesting.
**Speaker 1**: One day we placed 920 cubic yards of concrete that was a combination the podium and then before you were finished on one end of the podium started erecting formwork for columns as well.
**Speaker 1**: So it's an interesting project but I, I, it's, it's not a happy place.
**Speaker 1**: That's the only reason I'm, only reason I'm looking elsewhere.
**Ken.johnson1**: Yeah, I can, I can imagine that.
**Ken.johnson1**: You know, I, before I finished, you know, came over to here, I finished, did build two both.
**Ken.johnson1**: One was 87 units, the other was 80.
**Ken.johnson1**: You know, both high end luxury condos.
**Ken.johnson1**: Post tension, same thing.
**Ken.johnson1**: I think we paid for 1200 yards of concrete.
**Ken.johnson1**: Yeah, so you're breaking, Yeah, I understand what you're going through on that.
**Ken.johnson1**: And that's like, that's what's the team size on a job that project depends.
**Speaker 1**: On the administrative team or the overall.
**Ken.johnson1**: Do you have like six PMs and 12 supers or are they pretty lean?
**Speaker 1**: There's four, two assistant PMs, four superintendents on, on the team.
**Speaker 1**: The administrative team that we have, have had during, during the structure construction.
**Speaker 1**: 100 to 150 people on site at a time.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, it can get bizarre also.
**Ken.johnson1**: Right?
**Ken.johnson1**: Well yeah, like I said, you know we're coming up, we have a project that we're going to go, you know we're part of the ownership development team on it down in, down south of here.
**Ken.johnson1**: But it's like a 250 acre site.
**Ken.johnson1**: They want to put hotels and condos.
**Ken.johnson1**: It's right on the water, you know, with Gulf access.
**Speaker 1**: I think I lost you.
**Speaker 1**: I'm, I'm getting intermittent.
**Speaker 1**: Sorry Jesse, but I lost you for just a minute.
**Speaker 1**: I don't know if that's at this end or not.
**Ken.johnson1**: It'll start.
**Ken.johnson1**: Yeah.
**Ken.johnson1**: Are you able to hear me?
**Speaker 1**: I can, but again getting, breaking up, breaking up just a little bit intermittently.
**Speaker 1**: I'm trying to get, trying to catch all these hotel 200.
**Ken.johnson1**: Yeah, sometimes I, when my camera's on, it takes up too much bandwidth and no one likes my face.
**Ken.johnson1**: So if I shut the camera off, it works a lot better.
**Speaker 1**: I'm not, I'm not blocking you off, but yeah, you see.
**Speaker 1**: No, I'm not.
**Speaker 1**: I say it seems to be better now that you close the camera.
**Speaker 1**: The video seems to be continuous.
**Speaker 1**: Now you would, I, I, you had mentioned a, a large project somewhere south.
**Speaker 1**: Hotels, condos and kind of a community.
**Ken.johnson1**: Right.
**Ken.johnson1**: Basically a larger job.
**Ken.johnson1**: They're going to expand a marina that's an existing marina to hold like 200 wet slips.
**Ken.johnson1**: I mean it's a pretty big job.
**Ken.johnson1**: But like I said, you know, that's why I would.
**Ken.johnson1**: Looking at what you're looking to do, if you came aboard with us like you know, as a.
**Ken.johnson1**: Doing project management, are you okay with like filling in, you know, until bigger jobs like that start running?
**Ken.johnson1**: A 4 to 6 million dollar job, you know, doing the project management work on it.
**Ken.johnson1**: And almost everything we do is negotiated work, you know, where we're not bidding against other people.
**Ken.johnson1**: It's the owners that come to us.
**Ken.johnson1**: We do the design build, you know, we hire all the architects and engineers and they work for us on these projects as we move through them, which I like that particularly.
**Speaker 1**: Well, you know, that's very good.
**Speaker 1**: I like that also because the, you have accountability right away and you can somewhat, I hope and in some cases you can control the.
**Speaker 1**: What is the typical two week standard for response from architects who wait until typically until the day or day before that and then decide well no, you need to resubmit.
**Speaker 1**: That can play havoc with a, with a schedule.
**Speaker 1**: So yeah, if you can have accountability from the design team more like that to help with the construction.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, that's, that's much better.
**Ken.johnson1**: Yeah.
**Ken.johnson1**: And like so much of the submittal process is like, you know, I don't need an architect to look at the studs.
**Ken.johnson1**: We're framing the job with.
**Ken.johnson1**: Like we should know we can check the submittals and that's what we do.
**Ken.johnson1**: Like we self approve pretty much everything.
**Ken.johnson1**: Like we don't Even get their ad services.
**Ken.johnson1**: You know, they do the drawings for us.
**Ken.johnson1**: We manage the submittals to the owner.
**Ken.johnson1**: Do they like the color?
**Ken.johnson1**: Do they like this or that?
**Ken.johnson1**: You know, it's structurally, you know, you got to get some input from the structural engineer.
**Ken.johnson1**: But for the most part like, you know, we run the jobs and we basically talk to the owner.
**Ken.johnson1**: What do you want it to look like?
**Ken.johnson1**: How much do you want to spend?
**Ken.johnson1**: And then we tell them to draw something that fits into that budget and looks the way they want it.
**Ken.johnson1**: So it's, it's a, it's pretty unique.
**Speaker 1**: Draws another.
**Speaker 1**: I'm sorry to interrupt, but draws another important aspect of, of relationship with the owner as well.
**Speaker 1**: I have had on this project regularly and I had been in charge of the, and as of gc in charge of the application for payment to the owner.
**Speaker 1**: But that has run close to or pretty much averaging $10 million a month for, for the last year, which is pretty much outrageous.
**Speaker 1**: And it takes a lot of coordination with the subcontractors and getting one.
**Speaker 1**: A schedule of values.
**Speaker 1**: Did I just lose you?
**Ken.johnson1**: Yep.
**Ken.johnson1**: No, I'm here.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Well, my screen, I might have to plug in my computer here.
**Speaker 1**: Coordination with schedule the values early on, that can make sense and minimize the back and forth at a later time or during throughout the construction with the subcontractor trying to analyze their, their, their draw schedule and their, their individual items.
**Speaker 1**: Anyway, that's, that's something I'm accustomed to doing.
**Speaker 1**: Answer your question that you asked.
**Speaker 1**: No, I have no problem whatsoever, Jesse, working on smaller projects.
**Speaker 1**: I work small projects, large projects, multiple projects that simultaneously.
**Speaker 1**: So yeah, I would always, I would look forward to a, a significant large project I guess or development.
**Speaker 1**: But there it's all about the parts.
**Speaker 1**: The, the, the pieces and parts that go together anyway, whether it's one building or multiple buildings concurrently.
**Ken.johnson1**: That's the truth.
**Ken.johnson1**: I mean you, you know, been on the big ones, I've done small ones.
**Ken.johnson1**: So it's.
**Ken.johnson1**: Sometimes it's.
**Ken.johnson1**: The only reason I didn't like the smaller jobs was when I was traveling for most of my career I, I didn't like moving every six months.
**Ken.johnson1**: I wanted it to be at least a year long project so I, you know, didn't have to pack up and move.
**Ken.johnson1**: But all right now that's, that's, that's good.
**Ken.johnson1**: That's a good thing.
**Ken.johnson1**: And you know, just, you know, these, you know, the projects we're doing now, like we're building the ground up.
**Ken.johnson1**: It's called the Collective Westfield here in Indianapolis and it's indoor volleyball court with bars and restaurants, two levels of that next to it.
**Ken.johnson1**: And you know that is again it's design build all the design team works for us.
**Ken.johnson1**: Right.
**Ken.johnson1**: I just got off.
**Ken.johnson1**: That was the meeting that ended before ours was started was the weekly design meeting we have with everybody.
**Ken.johnson1**: But you know, that is a lot of work to get with the city and get your permits and get your approvals on your utilities and everything else.
**Ken.johnson1**: So it's good experience you have doing that because we do that on each one of them, you know, since we're leading the project from the beginning.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: And you have to build the project on paper before you get started.
**Speaker 1**: And even if your design build which, which helps you get started earlier, of course you can get a hopefully get a foundation permit and and get going so to speak.
**Speaker 1**: But they still have to have the.
**Speaker 1**: The plan together and the approvals together to coordinate through the rest of the rest of the project.
**Ken.johnson1**: Yeah.
**Ken.johnson1**: And so your travel wouldn't be like if you.
**Ken.johnson1**: If you had a job and say the one in Savannah, Georgia if you would do that for us too.
**Ken.johnson1**: You don't have to be there on site other than check on it once a month or something like that.
**Ken.johnson1**: Is that travel any issue for you to fly there, fly back?
**Speaker 1**: No, not at all.
**Speaker 1**: If you look at on my resume, look at the Enselcon company travel from and I was indicted all of that from.
**Speaker 1**: From Tampa and it was.
**Speaker 1**: It could have been depending on the, the.
**Speaker 1**: The timing of the project and what's going on in the project.
**Speaker 1**: I could be out of the remote area maybe early on for three or four days to get started.
**Speaker 1**: Might be significant timing within the the project for certain construction that would need more attention or more oversight whatever it might might be.
**Speaker 1**: So I've been in and out that way regularly.
**Speaker 1**: Even the Insulcon Company.
**Speaker 1**: I was in Texas, Tennessee, Georgia, Louisiana, Colorado, Minnesota and actually in Hawaii for a project there.
**Speaker 1**: So and, and then also for the.
**Speaker 1**: The Blue Pearl time I was in and out the same way to they were.
**Speaker 1**: They were growing all over the country.
**Speaker 1**: So that was in 20 some states that they were growing.
**Speaker 1**: So no, the traveling's not an issue for me.
**Ken.johnson1**: And did you like when you're starting these prize you interacted with the estimating department built that estimate and budget as well?
**Speaker 1**: Yes.
**Speaker 1**: I'm.
**Speaker 1**: I'm not the guy to.
**Speaker 1**: To sit in an office and do estimating full time.
**Ken.johnson1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Speaker 1**: I don't enjoy that for one and I'm.
**Speaker 1**: I can't make you money doing that just be pretty frank.
**Speaker 1**: I know, I know that.
**Speaker 1**: I know the details, I know the parts.
**Speaker 1**: I can do that somewhat in Bluebeam and the, and I haven't used Bluebeam for a while now but even Bluebeam I've used for a back and forth typically with a back and forth with the design team for a call out for a certain area or an area that might be questions and clarification for that which is pretty quick to do but otherwise that's, that's something I'm, I'm accustomed to doing and that, that's part of the coordination of the pre construction for the estimating and the buyout as well for subcontractors vendors.
**Ken.johnson1**: What we do like we actually have a full time estimator starting here in the next week or so.
**Ken.johnson1**: But it, it's just a matter of like they do all the estimating, making the calls, sending it out bid.
**Ken.johnson1**: We don't really do a lot of square foot stuff, you know, we don't take it off and put numbers to things.
**Ken.johnson1**: But just being able to like once they get that estimate and they say they're done with it, you know, being able to have the PM review it, make sure we're covered, you know, in areas that's all when I was talking about working with the estimating.
**Speaker 1**: So I like to depend on the subcontractor vendor numbers Jesse because especially in the market now, it changes so fast that I want to, I want them to be accountable for that and they are the supposedly the experts in whatever trade it might be.
**Speaker 1**: So they need to be on top of their game for what, what the costs are for whatever the material, whatever the product is.
**Ken.johnson1**: Yeah, absolutely.
**Ken.johnson1**: And what we look for is like though an estimator just as an estimator and sometimes there's things on the drawings or things we just know from our experience like if it's not on and you know we're starting out with you know, some napkin sketches sometimes to get some pricing together and so it's just a matter of like hey let's throw some money in there for this or that because I don't think you know, sub either doesn't include it in their scope or maybe we're missing a sub or two things of that nature.
**Speaker 1**: Well, you should have some historical data and some because you've done so many different types of work, you should have some at least relevant historical data to pull on as well, I would think.
**Ken.johnson1**: Yeah.
**Ken.johnson1**: Oh yeah, Yep.
**Ken.johnson1**: Well like what is your, I mean what's your long term goals?
**Speaker 1**: Well it's to be in, be in a, an environment that for two things, being in a working environment that I can bring my experience and knowledge, diverse experience and knowledge to a team to be useful and to be helpful and, and then also a camaraderie with the people that I'm, I'm working with as well.
**Speaker 1**: That's both a short and long term goal.
**Speaker 1**: That's something that has been missing somewhat where I am and that's, that's really the only reason I'm, I'm looking and I'm looking selectively not looking for another job.
**Speaker 1**: I'm looking for a, A, an environment, I'll say, where I can enjoy working each day, where I can contribute, where I can learn also because I always learn something from, from others involved as well.
**Ken.johnson1**: Yeah.
**Ken.johnson1**: Oh, that's for sure, man.
**Ken.johnson1**: I, some of the best times of my life was when I had, you know, it's a good construction team and it was like a little family on site there.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, yeah.
**Ken.johnson1**: Totally understand that.
**Ken.johnson1**: And like Tampa, St.
**Ken.johnson1**: Pete area, like working in an office there that's convenient for you.
**Ken.johnson1**: That's.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: I live just about 10, 12 miles north of the airport.
**Speaker 1**: Tampa Airport.
**Speaker 1**: So easy in and out for me.
**Speaker 1**: And it's easy pretty much most areas of Tampa.
**Speaker 1**: The traffic is horrible some, most days, depending on where you're going and going from one end of Tampa to another sometimes is a challenge.
**Speaker 1**: But otherwise, you know, I can arrange, I typically would go earlier or stay later or something to that effect and know the best routes at least around Tampa.
**Speaker 1**: Do you have an office in Tampa now?
**Ken.johnson1**: In Tampa, we're looking for a space in St.
**Ken.johnson1**: Pete.
**Ken.johnson1**: Me and Brandon will be there next week, I think Monday.
**Ken.johnson1**: We're gonna go check a couple places out and right there it's kind of, it should be convenient for him.
**Ken.johnson1**: He's in Tampa, I'm in Clearwater and it's right there on the, I think Gandy bridge on the St.
**Ken.johnson1**: Pete side.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I live, I live just off of the A expressway going north from the airport.
**Ken.johnson1**: Is that the Veterans?
**Ken.johnson1**: Is that what it's called?
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, the Veterans Expressway.
**Ken.johnson1**: Veterans, yeah.
**Ken.johnson1**: Okay.
**Ken.johnson1**: Yeah, I remember I did a job in Atlanta and I would leave at like 4:30 in the morning because I had to drive from Marietta north side down to downtown.
**Ken.johnson1**: And then I'd stay on the job till like seven at night just so I didn't spend an hour and a half in traffic.
**Speaker 1**: So I remember I did work, if you'll see, I worked with Metric Constructors in Atlanta, which Was a long time ago.
**Speaker 1**: And that was when there was a metric constructors.
**Speaker 1**: That's the last thing you'll see in my resume.
**Speaker 1**: But that was in Atlanta and I was.
**Speaker 1**: I.
**Speaker 1**: I was living over close to Lawrenceville and driving to Mayretta just north of the beach, just north of the Big Chicken.
**Speaker 1**: But even then the traffic was awful.
**Speaker 1**: I can't imagine what it must be now.
**Ken.johnson1**: Yeah, well, this was back in.
**Ken.johnson1**: I think in that have been 98 or so somewhere in there.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Ken.johnson1**: When I was there.
**Ken.johnson1**: But yeah, I don't like Atlanta, that's for sure.
**Speaker 1**: Are you in Indianapolis now?
**Speaker 1**: Office.
**Ken.johnson1**: Yeah, I come up here every other week typically.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Ken.johnson1**: And work out of up here to help the guys up here.
**Ken.johnson1**: So fly back Friday night.
**Ken.johnson1**: I'll be back.
**Speaker 1**: And you're in Tampa or St.
**Speaker 1**: Pete or Clearwater.
**Ken.johnson1**: Yeah, I live in Clear.
**Ken.johnson1**: Downtown Clearwater.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, okay.
**Ken.johnson1**: And for the last five years, those two condos I built had to drive a mile to work and the First 1 and 2 miles to work for the second one.
**Ken.johnson1**: So I got spoiled.
**Ken.johnson1**: And there's no traffic in.
**Ken.johnson1**: Down in that area, so.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Ken.johnson1**: No, I fit.
**Ken.johnson1**: I fish.
**Ken.johnson1**: I love going to the Gulf, which I haven't.
**Ken.johnson1**: I've been so busy.
**Ken.johnson1**: Haven't gone in a while, but you go out, tear it up.
**Ken.johnson1**: Do you ever go fishing?
**Speaker 1**: I haven't been for quite a while, but I.
**Speaker 1**: I used to do quite a bit, mostly in shore.
**Speaker 1**: Not so much offshore, but mostly in shore fishing.
**Speaker 1**: But the only reason I asked about golf is there's a big Valspar golf tournament over in your neighborhood next.
**Speaker 1**: Next week, I guess, isn't what it is.
**Ken.johnson1**: Okay.
**Ken.johnson1**: Yeah, everyone else here golfs except me, I think.
**Ken.johnson1**: And then we got another project manager and he lives in Clearwater too.
**Ken.johnson1**: He fishes, but like we fish when we.
**Ken.johnson1**: Like when I'm able to, we'll go offshore.
**Ken.johnson1**: But he does that kayak fishing and he tears it up.
**Ken.johnson1**: I mean, he catches, you know, reds and trout and sheep's head and pompano and every other, Every.
**Ken.johnson1**: Every other thing.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, he can get into the mangroves where they're feeding and something like that where you can't get a.
**Speaker 1**: Even a motorized boat in.
**Speaker 1**: And they're so close.
**Ken.johnson1**: Yeah, well, they have zones in that.
**Ken.johnson1**: In that inner coastal where there's no power.
**Ken.johnson1**: You can't have a motor on your boat if you to even go in there.
**Ken.johnson1**: So.
**Ken.johnson1**: Yeah, they're just stacked up so well.
**Ken.johnson1**: Man.
**Ken.johnson1**: Ken, I enjoyed talking to you.
**Ken.johnson1**: I'm gonna.
**Ken.johnson1**: You got my cell phone.
**Ken.johnson1**: I'm going to follow up with Brandon and we'll reach out to you next week when we get back there maybe we can set up time to meet in person.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I appreciate that.
**Speaker 1**: Can I ask you a couple questions Jesse?
**Speaker 1**: You have just a couple.
**Ken.johnson1**: Yeah and I didn't even ask you how much money you want.
**Ken.johnson1**: I mean maybe you want 100, 200,000 a year, I don't know.
**Speaker 1**: So is that what I wanted?
**Speaker 1**: What I'd settle for?
**Ken.johnson1**: What do you settle for?
**Ken.johnson1**: To be happy.
**Ken.johnson1**: So I can tell you to be.
**Speaker 1**: Happy here, be happy.
**Speaker 1**: Well the happy is part of the equation for the money because I'm making more now than you.
**Speaker 1**: You advertise on your posting but on the other hand I'm, I'm, I'm not, I'm not stuck on a monetary number and you had, I think you had 130 as a top.
**Speaker 1**: Not on top of your, your posting.
**Speaker 1**: Is there, is there any room for more than that or.
**Ken.johnson1**: No.
**Ken.johnson1**: Well I'd have to discuss that with Brandon.
**Ken.johnson1**: You know definitely you got the experience and you know the project experience and ability.
**Ken.johnson1**: So what are you looking for?
**Speaker 1**: Well probably that but I also want to consider other things.
**Speaker 1**: What is it?
**Speaker 1**: And I'm, I'm, I'm also getting a car allowance now of 475 I think it is a month.
**Ken.johnson1**: Yeah, we give a 500 car allowance.
**Ken.johnson1**: We give you $70 a month for phone allowance.
**Ken.johnson1**: He matches 401k.
**Ken.johnson1**: I think 4% get health care paid for is good health care like if you're a single person or it's completely free if you're single and it's, then if you're a family then it's, it's still reasonable.
**Ken.johnson1**: I, I don't know.
**Ken.johnson1**: I'm single so I get mine for free at paid vacations.
**Ken.johnson1**: His bonuses he offers up to 20 of your salary and he is very good at bonuses so.
**Speaker 1**: Oh that's, that's good.
**Speaker 1**: I appreciate that also and some occasional time off now.
**Speaker 1**: I do.
**Speaker 1**: Let me ask you this.
**Speaker 1**: Do you have, do you bank a number of days are a number of days banked in the first year for pto.
**Ken.johnson1**: Like in your first year you'll accrue up to the three weeks.
**Speaker 1**: Okay so it's accrued so many hours per pay period.
**Ken.johnson1**: That's right.
**Ken.johnson1**: Every four whatever it is that ratio hours work to create the three weeks paid all paid holidays.
**Ken.johnson1**: You'll get a company card pay for gas going to work.
**Speaker 1**: See all those go into the equation.
**Speaker 1**: Jesse, that's not, that's Yes, I, I want to make money.
**Speaker 1**: That's why we all work to begin with.
**Speaker 1**: But on the other side, the equation of, of being productive, of helping out in a, in a team situation and having some, some degree of accomplishment along the way, whether it be just the end of an individual project or a combination of projects or a growth of the company, whatever that might be.
**Speaker 1**: But I understand that, that the position basically will be based here in Tampa, St.
**Speaker 1**: Pete or Clearwater area with working out of an office and, and traveling to wherever a site might be.
**Speaker 1**: Project.
**Ken.johnson1**: Yeah, it'd be Tampa based.
**Ken.johnson1**: Our office is more than likely going to permanently be in St.
**Ken.johnson1**: Pete and yeah, just occasional travel to a job site or if an owner, if you got an on site owner meeting or you know, like Sanford, I just drive there because it takes two hours or so, two and a half to get to that one.
**Ken.johnson1**: You know, we also, we picked up a client just through my contacts at, at the mechanical stuff I've worked with for years.
**Ken.johnson1**: Have you ever worked with.
**Ken.johnson1**: Dang it, Medicare?
**Ken.johnson1**: They do plumbing and H Vac in Florida?
**Speaker 1**: No, I don't think so.
**Speaker 1**: No, I wouldn't remember that, that name.
**Speaker 1**: So I don't believe I have.
**Ken.johnson1**: Yeah, they hooked me up with Aspire Health.
**Ken.johnson1**: They have like 56 facilities in Florida.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, yeah.
**Ken.johnson1**: So we had two current jobs with them.
**Ken.johnson1**: We did another one we completed, but you know, not big jobs, but you know, eventually that all that adds up.
**Ken.johnson1**: And if they ever built a new facility, you know, I think we'd be their number one builder.
**Ken.johnson1**: It's gone real well so far.
**Ken.johnson1**: So like for those jobs, you know, the ones in St.
**Ken.johnson1**: Lucie, ones in the Ridge Haven facility, they got up in Newport Richey, that one were hopefully wrap up in a month or so.
**Speaker 1**: Well, that's good.
**Speaker 1**: The, the large development you mentioned, where is that?
**Speaker 1**: You said it was south.
**Speaker 1**: Where?
**Ken.johnson1**: Cape Coral.
**Speaker 1**: Huh.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: There's no room in Cape Coral for that much.
**Ken.johnson1**: This is the last piece of land that's available.
**Speaker 1**: Well, so you noted my resume.
**Speaker 1**: Let me look.
**Speaker 1**: It's under tencent construction.
**Speaker 1**: The Concordia.
**Speaker 1**: It's a three.
**Speaker 1**: It was a 300 unit, 30 building development.
**Speaker 1**: Two story, 10 units per building.
**Speaker 1**: Condominium development in Cape Coral.
**Speaker 1**: Kind of north Cape Coral.
**Speaker 1**: So that's why I know there's not much room left in Cape Coral.
**Ken.johnson1**: I know, yeah.
**Ken.johnson1**: That had a girlfriend there, that she had a house and back in all the, you know, with the dock, with the boat lift and I drove my boat there one day.
**Ken.johnson1**: It took 45 minutes to get from her backyard out into the.
**Ken.johnson1**: To the main Caloosahatchee river way.
**Ken.johnson1**: And that's a maze of houses.
**Ken.johnson1**: That's something else what they did there.
**Ken.johnson1**: Yeah that was.
**Speaker 1**: That was back when they could develop like that and they wouldn't be able to do that developers anymore close or fill.
**Speaker 1**: Fill the land like they did there.
**Ken.johnson1**: Yeah, they just dredged out, you know dredged out all the canals and then dumped it on.
**Ken.johnson1**: Made their, made their building lots and sold them.
**Speaker 1**: And now those, now those houses are worth probably half a million anyway.
**Ken.johnson1**: Yeah, she bought like after the, you know she bought hers like in 2000.
**Ken.johnson1**: I don't know, 14 or 15.
**Ken.johnson1**: No.
**Ken.johnson1**: Yeah.
**Ken.johnson1**: Somewhere around there.
**Ken.johnson1**: You know the recession from the 08 had still it wrecked Kate Coral.
**Ken.johnson1**: She bought her house for 160000 during like the COVID stuff.
**Ken.johnson1**: It was 500 grand.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Now I have a friend that lives on the south kind of the south end of Cape Coral also and they fortunately survived the.
**Speaker 1**: The hurricanes without really any significant damage.
**Speaker 1**: But very close to them.
**Speaker 1**: It was just wiped out a lot of things there.
**Ken.johnson1**: Yeah.
**Ken.johnson1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So what do you plan to have as a staff on and in the Tampa St.
**Speaker 1**: Pete area?
**Speaker 1**: Well, it'll grow.
**Ken.johnson1**: We have.
**Ken.johnson1**: We just have one superintendent and 1pm currently plus myself.
**Ken.johnson1**: But like we'll get as big as, you know, as big as the work we bring in here.
**Ken.johnson1**: Going there, you know, we just just missed out on a apartment.
**Ken.johnson1**: It was a apartment mixed use with retail on first floor.
**Ken.johnson1**: But it was a post tension building in Tampa and that was where we were going to you know, ramp up things down there.
**Ken.johnson1**: You know I'm friends with a lot of the architect.
**Ken.johnson1**: Well every architect I've ever worked with become a friend of mine.
**Ken.johnson1**: So ODP architects is they have an office in Tampa and he lined us up with that job and we just worked together.
**Ken.johnson1**: Kimich and Smith friends with Justin Kimmich and we're working together with him on several projects.
**Ken.johnson1**: We actually had him get licensed in up here in Ohio, Tennessee and he's doing projects for us in both those states.
**Ken.johnson1**: And so that's the relationships we build and you know, not just image.
**Speaker 1**: Is this his office in Carrollwood area and in Tampa?
**Ken.johnson1**: Yeah, Kimmich and Smith is what they're called because Smith used to be like he was one of the like the guru architects when they were building out Naples and Marco island like his.
**Ken.johnson1**: He designed a lot of those suggestion team with him and he.
**Ken.johnson1**: They were the art like the production architects for the Marina Bay project.
**Ken.johnson1**: I built the first one I did here in Clearwater.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Seems to me that I worked with and I have to look at the, my records again that I worked with Justin.
**Speaker 1**: Justin was designing JMCM on the resume for a developer in St.
**Speaker 1**: Petersburg.
**Speaker 1**: JMC Development, Mike Cheese.
**Speaker 1**: Mike Cheesem is the guy's developer's name.
**Speaker 1**: He did a lot of development and downtown St.
**Speaker 1**: Pete but also up in Clearwater area.
**Speaker 1**: But I was working with him on a 12 story condominium downtown St.
**Speaker 1**: Petersburg which we got.
**Speaker 1**: We did all the pre construction, all the preliminary work to the point that okay, we're ready for to pull a permit and covet hit.
**Speaker 1**: So Cheever decided well he didn't know what the, what the market was going.
**Ken.johnson1**: To be and he was a fool because he'd have made a fortune.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, it just doubled and tripled and whatever else the problem was he didn't have enough, he didn't have enough units in the building.
**Speaker 1**: Downtown St.
**Speaker 1**: Petersburg is awful for underground.
**Speaker 1**: It was going to cost a million dollars for the piling just for the underground and, and downtown.
**Ken.johnson1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Now most of what you see new down there is 20 stories or, or more for condominiums.
**Speaker 1**: But there's enough, enough units then to cover the, the cost of things like that to begin with.
**Speaker 1**: But the 1220 units didn't.
**Speaker 1**: Didn't work.
**Ken.johnson1**: Yep yeah, that I left.
**Ken.johnson1**: You know the other condos I did in Clearwater was for called Ballard Construction Group and they have a project, you know they built another condo in daytona, one in St.
**Ken.johnson1**: Pete and the one in St.
**Ken.johnson1**: Pete that's.
**Ken.johnson1**: It's a small lot but there you go.
**Ken.johnson1**: The 26 stories to get enough units in it to make it work and yeah, the same thing.
**Ken.johnson1**: The foundations expensive.
**Ken.johnson1**: It's hard to believe that limestone there is like 200 over 200ft down.
**Ken.johnson1**: Which is, is crazy I would think.
**Ken.johnson1**: You know you're so close like here on the coast like we were.
**Ken.johnson1**: You go down, you know the Marina Bay.
**Ken.johnson1**: We were.
**Ken.johnson1**: We only ordered like 36 foot piles because you know, on average it was about 20, 25ft down.
**Ken.johnson1**: So they were also trying to be cheap and it ended up costing me during the build.
**Ken.johnson1**: But wow, for St.
**Ken.johnson1**: Pete to be that deep.
**Ken.johnson1**: I was like that's crazy.
**Ken.johnson1**: You know.
**Speaker 1**: Well I guess you can do.
**Speaker 1**: We're mostly sand here.
**Speaker 1**: Yes, you can get some, some friction on piling but on the other hand you don't get any clay or anything like that to, to.
**Speaker 1**: Not very often anyway.
**Speaker 1**: If you do it's just a layer of clay.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Speaker 1**: To help Support the, the piling.
**Speaker 1**: So some of it's real deep.
**Ken.johnson1**: Yep.
**Ken.johnson1**: Yeah.
**Ken.johnson1**: There we were hitting, you know, the limestone.
**Ken.johnson1**: So driving to that.
**Ken.johnson1**: I think on that same peak they were going to do caissons like down to the.
**Ken.johnson1**: Down to the.
**Ken.johnson1**: Until they hit rock.
**Speaker 1**: But so we were at 90ft.
**Speaker 1**: We were having to go 90ft downtown for like just a 12 story building, which is muck.
**Speaker 1**: It's kind of just muck all the way down.
**Ken.johnson1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Anyway, Jesse, you ask about them compensation and I'd be at the top of the.
**Speaker 1**: What you advertise, I guess.
**Speaker 1**: But, but, and, and I'd be.
**Speaker 1**: I'd be working for less.
**Speaker 1**: But on the other hand, I'm, I'm not.
**Speaker 1**: As I said, it's just part of the equation of what I'm looking for.
**Speaker 1**: You're close, you'll be close to home and a.
**Speaker 1**: Most of the time reasonable commute to an office in St.
**Speaker 1**: Pete or Clearwater, wherever over there.
**Speaker 1**: And the travel is not an issue.
**Speaker 1**: And custom to travel.
**Speaker 1**: The travel is not what it used to be for either car or airplane.
**Speaker 1**: But like anything else, plan ahead a little bit.
**Ken.johnson1**: Yeah, Yeah.
**Ken.johnson1**: I think like coming up, Andy, it's a direct flight.
**Ken.johnson1**: So southwest comes up here, makes it pretty easy, but so you'd be at the top end with.
**Ken.johnson1**: At 130 with the other added benefits that come with that.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Ken.johnson1**: Okay.
**Ken.johnson1**: Okay.
**Ken.johnson1**: Well, let me have a conversation with Brandon and.
**Ken.johnson1**: And you're.
**Ken.johnson1**: Is it a two week notice you turn in?
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I could be available pretty quickly.
**Speaker 1**: That's, that's something I would, I would probably need to do.
**Ken.johnson1**: Okay.
**Ken.johnson1**: All right, well, let me.
**Speaker 1**: You have a 502 phone number.
**Speaker 1**: Are you from Louisville?
**Ken.johnson1**: Now I, My sister lives there and okay, me and my daughter got Louisville phone numbers.
**Ken.johnson1**: We were there for a bit ourselves and me and my daughter, we just, we had a number that's one digit apart.
**Ken.johnson1**: We just kept them.
**Ken.johnson1**: So.
**Ken.johnson1**: So I, that's the only good thing is telemarketers.
**Ken.johnson1**: I know if, if it's a 502 number calling me and I don't know it.
**Ken.johnson1**: It's a telemarketer, so.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Ken.johnson1**: It screens my calls for me.
**Ken.johnson1**: Yeah.
**Ken.johnson1**: You got family in Florida or.
**Speaker 1**: Just my wife and I and two dogs.
**Ken.johnson1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: I have a son and grandchildren that live in Nashville.
**Ken.johnson1**: Okay.
**Ken.johnson1**: Well, someday Brandon wants to have an office in Nashville, so to be able to.
**Speaker 1**: It's booming there.
**Ken.johnson1**: It is, it is, yeah.
**Speaker 1**: South west coast of Florida is one of the best areas of the country now for growth.
**Speaker 1**: In 10 years it will look like The East Coast.
**Ken.johnson1**: Yeah, because the east coast, there's nowhere else to build anything and, and they're just, everything's creeping up from the south, from Naples up.
**Ken.johnson1**: It won't be long and.
**Ken.johnson1**: Yeah, there's just nowhere else to go.
**Speaker 1**: Well, it's an awful lot of tear down now.
**Speaker 1**: Some of those old motels on the beach and actually where I've been working is what there was two, two old hotels built the 1950s that were torn down to accommodate this seven story condominium and that's, that's happening all along the west coast now.
**Speaker 1**: I'm not sure what the condominium laws now are going to, how they're going to affect sales of condominiums because of the collapse of the one in, down in Miami, Fort Lauderdale area.
**Ken.johnson1**: Those insurance rates are certainly affecting that.
**Speaker 1**: Well, it is, but also what they have to, what the condo association has to put aside for their long term expectations of maintenance and renovation.
**Ken.johnson1**: Yeah, yeah.
**Ken.johnson1**: What is it, 25% or.
**Speaker 1**: I don't remember exactly what it is, but it's, it's putting, it's putting some of these people who had them, had, had units and 20 year old buildings in jeopardy for being able to pay for whatever the fees are going to be or the, the assessments are going to be.
**Ken.johnson1**: Yep.
**Ken.johnson1**: Yeah, I feel sorry for.
**Ken.johnson1**: And then like all these people then, you know, they got the hurricane damage on their homes and if it's over 50 they gotta bring everything up to code.
**Ken.johnson1**: There's a lot of people.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Ken.johnson1**: Like just can't afford it and then they won't let them go back in their house.
**Ken.johnson1**: Which is crazy.
**Ken.johnson1**: I mean.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, some of that locally over in St.
**Speaker 1**: Pete area.
**Ken.johnson1**: Yeah, all along the beach from Indian Shores.
**Ken.johnson1**: Clear water like, like all around there.
**Ken.johnson1**: Like my friend is a policeman on the Indian Shores Police Department.
**Ken.johnson1**: He's like people like are not happy down there.
**Speaker 1**: So Jesse, if there's anything else, like any more information I can give you, anything else I can provide that you don't already have and I tried to not overload you but give you a good overview of what I know, what I've done, a little bit of who I am and we've discussed a little bit about what I'm looking for.
**Speaker 1**: But I'm interested in the position with you and would ask if you can to, to continue whatever that process is internally for you.
**Speaker 1**: But do you, do you have a date in mind that you, you want to hire by?
**Ken.johnson1**: Well, I need someone today, so I just need to, I need to talk to Brandon and like I can hopefully we can make a decision today.
**Ken.johnson1**: And.
**Ken.johnson1**: And that's why I said, I'll let you know.
**Ken.johnson1**: I'll call you back today and let you know.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: And I'll be happy to meet with you anytime next week or whenever you get back in.
**Speaker 1**: Could be on the weekend, for that matter.
**Speaker 1**: Whenever you get back in.
**Ken.johnson1**: Okay.
**Ken.johnson1**: Yeah, for sure.
**Ken.johnson1**: Because, like, Brandon, he likes to meet people in person, too, but we actually are.
**Ken.johnson1**: And so, like, is there.
**Ken.johnson1**: Let me talk to him, and then I'll call you back.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Ken.johnson1**: And let you know.
**Speaker 1**: All right.
**Speaker 1**: Sorry about my camera.
**Speaker 1**: I had all my makeup on and everything else dressed up and.
**Ken.johnson1**: Yeah, no, no, it's all good.
**Ken.johnson1**: Thanks, Ken.
**Speaker 1**: All right.
**Speaker 1**: Thank you.
**Ken.johnson1**: Appreciate it.
**Ken.johnson1**: Yep.
**Ken.johnson1**: Bye.
