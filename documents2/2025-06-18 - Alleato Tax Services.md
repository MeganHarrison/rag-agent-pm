**Fnjie**: When we initially talked about the audit.
**Fnjie**: But on the call, I have Charlie.
**Fnjie**: Charlie sits also.
**Fnjie**: Our counterpart on the tax side sits in our Orange county office as well, you know, but in general, we cover the entire United States, you know, with, you know, we are not really tied to our physical location.
**Fnjie**: So, you know, the group between us here, we cover quite a bit of construction.
**Fnjie**: And we have, you know, Charlie have a lot of construction client and professional service.
**Fnjie**: So with that, I will just let him introduce himself and just take it from there.
**Chris.gewain**: Yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: Nice to meet you, Brandon.
**Bclymer**: Yes, I've been specialized in tax side, specifically construction.
**Bclymer**: And even further in the tax world, we go down as far as entity type, which is flow throughs and then the owner's business return too.
**Ayman.soliman**: And you basically went to school and they're like, you know, who wants to go be a pilot?
**Ayman.soliman**: You know, who wants to go be a lawyer?
**Ayman.soliman**: Who wants to do boring on boring on boring.
**Ayman.soliman**: I'm your guy.
**Bclymer**: It's a little bit like that.
**Ayman.soliman**: Give me some tax stuff and throw in boring ass construction.
**Ayman.soliman**: I'm there.
**Bclymer**: Exactly.
**Bclymer**: It's more like, I don't know what else to do.
**Bclymer**: And why is everyone getting F's in my accounting class?
**Bclymer**: And why am I getting A's?
**Bclymer**: I guess I have to do this.
**Chris.gewain**: That's what I did.
**Ayman.soliman**: Spreadsheets.
**Ayman.soliman**: Love me.
**Bclymer**: Exactly, exactly.
**Bclymer**: And it's all the, all the addresses on there.
**Bclymer**: Some from the Midwest too, from Nebraska.
**Bclymer**: I saw there's Carmel, Indiana on there.
**Bclymer**: And Then I see Tampa, which is funny because my girlfriend's family, it's from Carmel, and they just moved to Tampa last year.
**Ayman.soliman**: Oh, no, it's Our.
**Ayman.soliman**: Our coo, Jesse, is from Nebraska, so.
**Bclymer**: Oh, that's funny.
**Ayman.soliman**: There you go.
**Bclymer**: We got a couple of connections there, so that's awesome.
**Bclymer**: But, yeah, but.
**Chris.gewain**: So, yeah.
**Ayman.soliman**: So basically, what I understand.
**Ayman.soliman**: So, you know, Justin, you know, acts as our cfo, and, you know, he recommended you guys for construction.
**Ayman.soliman**: We use CBIZ right now.
**Ayman.soliman**: I mean, they're literally.
**Ayman.soliman**: I just got a freeze on my damn account because something up with my returns in 23.
**Ayman.soliman**: Right.
**Ayman.soliman**: Like, just annoying, you know, and so, anyway, so we're dropping them, you know, so, you know, I.
**Ayman.soliman**: I kind of put my trust in, you know, as far as the, you know, the Alito tax stuff.
**Ayman.soliman**: I mean, we just literally used, you know, cbiz, which used to be.
**Ayman.soliman**: I can't remember.
**Ayman.soliman**: They bought whatever company it was, but just because I had used them with another company that I owned and, you know, whenever you start a company, at least me, probably most founders like, oh, who's gonna be my tax advisor?
**Ayman.soliman**: Is the last fucking thing they're thinking about because it's like, I don't have anything to tax.
**Ayman.soliman**: I'm not making any money yet.
**Ayman.soliman**: And then all of a sudden, you start making money, and it's like, hey, what the fuck?
**Ayman.soliman**: Like, I don't like paying half my shit away.
**Ayman.soliman**: So.
**Ayman.soliman**: Yeah.
**Ayman.soliman**: So, I mean, you know, we've already filed for extension.
**Ayman.soliman**: I know.
**Ayman.soliman**: You know, Justin talking about we need to do, like, quarterly stuff, you know, a lot of that.
**Ayman.soliman**: Like, I don't really know, but, I mean, you know, I.
**Ayman.soliman**: I don't.
**Ayman.soliman**: I don't know enough to sit here and interview you guys and say, oh, well, you know, you've gotta do this.
**Justin**: That.
**Ayman.soliman**: The other.
**Ayman.soliman**: Like, this is.
**Ayman.soliman**: That's not my forte.
**Ayman.soliman**: That's, you know, what I pay Justin for.
**Ayman.soliman**: So I kind of trust him on that.
**Ayman.soliman**: So I don't want to sit here and go through how you.
**Ayman.soliman**: How you make the.
**Ayman.soliman**: The cake, because I don't care.
**Ayman.soliman**: You know, What I care about is the result, you know, which is something that tastes good that I don't have to deal with.
**Ayman.soliman**: So, you know, I'm.
**Ayman.soliman**: I'm pretty on board for you guys doing Alito's stuff, you know, especially because you guys obviously do construction.
**Ayman.soliman**: Justin recommends you.
**Ayman.soliman**: You know, I'm not going to go around and interview people.
**Ayman.soliman**: Like, I actually know what the I'm doing, so.
**Chris.gewain**: Yeah.
**Chris.gewain**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Go ahead, Justin.
**Mcalcetero**: Good morning, everyone.
**Mcalcetero**: By the way, Sorry, I'm traveling in and out.
**Mcalcetero**: You can get a small video preview of me, but I'm about to hop in my car.
**Mcalcetero**: The.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, Brandon's a great guy.
**Mcalcetero**: Alito is a growing commercial DC that's doing some really, really cool things.
**Mcalcetero**: I think just the personalities at Moss Brandon are really good personalities.
**Mcalcetero**: They understand business owners and they don't just give minutia tax stuff.
**Mcalcetero**: So it was good to put face to face together.
**Mcalcetero**: But yeah, Moss is a great, great company, so that's why I brought you guys together.
**Mcalcetero**: And all we need, not all we need, but really what we need is to look at.
**Mcalcetero**: Look at the business from a quarterly standpoint where, you know, we're.
**Mcalcetero**: We're updating WIPs, we're looking at financials.
**Mcalcetero**: We want to give that to the, to the tax planner and tax preparer so we can take a look at, you know, where the ship is heading as far as tax obligations are going to.
**Mcalcetero**: And we can give you guys, you know, that data and make decisions.
**Mcalcetero**: And then also the cherry on top, which we'll love, is, you know, what, what tax strategies can we potentially explore for Brandon as far as Alito goes and, you know, R and D tax credits, blah, blah.
**Mcalcetero**: Things that you guys are really good at figuring out based on looking at the business, its operations and what it does.
**Mcalcetero**: And then Brandon has a lot going on, honestly, to my surprise too.
**Mcalcetero**: Like, I thought Alito was his not only thing, but he.
**Mcalcetero**: There's a lot going on personally as well.
**Mcalcetero**: He's invested in multiple companies.
**Mcalcetero**: There's.
**Mcalcetero**: I think Moss can grow with them.
**Mcalcetero**: And once you guys show your capabilities of what you can do and what the service looks like, there's a lot of opportunity to really help Brandon holistically on all this tax stuff.
**Ayman.soliman**: So one thing, one thing with, with us, and I'm not sure if you guys do this like.
**Ayman.soliman**: So, for instance, you know, we've got, you know, a few different developments, like one development that, you know, we're working on closing.
**Ayman.soliman**: It's.
**Ayman.soliman**: It'll be like 1.2 billion or so down at Fort Myers.
**Ayman.soliman**: And, and I'll be a 20 stakeholder in that.
**Ayman.soliman**: So I, you know, I like different developments.
**Ayman.soliman**: Like we got a $40 million hotel down in Savannah that, you know, I'll be 20 to 25% stakeholder in that and, you know, a few other, like a few other different ones.
**Ayman.soliman**: And so that, you know, I don't know how that equates, like, I don't want to own any of that stuff through Alito because I want to shield that, you know, so I own it all through my personal.
**Ayman.soliman**: And that are, you know, I have to set up different entities for each one or whatever that looks like.
**Ayman.soliman**: But that's one thing, you know, to look at, which I guess technically does all just come through as K1s, but I don't know.
**Ayman.soliman**: I don't know how that works on the tax side or what options there are.
**Justin**: Yeah, Justin.
**Justin**: Justin, do you know, you just.
**Justin**: From a scoping perspective, some of these.
**Justin**: Obviously there's the Alito entity, and then there's some of these and other investments.
**Justin**: That sounds like there's other entities set up.
**Justin**: And then obviously Brandon's personal return.
**Justin**: What's the.
**Justin**: Maybe we get our hands around what's the full scope of the tax work that would be helpful, probably for Charlie.
**Ayman.soliman**: The main thing that for you guys is.
**Ayman.soliman**: Is elite.
**Mcalcetero**: Like.
**Ayman.soliman**: Like, all right, like I told Justin, like, let's start with just the elite overturn, because most all my other stuff, like I have a piece of the solar company, like, you know, any of these kind of developments, all that stuff typically comes through just as K1s.
**Justin**: Sure.
**Ayman.soliman**: You know, but so Alito is where I want to start.
**Ayman.soliman**: And, you know, I want to crawl before we walk and, you know, walk before we run.
**Ayman.soliman**: And so that's the.
**Ayman.soliman**: The biggest one I want to start with.
**Ayman.soliman**: And then, you know, as we.
**Ayman.soliman**: As we grow and say, all right, hey, here's what else we got going on, and if there's, you know, value and we bring it into the rest, then we can do that a bit.
**Ayman.soliman**: I mean, like, off top of my head, I own pieces and parts of, I don't know, four or five companies, and then, you know, apartment buildings and real estate, stuff like that.
**Justin**: And Charlie, you could chime in, I think the trickle, the trick will be a little bit.
**Justin**: Right.
**Justin**: Brandon, as you mentioned, things are all flowing to you personally, right, through the K1s, right.
**Justin**: Even Alito.
**Justin**: And so some of the things that we recommend.
**Justin**: Right.
**Justin**: We want to make sure you can utilize at the personal level.
**Justin**: Right.
**Justin**: And so it flows through, and we want to make sure you have things like basis and whatnot.
**Justin**: So on the planning, we'd have to.
**Justin**: We'd want to make sure it kind of flows through to you personally, so things that we're recommending you can actually utilize.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah.
**Mcalcetero**: And I will say my game plan with Brandon has been to start to organize his data, like having a personal balance sheet and a cap table, what he owns and what percentage, which I'm waiting on Maria for I probably have follow up with their.
**Mcalcetero**: Brandon, but we'll, we'll, we'll get that figured out and then their associated tax returns and provide that as soon as we can in order for you guys to understand the total pickup.
**Justin**: Yeah, because I think ultimately the value, right.
**Justin**: If we kind of take a step back, the value is not going to be having us help you with preparing a return.
**Justin**: The value is going to be ultimately saving you money at the personal level.
**Justin**: Right.
**Justin**: That's where, that's where you're at the end of the day, you're going to be happy with, you know, when you eat that cake right at the end of the year that you mentioned.
**Justin**: So I think that's, you know, Charlie does a really good job with this with the other owners that we work with.
**Justin**: The year end tax planning meetings.
**Justin**: Right.
**Justin**: Hey, if we make these decisions before the end of the year, you know, we can save you X amount of dollars in tax or we can defer tax potentially to a future period.
**Justin**: Right.
**Justin**: Which is also a good answer.
**Justin**: So all those sorts of things we'd want to make sure we're, we kind of hand have our hands around.
**Mcalcetero**: At.
**Justin**: Your personal level because they all, they all flow into you.
**Justin**: Right?
**Ayman.soliman**: Right.
**Ayman.soliman**: Yeah, I mean that's, you know, that's one thing, you know, that, you know, we kind of talked a little bit, I think with Justin.
**Ayman.soliman**: Stuff like I don't know what we'll make this year.
**Ayman.soliman**: Let's say it's, I don't know, 3 or 4 million, maybe 2.
**Ayman.soliman**: Let's just say it's.
**Ayman.soliman**: Well, let's say it's 1.5, whatever, 2.
**Ayman.soliman**: I don't want to pay a million dollars in taxes.
**Ayman.soliman**: So you know, I don't know if that's all right.
**Ayman.soliman**: Like, you know, because I can only buy so many trucks.
**Ayman.soliman**: Like I would just, you know, I don't want to just buy to buy shit.
**Ayman.soliman**: But like.
**Ayman.soliman**: All right, well what do we do?
**Ayman.soliman**: Like, do I need to like, you know, buy some just ground, you know, to say that we're going to build on like things like that, that, that I can, you know, buy through Alito to, to, to shield some of that or whatever.
**Ayman.soliman**: Like how, you know, I don't know how that works because once it obviously passes from Alito to me, then it's, you know, taxable event versus even, you know, unless I have real estate that I'd appreciate and all that stuff.
**Ayman.soliman**: But if it's a direct line expense, which that's where, I don't know, can I buy a building or something like that and have it as a full expense line item.
**Ayman.soliman**: Cause it's for business.
**Chris.gewain**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And that's where these tax kind of quarterly planning meetings come in, where we just.
**Bclymer**: My job is just to give you ideas and things.
**Bclymer**: Hey, there's these five ideas.
**Bclymer**: I think two or maybe or next year two you could act right now.
**Bclymer**: One's a little risky.
**Bclymer**: What's your thoughts on them?
**Bclymer**: And we give you the ideas of what to pull the trigger on.
**Bclymer**: That's.
**Bclymer**: That's really where I come in, is give you ideas and then make sure you're not.
**Bclymer**: You don't have any headaches with the irs, DFT or the state of Indiana or anyone like that.
**Bclymer**: That's.
**Bclymer**: That's really what my job is to be doing here.
**Chris.gewain**: Yeah.
**Ayman.soliman**: I mean, my big thing with when I come to taxes is like, you know, there's a line of like, okay, this is a fine.
**Ayman.soliman**: This is prison.
**Ayman.soliman**: I want to be about right here, like just on the like, oh, you owe $100,000 because you did this.
**Ayman.soliman**: Okay, that's fine.
**Ayman.soliman**: 10 years in prison.
**Ayman.soliman**: Not my game.
**Chris.gewain**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And we don't want anything to get us in trouble too.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I think we're real concerned about that too.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And I think right.
**Bclymer**: This year is going to be an interesting year too, with this new tax bill that's coming around.
**Bclymer**: There could be some really good things in it.
**Bclymer**: So, you know, our firm of our size, he had done big, beautiful tax bill.
**Bclymer**: So we, we had someone feeding us all the information and how it works.
**Bclymer**: So we can execute weapons pretty much.
**Bclymer**: So you can actually make decisions quickly on new information when there's thousands of pages of, you know, tax bills where maybe some other firms built and it takes them at least a year or two to understand.
**Ayman.soliman**: So if that passes, you know, whatever effort goes through all this shit, would that be for 2025 or would it start in 2026?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, so it just depends on what the items are.
**Bclymer**: Like for instance, bonus depreciation, if you're familiar with that, the 100% write off of fixed assets.
**Bclymer**: So that in the proposed bill, it's basically any asset placed in service after like January 19, 2025.
**Bclymer**: So that's would be in place for 2025 taxes.
**Ayman.soliman**: And that's basically like didn't Trump in his first term came out with that to where if I bought a piece of equipment instead of depreciating it, whatever it is, over seven years, I can do 100% depreciation year one.
**Ayman.soliman**: That's what you're Talking about.
**Ayman.soliman**: Correct?
**Bclymer**: Exactly.
**Chris.gewain**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And they're proposing to make it permanent.
**Bclymer**: So it doesn't, the law doesn't change in five years from now.
**Bclymer**: And then there's some favorable interest rules, for example, where the last couple years has been limited based on this calculation, but now they change that calculation so it's more favorable to taxpayers.
**Ayman.soliman**: So let me ask you this real quick.
**Ayman.soliman**: And we're going to get off probably what this meeting used to be.
**Ayman.soliman**: But just bear with me if you would.
**Ayman.soliman**: So the biggest thing in our world is miscommunication, misinformation.
**Ayman.soliman**: Like, you know, you have a zillion influencers saying whatever they want, people believe them.
**Ayman.soliman**: So one thing like to look at like, all right, well how do you, whenever things transfer, like how do you shield your income?
**Ayman.soliman**: So like for instance, you know, starting a company like watches, right?
**Ayman.soliman**: I like watches.
**Ayman.soliman**: Say I bought a, or I started a company that is a watch dealer, right?
**Ayman.soliman**: And then so then I have to buy inventory for that and you know, it just doesn't make money for two years and then it shuts down.
**Ayman.soliman**: I would just do it again, blah, blah, blah.
**Ayman.soliman**: That's things that you hear about or like maybe you did it with, you know, luxury cars or whatever these other different things are, but you show losses essentially and then that goes against your total taxable income.
**Ayman.soliman**: Is that a real thing or is that just somebody saying shit online?
**Bclymer**: Somebody's saying shit online, yeah, it's partial truth.
**Bclymer**: Because the issue that you run into, because I hear this all the time, it's like, hey, let's say Alito has a million dollars of income.
**Bclymer**: It goes, oh, go buy a gas station.
**Bclymer**: You can write it off for a million dollars.
**Bclymer**: That is true, you can write it off for a million dollars.
**Bclymer**: But what happens is there's these certain rules that say, hey, you have to materially participate in them, meaning to have at least like 750 hours in the year in this entity or in this business, which it's kind of hard to do if you have a full time job.
**Bclymer**: But if your job was gas stations, yeah, for sure that would work.
**Bclymer**: But yeah, you kind of see those, that misinformation of that, how the rules are applied.
**Bclymer**: So it is kind of partial truth.
**Bclymer**: But there could, there is some truths there on just like some real estate plays.
**Bclymer**: Like if you have a bunch of real estate income and you do make another real estate purchase, you could potentially offset some of that real estate income.
**Bclymer**: There's just a lot of different hurdles and rules to follow that that are missed in some of Those in this social media.
**Ayman.soliman**: If I bought.
**Ayman.soliman**: If I bought a, let's say a drywall company, right.
**Ayman.soliman**: Like, you know, that feeds into me.
**Ayman.soliman**: Like, even if I just, you know, absorb it into my umbrella or however that looks like, I guess it has to be the same entity, right?
**Ayman.soliman**: Like same.
**Bclymer**: Same business.
**Bclymer**: Same business per se.
**Bclymer**: So the drywall company would, I would say, falls in the same business as Alito.
**Bclymer**: So that would work.
**Bclymer**: But also like, so you purchasing a business for it.
**Bclymer**: Say you outlay a million dollars.
**Bclymer**: Well, you just bought it for a million dollars.
**Bclymer**: There's no actual expense yet until you.
**Bclymer**: So what are you going to do with that?
**Bclymer**: A million dollars at the business?
**Bclymer**: Are you going to.
**Bclymer**: Are you going to depreciate something?
**Bclymer**: Are you going to pay people?
**Ayman.soliman**: I would think that that million dollars that I took from could be taxable income.
**Ayman.soliman**: I'm giving it to the guy I'm buying it from.
**Ayman.soliman**: And so that's gone.
**Ayman.soliman**: Right.
**Ayman.soliman**: Just like if I bought a car.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: When you buy businesses, it's a little different.
**Bclymer**: Sometimes it depends on the assets you're buying, for instance.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Sound like you get a million dollar deduction.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, you get kind of goodwill.
**Mcalcetero**: Takes like 15 years.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, typically it takes 15 years.
**Bclymer**: Unless.
**Bclymer**: Unless you are buying a car business or you're essentially buying inventory.
**Bclymer**: You take that over maybe five years.
**Bclymer**: So just there's a lot of facts and circumstances and different scenarios.
**Bclymer**: But I think, bigger picture, what we want to do is say, hey, here's.
**Bclymer**: Here's where you're at today.
**Bclymer**: We have two months till the end of the year, whatever time frame.
**Bclymer**: Here's how much cash is on the sideline.
**Bclymer**: Here's what you actually want to do to grow your business.
**Bclymer**: Put it.
**Bclymer**: Let's put tax away for a little bit.
**Bclymer**: These are things that can help grow your business and also save you taxes.
**Bclymer**: That's what.
**Bclymer**: That's what we want to do, and that's the goal.
**Mcalcetero**: The best business you can build, Brandon, is if you're passionate about something charitable or whatever you want to do.
**Mcalcetero**: Dude.
**Mcalcetero**: Or if you're just a piece of shit.
**Mcalcetero**: Because I've seen pieces of shits do things with nonprofits.
**Mcalcetero**: That's where you can really put money somewhere and then.
**Mcalcetero**: And then put it towards a good cause, hopefully, you know.
**Ayman.soliman**: Yeah, I mean, we do.
**Ayman.soliman**: I mean, we do a lot of that, like goodwill, right.
**Mcalcetero**: So, like, well, you can have control.
**Ayman.soliman**: Right.
**Ayman.soliman**: Then you're.
**Ayman.soliman**: Oh, okay.
**Ayman.soliman**: I was gonna say, I was like, I, hell, I don't have time to start nonprofit.
**Ayman.soliman**: Be honest.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, well, Are you.
**Mcalcetero**: I'm just.
**Mcalcetero**: I'm just.
**Bclymer**: I was going to say if.
**Chris.gewain**: If you.
**Bclymer**: Are you involved in some real estate, it sounds like the real estate deals.
**Bclymer**: So if you're ever about to exit those, too, there's.
**Bclymer**: There's a lot of really cool things you can do with those, like put aside the 1031 exchanges and not defer that.
**Bclymer**: But there's also, in the proposed tax bill, there's opportunity zones may get extended where you can essentially maybe permanently defer some.
**Bclymer**: Some of the gain.
**Bclymer**: So there's a lot you can do in the real estate world as well.
**Ayman.soliman**: Yep.
**Ayman.soliman**: Perfect.
**Justin**: Hey, Brandon, you mentioned.
**Justin**: To start, you mentioned your prior cpa, you had some.
**Justin**: Something was frozen.
**Fnjie**: What.
**Justin**: Maybe you can elaborate what was going on with that?
**Ayman.soliman**: So my.
**Ayman.soliman**: So we.
**Ayman.soliman**: They originally, like, did my returns and it came back and I was like, what the fuck is this?
**Ayman.soliman**: Well, they had, like.
**Ayman.soliman**: Like, we have, like, deposits for certain jobs that they were calling as revenue, profit.
**Ayman.soliman**: And so it was skewing our numbers.
**Ayman.soliman**: Right.
**Ayman.soliman**: And so thank God caught that, you know.
**Ayman.soliman**: And so they had to amend the return.
**Ayman.soliman**: When they amended the return, you know, we missed the deadline.
**Ayman.soliman**: You know, that's fine.
**Ayman.soliman**: I was like, I'm not going to cut a check and go try to get my money back.
**Ayman.soliman**: And so amended the return, you know, and then I think, you know, by the time we got amended, it was like January, you know, this is for 23, so it'll be like January this year or whatever.
**Ayman.soliman**: And so we send in the numbers.
**Ayman.soliman**: What they told me was that with the amended return, I wouldn't have any personal tax obligations.
**Ayman.soliman**: Well, the state, I guess, didn't process it, didn't figure it out or, like, it's still.
**Ayman.soliman**: I don't know what the deal is.
**Ayman.soliman**: But yesterday, you know, I.
**Ayman.soliman**: All of a sudden, I look.
**Ayman.soliman**: And my personal account was levied by, like, I don't know, 20.
**Ayman.soliman**: Some odd thousand dollars.
**Ayman.soliman**: You know, and so, you know, that's.
**Ayman.soliman**: That's the issue.
**Ayman.soliman**: Like.
**Ayman.soliman**: And so I'm hitting up cbiz.
**Ayman.soliman**: Like, what the.
**Ayman.soliman**: Get this figured out.
**Ayman.soliman**: You know, like, I.
**Ayman.soliman**: You know, I got a levy now I gotta move money.
**Ayman.soliman**: And, you know, how do we make sure this gets amended?
**Ayman.soliman**: So just.
**Ayman.soliman**: That's the thing.
**Ayman.soliman**: It's just annoying.
**Ayman.soliman**: It shouldn't be happening.
**Ayman.soliman**: Like, I literally.
**Ayman.soliman**: I gave them power of attorney.
**Ayman.soliman**: Like, it's like, yeah, what the.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, it's a pain dealing with.
**Bclymer**: Actually, the states are almost more of a pain than the IRS these days, too.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Ayman.soliman**: Yeah, that's the thing.
**Ayman.soliman**: I mean, again, it's not a, you know, it's whatever, 22, three, $4,000, whatever.
**Ayman.soliman**: It's not the end of the world.
**Ayman.soliman**: It's just annoying that it happened in the first place.
**Chris.gewain**: Sure.
**Chris.gewain**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So where does the other CPA firm at in terms of 2024 taxes?
**Bclymer**: You said you guys got an extension?
**Ayman.soliman**: Yeah, that's it.
**Ayman.soliman**: We just files an extension, you know, whenever that happens.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And did you make any personal extensions on your personal return?
**Bclymer**: You did?
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Ayman.soliman**: Extension for both?
**Chris.gewain**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Okay, that's good.
**Bclymer**: And are the books for 24?
**Ayman.soliman**: What was that?
**Bclymer**: Are the books all final then?
**Bclymer**: I know we got the Excel financials.
**Bclymer**: Are those final then or 24?
**Ayman.soliman**: I believe so, Fatima.
**Chris.gewain**: Okay.
**Ayman.soliman**: Yes, they are.
**Chris.gewain**: Okay.
**Mcalcetero**: I need to do a final review on them, but yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Ayman.soliman**: So, yeah, so I guess probably send me an engagement letter or whatever it is that you guys need and, you know, go from there and, you know, if you want to, you know, obviously keep Justin on communication and, you know, things that whatever you need or whatever the next steps are.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah.
**Mcalcetero**: Can you guys hear me, by the way, or am I talking to myself?
**Mcalcetero**: Hello?
**Ayman.soliman**: We're just ignoring you.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay, good, good.
**Mcalcetero**: I'm.
**Mcalcetero**: I'm used to that at home, so this is good.
**Mcalcetero**: What's it called, Charlie?
**Mcalcetero**: If you can send us.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, just.
**Mcalcetero**: Just an engagement letter.
**Mcalcetero**: And also what kind of a preliminary document, Charlie?
**Mcalcetero**: For what?
**Mcalcetero**: We're going to need to make a request from Brandon and his assistant Maria as far as prior tax returns, needed documents on his personal side in order for us to give him the best tax strategy possible.
**Mcalcetero**: All his K1 blah, blah.
**Mcalcetero**: If you can just put that in an organized request list and then we can get Maria going and get you guys all the documentation you need in order to one scope it properly to understand where we can bring tax benefit to Brandon and really be of value for him.
**Mcalcetero**: I know we're doing Alito returns right now, but still, I understand where you guys are coming from.
**Mcalcetero**: They're all pass throughs at the end of the day, so.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, yeah, if we can start there.
**Chris.gewain**: That would be great.
**Mcalcetero**: And then anything else you guys need, you.
**Mcalcetero**: You let us know via an email and then me, Fatima and everyone will work on it.
**Bclymer**: That sounds great.
**Ayman.soliman**: Sounds good.
**Mcalcetero**: We're now Loom, by the way, guys, I don't know if you guys saw that, but we're officially rebranded.
**Bclymer**: Oh, oh, I see the background now.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, our domain's gonna change.
**Mcalcetero**: You guys will get an email, but.
**Chris.gewain**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: We had the rebrand too, so we're Baker Tilly.
**Bclymer**: With Moss Adams.
**Chris.gewain**: Yeah.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, man, those acquisitions are going like crazy.
**Mcalcetero**: I had a CPA firm.
**Mcalcetero**: Seriously poach me trying to buy the firm.
**Mcalcetero**: Like, dude, I just bought this thing.
**Mcalcetero**: These CPA firms are hungry right now.
**Mcalcetero**: What's going on?
**Justin**: I think private equity.
**Justin**: A lot of private equity money out there right now.
**Mcalcetero**: I think I know, but I feel like there's a lot less than there was.
**Mcalcetero**: But I guess I'm wrong, huh?
**Mcalcetero**: Because like cost of borrowing and all that, but they.
**Mcalcetero**: They're eating these.
**Mcalcetero**: These firms up.
**Mcalcetero**: How do you guys feel about the whole Baker Tilly thing?
**Mcalcetero**: You guys excited?
**Mcalcetero**: Not excited.
**Justin**: I'm excited.
**Justin**: It's.
**Justin**: I think it's exciting.
**Justin**: We're gonna have a national footprint.
**Justin**: Offices in every state.
**Justin**: I'm in almost every state now.
**Justin**: So.
**Justin**: Yeah, I mean we're going to be the.
**Justin**: The premier, premier firm, I think in the construction space for privately health companies.
**Justin**: So it's gonna be great for us.
**Mcalcetero**: That is, that is actually true.
**Chris.gewain**: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: We have offices in Indian and Tampa now too.
**Bclymer**: So that helps us out.
**Bclymer**: So when you need boots in the ground or need to come out there.
**Bclymer**: I'm in Orange County.
**Mcalcetero**: Orange County.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay.
**Justin**: And Charlie.
**Justin**: Justin.
**Justin**: Charlie.
**Justin**: Charlie toggles back and forth between Orange county and San Diego.
**Justin**: So I know you're.
**Justin**: You know, based on where you're at, it might make sense for you guys to grab lunch whenever you're in town.
**Bclymer**: Of course.
**Mcalcetero**: Hopefully Charlie.
**Mcalcetero**: Hopefully Charlie refers me some business, cuz.
**Mcalcetero**: Chris, stop.
**Mcalcetero**: Dude, I'm.
**Ayman.soliman**: Hey guys.
**Ayman.soliman**: Anything else for me?
**Ayman.soliman**: I gotta jump in this 1130.
**Mcalcetero**: No, no, Brandon, a bunch of CPA's shooting the shit.
**Ayman.soliman**: Thanks.
**Mcalcetero**: Hey, buddy.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, Charlie, let's grab some lunch, man.
**Mcalcetero**: For sure.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, that sounds great.
**Mcalcetero**: I'll email you outside of this.
**Mcalcetero**: Chris Amon.
**Mcalcetero**: You guys doing good?
**Justin**: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Mcalcetero**: Family good.
**Mcalcetero**: Everyone good?
**Fnjie**: Oh, good here.
**Fnjie**: How was your newborn?
**Fnjie**: I think you.
**Fnjie**: What, like three months now?
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, yeah, newborns.
**Mcalcetero**: Newborns growing very fast and it's crazy.
**Mcalcetero**: And yeah, it's.
**Mcalcetero**: I'm good.
**Mcalcetero**: I'm good.
**Mcalcetero**: Tired a little bit, but trying to.
**Mcalcetero**: Trying to get through it.
**Mcalcetero**: Otherwise.
**Chris.gewain**: Good.
**Mcalcetero**: Hey, I have.
**Mcalcetero**: I have another tax referral for you guys too.
**Mcalcetero**: Mid market.
**Mcalcetero**: Commercial.
**Mcalcetero**: I shouldn't say mid market.
**Mcalcetero**: Smaller.
**Mcalcetero**: Like 30, 40 million commercial GC.
**Mcalcetero**: I'll make an introduction in a few days.
**Mcalcetero**: He's.
**Mcalcetero**: He's adamant on me giving like a fee range, which already scares me.
**Mcalcetero**: So I'm gonna smell him out a little further to see if he's a bullshitter or not and what.
**Mcalcetero**: What his deal is.
**Mcalcetero**: Brandon, by the way Brandon's cool, he actually sees value in value, if you know what I mean.
**Mcalcetero**: He's not like.
**Mcalcetero**: He's not the type that says, you know, I don't want to pay any taxes ever.
**Mcalcetero**: His firefly is listening to me, too, so at least he knows I talk good behind his back.
**Mcalcetero**: But he.
**Mcalcetero**: He sees that.
**Mcalcetero**: He sees.
**Mcalcetero**: He understands taxes need to be paid and you got to do it.
**Mcalcetero**: But he wants to know what strategy there is and everything, so I think it'll be a great fit.
**Mcalcetero**: I enjoy working with them.
**Mcalcetero**: He's.
**Mcalcetero**: He's definitely.
**Mcalcetero**: He's definitely firm but fair.
**Mcalcetero**: So I look forward to working with you guys through this account.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah.
**Justin**: Sounds good, Joe.
**Justin**: So, yeah, we'll.
**Justin**: We'll definitely keep our ears open.
**Justin**: This is after.
**Justin**: Now we're outside of our traditional busy season.
**Justin**: Well, as we start to get opportunities, there's a lot of times where we.
**Justin**: We actually.
**Justin**: And Charlie and I actually may have one for another.
**Justin**: Another prospect.
**Justin**: We just picked up that many.
**Justin**: The little of your help.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, Chris.
**Justin**: Yeah, I think it's out of Long beach, so we're trying to.
**Mcalcetero**: We just got brought in.
**Justin**: We're trying to gauge their accounting skill set, but it's.
**Justin**: Yeah, they're one of those emerging companies that, you know, may need a little TLC to get.
**Justin**: Get off the ground.
**Chris.gewain**: Sure.
**Mcalcetero**: Awesome, man.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, I appreciate that.
**Mcalcetero**: I.
**Mcalcetero**: I've been the worst person, like, I'm speaking with.
**Mcalcetero**: I hired a coach for my business, and he's like, oh, how do you get all your business?
**Mcalcetero**: I'm like, oh, like, through paid, through social, through, like, blah, blah.
**Mcalcetero**: He's like, do you ask people for referrals?
**Mcalcetero**: I'm like, no, I don't.
**Mcalcetero**: He's like, do you refer a lot?
**Mcalcetero**: I'm like, yeah, I do.
**Mcalcetero**: He's like, yeah, we should probably change that.
**Mcalcetero**: You should ask your clients in here cois, like, touch base and.
**Mcalcetero**: And ask them for referrals.
**Mcalcetero**: I'm like, okay, I'll start doing it here and there.
**Mcalcetero**: So.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, but I appreciate that, Chris.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, no pressure, man.
**Mcalcetero**: If anything comes around and it's a good fit for us, we'd love to talk to him.
**Justin**: Yeah, no, I think.
**Justin**: I think you guys, especially when we identify a situation where we.
**Justin**: We get, like, the statements coming over and the whip doesn't tie to the trial balance or something like that, that's usually, for us, a good opportunity.
**Justin**: Hey, let's.
**Justin**: Let's get you guys in there to clean things up before we go in there and rack up a bunch of fees and the client gets annoyed.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, yeah, exactly.
**Mcalcetero**: Or generally, you know, if they're not able to put together an accurate financial together.
**Mcalcetero**: Or whips messed up, or they're having job costing issues, they don't know what's going on with the system, or they're frustrated with their, you know, niece who's a controller, and you're like, hey, we're happy to come in and help you guys and make you guys look good, too.
**Mcalcetero**: So I appreciate you thinking about us, buddy.
**Mcalcetero**: Alrighty.
**Mcalcetero**: Well, I'm gonna.
**Mcalcetero**: I'm gonna hop out here, got my second meeting.
**Mcalcetero**: I'm three minutes later, ready.
**Mcalcetero**: But I appreciate you guys, and we'll chat soon.
**Mcalcetero**: Amon.
**Mcalcetero**: Chris, good to see you.
**Mcalcetero**: Charlie, good to meet you.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, nice to meet you as well.
**Justin**: Take care.
**Bclymer**: Take care, everyone.
**Ayman.soliman**: Sa.
