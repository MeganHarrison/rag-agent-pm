## Transcript

**Maria Calcetero:**
Hey, good morning. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Morning. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
How are you doing? 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Well, how are you? 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Good. So question to you. Just send me something for captive follow up and I open the questionnaire. But what is this for? Like is that for the other accounts or. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
It's insurance. So we're looking at a basically doing self. It's called self insured policy. And so they have the instructions in that email about, you know, the documents that they need for our insurance. And so just like I said, make sure that you don't upload anything that says how much our premium is. And again, when you, when you compile everything, if you want me to look at it, I will. And if, you know, if I got to edit documents or something to hide our premium, then I will do that. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Yeah. So I think I need, because I have it open here. So I think I need some, some help from Fatima in accounting. So yeah, current year is revenue, payroll, expense, number of independent contractors. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
So yeah, I would expect that we have all that stuff saved somewhere. If we don't, then we need to get it and save it in our documents. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Okay. And then it says, yeah, workers monetization. We do have this current year premium. You don't want that current year you're optimal. Okay, I'll check these and then I'll fill it out and then I'll let you know obviously send it to you just for that. Okay. So thank you for that. Ashley already purchased everything for next week, so that's good. So she can help you guys with the charity event that you guys have for. With Will. So that's awesome. We have. I need to call California today. We were supposed to expect an email yesterday probably because of the holidays, but today it's two weeks exactly. So. And we haven't received anything. So I'm just going to call them. Georgia already sent out everything. We're just waiting on their comments for the amendment. I need to follow up with you and Luke regarding, regarding the transportation you guys want from. If you guys want from your house to the event, please follow up with. I think it's Mike, the guy that you want to go with the Ryder cup because I need to purchase their transfero, you know, from the airport to the house in VRBO on Virgo. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
What do you, what do you need from Mike? 

**Maria Calcetero:**
So one second here. I think it's not Mike. So you said you don't want Mike to go or. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
No. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
What was the other Paul. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
I'm working on replacing Paul. Do you know. So we booked his flight. Are you able to go in there and cancel it? Do you know, don't. I'm not saying do that yet, but I just don't know if we have. If we have. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
I think we did. I think we did. Purchase refundable. Yeah, I think I. Yeah, I know. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
We bought this flight. What I'm asking is like, do you have the ability to go in and cancel it so we get refunded or not? 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Yeah, we can. You can definitely go cancel it or ask for the double. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Double check that. Don't do it. But just double check to make sure we can. I'm not sure. I'm so sure we can, but this. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Is if this is. Yeah. Since we purchased a business class. So this is. This is American. Yes, American Airlines business class. Yeah. With the AA business class. We can. I can call them just to make sure I know that we can do it. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
The reason I'm not so sure you can do it is so sometimes like when you buy a flight for somebody else, they're like, oh, you. They have like, you can't cancel it. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
So. Okay, so I'll check. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah, just double check. Because I just want to know what. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Our options are because so far we have Mike and Paul and then if you want the other guy to go, just let me know so we can purchase the flight. And I will need to purchase the transportation from the airport to the house. And then other than that, so working with Ashley in notion as well, so she can also feel more comfortable with databases and everything. So helping her with that. I already removed the people that we are receiving from the website from the form submission that leads that are not relevant to us. So I already removed that. Other than that, I don't think I need anything else from you. You already give me Jim's credit card and everything and then. Yeah, just Justin asked or the organizational businesses. So once you have that, let me know so we can send it out and. Yeah, that's it. Do you need anything specific for me? 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Nope, that's about it. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Okay, sounds good. I'll keep you posted on the flight. I'm going to call them just to. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Make sure and then. All right, thanks. 

**Maria Calcetero:**
Okay, bye. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
See you.
