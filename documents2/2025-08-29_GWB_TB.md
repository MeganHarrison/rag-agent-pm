## Transcript

**Nick Jepson:**
How's it going, Jack? 

**Jack Curtin:**
Hey, Nick. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Hey. 

**Nick Jepson:**
Everything going all right? 

**Jack Curtin:**
Oh, yeah, just busy. Busy. Let's go over. We'll start with the conversation as far as getting everything out of the building. Glenmark on Tuesday is getting out their two by sixes, all their studs first thing Tuesday morning. Anything? The only thing that will be left on the site will be a scissor. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Lift. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Their gang box and then a stack of dens glass so that we can hang it at the ceiling at the dock door. But they're going to keep that outside next to the ADA ramp in a safe location. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Okay. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Next, CSC fire alarm is working on condensing down there for things. They're going to be ready for their. Their walkthrough on our walkthrough on Tuesday at 1 o'. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Clock. 

**Jack Curtin:**
I've told them to start taking their things out of the building today. They said okay. The painters are also going to condense down their paint buckets, so that covers framers. Painters, electricians are going to be having a pickup first thing Tuesday morning as well. It looks like the only thing that's going to be in the building is Goodwill's trash boxes and stuff for build out and stuff like that. Direct questions you got for me. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Good. On the striping. We're gonna be what it looks like. 8:00 clock on Tuesday. 

**Nick Jepson:**
Yeah, that's what he told me. 

**Jack Curtin:**
That's what Zach said. 

**Nick Jepson:**
Yeah. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Okay. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
And Nick, I'm just looking at your change order now. Looks fine. 

**Nick Jepson:**
It's fine to send out. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Yeah. Do they have to pick a color? 

**Nick Jepson:**
Those are the color options. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Okay. All right. I'm just looking through the last of the pages and we have. Is there, is there mounting? We need to open up that drywall for mounting. And that's captured and being repaired? Yes. Okay. And the gutters are. 

**Nick Jepson:**
The gutters. So there's, there's that gutter system, then there's scuppers on the side, and I guess it pours out the side. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
And that's a complete system, looks like. Yeah. Okay. 

**Nick Jepson:**
It does. It doesn't include like gutters going to the ground, but the way it's designed it, it goes out the side. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
So do we need downspouts, the ones that return back to the building and down, or are these good just to leave as is? 

**Nick Jepson:**
I'm going to pull up, pull up the detail. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Okay. We definitely want to make sure we're covered for mounting and water. 

**Nick Jepson:**
This is, this is how it. It drains out the sides. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Yeah. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Okay. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
So it's a spillway yeah, yeah, that should be fine because it's to overhang the sidewalk and be the park. 

**Nick Jepson:**
They said they just the top to. To the building. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Yeah, I don't think there's any. They wouldn't have anything to tuck flashing under. Yeah, yeah, this is fine. Okay. How are you doing on your updated list, Jack? 

**Jack Curtin:**
Good. I'm about to bring it up here right now. I don't have it broken down in certain areas quite yet. I've been running around. Yeah, I don't have that in order. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Okay. Yeah, just let's catch up on it when you got it in order. But did you talk to the fire suppression guy. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Chris Lopez? No, I haven't got a hold of him yet. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Have you called him? 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yes. No answer. Let me. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Put his number in the chat. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Okay. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
And then I'll give him a call. Has Dylan showed up yet? 

**Jack Curtin:**
No, but Zach told me that now it looks like he's only going to mobilize his equipment today, but he'll actually start on Tuesday. But he said even starting on Tuesday is. He'll still have enough time to be done. Done on Friday. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Okay. Yeah. 

**Nick Jepson:**
And he did. When we were going over. 

**Jack Curtin:**
I'm sorry. Somebody just started beating us. Sorry. Can you start? Hold on. It's so loud in here. Let me walk outside. Okay. Sorry, Nick, go ahead. 

**Nick Jepson:**
He did say when we were initially creating a plan that today he. He was just going to mobilize. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Yeah, today. He was going to mobilize today. I'd probably start next week. I just wanted to make sure he was on site, on time for mobilizing. And if he showed up today and not because you're looking towards the middle of the afternoon out there now. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
And. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Then, do you have. Josh is there for the full day and that. Do you have him coming back Tuesday morning? 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yes. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Okay. Yep. 

**Jack Curtin:**
I reached out to their office to schedule him again for Tuesday. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Yeah, we definitely want to keep him there and moving and keep that place clean. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Oh, yeah, I agree. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
And make sure you're holding people accountable for stuff they should be cleaning up. Don't just rely on Josh for everything. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Oh, no, Totally out front. Yeah. I've had conversations with drywallers, painters in their lay down area that you know, of course, when you take your paint buckets out of here and you condense, also get a good cleanup over here. Don't just take your paint buckets and leave it how it looks. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Yeah. And that rebar on the side of the shoulder of that restaurant. Make sure the masons get that out of there. 

**Jack Curtin:**
True. Yeah. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
So TCO timeline. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yeah. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
What's. Are we on schedule for everything that's supposed to be going on out there today? That's going on. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yeah. Can it. So we'll. Let's start at the canopy. Canopy is wrapped in dens glass, so it's just missing EFIs. That shouldn't hold up any kind of TCO. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Are the columns done yet? 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yes, he. Well, he's on his fourth one. Three. Three out of the four done. The donation entry door, they came out. They cut it in. Cut in the lock. It's operational. So then we're walking into the receiving area. That's good. It's good to go. Nothing over there should keep us from getting our TCO over there. As far as construction material, I was mentioning to Nick. I think you jumped in here by then too. We got a plan for all that to leave that area come first thing Tuesday morning. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Okay. Do you need the soap dispensers and the accessories installed in the bathrooms for TB? I'm assuming you probably do. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Say that again. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
All the. Like the soap dispensers in the bathroom. Yeah. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Are you saying. Are they installed? 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Yeah, because they were. There was. They were in the boxes on the floors yesterday. Just double check and make sure. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yeah, let me double check. Doctor Area. Of course. We should be hearing back from Chris with Siemens about the fire sprinkler head. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
What's going on with the fire alarms and deem. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Fire alarms are good. Dean's got a couple more emergency lights to hang up at the exit doors that they're doing right now. And then CSC has confirmed with me again today that they're going to be ready for testing or they're going to be ready for our walk on Tuesday at 1 o'. Clock. Their project manager guaranteed it. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Okay. 

**Nick Jepson:**
Has Goodwill put up any signs on the rooms? 

**Jack Curtin:**
Signage in the rooms? 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Is that what you said? 

**Nick Jepson:**
The bathrooms need to be labeled? 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Yeah, they did get. 

**Jack Curtin:**
They did get the bathroom signage up. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Yeah, they got wall signs and door signs. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Okay. Yeah. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
On the bathrooms. So what's going to be left after today for Tuesday for TCO? Just striping. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Just striping. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
And we have that schedule. 8 o'. Clock. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yeah, sorry. Yeah, 8 o' clock in the morning. Just striping and everybody getting their shit out of the building. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Yeah, it's coordinating. That is going to be critical for you to be on top of everybody for. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yeah. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
And then make sure that delineation is up and looks good around that pit at the loading dock before Tuesday at inspection. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Oh, yes. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
The safety items are captured GWB. So do you have anything else, Jesse. 

**Nick Jepson:**
You were saying to put up like a construction area, do not enter signs. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
On that fence. 

**Nick Jepson:**
Jesse. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
R. So on the panels to delineate the work area. Yeah, like I was saying, I would go simple on that because do we have to have that in place for the inspection or is he going to give you direction? Okay, yeah, I would have it up. 

**Nick Jepson:**
They probably just have those at like Lowe's or Home Depot, Jack. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Yeah, that's. Yeah, there's the hardware store right down the street they probably have those at. I mean, if you got access to a printer, you could just print some and just put them, hang them on there in the little plastic insert things for paper. Yeah. Anything fancy? 

**Jack Curtin:**
No, yeah, I don't have any access to a printer. I have to run to the local Office Depot or Office Max here in town. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
No, just. Just go grab four or five signs. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Okay. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Just the cheap little plastic rectangles, zip tie them onto the panels. 

**Jack Curtin:**
GWB. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Yeah. Just so we can delineate that. And he doesn't hold us up on TB because we don't have that properly operating. 

**Jack Curtin:**
GWB. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
So is there anything else pending and you do have that captured? You and Josh gonna do that? Yes. Okay. Yeah. Still have the tape around the open hit though, Precaution tape like it is? Yes, just. Just make sure it's all up because they know they're going in and out of there. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Yeah, that has to be completely obvious and separated as far as the TB. Or they will. Yeah, that'll be a problem. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yeah. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
And when you, when you go to that hardware store, get count. I think there's five on the outside of the loading dock because McCrae took their rebar caps off those five pieces sticking up. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Okay. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
When they came back and took all their crap. So just give a few rebar craps and if Dylan shows up today, just ask him if he's got a few. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Okay. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Whichever happens first, just make sure those are on there because we don't want him seeing that stuff. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Amen. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Jesse, was there any other inspection related stuff that you can think of that we didn't cover? 

**Nick Jepson:**
Yeah, Jack did that hundred dollar fee. Did they respond to you about that? 

**Jack Curtin:**
They actually did recently. They said Joy Brown said, Good morning, Leanne. Please contact Jack Curtin to coordinate payment for a temporary occupancy inspection. The process application is attached for your reference. Yes. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
So, Nick, are you paying that or. 

**Nick Jepson:**
Jack, if you forward that to me, I'll fill it out and hopefully they accept credit cards. Sometimes cities don't accept that. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Okay. Yeah, I got. I got the paperwork filled out. She just. Leanne needs to be. Needs to. To get. To get in contact with me or. 

**Nick Jepson:**
You forward that to me and I'll try to start calling people to figure out how to. How we can pay that. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Okay, let's do that right now. I got it open. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Nick. Yeah. You might try a local bank because we. Jack might be able to go get a cashier's check with his credit card from a local bank. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
They should take it. They just charge you a service fee. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Oh, the city. They'll take it and just hit you with the fee. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Yeah, almost. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
We. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Everyone around here, we just pay with a card. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Hi. 

**Jack Curtin:**
I just sent that to you, Nick. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Yeah. See if you can find out how they'll let you pay it and do it. Do a good walkthrough. Jack. Of the whole place at the end of the day with pictures and get them into job planner so I can look at all the cleaning to help you direct Josh in the morning because he's only going to have four hours or five hours if he's coming at seven. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Okay. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
But I would talk to him and ask him to come for seven Tuesday. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Josh is our final cleaner. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
He's our temp labor. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Okay. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Final cleaning schedule for September 5th. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Okay. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Does he have like a mop or a dust mop to make those polished floors clean up pretty quick and easy? If you had a dust mop, you'll save and labor the cost of buying one. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
I didn't see a dust mop out there. I think they had big push brooms. Is that correct, Jack? 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yeah. All I got is push brooms. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Yeah. Grab a dust mop at the hardware store. GWB. Because they're starting to back out of there now, too, so broom finish is not going to cut it. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yeah. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Yeah. There's. There's only four or five photos. I think we. I sent you. I sent Jack a detail on how that EFIS and column needs to finish out. They got cut that dense glass up so the concrete seals directly to the column has a little positive slope away from it. And then what is the schedule now for the EFA sub? He's coming in tomorrow? 

**Jack Curtin:**
No, he is coming in either Tuesday or Wednesday to finish up the canopy. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
So how are we presenting this inspection then when they're looking at it? Because if they see the canopy needs work done on it. Are we trying to get. What are we telling them? It's just TCOs. They can set things up in the front and just leave it at that. Because we don't want to talk about them bringing trucks in the back and bringing trucks at the front. Donation canopy dropping off. Because then they'll. In case they want to say that now you can't. They can't use the canopy or something like that. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Yeah. 

**Jack Curtin:**
I mean, I don't. I wish I had the answer. What do y' all think we should. How we should word this to them? 

**Jesse Dawson:**
No, the answer is they just want to stock shelves and set up their store. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Okay. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Or. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
And then not even stock shows. I would say they just want to get things set up inside the store. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Yeah. They just want to bring product to the property. GWB. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
If I would even say that, I would just say they want to set up. Just leave it at that. You're like, I don't know what they're doing, but they want to get things set up, start to set things up in the store, because they're moving in in two weeks or whatever that is. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Okay. Do you guys think even. Even with it being by Tuesday with them getting a boom lift on that asphalt, even. Even by that time, should we still have plywood down to protect it? 

**Jesse Dawson:**
They're using lift instead of a scissor lift. 

**Jack Curtin:**
They've been. They've had a boom lift out here, and I imagine that they were going to try to use the boom lift again. Unless I go and tell them, no more boom lift. Let's. You have to finish this on a scissor lift. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
They should finish that on a scissor lift, being on that pavement. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Okay. So what I'll do is, is have him plan for the boom lift and then. Or for the scissor lift for him to take his boom lift off site. Because the scissor lift, he can use that same scissor lift over at the back dock door area. So he shouldn't even have to do that on a boom lift either. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Like, who's painting the front? The goodwill blue. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Inline is right now. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
So they're. They're done today with all that. 

**Jack Curtin:**
They're gonna. So what they've guaranteed me is the exterior of up front will be 100% done by tomorrow. And then come Monday, they will start on the exterior on the east side. But I can't have them on a boom lift over there either, or they'll tear up the asphalt. So they didn't. They need to do theirs on a scissor lift as well. But that scissor lift's not going to get that high. Not the one that they have on site. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
I mean, they would have to just use plywood and move it when they move the lift. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Okay. They're saying by end of day Monday that they'll have the whole exterior done. And then I have the signage company coming Thursday the 4th to install signage on the building. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Are they bringing their own lift? 

**Jack Curtin:**
The signage company? 

**Jesse Remillard:**
I'll. 

**Jack Curtin:**
I'll verify. I. I don't want to assume. And then they come out and ask, where's my L? 

**Jesse Remillard:**
And what. When is that fence rental company coming? 

**Jack Curtin:**
Tuesday the 2nd. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
And then did you get rid of that roof panel that Josh and I carried to the side of the building by the loading dock? 

**Jack Curtin:**
No, that's still there. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Okay, who does that belong to? And where does it need to go? 

**Jack Curtin:**
Just needs to be cut. I'll get it cut and thrown into the dumpster. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Okay? I can't think of anything else there. Jack, why don't you call me when you're doing your walk at the end of the day, okay? I don't necessarily want to do that. Method two. And, Nick, you and I should catch up this afternoon, too, because you're going to be off next week, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I want to catch up with you. So I'll shoot you over an invite, and then, Jack, I'll talk to you at the end of the day, and then if anything comes up in the meantime, let me know and I'll try Chris right now, and I'll put in the chat my success. 

**Nick Jepson:**
And, Jack, remember the weekly report? 

**Jack Curtin:**
10, 4. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Jesse, do you want to jump on a call after this one? Yep. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Yeah, I'll call you. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Okay. Okay, good. All right, thank you, guys.
