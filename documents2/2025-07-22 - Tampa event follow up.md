## Transcript
**Bclymer**: Maria, did we get any pricing on venues?
**Luke**: We have one second.
**Luke**: Let me accept it.
**Luke**: We have.
**Luke**: The zoo didn't reply to me.
**Luke**: I send them back.
**Luke**: Nothing yet from them.
**Luke**: And I have.
**Luke**: I think Samantha already uploaded some of the ones on the spreadsheet for the bow.
**Luke**: The armor one, and I think she had another one here.
**Luke**: I see only the armature works, and I think she was already pricing on the bolt.
**Luke**: I think she just hadn't added yet.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Now I can see everybody.
**Eileeniglesias2**: What's happening, everybody?
**Bclymer**: What's up, man?
**Eileeniglesias2**: What's up, Luke.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Good to meet you, my man.
**Bclymer**: You too, man.
**Eileeniglesias2**: If I'm.
**Eileeniglesias2**: If I'm a little bit disheveled, guys, I'm currently entering my 16th hour without power, so I'm feeling that.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Feeling the effects.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah, no water, no power, no running water.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Like, it's crazy.
**Bclymer**: So again, Australia is the third world country.
**Eileeniglesias2**: No, I'm in Mexico, my brother.
**Eileeniglesias2**: It really is a third country.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah, strangers like that too, but yeah, no, perfect, guys.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Good to have everybody on.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Good to see everyone's smiling faces.
**Bclymer**: So, yeah, I'm looking at this spreadsheet here.
**Bclymer**: I mean, yeah, Amory, I guess that's supposed to be armory.
**Luke**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Three grand.
**Bclymer**: I don't know what the hell.
**Samanthaleigh840**: That's saxophonist.
**Samanthaleigh840**: See here?
**Samanthaleigh840**: Yeah.
**Samanthaleigh840**: So see?
**Samanthaleigh840**: Oh, no, that's a magician.
**Samanthaleigh840**: So, yeah, when I look here, I see three venues.
**Samanthaleigh840**: The Volt, Tampa Zoo, and Armature Works.
**Samanthaleigh840**: And I see one price.
**Eileeniglesias2**: No.
**Eileeniglesias2**: No electricity, guys.
**Luke**: Yeah, I thought I said some.
**Luke**: Samantha added the.
**Luke**: She said she was going to the occurring one for you and the.
**Luke**: The bull.
**Luke**: Because she already had the pricing for that one.
**Luke**: Didn't she send it to me?
**Luke**: No, I think she sent it to everybody, but she didn't.
**Luke**: She forgot to add it, I'm sure.
**Bclymer**: All right, well.
**Samanthaleigh840**: So far, not off to a great start.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I mean, it's.
**Bclymer**: It's difficult for Luke and I to make a decision when there is no choice.
**Eileeniglesias2**: The limited choice.
**Eileeniglesias2**: How many places in Tampa do you think could host an event that you.
**Eileeniglesias2**: You feel comfortable with?
**Bclymer**: Well, I mean, right here we've got 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 listed on the spreadsheet.
**Samanthaleigh840**: One has a number by it.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Okay.
**Eileeniglesias2**: In terms of.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Terms of the actual number of a thing.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah, the cost of the hiring, the thing.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I think the other ones do.
**Eileeniglesias2**: It's just inside those menu things, inside of the links which.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Which can be looked at and then given a price.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I mean, yeah, a lot of time.
**Eileeniglesias2**: A lot of those times, it was like they.
**Eileeniglesias2**: They could hide bouncers.
**Eileeniglesias2**: They could provide bartenders so that the number could be, could actually take the whole of the number down.
**Eileeniglesias2**: And I think that's what the problem was.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So we can definitely get a number for the venues and just start there and then work our way back.
**Bclymer**: I mean, yeah, I mean, so I guess, yeah, if I went in here, I clicked on every single link and I went and I built a spreadsheet and said, here's the base price, here's the add ons, then yes, I would be able to compare apples to apples.
**Samanthaleigh840**: But right now, obviously there's only one.
**Bclymer**: I can't do it because if the.
**Bclymer**: When I look at the vault, what I'm seeing is it's $12,000 to rent, you know, which is stupid.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I don't think it's that special on the corporate package.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Or is that the wedding package?
**Bclymer**: I mean, I guess the corporate package.
**Bclymer**: Like, I don't know.
**Bclymer**: That's the thing where if I just look at their website, you know, like, I don't know which one is it?
**Bclymer**: Like, how does it work?
**Bclymer**: Like, you know, those are the things that I have to pick up the phone and do a little research.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So, yeah, I mean, you know, absolutely.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Well, that's, that's just, that's just four calls that we can make and, and those four calls can give us a price because I think it's a lot of time, it's just like, oh, what packages?
**Eileeniglesias2**: You want this and that.
**Eileeniglesias2**: But if we press them hardcore, we'd be able to get price on them for sure.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I can tell you off that.
**Bclymer**: You know, Luke and I spoke last night.
**Bclymer**: I can tell you.
**Bclymer**: I think Armature Works is a bad choice because it's already a place that people go and if we have something.
**Samanthaleigh840**: There, like, I mean it's, it's going.
**Bclymer**: To be a mess.
**Bclymer**: Like people will come and go as they please, which isn't exactly, you know, what you want.
**Bclymer**: You know, I thought, I thought the aquarium was a cool idea, you know, because they've got a rooftop and all.
**Samanthaleigh840**: That.
**Sammatheson5**: You know, I'm still waiting on them to like answer me.
**Sammatheson5**: I've left two voicemails and like one of those follow up submissions and they just send you straight to voicemail.
**Sammatheson5**: So I wanted to like make sure that you knew that too because I would love like the craziest.
**Sammatheson5**: They said that you can like swim with animals.
**Sammatheson5**: You can have different animals, like at your event, like live and in the mix.
**Sammatheson5**: So like it would, it would be a really great spot.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Could you imagine fucking penguins on the dance floor.
**Bclymer**: I mean, seriously, doing a slow dance.
**Eileeniglesias2**: With a pink penguin?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I mean, that would be sick.
**Eileeniglesias2**: We'll get a penguin suit with the penguin.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Now you're talking.
**Bclymer**: That would be epic.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Absolutely.
**Eileeniglesias2**: But I guess the only thing is, like, we could do it like the real estate, like, you know, Brandon, literally hound them until they pick up.
**Eileeniglesias2**: We can do that for that.
**Eileeniglesias2**: If that's kind of where you're leaning, which.
**Eileeniglesias2**: It sounds like you're leaning more towards that because of how crazy.
**Bclymer**: I mean, maybe.
**Bclymer**: I mean, again, I don't know.
**Bclymer**: I mean, for all I know, it's $35,000.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Right?
**Bclymer**: Like, that's, you know, I guess the thing is, like, when I was looking at some of these places, like, you know, the vault, you know, I'm.
**Bclymer**: Is there an outdoor area?
**Bclymer**: It kind of looks like it's all indoor.
**Bclymer**: From what I'm seeing on here, again, it seems pretty pricey.
**Bclymer**: I mean, you know, the.
**Bclymer**: I.
**Bclymer**: The idea was.
**Bclymer**: Or is.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Should I.
**Bclymer**: Like, ideally we.
**Bclymer**: We have an outside space, like, you know, where there's some cool going on.
**Bclymer**: Like you can do somebody twirling fire stuff, you know, or, you know, like.
**Bclymer**: Like, obviously, like the.
**Bclymer**: I. I think the ice sculptor thing's cool.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Saxophonist.
**Bclymer**: Those are all cool.
**Bclymer**: I don't know what a speed sketch art is.
**Bclymer**: Probably not, but, yeah, I mean, just like, just something that people want to pull out their phones and take a video of.
**Samanthaleigh840**: That's key.
**Bclymer**: Right?
**Bclymer**: You know, so anything with fire, penguins, all that kind of stuff, I feel like.
**Bclymer**: But yeah, I mean, you know, that's the biggest thing is like, can we, you know, figure out what spaces?
**Bclymer**: Like, you know, I don't.
**Bclymer**: Do we ever hear backs from the zoo?
**Bclymer**: What'd they say?
**Bclymer**: I don't know where the Tampa Zoo is.
**Bclymer**: Anybody?
**Sammatheson5**: I didn't.
**Sammatheson5**: No.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Who did?
**Bclymer**: Did anybody.
**Bclymer**: Has anybody called him.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Zoom in particular?
**Eileeniglesias2**: No, not.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Not necessarily.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I don't know where.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Where that is.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Would it.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Would it be in there?
**Eileeniglesias2**: In downtown?
**Bclymer**: It's kind of a shitty spot.
**Bclymer**: It's.
**Bclymer**: It's like miles away, north of Seminole Heights.
**Eileeniglesias2**: But I think.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I think a lot of.
**Eileeniglesias2**: A lot of the places were cut out because of how far away it was as well.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah, I don't think that would be.
**Bclymer**: It's too far.
**Samanthaleigh840**: So.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And then the red door number five is.
**Bclymer**: I've never.
**Bclymer**: This is just a firehouse, right?
**Sammatheson5**: Yeah.
**Sammatheson5**: So it's like an old firehouse turned event space.
**Sammatheson5**: But if I'm not mistaken, they do have the outdoors.
**Sammatheson5**: They have, like, their Own, like separate, like I guess not garden, but outdoor.
**Sammatheson5**: Huge patio with seating and stuff.
**Sammatheson5**: Okay.
**Sammatheson5**: So I also thought about Motor Enclave.
**Sammatheson5**: If you see Enclave, I don't know how to say that.
**Sammatheson5**: I think it's on Club.
**Sammatheson5**: There's just been a lot of people who have been there.
**Sammatheson5**: But it is a great.
**Sammatheson5**: I mean it's a huge space, like indoors and outdoors.
**Sammatheson5**: Crazy ass cars can be there.
**Sammatheson5**: Great for pictures obviously and can feet.
**Sammatheson5**: It can fit 1200 people.
**Sammatheson5**: So it's a lot of space that's kind of also another downfall.
**Sammatheson5**: But it's a really cool area.
**Sammatheson5**: I don't know if you guys have been.
**Bclymer**: It's called Motor Enclave Tampa.
**Sammatheson5**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Where's it at?
**Bclymer**: Is it in downtown Tampa?
**Sammatheson5**: It is.
**Sammatheson5**: Double check.
**Bclymer**: I've heard of it.
**Bclymer**: It does sound really cool as well.
**Bclymer**: I haven't been to it though.
**Bclymer**: It is 20 minutes, 25 minutes.
**Bclymer**: I mean it's past, it's past the casino.
**Samanthaleigh840**: It's.
**Bclymer**: It's up off 75.
**Samanthaleigh840**: I mean it's.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah.
**Sammatheson5**: You know, is that worse than if we were to choose St. Pete?
**Bclymer**: I mean, not in my opinion, but I mean, you guys, I mean, what do you guys think?
**Eileeniglesias2**: One was cut off because it was too far, wasn't it?
**Eileeniglesias2**: Or no one.
**Eileeniglesias2**: No one.
**Bclymer**: So motor enclave is 25 minutes northeast of Tampa.
**Bclymer**: Downtown.
**Bclymer**: It's literally in the middle of nowhere.
**Bclymer**: It's in Marina Springs park, you know, so if our concern was Ubers, if you went 25 minutes the other direction, you're going to be like kind of downtown St. Pete.
**Bclymer**: I would think people would be more apt to go there than, you know, in the middle of nowhere.
**Bclymer**: But I, I don't know.
**Bclymer**: I mean, yeah, I would agree on that.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I mean, Motorola would be tight if you're, you know, driving something.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I see this red door.
**Bclymer**: They do have an outdoor space.
**Bclymer**: It's up near Seminole Heights.
**Bclymer**: Do we know how much that cost, by chance?
**Sammatheson5**: No, I was on the phone with him and his name is Dominique.
**Sammatheson5**: I was on the phone with him and he told me he would send me a price book.
**Sammatheson5**: I checked back in this morning as well.
**Sammatheson5**: Haven't heard anything but scheduled a time to check it out.
**Sammatheson5**: Anyway, his only availability was Friday.
**Sammatheson5**: So the chance to even at least meet in person.
**Bclymer**: Let's build a fucking event space.
**Bclymer**: These guys obviously make so much money.
**Samanthaleigh840**: They don't give a shit about fucking communication.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Jesus.
**Sammatheson5**: No, really.
**Bclymer**: So, yeah, so I'd say Armature Works is, is, you know, out.
**Bclymer**: Tampa Zoo's out.
**Bclymer**: You know, the vault isn't terrible.
**Bclymer**: I just, you know, I'm not sure what the pricing is.
**Bclymer**: It looks like all their stuff is like pretty much you got to do everything through them.
**Sammatheson5**: Yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: Very, very little flexibility.
**Bclymer**: Regular number five doesn't seem terrible and who knows how flexible and stuff they are.
**Bclymer**: Is there any.
**Bclymer**: Anything else like, you know, the.
**Bclymer**: That we can think of?
**Bclymer**: I mean, can you like.
**Eileeniglesias2**: There's definitely any, any connections in there to like mansions or mansions, you know, that could throw a party?
**Eileeniglesias2**: Maybe not Airbnb.
**Sammatheson5**: So I've definitely looked at a lot, but so many of them are just in residential areas that we're looking to have like loud music or a lot of people coming in and out.
**Sammatheson5**: Like a lot of them have perfuse by 10pm like a lot of those rentals.
**Sammatheson5**: So that kind of dampens.
**Bclymer**: And you know, to have a true mansion party, like the size you're talking about, like, good.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, you're gonna be again, pushed out a little bit.
**Samanthaleigh840**: You're going to be in.
**Samanthaleigh840**: In, you know, St. Pete on, you.
**Bclymer**: Know, the water or you're going to.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Be in, you know, 30 minutes north of Tampa.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Gotcha.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Makes sense.
**Eileeniglesias2**: It just, it just seems like.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah, so the venue is just the, the first hurdle, but what we could do is maybe collectively all of us just push forward trying to get something that's.
**Eileeniglesias2**: That might be more.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Is.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Is there any event spaces that you know of that are.
**Eileeniglesias2**: We haven't even tapped into yet or is it just that's.
**Eileeniglesias2**: That's packed out, like that's all of them in.
**Eileeniglesias2**: In Tampa.
**Bclymer**: I mean, there's definitely more.
**Bclymer**: You know, there's definitely more.
**Bclymer**: There's no way we've captain every.
**Bclymer**: I mean, you know, the other, the other option is.
**Bclymer**: Is looking at like an industrial space of some sort or a, you know, something along those lines.
**Bclymer**: You know, that's going to put a little, A little bit more to it.
**Sammatheson5**: But it would be cool if.
**Sammatheson5**: Because they have.
**Sammatheson5**: I mean, I don't know if you guys went.
**Sammatheson5**: They had the shelter one.
**Sammatheson5**: So like they had it out of a freaking hangar, like something like that.
**Sammatheson5**: It's that indoor outdoor.
**Sammatheson5**: I mean, if you're outdoor enough, like the fire is okay, but it's like shit like that.
**Sammatheson5**: I don't know how to top that.
**Sammatheson5**: Like, I'm not, I'm thinking like if you were like a marina or something.
**Sammatheson5**: Very.
**Sammatheson5**: But then you're only.
**Sammatheson5**: You only have like planks in water.
**Bclymer**: What is it called?
**Sammatheson5**: Shell to air.
**Bclymer**: Oh, shell tear.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Isn't that.
**Bclymer**: That's the.
**Bclymer**: That's by the end.
**Luke**: Yeah.
**Luke**: You already have a place there?
**Luke**: No, for the.
**Luke**: No, it wasn't the.
**Luke**: Or even.
**Luke**: What's the other event?
**Luke**: Right.
**Sammatheson5**: It was the te.
**Sammatheson5**: Event like you sponsored, right?
**Sammatheson5**: Yeah, yeah.
**Sammatheson5**: They just have the hotel or a one there too.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I mean, I think that things.
**Bclymer**: I mean, two events inside of what, three months?
**Sammatheson5**: It's overkill.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I would say this.
**Bclymer**: Looking at this, this Nova 535 place, this looks pretty.
**Bclymer**: Pretty cool.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Is this the.
**Eileeniglesias2**: The fire hydrant place?
**Eileeniglesias2**: Is it Nova.
**Bclymer**: Nova 535 is.
**Samanthaleigh840**: See, it's.
**Bclymer**: In, say, Pete.
**Bclymer**: It's in st.
**Bclymer**: It's downtown St. Pete, essentially.
**Sammatheson5**: Yeah.
**Sammatheson5**: It's cute.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I mean, so there's this place called CL Space.
**Bclymer**: It looks like an eor.
**Bclymer**: I think the problem with that is you can have the hood.
**Bclymer**: Let's see here.
**Bclymer**: The Rialto Theater.
**Samanthaleigh840**: That's downtown.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Let's see.
**Eileeniglesias2**: The other thing that you can look at is like shuttling people to the spot as well.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So like in Hollywood, the hills, they.
**Eileeniglesias2**: They.
**Eileeniglesias2**: No one can get up there.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So they definitely look at, you know, shuttles just coming and going.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: Not a bad idea.
**Bclymer**: I mean, you know, then you're.
**Bclymer**: You're.
**Bclymer**: What?
**Bclymer**: You're having everybody drive to a certain spot and then a bus.
**Bclymer**: Like, you know, how does that work?
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah.
**Eileeniglesias2**: In terms of like.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah, I guess it's something you could do.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Like, you know, people could drive there or it makes it easier.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Maybe a downtown pickup, if that makes sense.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Yeah.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Then you.
**Bclymer**: But then you're, you know, again, you've got the parking stuff and I, you.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Know, I becomes a mess.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: The new Cigar City.
**Bclymer**: A unique cider need, industrial vehicle in.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Space, crap bar opening private events.
**Bclymer**: That kind of looks cool.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Cigar City, cider and mead.
**Bclymer**: Have you ever heard of that?
**Bclymer**: Same.
**Sammatheson5**: I have actually.
**Sammatheson5**: Cigar City Brewing is really great.
**Sammatheson5**: Do they have a location?
**Sammatheson5**: Does it say their locations?
**Sammatheson5**: Like, if you're on their website, I think they have one in St. Pete as well with like a huge outdoor space.
**Sammatheson5**: They have.
**Sammatheson5**: They have like food trucks out there.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Maybe.
**Samanthaleigh840**: I mean, this place is Tampa.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Yeah, this place is.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Yeah, this place is like Ybor Cigar City, Siren, Maine.
**Sammatheson5**: And it's outdoors as well.
**Bclymer**: I'm trying to get this damn thing to load.
**Samanthaleigh840**: To see.
**Luke**: No, it doesn't seem like it.
**Luke**: I'm looking at it, but it seems like it's indoor.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I mean, unless they have a rooftop.
**Samanthaleigh840**: I don't know why it's not.
**Luke**: You can see it.
**Sammatheson5**: There are quite a few rooftops in Ybor.
**Sammatheson5**: As well.
**Sammatheson5**: But you are right about, you know, especially on a Saturday.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Exactly.
**Sammatheson5**: It'd be nice if it were like, like 4 to 8pm because you could do like a sunset type deal.
**Sammatheson5**: But yeah, that's in the middle of the weekend, right?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Again, we run to the same thing that we run to an armchair.
**Bclymer**: Good.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So if we put it.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Put a question mark on.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Okay.
**Eileeniglesias2**: We all need to put our heads on to the venue.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Was there any other things that you were concerned about that you wanted to kind of to put in here to like, to us to work on specifically?
**Eileeniglesias2**: Were you happy with how the direction's going?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I mean, I would say.
**Bclymer**: I would say the biggest thing obviously, you know, is, is the venue because then that's going to guide a lot of stuff.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: You know, the biggest thing is, you know, I probably use like posh for the list.
**Bclymer**: You know, we need to come up with a. I would think we need to come up with an Instagram.
**Samanthaleigh840**: But what do you guys think?
**Eileeniglesias2**: I mean, not necessarily.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Especially if you've got a lot of people posting towards, you know, posting the flyer that we create.
**Eileeniglesias2**: But you definitely can.
**Eileeniglesias2**: The problem with that is that, you know, again, if you have a, have an Instagram that has like 30 people following or 10 people following, people are going to get a bit weirded out by that.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Like, what is this?
**Eileeniglesias2**: Unless you're going to start an events company.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So I would say I would much rather put it towards the creative side and having a flyer that people could put on their Instagram and, and then put a link where they can link straight to the posh and.
**Eileeniglesias2**: And then we can go from there because I'm sure you'll.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I think, I think you may have an overabundance of people and you have to be a bit more selective because tamper.
**Eileeniglesias2**: It seems like you guys just event all of the time, 247 event every week, maybe.
**Bclymer**: I mean, I'd rather have.
**Bclymer**: I'd rather have that option.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so we don't need to do that.
**Bclymer**: So then we just need to come up with the flyer.
**Sammatheson5**: I did talk to like someone who would be interested.
**Sammatheson5**: I don't know if you recall, I might have brought him up.
**Sammatheson5**: Jerome, his name is Gouda on Instagram.
**Sammatheson5**: He did a lot of crowns shoots.
**Sammatheson5**: Talked to him and kind of gauged what he like is capable.
**Sammatheson5**: And come to find out he actually, he and Max run a production media house which is marketing.
**Sammatheson5**: So they would do all the graphic designing, they would do all the flyers, they would do any branding that you need.
**Sammatheson5**: They would do the pre event shots.
**Sammatheson5**: Like to hype up.
**Sammatheson5**: They would do at the event shots.
**Sammatheson5**: So that kind of helps kind of the gears because you can't.
**Sammatheson5**: I was looking at Posh.
**Sammatheson5**: You can't even start a link until you make a flyer.
**Sammatheson5**: Like you have to have a flyer on Posh to be recognized.
**Sammatheson5**: So yeah, starting with those empty pieces like, and we can throw together a quick fire to just get it on a link.
**Sammatheson5**: But I think you'd rather.
**Sammatheson5**: I would rather it just completed.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I mean, you know, it depends on timeline and cost.
**Samanthaleigh840**: I mean, I mean, you know, to.
**Bclymer**: Be honest, I think graphic design is a.
**Bclymer**: If that's your industry, get out of it.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Because chat GBT and is tearing it apart.
**Samanthaleigh840**: It is.
**Bclymer**: It's nuts how fast you can create stuff.
**Bclymer**: So yeah, so I, I would say, you know, the, you know, the flyer and marketing and, and then from there I guess it's just, you know, what is it just cold outreach, getting on Instagram and messaging a zillion people.
**Bclymer**: Is that the, the name of the game?
**Sammatheson5**: I think like Sam, me and Eileen would probably have a really good chance at that.
**Sammatheson5**: If we have some pre event marketing, like if it's already posted on our pages and our stories and we do have a pretty good presence, I would say online that cold outreach won't be as weird from us.
**Sammatheson5**: And then continuously cross posting.
**Sammatheson5**: So once we do have some content or anything to market, I'll tap, I'll.
**Sammatheson5**: I'll reshare anything that you post in your stories and vice versa.
**Sammatheson5**: So because we all have different followers and we all have different people that could or couldn't be in our circle.
**Bclymer**: What about, you know, Sam, what about, like, what do you call those people that?
**Bclymer**: Like, you pay them 500 bucks and they'll post something.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Yeah, yeah, those people, whatever.
**Bclymer**: Like, you know, they got 200000 followers or whatever.
**Bclymer**: They're famous in, you know, their local market or whatever.
**Samanthaleigh840**: And like, you know, you.
**Bclymer**: Is that how that works?
**Bclymer**: You, you know, throw them bone and they say, yeah, I can't wait to go Saturday night to the radish has been around.
**Sammatheson5**: Yeah.
**Sammatheson5**: In my experience, you kind of give them this reverse psychology like, hey, we're comping your ticket or something like just to make them feel more like they're doing a service for you per se, like to be there and to.
**Samanthaleigh840**: It's a good idea.
**Eileeniglesias2**: It can definitely do that.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Final thing, you can definitely pay a lot of the Tampa guys specifically.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Tampa girls specifically, for sure.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Probably not the guys I just stick with the girls.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So any sort of high profile Tampa people for sure.
**Eileeniglesias2**: The other strategy is putting a little kind of Facebook ad up as well.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Can be useful to just get people in the door just as kind of like filling out a submission form and then we can reach out to them if there's any prospects there.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So there's three different avenues and then you've got the modeling agencies, which is the last one, which is the big one as well.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So if you could reach out to them and anyone that they can bring as well.
**Bclymer**: Is that.
**Bclymer**: So when you say like, I mean, did you do an Instagram ad or specifically a Facebook ad?
**Eileeniglesias2**: No, no, Instagram ad only.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah, not Facebook.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So Instagram, it can be, can be on a different.
**Eileeniglesias2**: It could be on any of us Elval pages just setting up a, just changing it to a business account from there going to business manager, starting up a pixel and then from there putting it out out there, giving it a bit of a, bit of a boost for maybe the week before and see if it brings any, any good leads in from there.
**Eileeniglesias2**: And you can always tailor it per day to the leads.
**Eileeniglesias2**: That's another strategy you can do the, the, the putting the flyer out will definitely get some interest.
**Eileeniglesias2**: And then from there in the DMs.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So there's probably like five strategies you could do very effectively.
**Eileeniglesias2**: And then from there it's the content marketing, getting the right people that you could again, Brandon, like you know, either say, hey, we'll comp your ticket or here's some money.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Can you post this as well?
**Eileeniglesias2**: Those are two different options.
**Sammatheson5**: Can you post this?
**Sammatheson5**: Like I've been approached for like people will pay me to post on my story to market.
**Sammatheson5**: Like I don't even have to go do their event, but just to get it out there because they enjoy what I post or vice versa.
**Sammatheson5**: And next thing you know they have 20 new people posting with hundreds of viewers each.
**Bclymer**: We could do Amelia Arena.
**Sammatheson5**: A what?
**Bclymer**: We could run out the Arena.
**Bclymer**: Amelia Arena.
**Sammatheson5**: That's baller shit.
**Sammatheson5**: Like.
**Bclymer**: Luke, you're cool with another hundred, right?
**Bclymer**: Another hundred and one hundred thousand.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Oh man.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So is, is this company, you said it's called the, the production crew dot com.
**Bclymer**: Is that friends, you know?
**Sammatheson5**: Yeah, the production house.
**Sammatheson5**: Yeah, they have all their work on there and I tagged their Instagrams as well.
**Sammatheson5**: You can see the style that they do.
**Sammatheson5**: They're very much so videographers.
**Sammatheson5**: So if you want more visual marketing content, that way they know like really what the hell they're doing.
**Sammatheson5**: Those Are the same ones who were just in Spain and like, did the same thing as you guys.
**Bclymer**: I think I might be to.
**Bclymer**: I'm on this website called Here, I'll show you guys.
**Sammatheson5**: Brandon, your camera, like, feedback has been on a loop for like six minutes.
**Sammatheson5**: Like, it's just your mouth going like.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Oh, well, let me change it.
**Sammatheson5**: Oh, okay.
**Sammatheson5**: Yeah.
**Sammatheson5**: That does not look like their website.
**Sammatheson5**: One second.
**Luke**: You know that's a production crew.
**Luke**: I think yours is a production house, correct?
**Sammatheson5**: Yes.
**Sammatheson5**: Let me get their website up for you.
**Sammatheson5**: But again, I do feel like it's important, like if we have both, at least someone with cameras and a venue, the rest just melts together because we can do content inside the venue, like ahead of time, outside of the venue.
**Sammatheson5**: On the way to.
**Samanthaleigh840**: I was.
**Bclymer**: Look, I was just looking through this website's portfolio, you know, like, some good ideas here.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Like, you know, they got the West Shore Yacht Club.
**Samanthaleigh840**: You know, some of these places that they've got are pretty cool.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Yeah.
**Samanthaleigh840**: I don't know what these.
**Samanthaleigh840**: These guys do, but I guess they just set everything up, it looks like.
**Samanthaleigh840**: But yeah, I mean, this is a.
**Samanthaleigh840**: This might be a.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Thought.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Not sure what the details are.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so, yeah, I mean, I guess that's the biggest thing is like to hammer on place, right?
**Samanthaleigh840**: Obviously the biggest thing.
**Bclymer**: So does everybody have access.
**Bclymer**: Say it again, Maria.
**Bclymer**: Does everybody have access to that spreadsheet thing you sent me?
**Luke**: Yes, everybody has access to it.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Probably need to resend it to Luke.
**Bclymer**: Just a thought.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I mean, you know, I think.
**Bclymer**: I guess if we all just, you know, go through and, you know, populate that list and just tomorrow, you know, try to call as much as we can and just see who's available on that date and a price.
**Samanthaleigh840**: And then that way we can make a decision and really get the ball rolling.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Thousand percent.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Marie, do you think you could make a separate page, like, so I populated with things that are probably not necessary on that, but can you have a venues one and then a miscellaneous one and the miscellaneous one be all the extra stuff that we're looking at, but we have a specific venues one.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Because I think that that might have been a bit of confusing my bio.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I've started to populate it with all the other stuff that probably just confused a hell of a lot of people.
**Bclymer**: You're muted, Maria.
**Luke**: No, but the question was for you, but I can reply on your behalf.
**Luke**: Yes.
**Samanthaleigh840**: What was the question?
**Luke**: That's a good idea.
**Luke**: Yeah.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Oh, I don't know.
**Eileeniglesias2**: But yeah, that could be good.
**Eileeniglesias2**: And then from there Just like hound, hound, hound.
**Eileeniglesias2**: And then, and then we'll be able to get something.
**Eileeniglesias2**: It's kind of like real estate brand, like you know, just hound the out of them, which we'll do for you guys and then get something and then get things.
**Eileeniglesias2**: If we could.
**Eileeniglesias2**: If we could.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah.
**Eileeniglesias2**: It's probably more the merrier and see what, you know, choose the best one from there sounds like.
**Eileeniglesias2**: See what the best packages are.
**Eileeniglesias2**: And then a lot of these people, hopefully we try to get something that is not just.
**Eileeniglesias2**: You have to use our service and that's it.
**Eileeniglesias2**: That's where they hike up for us a lot.
**Sammatheson5**: Yeah, the goal is definitely like personalized as well and like down to like the security or the bartenders, the extra vendors.
**Sammatheson5**: We want to choice in food even.
**Sammatheson5**: Like we want food to reflect the vibe as well and not pre made stations and buffets and rolls, Hot Pockets.
**Sammatheson5**: Right.
**Sammatheson5**: But yeah, and I feel like once we again like I think that venue idea of everyone kind of just like sharks, like we're all just sharking out like the best one and then hound out, get a price now.
**Sammatheson5**: Do you, Brandon, do you want us to send it to like where once we get this information, just send it straight to the chat and wait for a response or.
**Bclymer**: Well, there's that spreadsheet that we have.
**Bclymer**: So that's what I was saying.
**Bclymer**: Like we can just populate it and put it in there because shit will.
**Sammatheson5**: Get built and then we'll just check in on it by the end of the day.
**Sammatheson5**: Like your different boats and areas.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Yeah, exactly.
**Samanthaleigh840**: And then we'll figure it out.
**Bclymer**: Pull trigger.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Cool.
**Bclymer**: Luke, you got anything?
**Bclymer**: No, sorry, I was, I was listening.
**Bclymer**: I was just looking.
**Bclymer**: Scouring downtown, St. Pete and some others.
**Bclymer**: So I'll be looking as well.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: In Tampa as well.
**Sammatheson5**: But I wish I knew.
**Sammatheson5**: Like I've been to so many different like I guess mansions in a way that they just have so much space from all my bartending.
**Sammatheson5**: Like when I do mobile bartending.
**Sammatheson5**: But there's that like client confidentiality.
**Sammatheson5**: Like I can't really hunt them back down and say, hey, I worked in your home.
**Sammatheson5**: Can I throw a party there?
**Sammatheson5**: Like I just wish I had like better interconnections that way.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Right.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Yeah, I mean, I mean it is what it is, right?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I mean I wouldn't let somebody throw.
**Samanthaleigh840**: A party in my house.
**Samanthaleigh840**: You know, if I have a mansion, I don't need the five grand to be honest.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Hang out.
**Bclymer**: Well, maybe armature is not that bad, man.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I mean I'll try to get this penguin man.
**Eileeniglesias2**: You know, it'd be a little bit of a trip to Antarctica, but I'm on more.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Yeah.
**Samanthaleigh840**: I'm telling you, that would be sick.
**Sammatheson5**: And honestly, that'd be even cooler, like, with that ice sculpture as well.
**Sammatheson5**: Like, of course, it'd be nice to have fire, but definitely ice sculpture.
**Sammatheson5**: And then you have, like, the penguin walking around it.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Or him making a penguin ice sculpture.
**Luke**: And we actually, once we have that, we have to design.
**Luke**: We have to choose a design for the ice sculpture.
**Luke**: Because they're asking me, what do we want as a design?
**Luke**: So they say logo, and I say, we don't want a logo.
**Luke**: So we need to decide about.
**Luke**: Once we have everything set up, those are extra.
**Luke**: But, you know, like.
**Luke**: Like, Zam said, once they do a majority of dolphins or fishes or whatever, but we can just pick one.
**Luke**: So just you guys let me know once you have an idea.
**Luke**: Luke and Brandon.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Sammatheson5**: If we do the aquarium, we'll do a dolphin.
**Bclymer**: And it's like, yeah, give me Brandon riding the dolphin.
**Luke**: Supposed to throw, like, alcohol, like tequila and all the stuff through that, you know?
**Sammatheson5**: Yeah, yeah, girl.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Have you guys, like.
**Eileeniglesias2**: The miscellaneous stuff is kind of like, I'll.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I'll populate that and see what else you like.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Because there's.
**Eileeniglesias2**: There's all sorts of things where, you know, I'm tapping in the Great Gatsby, I'm tapping into Wolf of Wall street, shit like that.
**Eileeniglesias2**: And there'll be something that we can come up with.
**Eileeniglesias2**: The speed caricature, we can drop that.
**Eileeniglesias2**: That was just an idea of, like, having a sketch artist there to do funny caricatures.
**Eileeniglesias2**: But if you like the ice sculpture, the saxophone, we might be able to do it maybe, you know, because he's asking a hell of a lot.
**Eileeniglesias2**: We might be able to switch that out from maybe a violinist maybe.
**Sammatheson5**: Yeah.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So different things like that.
**Eileeniglesias2**: And then I think just like, if you want live animals, you know, we could go eat them.
**Eileeniglesias2**: You know, we could dress up and some folk.
**Eileeniglesias2**: No, I'm kidding.
**Eileeniglesias2**: But, yeah, like, I'll throw some in there.
**Eileeniglesias2**: You just tell me what's.
**Eileeniglesias2**: What's too retarded, what's too out there, and what's, like, perfect.
**Eileeniglesias2**: And I'll just keep coming up with a couple of those.
**Sammatheson5**: I also started a mood board, so it has just ideas that I can throw into the miscellaneous.
**Sammatheson5**: Like, it'll be a link to the Canva mood board board.
**Sammatheson5**: It just.
**Sammatheson5**: It basically has, like, ideas of color schemes.
**Sammatheson5**: Like, it has ideas of the entertainment there.
**Sammatheson5**: Like, There's a woman wearing a champagne dress.
**Sammatheson5**: Like, little.
**Sammatheson5**: There's just.
**Sammatheson5**: It looks like a bulletin board.
**Sammatheson5**: So if you guys want to add anything to that or want to add any comments to it as well, and that'll continuously grow until the day before.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Awesome.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: I have no idea what a mood board is.
**Eileeniglesias2**: It's like a.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Like a.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Was it 20, 25 kind of vision board that figured out.
**Sammatheson5**: Yeah, it's like.
**Sammatheson5**: It's like if we're all in a meeting on I.
**Sammatheson5**: There's a big whiteboard right here, and we're just, like, slapping pictures of ideas.
**Sammatheson5**: Like, it's like a Pinterest just on the board and not on your phone.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Gotcha.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Yeah.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Pinterest.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Totally get it.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Absolutely.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So we get this done.
**Eileeniglesias2**: We get.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Do you.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Do you want it locked in by the end of the week?
**Eileeniglesias2**: You're happy with that timeline?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I mean, the sooner.
**Bclymer**: Sooner the better.
**Bclymer**: I think we're up against the clock here.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yep.
**Eileeniglesias2**: And then contingency plan with, you know, was it called Armitage or Armature?
**Bclymer**: I would say the contingency plan would be we bump it like, two weeks.
**Bclymer**: And, you know, instead of doing.
**Bclymer**: I'd rather.
**Bclymer**: I'd rather.
**Bclymer**: I'd rather bump it two weeks than get a shitty place.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Okay.
**Luke**: Okay.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Makes sense.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So, yeah.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Okay, cool.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Because that.
**Eileeniglesias2**: That'll help.
**Eileeniglesias2**: That'll help.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah, for sure.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Okay.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I understand, Maria.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Sorry.
**Luke**: No, no, it's okay.
**Luke**: You go.
**Luke**: So I was gonna say, not to put pressure, of course, but let's just have another meeting.
**Luke**: You said at the end of the week, Sam, so we can see how things are going.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, that's.
**Luke**: You, Sam.
**Luke**: I'm gonna call Sam and Sammy.
**Luke**: Samantha, I'm gonna call you Sammy.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Okay.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah, no, absolutely.
**Eileeniglesias2**: We can.
**Eileeniglesias2**: We can reconnect on that way.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Anthony.
**Eileeniglesias2**: That'll be good.
**Eileeniglesias2**: We'll come with more stuff, and then that'll be a bit more.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Shorter meeting in terms.
**Eileeniglesias2**: We got this done.
**Eileeniglesias2**: We've got this done.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Which one you want to pick, and then go from there.
**Eileeniglesias2**: And I'll.
**Eileeniglesias2**: And I'll have some.
**Sammatheson5**: Eileen's backing commission.
**Sammatheson5**: We'll have two more hands, two more eyes and other brain as well.
**Sammatheson5**: So that'll expedite the process.
**Luke**: Okay, cool.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Awesome.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Cool.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Brandon, you happy with that?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Thanks for playing.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Awesome.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Easy.
**Bclymer**: Done.
**Bclymer**: All right, guys, catch you later.
**Eileeniglesias2**: All right, cool.
**Eileeniglesias2**: See you soon.
**Luke**: Bye, guys.
**Luke**: Thank you.
**Sammatheson5**: Bye, guys.
**Sammatheson5**: Thank you.
