## Transcript
**Accounting**: Yeah, it's about five or six items.
**Accounting**: So I'm going to email it to you right now.
**Bclymer**: Did everything upload correctly for the credit card transactions?
**Fnjie**: Yeah, yeah, that works.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: Yeah, I will review that only in Joe Planner and Poker have been heated the code and related task.
**Fnjie**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right, so what are.
**Bclymer**: What other items?
**Bclymer**: How are we.
**Bclymer**: Give me an update.
**Accounting**: Go under audit.
**Accounting**: We uploaded the letters yesterday, so one.
**Accounting**: One person sent them back already.
**Accounting**: So Kevin verified everything before we sent it.
**Accounting**: It's good to go.
**Accounting**: They selected some more AP items, so I'm sending those to Fritzi right now to get copies and proof of payments.
**Accounting**: So I don't know what else they will select.
**Accounting**: So I guess waiting to hear back.
**Bclymer**: One thing we.
**Bclymer**: We keep getting these little things.
**Bclymer**: Like, you know, they emailed us asking for a line of credit documents and this 401k.
**Bclymer**: Can we not get a goddamn list?
**Bclymer**: Like, why do we have to piecemeal this?
**Accounting**: I.
**Accounting**: I thought we have.
**Accounting**: Is that something new that.
**Accounting**: That they just sent out?
**Accounting**: I don't think I saw that one.
**Bclymer**: Last night and tonight.
**Bclymer**: So today.
**Bclymer**: Last night.
**Bclymer**: Oh, you're not on this.
**Bclymer**: But yeah.
**Bclymer**: So Adrian asked for 401k.
**Bclymer**: Can you please send over the plan documentation for disclosure purposes?
**Bclymer**: And then last night I asked me for our line of credit documentation.
**Bclymer**: Like, you know, it just.
**Jdawson**: It.
**Bclymer**: You know, they just sent me a $46,000 bill.
**Bclymer**: I saw that, you know, on.
**Bclymer**: And you know, oh, not even done with everything.
**Bclymer**: But I'm like, why the are we wasting all this time piecemealing it when instead of like giving a list?
**Bclymer**: Like, did you not know we needed that before?
**Bclymer**: And you're just figuring this out the first time?
**Bclymer**: Like, this is ass backwards.
**Accounting**: Yeah, they.
**Accounting**: They just.
**Accounting**: And.
**Accounting**: But it sounds like they are towards the end of it because everything they asked for, they keep saying it's for.
**Accounting**: For like the footnotes, which I'm guessing maybe they didn't list that out previously, but hopefully we're at the tail.
**Accounting**: Tail end of this.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Accounting**: 401K document.
**Accounting**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: So that means you'll have to go back to the payroll company, huh?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I mean, it's just.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, no, no, it already said that the 401k document was already sent.
**Jdawson**: We already have everything.
**Jdawson**: The form and everything is under the.
**Jdawson**: The already sent it to them.
**Jdawson**: The what Is the return plan.
**Jdawson**: Everything okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I mean, if that's.
**Bclymer**: I wouldn't be surprised if they.
**Bclymer**: They're like, this isn't good enough, but whatever.
**Bclymer**: This isn't.
**Accounting**: Yeah, yeah.
**Accounting**: And.
**Accounting**: And in the, in the meetings too.
**Accounting**: A lot of the stuff we've said over and over again that we don't have it and to move forward without it, but it keeps coming back up.
**Accounting**: So hopefully today's meeting won't be like that.
**Jdawson**: See.
**Accounting**: So they replaced, they removed Spectre and replaced it with Forza and now they are asking for.
**Bclymer**: We already had Forza on the list.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I will do it right now when you send me Brandon.
**Jdawson**: So I'll send it to you now.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: This is an AP invoice for Forza.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Accounting**: I'll.
**Accounting**: I'll pull this and add it.
**Accounting**: This is for the AP invoices.
**Bclymer**: AP invoice to Forza on the Forza job.
**Bclymer**: Gotcha.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So what else?
**Bclymer**: How are we coming on the day to day accounting stuff?
**Bclymer**: So knowing now, Jose, that we can, we don't have to wait until we have everything coded for the credit cards.
**Bclymer**: Like you can, you can upload incrementally, correct?
**Fnjie**: Yeah, we can make a powershell upload.
**Fnjie**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: And then that hits the job.
**Fnjie**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: All right, well, so we need to make sure that we're, we're up.
**Bclymer**: Updating this and, and uploading it like every two weeks so that, that way timesheets are updated, you know, so we can, you know, we should be able to just be two weeks in the rear on the timesheets and then we can be as current as we can on the, on the credit card transaction.
**Bclymer**: So put a reminder in an SOP that hey, you know, whatever, every two weeks, you know, we are uploading this stuff so that our numbers are current on the jobs and we're not three months behind.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Fnjie**: And we will review that on the coded transaction and we will upload.
**Fnjie**: Yeah, every two weeks.
**Accounting**: I have a question on the credit cards.
**Accounting**: Brandon, you weren't on the meeting we had with job Planner, but Some of the PMs were questioning some of the charges that had hit their jobs from the credit cards.
**Accounting**: So do we need to have them review what's hitting their jobs before it gets imported or what do you, what do you think we should do?
**Bclymer**: Well, I mean, so the IT should map like what's coded to and approved should match what gets done.
**Bclymer**: I think what the.
**Bclymer**: Some of the questions that you're talking about is things that were not coded or whatever somehow are getting mis entered and not aligned.
**Bclymer**: Now us automatically uploading IT versus general entries should alleviate that risk.
**Bclymer**: So then it just comes down to if, if for instance, something gets miscoded or whatever.
**Bclymer**: But yeah, I mean if, unless they're, you know, complaining because, you know, I.
**Bclymer**: I hit their job with something or Jesse does or whatever, which in that case, you know, tough.
**Accounting**: Yeah, I think that's.
**Accounting**: That's what it was in some cases, either, you know, like Jesse's charge or somebody else's charge hitting their job and they don't know what it's for, and therefore, you know, we running around for, like, you know, 30 minutes trying to chase a 30 charge.
**Bclymer**: Well, here's the thing.
**Bclymer**: So, like, whenever those things get marked as approved, that means that it is.
**Bclymer**: Jesse or I have approved it to be coded.
**Bclymer**: So as long as it matches what we've done, that is correct.
**Bclymer**: And if you know somebody, you know, like, who is it that is complaining?
**Bclymer**: Aj?
**Accounting**: No, it was Glenn that was asking.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So, yeah, if Glenn is asking, he's just.
**Bclymer**: You can be like, hey, this is what was approved by your supervisor.
**Bclymer**: If you, you know.
**Bclymer**: You know, this is what it says.
**Bclymer**: Like, so if.
**Bclymer**: If you don't think it's accurate, get.
**Bclymer**: Get with your supervisor one at a time.
**Justin**: Yes.
**Justin**: Yes.
**Justin**: Brandon has already coded it for the time sheet.
**Justin**: I'll be asking for approval.
**Justin**: Currently, we're still using the spreadsheet.
**Bclymer**: No, we should be using Notion now, Maria.
**Bclymer**: That's set up, correct.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: You're muted, Maria.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, sorry.
**Jdawson**: Yes, it.
**Jdawson**: Is.
**Jdawson**: It up.
**Jdawson**: So I think we.
**Jdawson**: We were supposed to test it out, but.
**Jdawson**: Fritzi, did we test it out in.
**Jdawson**: On.
**Jdawson**: In the timesheets that we have?
**Jdawson**: I think Megan asked because everything was set up already for the timesheets.
**Bclymer**: So let's.
**Bclymer**: You know, let's do that, and you can test it in this.
**Bclymer**: In the test scenario, in Acumatica or something.
**Bclymer**: Or whatever.
**Bclymer**: But, yeah, I don't like we should be using Notion for timesheets.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So, Fritzi, I remember we wanted to test it.
**Jdawson**: Let me know if we want to go.
**Jdawson**: We can put whatever numbers.
**Jdawson**: It's.
**Jdawson**: It's okay.
**Jdawson**: We don't have to put, like, the right numbers right now.
**Jdawson**: It can be zero, zero or something just to test it out and then just let me know if we need to do adjustments or anything.
**Jdawson**: Okay, but everything is set up.
**Accounting**: And those get approved in Notion by you, Brandon.
**Accounting**: They all come to you?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, they'll.
**Bclymer**: Me or Jesse.
**Accounting**: Yes.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Justin**: But for the time being, since you are not using that one, I will still go with a spreadsheet.
**Justin**: Right.
**Jdawson**: For payroll, you mean?
**Justin**: Yeah, Arrow.
**Jdawson**: So the thing is, when I don't want to give payroll the access to Notion because they don't have to seal all Our stuff, you know.
**Justin**: I know.
**Justin**: I.
**Justin**: I mean, the timesheet, since they have already filled out for the current.
**Jdawson**: Payroll, for the current parallel.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, you can send me.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, it's okay.
**Jdawson**: You send me the ones that we have right now.
**Jdawson**: So payroll is okay for this week, and then we'll just start to write.
**Jdawson**: If you want, after this.
**Jdawson**: Disconnect.
**Jdawson**: You and me, if you want.
**Jdawson**: Fatima, if you have some time, and let's test it out right away, and then we can start using it, like, after this.
**Jdawson**: But send me the timesheet right now.
**Jdawson**: I'll send it to payroll.
**Jdawson**: I'll make sure everything is fine for this payment.
**Jdawson**: And just so you know, also, I think Jack asked you for a 70 phone allowance that was already added.
**Jdawson**: And then also.
**Jdawson**: And just if.
**Jdawson**: If people ask, these allowances are going to be paid the first of the month.
**Jdawson**: You know, the first payment of the month.
**Jdawson**: Those.
**Jdawson**: Those are the ones that are being paid.
**Jdawson**: And then it will be collected at the.
**Jdawson**: At the.
**Jdawson**: At the beginning of the next month.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: I already explained it to Jack.
**Jdawson**: I explained it to Glenn, everybody.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: But just in case.
**Justin**: How.
**Justin**: How about for the reimbursement that they asked, that it has been passed.
**Justin**: Taxed.
**Jdawson**: They shouldn't be tasked.
**Bclymer**: Correct.
**Jdawson**: Jesse, I think you had a talk with Angela about why are they pto.
**Jdawson**: No, it's a pto, but their per diems are being taxed.
**Jdawson**: And we said they shouldn't be taxed.
**Justin**: She has not replied yet.
**Bclymer**: Correct.
**Bclymer**: It's an ex.
**Bclymer**: It's an expense.
**Bclymer**: It's a.
**Bclymer**: It's.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, it shouldn't be taxed.
**Jdawson**: So who is asking?
**Jdawson**: You should be tasked, Jack?
**Justin**: I think it's not.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Justin**: If it stops, there is a tax on the particular reimbursement, but if it's.
**Jmendez**: Paid to them after they've incurred the expense, it's not taxed.
**Jmendez**: If we paid them to go out of town, then it would be taxed, which we're not.
**Bclymer**: Everything's in the rears because they put it on their timesheet.
**Jmendez**: So they're getting reimbursed.
**Jmendez**: They're not getting paid.
**Accounting**: Is.
**Accounting**: Is Jack a new employee?
**Jdawson**: No, Jack.
**Jmendez**: Jack's been here for a minute.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, probably for Mike.
**Jdawson**: Is the new.
**Jmendez**: Is the new guy.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Jmendez**: John, Mike is in your.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: Anything else?
**Jdawson**: Not on my end.
**Bclymer**: All right, thanks, guys.
**Jdawson**: Thank you.
**Justin**: Fritz, you want to say pressure, stay for.
**Jdawson**: You want to test the accounting, the notion thing?
**Accounting**: I.
**Accounting**: I can't do it right now.
**Accounting**: I have to get started stuff.
**Accounting**: Yeah, you can go.
**Jdawson**: Bye.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: What I would suggest maybe take one of the timesheets from the spreadsheet, you know, for this week and try to input it into Notion and see how it.
**Accounting**: How it hits in akumatica.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Accounting**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: Use somebody's time that has different jobs maybe like.
**Jdawson**: And we can test it out.
**Jdawson**: So if you want free to.
**Jdawson**: Let's do it right now, if anything.
**Jdawson**: Don't worry, I can always, you know.
**Jdawson**: Thank you.
**Jdawson**: Fatima.
**Justin**: Don't forget to message me.
**Accounting**: Yes, I need to find.
**Jdawson**: Thank you.
**Accounting**: Yes, I saw your message this morning.
**Accounting**: Like, this girl is going to kill me.
**Accounting**: Yes, I need to find.
**Accounting**: I need to find a good one.
**Accounting**: Oh my God.
**Accounting**: But I'll.
**Accounting**: Yeah, just message me if you guys need anything.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Okay, bye.
**Jdawson**: Thank you.
**Jdawson**: Bye.
**Justin**: Sure.
**Jdawson**: All right, young ladies, so you want to go to Notion.
**Jdawson**: Let's share the screen.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Let me share.
**Justin**: I think it was Jacques who asked.
**Justin**: Wait, let me.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I already told him.
**Jdawson**: I told him no.
**Jdawson**: Your per teams are.
**Jdawson**: It shouldn't be taxable.
**Justin**: Okay, but I wasn't able to check yet in Venture since I.
**Justin**: I am only seeing.
**Justin**: So it's separate, right?
**Justin**: Like the payroll, the payout is separate report and then the reimbursement is a separate report as well.
**Jdawson**: Correct.
**Jdawson**: So whatever you can send me in the timesheet.
**Jdawson**: For example, if you want to send me the reimbursement, the per dms, everything on the timesheet will be.
**Jdawson**: I think last time you sent me like the totals and that was amaz because I think you sent me like Jack, this is a total of reimbursement.
**Jdawson**: This is the total of.
**Jdawson**: So that's good.
**Justin**: So you will be the one who asks approval to Jesse.
**Justin**: Sorry.
**Justin**: So I'll be asking Jesse instead of Brandon's approval right before sending it to you?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Or you can vote.
**Jdawson**: You can ask both.
**Jdawson**: So always check with Brandon.
**Jdawson**: Like, Brandon, are you available right now to approve or should I send it to Jesse and then just if he's.
**Jdawson**: If he said approved right away, perfect.
**Jdawson**: If not, ask him like, okay, sometimes he will say, I'm really busy right now, send it to Jesse and then just let.
**Jdawson**: No Jesse, like hey, Brandon just asked me to.
**Jdawson**: To send you this.
**Jdawson**: If you can please approve this asap.
**Jdawson**: That's it?
**Justin**: Yeah, because sometimes when I check, like when I check some of the timesheet, it's not filled out by the PM or pe.
**Justin**: So like there are pay period that there's no per diem data.
**Justin**: And then the next time we check on the next pay out, they filled out on the particular Date.
**Justin**: So I just added it and just mentioned that it was not included in the last payday period.
**Jdawson**: That's perfect.
**Jdawson**: That's perfect.
**Jdawson**: So go to accounting.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, let's go to accounting.
**Jdawson**: And then timesheets.
**Jdawson**: So that's a good question.
**Jdawson**: I don't know if that's the first one or the timesheets by projects though.
**Jdawson**: That's what we need to check.
**Jdawson**: But anyway, so here it is.
**Jdawson**: And then this is group by employee.
**Jdawson**: So if you want to test it out on Brandon or whatever, it's okay.
**Jdawson**: Or Jesse.
**Jdawson**: So let me see if we have ages.
**Jdawson**: Go back to the timesheet on notion.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: Scroll down.
**Jdawson**: Let's see if we have aj, Fatima.
**Justin**: Jesse.
**Justin**: Let me check if Jess is still.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, let's check and see.
**Justin**: This is not updated.
**Jdawson**: Oh.
**Justin**: But it's a lot, a lot of project.
**Jdawson**: Bless the collective word of Jesus.
**Justin**: Like for per day, he has a lot of project to allocate his hours.
**Jdawson**: But those are extra hours.
**Justin**: No, like, for example, I think he, like maybe he worked for this particular project since he is the VP or he's assisting the PM or pe.
**Justin**: So he's allocating this, his hour every day to a particular project.
**Jdawson**: Gotcha.
**Justin**: It's like that.
**Justin**: Okay, maybe we can test this one.
**Justin**: If it can be right.
**Justin**: Like here.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, so go to JC all the way up.
**Jdawson**: And then so if you start, for example, it says new.
**Jdawson**: New page.
**Jdawson**: You see right here.
**Justin**: Oh, yeah, sorry.
**Jdawson**: It's okay.
**Jdawson**: The plus.
**Jdawson**: And below that it says not started under aspires on Lucy.
**Jdawson**: You see the job name?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So below.
**Jdawson**: Below.
**Jdawson**: No, started.
**Jdawson**: There's something that says new page.
**Jdawson**: Click on it please.
**Jdawson**: Okay, there you go.
**Jdawson**: And then so the job.
**Jdawson**: So select what was the project he was working on.
**Jdawson**: So if you for example, put on job name.
**Jdawson**: No, that's going to take you time.
**Jdawson**: So click on job name.
**Jdawson**: No, not there, but the next.
**Jdawson**: So if you want to.
**Jdawson**: Exactly.
**Jdawson**: So click there and then look for the.
**Jdawson**: So he was working on Westfield Collective.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: So click on it.
**Jdawson**: Correct.
**Jdawson**: And then you see that immediately you got the job number.
**Jdawson**: Correct.
**Jdawson**: And then I don't know.
**Jdawson**: What is it?
**Justin**: Costco Vice president.
**Justin**: Can we.
**Justin**: Would it be possible if.
**Justin**: Because the Costco of the payroll is whatever their designation.
**Justin**: Like if.
**Justin**: If Jesse's.
**Justin**: For Jesse, he is a vice president.
**Justin**: And then for aj, he's a project manager.
**Justin**: So can we do that?
**Justin**: No need to fill out the Costco or something.
**Justin**: It will automatically link to whatever.
**Jdawson**: But you already did it, right?
**Jdawson**: So you already set up automatically.
**Justin**: No, we need to enter.
**Justin**: We need.
**Justin**: We need to still enter here.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, you need to.
**Jdawson**: Because you need to be connected.
**Jdawson**: But let's try to test it out first.
**Jdawson**: This one.
**Jdawson**: So March and then let's do.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: What was the hours he worked?
**Jdawson**: Probably March and then Selen.
**Jdawson**: What was that?
**Jdawson**: Pto.
**Jdawson**: Holiday Job related.
**Jdawson**: Correct.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And the number of times.
**Justin**: Oh my God.
**Justin**: But if he has a lot of number, then he will.
**Justin**: He will add a lot of.
**Jdawson**: Yes, you can.
**Jdawson**: And you can select based on projects.
**Jdawson**: So for example, he worked on Westfield Collective.
**Jdawson**: And then the next one, I think he was.
**Jdawson**: I don't remember, like Createscape.
**Jdawson**: So no, don't go to the job code.
**Jdawson**: Correct.
**Jdawson**: So go to the job number.
**Jdawson**: Exactly.
**Jdawson**: And then Goodwill Bloomington.
**Jdawson**: And then you go.
**Jdawson**: You already have the job number.
**Jdawson**: You can.
**Jdawson**: Exactly.
**Jdawson**: And then Vice president.
**Jdawson**: There you go.
**Jdawson**: Click on it.
**Jdawson**: I think you did right.
**Jdawson**: It's fine.
**Jdawson**: And then for the date, job related.
**Jdawson**: Correct a number of times.
**Jdawson**: Exactly.
**Jdawson**: And then Jesse.
**Jdawson**: And then name other one.
**Jdawson**: Exactly.
**Justin**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: Now I'm wondering.
**Jdawson**: So they should be able to do this, you know, instead of you guys doing it.
**Jdawson**: So you should be able to do it.
**Justin**: Yeah, they should, they should.
**Jdawson**: And then, and then once they're finished with that, you guys, before submitting, you guys should be the person like reviewing, just reviewing and then hit submit.
**Justin**: Actually they're the one to submit since they.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Justin**: Because they're the one who filled out as well, the Excel sheet.
**Justin**: So our job is just to get the data.
**Jdawson**: Gotcha.
**Justin**: So it's like they are the one to fill this out and then approve and.
**Justin**: And then it should be the report that you'll be seeing the data.
**Justin**: We.
**Justin**: We just need the data from.
**Justin**: From this.
**Jdawson**: And then, and then once it's approved, you will send me the spreadsheet to payroll or what would you suggest me to do?
**Jdawson**: What would you will be as your.
**Jdawson**: What will be easier for you.
**Justin**: Actually, since this is.
**Justin**: I am not sure if we can have that.
**Justin**: Yeah, maybe we can.
**Justin**: How can we like, can we filter?
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Justin**: After this.
**Justin**: Like if there is a per dime here.
**Justin**: Like they put the input per dime and then.
**Jdawson**: But 68 is dollar sign.
**Justin**: Yeah, that's money.
**Jdawson**: Correct.
**Jdawson**: So can you.
**Jdawson**: So I'm going to teach you.
**Jdawson**: So go to where it says per diem.
**Jdawson**: Title.
**Jdawson**: The title.
**Jdawson**: Click on it.
**Jdawson**: And then it says click where it says edit property.
**Jdawson**: Please click on it.
**Jdawson**: And then where it says type.
**Jdawson**: Where do you see?
**Jdawson**: Where it says type text.
**Jdawson**: There you go.
**Jdawson**: So click on it.
**Jdawson**: And then search where it says number.
**Jdawson**: You see where it says number below text.
**Jdawson**: Click on it and then that's it.
**Jdawson**: So that's.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So now you can leave that.
**Jdawson**: So you can close.
**Jdawson**: Exactly.
**Jdawson**: So now you can hit the 68.
**Jdawson**: But can you do the dollar sign?
**Jdawson**: I'll change that later.
**Jdawson**: But you can add the dollar sign if I'm not wrong.
**Jdawson**: There you go.
**Jdawson**: Nothing.
**Jdawson**: It's okay.
**Jdawson**: I'll go ahead and change it right now.
**Jdawson**: So we can make it.
**Jdawson**: We can add it like, you know, like a actual money instead of just, you know.
**Jdawson**: So why I'm not logged in.
**Jdawson**: That's kind of weird.
**Jdawson**: Okay, good.
**Jdawson**: All right, so let me go back here.
**Jdawson**: So this is accounting and then accounting and then time shifts by project.
**Jdawson**: And then you are doing Jesse.
**Jdawson**: So you're finishing Jesse's.
**Justin**: Or.
**Jdawson**: Or do you want just a test property?
**Justin**: And then if.
**Justin**: Would it be possible if we can have this format as well?
**Justin**: Just the question, because it's more like per employee.
**Justin**: And then this format.
**Jdawson**: One second.
**Jdawson**: I'm looking at it.
**Jdawson**: One second, please.
**Jdawson**: So US Dollars.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so this is US Dollars now.
**Jdawson**: And there you go.
**Jdawson**: Now you see that it's 68 and then zero.
**Jdawson**: Zero.
**Justin**: I am.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So you were telling me now what you were showing me.
**Jdawson**: Sorry, was it.
**Justin**: Yeah, it's a bit like if.
**Justin**: Like for.
**Justin**: If you're going with this format, it's more presentable or we can see directly the total number of hours or something like that.
**Jdawson**: They should be also total hours on the notion side.
**Justin**: Yeah, but it should be per project and then total number of hours per week or per period.
**Justin**: Because if he.
**Justin**: Yeah, because like for Jesse, he will enter one by one.
**Justin**: Unless if.
**Justin**: If it looks like this.
**Justin**: Where is it?
**Justin**: If the job name is already.
**Justin**: If the job is already enter, he will just put the number of hours here.
**Justin**: 1, 1.
**Justin**: So he will no longer enter again the job.
**Justin**: Because here he will enter March 31 and then April 1, he will enter all the jobs again here and then the next day, since he has a lot of job per day.
**Jdawson**: So this is per day.
**Justin**: Like March 24, he allocated his job for all this project and then another day, one hour, two hours.
**Justin**: So what I was thinking, if.
**Justin**: If it looks like this, like for March 31st, he will enter all the jobs one by one.
**Justin**: And then April 1st he will again enter this and then allocate the time and then for next day.
**Justin**: So if.
**Justin**: If it looks like this, if.
**Justin**: If it's possible that.
**Justin**: If.
**Justin**: If it looks like this, like the date is here and then the job and then you will just Enter the number of hours.
