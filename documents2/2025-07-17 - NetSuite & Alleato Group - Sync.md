## Transcript
**Jdawson**: Sam, this meeting is being recorded.
**Jdawson**: Andrew.
**Speaker 1**: Jesse.
**Speaker 1**: I'm doing well.
**Speaker 1**: How are you?
**Jdawson**: Good.
**Jdawson**: I made it today.
**Jdawson**: Sorry.
**Speaker 1**: Hey, no problem at all.
**Speaker 1**: I know things can come up.
**Speaker 1**: So glad we were able to reschedule for today and get back together here.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jdawson**: So this week I've been promised the videos will be ready and done so that we can launch the website.
**Jdawson**: So I'm pretty excited about that and I know I was.
**Jdawson**: Let me see if I can find this video.
**Jdawson**: I'll just show you because I think I described a little bit about what I'm doing.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, we had chatted a little bit about it.
**Speaker 1**: You mentioned that you're kind of starting the website and kind of getting production up and running and then.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I mean it was very exciting.
**Speaker 1**: I know this is for your personal business, so looking forward to kind of seeing where things are at and, and if there's anywhere that NetSuite can start supporting you here in the near future.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I mean we're just getting started, but eventually because you.
**Jdawson**: And again, it's the accounting.
**Jdawson**: It's.
**Jdawson**: It's kind of.
**Jdawson**: Is it.
**Jdawson**: It's the accounting and inventory and all that like into one.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So we'd consolidate everything into one basically from your accounting, your accounts payable, accounts receivable, inventory management.
**Speaker 1**: We can do everything from like payroll as well.
**Speaker 1**: I know you probably don't have anyone on the payroll at the moment, but if you know that does end up having, then netsuite can take care of that.
**Speaker 1**: And then also like anything that's like a CRM or somewhere that you want to store your customers.
**Speaker 1**: We can also consolidate kind of every aspect of the back end business as well as your CRM.
**Speaker 1**: So.
**Jdawson**: Okay, let me find this damn thing.
**Jdawson**: Let's see.
**Speaker 1**: You in Florida right now.
**Speaker 1**: I see the palm tree behind you.
**Jdawson**: Yes, very nice.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, it's pretty nice here.
**Speaker 1**: Are you in St. Pete or.
**Speaker 1**: I know we talked about it in the first call.
**Speaker 1**: It was like St. Peter, Clearwater area.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I live in Clearwater.
**Jdawson**: Our office is in St. Pete.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, very nice.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, so it's so it's not bad.
**Jdawson**: I mean it's like a half hour drive to get to work every day.
**Speaker 1**: Not too bad.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I still.
**Jdawson**: It's too far.
**Jdawson**: But a lot of people have it a lot worse like everywhere in, everywhere you go in.
**Jdawson**: If you go to Tampa, then you're talking hours a day.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: That's brutal.
**Jdawson**: Luckily I'm 10 guys.
**Speaker 1**: You're in Dallas, I'm in Austin, which is currently where.
**Speaker 1**: Headquarters.
**Jdawson**: But.
**Speaker 1**: But we're we're moving our headquarters to Nashville.
**Speaker 1**: So over the next like five.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so this is just the, this is the boat we're finishing up the Jet Ski.
**Jdawson**: Sorry, I'm trying to figure my computer out of here.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, no problem at all.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so how do I share?
**Jdawson**: Here we go.
**Speaker 1**: Share here at the bottom there.
**Jdawson**: Screen.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Make sure this volume isn't blaring.
**Speaker 1**: I can't hear the volume.
**Jdawson**: But again, so basically this.
**Jdawson**: So what it is, is you like, you can go up to like any shoreline anywhere and just launch your boat and.
**Jdawson**: And Jet ski, I've got, I've built one for.
**Jdawson**: I have two Jet Skis and two boats that I built prototypes for.
**Jdawson**: And it's just these rails made it.
**Jdawson**: So like you put them in the back and.
**Jdawson**: And then I have there, you know, the boat rides around on the regular carpeted bunks.
**Jdawson**: And then there's a jack, which I'm.
**Jdawson**: This is an electric one.
**Jdawson**: I also have a manual one.
**Jdawson**: It lifts the boat up off of the bunks and it also has rollers on it.
**Jdawson**: And then it just rolls your boat right off in the water.
**Speaker 1**: Wow, that's awesome.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that's the electric jack we use for it.
**Jdawson**: But like the remote, it kept screwing up on me and I had to put a longer winch.
**Jdawson**: But you just, you can stay on your boat the whole time.
**Jdawson**: You back up, get in your boat, you can let yourself out and pull yourself back on the trailer without even getting in the water.
**Speaker 1**: Wow.
**Speaker 1**: Wow, this is awesome.
**Speaker 1**: So did you get patents for this and everything and.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, you do.
**Jdawson**: And they're doing the international patent.
**Jdawson**: That'll be done like in a week or so.
**Jdawson**: I, I have attorneys working on that right now.
**Jdawson**: So I did the provisional in the US Just so I could start showing people it and stuff.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And.
**Jdawson**: But then the international patent, like, that'll cover the whole world.
**Jdawson**: It's going to be badass.
**Jdawson**: Oh yeah.
**Speaker 1**: That's awesome.
**Jdawson**: So that's why, like, we'll be shipping these things like all over the Canada U.S.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Like, you think like this is just a shoreline here in Florida, but there's literally850,000 lakes in the US or more and miles.
**Jdawson**: Millions of miles of River.
**Jdawson**: There's only 27, 000 boat ramps in the whole US so like people can take their boat anywhere.
**Jdawson**: Duck hunters, like the.
**Jdawson**: I had the.
**Jdawson**: Let's see where I got my.
**Jdawson**: So anyways, that we're just getting started.
**Jdawson**: I think it's going to be huge for like, you had that Flooding in Texas.
**Jdawson**: Like.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, yeah.
**Jdawson**: I made the first, like my second Jet Ski for like a policeman friend of mine.
**Jdawson**: He has a beach side that he patrols and like, when someone's drowning, there's nothing they can do.
**Jdawson**: Like.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, screwed.
**Jdawson**: But like, if you think about.
**Jdawson**: Let me find a picture of this Jet Ski.
**Jdawson**: But like, in Texas, like, they could have had like 50 teams of these because, like now they need like eight people to try and drag a boat off a trailer.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Whereas this like one.
**Jdawson**: One ranger or one of the rescue teams, you know, they could be one truck, one Jet ski, one boat, whatever, and be deployed all over the place and go right to where the people are drowning and dump their.
**Jdawson**: Put it in, go get the people, come out, go somewhere else, you know.
**Jdawson**: So that's why I'm gonna, you know, that's why I wanted to get this website done so that I can send something to the Texas Department of Emergency Services just to show them this is available for you guys.
**Jdawson**: You can go rescue people in anywhere instead of worrying about how you're going to get your boat in the water to go get them.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I'm.
**Speaker 1**: I'm curious.
**Speaker 1**: I mean, when are you planning on starting to go with sales?
**Jdawson**: Like Friday.
**Speaker 1**: On Friday.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Friday, when that website's live.
**Jdawson**: I've got like the call center set up now for.
**Jdawson**: So we can actually, I got.
**Jdawson**: It's just me.
**Jdawson**: So it's like.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I can't.
**Jdawson**: I was a little intimidated about getting it out there because it's like, how am I going to handle like.
**Jdawson**: Like all the people that want to call for this thing?
**Jdawson**: So that's the plan is Friday I'd be ready to go live with the website and then I'm gonna start sending it to like all the states that have floods.
**Jdawson**: But I want to find.
**Speaker 1**: So are you going to be targeting mostly like government.
**Speaker 1**: But to start.
**Jdawson**: I'm thinking I would like to just to help them out.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: You know, FEMA and all those, you know, departments that need, you know, the flood, especially for flood rescue watercraft.
**Jdawson**: It'll get them.
**Jdawson**: Get them set up first and then give me a little time to get ramped up on production for all the red, you know, the citizen.
**Jdawson**: Trying to see here, JD Desktop just so there's some.
**Jdawson**: Find some pictures here of the Jet Ski.
**Jdawson**: One second, hold on.
**Speaker 1**: Is this called Loan launcher?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah, that was the first one we built.
**Jdawson**: Like we bought this Jet Ski in Nebraska and well, for the Jet Ski anyway is.
**Jdawson**: But it's got.
**Jdawson**: It's very similar.
**Jdawson**: It's just a lot smaller.
**Jdawson**: This was a small jet Ski.
**Jdawson**: First one we did works badass.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, for sure.
**Jdawson**: We were launching them in sand pits.
**Jdawson**: So you can imagine a sand pit is like sand flat and then drops off a foot or two and then it's.
**Jdawson**: It's deep.
**Jdawson**: And.
**Speaker 1**: So do you build the whole trailer or is it just the.
**Jdawson**: The.
**Jdawson**: So I made it so you can bolt it on any trailer.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Like, we'll make.
**Jdawson**: We are manufacturing.
**Jdawson**: We have two place one in Nebraska, one here in Florida to manufacture all the parts and pieces.
**Jdawson**: And we can send a kit.
**Jdawson**: And then I'm going to set up, distribute.
**Jdawson**: You know, I got to set up dealerships, like with 10.
**Jdawson**: 10 boat dealers in each state that will put like, we'll get the customer, they want this on their trailer, they'll take it to that dealership, we'll send them the parts and then they'll put it on.
**Jdawson**: That's what I'm thinking would work best.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: You know, let me.
**Jdawson**: Let me show you.
**Jdawson**: This is what you probably need to see here.
**Jdawson**: So this John boat is that just to kind of show you the parts that we have.
**Jdawson**: I need to get this trailer.
**Jdawson**: Oh, it's CAD combined.
**Speaker 1**: Curious how much does it.
**Speaker 1**: One of these cost for like, for boats versus a jet ski or.
**Jdawson**: It all depends.
**Jdawson**: I'm trying to get it.
**Jdawson**: I think I can install probably around 2500 for a jet ski small boat if it doesn't have any power options.
**Jdawson**: If it's a manual jack, manual winch, then like the jet ski I did.
**Jdawson**: It's all.
**Jdawson**: It's got everything.
**Jdawson**: It's got a solar panel to keep the battery charged.
**Jdawson**: It's got an electric winch.
**Jdawson**: Electric battery like that adds another 2,000 probably to it between wiring, everything.
**Jdawson**: You know, the winches are almost 500 bucks just to buy them.
**Jdawson**: So like there's the deluxe version and you know, but that's what it seems like it's.
**Jdawson**: And I haven't got any.
**Jdawson**: You know, I did find a manufacturer, the rollers in Minnesota, that I can actually get them cheaper than buying them from China.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And then so that's why I just.
**Jdawson**: I gotta just line up those people when I'm buying in bulk.
**Jdawson**: I can, you know, bring my price down.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I'm going to work a deal out with Bass Pro, probably to just license it to them because.
**Jdawson**: And let them do it all for their.
**Jdawson**: All their new boats.
**Jdawson**: You know, all these John boats.
**Jdawson**: And you know, they own several different boat manufacturers.
**Jdawson**: Just so I'm not messing with that and then we can concentrate on.
**Jdawson**: Because there's like 27 million boats also in the U.S. yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: He's so, like, retrofitting.
**Jdawson**: Like, there's millions of trailers that, you know, that people will want to retrofit instead of buying a new trailer.
**Jdawson**: So, yeah, like, we can concert out manufacturing those parts.
**Jdawson**: And then I'll just work out deals with new boat manufacturers.
**Jdawson**: But like, these are basically the components of this thing.
**Jdawson**: You know, we'll have a bracket that you.
**Jdawson**: You know, we got a couple different designs on that that holds the rails while you're traveling to and from.
**Jdawson**: You know, these are a ramp rail, we call it.
**Jdawson**: There's two of those.
**Jdawson**: You know, we've redesigned this bracket.
**Jdawson**: It's so much better.
**Jdawson**: And I got bushings that just make it last a long time.
**Jdawson**: Keep it from aluminum, rub it on aluminum.
**Jdawson**: So brackets.
**Jdawson**: There is a bracket in the middle.
**Jdawson**: For this is the roller.
**Jdawson**: Like, this is what picks it up off of the bunks with the jack.
**Jdawson**: So there's several components that we like once we.
**Jdawson**: Because I've only designed it for four different styles of boat and jet ski.
**Jdawson**: Like, the jet skis are pretty much universal.
**Jdawson**: And like that.
**Jdawson**: John Boat and the jet ski.
**Jdawson**: We only had to modify a couple parts or else you could bolt one on either trailer, essentially, and it works.
**Jdawson**: So it's great that it's universal like that.
**Jdawson**: And this here.
**Jdawson**: So this.
**Jdawson**: Like to make this work.
**Jdawson**: Because a typical trailer just has this one cross member here, and the bunks go to it.
**Jdawson**: So because of.
**Jdawson**: To make this cantilever ramp work so that when the boat comes off it, you know, it comes off of the one and goes, you know, into the water.
**Jdawson**: You know, we have to add this rail.
**Jdawson**: And that's.
**Jdawson**: We've.
**Jdawson**: We've got that in a.
**Jdawson**: It bolts on.
**Jdawson**: Find that.
**Jdawson**: You know, the jet skis.
**Jdawson**: I've done this one.
**Jdawson**: We welded in a rail, but we also have brackets.
**Jdawson**: You can bolt that in as part of the kit.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Rail.
**Jdawson**: You got to add this battery box is.
**Jdawson**: I love it.
**Jdawson**: Because you can turn the power on and off to everything.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And keep everything charged with solar panel.
**Jdawson**: I've never had a problem.
**Jdawson**: It's like.
**Jdawson**: I don't use it every weekend or take it out, but it always stays charged just with this little 70 solar loop panel I think we bought.
**Jdawson**: But yeah.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that's it.
**Jdawson**: So you can see it.
**Jdawson**: You know, it's going.
**Jdawson**: I know it's going to be huge for people.
**Jdawson**: I know I grew up in Nebraska, and, like, if I could have had this, I could have fished five minutes from my home instead of driving for an hour.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, yeah.
**Speaker 1**: I mean it's awesome.
**Speaker 1**: It seems like it's going to be a great product.
**Speaker 1**: I'm gonna hopefully see it all over Lake Austin here soon.
**Jdawson**: You will.
**Speaker 1**: Especially if we're launching next week or I mean on Friday.
**Speaker 1**: Hopefully.
**Jdawson**: Hopefully.
**Speaker 1**: I go out there in a couple weeks and I, I, I, I noticed the trailers.
**Speaker 1**: So.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, so yeah, the guy that's doing my website also has a marketing company so he knows like that's what he does.
**Jdawson**: He's marketing.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I got an app coming out too where it's, it's, then he's, he's got that almost done.
**Jdawson**: It's going to allow people to like rent out their lake if they want.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, like airbnb almost.
**Jdawson**: So because now that people can just drive up and put their watercraft into their lake now they can rent that access.
**Jdawson**: So I'm going to have that as well.
**Jdawson**: So that'll be coming out and yeah, it'll be coming out soon.
**Jdawson**: So there's where like now that hopefully you understand like what it is like if you like now if you can tailor.
**Jdawson**: As soon as I can afford it, I want to get something in place that is going to be able to expand like as the business grows.
**Jdawson**: I think it's going to blow up and so I'm going to have to have be able to, to, you know, coordinate all the deliveries with, you know, if there's 10 to 20 dealers in every state that's, you know, a thousand people, I'm going to have to coordinate shipments of parts and pieces to.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, the inventory is not overly crazy but there's going to be 100 different parts or so.
**Jdawson**: So organizing that and yeah, yeah.
**Speaker 1**: And I think we're in a good spot.
**Speaker 1**: I think I'm glad that you reached out to us early.
**Speaker 1**: I mean I think going through a full blown evaluation here in, in the near future like once you started blowing up.
**Speaker 1**: I do think this business seems like it's going to be something that kind of spreads like wildfire.
**Speaker 1**: So it's definitely going to be cool to see, see that happen.
**Speaker 1**: And I think, you know, just starting on a netsuite platform, we have something that's called starter.
**Speaker 1**: I can send you some information on that.
**Speaker 1**: But we have everything from like field service management and I don't necessarily think you'll need that from you know, day one or like obviously you'd be doing a lot with inventory and I'm not sure that you're going to have people like going out and do the deliveries themselves.
**Speaker 1**: It'll probably be like a third party company that's probably doing a lot of that.
**Speaker 1**: But I mean, if it does grow to the point where you have a bunch of employees and you're doing your own shipments and doing things like that, like netsuite will be able to grow with you.
**Speaker 1**: We do have like ways to track your own drivers.
**Speaker 1**: Track like all of the inventory in that, in that shipment, like where those drivers are, like how far away they are from those dealers in different states.
**Speaker 1**: So we have a lot of different options and would love to kind of like dive deeper into that once kind of the business is up and running and you're ready to kind of explore those things.
**Speaker 1**: Just curious, like from, from day one, I'd assume you're probably looking at like a QuickBooks or something like that.
**Speaker 1**: To start with the CR, I mean with the ERP system is that probably.
**Jdawson**: I don't have anything, right?
**Speaker 1**: You don't have anything.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So my sister, she's the accountant, she's got it.
**Jdawson**: I have a company called JRD Manufacturing.
**Jdawson**: So that's Jesse Riskandella, that's my nephew.
**Jdawson**: And Riskin is the guy that did all the CAD drawings.
**Jdawson**: He worked with me to fabricate the prototypes.
**Jdawson**: And so my sister, she's a business manager of a Ford dealership.
**Jdawson**: So she's the business person.
**Jdawson**: And so, you know, she knows QuickBooks and she knows how to do all that.
**Jdawson**: But again, I don't want to, like, I don't know how small.
**Jdawson**: I can start with Oracle knowing it's going to be a big thing.
**Speaker 1**: Absolutely.
**Jdawson**: Instead of switching like mid, mid, you know, stream to a different system instead of just growing it, you know.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: And I think that's, that's a good thought process.
**Speaker 1**: Like, obviously, you know, especially when business is exploding, you want to go, you don't want to go and move everything off QuickBooks onto another ERP system.
**Speaker 1**: Typically those, you know, those transfers can take months or, or even longer.
**Speaker 1**: So I think, you know, starting on even NetSuite starter package and, and kind of ramping up from there would probably be in, in the best interest there.
**Speaker 1**: Just curious.
**Speaker 1**: All right, what, so is the, is the company going to be called Loan Launcher or do you have a different.
**Jdawson**: The Loan Launcher is an llc.
**Jdawson**: That's the, for the patent.
**Jdawson**: That's just, that's all mine.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And then JRD is the company that, you know, all of the, all of the orders and the, you know, the, the sales of these will go through jrd.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, got it.
**Speaker 1**: It's JRD Manufacturing or just jrd.
**Jdawson**: JRD Manufacturing.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So it's a LLC in Florida.
**Speaker 1**: Awesome.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I mean, I'd love to kind of continue conversations.
**Speaker 1**: I can send you any videos on Starter so you can start taking a look at kind of what that would look like and getting up and running on that.
**Speaker 1**: And then from there, I mean, I mean, I'm looking forward to kind of see the website coming out.
**Speaker 1**: So.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I'll send you a link to it.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, once that's popping out on, on Friday, I would love to see it and go check it out there.
**Speaker 1**: So.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, and my sister.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, you.
**Jdawson**: I'll send you her address because she'll know more about the accounting, whatever it is you're sending.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, absolutely.
**Jdawson**: And how much is that?
**Jdawson**: Like when it's just the bare basic getting started?
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, we can start you.
**Speaker 1**: I mean, Starter, we can get to.
**Speaker 1**: It's.
**Speaker 1**: It's usually like 15k for the year, first starter edition, which I would think that, you know, after you guys sell quite a few units and if it does spread pretty quickly, then, then you guys will have some capital there to, to start looking at it.
**Speaker 1**: And obviously like, this is a brand new business.
**Speaker 1**: I want your business.
**Speaker 1**: So we have some flexibility there with pricing.
**Speaker 1**: But, you know, once we have further conversations as to what your needs are, then I'd be better able to kind of talk over what we can do from a pricing standpoint.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jdawson**: I'm always like, people that help me out getting this started are definitely the people that I take care of.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
**Speaker 1**: And I think, I think you're gonna be in a good spot here the next six months.
**Speaker 1**: I mean, I feel like this just showing me everything that, that you got built out and everything that you've been working on over the past past few years.
**Speaker 1**: It's.
**Speaker 1**: It's a cool little product and I could see this is really blowing up.
**Speaker 1**: So it's going to be fun to watch.
**Jdawson**: Hell yeah.
**Jdawson**: It's.
**Jdawson**: I'm excited like, you know, because it's like a year ago that first day I launched myself out on our first prototype and I'm like, yeah, hell yeah.
**Jdawson**: This is gonna be crazy.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Speaker 1**: So yeah, I mean, especially it's at boat docks, you just see like all like people pulling up.
**Speaker 1**: Especially in Austin.
**Speaker 1**: There's this one that's called 360 loop and you see people waiting hours to get their boat on the water.
**Speaker 1**: It's just like, you know, if you could launch from anywhere.
**Speaker 1**: Imagine how much more often than you'd want to be on the water and not have to, you know, get out there.
**Jdawson**: The people.
**Jdawson**: Because the people.
**Jdawson**: Jet skis.
**Jdawson**: There's places where you can go to.
**Jdawson**: To launch, you know, but they will almost submerge their vehicle in the water to get the jet ski off the trailer because they got it back so far in water.
**Jdawson**: And here you don't even.
**Jdawson**: Like with mine, you don't even put the trailer in the water.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, the trailers, like, the wheels, like, don't even touch the water sometimes, depending on how deep it drops off.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: And those and the salt water will just absolutely annihilate.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, yeah.
**Jdawson**: So these people are just ruining their vehicle.
**Jdawson**: It's.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, they're gonna be.
**Jdawson**: It's an easy sell for that.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, absolutely.
**Speaker 1**: I'm looking forward to seeing it.
**Speaker 1**: It on the market here, Jesse.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, it's coming one week away.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Awesome.
**Speaker 1**: Well, I will follow up here shortly.
**Speaker 1**: If you want to send your sister's email over so I can just send the video to both of you, then.
**Speaker 1**: Then I'd.
**Speaker 1**: I'd be happy to do that.
**Speaker 1**: And then once I'll send it to you, site's out running.
**Speaker 1**: I'm looking forward to looking at it.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And I'll send it to you from my loan launcher email.
**Speaker 1**: Perfect.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, that sounds great.
**Jdawson**: Okay, awesome.
**Speaker 1**: I appreciate your time and looking forward to seeing this thing launch.
**Jdawson**: Hell, yeah.
**Jdawson**: Me too.
**Jdawson**: All right.
