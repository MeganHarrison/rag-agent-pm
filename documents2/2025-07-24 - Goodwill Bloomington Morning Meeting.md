## Transcript
**Jcurtin**: Good morning, Jack.
**Jcurtin**: Hey, Jack, you're on mute.
**Jdawson**: Can you hear me?
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, I can hear you.
**Jdawson**: Hey, morning, Nick.
**Jdawson**: Good morning, Justin.
**Jcurtin**: Good morning.
**Jcurtin**: How's it going today?
**Jdawson**: It's going well.
**Jdawson**: McRae & Sons is already out here prepping for, for our good old footing inspection today.
**Jdawson**: Take place at 10 o' clock and then Bloomington lined up for testing right behind it.
**Jcurtin**: Nice.
**Jcurtin**: How are things going on the canopy?
**Jdawson**: Good.
**Jdawson**: That's going to get inspected today as well?
**Jdawson**: Well, slight chance.
**Jdawson**: The city said that the inspector may have enough time to inspect both.
**Jdawson**: I mean, I imagine that they, they would, but she said if not, then she'll come back and inspect the canopy and inside the donation vestibule tomorrow.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, the electrician was able to get all his lights in on the canopy?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah, he roughed, he roughed everything in.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, he's ready.
**Jcurtin**: And McRae's all good to go as far as the dowels for the footing for, for the concrete pour.
**Jcurtin**: Is that tomorrow?
**Jdawson**: The concrete pour?
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Now the pour will be today as well.
**Jcurtin**: Oh, it's today.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: But they're all good with their dowel locations.
**Jdawson**: McRae and Rock Solid.
**Jdawson**: I had them meet out here.
**Jdawson**: We all coordinated together.
**Jdawson**: We walked it Rock Solid originally.
**Jdawson**: Did like a drawing as well, like a sketch drawing to explain it.
**Jdawson**: Rockaw's out here again this morning, so they're on site here too.
**Jdawson**: They're making some adjustments at the donation vestibule opening where that brick is.
**Jdawson**: But yeah, and then I did have another conversation with them about, you know, it's too late in the ball game to be asking if they can, you know, like the, the con.
**Jdawson**: The stem, the wall, the concrete wall has to be bumped out like it was before.
**Jdawson**: So I know.
**Jdawson**: That was another thing I talked with you about with them.
**Jdawson**: I told them that to do it per the drawings and they said, okay.
**Jcurtin**: Is there anything else going on?
**Jcurtin**: On?
**Jdawson**: Just electricians working in the receiving area, tying things into the electrical room from their.
**Jdawson**: All their drops in the receiving area.
**Jdawson**: Painters are back today.
**Jdawson**: Glenmark, like we talked about at one point, they knew they had to do their, their, their drywall touch up and they tried to separate their drywall touch up to quote, unquote, trade damages.
**Jdawson**: There isn't any crazy trade damages in those rooms.
**Jdawson**: So I talked Glenmark out of that.
**Jdawson**: This whole like, well, some of it's going to be trade damages.
**Jdawson**: And it's just like if, you know, everybody's done in there, just, you know, they, we work something out and they, they agreed to just do touch up and no extra charge or none of that crap.
**Jdawson**: And so they finished that up this week.
**Jdawson**: And painters are back today to start painting the rooms, start putting final paint in those rooms and then they're gonna work their way out of the room.
**Jdawson**: And if you're standing at the rooms with the doctor to your back, they're gonna work their way left and start painting the plywood and chair rail and baseboard.
**Jdawson**: But holding off on any CMU or plywood over there where we're going to be making a mess, tearing up drywall and making frames for windows and everything like that.
**Jdawson**: I've let them know to hold off painting over there.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: And I think, oh, we're just gonna go with, with the 12 inch awnings.
**Jcurtin**: So.
**Jcurtin**: Klein, Mark, are they.
**Jcurtin**: Did you say something, jdawson?
**Ksipe**: What's that?
**Jcurtin**: Oh, I thought you said something.
**Jcurtin**: No, Glenmark.
**Jcurtin**: Dude, did they say they have any lead time on, on their steel?
**Jdawson**: Not quite yet there.
**Jdawson**: The engineer hasn't even got back with them about those 12 inch, about having to build a whole new wall because we're doing the 12 inch awning.
**Jdawson**: So that was another reason why I saw an opportunity to still do the 7 inch awnings with those.
**Jdawson**: Just a slightly small project, smaller projection.
**Jdawson**: Was that, was that, was that why y' all want.
**Jdawson**: Was that why we're staying with the 12 inch?
**Jdawson**: Because we're thinking maybe Glenmark can hurry up and get their material out here or.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, we're, we're hoping we, we can just get started on that activity just so there's, there's no delays.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, unfortunately not.
**Jdawson**: Like I said, the Mason's pulling up 17.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So no, Glenmark doesn't have any answer back from the engineer right now.
**Jdawson**: So we're still basically we're at the same stage.
**Jdawson**: If we were to, you know, have an audible and go towards the 7 inch awnings or if we were to continue the 12 inch, like even just continuing the 12 inch doesn't really benefit.
**Jdawson**: If anything, that's going to take longer from the engineer because they have to actually see how the engineer wants them to do it.
**Jdawson**: But with just going on the tube steel, they already have an idea of how to do it and they already assuming what the engineer is going to say.
**Jdawson**: So just staying with the 12 inch actually doesn't at this time is not really benefiting us in any kind of time duration.
**Jdawson**: And the awning place hasn't even made the 12 inches yet.
**Jdawson**: So like that's another thing.
**Jdawson**: If they would already make the 12 inch vertical links then it's like, okay, we're definitely not going to ask them to make some new ones.
**Jdawson**: But they haven't even made the 12 inch ones.
**Jcurtin**: Well, what do you, what do you think on this, jdawson?
**Ksipe**: I don't like making them too skinny.
**Ksipe**: The support, you got less support.
**Ksipe**: More, more shear force and tilt force on them.
**Ksipe**: Like, why are we.
**Ksipe**: Doesn't sound like there's any reason to change from having them at least 12 inches.
**Jdawson**: I mean, I was just thinking if we shortened up the projection a little bit, it would make sense with the vertical length shortening.
**Jdawson**: But I was.
**Jdawson**: Thank you.
**Ksipe**: We can't change the projection.
**Ksipe**: That's part of, part of the city's requirements is we have the awnings that project the same amount they did before.
**Jdawson**: Okay, well, that was my, that was my question to you yesterday when I called.
**Jdawson**: Was it was, were those measurements like locked in?
**Jdawson**: We had to have them that way, so.
**Jdawson**: Well, never mind then.
**Jdawson**: I was just trying to think of a way we could still audible this and save that 20 grand that, that Glenmark wants to be able to build a wall above the two tube steel.
**Jdawson**: It sounds like there's, there's nothing we can do.
**Jdawson**: That's all.
**Jdawson**: That's all.
**Jdawson**: I was just trying to find a way to still accomplish everything and save the money.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: And for the utility vault work, I, I sent an email to Andrew.
**Jcurtin**: Obviously he's on vacation right now.
**Jcurtin**: I'll probably give a, a call to Joe with Hawk holdings today and see what the status is on that.
**Jcurtin**: And then on the paint design, I sent approval, sent an email to Andrew to get approval for just making a bigger stripe where they're going to order a bigger sign at the entrance.
**Jcurtin**: So hopefully he's, he's okay with that.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: You have anything else going on today, Jack?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, if you could just reiterate to Joe.
**Jdawson**: I mean, I don't think the city's gonna let me get a TCO without that with that water vault being done.
**Jcurtin**: Yep.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, I'll talk to him.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: No, no, I walked with Steve at inline painting and they're gonna, they'll get a little bit of a, they'll get a charge for sprinkler heads having pain on them.
**Jdawson**: I have fire sprinkler guys.
**Jdawson**: They'll, they'll change out the ones that have paint on them and put them all in a big box.
**Jdawson**: But I mean, I told Steve, you know, he understood.
**Jdawson**: And their third party subcontractor explained to me like, they did cover.
**Jdawson**: I was like, I understand.
**Jdawson**: Like, I did see him put aluminum foil on it.
**Jdawson**: But if they didn't tell me that some of them had paint on them before they cover them, there's no, like, I can't sit here and just, like, take it for word.
**Jdawson**: And they understood, like, so they.
**Jdawson**: They knew that, like, their painters, if there were some that already had paint on from a previous paint job, they should have, like, raised their hand and told me.
**Jdawson**: So that's that on that.
**Jdawson**: But, yeah, good to go.
**Jdawson**: Not expecting right now.
**Jdawson**: No, no, crazy.
**Jdawson**: Change orders right now to finish this thing off.
**Jdawson**: CSC is moving good.
**Jdawson**: Their previous fire alarm devices were not leveled, so I told them that it wasn't going to fly.
**Jdawson**: Didn't look good, and they switched out the devices and had them level on the joist, so I was good to go.
**Jdawson**: Well, yeah, that's all I got for right now.
**Jdawson**: The bathroom signage for the men's and women's restroom.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, I'm pretty sure that was on Goodwill's list for things that they're providing.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: I gave Andrew the cost of 75 an hour to see if he'll approve that, and then Glenmark will have two guys to install all that stuff.
**Jdawson**: Right on.
**Jcurtin**: All right, well, I'll talk to you guys later.
**Jcurtin**: All right, see you.
**Jdawson**: Thanks.
