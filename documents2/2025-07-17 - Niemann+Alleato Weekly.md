**Sclevenger**: Oh, yeah.
**Cmortensen**: Yeah, we do.
**Cmortensen**: You know, this.
**Cmortensen**: It's hard for us to stay competitive on, you know, anything under a million.
**Cmortensen**: I would say.
**Sclevenger**: Yeah.
**Cmortensen**: But, you know, we obviously care about the relationship, so this one, I had the relationship with.
**Cmortensen**: With Nissing, who introduced us to you guys, and so that's how we ended up doing this one.
**Sclevenger**: And how.
**Sclevenger**: How far do you guys go out?
**Cmortensen**: We're nationwide, so we have a Tampa Bay office, and we have our headquarters here in Indy.
**Cmortensen**: But, you know, I got, like, me personally, I have projects.
**Cmortensen**: I'm looking at one in California, and I got one in Tennessee and Vegas.
**Cmortensen**: And you name it, we go there.
**Cmortensen**: So Jesse Dawson, who you've met, he.
**Cmortensen**: He holds our NASCA for us, so we're pretty much licensed in every state.
**Sclevenger**: Okay.
**Sclevenger**: Okay.
**Cmortensen**: So next one you got coming up.
**Sclevenger**: Yeah, I'll keep you in mind.
**Cmortensen**: Yeah, I want to crack at it.
**Sclevenger**: Okay, let's.
**Cmortensen**: Let's get this one started.
**Sclevenger**: Yeah, yeah, yeah, that'd be good.
**Cmortensen**: So the only.
**Cmortensen**: The only update I have, you know, we had that meeting, I think it was Tuesday morning with FedEx.
**Cmortensen**: Alex has almost got that schedule wrapped up.
**Cmortensen**: And, you see, I told them, you know, I'm pushing us back.
**Sclevenger**: Right.
**Cmortensen**: I know.
**Cmortensen**: They said a September 1st date.
**Cmortensen**: We're obviously not going to meet that.
**Cmortensen**: Yeah, we're gonna kick ass to get it done by that second week of September, hopefully.
**Sclevenger**: Yeah.
**Cmortensen**: But I haven't gotten the permit yet.
**Cmortensen**: Now I'm looking at.
**Cmortensen**: I emailed Christina yesterday.
**Cmortensen**: She hasn't responded yet, but she's on record in an email saying there's no more comments.
**Cmortensen**: So I think it's just a paperwork processing thing.
**Cmortensen**: So we're tentatively gonna schedule our concrete cutter for sometime next week.
**Cmortensen**: But I'm giving them till the end of day to day and I'll let we find out.
**Cmortensen**: Okay.
**Sclevenger**: Okay.
**Sclevenger**: Yeah, that'd be great.
**Sclevenger**: Sean had a couple questions.
**Sclevenger**: She wanted to know if the city will issue addresses when they issue the building permit or if they don't, then who are is our best contact with the city to get some addresses.
**Cmortensen**: Are you guys want, are you guys wanting to keep the same address and just have like suite one, suite two, suite three?
**Sclevenger**: Or I would, I would assume that.
**Sclevenger**: That, I would assume, but maybe, maybe Sean doesn't usually do it that way.
**Sclevenger**: I'll have to.
**Sclevenger**: Claire, I'll have to clarify with her.
**Cmortensen**: I, I don't have an answer for you, but I can find out.
**Cmortensen**: So I'll do some digging.
**Cmortensen**: I, I, I don't want to open up a can of worms with the city if it takes a whole lot of effort to get a whole new address.
**Cmortensen**: So if we can just be like paint or put stickers, you know, Sweet one, sweet two.
**Cmortensen**: And, and people are going to know too, you know, deliver to FedEx.
**Sclevenger**: Right.
**Cmortensen**: But, right, okay.
**Cmortensen**: We'll get all that.
**Cmortensen**: I'll do some digging.
**Sclevenger**: Okay, that sounds good.
**Sclevenger**: Yeah.
**Sclevenger**: I think that's the only thing Sean wanted to know.
**Sclevenger**: She, she's off today and tomorrow, so she wasn't gonna make it to the meeting.
**Sclevenger**: But other than that, I don't think, I don't think I.
**Sclevenger**: Is there anything you need from me?
**Cmortensen**: No, we're good.
**Cmortensen**: We're just, I mean, I know you guys are itching to start.
**Cmortensen**: I think we even more itching to start because we've had a warehouse full of material that I wanna, I wanna bill for, so.
**Sclevenger**: Right, right, right.
**Sclevenger**: Yeah, I can understand that.
**Cmortensen**: Yeah.
**Cmortensen**: I got guys calling me, like, when are we gonna start?
**Cmortensen**: So we're, we're ramping up.
**Cmortensen**: We're gonna hopefully be balls to the wall next week.

**Bclymer**: I know, and I walked it.
**Bclymer**: And I'm planning on when.
**Bclymer**: When we actually get rocking and rolling.
**Bclymer**: Tim and I are gonna be searching for it, but if somebody knows the location, who the provider is.
**Sclevenger**: Right.
**Bclymer**: That'll save us, right?
**Sclevenger**: Yeah, I'll.
**Sclevenger**: I'll get with our IT Director and see.
