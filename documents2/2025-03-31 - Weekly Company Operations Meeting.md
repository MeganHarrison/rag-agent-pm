**Njepson**: I can hear you.
**Gducharme**: Okay, so let me see if you have.
**Gducharme**: I'M on my phone right now.
**Gducharme**: So I went through and I updated everything.
**Gducharme**: Maria.
**Njepson**: Yeah, I saw that.
**Njepson**: Thank you so much for that.
**Njepson**: I saw that.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Gducharme**: I have guys walking through.
**Gducharme**: I'm doing a job site walk right now so I wanted to hop on and we can go through mine real quick.
**Gducharme**: Which one?
**Gducharme**: So first.
**Gducharme**: First one would be R and D group.
**Njepson**: Okay, that's on that one.
**Njepson**: You already updated it.
**Njepson**: That's good.
**Gducharme**: I did.
**Gducharme**: Yep.
**Gducharme**: So no update.
**Gducharme**: The update is no update.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Njepson**: Great clips.
**Gducharme**: Great clips.
**Gducharme**: Madison.
**Gducharme**: Yep.
**Gducharme**: So I got photos from the broker.
**Gducharme**: We're currently working on a sketch to put it in cad and great clips will do that.
**Gducharme**: So that's something that I gotta get done here probably tomorrow.
**Gducharme**: I made sure I put a date on which on the task.
**Gducharme**: I have to have them done by perfect Neiman.
**Gducharme**: Second tenant.
**Gducharme**: Don't think that.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Gducharme**: So the news is no news there.
**Gducharme**: They.
**Gducharme**: They picked.
**Gducharme**: They chose not to move forward with the current client.
**Gducharme**: So that job's just on pause until they find another tenant for that space.
**Njepson**: Okay, that's still there.
**Gducharme**: Yep.
**Gducharme**: Moving on to my next one is Longhorn demo and okay.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Gducharme**: So I was with Jake all day on Friday.
**Gducharme**: They're moving forward with the land lease on this project.
**Gducharme**: That being said, he gave me the number we have to be at.
**Gducharme**: At 700, 000 or around there.
**Gducharme**: So right now I got to talk to the civil engineer, come up with a couple design design, I guess ideas to try and get this within budget and then confirm a couple things.
**Gducharme**: He's getting a Geotech done.
**Gducharme**: So once he gets that Geotech done, we'll be able to determine how much of the okay parking lot we can still use.
**Gducharme**: So.
**Njepson**: Okay, sounds good.
**Gducharme**: Yep.
**Gducharme**: So I got released.
**Gducharme**: I sent them all the path pricing.
**Gducharme**: We're good to go on there.
**Gducharme**: We just need to make sure we get the right approvals for the city.
**Gducharme**: And so I'm meeting with the civil engineer Wednesday morning and I'm going to see exactly what else we need there.
**Gducharme**: I don't think we need much.
**Gducharme**: He seems to think we do.
**Gducharme**: So tomorrow I made it a high priority.
**Gducharme**: I'm going to be trying to get a hold of the city to find out exactly what it is they're after for our permit.
**Bclymer**: What's the total value of that going to be?
**Gducharme**: 100.
**Gducharme**: 100k.
**Bclymer**: So that's exterior and interior.
**Gducharme**: No, interior is a separate budget.
**Gducharme**: I think in total it'll end up only being like 125.
**Gducharme**: Brandon.
**Gducharme**: That's all the money they could raise.
**Bclymer**: What do we got on that?
**Gducharme**: I would say around 20 grand.
**Gducharme**: Between internal contingency.
**Gducharme**: Internal contingency I plugged.
**Gducharme**: And our fee that doesn't include a couple weeks of gcs.
**Bclymer**: The.
**Bclymer**: There is that budget.
**Bclymer**: Live inside the folder somewhere.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, you'll be able to see it.
**Bclymer**: This is an estimating or.
**Gducharme**: Yep, it'd be an estimating.
**Gducharme**: Go to the very bottom.
**Gducharme**: So my internal contingency is the site work.
**Gducharme**: And I beefed up their numbers a little bit with the.
**Gducharme**: With the site surveying.
**Gducharme**: So the two that they're after, the 290 grand ones, so I can do one path or the other portion, they're going to hold off on the concrete portion.
**Bclymer**: So when I go to the bottom and I click on Corindeo Academy, I don't see.
**Bclymer**: Oh, the path.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: That's what you're calling it.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Gducharme**: Go to path.
**Bclymer**: So Corndale asphalt path.
**Gducharme**: There should be.
**Gducharme**: Should be a concrete one and there should be one that's like 600 foot on my computer in front of me or I'd walk you through it.
**Bclymer**: So this is.
**Bclymer**: This one that I'm looking at is for 87,000.
**Gducharme**: Yep.
**Gducharme**: Should be just under 90,000.
**Bclymer**: I thought he says 100.
**Gducharme**: Said with.
**Gducharme**: With our interior work, it's going to be around 120.
**Bclymer**: Gotcha.
**Bclymer**: So asphalt demo with combs.
**Bclymer**: Com.
**Bclymer**: So you got 2500 internal contingency plus 2500.
**Gducharme**: I fluffed up a couple of those numbers.
**Gducharme**: Brandon, look here, let me pull it up.
**Bclymer**: So right now it looks like roughly 10 grand on it then.
**Gducharme**: Well, with our fee.
**Gducharme**: What's our fee at?
**Bclymer**: That's what I'm saying.
**Bclymer**: With the, with the internal fee, the fee is 5,000.
**Bclymer**: So that's 10 total.
**Dmacari**: Yeah.
**Gducharme**: I'm not sure which one you're looking at.
**Gducharme**: I'll have to look here.
**Gducharme**: One second.
**Bclymer**: I mean, the Latest one, the 317.
**Gducharme**: I know, but there should be two separate path ones.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, there's a concrete path one.
**Bclymer**: Which one are we doing, the concrete or asphalt?
**Gducharme**: Well, so there's three separate ones.
**Gducharme**: There's concrete and there's two.
**Gducharme**: There's two asphalt ones.
**Gducharme**: So one.
**Gducharme**: Okay, so this one's the one along College Avenue and then there's another one that's along Congressional.
**Bclymer**: So which one are we doing?
**Gducharme**: Either of them.
**Gducharme**: I had to get both of them to 90 grand.
**Gducharme**: Whichever one the city wants is going to make them do first.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: You got one week of p.m.
**Bclymer**: it looks like.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Gducharme**: So that'll be.
**Gducharme**: We'll strip the topsoil.
**Gducharme**: We'll get it staked, strip the topsoil in a day or two, and then it'll be stone a day and then a day of land.
**Gducharme**: So it's not really not much work.
**Gducharme**: Okay, so surveying is.
**Gducharme**: Is where I'm meeting with the civil designer to see what his price is going to be.
**Gducharme**: But I got prices for the whole kitten caboodle at like 8, $500.
**Bclymer**: From.
**Gducharme**: That Jeff Trout guy.
**Gducharme**: But if we're just doing.
**Gducharme**: Breaking that into thirds, I plugged seven grand.
**Gducharme**: That number is gonna.
**Gducharme**: I'm gonna be able to buy that out for less.
**Gducharme**: So I plan on a little internal contingency there.
**Gducharme**: And then the testing number, Brandon, I left in there.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Gducharme**: Oh, no, that.
**Gducharme**: This one's not the concrete one.
**Dmacari**: Scroll down here.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, the earthwork's not going to be that much.
**Gducharme**: That was the price for the whole thing.
**Speaker 6**: So.
**Gducharme**: And then I have a little bit of internal contingency there.
**Gducharme**: So on the paths we're.
**Gducharme**: We're making, probably, I would say probably 15 grand on just one of the paths would be my goal.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: And then they haven't decided what they want to do on the interior yet.
**Gducharme**: Depends on what their capital committee comes back with here at the end of the month.
**Bclymer**: Okay, what's next?
**Gducharme**: Next one is for me would be Sunset.
**Gducharme**: Yep.
**Gducharme**: Sunset Plaza.
**Gducharme**: Yep.
**Gducharme**: So met with Rockford.
**Gducharme**: They're delayed on building.
**Gducharme**: Go ahead, Brandon.
**Bclymer**: They say hard pricing.
**Bclymer**: It shows due March 5th.
**Gducharme**: I can't, I can't.
**Gducharme**: If you look up follow up on landlord, I can't do the hard pricing until they send me Rockford's drawings in the landlord scope.
**Gducharme**: Balls in their court on that one.
**Njepson**: Okay, you want me to change it, A.J.
**Njepson**: to what time?
**Njepson**: To what date?
**Njepson**: Sorry, like an estimate time next week?
**Gducharme**: Yeah, I mean, you need to.
**Bclymer**: You need to put it as, you know, Maria, you need to show it as is.
**Bclymer**: It's dependent upon, you know, the.
**Bclymer**: The landlord scope.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Gducharme**: Correct.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So you'll want to, you know, you can.
**Bclymer**: No, you don't want to edit the property.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: But here.
**Njepson**: Right.
**Gducharme**: I was.
**Gducharme**: I wasn't sure how to do that, Maria, when I was entering these.
**Njepson**: Yeah, go ahead and edit.
**Bclymer**: Put it, put it as a note and either I can show you later or you can Google it.
**Bclymer**: But let's keep moving.
**Njepson**: We can edit right now.
**Njepson**: So what's the one?
**Njepson**: So instead let's do it as in progress.
**Njepson**: Which one?
**Njepson**: You said depending on.
**Bclymer**: No, that's not.
**Bclymer**: You're not in the right section.
**Njepson**: Oh, which one?
**Njepson**: Because we can add the steps here.
**Bclymer**: Look, so you don't need to know that.
**Bclymer**: Don't go.
**Bclymer**: Get rid of that.
**Bclymer**: Stop.
**Gducharme**: Back.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Escape.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So you go click on.
**Bclymer**: Click on hard.
**Bclymer**: Click on the open part where it says hard pricing.
**Bclymer**: Open.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And then you can say so at the top there, press the plus, add a property so it'll show.
**Njepson**: Oh, here.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: And then.
**Bclymer**: So you scroll down.
**Njepson**: To which one to.
**Bclymer**: You want to look forward?
**Bclymer**: No, not.
**Bclymer**: No, no, no.
**Gducharme**: See the little mailboxes on the wall?
**Dmacari**: Yep.
**Gducharme**: If you walk up the stairs there.
**Dmacari**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Click.
**Bclymer**: See where it says more up there?
**Njepson**: Springs.
**Njepson**: That's it.
**Njepson**: Text number, multi person.
**Bclymer**: I'll show you after this how to do it.
**Gducharme**: My drywaller just showed up, so can I.
**Gducharme**: Can I rattle through mine?
**Bclymer**: Just go ahead and go meet with your drywall or we'll continue.
**Gducharme**: I put.
**Gducharme**: I put all my updates in.
**Gducharme**: In.
**Njepson**: Yeah, that was great.
**Bclymer**: Just me with your drywall.
**Bclymer**: You can jump back in when you're done.
**Gducharme**: All right, See you.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Njepson**: So we did glance already with Westfield Collective.
**Njepson**: He really did his updates.
**Mcalcetero**: Got an update.
**Mcalcetero**: Since that happened, though, I just got a call from the city.
**Bclymer**: What'd they say?
**Mcalcetero**: They're reviewing our plans right now.
**Gducharme**: We.
**Mcalcetero**: They'll get us on the schedule for pre con Thursday or Friday.
**Mcalcetero**: As soon as we're done with pre con, we can pretty much schedule to start getting our silt fence up and then pushing dirt.
**Mcalcetero**: He said he'll get us through the LP submission and all that stuff with their pre con.
**Mcalcetero**: The only.
**Mcalcetero**: The only question is Ashton had said something about when we turn into item.
**Mcalcetero**: We have to give them 48 hours to review before we can start, and.
**Bclymer**: So can we not go ahead and turn it into idem?
**Mcalcetero**: I don't have anything to turn into item.
**Bclymer**: What do we have to turn into item?
**Mcalcetero**: I believe our permit from the city.
**Bclymer**: But the city's not going to get.
**Bclymer**: The city's not going to give us a permit after that pre con.
**Bclymer**: We're not going to get the permit.
**Mcalcetero**: Until Ashton's the one who gave.
**Mcalcetero**: Who gave us that information.
**Mcalcetero**: I don't have any.
**Mcalcetero**: I don't have any more information.
**Mcalcetero**: I know that the city just said that we can start pushing dirt as far as they're concerned after the pre con.
**Mcalcetero**: Get us scheduled for that Thursday or Friday this week.
**Bclymer**: So that, I guess.
**Bclymer**: I guess go ahead and, you know, you want to call and figure out, like, what we have to do with idem so that we can get moving there and then go ahead and get all your earthwork and silk fence and all that kind of stuff lined up for Monday?
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Gducharme**: Yep.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Glenn, is.
**Gducharme**: Glenn, is Ashton helping you with your submission for the item permit?
**Gducharme**: He.
**Mcalcetero**: He had mentioned it to us a few weeks ago when he was telling us how the process was going to go with trying to.
**Mcalcetero**: When we were trying to figure out the dates.
**Mcalcetero**: This is, this is over a month ago when he was telling us just kind of the rough timelines.
**Mcalcetero**: Hey, I'm going to submit it to Westfield.
**Mcalcetero**: They're going to give me comments back and forth, back and forth.
**Mcalcetero**: And then at the end, when they approve it, then we have to send to the state and item and you have to give them 48 hours.
**Mcalcetero**: He's on vacation now, so I need to reach out to him and find out.
**Mcalcetero**: But yeah, he, he said he would.
**Gducharme**: Help with, with that.
**Mcalcetero**: I don't know what needs to go to items, but he does.
**Gducharme**: All they'll do, I think, is just send you like, they'll send you your permit and then that's what you have to do to reference all your swips and have it posted on the job site signage.
**Gducharme**: Then you meet with Westfield and you're good to start moving stuff.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Speaker 6**: Blaine, did you go over what we talked about and that you're working on foundations?
**Gducharme**: Yeah, I got a hold.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, I did.
**Mcalcetero**: I.
**Mcalcetero**: I spoke with the company who was on that abatement report and I'm.
**Speaker 6**: Saying for Maria, can you put the PM for that project as Glenn?
**Njepson**: Which one?
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Speaker 6**: Yeah, we did foundations.
**Speaker 6**: Okay.
**Mcalcetero**: She did.
**Njepson**: Oh, yeah, we did.
**Njepson**: Yeah, yeah, we just did it once.
**Njepson**: You were not connected it.
**Bclymer**: You don't need to repeat it if.
**Speaker 6**: You'Ve already gone through it.
**Speaker 6**: That's fine.
**Speaker 6**: I just, Just joined late, so.
**Speaker 6**: Sorry.
**Njepson**: I know.
**Njepson**: Jesse, I mean, come on, come on.
**Gducharme**: I mean, get him, Maria.
**Gducharme**: Get him.
**Njepson**: I mean, you were in a call with me at this, but I saw it.
**Speaker 6**: Oh, I told you to buy a new one, so I just need to get a new phone.
**Bclymer**: He probably forgot.
**Bclymer**: Guys, when you're his age, I mean.
**Dmacari**: Honestly, I want you to get distracted.
**Speaker 6**: By like, candy stores and like soda.
**Dmacari**: Fountain machines and I just don't even know where I'm at.
**Mcalcetero**: Is the Goodwill foundation still an estimating, Jesse?
**Dmacari**: Yes.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: Do we still have a project, A job number for that one?
**Njepson**: That one is empty.
**Bclymer**: That should be the, the date that it was created.
**Bclymer**: So It'll be, you know, 25.
**Njepson**: Yeah, but that was.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: I don't know.
**Njepson**: When I think you see how it.
**Njepson**: I think it was 20.
**Njepson**: It was last week, right?
**Njepson**: Jesse, like, right after the last week, two weeks.
**Dmacari**: Because we've already sent.
**Njepson**: So let's do 2517.
**Njepson**: 2020.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So, Maria, you want to put a.
**Bclymer**: A note for yourself in that job?
**Bclymer**: A task.
**Bclymer**: It doesn't look like we have a folder in OneDrive created, so you want to make sure we do that for which one?
**Njepson**: For Goodwill Foundation.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Do you have one, Jesse?
**Bclymer**: I'm an estimating.
**Mcalcetero**: Sorry.
**Mcalcetero**: I think I moved it to the 20, 25 jobs.
**Mcalcetero**: I didn't.
**Mcalcetero**: That's why I was asking if it was still an estimating.
**Dmacari**: You shouldn't move them until they become a job.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, I didn't know if it was.
**Gducharme**: It's bad juju if you give a job a job number before you have a signed contract.
**Gducharme**: Bad luck.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: So just so you know, so we'll make this really clear, like, nobody should be moving anything from estimating to a live job except for me and Jesse.
**Bclymer**: Unless you're explicitly told to.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So, Maria, that number should be 25.
**Bclymer**: 3 13.
**Bclymer**: So it's the.
**Bclymer**: The year is.
**Njepson**: Yeah, one second.
**Njepson**: Because I'm doing it wrong.
**Njepson**: 25.0.
**Bclymer**: 3.13.
**Njepson**: 13, you say?
**Njepson**: 25 0.
**Njepson**: 3.13.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Njepson**: Got it.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Njepson**: Okay, what's next?
**Njepson**: A.
**Njepson**: You want to go back to yours?
**Gducharme**: I think we're good on the great clips one, which.
**Gducharme**: What else do I have down there?
**Bclymer**: I thought you had Mr.
**Bclymer**: Drywall Guy.
**Gducharme**: I was just letting them in.
**Gducharme**: They're.
**Gducharme**: They're walking through getting measurements now.
**Gducharme**: They don't.
**Gducharme**: I'll close this up here when he's done.
**Gducharme**: He's gonna be there for the next 30 minutes.
**Gducharme**: So, Brandon, did we hear anything on Bella Canvas?
**Bclymer**: No.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: The Will Heritage.
**Gducharme**: What's the word on that?
**Bclymer**: Nothing.
**Bclymer**: I mean, that's.
**Bclymer**: Again, I don't think it's going forward.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: Do you need any help on Monon Yard?
**Bclymer**: Our estimator will be doing it.
**Gducharme**: When's he starting?
**Bclymer**: Tomorrow.
**Njepson**: Tomorrow.
**Dmacari**: That's something.
**Dmacari**: Ken, Since Ken's doing.
**Dmacari**: Ken, are you on here?
**Bclymer**: I am.
**Dmacari**: And I have to defend Jesse because he spent a lot of time with me trying to get me up, get me started.
**Dmacari**: I appreciate that.
**Dmacari**: And hello to everybody on Similar to the Collectives.
**Dmacari**: So that'd be good for you.
**Dmacari**: And Ken told me today he knows a lady here in Tampa, that friend is that manufactures containers into restaurants and whatnot as well.
**Dmacari**: So he's going to reach out to her and get another price, but.
**Bclymer**: Perfect.
**Dmacari**: When you get your computer work again, just look in that folder.
**Dmacari**: You can see they got like three different option layouts and all kinds of stuff they were looking at doing.
**Bclymer**: Start.
**Dmacari**: Getting spicing for that.
**Dmacari**: But that company in Indiana, that is getting us a price that I contacted, they actually make Indiana.
**Dmacari**: So maybe that job would be something they could get a good number on too.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Gducharme**: Ken, let me know if you need help with your computer, okay?
**Gducharme**: Give me a call or something offline.
**Gducharme**: I can help.
**Njepson**: Yeah, we're figuring that out.
**Njepson**: Like.
**Dmacari**: The Geek Squad guy, like stopping him and.
**Dmacari**: And then he figured it out.
**Dmacari**: Didn't have to call Andrew because he.
**Dmacari**: He almost had it done, but it's working.
**Dmacari**: He just.
**Dmacari**: He's gotta set himself up.
**Dmacari**: Should be good.
**Gducharme**: Sounds good.
**Njepson**: Okay, what's next is street white box.
**Njepson**: Which one is that one?
**Gducharme**: Haven't heard anything as far as closing Brandon.
**Gducharme**: Have you followed up with them recently?
**Gducharme**: You want me to.
**Bclymer**: I'll.
**Bclymer**: I'll text him.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: Okay, Next one.
**Gducharme**: Maria Stone, gate orthodontist.
**Gducharme**: This one's gonna be moving here.
**Gducharme**: So I was exchanged texts with Ron.
**Gducharme**: They closed on the property last Friday.
**Gducharme**: They're looking to be in their building by 2027.
**Gducharme**: They haven't picked an architect or a GC or anything.
**Gducharme**: So I'll set up a time for coffee or this week or next week or.
**Gducharme**: He's out right now, he said.
**Gducharme**: But set up a call where he can use us for the design and the build.
**Gducharme**: So, Brandon, I'll get with you and Jesse on schedules.
**Gducharme**: Try and do that.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, Be perfect.
**Bclymer**: Do we know what he wants?
**Gducharme**: Yeah, I mean, I have some programming I did for him.
**Gducharme**: If you go back and look at the file, the old file on like a general idea.
**Gducharme**: He was looking at a two story, but the idea is to have some rentable area to make it.
**Gducharme**: To make it work.
**Gducharme**: But either way, he's building a building.
**Gducharme**: So we just need to put our heads together.
**Gducharme**: I'd like to put together some resumes to send them and some marketing stuff because at the end of the day, you know.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, I was.
**Gducharme**: I know Ron pretty well, but this is a guy that.
**Gducharme**: He built that big monstrosity off of Carmel Drive.
**Gducharme**: Like he's looking to step back from being an orthodontist and step more into doing developments like this.
**Bclymer**: So I guess the thing is, I mean, does he.
**Bclymer**: What are his thoughts as far as.
**Bclymer**: All right, so I just got a text.
**Bclymer**: East street is dead.
**Bclymer**: So you can mark that as lost.
**Bclymer**: I just got a text.
**Bclymer**: He goes, that backed out last minute.
**Gducharme**: Me and the computer guy.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, that's funny.
**Bclymer**: So anyway, so, yeah, Well, I guess so.
**Bclymer**: As far as next steps with Ron, you know what.
**Bclymer**: What is it that you know we can do?
**Bclymer**: Is it a phone call?
**Bclymer**: Is it actually setting up a meeting?
**Bclymer**: Like, what is the best way?
**Gducharme**: I don't know.
**Gducharme**: I'm just gonna call him on my way home and check in with him.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: And tell him I'd like for him to meet us.
**Gducharme**: He knows me, but he'll get even more warm and fuzzies with.
**Gducharme**: I have someone with.
**Gducharme**: With gray hair talking to him.
**Gducharme**: That was a joke.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, we know.
**Gducharme**: I'm starting to get gray.
**Gducharme**: So.
**Bclymer**: You give me some.
**Bclymer**: That's for sure.
**Gducharme**: What did you say, Jesse?
**Speaker 6**: Just for men.
**Speaker 6**: Aj, you can hide it for years.
**Gducharme**: No, I'm gonna.
**Gducharme**: I'm gonna go get Touch of Gray on purpose so people don't think I'm 12.
**Speaker 6**: But you wouldn't be able to talk.
**Dmacari**: AJ, I'm going to jump in at this point and first day, defend myself and, And.
**Dmacari**: And also let you know that if you need any help with the.
**Dmacari**: With the gray or with the.
**Dmacari**: With the.
**Dmacari**: With the cosmetic for that, let me know.
**Bclymer**: What do you mean?
**Bclymer**: You need to give them all three of your hairs?
**Bclymer**: Come on.
**Dmacari**: Okay, I'm muted now.
**Bclymer**: All right, well, yeah, so reach out to.
**Bclymer**: To Ron, AJ today and.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And then let's call him, see where that goes.
**Bclymer**: Try to set up a meeting.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, I have the side information already.
**Gducharme**: I've already taken drone footage of it, so I know where all the utilities are.
**Gducharme**: I'd like to wow them somehow.
**Gducharme**: It's not going to be.
**Gducharme**: It's not going to be more than a two and a half million dollar job, but it's a.
**Gducharme**: A cool ground up in a blown up area over there in Whitestown.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Njepson**: Okay, what's next?
**Bclymer**: So let's see here.
**Gducharme**: Uniqlo.
**Njepson**: Yeah, but Uniqlo isn't yours, right?
**Njepson**: Oh, it's Brandon's.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: It's not mine.
**Gducharme**: I'm just.
**Gducharme**: He's muted on a call so he can update that.
**Gducharme**: I think they were working on that earlier.
**Speaker 6**: Is updating.
**Speaker 6**: I just got to look at it.
**Speaker 6**: The inclusions to match our last proposal because they wanted us to get our number down.
**Speaker 6**: We cut a bunch of stuff out, so.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Speaker 6**: I just got to review that and get that back to Brandon so we can send it to them.
**Gducharme**: Sweet.
**Speaker 6**: They got.
**Speaker 6**: We've requested the takeoff.
**Speaker 6**: Oh, Alex made some calls so we can get all the materials ordered.
**Speaker 6**: So we're just getting basically a takeoff to secure the pipe and heads and all that.
**Speaker 6**: They don't seem to think anything's going to go up after that last initial jump, so.
**Speaker 6**: Should be good on materials.
**Speaker 6**: We need to set up a meeting to create a schedule with the owner and their exotech folks.
**Speaker 6**: That needs to happen.
**Speaker 6**: Permit.
**Speaker 6**: Permit application.
**Speaker 6**: I sent it to them to confirm the owner and architect info.
**Speaker 6**: Once I send that back, we'll get that submitted to the city.
**Speaker 6**: The city has also you can put on there.
**Speaker 6**: They're updating their drawings.
**Speaker 6**: I asked them to make sure they put all of our ve specifically for the electrical on the drawing so we don't have issues with inspections.
**Speaker 6**: I think that's about it for Unique Glow.
**Gducharme**: Restaurant Build out.
**Gducharme**: Maria, we're done.
**Gducharme**: We're done with.
**Gducharme**: I just need to bill for it.

**Gducharme**: I'll have him do that.
**Njepson**: Sounds good.
**Njepson**: Next.

**Bclymer**: Who's gonna be the PM on that.
**Speaker 6**: Tremont?
**Speaker 6**: Nick might be able to, because we're almost done with art.
**Gducharme**: Oh, okay.
**Bclymer**: I mean, it's small.
**Bclymer**: There's not much to it.
**Bclymer**: And then we'll have the estimator of, you know, get pricing.

**Bclymer**: Just.
**Bclymer**: You'll take me off as the owner and make him.

**Gducharme**: We have a meeting scheduled for the seventh to review that with the owner so I need to get them a contract.
**Gducharme**: They haven't said how they want to do that.
**Njepson**: Okay, so waiting on that.

**Dmacari**: Oh yeah, that's.
**Speaker 6**: We just got to go back.
**Speaker 6**: The welding's done.

**Speaker 6**: Oh yeah, that's Nick Nicky on there.

**Bclymer**: Okay so we'll be done in final build win.
**Ataylor**: Yeah we, we build.
**Bclymer**: You're muted.
**Ataylor**: I had a 100% for the billing.
**Bclymer**: When did you.
**Bclymer**: For last month.

**Bclymer**: Gotcha.
**Dmacari**: You're gonna bill 100%.
**Dmacari**: What?
**Dmacari**: I'm not done till April, Nick.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, I know at the time we, we were going to be done but things switched up this week.
**Ataylor**: So I guess I, I can go through through and revise that.
**Bclymer**: I mean how much, how much is going to be left?
**Ataylor**: Very, very little.
**Bclymer**: So just build 98% and then that way we get paid and they can't be like, oh you're not done yet.
**Bclymer**: Like that way they have to release payment.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Njepson**: As far as on Lucy.
**Njepson**: So that's it from Nick.
**Njepson**: We have that cormark ga exotech.
**Njepson**: This is Jesse, this is yours, Brandon.
**Njepson**: Jesse.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So yep, you can mark the go back to finish as done.
**Bclymer**: So the only thing is, so we, we might have a.
**Bclymer**: I sent them a change order for cleaning the racking.
**Bclymer**: Waiting to see if they want us to do that.
**Bclymer**: And then I just need to create a change order for the added valve and stuff.
**Bclymer**: So you can put a tank ask.
**Speaker 6**: We can go back to this fire.
**Speaker 6**: There's a couple things Nick, like we had, we had some work in there to rework some ceiling that they say we don't need to do now.
**Speaker 6**: So I don't want to make them.
**Speaker 6**: We just need to make sure we got like that and they can decide if they want us to do something else.
**Speaker 6**: And then those items that aren't complete yet, the painting and basically cleaning up.
**Speaker 6**: So it is minor, but I don't want to get them sideways before we possibly do another big thing with them.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Njepson**: Okay, sounds good.
**Njepson**: So revised printing, right?
**Njepson**: Revised.

**Njepson**: That we need to do for this one?
**Ataylor**: We're waiting on the permit for that.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Speaker 6**: Was there any items for us?
**Speaker 6**: Checking on the fence delivery and all those things.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, I know you.
**Ataylor**: You reached out to the fence guy on Thursday.
**Ataylor**: I don't think he responded.
**Ataylor**: So I can follow up with him.
**Dmacari**: He did.
**Speaker 6**: I got a hold of him later and he confirmed the operators and the gates are all ordered.
**Speaker 6**: You just didn't know exactly when they would get there.
**Speaker 6**: Okay, so just follow up with them and get those dates.
**Njepson**: Diva Consulting Building.
**Njepson**: This is Brandon's, I think.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, those subcontracting tropos are all done.
**Bclymer**: And then.
**Bclymer**: So we just need a start date's done.
**Bclymer**: Issue with layout.
**Bclymer**: So the issue with layout solved.
**Bclymer**: You know the biggest thing is we need to do.
**Bclymer**: You need to do a change order for.
**Bclymer**: Need to do a change order for basically additional work.
**Bclymer**: So additional material work.
**Bclymer**: So I just need to figure that out.
**Njepson**: Okay, so I'm going to leave you here as a comment.
**Njepson**: Okay, perfect.
**Njepson**: What's next?
**Njepson**: So we had Siva and then we have Goodwill Bloomington.
**Ataylor**: We're also waiting on the permit for that project.
**Speaker 6**: You could.
**Speaker 6**: Can you update the status on that though, in there?
**Njepson**: Which one?
**Njepson**: Bloomington Permit approval is still in progress here.
**Speaker 6**: Well, but they sent us their comments.
**Speaker 6**: Nick was able to respond with the new drawings and they've agreed to start reviewing them while we're waiting on the easement.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Njepson**: Aspire Newport, Richie.
**Ataylor**: Nick Newport, Richie.
**Ataylor**: We should be done in a week or two.
**Njepson**: No comments on something or changes on.
**Njepson**: For example, price for the CAT files is still not starting.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, we did reach out to the architect last week, but he didn't send a proposal, so need to follow up with him.
**Njepson**: So nicked to follow up.
**Njepson**: Okay, Nick Jackson to follow up.
**Njepson**: And then we have Memphis Cold Storage.
**Njepson**: This is aj.
**Njepson**: I think we lost him.
**Bclymer**: Aj, you there?

**Bclymer**: Oh, he's just texting me now.
**Gducharme**: Can you hear me?
**Njepson**: Yeah, now we can.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: No, you haven't lost me.
**Gducharme**: I was just locking up.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, so I'm still waiting on marching orders.
**Gducharme**: I know, Jesse.
**Gducharme**: Brandon and I are working through getting our license done there.
**Gducharme**: Spoke with Brandon earlier.
**Gducharme**: I'm going to go ahead and start the process of submitting for a permit just to see what that takes.
**Gducharme**: So I'll make an Excel account here tomorrow and see what all needs to happen there.
**Gducharme**: Other than that, I got a couple things to clean up.
**Gducharme**: So I'm waiting on a letter from the structural engineer stating that our conduits are fine to rest on the joist today and tomorrow.
**Gducharme**: Mid south is there confirming that they aren't resting.

**Gducharme**: So I have a guy going.
**Gducharme**: Going out there tomorrow to price that up.
**Gducharme**: That's all I got.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Njepson**: And thank you for updating it.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Speaker 6**: Aj, did you talk to the.
**Speaker 6**: That ceiling guy again today?
**Gducharme**: I did.
**Gducharme**: I.
**Gducharme**: I emailed with him.
**Gducharme**: Now, I didn't put any email about the other stuff, but I.
**Gducharme**: I did, yes, I did chat with him a little bit.
**Gducharme**: Jesse, we could talk about it later.
**Speaker 6**: Okay.
**Speaker 6**: He's just late.
**Gducharme**: Just late.
**Gducharme**: I just thought.
**Gducharme**: I figured we'd talk about any licensing stuff.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: Later.
**Njepson**: Goodwill bar.
**Gducharme**: Because the government is listening.
**Ataylor**: The closeout documents.
**Ataylor**: I'm still working on that.
**Njepson**: Okay, so is it in progress or not started?
**Ataylor**: Not.
**Ataylor**: Not started.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Njepson**: Which one is next?
**Njepson**: Createscape.
**Njepson**: That's uij, I think.
**Gducharme**: Yep.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Gducharme**: Crates.
**Gducharme**: Good.
**Gducharme**: So we got all of our material getting delivered this week.
**Gducharme**: I got Chad helping me knock it out.
**Gducharme**: And we'll have guys on site doing all the pud corrections next week.
**Gducharme**: Landscaping got done.
**Gducharme**: Let's see.
**Gducharme**: The hood got done, so striping got done.
**Gducharme**: It's just getting these last couple punch list items done here in the next four.
**Gducharme**: Four weeks.
**Gducharme**: And then that project will be finally wrapped up.
**Njepson**: Awesome.
**Gducharme**: I gotta build.
**Gducharme**: I gotta build for the hood.
**Gducharme**: That.
**Gducharme**: That's the only thing I have to bill for for that project.
**Gducharme**: I'll make sure I get that out.
**Njepson**: What about.
**Njepson**: Did you.
**Njepson**: Are we done with this one?
**Njepson**: A chat to Proker and update.
**Njepson**: Punch list.
**Njepson**: Is this done?
**Gducharme**: I have not done that.
**Gducharme**: Nope.
**Njepson**: Okay, so that's still not started.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Njepson**: We have to do that.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Njepson**: Alta Dallas.
**Njepson**: That's aj.
**Gducharme**: Yep.
**Gducharme**: I got Cannon in town this week.
**Gducharme**: He's helping.
**Gducharme**: Helping coordinate with the guys.
**Gducharme**: We got row one done and water on the pipes.
**Gducharme**: We'll have row two done today.
**Gducharme**: Let's see here.
**Gducharme**: I got my billing done.
**Gducharme**: Just waiting for the invoice from accounting and.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, we're all good there.
**Gducharme**: I.
**Gducharme**: I do.
**Gducharme**: They did ask for another welding price and I just.
**Gducharme**: I.
**Gducharme**: I can't find a guy to do it.
**Gducharme**: So it's something that I got to work on.
**Gducharme**: I've already got them two prices, so I'm half tempted with the approval of Brandon to make up a number.
**Gducharme**: But we could talk about that tomorrow.
**Njepson**: Okay, Next one.
**Njepson**: We have Tennessee license, but that's Jesse.
**Njepson**: How are we doing on that?
**Njepson**: All good?
**Speaker 6**: Yeah.
**Speaker 6**: I think we're just waiting for the audit and then.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Speaker 6**: What's the other forms got to go?
**Speaker 6**: I just need to sign once we added all the documents to it.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Njepson**: Office supplies.
**Njepson**: Not sure.
**Njepson**: What is that?
**Njepson**: I don't know if we.
**Njepson**: You added on purpose this year or something.
**Njepson**: Office supplies.
**Gducharme**: I think, Maria, I think what happens is like when people.
**Gducharme**: Because that happened with the West Lane job, when people are coding their credit cards, it creates a job.
**Gducharme**: Because I noticed it did that for the West Lane Church, for me.
**Gducharme**: Because West Lane Church has been closed out.
**Gducharme**: They wanted us to come hang a TV and move some electrical.
**Gducharme**: So we had to go do that for them.
**Gducharme**: And I had a charge on my credit card and it created that job in there.
**Gducharme**: So I would look into it.
**Gducharme**: I'm assuming that's what the office supplies is from.
**Njepson**: Probably.
**Njepson**: Okay, if you can check that, please.
**Njepson**: And then we have the last one.
**Njepson**: 3150 W.
**Njepson**: This is who, Maurice street estimate.
**Njepson**: A.J.
**Njepson**: that's you.
**Gducharme**: Yes.
**Gducharme**: Yep.
**Gducharme**: So I sent that pricing out.
**Gducharme**: Is actually just met with a couple of the guys.
**Gducharme**: I have to get a proposal to them by the end of the week.
**Njepson**: So also by the end of the week.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Speaker 6**: Has everyone caught up on their expenses?
**Speaker 6**: Coding receipts?
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Gducharme**: Yes.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Njepson**: Okay, perfect.
**Njepson**: What else, guys?
**Njepson**: Something else you think we need to add before we wrap up?
