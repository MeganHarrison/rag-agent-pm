**Fnjie**: That's overdue.
**Speaker 5**: Oh, that's overdue.
**Speaker 5**: No, we don't have anything in the 60 to 90 day range.
**Speaker 5**: Accounts payable.

**Speaker 5**: So 31 to 60.
**Speaker 5**: We have.
**Speaker 5**: We have 25,000.
**Speaker 5**: It's not a lot.
**Speaker 5**: Most of it is showing in the current section.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 5**: Yeah, a lot of the.
**Speaker 5**: A lot of the invoices are in the current.
**Speaker 5**: Current section.
**Jdawson**: And is that.
**Jdawson**: Is part of that.
**Jdawson**: You know, we requested a check for this pay an invoice on Avon, but they don't accept checks.
**Jdawson**: Was that part of that total.
**Speaker 5**: Avon?
**Jmendez**: Yeah, I have already posted some of that invoices and have not processed any checks yet.
**Fnjie**: No, what he's asking is, is that 11 or whatever, however many thousand that was for.
**Fnjie**: For the doc seals, is that included in that 25,000 or what's included in the 25,000?
**Speaker 5**: So I'll tell you what's 25,000 includes 2700 for CNC Foundation, 10,000 for Homestead Joint Reinforcement, an indie rooftop about 1100. Who is the vendor?
**Jdawson**: Well, it wouldn't be there if there's only 25,000 do.
**Jdawson**: They wouldn't be in it because it was like 16 thumb something.
**Speaker 5**: Who's the vendor?
**Speaker 5**: Who is it for?
**Jdawson**: I don't know offhand.
**Jdawson**: I'd have to look at the.
**Speaker 5**: Is it the one Keva emailed about?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, no, it was the one that.
**Jdawson**: Yes, it was Kevin's email.
**Speaker 5**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So I responded.
**Jdawson**: We'll just have to pay it with the card.
**Jdawson**: But.
**Accounting**: Can.
**Speaker 5**: Can we do an ach.
**Fnjie**: No.
**Speaker 5**: Oh, no, we can't.
**Speaker 5**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: So then are they going to charge us a fee for the credit card, Jesse?
**Jdawson**: I don't think they did last time.
**Jdawson**: I can find out.
**Jmendez**: Is that the Rose Paving LLC.
**Jmendez**: That is for Radial Avon?
**Jmendez**: 16,000.
**Jdawson**: And the last payment we made to him on the card was that.
**Jdawson**: I think that charge was exactly the amount on there.
**Jdawson**: On that invoice.
**Jmendez**: The add that pro door.
**Jmendez**: The one.
**Speaker 5**: Yeah, the 16,000 is for pro Door.
**Speaker 5**: That's the one Jesse is talking about.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I'll find out.
**Jdawson**: I'm gonna have to call them tomorrow when they make payment.
**Jdawson**: But.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I mean, stuff shows up.
**Jdawson**: I don't know if we got time to do anything else anyways.
**Fnjie**: Okay, well, I mean, yeah, it's supposed to show up.
**Speaker 5**: Yeah.
**Speaker 5**: Fritzi, I don't see that invoice in acumatica.
**Speaker 5**: Has it been processed for the professional garage door?
**Jmendez**: I asked Keba to send an invoice since it's a sales order.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: But we canceled it because they said they don't accept checks, so.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: For now, it's just.
**Jdawson**: It's.
**Jdawson**: You guys don't have to worry about it.
**Jdawson**: I was just asking if that was part of the amount that's due currently.
**Jdawson**: So that's not the case.
**Jdawson**: So it just makes up some other things that you mentioned there.
**Jdawson**: So then just when it comes to accounts receivable, has anything been come in since last week?
**Jdawson**: I know the Aspire guys told me they were going to.
**Jdawson**: They were paying 2 of the invoice that were past due.
**Jmendez**: There are amount that has been, but it's not cleared yet.
**Fnjie**: The only payments we've got, Jesse, is we got $14,000 payment, which I think was for that Coastal Cantina at Crate.
**Jmendez**: We also have for applied engineering 141.290.63.
**Fnjie**: And Mike called me and we should get paid tomorrow.
**Fnjie**: He said.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 5**: It'S Mike with Aspire.
**Fnjie**: Who's Mike with Westfield Collective.
**Speaker 5**: Westfield Collective.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 5**: There's.
**Speaker 5**: There's still a $9,000 over 60 days for Aspire.
**Speaker 5**: Aspire Oak Tree.
**Speaker 5**: Yeah, yeah, Daytona.
**Jdawson**: So that they paid some of the other ones or you're saying no, we.
**Fnjie**: Got one payment from them for like 60 something.
**Jmendez**: Yeah.
**Jmendez**: I think we also have Goodwill.
**Jmendez**: They usually paid us on time.
**Jmendez**: And it.
**Jmendez**: This is also approved in FUPA.
**Jmendez**: We have 900 from Goodwill.
**Speaker 5**: And then I Beach, I Beach Holden Partners, that's Westfield.
**Speaker 5**: Okay.
**Speaker 5**: And then.
**Fnjie**: Vori's Road, that's Aspire.
**Speaker 5**: Oh, that's aspire too.
**Speaker 5**: Okay.
**Speaker 5**: 4927.
**Speaker 5**: They have about 90,000 you over 31 days.
**Jdawson**: You said that.
**Fnjie**: Yeah.
**Speaker 5**: I'm gonna send this to you, Jesse.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Accounting**: So quarterly closing updates, issues or delays that we have, insurance updates or payments, something missing.
**Fnjie**: We need to get that damn workers comp figured out.
**Accounting**: Yes, yes.
**Accounting**: Lisa already sent that.
**Accounting**: Other than that, Keva asked this morning for the COI of Uniqlo.
**Fnjie**: Yeah, that one that you sent wasn't the correct one.
**Jdawson**: I asked him to be more clear.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: To be clear is they had asked, hey, can you send us what your current coverages are so we can see what the difference is?
**Jdawson**: That's the only.
**Jdawson**: He should have just stated that though, in the email.
**Jdawson**: That was the reason he attached that it wasn't the one to upgrade.
**Jdawson**: It's the one that we sent him previously when this whole thing started.
**Jdawson**: So has that company actually given us a new certificate of insurance for it or.
**Jdawson**: We're waiting until they approve the change order.
**Fnjie**: Well, we don't have it yet because we've got to finish like we paid part of it.
**Fnjie**: We got to finish paying the rest of it.
**Fnjie**: So I'm not going to finish paying it until Uniqo says it's a change order.
**Fnjie**: Because I mean, that's what we agreed on.
**Fnjie**: That's the contract.
**Fnjie**: And like I told Keba, I said if they balk, we're walking like, we'll pull off.
**Fnjie**: I'll hit him with a delay.
**Fnjie**: Because I mean, the contract says black and white.
**Fnjie**: Like here's a.
**Fnjie**: You agreed, here's the backup.
**Fnjie**: Any delay you cause right now is on them.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Because I can see, I'm like, you know, I don't know where that came from on their end, but they're so hard pressed for money now, if they say, oh, don't worry about it, your insurance is fine, that would be bullshit.
**Fnjie**: Absolutely.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Accounting**: Accounts payable and receivables, reviewing of pending payments.
**Accounting**: You already mentioned that.
**Accounting**: Vendor issues, already mentioned that.
**Accounting**: Client billing updates, something that we need to Update for clients.
**Speaker 5**: Client billions go out once a month, right?
**Fnjie**: Correct.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So Fatima, like all the guys, I've told them all they have to approve all sub buildings by the 25th.
**Jdawson**: And where I used to work, accounting would lock down.
**Jdawson**: You know, I don't know, it's a little different and I don't know if we can do that in job planner, but they would close sub billings and not allow subs to bill after that date that we pick is the 25th.
**Jdawson**: It protects us from them billing afterwards.
**Jdawson**: But you know, then next week like by the first, all the guys need to have their billings done and I need to review them and make sure we build enough on each job.
**Jdawson**: And then we'll make sure you if you would help me out, you know, reminding the guys billings due they need to send you a copy of it and myself as well, even before we finally approve it just so you can help me.
**Jdawson**: Like, hey, I haven't seen something for this job or this job yet.
**Fnjie**: Well, they need to send a summary that says, you know, here's what this we're being billed, here's what we're billing.
**Fnjie**: So like it can clearly be seen like, hey, we're being billed 120, we're billing 160.
**Speaker 5**: Okay.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And sometimes that's not, you know, obviously if we get ahead on the billings towards the end of the job, we'll be building less than we get billed.
**Jdawson**: But.
**Fnjie**: Right.
**Speaker 5**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: For the most part, like the total amount, you know, that's what we track on the PSR each month is how much have we been billed plus how much have we spent on RGCs versus like what is their owner billing total this month.
**Jdawson**: And so we just want to make sure those numbers are good in our favor.
**Speaker 5**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And so that's the one thing like you know, I don't know how close are we are to and if I'm holding up some of the charges getting approved.
**Jdawson**: But are we close to having actual job cost like hitting it close a week or two off on that?
**Fnjie**: I mean the credit cards just got the last payment cycle just closed.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Fnjie**: That was coded.
**Speaker 5**: Yeah.
**Speaker 5**: And I think most of them, I.
**Fnjie**: Think they're due Friday.
**Speaker 5**: Yeah, they've been really good with coding.
**Speaker 5**: I think we just need the final approvals to close out June.
**Speaker 5**: And once we close out June and import those, all your job costs.
**Speaker 5**: Job cost through June will be good to go.
**Speaker 5**: Think the only hold up has has been importing the credit cards into acumatica.
**Speaker 5**: We've had everything done through me.
**Jdawson**: So like People's time, everything is up within two weeks.
**Jdawson**: Credit card charges and people's labor costs.
**Jdawson**: Like our own team.
**Speaker 5**: Jose and Fritzi, where are we with the payroll?
**Speaker 5**: How far have we we gotten with the payroll allocation?
**Bclymer**: Okay, we are working on coding the payroll as of July 18 and according.
**Bclymer**: According to timesheet.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, but I still working on that.
**Speaker 5**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Speaker 5**: So for payroll, we are through.
**Speaker 5**: We are current all the way up to July.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Accounting**: Yes.
**Accounting**: And then from my side on payroll, everything good.
**Accounting**: So we're still waiting on this Charles, I think it's his name, Jess, to confirm if he wants to join a later on Friday so we can add them to the system.
**Accounting**: And payroll as well.
**Accounting**: Is Charles or Charlie?
**Jdawson**: I believe it's Charlie.
**Accounting**: Okay, so we'll wait for him.
**Accounting**: Okay, we'll wait for him.
**Accounting**: But other than that, on payroll is good.
**Accounting**: Everything is updated.
**Accounting**: We just need to find out what happened with the credit cards for Kevin and Alec.
**Accounting**: Jesse already got his in Indiana.
**Accounting**: I already asked Glenn to check if they already received the other credit cards for Alec and Jesse.
**Accounting**: Alec and Kevin, so she can receive those.
**Jdawson**: Did it get lost?
**Accounting**: So apparently.
**Accounting**: So we send it via mail and got lost.
**Accounting**: And again, we just already required a new one.
**Accounting**: So the one that he was sending the mail, it won't work regardless because we.
**Accounting**: He has a new number, a new PIN and everything, so.
**Accounting**: And Capital One already sent those to the Indianapolis office, so we're just waiting to have it.
**Accounting**: And then we're just going to FedEx to make sure we have a tracking.
**Jdawson**: Number on those after you get Alex.
**Jdawson**: And you'll send them both.
**Accounting**: So Alec in just Keva.
**Accounting**: Because Jesse already has his.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I'm just saying we're gonna.
**Jdawson**: So we're gonna wait until we get them both and then send them.
**Accounting**: Oh, yes, yes.
**Jdawson**: Here or Brandon's gonna be here next week too.
**Accounting**: I don't know if they're there.
**Accounting**: He can bring them with him.
**Jdawson**: The credit cards, he'll lose them though, so don't.
**Accounting**: I mean, we'll just mail them or spend them.
**Accounting**: I mean he can just spend money.
**Fnjie**: So you know, it's all goes to the same thing, so that really doesn't matter.
**Accounting**: Okay, we'll make sure.
**Accounting**: I'll just ask Glenn just to confirm if we got him today.
**Accounting**: Just in any way.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Accounting**: Akumatica pending transactions in Akumatica issues delays.
**Speaker 5**: Last week we had reached out to job planner again about Glenn's cost.
**Speaker 5**: And I'm not sure if everybody else is having the same issues or he's the only One catching them.
**Speaker 5**: Jesse, what do you think?
**Speaker 5**: Because I can tell he looks at his budget pretty closely, but he's the only one I hear from regarding stuff hidden the wrong codes in Job Planner.
**Speaker 5**: Do you think everybody else is having issues?
**Jdawson**: I don't know.
**Jdawson**: Relabel your reports, submittal log, and he'll never look at it again.
**Fnjie**: We'll have to double check the PSRs here in the next five days and see if it's happening.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 5**: Okay.
**Speaker 5**: All right.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Accounting**: Go, Fatima.
**Speaker 5**: No, I. I was going to say we've reached out to I Medica about that.
**Speaker 5**: They previously responded and said it was fixed, but, you know, clearly not.
**Jdawson**: So what was his problem?
**Jdawson**: Like, some charges were, it, it was.
**Speaker 5**: It was a direct cost.
**Speaker 5**: So it wasn't showing up in the direct cost section of his budget, but it was in the actual.
**Speaker 5**: So it was showing him that he still had money left on there, but in reality he didn't because that invoice did hit.
**Fnjie**: So as we, you know, are refining this and everything.
**Fnjie**: So we should have, I mean, we have these titles, but we should have minutes, right?
**Fnjie**: And so like, for instance, when we look at pending issues, right, I should be in here in accounting, okay.
**Fnjie**: And I should be looking at.
**Jdawson**: You.
**Fnjie**: Know, like, where are we tracking these issues?
**Fnjie**: Right?
**Fnjie**: You know, so if I'm in here, you know, I see the, I see the calendar, I see accounting tracking, but where, where are we tracking these issues at?
**Fnjie**: So we can say here's the issue, date opened, current status, you know, who's, who's ball in court, right?
**Fnjie**: Who's.
**Fnjie**: Who owns this and who is tracking this down.
**Fnjie**: Like, there should never be any issue in the company that is just said, like it should always be somebody's responsibility.
**Fnjie**: Somebody is championing that.
**Fnjie**: Somebody is chasing that down to get it complete.
**Fnjie**: Because if more than one person has responsibility, that means nobody has responsibility because everybody else is think that somebody else is doing it.
**Fnjie**: So every single issue that we have should have an owner, and they are the ones chasing that down.
**Fnjie**: They're the ones ultimately responsible for getting it taken care of.
**Accounting**: So if you go to the accounting tracking, I know Jose already assigned some of the issues to him and he already said the status has completed and he explained the, you know, the problem and then what's going on also.
**Accounting**: Yeah, so I think that's the tracking thing that you guys.
**Accounting**: I mean, let me know if there's something else you need in terms of properties or anything.
**Accounting**: But this is a good start for the tracking issues.
**Accounting**: So it's there in the accounting Tracking just to make sure we're using it.
**Accounting**: I know who's already set up some for.
**Accounting**: This is on May, right?
**Speaker 5**: Yeah, yeah, I'll add some of the pending stuff right now.
**Accounting**: So we can add them there.
**Accounting**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: And then assign them to you guys so we can see that if it's complete, if it's in progress, pending, all that stuff.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Are you talking more of the agenda here too, Brandon?
**Jdawson**: Just so it's labeled on there or that.
**Fnjie**: Right.
**Jdawson**: The notion.
**Fnjie**: Well, I mean, you can, you can have it as a section.
**Fnjie**: Right.
**Fnjie**: You know, but then it should, you know, then we should be able to easily see like, okay, here's our, you know, here's the things that, that we have issues on.
**Fnjie**: Right.
**Fnjie**: You know, so like I'm looking in here like, you know, failed invoice, Mid South Electrical cold storage.
**Fnjie**: AJ sent email to aj.
**Fnjie**: That is not.
**Fnjie**: That is.
**Fnjie**: That is.
**Fnjie**: I never, ever, ever want to see something like that ever again.
**Fnjie**: That is the laziest thing to ever do.
**Fnjie**: Like the status, the assigned person should be one of.
**Fnjie**: If this is going to be an accounting, it should be somebody in this meeting who's owning it and, you know, taking care of it.
**Fnjie**: Like sending an email.
**Fnjie**: I have 6,000 unread emails.
**Fnjie**: Everybody in here gets too many emails.
**Fnjie**: Like, to worry about something like that.
**Fnjie**: No, you've got to stay on top of it, track it, fix it, you know, and you, you escalate it.
**Fnjie**: If you bug, you know, if this is something where you have to have a project managers input and you keep asking them day after day after day and you're not getting it, then you bring it up, you know, to, to Jesse, you know, hey, can you please help me on this?
**Fnjie**: I need this information from this person and they're not giving it to me, you know, but don't just say I sent an email like that's.
**Fnjie**: Everybody understand that.
**Fnjie**: Like that does nothing.
**Fnjie**: Like that's, that's like we get paid off results.
**Fnjie**: Like you can run all day on a treadmill and you're not going anywhere.
**Fnjie**: Okay?
**Fnjie**: That's what this is.
**Fnjie**: This is just running on a treadmill, not doing anything.
**Fnjie**: So please update this with all the things, okay?
**Fnjie**: Like Jose Maria, make sure that this gets done.
**Fnjie**: One of you two needs to champion this, right?
**Fnjie**: And make sure that all these things are assigned to the correct people.
**Fnjie**: And we know exactly what it is and we're tracking it and it's actually getting done, okay.
**Fnjie**: Like every week, right?
**Fnjie**: So like next week we can look at this and say, here are the you know, existing pending issues and new issues and it should go.
**Fnjie**: It should be changing and going down you.
**Accounting**: Sounds good.
**Accounting**: So I'll have them ready for the next week.
**Accounting**: Yes, Jose.
**Bclymer**: I don't know.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, that's good.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Accounting**: And then Fatima, you said you're going to add some as well, right?
**Accounting**: To those tracking.
**Accounting**: So we can have.
**Accounting**: Okay, yeah.
**Accounting**: And then if you guys need also like if e.g.
**Accounting**: aJ is not replying or anything, also let me know so I can call them right away, let them know that this needs to be done instead of waiting for them.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: And you guys, Fritzy and Jose, like you guys are on the same team as them.
**Fnjie**: Like there's no reason you can't, you know, give them a teens call, you know, and just be like, hey, you know, can you please help me here?
**Fnjie**: Can you give me this answer?
**Fnjie**: Like you know it.
**Fnjie**: There's no reason you can't develop a relationship with other people in the company.
**Accounting**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Accounting**: So credit card transactions in Notion calendar timesheets.
**Accounting**: I saw something related to timesheets, Richie.
**Accounting**: Was it in the accounting team or.
**Jmendez**: I think that is the one that we are providing every payroll.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Accounting**: Okay, sounds good.
**Accounting**: Everything good with credit card transactions calendar.
**Accounting**: So you already updated some of the things that you guys sent.
**Accounting**: Don't forget that we also have the Outlook calendar for you guys.
**Accounting**: You are.
**Accounting**: You can also add stuff for you too.
**Accounting**: So if you want to use it for you, you know like to.
**Accounting**: And set the reminders to everybody.
**Accounting**: That's good.
**Accounting**: I'm adding the reminders that you sent me, Fatima and everything.
**Accounting**: But if there's anything else need to be asked, please feel free to do that or let me know.
**Accounting**: So that's good.
**Jdawson**: Did we get the.
**Jdawson**: Brandon, I don't know if that was the settings you were going to do.
**Jdawson**: So when I have to go in and approve all these guys credit card transaction, it's only the ones I need to touch because I started thinking I had to change them all to something else.
**Jdawson**: And hopefully I didn't change the status of some that weren't ready to be changed yet.
**Fnjie**: Yeah.
**Fnjie**: So I'm looking in here and there's only 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 of them that need to be coded.
**Jdawson**: And it.
**Fnjie**: I mean you should have the same setting when you.
**Fnjie**: When you click on leadership and you go down to credit card transactions to approve.
**Fnjie**: You know, I'll show you.
**Fnjie**: It should look like this.
**Fnjie**: So see here where it says coded.
**Fnjie**: You want to make sure you click on coded not approved.
**Fnjie**: Approved will Take you to everything you want to click on Coded.
**Jdawson**: I gotcha.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Those are the ones.
**Fnjie**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that's the only ones that show up then.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 5**: I see some under imported that are already coded, so I wonder if those were accidentally changed if you go to imported.
**Speaker 5**: This.
**Speaker 5**: These are all coded.
**Bclymer**: I think that there are coded coding.
**Bclymer**: Sorry, but there's still waiting for project, I think.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, some of them doesn't have a project yet, but yeah, imported.
**Bclymer**: So we need the help.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, we need the help on signing the project for Brandon.
**Speaker 5**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: Yeah, imported.
**Fnjie**: Imported just means they're not coded yet, Fatima.
**Fnjie**: So that's.
**Fnjie**: Yeah.
**Speaker 5**: Okay.
**Speaker 5**: Yeah, yeah, I. I saw the Costco that threw me off.
**Speaker 5**: I didn't scroll over to see the project.
**Speaker 5**: So the Costcos are there, but no projects.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: Right.
**Fnjie**: Yeah, I'm looking at it now.
**Fnjie**: I'll get.
**Fnjie**: I'll get them caught up through.
**Speaker 5**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: I just, I need to get all my June ones, it looks like.
