**Bclymer**: Yeah, sure.
**Gducharme**: Can't hurt.
**Ataylor**: Don't hold me to remembering every.
**Ataylor**: Every week, but I'll do my best.
**Gducharme**: I can send you a reminder email to send a reminder email if you want.
**Ataylor**: I suppose I could put it in the calendar.
**Jdawson**: Hi, guys.
**Ataylor**: Hi, Maria.
**Jdawson**: Apologies, we were just having another meeting with Jesse D. So anyway, one second.
**Jdawson**: Let me go and find the user Notion page.
**Jdawson**: Where is notion?
**Jdawson**: Okay, guys, let's go through this little group.
**Jdawson**: This is projects.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Share.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: AJ Alter Dallas.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So we kind of dodged a bullet.
**Bclymer**: Was able to get our.
**Bclymer**: Our permit.
**Bclymer**: Basically able to get a TCO for it.
**Bclymer**: And they.
**Bclymer**: As far as I know, no news is good news.
**Bclymer**: We got everything done as far as fire alarm tie in, our electrical and sprinkler.
**Bclymer**: I'm just waiting for this fire alarm permit to come through and we'll close out the.
**Bclymer**: The change or the.
**Bclymer**: The certificate of occupancy, but other than that, that job's pretty much done.
**Ataylor**: Hey, A.J.
**Bclymer**: Yeah?
**Ataylor**: What's the note on the bottom that says you need to get a price from Vargo?
**Bclymer**: Oh, I need to get a price to Vargo.
**Bclymer**: Sorry, I was like.
**Bclymer**: Well, I work for.
**Bclymer**: I know you're good.
**Bclymer**: No, no, I work for one.
**Bclymer**: They want us to do some more fire alarm tie in, but as far as ours, our main.
**Bclymer**: Our main scope is we're done.
**Bclymer**: So these are all going to be ads after the fact, and they haven't sent me the information I need yet for it, but that'll be something we'll do later.
**Ataylor**: Keeping them happy.
**Bclymer**: I'm trying to.
**Ataylor**: Nice work on that, man.
**Ataylor**: I know you guys had a bit of an obstacle there.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: To say the least.
**Bclymer**: Still not through the clear yet, but I have in writing from the fire marshal we're okay to load product.
**Bclymer**: So I told him to load product.
**Ataylor**: Is that saved in the drive?
**Bclymer**: It is.
**Bclymer**: It's.
**Bclymer**: It's all in the portal.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Like our Excel, like the government portal.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Dallas recently just moved everything over to a new portal so it's.
**Ataylor**: Oh, gotcha.
**Bclymer**: It's kind of a mess over there.
**Bclymer**: That's why I just ended up flying down figured out and then having Canon there last week really helped.
**Bclymer**: Cool.
**Ataylor**: Anything else on Ulta?
**Bclymer**: No, Dallas is good.
**Ataylor**: Thank you.
**Jdawson**: Thank you.
**Bclymer**: No, sorry, I was just going to move into Create Escape.
**Jdawson**: Yep, go ahead.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, we just have some right away punch list stuff to do and I met with them actually this morning and so we're getting it scheduled to get it taken care of this week for them.
**Bclymer**: Some cracks in the concrete.
**Bclymer**: They noticed.
**Jdawson**: Okay, thank you.
**Jdawson**: Aj Nick, Goodwill.
**Jdawson**: Bart.
**Fireflies**: I talked to CSC today and they're going to send someone out to look at the entry door.
**Fireflies**: That's the only remaining item.
**Jdawson**: Okay, this is still is in progress, Nick.
**Jdawson**: Aspire new poriti.
**Fireflies**: We're still waiting on owner payment and I need to get the warranty from our subcontractor.
**Jdawson**: Okay, thank you, Nick.
**Jdawson**: Bloomington.
**Jdawson**: Nick.
**Fireflies**: Yeah, I'm putting together a few change orders for the owner for the awnings and the windows and then also.
**Kmass**: Nick.
**Kmass**: So you can go ahead and have them do it.
**Fireflies**: Yeah, yeah, they sent me a submittal today and they're going to order the material.
**Fireflies**: They said they have an expected start date of 8:25 to start on the vault and it's approximately a one week duration.
**Fireflies**: And then I had a welder, but if we need a certified welder, I need to reach out and find another one.
**Fireflies**: And then a water fountain.
**Fireflies**: Goodwill wants a different water fountain, so I'm going to work on pricing that.
**Fireflies**: That's it for Bloomington.
**Jdawson**: Thank you, Nick.
**Jdawson**: A.J.
**Jdawson**: sorry, Alec.
**Jdawson**: Civa Consulting Building.
**Gducharme**: Yep, we had the drawings dropped off for permit about a week ago.
**Gducharme**: I called the township personally last Thursday because that was one of the only days that they were open to check on the status of it.
**Gducharme**: They said that the inspector had just picked them up last Thursday and they said it takes about two weeks for him to get them back.
**Gducharme**: So I'm going to follow back up again this Thursday in case we got lucky.
**Gducharme**: But yeah, that's really the state of that right now.
**Gducharme**: And then I'm going to follow up with Rob Ramsey on material procurement.
**Gducharme**: He keeps pushing the date back on when he receives it, but he told me he was expecting it today at 2 o'.
**Bclymer**: Clock.
**Gducharme**: Haven't heard anything back yet, but I'm going to follow up.
**Jdawson**: Okay, thank you.
**Jdawson**: Alec Meek, Goodwill Corp. Office Car cut.
**Fireflies**: Yeah, we're Waiting on a letter from the city for approval and then we'll schedule the subcontractors.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Glenn.
**Jdawson**: Westfield Collective.
**Jmendez**: Westfield Collective has become the most exciting project in the company.
**Jmendez**: Last week we had a shootout with police come by our area and the whole area got locked down.
**Jmendez**: Today one of our subcontractors drove a stolen truck to work and was followed into the site by about six police cars with their guns drawn and they arrested him.
**Jmendez**: Aside from that, we have moved forward with getting our equipment settled up with Fight and moving forward with the other subcontractor cns.
**Jmendez**: They Jeff from that company needs to get me updated pricing on some equipment that is being provided by Fight now that we have confirmation on that.
**Jmendez**: So I can write him his subcontract once he gives me that pricing back.
**Jmendez**: Let's see, we have.
**Jmendez**: I've been running scope reviews with all the guys who had bids due last week.
**Jmendez**: Most of them got them in except for I'm still waiting on the marble, the tile and the casework.
**Jmendez**: Other than that, the electricians will meet with us and the owner tomorrow to finalize some power locations for stuff for the build out as well as some stuff that they want to put there in the future like some golf simulators and need to have power for.
**Jmendez**: And then we'll wrap up pricing and be able to present that to the owner hopefully Thursday or Friday.
**Jmendez**: Last thing is the city.
**Jmendez**: Michael Pierce with the city finally got back with me about the trail.
**Jmendez**: They are going to handle doing the trail from basically our entrance on the west side of our entrance.
**Jmendez**: We'll put the curb in for the ADA ramp and then leave the rest give them a value of it.
**Jmendez**: And Jesse, I wanted to get with you about that to see how we give them the price because we gave or Ashton gave him breakdown pricing for what all the public right away stuff would cost.
**Jmendez**: The perimeter trail, the right away, the curbs and it's all kind of broken out so they have a value based on that and the value they have is higher than the credit that I'd be getting back for Alec.
**Jmendez**: So would we want to write it for the lesser amount or the full amount to.
**Jmendez**: To the city to let them know what the cost is?
**Jmendez**: Jesse me or Jesse D. Jesse Dawson probably.
**Jmendez**: I don't know.
**Jmendez**: Well actually I don't know if Jesse Dawson was even aware of this.
**Jmendez**: I talked to Brandon about it.
**Jmendez**: Are you aware of this job, Dawson?
**Kmass**: Yeah, I've heard about it.
**Kmass**: You're saying that it's going to cost us more work, cost us more to do the work than no.
**Jmendez**: So the city is going to take over doing the perimeter trail.
**Jmendez**: Basically we had 820ft of it and we're going to, we're going to only do I think 45ft of it now.
**Jmendez**: So they'll do all of the rest when they do their traffic circle next year.
**Jmendez**: The value of that work that they have is $48,000 based on Ashton's pricing when he gave his, you know, values for the public, public works and right away stuff at the beginning of the project to right away, you know, permit.
**Jmendez**: So they have that value.
**Jmendez**: So my credit back From Howard is 40 grand and the city has it as that work costing 48,000 less about.
**Jmendez**: It'd be about 45,000 after because we do have 3,000 of work still to do.
**Jmendez**: So do I give them that $45,000 price and say it's going to cost more to them?
**Jmendez**: So we retain.
**Jmendez**: I mean either way we're going to have, we're going to have a $40,000 credit back from Howard on the asphalt.
**Jmendez**: I just don't know which value to give to them.
**Jmendez**: If it benefits us to give them the lower, the higher value.
**Kmass**: Giving the money to the city.
**Jmendez**: We don't give them any money.
**Jmendez**: We just let them know what the value is.
**Bclymer**: I mean believe.
**Jmendez**: I don't think we give them any money.
**Jmendez**: But I haven't done this before.
**Kmass**: Well, if you added it, they would have charged you 52,000 because you're deducting it.
**Kmass**: You're only going to get 40.
**Kmass**: So it is only going to be.
**Bclymer**: Worth.
**Kmass**: Whatever amount you get back.
**Kmass**: So you can tell them that's all I got back from my subport.
**Jmendez**: The 40,000?
**Kmass**: Yeah.
**Jmendez**: Do you in your experience, are we going to have to pay the city that 40,000 so that they can do the perimeter trail work next year on their own?
**Kmass**: Well, Fritz Engineering is not a contractor.
**Kmass**: He's just guessing what stuff costs.
**Kmass**: So like that's why I don't know.
**Kmass**: That's why I asked about that.
**Kmass**: Do we pay the city?
**Kmass**: Do we have to pay them that much?
**Jmendez**: That's why that's what I don't know.
**Bclymer**: Well, can you find out about it?
**Njepson**: I need to find out these details before you come and ask us to make a decision without all the information.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, let's go through this when we go through that other thing after the meeting.
**Ataylor**: Glenn, that change order.
**Jmendez**: Nothing else.
**Jdawson**: Thank you, Glenn.
**Jdawson**: Alec Cormark exotech.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Gducharme**: So final documentation for the inspection is received.
**Gducharme**: I have that saved in our shared drive seven Hills also sent me their warranty.
**Gducharme**: Really Only thing left to do for them is get them a PO for the restock fee and the shipping.
**Njepson**: So you remember what we said last week like this should be updated.
**Njepson**: So you should have a task in here that says whatever it is that needs to get done.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, that's what I have on for a 11.
**Bclymer**: Right here.
**Njepson**: No below.
**Njepson**: See where it says tasks.
**Gducharme**: Oh I see.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Gducharme**: Got it.
**Bclymer**: My bad.
**Jdawson**: So the task will be send PO.
**Jdawson**: That's a task.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, send PO 27 hills.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Gducharme**: Thank you.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Of course.
**Jdawson**: And then this is you, Alec.
**Jdawson**: The same person is Alec.
**Jdawson**: And then let's make this priority high and then let's do these.
**Jdawson**: When are you think you're going to send the PO Today?
**Jdawson**: Tomorrow.
**Gducharme**: I was going to see if I can get with Keba or Nick or something to show me how to do that.
**Gducharme**: But I think I can probably get that done tomorrow.
**Jdawson**: Let's leave it for tomorrow just in case.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Kmass**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Thank you.
**Jdawson**: Of course.
**Jdawson**: Nick Spires and Lucy.
**Fireflies**: I need to get the warranty document from the subcontractor and also final payment.
**Njepson**: So you need to have a task showing warranty docs need collected, correct?
**Fireflies**: Yes.
**Njepson**: And when that's going to get done by so you can get in there and create that.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: A.J.
**Jdawson**: neiman holding FedEx.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So we got sprinkler and overhead work going on today.
**Bclymer**: Plumbing in wall actually finished today.
**Bclymer**: We're going to call for our inspection in today.
**Bclymer**: Tomorrow there's a couple things that need to be cleaned up before they get in there.
**Bclymer**: And then we've already started hanging drywall.
**Bclymer**: So we'll continue with hanging drywall and finishing this week.
**Bclymer**: And then I would expect grid to start going in probably middle of next week.
**Bclymer**: We also have footers being dug for the front new entrance.
**Bclymer**: And then I was able to finally meet with the mason today to get a contract in order.
**Bclymer**: So we're moving along there.
**Bclymer**: I gotta look into the sign permit.
**Bclymer**: Alex and I are going to actualize the schedule tomorrow morning.
**Bclymer**: Got a couple more open items that I'll be able to figure out in our bi weekly meeting with FedEx tomorrow.
**Bclymer**: Some electrical expectations.
**Bclymer**: And then I just wrote in there just in the task to confirm my door order.
**Bclymer**: I released it over a week ago.
**Bclymer**: I just want to make sure that they can give me a delivery date here in the next couple, couple weeks.
**Kmass**: So all these things that say they're not started, they're actually started.
**Kmass**: Or.
**Bclymer**: I guess I could mark confirmed or order as in progress.
**Njepson**: So the Masonry contract.
**Njepson**: What's going on with that again?
**Bclymer**: We.
**Bclymer**: We added lintels to it and he.
**Bclymer**: He backed out.
**Bclymer**: And then I was like, man, I really need you to do this because I have your number plugged because he just got so buried.
**Bclymer**: He.
**Bclymer**: He got buried by a job.
**Bclymer**: And so honestly it works out great because I'm going to use.
**Bclymer**: I'm going to use him and the in the kind of issues we've had with that front entrance to push the schedule back a little bit.
**Bclymer**: We're right on schedule to finish from what I have proposed.
**Bclymer**: But I'm going to use that to send him a new schedule here tomorrow morning.
**Njepson**: So you are going to use the same mason or not?
**Bclymer**: I am going to use the same mason.
**Bclymer**: He just can't join up.
**Bclymer**: He just can't start for another five weeks.
**Njepson**: So you just need to get a contract to him.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, he owes me pricing today about the lineal foot of the lintels he's going to put in for me.
**Bclymer**: I'll mark all these as in progress.
**Bclymer**: How's that sound?
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Njepson**: Need to update your due dates too.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I'm doing it right now.
**Jdawson**: AJ Daniel Theater.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, so we got approved to.
**Bclymer**: To at least do the design.
**Bclymer**: So I owe for the added loft.
**Bclymer**: I got Andres a contract.
**Bclymer**: We agreed on a price.
**Bclymer**: I gotta buy some kit.
**Bclymer**: We're just getting stuff from Lowe's so I gotta buy that out here.
**Bclymer**: We're sanded drywall this week.
**Bclymer**: Andres is doing some added work that he said he can handle under his scope.
**Bclymer**: So I owe him a CO for that.
**Bclymer**: But that one's.
**Bclymer**: That one's putzing along.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Don't forget to update your due dates as well here.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Apply ENGINEER OFFICE REMODEL.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so I just added in this last task here after I was just meeting there for the last two hours.
**Bclymer**: Applied missed it.
**Bclymer**: You know, we don't.
**Bclymer**: We have 480 run into these existing vavs that we took out and I mean we definitely should have caught it earlier as well.
**Bclymer**: So I, I've already got on our guys in the field for that.
**Bclymer**: But a bunch of the old VAVs we take out, they all have 480 power running to them.
**Bclymer**: And all the new ones that were approved, there are proof submittals from applied, but they're all 208.
**Bclymer**: So we got to figure out how we can get 208 to 8 vavs basically.
**Bclymer**: And right now we don't have room for it.
**Bclymer**: So we may have to step down from this 480 panel we have and put a new transformer in.
**Bclymer**: But I had the conversation on site with them, so they're aware of it.
**Bclymer**: You know, it's going to.
**Bclymer**: Depending on what we have to do, it's going to be a change order.
**Bclymer**: But it's a perfect example of what is always preached to trust but verify.
**Bclymer**: Because we have approved submittals from Applied Engineering and everybody made the assumption that what was spec'd on the drawings was what's available there.
**Bclymer**: And now we're finding out when we're ready to go install them that they're all 480.
**Bclymer**: So we're going to continue with the VAV install.
**Bclymer**: We just.
**Bclymer**: We got to find somewhere where we can pull this 208 from.
**Jdawson**: Okay, thank you.
**Jdawson**: A.J.
**Jdawson**: glenn.
**Jdawson**: Jesse.
**Jdawson**: Sorry.
**Jdawson**: Seminole Collective.
**Kmass**: No update on that.
**Njepson**: Do we have an estimate for that one or.
**Njepson**: No.
**Bclymer**: We don't.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Hey, thank you, Jesse.
**Jdawson**: Jesse R. Poor Collective.
**Kmass**: Other than the parking lot, that's the one you turned into the city manager.
**Ataylor**: Apologize.
**Ataylor**: I didn't know I was filling this out.
**Kmass**: Port Collective, we're still waiting on the city to sign the owner's contract and they'll let us release the design team.
**Ataylor**: And the proposals went to the owner.
**Kmass**: Correct for the design?
**Njepson**: Yeah, they.
**Njepson**: They've got all the estimates.
**Njepson**: It's just we're not.
**Njepson**: We're not pulling the trigger until the city signs the contract.
**Njepson**: Right now they.
**Njepson**: The first original acres went through and was voted on and passed to do it.
**Njepson**: There should be a vote I think next month on the additional three, which is where the hotel goes.
**Njepson**: And then after that they should be able to sign the contract.
**Njepson**: So we're talking October, November, time frame.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Anything else to add here?
**Jdawson**: Actually, this is the GC license, so it's taking a long time for the Georgia one to get it.
**Jdawson**: So just need to wait on that as well.
**Jdawson**: That's an art still, we need to follow up on that.
**Jdawson**: Jesse, are something else here in this project?
**Ataylor**: No, we don't have anything else.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Goodwill, Tremont, Nick.
**Fireflies**: We're working on Pyramid drawings and then Goodwill.
**Fireflies**: I guess it's going to do higher H Vac and painters.
**Fireflies**: So I just need to update that estimate.
**Jdawson**: Thank you.
**Jdawson**: Nika Keva, Uniqlo, New Jersey.
**Jremillard**: Yes.
**Jremillard**: So I have received updated electrical drawings and sprinkler drawings from the engineers this afternoon.
**Jremillard**: I'm going to go through those, review it and then send it out to the subcontractors tomorrow.
**Jremillard**: And working on finalizing the numbers for.
**Jremillard**: Excuse me.
**Jremillard**: For our change order for the additional sprinkle heads and I did a quick review with Brandon so I need to, I'm reaching out to job planner, see if we can have align for schedule impact on our change orders.
**Jremillard**: We, we are still waiting on Chris to send us tags for the plumbing pipes.
**Jremillard**: He sent us an email today saying that he received them and he's going to drop them off tomorrow morning.
**Jremillard**: So Mike will take a picture so we can, we can send it to the inspector for our final approval on plumbing.
**Bclymer**: Hello.
**Jremillard**: The rfi.
**Jremillard**: We received the email for the concrete finish from Ted on site.
**Jremillard**: So basically we'll be, we'll be doing concrete polishing, grinding and sealing on the outside of the rooms and inside we're doing epoxy paint finish.
**Jremillard**: So Mike and I are working on getting pricing for that and we are also talking to Chris to see how we can resolve that issue.
**Jremillard**: And I think that's it for UNICO right now.
**Jdawson**: Thank you.
**Jdawson**: Kevin AJ Memphis Colt Phase 2.
**Bclymer**: So I got the budget changed in here.
**Bclymer**: I'll mark that as done.
**Bclymer**: The only backup I'm waiting for this proposal is from Kimich and they said that they would get it to me.
**Bclymer**: So I'll follow up with them again here at the end of the day.
**Bclymer**: And other than that, that job is, is no longer.
**Bclymer**: So I got an Invoice for the 46k from, from mid south and I'm just going to Brandon.
**Bclymer**: I talked with Jesse about it, you know, last week as far as the numbers that we added and we talked about maybe fudging the proposals we had.
**Bclymer**: But I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna send them our summary and show them all of our general conditions that we have included on it.
**Njepson**: Yeah, I mean if we've got again, you know, we've got added like you had to go there.
**Njepson**: We've got at a cost like I mean it shouldn't be hard to justify.
**Bclymer**: So if you look at the budget, I put all that under just like GC's general requirements and then I need to double check because it's looking like, I mean this just must have just gotten updated and changed not too long ago.
**Bclymer**: But all I have is a proposal here for 10 grand for structural and it's looking like it's popping up twice in the costs, the direct costs.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Njepson**: Okay, we'll just, I'll look at it, figure it out and get with accounting on it.
**Bclymer**: Other than that, everything else seems to be populating correctly and then we'll.
**Bclymer**: And we're missing five grand somewhere.
**Bclymer**: So right now I have 12,898 budgeted that Kimage said he billed us, and only 7,897 is popping up in the budget.
**Bclymer**: So I'll deal with accounting and figure that out.
**Bclymer**: Okay, but that's all been changed.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: If you get a copy of that bill, then you can do it.
**Njepson**: So is that Kimmich bill?
**Njepson**: Is that for Memphis?
**Bclymer**: Are you looking at it right now?
**Njepson**: No, I'm asking you the question.
**Bclymer**: Yes, so.
**Njepson**: So just make sure.
**Njepson**: Make sure you put that as a task to find that so that you don't forget.
**Bclymer**: What's more concerning is this $20,000 hit on structural when we only have.
**Kmass**: A.
**Bclymer**: Proposal for 10,000, so.
**Njepson**: Right, but you said that's a double entry or do we actually pay?
**Bclymer**: Well, that's what I need to find out.
**Bclymer**: I don't know.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I just caught that this afternoon.
**Jdawson**: Thank you.
**Jdawson**: AJ Glenn, Goodwill Foundations.
**Jmendez**: Goodwill Foundations is wrapping up.
**Jmendez**: Got the rest of the cabinets showed up today.
**Jmendez**: The guys are showing up this afternoon, about an hour ago to start assembling those and setting them.
**Jmendez**: Got the middle and the top floor done with final clean today.
**Jmendez**: And the electrician is setting up the rest of the lights.
**Jmendez**: J and L should be done with their painting probably tonight or in the morning.
**Jmendez**: The cleaners will come back at some point this week and wrap up the bottom floor if they need to.
**Jmendez**: They cleaned up as much as they could today.
**Jmendez**: Other than that, we are looking to get wrapped up here pretty soon.
**Jmendez**: I got countertops.
**Jmendez**: That field measured on Friday.
**Jmendez**: Those will be in sometime next week instead, about 10 days.
**Jmendez**: So expecting those maybe Tuesday or Wednesday to arrive next week and get put in.
**Jmendez**: The brackets are already mounted, so all they got to do is come in and set them and cock it and we're done.
**Jdawson**: Okay, perfect.
**Jdawson**: Coramdale.
**Jdawson**: AJ.
**Bclymer**: Did we finish the path last week?
**Bclymer**: I gotta send them our final bill.
**Njepson**: Glenn, do you have all your cozat docs for foundations?
**Jmendez**: I don't have them all yet, no.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Njepson**: You might want to put that as a task on there to collect them.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: I'll fix this for you, Glenn, because for some reason, you cannot put it as a task.
**Jdawson**: You put it as a.
**Jdawson**: As a to do.
**Jdawson**: So I'll fix this for you.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so leave it there, but I'll fix it.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jmendez**: The format got messed up.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, exactly.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: The format is not the right one, but I'll fix it.
**Jdawson**: It's okay.
**Jdawson**: Ad.
**Jdawson**: You were saying, Coramdale?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, we.
**Bclymer**: We finished the path last week.
**Bclymer**: The guys are going to get there to seed and Straw.
**Bclymer**: But I need to get them our, our.
**Bclymer**: Our final bill.
**Bclymer**: They added in a railing which has been ordered, but I already built them for it in the last building.
**Bclymer**: So I'll just.
**Bclymer**: I'm going to send them another bill for the path portion and we'll be.
**Bclymer**: We'll have that job wrapped up.
**Bclymer**: I'll get going on some closeout docs for him.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Radio Martin's wheel.
**Jremillard**: Nothing on that yet.
**Njepson**: What do you mean nothing on that?
**Njepson**: What exactly is like what's going on?
**Bclymer**: So they don't know what.
**Bclymer**: So we have two jobs in there right now, Brandon.
**Bclymer**: We have Radial Martinsville, which was all that original move right in the demo.
**Bclymer**: And, and right now they haven't given.
**Bclymer**: JP hasn't given us any movement on like what to do next there.
**Bclymer**: But we have a separate estimating one for Radial Godiva, which we did send a proposal for.
**Bclymer**: And they're making him get two other prices from local guys.
**Bclymer**: But obviously JP wants to use us, so he said he'll let us know where we have to be at.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: He's out of town all week.
**Bclymer**: He's in Europe.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Radio Avon.
**Jdawson**: This is also Keva Easy.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So we are set to get done with.
**Bclymer**: We have.
**Bclymer**: We have five doc seals left to do on the inbound side and we have five levelers left to do.
**Bclymer**: So they'll get the levelers done probably end today, tomorrow, Friday, Wednesday morning.
**Bclymer**: And then Kurt will come in behind them and get the seals installed.
**Bclymer**: And then right now we're just wrapping up getting power to those now that they're there.
**Bclymer**: So we're well ahead of schedule on that, which is awesome to get.
**Jdawson**: All.
**Bclymer**: All those doors done.
**Bclymer**: And then all that's remaining is some electrical.
**Bclymer**: And then they just added in a new.
**Bclymer**: A new fence crash bar we.
**Bclymer**: They want us to do and a couple other things.
**Bclymer**: I have a pretty lengthy punch list that just continues to grow as they add.
**Bclymer**: So we just got approved keba to not popping up on that one that you see.
**Bclymer**: But if you look at mine, I added in a couple tasks there.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: That I tagged you in.
**Bclymer**: We just got a.
**Bclymer**: A release for the little sleepies drops.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: Okay, you want to get a CO put together for.
**Bclymer**: For deem and we can get them released because they'll want that done here, knowing them in the next week.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, I think I. I created it already.
**Jremillard**: I sent it to you on Friday.
**Bclymer**: Well, I have the CEO that we.
**Bclymer**: That I sent to JP against the approval.
**Bclymer**: I never saw the one.
**Bclymer**: That's for Dean though.
**Jremillard**: Okay, I'll check.
**Jremillard**: I thought I did send it over.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I mean, they're gonna.
**Bclymer**: They already know about it.
**Bclymer**: William was starting to work on it, but we.
**Bclymer**: We just owe that to him to keep the books up.
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Sign or cancer permit.
**Jdawson**: What is this?
**Njepson**: That should be done.
**Njepson**: That project's done.
**Njepson**: So you can close it complete.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, this one here is basically.
**Jdawson**: This one was actually done as well.
**Jdawson**: Correct.
**Njepson**: You have all your close up docks.
**Bclymer**: Oh, I don't have any closeout docks.
**Jmendez**: On that one, Brandon.
**Njepson**: You haven't collected them or there aren't any?
**Bclymer**: I mean, we had two service guys for.
**Bclymer**: For plumbing and.
**Bclymer**: And for one sprinkler head.
**Bclymer**: Move.
**Bclymer**: I'll get something writing from Andreas for a warranty.
**Bclymer**: He doesn't really do close out docs, but they haven't requested it, so.
**Bclymer**: Something that small, I didn't think we needed one.
**Bclymer**: What do you think?
**Njepson**: I mean, so you're telling me if they call us in four months to fix something, we won't do it?
**Bclymer**: No, I mean they won't call us to fix something.
**Bclymer**: There's nothing to fix.
**Bclymer**: We.
**Bclymer**: We infilled two doors and we demoed some plumbing for them.
**Bclymer**: So I. I hope there's nothing to fix.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Njepson**: I mean, if we didn't do anything, then.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So complete.
**Jdawson**: Aj.
**Bclymer**: They've paid us in full, haven't they, Brandon?
**Njepson**: I'm not sure.
**Njepson**: I'd have to go look and see in the job.
**Njepson**: You should be able to look in there and sell.
**Njepson**: So why don't you just put that as a task?
**Njepson**: Like say, confirm paid in full.
**Bclymer**: They did.
**Bclymer**: You can close it out, Maria.
**Jdawson**: Sure.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Complete.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, it shows it in job planner.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Nick, Aspire Kissimmee.
**Fireflies**: I need to get the warranty from the subcontractor and also final payment.
**Jdawson**: Okay, thank you, Nick.
**Jdawson**: Rail bronze for aj.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, the added guardrail is going to get done tomorrow.
**Bclymer**: I can bill for that last ten grand.
**Bclymer**: I'll get some.
**Bclymer**: I'll get some warranty letters from David Electric.
**Bclymer**: Brandon, have you done closeout docs with radial in the past?
**Bclymer**: Even operating under a po?
**Njepson**: Yeah, I mean, I've always will upgrade.
**Njepson**: I don't know if I've ever had a contract with them to be honest.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Goodwill Decayer was also done correctly.
**Jmendez**: Goodwill Decatur complete.
**Njepson**: You got all your cozad docs collected already?
**Jmendez**: I already submitted them.
**Bclymer**: Good to go.
**Njepson**: You already submitted them all, you said?
**Jmendez**: I sent them all to Andrew and he confirmed he's good to go with them.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so complete gpc, Harrisburg Alec?
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Gducharme**: I made the note in there.
**Gducharme**: I was trying to add a task here a minute ago.
**Gducharme**: For some reason, the tool's not working for me, but I was going to add a task in there to get the drawings to the fire marshal for the town of Mannheim, Pennsylvania.
**Gducharme**: I left a message for the fire department today trying to get his contact info with no response just yet.
**Gducharme**: If I don't hear back from them tomorrow morning, I'm going to call again.
**Gducharme**: Might just shoot a email to their general.
**Njepson**: You need to also get those in.
**Gducharme**: Case in the meantime, but you need.
**Njepson**: To get them to the design team.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: Is that going right to high tech then?
**Gducharme**: Gary?
**Njepson**: No, the.
**Njepson**: The calls that you're on, it's like every Monday or something like that.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, we.
**Gducharme**: We hopped on that just for a moment today, and no one had showed up.
**Gducharme**: Is it.
**Gducharme**: Is it Kevin?
**Njepson**: I don't know, but I'm just telling you, you need to make sure that you send a copy of the permitted drawings to them.
**Gducharme**: Got it.
**Gducharme**: Now, is that before or after I get it approved from the fire marshal?
**Njepson**: I'd probably send it before.
**Gducharme**: Okay, got it.
**Jdawson**: Alex, you should be able now to edit the tool.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: I fix it for you, so you should be able to add a task.
**Jdawson**: Okay, perfect.
**Gducharme**: Thank you.
**Jdawson**: Of course.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so we were on gpc.
**Jdawson**: Hard dispute.
**Jdawson**: Okay, this is aj If I'm not wrong.
**Jdawson**: Nick, they're all in homes.
**Njepson**: You muted, Nick?
**Njepson**: Still muted.
**Fireflies**: I need to schedule the final inspection and submit the final invoice and.
**Fireflies**: Okay, warranty as well.
**Jdawson**: Okay, thank you, Nick.
**Jdawson**: Any other projects that are current that we need to add to the list, guys, before we move on to estimating?
**Jdawson**: Okay, Moving to estimating.
**Jdawson**: A.J.
**Jdawson**: stop it.
**Jdawson**: Orthodontist.
**Bclymer**: No update from last week.
**Bclymer**: I told him I'd follow up with him here in the middle of August, so give him a little time.
**Jdawson**: Okay, we have next.
**Jdawson**: This is Brandon.
**Jdawson**: Mix use Ky.
**Njepson**: Yeah, we're.
**Njepson**: It's in the owner's court, just waiting on their feedback.
**Njepson**: So no movement.
**Jdawson**: Paradise aisle.
**Jdawson**: This is Jesse from Brandon too.
**Njepson**: Jesse, I'm meeting with the owners tomorrow morning to kind of go through stuff and make sure we're all on the same page.
**Njepson**: So, you know, from that we'll get feedback and, you know, I'll be able to kind of let you know what.
**Njepson**: What they say and what.
**Njepson**: What they want to do.
**Bclymer**: Good.
**Jdawson**: No Excel Center.
**Fireflies**: Yeah, we met with Goodwill today.
**Fireflies**: We're updating.
**Fireflies**: Updating the floor plan and then we'll.
**Fireflies**: We'll start creating the permit documents after we have the floor plan approval from Goodwill.
**Njepson**: All right, you need to get.
**Njepson**: Did.
**Njepson**: Do you have a number for design from DKGR or whoever we're using?
**Fireflies**: Yeah, I do have a number from that.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Njepson**: So they should be able to get that four point updated based off the notes that you give them and then make sure that you send them the CAD file so they have that base plan so they don't have to redraw it.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Ulta Beauty.
**Jdawson**: Fresno.
**Jdawson**: A.J.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So I. I think we got.
**Bclymer**: Did we get officially approved, Brandon?
**Njepson**: I mean it's.
**Njepson**: It's coming.
**Njepson**: I'm not pushing him because we don't have a license yet, so.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Njepson**: But yeah, I mean, I'm pretty confident it is.
**Njepson**: I mean we need to, you know, tasks for you guys or to.
**Njepson**: To get, you know, locked in pricing.
**Njepson**: Yeah, like, you know, we don't have any.
**Ataylor**: We did get structural today for design.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So we're working on getting that.
**Bclymer**: I know we got candon pounded in the phones for us.
**Bclymer**: Now we have at least one guy at least giving us a general budget for the structural.
**Bclymer**: Obviously we're not going to know until we actually design it, figure out a location for these places.
**Njepson**: But I mean, we're only beefing up.
**Njepson**: I mean the thing is.
**Njepson**: And then we're beefing up five spots, right?
**Njepson**: We have five units.
**Njepson**: So.
**Njepson**: Yeah, you just put it, you know, put a little square on the drawing, which I think Jesse already did, and it should be sitting on a girt line, a corner of a column, you know, and then, you know, even if we had to add another girt, like I would think we would just reinforce half that girder or even if we had to add a second girder like to double it up, I mean, which I.
**Njepson**: We wouldn't have to do, but I mean we should.
**Bclymer**: You can't imagine us having to add like any point loads going down from the deck, extra columns or something because I mean, I've some big units, 70 ton units to put on the roof.
**Bclymer**: It'd be nice.
**Bclymer**: I mean, from all the guys we talked to.
**Bclymer**: I don't know.
**Bclymer**: Jesse R. If you talk to anyone else, but there's no room around the building to put.
**Bclymer**: Put them on the ground outside anywhere.
**Bclymer**: Which stinks.
**Njepson**: Yeah, I mean there's no.
**Njepson**: I mean, at a column.
**Njepson**: I mean there's no way.
**Njepson**: Like that would be ridiculous.
**Njepson**: I mean, how heavy are the units?
**Bclymer**: I forget.
**Bclymer**: Let me.
**Kmass**: I had it pulled up here.
**Njepson**: So you guys need to put a task on here, you know, of firm up numbers.
**Njepson**: Right.
**Njepson**: And when, when we can get that £8,000 or something.
**Bclymer**: The ones I'm seeing.
**Njepson**: I mean, I would think that, I.
**Bclymer**: Mean I don't think anywhere between 4,508 and £11,000.
**Njepson**: Yeah, I don't, I wouldn't see adding a column, but no.
**Ataylor**: And that original structural engineer has been very responsive.
**Ataylor**: He's emailed back since we've been at the meeting, so we should have that clarification very soon.
**Njepson**: Good deal.
**Bclymer**: Well, we're working on getting that locked in pricing, Brandon.
**Bclymer**: That way once we do get that license, we can just pull the trigger.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: In this bar, California license, the package is being sent out already by Ashley.
**Jdawson**: And then once we got a tracking number for the license, we'll just get over from there making sure everything is in order so we can get the license soon.
**Jdawson**: So that's that.
**Jdawson**: Jesse tampa off his building.
**Kmass**: There's nothing new on that.
**Jdawson**: Nick.
**Jdawson**: Goodwill store front modifications.
**Fireflies**: The next time they have a school break, we're going to schedule the subcontractors.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Njepson**: So we've given them an estimate, they've approved it.
**Njepson**: And we, I mean the next school break is going to be Labor Day.
**Kmass**: Andrew said they had.
**Kmass**: Yeah, like a week in September.
**Kmass**: Yeah, it would be Christmas break after that.
**Njepson**: Okay, so we're going to start it in like this, this break Labor Day or something or.
**Kmass**: But we, like I said, we may do one of them, maybe one of the easier ones in the break and then push the other two off for Christmas break.
**Kmass**: Just depends what the subs think they can get done and whatever break that is.
**Kmass**: So.
**Njepson**: All right, so you, so Nick, one task you need to have on here is confirmed timelines and then.
**Njepson**: Yeah, I mean that's, that's, that's a big one.
**Njepson**: And then if we, if they approve the number.
**Njepson**: Did we give them a number?
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Njepson**: I mean then we could probably put that to a job, can't we?
**Kmass**: Yeah, it needs to be turned into a job.
**Kmass**: Nick, you just asked Andrew about the PO So they can get that issued to us.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Kmass**: Or I don't know if it's three separate POs because it's three different schools.
**Jdawson**: Okay, Jesse.
**Jdawson**: Nick.
**Jdawson**: Biolab expansion.
**Kmass**: So that I just updated that there's a meet.
**Kmass**: We have a meeting Wednesday at 2pm to review the proposal options we gave.
**Jdawson**: Okay, thank you, Jesse.
**Jdawson**: A.J.
**Jdawson**: vermion Rice Building addition.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I know.
**Bclymer**: Brandon met with Mark on Friday and right now I'm working on getting a separate proposal for Just Design.
**Bclymer**: So I started calling some guys today.
**Bclymer**: No luck with HWC Engineering, but Meaning.
**Njepson**: They don't want to do it or they didn't answer.
**Bclymer**: They didn't answer.
**Bclymer**: So I called their Terre Haute office.
**Bclymer**: But I. I also Rio let him.
**Njepson**: Type his tasks in.
**Njepson**: That's part of their job.
**Njepson**: So.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I put in their separate design proposal.
**Njepson**: I know, but somebody's typing right now for you.
**Bclymer**: Oh.
**Kmass**: I was putting it in just on our end.
**Kmass**: I was going to work with him to get us get plans together that we could put on Plan Hub and actually start soliciting bids that way.
**Njepson**: Yeah, that's.
**Njepson**: We need that.
**Bclymer**: I'll.
**Njepson**: I'll message Mark again and then.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, and then.
**Bclymer**: So tomorrow I put something on the schedule.
**Bclymer**: Brandon, I'm not sure if you saw, but I know me and Alec are gonna meet tomorrow and work on dividing and conquer and Al compound the phones and Jesse's gonna join us as well.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So I sent you the invite.
**Bclymer**: Is it optional?
**Njepson**: When can you get me that design proposal?
**Bclymer**: I'm gonna try to get.
**Bclymer**: I mean here in the next.
**Bclymer**: I don't know, end of the week.
**Bclymer**: Is that okay?
**Bclymer**: Is that.
**Njepson**: No, I mean, I. I at least need a. I mean, I would we.
**Njepson**: You plug 250.
**Njepson**: I would think that.
**Njepson**: I mean.
**Bclymer**: Oh, okay.
**Bclymer**: I thought you.
**Bclymer**: Oh, I'm just working on getting actual pricing.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I'll get you the separate design proposal.
**Bclymer**: I'll do it right now.
**Njepson**: Yeah, I mean, we need to pull out.
**Njepson**: You know, obviously you've got 250, you know, from the.
**Njepson**: The ad and then whatever.
**Njepson**: You know, I got numbers for the renovation as well.
**Njepson**: And then a little pre con money.
**Bclymer**: I got it right here.
**Bclymer**: All do a save as on the design proposal.
**Bclymer**: I just sent for cart.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Are you okay with it on that format?
**Bclymer**: Just a short format?
**Njepson**: No, I mean it's.
**Njepson**: He's going to want to see it the same format as the other.
**Njepson**: As the other one.
**Njepson**: Like, you know, with a.
**Bclymer**: Different than what we usually do.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Like the short form.
**Njepson**: No, this proposal that we gave him, we need to pull it out.
**Njepson**: Pull it out, create a new one.
**Njepson**: And that way we have, you know, some GCS design and then our fees and all that stuff, so.
**Njepson**: And then clarification showing what's included.
**Njepson**: This one has to go by the book.
**Njepson**: Like it's not, you know, we can't just do a short form like we do with a bunch of different other clients.
**Bclymer**: I'm creating it right now.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Jesse and Alec for 40 West Nar building.
**Kmass**: Just updated that.
**Kmass**: Spoke to Tim last week.
**Kmass**: He's waiting on the board.
**Kmass**: The condo Board to vote on the pricing to get that pricing and scope released.
**Kmass**: I think he said it'd be.
**Bclymer**: A.
**Kmass**: Few weeks before that happens.
**Kmass**: Then he's also getting us set up to meet with his boss and look at other projects they have here in Florida.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: This is Radio Godiva, Martinsville.
**Jremillard**: Yes, we have sent our pricing because we are waiting for J.P. to respond.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, Kev, I put a task in there.
**Bclymer**: We need to send that curtain.
**Bclymer**: Like what we think the deduct is going to be for that curtain price.
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: It's been on our list.
**Bclymer**: We just.
**Bclymer**: He.
**Bclymer**: He hasn't said anything about it.
**Bclymer**: I just know he's going to want it.
**Bclymer**: I know they're going to want it when they want to compare our pricing.
**Jremillard**: Yes, I just sent an email out to the vendor asking if there is any.
**Jremillard**: Because the price they sent us that I forwarded, they don't have anything on shipping.
**Jremillard**: So I was trying to see if there's any additional charges.
**Jremillard**: That way we can add it to our number.
**Jremillard**: So we give it to.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Thank you.
**Bclymer**: Welcome.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Columbus Christian Academy.
**Bclymer**: Aj yeah, we're meeting with them here in the next couple weeks, so no update until then.
**Kmass**: You create a job folder when you get these.
**Kmass**: I mean, I don't see anything in the onedrive for the last two.
**Bclymer**: Radio Godiva's in there.
**Kmass**: Well, now the last two.
**Kmass**: Columbus Christian Academy and Fargo permitting.
**Bclymer**: I didn't create one for Vargo permitting and Columbus Christian.
**Bclymer**: We don't have any files for it.
**Bclymer**: But I'll go ahead and put them in there.
**Bclymer**: They'll just be empty for now.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And the last one we have, Fargo permitting.
**Jdawson**: This is AJ as well.
**Bclymer**: He just.
**Bclymer**: I. I sent him a little short form design thing earlier today and he told me to revise it to not have the life safety plan.
**Bclymer**: So I'll send that to him and we'll probably get released on that, I would assume.
**Njepson**: When is this Christian Academy meeting?
**Njepson**: Because I don't see it on my calendar.
**Njepson**: AJ.
**Bclymer**: Columbus Christian, 8am on the 26th of August.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Sure you don't have it.
**Bclymer**: It shows you accepted.
**Njepson**: I have it.
**Njepson**: I just didn't.
**Njepson**: I didn't see other means.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, it's.
**Bclymer**: It's because he's supposed to.
**Bclymer**: He's meeting with the board to find out how much money they can.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Put towards this.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Njepson**: Anything else?
**Jdawson**: You guys let me know.
**Jdawson**: Something else to add on?
**Jdawson**: Estimating projects or current projects?
**Kmass**: I just message you two of them just so you could read it off.
**Kmass**: Were there two more goodwill projects?
**Njepson**: Oh, yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So GW Alison.
**Jdawson**: This is Indiana, correct?
**Jdawson**: Police.
**Jdawson**: All right, yeah, you can leave, guys, if you don't need anything else, I'll add these projects, Jesse, and I'll fix your formatting land for the Seminal Collective.
**Jdawson**: Okay?
**Jdawson**: Hey, guys.
**Jdawson**: Oh, no.
**Jdawson**: But this is.
**Jdawson**: No.
**Jdawson**: What is the project number, Jesse, for this one?
**Kmass**: It's in that message I sent you.
**Jdawson**: It's got all the info nobody has.
**Jdawson**: 2508 01.
**Jdawson**: And we need the.
**Jdawson**: They're both 25.
**Jdawson**: This is 25122.
**Kmass**: They're not projects yet.
**Kmass**: They're.
**Jdawson**: Oh, they're estimating.
**Jdawson**: Oh, gosh, that makes sense.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Okay, I'll let them.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Thank you, guys.
**Kmass**: Thanks.
**Ataylor**: Thank you.
**Jdawson**: Bye.
**Bclymer**: Bye.
**Bclymer**: Bye.
