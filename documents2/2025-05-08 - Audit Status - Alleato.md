## Transcript
**Bclymer**: All right, it looks like we got everybody.
**Bclymer**: Good afternoon.
**Bclymer**: For those people on the west, on the east coast.
**Bclymer**: All right, Kevin, let's.
**Bclymer**: Let's get started.
**Bclymer**: Starting with the big items.
**Bclymer**: Confirmation letters, ar, all the good stuff.
**Bclymer**: Go ahead.
**Fnjie**: Right this point, we don't have that much opens.
**Fnjie**: Just accept the contract confirmation plus 2023 AR confirmation letter, which we want to.
**Fnjie**: We need help from Brandon sand to help us to follow up those five remaining.
**Justin**: Yeah, I will.
**Justin**: I will look at those.
**Justin**: I'm pretty sure Create Escapes already sent theirs.
**Justin**: And Bart, I'll double check, but double check your stuff because I don't want to ask people to send stuff when they've already sent it.
**Fnjie**: Got it.
**Fnjie**: Okay, no problem.
**Fnjie**: So.
**Fnjie**: So I gotta jump into another meeting.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, super important.
**Bclymer**: Brandon to.
**Bclymer**: Oh, did he leave?
**Bclymer**: Okay, he had another meeting.
**Bclymer**: He said, Maria, we've sent Brandon the AR confirmations for 2020.
**Bclymer**: We sent him the.
**Bclymer**: Oops, something is happening.
**Asupit**: I can hear you.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Confirmations of the 2023 confirmations were sent to Brandon a couple times.
**Bclymer**: We need him to send those.
**Asupit**: Okay, those were already signed.
**Asupit**: Send them to the client, correct?
**Bclymer**: That's right.
**Bclymer**: Okay, super important.
**Bclymer**: And then, and then follow up on those five that we have right there.
**Bclymer**: Kevin and Jason, you guys are 100% sure we did not receive those, correct?
**Fnjie**: Correct.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: Yeah.
**Fnjie**: So those are confirmation wise.
**Fnjie**: And then the second one is just one quick question with the Fatima.
**Fnjie**: It is the one of the five samples we selected for under billing for 2023, which is 7 30,000.
**Fnjie**: Right at the selection number five.
**Fnjie**: The dollar amount, our selected amount is 10,000.
**Fnjie**: And then we are able to trace this amount to the bank statements.
**Fnjie**: But could you please guide us of Fatima in this supporting documents you provided?
**Fnjie**: How do we trace that amount to the invoice?
**Kjin**: Okay, go to the next page.
**Fnjie**: Yeah.
**Kjin**: So this was a retainage payment.
**Fnjie**: Yeah.
**Kjin**: So if you look at the second attachment, the second item I attached.
**Fnjie**: Oh, sorry.
**Kjin**: That's what you're looking for.
**Kjin**: So this was.
**Kjin**: So sometimes they'll, they'll.
**Kjin**: They'll release, you know, partial retainage on an invoice or on a payment.
**Kjin**: And it looks like this was one of those.
**Kjin**: But the item you selected was part.
**Fnjie**: Of.
**Kjin**: Was that item at the top.
**Kjin**: So if you're looking for an invoice, you're not going to see an invoice with that line item because it's a retained age payment.
**Fnjie**: Okay, so I guess the retainage percentage is 10%.
**Kjin**: Yes.
**Kjin**: But in some cases they can release five at some point during the job.
**Kjin**: And then release another five.
**Fnjie**: Okay, then do we have any kind of reconciliations work paper that how we come up with this balance?
**Fnjie**: I know this is the retainage, but we should have some kind of calculations to calculate to come up with this balance, right?
**Kjin**: I can try to find something, but.
**Bclymer**: So this is.
**Bclymer**: Kevin, this is a cost selection.
**Fnjie**: No, this is for prepaid under billing.
**Fnjie**: What's they called?
**Bclymer**: Oh, prepaid, yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: For the.
**Bclymer**: Under the 730.
**Bclymer**: Right, got it.
**Bclymer**: So this was.
**Bclymer**: Did we verify was paid in 2023, the 10,000.
**Fnjie**: It was here.
**Mcalcetero**: It was paid in 2024, actually.
**Kjin**: It was paid in 24.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so it's not a prepaid.
**Fnjie**: It's not a prepaid right now.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Is that the only one we have that we found was not paid in 23?
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, the other ones are paid in 23, but only 90%.
**Fnjie**: So, yeah, with those 10% of the return, looks like we inflated cost and under billing amounts.
**Fnjie**: So with that 10% portions, we're going to post the PJE for that 10%.
**Bclymer**: So the 10,000 is a PJE, right?
**Fnjie**: Eje.
**Kjin**: I don't, I don't think it's inflated because.
**Kjin**: So 100% of the work is done, but they only pay them 90 and they hold back retainage.
**Kjin**: So the work is done.
**Kjin**: They just didn't, you know, that's just.
**Kjin**: They just didn't pay 100%.
**Kjin**: So I wouldn't necessarily say that it's inflated because the work is done.
**Kjin**: If they were on cash basis, then I can.
**Bclymer**: Oh, so.
**Bclymer**: So in theory, the.
**Bclymer**: In 2023, the 10,000 was sitting in cost and as a AP.
**Kjin**: Yes.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So right now it's in prepaid.
**Bclymer**: So the p.
**Bclymer**: The, The.
**Bclymer**: The proposal is we reclass it from prepaids in 23 to AP in 23.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Because it's sitting right now in that balance of 730 on.
**Bclymer**: In an asset.
**Kjin**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: So it's not going to change the financials.
**Bclymer**: It's too small for us to worry about.
**Bclymer**: We just want to make sure that's.
**Bclymer**: That's correct.
**Bclymer**: Fatima, do you agree or disagree?
**Kjin**: Yeah, yeah, I agree.
**Bclymer**: So, Kevin, move on.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: Yeah, that will be it.
**Fnjie**: That will be all.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So really the main open items are the confirmations.
**Bclymer**: And all the confirmations came back clean, right?
**Justin**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: So we received six of them, correct?
**Asupit**: Yes.
**Asupit**: Which one are you missing?
