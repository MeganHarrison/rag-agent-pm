## Transcript
**Jdawson**: Any tree survey or topo or just understand any environmental items.
**Jdawson**: Just good to do it.
**Jdawson**: Check, make sure we've got that.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, they got.
**Speaker 1**: And that's the one thing I was telling them.
**Speaker 1**: Like I don't know that this guy, he drew this new building like five foot off the property line and there's these like four and six inch giant oak or I don't know, bigger oak trees right there.
**Speaker 1**: And I'm like, I can't even dig to put my building in.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jdawson**: So we'll need to make sure that all that works and, and work with the civil and any site plan approvals we've got to go through and get all that identified and located and then for the.
**Speaker 1**: But I mean he has that like.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Is that like he drew the building footprint on this plan though?
**Speaker 1**: Is that the civil engineer that.
**Speaker 1**: Isn't that his problem to figure out?
**Jdawson**: Well, it is, but we like to, to know what we're getting into.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So having a survey with that information is helpful for us so we can at least bring it up and make sure things are being addressed.
**Speaker 1**: You've got the drawings, don't you?
**Jdawson**: I've got the civil.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, the package that you sent me.
**Jdawson**: But if we can get anything in CAD too, even the, the building footprint from them will be helpful to get us started.
**Jdawson**: And then we'll use that in our.
**Jdawson**: We'll bring that into Revit and do all the, all that we do there.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, we got the landscape drawings too.
**Speaker 1**: And I probably didn't share those because I got.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I haven't seen those.
**Jdawson**: Okay, that'll be good.
**Jdawson**: Do you have a geo report?
**Speaker 1**: Yep, I got a geo report.
**Jdawson**: Cool, good.
**Jdawson**: And then the fire.
**Jdawson**: Fire hydrant flow test for the fire protection.
**Jdawson**: I'm imagining we're going to need fire protection for this.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Warehouse.
**Speaker 1**: It probably just be high up.
**Speaker 1**: Pendant heads.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: We'll need to get that.
**Jdawson**: And then if they do have any, any equipment they're going to have in here.
**Jdawson**: I think the, the MEP engineer they dug around and did a little, little research on what, what the company that.
**Jdawson**: Whatever that is, BL Bio Labs does.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So they, they tried to kind of make some assumptions on what might be in there and what they might have to.
**Speaker 1**: No, they make, they make supplement pills.
**Speaker 1**: They make like 4 million pills a day.
**Jdawson**: That's nuts.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, no wonder there's more space everyone for everything.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: Yeah but just anything, you know, that we need to coordinate for equipment, any in slab outlets or things that we need to coordinate it's just good to know what kind of equipment they're planning on so that we can provide for them as needed.
**Jdawson**: And then just regarding the exterior, if there is any company branding or anything we need to be aware of as we design the exterior, that would be super helpful as well.
**Speaker 1**: I think it will just do a stucco skim coat on the block probably.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And we can break it up.
**Jdawson**: We can do certain things or they can keep it.
**Jdawson**: I mean, I looked around on Google Earth, it's all pretty stark around there, just kind of industrial.
**Jdawson**: So maybe we'll put a little fun accent strip or something.
**Jdawson**: I don't know.
**Jdawson**: But just.
**Jdawson**: Just thoughts.
**Jdawson**: So we've got schematic and then I think with this we just jump right into CDs.
**Jdawson**: I don't think we need to have a DD set.
**Jdawson**: And then I kept CA as hourly.
**Jdawson**: Like.
**Jdawson**: Like most of our deals are with you because I know you guys end up running a lot, but that's pretty much.
**Jdawson**: Does that seem like good understanding of what.
**Jdawson**: What this is?
**Jdawson**: I think there's a maybe couple nuances, but.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So you got.
**Speaker 1**: You're gonna have the fire sprinkler.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Design.
**Speaker 1**: Electrical design, of course.
**Speaker 1**: Like if we have our subs.
**Speaker 1**: I don't know, it may be.
**Jdawson**: Well, we can, we can talk through all that.
**Jdawson**: That's kind of a starting basis, I guess to.
**Jdawson**: To fine tune it from this conversation.
**Jdawson**: Make sure that we're, you know, not overlapping with anything that you've got.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: So this is 144.
**Jdawson**: Right?
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: And that's what their hourly estimate of their construction administration.
**Jdawson**: So that, that'd be less 500.
**Jdawson**: If they don't get into CA, there may be some CA, you know, so there may be some of that in there.
**Jdawson**: If there's a generator design, that would be additional.
**Jdawson**: So we weren't sure if there was any generator.
**Jdawson**: And then a savings.
**Speaker 1**: That's the engineered metal building.
**Jdawson**: Yes, sir.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: And then MEPF is that.
**Speaker 1**: Did they include plumbing in there?
**Speaker 1**: Maybe we'd need to back that out.
**Jdawson**: So I always attach their stuff at the back is all they have electrical, plumbing.
**Jdawson**: Let's see what they did.
**Jdawson**: So they do have plumbing design, warehouse plumbing design main area.
**Jdawson**: So if there is no plumbing, is there really no plumbing?
**Speaker 1**: Only roof drainage.
**Speaker 1**: And that's something.
**Speaker 1**: If they do just gutters and downspouts.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Into the storm system.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: It would they need.
**Jdawson**: But won't they need to add some restrooms for this additional space?
**Speaker 1**: No, no, simply.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Because they have restrooms and Everything in that office area.
**Jdawson**: The.
**Speaker 1**: The building we're building around.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So I guess we just need to make sure that we.
**Jdawson**: We have enough fixtures then.
**Jdawson**: Because it is.
**Jdawson**: They do.
**Jdawson**: They do make you count so much.
**Jdawson**: So we would just have to do another.
**Jdawson**: We'd have to do a code eval.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: On.
**Jdawson**: On the existing and make sure that we're good.
**Jdawson**: We may be good.
**Jdawson**: We may be able to take that out.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: That's 1250.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: 12 to 50.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I can talk about that.
**Speaker 1**: Dense engineering.
**Jdawson**: Vinco.
**Jdawson**: Vinco Engineering.
**Jdawson**: But they, they, they've done really good for us.
**Jdawson**: They've been really responsive, easy to work with, knowledgeable.
**Jdawson**: They'll go the extra mile, make sure things are done right and on time.
**Jdawson**: So we've had a good, good working relationship with them.
**Speaker 1**: Cool.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: I never worked with them before, but I'm sure they'll be fine.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So any, Any other feedback or comments or.
**Speaker 1**: No, I think that's a good starting point.
**Speaker 1**: And you know, at least then we'll have a budget.
**Speaker 1**: We.
**Speaker 1**: I can go to them with.
**Speaker 1**: As soon as I get some of these other numbers in from the subs.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: I can throw together, get him a cost for everything and with the options to change the civil and.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Okay, sounds good.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And I'll mention it to them about the.
**Jdawson**: May not have to add any, any restrooms.
**Jdawson**: And so see what they say about that and see what they think about taking it out.
**Speaker 1**: So, yeah, I can ask him how many bathrooms are in existing.
**Speaker 1**: And like, is he, is he not able to connect these two buildings on the inside or does that open up a can of worms or is there.
**Speaker 1**: Well, but you got doorways, like from the two entrances to this building.
**Speaker 1**: You go right into that other building.
**Speaker 1**: So technically you got a bathroom right there.
**Speaker 1**: Does that count?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, so there's, there's a couple ways we can look at it.
**Jdawson**: I think if we're going to use the restrooms, we need to have that physical connection.
**Jdawson**: I think we'd have to do a little code research on all of it and making sure that adding all the square footage works with the height area tabulation requirements of the.
**Jdawson**: Of the code.
**Jdawson**: So for the type of building, the type of construction, you know, we have certain area limitations.
**Jdawson**: We might have to have that.
**Jdawson**: That wall a certain fire rating and, and the door between them have to maybe be a certain fire rating.
**Jdawson**: I don't know.
**Jdawson**: That's just something we're going to have to look at as we get into it to see how it all starts to come together.
**Jdawson**: It all depends on if the fire areas are, you know, if they work for what the code requires.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, okay.
**Speaker 1**: I think warehouses, like we got million square foot one.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah.
**Speaker 1**: There's no firewalls anywhere.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jdawson**: Just trying to see how it overall works with this, with this office.
**Jdawson**: You know, now that it's.
**Jdawson**: Now it's primarily warehouse, so it's like warehouse with this other use.
**Jdawson**: And what's the separation between those required?
**Jdawson**: Sometimes that's where you get into it.
**Speaker 1**: Well, if it's a black wall, I wonder if they're.
**Speaker 1**: We need to.
**Speaker 1**: That's why I just need to get this price together and then.
**Speaker 1**: Is that a question I should ask him now?
**Speaker 1**: Is this going to be like a.
**Speaker 1**: Just technically, in addition to that building?
**Speaker 1**: I guess it'd have to be because it's.
**Jdawson**: Well, I mean, it wouldn't have to be.
**Jdawson**: They could be standalone, but you may need to have a small restroom in there then, so it can stand alone, which may not be the end of the world.
**Jdawson**: But that's just something we need to know.
**Jdawson**: And if they do want to connect, I would like to see if we can't get some kind of existing drawings or some kind of drawings of the existing building so we know where to punch through, how we connect.
**Jdawson**: So we don't come through someone's office or the break room or.
**Jdawson**: Or something else, so we make that connection properly.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, now send it over.
**Speaker 1**: I'm trying to wrap this up by Friday and get it over to them.
**Jdawson**: Okay, sounds good.
**Jdawson**: So I'll get this over to you.
**Jdawson**: On the Georgia deal, man, I had a team.
**Jdawson**: Have you used Kimberly Horn before?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, so Kimberly Horn.
**Jdawson**: So they also have mep and I thought it'd be.
**Jdawson**: It'd work really well.
**Jdawson**: We've worked with them before, got a good relationship.
**Jdawson**: And I know the guys in the MEP team.
**Jdawson**: They do really well.
**Jdawson**: And they've got an office up there, like, near Savannah.
**Jdawson**: So I was like, oh, this is perfect.
**Jdawson**: So I had them going at it and I told them I needed it soon.
**Jdawson**: And they just told me this morning after following up with them again, that their risk department or whoever said no go because of the condo element.
**Jdawson**: So now I'm back to square one.
**Jdawson**: But I did get another team that we've worked with here on a vertical mixed use project, and they're also licensed in Georgia.
**Speaker 1**: One second.
**Jdawson**: Oh, yeah, One second.
**Jdawson**: Sure.
**Speaker 1**: All right.
**Speaker 1**: Sorry.
**Speaker 1**: As an architect from Mountain Phoenix, we got a job.
**Speaker 1**: It just like, it was like, you know, so I Asked you if you were licensed out there, this thing popped up and boom.
**Speaker 1**: It's like, it's.
**Speaker 1**: It's a go.
**Speaker 1**: Like tomorrow will probably get released.
**Jdawson**: Wow.
**Jdawson**: That's the million square feet or something, right?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: That's nuts.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Wow.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Cool, man.
**Jdawson**: That's a lot.
**Jdawson**: So, anyway, all that being said, I'm.
**Jdawson**: I'm trying to get you this one by the end of the week for Georgia.
**Jdawson**: I was hoping to get it to you sooner, but this, The MEP number is.
**Jdawson**: Is the one in flux.
**Jdawson**: So that one should be.
**Jdawson**: I'm hoping tomorrow I get it from them and I'll be able to package it up and get you the numbers on Friday.
**Speaker 1**: Perfect.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: I got everyone else's.
**Speaker 1**: I'm just waiting on yours.
**Speaker 1**: Just make it feel better.
**Jdawson**: I know, I know.
**Jdawson**: Sorry.
**Jdawson**: But I'll have.
**Jdawson**: I'll have that to you and I'll have the condo and I've the.
**Jdawson**: The other space.
**Jdawson**: I'm not sure how much like, MEP do you need from me on the addition, like all that outdoor stuff, because I think, like, all the pods are their own thing and everything's kind of its own thing.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: I mean, do you even need any MEP on that or is it all civil?
**Speaker 1**: Container yard for the.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, for all the.
**Jdawson**: The volleyball and the container yard and the like that.
**Speaker 1**: I mean, we got this civil engineer to do the plumbing connections.
**Speaker 1**: We're going to have, you know, each.
**Speaker 1**: Each of those containers will have plumbing, you know, a little restaurant connections, you know, but we won't have to design any of the food service.
**Speaker 1**: So it's simply getting water, power and sewer connection to each of the little buildings.
**Speaker 1**: And then there's a couple public restrooms.
**Speaker 1**: So there is some work with that.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so a couple public restrooms and maybe that stage thing.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, the stage.
**Speaker 1**: So I got a structural engineer.
**Speaker 1**: It's that guy out in Pennsylvania.
**Speaker 1**: He's got that, you know, the stage again, it may just be like, you know, RV hookup type power sources where they come in and plug their stage.
**Jdawson**: And that's really civil.
**Jdawson**: So really all we're looking at is the restrooms.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, the restrooms and the containers.
**Speaker 1**: If you look at that plan.
**Jdawson**: Oh, they're in the containers too.
**Speaker 1**: Well, so the containers.
**Speaker 1**: Everything's a container.
**Speaker 1**: It's either container restroom, a can container cold storage.
**Speaker 1**: There's container coffee shops and.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Bars and all that.
**Speaker 1**: So it's.
**Speaker 1**: It's not a.
**Speaker 1**: And maybe it is just civil because you're just providing connection to it.
**Speaker 1**: And then, you know, we'll just.
**Jdawson**: You.
**Speaker 1**: Know, because we may get the design done by the container people where they just turn key it and then.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, you don't have any involvement, so maybe just leave that off at this point.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I think I'm gonna leave that off at this point until it gets a little more defined.
**Jdawson**: I could give you a number for the stage if you'd like, but I'm.
**Jdawson**: It's very undefined at this point to.
**Speaker 1**: Know where there again, that's probably going to be something that they'd go to some, you know, they have these companies that make the steel.
**Speaker 1**: You know, it's like just a metal, like a erector set thing.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: That's the stage.
**Speaker 1**: I don't think it's going to be like a design thing.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Okay, well, I'll just.
**Jdawson**: I'll pause on all of that and we'll start with just the.
**Jdawson**: The hotel condo.
**Jdawson**: We'll go from there.
**Jdawson**: And if it gets to a point where, you know, we need to get involved, that's fine too.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: All right, Sounds good.
**Speaker 1**: All right, thanks.
**Speaker 1**: We'll see you.
**Jdawson**: All right, thanks, sir.
**Jdawson**: Appreciate it.
**Speaker 1**: Thank you.
**Jdawson**: Bye.
