**Kmass**: Need some colors and color.
**Kmass**: Color selections from Goodwill for paint.
**Kmass**: Other than that we will be.
**Bclymer**: You got your counter selections the paint like those critical things you need to get.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Kmass**: No other in my submittal log.
**Bclymer**: Well that hasn't done any good.
**Bclymer**: So you need to put them in here so they stay refreshed.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: This is Keva Braille Martin Seal.
**Jmendez**: This one is still on hold, but we are still finalizing the pricing.
**Jmendez**: JP wanted price breakout for.
**Jmendez**: For the data room.
**Jmendez**: AJ I don't know if you get to discuss this with him today.
**Bclymer**: So we.
**Bclymer**: I talked to.
**Fireflies**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: Oh, go ahead Jesse.
**Jdawson**: If you.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I talked to PJP out there.
**Bclymer**: They're not going to move American Express until after the holiday season.
**Bclymer**: But they still.
**Bclymer**: They have to be out of that building by February 2nd.
**Bclymer**: So we won't start right away but we'll start in a whatever time we need to to get it done by the first of the year so they can move over there.
**Bclymer**: Then we'll be doing the demo then as well.
**Bclymer**: He wants to try and figure out something else to do with the fence.
**Bclymer**: They still don't like the price of that but for now it's.
**Bclymer**: We're not going to try to get it done before.
**Jmendez**: So they're saying the.
**Jmendez**: The latest fencing pricing we sent is still high.
**Bclymer**: Well, it's more than they want to spend but I don't know they have any other options so can't get much.
**Njepson**: Cheaper than what we gave them.
**Jdawson**: As.
**Njepson**: Far as a way.
**Njepson**: A better way to build it.
**Njepson**: So.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: The problem is the what they're basing it off of is when their facility guy went and bought some two by fours and chicken wire and built it for them so they don't think.
**Bclymer**: You know, they don't have facility people to do that anymore.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Njepson**: Right.
**Bclymer**: They don't understand that other people charge money for.
**Jdawson**: Huh.
**Ataylor**: So.
**Njepson**: So that one's kind of.
**Njepson**: Kind of on the back burner right now, Kevin.
**Njepson**: Until we can get through.
**Njepson**: Until they can start getting through peak.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jmendez**: That lady has been reaching out, asking where we are at.
**Jmendez**: Margaret.
**Jmendez**: So she.
**Jmendez**: I told her we have changed the design since the last time she sent us.
**Bclymer**: Is this the same GC lady?
**Njepson**: Yeah, we should be.
**Njepson**: We shouldn't be hitting her up anymore.
**Jdawson**: Just.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, listen, we got subs that are doing this work for less.
**Bclymer**: I'm sorry, but yeah, if you're not.
**Bclymer**: We're not going to use her for that job.
**Bclymer**: I would stop talking to her and just say we got subs that are doing it.
**Bclymer**: We're going to award the fork to.
**Bclymer**: Hopefully we got other subs, but we're not using the GC there.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Fireflies**: Yep.
**Jmendez**: All right.
**Jmendez**: So that's it for that.
**Jmendez**: Maria.
**Jdawson**: Thank you.
**Ataylor**: Thank you, Kevin.
**Ataylor**: This is not yet Radial Avon.
**Jdawson**: Kevon.
**Jmendez**: We just started the installation of the View platform today.
**Jmendez**: We received material for that today and we are still working on changing or updating pricing for the electrician.
**Jmendez**: A.J.
**Jmendez**: did we.
**Jmendez**: Did he mention anything about the panels?
**Njepson**: Yeah, so I just.
**Njepson**: I was just walking with.
**Njepson**: With JP and talking with him.
**Njepson**: So what.
**Njepson**: What I.
**Njepson**: What I told him, Kevin was.
**Njepson**: I was like, JP, you're saving anywhere from 500 to a thousand bucks per drop on the microwaves.
**Njepson**: So I was like, we can't really.
**Njepson**: I don't recommend removing any because the reason we're putting a new panel over there is so we don't have such long runs going all the way over to the microwaves because these all have to be dedicated circuits.
**Njepson**: So the cheapest option is to put a new panel.
**Njepson**: I told this to JP but we'll just let him.
**Jdawson**: He.
**Njepson**: He has what he needs to make a decision.
**Njepson**: I was like, the most we can do is like, you know, 5 to 10k give back, but I don't recommend it.
**Njepson**: And so he's got what he needs, so we're good to go there.
**Njepson**: So he's going to work.
**Njepson**: He's going to work on getting everything massaged there with.
**Njepson**: With his higher up and did the.
**Bclymer**: Exact show up today.
**Njepson**: Aj no, no, none that, none that I've seen besides who you and I met this morning, Jesse, that one guy that, that was questioning if these things were movable.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: Seeing him, he's with Amazon and helping with Ops.
**Njepson**: So I know he's.
**Njepson**: He's important.
**Njepson**: So.
**Njepson**: Okay, those were.
**Njepson**: And then the other guy behind you is someone who I'd already walked with was basically not JP's boss, but his counterpart when it comes to like actually like operations there.
**Njepson**: So I don't know if he's the COO or what he is but the guy that was asking about the mezzanines, he was the one that we wanted to show progress on.
**Njepson**: So I'll send you some pictures.
**Njepson**: They're starting to look good.
**Jdawson**: Sweet.
**Bclymer**: Did you get your revised lumber package ordered?
**Bclymer**: So it's there tomorrow.
**Njepson**: I'm picking up.
**Njepson**: So for those stringers.
**Njepson**: I don't know if it's going to be there tomorrow so when I went to schedule it.
**Njepson**: But I'm picking up the eight foot stringers he needs for the staircases so he can finish that one up because he only needs 8 foot material for that.
**Njepson**: So I can put that in the back of my truck.
**Bclymer**: Are they happy we're not bolting it to the ground?
**Fireflies**: He.
**Njepson**: He doesn't really care.
**Njepson**: I was worried with how rigid it would be but he put so many braces on there.
**Jdawson**: It's.
**Njepson**: It's looking fine.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, it'll be fine.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: If not, it's Kevin's fault.
**Bclymer**: He did the design.
**Jmendez**: It's.
**Jmendez**: It's Tony's guys on the job site too.
**Njepson**: Yeah, they're kicking butt.
**Jmendez**: Okay.
**Njepson**: So we already got three doors installed.
**Njepson**: We're just gonna keep at it.
**Njepson**: They got their little sleepy stuff moved so we'll finish.
**Njepson**: The 10th door will be cut out tomorrow and they'll have all those dock doors up on that.
**Njepson**: It'd be the.
**Njepson**: What is that?
**Njepson**: The west side of the building?
**Njepson**: Inbound side.
**Njepson**: Those are all be installed by the end of the week.
**Ataylor**: Awesome.
**Njepson**: So.
**Ataylor**: Okay.

**Ataylor**: Oh, this was created from the.
**Ataylor**: I think it was created from Fritzi but we need to hide this one.
**Ataylor**: So let me just hide it as incomplete and then.
**Ataylor**: I don't know.
**Ataylor**: What is this?
**Ataylor**: Let's just get rid of this right now.
**Ataylor**: No idea.
**Ataylor**: And what is this one?
**Ataylor**: Hiero Spice split.
**Njepson**: That one's done.
**Bclymer**: Did you bill that?
**Bclymer**: There's nothing in job planner for it.
**Njepson**: Is that the 13204.
**Njepson**: Market demise.
**Njepson**: I have to.
**Njepson**: I think accounting sent me the.
**Njepson**: The invoice, so I'll shoot it over to Wes.
**Njepson**: I'm supposed to meet him tomorrow.
**Njepson**: Jesse.
**Bclymer**: Okay, but where do we.
**Bclymer**: Where's the paper trail for that job?
**Bclymer**: There's just nothing.
**Njepson**: Yeah, I mean, we did it all on time and material, so once I get invoices, I'll input them.
**Njepson**: We get time and material for the sprinkler head move.
**Njepson**: We did a service call for the plumbing move, and then I had Andreas, one of my Latino framers, do the drywall.
**Njepson**: So I'll get all that caught up in there for you to look at.
**Ataylor**: AJ this is different from Market Demise.
**Ataylor**: Or.
**Ataylor**: What about this one?
**Njepson**: It's the same job.
**Ataylor**: Oh.

**Jdawson**: Here.
**Njepson**: One second.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Fireflies**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: So Ulta Dallas, we're rolling there.
**Njepson**: We're pretty much just waiting for them to finish up so we can call in a final inspection here in August.
**Njepson**: I got electricians finishing the lighting this week and.
**Njepson**: Yeah, that's about it.
**Ataylor**: Okay, thank you, A.J.
**Ataylor**: greatscape.
**Njepson**: I'll have to see.
**Njepson**: I'm assuming we got our final payment.
**Bclymer**: So can you check on that one?
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Njepson**: What else?
**Njepson**: Yeah, that's it for that one.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Njepson**: So, still waiting on the city of Westfield to bless it and release our bond, but that doesn't have anything to do with collected payment from them, so.
**Ataylor**: Okay, the next one of yours is.
**Jdawson**: I don't.
**Ataylor**: Which one is the next one?
**Jdawson**: A?
**Ataylor**: Neiman Holding, FedEx.

**Njepson**: Yeah, cart has a meeting with RFK Jr himself here at the end of July.
**Njepson**: And assuming all goes well, we should hopefully get a release here, I would say.
**Njepson**: What do you think, Jesse?
**Njepson**: That week or in August?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I'm sure they want us to get the equipment released.
**Bclymer**: So as soon as they have a meeting, I'm sure they'll get going.
**Njepson**: But yeah, all the subs are on board.
**Njepson**: They keep calling me asking.
**Njepson**: So what do you think, Jesse?
**Njepson**: You think I go ahead and start getting everything built out in job planner as far as contracts go or should I wait?
**Bclymer**: I mean, I would hold off just a minute because if we hire that project engineer to work on it, then he can be doing that with you.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Your next one.
**Ataylor**: Corandale.
**Fireflies**: Yep.

**Bclymer**: Okay, but I don't know what timing is.
**Bclymer**: And on the rest of the.
**Bclymer**: Does that thing go in first or.
**Bclymer**: We have to get everything else together first.
**Ataylor**: We have to get everything else to get it first.
**Ataylor**: So we need.
**Ataylor**: We need to add the affidavit.
**Ataylor**: We need to add the bond.
**Ataylor**: And then the last.

**Ataylor**: With the exams.
**Ataylor**: With the exams for the nascla, or Law and Business Exam.
**Ataylor**: Exam.
**Ataylor**: So that's the only thing.
**Ataylor**: So, yeah, once you have it, this just compile everything as usual.

**Ataylor**: Okay, so waiting AJ Churchyard out to repair.
**Njepson**: Yeah, we submitted that.
**Njepson**: So I'm not sure any feedback that Brandon got on it, but when he gets back, we can hopefully get an update.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Nick.
**Ataylor**: Goodwill storefront modifications.
**Gducharme**: We submitted a proposal to them and they're wanting a lower price.
**Gducharme**: So we're going to look at that.
**Bclymer**: So, Nick, I talked to Andrew.
**Bclymer**: I'm gonna meet him tomorrow.
**Bclymer**: We're gonna go to the Bloomington one and then Thursday we're gonna go to the other two and I'll look and I told him I'll see if there's anything possible that we could do to get it done for that.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Njepson**: Nick, what was his.
**Njepson**: What were they saying was too expensive?
**Jdawson**: The.
**Bclymer**: Like, they want to spend 18.
**Bclymer**: They want to spend 18,000 on each one.
**Njepson**: On each one.
**Bclymer**: And what were we at, 30 something?
**Bclymer**: So we basically.
**Bclymer**: If we took all our GCs out, did it for free, we could do it.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: But I just want to see if there's options.
**Bclymer**: We never really.
**Bclymer**: Jack looked at it and it just needs to I just need to take a look at it, that's all.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: This is Jesse Andres, 5 Homes, Clearwater.
**Bclymer**: He's supposed to close on this purchase of the property this week and then get his financing lined up and should be go.
**Jdawson**: Okay.

**Ataylor**: Okay, perfect.
**Ataylor**: Siba Phoenix.
**Jdawson**: Jesse, we just wait for.
**Ataylor**: We got it.
**Ataylor**: So that's done.
**Ataylor**: That was good.
**Ataylor**: And so what else is missing?
**Bclymer**: Nothing.
**Bclymer**: I don't know what, I don't know if they decided to wait and get another number or what they're doing over there, but I haven't heard from since last week.
**Bclymer**: They said they were gonna, they had to get some things in order this week.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: We have to follow up.
**Ataylor**: This is a Nick Biolab expansion.
**Gducharme**: I'm not really up to date on that project.
**Bclymer**: Me actually I still need to get an estimate.
**Bclymer**: I'm waiting on Storm to give me a rough budget.
**Bclymer**: I've got some other numbers, I just need to get them plugged in.
**Jdawson**: But I would put.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Progress in progress.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: AJ Vermilion rise building addition.
**Njepson**: Yeah, we sent our budget into them.
**Njepson**: So we'll see here.
**Bclymer**: How much does that end up being?
**Bclymer**: Like a square foot.
**Njepson**: Square foot.
**Njepson**: I was up to like 1:52 I think.
**Jdawson**: Square foot, that's pretty.
**Njepson**: Maybe even more.
**Njepson**: I mean we.
**Bclymer**: I mean that's not.
**Njepson**: Like 7,7 million dollar project for 50,000 square foot is just a concrete box.
**Bclymer**: So no interior finishes.
**Njepson**: I, well that's a separate budget.
**Njepson**: I gave him like a $2 million budget for that.
**Njepson**: So all in all I think the project was coming out to be.
**Bclymer**: I.
**Njepson**: Don'T know, 8 million, probably 9 million.
**Njepson**: But it'd be, it'd be a nice little be cool project.
**Njepson**: Do you know what they're storing in there, Jesse?
**Bclymer**: I have no clue.
**Bclymer**: What is it?
**Bclymer**: What do they do?
**Njepson**: I, I don't know.
**Njepson**: Well, it's, it's owned by some, I think they're finding a tenant and they're going to want to do this 50,000 square foot addition.
**Njepson**: Basically we're just going to build a second building and then create like a, a fire barrier tunnel in between the two.
**Njepson**: And all it is is storage.
**Njepson**: So forklifts will be coming in and out.
**Njepson**: But they want, they wanted pricing on like a four hour rated wall.
**Njepson**: I gave him pricing for like a dry system, like a nitrogen, I think, I think it's like a nitrogen wall.
**Njepson**: That's what they asked for.
**Njepson**: So it's when me and Brandon were looking up the UL listing.
**Njepson**: It's Like.
**Njepson**: Like eight layers of drywall or something.
**Bclymer**: It's crazy, but you can't have a door in it or anything else.
**Njepson**: Yeah, I don't know how.
**Njepson**: I don't know how we're gonna do it, but I guess it's just a bunch of chemicals that they're storing.
**Njepson**: So that's why we had to give them that dry fire suppression system, that nitrogen system.
**Ataylor**: Okay, and the last one.
**Ataylor**: This is Glenn.
**Ataylor**: Could we all Decatur.
**Kmass**: We haven't heard anything from Goodwill about that.
**Bclymer**: I'll ask him tomorrow when I see him.
**Kmass**: If we don't start that by Wednesday, we're not gonna be able to do it at all.
