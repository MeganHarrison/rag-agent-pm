## Transcript
**Speaker 0**: Is this your.
**Speaker 0**: Sorry.
**Speaker 0**: Not taker.
**Speaker 0**: Okay.
**Speaker 0**: Yes.
**Speaker 0**: Existing warehouse is 50,000 square feet.
**Speaker 0**: Three poured concrete sides and one knockout side.
**Speaker 0**: Because they expand, it's.
**Speaker 0**: The floor is not poured.
**Speaker 0**: There's three dock doors in it.
**Speaker 0**: The.
**Speaker 0**: The most unattractive thing is on that side.
**Speaker 0**: Or the rainwater collection actually comes into the building, gets routed.
**Speaker 0**: They want gutters, not rainwaters.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, we don't want any water.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, we don't want any water.
**Speaker 0**: Especially in the building we're going to build.
**Speaker 0**: So we'll just.
**Speaker 0**: We're going to slip it one way and gun off the back end.
**Speaker 0**: So that's part of the.
**Speaker 0**: Is to re reaper insulation now.
**Speaker 0**: So.
**Speaker 0**: So the other the existing facility will make the manufacturing side.
**Speaker 0**: The risk would be less than.
**Speaker 0**: Than our storage warehouse.
**Speaker 0**: We have millions of pounds of the new Z1TPO sleepwood slope.
**Speaker 0**: But we will want a real estimate.
**Speaker 0**: I don't know if I talked to you about it.
**Speaker 0**: Someone threw out somewhere in the 3, $400,000 range that we sealed the roof.
**Speaker 0**: We'd like a real estimate to do that.
**Speaker 0**: We can.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: I've talked to people along the way.
**Speaker 0**: He's waiting.
**Speaker 0**: Hey, Kevin, you there?
**Speaker 1**: Hey, Mark.
**Speaker 1**: Yes, I'm here.
**Speaker 0**: Hey.
**Speaker 0**: Good.
**Speaker 0**: Hey, how are you?
**Speaker 0**: Good.
**Speaker 1**: How are you?
**Speaker 0**: Good.
**Speaker 0**: We're just about to get started.
**Speaker 0**: I understand Ben's going to come a little later.
**Speaker 1**: I believe so.
**Speaker 1**: Yes.
**Speaker 0**: Well, we'll get started.
**Speaker 0**: We're just talking about the existing shell, what features it had.
**Speaker 0**: We're talking about the rainwater collection inside and getting a hard estimate of free slope in the roof and putting gutter on one side as a.
**Speaker 0**: As a potential alternative or potential upgrade.
**Speaker 0**: Okay.
**Speaker 0**: Other than that, there was some parking on the outside.
**Speaker 0**: I think if it could expand.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: It was already on in the plans.
**Speaker 0**: It was already accounted for.
**Speaker 0**: Future.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: Just to put it in.
**Speaker 0**: See other than that it's pretty non descript.
**Speaker 0**: It's a nice building.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: Front office area.
**Speaker 0**: Nice glass.
**Speaker 0**: Or take advantage of that from an aesthetics standpoint.
**Speaker 0**: But in general it's a shell.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: Well built shell.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: Biggest thing is going to be, you know, the whatever equipment.
**Speaker 0**: Right.
**Speaker 0**: Power sources.
**Speaker 0**: Like what?
**Speaker 0**: Whatever that requires based on your machinery and then you know, whatever changes are you required, you know, for the sprinkler.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: So two kind of big things.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: So power wise we have a.
**Speaker 0**: We have an upper bound estimate.
**Speaker 0**: 1200amps.
**Speaker 0**: Right.
**Speaker 0**: I don't think we'll come nearly that high, but we're planning around that.
**Speaker 0**: We'll.
**Speaker 0**: We'll come in something Less than that.
**Speaker 0**: I think that's what you already had in there.
**Speaker 0**: I think I was in my.
**Speaker 0**: In my write off.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: Am I right?
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, I think we're talking about it.
**Speaker 0**: Is there any existing documents?
**Speaker 0**: No, there's a. Kevin, you remember, is there a H U in there?
**Speaker 1**: Is there a what A heating.
**Speaker 0**: A heating unit in there?
**Speaker 0**: There might be, yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, there's.
**Speaker 1**: There's a unit sitting in that back corner.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, it's natural gas, I believe.
**Speaker 1**: A rapid unit sit in the back corner.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: Resin or heater or some.
**Speaker 1**: I think it's a.
**Speaker 1**: It's an actual rapid unit.
**Speaker 0**: Oh, okay.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, there's your.
**Speaker 0**: You know, back here.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: I think the show was built with 17.
**Speaker 1**: Yes.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: It's a really interesting thing.
**Speaker 0**: The park is.
**Speaker 0**: It's the former DoD site reclaimed.
**Speaker 0**: The VX nerve agent production storage site reclaimed.
**Speaker 0**: This is actually outside the fence, right outside the main gate.
**Speaker 0**: But it's a what they call mega park.
**Speaker 0**: There's only six or seven tenants in.
**Speaker 0**: It was created by the Indiana government as a industrial mega park.
**Speaker 0**: And this hasn't got a lot, a lot of traction now.
**Speaker 0**: There are some pretty big things going on.
**Speaker 0**: There's big power potential power generation there and data center.
**Speaker 0**: Say I am teamed up with the power.
**Speaker 0**: Because you can't have a data center if you don't have power plant.
**Speaker 0**: Yes, power.
**Speaker 0**: So there's some of that planning going on.
**Speaker 0**: I don't know that anything's been triggered and pulled yet, but that would not surprise me if that actually comes to fruition there.
**Speaker 0**: Are there any temperature requirements of the building?
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: So it's 70 degrees F, 70% relative humidity controlled inside out.
**Speaker 0**: Both the shell and the expansion.
**Speaker 0**: Assume you had that in your.
**Speaker 0**: In your estimate there, Right?
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, I mean we, we did see here 4.5 tons.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: So we've got the capacity for the new building and then 100%.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, yeah.
**Speaker 0**: And then the existing.
**Speaker 0**: That's where we just did.
**Speaker 0**: You don't have a square foot number for your budget for that 1.7.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: That need to be the same.
**Speaker 0**: Essentially the same thing.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, it'll be.
**Speaker 0**: I would think again.
**Speaker 0**: And we just have to understand, you know, because you're like what's the load per person?
**Speaker 0**: Right.
**Speaker 0**: Heat load, you know, so how many people are going to be.
**Speaker 0**: I would think more people would be manufacturing than in the warehouse.
**Speaker 0**: And then you know again, your equipment is going to have an off put of heat.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, there's.
**Speaker 0**: Those are just calculations.
**Speaker 0**: 32 total people say six of them be in the Warehouse in the existing.
**Speaker 0**: And then in the, in the expanded tension, it would be six.
**Speaker 0**: Okay.
**Speaker 0**: That's what we call the warehouse and manufacturing go in the existing shell.
**Speaker 0**: But it's, it's the air changes or dust collection.
**Speaker 0**: Things like that are probably more impactful than the number of bodies.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: I mean, so it just depends on what you guys need.
**Speaker 0**: If you need an air change every hour, every 15 minutes, every, you know, one twice an tomorrow, I guess.
**Speaker 0**: You know what, Kevin?
**Speaker 0**: What do you do?
**Speaker 0**: You guys, what do you have it.
**Speaker 1**: You know, you know, I. I think our.
**Speaker 1**: Our rule of thumb here is four to seven air changes.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: And what.
**Speaker 1**: I didn't, I didn't hear what you presented.
**Speaker 1**: I guess I don't know what you have in front of you that we're reviewing right now.
**Speaker 1**: Did you have a.
**Speaker 0**: Let me share my screen.
**Speaker 0**: I just have the little document that I wrote up.
**Speaker 0**: I think you have that, Kevin, but he's, he's going to show it.
**Speaker 0**: So this.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, this is just all we were going through.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: Okay, so you need, you know, so basically you need an air change every 10 minutes.
**Speaker 0**: Yes.
**Speaker 0**: Okay.
**Speaker 0**: Both the links.
**Speaker 1**: Yes.
**Speaker 0**: You know that smell like in a pool or whatever, you get chlorine.
**Speaker 0**: So.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, that builds up two things.
**Speaker 0**: Well, obviously it's not comfortable for people, but also it.
**Speaker 0**: The higher chlorine content promotes corrosion.
**Speaker 0**: And so especially if it's humid, water chlorine don't go well with steel.
**Speaker 0**: So.
**Speaker 0**: So anyway, I. I don't know how you want to go through this.
**Speaker 0**: Well, I mean, you know, we can kind of walk through, you know, what questions you guys have on everything.
**Speaker 0**: Well, my biggest thing I want to make sure.
**Speaker 0**: Covered what we think you've covered.
**Speaker 0**: Okay.
**Speaker 0**: Just what's in that document?
**Speaker 0**: Got a layout.
**Speaker 0**: I'll send you the layout if I have the version like this.
**Speaker 0**: No, there was a.
**Speaker 0**: There's an equipment layout that we did this one.
**Speaker 0**: As time goes on, I've put more and more detail to how things will be laid out.
**Speaker 0**: I don't think we ever.
**Speaker 0**: I'll get back to you here in a second, but I can, I can pull that up and show you.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, I mean, you know, you know, basically, so, you know, kind of what we pulled together.
**Speaker 0**: Right.
**Speaker 0**: So all these clarifications, you know, are for the.
**Speaker 0**: Your build expansion, right?
**Speaker 0**: Well, they're both in here, so.
**Speaker 0**: No, I'm talking about in the sheet in front of you.
**Speaker 0**: Right.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: So all these clarifications pertain to, you know, the added building and then the alternates Listed at the bottom.
**Speaker 0**: That's where we gave you basically your budget for the existing building modifications.
**Speaker 0**: And then you know, I think you'd asked us to include a you know, budget to 1 to 255 wall fee.
**Speaker 0**: You know, things like, you know, like an interchange every 10 minutes.
**Speaker 0**: You know we, I don't, we don't have, I don't even have the equivalent to that.
**Speaker 0**: Not to say that it can't just be changed.
**Speaker 0**: Right, gotcha.
**Speaker 0**: That's kind of why we want to have this discussion next week.
**Speaker 0**: Get first stuff up actually first time the number of air changes came up.
**Speaker 0**: Discussion.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So we, you know we, we have air makeup units mostly all rapid units up here.
**Speaker 1**: And the thing, the thing that we don't you up here is climate control.
**Speaker 1**: So that's going to be a, that's going to be the, the huge differences capability of cooling.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Speaker 1**: So you know with air makeup units you can, you can make those changes a lot easier.
**Speaker 1**: But with climate control it's a whole different animal.
**Speaker 0**: So you know, typically what you see in this area is you look for you know, 70 degrees on 100 degree day average.
**Speaker 0**: You know that's basically for this area.
**Speaker 0**: Is that what you guys look for on your temperature control or do you have a metric that you look at.
**Speaker 0**: Well, 70 on 100 seems to be reasonable.
**Speaker 0**: You're not going to have much higher than 100.
**Speaker 0**: Right.
**Speaker 0**: For very unusual.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: So yeah, that seems to cover me.
**Speaker 0**: Cover it.
**Speaker 0**: But the 90, 70% RH maintained value.
**Speaker 0**: That's more important than.
**Speaker 0**: So if it was.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: A few degrees higher.
**Speaker 0**: But we control the humidity.
**Speaker 0**: Okay.
**Speaker 0**: That's.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: Now we definitely just need to look at the size of the unit to handle 100% outside air with.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: Provide them for air changes.
**Speaker 0**: SP original spec building here.
**Speaker 0**: Okay.
**Speaker 0**: And then the warehouse of the 50,000 square foot warehouse here connected to some tunnels.
**Speaker 0**: Two tunnels.
**Speaker 0**: The people we talk to suggest to be 15, 20ft apart to be able to get equipment in between.
**Speaker 0**: When you're building the.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, the buildings.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yes.
**Speaker 0**: That way we can.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah it's, it's fine for us.
**Speaker 0**: As soon as you have three, four or five feet that you have the fire break.
**Speaker 0**: But further is fine.
**Speaker 0**: And so let's go through the expansion.
**Speaker 0**: It's easier to talk about here.
**Speaker 0**: Got.
**Speaker 0**: It's got three dock doors here, a roll up door over here and it's divided into four sections.
**Speaker 0**: Two different raw material sections.
**Speaker 0**: Fire do.
**Speaker 0**: It's actually going to be a fire door there and this one's going to be here, but still.
**Speaker 0**: And there'll be three fire doors here that normally opens.
**Speaker 0**: Of course if fire is detected, then these will cause.
**Speaker 0**: Isolate these.
**Speaker 0**: This, this will be open like this.
**Speaker 0**: Well, we, we will have a firewall here, but it will go all the way across.
**Speaker 0**: It'll be a kind of a fire break.
**Speaker 0**: And it's not a requirement to have firewall.
**Speaker 0**: It's just there are two types of finished goods, two different chemicals.
**Speaker 0**: Once they're in packaging, they're quite stable.
**Speaker 0**: They go on shelves right next to each other or whatever.
**Speaker 0**: We just a little bit added protection to have an isolation there.
**Speaker 0**: I can sense there is some reactive nature between the two chemicals.
**Speaker 0**: So firewall, Firewall, Firewall.
**Speaker 0**: Basically everything else is just racking.
**Speaker 0**: In an open warehouse.
**Speaker 0**: Do you set interacts for these or do you know what type do you said interacts for this stuff?
**Speaker 0**: What's the hazardous classification interaction?
**Speaker 0**: Yes.
**Speaker 0**: Okay, so then you'll probably do type A protection scheme.
**Speaker 0**: Scheme A. I'm not sure what scheme is.
**Speaker 0**: That's typical.
**Speaker 0**: It's a hazardous.
**Speaker 0**: Right.
**Speaker 0**: Type one.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, your stuff.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: So scheme a just per NFPA 13 is just the, it's the layout of the head.
**Speaker 0**: So what you'll do is you'll have, you know, it'll crisscross heads all the way down and then you'll have a level of plywood every two levels.
**Speaker 0**: Okay.
**Speaker 0**: So I don't know how tall that racking is, but if it's, let's say it's 16 foot, right.
**Speaker 0**: These will be 5 high here.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So roughly 20 foot tall racking.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: And here it's too high because of the class of oxidizer and three high here.
**Speaker 0**: Okay.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: So then you'll have to have, you know, every two levels you have to have a ceiling and then a level Dirac here is the overhead door and a pad basically with a small little containment in sump area.
**Speaker 0**: So if we have a decomping super sac, we want to get it out of the building because it's creating chlorine gas and take it out of here, put it in this little containment area, you know, maybe a six inch curve around, set it in and hose it off.
**Speaker 0**: Just basically just dissolve it.
**Speaker 0**: And that would go into some.
**Speaker 0**: That would pump back into the super system or back into the chemical treatment system.
**Speaker 0**: Make sense?
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, that's just a little bit.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: And as an alternative or not alternative.
**Speaker 0**: In addition, we're.
**Speaker 0**: We're going to consider putting one over here on this side too.
**Speaker 0**: I don't know the likelihood or not.
**Speaker 0**: But yeah.
**Speaker 0**: So we would have to add the door there.
**Speaker 0**: I'll update that description that narrative a couple options to quote on re slogan and they will form these additional.
**Speaker 0**: This particular pad and associated door.
**Speaker 0**: Other things noteworthy on this side there's not.
**Speaker 0**: So is you mentioned you wanted a four hour wall.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: Is there a reason or why four hours?
**Speaker 0**: Why not a code drive too.
**Speaker 0**: But it's.
**Speaker 0**: It's purely risk redemption.
**Speaker 0**: So the.
**Speaker 0**: The panels are only rated for three.
**Speaker 0**: The concrete panels.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: So I would encourage you to downgrade them to three because it's porous over.
**Speaker 0**: I would say overkill that.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, yeah.
**Speaker 0**: You know I'll send you this.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, yeah.
**Speaker 0**: Because that'll help us a lot.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: Do you care about the spec on the overhead doors for those openings forward here, the rated ones and yeah, three R walls do I care about.
**Speaker 0**: I mean I don't know if there's a company you guys use a certain type.
**Speaker 0**: Kevin, I don't know that you have a particular fire door that you guys have specified or not.
**Speaker 1**: I mean we locally work with overhead.
**Speaker 0**: Door company so yeah.
**Speaker 0**: So basically.
**Speaker 0**: Okay, well if they're coming down they're probably going to be a motorized.
**Speaker 0**: No.
**Speaker 0**: What us does open all the time.
**Speaker 0**: These are open all the time.
**Speaker 0**: Unless there's a well.
**Speaker 0**: Do you want to control it?
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, you want to know because you want to pre.
**Speaker 0**: Like if it pre acts right.
**Speaker 0**: If you have 10 so it will still have a fusible link, right?
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: So as far as like you know on this.
**Speaker 0**: This warehouse.
**Speaker 0**: We're going to help them do the warehouse side.
**Speaker 0**: Do you guys have any requirements or anything as far as like glass, like clear story windows or anything like that.
**Speaker 0**: Or skylights safety.
**Speaker 0**: Yep, safety.
**Speaker 0**: Over.
**Speaker 0**: Over cover.
**Speaker 0**: And really the air conditioner is again all about safety.
**Speaker 0**: Not really about.
**Speaker 0**: And you put any.
**Speaker 0**: You know, since water is such a big deal.
**Speaker 0**: Do you have any or look at any kind of moisture detection systems to put up at the roof deck, you know, to detect if there's a small leak or something.
**Speaker 0**: So that's something that we'll talk about here.
**Speaker 0**: Over here the leaks tend to come from really what you can get rainwater leaks.
**Speaker 0**: But where they come from and where they go you have sensors everywhere.
**Speaker 0**: That's challenging.
**Speaker 0**: So sprinklers over time they leak which is why we want the dry astronaut and then on the other side the rainwater collection inside.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, rainwater.
**Speaker 0**: As an alternative, we've thought about just putting a trough under all of them and just have a little leak sensors around there.
**Speaker 0**: But in general, finding that one rainwater leak in the roof is really, really difficult.
**Speaker 0**: And it's more of a cultural thing.
**Speaker 0**: It's like using water.
**Speaker 0**: We stop, we dress it right then and there.
**Speaker 0**: Something to look at and it's more.
**Speaker 0**: As a plant ages, it's obviously more problematic.
**Speaker 0**: Well, cogs are your biggest thing.
**Speaker 0**: Right.
**Speaker 0**: Especially when you have crickets like your existing one because it pools on top.
**Speaker 0**: Everything's sloped in and so you know, then you.
**Speaker 0**: That's where you now on this side.
**Speaker 0**: The volume of material that's actually in the in plant over here is quite small.
**Speaker 0**: It's only what you're processing in the machines at the time.
**Speaker 0**: You know, maybe a couple of super stacks lined up and there's people around them.
**Speaker 0**: So the risk there is for a number of reasons much less than sitting in a warehouse over the course of a week.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, you have that issue.
**Speaker 0**: Right.
**Speaker 0**: So.
**Speaker 0**: But, but yeah, it's still, it's still, still risk.
**Speaker 0**: I don't know how to get rid of that risk.
**Speaker 0**: You can put sensors, but there's not something to catch it and divert it to one place to.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: To invalidate.
**Speaker 0**: It's very difficult to find that.
**Speaker 0**: But I'm super interested if you guys have a. Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: Mostly it's a fluted deck.
**Speaker 0**: So that water will just get in there and then it just runs to.
**Speaker 0**: It's to that like one end and then you, you have a trough that captures it all and you could tell.
**Speaker 0**: Well, I mean you could put them in just spaced out in a general way and it's not going to catch everything like you say.
**Speaker 0**: No, definitely, definitely interested as an I.
**Speaker 0**: What is that?
**Speaker 0**: What does that cost benefit trade off?
**Speaker 0**: Is it a super expensive thing or is it.
**Speaker 0**: It's not too bad because the deck's already fluted and you're.
**Speaker 0**: You're gonna.
**Speaker 0**: Moisture leak detection system like what you're talking about based off of the amount of damage water does it.
**Speaker 0**: You know, again it's not going to be cost prohibitive.
**Speaker 0**: It's, you know, you're talking less, you know, equal to what a firearm is almost, you know, since you show what it is.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, yeah.
**Speaker 0**: I mean if it's.
**Speaker 0**: If the costs are in that.
**Speaker 0**: Right.
**Speaker 0**: Then we definitely.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: It's up to explore and you guys make a business decision.
**Speaker 0**: Yep.
**Speaker 0**: But making a multi deck situation, which I've done in the past for I did it for a tower will be built for pretty soon.
**Speaker 0**: I mean if you're, if you were that.
**Speaker 0**: If you were that concerned, I would almost Say to do closed cell spray foam on the bottom of the deck or some sort of.
**Speaker 0**: So it's got to be something that actually doesn't just hide it or spread it out.
**Speaker 0**: I'd rather have it come through a pool and know about that way than kind of hide in there.
**Speaker 0**: But it's the concept of going into a fluted, you know, deck and then running to a collection spot that.
**Speaker 0**: That's got some.
**Speaker 0**: And then as far as the spec on your roof membrane, we could with the inspect a higher middle.
**Speaker 0**: So it's like a 20.
**Speaker 0**: You can do 30.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: Or 60.
**Speaker 0**: I mean.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, yeah.
**Speaker 0**: So optioning that out is going to be interesting as well.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, yeah.
**Speaker 0**: That's.
**Speaker 0**: I'd say that's probably the biggest thing is knowing that you'd want to go a 60 mil roof hails here.
**Speaker 0**: Other than that I don't know what else would damage the root monastery.
**Speaker 0**: Well up there the wind.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: Where they're at, it's pretty windy.
**Speaker 0**: I'm from Florida, so.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: Just flat.
**Speaker 0**: Nothing to break it up.
**Speaker 0**: Exactly.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: But yeah that's the.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, I'd say definitely want to do a 60 mil roof.
**Speaker 0**: That thicker membrane will pay dividends for.
**Speaker 0**: You know that's not aloha in the picture things.
**Speaker 0**: The roof, it's got everything else to it.
**Speaker 0**: So.
**Speaker 0**: Yep.
**Speaker 0**: Okay down here.
**Speaker 0**: Roger.
**Speaker 0**: Room for this building.
**Speaker 0**: Other than that there's not much in this building.
**Speaker 0**: So they wanted a roof access.
**Speaker 0**: So you'll have to have a switchback ladder.
**Speaker 0**: It'll take up a little like where would that go in this warehouse?
**Speaker 0**: Just talk about the liner and cage by the riser.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: It doesn't really matter.
**Speaker 0**: Or do you want it on the outside?
**Speaker 0**: Is there anything else to put it inside?
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: So people.
**Speaker 0**: Can't people access the top of their building?
**Speaker 0**: Or we could put a letter K. Like just the locking door.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: I don't know what you're.
**Speaker 0**: Again what your guys is it's so remote like the.
**Speaker 0**: The risk from you know the outside public.
**Speaker 0**: That's the best way to do it.
**Speaker 0**: So exterior ladder access.
**Speaker 0**: I'm not.
**Speaker 0**: Not overly concerned but random people getting in on the roof and Hillsdale.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So around here we have exterior roof access.
**Speaker 1**: Couple of points inside.
**Speaker 1**: But outside the ones just have the.
**Speaker 1**: The cage in the bottom with a.
**Speaker 1**: With a lock.
**Speaker 0**: So that's fine.
**Speaker 0**: And you guys are right.
**Speaker 0**: Pretty substantial urban area.
**Speaker 1**: So yeah.
**Speaker 1**: There's one inside the building marks that I don't know if you showed that in your production drawing.
**Speaker 1**: There's one in that back corner where the.
**Speaker 1**: Where that rapid H Vac unit is, which would be in your.
**Speaker 1**: Where your powder blending is.
**Speaker 0**: There is one right now.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, it's standard in the warehouse.
**Speaker 1**: I'm sorry.
**Speaker 1**: No, the left side, bottom left.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, yeah.
**Speaker 0**: In this corner.
**Speaker 0**: Nope.
**Speaker 0**: Up top left of the top left.
**Speaker 1**: I'm sorry.
**Speaker 0**: Other bottom left.
**Speaker 1**: So there's.
**Speaker 1**: There's the.
**Speaker 1**: The H Vac unit is back there along with interior roof ladder.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: So the H Vac would probably have to get rid of cad.
**Speaker 0**: And there's already.
**Speaker 0**: There'll be a mezzanine here.
**Speaker 0**: We just have to go from that mezzanine up to the.
**Speaker 1**: Yep.
**Speaker 0**: So that's fine too.
**Speaker 0**: If we can, you know, wherever you're storing this stuff, then we can just strategically locate the new rooftop unit.
**Speaker 0**: So they're over all like a corridor area.
**Speaker 0**: They wouldn't be underwater material.
**Speaker 0**: Do you have to perimeter ground routing or.
**Speaker 0**: You could.
**Speaker 0**: But I would do.
**Speaker 0**: I would probably do roof.
**Speaker 0**: Especially if you think about re.
**Speaker 0**: Roofing it.
**Speaker 0**: Just because if you're gonna do ground mounted, then.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, you're gonna.
**Speaker 0**: You gotta duck a long way or go up and you go up and through the sidewall.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: Eliminate.
**Speaker 0**: Then you could eliminate all.
**Speaker 0**: That's the.
**Speaker 0**: There's some advantage to that from a standpoint.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: So.
**Speaker 1**: Mark over here.
**Speaker 1**: Typically at our facilities in Grand Rapids, we have exterior ground mounted rapid units with penetrations in the side of the building.
**Speaker 1**: And a couple of our instances we have.
**Speaker 1**: We have a couple areas where they're on the roof and we'll run duck socks for disperse there.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, yeah.
**Speaker 0**: I mean.
**Speaker 0**: So your preference is ground mountain.
**Speaker 1**: I would say.
**Speaker 1**: I would say so, yes.
**Speaker 1**: Just because of accessibility.
**Speaker 1**: With that being said, you know, obviously there's going to be probably after four.
**Speaker 1**: Pour a pad and.
**Speaker 0**: For both of them.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, yeah.
**Speaker 0**: Because like the.
**Speaker 0**: And most of the roof leaks are from the workers installing the stuff on the roof.
**Speaker 1**: Correct.
**Speaker 0**: With their screws and stuff going around.
**Speaker 0**: So if we can just eliminate people from behind the roof.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: We don't have any roof drains.
**Speaker 0**: Like now you've got nothing.
**Speaker 0**: But a strong roof is gonna love you, kid.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: How many.
**Speaker 0**: How many penetration?
**Speaker 0**: None.
**Speaker 0**: How many what part?
**Speaker 0**: None.
**Speaker 0**: Do you understand?
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: And then your wet stack will be above the bathroom.
**Speaker 0**: So.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: Bounce it out other than a vent.
**Speaker 0**: You'll see that it's above the bathroom area.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: You have nothing in your warehouse?
**Speaker 0**: Oh, God.
**Speaker 0**: Well, no.
**Speaker 0**: Let's go straight up.
**Speaker 0**: Okay.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: The warehouse itself should have nothing.
**Speaker 0**: I don't know if you need One in the riser room or not.
**Speaker 0**: But yeah, yeah.
**Speaker 0**: And then, and then over here, your bathrooms and stuff are over here.
**Speaker 0**: Sewering lights over here.
**Speaker 0**: So purposely away from production.
**Speaker 0**: So.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: And then any of these interior walls in here in your existing space.
**Speaker 0**: These are just non rated.
**Speaker 0**: No, these are, these are fire rated.
**Speaker 0**: Okay, so that was also in the document.
**Speaker 0**: I had those as two hours, but in three hours just do another layer of kitchen on it.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, basically.
**Speaker 0**: So two hours, two on each side.
**Speaker 0**: Three is three, five, eight.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: So why don't you cost both a two and a three out there?
**Speaker 0**: It should be easy enough to do.
**Speaker 0**: Right?
**Speaker 0**: All right, so I'll kind of go through the quitting layout here, details about our equipment.
**Speaker 0**: But this is a segregated room with a fire door.
**Speaker 0**: Two or three hours.
**Speaker 0**: Firewall.
**Speaker 0**: Same thing here is a firewall around this space.
**Speaker 0**: And fire door there.
**Speaker 0**: What are those?
**Speaker 0**: Right.
**Speaker 0**: Those four doors are out to the left.
**Speaker 0**: Say again?
**Speaker 0**: The left a little bit.
**Speaker 0**: It's got those four doors.
**Speaker 0**: Level sample.
**Speaker 0**: And it's just like rooms or what?
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, these are, these are, these are rooms.
**Speaker 0**: These are like an area for dust collection.
**Speaker 0**: Have a drive and controls room that.
**Speaker 0**: This was in that narrative.
**Speaker 0**: The spaces, you know, label and sample storage or QC lab.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: I assume I can replace it.
**Speaker 0**: That's like a drywall room or these cages.
**Speaker 0**: Drywall room.
**Speaker 0**: Well, the firewall goes here.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, it is.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: What's it say?
**Speaker 0**: Kiting.
**Speaker 0**: Kitting.
**Speaker 0**: It's just where they'll package stuff up.
**Speaker 0**: And this part, this part is not fire rated.
**Speaker 0**: Over here it's just the fire rating.
**Speaker 0**: Fire isolation is here.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, they're on the back and there.
**Speaker 0**: And then over here it's just packaging supplies.
**Speaker 0**: So normal fire risk associated with that.
**Speaker 0**: They're segregated.
**Speaker 0**: Because you get them together is even more problematic.
**Speaker 0**: So you don't want to intermix the oxidizer with materials that are combustible.
**Speaker 0**: Do you guys ever do any kind of emergency ventilation?
**Speaker 0**: No, I don't.
**Speaker 0**: What's that, like a smoke evac system?
**Speaker 0**: I don't think they have that capability in any of your facilities, do you, Kevin?
**Speaker 0**: No, no.
**Speaker 0**: I mean what it turns out to be is if you have one or two super sacs involved, you get them out of the building, you put SCVs A's and you go.
**Speaker 0**: If you, if you're there problems, if it happens over a weekend or whatever, you get a pretty fully engulfed fire.
**Speaker 0**: You're just watching it or what.
**Speaker 0**: The history has been, it's been incredibly difficult to fight.
**Speaker 0**: And you, you guys Are just working standard, you know, five days a week, whatever.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: So this will be four, you know, four.
**Speaker 0**: Four or five day.
**Speaker 0**: Probably four times a week.
**Speaker 0**: So there's a lot of time.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: Downtime.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: Thermal cameras up and do things to manage their risk.
**Speaker 0**: But yeah, it's definitely risk there.
**Speaker 0**: So just good design, good housekeeping, taking care of roof leaks when you.
**Speaker 0**: When you see them.
**Speaker 0**: You know, that kind of stuff makes a difference.
**Speaker 0**: You guys don't have any need for backup generation?
**Speaker 0**: No.
**Speaker 1**: We have backup generation up here for our server needs for it.
**Speaker 0**: Little small.
**Speaker 0**: What size backup?
**Speaker 1**: I think we have.
**Speaker 0**: You're running the business off one of them.
**Speaker 1**: I think one of them's like a 50k unit because it runs one of our air makeup units along with it.
**Speaker 1**: But typically, like at our, I don't know, a couple of the other areas, it's just for it backup.
**Speaker 0**: Like generator or just battery backup generator, like 20kW generator.
**Speaker 0**: Like.
**Speaker 1**: One'S.
**Speaker 0**: One's.
**Speaker 1**: One's like a 25kW.
**Speaker 1**: And I think the bigger one is a.
**Speaker 1**: Is a 40 or 50 kilowatts because it.
**Speaker 1**: It keeps one of the air makeup units.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: Going.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, probably.
**Speaker 0**: We have fairly small IT footprint.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, I would say, you know, 25.
**Speaker 0**: Is there an IT room on here?
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, yeah, there's.
**Speaker 0**: It's not drawn here.
**Speaker 0**: I'll get to office space stuff.
**Speaker 0**: But there's.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So at our, like at our use facility, Mark, it runs IT room and then like interior office power, like to workstations, customer service office, employees to keep.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: So you could keep.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, but this plant wouldn't.
**Speaker 0**: It would just keep the server up.
**Speaker 0**: Right.
**Speaker 0**: I mean it just.
**Speaker 0**: So for the code just to be able to back it back up and, and then properly power down.
**Speaker 0**: It's like if you back up the power to a workstation, then you got to back up the lights because like it's all tied together here, basically.
**Speaker 0**: So.
**Speaker 0**: Because they're saying, well, if you're in there and your computer's still on and.
**Speaker 0**: But yeah, it's just in that space, right?
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, just that space would be something size for the office area, basically.
**Speaker 0**: For the whole office or just for the IT room.
**Speaker 0**: Like.
**Speaker 0**: Like, I don't know that you're talking 50K.
**Speaker 0**: Debbie would handle the mobile office because you're only talking.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, that's a.
**Speaker 1**: It's a point we can talk about, Mark.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: It's not small piece.
**Speaker 1**: So.
**Speaker 0**: Because the power goes down, the plant, the plants down, it's very different than like Power at the office there where you have.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: I would think the only thing you would want is backup for essentially your sigil thing.
**Speaker 0**: So like for instance all your like thermal cameras and everything and then IP whatever the hell is.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, I don't think we have no, we don't.
**Speaker 0**: Cord somewhere.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: All right.
**Speaker 0**: So a quick 25 to 50 question mark generator to have to see what Kevin.
**Speaker 0**: What.
**Speaker 0**: What our intentions are.
**Speaker 0**: But seems to me that.
**Speaker 0**: That the point of that is just to get it powered down in a safe state.
**Speaker 0**: Not to be able to continue.
**Speaker 1**: I agree.
**Speaker 0**: Anybody doing their job, you know, from the standpoint of it.
**Speaker 0**: Because you would not going to have any personnel like order takers or anything like that.
**Speaker 0**: Okay, but that's a good point.
**Speaker 0**: Grab a light up four and a half.
**Speaker 0**: Sounds great.
**Speaker 0**: So then down here got mechanical room, electrical valve where you have to make switch gear disconnect.
**Speaker 0**: We want these in their own enclosed rooms.
**Speaker 0**: These could be combined.
**Speaker 0**: But to have their own little H vac unit and isolated.
**Speaker 0**: One of the bigger damage mechanisms is if you have chlorine smoker super sac.
**Speaker 0**: The first thing it attacks is copper contacts, PLC gear, that kind of stuff.
**Speaker 0**: So try to isolate that as best possible for.
**Speaker 0**: And we got the shipping receiving office there a little.
**Speaker 0**: This would be like a caged area or just segregated area for fork truck charging.
**Speaker 0**: Do you know what kind of chargers you have?
**Speaker 0**: Don't.
**Speaker 0**: Electric.
**Speaker 0**: Electric.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, electric.
**Speaker 0**: And we have a little area strip bottle on and bucket labeling lines a little quicker.
**Speaker 0**: So they did.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: So hopefully for a full term charger.
**Speaker 0**: I don't think so.
**Speaker 0**: Nothing existing.
**Speaker 0**: I. I had in a different part of our budget I had set aside.
**Speaker 0**: So we.
**Speaker 0**: So when we.
**Speaker 0**: We didn't have this layout or anything we like.
**Speaker 0**: So whenever we looked at this basically like we.
**Speaker 0**: We had the existing drawings and so we put together budget for the new building clarification certificate.
**Speaker 0**: That's pretty straightforward.
**Speaker 0**: And then we put a basically square foot number on the improvements.
**Speaker 0**: So now with this we'll be able to go back and actually break it out.
**Speaker 0**: You know like some of this was in that narrative though.
**Speaker 0**: The rooms with you know block wall room with an H vac.
**Speaker 0**: I assume you can account for those.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, I mean again what we as we said like the biggest thing we could do in that time frame, you know to turn around was basically just put a good square foot number on what it would be to build out a traditional space, which is what we did.
**Speaker 0**: So you know.
**Speaker 0**: And it's the.
**Speaker 0**: The Inrex frankly that Brian was talking about versus you know, we just have fire suppression for the inside of the warehouse.
**Speaker 0**: Is that something also that you want him to.
**Speaker 0**: Well yeah.
**Speaker 0**: We price it.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah yeah.
**Speaker 0**: Like linear heat detection for the pre hack.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: So you'll have obviously your.
**Speaker 0**: Your storage thing for all your hazardous chemicals.
**Speaker 0**: What you're storing where or whatever that that is.
**Speaker 0**: And then I'm almost certain it'll be a scheme a for your Iraq.
**Speaker 0**: We do.
**Speaker 0**: So we.
**Speaker 0**: We have our.
**Speaker 0**: We have a in house division for sprinkler.
**Speaker 0**: So we do A lot of the reason.
**Speaker 0**: The only reason I know so much about Interact is because we specifically just do in rack sprinklers for warehouses all over the country.
**Speaker 0**: But not just general.
**Speaker 0**: No.
**Speaker 0**: Like if we wouldn't like our office.
**Speaker 0**: We didn't do it like we don't do like actual regular sprinklers do high end just simple like strictly.
**Speaker 0**: Yes.
**Speaker 0**: Like ASRs and interact stuff.
**Speaker 0**: And we've got a little chemical treatment curved in area that was also on the list.
**Speaker 0**: We'll put a couple tanks, you know, treatment tanks.
**Speaker 0**: Four drain.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: That'll connect to the.
**Speaker 0**: The sewer system here.
**Speaker 0**: Okay.
**Speaker 0**: And I don't.
**Speaker 0**: It might just be pumped over and come through.
**Speaker 0**: Not just like go into the controlled.
**Speaker 0**: Not just draining.
**Speaker 0**: There'll probably be a floor drain in the.
**Speaker 0**: In the sump area.
**Speaker 0**: But it needs to be controlled as well.
**Speaker 0**: Right.
**Speaker 0**: It's got to have a valve on it.
**Speaker 0**: Not just go.
**Speaker 0**: It hits the floor.
**Speaker 0**: It's going in the sewer.
**Speaker 0**: We want to control it there.
**Speaker 0**: Gotcha.
**Speaker 0**: The office space mezzanine dub to levels maintenance cage area here.
**Speaker 0**: And the rest of it is the equipment area around the firefight.
**Speaker 0**: Okay.
**Speaker 0**: And do you have for all your equipment area and everything do you have a list of what takes what power 480?
**Speaker 0**: Not.
**Speaker 0**: Not yet.
**Speaker 0**: We will produce a distribution list.
**Speaker 0**: Don't have it.
**Speaker 0**: Right.
**Speaker 0**: Right now I could give you an assumed number of drops for the 1200amps, something like that.
**Speaker 0**: But yeah, I mean like just knowing if like for instance, you know, is that 480.
**Speaker 0**: Is that most of it's going to be 480.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: Okay.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: The filler machines and stuff that you've been getting Kevin, are those 480 or 240 or could be either.
**Speaker 1**: Filler machines are.
**Speaker 1**: They can be either.
**Speaker 1**: But 480.
**Speaker 1**: The palletizers will be 220.
**Speaker 0**: 208220 and the palletizers are.
**Speaker 1**: Yes.
**Speaker 0**: They can't do 480.
**Speaker 0**: 400 whatever they're made.
**Speaker 1**: But they.
**Speaker 1**: They typically Don't.
**Speaker 0**: Okay.
**Speaker 0**: So it'll be a mix of 2 480.
**Speaker 1**: So.
**Speaker 1**: So yeah, we have step down transformers in the.
**Speaker 1**: In the corner of each palletizer.
**Speaker 0**: You have those on machine or near machine.
**Speaker 0**: You drop a 480 and you step it down.
**Speaker 1**: Yep.
**Speaker 0**: So that transformer is part of your machine.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: It'll sit just inside the cage actually.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: So we just need to bring the drop.
**Speaker 1**: Yep.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: I mean for the.
**Speaker 0**: For the sake of where we're at right now, just say the drops are 480.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: You'll have some lighting transformers right where you have 110 here and there.
**Speaker 0**: But.
**Speaker 0**: But overlaid over the top of this as time goes on, I'll put here are all the drops.
**Speaker 0**: Here's where they are here.
**Speaker 0**: It's.
**Speaker 0**: Yep.
**Speaker 0**: Pretty far along from a standpoint of what equipment could probably.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, they have that again having this layout it gives us enough to where again we'll be able to run the footage off 480 based up where the washroom is.
**Speaker 0**: I mean, you know, if it turns out it's going to be smaller that just saves.
**Speaker 0**: So there's a.
**Speaker 0**: Another controls wallet here.
**Speaker 0**: Right where the PLCs and anything we can get in here to not be out on the floor and exposed we'll put in here.
**Speaker 0**: So there'll be drops of air as well.
**Speaker 0**: That makes sense.
**Speaker 0**: Yep.
**Speaker 0**: So structurally, you know, kind of you got firewalls, you got a mezzanine office area and you got this little containment area.
**Speaker 0**: And for the concrete floor and concrete it's just all one level.
**Speaker 0**: There's not nothing that's going to be heavy enough for a little car, its own footers or anything like that.
**Speaker 0**: Any special.
**Speaker 0**: So did they stuff in just some like the sewer is.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, yeah.
**Speaker 0**: It's literally just stuffed in here and there's no nothing else.
**Speaker 0**: So we'll just have to run across the floor then over to the bathroom.
**Speaker 0**: They don't kite you any headaches yet.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: Is it polished concrete floors right now there's no floor.
**Speaker 0**: Standard warehouse floor.
**Speaker 0**: Warehouse floor.
**Speaker 0**: Yep.
**Speaker 0**: So it'll be you know, 30, 35 FFFL numbers.
**Speaker 0**: You know you don't need a super flat or anything, right?
**Speaker 0**: No.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: All packaging equipment and racks moments.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: I mean that's.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: Again obviously the warehouse side firsttained everything.
**Speaker 0**: There's not a ton that you guys are doing different other than again the sprinkler and then putting those either going from your relative humidity differs and then putting the units on the ground versus the roof other than that, that's pretty basic.
**Speaker 0**: And then.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, the manufacturing ones, again, just got to run all the, figure out all the distances, the drops, all your water.
**Speaker 0**: Do you need like airlines or anything?
**Speaker 0**: So I need air to the.
**Speaker 0**: Okay.
**Speaker 0**: So that's probably easiest to make a loop thing then the compressor location on there.
**Speaker 0**: Okay.
**Speaker 0**: That'll be fire.
**Speaker 0**: Fire riser, mechanical prepare.
**Speaker 0**: Okay.
**Speaker 0**: What kind of piping do you use for that?
**Speaker 0**: If that reacts to copper or other metals or is there one specifically?
**Speaker 0**: So, Kevin, have you guys been using CPVC for air?
**Speaker 0**: I think he messaged us that he had to jump off to another call.
**Speaker 0**: I think they've been using cpvc.
**Speaker 0**: So then for your water, I would say we need packs.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: Plastic does quite well with zinc tuner.
**Speaker 0**: It's strange that actually stainless is worse than plane carbon, really, particularly if it's wet or moist.
**Speaker 0**: If it's liquefied, it just heats that oxidation layer off all that we just continuously and liquefies across very fast.
**Speaker 0**: So, you know, some of the biggest things, and I think we should be fine with that timeline is just making sure the gear you're switching, that's the longest lead time.
**Speaker 0**: It could be 10 to 10 to 14 months.
**Speaker 0**: So that's what you're saying to, you know, get moving and then you're, you're precast.
**Speaker 0**: We have to get a slot for next year which we can reserve for this.
**Speaker 0**: This is a big building.
**Speaker 0**: Fortunately, so does that in demand.
**Speaker 0**: So the way, the way it works is like.
**Speaker 0**: So like there's still slots left now.
**Speaker 0**: They'll probably dry up.
**Speaker 0**: October time frame, I'd say most of them.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: So.
**Speaker 0**: So we could, we could certainly get.
**Speaker 0**: That's just another.
**Speaker 0**: We could certainly get in a slot and kind of order that.
**Speaker 0**: Yes.
**Speaker 0**: With 50,000 square foot building.
**Speaker 0**: I'm not worried about it, especially with this time frame where we're at.
**Speaker 0**: And the same with the electrical gear.
**Speaker 0**: We can, we can nail down size, get the big gear.
**Speaker 0**: Yes.
**Speaker 0**: Just decide where all the drops are going to be later.
**Speaker 0**: You think the breakers, one of the breakers, you want to come in with it?
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: There should be no reason to get that stuff out early.
**Speaker 0**: And you mentioned about, you know, starting.
**Speaker 0**: I mean, presumably could even push around dirt and stuff earlier.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: So you could do, you could do a split, you know, split permit.
**Speaker 0**: Right.
**Speaker 0**: So we could do civil.
**Speaker 0**: The biggest thing I would say that we probably want to move on is your geotech because we need to understand what that ground is like because that's going to tell us if we have to stabilize or whatever because those don't know what the dirt is.
**Speaker 0**: I would think if did they wherever you got those as built, they.
**Speaker 0**: If they kept things, they should have the original soils report.
**Speaker 0**: They should.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: And that would good.
**Speaker 0**: Well if they get bored, I'm sure they did.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: Because they.
**Speaker 0**: There's.
**Speaker 0**: There's nothing where this new building is going.
**Speaker 0**: There's nothing there.
**Speaker 0**: I don't know why they would do boards there.
**Speaker 0**: Well what I'm saying is though, if they did like on some sites, if you got a 10 acre site, you manly put one boring in this building.
**Speaker 0**: So like if they did any boring for this building.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, I mean it was one big open field.
**Speaker 0**: So those likelihood.
**Speaker 0**: If this was okay, that's still probably worth doing another depending on when they did it.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, yeah.
**Speaker 0**: I mean if we had.
**Speaker 0**: I know because we're talking about like winter months.
**Speaker 0**: The only way to counteract that would be to beat the winter months.
**Speaker 0**: If we had the soil report and we could pour the foundations before ground freezing.
**Speaker 0**: So I can.
**Speaker 0**: I have money is approved for engineering and stuff like that.
**Speaker 0**: Like if we wanted to go.
**Speaker 0**: If you get early and get ahead of that, if you did, if you did do that then your schedule does change because once you get out of the ground with the.
**Speaker 0**: With those footers and stuff, winter conditions aren't a problem anymore.
**Speaker 0**: Right.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: And I mean this fortunately for you know, for these warehouses it's a simple strip footer all the way around.
**Speaker 0**: Right.
**Speaker 0**: So and then you could literally.
**Speaker 0**: Then we set the walls, put everything in there and leave everything out, you know, inside and comport it later.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, I have, right now I have approval to purchase the building, approval to do all the engineering associated.
**Speaker 0**: We have a December or November, late November board meeting.
**Speaker 0**: We'll approve that rest of the funds based on short up estimates and all that stuff.
**Speaker 0**: But that could.
**Speaker 0**: We could do it earlier if necessary if that drives, you know.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: But far as far as getting so samples done and stuff, I can do that out of the engineering side.
**Speaker 0**: So we can at least get that tackled.
**Speaker 0**: And if we.
**Speaker 0**: If we want to get footers in or whatever, we can.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: Probably get a good deal on sales report too.
**Speaker 0**: If it's the same company.
**Speaker 0**: If you find out who did that.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, I think all that stuff's available.
**Speaker 0**: They've been really good about starting over.
**Speaker 0**: I think they built it as a, you know or the spectrum of the park, dude.
**Speaker 0**: So yeah, if you can get us that score supports and we'll look at it and tell you, you know what you Need.
**Speaker 0**: Right.
**Speaker 0**: As far as, you know, if you have to stabilize, if you have to bring in dirt, take out dirt, whatever that looks like.
**Speaker 0**: So the part and the parts that they had, they built up.
**Speaker 0**: They built it up that level.
**Speaker 0**: Free dirt.
**Speaker 0**: We want.
**Speaker 0**: Beautiful.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, so that's good.
**Speaker 0**: Circle fill.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: So 7,000 acres.
**Speaker 0**: So as far as the next steps, like, obviously send us this and then so we'll, we'll take this and probably want to, you know, I'll measure that.
**Speaker 0**: But we're going to make sure we bounce that building out, you know, 15ft or so, which is going to tell us what our core, you know, so, yeah, I think.
**Speaker 0**: Where is it?
**Speaker 0**: 15.
**Speaker 0**: And so then that way we'll, you know, just how I have this, you know, broken out, we'll have another one just like this.
**Speaker 0**: But for the existing building, it goes through and detail everything.
**Speaker 0**: And then, yeah, if we could get that Geotech report and then, you know, if we can get started at least on preliminary civils, that would be huge to be able to get you to be able to start moving dirt because, I mean, ideally they're again, they've got the fill there.
**Speaker 0**: They come in like, I, I didn't, I didn't expect, I expected a bounce site by the looks of it.
**Speaker 0**: So, you know, there's not a ton of earthwork to do to get in there, get it done, stabilize.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, they, they brought this, this one up.
**Speaker 0**: There's definitely brought dirt in existing ones.
**Speaker 0**: Hey, Kevin, what was the question for Gavin they were asking?
**Speaker 0**: Oh, the Geotech for the airlines.
**Speaker 0**: Oh, airlines.
**Speaker 0**: All right.
**Speaker 0**: Have you guys been using CPVC for airline.
**Speaker 1**: Now?
**Speaker 1**: We've been using all the painted aluminum.
**Speaker 0**: Painted aluminum.
**Speaker 0**: Is that you have a preference for that or is that just what you've been using?
**Speaker 1**: That's just what we've been using.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, I would definitely stick to CPVC for that.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, you're probably correct.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, that's paint.
**Speaker 0**: If it chips, then.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, so, yeah, so that, that we use pvc.
**Speaker 0**: PVC for that whole plant.
**Speaker 0**: Kevin and I built like I was everywhere.
**Speaker 1**: Yep, I, I agree with that.
**Speaker 1**: And outside, just what we've had.
**Speaker 0**: Okay.
**Speaker 0**: All right, so do you want me to pull out design from this and give you a separate.
**Speaker 0**: Yes.
**Speaker 0**: Okay.
**Speaker 0**: Like separate things out.
**Speaker 0**: Yep.
**Speaker 0**: So I'll get that pulled out permitting design or like all that front end stuff.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: And then also support for environmental permitting that hold.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, that's going to come with it.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, so that's included.
**Speaker 0**: So, yeah, so we'll, we'll pull out basically your call it precon.
**Speaker 0**: So all of your upfront design everything.
**Speaker 0**: And then that way I'll send that to you and then we'll go ahead and we'll get to work on getting.
**Speaker 0**: Getting this stuff updated based off of this floor plan, you know, updating the units to you know, air change converts, putting it, you know, on the ground.
**Speaker 0**: And send me the.
**Speaker 0**: When you send this as a CAD as well, if you would.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: And then send us that NDA and that one will get it signed.
**Speaker 0**: And then just make sure anywhere in here you don't have anything about the company's name.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, okay.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: That way we can, we can share it without having to get a zillion NDA signed.
**Speaker 0**: And then we're just calling this project Vermillion Rise.
**Speaker 0**: Is that good for you or is there a certain name you want to address as?
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, yeah, no that's.
**Speaker 0**: That's good.
**Speaker 0**: We've got a couple different names.
**Speaker 0**: But that from.
**Speaker 0**: For you, that just gives you.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, this just gives a blanket way to come, you know, send it out.
**Speaker 0**: I'll make it clear.
**Speaker 0**: Like this was.
**Speaker 0**: Would be a block wall.
**Speaker 0**: It's a H vac.
**Speaker 0**: Change a few things here.
**Speaker 0**: I don't know if it'd be easier just build it all out together or as far as this, this area right here, all block wall or why block?
**Speaker 0**: Well, integrity for the drives and controls.
**Speaker 0**: Okay.
**Speaker 0**: The rest of it is.
**Speaker 0**: And having its own H vac.
**Speaker 0**: So for instance, like you know, it's an 8 inch block.
**Speaker 0**: Is it 6 and 10 inch block?
**Speaker 0**: Do you have any kind of specs like that or is there a load variable?
**Speaker 0**: No, I don't have respect for that.
**Speaker 0**: I would imagine a 6 inch block would be fine.
**Speaker 0**: So.
**Speaker 0**: And then they don't need to be filled or anything.
**Speaker 0**: Right.
**Speaker 0**: I don't know.
**Speaker 0**: There's not.
**Speaker 0**: There's not a lot of like physical load things mounted to the wall like electrical cure, plywood board.
**Speaker 0**: So basically you have the block just so that nothing runs through the wall.
**Speaker 0**: Is that it?
**Speaker 0**: Yes.
**Speaker 0**: So you don't have that since you have some integrity from.
**Speaker 0**: And you don't have anything coming in from the top.
**Speaker 0**: It sealed a little better.
**Speaker 0**: It could be firewall I guess but.
**Speaker 0**: So is this something I was wondering that difference across between a full height block wall in that building.
**Speaker 0**: Is there 30 foot ceiling?
**Speaker 0**: Just pour a concrete lid on.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: And I wouldn't necessarily make it full height.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, he wants, he wants it enclosed.
**Speaker 0**: I'm just.
**Speaker 0**: I'm thinking, you know, you know, if we just do a drywall wall versus you know, inlaid versus a block.
**Speaker 0**: That's why I was asking what, what if it's just the damage?
**Speaker 0**: Because if you're worried about like a forklift or something doing in there, you can put, you know, this little L bracket.
**Speaker 0**: We do them a lot in different warehouses.
**Speaker 0**: Damage, it's water.
**Speaker 0**: It's all, you know, typically done drives and control houses in block or fast.
**Speaker 0**: Concrete crap.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: So what is this?
**Speaker 0**: Maybe 10 foot tall?
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: Okay, 10 foot tall.
**Speaker 0**: The wall.
**Speaker 0**: These other areas, these are all just open areas.
**Speaker 0**: The ones that don't have like a door on them, open areas for equipment.
**Speaker 0**: And then maybe somebody have a similar setup at other locations.
**Speaker 0**: No, the other locations are quite different.
**Speaker 0**: Okay.
**Speaker 0**: Kevin, do you have electrical gear rooms and any of your facilities?
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, we do.
**Speaker 1**: And they're like at our.
**Speaker 1**: I'll just say our west facilities.
**Speaker 1**: Our newest building.
**Speaker 1**: It's a.
**Speaker 0**: It's.
**Speaker 1**: It's block.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: You wouldn't mind kind of just taking some pictures of these spaces and just sending it to us and that way we can really understand what you're looking for.
**Speaker 0**: And we just do a turn down slab.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: Around the.
**Speaker 0**: Where the walls are and the black wall up.
**Speaker 0**: Exactly.
**Speaker 0**: Yep.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: I don't think it's complicated.
**Speaker 0**: It's just a little bit higher.
**Speaker 0**: Integrity room.
**Speaker 0**: Yep, easy enough.
**Speaker 0**: And same you have that here, here and that other vault, then conditioning there in the little breezeway between the two buildings.
**Speaker 0**: Is that just going to be unconditioned?
**Speaker 0**: Not unconditioned.
**Speaker 0**: These are going to be open.
**Speaker 0**: This one would be a firewall or a fire door.
**Speaker 0**: This is a regular roll up door.
**Speaker 0**: Just open all the time.
**Speaker 0**: I see though these doors will be open.
**Speaker 0**: Even the pass through doors will be open every time.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, yeah.
**Speaker 0**: Four trucks are just driving back and forth.
**Speaker 0**: Only an event of a, you know, of a fire react with that one closed.
**Speaker 0**: This would just be a regular chain pole.
**Speaker 0**: Probably never get closed.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, just a sustainer coil.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: Perfect.
**Speaker 0**: Makes sense.
**Speaker 0**: Yep.
**Speaker 0**: So long.
**Speaker 0**: We're coming to pick me up in four minutes.
**Speaker 0**: All right.
**Speaker 0**: Well, yeah, like I said, I'll get this pulled out, sent to you.
**Speaker 0**: Choose the, the geotech as you can.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: And then that way you can get approval on that and get some point there it is, how it's going and then you know, we'll go ahead and start.
**Speaker 0**: I'll confirm on our precast slots how soon we could get it and then you know, same thing with our gear.
**Speaker 0**: But yeah, I mean we can again potentially get an early release and start scraping before it gets cold.
**Speaker 0**: I've got.
**Speaker 0**: I was rearranging some racks in here.
**Speaker 0**: I'll finish that over the weekend.
**Speaker 0**: I'll get this to you by Monday morning first thing with a couple other notes and stuff.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Mark, Mark, just for.
**Speaker 1**: For your sake, on some of those racks.
**Speaker 1**: I see you got four deep racks along.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, yeah.
**Speaker 0**: I was starting to fix all.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: Where is that?
**Speaker 0**: Like how you.
**Speaker 0**: 100.
**Speaker 0**: That's what I was adjusting.
**Speaker 1**: Gotcha.
**Speaker 0**: Because you're gonna.
**Speaker 0**: Are you gonna have those forklift dials between each one?
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: You set it too.
**Speaker 0**: Okay.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: So then.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, shoot me all that with the hazardous information and then we'll price up your Interacts too.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: So.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, I'll put class one, class two oxidizer.
**Speaker 0**: You don't have any aerosol, do you?
**Speaker 0**: No.
**Speaker 0**: Perfect.
**Speaker 0**: Packaging supplies, you know, pallets, buckets.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: Bottles.
**Speaker 0**: That scheme A is the same thing we're doing in Harrisburg.
**Speaker 0**: Exactly.
**Speaker 0**: Oxidizers everywhere.
**Speaker 0**: And I've got SDS for.
**Speaker 0**: For all these finished raw materials.
**Speaker 0**: I'll send that as good a bit as well.
**Speaker 0**: Perfect.
**Speaker 0**: All right.
**Speaker 0**: To me.
**Speaker 0**: Thanks.
**Speaker 0**: Looking forward to it.
**Speaker 0**: Be fun.
**Speaker 0**: Kevin, it's nice to meet you.
**Speaker 1**: Nice to meet you guys.
**Speaker 1**: Appreciate it.
**Speaker 0**: Okay.
**Speaker 0**: What else do we got?
**Speaker 0**: I'll fast.
**Speaker 0**: You could.
**Speaker 0**: Thanks.
**Speaker 0**: Turn around a revised estimate if you get your stuff on Monday.
**Speaker 0**: I mean the.
**Speaker 0**: The.
**Speaker 0**: I mean, two weeks easily.
**Speaker 0**: On the.
**Speaker 0**: On the existing warehouse building excite.
**Speaker 0**: I mean, we.
**Speaker 0**: You know, the interact.
**Speaker 0**: We already know.
**Speaker 0**: And I just got it.
**Speaker 0**: There's not a lot we have to change on it.
**Speaker 0**: And then I'd say.
**Speaker 0**: Let me wrap my head around the build out.
**Speaker 0**: Let's say three.
**Speaker 0**: I could probably get something on that.
**Speaker 0**: I just.
**Speaker 0**: Because I have to develop all the scopes on that first.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah.
**Speaker 0**: And then the.
**Speaker 0**: The design stuff.
**Speaker 0**: I'll pull that out and have it to you Tuesday.
**Speaker 0**: Okay.
**Speaker 0**: That'd be easy.
**Speaker 0**: All right.
**Speaker 0**: And I gave you the list of dates and stuff, right?
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, I responded to you.
**Speaker 0**: We need to maintain that schedule.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, I don't think that's going to be an issue.
**Speaker 0**: Yeah, I don't think that'd be an issue at all.
**Speaker 0**: Okay.
**Speaker 0**: We'll check lead times, you know, and everything.
**Speaker 0**: And I'm.
**Speaker 0**: Yes.
**Speaker 0**: Okay.
**Speaker 0**: Kevin, do you have any questions?
**Speaker 1**: I. I do not right now, Mark.
**Speaker 0**: No.
**Speaker 0**: Okay.
**Speaker 0**: All right.
**Speaker 0**: I'll.
**Speaker 0**: I'll try to add to the.
**Speaker 0**: The narrative.
**Speaker 0**: And I'll send that to you and Ben sometime over the weekend to get your take on it as well so that we're all talking from the same page.
**Speaker 0**: Okay, perfect.
**Speaker 0**: All right, great.
**Speaker 0**: Thanks, Kevin.
**Speaker 0**: Thanks, Kevin, for jumping on.
**Speaker 1**: Thanks, everyone.
