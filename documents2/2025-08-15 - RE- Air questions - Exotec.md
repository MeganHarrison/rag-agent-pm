## Transcript
**Joseph.burdzy**: Hey, Jesse.
**Lyon.muswere**: Hey, Gaba.
**Lyon.muswere**: Sorry, I didn't realize I was muted.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Oh, good.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Helion.
**Lyon.muswere**: You guys hear me?
**Joseph.burdzy**: Yes.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Piano.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Just wait for.
**Mparsons**: Joel should be joining me in a minute.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: Where are you guys based out of?
**Mparsons**: Are you in New Jersey or you're in Pennsylvania?
**Joseph.burdzy**: I am in Florida.
**Mparsons**: Ah, Florida.
**Lyon.muswere**: Okay.
**Lyon.muswere**: Yeah, yeah.
**Joseph.burdzy**: And Jesse is in Arizona.
**Lyon.muswere**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: Is that where, like the company is based?
**Joseph.burdzy**: The company is headquartered in Indiana and we just opened a new office in Tampa.
**Lyon.muswere**: Okay.
**Mparsons**: Where are you guys based in Atlanta.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Gotcha.
**Lyon.muswere**: Okay.
**Lyon.muswere**: I just kind of got lost in the desert.
**Joseph.burdzy**: He's thinking about moving to Florida.
**Mparsons**: How's the.
**Mparsons**: How's the heat over there?
**Joseph.burdzy**: How is that?
**Joseph.burdzy**: What?
**Lyon.muswere**: The heat in Phoenix?
**Mparsons**: Yeah, yeah, in Phoenix.
**Lyon.muswere**: It's been over 110 every day.
**Mparsons**: Yeah, I was there last summer and it was, I think like 118.
**Mparsons**: And then I went up to the Grand Canyon.
**Mparsons**: It was much cooler.
**Lyon.muswere**: Oh, yeah, it was much hotter last summer than this summer overall.
**Lyon.muswere**: Okay, I'm gonna hop up and hop back in real quick.
**Lyon.muswere**: Okay.
**Lyon.muswere**: Hey, Joe.
**Jdawson**: What'S up?
**Mparsons**: I was just messaging you.
**Jdawson**: Well, you're the one that can answer all the questions.
**Jdawson**: You can go for it.
**Mparsons**: All right, Kevin, So I sent you a draft of like an srs.
**Mparsons**: It's just a standard system requirements that we have at Exotec.
**Mparsons**: Yes, I'm sure you have a lot of questions, technical or otherwise.
**Mparsons**: We can discuss them in this meeting and make sure we're on the same page.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Yeah, I'm going to share my screen real quick.
**Joseph.burdzy**: I have.
**Joseph.burdzy**: So I did look through the specifications that you sent and I was trying to compare it to the initial drawing that we received from tpg, the architects.
**Joseph.burdzy**: And one of the things that stood out was they have a basis of design of this model, but that definitely.
**Joseph.burdzy**: I don't know if your specifications are newer than their drawings, but it would not work because I think in the specification you mentioned that it's supposed to be an oil free system.
**Joseph.burdzy**: And this one that they have here is not that.
**Mparsons**: So this drawing is from.
**Mparsons**: Can you come again?
**Mparsons**: Where is it coming from?
**Mparsons**: Is it like just a different system or.
**Joseph.burdzy**: This is the architectural drawing.
**Joseph.burdzy**: This permits that we have for the entire project.
**Mparsons**: Okay, where did we get these specifications?
**Mparsons**: Because it looks like you already have a. I mean, you have a drawing with the architecture like you mentioned, but we never.
**Mparsons**: I don't know, Joe, did we submit any kind of srs?
**Mparsons**: Was it part of alleatogroup scope to just investigate and see what other options they can provide for this solution?
**Jdawson**: They were Providing they knew it was going to be two air compressors, we gave them the sizes that we.
**Jdawson**: We were estimating it was going to be.
**Jdawson**: And then they had to drill out the drain and put in this oil separator in order to meet code.
**Lyon.muswere**: Okay.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Yeah.
**Joseph.burdzy**: So this, this part of it is called done.
**Joseph.burdzy**: We have these pipes in the floor and the oil separator is already installed.
**Joseph.burdzy**: And we are also running power to the compressor.
**Joseph.burdzy**: That's what was in our scope.
**Lyon.muswere**: Yeah.
**Joseph.burdzy**: So I don't know if the architect just copied this from some project and put this here or this is based on information he received from you guys, but this model that he's asking for here definitely does not go with the scope.
**Joseph.burdzy**: The specifications in here.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, and how so, like, is it bigger or smaller?
**Jdawson**: What are we talking about?
**Joseph.burdzy**: It is smaller.
**Joseph.burdzy**: It would not let me bring this in.
**Joseph.burdzy**: So I pulled all these numbers from the requirements in your specifications so that one specifically would not be able to supply all the psi that's required.
**Joseph.burdzy**: There are a few three options that I found that would work with the requirements that you guys have.
**Joseph.burdzy**: See if I can open it.
**Joseph.burdzy**: So there are these three options.
**Joseph.burdzy**: I can share this with you and you can maybe compare to see if it meets all requirements.
**Joseph.burdzy**: But I think this will.
**Joseph.burdzy**: These wood.
**Joseph.burdzy**: This one specifically is.
**Joseph.burdzy**: I guess the advantage of this one is it is more compact.
**Joseph.burdzy**: This one is more energy friendly.
**Joseph.burdzy**: And this is the interval between maintenance on this one is.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Is higher, I guess.
**Jdawson**: Which one is the cheapest?
**Joseph.burdzy**: I actually have not looked at the pricing yet.
**Jdawson**: Again, I get these are all good points, but honestly, yes, we're looking for something.
**Jdawson**: We're just looking for a design that can meet the specs that we have and the most cost effective.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Gotcha.
**Jdawson**: I mean, to be honest, like just, just, just a little background information.
**Jdawson**: I don't know why Uniqlo is.
**Jdawson**: This scope is normally.
**Jdawson**: We put on.
**Jdawson**: This is normally the customer scope on every project that we ever do.
**Jdawson**: For some reason, Uniqlo just refuses to take on the pneumatic portion of.
**Jdawson**: And so, I mean, that's why we're kind of looking for somebody else to take on the entire scope.
**Jdawson**: Just because we don't have anybody here at Exotech that is an expert in this by any means.
**Jdawson**: So we're, you know, we kind of just have a budgeted amount, which I know is probably not enough.
**Jdawson**: And we're just looking for somebody to show us what to do because honestly, we don't know this is something we normally don't do.
**Jremillard**: Hey, Joe, This Is Jesse.
**Lyon.muswere**: Hey.
**Jremillard**: So the, that's what I was thinking.
**Jremillard**: Like, they're the ones that are going to be maintaining these things, aren't they?
**Jdawson**: Correct.
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: And then as far as, like the, the piping layout, sizing, all of that, are we going, is there anything on these?
**Jremillard**: Like, do they even show the air compressor piping?
**Jremillard**: I don't think there's any info on that.
**Jdawson**: I don't think they do at all.
**Jdawson**: Like I said, we don't, we don't know.
**Jdawson**: We don't know.
**Jdawson**: We just.
**Jdawson**: These are the specifications that were kind of estimated for us.
**Jdawson**: We tried to overestimate with the size of whatever these compressors are, just to have two compressors that can fail over to each other.
**Jdawson**: We know at our other site in Europe, they actually have three medium sized compressors where two of them work at all times and then one of them changes every, like every week or something like that just to keep the redundancy going.
**Jdawson**: And so for this one, we were trying to just make it a little simpler and say, let's just get two air compressors.
**Jdawson**: One should be able to handle everything and then the other is used as a failover, but every however long, you know, and I, I don't care how long it is, but it'll just switch just so one isn't getting worn out and the other's not getting used at all.
**Jremillard**: Automatic.
**Lyon.muswere**: Yeah.
**Joseph.burdzy**: And June, do you remember you guys giving the Architect this information or you think.
**Jdawson**: I think the Architect came up with this.
**Jdawson**: I think Ahmed and them came up with this because then they started bringing up the guidelines for oil separators and all of this.
**Jdawson**: And it's like, honestly, we had no, we, we didn't know anything about that.
**Jdawson**: We just know that, hey, you need to provide us a place that has a drain that, you know, these air compressors can drain into.
**Jremillard**: And were you responsible for that curb around the equipment too, supposedly compressor?
**Jdawson**: No, I think they, they looked up the.
**Jdawson**: What would be the amount of, you know, because they have three feet marked off here, amount of clearance you need around these things.
**Jremillard**: But if you go, Kevin, if you can go up a little bit, it says provide protective curve around equipment.
**Jremillard**: Are they just talking like a six by six steel angle so that the forklifts don't drive over into this thing?
**Jdawson**: Yes, but I don't think that's, that's not going to be in our scope.
**Jdawson**: That's not the scope I'm asking you all for.
**Lyon.muswere**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: I'm just thinking, is that, is that, was that not part of what alleatogroup was assigned for in the first.
**Jdawson**: At the beginning, I don't think we.
**Jremillard**: Have any mention of any kind of steel curbing.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, just make sure of that.
**Mparsons**: I was like curious like.
**Mparsons**: So the area you have here, was it the one that the customer recommended?
**Mparsons**: You put the air compressor or.
**Mparsons**: This is just a draft.
**Jdawson**: This is where it's going.
**Mparsons**: This is where it's going.
**Mparsons**: Okay, so we have.
**Mparsons**: What's the dimension?
**Mparsons**: Because the one that we got from Ukita the other time was a 4 meter by 4 meter area next to the shack.
**Mparsons**: But I guess it doesn't really matter if the drainage is.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, moving it now is not an option.
**Lyon.muswere**: No.
**Jremillard**: Whether you could get more.
**Jremillard**: If you need more room in the warehouse, I don't think anything close to this stuff.
**Jremillard**: So we can just make that containment area a little bigger.
**Jremillard**: I'm thinking Jesse R. Like the floor finish.
**Jremillard**: If we got to put curb in here, it might be easier to just paint that whole area the same color as the bathroom.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Lyon.muswere**: It just depends on how it's gonna break on the.
**Lyon.muswere**: On the perimeters of it, I would say.
**Lyon.muswere**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: Then we just have a little bit of polishing to do.
**Jremillard**: Where it goes over and through the door.
**Lyon.muswere**: Yeah.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Well.
**Jremillard**: I would say we need a little bit of help.
**Jremillard**: So on.
**Jremillard**: As far as what I was asking Keba, like if you can mark up on your drawing, if there is such a thing, showing each like connection point for whatever in the size that that connection point is of the air.
**Jremillard**: And then we can get with.
**Jremillard**: I don't know if Henderson would do it, but just to be able to size that pipe so that you got the right volume feeding everything.
**Jremillard**: And then.
**Jremillard**: Sure, that would be a whole nother thing.
**Jremillard**: Something that would alternate those two pumps.
**Jremillard**: You have to look at that.
**Jremillard**: There's no, no design on these drawings for that.
**Jremillard**: So, Joe, is that something.
**Jremillard**: I think you're muted if you're trying to talk.
**Jdawson**: Now what.
**Jdawson**: What do you need for.
**Jdawson**: What do you need from us?
**Jremillard**: Like on your drawings?
**Jremillard**: Like, where is the connection point?
**Jdawson**: So these.
**Jdawson**: These aren't our drawings.
**Jremillard**: Well, that's what.
**Jremillard**: That's what I'm saying.
**Jremillard**: Like on a set of your drawings, if you would just mark out like, hey, we need a half inch airline plugged in right here on this rack or this machine right here.
**Jremillard**: So that we can figure out.
**Mparsons**: Yeah, we'll provide the drawings with the actual equipment that is being routed too.
**Mparsons**: But like Joe mentioned, like we actually relying on the design phase to like size the pipes even.
**Mparsons**: So we don't know if it's going to be quarter of an inch.
**Mparsons**: I mean, I guess I did define the terminal, but for the supply itself, we don't know, like the piping sizing that is going to be.
**Lyon.muswere**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jremillard**: If you give us the termination and the location of where it's tying into, then we can get with the engineers and have them size the pipe.
**Lyon.muswere**: Okay.
**Lyon.muswere**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And can we run this error along the sky path.
**Jremillard**: Lyon?
**Mparsons**: Yeah, So, I mean, I did put that requirement.
**Mparsons**: So if you look at requirement 11, you do have the flexibility to route the piping alongside the.
**Mparsons**: Alongside or under the.
**Lyon.muswere**: The conveyor.
**Mparsons**: So requirement 11 is a little bit further down.
**Mparsons**: Oh, I think you passed said piping.
**Lyon.muswere**: Yeah, saw that.
**Jdawson**: Keep going.
**Mparsons**: It's a page seven.
**Lyon.muswere**: Yep.
**Lyon.muswere**: Right there.
**Jremillard**: So we can do one drop to feed multiple things and just run it underneath on your actual.
**Lyon.muswere**: If.
**Jdawson**: If you can get it there.
**Jdawson**: If you can get away with one drop.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I don't know if it will require because it's pretty spread out, but whatever.
**Jdawson**: Is this the simple.
**Jdawson**: I mean, we're looking for simple here.
**Jdawson**: Like I said, this isn't a scope that we normally take on at all.
**Jdawson**: You know, to be honest, it's the first time we've had to do that here in the US So that's why we asked alleatogroup, too, because we've had.
**Jdawson**: We've been trying to find somebody for a while now and we can't find somebody that will do.
**Jdawson**: Like we found someone who will engineer it and then.
**Jdawson**: But then someone else has to procure it and then someone else has to install it and we're just looking for one.
**Jdawson**: And done.
**Lyon.muswere**: Yeah.
**Lyon.muswere**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: Any and the.
**Jremillard**: Again, the specs on the piping and all that.
**Jremillard**: You don't care or do you have something in mind you'd want it to be?
**Mparsons**: No, nothing specific.
**Mparsons**: It's just you let us know what we need to confirm with our suppliers in terms of the terminals, maybe we can have it as standard instead of each supplier having their own terminal connection type.
**Mparsons**: But it's really just you guys consulting us on what we need and maybe we need to change some things in the.
**Mparsons**: In this document.
**Mparsons**: Some things don't make sense or some things there are.
**Mparsons**: You just can't provide them in the design phase.
**Mparsons**: I mean, we're looking into like just having an opal open dialogue for something.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, yeah, there's things too.
**Jremillard**: Like, you know, do these need to be like, detachable so you can unhook one component if it's messing up and keep the air onto everything?
**Jremillard**: Else.
**Jremillard**: Or is this like, if one thing's not working, the whole thing's not working?
**Lyon.muswere**: Yes.
**Mparsons**: So requirement two has.
**Mparsons**: I did put that.
**Mparsons**: It should have a.
**Mparsons**: Each delivery point.
**Mparsons**: We have a manual isolation valve.
**Lyon.muswere**: Okay.
**Lyon.muswere**: Yeah.
**Mparsons**: So, I mean, you know, you guys feel free to digest this document and maybe you can comment on it and, you know, send it back to us, or we can schedule another meeting to discuss the techno details.
**Mparsons**: But, I mean, the gist of it is we're looking for something simple.
**Mparsons**: We have.
**Mparsons**: We think we have all the data we need, but if we're missing something, we are happy to take that feedback and see if we can do a RFI to our suppliers.
**Lyon.muswere**: Okay.
**Lyon.muswere**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: It is kind of crazy.
**Jremillard**: Almost like the engineering I see.
**Jremillard**: You know, we can't be losing air pressure.
**Jdawson**: Deb, I guess the first question is of those options that you showed on another document.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Will.
**Jdawson**: Will those all fit in that area?
**Joseph.burdzy**: Good question.
**Joseph.burdzy**: I'm gonna have to look.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Look at their specifications and see how big they are.
**Joseph.burdzy**: But I think that first absent is small enough to fit.
**Jremillard**: What's the name of those things again?
**Lyon.muswere**: Keba.
**Joseph.burdzy**: These ones?
**Lyon.muswere**: Yeah.
**Joseph.burdzy**: I can put it up, actually.
**Joseph.burdzy**: So the first one is 128 by 104.
**Joseph.burdzy**: And I think this is the smallest out of the three options.
**Jdawson**: 128 what?
**Joseph.burdzy**: Inches.
**Mparsons**: It's about 3.2 meters.
**Jdawson**: It's almost 10ft.
**Jdawson**: Remember, we need two of them.
**Jdawson**: Or is that two of them in one?
**Joseph.burdzy**: That's just one of them.
**Joseph.burdzy**: I'll have to check, but it might be.
**Mparsons**: It says duplex at the top, Right.
**Mparsons**: So I'll assume it's two.
**Jremillard**: Does it have to be brand new?
**Jdawson**: I mean.
**Jremillard**: It has a warranty on it.
**Jremillard**: 32 grand for a used one.
**Jdawson**: I mean, if we can.
**Jdawson**: If we can buff it up and.
**Lyon.muswere**: We'Ll.
**Jremillard**: We'll package it like it's.
**Lyon.muswere**: Yeah, there you go.
**Jremillard**: And that's a gigantic air compressor.
**Jdawson**: I was about to say 10ft is the smallest one.
**Jdawson**: I feel like that's huge.
**Mparsons**: Does look nice, though.
**Jdawson**: Like I said, if that's.
**Jdawson**: If that is two of them in one, that's a different story.
**Mparsons**: Yeah.
**Mparsons**: I'm looking at the specs, and this says the duplex configuration provides redundancy.
**Mparsons**: I'm not sure to what extent if it's just matching compressors inside or it's just a smaller one to back up what the main one is getting going through maintenance.
**Jremillard**: Joe, hopefully your estimator didn't.
**Jremillard**: Might go to Home Depot, pick out an air compressor for your Budget.
**Jdawson**: Oh, all the budget.
**Jdawson**: I'll worry about the budget.
**Jdawson**: I'm just.
**Jdawson**: I just want it to fit and not have to go back and do change orders.
**Jdawson**: Is pulling teeth in in this project.
**Jdawson**: And, you know, we're all.
**Jdawson**: We're already bleeding money from just the.
**Jdawson**: Just a lot of stuff that they made us hurry up and do that we probably weren't ready for at the time, but we're dealing with it.
**Lyon.muswere**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: It'S like Brandon.
**Jdawson**: Brandon say when I talked to him the other day, he's like, I'm not doing any favors.
**Jdawson**: I was like, hey, we're in the same boat with them.
**Jdawson**: Like, trust me.
**Jremillard**: I can't believe you're paying for the extra heads.
**Jremillard**: Like, yeah.
**Joseph.burdzy**: It'S.
**Jdawson**: It's a negotiation that's still out.
**Jdawson**: That's still.
**Jdawson**: Still in talks, but yeah, it's.
**Jdawson**: It kind of was.
**Jdawson**: That was more of a miss on our part than the electrical, to be honest.
**Jremillard**: Okay, well, yeah, Cabo, chase down some of these different options for the air compressor.
**Jremillard**: We'll probably request that.
**Jremillard**: Henderson, like, just do a pipe diagram for us.
**Jremillard**: But if you can send us that.
**Jremillard**: Your drawing showing, like, where everything connects and the size of that connection, shouldn't be that hard for them to.
**Lyon.muswere**: Make.
**Jremillard**: Those calculations and get us a little drawing to set up and get our plumber to install it.
**Jdawson**: No, sounds good, Lyon, do you want to do that or are you going to task Cody with that?
**Mparsons**: With the drawing?
**Lyon.muswere**: Yeah.
**Mparsons**: Yeah, I can, I can, I can give it to Cody, but I think I do want to preface by saying, like, some of the equipment, we actually don't have the final footprint, but I'm not sure if those equipment are the ones that are pneumatic.
**Mparsons**: Might be just the non pneumatic ones.
**Mparsons**: I'll check with Cody.
**Mparsons**: Like, which, which equipment we have final blocks for.
**Mparsons**: Like, how accurate do you want these machines to be?
**Mparsons**: Because we can have an SB drawing.
**Lyon.muswere**: What's.
**Mparsons**: What's the tolerance?
**Jremillard**: Well, I think for if it's within 5 foot, 10 foot, or where it goes.
**Lyon.muswere**: Yeah, that should be fine.
**Lyon.muswere**: Okay.
**Lyon.muswere**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And I guess the name of the game here, Keba, is the smaller the better.
**Jdawson**: And if like, like Lyon was saying, if that 10 foot one is dual, like.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I mean, that would be.
**Jdawson**: I mean, I. I don't see why that wouldn't be a problem.
**Jdawson**: I think that would be the same footprint as two of these other ones.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Okay, yeah, I'll look, I'll look more into it and see if it has enough power to supply all of this.
**Joseph.burdzy**: And if if it is two in one, then we'll dig deeper into that one.
**Lyon.muswere**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Because the one that we put in these quotes, it looks like that they drew in here would be two of them at 75 inches by 33 inches, but we'd have two of them.
**Lyon.muswere**: Gotcha here.
**Jdawson**: I'll put it in the chat here.
**Jdawson**: This is what Google is telling me.
**Mparsons**: Yeah, I think, Joe, like, even the options that Keba has over here is they're all.
**Mparsons**: I mean, they all have in parentheses duplex.
**Mparsons**: So I'd assume it's some kind of redundancy system.
**Mparsons**: Just not sure the specification for it, whether it still support the entire system or half of it.
**Jdawson**: I would.
**Jdawson**: I mean, I don't.
**Jdawson**: Honestly, I don't know.
**Jdawson**: I don't know anything about air, but yeah, I get it.
**Jdawson**: Like this one says 30 horsepower.
**Jdawson**: How much is that other big one?
**Jdawson**: And honestly, I don't even think this horsepower matter.
**Jdawson**: 132 gallons.
**Jdawson**: I don't know what spec is the one that.
**Jdawson**: That, that matters to be able to figure out if you can support all this stuff.
**Joseph.burdzy**: On a different note, Joe, on the sprinkler, Sorry, the racking install, do you think by the week of see, September 8th through 12th, you guys would have enough racking done for our sprinkler guys to be putting in some pipes?
**Joseph.burdzy**: Because we are planning on visiting the job site when they are doing the 25 instruments.
**Jdawson**: I think they should have.
**Jdawson**: They.
**Jdawson**: There should be enough racking up to start piping probably the end of August, you know, by the end of that week.
**Jdawson**: Because as we do a row, if they start a second row right, you're not going to be able to get into that middle area.
**Jdawson**: So the team plans to start standing up racking, you know, either Friday the 22nd, which you won't have to be out there for the first day, but.
**Jdawson**: But definitely the 20.
**Jdawson**: I mean, 25th.
**Jdawson**: I mean, that.
**Jdawson**: That last week, I would definitely, probably be ready to start being able to come in behind us.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Gotcha.
**Joseph.burdzy**: All right, so we'll give.
**Joseph.burdzy**: If you guys are starting this and they will give another week.
**Joseph.burdzy**: And then the third week after that, we'll.
**Joseph.burdzy**: We'll come through.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Would you be on site to.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Or.
**Jdawson**: I'm gonna come out on.
**Jdawson**: I'll probably fly out the 25th.
**Lyon.muswere**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So I'll be there the beginning of that week.
**Jdawson**: I'll probably stay Monday through Thursday.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Gotcha.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Is that when Yusuke's being scoring one side too?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I think so.
**Jdawson**: I think he's gonna be out there for like three or four weeks, though.
**Joseph.burdzy**: All right, so if you guys can give us those drawings with their locations, you can start double rolling from there.
**Joseph.burdzy**: And meanwhile, I'll look into these different options for sizing and the power requirements and see what works.
**Jdawson**: That works.
**Mparsons**: Sounds like a plan.
**Joseph.burdzy**: All right.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Thank you guys for jumping on.
**Jdawson**: No, appreciate it.
**Jdawson**: Let me know if you need anything else.
**Jdawson**: Like I said, if you just want to, if you always email and just email myself and Lyon on there, one of us will get back to you as quick as possible.
**Jdawson**: And especially if you want to set up a meeting, I can.
**Jdawson**: I can reply to you.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Okay, sounds good.
**Joseph.burdzy**: We'll do.
**Lyon.muswere**: Thanks, ma'.
