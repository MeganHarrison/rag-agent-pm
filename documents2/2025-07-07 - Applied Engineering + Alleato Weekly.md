## Transcript
**Dmiles**: Hey, everybody.
**Mlehman**: Hello.
**Mlehman**: Hey.
**Mlehman**: Hey.
**Lhoran**: We can hear you.
**Mlehman**: AJ.
**Dmiles**: Can you guys hear me now?
**Mlehman**: Yep.
**Dmiles**: Awesome.
**Dmiles**: Mark, is there going to be anybody else from the applied team joining or can we go ahead and get going?
**Ahuettl**: I don't know that there is.
**Mlehman**: Okay.
**Ahuettl**: See?
**Ahuettl**: But I'm not aware of anybody.
**Mlehman**: Okay.
**Dmiles**: Well, hopefully everybody had a good fourth of July.
**Dmiles**: It was a long weekend, so we're hitting it hard on site now.
**Dmiles**: I know, Alex.
**Dmiles**: We got rough in going on Walls are Framed.
**Dmiles**: What else we got going on, Alex?
**Lhoran**: We'll have sprinkler going on this week and electrical and H vac.
**Mlehman**: Okay.
**Dmiles**: Mark, I know that you, I saw your email about wanting to, to do a walk.
**Dmiles**: I, I, we like to do that every time before we close anything up.
**Dmiles**: So here, once we get our rough and done, we'll, we'll get that on the schedule and we'll just make sure we have your blessing on locations of everything.
**Dmiles**: That way we can change them if we need to.
**Dmiles**: And then we'll start closing up walls after that.
**Ahuettl**: Okay, Sounds good.
**Dmiles**: Parallel team.
**Dmiles**: I, earlier today, I added you guys into Job Planner for some of the.
**Dmiles**: I think I put casework in there, some flooring and then acoustical ceilings.
**Dmiles**: If you have any issue viewing those in Job Planner for submittals, will you guys let me know?
**Lydia**: Yes, Happy to do that.
**Lydia**: Em and I were actually just talking.
**Lydia**: We haven't used Job Planner before, so we're going to poke around a little bit in it and get those submittals back to you as soon as possible.
**Lydia**: And if we have any issues, I'll either give you a call or shoot you an email.
**Mlehman**: Perfect.
**Dmiles**: Yeah.
**Dmiles**: I've never seen it from your end since I'm just the manager on it, so I don't know, I don't know what it looks like.
**Dmiles**: So it's, that's okay.
**Dmiles**: Let me know if you have any problems.
**Mlehman**: Okay.
**Lydia**: Yeah.
**Lydia**: And we'll probably send out either just to you or whatever.
**Lydia**: We keep our own submittal log and form and it kind of shows the status of every submittal that we reviewed to date and when we received them and got them back to you and kind of keeps those rolling and it's kind of a nice snapshot.
**Lydia**: So you'll probably be seeing those from us occasionally as well, just from our end.
**Lydia**: And we can include the applied team in that as well, just to keep track of what we're looking for from you, submittal wise.
**Lydia**: And then what we've got done today.
**Mlehman**: Yep.
**Dmiles**: Yeah, that would be great.
**Dmiles**: And then from an MEP standpoint Mark.
**Dmiles**: We're still waiting on stuff from the manufacturer for all the H vac, and as soon as I get that, I will share that with you and add you in there to Job Planner to the.
**Mlehman**: Okay.
**Ahuettl**: All right, Sounds good.
**Mlehman**: Okay.
**Dmiles**: And then, Lydia, we.
**Dmiles**: We had an rfi.
**Dmiles**: It was.
**Dmiles**: Had to do with the framing.
**Dmiles**: There was.
**Dmiles**: There was an issue with a column not showing up.
**Dmiles**: Let me share my screen here.
**Dmiles**: Can everybody see that?
**Ahuettl**: Yes.
**Dmiles**: So right here, we show a column in this mail room.
**Dmiles**: There's actually another column right here about.
**Dmiles**: So what we went ahead and did is framed this wall all the way across.
**Dmiles**: So we lost a little bit of room along this wall, I think.
**Dmiles**: Alex, how many inches was it?
**Dmiles**: 10, quarter.
**Dmiles**: 10 and a quarter inches.
**Dmiles**: So I'll get some photos together, and I'll shoot that over to you guys in an email so you can see what we did.
**Dmiles**: And if there's anything that we need to change, we'll go ahead and get that knocked out for you.
**Lydia**: Yeah.
**Lydia**: Can you go to the demo plan really quick?
**Lydia**: I'm just wondering if it exists in our.
**Lydia**: On our demo plan.
**Lydia**: Yeah, I feel like it's missing from our.
**Mlehman**: Yep.
**Lydia**: Our drawing completely.
**Lydia**: That's a weird place for a column, AJ and it's an actual column.
**Mlehman**: Yeah.
**Lydia**: Because it doesn't fall in the column lines.
**Dmiles**: Yeah.
**Dmiles**: What I think it.
**Dmiles**: Go ahead, Alex.
**Lhoran**: If you go to Job Planner, I put some pictures of it in there.
**Mlehman**: Okay.
**Mlehman**: Right here.
**Lhoran**: Yeah.
**Lhoran**: There's some fresh ones from today.
**Lydia**: Was it hidden inside another wall or was it laying out existing?
**Lhoran**: Yeah, it was.
**Lydia**: Yeah.
**Lydia**: We wouldn't be able to see it if it was inside the wall.
**Lydia**: And obviously we wouldn't notice that it was missing because it's kind of.
**Lydia**: I don't know.
**Lydia**: It's in a weird spot.
**Mlehman**: It looks like.
**Dmiles**: Yeah, right there.
**Lhoran**: Go back.
**Mlehman**: Yeah.
**Lhoran**: Now zoom in on that bottom, right.
**Mlehman**: Yep.
**Mlehman**: Yeah.
**Dmiles**: Emma, what I think it may be is, is that.
**Dmiles**: Is the.
**Dmiles**: The entrance right there, right above the entrance.
**Dmiles**: So I don't know if it's extra support for that overhang or what it is when you walk in.
**Dmiles**: And so what, like, what we did is we just framed this wall across to keep the guys rolling because we were going so quick last week, and with it being the short week and people out.
**Dmiles**: So I'll just log that in an email for you.
**Dmiles**: That way we got it on record.
**Lydia**: Yep.
**Mlehman**: And.
**Lydia**: Yep.
**Lydia**: Drop that in an email, let us know what that finished dimension will be, and we'll update our file and see if we have any issues.
**Dmiles**: Okay, perfect.
**Lydia**: Thanks for investigating.
**Mlehman**: Yep.
**Dmiles**: Other than that, that's all I have.
**Dmiles**: We're moving right along as we get closer.
**Dmiles**: Mark, as far as scheduling goes for that vav, those VAV replacements, I will let you guys know and obviously give you plenty of weeks.
**Dmiles**: Heads up.
**Dmiles**: Looking at the schedule.
**Dmiles**: Just bear with me here.
**Dmiles**: Where's our schedule at, Alex?
**Mlehman**: Oh, there it is.
**Ahuettl**: Okay.
**Lhoran**: Right where your cursor's at.
**Mlehman**: Yeah.
**Dmiles**: I think later in August, Mark, is when I have flooring slotted.
**Dmiles**: And so as far as cubicle install, we would want to get that flooring done first, and then from there they.
**Dmiles**: They can kind of have free reign.
**Dmiles**: And then we'll.
**Dmiles**: We'll remove that wall.
**Dmiles**: Will be.
**Mlehman**: The.
**Dmiles**: One of the last things that we do is removing that demising wall.
**Dmiles**: And we'll.
**Dmiles**: We'll tie all of our finishes in and like, I think I had it slated for like, one week.
**Dmiles**: We'll tie everything in.
**Dmiles**: But before that, the guys can go ahead and get in there and.
**Dmiles**: And install the.
**Dmiles**: The cubicles.
**Dmiles**: I would say this last week of.
**Dmiles**: Yeah, I would say this last week of.
**Dmiles**: Of August.
**Ahuettl**: All right, I'll just have her tentatively.
**Ahuettl**: Okay, do that.
**Ahuettl**: Does the demising wall need to come down prior to the cubicle layout?
**Dmiles**: So right now our demising wall is right here.
**Dmiles**: You want to leave that up as long as possible.
**Dmiles**: I know cubicles are like, just right around this area, the existing ones.
**Dmiles**: And so looking at the new furniture plan, I'm not sure if I have it.
**Dmiles**: I think we can leave it up.
**Dmiles**: I mean, I want to leave it up as long as possible.
**Mlehman**: Right?
**Mlehman**: Okay.
**Mlehman**: Yeah.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah, exactly.
**Dmiles**: Okay.
**Dmiles**: They'll be able to.
**Dmiles**: As long as they can fit through this entrance door, they should be okay.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah.
**Mlehman**: Yeah.
**Mlehman**: Okay.
**Ahuettl**: And then Ron Lehman from the Datacom company was checking in just to see about pulling data cable.
**Ahuettl**: At what point?
**Ahuettl**: So I think he's touching base with you guys to try and figure that timing out.
**Dmiles**: Okay, Mark, if you could share my.
**Lhoran**: Phone number with him and have him give me a call, that would be great.
**Lhoran**: I can coordinate everything.
**Mlehman**: Okay.
**Mlehman**: Okay.
**Dmiles**: Well, that's all I have.
**Dmiles**: Do you guys have any.
**Dmiles**: Any questions, comments?
**Ahuettl**: Think we do.
**Lydia**: When you send us the submittals, does it automatically in the next kind of review process?
**Lydia**: Put it to Applied Engineering?
**Dmiles**: I did not.
**Lydia**: In the workflow.
**Dmiles**: I. I did not add.
**Dmiles**: Applied into the workflow for the architectural features.
**Dmiles**: I didn't know if you guys wanted to send it to them directly if.
**Lydia**: It can go through the workflow.
**Lydia**: Ideally that keeps, I feel like us from being A paper pusher on when they review.
**Lydia**: But at the same time I don't want only for their visibility and it's up to them on if they want to, you know, receive.
**Lydia**: There's be eyeballs on each of those.
**Lydia**: So I don't have a preference.
**Lydia**: I just want to make sure that I know the workflow before it kind of goes through to everybody.
**Mlehman**: Yep.
**Dmiles**: I can get them added in this workflow here.
**Lydia**: And Mark, that's up to you all.
**Lydia**: I'm just wondering if that's something that you want to see, you know, kind of outside the MEP and things we've talked about in the past.
**Lydia**: If you want to see any of those architectural submittals.
**Ahuettl**: I was thinking we talked about.
**Lydia**: I thought we did.
**Lydia**: Yeah.
**Lydia**: I think it was casework at least.
**Lydia**: So of course we can put you with visibility onto those.
**Lydia**: And if you know you want to review, of course you can.
**Lydia**: But I think AJ if you don't mind, that just might help everybody be on the same page.
**Dmiles**: Yep, I'm happy to do that.
**Lydia**: And then when you send Those to us, A.J.
**Lydia**: what?
**Lydia**: When you plan.
**Lydia**: Kind of like timeline for the project.
**Lydia**: How.
**Lydia**: Obviously we'll do it as soon as we can.
**Lydia**: What's the turnaround time you're expecting from us?
**Mlehman**: It.
**Dmiles**: A couple days.
**Dmiles**: I mean, casework is really the pressing one.
**Mlehman**: Okay.
**Lydia**: Yeah.
**Lydia**: And like I said, we'll ordered and.
**Dmiles**: Start and started at least getting it built that way.
**Mlehman**: Yep.
**Dmiles**: You know, we're.
**Dmiles**: We're still six to seven weeks from really being ready to install it, but.
**Lydia**: No, that's fine.
**Lydia**: Typically we're like 72 hours, you know, at the most, kind of previsit stage at the most.
**Lydia**: So I just want to make sure we're kind of following what you had in mind.
**Mlehman**: Yep.
**Dmiles**: Yep, that's fine.
**Mlehman**: Okay.
**Dmiles**: Anything else, Jesse?
**Dmiles**: Dawson, you got anything?
**Ahuettl**: Oh, I'm good.
**Lhoran**: Sorry guys.
**Mlehman**: You're good.
**Dmiles**: Alrighty, guys, we'll.
**Dmiles**: We'll keep at it and look for updates from us later this week.
**Ahuettl**: Thank you, sir.
**Mlehman**: Thanks.
**Lydia**: Thank you.
**Lydia**: Thank you.
**Lhoran**: Thanks everyone.
**Lydia**: Sam.
