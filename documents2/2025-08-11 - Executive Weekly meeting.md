**Speaker 1**: I'm all good, and you?
**Bclymer**: Good.
**Bclymer**: You sound like you're under the weather.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, not under the weather.
**Speaker 1**: A little bit congested.
**Speaker 1**: So anyway, just the Colombian weather.
**Speaker 1**: You know, it's very cold these days.
**Bclymer**: Is it?
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, it's not like a very good time.
**Speaker 1**: It's very rainy all the time.

**Bclymer**: Did you send out that meeting for Jesse and I at 9:15?
**Speaker 1**: I did, yes, I did.
**Speaker 1**: 9:15 today, right?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I don't.
**Bclymer**: I don't see it on my calendar.
**Speaker 1**: One second.
**Speaker 1**: I did send that, but once again, it says something we could.
**Speaker 1**: Is going to be my health.
**Speaker 1**: It said we couldn't send your meeting.
**Speaker 1**: Why not?
**Speaker 1**: Send.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, let me know.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: You should be able to see it now.
**Bclymer**: Y.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, awesome.
**Bclymer**: All right, so for the.
**Bclymer**: For all those envelopes that you ordered, so we can't use any of those, so.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, my gosh.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, all of them got sent back to us.
**Bclymer**: So basically, like, where that window is that you can see the address.
**Bclymer**: Well, our return address is too big and too close.
**Bclymer**: And so when we mail it, the computer is reading our address and sending it to us.
**Bclymer**: So you need to order new ones and then let's just order like 250 or something.
**Bclymer**: I don't want to order another thousand and get them wrong, so.
**Bclymer**: But you gotta make sure that our return address is smaller to the top left.
**Bclymer**: It doesn't need to be big like how it is, just small and top left return address.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, perfect.
**Speaker 1**: Sounds good.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, so I'll send them all to you also just to make sure, like, those are the ones that are, you know, like the window.
**Speaker 1**: It's okay.
**Speaker 1**: I'll order them right now.
**Speaker 1**: I know from which place.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: 250 for those.

**Bclymer**: Like, I'm gonna look at it like.
**Bclymer**: But I mean, that.
**Bclymer**: That printer we have is pretty nice.
**Bclymer**: So I don't know if there's a way to, like, we just get the envelopes that, like, you know, basically go to wherever, like office, you know, whatever, and just print them ourselves, if that's easier.
**Bclymer**: But I'm just.
**Speaker 1**: What printer do you guys have?
**Bclymer**: I mean, it's like a big, nice printer.
**Bclymer**: I don't know what it is.
**Bclymer**: I mean, it's a.

**Bclymer**: It could do.
**Bclymer**: Seems like everything.
**Bclymer**: But either way, I mean, we.
**Bclymer**: It's not.
**Bclymer**: It's not like we just need to order.
**Bclymer**: You just order new ones now.
