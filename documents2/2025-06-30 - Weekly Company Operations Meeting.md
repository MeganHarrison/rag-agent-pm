**Ataylor**: You remember?
**Jdawson**: No, probably not them.
**Jdawson**: It'll be more people, it'll be ownership.
**Kmass**: Maybe.
**Jdawson**: Maybe people who like people who had taken part maybe from the city who had taken part in the project's growth.
**Jdawson**: Maybe sometimes people who finance the project and they come and they sign their name on the final beam that goes up.
**Jdawson**: So nothing, nothing for like the Chamber of Commerce or anything like that.
**Ataylor**: Just something like partners, investors, all those people, photos, investors, partners.

**Jdawson**: So nothing.
**Jdawson**: Nothing at this point.
**Jdawson**: I need to finish.
**Jdawson**: I need to get.
**Bclymer**: It's a simple question, Glenn, to say I got three subcontracts I got to write in.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I do have three.

**Bclymer**: Perfect.
**Bclymer**: Okay, well, it's not perfect, but.

**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: This is A.J.
**Ataylor**: this is.
**Ataylor**: You have something here to add, Jesse, or can just continue with the other ones?
**Bclymer**: I just continue.
**Bclymer**: I don't.
**Ataylor**: This is.
**Ataylor**: So this is Seminole Collective, this is Glenn.
**Ataylor**: Oh no, this is you, Jesse.
**Bclymer**: Sorry, yeah, that.
**Bclymer**: No updates on that.
**Ataylor**: No updates.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: For Collective, this is Brandon.
**Ataylor**: Anything about this?
**Bclymer**: So I sent him the design cost today.
**Bclymer**: I haven't heard back from Brandon whether he got him into him or not, but just the design cost on that job is almost a million and a half.
**Ataylor**: Okay, okay.
**Ataylor**: Goodwill Tremond, this is Nick.
**Gducharme**: So Brandon and Jared, they're working on finalizing the price.
**Ataylor**: This is impro Still.
**Ataylor**: This is in progress, correct, Nick.
**Ataylor**: Okay, Uniqlo, New Jersey.
**Ataylor**: This is Keba.
**Bclymer**: So Keba, where's the.
**Bclymer**: Where's your action item for that owner change order review that you're doing?
**Kmass**: Yes, I just got price you from.
**Kmass**: From Tim.
**Bclymer**: I mean like having an item in here, a task in Here.
**Bclymer**: Thought you were tracking all your tasks and notion.
**Kmass**: Yeah, I mean this one I've been working on.
**Kmass**: I didn't add it on here.
**Kmass**: You know, we had.
**Kmass**: We did have this change water for a while now.
**Kmass**: It was in there somewhere and it got completely.
**Bclymer**: I'm just saying.
**Bclymer**: We don't have to explain it.
**Bclymer**: I'm just saying if you're going to track your tasks in here, you got to put them in here.
**Bclymer**: That's all.
**Bclymer**: Just make sure they're in here.
**Kmass**: Yeah.
**Kmass**: So I'm working on a change water for this week.
**Kmass**: We don't have anyone on site.
**Kmass**: We finished a light installation and.
**Gducharme**: We.
**Kmass**: Are doing feeder installations next week.
**Kmass**: The electrician and Mike are going back there next week to get that started.
**Kmass**: And we also have a material delivered next week for all the feeders and the exit lights and some of the transformers that that were previously ordered.
**Ataylor**: Okay, thank you, Keva.
**Ataylor**: This is AJ Goodwill Foundations.
**Ataylor**: I think this is Glenn.
**Jdawson**: Foundations is moving along pretty quick.
**Jdawson**: I do need to get Dean and the design team or whoever is deciding what lights are going on in the basement to move a decision so we can get those wired up on so we paint the ceiling.
**Jdawson**: So we're working on getting that.
**Jdawson**: I don't know who's.
**Jdawson**: I don't know whose cord is it?
**Jdawson**: Is it in.
**Bclymer**: To get what now?
**Jdawson**: The light.
**Jdawson**: Those can lights in the basement.
**Bclymer**: They went back question which, which lights.
**Jdawson**: We'Re going to use.
**Bclymer**: I know but did you get a price so you know what they cost or is it in his budget and then it goes to Andrew and then he gets them approved.
**Jdawson**: I haven't gotten even what to take to Andrew to get approved.
**Bclymer**: I thought they sent you a picture of the one of those.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, they.
**Jdawson**: They did but they said those are more expensive so they need to do a photometric plan to see how many we can use.
**Jdawson**: And in that them and the design.
**Jdawson**: The lighting console and the design team I guess is that Emily maybe and deems design lighting people are have come up with a lighting strip that may work so like an LED strip that would be good for the space.
**Jdawson**: So I'm trying to get that from them to get Andrew to approve it.
**Jdawson**: But no, I don't have either of that.
**Jdawson**: Brennan is pretty hard to get a hold of these days.
**Jdawson**: We have them on a bunch of jobs he says.
**Bclymer**: So is everything roughed in for these lights?
**Bclymer**: All we had to do is put a light fixture in.
**Jdawson**: No, we don't know.
**Jdawson**: We no longer.
**Jdawson**: No, we don't know where the lights are.
**Jdawson**: Going to go.
**Bclymer**: So can you.
**Bclymer**: How much extra was it for these lights?
**Bclymer**: He's saying over what he priced for lights.
**Jdawson**: He didn't give me.
**Jdawson**: He didn't give me a price.
**Jdawson**: He just said these are more.
**Jdawson**: Because we.
**Jdawson**: We just had basic.
**Jdawson**: They just had basic recessed lights like that would go in new construction.
**Bclymer**: That's fine, but just send him a very direct email.
**Bclymer**: Say, how much were these extra?
**Bclymer**: If they are anything, is it $500, then who cares?
**Bclymer**: Just get them ordered and we'll put them in.
**Bclymer**: That's what I just.
**Bclymer**: Just say I need to know how much it is.
**Bclymer**: So maybe we're wasting our time looking for some loan else or looking for anything other than just reducing the number of lights we put in there based on your price.
**Bclymer**: So just tell them that.
**Bclymer**: Tell.
**Bclymer**: I just want to solve this and move on.
**Bclymer**: Like, we got to be done this month with that place.
**Bclymer**: So we will be.
**Bclymer**: Well, if they're a stock light, maybe.
**Bclymer**: But if they're not, like.
**Jdawson**: But the price.
**Jdawson**: The price difference is significant enough for them to.
**Bclymer**: But you don't know what it is.
**Jdawson**: I don't.
**Jdawson**: I don't know what it is.
**Bclymer**: So how do you know if it's significant is all I'm saying.
**Bclymer**: So just sending that direct email.
**Bclymer**: How much extra are these really?
**Bclymer**: If we can go back or.
**Bclymer**: Nick, did you talk about that design exterior?
**Gducharme**: Oh, yeah, yeah, we went over that.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: So that was Andrew that called when I got off the phone on the line here.
**Bclymer**: So Emily responded and said she doesn't even know anything about exteriors, so she's no help at all on that.
**Bclymer**: So we'll call up that other architect we're using, the one we used for Radial Avon, and we'll just ask them if they can help us out because we're going to give them the Noblesville project for goodwill.
**Bclymer**: So if they would just read through that.
**Bclymer**: We'll just.
**Bclymer**: Let's set up a meeting with them tomorrow, Nick, if you can.
**Bclymer**: Kev has got their contact and we'll just set a meeting up with them so we can review that, figure out what we got to do for the minimum.
**Bclymer**: Sounds like it's just a.
**Bclymer**: Maybe a couple bands of EFAs to break up that side of the building and some awnings and we'll be done.
**Bclymer**: Sorry, Maria.
**Bclymer**: Go ahead.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: This is also Keva Radio Martinsville.
**Kmass**: This one is still on hold for now.
**Bclymer**: Well, no, you got a task in here to break up the pricing, split out the data room.
**Bclymer**: Like those tasks aren't on right here either.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: Don't forget to add them, Kevin.
**Ataylor**: And then.
**Ataylor**: Okay, if it's on hold or anything, just let us know.
**Bclymer**: Well, it's on hold because we haven't got on that information.
**Bclymer**: Splitting up the data room from the fencing.
**Bclymer**: And if we got any other ideas on the fencing, if there isn't anything, we do, but maybe we break that price apart and then it becomes more manageable and they just release us.
**Bclymer**: So generator, the data room.
**Bclymer**: The data room, ac.
**Bclymer**: Like all those things need to come off and get split up.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So you need to get that done tomorrow and over to him.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: A.J.
**Bclymer**: will be back tomorrow.
**Bclymer**: At some point he can help you.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Corindel, this is AJ Radial, even.
**Ataylor**: This is Keva.
**Kmass**: Yeah.
**Kmass**: So we.
**Kmass**: We have started cutting out the doors and the electricians are also working currently.
**Kmass**: We.
**Kmass**: There's billing that we have done for.
**Kmass**: For the.
**Kmass**: One of the subcontractors.
**Kmass**: I'm currently working on contract for deem and best equipment is already on site and they have their.
**Kmass**: Their contract and they sent us billing last week and that was completed.
**Bclymer**: How you doing?
**Kmass**: I found all of these.
**Bclymer**: I don't know, it's.
**Bclymer**: Nope, they're not.
**Bclymer**: These are supposed to be forwarded.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, some things here are in progress.
**Ataylor**: Is that correct?
**Ataylor**: Still submitted process?
**Kmass**: Yeah, it's still in process.
**Kmass**: We are not really.
**Kmass**: Let me see the.
**Kmass**: Can I see from the top here?
**Kmass**: Yeah, in process.
**Ataylor**: Actually, let me change the status because we should filter only by in progress right now.
**Ataylor**: So.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: So all of these ones are in progress, correct?
**Ataylor**: Subcontract for Dean.
**Ataylor**: This is progress.
**Ataylor**: Like you mentioned, sub billing, owner billing.
**Bclymer**: We don't have a subcontract to deem yet.
**Kmass**: No, not yet.
**Bclymer**: Well, that's a problem.
**Bclymer**: So that's another one you need to prioritize.
**Kmass**: So the owner bill, you can mark.
**Kmass**: You can mark as complete.
**Bclymer**: I can just tell you some companies I've worked for, like, if you had a sub start and didn't have a subcontract written and executed, you would get fired.
**Bclymer**: So it's a big liability.
**Bclymer**: All I'm saying, I know we get busy and we have issues, but when a subs work on site, that should be our number one priority to get them a contract, get their insurance in place.
**Bclymer**: Like, do we at least get an insurance certificate from them for this project?
**Kmass**: No, not yet.
**Bclymer**: So that's a problem.
**Bclymer**: You need to get that taken care of.
**Kmass**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So make sure you're writing this down somewhere and you're putting it in here.
**Bclymer**: So that you're keeping track of these things.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: This is also you, Keva.
**Ataylor**: I know.
**Ataylor**: Jesse Signer cans up.
**Bclymer**: Andrew's revising the estimate sheet.
**Bclymer**: And then I will get that out tomorrow.
**Bclymer**: We'll send it to them and get a billing in tomorrow as well.
**Ataylor**: Tomorrow Andrew is revising the estimate sheet, you said?
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Ataylor**: Okay, perfect.
**Ataylor**: Awesome.
**Ataylor**: This is aj I think market.
**Bclymer**: It's done.
**Bclymer**: He just needs to do the billing on it.
**Ataylor**: Okay, perfect.
**Ataylor**: Aspire kzmit.
**Ataylor**: And is this unique?
**Gducharme**: Yeah, yeah.
**Gducharme**: It's in construction right now.
**Gducharme**: There's no, like, no major tasks right now.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: This is new radial Brunswick.
**Ataylor**: This is AJ + Keva.
**Ataylor**: Do you know anything about this?
**Ataylor**: Keva?
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Kmass**: Yes.
**Kmass**: We have the electrician working on site right now and we have a chain order coming up for the electrician.
**Kmass**: And next week, best equipment is going to be on site for installation of the guardrails.
**Kmass**: So I'm setting this up in job planner right now.

**Ataylor**: This is who this is probably aj.
**Bclymer**: What is that even?
**Ataylor**: I don't know.

**Ataylor**: So probably this is aj.
**Ataylor**: I'm sure he added in then.

**Gducharme**: Yeah, we want to have a number to Goodwill by the end of this week whether.
**Gducharme**: If we have to plug in some numbers.
**Gducharme**: So, yeah, by the end of this week we'll have a proposal to them.
**Ataylor**: What happened with these pictures?
**Ataylor**: Was it taken?
**Gducharme**: Yeah, that's done.
**Ataylor**: Okay, perfect.
**Ataylor**: That's good.
**Ataylor**: Now this is also AJ well, the estimator still says Andrea, Jesse.
**Ataylor**: So who is it?
**Bclymer**: I'm going to change that.
**Ataylor**: To me.
**Ataylor**: To you?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: So this is Jesse.
**Ataylor**: All right, so how do we doing with this?
**Ataylor**: 105 homes, clear water.
**Bclymer**: The estimate is done.
**Bclymer**: I finished that.
**Bclymer**: And then he.
**Bclymer**: The owner is.
**Bclymer**: See what he said here, I think said he's going to finalize the purchase July 7, and then he's going to work on his construction financing and he.
**Bclymer**: He's going to proceed with the demo.
**Bclymer**: I set him up with a couple subs to do that and then that one should go.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: And this is already done.
**Ataylor**: Go ahead.
**Ataylor**: Sorry to see.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I sent in that solar panel estimate too, but that's done.
**Ataylor**: Okay, that's good.
**Ataylor**: Okay, sounds good.
**Ataylor**: Thank you.
**Ataylor**: Jesse, this is Siva Phoenix.
**Ataylor**: This is you, Jesse.
**Bclymer**: So we've.
**Ataylor**: Waiting on licensing, right.
**Bclymer**: We've got a lot of pricing.
**Bclymer**: It's not really waiting on pricing.
**Bclymer**: So we sent them in the lighting number.
**Bclymer**: They said they would get back to us today or tomorrow if it's going to proceed with that.
**Bclymer**: But the biggest issue is the power so on a task, I need to research some more load sharing options.
**Ataylor**: How do you say that?
**Bclymer**: More load like load.
**Bclymer**: Load sharing.
**Ataylor**: Like sharing things.
**Bclymer**: Options.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: Okay, perfect.
**Ataylor**: This is you.
**Bclymer**: There's not a power in there.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, gotcha.
**Bclymer**: The other Jesse.
**Bclymer**: Do we got him in here yet?
**Ataylor**: Jesse?
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: Jesse too.
**Ataylor**: Jesse R.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, he's here.
**Ataylor**: Yes.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: You can.
**Ataylor**: And that's fine.
**Ataylor**: We need.
**Ataylor**: This is the project.
**Ataylor**: We need licensing.
**Ataylor**: Correct.
**Ataylor**: The license for.
**Gducharme**: Correct.
**Ataylor**: So this is for me license.
**Ataylor**: This is Maria.
**Ataylor**: I keep doing it every single day, but until we get it.
**Ataylor**: So this is in progress.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: This is follow up with license.
**Ataylor**: Okay, perfect.
**Ataylor**: Biolab expansion.
**Ataylor**: I think this is Nick.
**Ataylor**: Mm.
**Gducharme**: That I'm not sure what the status is.
**Gducharme**: Do you know Jesse?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So I still.
**Bclymer**: I haven't got a storm capture price, so I still need to put the estimate together.
**Bclymer**: And there's really.
**Bclymer**: There's two estimates.
**Bclymer**: There's going to be an estimate for current plan and an estimate for alternate plan.
**Bclymer**: So I just still need.
**Bclymer**: I got to get the storm capture like I got to know that their plan will work to change what's existing and then we can proceed with finishing up the pricing.
**Ataylor**: So this is get estimate still in progress.
**Ataylor**: Correct.
**Ataylor**: But this is get estimate current planned in progress.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: Then let's do the other estimate that you need to do.
**Ataylor**: So this is get estimate.
**Ataylor**: This is alternate.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Ataylor**: This is also in progress.
**Ataylor**: And this is also juicy.
**Ataylor**: And due dates.
**Ataylor**: When you think we can have those estimates?
**Ataylor**: End of next week.
**Bclymer**: I'll try the end of this week.
**Bclymer**: See?
**Ataylor**: Oh great.
**Ataylor**: Maria.
**Ataylor**: Here.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Estimate is July 3rd here.
**Ataylor**: Okay, perfect.
**Ataylor**: And this is per.
**Ataylor**: Do you want to put it high as well?
**Ataylor**: Thank you, Jesse.
**Ataylor**: And we have this one.
**Ataylor**: This is AG Vermilion rise building addition.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So they turned in an estimate.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And it then also after that you can put.
**Bclymer**: The owner asked for some alternates to be priced in.
**Bclymer**: And that estimate was also turned in, I believe.
**Bclymer**: But just write it down so I don't forget.
**Bclymer**: And yes, Brandon gets back.
**Bclymer**: He can confirm what's happening with that.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Okay, perfect.
**Bclymer**: So there's another one to add in here.
**Ataylor**: Estimate, correct?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, it's the Goodwill Decatur.
**Bclymer**: That's D E C A T U R.
**Ataylor**: Like the E C E A.
**Bclymer**: C A T U R.
**Bclymer**: Decatur.
**Bclymer**: No, you are.
**Ataylor**: Decay.
**Ataylor**: Like this.
**Ataylor**: Decatur.
**Bclymer**: Decatur.
**Ataylor**: Yes, Decatur.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So this would be.
**Bclymer**: Glenn, this is.
**Ataylor**: One second.
**Ataylor**: What is the job number?
**Bclymer**: The estimate number is 25.
**Bclymer**: 0.
**Bclymer**: 6.27.
**Ataylor**: 6.27.
**Ataylor**: And this is to do.
**Ataylor**: And this is.
**Bclymer**: This is where state it's in Indianapolis.
**Ataylor**: This is Indiana.
**Ataylor**: And then estimator is going to be.
**Ataylor**: Glenn.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, Glenn.
**Ataylor**: And the PM as well.
**Ataylor**: Glenn.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: And something that we need to add here, guys, for this project.
**Bclymer**: So we need to set up that site visit.
**Bclymer**: Andrew said he'll go whenever looks like.
**Bclymer**: If you can just reach out to.
**Bclymer**: You got Andrew's number now, right?
**Bclymer**: Glenn?
**Jdawson**: Andrew.
**Bclymer**: Andrew, yes.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, so just send him a text and say are you available tomorrow to go let us into this place and then get with.
**Bclymer**: The plumbers will just make a service ticket.
**Bclymer**: So you can just estimate that.
**Bclymer**: But if you go look at it and talk to Glenmark, because if they do the demo, they do the new ceiling and the new walls.
**Bclymer**: Look at where the lights are.
**Bclymer**: Do we even need an electrician?
**Bclymer**: I don't know.
**Bclymer**: It may be just the plumber to cap off.
**Bclymer**: And then Glenmark comes in, does the finishes.
**Bclymer**: You'll need the flooring guy to come in, fix some carpet squares.
**Bclymer**: Should be it.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Okay, guys, something else.
**Ataylor**: Other projects that we need to add, other estimates.
**Ataylor**: Don't forget to update this every day when you're working on this.
**Ataylor**: That's very, very helpful.
**Ataylor**: What else?
**Ataylor**: Something else, Jesse, we need to add.
**Bclymer**: No, I think that's it.
**Bclymer**: It's just a lot of work.
**Bclymer**: I think everyone except obviously AJ's got.
**Bclymer**: He's going on.
**Bclymer**: So we may have to pitch in and help get those buildings done.
**Ataylor**: Okay, perfect.
**Bclymer**: If you guys have questions, then the PSRs.
**Bclymer**: You need a reminder, everyone, you know, this is a short week, so getting them done by Thursday for all your projects so that we can enter that into our company wide sheet.
**Ataylor**: Okay?
**Ataylor**: Don't forget to.
**Ataylor**: Guys, if you have questions, let me know and then, yeah, keep updating this.
**Ataylor**: Thank you, Jesse.
**Bclymer**: All right, thanks.
**Ataylor**: All right, bye, guys.
