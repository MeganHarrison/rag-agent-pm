## Transcript
**Ataylor**: Yeah, look at your hair.
**Ataylor**: I don't have any hair, so I can't do that, but.
**Speaker 1**: Well, that's because I had long hair.
**Speaker 1**: Now it looks like.
**Speaker 1**: It just looks like shower hair.
**Ataylor**: Okay, let's go through this and have you emailed.
**Ataylor**: I'm going to email Brian right now just to reiterate what he's supposed to get us today, because it's not good.
**Speaker 1**: I've been texting him a bunch, and he keeps telling me he's gonna get me stuff.
**Ataylor**: So.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, it'll probably sound better coming from you, just because, you know, in his defense, like, these guys waited two months to respond to us, right?
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: And then now he's like, really?
**Speaker 1**: I'm dealing with this still two months later?
**Speaker 1**: And not to mention that we were.
**Speaker 1**: We begged everybody to.
**Speaker 1**: Then we put him on pause for six months.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: I haven't been busting his balls too much, but I know it's important.
**Speaker 1**: He knows it's important.
**Speaker 1**: All right, so this is what I have right here.
**Speaker 1**: See, it's dated 625 SA.
**Speaker 1**: All right, so I got this dated 6 25.
**Speaker 1**: That's our most recent one.
**Speaker 1**: I just need a copy and paste.
**Ataylor**: So Brian, though, like, he.
**Ataylor**: He's supposed to be sending you an updated estimate, too, though, right?
**Ataylor**: Deleting all.
**Speaker 1**: I already.
**Speaker 1**: I already.
**Speaker 1**: Well, I have it included as Alex.
**Ataylor**: You think.
**Speaker 1**: For sure?
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, we'll get him paid.
**Speaker 1**: And will you please tell him to not throw away the stuff in the.
**Speaker 1**: I'm in a meeting right now.
**Speaker 1**: I can call you in, like, 30 minutes, dude, but please call Andres and tell him not to throw the stuff away in the stairwell, okay?
**Speaker 1**: Not yet, because that's old stuff, and I think.
**Ataylor**: I don't know.
**Speaker 1**: Bill's weird, wants to save it.
**Speaker 1**: So tell him not until I have confirmation from Bill because it's like old reclaimed wood, and I don't know what.
**Ataylor**: He wants to do with it, but.
**Speaker 1**: Bill told me yesterday that he wants to remodel the whole outside of the building, which is going to be some good money for us.
**Ataylor**: So.
**Speaker 1**: Anyway, will you please call?
**Speaker 1**: I got to get this.
**Speaker 1**: I'm going through this Memphis estimate, and then I'll call you back.
**Speaker 1**: Everything good, though?
**Speaker 1**: We're rolling.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Appreciate you.
**Ataylor**: All right, bud.
**Speaker 1**: Worst time to have a child.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: Oh, yeah?
**Ataylor**: Why is that?
**Speaker 1**: We got eight little.
**Speaker 1**: Just eight of these little jobs going on right now.
**Speaker 1**: A busy summer.
**Ataylor**: Anyway.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, so do you want me to compare these side by side for you to see?
**Speaker 1**: I have updated pricing from Brian, just Not including the.
**Speaker 1**: The switch versus the at.
**Speaker 1**: He sent me his updated pricing.
**Speaker 1**: So this was our original price.
**Speaker 1**: 92347 18.
**Speaker 1**: Here's where I'm at right now.
**Speaker 1**: 8 8-44-4434 or 4,35.
**Ataylor**: Yep.
**Ataylor**: What all did you take out?
**Ataylor**: Because now we're taking all the bollards except around one generator.
**Speaker 1**: I'm going to show.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I'm going to show it to you.
**Speaker 1**: So I, I dropped generator pads down to one each.
**Ataylor**: Right.
**Speaker 1**: Still doing two transformer pads.
**Speaker 1**: I left the bollards the same and then everything else the same.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Just because this is all internal contingency.
**Speaker 1**: What's his name, Brian has all the concrete in his price.
**Ataylor**: But the number.
**Ataylor**: How much did that go down?
**Ataylor**: So when you tell Steve.
**Ataylor**: So he took out.
**Ataylor**: We took out these channel pads and ballers.
**Ataylor**: Like what, what is that savings?
**Speaker 1**: I'm going to show it to you.
**Speaker 1**: So the one on the right is our original.
**Speaker 1**: We went from 50,300 to 40,300.
**Speaker 1**: I can bring this down a little.
**Ataylor**: I'm just saying.
**Ataylor**: Does that make sense to him?
**Ataylor**: For one it's 40, for three it's 50.
**Ataylor**: Well, I mean, is this all internal contingency and the numbers.
**Speaker 1**: This is all, this is all internal.
**Speaker 1**: This is all internal contingency.
**Ataylor**: Well.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, but we're going to use a little bit of this for that concrete stoop.
**Speaker 1**: Not 20 grand, but a little bit of it for the concrete outside.
**Ataylor**: I would just tell them regardless, you know, part of this concrete we have to trench up the parking lot and get from the transformer to the ATS or service entrance disconnects, those have to go in.
**Ataylor**: So that has to be patched regardless.
**Ataylor**: So this is simply taking away the pad area and the bollards that would have gone around the other ones.
**Speaker 1**: Div 3.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, we're just.
**Speaker 1**: What do you mean?
**Speaker 1**: Will you say that again?
**Speaker 1**: Service, would you call it?
**Ataylor**: There's.
**Ataylor**: You either have to have a service rated ATS or a service rated disconnect when you feed right.
**Ataylor**: System from a transformer directly to a building.
**Ataylor**: So if you look on the electrical plan, you see all those, you know, all those condoms still go in.
**Ataylor**: All that concrete has to come out and get patched back right before it was going underneath, like the generator area.
**Ataylor**: So some of it would have been kind of already taken care of with that, right?
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, that's why I didn't touch.
**Speaker 1**: Touch it too much because I, we're going to end up using a little like.
**Ataylor**: I would bring in just under 40 though.
**Ataylor**: Like make it 38 or something here.
**Ataylor**: What if I did 50 to 30 something then?
**Ataylor**: Okay, what if I did this?
**Speaker 1**: Now we're at 38300.
**Ataylor**: There you go.
**Speaker 1**: Metals.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, so original price for metal was 222,000.
**Speaker 1**: I upped it to 322,000.
**Speaker 1**: And I'm going to tell.
**Speaker 1**: I kind of want to up it more to be honest with you.
**Ataylor**: Have you.
**Ataylor**: But you only got one number.
**Speaker 1**: I mean we just got released last.
**Speaker 1**: Last week.
**Speaker 1**: And so I knew these guys could get me a number quick and so that's why I reached out to them.
**Speaker 1**: So you see this?
**Ataylor**: What is the detail for a unit?
**Speaker 1**: I'm showing it to you.
**Speaker 1**: So I have a folder in here.
**Speaker 1**: Current pricing, reinforcement Homestead.
**Ataylor**: This Neiman foods meeting at 9.
**Speaker 1**: It's just a subcontractor meeting.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: That one don't matter.
**Speaker 1**: You don't need to be on it.
**Speaker 1**: I gotta get this kid to his.
**Speaker 1**: To Liz, to her appointment.
**Speaker 1**: This kid did his pediatrician appointment, but that's not until like 9:40.
**Speaker 1**: So we got time.
**Ataylor**: These comments Alex was talking about, the city has not to get off base here, but that sounds like some like major hurdles.
**Ataylor**: So is this like if we have a completion date whenever FedEx wants to get in?
**Ataylor**: Like who's like working with this architect to get those resolved?
**Ataylor**: Like they have no access to a dumpster like that.
**Speaker 1**: I already got it.
**Speaker 1**: Already got it.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: On it.
**Speaker 1**: Been on it.
**Speaker 1**: Was working through it last week.
**Speaker 1**: So we just got to see what they.
**Speaker 1**: What they said.
**Speaker 1**: I had two more responses to get in with the sign.
**Speaker 1**: And, and a lot of it too is FedEx hasn't.
**Speaker 1**: Why does my camera keep turning off.
**Ataylor**: It sees your face and trying to hide.
**Ataylor**: I.
**Ataylor**: I don't know.
**Ataylor**: It's stupid.
**Ataylor**: Whatever.
**Ataylor**: There you go.
**Ataylor**: Can you see your screen?
**Speaker 1**: Can you see my screen?
**Ataylor**: No.
**Ataylor**: Do you see like your little emoji now?
**Speaker 1**: Yes.
**Speaker 1**: Oh yeah.
**Speaker 1**: The long hair.
**Ataylor**: It's the.
**Speaker 1**: So we'll look at these drawings.
**Speaker 1**: So for like one new.
**Speaker 1**: I mean, yeah, he's got us going 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3.
**Ataylor**: But what is it?
**Ataylor**: Is it angle under the deck?
**Ataylor**: He doing.
**Speaker 1**: Angle angle, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
**Speaker 1**: Web diagonal.
**Speaker 1**: He's got us doing some bottom chord.
**Speaker 1**: He's got us doing the vertical.
**Ataylor**: The bottom.
**Speaker 1**: Adding a half inch solid round.
**Speaker 1**: Geez, he's gonna have to do a half inch solid.
**Ataylor**: Around.
**Speaker 1**: Half inch by 10 inch continuous plate.
**Speaker 1**: It's a lot of weight we're putting on there.
**Speaker 1**: Then he has us doing our frame for the roof.
**Speaker 1**: An Indicated reason.
**Speaker 1**: That's what D is.
**Speaker 1**: So we got to reinforce 1, 2, 3.
**Speaker 1**: So I mean it's a lot of joy.
**Ataylor**: So thank you for opportunity.
**Speaker 1**: Upon our we have an appropriate account of 135 joists.
**Ataylor**: Jesus.
**Speaker 1**: And 19 girders that are called out for reinforcement.
**Speaker 1**: 80 struts cover four struts per unit.
**Speaker 1**: Quote includes all labor and equipment required to perform the reinforcement as called out per S1 aerial list was Skyworld.
**Speaker 1**: At each location Indians will increase cost, yada yada.
**Speaker 1**: So 605 is what he gave me.
**Speaker 1**: And I'm going to be honest, I was thinking about this last night, Jesse.
**Speaker 1**: I did 200 joists in in Ulta Beauty.
**Speaker 1**: Actually more like 230 and I was like 700 grand in reinforcement.
**Speaker 1**: 800 grand.
**Speaker 1**: Now we had a lot of hurdles to hop through, but.
**Ataylor**: This 15 person crew, it's like seems a little excessive but.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I would agree.
**Ataylor**: I mean this is like a two man operation on a lift.
**Ataylor**: Maybe a guy on the ground.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, but two guys, there's a lot of wells that's going to take them a long time.
**Ataylor**: I'm just saying like.
**Ataylor**: So you're talking five lifts out there.
**Speaker 1**: Here's what Colby sent me.
**Speaker 1**: He said, AJ I was reviewing the drawing saying I was curious if you would be open to having another engineer look at the reinforcement side or if we were pretty set on this design.
**Speaker 1**: Reason asking is from the reinforcement.
**Speaker 1**: It looks like quite a bit of welding but we may be able to minimize some of this.
**Speaker 1**: Just wanted to see if we could be a little more efficient.
**Speaker 1**: Either way, Be glad to perform the project.
**Ataylor**: Ask him to send his recommendation and send it to our structural engineer and just ask him.
**Ataylor**: Hey, the guys were looking at some ve on the metal.
**Ataylor**: Does this make sense?
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, that's what I'll do.
**Speaker 1**: I told, I asked him if he wanted to meet this week and so we were gonna set up a time on Thursday or something.
**Ataylor**: We hardly have any time.
**Ataylor**: Just have him send it to you forward it.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I will div 5.
**Ataylor**: Send ve items.
**Speaker 1**: Well, that being said, look, I'm down to get back to the estimate.
**Speaker 1**: I'm at 322 even if I.
**Speaker 1**: Even if I up this right.
**Ataylor**: And the H Vac confirmed their prices has not changed pricing equipment.
**Ataylor**: Correct.
**Speaker 1**: Yep, they're ready to go.
**Ataylor**: Brian was with Mid south was saying like a lot of the commercial construction slowing down in Memphis area.
**Ataylor**: So it's a good time.
**Ataylor**: Like there's going to be a lot of people.
**Ataylor**: So that's what I Would think we can Plan Hub yet.
**Ataylor**: Like, it works awesome for financing.
**Speaker 1**: I haven't used it.
**Speaker 1**: No.
**Speaker 1**: Well, that was going to be.
**Speaker 1**: My question is like I can go get a bunch of new pricing for the steel and for the roofing.
**Ataylor**: So go on, go to.
**Ataylor**: Do you have.
**Ataylor**: Have you even open Plan Hub?
**Ataylor**: I think we used to use it a little bit.
**Speaker 1**: I haven't even seen.
**Speaker 1**: I don't even know if I have an account.
**Speaker 1**: I haven't seen any email.
**Ataylor**: I'm gonna send you.
**Ataylor**: I'm gonna send you invite.
**Ataylor**: So I mean, we sent it out in.
**Ataylor**: In for that Siva job.
**Ataylor**: And you get all kinds of.
**Ataylor**: Like even you can see if people have looked at the plans or downloaded the plans and then you reach out to them.
**Ataylor**: You can invite subs if they don't belong to Plan Hub, if you know them.
**Ataylor**: And then you put your drawings on here so you don't have to send anything out.
**Ataylor**: You just send them a link and they look at it and you get nice.
**Ataylor**: You know, you can look through and see here.
**Ataylor**: Dashboard.
**Ataylor**: Let's see, where do I add you?
**Ataylor**: Yeah, you're in here, aj.
**Speaker 1**: Am I?
**Ataylor**: Yep.
**Ataylor**: Search for an email from Plan Hub.
**Ataylor**: Can't wait for this kid to sleep here.
**Ataylor**: To post the project, just click on that button.
**Ataylor**: See where it says click here to post the project.
**Ataylor**: If you haven't signed up or have.
**Speaker 1**: You, looks like maybe Brandon and I.
**Speaker 1**: I mean, I'm just gonna guess here.
**Speaker 1**: Like a couple years ago we did a demo.
**Ataylor**: I mean, I have a free version.
**Ataylor**: It just doesn't have some of the things that this trial thing we're checking into.
**Ataylor**: Pissed.
**Speaker 1**: My camera's not working.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, look.
**Ataylor**: There you go.
**Ataylor**: That looks more like you.
**Ataylor**: If I can transition.
**Speaker 1**: Turning it off and on again.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Did you see that?
**Speaker 1**: That was my avatar.
**Speaker 1**: I don't know how to change that either.
**Speaker 1**: Saying my integrated camera isn't working.
**Ataylor**: Well, I'll.
**Speaker 1**: I will look into plan up here, but I up this to 20 grand.
**Speaker 1**: Now we're at 422 in steel.
**Speaker 1**: And my thing to him is, I don't know tariffs.
**Ataylor**: Well, it didn't raise steel that much.
**Ataylor**: Maybe 10%.
**Ataylor**: He's not going to go for that, but I think so.
**Speaker 1**: What do.
**Speaker 1**: What do we say?
**Speaker 1**: There is no way it's.
**Ataylor**: Where's the rest of our, like, what's the rest of the budget look like?
**Speaker 1**: Well, let's keep going because I haven't added mid thousand.
**Speaker 1**: I was going to do that.
**Speaker 1**: We went through it pricing on.
**Speaker 1**: On like Friday morning.
**Speaker 1**: So I I'll put this back down to 15 grand.
**Ataylor**: All right.
**Speaker 1**: Steel ball at transformers.
**Speaker 1**: That's included in mid South.
**Speaker 1**: That's an internal contingency.
**Speaker 1**: 22 grand roofing for curbs.
**Speaker 1**: I upped that from 2500.
**Speaker 1**: 3 grand a pop.
**Speaker 1**: All right.
**Speaker 1**: I got a price from our.
**Speaker 1**: Our guys doing the ceiling to cut this and do everything for, like, four grand.
**Speaker 1**: So we're well covered on all of this.
**Speaker 1**: And there's already a gate at the north fence.
**Ataylor**: So.
**Speaker 1**: So I would say 10,000 of this is already internal contingency.
**Speaker 1**: Now you got to buy the door, so maybe like, eight of it.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: All right.
**Speaker 1**: Is that easier to see for you?
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So finishes.
**Ataylor**: Whatever happened with your ceiling?
**Ataylor**: Did he just give up on trying to get a license?
**Speaker 1**: His audit is taking forever.
**Speaker 1**: We have better financials than him.
**Speaker 1**: You know, he's just a framer, so.
**Ataylor**: His number.
**Ataylor**: That's his number.
**Ataylor**: There's nothing left in ceiling.
**Speaker 1**: No, I got it here.
**Speaker 1**: I'm just gonna pull it up for you.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: So he gave me a bunch of different options.
**Speaker 1**: Like, this is the nicest option.
**Ataylor**: You.
**Speaker 1**: Know, second nicest, third nicest, fourth nicest, fifth nicest, sixth nicest.
**Speaker 1**: And then we have to add this 92 grand.
**Speaker 1**: He said he doesn't.
**Speaker 1**: He just broke the insulation out.
**Speaker 1**: But he said that's also included in all of these, so don't worry about this one.
**Ataylor**: And he's got.
**Ataylor**: Does hurt the seismic bracing and all of these.
**Speaker 1**: Yes, we do have to add the seismic.
**Speaker 1**: So here's what I got here, right?
**Speaker 1**: I.
**Speaker 1**: I plugged.
**Speaker 1**: What did I plug here?
**Speaker 1**: I plugged 7,066, 718.
**Speaker 1**: And he was.
**Speaker 1**: So I plugged this one.
**Speaker 1**: I just did the loom, like, not the shitty, shitty two because of the grid.
**Speaker 1**: I wanted, like, an aluminum cap grid, he said to go with the aluminum grid, which is this one, because it would take longer to rust.
**Speaker 1**: But I was like, dude, I don't think they're into making the building that nice.
**Ataylor**: Right?
**Ataylor**: Yeah, they don't care.
**Speaker 1**: So I.
**Speaker 1**: I went with this one, which is the aluminum cap grid and the night and the kind of nicer tile, and that was 77,700,066.
**Speaker 1**: And then I put this 92.
**Speaker 1**: Now, we originally had.
**Speaker 1**: That's where our internal contingency was.
**Speaker 1**: Sorry, I know I'm probably making you dizzy, but I'm trying to compare these side by side for you.
**Ataylor**: I thought we had extra in the ceiling before.
**Ataylor**: Now you're saying there's no.
**Speaker 1**: We did.
**Speaker 1**: So our original was a million 50.
**Speaker 1**: I took that out.
**Ataylor**: Why?
**Speaker 1**: I don't have to.
**Speaker 1**: I'm just trying to save the money.
**Ataylor**: Right.
**Ataylor**: Maybe you're taking 300,000 out of there.
**Speaker 1**: I know, but we potentially have to add a bunch more for our reinforcement.
**Speaker 1**: Now if I can get the reinforcement bought out better.
**Ataylor**: But like why not leave that?
**Ataylor**: We didn't change the ceilings, we didn't change the reinforcement.
**Ataylor**: But you like if you got 300,000 extra there now you know in metals you can go up by 50,000 or whatever and say that price of steel went up and then you got the 600,000.
**Ataylor**: If the worst case that's what it costs.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So I, I'm do some math here.
**Speaker 1**: So he was 776-7000 + 928-59, 859, 859 is Eubank's price.
**Speaker 1**: See how I do that?
**Speaker 1**: That way you can see how much contingency we have in there.
**Ataylor**: I thought you said Eubank's price was 766.
**Speaker 1**: Plus the seismic reinforcement which is 92,000.
**Ataylor**: Okay, so we only have 104.
**Ataylor**: 200.
**Ataylor**: We have 200,000 here.
**Speaker 1**: Yes.
**Ataylor**: So then if our steel is and.
**Speaker 1**: Added a hundred grand.
**Speaker 1**: Let's just see where it shakes out.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, so that covers all that fire suppression allowance.
**Speaker 1**: So I have two prices here.
**Speaker 1**: I just kept the original one because I ended up like a couple of weeks after I priced it out, I got a better price from this action fire protection and they were only 348.
**Speaker 1**: So I have 525 plug.
**Speaker 1**: These guys were 348.
**Speaker 1**: Which makes sense because if we got 130,000 square foot, you know, times five bucks a square.
**Speaker 1**: I don't know, it's a little cheap but it's a really easy system to put it.
**Ataylor**: But I would say like to me like you'd say, listen, we went back, we were able to negotiate everything to the original number.
**Ataylor**: That way we got 150 here, we got 200 in ceiling and then we just got to find the right sub to buy out the steel.
**Ataylor**: And we've got worst case 600 for steel.
**Ataylor**: And then we're not raising any of our numbers.
**Speaker 1**: So say that again.
**Speaker 1**: You think I leave.
**Ataylor**: I think we leave them all the same.
**Ataylor**: Like we're still, we picked up enough to cover anything.
**Ataylor**: The steel goes up and then we're just backing out the stuff that we're not doing electrically and concrete.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: I mean to me that makes you know, if you, if you say tariffs cause one material to go up that would Cause all the materials to go up because everything's got metal in it.
**Ataylor**: Everything's got, you know, all those things in it.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: And I mean, look here.
**Speaker 1**: Like, you know, our.
**Speaker 1**: My pricing from train is only 575,000 for curves and units.
**Speaker 1**: But we plugged, you know, 35K a unit.
**Speaker 1**: That got us to 700,000.
**Ataylor**: Where's the.
**Ataylor**: Huh, where's the 700,000 at?
**Speaker 1**: See it?
**Ataylor**: But H vac totals of 2.1 million.
**Ataylor**: I got you.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, well, we got a million and a half and.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, so we got money there.
**Speaker 1**: So we got money there.
**Speaker 1**: I'm just that, that really worried me.
**Speaker 1**: That, that, that steel pricing I got back.
**Speaker 1**: And then.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, so now Mid south number went.
**Ataylor**: Up by how much?
**Speaker 1**: I'm getting ready to show you here so we can go through it together.
**Speaker 1**: That's what he sent me on Friday.
**Ataylor**: Oops, sorry.
**Ataylor**: What did he say went up?
**Speaker 1**: He's got, he's got a total was 3 million 432.
**Speaker 1**: The new price is 3 million 5.
**Ataylor**: 41.
**Speaker 1**: So here for our primary added 25 grand.
**Speaker 1**: Can you see that?
**Speaker 1**: Electrical service from utility to the main distribution panels went up 11 grand.
**Speaker 1**: Electrical distribution panels went up, you know, 25 grand there.
**Speaker 1**: The wiring to the three generators went up 12 grand.
**Speaker 1**: You know, future gen pads and future rough ins are not included in this one.
**Speaker 1**: Power.
**Speaker 1**: Power feed to 88 circuits only.
**Ataylor**: So the wiring, he took out the wiring and it was price raised up more than any other line item.
**Speaker 1**: Which one are you looking at?
**Ataylor**: Is it the 12,000?
**Speaker 1**: The 12,000 that went.
**Speaker 1**: So he gave me.
**Speaker 1**: What I had him do is this is our original for that breakout.
**Speaker 1**: Here's what the ad is now.
**Speaker 1**: That's our new total.
**Speaker 1**: So I had him keep in there because when I spoke with him before you talked with him, Jesse, he was like, well, we have to do the transfer switches still.
**Speaker 1**: So I was like, okay, we'll just leave everything in there and I'm just going to pull out my generator costs.
**Speaker 1**: That's what this price reflects.
**Ataylor**: But he says this is just included right there.
**Ataylor**: Says wire generators, fuel, concrete pads, crane and controls.
**Ataylor**: Oh, future generator pads are not included.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, so that would have been those.
**Speaker 1**: Remember we originally had like six generators or something.
**Ataylor**: Oh, there was eight.
**Ataylor**: Then they went down to three.
**Speaker 1**: I'll show you right here.
**Speaker 1**: We went down to three.
**Speaker 1**: But yeah, we had.
**Speaker 1**: We have it.
**Speaker 1**: Availability for eight, basically.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: So now we have one.
**Speaker 1**: Now we have one.
**Ataylor**: So he can, he needs to back that out, which he's supposed to.
**Speaker 1**: We still have to have those disconnects.
**Ataylor**: Just that.
**Ataylor**: I know, but he was never providing that the ATSS were coming from.
**Ataylor**: From.
**Ataylor**: From us, from our other buddy.
**Ataylor**: So like he should be deleting those two concrete pads and the rough ends to the generator.
**Ataylor**: Right.
**Speaker 1**: Which I will.
**Speaker 1**: But.
**Speaker 1**: But that's contingency.
**Speaker 1**: And our.
**Speaker 1**: I already backed those out of our concrete price because we had doubled it.
**Speaker 1**: Doubled up.
**Speaker 1**: So that's our money.
**Ataylor**: And his electrical should have went down.
**Speaker 1**: Not with increased cost though.
**Speaker 1**: I mean all that wiring.
**Ataylor**: But he only had three generators and we took wiring two of them out of it and two of the pads out of.
**Ataylor**: Was in his price.
**Ataylor**: And all the bollards.
**Ataylor**: That was in his price.
**Ataylor**: That's why his price should go down.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I mean, I'll call him again and we'll see what he comes back with.
**Ataylor**: With what?
**Ataylor**: That's what I talked to him about yesterday about backing that out.
**Ataylor**: That's what he's supposed to be doing is sending us the price back on those other two pads, rough ins to the generator.
**Ataylor**: And then he'll give us an alternate.
**Ataylor**: If they want to get rid of the ATS, he'll provide a service rated disconnect for 8, 500 and we back up 15.
**Ataylor**: So then we'd be able to add like 14 grand in savings to whatever generator line item you currently have if they want to go that route.
**Speaker 1**: So this is from Evapar.
**Speaker 1**: So generators are 125 grand a pop.
**Speaker 1**: ATS's are 17,200.
**Speaker 1**: We had originally plugged 130 grand and 20,000.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, so you're telling me that if I bring this down to two or down to one.
**Ataylor**: We had four ATSs previously.
**Speaker 1**: Four ATSs in there.
**Speaker 1**: Basically it added internal contingency.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: And so if I bring this down to one, we still have to have those service disconnects though.
**Ataylor**: Correct.
**Ataylor**: Which Brian will give us a price for.
**Ataylor**: They're like 8,500 a piece.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, well even if we added an extra hundred grand in here, that's where we're at, basically.
**Speaker 1**: I mean I'm.
**Speaker 1**: I saved them 200 grand as of now.
**Speaker 1**: And that's with an increase in roofing and an increase in metals.
**Ataylor**: What I'm saying is if we don't decrease, you were going to decrease the other line items.
**Ataylor**: Whereas now if you leave the steel alone and don't decrease any of the line items, now you show them 300,000 savings for the generators, which makes more sense to him.
**Ataylor**: And we still, we have everything covered and a decent amount of Contingency just adding up in my head what all those numbers are.
**Ataylor**: And we're covered.
**Ataylor**: Coming higher on the steel, and we're.
**Speaker 1**: Still making, you know, 800, 900 grand.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, our GCs are covered, so.
**Speaker 1**: So you're saying.
**Speaker 1**: So my concrete went from 50 to 38.
**Speaker 1**: My metals.
**Speaker 1**: So I'll go back to my metals here and make that the original, which I think is way low, to be honest with you.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: But if I go back to my original 10,000.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: So that stays the same.
**Speaker 1**: I'll keep my roofing the same, then go back to roofing.
**Ataylor**: Did you get a price that was more than that?
**Speaker 1**: I called quality for, like, a plug number.
**Speaker 1**: No, I didn't.
**Speaker 1**: I just wanted to make us a little more money because I was worried about that steel.
**Speaker 1**: But there's no way it'd be more than 2500 bucks a roof or a unit.
**Speaker 1**: I'm doing four penetrations in Dallas, and it was like five grand.
**Speaker 1**: So what's the math there?
**Speaker 1**: That.
**Speaker 1**: That checks out.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: So back to this.
**Speaker 1**: So roofing stayed the same.
**Speaker 1**: Concrete went down.
**Speaker 1**: Metal stayed the same.
**Speaker 1**: Roofing with the same division, eight openings stayed the same.
**Speaker 1**: Finishes stayed the same with a little bit of contingency.
**Speaker 1**: Fire suppression stayed the same.
**Speaker 1**: Plumbing stayed the same.
**Speaker 1**: H vac stayed the same.
**Speaker 1**: A little bit of contingency.
**Speaker 1**: Electrical went down 300 and some odd grand.
**Speaker 1**: 320 grand.
**Ataylor**: There you go.
**Ataylor**: There's the savings.
**Ataylor**: That's what it'd be looking for.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Speaker 1**: But, yeah, I guess we'll just see what.
**Ataylor**: What we.
**Speaker 1**: We did go up in electrical, though, which makes sense in some of the wiring.
**Speaker 1**: I know you're saying there should be a savings, but right now, his original.
**Ataylor**: I know, but that's.
**Ataylor**: So that's what you tell Steve.
**Ataylor**: Like, you got 300 savings from deleting the generators and deleting the ATSs.
**Ataylor**: But it would have been more, but the price of wire has gone up 10 to 15%.
**Speaker 1**: And then whatever he goes up, like whatever we shake out with on Brian's end, we'll just cover in our internal contingency.
**Ataylor**: Well, I don't think there's.
**Ataylor**: We don't have to.
**Ataylor**: It should be what he's.
**Ataylor**: Because that 300,000 is made about the generators and ATS is coming off.
**Speaker 1**: That's just the generator.
**Speaker 1**: That's not the.
**Speaker 1**: The wiring and all that, though.
**Speaker 1**: So assuming he.
**Ataylor**: Right.
**Ataylor**: So that's what.
**Ataylor**: When he comes down off of that, his hundred thousand probably is going to go away.
**Speaker 1**: You think so?
**Ataylor**: Not all 100 of it.
**Ataylor**: But when you take out two pads and that wiring, you know, how much was he charging us for three of them.
**Speaker 1**: For three of them, he was charging us.
**Ataylor**: 395.
**Speaker 1**: 95,000.
**Speaker 1**: So, yeah, I mean, it should come down like 150, 200K extra, 100 in wiring.
**Speaker 1**: So it should go down.
**Ataylor**: So.
**Ataylor**: So if you want to just go through and summarize each of those, like on the front page, like each division, how much extra is there in there?
**Ataylor**: And then you put the negative on the steel and then you just.
**Ataylor**: You'll know right away, like internally we can cover the steel if we can't get a better price, but we know we will.
**Ataylor**: And we can give them this much cost savings in the electrical for the generators and concrete, and it doesn't affect us.
**Ataylor**: We still have half a million internal contingency and that whatever the profit is on this job.
**Speaker 1**: All right, I'll do that and then I'll send.
**Speaker 1**: I'm not going to type up a whole clarifications, but I'm going to.
**Speaker 1**: I'm going to give a summary on each line item that changes to Steve when I send this to him.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: All right, but just add those up and just text it to me or something so I can look at it.
**Speaker 1**: All right.
**Ataylor**: All right.
**Speaker 1**: Thank you, sir.
**Ataylor**: Thank you.
**Ataylor**: And I went in and I fixed a couple of the contracts with the markup for insurance and fee.
**Ataylor**: That's just something you want to make sure like Danville didn't have anything in there.
**Ataylor**: So in job planner because it's just a disaster.
**Ataylor**: It's not done and that gets hit to approved.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I.
**Speaker 1**: I'm not gonna promise a date, but before I get back Monday, I.
**Speaker 1**: Things will be.
**Speaker 1**: Will be.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: All right.
**Speaker 1**: These just all hit at once and I was focused on Avon.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Yep.
**Ataylor**: You got it.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: I'm meeting Glenn somehow knows this guy.
**Ataylor**: He's a mason.
**Ataylor**: He's been at some company for like seven years and he wants to get into superintendent.
**Ataylor**: So I'll just meet with him and see.
**Ataylor**: I don't know that, you know, obviously now it'd be nice to have another super in Indy.
**Ataylor**: Just so Alex isn't covering six jobs, but what's coming up after that.
**Ataylor**: And there's again, it's like getting someone to help out and do all these contracts and stuff for you there.
**Ataylor**: This project engineer, I.
**Ataylor**: I can do it.
**Speaker 1**: It's just like having to be on on site.
**Ataylor**: But what I'm trying to tell you though is your job then is to get more work for these so we can get the right help and then we can get more work lined up so we can just keep them busy and then you're not having to be a pm.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, I'm happy to be in, but it's just.
**Speaker 1**: I'll admit it is.
**Ataylor**: You hate it.
**Speaker 1**: It's a lot.
**Ataylor**: You hate it.
**Speaker 1**: I do.
**Ataylor**: See, so don't say you're happy to be a pm.
**Ataylor**: Be happy to get more work so that you don't have to be a pm.
**Ataylor**: So we'll hire the people as long as we keep the work coming in.
**Ataylor**: You know, that's all Brandon's fear is hiring people and having to let them go.
**Ataylor**: Right.
**Speaker 1**: Well, that's why right now you need to hold them.
**Ataylor**: So if this Memphis job goes, I have another call today with the Siva guys.
**Ataylor**: A good year.
**Ataylor**: If we get released today on that, you know, we got 20 million dollar plus worth of work.
**Ataylor**: So we'll make these hires and then.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, and I can focus more on PMing and being involved in the bigger projects than these little ones.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, or getting like, you know, you.
**Ataylor**: You think about the doctor's office there and then that, that expansion to that other building they want to do there.
**Ataylor**: Like, those are great jobs.
**Ataylor**: That would hit about the time all these guys are getting done with Westfield and things like that, so.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: I wish I could show you the video right now, but I'm.
**Speaker 1**: I'm double.
**Ataylor**: What's.
**Speaker 1**: What is this avatar that pops up.
**Ataylor**: For me like your hair?
**Speaker 1**: Oh, I wish my camera was working.
**Speaker 1**: You can see the little man right now.
**Ataylor**: Oh.
**Ataylor**: What's up with your camera?
**Speaker 1**: I don't know, but I'll see if I can get it to work later.
**Speaker 1**: I'm holding them, but.
**Speaker 1**: All right.
**Ataylor**: He's quiet.
**Ataylor**: What do you.
**Speaker 1**: He is quiet.
**Speaker 1**: I'm telling you.
**Speaker 1**: He's got his.
**Speaker 1**: He's got his nights and days mixed up right now.
**Speaker 1**: So he sleeps during the day and he's up all night.
**Ataylor**: Oh, well, keep him up.
**Speaker 1**: That's what we're trying to do.
**Speaker 1**: We're gonna take him for a walk.
**Speaker 1**: We're taking to the pediatrician here soon.
**Ataylor**: Be.
**Ataylor**: All right.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: All right, I'll talk to you later.
**Ataylor**: Yep.
**Ataylor**: Bye.
