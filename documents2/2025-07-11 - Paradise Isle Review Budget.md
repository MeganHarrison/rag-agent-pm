## Transcript
**Jremillard**: I thought of was I built this like it's all one building because I just threw the burn rate numbers in there.
**Jremillard**: That and it looks like it's just for one building and very generic.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, don't worry, I didn't.
**Bclymer**: Honestly, I've been working on this today, so.
**Jremillard**: What is that?
**Bclymer**: So I like your.
**Jremillard**: Holy shit.
**Bclymer**: Like, the overall here is good.
**Bclymer**: But I went.
**Bclymer**: And I don't know where you shared this, but I'm going to share a copy of this in the folder.
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: I just have it on the desktop for right now.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: I'm going to stick this in the folder and I'll just put like version two or something.
**Bclymer**: So what I did is I just copied your.
**Bclymer**: You could.
**Bclymer**: You had like all three years across here.
**Jremillard**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: But to total up like each year because you had like year one, two and three of all the projects, which is fine.
**Jremillard**: Oh, you want to.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, I see what you mean.
**Jremillard**: The burn.
**Bclymer**: Now we can do like a sum and then like this one here, this one is more.
**Bclymer**: I got.
**Bclymer**: Still working on 20.
**Bclymer**: 28.
**Jremillard**: It's starting in 25.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Jremillard**: What are those?
**Jremillard**: So that's phase one and two.
**Bclymer**: I put a, you know, just the design I started.
**Jremillard**: Oh, gotcha.
**Bclymer**: So just in the design team doing pre construction, I added a couple months at the beginning of each project so that we ramp up and like we were wanting to actually start.
**Bclymer**: We had them start in March.
**Bclymer**: That would be like construction start.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: I was going to ask you too.
**Jremillard**: Does your wet season play into any of this?
**Bclymer**: The what now?
**Jremillard**: Your wet season.
**Jremillard**: Like, don't you.
**Bclymer**: Nah.
**Bclymer**: You.
**Bclymer**: It's because really in Florida it's all sand, so it doesn't really matter.
**Bclymer**: The rain almost helps.
**Jremillard**: Oh, gotcha.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, I can see that.
**Bclymer**: And wet season here is afternoon thunderstorms.
**Bclymer**: So like, I don't know.
**Bclymer**: I've been building here for 10 years now, and all rain's done has mostly helped me.
**Bclymer**: A hurricane comes, you're going to lose a couple weeks, but then that's a forced de jure or whatever they call it, so.
**Bclymer**: Huh.
**Bclymer**: But what I did in here, so I took this first one and I just made it.
**Bclymer**: I just calculated it for all these and a typical Jaros get legit.
**Bclymer**: It's like an arc on a job.
**Bclymer**: You know, it starts out, you know, it just kind of goes up in the middle.
**Bclymer**: It's high.
**Bclymer**: Your buildings are high.
**Bclymer**: And then swoops back down at the end.
**Bclymer**: And then I just put basically 5% retainage at the end of the job, figuring that would Be the final draw.
**Jremillard**: These draws.
**Jremillard**: Some of these are going to be really weird though, with the things within the phase though.
**Bclymer**: Right?
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I mean this is just a high level.
**Bclymer**: Like once we dial in a schedule and we got actual activities.
**Bclymer**: But one thing, like I actually went through and broke down a job schedule and put values to everything on the schedule and it still was a big arc.
**Bclymer**: Like totally.
**Bclymer**: It's almost like.
**Bclymer**: It's almost not worth going through them all the details because it ends up being just a like going over a hill, you know?
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: They all look just the same except for a couple of them.
**Bclymer**: Right?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Like some of these, like the golf course know, I just.
**Bclymer**: It's just going to be like a slow, steady burn probably.
**Bclymer**: And that's a.
**Bclymer**: That's all.
**Bclymer**: I kept that and spread it out.
**Bclymer**: Put a little extra in the.
**Bclymer**: The middle.
**Bclymer**: Like I said.
**Bclymer**: I just have been going through here and having these auto sum.
**Bclymer**: So if they got auto sum, then I got it done down here.
**Bclymer**: But it's got to finish.
**Bclymer**: Take these out.
**Jremillard**: Oh, it's right.
**Jremillard**: I didn't.
**Jremillard**: I forgot it's Friday.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And I just messaging Brandon.
**Bclymer**: He's flying back currently, so he's not going to be able to review it till this weekend.
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So he said we'll just turn it in Monday, but that'll give us more time.
**Bclymer**: Because if you want to finish, if this makes sense to you, what I was doing, if you want to just finish this out.
**Bclymer**: Huh.
**Bclymer**: And that way we'll have just got to get the rest of these in here.
**Bclymer**: Running out of COVID Make things different.
**Bclymer**: But.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, I'll finish this out and then if you want to review anything over the weekend before Monday, that's fine.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Now we can just have our yearly billings, but then we can just total up here and have our yearly totals.
**Bclymer**: Huh.
**Bclymer**: The end here.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: Just show them where it's moving from when they give it to us to when they get the building.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: 20.
**Bclymer**: 28.
**Bclymer**: 1.
**Bclymer**: Once we get the rest of these are all.
**Bclymer**: Another job starts in 20.
**Bclymer**: 28.
**Bclymer**: This one starts 20.
**Bclymer**: Or finish it up in 29.
**Bclymer**: See, so we're at 70 million.
**Bclymer**: So we need to add another five to that one.
**Bclymer**: Approximately four.
**Bclymer**: Dark green.
**Jremillard**: Is Alito still kind of making templates for stuff like this?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I mean, we don't have anything really for this right now.
**Jremillard**: Their accountant's gonna love this.
**Bclymer**: And.
**Bclymer**: Oh, it right.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: 69.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Jremillard**: 65 million.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: A little much.
**Jremillard**: I was having trouble with my zeros last night too.
**Bclymer**: I don't have enough here.
**Bclymer**: Too many over there.
**Bclymer**: See?
**Bclymer**: Where are we at now?
**Bclymer**: So we're at 64.
**Bclymer**: 9.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, get another 10 in here.
**Bclymer**: 75 million in there.
**Bclymer**: Oh, let's go like this.
**Bclymer**: 80, 75.
**Bclymer**: 900,000 out of here.
**Bclymer**: There we go.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: 75 minutes.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: It's kind of a nice.
**Bclymer**: But we're missing something.
**Bclymer**: We got a billion dollars in costs.
**Bclymer**: We'd be here for 10 years.
**Bclymer**: So we just got to fill in the rest of it.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I guess this is the big one.
**Bclymer**: These two condos, that's 300 million of it.
**Bclymer**: We're going to need more time than that to build those monsters.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: This one's 55 million.
**Jremillard**: Were you adding that all up in your head or is there somewhere you were going back to keep referencing how you were coming up with 75 million even?
**Bclymer**: Oh.
**Bclymer**: So on the first, like, the first draw schedule, I made these all calculations.
**Jremillard**: Oh, okay.
**Bclymer**: When I look at, you know, this one, you just change the amount you put in each month so it'll populate the ones.
**Jremillard**: Cool.
**Bclymer**: That's why I'm not messing with these.
**Bclymer**: So I, you know, have references of what it should be.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, those are like your autosums, right?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So like this one or like this one here?
**Bclymer**: So this is 5.5 and equal.
**Bclymer**: It starts in 5.
**Bclymer**: 21, 29 here ends 9, 6, 30.
**Bclymer**: This one here.
**Bclymer**: This one here.
**Bclymer**: Right now there's 27 million.
**Bclymer**: So we don't have enough in there.
**Bclymer**: It starts 521.
**Bclymer**: 29 and 9, 6 of 20, 30.
**Bclymer**: Same thing with this SA.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so far, this 37 million.
**Bclymer**: I just need to bring these numbers up a bit.
**Bclymer**: So 55 million.
**Bclymer**: And the B2 just needs to be a little gradual here.
**Bclymer**: Another extra zero.
**Bclymer**: 4, 3, 2, 3.
**Bclymer**: Blah, blah, blah.
**Bclymer**: 44, 2 did I do here add 44 to 51.
**Bclymer**: So that's 7 million, basically.
**Bclymer**: 17.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: So 505 million.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Supposed to hit right there.
**Bclymer**: What the am I doing here?
**Jremillard**: Is it because that.
**Jremillard**: That row that you're on right now is an accounting format, not currency.
**Bclymer**: Oh, it's because I keep making this too many zeros.
**Bclymer**: This needs to be.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So this one here, 30 million.
**Bclymer**: This needs to be 25 million.
**Bclymer**: It's 31 SA.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: I just need take another 500,000.
**Bclymer**: This it should be.
**Bclymer**: You're getting me nervous.
**Bclymer**: I wouldn't have any problems before.
**Jremillard**: You forgot that seven on the end.
**Bclymer**: Oh, that's right there.
**Bclymer**: I'm off by 500 bucks.
**Bclymer**: Okay, now I feel better.
**Bclymer**: 500,000.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: That's the gist of it all.
**Jremillard**: It's going to be very colorful.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: I just do that more or less so I can keep straight.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: What's.
**Bclymer**: What hard enough, but.
**Jremillard**: Well, they like to see their annual burn like that anyway.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, because that's.
**Bclymer**: I mean, that's awesome.
**Bclymer**: One job with 100 mile training.
**Jremillard**: If you're talking.
**Jremillard**: I can't hear you.
**Bclymer**: No, I wasn't just looking through it here.
**Bclymer**: Oh.
**Bclymer**: So, yeah, I think we get 28, 20, 29.
**Bclymer**: Still got 1 15, 29 for this one.
**Bclymer**: 4.6, which is that little condo unit.
**Bclymer**: 32 million parts, 1, 15, 29.
**Bclymer**: It finishes 115, 29, 1,000, 530.
**Bclymer**: Take this good color here, this one, and then finishes 4, 5, 20, 30.
**Bclymer**: 30 million, 32 million total.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: @ this point, I'm just going to auto sum this One small building, SA.
**Bclymer**: All right, 32 million.
**Bclymer**: This one here, 9, 24, 29, 18, 34.7 foot storage.
**Bclymer**: SA.
**Bclymer**: This is 9, 24, 29.
**Bclymer**: It ends 4, 19 of 30.
**Bclymer**: SA.
**Bclymer**: 3 million.
**Bclymer**: 3 million will be 150,000 is all lineage.
**Bclymer**: I think we have enough money for that load storage.
**Bclymer**: What do you think, Jesse?
**Jremillard**: I mean, I think it's.
**Jremillard**: What's that?
**Jremillard**: Sorry.
**Bclymer**: It's for the dry boat storage.
**Bclymer**: I think.
**Jremillard**: I think it's slow.
**Jremillard**: That's one of the numbers I sent you in that email that I removed because it was just a breakout cost.
**Jremillard**: But yeah, that 23 million for that whole.
**Bclymer**: 22, 22 million for the boat.
**Bclymer**: Just the dry storage.
**Jremillard**: Dry storage, marina offices, marina docks, was all 20.
**Bclymer**: This 22 million or 23 million is for the marina docks and putting the seawall in, utilities in.
**Jremillard**: And then if you look on that Budget Analysis XL, the 4.7 cost of the docs is in the 4.2 cost.
**Jremillard**: So that 23,725,000, that captures five different items.
**Bclymer**: So you're thinking.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, if you scroll up on that, you'll see it right there, that green, 23725.
**Jremillard**: All those items below it, like the dry storage, there's 3.3 million.
**Jremillard**: And then the captain offices, 425k, the docks, 15 million.
**Bclymer**: But you're saying, so the dry dock, dry dock, captain's office.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So you had those taken out.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, because it's.
**Jremillard**: What it's doing is these are auto summed right here in this green 23.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And that's double adding them.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: Then if you go down to the bottom, it's double adding that 23 million.
**Jremillard**: So you just gotta either remove those cells from the formula of the autosum or just delete them because they're captured in that line above.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Well maybe.
**Bclymer**: Maybe it's design buildings got to be.
**Jremillard**: Think we should just put that dry storage at 5 million.
**Bclymer**: Yeah I would just think of the racking in there.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Slab equipment like the concrete slab will probably be a million bucks.
**Bclymer**: How many square foot was it.
**Jremillard**: The dry dock?
**Bclymer**: Yeah the the that warehouse.
**Bclymer**: Boat storage.
**Bclymer**: Did it say how many square foot it was?
**Jremillard**: What building number is the dry dock?
**Jremillard**: Boat dry storage it says is 78,000 square feet.
**Bclymer**: Slab on like an 8 inch slab on grades like 8 to 12.
**Bclymer**: Is that the average there.
**Jremillard**: For the reinforced parking deck cost?
**Bclymer**: Well this is just slab on grade.
**Bclymer**: Hope Marina.
**Jremillard**: Let me pull that up.
**Jremillard**: I think it's 10 bucks a foot.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So we'll have almost a million in the slab and foundations.
**Bclymer**: A million and a half.
**Bclymer**: At least two for the building and then all the other electrical and shit.
**Bclymer**: So yeah we'll make it five.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: And then that's going to 25425.
**Jremillard**: Okay so I updated the Excel budget analysis and then I'll just delete those out when we finalize this.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So we've got that 4.8 is off site improvements start in September of 30 it see.
**Bclymer**: Make this one another blue.
**Jremillard**: Bob Ross here.
**Bclymer**: What the heck.
**Jremillard**: Some Bob Ross.
**Bclymer**: Tell you that shit is done.
**Jremillard**: Oh okay.
**Jremillard**: I forgot it started early.
**Jremillard**: So now that.
**Jremillard**: Are we going to extend the duration then for the working days for the pre con stuff for the design.
**Jremillard**: Are we just going to leave that as is.
**Bclymer**: For the towers?
**Jremillard**: Well it's starting in August versus January.
**Jremillard**: It technically adds to the working days of the schedule.
**Jremillard**: So are we just going to exclude that pre con stuff as actual scheduled activity and just use it as cost reference.
**Bclymer**: We can update the schedule like whatever we.
**Bclymer**: Because it makes more sense to me looking at it on this.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And then go update the baseline schedule based on that.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: Because I just got the cheat sheet.
**Jremillard**: I think you kept it on here to the left of this.
**Jremillard**: So I'll just with that and then hopefully Abdul calls me back and gives me project.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: If you want to finish this up and then make any changes you want.
**Bclymer**: I'm gonna go I guess next get that meeting coming up.
**Bclymer**: But as far as.
**Bclymer**: So let's go over.
**Bclymer**: I get out of this.
**Bclymer**: But you seen where this is saved right?
**Bclymer**: Or you're in it.
**Bclymer**: I think I put it in the Backup information in the estimate folder.
**Jremillard**: Okay.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, I'll find it in there.
**Jremillard**: Documents for estimate.
**Jremillard**: I got it.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, everyone will love this.
**Jremillard**: No, yeah, this is a cool sheet.
**Bclymer**: And we just cleaned it up and we can like only put the COVID over here for, you know, the years that those jobs should be going on.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, that's.
**Jremillard**: I was, that's was part of the polishing and then only highlight the years that are actually in that grid.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah, 2029 is going to be a good year.
**Bclymer**: And really these last two, once we throw in like these, those last two big condos, this starts in 31.
**Bclymer**: And if we get the rest of this stuff built, those things gonna be worth a mint.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: If this thing goes all nice and systematic.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Just the value of everything we build is gonna level.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: And if we have the funding set up for it, we don't have to pre sell and give them away in the beginning.
**Bclymer**: These guys will make a fortune.
**Bclymer**: Well, we'll make a fortune too, but.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, and if we have the funding up front, then we don't have to worry about not paying subs on time.
**Jremillard**: And they're going to be happy as too.
**Bclymer**: Oh yeah.
**Bclymer**: Awesome pricing.
**Jremillard**: And then once we get into actually scheduling this, like I was saying yesterday, with them trying to align the mob fees because a lot of these guys, I'm assuming we're intending.
**Jremillard**: We want to keep them on site as long as possible.
**Jremillard**: Right.
**Jremillard**: Without getting them to pull off.
**Bclymer**: You know, some of them, like once they start, they won't stop.
**Bclymer**: They'll just jump from one building to the next.
**Bclymer**: We'll have to do a.
**Bclymer**: Get some logistics planning going too.
**Bclymer**: We're gonna have a trailer city that's a couple acres.
**Jremillard**: We're gonna just have to do a markup site plan for all the lay downs and people's designated areas and.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: I think they're gonna love this thing.
**Bclymer**: Okay, I'm gonna get rid of that.
**Jremillard**: Good job splitting that up.
**Jremillard**: That looks so much better.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Well, you had a good layout to start with, so then it's.
**Bclymer**: It just made it easy because I wasn't sure how we would format that so that.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I could do it.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, I agree.
**Jremillard**: I just.
**Jremillard**: That's a hard one.
**Jremillard**: Like you were saying yesterday with initially like it's gonna be a hundred columns long.
**Jremillard**: So I was trying to shrink it.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, it would have been.
**Bclymer**: You'd have been scrolling to the left.
**Bclymer**: But this makes it easy top to bottom.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, yeah, this is very easy to follow.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So if we go to 20, 25 jobs port collective drawings.
**Bclymer**: So we've had done several of these in here.
**Bclymer**: We took.
**Bclymer**: This is what I put together based on this information from the city and just let you know, the city loves, like, everything about what these guys are.
**Bclymer**: Cool.
**Bclymer**: Well, the city.
**Bclymer**: This is.
**Bclymer**: You know, when we looked up the address and it said fire department, was that address.
**Jremillard**: Part?
**Bclymer**: No, I was talking to Hoosh, the civil engineer.
**Bclymer**: Never mind.
**Bclymer**: But when I went online, because there's no address here yet.
**Bclymer**: So this.
**Bclymer**: This is that parcel where the fire department's going to put their thing.
**Bclymer**: And this is looking off into that property.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, this is that Georgia Highway 30.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: So that's where that is.
**Bclymer**: And so when we originally, before we had anyone draw anything, we just had them, you know, we just kind of overlaid the sports cop.
**Bclymer**: You can see, like, this is where the fire station's going.
**Jremillard**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Whatever this is.
**Bclymer**: Then our hotel and then our sports complex is here.
**Bclymer**: And then the city's building like this.
**Bclymer**: I don't know which building's which, but one of these is like an indoor hockey rink.
**Jremillard**: That's probably.
**Bclymer**: These are soccer fields, baseball fields.
**Jremillard**: Is this.
**Jremillard**: Are they completely separate of the build we're doing the city.
**Bclymer**: Exactly.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: They're doing their thing on that.
**Bclymer**: So, like, that's why they just want some other anchors in here.
**Bclymer**: So bringing a hotel and our thing to it and all these food courts, you know, and this is like.
**Bclymer**: I think there's an auditorium or an outdoor concert hall or some shit they're doing here too.
**Jremillard**: Oh, like an amphitheater type thing?
**Bclymer**: I believe so.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Maybe that's over here or something.
**Jremillard**: They're going to make us pay to clean that road up after everything, too.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I don't know.
**Bclymer**: I would.
**Bclymer**: You know, they're going to have to put turn lanes in all kinds of shit.
**Jremillard**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Think traffic lights and whatnot.
**Bclymer**: But that.
**Bclymer**: That'll be the city, you know, because that's there.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And I would, in my mind, they own this road coming in.
**Bclymer**: So all we got is, you know, our site work here.
**Bclymer**: Savannah Hilton headed national airports over here.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, I think I've driven right by this place.
**Bclymer**: It's awesome.
**Bclymer**: So then we had our AB do these drawings where we kind of.
**Bclymer**: We had our guy try and, you know, draw some things in here.
**Bclymer**: I don't know where the plan is, but this is what we'll talk about today is I need to send this out.
**Bclymer**: So I'm gonna take a piss and get ready for this meeting we got for the Siva.
**Bclymer**: Deal.
**Jremillard**: Good idea.
**Bclymer**: But as soon as.
**Bclymer**: As soon as that's over, let's jump back on.
**Bclymer**: We'll look at these drawings and get ready for that design kickoff meeting.
**Jremillard**: Yeah, just call me when the meeting is out.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, okay.
**Bclymer**: All right, we'll see it.
**Jremillard**: See you there.
**Jremillard**: Thanks.
