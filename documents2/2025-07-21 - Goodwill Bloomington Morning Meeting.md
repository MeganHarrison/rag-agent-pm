## Transcript
**Jcurtin**: A boat.
**Jcurtin**: Nick, you got to remember to plug in the power and turn off the batteries.
**Jcurtin**: Like, my motors barely started and the trolling motor was down like 60%.
**Jcurtin**: So we.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, sat a while.
**Jcurtin**: Charged it up before we left, but sorry about that.
**Jcurtin**: Looks like he caught some nice fish.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: You went out.
**Jdawson**: Did you go offshore?
**Jcurtin**: I lived in, I think 501.
**Jdawson**: You're breaking up, Jesse.
**Jcurtin**: I just.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, we went out.
**Ksipe**: It was fine.
**Ksipe**: Nice.
**Jcurtin**: It almost was.
**Jcurtin**: Good.
**Jdawson**: Morning, Jack.
**Ksipe**: Hey, morning, Nick.
**Jdawson**: Morning.
**Jcurtin**: Anyways, I'm taking my truck in to get fixed.
**Jcurtin**: Finally get that dent fixed, get my window motor fixed.
**Jcurtin**: I'll be in as soon as I get that done.
**Jcurtin**: How you doing, Jack?
**Ksipe**: Good, good.
**Ksipe**: How you doing?
**Ksipe**: Good.
**Jcurtin**: We got a good week, hopefully set up.
**Ksipe**: I do.
**Ksipe**: Yeah, it's looking like it.
**Ksipe**: I mean, as good as it can be.
**Ksipe**: Weather's hoping it's going to ease up as each day goes by.
**Ksipe**: There's been a lot of rain last week and over the weekend.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: Did that drain being open keep it from flooding back there?
**Ksipe**: Fortunately not.
**Ksipe**: It looks like right now looking like.
**Ksipe**: Looking at it some more and dropping some measurements.
**Ksipe**: The drain pipe that goes into the sewer drain into that inlet to the right of it, the bottom of that is actually higher than the drain that's in the apron.
**Ksipe**: And it looks like right now, whoever first designed this building, they have an exterior.
**Ksipe**: They have an exterior storm drain going to a sewer system.
**Ksipe**: So that it looks like when that inlet overflows, that.
**Ksipe**: That there is a small white PVC pipe in there.
**Ksipe**: But going from that pipe, then to the left of the apron, it actually travels downhill.
**Ksipe**: And it looks like it goes that way through that storm drain and then into that pipe that the excavators accidentally tore up.
**Ksipe**: So it looks like it actually travels.
**Ksipe**: If you're looking at the dock door standing outside, it looks like it actually.
**Ksipe**: That drain travels left.
**Jcurtin**: There's no way they would drain an outside drain under a building when you have storm right next door.
**Jcurtin**: So that doesn't make sense.
**Jcurtin**: That pipes way too thin to be anything someone put as a storm drain anyways Under a building.
**Jcurtin**: When you say it looks like it's higher, like, where are you coming up with that.
**Ksipe**: And the storm structure?
**Jcurtin**: That's to the right.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Ksipe**: When I took the grate off.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, but that thing's just full of.
**Jcurtin**: I mean, the bottom of it needs to be dug out.
**Jcurtin**: Are you telling me you're looking at concrete?
**Ksipe**: Yeah, the bottom of it was concrete.
**Jcurtin**: Go ahead.
**Jcurtin**: Why do you think it's higher?
**Ksipe**: Just with with the bottom of it.
**Ksipe**: The bottom of it is higher than where the storm drain is to the left of.
**Ksipe**: Doesn't.
**Ksipe**: It doesn't make sense.
**Jcurtin**: But it's connected to it.
**Ksipe**: Yeah, it's connected to it or no.
**Ksipe**: So it doesn't.
**Ksipe**: The whole design of it doesn't make sense to me.
**Ksipe**: So I see a PVC pipe inside the storm inlet, but then I also see that white pvc but just like a half moon of it in the exterior drain.
**Ksipe**: And then I see it again over to the left, over by the footing.
**Ksipe**: But the inlet to the right is higher.
**Jcurtin**: So at the.
**Jcurtin**: In that trans drain on the end of it, it's connected somehow to something.
**Jcurtin**: Correct.
**Jcurtin**: Like the trench.
**Jcurtin**: When you take the COVID off, you're telling me it's not connected to anything and there's no pipe coming out of it.
**Ksipe**: In the inlet again.
**Ksipe**: And to me it was.
**Ksipe**: That was the bottom of it.
**Ksipe**: Maybe it.
**Ksipe**: I don't know.
**Ksipe**: There was so much built up gravel and rock that meant that maybe that wasn't the bottom.
**Ksipe**: But I mean, it was solid.
**Ksipe**: Maybe.
**Ksipe**: I'll take a shovel to it.
**Ksipe**: I'll take a shovel to it.
**Jcurtin**: Probably hasn't been cleaned in forever.
**Jcurtin**: So it's just backing up.
**Jcurtin**: Unless you should see a smooth bottom to that thing that's got, you know, they'll slope it, put concrete in the bottom of them so that, you know, the storm pipe that comes in and out of them is flush with the bottom of the pit, the bottom of that storm structure.
**Jcurtin**: And then there should be a pipe coming from that drain right over to it.
**Jcurtin**: So you're just gonna have to get it dug out and cleaned up.
**Jcurtin**: But that needs to be resolved before we pour that back or else it's just going to flood back there.
**Ksipe**: Yeah, because that's.
**Ksipe**: That's the issue.
**Ksipe**: What we're having right now is also this.
**Ksipe**: The lowest point in the roof is back there.
**Ksipe**: So all this water that.
**Ksipe**: All this rain water that's been happening is all going to that one.
**Ksipe**: One spot.
**Ksipe**: And then the water coming off the roof.
**Ksipe**: We removed the gutters and downspouts so that the water.
**Ksipe**: So that we could demo that wall.
**Ksipe**: And then it's just coming and flowing off of that wall like a waterfall straight down into the footing.
**Ksipe**: The rain is just really tearing us up right now.
**Ksipe**: So it rained really bad Thursday night and Friday morning and just completely deteriorated his forms.
**Ksipe**: So he took all his rebar out and had to like Reese and is having to restart.
**Jcurtin**: Do you have a labor out there that you can dig this thing out.
**Jcurtin**: Figured that was.
**Jcurtin**: Did they not clean out the trench drain completely?
**Ksipe**: They did but it's still the amount of water that was coming back there because it was coming in three different directions from two spots on the roof and then the third one farther up in the apron.
**Ksipe**: It was flowing that way too and it just wasn't even the one.
**Ksipe**: The, the one on the roof is what was really.
**Jcurtin**: Is the trench drain completely cleaned out?
**Ksipe**: Yeah, but the, but the, the water on the roof is not even hitting the concrete.
**Ksipe**: It's just coming straight down and like a waterfall and just going right into the foot rain.
**Ksipe**: Looks like it's supposed to ease up soon as tomorrow.
**Jcurtin**: That storm structure cleaned out really nothing.
**Jcurtin**: Trench drain is nothing.
**Jcurtin**: It's just never been maintained and it's full of.
**Ksipe**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: So get that cleaned out.
**Jcurtin**: Gotta get a labor in there to get spent all day digging it out, cleaning it out wet.
**Jcurtin**: Maybe it'll be easier to get out of there but that needs to happen.
**Jcurtin**: And then just take pictures of everything.
**Jcurtin**: Take pictures of the drain, the COVID off.
**Jcurtin**: Take pictures of the storm structure.
**Jcurtin**: Once you clean the thing should be a pipe coming over a storm drain trench drain into that structure.
**Ksipe**: Get it figured out.
**Jcurtin**: Those, the framing all that released is Glenn Mark working on framing in those windows.
**Ksipe**: They were finishing up on the canopy.
**Ksipe**: I'll get with Greg and.
**Ksipe**: And Griffin this morning and see if they got all their framing and the engineer if engineers got back to them yet about what the design is going to be.
**Jdawson**: Oh yeah, they, they sent a price on Friday of 40 40, 000.
**Jcurtin**: Now when he initially emailed us he said this could be 15 to 20,000.
**Ksipe**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: Did he say what changed?
**Jdawson**: Initially I think he, he was planning to put it on the steel beam but to make space for the awning we, we had to raise it.
**Jdawson**: So yes, we have like structural steel at the bottom.
**Jcurtin**: Structural studs.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Because to make space for the awning.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: He can't set it on the.
**Jdawson**: On the existing beam.
**Jcurtin**: All right, that's fine.
**Jcurtin**: Well we just got to get him released.
**Jcurtin**: I talked to.
**Jcurtin**: I talked to Andrew and he said to go ahead and we'll just use whatever's contingencies left offset some of the cost of this change order and then it's just going to be what it is.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: And the EFIS guy still hasn't got back to you.
**Jdawson**: He's.
**Jdawson**: He's out of the country until next week and I guess I don't know why he can't work when he's out of the country.
**Jdawson**: But I. I've been asking them.
**Jdawson**: I'll.
**Jdawson**: I'll keep asking him.
**Jcurtin**: But they can get everything roughed in.
**Jcurtin**: We can put some plastic over the opening.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we don't need the EFIS guy until the window is installed.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: The windows are coming when.
**Jdawson**: The forest, I think.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Ksipe**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So where did.
**Jdawson**: We're gonna try to get TCO for everything other than the loading dock, I guess, is the plan.
**Jcurtin**: Good.
**Jdawson**: Then we'll.
**Jdawson**: We'll just build a temp wall around the loading dock area if we need to at the end.
**Jcurtin**: Because what is the loading dock like?
**Jcurtin**: Where is that sitting at now?
**Jdawson**: That's probably the second week of September or towards the end of the first week.
**Jdawson**: So we definitely just need to open the rest of the area and then they're going to have to move in through probably the.
**Jdawson**: The front vestibule door.
**Ksipe**: That's.
**Ksipe**: That's a.
**Ksipe**: Well, yeah, it could be.
**Ksipe**: I mean, let's say I. I'm on the schedule right now.
**Ksipe**: If I edit the form and pour new footings and make it.
**Ksipe**: I make it seven days and have him finish up inspected for it on Wednesday.
**Ksipe**: And that would make the section of loading dock the last item being painting Ballards.
**Ksipe**: That would make it September 1st.
**Jdawson**: What does it does that in?
**Jdawson**: Add in the EFIs and the paint.
**Ksipe**: The EFIs and paint.
**Ksipe**: That's without EEPHs and paint.
**Ksipe**: So that would be added in as well.
**Ksipe**: So it is looking like that first week of September.
**Jcurtin**: They would bring their stuff in through the.
**Jdawson**: It would have to be the front vestibule entrance.
**Jcurtin**: Well, what's wrong with the donation vestibule.
**Jdawson**: That they're not going to be able to fit their pallets through there?
**Jdawson**: I don't think.
**Jdawson**: Are those double doors right there, Jack?
**Jcurtin**: I mean everything's double door there, I thought.
**Ksipe**: Yeah.
**Ksipe**: The.
**Ksipe**: At the double.
**Ksipe**: At the double.
**Ksipe**: At the donation.
**Ksipe**: Underneath the canopy.
**Ksipe**: The donation entry is a double door.
**Ksipe**: Double sliding door.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So they can bring their pallets through here.
**Ksipe**: Okay.
**Ksipe**: Yeah.
**Ksipe**: And then on the side is two swinging doors.
**Jdawson**: But I don't know if they're.
**Jdawson**: Hopefully they're able to get their semi trucks right here.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Either.
**Jdawson**: Either way they're gonna have to.
**Jdawson**: One of these two.
**Jdawson**: They're gonna have.
**Ksipe**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: So when is the tco?
**Jcurtin**: When are you having that?
**Jdawson**: I guess whenever The.
**Jdawson**: The canopy is the latest item on the.
**Jdawson**: On the other areas.
**Jdawson**: Check.
**Ksipe**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: If you get the canopies and the windows done, then we completed what they had as comments on the drawings and then everything.
**Jcurtin**: If it's just that loading dock area.
**Jcurtin**: They should be fine with getting us a TCO.
**Jcurtin**: So is that mid August.
**Ksipe**: Now, as the last task in that section, I have paint.
**Ksipe**: Ballards blackout, existing striping.
**Ksipe**: Paint striping.
**Ksipe**: I have that for August 20th and August 21st.
**Jcurtin**: Okay, then that would be a good date.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jcurtin**: How's the retail looking?
**Jcurtin**: How's the retail area looking?
**Jcurtin**: Are you there?
**Jdawson**: It says he's on hold or old.
**Jdawson**: I've never seen that on.
**Jdawson**: On zoom.
**Jcurtin**: Or teams.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, it says he's on hold.
**Jcurtin**: Hello?
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, Jack.
**Ksipe**: Hey.
**Ksipe**: Sorry, I had to take that.
**Ksipe**: How's the retail looking?
**Ksipe**: Yeah, looking good.
**Ksipe**: And cash wraps are in.
**Ksipe**: That's all been trimmed out.
**Ksipe**: They came and did.
**Ksipe**: Griffin already did his drywall touch up.
**Ksipe**: The painters did their contract GC touch up, and all that's left for them in the sales floor is eventually to do their owner touch up.
**Ksipe**: But, yeah, sales floor is.
**Jcurtin**: What do you mean, owner touch up?
**Ksipe**: Like, if the owner came in with anything and, like, to put on the walls, and then they scrape them.
**Ksipe**: If goodwill has any stuff that they want to put on the walls on the east and west, and they end up scuffing up some paint in line.
**Ksipe**: Does have another owner's touch up on their.
**Ksipe**: On their contract.
**Ksipe**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: Do you have everything you need, Jack?
**Jdawson**: You need any information from me or.
**Ksipe**: Yeah, the awning company, they did confirm, right, that.
**Ksipe**: That.
**Ksipe**: That it is one foot.
**Ksipe**: Yeah, they confirm.
**Ksipe**: So other than that, no rain.
**Ksipe**: Looks like it's going to ease up tomorrow.
**Ksipe**: So that means quality roofing will still show up and start on the canopy, and then also we'll get Rick out here and.
**Jcurtin**: Yep.
**Ksipe**: So no, that's all I got for right now.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Looks like those.
**Jdawson**: Those metal awnings are $37,000.
**Jcurtin**: Really?
**Jcurtin**: And the clock funds were that much?
**Jdawson**: I think they were under 20.
**Jcurtin**: Okay, well, just.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we'll give them the option, I guess.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Ksipe**: Okay.
**Ksipe**: All right.
**Jdawson**: I'll talk to you guys later.
**Jcurtin**: All right, See you.
**Ksipe**: All right, thanks.
**Ksipe**: Y' all have a good week.
**Jdawson**: See you.
**Ksipe**: Sa.
