## Transcript
**Jdawson**: There sir.
**Speaker 1**: How you doing Justin?
**Speaker 1**: Thought I was late for a second there.
**Jdawson**: Oh you're good.
**Jdawson**: It's all.
**Jdawson**: All just fine.
**Jdawson**: How's your Friday?
**Speaker 1**: But it's good.
**Speaker 1**: Busy but knocking some stuff out here.
**Jdawson**: Good, good, good.
**Jdawson**: All right, well busy.
**Jdawson**: Let me jump on over to this thing here.
**Jdawson**: And you've got.
**Jdawson**: You've got structural.
**Speaker 1**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: And I've got here MEP low voltage and interiors.
**Jdawson**: So that in the interiors would be for the lobby spaces the all the hotel room guest rooms, common areas similar for the condos and then the restaurant up on the roof level.
**Jdawson**: So we'll just scroll the up front is all the same same.
**Jdawson**: You know this process take that on through.
**Jdawson**: So here is the meat potatoes outlining the project understanding.
**Jdawson**: So again we're going with based on our last conversation with the structural where we're going to a five story mixed use where we've got the hotel lobby, back of house space, guest rooms on the first floor.
**Jdawson**: Continuing with the guest rooms on the second floor.
**Jdawson**: Targeting that 50 units and then floors three and four.
**Jdawson**: Go ahead.
**Speaker 1**: Is it.
**Speaker 1**: Is this anything to do?
**Speaker 1**: This also includes like.
**Speaker 1**: Or there's really.
**Speaker 1**: You don't think there's anything to do with or we were going to hold off on anything on the container yard or we don't think it would.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, so we're going to hold off on that.
**Jdawson**: We can.
**Jdawson**: We would create a separate one anyway if we.
**Jdawson**: If we did another scope.
**Jdawson**: So it'd be a separate proposal.
**Jdawson**: So for right now this is just the, the hotel condo and restaurant up on the top with the pool.
**Speaker 1**: I was thinking if it's anything it might be just like the entrances where we stack some containers and then you know, show them how they.
**Speaker 1**: Some lights or whatever paint colors that the containers would be.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah, I can do another one of those.
**Jdawson**: And that would be just off.
**Speaker 1**: Roughly how much extra would that be?
**Jdawson**: Probably be.
**Jdawson**: I mean let me pull up, let me get through this and I can pull up what I did on the other.
**Jdawson**: Yeah the other one.
**Jdawson**: And I probably follow suit with.
**Jdawson**: With a lot of those.
**Jdawson**: All right, so we've got two elevators.
**Jdawson**: No, no trash, no linen.
**Jdawson**: We're looking at concrete floors supported either the metal frame or something similar maybe cmu.
**Jdawson**: So that's kind of what our assumptions are for the project.
**Jdawson**: Using that almost 12,000 square foot footprint as.
**Jdawson**: As a base and it.
**Jdawson**: If we move it around the site or change shape a little bit, it's not.
**Jdawson**: Not a big deal.
**Jdawson**: Okay so we have here mechanical, electrical, plumbing, fire protection, low voltage Interior design.
**Jdawson**: I will send you when I send this.
**Jdawson**: I also have two bids for the waterproofing billing envelope.
**Jdawson**: So one is ECS Limited and the other one is Nova Engineering.
**Jdawson**: Are you familiar with either one of those?
**Speaker 1**: They don't sound familiar, but okay.
**Jdawson**: So they, we've used Nova on, on many projects for waterproofing.
**Jdawson**: They've always done well ecs.
**Jdawson**: We, we have not done as much with them.
**Jdawson**: We're actually doing their office renovation right now in addition, and they are also, they do work in Georgia, so it made sense.
**Jdawson**: They both do materials testing, they can both do private provider code reviews.
**Jdawson**: So they're very similar.
**Jdawson**: You'll notice in the ECS package they give a little bit more in terms of types of testing that they can do for like the roof and water tightness and different things.
**Jdawson**: And their, their fee is a little lower as well.
**Jdawson**: So I was leaning towards ECs, but they're both, both good groups.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so here, going forward and I'll scroll down to the interior design outline at the end that I put on in the back.
**Jdawson**: I just, I didn't want to just put all of that in here is just a lot and you can see it, they break it out pretty, pretty clearly between all of the different uses and functions of space and what they're providing for each.
**Jdawson**: And so we, we can get really clear on that and can make any adjustments we need to going forward.
**Jdawson**: Of course we'll need, you know, the boundary and CAD if there's any environmental or tree issues because it looks like it's all a wooded site right now.
**Jdawson**: But it might be a lot of pines.
**Jdawson**: So you may not have oak trees to contend with, which would be a good thing.
**Jdawson**: But then yeah, ultimately we'll need the Geotech fire hydrant flow test.
**Jdawson**: Just confirming that, you know, the standard of the reverb in terms of queen, queen rooms, king room suites, what's really needed desired there so that we can move forward with the layout on that.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, but most of us pretty self explanatory.
**Jdawson**: If there are packages of appliances that you know are desired, we can, we can incorporate that up front.
**Jdawson**: So yeah, schematic design.
**Jdawson**: Design development.
**Jdawson**: We're anticipating maybe 12 design review meetings with the client throughout the process.
**Jdawson**: Figuring maybe a 6ish month design timeline depending on how long it takes to go back and forth on schematic and getting that settled and then probably a couple months for DD and a couple months for cd.
**Jdawson**: So that's just kind of where we were thinking so meeting maybe every other week as we Start digging into this.
**Jdawson**: Our goal would be for the DD set to be something that could be a milestone pricing set as well.
**Jdawson**: So you can get pretty clear on that as we move into cd.
**Jdawson**: So if we need to pivot on anything before we fully and finally detail everything, we can do that.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: On the CDs.
**Jdawson**: Just so I'll clarify this here.
**Jdawson**: Revit Bim, which is the program we design in LOD level of detail 300.
**Jdawson**: All that is is that's industry standard.
**Jdawson**: Really.
**Jdawson**: That's your everything that you would need to put the building together.
**Jdawson**: The only reason that's added here is so that there's clarification because you can use Revit and BIM to go super detailed to where you could use it and run takeoff reports for all kinds of materials and outlets and switches and baseboard.
**Jdawson**: And we just don't use it to that nth degree.
**Jdawson**: And it's not typical to do that for the level of modeling and production and everything that we do typically.
**Jdawson**: So that's just for clarification as well.
**Speaker 1**: But this.
**Speaker 1**: We're gonna have like the MEPs loaded into this thing.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, MEP will be loaded structural be in there.
**Jdawson**: We can still do clash to clash detection and all of that.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So it's.
**Jdawson**: It's like I said, it's industry standard.
**Jdawson**: It's everything we normally do and everything you're used to seeing.
**Speaker 1**: We mostly.
**Speaker 1**: Do you think you need to confirm anything with Ste or Steve, the structural engineer or.
**Speaker 1**: He's got what he needs.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, he's gonna have what he needs.
**Jdawson**: I.
**Jdawson**: I'd be really surprised if he went any further than that.
**Speaker 1**: I mean it doesn't matter what he designs using with.
**Speaker 1**: I don't know if it's industry standard, but anything he does will work with what you're doing.
**Speaker 1**: Because I.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, yeah.
**Speaker 1**: He's like.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, maybe it's the civil guy is always that's they can't implement into your model.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, usually we're a little separate there.
**Jdawson**: Do you know if Steve is doing the 3D?
**Jdawson**: Is he in.
**Jdawson**: In Revit?
**Jdawson**: Most people are.
**Jdawson**: We can still work around it either way.
**Jdawson**: It's certainly easier if we can all play in the same sandbox, so to speak.
**Speaker 1**: Let me text him right now and just maybe he'll answer.
**Speaker 1**: Click.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so.
**Jdawson**: And we can talk talk this through on ca.
**Jdawson**: So we.
**Jdawson**: We built in like a lump for each site visit that would be needed or requested really.
**Jdawson**: And then otherwise we're.
**Jdawson**: We're doing the typical like BI weekly OAC phone calls, RFIs submittals, that kind of thing.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So I don't have any site visits baked in to the architectural per se, but we can always, you know, we can walk that through.
**Jdawson**: I'm seeing a lot of complexity in this building with the, the changing of floor plate, floor types of usage between the hotel and the condos.
**Jdawson**: And then of course, that the most complicated, complex portion of this is that rooftop.
**Jdawson**: Rooftop pool, rooftop restaurant and bar.
**Jdawson**: All that together.
**Jdawson**: There may be some need to get out there, but we could also handle as much as we can through video calls and pictures and things like that too.
**Jdawson**: So there's always that.
**Jdawson**: That option.
**Speaker 1**: Yep.
**Speaker 1**: I think we'll try to set up the.
**Speaker 1**: Can't think what they call it, but it's.
**Speaker 1**: I don't know if we use it at Marina Bay, but it's where you wear that helmet360 camera.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, and guys will walk the site and I.
**Speaker 1**: It's.
**Speaker 1**: It's unbelievable.
**Jdawson**: Wow.
**Speaker 1**: Because.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, you know, we, we have them walk the entire site like once a week minimum.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: And then you can click on, you know, it.
**Speaker 1**: It transfers that path onto the, the plan.
**Speaker 1**: Multiple floors or whatever.
**Speaker 1**: And then you can go anywhere and just look.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, good.
**Jdawson**: I'm glad you got that.
**Jdawson**: We actually just started using.
**Jdawson**: There's a guy, vectornet.
**Jdawson**: I don't know if you've heard of them.
**Jdawson**: So they're another kind of group.
**Jdawson**: They go through and they'll scan.
**Jdawson**: So we've got two renovation projects we're working on.
**Jdawson**: One is a twin tower condo in, in Clearwater.
**Jdawson**: It's a renovation because of the storm.
**Jdawson**: Another one's an office.
**Jdawson**: And so they went through and they scanned it all with their little, like you said, helmet thing that they wear.
**Jdawson**: And then not only did they give a revit model for us to start with as in existing conditions, but then they also had the pictures and they had.
**Jdawson**: It was set up.
**Jdawson**: It was a viewer, but it was set up almost like your own little Google Earth kind of thing.
**Jdawson**: Like you just click on the path where you go and walk around through.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that's right.
**Speaker 1**: That's how it works.
**Jdawson**: Okay, cool.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I'm glad you got that.
**Jdawson**: That's.
**Jdawson**: That's been super helpful.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: We found like when you're roughing things in, you know, drywallers are always gonna hang over something and then you just go to that capture that was done before they hung it.
**Speaker 1**: You can see where the, you know, the outlets erupt in or.
**Jdawson**: Oh, nice.
**Speaker 1**: Something needs to be added later.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: You're not just cutting blindly Into a wall.
**Speaker 1**: I mean it's, it's pretty awesome.
**Jdawson**: So that's awesome.
**Jdawson**: Very cool.
**Jdawson**: Very cool.
**Jdawson**: Good.
**Jdawson**: So does all this seem pretty much like what we talked about?
**Jdawson**: Are we on the same page with program and everything?
**Jdawson**: All right, cool.
**Jdawson**: So this is where we ended up.
**Jdawson**: So broke out by discipline across the top and phases along the left side.
**Jdawson**: So MEP and Low Voltage, they are ingenuity.
**Jdawson**: Have you worked with them before?
**Jdawson**: They're based in Orlando, but we're actually doing a vertical mixed use project right now in Connorton, which is like Lando Lakes area.
**Jdawson**: And they've been really good to work with.
**Jdawson**: Really responsive.
**Jdawson**: And so we've got them on here for the mep that should say mepf.
**Jdawson**: They are doing the fire protection too.
**Jdawson**: It's in the verbiage and input it here, but the same thing.
**Jdawson**: And then interior design.
**Jdawson**: Jackie Arena Interiors.
**Jdawson**: We're working on a couple projects with them right now.
**Jdawson**: Heavy in the hospitality.
**Jdawson**: So she'd work really well with the, the hotel with all the rooms, the guest rooms, the common areas and the restaurant.
**Jdawson**: And then she'd be able to fold, I think just with all that brand idea into the condo really pretty easily.
**Jdawson**: I think that should be pretty straightforward.
**Jdawson**: She does have.
**Jdawson**: So she was asking if all of the units and interior finishes would be brand standard or if they would be something totally custom.
**Jdawson**: Not knowing really the direction we're going to go right now.
**Jdawson**: The number you see above for her is the like custom number which is higher of course.
**Jdawson**: So if we were to go to a brand standard for the rooms in common areas, it's a reduction of about 16 grand off of her fee.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, and is this like standard?
**Speaker 1**: Obviously I've never designed and built a hotel before, but is this going to be pretty industry standard, you think, from this hotel?
**Speaker 1**: Well, from a design cost.
**Jdawson**: There'S, there's of course the complications.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: The complexities of this one.
**Jdawson**: If it were totally just, you know, roadside flag, that's straightforward prototype copy paste down and you're just doing some minor changes to the site.
**Jdawson**: It would be of course less than this.
**Jdawson**: The, the added cost here is the condo.
**Jdawson**: Not only from now you've got an added use, but also the added liability.
**Jdawson**: And then the, I don't know, five, six thousand square foot restaurant up on top with bar and pool and all of that.
**Jdawson**: So there's, there's a lot that goes into that and I think that drove everybody's numbers, you know, that the, the pool and the, in the restaurant and all of that in the condo.
**Speaker 1**: What do you think that.
**Speaker 1**: So the condo added how much?
**Speaker 1**: I just want generalities here, you know, when we can, you know, discuss, you know, where these like what.
**Speaker 1**: What's driving up the cost.
**Speaker 1**: So that would.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jdawson**: So I think probably.
**Speaker 1**: I'm sorry, I've been trying to call this guy all day long.
**Speaker 1**: Justin.
**Jdawson**: Oh, you're fine.
**Jdawson**: Go ahead and grab it.
**Speaker 1**: One second, one second.
**Jdawson**: Sure.
**Jdawson**: Hey, Brennan.
**Speaker 1**: All right.
**Speaker 1**: Sorry about that.
**Speaker 1**: So I, I was giving you time to ponder about what this upcharge is like.
**Speaker 1**: You're muted, Justin.
**Jdawson**: That's awful.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: I think the condos, the ten condos were somewhere with about a hundred and twenty ish add architecturally.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And then let me scroll down here to the.
**Jdawson**: The MEPs did not break it out this way.
**Jdawson**: I need to, I need to get with them specifically.
**Jdawson**: But here you see how everything was broken out for.
**Jdawson**: This is the interior lady.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, condominium units, kitchen, bath, dining, living bed, laundry, closets, elevator, lobbies, corridors, mail.
**Jdawson**: 24 grand for her.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And then I can, I can get it with.
**Speaker 1**: Like if, if I look at your pricing, like the 120 and the 24, that pretty much a percentage that's similar.
**Speaker 1**: It's probably the same with mechanical.
**Jdawson**: I don't know.
**Jdawson**: Let me see if I can't get.
**Speaker 1**: Him to respond to 120.
**Speaker 1**: That's like 25% for her.
**Speaker 1**: 24 is 20%.
**Speaker 1**: Roughly.
**Jdawson**: I'll see what he comes back with.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I mean that's kind of like the restaurant standing.
**Speaker 1**: Like a standalone restaurant would cost.
**Speaker 1**: I don't know what that design would be.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, again, let's.
**Jdawson**: I mean if we go to.
**Jdawson**: From an interior standpoint, the rooftop restaurant was seating for 150 at 30 to 40 square foot per seat to include the bar, kitchen and back of house, which is probably about right.
**Jdawson**: So she's got 50 in there for.
**Jdawson**: For that and I think probably be in that.
**Jdawson**: I mean this wouldn't be exactly for a standalone because it's kind of integrated with other things.
**Jdawson**: But we were.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we're around the 70 mark for a restaurant.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we would also.
**Jdawson**: Which.
**Jdawson**: Which isn't here.
**Jdawson**: Not knowing which direction we were going to go, but.
**Jdawson**: Oh, that's right.
**Jdawson**: You're going to have.
**Jdawson**: You had the kitchen consultant.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: You had to catch a console that was going to be part of that.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: And for the, like the pool and all that.
**Speaker 1**: That's.
**Speaker 1**: They would have a pool anyways.
**Speaker 1**: It probably would be just.
**Jdawson**: Well, again, if it's on Grade versus structured.
**Jdawson**: That's.
**Jdawson**: It's just a significant change in, you know, what.
**Jdawson**: What.
**Jdawson**: The level of detail and coordination and.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Liability.
**Jdawson**: Just all of that, you know, waterproofing, coordination.
**Jdawson**: So you've got that factored in here everywhere, too.
**Speaker 1**: So tile instead of just a deck coating.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: All of that.
**Jdawson**: Or, you know, pavers on grade versus.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, all of that.
**Jdawson**: So, yeah, there's.
**Jdawson**: There's a lot of fun things.
**Jdawson**: It'd be an awesome project.
**Jdawson**: There's just the time and everything to get into it.
**Jdawson**: I mean, I was looking at some of the reverb products online, and they're pretty sweet, man.
**Jdawson**: Like, really?
**Speaker 1**: Can you pull one up on your computer?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, let me.
**Jdawson**: You don't want to cut it short for, you know, if you're going to do it, do it right kind of thing.
**Jdawson**: Like.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: First we get ads.
**Speaker 1**: See?
**Jdawson**: Come on.
**Jdawson**: Of course, it was the.
**Speaker 1**: Hold on.
**Jdawson**: There you go.
**Jdawson**: There.
**Jdawson**: So that kind of a look.
**Speaker 1**: Pretty.
**Jdawson**: Pretty sweet.
**Jdawson**: Then they had.
**Jdawson**: I thought it was interesting.
**Jdawson**: Where did it go?
**Jdawson**: Lenny Kravitz.
**Jdawson**: No, Lenny Kravitz.
**Jdawson**: He's got his own interior design firm.
**Speaker 1**: Dang.
**Speaker 1**: Rooftop bar.
**Jdawson**: Travis Design.
**Speaker 1**: Wow.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, this is the same thing.
**Speaker 1**: So it's got a rooftop bar.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So this one, though.
**Jdawson**: I mean, this too.
**Jdawson**: The.
**Jdawson**: The construction cost was.
**Jdawson**: You have a lot more units.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: You got a 240, 280 apartment plus 125.
**Speaker 1**: Hotel.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, but they were.
**Jdawson**: And then they had some live, local stuff.
**Jdawson**: They had some affordable units built in there.
**Speaker 1**: How much were they paying for that thing?
**Jdawson**: I saw it in here.
**Speaker 1**: 150 million.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Yep, yep.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: We're not there, so.
**Jdawson**: Spend at least 55 million on design and construction.
**Jdawson**: Developer Safe project will be closer to 100.
**Jdawson**: That's quite a swag right there.
**Jdawson**: 55 to 150.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, that's a good.
**Jdawson**: That's a big swag.
**Speaker 1**: Well, but between the two, there's like 400 units.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, right, right, right.
**Jdawson**: So then here's another, you know, so there.
**Jdawson**: It's a reverb.
**Speaker 1**: This thing's going to be badass.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, so I would just say, like, if you're going to do it, do it right and help them figure out how to get it to work, you know.
**Speaker 1**: Well, if we need to spend another 10 million, then we'll spend another 10 million.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, but.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, so that's.
**Jdawson**: That's kind of.
**Speaker 1**: I like that one with the different color.
**Speaker 1**: Is it the lights doing that or is that the panels?
**Jdawson**: Think up at the top, there was.
**Speaker 1**: One on the right here.
**Speaker 1**: That one?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah, yeah, that one that looks like it's.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, some lights coming back and shining on that and then some kind of LED panel or something.
**Speaker 1**: That is tight.
**Speaker 1**: You can see the rooftop kind of.
**Jdawson**: Oh, yeah, you got something happening up there?
**Jdawson**: See if we can figure this out.
**Jdawson**: Oh, they always get you.
**Jdawson**: Come on.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Speaker 1**: I know.
**Jdawson**: Trial.
**Jdawson**: Well, ah, whatever.
**Jdawson**: Okay, well, you get the idea.
**Speaker 1**: Exactly.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: That's pretty sweet.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So there's.
**Jdawson**: There's some really cool stuff that we can do, I think.
**Jdawson**: I think the interiors group is a good group.
**Jdawson**: I think they'll be able to give you a really good design on the interior.
**Jdawson**: The MEP's strong and responsive, so.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I mean, I feel good about it overall, but.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, just let us know where we're at.
**Jdawson**: There's.
**Jdawson**: There's a lot of moving parts, a lot of overlay.
**Jdawson**: You're gonna make sure that it's all talking together.
**Speaker 1**: I just want to.
**Speaker 1**: I'm just asking for all that because they want to have kind of a breakdown of like where this cost is all coming from.
**Speaker 1**: I got everyone else's now, so I can throw it all together.
**Speaker 1**: And then we were going to look at the.
**Speaker 1**: The container yard, so.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, we see.
**Jdawson**: So if we're going to.
**Jdawson**: So what do we.
**Jdawson**: Just the entry pylons.
**Speaker 1**: So.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, the entry would be like, containers, I think.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Signs on them and then, you know, the.
**Speaker 1**: Just the paint scheme for the containers.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So we did.
**Jdawson**: I had almost 12 grand in there for kind of a schematic exterior color, you know, looking at all the pods and things like that.
**Jdawson**: And then I had probably be similar for two pylon features.
**Jdawson**: And then we developed a schematic and coordinate that with, you know, the actual fabricator and what's needed there.
**Jdawson**: A lot of that probably tie into civil, you know, in terms of power.
**Jdawson**: So I would say maybe we.
**Jdawson**: I don't.
**Jdawson**: I don't know how much we'd need from our.
**Jdawson**: From our mep, I guess, is what I'm saying.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I think we'll try to do.
**Speaker 1**: Try to do.
**Speaker 1**: I know the containers.
**Speaker 1**: I just.
**Speaker 1**: I haven't had time to negotiate with them because I.
**Speaker 1**: You know, we've got several companies looking at providing, like, turnkey where they're built.
**Speaker 1**: They ship them there and then all we do is, you know, hook them up.
**Speaker 1**: Because I think in Georgia they probably let us do that versus Florida's a little.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: A little more picky on that.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: But they were coming in with crazy numbers for, you Know the ones that are licensed to build them and they're inspected, ready to go.
**Speaker 1**: They're like $440 a square foot, which is crazy.
**Speaker 1**: Like I could build them for half of that or less.
**Speaker 1**: Like why, why would I do that?
**Speaker 1**: So.
**Jdawson**: Okay, yeah, I mean that's I guess a.
**Jdawson**: A good starting point.
**Jdawson**: Is there anything else out on the site that you need us to look at versus what you're getting done?
**Speaker 1**: No, I think, I think I have everything.
**Speaker 1**: It's civil structural landscaping.
**Speaker 1**: Now you got all the MEPs architectural design.
**Speaker 1**: The waterproofing will be.
**Speaker 1**: You're going to send that to me.
**Speaker 1**: So I.
**Speaker 1**: Yep.
**Speaker 1**: Just have that number in there.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, you'll have the two to look at.
**Jdawson**: I can, I can pull them up real quick if you want.
**Jdawson**: Still look at them.
**Jdawson**: So this is ecs.
**Jdawson**: They do, they do, I think they do geo, they do soils, they do material testing, they do waterproofing, code review and locally here too.
**Jdawson**: If you are looking for a code reviewer.
**Jdawson**: They recently actually brought on the former fire marshal reviewer from the city of Tampa onto their staff.
**Jdawson**: So he's a, he's a real asset if you need something.
**Jdawson**: So these guys and they made it out to me, but we can fix names and whatever for whoever's selected.
**Jdawson**: So basically they'll go through the design phase, building envelope, document constructability reviews.
**Jdawson**: They'll go through really all the details, give some direction on materials and systems and interfacing and overlaps and how it all comes together.
**Jdawson**: The scope is the same for both, both groups.
**Jdawson**: Construction phase.
**Jdawson**: And they would do consulting, testing, pre construction reviews, quality assurance reviews.
**Jdawson**: And then they can also do, they'll do submittal reviews, mock up, they can do a mock up test review, field testing, a bunch of different things.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, they've got a lot.
**Jdawson**: These guys have more testing than the other ones.
**Jdawson**: They, the other one may be able to do it, but they didn't, they didn't, didn't put it on here.
**Jdawson**: Infrared aluminum window, like all, all kinds of stuff.
**Jdawson**: It's like four pages of tests that they can do.
**Jdawson**: Which when you're talking pool over a condo is probably a good, good move.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, for sure.
**Jdawson**: So this is where they came in.
**Jdawson**: So for the billing envelope review, 4,500 and then they have remote meeting in there.
**Jdawson**: They've got shot drawing, review and then just some of their management time.
**Jdawson**: So that's kind of the front end stuff about 11 grand.
**Jdawson**: And then the field services is where all the rest of this comes in.
**Jdawson**: So that's your pre construction on Site meeting reviewing with all of the subs looking at the mock up, they've got 10 site visits at 2500 each built in of just estimate, you know, maybe they don't need that many window test, roof tests, storefront tests.
**Jdawson**: So that came in altogether 66, 800.
**Jdawson**: So I think that's a little money well spent, honestly.
**Jdawson**: And maybe you don't need all these tests and maybe, I don't know, maybe they'll need as many observations.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, but like the testing, a lot of that, you know, looked our window guy, they have their own test systems they can set up.
**Jdawson**: They could do that, right?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So that's these guys and then Nova is the other one.
**Jdawson**: Pretty, pretty similar in terms of they're going to do the document review.
**Jdawson**: They'll give advice on those kind of things.
**Jdawson**: Shop drawing, submittal reviews.
**Jdawson**: They have a general number in here for just general consulting in terms of discussion and talking about systems and best practices.
**Jdawson**: And then they also have field observation reports.
**Jdawson**: They've got 20 built in.
**Jdawson**: They've got so many site visits built in again, more field test penetration, rack and chamber testing, spray nozzle, electronic test, leak detection and so forth.
**Jdawson**: So these guys come in higher on the upfront with the document review to middle shop drawing review.
**Jdawson**: They have a general plug in here for 40 hours of just general consulting and then at 20 visits.
**Jdawson**: But you know, they're almost half the price too, so it's kind of a wash.
**Jdawson**: So these guys have more site visits included but the other group had more tests included.
**Jdawson**: And of course those are optional.
**Jdawson**: But I have found in times past where you get out there and you start testing these things, the guys that are putting it in may not be paying as much attention as they should be.
**Jdawson**: And so getting some of these may, may not be a bad investment really.
**Speaker 1**: Well a lot of times too.
**Speaker 1**: We'll write it in the window sub like we're going to test it but every time it fails and you're paying for the next test and.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, yeah, that usually that's a good.
**Jdawson**: Cures way to put it in a problem.
**Jdawson**: That's good, that's good.
**Jdawson**: So that's.
**Jdawson**: I'll send both these over.
**Jdawson**: The scope is pretty close to the same but there were those few differences.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: All right, sounds good Justin.
**Jdawson**: I appreciate it.
**Speaker 1**: I want to throw this together.
**Speaker 1**: We'll get this out and see when we get started.
**Speaker 1**: This can be an awesome project.
**Speaker 1**: That is.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: You know.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Who are these guys?
**Speaker 1**: They're, they call them Ibex and they're into, I mean Their biggest thing, like, restaurant, you know, they're restaurateers, I guess.
**Speaker 1**: And then they've got into, you know, they have a solar panel company they own and, you know, they're now getting into all these developments.
**Speaker 1**: We're like, we're looking at this one in Kentucky that I was telling you about.
**Speaker 1**: Like, that's huge.
**Speaker 1**: They just came to Brandon yesterday with another billion dollar project in North Carolina and.
**Jdawson**: Whoa.
**Speaker 1**: I know we talked to you a little bit, but that thing in Cape Coral is probably going to go.
**Speaker 1**: So, you know.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, it's like between one and two billion dollars.
**Jdawson**: Oh, wow.
**Speaker 1**: That, you know, that's a lot.
**Speaker 1**: But there's going to be a lot of different pieces and parts.
**Speaker 1**: You know, there's, wow, over a thousand units.
**Speaker 1**: You know, it's a 300, almost 300 acre site.
**Speaker 1**: You'll have golf course.
**Speaker 1**: We're building it.
**Jdawson**: Where did he run into these guys?
**Speaker 1**: We're building the Westfield Collective in Indianapolis.
**Speaker 1**: That's where we met him.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, wow.
**Speaker 1**: We're doing.
**Speaker 1**: We're.
**Speaker 1**: He was building a similar site in Cincinnati.
**Speaker 1**: He's had so much trouble with that contractor.
**Speaker 1**: He's going crazy.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: And this job was another one where it was, you know, that they did a design, but the price was coming in millions over their budget.
**Speaker 1**: So we came in and they met us and Brandon worked his magic.
**Speaker 1**: We did some of our own designs, changed the building around to make it fit their budget, and now we're kicking ass.
**Speaker 1**: We started erecting steel this week and like, these guys got connections with finance people that.
**Jdawson**: That's where it's at.
**Speaker 1**: That's where they party.
**Speaker 1**: So they've approved us for that job in Cape Coral.
**Speaker 1**: So now it's just a matter of we just got to run some more numbers and that'll go.
**Jdawson**: Wow.
**Jdawson**: Wow.
**Jdawson**: Design team already in place there?
**Speaker 1**: Nope.
**Jdawson**: No, no.
**Jdawson**: All right, let me know.
**Speaker 1**: So, yeah, I'm.
**Speaker 1**: That's just.
**Speaker 1**: It's a lot.
**Speaker 1**: It's a lot to get going.
**Speaker 1**: And, you know, that's crazy.
**Jdawson**: But, you know, it's like the guys that have the finance, they're going, they're moving.
**Jdawson**: That's really the only thing that's a hindrance to, to anything because especially in Florida, the demand is there, the need is there, the want is there, the tourism, strong.
**Jdawson**: It's just people trying to find the money to make it work.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, we found it.
**Speaker 1**: So, yeah, so, like, that's what, you know, I got, you know, people talked to already lined up.
**Speaker 1**: I got a good friend that's pretty high up at Layton.
**Speaker 1**: So once that thing pops, I'm gonna bring.
**Speaker 1**: Start bringing over some.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Big talent, and that's awesome.
**Speaker 1**: We're gonna be like.
**Speaker 1**: I can't even imagine, like, companies are always happy to have couple hundred million in backlog.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, we'll have 3 billion in backlog for the next.
**Jdawson**: You just went from here to, like.
**Speaker 1**: Rocket ship man the sky?
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: It's crazy.
**Jdawson**: It's crazy.
**Jdawson**: Well, we.
**Jdawson**: We've got similar metrics in place.
**Jdawson**: Metrics.
**Jdawson**: Probably not the right word, but systems to get some.
**Jdawson**: You know, we've got people we're talking to, interviewing with, and other partners, if you will, that we can bring alongside to make sure we keep up with whatever's going on.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: That's awesome, man.
**Jdawson**: Be good.

**Speaker 1**: Yeah, it's.
**Jdawson**: It.
**Jdawson**: Did they ever reach out to you on the one in Clearwater, the condo tower renovation?
**Jdawson**: You may not even be busy or, you know, maybe too busy for it now, but they.
**Speaker 1**: If they tried calling me.
**Speaker 1**: I missed their call, I guess.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: I don't know where they're at fully yet.
**Jdawson**: I think they're still trying to get a few things together, but it'd be better if you.
**Speaker 1**: If you talk to them.
**Speaker 1**: Say, hey, I just like to set up a meeting, talk to these guys.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Brandon's gone until he doesn't get back.
**Speaker 1**: He's over in Europe somewhere until the 10th.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: So if you could set something up the week of the 14th, that'd be cool.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: I'll be back, too.
**Speaker 1**: I'll be gone that week of the seventh in Indiana.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
