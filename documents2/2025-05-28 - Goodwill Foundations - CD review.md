## Transcript
**Gducharme**: Just show you my window.
**Jdawson**: Awesome.
**Jdawson**: Are we expecting anyone else?
**Acannon**: I don't think Jer will be on.
**Jdawson**: Okay, and then is Andrew Cannon gonna join us?
**Gducharme**: He probably won't make it today.
**Jdawson**: Okay, well, we will just jump right in it, then.
**Jdawson**: I will fully admit the CDs are not in their best shape, but they're coming along.
**Jdawson**: We're probably about, like, 80% of the way there.
**Jdawson**: So I basically just marked up the scope document that you guys had sent over.
**Jdawson**: I just have some clarifying questions, and then just want to make sure that we're showing that sort of reworked restroom area on the lower level correctly.
**Jdawson**: So I will go ahead and share.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Very fun and exciting.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, I was just like.
**Gducharme**: It's quite the color palette.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: I love first color on the computer.
**Gducharme**: Andrew thinks that's the right colors, but of course it is.
**Jdawson**: Okay, let's get to a bigger view.
**Jdawson**: So I sort of.
**Jdawson**: Glenn and I sort of caught up on this area, but I still am like.
**Jdawson**: I don't know if I'm understanding what we need to do as far as new build out correctly.
**Jdawson**: So, again, just want to make sure.
**Gducharme**: We'Re.
**Jdawson**: Showing this all correctly.
**Jdawson**: So, as I understand, there's some, like, unmovable elements in here.
**Jdawson**: Flip the door around to this side, and then we can either make the storage room smaller like this, or we can, like, sort of recapture some of that space.
**Jdawson**: It was feeling like.
**Jdawson**: I don't know if that's really worth it to me personally, but you could tell me differently.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: Right where you have that purple line that's.
**Speaker 3**: I guess that would kind of be in front of the.
**Speaker 3**: That panel that's there.
**Speaker 3**: So we wouldn't have to move that panel if we just took the wall and.
**Speaker 3**: And jigged it out enough to fit that door.
**Speaker 3**: The ADA door in there.
**Speaker 3**: And then would it help if I pulled up this real quick?
**Speaker 3**: What we're like, the existing.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, sure.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I do think that panel is in a good location.
**Jdawson**: It's like, five feet from that corner, so it gives us plenty of room to pop in that door to the restroom.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: I thought I had a markup of this.
**Speaker 3**: I probably do somewhere, but either way, that.
**Speaker 3**: That plumbing stack coming into the ground somewhere over there pretty much right here.
**Speaker 3**: Then we have that column that's right there somewhere.
**Speaker 3**: So if we took this wall here and just kicked it out to give us enough room to put our door in, I could do a door.
**Speaker 3**: But if we put our door here.
**Speaker 3**: Okay, now we're in the middle of this existing door for the storage room.
**Speaker 3**: So we would want to take.
**Jdawson**: Shift everything over.
**Gducharme**: Oh, shoot.
**Gducharme**: What the heck did I do?
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, I just take this door and.
**Jdawson**: Okay, I'm following.
**Jdawson**: We will get that adjusted.
**Speaker 3**: Jesse, do you have another.
**Speaker 3**: Do you have another idea for this?
**Gducharme**: This, this.
**Speaker 3**: Without moving that plumbing and getting into the ground, this seems like the most efficient way to just get that door in there.
**Speaker 3**: So this is a really crude mark of image promise.
**Gducharme**: That column, Andrew.
**Gducharme**: And I don't know, we missed that or.
**Gducharme**: I didn't realize there was a column in there.
**Gducharme**: But is that.
**Gducharme**: Is that going to be okay to.
**Gducharme**: To make that storage room a little bit smaller?
**Acannon**: Maybe.
**Speaker 3**: The.
**Acannon**: I know they wanted to make that ada.
**Acannon**: And then they were okay with removing that shower.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Acannon**: If that would make a way for that to be ada.
**Speaker 3**: It doesn't help us with this.
**Speaker 3**: So the, the issue is here.
**Speaker 3**: So this is the entrance to the bathroom currently.
**Acannon**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: Go in here, go right, go left.
**Speaker 3**: Well, that old wall that we had was a.
**Speaker 3**: Was a hallway.
**Speaker 3**: You can see where we tore that out.
**Speaker 3**: And then when we tore that out, there was a.
**Speaker 3**: That was, you know, hiding this floor drain in this plumbing stack.
**Speaker 3**: When we tore that out, you can see this column now exposed here that we would.
**Speaker 3**: That we weren't able to see.
**Speaker 3**: So this, this wall comes over here.
**Speaker 3**: This storage room wall right here is where it meets.
**Speaker 3**: So we just.
**Speaker 3**: We need to shift this wall over enough to fit a door between this column.
**Gducharme**: But I think so, Glenn, what he's saying is we can get rid of that shower and move both doors over a little bit if we go back to Emily's plan.
**Gducharme**: And then the doors on the other side of the column, it just comes straight into the bathroom because we're redoing the floors and whatnot.
**Gducharme**: Emily, get your plan up.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that works for the other restroom.
**Jdawson**: Call it like our stuff in the wall is like approximately there.
**Jdawson**: I think we have to go to this side.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: If we're doing that, we're adding a hallway there.
**Speaker 3**: And that's just.
**Speaker 3**: This is a wasted space.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I think I would do something like this.
**Jdawson**: And then storage door dislikes.
**Gducharme**: But how much do we.
**Gducharme**: Can you go back to that photo, Glenn?
**Speaker 3**: Sure.
**Jdawson**: I might have a good one too.
**Speaker 3**: I took a handful of photos I can flip through and you can kind of see this a close up of it.
**Speaker 3**: This is looking into the bathroom.
**Speaker 3**: This is looking the other way.
**Speaker 3**: So this is the panel we want to try and just come ahead of.
**Speaker 3**: So we can come pretty far out here.
**Speaker 3**: I really only need.
**Speaker 3**: We probably Just right here.
**Speaker 3**: If we came out 2ft and then met 3ft at the wall.
**Gducharme**: I mean, does that vestibule, the current one that's there, make that bathroom Non Ada?
**Jdawson**: Oh, yeah, big time.
**Gducharme**: Like, if they have to go into that and then go in the bathroom.
**Speaker 3**: Emily, what if we just pulled this.
**Jdawson**: Wall forward.
**Speaker 3**: And then Ada door.
**Speaker 3**: We would still keep this same door opening, but we would just widen that because this wall's got to go anyways.
**Speaker 3**: That's part of the demo plan.
**Speaker 3**: Wasn't.
**Speaker 3**: So I didn't have him take it out, but this wall is going.
**Speaker 3**: Hold on.
**Speaker 3**: That copper stack is right there too.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, yeah.
**Speaker 3**: This wall, honestly should just stay.
**Speaker 3**: And it should just be boxed out with an access panel without having to.
**Speaker 3**: We have this stack that goes all the way up.
**Speaker 3**: They believe this one's a vent stack.
**Speaker 3**: That is our pipe jack.
**Speaker 3**: That goes all the way up to the ceiling or the roof.
**Speaker 3**: I mean.
**Acannon**: I think moving it over to fit that door on what you had just drawn, I think that would be fun.
**Jdawson**: Okay, Andrew, I can make that little, like, space plan change and just send you a quick PDF that you can send to whoever needs to see that too.
**Jdawson**: Perfect.
**Jdawson**: We'll get that fixed up.
**Jdawson**: Still on the lower level, I was looking at these notes about the exterior columns here.
**Jdawson**: Are you all going to want us to show anything on our drawings about this?
**Jdawson**: I'm just getting nervous that it'll start to feel like permitting is questioning us about, like, structural engineering, I guess I should say.
**Gducharme**: Oh, no, I would just put.
**Gducharme**: I would just put where we're going to wrap them with wood.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: I did keep.
**Jdawson**: There are some general notes on there, and I kept it, like, kind of vague.
**Jdawson**: Like add new is required because it looks like we're sort of like taking out two and then adding three.
**Jdawson**: So it's.
**Gducharme**: This is like a.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, it's like a.
**Gducharme**: I don't know.
**Gducharme**: It's not much of a structure.
**Gducharme**: Andrew, what do you think?
**Acannon**: Yeah, it's just a roof, basically.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: I'll keep the general notes on there.
**Jdawson**: I'm just not showing, like.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, exactly.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Speaker 3**: We just want to scoot.
**Speaker 3**: Scoot this over between the wall here and then put another one here.
**Speaker 3**: That way.
**Speaker 3**: This door.
**Jdawson**: This door is opened up uninhabited.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: Well, we're shipped in the first one, too.
**Gducharme**: So it's not right in front of the window.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: Both of these.
**Speaker 3**: We'll have one in the middle.
**Gducharme**: Right.
**Speaker 3**: So what, go to the edge of the window here, edge of the door here, and then one right in the middle of this.
**Speaker 3**: We'll add that one and we'll just.
**Speaker 3**: We'll just add a wood one in there and wrap it.
**Speaker 3**: Unless I can find one of these, it doesn't really matter.
**Speaker 3**: It's getting wrapped.
**Acannon**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: Do you all have a preference on what type of wood?
**Jdawson**: I see cedar on here.
**Gducharme**: That what Jared said, Andrew, when we were out there.
**Acannon**: Yeah, cedar.
**Acannon**: Or a marketing guy wants cedar or.
**Acannon**: But us facilities guys want zero maintenance wood.
**Acannon**: Like cedar.
**Acannon**: Like so composite or something.
**Acannon**: But cedar is totally fine.
**Speaker 3**: Thinking we put it on there and then you never have to maintain it.
**Acannon**: Yeah, they make it pretty.
**Speaker 3**: Pretty realistic looking these days, you know?
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Acannon**: Yeah, that's totally fine.
**Jdawson**: Okay, I think that's it for first floor to get up here.
**Jdawson**: We discussed that area.
**Speaker 3**: This.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Switching all the lights to can lights.
**Jdawson**: No problem.
**Jdawson**: And then I saw this note here about three different zones.
**Jdawson**: Do you all have any preference on what that looks like?
**Jdawson**: Maybe it's just like coming across here like a zone, a zone and a zone.
**Acannon**: Trying to remember how they wanted it.
**Jdawson**: There are.
**Acannon**: We have drawn that.
**Acannon**: I think that's good.
**Jdawson**: Okay, well, at least have it in the drawings and then if that needs to shift, we can just update.
**Acannon**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: We're gonna new do new crown molding all the way around.
**Jdawson**: Do I assume we want to paint that black to match the ceiling?
**Gducharme**: I would think it would be white because.
**Gducharme**: And it's in crown molding is probably a bad word because it's just a piece of one by four that we put.
**Gducharme**: Because the wall is so rough that it would just.
**Gducharme**: They can bend it to be at the bottom of the floor joists.
**Acannon**: And.
**Gducharme**: Then give like a nice straight white edge to the wall.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Acannon**: You can remove that one light fixture, that linear fixture over.
**Acannon**: I see what number it was.
**Jdawson**: This one here?
**Acannon**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And then new floor tile in the restrooms.
**Jdawson**: And then I just made a note that we'll need some new wall tile too.
**Speaker 3**: Floor tile.
**Speaker 3**: Or we.
**Speaker 3**: We're just doing polished concrete in the whole lower level.
**Jdawson**: This lower level says all polished concrete and then new tile in the bathrooms.
**Jdawson**: But I mean, if you guys want polished concrete in the bathroom, stew that.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, let us.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: Andrew, what do you want to do about that?
**Speaker 3**: Because all.
**Speaker 3**: All three bathrooms currently have tile.
**Speaker 3**: We are going to be demoing out the walls.
**Speaker 3**: So matching the tile down there would be.
**Gducharme**: We're not matching the tile, Glenn.
**Gducharme**: We're replacing all the tile.
**Gducharme**: That's already what we plan.
**Speaker 3**: Okay.
**Speaker 3**: We are putting all new tile in there on the floor either way.
**Gducharme**: In those two bathrooms.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: Okay.
**Speaker 3**: I thought.
**Speaker 3**: I thought we were doing the concrete on the hole.
**Speaker 3**: The whole floor?
**Speaker 3**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: The rest of this floor.
**Jdawson**: Concrete and confirming, like even in this room we want to polish concrete.
**Acannon**: Correct.
**Jdawson**: Okay, lovely.
**Jdawson**: Going up to the first floor again, just confirming on these restrooms.
**Jdawson**: Everything in these and the second floor restroom should stay as is.
**Jdawson**: Correct?
**Acannon**: Yes, correct.
**Speaker 3**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And then it looks like maybe we're trying to add a urinal.
**Jdawson**: No, no.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: This might have been an older file or something.
**Jdawson**: There are not urinals up there.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And then again, just a clarification there.
**Jdawson**: We're not showing any door swings on here, but I assume we would want new doors on these locations here.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jdawson**: And then we were just planning to match what's existing in the space, which is like they're just sort of hollow core painted doors.
**Acannon**: Yeah, I think that's fine.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: That was that question for this level, obviously.
**Jdawson**: We just said restrooms will stay as is.
**Jdawson**: Carpet everywhere.
**Jdawson**: And then I was just questioning if we want LVT in this sort of break alley and the washing machine area.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, the break room.
**Gducharme**: That existing vinyl floor, that's in there.
**Gducharme**: I thought we were leaving that.
**Speaker 3**: Yes, all that.
**Speaker 3**: Yes, all that's still in place.
**Speaker 3**: Both those.
**Speaker 3**: Everything.
**Speaker 3**: Everything.
**Speaker 3**: Everything above that line, this wall where the open area turns into the hallways here.
**Speaker 3**: Everything above that, all that has flooring.
**Speaker 3**: Top of the stairs.
**Speaker 3**: Exactly.
**Gducharme**: Yep.
**Acannon**: Washer and dryer.
**Gducharme**: That.
**Acannon**: That area has vct, is that right?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I believe so.
**Acannon**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And then I was questioning, are we trying to add a stove?
**Acannon**: No, it's just.
**Acannon**: We're just going to add a fridge in that, I believe.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And then the ice maker.
**Jdawson**: That's not a thing.
**Jdawson**: And then small item, but finishes to remain in this closet as well.
**Gducharme**: I think we're painting everything.
**Jdawson**: I'm mostly thinking about the flooring that we would want in there.
**Gducharme**: We weren't going to take out any additional flooring because we don't know what's under it.
**Speaker 3**: You want those shelves painted?
**Acannon**: Yeah, probably.
**Jdawson**: Everything else made sense.
**Jdawson**: I know we're not adding that.
**Jdawson**: And that was pretty much it.
**Jdawson**: Those are all the questions we have.
**Jdawson**: So, like I said, I'll get that little space plan update made and send back a PDF just so that can get going.
**Jdawson**: And then we'll keep wrapping up our CDs.
**Jdawson**: I expect that we will have a set ready to file on Monday and I know we're going to expedite.
**Jdawson**: So, Jesse, I'll just let you know when we're ready to do that and we can pay over the phone.
**Gducharme**: I thought you told me there was a.
**Gducharme**: With the city of Indianapolis.
**Gducharme**: They had a free three day.
**Jdawson**: You're right.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: Thank you.
**Jdawson**: So we will do that with the initial filing on Monday.
**Jdawson**: Do you guys have any sort of like, I guess, drop dead date assigned to when we need to have our permit in hand?
**Jdawson**: I don't know if the schedule is that fleshed out yet.
**Gducharme**: We got to be done by August, so like, that doesn't give us much time if we don't.
**Gducharme**: If you submit, we get it in three days and hopefully we got a permit on Wednesday or Thursday.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So maybe if we don't hear anything by then, I will just let you know and then we can expedite.
**Jdawson**: Like I said, they have.
**Jdawson**: Go ahead.
**Gducharme**: Have you submitted one in this for that particular program before?
**Jdawson**: Not in this jurisdiction.
**Jdawson**: Like not in broader poll, but in Indianapolis.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: I actually found a GSA job that was two floors of BMO Tower.
**Jdawson**: It was like 17,000 square feet or something like that.
**Jdawson**: And I got my release in like a few days, which is kind of crazy because there were like full MEPs on that project, so.
**Gducharme**: Perfect.
**Jdawson**: It's exciting for us when we need to move fast and save you guys some money too.
**Acannon**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: I will get paperwork to you quickly too, so we can get that going and be ready to file on Monday.
**Gducharme**: Good.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: Anything else you need from me?
**Speaker 3**: I just want to confirm we're pulling power from the meter out or the.
**Speaker 3**: The transformer.
**Speaker 3**: We're pulling power from outside somewhere and pulling it in.
**Speaker 3**: Right.
**Speaker 3**: We're putting in a new panel.
**Gducharme**: No, no, no, no.
**Gducharme**: We're.
**Gducharme**: We're simply taking.
**Gducharme**: Deem is going to take the meter center, pull out all the meters and just feed everything through the main meter on the building so that they got one meter.
**Gducharme**: Okay, Is this.
**Speaker 3**: Is it split up right now or something?
**Gducharme**: There's six meters on that building currently.
**Gducharme**: Oh, yep.
**Jdawson**: Nice.
**Gducharme**: Like each office has its own meter?
**Acannon**: Pretty much, yeah.
**Speaker 3**: Are we leaving them in place on the mountain?
**Gducharme**: They.
**Speaker 3**: They're mounted on the side of the building, I believe on the north side.
**Speaker 3**: Right here or the.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, There's.
**Gducharme**: There's a trough that runs along the wall, so probably just put a cap on that and wire them all together.
**Gducharme**: They got it figured out.
**Gducharme**: Demo.
**Gducharme**: They'll be taking care of all that.
**Speaker 3**: Are we just abandoning the meters in place and using one of them?
**Gducharme**: There's one big meter box there.
**Gducharme**: I.
**Gducharme**: Because I'm not an electrician, but I would think they would leave that, take out all the rest of them and just feed them however they do that.
**Gducharme**: They've got it figured out, though, so.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Gducharme**: Oh, there we go.
**Gducharme**: And there's a.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Gducharme**: Or maybe they'll pull those out.
**Gducharme**: Andrew, I think you know more about electric.
**Acannon**: Yeah, they'll just basically pull them out and either make junctions in there or rewire from those boxes to the meter.
**Jdawson**: All right, well, we'll keep going.
**Jdawson**: I'll get you stuff as soon as I can.
**Gducharme**: Excellent.
**Speaker 3**: All right, thanks, guys.
**Jdawson**: Thanks, everybody.
**Gducharme**: Thanks.
