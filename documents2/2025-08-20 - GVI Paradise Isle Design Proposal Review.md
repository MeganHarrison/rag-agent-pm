## Transcript
**Bclymer**: Hey, Albro.
**A.gonzalez**: Hey, Jesse.
**A.gonzalez**: How are you?
**Bclymer**: Good.
**Bclymer**: Sorry.
**Bclymer**: Just finishing up a little email here.
**A.gonzalez**: No worries.
**Bclymer**: I didn't think about it, but hopefully it was 4 o' clock Eastern Time.
**Bclymer**: I didn't know where you'd be.
**A.gonzalez**: I mean, I'm in South Lake in our office.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**A.gonzalez**: Living city.
**A.gonzalez**: So I'm.
**A.gonzalez**: This is 2pm Right here.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: I used to get to go out there.
**Bclymer**: We had a job north of South Salt Lake about 70 miles.
**A.gonzalez**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: A year ago.
**Bclymer**: Went up there two times.
**A.gonzalez**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: It's interesting.
**Bclymer**: Interesting.
**Bclymer**: I'd never been to that valley before that, so.
**Bclymer**: It's kind of cool.
**A.gonzalez**: It's.
**A.gonzalez**: It's beautiful.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**A.gonzalez**: It's not.
**A.gonzalez**: It's.
**A.gonzalez**: It's hot right now, though.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: That's what's crazy.
**Bclymer**: You think it's cool in Utah, but not.
**A.gonzalez**: No, no, no, no, no.
**A.gonzalez**: Actually, it's.
**A.gonzalez**: Let me tell you, 30 Celsius, but it's.
**A.gonzalez**: Let me tell you in.
**A.gonzalez**: What is that?
**A.gonzalez**: In 98?
**A.gonzalez**: It's 98.
**A.gonzalez**: So it's.
**A.gonzalez**: Man, it's not that.
**A.gonzalez**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Where you been?
**Bclymer**: Like, how was Spain?
**Bclymer**: You just.
**A.gonzalez**: Man, it was good and sad.
**A.gonzalez**: But.
**A.gonzalez**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: You know, people over there, you just go there to visit.
**A.gonzalez**: Well, we have an office there.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**A.gonzalez**: And this case, I went.
**A.gonzalez**: I'm not in charge of Europe, but.
**A.gonzalez**: But in this case, I took my daughter to college.
**A.gonzalez**: So she moves there.
**A.gonzalez**: So she moved there.
**A.gonzalez**: So that's why I'm saying that it was sad and good and sad.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Where'd she live before?
**A.gonzalez**: In San Antonio with me.
**A.gonzalez**: And then.
**A.gonzalez**: So now she's moving to Madrid, Spain.
**A.gonzalez**: And man, that's.
**A.gonzalez**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: You know, it's a long ways.
**Bclymer**: She just starting college.
**A.gonzalez**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: School.
**Bclymer**: My daughter's in her last year of school and then finally.
**A.gonzalez**: Okay, she goes.
**Bclymer**: She's at New Orleans, at Tulane.
**A.gonzalez**: So you know how these things.
**A.gonzalez**: Is not the first time.
**A.gonzalez**: This is the oldest.
**A.gonzalez**: And when she moves.
**A.gonzalez**: I don't know.
**Bclymer**: I only had one child, so I had to get over.
**A.gonzalez**: Okay.
**A.gonzalez**: So, you know, I have two, but, you know, at least the first.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**A.gonzalez**: Experience is not the same.
**A.gonzalez**: You know, I don't know the second one or third or whoever has six kids, you know.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Well, that's like my parents, they had.
**Bclymer**: There's seven of us.
**A.gonzalez**: Oh, my God.
**Bclymer**: You barely got any.
**Bclymer**: Like, they were just.
**Bclymer**: You didn't have to worry about too much time.
**Bclymer**: And it was just like they had more so they could watch the younger ones or something.
**Bclymer**: I don't know.
**A.gonzalez**: And.
**A.gonzalez**: And what about you?
**A.gonzalez**: You are like the.
**A.gonzalez**: The Middle.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Oldest boy, the fourth child.
**A.gonzalez**: Okay.
**A.gonzalez**: Four childs.
**Bclymer**: So you have a lot of three sisters.
**A.gonzalez**: Sisters then.
**Bclymer**: I had two younger brothers and a younger sister.
**A.gonzalez**: Oh, my God, that's fun.
**A.gonzalez**: So you're in the middle, right?
**Bclymer**: In the middle, Yep.
**A.gonzalez**: That's cool.
**A.gonzalez**: That's awesome.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Well, it's nice now.
**Bclymer**: As a kid, I was like, why'd you have so many kids?
**Bclymer**: And then.
**Bclymer**: Because, like, we didn't have any money or couldn't do anything and then.
**Bclymer**: But now it's nice because we're all, you know, our siblings are close and.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**A.gonzalez**: You have a huge family.
**A.gonzalez**: Yeah, I. I don't know.
**A.gonzalez**: I.
**A.gonzalez**: Well, at the end, the economy works with two kids, but I would love to have another two.
**A.gonzalez**: But not.
**A.gonzalez**: Not now.
**A.gonzalez**: But yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: I'm past kids, so luckily my daughter turned out great, so.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**A.gonzalez**: That's awesome.
**Bclymer**: Well, cool.
**Bclymer**: So I'm gonna share my screen here.
**A.gonzalez**: Brandon is joining or not.
**Bclymer**: He's actually driving, so he's not going to be able to join.
**A.gonzalez**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: I don't know if you're able to.
**A.gonzalez**: Huh.
**Bclymer**: So you know what we talked about, like, you know, the design up through sds, so.
**A.gonzalez**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Discovery.
**Bclymer**: You had conceptual and then schematic design.
**A.gonzalez**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: And then.
**Bclymer**: So, like, through all these.
**Bclymer**: That's what I need to understand just why.
**Bclymer**: And I'm looking at your budget and then especially, like, they had construction administration.
**Bclymer**: The 4 million.
**Bclymer**: And so I just.
**A.gonzalez**: No, no, it's not 4 million.
**A.gonzalez**: It's $4,000.
**A.gonzalez**: $4,000 monthly if we need it, like, not to exceed the monthly 4000.
**A.gonzalez**: Not to exceed $4000 hourly base.
**A.gonzalez**: Not to exceed that amount if needed because it's just for samples of things.
**A.gonzalez**: And.
**A.gonzalez**: And that's it.
**A.gonzalez**: And as you can see, you have like a.
**A.gonzalez**: A lot of faces and a lot of buildings.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**A.gonzalez**: But there's like a small buildings that.
**A.gonzalez**: There's just 65,000.
**A.gonzalez**: But there's then, then is the.
**A.gonzalez**: The phase six that is too huge towers that maybe we can.
**A.gonzalez**: We can save a lot of money, man.
**Bclymer**: Well, it's like you have a lot.
**Bclymer**: When I look at your responsibility matrix.
**A.gonzalez**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: You know, because, you know, in my mind, talking with Danny, like, once you are through this.
**A.gonzalez**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: These three phases, like, you're really not.
**Bclymer**: You don't have to do anything other than have a guy there, you know, attend the OAC meetings to basically make sure something's changed or something.
**A.gonzalez**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Looked at.
**Bclymer**: To keep the design concept going.
**A.gonzalez**: Yeah.
**A.gonzalez**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: So, but that's what I'm saying is, you know, this work being $6 million, that's a lot.
**A.gonzalez**: No, but also it's.
**A.gonzalez**: It's also.
**A.gonzalez**: Is the.
**A.gonzalez**: In.
**A.gonzalez**: In.
**A.gonzalez**: In dd.
**A.gonzalez**: As you can see, we do some stuff.
**A.gonzalez**: I don't need to do anything in DD if you don't want to.
**Bclymer**: Well, that's what, like Danny, like in his proposal, he's doing everything from here out.
**Bclymer**: It's almost like you're.
**Bclymer**: You're just, you know, like the 4,000amonth to be there, just kind of monitor what's going on.
**A.gonzalez**: Okay, so.
**A.gonzalez**: So I want.
**A.gonzalez**: I can.
**A.gonzalez**: I can move everything from the right side and reduce a lot, actually.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: All this stuff is done by him and his team, like finishing up the drawings I think we had here.
**Bclymer**: Like.
**A.gonzalez**: But if we don't need to be supporting, man, that will be a lot.
**A.gonzalez**: It's like.
**Bclymer**: Yes, we just.
**A.gonzalez**: We just need to be in.
**A.gonzalez**: In and review floor plans and give comments.
**A.gonzalez**: That's awesome.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: They would take over and like, do all of that.
**Bclymer**: Do all the coordination with the MEPs and.
**A.gonzalez**: Okay, yeah.
**A.gonzalez**: But then also, I think we can be more efficient and, you know, this is like, we can revise it and take that out for sure and you just leave hours for being the OEC meetings and that's it.
**A.gonzalez**: So it will be almost nothing.
**A.gonzalez**: But also, this could be a placeholder, but let's see how we can save.
**A.gonzalez**: Also, like, you don't need to do that much design, man.
**Bclymer**: As far as.
**Bclymer**: What do you mean?
**A.gonzalez**: Like, if you go to the faces, we can have the same buildings and just different facades, you know, but all depends on the market.
**A.gonzalez**: So it's.
**A.gonzalez**: This project will be in five years, six years, and maybe the next phases, we just moving things and maybe it moves the budget of construction to a better place and also the design budget, you know.
**Bclymer**: Well, we wanted to like, just really be done with this in the first year, like up to the schematic design work on everything.
**Bclymer**: I don't know if that's possible.
**A.gonzalez**: Oh, yeah, in my case, yes.
**A.gonzalez**: But if, but if, but, but can you go to the.
**A.gonzalez**: To the upper level?
**A.gonzalez**: The other one?
**A.gonzalez**: No.
**A.gonzalez**: Above.
**A.gonzalez**: No, go to.
**A.gonzalez**: Where is the program previous?
**A.gonzalez**: Like maybe the 62 or go up.
**A.gonzalez**: Go up this one?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, Here, here, here.
**A.gonzalez**: No, go down one.
**Bclymer**: This one?
**A.gonzalez**: No, that is all the faces.
**A.gonzalez**: Where it says all the faces.
**A.gonzalez**: Go to the sheet number 63, I think.
**Bclymer**: Oh, 63.
**Bclymer**: I got you this one.
**A.gonzalez**: No, let me see.
**A.gonzalez**: No.
**Bclymer**: Let me see.
**A.gonzalez**: Which one is it?
**A.gonzalez**: I'm.
**A.gonzalez**: Open the file.
**A.gonzalez**: Okay, go to the.
**A.gonzalez**: No, no, no, this is not the right one.
**Bclymer**: Let me see where is it and.
**A.gonzalez**: Where is it here?
**A.gonzalez**: Go to.
**A.gonzalez**: The page is a 68.
**A.gonzalez**: Sorry, the page level is 134, but in the PDF is 68.
**A.gonzalez**: This one.
**A.gonzalez**: You can see which phases are the most expensive one.
**A.gonzalez**: Even though I'm going to revise it and take like a lot.
**A.gonzalez**: The phase 4 and phase 4.9 and phase 6.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**A.gonzalez**: Between the 4, 4, 4 9.
**A.gonzalez**: It's in the core of the island and they are like totally different projects.
**A.gonzalez**: I understand that it's a different program, but I think business wise we can be more efficient and have not like exactly everything different.
**A.gonzalez**: No.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I think, you know, and really the only way to do it now is like because we're, you know, is, you know, once this thing is fully approved, then we'll go in and build what we actually want to build on the island.
**Bclymer**: Because we're not going to build a dry boat.
**Bclymer**: Storage.
**A.gonzalez**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Doesn't make any sense.
**Bclymer**: So things like that that we got to work out.
**Bclymer**: So really all we can do is price this the best way with.
**Bclymer**: And like if you have options, like you're saying, listen, if we don't change this building and just throw a facade on it, you know, because I can't.
**Bclymer**: I don't know if I sent you both of their.
**Bclymer**: You know, there was an older design they had done.
**A.gonzalez**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: And then they updated it.
**Bclymer**: You know, they have like all the floor plans done.
**Bclymer**: Like if we don't change the building at all, it's basically just draw what they had and put a new exterior on it and give it a new design.
**A.gonzalez**: Yeah, but it's also like an old design.
**A.gonzalez**: But also you can save in construction.
**A.gonzalez**: Remember that the.
**A.gonzalez**: This will be.
**A.gonzalez**: How many millions is your budget?
**A.gonzalez**: I don't know.
**Bclymer**: Let's try 600 million to build at 6.
**A.gonzalez**: 600.
**A.gonzalez**: If it's 600, 700, just moving, tweaking, some things you can reduce to instead of 600, 500.
**A.gonzalez**: And that's like revenue for example.
**A.gonzalez**: But we can just.
**A.gonzalez**: I can revise all these now that you said that I don't need to be involved.
**A.gonzalez**: Just be present and be sure that they are not moving a lot.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**A.gonzalez**: It will be a different number.
**A.gonzalez**: But even though just with the master plan, you see the first number.
**A.gonzalez**: That is 150.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**A.gonzalez**: After finishing the master plan and everything, we will review all the square footage and I think everything will improve in your favor.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**A.gonzalez**: You know, that's why it's that number of the master plan.
**A.gonzalez**: It's really sit down in A design shred and review how we can improve things.
**A.gonzalez**: Like let's take some roads that we don't need.
**A.gonzalez**: So it's reducing cost and cost and cost and cost.
**A.gonzalez**: The big budget.
**A.gonzalez**: No, like the 600 million, not this one.
**A.gonzalez**: Our fees and Danny's fees and engineer fees.
**A.gonzalez**: We are small budgets, but the big budgets.
**A.gonzalez**: So those big budgets, the strategy born when we finish the master plan and the design rate and then we have a new square footage and a new program obviously following this one, but improving and working in efficiency.
**A.gonzalez**: So that's what we bring the best value.
**A.gonzalez**: How to make you make more money.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Not billing.
**A.gonzalez**: So that's why we work with the same guys.
**A.gonzalez**: Exactly.
**A.gonzalez**: That's, that's what we.
**A.gonzalez**: Well, I don't know.
**A.gonzalez**: You know, Moises is the most difficult client.
**A.gonzalez**: But yeah, he likes to efficient to move things to make more money.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**A.gonzalez**: And that's everybody.
**A.gonzalez**: All the clients wants the same.
**Bclymer**: Yep, that's a good point.
**Bclymer**: And definitely something, you know, all we can do now because we just got to start with this until we get the final approval and then yeah, we're definitely going to change it to be efficient.
**A.gonzalez**: Yeah.
**A.gonzalez**: And then our budget, Danny's budget and all the engineer budget will change.
**A.gonzalez**: And then after we finish the concept design, knowing your budget of each building and going with you with revision, with you and your knowledge, we will adapt the concept design and again we can go out to the engineers and see if we can save more of the big budget.
**Bclymer**: And one thing that, and I don't know if it's just because I'm not sure why, but they like made every floor the same height.
**Bclymer**: There's no like penthouse tall units and, or bigger units.
**Bclymer**: And is that just, is that how they usually just start with something this broad and generic?
**A.gonzalez**: Well, business wise, you would like to sell penthouses.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**A.gonzalez**: Even though they are exactly the same.
**A.gonzalez**: Just raising a little bit the height.
**A.gonzalez**: And everybody's doing penthouses in the world.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**A.gonzalez**: Why?
**A.gonzalez**: Because people likes to pay more.
**A.gonzalez**: I don't know why.
**A.gonzalez**: To have something different.
**A.gonzalez**: That's the way the word works.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**A.gonzalez**: And knowing these.
**A.gonzalez**: Let me, let me review these, readjust it and send it back to you.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**A.gonzalez**: And let me change the responsibility matrix also.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**A.gonzalez**: We will do models.
**A.gonzalez**: So we will do everything in 3D even though Danny won't use it.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: We said you would do it in Rhino.
**A.gonzalez**: I think Rhino or Rhino or Sketchup or whatever.
**A.gonzalez**: Depending the size of the building.
**A.gonzalez**: If it's a big building, if it's a small building, we just do it in Sketchup.
**A.gonzalez**: That is faster.
**A.gonzalez**: We will give it to him and import it to Rhino and Revit and he can use it.
**A.gonzalez**: But it's not for construction.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: He'll take and convert those and that's what be his model.
**A.gonzalez**: Yes, exactly.
**A.gonzalez**: Our model is to do the small and do the fun part renderings for sale that you will use to get investors and to get whoever you need.
**Bclymer**: And we'll have to.
**Bclymer**: One thing we didn't address yet and I don't know how much that would be is to build a sales.
**Bclymer**: Basically a sales office, taste gallery or gallery.
**Bclymer**: We'll have to do something like that there to build out.
**A.gonzalez**: I can, I can.
**A.gonzalez**: I. I can add it to the budget without charging anything.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Just put.
**Bclymer**: I don't know with this varied of a. I guess things will be similar building to building or.
**Bclymer**: Well, when it comes to finish, is it going to be pretty much the same?
**A.gonzalez**: I think depending on the market that you can see the buildings in phase six.
**A.gonzalez**: They are higher end than the ones in phase one.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**A.gonzalez**: Of phase three.
**A.gonzalez**: So we will need to bring that extra value at least they need to feel that they are paying because they will pay more.
**Bclymer**: Mm.
**Bclymer**: And like if it's a rental, that's what those will start out as in phase one.
**Bclymer**: Like.
**A.gonzalez**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: We don't even really need to put them in it.
**Bclymer**: It would only be the condos.
**A.gonzalez**: M. Okay.
**A.gonzalez**: So you said that you were going to take out one of the buildings like the dry marina or which one?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And I don't know.
**Bclymer**: Let's see.
**A.gonzalez**: Because I have it here.
**A.gonzalez**: I have everything here.
**Bclymer**: There you go.
**Bclymer**: There's this Building 8.
**Bclymer**: Building 8.
**A.gonzalez**: I don't see it.
**Bclymer**: Able to see my screen.
**A.gonzalez**: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: This is like a 200 boat.
**A.gonzalez**: So that one is.
**A.gonzalez**: We.
**A.gonzalez**: I need to take that one.
**A.gonzalez**: 8.
**Bclymer**: Well, we got to replace it with something.
**Bclymer**: So that's why.
**Bclymer**: But I don't know what that's going to be.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, you had building.
**A.gonzalez**: It's going to be something else.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: You had this one and like there wasn't much in that.
**Bclymer**: No, that budget was 5, 8 and 2.
**Bclymer**: 8, 5 and 2.
**Bclymer**: Which is the.
**A.gonzalez**: Yeah, yeah.
**A.gonzalez**: It's like a.
**Bclymer**: It's a dockmaster's office.
**A.gonzalez**: Yeah.
**A.gonzalez**: It's a small.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**A.gonzalez**: Okay.
**A.gonzalez**: So maybe the building aid will be something else.
**A.gonzalez**: But we don't know what.
**A.gonzalez**: So we can.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I think they wanted to put like a community, like a mixed use building they were talking about doing where you could have like people could rent out like spaces if they Wanted to do yoga class or stuff like that.
**Bclymer**: That's what they were thinking.
**Bclymer**: Or community.
**Bclymer**: It was like a community event center, I guess you'd call it.
**A.gonzalez**: Yeah, but we need.
**A.gonzalez**: We don't need to find out today.
**Bclymer**: It's.
**A.gonzalez**: It's.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I mean, that's.
**Bclymer**: But it's like, you know, this thing.
**Bclymer**: The permits that are already approved for this, we could, if we got released, we go out there and start digging tomorrow.
**A.gonzalez**: What?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, they've got all the federal permits, the state permits for site work to start, rather.
**Bclymer**: I mean, we.
**Bclymer**: We still have to go get everything, you know, the building permits.
**Bclymer**: But as far as site work and lagoon and everything.
**A.gonzalez**: We need to run before you.
**A.gonzalez**: You dig something that is not in the right place.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**A.gonzalez**: Oh, my God.
**A.gonzalez**: Oh, my God.
**A.gonzalez**: No, no, no, no, no.
**A.gonzalez**: Let me.
**A.gonzalez**: Let me adjust it and send it.
**Bclymer**: I mean, it'll be September, early September before we get our hair back from them.
**Bclymer**: We're thinking so on this.
**Bclymer**: But yeah, it's definitely something.
**Bclymer**: We'll be doing something by the first of the year.
**A.gonzalez**: Okay, so you're thinking in terms of timing, because in your schedule is.
**A.gonzalez**: You are going to start construction at the beginning of the year.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**A.gonzalez**: So you need the.
**A.gonzalez**: The construction documents by the end of the year.
**Bclymer**: Well, just for these, like, what?
**Bclymer**: We're starting phase one and two.
**Bclymer**: This number one and two.
**A.gonzalez**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And then we already got a permit.
**Bclymer**: We can build this island and all these lagoons.
**Bclymer**: So, you know, then these.
**Bclymer**: I think we're starting in late 26.
**A.gonzalez**: Okay, well, we need to do the design shift.
**A.gonzalez**: The sooner the better.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, that's like, you know, if we get released, do we get approved?
**Bclymer**: You know, we would start the design here later this year.
**A.gonzalez**: Yes.
**A.gonzalez**: Okay.
**A.gonzalez**: Sounds like a plan.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: Sounds good.
**Bclymer**: Well, welcome back to boring old USA Utah.
**Bclymer**: You can't drink out there.
**Bclymer**: That's one thing.
**Bclymer**: I went and I took the clients out to dinner one night after, and we were in.
**Bclymer**: It was this, like, bar restaurant thing.
**Bclymer**: And so we're sitting there and we.
**Bclymer**: Waitress comes, we ordered an appetizer and some drinks.
**Bclymer**: I ordered a beer.
**Bclymer**: You can only order one drink at a time in Utah.
**Bclymer**: Yes, yes.
**Bclymer**: And the lady doesn't come to our table until the appetizer.
**Bclymer**: She brings out the appetizers.
**Bclymer**: I'm like, can I get my beer, please?
**Bclymer**: And she's like, oh, sorry, I forgot.
**Bclymer**: And so she.
**Bclymer**: It takes another 10 minutes for her to get there with the beers.
**Bclymer**: So she shows up at the table and she sets mine down first.
**Bclymer**: And I just.
**Bclymer**: I Chugged it before she could leave.
**Bclymer**: I said, here, would you get another beer, please?
**Bclymer**: Because you can't order another one until your drinks go on either.
**Bclymer**: You can't even order a drink.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, no.
**A.gonzalez**: And also, if you order like a tequila or a martini or whatever, it's just one ounce, so it's like baby drinks.
**Bclymer**: And then I.
**A.gonzalez**: If you ask.
**A.gonzalez**: Hey, can you give me the.
**A.gonzalez**: The next one double?
**A.gonzalez**: I can't.
**A.gonzalez**: Oh, my God.
**A.gonzalez**: So I can't drink like 20 of these.
**A.gonzalez**: But, like, I need to order and you need to walk all the time.
**A.gonzalez**: Yes.
**A.gonzalez**: Okay.
**A.gonzalez**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Well, they need those girls with the shot trays.

**A.gonzalez**: So you need to have like a.
**A.gonzalez**: Like a.
**A.gonzalez**: Like a handrail or something.
**A.gonzalez**: Guardrail dividing the part.
**A.gonzalez**: Where is the bar?
**A.gonzalez**: Bar, bar.
**A.gonzalez**: On the other one.
**A.gonzalez**: And it's.
**A.gonzalez**: It's interesting.

**Bclymer**: In Indiana, we just did a.
**Bclymer**: It's kind of like that because we did this.
**Bclymer**: It's called a Crate Escapes.
**Bclymer**: It's a dog bar, basically.
**Bclymer**: And yeah, you have to separate.
**Bclymer**: We had to put a railing in to separate the bar counter from the space because of there being, you know, minors can be in there because it's also a restaurant type place.
**Bclymer**: But guess.
**A.gonzalez**: Yeah, I don't know.
**Bclymer**: It's doesn't make sense to you or me.
