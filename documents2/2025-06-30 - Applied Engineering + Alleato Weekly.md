**Mlehman**: Other than we got some flooring grinding that will be happening later this afternoon.
**Mlehman**: I think they're going to start around 4:30.
**Mlehman**: Framing is pretty much done.
**Mlehman**: Started that this morning.
**Mlehman**: Wasn't much.
**Mlehman**: So at least the walls.
**Mlehman**: And then we'll get the ceilings.
**Mlehman**: Ceilings all framed in.
**Mlehman**: I got materials coming in through the window.
**Mlehman**: Tomorrow we're just going to keep plugging away.
**Mlehman**: Electricians are here getting temp lighting up and then we're going to start roughing in the walls.
**Lhoran**: It's pretty funny.
**Lhoran**: One of the guys asked me, did they break the windows when they were doing the.
**Mlehman**: No, no.
**Mlehman**: I had had it taken out last week so that we could get drywall up through it because.
**Mlehman**: Yeah, we're not standing sheets up in the elevator.
**Lhoran**: No, it was just when they did the ceramic tile removal, it was like a herd of elephants were running through there for like an hour.
**Mlehman**: And so.
**Lhoran**: Yeah, they thought that could have been when they broke the window.
**Mlehman**: No, no, no.
**Mlehman**: No broken window.
**Mlehman**: It's.
**Mlehman**: It's safe and sound.
**Mlehman**: The guys took it.
**Mlehman**: Took it back to their shop.
**Mlehman**: We'll reinstall it once we get our stuff back up here.
**Lhoran**: Yeah, that's what I let them know.
**Mlehman**: Yeah.
**Mlehman**: And then Friday evening, we were here till about 9:45, 10 o' clock, grinding the floors.
