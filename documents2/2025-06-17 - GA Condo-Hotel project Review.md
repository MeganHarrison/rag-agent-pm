## Transcript
**Jdawson**: Good, good, good, good.
**Jdawson**: Justin.
**Jdawson**: Sorry, I'm just a little bit late here.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, you're fine.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, no worries.
**Jdawson**: Getting every which way here.
**Speaker 1**: I hear you.
**Jdawson**: I don't know.
**Jdawson**: Shoot.
**Jdawson**: Brandon on here.
**Jdawson**: But anyways, talking to Brandon, he said one of the.
**Jdawson**: When we're looking at the.
**Jdawson**: The look of these are.
**Jdawson**: And are you familiar with the Hard Rock?
**Jdawson**: Their hotel, their reverb, or that's just like a series of their smaller.
**Jdawson**: Maybe.
**Jdawson**: Is it a smaller thing or.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, yeah, I can look that up.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: So the concept of the condo hotel is that these will be all individually owned, but they'll be able to be rented out.
**Jdawson**: No, I think they want.
**Jdawson**: They want to do, like, say maybe it's the upper floor because they want to put, like a rooftop restaurant bar and then put the pool on the roof as well to have.
**Jdawson**: I don't know if you got the site plan.
**Speaker 1**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: There.
**Jdawson**: What Brandon was thinking is.
**Jdawson**: And I could share it or.
**Jdawson**: If you want to share it.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, give me a second.
**Speaker 1**: Pull it up.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, this is super cool.
**Speaker 1**: Let's see.
**Speaker 1**: Here we go.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, actually love that.
**Speaker 1**: You go and find it.
**Speaker 1**: It was already up.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, let me share it.
**Speaker 1**: So here's the boutique condo hotel.
**Speaker 1**: You see that?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: See, the whole thing is possibly flipping the hotel.
**Speaker 1**: To.
**Speaker 1**: In the same place, but have the entrance on this side.
**Speaker 1**: Or like, move the whole thing over here.
**Jdawson**: Well, actually, like, turn it.
**Jdawson**: Like, rotate it.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, rotate it.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Like on the south side so that they.
**Jdawson**: The entries kind of on the top, and then the back side, you'd have like, the pool.
**Jdawson**: And then shift it a little closer maybe to the.
**Jdawson**: To the container area so that.
**Jdawson**: That you'd have this big balcony kind of on the roof that would overlook.
**Jdawson**: You know, and then maybe we line up the volleyball courts.
**Speaker 1**: So the pool.
**Speaker 1**: Those on the roof, you said?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jdawson**: So it would be up there.
**Speaker 1**: Just be up here maybe.
**Jdawson**: Whatever.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: However.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that would look.
**Jdawson**: But you'd have, you know, the rooftop bar and pool and patio and like, all of that so that people could be watching over, like, volleyball tournaments and stuff.
**Jdawson**: And even just we would maybe string those volleyball courts across the top of it so that, you know, it's kind of like instead of them just being bunched in a corner, they would be, you know.
**Speaker 1**: Maybe it's.
**Speaker 1**: Maybe it's oriented this way, right?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Just a little better view of them.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, Very cool.
**Speaker 1**: So this here, I can look up that brain.
**Speaker 1**: The reverb.
**Speaker 1**: So how.
**Speaker 1**: How many units?
**Speaker 1**: How big of units?
**Speaker 1**: Is there.
**Speaker 1**: Are there.
**Jdawson**: I don't, I don't have a room size on it, but I was just looking up online.
**Jdawson**: They said, you know, based on the footprint of this building, three stories should be plenty to get the hotel rooms.
**Jdawson**: But then if we do condos, you know, those are obviously going to be bigger.
**Jdawson**: But maybe there's, you know, that's the thing.
**Jdawson**: I don't know.
**Jdawson**: Space plan wise.
**Jdawson**: What?
**Speaker 1**: Okay, yeah, I mean we just need to get an idea what, what the direction, what the.
**Speaker 1**: What the program is to make it work with the perform of whatever you're targeting.
**Speaker 1**: And we'll have to do a little.
**Speaker 1**: Is this under a pd?
**Speaker 1**: I imagine this whole area.
**Speaker 1**: A PD meaning if we were to do like a zoning.
**Speaker 1**: Like zoning would be the first thing we look at and seeing like how tall can we actually go are there?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I don't think there's any height restrictions here, but something checking like the city is like can't wait for us to build this thing.
**Jdawson**: So they're on board this crew.
**Speaker 1**: So I would be interested to know.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, the height restrictions far like any zoning type stuff.
**Speaker 1**: I imagine something like this is going to be a PUD or a PD kind of thing that has its own rules basically.
**Speaker 1**: So whatever we have there.
**Speaker 1**: And parking, parking is another one far.
**Speaker 1**: And density, how many units they'll allow.
**Speaker 1**: So all of those are important.
**Speaker 1**: But I guess in an ideal world we'd want to know like number of, number of guest rooms, number of condos, what are these guest rooms.
**Speaker 1**: And if we're going toward the reverb brand, they may have their own standards, but then the condo, you know, and sometimes I've seen them completely separated, whether it's left and right or top and bottom where you have a separate core, you have different cores.
**Speaker 1**: So the, the condo folks are not using the same elevator as the hotel folks.
**Speaker 1**: I've also some.
**Speaker 1**: I don't know that we have the room for it, but seeing a separation of amenities too, depending on.
**Speaker 1**: I mean these aren't Florida condo owners, but Florida condo owners are super uppity.
**Speaker 1**: I hope you, I hope you're not a condo owner.
**Speaker 1**: But like they don't want to be hanging with the quote unquote riffraff.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Speaker 1**: Like they don't want to go to their pool that they own and have the family from Iowa coming down that they've got to deal with, you know.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So that is something that we've seen too.
**Speaker 1**: So number of condos and sizes we would want to see.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: The separation of access check in amenities like how much, how much we're going to separate and then what other kind of.
**Speaker 1**: If there are any inclusions here in terms of services.
**Speaker 1**: So like typical hotel would have at least a breakfast area, little spot.
**Speaker 1**: But I don't know if you're going to want also like a full restaurant in there or anything else that we need to be aware of.
**Jdawson**: I think with the restaurant, bar on the roof, that would maybe be it.
**Jdawson**: Now whether they, you know, have something with the hotel where they cook the breakfast, whatever they're doing a serve for breakfast for them.
**Jdawson**: Possibly.
**Jdawson**: Not sure how that would work.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: So just you said restaurant and bar.
**Speaker 1**: Is there actually going to be a cooking restaurant on the roof too?
**Jdawson**: That would be the plan, yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, so not just bar, it'd be a restaurant.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: And bar.
**Speaker 1**: How big is this restaurant?
**Jdawson**: That I don't know.
**Jdawson**: It's size of restaurant.
**Speaker 1**: So if we get an idea of size or seating capacity, kind of focused menu type within, like just generalities to know what we've got going on there.
**Speaker 1**: We'd bring on a kitchen consultant to help with equipment selection and layout and things like that.
**Jdawson**: When it comes to construction, it's gonna.
**Jdawson**: We're gonna end up using the structural engineer out of Pennsylvania.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And you know, he was asking, he's like, it's cheapest to construct a hotel out of wood framing, but if you have a pool on the roof, obviously.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that doesn't work.
**Jdawson**: So I don't know what is your thoughts on what the construction type should be?
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I think that's a big load to have for wood.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: I mean, and.
**Speaker 1**: And moisture and everything else.
**Speaker 1**: I think that's just probably a.
**Speaker 1**: Probably not the best idea.
**Speaker 1**: From there, maybe you go block and plank as a next step up maybe.
**Jdawson**: And then just have a cast in place structure for the pool area and.
**Speaker 1**: Then cast in place on top.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Speaker 1**: So if the.
**Speaker 1**: If they can carry that load of the pool on block.
**Speaker 1**: I don't know, maybe.
**Speaker 1**: Maybe just around that you've got some concrete columns.
**Speaker 1**: I don't know.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: What else have I seen?
**Speaker 1**: I've seen hotels with.
**Speaker 1**: I mean, you can obviously do ptu.
**Speaker 1**: That's going to be more expensive.
**Speaker 1**: You could do.
**Speaker 1**: Not sure what they did for the floor structure, but they did the ifc, the insulated foam concrete wall for the blocks on the wall and that's basically poured with insulation both sides.
**Speaker 1**: I seen that as an effective exterior, but I'm not.
**Speaker 1**: I'm trying to remember what they did for the floor system.
**Speaker 1**: I Don't know.
**Speaker 1**: I.
**Speaker 1**: I'd be curious too, what the, what the structural engineer would recommend.
**Speaker 1**: It's kind of the next step, most efficient scenario.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Just for noise.
**Jdawson**: That's why they use those planks, isn't it?
**Jdawson**: Aren't they good for noise?
**Jdawson**: And then you can.
**Speaker 1**: Well, yeah, they can be.
**Speaker 1**: You still typically put a, you'll put a topping on top.
**Speaker 1**: So usually It'll be a 10 inch.
**Speaker 1**: Usually maybe you can get it to 8, depending on the bearing distance.
**Speaker 1**: But an 8 inch plank with a 2 inch topping.
**Jdawson**: It, it.
**Speaker 1**: I think from the cost perspective that helps.
**Speaker 1**: The other thing we started looking at, what's that called?
**Speaker 1**: Epicor.
**Speaker 1**: Have you ever used Epicore?
**Speaker 1**: So it's an interesting system they came up with that is basically similar to what like a, like a plank job would be and that you need these bearing walls and tie ins.
**Speaker 1**: But the floor slab is actually a poured.
**Speaker 1**: It's a poured concrete slab, but the formwork is left in place and it's a metal decking basically.
**Speaker 1**: And so it doubles as formwork and reinforcing.
**Speaker 1**: And I think for a hotel you could probably leave it exposed and they kind of texture, paint it, skim coat it more or less at the bottom and they, they can get some pretty, pretty good efficiencies and they'll design that floor system in house, give you shop drawings and everything.
**Speaker 1**: So that might be something we could do where we, we do something either the.
**Speaker 1**: Either block or the insulated foam cores as you're bearing.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, as long as we can get this.
**Speaker 1**: Yes.
**Speaker 1**: So long as we get the strength of it.
**Speaker 1**: For the pool up there.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I would think you could just run a few columns up there, pour some beams on top to support the pool structure.
**Jdawson**: And because you'd want to make that its own tub to probably leak in anywhere.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So I need to get some information for you.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, yeah.
**Speaker 1**: I need a little bit more understanding of what the program is, the desired program.
**Speaker 1**: Hotels don't generally have trash shoots, but they do have linen shoots sometimes if they're doing in house laundry.
**Speaker 1**: So that would be a question too.
**Speaker 1**: The other thing then, condos normally have a trash chute.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So would we want to do a trash chute?
**Speaker 1**: And how does that, you know, work with everything?
**Speaker 1**: And then I think.
**Speaker 1**: What else?
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, Any other program elements?
**Speaker 1**: And then we would bring.
**Speaker 1**: You get the structural and.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And then mep.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, we'll bring an MEP fire.
**Speaker 1**: We would bring interiors.
**Speaker 1**: We would bring.
**Speaker 1**: We can bring a low voltage.
**Speaker 1**: And then the kitchen consultant for the.
**Jdawson**: So the restaurant, bar, these guys, they're restaurateurs, so.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, they will.
**Jdawson**: They have like Captivair, whatever company they got does all of their equipment, their kitchen equipment.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: So they would, they would lay it out and give us what they need.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, so I'll let you guys carry that and then may be good to get a waterproofing engineer consultant for the pool and so forth up on the deck.
**Speaker 1**: You guys are carrying civil and landscape.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: What about pool engineer?
**Speaker 1**: Would that be under the landscape?
**Jdawson**: I think maybe we could.
**Jdawson**: I don't know if we can design, build that with a pool sub.
**Speaker 1**: You may be able to.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah.
**Speaker 1**: What else would we need?
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I think that's a team.
**Speaker 1**: So we'll bring MEP interior, low voltage waterproofing, and you will.
**Speaker 1**: You guys have civil landscape, pool, kitchen and structural.
**Speaker 1**: And so I think for me the biggest thing is just.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Getting a better handle on what, what the scope of program is and any zoning information.
**Speaker 1**: Get on the, the PD or PUD or whatever this area is would be helpful.
**Speaker 1**: What is your, what is the, the timing and budget on this bad boy?
**Jdawson**: Well, the timing, I mean, I don't think we have a set date.
**Jdawson**: We have to be done and open yet.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so you'd have, if you want to just give me a design schedule.
**Jdawson**: What it would typically take for you once you get the go ahead and you got all the information you need to start, like, how long would it take to design and coordinate this?
**Jdawson**: Okay, so you give me that day and then I can look through that.
**Jdawson**: I gotta see.
**Jdawson**: You know, I would imagine it depends the budget on, you know, which type of hotel they're trying to build for.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And then the class of finishes for the condos.
**Jdawson**: I need to find that out.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, okay.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Is there.
**Speaker 1**: I mean, it'll probably.
**Speaker 1**: Once I get all this information, it'll probably take a week and a half or so to get all these figures put together.
**Speaker 1**: And then I'll, I'll call you up and walk it through and I'll share that with you.
**Speaker 1**: Is this something that you're looking at getting started pretty quickly or is there any.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we want to start.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Get started right away.
**Speaker 1**: All right.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, yeah, just let me know on these things here that we covered and then I'll put that together and get this out to our partners and get things.
**Jdawson**: And if you look up that reverb type.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And just share with us, like, I don't know, we just got to come up with some ideas.
**Jdawson**: I guess the Next thing is some one.
**Jdawson**: First things we'll do is get some elevations.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, so we'll do.
**Speaker 1**: Let me see, Reverb, Hard rock.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, so what we'll do is we'll do some layouts first.
**Speaker 1**: Make sure we're good on program.
**Speaker 1**: Make sure we're hitting.
**Speaker 1**: Hitting everything we need to.
**Speaker 1**: And then we'll go into that 3D development, elevations, renderings, things of that nature.
**Jdawson**: Okay, excellent.
**Speaker 1**: Yep.
**Speaker 1**: And I'll put that together in like our typical, like process.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Speaker 1**: Concept, schematic, ddcd and then ca.
**Speaker 1**: Do you want us to handle CA just hourly with you guys being design, build or.
**Speaker 1**: How do you want us to handle that?
**Jdawson**: Probably I would break that out, say like based on, you know, OACS once a month or we meet with these guys weekly on a lot of other jobs.
**Jdawson**: But this is a very short zoom meeting.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: No, that's fine.
**Speaker 1**: I guess.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, what I'll do is I'll give a CA for standard services and then I'll give a, like a price for site visits or something.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, we need to get up there.
**Jdawson**: Okay, cool.
**Speaker 1**: All right.
**Speaker 1**: Very good, sir.
**Speaker 1**: Well, I appreciate it, man.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: As far as the, the food courts, did you already price that portion of it?
**Speaker 1**: No, I have not.
**Speaker 1**: No.
**Speaker 1**: The only one I gave you one was for Seminole.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So this would be basically.
**Jdawson**: It's the same thing.
**Jdawson**: Volleyball.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, so you're looking for.
**Speaker 1**: For us to do that as well.
**Speaker 1**: So let me.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, so we've got, Let me see, Stage, like a similar program, huh?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, it just doesn't have like the city building or any of that, but other than that, it's pretty much similar.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, all right, cool.
**Speaker 1**: I'll add that to it.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Do you want those as two separate proposals?
**Jdawson**: I think so.
**Jdawson**: Because maybe.
**Jdawson**: I believe the ownership maybe will be different between the two.
**Speaker 1**: Yep, makes sense.
**Jdawson**: Imagine so.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, excellent.
**Speaker 1**: I'll get.
**Jdawson**: Make sure.
**Jdawson**: Brandon, you know, maybe we have a follow up.
**Jdawson**: When we follow up with the, you know, this information I need to get you.
**Jdawson**: We'll get Brad on here.
**Jdawson**: He talks to these guys a lot more than I do, so he'll have more details on all of that too.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: All right, sounds good.
**Jdawson**: Awesome, thanks.
**Speaker 1**: Thanks, Jesse.
**Speaker 1**: Appreciate it.
**Jdawson**: All right, we'll see you.
