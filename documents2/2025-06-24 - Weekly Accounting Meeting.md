## Transcript
**Accounting**: How is everyone?
**Bclymer**: Hello.
**Fnjie**: Hey, Brandon.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Accounting**: All right, so I saw that the calendar.
**Accounting**: Accounting calendar is done, correct?
**Jdawson**: Yes, yes.
**Fnjie**: It's missing also the insurance dates, though, until December 2025.
**Fnjie**: Pretty needs to ask those, but then I'm going to go ahead and add them to the calendar and Outlook.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Accounting**: So as this.
**Accounting**: Has this been sent out to the whole company?
**Fnjie**: Not yet, because I'm still adding them.
**Accounting**: Okay, well, the biggest thing is what.
**Accounting**: What we're talking about is like, you know, you know, hey, like, you know, credit card transactions are going to come in.
**Accounting**: Like you say, you know, here's the.
**Accounting**: Here's the accounting calendar and then a synopsis saying, like, you know, credit card transactions come in, whatever the 15th, you know, coded transactions are due a week later.
**Accounting**: Right.
**Accounting**: Subcontractor billing period is between the 20th and 25th of every month.
**Accounting**: Right.
**Accounting**: They should be done by the 25th.
**Accounting**: Owner billings are done between, you know, the 25th and the 30th, you know, should be done by the 30th.
**Accounting**: PSRs, you know, are due by the 5th of, you know, the coming months.
**Accounting**: So, for instance, you know, June PSRs are due July 5th.
**Accounting**: Make sense?
**Fnjie**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: And that way, you know, people can.
**Accounting**: Can see everything.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Accounting**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: Upload credit card transactions.
**Accounting**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: So, like, you know, you like Capital One download to, like, you know, that's the 23 third of every month.
**Accounting**: Is that what that is?
**Accounting**: Yeah.
**Fnjie**: So those, I'm not sure because you said that those are the due dates.
**Fnjie**: But then if you check on the next month, you won't see on the 18th.
**Fnjie**: But there's another chase, you know, so I think those are the due dates for the payment.
**Accounting**: All right, well, we need.
**Accounting**: The whole point of this is we're communicating dates to all the employees of when things are due, right?
**Accounting**: So on whatever day that we get our credit card bill, right.
**Accounting**: It gets imported, you know, that's the day, like, hey, credit card transactions, then everybody has a week to get them turned in.
**Accounting**: Okay?
**Accounting**: Like, that's.
**Accounting**: That's what I'm talking about when I say accounting calendar.
**Accounting**: Right?
**Accounting**: Boom, boom.
**Accounting**: You know, that's.
**Accounting**: That's an important thing.
**Accounting**: You know, payables, right.
**Accounting**: Like every month, you know, by the.
**Accounting**: By the 25th, like, all the sub invoices should be processed and, you know, sent to accounting for processing.
**Accounting**: You know, that should be.
**Accounting**: Again, that's an accounting date, right.
**Accounting**: The 25th of every month.
**Accounting**: All the sub billings should be in, you know, every, you know, every, whatever, two, every.
**Accounting**: Every other Thursday or whatever you want to make it.
**Accounting**: You know, PMs need to go in and clear their payables.
**Accounting**: Right.
**Accounting**: Whatever's in their court needs to be cleared every.
**Accounting**: Call it every week, every Thursday.
**Accounting**: Clear your accounts.
**Accounting**: Right?
**Fnjie**: Yeah.
**Fnjie**: So it's not, it's not like that.
**Fnjie**: So let me talk to Fatima because this is only for due dates, not like you were talking about it.
**Fnjie**: Like reflected per month or per.
**Fnjie**: You know, like you were talking about like per Thursday per.
**Fnjie**: So now.
**Fnjie**: So let me have a meeting with her.
**Fnjie**: Because this is only due dates.
**Fnjie**: So we need to add what you're.
**Fnjie**: The way you wanted to do it.
**Accounting**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: This again, this.
**Accounting**: The whole point of this is communicating the expectation to all the employees.
**Accounting**: Like they don't necessarily need to care about when our insurance shit is due.
**Accounting**: Like that's, that's an internal calendar for accounting that we're talking about due dates that people owe things to you guys.
**Fnjie**: Yeah, makes sense.
**Fnjie**: I'll talk to her.
**Fnjie**: So we can just have maybe, you know, we can set it up together so it makes sense.
**Fnjie**: Instead of due dates is just for the team to make sure that the reminders.
**Fnjie**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: For the owners billing as well.
**Bclymer**: We are yet to discuss with Jesse.
**Bclymer**: I think we need, we also need to discuss with Jesse to fix the due date or the timeline for that and also for the payable subcon invoice.
**Accounting**: What do you.
**Accounting**: What do you mean?
**Accounting**: What's the.
**Accounting**: What do you need to do about the owner building?
**Accounting**: What do you.
**Accounting**: What's your question?
**Bclymer**: To fix the date or are we, are we the one to decide on when are we going to have that due date for the owner's building?
**Accounting**: So owner billings should be due, should be submitted by the 30th of every month at the latest.
**Accounting**: So between the 20th and 25th we should be collecting and approving all the sub invoices.
**Accounting**: And then the 25th through the 30th, you should be preparing and submitting your owner billing.
**Accounting**: The 25th, all sub invoices should be processed and you know, exported to accounting.
**Accounting**: The 30th of every month, all owner billings should be submitted.
**Accounting**: The fifth of that following month PSRs are due.
**Bclymer**: Say for example, for me billing, for me owner's billing, it should be prepared on the 30th.
**Bclymer**: Is that correct?
**Accounting**: Well, so you don't.
**Bclymer**: The next class.
**Accounting**: So, so you don't remember, you don't prepare the owner billing.
**Accounting**: The.
**Accounting**: The PM will.
**Accounting**: Will fill out the owner billing.
**Accounting**: And then when they submit that, that is when you process it in account in acumatica, you Know, so all you're doing is, is, is when they process that, that's just that indicator to go and fill out the duplicate in acumatica.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I understand.
**Bclymer**: So for the May billing, so when is the due date for them to.
**Accounting**: Process that for the May billing, when is the due date for the client to pay us?
**Bclymer**: When is the due date for the PM to submit to us to accounting so that we can so for, for.
**Accounting**: For June, for this month.
**Accounting**: So, so in June, like tomorrow, all the sub billings should be processed.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Accounting**: Now by the 30th of this month the PM should have sent out the, the owner billing is due by the 30th.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Accounting**: So now some people may send it out, you know, you know, the 26th, 27th, whatever that is.
**Accounting**: But you know, by the 30th of every month at the latest, owner billing should be out.
**Bclymer**: Okay, okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Noted on that.
**Bclymer**: I also have question with regards to the insurance that you asked me to process.
**Bclymer**: Is the one you asked to Lisa the same with what I have processed, which is the bond.
**Accounting**: Say the question again.
**Bclymer**: You sent an email to Lisa asking what is that invoice for?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: Is that the Risk Strategies company?
**Accounting**: It's like 106 bucks or something.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: 1260.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Accounting**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: Didn't you already process that?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I sent you and the teams and I also save it in the checkbox for, for print.
**Accounting**: Yep.
**Accounting**: Yeah, no, I will, I'll print it here.
**Accounting**: Send it out.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Accounting**: Yeah, I don't want to.
**Accounting**: Again, I would rather pay insurance early than late.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Accounting**: But yeah, we, we need to get that stuff out.
**Accounting**: Like I, I don't know.
**Accounting**: I just, I want to get.
**Accounting**: Yeah, get, get that calendar out here, you know, this week so everybody knows what's expected, you know, and then, and then Maria, we can make a policy out of it, you know, so we put it in our policies and procedures, you know, because it's going to be the same thing.
**Accounting**: Right.
**Bclymer**: M.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Accounting**: Any other questions about that.
**Jdawson**: Brandon?
**Jdawson**: APBL's testing that we were working on with Ashley that the test is completed and then we could importing the pending invoice from Notion to Acumatica with no issues at the end of the day and then so the test is completed and then there are no issues at this moment and.
**Accounting**: Perfect.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: Okay, where are we at on AP bills and Notion?
**Accounting**: I mean is it caught up or.
**Jdawson**: Well, we need to update in light Akumatica live because we needed to update some mapping in test so we need to make the same updates in a Cumatica live.
**Jdawson**: And then we will be okay to make the upload from Notion to a Comedica live.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: What I'm saying is, like, when I go in here to accounting, I see pending invoices, United Rentals, Diamond Glass, Kimmich.
**Accounting**: So these are all things that need to be coding.
**Accounting**: Okay?
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: I already messaged AJ as well for that and Nick.
**Accounting**: Okay, so if.
**Accounting**: If you guys have things that PMs are not, you know, like, hey, like, stuff's not getting coded, instead of messaging them on teams, what I want you to do is email them and CC myself and Jesse on it.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And also, Brandon, I have question with regards to the AP aging that I sent last Friday.
**Bclymer**: So my question is, are we going.
**Bclymer**: Are we not going to process the bills that are due if the owner's billing is not received or the payment of donors billing is not received yet?
**Accounting**: Correct, correct.
**Accounting**: So if.
**Accounting**: If so, our.
**Accounting**: Our payment stipulations for subcontracts are what's called pay when paid, so.
**Accounting**: Meaning that we will release payment upon us receiving payment.
**Accounting**: Now, there's certain projects, right?
**Accounting**: Like.
**Accounting**: And like, if we want to release payment, then I will prove that.
**Accounting**: So, for instance, like, we should have released payments for Westfield Collective even though we have not been paid on that job because I talked to the owner.
**Accounting**: It's fine, you know, I'll make that approval.
**Accounting**: But you know, in general, right, whenever we go to process checks, so, like this month, right, you know, when you go to process checks, like, should not be processing anything where we have not been paid.
**Accounting**: So, like, I know that Uniqlo paid us so we can process those.
**Accounting**: Goodwill has paid us, I think, you know, I can't remember them all, but like, you know, if they.
**Accounting**: If they paid us, you know, release it.
**Accounting**: If they haven't paid us, then you need to get approval before you cut anything.
**Accounting**: Okay, so like, for instance, for.
**Accounting**: For.
**Accounting**: For May, which is now due Westfield Collective, all of our sub bills, you know, we have not been paid yet for that.
**Accounting**: So what I.
**Accounting**: What I want is, you know, after we, you know, processed all the payments for the stuff we have been paid on, you can say, hey, Brandon, you know, here's Westfield Collective, you know, we have a million dollars in sub bills.
**Accounting**: You know, do you want me to process that?
**Accounting**: You know, and I could say yes or no.
**Accounting**: You know, same thing with whatever other jobs.
**Accounting**: Like, pay everything that we've been paid on so that we know our books are balanced.
**Accounting**: And then from there I can make the business decision of what we Will pay and what we won't pay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Understand.
**Accounting**: And the, the biggest thing is, as we're getting, you know, we need to be collecting lien waivers.
**Accounting**: And so we need to come up, you know, with a.
**Accounting**: Like, I don't know if you guys have a written policy for this, but if not, please make one so that it's a nice reminder.
**Accounting**: So every single sub bill that we get, okay, when they submit for a bill to say, like, so, like, for instance, this month for June, let's say somebody's submitting $100,000 bill, it's their first payout, A subcontractor is going to submit the bill.
**Accounting**: With that bill, they should also have a conditional lien waiver.
**Accounting**: Okay, that says we will waive our lien rights on condition of payment.
**Accounting**: Then the next month.
**Accounting**: So now it would be July, okay.
**Accounting**: That same company bills us for another $200,000.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Accounting**: Their pay app would have a conditional lien waiver for the 200,000 and then an unconditional lien waiver for the hundred thousand that was paid.
**Accounting**: Make sense?
**Bclymer**: So to waiver.
**Accounting**: So the.
**Accounting**: Correct.
**Accounting**: So there's two types of waivers.
**Accounting**: There's a conditional, which means, hey, this is I'm going to waive my lien rights on condition that you pay me this amount.
**Accounting**: And then an unconditional lien waiver saying, hey, you, you have paid me.
**Accounting**: Here is my wave of lien rights for this amount.
**Accounting**: And so their first pay app, they wouldn't have an unconditional because they haven't been paid yet.
**Accounting**: They would just have a conditional payout.
**Accounting**: Number two should have an unconditional for pay up one and a conditional for pay up two.
**Accounting**: Pay at three would have an unconditional for pay up two and a conditional for pay up three.
**Accounting**: Do you understand?
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Accounting**: And this is the kind of thing where, like, you can, you know, use your resources.
**Accounting**: You chatgpt, use, you know, the Internet, Google to learn, you know, how does that commercial billing work?
**Accounting**: You can also ask Fatima.
**Accounting**: You know, she can teach you this kind of stuff.
**Accounting**: But if we don't have a, you know, if you guys don't have a policy or reminder, something built, please, let's put one together so that, you know, you guys can use it.
**Accounting**: And we can be like, all right, hey, every bill, does it have this check, you know, like you.
**Accounting**: We know that we have to have these things.
**Bclymer**: For the pay when paid policy.
**Bclymer**: Is that applicable as well for the direct billing?
**Accounting**: So it doesn't for.
**Accounting**: For direct.
**Accounting**: This.
**Accounting**: Great question.
**Accounting**: Thank you for Asking it.
**Accounting**: So for direct payment, those vendors, like, you see, like the toilet vendors and stuff like that, we don't have a contract with them.
**Accounting**: So our terms are typically net 30.
**Accounting**: So we.
**Accounting**: We don't.
**Accounting**: We don't have pay when paid.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Accounting**: So we just have to process.
**Accounting**: Process those normally, which, again, all of those should be very small amounts in retrospect.
**Bclymer**: But there are, I believe, a not so large amount, but mostly for the design.
**Bclymer**: Payment for design.
**Accounting**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: And.
**Accounting**: And that's just, you know, designers, you know, we don't.
**Accounting**: We don't get that.
**Accounting**: Right.
**Accounting**: They don't.
**Accounting**: They don't sign our subcontract.
**Accounting**: It's not the same, you know, but they're.
**Accounting**: They'll be the biggest one, you know, for that.
**Accounting**: But even though, like, you know, we bill that accordingly, they bill us in the rears, so it's.
**Accounting**: It's fine.
**Accounting**: But, like, looking at this, like, the United Rentals, you know, all that stuff, like, you know, it's $200, $300 here, like, on a.
**Accounting**: On a $10 million project.
**Accounting**: It's very small.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Understand?
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: I think that's.
**Accounting**: That's all you got, Jose, any questions?
**Jdawson**: Not on my end, Brandon.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: Thank you.
**Accounting**: Okay.
**Accounting**: Maria, is there anything we're forgetting?
**Fnjie**: No, we're good.
**Fnjie**: I'm just already talking with Fatima so we can have everything set up for the calendar and make sure those are working for the team.
**Accounting**: Awesome.
**Accounting**: All right.
**Jdawson**: Sorry, Maria.
**Jdawson**: And please include.
**Jdawson**: Include me to.
**Jdawson**: On that meeting because.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: To see the due dates related to my task.
**Jdawson**: Like, credit card.
**Accounting**: Yeah, yeah.
**Accounting**: All.
**Accounting**: All of this communication, Maria.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Accounting**: You know, with the team, all that should include Fritzi and Jose so that, you know, it's all one team.
**Accounting**: Everybody's understood, like, what's responsible.
**Accounting**: Because at the end of the day, right, like, you know, as, you know, you know, Fatima and her team, as we grow, they're going to be phased out, right?
**Accounting**: And we're going to be growing more internally, you know, and so you guys have to help each other as we grow, hold each other accountable.
**Accounting**: And, hey, don't forget this.
**Accounting**: You know, you're working on this.
**Accounting**: Like, and that way, everybody's working together so that nobody's forget something.
**Accounting**: Because at the end of the day, right, like, if.
**Accounting**: If Jose messes something up or he forgets to.
**Accounting**: To pay something, I'm coming down on everybody, you know, because it's just as much Fatima as it is Jose.
**Accounting**: Because you guys are one team, right?
**Accounting**: Like, and you guys got to help each other.
**Fnjie**: Yes.
**Fnjie**: Once the team are confirmed timing.
**Fnjie**: Guys, I'll check with you, okay?
**Fnjie**: So we can set up a meeting and make sure everybody's on the same page.
**Jdawson**: Great.
**Accounting**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: Thank you.
**Accounting**: Okay, thanks, guys.
**Bclymer**: Thank you.
**Accounting**: Sa.
