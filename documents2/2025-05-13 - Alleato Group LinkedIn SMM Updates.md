## Transcript
**Victoria**: Hello.
**Victoria**: Hi, guys.
**Victoria**: Hi, guys.
**Ataylor**: Hi.
**Bclymer**: Hey, what's up?
**Ataylor**: Hi.
**Ataylor**: Happy Tuesday, Brandon.
**Ataylor**: How's your leg feeling?
**Bclymer**: Good.
**Bclymer**: It's a lot better.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, My doctors got me on a ton of drugs, so it's healed, you know, it's been healed a lot faster.
**Bclymer**: So I can.
**Bclymer**: I can walk and sit down and drive and stuff.
**Bclymer**: So I'm gonna do a, you know, light workout this afternoon.
**Bclymer**: Stretching, things like that.
**Ataylor**: That's great.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, it's tough to not be able to do the stuff you normally do, so.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Ataylor**: I'm glad you're feeling better.
**Ataylor**: Let me share my screen.
**Ataylor**: Okay, so this is the agenda.
**Ataylor**: I don't think I sent it out today beforehand, but we can look at it together.
**Ataylor**: It's all good.
**Ataylor**: And so we're going to look at the rest of May content that we have a couple more things that need approved.
**Ataylor**: And before we do that, some things to note is the Aspire Health photos I have are all older, they're all from January, and they're like before pictures.
**Ataylor**: So if there are any updated ones, Maria, if you could ask.
**Victoria**: There's not.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Victoria**: That's what I was.
**Victoria**: That's what I was sending to you.
**Victoria**: That in case you see anything, because I already saw the folder and the pictures are okay, but not like the greatest.
**Victoria**: That's what I wanted the guys to go back and take pictures.
**Victoria**: If you see something, let me know.
**Victoria**: I have probably like three.
**Victoria**: That is like inside the.
**Victoria**: How do you call that in English?
**Victoria**: I forgot.
**Victoria**: Like with the holes, you know, like with the holes with everything.
**Victoria**: And there's like, you see the medical people equipment.
**Victoria**: So we can.
**Victoria**: Those are probably the best ones.
**Victoria**: But if we have more, maybe that's why I was asking the guys and they're going to take a long time.
**Victoria**: If you want to see that.
**Bclymer**: Well, you can.
**Bclymer**: You can.
**Bclymer**: You can always do like a progress.
**Bclymer**: You can always do like a progress thing where it's like you have a few of the.
**Bclymer**: Of the concurrent one, you know, the ones through the progress and be like, oh, you know, our team, you know, finished.
**Bclymer**: Finish this project for Aspire Health.
**Bclymer**: Like, you know, it's.
**Bclymer**: It's.
**Bclymer**: It doesn't.
**Bclymer**: Not every single one has to be perfect.
**Bclymer**: Like, it is what it is.
**Bclymer**: We don't have final photos.
**Bclymer**: You have final photos.
**Bclymer**: But I want to put it out there.
**Bclymer**: Like, oh, they're doing work for Aspire Health.
**Bclymer**: Like, that's the key.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, absolutely.
**Ataylor**: So.
**Ataylor**: And that we can absolutely do that.
**Victoria**: Can you click on the little.
**Victoria**: Do you see next to details, the little three Lines above.
**Victoria**: Above.
**Victoria**: All the way above.
**Victoria**: Next to Details.
**Victoria**: Click next to it.
**Ataylor**: Click on it.
**Victoria**: And then you see tiles.
**Victoria**: Click on tiles, please.
**Victoria**: Awesome.
**Victoria**: So we can see those.
**Victoria**: So if you scroll down, it tells you which ones I like.
**Ataylor**: Okay, but are these all before photos?
**Victoria**: Yeah, I think so.
**Ataylor**: Okay, gotcha.
**Victoria**: Right?
**Ataylor**: Right, Brendan, they look like before photos.
**Bclymer**: I have no idea.
**Ataylor**: From January.
**Victoria**: Yeah, probably I can.
**Victoria**: Yeah, because that's the thing they say they won't go back.
**Victoria**: Yeah.
**Victoria**: But we can do like a project.
**Ataylor**: Let me.
**Victoria**: You know what?
**Victoria**: Let me just right now ask Candid or Nick about it.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, yeah.
**Ataylor**: This will be great to put together before and after, but we need the after or else.
**Ataylor**: Because, I mean, if we just had the after, that'd be fine too.
**Ataylor**: But before, you can't see any Alito work, so.
**Victoria**: So, yes, so I'll ask them and then I'll let you know.
**Victoria**: Okay.
**Victoria**: So I'll read text.
**Ataylor**: That's great.
**Ataylor**: Thank you.
**Ataylor**: Thank you.
**Ataylor**: Okay, so that's something to just keep in mind.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: We're going to get into May content and I also wanted to ask for June, like, what projects we especially want to focus on.
**Ataylor**: I know, Maria, you mentioned a goal of folks or putting on two.
**Ataylor**: Putting on.
**Ataylor**: Posting two projects a week, either in pictures or.
**Victoria**: So I'm doing it on.
**Victoria**: On LinkedIn, Facebook and Instagram.
**Victoria**: So every time they send me everything, I already fill it out.
**Victoria**: I'll create a video template.
**Victoria**: And then I asked Jesse to approve it because some of them, Jesse and Brandon are like, no, the guys are not wearing the gear or this is inaccurate or they shouldn't be wearing this.
**Victoria**: So once they approve it, I'll just go ahead and post it on LinkedIn, Instagram and Facebook.
**Victoria**: What I'm doing, though, is just checking your calendar before posting.
**Victoria**: So I'm not going to have problems, you know, like maybe losing engagement from one of the posts or the other.
**Victoria**: But usually I know on Mondays you don't post.
**Victoria**: So usually Mondays are the ones that I post in Fridays.
**Victoria**: So we have, you know, like these type of things.
**Victoria**: So that's.
**Victoria**: So that's one thing.
**Victoria**: So I'll.
**Victoria**: I'll keep the videos running and then once approved, I'll post, I'll publish them.
**Victoria**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Okay, great.
**Ataylor**: So are there particular projects in June that we want to call out and maybe get some new videos or photos for?
**Bclymer**: So definitely, I would say the Westfield Collective would be one.
**Bclymer**: You know, we should be doing foundations and, you know, towards the, I think mid to end of June, we'll be setting steel okay.
**Victoria**: Yesterday I send you.
**Victoria**: Sorry, go ahead, brother.
**Bclymer**: And then Bloomington should be up and running because we just started that yesterday for Goodwill, so that one should be full force.
**Ataylor**: Okay, that sounds great.
**Ataylor**: And so.
**Ataylor**: Okay, I'll follow up on that.
**Victoria**: Yesterday I sent you.
**Victoria**: I sent you a drone footage that Chad sent to me related to Westfields if you want to add it there as well.
**Victoria**: And also the why we build videos.
**Victoria**: We already have like six people sending me the videos and they keep.
**Victoria**: They keep sending me more because I keep asking them.
**Victoria**: So I'll keep adding them to that folder.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Okay, perfect.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, that'll be for this month.
**Ataylor**: I'll use the Westfield Collective video you sent yesterday to finish the last two drone videos, because both of those, the script talks about Westfield Collective.
**Ataylor**: So that'll be perfect to show the one and then this new one.
**Ataylor**: Okay, let's go to the new content here today.
**Ataylor**: Okay, so this is one of the ones we haven't had approved yet.
**Ataylor**: So I'm just moving out a little bit.
**Ataylor**: This is a quote from the Goodwill Bart Excel center, but we need it approved by them, so.
**Ataylor**: I know, Maria, you're working on that.
**Ataylor**: Do you know where we are with it?
**Victoria**: Yes.
**Victoria**: So Andrew hasn't replied to me.
**Victoria**: So Brandon, can you ask Brandon Mulder about it?
**Victoria**: Because I keep asking Andrew Mulder.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Victoria**: Yes, please.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: And then if need be, I will move this one out and move some things around.
**Victoria**: Yes, moving in the meantime so we can have the approved.
**Victoria**: But everything is filled out.
**Victoria**: I think it'll be.
**Victoria**: It will be a yes, but still, once Brandon Nash him, I'm sure we will have a response.
**Ataylor**: Okay, great.
**Ataylor**: And then this is the drone video ready you looked at.
**Ataylor**: So that one is scheduled and good to go.
**Ataylor**: This is the.
**Ataylor**: I gotta make it real big.
**Ataylor**: Is the infographic I wanted to look at this month for more time, more money.
**Ataylor**: And it's very simple, like design, build versus quote the old way.
**Ataylor**: And then a couple of points so you can see up top.
**Ataylor**: First there's a couple of photos Alito group.
**Ataylor**: And then I'll give you a chance to look at this part down here.
**Victoria**: I think it's good.
**Victoria**: I think the only thing missing is the website.
**Victoria**: You can put it maybe.
**Ataylor**: Sure, yeah.
**Ataylor**: I can add it right where this, you know, like before, above or below.
**Victoria**: So were you able to read it or not?
**Victoria**: Random, because you're driving.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I can read it.
**Bclymer**: So a little knowledge for you guys.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: When you hear somebody say cheaper, what does that say to you?
**Ataylor**: I see what you're getting at cheaper, as in quality.
**Ataylor**: Low quality.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, exactly.
**Bclymer**: Now, you know, faster, maybe, like cost effective.
**Bclymer**: Sure, yeah, that's a much better word.
**Bclymer**: And then so on the old way, stuff like you said, designs after budget overruns.
**Bclymer**: And then you also say surprise costs after design seems like it's, you know, contradictory.
**Bclymer**: So I'll look at this.
**Bclymer**: I'll look at this a little bit more because it definitely needs some massaging.
**Ataylor**: Gotcha.
**Ataylor**: Okay, yeah, I'll send it directly to you so you can have it so you don't have to come into the document.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Ataylor**: I see what you mean.
**Ataylor**: Okay, perfect.
**Ataylor**: I'll make the change for the cheaper bit too, so that you are only looking at the things you need to.
**Ataylor**: And then this is the caption right now.
**Ataylor**: Times money and most projects waste both before the first hammer swings.
**Ataylor**: With the leader group's design build approach, you cut through red tape.
**Bclymer**: Anika, I need you to read slower and enunciate, please.
**Ataylor**: Okay, gotcha.
**Ataylor**: So time is money and most projects waste both before the first hammer swings.
**Ataylor**: With Alito Group's design build approach, you cut through red tape, control costs early, and deliver faster.
**Ataylor**: One team, one plan, one path to results.
**Ataylor**: And then let's talk the phone number and some hashtags.
**Jdawson**: Hey, Brandon, have you.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, this is something we can talk.
**Bclymer**: About.
**Jdawson**: Later, but have you thought about getting a Alito office phone?
**Jdawson**: Something that can forward and you can check messages or something?
**Jdawson**: Because one, plastering your cell phone everywhere.
**Jdawson**: Two, sometimes you're busy.
**Jdawson**: Three, sometimes you're busy.
**Jdawson**: I just know this because I had a subcontractor try to call our office, and you answered and didn't have the time of the day for him, and you're like, why are you calling me?
**Jdawson**: I was like, well, you're off.
**Jdawson**: It's because your phone is our office phone.
**Jdawson**: So just something to keep in mind as we have been putting this everywhere.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: So how does the caption look?
**Ataylor**: Assuming that we may or may not keep this phone number?
**Bclymer**: It looks okay.
**Bclymer**: Like I said, I'll.
**Bclymer**: I'll review the entire thing, but it sounded okay.
**Ataylor**: Okay, gotcha.
**Ataylor**: I'll send it with the graphic smaller.
**Ataylor**: Okay, so for the drone reels, since I just got the Westfield Collective video in yesterday and I'm working on getting those final scripts recorded.
**Ataylor**: Those will be this week to you.
**Ataylor**: That one's already recorded.
**Ataylor**: Okay, so the we build videos I'm also putting together this week as they come in.
**Ataylor**: And then the last thing to look at is this, Brandon, quote, be urgent early and make it a little Bigger.
**Ataylor**: So you can see it.
**Bclymer**: I mean.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I'm not sure how I feel about pushing the envelope.
**Bclymer**: There's got to be a better way to say that.
**Bclymer**: Because I guess my thought is when I hear you say, like, pushing the envelope, that might mean skirting or cutting corners.
**Ataylor**: Okay, gotcha.
**Bclymer**: So we could just say, be urgent early.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, be urgent early.
**Bclymer**: You know, I mean, in reality, it's like, you know, be urgent early.
**Bclymer**: Like, do the things you can do as soon as you can do them.
**Bclymer**: Otherwise, you'll get controlled by the things that you don't see coming.
**Bclymer**: Or, you know, so be early.
**Bclymer**: Do the things.
**Bclymer**: Do the things now that you can do.
**Bclymer**: Do the things now that are in your control.
**Bclymer**: Because if you delay, you'll get.
**Bclymer**: You'll get wrecked or you'll get.
**Ataylor**: Or blindsided.
**Bclymer**: You'll get.
**Bclymer**: Might say.
**Bclymer**: Rex, you'll get.
**Bclymer**: You'll get.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Oh, there you go.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, there you go.
**Bclymer**: You'll get blindsided by the things you can't control.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Okay, I will shift that so it's more exactly to those.
**Ataylor**: To that quote.
**Ataylor**: And then the caption is quite small in construction.
**Ataylor**: If one thing slips, another follows, and before you know it, you're out of time.
**Ataylor**: Excuse the dog in the background if you can hear him.
**Ataylor**: Our CEO Brandon leads every project with one rule.
**Ataylor**: Be urgent early, because handling the knowns up front is what makes space for the unknowns later.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: I would just say that we said leads approach with one rule.
**Bclymer**: We have a lot more than that.
**Bclymer**: But I'd say a guiding principle.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: With one prince.
**Ataylor**: With.
**Ataylor**: With this principle.
**Ataylor**: And then it's not saying.
**Ataylor**: It's just one.
**Bclymer**: Just say.
**Bclymer**: Just be like.
**Bclymer**: Like, you could say like, you know, one of the guiding principles, you know that our CEO Vernon, blah, blah, like, is be urgent early, you know, or whatever it is that you said.
**Ataylor**: Okay, I will rephrase that.
**Ataylor**: Okay, great.
**Ataylor**: And so those are all good to go.
**Ataylor**: Get that together.
**Ataylor**: And then the only two things that are outstanding for this month, besides the drone videos, which I will send, are the why we build video and these buyer health photos, which you already went over, so get this tab.
**Ataylor**: Okay, so we talked about that.
**Ataylor**: The Westfield Drone collect videos are coming.
**Ataylor**: Okay?
**Ataylor**: The main.
**Ataylor**: The May newsletter will come this week for you to approve, hopefully by tomorrow or Thursday.
**Ataylor**: And then also the why we build video as well.
**Ataylor**: And then next month, the June content will include the new team highlight.
**Ataylor**: So, Maria, if you can get a new headshot from Jose and then anyone else who's a new team member, so.
**Victoria**: We skipped Jose, Fatima, and there's a new assistant project manager, Keva, so he's going to get it next week, so I'll get that to you.
**Victoria**: And then I think that's it.
**Victoria**: So I'll ask Fatima.
**Victoria**: She's been.
**Victoria**: She hasn't sent me her photo yet.
**Victoria**: So these three people will be kind of like, you know, new additions to the team.
**Ataylor**: Okay, great.
**Ataylor**: And then what was this last person's name?
**Ataylor**: I don't think I spelled Kevin.
**Victoria**: I'll text it.
**Bclymer**: Here, you're gonna.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, you're gonna have to write it down.
**Victoria**: Yeah, There you go.
**Victoria**: Because it's a little bit tricky.
**Victoria**: I don't know if it's Kiva or Kiva.
**Victoria**: So, you know.
**Ataylor**: Sure.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: That's perfect.
**Ataylor**: Okay, that is it for today.
**Ataylor**: I'll be getting a couple of things to you this week, and we'll be in touch about approvals and things like that.
**Bclymer**: All right, perfect.
**Victoria**: Awesome question.
**Victoria**: For the newsletter for June, we're going to add the magazine for Brandon, correct?
**Ataylor**: Yeah, yeah, that's on the list there.
**Victoria**: You have everything, right?
**Ataylor**: I have everything, yeah.
**Ataylor**: And it should all send it to you, and you can make sure that everything's on there.
**Victoria**: But, yeah, if you need anything, I'm here.
**Victoria**: Okay.
**Victoria**: Awesome.
**Victoria**: Thank you, guys.
**Victoria**: Thank you, Anika.
