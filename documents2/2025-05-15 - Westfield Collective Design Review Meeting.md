## Transcript
**Bclymer**: I think we're just waiting on Nick.
**Bclymer**: I sent him a request to jump on here, but get into it real quick.
**Bclymer**: Knock this out.
**Bclymer**: We got.
**Bclymer**: Jeff was not able to make it today either.
**Bclymer**: So start off.
**Bclymer**: So, Jerrica.
**Bclymer**: Jerrica jumped on.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Just checking in on the mezzanine reinforcement plan.
**Jdawson**: Yes, we are working through that, and we'll have something issued very soon, hopefully end of week.
**Bclymer**: Is that just going to come out with whatever you're going to update with Jeff?
**Jdawson**: Yes, that's kind of the goal.
**Jdawson**: So we don't have too many revisions out there, but.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: What's the intent for the.
**Bclymer**: For the new wall at the bathroom?
**Bclymer**: How are we doing a thickened slab?
**Bclymer**: Are we doing.
**Bclymer**: We're not going to do the masonry that you guys talked about.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: I think I need to coordinate with Jeff a little bit more on this one.
**Jdawson**: If it is not masonry, then, yeah, we could probably just do like a turndown slab similar to other areas and have it bare on top of it, maybe make it a little bit wider.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Jeff had mentioned maybe doing a curb to set the sill plate on, so it's not sitting right on the slab since it's right there on the outside.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: You think about that?
**Nbigler**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we'll.
**Jdawson**: We'll show that as well.
**Nbigler**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Did Nick jump on?
**Nbigler**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, that was just kind of the final question there.
**Nbigler**: We're.
**Bclymer**: We're too far to put a grade beam in and put that, you know.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Stone up on there at this point, so.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: As far as.
**Bclymer**: That's pretty much it, Jerrica.
**Bclymer**: I guess for structural stuff right here.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, it is just whenever Nick jumps on, just kind of an estimate of when we can get those calculations and building drawings from him for us to review.
**Bclymer**: Those are due tomorrow.
**Jdawson**: Due tomorrow.
**Jdawson**: Okay, perfect.
**Jdawson**: Thanks.
**Nbigler**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: All right, Move real quick onto the architectural design and we'll wrap it up.
**Bclymer**: Air curtains being added to all seven doors.
**Bclymer**: Dean has that information.
**Bclymer**: I sent out the specs last Friday for the air curtains that we found to fit.
**Bclymer**: So Jeff's working on getting those in the plans, and then Dean is going to get those added.
**Bclymer**: They are doing a handful of ads to their electrical plans.
**Bclymer**: Those are listed down here.
**Bclymer**: They're adding the air curtains.
**Bclymer**: The fans are going to get power for the fans on their plan.
**Bclymer**: Why did I write bathroom lighting?
**Bclymer**: Alex, did you have a specific bathroom lighting that we talked about yesterday in addition to the added bathroom?
**Bclymer**: You there, Alex?
**Nbigler**: Okay, can't hear you.
**Bclymer**: Anyways, we will be sending.
**Bclymer**: When Jerrica have or Nick sends in his stuff and you get your updated plans that Jeff will resubmit to cdr.
**Bclymer**: That'll keep us going with our building permit at least for foundations.
**Bclymer**: You there, Alex?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, we can't hear you, man.
**Bclymer**: Sounds like you can hear me.
**Bclymer**: So, just so you know, Ashton does not need anything updated on the civil plans for that extra.
**Bclymer**: That extra line going from the transformer to your distribution panel on the volleyball side.
**Bclymer**: He said he's good on that.
**Bclymer**: Saw Bo jump on here from the captivair.
**Bclymer**: Does anybody on the captivaire the kitchen side need any further coordination?
**Bclymer**: Are you guys.
**Awoodhams**: I.
**Awoodhams**: I don't believe so.
**Awoodhams**: I was just on here to make sure nothing was happening.
**Awoodhams**: It doesn't affect us.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, no.
**Bclymer**: We got you guys going through the wall and we'll do the fire fireproofing around your penetrations.
**Bclymer**: The fire caulking.
**Nbigler**: So.
**Bclymer**: I think you guys are good.
**Bclymer**: I think that is it.
**Bclymer**: Jeff is working on getting the final.
**Bclymer**: The bathroom mountain.
**Bclymer**: That'll should be the final, final push to get this permit set done.
**Bclymer**: So does anybody else have anything for the design meeting today?
**Nbigler**: All right, thanks, guys.
