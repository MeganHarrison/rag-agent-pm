## Transcript
**Bclymer**: You know, once, you know, I landed in Zurich and got through immigration connected.
**Bclymer**: I mean, I landed in.
**Bclymer**: In here at like, you know, I think three hours later.
**Bclymer**: Ish.
**Bclymer**: You know, so.
**Bclymer**: But I mean, shoot.
**Bclymer**: It took about 45 minutes to get our bags.
**Bclymer**: Such a crappy airport.
**Jdawson**: Oh, whoa.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, so I think it got here around like 8, 10 local time.
**Bclymer**: Ish.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So that's good.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: They sent me the message and I was like, oh, he's not gonna get early checking.
**Jdawson**: But then when you text me, I'm like, oh, I'm glad you got it.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, no, as soon as you texted me, I had just got in the room and showered.
**Jdawson**: That's awesome.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: What did they tell you?
**Jdawson**: Nothing.
**Jdawson**: They were.
**Jdawson**: Because the lady was like, oh, yeah, I think we can make it.
**Jdawson**: And I was like, okay.
**Jdawson**: And then they never reply.
**Jdawson**: And I was like, okay, that's good.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Well, there was an email in my email that says they could do it.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, exactly.
**Jdawson**: But then I saw the other one and I was like, I'm sorry, I don't think you can, you know, it was the last one.
**Jdawson**: I was like, oh.
**Jdawson**: But then I'm glad you got it.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I walked up and to check in, she's like, good news.
**Bclymer**: Is your room's ready?
**Bclymer**: I'm like, sweet.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So cool.
**Bclymer**: All right, let's jump in here.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I don't know if Jesse's going to join.
**Jdawson**: He accepted it, but I'm not sure.
**Bclymer**: No, he's not.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And so.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: So do you feel like you're being compensated appropriately?
**Bclymer**: Why or why not?
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I do.
**Jdawson**: So the thing when I, when I.
**Jdawson**: One of the thing of the things that I wrote is that, you know, since perform is doing the.
**Jdawson**: How do you call, like a three party payment.
**Jdawson**: So obviously from the 20, I'm only getting paid 13.
**Jdawson**: Oh, here it is.
**Jdawson**: So it's like, it's a little bit of annoying, but I get it.
**Jdawson**: I know they have to have the extra thing, but I, I feel like I being compensating.
**Jdawson**: Well, I mean, I don't think it's a problem right now, to be honest.
**Jdawson**: I think it's okay.
**Bclymer**: So one thing I was, you know, looking at, do you.
**Bclymer**: So, So I know, you know, perform has their, their markup or whatever.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: You know, I don't know how we, like, what do they do, you know, as far as.
**Bclymer**: Is there anything that they do or is that just their markup or like, do they give you any kind of training?
**Bclymer**: Like, what is the value that extra dollars Are.
**Bclymer**: Do they do anything?
**Jdawson**: No, I mean, to be honest with you, they are very, very professional in the way of, you know, trying to find people.
**Jdawson**: And they kind of do like trainings and background checks and they do like, you know, they make sure that you have a good connection, that you are well located and all the stuff.
**Jdawson**: And then they have, you know, the Slack channel.
**Jdawson**: So if, you know, kind of like make you feel connected to perform.
**Jdawson**: But to be honest, I don't connect with them so much because I'm.
**Jdawson**: I feel more towards the company rather than with perform because we have a lot of things to do.
**Jdawson**: So I'm here.
**Jdawson**: And then the only thing that they do, regardless, let's say payment wise, is that they have everything set up for Colombia, so depending on your country.
**Jdawson**: So for example, they have the legal payment, let's say it's not a W9, but I think it's a foreigner employee.
**Jdawson**: Like, it's a.
**Jdawson**: I think it's a F49 form something.
**Jdawson**: So they just have it as in file, like saying that Maria works for an American company, but she works in Colombia.
**Jdawson**: So that's the only thing.
**Jdawson**: Like they kind of have everything there set up.
**Jdawson**: But again, like I was telling you.
**Jdawson**: So for example, they were asking me like, you have a Colombian account?
**Jdawson**: And I was like, no, I actually have a Wells Fargo account.
**Jdawson**: So I can use my, my, you know, my Wells Fargo account because I set it up when I was seven years in United States and I have it there connected and everything.
**Jdawson**: So, so I'm not gonna wait, lose it.
**Jdawson**: You know, they were like, oh, okay, so that's gonna take, you know, so things like that.
**Jdawson**: But the only thing I will say legally they do is just having that form that it's like if, if anything, like Maria, it's working in Colombia, but she works for an American company.
**Jdawson**: But other than that, it's.
**Jdawson**: It's just, you know, no trainings, no nothing.
**Jdawson**: It's just like, it's.
**Jdawson**: I don't know, it's hog do day.
**Jdawson**: So they kind of work on Slack.
**Jdawson**: It's hot dog day.
**Jdawson**: So let's just talk about it, all that.
**Jdawson**: Things like that, but that's it.
**Bclymer**: All right, well, day.
**Speaker 2**: Is that what you.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jdawson**: They can find like weird days.
**Jdawson**: I was like, oh, it's hot dog day.
**Speaker 2**: That's a, that's actually a paid holiday in Puerto Rico.
**Jdawson**: Oh.
**Bclymer**: That'S a different kind of hot dog.
**Bclymer**: Okay, the.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: So I'll send you.
**Bclymer**: I'll send you our master agreement and everything with them, because I Was kind of reading through it, you know, when I was going through this question, trying to figure it out.
**Bclymer**: And I don't necessarily see a cancellation clause or anything.
**Bclymer**: And I asked them what it would to essentially, you know, buy your contract out.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Which they.
**Bclymer**: They quoted me at over $50,000.
**Bclymer**: I was like, that's ridiculous.
**Bclymer**: That's what?
**Bclymer**: That's outrageous.
**Speaker 2**: So many hours worked for a company and as a temp service, then you can hire them.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And they don't have any.
**Bclymer**: At least I couldn't find anything like that.
**Bclymer**: But I also didn't see anything where, like, if I cancel them tomorrow, that prevents me from hiring you direct.
**Jdawson**: Gotcha.
**Bclymer**: So I'll send you that stuff and then, you know, you can.
**Bclymer**: You can peruse through it and see what you can find, you know, and then, you know, we'll see what our options are.
**Jdawson**: Sounds good.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So have you made any costly mistakes?
**Bclymer**: If so, what were they?
**Jdawson**: Not right now.
**Jdawson**: I hope not to.
**Jdawson**: But no, honestly, everything.
**Jdawson**: It's been.
**Jdawson**: I kind of like always kind of like ask you double time if we're booking these.
**Jdawson**: These.
**Jdawson**: But other than that, I don't think I have so far.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I mean, I don't, you know, I don't think you have either now.
**Bclymer**: You know, I think one thing that, you know, coming out of this, you know.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Meeting is I want to put more things that you're accountable for.
**Bclymer**: You know, for instance, like we have, you know, we've had the issues where insurance doesn't get paid, and then I got to get on a call and, you know, tear everybody new asshole because our insurance is canceled, you know, so I want to, you know, put things to where, like, you have a little bit more responsibility, you know, and you're looking at that so that, you know, that's a big risk for our company.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: That's why I was so pissed off about it.
**Bclymer**: To not have that means, you know, our policy gets canceled, that we have a gap, something happens.
**Bclymer**: I mean, we're shutting our doors.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: So again, not.
**Bclymer**: Not your fault.
**Bclymer**: Really Mine?
**Bclymer**: Because, you know, I wasn't clear about who's.
**Bclymer**: Who's responsible for that.
**Bclymer**: Have you done things above and beyond your position to save, make the company money?
**Bclymer**: If so, what were they?
**Bclymer**: You said I can consistently look for cost effective options when making purchases unless a specific item is required.
**Bclymer**: I also take initiative to pursue refunds when possible to help reduce expenses and maximize value.
**Bclymer**: So, yeah, I would say yes, you do things above and beyond your position.
**Bclymer**: I mean, I know that just like whenever we sponsor events and you're making sure that things happen, you're checking and making sure Jesse and I are taken care of.
**Bclymer**: That's, you know, much appreciative.
**Bclymer**: And, and I think you do a great job.
**Bclymer**: And, and it's, it's, you know, I'm a mess.
**Speaker 2**: So that's above and beyond anything, just getting me through the day.
**Bclymer**: So, yes, honestly, with, with somebody at, at Jesse's age, just to get them to where they're not peeing themselves through the day is a masterpiece.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, thanks for getting those depends reoccurring shipments to the office here.
**Speaker 2**: That saves me a lot of time.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, so again, I, I, I can't stress enough.
**Bclymer**: I, I appreciate it.
**Bclymer**: I know Jesse does too.
**Bclymer**: We think very highly of you.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I think hopefully with, you know, one of the comments I, you know, one of that whole kin thing happened and I, I talked to Jesse and you know, I was like, does Ken think that I value him more than Maria?
**Bclymer**: Because it's not even close, you know, which is why he got fired the next day.
**Jdawson**: I mean, that was too much.
**Jdawson**: And you know, I was like, this guy.
**Jdawson**: And I was thinking like, should I?
**Jdawson**: And I was like, poor guy.
**Jdawson**: But I was thinking, you know, because we were hiring more people speaking Spanish, I was like, wow, the moment he interacts with them, it's gonna be a mess.
**Jdawson**: And I was like, no.
**Bclymer**: So, yeah, so definitely appreciate all your hard work and everything that you do.
**Bclymer**: Let's see here.
**Bclymer**: What are you doing?
**Bclymer**: Well, I believe I'm performing well.
**Bclymer**: My role is HR Executive Assistant, Marketing support by keeping operations organized, meeting deadlines constantly and proactively learning the various platforms and processes we use, including licenses and other compliance related tasks.
**Bclymer**: I would agree.
**Bclymer**: You know, you're, you're wearing a lot of hats.
**Bclymer**: You know, that's, that's definitely very appreciative.
**Bclymer**: You, you've done very well at adapting to different things that we throw at you.
**Bclymer**: You know, there is no, no playbook that we give you.
**Bclymer**: So again, doing very well at balancing all that.
**Bclymer**: And you know, we're, we're looking at actually, you know, probably hiring another admin that would be based out of the St.
**Bclymer**: Pete office.
**Bclymer**: So that I think that would help with a lot of things.
**Speaker 2**: I have that.
**Speaker 2**: She, a girl that used to work for Valor.
**Speaker 2**: She'd be a good hire for that.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: So, yeah, like I said, we'll, we'll go.
**Bclymer**: Like I said, we've got got some options.
**Bclymer**: That's one thing that we've tossed around that, you know, I think we'll probably more than likely, you know, pull the trigger on here, you know, coming up, you know, in the next, you know, within the next month.
**Bclymer**: I would say, like I said, Jesse and I will kind of talk, talk about it and trying to structure it and I'm trying to work on, you know, a little back of house organizational stuff as you've seen in our different calls, try to get that structured and let's see here.
**Bclymer**: So where can you improve?
**Bclymer**: I can improve to deepening my knowledge of AI and explore how it can be applied to meet the company's evolving needs.
**Bclymer**: I also aim to continue improving my proficiency and Notion and stay current with the latest trends and solutions.
**Bclymer**: To say I like to provide more support to Brandon with managing and optimizing the marketing emails he receives.
**Bclymer**: Okay, that's great.
**Bclymer**: So, you know, you know, one thing I, I had is there, you know, is there any kind of training or anything that you could use to help you get better?
**Bclymer**: You know, like, is any kind of courses or anything that we could purchase?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, so actually I was doing and you know, there's a payload guy that actually is super proficient in Notion.
**Jdawson**: And once I have time, for example, on the weekends and at nights I try to see the new trends on notion on YouTube.
**Jdawson**: But I know there's, I think some courses that you can take.
**Jdawson**: I think it's in Udemy or something like that.
**Jdawson**: So I'll send you the link.
**Jdawson**: They're not very expensive at all.
**Jdawson**: And it's actually 12 hours and that's, it's actually very good.
**Jdawson**: So yeah, we can take those from Notion or for other type of, you know, programs that you think I will learn.
**Jdawson**: But right now, right now I know Notion is the main thing to have everything, so I want to make sure we are also, you know, complying with that.
**Jdawson**: But yeah, I know I, once in a while I take, you know, the channel and I'm like, oh, let's see.
**Jdawson**: Because I have the reminders on my YouTube channel.
**Jdawson**: So every time he posts a new video, I'm like, okay, let's check it out.
**Jdawson**: But other than that, I think we can take four courses.
**Jdawson**: I'm pretty sure there's one new to me.
**Bclymer**: There's what?
**Bclymer**: There's one what?
**Jdawson**: There's one course, I think in Udemy.
**Jdawson**: Udemy.
**Jdawson**: I think it's a notion.
**Jdawson**: I think I found.
**Jdawson**: I'll find it and I'll send it to you.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, Master Notion.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I got it.
**Jdawson**: I'll send it to you.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: Well, perfect.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: We obviously want to give you the resources, you know, to get better and to grow.
**Bclymer**: You know, I'd say, you know, as far as things that I, I see areas that you could improve on a little bit.
**Bclymer**: You know, sometimes, you know, in meetings or anything we're doing, like, you'll be quick to jump in.
**Bclymer**: You know, I would encourage you to, to pause for a minute and to listen to the entire thing before you say, oh, yeah, and like, try to, you know, essentially get to the end before they're at the end.
**Bclymer**: That's just a kind of a growing thing I would see is as you grow a business, it's usually better to just take a pause and let everything speak and then you can say whatever it is.
**Bclymer**: So, yeah, I would say that's something that you could just be more cognizant of.
**Bclymer**: It's going to help you go a long way.
**Bclymer**: It's going to make people feel heard more, you know, especially as you start to manage people.
**Bclymer**: And then, you know, as far as organization, I think you're pretty good at that.
**Bclymer**: I think what, what, what we want to make sure is, is that you're putting things down.
**Bclymer**: You know, essentially the, the departments, right.
**Bclymer**: Like, guys, here's what we're doing.
**Bclymer**: Like, and you're tracking what needs to be done.
**Bclymer**: So, like, if you notice, like most of my time anymore is literally just following up on, hey, where are you at on this?
**Bclymer**: What is this?
**Bclymer**: What is this?
**Bclymer**: And I'm like, everybody's reminder list, you know, and so that's, you know, a big reason why I'm like, let's get stuff in notion because I can't be everybody's reminder list all the time.
**Bclymer**: And so, you know, for you, like, again, like, as you, as you're like looking at, you know, all these things that you're managing, having the list and tracking what needs to be done.
**Bclymer**: And that organization, I think, is going to really help you, you know, grow and understand where different things are and following up with people.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Jesse, anything?
**Speaker 2**: No, it's the.
**Speaker 2**: You've been tremendously helpful.
**Speaker 2**: I thought just everything you're doing and I didn't.
**Speaker 2**: Shame on me.
**Speaker 2**: I didn't realize you were just here for advertising or marketing.
**Speaker 2**: I thought you were here to do everything else.
**Speaker 2**: So that's.
**Speaker 2**: That's pretty awesome that you just.
**Speaker 2**: How did that happen?
**Bclymer**: I don't know.
**Speaker 2**: How that happened was like, well, can you do this too?
**Speaker 2**: And this too, and just keep adding things on and.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I mean, essentially when she first, you know, interviewed it Was, you know, is marketing.
**Bclymer**: But I was also like, hey, like I don't have a full time marketing gig.
**Bclymer**: Would you be okay with doing executive assistant role as well?
**Bclymer**: And it morphed into, oh, by the way, can you handle risk management and can you help with, can you do all this stuff?
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, admin.
**Bclymer**: So she's been very good about just jumping into it and it's much appreciative.
**Speaker 2**: See, that's awesome.
**Speaker 2**: And it's unfortunate with like Armando that like all we wanted him to was be an estimator, which he said he could do.
**Speaker 2**: And he couldn't even do that, much less us put anything extra on him.
**Speaker 2**: So that's just the difference.
**Speaker 2**: And people in this world, so we, I, I definitely appreciate you.
**Speaker 2**: I'm a, you're a big help, of course.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so you know, where do you, what do you like that your manager does?
**Bclymer**: I appreciate my manager's strong communication skills, focus on automation and clarity.
**Bclymer**: He provides around the company goals and direction.
**Bclymer**: I also admire his eagerness to learn, his forward thinking mindset, and his ability to consistently provide effective solutions that support our growth.
**Bclymer**: Who do you work for?
**Jdawson**: I was thinking about Jesse.
**Speaker 2**: I was, well, I'm horrible at learning anything new.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I thought it was Jesse until you started saying, hey.
**Jdawson**: I'm like, no, you know, you're really good.
**Jdawson**: I honestly appreciate that you are a solutions person.
**Jdawson**: Like, you know, there's a problem and you're like, okay, let's jump back at it.
**Jdawson**: Like, what can I do?
**Jdawson**: And I'm like, wow, I really want to learn that too.
**Jdawson**: So that what I really admire of you sometimes, it just stuck so much on the problem and like what happened?
**Jdawson**: Who did the problem?
**Jdawson**: Like, you know, like kind of like analyzing the problem.
**Jdawson**: But you're like, no, okay, that's a problem.
**Jdawson**: Okay, let's move on.
**Jdawson**: What can we do?
**Jdawson**: So that's really, really cool.
**Bclymer**: Good, good.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, we, you know, Jesse and I, you know, we've been through the trenches together.
**Bclymer**: And so, you know, one thing that, you know, we both do a lot is like things happen.
**Bclymer**: We understand that, you know, but we're paid on results and so we have to figure it out.
**Bclymer**: It doesn't matter who did it or why or whatever.
**Bclymer**: We just need to get it fixed.
**Bclymer**: And then we'll go back and say, all right, how did this happen?
**Bclymer**: How do we prevent it from happening again?
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So where can your manager improve as the company continues to grow?
**Bclymer**: One area of potential improvement could be increasing opportunities for team check ins or feedback sessions.
**Bclymer**: Perhaps through biweekie scrum meetings to ensure alignment, collaboration and continuous improvement.
**Bclymer**: So I, you know, one of my notes on here is what's a scrum meeting?
**Bclymer**: And what does that look like?
**Jdawson**: So I was thinking, because sometimes of the guys, so I don't know how they're well aligned with the things that we're doing with the company.
**Jdawson**: So for example, if we have 15 minutes Mondays, I don't know what is.
**Jdawson**: What's still doing.
**Jdawson**: What is doing that.
**Jdawson**: Okay, good guys.
**Jdawson**: So I know you guys have like this conversation, but I don't know if in your in the area it's okay to have it because probably for example, Kendra is in Texas and Mike is in New Jersey.
**Jdawson**: So things like that.
**Jdawson**: So I don't know if quick check ins in that like what are the guys doing?
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And just like hey Canon, don't forget to send me these says super, super quick.
**Jdawson**: So this crumbs, you know, usually take like 30 minutes maximum.
**Jdawson**: But something super quick about their projects, for example, that can be an opportunity for them to say hey, I'm missing these.
**Jdawson**: Or for example, Jack was telling me that he wanted to have the fence with the logos, you know, with the Alito logos.
**Jdawson**: And then he asked me for it and I'm like, I have no idea.
**Jdawson**: Let's figure out with the Westfield team because I know they have it.
**Jdawson**: So they, they send it.
**Jdawson**: And they were like, no, the fence.
**Jdawson**: And I was connecting them to Jack and I'm like, okay, so they use this company.
**Jdawson**: Can the company do it?
**Jdawson**: I'll send you the logo so we can bring them.
**Jdawson**: So finally the company, the fence company is going to bring the logo so Jack can put them there in the.
**Jdawson**: So things like that.
**Jdawson**: So sometimes can be like hey Jack.
**Jdawson**: Or you know, kind of like connecting each other.
**Jdawson**: I don't know how well of idea would be.
**Speaker 2**: You know, as like we're growing like crazy fast.
**Speaker 2**: So before, you know, when I started it was Brandon, AJ and Alex.
**Speaker 2**: So there wasn't really a whole lot to not know.
**Speaker 2**: But you know, we just hired this guy Jesse, who's awesome and you know that's a senior PM role which he'll manage half the jobs in the company and he'll be talking to all those team people every day or more.
**Speaker 2**: And then if AJ can get into his position where he's doing that, you know, those are the teams you start breaking out that handle those type of things.
**Speaker 2**: Like, you know, they got their own little world that they got someone to check in every day with and just because obviously Me and Brandon can't do that.
**Speaker 2**: There's too many people or that's all we'd be doing is checking in every day.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah, I think you know what you're talking about.
**Bclymer**: You know, if makes sense, like doing it on a company level, I don't think would make sense.
**Bclymer**: Now what we, what we do and what we talk about is, is really on a project level.
**Bclymer**: So every day that project team is getting together, you know, and right now Jesse every morning talks to almost everybody in the company.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Like so, like, you know, I, I typically won't try to call Jesse until, you know, 7:30 or 8 because I know that he's calling other guys in the morning on his way in.
**Bclymer**: And so that's what he's talking is like now that'll, you know, like so some of these, a lot of these jobs, like we'll revert to where those guys and jet Jesse are, are, are talking in the morning.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: And so he's managing two or three or four project teams and he's essentially having those morning daily huddles.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so, so yeah, so yes, I, I that understanding, if that's what you mean by scrub, we just call it like a daily huddle.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So that's one thing that you know, that we do with project teams.
**Bclymer**: You know, again, not, not necessarily Jesse and I, but you know, the project teams go down now.
**Bclymer**: We jump in when we can, but we can't be in every single one.
**Bclymer**: You know, I, but you know, one, I think one common thread.
**Bclymer**: And Jesse, you can correct me if I'm wrong here, that we've seen as we go through these with everybody is, you know, we aren't doing a great job of putting communication out to the team as far as company direction and what we got going on, I mean again to Jesse's point, you know, we are, we are doing a, you know, a good job of growing.
**Bclymer**: I know that even though I, I say that, oh, we don't have any space, the next thing you know I'm like on a call about another billion dollar job in North Carolina, like trying to land it and like doing all this.
**Bclymer**: And so, you know, we just keep getting stuff and we get, you know, Jesse and I will get bogged down in the weeds.
**Bclymer**: I'm like, all right, let's go, let's get this done.
**Bclymer**: And so yeah, we need to, to schedule, you know, I'd say like either quarterly meetings or maybe we do a semi annual meeting, you know, in person, but some, something to, to communicate company wide I don't know if maybe that looks like a video series where like, you know, maybe once a month, you know, we're putting together just a little, you know, five minute thing of where's Alito going?
**Bclymer**: What's going on?
**Bclymer**: And where we highlight, you know, people that are doing really well.
**Bclymer**: You know, maybe we say like, here's a lesson learned or here's an example, like some.
**Bclymer**: Something like that.
**Bclymer**: I don't know.
**Bclymer**: I mean, that might be a great way, especially since we're again, like we built this company kind of reverse of what most companies do.
**Bclymer**: Like most companies will build one office and they'll grow out of that office for five or 10 years and then they might go out.
**Bclymer**: Well, we started off around the country and.
**Bclymer**: And you know, we.
**Bclymer**: So now we're very spread out, which is great.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So, I mean, Jesse, what do you think?
**Speaker 2**: I.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, I think that would be helpful.
**Speaker 2**: I think it's cool when you talk about, you know, because we got people all over.
**Speaker 2**: It'd almost be nice because you.
**Speaker 2**: That map you made for like where we're GC licensed at, like something similar, like, you know, here's the team, like here's a project map of what we have going and then a project Mac of these are in pre construction and development.
**Speaker 2**: These are potential projects.
**Speaker 2**: That way, you know, everyone could see like we got all this going on all over the place.
**Speaker 2**: And so.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I like, I like that map.
**Bclymer**: That, that's.
**Bclymer**: That.
**Bclymer**: I like.
**Jdawson**: One of the things that I think it's important is because some of the people I've learned that during the, you know, the companies I've worked before, some people really feel connected to the company and they don't want to feel like they're just doing their job and that's it.
**Jdawson**: They want to know about the company.
**Jdawson**: Like, what are we, how are we doing?
**Jdawson**: For example, a license, you know, now we have a license here and there.
**Jdawson**: And we're growing.
**Jdawson**: So that sense of we are growing.
**Jdawson**: It's also some of the.
**Jdawson**: I understand that some employees feel like we are growing, so that's.
**Jdawson**: I have to step up as well, you know, because we are becoming, you know, international.
**Jdawson**: We are becoming, you know, national.
**Jdawson**: So those type of things also help people to understand the company, their support to the company and all that stuff.
**Jdawson**: So it's good.
**Jdawson**: I know some people don't care about it, but I know some other employees are like, no, I want to know about the company so we can have it.
**Jdawson**: I think it's a good idea.
**Jdawson**: Like, you Said maybe like you said, no quarterly, but semiannual or something like that.
**Jdawson**: Like half of the year.
**Jdawson**: All the stuff will be great or something like that.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And then again, I think the, the video series might, might be good.
**Bclymer**: Just a little five minute, you know, maybe every two weeks or monthly or something like that put together.
**Bclymer**: So let's, let's start to brainstorm that maybe and get something put together on that and then get that.
**Bclymer**: I like, I like the map idea that Jesse said yes.
**Bclymer**: And then one thing I was thinking is like, you know, we need to probably have like, employee like, appreciation.
**Bclymer**: Like, you know, where, like for instance, like, like Jesse, like maybe you know, Friday, you know, you take, you know, everybody in the, in the St.
**Bclymer**: Pete office, you know, out for, you know, whatever it.
**Bclymer**: Top golf, shoot clay pigeons, like something, whatever fun thing.
**Speaker 2**: Fishing.
**Bclymer**: Fishing, whatever.
**Bclymer**: Something, you know, just, just for more of a, you know, more of a fun thing.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Speaker 2**: Or I forget.
**Speaker 2**: Just Ahmad called me this morning.
**Speaker 2**: He wants, he's going to get us lined up with another job.
**Speaker 2**: New York City with exotech.
**Bclymer**: Nice.
**Speaker 2**: New York City or New York State.
**Speaker 2**: I don't know, somewhere.
**Bclymer**: Okay, that would make sense.
**Bclymer**: I was like, New York City.
**Bclymer**: Good.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Except we, I, I know that New York.
**Bclymer**: We have to double check on that GC license because it's.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I know it's not on the mascot.
**Speaker 2**: How is Arizona?
**Bclymer**: Yes, speaking of GC licenses, how we heard back from Arizona.
**Bclymer**: Maria.
**Jdawson**: Can you hear me?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, so I sent it to Rachel.
**Jdawson**: So she's our Arizona license girl, so everything is correct.
**Jdawson**: So yesterday she didn't send me anything, so I was selling to Jesse if she didn't send me anything.
**Jdawson**: I'm going to keep following up with her every day.
**Jdawson**: So she has everything, like everything in terms of bond, everything of your experience.
**Jdawson**: So she accepted it.
**Jdawson**: Everything.
**Jdawson**: So the only thing that is missing now is just a matter of having the actual license.
**Jdawson**: So I'm going to ask her, send her right now.
**Jdawson**: The, the follow up, like, hey, Rachel, what else is missing?
**Jdawson**: We need this asap because now I.
**Speaker 2**: Just don't want it.
**Speaker 2**: If there's other GCs bidding this Arizona job, I don't want us getting in trouble if they find out.
**Speaker 2**: And then they look us up and they're like, oh, there shouldn't even be soliciting bids in the state.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, no, let me talk to her and everybody.
**Jdawson**: Once I have a response, I'll let you know.
**Jdawson**: But I keep calling her, I keep emailing her like, hey, we need this.
**Jdawson**: So far like right now, so.
**Jdawson**: And also with Georgia yesterday, I called them too and I was like, it's been a month already, guys, we need this.
**Jdawson**: And they were like, yeah, yeah, we're reviewing it right now.
**Jdawson**: And I'm like, okay, hurry up because it's been a month.
**Jdawson**: I understand you have modernized more licenses, but we already sent it.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we're reviewing it.
**Jdawson**: And I'm like, okay, keep calling them.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, gotcha.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So, you know, where can.
**Bclymer**: Excuse me.
**Bclymer**: Where do you want to be in five years, you know, personally, Next five years?
**Bclymer**: I aspire to launch my own marketing agency that serves a variety of industries.
**Bclymer**: Combine creativity, strategy, AI and innovation to help businesses grow.
**Bclymer**: I think that's, that's, I think that's great.
**Bclymer**: Did your camera go off or.
**Jdawson**: No, I'm here.
**Jdawson**: I can see you.
**Jdawson**: Do you guys can see me?
**Bclymer**: No, we, we don't, we don't see you.
**Jdawson**: Oh, let me see if I can turn it on and off.
**Jdawson**: I guess, I guess.
**Jdawson**: See you.
**Jdawson**: So my Internet just get lost one second.
**Bclymer**: That's okay.
**Bclymer**: But yeah, so I think that's a, that's a great, you know, aspiration, you know, to have it.
**Bclymer**: I'm, you know, I, I always ask that question and, and most people will say, you know, I want to be whatever, director of ops or whatever, like they want to be something in the company.
**Bclymer**: And the whole point of that question that I ask people, you know, is it's okay that you have an aspiration to start your own company or do that.
**Bclymer**: I mean, I'm an entrepreneur, Jesse's entrepreneur.
**Bclymer**: Like, I'm not mad at anybody to do it.
**Bclymer**: Like, you know, I, I may be your first investor, you know, you know, be a partner with you.
**Bclymer**: So I think that's, that's a, that's a great goal.
**Bclymer**: So how can I help you get there?
**Bclymer**: Right now I'm getting valuable insights into the industry.
**Bclymer**: Messaging, content, strategy and key platforms, all of which are helping me build strong foundation for the future.
**Bclymer**: Being trusted with marketing tasks like managing the website, creating social media content, contributing to magazines and supporting events is giving hands on experience exposures directly aligned with my long term goal of launching my own agency.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, that's great.
**Bclymer**: And you know, obviously I, I'm happy to help you in, in, you know, any kind of business questions or anything you want.
**Bclymer**: Like, you know, I like started a new business, you know, as, you know, it's fun, exciting, you know, there's some things that you would, you probably want to watch out for and make sure that you have Covered, you know, like things like that.
**Bclymer**: But yeah, I mean I, I'm happy to again to help you in any way and if, if you just have questions or you need, you know, just some business coaching advice, something like that, then you know, I'm happy to, happy to lend you any information I may have.
**Jdawson**: Thank you.
**Jdawson**: Brandon.
**Bclymer**: What do you want to ask me that you haven't yet?
**Bclymer**: I'd be interested to know what you see as my biggest strengths and areas for growth.
**Bclymer**: What advice would you give me to continue to develop professionally and make a greater impact within the company?
**Bclymer**: You know, so, you know, I'd say, you know, one thing I always say is like ask yourself, you know, what can I do better today?
**Bclymer**: You know, there's an acronym that I say a lot.
**Bclymer**: Can I C A N I Constant and never ending improvement.
**Bclymer**: You know, so, you know, things that you can do like sops as we grow are getting very important.
**Bclymer**: So every task that we do like you know, especially if it's.
**Bclymer**: We should have a standard operating procedure.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: That's important to have that stuff.
**Speaker 2**: You know, one thing to go along with that.
**Speaker 2**: Brandon, not to cut you off, but this job planner, like this is going to be a big problem if we don't have because honestly their training videos are not that good.
**Speaker 2**: But if we don't get a, A something in writing on how to do the different things, especially when it comes to change orders and things like that, like as we hire more of these guys brand, we're going to go ape.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I mean then, and maybe that, that looks like even like we have our own internal training inside notion that people have access to.
**Bclymer**: So for instance like you know, who's the, who's the best at our, in our company, you know, at doing job planner, you know, maybe that's Nick, you know, or somebody like that.
**Speaker 2**: That's a great idea.
**Speaker 2**: Have to have Maria do some videos with them and get them posted in there.
**Bclymer**: Exactly.
**Bclymer**: And then again just like what I do with Loom where I do the screen share, I showed everybody how to do.
**Bclymer**: So I'd say let's get a training database.
**Bclymer**: And you know, I know that Nick is not the, the best trainer, you know, so maybe if we just understand what people need to know then even if I do the videos.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: But the point is just to get the videos out, you know, like I think that like again I, if you want to reach out to, you know, Nick is the most versed in it.
**Bclymer**: And so if we just get again the, the what, what needs to get done like, here's how submittals, here's change orders, blah, blah, blah, you know, each sop down on paper, you know, and then we can, you know, either I'll do videos or he can do the videos, whatever.
**Bclymer**: But to walk people through how does this work?
**Bclymer**: And then that way, you know, you know, again, just like when I sent that scheduling video out, you know, Chad's like, oh yeah, I've watched that like three times.
**Bclymer**: And how to do this, like it's, it's valuable for people to go in and just press play and re.
**Bclymer**: Watch it over and over again and to learn it.
**Bclymer**: And that way we, if something, you know, people can't say, oh, well, you know, I didn't know how to do that or this.
**Bclymer**: I was like, no, have you gone and looked at the videos?
**Speaker 2**: That's great.
**Speaker 2**: Because then everyone could too get involved if they wanted to do their own video.
**Speaker 2**: And we talked to everybody about, you know, what have they done above and beyond their position.
**Speaker 2**: Well, like that would be it helping us build our, you know what, you.
**Jdawson**: Know what, what will be great.
**Jdawson**: And I think we can do it in Notion.
**Jdawson**: It's Q and A section.
**Jdawson**: So if you go to the Q and A section and you, for example, ask Job Planner, I don't know, submit or bidding.
**Jdawson**: For example, I were talking about with Plan Hub, how to bid on Plan Hub and you search for it and the Notion shows you the sop, some answers or something like if you can grab it from the PDF or if he can grab it from a video.
**Jdawson**: So that'll be really good to go.
**Jdawson**: I'm going to try and check that because it'll be good to have like a Q and a base of the company in general.
**Jdawson**: So how do I, for example, code transactions in Notion and then they will show you the video, SOP the PDF and some, you know, bring in some stuff that it can be useful for you.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, so let's, so yeah, that'd be great.
**Bclymer**: So let's start to build a database in there for training and training database.
**Bclymer**: And then we'll start uploading all of our, you know, we can already put our policies and procedures and SOPs that we do have in there and just keep, keep adding things as needed.
**Bclymer**: So okay, so yeah, so SOPs, as we grow, this is incredibly important.
**Bclymer**: So finding efficiencies and repetitive tasks as, as you notice.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Like as soon as we figured out how to automatically, you know, update our credit card, you know, into acumatica, the next thing I was like, all right, what's the next task that takes forever.
**Bclymer**: Well, reconciliation.
**Bclymer**: All right, how do we automate that?
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: You know, how do we find that?
**Bclymer**: So that's.
**Bclymer**: That's a huge part, you know, of.
**Bclymer**: Of growing and be.
**Bclymer**: Be efficient.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Is eliminating the repetitive tasks, you know, so in applying whatever, you know, new technologies, you know, to.
**Bclymer**: To help with that efficiency, you know, as far as.
**Bclymer**: Again, like, your.
**Bclymer**: Your greater impact.
**Bclymer**: You know what I'd like to do because, you know, Fatima, she's okay, but, I mean, Plum's gonna get a bit phased out here in the next, probably year or so just because, you know, they're gonna not be bringing the same value and just.
**Bclymer**: It doesn't.
**Bclymer**: It's not going to make sense financially.
**Bclymer**: And, you know, I'd like to get you to where you are more involved as far as a supervisor role, essentially, with the county, because I just don't have the time to stay on top of Fritzi and Jose to make sure that they're getting certain things done.
**Bclymer**: I just can't track it.
**Bclymer**: And so I'd like you to start, you know, essentially playing that supervisor role, like.
**Bclymer**: All right, tracking, you know, what are our issues?
**Bclymer**: What's getting dug?
**Bclymer**: Are we making traction, you know, on these things?
**Bclymer**: Like, to where, you know, when we have our weekly accounting meeting, right.
**Bclymer**: It should have an agenda of.
**Bclymer**: All right, here's our.
**Bclymer**: Here's our ongoing, you know, things that we are working on.
**Bclymer**: Here's our current issues.
**Bclymer**: Here's status.
**Bclymer**: Like, it should really be an update that me and Jesse are looking at and answering questions and giving guidance, you know, not, you know, where I'm going through and asking it like these.
**Bclymer**: It should be a little bit more organized.
**Bclymer**: So if you can take that on, you know, and start to.
**Bclymer**: To manage that, that would be very helpful.
**Jdawson**: Okay, we'll do.
**Bclymer**: And then, like I said, the, you know, I think we're going to look at bringing in another admin person, you know, to help and to start building that out.
**Bclymer**: So, yeah, I mean, that.
**Bclymer**: That's the.
**Bclymer**: The stuff that I would like, you know, for you, Jesse.
**Bclymer**: I don't know if there's anything you have.
**Speaker 2**: No, that all sounds good.
**Speaker 2**: That's plenty to do right there.
**Bclymer**: Oh, yeah.
**Speaker 2**: Because I think, like, if you think of that meeting, the Monday meeting, you're getting good at running it anyways.
**Speaker 2**: So, like, if I can't be in there, Brandon, like, you can just keep, you know, just make it happen anyways.
**Speaker 2**: And then when we have people like, you know, Jesse, once he's on board, like, he's really going to be the one that needs to talk through all that and then we can just, you can follow up with us at the end of it.
**Speaker 2**: It'd be great.
**Speaker 2**: Which is the, here's the problems, here's the dates aren't getting made or whatever, you know and you know as we grow too, that'll just be a report we'll get from Jesse or AJ and so on.
**Bclymer**: It'll really, I would imagine it'll start to like Jesse, Jesse will have his own meeting with his teams.
**Bclymer**: AJ will have his meeting with his teams, you know, and whatever that because you know, as we get bigger and bigger it's not going to make sense to have 30 people in there.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, cool.
**Bclymer**: Well like I said, we really appreciate everything that you do.
**Bclymer**: So we're going to give you a thousand dollar bonus here for the mid year and then we're going to go ahead and bump you five, five dollars an hour.
**Bclymer**: So that should put you at 18.50 after perform takes their cut.
**Jdawson**: Gotcha.
**Jdawson**: Okay, thank you Randon.
**Jdawson**: And then let me know if you want to send me the, the thing.
**Jdawson**: I mean you mentioned the, the not the manual but something related, I mean the cancellation policy or something that you wanted to say.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah, I'll send you, I'll send you performs agreement so that you can say that.
**Bclymer**: But like I hope that you know that you know that shows you like how much we appreciate and care about you and the value as part of the team.
**Bclymer**: So yeah, again can't say enough good things about you and so, so fortunate to have you.
**Bclymer**: No.
**Jdawson**: And thank you guys.
**Jdawson**: I've been honestly had no idea anything about construction.
**Jdawson**: I just came here to learn and it's been amazing and very inspirational for you Brandon and also for you Jesse.
**Jdawson**: You guys are great.
**Jdawson**: So I'm here to help you.
**Jdawson**: As I always said, if I can help with anything, let's make it happen and I'm here to do that.
**Jdawson**: So thank you guys.
**Speaker 2**: Thank you.
**Bclymer**: Awesome.
**Bclymer**: Thank you.
**Speaker 2**: Good deal.
**Bclymer**: See you.
**Jdawson**: Bye guys.
