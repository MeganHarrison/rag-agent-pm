## Transcript
**Bclymer**: Well, if you're not able to join, I will show you what I've been working on here.
**Bclymer**: My screen.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so here's a company, Midland Atlantic.
**Bclymer**: I've seen a lot of their signs, but they do development as well.
**Bclymer**: Obviously owned by the Boils, from what I can see.
**Bclymer**: I've met her before.
**Bclymer**: I'm friends with his sister, but I've been reaching out to Sam Boyle.
**Bclymer**: He's more my age, it seems.
**Bclymer**: I don't know much about him, but we've chatted back and forth via email and I sent him a couple dates.
**Bclymer**: So I'm gonna probably grab coffee with him next week.
**Bclymer**: And then also next week I have coffee with a broke.
**Bclymer**: He does some brokerage, but his name is Ryan Sandals.
**Bclymer**: He's with JLL and he got his hands in a lot of things.
**Bclymer**: So I'm grabbing coffee with him and then been looking for something to kind of get my name out there more and get involved, whether it's a charity or whatever it is.
**Bclymer**: And one of them, who Ryan's on is actually, it's called the Goodwill Young Leaders Board or something.
**Bclymer**: And my buddy Alex is on there as well.
**Bclymer**: So I'm going to fill out an application and probably try and get on there.
**Bclymer**: Especially since we do work with Goodwill, I've been trying to think of some other things to go to.
**Bclymer**: What else do I have cooking?
**Bclymer**: Oh, well, because we met with Braun on yesterday, the day before.
**Bclymer**: Well, he's.
**Bclymer**: He's friends with Steve Pittman who owns the Pitman Partners, and I've been trying to get it in with him.
**Bclymer**: I left.
**Bclymer**: I got his number.
**Bclymer**: I had name dropped.
**Bclymer**: Ron, I got his number.
**Bclymer**: I called him, left a message.
**Bclymer**: I'm hoping he calls me back, but especially now that we've met with Ron, I'm gonna push even harder on that.
**Bclymer**: So that's what I got no update on Bo Ha.
**Bclymer**: And I sent him some dates.
**Bclymer**: I'll follow up with him here soon.
**Bclymer**: I'm gonna get a budget to that one property manager here.
**Bclymer**: Yep, that one property manager I went and looked at that job for.
**Bclymer**: I'm gonna get a budget to him tomorrow.
**Bclymer**: And a small one, he said, but there'll be big, big ones to come.
**Bclymer**: I'm assuming if we do that, then we'll be able to do the build out for whoever ends up leasing that space.
**Bclymer**: And then I have that guy that Evan wants to introduce me to.
**Bclymer**: We're probably going to try and golf or do something, you know, I told him I need to be in an afternoon, probably Thursday or Friday next week?
**Bclymer**: Because this guy really likes golf, Evan said.
**Bclymer**: But he's a gas station developer.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: See, you forgot who was on.
