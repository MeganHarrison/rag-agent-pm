## Transcript
**Bryan.sheward**: Kate's out sick today, so we're kind of trains in the night a little bit, but I can speak to this a little bit.
**Bryan.sheward**: I think you and her connected on Friday, isn't that right?
**Kate.polack**: Yeah.
**Kate.polack**: Yeah.
**Kate.polack**: So there's the title.
**Kate.polack**: 13 Comments.
**Bryan.sheward**: Yeah.
**Bryan.sheward**: Which we believe we've addressed kind of all these.
**Bryan.sheward**: But it sounds like the drainage report hadn't been submitted, so he never saw it, which is probably why the comment came through.
**Bryan.sheward**: Did you guys talk about that with Kayla on Friday?
**Kate.polack**: I.
**Kate.polack**: Yeah, she said there's a document that.
**Kate.polack**: That can address this, so.
**Kate.polack**: Yes.
**Bryan.sheward**: So we.
**Kate.polack**: You have.
**Bryan.sheward**: We had.
**Kate.polack**: Go ahead.
**Bryan.sheward**: I was just gonna say we had a drainage memo.
**Bryan.sheward**: And it just.
**Bryan.sheward**: What he's asking for is pretty much everything that's outlined in a drainage memoir.
**Bryan.sheward**: So I think given.
**Bryan.sheward**: Given that we received this comment, it led us to believe he never saw it, I guess, which I.
**Bryan.sheward**: I think that was.
**Bryan.sheward**: Hopefully we could just provide that to him and that should suffice.
**Bryan.sheward**: I was gonna consider just emailing or reaching out to him on the side today, Caden, and sending it to him outside of the full submittal process, just to say, hey, FYI, this is what we got.
**Bryan.sheward**: I mean, we're not really increasing any improvements coverage here.
**Bryan.sheward**: We're just replacing some pavement.
**Bryan.sheward**: So, you know, I would hope he has some reason to not go crazy and pretend that this is like a new developed site, which it's not.
**Bryan.sheward**: So I can.
**Bryan.sheward**: That was on my.
**Bryan.sheward**: My list to reach out to him today, or Kate was, but she's sick today.
**Bryan.sheward**: So I can.
**Bryan.sheward**: I can do it and see if I can get some movement on that.
**Ehillyer**: Okay.
**Kate.polack**: And, Andrew, you're on the call.
**Kate.polack**: How's it going?
**Kate.polack**: Andrew?
**Shoff**: Hey.
**Shoff**: Going off.
**Ehillyer**: Okay.
**Kate.polack**: So Brian said he has all the information for these comments.
**Kate.polack**: It's regarding, like, the disturbed area and storm water.
**Kate.polack**: Another comment on here is they're asking for people involved in the operation and maintenance of the facility.
**Ehillyer**: Did.
**Kate.polack**: Do you have anyone assigned to that yet, Andrew?
**Shoff**: We.
**Shoff**: Yeah, we can.
**Ehillyer**: Okay.
**Bryan.sheward**: Well.
**Bryan.sheward**: And Andrew, this is like everything on this project.
**Bryan.sheward**: It seems like they're pulling in a lot of stuff that doesn't really relate to you.
**Bryan.sheward**: It's more the landlord.
**Shoff**: Yeah.
**Bryan.sheward**: So there should be probably an operations and maintenance manual or some kind of document on ongoing maintenance that the landlord, which should have.
**Bryan.sheward**: And it should be their responsibility.
**Bryan.sheward**: So I'm not sure.
**Bryan.sheward**: Again, we.
**Bryan.sheward**: We had that call, I think, with the.
**Bryan.sheward**: The owner of property and about the easement.
**Bryan.sheward**: I would chalk this up to a similar thing of.
**Bryan.sheward**: I don't want to go and create A new operations and maintenance manual when you're just a tenant.
**Bryan.sheward**: That should be an owner thing, in my opinion.
**Shoff**: Yeah.
**Shoff**: That was a fun call, by the way.
**Shoff**: Never haven't had a call like that in a while.
**Shoff**: Everyone's on the phone and talking over each other.
**Shoff**: Yeah, well, I'll ask him about that.
**Kate.polack**: Okay.
**Kate.polack**: And then there's a site map they're asking for.
**Bryan.sheward**: Yeah, it's a.
**Bryan.sheward**: It would be in the O and M manual.
**Bryan.sheward**: So, Nick, typically the owner of the property should have this, but I have a feeling this property's been around for so long that either they never did have an O and M manual or it's really old.
**Bryan.sheward**: So I consider this stuff, like, out of Goodwill scope.
**Bryan.sheward**: It should be out of your scope.
**Bryan.sheward**: It should be out of my scope.
**Bryan.sheward**: This is a landlord issue.
**Bryan.sheward**: Like, we're being chalked with all kinds of things that are their issue, but, I mean, we're happy to help and solve it, but we don't want to be the tip of the nose controlling the whole body here.
**Bryan.sheward**: If there's already a document in place that talks about maintaining the entire property, we, you know, that's a question that the land or the owner should.
**Bryan.sheward**: Should be able to provide.
**Bryan.sheward**: And if it doesn't exist, then that's fine.
**Bryan.sheward**: But we all.
**Bryan.sheward**: We don't want goodwill or you dictating things that apply to the entire property when they're just a tenant on one of the ends.
**Kate.polack**: Yeah.
**Kate.polack**: Are you in contact with the landlord, Andrew?
**Shoff**: Yeah, I'll have Denise on our side works with the landlord, so I'll have her ask for that.
**Ehillyer**: Okay.
**Shoff**: Does it have to be, like, within a certain time frame or can it be something from 20 years ago or something?
**Kate.polack**: Oh, that.
**Kate.polack**: That.
**Kate.polack**: I'm not sure.
**Bryan.sheward**: They.
**Kate.polack**: They didn't specify.
**Bryan.sheward**: Yeah, so the way this usually works is.
**Bryan.sheward**: And this is the same thing, Andrew, with the easement.
**Bryan.sheward**: It's like there were things that were fine, 5, 10, 15, 20 years ago that now, for one reason or another, need to be updated to current standards.
**Bryan.sheward**: So they're just kind of using this, it seems like, as a mechanism for forcing them to upgrade all their stuff to current standard, including documentation like this.
**Shoff**: Okay, yeah, I'll.
**Shoff**: I'll ask them for it.
**Shoff**: And then.
**Kate.polack**: And then this is probably the landlord as well.
**Kate.polack**: They're.
**Kate.polack**: They're requesting this water easement on the.
**Kate.polack**: On northwest side of Aldi's.
**Shoff**: Oh, yeah.
**Kate.polack**: Yeah.
**Bryan.sheward**: This has nothing to do with your site at all, Andrew, but this is on the complete opposite side of the property, and we don't have survey over there for this.
**Bryan.sheward**: I mean, there's no reason for us to have survey over here.
**Bryan.sheward**: So again, this is what I think needs to happen to be pragmatic.
**Bryan.sheward**: Either the landlord needs to go hire a surveyor to go and address these things, collect survey and bounds legal description and exhibit, and slap it to the front end document that this note insinuates they've sent it to us, which they haven't yet.
**Bryan.sheward**: Brian Blake has not sent us anything that I've seen and get it recorded and resolved.
**Bryan.sheward**: Or if they want to hire the collective team here to incur additional services to do all this stuff for them.
**Bryan.sheward**: I just feel like it shouldn't be your cost, it should be their cost, whether they reimburse you or however that is stuff that's unrelated to your.
**Bryan.sheward**: You're trying to do.
**Shoff**: Yeah, that's pretty crazy.
**Shoff**: Okay, next, across the street.
**Bryan.sheward**: Yeah.
**Kate.polack**: The, the other, the other easement.
**Kate.polack**: Were you getting a letter for the other easement, Andrew?
**Shoff**: Yeah, we asked Friday for an update from them because they were going to provide that.
**Shoff**: It's kind of weird because we're buying it from them, but we haven't purchased it yet.
**Shoff**: So we're kind of in a gray or middle area.
**Shoff**: But yeah, they're working on getting that letter so we can move forward with the easement, basically.
**Kate.polack**: Do you think this can be a letter or.
**Kate.polack**: Brian, does this need to be surveyed and.
**Bryan.sheward**: Well, it.
**Bryan.sheward**: The way his note says is it.
**Bryan.sheward**: It's like they've discovered that there's not an easement, there should be.
**Bryan.sheward**: So he's asking for an easement and in order to properly, you know, craft the shape in space, you got to get the building surveyed so that you don't accidentally put the easement over the top of the building and create an encroachment.
**Bryan.sheward**: So I, Yeah, I.
**Bryan.sheward**: It sounds like it needs to be surveyed and it needs.
**Bryan.sheward**: A document needs to be created and then that document, that legal description needs to be applied, you know, slapped onto a front end document that says, you know, this is an easement for CBU and it needs to get recorded and then a copy of the recorded document sent back to CBU so they can see it's fully completed.
**Bryan.sheward**: It's basically the steps involved if there's some kind of a letter in lieu of.
**Bryan.sheward**: I guess I'm not sure what that would be, but he seems, they seem to be indicating that they want this to be an easement.
**Kate.polack**: Well, what is like the time frame for doing something like that, Brian?
**Bryan.sheward**: So if this is what I had, I'D have to call our surveyor and say, give me, you know, what would it cost you to go out and survey this?
**Bryan.sheward**: They give me a number.
**Bryan.sheward**: I'd come back to the team and ask for, you know, release.
**Bryan.sheward**: And then it probably take them three weeks at the quickest to get it surveyed and data back to me and then create the shape, send it back to them.
**Bryan.sheward**: Say we get a legal description and exhibit within a week of getting the survey back.
**Bryan.sheward**: So that's a month now.
**Bryan.sheward**: And then we all.
**Bryan.sheward**: We do as the civil is, we provide that document typically to a land use attorney.
**Bryan.sheward**: And then a land use attorney, whether that's for the city or.
**Bryan.sheward**: Or the landlord or Goodwill has an attorney, they would then, you know, essentially staple it on as an exhibit to the easement document.
**Bryan.sheward**: They would have to get reviewed by the landlord because the landlord, it would be an encumbrance on their property, so they'd want to look at it and then it would get recorded.
**Bryan.sheward**: So I'd say it's every bit of a.
**Bryan.sheward**: At fastest, you know, maybe five weeks at longest, several months to get me.
**Bryan.sheward**: Sometimes crazy crap comes up that causes people to get squirrely about getting things recorded.
**Bryan.sheward**: But as fat, I mean, as fast as four to six weeks, as slow as maybe a few weeks longer if it's all smooth sailing.
**Bryan.sheward**: But there's a front end need to get the survey, which would be the piece that takes, you know, several weeks to get.
**Bryan.sheward**: Yeah.
**Bryan.sheward**: And I, I mean, my.
**Bryan.sheward**: I would just say, guys, this is a.
**Bryan.sheward**: Unrelated thing to our project.
**Bryan.sheward**: If you want to tie it to like CFO or something, okay.
**Bryan.sheward**: But like, don't.
**Bryan.sheward**: Don't tie us up on the front end.
**Bryan.sheward**: Like, this is unrelated to our project, really.
**Bryan.sheward**: We're happy to work in good faith with the landlord to get it figured out.
**Bryan.sheward**: Yeah.
**Shoff**: So I was going to say, is there a way we can do that?
**Shoff**: Just say, we'll get this done, but let us build first.
**Shoff**: Or.
**Bryan.sheward**: I mean, Yeah, I think that's where you plead with reason.
**Bryan.sheward**: It's their choice, I guess.
**Bryan.sheward**: We ultimately have to get their permission.
**Bryan.sheward**: But I kind of got the sense they were already going to be okay with that kind of an approach for the sewer.
**Bryan.sheward**: He's been out front.
**Ehillyer**: Gosh.
**Kate.polack**: That's the same comment.
**Bryan.sheward**: It's the same thing.
**Kate.polack**: Yeah.
**Bryan.sheward**: Yeah.
**Bryan.sheward**: This is.
**Bryan.sheward**: They're trying to.
**Bryan.sheward**: You're not going to put a detention pond in.
**Bryan.sheward**: You're not going to.
**Bryan.sheward**: I mean, we're not even increasing it.
**Bryan.sheward**: Impervious cover.
**Bryan.sheward**: We're just changing out pavement and regrading it.
**Bryan.sheward**: A little bit.
**Bryan.sheward**: So, yeah, let me call Caden and try to make sure he knows what we've done and just plead reason and then suggest to him that we can work through this other stuff with the easements.
**Bryan.sheward**: But that's brand new to us.
**Bryan.sheward**: We just heard about that.
**Bryan.sheward**: And we don't want that to hold up the show on, you know, fairly simple project here.
**Bryan.sheward**: But if they want to have some teeth to ensure that it actually happens, I'd probably suggest that we tie it to something like a cfo so they can hold it over your head if you don't actually do it, but it allows you to get started.
**Ehillyer**: Okay.
**Kate.polack**: And then there's a comment regarding your erosion control.
**Bryan.sheward**: That's so stupid.
**Bryan.sheward**: He's just saying there's a few things in our typical legend that aren't used, so delete them out of the legend.
**Bryan.sheward**: It doesn't have any impact at all.
**Bryan.sheward**: So, sure, I'll delete a few things.
**Shoff**: That's pretty awesome.
**Kate.polack**: Okay.
**Kate.polack**: When do you think you can have those documents?
**Bryan.sheward**: Let me try to call.
**Bryan.sheward**: Yeah, I mean, I can.
**Bryan.sheward**: We can turn these around, like, really quickly, like tomorrow.
**Bryan.sheward**: I can get you all this stuff, but let me see if I can get a hold of Kaden just to walk them through and making sure.
**Bryan.sheward**: And I'll try to call Blake, Ms.
**Bryan.sheward**: Brian Blake as well, because, you know, we don't have.
**Bryan.sheward**: It insinuates he sent us something, but I don't think he's actually sent us something yet.
**Bryan.sheward**: Can you.
**Bryan.sheward**: Can you scroll back up?
**Bryan.sheward**: I see he made a comment on the survey sheet.
**Bryan.sheward**: Can you.
**Bryan.sheward**: I don't know if I had seen that one.
**Bryan.sheward**: Maybe scroll all the way to the top or.
**Bryan.sheward**: Sorry, page one.
**Bryan.sheward**: Maybe your page two.
**Bryan.sheward**: What's.
**Bryan.sheward**: What's he got on this?
**Bryan.sheward**: Yeah, sorry, go to the next page.
**Bryan.sheward**: Maybe it was just the comment.
**Bryan.sheward**: I've got this too, so I can.
**Bryan.sheward**: Northwest corner parcel.
**Bryan.sheward**: Okay, that's just the one we were just talking about.
**Bryan.sheward**: Okay.
**Bryan.sheward**: So, Andrew, this sewer easement.
**Bryan.sheward**: Am I understanding that you guys are leading the charge on.
**Bryan.sheward**: On that with a letter or what.
**Bryan.sheward**: What is.
**Bryan.sheward**: I think Nick referenced a letter.
**Bryan.sheward**: I wasn't sure where we left that super easement thing right now.
**Shoff**: Yeah, the.
**Shoff**: The landlord's working on drafting something to either say they're going to grant us the easement through a letter, and then we'll take care of that because it's still in that gray area of who owns it or they own it, but we're going to own it.
**Shoff**: So, yeah, we followed with them and then we'll ask that question again once we hear back.
**Shoff**: I haven't seen any response yet, but.
**Bryan.sheward**: Okay, well, given, you know, given this comment here we had talked about, there were, and at least in my opinion, like two ways we could do this.
**Bryan.sheward**: Like, one way was to use the vehicle of the existing 36 foot non, you know, exclusive easement that you kind of see in black behind the red there and then it tapers to a 30 foot as it moves west.
**Bryan.sheward**: You could, I'm not an attorney, but just doing this before, I felt like the easiest thing to do would be to just write, you know, it'd be a legalese type of document, but just some really simple attorney drafted document that said referencing these two easements and specifically naming CBU as a grantee and basically using those shapes as the vehicle for explicitly stating that CBU is a grantee to it.
**Bryan.sheward**: And I figured.
**Bryan.sheward**: And they agreed.
**Bryan.sheward**: The person I had spoken to and said felt like that was acceptable to them.
**Bryan.sheward**: But this markup seems to suggest that they just want to have a proposed new rectangular easement overlapped onto the existing 36 foot easement.
**Bryan.sheward**: So rather than using the vehicle of the previous shape and naming space cbu, this is suggesting like a new easement gets prepared and recorded over the top.
**Bryan.sheward**: So it's like easement on top of easement.
**Bryan.sheward**: Both of those work.
**Bryan.sheward**: In my opinion.
**Bryan.sheward**: It's just a matter of what does the landlord want because it's ultimately their property and their call.
**Bryan.sheward**: And then knowing that nobody can do this unless a surveyor prepares that shape.
**Bryan.sheward**: So if we're the group that people want to hire to prepare the shape, if that's the direction that we go in, we're happy to do it.
**Bryan.sheward**: We would just need direction.
**Bryan.sheward**: And then we usually cost like 800 bucks or something to prepare a meets and bounds legal description exhibit.
**Bryan.sheward**: So it's not that expensive.
**Bryan.sheward**: It's a cost.
**Bryan.sheward**: Takes a handful of hours for the surveyor to do and check and then we hand that shape over to usually, like I said, an attorney who can prepare the document for recording and review at that point.
**Bryan.sheward**: So you just, you guys tell me if you need my help with that, I'm happy to help.
**Bryan.sheward**: Otherwise it sounds like the landlord's maybe in the driver's seat to get that rectified.
**Shoff**: Okay, yeah, we'll, I'll definitely let you know if we go that way.
**Shoff**: It's, it sounds, that makes sense to me that we would do it that way, but yeah, we'll, once we hear back from him.
**Shoff**: Okay, we'll, we'll make a decision.
**Shoff**: There Because.
**Bryan.sheward**: Yeah, let me.
**Shoff**: Pretty easy.
**Shoff**: Easy to work with, so.
**Bryan.sheward**: Yeah.
**Bryan.sheward**: Yeah.
**Bryan.sheward**: So, Nick.
**Bryan.sheward**: Yeah, let me.
**Bryan.sheward**: I guess if we're.
**Bryan.sheward**: If we're wrapped up here, I can try to give Kaden a call here in the next 15 minutes, see if I can connect with him, just to talk him through and hopefully just get this resolved.
**Bryan.sheward**: Because I feel like these are the kind of things just hang around in the background for weeks without resolution because people just aren't paying attention to it.
**Bryan.sheward**: But I can try to get his attention and see if we can close out at least the drainage report aspect.
**Kate.polack**: Okay.
**Kate.polack**: And then you'll send the documents tomorrow, Brian?
**Bryan.sheward**: Yeah, I mean, I can update the plans pretty easily right now.
**Bryan.sheward**: There's not.
**Bryan.sheward**: Not really any impact to the plans other than the title or the.
**Bryan.sheward**: I think the only thing was just that.
**Bryan.sheward**: That legend on the erosion control sheet, which doesn't really impact anything.
**Bryan.sheward**: So.
**Bryan.sheward**: Yeah, I can reprint things tomorrow, but some of these other comments have to get addressed before it sounds like they'll resolve them.
**Bryan.sheward**: And these aren't really civil design things.
**Bryan.sheward**: These are more deal things working out between people.
**Ehillyer**: Yeah.
**Kate.polack**: Okay, well, let us know how your conversation goes, Brian.
**Kate.polack**: Yep.
**Bryan.sheward**: Yep.
**Bryan.sheward**: I'll circle back with you.
**Ehillyer**: Yeah.
**Kate.polack**: All right.
**Kate.polack**: Anything else?
**Bryan.sheward**: So from my side.
**Ehillyer**: Okay.
**Kate.polack**: All right, thanks, guys.
**Kate.polack**: Oh, oh, one other thing, Brian, are you.
**Kate.polack**: Are you okay with.
**Kate.polack**: I was gonna talk about this detail.
**Bryan.sheward**: Yeah, I saw this in order to, like.
**Bryan.sheward**: I like to float these things past people.
**Bryan.sheward**: So the guy at this CBU I talked with about this upgrade, we were going to reach out, send this over to him and just get him on email saying, yeah, this looks good so that we can all feel good about it.
**Bryan.sheward**: So let me.
**Bryan.sheward**: I think we sent the email over to him this morning, but again, Kate.
**Bryan.sheward**: Kate's out today, so let me check with her if she sent it.
**Bryan.sheward**: If not, I'll send it and.
**Bryan.sheward**: And then I'll follow up with him to get his blessing on it.
**Ehillyer**: Okay, sounds good.
**Kate.polack**: Thanks, guys.
**Shoff**: Thanks, guys.
**Shoff**: Appreciate it.
