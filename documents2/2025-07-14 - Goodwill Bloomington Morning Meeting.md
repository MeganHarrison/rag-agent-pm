**Jcurtin**: Oh, he.
**Jcurtin**: He's going to visit.

**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Where at?
**Jcurtin**: In.

**Jcurtin**: Yeah, a couple of them.
**Jcurtin**: Oh, the canopy.
**Jcurtin**: Meet with roofer to verify EFA's.
**Jcurtin**: So Jeremy said that he was gonna reach out to us today.
**Jcurtin**: He told us that.
**Jcurtin**: He told me that.
**Jcurtin**: Was it Thursday or Friday?
**Jcurtin**: He said he would reach out today.
**Jcurtin**: Oh, it's Friday.
**Jcurtin**: He said he'd reach out today with a detail, a sketch detail of what he's proposing as far as a plan for flash and all that.
**Jcurtin**: Okay, let me call him.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: I actually don't have his number.
**Jcurtin**: Do you.
**Jcurtin**: Are you able to.
**Jcurtin**: To call?
**Jdawson**: What's up, dude?
**Jcurtin**: Hey.
**Jcurtin**: Morning, Jenna.
**Jdawson**: How you doing?
**Jcurtin**: Good, good.
**Jcurtin**: I got Nick on the call as well.
**Jcurtin**: We're just reaching out to you.
**Jcurtin**: Just following up about the.
**Jcurtin**: The detail for canopy for today.
**Jcurtin**: I know we talk.
**Jcurtin**: Okay, sweet.
**Jdawson**: So, yeah, come up with something that's manufacturer approved.
**Jcurtin**: Awesome.
**Jcurtin**: Awesome.
**Jcurtin**: And that is that going to be showing your termination at the parapet as well as going up the building?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I'll definitely.
**Jdawson**: The easier one to find is going to be the one on the parapet.
**Jdawson**: The other one's going to possibly be something more difficult to find on just because it's not the, you know, the normal stuff.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Going up and over a pair of it.
**Jdawson**: So all everyday stuff.
**Jdawson**: But that termination on the pyramid might be difficult, but we'll figure something out.
**Jdawson**: If anything.
**Jdawson**: I'll get a.
**Jdawson**: Get on the phone.
**Jdawson**: With elevate stack coordinator and see if I can't draw something up and get them to just kind of give me a verbal.
**Jdawson**: Not a verbal, a written yay or day.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so, yeah, we'll get something, but it may just be a little more difficult than we'd like.
**Jdawson**: Only as easy as just going to find in their parapet multi tubes.
**Jcurtin**: Amen.
**Jdawson**: This is a rocket science.
**Jdawson**: So they have a suggestion that we haven't thought about either, so.
**Jcurtin**: Right on.
**Jcurtin**: Do you, do you know how high your roofing is going to be at where we have to install drains through the, through the parapet wall?
**Jcurtin**: I wanted to coordinate the height with you.
**Jcurtin**: We're framing the parapets right now.
**Jdawson**: You're putting a gutter on that east end of that canopy, right?
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, I think, I think there's going to be like a kind of like a scupper hole through the parapet leading to a gutter.
**Jcurtin**: What.
**Jcurtin**: What's that?
**Jdawson**: Is it just more of an overflow?
**Jdawson**: Is there actually going to be.
**Jdawson**: Do we need a collector box downspout in it?
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, I think there's going to be a gutter and downspout.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: You.
**Jcurtin**: You think it's possible to just do like a scupper through the wall?
**Jcurtin**: And do you think that would work.
**Jdawson**: Instead of a full gutter that whole length?
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, we would still have.
**Jdawson**: The outside edge there on that canopy Was going to have a gutter on it.
**Jcurtin**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: So if you're doing that, I don't know that there's any reason to put some scuppers in, like I said.
**Jdawson**: Unless you're concerned about some overflow.
**Jcurtin**: Well, we, we were just trying to.
**Jcurtin**: I'm just thinking about how the, the water that's on the roof is going to get from the parapet to the gutter.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: So you're going to build parapet walls all the way around, not just on the, the front and the back?
**Jcurtin**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So, yeah, you're gonna have to put some.
**Jdawson**: You're gonna have to put some scuppers in and collector boxes on both sides.
**Jdawson**: And then we may need to bring some tapered insulation down to shove that water to the.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, I want to make sure we, we frame them at, at the right height to.
**Jcurtin**: With your roofing.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, but what about stuff that's going to flow in between the two scupper boxes?
**Jdawson**: It's just going to run to the wall and sit.
**Jdawson**: There's nothing going to divert it to the two scupper boxes.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Let me draw some stuff up and, and then we'll talk.
**Jdawson**: Let's let's plan on talking around lunchtime or maybe a little after and I'll draw some stuff up so you guys can see.
**Jdawson**: Because I think the way that I'm explaining, it's not making a whole lot of sense.
**Jcurtin**: Do you.
**Jcurtin**: You want me to send you a teams meeting?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, go ahead.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: For 11 o'?
**Jcurtin**: Clock?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Almost all day today, so.
**Jcurtin**: Okay, I'll send you a teams meeting.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: Thank you.
**Jdawson**: No problem.
**Jdawson**: Thanks, guys.
**Jcurtin**: Thanks.
**Jcurtin**: Asphalt at the canopy foundations on Tuesday.
**Jcurtin**: You.
**Jcurtin**: You said you're going to talk to them?
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, the sign location.
**Jcurtin**: I added that to the meeting agenda.
**Jcurtin**: This.
**Jcurtin**: We're.
**Jcurtin**: We're meeting with them at.
**Jcurtin**: At 11.
**Jcurtin**: We're meeting with who?
**Jcurtin**: With the roofer for the signage for the drain height and location at the canopy.
**Jcurtin**: Oh, okay.
**Jcurtin**: I thought you said something about the sign.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, and then relocating the door frame.
**Jcurtin**: So he decided he's going to do that on TNM or not relocating the door frame by redoing the block.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, Rocks.
**Jcurtin**: I was gonna redo the block on T M. Are they gonna do that when they do the loading dock?
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, they're gonna do it before or after they.
**Jcurtin**: They do the loading dock?
**Jcurtin**: When they.
**Jcurtin**: When they mobilize to do the loading dock is when David was.
**Jcurtin**: Sorry, hold on.
**Jcurtin**: Sorry.
**Jcurtin**: Finishing the text.
