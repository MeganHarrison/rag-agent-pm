## Transcript
**Jesse**: There he is.
**Jesse**: Hey, Joe.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Hello.
**Bryan.wagar**: Hello.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: I know this, this call got a little bigger than I think was originally planned for.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: But just a quick.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Just for everybody else who's on here, I just wanted to give a quick rundown of everybody on the exotech team.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: I have Zane here, who designed the racking.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Telly is going to be the site supervisor.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Sean is also on the supervising team.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: They will also.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: They will be out there time to time.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Telly will be out there all the time.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: But they've done several of these rackings and you know, worked with the sprinkler companies and you know, make sure that this is going to be a success.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: And then we have Hugo, who is a lead engineer here and he's.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: I think he has a couple concerns that we want to go over as far as the design of the sprinklers.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: So nothing I don't think is major, but I do want to make sure we all get on the same page before we start installation.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Okay, good.
**Cody.page**: We got Chris with.
**Cody.page**: It's Chris on.
**Jesse**: Yes, Chris is.
**Bryan.wagar**: Going.
**Luther.pringle**: Hey, guys, how are you?
**Bryan.wagar**: Good.
**Jesse**: Here we also have Jesse with Adelphia.
**Jesse**: He's going to be the installer.
**Jdawson**: How's it going everybody?
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Perfect.
**Bryan.wagar**: Perfect.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Well, I know it's late on Friday, so if do we.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Are we waiting on anybody else?
**Christopher.w.lopez**: I want to just jump right into it if we can.
**Jesse**: I think we can jump in now.
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Hugo, you want to, you want to lead us off on what we're discussing?
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, I can if you want.
**Bryan.wagar**: Hello, everybody.
**Bryan.wagar**: I just had a look at your sprinkler layout.
**Bryan.wagar**: Thank you.
**Bryan.wagar**: For us today, it's very good.
**Bryan.wagar**: I just noticed some maybe misunderstanding of some of our requirements.
**Bryan.wagar**: It's not a big deal, but we'll have to fix this before we start the installation of the project.
**Bryan.wagar**: I will show you what I found.
**Bryan.wagar**: Can you see my screen?
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Bryan.wagar**: Thank you.
**Bryan.wagar**: So this document is a Rackv2 sprinkler.
**Bryan.wagar**: It's how we can integrate the sprinkler system inside our vacuum.
**Bryan.wagar**: You know, like this.
**Bryan.wagar**: The elevation view.
**Bryan.wagar**: You receive the exact 2 elevation view we have in both systems, system 1 and system 2.
**Bryan.wagar**: And when we go to the requirement number 8, this one, I found that your sprinkler head are not at a good position compared to our turn buckets.
**Bryan.wagar**: As said by the requirement number eight, we need to have an offset of 90 millimeters between the opposite side of the rear bracing turnbuckles and your sprinkler head.
**Bryan.wagar**: Why?
**Bryan.wagar**: It's because if I zoom in here, you have like here, the turnbuckle.
**Bryan.wagar**: And so if you have a sprinkler head next to the turnbuckle, we cannot install the rack because we don't have enough space to put a hand between the turnbuckle and your sprinkler head.
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay, can you saw this in the layout?
**Bryan.wagar**: I will show you on my second screen.
**Bryan.wagar**: This.
**Bryan.wagar**: It's a very quick purpose.
**Bryan.wagar**: Sorry for the presentation.
**Bryan.wagar**: It's just an explanation.
**Bryan.wagar**: Here it's a bracing like this.
**Bryan.wagar**: And in red you have the 10 beacon.
**Bryan.wagar**: It's not the exact dimension here, but as you can see, you have your sprinkler head that is on the side of the thumbnail.
**Bryan.wagar**: If I take the middle of the upright, which is here, I'm aligning the middle of the upright, which is in yellow.
**Bryan.wagar**: You have enough sets on the right instead of having enough sets on the.
**Hugo.mascret**: Left.
**Bryan.wagar**: Here for the three heads in the middle.
**Bryan.wagar**: We don't care in the middle of the bracing because we don't have to.
**Bryan.wagar**: But on the last frame here, it's the same.
**Bryan.wagar**: We have the turnbuckle in red here.
**Bryan.wagar**: This is the middle of the right.
**Bryan.wagar**: And your sprinkler head should be here.
**Bryan.wagar**: Do you understand what I'm trying to say?
**Zane.garrison**: Yes, I understand.
**Zane.garrison**: You're saying that the sprinkler heads are on the wrong side of the upright of the steel because there's a bracing that will interfere with those sprinklers.
**Zane.garrison**: So you just need those mirrored onto the other side of that piece of steel.
**Bryan.wagar**: If I don't mistaken, it will not change the number of sprinkler head you have in just the position that have to be offset.
**Zane.garrison**: Correct.
**Zane.garrison**: It's just going to slightly adjust the position throughout the rack.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Hugo, from.
**Joseph.burdzy**: From your backgrounds and excuse me, from.
**Joseph.burdzy**: From what we're seeing on our end, is there an easy way for us to identify where those turnbuckles are?
**Zane.garrison**: Yeah, I mean, I see it.
**Zane.garrison**: It's where there's horizontal.
**Zane.garrison**: It's where there's diagonal.
**Zane.garrison**: Pieces of steel are.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Yeah, but it's.
**Joseph.burdzy**: It's not every diagonal piece.
**Joseph.burdzy**: So I just want to make sure we're.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Properly accounting for.
**Bryan.wagar**: Let me open the layout here.
**Bryan.wagar**: Which layout did you receive?
**Bryan.wagar**: Did you receive this one or the Skypod layout?
**Bryan.wagar**: This is your layout.
**Bryan.wagar**: I'm not very aware with AutoCAD, but as you can see, when you have the W shape like this, you're still showing your PowerPoint.
**Bryan.wagar**: Thank you.
**Bryan.wagar**: Here it is.
**Joseph.burdzy**: We can see that now.
**Bryan.wagar**: Thank you.
**Bryan.wagar**: When you have the W shape here, that means we have bracing.
**Bryan.wagar**: And at the beginning and at the end of the bracing, there is where we have the tumble curl.
**Bryan.wagar**: And they face inside the middle of the bracing.
**Bryan.wagar**: So this is the upright.
**Bryan.wagar**: And the tumble curve is on the right.
**Bryan.wagar**: On this one is on the left.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Okay.
**Joseph.burdzy**: So in the one you're showing now, the sprinkler head at the left of the turn of the W ratio, this one is good.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Is good.
**Joseph.burdzy**: But the one on the right needs to adjust.
**Hugo.mascret**: Yeah.
**Bryan.wagar**: And we need an offset of 90 millimeters.
**Bryan.wagar**: It's around three inches.
**Bryan.wagar**: So I'm French, so I'm not very used to use inches and fits.
**Zane.garrison**: But yes, well, the offset should be correct because I did use that offset from the documents.
**Zane.garrison**: I just didn't understand that there was.
**Zane.garrison**: There were bracing.
**Zane.garrison**: There's bracing throughout the rack.
**Zane.garrison**: So that's easy enough to change.
**Hugo.mascret**: Yeah.
**Bryan.wagar**: And for the sprinkler head, you have inside the rack, like this pipe here, here, and like here, they have to be in the middle of the upright.
**Bryan.wagar**: I will show you why.
**Bryan.wagar**: Let me come back to the document here.
**Bryan.wagar**: As you can see, your pipe will be support by the horizontal frame bracing support like this.
**Bryan.wagar**: This is the part we have in the rack in the middle of the frame.
**Bryan.wagar**: It's this part.
**Bryan.wagar**: You have lot of holes, and there is bigger holes for your U bolts and your pipes.
**Bryan.wagar**: So you will have one pipe here and the second pipe will be here.
**Bryan.wagar**: When you have two pipes, when you only have one pipe, it will be here.
**Bryan.wagar**: Correct?
**Zane.garrison**: Right.
**Bryan.wagar**: And for the position of your sprinkler head regarding the frame, let me just find this requirement where it is.
**Bryan.wagar**: This one like here?
**Hugo.mascret**: Yeah.
**Bryan.wagar**: You will see that this 60 millimeters here at the whites of the prides.
**Bryan.wagar**: And you have a part provided by Exotech, we call the sprinkler head protection that will go between the two brackets here.
**Bryan.wagar**: This part is like this, and it goes between the two brackets.
**Bryan.wagar**: And this is the upright.
**Bryan.wagar**: So your sprinkler head have to be aligned with the upright.
**Bryan.wagar**: Because here we have the bins.
**Bryan.wagar**: And so if the fork of the.
**Hugo.mascret**: Robot goes here and you have your.
**Bryan.wagar**: Sprinkler head offset of the upright, it will hit the sprinkler head.
**Bryan.wagar**: That's why we provide you a specific sprinkler head protection to be put over your sprinkler head.
**Bryan.wagar**: And you have to align the sprinkler head with the upright.
**Zane.garrison**: I'm sorry, I'm a little confused because that directly conflicts with another one of the requirements where it specifically says we're supposed to have an offset.
**Bryan.wagar**: This is for the Let me come back to the layout here.
**Bryan.wagar**: I'm talking about the pipes that are within the frame of the rack.
**Bryan.wagar**: This is a frame.
**Bryan.wagar**: So you have this, your pipe, like here when you have two pipes.
**Bryan.wagar**: And here you have only one pipe and the sandwich pipe.
**Bryan.wagar**: But the sandwich pipe has an offset and a specific rule.
**Bryan.wagar**: For those three pipes like this, you need to be aligned with the frames with the tolerances of plus minus 20 millimeters.
**Bryan.wagar**: Because you have a part.
**Bryan.wagar**: Let me open maybe the CAD I have of the rack.
**Bryan.wagar**: It would be easier to understand for you.
**Zane.garrison**: No, I mean, I understand what you're requesting.
**Bryan.wagar**: Like this is a price the.
**Bryan.wagar**: And you.
**Bryan.wagar**: Oops, sorry.
**Bryan.wagar**: You have like here the position for your sprinkler head.
**Bryan.wagar**: And the part will be.
**Bryan.wagar**: I have bad vision, but here will be better.
**Bryan.wagar**: Imagine you have the sprinkler right here.
**Bryan.wagar**: And we have your infrared protection that would be attached here.
**Bryan.wagar**: I see.
**Bryan.wagar**: It's a bit confusing with my explanation.
**Zane.garrison**: I'm a little confused because you're saying that we need to line up center with the vertical steel piece.
**Zane.garrison**: But the water shield is to the left or to the right of the vertical steel, which is where we have the heads positioned, is either to the left or the right of the vertical steel.
**Zane.garrison**: So I. I thought the heads were in the right spot to be covered by the water shields that you.
**Zane.garrison**: That Exotect is installing.
**Zane.garrison**: So that's what I'm a little confused of.
**Bryan.wagar**: No Exotech is providing the watershed for inside the rack for the sandwich pipe is your water shield like here.
**Bryan.wagar**: The sandwich pipe is attached here.
**Bryan.wagar**: And this is your water shield inside the rack here we provide water shield that is attached on this part.
**Bryan.wagar**: This is a bin bracket where we have our bin.
**Bryan.wagar**: We have two holes here to attach the sprinkler head protection for those.
**Hugo.mascret**: For this pipe here align like this.
**Bryan.wagar**: But inside the rack, inside the frame, you have to be aligned with the upright.
**Hugo.mascret**: This is the upright, like here and here.
**Bryan.wagar**: If I come back to the document like this, those are the bin brackets.
**Bryan.wagar**: Here is the modulation of the bin here.
**Bryan.wagar**: And your sprinkler head is aligned with the plate.
**Bryan.wagar**: And in blue, it's a sprinkler head protection provided by exotek.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Does that make sense now, Luther?
**Zane.garrison**: I think so.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Did we just confuse the bin bracket with the fire sprinkler coverage?
**Zane.garrison**: I think part of the problem is that we have an older document.
**Zane.garrison**: I don't think we have this.
**Bryan.wagar**: This is Revision two.
**Zane.garrison**: Yeah.
**Zane.garrison**: Well, the one that we have says it's revision 5, but it's not version 2.
**Zane.garrison**: We have the original revision 5, but we don't have the version 2 requirements.
**Zane.garrison**: So I think that might be part of the disconnect is that we were given an old.
**Bryan.wagar**: This one was in the revision one of the documents.
**Bryan.wagar**: So this document has been shared to you, if I don't mistaken, I was not part of the conversation at the beginning of the project.
**Zane.garrison**: I'm just looking at the one that we have and that we designed off of.
**Zane.garrison**: And we have NRAC sprinkler system specifications rev 5.
**Zane.garrison**: We don't have the version 2 revision 1.
**Bryan.wagar**: Can you show me the documents you have, please?
**Hugo.mascret**: Mm, yeah.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Can you.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Can you put it in the chat?
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Maybe.
**Zane.garrison**: This is the document that we have.
**Hugo.mascret**: Yeah.
**Zane.garrison**: Which I'm assuming is an older version.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, it's an on all.
**Bryan.wagar**: It's an old version of the document.
**Bryan.wagar**: But if we have a look it.
**Bryan.wagar**: I think the requirements are the same.
**Bryan.wagar**: Can we check it?
**Zane.garrison**: Sure.
**Zane.garrison**: Do you know what.
**Zane.garrison**: Which requirement number we're looking for?
**Bryan.wagar**: I don't really where it is in the document.
**Bryan.wagar**: Like here.
**Hugo.mascret**: Yeah.
**Bryan.wagar**: This one.
**Hugo.mascret**: Yeah.
**Bryan.wagar**: As you can see, the sprinkler head is aligned with the upright.
**Bryan.wagar**: It's not the good revision of the document.
**Bryan.wagar**: I agree, but the requirement is the same.
**Bryan.wagar**: The head is aligned with the pipe.
**Bryan.wagar**: Sorry.
**Bryan.wagar**: The head is aligned with the plate.
**Bryan.wagar**: Maybe it's a bit confusing and with a new document, it's more easy to understand.
**Shawn.mcknight**: All right, Hugo, let me share a picture right quick and give them a visual of it.
**Shawn.mcknight**: So right here, guys.
**Shawn.mcknight**: Here, go to the doctor.
**Shawn.mcknight**: Here go does the head.
**Shawn.mcknight**: He's talking about that.
**Shawn.mcknight**: You got to cover here.
**Shawn.mcknight**: If you can see my screen.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, we see it.
**Shawn.mcknight**: Okay.
**Shawn.mcknight**: And this, this part right here is in between the upright where he's talking about.
**Shawn.mcknight**: So if you look at this last picture here, you have this one here where the red cover is out of place.
**Shawn.mcknight**: It needs to shift over by to the way the green X is, is what Hugo is talking about.
**Shawn.mcknight**: So if I'm standing here, if you look at this front side of the up rack, this sprinkler is in the wrong place.
**Shawn.mcknight**: It needs to shift over to the light the left if you're looking at the screen.
**Shawn.mcknight**: So you do have a tolerance there.
**Shawn.mcknight**: But it has to sit right in between here where you see the diagonal, the sprinkler.
**Shawn.mcknight**: This head should sit right over here where you see this diagonal.
**Zane.garrison**: Right.
**Zane.garrison**: So I think I understand now what you're saying is that in the twin racks in the center line, it's supposed to have a left or right Offset.
**Zane.garrison**: But the lines, the other two lines are supposed to be centered on the upright.
**Shawn.mcknight**: Yes.
**Shawn.mcknight**: Now you do have a little tolerance.
**Shawn.mcknight**: So I know when we get there and see it, some of them might not sit directly there based on the pipe.
**Shawn.mcknight**: So you got a tolerance that's in between here, but for the most part that's where it needs to sit.
**Shawn.mcknight**: This here, if you look at this picture, is completely wrong.
**Shawn.mcknight**: Reason why I wanted to show it needs to shift over to the left, which it'll sit right up under here.
**Shawn.mcknight**: And this piece here, I'll be there on site.
**Shawn.mcknight**: And telly, it just clips in and fold down in.
**Shawn.mcknight**: Really not hard to put in.
**Shawn.mcknight**: You just, you clip the, the wings in and it just pops down, if that makes sense.
**Zane.garrison**: Yeah.
**Shawn.mcknight**: And like this here, like we'll be on site.
**Shawn.mcknight**: So I'll make sure, you know, it ain't.
**Shawn.mcknight**: It ain't a real hard, you know, adjustment, to be honest.
**Bryan.wagar**: It's very easy to use.
**Bryan.wagar**: It's easier than the standard sprinkler head protection.
**Shawn.mcknight**: Yes, yes, yes.
**Bryan.wagar**: Can I show you the other part provided by Exodeck?
**Bryan.wagar**: If we are all agree with the requirement and the discussion we had.
**Bryan.wagar**: Let's continue.
**Bryan.wagar**: So this is the parts Sean just showed us is a sprinkler head protection for inside the rack to attach your pipe, your.
**Bryan.wagar**: Sorry, your sandwich pipe.
**Bryan.wagar**: You have this part provided by Exotek, the horizontal sprinkler support that you will attach on the upright.
**Bryan.wagar**: If I come back to the document, it's not this one.
**Hugo.mascret**: It'S like this.
**Bryan.wagar**: This part provided by exotech, not the bolting we.
**Bryan.wagar**: Not the thread here, only the part you attach it on the upright.
**Bryan.wagar**: And for your vertical pipes at the beginning and potentially at the end of a block, you also have a vertical sprinkler support right here that you can attach on the rack on the upright.
**Bryan.wagar**: And last part is because this horizontal frame bracing is thicker than your sprinkler pipes, if you tight it too much, it will bend the part.
**Bryan.wagar**: That's why we have the U bolt reinforcement plate.
**Bryan.wagar**: It's just a piece of metal that you put under your Ubert to avoiding a bending of the horizontal frame bracing.
**Bryan.wagar**: So those parts are provided by Exotech and you will have to install them.
**Bryan.wagar**: I will send you, I will send you this document so you can go through it.
**Jdawson**: So what, what part of the racks do we install it with?
**Jdawson**: The rod and loop hanger, as opposed to the U bolts.
**Bryan.wagar**: Sorry, can you repeat, please?
**Jdawson**: We.
**Jdawson**: You just showed two different details.
**Jdawson**: One had a rod, a threaded Rod and a regular loop hanger.
**Jdawson**: And then.
**Jdawson**: And then you just showed the other detail that had the U bolt with the stiffener in it.
**Jdawson**: What's.
**Jdawson**: Where's.
**Bryan.wagar**: This one?
**Bryan.wagar**: The horizontal sprinkler support.
**Bryan.wagar**: This is for your sandwich pipe.
**Bryan.wagar**: Can you mute yourself, please?
**Bryan.wagar**: Thank you.
**Bryan.wagar**: This horizontal sprinkler support is for your sandwich pipe.
**Bryan.wagar**: And you will have to attach it on the upright.
**Bryan.wagar**: On the back upright.
**Bryan.wagar**: We provide this part.
**Bryan.wagar**: And I will also send you the rag v2 sprinkler bomb.
**Bryan.wagar**: So we'll have what is provided by exotech and what has to be provided by the sprinkler company.
**Bryan.wagar**: And for your vertical pipes, we have.
**Bryan.wagar**: The vertical sprinkler support is to fix the vertical water column and to enter on the lateral side of the rack.
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay.
**Bryan.wagar**: And it's the same.
**Bryan.wagar**: It's just attached on the pipes.
**Bryan.wagar**: And after you can put your pipe and go up.
**Shawn.mcknight**: Do you understand what he means by sandwich pipe?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Like the flu space, basically, right?
**Hugo.mascret**: Yeah, yeah.
**Shawn.mcknight**: Make sure we have this right here.
**Shawn.mcknight**: Right here is the sandwich pipe in the.
**Shawn.mcknight**: In the middle.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Shawn.mcknight**: And then you have the filler pipes, which are these two.
**Hugo.mascret**: Right, right.
**Bryan.wagar**: And the small part, the last I showed you, the hubolt reinforcement plate.
**Bryan.wagar**: It's for inside the frame.
**Hugo.mascret**: Okay.
**Hugo.mascret**: Yes, I got it here for you.
**Bryan.wagar**: Just check that.
**Bryan.wagar**: I will send you this document so you can double check with your layout.
**Bryan.wagar**: Make the modification.
**Bryan.wagar**: If you want, you can send it to us so we can check also.
**Bryan.wagar**: Double check is always better than only one, and I think we are in a good way.
**Joseph.burdzy**: So, Hugo, just to confirm from Henderson's end, the updates needed from our end are to adjust the head spacing in the sandwich pipe to the correct 90 millimeter offset for the turnbuckles and then adjust the head spacing for the.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Sorry, I can't remember what you call them.
**Joseph.burdzy**: The in racks or the filler.
**Joseph.burdzy**: The filler pipes so that those heads align with the uprights.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, it's what I found when I.
**Bryan.wagar**: When I had a look at your sprinkler layout.
**Bryan.wagar**: I didn't check every of your sprinkler head.
**Bryan.wagar**: I think with this document, you will have all the details you need to double check and review your layout.
**Bryan.wagar**: But yes, this is for the sandwich pipe.
**Bryan.wagar**: Requirement number eight is for the sandwich pipe.
**Bryan.wagar**: And requirement number six, it's for your filler pipes.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Okay, Luther, does that all make sense to you from our end?
**Zane.garrison**: I understand.
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Good question for Aliato.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Jesse, is this going to impact the fabrication at all or are we still at a time where this won't.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Where we're still ahead of that.
**Cody.page**: That.
**Cody.page**: Sorry, I was driving during most of this, but, Chris, does that change anything in your mind on your sprinkler shops?
**Luther.pringle**: Yeah, absolutely.
**Luther.pringle**: Absolutely it does.
**Luther.pringle**: So I don't know if we've got pipe on site already, but we're gonna have to make some changes.
**Cody.page**: How quick can you make those changes in the keba?
**Cody.page**: When were they going to start fabbing this pipe?
**Jesse**: So Michael said they're able to do the fabrication two days before they deliver.
**Jesse**: He said they like to wait until they're about to deliver so they can fabricate and send them to the field.
**Jesse**: So we have them doing it in two weeks.
**Jesse**: So if we can get the revisions next week, that we should still be good.
**Cody.page**: How long will that take?
**Hugo.mascret**: Not a problem.
**Luther.pringle**: Jesse and Kid, I can.
**Luther.pringle**: I'll work on it over the weekend and verify before we submit new fabrication.
**Luther.pringle**: But I'm trying.
**Luther.pringle**: I'm tracking what's going on.
**Luther.pringle**: I see what the solution is here or what the conflicts were, so.
**Cody.page**: Okay.
**Cody.page**: And Jesse, is this going to affect your install at all or just as long as you caught it now we're good.
**Jdawson**: No, that shouldn't bother us, you know.
**Cody.page**: Okay, well, it's not often you catch it before you get it fabbed and delivered to the site and you're putting it up, so it's good.
**Cody.page**: I appreciate you guys putting this together.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: No, I want to thank everybody for jumping on as far as the install goes.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Well, first of all, as far as design.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Do we have any other questions?
**Joseph.burdzy**: Just one more for my end.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Chris, do you.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Are you gonna need updated design drawings from Henderson before you can adjust the.
**Joseph.burdzy**: The shop drawings, or do you want to work simultaneously on this item?
**Joseph.burdzy**: Can you work simultaneously on this item?
**Joseph.burdzy**: I guess.
**Luther.pringle**: Let me ask you, Henderson, what.
**Luther.pringle**: What would your turnaround look like?
**Luther.pringle**: I'd like to have them just so we're.
**Luther.pringle**: We're on the same page, but I mean, if we.
**Luther.pringle**: We could work in parallel, I think, you know, as long as we're tracking the same.
**Luther.pringle**: Same idea of what's happening.
**Bryan.wagar**: Right?
**Luther.pringle**: Yeah, but if, you know, I don't know how long it would take you guys to make those revisions.
**Luther.pringle**: I mean, it's not going to take me a whole lot of time to update Fabless, so, I mean, if.
**Luther.pringle**: If you can get me updated drawings, I don't know, by Monday or Tuesday.
**Luther.pringle**: That still shouldn't impact getting Fabrication updated by the middle of next week.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Luther, what's your time frame on these updates?
**Zane.garrison**: I mean, it.
**Zane.garrison**: Take me at least a day to do them.
**Zane.garrison**: But I also have some other pressing deadlines that I'm in the process of working through.
**Zane.garrison**: So hard to say.
**Zane.garrison**: I mean, I guess if I work for the weekend, I could have it done for Monday.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Do we have a.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Do we have a drop dead date where we're not going to impact fabrication keba or.
**Jesse**: I mean, it would be great if we can have it, let's say, by Thursday.
**Jesse**: So that way they have it by Friday and they can work on it the following week.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Chris, does that work if we get you updated drawings on Thursday?
**Luther.pringle**: Yeah, yeah, I can update fab drawings, you know, in a.
**Luther.pringle**: In a couple hours.
**Luther.pringle**: So if you guys get me something by Thursday, I can spend that day and have everything ready by Friday morning.
**Luther.pringle**: Yeah, I think that that would be probably the best way to do it.
**Luther.pringle**: So we're all on the same page, to be honest.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Okay.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Luther, does Thursday work better for you?
**Zane.garrison**: Yeah, I mean, I'll do my best.
**Zane.garrison**: Okay, well, I said to do my best.
**Zane.garrison**: I'll make it happen.
**Zane.garrison**: It's not ideal, but I can make it happen.
**Joseph.burdzy**: All right, so we'll shoot for end of day Thursday to get updated drawings out.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Whether it's in a bulletin or if we need to submit an rfi.
**Joseph.burdzy**: We can discuss that on Wednesday, but we'll get started on updating those drawings when we can.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Yeah, if we can shoot the entire group, too, just so Hugo can take a second look over it real quick.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Yeah, yeah, we'll include the tech group in that.
**Cody.page**: So these drawings that.
**Cody.page**: And what's been reviewed, is that going to get shared so that we all have that info?
**Luther.pringle**: Hey, Luther, if it makes it easier as well, if you wanted to just update, like update the single rack and then a double rack and just give me one section of each and then, you know, because they're typical.
**Luther.pringle**: Right.
**Luther.pringle**: I can write as well.
**Luther.pringle**: I mean, that.
**Luther.pringle**: That can help.
**Zane.garrison**: I mean, I mean that I could knock out pretty quick.
**Zane.garrison**: I could have that for you first thing Monday morning.
**Zane.garrison**: I mean, that's what.
**Zane.garrison**: That would only take me.
**Zane.garrison**: That probably takes less than an hour to do just one of each, if we're good with that.
**Zane.garrison**: Rather than updating like an issuing completely updated drawings.
**Zane.garrison**: I mean, I can knock that out really quick for you.
**Luther.pringle**: Yeah, absolutely.
**Luther.pringle**: Just give me something I can work off just for the.
**Luther.pringle**: For the fabrication.
**Zane.garrison**: Right.
**Luther.pringle**: Since they're all the same.
**Luther.pringle**: I don't need a full set.
**Luther.pringle**: We know what the rack, you know, we know what each rack is.
**Zane.garrison**: Right, right.
**Zane.garrison**: Well, I know if we later want to update a full set.
**Zane.garrison**: I mean, we can.
**Zane.garrison**: We can still do that, I guess.
**Joseph.burdzy**: We.
**Zane.garrison**: Henderson, we just need to know some.
**Luther.pringle**: AS builds down the road or something like that.
**Zane.garrison**: Yeah.
**Joseph.burdzy**: So, yeah, if we want to go that route.
**Joseph.burdzy**: Kevin, can you get an RFI submitted for this?
**Joseph.burdzy**: And we'll.
**Joseph.burdzy**: We'll knock that out and then just issue an RFI response with the updated space, typical updated spacing on each racking type so that the.
**Joseph.burdzy**: So that Chris and his team can get the fabs updated.
**Jesse**: Okay.
**Joseph.burdzy**: And Joe and Hugo, we can.
**Joseph.burdzy**: We can send out a preliminary updated layout to you guys before we respond to that rfi just so you guys can take a look and make sure that we're in alignment with what was talked about today.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, of course.
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay.
**Jesse**: And Sean, if you were able to, can you share some of those pictures you were showing earlier?
**Shawn.mcknight**: Yes, sir, I sure can.
**Jesse**: Okay, thank you.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Okay, that wraps up design as far as installation.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: I just wanted to see if anybody had any questions for installation on when and how long does sprinkler have to wait before there's enough area that they can start pushing their pipe through.
**Bryan.wagar**: I can maybe show you something so it can be easier to understand the coordination and why it's very important to work together in the rack.
**Bryan.wagar**: Find this document.
**Bryan.wagar**: It's not released, but I can just show you the global picture of how we will work together.
**Hugo.mascret**: Screens this one.
**Bryan.wagar**: So can you see it?
**Jesse**: Yes.
**Bryan.wagar**: It sounds like this is global explanation.
**Bryan.wagar**: You already knew it because you are a Sprintler company.
**Bryan.wagar**: So the synchronization when we will assemble the first side is what we call side A.
**Bryan.wagar**: If we have a wall, it's not the case for this project.
**Bryan.wagar**: But you put your horizontal pipe, your filler pipe, after we work on the side B like this, we assemble the side B.
**Bryan.wagar**: And after, when we have finished the side B, you can put your sandwich pipe.
**Bryan.wagar**: And then after you have put your sandwich pipe, we can continue and put the back to back with the second side A.
**Bryan.wagar**: And this coordination will be very important because if you don't have put your sandwich pipe before we came back at this position of the rack, we cannot continue.
**Bryan.wagar**: It will be a nice on site coordination.
**Bryan.wagar**: It works well often on site.
**Bryan.wagar**: I hope it will be good also with you.
**Bryan.wagar**: But we have to work in the same time and if you work in the same days and same working hours, it will be fine.
**Bryan.wagar**: Do you have any question about that?
**Christopher.w.lopez**: And the team is going to be working Monday through Saturday, correct?
**Hugo.mascret**: Yeah.
**Hugo.mascret**: Yeah.
**Hugo.mascret**: Okay.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Are we all aligned there, Kiva?
**Jesse**: I think we've been working Monday through.
**Bryan.wagar**: Friday.
**Jesse**: And I think that's.
**Jesse**: That was Jesse's plan to correct me if I'm wrong.
**Jesse**: Jesse.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Normally unless you know, there's.
**Jdawson**: There was a need to work weekends, we would not.
**Jdawson**: Is there.
**Jdawson**: Will we have the opportunity to have some on site meetings when the racking starts getting installed to just look at.
**Bryan.wagar**: This and yeah, yeah, we can do coordination meeting.
**Bryan.wagar**: It would be without me.
**Bryan.wagar**: It would be with Dadano, which is also you have the same skill as me and yeah, it would be important at the beginning you come and you have a look at what we are doing.
**Bryan.wagar**: If you know and understand our activity, it should be easier to work together.
**Jdawson**: Absolutely.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: My concern is if we can't work on Saturdays, if we don't have sprinkler people out there.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yes, we plan to work on Saturday.
**Shawn.mcknight**: Sometime.
**Shawn.mcknight**: Joseph, before the wrecking company will work on Saturdays to get ahead.
**Shawn.mcknight**: So the sprinkler company can have work when they come in.
**Shawn.mcknight**: So is.
**Shawn.mcknight**: Is, is possible that sometime the standing crew will stand without the sprinkler company.
**Shawn.mcknight**: That makes sense.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Okay.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: We got to make sure that we don't get too far ahead.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: That they can't.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: That we cut them off.
**Shawn.mcknight**: No, they won't.
**Shawn.mcknight**: They.
**Shawn.mcknight**: They usually stand and give a good run for the sprinkler company to be able to come behind them.
**Shawn.mcknight**: Because like Hugo was saying, they can't go to the next block until the sandwich pipe and stuff is in.
**Hugo.mascret**: Yeah.
**Bryan.wagar**: Let me check with the layout.
**Bryan.wagar**: What is the length of the block?
**Bryan.wagar**: Because if you have big blocks, we will not install like 50 or 60 frame a day.
**Bryan.wagar**: So we're not install a full block in a day.
**Bryan.wagar**: So maybe it's not a big deal if the sprinkler company is not working on Saturday.
**Bryan.wagar**: Let me check.
**Cody.page**: We'll coordinate that with Jesse and his team.
**Cody.page**: And like if the schedule dictates it and we need to get some guys out there, I'm sure we can accommodate.
**Cody.page**: It's just they didn't plan on working six days a week from day one till the end.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Yeah.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: And, and I, and I just want to make sure that if you do go out there, you have something to do and you're not, you know, everybody's not just out there sitting on their hands.
**Bryan.wagar**: That's all.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, yeah, Joseph, I, I checked and we have our block are like 69 chimneys long and we plan to install 30 to.
**Bryan.wagar**: To 25 frames per day.
**Bryan.wagar**: We plan 25 on the Saturday.
**Bryan.wagar**: So it will not be an issue if the swim draw company is not working on Saturday.
**Bryan.wagar**: If the job is done on Friday, it will be fine.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Perfect.
**Bryan.wagar**: This rack is most difficult to install that the previous rack we already installed together.
**Bryan.wagar**: So we will go a bit slower compared to what we already did.
**Hugo.mascret**: After that.
**Jesse**: Hugo, if you get a chance, please send those documents you were sharing earlier.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, yeah, I will send you those documents and also the sprinkler bomb.
**Bryan.wagar**: The rag V2 sprinkler bomb.
**Bryan.wagar**: So you will have the all the parts exotech provide you and all the parts are required for the assembly with the exotic part.
**Jesse**: Okay, sounds good.
**Jesse**: All right.
**Jesse**: Joe, do you have anything else?
**Christopher.w.lopez**: No, that's all I have.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: I just wanted to get everybody to have, you know, one initial call, you know, two go over the design and make sure we catch anything that we can, which it's obvious that we did.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: So thank you for setting this up, Kiva.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: And then, as said, I'm sure there's.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: There's definitely going to be meetings on site to.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: To coordinate.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: So we'll.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: We'll.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: We'll have more meetings coming up shortly.
**Jesse**: Right?
**Jesse**: Sounds good.
**Jesse**: Thank you everyone for jumping on.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Perfect, guys.
**Christopher.w.lopez**: Thank you.
**Shawn.mcknight**: Thank you, guys.
**Shawn.mcknight**: Have a good weekend.
**Jesse**: Thank.
**Shawn.mcknight**: Sam.
