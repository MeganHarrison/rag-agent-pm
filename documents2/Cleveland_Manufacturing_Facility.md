# Project Planning Meeting

**MEETING ID:** 01K45QEV1Q6H0HS1PM7V1XR5P5  
**HOST:** bclymer@alleatogroup.com  
**ATTENDEES:** tony@ibexdevgroup.com, djkeehan@djkonline.com, bclymer@alleatogroup.com

> The meeting aimed to discuss funding updates and the development of a new manufacturing facility in Cleveland.

## Summary

Team members expressed frustration over delays in funding approval, which jeopardizes project timelines. Philip Johnson detailed the fund structure involving variable rate demand obligations (VRDOs) with a 2% interest spread, mainly benefiting commercial real estate. Guardian proposed a 35,000 square foot manufacturing facility that will require an additional 10,000 square feet for Arc Edge. The manufacturing process will utilize two production lines for foam cutting and steel processing, outlined by specifications for panel sizes. Brandon Clymer's design proposes a demised space to enhance collaboration between Guardian and Arc Edge. The Cleveland site features suitable infrastructure, confirmed access, and geotechnical reports supporting construction. A monolithic slab construction approach will allow for winter work, with key milestones including lease negotiations around mid-October and projected approvals by late November to early December 2024, aiming for a construction kickoff in March 2025.

## Key Discussion Points

- Geotech reports available for entire site showing "compactable clay" soil conditions suitable for pier foundations.

### üèóÔ∏è Construction Approach (01:03:49 - 01:05:23)
- Monolithic slab with frost-free footer (16" deep, 3' out, 2' wide) plus 42-inch piers for structural support.
- Winter construction possible with pier system allowing slab pour in spring after ground thaws.
- Guardian panels for both walls and roof; traditional structural steel with 8-foot joist spacing for cost efficiency.

### ‚è≥ Project Timeline (01:07:28 - 01:17:42)
- City meeting scheduled: Week of October 15th (16th or 17th) for lease negotiation based on job creation commitments.
- Projected approval: Late November/early December 2024 accounting for city council approval process.
- Design phase: November-December start, 2-month permit timeline, March 2025 construction start optimal for weather conditions.

### üñäÔ∏è Design Responsibility Discussion (01:13:51 - 01:16:36)
- Guardian handles civil, structural, architectural design in-house; MEP design to be farmed out.
- Brandon's team recommended for design-build MEP coordination due to manufacturing facility expertise.
- Potential for increased Alleato Group involvement in overall design if Guardian lacks bandwidth.

### üåü DC Innovation Showcase Preparation (01:07:17 - 01:21:46)
- DJ traveling to DC Friday for 5-day Innovative Housing Showcase.
- Guardian bringing mock roof with two Arc Edge solar panels mounted on Guardian roof system demonstrating 2-inch airspace requirement.
