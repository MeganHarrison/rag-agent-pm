## Transcript
**Kevin.ly**: Hi, Team.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Amit.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Excuse me.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: I am laid up on the couch with my leg elevated.
**Daisuke.mine**: Healing.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: How are you?
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: How's that new baby?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I'm.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I am trying to unfreeze my screen.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: How is your leg feeling?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Is my first question that I asked while I was trying to unmute.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Dude, I'll.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: I'll text you a picture of it.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Like, it's all purple.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: It's unreal.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So gross.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Baby's doing good though.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Finally in daycare.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So I have some time for myself before picking her up.
**Daisuke.mine**: That's awesome.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So I invited Mike.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Mike will be our on site guy for the project.
**Daisuke.mine**: He's doing the.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Doing a system right now in Burnville.
**Daisuke.mine**: So he'll.
**Daisuke.mine**: As soon as that finishes, he'll transfer right over.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: And then.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Yeah.
**Daisuke.mine**: So I think.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Let's see here.
**Daisuke.mine**: Kevin's on Isuk joining us or have.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: You talked to him?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah, Yusuke should be joining.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I see that there is the legal team from Uniqlo is on.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And Jesse.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: No, that's it.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Where is my phone?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Let's text it really quick.
**Aelkarrimy**: What's up?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yusuke is trying to join, guys.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: He's just having some virtual problems with the Internet.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So he's trying to get that sorted out.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And he's joining in a few seconds.
**Aelkarrimy**: Go.
**Daisuke.mine**: I don't think is.
**Daisuke.mine**: Joe's not on here.
**Daisuke.mine**: I don't think.
**Daisuke.mine**: Let me.
**John.min**: And let me just check and see where Elana is.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Do you want me to give him a quick call?
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: No, I.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: It's.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: It's our fault.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: It doesn't look like we.
**Daisuke.mine**: We attached him to the invite.
**Daisuke.mine**: So I'll forward it to him and.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Then I.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: I know Maria probably sent.
**Daisuke.mine**: Out the invite to all the.
**Daisuke.mine**: A legal team.
**Daisuke.mine**: That's by accident.
**Daisuke.mine**: I wasn't clear when I told her to invite Uniqlo that it just needs to be the construction people.
**Daisuke.mine**: So I apologize.
**Daisuke.mine**: But you guys don't need to be on here if you don't want to.
**Daisuke.mine**: You can jump off.
**Daisuke.mine**: So.
**John.min**: Hi.
**John.min**: I'm sorry.
**John.min**: Let me just step in really quick.
**John.min**: So Alana was not on that.
**John.min**: On that invite.
**John.min**: I was.
**John.min**: So just to confirm if you do.
**John.min**: You do not need legal.
**John.min**: Just to be honest.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: No, this is.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: This is just construction, so that's okay.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: I wasn't.
**John.min**: No, no, it's okay.
**John.min**: Okay, Perfect.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So while we have legal on the call, just before you hang up.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I'm so sorry about that.
**John.min**: I'm not an attorney.
**John.min**: Just so you know.
**John.min**: I'm not an attorney.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I got legal.
**John.min**: Then we need to have a line on the call if you need to discuss legal.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Oh, no, I think then we're fine.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I just wanted to make sure you understands that we need that loi somewhat signed just so then you guys are able to release trades.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So you, whenever you can get that document that Brandon issued to you, they can get the ball moving with shop drawings and whatnot.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: I sent it to you and Kevin.
**Stilianos.diakoumakis**: Yes, we received and I'm working with my legal to get a review to sign.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Okay.
**Daisuke.mine**: All right.
**Daisuke.mine**: Okay, perfect.
**John.min**: So I'm going to hop off then, everybody.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Thank you.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And Kevin, do you think that will be somewhat signed within the next few days?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Just because we do have.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: We are anticipating shop drawings on 5 5.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So by the time we just want to make sure that everything is awarded and like that letter is sorted out.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So then Brandon is able to release his team.
**Stilianos.diakoumakis**: Yes, our CFO who would be doing the signing is already okay.
**Stilianos.diakoumakis**: We're just waiting for legal to approve so he can sign.
**Stilianos.diakoumakis**: So he's aware that we need a loa sign.
**Stilianos.diakoumakis**: Loi.
**Stilianos.diakoumakis**: Sorry.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Sounds good.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Okay, well then yeah, we'll look for that so that we can get everybody on board and then.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Yeah, so we'll, we'll kind of just jump into the schedule.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So you got all your comments earlier mid.
**Daisuke.mine**: So which we can go ahead and address all these.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Okay, so, so okay, so going back to the, the permit.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So we've got, we've got all the, you know, the guys that we know that we're going to be using and.
**Daisuke.mine**: We'Ve got those, everything filled out.
**Daisuke.mine**: You know, that date that I put on there is basically two weeks from when we submitted, which is what, you know, everybody wanted to plug.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: The city's still not done reviewing it.
**Daisuke.mine**: You know, they say it's.
**Daisuke.mine**: They need four weeks, but ideally I guess they get done in two.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So as long as we have that.
**Daisuke.mine**: Loi, then we'll be able to pull everything from there.
**Daisuke.mine**: Ideally we'll have a contract and PO, but at least if we have an OI that keeps things moving.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Does that make sense?
**Kevin.ly**: 100%.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And I think just so everyone is aware, we can beat the four week timeline for review if all, all information is with the dob.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So when we called the DOB on Monday, they were just asking with regards to the subcontractors licenses and whatnot that will be completing that work.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So I know that that loi is very critical you, Suke and Kevin.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So if we can get that as soon as possible, that would be great.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So then this way Brandon can fulfill those applications with the dob and then from there I can call Eileen and the inspector and see if we can get things moving faster than that four week time.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: And they're.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: They're still reviewing concurrently.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: It's not there.
**Kevin.ly**: No, I know, but they told me.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: They can, they can turn it around within a week to 10 days if we have everything in hand.
**Kevin.ly**: So when I called her to see.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: If she has everything in hand, she brought up the subcontractor licenses and whatnot.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So that's why they're taking their time until all the applications are in and whatnot.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So the faster we move on this, the faster we can kind of position our conversation with the local jurisdiction.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: And that obviously ties right into, you know, our submittals, you know, getting that.
**Daisuke.mine**: You know, put in as well.
**Daisuke.mine**: Because we got to get those guys.
**Daisuke.mine**: Obviously they got to do them.
**Daisuke.mine**: You guys need time to review them.
**Daisuke.mine**: So everything's getting very, very tight schedule wise.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: And so this 4 survey.
**Daisuke.mine**: I think I don't know where your thing is.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Blue.
**Daisuke.mine**: Oh yeah, Scope for Skyfunder.
**Daisuke.mine**: Yeah.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So the fourth survey, you know, that's.
**Daisuke.mine**: That'S going to happen.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: That's literally just surveying it like so they're coming in, they've got these little.
**Daisuke.mine**: Devices that they measure the floor with so they know what they need to remediate.
**Daisuke.mine**: So no, the permit doesn't have to.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Be pulled for that.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: They can go in there and do that today.
**Daisuke.mine**: That, that doesn't require anything.
**Daisuke.mine**: That's just measuring.
**Daisuke.mine**: And in reality, honestly, you don't even need to pull a permit for the actual four remediation.
**Daisuke.mine**: Like the only time that you need to start like require a permit for stuff is when we start actually, you know, doing sprinkler and electrical and racking things like that.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: That and I'll keep rolling through this I guess, unless.
**Daisuke.mine**: Yasuki, do you have any questions or is that clear?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So Yasuke, I know that you and I had some concerns when we were looking at the permit issuance date of 5:2 versus the submittals being released on 5:9.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So if you kind of see what's going on here, once you have permit, they can get started right away with submittals.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So that's why there's a little bit of a gap between the two.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So that was one of our main concerns when we were looking at that versus where it shows issued subcontract.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So regardless, with the issued subcontracts, once the LOI is in place, he can at least start that.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Those conversations and getting the shop drawing requested from these Sub vendors.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So yeah.
**Kevin.ly**: So as soon as we have subcontracts.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Is connected to submittals.
**Daisuke.mine**: Right.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So we gotta correct, get this the Lois and subcontracts out and then, then.
**Daisuke.mine**: They'Ll give us the submittals.
**Kevin.ly**: Noted.
**Daisuke.mine**: So that's why you see the 5, 9 and 58 because these two are connected.
**Daisuke.mine**: It's not necessarily connected to the permit because we can get that in, you know, as soon as possible.
**Daisuke.mine**: It's just that that's the time.
**Daisuke.mine**: And then this, this is you know, submittal and review time.
**Daisuke.mine**: It's not like they would all be done on five, nine.
**Daisuke.mine**: This is your finish date.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And also Yusuke, per my discussions with Brandon, these dates that are in here are kind of a buffer.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: If things move up and down a little bit, it shouldn't really affect everyone.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: This just kind of gives everyone a game plan of what's coming down the pipeline and what's starting next.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So I think the first five items are somewhat clarified.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: But then moving down to item number 9 and 10 I believe in between the two there should be some sort of a marking of the racks layout on the slab denoted here.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So if you look at so racking install B is 8, 8, 4.
**Daisuke.mine**: Okay.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: And so they're going to do for remediation, relocate existing lights.
**Daisuke.mine**: Plan A.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So what we'll do is they'll do the forward mediation and then we'll go in and we will run our whips injunction boxes and put them in basically the as close of a location as we think they're going to land.
**Daisuke.mine**: Because we're going to have a six.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Foot whip on that light.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So then once they actually start the racking here, you can reposition them.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Correct.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Then we'll, we'll actually install the lights.
**Daisuke.mine**: Themselves because they can be put exactly where it is.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Like we know the rack's not going to shift 12ft.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Right.
**Daisuke.mine**: Like we talk about shifting, it's inches.
**Kevin.ly**: So Yusuke, for this item, do you, do you understand what's going on here or do you need me to clarify something?
**Kevin.ly**: Because it makes complete sense now.
**Kevin.ly**: The plan is to have a six foot slack on the lights.
**Kevin.ly**: This way they can still start the.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Scope of work as per the schedule.
**Kevin.ly**: Without the marking of the slab of the racks on the slab.
**Kevin.ly**: But once they start the racking system, they can then shift those lights accordingly because there's a six foot whip.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Ilana.rozentsvayg**: So you, they can adjust it if anything happened to the rack location.
**Kevin.ly**: Correct.
**Kevin.ly**: So then marking of the racks on the slab is not something that's going to Happen right away.
**Kevin.ly**: So then they have a game plan to just keep moving forward there.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: All right.
**Kevin.ly**: And then we kind of touched on item number 11, how number 11 and number 5 kind of go hand in hand.
**Kevin.ly**: So as soon as that LOI is issued, this, this should remain, I guess, in schedule.
**Kevin.ly**: And then when you say 10 days, Brandon, what do we mean by 10 days?
**Kevin.ly**: Are we saying all shop drawings will be submitted and we have like 10 days to return them or within 10.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Days we should receive all shop drawings for the project?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: What does that 10 day mark really mean?
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So, so this, so this 10 days is what I had for submission and review.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Now if, if we need longer, then, you know, that is what it is.
**Daisuke.mine**: I mean, in reality we just have to look and say, like, okay, like.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: What is the most, you know, time critical item?
**Daisuke.mine**: So if we look at, like, when we're talking about doing our feeders and new panels and stuff like that, that's all, you know.
**Daisuke.mine**: So we gotta have take time to.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Order, get it there, all that stuff.
**Daisuke.mine**: So that electrical is gonna be the driver.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Now it also depends on how in depth and everything.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: You know, we want to the.
**Daisuke.mine**: The submittals to be like, typically, you know, for something like this, it's like, all right, here's the panels we're using, here's the wire.
**Daisuke.mine**: It should be pretty simple, especially on the, on the electrical side.
**Daisuke.mine**: The sprinkler side is.
**Daisuke.mine**: I mean, I think that Henderson is still, still detailing their stuff.
**Daisuke.mine**: And we've got our fab drawings that really are getting into the detail.
**Daisuke.mine**: But as far as electrically and Jesse.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Are there even any shop drawings that.
**Daisuke.mine**: We'Re going to need electrically?
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Because we're not doing a one line.
**Daisuke.mine**: Or anything like that.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: It's all just product data.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah, It'll be all our panel schedules and gear submittals.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And like, if you guys are meeting what's on the drawings, then you're good to go.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: But if, if there's any alternates or deviations from the design, then we definitely need to, to be able to have.
**Kevin.ly**: That review, and engineers definitely would need to review that.
**Stilianos.diakoumakis**: Sorry to interrupt real quick.
**Stilianos.diakoumakis**: Trying to escalate on the LOI right now, since that's going to be one of the hot bucks.
**Stilianos.diakoumakis**: Yes.
**Stilianos.diakoumakis**: What's the hard deadline to get it over to you so I can give my team like a hard date in.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Order to hit the timeline that's on the schedule?
**Kevin.ly**: Brandon.
**Daisuke.mine**: Yes, Tomorrow.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: All right, got it.
**Stilianos.diakoumakis**: Thanks.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So, yeah, so again, it's all pretty much product data, so I don't think we're going to have again, shop drawings.
**Daisuke.mine**: Obviously takes time to draw and I.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Don'T think we really are going to.
**Daisuke.mine**: Have any of those.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: That we're going.
**Daisuke.mine**: To need electrically, which is going to be our first thing.
**Daisuke.mine**: So it should be okay.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: I mean, we plug a date in.
**Daisuke.mine**: There because we have to put something in.
**Daisuke.mine**: But again, I, I can't be certain.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Right.
**Daisuke.mine**: Like it's if it, you know, hey.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: It takes review longer or you know, something alternate doesn't get approved, we got.
**Daisuke.mine**: To go back to drawing board, whatever, I don't know.
**Daisuke.mine**: But that, that should be sufficient.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Ish.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: I mean, I can make, I make.
**Daisuke.mine**: It 20 days, but yeah, this is.
**Kevin.ly**: 10 days per shop drawing.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: No, no, that's the total process.
**Kevin.ly**: Oh, okay.
**Kevin.ly**: Okay.
**Daisuke.mine**: Yeah, yeah.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: I mean, we're gonna try to get them all in and done, you know, asap.
**Kevin.ly**: I think the moment you, you issue all the shop drawings one shot and you say, hey, all the shop drawings have been issued, we should get on a call with all the engineers and just kind of figure out what's the duration.
**Kevin.ly**: Just so then you understand also and have an idea of when things will be turned around.
**Kevin.ly**: I know architecturally speaking, things will be turned around fast, but engineering wise, that's going to need some time to review.
**Kevin.ly**: And I know Henderson usually needs like a good five to seven business days to just finish out shop drawings.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So I don't even, I don't even know architecturally what submittals.
**Kevin.ly**: We would have exit signs, light fixtures.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Oh, I figured we would send that to the electrician.
**Daisuke.mine**: You want that stuff?
**Kevin.ly**: Oh, still?
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah, we should still look at it.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Just so I can make sure that the specification matches my schedule.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And then the engineers would take over.
**Kevin.ly**: From there and just stamp for the.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Calculations and the loads.
**Daisuke.mine**: Okay, we'll just put it in the same flow then.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: But yeah.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Cool.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So note on item five.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So what's the question on these?
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Exactly.
**Kevin.ly**: So going down to 27.
**Kevin.ly**: So number one, we don't see any installation of convenience outlets at the skypath area within this schedule.
**Daisuke.mine**: Yeah, so drops to workstation, but that's.
**Kevin.ly**: Just to the workstations.
**Kevin.ly**: But what about the skypath area?
**Daisuke.mine**: So install feeders to the transformer location, soft feeders to workstations, set and make.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Final connections for step down.
**Kevin.ly**: Now.
**Kevin.ly**: I know, I know, I know.
**Kevin.ly**: Exotect.
**Kevin.ly**: Still finalizing their skypath area.
**Kevin.ly**: So then we can actually locate.
**Kevin.ly**: Exactly.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And where those printers will fall.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Yeah.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So the, any of the.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So you're any of the feeders and connections, like, are you Talking about for the control panels?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: No, no.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So you have the drop down outlets for the workstations at skypot Workstations, Device B.
**Kevin.ly**: So you have them in four locations.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So.
**Kevin.ly**: So those are.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Those are the drops for.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: For the workstations.
**Kevin.ly**: But then you have the drops, the convenience outlet drops that will be at the skypath area where they have the conveyors.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: That's where they will have printers.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Yeah, that's going to be.
**Daisuke.mine**: Yeah.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Within that same timeline where they come out.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Yeah, that's going to be right here around the same timeline.
**Daisuke.mine**: Like it's.
**Daisuke.mine**: All those drops and stuff will be.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Pretty much the same.
**Daisuke.mine**: Like we just.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: I mean there's a.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: When we get into a schedule, especially this, like we can only detail so much before.
**Daisuke.mine**: It's just.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: You're spending more time changing it than it's worth.
**Kevin.ly**: I gotcha.
**Kevin.ly**: But you just need to understand the schedule as it relates to it.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Just because it.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: It is added scope.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And then have you confirmed with Exotech that during the dropdown for the workstations, which is scheduled for 9 11, will the Skypath be ready where we know the drop down locations are going to be there or not?
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Oh, I mean we'll know.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: I mean it'll.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: They'll definitely know the locations by then.
**Daisuke.mine**: Absolutely.
**Daisuke.mine**: Yeah.
**Daisuke.mine**: I mean that's going to be figured out well in advance.
**Daisuke.mine**: I mean they'll have that with their install drawings.
**Kevin.ly**: Have you confirmed that?
**Daisuke.mine**: I mean, because I don't even.
**Kevin.ly**: I don't even have.
**Kevin.ly**: I don't even have the latest SkyPath layout yet.
**Kevin.ly**: So like where those drops occur, I still don't.
**Kevin.ly**: I don't even know it.
**Kevin.ly**: I don't even know where those printers fall just yet.
**Kevin.ly**: I have approximate locations.
**Kevin.ly**: Right.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: But what I'm saying is when they get to their field drawings, the install drawings, they'll have that.
**Daisuke.mine**: It'll be done by then.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Awesome.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Like, I didn't ask them that per se, but again, doing 15 of these things, I.
**Daisuke.mine**: They'll.
**Daisuke.mine**: They'll be ready.
**Kevin.ly**: I gotcha.
**Kevin.ly**: Okay.
**Kevin.ly**: And then moving down to item 27 and 28.
**Kevin.ly**: So myself and Brandon kind of discussed this briefly.
**Kevin.ly**: So Yusuke, what we discussed last night basically stands.
**Kevin.ly**: The main shutdown is to energize panel HE one.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So it's to shut down the MPD panel to tie in the he1.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Once the he1 is tied in, that's where they can start pulling wires and shutting out that panel alone instead of creating other shutdowns.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So we also discussed the shutdown duration.
**Kevin.ly**: And it shouldn't be three days.
**Kevin.ly**: He has that as three days, but.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: It'S really going to be a 24 hour period.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Yeah.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So what.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: What it is is the utility comes in and shuts down.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Shuts off the transformer on the exterior.
**Daisuke.mine**: Yep.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Which then kills your main distribution panel.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: And then we go in, we install a breaker, you know, tie it all in there.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Now, typically that shutdown is going to be eight hours.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: But this, you know, this process takes.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: There's a lot more that goes into it than just that.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So our guys will be working, getting all the prep work done.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: But that's usually what it is.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Keep in mind, it's also subject to the availability of the utility.
**Daisuke.mine**: Like, we are not allowed to touch that transformer.
**Daisuke.mine**: Only the utility can.
**Daisuke.mine**: So that's your.
**Daisuke.mine**: That's your.
**Daisuke.mine**: Your power provider now, understanding.
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah.
**Ilana.rozentsvayg**: So during the eight hours of shutdown, what will happen?
**Ilana.rozentsvayg**: What will happen to other equipment?
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Well, anything that's fed.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Anything that's fed out of that panel or that transformer would not have power.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Now if.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: If there's some critical stuff like, hey, we cannot shut down no matter what.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: What we've done in the past is we do a.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: A changeover and install a temporary generator that powers up whatever needs to be.
**Daisuke.mine**: Powered up during the sh.
**Ilana.rozentsvayg**: Okay, I understand.
**Ilana.rozentsvayg**: So we can do something if those HE one feeds to some important equipment or something.
**Kevin.ly**: Well, no, HE one doesn't feed anything.
**Kevin.ly**: My.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: My concern right now, Brandon.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And if you can, you and or anyone in your team can send an.
**Kevin.ly**: Email to the Henderson team regarding this.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: What?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: From the two transformers that are on the exterior, are they feeding any other tenants or any other panels that are within our space?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Because there's only two transformers that power the million square feet.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So it's definitely going to affect another tenant.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So the day that we choose is very critical at this.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: At this point.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Because there's only two transformers powering the entire warehouse.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: And that other tenant is a.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Is a sublease, correct?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I believe.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yusuke, correct me if I'm misspeaking, but all those other people are subleases, correct?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: In the warehouse?
**Ilana.rozentsvayg**: Yeah, subleases.
**Ilana.rozentsvayg**: Or we have another like automation system beside the exotics.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So yeah, it's.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So then, yeah, those.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: There's.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: There's a good chance that, you know, I don't know.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: We have to look and see what's all tied into it.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: But yes, it would shut down.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Whatever.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Now, do they work on the weekends.
**Ilana.rozentsvayg**: Like on Sunday?
**Ilana.rozentsvayg**: No.
**Ilana.rozentsvayg**: Kevin, please support me if I'm wrong.
**Stilianos.diakoumakis**: We do.
**Stilianos.diakoumakis**: Our operations team doesn't work on Sundays, but our maintenance team or the other automation does work on Sundays.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Okay, but as far as operations moving product, that doesn't happen on Sundays.
**Aelkarrimy**: Correct.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Mike, make note.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: We need to call the utility and see about doing a Sunday shutdown because that sounds like it's going to be the best, best thing because your maintenance guys can, can perform.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: They don't.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: They can perform maintenance without power.
**Daisuke.mine**: Like, they, they don't need that.
**Daisuke.mine**: That's not critical to their operation.
**Aelkarrimy**: Will do.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Does that satisfy using?
**Kevin.ly**: I think so, yeah.
**Kevin.ly**: Because the Sunday and the transformer affecting the other subleased areas is a big one.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And I just texted Brian from Henderson just to confirm or just for him to check what the transformers that were.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Well, the transformer that we're tapping into.
**Kevin.ly**: What else does it feed within that warehouse?
**Kevin.ly**: All right, so going down the list.
**Kevin.ly**: So the next item is inspections.
**Kevin.ly**: So I see FM inspections noted on.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: The schedule, but I don't see any DoB inspections or third party, like a.
**Kevin.ly**: Third party, a special inspection agency for.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Like, let's say the anchor bolts and whatnot.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So where do those inspections fall within this schedule?
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So FM is a local.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: That's fire marshal.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So he'll come in and check the sprinkler.
**Daisuke.mine**: That's what we're calling out because that's going to be important to get us out of this section.
**Daisuke.mine**: Is that fire marshal inspection as far as special inspections.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So, like anchor bolts and things like that.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So typically what happens is.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So like you'll have whatever, you know, whatever company that Exotech is using, they come in and just periodically test throughout.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So it's not like there's a certain day that they come in.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So they'll.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: They might come in three or four times or whatever because they have to see different components.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: They have to see the hole drilled and open and then see it tightened.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: And then they'll come in and check like 5% or something of the bolts.
**Aelkarrimy**: Gotcha.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So I think one of the questions is who is onboarding the special Inspection agency?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I'm not sure if exotech would be able to because then it would be conflict of interest.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Right, because they're the GC really for their work.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: I mean, we can bring somebody on to do it.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: But I mean, you're also getting like the inspecting agencies are giving you a certified report.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: I mean, yes, I guess exocetech could put some pressure on a bias.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: But you're also talking about if, if.
**Daisuke.mine**: The testing agency lied, you know, just.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: To, you know, get whatever done, then they're Opening themselves up to lawsuits and criminal.
**Daisuke.mine**: Yeah, it's.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: I mean, so yes, if that's something that you guys want us to pick up, we can pick up the anchor bolt inspections.
**Daisuke.mine**: Just, you know, let us know if that's something you want us to do.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Let me, let me see if I can just speak to a couple of agencies that we work with in house just to see how much the cost will be, because I know that if it goes into your wheelhouse, it might have a little overhead on top of that.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So let me speak to Crosscheck and the other agency and then I'll get back to everyone on that via email.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Sounds good.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And then the compressor, again, it's part of the inspection.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So like, does the compressor have its own inspection as well, or is that part of the FM inspection?
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: The fire marshal, he's not really going to care about the compressor per se.
**Daisuke.mine**: I mean, he's not going to have much to do with that.
**Daisuke.mine**: Your building inspector, you know, he's going to look at that.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: You know, they'll look at the lighting.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Like all that life safety component stuff that you see now, again, like what we'll probably end up doing is doing periodic inspections throughout.
**Daisuke.mine**: It would be foolish to wait till.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: The end and then have one inspection.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: And then if they have issues with stuff that was done, update every seven months ago, you know.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So what we'll do is we come in and we'll have them do periodic inspections just to make sure.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So for instance, what we'll probably do is when we're halfway through be is have them come out and double check.
**Daisuke.mine**: The lighting or something like that as we get stuff done.
**Daisuke.mine**: I mean, just looking at this, what's getting done, I'd say probably in this.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Mid October time frame, we would expect.
**Daisuke.mine**: To probably call it an inspection.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: But I also, again, I can put it on here, but it's going to be shifting like we're going to, you know, Mike is going to have a.
**Daisuke.mine**: Relationship with that inspector and you know.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: We'Re going to play to his, you know, that inspector might be.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: I want to come out here every, every 10% done.
**Daisuke.mine**: Like we got to play to his sheet of music.
**Kevin.ly**: 100%.
**Kevin.ly**: Okay.
**Kevin.ly**: Now the last portion is what we want to see on the schedule that's not currently reflected.
**Kevin.ly**: So just kind of panning up to the top.
**Kevin.ly**: There is one item that is somewhat concerning where it calls out owner installed tempor fence.
**Kevin.ly**: So in the bids, unless this was supplied by Yusuke and we're not aware of, but the bids call out that There is a ten foot fence with.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Eight foot gates, which kind of reflects what was shown on the logistics plan that was issued.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So I know that when you and I spoke, you were under the impression that the temporary fence is not on the, not on Aliato's scope and it's on the landlord scope.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So, but, so what, what we, what we did was in our original proposal, so we, we submitted this.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: You know, the, the, the comment came back of, hey, like, you know, we want to, you know, like, I think, you know, uniquely want to be at.
**Daisuke.mine**: 2.9 million or something like that, like, really wanted to cut stuff down, blah, blah, blah.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So what we did was we said, all right, well, we're going to cut stuff.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So our fencing number was right here.
**Daisuke.mine**: Whoopsie.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: This right here.
**Daisuke.mine**: This 15, 6.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Now, in our one that we revised, we, we pulled it out so that.
**Daisuke.mine**: It wasn't there and we set it.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Now what I'll do, since we wasn't, we weren't clear on that, and there's.
**Daisuke.mine**: Obviously miscommunication, is I will go ahead.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: And pick up that fence and install.
**Daisuke.mine**: It on my dime.
**Kevin.ly**: Okay.
**Kevin.ly**: Because I'm really sorry, Brandon.
**Kevin.ly**: It's just that we don't, I don't have any recollection of us trying to remove it.
**Kevin.ly**: And if that's something that you did in order to bring down the bid, that's not something that we caught because it was still on that Excel sheet.
**Kevin.ly**: So we were always under the impression that it's still included.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Like I said, miscommunication.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: I get it.
**Daisuke.mine**: Which is why I'll, you know, I'll own that and take care of it.
**Kevin.ly**: And then the only thing that we would need to have reflected on the schedule is the removal of the temp.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Fence, the exotech commissioning date, and live turnover versus the demobilization by the GC date.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So that, that's kind of go.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Going to need a little bit of coordination between yourself and exotech.
**Daisuke.mine**: Gotcha.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Yeah, I'll, I'll get with Joe because last I talked, the commissioning and go live date were kind of fluid.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: But we'll, I'll see.
**Daisuke.mine**: I'll get with them and try to pencil in a date to put on here so it shows it.
**Daisuke.mine**: And then I'll add a milestone to show us doing the, you know, final GC inspection and demo.
**Kevin.ly**: Brandon, when it comes to the demobilization and final GC inspection, I know that.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: You guys are demobilizing before exotech kind of goes live or turns over like turnkey is, is Is that the case currently in this, in, in your contract?
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Yeah.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So, so memory serves me correct.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Their.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Your go live date in Yuzuki, correct me if I'm wrong, is like November, I think, of 2026.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Is that right?
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Go live date.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Your go live date?
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Yeah.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Is it like November goal line date is August 1, 2026.
**Ilana.rozentsvayg**: Yes.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Yeah.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So, yeah, so, so that go live date.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So there.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So basically when all the hardware and everything is installed, which is pretty much.
**Daisuke.mine**: Everything that you see here, Exotech is.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Going to have a ton of commissioning and running of their conveyors, running the robots, you know, installing their totes, all this stuff that we don't have anything to do with.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: And you'll, you'll see the number of people on site go from 40 to 4, because they're going to spend basically three months just getting ready and commissioning and working out the quirks, software wise.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So again, we, we always have pulled off because there's nothing for us to.
**Daisuke.mine**: Do, like, but just sit there so we, we wouldn't need anything.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: And if there's anything that's messed up, we're going to find out about it well before, like, you're not going to, to be commissioning and be like, oh, there's an issue with the Racking B, like, we're going to know that.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Well, well before, and we'll catch it.
**Daisuke.mine**: All during these inspections.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: And if for some reason something is messed up that we did, then of.
**Daisuke.mine**: Course we'll come out and take care of it.
**Kevin.ly**: And then if the error is caught or the flag was caught in Skypod B, when we start Skypod A, we're taking all of those comments into, into account.
**Kevin.ly**: Right.
**Kevin.ly**: So then.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Correct.
**Kevin.ly**: So then it's, it's just kind of streamlined from there.
**Kevin.ly**: Got it.
**Daisuke.mine**: Yeah.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Obviously, Yeah.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: I mean, that's what I mean.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Trust me, we, we done these Skypod systems enough where that's what makes us good at it, because we've messed up and now we know what not to do.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So it's the same thing.
**Kevin.ly**: Brandon, one important note that I see.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: That Kevin posted in the chat, he.
**Kevin.ly**: Says that one note for weekend power shutdowns during the peak season, from November to December, our operations will run 24, seven, seven days a week.
**Kevin.ly**: So any shutdowns would have to be scheduled prior to November and December.
**Kevin.ly**: So I'm guessing because of the holiday season.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Yeah, the peak, Yeah.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: I mean, we've got this in October.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Perfect.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: And again, we would, we would do.
**Daisuke.mine**: It on a Sunday to not affect operation.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: And if there's a better Day.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Like, all we have to do is install the breaker into that main distribution panel.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So in reality, we could do that sooner.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: We could do it later.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Like, I mean, this can shift based off of your operational needs, Kevin.
**Stilianos.diakoumakis**: So, yeah, if it's possible to do earlier, the earlier the better.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Yeah.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Do you have like a time, like, hey, Brandon, if you can get it done before September or whatever?
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Like, do you have a time that you.
**Stilianos.diakoumakis**: If you can do it before September, before the Labor Day, that'd be the best.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Okay.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: We'll have to see how long it's going to take us to get that breaker, because that's going to be the biggest.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: The biggest driver is getting the breaker.
**Daisuke.mine**: On site and installing it.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So I don't know, but we'll try.
**Daisuke.mine**: To get done as early as possible.
**Stilianos.diakoumakis**: Okay.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: But, you know, as we look at the schedule, so, you know, keep in mind, this is what I was talking about in our last call, where the red items are what we call critical path.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So that means that if.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: If this item, if sprinkler install B instead of it, you know, if.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Instead of it finishing on 11 17, if it finishes on 11 20, then you would lose three days.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: It would push this end date back three days.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Now, if this right here, sprinkler main feed, if this moves two weeks, then it would not affect anything because this is blue.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: This is what we call float.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: It has room to adjust and not.
**Daisuke.mine**: Affect the critical path.
**Daisuke.mine**: Does that compute?
**Kevin.ly**: That makes sense for us.
**Kevin.ly**: Yusuke, does that.
**Kevin.ly**: Does that make sense right now?
**Ilana.rozentsvayg**: Yeah.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: What is critical, what is not?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: All right.
**Kevin.ly**: And then, Brandon, I don't know if you can pull up that PowerPoint.
**Kevin.ly**: If you could just kind of walk.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Us through the sequence of construction in.
**Kevin.ly**: Those diagrams, that would be great.
**Daisuke.mine**: See here?
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Let's see.
**Daisuke.mine**: So PowerPoint, where do I have that schedule?
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: There we go.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Yeah.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So it's pretty much the same.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Same sequence again.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: We're going to follow.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: We're going to follow exotech racking install.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So we'll start again right up here and see, start right up here in this corner.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: And as they're installing.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: What is wrong with this thing?
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: As we're.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: They're installing this racking right here, they'll start on the top row.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: You know, they get half, three quarters of the way down, whatever, we're going to come in behind them, installing our.
**Daisuke.mine**: Pipe and chasing them all the way out.
**Daisuke.mine**: So, and so.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Does that make sense?
**Ilana.rozentsvayg**: Yeah, I do.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And then, like, when we get to October 6 through 17, is that when you plan on maybe Calling like a pre inspection just to get an idea.
**Kevin.ly**: Of how we're, how we're doing and.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: If there are any issues, I say that.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: But like the first thing that we're gonna.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: One of the first things we're gonna do, like when we start, Mike will make contact with our inspector and say, you know, hey, what do you want to see?
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: When do you want me to call you?
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: How many times do you want to come out?
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Like, we have to understand what he was.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Because some inspectors would be like, nope, I've seen a thousand of these racking systems.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Just call me when you're done.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Other guys are like, I've never seen one of these.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Like, yeah, I want to come out every two weeks.
**Kevin.ly**: Noted.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yusuke, do you have any questions with regards to the PowerPoint that was supplied?
**Kevin.ly**: It pretty much takes us through Skypod B and the Skypath area, and then it takes us back to Skypod A on the top, and then they start.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Going back down again.
**Kevin.ly**: And it basically takes us all the way to 4-13-24 of 2026.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Yes.
**Ilana.rozentsvayg**: This is about the racking installation sequence, right?
**Kevin.ly**: Racking and the skypath.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: It's the entire.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Yeah, this is, this is our, our sprinkler one.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So I mean, it's the exact same path.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Like we're literally.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: We have to follow exotech.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: The only difference is whenever we get everything done in, you know, at the end of this one, then this is when we'll do our detailing.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So whenever everything's done, then we have to go in and do that detailing where we tie everything in, put water on it, and then anything that leaks, you know, we have to go in and tighten it and we'll get our fire marshal sign off on this section.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Ilana.rozentsvayg**: And some kind of cable drop, power feed, cable dropping will be done before rack installed.
**Aelkarrimy**: Right?
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: I mean some of it will.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So I mean it, you know, the.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: See where's our cable drops.
**Daisuke.mine**: Yeah.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So 9 11.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Right.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Is when we're putting on starting to.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: To do drops and stuff.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So it'll be going on the same time that they're still doing the rack install.
**Kevin.ly**: Well, I mean it says, it says set and make final connections to step down transformer.
**Kevin.ly**: So does that.
**Kevin.ly**: Is that a drop to the transformer?
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Yeah, that's a.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: That's a connection to the transformer.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Then this is your.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Your actual drops like your outlets.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Like, this is what would be an actual direct wire.
**Kevin.ly**: So by September, Yusuke, all of the drops for Skypod B should be somewhat in place while the SkyPods are being built, Erected in.
**Kevin.ly**: Oh, it's going to be in the middle of it.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah.
**Kevin.ly**: So while the racking install is happening, the feeders are being dropped and the drops are being dropped.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Really?
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Yeah.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Kevin.ly**: Nice, Nice.
**Aelkarrimy**: Understand?
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Yuzuki.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Kevin, do you guys have any other questions?
**Aelkarrimy**: No, I'm good.
**Ilana.rozentsvayg**: From me, I didn't catch all the, all the inspection kind of topics, so I'll follow Ahmed up after.
**Ilana.rozentsvayg**: But like, so how many inspection we need and what kind of things we have to inspect.
**Ilana.rozentsvayg**: And all the inspection will be requested to one company or several departments.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So, okay, so there's.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: There's two types of inspections.
**Daisuke.mine**: Okay.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So you have what's called an ahj, which means authority, having jurisdiction.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: That's going to be your building department.
**Daisuke.mine**: And your fire marshal.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So those people are going to come out and do inspections.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: The fire marshal is going to look at everything sprinklerized and life safety.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: And the building inspector is going to look at the electrical, plumbing, anything like that, he's going to look at.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: The other inspections are what's called deferred or special inspections.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: That's what Ahmed was referring to when he said the, the bolts for the bottom of the rack.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: So where that goes in, that has to be checked.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: And so you'll hire a testing firm that comes out and independently checks those.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: The.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: The city isn't going to inspect those.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: At most they might just want to report.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Ilana.rozentsvayg**: So we have to submit those kind of results to the city.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Or maybe I'm not saying that I'd have to double check.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Some cities want to see them.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: A lot of them don't.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay, I understand this might be one.
**Kevin.ly**: Of those that don't because they're very small.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Exactly.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: I don't think, I don't think they.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: They're going to.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: But again, it's something that, that we'll double check on and confirm.
**Ilana.rozentsvayg**: So mainly building inspection and also for like fire safety inspection.
**Ilana.rozentsvayg**: Two types are mainly we have to do for inspect.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Correct.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Just fire marshal and your building inspector.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Those are the two AHJ authorities having jurisdictions.
**Kevin.ly**: And then if anything there would be special inspections.
**Kevin.ly**: But we're still trying to figure out who the agency is going to be and who's onboarding this agency, whether it's Aliato Exotech or Fast Retail or even tpg.
**Kevin.ly**: So once we just have all of.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: That information in hand, we'll circle back.
**Kevin.ly**: With the team and let everyone know what are the required inspections or required special inspections really?
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Kevin.ly**: And that's other than the EHJ ones.
**Ilana.rozentsvayg**: Okay, thank you.
**Yusuke.nakanishi**: Any other Questions Okay.
**Ilana.rozentsvayg**: For me.
