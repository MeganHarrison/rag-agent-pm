## Transcript
**Awehner**: On mute.
**Awehner**: There we go.
**Awehner**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: A.J.
**Ataylor**: you had to blink.
**Ataylor**: I thought you were frozen.
**Ataylor**: It is right there.
**Ataylor**: All right, so psrs.
**Bclymer**: So my shirt blends in too with my background.
**Ataylor**: So it does.
**Ataylor**: So you can see like, you know, with this meeting, we got 30 jobs that we're running through.
**Ataylor**: Like, you know, we got six PMs now, you know, counting us doing PM work.
**Ataylor**: So as a company and other companies I work for, this is their same process of knowing the status and the health of their projects or if they need have a problem and they need to send more help or get someone to look at it.
**Ataylor**: And typically I would, when I was a pm, the Angelus diamond, for example, I did my PSR at the end of the month.
**Ataylor**: I had it done the same time I had my owner billings done.
**Ataylor**: All my subjects, sub billings were done at that time.
**Ataylor**: Like that was it.
**Ataylor**: That was the end of the month for the first of the month.
**Ataylor**: And you really want to do it by the first of the month anyways because then you get a snapshot of your budget.
**Ataylor**: You know, you get a snapshot of like all the other things that you attach to the psr, the RFI log, the submittal log, the change order log, the change request log, all Those things, the PDFs that you use as a backup for your PSR should all be done and be that last day of the month, first day of the next month.
**Ataylor**: So that's where, you know, these things get easier as you do them again and again because it becomes just a process that's easy to do because there's not a.
**Ataylor**: It's.
**Ataylor**: It shouldn't be difficult.
**Ataylor**: You should be just printing out information that's, that's in Job Planner, really, you know, other than updating your budget if you have to, you know, sometimes if you can project well enough, you.
**Ataylor**: You should really never have to adjust your budget until the end when you're settling up what was used or not used.
**Ataylor**: So I'll just go through and just.
**Ataylor**: I was going to describe line by line what each of these, each of these lines are, what they mean and where you pull that information from.
**Ataylor**: So project name, that's pretty simple.
**Ataylor**: It's whatever we got it labeled in the job folder or in Job Planner, that's the name, your project start and completion date.
**Ataylor**: Those should be, you know, at the time of acceptance.
**Ataylor**: It's either from the date we get a permit.
**Ataylor**: So it's possible you wouldn't know what our start date was, but you should have the duration that should be set and you Know if you want to put, you know if you don't know when the project is going to start because you don't have a permit yet, you can put this after permit and then completion date is 160 days or whatever that duration is after you get the go to start once you get that approved permit.
**Ataylor**: So you put that in there.
**Ataylor**: You want to know that from day one so that like everything you're doing on these ensuing months is tracking how you're doing against the original goals.
**Ataylor**: So the original contract budget should be whatever's in our proposal, whatever is accepted.
**Ataylor**: That's our budget amount.
**Ataylor**: The original fee is what it was in our proposal is the fee.
**Ataylor**: Same thing with the original insurance.
**Ataylor**: Should be what our estimate was our on the approved proposal.
**Ataylor**: So here's everything below.
**Ataylor**: Here is what you fill out each month.
**Ataylor**: So current completion date.
**Ataylor**: You should have an updated schedule.
**Ataylor**: You know, I'm just going to highlight these.
**Ataylor**: This is something you print out that goes with the PSR is the current project schedule.
**Ataylor**: So your superintendent or if you're handling it out as a pm, you should have that done and print it out the current budget.
**Ataylor**: So like I said, you want to go in there and make sure you know everything is balanced out or if it's not possible to balance it, it's just going to show the trouble.
**Ataylor**: But you want to print out your current budget that's also a part of this the current fee.
**Ataylor**: So if you've had any change orders that should be the only thing that affects your fee.
**Ataylor**: You should never move money in or out with the with the budget modification from the fee.
**Ataylor**: And the only thing that should happen is when you process a change order, it adds to it.
**Ataylor**: You know, in any change order we ever do, you no matter if we're deducting work, we never give back fee or insurance.
**Ataylor**: That's just a done deal.
**Ataylor**: So the same thing with the current insurance that should be.
**Jdawson**: Jesse, is job center set that way.
**Jdawson**: So when we do do a deduct because we set it to where it automatically applies it on a change order.
**Ataylor**: I know it's not.
**Ataylor**: They gotta fix it.
**Ataylor**: Do you have that?
**Ataylor**: I don't know.
**Ataylor**: Kevin, we did the one.
**Ataylor**: Did you send something to job planner?
**Jremillard**: No, I just had to do some math where when it adds the fees and the insurance it comes to the exact number that I'm sending.
**Ataylor**: Send an email to them and get that fixed.
**Ataylor**: We shouldn't be doing that then here current unallocated cost.
**Ataylor**: So all jobs should start out with zero unallocated costs.
**Ataylor**: Unless if there's an internal contingency, then it'll have to be an internal contingency line.
**Ataylor**: But that's your, that's your avenue to put money in when you get buyout and you can save some money.
**Ataylor**: And then just a rule of thumb, like, I understand a lot of stuff that goes on with jobs, so I understand you know, where money goes to or if there's problems.
**Ataylor**: But you should always like buy your job out.
**Ataylor**: But don't take every single penny that's left over in a budget, especially if you know you're going to have some costs coming up and put it in unallocated.
**Ataylor**: Because everything should be a gradual incline to the end of the job when it comes to the unallocated cost.
**Ataylor**: Or else it, it indicates we weren't prepared for things that were going to happen on that job.
**Ataylor**: And some things you don't know, but a lot of things, as you gain experience, you do know, like, I'm not going to give up all my paving budget because I know these guys are going to screw something up and I'm going to have to get the pavement patched or some curbs fixed or things like that.
**Ataylor**: You want to leave a little money in there, but if you got substantial savings.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: Move it to unallocated costs.
**Ataylor**: It also makes, it's an easy way to, for me, when it's.
**Ataylor**: You're balancing a budget.
**Ataylor**: If you got extra, you just take it out.
**Ataylor**: And if you need extra money in certain lines, like early on in the job, you know, we're not perfect at estimating.
**Ataylor**: We forget some things or we miss some things.
**Ataylor**: Like that's the time you, in the first couple months, you're moving money in and out of there to get all the rest of your budgets.
**Ataylor**: Right.
**Ataylor**: So that you have everything covered, you have a little extra in there.
**Ataylor**: But then this should be your kind of safety cushion in the unallocated cost if something comes up.
**Ataylor**: We didn't foresee current owner contingency.
**Ataylor**: This doesn't apply to all jobs.
**Ataylor**: Some jobs don't have an owner contingency.
**Ataylor**: So this only applies to ones that do.
**Ataylor**: And I just tracks, you know, we know if this owner's got some leeway when things come up.
**Ataylor**: Remaining buyout.
**Ataylor**: So this number should include.
**Ataylor**: It's not a number like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
**Ataylor**: It's a dollar amount.
**Ataylor**: So whatever.
**Ataylor**: If it's the final cleaning contract, if it's your doors and hardware, it's any sub or vendor on your job, the dollar amount that it's going to Take to write them a subcontractor, a PO is remaining buyout.
**Ataylor**: And that's also a number that should be obviously high in month one of a job.
**Ataylor**: But once after month one, month two by month three on a job that should be minimal at most, unless there's some special circumstance because that means you're going into your job without getting your materials secured with your subcontractors lined up.
**Ataylor**: And you know, that raises a lot of red flags on any job if this remaining buyout is still large.
**Ataylor**: And for someone like me, I just look at your budget.
**Ataylor**: There's budgets for subcontract codes.
**Ataylor**: And if there's not a commitment showing up is committed cost to that code.
**Ataylor**: I know right off the bat we don't have an approved subcontract with them.
**Ataylor**: So this isn't like these reports, you know, just make it.
**Ataylor**: You know, what I want to do is have a trust in all my team so I can just read this one report and I don't have to dive into all the details because I don't have time to look at 30 jobs and look at every detail and every piece of backup.
**Ataylor**: You put it all there if I have any questions.
**Ataylor**: But this is, you know, just an example of what that what is important and to understand what you're supposed to put in that line item each month.
**Ataylor**: And if that, if anything I'm saying doesn't make sense or I need to explain it differently, just stop me, please.
**Ataylor**: I know I'm not the best explainer in the world.
**Ataylor**: So then current projected profit.
**Ataylor**: So this should never be anything but our contractor fee, whatever it is, each month, whether it goes up or stays the same, that's all that should be in this number.
**Ataylor**: It's not insurance.
**Ataylor**: Our insurance is to cover the cost of insurance.
**Ataylor**: It's not unallocated cost because we don't know until the end of the job if that's on a calic unallocated cost or if it's going to be used to cover something.
**Ataylor**: So profit should always remain the same or be steadily going up.
**Ataylor**: So the next one here open, I call the change events.
**Ataylor**: But these are called change requests now.
**Ataylor**: So.
**Ataylor**: And this is another report that goes into your log.
**Ataylor**: Like your budget provides all these things here.
**Ataylor**: Like we can see all that.
**Ataylor**: So this is just.
**Ataylor**: This is one piece of document you need to add.
**Ataylor**: So this is another one.
**Ataylor**: You're your change request log.
**Ataylor**: Because I can look at that.
**Ataylor**: You know, if you've got 50 open change requests.
**Ataylor**: I know there's a whole lot of of unknowns and uncertainties.
**Ataylor**: Because like, if you got that many change requests that are open, that means that could.
**Ataylor**: If it's 50 of them, there's 50 things you still need to buy or there's 50 things you still don't even know how much they cost.
**Ataylor**: And there's 50 things that if an owner is paying for it, they haven't approved yet.
**Ataylor**: So it's very important that we stay on top.
**Ataylor**: Like, not.
**Ataylor**: I also firmly believe like the second anything comes up, even with RFIs, I used to, when I would send an RFI out if there was any way, shape or form that could incur cost, even if subs would tell me now, I'll throw that in, you make a change request and you send that out to the sub and say, is this got any cost impact to you?
**Ataylor**: And like I was talking to Glenn earlier, like you put the date, is it five days, is it 10 days?
**Ataylor**: You get a paper, you have an electronic paper trail with job planner where I sent it to you, I gave you 10 days in, in the notice to get me pricing.
**Ataylor**: Or it's no cost because otherwise, you know, you get on a bigger job.
**Ataylor**: And if you don't do that, you're toast at the end because you haven't documented you made a change.
**Ataylor**: If you make changes and you don't document to the sub, then you know you're liable for them coming back and say, hey, that's going to cost you more money, then you've lost your chance.
**Ataylor**: You know, typically when documents come from an architect, they give you 10 days or whatever to tell them whatever that agreement is with the owner to let them know that it's going to cost extra money or else they expect us to do it for free.
**Ataylor**: So like it starts with the change request.
**Ataylor**: The second something changes and it could incur costs, we make it.
**Ataylor**: If they're open a month later, there's either a problem and it needs to be closed, or there's a problem because we haven't addressed it, priced it, got it approved.
**Ataylor**: So that's something you have to put in these reports.
**Ataylor**: The next one's open, pcos.
**Ataylor**: So the PCO is the first document you send to an owner when you want to.
**Ataylor**: It's the change order request.
**Ataylor**: It's a proposed change order.
**Ataylor**: So if you got 15 or 20 of those open, that's also a problem because now either the owner is delaying us from doing the work if it's going to cost extra money, or we're having the subs do it anyways and Hoping the owner pays for it.
**Ataylor**: So the PCO log is something else you need to get as part of this report.
**Ataylor**: And having the number of those PCCOs, that shouldn't be a thing.
**Ataylor**: Once the PCOs approved, you don't really need anything but to process that.
**Ataylor**: But if you don't process that, then your budget doesn't change, you won't be able to bill for it.
**Ataylor**: All those things.
**Ataylor**: So sub change order is not funded.
**Ataylor**: So what this means is like I was just talking about a second ago, sometimes we can't wait for an owner to approve a change order.
**Ataylor**: We know we have to do it and we'll just write that if the sub refuses to start without a change order, we'll just give them a change order.
**Ataylor**: But again, this is all about, you know, our risk, which is if you've got $20,000 in the sub change orders that you've given that you aren't funded for, okay, the owner tells us to jump in a lake, I can handle that.
**Ataylor**: But if we've written a million dollars worth of change orders to the subs and we don't have an approved owner change order, that could sink us or sink that job for sure.
**Ataylor**: So that's another thing.
**Ataylor**: You want to track that like if you've written any commitments and that's again something you'll see right away in your budget.
**Ataylor**: Because if the change order hasn't been approved, but we wrote a subcontract change order, then they're going to go over on their, on that budget line item.
**Ataylor**: It's going to show a loss at the end of it because there's more committed cost than there's money in their subcontract.
**Ataylor**: So that's just a dollar amount of change.
**Ataylor**: Sub change orders that haven't been funded.
**Ataylor**: So this one here is not a number.
**Ataylor**: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
**Ataylor**: This will be an actual dollar amount.
**Ataylor**: We got open RFIs.
**Ataylor**: This is another report you'll include in here tracking RFIs.
**Ataylor**: Everyone knows that.
**Ataylor**: Just gotta get them open, closed and keep from delaying your project.
**Ataylor**: Open submittal.
**Ataylor**: So here's the next one.
**Ataylor**: Now, again, it's a submittal log, needs to be attached.
**Ataylor**: Now if you have a $5 million job and you send me a submittal log that's got 10 things on it, unless it's putting in one gigantic generator that has one submittal, I'm going to call out, you're full of like, you have to get submittals.
**Ataylor**: It protects us, you know, sometimes we, you know, it's going to get more and More where we got the design team involved.
**Ataylor**: But number one, if we're just putting in whatever and it doesn't get reviewed and approved, and if we're just relying on our subs to hopefully give us the best thing, like it's all about not knowing what they're putting in or when it comes to these larger projects with the design team and specifications, if you don't give the owner what they want and then the architect says, well, I didn't even look at that.
**Ataylor**: I don't know what that is, then who's stuck with it?
**Ataylor**: We're going to be stuck with it.
**Ataylor**: It protects us, it protects our subcontractors, getting submittals on everything.
**Ataylor**: And really it should be just going through your project seeing, you know, what is needed to build the job.
**Ataylor**: Now when it comes, like if it's drywall, maybe who gives a shit?
**Ataylor**: But if it's drywall in an apartment complex and you got rated walls in between them and then the sub puts in something different, they may just say, well, that's what I priced.
**Ataylor**: Or who knows?
**Ataylor**: That's just a bad example.
**Ataylor**: But like, your submittals, like that log should mirror pretty much the job as it's more.
**Ataylor**: Is it larger, more complex, you're gonna have a much bigger submittal log.
**Ataylor**: But they need to be, you know, we need to get those submittals.
**Ataylor**: We need to make sure they get approved.
**Ataylor**: Whether they're approved by us or there's something the design team needs to look at.
**Ataylor**: The submittal log 2 is the way you track your materials.
**Ataylor**: So, so, you know, if I look through there and you know, you're scheduled to, I don't know, start your structural steel next week and you got a bunch of open structural submittals, then that's a problem because we're about to build something that hasn't been approved by the engineer.
**Ataylor**: So the submittal August just a very important thing.
**Ataylor**: And open submittals, like when you get out past three, four months on the job, you shouldn't have any.
**Ataylor**: I mean, by then you should have.
**Ataylor**: Unless it's a very complex job, you should have all your submittals in approved and in those delivery dates confirmed by the sub.
**Ataylor**: Next one here, total sub billing.
**Ataylor**: So this is something, you know, these last here, these last three, these all tie together to tell us how are we doing on that job to cover our expenses, cover our subcontractor expenses so that we build the owner enough.
**Ataylor**: So this is the most important thing.
**Ataylor**: I mean, none of us want to wait to get our Paycheck every other week when we get paid.
**Ataylor**: So that money's got to come from somewhere, which means we got to make sure we bill enough.
**Ataylor**: So we cover our expenses and all of our sub expenses.
**Ataylor**: So this sub total billing each month.
**Ataylor**: So you want to count up all your vendors, like just add up whatever your vendors build.
**Ataylor**: What are your subcontractors build, you know, for the duration of the job.
**Ataylor**: Like this is all like the total amount to this date.
**Ataylor**: So like this shouldn't be 600,000 here and then 300,000 here.
**Ataylor**: If that was the actual two billings, this would be 600, then this would be 900,000 if that was the two months worth of billing we did.
**Ataylor**: So we got a total subcontractor billing of 900,000 by February in this job and then job today cost.
**Ataylor**: So this is our subcontractor billings.
**Ataylor**: It's our expenses from labor, job trailers, whatever we have to spend on that job, that's our total job to date cost.
**Ataylor**: So this you can pull from job planner.
**Ataylor**: It shows you the job to date cost there at the end of the of the budget.
**Ataylor**: And then you look at the total month, total owner billing, month ending.
**Ataylor**: So this here and there's two ways you can do it.
**Ataylor**: Like in the total sub billing, you can do it like if we hold retainage on them, it's the total amount minus retainage or it's the total amount including retainage.
**Ataylor**: You just do the same thing with the owner one way or the other.
**Ataylor**: You just want to know like when we get paid minus any retainage, if there is any on that job, it covers everything our subs have billed, everything we build, including the cost of our fee and insurance and all those things.
**Ataylor**: Like every month you want to be ahead of that.
**Ataylor**: Like Getting ahead is PM101.
**Ataylor**: Because we don't want to have to spend money out of our pocket to fund a job each month.
**Ataylor**: So does that make sense to everybody for these numbers you're putting in here?
**Ataylor**: Yes sir.
**Ataylor**: Each month you're slowly getting bigger as you add things up.
**Ataylor**: And then total owner payments on the month ending.
**Ataylor**: So this is also important so that we can get with owners.
**Ataylor**: And if they haven't paid us for a couple months, that's a bad thing.
**Ataylor**: Or if they haven't funded us for the previous month, you know they're due by the end of the month, by the time the PSR goes out.
**Ataylor**: If you, if they, you know this number is real low.
**Ataylor**: We know there's a problem.
**Ataylor**: It can make the calls and see what's going on with it and this, you know, obviously you're going to put in the Reese that, that month ending pay app.
**Ataylor**: That's another thing.
**Ataylor**: It's not called a pay app here, but hopefully that makes sense.
**Ataylor**: So, so really, I mean you do this PSR you're doing, you're attaching nine PDFs and again you just export this from Job Planner, save it in that folder.
**Ataylor**: I would always just save each one as a file and just combine them and save in the folder.
**Ataylor**: If it's too big to send, that's fine.
**Ataylor**: But it'll help you like you'll like with anything once you do enough of them.
**Ataylor**: You just become better at managing things and we all need reminders sometimes.
**Ataylor**: I forget a lot of things.
**Ataylor**: So when you got to put that report together, it'll sometimes motivate you to catch up on some things that are missing.
**Ataylor**: But for us, for me, for Brandon, like just having a high level overview of everything going on in the company, then we can look at, you know, are we able to hire some more help like in just covering all the expenses and making sure.
**Awehner**: You know, we're.
**Ataylor**: We'Re able to keep growing and do it in a, you know, a profitable fashion.
**Ataylor**: So we're working for.
**Ataylor**: So Jesse, I mean you've been around doing this for a while too.
**Ataylor**: I don't know how it compares to the reporting you've done over at Layton.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, it's pretty much the same for the monthly stuff.
**Awehner**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: Did they add anything else to theirs?
**Gducharme**: No, just this schedule attachment.
**Awehner**: Yeah.
**Gducharme**: But that's not, that's all done with the scheduling department.
**Gducharme**: So it's more of a reference thing than anything.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, that's why I'm telling you guys you're lucky to work here because you go to work for Layton and you may never know how to schedule a job.
**Ataylor**: You'll never know how to bill a job.
**Ataylor**: You'll, you'll never know how to write an owner contract, change order or owner contract.
**Ataylor**: Like and it's so true, Jesse, you probably know the same thing.
**Ataylor**: Like there's PMs that can't do the stuff you guys can do just because you have an opportunity at a mid sized companies.
**Ataylor**: It's like they get so big and then all of a sudden they, they just departmentalize everything.
**Ataylor**: And maybe they do it because they don't want someone to figure out their stick and create their own company.
**Ataylor**: I don't know.
**Ataylor**: But.
**Gducharme**: I think creature habit thing.
**Awehner**: Yeah.
**Awehner**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: So that's it.
**Ataylor**: Anybody have any questions?
**Ataylor**: So I Think we got a couple more days in this month.
**Ataylor**: And Thursday, it'd be great if everyone can get their owner billings in.
**Ataylor**: Thursday is the 31st.
**Ataylor**: There's 31 days in this month.
**Ataylor**: And like I said, yeah, Thursday, like, you're simply like working on your budget.
**Ataylor**: Should be the only thing you have to mess with to get these reports out.
**Ataylor**: If it's off in somebody and you got to adjust it other than that, you know, you can.
**Ataylor**: You're just looking at whatever's in there and you can.
**Ataylor**: It's got open submittals, you can open crs, you can filter by all these things.
**Ataylor**: So getting these numbers, you know, is not super difficult.
**Ataylor**: And it shouldn't take you more than an hour to put this thing together.
**Ataylor**: So that's what we want to get to where this is an easy form to fill out.
**Ataylor**: You get in the groove of it and then, you know, because having them come in a little sporadically, you know, if we can just set that hard date of the end of the month, the last day or the first of the following month, then it also allows me and Brandon get with the accounting team.
**Ataylor**: And we also are able to run through these at one time instead of kind of here and there.
**Ataylor**: So it'll be great.
**Ataylor**: Accounting is going to love you guys.
**Ataylor**: If we can get all these billings done by the first, like this month.
**Ataylor**: All the sub billings.
**Ataylor**: Does anyone have any open sub billings?
**Ataylor**: We finalized them all last week.
**Jdawson**: I still have a few lien waivers that either were wrong or coming back in, but I have all the.
**Jdawson**: I have all invoices otherwise.
**Ataylor**: Okay, that's good because that, like there again, like when you put those hard dates in there, if the sub doesn't get you a billing and you don't got to worry about it.
**Ataylor**: And I was a PM and I had some subs that didn't get a billing in and I'd be calling them and because I knew if I didn't get them a billing, they would not be able to pay their people the following month.
**Ataylor**: So there's some discretion there.
**Ataylor**: But other subs that, you know, like, deem is notorious that it's like whatever will bill in a month or two or whatever.
**Ataylor**: But it's, it's, it's a good thing though, when you know, you're done with the sub billings now you can simply do your owner billing and there's no surprises, cover your cost and your job's in good shape.
**Awehner**: So.
**Jdawson**: Speaking of accounting, updating the budget, I've asked them a few times in CC John, I don't know if you've seen them or not, but it takes a very long time for costs to.
**Ataylor**: Get updated on our budget.
**Ataylor**: No, but they, like, they were reinventing the wheel over there, which they're close on it.
**Ataylor**: They send me the timesheets now for every pay period, so I can see, like which jobs are getting charged to and who's charging who.
**Ataylor**: So, you know, they're getting that better.
**Ataylor**: There'll be two weeks, like basically max two week delay in, in cost hitting your job, I would say in the very near future.
**Jdawson**: So right now it's three months behind on many things.
**Bclymer**: Well, Glenn, just like everybody, like, they got 30 jobs.
**Bclymer**: So they're, they're, they're, they're getting the hang of it.
**Bclymer**: It's a new system for everyone.
**Bclymer**: So mine, mine are really late to hitting my job too, sometimes.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And I'm also notorious for not getting them stuff they need in time.
**Bclymer**: So that's something I'm working on as well.
**Bclymer**: I'm sure all of you know.
**Bclymer**: So I will be better.
**Awehner**: Yeah.
**Jremillard**: All right, Jesse, let me steal the screen for a second.
**Jremillard**: I just wanted to show that the credit change order.
**Jremillard**: So, Glenn, I just remember, so before you export the credit change order, if you go under schedule of values, you were able to delete the two lines for contractor fee and insurance, and it would just give you the amount and you can.
**Ataylor**: Well, that's good.
**Awehner**: That's it.
