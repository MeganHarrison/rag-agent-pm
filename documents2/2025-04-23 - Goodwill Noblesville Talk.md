**Jdawson**: When are you gone again?
**Speaker 3**: I'm gonna be in indy Monday through Wednesday and then on Thursday and Friday.

**Speaker 3**: Venture, I think.
**Jdawson**: Venture.
**Jdawson**: That's it.
**Speaker 3**: Oh, it's a beef fishing.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so you have see here 6.
**Jdawson**: So this is our space.
**Jdawson**: I haven't got a firm answer from Andrew yet.
**Jdawson**: But like what we need to do, Andres, is.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Is to design a school space in here and also a daycare space.
**Jdawson**: And after talking to like Andrew, if we need a little more space it would be.
**Jdawson**: We would like to propose.
**Jdawson**: Let me.
**Jdawson**: Where is this thing saved?
**Jdawson**: Andrew.
**Adelgado**: Nobles all Excel drawings folder.
**Adelgado**: Which is an estimating.
**Jdawson**: Where.
**Jdawson**: Which one is it?
**Adelgado**: This one is AC demo markups always.
**Jdawson**: Start with the date first.
**Jdawson**: 2025, 0.0 4.21 Organize them for you.
**Adelgado**: I will change that right to now.
**Jdawson**: Okay, I got it open, so don't change anything.
**Jdawson**: Do you have it open?
**Adelgado**: I have it open.
**Adelgado**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: So close yours.
**Jdawson**: Are you going to try to save anything?
**Jdawson**: You just going to close it?
**Adelgado**: I'm just going to close it.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: And then Andreas, have you seen the folder?
**Jdawson**: We got all the different files there's.
**Njepson**: Yeah, it's on drawings.
**Jdawson**: No, it's got the other drawings for this.
**Jdawson**: There's some existing drawings we found.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Njepson**: 16 space drawings.
**Jdawson**: Have you seen those?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so this here, here.
**Adelgado**: Jesse, you'll need to share your screen.
**Jdawson**: Never good enough for you, Andrew.
**Jdawson**: I just get it a try all the time.
**Jdawson**: Workforce Nick slave driver.
**Jdawson**: So we're trying to do is make a similar school here and so daycare.
**Jdawson**: I don't know where those dimensions are, but we have see events.
**Jdawson**: I'm going to call it this.
**Jdawson**: It'll be in that same folder.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And so we know we want to try and fit it somewhere in here that's possible.
**Jdawson**: I don't know.
**Jdawson**: But take this.
**Jdawson**: This.
**Jdawson**: Make this white percent.
**Jdawson**: If we're starting with a blank slate in here, we got this access door there.
**Jdawson**: So we can go over here.
**Jdawson**: We can say, you know, the bathrooms are here now, pretty much.
**Jdawson**: And so ideally, our new bathrooms would also be here somewhere.
**Jdawson**: There they almost fit.
**Jdawson**: We also.
**Jdawson**: They need a student lounge.
**Jdawson**: So we can have a student lounge in here.
**Jdawson**: That'd be similar.
**Jdawson**: And then we know we got your offices and stuff, I think.
**Jdawson**: Didn't they kind of want the director's office kind of right when you came in?
**Adelgado**: The other two Goodwill schools I've been a part of.
**Adelgado**: It's been right off the main entrance.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So, like, there's that.
**Jdawson**: Then we know they want daycare, which we go to.
**Jdawson**: Open up another file here.
**Jdawson**: Sleep.
**Jdawson**: Here's another one.
**Jdawson**: This is in a 2023 jobs folder.
**Jdawson**: Stick this one over here.
**Jdawson**: Up here or something down here.
**Jdawson**: So here we got two examples of a couple spaces.
**Jdawson**: So, you know, then we got daycare.
**Jdawson**: So this daycare, they laid it out a little different.
**Jdawson**: It's like this.
**Jdawson**: A little bigger.
**Jdawson**: Seems like it's a hip, popular place.
**Jdawson**: So we'll.
**Jdawson**: So we got this for daycare here.
**Adelgado**: Jesse, what.
**Adelgado**: What are you pressing on your keyboard or.
**Adelgado**: Oh, I see it now.
**Adelgado**: To be able to do that.
**Jdawson**: Say we could.
**Jdawson**: We could have this.
**Jdawson**: Really.
**Jdawson**: So that almost gets us there.
**Jdawson**: Then we got.
**Jdawson**: They come in here, they split off going to daycare.
**Jdawson**: Or they split off and go into the.
**Jdawson**: Into the school.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And then classrooms.
**Jdawson**: Classrooms.
**Jdawson**: And we got more classrooms.
**Jdawson**: Don't want that.
**Jdawson**: Classrooms.
**Jdawson**: And then we got some offices in here.
**Jdawson**: How many classrooms?
**Jdawson**: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
**Jdawson**: Nine classrooms.
**Jdawson**: 1, 2, 3, 3 more of those in there.
**Jdawson**: I have no idea if these dimensions are right.
**Jdawson**: You'll have to look at that.
**Jdawson**: Looks like we got.
**Adelgado**: What a beautiful school you're building.
**Jdawson**: Jesse telling you, just a dream and a click of the mouse.
**Jdawson**: And here's where Peter Slope that.
**Jdawson**: So those are that.
**Jdawson**: And then we got some offices.
**Jdawson**: So we got the other offices in there, which we would have as a daycare.
**Jdawson**: They must have a bunch of kids in Indianapolis and like a shortage of children in Columbus.
**Jdawson**: So you had of.
**Jdawson**: Let's see.
**Adelgado**: I bet the population.
**Adelgado**: The population density definitely Nobles Over.
**Adelgado**: This one's going.
**Adelgado**: Is way higher.
**Jdawson**: Is it?
**Adelgado**: Yeah.
**Adelgado**: You got Noblesville, Carmel, Westfield, Fisher's.
**Adelgado**: All right next to Noblesville, there's Columbus's.
**Jdawson**: Kind of more rural around it offices in here.
**Jdawson**: Put an off pod Some offices in there.
**Jdawson**: Back here possibly.
**Jdawson**: Or where we need some bathrooms up anyhow.
**Jdawson**: So there's bathrooms.
**Jdawson**: There we go.
**Jdawson**: Take some bathrooms like here.
**Jdawson**: Then we need a janitor closet and such in the break room.
**Jdawson**: Take this.
**Jdawson**: Got that.
**Jdawson**: See?
**Jdawson**: Break room.
**Jdawson**: Blah, blah, blah.
**Jdawson**: We got.
**Jdawson**: We got some room up here.
**Jdawson**: Maybe this was more thinking that that's room in here.
**Jdawson**: So that's where Andres, you can check some of these dimensions and see how this scales out.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: I don't know what the difference was on these plans.
**Jdawson**: These didn't have a scale to them.
**Jdawson**: It may be serenity room there and everything.
**Jdawson**: Maybe let's move down this here.
**Jdawson**: I mean, on the end we could book in two offices.
**Jdawson**: Do we have so electric and it get storage.
**Jdawson**: We don't have an it room.
**Jdawson**: So we can make that kind of a central room.
**Jdawson**: To where?
**Jdawson**: Source storage.
**Jdawson**: Trying to think.
**Jdawson**: I think it was in here maybe.
**Jdawson**: Or was it here?
**Jdawson**: It was in here.
**Jdawson**: We can always do that in put.
**Jdawson**: That's storage.
**Jdawson**: And then this.
**Adelgado**: Janitor.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, here's storage and janitor right here.
**Jdawson**: This can be I t as well.
**Jdawson**: Like.
**Jdawson**: Well, they're going to want that their own room.
**Jdawson**: So maybe this becomes an it closet.
**Adelgado**: Student lounge, cafeteria right here.
**Jdawson**: Here's your student lounge.
**Jdawson**: Cafeterias right here.
**Jdawson**: Hallway here.
**Adelgado**: Usually two main bathrooms and then two teacher bathrooms.
**Adelgado**: Break room.
**Jdawson**: And this wall here just ends.
**Jdawson**: So here we go.
**Jdawson**: Perfect.
**Jdawson**: It closet.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Find.
**Jdawson**: I mean wire size.
**Jdawson**: Would be better to have the it closet further up here.
**Jdawson**: Storage room there it.
**Jdawson**: There you go.
**Jdawson**: Done.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So if you can.
**Jdawson**: So then like this is the vestibule.
**Jdawson**: So they can come in either these double doors here or into the daycare.
**Jdawson**: Come in and go here.
**Jdawson**: Here.
**Jdawson**: You know, the only thing they may want to.
**Speaker 3**: They want the laundry room.
**Jdawson**: Are you right.
**Jdawson**: Where's our laundry room?
**Jdawson**: It's off the picture.
**Jdawson**: We got one here.
**Jdawson**: We have a laundry station.
**Jdawson**: Laundry there.
**Jdawson**: Daycare.
**Jdawson**: You know, now to think about it.
**Jdawson**: Put this back around.
**Jdawson**: Oops.
**Adelgado**: Yeah.
**Adelgado**: Conference and staff room in there.
**Jdawson**: Well, I think here's the break room.
**Jdawson**: Oh, the staff room.
**Jdawson**: You're right.
**Jdawson**: Staff.
**Jdawson**: They give a.
**Adelgado**: And stuff.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, they'd probably rather have that these back up here.
**Jdawson**: We'll have bathrooms here.
**Jdawson**: It's thing over here or something.
**Jdawson**: Figure that one out for a second.
**Jdawson**: But that'd be better anyways to be like kind of even rooms to every even distance.
**Jdawson**: Everything.
**Jdawson**: And then that sa.
**Jdawson**: And then it shows the columns on here.
**Jdawson**: Andre.
**Jdawson**: So you're Gonna have to figure all that out too.
**Jdawson**: Like where these columns are.
**Jdawson**: These right here.
**Jdawson**: Here.
**Jdawson**: You know, you can fudge these.
**Jdawson**: These rooms aren't all specific.
**Jdawson**: They just like to keep them at least, you know, I don't know what it is.
**Jdawson**: 25ft by whatever feet.
**Jdawson**: Okay, but if the daycare is here and this is the entry to daycare, like this will be the entrance to come in the daycare and they drop the kids off at the pool, means they take them in the bathroom first, then laundry.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, here, bathrooms, laundry.
**Jdawson**: Here's the door to come in.
**Jdawson**: So they would just come through these doors and then go into here.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that makes sense.
**Jdawson**: What else am I missing?
**Jdawson**: I'll let you guys think about it for one second.
**Jdawson**: I'll be back.
**Adelgado**: Classrooms, daycare, bathroom.
**Adelgado**: And at least from what I can see perspective, it looks good.
**Adelgado**: Trying to think functionality wise.
**Jdawson**: All right, what else can you guys think of we're missing in here?
**Jdawson**: We got some, you know, some space planning Andres is going to do for us, you know, because we got big hallways here.
**Speaker 3**: Does that.
**Speaker 3**: More offices than the other.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, but they're always short of offices, so they like that.
**Jdawson**: Now the corridors, I don't think it.
**Adelgado**: Has six offices, but it looks like this one's going to have more classrooms, so they probably need more offices.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: Daycare might need to be a little bigger if they're going to have more people or at least bigger than the standard daycare.
**Adelgado**: Sure.
**Adelgado**: How many bathrooms are there?
**Adelgado**: Four.
**Adelgado**: Two.
**Jdawson**: Two here, two there.
**Jdawson**: This is right across from the staff break room so they can eat their sandwich, take a storage guy, can come right in, mop up after their mess.
**Adelgado**: I wonder if with the amount of classrooms and occupancy load, if they're going to require an extra bathroom or so.
**Jdawson**: What do you mean this is the same?
**Adelgado**: Oh, good point.
**Adelgado**: It's all from the same.
**Jdawson**: I mean, this is.
**Jdawson**: We had nine and see here, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
**Jdawson**: In Sloan, we have 1, 2, 3, 4th, 5, 6, 7,8, 9 here.
**Adelgado**: Sloan did have two of the double bathrooms.
**Jdawson**: Oh, they did.
**Jdawson**: Well, that these were existing.
**Adelgado**: Yeah, they had two double.
**Adelgado**: And I don't know if they had.
**Adelgado**: But they didn't have teacher restrooms.
**Adelgado**: Trying to walk the building right now in my head.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, they did these one.
**Jdawson**: Oh, they had one gym.
**Adelgado**: They had one in the cafeteria too.
**Adelgado**: That was existing.
**Jdawson**: The cafeteria.
**Jdawson**: And then this one there.
**Jdawson**: One.
**Jdawson**: No, I guess there wasn't one there.
**Jdawson**: Maybe that's.
**Jdawson**: The teachers just went in and used those little bodies.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we have.
**Jdawson**: And this is just hanging over here a little bit.
**Jdawson**: Is it meant to be?
**Adelgado**: I know this building well.
**Adelgado**: It's funny, when I pulled in, I was like.
**Adelgado**: I've been here before.
**Jdawson**: Used to shop there.
**Adelgado**: Well, there's a.
**Adelgado**: It's been like.
**Adelgado**: It's just outside of downtown Noblesville, which is a pretty popular area.
**Adelgado**: And the community college I actually went to because I graduated high school early and filled in some gap time there.
**Jdawson**: Because you're so much smarter than the rest of us.
**Adelgado**: No, no, that's definitely not the case here.
**Speaker 3**: What is it?
**Speaker 3**: What is it right now, Andrew?
**Speaker 3**: That building.
**Adelgado**: Big lots.
**Adelgado**: But it might have been like.
**Adelgado**: When I was walking with the electrician, he thought it might have been a grocery store or something.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, it started out a grocery store and then I think it became a bit.
**Jdawson**: Because these drawings were.
**Jdawson**: When they change it to a big lots.
**Adelgado**: Yeah, there's like a.
**Adelgado**: In the panel room, there's like an EMS and Starlink service and a lot of stuff.
**Jdawson**: Starlink.
**Jdawson**: Is this where Elon got started?
**Adelgado**: He has some sort of company or starlink, I think is his WI Fi.
**Adelgado**: It's like.
**Adelgado**: Like WI Fi providing service, but I don't know if that's what that.
**Adelgado**: At least I've never seen it in person.
**Adelgado**: It'll be interesting to see what that tenant space ends up being.
**Adelgado**: How you have it with the green just.
**Adelgado**: They're the only ones in the dock.
**Adelgado**: Doors and everything.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Well, I mean, if this other side becomes something, they'll probably have to.
**Jdawson**: I don't know they're gonna do.
**Jdawson**: But we have it.
**Jdawson**: Closet.
**Adelgado**: We already got a demo number from integrity is like 18,000 or something.
**Jdawson**: That's it.
**Jdawson**: Nice.
**Adelgado**: A lot of ceiling to remove.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Guess they kind of like having these of open areas a little bit.
**Jdawson**: Just kind of breaks things up.
**Adelgado**: A jail or something was just straight lines.
**Jdawson**: They had conference room, teachers lounge, storage.
**Jdawson**: You got it.
**Jdawson**: Classroom.
**Jdawson**: We got it.
**Jdawson**: Got it.
**Jdawson**: One, two, three.
**Jdawson**: We got.
**Jdawson**: There's no food prep resource officer offices like this one here.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, they only have 1, 2, 3.
**Jdawson**: This office was gigantic.
**Jdawson**: 4, 5, 6.
**Jdawson**: Storage room.
**Jdawson**: Tea.
**Jdawson**: You know, if they need to put another.
**Jdawson**: I don't think they would need another bank of bathrooms, but daycare.
**Jdawson**: Can't remember what those were.
**Adelgado**: Refrigerators.
**Jdawson**: Oh, they had two fridges.
**Jdawson**: I thought this was the first.
**Adelgado**: I don't think anything went.
**Adelgado**: Did you pull that from the Sloan daycare?
**Adelgado**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah, that one.
**Jdawson**: These are the baby changing stations.
**Jdawson**: I'm pretty sure they put them outside of the bathrooms.
**Adelgado**: Oh, I Don't know if I've ever seen those.
**Jdawson**: So there you go.
**Jdawson**: And then, you know, everything we've learned on these last.
**Jdawson**: The last one, Nick, you know, about the bath accessories and about the flooring and all those things we want to just kind of combine into our thinking on this one.
**Jdawson**: It's like that is one thing, like, oh, that's not like they need more space.
**Jdawson**: But if this was brought here, then the window would see into this vestibule or.
**Jdawson**: Or even better, because he wants to kind of.
**Jdawson**: He wants to get rid of this whole thing if possible.
**Jdawson**: So what they're having us do on a couple other facilities we're looking at.
**Jdawson**: Like see here?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: This set up here.
**Adelgado**: It almost would be nice to meet with the building inspector at the start too.
**Adelgado**: Just to get on good terms and prevent a Bloomington or Columbus scenario.
**Adelgado**: I don't know if that's a.
**Jdawson**: Are you talking about.
**Jdawson**: We want to piss them off right off the bat, right out of the gate.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So then they come in, get in as best available.
**Jdawson**: And then this window here.
**Adelgado**: I wonder if Goodwill is going to want to add windows where those classrooms are in the exterior wall.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: Of course, this is here.
**Adelgado**: They can just add those new picture frame TVs and that look like a window.
**Jdawson**: There you go, walk in, she sees them.
**Jdawson**: Boom, puts them in.
**Jdawson**: They go through there.
**Adelgado**: This question's on, but also off topic.
**Adelgado**: The other two spaces outside of the Excel center, as of now, are we just under in the understanding of ripping it down to the bones and we're just going to leave it like that?
**Jdawson**: Well, we don't.
**Jdawson**: He's going to talk to Landlord about that.
**Jdawson**: Our plan currently was to demo everything out, but we'll see.
**Adelgado**: Nice.
**Adelgado**: Some tenants for that space.
**Adelgado**: Make Goodwill happy and then win the work.
**Jdawson**: That's right.
**Jdawson**: So here's a good starting point, Andres.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Just take those drones, get yourself a.
**Jdawson**: You know, I don't know how you import that, but just make a clean floor plan like the overall and then make this our space.
**Jdawson**: See these classrooms, like 25ft and they're length on these, that's shown 36ft with a little three foot vestibule.
**Jdawson**: So these are like 40ft by 25ft.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: Again, like this column, like this columns right here.
**Jdawson**: So maybe we shipped everything down.
**Jdawson**: So this.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Then again they're spaced out like this.
**Jdawson**: So maybe from this one to this one is here to here.
**Jdawson**: You know, maybe there's some columns in here.
**Jdawson**: You just work that in there.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: What time tomorrow will you be done with this.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Njepson**: Like this hour.
**Jdawson**: No.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: If you could be, that'd be awesome.
**Jdawson**: I don't know how long this will take you to get, but it's just something.
**Jdawson**: If you could get, like, you know, just the rough thing drawn in here, that'd be pretty sweet, you know.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: You don't have to detail anything out, but if you just lay your walls all out and we can give them a room.
**Njepson**: Just the walls.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Just put all the walls in and then.
**Jdawson**: Because it doesn't make a difference to put all these.
**Jdawson**: Well, if we can just label them.
**Jdawson**: Laundry.
**Jdawson**: Restroom.
**Jdawson**: Restroom.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: You know, the break room.
**Jdawson**: This is staff lounge.
**Jdawson**: Really?
**Jdawson**: The storage.
**Jdawson**: And definitely make this storage smaller when you do yours.
**Jdawson**: Like.
**Jdawson**: Like the staff lounge looked a little small compared to the store.
**Jdawson**: And maybe they'll want this janitor closet.
**Jdawson**: No one's ever in there.
**Jdawson**: Make the break room a little bigger.
**Jdawson**: Just kind of a thin janitor closet.
**Jdawson**: Fill it all in.
**Jdawson**: We'll get started with that and we'll see.
**Jdawson**: See what they think about it.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Njepson**: Perfect.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Then you can work with Nick and Andrew.
**Jdawson**: You can.
**Jdawson**: Then we can.
**Jdawson**: Once we get a layout approved, then we can start working in all the details and whatnot.
**Adelgado**: For Goodwill Foundations.
**Adelgado**: Andres, are we.
**Adelgado**: Have you been able to send everything out to all the subs and especially like the painters with all the lead.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Adelgado**: And whatnot.
**Njepson**: I follow up.
**Njepson**: All the.
**Njepson**: All the subs.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Njepson**: But I just call two of them.
**Njepson**: Well, I need to call another substool to give the.
**Njepson**: All the.
**Njepson**: All the quotes, you know, but yes, I have sent the.
**Njepson**: The code request.
**Adelgado**: Awesome.
**Adelgado**: Yeah, I think with the abatement, it kind of gives us a good.
**Adelgado**: It kind of buys us some time to let them get their numbers in.
**Adelgado**: So.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: I don't know.
**Adelgado**: Maybe try to get everything finalized by mid next week is my feel like would be a good time.
**Adelgado**: I don't know, Jesse, if you have a time frame, you'd like to see all that.
**Jdawson**: Well, we got demo started.
**Jdawson**: We need to.
**Jdawson**: And break out.
**Jdawson**: Here's a couple things that.
**Jdawson**: Because we got to get our number down to.
**Jdawson**: I don't know what the number is going to be yet.
**Jdawson**: So let's get this revised pricing in first based on, you know, what this actually is.
**Jdawson**: And then we'll see.
**Jdawson**: We may have to trim a few things out to get them to where they want to be.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Adelgado**: But would you like to see as much of it back by what, next Wednesday?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, for sure, for sure.
**Njepson**: Next.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Adelgado**: And yeah.
**Adelgado**: Andres, if you need any help or you need me to cover some.
**Adelgado**: Some divisions, let me know and I can reach out to some of the guys.
**Njepson**: Yeah, I will send you.
**Njepson**: Amen if I need help.
**Njepson**: Thank you.
**Speaker 3**: All right.
**Jdawson**: And then for Tremont.
**Jdawson**: So when you sent that drawing, Nick, you left some of the older drawings in there, which gets kind of confusing.
**Jdawson**: You know, the original plan is not the original plan.
**Jdawson**: Let me do something real quick and I'll pull that drawing up here.
**Jdawson**: See here is it.
**Jdawson**: N O B L E S B I L L E.
**Adelgado**: N O B L E S V I L L.
**Jdawson**: E.
**Jdawson**: Let's get the dimensions in there first.
**Jdawson**: Make sure everything fits.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so I'm going to close this, Andres, if you want to go, you should be good to go and get it going.
**Njepson**: Okay, I will draw it.
**Njepson**: Thank you.
**Jdawson**: Thanks.
**Jdawson**: See ya.
**Njepson**: See you.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so.
**Speaker 3**: Oh, do you, you want me to stay on?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So what you sent.
**Speaker 3**: Those few drawings that you updated?
**Speaker 3**: I, I had slip sheeted them into the old set.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: But.
**Jdawson**: But that kind of.
**Jdawson**: I would have just left the old set out.
**Jdawson**: Really?
**Jdawson**: Because so, because like this sheet, like this wall is crooked, is cockeyed.
**Jdawson**: We could have noted that other than that existing plan, this thing, demo plan.
**Jdawson**: Taking these out.
**Jdawson**: We're not taking this out anymore.
**Jdawson**: Taking this out.
**Jdawson**: So this, we don't do this anymore.
**Jdawson**: So that saves a little bit.
**Jdawson**: But all this stays the same.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: And then there's a new layout.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And then it's not so bad.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Then this like could have left us out because now the.
**Jdawson**: Or the stair, you could have 416.
**Jdawson**: You know, you just shoot this stair in here so it kind of looks like it's there.
**Jdawson**: But.
**Jdawson**: So I guess it ain't that bad.
**Jdawson**: But you might follow up with the phone call to Tara and just call her and just see.
**Jdawson**: Maybe she didn't see her emails or something.
**Jdawson**: I don't know how she is responding to emails.
**Jdawson**: Hey, but what I'm saying is if Glenmar thinks they got to build this new wall back and demo this wall for the demo guy, those are two things that are going to change, you know, or they didn't show a demo and now we need to demo it.
**Jdawson**: So that wall needs to come up, you know.
**Speaker 3**: You want me to go through and mark up the Ultrons?
**Speaker 3**: So.
**Speaker 3**: So it's.
**Jdawson**: Well we have like, like this here.
**Jdawson**: So new construction.
**Jdawson**: Like the demo plan.
**Jdawson**: Like this should be a dotted line.
**Jdawson**: No, because we're like this should just show this wall where it is.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And then we're demoing the backside of this office.
**Jdawson**: You know what I'm saying?
**Speaker 3**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Because this is a new layout.
**Jdawson**: We move this wall over, this stays.
**Jdawson**: Well, if we do need to then add like demo.
**Jdawson**: Actually, that'll stay.
**Jdawson**: We're just going to build up on the inside of it.
**Jdawson**: I'll be adding.
**Jdawson**: And you may just leave that open until it gets to the wall.
**Jdawson**: We'll just put a rail on it until it gets up to there.
**Jdawson**: Let's see here.
**Jdawson**: Where is this thing downloaded?
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So like on existing plan, this should show this wall angling off.
**Jdawson**: Everything else is the same on this plan.
**Jdawson**: Show demo.
**Jdawson**: Leave that.
**Jdawson**: Hey, Glenn.
**Jdawson**: How much you want to.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: Oh, no problem.
**Jdawson**: I was just trying to get through it.
**Jdawson**: Just a lot.
**Jdawson**: No.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: I was just on the phone with Anders.
**Jdawson**: I'm in a conference with Nick and Andrew.
**Jdawson**: We will.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So Andres is finishing up the pricing and he will.
**Jdawson**: We're looking for Wednesday of next week to.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And be able to update that.
**Jdawson**: They started yesterday.
**Jdawson**: I went over, checked on them again today.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: If they're going to be taking too long, they might be either end of this week, then next week.
**Jdawson**: Well, we need to.
**Jdawson**: Need to.
**Jdawson**: We'll be fine without a contract at the moment.
**Jdawson**: We just need to get that thing wrapped up so we can get to a file number.
**Jdawson**: So they want to do it for 2:50.
**Jdawson**: So, you know.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So what we need to do is look at, you know, what we got to get the final cost in is we don't know what that is.
**Jdawson**: We're just kind of guessing.
**Jdawson**: And once we get that, then we can.
**Jdawson**: Based on what, 303 in bids.
**Jdawson**: Oh, from actual quotes or do we just plug numbers, though?
**Jdawson**: That just plugged a bunch of numbers.
**Jdawson**: I know, but we don't.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, so we just need to get it finalized with the numbers that come in next Wednesday, and then we'll be able to know where that number really is.
**Jdawson**: Polish concrete, level one.
**Jdawson**: We have to do that.
**Jdawson**: Polish concrete.
**Jdawson**: A lot of labor that.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, it's a different look.
**Jdawson**: It's a different look now.
**Jdawson**: It's.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we're staying with polished concrete, too.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So did I snag on to this one?
**Jdawson**: I got a bunch of lines in there, but, like, the stairs will look somewhere like that.
**Jdawson**: This platform will be up there now.
**Jdawson**: So this and then up to there, this corner into here, there, there.
**Jdawson**: These offices.
**Jdawson**: These don't change.
**Jdawson**: This becomes offices.
**Jdawson**: So there's a little.
**Jdawson**: A little different.
**Jdawson**: Like this 3D will change, but that's when we have Abinob update his.
**Jdawson**: Then all this stuff will show up.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Speaker 3**: Should I be sending this to someone?
**Jdawson**: No, but I'm just saying like this kind of confuses that you said, do you like the updated layout when all this.
**Jdawson**: You know, we should have probably left these pages out and just sent them.
**Jdawson**: That's why I think talked to Tara, asked her hopefully.
**Jdawson**: I didn't.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Because I thought I copied on the email.
**Jdawson**: I center that just had these change sheets.
**Speaker 3**: What's the deal with doing changing the exterior wall?
**Jdawson**: What exterior?
**Jdawson**: Because they got shelving.
**Jdawson**: It's a warehouse on the outside.
**Jdawson**: They'd have to move warehouse shelving and change all their things out.
**Jdawson**: Here in the warehouse is this like there's warehouse shelving that goes along this wall and this wall.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: I don't have to move all that to make this straight.
**Jdawson**: And we don't like this is less work for us, less deck to build all that.
**Jdawson**: And then these stairs, like if they left the wall, the stairs would be all the way out here somewhere.
**Jdawson**: And they don't want to lose this eight foot corridor they got here, you know, because if you come in here, there's racking along here that goes all the way to the end and then.
**Speaker 3**: So that's actually an interior wall, it's not an exterior?
**Jdawson**: No.
**Jdawson**: I thought you went there.
**Speaker 3**: I didn't walk back in that area.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: This is an exterior wall and this is an exterior wall.
**Jdawson**: Everything else is on the inside.
**Speaker 3**: Do we have to go on that other meeting?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: All right, I'll see you.
**Adelgado**: How long do you have, Jesse, or do you have to go right now?
**Jdawson**: Oh.
**Speaker 3**: It'S going to be at least an hour.
**Adelgado**: Okay, I'll just send them an email.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
