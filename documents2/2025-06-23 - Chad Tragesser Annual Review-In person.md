## Transcript
**Bclymer**: How we doing, Chad?
**Ctragesser**: Good.
**Ctragesser**: Jesse.
**Ctragesser**: Hold on one second.
**Ctragesser**: Grabbing some paper.
**Ctragesser**: Sorry about that.
**Bclymer**: No problem.
**Ctragesser**: Is Brandon down in Florida?
**Bclymer**: No, he's there.
**Bclymer**: He had some acupuncture treatment he was.
**Ctragesser**: Getting this morning because that team's messaged him, like, at 9:30, like, hey, do you just want me to do mine virtual from the job site since I got all this steel today and never heard back from him.
**Ctragesser**: And I was like, I got here to the office and I'm like, okay, yeah.
**Bclymer**: Let'S see with him.
**Bclymer**: Just a second.
**Bclymer**: Let me text him.
**Ctragesser**: He may have just walked in.
**Ctragesser**: He did.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So still showing up.
**Bclymer**: It's awesome.
**Bclymer**: But you got Andrew and Ian out there, right?
**Ctragesser**: Yep.
**Ctragesser**: Yep.
**Ctragesser**: So we got steel showing up.
**Ctragesser**: Truck one's already been unloaded.
**Ctragesser**: He's gone.
**Ctragesser**: Truck two is on site.
**Ctragesser**: They were just starting to unload him.
**Ctragesser**: Truck three is on site.
**Ctragesser**: I've got him staged.
**Ctragesser**: Truck four and five, I've got staged up at grand park in lot C, which is a mile north of us.
**Ctragesser**: That was the best place I could think to know stage them because the Le Master, they can't give us a schedule of when what's going to show up when on that steel.
**Ctragesser**: They just said, no, it's all coming.
**Ctragesser**: That's all we get told.
**Ctragesser**: And all the truck drivers, I hoping, you know, they would all be in communication with each other.
**Ctragesser**: Of course, the first truck driver, he's like, nope.
**Ctragesser**: He goes, I don't know anything about anybody else coming out here.
**Ctragesser**: So.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Ctragesser**: Yeah.
**Ctragesser**: So I just.
**Ctragesser**: We took lot C up the Grand Park.
**Ctragesser**: I mean, truck.
**Ctragesser**: Semi trucks park there all the time.
**Ctragesser**: Perfect mile up the road.
**Ctragesser**: All right, Jesse, go ahead and let you get started.
**Bclymer**: All right, Chad.
**Bclymer**: Well, thanks for coming in and appreciate everything you've done so far.
**Bclymer**: I turned my video on, but it'll probably jam it up because I'm working off a hotspot.
**Bclymer**: Our Internet's down here in the office.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: We appreciate what you've been doing so far, so we'll go through it.
**Bclymer**: First question, if you feel like you're being compensated appropriately.
**Bclymer**: Appropriately.
**Bclymer**: He said yes.
**Bclymer**: So that's good.
**Bclymer**: And as always, you know, as you move on and move on to bigger and better things for us, your pay is gonna.
**Bclymer**: You'll be compensated for it.
**Bclymer**: True.
**Bclymer**: Have you made any costly mistakes?
**Bclymer**: If so, what were they?
**Bclymer**: You know, that survey, that could have been bad.
**Bclymer**: You know, it just happens they started their layout from the end that hadn't changed first.
**Bclymer**: So it's definitely something in the future, we want to make sure we got dialed in.
**Ctragesser**: So, yeah, like I said, math is what we live and breathe by.
**Ctragesser**: You know, measurements.
**Ctragesser**: Super important.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Is that all?
**Bclymer**: If they made a decision not to get off course here, but what that volleyball area is going to look like at the end of the day, or who's leading that?
**Ctragesser**: What, the outdoor courts?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Like where the fence stops.
**Bclymer**: What are we putting back up to protect the dining area?
**Ctragesser**: They're taking that whole fence down.
**Ctragesser**: Yeah, they're going to leave the fence.
**Ctragesser**: She wants to leave the fence down.
**Ctragesser**: Yes.
**Ctragesser**: She's going to take all the fence down to the west and a little section of about 40ft left.
**Ctragesser**: And then he's going to have somebody tie what the.
**Ctragesser**: He sighed in.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Ctragesser**: And she talked about they'll put some type of netting from basically the second story balcony down to keep any balls from going from the outdoor courts and, you know, hitting anybody on the patio.
**Bclymer**: You don't want to hear, not my face.
**Bclymer**: Somebody at the.
**Bclymer**: Somebody eating dinner.
**Ctragesser**: Right.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: Have you done things above and beyond your position to save, make the company money?
**Bclymer**: If so, what were they?
**Bclymer**: Help streamline the project, Willing to help others when needed.
**Bclymer**: Just a question.
**Bclymer**: What have you seen beneficial from streamlining the project to be safe?
**Bclymer**: To schedule.
**Ctragesser**: Schedule Resources.
**Ctragesser**: Yes.
**Ctragesser**: Schedule and resources.
**Ctragesser**: I think we, Glenn, myself and Andrew and even Ian's help pitch in on just, you know, not to take Brandon's catchphrase, but, you know, the be urgent early kind of thing.
**Ctragesser**: You know, we're just going through everything each day, and it's almost, you know, like I told Ian earlier, I said, I know it's repetitive, but, you know, one of these days, it's going to be something we catch that would have jammed us up later.
**Ctragesser**: So.
**Ctragesser**: And then that's like, you know, right now, Ian's doing a steel plan as they erect.
**Ctragesser**: Okay, this column was set today.
**Ctragesser**: This beam is going to be set.
**Ctragesser**: So he's.
**Ctragesser**: He's going to take that.
**Ctragesser**: I gave him that one.
**Ctragesser**: Andrew's working on, like, all the electrical that's going in underground.
**Ctragesser**: He's tracking how those guys are doing that.
**Ctragesser**: So.
**Ctragesser**: Because I was gonna do it, I was like, well, you know what?
**Ctragesser**: This is something you guys can do.
**Ctragesser**: Perfect.
**Ctragesser**: Yeah.
**Ctragesser**: Well, it's not only, you know, it's.
**Ctragesser**: It's great to.
**Ctragesser**: For learning.
**Ctragesser**: Right.
**Ctragesser**: And when you talk about schedule, being able to track production, you can easily see, like, hey, you did this, this, this, and this, and there's no confusion.
**Ctragesser**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Ctragesser**: And then every day, you know, I think you.
**Ctragesser**: You can.
**Ctragesser**: What I usually do is I'll save that, you know what got done today like that, that sheet, I'll save it as a file and upload it to the daily report.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Ctragesser**: So that way I'm, you know, I can always get back and be care exactly what got done today.
**Ctragesser**: That was, I was doing that a lot when United was doing their under their storm and you know, I was doing it more because United kept changing out their crews.
**Ctragesser**: So it's okay.
**Ctragesser**: Well Brandon's crew can put in 600ft of pipe a day but Chad's crew's only done 200ft.
**Ctragesser**: Right.
**Ctragesser**: Why the heck did you move Brandon's crew out and give me this guy?
**Ctragesser**: Yeah, you know, so.
**Bclymer**: One thing we.
**Ctragesser**: Asked, making it one file and like literally I put the date okay, they got from here to here.
**Bclymer**: One thing we ask everyone to do is to take a look at their, you know, we have our standard operating procedure and like each person's, you know, the superintendent's roles, PM's rules, etc and always you want to review that, make sure like all of those things you're doing and then when you think of things you can do above and beyond, it's things that aren't part of your, you know, what your current job is.
**Bclymer**: So as you grow and get better and want to learn other things, then that's how you do it.
**Bclymer**: You get out of your box a little bit.
**Bclymer**: As long as you cover everything you're supposed to be doing like then you can reach out and go above and beyond.
**Bclymer**: Next one was what are you doing?
**Bclymer**: Well cross functional collaboration, maintaining strong relationships across teams.
**Bclymer**: Deliver high quality results on time and adapt quickly to changing priorities.
**Bclymer**: My communication has always also contributed to team alignment.
**Bclymer**: So that's one thing too.
**Bclymer**: Like we want, you know, I know there's some friction a little bit between you and Glenn and you know, you never know which PM you're going to be working with on a job.
**Bclymer**: So you know, sometimes when may not to be the easy thing to do but when, if you're not getting along and you're not a team, you know, working together that it usually doesn't go so well.
**Bclymer**: And I've been in the same position where I had PMs that I didn't particularly like working for but at some point you gotta just go have a beer, figure things out and agree to disagree on certain things but you know, you don't want your job it being harder for you to do what you got to do just because of a, you know, personality conflict.
**Bclymer**: So it's good like it Seems like this is what you want to do is make, you know, get the team aligned.
**Bclymer**: And sometimes you gotta just figure out what it takes to get that alignment.
**Ctragesser**: Yeah, I mean, like, always think about, like, just in general, like, remember that, like, nobody actually wins an argument, right?
**Ctragesser**: Because at the end of the day, like, you're gonna make that other person, you know, feel bad about themselves.
**Ctragesser**: They're gonna hold remorse, whatever that is.
**Ctragesser**: So if you, if you remember that and always think about, how can we come to common ground and think about, all right, how does, how does this other person feel?
**Ctragesser**: Right?
**Ctragesser**: Am I attacking them?
**Ctragesser**: Blah, blah, like always trying to, to pull things off to the side if you can, because, you know, essentially you guys can have disagreements amongst yourselves, but then outside of that, to everybody else, whatever the decision is, it's a united front.
**Ctragesser**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yep, that's right.
**Bclymer**: That's good.
**Bclymer**: Next one was, where can you improve?
**Bclymer**: Enhancing my skills with technology and learning from my superiors.
**Bclymer**: So that's, that's good.
**Bclymer**: Technology is changing daily.
**Bclymer**: I can't keep up with it.
**Bclymer**: Brandon, he's kind of a geek, so he gets in there and looks at all this new stuff.
**Ctragesser**: But Jesse's still struggling with electricity.
**Bclymer**: Oh, my God.
**Bclymer**: Light switches.
**Ctragesser**: They're just jealous of us, Jesse.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, Ignorance is bliss sometimes.
**Bclymer**: So I'd rather not know about some of this new stuff.
**Ctragesser**: That's why he's so blissful.
**Bclymer**: So is there anything in particular when you talk about technology or learning from superiors that you'd wish we'd spend more time going over with you?
**Ctragesser**: Oh, I mean, like, perfect example I'll use is the email you sent out last week or the week before about, okay, this is how we do a schedule.
**Ctragesser**: And you know, the no fault Brandon, he goes 800 miles an hour when he's on site and it's like, okay, Brandon, number one, lay off the energy drinks, buddy.
**Ctragesser**: But it's like, it's nice to have that video because then it's okay.
**Ctragesser**: No, I get to play it at my speed and I'm more of a visual person, so.
**Ctragesser**: Okay, cool.
**Ctragesser**: Wait a second.
**Ctragesser**: How did he do that?
**Ctragesser**: And I, I just go back to that.
**Ctragesser**: And that's like so important to me.
**Ctragesser**: Like, that's what I enjoy.
**Ctragesser**: And hell, I mean, you know, Friday, when you're there, you're like, okay, still is coming.
**Ctragesser**: Boom, boom, boom.
**Ctragesser**: We took the rest of the day and we mapped everything out and we're like, okay, look, truck comes here.
**Ctragesser**: We can stage a truck over here and possibly here, so we can have three on site.
**Ctragesser**: And then where are we going to do with the other four?
**Ctragesser**: And it was okay.
**Ctragesser**: We were looking at truck stops and everything.
**Ctragesser**: And finally, I don't know if it's Ian or Andrew.
**Ctragesser**: One of them goes, what about this parking lot at Grand Park?
**Ctragesser**: And I was like, dude, that's perfect.
**Ctragesser**: It's a straight shot.
**Ctragesser**: South Forum, it's a mile away.
**Ctragesser**: So even if the truck drivers are not talking to each other and say truck number four doesn't realize, hey, there's nobody on site.
**Ctragesser**: I can go get unloaded.
**Ctragesser**: You know, Andrew or myself or Ian, we can run down there.
**Ctragesser**: Hey.
**Ctragesser**: Yep, you're next, buddy.
**Ctragesser**: Let's go.
**Ctragesser**: Yep.
**Ctragesser**: So no, that's.
**Ctragesser**: I really enjoy that.
**Ctragesser**: So.
**Ctragesser**: Yeah, forget.
**Ctragesser**: Don't.
**Ctragesser**: Don't let me forget to grab some vests and rest for one.
**Ctragesser**: Yeah, yeah.
**Ctragesser**: I'd say the biggest thing is on us is, you know, we gotta, you know, and I.
**Ctragesser**: That video is good because everybody can go back and watch it and that's things that we just have to be better about is, you know, Jesse and I recording that knowledge to send to you guys.
**Bclymer**: All right, what do you like that your manager does regular check ins and open communication channels have been instrumental in my development.
**Ctragesser**: No, not to me.
**Ctragesser**: That's all the way from Brandon.
**Ctragesser**: You, A.J.
**Ctragesser**: glenn, you know, we do our daily huddle in the mornings, but even I get my 6:30 Jesse phone call every morning.
**Ctragesser**: I mean, no, I don't need Brandon calling me every day.
**Ctragesser**: He's busy.
**Ctragesser**: I get it.
**Ctragesser**: AJ me for crate.
**Ctragesser**: And then, you know, that's about it.
**Ctragesser**: So.
**Bclymer**: Yep, I try to make sure I call.
**Bclymer**: It's a little easier now when I'm driving into work.
**Bclymer**: It's frees up me from being distracted by a million different things.
**Bclymer**: It definitely helps you talk through things, think about stuff you might not have thought about.
**Bclymer**: Where can your manager improve?
**Bclymer**: Proactive feedback loops on developmental goals would be helpful.
**Bclymer**: So what do you mean by that?
**Ctragesser**: Just, I mean, you know, I know you probably have a set of goals in your mind that you'd like to see, you know, either all your superintendents, you know, you know, achieve whether it's, you know, hey guys, look, you know, this job, it's.
**Ctragesser**: I more care about the schedule than the budget on this one or you know, what, you know, which is our driving factor.
**Ctragesser**: You know, it's very hard to bring a job in under before schedule and under budget that normally decide.
**Ctragesser**: I don't think I've ever seen it happen.
**Ctragesser**: Not to say it can't, but it's Normally, okay, you want it done beforehand, it's going to cost more money or you don't care how long it takes, you want to save money.
**Ctragesser**: So just goals like that and I'm sure, you know, I'm sure, you know, Glenn's kind of set goals for us, you know, hey guys, you know, blah, blah, like we've got our own, like few milestone dates, like, hey, you know, I really want the topping out the 25th of July, is that possible?
**Ctragesser**: And every, you know, every week.
**Ctragesser**: I don't think we, we really don't talk about every day, but every week it's, what are you thinking?
**Ctragesser**: Are we tracking or not?
**Ctragesser**: And if we are, great.
**Ctragesser**: If not, then we need to, you know, get ahead of it and we need to move the date back.
**Ctragesser**: Yeah, I would say, I mean, general rule of thumb, it's always going to be, you know, keeping our schedule now, you know, coming in under budget.
**Ctragesser**: Right.
**Ctragesser**: Like, that's just, I would say staying on budget is priority.
**Ctragesser**: Right.
**Ctragesser**: We're not going to sit here and throw shit to the overtime, you know, to bring the schedule in a month early.
**Ctragesser**: Right.
**Ctragesser**: It's hitting the schedule and everything that we can pick up is, you know, great as far as, you know, under budget, you know, these jobs should be in budget when we.
**Ctragesser**: Yeah, right.
**Ctragesser**: And so it's just, it's, it's staying on track with that and not having slippage to where then now we have to go reach into our pocket to make up time.
**Ctragesser**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I think the most important thing and I was always involved as a superintendent was going over the, you know, how I was taught, you know, estimating department and pre construction, they want a job.
**Bclymer**: They gave us the estimate and we bought the job out and we had a month to get it bought out, to establish, establish the project schedule, project budget.
**Bclymer**: What was it going to make or what was the projected profit in that job?
**Bclymer**: And everything's covered.
**Bclymer**: So my involvement in that, you know, as I developed, I could get, by the end of that month I could tell you exactly how much money we're going to make on that job.
**Bclymer**: Because I was going to keep the schedule going.
**Bclymer**: I was going to make sure the PM had all the materials on time and everything bought out.
**Bclymer**: And it works like, it works every time if you do that.
**Bclymer**: So that's, you know, you can't think of it, hey, I'm just superintendent, I want to come here and build this thing.
**Bclymer**: You know, we want superintendents that are also involved with the budget.
**Bclymer**: You know, you can, you know, if you don't drive making sure things when you need.
**Bclymer**: It's not going to do you any good to push on the schedule.
**Bclymer**: So, you know, I would look at making sure you do that and then, you know, I've never had a job that went long and was successful or did better than a job that was done quick and, and done.
**Bclymer**: Not that you have to throw a bunch of money at it.
**Bclymer**: You just coordinate everybody and make sure it runs smooth.
**Bclymer**: And then for dang sure, being mindful of all the different parts and pieces that go into a job so you're not forgetting something that's going to cause you to stumble, you know, during the job.
**Bclymer**: So, you know, making sure things are done when they're ready to hang drywall, everything's roughed in, you know, things like that.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Ctragesser**: No, I mean, perfect example of this one would be that encroachment agreement that we're finally getting done so we can get our dang water line in.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: Because if the parking lot was fine and you could have got it done before the steel showed up, you couldn't have because of that thing.
**Ctragesser**: So.
**Ctragesser**: And that.
**Ctragesser**: Yeah.
**Ctragesser**: And honestly, I've never dealt with Centerpoint before, but you know, from what United said, if this was citizens, we would have made one phone call and they would have given us the encroachment permit that same day.
**Ctragesser**: But then when we get a hold of Centerpoint, they go, oh, we have a 45 day process.
**Ctragesser**: It's kind of like, dude, this just.
**Ctragesser**: Yeah, so, but we got it.
**Ctragesser**: That's the main thing.
**Bclymer**: So where do you want to be in 5 years?
**Bclymer**: Aspire to be a senior leadership role where I can influence strategic direction and mentor emerging leaders.
**Bclymer**: Ideally contributing to new business or service lines as a lines within the company.
**Bclymer**: So, like one thing we tell everybody, like, you know, in five years, like you're a superintendent now.
**Bclymer**: You.
**Bclymer**: I want to be the best superintendent there is and I'm moving on and learning new things.
**Bclymer**: I don't know what you.
**Bclymer**: What contributing to new business or service lines.
**Bclymer**: What were you thinking with that?
**Ctragesser**: Well, just, I mean, as much as we're developing in the next few years, I mean, with all the projects we've got coming in, it's just being part of that, you know, I know Brandon's talked about other ones of these or something else.
**Ctragesser**: And it's okay, you know, continuing to grow with the company and not just, oh, no, I just want to stay in Indiana.
**Ctragesser**: No, that's not, you know, no, I, you know, I enjoy that.
**Ctragesser**: So I'm just Looking forward to seeing where this business goes for you guys.
**Ctragesser**: So you're saying, like, when you say you don't want to stay in Indiana, you talk about you want to travel?
**Ctragesser**: Oh, I don't know.
**Ctragesser**: I'm, I'm like, I told you, I'm at the age where, you know, my kids are grown, so it's like, hey, I don't have to be home to coach baseball, you know?
**Ctragesser**: Yeah.
**Ctragesser**: That's why I keep telling aj.
**Ctragesser**: I'm like, dude, your life's getting ready to be turned upside down.
**Ctragesser**: You have no idea.
**Ctragesser**: You have no idea.
**Ctragesser**: And you know where I'm at?
**Ctragesser**: The exact opposite.
**Ctragesser**: I'm like, hey, okay, I can be back Friday.
**Ctragesser**: See you.
**Ctragesser**: You know, if I'm gone a week, I'm gone a week.
**Ctragesser**: Not.
**Ctragesser**: It's jail.
**Ctragesser**: Yeah.
**Ctragesser**: I'd say the biggest thing, like, you know, when you talk about new service lines, if you're talking about like a concrete division or something along those lines, like when you think about business in general, like, I, you know, I always try to do it with here.
**Ctragesser**: Like we, we have to do stuff that separate us from the others, right?
**Ctragesser**: Like, anybody can put four walls and a roof up.
**Ctragesser**: Right?
**Ctragesser**: It's about, you know, changing like into an owner's mindset and like doing those things, like thinking ahead that other people aren't thinking of.
**Ctragesser**: Right.
**Ctragesser**: And so not only just in what we do, but any business that you think about is like, all right, how.
**Ctragesser**: What is our niche?
**Ctragesser**: What.
**Ctragesser**: What can we do that others aren't doing?
**Ctragesser**: What is the little bit of extra?
**Ctragesser**: How can we over deliver?
**Ctragesser**: Right.
**Ctragesser**: And looking for those opportunities?
**Ctragesser**: That's a, that's, you know, how I approach any business.
**Ctragesser**: Right.
**Ctragesser**: That's no different than like you were when you were talking to Andrew and Ian and I, hey, you know, ask some of these traits.
**Ctragesser**: Hey, what do other GCs do that you like?
**Ctragesser**: Yeah, what do they do that you don't like?
**Ctragesser**: You know, make sure we're not doing that.
**Ctragesser**: And if it's something that they do that they like that we look at and go, we can implement that.
**Ctragesser**: That's easy.
**Ctragesser**: Exactly.
**Ctragesser**: So.
**Ctragesser**: So it's, it's, you know, constant, never ending improvement as far as senior leadership and stuff goes.
**Ctragesser**: I mean, again, like Jesse alluded to, you know, everybody wants to be, you know, it, you know, in my and Jesse's role.
**Ctragesser**: But, you know, I can tell you right now, like, you know, when, you know, 10 years ago or 12 years ago, whatever, whenever I was working for Jesse, like my.
**Ctragesser**: If you would ask me what My five year goal was, it was to be a project manager, right?
**Ctragesser**: Or, you know, to one day be a vp, right?
**Ctragesser**: Like, but first I just wanted to be the best PM I could possibly be.
**Ctragesser**: Like, I would sit there and read the spec book.
**Ctragesser**: I, you know, teach myself pool planning, like all this stuff.
**Ctragesser**: How can I be the very best I can be, you know, at my, at my craft, you know, and so for you, right, like, you don't have to have a title to be a leader, right?
**Ctragesser**: You can be a leader now, right?
**Ctragesser**: And you lead by example, by doing the best and teaching people.
**Ctragesser**: Right?
**Ctragesser**: Like, so anything like we talk about with any of these checklists, anything like that, that, that, you know, is valuable.
**Ctragesser**: If it's valuable for you, it's probably valuable for somebody else, right?
**Ctragesser**: It's valuable for an end, it's valuable for an answer.
**Ctragesser**: And so like putting that stuff together is, is a huge help.
**Ctragesser**: And that's how you start to backfill, right, is people become more and more efficient.
**Ctragesser**: Because the more efficient you can become, then the less Jesse and I have to get involved, the more we can go out and do more and more we can say, all right, Chad's got it and we can go do other stuff.
**Ctragesser**: So.
**Bclymer**: That'S right, yeah.
**Bclymer**: Just as we grow, you think about, there's not enough time in the day to, you know, a year from now, if we got 20 superintendents, there's no way I can call 20 people each morning.
**Bclymer**: So it's not possible.
**Bclymer**: But when we got other people in the company that, you know, are kind of mentoring, you know, other new guys and stuff like that, you know, we just want to make like there's how you can step up and, you know, just make those calls on your own just to get to know people and also talk them through what they got going on.
**Bclymer**: So that's good.
**Bclymer**: The next one was how can I help you get there?
**Bclymer**: Clear goal setting conversations and cross functional exposure.
**Bclymer**: So the.
**Bclymer**: On a cross functional exposure, what are you looking for?
**Ctragesser**: Like a good example on that one is, you know, I have.
**Ctragesser**: I done sprinkler systems before.
**Ctragesser**: Yes.
**Ctragesser**: The level that you guys are doing them at in these warehouses.
**Ctragesser**: No, that's what I mean by, you know, cross functional, whatever you want to call it, you know, it's basically getting that exposure to those different, you know, how again, like Brandon just said, you know, what sets up, what sets us aside from somebody else that does the same sprinklers.
**Ctragesser**: Okay, well, clearly you guys have got something down to a science there that I've not learned and you know, just exposing myself to different things like that.
**Ctragesser**: So that goes back to the, you know, I'm happy to show you how we do it right.
**Ctragesser**: And stuff like that.
**Ctragesser**: However, I don't think you've mastered your current yet.
**Ctragesser**: Right.
**Ctragesser**: Like you have to master what's in your current realm before it's.
**Ctragesser**: I can start throwing other things on your plate.
**Ctragesser**: No, 100% agree.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And that'll help as you, this is an example for me.
**Bclymer**: I mean, I was in construction for 20 years and never did a post tension building.
**Bclymer**: And then the last two projects I did before joining Elite were both that.
**Bclymer**: So, so, and it's.
**Bclymer**: So that's just as you, you know, build different projects, like each one is going to have something new and that's, you're going to learn a lot doing that and it may come to where you need to go and run one of the sprinkler jobs that you're talking about.
**Bclymer**: And so then that's something you'd learn one of those projects.
**Bclymer**: So it's definitely going to be a lot of new and interesting things to learn as you go.
**Bclymer**: And that's the great thing is once you've learned it and someone else that's new and hasn't done one before, they can talk to you and be an extra person for advice on things to do and not do.
**Bclymer**: Last question was, what do you want to ask me that you haven't yet?
**Bclymer**: How does leadership envision the company evolving in the next three to five years and what roles do you see for current team members in that vision?
**Bclymer**: So this Brandon's the visionary here.
**Ctragesser**: I mean, as far as, you know, where, where do I see us in the next three to five years?
**Ctragesser**: You know, I mean, we'll, you know, keep, keep growing.
**Ctragesser**: We've got some big projects coming up.
**Ctragesser**: I think that we'll, we'll start really doing even more and more developments, especially on a bigger stage.
**Ctragesser**: You know, three years from now, four years from now, we should be done with Paradise Isle maybe, you know, maybe five years.
**Ctragesser**: You know, having that on our resume is huge.
**Ctragesser**: You know, not a lot of companies can do a billion dollar plus job.
**Ctragesser**: Okay.
**Ctragesser**: You know, as far as, as far as current employees and where their roles are, so obviously like, as we grow, there's more opportunity for people to rise.
**Ctragesser**: Now with the caveat, we're not gonna promote people just because they're here.
**Ctragesser**: You know, it's, it's who is, you know, who suits it best well and who goes above and beyond.
**Ctragesser**: Who's Learning who's growing.
**Ctragesser**: Right.
**Ctragesser**: Like, you know, Jesse and I think the world of Andrew, you know, for.
**Ctragesser**: For as long as he's been here and his, you know, just exposure to the construction industry, we think he's going to go very far.
**Ctragesser**: Like, he learns, like, he adapts like that.
**Ctragesser**: You know, he's very valuable.
**Ctragesser**: Like, that's why we stuck him out there, you know, with you guys, to be like, all right, like, learn, you know, thing.
**Ctragesser**: It's the same thing with you.
**Ctragesser**: Like, you know, you.
**Ctragesser**: If you can keep learning and adapting, you know, you can definitely, you know, grow up into more of a general super, you know, kind of an operation standpoint.
**Ctragesser**: Like we talk about, Jesse and I, like, as we keep growing, especially as we get, you know, you know, as we open up our next office, you know, and whatnot, like, we can't go to every single job.
**Ctragesser**: We don't, you know, we don't get to them now.
**Ctragesser**: And so we have to have somebody who has knowledge like we do to be able to go in.
**Ctragesser**: And just like, when I go to the site right now, have we thought about this?
**Ctragesser**: Like this?
**Ctragesser**: But how do we do this?
**Ctragesser**: All right, here, let me show you how to do this.
**Ctragesser**: Like, all that kind of knowledge, like, that's, you know, somebody we're going to be needing and we'll either promote from within or we'll get it from outside help.
**Ctragesser**: But yeah, there's definitely more opportunity roles that.
**Ctragesser**: That come with that.
**Bclymer**: That's right.
**Bclymer**: And like, you know, we both been around myself and Brandon, you know, in companies where, you know, there's people that they get to that role, but they, you know, they know the company policy better than they know, like, actual, you know, there's people out in the field that's got years more of experience, but they know what the, you know, what is the company's policies, what are the people supposed to be doing.
**Bclymer**: And so that's the thing.
**Bclymer**: If you become the expert in how we do things and you consistently show that you're doing things the way we want them done, then those are the type of people we want.
**Bclymer**: You know, if we don't have time to check on a job, we want to send someone there that we know knows how we want things run and what people are supposed to be doing.
**Bclymer**: So, you know, that's definitely that we're looking for those people, identifying them, and as we grow that we can, they're the ones that are going to get promoted to those positions.
**Ctragesser**: Any other questions?
**Ctragesser**: I'm good.
**Ctragesser**: Jesse, got anything else?
**Bclymer**: No, I Don't think so.
**Bclymer**: Just keep knocking it out of the park.
**Bclymer**: And I looked at the weather app today.
**Bclymer**: It's got like thunderstorm chances.
**Ctragesser**: Slab the pad.
**Ctragesser**: Yeah, it's actually not bad.
**Ctragesser**: I said with all this heat, as soon as it dries, it goes great.
**Ctragesser**: But you know, a quarter inch of rain won't hurt us.
**Ctragesser**: But when we're getting those inches.
**Ctragesser**: Well, maybe.
**Ctragesser**: But like right now it's been.
**Ctragesser**: Oh, yeah, we can.
**Ctragesser**: Great.
**Ctragesser**: No, it's.
**Ctragesser**: I mean, it's solid.
**Ctragesser**: Solid gets right now.
**Ctragesser**: That's awesome.
**Bclymer**: That is awesome.
**Ctragesser**: Yeah.
**Ctragesser**: So we've got, like I said, steel still showing up.
**Ctragesser**: We got concrete guys rolling.
**Ctragesser**: We got United's out there.
**Ctragesser**: So it's going to be a busy week out there.
**Ctragesser**: So lots of moving pieces and so.
**Bclymer**: When is the topping out party?
**Ctragesser**: Right now it's slated for July 25th.
**Ctragesser**: Nice.
**Bclymer**: I'll be out there.
**Ctragesser**: You know, that's again us planning and thinking that it's 75 and sunny every day, no rain.
**Bclymer**: So yeah, I'll be there the week of the 7th, so.
**Ctragesser**: Of July.
**Bclymer**: Look forward to.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, look forward to seeing that building going up.
**Ctragesser**: Nope.
**Ctragesser**: I'm excited to see it get out of the ground and get going vertical.
**Ctragesser**: So.
**Bclymer**: Good topping out parties.
**Bclymer**: Who you have in cater it?
**Ctragesser**: Probably get Twin Peaks girls.
**Bclymer**: That's right.
**Bclymer**: I had Hooters catered.
**Bclymer**: A couple of mine paid for the girls to come all dressed up, serve the food.
**Ctragesser**: All right, well, you guys don't mind, I'm gonna hop off here and head back to the job site.
**Ctragesser**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: All right, Good deal.
