## Transcript
**Aelkarrimy**: Sam.
**Bclymer**: What up, Ahmed?
**Jdawson**: You sleeping better these days?
**Kevin.ly**: Much better, I must say.
**Bclymer**: We.
**Jdawson**: One of our project executives here, he just had a baby like two or three weeks ago now, and he's like, gosh, I'm so tired.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Kevin.ly**: I was so lucky.
**Kevin.ly**: My company basically allowed me to work from home the first few months, which was phenomenal.
**Kevin.ly**: So then I was able to juggle both.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Kevin.ly**: So he was okay, but definitely no sleep.
**Kevin.ly**: That was definitely a thing that was happening.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I mean, it's.
**Jdawson**: He's been kind of bouncing back forth, which his wife doesn't work, which is fortunate.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Kevin.ly**: Hey, Ted, can you hear me by any chance?
**Mparsons**: Now I can.
**Kevin.ly**: Hey, Ted, so I have a quick question for you.
**Kevin.ly**: I requested this from Yusuke, but I know he's going to need some help to gather these specifications.
**Kevin.ly**: We have an RFI that's open.
**Kevin.ly**: Basically the RFI is asking what are the finish.
**Kevin.ly**: The current existing finishes in the restroom versus outside of the restroom.
**Kevin.ly**: Because they just infilled the trenches.
**Kevin.ly**: So they just need to match those specifications.
**Kevin.ly**: So if we can just get the GC the those finishes, they can then continue and finish closing up the slab and.
**Kevin.ly**: Okay, whenever you can get that.
**Kevin.ly**: That would be great because I know that they just finished infilling last week.
**Kevin.ly**: So the sooner the better.
**Mparsons**: Okay, I'll go down and take a look and then I'll see if I can work it out with them and see what they want to do.
**Kevin.ly**: Thank you.
**Bclymer**: S.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Ahmed, are we.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Are we good to start or.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: We're waiting for.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I don't see anyone from Brian's team.
**Kevin.ly**: I do not see Brian on this call.
**Bclymer**: Let me text him really quick.
**Bclymer**: But.
**Kevin.ly**: They might be just stuck on a call and he might join in a little bit later.
**Kevin.ly**: I just texted him.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: He is here.
**Kevin.ly**: Brian, disregard my text.
**Kevin.ly**: Don't worry about it.
**Aelkarrimy**: Sorry.
**Aelkarrimy**: I've got a 4 o' clock that.
**Kevin.ly**: Usually runs long, so I literally just said that.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Do you know if Yusuke is joining?
**Kevin.ly**: Yusuke is on the call.
**Kevin.ly**: Yusuke, is Yukita joining this call or we can get started?
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, I think we can get started.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Mike, you want to get us started with this safe stuff?
**Bschwartz**: Yeah.
**Bschwartz**: So on site, we've still had electrical on site.
**Bschwartz**: They're continuing their feeder pools from the HE1 panel.
**Bschwartz**: Thanks to Ted, we were able to get access into the sublease space with our lift.
**Bschwartz**: And we ran those cables over.
**Bschwartz**: Tomorrow we'll be installing the panel on the other side of that fence.
**Bschwartz**: And they.
**Bschwartz**: The electrical team and exotech received material on site today.
**Bschwartz**: And then we have plumbers, they're concluding the back pour this week.
**Bschwartz**: And then we are scheduled to have the fire sprinkler team on site on Monday, but that is pending the hydraulic calcs.
**Bschwartz**: So I'm sure we'll get to talk about that.
**Bschwartz**: But that's all I have for on site right now, if anybody has any questions.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah, that's.
**Jdawson**: Anyway, so then I told Joe.
**Jdawson**: Oh, hey Joe, sorry about that.
**Cheryl.green**: What's going on?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: All right, so we'll get to the open chain orders.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: We still have the transformer chain orders.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Hopefully we can get a decision on that today.
**Bclymer**: Kevin.
**Cheryl.green**: Sorry.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: The insurance change order, at this point we have already billed for it.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So we just waited for official approval and payment.
**Jdawson**: Kevin, is Kevin on this call?
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: Your insurance lady was asking why in the world we were doing all this, just so you know.
**Jdawson**: Yes, I talked with her and she got an contact with your broker to kind of go over the coverage.
**Jdawson**: So based on her reading of it.
**Bclymer**: Just her wanted to be informed.
**Jdawson**: She's saying the insurance coverage is more than we need.
**Jdawson**: She's checking with my legal to reword the contract.
**Jdawson**: So it's clear on exactly what coverage is required.
**Jdawson**: I mean, it's definitely more than you need.
**Jdawson**: That was the whole comment that I said from the get go.
**Jdawson**: But per the, you know, that's what we.
**Jdawson**: The whole sticking point was in the contract negotiation that, well, you know, we need to ensure this for three additional years, you know, after the project is done, which is I've never seen done before, but that was what was asked for.
**Jdawson**: And that's the insurance coverage I got.
**Jdawson**: Now, I already paid for that.
**Jdawson**: And if that's going to be an issue, then we're going to have to have a sidebar conversation.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And we also have this upcoming change order for the sprinkler additions.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: We are working on getting pricing together.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I know, Ahmed, you were asking for an ROM.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So we are thinking maybe a budget of 250 grand.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: We'll get final numbers once we get actual drawings and we able to estimate exactly how much material we will need and the labor as well.
**Jdawson**: I'll be able to get your number before that.
**Jdawson**: Like I, you know, I'm essentially just drawing it out my own.
**Jdawson**: Unless Henderson's going to give me a set of drawings tomorrow, which I doubt is going to happen.
**Kevin.ly**: You should be getting elevations I believe within either tomorrow or the day after that.
**Kevin.ly**: That shows you the levels from Henderson.
**Kevin.ly**: But I, but I don't think we'll be able to produce drawings for you.
**Kevin.ly**: But again, when it comes to this change in the carton director, whether we go with the 400 series or the 500 series, we still need a 4, 3.
**Kevin.ly**: And it's basically just copying whatever you have on the third row for those two additional sites.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I, trust me, I understand the concept of it, but I'm also, you know, I don't.
**Jdawson**: You know, we've done quite a few of these and it isn't just like, oh, at another level.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: There's a little bit more to it than that.
**Jdawson**: And so, you know, I, I'm doing the calcs to make sure that it's correct.
**Jdawson**: I'm not just going to throw a number out there and say, oh yeah, it's good.
**Jdawson**: Like, because this is not a normal install now.
**Jdawson**: It's, it's again, we're changing elevations like messes with your labor efficiency numbers.
**Jdawson**: But you know, I, I pretty much got a ballpark for what it is.
**Jdawson**: I'm just waiting on some updated, you know, head pricing.
**Jdawson**: You know, I, I did a quick takeoff on my labor, so I'm, I'll probably be pretty close on that.
**Jdawson**: But yeah, I mean you're going to be, you know, 180 on the low, you know, and I think, you know, I told Keba, 250 is it's not going to go over that.
**Jdawson**: So that's your range and I'll be able to have something by Monday for.
**Bclymer**: Sure.
**Cheryl.green**: For the design.
**Cheryl.green**: Let's design it towards the 500.
**Cheryl.green**: 500.
**Cheryl.green**: That's what we're moving forward with.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And Brian, are you guys able to get us some final numbers?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Maybe tomorrow or latest Monday, sorry, Friday morning.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Because we are on schedule right now to have the installer start putting up the pipes, the main pipes on Monday.
**Aelkarrimy**: Numbers in terms of.
**Jdawson**: He just needs to make, make sure the calc is good for the 4 inch.
**Aelkarrimy**: So we can, we can try to run get that calc by Friday.
**Aelkarrimy**: It's going to be tough because we have to go back and add that entire new system in and have to update everything else for those the latest comments that we got from Hugo.
**Aelkarrimy**: So there's quite a bit of work to get done there on our end to finalize those calcs and rerun them.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: So Yuzuki, decision time.
**Jdawson**: All right, here's your risk.
**Jdawson**: So we're right now we've got pipe on site.
**Jdawson**: We're installing it per the plans that we're building off of right now.
**Jdawson**: What Brian is saying is that they will not have the hydraulic calculations, meaning that's what's going to tell us how big the pipe has to be to feed the system until maybe Friday.
**Jdawson**: These guys are going to be installing this mike tomorrow, correct?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: They are starting on Monday.
**Jdawson**: Monday, okay.
**Jdawson**: So yeah, come Monday, these guys are going to be installing it.
**Jdawson**: So do you want us to plan accordingly to, to keep, keep everything online to install Monday or do you want us to pull them off and wait on confirmation?
**Jdawson**: Because I can't call the guy and at 5:30 on Friday night and say, hey, never mind.
**Jdawson**: Like that's, that's a real dick move.
**Kevin.ly**: Now your risk, okay, so what the.
**Jdawson**: Risk is that we install it and you know, start installing it and then it's the wrong size and we got to up the pipe and then we got to take it down and install a new pipe.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bryan.wagar**: The installing the pipe with the original.
**Bryan.wagar**: If it stopped at work, does it affect you the critical paths?
**Bryan.wagar**: No.
**Bclymer**: Right?
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: This sprinkler.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, Right.
**Jdawson**: Now the sprinkler goes straight in all the way through like.
**Jdawson**: So we are, you know, if we, if we stop and you know, or if it's wrong, I mean, you're going, you're going to have some effects on your schedule.
**Bclymer**: Right?
**Bryan.wagar**: Oh no.
**Bryan.wagar**: I mean, may feed her to close to Skypod rack.
**Bclymer**: Say, say that again.
**Jdawson**: You broke up there.
**Bryan.wagar**: Is it the sprinkler from main feeder 2 closer to Skype outreach, Right?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: We're talking about the bulk piping which is the main line.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bschwartz**: On the, on the schedule it says fire sprinkler and then main feeds in parentheses.
**Bryan.wagar**: And we don't have any like schedule buffers.
**Jdawson**: Schedule buffers.
**Jdawson**: If I had a task in there that said schedule buffer whenever we went to contract, would you let that fly or would you tell me to give you the best schedul can get you?
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay, so Brian, how, how, how, how do you think the correlation goes that we can use original size of the pipe or we have to use another pipe?
**Bryan.wagar**: Like what do you feel?
**Kevin.ly**: Brian, Brian, let me jump in here.
**Kevin.ly**: You see, basically from what, what Brandon's saying, you're taking a risk by saying let's keep going with the four inch pipes.
**Kevin.ly**: Henderson needs until Monday the latest to do the hydraulic calcs again.
**Kevin.ly**: And just to check out that 500 system with the entire.
**Kevin.ly**: So if we do that and we come back on Monday and all of a sudden we need a 6 inch pipe, all of those items that they're installing starting tomorrow have to be demolished and brought back down and then we need to buy new pipes for, for this, for this new run.
**Kevin.ly**: And then Brandon, are we even able to return these 4 inch lines if we were to bring them back down?
**Jdawson**: I mean return them.
**Jdawson**: I mean you have some restocking fees and stuff.
**Jdawson**: It's not fabricated.
**Jdawson**: So theoretically yes you could.
**Jdawson**: But I don't know what that restocking fee and everything looks like.
**Jdawson**: But yes, theoretically you could.
**Kevin.ly**: And if we were to push our timeline by three days where we give you a finalized response by Monday the latest, what are we looking at here?
**Kevin.ly**: We're just losing a few days.
**Daisuke.mine**: When a guy schedules his crew and he's going to be out there next week for two weeks and you pull them off, he can send them to another job and you may not even get them guys back for a couple weeks.
**Jdawson**: You're, you're a, you're at very least a three day loss.
**Jdawson**: I would say, you know, you know we probably would at the, at the latest we could probably start the following week.
**Jdawson**: You know, I mean I, I talk to him and see what he's got.
**Jdawson**: But it may be a lighter crew.
**Jdawson**: We could probably get a couple guys.
**Jdawson**: But I mean, yeah, there would be some to Jesse's point, like you know, to sit there and have a schedule that we can, you know, tell them hey never mind, go somewhere else.
**Jdawson**: I mean we, we can't really say wait now come back.
**Jdawson**: Like that's not how scheduling works.
**Jdawson**: So you know, basically you're at very least a week to two lost time.
**Bclymer**: Is it okay?
**Kevin.ly**: You're not asking.
**Bryan.wagar**: Let me share my screen.
**Bryan.wagar**: Can you see it?
**Bclymer**: Y.
**Bryan.wagar**: As I see the schedule, the number 22 fire sprinkler main fees.
**Bryan.wagar**: It is shown in blue, blue blue line.
**Bryan.wagar**: And we have some kind of little bit of space before going to the going into the work for critical mass which is sprinkler being detailing here.
**Kevin.ly**: The main feed, you got to look at the main feeds.
**Kevin.ly**: Fire sprinkler main feed, it's blue up top and it starts September 22nd.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: This one, right?
**Daisuke.mine**: And the rack, the racking starts which one is like it has to be done for the racking activity below in line 29.
**Daisuke.mine**: Like that's why the sprinkler needs to start and get ahead of that.
**Bclymer**: Oh okay.
**Kevin.ly**: 825.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bryan.wagar**: Fire sprinkler is kind of different work, right?
**Bryan.wagar**: We don't have to finish before starting the rack install for main feeder, isn't it?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So we, we had a meeting with, with Joe before we we put these dates together.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So the, our installer Needs this time ahead of the files.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Sorry, the.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: The racking.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: That's why we have it this way.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So we need that time before the racking starts to put the main pipes in.
**Kevin.ly**: Right.
**Bschwartz**: And we'll start with plan B, since that's the first racking going up.
**Bryan.wagar**: So it means we have to finish this main phase before starting the rack install.
**Bclymer**: B. Yeah, I mean, it gets.
**Jdawson**: You're tripping over each other, getting each other away.
**Jdawson**: It's.
**Jdawson**: It gets very messy.
**Jdawson**: If not.
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay, so this have to be finished before this red line.
**Bryan.wagar**: So it means this is not correct.
**Jdawson**: I mean, I can.
**Jdawson**: I can get into the inner workings of how logic and scheduling work on a Gantt chart, which is what you're looking at.
**Jdawson**: So not correct is not something I would say.
**Jdawson**: But you know, I guess in the imaging, what you're looking at is why is this not red?
**Jdawson**: And it has to do with float on a schedule and the way that works.
**Jdawson**: But concurrently, we would say that that probably should have had some lag, some negative lag on it to represent that racking time.
**Jdawson**: So I mean, we can change it to create it red.
**Jdawson**: But initially when we created this, that logic was not connected there.
**Bclymer**: Oh, no, no.
**Kevin.ly**: I need to finish it now.
**Kevin.ly**: Brian, like percentage wise, off the top.
**Aelkarrimy**: Of your head, just.
**Jdawson**: Are you.
**Kevin.ly**: Do you think it might trigger the need to upsize this pipe?
**Aelkarrimy**: You're gonna.
**Aelkarrimy**: You're gonna ask me to put a confidence number to the amount of confidence that we have here, throwing me under the bus.
**Kevin.ly**: I don't mean it like that at all.
**Kevin.ly**: But Yusuke, I honestly think that we should.
**Kevin.ly**: If we don't have a decision, we shouldn't be installing these items and we should push the schedule and everything should be included within that change order for Fire Sprinkler as it's relative to it.
**Kevin.ly**: But we need to make.
**Kevin.ly**: We need to be able to wait for the engineers to do the proper calculations to not take such a risk.
**Kevin.ly**: That could potentially cost more to demo and rebuild all of this stuff again.
**Kevin.ly**: Plus, losing some money on restocking fee for these pipes is just going to be outrageous.
**Bclymer**: That.
**Jdawson**: That restocking fee thing, if we take.
**Kevin.ly**: It's still up in the air.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jdawson**: Well, I mean, I'm saying the pipes on site, so if we got to take it back, you're going to hit that no matter what, whether it's in the air or not.
**Kevin.ly**: Oh, so it's happening.
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah.
**Kevin.ly**: So like you're losing money at the same time you suke here.
**Kevin.ly**: So if I think the risk to push the schedule by a week or two just so we can make sure we have an ironed out timeline.
**Kevin.ly**: And then Brandon, all I'm going to ask is if you can speak to the sub and just let him know that, you know, we're about a week out from actually starting up this scope and seeing if he still will be able to mobilize.
**Kevin.ly**: Not this Monday, but like the following.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I mean, we'll obviously do everything we can to, to pick it up.
**Jdawson**: But yes, I mean, I mean, Joe.
**Daisuke.mine**: You were already scrambling with, or not scrambling, you were compressing your schedule for the rack and all.
**Daisuke.mine**: Like now if that's another week later, like where does that put the end of your rack?
**Cheryl.green**: Trying to think about it.
**Cheryl.green**: I'd have to converge with, with my team.
**Cheryl.green**: I don't think it's going to, I don't think another week it'll probably be, even to be honest, at this point, it'll probably be a week and a week.
**Cheryl.green**: I want to say that we wouldn't, we'd still be able to make it up working on the weekends, but I'd have to talk to them.
**Cheryl.green**: I mean, are we talking that we're going to ask for another week or originally we said three days to see if the contractor is even willing to say, hey, you can come three days later.
**Cheryl.green**: Is that not an option to see if that's a possibility?
**Jdawson**: Well, I mean, it's.
**Jdawson**: Obviously it's an option, but if we're going to sit here and talk right now, we have to be conservative in what we're doing saying, well, I, I.
**Cheryl.green**: Get we, we know it's probably going to be a week, but we can still ask for three days and then on the end of Friday you'll know.
**Cheryl.green**: I mean, if we have to change the pipe site size, I mean, it's gonna be a lot different, right?
**Jdawson**: To be honest.
**Jdawson**: And, and Brian, I mean again, I'll, I'll say this, but I don't think that we're gonna have to change the pipe size because you're still calculating off the same amount remote heads.
**Jdawson**: But again, I'm not the engineer of record, but that would be my opinion.
**Aelkarrimy**: That is our interpretation as well.
**Aelkarrimy**: We're leaning towards it not having to have a pipe size change.
**Aelkarrimy**: But again, we don't want to say for sure one way or the other in case we do have to upsize that pipe and it's.
**Jdawson**: And, and correct me if I'm wrong with the couch that I'm seeing, you know, I would not expect in any world that we would up the entire four inch to a six.
**Jdawson**: We might come over and put two or three sticks at most of six and reduce to a four.
**Mparsons**: Would you agree?
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah, I'd have to check with Luther on that, but I don't think it'd be the entire run that would be up.
**Aelkarrimy**: Up sized to six inch.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So again, Yuzuka, your call.
**Jdawson**: I don't know how important schedule is to you, but if it were me, you know, I would.
**Jdawson**: I would make the move.
**Jdawson**: But again, I don't know.
**Jdawson**: I mean, maybe, maybe.
**Jdawson**: Maybe the risk of the money is more important than finishing, you know, on time.
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay.
**Bryan.wagar**: I'm not sure like how the.
**Bryan.wagar**: You said if we.
**Bryan.wagar**: If you postpone three days, it's not possible, but it will post one, like week or two.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So if you're looking for me to tell you something right now how far this is going to push out, I'm going to tell you two weeks.
**Jdawson**: It's going to take us two weeks to get him back rescheduled.
**Jdawson**: So if you're making a decision, make it off of that.
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay.
**Bryan.wagar**: Still, I'm not getting that main feeds work will affect Iraq installation.
**Jdawson**: Totally understand.
**Kevin.ly**: The main feeds need to be run, Yusuke.
**Kevin.ly**: So then they can now say, all right, there won't be any clashes with the racks positioning, and they can continue proceeding with the installation as is.
**Bryan.wagar**: So that's why the work is because of above the rack install area.
**Kevin.ly**: That too.
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah.
**Kevin.ly**: Well, it comes to the sides of the racks, but yes, the overhead needs to be completed, so then they can continue running course when it comes to the racking.
**Jdawson**: So the racks being erected, it comes across and then it's right in the front, it hangs over, and then we put our verticals down and.
**Jdawson**: And then branch lines in.
**Jdawson**: Trust me, Yuzuki, if I didn't think that it was an issue at all, I don't want to have this conversation.
**Jdawson**: I would just be like, yeah, no big deal, we'll move it around.
**Jdawson**: But there is a reason that we install it a certain way and how it works.
**Jdawson**: I'm happy to go through it with you and I can go on site and show you how this stuff works.
**Jdawson**: But I've also been doing this well over a decade.
**Jdawson**: I mean, trust me, we're right.
**Aelkarrimy**: Joe, are you guys building those racks on the floor and then standing them up in one piece?
**Cheryl.green**: Yes.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah.
**Aelkarrimy**: So Yasuke, they can't have the fire suppression team out there trying to install the main feed while they're trying to stand up these huge racks because they're just they're going to get in each other's way and it's a safe.
**Aelkarrimy**: It's, it's, it's safety.
**Aelkarrimy**: You can't have someone up above trying to hang pipe while someone's down below trying to put together racks.
**Bclymer**: It's.
**Aelkarrimy**: It's too many people in this, too many cooks in the kitchen.
**Cheryl.green**: When we stand these up, there is like a, there is a clearance that nobody's allowed to work in just in case something does fall.
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay, okay, okay.
**Jdawson**: Yuzuki, let me ask you this.
**Jdawson**: What is 2 weeks delay worth to your company?
**Bryan.wagar**: 2 weeks delay might affected Iraq installation delay.
**Bclymer**: Right?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: What I mean is like if this thing opens two weeks later than what you have, how much money does that cost your company and potential profit and revenue?
**Bryan.wagar**: Actually, we cannot accept the golog delay.
**Jdawson**: Well, I can tell you right now that just because you can't accept it, then I would say you have to take the risk.
**Jdawson**: But at like there is no world that we live in that like things are changed and it's going to be a delay and then we just say, oh, don't worry, we'll date no matter what.
**Jdawson**: Like, that's not what we agreed to.
**Jdawson**: If things change and you say, well, okay, let's make the change, then your dates will push.
**Jdawson**: Now if you don't want to change anything, then you don't have to worry about it.
**Kevin.ly**: I mean, Yasuke, the more I'm hearing this, like from Brandon to even Brian's vague response about the 4 inch line potentially being upgraded, even if we wait till Monday, if, let's say they proceed with the 4 inch line, we're only hearing that segments of the 4 inch line will need to be upsized to 6 inches versus pushing the entire schedule will have a bigger change order than you proceeding with 4 inches with the understanding that if Monday comes and Henderson says, hey, we need to upsize part of this pipe to 6 inch, it'll be a minor change order in comparison to a major change order.
**Kevin.ly**: But we need to hear you as the client, really be the one that says, I get it.
**Kevin.ly**: I understand.
**Kevin.ly**: This is the approach, I think taking a smaller, potentially a smaller change order or maybe no change order.
**Kevin.ly**: Better than nothing.
**Bryan.wagar**: Okay, so let's go forward.
**Bryan.wagar**: Let's don't stop it then.
**Kevin.ly**: And don't worry you Sig.
**Kevin.ly**: I'm gonna pray a lot over the weekend to ensure that we stick to the 4 inch line.
**Kevin.ly**: Hopefully my prayers are met.
**Cheryl.green**: I'm just gonna call Brandon non stop on Friday night.
**Jdawson**: Just, it's like Every normal Friday night.
**Jdawson**: All right, so Mike, how about you got your marching orders?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: All right, so now on the Transformers, Joe, what do you guys.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: What have you guys.
**Cheryl.green**: All right, we have something to present.
**Cheryl.green**: Final numbers will come tomorrow afternoon.
**Cheryl.green**: But we want to show you what we have right now.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay.
**Cheryl.green**: We just.
**Cheryl.green**: We just have to check the amperage on one piece of machinery.
**Cheryl.green**: It's one piece of machinery, but it's in four locations.
**Cheryl.green**: And they're getting those final numbers to us so that we can make sure we have it completely accurate.
**Cheryl.green**: But I know I wanted to get this in front of Brian to make sure with what we have currently, if that changes anything.
**Cheryl.green**: We don't think it will, but of course we want it.
**Cheryl.green**: We want you to see it.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Cody.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Erinm**: I'm sharing my screen now.
**Erinm**: So like Joe said, this isn't 100% vinyl.
**Erinm**: I'm hoping to get this finalized before lunch tomorrow.
**Erinm**: But this is currently the numbers that we are looking at.
**Erinm**: As we've discussed in the past, our Skypod power boxes should not have changed everything else.
**Erinm**: There has been some small changes.
**Erinm**: I think the last time we talked about calculations, we said that the inbound conveying system, we knew what it was going to be, but we had to rerun those voltages from going from 400 to 480.
**Erinm**: And then we said that all of the outbound was completely up in the air.
**Erinm**: And this is what we are currently looking at.
**Erinm**: So unless we find anything major throughout tonight and then tomorrow morning, you should be seeing values very similar to this.
**Erinm**: Tomorrow when we officially send it over.
**Cheryl.green**: Can you show a side by side or over under with the last thing that we sent to them?
**Erinm**: I don't know how well I'll be able to do that, but let me see.
**Cheryl.green**: Just post the picture into the.
**Erinm**: Oh, I can do that too, actually.
**Erinm**: Okay, yeah, I'll send a picture in the chat and I'll leave this one on the screen for everybody to see.
**Bclymer**: Foreign.
**Erinm**: So yes, the old one that was last confirmed on.
**Erinm**: I believe it was end of June I just sent into the chat.
**Erinm**: So you guys can compare what's in the chat versus what is on my screen to see the differences that have happened.
**Cheryl.green**: Brian, do you see anything that.
**Bclymer**: Stands out?
**Bclymer**: It.
**Aelkarrimy**: I mean, quick glance.
**Aelkarrimy**: Not really.
**Aelkarrimy**: The CSO1 and the CSO3 went up by about 12 KVA, but the other two went back down by about.
**Aelkarrimy**: I don't know, what is that, 10 KVA?
**Aelkarrimy**: I'll really have to take a closer look at these numbers and compare them to what we've what we've got designed currently to see how that's going to impact feeders and branch and circuit breakers.
**Erinm**: Yeah and we noticed that change too.
**Erinm**: We kind of have an Explanation on the CSO1 and CSO3.
**Erinm**: One of the machineries that we were looking at was misspec so we actually just got those new numbers pretty recently.
**Erinm**: So that's why those KVAs went up.
**Erinm**: But like I said, since I'm not planning on sending this out until before I go on lunch tomorrow, I'm going to double check all those numbers and make sure that you know we didn't maybe over spec or anything like that.
**Erinm**: So 100% get that clarified.
**Aelkarrimy**: Sorry, I'm trying to.
**Aelkarrimy**: I'm trying to pull stuff up so I can at least you're okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: Run some.
**Aelkarrimy**: Some quick numbers while we're here.
**Cheryl.green**: Just want to make sure that doesn't this.
**Cheryl.green**: We want to make sure everything we have planned for the change order doesn't need to be changed.
**Daisuke.mine**: Is this, this is all related to those direct feeds into your equipment?
**Cheryl.green**: The 480 feeds?
**Erinm**: Yeah.
**Erinm**: So these, these 481s would be direct feeds to the equipment while these 400 volts would end up having the transformers that we have talked about keeping already.
**Daisuke.mine**: Okay, so the transformers we do have currently are still fine, correct?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Erinm**: Those values have not changed.
**Erinm**: So what we confirmed I believe a month ago, those values are all still the same.
**Erinm**: The only ones that have changed would be any of these CS ones.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Do we already have the breakers for those?
**Daisuke.mine**: No, that's part of the change is the alternate breaker sizes.
**Jdawson**: Ryan, do you have the space for that?
**Aelkarrimy**: I mean from a capacity standpoint you mean?
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah, yeah.
**Aelkarrimy**: I'm not.
**Aelkarrimy**: Honestly I'm not worried about the capacity of the.
**Aelkarrimy**: Of the main panel that we had at the back.
**Aelkarrimy**: We had.
**Aelkarrimy**: We had plenty of spare in there from the original design.
**Aelkarrimy**: The biggest issue was because we had individual step down transformers from 40 to 400 volt.
**Aelkarrimy**: That's really where we started running into issues when these loads increased so much.
**Aelkarrimy**: Cody, do you have that markup of where.
**Aelkarrimy**: Where each of these was compared to what our transformer naming convention was?
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah, I'm talking about.
**Erinm**: Yeah, it's.
**Erinm**: I'd have to find that in our email chain but that should be pretty easy for me to find.
**Erinm**: Just give me a sec.
**Erinm**: You wanted the markups in terms of what transformers with what?
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah.
**Aelkarrimy**: Which of our transformers aligns with which of your drops Just like in.
**Aelkarrimy**: Look at circuit breaker sizes and work.
**Aelkarrimy**: My work.
**Aelkarrimy**: My Way back from there.
**Erinm**: Yeah, Give me.
**Erinm**: Give me one second to find that.
**Jdawson**: Do.
**Jdawson**: Do you want to send that over?
**Jdawson**: And, Brian, you can review it so we're not just patiently waiting on you and judging every calculation that you make.
**Aelkarrimy**: I mean, that's up to you guys.
**Aelkarrimy**: If you want to try and put me on the spot, I can handle the pressure if you're willing to sit and wait.
**Jdawson**: Otherwise, I can go ahead and send that over to him, and then, Kevin, let's keep moving on to try to get through everything and respect everybody's time here.
**Aelkarrimy**: Oh, yeah.
**Aelkarrimy**: If you guys have other stuff to talk about, go for it.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay, so the next thing would be the RFI on the concrete finish.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I know, Ahmed, you talked about it earlier.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So if we can get that information so we can finish that.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: The concrete patch.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah.
**Kevin.ly**: Hopefully Ted is able to find something in his records.
**Kevin.ly**: And if not, Yasuke, if you have that information, the sooner the better.
**Bclymer**: Again.
**Bryan.wagar**: I'm sorry, what information you're talking.
**Kevin.ly**: About the concrete that we discussed.
**Kevin.ly**: The bathroom versus the hallway.
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah, we just need that finish.
**Kevin.ly**: So then.
**Kevin.ly**: So then they can match.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Mparsons**: I'll send you a picture tomorrow of the two floor differences.
**Mparsons**: I think the warehouse floor is just made to regular warehouse floor, and the inside the room, they are probably just painted like it was, but I'll send you pictures.
**Jdawson**: Just so you guys know, that concrete is going to be different in the warehouse, because when you pour concrete at two different times like that, it will never look the same.
**Mparsons**: Yeah, it's understood.
**Kevin.ly**: I had a client who fought me on that before.
**Kevin.ly**: It was.
**Bclymer**: It was.
**Kevin.ly**: I couldn't.
**Kevin.ly**: I couldn't explain it.
**Kevin.ly**: But the saw cuts definitely keep.
**Bclymer**: Keep that line.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: I think that's it for now, unless someone has anything to add.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Oh, by the way, Ahmed, you were supposed to send us some.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Some paperwork from last week.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: You're muted.
**Bclymer**: Which paperwork was it?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: This is for our quality check.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: And what are the special inspections?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yeah.
**Kevin.ly**: Oh, special inspections.
**Kevin.ly**: Got it, Got it.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah, I will.
**Jdawson**: Who'd you end up going with?
**Kevin.ly**: Crosscheck.
**Kevin.ly**: Yeah, they were able to negotiate and bring down their proposal to a good number.
**Kevin.ly**: So they were.
**Daisuke.mine**: They were relatively good.
**Kevin.ly**: I'll try to set up an email chain with Christopher Monferrado from there.
**Kevin.ly**: He'll probably ask you for some information to sketch wool and whatnot.
**Kevin.ly**: And then, like, just giving him an anticipation of when do we plan on doing any of the anchor bolts?
**Kevin.ly**: Or if you want to call out any of the overhead inspections, you can totally do.
**Jdawson**: So what.
**Jdawson**: How many inspections do you have in your agreement amid.
**Kevin.ly**: Let's see.
**Kevin.ly**: I will preface that we let them know that we do not want them to come in every single time there's a periodic inspection.
**Kevin.ly**: So the goal is once you guys are done with one row, they'll come back, they'll come in, inspect that first row and tell you this looks good.
**Kevin.ly**: Keep running the same course with this approach.
**Kevin.ly**: And then at the end of the project, they'll come in and they'll come in and, and do the full inspection.
**Jdawson**: One shot.
**Bclymer**: Sustainable.
**Jdawson**: So you, you probably want to have them do an anchor bolt and because they're going to come in and test the tensile strength on those anchor bolts, or I mean those, you probably want to do that for B when it's done.
**Jdawson**: And then again for A, you probably don't want to wait all the way until A is done for them to check B. Oh, of course not.
**Kevin.ly**: So, so again they're going to come in once you guys have one row done on Skypod B, they'll tell you that this way of anchoring the post installed anchors is fine as long as you proceed with all of them.
**Kevin.ly**: Once you're done with B, they can come in and inspect all of that.
**Kevin.ly**: But we only have four.
**Kevin.ly**: We only have four visits total.
**Kevin.ly**: So we try to.
**Jdawson**: Two and two.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, two and two.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, exactly.
**Jdawson**: So Mike, so do yourself a favor, you know, get with Joe's team, right?
**Jdawson**: And so, you know, you want to go ahead and preemptively put that on your, your calendar and your schedule, set of reminders, put it on the schedule, whatever, to go ahead and preemptively have that.
**Jdawson**: So like, you know, the first row or really the second row, you know, once, once they start on that second row, Joe's team does, is when you, you probably want to have them come out there because they're going to look at the first one that's done and then they're going to actively look at them installing the second because they're going to have to see those holes and measure the depth and all that crap.
**Jdawson**: Gotcha.
**Jdawson**: And then of course, at the end, you know, you'll just schedule it as we're, as they're.
**Jdawson**: As they're finishing and then the next section.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Okay, so once we receive these final decisions on the transformers or the breakers, we are going to resume the submittal process for the electric stuff.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So we have that on pause for now.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So we are going to resume that and I'll ask that for Ahmed, your team, and also Brian's, if you guys can Expedite that.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: That way we can go ahead and order whatever we need to order.
**Jdawson**: All right, sounds good.
**Jdawson**: Thanks, everybody.
**Kevin.ly**: Oh, wait, Brian, are you still pulling anything up together or.
**Aelkarrimy**: No, yeah, I'm just about done here.
**Bclymer**: Oh, sweet.
**Bclymer**: Look at that.
**Cheryl.green**: Brian, I got that drawing coming right at you.
**Aelkarrimy**: I already found it.
**Aelkarrimy**: Sorry.
**Cheryl.green**: Okay, never mind.
**Aelkarrimy**: All right, so just.
**Aelkarrimy**: Just to confirm my understanding, the four Skype SkyPod boxes all remain the same from what I think from what we sent Aliato previously.
**Aelkarrimy**: So that was two 45 KVA transformers and two 75 KVA transformers.
**Aelkarrimy**: Keba.
**Aelkarrimy**: Does.
**Aelkarrimy**: Does that sound right on your end?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yes or.
**Aelkarrimy**: Brandon.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: All right.
**Aelkarrimy**: For the.
**Aelkarrimy**: For the sky path or the conveying system, we're now sitting at 1 90amp, three pole breaker and feeder, 1 125amp, three pole breaker and feeders, and 1 150amp, or excuse me.
**Aelkarrimy**: And two 150amp, three pole breakers and feeders, which was actually a.
**Aelkarrimy**: It's an increase from the original design, but a reduction from what we had previously put together when we had the 112 and a half KVA transformers.
**Jdawson**: So do you just keep the original breakers then?
**Aelkarrimy**: No, because I think.
**Daisuke.mine**: Let me label that 75 something.
**Aelkarrimy**: For the sky pods we had.
**Aelkarrimy**: We originally had four 125s.
**Aelkarrimy**: So one of those.
**Aelkarrimy**: And now two of those will remain 125s and two of them would be reduced to 90s.
**Jdawson**: Which.
**Jdawson**: Would you just do hundreds?
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah, I think they.
**Aelkarrimy**: Well, I can't remember if 90 is a standard size breaker or not.
**Aelkarrimy**: That's either a 90 or it's a 100.
**Aelkarrimy**: That would be set to a trip rating of 90.
**Aelkarrimy**: I think.
**Aelkarrimy**: I think we'd have to replace one two.
**Aelkarrimy**: I think three breakers would need to be replaced if I'm.
**Aelkarrimy**: If I'm running the math on my end.
**Aelkarrimy**: Right.
**Aelkarrimy**: And the.
**Aelkarrimy**: And the other five would be able to remain the same.
**Jdawson**: Okay, well, that's good news.
**Bclymer**: Cool.
**Jdawson**: Well, so tomorrow, Joe, you guys will have the final.
**Jdawson**: Final.
**Jdawson**: And then, you know, assuming that, you know, Brian, you've kind of already done the hard couch, then I guess is.
**Jdawson**: Is Friday reasonable to have a. Yep.
**Jdawson**: Get this, you know, number.
**Cheryl.green**: Yes, 100.
**Cheryl.green**: I'm hoping by.
**Cheryl.green**: Well, definitely by the end of tomorrow.
**Cheryl.green**: If not by lunch.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And then Brian, for you to double check and get your calcs.
**Jdawson**: I mean, is Friday reasonable for you to be able to suit us a note saying, you know, what we need to do?
**Jdawson**: Exactly.
**Aelkarrimy**: Yeah.
**Aelkarrimy**: If I can get confirmation tomorrow, I should be able to work something through work something out by end of day Friday, Monday at the very latest.
**Aelkarrimy**: If I need time, I can probably get it done this weekend.
**Aelkarrimy**: I'll probably be on this weekend, so.
**Jdawson**: Okay, perfect.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Then as you use that confirmation, we'll get it turned around and back to.
**Bclymer**: You guys, you see.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Do you have any questions?
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bryan.wagar**: So Joe, you're going to prepare the drawings tomorrow.
**Cheryl.green**: You said it's gonna be the final.
**Cheryl.green**: It's that chart that's in the chat where it says new numbers pending confirmation.
**Cheryl.green**: I'm just gonna.
**Cheryl.green**: We're gonna send over the final ones and hopefully will be the exact same.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Cheryl.green**: And then Brian will do his calculations, figure out how much we need to change from what.
**Cheryl.green**: And from what I'm hearing is does that mean we have to change less than what we originally thought?
**Aelkarrimy**: I believe so, yeah.
**Cheryl.green**: Okay, so that works in our favor.
**Bryan.wagar**: And sorry, let me confirm again, like what, what.
**Bryan.wagar**: What will be change?
**Cheryl.green**: Because we're.
**Cheryl.green**: The original plan had transformers where they were changing the 480 volts down to 400 and now we said we'll do half and half almost just to simplify it.
**Cheryl.green**: And we'll just take straight 480 volts on some of these.
**Cheryl.green**: But then that means that they have to get new breakers.
**Cheryl.green**: But now we're kind of saying that we might be able to use some of the old breakers.
**Cheryl.green**: If I'm saying that.
**Cheryl.green**: Right, Brian?
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: It looks like we're gonna get three new breakers.
**Bclymer**: Correct.
**Cheryl.green**: But the change order had us getting I think five new breakers or transformers and transformers.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bryan.wagar**: And this is triggered by updating the carton erector in my understanding.
**Bryan.wagar**: But Carbon Erector is not changing.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Cheryl.green**: The carton erectors changed and we got updated power requirements from our.
**Cheryl.green**: From our shipping label or lines.
**Bclymer**: Okay, okay.
**Bryan.wagar**: Let me.
**Bryan.wagar**: Let me just catch up and touch base with you after this one.
**Aelkarrimy**: Brandon.
**Aelkarrimy**: And.
**Aelkarrimy**: And Kebba, did we get.
**Aelkarrimy**: Did we get a credit back on those four transformers that were removed?
**Jdawson**: I don't know if we've moved done anything just yet because I don't think.
**Bclymer**: We'Ve had a.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Just return.
**Kevin.ly**: Two?
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Yes.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Out of the four, two are already delivered on site and two we were able to cancel before they shipped it.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: So there's credit for two, not.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Not all four.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: So Yusuke, at the.
**Aelkarrimy**: At the very least you've saved on two transformers because we.
**Aelkarrimy**: Those won't be needed anymore.
**Aelkarrimy**: There's two on site that with these new numbers still aren't needed.
**Bclymer**: It.
**Aelkarrimy**: You'll probably have to pay a restocking.
**Aelkarrimy**: Fee.
**Aelkarrimy**: Well, those were four hundreds grand and I thought we had talked about maybe not them not even taking them back, so.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that's right.
**Jdawson**: They're paper weights.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Aelkarrimy**: Okay.
**Aelkarrimy**: But you got, you got two that you saved some money on.
**Aelkarrimy**: Dare you suke?
**Cheryl.green**: Yeah, that was.
**Cheryl.green**: I think that was request or reflected in one of the change orders that Keva sent out when we had the two change orders to choose from.
**Kevin.ly**: And those credits were.
**Kevin.ly**: Will basically be applied to the transformer.
**Jdawson**: Change order, the breakers.
**Daisuke.mine**: But.
**Bclymer**: Yes, yes, yes.
**Cheryl.green**: Kevin, can you forward me that email again that has the two change orders in it?
**Cheryl.green**: Yes, I'm looking for it right now.
**Cheryl.green**: I don't know why I can't find it.
**Jdawson**: Did you get any other questions.
**Bryan.wagar**: For transformer?
**Bclymer**: No.
**Jdawson**: Are we okay about anything that we talked about today?
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, yeah, this is.
**Bryan.wagar**: This will go to actually exotics.
**Jdawson**: Change orders.
**Jdawson**: The change we'll go to exotic.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: But do you have any other questions for us.
**Bryan.wagar**: Or as of now.
**Bryan.wagar**: Yeah, nothing right now.
**Bryan.wagar**: If anything, I'll, I'll, I'll email you.
**Jdawson**: All right, sounds good.
**Bclymer**: Cool.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Thank you guys.
**Yukihiro.uekita**: Joe, I'll send you the email.
**Jdawson**: He already found it.
**Cheryl.green**: No, never mind.
**Kevin.ly**: He's good.
**Cheryl.green**: Yeah, this was the old one.
**Cheryl.green**: I'm undoing that one.
**Cheryl.green**: This was the original one.
**Cheryl.green**: I was like, man, that's a big.
**Jdawson**: Number, Joe, you guys.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I know it, I know.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Cheryl.green**: Appreciate it.
**Cheryl.green**: Yazuke.
**Cheryl.green**: I'll hang on.
**Cheryl.green**: Jesse, if you can cancel out the Firefly.
**Daisuke.mine**: You got it.
**Bclymer**: Thank you.
**Kevin.ly**: Do you need TPG on this call or are you okay?
**Bryan.wagar**: Oh, yeah, you can stay.
