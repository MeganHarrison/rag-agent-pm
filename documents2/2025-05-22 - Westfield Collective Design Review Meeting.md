## Transcript
**Bclymer**: Have the new.
**Bclymer**: The bathroom wall with a little curb as well as some of the VE options on the.
**Bclymer**: On the perimeter foundation to keep the sand in and the water out.
**Bclymer**: There was a curve that was supposed to be there.
**Bclymer**: So other than that, we have our foundation plans.
**Bclymer**: Everything has gone to cdr.
**Bclymer**: Alex or Brendan, have you guys gotten yours up to state yet?
**Jdawson**: I sent it to our permitting department and I'm going to follow up with them to make sure they're.
**Jdawson**: They're getting it there today.
**Bclymer**: Okay, that's not.
**Bclymer**: They don't have like a review or anything they got to do.
**Bclymer**: It's just.
**Bclymer**: They just need to submit it.
**Bclymer**: There's no.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, okay.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: Is Nick on?
**Nbigler**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Hey, what's up, Nick?
**Bclymer**: Do you have what you need at this point for the roof curbs, mezzanine openings?
**Nbigler**: Yes.
**Nbigler**: Other than are we screening just the four big units or what?
**Nbigler**: All is pending there.
**Nbigler**: Because right now the.
**Nbigler**: I would say the lead times for roof curbs as we make this change to keep in mind is about a month, maybe five weeks.
**Nbigler**: So we need to make the decision pretty quickly how it works if the roof curbs and our supplier needs to change to.
**Nbigler**: I don't think the guy.
**Nbigler**: Kentucky and a curbs that I've been going with has anything for screening.
**Nbigler**: If you want to do a roof curb that, you know, basically they can supply the screening material.
**Nbigler**: So there are different ways or avenues that it could go.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I wanted to speak with you about that and see if that was something that you guys were able to incorporate.
**Bclymer**: I think the guidance from the city is it just needs to look similar to the exterior of the building.
**Bclymer**: So if we had just vertical metal panels as the screen.
**Bclymer**: I saw one of the comments on the email chain saying we.
**Bclymer**: We needed to do three sides.
**Nbigler**: Three sides.
**Bclymer**: So yeah, if that's something I.
**Bclymer**: I did.
**Bclymer**: I did send an email to the city.
**Bclymer**: I don't know if they responded yet, but my question was.
**Awoodhams**: Hey, Nick too.
**Awoodhams**: We're looking at doing a bolt on.
**Awoodhams**: They sell these things that are manufactured.
**Awoodhams**: They bolt right onto the unit.
**Awoodhams**: So you don't have to do anything to your roof or attach to the structure.
**Awoodhams**: And if that ends up being the most economical way to go, we're going to move forward with that.
**Nbigler**: Yeah.
**Nbigler**: So what you're saying is you found somebody that would just frame it or does it come with the sheeting and trims as well?
**Awoodhams**: Yeah, the companies I've worked at before, they.
**Awoodhams**: That's like a pre manufactured thing.
**Awoodhams**: They have different panel designs and it's it's all, it's like a frame that bolts off the side of the RTU and, and it just has the panels on it already.
**Awoodhams**: So we just need to look into that before we try and make any changes or trying to support this from your structure or the roof or anything else.
**Nbigler**: Yep.
**Nbigler**: I would say you guys do all that you can, you know, decide what three sides are going to be screened, all that good stuff.
**Nbigler**: And then, you know, if and when you guys think you have a good resolution, I would just say reach out to us, me and Brandt.
**Nbigler**: I'm gonna be gone for two weeks starting tomorrow, just as a reminder.
**Nbigler**: So Brandt, he's here on this meeting right now with me.
**Nbigler**: So he would be your contact as you guys get closer to making that decision.
**Nbigler**: We just need to know what it weighs for sure ultimately as well.
**Bclymer**: So I kind of asked the city if what their guidance was on this, you know, if we can do three sides.
**Bclymer**: This is the west side.
**Bclymer**: So this week they're more, I guess concerned about grand park being able to see it.
**Bclymer**: So we have parapet on the south side.
**Bclymer**: Oops on the south side.
**Bclymer**: Or if they're gonna, you know, have us do an entire box, you know, an entire area like that.
**Bclymer**: I, you know, of course I found these cinema examples on, you know, what kind of, what are, what, what are they expecting?
**Bclymer**: Have you, have you done one in Westfield?
**Bclymer**: Do you know what their, you know, requirements are or anything like that?
**Nbigler**: No, have not done that in Westfield.
**Nbigler**: If we have to do a huge one that goes across the whole roof, I feel like that would bad.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I, I don't think that they're going to make us do that, but.
**Nbigler**: Yeah, I would doubt that.
**Bclymer**: So Andrew's been looking at, looking for some other options to see, you know, who can provide a screen that just mounts to the curb as well.
**Bclymer**: Jeff had recommended some type of pre made assembly.
**Bclymer**: Essentially.
**Nbigler**: You said curbs plus.
**Awoodhams**: Sign along from there, email.
**Bclymer**: Something, something that's already prefabbed like this and all the framing is done.
**Bclymer**: You get it?
**Bclymer**: Manny said that cost, it's more cost effective to do it this way.
**Bclymer**: By the time you end up trying to do customization on a panel and everything like that, it's just easier to do it this way and more cost effective.
**Bclymer**: So Nick.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, we can talk offline about this and if you are able to.
**Bclymer**: Oh shoot, I'm not sharing my screen anymore.
**Nbigler**: Yeah, you are.
**Nbigler**: Curbs plus, that's who we were thinking about going with.
**Nbigler**: If you wanted something to come with the manufacturer of the roof, curb.
**Bclymer**: This one.
**Bclymer**: You see what I'm.
**Bclymer**: You see what I have here?
**Nbigler**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Gdesmit**: I mean, ideally we prefer for it not to attach to the roof or penetrate the roof at all and have to go down to the steel.
**Gdesmit**: That would be a worst case scenario.
**Gdesmit**: If anything, we'd love to keep it attached to the unit or to the curb.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah, we agree.
**Bclymer**: That's what I was just sharing as.
**Awoodhams**: An example of that.
**Awoodhams**: That thing just.
**Awoodhams**: It sets over the curb, it's self supporting, and it just.
**Awoodhams**: It just hangs out there off the curb.
**Awoodhams**: Correct?
**Nbigler**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Were you sharing something, Jesse?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, sorry.
**Bclymer**: I've jacked your screen.
**Awoodhams**: So this is just one of many companies here.
**Awoodhams**: There we go.
**Awoodhams**: This place called Curbs Plus.
**Awoodhams**: This thing, it just has these brackets that sit over the curb.
**Awoodhams**: It's got its structure out here with the panels go in it.
**Gdesmit**: Yeah, that's the vendor we were looking.
**Bclymer**: At as well, so.
**Awoodhams**: Okay.
**Awoodhams**: I've seen some others that actually bolt to the unit.
**Awoodhams**: So we got some options, especially if we only have to do three sides.
**Nbigler**: Yeah.
**Nbigler**: I would say just next steps would be select something that Westfield approves, get the weights to Barco Pruden, and see if they need to do anything to the structure to, you know, make the change as well.
**Bclymer**: I don't have anything back from Ryan at the city yet, but he's been pretty responsive, so.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I'll get with you, Nick.
**Bclymer**: And if that's something that you guys can provide also, then we'll.
**Bclymer**: We'll check that out.
**Bclymer**: You said Curves plus would be your vendor or you guys would fab it.
**Nbigler**: Curbs plus would be the vendor.
**Nbigler**: If we were going to go with, you know, everything comes out with the curb situation.
**Bclymer**: Good.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Gdesmit**: Yeah.
**Gdesmit**: The screen would attach to the unit that would go through the mechanical guy.
**Awoodhams**: Right.
**Bclymer**: So depending on the weight, Nick, it would.
**Bclymer**: It could or may or may not be able to be addressed in the field.
**Bclymer**: Where you think, oh, yeah.
**Nbigler**: I mean, at this point, everything would have to be addressed in the field.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So you're saying send it back to Varco Prudent for.
**Bclymer**: For the weight and stuff, so.
**Nbigler**: Correct.
**Nbigler**: So we would have to go through Varco Prudin.
**Nbigler**: Oh, and do all the calcs.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Nbigler**: And then if we had to stiffen up the building, they would send out, you know, reinforcement angle or whatever the solution would be.
**Ashton**: It's just from a structural perspective.
**Ashton**: Even if we do attach directly to the unit, I'm not sure how we can get away with, like, not adding more loading to the Building because the units attached to the curb and the curbs attached to the roof framing.
**Ashton**: So.
**Bclymer**: Just.
**Ashton**: Just as a heads up, there will be some amount of engineering that will be required, kind of no matter how we do the screen.
**Nbigler**: Yeah.
**Nbigler**: Agree.
**Nbigler**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Jerrica, did you.
**Bclymer**: Do you have everything you need from us or from Merit, the subcontractor, any of the drawings from the ve stuff that.
**Ashton**: You were gonna talk about yesterday?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Do you need any drawings or anything from them or markups that they sent that they have made?
**Ashton**: If they have some additional markups that would be helpful.
**Ashton**: Just so that we don't do the.
**Bclymer**: Ones that we sent from back when Grant was there.
**Bclymer**: But he.
**Bclymer**: The guy that was estimating before.
**Bclymer**: But I still have those if you.
**Bclymer**: If you need me to, like, fresh.
**Bclymer**: Freshen them back up with tea or something.
**Bclymer**: But he.
**Bclymer**: I guess he also put him on the markup on his submittal, too, didn't he?
**Ashton**: Yeah, he did.
**Ashton**: Okay.
**Ashton**: No, I think that we're good.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: Jeff is at jury duty today, but we have Eli joining us next week, and he will be running with the FF and E final kind of design.
**Bclymer**: As far as the finishes, colors, tile, final coordinations and stuff.
**Bclymer**: We will start getting some questions answered as far as running power for.
**Bclymer**: For demon floor boxes.
**Bclymer**: De and Spencer, somebody from Spencer on.
**Bclymer**: Is there anything.
**Bclymer**: Hey, Micah, is there anything that you guys need in the.
**Bclymer**: In the interim between now and, you know, a couple weeks from now when they start getting involved with the project and start getting us any type of progress or answers?
**Bclymer**: Is there something you guys need that I can at least get to his team right now while he's out of.
**Bclymer**: Obviously, we have the liberty plans for design intent, but is there any power requirements or any.
**Bclymer**: Anything like that that you guys want to get started working on that I could potentially get from them?
**Jdawson**: No, I think just the FF and E is all.
**Jdawson**: We're really waiting, and I think we're.
**Awoodhams**: Good with everything right now.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, you guys, I don't.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I don't think any of his ffiti should affect.
**Bclymer**: I don't think there's any sink or water fountain or anything.
**Bclymer**: That's part of his stuff.
**Bclymer**: And then, Dean, you guys, I know you set your plans over yesterday.
**Bclymer**: I haven't looked through all of them.
**Bclymer**: You guys got the.
**Bclymer**: The items here, added the air curtains, the fans.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Bathroom lighting.
**Bclymer**: What.
**Bclymer**: Where was that?
**Bclymer**: The interior of the.
**Bclymer**: The bar?
**Bclymer**: Or was that for the new bathroom?
**Jdawson**: For the new bathroom.
**Jdawson**: Basically, all the power for the new bathroom, we.
**Bclymer**: We took care of.
**Bclymer**: I.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I had a note on the.
**Bclymer**: On the meeting here that you guys needed bathroom lighting.
**Bclymer**: Was that waiting for a selection for bathroom lighting or.
**Jdawson**: That was for the new bathroom.
**Bclymer**: Okay, walk in cooler power and check that we got that added.
**Bclymer**: I assume floor boxes walk in cooler.
**Bclymer**: You guys are good to go on that?
**Nbigler**: Yep, got it.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, there it is.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: Is there anything else that you guys need from a design perspective or answers from either the owner for the new bathroom or anything?
**Bclymer**: Anything else?
**Bclymer**: These already went to cdr, went up to state for CDR and deems is going up today.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: Chris.
**Bclymer**: I'm good.
**Bclymer**: Chris is on here today, I think.
**Bclymer**: Chris Lopez.
**Bclymer**: Chris is our fire suppression contractors with Siemens.
**Bclymer**: Chris, what do you.
**Bclymer**: Do you need anything to get your fire suppression drawings and stuff ready to.
**Bclymer**: Ready to go and submit.
**Brhoades**: Just when the.
**Brhoades**: The new.
**Brhoades**: Sounds like the new bathroom walls.
**Brhoades**: And when those get issued, we can update our drawings and get them in.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I have.
**Bclymer**: I have all those.
**Bclymer**: I'll send them.
**Bclymer**: I'll email you updated drawings for everything when we end the call.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Brhoades**: Perfect.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: How long does it take you guys to kick those back?
**Bclymer**: Daniel, or.
**Bclymer**: Sorry, Chris.
**Brhoades**: Takes anywhere between three and seven business days.
**Brhoades**: We don't usually have any kickback issues neither.
**Brhoades**: Like it's pretty much just the pay the toll bridge and you're good.
**Bclymer**: So if I put you at the 6th, June 6th.
**Bclymer**: That's two.
**Bclymer**: Let's get into the stuff today.
**Bclymer**: That gives you guys next week and half the following week.
**Bclymer**: So just two weeks.
**Bclymer**: June 6th, you guys, you'd be able to have those ready, you think?
**Brhoades**: Oh, yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Brhoades**: I've already.
**Brhoades**: Yeah, I've already got them done.
**Brhoades**: I just need the updated walls and then I can make my adjustments and turn them in.
**Bclymer**: Dean, when are you planning to get the fire alarm drawings down so we can just track a date?
**Jdawson**: I have to talk to Brennan.
**Jdawson**: I Not sure.
**Bclymer**: All right, no problem.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Jesse, do you have anything to add into the design meeting here before we start putting concrete in the ground?
**Bclymer**: No.
**Awoodhams**: Hopefully we're about done with the design.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I think we're wrapping up.
**Bclymer**: I don't.
**Bclymer**: I think, you know, at this point, Jerrica, I don't know if you need to be on anymore.
**Bclymer**: Next start next week.
**Bclymer**: It'll mostly be probably.
**Bclymer**: Mostly De, Jeff and Eli and probably Nick.
**Bclymer**: You're never getting out of here.
**Bclymer**: So see you next week.
**Nbigler**: Figured.
**Nbigler**: Figured as much.
**Bclymer**: Bo, you're welcome to join, as always.
**Bclymer**: We'll have FF and E.
**Bclymer**: I don't think that'll have anything to.
**Bclymer**: To to do with you, so.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I was just sitting in, so.
**Bclymer**: Worse.
**Bclymer**: Awesome.
**Bclymer**: All right, guys, if nobody has anything else, we'll wrap it up, and I will drop.
**Bclymer**: Drop some of you guys off the invite for next week.
**Bclymer**: We appreciate all your efforts in the design and working hard to.
**Bclymer**: To help us get these deadlines met.
**Bclymer**: Appreciate, everybody.
**Awoodhams**: Thank you.
**Bclymer**: Thank you, guys.
**Nbigler**: Thanks.
**Nbigler**: See you.
