## Transcript
**Aaskew**: Now that we have three toddlers, so.
**Avelina**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: That'S good.
**Bclymer**: Glad you're on.
**Avelina**: Right.
**Aaskew**: Well, and that I.
**Aaskew**: I did have a question for you.
**Aaskew**: I'm so.
**Aaskew**: I.
**Aaskew**: I did not have this meeting in my calendar, you know, I didn't know.
**Aaskew**: I didn't have it in my inbox, so I'm not sure what this meeting is in reference to.
**Aaskew**: I got some text on my business line, text reminders about the meeting, and so I didn't know if, you know, y' all had either meant to send me something on this or it wound up in my spam folder or this was just a mistake.
**Aaskew**: But, you know, since I knew who you were, I was like, well, let me just hop on and see.
**Bclymer**: See if I.
**Bclymer**: I think it was a mistake.
**Bclymer**: Jonathan.
**Daniel**: Oh, good.
**Bclymer**: Because Daniel is bringing a client in for.
**Bclymer**: For me to talk to about some potential planning, so.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, I see his name on the list either.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I don't know how it bounced in on your side, so.
**Bclymer**: But it's good to see you.
**Bclymer**: It's a little bit of a surprise for me to see, but it's great to see you, man.
**Aaskew**: Hey, good to see you as well.
**Aaskew**: And if you ever need any help, don't.
**Aaskew**: Don't hesitate to reach out.
**Bclymer**: I will.
**Bclymer**: I certainly won't.
**Avelina**: Thank you, man.
**Aaskew**: Sure thing.
**Daniel**: Alrighty.
**Aaskew**: Well, good luck getting Daniel on the line or whoever.
**Aaskew**: Whoever the client is supposed to be might want to give.
**Bclymer**: Thanks, man.
**Avelina**: Appreciate it.
**Avelina**: Well, that was strange.
**Mcalcetero**: It was because I looked at the calendar of it.
**Mcalcetero**: I'm like, we don't have a Jonathan in here.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, he's.
**Bclymer**: He's a CPA that I've worked with before.
**Bclymer**: So I've known him for years and years.
**Bclymer**: So, so, so good.
**Mcalcetero**: Believe we have Brandon here now.
**Bclymer**: He is here up.
**Bclymer**: So, Brandon, my name is Ben.
**Bclymer**: I.
**Bclymer**: I've been working with Daniel for several years.
**Bclymer**: My background is such that I sold my accounting firm back in 14, opened a.
**Bclymer**: Bought my dad's railroad construction company.
**Bclymer**: I opened a tax resolution firm back in 17, and I switched over to doing a lot more tax planning in when Covid hit because good old Uncle Sam essentially stopped forcing people to pay.
**Bclymer**: So I do both tax resolution and tax planning.
**Bclymer**: That's sort of the.
**Bclymer**: The.
**Bclymer**: The thing that I do.
**Bclymer**: I keep between one and three dozen.
**Avelina**: Cases in tax court at all times.
**Bclymer**: So all of the strategy that I have is built off of code, regulation and.
**Bclymer**: Or case law.
**Bclymer**: A lot more case law than most.
**Avelina**: Right.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So just as a.
**Bclymer**: As a background for me.
**Avelina**: Is that all right?
**Avelina**: Yeah.
**Daniel**: So I know the one that made that video, right?
**Bclymer**: I did.
**Avelina**: I did.
**Bclymer**: So I first, like, I was excited the whole time.
**Daniel**: Do I.
**Daniel**: I said it's riveting.
**Daniel**: I was excited.
**Daniel**: I was on the edge of my seat the whole time.
**Bclymer**: I, I think tax planning is, it's just, just me.
**Daniel**: Action packed.
**Mcalcetero**: Just, just, just me and Ben.
**Mcalcetero**: We're the only ones that get excited about tax.
**Mcalcetero**: And Brandon, Brandon, you're the third.
**Daniel**: Yeah.
**Mcalcetero**: Third person to get excited about tax stuff because everyone else, it's, it's the antithesis of exciting.
**Avelina**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So today what I'd like to do is go over.
**Bclymer**: So I have a proven process that I've created.
**Bclymer**: I call it the golden path.
**Bclymer**: And we always start with an investigation and what I call a goal crystallization.
**Bclymer**: The number one way to get to a goal is, of course, a straight path.
**Bclymer**: And so sometimes we need to cut the path through.
**Avelina**: And I like to know a little.
**Bclymer**: Bit more about you now in regards to the stepladder.
**Bclymer**: The stepladder's goals are threefold.
**Bclymer**: Number one, asset protection.
**Bclymer**: We want to make sure that your personal assets are protected against lawsuit.
**Bclymer**: Number two, income tax reduction.
**Bclymer**: And then number three, estate tax reduction.
**Bclymer**: We know that the estate rules and laws change as of 1126.
**Bclymer**: I know that the one big beautiful bill is out there and big beautiful bill.
**Bclymer**: We don't know, we don't know if it's going to pass yet.
**Bclymer**: We know that it went through the house and I haven't.
**Bclymer**: Daniel, have you seen anything in it about the estate tax exemption?
**Mcalcetero**: So they are going to jack it up, I believe, and they're going to make it permanent because the last time we raised the estate tax exemption, it was temporary.
**Mcalcetero**: And so I want to say they're going to increase it even higher than it was before.
**Mcalcetero**: But more importantly, there's going to be permanency to it instead of, hey, tax breaks, but only for a few years until you reelect me and I have to pass the tax breaks again.
**Bclymer**: Well, that has, that has more to do with, you know, the number of votes too.
**Bclymer**: So, yeah, Congress is funky.
**Bclymer**: So, you know, Brandon, my goal today is to, to talk about number one, to see if you had questions in regards to step ladder.
**Bclymer**: I'd like to go over a couple things with it, too.
**Bclymer**: And then number two, I'd like to know a little bit more about where you want to go and what the.
**Avelina**: What the goal is that you have.
**Bclymer**: You know, because not.
**Bclymer**: I don't believe that there's any one strategy that's like A silver bullet.
**Bclymer**: I don't think that, you know, there's one pathway to permanence when it comes to tax planning.
**Bclymer**: And the reason is because, you know, goals change over time and your situation changes over time.
**Bclymer**: While I do believe that the step ladder is one of the ways that is as close to what I call a silver bullet as there is.
**Bclymer**: However, it's not perfect and it's not for everybody.
**Bclymer**: What I mean by that is every strategy has a con, and we just want to make sure that we have more pros than cons in any strategy.
**Bclymer**: That.
**Mcalcetero**: Free lunch.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: That's ultimately put in place.
**Bclymer**: So could you.
**Bclymer**: Do you mind, Brandon, tell me a little bit about where it is you want to go, let's say, in the next five to 10 years and what your goal is?
**Daniel**: Yeah, so let me.
**Daniel**: How about this.
**Daniel**: How about I tell you what I think I understand and you can fill in the blanks.
**Daniel**: So.
**Daniel**: So I, I found out about this through guy that I work with, mentor named Ryan Idell.
**Daniel**: And so he told me about this whole setup thing, got me introduced to, to, you know, your whole team.
**Daniel**: And from my understanding, the, the biggest thing is through this trust system being able to essentially defer income tax, you know, perpetually, essentially, as long as I'm going to be alive, probably.
**Daniel**: And, and that's kind of the.
**Daniel**: Now, obviously you're going to have some, some fees and a little bit.
**Daniel**: But instead of my, you know, tax bracket being 30, 40%, whatever that is, can net down to maybe 5%, you know, after fees and whatnot.
**Daniel**: That's, that's my understanding of the overarching thing.
**Daniel**: Now, as far as what my goal is, obviously my goal is to lower my tax burden as much as possible because right now, you know, and, and I'm learning different ways.
**Daniel**: Like, for instance, like I just bought into a solar company, you know, that $250,000 buy in that I had to pay for.
**Daniel**: Well, I have to use after tax dollars or, you know, like, like one.
**Daniel**: One way I can do is I can take a loan against, you know, from my company, but I've got to have something to back it in order to justify the loan, which is where I've got to get whole life cash policies put in place.
**Daniel**: But in general, it's very difficult for me to use this money that I have without having to pay tax, because literally every single thing that I buy, the government's going to say, oh, you have to pay taxes on that, and then you can go buy it and then pay more taxes on that it's.
**Daniel**: And it's just never ending.
**Daniel**: So my, my goal is to be able to limit that to where, like, I can go and like this, like, I can buy that company with essentially my actual money before the taxes.
**Daniel**: Like, and then, you know, I'll tax myself based off my salary and everything.
**Daniel**: Like, I'm not like, I believe justifiably that I, like, I grew up in a country where I didn't have to worry about being.
**Bclymer**: To cut you off.
**Bclymer**: But do y' all know Evelina?
**Bclymer**: Rolling.
**Bclymer**: Never heard of that too.
**Bclymer**: With you, Daniel.
**Mcalcetero**: That's my comms director.
**Bclymer**: I'm sorry.
**Bclymer**: I'm sorry, Brandon.
**Bclymer**: I didn't mean to cut you off.
**Daniel**: Yeah.
**Daniel**: So I, you know, I believe that I was fortunate to grow up in this country and I do, you know, want to pay taxes because without that, nobody is where I think the big difference is.
**Daniel**: The amount that I pay is what I don't agree with.
**Avelina**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So you're 100% right.
**Bclymer**: When we look at a 30,000 foot view, this system is a tax deferral system and it is perpetual.
**Bclymer**: And you pay tax when one of two things happens.
**Bclymer**: Number one, the money itself is given to a beneficiary.
**Bclymer**: Or number two, you take the money out of the trust to use for yourself.
**Bclymer**: Now, if you take it out for yourself, there are certain things that may be taxable, may not be taxable.
**Bclymer**: It depends on what is ultimately put in by you and you having what we call a demand note.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so with that being said, it really depends on some of it that you take out may not be taxable.
**Bclymer**: But I tell people just consider all of it taxable to think about it until we talk.
**Daniel**: Now, my understanding with that is because at the end of the day, you know, to have the walking around money, right?
**Daniel**: If, you know, if I want to go buy a car or a watch or whatever, you know, some expensive luxury item, you know, and not have to pay taxes on it.
**Daniel**: That's where the whole cash life policy, because you're now using debt and you don't pay taxes on that.
**Bclymer**: That's right.
**Bclymer**: So you're still going to receive a W2 from your company.
**Bclymer**: We are not going to be able to stop that.
**Bclymer**: It does need to be what we call reasonable.
**Bclymer**: So we do a reasonable compensation study for you to make sure that the amount that you're being paid is the right amount.
**Mcalcetero**: We have one of those friends too, by the way.
**Mcalcetero**: Ben.
**Mcalcetero**: We've gotten our C or frame set up already.
**Bclymer**: Good.
**Bclymer**: So you're already being paid the right amount.
**Bclymer**: Now that money is going to pay for your food fund fashion, it's going to pay for your groceries every day, it's going to pay for your entertainment and it's going to pay for your, your clothing.
**Bclymer**: You know, the trust itself will not pay for those things.
**Bclymer**: But so far as luxury cars or things like that, the trust absolutely can purchase those.
**Bclymer**: And the other way to get money to beneficiaries is that there's something called hims health, education, maintenance and support.
**Bclymer**: Health of course is, you know, if they get put into the hospital, health insurance, anything like that.
**Bclymer**: The thought is that the money does not go to the beneficiary and then the beneficiary pay for it.
**Bclymer**: The thought is that it goes to the third party in lieu of the beneficiary.
**Bclymer**: And now the beneficiary can receive benefit from the third party without them receiving the money.
**Bclymer**: If the beneficiary receives the cash, they have to pay tax on it.
**Bclymer**: There is no ifs, ands or buts about it.
**Bclymer**: But let's say for example, you wanted to buy a 16 year old child their first car.
**Bclymer**: So the trust pays $20,000 for Honda Civic or whatever.
**Bclymer**: It can absolutely do that.
**Bclymer**: And it's not taxable to the beneficiary.
**Bclymer**: Of course the vehicle is in the trust name and the beneficiary can use the vehicle without having to pay tax and personal gain there.
**Bclymer**: So you know, it can be used in those settings, of course for health education.
**Bclymer**: Maintenance and support are very, very broad terms.
**Bclymer**: And when we look at maintenance and support, that's absolutely what you think it would be.
**Bclymer**: So if you have a college student that is a beneficiary, the trust can pay for their living expenses, it can pay for their groceries, like a meal card or something like that.
**Bclymer**: Absolutely.
**Bclymer**: Without a problem.
**Bclymer**: We just want to make sure that you as the trustee don't receive benefits without us taking those benefits into account.
**Bclymer**: That is some type of loan, that is some type of tax taxable benefit that you have to pay tax on personally.
**Bclymer**: So that's really the, the idea.
**Bclymer**: And you're right.
**Bclymer**: The we put the plan in place and then we help you maintain, we help you, we teach you what is a taxable benefit, how can you do it, how should we structure it?
**Bclymer**: How does the life insurance work?
**Bclymer**: Because you put in life insurance for yourself and then you take loans against it.
**Bclymer**: Absolutely.
**Bclymer**: That's something that can be done.
**Bclymer**: So we just want to make sure that we dot the right I's across the right teas.
**Bclymer**: So Like I said earlier, I deal a lot with audit.
**Bclymer**: I have CPAs, attorneys, and enrolled agents that refer clients to us that are in audit.
**Bclymer**: Typically, they'll come at the end or during the middle of the first phase of the audit.
**Bclymer**: And there's multiple phases.
**Bclymer**: So when we get that client, we look to see what appeal rights we have, what appeal rights we don't have, and when a client goes in audit.
**Bclymer**: Brandon, have you ever been audited?
**Daniel**: Not yet.
**Daniel**: Thank God.
**Bclymer**: Okay, good.
**Bclymer**: So when they audit you, one of the things that they say is, hey, I'd like to see all the receipts for advertising, for example.
**Bclymer**: And so you give them the receipts for advertising.
**Bclymer**: Let's say that you took a deduction for advertising for $200,000 on your tax return, but you could only come up with $160,000 worth of receipts.
**Bclymer**: That right there is what we call the substance of the transaction.
**Avelina**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Not necessarily the form.
**Avelina**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: The form is just what, you know, the documents that allow the transaction itself to happen.
**Bclymer**: Typically, in an audit, you lose if the substance itself does not match.
**Bclymer**: So when we look at form versus the way the cash flows, those two things need to essentially meet.
**Bclymer**: And when they meet, it's the glue that stops the IRS from being able to have a change in that audit.
**Bclymer**: So a lot of the things that I do is going to be based off of how can I beat an audit?
**Bclymer**: And the reason I do it that way is not because we think one's coming.
**Bclymer**: It's because preparation is the key to stop any type of change.
**Bclymer**: And if I'm going to tell you, look, this is what we want to do, and everything I do is based off of regulations, code, case law, and the internal Internal Revenue Manual.
**Bclymer**: Then we want to make sure that we push the right buttons to assure that we're going to beat an audit if one comes.
**Bclymer**: You know what I mean?
**Daniel**: Yeah, yeah.
**Daniel**: I mean, I guess because the biggest thing is, like, so if I.
**Avelina**: If.
**Daniel**: If I look at my stuff right now, like, they would come through.
**Daniel**: He's like, is that a business pen?
**Daniel**: It's like, no, I would get hammered.
**Daniel**: And so finding out a way to of avoid that but still be able to actually spend my money on what I want to is.
**Daniel**: Now, my understanding is that there are basically two ways that this can be done.
**Daniel**: So one is taking, let's just say, one company like Alito, right.
**Daniel**: My main company, and transferring ownership to an irrevocable trust.
**Daniel**: And then the money flows into there, and then that goes into that, that no income tax, perpetual shield thing.
**Daniel**: That's one way to do it.
**Daniel**: But of course then I'm giving up control.
**Daniel**: The other way to do it is to have a separate company that is owned by the trust that holds the IP that bills Alito, whatever every year for whatever that might be.
**Daniel**: And then again, that essentially takes the money's off, money off of Alito's books, puts it into this, which then goes into shielding.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I'm going to share my screen real quick.
**Bclymer**: I want to talk to you a little bit about that.
**Bclymer**: I do it very close to what you just said.
**Bclymer**: I am a fan and let me know if you can see my screen.
**Bclymer**: I am a fan of not necessarily having your entity be owned by the trust, let's say your business here.
**Bclymer**: Let me grab a laser real quick.
**Bclymer**: So your business right here stays owned by you.
**Bclymer**: So when I look at the control structure itself, it stays being owned by you.
**Bclymer**: That business may not necessarily be owned by the business trust itself.
**Bclymer**: The reason is because if this business is already set up and running and making profits, the only way for this business trust to own a portion of this is to actually purchase it.
**Avelina**: Right.
**Bclymer**: And so when this company already up running, making good profits, just steamrolling, it's going to be hard for this entity to purchase this company.
**Bclymer**: Now if it's a new company, absolutely, the business trust should probably own it.
**Avelina**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Like you said.
**Bclymer**: But we want to make sure that that transaction that sell here has an ability to pay for itself.
**Bclymer**: So if you personally, Brandon, were to sell a portion of your business into the trust, you're going to receive like a demand note or something back from this business.
**Bclymer**: But this business also has to have a wherewithal to this business trust has to have a wherewithal to pay you back.
**Bclymer**: And the only way that that happens is that this business pay into the trust for the trust to pay you.
**Bclymer**: That necessarily doesn't avoid the tax on that payment because that business trust paying you is going to be taxable to you.
**Avelina**: Okay?
**Bclymer**: So what I do instead is like you said, I'll talk about the IP here in a moment, but there's a management fee that rolls into the business trust from the business.
**Bclymer**: Now this is 97%.
**Bclymer**: A lot of people say I want to move 90%, 95%.
**Bclymer**: My goal is 70, okay?
**Bclymer**: I'm conservative in that manner.
**Bclymer**: And if I say if you make a million dollars net profit, if I were to move $700,000 into that net profit, you're already in the top bracket, you're in the 37% bracket and then the state, you're going to add another 5%.
**Bclymer**: Let's just say you're in Indiana, right?
**Avelina**: Yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: So let's, let's say another 5%.
**Bclymer**: So you're moving 42% or so of taxable income over into a deferred portion.
**Bclymer**: So of that, let's call it $700,000, we're going to save taxes on, we're going to save about $300,000 in tax on that move.
**Avelina**: Right.
**Bclymer**: So with us making that move, the thought is if I only move 70% and you still had that $300,000 plus your W2 to pay taxes on, we saved $300,000 in tax ultimately.
**Bclymer**: Now we, we do it through that management fee.
**Bclymer**: We could have a lease.
**Bclymer**: I'll give an example of a lease.
**Bclymer**: We had this family trust purchase an X ray machine or an MRI machine for the business and the business actually leases it from the family trust.
**Bclymer**: And because of that, that's one way we're being able to pull quite a bit of profits back out because that lease is going to be more than what that one time depreciation was over a longer period of time.
**Bclymer**: So let's say that that X ray machine costs $600,000.
**Bclymer**: Well, that business gets a $600,000 right now.
**Bclymer**: But what about, you know, three years from now?
**Bclymer**: So that's what we're trying to get when we look at what our goals are versus our, you know, where we are currently.
**Bclymer**: And so that we were able to pull a course, quite a bit of lease payment from that business to land inside that family trust.
**Bclymer**: And then the royalty, what you said there is, is perfect.
**Bclymer**: So there's a tax court case, Bras Trucking that essentially says, and Martin Ice Cream, it essentially says that Brandon owns the personal goodwill for the business.
**Bclymer**: Personal.
**Bclymer**: Right now you own it.
**Bclymer**: And so if you as an individual own that personal goodwill, you can sell that goodwill into the family trust.
**Bclymer**: And that's what we have you do.
**Bclymer**: We, we have you sell that intellectual property into that family trust.
**Bclymer**: Now if this business has other, what we call hard intellectual property such as patents, trademarks, copyrights, things like that, we may want to sell that into the family trust as well.
**Bclymer**: However, if we only move the personal goodwill in now that the family trust owns it, we have a lease agreement here where it pays royalties in order for this business to pay the family trust for the use of that intellectual property.
**Daniel**: Now what is the, you said goodwill.
**Daniel**: What is the goodwill?
**Bclymer**: So goodwill that you have created in that business are going to be things like there's corporate goodwill and there's personal goodwill.
**Bclymer**: It's how Brandon has built that company up over the years.
**Bclymer**: That's your personal goodwill.
**Bclymer**: Corporate goodwill is going to be ultimately things like a client list, a process.
**Bclymer**: So the personal goodwill is, Brandon building the process.
**Bclymer**: The process itself is owned by the entity, but you created that process, so that's your goodwill.
**Bclymer**: So goodwill is bifurcated into corporate and personal.
**Bclymer**: Okay, you own the personal side.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Daniel**: So give me an example.
**Daniel**: Right.
**Daniel**: So when I think of ip, like I think of policies and procedures, all that stuff that we create, Our, our, the way our estimate takeoff sheets, all that stuff that I've created.
**Avelina**: Yeah.
**Daniel**: So that.
**Daniel**: Those are, those are real tangible things.
**Bclymer**: Those are, those are tangible items.
**Bclymer**: Those are hard tangible items.
**Bclymer**: But Brandon thinking those things up is the personal goodwill.
**Daniel**: And how do you.
**Daniel**: I guess.
**Daniel**: So if we're going to say, all right, that personal goodwill is worth $100,000 a month in leasing, how do you.
**Bclymer**: So we get this company valued.
**Bclymer**: The company has to be valued.
**Bclymer**: And I've got it.
**Bclymer**: I've got a valuation expert that will break out all of that for me.
**Bclymer**: And that's.
**Bclymer**: And that's part of it, you know, because if I'm going to use a tax court case to build the why, then I've got to have an outside third party to validate that no number.
**Bclymer**: So that outside third party gives me this percentage.
**Bclymer**: They'll give me this percentage here and now.
**Bclymer**: The difference is we've got to come up with creative ways to make sure that these numbers are going to ultimately pull in.
**Bclymer**: Let's call it 70, 80, 90% of the profits.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so let's say that, let's say that.
**Bclymer**: Well, let me ask you this, Brandon.
**Bclymer**: What, what's your profit ratio right now, profit versus income?
**Bclymer**: 15%.
**Bclymer**: 20%?
**Daniel**: Yeah, I'd say maybe 15.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so 15%.
**Bclymer**: And let's, let's say, for example, that this company was valued and it said that the royalty could be 6%.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: That's 6% of gross.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: 6% of gross is almost 50% of your profit.
**Bclymer**: You see what I mean?
**Daniel**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: That's why this number is so high.
**Bclymer**: So if you're at a 15% profit and we roll 6% into the royalty, then, you know, we've, we've already been able to move quite a bit of the number in pretty easily.
**Bclymer**: Now, the difference can be management fees and, or lease fees and things like that.
**Bclymer**: And it depends on your entity.
**Bclymer**: So if your entity is more service based or if it's More product based or if you have to have big items to build the products.
**Bclymer**: I'll give you an example.
**Bclymer**: One of my clients is a weapons manufacturer and they have seven or 10 CNC machines to build the weapons.
**Bclymer**: And these are like they retool themselves and all that.
**Bclymer**: I mean, I watch them and these things are crazy.
**Bclymer**: Anyway, so we took those machines and we move those, we sold those over into the family trust and now they had that lease where the business can lease back.
**Bclymer**: So this number right here is pretty big, right?
**Bclymer**: This can, the leases can be for larger items or smaller items.
**Bclymer**: And we haven't even talked about the asset protection yet.
**Bclymer**: So for example, you know, for them, that weapons manufacturer company, if they were sued, those CNC machines are sort of the life of the company, right?
**Bclymer**: Because they made the products, you know, they made the little springs and whatever it is that they needed to make for that weapon.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Avelina**: Same way with you, what we.
**Bclymer**: Want to do is we want to try to pull out the big things out of your company, roll them into the family trust.
**Bclymer**: Maybe, maybe, maybe not.
**Bclymer**: And it depends on, on you.
**Bclymer**: Let's say, for example, that, and this is my thought, let's say that you wanted to run another eight years and then you wanted an exit in eight years.
**Bclymer**: Well, what we do is we sit down and we figure out, because it's always about taking an inventory of where we are and then getting our goal set.
**Bclymer**: And then it's cutting the path to the goal, okay?
**Bclymer**: And I do that every single time.
**Bclymer**: The, the first step is mapping, mapping the path.
**Bclymer**: The second step is using the golden tools.
**Bclymer**: Which strategies are we going to use to, to, to get to that point?
**Bclymer**: And the third path is embarking on that quest.
**Bclymer**: How do we implement those strategies to get to that goal?
**Bclymer**: And those are the steps through the golden path that I've created in order to get to that goal of, well, we really want to save 90%.
**Bclymer**: Let's say we do this and we save 80%.
**Bclymer**: Well, guess what, that's a huge win.
**Bclymer**: You know, and part of this process is, okay, does Brandon understand it?
**Bclymer**: What questions does Brandon have?
**Bclymer**: And then does it make sense for you to do it?
**Bclymer**: Because we've got to look at the investment, we've got to look at the return on your investment and how long does it take you to get there?
**Bclymer**: And what we do is a five year projection to say, okay, this in five years.
**Bclymer**: If I said he's going to use the white glove maintenance service for every single month he's going to, we're Going to put this in place for him and use the step ladder.
**Bclymer**: This is what the investment would be.
**Bclymer**: And then we give you that ROI over that five year period.
**Bclymer**: And it only gets better if you know, because we're not going to force you to use our service for maintenance.
**Bclymer**: But after a year or two you understand how to use it and you can do it yourself, more likely than not.
**Bclymer**: And then instead of a white glove package, you roll down to a smaller package.
**Bclymer**: That way you can just ask questions and we still do the tax terms.
**Bclymer**: You see what I mean?
**Daniel**: So one, one thing in, in reading this and looking at it, and as I've done different research, different people are going to say this doesn't exist.
**Daniel**: Like there is no code for it.
**Daniel**: Like you're going to go to prison.
**Daniel**: So can you like I guess give me examples of you doing this or whatever this system and it going up in court and winning?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, of course.
**Bclymer**: So you know, there was a memo that was written in August of 23 by the IRS.
**Bclymer**: And if you read the memo, number one, it says you can't use this for precedence.
**Bclymer**: But what happened was there were some bad actors.
**Bclymer**: And the way that I explained this is this right here.
**Bclymer**: A conservation easement is a great thing unless you go out and syndicate it.
**Bclymer**: And if it's not your land then.
**Avelina**: It could be a problem.
**Bclymer**: So just like anything else, these people used a structure kinda like what I have.
**Bclymer**: I have a business trust and a family trust.
**Bclymer**: They had business trust, family trust, charitable trust and a private family foundation.
**Bclymer**: They would run the money all the way down through the private family foundation and then rent and then lease and then loan the money back up to the family trust.
**Bclymer**: We can't do that.
**Bclymer**: That breaks some of the rules when it comes to self healing.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, that if you search the word self dealing it will come up like you'll get a bunch of info about family foundations.
**Mcalcetero**: Like they invented that term to describe what these guys were doing.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, it's.
**Bclymer**: And it's when you have a bad actor, the promoters were indicted and you know, they're more than likely going to go to jail.
**Bclymer**: But the companies that I use to do this have been in business for 30 plus years.
**Bclymer**: I've got a zero change audit letter, I've got a, a private letter ruling that essentially says the extraordinary dividends when it moves from the business trust to the business, excuse me, from the business trust to the family trust.
**Bclymer**: That movement is allowed number one.
**Bclymer**: And then number two, when it lands in that family trust, it's non taxable okay.
**Bclymer**: Code section 643 specifically talks about extraordinary dividends and capital gains in relation to how it can be non taxable as well.
**Bclymer**: And the goal is for it not to distribute to the beneficiaries.
**Bclymer**: Now these are what we call discretionary.
**Bclymer**: So it's to the discretion of you to either distribute or not.
**Bclymer**: There are some trusts that are discretionary.
**Bclymer**: For example, the business trust is non discretionary.
**Bclymer**: So you can't pick or choose.
**Bclymer**: You must give it back down to the beneficiary.
**Avelina**: While on the other hand, the business.
**Bclymer**: The family trust, is discretionary.
**Bclymer**: So you can choose if you want to or not.
**Bclymer**: And so we just make sure we tick all the marks.
**Bclymer**: Like for example, if this were a grantor trust, then it would have no tax benefits, it would have asset protection benefits, but not tax benefits.
**Bclymer**: So we make sure that you're not the grantor.
**Avelina**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And the way I do that, the.
**Daniel**: Grant tour is the person controlling it.
**Bclymer**: The grantor is the person who starts the trust and opens the trust and funds the trust.
**Daniel**: Okay.
**Daniel**: So we would use a law firm or something.
**Bclymer**: So we use me.
**Bclymer**: I'm the one that starts it and I'm the one that funds it.
**Avelina**: Right.
**Bclymer**: So what I'll do is this is.
**Bclymer**: So this is sort of the pathway of how we do it.
**Bclymer**: We get an attorney involved and we get what we call a Covel agreement.
**Bclymer**: Covell agreement says that the attorney hires you.
**Bclymer**: Hire the attorney, the attorney hires me.
**Bclymer**: Now I'm under the client attorney privilege of the attorney.
**Bclymer**: And now no one can come to me and force me to talk to them through like a lawsuit.
**Bclymer**: Very important that we do it that way.
**Bclymer**: So once we get in that Covale.
**Avelina**: Then.
**Bclymer**: You pay, you pay us.
**Bclymer**: We get the trusts and I create the trusts and then I'll create, I'll have a, like a bank teller check that I'll send to you in the documentation where that is what you use to deposit into the trust to start the bank account.
**Bclymer**: And now that that money starts the bank account, the bank account is initially funded.
**Bclymer**: Now that that bank account is initially funded and I'm the one that created it, I resign and I give all rights over to the trustee, the initial trustee.
**Bclymer**: So you have a grantor person who sets it up.
**Bclymer**: Then you have the trust administrator that is also known as the protector, and that person is over the trustee.
**Bclymer**: So you have the, the protector and then you have the trustee.
**Bclymer**: And the trustee controls the trust.
**Bclymer**: So it controls everything inside the trust, the funds inside the trust.
**Bclymer**: And the goal is the Trust is there for the benefit of the beneficiaries, okay?
**Bclymer**: So we want to make sure that that trustee is fiduciary responsible.
**Bclymer**: So for example, if there's a loan that goes from the family trust to you, when you have it collateralized, how do you have it collateralized?
**Bclymer**: You have a collateralized through life insurance.
**Avelina**: Okay?
**Bclymer**: So there again we use some of the things that you have already, like the whole life policy as a benefit in order to make sure that, that you can borrow money from the trust.
**Bclymer**: Because now the loan is collateralized, of course you have to pay interest rates and all that kind of stuff because it has to be no self dealing, it has to be arm's length, right?
**Bclymer**: So all of those things are how we help you make sure that that's done, right?
**Bclymer**: So we do the paper, we make sure all the loans are actually documented.
**Bclymer**: We help make sure anything that you buy or sell into the trust, we have all the paper for, we help you with the demand notes, all that kind of stuff.
**Bclymer**: And so after the trusts come back to you, you have that initial check there to fund it.
**Bclymer**: Everything is documented.
**Bclymer**: Now we know that you are not the grantor.
**Bclymer**: I actually had that come up in an audit where those bad actors, the bad actors had a lot of trust set up.
**Bclymer**: And I, I have about two dozen clients that are those bad actors trusts and we've had to go through and clean them all up.
**Bclymer**: And one of them is under audit right now.
**Bclymer**: And the question was, this document says that you received a desk and a chair in order to fund the trust.
**Bclymer**: A desk and chair?
**Avelina**: Where is the desk and chair?
**Bclymer**: That was the question from the auditor.
**Bclymer**: Where is it now?
**Bclymer**: Where is it housed?
**Bclymer**: Send me a picture of it.
**Mcalcetero**: Plot to a movie about a devious desk and chair that has to be found.
**Mcalcetero**: Better call Indiana Jones.
**Bclymer**: So, so, I mean, Brandon, at the end of the day there we, we all know that there is no desk and chair, right?
**Bclymer**: But, so what we've done is we've put things in place to make sure that we can prove that Brandon did not start these accounts and Brandon didn't fund the accounts.
**Bclymer**: Once the initial accounts are funded, then you can go and open more accounts because you're the trustee.
**Bclymer**: You can do what you need to do to have the best interest of the trust in place.
**Bclymer**: But that's how we do it.
**Bclymer**: Now we do have a zero change letter, we do have an opinion letter, we do have a private letter ruling that shows that the extraordinary dividends are non taxable and can be moved down.
**Bclymer**: So Those are the things that we have.
**Bclymer**: I do have a private letter ruling that is in the, in the ether out there, sort of waiting on the irs.
**Bclymer**: Hopefully in the next year we'll get that back and you know, that way they will understand exactly what the step ladder is and how it works and what it does.
**Bclymer**: So hopefully we'll have that back, let's say, in the next year.
**Bclymer**: We'll see.
**Daniel**: So in this.
**Daniel**: So, okay, so we set up the paper, you know, I give you whatever, 10 grand, let's say, to start the family trust.
**Daniel**: So now the, the family trust has money in it.
**Daniel**: It's there.
**Daniel**: Okay.
**Daniel**: And then from that we, we've done a, whatever the valuation and the guy comes back and says, all right, you know, 50, let's say, say 50 of your profits could be the, the brain child of Brandon, right?
**Daniel**: So, you know, let's say a half a million dollars, you know, at the end of the year, you know, we look at our books, a half a million dollars can move there.
**Daniel**: Okay?
**Daniel**: So it goes from Alito to that family trust.
**Daniel**: A half a million bucks is sitting there.
**Daniel**: Now that half a million, once it's in there, that trust entity does not pay any taxes.
**Daniel**: It's tax deferred, correct?
**Bclymer**: That's correct, yeah.
**Daniel**: And how long is it deferred for in perpetuity?
**Bclymer**: And that's when we really get into what we call secession planning.
**Bclymer**: So what happens when Brandon gets hit by a bus?
**Bclymer**: I don't know if you're married, but what happens if Brandon's spouse, what happens if she gets hit by a bus?
**Bclymer**: So there's a way that we make sure that any of the beneficiaries, they become the trustee.
**Bclymer**: So we move them from.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so you've got, you've got the protector, trust administrator, you've got the trustee, and then below that you've got the beneficiary.
**Bclymer**: So what happens is this beneficiary, once you and your wife get hit by a bus, they become the trust administrator and the trustee.
**Avelina**: Okay?
**Bclymer**: So what happens is now they can continue down the line and there's no money moved to them.
**Bclymer**: Now if they decide, hey, I want my share, then they're just going to pay tax on, you know, right?
**Bclymer**: And that's, that's their choice.
**Avelina**: Right?
**Daniel**: And so, all right, so the money moves to the family trust.
**Daniel**: It's.
**Daniel**: It's done now.
**Daniel**: And then me, it's like, hey, I need some walking around money.
**Daniel**: I want to go buy some shit.
**Daniel**: Like I am going to do a loan to get pull the money out, you know, whatever.
**Daniel**: I'm going to take 200 grand out of that.
**Daniel**: And then since that is a loan, that is debt and I'm not paying taxes on the debt.
**Daniel**: Correct?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, but you just have to pay the interest on it on a quarterly basis or something like that.
**Daniel**: But I could do interest only payments or something like that, Right?
**Daniel**: Or principal interest.
**Bclymer**: Yep, you can do principal.
**Bclymer**: You can do interest only if you choose.
**Daniel**: Okay, Yeah.
**Daniel**: I mean, there's no reason not to, I wouldn't think.
**Daniel**: But at the end of the day, that's still.
**Daniel**: I'm putting the money back in there, plus interest and just pulling out another loan as needed.
**Daniel**: Kicking the can down.
**Avelina**: Yep.
**Daniel**: And then, so with that, okay, so I've moved money in there, like, and I want to buy it another company.
**Daniel**: I buy that through the family trust or I have to use the business trust, which.
**Daniel**: The business trust is taxed.
**Daniel**: Correct.
**Bclymer**: So it is.
**Bclymer**: It is taxed.
**Bclymer**: However, the way it works is if you have $100,000 come in, you have $100,000 go out.
**Bclymer**: So it's a zero tax.
**Bclymer**: There's no net.
**Daniel**: There's no profit.
**Bclymer**: That's right.
**Bclymer**: There's no profit.
**Daniel**: Okay, so.
**Daniel**: Okay, I see.
**Daniel**: Because from the business trust, it goes to the family trust.
**Bclymer**: Well, that's right.
**Bclymer**: So it goes.
**Bclymer**: Here, I'll show you again.
**Bclymer**: Maybe I should have left that up.
**Daniel**: Okay, so, yeah, dividend.
**Avelina**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So here this is sort of the control structure and the cash flow at the same time.
**Bclymer**: So when the money rolls into the business, let's say $100,000 moves from the business to the business trust, then you'll have $100,000 move out as the extraordinary dividend into the family trust, which then.
**Daniel**: In turn the extraordinary.
**Bclymer**: Which nets.
**Bclymer**: Which nets.
**Bclymer**: This is zero.
**Daniel**: Okay.
**Daniel**: And then so from the family trust, that's where I see, like I'm buying more assets.
**Avelina**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: So let's say that you wanted to buy.
**Bclymer**: Let's say the trust wanted to invest in a home in Reno or Tahoe.
**Avelina**: Right.
**Bclymer**: So the trust would just purchase the home in Tahoe.
**Bclymer**: So here's here.
**Bclymer**: You know, we talked about a little bit earlier about the pros and cons.
**Bclymer**: Let me give you a big con here.
**Bclymer**: You ready?
**Avelina**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: There is so much asset protection built into this trust that banks do not.
**Avelina**: Like to lend it money, period.
**Bclymer**: So even if you have a home that has a 50% loan to value, they don't like to give you 50% of the value because it is so hard for the bank to go in and repo that home and claw that home back out if there were no payment because there's so much strength in the asset protection.
**Avelina**: Okay?
**Bclymer**: So anything that we put in, we want to make sure that.
**Bclymer**: Let's say that you have a second home, okay?
**Avelina**: And let's say it's free and clear.
**Bclymer**: If you wanted a loan off of that home, then you get the loan in your name before you move it into the home, move it into the family trust.
**Bclymer**: And then what you do is Brandon will sell that home into the family trust, and Brandon receives what we call a demand note.
**Bclymer**: And now you have that demand note.
**Bclymer**: That demand note essentially says, hey.
**Avelina**: You.
**Bclymer**: Can accrue interest on this, but don't pay me the interest until I demand that the trust gives me money.
**Bclymer**: Okay?
**Bclymer**: So now let's say that that home is worth, you know, $500,000.
**Bclymer**: That demand note is worth $500,000.
**Bclymer**: You could go in and say, okay, I demand that you give me $200,000.
**Bclymer**: Now that $200,000 that you receive is not taxable because you sold that asset in.
**Bclymer**: And then what is taxable is that interest on that $500,000 note.
**Bclymer**: So let's say that interest at, you know, 5% is what, $25,000 a year.
**Bclymer**: And let's say that it goes three years.
**Bclymer**: Now there's $75,000 worth of interest that Brandon is owed inside that demand note.
**Bclymer**: If you go and pull $100,000 off of it, it pays you the 75, all of the accrued interest, and then it pays you the 100.
**Bclymer**: And now Brandon has tax on $75,000 worth of interest income.
**Avelina**: Okay?
**Bclymer**: And you have a $400,000 open demand note.
**Bclymer**: And now you're going to receive interest income on that $400,000 until the demand note is paid in full.
**Daniel**: Right.
**Daniel**: It's like a home equity line.
**Bclymer**: That's exactly right.
**Bclymer**: That's paying Brandon every single month or quarter or whatever.
**Bclymer**: And that's one of the ways that we pull money out of the trust when you decide to retire and you're just going to pay taxes on the interest income.
**Daniel**: So like we, we.
**Daniel**: I mean, our business, it's a design build firm is what Alito does.
**Daniel**: And so I don't have a ton of assets.
**Daniel**: We don't self perform.
**Daniel**: So I don't have a ton of heavy equipment or anything like that.
**Daniel**: I have some vehicles, but, you know, you're talking, you know, 400,000 in vehicles, maybe, maybe five, you know, not a ton.
**Daniel**: Yeah, so, but those would be assets.
**Daniel**: I would move and then lease.
**Daniel**: Correct?
**Bclymer**: You could.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, you could.
**Bclymer**: One of the things that I did was I moved my personal house into my trust and now my trust has to pay for it.
**Avelina**: That way.
**Bclymer**: I mean, you think random.
**Daniel**: I've got, I've got a mortgage on my house.
**Avelina**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: You think about how much money you spend on your house and how much money you would not have to spend.
**Bclymer**: Now the trust is going to spend the money on the house and it's pre tax.
**Avelina**: Right.
**Bclymer**: So your money's going to go much further.
**Bclymer**: But when you think about the money that you spend on your house on a monthly basis and now you don't have to spend that money, you understand that your W2 is going to go 10 times further.
**Bclymer**: You see what I mean?
**Avelina**: Yep.
**Daniel**: Yeah.
**Daniel**: And just so in general, every.
**Daniel**: Everything.
**Daniel**: So like, I guess.
**Daniel**: Yeah.
**Daniel**: Because once I can able to start to pull loans out, you know, like I just went to Cancun last week, like I could put all that on my personal credit card and it really doesn't matter because I'm using that money just as if it were.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Avelina**: And.
**Bclymer**: And that's entertainment.
**Bclymer**: That's fun.
**Bclymer**: So the trust can't pay for that anyway.
**Bclymer**: So that's going to.
**Bclymer**: I mean, you think about it, your W2 was if it's not going to be paying for your home now, it's just going to be saved and you can go to Cancun from your W2.
**Bclymer**: You know, it's not really a big deal.
**Bclymer**: And here's the other thing too.
**Bclymer**: You have control.
**Bclymer**: So I would tell you, instead of you pulling it out of the trust, you just pull it out of your business and pay tax on it.
**Bclymer**: It's easier that way.
**Bclymer**: We want to keep everything in the trust.
**Bclymer**: In the trust.
**Daniel**: What I was talking about is I take a loan me against that.
**Daniel**: And then Now I've got 200 grand in my bank account so I can use, you know, my personal funds at that.
**Bclymer**: Anything you need to.
**Avelina**: Yep, yep.
**Bclymer**: Exactly right.
**Bclymer**: So let's talk about next steps.
**Bclymer**: I know we're close to the top of the hour, so next steps for me is I.
**Bclymer**: I always like to talk to people about, number one, the investigation and the goal crystallization.
**Bclymer**: Because I don't want to go in and spend a lot of time on projections unless you're interested in the, in using the strategy, you know, because I don't charge for doing the projections and things like that.
**Bclymer**: I want to make sure that you're like, yeah, let's move forward.
**Bclymer**: Because if I'm Going to spend, you know, two or three hours doing the projections.
**Bclymer**: I don't necessarily want to do it for somebody that's not going to say, well, I'm interested in taking the next step.
**Daniel**: So.
**Bclymer**: And so that's, that's where we are.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, there is.
**Daniel**: This is something I'm, I'm interested in for sure.
**Daniel**: And don't take offense to this.
**Daniel**: I would like you to send me the, the actual cases and the letters that you've referenced.
**Daniel**: Just because that's my biggest thing is, like, I have to know for a ma.
**Daniel**: Like, shadow of it out, like here it is black and white, like, completely understand it.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, no problem.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, no problem at all.
**Bclymer**: And so what I'll do is I'll send that to Sablini and he'll send it over to you.
**Bclymer**: We're going to make sure that Sablini's in this the entire full way.
**Bclymer**: We'll go on and talk to Sablini about what we need to get from you.
**Bclymer**: Last three years of corporate tax returns and individual tax returns.
**Bclymer**: That's the start.
**Bclymer**: There may be some more things that we need.
**Bclymer**: P Ls for 2025, balance sheet for 2025 for your company.
**Mcalcetero**: Do you have a P Ls?
**Mcalcetero**: They don't necessarily have balance sheets, but Maria, we can plug in any gaps after this if we need to.
**Mcalcetero**: Because I was looking at the file.
**Daniel**: We have a balance sheet.
**Mcalcetero**: Oh, you have a balance sheet.
**Mcalcetero**: I'm saying I don't have it in my file.
**Mcalcetero**: I'm looking at what I have and I have P Ls, but not a balance sheet.
**Mcalcetero**: No, you, you definitely, your bookkeepers do a good job on your books.
**Mcalcetero**: So they're definitely going to have a balance sheet for us.
**Mcalcetero**: But like I said, I'll.
**Mcalcetero**: After this call, I can coordinate with Maria and fill in any gaps, Brandon, so you don't have to wor.
**Daniel**: Yeah, we just had it.
**Daniel**: We just got done with the financial audit too, so that should have everything.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, so I've got like, there's a couple tax turn gaps.
**Mcalcetero**: Love to film.
**Mcalcetero**: Like, I have some personal stuff, some corporate stuff, but not necessarily all three years of both.
**Mcalcetero**: So again, we'll just, we'll plug in the gaps, Benny, and we know what to do here.
**Avelina**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And then, and then.
**Bclymer**: So what we'll do is once we get that it'll take us, let's say, two weeks to get the projections done, we meet again, talk about any questions that you may have on the information that I send you, number one, and then number Two, we'll talk about investment and return on your investment.
**Bclymer**: Hold on.
**Bclymer**: Yards, is that okay?
**Avelina**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: All right, good.
**Avelina**: All right, wonderful.
**Bclymer**: Well, we.
**Bclymer**: It's great to meet you.
**Avelina**: You too.
**Daniel**: I.
**Daniel**: By the way, what camera do you use?
**Daniel**: Because I noticed that it allows you to look directly straight versus so many of them.
**Daniel**: Like, your eyes don't connect.
**Bclymer**: So this is a studio in my home, and I have to really train because I'm looking into a teleprompter right now, and I have my computer down in front of me right here.
**Bclymer**: And it's pretty cool because, like, taking a page from the politician book, I can switch it over and I could write something right here if I wanted to and.
**Bclymer**: And literally pop it back up right there.
**Bclymer**: So it's a.
**Bclymer**: It's a system that I made.
**Bclymer**: I.
**Bclymer**: I'm starting my podcast hopefully in the next month or so.
**Daniel**: Nice.
**Bclymer**: And that's why.
**Bclymer**: That's why I did this.
**Bclymer**: But I've got the teleprompter and a rebel 35 millimeter digital camera up there, and I've got lighting and all that kind of stuff.
**Bclymer**: If you're interested in.
**Bclymer**: In this setup, I'm more than happy to.
**Bclymer**: To give you a referral.
**Daniel**: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'd be interested.
**Daniel**: I'm like, most of us send a ton of time on these cameras, so.
**Avelina**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And the pretty cool thing is like.
**Bclymer**: Like, watch it.
**Bclymer**: Just watch this.
**Bclymer**: Check this out.
**Bclymer**: I know.
**Bclymer**: I know that we gotta go, but check this out.
**Bclymer**: This is my webcam.
**Daniel**: Oh, wow.
**Bclymer**: So this is.
**Mcalcetero**: Big difference.
**Bclymer**: This is an 85 inch TV behind me.
**Avelina**: Right.
**Bclymer**: This is my.
**Bclymer**: This is my webcam.
**Bclymer**: And so just look at my face and how it's sort of washed out a little bit now.
**Bclymer**: Check this out.
**Daniel**: Oh, yeah.
**Daniel**: It's way cool.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, I wouldn't mind a referral on that because I.
**Mcalcetero**: My office is packed up in the.
**Mcalcetero**: In the moving box.
**Mcalcetero**: It'll be here in a couple of weeks.
**Mcalcetero**: I just moved.
**Mcalcetero**: FYI.

**Avelina**: To you too.
