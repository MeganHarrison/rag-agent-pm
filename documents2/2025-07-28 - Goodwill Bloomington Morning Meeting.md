**Jcurtin**: Hey.

**Jdawson**: Good.
**Jdawson**: Moving some things for the flooring guys right now.
**Jcurtin**: It's going good.

**Jdawson**: Framers will be framing, hanging drywall up in the donation vestibule.
**Jdawson**: Sidewalk is supposed to be poured today.
**Jcurtin**: Sidewalks at the entrance?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, at the entrance.
**Jdawson**: Rick's also going to put some concrete on the opening and the donation vestibule so that we can install the door on Wednesday.
**Jdawson**: More CSE trim out.
**Jcurtin**: Did you.
**Jcurtin**: Do you know what size that door needs to be the opening for it?
**Jdawson**: Hold on, hold on one second.
**Jdawson**: Guy said something.
**Jcurtin**: Dad need to look.
**Ksipe**: Log off or something.
**Jcurtin**: He's.
**Jcurtin**: He said he needed to talk to the flooring contractor quick, but it looks like he.
**Jcurtin**: He logged off.
**Jcurtin**: Not sure if he's gonna log on or not.
**Ksipe**: But I talked to him earlier.
**Ksipe**: And jdawson been an email Friday late to me and Brandon, he's asking for photos of the canopy that he wants to send to the landlord.
**Ksipe**: So I looked online.
**Ksipe**: There was a couple photos.
**Ksipe**: I don't know how recent progress is, but on job planner, so I just asked Jack to get a couple of those.
**Ksipe**: And are we settled on the framer, EFIs, window guy, all that, or is that still an issue?
**Jcurtin**: The window guy, he said that he might be able to.
**Jcurtin**: He wanted us to reach out to their superintendent to see if we can get on the schedule.
**Jcurtin**: But if not, then we'll have to just pay for them to come out on a Saturday.
**Jcurtin**: So I want Jack to talk to the superintendent today, see if he can get something scheduled.
**Jcurtin**: If not, then we'll just schedule them for a Saturday.
**Ksipe**: Did we have it in writing where they said we're going to deliver them on the 18th of mid August?
**Jcurtin**: I don't think so.
**Ksipe**: Another thing I need you to research and make sure that we're not messing up by not putting stone on the bottom of those columns.
**Ksipe**: Especially if it was on the permit drawings that the city could come back and ding us for.
**Jcurtin**: Oh, you said you want me to.
**Ksipe**: Research it, but find out if we're going to be required to put a different material at the base of those columns.
**Jcurtin**: With Goodwill or with the city?
**Ksipe**: The city.
**Ksipe**: The city.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Ksipe**: Is there something in there?
**Ksipe**: They're whatever that has to.
**Ksipe**: Does it just need to be a different color efis stick out a little further or does it need to be an actual different material?
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, I'll reach out to that guy when we.
**Jcurtin**: That we talk to the windows.
**Ksipe**: The architect the other architect.
**Jcurtin**: You said you wanted me to reach out to the city.
**Ksipe**: Well, you can if you have to, but like, I'm just saying, either between that architect that did the drawings or if you need to call up the city to confirm, but if you just can find out before you call the city up, it can make all kinds of up.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, okay, I'll.
**Jcurtin**: I'll reach out to that architect first and see what he says.
**Jcurtin**: And then if he wants us to talk to the city, then I'll reach out to the city.
**Ksipe**: Yeah, just talk to him.
**Ksipe**: Ask him, hey, if we make these just a different color ethus, or do you think there's something that they would make us actually put brick on and.
**Ksipe**: Because definitely.
**Ksipe**: Especially since it's on the permit drawing.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: Oh, one other thing.
**Jcurtin**: The beam at the loading dock.
**Jcurtin**: The mason said he's not able to put like a CMU veneer on the side.
**Jcurtin**: He said it's not going to hold.
**Jcurtin**: So I'm thinking we just painted that beam.
**Ksipe**: He's not able to infill the web of the beam.
**Jcurtin**: He said it's too tall.
**Jcurtin**: He said when he does that, normally the beam is smaller than the size of a block, but this is larger.
**Ksipe**: Which side?
**Ksipe**: Just the one across the o.
**Ksipe**: The top of the opening or the one at the.
**Ksipe**: The actual.
**Jcurtin**: He said the only place that he can put block that he thinks it will actually hold is just putting it on the top of the beam.
**Jcurtin**: But on the sides.
**Jcurtin**: He says he can't do it.
**Ksipe**: I know, but is it just one beam?
**Ksipe**: Isn't there a beam above the.
**Ksipe**: The.
**Ksipe**: The loading dock door?
**Ksipe**: And then is there a beam on the top or just the one at the loading dock?
**Jcurtin**: The one at the loading dock that is exposed.
**Jcurtin**: I'm gonna pull up the drawings.
**Jcurtin**: It's this one, this beam.
**Ksipe**: And what's the height of that beam?
**Jcurtin**: Top of steel.
**Jcurtin**: 18 foot.
**Jcurtin**: Well, 19 foot.
**Ksipe**: So that goes directly under the bar joist.
**Jcurtin**: This is like out exposed in the.
**Jcurtin**: In the open.
**Ksipe**: Sa.
**Jcurtin**: It's going to be like that.
**Ksipe**: And there's masonry above it.
**Jcurtin**: No, there's not.
**Ksipe**: So it's all the way at the top.
**Jcurtin**: Not all the way at the top.
**Jcurtin**: The top of the building is.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: It is at the top.
**Jcurtin**: The top of steel is the same height as the top of wall.
**Jcurtin**: There's a plate that goes in.
**Jcurtin**: In the block on this side, and then there's another plate that goes on the block on this side.
**Jcurtin**: And it sits on top of those plates.
**Jcurtin**: I guess it ties the walls together.
**Ksipe**: Well, it's got to support the roof bar joists like once.
**Ksipe**: Like those joists are supported by the end of them.
**Ksipe**: So they're going to sit on that and then you're going to have the gutter system and all that.
**Ksipe**: So you'll have to do EFIS or something to infill that beam.
**Ksipe**: You can't just leave the exposed beam or you're gonna get water in the building.
**Jcurtin**: Could you?
**Jcurtin**: Episode?
**Ksipe**: I don't know what else you would do.
**Jcurtin**: You think if we just cocked where it.
**Ksipe**: Where it can't have a bit.
**Ksipe**: You can't have a beam that's got basically creating a ledge on top of cmu.
**Ksipe**: There's just no way to waterproof that.
**Jcurtin**: Okay, I'll get with the egress guy.
**Ksipe**: Okay.
**Ksipe**: You know, they may have to shoot blocking in there too.
**Ksipe**: I don't know if that gutter is supported by, you know, the.
**Ksipe**: I don't know how it's hungry.
**Ksipe**: You have to have something possibly solid in there to hold together.
**Jcurtin**: Usually the top course of block is solid.
**Ksipe**: Well, there's no course a block along that where that beam's going.
**Ksipe**: It's just a beam.
**Ksipe**: She may have to shoot some plywood to the beam and then APIs, you know, plywood sheathing, EFAS over that.
**Ksipe**: So there's something solid in there.
**Ksipe**: How wide is the beam?
**Ksipe**: Is it the full width?
**Ksipe**: What does it call it out?
**Jcurtin**: I don't think it calls it out, but it's on the sharp drawings.
**Ksipe**: Okay, where's the shop drawings?
**Ksipe**: Can you zoom in?
**Ksipe**: Zoom into the beam.
**Ksipe**: What does it call it out as?
**Ksipe**: Go down.
**Ksipe**: Like it's a 10 by.
**Ksipe**: So is 10 inch.
**Ksipe**: Go up.
**Ksipe**: What does it call the beam out as?
**Ksipe**: Nick, right there.
**Ksipe**: Zoom in.
**Ksipe**: It's a 10 by 12.
**Ksipe**: Well, it.
**Jcurtin**: That doesn't mean 10 inches by 12 inches.
**Ksipe**: That's like 10 inch by 12 pounds a foot.
**Ksipe**: So the web is 10 inches.
**Ksipe**: We don't know what the flange is.
**Ksipe**: The width is 4 inches.
**Ksipe**: So it's only.
**Ksipe**: So the top width of the flange is only 3 and 9.
**Ksipe**: 16.
**Ksipe**: So 4 and 3.96.
**Ksipe**: So it's a 4.4inch wide on the top.
**Ksipe**: So your block's 10 inches.
**Ksipe**: So if you think about it, you're not going to have like it's not going to.
**Ksipe**: It's going to be inside the block.
**Ksipe**: So on one side or the other.
**Ksipe**: But you should have room to shoot some block in there because at that width, like a 2x4 shot to the inside of the beam.
**Ksipe**: Flip the web of the beam, and then you can plywood across the front of that.
**Ksipe**: And then they can do.
**Ksipe**: You can just check with the EFIS guy.
**Ksipe**: If he can do a mesh over that and finish, then it's a solid, solid system there.
**Ksipe**: So.
**Ksipe**: Okay, that'll work.
**Ksipe**: Just have him do that.
**Ksipe**: That's the cleanest way to get it done.
**Ksipe**: I asked her about that early on.
**Ksipe**: She's like, oh, no, I'll just infill it.
**Ksipe**: But I get it.
**Ksipe**: It blocks only 10 inches tall.
**Ksipe**: You can't have, like, little piece.
**Ksipe**: Couple small pieces in there.
**Jcurtin**: That's all I have for today.
**Ksipe**: Okay.
**Ksipe**: All right, Nick, I'm gonna jump on this other meeting right there.
