## Transcript
**Sclevenger**: Hey.
**Cmortensen**: Hey, Glendon.
**Bclymer**: Howdy.
**Cmortensen**: How are you doing, sir?
**Sclevenger**: Pretty good.
**Bclymer**: How are you?
**Bclymer**: Hanging in there, man.
**Cmortensen**: It's good weather here in Indy.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, it's not terrible here.
**Cmortensen**: We have the.
**Cmortensen**: The live golf tournament here is actually, you know, 10 minutes from the Harvest Market in Carmel.
**Bclymer**: You going?
**Cmortensen**: I. I got invited.
**Cmortensen**: I'm not sure if I'm gonna go.
**Cmortensen**: Yeah, I'll be a game time decision.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Sclevenger**: Yeah.
**Cmortensen**: It's actually pretty reasonable.
**Cmortensen**: It's only like 50 bucks to get in which, you know, PGA Tour events, usually a lot more than that.
**Cmortensen**: So.
**Sclevenger**: Yeah.
**Cmortensen**: You know, Sean's going to be joining.
**Bclymer**: She might.
**Bclymer**: She might remember part way.
**Bclymer**: And I just saw her head the other way.
**Sclevenger**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: In the office.
**Bclymer**: So she might not be hopping on.
**Sclevenger**: Okay.
**Cmortensen**: Well, I have.
**Cmortensen**: I have two things on the agenda to cover.
**Sclevenger**: Okay.
**Cmortensen**: First one is, is our schedule.
**Cmortensen**: I. I think you joined the FedEx call a little bit late, but I basically told them with these added alleatogroup that Carmel added.
**Cmortensen**: And then above the windows they asked for.
**Cmortensen**: The final comment was limestone alleatogroup above the windows, which aren't cheap and takes a little time to get.
**Cmortensen**: So my masonry got pushed back to starting in the middle of September.
**Cmortensen**: Okay, let me share this with you.
**Cmortensen**: So I'm going to send this out.
**Cmortensen**: And I started actualizing the schedule here this morning after getting some.
**Cmortensen**: Some lead times figured out.
**Cmortensen**: And in the red you can see on Microsoft Project when I send this out, it marks kind of critical path to getting the job done.
**Cmortensen**: And originally the entrance wasn't now.
**Cmortensen**: Now it is.
**Cmortensen**: So.
**Cmortensen**: So that's.
**Cmortensen**: If you ever want to see like what pushes the schedule forward and back, look at the red on the Gantt chart.
**Sclevenger**: Okay.
**Cmortensen**: So that, that pushed me back to basically getting my turnover date that first week of October.
**Cmortensen**: We lost a couple weeks there.
**Cmortensen**: However, my.
**Cmortensen**: My interior finish date and our rough end has taken a little longer than expected.
**Cmortensen**: That's done here on 925 is where I'm at now.
**Cmortensen**: And so that.
**Cmortensen**: That still allows.
**Cmortensen**: It's a.
**Cmortensen**: About a week after what we told FedEx when they could get in there.
**Cmortensen**: But being that their scope is.
**Cmortensen**: Doesn't really necessarily overlap, like once we get that area cleaned out for them, I'm happy to have them go in there and start working.
**Cmortensen**: And we'll just.
**Cmortensen**: We'll do one final walk.
**Cmortensen**: Glendon, with FedEx.
**Cmortensen**: That way I'm off the hook.
**Cmortensen**: And in turn you're off the hook.
**Sclevenger**: Right.
**Cmortensen**: And say, hey, do you guys agree that this space is ready?
**Cmortensen**: They'll say, sure.
**Cmortensen**: And then Anything that they mark up or mess up from there is on them.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay, that sounds good.
**Cmortensen**: I'll make sure we get that scheduled here later in September.
**Bclymer**: Okay, sounds good.
**Cmortensen**: So that.
**Cmortensen**: Yeah, I'll PDF this and I'll send it to the whole team and make sure it gets in FedEx's hands.
**Bclymer**: I think they.
**Cmortensen**: Originally, they were trying to open up in November, Correct.
**Cmortensen**: That's what your lease said with them.
**Bclymer**: Can't remember.
**Bclymer**: I've got it here somewhere, but that might be right.
**Sclevenger**: But.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, that's probably.
**Bclymer**: That's probably right.
**Cmortensen**: Sounds about right.
**Cmortensen**: I just know.
**Cmortensen**: So we're gonna try and let them in there sooner.
**Cmortensen**: But, yeah, ultimately, we got to get our stuff done before they can get in there.
**Cmortensen**: It's hard.
**Cmortensen**: It's hard to plan for two months of city review.
**Sclevenger**: Right, Right.
**Sclevenger**: Okay.
**Cmortensen**: So that covers schedule.
**Cmortensen**: The next thing I want to chat about.
**Cmortensen**: And Sean and I think you're on the email had reached out.
**Cmortensen**: I have all my permit costs in, and it can't.
**Cmortensen**: And we state in our contract that's a reimbursable cost.
**Cmortensen**: So I'll share those receipts with you, and you'll see a change order for the permit cost.
**Cmortensen**: It came out to be, I think, just under three grand.
**Sclevenger**: Okay.
**Cmortensen**: And then I. I'm working on getting a contract to the mason.
**Cmortensen**: We.
**Cmortensen**: We.
**Cmortensen**: We just, like I said, got our pricing in for the alleatogroup yesterday, and it added a little cost.
**Cmortensen**: As far as the masonry goes, that was out of budget.
**Cmortensen**: So we do have a $10,000 contingency still built into the contract.
**Cmortensen**: So I'll get that typed up.
**Cmortensen**: And I just want to ask you guys, do you want me to pull from that contingency or just create a change order?
**Cmortensen**: That'll be up to you guys.
**Ahuettl**: Okay.
**Cmortensen**: Do you.
**Bclymer**: Have you found anything on addresses?
**Cmortensen**: I have not.
**Sclevenger**: Okay.
**Cmortensen**: I briefly spoke with Sean about it.
**Cmortensen**: Let me put it on.
**Cmortensen**: I'm gonna put it on my list.
**Cmortensen**: Glendon, to see if I can't run by the city today and ask them.
**Bclymer**: Okay, that works for me.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I'm hoping I might be able to get up there next Wednesday and take a look at your guys's progress.
**Bclymer**: So I think we've got a flight going up there next Wednesday.
**Bclymer**: So I'm gonna try to get on that and hopefully.
**Bclymer**: Hopefully check it out.
**Bclymer**: But other than that, I think, yeah, if you're working on addresses, then I'll talk to Sean about permit cost change order and masonry and figure out what we want to do on that and just give her a heads up that, that's coming.
**Cmortensen**: So I'll type it up.
**Cmortensen**: The lint.
**Cmortensen**: It's not much, but you know, it does, it does add cost, so.
**Cmortensen**: But that's why we have that contingency, right?
**Sclevenger**: Yeah, yeah.
**Cmortensen**: Let me know when you're coming up and we'll.
**Cmortensen**: We'll plan on a lunch or try and get something figured out.
**Cmortensen**: Okay, I'll make.
**Cmortensen**: Yeah, I'll make sure.
**Cmortensen**: I'll make sure I'm in town.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, if I, if I get my.
**Bclymer**: If I get a schedule worked out, then I'll let you know.
**Bclymer**: But I. I think right now I'm planning on.
**Bclymer**: Should be flying up next Wednesday morning and then I'll head out that afternoon sometime.
**Sclevenger**: Okay.
**Cmortensen**: You don't fly commercial, right?
**Cmortensen**: You got a nice.
**Sclevenger**: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Cmortensen**: That's always nice.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah, it is, it is.
**Cmortensen**: So will you come up?
**Cmortensen**: Just you or will.
**Bclymer**: No, we've got.
**Bclymer**: I don't know what the purpose for the trip is for the flight is exactly, but I know we've got some marketing people headed that way and anyway, they just let me know there was a flight going up.
**Bclymer**: So I said, I. I told them I'd like to be on it to look at.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, look at what all's going on.
**Bclymer**: So I don't.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I don't even know who's on it usually.
**Bclymer**: Usually I don't know who's on it till the day before.
**Bclymer**: And they send out the flight plan and I see all who's on it and then I get a good idea of where everybody's going to be going.
**Bclymer**: So it is, it is like we all share vehicles.
**Bclymer**: So I mean, everything in Carmel we have is right there.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: But if, if we're going to look at neighboring stores or something like that, then everybody's kind of tagging along or you hang out at the store till they're done or whatever.
**Bclymer**: So you got to kind of work around everybody's schedules.
**Bclymer**: But I imagine I'll.
**Bclymer**: I'll spend most of my time there at the store.
**Cmortensen**: Let me, you know, if you need a.
**Cmortensen**: Like a ride or anything like that, I'm happy to arrange one.
**Bclymer**: I'm.
**Bclymer**: I'm serious.
**Cmortensen**: And yeah, I'd love to meet as much as the team as possible in person.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah, I'll let you know as soon as I figure out what the schedule is and who I was gonna be on and on the flight and what we're doing.
**Bclymer**: I'll let you know.
**Bclymer**: And then works with your schedule.
**Sclevenger**: Cool.
**Bclymer**: If not, then that's fine too.
**Bclymer**: So we'll be.
**Bclymer**: We'll be up there again, I'm sure.
**Sclevenger**: So awesome.
**Sclevenger**: Okay.
**Cmortensen**: That's all I had then.
**Cmortensen**: Looking forward to it.
**Cmortensen**: Alex or Jesse, do you guys have anything?
**Bclymer**: Nope, I got nothing.
**Bclymer**: I'm here now.
**Bclymer**: Everybody's rocking and rolling.
**Bclymer**: I'm good.
**Cmortensen**: Alrighty, guys.
**Cmortensen**: I'll talk to you soon here, Glennon.
**Bclymer**: Sounds good.
**Bclymer**: Thank you, guys.
