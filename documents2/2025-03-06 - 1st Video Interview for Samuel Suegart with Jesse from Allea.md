**Mathew**: Hello.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: Good afternoon Mr.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: Dawson.
**Jdawson**: How are you?
**Mathew**: Yeah, sorry, I'm good.
**Mathew**: And I was driving and not at my computer so I had to download an app to use this meeting type for the meeting.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: But yeah, good.
**Mathew**: Now so I don't have your resume in front of me but I guess just start by telling me a little bit about yourself and your experience.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: Okay.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: So my name is Samuel.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: I'm 33 years old.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: I'm a civil engineer.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: I've worked well I come from Venezuela.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: I am now living in Argentina.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: In Venezuela I worked as a project engineer for two years for a company that was working with the government with the railway expansions.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: I had to review the drawings and specifications.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: Then I moved to Argentina back in 2017.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: I work in a company that again that worked for the government as a head estimator and assistant superintendent.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: We work installing storm drainage specific area in the city of Buenos Aires, Argentina.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: The capital storm drains storm whether if it's concrete or hpid.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: So that I learned a lot from public construction, if you will.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: After four years there I started working as a remote employee for a general contractor slash construction manager management company in Virginia.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: I've participated in three projects right now mostly construction management.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: One is located in Fort Lauderdale, one is located in.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: Two of them are located in DCs.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: So in those two I really focus on learning more about how to manage a project.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: Of course I had to do estimates and to review bids and get in touch with subcontractors.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: 50% of my time I have to be in the meetings meetings with the general contractor.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: Those I am.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: I have been handling these.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: These meetings for a little bit of time.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: Now I work directly with the president of the company.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: He will be like the project executive.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: I work in line with him and the project superintendent.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: But I've learned first.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: Well it was a challenge for me learning the new.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: The new system like the new quantities in the.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: I would say the American way if you will.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: So I had to take a one or two courses like to understand how estimating works in a different country.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: Then I had to get use how the system is there.
**Mathew**: Then when you say system like what they use for estimating.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: In Latin America.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: Centimeters, meters and kilograms.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: And it's sometimes I.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: I like to joke by saying like just take a number times 10 or 100 and then.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: Then you get to the next unit.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: Now.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: Yeah, if you have an inch 8 inches.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: Times 12.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: So that's something.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: Yeah.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: In my boss agrees.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: My God says sometimes that system can get a little bit complicated.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: Yeah, yeah.
**Mathew**: Now when you for estimating the way we estimate most everything.
**Mathew**: It's.
**Mathew**: It's not as much doing a bunch of takeoffs as it is finding the subcontractors, sending out the drawings or the plans or specs to them, and then following up, making sure they're getting us a price and, you know, answering any questions they have.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: Yeah.
**Mathew**: So.
**Mathew**: And then following up once they.
**Mathew**: The bids come back in, doing a bid comparison between them all.
**Mathew**: So is that a position that.
**Mathew**: Or is that activities you did at this last company, that.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: Those are activities I have to do regularly?
**Samuelsuegart.92**: Because we are managing a big build in D.C.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: and the owner is actively looking for small projects to perform.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: And we've actually undergone.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: We've actually underwent, sorry, three or four major construction.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: We did the garage, concrete repairs, lightweight repairs, with the renovation of the laundry rooms.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: So we had to review the drawings.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: We have to reach out to reputable firms or bidders.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: I noticed that I was asked if I know the software building connected.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: I've seen it.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: I don't really work with it.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: I would say we do it the old way.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: We have a.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: Every time we.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: We are happy with a subcontractor, we just put into one big spreadsheet that we have.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: So we know who to go when.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: We have a.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: When we're looking for different trades.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: So we reach out to them.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: We send them an email, send them to drawings, call them, see if they.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: If they can drop by the side and just see if they have any questions.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: They send RFIs.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: We review the RFIs.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: The ones that we are able to answer.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: We just answered some of them need the design team, whether it's the architect or the MEP or the structural engineer to weigh in a little bit because it's beyond at least my area of expertise.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: As to estimating.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: Yes.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: I use a software called Plan Swift to do my takeoffs.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: We honestly, I work with a.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: I would say an assistant.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: I have an assistant and we come up with the estimate together.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: It is ultimately reviewed by my boss.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: He says, well, I think the price is what I'm expecting.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: So we have that in the back of our head.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: So when we receive the bids, first, we know if they are a little bit over budget or if they are in line with what we're looking for, then we do.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: I mean, you reach out to 10 bidders, you hope to get five answers.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: Then you get.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: You hope to get at least three good bids that you can present to the, to the owner of the.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: Of the building.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: So that's pretty much how it goes.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: Yeah.
**Mathew**: We work all over the country and so, you know, we have a lot of subs near our offices like in Tampa, that's where I am.
**Mathew**: And Indianapolis, like.
**Mathew**: But when we're doing jobs in New Jersey or Texas or Tennessee or Utah, like then is when building connected, it's simply a resource.
**Mathew**: You go to that.
**Mathew**: Put it in a zip code area and you put the trades you're looking for and then it'll spit out a bunch of different subcontractors and then it's just a matter of calling them, seeing if they're qualified to do that type of work.
**Mathew**: We don't, you know, we have some projects coming up that require, you know, some of them a lot of civil and of that nature.
**Mathew**: But mostly we do commercial and warehouse type projects.
**Mathew**: So like that, that experience, you know, have you had a whole lot like with the drywall and the finishes and the painter and the roofer and.
**Jdawson**: You.
**Mathew**: Know, any mechanical, plumbing, electrical, all those companies that have to do all those rough ins, you know, have you had much experience estimating jobs of that nature?
**Samuelsuegart.92**: I would, I want to say some experience in that.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: I did talk with the lady that called me first that I'm not 100% of my time doing estimates, but I do have practical knowledge of reading and understanding the drawings and coming up with estimates and cost for material and labor that will be in line, what we've seen in the industry, at least in the DMV area.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: But I just, Yeah, I want to be honest that I'm basically looking to.
**Mathew**: Be a project manager.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: Yes.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: So I do have the basics of estimating and we've done quite a bit of takeoff and bid review for our, for the, for the owner of the project.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: That's.
**Mathew**: As a remote pm, what is it that you do?
**Mathew**: What do you take care of?
**Samuelsuegart.92**: So as remote PM I am.
**Jdawson**: Well.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: I have to, I'm going to say this without orders.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: I have to be very.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: I have to acknowledge that I understand all the scope of work that is required.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: I'm not really memorized, but to really understand where do I look for the answers?
**Samuelsuegart.92**: I mean, in what part of the drawing is this something that we need?
**Samuelsuegart.92**: Keeping track of the subcontractors and maintaining a schedule, doing the.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: Comparing the actual schedule versus their baseline contract schedule, reviewing the RFIs, distributing the RFIs to the appropriate person that needs to review that.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: Run meetings with the GCs, report to my boss, participate in meetings with the CEOs and the stakeholders for the project.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: Basically minute taking and following up after that and also helping with the.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: With the field team, with my assistant, my, my superintendent, whatever he needs.
**Mathew**: Whenever you do owner billings, do you do subcontractor billings?
**Samuelsuegart.92**: Well, this, this one that I'm working on is, is an owner building.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: The owner of this property is not a developer.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: So she has private funds and she's open to ideas on how to make her property more attractive to new leases.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: I think that her not being a developer, sometimes we need to be very clear and concise with the way that we're presenting the information to her.
**Mathew**: Because like you don't turn them.
**Mathew**: Do you like put together all your subcontractors, what they bill you each month and then you combine that and then you submit a bill to the owner.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: Or that's something else does.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: Actually since we are construction managers, what we do is we review each and every one of the requisitions, the G702 that each and every subcontractor bills for us.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: I would say the general contractor.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: Like we, we review what they're billing with us, we validate the change orders that arise in that month, then we present the pay app to the owner saying like we as construction managers certify that these requisition is legitimate, but our billing to the owner is just a fixed fee for construction manager slash construction administration services.
**Mathew**: Okay.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: Yes.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: So.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: Well, don't get me wrong.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: The company that I work with is GCS for small projects, but also does a lot of construction managers.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: I just happen to to be on the.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: On the CM side more than anything else.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Mathew**: All right, well, I mean we're looking for an estimator right now and so like you know, we got your information.
**Mathew**: If something comes up over looking for a pm, remote pm, you know, I'll get in touch with Matthew.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: Okay, I understand.
**Mathew**: Yeah, I appreciate, I appreciate your time.
**Mathew**: Yeah.
**Mathew**: And good luck with whatever you like.
**Mathew**: This, you know, construction is a great industry to get into, so.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: It is.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Mathew**: It's always going to be work.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Samuelsuegart.92**: Thank you so much for your time.
