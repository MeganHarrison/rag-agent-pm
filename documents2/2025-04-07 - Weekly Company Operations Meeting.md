**Dmacari**: That's where.
**Dmacari**: That's the same site?
**Dmacari**: Well, it's a different.
**Dmacari**: I mean it's right nearby.
**Dmacari**: That's where he's adding that hotel at.
**Dmacari**: Jesse.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Dmacari**: Told him about the.
**Dmacari**: The numbers based off the acreage and so he was excited for that.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Mcalcetero**: Seminole Collective Jesse so that one Andres.
**Njepson**: Updated a site plan today.
**Njepson**: Brandon sent that on to the owner.
**Njepson**: See what they think about that.
**Njepson**: He has asked us to wait to release design until he hears back from the city.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Dmacari**: He got back to me on the Performa.
**Dmacari**: So he's got 3 million plugged as you know, debt and that's without the, the parking lot and the buildings like the stuff the city would do.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Njepson**: When you say dad, if it's cost more than that, it doesn't work.
**Dmacari**: No, just not.
**Dmacari**: I mean, I don't know about that.
**Dmacari**: I.
**Dmacari**: I just.
**Dmacari**: He sent the performer and he didn't have debt servicing on there which is like, you know, when you do a performer it's a, you know, how much are you paying on your loan or whatever.
**Dmacari**: And so I asked him, I said what is your like I was looking through the.
**Dmacari**: I said what's your debt servicing number?
**Dmacari**: And he said 20,000amonth or you know, 3 million total is what I was looking at debt wise.
**Dmacari**: So I'm not saying it doesn't work if it's 3.2 or something like that, but that at least gives us a basis.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Mcalcetero**: Apply Engineer Office REMODEL AJ.
**Ataylor**: Yep.
**Ataylor**: We had a design meeting today, a review of the current permit set.
**Ataylor**: They are making some changes.

**Ataylor**: I have that number.
**Ataylor**: Once I get this construction set back I will be able to then submit it to the city.
**Ataylor**: I'll just use CDR number.
**Ataylor**: Really the critical thing for me to do is get a list of what the ads will be and then send that to applied.
**Ataylor**: Brandon, I was looking because I got a couple contracts I have to put together.
**Ataylor**: The only one I found in Collective was a PDF.
**Dmacari**: I'll send you a contract.
**Ataylor**: Well, is it this?
**Ataylor**: Is it this one?

**Dmacari**: So do you have a budget set on that yet?
**Ataylor**: Well, I do have a budget, but I'm.

**Dmacari**: That one's done.
**Dmacari**: Just waiting on ARCO to do their thing and then yeah, just find a bill.
**Mcalcetero**: So create.
**Mcalcetero**: So when it says create, change order, that's done too?
**Dmacari**: Yeah, just waiting on.
**Dmacari**: On Jim to get back to me so you can leave it open because it.
**Dmacari**: He hasn't responded yet, so technically it's still open.
**Mcalcetero**: So let's get in progress.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Dmacari**: Yep.
**Dmacari**: And then just need to send in final bill.
**Gducharme**: Awesome.
**Mcalcetero**: Westfield Collective.
**Mcalcetero**: Glenn.
**Bclymer**: Yep, there's my note.
**Bclymer**: Up late.
**Bclymer**: Got started out there today.
**Bclymer**: Drawings from both design teams were not submitted on time on Friday.
**Bclymer**: They still have been submitted today.
**Njepson**: Who's missing everything?
**Bclymer**: I mean.
**Bclymer**: Well, Mike, it turned in his stuff.
**Bclymer**: The plumbing and mechanical got turned in on Wednesday afternoon.
**Bclymer**: Or Thursday morning.
**Bclymer**: But Jeff and Nick both gave us answers on Friday that they wouldn't have it done by.
**Bclymer**: By the end of the day.
**Dmacari**: When's Jeff supposed to have his?
**Bclymer**: He said today, but I haven't heard anything from him.
**Bclymer**: I haven't spoken with him yet today.
**Bclymer**: But today it was also supposed to go to state.
**Bclymer**: Today was a CDR date.
**Njepson**: And you'd say you haven't spoken to him, you haven't been able to get a hold of him or.
**Bclymer**: I just, I just haven't.
**Bclymer**: I haven't been.
**Bclymer**: I haven't done it yet today.
**Bclymer**: I've been busy doing other stuff.
**Bclymer**: I haven't contacted him.
**Bclymer**: He told me he'd give it today.
**Bclymer**: I mean, that was Friday, so it's Monday here.
**Bclymer**: At the end of the day, did.
**Dmacari**: He email just you saying about those drawings, Jeff?
**Dmacari**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: No, he sent it to Jesse and I.
**Dmacari**: Why don't you respond to him right now and CC me as well and say, hey, Jeff, it's now 4pm on Monday.
**Dmacari**: Where are my drawings?
**Bclymer**: He's not.
**Bclymer**: He was supposed to give the owners elevations after we had our meeting here in person at the office as well.
**Bclymer**: And I've asked him I don't know how many times and it just.
**Bclymer**: He just doesn't respond.
**Bclymer**: He'll respond to other things in the email, but not that well.
**Dmacari**: So why don't you respond to him as you see me and say, hey, Jeff.
**Dmacari**: One, where are my drawings that were due Friday is now 4pm on Monday?
**Dmacari**: Two, where are the elevations that you're supposed to have three weeks ago?
**Dmacari**: You can CC his boss, Drew too.
**Dmacari**: JJ, what's Drew's email?
**Ataylor**: I'll forward it to you.
**Ataylor**: Glenn.
**Ataylor**: I had the same problem with Jeff with Crate, so he gets pretty busy.
**Ataylor**: So yeah, you need to bird dog his ass because if you don't, things will get missed.
**Ataylor**: Let me, let me find Drew Green and his name.
**Ataylor**: I'll forward it to you now.
**Dmacari**: Drew White.
**Ataylor**: Drew White, that's right.
**Ataylor**: Not Drew Green.
**Dmacari**: It's D.
**Dmacari**: White at Studio Access.
**Dmacari**: So you want, you want him on there?
**Dmacari**: Yes, you see him on there?
**Dmacari**: I just sent you a message in teams with his email.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, dy.
**Ataylor**: I knew it was one.
**Ataylor**: Some sort of color.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay, guys, moving along.
**Mcalcetero**: Goodwill, Corbell faces.
**Mcalcetero**: Nick.
**Mcalcetero**: Nick.
**Kjohnson**: We'Re waiting on the right of way permit.
**Njepson**: So.
**Njepson**: Nick, did you see the email today?
**Njepson**: The guy said he's approved it and go to the building department to look at getting a building permit.
**Njepson**: I think he was.
**Njepson**: He was with.
**Njepson**: See here, this guy's A senior planner.
**Njepson**: So just need to call the permit office and see if we can go get a permit and then have you let those subs just know it's coming up.
**Njepson**: I would contact them all since it's been a while.
**Njepson**: Once you have a call, find out about the permit and then let them both know.
**Njepson**: It's just the striper and the guy doing the concrete work.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Mcalcetero**: See that consulting building, Brandon?
**Dmacari**: Oh, well, hopefully Alex can get that figured out.
**Dmacari**: We still.
**Dmacari**: Yeah.
**Dmacari**: So around with clamps and stuff, so that job's turning into a shit show real quick.
**Mcalcetero**: Goodwill Bloomington.
**Kjohnson**: Nick, the utility department is reviewing the permit right now.
**Kjohnson**: Hopefully they'll have it back this week.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay, the rest is still not starting, right?
**Mcalcetero**: All these not started is still not started.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, those IU guys don't like moving quickly, do they, Nick?
**Gducharme**: No.
**Gducharme**: Okay, perfect.
**Mcalcetero**: We'll wait on that.
**Mcalcetero**: Aspire New for Reach.
**Mcalcetero**: Unique.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, we.
**Kjohnson**: We got the building final today, but I think we're done there after today.
**Mcalcetero**: What about price for CAT files?
**Mcalcetero**: Still waiting on that.
**Kjohnson**: I think they did send a price this week.
**Kjohnson**: I.
**Kjohnson**: I need to look at it.
**Njepson**: I sent back his proposal this morning, Nick.
**Njepson**: To the architect.
**Njepson**: I just need to get him an invoice.
**Njepson**: He needs to send us an invoice so that we can pay his retainer fee and get him started.
**Njepson**: Okay, but his price includes doing the survey and doing all that.
**Njepson**: We can turn over everything we've got that we've done, and then he can take it from there.
**Njepson**: We don't have to babysit them like the other guys.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Mcalcetero**: AJ Movies, cold storage.
**Ataylor**: Yep.
**Ataylor**: So they're setting the guard check permanently today.
**Ataylor**: We'll finalize the power this week.
**Ataylor**: Got a letter from the structural engineer, forwarded it onto our electrician, so he's going to take a peek at it, and then we'll hopefully have that out the door tomorrow.
**Ataylor**: That should cover basically everything on phase one, and we will be complete officially.
**Ataylor**: As far as that goes with the owner, see, we haven't been released.
**Ataylor**: I know.
**Ataylor**: Last week in our meeting, they.
**Ataylor**: They've basically forwarded some of this pricing that we sent them on to the.
**Ataylor**: They're in a lease negotiation right now with Real Op and so hope they're hoping to find out how much ti dollars they'll get, and then we should get the.
**Ataylor**: The release.
**Ataylor**: What else?
**Ataylor**: Can you scroll down, Maria?
**Ataylor**: Yeah, that's pretty much it.
**Ataylor**: I'll get that budget created that way.
**Ataylor**: That way we can code those.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Njepson**: All right.
**Njepson**: Nate, heard anything back from the ceiling guy and his he just.
**Ataylor**: He just got back from.
**Ataylor**: He was gone all last week.
**Ataylor**: So I'm dealing with Doug Anderson, his counterpart.
**Ataylor**: So I haven't gotten any word on.
**Ataylor**: On the audit, but I'll bump them again here.
**Mcalcetero**: Nick, Goodwill, Bart.
**Kjohnson**: Our final inspection is scheduled for Tuesday.
**Kjohnson**: And closing documents.
**Kjohnson**: I sent an email to the subs last week, and they're due this week.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Mcalcetero**: Still not starting.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay, we'll wait for those.
**Mcalcetero**: Great escape, ej.
**Ataylor**: Yep.
**Ataylor**: So this week we're.
**Ataylor**: We're starting the PD correction.
**Ataylor**: So we'll have busy week this week, and then putting the glass in end of the week, and then.
**Njepson**: Well, we'll.
**Ataylor**: Be done here in the next couple weeks, officially.
**Gducharme**: Awesome.
**Dmacari**: What about closed out documents?
**Ataylor**: Yep, I have.
**Ataylor**: I just need them from three other subs.
**Njepson**: So.
**Ataylor**: Brandon, I started a folder, started dumping them in there.
**Mcalcetero**: So getting documents as a new task as in progress.
**Njepson**: Do you have what's required?
**Njepson**: Like, how soon can they release the bond on that job?
**Njepson**: Don't we have two.
**Njepson**: One for the pathway and one for the.
**Njepson**: The changes that were made.
**Ataylor**: So the way.
**Ataylor**: The way it works is.
**Ataylor**: I don't know.
**Ataylor**: As far as the pud corrections go, Jesse, the big one, I would assume, once we get those done.
**Dmacari**: Yeah, once they're done and inspected.
**Dmacari**: We get it.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, we get it.
**Ataylor**: And then as far as how the public works department works is we tell them we're done, and then they come out and they actually create a punch list for us.
**Ataylor**: And then once that punch list is created, then they'll release that $9,000 one, which is the one that you do at the beginning of the job.
**Ataylor**: So that doesn't affect the.
**Ataylor**: The certificate of occupancy.
**Ataylor**: They just basically hold it until it's done.
**Njepson**: So we not have to do that on.
**Njepson**: On Westfield Collective.
**Ataylor**: I would.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: I think public works requires a bond.
**Dmacari**: Yeah, the owner pulled the bond.
**Njepson**: They did that one.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Dmacari**: Yeah.
**Dmacari**: That's.
**Dmacari**: What.
**Dmacari**: So is that right away work?
**Dmacari**: All that stuff done, A.J.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: The only thing we have left is the.
**Ataylor**: Is the path along 1 181st Street.
**Ataylor**: So we did the right away concrete stuff last week.
**Ataylor**: We just have that path along 186th.
**Dmacari**: Street, and it's not done.
**Ataylor**: Well, you got to let me finish.
**Dmacari**: Well, you said.
**Dmacari**: Yeah, except.
**Dmacari**: So it's.
**Dmacari**: No, we have XYZ left.
**Ataylor**: Yes.
**Ataylor**: So what we have left is the along.
**Ataylor**: I think it's 186th Street.
**Ataylor**: So we're gonna see when we can get that done.
**Ataylor**: Weather permitting, we've gotten a lot of water, so it's gonna be hard to get a proof roll done.
**Dmacari**: I would.
**Dmacari**: Have we done our top coat.
**Ataylor**: As.
**Dmacari**: Far as all the parking lot and everything?
**Ataylor**: Parking lot's done.
**Dmacari**: I thought we had some work to do there still.
**Ataylor**: Nope.
**Ataylor**: Parking lot's done.
**Ataylor**: We are.
**Ataylor**: We did our final striping too, so it's a private parking lot, so they don't really care about that, but it's done.
**Ataylor**: The only.
**Ataylor**: The only thing we have left to do is that front path.
**Ataylor**: And I've been calling Brian, my inspector, once a week and we'll just have to see, weather permitting, when we can get a proof roll done.
**Njepson**: How did it end up between the paving sub and your site contractor?
**Njepson**: Was that resolved like everyone's agreed?
**Njepson**: It's over with.
**Ataylor**: I'm giving them.
**Ataylor**: I'm giving them crate or corum deo.
**Ataylor**: So it's going away.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Mcalcetero**: Ulta Dallas A.J.
**Ataylor**: Yep.
**Ataylor**: So here this week, all is good.
**Ataylor**: We had a deadline of being done with aisle three today, and we did get that done and tested.
**Ataylor**: All is good.
**Ataylor**: We're gonna.
**Ataylor**: We got an answer on what welder we're going to use and so we're going to continue with Homestead and that starts on the 21st.
**Njepson**: So are they doing night supervision?
**Ataylor**: They are not doing night supervision.
**Ataylor**: So the way I've done it in the past is I've just stayed and got them going until like 10:00.
**Ataylor**: Once I see sparks flying, I've gotten out of there and they're.
**Ataylor**: They're okay with that.
**Ataylor**: Scott with the Vargo superintendent's gonna be around too, so we'll tag team it.
**Ataylor**: But whether it's me or when Candon's down here, if he just gets them going until about 10, fill out the hot work permit and take a bunch of pictures of our setup and then just show up early in the morning when they're finishing and they're good with that.
**Ataylor**: So I have a meeting tomorrow to go through a schedule that I'll put together.
**Njepson**: When is that starting the welding?
**Ataylor**: The welding starts the 21st, so two weeks.
**Dmacari**: What about all these, like, TCO extension permit send proposal to Ulta for RTU break drawings in a single pages for Dallas review.
**Dmacari**: Dive into Dean's contract.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: So Deep called me, Brandon, and he was like, I'm trying to figure out what Jared Richie put together for you guys.
**Ataylor**: So I said, I.
**Ataylor**: I said I'm on site so I'll call him next week.
**Ataylor**: But there was something in regards to the D mod lighting.
**Ataylor**: And so I.
**Ataylor**: I don't know exactly what the issue is I got to dive into it.
**Dmacari**: It's probably where.
**Dmacari**: If you're.
**Dmacari**: If memory serves me correct, what we did was we did where.
**Dmacari**: Where the trash rows are.
**Dmacari**: We did every other kind of caddy corner, and then we took those lights and applied them to demod.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: I.
**Ataylor**: I just.
**Ataylor**: It's on my list to dive into.
**Ataylor**: I didn't put a date on that one, but so we did.
**Ataylor**: We got our updated amendment drawings from Dematic.
**Ataylor**: Finally on Friday, I sent those to the architect to resubmit.
**Ataylor**: So those have been resubmitted, but they did respond.
**Ataylor**: I have to break them into single files, so.
**Ataylor**: Which means I have to go through basically each page, make it a single file, and label it a certain way.
**Ataylor**: It's kind of ridiculous.
**Ataylor**: Takes a lot of time.
**Ataylor**: So that's what I've been working on right now.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay, guys.
**Mcalcetero**: And to see Jesse.
**Mcalcetero**: Tennessee license.
**Mcalcetero**: How are we doing on that?
**Njepson**: Believe we're just waiting for the audit.
**Dmacari**: Yeah.
**Dmacari**: Which is a nightmare.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay.
**Mcalcetero**: Thank you, Jesse.
**Mcalcetero**: Office supplies is this new project.
**Mcalcetero**: What is this?
**Ataylor**: I think that happened when.
**Dmacari**: I think that should probably be deleted.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, that should probably be deleted, but that's a.
**Ataylor**: That's a code thing when you're coding credit cards, because I know West Lane Church was created from me coding something to a credit card.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Mcalcetero**: We have 30 days to record in case you need it.
**Ataylor**: All right.
**Mcalcetero**: Was the Lion Church?
**Mcalcetero**: Is this who.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, you can put me on there.
**Dmacari**: This was added due to needing to code for the added work we did not do in their tv.
**Ataylor**: Yes, we did work for their new tv.
**Ataylor**: So we also never approved retainage checks.
**Dmacari**: Okay, so what do we need to do for that?
**Ataylor**: Approve them and have accounting cut them.
**Dmacari**: Okay.
**Dmacari**: Are you able to do that?
**Ataylor**: Yep, yep, it's on there.
**Gducharme**: Where?
**Gducharme**: Here?
**Ataylor**: No, I think I already approved them.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay.
**Mcalcetero**: But these two are post.
**Mcalcetero**: Anything new from Bella Campus, Maryland.
**Mcalcetero**: Brandon?
**Dmacari**: I.
**Dmacari**: I don't know if they're gonna go through with it or not.
**Dmacari**: You're in a holding pattern.
**Dmacari**: Probably give it another three weeks or so, see what they say.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: You think Brian's repricing ours?
**Ataylor**: Brandon?
**Dmacari**: Pro.
**Mcalcetero**: And the same with Will Heritage.
**Mcalcetero**: Still three weeks more.
**Dmacari**: I would just go ahead and call that one gone.
**Mcalcetero**: Lost.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Hey, Brandon, so I did approve these in here.
**Ataylor**: You want me to just send screenshots to accounting to make sure they.
**Ataylor**: They.
**Ataylor**: They check them for the retainage?
**Ataylor**: Because I don't think it's communicating.
**Ataylor**: Right.
**Dmacari**: Yep.
**Dmacari**: Go ahead and just send screenshots to them.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay, guys, we are done.
**Mcalcetero**: Anything else you guys want to update?
**Mcalcetero**: You want to comment on any of the projects?
**Gducharme**: Oh, good.
**Dmacari**: Yep.
**Dmacari**: Jesse, anything?
**Njepson**: No, I haven't got an email back yet, but will add a job for West Palm beach and.
**Dmacari**: Yeah, I saw that.
**Dmacari**: That's pretty tight.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: And Aspire Health, is that the same.
**Dmacari**: One that he was talking about?
**Dmacari**: It's just.
**Dmacari**: It was West Palm, not Fort Myers.
**Njepson**: Well, I think this is a different one and it's where they just want to do finish up grades on the whole facility.
**Ataylor**: So are these all Aspire jobs?
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: Nice.
**Dmacari**: Oh, it pays to do a free little door replacement.
**Njepson**: That's right.
**Njepson**: Well, as I talk to them today, he's.
**Njepson**: And check on where our payments are to get them the payment for that free door work and the just, you know, the just all of them and see where they're at with that.
**Njepson**: I just noticed the senior planner for Indie, they put he him next to his name.
**Njepson**: Is that a Indiana something?
**Ataylor**: It's the way of the world now, Jesse.
**Njepson**: No, it's not.
**Dmacari**: That's a democratic thing.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay guys, so thank you for doing your updates.
**Mcalcetero**: Thank you, Glenn, also for doing your updates and also AJ that's really helpful.
**Gducharme**: And faster for us.
**Mcalcetero**: If you guys need anything, don't forget to just let me know.
**Mcalcetero**: And don't forget you do your card transactions and welcome to your first meeting, Andres.
**Gducharme**: Thank you.
**Mcalcetero**: I was able to get used to these ones.
**Njepson**: Is everyone updated on their credit card transactions?
**Ataylor**: I had a question on the invoices that they're putting in there.
**Ataylor**: Is that how you want us to start doing them?
**Dmacari**: Brandon, the invoices are going to be going through Notion too?
**Dmacari**: Yeah, everything will be going through there.
**Dmacari**: So timesheets should be getting in there.
**Dmacari**: Yeah, we're working on getting that done.
**Dmacari**: The credit cards obviously are already in there and then the all the direct costs.
**Dmacari**: So some of you guys have some transactions that you coded that I kicked back because they were either incorrect or missing stuff or something.
**Ataylor**: And will those pop up on the transaction page, Brandon, if you kick them back?
**Dmacari**: Yeah.
**Dmacari**: So when you go back to your my dashboard, it'll show like, you know, stuff that's in your course.
**Dmacari**: So it would, it would revert back to you.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Is there a way you can get them then for the invoices?
**Ataylor**: Are you working on creating like a tab for.
**Ataylor**: For invoices?
**Ataylor**: Kind of like what we have with credit cards.
**Dmacari**: Maria, can we do something like that?
**Dmacari**: To where that like the invoices, their utilities invoice.
**Ataylor**: Well, it may be hard because they don't know what job they're necessarily to that.
**Dmacari**: Right.
**Dmacari**: That's the thing.
**Dmacari**: We don't know.
**Dmacari**: They don't know exactly what jobs they are for.
**Ataylor**: So to just leave it up to us to go in there and basically claim them, which is fine.
**Ataylor**: I just didn't know how you guys want to do it.
**Dmacari**: Yeah, we'll probably have to do that until we get to a point where it's more well known or something like that.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah.
**Mcalcetero**: And, yeah, we'll get also try to find, you know, more like, notion person that can do this type of things that faster, because I know we want to move faster on these things.
**Mcalcetero**: So I'll let you know, guys.
**Mcalcetero**: But we're working on it.
**Ataylor**: Sweet.
**Dmacari**: All right.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Dmacari**: Thank you.
**Mcalcetero**: Thank you, guys.
**Njepson**: Thanks.
**Gducharme**: Bye.
