## Transcript
**Mcalcetero**: Hi, Maria.
**Mcalcetero**: I think you might be muted.
**Mcalcetero**: Can you hear me?
**Mcalcetero**: I cannot hear you if you are talking.
**Mcalcetero**: It looks like you are muted, though.
**Mcalcetero**: Hi, William.
**Williamo**: Hey, how you doing?
**Mcalcetero**: Good, how are you?
**Williamo**: Very good.
**Mcalcetero**: Good.
**Mcalcetero**: Maria's just doing, but.
**Mcalcetero**: Oh, looks like.
**Mcalcetero**: Oh.
**Mcalcetero**: Hi, Maria.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: How are you?
**Mcalcetero**: How are you?
**Bracken.el-bakri**: How are you guys?
**Mcalcetero**: Good.
**Mcalcetero**: How's it going?
**Mcalcetero**: All good.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: Thank you so much for joining and taking care of this very quick.
**Mcalcetero**: Oh, no problem.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, no, I like to get things moving as quick as possible.
**Mcalcetero**: So when, when, when you said you could meet this morning, that would be great.
**Mcalcetero**: So are we waiting for anyone else on your end?
**Bracken.el-bakri**: No, to be honest, if you, if, if anything, I'll try to ask Brandon to join, but just let you know.
**Mcalcetero**: Oh, okay.
**Mcalcetero**: No, I mean, if you have any questions, you can always, you know, email us after this or if anyone else has questions and then we could get you answers.
**Mcalcetero**: Really what this is just to do is kind of introduce ourselves and kind of explain how the process works and, you know, see if you have any questions.
**Mcalcetero**: And it looks like Darby did send some documents.
**Mcalcetero**: So I just saw that.
**Mcalcetero**: I haven't really flipped them over, so.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, well, William, I just sent you the adoption agreement.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: So he just.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: So last week he just sent us, you know, everything.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: So just to put you in a little bit of context, like, we work with work smart systems, like I will say like two years or probably 20, 20 something.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: But we just decided to stop with them till December 2024 and we start with venture this year, January 2025.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: We didn't know, I mean, yesterday I was talking with Bracken and he didn't know that we had actually a 401k plan.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: So I didn't.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: Probably we missed that or probably we weren't even aware of it.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: So that's why we couldn't do the transfer prior to this.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: But then, as you can see in the email that Darby sent to you, they just one.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: He said the idea for you is to have a transfer rather than a termination because the termination will make you eligible in the future, blah, blah.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: So it's better if you transfer everything to your new provider.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: So we said, okay.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: So that's what happened.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: They send us everything.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: They send us a form per fill bracket and fill it out.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: Yesterday I sent it to the team and to you.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: And then, yeah, they just send documentations and everything related to the contract.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: So if you sew everything, I just check the email.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: But they are just.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: I think they're asking you specific questions in terms of how to do the transfer.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: And everything.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: But other than that, we had no idea, to be honest, with what was the plan in the past with Work Smart Systems.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay.
**Mcalcetero**: All right, well, so thank you for telling us all that because that helps us moving forward.
**Mcalcetero**: So William has the adoption agreement.
**Mcalcetero**: And then so just to kind of give you a background or how we work here.
**Mcalcetero**: So I work on the team with Bracken and Keaton at Venture.
**Mcalcetero**: And then William is.
**Mcalcetero**: He works for Slavic.
**Mcalcetero**: So William and I work together.
**Mcalcetero**: William and his team and I work together to do the plan transfer aspect of it.
**Mcalcetero**: So if you ever had any questions, you can email William or myself.
**Mcalcetero**: But that's just to kind of gets a little confusing.
**Mcalcetero**: You're like, who do you work for?
**Mcalcetero**: So I'm with Venture, Williams with Slavic.
**Mcalcetero**: But William and I and his team work together on the transfer.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: Ok, sounds good.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah.
**Mcalcetero**: So you can email either of us or both of us either vote or both, right?
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay.
**Mcalcetero**: Both of us will.
**Mcalcetero**: We keep in.
**Mcalcetero**: We keep, you know, we're on the same track as far as, you know, with all our clients and all that.
**Mcalcetero**: So.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: Yeah, no, I honestly know.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: I just want to say thank you because you guys jumped super quick on this and we were just.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: Because obviously we have a timeline to send these, blah, blah, blah.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: So you guys were very, very helpful on that.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: And if you have like any document that you need from my side or anything, just let me know.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: We usually.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: I always ask the.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: Our accounting team or finance team to send that super quick and everything so we get it for you on time.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: But then, yeah, I mean, if you need anything else on my transfer, let me know.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: I know Darby already sent you everything, but anything, again, it can be a lot of things.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: So just let me know.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay?
**Mcalcetero**: Okay, sounds good.
**Mcalcetero**: All right, well, that.
**Mcalcetero**: So from here I'll just kind of go over.
**Mcalcetero**: Have you been through a plan transfer before?
**Bracken.el-bakri**: No, this is our first time.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay, well, that's fine because we'll hold your hand through it and guide you.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay.
**Mcalcetero**: So it's.
**Mcalcetero**: You don't have to do things on your own, you know, and you may get some emails, some automatically like generated emails you might get and you.
**Mcalcetero**: You might send to yourself.
**Mcalcetero**: Like, why are they asking for this again?
**Mcalcetero**: We just can't stop some of them from going out.
**Mcalcetero**: So if you ever get anything and you're like, why am I getting this?
**Mcalcetero**: I thought I did this.
**Mcalcetero**: Just forward it on to William and I and say, do I need to do anything with this email or not?
**Mcalcetero**: And then we'll call you.
**Mcalcetero**: Or no.
**Mcalcetero**: So, so what I'll do is just share my screen and just kind of go over how the transfer process works.
**Mcalcetero**: And then if you have any questions, just stop me or you can ask me at the end.
**Mcalcetero**: And I really just try and simplify it so not get too much into the details because the most work you'll have to do is gathering some of the documents and reports.
**Mcalcetero**: So once we get everything that we need for Slavic, because they have to do a review of your current plan.
**Mcalcetero**: So, but yeah, so that this is the most work you would be doing is helping us gather all these things at the beginning and then throughout the process.
**Mcalcetero**: You might have to sign something here and there, but we'll guide you through everything.
**Mcalcetero**: So, all right, so I'm going to share my screen.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay.
**Mcalcetero**: Can you see my screen?
**Bracken.el-bakri**: Yes, perfect.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay, great.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay, so this is a document that I'll pre fill for you and send to you to sign.
**Mcalcetero**: And what it is, is it's called the Slavic Plan Merger Information Packet.
**Mcalcetero**: And it goes over what's involved in the transfer process, the timeline, and, you know, gives you some explanation of certain things.
**Mcalcetero**: So I like, I said, I like to simplify it.
**Mcalcetero**: So it might look a little daunting, but it will simplify it and try and explain it best as possible.
**Mcalcetero**: So at the beginning of this document, so like I said, at the beginning of this process, we're going to gather all the documents and reports.
**Mcalcetero**: So it looks like Darby sent the adoption agreement, the basic plan document, this the spd.
**Mcalcetero**: So he sent us some of these documents.
**Mcalcetero**: But right here, this explains why Slavic will do their review once we receive the documents and reports.
**Mcalcetero**: And they just need to review the current plan to make sure it's in compliance with the IRS regulations and make sure it's in good standing.
**Mcalcetero**: Now, if anything pops up that it's not in compliance or there's something, you know, that needs to be corrected, William and his team will let us know and then we just work through it.
**Mcalcetero**: So, but this just kind of explains what they do with the documents when they review them.
**Mcalcetero**: And then below, right here, this is the list of documents for the most part, that they, Slavic, will need to do the review.
**Mcalcetero**: Like I said, we already have this adoption agreement.
**Mcalcetero**: We have the summary plan description, so we'll just need to grab maybe a few other ones.
**Mcalcetero**: I'll read through the email that Darby sent and, and I'll share it with William and then we'll have a better understanding of what else we need from this.
**Mcalcetero**: So don't worry about it.
**Mcalcetero**: We'll let you Know what we need.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: Okay.
**Mcalcetero**: If we need anything else, do you have any questions on that?
**Bracken.el-bakri**: No, to be honest, no.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: Just, you know, like, trying to, like following the process and just trying to make sure, like, everything is.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: No, but no, no questions so far.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay.
**Mcalcetero**: And you may have ones that pop up after the call.
**Mcalcetero**: Just email them when you have them.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay.
**Mcalcetero**: So that just kinds of.
**Mcalcetero**: That goes over why Slavic does their review and what documents and reports they review.
**Mcalcetero**: So then this page breaks down the steps for the whole transfer process.
**Mcalcetero**: So I simplify these 10 steps really into, like three main steps.
**Mcalcetero**: And the first step is, like I said, we're gathering the documents and reports from your current plan.
**Mcalcetero**: And then once we have all those, we'll go to the second step.
**Mcalcetero**: And that's when Slavic does their due diligence review.
**Mcalcetero**: And they review all those documents and reports.
**Mcalcetero**: Now, once they're done with that review, like I said, if there's anything that pops up, they'll let us know.
**Mcalcetero**: If not, but they'll email and let us know when they're done with their review.
**Mcalcetero**: So once they're done with the review.
**Mcalcetero**: And they will also send what's called these plan merger legal documents.
**Mcalcetero**: It's just a four to six pages.
**Mcalcetero**: And what they are is Slavic creates them and it merges the old plan with the new plan.
**Mcalcetero**: So when we.
**Mcalcetero**: When you get these documents, if you have any questions, we can go over them with you and answer any questions.
**Mcalcetero**: You only have to sign, I think, like two or three pages.
**Mcalcetero**: So.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay.
**Mcalcetero**: And they'll send those to you via conga sign.
**Mcalcetero**: It's like DocuSign, but it's conga sign.
**Mcalcetero**: So if you're good with it, then you sign it and it goes back to Slavic.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay.
**Mcalcetero**: And then the next.
**Mcalcetero**: So during this second step, also, if there's anything that Worksmart Systems needs us to do for a deconversion, like if they need us to fill out any paperwork, which means like the wiring instructions for all the assets, when they're wired, they're going to want to know the bank account information.
**Mcalcetero**: So they may have something on their portal.
**Mcalcetero**: I don't know, I've never worked with them before.
**Mcalcetero**: Or they may have a paper document that we need to fill out, but we'll help you do whatever it is that they need.
**Mcalcetero**: And they'll need that to give us the transfer dates.
**Mcalcetero**: So, yeah, so we'll let you know.
**Mcalcetero**: Or we'll help you with that, the deconversion paperwork and when we get to that point.
**Mcalcetero**: So once we get that to work, smart Systems, then we're going to ask them for transfer dates, and then that'll put us into the last step of the transfer process.
**Mcalcetero**: So Work Smart will give us some transfer dates and they're also called, what's.
**Mcalcetero**: It's called blackout dates.
**Mcalcetero**: And in this final step of the transfer, the blackout period, they're going to give us a date that, you know, let's say October 1st or September 1st.
**Mcalcetero**: Let's say I'm just throwing a random date out.
**Mcalcetero**: So they'll say, okay, we're ready, you know, we're ready to give you these dates.
**Mcalcetero**: The blackout period start date is going to be September 1st, and then they'll have a liquidation date and then a wire date.
**Mcalcetero**: So they're going to give us three dates, and that's.
**Mcalcetero**: Those three dates are for the, the last step of the process, and that's the actual transfer of all the assets from Worksmart to Slavic.
**Mcalcetero**: So I could go more into it when we get closer to that, but what the blackout period is basically, it's essentially a temporary freeze on participants accounts.
**Mcalcetero**: So once this goes into the blackout period, participants, if they, if they do have any assets in the current account, they won't be able to make any changes in their account during this brief period while the assets and final records and everything are transferring from Work Smart to Slavic.
**Mcalcetero**: So they either have to do.
**Mcalcetero**: If they want to do something before the transfer, they can do it.
**Mcalcetero**: They get a notice 30 days before this blackout period will begin.
**Mcalcetero**: So they'll get Slavic mails them a notice saying, hey, if you want to do anything with your account at Work smart, you have 30 days to do it.
**Mcalcetero**: Otherwise you're gonna have to wait until the transfer is complete and then all their assets will transfer over just fine.
**Mcalcetero**: So, so, but like I said, we could go over this much more in depth and you know, closer to the.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, yeah, because right now what I'm telling you is like drinking out of a fire hose.
**Mcalcetero**: You're gonna like, get a little bit in your mouth, but the rest is going way over.
**Mcalcetero**: So I don't want to overload you.
**Mcalcetero**: But yeah, like I said, we'll walk you through all these steps, but that's really the transfer process.
**Mcalcetero**: So we want to get to the point where we get those transfer dates, because once we get those transfer dates, then we're all set.
**Mcalcetero**: And, and then usually they.
**Mcalcetero**: I don't know how quick they do it at Work Smart Systems, a lot of the plan providers can do dates 45 days out to 90.
**Mcalcetero**: So we want to.
**Mcalcetero**: The Quicker we can get to that, getting those transfer dates, the better.
**Mcalcetero**: And sometimes they might be sooner.
**Mcalcetero**: Like I said, I don't know how Work Smart Systems works.
**Mcalcetero**: They might be pretty quick in giving close dates, but we just don't know.
**Mcalcetero**: We have to go by the dates they give us.
**Mcalcetero**: But that's really how the transfer process works.
**Mcalcetero**: The first step is gathering the plan documents.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: Correct.
**Mcalcetero**: Currently, it works from Worksmart.
**Mcalcetero**: The second step is Slavic will review those documents and reports and then create some plan merger legal documents.
**Mcalcetero**: And then the last step is.
**Mcalcetero**: Or then we'll ask for the transfer dates.
**Mcalcetero**: And then the last step is we go into that blackout period, and that's the actual transfer of the plan.
**Mcalcetero**: Merging the plans together.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: Okay.
**Mcalcetero**: And then just to point out if.
**Mcalcetero**: And we'll pull a report that'll show us this.
**Mcalcetero**: If anyone currently has a loan in the 401k plan, we just want them to reach out directly to Work Smart to see how Worksmart handles the loans.
**Mcalcetero**: Some plan providers say you don't have to make any payments until after the transfer's done.
**Mcalcetero**: Some say, you know, you have to continue making your loan payments or if they're automatically being deducted out of their payroll or.
**Mcalcetero**: It just depends.
**Mcalcetero**: But if you don't know off the top of your head if anyone has a loan, like I said, we'll pull a report that'll show us.
**Mcalcetero**: So.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: Okay, sounds good.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah.
**Mcalcetero**: And usually they transfer over just fine with the rest of the assets.
**Mcalcetero**: We just never want them to default.
**Mcalcetero**: So.
**Mcalcetero**: But like I said, we can go a little more into that later, too.
**Mcalcetero**: And then the last page of this document is just you acknowledging that there's a $500 fee payable to Slavic for the transfer, and that'll be invoiced when the transfers all complete.
**Mcalcetero**: So.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: Okay, perfect.
**Mcalcetero**: And that's really it.
**Mcalcetero**: So I'll pre fill this and send it to you.
**Mcalcetero**: And I'll send you instructions what to do with it.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: One question, Kathy.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: So this obviously has to be Brandon's name on it, right?
**Bracken.el-bakri**: He's the CEO of the company rather than myself, so I'm obviously his executive assistant.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: So I sign it and everything.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: But he has to be under Brandon Clymer, which is the CEO of the company, just to let you know how this name is.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: I can type it up for you.
**Mcalcetero**: V. Perfect.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: Yeah, I can type it up for you.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: That's better.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: But so, because yesterday, for example, I send it to Brandon Clymer.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: I don't know if you see it.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: You can see it in the chat.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: Of the teams.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: The meeting chat, probably.
**Mcalcetero**: Oh, yes.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: If you go there and then you go to teams.
**Mcalcetero**: All right.
**Mcalcetero**: See, I'm like, that's okay.
**Mcalcetero**: I'll.
**Mcalcetero**: If you just want to spell it.
**Mcalcetero**: I don't know why I can't.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: Oh, you know, he's copied in the email too.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: Brandon.
**Mcalcetero**: Perfect.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: Yes.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: That's it.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: So he's our CEO.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: And then again yesterday when I sent the pre filled form to Darvin, I signed it obviously under his name because he's, you know, he's the CEO.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: It's not me.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: So.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay, I'll put it under Brandon's name.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: Yes.
**Mcalcetero**: And then I'll also pre fill this letter.
**Mcalcetero**: It's a template, but I'll pre fill it for you.
**Mcalcetero**: This is just authorizing Work Smart systems to work with Slavic and get Slavic whatever they need.
**Mcalcetero**: So you're authorizing them to work with Slavic.
**Mcalcetero**: So I'll pre fill it and then Brandon will just have to sign and date this one too.
**Mcalcetero**: But I'll put instructions for both of these documents and what to do with it.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: Perfect.
**Mcalcetero**: And this also lists the documents and reports that are needed.
**Mcalcetero**: Again, but like I said, we already have some of these, so.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay, but this, this letter just really authorizes, like I said, for Work Smart to work with Slavic, so.
**Mcalcetero**: And you're saying that's okay.
**Mcalcetero**: So I'll send you that.
**Mcalcetero**: And then outside of that, I'm going to stop sharing.
**Mcalcetero**: And then, William, do you have anything that you want to add?
**Williamo**: No, not really.
**Williamo**: I think Maria, she mentioned that she already sent information to you.
**Williamo**: So right now, Kathy, I'm having issues like logging into my outlook.
**Williamo**: So.
**Williamo**: But if you can send me that information that you got from Maria once I get access again, I'll be reviewing that information and yeah, let Maria know about what information we still need or if we have like everything to move forward with the process.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay, so I'll email you.
**Mcalcetero**: William, I'll forward you this email from Work Smarts and then it'll have Maria on there and it has this Brandon on there.
**Mcalcetero**: Climber.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: Yes, sure.
**Mcalcetero**: And then you'll have Maria.
**Mcalcetero**: Then you'll have William's email as well.
**Mcalcetero**: So.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: Perfect.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: That's going forward.
**Mcalcetero**: You can reach out to us if you, you know, for some reason don't get an answer or need other help, then you always can reach out to Bracken as well.
**Mcalcetero**: But yeah, William and I will always get back to you and say, we don't know, but let us look into it.
**Mcalcetero**: Or we have the answer.
**Mcalcetero**: And here you go.
**Mcalcetero**: But sounds good.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay, great.
**Mcalcetero**: So William, I'll forward you this email and then William, Will and Maria, I'll send you an email with these two forms pre filled and then just have them signed and dated and get send them back whenever you can.
**Mcalcetero**: It's not like a huge rush, but okay.
**Mcalcetero**: And then William will email us and let us know what else he still needs.
**Mcalcetero**: Does that sound good, William?
**Williamo**: Yeah, it sounds good.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay, great.
**Mcalcetero**: All right.
**Mcalcetero**: Well, it was wonderful to meet you, Maria.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: Thank you guys.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: It was wonderful to meet you too.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: And then again, if you need anything from my side, email, you know, I'm super available all the time.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: And thank you, Kathy.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: Thank you, William, for your help.
**Mcalcetero**: Great day.
**Mcalcetero**: Have a good weekend.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: You too.
**Williamo**: Have a good one.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: You too.
**Bracken.el-bakri**: Bye, guys.
**Williamo**: Bye.
**Mcalcetero**: Bye.
