## Transcript
**Jdawson**: Hi, Jesse.
**Jdawson**: Good morning.
**Speaker 1**: Morning, Maria.
**Speaker 1**: How you doing?
**Jdawson**: What?
**Jdawson**: Good.
**Jdawson**: What is, what is the meaning of that expression?
**Jdawson**: So uppity.
**Speaker 1**: Uppity.
**Speaker 1**: It's like people that are stuck up, snobbish.
**Jdawson**: Oh, I see.
**Jdawson**: Okay, I see.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, so that's what I would read.
**Jdawson**: So I want to show you.
**Jdawson**: So we are like clear on the steps that we need for everything.
**Jdawson**: So yesterday I read the entire thing because apparently California is like, please read carefully.
**Jdawson**: I don't want you to blah, blah, blah.
**Jdawson**: So, okay, let's show my screen with you.
**Jdawson**: So everything is here already on the folder.
**Jdawson**: Correct.
**Jdawson**: So this is what we need to fill out.
**Jdawson**: We have two options.
**Jdawson**: So I search first of all, the reciprocity program with contractor's license.
**Jdawson**: So general information.
**Jdawson**: So this is important in terms of out of state individuals can apply for a California license if they meet qualifications.
**Jdawson**: California.
**Jdawson**: So that says that we have.
**Jdawson**: From Arizona, Louisiana, Nevada.
**Jdawson**: So we're good with that one.
**Jdawson**: Now the next thing.
**Jdawson**: So reciprocity requirement.
**Jdawson**: So the contractor must apply for a license in a classification that appears on that state's reciprocal classification list.
**Jdawson**: If we click here.
**Jdawson**: Yes, we are.
**Jdawson**: So for example, B1, that is from Arizona.
**Jdawson**: So reciprocity program is general building.
**Jdawson**: So we do have it.
**Jdawson**: So that's good.
**Jdawson**: Now the contractor.
**Speaker 1**: Sorry, never mind.
**Speaker 1**: Sorry.
**Jdawson**: Sorry.
**Jdawson**: So the contractor must have held an active license in good standing in one of the reciprocal states for the previous five years.
**Jdawson**: But I searched and they said that if you don't have that, you can have your experience showing that you work for works related to the license.
**Jdawson**: You're asking.
**Jdawson**: And if you have a resume that actually mentioned or a license degree related to it.
**Jdawson**: Sorry, a degree.
**Jdawson**: So that's good.
**Jdawson**: Now the contractor must submit the request for verification of license form that is completed by the licensing entity under which he or she already is licensed.
**Jdawson**: So I already downloaded and I want to show you what it is.
**Jdawson**: So this is the PDF.
**Jdawson**: So we need to fill out these.
**Jdawson**: So probably your name, mailing address, state zip code I'm currently applying as.
**Jdawson**: And then it says, please complete the top section of this page only.
**Jdawson**: Then submit this request to the agency that can verify your license, which means we need to send that to Arizona.
**Jdawson**: That agency will return the verification to you at the address you provided below.
**Jdawson**: Do not open the envelope containing the verification.
**Jdawson**: Forward the sealed envelope to the California License Board along with your application for licensure.
**Jdawson**: So first thing that we need to do, everything is on the folder.
**Jdawson**: So I need you to fill out this police and I need to know I'm going to search the.
**Jdawson**: Exactly the agency address so we can send it to Arizona and then they can send it back to us.
**Jdawson**: So in the meantime when that's going to be done, we will continue with this process.
**Jdawson**: So we will have this separate.
**Speaker 1**: So let me.
**Jdawson**: And then what we need to do is the control.
**Speaker 1**: So you have California gc.
**Speaker 1**: What was that form called?
**Jdawson**: It's called Request for verification of license.
**Jdawson**: Should be there.
**Jdawson**: Here.
**Jdawson**: You found it?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, because that's the one.
**Jdawson**: So everything is there.
**Jdawson**: And I already.
**Jdawson**: We already got the registration.
**Jdawson**: I did it yesterday night.
**Jdawson**: So we got it.
**Jdawson**: That's good to go.
**Jdawson**: Now the contractor must complete the application for original contractor's license.
**Jdawson**: So that's already.
**Jdawson**: The PDF is already on the folder.
**Jdawson**: And I have a question for you.
**Jdawson**: So there are two ways that we can do this like easy feel online like you and I did.
**Jdawson**: We.
**Jdawson**: We did Arizona PDF order.
**Jdawson**: Now we don't want to order because that's going to take time.
**Jdawson**: So up to you if you want to easy fill or PDF.
**Jdawson**: So what I did is just downloaded the PDF here and I read through everything here.
**Jdawson**: So certification of experience.
**Jdawson**: So if you want to read it and make sure like everything it's, you know, makes sense and everything.
**Speaker 1**: What's that called in here?
**Jdawson**: So that's the here.
**Jdawson**: Application for original.
**Jdawson**: The first one.
**Jdawson**: Application for original contractors License PDF.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So is everything in here?
**Jdawson**: So you will read all the sections and then at the end we can complete it by hand, you know like and for example for the work experience.
**Jdawson**: Be careful as well because they need like a specific things here.
**Jdawson**: So for example let's go to the work experience part.
**Jdawson**: So they said here light without it says most type of print neatly and legible in black and dark blue ink pencil is not acceptable.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Forms containing strikeout modifications, blah blah blah.
**Jdawson**: And then it says please read the general information on the previous page before beginning this form.
**Jdawson**: The qualifying individual must complete part one.
**Jdawson**: It is entirety before the certifier completes part two.
**Jdawson**: So the certifier for your work experience must complete part two in this interity after the qualifying individual or applicant has completed part one.
**Jdawson**: So we need somebody to complete this as well.
**Jdawson**: And it has to be four different experience because you have to complete four years or more if you want.
**Speaker 1**: So this one here, this is signed by.
**Jdawson**: Yes, I certify that I have direct knowledge of the work covering the time period outlined above.
**Jdawson**: So this is signed by the person certifying you.
**Jdawson**: So I certify under penalty under the law that information is submitted or maybe you date, signature, printed name and then was experience obtained working on your property as an owner, building, blah blah, etc.
**Jdawson**: So we need to complete this.
**Jdawson**: So what?
**Jdawson**: First things that we need to do is fill out the reciprocity form.
**Jdawson**: We will send it to Arizona and in the meantime we will complete these things.
**Jdawson**: We also need a bond for some for I think it's 100 something or so.
**Jdawson**: I'll ask Lisa to create that because she needs to order one.
**Jdawson**: Because I was trying yesterday to download the bond form like we did for Arizona.
**Jdawson**: But here specifically says I have it here it says only authorized surety companies may order the approved LLC employee worker bond form email blah blah blah.
**Jdawson**: So I cannot request it.
**Jdawson**: They have to request it on behalf of us.
**Jdawson**: Okay, I need to tell Lisa if she can request the bond so we can do this for California.
**Jdawson**: Now I was reading the exam.
**Jdawson**: So it says the California law and business exam for contract is administered by PSI Services at various locations to find.
**Jdawson**: And then it says you will need to refer to the notice to schedule an examination provided by the after your application is approved.
**Jdawson**: BSI has multiple locations and offer testing six days a week.
**Jdawson**: So I was reading if I can order something right now but they were saying no, once the application is approved we can apply for the test.
**Jdawson**: So like you said, similar to Georgia.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: And then do they get tests?
**Speaker 1**: Where do you get the test prep?
**Jdawson**: So it says.
**Jdawson**: So they have like some guides.
**Jdawson**: But I can download for example here Studying for examination.
**Jdawson**: But they have a book here.
**Jdawson**: The California contractor's license law and reference book is not.
**Jdawson**: So yeah, here.
**Jdawson**: This is the book.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.

**Jdawson**: A guide to contractor description.
**Jdawson**: One second please.
**Jdawson**: So that we can.
**Jdawson**: Well, there's a study guys here.
**Jdawson**: But I don't think you want the study guide.
**Jdawson**: I think you actually want the entire book.
**Speaker 1**: Well, I need the book to take in when I take the test.

**Speaker 1**: They give the study guides for free on here.

**Speaker 1**: See, they've already put in the tabs.
**Speaker 1**: They do it like people will buy the tab kits.
**Speaker 1**: Because when you do practice you can put tabs in your book.

**Speaker 1**: We can get that.
**Speaker 1**: We'll give you that.
**Speaker 1**: They say you somebody on your phone, your cell phone bill.
**Jdawson**: To be honest, not right now, but I might take that into consideration.
**Jdawson**: You want it, Jesse?
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Does that come with a mobile phone or just.
**Jdawson**: Can you hear the person?
**Jdawson**: Sorry.
**Speaker 1**: Does that come with a phone or just the mobile line?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, does it come with the phone or Visa line?
**Speaker 1**: The phone.
**Speaker 1**: It works two ways.
**Speaker 1**: You can get a phone from us which does cost, or if you have an extra phone that you're not currently using or a phone that you want to bring over, we can use that phone and it will be totally free of charge for one year on our unlimited plan.
**Speaker 1**: Like I said, in actual one year, it does go to $30 per month after that time.
**Speaker 1**: But that's still a great deal for a mobile line.
**Speaker 1**: And you can bring every as many lines as you want through that account for your business.
**Speaker 1**: It makes sense.
**Jdawson**: You want it, Jesse.
**Speaker 1**: When do we have to decide on that one?
**Jdawson**: I'm sorry, can you repeat that?
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, you have an extra phone laying around, which is what you do it right now.
**Speaker 1**: I use the IMEI number.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, we don't.
**Speaker 1**: We.
**Speaker 1**: We'll probably set that up on the 14th.
**Speaker 1**: We have a number or call you back on the 14th.
**Jdawson**: Yes, if you want, call us back on the 14th and then we will decide on anything.
**Jdawson**: I'll just, you know, let the team know about this and then we can just set that up.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Okay, perfect.
**Speaker 1**: This is your personal phone so you.
**Jdawson**: Can call the Jesse.
**Jdawson**: Do you want them to call you instead of myself.
**Speaker 1**: So you guys can support email us both and then we'll contact him.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, if you can.
**Jdawson**: Actually yes, I think you have our both emails correct?
**Speaker 1**: I have.
**Speaker 1**: The email I have on file is B C L Y M E R A L L E A T O T R O.
**Speaker 1**: Is that the right email address?
**Jdawson**: Yes, you can send it to that one and then I'll make sure to forward it to everybody so in the team so we can make a decision.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, but does he have our email?
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Speaker 1**: I'll also set a reminder on my calendar.
**Speaker 1**: Call you back on the 14th.
**Jdawson**: Perfect.
**Jdawson**: Sounds good.
**Jdawson**: Thank you.
**Jdawson**: Looking forward to today.
**Speaker 1**: Have a happy four.
**Jdawson**: You too.
**Jdawson**: Bye bye.
**Speaker 1**: Bye.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, he has everything.
**Jdawson**: So once you send the email I'll just forward it to you guys and you guys we will decide.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So that new guy Alec that start and said he doesn't like using his person he didn't want a phone allowance.
**Jdawson**: Oh really?
**Speaker 1**: So that way we can get you just buy phone and that'll be less than the phone allowed.
**Speaker 1**: So for the first forever.
**Speaker 1**: Really?
**Speaker 1**: First year.
**Jdawson**: Oh that's good.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so we'll let him know that and then.
**Jdawson**: I didn't know.
**Jdawson**: Okay, let's go.
**Speaker 1**: See I had the same deal with my phone through through Spectrum and it is cheap.
**Speaker 1**: It's only 30 bucks a month.
**Speaker 1**: Well that's good because I have like cable TV through them.
**Jdawson**: Ah, nice.
**Speaker 1**: Or not cable tv Internet.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So we are clear on what we need.
**Jdawson**: Correct.
**Jdawson**: So fill out the form please.
**Jdawson**: I'll call Arizona, I'll keep you posted where exactly we need to send that so they can say yes, they have reciprocity and in the meantime read the entire thing.
**Jdawson**: I read it yesterday and it makes sense.
**Jdawson**: But just, just if you see something weird or something that.
**Jdawson**: And then I'll ask Lisa because we need a surety bond as well.
**Jdawson**: So I'll ask her to send requests that on our behalf and then that's it.
**Jdawson**: And then we'll be good to go with California.
**Jdawson**: And then Georgia, I'm going to call them because it still says application submitted and then it still says the last update that they have from our application it was on June 27th.
**Jdawson**: And then I checked on view details, nothing is showing up.
**Jdawson**: And then I click on take me to my application page and then nothing is showing up.
**Jdawson**: So I just want to call them and make sure that everything makes sense.
**Jdawson**: And this is my daughter.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, hi.
**Speaker 1**: How are you?
**Jdawson**: Jesse?
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Speaker 1**: So cute.
**Jdawson**: Thank you.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: How many turnings?
**Jdawson**: Seven months.
**Jdawson**: Say hi.
**Speaker 1**: Hello.
**Jdawson**: Bye, Jesse.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so I'll keep you posted.
**Jdawson**: And then older than that, well, Arizona is good to go, so that's awesome.
**Jdawson**: And then.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that's it.
**Jdawson**: California is already registered, so I did that.
**Jdawson**: So we're good to go.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I agree.
**Speaker 1**: That is awesome.
**Speaker 1**: All right, well, thank you.
**Jdawson**: Okay, perfect.
**Jdawson**: I'll keep you posted and then I'll send you everything.
**Jdawson**: I mean, I don't, I don't think if you send it today, we'll just get a respond, you know, July 4th, but just go through it and maybe next week we'll send everything and start with everything.
**Jdawson**: Good.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: It's okay.
**Speaker 1**: Yep.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, good.
**Jdawson**: Talk to you later, Jesse.
