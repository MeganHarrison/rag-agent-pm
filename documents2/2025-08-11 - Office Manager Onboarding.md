**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So I'm going to set it up for you.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Okay.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Okay.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So we are here on Microsoft 365 admin center.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So if you go to users and you're going to go to active users and then let's say, for example, that's the way I created your email.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So you are going to click on Add a user and then let's say this is going to be Test and the last name is going to be test.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: And then this last name is Test, Test, test.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: And then the username will be Test.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Well, usually is always the first letter of your first name and then the last name.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So for example, mine is like this in your C or T, correct?
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Yeah, exactly.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So always keep that in mind.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: That is always the first letter of the first of the first name.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: And then complete last name and then add a little group.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So once you have that, usually I don't ask them to automatically create a password.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So I usually use the one that I gave you.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So a little 2025 or you know, so it's easier for them to reminder and everything.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: But it's up to you, you know.

**Ashleyleeortiz1**: You and I, we don't need it because we don't.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Usually we don't work on, you know, construction applications.

**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So it's okay.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Everything is already built to Brandon's car, so don't worry about it.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Now let's use this one because this is like a free one.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So let's hit next and then usually you select here the type of roles.

**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Well, we don't need this, to be honest.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: We don't fill this out.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: And then when you click next it's going to be like, okay, you finish and then it's going to tell you the email and the password of the person so you can share that with the person that is going to join.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So let me cancel this.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: I'm going to send you something.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So this is how you actually add the users.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: And then for example, I have you here, let's say you want to change some stuff.

**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So this is just to show you, you know, A.J.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: taylor and this is his link, his email and he has access to his license, usually Business standard and Plan Project 1 3.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: And this is just extra because this is.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Okay, so just to show you, this is a way for you to set up emails for new people.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Okay.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: On Microsoft 365 Admin Center.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Okay.

**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So this is for Microsoft.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Now I send with the, I send you these, which is our master login page.

**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So you can please log in with this one and then log in here and then you have everything.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: You have the password, you have the email and then you can just go ahead and let me know if you need the desk and the mouse that you require.
**Speaker 1**: Okay?
**Speaker 1**: Oh yeah, I just clicked.
**Speaker 1**: So I'm just now clicking it and it just asked me to ask for permission.
**Speaker 1**: So I'm going to request access.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Yes, please, so I can give you access.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Beautiful thing.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So one thing that I have, and I think it's important you're going to be also helping Jesse, I'm assuming, with a lot of things that he needs.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Correct?
**Speaker 1**: Yes.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So I have, as you can see here, I have Brandon's email inbox and I also have Jesse's.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So I don't know if you want to add Jesse's.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: I think you might be able to ask him, you know, add him here because sometimes, for example, Brandon is like, hey, I need you to set up an informed meeting for me on, you know, tomorrow.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So on the calendar you will see myself, which is blue, Brandon, which is green, and Jesse, which is yellow.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: You know.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Yeah, but that's up to you.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: I mean, I think it would be good if you can ask Jesse if, you know, you should add him to your email so you'll be able to track things for him.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Because I know he needs a lot of help with a lot of things.
**Speaker 1**: Yes.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So I think that will be the next step.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: You know, add him to the, you know, to your calendar, into your email.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So you are tracking what he's doing.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Okay, perfect, perfect.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So that's another thing.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Now we have a master thing here.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: What did you ask for permission?
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Let me see, one second.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So for example, if I go.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: I don't know if you asked for permission.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Did you know for the login?
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I just sent out the permission for the Excel.
**Speaker 1**: Are you mentioning the admin login?
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Yeah, no, here, for the Excel.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Did you ask for permission?
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Yes, I have asked permission.
**Speaker 1**: It's just waiting for.
**Speaker 1**: For.

**Speaker 1**: Yes, I did ask for permission.
**Speaker 1**: If you want to update your request, you can write a message here.
**Speaker 1**: It right now just says I'm awaiting for approval.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Did you send it to who?
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Sorry?
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: To Brandon, to.
**Speaker 1**: I. I am not 100% sure.
**Speaker 1**: Let me go ahead and try to share my screen and show you what I see.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Let me know, please.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Can you see my screen now.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Is loading?
**Speaker 1**: Yes.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, so let me just exit out of this.
**Speaker 1**: So this is our chat.
**Speaker 1**: When I click it, I did go ahead and ask for permission.
**Speaker 1**: And then it doesn't say who it sends to.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: We need permission to access this item.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: If you want to update your request, you can write a message here.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: I'd like access because.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Please wait.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Why don't you have it?
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: I should have.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: I should receive it, you know, from Brandon's email.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: That's weird.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Let me try to say, I guess.
**Speaker 1**: It should have gone to Brandon because it says his email is right here.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Yes, exactly.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Let me check.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: What's up?
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: How you coming?

**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Yes.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So where is notion here?
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Since I have browns here.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: There's something here that is called a leader group and I'm going to add you right now.

**Speaker 1**: Yes, from Brandon Pratt.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Yes, accepted.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Please accept it.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So you are part of Notion.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: What was the picture of the house?
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: He wanted to take a look.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Oh, this one?
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Yeah.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: I mean that's okay.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: We'll decide it there party.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Okay.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: And what he said to change, he said looks so they know what the front of it looks like.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: This also maybe something like no peaches, just fun.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Okay, good.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Let me know what's your there in Notion.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Yes.
**Speaker 1**: Right now I'm just.
**Speaker 1**: It's having me verify my Microsoft account.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: So I'm just going ahead and doing that.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Perfect.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Let me see.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Looking at the picture of the party here.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: But I don't know if he wants to.
**Speaker 1**: You usually.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: I know you mentioned something about, you know, being part of marketing.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So we usually use Notion, sorry, Canva for this.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Yes.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So I will give you access as well if you have to create some flyers or some things.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Okay.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So you are also familiar with this.
**Speaker 1**: Perfect.
**Speaker 1**: Awesome.
**Speaker 1**: And then right now it just shows that the Notion is loading through the invite.
**Speaker 1**: Ah, okay.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, I believe I'm in.
**Speaker 1**: I'm new to Notion.
**Speaker 1**: I'll make sure to do some my own research on my own time about it.
**Speaker 1**: Yes, I want to be in and out.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Correct.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So this is the Bible and this is something that is important to make sure that you know, because everything is in here.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So usually the most important page is a projects page, which is actually.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Let me just delete this.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Where all the projects are from everybody.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: And you can see here we actually have a meeting today for this, you know.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, got it.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: What is this?
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: No, we don't need this one.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: I'm sorry, let me just select this.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So everybody, for example, if you go here, you're gonna see that everybody is commenting on what they are doing, like what tasks are being done, which ones are pending, etc.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: You know, things like that.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So status.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Let me just filter this because we only want to show the in progress.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Perfect.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Right now I'm in Notion, but I'm just watching what you're doing on your screen to understand.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So you're good.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Exactly.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Now so to answer your question related to accounting and everything.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So if you go back to the main page on a little group, if you go to accounting, you're going to see something that is called transactions.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Everything that everybody spends is going to be here.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So if you go to imported one, for example, you're going to see Brandon Climber.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Let me show you for example, which one we don't have.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: I wanted to show you an example of myself, but we don't have any more.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So for example, let me try to find myself.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Let me just filter here once again.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Filter by employee.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: No, I don't want Brandon.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: I just want everybody.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Okay, there you go.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So if you can see for example AJ this is all his imports.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: And then he has a description of the expense, the debit, the credit and the credit card he used.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Okay, his credit card.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So that's what you're gonna.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: You have to do every time you do an exp.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Just need to add here initially accounting does it for you.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: They actually add these expenses for you.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: What you need to do is just select, for example, oh, this one was related to travel.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Or this was.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Was marketing, you know, or this one, you know, marketing market boards.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Or this one was office supplies.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Because this is usually what we do.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Office supplies, office furniture, you see.
**Speaker 1**: Yes, yes.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Or office related stuff.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So this is what you have to select.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: And then since you and I are not working with projects, like this is not related to any of the projects of construction.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So you can put here non project related.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Okay, Non project.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Okay, exactly.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Because this is not related to any project.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: And then for current projects, well we can.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: You can also put here non project related.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: No, actually not.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Because this is not a current project.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Just here on projects.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, okay.
**Speaker 1**: And then leave current projects.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: And then.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Exactly.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: And then the cost type, you can select from here if it's expense, labor, materials, subcontracts.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So usually for us it's an expense because we are not working with any of these things.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: No labor, no material, no subcontracts, just expense.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: And you can add a picture of the receipt here.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So for example, if you click on this one.
**Speaker 1**: Ah, okay.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: You're going to see that he uploaded the receipt, you know, from an Uber.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So he's casting that.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: And then you know, not a year receipt.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Let me try to find mines, although I think they're already.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: But let me try.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So you can see usually what you and I will be spending on, you know, because you and I weren't spending a lot of things.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So just right here.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So, so for example, this one.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So for example mine.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Go ahead.
**Speaker 1**: No, you go ahead.
**Speaker 1**: It's okay.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: For example, these ones, the description.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So I don't do this on notion accounting team.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Upload it to us and then we just have to code it.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So you are going to be very hearing a lot of people saying you need to code the expense.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So when they say coding, you're going just to see for example the name of the transaction, the debit and the car use and then you have to code it here.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So this is related to what?
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So for example marketing, travel, office supplies.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Office supplies.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Like you can see all of mines are related to travel or office supplies.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Non project related.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Some of them are related to some projects because the guys asked me for specific things but this is just, you know, like wait one second, why is this.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Oh yeah, so things like that, you know, and then the nothing in current projects and then the cost type.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: All of us are expense, you know, everything is an expense also here.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: And then if you can see here, I uploaded the receipt, you know, so 1153 for this wire or we just spend for example here, you know the photography that we did for an event.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So $800.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So we just posted here and those are the notes and that's it.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So this is where you have to do in notion related to your transactions.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: And does.
**Speaker 1**: So my question would be so the.
**Speaker 1**: So every time you spend on the card, how long does it take for the accounting to upload onto Notion?
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So usually before they actually do it like immediately, to be honest with you.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, okay.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: But the thing is that you will receive an email from Jose which is our accountant working on notion saying hey guys, your expenses are updated.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Please code it.
**Speaker 1**: Oh okay.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: And you will be tagged here.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Say for example if you go here you'll be oh, for example Jose tagged me.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: I'm going to show you in mine for example here.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So for example if my ebooks, for example Jose Mendez mentioned you in alpha graphics, you know and then I click here and then I said oh okay.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So then I have to code it.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So coded it, you know, is this, this expense is related to what?
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So this is to marketing.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: No project related expenses, you know.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Exactly.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: And that's what we do because accounting already does it on their own, you know, uploading everything to Notion.
**Speaker 1**: And for the notes I, I think you went through, I just might have missed it.
**Speaker 1**: But for the notes it, it looks like it's very similar to the cost type or not the cost type, but it looks like it's very similar to the.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: I believe it was the.
**Speaker 1**: Where is it?
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, it looks like it's very similar to like the cost type, but for notes is that where.
**Speaker 1**: Oh okay.
**Speaker 1**: It's just giving a title.
**Speaker 1**: It's just giving a title of what?
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Yeah, so for example sometimes here, for example this one, why are you buying a first class ticket?
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: You know like this is from Brandon, you know Asking to AJ notes about these things like Asia received.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So truck repairs, for example.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Even by that, by itself the name.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: If you say for example truck allowance.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: But what does that mean?
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Oh, it's for truck repairs.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Oh, gotcha.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: This one last minute, last minute Car rental.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Memphis cannot find receive.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: You know, like things like that.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Like people will use it.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: But honestly you and I, I don't think we might use it.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Like I don't think I use no notes.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Oh, here, for example, marketing business cars.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Airb Jack, for example, this one, this was an Airbnb and they didn't know exactly who belongs to.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So I was like, oh, this is for Jack.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: The Jack's Bloomington.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Oh, gotcha.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Okay.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Makes it, you know.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So for example, this one is.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: For example, if they say what is this?
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: For example plan hop.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Like what is it?
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: And then you I told you.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Oh no, this is subscription.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Because we do have a subscription based with them by itself.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Sometimes they don't understand what is the meaning of the title.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So that's why the more specific you are, the better.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So accounting understands exactly why are you spending your money.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Okay, right.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Okay, perfect.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So this is a notion and I think you will spend a lot of time here.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: You know, on the accounting part we do have also marketing tops if you want to go ahead and just, you know, like check that.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So for example, we have events here that I actually upload for Brandon that he has and everything.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: I don't think Jesse might have many.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So I will think you just need, you know, you can obviously just search everything, but usually it's the project stops and also the marketing tab.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: I need to ask if you're going to join us, Ashley, for the operations meeting.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: I would love to join.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: This is the company works.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Okay, perfect.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So this is Notion now.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So you have Microsoft Admin center.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Now you understand how to do emails.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Now this, which is very important in terms of operations and you know, like accounting and tracking everything here in Notion, the most important thing now is called Venture.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: This is where we do payroll.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: I do payroll, but I think it's important.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Well, I don't know if you might need to do payroll though.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: That's my question.
**Speaker 1**: I can always help you also.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Yeah, so Venture access to payroll.
**Speaker 1**: I used to use a smaller company for payroll for an old.
**Speaker 1**: My old company I just worked for which was called Frank Chrome.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Okay.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Okay.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So I just need to, you know, like verify this for you because what we do with Venture, I do everything in here.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So for example, I actually need to ask you because we don't have, we didn't have an office manager job position so I asked them to create it for you.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So now I can select it and you know, but I, they haven't get back to me.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So here actually this is where you can see everybody.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So Canon Andrew Climate.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: And if you click here, you're going to see everything.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Their work phone, their addresses, their, you know, they're single or married.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Their work phone where they leave other pay.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Actually how much are we getting?
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Are we paying them?
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: You know, taxes, the policies, so all that stuff.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: And actually I'm the person doing the new hires or new hire.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: For example, you.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Which I wanted to add you.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: But I don't have a position that it's called, you know, office manager.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: One second.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Nashley, give me one second.
**Speaker 1**: No problem.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Okay so.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So this is where I do everything but I want to make sure if you need access to that as well because I don't know if it's going to be too much.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, okay.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Okay, perfect.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Does that need to unit for a minute?
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Yes, also.

**Speaker 1**: Like always, like copying you and Jesse.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: It'S up to you.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: But I will say yes copy because they need to know what you are sending.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: They need to know for example if it's related to office.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: I mean it doesn't hurt, you know to copy them.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So I think it's important.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, great.
**Speaker 1**: Yes.
**Speaker 1**: I'll always copy you and Brandon.
**Speaker 1**: I mean sorry, not Brandon.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Jesse and Jesse.

**Ashleyleeortiz1**: And I.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Wait.
**Speaker 1**: Jesse and Brandon.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: If you want copy the three of us and I will do the same as well.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: I'll copy you because it's important for you to.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So we, you know, if.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: If you can support me with something or I can support you with something.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So we.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: We.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: The.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: The three of us are in tune.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: You know.
**Speaker 1**: Great.
**Speaker 1**: Yes.
**Speaker 1**: I love that.
**Speaker 1**: Yes.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Okay, perfect.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So new office manager for a later group.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Hi, Stephanie.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Stephanie, I want to introduce you to Ashley.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Did I spell it correctly?
**Speaker 1**: It's A S H L E Y. Ashley.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: She is our new office manager at the office now she's our new office manager and I would like if you can give her access to.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: What's the name of that platform once I can have it here if I go to later group and that is 10, I think is this one.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Yes, this is the one.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So this is a portal they use for everything.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So let me show you.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So once you're here, you're going to do a new service request.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So sometimes you can do, for example, hey, this is for our suite 180, the request type easy, you know, HTBCs to call to add janitorial key locks, landscaping, lighting, so things like that.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So you can manage everything from there.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Okay, so this is going to be, for example, if Jesse is like, hey Ashley, can you please tell the administration that we lost a key?
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So you can just actually go there and select a new service request if they want to, you know, have a, like a meeting or something or reserve a room.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So you can make a new reservation here and select the conference room.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Exactly.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So this one, this one, what time, etc.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So you can do that in advance here.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Yes.
**Speaker 1**: And this login information, will I be getting my own information?
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So that's what I'm asking them right now.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So I want them to give you access.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So you, you will have, they will give you access.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: They will send it to your link to the Ashley copied here.
**Speaker 1**: And did you want me to create.
**Speaker 1**: I, I assume you'll have all the information as well, but did you want me to create an additional either page to the Excel sheet or an additional Excel with all my logins?
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: No, to be honest, no.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: I mean if it's, if you have your own logins, you know, like very well organized, just yours, that's fine.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: But if it's something related to company wise, like for example is using Brandon's email or something and we need, for example, we just created a new login in a new application for construction.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So those definitely have to go in the master list, you know.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: But if it's only you.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: No, it's okay if it's just for the company.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Yes.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So has the funny one, Ashley copy here, she's our new office manager.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Can we please get her access to the Angus system?
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: And so I don't know if you might need a key though.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Yeah, And a key to the office as well.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Thank you so much.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Copy it in this email.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Yeah.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Because once you have it, you just can log in, you know, with your personal one.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So here.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So you just log in with your company one and then you can create a passport and then that's it.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Okay.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: For all the organizations.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Okay.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So hi Stephanie, what do you do to Ashley copying this email?
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: She's our new office manager.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Can we please get her access to The Angus system and to Angus Portal.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So I think in a key to the office as well.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Thank you so much.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Okay, awesome.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So you are already set up there now I already asked as well.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Correct.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: For Venture to give you.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Yes.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Payment Venture, once you have access to these, I'm just going to call you when I have.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Once they have to do new hires or once they have to do you know like payroll so you can know how to do it.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Okay.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: But don't worry.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Right now Venture is very, very easy friendly to do, but not right now.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Okay.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Something else that I'm missing or anything, let me know.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: I think we cover everything.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Do you have questions for me right now?
**Speaker 1**: Yes, I do have a couple questions.
**Speaker 1**: One of my questions would kind of be like well first with the Venture, did you need any of my information as of right now or.
**Speaker 1**: We're still waiting for them to create the job position and account.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: I'm still waiting for them.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So that's what I send them the email in terms of if they have any update on the job position.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So once they confirm with me, I will create you, but I'll show you how to do it.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Once I create, I'm going to say hey, let's create you together so you can see how is a new hire being done.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: How would do we do the i9s and then how to do payroll.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So I'll be adding you to all that stuff.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So don't worry.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Now once we have everything, I'll let you know what other things am I.
**Speaker 1**: Missing maybe regarding and every day I don't have to check in or check out when I come into the office because I was gonna ask like if I come in with a.
**Speaker 1**: Because I'm salary and I always come in before 8 because my hours are from.
**Speaker 1**: Are my hours from 8 to 5 correct?
**Speaker 1**: Okay, sounds good.
**Speaker 1**: I came in today at like 7:20.
**Speaker 1**: Jesse mentioned to come in between like 7 7:30.
**Speaker 1**: So I'm always gonna be here at that time.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: And then I do have a pat a stack of mail from Brandon and I'm quickly going through it.
**Speaker 1**: But I had a couple regarding all of these invoice notices and I would like your help on how to go through it.
**Speaker 1**: Just regarding like how.
**Speaker 1**: How would you like me to check if everything is is done?
**Speaker 1**: Because he did mention like some things he already paid for.
**Speaker 1**: But I don't have access to everything to like.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: But this is just like physical mail, that's what you're saying?
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: This is physical mail?
**Speaker 1**: Yes.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Well that's A good question.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So I don't actually do the physical mail for them.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: But.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: But what do you need exactly?
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Like to know if it's like what do we need to check?
**Speaker 1**: Or I guess like, like as of right now, what I've gone through, I have like invoice notices.
**Speaker 1**: But for example, he did, he did mention that he paid like for example, like this toll pass.
**Speaker 1**: He ended up saying like he paid for it.
**Speaker 1**: I was wondering if on Notion, if I go to Brandon Spending, can I find that he paid this?
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: No, you wouldn't be able to see.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Actually.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Yeah, actually that's a good question.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: If you go to Notion, you should be able to see that.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: And if you don't see that, well, I'm going to add you right now to our accounting team.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So once you're in county, so you will ask them like, hey guys, can you, can we please make sure that this was paid?
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Ah, okay.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Usually I do that too.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Like hey guys, can we check this?
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So let me just ask.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Because I've only gone through just a bit of the mail as of right now.
**Speaker 1**: There was a lot of trash, but there are some like government documents as well.
**Speaker 1**: Like just regarding, like this is a 1099 for non employee like.
**Speaker 1**: Com.
**Speaker 1**: Like these are just employee like copies.
**Speaker 1**: So I was gonna ask you if you wanted me to keep these and then just put and like scan them over to you.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Okay.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: If you want to scan them.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: But what does it.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Can you show me a picture?
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Maybe you can just.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: If you can you turn off, turn on your screen and maybe show it to me.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Because I don't know if we can.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Oh yeah, yeah.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Who is interrupting you?
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Jesse?
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: We are Jesse.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: So as of, as of my.
**Speaker 1**: He was asking about lunch.
**Speaker 1**: I'm gonna take a lunch in, in a little bit, maybe like 20 minutes.
**Speaker 1**: So with my camera, I try to turn it on.
**Speaker 1**: I thought my camera was on for the longest time.
**Speaker 1**: It doesn't seem to be.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: It's okay.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So maybe if you want to take a picture and just show me what it is so maybe we can figure it out and if you are not certain on everything, you can just ask Jessie or run like, hey, this is this, is this important?
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Or do we have like a pile of trash things and a pile of important things or you know, things like that so we can ask them.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I honestly think I may just, maybe I'll just send you like a scanned, like an email with some scanned copies for you just to quickly skim through it.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Yes, I feel like that will be.
**Speaker 1**: Maybe the easiest because a lot of.
**Speaker 1**: A lot of this mail is all from like the.
**Speaker 1**: It's all from Indiana.
**Speaker 1**: The Indiana office.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So none of it, I don't believe was meant for here.
**Speaker 1**: So I feel like a lot of it is from July too.
**Speaker 1**: Like the beginning of July.
**Speaker 1**: Like, for example, I have something here from the irs, the Department of Treasury.
**Speaker 1**: It seems to be like all accounting.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Accounting.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Did you open it already?
**Speaker 1**: I'm opening it right now.
**Speaker 1**: It says like, oh, this is nothing.
**Speaker 1**: I guess this is.
**Speaker 1**: It's like we determined your 2025 direct requirement deposit requirements for Form 941, and it just says balance of zero.
**Speaker 1**: So I'm going to just assume this is trash.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Yeah, don't worry.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: I mean, if you don't see anything important.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: For example, if, you know, if you don't see something that says immediate action of payment or something like that, or something that can be like, you know, for example, sometimes we might receive some invoices from our subcontractors or things like that.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So if you see like an important check, if you see money, or if you see something like that super important, or if you see something that says due date and it's already passed, so that's important.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: But if it's something like, you know, like you unnotice or something, that is.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Is not important.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Even there are a lot of, like a lot of this mail is also copies.
**Speaker 1**: Like it just says copy for recipient.
**Speaker 1**: Did you want me to go ahead and scan these later on today?
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Yeah, if you want to scan.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So copy to recipient.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: But this is just a copy of what.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Of what they were saying.
**Speaker 1**: For example, this is a copy of the payers federal.
**Speaker 1**: This is miscellaneous for 2023, Form 1099, miscellaneous information, Alito group.
**Speaker 1**: It just says like other income 5000 with the identification number ending in 7190.
**Speaker 1**: But that's just the information they give me.
**Speaker 1**: And like the other one says, like other income, 46,000.
**Speaker 1**: So I was just wondering if this is something that's important just to keep.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: That's a good question.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Can you ask Brandon on that?
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Because honestly, on mail I have not.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: I don't know exactly what to.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: You know.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So then I could probably just send him an email regarding, like my questions and copy you in it.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Yeah, and copy me exactly.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Perfect.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: And then if he's just like, maria, can you take a look?
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: We'll just call you and be like, okay, let's figure this out.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Now you remind me something.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So you did Actually, your.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Your background check, correct?
**Speaker 1**: Yes, I did do my background check.
**Speaker 1**: I sent you.
**Speaker 1**: It was, I sent you.
**Speaker 1**: It was a scheduled email for this morning.
**Speaker 1**: I think I was.
**Speaker 1**: I think it sent out after I saw the email you sent me.
**Speaker 1**: It was just.
**Speaker 1**: It had a screenshot of the last page of me submitting the last documents.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So I want to show you something.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So for order background checks.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Well, I don't know if you'll be doing background checks.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Maybe I can just do it because it's super simple.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: But this is just a place that we go and we usually select a package which is number three, which is like multi county just to make sure that it's like no sexual offenders, no jail.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: No.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Or probably like you know, your history.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Ah, yes.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So I want to see.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Because I asked screening so view orders.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: No, it seems that your hasn't been already added to application link view request.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: No, yours is still pending though.
**Speaker 1**: Yes, I mean I did go into it yesterday to double check.
**Speaker 1**: I uploaded everything and then my, my two.
**Speaker 1**: Only one image was uploaded and I was missing two.
**Speaker 1**: So then last night was when I guess was it fully submitted?
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Okay, so let's wait for it because usually we receive like a report from Visa from this place saying Ashley already sent her report.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So you can see here that we ask everybody to do a background check and then if you want to see, for example, their screening reports.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Green is good, red is something is weird.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Like something they found something on the report.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: For example, Jack, which wasn't like a big thing.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: He was just, you know, like in jail for.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: No, I wasn't in jail.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: He was just like speeding tickets, something like that, you know.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: But usually green is like they're completely clean and then red is like questionable, you know.
**Speaker 1**: Oh yeah.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So just for you to know.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So when they're questionable, I usually share.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: You know what, actually I need to add you here, Brandon and Jesse in Ashley.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Let me add you here, Ashley, to our.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Because we do have these, these chats with the, with them.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: But I'm going to add you right now.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So let's include all your history so you know everything Ashley Ortiz at.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Okay, so you're being added to here.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So everything I asked.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So usually for example, when it's questionable, I download their PDF because you can go here to the order and download the, you know, their report.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: And then once I share them here and be like, hey guys, this is the report from Jackie.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Can we take a look?
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: And then Jesse and Brandon are like, no.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Or this is good or this is too bad or let's just have a call.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So for example, this one Brandon was like, okay, let's call him right now and see what's going on.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: But things like that.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Yeah.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So yeah, I just wanted to see.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: But you're still like pending.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So let's see if maybe tomorrow or later today I receive like, like your ceasing process.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: And if not, just let me know.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Okay.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: We maybe have to resend that to you again.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, no problem.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Because expired dates in one day.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I did remember it again.
**Speaker 1**: Expiring on Tuesday.
**Speaker 1**: I was going to ask you.
**Speaker 1**: Maybe I could just call them and see like, oh, was it submitted this and that because there was no submit button at the end.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: If it doesn't happen, I can ask them.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Don't worry.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: I have a contact with the cream check person in.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: I'll ccu.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Don't worry for like.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, okay, great.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Yeah.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Ashley.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Cream check.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Cream check.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: What was the name of that car?
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: I forgot.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: No, this is not Brianna.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: This is set up, but this is not with Brianna.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Rosa Rosita is the person that is helping us.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So I can talk to Rosa in case.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: If anything is not working.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So I'll ask Rosa if they can, you know, help me with, you know, with that.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Okay.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So what is this?
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: I have a bunch of stuff to do.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Text person Lito WC PTO for Kevin Mass.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Good morning, Maria.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Okay, sounds good.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Good.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Travel requested pto.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Good morning, Keva.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Okay, that's good.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Okay, perfect.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So don't worry, I will try to keep you on the loop on everything usually that I do so you can see everything that we do.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So for example, recently we ordered a new business envelopes because Brandon told me that the envelopes that I requested, the window, cellophane window, was too big for return addresses and blah, blah, blah.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: And there was a problem and etc.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So we just do that.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Business cards and everything.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: I think I would have to order you business.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: I don't know if I.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Business card, business car business.
**Speaker 1**: I see the groups you added me in.
**Speaker 1**: Thank you so much.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: That.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Which one?
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: With Jesse and you.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I saw.
**Speaker 1**: Well, I'm.
**Speaker 1**: I'm just now like opening teams because I was just like on our meeting and I was watching your screen, but I just saw like the STP Florida office.
**Speaker 1**: I just saw the accounting team, marketing and Brandon, Jesse and Maria.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: If you have questions for us, for example, you can actually scan the envelopes, send it to the four of us and be like, you know, our chat and be like, hey guys, this, this, you know, like this check is important.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Or not.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So we get to know everything.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Okay, perfect.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Instead of send it only to me.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So this chat that you know, Jesse, Brandon, you and myself, whenever you have questions, if you have, just send them to there.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Now your next, next task please is please go to Amazon Business, try to find your mouse, the mouse that you want.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: And please try to find a nice, this receptionist desk for you.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Once you have it, please let me know so I can take a look and then we'll share with the guys.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: If they want to approve, I'll just go ahead and pay for it.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, beautiful.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I'll go ahead and find some options of the desk and mouse.
**Speaker 1**: So I can go ahead and send you an email with also Jesse and Brandon in it.
**Speaker 1**: As well.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: All right, that's wonderful.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Exactly.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: And everything.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: And then if a.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: And then once he's ready for purchase, I'll call you and I'll be like, hey, let's purchase this together so I can show you how to do it and then how to link.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: You know, everything is already linked with Brandon's car.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: But just to show you how it works.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Okay.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: And then once you receive your car, well, I'll let you know.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: And you usually, you know, oh, my God.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: But to what address was sent to Indianapolis, right?
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Yeah, it's okay because we can send it via FedEx.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: That's okay.
**Speaker 1**: Sounds good.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: I was also going to ask like, do you.
**Speaker 1**: Do you know, or maybe I should ask Jesse how the packages work to this location.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Well, so apparently.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Yeah, that's a good question that you should ask Jesse because It seems that FedEx actually entered the office and leave the packages.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: But I'm not sure.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So because it seems that that's a problem with the office building, blah, blah, blah, et cetera.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So if you can take care of it as well, like, hey, how packages are being managed here?
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So they will be like, oh, no, they opened it to us.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Or so you can be aware of it.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: And then.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, and I can go ahead and do that once I get my account for the building, once I get that field building account, I can go ahead and reach out.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Yeah, you can reach out.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: And then.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Because right now they don't know who you are.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: I just want to make sure they know that you are the office manager.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So once they understand that once you have access to the portal, once you have everything, then you can actually reach out or actually ask Jesse right now how the packages are being managed right now.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: And if there are questions, just go ahead and go to the Franklin Building administration or and just ask them.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: You know, you can reach out, like, hey, can you please help me understand the packages?
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Our FedEx guys, come here.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Do we have a P.O.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: box?
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Do we have things like that?
**Speaker 1**: Okay, perfect.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Thank you so much, Maria.
**Speaker 1**: That's amazing.
**Speaker 1**: Awesome.
**Speaker 1**: Well, thank you so much.
**Speaker 1**: Do you have any more questions for.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Me or anything like that?
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Don't worry.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: No, I don't have any questions.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: But I know, you know, during the meantime and during the week, we will have a lot of time, things to work on, and if I.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: If I will require your help, definitely I will let you know.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: And then just, you know, just to let you know, hey, Ashley, we need to order this again.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Can you please manage these or things like that to give you more freedom as well?
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: And then if you have questions to me, let me know.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: And then welcome to a little group.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: You're gonna love it.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: And the next task, actually, that we have to do, so don't forget business.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Amazon business for your desk.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: And right now, Brandon told me over the weekend, he said, hey, please gather with Ashley.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: He says we need to start thinking about the company end of the year party.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Need you and Ashley to start working on how we pull that off with everyone in the company.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So I asked him what they do usually, and he said, usually burgers, hot dogs, and grill.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So we just need to have that in mind.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Okay.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: That we need to maybe add.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Order some of the things for the team, and we need to make sure everybody's available, you know, at the end of the year for a party.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, perfect.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So just.

**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So let me just.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Wait, Let me just share this one second.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, great.
**Speaker 1**: Yes.
**Speaker 1**: And then also.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, yeah, if.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: If anything, let me know.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Okay?
**Speaker 1**: Yes.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: And then we'll be in touch.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: All right.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, sounds good.
**Speaker 1**: I'll go ahead and log into the Amazon and take a look myself.
**Speaker 1**: Perfect.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Play and let me know.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: And I'm just logging in.
**Speaker 1**: I'm not creating my own account yet.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: No.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Remember that the login is on the login master sheet.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: So if you go to the master sheet, you will find business.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Amazon business.
**Ashleyleeortiz1**: Okay, perfect.
**Speaker 1**: Thank you so much, Maria.
