## Transcript
**Mcalcetero**: Hello.
**Fnjie**: Hey, guys.
**Justin**: How's it going?
**Fnjie**: Well, how are you?
**Justin**: Doing good.
**Mcalcetero**: Doing good.
**Mcalcetero**: All right.
**Fnjie**: Not sure.
**Fnjie**: I.
**Fnjie**: I just saw this meeting hit my calendar, so I'm sure you guys probably been working with Fatima and Maria.
**Justin**: No, we haven't been working with.
**Justin**: With anyone yet.
**Justin**: We got an email.
**Justin**: Was it last week?
**Justin**: I'm in from just Justin.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Justin**: All right.
**Fnjie**: So Justin's the connection.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Justin**: Justin hit us up and said, I guess the company knew potentially a Tennessee project they were doing from a license perspective.
**Justin**: And so.
**Bclymer**: He.
**Justin**: He connected with us.
**Justin**: I'm.
**Justin**: And I obviously work on a lot of.
**Justin**: A lot of audit clients and so wanted to kind of talk through what you guys needed, what you guys have done in the past, and we can certainly throw together a quote for you guys and.
**Justin**: And get rolling and help you out.
**Fnjie**: Well, I see Justin's on here, so he's probably better to handle this than me, but.
**Fnjie**: Yeah, so basically, yes.
**Fnjie**: I mean, the audit that is required for the state license, you know, I think it's.
**Fnjie**: We got to show like, I don't know, like that if.
**Fnjie**: 300,000 working capital or something.
**Fnjie**: Justin.
**Fnjie**: I think something like that.
**Fnjie**: Yeah, it's.
**Fnjie**: It's on the thing.
**Fnjie**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: How you doing, Chris and Amon?
**Justin**: Good.
**Justin**: How are you, Justin?
**Bclymer**: Good, good.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: There's a working capital requirement that the state's looking for.
**Bclymer**: I sent the request over to you, Amon and Chris.
**Bclymer**: To be honest, I haven't had much exposure and g.
**Bclymer**: Like, GC licenses asking for something so thorough.
**Bclymer**: That's a little bit of a surprise for me.
**Bclymer**: I've gotten, you know, I've seen that a lot, but an audit's pretty crazy.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, they wanted a working capital.
**Bclymer**: They wanted audited financials, so I sent that over to you guys to take a look at, too.
**Justin**: Yeah, I've had a couple other contractors that we do work for.
**Justin**: They.
**Justin**: The 10.
**Justin**: If they do work in Tennessee, you know, sometimes they.
**Justin**: They do ask for an audit.
**Justin**: So that's a weird.
**Justin**: It's a weird state licensing situation.
**Justin**: But, yeah, we.
**Justin**: I've seen it before.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And so we.
**Bclymer**: Brandon, I spoke with Avon a little bit on just kind of the timeline.
**Bclymer**: You know, I reached out to Moss Adams because I know you guys obviously have bandwidth and, you know, reputation in construction.
**Bclymer**: So Fatima and I are on this internally.
**Bclymer**: We've been kind of working hand in hand for 20 foreclosure for the prior years.
**Bclymer**: Brandon, you're working with CBIZ, right?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: So we may need to interface with them.
**Bclymer**: But, yeah, I mean, Brandon's Kind of looking to expedite this as much as possible because there's a job on the line here that is a very good job for, for Brandon.
**Justin**: Sure.
**Justin**: Makes sense.
**Justin**: Makes sense.
**Fnjie**: Yeah.
**Fnjie**: So it's.
**Fnjie**: Sorry, it's the middle of the night here.
**Fnjie**: I'm, I'm in Dubai right now.
**Fnjie**: But yeah, if, if you guys can look at that and I guess, I don't know, you know, how quickly you can turn around a quote and really the, the timeline is, is crucial for us to, to see how quickly we can get everything turned around.
**Fnjie**: You know, me not being an accountant, I have no idea what goes into that.
**Justin**: Yeah, all good.
**Justin**: One of the things we told Justin is, you know, if we can get, you know, either some internal financial statements, probably if you haven't been audited, or have you guys had a review in the past or anything?
**Justin**: No.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Justin**: So I mean, if we can probably get internal financial statements, Justin, for probably 24 and 23, because we're going to need to get comfortable with the opening balance sheet, right.
**Justin**: As if they've never been audited before.
**Justin**: If we can get that information and then also maybe their prior year tax return, then we can kind of give Brandon a quote of.
**Justin**: We can turn.
**Justin**: We could probably look at that today, Brandon, and let you know what we think pricing is pretty quickly, you know, from a timing perspective.
**Justin**: You know, Justin, I mean, I think it probably, we probably need to.
**Justin**: We can put together a PBC list pretty quickly based on what we see on the, on the statements.
**Justin**: And then I think we probably want to talk to you as far as, hey, how quickly can you get, you know, some of this stuff together for us?
**Justin**: Because I mean, we have some clients where it'll take a week.
**Justin**: Right.
**Justin**: We also have to send out confirmations, right.
**Justin**: And do all those other sorts of things for an audit.
**Justin**: So we don't want to start too early.
**Justin**: Right.
**Justin**: Where we're inefficient and we're, we're costing branded money.
**Justin**: But we also want to.
**Justin**: As soon as, as soon as you're ready, Justin, we can get going, right?
**Justin**: We have, we have the bandwidth to get going in April and we can knock it out here pretty quickly.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Fnjie**: Yeah, I would say we could probably get most that stuff today.
**Fnjie**: I mean, I don't think there's anything unless Fatima, you tell me differently, you can pull all those reports from Acumatica, right?
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, but Brandon, when is the deadline?
**Mcalcetero**: When, when does the state of Tennessee needs the, the audited financial statement?
**Fnjie**: That's.
**Fnjie**: We need that to, to send in our application.
**Fnjie**: So, I mean, we're like, that's the thing.
**Fnjie**: We have to have.
**Fnjie**: Like, so we've already got the license, the test passed, and we've got all the application stuff.
**Fnjie**: It's just, you know, we got to get this, this one piece figured out.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Mcalcetero**: You know, like, you know, I think, Justin, as, as Chris mentioned, we can turn around as quickly as, you know, as the information is provided.
**Mcalcetero**: Getting the internal financial statement to get us a sense of how complex the balance sheet and, you know, like, if you have a couple, you know, like, if it's a simple financial statement, just helps us plan ahead.
**Mcalcetero**: You know, availability wise, we don't have much, but we can throw some, you know, you know, like move things around and, and make things happen, but we don't want to move and then stop and move and then stop.
**Mcalcetero**: So you guys let us know how.
**Mcalcetero**: How you would like to proceed and would love to help.
**Mcalcetero**: You know, as I told Justin, I think we can also look at the tax return.
**Mcalcetero**: There's a lot of tax incentives that are popular for our contract client that we can just help see if we can, you know, look into this, maybe switch you from a particular method to another method.
**Mcalcetero**: We have a pretty solid tech construction practice here in the firm that we, we think we always can help.
**Justin**: Brandon, how, Brandon, how big are you guys about revenue wise?
**Justin**: What's.
**Fnjie**: We'll do 20 million, 25 million this year.
**Justin**: And then you'll just ball around what type of, what type of construction you guys.
**Fnjie**: Commercial design build.
**Justin**: Okay, have you guys looked at all from a tax perspective?
**Justin**: Have you guys looked into the R D tax credits?
**Bclymer**: Nope.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Justin**: Yeah.
**Justin**: So with you guys doing design build work, a lot of times that type of work will qualify for a dollar for dollar credit for tax purposes.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah.
**Justin**: So that's something that we can kind of.
**Justin**: We can kind of look into after we get done with the audit.
**Justin**: And, and it might be an opportunity there to save you some money.
**Justin**: For 24.
**Fnjie**: Yeah, that'd be great.
**Justin**: For 24.
**Justin**: Taxes still.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: No, Brandon, No.
**Bclymer**: Anytime I brought Chris and Amon into a solution.
**Bclymer**: They've.
**Bclymer**: It's probably one of the best contacts I have from.
**Bclymer**: From a value add standpoint.
**Bclymer**: So they'll be able to help us.
**Bclymer**: Perfect.
**Justin**: So, yeah, let's.
**Fnjie**: I'm not happy with cbiz, so I'm happy, you know, I want to look for somebody else to do my taxes for last.
**Justin**: Brandon, where are you.
**Justin**: Where are you based?
**Justin**: Where are you physically based?
**Justin**: Out of Florida.
**Fnjie**: We have an office in St.
**Fnjie**: Pete, an office in Indianapolis, so I split time between the two.
**Justin**: Okay, but your home, like my, My driver's.
**Fnjie**: Yeah, my, my driver's license is Florida, so I'm.
**Fnjie**: This year I'm switching it to my residency being Florida for state taxes.
**Justin**: Excellent.
**Justin**: Okay.
**Mcalcetero**: And from a project standpoint, Brandon, all of your projects are in Tennessee.
**Fnjie**: No, all our projects are different states across the country.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay.
**Justin**: And then, Justin, they have a pretty.
**Justin**: You asking you this question you have.
**Justin**: They have a pretty good WHIP schedule.
**Justin**: How well are they dialed in from a, you know, percent complete perspective?
**Bclymer**: They're dialed in.
**Justin**: Okay, good.
**Justin**: We see some small contractors that are.
**Justin**: Are not dialed in.
**Justin**: So that's why I asked the question.
**Bclymer**: Fatima, Am I speaking out of turn?
**Jdawson**: No, you're right.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: No, the whip style then.
**Bclymer**: 24 is about close.
**Bclymer**: There's some credit card stuff that we had to bring in.
**Bclymer**: But on the job standpoint, I mean, we're good.
**Justin**: How are the.
**Justin**: How are the job.
**Justin**: How, how.
**Justin**: A profitability perspective.
**Justin**: How the job's doing Pretty good.
**Fnjie**: Yeah.
**Fnjie**: I mean, we should do.
**Fnjie**: I mean, 15% net this year, I'd say.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Brandon.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, Brandon's good at what he does and we don't run it like a small business.
**Bclymer**: He's pretty tech forward too.
**Bclymer**: So from like, you know, standpoint of how things are looking, whip report, all that, it's good.
**Bclymer**: He uses, um, we're on jobber now for the job costing, project management side of things.
**Bclymer**: And he just implemented something on the AP credit card.
**Bclymer**: I forgot the name was Inspira.
**Fnjie**: Notion.
**Jdawson**: Notion.
**Bclymer**: Notion.
**Jdawson**: There we go.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So, but yeah, Chris, generally the these, they're in, they're in a good place.
**Bclymer**: And we'll get you guys, Fatima, please, at highest urgency, get them 24 and 23 through the system and then tax returns for 22 and 23.
**Bclymer**: Is that a good starting point, Chris and Amon?
**Fnjie**: Yeah.

**Jdawson**: Should be.
