## Transcript
**Luke**: As like the microphone.
**Luke**: It still doesn't factor in the DJ cost.
**Luke**: Sometimes it can be, you know, all sorts of numbers.
**Luke**: Yeah.
**Luke**: I don't know how to feel about.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Has to be you.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I'm sorry.
**Luke**: It has to be me.
**Luke**: Yeah.
**Eileeniglesias2**: You're ready.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Just put your hat in.
**Luke**: That's it.
**Luke**: That's it.
**Luke**: I'll have to.
**Luke**: It's me.
**Luke**: Yeah.
**Luke**: I'm DJing me place.
**Luke**: I haven't DJed in so long, I wouldn't even know what to do.
**Luke**: I think they'd like a month ago, so it's fine.
**Samanthaleigh840**: So.
**Luke**: Yes.
**Luke**: Yeah.
**Luke**: Pretty much wanted to go through and talk about.
**Luke**: I wish the girls were.
**Luke**: I wish we could all get it.
**Luke**: Get a time.
**Luke**: Maybe tomorrow or something like that.
**Luke**: Other than this one.
**Luke**: Yeah.
**Luke**: I just want to.
**Luke**: Want to chat with Brandon and just make sure he's kind of knows what happened last party, knows what happened, this party, why it's going to be different and then kind of just.
**Luke**: Just get every.
**Luke**: Everyone on.
**Luke**: On board just a little bit.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah, I'm asking him if he's doing the meeting and also let me text on the.
**Eileeniglesias2**: On the chat.
**Luke**: The link.
**Luke**: Yeah, for sure.
**Luke**: And.
**Luke**: And then Luke as well.
**Luke**: I haven't.
**Luke**: I haven't seen.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yes, I need him too, because he hasn't.
**Luke**: I haven't seen.
**Luke**: Lukey boy.
**Luke**: Yeah, we just.
**Luke**: We just want no yelling at different people.
**Luke**: That's not an effective thing.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yep, yep, it's true.
**Luke**: Hey, George Clooney, he liked that one, didn't he?
**Samanthaleigh840**: I thought that was funny.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah.
**Samanthaleigh840**: I was sexy and wine.
**Eileeniglesias2**: That's it.
**Samanthaleigh840**: I was at the bank depositing checks and I'm like, what the hell are they talking about?
**Luke**: That's it.
**Luke**: We're doing a full section.
**Luke**: All right, let's get into it now.
**Luke**: You got 30 minutes.
**Luke**: Unless you got 30 minutes.
**Luke**: Is that 30 minutes of time or what do you got?
**Samanthaleigh840**: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I got another.
**Samanthaleigh840**: I got another meeting.
**Samanthaleigh840**: I was in another one first, so.
**Luke**: Okay.
**Luke**: Awesome.
**Luke**: Yeah, I just want to come on board.
**Luke**: Obviously I don't think the girls are, because it was a bit impromptu, but I'll come on here and we can kind of get sort of sorted and everything and hear everything.
**Luke**: First of all, I want to talk about the other party.
**Luke**: That's the first thing I want to talk about in terms of that.
**Luke**: And I think it might have been a bit of a misrepresentation of what.
**Luke**: Did you talk to Tiggs about what happened with that party, by the way?
**Samanthaleigh840**: Yeah, I mean, he was like, you know, I mean.
**Samanthaleigh840**: And I You know, I get it.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Like, he just, he was like, oh, well, it's because, you know, this girl, you know, didn't invite her friends and stuff.
**Samanthaleigh840**: You know, I'm like, dude, I'm like, I'm like, well, no, he did like, they were, you know, like, I don't know.
**Samanthaleigh840**: I mean, maybe so like, he said that they didn't.
**Samanthaleigh840**: They had a huge.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Like.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Because I was talking about it, which again, I'm only.
**Samanthaleigh840**: I don't know how much work he actually, actually did.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Like, they were saying that they did all this work and everything.
**Samanthaleigh840**: And then like, I'm like, dude, the numbers.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Like, you had a hundred girls on the list.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Like, yeah, 30 showed up at best.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Like, you can't tell me 70 of them were on from this one chick.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Like, it was like maybe 10, you know, 10 or 10 or 20 of her friends at best.
**Samanthaleigh840**: And Right.
**Samanthaleigh840**: You know, so I, I think, you know, so, so with that is, is coding it, you know, in a way, you know, to not take responsibility for.
**Luke**: Sure.
**Luke**: Yeah.
**Luke**: No, 100%.
**Luke**: The reason why is because I was involved in that party as well.
**Luke**: That's why.
**Luke**: So I was kind of like mentoring them a little bit, being like, what to do because it was with the Ingmar stuff.
**Luke**: But I will say that we learned two, two valuable things from that.
**Luke**: Number one, don't use posh.
**Luke**: Use part of all.
**Luke**: And number two, posh.
**Luke**: Fuck them, basically.
**Luke**: So we can't use that at all.
**Luke**: Part of full.
**Luke**: And then that girl.
**Luke**: So the difference between your one is that the single point of failure that they have was that Lyn girl.
**Luke**: Does that make sense?
**Luke**: Yeah, that's where you don't have this with this event.
**Luke**: Just, just so you know, there's like multiple points, if that makes sense.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Yeah, I mean, I, I again, I can, I, I see what you're saying and everything.
**Samanthaleigh840**: I disagree.
**Samanthaleigh840**: I don't ever think it's just.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Oh, it was just all lit.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Like, I think there's definitely thing like, again, like maybe the, the effort wasn't put in or this that the other.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Like, Sure.
**Samanthaleigh840**: I don't know.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Like, but I, I, I always look at everything that I do is like, I, I highly doubt it's just all because of this one contingent.
**Luke**: Sure.
**Luke**: Yeah, 100%.
**Luke**: Well, it was, it was a bit of everything when you don't have the control over the list, which we have the control.
**Luke**: So basically it comes down to it's like, are we good to go?
**Luke**: Are we set?
**Luke**: Just so everybody's clear.
**Luke**: Because the video kind of what I said was basically like.
**Luke**: I. I felt in the mud.
**Luke**: I was just like, what.
**Luke**: What are we doing?
**Luke**: You know what I mean?
**Samanthaleigh840**: Yeah.
**Samanthaleigh840**: I mean, Luke and I talked the other night.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Like, or last night or the night before.
**Samanthaleigh840**: I can't remember in the morning.
**Luke**: What.
**Samanthaleigh840**: It doesn't matter.
**Samanthaleigh840**: And yeah, we.
**Samanthaleigh840**: We both said like, well, it looks like the red door place, right?
**Samanthaleigh840**: And said, all right, well, let's pull the trigger.
**Samanthaleigh840**: You know, now you know, as far as.
**Samanthaleigh840**: And then we.
**Samanthaleigh840**: We talked about.
**Samanthaleigh840**: I was like, well, it's like, do we have.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Should we.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Like, is it too close?
**Samanthaleigh840**: Like, should we bump into September?
**Samanthaleigh840**: You know, like the second week of September, you know, to.
**Samanthaleigh840**: To give more time for marketing, you know.
**Samanthaleigh840**: And I.
**Samanthaleigh840**: And it's like I'm also.
**Samanthaleigh840**: I was also kind of thinking.
**Samanthaleigh840**: I was like, man, it is a.
**Samanthaleigh840**: A hundred degrees outside right now.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Like, you know, okay.
**Samanthaleigh840**: You know, so that's just a thought, you know, because again, I don't know how long it takes.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Like, I don't know if, you know, what we have is enough time.
**Samanthaleigh840**: But yeah, I mean, we're both.
**Samanthaleigh840**: We're both down.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Like, you know, just again, like, my thing was like.
**Samanthaleigh840**: I was like, you know, I felt so bad, you know, because I've been there so many times where like you pay all this money and people just don't deliver and it.
**Samanthaleigh840**: And I was like, I felt bad for.
**Samanthaleigh840**: For Ingmar because He spent whatever 10 grand plus a bunch of other shit.
**Samanthaleigh840**: And it's just kind of like it was like, come on.
**Luke**: Yeah, 100%.
**Luke**: Well, the good thing about that.
**Luke**: I will give you that was a.
**Luke**: We were running that as the pre party for his party on September 1, by the way, so that.
**Luke**: I know it was almost a thing, but.
**Luke**: And it's good because we learned from that.
**Luke**: That can really help you.
**Luke**: So I'll give you.
**Luke**: I'll give you.
**Luke**: I'll give you my two cents.
**Luke**: Three weeks.
**Luke**: It's pushing it for sure.
**Luke**: I'm just going to speak honestly.
**Luke**: Three weeks is pushing it.
**Luke**: If that makes sense.
**Luke**: We can do it 100.
**Luke**: I just want it to be perfect.
**Luke**: And it can be perfect in three weeks.
**Luke**: But second week of September would.
**Luke**: Would allow us more time for sure.
**Luke**: 100.
**Samanthaleigh840**: I mean, I. I don't again.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Unless you tell me there's like a reason not to to, you know, again.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Because like we just picked that date to pick a date.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Like, okay.
**Samanthaleigh840**: You know, but like if you've ever smiled.
**Luke**: 100 degrees as well.
**Luke**: That's.
**Luke**: That's an interesting thing that I Didn't consider, obviously, because it's, you know, Tampa, and.
**Luke**: Is September a better kind of cooler?
**Samanthaleigh840**: Oh, yeah.
**Samanthaleigh840**: So this is.
**Samanthaleigh840**: I don't know if you.
**Samanthaleigh840**: If you notice or anything, but we are literally record heat right now.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Like, it's 100 degrees.
**Luke**: I saw that.
**Samanthaleigh840**: It's a.
**Luke**: It's.
**Samanthaleigh840**: It's unreal.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Like, I.
**Samanthaleigh840**: It's crazy.
**Luke**: Yeah.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Breaking.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Shit's breaking down, and it's like, you know, if we want to do an indoor outdoor thing, like.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Yeah.
**Samanthaleigh840**: I mean, it's still fucking 85, 90 degrees at night.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Like, it's crazy.
**Luke**: So.
**Luke**: So based on that, based of everything we've got, I think a good executive decision is to move it to September.
**Luke**: Yeah.
**Luke**: If you.
**Luke**: You're saying, like, if you're having record heat, we've got three weeks.
**Luke**: We had a bit of, like, you know, we were all over the place.
**Luke**: I think if we gave ourselves a couple of weeks, it's the smartest thing that we could do.
**Luke**: All right.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Perfect.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Yeah.
**Samanthaleigh840**: So then we'll do it, you know, after either Labor Day, and then you've got, you know, I don't think anything for the next couple weekends.
**Samanthaleigh840**: So maybe, like, maybe not the weekend.
**Luke**: After Labor Day, because the weekend off.
**Luke**: The weekend after the week end of.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Exactly.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Yeah.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Two weeks after Labor Day because then people are going to be recouped.
**Luke**: Okay.
**Luke**: So that.
**Luke**: That's a really good time, and I think that's really good for that, honestly.
**Luke**: You know, honestly, I think that's.
**Luke**: If it's cooler, plus we're able to go everything.
**Luke**: So, Maria, what we'll have to do is just go through everything and just change everything.
**Luke**: We've got nothing in.
**Luke**: In.
**Luke**: In order.
**Luke**: So we would just have to get the girls to go back and see if that place is still available as well.
**Samanthaleigh840**: I would.
**Samanthaleigh840**: I would think it would.
**Luke**: Yeah.
**Luke**: I mean.
**Luke**: I mean, we were.
**Luke**: We were doing it within three weeks, so I should be.
**Luke**: It should be fine.
**Luke**: That's cool.
**Luke**: Yeah.
**Samanthaleigh840**: So we're talking.
**Samanthaleigh840**: So the.
**Samanthaleigh840**: So the first is Labor Day, so everybody will be doing stuff that week.
**Samanthaleigh840**: That.
**Samanthaleigh840**: That's a Monday.
**Luke**: Yep.
**Samanthaleigh840**: And so then the.
**Samanthaleigh840**: It would be.
**Samanthaleigh840**: The 13th would be two weeks.
**Luke**: Yeah.
**Luke**: Yes.
**Luke**: Yeah, absolutely.
**Luke**: At the first.
**Luke**: The September 1st is a Monday.
**Luke**: So you'll.
**Luke**: Is that a pub?
**Luke**: Like, is that a public holiday for you guys or the Tuesdays?
**Samanthaleigh840**: Yeah, that's, I think.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Is it.
**Samanthaleigh840**: I think it's Labor Day.
**Luke**: Yeah.
**Samanthaleigh840**: So everybody's got it all.
**Samanthaleigh840**: It's a big.
**Samanthaleigh840**: It's a big weekend.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Like, oh, that's the weekend that those guys are having their thing.
**Luke**: Yeah, no, absolutely.
**Luke**: For sure.
**Luke**: And so then the 13th.
**Luke**: I think that's a really, really good time.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Yeah.
**Samanthaleigh840**: In reality.
**Samanthaleigh840**: And it could be the 13th or the 20th, you know, I mean, if you know, availability.
**Luke**: That's cool.
**Luke**: That's cool.
**Luke**: So we'll put contingency, 13th, 20th.
**Luke**: We're happy with whatever dates.
**Luke**: It's getting cooler every week, so that's pretty much fine as well.
**Samanthaleigh840**: It will.
**Samanthaleigh840**: August will be, you know, the hottest and then it'll start tapering.
**Luke**: Yeah, for sure.
**Luke**: Okay, cool.
**Luke**: Fantastic.
**Luke**: Awesome.
**Luke**: Then the things in terms of the budgeting we've worked on, I don't know if you've seen the sheet.
**Luke**: We're really trying to work there.
**Luke**: And so we will get those down in the back end basically in the back of me and Maria working together just to get everything kind of sorted.
**Luke**: So a lot of it is sorted.
**Luke**: Marie, is there anything that Brandon kind of needs to know about any of the backend stuff that we're doing or.
**Luke**: It's pretty.
**Eileeniglesias2**: No, I think you guys are.
**Eileeniglesias2**: You saw the budget, right?
**Eileeniglesias2**: The new spread, I mean the spreadsheet and then the budget revision.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So now.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So everything is there.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yes.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I'm in myself are being like calling, changing and stuff, making sure we have like the best in terms of budget for you guys.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So yeah, I mean we're just working on it on the back end, but I don't think it's anything else.
**Eileeniglesias2**: We just need to confirm with the girls, you know, the extra things that maybe they have, but that's it.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Yeah.
**Samanthaleigh840**: And yeah, as far as like the marketing and stuff, you know, kind of like I said, you know, I don't know enough about that to, to know what a good budget is, to be honest.
**Luke**: You know, that's being taken care of.
**Luke**: I'll.
**Luke**: I'll take care of all the budgeting stuff.
**Luke**: I'm, I'm, I'm good at squeezing it.
**Luke**: I was telling Maria, I'm like, you know, fuck it, I'll DJ just to save.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah, I mean he sent me the picture.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I, you know, and I was like, that's perfect, that's good.
**Samanthaleigh840**: You actually have like a DJ setup or some shit.
**Luke**: Yeah, I DJed for like three years.
**Luke**: The only way I got into parties as a 16 year old.
**Luke**: 17, 18, 19.
**Luke**: So I just DJed.
**Luke**: Yeah, that's.
**Eileeniglesias2**: So let's do it.
**Luke**: Yeah, Marie, you can send, I'll send it in there.
**Luke**: And then I didn't know that.
**Samanthaleigh840**: That's super cool.
**Luke**: So I was Just like at the end of the day, it's like, if we scraping by.
**Luke**: And I was like, I can fucking do it.
**Luke**: I don't really care.
**Samanthaleigh840**: And it's.
**Samanthaleigh840**: I mean, I don't know how much a DJ costs, but I mean, it's.
**Luke**: Not like, it's not, it's not huge amounts.
**Luke**: We're looking at the production and yeah, we're just, we're trying to make it as good as possible for you.
**Luke**: So, yeah, yeah, we just.
**Samanthaleigh840**: So, I mean, again, and I don't, I don't want you to feel like you got to go and, you know, work, whatever.
**Samanthaleigh840**: I mean, we can pay, you know, a thousand or five hundred bucks for a dj, whatever that is.
**Luke**: So.
**Luke**: So, yeah, I'm trying to squeeze that to 20 as much.
**Luke**: And what, what I told Maria is we're going to be looking at alcohol sponsors to try to get alcohol here so we can lower the open budget.
**Luke**: The open.
**Samanthaleigh840**: That fucking chin.
**Luke**: Yeah.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Jay Leno.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Holy shit.
**Luke**: That's fucking hilarious.
**Samanthaleigh840**: That's so funny.
**Luke**: Yeah, no, hilarious.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Yeah.
**Luke**: When I shave it, I look like a kid again.
**Luke**: It's fucking hilarious.
**Luke**: But, yeah.
**Luke**: So basically, I think with a lot of the marketing and the budgets, the girls are very.
**Luke**: I know what they, what they're trying to do, and I think it's going to work as well, if that makes sense.
**Luke**: Like, they're, they're doing the strategy of like hyping it up, using model agencies, getting people in the content stuff.
**Luke**: And I think that's going to work.
**Luke**: I do have faith in that.
**Luke**: Just because it's like girls.
**Luke**: Girls know what other girls want.
**Luke**: Right.
**Luke**: A lot of the time makes sense.
**Luke**: And then from, from there specifically, the only things that we just.
**Luke**: I don't think we can.
**Luke**: We can't crash out anymore on everything.
**Luke**: We've got to be very, as a team, we got to be very kind of conciseive of, like, we.
**Luke**: I don't want us to have a lot of anxiety or stress around this, if that makes sense.
**Luke**: So the least amount, you can be stressed.
**Luke**: I know that you, you know, your job is stressful, but if we could do that and then everything.
**Luke**: I think what we can do is make better decisions as a, As a collective of, like, what we're going to do and for you, because I think everyone's on board with, like, they want to make your vision come true, which is.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Yeah, I mean, I guess if we, if you wanted, if you guys want to work behind the scenes and you can kind of take the lead and then really just when it's like, hey, we need major decisions.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Especially because, like.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Like, I'm about to go through underwriting.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Like, that's what part of the reason I'm so fucking stressed, like, for this billion dollar deal.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Like.
**Luke**: Yeah.
**Samanthaleigh840**: You know, and if you can imagine what underwriting is for a house, imagine what it is for a fucking billion dollars.
**Samanthaleigh840**: And so I've got, you know, that's going to be going on for the next month.
**Samanthaleigh840**: So.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Yeah, so it's going to take a lot of my time.
**Luke**: So.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Yeah, I mean, I think that's great.
**Samanthaleigh840**: And Luke, again, he.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Luke's very good with the flow.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Like, he'll.
**Samanthaleigh840**: He'll talk to me and, you know, kind of let me know what he thinks, but he's pretty much just whatever.
**Samanthaleigh840**: So.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Yeah, that's fine.
**Samanthaleigh840**: I mean, the biggest thing is, like, you know, as long as this is, you know, people show up and it's a good time.
**Samanthaleigh840**: I mean, like.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Like, really, that's what, you know, Luke and I said, we're like, you know what?
**Samanthaleigh840**: Like, it.
**Samanthaleigh840**: We're tired of, like, these events where people are not delivering, they're charging all, you know, these people money, and then they're not bringing anything, and everybody's just posing and, like, it's like, dude, let's just.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Everybody just wants to have a good time.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Let's just actually throw something for a good time.
**Samanthaleigh840**: No, no, you know, oh, well, it's the who's who of Tampa or whatever.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Like, it's just, like, just have a good time.
**Luke**: Yeah, for sure.
**Luke**: 100%.
**Luke**: And that's what.
**Luke**: That's what our plan is.
**Luke**: And I think.
**Luke**: I think we can definitely execute upon that for sure.
**Luke**: And I know that.
**Luke**: I think it would be tentative if we had it in August.
**Luke**: So September is a good move from there.
**Luke**: And basically go, Let me just look at everything.
**Luke**: So pretty much everything.
**Luke**: I think what I'll do is I'll come to you with, like, all right, so this stuff needs to be paid for.
**Luke**: This is all locked in.
**Luke**: We need this, this, and this.
**Luke**: And then that's the big decisions that I want to come to you and just get the final approval of.
**Luke**: You and Luke, I've been pretty much going to you, so I don't want to make Luke feel like he's not part of it.
**Luke**: But just so you know, it's just we've been coming.
**Samanthaleigh840**: He's fine.
**Samanthaleigh840**: He doesn't care.
**Samanthaleigh840**: He'll defer.
**Luke**: Awesome.
**Luke**: Yeah.
**Luke**: Awesome.
**Luke**: And then, yeah, pretty.
**Luke**: Pretty much that's kind of what I want to get unfortunately, the girls couldn't.
**Luke**: Come on.
**Luke**: We'll try to get a call with everybody as well on there again because I think we need that just to make sure that everyone's heard out.
**Luke**: I know that's stressful for, for everyone, but if we can make that happen, that would be, that would be really, really good as well.
**Luke**: Yeah, I, I honestly think we need everybody there.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Yeah, I'd say just post, you know, Maria set meetings, obviously, like, you know, you know, as far advanced as we can.
**Samanthaleigh840**: I think it's gonna be easier on everybody.
**Samanthaleigh840**: You know, one thing I was, I was thinking about, you know, is like you see all these like, you know, you go on social media, you see the, you know, you can get videos from Bazarian Sartain clubs.
**Samanthaleigh840**: You can, you can steal stuff anywhere.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Like, what if like you like, you know, take a bunch of footage from different, you know, high end parties, you know, take it, clip it up and make it a new video being like, oh hey, like, you know, our last party in Vegas was off the hook, blah blah, blah, and like do some kind of fake promo like that.
**Luke**: Yep, 100%.
**Luke**: Yeah, we can definitely look at, look at that.
**Luke**: The girls doing the promo with like one of the things that they want to do just so you know, is they want to do a pre party to get all the content of the hot girls and modeling agencies to then promote for your party, which is a fucking genius idea.
**Luke**: Just so you know, really, really smart.
**Luke**: It's like, yeah, hottest girls.
**Luke**: The hottest girls want to be around where the hottest girls are and then from there, bang, 100% can do that, can take other parties and everything like that.
**Luke**: For sure.
**Luke**: Definitely.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Yes.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Yeah, that, that's smart.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Yeah.
**Samanthaleigh840**: And then just then Luke and I get some, you know, be there, get some good content.
**Luke**: Whatnot.
**Luke**: 100.
**Luke**: The only other things other than, than that, the only thing that will be considered you is that I've been working with Maria to get transportation of you from the pre party to the, to the actual party as well.
**Luke**: So you've let Maria know if you want a sprinter van, if you want a Rolls Royce or whatever they offer in the luxury of kind of, of things.
**Luke**: But yeah, we can, you can go with a bike.
**Eileeniglesias2**: What do you mean?
**Eileeniglesias2**: Start biking.
**Luke**: Bicycle?
**Luke**: Yeah.
**Luke**: Don't tell me one of those guys.
**Luke**: It doesn't matter right away.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Yeah, I just roll up like a bum.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Like.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Yeah, just.
**Luke**: You and rollerblades.
**Luke**: I could see working that.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Would I gotta ask for rollerblades?
**Luke**: Yeah, that's what we got on.
**Luke**: Okay.
**Luke**: Marie, if we could book that thing in the next couple of days for everyone.
**Luke**: Just no brainer in the back end.
**Luke**: Me and Maria really working.
**Luke**: Like, I'm like, you know me, it's like, I'll get it done right.
**Luke**: You know me, I'll get it done.
**Luke**: So it's just like, I'm doing all the shit that we don't want to leave the last minute, if that makes sense.
**Luke**: Yep, yep, we're good.
**Luke**: Other than that, there's no other big decisions.
**Luke**: I just want to touch base for you and be like, you know, if we can keep, keep, like, you know, just, you know, very, very civil.
**Luke**: I know you're going for a bunch of shit, so I'm very understanding.
**Luke**: As a business, I'm understanding of your situation for sure.
**Luke**: But.
**Luke**: And then with the other stuff, the other party, I think that's a bad representation.
**Luke**: I think, you know, we've learned.
**Luke**: I learned, I learned a lot of what they did as well, in the American sort of style.
**Luke**: So, yeah, we can, we can, we can really, really think your thing is that, like, my only other question is the open bar.
**Luke**: It's just what, what kind of.
**Luke**: What do you want in alcohol wise?
**Luke**: Just so I know, because in Australia, I have our alcohol.
**Luke**: We have about 300 tax on it.
**Luke**: It's fucking enormous.
**Luke**: Right?
**Luke**: So I, I put massive amounts of budget to it, but apparently it's not.
**Luke**: So just one.
**Luke**: It's.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Yeah.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Here, it's like, I mean, you, you know, you buy it.
**Samanthaleigh840**: If I buy a bottle of Booze, it's a 7% tax like it is on anything else.
**Luke**: Yeah.
**Luke**: Okay, well, yeah, standard sales tax.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Yeah.
**Samanthaleigh840**: So you can.
**Luke**: Crazy.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Yeah, So I mean, you gotta think.
**Samanthaleigh840**: I mean, you could, you could buy.
**Samanthaleigh840**: I mean, for 100 people, you could buy.
**Luke**: I mean, if you went to the.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Liquor store and you bought just a bunch of bottles and mixers and stuff, like, you could buy a full couple bars, you know, to feed.
**Samanthaleigh840**: I would say 1500 bucks.
**Luke**: Okay, cool.
**Samanthaleigh840**: 2000 maybe.
**Samanthaleigh840**: You know, I mean, like.
**Luke**: Because I put five grand because I'm like, in Australia, a bar tab, like an open bar for a wedding, is 15 grand.
**Luke**: That's how much it is.
**Samanthaleigh840**: No, it's like, it's like for a wedding here, it's like three.
**Luke**: Crazy.
**Luke**: Yeah, that's how my.
**Luke**: That's.
**Luke**: Australia's fucked.
**Luke**: Our liquor stuff sucks.
**Luke**: Okay, that's good.
**Samanthaleigh840**: That's crazy because you guys drink like fish.
**Luke**: Yeah, no, exactly.
**Luke**: And what do you want?
**Luke**: Do you want beers?
**Luke**: You want wine?
**Luke**: Do you want tequila?
**Samanthaleigh840**: So, I mean, I I would think, like, again, like, and again, I would defer, you know, to the ladies on what they want.
**Samanthaleigh840**: But I mean, my thought would be like, you know, it, you know, obviously, like a full liquor bar, and then you probably have, you know, beer, wine, champagne.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Like the, the.
**Samanthaleigh840**: A bigger reason why, like, you know, I like the, the idea of, like, having, you know, open bars.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Hey, you know, you know, people don't have to pay.
**Samanthaleigh840**: It's just easy.
**Samanthaleigh840**: And two, like, one thing that I've always loved is all the big parties that I go to.
**Luke**: Yeah.
**Samanthaleigh840**: When I walk in, there's always servers there with.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Walking around with like a beer and champagne or, you know, whatever it is.
**Samanthaleigh840**: And then you can just, you know, grab it, walk around.
**Samanthaleigh840**: It's just such a great entrance versus normally people walk into a, you know, party like any of the other, like, you know, table parties I've been to, and it's like, oh, I gotta go wait in line at the bar.
**Samanthaleigh840**: But if it's already there, people immediately mingle.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Check it out.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Like, it's so.
**Samanthaleigh840**: It's so much more relaxing.
**Luke**: Okay, good.
**Luke**: This is good information, for sure.
**Luke**: 100%.
**Luke**: Can definitely look at, look at, look at that.
**Luke**: No problem.
**Samanthaleigh840**: You know, it can even be like a, you know, it doesn't have to be a servant, per se.
**Samanthaleigh840**: It could be a champagne wall.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Like, there's different things to do, but yeah, people can walk in and just immediately get served because everybody on the list is going to be over 21.
**Luke**: Yeah, 100%.
**Luke**: Yeah, it's.
**Luke**: It's an easy, easy kind of thing.
**Luke**: Okay, cool.
**Luke**: Yeah, no stress on that.
**Luke**: We'll look at it.
**Luke**: I'm really working the budget, and then we'll work on the miscellaneous stuff as well.
**Luke**: I think the ice sculpture is great.
**Luke**: I think that's a necessity with a lot of these parties, especially in the heat.
**Luke**: It's kind of fun.
**Samanthaleigh840**: I thought the saxophone thing was really cool.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Yeah.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Eileen's idea about the Uber credit for the girls and they get it at the party was excellent.
**Luke**: Yeah, the Uber credit is like, so basically we were talking to Maria.
**Luke**: I think we've all chose the wrong profession because, like, a magician was like two and a half K for two hours.
**Luke**: A saxophone, this was like two and a half K as well.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah, that was too much.
**Eileeniglesias2**: I'm like, what, Brandon?
**Luke**: Why didn't you learn to play the saxophone?
**Luke**: Come on, man.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Golly, I can't complain.
**Samanthaleigh840**: It's gonna save my life.
**Luke**: A magician.
**Luke**: Two and a half grand or three and a half grand wasn't It.
**Luke**: Were you talking wild?
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah, it was three.
**Eileeniglesias2**: It was the.
**Eileeniglesias2**: The.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah, it was one.
**Eileeniglesias2**: It was 3,500, and the other one was 3,000.
**Eileeniglesias2**: It was just too much for just three, two hours.
**Samanthaleigh840**: I was like, yeah, that's nice.
**Luke**: Yeah.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah.
**Luke**: So just get.
**Samanthaleigh840**: There's better entertainment out there.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Yeah, yeah.
**Luke**: I'm going to be looking at, like, what we can get for the cheapest thing that.
**Luke**: Just entertainment.
**Luke**: And what I'm thinking.
**Luke**: And this is kind of.
**Luke**: I wanted to.
**Luke**: It's like the party goes on from 7 till 11, right.
**Luke**: That's the time window we have.
**Luke**: And I'm thinking if we can do.
**Luke**: A lot of.
**Luke**: This is like every hour there's a new act that's kind of cool where it's like.
**Luke**: Instead of getting them for two hours, three hours, it's like, oh, we want you for 30 minutes, 45 minutes, an hour or something.
**Luke**: And then four different.
**Samanthaleigh840**: I thought we were gonna do eight.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Eight to midnight because seven's too early.
**Luke**: So that was in the previous event, this one.
**Luke**: It only goes to 11.
**Luke**: The red room.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Oh, it's only.
**Samanthaleigh840**: It's only open to 11.
**Luke**: Only to 11, yep.
**Luke**: And so that was that.
**Luke**: But it's close enough to the other areas that we can organize in the background.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Did they say.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Did they say why.
**Luke**: You would have to refer to Eileen and Samantha about that?
**Luke**: I wouldn't know.
**Samanthaleigh840**: I might give that guy a call and work my magic and.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Because, I mean, he may say that, but I often say.
**Samanthaleigh840**: No, No, I don't think you heard me.
**Samanthaleigh840**: What's it take to be open to midnight?
**Luke**: Sure.
**Luke**: 100%.
**Luke**: Yeah.
**Luke**: No, that.
**Luke**: That could be a cool.
**Luke**: That could be a cool.
**Luke**: What's it take?
**Luke**: I like that.
**Luke**: He.
**Luke**: He's a. I don't know if you've dealt with him, but he owns a construction business as well.
**Luke**: Like a steel kind of thing.
**Luke**: You probably may have heard of him.
**Luke**: I don't know.
**Luke**: That's good.
**Samanthaleigh840**: But then, yeah, then that.
**Samanthaleigh840**: I can.
**Samanthaleigh840**: I can leverage that and be like.
**Luke**: Hey, man, I have a look at his name.
**Luke**: I think it's Dominic something.
**Luke**: Maria.
**Luke**: I don't know if you have him, but yeah, he owns real steel something.
**Luke**: He's a sculpture, a sculptor of steel.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Oh, it's architectural steel.
**Luke**: Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's the one.
**Luke**: Yeah.
**Luke**: So at least you'd be able to vibe about that or something like that.
**Luke**: Cool.
**Luke**: Any other thing, like, I'm sure we can't get the Penguins, man.
**Luke**: I'm trying to.
**Samanthaleigh840**: That would have been so tight.
**Luke**: That would be Fucking fun as.
**Luke**: But they're only mini penguins.
**Luke**: Did I.
**Luke**: Did you get the information?
**Luke**: The mini.
**Luke**: They're only mini penguins and, like, six out of the nine died.
**Luke**: Yeah, bro.
**Luke**: Yeah.
**Luke**: I was like, fucking.
**Luke**: All right.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Yeah.
**Luke**: So.
**Luke**: So I'll be thinking on the missile.
**Luke**: Everything's good.
**Luke**: It just.
**Luke**: It's like as much budget as I can put to the girls or getting girls in there.
**Luke**: That's what I want to put towards.
**Luke**: And then the other shit we can work out.
**Luke**: You know what I mean?
**Samanthaleigh840**: Yeah.
**Luke**: For you.
**Luke**: I know the only thing that you give about open bar and girls, that's it.
**Luke**: Yeah.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Yeah.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Have a good time and it all works out.
**Samanthaleigh840**: And, like, again, worst case scenario, if it's like, hey, man, we need an extra two grand to do xyz.
**Luke**: Like, it's not like, yeah, okay, I'll keep it there.
**Luke**: If there's nothing that I can work around, I'll definitely come to you with the budget.
**Luke**: Budget questions.
**Luke**: But it should be there.
**Luke**: You can see it live when me.
**Luke**: Where I'm tinkering with it and working with Maria every day on getting it down and just like, you know, just working with it as much as possible.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Yeah, perfect.
**Luke**: Anything, Brandon, Anything that.
**Samanthaleigh840**: No, I don't think so.
**Samanthaleigh840**: We'll.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Yeah, we need to get.
**Samanthaleigh840**: I mean, the venue should have its own insurance, so we shouldn't have to insure.
**Luke**: Yeah, no, that shouldn't be a problem.
**Samanthaleigh840**: We need to.
**Samanthaleigh840**: We need to set Maria, we need to go ahead and if you can, we need to say.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Tell me about the entity.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Yeah, we need to do an entity with Luke and I as.
**Samanthaleigh840**: As 50.
**Samanthaleigh840**: 50.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Just to shield us in case something happens, you know, because I can't.
**Samanthaleigh840**: If I put.
**Samanthaleigh840**: If I put my name on it, then, you know, people will try to sue us.
**Samanthaleigh840**: So.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Yeah, so just, you know, you can put it, like, as, you know, B L events or whatever.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Yeah, I will start with that.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Okay.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Yeah.
**Samanthaleigh840**: And that way.
**Samanthaleigh840**: That way we'll just, you know, we'll run everything through there.
**Samanthaleigh840**: You know, we're safe.
**Luke**: Why don't you just come up with a completely different name?
**Luke**: No.
**Luke**: No letters or anything.
**Luke**: Just like a weird name.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Yeah, it doesn't matter.
**Samanthaleigh840**: I mean, whatever.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Like, it's just whatever.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Like, it could be, I don't know, something.
**Samanthaleigh840**: I don't know.
**Samanthaleigh840**: It can.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Z Top.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Whatever.
**Luke**: Zita.
**Samanthaleigh840**: ZZ Top.
**Samanthaleigh840**: ZZ Top.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Penguin Events.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Doesn't matter.
**Luke**: King Penguin Events.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Yeah, I like it.
**Samanthaleigh840**: There it is.
**Luke**: Yep.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Penguin Events.
**Luke**: That's hilarious.
**Luke**: Black and White events.
**Luke**: Yeah.
**Luke**: Good, good, good, good idea, Brandon.
**Luke**: That's genius as well.
**Luke**: Very, very good.
**Luke**: Yeah.
**Luke**: I think if you have the event space as soon as they leave the space.
**Luke**: Now I got to talk to the girls because it's seven grand for the.
**Luke**: For the place, but there was also a five grand pac to know what the difference in that two grand is and what are we paying for, you know, so I'm going to work that and.
**Luke**: And then everything else.
**Luke**: I'll run it by you before it needs to get paid and then we'll just get it, get it sorted perfect as well.
**Luke**: I don't think there's anything else.
**Luke**: Is there anything that you wanted to discuss other than that?
**Luke**: And by the way, just refer to a lot to me.
**Luke**: Just like ask Sam.
**Luke**: Ask them.
**Luke**: I'll.
**Luke**: Sam.
**Luke**: Because I'll be able to do everything I've got.
**Luke**: Everything.
**Luke**: Because you know, you know, running, running all this other.
**Luke**: Other.
**Luke**: I'm just going to be as scheduled as possible.
**Samanthaleigh840**: That's fine.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Maria, do we have an agenda for Rottweiler.
**Eileeniglesias2**: For this?
**Eileeniglesias2**: No, we don't.
**Samanthaleigh840**: No, for Rottweiler for the meeting in three minutes.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Oh, sorry.
**Eileeniglesias2**: No, we don't.
**Eileeniglesias2**: No, they just want to jump and talk with you.
**Samanthaleigh840**: God damn it.
**Eileeniglesias2**: And then wait.
**Eileeniglesias2**: We need to wait.
**Eileeniglesias2**: But some had had a good idea the last meeting he mentioned.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Remember when you did the.
**Eileeniglesias2**: A little drink.
**Eileeniglesias2**: You kind of want like a drink for you and l cook like a Brandon drink or something sponsored for you guys on that day.
**Samanthaleigh840**: I don't know.
**Samanthaleigh840**: I mean, I don't know if I.
**Samanthaleigh840**: Having a drink named after me.
**Samanthaleigh840**: It might be a little lame, but it's.
**Samanthaleigh840**: We can, I don't know, you guys can bounce the idea now.
**Eileeniglesias2**: We'll try to see if that's a good fit or not.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Okay.
**Luke**: Okay.
**Luke**: I'll send tomorrow's meeting schedule, what we want to talk about in the group, and then we can discuss that Brandon, when you've got some time as well in.
**Luke**: In tomorrow's call or the day after tomorrow.
**Luke**: Thanks, guys.
**Luke**: Appreciate it.
**Eileeniglesias2**: Bye, guys.
