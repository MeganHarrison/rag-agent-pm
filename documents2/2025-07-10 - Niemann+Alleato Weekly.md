## Transcript
**Sclevenger**: There it is.
**Cmortensen**: Hey, Glendon.
**Bclymer**: Hello.
**Ahuettl**: Sorry I'm late.
**Cmortensen**: You're good, man.
**Cmortensen**: I wish I had more to update you on, except for I just share my screen with you here real quick.
**Cmortensen**: So here's kind of what I'm dealing with.
**Cmortensen**: I don't know if you saw.
**Cmortensen**: Did you see the email?
**Cmortensen**: I don't know if you're on that thread yet.
**Cmortensen**: And I'm sorry, you haven't been added.
**Cmortensen**: I'll make sure I add you to this thread.
**Cmortensen**: Glendon.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: So sorry.
**Bclymer**: So sorry.
**Bclymer**: Aj.
**Cmortensen**: You're good, Sean.
**Cmortensen**: I don't have much to update.
**Cmortensen**: I wish I did, but, you know, I'm just keeping FedEx in the loop.
**Cmortensen**: I called with knee sync too.
**Cmortensen**: One of them had called me yesterday and I'm.
**Cmortensen**: Or two days ago.
**Cmortensen**: And I just.
**Cmortensen**: I was like, guys, I.
**Cmortensen**: The only thing I can share with you is right now our a.
**Cmortensen**: This is my portal in Carmel.
**Cmortensen**: We're still in review and it's getting to be a bit ridiculous.
**Cmortensen**: So if I don't hear anything, I'm going to just run by the city and I'm gonna kill him with kindness.
**Sclevenger**: But.
**Cmortensen**: Obviously you don't ever want to piss the city off, right?
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Cmortensen**: But I am gonna be like.
**Cmortensen**: I mean, if you look at my reports here, like my status, the time with my jurisdiction has been 42 days and two hours.
**Cmortensen**: And the time with me would have been eight.
**Cmortensen**: So that's when I start.
**Cmortensen**: I send in the application, right?
**Cmortensen**: Compile everything, send them the drawings.
**Cmortensen**: And then it took them like 35 days to respond with their final review comments.
**Cmortensen**: And then I sent this in last week.
**Cmortensen**: If you look at tasks here.
**Cmortensen**: Oh, I don't know how to.
**Sclevenger**: Okay, reviews.
**Cmortensen**: So I responded to all of these, you know, over a week ago now.
**Cmortensen**: They had 23 comments.
**Sclevenger**: So.
**Cmortensen**: Other than that, the only one I've gotten was.
**Cmortensen**: Was yesterday at 4:20.
**Cmortensen**: But they don't let me respond to it until all the comments have been completed with all the reviewers.
**Cmortensen**: So I'm expecting if they responded yesterday at 4:20 to one of them, I'll be able to type a response to him back hopefully tomorrow.
**Cmortensen**: But I did bump FedEx again too, and ask them about their updated signage package.
**Cmortensen**: So we.
**Cmortensen**: We have that kind of in our favor with, hey man, we need like two.
**Cmortensen**: Two more weeks to get this project done.
**Cmortensen**: Because we also waited two weeks for you guys to get me an updated signage.
**Cmortensen**: Signage package.
**Bclymer**: So what is their response when you.
**Bclymer**: When you mention that to FedEx?
**Bclymer**: What is FedEx's response?
**Cmortensen**: I don't have anything in writing.
**Cmortensen**: I just have me telling them in.
**Cmortensen**: In a meeting.
**Cmortensen**: And that's why we take our meeting notes.
**Cmortensen**: So if they ever give us pushback, it is.
**Cmortensen**: We do have it on record in a transcript of me telling them, hey, guys, we're losing some time here.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Sclevenger**: So.
**Cmortensen**: All right, we're gonna do.
**Cmortensen**: We have all the material ordered and bought.
**Cmortensen**: We have the RTU sitting and waiting.
**Cmortensen**: I just need the.
**Cmortensen**: Okay.
**Cmortensen**: And then we'll rip and roar on it.
**Cmortensen**: All right.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Sounds great.
**Cmortensen**: You know, I expect a couple weeks to build the wall, but we're going to coordinate it where everybody's.
**Cmortensen**: Alex is good at what he does.
**Cmortensen**: That's why I have him on the job.
**Cmortensen**: He's gonna.
**Cmortensen**: We're gonna be working shoulder to shoulder, but probably stepping on each other's toes, but we're gonna get it done.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: I appreciate that.
**Cmortensen**: That's all.
**Cmortensen**: That's all I can tell you.
**Cmortensen**: I hope you guys are doing all right.
**Cmortensen**: I know anytime someone leaves the team, it's tough to start catching up and making up for things, so.
**Bclymer**: Glendon's doing a great job about that.
**Ahuettl**: But I'm doing my best.
**Bclymer**: We got about 10 people here.
**Bclymer**: That's all taken on a little bit, so it's working well.
**Bclymer**: But thank you.
**Sclevenger**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Ahuettl**: You've got a new baby, A.J.
**Cmortensen**: I do?
**Bclymer**: Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes.
**Bclymer**: Did you say it was a little boy?
**Cmortensen**: Got a little.
**Cmortensen**: Little baby boy.
**Cmortensen**: He was born.
**Cmortensen**: When was he born?
**Cmortensen**: He's born on sick.
**Cmortensen**: It would have been 6, 28.
**Ahuettl**: Yeah.
**Cmortensen**: So, yeah, almost two weeks ago.
**Cmortensen**: But yeah, I. I got to work from home last week and take some time off, which was nice.
**Sclevenger**: And.
**Cmortensen**: And we're just battling the no sleep, but all is good.
**Cmortensen**: Besides, that is my first.
**Cmortensen**: Yeah, it's an absolute joy we took him home.
**Cmortensen**: It's wild because, like, she had some.
**Cmortensen**: She's having some complications with blood pressure, and so she hasn't been able to drive.
**Cmortensen**: But anyway, they held her a little longer.
**Cmortensen**: My wife.
**Cmortensen**: Than expected.
**Cmortensen**: So we were at the hospital.
**Cmortensen**: We went in for the induction Friday morning at 3am and we didn't leave until Monday night.
**Bclymer**: Oh.
**Cmortensen**: And I have, like.
**Cmortensen**: I'm always on the go, and so I was getting stirred crazy.
**Cmortensen**: It wasn't about me, but still I was, like, ready to get the heck out of that hospital.
**Ahuettl**: When I was.
**Ahuettl**: When we had.
**Ahuettl**: When we had my son and we were in the hospital, I felt like it was a prison.
**Ahuettl**: I was so.
**Ahuettl**: I was so ready and, like, I couldn't Like, I could go walk around the hospital myself, and I guess I could leave or whatever, but I was trying to help with our son, and, like, I tried to take him out and walk around a little.
**Ahuettl**: They're like, no, you know, you can't leave the room with him unless he's in, like, this little rolling bassinet thing.
**Ahuettl**: And I was like, okay.
**Ahuettl**: So, yeah, I was pumped to get home for sure.
**Cmortensen**: Prison.
**Cmortensen**: And then.
**Cmortensen**: And then all of a sudden, they just come in and they're like, all right, you're good to go.
**Cmortensen**: And they just, like.
**Cmortensen**: You drop off at the curb.
**Cmortensen**: And I'm like, yep, picking them up.
**Cmortensen**: Put him in the car seat.
**Cmortensen**: And I was driving, like, 20 miles per hour.
**Cmortensen**: Yeah, I was like, not today.
**Cmortensen**: And I drive a big truck, so.
