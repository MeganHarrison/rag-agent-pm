## Short Summary
Recent construction progress faced significant challenges due to city inspections and staffing issues. A temporary use permit is needed for material storage, with a violation noted regarding dumpster placement at the Pizza Hut lot. Staffing shortages led to zero laborers available on site, further exacerbated by a 1.5-hour delay in replacement laborers from PeopleReady. Immediate relocation of construction materials from the Pizza Hut lot is essential to avoid further permit violations, especially critical items which must be moved to fenced areas. Full fencing around the ADA ramp is now required instead of cones, and the loading dock fencing needs an extension of 20-30 feet for compliance. Joy Brown has been appointed as the primary city contact for inspections, and a documentation strategy for before/after photos has been established. The city has requested better visibility for designated handicap parking, proposing a Google Earth snapshot to validate existing spaces. Critical inspections from the building department and fire marshal are scheduled for 1:00 PM, necessitating prompt resolution of all compliance issues. A Temporary Certificate of Occupancy (TCO) is targeted for today, contingent on addressing all issues within two hours. Construction cleaning is also scheduled for Friday the 5th, with operational areas needing urgent attention to meet deadlines.

## Transcript

**Jesse Remillard:**
Sa. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Hello? 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Hey, Jack. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Hey. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Hey, Jack. Andrew's just finding the invite in his email. Andrew, Goodwill. So, Jack, walk us through what happened this morning, please. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yeah. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
I can hear now. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
So the city. 

**Jack Curtin:**
The two girls from the city planning department were upset to see material sitting in the Pizza Hut parking lot. They said that we were supposed to file for what's called a hold up on my notes, a construction support temporary use permit. And since that. That was out there, that disqualifies us for one of the three things that they were looking for. And the. The dumpster was over there as well. So that was their. Their big complaint on that. Never. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
What did they say? Did they do any inside inspection? 

**Jack Curtin:**
The inside. They didn't have. They have much to complain about. Just to make sure that we fence in the. The doctor area. Of course. Yeah, they don't. 

**Andrew Cannon:**
The two that showed up, they. They weren't responsible for any of the interior checks. They were just the exterior. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Okay. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Did we. What. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Did you get the fence up yet as Josh on site? 

**Jack Curtin:**
No, Josh called out sick. And then I had another two laborers on top of that that never showed up. So we had no laborers show up today. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Okay. Please prioritize that fence because we need that for the inspector that's coming that does inspect the inside. 

**Andrew Cannon:**
I'm on my way to get. I got my impact. I just don't have a socket to loosen the bolt. So I'm getting that as we speak. That's going to get moved in. Everything is marked up in a drawing that we're going to get accomplished based off their notes. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Service just won't get you any other help there. They don't have any help. 

**Jack Curtin:**
They had another. So one of them called out and then the other two, she said she will send me. And I said, so they can come now? And she said, yes, but that was an hour and a half ago and I still haven't seen them. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Have you talked to her again? 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yes, and she said they're supposedly on their way. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Back to the parking lot. Permit. Are you going to pull a permit so we can have the stuff there? Are you going to get it all out of there and have them come back today so that they don't fail us? 

**Jack Curtin:**
The mason has a one ton sitting in the pizza parking lot. Getting everything out of that parking lot as we speak. 

**Andrew Cannon:**
Be calling to get that dumpster moved. And then Jack and I are talking about getting a smaller one because the only other spot is going to be able to fit without having to get that permit is going to be that Side parking lot where the canopy is putting it in a corner somewhere with on old asphalt. Like just Jesse R. Remillard me. Or my only other thought is if it's not going to work there, get some sort of dunnage or something for small dumpsters on top of. So we're not hurting that parking lot and it's out of the way of the canopy too. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
I know, but I guess what is the plan to get the TCO today? Like maybe I'm just not hearing it but is the dumpster going to be gone in an hour and the materials are all gone in an hour and these guys will come back or. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
The. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Big kickers them coming back? I mean they didn't sound too open to work with us. They just said, you know, be in touch and we'll see what we can do about rescheduling you. But originally they, they did slightly accidentally like slip up and say about an opening later this evening. But they wouldn't give me a direct sale for them to contact him. But I have both Joy and Jennifer's email. So I did email them back, you know, saying, you know, we're, we're looking good to resolve all this today. Would it be a potential to have you swing back by later this evening around 3:34 at that other opening that, that they mentioned? If not could possibly we send pictures of those items showing that they're resolved. And then another thing they didn't like. So this what I brought up last week, they didn't. The material that's left around the ADA ramp, they don't want it coned and flagged off. If we leave any stuff over there as a lay down area, they want that fenced in too. So we were going to fence in that as well and send them pictures of everything. 

**Andrew Cannon:**
I'll do my best. Try to find a number of some sort of contact, try to get them back out here or an answer. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yeah, we got the main contact is Joy Brown and she gave us her, her car. But it's only her direct line and then the main office line. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Did you try your direct line? 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yeah, no answer. And I, I sent her and her assistant Jennifer an email. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Yeah, you're gonna have to kill them with kindness to try to get them back today. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yeah, totally, totally. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Do you have before and after pictures of all this stuff? Like you can take a picture now. They're cleaning it up. Take a picture when it's done. It's all cleaned up at the Pizza. 

**Andrew Cannon:**
Hut right now if you want to go around and get a picture. Yeah, two minutes ago. 

**Jack Curtin:**
I'll go get before pictures right now. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
I mean, Jesse, I don't know what you think, but like if we can show them, here's what they found. As soon as we knew about it, we got rid of it. Email it to them. Maybe they can, they obviously have the inspector's numbers. They can just talk to them and get them to sign off on it without having to come back out possibly. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Oh, absolutely. Emailing and follow up pictures, stuff completed is huge. 

**Jack Curtin:**
You know, of course, I mean I killed him with kindness. When they complained about us stuff being over here, I just apologized. I said I've even talked to the owner of that lot and he didn't ever mention it, so I wasn't aware. And she said yes. And fortunately some owners of properties in, in Bloomington don't even know. So once I told her that I even talked to the owner about putting stuff over there. I think she thought at first that we just were just ignorantly putting stuff over there without even talking to any property owner or anything over there. Because at first she was pretty frustrated to see that stuff over there. But I just got some before pictures of the front. I'm walking to the ADA ramp. Another thing is they, they wanted to see, they wanted to see a designated handicap parking spot. But on the site plan, I don't, I don't have any designated spots on the east parking lot. Andrew talked about them. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Go ahead, Jack. Oh no, you go ahead, keep going. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Andrew talked about them basically gaining some more parking up front, but he wasn't 100% sure on that yet. And then if, if there was to be parking up front that maybe some handicap parking would be up there. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Like as part of their lease, they get, they get the existing parking lot in the front that's got handicapped parking spots. I don't understand what, what are they wanting from us? There is no handicap like backed by the donation vestibule because that's not parking for anybody other than employees that work there. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yeah. So then if that's the case, then we'll have to get them because on the site plan it doesn't show that parking up front. It just shows us. It just shows the parking lot over on the east side. So they want it like a map showing about the parking up front. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Well, Jesse, I don't know if you want to take care of that or I can. So these guys can keep knocking out everything on site. But that's just a Google Earth. We can take a snapshot of that and show them where the handicap parking is. If that's what they want. I don't get it, because that's dumb. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yeah. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
I'm trying to find the drawing. 

**Andrew Cannon:**
I want to say even that back area where they're. By the steel ramp we put in that they were even saying technically there should be a permit for all that material and work right there. Having all that sitting in the back lot. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
That's their own. 

**Andrew Cannon:**
I told you, J.R. and ASOS. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
That's. 

**Andrew Cannon:**
And that's what Junior brought up to me. So I. I don't know what that's. I just. We didn't know the moment. I didn't know the moment. So let's just put that out there. 

**Jack Curtin:**
I. I thought we were okay back here, but they just. We originally talked about a cone with caution tape of this area, but they said that it. Everything back here definitely has to be fenced in. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
But I don't. 

**Jack Curtin:**
I can't. I don't. I don't recall her saying that this area had to be part of the permit, but definitely the Pizza Hut parking lot. If we, if we were to keep material over there. 

**Andrew Cannon:**
My other question is, do we have enough fence to take inside then? Does any construction fence have to stay in that parking lot? 

**Jack Curtin:**
No, it's. We shouldn't need any more in that parking lot. If I were to. If we were to still leave some material out there. But everything has to be gone out of that parking lot. 

**Andrew Cannon:**
And all the subs know that. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yeah. Yeah. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Sweet. Yeah. 

**Andrew Cannon:**
And all material, it seems, so I want to make sure I got it right. So the back area, the only thing that needs to be fenced off is the. Is a good portion of that loading dock area. The rest will be open to Goodwill. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yeah. 

**Andrew Cannon:**
Okay. So any construction material in that. Outside of that fencing would have to be gone as well. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yes. Yeah. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Yeah. Which. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Glenn Marks. Glenn Marks truck is here right now loading up their extra stuff that was inside. And electricians got their stuff picked up. What's left, they're going to put in our fenced in, lay down area that we have inside. We're going to run the fence like I said earlier, another 20, 30ft to the right of the loading dock where the. Where the new wall meets the old existing wall. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
And you got the signs of the dust mop ready to go? 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yeah, I got. I picked up five extra signs from Lowe's this morning of do not enter and two dust mops, which the lady, Stephanie from PeopleReady, she just texted me eight minutes ago saying they're five minutes away, talking about the two laborers. So as soon as they get here, they'll still start on the. Another thing that they. That they didn't like. You remember all that floor angle, Jesse that we had Jock and that other laborer put right there in the grass? 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Yeah, yeah. 

**Jack Curtin:**
She. She wants all that relocated too. So that's going to either go in the fenced in area back by the ADA ramp, or if I got enough room to put it up against the wall in the inside fenced in area, it's going to go in one of those areas. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Okay. Yeah. That's an odd one to complain about, but yeah. We'll just get it relocated to somewhere that it's going to work and then take pictures. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yeah. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
And I'll send you this handicap parking stuff. 

**Andrew Cannon:**
I got the sockets. We'll be back in 10 minutes and we'll knock this out. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Okay. 

**Andrew Cannon:**
I'll call the. I can. I. I should have the number for the dumpster service. Unless Jack, you want to call them when we get off, then I'll. We also got to call the inspector again. Try to get them out so they can see that and make sure pictures are good. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Just make sure you have everything set up before you get them back because we don't want them back. And then. 

**Andrew Cannon:**
Absolutely. That'll take forever for them to ever come back. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yeah. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
And just get those, those two labors going on moving that stuff right away, please. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Definitely. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
And then any fence. 

**Andrew Cannon:**
And they're. We hired them just to help with what the fence and any, any material that needs to be moved. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Everything we want them to help with. Okay. And if we have issues getting the dumpster people, we can probably move that dumpster with the, the Skytrack. 

**Andrew Cannon:**
Are we responsible for any cleaning. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Of. I guess. 

**Andrew Cannon:**
Does any. Does it need to be like ready, like operational clean? I don't know if. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Yeah, yeah, that's. We want that thing looking ready to move into as much as we can. Yeah, I mean it's in pretty good shape on Friday on the inside or Thursday. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yeah, yeah. 

**Andrew Cannon:**
All the bathrooms and offices will be used and all that. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Yeah, we need to make sure those are clean. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Originally when I talked to Andrew, he mentioned about coming in like when they. When they use the dock door area on either the 8th or the 9th for it to be cleaned before then. So I have. Right now I have the construction clean scheduled for Friday the 5th. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Okay. Yeah. We just need to make sure those bathrooms and everything in the TCO area, everything's good. 

**Andrew Cannon:**
To think if there's anything. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
All right. Do you guys get anything else? So you know. Know what we need to do. 

**Andrew Cannon:**
I think that's it. Not that drawing that I marked up. It's in. It's not saved in a specific folder. I mean, it's in the drawings folder of the Bloomington job. It's just today's date Andrew Cannon markup. So you can see it there. That's what we're all. It's got the fences and everything, so. So we'll knock all that out. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Okay. I sit in there. 

**Andrew Cannon:**
Sweet. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Yeah, it's downloading. Okay. 

**Andrew Cannon:**
We all clear on everything? 

**Jesse Remillard:**
All right, I'll be. Yeah, if you guys are good. And then I'll be checking in with you shortly in between the next meetings I have. 

**Andrew Cannon:**
Perfect. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
So just do you. All good? 

**Jesse Dawson:**
Yeah, sorry, I was. Talked to Canon for a second there, but, like, by noon are we gonna have an update on, like. We got everything ready to go for the Whoever. So there are some people coming in at one. 

**Jack Curtin:**
Yeah, the building department and the fire marshal. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
Yeah, that's going to be a big one. Sorry. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
I'm just saying, like, everything if it's addressed from this morning's comments when these labors show up, you just getting everything addressed that they might have had as comments. Maybe these guys don't go outside. Maybe that's good too, because you don't want them finding something else out there, but. Gotcha. 

**Jesse Remillard:**
All right, guys. All right. I can help with anything, and I'll check in with you shortly. 

**Andrew Cannon:**
Sounds good. 

**Jesse Remillard:**

**Jesse Dawson:**
So, hey, was the drawing to show them the handicapped parking space, was that something you're gonna do, Jesse, or you want me to knock it out? 

**Jesse Remillard:**
I'm doing it right now. 

**Jesse Dawson:**

**Jesse Remillard:**
Yeah. 

**Jesse Dawson:**
