## Transcript
**Jcurtin**: The morning, but I had to go to the bed, and I bring my cat to that in the morning, so I just went for a few hours in the afternoon.
**Jdawson**: Is your cat doing all right?
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, he.
**Jcurtin**: He's always got issues.
**Jcurtin**: So he's older.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And I know the feeling, man.
**Jdawson**: It seems like my dog goes to the vet constantly.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, yeah, he's.
**Jcurtin**: He's there all the time.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: How old is your dog?
**Jdawson**: She's eight.
**Jcurtin**: Eight?
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, she still acts like a puppy, but.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, she gets, like, weird infections and shit from whatever she gets into.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, there's lots of weird stuff in Arizona, like parasites and stuff.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: You guys have.
**Jcurtin**: You have, like, tarantulas there.
**Jdawson**: Oh, yeah, tarantulas, black widows, scorpions, rattlesnakes.
**Jcurtin**: Really?
**Jcurtin**: Scorpions?
**Jcurtin**: Wow.
**Jdawson**: Oh, yeah.
**Jdawson**: They're everywhere down here.
**Jcurtin**: Never seen one.
**Jdawson**: No, I'd rather not see those.
**Jcurtin**: You say you do see them sometimes.
**Jdawson**: Not where I live right now, but my old house down by that Siva project is on the far southwest edge of town.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And that's where you see, like, rattlesnakes and scorpions and all that fun stuff.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: No, thanks.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, well, today I'm working.
**Jcurtin**: I'm getting some rfiso, and then.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: I talked to the awning company this morning, and hopefully I can get pricing today.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, I definitely need to get those ordered.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we also definitely want to find out the lead times and install times and all that stuff.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, they're about five to six weeks out once we approve the order.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: So that'll be the last thing we do on this project, I'm pretty sure.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And how are we coming along with that civil stuff for the part?
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, we got updated drawings, so that should be all sorted out now.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: And the windows, they should have those cut down and install by the.
**Jcurtin**: By the end of this week.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And then Jack emailed me on Saturday and asked if I was working yesterday.
**Jdawson**: So I'm assuming he wants to go over something schedule, and he texted me this morning and said we could catch up on it at the meeting.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, Yeah, I think we set up a meeting on Friday to go over it, but then I think he got too busy, so we weren't.
**Jcurtin**: Weren't able to.
**Jcurtin**: But yeah, we'll see what we can do today or tomorrow.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we got to work on them with coming to meetings sometime, too.
**Jdawson**: I know he's got a lot going on.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: But it's more helpful for him to be in here with us right now.
**Jdawson**: Thank.
**Jdawson**: Probably whatever he's doing.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, he seems to get busy a lot.
**Jcurtin**: Let me give him, give him a call.
**Jcurtin**: He's not answering.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So I guess we'll just, between the two of us, try to figure out what he needs to make sure that everything's on the same page.
**Jcurtin**: And then also we really have to get this schedule sorted out since we're so close to finishing up the project.
**Jdawson**: Can you prioritize that today and then kind of take into account what we're looking at for parking lot rework?
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, hopefully.
**Jcurtin**: Hopefully I'm able to get Jack on a call and we can do that.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, let me know if you can.
**Jdawson**: Let me see what I got going on today.
**Jcurtin**: It's just not the easiest getting him on meetings.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So my day is pretty much completely shot.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, yeah, I know we have that, we have that meeting at 3:30.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And then.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we got that.
**Jdawson**: And then I only after the meeting I had, this is the day I had to reschedule my eye appointment for 2 o', clock, which is five year time.
**Jdawson**: So I'll be offline for about 45 minutes at the end of the day and then I'm free.
**Jdawson**: I'm free from 2 to 2:30 your time.
**Jcurtin**: Due to 2:30.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, I think it should be something that me and Jack can, can sort out.
**Jcurtin**: I just, it's.
**Jdawson**: Oh yeah, I would fully agree.
**Jcurtin**: Get him to, to meet.
**Jcurtin**: So how.
**Jcurtin**: I'll try to schedule something with him today and hopefully he'll, he'll get on the meeting.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And then there's another meeting I have for some Panetoni project.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And it's just kind of starting out, so I'm not even sure if that's gonna happen.
**Jdawson**: They've just been canceling them.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Hey, Jack.
**Jcurtin**: Hey Jack.
**Jcurtin**: I think you're, you're on mute, Jack.
**Jdawson**: Do you want to just catch up with them?
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, yeah, I will.
**Jdawson**: Thanks, Nick.
**Jcurtin**: All right.
