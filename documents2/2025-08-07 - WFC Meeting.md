## Transcript
**Ctragesser**: Yeah.
**Fireflies**: If you don't mind doing that when we're done real quick, that'd be awesome because Brandon is wanting me to give him a rundown of this whole thing.
**Ctragesser**: Yeah.
**Ctragesser**: So, okay, you're talking about why we had so much spoils come out of the volleyball, right?
**Ctragesser**: Yeah.
**Fireflies**: The biggest thing is why do we have an $18,000 change order from Merit to do United's work?
**Fireflies**: And we have a $5,500 change order from United for 480 yards, I think.
**Ctragesser**: Okay.
**Ctragesser**: So the United one, you'll have to talk to Glenn on.
**Ctragesser**: I'm not sure that.
**Fireflies**: Yeah, I know about that.
**Ctragesser**: On the volleyball side, all of our foundations are at 99.
**Ctragesser**: 4.
**Ctragesser**: So if you don't build the building pad up to 99.4, now you're pouring concrete out of the ground.
**Ctragesser**: That was one of Merit's things.
**Ctragesser**: They said, look, if we can earth pour everything.
**Ctragesser**: Earth form.
**Ctragesser**: You know what earth form it means?
**Ctragesser**: Correct.
**Ctragesser**: You know, they just dig and they pour in the.
**Ctragesser**: In the earth mudslide actually have to form, then we're gonna save money.
**Ctragesser**: So now how.
**Ctragesser**: How can you do this on the volleyball end unless you just build the pad all the way across?
**Ctragesser**: Because if you would have left the center down and it rains as much as it did, we would have never gotten any of these footers in.
**Ctragesser**: Do you follow me on that?
**Fireflies**: Yep.
**Ctragesser**: So it's.
**Ctragesser**: Okay.
**Ctragesser**: So our options are either a, we basically create a bowl, right.
**Ctragesser**: And just do like a 10 foot path around the outside.
**Ctragesser**: And then the inside is just a freaking swimming pool that we're never going to be able to get to.
**Fireflies**: Yeah.
**Ctragesser**: And we're never going to get to dry up where we wouldn't even be as far as we are if we would have done that.
**Ctragesser**: So then, okay, you've got all your concrete done, and now you need the volleyball to be at -18.
**Ctragesser**: So you basically have to go in and take out 10 inches of dirt.
**Fireflies**: Yep.
**Fireflies**: And.
**Fireflies**: Yep, I knew that part.
**Ctragesser**: And get it out of here.
**Ctragesser**: Now why did United it or why did Merit end up doing it instead of United?
**Ctragesser**: The only reason I can think on that is United had a stupid high number and they were.
**Ctragesser**: It was going to be a very long time before they could get back here.
**Ctragesser**: And Glenn basically said, who?
**Ctragesser**: Well, who else can we get a hold of to do it?
**Ctragesser**: So I reached out to Merritt and said, hey, look how much you charge us to do this and get it out.
**Ctragesser**: They gave us a number.
**Ctragesser**: I said, get it to Glenn because, you know, I have no problem Reaching out to help, you know, coordinate something.
**Ctragesser**: But if it comes to money, I. Yeah, that needs to go over on that side of the table.
**Ctragesser**: If it goes to scheduling, it needs to come to my side of the table.
**Fireflies**: So can I.
**Fireflies**: Can I ask.
**Fireflies**: Let me think.
**Fireflies**: Was this talked about with Jesse or Brandon when this was all being decided to have Merit do it?
**Ctragesser**: That I do not know.
**Fireflies**: Okay.
**Ctragesser**: I know Glenn basically said, who else can we get a hold of?
**Ctragesser**: And I said, let me reach out to Kagan with Merit, see if they can do it, because they've got an excavator on site.
**Fireflies**: So it was technically out of scope work.
**Ctragesser**: Out of whose scope?
**Ctragesser**: Out of Merits.
**Fireflies**: Out of design scope?
**Ctragesser**: Yes.
**Ctragesser**: I mean, to me, it's a design bust.
**Ctragesser**: Yes.
**Ctragesser**: Because here's the other thing.
**Ctragesser**: So top of footing is at 99.4.
**Ctragesser**: So we.
**Ctragesser**: Our dirt has got to be at 99.4, right?
**Fireflies**: Yep.
**Ctragesser**: Okay.
**Ctragesser**: Do you know what our profile on the slab is on the collective?
**Ctragesser**: No.
**Ctragesser**: Six inches of stone, four inches of concrete.
**Ctragesser**: So what's that?
**Fireflies**: That's 10.
**Ctragesser**: That's 99.
**Fireflies**: Two.
**Fireflies**: Oh, you're talking in terms of elevations.
**Ctragesser**: Yes.
**Ctragesser**: Okay.
**Ctragesser**: So technically, we had to build even the building pad higher because the architect or the engineer, this Jerrica, doesn't know her left from her right.
**Fireflies**: Yeah.
**Ctragesser**: So that's to me.
**Ctragesser**: And then that's no different than all those exterior piers outside.
**Ctragesser**: Why are they so damn high up in the air?
**Ctragesser**: They should have been dropped to 99 and then concreted around the base of the column.
**Ctragesser**: And you're done.
**Fireflies**: Yeah.
**Ctragesser**: So again, that's it.
**Ctragesser**: To me, it's a scope issue.
**Fireflies**: It's a what?
**Ctragesser**: It's a design issue.
**Fireflies**: So was it ever intended to be earth poured, or was that something that Merit asked for now that you would.
**Ctragesser**: Have to go back to Glen on?
**Ctragesser**: Because that would have been during scope reviews and, like, when he was getting pricing for ve.
**Ctragesser**: I know.
**Ctragesser**: We had a conference call and I was on it.
**Ctragesser**: And Brandon was on it.
**Ctragesser**: Glenn was on it.
**Ctragesser**: The former estimator for Merit was on it.
**Ctragesser**: I was in Bloomington at that time covering Goodwill.
**Ctragesser**: Brandon had asked me to jump on because of my concrete background.
**Ctragesser**: And I was like, yeah, no problem.
**Ctragesser**: And I know in that meeting it was brought up by.
**Ctragesser**: Shit.
**Ctragesser**: What was his name?
**Ctragesser**: Brent Snow.
**Ctragesser**: As the former estimator for Merit.
**Ctragesser**: He's not with Merit anymore.
**Ctragesser**: Brent brought up.
**Ctragesser**: Hey, look, we've got to.
**Ctragesser**: We've got to Earth.
**Ctragesser**: Pour these or it's going to be a lot more money.
**Ctragesser**: Are you guys good with that.
**Ctragesser**: And I'm not sure who responded from our team.
**Ctragesser**: I know it wasn't me, but the response was, yes, we'll make sure you can earth poor.
**Fireflies**: And that's because of Jerrica's mess up on the design.
**Ctragesser**: Correct.
**Ctragesser**: Correct.
**Ctragesser**: And that's no difference.
**Ctragesser**: Like down on the volleyball end, they even talked about building these two pads in two different levels.
**Ctragesser**: The one at minus 10 and then the volleyball end at minus 18.
**Ctragesser**: And then you would have to form up the top of your footers to get to minus 8 for your curve.
**Fireflies**: Yeah.
**Ctragesser**: So you've been forming up 10 inch all the way around the perimeter of this building.
**Ctragesser**: And that's when Merit was like, look, this is going to be, you know, salty if we do this way.
**Ctragesser**: If you bank poor, it's a lot more.
**Ctragesser**: It's a lot.
**Ctragesser**: You know, it's not going to cost you nearly as much.
**Ctragesser**: And now that call.
**Ctragesser**: I do know Brandon was on.
**Ctragesser**: I do know Glenn was on.
**Ctragesser**: I was on.
**Ctragesser**: Just more from the aspect of listening to what Merit suggesting for their VE options and seeing if I could think of anything also that we could have them be to save money on the concrete side.
**Fireflies**: Okay.
**Ctragesser**: And I don't know if there was fireflies on that meeting or not.
**Ctragesser**: I believe Glenn organized that meeting.
**Ctragesser**: I could look back through and see if I've got fireflies on that meeting.
**Fireflies**: That would be awesome.
**Fireflies**: If you could just check.
**Ctragesser**: I'm doing it right now.
**Ctragesser**: I'm trying to think.
**Fireflies**: I'm gonna check Brandon too, because he said that he's.
**Fireflies**: He records his meetings.
**Ctragesser**: That would have had to.
**Ctragesser**: Ben.
**Ctragesser**: We started this in April, so that would have been back in.
**Ctragesser**: I'm just going through all my March fireflies right now.
**Ctragesser**: I think it's further back in this.
**Ctragesser**: That's stair and railing diction, design company ops meeting, lighting discussion.
**Fireflies**: Would it be on your calendar?
**Ctragesser**: It should be the six concrete scope review.
**Ctragesser**: Okay.
**Ctragesser**: So that is March 6th.
**Ctragesser**: Go back here.
**Ctragesser**: Three, six.
**Ctragesser**: Not six, three.
**Ctragesser**: I'm going dyslexic on you, Jesse.
**Fireflies**: Join the club band.
**Ctragesser**: And this.
**Ctragesser**: If this pulls up what I think it is, I'll just forward you this email on.
**Ctragesser**: And that will, you know, again, you're.
**Ctragesser**: You're playing catch up from who said what to who.
**Fireflies**: And oh, yeah, it's totally who's on first.
**Ctragesser**: Yeah.
**Ctragesser**: And you're like, what?
**Ctragesser**: And that's.
**Ctragesser**: That's hard to do.
**Fireflies**: Oh, yeah.
**Fireflies**: Especially when you got a bunch of other, like, high priority stuff to get done.
**Fireflies**: Welcome to the industry.
**Ctragesser**: Yep.
**Ctragesser**: I'm gonna Forward this on to Jesse.
**Ctragesser**: No, Jesse.
**Ctragesser**: Number two, Remillard.
**Ctragesser**: We found the true Jesse today.
**Fireflies**: You did?
**Ctragesser**: Yep.
**Fireflies**: The true one.
**Ctragesser**: No, he's the superintendent for the slip.
**Ctragesser**: The.
**Ctragesser**: For the curb site crew out here.
**Fireflies**: Oh, yeah.
**Ctragesser**: Jesse also, like.
**Ctragesser**: I'm like, yeah, dude, that's not over.
**Ctragesser**: I'm like, we already got two other Jesse's.
**Ctragesser**: He's like, no, no, I'm.
**Ctragesser**: I'm done, Jesse.
**Fireflies**: And then we got the fire one.
**Fireflies**: Jesse Pfeiffer is a tee on this one.
**Ctragesser**: Jesse Pfeiffer.
**Ctragesser**: Yeah.
**Fireflies**: For the fire sprinklers.
**Ctragesser**: No, I don't.
**Ctragesser**: That's Chris Lopez.
**Fireflies**: Oh, Adelphi.
**Fireflies**: I think he's works for.
**Ctragesser**: Let's say.
**Ctragesser**: No, our fire sprinklers.
**Ctragesser**: Siemens.
**Ctragesser**: So, I mean, does that help clear anything up for you?
**Ctragesser**: Does that make it worse?
**Ctragesser**: Better?
**Fireflies**: Yeah, I guess.
**Fireflies**: The.
**Fireflies**: The thing Brandon's trying to figure out is why did it cost him 23 grand between the $18,000 merit change order and the United $5,500 change order?
**Fireflies**: He's just trying to.
**Ctragesser**: United's change order.
**Ctragesser**: I don't know what that's all about.
**Fireflies**: I know enough about that one to know what it's about.
**Fireflies**: Basically, I think what happened there was United accounted for 1400 yards, and their contract says all import, export.
**Ctragesser**: Yes.
**Fireflies**: So they had a.
**Fireflies**: There was a time conflict with digging out the utilities.
**Fireflies**: And the pad was already established in the building.
**Ctragesser**: Yeah.
**Ctragesser**: No, 100%.
**Ctragesser**: So if we would have dug all of our utilities and like, even all of our curb islands or curves and everything.
**Ctragesser**: Yes.
**Ctragesser**: Then we.
**Ctragesser**: Then we would have you and used all those spoils on the building pad.
**Ctragesser**: That would have been a different story.
**Fireflies**: Yeah.
**Ctragesser**: Anywhere Our utilities are not in the parking lot.
**Ctragesser**: That's all backfilled with just a foot of stone.
**Ctragesser**: And then all dirt by code, we have to backfill with stone up to the flow line, which is halfway up on the pipe, and then we can go dirt.
**Ctragesser**: So, like, when we were out in the easement and we're off the parking lot, all that was back till, you know, like I said, just minimum sound and then dirt.
**Ctragesser**: So, like, those spoils, we didn't have to take any of those off, thank God.
**Ctragesser**: But now, like anything.
**Ctragesser**: Like now on site, which you were on the email I sent out to all the subs yesterday.
**Ctragesser**: You saw that email, correct?
**Fireflies**: Yep.
**Ctragesser**: You know, basically, that's me basically saying, hey, look, you guys, we're done.
**Ctragesser**: We're done digging through here.
**Ctragesser**: It's on your dime now.
**Ctragesser**: So.
**Ctragesser**: But yeah, so that had that meeting had on it.
**Ctragesser**: Brandon, Jesse.
**Ctragesser**: Wayne.
**Ctragesser**: That doesn't seem right.
**Ctragesser**: Wayne Newcomer.
**Ctragesser**: Yeah, but Wayne's the new estimator.
**Ctragesser**: Well, Wayne could have been there then, though.
**Ctragesser**: I think he might have.
**Ctragesser**: I'm just want to look at my calendar invite again and see who it says was on it.
**Ctragesser**: Gotta make sure I go back far enough.
**Fireflies**: Kind of feel like an archaeologist, doesn't it?
**Ctragesser**: No.
**Ctragesser**: You're 100.
**Ctragesser**: Right.
**Ctragesser**: Which I'm glad I. I keep all my, you know, emails and.
**Fireflies**: Oh, yeah, I do too.
**Fireflies**: I keep all my texts and everything.
**Ctragesser**: Yeah, I do text also, but like.
**Fireflies**: Yeah, that Crazy Girl from 2008 wants to try some.
**Fireflies**: I still have the text messages.
**Ctragesser**: All right.
**Ctragesser**: You know what the sad thing is?
**Ctragesser**: I'm pretty sure Trevor Bauer wishes he kept all his text messages, too.
**Fireflies**: Epstein's probably thinking the same thing.
**Ctragesser**: Yep.
**Ctragesser**: Yeah, see, like, I can't click on who was actually in the meeting, who accepted it, who didn't.
**Fireflies**: You just see the scheduling assistant list?
**Ctragesser**: I don't have that up here.
**Fireflies**: It's.
**Fireflies**: It's a.
**Fireflies**: See the tab up on the top, towards the left?
**Fireflies**: It says scheduling assistant on the meeting invite when you open it.
**Ctragesser**: Oh, I do see that.
**Fireflies**: Click on it.
**Fireflies**: So that's going to be a sweet tool, man.
**Ctragesser**: So, yeah.
**Ctragesser**: So who was invited to.
**Ctragesser**: It was Glenn, of course, Brandon, Jesse, Brent Wright, myself, Fred at Fireflies, and Wayne Newcomer.
**Ctragesser**: Wayne is the, like, main estimator for him, which he wasn't even on that call.
**Ctragesser**: I know he was not.
**Ctragesser**: Yeah, because we didn't even.
**Ctragesser**: I didn't even talk to Wayne or deal with Wayne until Brent left.
**Fireflies**: Merritt, can you do me a favor?
**Ctragesser**: Yeah.
**Fireflies**: Can you just send me a snippet of the list with the.
**Fireflies**: The little heading of the meeting name up in the top and just put a red X by who wasn't there.
**Fireflies**: Just mark it up and snippet.
**Ctragesser**: Yeah.
**Ctragesser**: Okay, let's see.
**Ctragesser**: Snippet.
**Ctragesser**: He wants a snippet.
**Fireflies**: Well, if you can forward me the invite.
**Fireflies**: I don't know if you can forward old ones like that.
**Ctragesser**: Let's just do this.
**Ctragesser**: Who was not in the meeting.
**Ctragesser**: Let's just highlight them with.
**Ctragesser**: That's kind of a pinkish red.
**Fireflies**: That's always a good thing.
**Ctragesser**: Now, this is who I know was in the meeting.
**Ctragesser**: I know Brent was.
**Ctragesser**: I know Brandon was.
**Ctragesser**: I know myself was.
**Ctragesser**: And I can even go far back as I can tell you exactly where I took the meeting call from.
**Ctragesser**: Like where I was at on Goodwill, Bloomington, because I had to go out to my vehicle and set in the vehicle in the parking lot.
**Ctragesser**: Because it was so loud in the building.
**Ctragesser**: Because I was doing demo.
**Fireflies**: Oh, yeah.
**Ctragesser**: So, I mean, like, I can even dial it that far back for you, buddy.
**Ctragesser**: Save it.
**Ctragesser**: Throw it on my desktop so I've got it there.
**Ctragesser**: And then I can get out of this.
**Ctragesser**: I can get out of this.
**Ctragesser**: Close that.
**Ctragesser**: Throw this over here.
**Ctragesser**: I asked that.
**Ctragesser**: What are you looking at, homie?
**Ctragesser**: I don't give two shits about your collective pictures that you're getting from Ian.
**Ctragesser**: TV's almost too out of it.
**Ctragesser**: Oh, I hate it when the TV's too high.
**Ctragesser**: Okay, so I just sent it to you in the chat of this meeting.
**Ctragesser**: So you've got it there.
**Ctragesser**: And then I'm going to double down on this.
**Fireflies**: And.
**Ctragesser**: Go, here, new mail.
**Ctragesser**: Grab that screenshot again.
**Ctragesser**: Throw it here.
**Ctragesser**: Why is it not throwing curds?
**Ctragesser**: And look at them.
**Ctragesser**: Need to.
**Ctragesser**: And I just email it to you also, buddy.
**Fireflies**: Thank you.
**Ctragesser**: Oh, not a problem, dude.
**Ctragesser**: Like I said, I'm.
**Ctragesser**: I'm not trying to blame anybody here, but to me, more of the blame lies back on the design side.
**Fireflies**: Yeah, you know, it sounds like Jerrica kind of this up from the start.
**Ctragesser**: Well, I mean, again, let's.
**Ctragesser**: You built enough of these buildings, how would you have done the volleyball end with the center needing to be minus 18?
**Ctragesser**: And again, let's keep in mind, the month of June, we had 9 plus inches of rain, and the month of May, we had like 7 to 8 inches of rain.
**Ctragesser**: So that's almost 20 inches of rain in two months.
**Ctragesser**: So I would have just built the perimeter right and left that 18 inches down.
**Ctragesser**: How would that have worked?
**Ctragesser**: I mean, we could have never gotten around this thing.
**Fireflies**: No, there's no.
**Fireflies**: That's pretty much the obvious solution to that correction.
**Ctragesser**: Yeah.
**Ctragesser**: I mean, so, like, I. I don't know.
**Ctragesser**: You know, I'm just trying to figure it out as well as you are.
**Fireflies**: Yeah, it's.
**Fireflies**: It's just.
**Fireflies**: Yeah, that's weird because for merit to come back and say that they wanted to pour it without forming, like mud slab or whatever you call it there.
**Ctragesser**: Earth.
**Ctragesser**: Earthboard or earth forming.
**Ctragesser**: Yeah.
**Fireflies**: So that was just compensating for a design error.
**Ctragesser**: Yeah.
**Ctragesser**: I mean, truly, that's exactly what I would.
**Ctragesser**: I would classify that as.
**Ctragesser**: But again, I mean.
**Fireflies**: Which is still on us because it's design build.
**Ctragesser**: Yeah.
**Ctragesser**: Then.
**Ctragesser**: So this was on July 6th at 6:17 at night.
**Ctragesser**: This is when Glenn asked me to reach out to Kagan and get, you know, whatever.
**Ctragesser**: And I said, okay.
**Ctragesser**: I said, get me a price.
**Ctragesser**: And then he called me and said, hey, I sent it to you.
**Ctragesser**: I said, yeah.
**Ctragesser**: I said, no, you need to send that to Glenn, but I've got the text.
**Ctragesser**: So I literally just took a screenshot of, you know, where we're talking about it and I'm.
**Fireflies**: Oh, thank you.
**Ctragesser**: Send that to you via text, Jesse.
**Ctragesser**: I've got three.
**Ctragesser**: Jesse's in my phone now.
**Ctragesser**: Hey, you should get a text from me, brother.
**Fireflies**: There it is.
**Fireflies**: Phone service is horrible here.
**Ctragesser**: Yeah.
**Ctragesser**: So who's all at St. Pete with you?
**Ctragesser**: Is it just you?
**Fireflies**: Alec and Keba have been here all week, and Nick just got back this morning.
**Ctragesser**: Who's Al?
**Ctragesser**: Oh, Alex.
**Ctragesser**: He's the new pn, isn't he?
**Fireflies**: Apm.
**Fireflies**: Yeah.
**Ctragesser**: Yeah.
**Ctragesser**: So he.
**Fireflies**: Yeah, he's good.
**Ctragesser**: So he knows.
**Ctragesser**: He knows Kagan.
**Ctragesser**: They used to work together at Willhell.
**Fireflies**: Oh, yeah, that's right.
**Fireflies**: He's from up there.
**Ctragesser**: Yeah.
**Ctragesser**: So the site or the concrete project manager for Merrick up here, huh?
**Ctragesser**: And Alec, they know each other really well.
**Fireflies**: Oh, gotcha.
**Ctragesser**: Yeah, like they.
**Ctragesser**: And they're.
**Ctragesser**: They're kind of like twinning brothers with their mullets.
**Fireflies**: Yeah.
**Fireflies**: Oh, I. I saw that guy on site while I was there, I think.
**Ctragesser**: Yeah.
**Ctragesser**: Yeah, he's kind of a taller guy.
**Ctragesser**: Big.
**Fireflies**: Yep.
**Fireflies**: Yeah.
**Ctragesser**: Yeah.
**Fireflies**: And then Camden was here on Monday, but he went to Dallas Monday night or Tuesday morning.
**Ctragesser**: I like Canyon.
**Fireflies**: Yeah, everybody down here is cool.
**Ctragesser**: Yeah.
**Ctragesser**: So no, Jesse D. Called earlier.
**Ctragesser**: He was heading up to Kokomo to go look at a job.
**Ctragesser**: But you asked me, he's like, how far is this from your house?
**Ctragesser**: About the same drive as Westfield is like, well, how can one be.
**Ctragesser**: How can they be the same?
**Ctragesser**: I'm like, you know, I can be the Kokomo in 20 minutes or I can be to Westfield in 20 minutes.
**Fireflies**: So it is saying, oh, that's not bad.
**Ctragesser**: No, I just.
**Ctragesser**: I literally leave my house and I go right to 31 and I just.
**Ctragesser**: If I want to go Kokomo, I turn north.
**Ctragesser**: If I want to go Westfield south.
**Ctragesser**: And I mean, you know, 31, like the speed limit 60.
**Ctragesser**: So minimum you're going to run if you don't want to get ran over.
**Ctragesser**: 65.
**Fireflies**: Yeah, that's a good call on school.
**Fireflies**: Starting to real good on the foresight with that one.
**Ctragesser**: Well, so last year before they had this roundabout in down here to the east, traffic would literally back up past the road to the west of us and just be like, I'm talking probably like a half a mile past that road backed up.
**Fireflies**: If I can, I just fireflies out.
**Fireflies**: Will it?
**Fireflies**: Will it still record what we've all already talked about?
**Ctragesser**: Hold on.
**Ctragesser**: Let's see.
**Ctragesser**: We should just be able to kick fireflies out now.
**Fireflies**: Remove from meeting.
**Fireflies**: So I didn't mean to interrupt.
**Fireflies**: I figured just turn it off so I will find them for that stuff.
