## Transcript
**Bclymer**: Hey, Maria.
**Speaker 1**: Hi.
**Speaker 1**: How are you?
**Bclymer**: Well, nice office.
**Speaker 1**: I know, right?
**Speaker 1**: I just change it.
**Speaker 1**: Remodel.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So the open phone thing, did you.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I saw your ticket.
**Bclymer**: Have they got back to you on that?
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, so they usually they reply, but I have to check your calendar.
**Speaker 1**: Your calendar know your email because they send it to your email.
**Speaker 1**: I'm checking phone.
**Speaker 1**: But let me see.
**Speaker 1**: On others.
**Speaker 1**: Usually it's on others.
**Speaker 1**: So what they need to do is because I already verify the phone.
**Speaker 1**: So here it is.
**Speaker 1**: Open phone went.
**Speaker 1**: Hello.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, so I will.
**Speaker 1**: I will follow up with this.
**Speaker 1**: So I already verified like at the beginning, but I don't know what.
**Speaker 1**: What happened.
**Speaker 1**: So we'll check.
**Speaker 1**: Because when I call, I don't.
**Speaker 1**: It doesn't.
**Speaker 1**: I don't hear any message.
**Speaker 1**: So I'm like, we'll figure out.
**Bclymer**: Maybe it's because you're not calling from the U.S.
**Bclymer**: well, this is supposed to.
**Speaker 1**: Be a U.S.
**Speaker 1**: number, but you're right.
**Speaker 1**: Maybe it's, you know, the.
**Speaker 1**: The tracking or the IP or something is Colombia.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, that's gotta be what it is.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, so Andrew just replied to me that we don't need to take the test.
**Speaker 1**: I think he calls somebody and the person is going to send an email to confirm that.
**Bclymer**: All right, so we need to figure out what.
**Bclymer**: All we need to do.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So I'm going to cancel the test.
**Speaker 1**: And then Jesse.
**Speaker 1**: I think Jesse already finished.
**Speaker 1**: One second.
**Speaker 1**: I think Jesse already canceled his book because he had a book that he wanted to purchase for cancer.
**Speaker 1**: So he thinks he canceled it.
**Speaker 1**: So.
**Speaker 1**: So that's good.
**Speaker 1**: So now let me just cancel the test and then what else?
**Speaker 1**: I already asked Lisa for the things that we need for the.
**Speaker 1**: For the other Arkansas thing.
**Speaker 1**: So that's good.
**Speaker 1**: She will be.
**Speaker 1**: Send that to us.
**Speaker 1**: I ask accounting for the financial statement or working on it.
**Speaker 1**: And I think that's it.
**Speaker 1**: From the Arkansas thing.
**Speaker 1**: We're just waiting on things.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: For the insurance audit, I know that one of the requests they had was for all the certificate of cois from.
**Bclymer**: They had like a list of subs or whatever.
**Bclymer**: Do you.
**Bclymer**: Can you get with, you know, Jose and Fritzi and make sure that like, pull the ones that we have and if there's any that we don't have, they need to send out emails, you know, and make sure that we get those.
**Bclymer**: And like, we need to.
**Bclymer**: They need to be hammering on that.
**Bclymer**: We need to get that done.
**Speaker 1**: The contracts correct.
**Bclymer**: It's the certificate of insurance of our subcontractors for.
**Bclymer**: He said the guy Sent a list of them.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So you can find that email and, you know, get all that stuff.
**Bclymer**: So that way we can shut that.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, so here it is.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, perfect.
**Speaker 1**: So that will do that.
**Speaker 1**: What other things?
**Bclymer**: And then I responded to Don.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I saw that, the PTO stuff.
**Bclymer**: We need to get that figured out, like, because again, like, we've got people that, you know, took pto, but it wasn't working.
**Bclymer**: We need to go back in and backdate that stuff.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, okay, perfect.
**Speaker 1**: So also receive the alpha graphics card for Mike and Jack.
**Speaker 1**: So that's all because I repeat for it.
**Speaker 1**: So it will be good to come to the office.
**Speaker 1**: What about the sponsorship thing for the one for Dave and the one for the Aura Hotel?
**Bclymer**: All right, so let's look at David.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, so Dave is, I mean, I will say basic package, but I don't know if you have probably, you know, participated more on his event.
**Speaker 1**: So just let me know if it's good for that or not.
**Bclymer**: See here.
**Speaker 1**: Now that's good enough.
**Bclymer**: So I thought, I thought that for some reason I thought he said it was like 6,500, but I can't remember, it was 7,000.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, so you said, I think you offer 60, 65 for.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, no, but this is, this is Dave, right?
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, no, that's different.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, so I will suggest basic, but I don't know, that's up to you.
**Speaker 1**: I mean.
**Bclymer**: What would you suggest?
**Speaker 1**: I mean, I will suggest basic because I don't know if you have in the past, you know, events with him, if, if you had in the past events with him and you are actually get a lot of exposure, then Premium will be the best.
**Speaker 1**: You have three minutes talking and everything.
**Speaker 1**: But since I don't know if you have like good engagement before.
**Speaker 1**: So what do you think?
**Speaker 1**: I will say, I mean, if you had obviously just take the opportunity to talk three minutes and everything.
**Bclymer**: I'm just looking at.
**Bclymer**: So like this one, you get full guest list names, Instagram handles and emails.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, yeah, he said that.
**Speaker 1**: You're right.
**Speaker 1**: So he said.
**Speaker 1**: Actually I asked him also about the magazine and he said it's better Instagram handles and in emails and etc.
**Speaker 1**: Than magazines and everything.
**Speaker 1**: And I said, okay.
**Speaker 1**: Still we are waiting for the magazine for the previous event that you have.
**Speaker 1**: But he mentioned that he can give us, give us everything, you know, Instagram handles and emails from the package.
**Speaker 1**: So.
**Bclymer**: I mean, I don't, I don't necessarily think 5,000 is worth it at all.
**Bclymer**: Like, if you're going to do 5,000, you might as well do seven.
**Bclymer**: Because the stuff that you get for it is way more.
**Bclymer**: I mean like educated photographer, you know.
**Speaker 1**: No, and I like that you had the time to speak.
**Speaker 1**: I mean, it's important and you get the handles.
**Speaker 1**: That's true.
**Bclymer**: I also don't know what I would say.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, no.
**Speaker 1**: We can always figure out your story, your background, your accomplishments, projects, everything.
**Bclymer**: Let's see, five minutes.
**Bclymer**: Positioned during a high energy moment.
**Bclymer**: You're introduced by our host and given the floor.
**Bclymer**: Speak directly to our room.
**Bclymer**: Founders, creators, task bankers, custom tailored suit.
**Bclymer**: That's interesting.
**Bclymer**: What podcast is this, I wonder?
**Speaker 1**: Probably the one that he creates.
**Speaker 1**: The podcast you have with him.
**Speaker 1**: Remember, that wasn't.
**Bclymer**: We didn't do a podcast.
**Bclymer**: We just did a little interview clip thing.
**Bclymer**: Like we just literally would like all those clips that you saw.
**Bclymer**: Like, literally it would just be like that was it like it wasn't actual podcast.
**Speaker 1**: It was like a podcasting.
**Bclymer**: No, no, it's just like, you know, we had like six, eight questions and they, you know, they'd roll it, ask the question, and then that way they can make shorts from it.
**Speaker 1**: Gotcha.
**Speaker 1**: Well, it says full length interview video plus audio broadcast over to 5,500,000 plus subscribers.
**Speaker 1**: YouTube, Spotify, Apple.
**Speaker 1**: That's good.
**Speaker 1**: How many you have?
**Speaker 1**: I think five minutes for that one to.
**Bclymer**: So what.
**Bclymer**: All right, so this is.
**Bclymer**: So here's the event, right?
**Bclymer**: April 25th.
**Speaker 1**: No, April 25th.
**Speaker 1**: No, is.
**Speaker 1**: I think he said, he said.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I know.
**Speaker 1**: I told him.
**Speaker 1**: So the event is May 17, 7pm to 12pm I told him the date is not updated.
**Bclymer**: Saturday, correct.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I mean, I guess 7,000 or.
**Bclymer**: No, I don't, I don't want to do 10 grand.
**Bclymer**: I.
**Bclymer**: I guess part of me doesn't even understand what it is.
**Speaker 1**: I know.
**Speaker 1**: You have no idea.
**Speaker 1**: I was, I went and I asked Dave, I'm like, dave, the date is not accurate.
**Speaker 1**: Like, what is it about?
**Speaker 1**: I just saw pictures of you having fun, you know, but I don't see the.
**Speaker 1**: So what is it about?
**Bclymer**: Did you know?
**Speaker 1**: It's just more like a.
**Speaker 1**: And you see.
**Bclymer**: Did he get back to you or what?
**Speaker 1**: No, he just said.
**Speaker 1**: He said to me, hi, Maria, the writing featured because I asked about the magazine.
**Speaker 1**: So he said it's complete.
**Speaker 1**: It's just the design process that is taking a long time.
**Speaker 1**: It is a free magazine, so the content is what caused zero.
**Speaker 1**: Instead of the Instagram photos I have shared, I've got pushed back due to design.
**Speaker 1**: Blah, blah, blah.
**Speaker 1**: Thank you so much for letting me know.
**Speaker 1**: The event is May 17, 7pm 10pm that's it.
**Bclymer**: Seven to midnight?
**Speaker 1**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Which one is it?
**Bclymer**: What is the.
**Bclymer**: Is the time 7 to 10 or 7 to midnight?
**Speaker 1**: No, 7 to 10pm Gotcha.
**Bclymer**: Hold on one second.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, as a brand.
**Bclymer**: Okay, you're on your way.
**Bclymer**: Okay, great.
**Bclymer**: Thanks.
**Bclymer**: But.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I don't know.
**Bclymer**: I mean, I guess I'll.
**Bclymer**: You know, I would say, you know, the middle one probably would be the one.
**Bclymer**: I'll.
**Bclymer**: I'll.
**Bclymer**: I'll.
**Bclymer**: I'll message him and ask him back.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: So what is this?
**Bclymer**: Just a party?
**Bclymer**: Like, I don't understand.
**Speaker 1**: Like, yeah, it looks like it, but that was what I was going to ask you, like, if you had events in the past with Dave, like, are they even good for you or is it just like a, you know, Networking.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Like, so the only.
**Bclymer**: I've only been to, you know, two events.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Which is a very loose terminology.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: One of them was just like, he, like, messaged me and he was like, hey, like, we're doing like, a photo shoot thing.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Which is the picture you see of me on that.
**Bclymer**: That page.
**Bclymer**: I mean, and that's all it really was.
**Bclymer**: Just like, you know, people hanging out of the little photo thing, like, nothing at all.
**Bclymer**: And then the other one was his.
**Bclymer**: His very first, I think, event when in Tampa, which was, I don't know, like last fall.
**Bclymer**: And that was just at.
**Bclymer**: At, you know, the Huron.
**Bclymer**: And it was literally just a little party thing.
**Bclymer**: Like, there was nothing crazy or special about it.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I mean, I guess.
**Bclymer**: I guess that's it.
**Bclymer**: Again, I just don't know.
**Bclymer**: Like, I'll ask and be like, I don't.
**Bclymer**: I guess I just don't.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, let's just.
**Bclymer**: Let's just like.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, just to make sure.
**Speaker 1**: If we can ask him numbers, like, hey, you know, like, engagement and everything.
**Speaker 1**: Exposure, you know, because I saw the pictures and I'm like, this is cool.
**Speaker 1**: But, you know, and I saw a lot of pictures of you with them, and I'm like, also, probably you already have with them, so.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, so let's ask him.
**Speaker 1**: And then let me know what we want to.
**Speaker 1**: How do you want to choose?
**Speaker 1**: And then for the Aura Hotel in Miami, you offer 6500.
**Speaker 1**: 6.
**Speaker 1**: 500 for an open bar?
