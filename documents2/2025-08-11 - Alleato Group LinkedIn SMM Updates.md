**Bclymer**: Got a quick call today.

**Bclymer**: You can wait for a couple minutes if you want to wait for her.
**Jdawson**: Sure, she is.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: But we can go ahead and start.
**Jdawson**: I mean, if you just need me to look at some stuff.
**Bclymer**: Sure.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So what we want to look at is the topping out ceremony posts that Maria was able to send over before.
**Bclymer**: So I'm just gonna scroll down.

**Jdawson**: Can you edit it so I don't have hugest pit stains?
**Bclymer**: I can try.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah, I can fix it.
**Bclymer**: And if I can't fix it, I'll choose a different photo.
**Jdawson**: I would scroll back up.
**Jdawson**: That one would keep going.
**Jdawson**: One more.
**Jdawson**: I don't know about having that one on there.
**Jdawson**: I mean, with the baby, it's a minor, you know.
**Bclymer**: Gotcha.

**Bclymer**: Absolutely.
**Bclymer**: I can find another one of them people that doesn't include a kid.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: What's the.
**Bclymer**: Here's the caption.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I mean, I would just say one thing.

**Jdawson**: February 2020.
**Bclymer**: Is it February or whatever it is?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I would just say Westfield Collective opening, February 2026.

**Bclymer**: So there's just two things with that.
**Bclymer**: And then Maria mentioned that you guys had some new hires coming this August.
