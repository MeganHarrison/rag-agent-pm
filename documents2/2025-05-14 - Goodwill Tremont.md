## Transcript
**Adelgado**: Good morning.
**Njepson**: I'll just wait for Andrew to get on.
**Adelgado**: Exactly.
**Adelgado**: Yeah.
**Adelgado**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: Going all right today?
**Adelgado**: All fine.
**Adelgado**: And you?
**Njepson**: Yeah, yeah, Doing all right.
**Adelgado**: Perfect.
**Speaker 2**: General.
**Adelgado**: J.
**Speaker 2**: Let.
**Adelgado**: Me.
**Njepson**: Hey, Andrew.
**Speaker 2**: Morning.
**Njepson**: Hey.
**Njepson**: Morning.
**Adelgado**: Morning.
**Njepson**: So do you just want to go over what.
**Njepson**: What you need to go over with the subs on Friday?
**Speaker 2**: Yes.
**Speaker 3**: It doesn't.
**Speaker 3**: I've been looking at it for the last kind of hour and a half and most of it makes sense.
**Speaker 3**: I have some general questions, but.
**Njepson**: Who'S going.
**Njepson**: Going there on Friday?
**Speaker 3**: I am.
**Njepson**: The.
**Njepson**: Which subs, which trades.
**Speaker 2**: See.
**Speaker 3**: Like mission mechanical fight, which I believe is H Vac.
**Njepson**: There.
**Njepson**: There's two H Vac served.
**Adelgado**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: And I know JL Suggesting.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, yeah.
**Speaker 3**: They are framing, drywall, paint, flooring.
**Speaker 3**: Believe that's all as of now.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: Here's Justin.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, Justin will be there.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: Are you gonna have them all come at the same time?
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, that's what I was planning on doing.
**Speaker 3**: Unless that I need to change it.
**Speaker 3**: But like, jail looks like the only.
**Speaker 3**: They asked to go either Monday, Tuesday or Thursday this week.
**Speaker 3**: I really don't want to go Thursday.
**Speaker 3**: Because of what's going on site here.
**Njepson**: Or.
**Njepson**: Are you on a job site?
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, I was.
**Speaker 3**: Brandon put me on collective full time.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Speaker 3**: So it looks like JL May not be able to go.
**Speaker 3**: I need a call when we get off this call, I'm gonna go.
**Njepson**: So it's probably just mechanical you're looking at then if jail's not able to.
**Speaker 3**: Make it as of now.
**Speaker 3**: Correct.
**Adelgado**: Okay.
**Njepson**: So that would just be walking the area.
**Njepson**: Just showing them the area where having some new ceilings put in.
**Njepson**: So they're gonna have to rework the mechanical where we're redoing the ceilings, which I don't know if you have the ceiling plan, Andrew.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, Here, let me share my screen.
**Adelgado**: I think it's in the last.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: So these two areas.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: Is it?
**Njepson**: I guess that's the only place where we're doing the ceilings.
**Speaker 3**: Looks like I could see.
**Speaker 3**: Is it.
**Speaker 3**: Do you know if this is what ceiling is over here?
**Speaker 3**: Because I know Jared's office is changing in size.
**Speaker 3**: This back wall comes out.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: So that could cause some issues.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: If they're taking the wall out, then this.
**Njepson**: The ceiling.
**Njepson**: They're probably.
**Njepson**: They probably are gonna have to mess with it.
**Adelgado**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: Other than that, I don't think there's much.
**Njepson**: Should be.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: Pretty straightforward for them.
**Speaker 3**: So are they.
**Speaker 3**: Are they gonna.
**Speaker 3**: I mean, is it.
**Speaker 3**: Are the ceilings getting lower or higher in these two areas.
**Njepson**: The storage area?
**Njepson**: There's actually a Mezzanine.
**Speaker 3**: Is it.
**Speaker 3**: Is that existing or are they adding it?
**Njepson**: They're.
**Njepson**: They're building it.
**Speaker 3**: They're.
**Speaker 3**: They're adding it.
**Speaker 3**: Okay.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: Okay.
**Njepson**: There should be a note on the.
**Njepson**: The other drawings about the mezzanine.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, yeah.
**Speaker 3**: So these ceilings must be pretty high to be able to add a second floor.
**Njepson**: And.
**Speaker 3**: Is that right?
**Njepson**: I.
**Njepson**: I remember Tara said something about.
**Njepson**: I think she wanted H Vac in the storage area.
**Njepson**: She would.
**Njepson**: She wanted a price for.
**Njepson**: For it.
**Speaker 3**: I see H Vac on mezzanine.
**Njepson**: Oh, yeah, yeah.
**Speaker 3**: Is that what you're referring to?
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: And if they.
**Njepson**: If they ask about if we should cool the storage area, say, oh, yeah.
**Njepson**: Provide a separate price for cooling the storage area.
**Njepson**: Because I don't think she was 100% for sure she wanted that, so she just wanted a separate prints.
**Njepson**: Would they have these drawings?
**Njepson**: Andrus.
**Adelgado**: This drawing is what was from Abanov.
**Adelgado**: I don't remember.
**Njepson**: You sent them the drawings?
**Adelgado**: Well, I sent the drawings for all the subs.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Njepson**: So they.
**Njepson**: They have the drawings.
**Njepson**: So they really just need to see that area.
**Adelgado**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: They'll just have to see, like, what the existing H Vac is there and what they need to do to.
**Njepson**: To modify it.
**Speaker 3**: So when they rework that H Vac, are they wanting, you know, to reuse as much as possible of existing equipment or all new?
**Njepson**: Yeah, yeah.
**Speaker 3**: Reuse as much as possible.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: So what are they.
**Speaker 3**: What are they putting down just to create that mezzanine here?
**Njepson**: Yeah, they're gonna have columns and then floor joists.
**Njepson**: Is there anything plywood?
**Speaker 3**: I didn't know if there's anything specifically called out.
**Speaker 3**: It doesn't look like is just yet, but no worries.
**Speaker 3**: I notice there's, like, these new walls don't have wall types.
**Njepson**: Right.
**Speaker 3**: So these are going to be new columns that they add to new Earth.
**Speaker 3**: There's 1, 2, 3.
**Njepson**: Yeah, I don't think.
**Njepson**: I think those are added.
**Njepson**: And if you do end up walking with JL and they.
**Njepson**: They have some questions, you can call me.
**Speaker 3**: Appreciate it.
**Speaker 3**: I will.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, I'll.
**Speaker 3**: Sure.
**Speaker 3**: Justin will respond here in a bit.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, I'll reach out if need be.
**Speaker 3**: So this H Vac will be on this.
**Speaker 3**: This on top of the mezzanine floor.
**Speaker 2**: Is it.
**Speaker 2**: What.
**Speaker 3**: What is exactly going there?
**Speaker 3**: Like an actual unit.
**Njepson**: That I'm not entirely.
**Njepson**: Entirely sure because usually they're.
**Njepson**: They're outside.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: Andres, what have you been telling mechanical H vac?
**Adelgado**: Let me check, because.
**Njepson**: I.
**Njepson**: I guess just show it to the H Vac guys and see what they say.
**Njepson**: And maybe.
**Njepson**: Maybe they'll know what it is.
**Njepson**: Usually the units are outside because they.
**Njepson**: Yeah, they release the heat outside and then bring the cool air inside.
**Adelgado**: CNS estimate this scope.
**Njepson**: Yeah, they did.
**Njepson**: They walked us.
**Njepson**: Right.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Njepson**: They had a heat pump.
**Speaker 3**: Electric furnace.
**Speaker 3**: Heat pump.
**Njepson**: That must be the electric furnace that's in there.
**Njepson**: That's the only thing that would make sense.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: JL looks at it.
**Njepson**: Have them price upstairs and the railing.
**Speaker 3**: Sure.
**Speaker 3**: That's something they can do.
**Speaker 3**: Have they.
**Speaker 3**: Has jail provided a price yet or a quote?
**Adelgado**: No.
**Njepson**: Thanks.
**Njepson**: So.
**Speaker 3**: And then is this an exterior wall?
**Speaker 3**: Because this is a new opening that we're adding?
**Njepson**: No, I.
**Njepson**: I don't think.
**Njepson**: I didn't walk back there, but I don't think it's an exterior wall.
**Njepson**: Maybe it's interior.
**Adelgado**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: You think it's interior too, Andres?
**Adelgado**: It's interior.
**Adelgado**: Well, you could.
**Adelgado**: You could see the.
**Adelgado**: The render.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: To me, that looks exterior, but who knows?
**Speaker 3**: Does the office continue or.
**Njepson**: No, I think it's a room back there.
**Njepson**: Because when you look at the.
**Njepson**: Like on Google Earth, that's not how the exterior is shaped.
**Speaker 3**: Okay.
**Njepson**: It goes straight.
**Njepson**: It doesn't.
**Njepson**: Doesn't turn like that.
**Njepson**: And when you.
**Njepson**: When you walk back there, I would just look at that area.
**Speaker 3**: Okay.
**Speaker 3**: So yeah, here you can see Jared.
**Njepson**: That.
**Speaker 3**: Jared's wall gets demoed here.
**Speaker 3**: Then it comes out.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, that ceiling will probably have to be reworked.
**Speaker 3**: Then there's some sort of fence wall here.
**Speaker 3**: So all this comes out.
**Speaker 3**: Both doors.
**Speaker 3**: Reuse one of them.
**Speaker 3**: Trash those new opening.
**Speaker 3**: Demo the door.
**Speaker 3**: Demo this wall and door.
**Speaker 3**: New door there.
**Speaker 3**: Demo all these cubicles.
**Speaker 3**: Add three new offices.
**Speaker 3**: Door.
**Speaker 3**: Add this wall.
**Speaker 3**: Stairs going up.
**Speaker 3**: Any idea what this new back wall is?
**Speaker 3**: Oh, you'll have to bring it up on the top of the mezzanine.
**Speaker 3**: I wasn't thinking there.
**Speaker 3**: New.
**Adelgado**: New.
**Speaker 3**: So two by four here.
**Speaker 3**: Potentially in Jared's office as well.
**Speaker 3**: Flat, plain ceiling room.
**Speaker 3**: Andres or Nick, you know where this is at 2.
**Speaker 3**: What's that?
**Njepson**: I don't see that note anywhere.
**Adelgado**: It's in the security office.
**Speaker 2**: No.
**Adelgado**: Or no.
**Speaker 3**: No, that's just the room number.
**Adelgado**: Okay.
**Njepson**: That's probably just their standard keynotes.
**Njepson**: And they apply.
**Adelgado**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: Whatever is applicable to the job.
**Speaker 3**: Existing to remain here.
**Speaker 3**: Here you see enough New carp slash existing ceiling term made.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Speaker 3**: Meeting room 5.
**Speaker 3**: Patch.
**Speaker 3**: Ceiling patch and carpet square.
**Speaker 3**: Okay.
**Speaker 3**: So they have that six for here.
**Speaker 3**: They have that patch in ceiling.
**Speaker 3**: That wall.
**Speaker 3**: That wall comes out.
**Speaker 3**: And Jared's.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: And these guys, they.
**Njepson**: They have the drawings.
**Njepson**: So they.
**Njepson**: They should have an idea of what they need to do.
**Njepson**: And I think mostly just going to be bringing.
**Njepson**: Bringing them to the space.
**Njepson**: And yeah, if they have questions, just hey, maybe noting them or you can call me or whatever.
**Speaker 3**: Okay.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: I just wanted to make sure I was a little knowledgeable in this, especially this being our client's headquarters.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 new doors types.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Speaker 3**: Anything else I should know?
**Adelgado**: I don't.
**Njepson**: I don't think so.
**Njepson**: Just letting Andrew know and.
**Speaker 3**: And then do you guys know anything about site access or should I just get that from Andrew as well?
**Njepson**: There's a.
**Njepson**: There's a parking lot there.
**Njepson**: You can park in the parking lot and then call Andrew and he.
**Njepson**: He'll let you in.
**Speaker 3**: All righty.
**Speaker 3**: Sounds good.
**Njepson**: Okay, thanks.
**Adelgado**: Just a last thing from.
**Adelgado**: I have sent to you last email from FBM there asked me something about the openings.
**Adelgado**: Sa.
**Njepson**: Get.
**Njepson**: Get them pre finished and we'll.
**Njepson**: It'll be easier as far as with the painter.
**Njepson**: Brandon, what are you guys working on?
**Njepson**: Andrew's gonna have a site visit with JL and some mechanical guys for Tremont later this week.
**Speaker 2**: All right.
**Speaker 2**: Have Alex go to that.
**Njepson**: Alex?
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, pull Alex into this meeting.
**Speaker 2**: Andres, when you need.
**Speaker 2**: When we need site visit stuff in Indy, we want to try to use a superintendent that's someone that's sitting there like Alex.
**Speaker 2**: So have him go down there and do that.
**Speaker 2**: You know, we don't need to.
**Speaker 2**: To pull into that because Alex is just sitting on his ass in the office.
**Speaker 2**: So pull Alex into this meeting so he knows what's going on because he's going to be the one on the ground anyway.
**Adelgado**: Okay.
**Speaker 2**: You know how to add people to meetings?
**Njepson**: Oh, yeah.
**Speaker 2**: He.
**Njepson**: He's on, right?
**Adelgado**: Okay.
**Adelgado**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: And then Andrew doesn't need to deal with tree mark.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Speaker 2**: So you can take him.
**Speaker 3**: All right.
**Njepson**: All right.
**Njepson**: Okay.
**Njepson**: Alex Treymond.
**Njepson**: Have you.
**Njepson**: Have you seen the drawings at all with that?
**Njepson**: I have not, but I can pull it up, fellas.
**Speaker 2**: Okay, good.
