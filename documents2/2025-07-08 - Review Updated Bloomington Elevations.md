## Transcript
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Hey, everybody.
**Brian.schubert**: Jerome, how we doing?
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Good.
**Brian.schubert**: Good.
**Brian.schubert**: So we're all here standing on our new ramp, But I don't know if Nick was able to give you the message.
**Brian.schubert**: But if we come like a foot above the existing windows that we took out that we blocked in, there's a steel tube that runs above all those openings.
**Brian.schubert**: And then it'll give us a foot.
**Brian.schubert**: A foot space to put the little awnings in.
**Brian.schubert**: Just make them less.
**Brian.schubert**: And then you start the window right there.
**Brian.schubert**: And you can go up 8 foot if you want to.
**Brian.schubert**: And it's all just framing.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Yeah.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Right now, I think I had shown.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Just right now, I took it to the.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: From the top.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: I think it was that.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: That evis band, which I think is three foot, guessing, took it that same height from there.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: So if we can drop down a little bit, especially on the east.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: On the east side where we weren't meeting that number.
**Brian.schubert**: Yep.
**Brian.schubert**: Yeah.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Yeah.
**Brian.schubert**: I would just go a foot and then 8 foot with the window and.
**Brian.schubert**: And then like Andrew was saying, they'd like to leave the.
**Brian.schubert**: The last section next to the canopy as the sign.
**Amulder**: Yeah.
**Brian.schubert**: So the.
**Amulder**: They want the sign on the east elevation to be closer to the canopy.
**Amulder**: So I think on those windows, it's maybe the third or fourth window that we took out from the south side that they'll want that above.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Let me make sure that we're all looking at the same thing here.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: All right.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: So right now.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Yeah, so right now these are six foot windows.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: I just showed that six foot from.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: From there.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: So we can drop.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: We could take that.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Basically that.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: So that line goes straight across.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: And if we come down two feet, that should be eight foot.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Then we would do the same thing here, same thing there.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: And then what were you saying on this area here?
**Brian.schubert**: Can we put the awnings above the windows now or do they need to be down at that lower level like before?
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: We're changing stuff.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: I think it'd be a matter of a.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: You know, as long as they're there, I don't think that they're going to care as much.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: They, you know, they don't have a requirement that I saw that to say that you had to have those within, you know, XP of the storefront.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: So it might look a little.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Might look a little weird having them up high, but it's gonna.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: It's gonna look a little weird otherwise, no matter what.
**Brian.schubert**: Okay.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Yeah.
**Amulder**: And then for that east side, you can just swap the sign for those two windows.
**Brian.schubert**: But that actually cool, because this might fit in between here and Then we'll have three uppers.
**Brian.schubert**: That'll give you the window.
**Amulder**: Yeah, maybe if that works.
**Brian.schubert**: Like if the Goodwill goes all the way to the right and then run up the first three bays with the windows.
**Brian.schubert**: Yeah.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: All right, I'm sorry.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: So you're saying keep this transom here, transom here, transom here, and then just assign there.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Y. Yep.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Yeah, that.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: That might do.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: We would.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: We still keep these, do you think?
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Or maybe have to add one of those in.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: But I'll take a look at the square footage.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: The windows there are a little bit lower, so there is more glass.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: But.
**Brian.schubert**: But then we get to add in our new door opening too.
**Brian.schubert**: Yeah, that's.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Yeah, with.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: I mean, we were with as.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Everything that's shown here, we were still 40 square feet shown are still 40ft short of what was previous.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: That was this.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: This.
**Brian.schubert**: Okay, so that will be good because we're adding 2 in.
**Brian.schubert**: You're adding 1 in.
**Brian.schubert**: But Jesse, you were saying we could go 6 foot or 8 foot high.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: And I think, Jerome, you said these.
**Brian.schubert**: Are six foot high.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: They're currently six foot.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: So, yeah, basically we're going to keep the top of those and drop it down two feet.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: That should get us still that one foot above.
**Brian.schubert**: Well, when I say two feet, like from the.
**Brian.schubert**: The start of the block opening, you need to go up a foot because there's tube steel behind it.
**Brian.schubert**: And then maybe the framing is like on top of that or whatever.
**Brian.schubert**: But you're saying that's three foot currently, that band.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: That was what I.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: That's what I. I think that's what I have that shown as.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: And that's what I took from the.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: I was just counting brick out there, assuming that we had three, three to eight inches.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: And then it looked like a four inch brick in there.
**Brian.schubert**: I got you.
**Brian.schubert**: Okay.
**Brian.schubert**: Yeah.
**Brian.schubert**: Then two foot down into it.
**Brian.schubert**: That works.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Okay.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: And maybe still then having this as needed just to get our square footage countage.
**Brian.schubert**: Yeah, I'd put the.
**Brian.schubert**: The first three with the windows above it and then the goodwill sign and hopefully that gets us what we need.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: We got 10 minutes here.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: So let me get back.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: Get back to my desk, draw this up real quick, send it to the group, and then I'll look.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: If you have any, you know, comments before 11 o', clock, I will get them immediately.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: But let me get this quick.
**Brian.schubert**: All right.
**Brian.schubert**: Awesome.
**Brian.schubert**: Yep.
**Jerome.daksiewicz**: See you guys.
