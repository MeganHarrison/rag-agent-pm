## Transcript

**Brandon Clymer:**
Jesse hey, Jim. 

**Jim Parker:**
Good morning, Jesse. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Morning, Jim. Yeah, I started the meeting in my office. I'm going over to Brandon's office. 

**Jim Parker:**
Okay. Well, it's a fun day. I've got meeting right now and another meeting. It's a. Today's not a fun day. Jesse. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah, Brandon. 

**Jim Parker:**
You look nice today. Hey Brandon, are you using this note taker system? 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah, we use Fireflies. Yep. 

**Jim Parker:**
How do you like that? I've always like reject them off all my calls. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Oh, I. I mean I enjoy it. It's company policy for it to be on every single call. I mean I can't tell you how many times it saved. What do you know? 

**Jim Parker:**
We just. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
What do you not like about it? 

**Jim Parker:**
We don't like the A.I. a. Excuse me? The A.I.A. sorry. A.I. note taking things. I don't know why we're not a fan of it right now. We're just not using them. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
How do you feel about it? 

**Jim Parker:**
I don't know. I mean, I haven't been in the situation where I needed it yet, luckily, but I guess it is a good backup. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah, I mean, you know, just like forever even. Even just weekly meetings with the client, you know, like weekly, you know, touch base OAC meetings, whatever. Just going in and it allows you to speak and be present in the meeting versus working on taking notes all the time to make sure it's accurate. You're present and can speak and then you can go back and watch the recording and you know, look at the action items and then put that into your meeting notes and then send them out and it's way more accurate. 

**Jim Parker:**
Yeah, I agree. I think it's neat. We should be doing it better. But like right now I'm sitting on a call with 45 people and I can't even imagine a picking up everybody's voice and everything on this call when. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
It doesn't have to. Right. Like if you're on a call and I mean it'll pick up everybody's stuff if they're all, you know, remoted in separately. Yeah, but if it's in a big room meeting, then it won't pick it up. But that's when you go back to the recording and again you look and confirm. And even if you do take notes and you're like, I can't remember what this was. You go back and listen to whatever and confirm what it is. 

**Jim Parker:**
Well, that's a good way of using a tool for sure. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
I mean I. I even go into like when we walk on site and like if a client's walking with the superintendent or PM or whoever, you know, I like, you can a, have the Fireflies app and you can just record right then and there or at the very least, like, I will, you know, like, hey, go in there, do voice memo, put it in your breast pocket and record the entire thing. And then you can take that, that voice recording, drop it into GBT chat gbt and it'll give you proper notes. But that way you know, when you're walking on site and there's a request, blah, blah, blah, hey, here's what happened, you know, and it's recorded. 

**Jim Parker:**
So that's, that is definitely legit for the amount of job walks y' all do and the amount of like unforeseen scope that they probably tell you about that is different than what's on the documents. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yep. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Hey, can we do this? Okay, great. Like, sure. Obviously we can. I'll get you pricing on that. And it's all recorded. Hey, per a walk today, you requested these items. 

**Jim Parker:**
Yeah, that's, that's cool. All right, sorry, I was just wondering since we have an additional person on the call with us, what do you use? Af. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
And the best thing too is like, you know, so I, you know, we have a company one, but then I have my own, Jesse has his own. And so, you know, if I don't, if I don't make it into meetings, my note taker will go for me and I can go back and watch a recording. 

**Jim Parker:**
Oh, wow, that's cool. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
And so like, so for me, right, So I, you know, Jesse asked me to stop going to the, to the weekly ops meetings because I get two in the weeds and everything. But I still like to know what's going on. And so I will watch the recording after. 

**Jim Parker:**
That's cool. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
So, yeah. All right, so basically what we wanted. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
To do was kind of go over. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Know, a little bit high level stuff with you as far as, you know, what are. 

**Jim Parker:**
Hey, Jesse, we just lost Brandon. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
So sorry about that. I wanted to go over what our goals were, you know, and kind of set some, some high level expectations. 

**Jim Parker:**
Perfect. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
So, you know, the biggest thing is about like our culture and what we do. And so it's a little bit different, which I think is attributed to our success. You know, we have a few things so we, we have what's called an ownership mindset. So every single project we look at, we always look at it through the views of the owner and say, all right, what is it going to take to make this project and therefore this business successful and profitable? Because, just because we do well, and, you know, we make our number, this, that and the other. But if we put together a shitty design or we do shitty work or whatever and the client is not successful in their business, then that's a fail. Like we succeed when they succeed. And that's the mindset that we ingrain in every single person to be like, no, we, we truly are a team. This is not an adversarial relationship. 

**Jim Parker:**
Yeah. You're looking for a repeat client. You're not looking for a home run every time you go to bat. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Correct. And even if it's not a repeat client, Right. Like if this is just a one, one project we do with somebody, then the standard is we're going to treat them the same as somebody who we do 30 projects with. Right. We're going to approach it the same way, do the same systems and deliver the absolute best product there is. 

**Jim Parker:**
Yeah, no problem. I agree completely with that. I got it. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
So we have this thing called Can I C A N I? Constant and never ending improvement. And so continually working on, like, what can we get better at today? Like, I try to instill in these guys, what is one thing that you can improve on today? Because at the end of the day, if you're not trying to get better at your craft, then what are you doing? Right. Even if you don't want to work here forever, you want to become the best you can do. So you go off. And whether you start your own business, you work for somebody else, you want to be the best that you can possibly be and take pride in your work. Yeah. So those are kind of some of the higher levels, you know, just mindset stuff. You know. One thing we harp on, we have a saying here called be urgent early. So we're constantly talking to the guys like, hey, don't sit on this, get on it now. There's no reason to sit in your court. Get on it now. Because control the things you can control now so that later when things are outside of your control, it's not all bunched up, you've got some time to work with. 

**Jim Parker:**
That's a great motto. Hopefully your teams instill those qualities because those are hard to get this younger age group to understand that. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah, it is. But again, it's, it's, it's, it's continual going over it. Like in that, that saying, you know, I kind of just came up with, it's easy to roll off the tongue, hey, be urgent early constantly. And you'll hear the guys say that. Be urgent early, like constantly. You know, reiterating that it's a mindset. So those are some of the kind of the core company values and everything. And I wanted to make sure that you understood, you know, what we want and what our position is on culture. 

**Jim Parker:**
Yeah, got it. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
So then, so the other thing, so we know that one of our weak points is estimating. 

**Jim Parker:**
And so, so if you could get me the cities that you got these jobs coming up in and I'll poke at my estimators at alleatogroup and I'll get call to us and everything for contractors that we need, like Fort Myers, we had a 250 million dollar job we were supposed to do that got canned. But we got to call us for that project that I can give us. So we already have that. I've got a 180 million dollar job about to go in Savannah. I can get the call list for the subcontractors for that. That's already built in, that's already approved. That's qualified to do a job of this nature. Not trunk slammers that sometimes you see in your world. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Who'S going to make the calls on that call list. 

**Jim Parker:**
So what happens on that is we'll throw it into. Do y' all use Building Connect or what's your estimating software y' all use? 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Plan Hub is what we have right now. 

**Jim Parker:**
Plan Hub, y' all loads contractors into Plan Hub. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah, or we've used Building Connected as well. Right, but, but, but listen to my question. I understand what you're going to say. Upload the list in there, send out the invites and then my next question to you is going to say, well, well, who's going to upload the list and send out the invites? 

**Jim Parker:**
Right. So you're wanting an estimator. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Correct. And so when you meant, you mentioned in the Tampa. You guys have a Tampa office now and you have the estimating team in there. I don't know if that's one or 10 people is not happy for whatever reason. And so reaching out to them, you know, hey, who are these people right in that office that are good that we want to try and get to come over? 

**Jim Parker:**
Yeah. Okay. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Because that's the thing, like we can, you know, doing all this stuff, the contractor list, you know, finding qualified subs and everything. Obviously we know how to do that. It's. Somebody has to do that. 

**Jim Parker:**
Yeah, I agree completely. But the thing is that is a process and we have to. It takes a little bit of time to get that squared up. You know, that's a month away from getting an estimator on board at Least Right. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Which is why it's one of the first things to cover because we have to. We have to get working on that because we know it doesn't happen in a day. 

**Jim Parker:**
Cool. And then I also have basically a subcontractor estimator that I think would fit nicely to help you with your fire sprinkler estimating. Basically. He's very good in the details and the weeds and he just needs to be taught what to take off and then he can go gangbusters at it. Take that. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Is he already in the sprinkler space? 

**Jim Parker:**
No, he's not in the sprinkler space. So he will be new that we'll have to teach him. But he is very detailed oriented and he's, you know, used to doing long hand takeoffs and everything else that would need to be done for your sprinkler. Or I can reach out to sprinkler contractors and find an estimator from there. I've got someone in the Fort Myers area right now that we used before. That was with Shambaugh. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah. What we, what we want to look at specifically like, so like getting somebody to do takeoff and stuff is okay, but really what we need is, you know, or what you know, I lack is somebody who is what's like called a nicest four. And so that means that they can, they can stamp sprinkler drawings. And so if we had somebody who had that nicest for even if they didn't necessarily stamp them, but they could do auto spring and they could do the HLF files. Those are the things that I can't do that I have to rely on outside help for which isn't always timely and is a hang up on this because once we have to do that. 

**Jim Parker:**
What takes me when it's cold and I'll start looking around people I know. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Okay. 

**Jim Parker:**
So I'll start looking. I've got one of my buddies, he's a big sprinkler contractor, but he's. He's 70, so he's getting ready to retire. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah. 

**Jim Parker:**
Be something he might want to do part time or something. But I'll reach out to see who he was using for that kind of stuff too. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Okay. And then you want to go over your operations stuff. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
And you know, right now we got Jesse basically and myself as the two people that are really in like senior PM roles. And like when you come on board, if we can split it up, you know, we have five PMs. We got Glenn, which Jesse's already. Well, Jesse's Already working with all of them. But he's. There's. Glenn, there's. And then Keva. We were thinking of having those two guys kind of stay under Jesse to manage and, you know, kind of look at what they're doing. They have. Kevin's wrapping up with some of these Avon Radio project. Radio projects. But then he's got a Uniqlo, it's a big sprinkler job. And then Glenn has Westfield Collective, and then he's wrapping up couple small goodwill jobs. And. And then we got AJ and we got Nick, and we got Alec. And so Nick's got several goodwill projects and a couple other projects he's working on. Alec has got a pretty good sized sprinkler project he's working on. And then he's helping estimate on two projects, three projects that he's working on. And then AJ's, you know, he's got probably four or five projects there in Indy that he's running as the PM. So we were gonna, you know, but as we grow and we can get another Senior PM and those people on board, you know, then we'll be able to kind of more make that organization tree. But for now, we like you to kind of take the lead of looking at those two pms and projects they're doing or three pms, and then Jesse focus on his. And then. 

**Jim Parker:**
Okay, can you send me their names and contact information and what they're in charge of so I can get. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah. 

**Jim Parker:**
Kind of feel what they're doing. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah. Basically, as we. As we grow, you know, so we know that we can't have Jesse be the only Jesse R. Be the only senior pm and everybody just report to him, and then Jesse R. Reports to you, and then you report to Jesse D. Like that. It's just too linear. Right. That doesn't make sense. And so being able to split it to where Jesse R. Is over a few and you're over a few, that way you can actually get more into the details of the projects and actually provide stronger guidance. Because that's, you know, I think Jesse told you, like, not having, like, we don't have those, you know, a players that like, you like. Okay, got this, blah, blah. Okay. Don't forget this. Good to go. Right. With a daily check in. 

**Jim Parker:**
Yeah, that's a good idea. And then y' all are wanting another Senior pm. Brandon. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
I mean, probably a pm, I would say, is our first priority right now. I mean, eventually, yeah, we'll need one, but right now, I mean, we can just. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
A good pm. Yes, it's Almost. It's not almost. It's just like we have four APMs and one almost PM currently. So hiring a good PM that you know, then these guys really, he could manage one big job or several multiple of these other jobs and actually he'd be almost in the role of a senior pm. But you know, well, I mean it's just below him would be. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
We want to get more guys like that that are running, you know, projects because right now we've got just too many. I mean one of our PMs were literally going in two weeks demote him to an 8pm because he's clearly not there. And so we want to get some actual, you know, rising star PMs or at least a you know, a guy who's knows what he's doing. You know. Versus right now we are top heavy in all of our talent. You know, it's me and him, Jesse R. And you all know what we're doing. But we don't have anybody lower that does. 

**Jim Parker:**
Well no, you have lower than us. You just don't have in the middle. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
No, I said lower. That does know what they're doing. 

**Jim Parker:**
Right? Yeah. Okay, got it. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
And that's what, that's what we need. Yeah. 

**Jim Parker:**
Another. Another PM type. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Correct. Yeah, that would be ideal, you know because we've got a couple like we got like a up in indie, you know, eight million dollar ground up that'll come up. I mean we've got, you know, several of these GoodWills that'll be 10, 12 million in work. Like you know, guys that can run those types of jobs because you know those are, those are good base hits to do. 

**Jim Parker:**
Yeah. Okay. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
And then obviously the bigger stuff, that's where you're going to get more seasoned, you know, higher up guys. 

**Jim Parker:**
Right. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
PSRs. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah. Looking at, you know, the PSR and once you get your computer and we find a time today I know we had the. Your afternoon's pretty jammed but maybe it's even tomorrow. I can show you the monthly reporting we do so you can take a look at that offer your. 

**Jim Parker:**
Yeah, I'm pretty wide open tomorrow. Today's been a day. I don't know what everybody off of a Labor Day just decided to have meetings and just stack them. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yep. Yes. Tomorrow we'll get a time that works. We'll go over that also looking at all the current jobs we've got going. Get you the list of everyone's name, which jobs are running and then we just going over everything that should be starting into this year. First part of Next year. And then kind of looking at what those jobs are, their scopes, and kind of looking at the guys we got, you know, knowing we needed true pm, we'd like to hire one for Indianapolis, and. And then just kind of do our allocation of the manpower. How are we going to cover these jobs coming up? Maybe we need two PMs in Indianapolis. I don't know. So just want to review. 

**Jim Parker:**
Staffing chart for future jobs, right? 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah, yeah. And superintendents too. I mean. 

**Jim Parker:**
Yeah. When they start. Okay. Do y' all have a spreadsheet y' all track or how do y' all. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Do that as far as who's on what jobs? 

**Jim Parker:**
Yeah. So we have a. I have a basic spreadsheet that I track all my projects with all the people I have. And then I also have all my future projects coming up. And then I have all kind of just random ass metrics on them on that spreadsheet, if you want to see it. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah, we can look at that. We could probably just add it to notion. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah, that'd be good. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
But yeah, superintendents as well. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yep. A strong superintendent. We don't have no one near like a senior super level person here. I mean, we're struggling really. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
We've got maybe one super in Chad. Then, you know, the other ones are probably assistants. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah. 

**Jim Parker:**
Okay. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Does Leighton has a Chicago office, right? 

**Jim Parker:**
No. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Okay. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Just a Nashville. 

**Jim Parker:**
Yeah. Our. One of our sister companies has a Chicago office, but not us. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah. I'd like to see your chart, Nate or Jim, because that would. I'd happen to create something, just plug the people in, be pretty. That would make it pretty easy. I could fill it all in for it and send it to you. 

**Jim Parker:**
Yeah, we're. We're using new called Bridget Bench and all this other crap, but it all works the same as a spreadsheet. It's just fancier. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Ever heard of Bridge Advance? 

**Jim Parker:**
Is that Bridget Bench? It's a. Basically you put every employee you have and then you fill out what they're doing and all this other crap and it's a bunch of matrixes and it's, you know, their evaluations and their salary and it's. It's wild what's all in that system. But we can search where people are from and yada, yada, yada to see, you know, where we should send them next. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah, I guess when you had a thousand people. Makes sense. 

**Jim Parker:**
Yeah. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
What would you say, like, percentage of your people travel? Is it almost all other than the office. 

**Jim Parker:**
Support, all of them, except for senior PM staff and above. But I Still have those guys that travel too, but. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah, they're just. You're saying. You're saying that the senior PM staff just travel to a site visit, but the other staff are more relocating, correct? To a job. 

**Jim Parker:**
Yeah, they're relocated, but some of my senior level staff are on jobs. But those jobs have to be substantial, you know, 200 plus million. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Right. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Makes sense. Yeah. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Okay. What? What? 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Do you have any questions or anything for us? 

**Jim Parker:**
No. I'll send you all that spreadsheet. Basically, the hottest thing on the list is you want an estimator now. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah. 

**Jim Parker:**
Text on us as a pm and then basically you'll have me manage a couple of PMs and some jobs to oversee them to make sure they're clicking. Right? Correct. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Correct. Yeah. And it's. I think it's. It'll be very valuable too, just to be closer to those jobs so you can see some of the systems and how things go. And then that way you're more educated on the current operation and therefore can make an educated assessment of something that might need changed. 

**Jim Parker:**
Yeah, no problem. Yeah, that's what I was wanting. I wasn't wanting to check submittals or do RFIs or anything, but. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah, no, no, it's. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
This is more. Again, that's we now it's more, you know, obviously holding those guys accountable to do that stuff. But I would not expect. Again, I don't think Jesse Artis middles, does he? 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah, no. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Now, again, they may ask you questions and you may teach them, which I would expect you to do. 

**Jim Parker:**
No, no. Yeah, that's fine. I'm just messing with y'. All. I'm just joking. So when I started at Leighton, I was. I got put on some job or whatever. The project manager wasn't cutting it, so I did all the RFIs submittals, wrote all the contracts, bought the whole job out and learned their software real quick that way. But this way will definitely be an easier path for me. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah, and that'll be good too, because with, you know, like for instance, Nick being underneath him, Noblesville just now starting our design phase, he'll be able to see the, you know, for entire beginning of it. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yep. Yeah. Because that like the goodwill work is just like clockwork now, really. It's just continually stuff that's going to come in well. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
And I mean, again, I'm making a hard press for the nation, so. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah. Jim, did I tell you about these Excel centers? 

**Jim Parker:**
No. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
So they're a store or. Sorry, they're in school for charter school. Charter school for like People that flunked out of high school or dropped out or didn't get their ged and they started. They were the original ones, I think, in the U.S. indiana and Indiana. Now, like the rest of the country, Goodwills are like wanting to get involved in this. And so Brandon's got a great relationship with the CEO of the Goodwill Indiana. They actually, you know, we went to an event where they hope it was a grand opening for the last one we did for him. And he's putting him in contact with. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
I cornered him. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah, he's put Brandon in contact with, you know, other, you know, state. I didn't realize it, but Goodwill or each by state or even some states have separate goodwill organizations in them territories. So they just. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
So, yeah, there's multiple different territories of different goodwills. Like the one that, you know, we. That he's referring to is Goodwill of Central and Southern Indiana. And they just took Central Illinois over as well. And so they also started this Excel Center. So as. As other goodwill territories want to do excels, they typically reach out because they are the de facto national director. And so what I did was I said, wouldn't it be great if everybody followed your exact criteria around the country so it was uniform? And he's like, yeah, how would we do that? I was like, let me show you. So, yeah, it's good work. 

**Jim Parker:**
Cool. Well, that's pretty exciting. That is definitely exciting. How big are the jobs? Just like a couple hundred thousand or a couple million or two. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Two and a half between two. If it's. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
If it's a. If it's a ti. It's two, two and a half A ground up is going to be, you know, four or five. 

**Jim Parker:**
Cool. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
So. 

**Jim Parker:**
Okay. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
No, let's see here. Oh, that's it. You send me that spreadsheet, Jim. I'll get it filled out. 

**Jim Parker:**
Yeah, I'll send you the spreadsheet and then I'll start hunting around on this estimator and a project manager for y' all, too. And then what else? But you'll have all the updated list and everything for tomorrow, Jesse. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah, Yep. I'll get it done and sent back to you. And then your computer tracking on it shows like 10:30 place. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah, it should be there any minute. 

**Jim Parker:**
29 minutes from that. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yep. Yeah. It was a rough weekend in football for you, Jim. Clemson went down, Alabama went down. 

**Jim Parker:**
It's kind of like you do every day, Jesse. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
That's it. For the last 20 years, it's been my world. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
The rest is probably ranked after that stellar win. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
I Think they actually are. Yeah, but good for you. Luckily for you, Alabama, they went up in the polls. 

**Jim Parker:**
It's so. The comical thing is they or whatever. Whatever his name is, he's lost to four unranked teams and saving. Lost to four. In his whole time in Alabama. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
I've seen that Saban did. Went through 260 some games and only lost four unranked. This guy's coach. 14 games, he still lost four. 

**Jim Parker:**
Yeah, I don't know. I'd like to get fired and paid $60 million that they bought out. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
That's what it is. Holy. 

**Jim Parker:**
That's crazy. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Don't get any ideas with your employment contract, Jim. 

**Jim Parker:**
Yeah, we'll need a bow cloth. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Oh, give me 160 million. Jesus, that's. I mean, that's a hell of a goddamn. So basically had what a. 

**Jim Parker:**
Well, Jimbo Fisher had the same deal. I mean, they bought him out at like 70 million at a m. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Geez, Louis, sit and collect. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah, it's crazy. 

**Jim Parker:**
All right, Jesse, I'll send you that stuff right now. Is there anything else y' all need for me? I'm gonna start pushing around on Chris to see if I can talk him into it. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Yeah, that's kind of the main thing. Yeah. And if you've got. I mean, let us know, I guess. Chris is the estimator out of Tampa. Is there only one or there other ones or. 

**Jim Parker:**
Well, he's not in Tampa. He's out of. Where is he out of? He's out of. Delray beach is where he lives. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
So he'll be on the East Coast. 

**Jim Parker:**
Yeah, it's on the east coast. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
So is there. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Is there anybody in the Tampa office or. 

**Jim Parker:**
No, no, there's not. We don't have. We have staff in Tampa. We have one girl in Tampa that does estimating, but she's very junior level. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Is she any good? 

**Jim Parker:**
It's to be determined. She's very. I mean, she's two years in the industry. They're still very young. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Gotcha. Is the guy said, is he only going to live in Delray or would he move to Tampa? 

**Jim Parker:**
He's pretty dead set on that. But with him being remote, it's actually more beneficial for estimating because then nobody with him and he's able to grind the shit out of it. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Gotcha. 

**Jim Parker:**
So. But that's what he's doing for us right now. He's, you know, he's working on shit tons of projects at once and then I'll call my fire sprinkler buddy too this morning. 

**Brandon Clymer:**
Okay, cool. Thanks. 

**Jim Parker:**
Cool. Thanks, guys. See you.
