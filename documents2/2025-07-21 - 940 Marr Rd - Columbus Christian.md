## Transcript
**Bclymer**: Hoosier national, right?
**Kwildey**: Yes.
**Kwildey**: No, east.
**Bclymer**: East.
**Kwildey**: Yeah.
**Kwildey**: But we got a while to go before we get there, so.
**Kwildey**: Right, yeah.
**Kwildey**: It's growing north.
**Kwildey**: We got factories going up, going north, residential east and west, a couple factories south.
**Kwildey**: Like it's.
**Kwildey**: Yeah, it's moving.
**Kwildey**: How about you guys?
**Kwildey**: Same.
**Kwildey**: Busy growing man.
**Jared**: Oh, yeah, yeah.
**Jared**: Jared, this is our coo, Jesse Dawson.
**Jared**: I don't know if you've met Jared.
**Jdawson**: How you doing?
**Kwildey**: All right.
**Jared**: Jesse said Jared worked with us on a few jobs.
**Jared**: He used to work at Dean Electrical.
**Jared**: So we worked on a few.
**Jared**: Few jobs.
**Jared**: And then he got smart and went into real estate.
**Jared**: Nice.
**Jdawson**: You turned it all over to Brandon.
**Speaker 4**: Over there or Brennan.
**Kwildey**: Sorry.
**Kwildey**: Yeah.
**Jared**: So is.
**Jared**: Is the client jumping on this chair?
**Jared**: Do you know?
**Kwildey**: I haven't talked to him this morning, but I assume so.
**Kwildey**: Some more leskies.
**Kwildey**: He's got a school, Columbus Christian School.
**Kwildey**: It's like two blocks down the road south on Mar.
**Kwildey**: And their total student has written.
**Kwildey**: There he is.
**Kwildey**: I'll let him talk.
**Kwildey**: But they.
**Kwildey**: Hey, Kendall, can you hear me?
**Speaker 4**: I can.
**Speaker 4**: Good morning, everybody.
**Kwildey**: Good morning.
**Kwildey**: Good.
**Kwildey**: Hey, I was just talking about your good problem you got there.
**Speaker 4**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Students, they have.
**Kwildey**: It's risen from a couple hundred, like five, six years ago, and they're hitting over 500.
**Kwildey**: And basically they're looking for some additional space, additional classroom space for the next three to five years while they save up some additional funds to expand their school permanently and wanting to figure out how to use that Mar Road space to do so.
**Kwildey**: It's good for them.
**Kwildey**: It's super close.
**Kwildey**: I showed him the Goodwill space that you guys did and how it can be made into a school, and he liked the layout and liked how it looked, so we just kind of wanted to.
**Kwildey**: I'll let him talk from here and tell what all he needs.
**Kwildey**: But we liked how it looked.
**Kwildey**: Wanted to talk to you guys about getting a layout and getting kind of a.
**Kwildey**: How much is it going to cost, honestly?
**Kwildey**: Like, where we at the ballpark?
**Jared**: Yep.
**Kwildey**: Kendall, I'll let you add, like, what you're looking to do.
**Kwildey**: How much?
**Speaker 4**: Yeah, yeah.
**Speaker 4**: So.
**Speaker 4**: And for one, you know, this probably is more on your end, Jared, before the owner.
**Speaker 4**: You know, we are looking long term because we just did this $3.2 million wing addition that we just did.
**Speaker 4**: So we're in the.
**Speaker 4**: We're in the middle of that.
**Speaker 4**: Have probably paid over half of that off.
**Speaker 4**: But to go back to our people right now and ask for another building addition, it's probably not going to happen for a few years.
**Speaker 4**: So this long term leasing is, we think, is a better option for us.
**Speaker 4**: For now, we, we have some options we could look at.
**Speaker 4**: I mean, we, we could do, we could do space for just our 9th through 12th graders and just move our high school kids.
**Speaker 4**: We could probably do a 7 through 12, or we could do more like an early learning center and do more of a kindergarten through second grade and move younger grades in an area as well.
**Speaker 4**: Our initial thoughts were probably at least our high school because it's easier to maneuver those older kids.
**Speaker 4**: And I think just the idea of moving, you know, everybody's so excited about school and those young, younger years, you know, to move them from our site might not be the best, the best look for our people, I don't know.
**Speaker 4**: But we're open to any of that.
**Speaker 4**: So right now, our classrooms that we have in the two different wings, the wing that was built in 1999, those classrooms are about 750 square feet.
**Speaker 4**: The new wing that we just built, the classrooms in that wing are about 900 square feet.
**Speaker 4**: So our secondary numbers per class are lower than our elementary.
**Speaker 4**: So I think as long as we're in that 750 to 900 square foot range for a classroom, we'd be in good shape.
**Speaker 4**: And how many we need would depend on, again, whether we would decide.
**Speaker 4**: And a lot of our decision obviously would be cost.
**Speaker 4**: But whether we would decide to move the full seven through 12 or just nine through 12.
**Speaker 4**: Nine through 12, we'd probably be looking at a minimum of like six rooms.
**Speaker 4**: And we like that.
**Speaker 4**: The big open space that you had kind of a congregate eating stables and chairs in the Excel area.
**Speaker 4**: We like that obviously the receptionist and office areas, restrooms.
**Speaker 4**: I mean, we really like the look of what you did with the Excel group.
**Speaker 4**: So those are just some of our initial thoughts.
**Jared**: So with that, so you want, you know, 750 to 900 square feet.
**Jared**: Now, the classrooms that we did for the Goodwill space, those are about 500 to 600 is kind of the biggest one.
**Jared**: So you're going to want a little bit larger than that.
**Jared**: Correct.
**Speaker 4**: Okay.
**Speaker 4**: So in looking at that, when Jared showed us around, we thought those, what you did there, we thought would work.
**Speaker 4**: Okay, I'd hate to go smaller than that, but I do think those would work.
**Speaker 4**: I was saying it.
**Speaker 4**: I'm just.
**Speaker 4**: And I don't.
**Speaker 4**: Do you guys work?
**Speaker 4**: I was thinking those might be around 7, 7, 5, but whatever they are because we, we counted like how many tables and chairs spaces they had and with what they had set up in Those rooms that would be big enough for the size of high school classrooms.
**Speaker 4**: We have middle school.
**Speaker 4**: If we go middle school, our middle school numbers are a lot higher than our high school numbers.
**Jared**: Now, when you do high school, are those, those kids are all driving, correct?
**Speaker 4**: Not necessarily.
**Speaker 4**: Some of the freshmen and sophomores, they don't have their license yet.
**Jared**: Okay, and so how many, if you did, let's say you just did, you did the high school, how many students would you project to have in there?
**Speaker 4**: Yeah, so let me count them real quick in my mind.
**Speaker 4**: So we currently have in our high school enrollment just 9 to 12, just over 60, probably in the 60, 65 range.
**Speaker 4**: So I would say if we'd plan for, you know, around 80ish or so with a little growth over those years.
**Jared**: Is that, call it 20, 20 per grade.
**Speaker 4**: The younger one, the, our senior class this year is our last kind of small class class from all this growth that we've had.
**Speaker 4**: So like they're only.
**Speaker 4**: Well, and we won't have it for this next year.
**Speaker 4**: So.
**Speaker 4**: Yeah, looking, looking, looking going forward, the average is going to be in that 18 to 20 range per grade level.
**Jared**: Okay, so you're going to need, you know, call it 40 spots and then call it 10 more for staff.
**Jared**: So you're going to need 50 parking spots.
**Jared**: If you did that roughly.
**Speaker 4**: Okay, okay.
**Speaker 4**: Yeah, but we, yeah, we won't have probably at least half of those students won't be drivers.
**Jared**: Well, if you have 80, I'm saying freshman, sophomore, don't drive, junior and senior do.
**Speaker 4**: So that'd be 40.
**Speaker 4**: Okay, gotcha.
**Speaker 4**: Gotcha.
**Speaker 4**: Yes, sir.
**Jared**: Yeah, so, and, and even if they're not, you know, the, the, the city doesn't care.
**Jared**: They're going to base it off of code, so they're going to say X number of spots.
**Speaker 4**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Kendall, how does your high school work?
**Bclymer**: So I went to Covenant Christian, so a little bit bigger class size, but still, still kind of that small classical Christian education type thing.
**Bclymer**: Are you guys sticking, you know, you having teachers teach multiple different grades or multiple different class types or like how many classrooms would you be looking for for high school?
**Bclymer**: Because I know there's different subjects and all.
**Speaker 4**: Yeah.
**Speaker 4**: So probably very familiar with what you're used to.
**Speaker 4**: AJ so you know Andy Goodwin then, huh?
**Bclymer**: Oh, yeah, I know him really well.
**Speaker 4**: He's a good guy.
**Jared**: Yeah.
**Speaker 4**: So, yeah, you know, we, we do, I mean, we do a block, we do a block schedule.
**Speaker 4**: So all the kids have four classes.
**Speaker 4**: You know, we have like blue and Red day, so they have four classes.
**Speaker 4**: On a blue day, four classes.
**Speaker 4**: On a red day, a lot of the younger ones, as they're coming in, like freshman algebra, then, you know, those 20 are probably going to be in that class.
**Speaker 4**: There might be a few that would branch off to a geometry or something, but then obviously.
**Speaker 4**: Go ahead.
**Bclymer**: Oh, I was just agreeing.
**Jared**: I was.
**Speaker 4**: Okay.
**Speaker 4**: Yeah.
**Speaker 4**: Yeah.
**Speaker 4**: And then as.
**Speaker 4**: As they get older, you know, and there's more electives and things, it kind of.
**Speaker 4**: It kind of breaks off to, you know, how many is going to be in a chemistry or a physics class or something like that?
**Speaker 4**: Because they all don't take those.
**Speaker 4**: So that's why I think we would need probably at least six classes, maybe up to eight, because we could just go like, here's a.
**Speaker 4**: Here's a class for the freshmen, and here's a class for the sophomores because they're going to break off.
**Speaker 4**: And this.
**Speaker 4**: This group.
**Speaker 4**: And of course, we have Bible, too.
**Speaker 4**: So this group's going to, you know, be in Bible class.
**Speaker 4**: And this one might be in a fine arts class where, you know, the freshman might be one.
**Speaker 4**: So I'd say six to eight classrooms, depending on how much square footage we're looking at.
**Jdawson**: Have they given you an idea of where in this building you'd be getting a space?
**Jdawson**: And, like, do you want windows in all classrooms?
**Jdawson**: Or, like.
**Jdawson**: Have you thought about any of that yet?
**Speaker 4**: So we.
**Speaker 4**: We looked at the entire facility.
**Speaker 4**: It was.
**Speaker 4**: It was easy for me to quickly get lost in there.
**Jared**: Yeah.
**Speaker 4**: And where I was.
**Speaker 4**: But.
**Speaker 4**: But I know Excel's got that, like C and part of the B.
**Speaker 4**: So we kind of were focusing more on A and how much space we might need in A. I think it doesn't.
**Speaker 4**: Is.
**Speaker 4**: Except.
**Kwildey**: Split it up.
**Kwildey**: A, B and C tenants.
**Jared**: What'd you say, Jared?
**Kwildey**: Do you have the breakdown?
**Kwildey**: We split it up between A, B and C tenants.
**Jared**: I don't have that.
**Jared**: Did you send that?
**Kwildey**: No, I just didn't know he was talking about A, B and C. And we have it kind of in our offering memorandum.
**Kwildey**: It's split up.
**Kwildey**: So let me find that and send that out real quick.
**Jared**: I would say this is, you know, this is going to be your A right here.
**Kwildey**: That wherever.
**Jared**: So Excel is down here.
**Kwildey**: So Excel was like the C area for us.
**Jared**: Yeah.
**Jared**: So I would say just by looking at this.
**Jared**: Right.
**Jared**: Because the client or the.
**Jared**: I should say the landlord is going to want to break this up to where they can still have frontage.
**Jared**: Right.
**Jared**: So this is going to be one, Excel is two.
**Jared**: And then you have another entrance here.
**Jared**: So this is going to be your third area.
**Jared**: You know, if I, if I'm a landlord, I, you know.
**Kwildey**: Yeah, we're looking at the main entrance and then I guess that would be.
**Jared**: Plan north here.
**Kwildey**: Yeah.
**Kwildey**: Yes.
**Speaker 4**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And yes.
**Jdawson**: I heard some discussion about trying to use.
**Jdawson**: Is that on the lower level there's almost like a gym.
**Jdawson**: It's got a super tall ceiling in it.
**Jdawson**: Were you trying to use.
**Jdawson**: Incorporate that into something or you want to stay on the.
**Jdawson**: This main level?
**Speaker 4**: Well, well, I don't know.
**Speaker 4**: We're open to using the lower level.
**Speaker 4**: I mean, we, we have different levels and that, that would not be a problem, especially if, you know, we might even be able to use the downstairs for like, you know, guidance office space or, you know, nurse or, you know, things like that as well.
**Speaker 4**: As long as you keep that golf simulator space.
**Speaker 4**: So I can go in there and play golf?
**Speaker 4**: It doesn't.
**Speaker 4**: But no, but we're also not opposed.
**Speaker 4**: Like if you're coming into suite A there and we stay to the left of where the downstairs wouldn't come into play, I mean, we're open.
**Speaker 4**: We don't have to have the basement.
**Kwildey**: Is there any requirement for tornado filtering?
**Speaker 4**: Go ahead.
**Kwildey**: Is there any requirement for tornado sheltering for Indiana?
**Kwildey**: Like, is that for school?
**Speaker 4**: There's not a requirement.
**Speaker 4**: We just have to come up with and present a plan of, you know, what is the best safety procedures with whatever facility you're working with.
**Kwildey**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And I just said that because there's one elevator there.
**Jdawson**: If you did use the lower section, then you would have to.
**Jdawson**: I think it's down there.
**Jdawson**: You can see it's X'd out in that corridor on the lower right there.
**Speaker 4**: So.
**Jared**: Right.
**Speaker 4**: Yeah.
**Speaker 4**: At least six.
**Speaker 4**: Yeah.
**Jared**: So I just kind of laid out six classrooms here.
**Jared**: Just rough squares here.
**Jared**: You know, you want to line this on the outside, you know, and then obviously this one's the issue because you don't have.
**Jared**: You're not gonna have any outside glass.
**Jared**: So you may have to move something to up here.
**Jared**: And then you have your open space.
**Jared**: And then maybe this corner is offices.
**Jared**: And then your second form of egress would be you'd have a hallway right here that takes you outside.
**Jared**: And so that would be your exterior rear entrance.
**Jared**: Something along those lines.
**Jared**: Right.
**Jared**: Like you may bump these down and have an egress over here.
**Jared**: But, you know, if we can, we'll adjust.
**Jared**: You'd want to adjust the sizes to try to keep some of this, you know, you know, these bathrooms and stuff to where we're not Messing with those.
**Jared**: This one's probably gonna have to go no matter what.
**Jared**: Same with this one, just because they're in the middle of it.
**Speaker 4**: And then you'd have your.
**Jared**: Your entrance and probably like, I don't know how many staff you're going to have, but this is where you would have, you know, guidance counselor offices, things like that.
**Jared**: And then you could have a big student area, kind of like what you were talking about in the center here.
**Jared**: And then you'll have again, whatever ancillary, you know, staff, break room.
**Jared**: All that kind of stuff would be, I would say, up here, away from everything.
**Jared**: And then you kind of have a nice open concept here.
**Jared**: Maybe, you know, you have put the rest corner.
**Jared**: Yeah.
**Jared**: And you maybe have a bank of guidance counselor offices or whatever it is that's here, you know, so it's in the student area as well.
**Jared**: And then you've already got plumbing here, so you could, you know, you could put your.
**Jared**: Your bank of restrooms down here to where you're tying into this plumbing.
**Jared**: Something along those lines, assuming you took home there.
**Jared**: Now, obviously we would want to do an actual space plan, but I just wanted to kind of.
**Speaker 4**: Yeah.
**Jared**: Initial thoughts.
**Jared**: That's what I would kind of look at because that gives you a.
**Jared**: A good flow to get in here.
**Jared**: You probably want to redo this entrance here to make it a double door.
**Jared**: I don't have a.
**Jared**: A, probably a vestibule so that people come in and you have, you know, somebody has to maybe buzz them in or something like that to get into the school.
**Speaker 4**: Absolutely.
**Jared**: But yeah, I mean, something similar to that is probably what you'd look at.
**Jared**: Again, we might adjust the squares and everything, depending on what we need to work with.
**Jared**: But again, that gives you your six classrooms.
**Jared**: And then do you know what kind of budget you're working with on something like this?
**Jared**: What is your.
**Jared**: I mean, number that we back into for design and build?
**Speaker 4**: No, not.
**Speaker 4**: I don't have really even a ballpark to tell you right now because this came about through kind of a synergy meeting with the board of.
**Speaker 4**: What are we going to do?
**Speaker 4**: Are we just going to say that we are who we are and we're capping everything and have waiting lists or.
**Speaker 4**: Or will we build?
**Speaker 4**: There was even talk of buying the church out here, East Columbus Christian Church, buying them out and using this whole facility, or do we look at surrounding buildings just to see what options are out there?
**Speaker 4**: And that's kind of direction they gave me, is to start researching and see what options are out there.
**Speaker 4**: But we have not talked any kind of numbers.
**Jared**: Okay.
**Jared**: So the.
**Jared**: The Goodwill project was right around 2 million for build out.
**Speaker 4**: Okay.
**Jared**: For this.
**Speaker 4**: Okay.
**Jared**: So I. I don't know what that.
**Jared**: That if that's something that is in your wheelhouse or if you're like, brandon, I got.
**Jared**: I got $200,000.
**Jared**: Like, okay, well, yeah, find a barn.
**Speaker 4**: I would probably have to.
**Speaker 4**: I would hate to speak by myself without getting our business manager and the board in that discussion, but I can definitely, you know, do that and, and let you guys know that.
**Jared**: Yeah, I mean, I'd say as you're looking for spaces, it's an.
**Jared**: Obviously it's important for you guys to know what that budget is because that's going to gear a lot of things on where you're going to go, right?
**Speaker 4**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jared**: You know, because maybe like, again, this.
**Jared**: This building, you know, a lot of.
**Jared**: We get a lot of demo to make this thing work for, for schools, you know, so it's like, maybe there.
**Speaker 4**: If.
**Jared**: If that doesn't work, you got to look at something that is, you know, smaller or you look at like, okay, instead of six classrooms, I mean, we could pro.
**Jared**: I mean, you could.
**Jared**: You could squeeze more out of this, right?
**Jared**: You could do a bank of stuff in the middle here.
**Jared**: And then you have a, you know, a circular.
**Jared**: A circular hallway that goes around and stuff.
**Jared**: So you can maximize the.
**Jared**: Right.
**Jared**: And to where that adjusts your numbers.
**Jared**: Just have to have a target to aim for.
**Kwildey**: And Kendall, do you want to design it in such a way that you can maybe expand later on like that?
**Kwildey**: Well, yeah, like, we don't build.
**Kwildey**: We have plans for three extra classrooms, but we don't build them right now type thing.
**Speaker 4**: That's it.
**Speaker 4**: Yeah, that's a good thought.
**Kwildey**: Just FYI, Kendall, on our side, your cost of upgrades, it's gonna.
**Kwildey**: A good portion of that's gonna get taken out of your lease.
**Kwildey**: So, like, they're gonna reimburse you proportionally.
**Kwildey**: Like, I can't.
**Kwildey**: You're not gonna lose $2 million in lease, but you're gonna get.
**Kwildey**: The bigger the upgrade, the more forgiveness you get, so.
**Speaker 4**: Correct.
**Speaker 4**: So you're just saying the.
**Speaker 4**: The cost per square footage on the lease would be less.
**Kwildey**: Yeah.
**Speaker 4**: Because renovation.
**Speaker 4**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jared**: But assuming they're going to give you ti dollars and amortize it, right, Jared?
**Kwildey**: No, just saved.
**Jared**: Oh, wow.
**Speaker 4**: Okay.
**Speaker 4**: Okay.
**Speaker 4**: So, I mean, Jared, I know you can't disclose exact numbers, but, like, when you were initially talking at a starting of around $15 per square foot for lease, what.
**Speaker 4**: What are we I mean I, I have no idea also from my end too, to know when you're saying that.
**Speaker 4**: Well, what kind of differences difference would it make?
**Kwildey**: I will get, I don't want to, I don't have it in front of me, but I'll get these details.
**Speaker 4**: Okay.
**Kwildey**: I can share of what they did on the goodwill side.
**Kwildey**: I know good ten year lease.
**Speaker 4**: The ten year.
**Speaker 4**: Okay.
**Kwildey**: Year.
**Kwildey**: And they, you know, saved them quite a bit.
**Kwildey**: So I'll get details of that and share that with you.
**Speaker 4**: Well, and, and let me say this.
**Speaker 4**: As well as we're looking at this with the, with a two million dollar Renault and what that, what that looks like with that site and everything, I don't know that we would be opposed to going that far out as well.
**Kwildey**: Okay.
**Speaker 4**: Because, because you know, it's so close and such a nice site and nice building and, and what guys have done with that Renault, the looks of it.
**Speaker 4**: But we're getting to where we're kind of landlocked here anyway, so.
**Speaker 4**: Yeah, this might be more of a long term investment for us.
**Jared**: The good news is it looks like you have roughly 50 to 60 spaces at your disposal for parking.
**Speaker 4**: Okay.
**Jared**: So that should be good.
**Jared**: How's your relationship to the community, specifically the municipality?
**Jared**: Do you know people there?
**Jared**: Because you've got to get, you got to go to the board and get a use change for this.
**Speaker 4**: You asking me?
**Speaker 4**: Yeah, yeah.
**Speaker 4**: I mean I think our relationships would be good.
**Speaker 4**: We've never had a problem with any, you know, the project or anything.
**Speaker 4**: We've had to go, you know, in front of the council to get approval or anything like that.
**Speaker 4**: So I think we'll be fine.
**Speaker 4**: Okay.
**Kwildey**: Yeah, the Christian schools are, they're fine.
**Speaker 4**: Okay.
**Jared**: Yeah.
**Jared**: So because moving this from a business occupancy to a school.
**Jared**: So we have to get this, we have to go in front of the board and get this changed, which we did it for goodwill.
**Jared**: It just took a little bit.
**Jared**: I don't know what the issue was there or something.
**Jared**: So that's why I asked because somewhere, some way somebody was holding something up for.
**Jared**: Yeah, I don't know why.
**Speaker 4**: Yeah, I don't think we would have an issue.
**Speaker 4**: And maybe now that they've approved it for, you know, Excel and it is kind of already educational.
**Speaker 4**: An educational facility.
**Speaker 4**: It might help.
**Jared**: Yes, it should, it should, it should be very quick.
**Jared**: But.
**Jared**: Yeah.
**Jared**: Again, I just don't know the inner working politics of Columbus.
**Jared**: I wanted to make sure there was nothing like.
**Jared**: Well, you know, Joe and I went to school together.
**Jared**: We're not friends.
**Jared**: Okay.
**Speaker 4**: Yeah.
**Kwildey**: Never a guarantee with Columbus, but yeah, yeah, partially there.
**Jared**: Yep.
**Jared**: So as far as timeline goes, because that's going to be important as well.
**Jared**: So, you know, you're gonna take about two months to get design done.
**Jared**: I would give at least another six weeks to get through, because you gotta get through council and then building permit and everything.
**Jared**: So I'd say another six weeks to two months of getting approved.
**Jared**: And normally I would say we'll get started doing stuff, but they're not.
**Jared**: They're not going to let us on this.
**Jared**: What we would do is pull a separate demo permit and go ahead and get started with demo, but we're not going to be able to start throwing up walls or anything until you get through that committee meeting for the use change.
**Jared**: So if you.
**Jared**: If you budgeted about, you know, four months from the time you say go until the time that we would actually get a permit issued, that's reasonable.
**Jared**: And then as far as build time, you're talking six months of construction time.
**Jared**: So, you know, from.
**Jared**: From go time, you're.
**Jared**: You're, you know, 10 months altogether.
**Speaker 4**: Okay.
**Kwildey**: I think their goal is the 2026 school year, so first week of August, that's feasible.
**Speaker 4**: So, yeah, we're.
**Speaker 4**: We're, like, at 13 months right now for everything, so.
**Speaker 4**: Okay, that's good to know.
**Speaker 4**: Thank you.
**Jared**: You're welcome.
**Speaker 4**: So next steps will be for me to get you guys kind of a ballpark of.
**Speaker 4**: We've got this much money to deal with.
**Jared**: So it's.
**Jared**: It's not only that, it's.
**Jared**: All right, here's what we've got.
**Jared**: You know, we've got, you know, whatever that number is, 2 million bucks.
**Jared**: And here's what we need.
**Jared**: We need, you know, six classrooms at a minimum of 600 square feet per.
**Jared**: Or whatever that is.
**Jared**: We need X number of admin offices, we need, you know, student area, a break area for staff, maybe a conference room, you know, whatever, you know, whatever you guys need as far as your stuff.
**Jared**: And then, you know, we're going to have, you know, a bank of restrooms, you know, things like that that we know that we're going to have to have.
**Kwildey**: You know, how long do you think it would take to pull that info together?
**Speaker 4**: Let me look at what we got scheduled.
**Speaker 4**: I probably.
**Speaker 4**: Our board president is out right now.
**Kwildey**: And you got the beginning of school coming up, so I know it's a little hectic time for you.
**Speaker 4**: Yeah.
**Speaker 4**: And we're opening.
**Speaker 4**: We're opening up a new site in Brownstown.
**Speaker 4**: It's taken A lot of time, I would say, before I could have like, anything that really would help you guys, is going to be the third Thursday in August, so.
**Speaker 4**: August 21st.
**Jared**: Okay.
**Jared**: Month from now.
**Speaker 4**: Yeah.
**Jared**: Okay.
**Jared**: Yeah.
**Jared**: Like I said, that works for us.
**Jared**: I mean, obviously it doesn't really change our timeline, so.
**Jared**: Yeah, just keep, keep that, obviously keep that in mind.
**Jared**: Right.
**Jared**: So I don't know how what your approval process is through your board and stuff, but as, as we, as we go through this.
**Jared**: Right.
**Jared**: Like the.
**Jared**: One of the biggest timeline holdups are you typically, like, things get through approval and what not quiet.
**Jared**: And the next thing you know, it's like, hey, we're up against the wall.
**Jared**: Right.
**Jared**: Last thing we want to do is be rushing it, you know, especially if we're into the project and, you know, you guys come in and, you know, your board walks through it during the roughing stage and they're looking at it and, you know, somebody's like, well, I really want this, this and this.
**Jared**: And now we got, you know, some changes that are going to add three weeks, and you don't have three weeks.
**Speaker 4**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jared**: So be cognizant of that.
**Speaker 4**: Okay.
**Kwildey**: Do we want to set up another meeting to discuss or do we want to just expect an email from you between now and then?
**Kwildey**: How do you want to deal with that, Kendall?
**Speaker 4**: I can.
**Speaker 4**: I can do either.
**Speaker 4**: Or if you want to set a meeting up, you know, quickly after that 21st.
**Speaker 4**: Or if you just.
**Speaker 4**: I think all of us are group email now.
**Speaker 4**: Right.
**Speaker 4**: That was coming from maybe AJ had put together.
**Speaker 4**: Yep, yep.
**Speaker 4**: Yeah, we are.
**Speaker 4**: So I can send initial information and get conversation going through that email if that works for everybody too.
**Jared**: Yeah, I'd say let's.
**Jared**: Let's probably go ahead and put something on the calendar for, you know, that right after that meeting just so that we have it.
**Jared**: Because at the end of the day, you know, it's going to be easier for us to talk through what you want and us draw it.
**Speaker 4**: Yeah.
**Jared**: Kind of like what I was today.
**Speaker 4**: Okay.
**Jared**: So if we're looking at the 21st is a Thursday.
